<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇日締約的因果</h3>
<p>日本外務大臣松岡於是歸得東京了。</p>
<p>松岡這一决躬親遠遊，表面上是專誠的報聘德義，實際上是嘗試他所毫無把握而絕對諱言的對蘇聯之外交進攻。專誠報聘，是表面的表面；而窺伺希特勒的眞意，考察德義的內情與實力，審視歐戰前途的勝敗趨勢，私計日本對於三國盟的怎樣纔是比較無害的運用，這是他公開之秘密的使命，亦即是表面的裏面。詎知一到柏林，便逢南斯拉夫鉅變，確示其保全自主獨立的決心，反證了歐洲的和平的新秩序之道之不行；再到羅馬，恰値義國海軍大敗，反證了義國的「內湖」地中海，還在別人所掌握的舊秩序之中。對德義關係的顯然棘手，使日本外交更見得孤弱而徬徨，於是松岡嗒然賦歸，幾無面目，見重江戶父老。幸而在莫斯科再度逗留，簽訂了蘇日協定。</p>
<p>日本對蘇聯，自有其半世紀以來的傳統政策。及至對華作戰陷於重淵，而歐戰又打動了他的南進野心，於是二三年來的對蘇態度，矯爲取媚。析其幻夢，要在怎樣締結條的，調整國交，使蘇聯不復援助中國，助成彼所謂解決中國事變；庶幾騰挪殘餘力量，伺機南進。這樣存心，早已成爲世界論壇的共通診斷。本報亦已一再指陳，以爲日本雖存心若此，蘇日間雖有締結何種條的的可能，然而關於蘇聯援華這一點，則蘇聯決不會放棄之而換取對日的一紙條文，即日本決不會如願以償。到現在，蘇日協定簽字了，所謂調整國交或亦得以此爲基點了，松岡不虛此行，也許大吹大擂，誇爲外交進攻的成功，春風滿面而凱旋了。但本報歷來所指陳的，現在亦得確證未謬。試檢蘇日協定條款，便可了然。</p>
<p>據日本方面所發表的蘇日協定譯文，協定本文四條，交換聲明一件。第一條規定雙方旨在和平友好，彼此尊重領土之完整與不可侵。第二條規定蘇日之中的一國，倘若成爲兩個第三國的軍事行動對象時，他一國應於紛爭期間內嚴守中立。第三第四條無關宏旨。交換聲明書直接稱此協定爲「中立條的」，而涉及中國的滿蒙疆綫。這一協定簽訂之後，事實上一日有效，則在法理上日本即得一日無北顧之憂；久陷深淵之中的日本，必因法理的北顧無憂而感覺安慰；確是，這是日本所久已渴望的安慰，而我們從旁嚴謹的看來，這一法理的安慰，是日本現在所獲的唯一安慰，最高安慰。此外，協定沒有給日本以絲毫的更大安慰。不但如此。日本成爲任何一國的軍事行動對象時，蘇聯絕無中立義務；中日的不宣而戰，蘇聯當然不受本協定拘束而負何義務，亦即仍得繼續推進其數年來一貫的援華政策；假定一個美國或英國，對日作戰時，本協定第二條如何解釋，也還保留着可與吾兩面。因此之故，日本若爲企圖所謂解決中國事變，始結此的，則眞是等於取櫝遺珠；若爲企圖南進而結此的，則實效亦未可遽知，却得幾分安慰，或可視爲幾分鼓勵。</p>
<p>鼓勵祇是鼓勵而已，不成爲日本因此而發動南進的因素。蓋蘇日間的交惡猜忌，是半世紀以來，是非利害，種種空間與時間的總積。謂現憑一紙文書而完全抵消了，我們不敢大膽的這麼深信。但看雙方界綫毘連的一帶，仍將各駐重兵，不爲依然嫌忌却爲什麼？何况從另一循環來推求，別有相生相尅之處：日本南進問題，即使不以對華戰事列入衡量之中，然必以北顧無憂爲先，猶必待德勝英敗之日；德國愈憑武功而進展，則蘇聯必愈强化其對德壓力：蘇聯壓力愈重，則德國制勝的希望愈緲茫；德國緲茫則日本徘徊。雖國際力來的演變未許盡納之於此簡明的方式之中，然相牽相掣的機巧，何容吾定。即如這次的蘇日協定，是日本所渴望蘄求，然而促以成議者，與其謂德國從中拉攏，　寗作相反的觀察，視爲德國向東南歐拓展之後，爲蘇聯所不慊，蘇聯爲在歐洲對付德國起見，始在東方稍假日本以顏色。</p>
<h3>英評論蘇日協定　對現局無大變更　美官方未有驚異表示　德東進政策則逆轉</h3>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、蘇日所簽定之友好與中立條的、乃國際契的之一種新頴形式、在實際上、此中立條的不似不侵犯條的如蘇·南近所簽定者之範圍廣大、蓋蘇·南不侵犯條的規定雙方繼續共友好政策、雖在任何一方被侵略時亦然、而今之蘇。日條的則僅規定一方允予他方爲第三國軍事行動之對象時守中立耳、故在理論上如蘇聯爲軸心國所攻擊、則日本之手腕、爲此的所束縛、同樣的如日本爲任何方面所攻擊、則蘇聯須守中立、但若任何一方採取軍事行動之主動地位、則他方應有何種態度、此則顯無明文規定、此種脫漏、斷非出於疏忽、故甚有意義、因其留下洞開之門戶、以　慮各種事變也是以就整個言、此項約不能謂爲使現局大有變更、若滿洲與外　雙方現局之承認、不過證明現已存在的已成事實之局勢而已、至於蘇聯援助重慶之問題、則已發　之談判　吿中、固一字未提也、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務院對於蘇日之締結中立條的、未有驚異表示、但亦不發批評、一般印象以爲、此約等於無物、並不代表日本所求可展其手腕與用其軍阿於其他方面之真正妥洽、消息靈通方面對於此約將減少蘇聯對華援助一點、表示疑念、如並不消減對華援助、則不解此約如何可有益於日本在華之地位、惟日本對於滿洲邊界不安全之感想、或可稍減耳、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（四）（六）</p>
<h3>美國海軍大觀</h3>
<p>在「伊達華」號或任何戰艦上，只有艦長或元帥（如適在艦上指揮艦隊時）能享受私人的燕居。艦上任何人，不論水手或陸戰隊，一定要習於共同進食，一起穿衣，一起安置弔牀，遊戲或作戰都得在一起。但大家雖都在一起共同生活，這軍艦上的一切倒比世界上任何地方爲乾凈。海軍當局使每個服役於艦上的人，或若干人的一組，對艦上指定的一部份地方，負起整理保護的全責。這種方法頗能收效，因爲每個水手都以爲那砲塔。橋樓，或艦畏所乘用的小艇，是屬於他個人所有的了。有時候這所有權的意義，竟擴而充之，使那些負責於這些地方的水手們，連他自己的弔牀都搬到砲塔或小艇中去睡覺了。</p>
<p>軍艦之上紀律嚴肅，不過比起了陸軍似乎略鬆一些。艦上任何動作，都以軍號爲主。昧爽五時半就吹起了急促的起身軍號，一切於以開始。晚上九時吹熄燈號，一天纔吿結束。一天之中，水手們擦洗台甲，擦亮一切金屬物件，演習開砲，上機械工程課，由牙醫檢騐，理髮，吃三頓食料豐富的正餐，買冰洪淋吃，看報紙，寫伯和遞信。入睡之前，還好看一次電影，或幻燈片，唱唱他們所歡喜的熟歌濫調。</p>
<p>軍官們在船上，常常玩着一種台甲網球，以資活動。水兵們則於每晨九時早操。下午一時一刻至二時半上課，給入伍軍人以必須的訓練。有些水手習學如何航海，或管理機械。駕駛和航海條規，允在學習之例。</p>
<p>船上的麵包房每天做二百四十個大麵包，一百九十個餅。麵包師即由人伍者充任，並由海部授以烹調知識。每天每個士兵所吃的東西，都先由下級軍官嘗過，看它是吾合於標準。如果有差，由他報知指琿官糾止。艦長進餐時，獨自一人在精緻的艙中一個人吃，像「伊達華」戰艦上，則有一個菲列濱籍的僕役，專們侍應他。艦長休息時也後一人，獨自在台甲上散步。</p>
<p>廚子們每天須帶了咖啡壺上台甲受檢查。每個水兵每天可進咖啡十二杯，所以那咖啡壺一天到晚的在那裏煮着，差不多沒有停歇時。船上的冰洪淋售價很低廉，所得盈餘，用之購買電影放映機，和各種運動用具。</p>
<p>不論戰艦，巡洋艦，或驗逐艦，每天晚上總要放映一次電影。軍艦和軍艦在海面上遇到時，就停下來交換影片。</p>
<p>船上理髮，兵七每次美金一山半，軍官二角半。依據海軍條例，士兵們的頭髮不能任其長至二英寸以外。兵士們空下來之後，或自由閱讀書報，或繕寫家信。船上有特備的信箱。</p>
<p>軍官們閒暇之時，可以在休息室打紙牌，或揀着目己的「好癖」，任意消遣。艦上設有活動鑄宇機，這是海部所規定的常備裝置，每大在船上發行報紙·編輯即由艦上的牧師担任。</p>
<p>水兵們資格老的，可以睡行軍牀，新入伍者則臥於弔牀中。他們每人有一個雜物橱，除了厚大衣外服之外，所有軍帽，手巾，盥用具，甚至他愛人的照片等，一古攏兒都安放在內。</p>
<p>（二）海上演習戰一瞥</p>
<p>美國海軍在演習作戰時，她的假想敵是誰，我們都不言可喩。底下所紀的，爲參於美國海軍演習戰新聞記者的報吿。文內所稱「我們」者，係指美國海軍艦隊而言。（未完）</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米又在掀騰中　昨日到米又有三萬餘包　一日中米價漲起七八元</h3>
<p>洋米不斷來滬、怡和洋行明生輪、前日（十三日）到埠、由香港裝來洋米一萬四千六百四十七包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司海口輪昨日下午到滬、亦由香港裝來洋米一萬七千七百五十包、停靠法租界本行碼頭、今晨開始起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨晨開市後、因連日休假、本客實銷添辦極濃、而內地與滬西幫需胃更貪、投機幫掀風作浪、浮囤散戶之推波助瀾、允使市面造成緊張而又極嚴重之局勢、謠詠允見紛起、若暹邏禁止也、香港禁運也、日軍南進也、無不爲執貨者抬價扳俏之工具、而西貢通運定貨源源而來、反而占小到重要位置、即新成交又有西貢四五月份一千噸成議、價一百三十六元、一說一百）三十五元半、由慎記拋出、此外尙有二三起亦有成議之可能、然市面緊張如故、早市一號西　已開到一百十九元、二號為一百十五六元、二號　　一百十八元、火紋一百十八元、小絞白身一百十六元、中關一百十四五元、東京砶尖一百十元、　至一百零七元、碎尖九十五六元、　至九十元左右、比節前漲四五元、午後買氣益濃、一號竟有一百二十一二元之喊聲、英華司成交號二四月一百三十七元、二號現一百三十八元半、混合碎一百零九元半至一百十元、三號碎米九十八元、小絞現一百三十九元至一百四十元、午後則有加起二三四元之喊聲、全日成交英華司近三千噸、現米三寓多包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、因數朝停市、來源積夥不下一二百石、而銷塲方面一般作客見洋米如此堅緊、納胃因之亦濃、貨主逢此良機、售意愈緊、猛喊亂扳、但結果以去路雖佳、終小若洋米之廣、到貨適復見旺、難能與洋米抗衡、僅提二元半光景、計開常幫特粳斛見百二十五元、崑山斛見特粳百二十二元、高百二十元、次至中關百十六七元、原包特粳百三十元、靑角斛見薄稻百卞四五元、</p>
<p>糯米素隨洋米起伏、茲際佳檔、零躉　銷均暢、售價並駕齊驅、暴升四五元之巨、開香港特元百十五元、次至百十元、糯　百零三元、次至一百元云、</p>
<h3>麫粉激升元餘</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨爲雜糧市塲　春假後開市之期、因金融證券紗花尙未開市、業內外蒞塲者頗衆、本客實銷進胃俱佳、聞西貢洋米來源有被阻消息、米價猛升四元、以致人心惶惶、投機買戶、趁此拉抬、市面在競買中、激升一元有奇、計開花鳥牌澳粉三十元〇七八角、金龍牌坎粉三十元至三十元〇一角、汽船脾三十元〇一角、成交達二萬餘包、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十五元、聞廠方以原料將罄、將停止供給之說、故市面頗有漲勢、</p>
<p>麥市　小麥市况、亦屬暗堅、查市塲現貨供源早枯、偶有零星附近杜麥運到、均被日廠收去、售價爲四十五六元、整批交易、概無所聞、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆油漲起二三元</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市塲已假滿照常開市、大局尙無特殊劇變、一度雖受謠風影響、各種市價曾一致騰躍、然賣買雙方心思尙乏興奮、故不久即復歸軟勢、但環境允屬利多、潛勢尙有榮難辱、計油市比假前漲起二一二元、成交期現大連油六百桶、廠油三百担、簍油十件、黃豆提砌半元左右、交易各豆一千七百餘包、苞米惟荷蘭貨趨緊、西貢貨先緊後疲。共成交現貨二千五六百包、期貨三百噸、豆餅實銷寥寥、行情雖漲二三角不等、但完全由踢皮球生意所造成也、今日有豆油一千聽運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　期糖復升</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢因難以鬆弛、致期貨復升五角、公會劃盤二四粗白現貨八十九元六角至五角、復到六角、計小二角、本月二十日打單由八十九元九角至九十元零一角、再以一角、步回至八十九元七角、計升五角、月底打單者九十元四角、五角·七角。九角。九十一元、復至九十元零五角、計升三角、太古車白較平、DY嘜西棧八十五元五角不更、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮尚穩定</h3>
<p>白鉛皮到銷兩稀、趨勢無甚進展、惟在各貨行盤銳漲中、標準依然穩站、查是貨爲電池廠之惟一原料、目前電池廠已自滬遷之八九、而白鉛皮又在被禁出口品之例、無法運往內地、實銷隨之難暢、此外雖由木街印書房茶棧等略見問津、然共數並不衆多、而同業人心不軟、故開價仍堅挺、昨如四號五號六號每桶售三千八百元、八九·十·十二·十四號則每桶開四千五百元、</p>
<p>昨有舊銅一百五十件自香港裝來、</p>
<h3>煤炭　熟煤有行無市</h3>
<p>熟煤行情、自前月印度煤做高以後、自來火行對於同業客戶、即停止出售、致有行無市、本街各店祇得抬價向囤戶搜購老棧單、車貨應市、故近日暗盤已喊四百元、門莊發客、篩塊每噸四百念八元、零售每担念二元云、</p>
<h3>雜項　國貸蚊香　價較客歲漲二成</h3>
<p>蚊烟香夏令必需之品、天氣日漸轉暖、廠方派至同業行銷、大都送到市價、較客歲漲達二成、銷路比前减退、因淪陷區域受某方束縛、多銷東貨猪牌以致國貨蚊香、頗趨暗淡、目下買價如三星牌大號十九元、二號十五元八角、三號十三元九角、散裝四元八角、</p>
<h3>銀錢業星期六　休假的取銷　張孟昭</h3>
<p>銀錢　星期六下午休假問題、筆者會因此舉妨碍工商業、故爲文商榷、刋之本攔　（見去年拙作銀錢業星期六休假之不當一文）、不意竟引起銀錢業從業員諸君之反響、殊不知不佞所欲言者、在此非常時期、旣不加倍工作、亦當恪守成規、不應以偶然之事故、因噎廢食、而應照常營業、以利顧客、（並非對人問題、）誠以銀錢業負有調劑金融與輔助工商業發展之使命、故對於工商業往來上之便利、銀綫業應負起全責、試看自星期六下午休業、所予工商業之不便如何、再加以實行新鐘點、工廠·公司·商號之收款解款、非但趕小及、甚且少做不少生意、尤以商界營業所入、必須隔一日半，始得將累積鉅款解交銀行庫房、因之多担不少風險、又商家與進貨銷貨之間之貨款支票授受方面、亦以限於星期六下午休假、而深感不便、種種吃虧、（例如頭寸之調度時間侷促及賠累利息等等……）一言難盡、至於銀錢業本身收解有無困難、尙未計及、頃讀本報十三日重慶電云、「我國各銀行向例多於星期六下午停止營業、以便整理一週間內部帳目、四聯總處、以當此抗建時期、各銀行自應增加營業時閒、提高工作效率、特由理事會決議、自四月半起、中·中·交·農·西行及郵滙局、中信局、均應於星期六下午照常營業、並函請財政部令飭各地方銀行及商業銀行一律照辦」云云、確係應有之義、如今在上海之中·中·交·農·四行理應遵照辮理、不再遲疑、即上海之各商業銀行、亦將何說之有、可不虞再有提存時、束手無策、鬧到七八點鐘、何况以後當不致再有星期六下午提存情事發生、故各銀行理應遵令、即日恢復星期六下午營業、不要以爲處在孤島上政令有所不及、而敢藐視、若如此作爲、簡直只圖自私、不顧公益、而自居化外矣、</p>
<h3>乾果預防霉蛀　不久將貯存冷藏庫</h3>
<p>乾果中不易棧守者、當推桂圓乾與荔枝乾兩種、如鮮果成乾時水份遺留較多、即易發霉變壞、故隨時有巡視之必要、而荔枝乾更不容疏忽、蓋登新時雖用炭火焙乾、然其果核往往未能即乾、就能因果核上之潮氣而致發霉或蟲蛀、如烏葉枝及蘭竹枝之類、因其核較大、均易發生此患、允有貪利之貨主、對於新貨桂圓荔枝、每以烘焙未足之貨應售、蓋水份未盡、則斤量自重、得利較厚耳、殊不知身份旣潮、即不能久擱、貨主祇圖目前之計殊未顧及承購者之利害也、查前低價時、此種事實演出最烈、因發霉扣重而損失者、爲數實可驚人、後經本市號行雙方整頓後、上述逐漸絕跡、現在價格旣高、此風已不多見、惟有兩時期、此爲天然所不能免者、一爲黃霉季節、身份隨而潮潤而發霉而蟲蛀變壞、故執貨者在此兩時期前、預爲烘焙、方免後患、現在更能藉科學方法、以度此難關、如屆黃霉時節可先貯存冷氣棧中、則霉蛀兩患、俱可防免、茲爲時已近、又因人工炭價奇昂、本年所存桂圓荔枝兩貨、大部份均將往冷氣棧邇暑、大的五月初進棧至八九月間方能出棧應市、經此一番冷藏保守、貨之優美質地、旣可保持不變、且可權充新貨、然價格因冷氣費昂、自然增高、大的每百市斤按月須五六元、每擔經四五閱月即須二三十元、近聞業中人預籌及此、不久將有大批桂圓荔枝送入冷藏棧矣</p>

<h3>米價飛漲工潮迭起　囤米將强迫出售　昨日市價又被劇烈抬高　但存底充沛到貨又擁擠</h3>
<p>投機份子濫施謠言當局決予從嚴懲處</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據今晨（十四日）可靠之華人方面消息、工部局不久將實行特種辦法、强迫囤戶出售其所囤積之米糧、此項辦法之詳細情形、尙不能確知、因今日係假日、無法向工部局探詢證實、</p>
<p>昨日飛漲</p>
<p>本埠米市、自廢除限價後、漲勢即無法遏止、昨掃墓假後第一日開市、市價在投機份子濫　謠傳之下、每石國　米價格、飛漲竟達四五元之鉅、兩租界常局若再不堅決採取嚴厲之制裁辦法、則本市民食前途、殊屬可慮、且近日工潮迭起、莫不以米價高漲爲厲階、關係治安實極重、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>投機慣技</p>
<p>昨日米價之漲因、爲一般投　份子以日蘇中立條的簽訂後、恐日本南進在即、故競向市塲搜購現貨、而一般囤有大宗現貨之囤戶、復居奇抬高、致市價越抬越高、西貢一號米每石由一百十四元漲至一百十九元、此種不法份子、每伺局勢稍有變動、即施其投機之慣技、以遂其私慾、昨據某專家稱、日蘇簽訂中立條　、於遠東局勢雖有變動、但在英德有事於巴爾幹之時、尙須有待、投機份子竟以此爲抬高米價之藉口、殊屬無稽、</p>
<p>應禁杰購</p>
<p>又據某正常米商稱、本市存米充沛、足供五月餘之需、而來源又極暢通，太平洋局勢雖或有變動、本市民食、亦可無慮、昨日一日閒運抵木埠洋米之總數、達四萬餘包、　國米到貨、昨亦突增、况洋米四月份之訂貨、亦達四十餘萬包、故當局如能制止投機份子在市塲搜購現貨、再實行客售與行行售與號之規則、則投機份子雖在市塲濫肆無稽謠言、亦不致如是猖獗、</p>
<p>懲治從嚴</p>
<p>又悉本埠米糧限價、雖已廢除、但兩租界當局、對懲治囤積居奇之徒、仍將依照國府頒佈之非常時期取締囤積居奇法令處治之、「凡非經營本業者、而將貨物囤積超過一定數量者、及經營木業之人、囤積貨物而有居奇操縱行爲者、均須受嚴重處罰」、</p>
<h3>百元鈔塗改地名者　禁止使用</h3>
<p>國府爲防止資金逃避、故曾三令五申、禁阻資金外流、乃一般　令智昏之徒、視政令如具文、自陪部偷運白元鈔來滬（均印　重慶地名）從巾漁利、蓋每萬滙水的達三千餘元、因此當局令禁印有重慶之白元鈔及摺有縐紋者一律拒　使用、同時獎勵資金內移、故凡將此項鈔票滙寄內地者、得予破格收受、自此項辦法實行後、竟又將重慶地名加印上海地名、希圖在市混用、故中行當局又復公吿、此項加印地名百元票、亦在禁用之列、望全市民衆注意、免受損失而爲奸徒所乘、</p>
<h3>信誼藥廠　股東大會　定今日舉行</h3>
<p>信誼藥廠創立以來、已十有七年、所製造之各種新藥、如消治龍等、與歐美出品、不分軒輕、此外更設有玻璃儀器廠·血淸疫苗廠·橡皮膠廠、同時並由美國麥令克勞特化學製藥公司英國製藥公司委託經銷各種試騐用及分析用試藥、該廠在鮑總經理主持下、營業日盛、資本增至數百萬元、聞該廠定今日召開股東大會、討論發行新股發展業務等問題、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、上海自由法國運動領袖愛高、自本月五日起、遭此間法海軍當局拘禁於法砲艦茄納號上、至昨日（十三日）午後四時三十分、被押登法國郵船公司「金第亞」號輪前往西貢受審、昨日午後二時、法當局召愛高之夫人及其律師普萊梅登茄納號艦、吿以愛高將於數小時內離滬赴越南、「金第亞」號起椗前的半小時、愛高即被押入小艇、轉登「金第亞」號、而不計受高　人登該輪與其良人言別、</p>

<h3>貧病的福音</h3>
<p>— 青萍</p>
<p>中華健康協會訪問記</p>
<p>前進的醫界人士，同情貧病，為人類健康而創設的醫學團體衛生機關，寄來頗有風起雲湧之勢，而中華健康協會便是這些團體中辦理最完善工作最認真的一個。他們真正是為社會服務，為病家除疾苦，並促進民眾衛生智識為職責，醫師們都是很有經驗，很有研究的專家。因此觸動我前去訪問的動作。</p>
<p>在星期四下午，我約西風社黃氏昆仲嘉德·嘉音·伴用前去訪問。中華健康協會會址在池浜路四十一號、就在愛文義路口，交通相當便利。這座房子是中華醫學會建造的。中華醫學會和中華健康協會實際是兩位一體。中華醫學會是學術性的，以改進醫學事業，提創衛生教育等等為宗旨；中華健康協會是技術性的，便是辦理衛生事業，直接為病家服務，促進人類健康。這座房子並不是高大的洋樓，要是從它的外表觀察，將使作驚奇地不相信者會是全國醫學界的寶庫，和醫師們為病家診療的那種緊張情形。我們看到了豐富的古代醫學文獻和各國的醫學雜誌等等。（這當為文另述之）</p>
<p>在一件陳設簡單的會客室裹，我們會見了中華健康協會的總幹事歐陽忠醫學博士；醫界前輩王吉民氏，他是中華醫學會醫務幹事，中華醫史學會會長，國立醫學院教授；方於去年學成歸國的余新恩博士，余醫士對胸腔肺癆研究深邃，現任中華健康雜誌編輯，中華健康協會會員組主人兼公共實驗區護士部主人何祝萱小姐。承他們告訴我關於中華健康協會的組織·工作·和設施等等情形。</p>
<p>中華健康協會雖是去年七月一日才在上海正式成立，可是以實際的工作而言，它已經有著幾年的歷史了。這個機關是一些熱心社會事業的醫師，公共衛生專家，和明會工作者所組成者，許多重要的醫學團體和衛生機關如中國防癆協會·中國預防花柳病協會·中華麻風救濟會·上海節育研究社·中華慈幼協會·中國婦女會·中華牙醫學會·紅十字會·中華醫學會·中華科學會等等都有代表參加，它所包括的單位很多，實際也可說是上述各團體的聯合組織。</p>
<p>該會現任理事是：會長朱恒　博士（上海醫學院代理院長），副會長刁信德博士（中華麻風救濟會會長），司庫富文壽博士（營養促進會會長），秘書施思明（中華醫學會總幹事），海深德博士（上海肺病醫院院長），王淑貞博士（上海西門婦孺醫院院長），沈驥英博士（上海節育指導所秘書），周誠滸博士（上海醫學院眼科主任），鄭全牙科醫師（中華牙科協會會長）。此外執行幹部是：宣傳組主任黃惠光博士（診療所婦孺衛生醫師），會員組主任何祝萱小姐（公共衛生護士長），公共衛生實驗區主任黃懷信博士，總幹事歐陽忠博士（診療所普通科及麻風科醫師）。</p>
<p>中華健康協會的宗旨「在使民眾感覺健康之重要，使中國在健康及體格方面成為一等國家」。該會目下的主要工作集中於公共衛生新閘實驗區。這個實驗區過去幾年原在中華醫學會主持下，已經有過優異的成績。他們的工作，可分兩部：一部是設立診療所，第二部實公共衛生護士部的護士訓練和服務；兩部份密切合作，以期獲取最大的效果。診療所又分為癆病·眼科·花柳病·婦嬰·節育·牙科·和普通科九部分，各科都由醫學湛深，富於服務精神的專門醫師主持。這個新閘實驗區的地域是以愛文義路以北，蘇州河以南，程度路以西，卡德路以東為界，這個區域內的居民至少有百分之八十是貧苦民眾，實際上是一個貧民窟，因此他們的健康很成問題而患了病又無力醫治，所以中華健康協會選定這個區域為實驗區，是非常有意義。所以這些診療所便是以中下階級的人士為對象。診金及醫藥費非常低廉；初診須付掛號費一角，複診每次五分，如確係赤貧無力納費者，得免費治療，甚至藥品亦全部奉送。他們的主要目的，乃在指示並教導疾病預防的重要，對於前來就診者，除給予必要的治療外，更由醫師或護士告以各種疾病的預防方法，及一般的衛生常識，並派護士到各病人家中訪視，給予適當的幫助和忠告。</p>
<p>公共衛生護士部的工作分為門診部和家庭訪視部，主持的人是位精明强幹，經驗豐富的何祝萱小姐。何小姐具有壯健的體格，柔和的性情，熱心服務等幾種美德，正適合她擔任這部辛勞艱鉅的工作。現有護士八位，這些小姐都是護士學校畢業，經過特殊訓練，每人都抱著服從和犧牲的精神，埋頭苦幹，所以人數雖少，卻已做出許多值得稱讚的成績來。她們在門診部除了協助診療工作和各項檢查外，最重要的工作是衛生教育，在這方面她們舉行　向候診的病人演講，各種衛生常識及預防疾病的重要和方法；　與病人作個別談話，調查與他們有關的社會問題和衛生問題，幫助他們解決種種困難；　向就診的婦人灌輸家庭衛生和婦嬰衛生常識；　組織兒童會參加者全是實際，區內沒有機會入學的學童，教導衛生常識並訓練衛生習慣，更教他們唱歌，算術，識字，寫字，使這些不幸的孩子也有機會一嘗幼稚園和小學校的生活滋味。平時則由護士隨時作家庭訪視，督促這些兒童實行衛生習慣。</p>
<p>中華健康協會的工作，雖著重這實驗區，事實上，他們不只限於這個範圍以內，區外的窮苦人家如需要醫療和衛生的幫助者，該區工作人員也是一視同仁，樂於服役的。他們為這些貧苦民眾療病，既不想病家徵收昂貴的診金，而且還得協助工部局衛生處發現有患麻瘋病的人，便強迫送到健康協會加大診療所質疑的麻瘋診療所去診治，因為目前上海只有這一家專看麻瘋病的診所。照這情形，租界當局似應當有一筆鉅額的經費補助他們，但事實上工部局每年只補助他們伍佰元，健康協會的主持者屢次向工部局要求增加補助費，而結果因工部局財政竭蹶一無效果。所以中華健康協會雖然擔負著民族健康的社會工作，而他們的經費卻非常艱窘，過去都是靠地方公團和何人的捐助目前因為戰事關係，經費來源已日漸減少。聽說熱心社會公益的馮炳南先生等，正在設法替他們籌款。該會本身為求基礎強固，工作的發展起見，亦正在廣募會員。事實上對於每一會員全年祗收會員費兩元，而他們所給予每一會員的利益，計有　領取健康證章，　領取健康記錄，　贈閱中華健康雜誌全年，　免費檢查身體，免費注射防疫針及免費種痘等，數倍於數納的會費。我想社會人士一定樂予贊助，踴躍參加的。（完）</p>

<h3>衛丹醫學博士　在滬時之偉大成功</h3>
<p>衛丹博士所發明之鼻端接觸療治新法，應診以來，大著成效。第一日到診者，甚為踴躍，在本十日內，源源而來，大有山陰道上應接不暇之勢。</p>
<p>凡初經博士診治者，對於此新法，均感其效如神，著手回春。在此星期內，尤以患氣喘者，見效更速，每有患此癥者多年，初次施術後，其病若失，更嘆觀止。</p>
<p>至於風濕骨痛，胃病，神經衰弱，經博士治愈者，大不乏人。尚有精神頹喪得治後返老還童。更有兒童之發育遲緩，智慧愚鈍，神經過敏，亦經治愈。由此觀之，博士療治新法，雖極簡單，而神效卓著，人皆以為扁鵲再世。按衛丹博士之新法，用金屬小棒接觸鼻內之粘液膜各神經要點。受治者並無痛苦，不過面部紅潤，雙目潤濕，間或噴嚏，表示患者已得該治法之良好反應。蓋衛丹博士已將患者之交感大神經恢復其正常之功用也。</p>
<p>衛丹博士在滬開診未久，著此神效，殊非偶然倖致，實由衛丹博士在巴黎開設交感大神經療養院時，早見成效。根據一萬次之診治所得結果，有如下表丫</p>
<p>氣喘百分之八十八　燥急與昏昧百分之七十九　失眠百分之八十四　神經衰弱百分之八十二　頭痛百分之八十　神經郭明百分之七十八　胃病百分之九十　風濕百分之七十七　神經痛百分之八十一　精神緊張百分之七十八　咽喉癥百分之六十　氣管病百分之九十　痢疾百分之六十五　半身不遂百分之五十　其他癱瘓百分之三十　經病百分之七十八　腦神經及未老先衰百分之九十　以上統計數字，更毋庸解釋，足證衛丹博士今日之成功殊非偶然悻致。深望衛丹博士勿　離滬，俾患者得所問津而出苦海焉。查衛丹博士現寓外灘華　飯店七〇七號房間。應診時間為上午十時至十二時，下午四時至六時，（星期六下午星期日停診）</p>
<p>茲悉衛丹博士將於星期五即四月十八日，下午八時〇五分，在英文大美晚報電臺播音演講云（XMHC週波七百）</p>

<p>摘錄　人生有限、書籍無窮、讀而不能記、記而不得　、也是罔然、何況中人之資、走馬看花、隨讀隨忘、補救之法、就再摘錄、例如顧亭林常說「善讀書、不如善抄寫、」日知錄、東讀書習記、曾文正公嘉一抄、都是有陸續抄錄、雜湊而成、我有一位朋友、將聊齋志異中出典、及辭源中的成語、分類抄錄、久而成　一卷、隨手翻閱、應用自如、又有一個學生、國文成績、原本尋常、然而士別三日、便當刮目相待、那知他在三年之中、摘錄辭句、分門別類、有十本之多、體例略如坊間所出之作文辭典等書、這雖不是研究國文頂好的方法、可是選擇之時、要加鑒別、既錄之後、要加處理、無形中養成讀書時注意的習慣、我們倒亦未可厚非吧、</p>
<p>卡片　這正是仿照圖書館的編制目錄的方法、將平時所閱讀的報章雜誌、不管是討論問題、或發表意見的、把篇名、卷數、頁數、時間、作者、記錄在卡片上、按照內容的性質、分出幾個部門、藏在定製成小方格的抽屜中、遇到我要研究問題、發表一篇著作時、可隨時檢查、加以綜合與分析的研究、那麼材料一多、稍加整理、即可作成一篇洋洋大觀的文章、在人家看來、以為他是讀書破萬卷、下筆如有神、不知全靠這許多的小卡片、駕御他半日所讀的材料、順手拈來、既省時間、又節腦力、免得張惶失措、東翻西閱、這又合了而不為、</p>
<p>朗誦　白話文或可不朗誦、而散文不可不朗誦、散文或可不朗誦、而詩文則決不可不朗誦、因為文章的結構、在實質方面、固然要注重他的思想與內容、談到形勢方面。不要說是詩詞歌曲、是有音節的、就是散文、例如「雲從龍、鳳從虎、聖人作而萬物觀、」「恍兮惚、其中有物、惚兮恍、其中有象、」辭句之間、何嘗沒有自然地音節、有些學生、做起文來、拖泥帶水、嚕嚕　　全由於平日不讀、或者是讀的太少、沒有留心到字句之整齊、音節之鏗鏘、氣勢之雄偉、那自然得不到行文的三昧了、例如孟子之條暢、韓非子之精悍、莊子之汪洋恣肆、昌黎之翻騰反復、歐陽修之婀娜多姿、如不高聲朗誦、那能了解他們的陽剛與陰柔之美呢、</p>
<p>吟哦　中國的文字、是有單因而成、而詩詞歌曲、所以音節和諧、成為美文的原因、就是有　多聯綿字、或是雙聲、或是疊韻、或是疊字、再加以平上去入之變化、開齊合撮之分別、於是人於耳者、有高下疾徐、輕聲抑揚之妙、千古才人、心領神會、所以才創出許多不朽之作來、雖有秦始皇之橫暴、楚霸王之跋扈、也不是一把野火、所恩那個燒得乾乾淨淨的、古詩十九首中、什麽青青、　　、盈盈、皎皎、娥娥、織織都是疊字、妙之　李清照作的、　　、冷冷清清、淒淒慘慘、切切、那就全身用疊字而成、凡讀音相同的、叫疊聲、收音相同的叫疊韻、例如窈窕、　勉、踟躕、邂逅、沮　、　　、　　、　　、……只要翻　　經、俯拾皆是、我們讀到這類詩不曼聲吟哦、那能知道他們的入神與初花之妙呢、（未完）</p>

<p>敎育</p>
<h3>民主歟？獨裁歟？</h3>
<p>— 潘禮</p>
<p>美國本雪文尼亞州喬治學校的社會科學生，對於民主政治的生活方式，表示懷疑，他們以爲民王政體太缺乏工作效率了。他們以爲獨裁政體才是有效率的。</p>
<p>敎師麥菲萊有口難辯，就說，『那麼好吧，要解決民主政體　獨裁政治的好壞問題，唯一的辦法是靠實地的試騐。我們爲試騐起見，本級將於下兩星期中實施獨裁制度。』　於是在課室裏禁止討論，不許發問，對小及格者施以嚴厲的刑罰。此外，麥菲萊還組織了　個小小的秘密警察隊，指定四個學生做秘密警察，暗中探聽學生在課外所說的話，記錄下來。接着有一天，麥菲萊突然把學生私下批評他和別個敎員的　，學生問的流言秘語，和犯規的事件，公開宜讀出來。學半聽到這裏，莫不愕然大驚，地們開始感覺到獨裁政體的醜惡了。於是，在實行獨栽政制的第五天，全體學生一致要求恢復民主政體。</p>
<p>這雖然不過是一件趣事，可是也不無相當的意義與敎訓。</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>自然界的偽裝</h3>
<p>— 劍晨</p>
<p>假設僞裝（Le　Comauflage）是「軍事上的一種技術，目的在於隱蔽自己行軍的眞像，以便消極的躱避敵人的攻擊，和積極的容易襲擊敵人，」如同軍事專家給它下的定義一樣，那麼，在自然界中的先例，更是不勝枚舉的，不過設計的是人自然罷了。所以僞裝，又是我們人類所最見長的一套抄襲的把戲！</p>
<p>變色</p>
<p>在自然界中，戰爭的狀態是常川存在着的：弱小的動物，不能不借着保護色以苟延殘喘，如同草中的蝗虫作綠色，冬天的狐兎作白色；而兇猛的傢伙，像非洲沙漠當中褐色的獅子，和北極冰雪上面白色的大熊呢，也樂得披上一身同環境相混不惹人注目的毛皮，以便掩襲和攫食。這小由的叫人想起平原國家的軍人服裝，大多數用灰用綠，而前年抵抗蘇聯的芬蘭國的軍人服裝，却正是雪白的！至於能隨時隨地急劇變色的種種動物，譬如章魚，烏賊，伊索龍蝦，和那最著名的蜥蜴等，或者可比之於那些朝三暮四，變化靡常，能化裝喬扮成各種各色人物的間謀們的行動吧！</p>
<p>擬態</p>
<p>有一種名叫「枯葉蝶」的昆虫，牠得名的由來，是當牠飛倦休息時，便把兩翅併合起來，隱去鮮明的色彩，所露在外　的顏色脈紋，却完全彷彿一片枯葉。其他能作擬態的動物，非常之多。我想在上次歐戰時，聯軍方面，爲偵得德方行軍的消息起見，夜間把山坡上一座敎堂鐘樓前的聖像搬下來，換上一座預先仿造好的完全一樣的像，不過是中部空虛能容偵察者的藏身；還有裝枯樹，裝死馬，把兵艦扮作商艦的模樣，以便魚目混珠的種種舉動，是可以歸人此例的。</p>
<p>冒牌</p>
<p>海岸附近有一種沙蟹，喜歡咬囓海草附著在自已的背或腿上，海草繼續生長，不久，便成了一座活動的植物園。又有種「寄居蟹，」把牠的軟尾塞在蚌螺的空殼中，然後取一兩株海葵負在背上，緩緩遊行。我們看看這是不是那些被樹枝縱橫掩覆着的祖克車或裝甲車的縮影呢？又有一種名叫磧鶸（C　affinch）的鳥，能用苔蘚地衣等物，假裝其巢，呌人不容易辨認出來。戰爭時，大多數的崗位，砲位，司令部，上面全支架着滿綴靑枝綠葉的魚網，叫敵人撲朔迷離，分不淸是眞的樹林或假的樹林來；這種行亂不是同磧鶸鳥如出一轍麼？</p>
<p>護符</p>
<p>烏賊能噴吐墨水如同施放烟幕一樣，前已談過。意大　沿海一帶，又有一種名叫Heteroteuthis的槍　：牠能從特別的腺中，放出一種發光的分泌物，把牠自己團團圍住，儼如包裹在一片「火雲」裹！我們拿這兩種東西象微如今正在地中海作戰的那些軍艦的動作吧：或藉烟幕彈，以混亂敵人的目標，或放探照燈，以驚嚇敵機的來侵！</p>
<p>偽死</p>
<p>有些動物像跳沙蟲，草履蟲，某種蜣螂和刺蝟，一遇着危險，便馬上捲縮成一團，動也不動，儼如死去一般，好叫敵人不去注意，把牠們當成石塊沙礫等沒有生命的東西。記得上一次歐戰中，有一隻潛艇，受敵人猛烈的追擊，要想安然逃出重圍是很困難的。駕駛者忽然異想天開，把汽油箱故意弄開，把油撒出去，於是海面上浮起一道明耀而滿含油痕的浪花。敵人以爲已經　中了它，不必再浪費砲彈了，這駕駛員的詭計得售，竟安然說離了虎口！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>最使她爲難的其實還是父親的依舊回來，和哥哥的突然相偕北返，改上西山去養病；因爲最初她父親原說過不慣那種　姨丈人」的生活，打算利用從袁寳藩手裏所弄到的幾千塊錢，帶往杭州去，一面治理他兒子的肺病，一面就在南方找個落脚，不再重回天津。那知一到杭州，正碰上他妹丈丟掉了浙江省公署的原差不幹，想上廣州去當電報局長，同時葛嶺療養院的費醫生——就是向來給湘綺的哥哥治病，而且已治得有了一些起色的那個醫生。——也因合同期滿，忽忽就要回美國去了，臨走時便把北京郊外西山上的一家醫院鄭重推荐給他們，因此羅家父子倆便反而一齊回到北方來，使湘綺平添兩重大累，再也不敢想到出走這一個念頭了。</p>
<p>但留在袁家，即使袁寳藩心裹不起什麼疑心，自已又怎麼留得住？將米孩子下地之後，難道眞的打算認老袁做爸爸嗎？</p>
<p>可是腹部的高漲已不容她再遲疑了，沒奈何只得暫時讓袁寳藩沾些便宜，故意裝得鄰重其事的把這個喜訊吿訴了他，勉强使事態緩和了下去。</p>
<p>這在秋海棠的心頭上，自然更是一件不可開交的大事，他一方面要爲湘綺担憂，惟恐在她分娩之前，就會有人把這中閒的眞相吿訴袁寳藩：一方面又不勝替自己焦急，深怕將來孩子落地之後，竟給袁寳藩領去，從此便和自己成爲永不相識的陌生人。</p>
<p>他的思想儘管並不頑同，年紀儘管很輕，什麼　宗嗣問題」「嗣續問題」的一類念頭，儘管還沒有鑽進他的腦神經來，但他總不能改變自己的個性！他是一個最歡喜孩子的人，全世界的孩子，在他心目中看來，沒有一個不是活潑可愛的小天使；何况這個未來的小天使，還是他和湘綺的愛情結晶品呢？要他甘心放棄他，實在是一件不可能的事。（八一）</p>

<h3>時間的石像</h3>
<p>— 祝敔</p>
<p>有許多人設時間是老人，時間怎是老人？時間不會老的，會老的是你自己。那麼時間是行麼？時間是未完成的石像</p>
<p>沒有人知道這塊石頭從什麼地方來的——你可曾知道時閒怎樣來的？它大概是一塊寳貴的石頭，質地也一定堅硬得很。它站在世界上每個人都要走過的地方，走過了，那個人便不會回來；於是每個人在走過的一次，拾起前人遺下的鑿子，在它身上彫刻。懶惰的人刻了一刀走了；而勤勞的人一直不肯放鑿直到他不能呼吸；不幸的人未近它的身便夭折了；而庸碌的人刻不出一個痕跡。石上佈滿了刀痕，人也走過了不知多少。啊呀！這是一個多麼艱重而持久的工作！</p>
<p>但是它始終不成其爲一個完成的石像。</p>
<p>它的耳自己刻出，但是只有一點輪廓；它的手足已顯出，但還是糢糊的一段。它幾乎　來的時候差不多。</p>
<p>前人怎麼這樣不努力？有人在吐怨。吐怨對嗎？我們不能怪過去的，倒不如怪自己不努力。我們一生過得多貪安又多怠惰呀！假說我們活六十歲，我們彷彿睡在床上六十年不停地做着夢，而不久我們都已變成過去了，未在石像上動過一刀。</p>
<p>前人曾經努力過的，那粗糙的綫條正是他們工作的符號。他們有的是天才，有的是英雄，有的是但留工作不留姓名的好漢……總之，他們以各自的能力在時間的石像上刻了難刻的一點綫條。他們實在勝過我們，我們再能蹉跎下去？工作確實艱難，有時要虎口裂開，汗流浹背，手足酸麻，但拚將上去，刻牠幾刀，光榮使是你的了。</p>
<p>時間是個永久不會完成的石像。</p>
<p>那麼就專心一意地工作下去吧，工作着的人！你還是默默無聞地走過時問的石像，還是貢獻你的一份工作得到普遍的贊美？你大槪已想明白了，就用力打你的鑿子吧，你只有道寳貴的一次。</p>
<p>時間是個不會完成的石像，但却希望它變成一樣傑作。未完成的傑作將是一種怎樣精極的藝術品！傑作要你的良心，熱血，人格；你如果爲人卑賤，惡劣，你不能參加工作的，因爲時間的記錄是歷史，正直不阿。你怎樣在今日的時代工作呢？</p>

<h3>沉醉的處所</h3>
<p>— 學禮</p>
<p>沉醉是世間最快樂的事，當我們沉醉在某一處所的時候，渾然忘了宇宙的一切，所謂「三杯無萬事，一醉解千愁」便是描寫這種境界。</p>
<p>我們在沉醉的處所，得到安慰，感到滿足。我們廿願花了重大的代價，換取片刻的沉醉。世問的各人，都有他們各自的沉醉的處所。看到了他們各自的沉醉的處所，可以知道他們的性格，可以推測他們的前途。</p>
<p>最好的沉醉的處所何在？不在舞塲，不在賭窟，而在學術的園林，當數學家在書他們的直錢和圓，化學家在倒他們的硫酸和醇時，他們整個的心靈都沉醉在這裏圓了。</p>
<p>學術的價値，至少從這供人沉醉的一方面看米，已經是無限的了。</p>

<h3>談「三堂會審」</h3>
<p>— 吉</p>
<p>據曹心泉說，「三堂會審」本是小生正工戲，徐小香最喜歡唱這齣戲，譚鑫培還常陪他飾劉秉義，是穿紫官衣，不着藍官衣，現在統稱劉秉義爲「籃袍」，實在是錯誤的。此戲中主角從小生變爲旦角後，纔發現「玉堂春」劇目。一說「玉堂春」的劇目，自始於梆子班，我沒有看過梆子「玉堂春」，但是見過羅小寳小百歲在王瑤卿家裏所攝的「蘇三起解」，那時候羅小寳尙未改老生，蘇三的打扮是靑衣，小脚袴，踹蹺。李丈仁雨曾言，余紫雲的「三堂會審」很出名，「玉堂春」的劇目，自始於紫雲。紫雲扮玉堂春是上蹺的，可見老派「玉堂春」的旦角是都踹蹺的。在二年前平津各報，爲了蘇三應工問題，爭執得好久，一方面說，是應以花旦扮，另一方面的主張是靑衣戲，其實蘇三一角，是　閨門旦應工，和「棒打薄情郞」之金玉奴，「虹霓關」的東方氏，異曲同工。花旦唱，失了她身份；靑衣扮，不合她地位，都不對的。近三十年來，很多內行都當牠是花旦戲，因此哀怨的戲，演出香艷的表情。「玉堂春本是公子他取名」，「十六開懷……王公子，」「在神案底下叙一叙舊情」，「玉堂春好比花中蕊……，」這幾句都是蘇三的傷心史提起此事，眞是「往事不堪回首」，應該如何哀怨悲切，可是今伶唱此，允其是坤旦，沒有個不是怕羞，作嬌，害臊，含笑。在三位大人威風凛凛，嚴刑呼喝之下，戰戰競競求超生之不暇，還怕些什麼羞，作些什麼嬌，何用害臊，怎敢媚笑？這時候的蘇三是以「孤苦」二字來博三位大人同情，並不是想以色相來獻媚的。道種的錯誤，是演員沒有了解所扮脚色的個性。如果能够細嚼玉堂春的身份處境，當然不會有輕顰淺笑的演出了。</p>
<p>老派王景降有念狀，現在除了姜妙香以外，都從略了。劉秉義當年李順亭沈三元也曾穿過紅官衣，不過現在都着藍官衣了。我看過高慶奎，譚小培，馬連良，周信芳，張春彥，鮑吉祥，都很出色。劉景然，雷喜福的潘必正，（程硯秋本是叫周紀良）又可稱絕佳。已故的王榮森，在南方也算是一個善演此脚人材。蘇三不踹蹺，改着彩鞋，將靑衣改爲罪衣罪袴，加束腰裙，據說是王瑤卿第個；學王的是梅蘭芳第一個。以情理而言，蘇「是謀殺親夫的罪犯，有穿罪衣罪袴的必要，同時蘇三有踹蹺的必要，在「看大刑伺候」時，現在都是撓起一隻大脚片，實在是沒有紮蹺好看哩。</p>
<h3>劇藝新聞</h3>
<p>— 覺新</p>
<p>天蟾舞台陳鶴峯雲豔霞演畢十三本金鏢黃天霸，就要脫離。本來天蟾已經邀妥文武老生張韻樓抵他的缺，一方面又向更新舞台商假坤旦毛劍秋，自四月十六日起至五月十一日止短期過班演唱；可是爲了掛牌問題，張韻樓又表示不幹，天蟾當局也不加挽留，經劇務部議決，十四本新戲黃天霸一角，推派高雪樵担任。</p>
<p>共舞台的三集怪俠歐陽德已在前晚戲畢後，開始排練，全體藝員都通宵參加。裏面添入「歌舞上來」塲面，仍聘宣剛担仟敎授。角色方面，趙如泉飾歐陽德一人到底，劉漢臣分飾蘇永祿，蔡慶兩角，王少樓飾前徐勝，後劉德太，李如春飾前高通海，後武杰，至於公演日期，還未確定，但也小遠了。</p>
<h3>洪宣嬌公演前記</h3>
<p>— 魏如晦</p>
<p>太平天的史劇「洪宣嬌」公演了。在「南明史劇」四種寫作的過程中，而有這一劇本的產生，在我自己，完全是意外的事。雖然在戰前也曾想過，以洪官嬌爲中心，寫一部太平天國的戲，但由於歷年搜集的太平天國史料，全部爲翰笙搜取寫「李秀成殉國」，也祗不過僅有一念而已。</p>
<p>這一回，中國旅行劇團假座蘭心大戲院公演，若靑為着希望有一個新的劇本，雷厲風行的來逼我爲她趕寫。我很覺得躊躇。因爲我這幾個月來的興趣中心，完全在「目錄學」方面，而已經答應下沒有寫成的劇本，也還有好幾部未曾交卷。但終經不起她連續的一硬逼」，結果祇得答應下來寫「洪宣嬌」了。</p>
<p>洪宣嬌這個人物，在太平天國的女央雄中，楚最傑出的一個。她富有民族思想，又是英勇的戰將，且擅長醫術，能治傷兵。在政治上，也是個有機智的人物。她的頭腦很淸醒，當她發現秀全一班人腐化，苟安，傾軋，不可與有爲，她就「退處於民居」，「朝臣尼之」亦「不能止」。她的性格又是很果決的。因此，洪宣嬌的生活及其轉變，完全契合了太牛天國的成長與毀滅過程。</p>
<p>太平天國的失敗，不始於到達天京以後。「復明派」領袖洪大全，在湖南被捕遇害，秀全即屠戮軍中「復明黨」，以削弱力量，這是第一個原因。其次，就是到達天京以後，腐化苟安，不思進取。某三，是首事諸王，互相殘殺，國宗權臣，誣陷忠良。經濟制度不能確立，民閒疾苦未先解除，當然更是失敗的基點。他如諸王出身不同，認識各異，國際關係，未能利用，亦影響匪淺。</p>
<p>我是盡可能的，在主綫，在劇情發展中，依據史實，說明了這些因素。我希望能較淸晰的塗抹出一幅太平大國的畫圖。遺憾是：公演日期過於逼近，未能充分壯備，我是僅僅地用了十天時閒，從事於史料閱讀，和劇作寫作。我希望能有機會，重加考訂。</p>
<p>謝謝費穆先生，熱誠的導演。</p>

<p>說罷，向李信微微一笑，把頭倒在李信的懷裏。又說道：「我雖是綠林出身的女兒，却一嚮守身如玉，並非淫賤之輩，你不要輕視我。現在我旣侍奉公子同睡，公子倘然再要見棄時，我也無顏冉活在人世了，願借三尺龍泉，死在公子的身邊吧。」紅娘子說到這裏，剪水雙瞳中早有淚珠兒滴出來。李信聽了紅娘子的話，覺得很是柔順而婉轉，頓悟以前種種的經過都是出於紅娘子的愛心。父見伊一回兒輕顰，一回兒淺笑，雖是個女匪，却柔媚得令人可愛，誰人知道伊是戰塲上的女魔王呢？李信這樣想着，他究竟不是個魯男子，現在他的心漸漸兒有些搖動了。無論什麼央雄豪傑，祇要此心一動，也就拿不定主義而墮其操守了。所以李信本來心如鐵石，經紅娘子這麼一來，自　而然的軟了下去。直至日上三竿，鴛夢方醒。二人披衣下牀，相視一笑。少停李信見了佟天豹，却不覺面上有些愧色。佟天豹見李信業已就範，暗暗佩服他妹子設計之妙，便請李信做二頭領。李信只得答應了。紅娘子自和李信共諧魚水之後，鎭日價廝守在一起，以為得事俊彥，芳心甚樂，過着甜密的光陰。不知不覺已近一月。可是李信失身爲匪，都是受了扛娘子魔力所吸引，雖然在山上夜夜歡娛，在溫柔鄉中度日，而他的心裹不免仍要憶念故鄉，不甘長此埋沒在山林裏頭，因此他的心裏仍要想逃出匪窟，回到杞縣去做一個良民。但紅娘子和他每日寸步不離的守在一塊兒，沒有機會可作出籠之鳥。恰巧有一天佟天豹率領匪衆下山去攻打某處城池，要和李自成的一股流寇合併相通，因此山上很是空虛。（三八）</p>

<h3>Impairment of Territorial and Administrative Integrity: Chinese Government Will Never Recognize It; Foreign Minister Wang Formally Refutes the Soviet-Japanese Declaration; News that the Soviet Union Guarantees its Policy of Aid to China Will Not Change</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement on the 14th regarding the joint Soviet-Japanese declaration: "In the joint declaration issued by the Soviet Union and Japan on the 13th of this month when they signed the Neutrality Pact, it was stated that Japan respects the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the so-called 'Mongolian People's Republic,' and the Soviet Union respects the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the so-called 'Manchukuo Empire.' It goes without saying that the four northeastern provinces and Outer Mongolia are parts of the Republic of China and are Chinese territory. The Chinese government and people will never recognize any agreement between third countries that impairs the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and solemnly declare that the joint declaration announced by the Soviet Union and Japan is absolutely invalid for China." (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to responsible sources obtained by Reuters, the Chinese government, after deliberation at a meeting of various leaders, has telegraphed Moscow, requesting a concrete clarification on certain points of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It is reported that the government wishes to know definitively what the consequences of this pact will be, and what will happen to the Soviet Union's policy towards China. No action will be taken until a reply is received from the Soviet Union. The general population in China is dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's mention of Manchukuo, believing that the Soviet Union's official statement of respecting the territorial integrity and inviolability of Manchukuo is tantamount to recognizing it. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Reliable sources state that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact in order to determine whether it violates Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also wishes to determine whether the Soviet-Japanese Pact explicitly implies Soviet recognition of Manchukuo. If it does, the Chinese government may lodge a protest with the Soviet Union. Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact stipulates: "... shall not take any action or conclude any agreement which could be used by an aggressor to the detriment of the other party." Military observers believe that the new agreement will at most allow the Tokyo General Staff to withdraw four divisions from the nine divisions stationed in Manchuria, as the Japanese would never fully trust the Soviet Union and completely withdraw troops from the Soviet border. The Japanese will use the military force withdrawn from Manchuria when they begin their southward advance, either in the South Seas area or in a large-scale attack on mainland China, hoping to end the war. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Chinese political figures recently revealed that at the same time as the Soviet Union and Japan concluded the Neutrality Pact, Moscow assured China that the Soviet Union's basic policy of assisting China would not be affected by this pact. Foreign Minister Wang also stated that the Soviet-Japanese declaration is not binding on China. Since neither the pact nor the declaration is binding on China, there is no need for China to lodge a protest. Chinese sources also pointed out that Foreign Minister Wang did not comment on the pact itself, and that his remarks were directed only at the joint Soviet-Japanese declaration. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington. A person usually reliable and very well-informed about Soviet activities stated that although the Soviet Union and Japan signed a Neutrality Pact, they have not abandoned their aid to China. Japan had previously insisted that the Soviet Union stop aiding China as a condition for concluding the pact, but the Soviet Union ultimately refused. These people believe that, from the Soviet Union's point of view, continuing to aid China is very important to the Soviet Union. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>New York. The New York Times recently elaborated on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, saying that the conclusion of the pact is actually detrimental to China's position. Although the pact will not immediately divide China into Soviet and Japanese spheres of influence, Japan will be able to act more freely in China as a result. At the same time, this pact will deepen the rift between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party of China, and will force Britain to make every effort to strengthen its strength near Singapore. It also raises the question for the United States of how much naval power it should maintain in the Atlantic and Pacific. On the surface, in a nutshell, this new pact can be said to be a diplomatic victory for Hitler. However, the opposite may be true in reality. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. There are varying views on the significance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. Some people believe that the Soviet Union suspects Germany and wants to obtain Japan's neutrality in preparation for a Soviet-German conflict. Most people believe that the Soviet Union is encouraging Japan to advance southward. In any case, China may not be able to continue to obtain Soviet assistance in the future, but China's determination to fight will not be affected in the slightest. Another group of people even said that Japan may not immediately advance southward, but may withdraw elite troops from Manchuria to China in order to end the China Incident. Xinhua Daily reported this morning on the news of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Pact. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Left Moscow the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Moscow. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka left Moscow yesterday to return home. Before the train left, both Stalin and Molotov went to the station to say goodbye. (TASS, 14th)</p>
<p>Moscow. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka embarked on his return trip to Japan last night. The train he was on was originally scheduled to depart at 5 p.m., but was slightly delayed due to the signing ceremony and morning procedures. Matsuoka stayed here for exactly one week after touring Berlin and Rome. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Local newspapers reported that when Matsuoka shook hands with Molotov at the Moscow station, he said to him, "In any case, please do visit our country." (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Agreement</h3>
<p>Moscow. As a result of negotiations between Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka over the past few days, the Soviet Union and Japan signed a Neutrality Pact yesterday, as well as a declaration on mutual respect for the integrity of the territories and the inviolability of the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchukuo. Stalin and Tatekawa also participated in the negotiations. The contents of the agreement and the declaration are as follows: For the purpose of enhancing the peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and His Majesty the Emperor of Japan have decided to conclude a Neutrality Pact, and have appointed representatives for this purpose: The representative of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs; the representative of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan is Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union Tatekawa. After exchanging credentials, the representatives agreed to the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Contracting Parties guarantee to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with each other, and to mutually respect the integrity and inviolability of each other's territories.</p>
<p>(2) If either of the Contracting Parties becomes the object of attack by one or more third Powers, the other Party shall observe neutrality throughout the entire period of hostilities.</p>
<p>(3) This Agreement shall enter into force from the date of its ratification and shall be valid for five years. If neither of the Contracting Parties announces its intention to terminate the Agreement one year before the expiration date, the Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically extended for five years.</p>
<p>(4) This Agreement shall be ratified as soon as possible, and the exchange of instruments of ratification shall also take place in Tokyo as soon as possible. In witness whereof, the aforementioned representatives have signed this Agreement, in duplicate in Russian and Japanese. Dated this thirteenth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one (that is, the thirteenth day of April, Showa sixteen), at Moscow. Signed by Molotov, Matsuoka, and Tatekawa.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Declaration</h3>
<p>The Governments of the Soviet Union and Japan, in accordance with the spirit of the Neutrality Pact signed on April 13, and for the purpose of ensuring peaceful and friendly relations between the two sides, solemnly declare that the Soviet Union is determined to respect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of Manchukuo, and at the same time Japan is determined to respect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. Signed by Molotov, representative of the Soviet Government; Matsuoka and Tatekawa, representatives of the Japanese Government. Moscow, April 13, 1941. (TASS, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Tokyo is planning to implement the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact as soon as possible. The details of the pact have been sent to the Emperor and Prime Minister Konoe. The Emperor summoned many politicians last night. Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement saying, "I firmly believe that this Soviet-Japanese pact will be the foundation for the rapid resolution of various pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, and will be of great help in promoting world peace. The mutual respect between the two countries for the inviolability and territorial integrity of 'Manchukuo' and the 'Mongolian People's Republic' will ensure the peace and tranquility of the 'Manchu'-Soviet and 'Manchu'-Mongolian borders. Japan initially concluded the Tripartite Pact in order to prevent the spread of war and preserve the peace of Greater East Asia, but the completion of this goal requires a fundamental adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations."

<h3>The Story of Sergeant Fan Wenruo's Loyal and Brave Fighting</h3>
<p>Shaoguan. On March 19, in the battle of Fanchi Ridge, which belongs to Conghua, a Chinese division's XX unit, in coordination with a platoon of infantry, engaged in a day-long fierce battle with more than 600 Japanese troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Sergeant Fan Wenruo led a light machine gun group and flanked the Japanese at the southern end of Qingshan Grand Cave. During the battle, the gunner was seriously wounded by shrapnel, and the reserve gunner and ammunition soldier were also wounded in succession. At that time, the Chinese firepower weakened, and the Japanese took advantage of the situation to attack. At a critical moment, Fan Wenruo acted as the gunner himself and fiercely attacked a charging Japanese soldier. He was then shot in the back, and his ammunition ran out. As the Japanese approached, Fan Wenruo calmly used his bayonet to commit suicide, and everyone who heard about it shed tears. After receiving the report, a deputy commander-in-chief considered the sergeant's loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice to be worthy of commendation, and has submitted a request to the central government for preferential treatment and compensation for his family.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Cause and Effect of the Soviet-Japanese Pact</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has finally returned to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's personal and distant journey was, on the surface, a dedicated courtesy visit to Germany and Italy, but in reality, it was an attempt at a diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union, which he was not at all sure of and absolutely reluctant to talk about. A dedicated courtesy visit is the surface of the surface; and to窥伺 Hitler's true intentions, to investigate the internal situation and strength of Germany and Italy, to assess the trends of victory and defeat in the European war, and to privately calculate how Japan's use of the Tripartite Pact would be relatively harmless, this was his openly secret mission, which is the inside of the surface. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Berlin, he encountered the drastic changes in Yugoslavia, which clearly demonstrated its determination to preserve its autonomy and independence, and refuted the idea that the path to a new order of peace in Europe was not working; upon arriving in Rome, he witnessed the Italian navy's great defeat, which refuted the idea that Italy's "inland lake," the Mediterranean, was still in the old order controlled by others. The obviously thorny relationship with Germany and Italy made Japanese diplomacy appear even more isolated and hesitant, so Matsuoka returned home in despair, with little face to see the elders of Edo. Fortunately, he stayed in Moscow again and signed the Soviet-Japanese pact.</p>
<p>Japan has had its traditional policy towards the Soviet Union for half a century. When the war against China became a heavy burden, and the European war stirred up his ambition to advance southward, the attitude towards the Soviet Union in the past two or three years was artificially ingratiating. Analyzing its illusion, it was to conclude a treaty, adjust national relations, so that the Soviet Union would no longer aid China, and help solve the so-called China Incident; in order to free up the remaining forces and wait for the opportunity to advance southward. This intention has long become a common diagnosis in the world forum. This newspaper has also repeatedly pointed out that although Japan intends to do so, and although there is a possibility of concluding any kind of treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, the Soviet Union will never give up its aid to China in exchange for a piece of paper to Japan. Up to now, the Soviet-Japanese pact has been signed, and the so-called adjustment of national relations may also be based on this, Matsuoka has not made this trip in vain, and may boast loudly, boast of the success of the diplomatic offensive, and triumph with a spring breeze. But what this newspaper has pointed out in the past can now be confirmed to be correct. By examining the clauses of the Soviet-Japanese pact, it can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese translation of the Soviet-Japanese pact, the text of the agreement has four articles and one exchange statement. The first article stipulates that both sides aim at peace and friendship and mutually respect the integrity and inviolability of each other's territories. The second article stipulates that if one of the Soviet and Japanese countries becomes the target of military action by two third countries, the other country should strictly maintain neutrality during the conflict. The third and fourth articles are not of great importance. The exchange statement directly calls this agreement a "neutrality treaty" and involves the Sino-Mongolian border. After this agreement is signed, as long as it is valid for one day in fact, Japan will be free from worries in the north in theory for one day; Japan, which has been mired in a deep abyss for a long time, will feel comforted by the legal freedom from worries in the north; indeed, this is the only comfort that Japan has long yearned for, the highest comfort. Apart from this, the agreement does not give Japan any greater comfort. Not only that. When Japan becomes the target of military action by any country, the Soviet Union has no obligation to remain neutral; in the undeclared war between China and Japan, the Soviet Union is of course not bound by this agreement and has no obligation, that is, it can still continue to advance its consistent policy of aiding China for several years; if the United States or Britain goes to war with Japan, how to interpret the second article of this agreement also retains the possibility of turning against us. Therefore, if Japan intends to solve the so-called China Incident and concludes this treaty, it is really equivalent to picking up the box and leaving the pearl; if it intends to advance southward and concludes this treaty, the actual effect is not yet known, but it has gained a few comforts, which can be regarded as a few encouragements.</p>
<p>Encouragement is just encouragement, and it will not become a factor for Japan to launch a southward advance because of this. The animosity and suspicion between the Soviet Union and Japan is the total accumulation of rights and wrongs, interests and harms, and various spaces and times over the past half century. We dare not boldly believe so deeply that it has been completely offset by a paper document now. But looking at the area where the boundaries of the two sides are adjacent, heavy troops will still be stationed, why is it not still suspicion? What's more, from another cycle to seek, there are other places of mutual generation and mutual restraint: The issue of Japan's southward advance, even if the war against China is not included in the measurement, must first be free from worries in the north, and still wait for the day when Germany wins and Britain loses; the more Germany progresses with military achievements, the more the Soviet Union will strengthen its pressure on Germany: The heavier the Soviet pressure, the more elusive the hope of Germany's victory; the more elusive Germany, the more Japan hesitates. Although the evolution of international forces is not allowed to be fully included in this simple mode, how can we determine the ingenuity of mutual traction? Just like this Soviet-Japanese agreement, it is what Japan has been longing for, but those who promoted the completion of the agreement, instead of saying that Germany has been pulling it together from it, would be better to make the opposite observation, regarding it as Germany's expansion to Eastern Europe, which is not satisfactory to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union began to give Japan a little color in the East in order to deal with Germany in Europe.</p>
<h3>British Comments on Soviet-Japanese Agreement: No Major Changes to the Current Situation; US Officials Express No Surprise; German Eastward Policy Reversed</h3>
<p>London. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that the treaty of friendship and neutrality signed by the Soviet Union and Japan is a novel form of international treaty. In practice, this neutrality treaty is not as extensive as the non-aggression treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, because the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression treaty stipulates that both sides will continue to pursue a friendly policy, even if one party is invaded. The current Soviet-Japanese treaty only stipulates that one party will allow the other to remain neutral when it is the object of military action by a third country. Therefore, in theory, if the Soviet Union is attacked by the Axis powers, Japan's actions will be bound by this treaty. Similarly, if Japan is attacked by any party, the Soviet Union must remain neutral. However, if either party takes the initiative in military action, what attitude should the other party take? This is clearly not expressly stipulated. This omission is definitely not due to negligence, so it is very meaningful, because it leaves an open door to consider various events. Therefore, generally speaking, this agreement cannot be said to have made major changes to the current situation. The recognition of the current situation in Manchuria and Outer Mongolia is only a proof of the already existing situation that has become a fact. As for the issue of Soviet aid to Chongqing, the negotiations have not mentioned a single word in the notification. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington. The State Department did not express surprise or criticize the conclusion of the neutrality treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan. The general impression is that this agreement is equal to nothing, and does not represent a real compromise in which Japan can expand its actions and use its army in other areas. Well-informed sources expressed doubts that this agreement would reduce Soviet aid to China. If it does not reduce aid to China, then it is difficult to understand how this agreement can benefit Japan's position in China. However, Japan's feeling of insecurity about the Manchurian border may be slightly reduced. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington. After the Soviet Union and Japan signed the neutrality treaty, US Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles both went to the State Department to discuss the matter, but they did not want to comment on this new development. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union's signing of this agreement is a major blow to US policy, and that the US Navy's strategic issues and the US-Japan relationship have become more complicated due to the signing of this agreement. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Creates a Threat to Britain and the United States, Gives Japan Freedom to Advance Southward</h3>
<p>New York. Diplomats in Washington yesterday unanimously believed that the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty was a diplomatic reversal for Hitler and his attack on Tatar Neil, and the end of the anti-Soviet line. Berlin and Rome greatly praised the treaty. Many diplomats in Washington believe that this treaty creates a threat to Britain and the United States, because the treaty obviously gives Japan the freedom to extend its power to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Britain's first reaction was that the treaty was not unfavorable to Britain, because the treaty indicated that the Soviet Union should increase its intention to cope with Germany's expansion. German sources in Berlin believe that this treaty is another favorable diplomatic development for the Three Powers. Although there was no comment from official circles, the German official news agency quickly published all the news about the treaty, showing Germany's approval. Italian sources in Rome praised the treaty as a victory for the Three-Power Alliance. It is generally believed that the treaty, regardless of reducing Britain and the United States' hopes for the Soviet Union to join the British and American side, diplomatic observers in London said that the Soviet-Japanese treaty damaged the Axis alliance, because Japan was no longer bound by helping Germany against the Soviet Union. Military observers in London said that it would not be surprising if the troops on both sides of the Siberian border were withdrawn. The greatest interest of observers in Washington is not in the provisions of the treaty, but in the treaty's failure to mention the relationship between Germany or the Tripartite Pact and the Soviet Union's attitude towards China. The United States' interest in the treaty includes its impact on the European war and its possible development in the Far East. This treaty gives the Soviet Union the freedom to oppose Germany's invasion of the Tatar Neil oil field area, because once the Soviet Union is involved in the war in Europe, it can avoid the threat in the Far East. Although observers here dare not predict the extreme development of German-Soviet relations, they said that the development of the new situation will allow Germany to make Washington's diplomatic circles pointed out that the Soviet Union's possible enemies are Germany and Japan, so the treaty actually guarantees Japan's neutrality in the event of a German-Soviet conflict.

<h3>Japanese Naval Minister Claims Readiness for Pacific Crisis</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Naval Minister Oikawa declared that he believed, no matter what situation arises henceforth, the Japanese Navy will never fail to meet expectations. Oikawa stated at the provincial governors' conference held here that, because world powers have been expanding their armaments since last year, Japan will naturally take careful countermeasures. Regarding this point, the Japanese Navy still needs to expand its personnel and equipment. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - It is reported that the full text of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact has arrived in Chongqing this morning. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper headlined this news with prominent characters, stating, "Soviet Union and Japan Reach Compromise." Now that the neutrality of the Soviet Union has been secured, the crisis in the Pacific is even more pressing. Recent Japanese actions, such as the cabinet reshuffle and the division commanders' conference, all suggest that Japan intends to stir up trouble in the Pacific again. The meetings in Manila and Singapore may be aimed at this new development. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Newspapers here today have given prominent coverage to the newly established Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, unanimously welcoming it as beneficial to world peace. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the pact makes the Tripartite Alliance even more powerful. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the pact has dealt a major blow to American Pacific strategy. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the pact can advance Japan's work in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. A Japanese observer stated that the pact sufficiently strengthens Japan's position in resisting Britain, the United States, and China. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Afternoon newspapers here are continuing to publish satisfied comments on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, stating that it is helpful in resolving the China Incident. The newspaper stated that what Japan is most concerned about regarding the crisis in the Pacific is the problem of facing both the United States and the Soviet Union simultaneously. Now that this pact has been signed, Japan can abandon this dual strategy. It also stated that, from today onwards, Japan can concentrate its strength on southward expansion, and this stance of Japan constitutes the most important significance of this pact. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Nye, a spokesperson for the non-interventionist faction in Congress, stated yesterday that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact puts "the United States at a disadvantage." Observers stated that the Soviet-Japanese pact may be an "invitation to war" in the Pacific. (Fourteenth, International News Service dispatch)</p>

<p>London - If the report from Rome that German forces have captured Bardia is confirmed, it means that all the gains made by British forces in their previous conquest of the eastern half of Libya (i.e., Cyrenaica) have been lost. Allied German-Italian forces have now reached the Egyptian border, threatening the Suez Canal. Bardia is only five miles north of the Egyptian border. British forces previously captured it on January 5th with a large-scale land, sea, and air operation. This time, Zhou Xingguo's tanks have entered the city again. In total, the British forces have retreated four hundred miles and are now in a position where they have their backs to the water and cannot retreat any further. The reason for the weakened strength of British forces in Cyrenaica is their deployment to reinforce Greece. Churchill reported in the House of Commons last week that the British General Staff had not anticipated the German offensive in Libya to be so early and so fierce. British forces had planned to retreat to Tobruk to hold a stronger position, but German mechanized forces bypassed it and went straight to Bardia and the Egyptian border. Currently, there may still be isolated British forces trapped in Tobruk. (Fourteenth, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo - Well-informed sources here have revealed the rapid progress of the Libyan front. Fighting is currently taking place near Sollum Port on the Egyptian border. It is reported that on Saturday and Sunday, a mechanized enemy column, bypassing Tobruk (75 miles west of the Libyan border), captured Bardia Port on the Libyan border. Fighting is also taking place in the Tobruk area. It is reported that the British forces in that area are not surrounded nor in danger of being wiped out. A British mechanized column is able to cross the desert and make contact with them. It is reported that the strength of British forces on the western desert front is increasing daily. From this perspective, the situation of British forces is much better than it was a week ago. It has not been disclosed whether British forces are holding the double fortified defensive works built by the Italians in Tobruk. The Germans will probably attack these defenses, which have been repelled by British forces. A large British force is stationed in Tobruk, preventing part of the German force from being redeployed elsewhere. It is widely believed that the German mechanized units' gasoline is transported by aircraft, but the quantity is relatively small. The German rate of advance has probably caused wear and tear on their vehicles, and German casualties in the desert fighting have also been quite heavy. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, it is noteworthy that the Axis powers have not claimed to have captured any enemy soldiers "around Tobruk and during the occupation of Bardia." This is a factor that will determine the outcome of the desert fighting. Only General Wavell knows the exact number of British troops remaining in Tobruk. Summer is approaching, and the heat is unbearable, which those who have not experienced it cannot believe. Moreover, there is no water to be obtained for miles around. Therefore, any general who leads an army to besiege this heavily defended city will not be able to cope easily, while the British forces stationed in the city have ample water and occupy defensive positions built by the Italians. Furthermore, the British control the sea, making it easy to redeploy reinforcements. Therefore, if the Axis forces disregard Tobruk and attack Egypt, their communications will be seriously threatened by Tobruk. General Wavell's plans have not been disclosed, but after British Colonial Secretary Moyne's speech in the House of Lords on Thursday, it is credible that holding Tobruk is part of Wavell's plan. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that throughout Friday night and on Saturday and Sunday, British aircraft widely attacked enemy tank units and other vehicles near Tobruk, inflicting heavy casualties and destroying many vehicles. British fighter planes also strafed enemy motor transport vehicles in the Gazala area, inflicting heavy damage. On Friday night, RAF bombers repeatedly attacked targets in the area and heavily bombed the Gazala airfield. Munitions depots also took hits and exploded. On Friday night, some German planes attacked Malta; one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The area did not suffer major damage, and there were few casualties. In Abyssinia, British aircraft attacked enemy airfields, inflicting heavy damage on several enemy aircraft and motor transport vehicles on the ground. South African fighter planes also attacked an enemy airfield, setting fire to and destroying four enemy aircraft on the ground. Three British aircraft that went out on missions did not return, but the pilots of two were rescued. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Several hundred Chinese employees of the Huazhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, and the Huazhong Apartments (i.e., the Thirteen-Story Building) on Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road) have jointly gone on strike since the 11th due to their demands for increased wages and living allowances not being met, and the issue has not been resolved. It is reported that all Chinese employees of the Duchen Hotel on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road (the Huazhong and Duchen are both Sassoon-owned) have also recently submitted requests to management for a wage increase (because the management rejected it), they went on strike on the morning of the day before yesterday.

As of yesterday, the issue had not been resolved, and labor and management are currently at a standstill.</p>
<p>Box Industry Agrees to Increase Rice Subsidy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Box Industry Labor-Management Cooperation Committee issued a notice on increasing rice subsidies for workers' families: "In view of the fact that workers in our box industry have been facing great difficulties in their livelihoods in recent years due to the impact of high prices, in addition to once increasing wages by 32.5% in March of last year and issuing rice subsidies to workers' families in January of this year, amounting to 20 cents per day for regular workers and 15 cents per day for odd-job workers, in view of the further increase in rice prices, and out of consideration for the workers, it has been decided through labor-management consultation to revise the rice subsidies for workers' families from May 1st of the 30th year of the Republic of China as follows: the daily subsidy for regular workers will be increased from 20 cents to 45 cents, and the daily subsidy for odd-job workers will be increased from 15 cents to 35 cents. The above rice subsidies will be issued at the end of the month together with wages (only those who hold worker certificates issued by the Box Industry Association and the Vocational Association are entitled to the rice subsidy). It has been agreed upon by both labor and management that if rice prices fall back to within 60 yuan after this notice, the rice subsidies set in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China will be restored (i.e., 20 cents per day for regular workers and 15 cents per day for odd-job workers). If rice prices fall back to within 40 yuan, the above rice subsidies will be canceled. If rice prices continue to rise to 150 yuan, the rice subsidy will be further increased (rice prices are calculated based on No. 2 rice). We hope that all workers will work with peace of mind and share the difficulties together. We hope everyone is aware of this."</p>

<h3>German Forces to Attack Allied Forces in Mainland Greece on Several Routes; First Major Battle About to Begin; British Reinforcements Continuously Entering Greece</h3>
<p>London - German forces, which have invaded southern Yugoslavia and Thrace in a sweeping fashion, yesterday divided their forces into five routes to advance towards the Anglo-Greek defensive line spanning mainland Greece. Skirmishes have already begun, serving as a prelude to the first major battle between British and German land forces since the Battle of Dunkirk. The Anglo-Greek defensive line forms a salient, from Dibeli, Florina, Kozani, to Katerini, with the salient point being in the Florina area. According to recent intelligence, German forces have stormed into the Monastir Gap, while another column is advancing northeast from Thessaloniki along the main Thessaloniki route, attempting to converge with the troops storming into the Monastir Gap. It is widely believed that another German attack route is to advance westward from Thessaloniki on the Allied left flank. According to German sources, German forces have made contact with Italian forces in the Topola and Oritda areas. This move will increase pressure on Greek forces in Albania. Most of the military activity of German and Italian forces in Greece yesterday was exploratory warfare to determine the strength of the Greek defensive line. According to news reaching here from the English Channel, Allied forces are still holding their positions on the original line. Athens broadcast yesterday that recent intelligence indicated that the situation on the front line was "most satisfactory." Radio also said that "it is believed that the new Anglo-Greek defensive line is absolutely safe," and that forces in southern Yugoslavia have reached the southern and central mountains of Serbia, "where they will be able to resist for a longer period of time." It was also stated that patrol activities are still continuing in the Monastir area. It is widely believed that neither the Anglo-Greek nor the German forces have launched a large-scale offensive in that area. Authoritative sources here are delighted with the progress of forces in southern Yugoslavia and attribute it to the commander of the southern forces, who is directing them independently. However, people are skeptical that this independent victory will be able to prevent large-scale German action. However, military sources say, "The mountain troops in southern Yugoslavia have gained a favorable position, and the southern forces have proven that they are one of the best soldiers in the world." However, German forces have encountered a new tactic of modern warfare, namely that numerous independent units are launching guerrilla warfare in an organized line and starting to fight Hitler's army in the most advantageous positions. Observers believe that this tactic will make it difficult for the German high command to cope and will hinder its cooperation with Italian forces in fighting the Anglo-Greek forces in Albania.

<h3>Southern Forces Retreat into the Mountains; Plan to Hold Out for the Long Term</h3>
<p>London - According to news here, the situation in the Balkans at the end of the week is slightly more favorable to the Allied forces. British forces in northern Greece engaged in the first major battle with German forces, driving back the German forces, while Serbia is also strengthening its resistance to the strong pressure from the Axis powers. It is reported that a column of German forces driven back by British forces consisted of tanks and infantry. A Berlin dispatch from a Stockholm newspaper on the Balkan situation states that although the Serbian forces have suffered heavy losses, their front line has not been broken. Berlin admits that the difficulties of the Balkan war still need to be overcome. Sources in Budapest claim that Serbian forces have occupied the entire Baranya triangle (formerly Hungarian territory). According to sources in London, German forces in southern Yugoslavia have been driven back to Suharika, and the Serbian forces are advancing towards the Kačamik Gorge and have engaged German armored forces in the village of Topola, 20 miles from Belgrade. The village has now been isolated. Serbian forces in the Kragujevac and Kruševac areas are holding their positions and have overcome Belukopri. According to reliable sources in London, the situation in northwestern Yugoslavia is still confused, but it is known that Serbian forces are currently fighting on both sides of the Morava River. German broadcasts state that Serbian Prime Minister Simović has instructed Serbian military commanders to act on their own initiative, and there are indeed signs that Serbian military commanders are fighting independently, with some having achieved significant victories and leading troops down from the mountains. A Columbia Broadcasting System reporter quoted a spokesperson for the Serbian embassy in Istanbul as saying that most of the Serbian forces have retreated into the mountains without much loss, and that if the military supplies shipped from the Dalmatian coast continue to flow in, they will be able to hold out in the mountains for a long time. A Hungarian spokesman claimed that Hungarian troops advancing towards the southern border have reached Ujvidek, and that paratroopers have occupied important bridges far from the army and are continuing to hold them, awaiting the arrival of mechanized forces. Serbia has destroyed several bridges in an attempt to hinder the Hungarian advance. At the same time, the Serbian city of Sarajevo was also bombed by German forces. The city is the capital of Bosnia, where the assassination of the Archduke of Austria sparked the Great War of 1914. A German news agency claimed that German planes attacked the city, hitting the station and large barracks in the city center, causing a large fire and significant damage.

<p>Athens - According to news received here, the Yugoslav front on the Bulgarian border was broken shortly after the Nazi invasion, due to the concentrated advance of German tanks, but the price paid by the Germans was also very heavy. Judging from the situation, in an area north of the Strumeica Valley, that is, where the borders of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece meet, there seems to be no organized defensive line. The speed of the German advance caught the Serbian forces off guard. Defending the above-mentioned area was a Serbian division that fought bravely in an attempt to contain the advance of the German armored divisions. As for the attacking German forces, 170 tanks broke through along the Strumeica Valley. Two regiments of Serbian forces, carrying anti-tank guns, bravely defended their positions. In the first German attack, 20 tanks were lost, and in the second, 24. However, nine of them broke through the Serbian defenses, and other large numbers of tanks poured in, reaching the Vardar Valley and moving towards Thessaloniki. At the same time, there were German columns that invaded Serbian territory at three locations further north along the Serbian-Bulgarian border. (Fourteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Greek Allied Forces Lose Contact with the South</h3>
<p>London: The isolated Southern Army was still fighting fiercely in the Serbian mountains yesterday. However, since the German forces had broken through the Vardar River basin and the Monastir Anglo-Greek forces, it seemed there was no hope of contacting the Southern Army. After the two areas were defeated, the Greek forces defending the crucial Berahissa defense line were encircled. Military experts here deeply regretted the errors in battlefield communication. It is also believed that Nazi troops broke through the Anglo-Greek lines on several fronts. (Taiwan Public Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to responsible sources, British and Imperial troops continued to arrive in Greece. British infantry repelled an attack by the German Blackshirt "Hitler" division in northern Greece during Easter and inflicted heavy casualties. The German forces are currently testing the strength of the defense lines held by the Imperial troops. According to recent news from the front, all activities are limited to reconnaissance. No major battles have yet occurred between the British and German forces on this front. Athens Radio also stated that the German forces were advancing in Shangmitalo, northern Greece. So far, all battles between the Anglo-Greek forces have been limited to clashes between vanguard motorized units. The British Air Force has bombed several enemy convoys in the Monastir area. It is said that the German side has suffered heavy losses in tanks and troops in the area. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Baranya Triangle Said to Be in Hungarian Hands</h3>
<p>Budapest: The Hungarian General Staff announced yesterday that our troops had recaptured the Baranya Triangle on the evening of the 12th. The entire area is now in our hands. Between the Danube and Tisza rivers, our tank columns reached Neusatz yesterday morning. Our paratroopers are operating behind enemy lines and have been quite successful in capturing bridges and important strongholds to coordinate with our advancing troops. The enemy forces are retreating and destroying bridges along the way to cut off our pursuit. Our losses were minimal. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Italian Mechanized Units Enter Dalmatia</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian troops began invading Dalmatia yesterday and continued to advance to prevent a possible Dunkirk for Yugoslavia. The vanguard troops advancing from Zara, including motorcycle units and light tank units, encountered some resistance, but with the assistance of the air force, they occupied Benkovac, the largest town in Dalmatia, located two thousand kilometers southeast of Zara. At the same time, infantry, artillery, and heavy troops advanced south from Fiume, occupying Signa and Ottovatz between Fiume and Zara. A marine unit besieged islands near Ulcinj. At least six islands along the Yugoslav coast have been occupied by Italian marines. News here says the marines were transported by sturdy speedboats and were equipped with machine guns and hand grenades. (United Press Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>London: It is widely believed that Durazzo, an important seaport on the northern coast of Albania, has been captured by Yugoslav troops. If this is confirmed, it would be a major blow to the Italian forces, as the port has been the main concentration point for Italian troops and supplies since the port of Vlora was repeatedly bombed by British aircraft. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Athens: A communiqué was released here yesterday stating that Royal Air Force bombers successfully attacked German motorized transport units in the Monsti and Florina areas on Saturday. Many vehicles were reportedly destroyed. The communiqué stated that the air force also bombed other locations, but due to poor weather, the results could not be ascertained.

Even if they suffer losses today, they have preserved their future. Now the British Empire is fighting alongside them, and there is a wealthy and inexhaustible democratic nation of the United States as their backing. No matter how difficult the war is, we will surely win. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Domestic Situation in Turkey Is Quite Stable</h3>
<p>Istanbul: Rumors circulated that the Turkish government had declared martial law nationwide, that all transportation had been taken over by the military authorities, and that residents of certain cities had begun to evacuate. Authorities here have denied this, saying that there are no new measures other than the declaration of preparedness last December. The government has decided to establish a "Domestic Propaganda Office" to prevent rumors from spreading. People's minds here have become increasingly stable in recent days, and residents celebrated Easter with great joy. The reasons for this are: first, the Greek forces from Xylomouri on the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea can firmly defend their lines; second, the Yugoslav forces can also bravely fight in the mountainous areas of Herzegovina; third, the Soviet government has sternly condemned Hungary's invasion of Yugoslav territory, proving that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its interests in Southeastern Europe; fourth, the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, hinted that his country does not want to conflict with Turkey, and that there is still a possibility of understanding between the two sides; and fifth, the withdrawal of Bulgarian troops from the Turkish border has eased the situation.

<p>Random Notes on the European War (4)(6)</p>
<h3>A Panoramic View of the United States Navy</h3>
<p>On the USS "Idaho" or any battleship, only the captain or admiral (if present on board to command the fleet) can enjoy private living quarters. Everyone on board, whether sailor or marine, must get used to eating together, dressing together, arranging their hammocks together, and gaming or fighting together. However, although everyone lives together, everything on this warship is cleaner than anywhere else in the world. Naval authorities make each person serving on board, or a group of several people, fully responsible for the arrangement and protection of a designated part of the ship. This method is quite effective because every sailor thinks that the turret, bridge, or the ship's boat used by the captain belongs to him personally. Sometimes the meaning of this ownership even extends to the point where the sailors responsible for these places move their own hammocks to the turret or boat to sleep in.</p>
<p>Discipline is strict on warships, but it seems slightly looser than in the army. All actions on board are based on bugle calls. The rapid wake-up call is blown at 5:30 AM to start everything. The lights-out call is blown at 9 PM to end the day. During the day, sailors scrub the decks, polish all metal objects, practice firing cannons, attend mechanical engineering classes, have dental examinations, get haircuts, eat three nutritious meals, buy ice cream, read newspapers, and write and send letters. Before going to sleep, they even watch a movie or slideshow and sing their favorite familiar tunes and ditties.</p>
<p>Officers on board often play a type of deck tennis for exercise. Sailors do calisthenics every morning at 9:00 AM. Classes are held from 1:15 PM to 2:30 PM to provide recruits with essential training. Some sailors learn how to navigate or manage machinery. Rules of navigation and sailing are included in the study.</p>
<p>The ship's bakery makes 240 large loaves of bread and 190 biscuits every day. The bakers are recruited from the enlisted men and are taught cooking skills by the Navy. Every day, the food eaten by each soldier is tasted by a junior officer to see if it meets the standards. If there is a difference, he will report it to the commanding officer for correction. When the captain eats, he eats alone in a refined cabin. On warships like the USS "Idaho," there is a Filipino servant who is dedicated to serving him. When the captain rests, he is also alone, strolling on the deck.</p>
<p>Cooks must bring coffee pots on deck for inspection every day. Each sailor can drink twelve cups of coffee a day, so the coffee pot is always boiling there, almost without stopping. Ice cream is sold cheaply on board, and the profits are used to purchase movie projectors and various sports equipment.</p>
<p>Whether it is a battleship, cruiser, or destroyer, a movie is shown every night. When warships meet each other at sea, they stop to exchange films.</p>
<p>Haircuts on board cost one and a half U.S. dollars for soldiers and two and a half cents for officers. According to naval regulations, soldiers' hair cannot be allowed to grow beyond two inches. After the soldiers are free, they either read books and newspapers or write letters home. There are special mailboxes on the ship.</p>
<p>During their leisure time, officers can play cards in the lounge or indulge in their own "hobbies" and pass the time as they please. The ship is equipped with a mobile printing press, which is a standard device stipulated by the Navy. It publishes a newspaper on board every day, and the editor is the ship's chaplain.</p>
<p>Senior sailors can sleep on cots, while new recruits sleep in hammocks. Everyone has a locker with military hats, towels, toiletries, and even photos of his loved ones, all stored inside except for thick coats.</p>
<p>(II) A Glimpse of Naval Exercise Warfare</p>
<p>We all know who the United States Navy's hypothetical enemy is during exercise warfare. The following is a report from a news reporter participating in the United States Navy exercise warfare. The "we" mentioned in the text refers to the United States Naval Fleet. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Is Stirring Up Again, with Over 30,000 Bags of Rice Arriving Yesterday, and the Price of Rice Rising by Seven to Eight Yuan in a Single Day</h3>
<p>Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Ming Sang freighter arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 13th), carrying 14,647 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Swire Company's Haikou freighter arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 17,750 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at Swire Dock in the French Concession, beginning unloading this morning. (Reporter Zu)</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, foreign rice saw strong real sales demand from local customers due to the consecutive holidays, while demand from inland and western Shanghai groups was even more voracious. Speculators stirred up trouble, and floating retailers added fuel to the fire, creating a tense and extremely serious situation in the market. Rumors abounded, such as Siam banning exports, Hong Kong banning transportation, and the Japanese army advancing south, all of which were used by those holding goods to raise prices. However, orders from Saigon continued to arrive, occupying an increasingly important position. New transactions included an agreement for 1,000 tons from Saigon in April and May, priced at 136 yuan (some say 135.5 yuan), thrown out by Shenji. In addition, there are two or three other possible agreements. However, the market remains tense. The early market price for No. 1 Saigon reached 119 yuan, No. 2 was 115-116 yuan, No. 2+ was 118 yuan, Fire Mark was 118 yuan, Small Twisted White Body was 116 yuan, Middle Gate was 114-115 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 110 yuan (down to 107 yuan), Broken Tip was 95-96 yuan (down to around 90 yuan), an increase of four to five yuan compared to before the holiday. In the afternoon, buying interest increased further, and the price for No. 1 even saw shouts of 121-122 yuan. Shanghai-British traded April at 137 yuan, No. 2 was currently 138.5 yuan, Mixed Broken was 109.5-110 yuan, and No. 3 Broken Rice was 98 yuan. Small Twisted was currently 139-140 yuan, and shouts were being raised for an increase of two, three, or four yuan in the afternoon. Shanghai-British traded nearly 3,000 tons throughout the day, and there were more than 3,000 bags of current rice.</p>
<p>Due to the multi-day market closure, there were no fewer than one or two hundred loads of thick and thin japonica and other national rice, and the sales side generally saw that foreign rice was so firm and strong, and their appetite increased accordingly. Owners seized this good opportunity, and the intention to sell was even tighter, shouting wildly. However, as a result, although the outlet was good, it was ultimately not as wide as that of foreign rice. The arrival of goods happened to be busy, and it was difficult to compete with foreign rice, with only a 2.5 yuan increase or so. The breakdown is as follows: Changbang Special Japonica Spike was seen at 125 yuan, Kunshan Spike saw Special Japonica at 122 yuan, High at 120 yuan, Secondary down to Middle Gate at 116-117 yuan, Original Package Special Japonica was 130 yuan, and Qingjiao Spike saw Thin Rice at 145 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice always fluctuates with foreign rice, and now is a good time, with both retail and wholesale sales being smooth, and prices rising sharply in tandem, with a huge increase of four or five yuan. Hong Kong Special was priced at 115 yuan, down to 110 yuan, Glutinous was 103 yuan, down to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Increases by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday was the day the Miscellaneous Grains Market reopened after the Spring Festival holiday. Since the financial securities and cotton markets had not yet opened, there were quite a few people from inside and outside the industry present. Real sales and purchases were good. It was heard that the source of Saigon foreign rice was blocked, and the price of rice rose sharply by four yuan, causing panic. Speculators took advantage of this to push up prices, and the market rose by more than one yuan in competition. The breakdown is as follows: Flower Bird Brand Australian Flour was 30.078 yuan, Golden Dragon Brand Canadian Flour was 30.00-30.01 yuan, Steamboat Flour was 30.01 yuan, and more than 20,000 bags were traded. The price of flat-selling flour from Chinese factories was still 25 yuan. It was heard that the factory was about to run out of raw materials and would stop supplying, so the market was quite bullish.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: The wheat market was also quietly firm. The market supply of spot goods has long been exhausted. Occasionally, small amounts of nearby domestic wheat are transported in, and they are all bought by Japanese factories. The selling price is 45-46 yuan. There have been no reports of wholesale transactions.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Bean Oil Rises by Two to Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Cake Market was open as usual after the holiday. There were no special major changes in the overall situation. Although various market prices once soared due to the influence of rumors, both buyers and sellers lacked enthusiasm, so the situation soon returned to a soft trend. However, the environment is still advantageous, and there is still a potential for prosperity. The oil market rose by two to three yuan compared to before the holiday. The transaction volume was 600 barrels of futures Dalian oil, 300 dan of factory oil, and 10 pieces of basket oil. The price of yellow beans rose by about half a yuan, and more than 1,700 bags of each bean were traded. The only tight item was Dutch corn, and Saigon corn was tight first and then tired. A total of 2,500-2,600 bags of spot goods and 300 tons of futures were traded. Bean cake sales were sparse, and although the price rose by two to three cents, it was entirely caused by a game of passing the buck. Today, 1,000 cans of bean oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures Sugar Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was difficult to ease, causing futures to rise again by five cents. The association's negotiated price for the second and fourth grade coarse white spot goods was 89.65 yuan, rising to 89.66 yuan, an increase of two cents. The price for delivery on the 20th of this month ranged from 89.99 yuan to 90.01 yuan, then rose by one cent, returning to 89.7 yuan, an increase of five cents. The price for delivery at the end of the month was 90.45 yuan, 90.50 yuan, 90.70 yuan, 90.90 yuan, 91 yuan, returning to 90.05 yuan, an increase of three cents. Swire's granulated white sugar was relatively cheap, with DY Mark at 85.5 yuan unchanged.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Lead Sheet Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Both the arrival and sales of white lead sheets were sparse, and there was little progress in the trend. However, the standard remained stable despite sharp increases in prices in various shops. It is found that this product is the only raw material for battery factories. Currently, eight or nine battery factories have moved from Shanghai, and white lead sheets are also on the list of prohibited export products and cannot be transported inland, so sales are difficult. In addition, although slight inquiries are seen from the Mujie Printing House and Tea Stack, the total number is not large, and the industry's sentiment is not soft, so the asking price remains firm. Yesterday, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6 were sold for 3,800 yuan per barrel, while No. 8, No. 9, No. 10, No. 12, and No. 14 were priced at 4,500 yuan per barrel.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 150 pieces of old copper were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Cooked Coal Is Available but Has No Market</h3>
<p>Since Indian coal was priced high last month, the coal industry has stopped selling to customers and industry colleagues, resulting in a situation where there is supply but no market. Shops on this street have had to raise prices to search for old stack receipts and carloads on the market, so the dark market has recently been shouting for 400 yuan. The price for storefront customers is 448 yuan per ton for screened lumps, and the retail price is 22 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: National Loan Mosquito Coils, Prices Up 20% Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>Mosquito coils are a necessity for summer. As the weather gradually warms up, factories send products to industry distributors, mostly at market prices, which are up 20% compared to last year. Sales have decreased compared to before, because the occupied areas are restricted by a certain party and mostly sell Dong cargo (猪牌) (Pig Brand), which has caused national mosquito coils to become quite bleak. Current purchase prices are 19 yuan for the Samsung Brand Large, 15.8 yuan for No. 2, 13.9 yuan for No. 3, and 4.8 yuan for loose-packed.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Saturday Holidays in the Banking Industry, Zhang Mengzhao</h3>
<p>Banking Industry: Regarding the issue of Saturday afternoon holidays, I wrote an article in this column (see my previous article "The Inappropriateness of Saturday Holidays in the Banking Industry" last year) because I felt that this measure hindered industry and commerce. Unexpectedly, it aroused a response from the gentlemen working in the banking industry. I don't know what I want to say is that in this extraordinary period, since we don't double our work, we should abide by the established rules and not give up eating because of an occasional accident. We should continue to do business as usual to benefit customers (not a personal problem). It is true that the banking industry has the mission of regulating finance and assisting the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, the banking industry should take full responsibility for the convenience of industrial and commercial exchanges. Try to see how inconvenient the Saturday afternoon holiday is for industry and commerce. In addition, the implementation of the new clock, the collection and settlement of factory, company, and merchant accounts, not only cannot be caught up, but also do less business. Especially for merchants’ business income, it must be at least half a day later before the accumulated huge amount of money can be delivered to the bank's treasury, thus taking on a lot of risks. In addition, the transfer of payment checks between merchants and those who buy and sell goods is also greatly inconvenienced because it is limited to the Saturday afternoon holiday. All kinds of losses (such as the tight time for the transfer of funds and compensation for interest, etc.) are hard to say in one word. As for whether the banking industry itself has difficulties in collecting and settling accounts, it has not been taken into account. I recently read a Chongqing telegram in this newspaper on the 13th, "The banks in our country have always closed on Saturday afternoons to sort out their internal accounts for a week. The Four Joint Offices believe that during this period of resistance construction, banks should increase business hours and improve work efficiency. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided that from the middle of April, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau should all operate as usual on Saturday afternoons, and a letter should be sent to the Ministry of Finance ordering all local banks and commercial banks to do the same." This is indeed the right thing to do. Now, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of the West in Shanghai should follow this rule and no longer hesitate. What will the commercial banks in Shanghai have to say? You don't need to worry about not being able to deposit or withdraw money again, causing trouble until seven or eight o'clock. What's more, there should be no more Saturday afternoon deposits and withdrawals in the future, so all banks should follow the order and resume business on Saturday afternoons immediately. Don't think that you are on an isolated island where government orders cannot reach you and dare to despise them. If you do so, you are simply trying to be selfish, disregarding the public interest, and treating yourself as uncivilized.</p>
<h3>Dry Fruit Preservation from Mold and Insects: Soon to be Stored in Cold Storage</h3>
<p>Among dry fruits, dried longans and dried lychees are the most difficult to preserve. If they retain too much moisture when dried from fresh fruit, they easily mold and spoil. Therefore, regular inspection is necessary, and special care is needed for dried lychees. Even though they are dried with charcoal fire during the initial drying process, their fruit pits often don't dry completely. This can lead to mold or insect infestation due to the moisture in the pits. Varieties like 'Wu Ye Zhi' and 'Lan Zhu Zhi', with their larger pits, are particularly prone to this issue.</p>
<p>Some profit-driven merchants sell newly dried longans and lychees that haven't been sufficiently dried. This is because undried fruits are heavier, leading to higher profits. However, fruits with high moisture content cannot be stored for long. These merchants prioritize immediate gains without considering the interests of buyers. In the past, such practices were rampant during periods of low prices, resulting in significant losses due to mold and weight deductions. After rectification by both vendors and merchants in this city, these practices have gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Currently, with higher prices, this issue is less prevalent. However, there are two periods when this is naturally unavoidable: the yellow plum season. During this time, the fruit becomes damp and prone to mold, insect infestation, and spoilage. Therefore, those holding stock should pre-bake the fruits before these periods to prevent future problems.</p>
<p>Now, scientific methods can be used to overcome this difficulty. During the yellow plum season, the fruits can be stored in cold storage, preventing both mold and insect infestations. As this time approaches, and due to the extraordinarily high cost of labor and charcoal, most of this year's stored longans and lychees will be sent to cold storage facilities for the summer. They will be stored from early May until August or September, when they will be released onto the market.</p>
<p>This cold storage preservation will maintain the fruit's excellent quality and allow it to be sold as new. However, prices will naturally increase due to the high cost of cold storage, which is about five or six yuan per hundred market catties per month. For four or five months, this would amount to twenty or thirty yuan per dan. It is reported that those in the industry are already preparing for this, and soon a large batch of longans and lychees will be sent to cold storage.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Soar, Labor Unrest Rises: Hoarded Rice to be Forcibly Sold: Market Prices Greatly Increased Yesterday: But Reserves are Abundant and Arrivals are Crowded</h3>
<p>Authorities Determined to Punish Strictly Those Spreading Rumors and Abusing Speculation</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that, according to reliable Chinese sources this morning (the 14th), the Shanghai Municipal Council will soon implement special measures to force hoarders to sell their stockpiled rice. The details of these measures are not yet known, as today is a holiday and it is impossible to inquire and confirm with the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Since the abolition of price controls, rice prices in this city have been unstoppable. Yesterday was the first market day after the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday. Under the rampant rumors spread by speculators, the price of each shi of domestic rice soared by as much as four or five yuan. If the authorities of the two concessions do not decisively take strict measures, the future of food for the citizens of this city is extremely concerning. Moreover, the recent labor unrest is all fueled by the high rice prices, which is a serious matter related to public safety. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Speculative Tricks</p>
<p>The reason for yesterday's rise in rice prices is that, after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, general speculators feared the imminent southward advance of Japan and rushed to buy spot goods on the market. Hoarders with large quantities of spot goods further raised prices, causing market prices to rise higher and higher. Saigon No. 1 rice rose from 114 yuan to 119 yuan per shi. These illegal elements seize upon slight changes in the situation and apply their usual speculative tricks to satisfy their selfish desires. According to an expert, although the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact will change the situation in the Far East, this needs to be seen in light of England and Germany having issues in the Balkans. Speculators used this as an excuse to raise rice prices, which is absurd.</p>
<p>Should Prohibit Rushing Purchases</p>
<p>According to a normal rice merchant, this city has sufficient rice reserves, enough to supply more than five months of needs, and the source is very smooth. Although the situation in the Pacific may change, there is no need to worry about food for the citizens of this city. Yesterday, the total number of bags of foreign rice shipped to this city reached more than 40,000. The arrival of domestic rice also increased sharply yesterday. Moreover, the orders for foreign rice in April also reached more than 400,000 bags. Therefore, if the authorities can stop speculators from rushing to buy spot goods on the market, and implement the rules of retail sales and sales between firms, then speculators will not be able to be so rampant in spreading unfounded rumors on the market.</p>
<p>Punishment Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>It is also learned that although price controls on rice in this city have been abolished, the authorities of the two concessions will still punish those who hoard and manipulate prices in accordance with the hoarding and speculation laws promulgated by the National Government in the extraordinary period. "Those who are not engaged in this industry but hoard goods exceeding a certain quantity, and those who are engaged in this industry and hoard goods with the behavior of profiteering and manipulating, shall be severely punished."</p>
<h3>One Hundred Yuan Notes with Altered Place Names: Prohibited from Use</h3>
<p>In order to prevent capital flight, the National Government has repeatedly issued orders to prohibit the outflow of capital. However, some people, blinded by greed, regard government orders as mere formalities and smuggle hundred-yuan notes printed with Chongqing place names from the capital to Shanghai for profit. The exchange rate for every ten thousand yuan is more than three thousand yuan. Therefore, the authorities have ordered that hundred-yuan notes printed with Chongqing names and folded with creases are refused for use. At the same time, they encourage the transfer of funds to the interior. Therefore, those who remit these banknotes to the inland will be exceptionally received. After the implementation of this measure, Shanghai place names were added to the Chongqing place names, hoping to mix them in the market. Therefore, the Central Bank authorities have issued a public notice stating that this type of hundred-yuan note with the added place name is also prohibited from use. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention to avoid losses and being taken advantage of by criminals.</p>
<h3>Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory: Shareholders' Meeting Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory has been around for seventeen years. The various new drugs it manufactures, such as Xiaozhilong, are comparable to those produced in Europe and America. In addition, it has also set up a glass instrument factory, a serum vaccine factory, and a rubber factory. At the same time, it is entrusted by the American Mallinckrodt Chemical Pharmaceutical Company and the British Pharmaceutical Company to sell various experimental and analytical reagents. Under the leadership of General Manager Bao, the factory's business is thriving, and its capital has increased to several million yuan. It is reported that the factory is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting today to discuss issues such as issuing new shares and developing business.</p>
<h3>Public Concession: Strict Security, Major Crimes Decreasing</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, there were 371 crime cases in the Public Concession in the past week. Ordinary robbery and pickpocketing cases have increased compared to the past, but all others have decreased. A total of 477 criminals were arrested, a decrease of 122 compared to the previous week. Among them, 125 had criminal records. Now, in order to maintain good public order in the concession, the security arrangements will continue to be carried out.</p>
<h3>French Concession Territory: Japanese Arrest Four People in a Row: Principal, Teacher, Male Lawyer, Female Lawyer, All Now Detained by the Japanese Military Police, Reason Unknown</h3>
<p>In the past three days, the Japanese, together with the French Concession police, have successively arrested Zhu Lin, former principal of Wu Lun Girls' High School, Tong Muge, teacher of Minli Girls' High School, and lawyers Yao Yunbo and Zhang Hongwei, and taken them to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Principal and Lawyer</p>
<p>At around 7:00 AM on the 12th of this month, five plainclothes Japanese military police officers drove to the French General Patrol Room in Lujiawan and requested assistance to arrest Zhu Lin (from Hankou), former principal of Wu Lun Girls' High School, at No. 29 Yuancheng Lane, Lafayette Road. The French patrol room sent personnel to assist in the arrest and handed her over to the Japanese. Then, at around 6:00 AM on the 13th, the Japanese plainclothes military police went to the French patrol room again and requested the arrest of lawyer Yao Yunbo (zi Xiangjiu) from Yixing. They went to No. 6 Dahengfang, No. 68 Ximen Road, and arrested Yao.</p>
<p>Continued Arrest of Two People</p>
<p>After Zhu and Yao were arrested, yesterday (the 14th), at around 6:00 AM, the Japanese plainclothes military police took them to the French patrol room and requested that Chinese and Western detectives assist in arresting Tong Muge (from Chongming), a geography teacher at Minli Girls' High School, No. 612 Lafayette Road. Tong is the cousin of Tong Hangbai, the former principal of the school. Because Tong did not live in the school, they went to Tong's residence at a certain number on Saporos Road and arrested Tong. At the same time, they went to No. 25 Tiancheng Lane, No. 155 Xuehuali Road, and arrested female lawyer Zhang Hongwei (from Dongyang, Zhejiang), who joined the Lawyers Association as a member in August 1938. When Zhang was arrested, the Japanese took a photo of her husband placed on the table.</p>
<p>Contact Telephone</p>
<p>It is reported that the four people arrested by the Japanese are currently detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. Yesterday, after Tong and Zhang were arrested, their families received a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, saying that they were both detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and would be released after interrogation, and told the families not to panic. When the Japanese went to arrest Zhang, No. 26 Tiancheng Lane mistakenly thought that there was a robbery next door and urgently telegraphed the patrol room to report it. The patrol officers rushed to the scene and realized it was a misunderstanding, and then returned. As for why the Japanese arrested them, it is not known.</p>
<h3>Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers: Announced to be Held as Scheduled: Taxpayers' Association Formally Notified About Proposed Changes to the Shanghai Municipal Council Organization</h3>
<p>According to the official announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, the special meeting and annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession will be held at 2:30 PM on the 17th at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. It also stated that the admission tickets for the meeting have been mailed to qualified taxpayers in the concession. The Japanese are handed over to the Japanese Taxpayers Association for distribution. The association has stipulated that the procedures for collecting them will be handled at the Japanese Club from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day from the 14th to the 16th. It is heard that the important agenda item of this special meeting is the proposal to change the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council and form a temporary board of directors, proposed by the current Chairman of the Board, Keswick, and Japanese Director Okamoto. This case is of great importance to the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States. Whether British and American taxpayers agree to change the status quo, and whether the Chinese side agrees to change the number of Chinese members and elect new candidates, are all issues of great concern.</p>
<p>Formally Notifying the Chinese Taxpayers</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's change of organization and the proposal to form a temporary board of directors, the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that it will be submitted for discussion at the special meeting of taxpayers to be convened on the 17th. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council has officially informed the Chinese Taxpayers' Association by letter from Chairman Keswick. After receiving the letter, the association, with the chairman in Hong Kong, has sent the original letter to Hong Kong and is waiting for a decision.</p>
<p>Foreigners Launch Campaign to Participate in the Special Meeting</p>
<p>The special meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held at the Race Club on April 17th at 2:30 PM. The important agenda items are to elect the chairman and secretary of the meeting, pass amendments to the land regulations, and reorganize the board of directors. Taxpayers from various countries believe that the holding of the special meeting is of great importance to their own interests, and that the amendment of the land regulations and the reorganization of the board of directors will have an even greater impact. Therefore, community groups from various countries have been actively mobilizing taxpayers to participate in recent days. It is expected that more than 400 people will attend at that time, and the number of eligible votes may reach around 15,000. The meeting will begin at 2:30 PM. Judging from the preparations and arrangements, it will definitely be held smoothly. The amendment of the land regulations and the organization of the temporary board of directors can be approved by the majority without debate. The meeting is expected to end at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>The Chairman Will Make an Important Report</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held after the special meeting of taxpayers. It will be chaired by Heilmck, the judge of the American Consulate, and the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, Bester, will serve as the secretary. The important agenda items include electing Western land committee members and public hospital directors for the next year, passing the Shanghai Municipal Council's report and accounts for 1940, the budget for 1941, and the report of the Control Committee. Chairman Keswick, Vice Chairman Mitchell, and other American and Japanese directors will all attend. At that time, Chairman Keswick will make an important speech, reporting on the administration over the past year and all the difficulties encountered. It is believed that the importance of this annual meeting, held after the special meeting, will be greatly reduced. All agenda items are expected to proceed smoothly without debate.</p>
<p>The Inauguration Date of the New Directors Remains the Same</p>
<p>As for the inauguration date of the next term of temporary directors, according to Article 21 of the Land Regulations, "The elected directors shall take office after the accounts of the outgoing directors have been audited and approved by the annual meeting in accordance with Articles 9 and 12 of these regulations." Therefore, the sixteen new directors can officially take office on the 18th of this month (the day after the annual meeting). As for the date of their meeting, they should convene for the first time at 4:00 PM next Wednesday (the regular meeting date). At the first meeting, they should elect one chairman and one vice-chairman. As for the candidates for chairman and vice-chairman, the competition between countries will be fierce, and the British and American directors are likely to have the highest voice.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection of Ships</h3>
<p>According to the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, at a reception for Western reporters in this city yesterday, the Japanese Navy's "blockade patrol team" in North China inspected 663 ships in the North China Sea last week, and 17,000 ships in the Huangpu River. They also removed three water mines in the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Aigao Escorted to Saigon: Not Yet Formally Indicted: It is Difficult to Predict What Kind of Interrogation He Will Undergo: Thorough Investigation Required Before Trial</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, Aigao, the leader of the Free French movement in Shanghai, has been detained on the French gunboat *Cogna* by the French naval authorities here since the 5th of this month. Until 4:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), he was escorted onto the French postal ship *Gindiah* to be tried in Saigon. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the French authorities summoned Aigao's wife and his lawyer, Plume, to the *Cogna*, informing them that Aigao would be leaving Shanghai for Vietnam in a few hours. Half an hour before the *Gindiah* weighed anchor, Aigao was escorted into a small boat and transferred to the *Gindiah*, without allowing Aigao's relatives to board the ship to say goodbye to their loved one.</p>
<p>Another Lawyer Appointed to Defend</p>
<p>Lawyer Plume claimed this morning that he could not go to Vietnam to defend Aigao, but a lawyer in Saigon would fight for Aigao's freedom. It is not yet known whether Aigao will be interrogated by a naval court in Vietnam. The French authorities here said they did not know what kind of interrogation Aigao would undergo after arriving in Vietnam. The headquarters of the Free French movement in this city recently received a telegram from Baron, the Far East representative of General Tegol, criticizing the French Consul in Shanghai, Majeret, for arresting Aigao.</p>
<p>Sudden Escort Surprising</p>
<p>Plume declared yesterday that he would remain in Shanghai unless necessary after Aigao was escorted to Saigon, but he had appointed lawyer Malpom in Saigon to handle the matter. He was shocked by Aigao's sudden escort, and even Aigao himself was quite surprised. He continued that the investigation before the trial would take a long time, perhaps even a year. He said that the facts of the case must be collected in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Free Elements Indignant</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that Aigao, the leader of the Tegol movement in this city, was transferred to the French postal ship *Gindiah* yesterday (the 13th) and sailed from Shanghai to Saigon at 5:00 PM. Aigao's defense lawyer said that the French naval authorities have not yet filed a public indictment against Aigao, so the defense statement has not been prepared. When asked if he would go to Saigon to defend his client, he said that this issue had not been discussed, but he might go to Saigon. Although Aigao has not been formally indicted, officials claim that he has induced French naval soldiers to join the Tegol army. However, people who know Aigao deny this, saying that although Aigao is a patriotic activist, he has no ability to induce French naval soldiers to abandon their posts and abscond. The authorities did not issue a formal arrest warrant before Aigao's arrest, which has caused indignation among free movement elements and other foreigners here.</p>
<h3>Capsized Sailing Ship at Jinshanwei: Investigating the Truth: Families of the Victims Can Claim the Bodies: Route to Get There Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>On the 9th of this month, more than 200 Ningbo-Shaoxing passengers traveled from Andong across Hangzhou Bay to Zhapu, and then to Shanghai. Because the boat was small and there were too many people, the whole boat capsized when it was nine miles away from Jinshanwei. It is now learned that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association received a letter from Li Shanming of Jinshanwei and specially sent Shao Xiangqing and Gu Xunzhai of the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Association to go to the scene of the accident to investigate the truth and discuss the follow-up matters. Families of the victims can go to Jinshanwei to claim the bodies. The route from Shanghai to the scene is now reported as follows: Take the No. 2 bus from Edward Road to Hongqiao Road, then hire a rickshaw (the fare is three corners) to the bus station, cross the barbed wire, then take the Minhang long-distance bus (the fare is about one yuan and five corners) to Minhang, walk to the river mouth, cross the river, take the Jinshanwei long-distance bus (the fare is about two yuan and eight corners) and go straight to Jinshanwei Zhong Street.

<h3>Shen Liwei Narrowly Escapes Being Shot in Front of Jingtu Convent on Guling Road: Someone Attempted to Assassinate Him When Leaving the Convent After Attending a Funeral: Two Shots Fired, Missed, and the Assailant Escaped</h3>
<p>Huaguang News Agency reports that Wu and Shanghai gentry Shen Lianfang have long been engaged in the silk industry and can be called leaders in the industry. He is particularly enthusiastic about charity. Recently, due to his old age, he has retired and lives in Shanghai, living as a recluse. His eldest son, Liwei (about 40 years old), is also engaged in the silk industry, but in recent years, the silk industry has gradually declined, so Shen Liwei is seeking other advancements. It is reported that he has recently taken a new position and has a private car. Yesterday at noon, Shen Liwei had a funeral notice from the father of a Wang, manager of the Hengfeng Real Estate Company at 542 Beijing Road. Shen went to pay his respects with a nephew, wearing a blue robe and a black jacket, and had a meal at the company. At about 2:00 PM, the banquet was over, and he was about to step into his private car when two men in blue cloth short shirts and trousers suddenly emerged from the roadside. One of them pulled out a pistol and tried to fire at Shen Liwei. His nephew, who was next to him, saw that things were not good and bravely stepped forward to grab the man's gun-holding hand. The man was anxious and fired two shots at Shen's nephew, both of which hit the hem of his long robe, leaving two holes. Fortunately, he was not injured. The nephew was anxious and let go. The gunman and his companion took the opportunity to escape. At that time, Shen had turned around and ran into the Jingtu Chan Monastery, and immediately reported the incident to the Xinza Patrol Station by telephone. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene to investigate, but the gunman had already fled far away. The police are now ordered to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Mao Sheng Foreign Firm Sues Ruifeng Case: American Court Does Not Accept</h3>

It is generally expected that the case will be settled out of court.

This copper ingot was stolen by a Swiss expatriate named Huerte.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Promote: Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign: Free X-Ray Examinations Will Be Held in All Hospitals in Shanghai Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The tuberculosis prevention campaign jointly launched by leaders from all sectors of the city and the New Medicine Industry held a reception for all sectors at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 3:00 PM the other day. Dozens of people, including presidents of hospitals and guests from all sectors, including Chang Wenlan, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, and Ding Fubao, attended.</p>
<p>Establish a Foundation, Promote the Country</p>
<p>First, General Secretary Ding Huikang delivered a speech, saying that the greatest significance of the tuberculosis prevention campaign is to eliminate the sick men of East Asia and revive national health. This great work depends on the supervision and promotion of the masses, so that a foundation can be laid, and only then can the day of real success be achieved, and the foundation for national revival also lies here.</p>
<p>Be Aware First, Work Hard to Promote</p>
<p>Then, President Xu gave a speech, saying that the seriousness of the tuberculosis problem in our country is due to the lack of tuberculosis knowledge in society. In addition to the actual work of this session, we especially hope that people from all walks of life who are aware of this will work hard to promote, so that everyone has a deep understanding of tuberculosis prevention, so that the spread of tuberculosis can be gradually reduced, and this tuberculosis prevention campaign can be spread to all parts of the country, which is really the industry of public welfare in the country.</p>
<p>Spitting at Will, Prohibition Should Be Implemented</p>
<p>Lawyer Li Baolin said that a magazine contained an article "A Glimpse of New York", which stated that there were notices in the subway in the United States prohibiting spitting at will, and those who violated it would be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years. Even with the high level of knowledge of the American people, there are still such harsh laws. The general public in our country has the habit of spitting at will, and the danger of spreading germs in the sputum is even greater than that of bombs. For the sake of public safety, it is necessary to promulgate appropriate prohibitions. This is a very important issue in tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<p>Free Check-ups at Major Hospitals</p>
<p>It is now reported that the campaign will be jointly held by major hospitals throughout Shanghai starting tomorrow, offering free X-ray check-ups. At the same time, major pharmacies have designated preferential measures for patients, which is really good news for the city's civilians.</p>
<h3>Young Bandit Zhang Rongfu Robs a Leather Suitcase on the Road, Shot Down and Captured by Patrol</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongfu, a native of Ningbo, is 17 years old and was an apprentice in the Huafeng Printing Factory in Hongkou. A month ago, Zhang Rongfu resigned from his job at the printing factory because his income was too low to maintain his livelihood, and made a living by robbery. Yesterday at about 5:00 PM, a Japanese woman was holding a leather suitcase wrapped in newspaper and walking from east to west along the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road. Zhang Rongfu followed behind her and took the opportunity to rob the suitcase and flee. The Japanese woman spoke Chinese and shouted for the arrest of the thief. A Chinese patrolman, No. 1706, nearby heard the noise and rushed to arrest him. Seeing that the bandit was about to escape into Hongmiao Lane, the Chinese patrolman drew his pistol and fired a shot, hitting the bandit's right leg. The bullet went through, and he fell to the ground wounded and was captured. At that time, Zhang Yougen, a 17-year-old apprentice at the Gedexing Woodworking Shop in Hongmiao Lane, who was wiping tables and chairs outside the shop, was also seriously injured in the right foot by a stray bullet. Later, the Chinese patrolman called a car to send Zhang Yougen to Tongren Hospital for treatment, while Zhang Rongfu was sent to the patrolman hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>The Gospel of the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>— Qing Ping</p>
<p>A Visit to the Chinese Health Association</p>
<p>Progressive medical professionals, sympathizing with the poor and sick, have created medical organizations and health institutions for the sake of human health, which are emerging with considerable momentum. The Chinese Health Association is one of the most well-managed and diligent of these organizations. They truly serve society, relieve the suffering of patients, and promote public health knowledge as their duty. The doctors are all very experienced and dedicated experts. This prompted me to visit them.</p>
<p>On a Thursday afternoon, I invited Mr. Huang and his brothers, Jiade and Jiayin, from the Xifeng News Agency to accompany me on a visit. The Chinese Health Association is located at 41 Chih Ham Road, right at the intersection of Avenue Road, making transportation quite convenient. This building was built by the Chinese Medical Association. The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association are essentially two sides of the same coin. The Chinese Medical Association is academic, with the aim of improving medical endeavors and promoting health education. The Chinese Health Association is technical, handling health affairs, directly serving patients, and promoting human health. This building is not a tall Western-style mansion. Observing its exterior, one would be surprised and disbelieve that it is a treasure trove of the nation's medical community and the site of doctors treating patients with such urgency. We saw a wealth of ancient medical literature and medical journals from various countries (this will be discussed separately).</p>
<p>In a simply furnished reception room, we met Dr. Ouyang Zhong, the Director-General of the Chinese Health Association; Mr. Wang Jimin, a senior figure in the medical community, who is the medical affairs secretary of the Chinese Medical Association, president of the Chinese Medical History Association, and professor at the National Medical College; Dr. Yu Xinen, who recently returned from his studies last year. Dr. Yu has profound research on pulmonary tuberculosis and is currently the editor of the Chinese Health Magazine; and Miss He Zhuxuan, the head of the membership group of the Chinese Health Association and head of the public experimental area nurse department. They told me about the organization, work, and facilities of the Chinese Health Association.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese Health Association was officially established in Shanghai only on July 1st of last year, in terms of actual work, it already has several years of history. This organization is composed of doctors enthusiastic about social welfare, public health experts, and Minghui workers. Many important medical groups and health institutions, such as the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association, the Chinese Venereal Disease Prevention Association, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the Shanghai Birth Control Research Society, the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the Chinese Women's Association, the Chinese Dental Association, the Red Cross, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Science Society, etc., all have representatives participating. It includes many units and can actually be said to be a joint organization of the above groups.</p>
<p>The current directors of the association are: President Dr. Zhu Heng (Acting President of Shanghai Medical College), Vice President Dr. Diao Xinde (President of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association), Treasurer Dr. Fu Wenshou (President of the Nutritional Promotion Association), Secretary Shi Siming (Director-General of the Chinese Medical Association), Dr. Hai Shende (President of Shanghai Lung Hospital), Dr. Wang Shuzhen (President of Shanghai Ximen Women and Children's Hospital), Shen Jiying (Secretary of the Shanghai Birth Control Guidance Center), Zhou Chenghu (Director of Ophthalmology at Shanghai Medical College), Zheng Quan, Dentist (President of the Chinese Dental Association). In addition, the executive staff are: Director of the Propaganda Group Dr. Huang Huiguang (Physician for Women and Children's Health at the Clinic), Head of the Membership Group Miss He Zhuxuan (Head Public Health Nurse), Director of the Public Health Experimental Area Dr. Huang Huaixin, Director-General Dr. Ouyang Zhong (Physician of the General Medicine and Leprosy Department of the Clinic).</p>
<p>The mission of the Chinese Health Association is "to make the public feel the importance of health, and to make China a first-class country in terms of health and physique." The association's current main work is concentrated in the Xin Zha Public Health Experimental Area. This experimental area has already achieved excellent results under the leadership of the Chinese Medical Association in the past few years. Their work can be divided into two parts: one is the establishment of clinics, and the second is the nurse training and service of the public health nurse department; the two parts work closely together to achieve the greatest effect. The clinic is divided into nine departments: tuberculosis, ophthalmology, venereal diseases, maternal and child health, birth control, dentistry, and general medicine. Each department is headed by specialized physicians with profound medical knowledge and a spirit of service. The area of this Xin Zha Experimental Area is bounded by Avenue Road to the north, Suzhou Creek to the south, Chengdu Road to the west, and Carter Road to the east. At least 80 percent of the residents in this area are poor people; it is actually a slum, so their health is a problem and they cannot afford treatment when they get sick. Therefore, it is very meaningful that the Chinese Health Association has chosen this area as an experimental area. So these clinics are aimed at people in the middle and lower classes. Consultation fees and medical expenses are very low; the initial consultation requires a registration fee of one dime, and follow-up consultations are five cents each. If they are indeed extremely poor and unable to pay, they can receive free treatment, and even medicines are given away for free. Their main purpose is to indicate and teach the importance of disease prevention. In addition to providing necessary treatment to those who come for treatment, doctors or nurses also tell them the prevention methods for various diseases and general health knowledge, and nurses are sent to visit patients' homes to provide appropriate help and advice.</p>
<p>The work of the Public Health Nurse Department is divided into the outpatient department and the home visit department, which is headed by Miss He Zhuxuan, who is smart, capable, and experienced. Miss He has several virtues such as a strong physique, gentle temperament, and enthusiasm for service, which are suitable for her to undertake this arduous and difficult work. There are currently eight nurses. These young ladies are all graduates of nursing schools and have undergone special training. Everyone embraces the spirit of obedience and sacrifice and works hard. Therefore, although the number of people is small, they have made many commendable achievements. In addition to assisting in the diagnostic work and various examinations in the outpatient department, their most important work is health education. In this regard, they: hold lectures for waiting patients on various health knowledge and the importance and methods of disease prevention; conduct individual talks with patients to investigate social and health issues related to them and help them solve various difficulties; instill family health and maternal and child health knowledge in women seeking treatment; organize children's associations. The participants are all schoolchildren in the area who have no opportunity to attend school. They teach health knowledge and train hygienic habits, and also teach them to sing, arithmetic, literacy, and writing, so that these unfortunate children also have the opportunity to experience the life of kindergarten and elementary school. At ordinary times, nurses make home visits at any time to urge these children to practice hygienic habits.</p>
<p>Although the work of the Chinese Health Association focuses on this experimental area, in fact, they are not limited to this scope. If poor people outside the area need medical and health assistance, the staff in the area are also treated equally and are happy to serve. They treat these poor people, and not only do they not charge the patients expensive consultation fees, but they also have to assist the Public Works Bureau's health department in discovering people with leprosy and forcibly send them to the leprosy clinic affiliated with the Health Association's expanded clinic for diagnosis and treatment, because currently Shanghai only has this one clinic specializing in leprosy. In this situation, the concession authorities seem to should provide them with a large amount of funding, but in fact the Public Works Bureau only subsidizes them with 500 yuan per year. The leaders of the Health Association have repeatedly asked the Public Works Bureau to increase the subsidy, but the result is that the Public Works Bureau is financially exhausted and has no effect. Therefore, although the Chinese Health Association undertakes social work for national health, their funding is very tight. In the past, they relied on donations from local public groups and individuals. Currently, due to the war, the source of funding is gradually decreasing. It is said that Mr. Feng Bingnan and others, who are enthusiastic about social welfare, are trying to raise funds for them. The association itself is also actively recruiting members in order to strengthen its foundation and develop its work. In fact, it only charges each member an annual membership fee of two yuan, and the benefits it gives to each member include: receiving a health badge, receiving a health record, receiving a free subscription to the Chinese Health Magazine for the whole year, free physical examinations, free vaccinations, and free vaccinations, which are several times the membership fee paid. I think people in the community will be happy to support and actively participate. (End)</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun's Residence Suddenly Visited by a Strange Guest Xiang Was Not Home and No Accident Occurred More Guards to Protect Court Personnel</h3>
<p>Xiang Zhejun, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, lives at No. 48, Lane 445, 　　　Metcalfe Road. His residence is guarded by two Chinese detectives dispatched by the Public Works Bureau Police Department. Since Yu Hua, the criminal court president of the Second Branch of the High Court, and Qian Hongye, the criminal court president of the First Special Court, were assassinated one after another, and Xu Weizhen, the president of the Second Branch of the High Court, was kidnapped recently, Xiang has moved to the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, where more detectives dispatched by the police station guard him day and night.</p>
<p>Attending for Protection</p>
<p>His residence is still guarded by detectives dispatched by the Gordon Road police station. However, at about 12 o'clock late the day before, five strong men in Zhongshan suits suddenly arrived in a car and sped to the entrance of Lane 445 on Metcalfe Road and got out of the car. Two of them each took out a box cannon and intimidated the gatekeeper No. 2548, seized his weapon, and monitored him. Then they went to the back door of No. 48, first telling the two Chinese detectives No. 296 and No. 420 who were stationed to guard them, and took away two rows of bullets from their pistols, and then entered the house and searched it. Their purpose was because it was a weekday last night, Xiang would definitely go home to live, so</p>
<p>Planning to Kidnap</p>
<p>However, Xiang did not go home that day and still lived in the court. Therefore, after searching the house, they did not find Xiang's whereabouts. They took the seized bullets and other items and fled without a trace in the original car. After the detectives reported to the Gordon Road police station, they immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to investigate. Afterwards, the police station authorities, in addition to ordering all police stations to be vigilant, also dispatched more detectives to strictly protect Xiang and other important court personnel to avoid a recurrence of the same incident.</p>

<h3>Dr. Wei Dan's Great Success in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Wei Dan's newly invented method of nasal tip contact therapy has been very effective since the consultation. The first day of consultation was very enthusiastic, and in these ten days, there was a steady stream of people, with the势 to be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been treated by the doctor for the first time feels that the effect of this new method is miraculous and can bring back the dead. In this week, especially those suffering from asthma, the effect is even faster. Every time someone has suffered from this disease for many years, the disease disappears after the first operation, which is even more amazing.</p>
<p>As for rheumatism, bone pain, stomach disease, and neurasthenia, there are many people who have been cured by the doctor. There are also those who have been depressed and rejuvenated after treatment. There are also children with delayed development, dull intelligence, and nervous sensitivity who have also been cured. From this point of view, the doctor's new treatment method, although very simple, has remarkable effects, and everyone thinks that Bian Que is reborn. According to Dr. Wei Dan's new method, a small metal rod is used to contact the nerve points of the mucous membrane in the nose. The patient does not feel any pain, but the face is rosy, the eyes are moist, and occasionally sneezing indicates that the patient has a good response to the treatment. Dr. Wei Dan has restored the normal function of the patient's sympathetic major nerve.</p>
<p>Dr. Wei Dan has only opened a clinic in Shanghai for a short time, but this miraculous effect is not accidental, but because Dr. Wei Dan had already seen the effect when he opened a sympathetic major nerve sanatorium in Paris. Based on the results obtained from 10,000 consultations, there is the following table A</p>
<p>Asthma 88% Irritability and Fainting 79% Insomnia 84% Neurasthenia 82% Headache 80% Nerve Sensitivity 78% Stomach Disease 90% Rheumatism 77% Neuralgia 81% Nervous Tension 78% Throat Symptoms 60% Bronchitis 90% Dysentery 65% Hemiplegia 50% Other Paralysis 30% Menstrual Disease 78% Brain Nerves and Premature Aging 90% The above statistics do not need to be explained, which proves that Dr. Wei Dan's success today is not accidental. I sincerely hope that Dr. Wei Dan will not leave Shanghai so that patients can seek help and get out of the sea of suffering. Check that Dr. Wei Dan is currently living in Room 707 of the Hwa Da Hotel on the Bund. Consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM (closed on Saturday afternoon and Sunday)</p>
<p>It is known that Dr. Wei Dan will broadcast a speech on the English 大美 Evening News Radio at 8:05 PM on Friday, April 18 (XMHC frequency 700)</p>

<h3>修學講座 How to Study Chinese Literature (5)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wu Jing</p>
<p>Excerpt: Life is finite, but books are infinite. Reading without remembering, or remembering without understanding, is futile. How much more so for those of average intelligence who merely skim the surface, forgetting as they read. The remedy is to make excerpts. For example, Gu Tinglin often said, "Good reading is not as good as good copying." His "Daily Knowledge Records" and "Eastern Study Notes" were all compiled from continuous excerpts. A friend of mine categorized and copied idioms from "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and dictionaries, eventually forming a volume that he could easily reference and use. Another student, whose Chinese grades were initially ordinary, improved remarkably in a short time. It turned out that over three years, he had excerpted and categorized phrases into ten volumes, similar to the composition dictionaries available in bookstores. While this may not be the best method for studying Chinese literature, it cultivates a habit of paying attention while reading, which is not without merit.</p>
<p>Index Cards: This method imitates library cataloging. Record the title, volume, page number, time, and author of articles from newspapers and magazines, whether they discuss issues or express opinions, on index cards. Categorize them according to their content and store them in custom-made drawers with small compartments. When researching a topic or writing an article, you can easily check them, synthesize, and analyze the information. With a wealth of material, a little organization can lead to a magnificent article. Others may think you have read thousands of books and write with divine inspiration, but it all relies on these small cards that manage your daily reading, allowing you to select information easily, saving time and effort, and preventing confusion. This aligns with the principle of effortless action.</p>
<p>Recitation: Vernacular Chinese may not require recitation, but prose does. While prose might not require recitation, poetry absolutely does. The structure of an article, in essence, requires attention to both its ideas and content, and to its form. Not only poetry and songs have rhythm; prose also possesses a natural rhythm. For example, "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, and the sage arises and all things are seen," or "Vague and indistinct, there is something within; elusive and indistinct, there is an image within." Are there not natural rhythms between the phrases? Some students write in a rambling, disorganized manner because they do not read enough, or they read without paying attention to the neatness of the phrases, the euphony of the sounds, and the grandeur of the style. Naturally, they cannot grasp the essence of writing. For example, the fluency of Mencius, the conciseness of Han Feizi, the unrestrainedness of Zhuangzi, the surging repetition of Han Yu, and the graceful variety of Ouyang Xiu, cannot be understood without loud recitation, which allows one to appreciate their masculine and feminine beauty.</p>
<p>Chanting: Chinese characters are formed from individual elements. The reason poetry and songs have harmonious rhythms and become beautiful compositions is that they contain many compound words, alliterations, assonances, or reduplicated words, combined with the changes of the four tones (level, rising, departing, entering) and the distinctions of the four phonetic openings (open, close, combined, contracted). Thus, what enters the ear has the wonders of high and low, fast and slow, soft and loud, and rising and falling. Talented individuals throughout history have grasped this intuitively, creating many immortal works. Even the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang and the overbearing nature of the Chu霸 King could not be completely burned away by a wildfire. In the Nineteen Old Poems, words like "青青," "盈盈," "皎皎," "娥娥," and "織織" are all reduplicated. Li Qingzhao's composition, "尋尋覓覓, 冷冷清清, 淒淒慘慘戚戚" uses reduplicated words throughout. Words with the same pronunciation are called alliterations, and words with the same rhyme are called assonances. Examples include "窈窕," "勉, 踟躕," "邂逅," "沮," "……" Just flip through the "经," and they are everywhere. If we do not chant these types of poems aloud, how can we know their divinity and subtle beauty?

<h3>Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Women's Group - Women's Youth Defeated by Jewish Team - Tonight Women's Youth vs. Hualian Women</h3>
<p>In the Sino-Western Cup table tennis competition, at 8 PM the night before last, the Jewish team played against the defending runner-up Women's Youth team in the Youth Association auditorium. Zhu Shangxin, a key player for the Women's Youth, had unfortunately gone to Hong Kong the day before. Fang Xiuwen, Wang Guangmei, and Zhang Dexin were also absent due to various reasons, greatly weakening their strength. The Jewish team, on the other hand, came with their full force, especially Madam Di Fei, whose chop shots were incredibly beautiful and effortlessly defeated four players from the Women's Youth team. As a result, the Jewish women defeated the Women's Youth with a score of 13 to 6, raising their hopes for the championship of this year's women's group. The Women's Youth team's lineup was scattered, so how could they not lose? This loss was equivalent to giving up their hopes of winning the championship, which is truly regrettable. Tonight, there will be another match, with the Hualian Women's team playing against the Women's Youth team in the women's group. Both teams were the champion and runner-up of the previous year, so it is sure to be exciting.</p>

<h3>Upsets in Jingwu Cup - Li Deng Eliminated - Wang Yang Win Sixth Group Championship</h3>
<p>The Jingwu Cup individual table tennis competition held the fifth group elimination round at the Jingwu Gymnasium the afternoon before last. Mr. Gu Kun served as the referee. Li Zongpei, the fifth-place finisher from the previous year and a famous short-blocking player, defeated Liu Ziyan, a strong player from Hualian, for the second time and faced Wang Changhou, a good looping player from Youbang, in the runner-up finals. The battle was intense. Wang narrowly defeated Li Zongpei with a score of three to two. After a short break, Wang and Li played the finals again. Wang's ball skills were like a whirlwind, and the score skyrocketed. Li was unable to recover. As a result, Wang Changhou won again in straight sets, winning the championship.</p>
<p>Wang Changhou 12-10 11-1 11-6 Li Zongpei</p>
<p>The sixth group of the Jingwu Cup was held the night before last. Seed Deng Xiurong was the sixth-place finisher from the previous year, specializing in attacking and looping, and was an outstanding talent last year. Yesterday, he successively defeated Zhang Jian and Huang Caode, creating a strong momentum. Yang Zhaoxiang, a looper from Youbang, also successively eliminated Zhou Kegang and Zhang Jian and faced Deng. Deng's loops were fierce at the start, easily winning in straight sets. Unexpectedly, in the second match against Yang, he immediately fell into difficulty. Although Deng took the lead, Yang eventually caught up. As a result, Yang narrowly won with a score of three to two. At that time, both sides had the same score, and a three-game tiebreaker was held. The tension of the competition was unprecedented. Deng had bad luck, and with a lead of two to one, he turned defeat into victory with a score of two to three. Yang won the championship of the sixth group.</p>

<h3>Democracy or Dictatorship?</h3>
<p>— Pan Li</p>
<p>Students in the social studies class at George School in Pennsylvania, USA, expressed doubts about the democratic way of life, believing that democratic systems were too inefficient. They believed that dictatorships were more efficient.</p>
<p>Teacher McFee had difficulty refuting this, so he said, "Well then, the only way to resolve the question of the merits of democracy versus dictatorship is through practical experimentation. For the sake of experimentation, this class will implement a dictatorship for the next two weeks." As a result, discussion was prohibited in the classroom, questions were not allowed, and severe punishments were imposed on those who barely passed. In addition, McFee organized a small secret police force, assigning four students to act as secret police, secretly listening to what students said outside of class and recording it. Then, one day, McFee suddenly read aloud in public a list of students' private criticisms of him and other teachers, rumors they had asked about, and violations of rules. The students were all shocked and surprised when they heard this, and they began to feel the ugliness of dictatorship. Thus, on the fifth day of implementing the dictatorship, all the students unanimously demanded the restoration of democracy.</p>
<p>Although this is just an amusing anecdote, it is not without considerable significance and lesson.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Camouflage in Nature</h3>
<p>— Jian Chen</p>
<p>Assuming that camouflage is "a military technique aimed at concealing the true nature of one's own movements, so as to passively evade enemy attacks and actively facilitate attacking the enemy," as military experts define it, then there are countless precedents in nature, but the designer is nature. So camouflage is a set of tricks that we humans are best at copying!</p>
<p>Color Change</p>
<p>In nature, the state of war is constant: weak animals cannot but rely on protective coloration to eke out a living, such as grasshoppers in the grass being green, and winter hares being white; while fierce creatures, like the brown lions in the African desert, and the white polar bears on the Arctic ice, also happily don coats of fur that blend in with their surroundings, so as to ambush and snatch prey. This cannot help but remind one of the uniforms of soldiers in plains countries, which mostly use gray or green, while the uniforms of Finnish soldiers resisting the Soviet Union the year before last were precisely snow-white! As for all kinds of animals that can rapidly change color at any time and in any place, such as octopuses, cuttlefish, isopods, and the most famous lizards, perhaps they can be compared to the actions of those spies who are fickle and constantly changing, and who can disguise themselves as all sorts of people!</p>
<p>Mimicry</p>
<p>There is an insect called the "dead leaf butterfly," which gets its name from the fact that when it is tired of flying and resting, it closes its wings together, hiding its bright colors, and the colors and veins on the outside completely resemble a dead leaf. There are very many other animals that can do mimicry. I think that during the last European war, in order to detect the German army's movements, the Allied forces moved the statue in front of a church bell tower on a hillside at night, replacing it with a completely identical statue that had been prefabricated, but was hollow in the middle to allow observers to hide; and there were also all sorts of actions, such as disguising dead trees, disguising dead horses, and disguising warships as merchant ships, in order to confuse the enemy, which can be categorized under this example.</p>
<p>Imitation</p>
<p>There is a kind of sand crab near the coast that likes to bite seaweed and attach it to its back or legs. The seaweed continues to grow, and soon it becomes a moving botanical garden. There is also a kind of "hermit crab," which puts its soft tail into the empty shell of a clam snail, and then takes one or two sea anemones on its back and swims slowly. If we look at this, isn't it an epitome of those tanks or armored vehicles covered with crisscrossing branches? There is also a bird called the chaffinch, which can disguise its nest with moss and lichen, making it difficult for people to recognize. During wartime, most of the positions, gun emplacements, and command posts were all supported by fishnets covered with green branches and leaves, confusing the enemy and making it impossible to tell whether they were real forests or fake forests; isn't this kind of behavior the same as the chaffinch?</p>
<p>Amulets</p>
<p>The cuttlefish can spew ink like releasing a smokescreen, as mentioned earlier. In the Italian coastal area, there is also a type of squid called Heteroteuthis: it can release a kind of luminous secretion from a special gland, surrounding itself, as if wrapped in a "fiery cloud"! Let us take these two things as a metaphor for the actions of those warships currently fighting in the Mediterranean: either using smoke bombs to confuse the enemy's target, or releasing searchlights to frighten the invading enemy planes!</p>
<p>False Death</p>
<p>Some animals, like sand fleas, paramecia, a certain kind of dung beetle, and hedgehogs, immediately curl up into a ball when they encounter danger, not moving at all, as if they were dead, so as to prevent the enemy from paying attention and treat them as inanimate objects such as stones and gravel. I remember that in the last European war, a submarine was being fiercely pursued by the enemy, and it was difficult to escape from the encirclement safely. The driver suddenly had a whimsical idea, deliberately opened the gasoline tank, and scattered the oil. As a result, a bright wave full of oil marks floated on the sea surface. The enemy thought that they had already hit it, and no longer needed to waste artillery shells. The driver's trick worked, and he safely left the tiger's mouth!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(Six) Crystallization of Love</p>
<p>What made her most difficult was actually the return of her father as before, and the sudden return of her brother together from the north, going to the Western Hills to recuperate; because at first her father had said that he was not used to that kind of "living off of his brother-in-law," and planned to use the several thousand dollars he had obtained from Yuan Baofan to take to Hangzhou, on the one hand to treat his son's lung disease, and on the other hand to find a place to settle down in the south, no longer returning to Tianjin. Who knew that upon arriving in Hangzhou, he would run into his brother-in-law who had quit his original job at the Zhejiang Provincial Office, wanting to go to Guangzhou to be the director of the telegraph bureau, and at the same time Dr. Fei of the Geling Sanatorium - the doctor who had always treated Xiangqi's brother and had already achieved some progress in his treatment - was also about to return to the United States due to the expiration of his contract, and before leaving he solemnly recommended a hospital in the Western Hills outside Beijing to them, so the Luo family father and son actually returned to the north together, adding two major burdens to Xiangqi, and she no longer dared to think about the idea of running away.</p>
<p>But staying in the Yuan family, even if Yuan Baofan didn't suspect anything in his heart, how could she stay herself? After the baby was born, did she really intend to recognize Old Yuan as the father?</p>
<p>But the swelling of her abdomen no longer allowed her to delay, and she had no choice but to temporarily let Yuan Baofan take some advantage, pretending to be very serious and telling him the good news, barely easing the situation.</p>
<p>This was naturally an even more overwhelming matter in the heart of Autumn Begonia. On the one hand, he had to worry about Xiangqi, fearing that someone would tell Yuan Baofan the truth before she gave birth; on the other hand, he couldn't help but feel anxious for himself, fearing that after the child was born, it would be taken away by Yuan Baofan, and he would become a stranger who would never know him.</p>
<p>Although his thinking was not stubborn, although his age was very young, and thoughts of "lineage issues" and "succession issues" had not yet entered his brain, he could not change his personality! He was someone who liked children the most, and in his eyes, none of the children in the world were not lively and adorable little angels; moreover, this future little angel was the crystallization of his and Xiangqi's love! Asking him to willingly give him up was really an impossible thing. (81)</p>

<h3>The Stone Statue of Time</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xu</p>
<p>Many people imagine that time is an old man, but how can time be an old man? Time will not grow old, it is you yourself who will grow old. So what is time? Time is an unfinished stone statue.</p>
<p>No one knows where this stone came from - do you know how time came about? It is probably a precious stone, and its texture must be very hard. It stands in a place that everyone in the world has to pass through, and once they have passed through, that person will not return; so every person, once they have passed through, picks up the chisel left by their predecessors and carves on it. A lazy person carves a stroke and leaves; but a diligent person refuses to put down the chisel until he cannot breathe; an unfortunate person dies before even getting close to it; but a mediocre person cannot carve a single mark. The stone is covered with knife marks, and countless people have passed through. Alas! What an arduous and long-lasting task this is!</p>
<p>But it never becomes a completed stone statue.</p>
<p>Its ears are carved out by itself, but there is only a rough outline; its hands and feet have been revealed, but they are still a blurry segment. It is almost the same as when it came.</p>
<p>How could the people of the past not have worked hard enough? Someone is complaining. Is complaining right? We cannot blame the past, we should blame ourselves for not working hard enough. How much more greedy for ease and lazy we are in our lives! Supposing we live to be sixty years old, we seem to be sleeping in bed for sixty years, constantly dreaming, and before long we have all become the past, without having made a single stroke on the stone statue.</p>
<p>The people of the past did work hard, and those rough lines are precisely the symbols of their work. Some of them are geniuses, some of them are heroes, some of them are good people who only leave their work and not their names... In short, they carved difficult lines on the stone statue of time with their respective abilities. They are indeed better than us, how can we continue to waste our time? Work is indeed difficult, sometimes it requires breaking the tiger's mouth, sweating profusely, and aching hands and feet, but if you fight it, carve a few strokes on it, then glory will be yours.</p>
<p>Time is a stone statue that will never be completed.</p>
<p>So let's work wholeheartedly, you who are working! Will you pass the stone statue of time silently, or will you contribute your share of work and receive universal praise? You have probably understood, so strike your chisel hard, you only have this precious one time.</p>
<p>Time is a stone statue that will not be completed, but it hopes to become a masterpiece. What kind of exquisite work of art will an unfinished masterpiece be! A masterpiece requires your conscience, passion, and character; if you are a lowly and evil person, you cannot participate in the work, because time's record is history, upright and unyielding. How will you work in today's era?</p>

<h3>The Place of Intoxication</h3>
<p>— Xue Li</p>
<p>Intoxication is the happiest thing in the world. When we are intoxicated in a certain place, we completely forget everything in the universe. The saying "Three cups and no ten thousand things, one drunk resolves a thousand sorrows" describes this state.</p>
<p>We find comfort and feel satisfied in the place of intoxication. We would rather pay a heavy price to exchange for a moment of intoxication. Everyone in the world has their own place of intoxication. Seeing their respective places of intoxication can reveal their character and predict their future.</p>
<p>Where is the best place of intoxication? Not in the dance hall, not in the gambling den, but in the garden of academia. When mathematicians are writing their straight lines and circles, and chemists are pouring their sulfuric acid and alcohol, their entire souls are intoxicated here, fulfilling them.</p>
<p>The value of academia, at least from this aspect of providing a place for intoxication, is already infinite.</p>

<p>Random Notes from the Chrysanthemum Garden</p>
<h3>On "The Joint Trial of Three Officials"</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>According to Cao Xinquan, "The Joint Trial of Three Officials" is originally a Xiaosheng (young male role) Zheng Gong (major performance) opera. Xu Xiaoxiang loved to sing this opera the most, and Tan Xinpei often accompanied him as Liu Bingyi, wearing purple official robes instead of blue official robes. Now, Liu Bingyi is commonly referred to as "Blue Robe," which is actually a mistake. It was only after the protagonist in this opera changed from Xiaosheng to Dan (female role) that the opera "Yu Tang Chun" was discovered. It is said that the opera "Yu Tang Chun" originated from the Bangzi Opera troupe. I have not seen the Bangzi "Yu Tang Chun," but I have seen Luo Xiaobao and Xiao Baisui's "Su San Qi Jie" (Su San Being Escorted) taken at Wang Yaoqing's house. At that time, Luo Xiaobao had not yet changed to Laosheng (old male role), and Su San's attire was Qingyi (virtuous woman role), with small-footed trousers and stilt shoes. Li Zhangren Yu Zeng once said that Yu Ziyun's "Joint Trial of Three Officials" was very famous, and the opera "Yu Tang Chun" originated from Ziyun. Ziyun played Yu Tang Chun on stilts, indicating that the old-style "Yu Tang Chun" female roles all wore stilt shoes. Two years ago, the newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin argued for a long time about the appropriate role for Su San. One side said that it should be played by a Huadan (vivacious young female role), while the other side advocated for a Qingyi opera. In fact, the role of Su San should be performed by a Guimen Dan (young unmarried woman role), similar to Jin Yunu in "Beating the Unfaithful Lover with a Stick" and Dongfang Shi in "Hongni Pass." Having a Huadan sing it loses her status; having a Qingyi play it does not suit her position; both are incorrect. In the past thirty years, many experts have regarded it as a Huadan opera, so the mournful play is performed with seductive expressions. "Yu Tang Chun took his name from a nobleman," "Sixteen years old...Young Master Wang," "Let's reminisce about old times under the altar," "Yu Tang Chun is like the stamen of a flower..." These lines are all Su San's tragic history. Mentioning this matter is truly "past events too painful to recall." How sorrowful and poignant should it be? But the female performers who sing this today, none of them are not timid, affected, shy, and smiling. Under the imposing and stern questioning of the three officials, being so frightened as to only want to escape death, what shame is there to be afraid of, what affectation to make, why be shy, and how dare one smile flirtatiously? At this time, Su San uses the word "loneliness" to win the sympathy of the three officials, not to seduce them with her looks. The root of the error is that the actors do not understand the personality of the role they are playing. If they can carefully understand Yu Tang Chun's status and situation, there will naturally be no lightly frowning and smiling performances.</p>
<p>The old-style Wang Jingjiang had a written statement, but now, except for Jiang Miaoxiang, it has been omitted. Liu Bingyi, in the past, Li Shunting and Shen Sanyuan also wore red official robes, but now they all wear blue official robes. I have seen Gao Qingkui, Tan Xiaopei, Ma Lianliang, Zhou Xinfang, Zhang Chunyan, and Bao Jixiang perform it, and they were all excellent. Liu Jingran and Lei Xifu's Pan Bizheng (Cheng Yanqiu originally called Zhou Jiliang) can also be called absolutely superb. The late Wang Rongsen was also considered a talented performer of this role in the South. Su San not wearing stilt shoes, but changing to colored shoes, and changing the Qingyi to crime clothes and trousers, plus a waist-cinching skirt, is said to have been the first by Wang Yaoqing; Mei Lanfang was the first to learn from Wang. Logically, Su "is a criminal who murdered her husband, and there is a need to wear crime clothes and trousers. At the same time, Su San needs to wear stilt shoes. When "watching the severe torture being served," now they all raise one big foot, which is really not as good-looking as wearing stilt shoes.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Juexin</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng and Yun Yanxia of Tianchan Stage are about to leave after completing the thirteen episodes of Jin Biao Huang Tianba. Originally, Tianchan had already invited the civil and military Laosheng Zhang Yunlou to fill his vacancy. On the one hand, they also asked Xin Xin Stage to borrow the female Dan Mao Jianqiu for a short-term performance from April 16th to May 11th. However, due to the issue of billing, Zhang Yunlou expressed his unwillingness to do it again, and the Tianchan authorities did not retain him. After discussion by the drama department, Gao Xueqiao was assigned to play the role of Huang Tianba in the fourteen episodes of the new play.</p>
<p>The Three Episodes of the Strange Hero Ouyang De at the Gong Stage has begun rehearsals after the play was completed the night before last. All the actors participated overnight. "Singing and dancing" scenes have been added, and Xuan Gang is still hired as the professor. In terms of roles, Zhao Ruquan plays Ouyang De from beginning to end, Liu Hanchen plays both Su Yonglu and Cai Qing, Wang Shaolou plays Xu Sheng in the first part and Liu Detai in the second part, and Li Ruchun plays Gao Tonghai in the first part and Wu Jie in the second part. As for the date of the premiere, it has not been determined yet, but it is not far away.</p>
<h3>Before the Premiere of Hong Xuanjiao</h3>
<p>— Wei Ruhui</p>
<p>The historical drama of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, "Hong Xuanjiao," is being premiered. The production of this script during the writing process of the "Southern Ming Historical Drama" four kinds was entirely unexpected for me. Although I had thought about writing a play about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom centered on Hong Xuanjiao before the war, all the historical materials of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom I had collected over the years were taken by Han Sheng to write "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," so it was just a passing thought.</p>
<p>This time, the China Traveling Drama Troupe is premiering at the Lyceum Theatre. Ruo Qing, hoping for a new script, came to force me to write it for her in a swift and decisive manner. I felt very hesitant because my interest in the past few months has been entirely in "bibliography," and there are still several scripts that I have promised to write but have not yet submitted. But in the end, I couldn't resist her "continuous forcing," and I had to agree to write "Hong Xuanjiao."</p>
<p>Hong Xuanjiao is the most outstanding of the female heroes in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. She is rich in nationalistic thought, is a brave general, and is skilled in medicine, able to treat wounded soldiers. In politics, she is also a resourceful person. Her mind is very clear. When she discovers that Xiuquan and his gang are corrupt, complacent, and engaged in infighting and cannot be with them, she "retires to a folk residence," and even "the ministers and nuns" "cannot stop her." Her character is also very decisive. Therefore, Hong Xuanjiao's life and its changes are completely in line with the growth and destruction of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p>The failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom did not begin after arriving in Tianjing. Hong Daquan, the leader of the "Restoration of the Ming Dynasty" faction, was arrested and killed in Hunan, and Xiuquan slaughtered the "Restoration of the Ming Dynasty Party" in the army to weaken their power, which is the first reason. Secondly, after arriving in Tianjing, they became corrupt, complacent, and did not think about progress. Thirdly, the leading kings killed each other, and the national clan and powerful ministers framed the loyal and good. The economic system could not be established, and the people's suffering was not alleviated first, which was of course the basis for failure. Other factors, such as the different origins and perceptions of the kings and the failure to utilize international relations, also had a significant impact.</p>
<p>I have tried my best to explain these factors in the main line and in the development of the plot, based on historical facts. I hope to paint a clearer picture of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The regret is that the premiere date is too close, and I was unable to fully prepare. I only spent ten days reading historical materials and writing the play. I hope to have the opportunity to revise it again.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Fei Mu, for your enthusiastic direction.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiongpa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Temporary Drunkenness Beside the Beautiful Woman's Zither</p>
<p>After saying this, she smiled slightly at Li Xin and leaned her head into Li Xin's arms. She also said, "Although I am the daughter of a green forest, I have always kept myself chaste and am not a licentious person. Don't look down on me. Now that I am serving the young master and sleeping with him, if the young master wants to abandon me again, I will have no face to live in this world anymore. I am willing to borrow a three-foot-long sword and die by the young master's side." As Hong Niangzi said this, tears had already dripped from her clear eyes. Li Xin listened to Hong Niangzi's words and felt that she was very gentle and tactful, and he suddenly realized that all the previous experiences were due to Hong Niangzi's love. Seeing her sometimes frowning slightly, sometimes smiling lightly, although she is a female bandit, she is so gentle and charming that she is lovely. Who would know that she is a female demon on the battlefield? Li Xin thought this way. After all, he is not a callous man. Now his heart is gradually wavering. No matter what hero or heroine, as long as his heart moves, he will be unable to make up his mind and lose his integrity. Therefore, Li Xin's heart was originally as hard as stone, but after Hong Niangzi did this, it naturally softened. It was not until the sun was high in the sky that the lovers' dream finally awoke. The two of them put on their clothes and got out of bed, smiling at each other. After a while, Li Xin saw Tong Tianbao, but he couldn't help but feel a little ashamed on his face. When Tong Tianbao saw that Li Xin had already succumbed, he secretly admired his sister's ingenious design and invited Li Xin to be the second leader. Li Xin had no choice but to agree. After Hong Niangzi shared the joys of love with Li Xin, she stayed with him day and night, thinking that she had obtained a handsome talent, and her heart was very happy, spending sweet time. Before they knew it, it had been almost a month. However, Li Xin's loss of himself as a bandit was all attracted by the magic of Hong Niangzi. Although he had fun on the mountain every night, and spent his days in the arms of love, his heart could not help but still remember his hometown, and he was unwilling to be buried in the mountains and forests for a long time. Therefore, he still wanted to escape from the bandit den and return to Qixian to be a good citizen. But Hong Niangzi guarded him every day, never leaving him, so there was no opportunity to become a bird out of a cage. It just so happened that one day Tong Tianbao led the bandits down the mountain to attack a certain city, wanting to join forces with Li Zicheng's band of rebels, so the mountain was very empty.

<p>Because of purity, there is selflessness; because of selflessness, one can get rid of the small self; because of great love, one can think for the masses; because of thinking for the masses, one can get rid of the small self; because of righteousness, one's heart is bright; because one's heart is bright, one can get rid of the small self. Purity belongs to thought, great love belongs to spirit, and righteousness belongs to attitude. The unity of the three is the expression of personality.</p>
