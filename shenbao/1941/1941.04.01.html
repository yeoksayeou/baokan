<p>社評</p>
<h3>期待的成熟</h3>
<p>在「民治國兵工廠」正事努力工作的時候，遠東方面的戰事狀况却如近日中外報紙電訊所紀述。當然，這不是足以決定遠東全局的勝敗，但猶有應加闡明者。</p>
<p>中國一般人皆因積多年久戰的經驗，已能不復向戰報的告捷之中找刺激。回想當年台兒莊之役，捷報初傳，舉國欣喜若在；而最近的勝利乃不見一般因此而欣喜愈甚。却見一般的鎭靜異常，這不能小稱許為意態的進步至於沉着。沉着是理解與自信的總和。理解這不是最後勝利；理解這是所自信的最後勝利之前奏，現在不但尙未總反攻，抑且尙未作何大規模的局部反攻；理解總反攻的發動，非可以出之以浮躁的不耐煩，而確是尙有所期待。蓋剖析戰事，無論在江西方面，或在太湖方面，皆由日本以數路重兵、同時進攻，這一事實，這一動態，無論如何還須承認這一次戰略的主動地位尙在日方，而非中國所欲掠美；中國軍隊對於各地之先棄後取，這不是後半局另成一局而可稱之為反攻，實是中國對於這一次的兩地戰局，自始至終。各以一個運動戰術而獲致如此結果。</p>
<p>日方當然亦有其久戰的經驗，在這一次，有比往昔不同的特徵，便是緘默。四個月來，雙方在各地前綫雖繼續不斷在交綏之中，絕未停頓，然綜觀全局，可謂是膠着狀態。在這期間，日本換了統帥，是一個前進的戰略家，是一個對華作戰的駕輕就熟者，此來自有其抱負，自有所作為；來了之後，除了華南，調遣隊伍以在長江下游為最頻繁；於是江西方面，太湖方面，同時開展了四個月來各地前綫所未嘗有的塲面了。這是日本的春季攻勢，但這一次却進行於緘默之中。</p>
<p>現在對於日本所有的力量，還不應估量太低，他再度發動何地何季的攻勢，還有其可能。但從他所更換的統帥起，迄於這一次的兩地戰事，加以觀察，自不難想像鋒銳的程度。同時，中國力面的戰鬥力，除了每經一次攻勢，受一次測驗，得一次證明之外，至少從太湖西岸以迄贛西，由這次戰事而顯見不因新四軍之解散而使戰鬥力受何影響；若說因為解散新四軍而整飭了軍紀，始有此戰績，或說不解散新四軍則將有更大的戰績，這是多餘的推論了。至於根據了日方攻勢的測騐，推論中國立即發動總反攻的可能，則問題已不在日方的兵强勢盛，堅不可摧，却在中國總反攻所需的必要工具，已吾具備。因此之故，中日間倘若不由日方變更其政策而必待戰爭來作最後的解決，則必然期待着兩焦點中之一點的成熟：一是中日雙力力量依着原來消長的趨勢，以迄於一戰而決；一是「民治國兵工廠一的供給中國以必需的工具的成熟；而最近兩地戰事的戰績，是以嶄新的事實保證了兩焦點的必然性。</p>

<p>紐約　商報頃載稱、據最可靠消息、美國商船準備租與英國者、共有一百二十艘至一百四十五艘（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>歐戰業談西綫戰局的清算</h3>
<p>德軍在荷蘭京城與荷軍總司令部所在地的海牙，也同樣地表現了一次。可是在海牙東南三哩的伊本堡地方，傘兵驅逐荷軍的企圖却失敗了，運輸飛機落地後，德軍方自機中爬出，便受着機關槍的掃射。在德夫脫地方，運輸飛機都降落在公路，一等軍隊落地，便不惜犧牲，故意駛入壕溝，讓出地位，以便餘機降落。他們把通往海牙的要道阻斷，截留來往的荷人車輛，載兵向海牙前進。華爾哈文方面，空軍陸戰隊的降下，絡釋不絕，以增援佔領馬狄克和杜烈希橋樑的傘兵。</p>
<p>參加「垂直包圍」的德軍，其胆氣之豪，確是使人驚歎。他們降落的人數既少，降落的地點，又與荷軍兩師相持的德軍陣綫相距有七八十哩之遙。他們全靠陸上步隊的迅速赴援和敏捷佔領末斯河上的重要橋樑，方能免於殲滅。假使他如果能襲佔荷京，全部荷軍的神經中樞一時失效，荷軍的抵抗力便將立將崩潰了。</p>
<p>德軍由無數急降轟炸機前導，在黎明時衝向邊疆。荷蘭邊防兵不經一擊，便向兩側敗退。德軍向前推進，至下午，先頭部隊已進抵北部格萊倍方面的主要防錢。在南部批爾一綫，荷軍為穿着荷蘭憲兵制服的第五縱隊所阻，不及在琴納普把橫跨末斯河的重要橋樑炸燬。德軍雖損失裝甲火車一列，但依然潮湧而進，中午已到密爾的第一道防錢。另外一師，則在羅歐蒙之南强渡過末斯河。當天，德國步兵在格萊倍前綫共前進十五哩，在羅歐蒙之南渡過末斯河的德軍，更使批爾綫的側翼大受威脅。唯有在海牙降陸的德軍，大部份為荷蘭第一軍所包圍。荷政府急向英法兩國呼籲，請求援助。</p>
<p>五月十一日晌午，海牙一所樹木繁茂的公園中，突然降下三百個傘兵，離開荷蘭國會祇有一哩之遙，另外一隊傘兵，降落的地點，與荷蘭王宮僅隔着五幢房屋，無疑的是想綁架王室，同時一隊武裝第五縱隊也向警察總局攻擊。接着巷戰爆發，荷軍幸得輕戰車之助，苦戰一小時半，方把德軍擊退。</p>
<p>全盤局勢，盡出荷軍總司令溫克曼將軍意料之外，他有若干部隊，受敵夾擊，甚至被迫兩面作戰。德傘兵在離他司令部不足一哩處降落，事實上在他戶外就有巷戰發生。十二哩以外的洛特丹，也有大隊空軍陸戰隊降落。第五縱隊不時向他司令部揑報消息，許久纔能判明眞偽。至於司令部得免轟炸的唯一保障，全靠留在對街的德國駐荷外交人員。此時荷蘭危急巳極，唯籍外援纔能得救。那天即有法軍摩托化部隊一師和戰車隊一師，向北移動，止於勃來大，這支兵力，果能積極運用，或不難掃蕩洛特丹的德軍。</p>
<p>五月十二日，德軍繼續挺進，批爾前錢的德軍機械化師團前進二十哩，衝抵赫琴托抱煦。華爾哈文降落的德空軍陸戰隊已近萬人，又在停泊末斯河中的游艇裏起出預先秘藏的大砲和重兵器，飛往華爾哈文的運輸機中，有一架在中途擊落，其中還載着師團長所乘的戰馬呢。</p>
<p>五月十三日，戰事還是一面倒。格萊倍陣綫前面的區域，並未放水淹沒，若非為了第五縱隊的搗亂，便是為了措手不及，荷蘭所嘗誇耀一時的堤防，至此竟一無所用。德國裝甲部隊在赫托琴抱煦突破了批爾錢，經過馬狄克，至下午四時，已與杜勒希的德軍取得聯絡。然而勃來大的法軍若肯盡力，從側面擊破德軍的機械化部隊，即不難使其「垂直包圍」戰略攻虧一簣。可是法軍在連續不斷的空軍轟炸下，一無動作。荷蘭大軍巳被截為二，大有全部消滅的危險。洛特丹大部份已化為一片焦土，這裹的德國空軍也已與機械化部隊取得聯絡。勃來大的法軍向南退却，在十四日那天，溫克曼將軍便宜佈投降了。</p>
<p>荷蘭戰地軍隊死傷不過二萬三千，並未潰敗，且有大部份未動，可是荷軍已完全陷於混亂，殲滅已在所不免了。</p>
<p>這時候，德國陸空兩軍向比利時撲攻亦巳開始。其空軍機隊數在五百至六百五十之間，據各方估計，的有戰鬥機七千架至一萬架之間。聯軍飛機總計雖亦不下此數，共有機隊四百，戰鬥機的六千架，可是指揮旣不統一，行動允難一致</p>
<p>德空軍一開始便把荷比空軍掃蕩無餘。聯軍曾在五月十日至十四日間調動轟炸機一百架，輔以戰鬥機，作零星的反攻，結果被德空軍打得落花流水。五月十四日塞當附近一戰英機九十五架，一次就損失了四十架，另一次英機六十五架，損失三十五架，自五月十四日以後，聯軍方面實際上巳無力白天轟炸了。</p>
<p>德屬空軍，在攻擊方面雖極重要，但要決定勝收，非有陸軍部隊佔領陣地不可。這種部隊都是精選的勁旅，曾受爭奪戰特殊訓練。實則聯軍方面的防禦堡壘都巳被他們攝成照相，德軍且在國內製成模型實地演習，一旦身歷其境，當然可以駕輕就熟了。德軍每次進攻，都由較小分隊擔任正面攻擊，由一位强毅果敢的指揮官率領。他們身上，各種需用的兵器，如破壞鐵絲網的器具，手溜彈，炸藥，斧頭，鐵剷，指南針，沙袋，自動手槍，輕機關槍，烟幕彈等，莫不應有盡有，正像一家活動五金舖子。在一陣砲火和烟幕的掩蔽之下，他們向堡壘蛇行而進，槍彈紛紛向碉堡的砲口準確發射。鐵絲網只要破成一孔，指揮官和若干專家就向前快跑，衝至瞭望孔下的「死角」，餘者也分向堡壘的後方和側翼展開。他們把牛溜彈由砲孔損入碉堡，萬一砲孔堵塞，就用炸彈把碉堡炸毀，有時候也用噴火戰車進攻。</p>
<p>愛本伊默爾砲臺位於亞爾倍運河防綫，號稱為最堅固的堡壘，牆垣厚達一百二十英尺，且有四分之一英里闊的亞爾倍運河環繞左右。可是奉命炸毀運河上兩座橋樑的兵士，已被殺害，德軍奔過兩橋，便從後面攻擊砲臺。一架飛機，拖着幾架滑翔機，滿載敢死隊，降到砲臺中空地。他們早在波蘭方面從事演習，這時候便如法泡製，一一自機中跳出，各司其職，有的用手溜彈炸門，有的從通氣孔中投下炸彈。比軍慌亂之餘，便舉手投降了。</p>
<p>原先在法國北部嚴陣以待的英法大軍，這時已開入比境，願與德軍一決勝負，可惜他們的行動巳太遲了。德軍傘兵在亞爾倍運河沿岸及盧森堡一帶，紛紛降落，使比利時軍心動搖。列日重鎭在五月十三日即吿陷落，德軍祇留小隊圍攻尙未納降的砲臺，主力軍隊則繼續進發。雷欣諾將軍和克魯格將軍指揮第六軍團和第四軍團擴大了亞爾倍運河綫的裂口，進抵那摩爾和地維勒之間的末斯河畔。</p>
<p>德軍計劃果是圓滿地進行了。聯軍見德軍向比利時的攻勢極銳，不由得上了大當，以為還是舒利芬的原來計劃，便驅軍北進，這時主力攻擊的機會已到，德軍便在五月十四日，運用全力，向南方的塞當疾進。這路縱深配備着的德軍不下七十師。步兵攻擊以前先用急降轟炸機一千架，猛炸法國砲臺，連續達二十五小時之久，德國步兵工程突擊隊接着向前推進，把防綫突破了。一般見解都以為德軍的突破法軍陣綫，應歸功於戰車，其實還是突擊隊的功勞，陣綫突破以後，德軍裝甲師團便從缺口處如洪水般衝入。自此以後，一切便都完了。法軍巳一蹶不振，不能重整旗鼓。其第九軍團在柯蘭普將軍的指揮之下，雖作戰英勇，終至全軍覆沒。</p>
<p>德軍充分利用這一次的突破，確足令人稱述。在上次世界大戰中，雙方亦常突破敵陣，但不能乘機利用以造成戰略上的勝利，這是重大的失着。德軍在塞當周圍的方略很簡單，是以機器車隊輕重戰車和飛機，編成光鋒隊，由一個司令官在地面上獨負指揮之責。他們祇是浩浩蕩蕩，一路前進，不暇鞏固所得的陣地。戰車把砲壘和機關槍網毀成平地，萬一為平射砲所阻，別的戰車隊又向兩側包圍敵後攻擊，有時候這種任務由機械化部隊執行，有時候戰車也用無綫電向轟炸機乞助。</p>
<p>德軍所有戰車，的在七千至七千五百輛之間編成十個裝甲師團。此外還有摩托化部隊六師。戰車都附帶着平射砲，一遇法國戰卓迎頭抵抗，便立刻加以轟燬。德國裝甲車隊仍用着集中攻擊和出奇制勝的舊式戰略。他們勇敢異常，不顧一切，他們的偵察車隊，避免作戰，直闖過軍心渙散的法軍之後，前進之速，往往使法軍不及把橋樑炸燬，便被他們奪路而過。</p>
<p>德國大軍，在後聲援，先之以摩托化部隊，繼之以急行軍前進的步兵。機械化師平均日行二十五英里。他們深入敵軍後，佔領付鎭後，總把電話交通毀壞，他們的口號是迅速。某次有五十名德兵駕駛着三輛輕戰車，使聯軍運輸車一千五百輛停頓了不少時間。他們經過地雷密佈的戰塲時，先用砲猛烈火轟擊，或在黑夜偷埋催爆網，使他剛巧在戰車攻擊前爆炸，開闢前進路綫。他們乘着橡皮艇渡過設防的河流時，父常用烟幕掩護。</p>
<p>比利時境內的聯軍雖於五月十五日退至地耳河，又於十六日退往鄧德勒河，但撒退時還整然有序。他們怎知道德國主力部隊，正在他們之南，在小馬奇諾防綫之後向西疾進，席捲了塞當，美齊爾，加斯，聖昆丁，直趨亞眠和阿拉斯呢！</p>
<p>英國遠征軍和比軍在北路所受的壓力雖然較輕，但也被迫退至許爾德河。至五月十二日，德軍突破處巳展至英吉利海峽沿岸的亞倍維爾，在此以北的聯軍，遂完全孤立了。</p>
<p>這時假使聯軍的配備和德軍相仿德軍的地位也就非常危險。聯軍可兩面夾攻，直抵海岸，把陷入其中的德軍擊成粉碎。但因軍備的强弱懸殊，陷於絕對危險境地中的不是德軍，而是聯軍。</p>
<p>法軍，曾於五月二十和二十一兩日在摩柏巨和華倫西的附近反攻，但宋得手。五月二十二日德軍又集中所有的戰車，想在阿拉斯附近突破一點，亦因為時太晚和實力太弱而失敗了。餘如二十三日在剛白萊的嘗試，二十四日在亞眠附近的嘗試，也都徒勞無功。</p>
<p>英軍已感到可施，便開始向海峽各口岸撤退，作登船歸國之計，豈知德軍巳沿岸抄襲，想把這三角地帶全部封閉。自此以後，法蘭德之戰，就變成三角形兩邊的包圍戰了。比軍孤立無援，遂於五月二十八日投降，英軍左翼空虛，太受威脅，實際上在五月二十日，英軍早就開始撤退。至二十九日，乘船回國的巳有八萬之衆。</p>
<p>德軍滿想可以把孤立的聯軍一網打盡，不料正在此時英國已集合海峽對岸根據地的全部飛機，而德軍則將大部空軍，用於索姆河的南面，以防法軍主力的反攻，使英軍驟然獲得了暫時的局部制空權。</p>
<p>英軍又得天時之助，海峽濃霧瀰漫，六百六十五艘船隻，遂得在兩日之內，載運十一萬大軍渡海回國。以後四日，陸續被救的又有十六萬人。</p>
<p>法蘭德之戰乃是從古以來一幕演變最述的大慘劇。便這樣的宣吿結束，歐洲大陸的戰局就此一瀉千里，無可挽回了。</p>

<h3>工部局董事名額　談判仍未臻妥洽領袖領事宣布選舉延期　有關各方均為未發表意見</h3>
<p>據昨日工部局化式發表、「領袖領事希爾頃發布百略稱、前經規定四月丸十兩日為本屆工部局重事曁地產委員選舉日期、現在上項日期、予以取消、選舉事宜、應即展緩舉行、至於候選人名單收受日期、亦予一併展緩、」按本屆工董選舉、原定於四月二三兩日舉行、後內各有關國家僑民團體談商不及、經領事圖核准展緩至四月九十兩日、英美日二國總領事遂進行談判、對局董比數擬有變更、而英日橋民領袖凱自威與渡邊亦策動幕後談判、擬成立「君子協定」、增减董事人數、但迄今句餘、未獲解决、按照地皮章程、工董選舉祇及展期一次、不得再延、而今竟又無定期展延、可知三領事之談判、已遭遇不易解決之困難，而象徵今年工董選畢將有重大之變化、各界人士對此咸寄重視、但有關官方仍嚴守緘默、拒不發表任何有關百論、</p>
<p>已否妥協　無法獲知</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本年度工部局董事選舉、至今（三十一日）晨依然疑團莫釋、蓋英美日總領事為修改工董比數而進行之會談、已吾商得妥洽、官方仍不予披露也、至於央僑巳推定之英董名、工部局今日仍守緘默、亦不宣布巳吾認接獲日董候選人之姓名單、查下屆工董之推舉、已定明日（一日）午刻截止迄今僅美董候運人已經披露、即明思德與阿業滿是、聞業巳推定之五英董、均係現任英董、日董候選人姓名、迄未可知、</p>
<p>延期原因　種種傳說</p>
<p>昨日新聲、記者向消息靈通方面探悉、此次工董選舉再度延期最可能之原因如下、（一）日納稅人內部缺少領袖人才、意見米能統、目前居留民團長渡南之魄力與才幹、不及林雄吉、難孚衆望、故渡邊與凱自威之談判、未能福利、（二）英美僑民方面、對於改變工董比數、一般言之、反對者多、贊成者少、致使若干負責談判者感覺無大衆後盾之慮、（三）如日美董事人數各將增加、則各該國僑民團體必須召集會議、正式推出候選人、此非為短期內所能為、（四）如工董中要增加其他國籍人士、英美日華除外）則領事團方面（必先徵得其他國橋民團體之同意、方能決定、此亦頗費時基於上述原因、工董選舉之再延期、頗為合理、但納稅年會之日期為四月十七日不加改變、故衆料一切可望於年會舉行前一周內全部解决、而選舉之延期最多不過三四日、</p>
<p>日方態度　諱莫如深</p>
<p>據另一報吿、本屆工董選舉、日董人數、至少將增加一人、因日方報紙前曾屢作此種聲明、「除非日僑在此次競選中失敗、日董人數必須增加」、衆信此次三國總領事之談判、必以此點為爭執之中心、唯三國領事或巳取得某種諒解、有條件的允日僑推出三人為工部局董事、據悉日居留民團、日納稅人協會日各馬路聯合會等將由「改變選舉制度委員會」主持召開一聯席會議、再推出董事候選人一名、以居留民團主席渡邊之呼聲最高、至現任日董岡本及嵩雄西氏、可望蟬聯無疑、昨日日方報紙、對於此事諱莫如深、而官方亦緘口不高、似有所待、</p>
<p>華董方面　保持緘默</p>
<p>關於目下工部局華董之處境、顯為各方所關切二月間、華納稅人方面開始選舉下屆華董候選人、因種種關係、採用通信選舉方法、結果由虞洽卿·袁履登·陳霆銳·奚玉書、及郭順等五人蟬聯、不意上月中虞洽卿托病離滬、衆信在目前情形下、華董之處境、固極困難、但各方所寄之關切、反形增加、對於此次工董選舉問題央美三國之爭執、華董方面、絕未表示仟何意見、雖日小將設法操縱華董但迄今華董力面未作任何表示、</p>

<h3>吃角子老虎大王訟案開審旁聽記</h3>
<p>— 百</p>
<p>駐華美按察使海爾密克，昨（三十一日）晨開庭續審上海「吃角子老虎大王」傑克拉萊經營賭博一案，經詳細審問挨，判決將傑氏解回美國麥克尼爾島監獄，徒刑十八個月，苟在獄中行為良好，可减刑至十一個月。</p>
<p>睡眠不足　精神萎頓</p>
<p>傑氏昨晨被押到庭時，因在華德路西牢睡眠不足，頗形萎頓。先由按署律師希爾資陳述傑氏經營賭博之罪狀，並謂傑氏在法侖夜總會設輪盤賭台，較諸「吃角子老虎」尤為嚴重，如該總會近有兩人因賭博而喪生，即其一例。</p>
<p>聞及往事　失聲痛哭</p>
<p>被吿律師羅逑繼起辯護，滔滔不絕，主張從寬發落。羅逑言及傑氏資助貧苦，絕不鄙吝時，傑氏俯首桌上，失聲痛哭。羅逑辯護各節如次：（一）關於在法侖夜總會設輪盤賭台事，傑氏於去年六月購得法侖夜總會之半數股票，時該總會業巳設有輪盤賭台，傑氏被捕後，即將該項股票以四十萬元售予法侖氏。</p>
<p>至七十歲　方能出獄</p>
<p>（二）關於「吃角子老虎」事，美國總統輪船十與上海美第四陸戰隊俱樂部內，均設此項機器；而第四陸戰隊俱樂部中設有此機三十三架之多，若謂此機違運，則美軍指揮官必不許俱樂部中有此機存在。（三）關於向美按署交保後潛逃事，傑氏此舉，乃一時錯誤；因渠自己現年四十四歲，前在美國奧克拉賀瑪州監獄，尙有徒刑二十二年禾滿，今若兩罪俱發，則連回未滿之二十二年徒刑在內，入獄後非至七十歲，不得恢復自由。</p>
<p>被控罪名　計十七款</p>
<p>羅逑續稱傑氏被控犯罪十七項，實可併為兩項，即設賭台與「吃角子老虎」是，關於後者，則向法租界公董局領有執照，目傑氏保金美金二萬五千元，因不到庭而被沒收，實巳處以重罰，故判傑氏徒刑六個月巳足。羅逑復爰引數年前公共租界賭棍茄西亞等僅被華方特區法院判處徒刑一年等先例，又謂美國奧州當局諒巳不必緝捕傑氏歸案，否則傑氏早巳被捕矣。</p>
<p>自述一生　奮鬥經過</p>
<p>傑氏得推事海爾密克許可繼起發言，先謂避小到庭，乃愚蠢行為，續乃自述簡史，謂其父嗜酒無度，年甫四齡，其母即棄父子他去，渠乃入孤兒院。稍長，販報為生，一面求學。年十九，入美海軍，曾參與世界大戰。退伍後，往奧州充出租汽車司機，菜次駕車至叢林附近，乘客被刦，渠遂被捕，匪徒久未緝捕到案，渠遂被法庭處徒刑，因其駕車載旅客至業林附近故也。入獄三年後，渠參加該獄棒球隊，某次隨隊赴百哩外，搭頭火車，車駛他方，故渠並非有意越獄。推事海爾密克聆聽，即判傑氏徒刑十八個月。</p>

<p>未向當局　領取關單</p>
<p>據探悉，蘭姆賽斯號離港、事先未向本市當局領取結關單、此間航界人士相信、該輪殆將配備武裝、改成剽襲船、參加太平洋中戰事、輪兩側髹有字旗標記、且高懸此旗、今留滬之軸心國巨輪、僅義輪康鐵凡田號（一八·七穴五噸）、近傳困泊巴西各口岸之軸心國船隻、已有一艘起椗駛往海參崴、故蘭姆賽斯號之離滬、頗堪注意、按駛離巴西之軸心國船三艘為義貨船弗列斯科號（二·七九〇噸與弗蘭哥瑪台里號（一〇·八〇〇噸（及德貨輪特萊斯登號（五·五六七噸）、此輪係德國北德公司所有、已於星期日駛離巴西之桑吐斯港、</p>

<h3>棉紗商人　謝克昌遭槍殺自紗號出外突遭阻擊　頭部中兩彈當塲畢命</h3>
<p>公共租界河五路（天津路口）恒利大樓鬥前、於昨日上午十一時半、發生槍擊案一起、被擊者係棉紗商人謝克昌、當塲中彈、傷在要害、旋即斃命、茲將平明社記者訪悉各情分誌於後、</p>
<p>突遭狙擊</p>
<p>謝克昌、浙江餘姚縣人、年三十五歲、自設大昌興棉紗號於河南路叫九五號恒利人樓四樓四零七號房間經營棉紗布疋生息、獲利尙佳、謝平日居於該號隔壁四零六號宿舍、昨日上午十一時三十分許、謝身穿灰色條子花呢袍子、足穿黃皮鞋、正由號內出外、擬往市塲、聆取行情、方走出恒利大樓、正跨登自備包車之際、（包車照會七九二五號）、詎兇手預伺於門前、不問情出、袖出手槍、向謝狙擊二槍、</p>
<p>中彈畢命</p>
<p>謝斯時猝不及防、右太陽穴被擊中二槍、彈由後腦穿出、應聲倒臥於車墊上、血花四濺、氣絕畢命、謝之包車夫宋阿二（通州人年四十二歲）見狀、驚惶失措、呆若木鷄、兇手於事後向南逃逸無踪、當出事時、恒利大樓之司閣捕、雖目覩一切、奈因無槍械、祗得任兇手逸去、</p>
<p>捕房勘察</p>
<p>出事後、經包車去遄返四樓、向大昌興號報吿兇耗、即由大昌興報吿中央捕房、經警務處派員率領中西探捕馳往出事地點、奈兇手巳查如黃鶴、當在附近獲嫌疑者一人、經證明係某銀行信差、與案無關、當即釋放、至死者謝克昌、由捕召救護車到來、載送仁濟醫院、候報法院勘騐、</p>
<p>流彈傷人</p>

<h3>小型劇塲素描</h3>
<p>— 路韶</p>
<p>每到夕陽西下時，在四馬路大新街這一個角落裏，總可以看見十百成羣的人們，從一處不大光亮的階層上，磨肩接踵的緩步下來，大家想必知道，這就是靑蓮閣散茶館了。在這一陣熱鬧過去以後，還有一陣熱鬧，接着而來，大的在晚上七點多錦的校樣，一個「小型」的平劇塲—小廣寒—開譯了，戲臺上一張長方棹上的兩盞檯燈，早就放着光亮，等候着照耀那些出臺的紅顏，咚咚鼓響以後，鬻歌的一般姑娘們，也就跟着鼓點，依着次序，每人出來歌唱一段，或靑衣，或老生，入面却不大聽得見。她們，聽說是很忙的，這裏唱完了，還要趕到別的地方去：也許是到另外一個淸唱的所在，也許就是趕到一個酒綠燈紅的舞塲，去等候她們的舞伴。她們燙着各種不同式樣的頭髮，穿着各種小同顏色的衣衫，和各樣的皮鞋，但是，又有一個時候，有一種東西，差不多可以說是她們每個人都不的而同的，留心的人們，這時候應該巳經知道了，那是什麼呢？就是每逢下雨的晚上，她們每個人脚上穿的套鞋，都是一樣的，這也許是因為她們沒有汽車的緣故。</p>
<p>大的經過不到一小時的光景，她們的歌喉就都潤過了，再要想聽的話，祗好明日請早，接着淸唱以後的節目，也有所謂—彩排，說個新一點的名字，就是化裝表演，這裏的演員，除了大的兩三個男角以外，都是女角，配搭起來，倒也說得上「齊整」二字，全本羣犬會，全本王寳釧，全本潯陽樓，探母回令等等重頭戲，她們也時常唱的，而且她們的所唱所做，也都是在學什麽梅呀，譚呀，金少山呀，如果閉起眼睛來聽，也許還會以為是梅蘭芳吧，程硯秋吧，譚富英吧……我有時會這樣想。別的觀客的心裏，那就各人有各人的趣味了。</p>
<p>這個劇塲的設備，當然不能和那些大的京劇塲來比，冬天沒水汀，夏天無冷氣，也沒有什麽樓廳，包廂，所以謂之「小型」。牠的票價，在以前最貴是九角，後來漲了一角，現在又漲了兩角，一共是八角。這當然又是米珠薪桂的結果，然而在各種生活程度昂貴之下比起來總還算是一個便宜的消遣所在。因為這個緣故，所以每晚都是滿座，道些觀客當中，捧角的，聽唱的，看做的，硏究板眼或胡琴的，形形色色各露出會心的微笑，至於這裏而的茶役，是沒有工資的，凡看見一個客人入塲，他們就在那兒侍候着，泡茶，打手巾，他們的生活也就靠着這樣的工作來維持他們的需求不大，不過是每人一角而已。照每大三四百觀客每人一角錢來計算，每月倒也有十千元的進賬，但是買買毛巾也就是他們的一筆大支出。</p>

<h3>糧食　因搬運致米價難平　但看洋米依然大批到來</h3>
<p>洋　米早市雖存多到湧、而市氣依然挺秀、蓋本化雖以取締而見懈、然內地淪域納胃不衰、而執貨者始終居奇、故黑市貼價不易抑低、小絞每白包又自三千七百元大至三千九百元、西貢一號自三千一百元至三千三百元、高三千五白元、又二號二千三百元至三千五百元、暹邏米三千二百元、但至午時客囤納胃巳衰、市略回平、午後因貨主借為號召之定貨問題、已有新成交妥議為之反設種種謠言之不確、人心頓時下向、浮囤力求脫手、市乃疲而無神、各檔貼價立時喊低一·二·三百元而仍乏受主、新成交計台義洋行拋出四月下期小絞一千七百五十噸、價一百甘九兀半、又達孚接洽之一批、價為一百甘六元者、因行情相差未能成議、但船運等均無間題也、全日洋米成交的一萬五千包、就到亦有一萬七八千包云、</p>
<p>厚　薄粳等國米、其來源薄稻較厚粳居多、不過難數仍屬不旺、而本鄕店舖銷塲繼續呆滯、致貨主仍難扳持、祇得甩價相邀、以是結果、薄稻計降二元有奇、開靑角斛見貨僅百十一元百十元、原包百十五元半百十五元、厚粳尙賴貨稀略貶元砠、若常幫斛見特粳百念二三元、高粳百念元、崑山斛見高粳百十七八元、大市百十四五元、次至百十元、原包百念五元、</p>
<p>糯　米難市貨無多、貨主尚無輕脫之意、奈如零諍去路、均見滯澀、市色難免略形帶軟、開香港特元百零七元、高百零五兀、大市百零一元、中次百零一元、一百元、糯茶特自九十七儿、次至碎九十一元、</p>
<p>洋　米湧旺到滬、怡和洋行明生輪前日（三十日）到埠、由香港裝來一萬一千四百八十四包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司廣東輪昨晨抵滬、由暹邏裝來八千一百包、經香港又裝來四千四百零三包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、查三月份洋米到滬、較一二兩月尤多、一俟算淸即行宣布、（祖）</p>
<h3>囤戶出籠　粉市不支下瀉</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉市况、巳呈不支之態、蓋自上週五一度提高後、實銷方面、因有平賣粉接濟、並不亟亟需用、更兼謠諑平息、及大批坎粉到滬後、人心終覺餒弱、囤戶遂有出籠、鐘樓牌澳粉開盤二十九元八九角、旋即鬆至二十九元六七角、金龍牌坎粉初開二十九元五角、旋亦鬆至二十九元二三角、比上週五回低七八角、華廠平賣粉仍為二十五元、由福新廠供給五千八百七十三包、其不足之數、則以抽提之洋粉補充之、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况毫無特色、杜麥有到兩少、間有零星到埠、大都供給日廠、因貨稀莫不扳持、價在四十五六元之間、而中塲買賣、依然無形停頓、</p>
<h3>糧雜　苞米供過於求　價跌達十元外</h3>
<p>苞米（玉蜀黍）市况、自上週初開始下瀉以來、其最高行情比現市相差達十元外、原因不外銷塲因路途時通時阻、捐稅繁重、致販運殊减、來源則反覺暢旺、（荷蘭貨昨亦運到萬外包）、現值大時不宜貯擱、囤戶奔潰、故人心氣餒、市風竟然一蹶不振、昨市在多頭亟謀塞出之情形下、期現貨一致猛跌三元左右、計成交西貢苞米一千五百餘包、價為銀棧三十四元五角至三十三元二角、本棧為三十四元八角、外棧為三十二元五角、訂三四月份交價為六十五元、荷蘭白苞米六車、價為三十四元二角至三十一元七角、黃苞米四車、價為三十四元七角、訂四月份交價為六十元云、</p>
<p>又昨日由靑島來豆餅五午張今（一日）有豆子四百六十包、並芝蔴七百十五包、蔴油三百聽、均運往杳港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球照常出貨　暗盤無形消滅</h3>
<p>煤球行情、前數日因發生工潮、各廠停正出貨、致一般柴炭店、憑少數存貨、門莊價格，私自更改、每担竟喊十三四元不等、趁火打刦、奇貨可居、但自日昨六大廠開工以後、照常出貨、故暗盤巳無形消滅、恢復常態、送到客戶、每噸兩百四十元、每担十二元，不得逾此定價、</p>
<h3>金融外匯供給較稀</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、九點三十分揭曉英美滙均放長〇六二五、英金三辦士一八七五、美金五元一八七五、法德無市、新荷未更外、港日等匯均放長、英美匯暗市、於交易淸稀中穩中反見帶軟、聞某銀行鈔票將於今日在本市流通、且進口商與華商投機家扒結、為數雖不巨、而外商銀行供力允薄、故美金五元三四三七五巳難結、英金亦緊至二辦士二五、下午起初華商少塞、勢見穩定、直至三點半、英行有利忽來吸進、投機家轉出、重趨緊勢、直至晚收、英金三辦士二三四三七五、緊〇三一二五、美金五元二八二五、軟〇六二五、交易平淡、</p>
<p>匯豐牌掛放長</p>
<p>晨初以海外匯兌、英對美對滬及美對英對滬等均吿勿動、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士二六五六二五、美匯五元三四三七五、較上週末均無榮辱、開後投機家稍有買意、四月期美匯五元三四三七五、思向外商銀行扒進、但有利某行均討價五元三一二五、致未成交、市面遂吿微緊、斯時間金三辦士二五、美匯五元三一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、除新荷外均放長、白銀平衡角揭曉、亦無升降、此後市况平靜、僅聞進口洋行現貨五元三二五、稍有扒進、及投機家亦曾結入外行四月份美匯五元三二五、嗣後交易更形沉寂、直至收盤、毫無生動、英金為三辦士二五、美匯為五元二一二五、</p>
<p>暗盤反見帶緊</p>
<p>後市初吿呆平、沙遜與華行稍有塞出、但英行有利頗有吃胃、成交過四月份美匯五元三一二五、迨三時半光景、市上忽有利多消息、投機商前來扒進、市勢吿緊、迨晚收現期英金均三辦士二三四三七五、美匯俱五元二八一二五、結果比上週末軋緊〇三二五及〇六二五</p>
<p>香港申匯上升</p>
<p>香港三十一日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤、英美日各匯俱無變動、申匯現金獨升二元、為四百六十元、十一時三十分吿平、申匯現貨升一元半、為四百六十一元半、下午二時二十分開盤吿平、各匯仍無上落、</p>
<p>天津英鬆美平</p>
<p>天津三十一日（週一）電、今表匯市開盤吿平、倫敦電匯鬆〇二一二五、為三辦士四三七五、紐的雷匯不動、仍開五元六二五、申匯升五角、為九十四元半、「聯鈔」暗般昂一角五分、為六十五元、</p>
<p>美票期貨步長</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價上漲雖鉅、然現金價則趨低、故英美金鎊僅各漲一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票步趨漲勢、晚市高至十八元六角九分收盤、（以上係期貨行情）、比上週六之現貨價軋升二角五分、香港票續趨漲勢、日金票及朝鮮票漲風未戢、前者退至一元九角七分、後者降至一元六角六分、</p>
<h3>買戶奮進　金市又向高峯進</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤、初時情况雖堅、但狀似徘徊、傍晚消息利多、傳「某行」鈔票將於今日在租界方面流通、滙市繪緊、激動買風、合盛大豐順源等奮起猛進、致晚收前陡漲至六千五百七十八元高盤、結果亦為六千五百七十四元、比上週六軋漲六十六元、全天交易平平、約計一萬五十兩、至三月期月底結價、照滙豐進口美滙五元三一二五結算、計合六千五百五十五兀三角交割、交易共一千零七十九條、現貨市勢疲落、現金步趨低落、先由同豐恒售予銀樓業一百兩、價照期交高一百八十元、繼見成記先出益大三十兩、繼售予聯興叫十兩、均高一百五十元、宏慶永出天元三十兩、高一百四十元、下午成記先出某號二十兩高一百二十元、又出立泰六十兩僅高一百十元、因祥興永又遂回上、進明豐一百兩高一百二十元、又進公大二十兩高一百三十元、比上日價的高十元、飾金掛小十元、後即日平、仍六百九十元、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲六十六元</p>
<p>晨初每條（十兩）開市告六千五百零五元、比週六計撳三元、嗣賴成記新豐永益大紛來收買、市勢步高、且不久滙巾報軟、祥和追跡在搜、雖斯時大豐恒記均有塞出、但散戶吃胃殊健、故頭寸仍感不敷、步升至六千五百四十元、旋買戶减少、德成天元同康永德孚等賣出、曾回小二十元、達六千五百一十元、奈滙市仍軟、散戶乘機冉進、加之未幾、大豐忽來在拖、而晋元成記亦不乏搜入、價遂又漲至六十五百九十五元、後以祥和多頭復出、益大大元亦賣、迨收盤回低十餘元、為六千五百三十八元、午後公和賣出、低為六千五百二十五元、但隔手三十元有人買進、後順源明豐撈人、抬至六千五百三十八元、而期時祥興永塞塞出復小至六千五百三十元、此後交易呆滯、上落極平、徘徊於六千五百三十五元左右、迫三時半後因有利多傳說、滙巾吿緊、遂激動買風、合盛育來扒進、繼之大豐鑫源順源等亦急來收買、迨收盤前升至六千五百七十八元、後成記拋出、曾回小八元、惟收盤尙有六千五百七十四元、結果比上週六軋漲六十六元、照美滙九元二八一二五結價、為六千五百九十四元一角、計撳廿元一角、塲外六千五百八十元、曾有成交、全犬七十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤（期貨）加高一百五十元、收進减小比賣價七八十元、現標金等無行無市、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金原盤未動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出上午十一時半掛小十元、迨傍晚叫時回高十元、結果大同行與新同行仍均懸六百九十元、收進减低四十元、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債盤旋待堅</h3>
<p>公　債暗盤、昨日市况盤旋帶堅、戌種因前已抬之甚高、丙種內多頭過於擁擠、故稍見米能振作、甲乙種為優、此因其在五種統一公債中為最優良、允推甲種為首、昨日交易仍未見興旺、同康·信孚於午前轉賣、大通·協康·亦有賣出、同順收進甲種不少、聯和收進乙種亦夥午牧市價略見疲軟、午後信孚·直康·忽又負進、仁豐吸收了種、四十一號買進亦不弱、惟裕興賣出戊種極湧、樂茂永昌賣出亦不弱、大都為丙戊兩種之多頭斬結、市價結果、高低互見、成交總數計共的一百八九十萬元茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>別類　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>股　票交易、成交世界書局股五十股、價為十五元止、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市開盤甚强、當日無大上落、祇會德豐股由一百十一元開盤漲至一百十四元收盤、上海企業股晨間祗做五元八角半、收盤時分急遽漲達六元一角半、各股俱甚活躍、但橡皮股仍少被人注意、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷終嫌不振紗市跌後轉漲　暗盤已出四百元外</h3>
<p>紗市始挫繼挺、且趨勢仍在徘徊之境中、實際交易絕少發展氣象、此乃各路航運綫困難、所以客幫採辦能力大受打擊也、於是空頭殊為活躍、至於多方、目下百物高昂、唯獨棉紗市價不振、吸收之額始終不棄、由此遂呈擯持之局不過存貨日增、銷路日蹙、長此下去、總不是根本解決、所以廠方將現貨價犧牲、使得現紗走動、存底减鬆、於市面當有益處也、二十支雙馬高價為一千三百九十九元、低價為一千三百七十九元、午後初做一千四百兀、跌至一千三百九十六元、繼聞金價上升、證券幫抵空、隨之高至一千四百〇四元半、最後為一千四百〇三四元之譜、今日有紗九百七十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市氣甚衰、因中新廠通吿各客家、對於變馬出貨啟事、限期自四月十五日以前出淸、否則每包加收棧租三元計算、由此浮多吐出、及搶帽子之流乘機賣出、故首盤開低為一千三百八十元、微小至七十九元、旋以證券幫扒空、檯吻轉穩徐徐回升至八十八九元、至九十元外、往返甚久、繼聞標金回昂、盈利者抵補、終續漲至一千三百九十九元、但實銷依然零落、又復回至一千三百九十五元、收盤價為一千三百九十七元、查牛日間成交統計七千〇四十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分外如左、</p>
<p>香港　九五　同行　六、七五〇</p>
<p>統計　七〇五</p>
<h3>棉市平淡無奇</h3>
<p>昨日棉市、因廠需呆滯、及執貨者以紗市良好、咸無意脫手、致交易消淡、昨共成交外棉八百件又本棉五百包、價漲一二元光景、茲錄成交行情如左、</p>

<p>科學</p>
<h3>長生不死的實騐</h3>
<p>— 默然</p>
<p>科學家早已知道人類死掉之後，身體細胞還可以活相當時候。然而，這種細胞到底能活多少時候，這個問題至今尙未獲得圓滿的解答。今年春間，柏林傳出一個驚人的消息，頗引起世人的注意；美國的科學家還不敢相信這個科學的解答，正在殷切的期待更完全的報吿。</p>
<p>德人的答案說：人體的細胞能够長生不死，至少在理論上是如此的。這是浦士格洛威茲敎授（Professor　P·Busse，Grawitz）在西班牙哥爾多華（Cordova）的日耳曼醫院做完一組實騐後所得到的結論。這位敎授在幾年前開始他的硏究，他把一些在酒精裏保藏三十八年的人體細胞放進一種滋養的液體裏，發見這些細胞「健辛的」成長起來。</p>
<p>浦士格洛威茲敎授推論說，生命的火焰如果可以保藏在酒精裏，或許也可以用其他的方法保存起來。於是他由六百年前葬在阿根廷石洞裏的印第安人的木乃伊屍體上，取出一些細胞。當他把這些細胞放進一種滋養的液體裏時，這些六百多年來沒有表現出生機的死細胞，據說居然開始繁殖起來了。</p>
<p>這位敎授作第二步的研究，他拿了一些世界上最古的人類細胞來實騐。他由十二個埃及木乃伊的身上取得一些細胞。這些木乃伊是五千三百多年前的死人，屍體已經完全乾枯而且開始分解了。這些久不活動的細胞放在各種滋養的液體裏之後，據說都開始生長起來。這種生長並沒有受過電流或化學藥品的刺激，可見道些細胞並沒有眞正死掉。所以，浦士格洛威茲敎授提出驚人的結論說，人類雖然會死，可是身體上的細胞，在事實上是不朽的。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>空襲與精神病</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>據精神病學專家白吉博士報吿，英國在遭德機空襲之前，一斑居民在神經上即顯出緊張狀態，這顯然係由於恐懼所致。迨經過多决空襲後，這種緊張狀態倒逐漸消除，因為人們對於空襲已經習慣，而患精神病的及有該病趨向者，都巳自動撤往他處去。上次世界大戰中，因刺戰而生精神病，本巳痊愈了的，這一來復發的也極多。</p>
<p>空襲的結果，更增加了許多精神病者，這班人並非庸人自擾，多係因極端恐懼驚險所迫成的。有一個婦人因弟婦被炸死，自己又險被炸中，於是人即昏迷，拳縮體僵，脈搏急促，經診治後甫能言語，然一聽到炸聲，精神病立即復發。一個十六歲的姑娘險被炸彈所中，受驚後四肢不能動彈，話都不會說了，用精神治療法治後漸愈，不過當時的情形她全忘了。還有一飛機內的職員，因遇到激烈的炸後，受驚過度，精神失常，他於是在倫敦各處徘徊着，有時隱藏在地道內，間時出來當衣服買東西吃。當送到醫院內去時，他人顯得極其疲乏，雙手抖顫，脈息急速，時時啼哭。</p>
<p>空襲造成的精神病患者，大的都是這一類的。在空襲道種威脅下，無疑的，一班健康的人可以變得精神反常，而那些原先巳患有精神病的，這一來更加嚴重了。</p>

<h3>自信的人有福了</h3>
<p>— 繼南</p>
<p>自信的人是值得人家讚美和欣羨的。脆弱的人，大多經不起最輕微的打擊。他們的希望，他們的幸福，他們的信仰，就在那些輕微的打擊可粉碎了。</p>
<p>自信並不是驕傲，但是自信的人只知道服從眞理。任何的阻碍，任何的打擊，任何嘲笑，任何的迫害，都消磨不了他的勇氣。眞理支持着他，他才有抗拒一切的力量。眞理給自信的人引路，那怕前面守候着饑餓，痛苦，嫉妬，憎恨甚至死亡，他也昂起頭堅定地走去。</p>
<p>在自信的人看來，眞理就是上帝。</p>
<p>自信的人愛眞理像愛他的生命審一樣，但是在生命和眞理不能兼顧的時候，生命就是變得無足輕車了。因此，自信的人常常犧牲了他們寳貴的生命，在眞理的面前低下了他們沉重的頭。</p>
<p>固執，驕傲，自以為是輕視自己以外的一切，這些都不能稱作自信。愚蠢的人是這樣的，然而自信的人決不如此，只有當眞理被他緊緊地握住後，他才會固執起來。</p>
<p>自信的人決不拒絕他人底意見和勸吿，只要是和眞理一致的，他都願意接受。</p>
<p>過去許多偉大的發明家和思想家底堅强的自信，常令人萬分感動，他們被自信帶走了自己的幸福，自信使他們在嘲笑和迫害中度過一生，自信使他們的生活變成了苦刑，他們的一生只是一個不斷的反抗奮鬥和掙扎，但是世界上還有什麽人比他們把一生的幸福獻給人類更高貴呢？還有什麼人能比他們當他們的理想實現了時感到更大的快樂呢？</p>
<p>自信的人有福了！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）　愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>秋海棠把身子更向右邊旋過了一些，臉對着東墻，昂起了半顆頭，眞的開始唱起來了：</p>
<p>「黑夜裏悶壞了羅士信。西北風，吹得我，透甲如冰。耳邊廂，又聽得，董鈴振。想必是，那蘇烈，發來兵……。」</p>
<p>這是一段姓姓調，在舞台上的時候，慣常都用鎖吶胡琴合配，調門非常的高秋海棠起初原是竭力把嗓子壓低了唱的，但唱了兩句就按不住了。湘綺聽他唱得那末響，雖然知道那個啞丫頭還是聽不見的，可是兩邊的訊居，似乎也不得不有所顧忌，心裏原想止住他，却又不願打斷他的興趣，而且那樣淸潤嘹亮的歌聲，聽在耳朶裏也委實很美妙，便依舊默不作聲地傾聽着。</p>
<p>「沒有胡琴戲就唱不好。」唱完了一大段二黃原板，秋海棠便旋過身子來搖着頭說。</p>
<p>湘綺又向他笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「你說我究竟唱得好不好？」秋海棠就在椅子的右邊，蹲着仰起了臉向她看，雙手牢牢地攀住椅子的扶手。「別人的話我不相信，大概你總可以老老實實的給我說一聲吧？」</p>
<p>「好是眞好！可惜祇有我一個人聽見，也沒有人給你喝采。」她微俯着上身，很放任地讓目己的視綫和秋海棠的視錢不偏不倚的對流着。</p>
<p>「那個要人家喝采？還是你好好地獎我一獎吧！」他男敢地把雙手往上」伸，拍着湘綺的肩頭。</p>
<p>「你要！獎些什麼呢？」（六九）（第五章完）</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>吃肉</h3>
<p>— 咪咪</p>
<p>「哀莫哀於吃菜，樂莫樂於吃肉，允其是吃羊肉。」弟弟在吃飯時候時常打笑着說；我們一家老小全都愛吃肉。</p>
<p>弟弟生日的一天。飯桌上放着許多小菜，內中有一盆肉，一只蹄膀，一碗牛肉湯，大家吃得津津有味的當兒，弟弟舞動竹筷，眉揚眼笑地說：「今天的羊肉味道眞好，沒有錢，當了褲子也要買來吃。」弟弟的話風擊出了一陣笑浪。</p>
<p>「你如果沒有錢的時候，眞的會當了褲子買肉吃嗎？如果眞的，那才算言行一致。」姊姊的挑撥性的話直刺進弟弟的耳朶里。</p>
<p>倔强的弟弟雖然覺得自己是說說玩的，但不予姊姊一個還擊似乎很「丟臉」，於是他頑皮地高興地說：「當然這樣。」知己知彼的姊姊早巳料到弟弟的還擊，所以回話早已掛在嘴脣皮上，一待弟弟說完，她的話立刻從脣上跌了出來：「如果眞的這樣，那麼你一定有當褲子的一天，而且時間是在不久，你想前年肉賣一元四斤，去年就賣一元二斤，今年就只能以一塊洋鈿買半斤，到今年年底恐怕要漲到一元一兩。開年呢？或許會成有價無貨，即使有也是貴得要你當褲子。」</p>
<p>這一來，弟弟似乎已被趕到山窮水盡的地步，大家的眼睛又射上了弟弟的窘臉。靈機一動，弟弟的臉轉窘為喜，「你說肉會一天貴一天，而實際上肉只會一天便宜一天，如果你要請我道出所以然，那麼明天得請我看電影戲。」弟弟的關子倒難為了姊姊，好得姊姊是位影迷，很容易地答應了條件，並且她也反提出說，「如果說不出究竟，你得請我看。」「當然」弟弟不加思索地說出。</p>
<p>「擦」的一聲，第弟躍出了坐位，直到寫字檯上，寫了一張證明書，自己簽了字，姊姊也簽了字，弟弟的態度活像一個魔術師，他向每一個人的臉上打量了一轉，於是在褲袋里掏出一張法寳，這是前天在酒館里拿到的宜傳品—嚮導社傳單，「能唱中西名歌，歌喉婉轉，能跳交際名舞，香艷肉感，可愛美麗，保君滿意……每小時一元，紅星每小時三元。」姊姊伸長的頭縮回了，「這是一個例子，還有隔壁三層擱上昨天生了一個女孩子，今天早上就分文不取地送給人家……」弟弟得意地又帶着憐憫地說着。</p>
<p>「河水小涉井水，你說得文不對題，你輸了。」她似乎聽得有點不甘心，所以說出這樣的話。</p>
<p>不待弟弟反抗，我就捷嘴先聲，一影戲的事暫時丟開，姊姊弟弟都是勝利的，都說得不錯，姊姊說的是物價飛漲的一環，弟弟說的是針對着每一個女子切身有關的女子解放問題。這一張嚮導社的傳單，便是婦女在社會上的縮影，幾千年的人類歷史的字縫里，刻劃着女子受壓迫被當作「賤貨」。說句公平話，我寗願做妓女而不願做一個封建勢力下的普通女子，因為前者是大衆的玩物，後者是私人的玩物和奴僕，這是實在的情形：是女子的恥辱，為了洗刷這種恥辱，惟有……」我正說得緊張的時候，姊姊打斷我的話說，「惟有不再糊裡糊塗，醉生夢死，惟有努力改變這種不平等的制度。」</p>
<p>「對」，「對」，大家默認着。</p>

<h3>戰時英國的劇藝</h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>久久不決的戰事，巳經把英國人完全轉變了，一個過去熟識英國的人，很難找到在現在她保存了許久的舊習慣。這種轉變，允其以戲劇方面為甚，有二萬五千個演員（戲電影馬戲等），巳經失去了他們的位置，接連的轟炸，使從前每星期賺一千鎊的演員，現在便肯以每星期十鎊的代價出賣他們的藝術。</p>
<p>在倫敦全區現在只有三個戲院，而且只演早塲。一個英國出名的戲業巨子巳經辭退了他的演員，而將戲院完全停閉起來，因此「全國劇影從業人員協會一不得不每星期拿出一千八百鎊來救濟一部份窮極的會員。最近該會巳經向政府請求，希望允許這些失業藝員，在公共防空壕或與國防有關的大集會裏參加表演。</p>
<p>倫敦最出名的二個劇團，Old　vic　players和Sadlers　wells　opera　Company最近巳在離開倫敦很遠的省份演出，譬如在蘭開夏；而以前這些地方，祗能聽到他們的名字罷了。它們的總部是設在一家紡織廠裏，這裏自然沒有倫敦那麼舒服，但是也得幹。在英國北部幾省，三十多年來從來不曾有過這樣好的表演，戰事巳經將高貴的戲劇平民化了。</p>
<h3>譚文塲中名琴手</h3>
<p>— 李雲影</p>
<p>戲班中塲面，向分「文」「武」行。如打鼓佬，大鑼，鈸，小鑼等均屬武行；而京胡，二胡，月琴，絃等則列為文行。武行中練習時，多由小鑼入手，决而鈸，繼而大鈸，再而打鼓，係步步遞升。文行中則不然，須視學藝之手音（即指音）如何，剛者多習京胡，柔者即學二胡，惟初入門徑時，咸令以操二胡隨之。曩年名琴師頗多，如梅大鎖（即蘭芳祖父），孫佐臣，李佩卿，陳彥衡等，均為當時聖手。現已先後逝去，晚近菊部人材吿乏，僅有數人尙堪一談，茲略述於後：</p>
<p>徐蘭沅　為常代伶界大王梅蘭芳之琴手，曾隨其出國獻藝。畹華之戲得力於彼頗多，即王少卿近年風頭雖較徐為盛，亦不過一時之興，究之蘭沅琴藝之精，當推為現代琴師之冠。頃因梅伶久居杳港，暫不出演，乃被平中某電臺聘為講述琴藝敎授。</p>

<h3>Domestic Righteous Ships Number Twenty-Eight; U.S. Orders Forced Seizure of German and Danish Ships in U.S. and Philippines, Also Under Guard; Other American Countries Will Adopt Similar Measures</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. government, acting on President Roosevelt's orders yesterday, seized a total of sixty-five German, Italian, and Danish ships berthed in the United States, worth thirty-six million U.S. dollars, and detained as many as two thousand seven hundred crew members. This action was taken under the World War espionage law to prevent foreign sailors from stirring up a major upheaval in the shipping industry. It is reported that ten of the sixty-five ships have already been damaged, and some may be beyond repair. So far, all the ships seen to be damaged are Italian ships. Whether German or Danish ships were damaged is still under investigation, so officials decline to comment. The crew of one Italian ship resisted the U.S. Coast Guard, and only yielded after a brief conflict. It is rumored that the U.S. had prior intelligence that the German and Italian naval telecommunications departments had issued secret orders to sink ships in North America and to immediately escape with those in South America. (31st International News Agency)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. government has forcibly seized twenty-eight Italian steamships and placed two German ships under guard to prevent damage in American ports. The Treasury Department first ordered the Coast Guard to board the ships to prevent the crew from damaging the vessels themselves. It is said that the ships were in a condition "close to sinking." Then, it ordered the Coast Guard to forcibly seize all Italian ships within U.S. territory. The Coast Guard in Boston has boarded two German freighters but has not confiscated them. The U.S. Army and Navy have also boarded the Italian ship Conte Biancamano (which used to sail to Shanghai and is now docked at the Panama Canal). The future disposition of these ships is still unclear. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau obtained presidential approval before issuing the order. The approximately 20,000-ton Conte Biancamano was seized by the U.S. Army stationed at the Panama Canal. Other Italian ships scattered in various U.S. ports are all ships of 5,000 tons. External reports state that if it can be proven that the ships have indeed engaged in destructive acts, they can be confiscated. Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented on this, saying that there is no international law that allows a government to confiscate and forcibly use foreign ships without paying compensation to the ship owners. Since the ships are accused of intentional acts of sabotage, he believes the government has the legal right to put them under guard, but should not have the right to confiscate them. Five Italian ships were placed under guard in the port of New York, and all crew members were sent to Ellis Island (i.e., the detention center of the Red Hook Port Immigration Bureau). Those involved will be prosecuted for sabotage. The Coast Guard's actions were swift and secret. Reporters and photographers were not allowed near the ships. This news was only obtained from official spokespersons in Washington, D.C., which came as a surprise to the diplomatic community. The Italian Embassy declined to comment. The naval attaché of the German Embassy only said, "Very interesting." (31st Associated Press)</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Twenty Italian ships are currently under guard by U.S. troops, including one named Biancamano, with a capacity of 23,000 tons, currently docked at Cristobal Port in Panama. There are also two German ships, one named Aralana, docked in Everglades, Florida, and one named Frederick, docked in Boston, both under guard by armed soldiers. Undersecretary of the Treasury Gaston stated that plans for self-destruction were discovered on the aforementioned ships, so troops were sent to guard them for protection. President Roosevelt has approved this measure. (31st Reuters)</p>
<p>MANILA - Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, announced today that the U.S. Navy, on behalf of the Coast Guard, has taken over and placed under guard four Danish ships anchored in Philippine territorial waters to prevent crew members from plotting sabotage. Fifteen U.S. naval officers have been stationed on each ship. Three of the four ships are in Manila Bay, and one is in Cebu. A naval bomber carrying naval officers flew to Cebu and boarded the Danish ship Mae Mersk. The Danish ships stationed in Manila Bay are Grete Maersk, Jutemersk, and Hilda Maersk, all new-style cargo ships that have been anchored there since June of last year. In addition, there are two other Danish ships in the Far East, one anchored in a Japanese port and one anchored in Dalian, both having sailed there to take refuge in April of last year. Currently, there are no Italian or German ships in Philippine territorial waters. It is understood that there was no difficulty in boarding the Danish ships. The detention of the Danish ships was carried out in accordance with orders from Washington. Reliable sources also recall that there had been attempts to take over these ships in the past few months. The captains and crews were willing to be taken over but refused to sail under the British flag. The U.S. State Department also did not approve of this move, as the U.S. government clearly wanted to handle all Danish ships anchored in U.S. territorial waters as a whole. (31st Associated Press)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Well-informed sources say that other American countries may follow the U.S. in placing German and Italian ships under guard to prevent damage to port facilities. The general opinion is that all Italian ships remaining in the Americas will ultimately be used to disrupt commerce between the American countries. Observers believe that the dictatorial countries knew in advance that the U.S. intended to seize their ships, so they planned to sabotage the ships. Japanese and German ships have already sailed out of Brazilian ports, largely because they anticipated that Brazil would follow suit. (31st Associated Press)</p>
<p>ROME - The Italian government has not commented on the U.S. seizure of German, Italian, and Danish ships in U.S. territorial waters. Italian newspapers have also not disclosed any news about this matter. However, several weeks ago, Italian officials and newspapers revealed that the U.S. seizure of Axis ships was highly likely, and warned that Italy would consider such a move a major provocation and would never allow it to go unanswered.

<h3>Kwong Bing-shun in Shaoquan; Visits Wounded and Sick Hospital</h3>
<p>SHAOGUAN - After arriving in Shaoquan, Councillor Kwong Bing-shun visited the Provincial Council, various departments of the Provincial Government, relief agencies, and military and political organs for days. This morning, he visited a certain hospital for the wounded and sick, donating two sets of general medical surgical instruments and a donation of five thousand six hundred yuan. Afterwards, he went to a certain place to visit officers and soldiers of a certain division, and presented the division's soldiers with consolation money. People from the Six Counties, the Lingnan University Alumni Association, and others held a grand banquet to welcome Mr. Kwong. Kwong will leave for the Fourth War Zone Commander tomorrow morning, and will return to Hong Kong and the United States within days. (31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Exported to the Netherlands East Indies; Expected to Sharply Decrease</h3>
<p>TOKYO - A semi-official Japanese source in Batavia said that the Dutch East Indies authorities' restrictions on imports in January of this year have meant that Japanese goods are not actually being granted exchange permits. Last year, the Dutch East Indies imported miscellaneous goods from Japan worth a total of 3 million guilders. However, because Japanese importers in Batavia cannot obtain exchange permits, the quantity for the 1941 fiscal year is expected to decrease sharply. It is heard that the reason is that the Dutch East Indies has decided to control imports, making them available to the pound bloc as much as possible so that foreign exchange in pounds stored overseas can be used. It is prohibiting the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods in order to promote local industry. (31st Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Elite Troops; Arrive in Singapore. British Strengthening Aimed at Defense; Black-Bearded Indian Soldiers Attract Much Attention</h3>
<p>SINGAPORE - The first contingent of British Army and Air Force troops sent from Britain to the Far East since the outbreak of the European war has now arrived in Singapore. This news was announced yesterday by Sir Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East. Sir Brooke-Popham said that the newly arrived army is mostly composed of famous Indian troops, including artillery, infantry, and mechanized units. Among the Indian soldiers are Punjabi soldiers and soldiers who believe in Islam, as well as those from northern and southern India. The Air Force includes several British fighter pilots known for their bravery. The great increase in a country's military strength in the Far East does not threaten others but is a force for stability and peace. India and Australia have both sent large armies here, and will continue to do so, in order to maintain the status quo in the Far East. The situation in other theaters of war is now improving day by day, so troops from distant places such as Britain can not only be transferred to serve in the Far East, but can also safely arrive here, even when British maritime communications are frequently attacked on the surface and in the air. This is gratifying. The troops arriving to reinforce are mostly those who have participated in battles, and have all kinds of latest equipment learned from the lessons of the first year of the war. Singapore Governor Thomas broadcasted last night, welcoming these reinforcements with warm emotions. When the Indian soldiers disembarked and landed with high spirits, hundreds of Indians on the pier cheered them. (31st Reuters)</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Air Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, announced that newly arrived reinforcements have recently arrived in Malaya, mostly Indian troops, with the remainder being British troops from the mainland and the British Royal Air Force. This is the first time that British troops from the mainland have been transferred to Malaya since the outbreak of the war. The garrisons previously sent here were all from Australia. According to the announcement, the Royal Air Force teams arriving in Singapore are all elite British pilots who are very experienced in European air combat. One person has received the Distinguished Flying Cross. The British military reinforcements include artillery, infantry, and mechanized units, all equipped with the latest equipment, and having experienced actual combat, they are the best troops for Malaya. Sir Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Malaya sincerely welcomes the new troops arriving here. We have no intention of attacking other countries, but we will certainly be able to defend our own land." Sir Thomas said that Malaya's food preparations are increasing daily, and the supply of other daily necessities is also very sufficient. Sir Thomas said after the meeting that the Federation of Malaya has organized a "Supply Department." The black-bearded warriors of the Indian troops who arrived here evoked feelings of great excitement. (31st Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Expected to Arrive in Rome Last Night</h3>
<p>ROME - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrived at Brennero, the border between Germany and Italy, from Berlin at 6:40 this morning. Many senior Italian officials and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Horiuchi were at the station to greet him. Matsuoka and his entourage then boarded the original train at 7:15 a.m. and headed here. He is expected to arrive here at 6:00 p.m. today. The entire city is now full of the flags of Italy, Germany, and Japan, ready to welcome him. (31st Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Commentator Advocates; Adjusting Japanese-Soviet Economy; Delusional Attempt to Get Involved in Siberian Resources</h3>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese political commentator Muto published an article advocating for the early adjustment of the Japanese-Soviet economy, so that Japan can utilize Siberia's natural resources, saying that if Japan and Siberia were in an economic group, Japan would be able to purchase at least 10 million tons of iron and millions of tons of oil from Siberia every year through barter. Since the world began, Siberia's treasures have not been developed, so its natural resources are limitless. The reason they have not been developed is simply because there is no financial capacity. But the Soviet Union is now making great efforts to accelerate the development of Siberia's resources, which Japan cannot ignore. Therefore, we regard the United States as a "country of today" and the Soviet Union as a "country of tomorrow," but the Soviet Union has now become a country of today. This is due to its efforts to develop natural resources. The Soviet Union's plan to develop natural resources is to quickly establish military industrial zones, in other words, to establish a highly organized national defense structure. The progress of the Soviet Union in completing its national defense structure is astonishing, not inferior to the United States. According to reliable statistics, the Soviet army in 1938 totaled 7.5 million, five times more than a decade earlier, but today the Soviet army is over 10 million. Its number of tanks has increased from 1,000 to 30,000 in the past decade, and aircraft have also increased from 3,000 to 30,000. It is heard that the Soviet Union now has 400 submarines, the most of any country in the world. If the Soviet Union has these three weapons, the Soviet Union can expand its military at an astonishing speed to a very high degree. It is because the Soviet Union is rich in natural resources. The more efficient heavy industry becomes, the faster the development of natural resources, and the stronger the power of its mechanized army. While Japan is focusing on the sea in front of its door, the extremely rich natural resources behind it are being developed at an accelerating pace. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Recaptures Fengxin; Jiangxi War Nearing End; Remnants of Japanese Army Completely Surrounded; Chinese Army Victorious on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Border</h3>
<p>CHONGQING - According to an official announcement here today, since the Chinese army recaptured Fengxin, a military town northwest of Nanchang, the Jiangxi war is nearing its end. Chinese military sources say that only a small Japanese squad remains in the area northwest of Guanqiao (transliteration), and it is said to be completely surrounded. There are no traces of the Japanese army near Gaoan, which was recaptured by the Chinese army. Saodang Bao (Sweep Away News) stated that the victory in the three provinces of Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Hubei indicates the growth of Chinese military strength and the Japanese army's inability to advance further. The Shih Shih Hsin Pao (China Times) said that this victory was an unexpected blow to Matsuoka's European trip. The Ta Kung Pao urged the British and Americans to pay attention to news from Tokyo, implying that the Japanese side might supply the German side with ships to attack British and American ships in the Far East. (31st Reuters)</p>
<p>CHONGQING - Military news: (1) On the Jiangxi northern front, a part of the Japanese army surrounded by the Chinese in the northeastern Guanqiao area retreated entirely on the 30th. Longtuan, after capturing Zhangzhu Town, Liyang, and other places, continued to pursue the Japanese army. The Chinese army has restored the situation of the 20th. (31st)</p>
<p>SHANGGAO - A certain commander told reporters that the great victory in northern Jiangxi this time has created a glorious victory, and its significance is fourfold: (1) It is a great victory after the Battle of Taierzhuang. (2) The annihilation battle in northern Jiangxi has been completed. (3) The frontal deployment of the Chinese army is perfect, completing the defense mission. (4) It proves that the Chinese army's combat power is strong. (30th)</p>
<p>SHANGGAO - In order to thoroughly clear the Japanese army from northwestern Jiangxi, the Chinese army killed many Japanese officers below the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Guanqiao area on the 28th. Afterwards, complete mountain guns, mortars, heavy and light machine guns, rifles, military horses, steel helmets, bullets, and countless other supplies were seized. (30th)</p>
<p>XIUSHUI - For several days, multiple Japanese military vehicles have been carrying wounded soldiers back and forth to Nanchang and other places. Also, many Japanese corpses have been transported to Anyi for several days, indicating the heavy casualties of the Japanese army. (30th)</p>
<p>CHONGQING - Military news: (1) The remnant Japanese troops in western Jiangxi braved the rain and fled east on a line from Guanqiao in two groups. The other group was the remnants of the Ikeda Brigade, close to a thousand people, and has reached Longtan. The last group was a thousand people from the remnants of the Oga Division and has reached Yanggongxu, and was then largely destroyed by the Chinese army. Only a few hundred people from the two groups escaped towards a certain direction. A certain Chinese unit is detouring to intercept them. (2) A part of the Japanese army is still in the northeastern Guanqiao area, heavily surrounded by the Chinese army. (3) There is no trace of the Japanese army in Gaoan city. (30th)</p>
<p>JINHUA - On the evening of the 23rd of this month, the Chinese army carried out a surprise attack on the Japanese-occupied stronghold of Sunjiaqiao (northwest of Hangzhou), killing many Japanese and destroying two bridges. (30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Qiongya; Defeated and Retreats</h3>
<p>SHAOGUAN - After the Japanese army committed atrocities in the villages around Hai Meng in Qiongya, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army could not support themselves and retreated. The Chinese army is still in pursuit. It is estimated that more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were wounded or killed in ten battles. (30th)</p>
<h3>China's Wartime Finance; Foundation Exceptionally Solid; Can Cope With Long War of Four Years; Issuance of Public Bonds Not Too Great Even After Several Days</h3>
<p>YANGON - Chen Bingzhang, secretary to Finance Minister Kung and director of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, who is currently inspecting the Yunnan-Burma Road as an administrator of the Executive Yuan, said that the Sino-Japanese War will not be decided on the battlefield, but on the financial front. If China is not capable of properly managing wartime finance, it will definitely not be able to fight so hard for so long. China has been able to properly handle major issues of wartime finance, so after fighting for nearly four years, the treasury has been able to cope with various expenses, and donations have not been excessively increased. The amount of national debt issued is also not too great, and its credit remains good. This is why Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France can provide huge loans. All of this was not only unexpected by the Japanese, but also surprised many neutral observers. (31st Reuters)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Expected Maturity</h3>
<p>While the "Democratic National Arsenal" is diligently working, the war situation in the Far East is as described in recent news reports from Chinese and foreign newspapers. Of course, this is not enough to determine the overall victory or defeat in the Far East, but there are still points that should be clarified.</p>
<p>The general public in China, due to years of experience in prolonged warfare, is no longer seeking excitement from the victories reported in war bulletins. Recalling the Battle of Taierzhuang, when the news of victory was first transmitted, the whole country rejoiced as if in madness. However, in the recent victory, the general public does not appear to be particularly happy. Instead, there is an unusual calmness, which cannot be underestimated as an improvement in attitude towards composure. Composure is the sum of understanding and confidence. Understanding that this is not the final victory; understanding that this is the prelude to the final victory that is being approached with confidence. There is not yet a general counteroffensive, and there is not even a large-scale local counteroffensive. Understanding that the launch of the general counteroffensive cannot be approached with impetuous impatience, but that there is indeed still something to be expected. Analyzing the war situation, whether in Jiangxi or in the Taihu region, both were simultaneous attacks by the Japanese with multiple lines of heavy troops. This fact, this dynamic, must be admitted to be the strategic initiative of this time is still on the Japanese side, not something that China wants to seize credit for. The Chinese army's initial abandonment and subsequent recapture of various places is not a second half that can be called a counteroffensive. It is actually China achieving such results through the use of mobile tactics for both of these local war situations from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The Japanese side also has its years of experience in prolonged warfare. On this occasion, there is a different characteristic from the past, which is silence. For four months, the two sides have continued to clash on various fronts, without stopping. But looking at the overall situation, it can be said to be a stalemate. During this period, Japan changed commanders-in-chief to an aggressive strategist, someone familiar with the war against China, this comes with ambitions and something to be done. After his arrival, in addition to South China, the most frequent dispatch of troops was in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. As a result, in Jiangxi and the Taihu region, there was a situation for four months that had never been seen on the various fronts. This is Japan's spring offensive, but this time it is proceeding in silence.</p>
<p>Now, the power of the Japanese should not be underestimated. It is still possible for them to launch another offensive at any place and season. But from the change of their commander-in-chief to this time's local warfare in two regions, it is not difficult to imagine the degree of sharpness. At the same time, the fighting power on the Chinese side, in addition to being tested and proven with each offensive, at least from the western bank of Taihu to western Jiangxi, this war clearly shows that the dissolution of the New Fourth Army did not affect the fighting power in any way. To say that the military discipline was rectified because of the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, which is why there are these achievements, or to say that there would have been even greater achievements if the New Fourth Army had not been dissolved, is superfluous speculation. As for inferring from the testing of the Japanese offensive the possibility of China immediately launching a general counteroffensive, the problem is no longer the strength of the Japanese army, which is strong and unbreakable, but the necessary tools needed for China's general counteroffensive, which have now been acquired. Therefore, if the conflict between China and Japan is not resolved by Japan changing its policy but must wait for war to make the final decision, then it must await the maturity of one of two focal points: one is that the strength of China and Japan, according to the original trend of waxing and waning, will eventually lead to a decisive battle; the other is the maturity of the "Democratic National Arsenal" to supply China with the necessary tools. The achievements in the recent war in the two regions are a brand-new fact that guarantees the inevitability of the two focal points.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Various Places in Southwestern Shanxi; Japanese Heavily Damaged Northwest of Fencheng; Japanese Northward Attack on Jishan Failed</h3>
<p>XINGJI - The Japanese army, which divided its forces to invade the southern section of the Lvliang Mountains in southwestern Shanxi, was intercepted by the Chinese army on the 27th, and fierce battles broke out. The fiercest battles were near Huanghuayu (northwest of Jishan). The Japanese eventually failed and retreated.

<h3>China and Britain Actively Proceeding with Construction: Yunnan Section of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Breaks Ground; Burma Border Section to Be Built Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: To promote Sino-Burmese trade and facilitate foreign trade, the Chinese government has been constantly negotiating with the British Burmese government on ways to improve Sino-Burmese transportation in recent years. Since the completion and opening of the Yunnan-Burma Highway in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], Sino-Burmese transportation has been greatly facilitated. However, highway transportation is insufficient. Therefore, the Chinese government plans to build a railway in Yunnan Province and has requested the British Burmese government to construct the section from Lashio to the border so as to connect it. The railway within Yunnan Province has now started construction accordingly. The British government has also agreed to the section on the British Burmese border, providing funding to assist the Burmese government, and it will be constructed soon. (31st dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Warship Searches French Merchant Vessel: Fired Upon by French Coastal Battery; British Ship Retaliates in Self-Defense; French Government Protests to Britain</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday morning in the Mediterranean, a British warship, exercising its legitimate belligerent rights, attempted to intercept and search four merchant vessels under French escort. It was fired upon by French coastal batteries off the coast of Algeria. The British warship then returned fire. A British Admiralty communique stated that as the British fleet was returning to Gibraltar, it was attacked twice by French bomber squadrons but suffered no damage or casualties. Upon receiving the news, British authorities learned that a French destroyer was escorting four French merchant vessels carrying important war materials destined for Germany, and would pass through the Strait of Gibraltar. They therefore ordered the British warship to intervene. The convoy passed through the Strait within Spanish territorial waters. The British warship waited until the French ships had left Spanish territorial waters and then ordered them to stop in order to conduct a search. The British warship was merely exercising its legitimate belligerent rights, but the nearby French coastal batteries opened fire. The British warship was forced to return fire. It was observed that the shells hit the coastal batteries. Given the actions taken by the French coastal batteries, the British warship had every reason to open fire on the French merchant vessels, but out of humanitarian considerations, it did not fire, and the French merchant vessels were able to enter the nearby Algerian port of Nemours. London sources disclosed that at least one of the four French ships was carrying rubber, which is in short supply in Germany. Responsible sources claim that at least one of the French ships sailed from Bangkok carrying rubber, which would certainly be transported across the Rhine into Germany. Britain has always fully maintained its right, in accordance with international law, to search ships suspected of carrying contraband to Germany. It has long been a well-known fact that French merchant ships carry various materials to major French ports, most of which are immediately requisitioned by the Germans. It is the opinion here that it is extraordinary that the French should fire on British warships when the British Navy is destroying French enemy Italian warships, and it reflects French policy. Furthermore, Britain has now expressed its willingness to slightly waive its international rights to allow some food to be transported into France to alleviate the suffering of the unoccupied zone of France due to German depredations, and it seems inappropriate for the French to take this action. The French explanation for this incident is: "At 7:00 am on Sunday, a large British fleet in French territorial waters between Nemours and Oran attacked four French merchant ships escorted by a French destroyer sailing from Casablanca to Oran. The convoy took refuge in the port of Nemours under the protection of its escorting vessel, coastal batteries, and aircraft. French aircraft retaliated against the aggressors and drove them away. The convoy was safe and unharmed." A French naval communique stated that the ships were carrying goods such as sugar and barley. Based on various evidence and the route taken by the ships along the Algerian coast, it is clear that the ships were transporting goods between the two French territories. The British cannot use the necessity of a blockade as an explanation for the British warship's "attack" on the convoy, because the purpose of a blockade is to prevent cargo ships from transporting food to belligerent countries. Therefore, the British warship's attack is unreasonable and inexplicable. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the artillery battle between the French coastal batteries and the British warship off the coast of Algeria, the French government has just released the following account of the incident: Four French merchant ships, escorted by a destroyer, sailed from Casablanca to Oran in accordance with non-belligerent practice. At 9:00 am yesterday, near the port of Nemours in the Mediterranean Sea, they were attacked by a British cruiser and four torpedo boats. Because it was close to the French coast, the coastal batteries retaliated. The French destroyer "Chemont" (1,310 tons) and the four merchant ships were able to safely reach the port of Nemours. The convoy was carrying goods such as rice, wheat, and sugar to Algeria. Sources here solemnly point out that the British fleet's action against non-belligerent merchant ships within French territorial waters is a violation of international law. (31st Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the British fleet's shelling of French ships off the coast of French Algeria in Africa yesterday, the French government has just lodged a protest with the British government. The protest was delivered to the American Embassy in France by Sidda. As for the rumors that the French ships were carrying military supplies and rubber to aid Britain's enemies, the authorities here have also solemnly denied this, saying that the ships were carrying 15,000 tons of rice and sugar, 1,500 tons of fresh vegetables and seeds, and 10,000 tons of barley.

<h3>British Air Raid Shelters Ordered to Be Rebuilt</h3>
<p>London: It was reported here today that Security Minister Morrison has ordered the demolition of hundreds of above-ground public air raid shelters in Britain because these shelters were built with inferior lime sand and cannot even withstand the climate. It is understood that the order was issued because many shelters had collapsed. The order will affect 500 air raid shelters in a certain town and nearly 60 air raid shelters near Birmingham, which can accommodate 3,000 people, as well as many air raid shelters in Bristol. Scott, the general manager of the London air raid shelters, told local authorities that the Minister of Home Security has decided that all local public above-ground air raid shelters built with substandard lime sand must be closed. Local authorities have been ordered to inspect all above-ground air raid shelters for defects. Newspapers this morning said that these air raid shelters were built 18 months ago at a cost of millions of pounds sterling, according to a plan drawn up by government experts. At that time, lime sand and cement were in short supply, but experts said that the substitutes, whose main ingredients were lime and sand, were as effective as cement. It is claimed that these air raid shelters cannot withstand the explosion of even small bombs that land a few yards away. An architect told a United Press reporter: "I have inspected hundreds of these above-ground air raid shelters. The protection against explosions offered by these shelters is no better than that of the most easily shaken houses." These air raid shelters will be rebuilt, but it is understood that there is still not enough proper cement available. The Cement Production Committee, led by Lord Reith, is discussing the matter with experts from the Air Raid Precautions Committee. The Committee has reported that the UK is well-suited to produce blast furnace slag cement to increase supplies, but it is reported that the cement manufacturing industry opposes the plan.

<h3>Britain Reclaims Farmland to Increase Food Supply</h3>
<p>London: British Agriculture Minister Hudson recently told a Reuters interviewer that Britain has reclaimed 4 million acres of new farmland since the outbreak of the war in order to make Britain self-sufficient in food. Farmers are working extraordinarily hard, converting private gardens and golf courses into farmland. The work of ditching and reclaiming wasteland is progressing rapidly. A very small number of lazy farmers have been eliminated, but the vast majority of the rural class are diligent. The Rural War Executive Committee, composed of farmers with the most experience, knowledge, and skills, can provide guidance to farmers. Before the war, there was a machine with 100 horsepower; today, there are machines with 1 million horsepower, and the government is now assisting with machines and financial resources. This spring, there are thousands of land reclamation team members, and the Women's Land Army now numbers 10,000. However, pig and chicken farming must be reduced, and even cattle must be reduced this summer. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

Explosions were also heard along the British coast of the Strait, and a large fire was seen in the direction of Calais. The clouds above Calais were reddened by the flames, and the flashes of exploding bombs and artillery fire from Calais to Dunkirk flickered. There were no air raid sirens in London as of late last night. A German aircraft sneaked into southeastern Scotland and dropped a bomb, causing no damage or casualties. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>War Should Be Eliminated in the Future World: Appeal by the British Lord Privy Seal</h3>

<h3>Five Italian Warships Sunk in British-Italian Naval Battle: London Announces British Fleet Suffered No Damage</h3>
<p>London: Judging from follow-up reports on the major naval and air battle between British and Italian warships in the Mediterranean, the British have inflicted a major blow on the Italians in naval warfare. It is now confirmed that five Italian warships have been sunk (three cruisers and two destroyers). The British fleet suffered no losses or damage. The sunken Italian warships include the 10,000-ton cruisers Fiume, Pola, and Zara, the large destroyer Gioberti, and the destroyer Maestrale. The above-mentioned cruisers were all equipped with 8-inch guns. The Fiume had eight 8-inch guns and a crew of 705 officers and men. The Gioberti was built in 1936, with a displacement of 1,700 tons and a crew of 157 officers and men. The Maestrale's armament is the same as the Gioberti's, but with a displacement of 1,500 tons. The Admiralty issued a simple communique last night, briefly stating that General Cunningham led the fleet to victory, and only said that according to a report from the headquarters of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, the British warships suffered no casualties or damage. The Admiralty also said that an Italian cruiser with 6-inch guns and another destroyer were almost certainly sunk in the battle, and several other warships were also heavily damaged. However, some British aircraft were lost, and a detailed report is awaited. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Admiralty has just released a battle report stating that at least one battleship, four cruisers, and three destroyers of the Italian fleet were sunk in the Mediterranean by our fleet. The severity of the losses is even greater than initially reported. More than 1,000 sailors from the various ships have been rescued by our side. Without the German aircraft bombing, another 200 to 300 could have been rescued. Two of these German aircraft were shot down and have been identified as Junkers. Rear Admiral Castoni, the commander of the Italian cruiser fleet, is currently missing. Captain Tesbici of the cruiser Pola has been rescued by our ships. Our Admiralty has notified the Italian General Staff by radio that there are many sailors in urgent need of rescue and has requested that a rescue ship be dispatched to the scene of the naval battle as soon as possible. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: This afternoon, the Admiralty's communique stated that it has now received a report from the Commander-in-Chief with more details on the operations in the Eastern Mediterranean. On March 27, reconnaissance aircraft reported that a squadron of enemy ships was sailing east off Cape Passero, south of Sicily. On the morning of March 28, our light warships discovered an enemy Littorio-class battleship and several cruisers southwest of Crete. At the same time, aerial reconnaissance also claimed that two enemy battleships were discovered north of the aforementioned location, accompanied by several cruisers and destroyers. After discovering that their whereabouts had been discovered, the enemy ships increased their speed and turned westward. Upon receiving this news, a squadron of the Greek Navy joined our fleet in deploying for battle. During the battle, our naval aircraft repeatedly bombed the enemy Littorio-class battleship with aerial torpedoes, with great success. The battleship was heavily damaged and its speed was greatly reduced. At that time, Royal Air Force bombers also cooperated in the battle, repeatedly hitting Italian cruisers and destroyers with bombs. The enemy ships' speed was sharply reduced due to the air strikes. Our heavy warships were able to catch up and make contact. Unfortunately, darkness was approaching when the close-range battle occurred. Our battleships and light warships joined the battle and sank the Italian 8-inch gun cruisers Pola, Zara, and Fiume, the large destroyer Gioberti, and the destroyer Maestrale. In addition, one destroyer and the 6-inch gun cruiser Baonier may also have been among those sunk. Several other enemy ships were damaged, but due to the darkness and the speed of the battle, the details could not be confirmed. In the naval battle on the morning of March 29, a large number of light fighter bombers and two oil tankers were destroyed. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Communique</h3>

Another submarine sank two large enemy oil tankers, totaling 18,000 tons. In the second half of March, German aircraft bombed a British convoy near Crete with considerable success. On March 18 and the 24th, German aircraft again bombed the British Navy near Crete. This was the seventh time that German aircraft had bombed British merchant ships and the navy in Cretan territorial waters, striking at Britain's important transport lines in the Eastern Mediterranean. On March 29, a British aircraft carrier was hit and severely damaged, causing another major blow to the British Navy. (31st Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Eden Returns to Athens: British and Greek Continued Discussions to Prevent War from Spreading to the Balkans; South and Turkey also Discussed Defense Agreement</h3>
<p>Athens - British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial Army Chief of Staff Dill have returned to Athens to continue discussions with the Greek government, with the aim of preventing the war from spreading to the Balkans. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Istanbul - It is believed that diplomatic negotiations were held in Ankara yesterday, and as a result, Turkey and Yugoslavia may conclude a defense agreement. Yugoslav Ambassador to Turkey, Schmanovich, had a lengthy conversation with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. It is rumored that this is a precursor to Yugoslavia accepting Turkey's proposal from several months ago. Reliable sources say that Turkey proposed that Yugoslavia and Turkey establish a tacit understanding regarding the joint defense of their borders. It is reported that the Yugoslav envoy will soon depart for Belgrade. Well-informed sources believe that Turkey did not promise any binding commitments other than military actions for defense during its negotiations with Yugoslavia. Observers say that as a result of the negotiations in Ankara, Yugoslavia and Turkey may jointly issue a statement, and Greece may also join later, forming a Yugoslavia-Greece-Turkey defense group.

<p>Yugoslav Capital - Responsible officials here recently stated that although a coup d'état occurred in Yugoslavia on February 27, it will not affect the country's attitude towards international events.

According to political figures, Yugoslavia will avoid taking any action to change the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula. In essence, the Yugoslav government remains determined to stay out of the conflict and abide by its international obligations. It is rumored that Yugoslavia will soon conduct negotiations with the Turkish government, but this seems premature, as the government is currently focused on domestic affairs and has no time for this.

<h3>British Forces Advance Rapidly in Africa: Pointing Directly at Asmara, Capturing Over 3,000 Italian Soldiers; Tegart Visits Keren to Boost Morale</h3>
<p>London - London newspaper commentators recently predicted that the British could occupy the entire Italian East Africa before the rainy season in mid-April. The Daily Telegraph stated that popular resentment in Italy is increasing, but because German troops occupy key locations in Italy, there seems to be no sign of an open revolution. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Cairo - A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from Keren that the British Imperial Forces, aided by a unit of Free French forces, are rapidly advancing towards Asmara (the capital of Eritrea). To date, the British forces have captured 3,775 enemies, including 68 officers, and seized many cannons. At the same time, the Italian side admitted to withdrawing from Dire Dawa (a key city on the railway from the Abyssinian capital to Djibouti) in Abyssinia, but it is reported that the British forces have not yet occupied the city. The British recently announced that the British forces advancing from Harar are now on their way to directly take Dire Dawa. All the army concentration cities and repair plants on the railway from the Abyssinian capital to Djibouti are in Dire Dawa. The Reuters correspondent also stated that the British forces advancing towards Asmara are fighting against the enemy troops who are defending the area based on the dangerous terrain. The enemy is using mountain road obstacles to resist the British forces. The road leads to a steep ridge, and there are ridges on both sides of this ridge. After the British artillery bombarded fiercely for ten minutes, the Indian army attacked the two ridges held by the Italian army in the battle cry of "God Grants Me Victory" and successively occupied them in a few minutes. The Reuters correspondent encountered a unit of Free French forces on the way. They had just rushed from the rugged countryside in the north, traveling 75 miles in 24 hours, in order to intercept the Italian army, but because the main force of the Italian army withdrew extremely quickly, they did not have time to intercept them and only captured some enemies. As the British forces advanced rapidly towards Asmara, all the obstacles built by the enemy when they retreated were blown up one by one by Indian sappers. When the Italian army retreated, they used gunpowder to violently blast the mountainside, causing rocks to pile up and block the road to prevent the British forces. Furthermore, there were Italian machine guns on the surrounding heights to cover the obstacles. The British side then sent infantry to clear the machine gun positions, and the sappers immediately blew up the piles of rocks on the road or paved roads on the piles of rocks. The work was quick, and the British forces were able to advance rapidly. According to recent news, the major obstacle 40 miles from Asmara has been cleared. A military spokesman disclosed yesterday that one-third of the enemy troops captured in Keren were Italians, and the rest were native soldiers. The number of Italian soldiers killed or seriously injured reached five to six thousand. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<h3>US Plans to Lease British Merchant Ships: Over One Hundred Ships</h3>
<p>New York - The Commercial Daily recently reported that, according to the most reliable sources, the number of American merchant ships prepared to be leased to Britain is between 120 and 145. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>European War: A Review of the Western Front</h3>
<p>The German army also made a showing in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands and the location of the Dutch General Staff, in the same way. However, the paratroopers' attempt to drive out the Dutch army in the town of Eben-Emael, three miles southeast of The Hague, failed. After the transport planes landed, the German troops crawled out of the planes and were met with machine gun fire. In Delft, the transport planes all landed on the highway, and as soon as the troops landed, they sacrificed themselves by deliberately driving into the trenches, giving way for the remaining planes to land. They blocked the main road leading to The Hague, intercepted Dutch vehicles coming and going, and carried soldiers forward to The Hague. On the Waalhaven side, airborne marines landed continuously to reinforce the paratroopers who had occupied the bridges of Moerdijk and Dordrecht.</p>
<p>The audacity of the German troops participating in the "vertical encirclement" was truly astounding. The number of people they landed was small, and the landing site was 70 or 80 miles away from the German front line held by two Dutch divisions. They relied entirely on the rapid arrival of ground infantry and the swift occupation of the important bridges on the Maas River to avoid annihilation. If they could have attacked and occupied the Dutch capital, the entire nervous center of the Dutch army would have become temporarily ineffective, and the Dutch army's resistance would have collapsed immediately.</p>
<p>Led by countless dive bombers, the German army rushed towards the border at dawn. The Dutch border guards retreated to both sides without a fight. The German army advanced, and by the afternoon, the vanguard had reached the main defense line on the northern Grebbe line. On the southern Peel line, the Dutch army was blocked by the Fifth Column wearing Dutch gendarmerie uniforms and failed to destroy the important bridge across the Maas River in Gennep. Although the German army lost a armored train, it still surged forward, and by noon had reached the first defense line of Mill. Another division crossed the Maas River south of Roermond. On that day, the German infantry advanced 15 miles on the Grebbe line, and the German troops who crossed the Maas River south of Roermond further threatened the flanks of the Peel line. Only the German troops landing in The Hague were mostly surrounded by the Dutch First Army. The Dutch government urgently appealed to Britain and France for assistance.</p>
<p>At noon on May 11, 300 paratroopers suddenly landed in a wooded park in The Hague, only one mile away from the Dutch Parliament. Another team of paratroopers landed only five houses away from the Dutch Royal Palace, undoubtedly trying to kidnap the royal family. At the same time, an armed Fifth Column also attacked the police headquarters. Then street fighting broke out. Fortunately, with the help of light tanks, the Dutch army fought hard for an hour and a half before repelling the German troops.</p>
<p>The overall situation was beyond the expectations of Dutch Army Commander General Winkelman. Some of his troops were attacked by the enemy from both sides and even forced to fight on both sides. German paratroopers landed less than a mile from his headquarters, and in fact, street fighting was taking place outside his building. In Rotterdam, 12 miles away, a large team of airborne marines also landed. The Fifth Column constantly fabricated news to his headquarters, and it took a long time to distinguish the truth from the false. The only guarantee that the headquarters would not be bombed was due to the German diplomatic personnel stationed in the Netherlands who remained across the street. At this time, the Netherlands was in extreme danger and could only be saved by foreign aid. On that day, a division of French motorized troops and a division of tanks moved north and stopped at Breda. If this force could be used actively, it would not be difficult to wipe out the German troops in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>On May 12, the German army continued to advance. The German mechanized division on the Peel front line advanced 20 miles and reached 's-Hertogenbosch. Nearly 10,000 German airborne marines had landed in Waalhaven, and they also found pre-hidden cannons and heavy weapons in yachts parked in the Maas River. One of the transport planes flying to Waalhaven was shot down en route, and it was even carrying the warhorse that the division commander was riding.</p>
<p>On May 13, the war was still one-sided. The area in front of the Grebbe line was not flooded, either because of the sabotage of the Fifth Column or because of being caught off guard. The dikes that the Netherlands had once boasted of were of no use at this point. German armored units broke through the Peel line in 's-Hertogenbosch, passed through Moerdijk, and by 4 pm, had made contact with the German troops in Dordrecht. However, if the French army in Breda had made an effort to break through the German mechanized troops from the side, it would not have been difficult to undermine their "vertical encirclement" strategy. However, the French army did nothing under continuous aerial bombardment. The Dutch army had been cut in two and was in danger of being completely wiped out. Most of Rotterdam had been reduced to ashes, and the German air force here had also made contact with the mechanized troops. The French army in Breda retreated south, and on the 14th, General Winkelman surrendered on his own authority.</p>
<p>The Dutch battlefield troops suffered only 23,000 casualties and did not collapse, and a large part of them were not mobilized, but the Dutch army was completely in chaos, and annihilation was inevitable.</p>
<p>At this time, the German army and air force also began to attack Belgium. It is estimated that their air force fleet numbered between 500 and 650, and there were between 7,000 and 10,000 fighters. Although the total number of Allied aircraft was no less than this, with a total of 400 fleets and 6,000 fighters, their command was not unified, and their actions were difficult to coordinate.</p>
<p>The German air force swept away the Dutch and Belgian air forces from the beginning. The Allies mobilized 100 bombers between May 10 and 14, supplemented by fighters, for sporadic counterattacks, but the German air force crushed them. In a battle near Sedan on May 14, 40 of the 95 British aircraft were lost in one go, and 35 of the 65 British aircraft were lost in another. Since May 14, the Allied forces had virtually no ability to bomb during the day.</p>
<p>Although the German air force was extremely important in terms of attack, the victory could not be determined without land forces occupying the positions. These troops were all carefully selected elite troops who had received special training in siege warfare. In fact, the Allied defense fortifications had all been photographed by them, and the German army had made models in the country for field exercises. Once they were in the situation, they could naturally handle it with ease. Each German attack was carried out by smaller detachments, led by a strong and resolute commander. They were equipped with all kinds of necessary weapons, such as wire cutters, hand grenades, explosives, axes, shovels, compasses, sandbags, automatic pistols, light machine guns, smoke bombs, etc., just like a mobile hardware store. Under the cover of artillery fire and smoke screens, they crawled towards the fortifications, and bullets were accurately fired at the embrasures of the bunkers. As long as a hole was cut in the barbed wire, the commander and several experts would run forward quickly and rush to the "dead corner" under the observation hole, and the rest would also spread out towards the rear and flanks of the fortifications. They threw hand grenades into the bunkers through the embrasures. If the embrasures were blocked, they would use bombs to destroy the bunkers. Sometimes they also used flamethrower tanks to attack.</p>
<p>Fort Eben-Emael, located on the Albert Canal defense line, was known as the strongest fortress, with walls 120 feet thick and surrounded by the quarter-mile-wide Albert Canal on all sides. However, the soldiers who were ordered to destroy the two bridges on the canal had been killed, and the German army rushed across the two bridges and attacked the fortress from behind. An aircraft, towing several gliders, full of suicide squads, landed on the open ground in the fortress. They had practiced in Poland long ago, and at this time they imitated it, jumping out of the aircraft one by one, each performing their duties, some using hand grenades to blow up the doors, and some throwing bombs from the vents. In the midst of the panic, the Belgian army raised their hands in surrender.</p>
<p>The British and French armies, which had been waiting in full force in northern France, had now entered Belgium, willing to fight a decisive battle with the German army, but unfortunately their actions were too late. German paratroopers landed one after another along the Albert Canal and in Luxembourg, shaking Belgian morale. The key town of Liège fell on May 13, and the German army left a small team to besiege the forts that had not yet surrendered, while the main force continued to advance. Generals Reichenau and Kluge commanded the Sixth and Fourth Armies to expand the gap in the Albert Canal line and reached the banks of the Maas River between Namur and Dinant.</p>
<p>The German plan was proceeding perfectly. The Allied forces saw that the German offensive towards Belgium was extremely sharp, and could not help but be fooled, thinking that it was still Schlieffen's original plan, so they drove their troops north. At this time, the opportunity for the main attack had arrived, and on May 14, the German army used all its strength to rush south to Sedan. The German army deployed in depth along this road was no less than 70 divisions. Before the infantry attack, 1,000 dive bombers were used to bombard the French forts for 25 consecutive hours. The German infantry engineering assault teams then advanced and broke through the defense line. It is generally believed that the German army's breakthrough of the French defense line was due to tanks, but in fact it was the credit of the assault teams. After the defense line was broken through, the German armored divisions rushed in like a flood from the gap. From then on, everything was over. The French army had been defeated and could not regroup. Its Ninth Army, under the command of General Corap, fought bravely, but eventually the entire army was annihilated.</p>
<p>The German army's full use of this breakthrough is truly remarkable. In the last World War, both sides often broke through enemy lines, but failed to take the opportunity to create a strategic victory. This was a major mistake. The German strategy around Sedan was simple: to form a spearhead with motorized vehicles, light and heavy tanks, and aircraft, led by a commander who was solely responsible for command on the ground. They simply moved forward in a mighty manner, not bothering to consolidate the positions they had gained. The tanks destroyed the bunkers and machine gun nests, and if they were blocked by flat-trajectory guns, other tank teams would surround the enemy's rear and attack from both sides. Sometimes this task was performed by motorized units, and sometimes the tanks used radio to ask the bombers for help.</p>
<p>All German tanks, numbering between 7,000 and 7,500, were formed into ten armored divisions. In addition, there were six motorized divisions. The tanks were equipped with flat-trajectory guns, and as soon as French tanks resisted head-on, they were immediately destroyed. The German armored convoys still used the old strategy of concentrated attack and surprise. They were extremely brave, disregarding everything. Their reconnaissance convoys avoided combat and rushed straight through the rear of the demoralized French army. The speed of their advance often prevented the French army from blowing up the bridges, and they were able to seize the road and pass.</p>
<p>The German army supported from the rear, first with motorized units, followed by infantry advancing at a rapid pace. The mechanized division averaged 25 miles a day. After they penetrated deep into the enemy's rear and occupied the towns, they always destroyed the telephone traffic. Their slogan was speed. On one occasion, 50 German soldiers driving three light tanks stalled 1,500 Allied transport vehicles for a long time. When they passed through a mine-strewn battlefield, they first bombarded it with fierce artillery fire, or secretly buried trigger nets at night, so that they would explode just before the tank attack, opening up the advance route. When they crossed the fortified rivers in rubber dinghies, they often used smoke to cover them.</p>
<p>Although the Allied forces in Belgium retreated to the Dyle River on May 15 and then retreated to the Dender River on the 16th, they retreated in an orderly manner. How did they know that the main German force was south of them, advancing westward behind the Little Maginot Line, sweeping through Sedan, Mézières, Gas, Saint-Quentin, and heading straight for Amiens and Arras!</p>
<p>Although the British Expeditionary Force and the Belgian army were under less pressure in the north, they were also forced to retreat to the Scheldt River. By May 21, the German breakthrough point had expanded to Abbeville on the English Channel coast, and the Allied forces north of this point were completely isolated.</p>
<p>At this time, if the Allied forces had equipment similar to the German army, the position of the German army would be very dangerous. The Allied forces could attack from both sides and reach the coast, smashing the German army trapped in it. However, because of the disparity in the strength of the equipment, it was not the German army that was in absolute danger, but the Allied forces.</p>
<p>The French army counterattacked near Montcornet and Valenciennes on May 20 and 21, but they failed. On May 22, the German army concentrated all its tanks again, wanting to break through a point near Arras, but it was too late and too weak to succeed. Other attempts, such as the one in Cambrai on the 23rd and the one near Amiens on the 24th, were also in vain.</p>
<p>The British army had sensed the situation and began to retreat to the ports on the Channel, planning to board ships and return home, but the German army had already copied along the coast, wanting to completely close off this triangular area. From then on, the Battle of Flanders became a siege on both sides of the triangle. The Belgian army was isolated and helpless, so they surrendered on May 28. The British army's left wing was empty and too threatened. In fact, the British army had already begun to retreat on May 26. By the 29th, 80,000 people had been rescued by ship.</p>
<p>The German army fully expected to wipe out the isolated Allied forces, but at this time Britain had gathered all the aircraft from the bases on the other side of the Channel, while the German army used most of its air force south of the Somme River to prevent the French main force from counterattacking, giving the British army a sudden temporary local air superiority.</p>
<p>The British army also had the help of the weather, the Channel was shrouded in thick fog, and 665 ships were able to transport 110,000 troops across the sea to return home within two days. In the next four days, another 160,000 people were rescued.</p>
<p>The Battle of Flanders was one of the greatest tragedies ever played out. It ended with this declaration, and the war situation on the European continent was completely out of control.</p>

<h3>Number of Seats for Shanghai Municipal Council Directors: Negotiations Still Not Fully Resolved; Senior Consul Announces Postponement of Elections; Relevant Parties Remain Silent</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council, "Senior Consul Hill recently announced that the election date for this year's Shanghai Municipal Council directors and land commission members, previously set for April 22nd and 23rd, is now cancelled. The election is postponed, and the deadline for receiving candidate nominations is also postponed." It is understood that the election for this year's council directors was originally scheduled for April 22nd and 23rd, but due to insufficient consultation among the relevant national expatriate groups, the consuls approved a postponement to April 29th and 30th. Subsequently, the British, American, and Japanese consuls-general engaged in negotiations, proposing changes to the ratio of council directors. Furthermore, the leaders of the British and Japanese expatriate communities, Keswick and Watanabe, also orchestrated behind-the-scenes negotiations, intending to establish a "gentleman's agreement" to increase or decrease the number of directors. However, to date, no resolution has been reached. According to the Land Regulations, the council director election can only be postponed once, without further extensions. Now, with another indefinite postponement, it is evident that the three consuls' negotiations have encountered difficult-to-resolve obstacles, symbolizing significant changes in this year's council director election. People from all walks of life attach great importance to this, but relevant officials remain tight-lipped, refusing to make any relevant public statements.</p>
<p>Whether a Compromise Has Been Reached is Unknown</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reported that "as of this morning (March 31st), the Shanghai Municipal Council director election remains shrouded in mystery. It is said that the meetings of the British, American, and Japanese consuls-general to revise the ratio of council directors have not reached a compromise, and officials are still not disclosing anything. As for the list of British directors already nominated by the expatriate community, the Municipal Council remains silent today and has also not announced whether it has received the list of Japanese director candidates. It is understood that the deadline for the nomination of next term council directors is set for noon tomorrow (April 1st). To date, only the American director candidates have been disclosed, namely Messrs. Allman and Bland. It is rumored that all five nominated British directors are incumbent directors. The names of the Japanese director candidates remain unknown."</p>
<p>Reasons for Postponement: Various Rumors</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "New Voice" reported that a reporter, after consulting with well-informed sources, learned that the most likely reasons for the repeated postponement of the council director election are as follows: (1) The Japanese taxpayers lack leadership talent internally, and opinions cannot be unified. The influence and talent of the current chairman of the expatriate community, Watanabe, is not as great as Hayashi, and he cannot command popular support. Therefore, the negotiations between Watanabe and Keswick have not been successful. (2) Among the British and American expatriate communities, there is generally more opposition than support for changing the ratio of council directors, causing some negotiators to feel they lack popular support. (3) If the number of Japanese and American directors is to be increased, then the respective national expatriate communities must convene meetings to formally nominate candidates, which cannot be done in the short term. (4) If council directors are to be added from other nationalities (other than British, American, Japanese, and Chinese), then the consular body must first obtain the consent of other expatriate communities before a decision can be made, which is also time-consuming. Based on the above reasons, the further postponement of the council director election is quite reasonable. However, the date of the taxpayer annual meeting is April 17th and will not be changed, so it is expected that everything will be resolved within a week before the annual meeting, and the election postponement will be no more than three or four days.</p>
<p>The Japanese Stance: Deeply Secretive</p>
<p>According to another report, the number of Japanese directors in this year's council director election will increase by at least one. Japanese newspapers had previously repeatedly made such statements, "Unless the Japanese community fails in this election, the number of Japanese directors must increase." It is widely believed that this point will be the focus of the three consuls-general's negotiations. However, the three consuls may have reached some understanding, conditionally allowing the Japanese community to nominate three people as Shanghai Municipal Council directors. It is learned that the Japanese Residents' Association, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association, and the Japanese Road Associations will jointly convene a joint meeting chaired by the "Electoral System Change Committee" to nominate another director candidate. The call for current Japanese Residents' Association Chairman Watanabe is the loudest. As for the incumbent Japanese directors Okamoto and Takao, it is expected that they will be re-elected without doubt. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers were deeply secretive about this matter, and officials were also tight-lipped, as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>The Chinese Directors' Side: Remains Silent</p>
<p>The current situation of the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council is clearly of concern to all parties. In February, the Chinese taxpayers began to elect candidates for the next term of Chinese directors. Due to various reasons, a postal election method was adopted. As a result, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Tingrui, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun and five others were re-elected. Unexpectedly, Yu Qiaqing pleaded illness and left Shanghai in the middle of last month. It is widely believed that in the current situation, the situation of the Chinese directors is extremely difficult, but the concern expressed by all parties has instead increased the difficulty. Regarding the dispute between the British, American, and Japanese sides over this council director election issue, the Chinese directors have never expressed any opinion. Although the Japanese side has tried to manipulate the Chinese directors, the Chinese director side has not made any indication to date.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Announces Resumption of Business Today; China Farmers Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank Resumed Business Yesterday; Shanghai Financial Stability Rumors Have Subsided</h3>
<p>In order to maintain financial order, the Ministry of Finance has declared its decision to have the Shanghai branches of the Big Four banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank) continue operations. It also ordered the four banks to urge the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, China Farmers Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank to resume business as soon as possible. Yesterday, the following news was obtained: (1) The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at 429 Avenue Albert and the office on Route Tenant are now repaired from the bombing, and the destroyed bills and internal preparations are complete, and will announce resumption of business from April 1st (Tuesday). (2) The Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank has announced, "Our office at 984 Avenue Edward VII (at the intersection of Dahua Road) will resume business on January 22nd. The business hours will be the same as before. Due to insufficient staffing, all businesses of the Avenue Joffre office will be handled by the main office on Avenue Edward VII. This is hereby announced." (3) The Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank at 539 Avenue Joffre and the exchange office at 1188 Avenue Joffre have resumed business from March 31st. All businesses are operating as usual.</p>
<p>Financial Bonds Begin Payment</p>
<p>The 15th redemption of principal and interest payment of the long-term financial bonds of the Republic of China year 17, totaling 1,125,000 yuan in principal and 365,620 yuan in interest, began yesterday through the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. All bondholders should first fill out the "Application for Discounting of Principal and Interest of Customs-Guaranteed Domestic Debt" and apply to the three banks for the issuance of a discount certificate. Then, they can use the certificate to collect the principal and interest in six installments, which will be paid in full by August 31st. Shanghai will pay with general bank drafts. As for the handling of the 9th redemption of principal and interest payment of the Guangdong Financial Public Bonds and the 8th redemption of principal and interest payment of the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Engineering US Dollar Public Bonds, payments also began yesterday, in full legal tender and US dollars respectively.</p>
<p>Facts Prove Rumors Were Baseless</p>
<p>After the self-imposed closure of various speculative markets in Shanghai, rumors spread throughout the city, and speculators took the opportunity to profit, causing market fluctuations. Now, the facts have proven the rumors to be baseless. For example, the Central Bank and China Farmers Bank have resumed business, and the principal and interest of financial bonds are being paid as usual. The claim that the Big Four banks were withdrawing has been proven wrong. Therefore, market rumors have subsided, and people's minds have calmed down. The black market exchange rate is still being maintained by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, authorized by HSBC, and legitimate needs are still being supplied as much as possible. As for the entire Shanghai financial situation, it remains stable as ever. The discounting and adjustment of the Big Four banks will continue, and the statutory interest rate and the equalization tax rate will be restored and announced when the Central Bank resumes business.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Request Protection</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, in order to discuss various important cases, convened a committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Ma Chonggao of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and Zhu Yigui of the French Concession Municipal Council were invited to attend. Fu Qian'geng was elected as the temporary chairman. The results of the discussion were not released. According to another source, the committee recently received a letter from the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association, stating that the Wan Yuan Rice Shop on Shanxi Road was accused of exceeding the price limit and sentenced to imprisonment. Rice shops throughout the city believe that their business operations are not protected and have asked the industry association for proper measures. The association then sent a letter to the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, explaining the difficulties faced by its members and requesting practical instructions on business policies to follow. Therefore, the Evaluation Committee convened a meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Jiechuan Hijacked off the Coast of Fujian; Passengers Kidnapped and Machine-Gunned; One Person Committed Suicide by Jumping into the Sea After Being Robbed; The Ship Arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of Last Month</h3>
<p>The British merchant ship Jiechuan (Marilyse Moller) of the Moller Line, weighing 500 tons, which sails along the Chinese coast, was robbed by pirates outside the port of Haikou, Fujian, on March 22nd, and suffered a great loss. Movable items on board, including the wireless radio and weather-measuring instruments, were all stolen. Twenty-seven Chinese passengers were kidnapped, and several passengers were wounded by machine-gun fire from the pirates. The ship had been out of contact with the company since March 21st and only arrived in Shanghai on the night of the 30th. It is now berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf, and the total amount of the loss is being estimated by Moller Line personnel.</p>
<p>First Ordered to Stop by a Japanese Warship</p>
<p>The Moller Line refused to disclose details about the Jiechuan hijacking incident. However, it was learned that the ship was hijacked near Haikou at about 11:30 PM on March 21st. Earlier, at 2:00 PM on March 21st, the Jiechuan departed from Fuzhou bound for Haikou with 297 Chinese passengers and a large quantity of cargo. After sailing for ten hours, it was ordered to stop by a Japanese warship at about 12:40 AM on March 22nd.</p>
<p>Then Searched and Finally Robbed</p>
<p>The Jiechuan was then forced to dock at a nearby port, where officers and soldiers dispatched from a large Japanese warship stationed there boarded the Jiechuan for inspection but found nothing. After being detained for 22 hours, the Jiechuan was allowed to resume sailing at 10:30 PM on the same day. Only one hour later, the ship was robbed by pirates. There were about twenty or thirty pirates, believed to have followed from the port where the Jiechuan was inspected on a speedboat to carry out the robbery.</p>
<p>All Items on Board Were Stolen</p>
<p>The Moller Line in Shanghai received the last wireless message from the Jiechuan on March 21st, after which there was no news. The company then dispatched another ship to search for it. On the evening of March 28th, the ship found the Jiechuan and telegraphed the report of the robbery. According to Chinese sources, the pirates first used machine-gun fire to force the Jiechuan to stop, and then swarmed aboard. The leader, who spoke fluent Japanese, directed the other pirates to steal all movable items on board. The wireless equipment, weather instruments, tables, chairs, bedding, and passengers' luggage were all taken.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven Passengers Kidnapped</p>
<p>In addition, 27 passengers were kidnapped. The pirates even tore down the rain tarpaulins. After a certain ship's officer requested it, only some of the tarpaulins were left behind. A certain Chinese passenger committed suicide by jumping into the sea because all his belongings were stolen. The Jiechuan arrived in Shanghai at 8:30 PM last night. The captain is Mr. Bowell.</p>
<p>Eastern Front: Chinese Army Advances</p>
<p>After the Chinese army on the Eastern Front continued to arrive, it advanced rapidly towards the Sujia-Shanghai border area, capturing key strongholds and actively arranging operations. This has been reported in previous newspapers. In the past two days, the enemy deployed Xu's troops in the Yujiadai area outside the east gate of Jiashan County in Zhejiang Province, and in the vicinity of Wujiang, Lili, Zhenze, Sizhuang, Beiku and other towns in Jiangsu Province, and in the Shangyang area of Shanghai Province. They forcibly requisitioned more than 300 civilian ships, towed by motorboats, and traveled to these areas for a large-scale "mopping-up" operation. The Chinese army had made strict preparations in advance, and launched a lightning action to meet the attack head-on, launching a fierce war. Both sides fired fiercely, and fought fiercely for a day and night. In the battle of Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province in the past two days, more than 30 Japanese soldiers were wiped out, more than 70 light and heavy weapons were captured, one motorboat was captured, and three people were captured. More than 70 people were wiped out near Lili, and two battalions were completely dispersed, and more than 170 rifles and 7 machine guns were seized, and one motorboat and seven or eight sailboats were sunk. In addition, near Zhouzhuang Beiku in Wusong County, more than 40 people were wiped out, and two officers were captured, and more than 100 pieces of light and heavy weapons, and more than 70 sets of military uniforms were seized. In the war near Shangyang in Shanghai, Ruan's troops personally led the command, sunk three motorboats, burned two, seized four heavy and light machine guns, one telegraph machine, and wiped out more than 100 people. Until dawn, because of the large army to assist, and there were planes hovering to cover them, Jiang's battalion in the Chinese side died heroically, and the officers and soldiers suffered a slight loss. The local troops of Chen Yaozong's regiment have been completely resolved by Ruan's troops, and reorganized and trained.</p>
<h3>Tao Guangchuan Still Detained in the Police Station; It is Believed He Will Be Released on Bail Soon</h3>
<p>Tao Guangchuan, principal of the Lequn Middle School at 970 Lane, Xinzha Road, was suddenly arrested by certain personnel accompanied by a foreign detective from the police station at his school on the afternoon of the 28th, and his school was searched, but nothing was found. Before they left, they arrested Principal Tao and detained him at the police station. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, Tao is very peaceful in the police station, and his family did not visit him yesterday. Tao is usually devoted to education and has always been law-abiding, so it is believed that he will be released soon to avoid being detained innocently.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiyuan's Painting Exhibition Opens; Promoting the Spirit of the Chinese Nation; Advocating Steadfast and Virtuous Customs</h3>
<p>Wang Jiyuan, a master in the art world, was originally famous for Western paintings. In recent years, he has also been studying traditional Chinese paintings. Because he is proficient in calligraphy, his brushstrokes are vigorous and simple. After August 13th, he published a collection of bamboo paintings, which was admired by people at home and abroad. Recently, he has been studying ink and wash paintings of the Four Gentlemen (plum blossom, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum), which contain a deeper meaning. All subjects with steadfast and virtuous themes, such as orchids, bamboo, pine trees, chrysanthemums, plums, and lotus flowers, are fully expressed in his brushstrokes. Yesterday, the preview of Wang's Chinese paintings was held at the Dafeng Gallery at 174 Henan Road. A total of one hundred works were exhibited, which is unmatched by various painting exhibitions at the moment. The content can be divided into two categories: (1) Sublime beauty, which can cultivate a strong will; (2) Elegant beauty, which can cultivate a calm mind, fully promoting the spirit of the Chinese nation.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Negotiates with Japanese Army; Exchange of Wharf Base; Jing'an Road and Waibaidu Public Wharf Exchanged for Bases on the East and West Sides</h3>

The map can be viewed at the Land Office of the Engineering Department of the Bureau's General Office on Hankou Road. If there are any protests regarding the proposed exchange, they must be submitted to the Director-General of the Bureau by April 15 at the latest.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Slot Machine King: Notes from the Audience</h3>
<p>— One Hundred</p>
<p>The U.S. Commissioner to China, Heermick, yesterday morning (March 31) continued the trial of Jack Lailey, the "Slot Machine King" of Shanghai, for operating gambling. After detailed interrogation, it was ruled that Jack would be sent back to McNeil Island Prison in the United States for a sentence of eighteen months. If he behaves well in prison, the sentence can be reduced to eleven months.</p>
<p>Lack of Sleep: Spirit Listless</p>
<p>When Jack was escorted to the court yesterday morning, he was rather listless due to lack of sleep in the Ward Road Western Prison. First, the lawyer from the U.S. Commissioner's Office, Hill, stated the charges against Jack for operating gambling, and said that Jack's establishment of roulette tables at the Follies nightclub was even more serious than "slot machines". For example, two people at that nightclub recently died from gambling.</p>
<p>Hearing of Past Events: Crying Out Loud</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer, Roache, then rose to defend, speaking eloquently and advocating for leniency. When Roache mentioned Jack's assistance to the poor, never stingy, Jack put his head on the table and cried out loud. Roache's defense was as follows: (1) Regarding the establishment of roulette tables at the Follies nightclub, Jack purchased half of the shares of the Follies nightclub in June last year. At that time, the nightclub already had roulette tables. After Jack was arrested, he sold the shares to Follies for 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Will Not Be Released Until 70 Years Old</p>
<p>(2) Regarding "slot machines", there are such machines on the U.S. President Steamship Lines and in the Shanghai U.S. Fourth Marine Corps Club. There are as many as 33 such machines in the Fourth Marine Corps Club. If these machines are illegal, then the U.S. military commander would certainly not allow such machines to exist in the club. (3) Regarding absconding after posting bail with the U.S. Commissioner's Office, Jack's action was a temporary mistake. Because he is currently forty-four years old, and he still has twenty-two years remaining of his sentence in Oklahoma State Prison in the United States. If both crimes are combined, then including the remaining twenty-two years, he will not be free until he is seventy years old.</p>
<p>Seventeen Counts of Accusations</p>
<p>Roache continued that Jack was accused of seventeen counts of crimes, which can actually be combined into two counts, namely setting up gambling tables and "slot machines". Regarding the latter, he obtained a license from the French Concession Municipal Council. The 25,000 U.S. dollars of Jack's bail was confiscated for not appearing in court, which is already a heavy penalty, so a sentence of six months for Jack is sufficient. Roache also cited the precedents of gambling thugs such as Cassia in the Public Concession being sentenced to only one year of imprisonment by the Chinese Special District Court a few years ago, and also said that the Oklahoma authorities in the United States probably do not need to arrest Jack and bring him to justice, otherwise Jack would have been arrested long ago.</p>
<p>Narrating His Life's Struggle</p>
<p>Jack was allowed to speak by Judge Heermick. He first said that avoiding appearing in court was a foolish act. Then he narrated his brief history, saying that his father was addicted to alcohol, and when he was only four years old, his mother abandoned his father and son and went elsewhere. He then entered an orphanage. When he grew up, he sold newspapers for a living and studied at the same time. At the age of nineteen, he joined the U.S. Navy and participated in World War I. After being discharged, he worked as a taxi driver in Oklahoma. Once, while driving a car near a jungle, the passengers were robbed, and he was arrested. The bandits were not apprehended for a long time, so he was sentenced by the court because he drove passengers to the vicinity of the jungle. After being in prison for three years, he joined the prison baseball team. Once, while traveling with the team a hundred miles away, he took the wrong train, and the train drove elsewhere, so he did not intentionally escape from prison. Judge Heermick listened and sentenced Jack to eighteen months in prison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Proposes to Add Bylaws to the Land Regulations for Discussion at a Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers</h3>
<p>This year's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers is scheduled to be held on April 17 at the Race Club. Before the annual meeting, a special meeting of taxpayers will be held to discuss the revision and addition of "bylaws" to the Land Regulations. The following are the proposed additions:</p>
<p>Registration of Doctors</p>
<p>Article 43: Registration of Doctors, etc. No person who has not registered with the Municipal Council may perform medical services, surgery, obstetrics, or veterinary surgery, or act as a nurse or midwife, or dispense medicine. Anyone who violates or breaks this regulation may be fined up to 200 yuan, or subject to other penalties prescribed by law.</p>
<p>Reporting of Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>Article 44: Reporting of Infectious Diseases. If any infectious disease (such infectious diseases are listed in the forms published by the Municipal Council from time to time) is discovered in any house, the attending physician shall immediately report the nature of the disease in writing to the responsible personnel of the Health Department. If the patient has not been seen by a physician, the resident or manager of the house shall be responsible for reporting, or the closest relative living in the house shall report. If the physician, resident, manager, or relative fails to report, they may be fined up to one yuan for each 24 hours of negligence.</p>
<p>Isolation of Patients</p>
<p>Article 45: Isolation of Infectious Diseases. If the Municipal Council proves through the Health Director that anyone is suffering from any infectious disease as listed in the above form, and the incomplete isolation or disinfection procedures hinder public health, the Council may transfer the patient to an isolation hospital and order them to stay in the hospital during the dangerous period. The Municipal Council may also charge the patient for the costs of transfer and hospitalization.</p>
<p>Prevention of Infection</p>
<p>Article 46: Unauthorized Exposure of People with Infectious Diseases. Anyone who knows that they are suffering from any infectious disease listed in the above table and has not taken appropriate measures to prevent infection shall not be allowed to expose themselves on the streets, public places, shops, hotels, or public transportation. Anyone who entertains such patients shall not be exposed to the outside without prior disinfection, and shall not live in or use infected houses, bedding, clothing, or other objects. In addition, anyone suffering from any infectious disease shall not be allowed to take milk from cows, wash clothes, or perform any business to avoid infection. The Municipal Council may remove infected bedding, clothing, or other objects for disinfection without being liable for compensation. Anyone who violates this regulation may be fined up to 300 yuan, or imprisoned for up to three months, or fined and imprisoned concurrently, or subject to other penalties prescribed by law.</p>
<h3>Childhood Vaccination</h3>
<p>Article 47: Vaccination. All persons over the age of six months shall be effectively vaccinated to prevent smallpox. The Municipal Council may request a relevant certificate of effective vaccination in the first three years. Anyone who delays in submitting the certificate or refuses to be vaccinated may be fined up to five yuan each time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Special Alert Lifted</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions implemented a special alert on the morning of the 30th, closing unnecessary roads and mobilizing all police officers and national defense forces of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to assist in the security work. Because the prevention was strict, it was able to pass safely. Therefore, the two authorities began to gradually remove the blocked roads and alleyways and barbed wire from the previous night, restoring the original state. As for the Volunteer Corps and the defense forces, they were all demobilized. The entertainment venues that were temporarily closed by order have resumed normal business yesterday. Normal preventive search work will continue.</p>
<h3>German Vessel Secretly Leaves Shanghai: To be Converted into a Raider Like the "Ramese" Going to Shanghai Arouses Attention; Unofficial Sources Say This Vessel Has Sailed to Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai "Times" reports that the German Henme shipping company's cargo ship "Ramese" has been stuck in Shanghai since the outbreak of the European War. It had been anchored off the Nanshi district, across the river from Pudong, for seventeen months. A few days ago, it weighed anchor and moved to a location outside the Lanlu Pier. On Saturday evening, it suddenly slipped its moorings and left the port, its actions suspicious, leading to various speculations. The ship has a deadweight of 7,983 tons and a speed of 18 knots. It quietly slipped out to sea around 5 p.m. on Saturday, without any other ships escorting it. Two hours later, it sailed out of the Wusong estuary. Its current location is unknown. Unofficial sources say that the vessel sailed to a Japanese port. Some say that it has already been armed, but observers do not believe this, because it was drawing very little water when it sailed out.</p>
<p>Did Not Obtain Customs Clearance from the Authorities</p>
<p>It is understood that the "Ramese" left the port without obtaining customs clearance from the local authorities in advance. Shipping circles here believe that the ship is likely to be armed and converted into a raider to participate in the war in the Pacific. The ship had flag markings painted on both sides and flew this flag high. Currently, the only large Axis power vessel remaining in Shanghai is the Italian ship "Conte Verde" (18,7xx5 tons). Recently, it has been reported that one of the Axis power vessels trapped in various Brazilian ports has weighed anchor and sailed to Vladivostok. Therefore, the departure of the "Ramese" from Shanghai is quite noteworthy. It is noted that the three Axis power vessels that left Brazil were the Italian cargo ship "Freesco" (2,790 tons), the "Franco Martello" (10,800 tons), and the German cargo ship "Trautenfels" (5,567 tons). This ship, owned by the German North German Company, sailed from Santos, Brazil, on Sunday.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Merchant Xie Kechang Shot Dead: Ambushed While Leaving His Yarn Firm, Two Bullets to the Head Causing Instant Death</h3>
<p>A shooting occurred in front of the Hengli Building on He Wu Road (Tianjin Road intersection) in the Public Concession at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. The victim was cotton yarn merchant Xie Kechang, who was shot on the spot and died instantly from the wounds. The details gathered by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency are as follows:</p>
<p>Suddenly Ambushed</p>
<p>Xie Kechang, a native of Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, was 35 years old. He established the Dachangxing Cotton Yarn Firm at Room 407, 4th Floor, Hengli Building, No. 95 Henan Road, dealing in cotton yarn and cloth, with good profits. Xie usually lived in the dormitory next to the firm, Room 406. At approximately 11:30 a.m. yesterday, Xie, wearing a gray striped flannel robe and yellow leather shoes, was leaving the firm, intending to go to the market to check prices. As he walked out of the Hengli Building and was about to step into his rented car (rental car license No. 7925), the assailant, who had been lying in wait in front of the door, without saying a word, drew a pistol and fired two shots at Xie.</p>
<p>Killed by Gunshots</p>
<p>Xie, caught completely off guard, was shot twice in the right temple. The bullets exited from the back of his head. He fell onto the car seat, blood splattering everywhere, and died instantly. Xie's car driver, Song Er'er (from Tongzhou, 42 years old), was shocked and stunned by the sight. The assailant fled south after the incident, disappearing without a trace. Although the watchman of the Hengli Building witnessed everything, he could only let the assailant escape because he had no firearms.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>After the incident, the car driver rushed back to the fourth floor to report the tragic news to the Dachangxing Firm, which then reported it to the Central Police Station. The police department dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene of the incident. However, the assailant had already disappeared. One suspect was apprehended nearby, but after investigation, he was identified as a messenger from a bank and had nothing to do with the case. He was immediately released. The body of the deceased, Xie Kechang, was transported to Renji Hospital by an ambulance summoned by the police, awaiting examination by the court.</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures Person</p>
<p>Yu Dixian, 19 years old, an apprentice at the Yonghexing customs brokerage firm on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, was hit in the back by a stray bullet. The bullet did not exit. He was taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Darkie Toothpaste: Fraudulently Obtaining Money, Shen Shanchang Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment, Shen Zhaoji Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Shen Shanchang of the Shanghai Chemical Factory and others, in collusion with Shen Zhaoji, the owner of the Shanghai Collapsible Tube Factory, manufactured inferior toothpaste, counterfeiting the trademark of the Darkie toothpaste of the Baichang Company. This was discovered by the company, which reported it to the Central Police Station. Detective Jiang Shangpei and Detective Ren Fengwu were dispatched to arrest them. They were brought before the First Special District Court. After interrogation by Judge Shi, Shen Shanchang was sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan for counterfeiting a registered trademark and fraudulently obtaining money. Shen Zhaoji was sentenced to four months imprisonment and fined 400 yuan. Zhang Hongchen was sentenced to three months imprisonment, and Zhuang Renbao and Ye Genlin were each sentenced to two months imprisonment. The counterfeit evidence was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Sheng Zhiren Dies of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Sheng Zhiren (60 years old), a native of Jingjiang who was shot on Xiafei Road, Dingji Lane, No. 8 in the French Concession the day before yesterday, was taken to Guangci Hospital after the incident. However, because the two bullets in his back remained in his abdomen and chest, and because of his old age and excessive blood loss, he succumbed to his injuries and died at approximately 7 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Grand Wedding of the Lu Family</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Xinhai, a prominent figure in the printed silk industry, and his younger brother Hongkui, and Miss Gao Xuanqin and Miss Cai Ruirong held their wedding at the New Capital Hotel the day before yesterday. More than 500 guests attended, all of whom were tycoons in the silk industry. There was also a Peking opera performance to add to the festivities.</p>
<h3>Mental Health Association Broadcast</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Health Promotion Association will hold a lecture tonight from 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. Dr. Liu Tingfang, former professor at Yenching University, will speak on "Mental Health and Religion" on Gospel Radio (frequency 76.0). All members of the community are welcome to listen.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued the following weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday: Shandong is calling. There will be southwest to north winds. The area south of Ma'an Island and around Dongsha Island will change from stormy to overcast. It will be sunny locally and stormy in some places. In the southeast, there will be northeast winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 65.7 degrees, with fog. The lowest was 34.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 53.2 degrees, and the lowest was 49.3 degrees.</p>
<h3>Sketches of a Small Theater</h3>
<p>— Lu Shao</p>
<p>Every day at sunset, in this corner of Fourth Avenue and Daxin Street, one can always see hundreds of people, shoulder to shoulder, slowly walking down from a dimly lit staircase. Everyone must know that this is the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse. After this burst of activity, there is another burst of activity that follows. Around 7 p.m., a "small" Peking opera theater—Small Guanghan—opens. Two table lamps on a rectangular table on the stage have long been lit, waiting to illuminate the beautiful faces on stage. After the drums sound, the singing girls follow the drumbeats, each coming out in turn to sing a passage, whether it's a Qingyi or an old male role, but it's hard to hear clearly. They are said to be very busy. After singing here, they have to rush to other places: perhaps to another place for solo singing, or perhaps to a brightly lit dance hall, to wait for their dance partners. They have various hairstyles, wear clothes of different colors, and shoes of various styles, but at one point, there is something that almost everyone has in common. Those who pay attention should already know what it is. What is it? It's that on rainy nights, everyone wears the same galoshes. This may be because they don't have cars.</p>
<p>After less than an hour, their voices are all warmed up. If you want to hear more, you'll have to come early tomorrow. After the solo singing, there is also a so-called—dress rehearsal. To give it a newer name, it's a costume performance. Except for two or three male roles, all the actors here are female. The combination can be said to be "neat and tidy." They often sing entire plays like "The Gathering of the Wolves," "Wang Baochuan," "Xunyang Tower," "Visiting the Mother and Returning the Order," and other major plays. Moreover, what they sing and do is all imitating Mei, Tan, Jin Shaoshan. If you close your eyes and listen, you might even think it's Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying… I sometimes think that. Other audience members have their own interests.</p>
<p>The facilities of this theater are certainly not comparable to those of large Peking opera theaters. There are no radiators in winter, no air conditioning in summer, and no upstairs seating or private boxes, hence the name "small." The ticket price used to be nine cents at most, then it increased by one cent, and now it has increased by two cents, for a total of eight cents. This is certainly the result of expensive rice and firewood, but compared to the high cost of various aspects of life, it is still a cheap place to pass the time. For this reason, it is full every night. Among these audience members, there are those who support the actors, those who listen to the singing, those who watch the performances, and those who study the rhythm or the erhu, each showing a knowing smile. As for the tea servers here, they don't have wages. Whenever they see a guest entering the theater, they serve them, making tea and providing towels. Their lives depend on this work to maintain their needs, which are not great, only one cent per person. Based on three or four hundred audience members each night, earning one cent per person, they still have an income of ten thousand yuan a month, but buying towels is also a major expense for them.</p>

<h3>Grain: Difficulties in Transportation Cause Rice Prices to Fluctuate, But Imports of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Although there is a large influx of foreign rice in the early morning market, the market sentiment remains strong. Although the crackdown on local rice has been relaxed, the demand from the inland areas has not diminished, and those holding goods continue to hoard them. Therefore, it is not easy to suppress the black market premiums. Small Jiaoba rice has risen from 3,700 yuan to 3,900 yuan per white bag. Saigon No. 1 rice has risen from 3,100 yuan to 3,300 yuan, and high-quality rice to 3,500 yuan. No. 2 rice is between 2,300 yuan and 3,500 yuan. Siamese rice is at 3,200 yuan. However, by noon, the demand from customers and wholesalers had weakened, and the market slightly eased. In the afternoon, due to the issue of fixed orders that the cargo owners used as a pretext, there were rumors that new deals had been successfully negotiated, but the rumors were refuted. People's confidence suddenly declined, and speculators sought to unload their holdings. The market was weak and lifeless. The premiums for various grades immediately fell by 100 to 300 yuan, but there were still few buyers. The new transactions included the Taiwan-Yi foreign firm unloading 1,750 tons of small Jiaoba rice for future delivery in April, at a price of 159 and a half yuan. Also, the batch negotiated by Daofu, priced at 156 yuan, could not be agreed upon due to the price difference, but shipping and other issues are not a problem. It is said that the total daily transaction volume of foreign rice was 15,000 bags, and the amount arriving was also 17,000 to 18,000 bags.</p>
<p>Among the thick and thin japonica rice, thin rice accounts for more of the supply than thick rice. However, sluggish sales persist, and the local stores' sales channels remain stagnant, making it difficult for cargo owners to maintain prices. They can only lower prices to attract buyers. As a result, thin rice has fallen by more than two yuan. Qingjiao rice is only 110 yuan to 111 yuan per dan for spot goods, and 115 and a half yuan to 115 yuan for original packages. Thick japonica rice has only depreciated slightly by one yuan due to its scarcity. If Changbang rice has special japonica at 192 to 193 yuan, high japonica at 190 yuan, Kunshan rice has high japonica at 117 to 118 yuan, the general market is at 114 to 115 yuan, down to 110 yuan, and original packages at 195 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market is difficult and there is not much goods. Cargo owners have no intention of lightly unloading. However, all retail channels are sluggish, and the market color cannot help but appear slightly soft. Hong Kong special rice is 107 yuan, high rice is 105 yuan, general market is 101 yuan, medium and secondary rice is 101 yuan, 100 yuan, glutinous tea special is 97 yuan, and secondary rice is down to 91 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is pouring into Shanghai. The Yihua foreign firm's Mingsheng vessel arrived in port the day before yesterday (30th), carrying 11,484 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Taigu Company's Guangdong vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,100 bags from Siam and another 4,403 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is found that the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in March is even greater than in January and February. It will be announced as soon as the calculations are clear. (Zhu)</p>
<h3>Hoarders Release Stocks: Flour Market Collapses and Plummets</h3>
<p>The flour market yesterday showed signs of collapse. Since the sharp increase on Friday of last week, actual sales have not been urgent due to the supply of cheap flour. Moreover, with the rumors subsiding and a large batch of Canadian flour arriving in Shanghai, people's confidence finally weakened, and hoarders began to release their stocks. Zhonglou brand Australian flour opened at 29.89 yuan, but soon softened to 29.67 yuan. Jinlong brand Canadian flour initially opened at 29.5 yuan, but also softened to 29.23 yuan, a decrease of 700 to 800 cents compared to Friday of last week. The Hua factory's cheap flour remained at 25 yuan, supplied by the Fuxin factory with 5,873 bags, with the shortage supplemented by extracted foreign flour.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday had no special characteristics. There was a shortage of Du wheat arriving, with only sporadic arrivals, mostly supplied to Japanese factories. Due to the scarcity of goods, prices were maintained between 45 and 46 yuan, while trading in the central market remained virtually suspended.</p>
<h3>Grains and Staples: Corn Supply Exceeds Demand, Price Drops by More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the corn (maize) market began to decline at the beginning of last week, the highest price has differed from the current market by more than ten yuan. The reasons are nothing more than that sales channels are sometimes open and sometimes blocked due to road conditions, and heavy taxes have greatly reduced transportation. On the other hand, the source is perceived to be unblocked (10,000 bags of Dutch goods were also transported yesterday). At present, it is not appropriate to store goods, and hoarders are collapsing. Therefore, people's confidence is discouraged, and the market trend has been depressed. Yesterday, under the circumstances of multiple parties eagerly seeking to release, both spot and futures prices fell sharply by about three yuan. It is estimated that 1,500 bags of Saigon corn were traded, priced at 34.5 yuan to 33.2 yuan at Yinzhan, 34.8 yuan at Benzhan, and 32.5 yuan at Waizhan. The delivery price for March and April was set at 65 yuan. Six cars of Dutch white corn were priced at 34.2 yuan to 31.7 yuan, and four cars of yellow corn were priced at 34.7 yuan, with the delivery price for April set at 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, 550 sheets of bean cakes came from Qingdao, and today (1st) there were 460 bags of beans and 715 bags of sesame seeds, and 300 cans of sesame oil, all transported to Xianggang.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquettes Are Shipped as Usual, Black Market Disappears</h3>
<p>The price of coal briquettes had been changed privately by general firewood and charcoal shops due to a labor strike that stopped production at various factories a few days ago, relying on a small amount of inventory, with each dan shouting as high as thirteen or fourteen yuan, taking advantage of the fire and grabbing, and making a rare commodity. However, since the six major factories resumed work yesterday and shipped as usual, the black market has disappeared and returned to normal. It is delivered to customers at 240 yuan per ton, and 12 yuan per dan, and must not exceed this price.</p>
<h3>Financial Exchange: Supply Scarcer</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday, HSBC listed, at 9:30 a.m. announced that both English and American exchange rates had increased by 0.0625, English gold at 3.21875, American gold at 5.01875, French and German had no market, New Dutch had not changed, and Hong Kong and Japanese exchange rates had increased. The English and American exchange black market, in sparse transactions, saw a steady rebound. It is heard that a certain bank's banknotes will circulate in the city today, and although the number of importers and Chinese speculators colluding is not huge, foreign banks' supply is weak. Therefore, 5.34375 yuan for American gold is difficult to settle, and English gold is also tight to 3.25. In the afternoon, initially, Chinese merchants sold less, and the situation stabilized. Until 3:30, the English bank suddenly came in to absorb profits, speculators turned out, and the trend became tight again.

The central listing of each exchange rate remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, English gold at 3.265625, American gold at 5.34375, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous weekend. After opening, speculators had a slight intention to buy, and the April American gold futures were at 5.34375, intending to collude with foreign banks, but the profit-making bank was asking for 5.3125 yuan, so no deal was made, and the market became slightly tight. During this time, gold was at 3.25, and American gold was at 5.3125. The HSBC listing was announced, and all except New Dutch increased. The silver balance angle was also announced, and there was no rise or fall. After this, the market was calm, and only the import foreign firm's spot goods were slightly bought at 5.325, and speculators also settled into the foreign banks' April American gold at 5.325. Later, the transaction became more silent, until the close, with no vitality. English gold was at 3.25, and American gold was at 5.2125.</p>
<p>The Black Market Sees a Tightening</p>
<p>The after-market initially reported dull flatness, with Sassoon and the Chinese bank selling out slightly, but the British bank's profit-making was quite appetizing, and the April American gold was traded at 5.3125. Around 3:30, there were sudden favorable news in the market, speculators came to buy, and the market situation was tight. Until the evening close, the current and future English gold were all at 3.234375, and the American gold was all at 5.28125. As a result, it was tighter by 0.0325 and 0.0625 than the previous weekend.</p>

<h3>Buyers Forge Ahead, Gold Market Moves Towards a New Peak</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Gold black market yesterday, although the initial situation was firm, it seemed to hover. In the evening, there was favorable news, rumored that the banknotes of "a certain bank" will circulate in the concession area today, and the exchange market tightened, stimulating buying. Hesheng, Dafeng, Shunyuan, etc. forged ahead, causing the sharp rise to 6,578 yuan high before the evening close. The result was also 6,574 yuan, a gain of 66 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The entire day's transactions were flat, estimated to be about 15,000 taels.

In the afternoon, Chengji first sold 20 taels to a certain number 120 yuan higher, and then sold 60 taels to Litai only 110 yuan higher. Because Xiangxing Yong then returned to the upper, bought 100 taels to Mingfeng 120 yuan higher, and then bought 20 taels to Gongda 130 yuan higher, 10 yuan higher than the previous day's price. The hanging decoration gold was 10 yuan lower, and then returned to flat, still 690 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Gold rose 66 yuan</p>
<p>Early in the morning, each ticket (10 taels) opened at 6,505 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan compared to Saturday. Because Chengji, Xinfeng, Yongyi, and Da came to buy, the market situation gradually increased. Before long, the exchange report was soft, and Xianghe tracked the search. Although Dafeng Hengji all sold out at this time, retail customers were healthy, so the head was still insufficient, and gradually rose to 6,540 yuan. The buyers then reduced, and Decheng, Tianyuan, Tongkang, Yongde, Defu, etc. sold out, and once retreated by 20 yuan, reaching 6,510 yuan. However, the exchange market was still soft, and retail customers took the opportunity to enter again. Before long, Dafeng suddenly came in to drag, and Jinyuan Chengji also searched in without exception, and the price rose again to 6,595 yuan. Later, with the reappearance of Xianghe's multi-heads, Yida Dayuan also sold, and until the close, it retreated by more than 10 yuan, to 6,538 yuan. In the afternoon, Gonghe sold, lowering to 6,525 yuan, but someone bought in with 30 yuan difference, and then Shunyuan Mingfeng fished people in, lifting to 6,538 yuan, and then Xiangxing Yong gradually sold out again, down to 6,530 yuan. After that, trading was stagnant, and the ups and downs were extremely flat, hovering around 6,535 yuan. After 3:30, due to favorable rumors, the exchange report tightened, and the buying trend was stimulated. Hesheng Yulai crawled in, followed by Dafeng, Xinyuan, Shunyuan, etc. also hurriedly came to buy. Until the close, it rose to 6,578 yuan. After Chengji sold out, it once retreated by 8 yuan, but there was still 6,574 yuan at the close, a result of a 66 yuan squeeze compared to the previous Saturday. According to the American exchange rate of 9.28125 yuan, it was settled at 6,594.1 yuan, a push of 20.1 yuan. Outside the market, there were transactions at 6,580 yuan, a full 73 yuan rise and fall. The price of the cash number's own brand gold sold was 150 yuan higher than Shanghai Gold (futures), and the purchase reduction was smaller than the selling price of 70 to 80 yuan. There is no line or market for cash standards, etc.</p>
<p>The original disc of silver building decorated gold did not move</p>
<p>The price of silver building jewelry gold per ounce was lowered by 10 yuan at 11:30 in the morning, and then increased by 10 yuan in the evening. As a result, Datonghang and Xintonghang still both suspended 690 yuan, and the purchase reduction was 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Hovers Awaiting Firmness</h3>
<p>The public debt black market situation yesterday hovered and was firm. Because species were already raised to a very high level before, and there were too many multi-heads in species, it was slightly visible to energize. Species and species were better, because they are the best in the five unified public bonds. It is allowed to push species as the first. Yesterday, the transaction still did not flourish. Tongkang and Xinfu turned and sold out in the morning. Datong and Xie Kang also sold out. Tongshun bought in a lot of the A species. Lianhe bought in a lot of the B species. The market price was slightly weak in the afternoon. In the afternoon, Xinfu and Zhikang suddenly added in. Renfeng absorbed kind, and the 41st bought in weakly. However, Yuxing sold out species very strongly. Lemao Yongchang sold out weakly. Most of them were multi-heads of species and species. The market price result was that the highs and lows were mutually visible. The total number of transactions was a total of 1.89 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Other Categories Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Stock Transactions, 50 shares of the World Book Bureau were traded at a price of 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the opening of the stock market of the Public Works Bureau was very strong, and there were no major ups and downs that day. Only Huidefeng shares opened at 111 yuan and rose to 114 yuan at the close. Shanghai Enterprise shares only sold for 5.85 yuan in the morning, but suddenly rose to 6.15 yuan at the close. All stocks were very active, but rubber stocks were still rarely noticed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales Remain Sluggish, Yarn Market Falls and Then Rises; Off-Market Trading Already Reaches 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially declined and then rebounded, but the trend is still wavering. Actual transactions are rare, mainly due to difficulties in various shipping lines, which greatly affects the purchasing power of customers. As a result, short sellers are particularly active. As for the bulls, they are constantly absorbing, as prices of almost everything else are high, while cotton yarn prices remain sluggish. However, with increasing inventory and shrinking sales, this is not a fundamental solution in the long run. Therefore, factories are sacrificing spot prices to move yarn and reduce inventory, which should benefit the market. Twenty-count Double Horse brand high price was 1399 yuan, low price was 1379 yuan. In the early afternoon, the initial price was 1400 yuan, then fell to 1396 yuan. Later, news of rising gold prices and securities firms covering shorts pushed the price up to 1404.5 yuan. The final price was around 1403.4 yuan. Today, 970 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened weakly in the morning because the Zhongxin Factory announced to all customers that shipments of Variable Horse brand goods must be cleared before April 15, otherwise a storage fee of 3 yuan per bale would be charged. This caused some gains to be sold off, and speculators seized the opportunity to sell. Therefore, the initial price opened low at 1380 yuan, slightly decreasing to 79 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms bought to cover shorts, and the market gradually stabilized and rose to 88 or 89 yuan, then above 90 yuan, fluctuating for a long time. Later, news of rising margin calls and profit-taking pushed the price up to 1399 yuan. However, actual sales remained sluggish, and the price fell back to 1395 yuan. The closing price was 1397 yuan. According to statistics, 7045 bales were traded during the day. The amount bought by various firms is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 95</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 6750</p>
<p>Total: 705</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market was sluggish due to weak factory demand and reluctance of holders to sell, believing the yarn market was good. A total of 800 bales of foreign cotton and 500 bales of domestic cotton were traded. Prices rose by about 1-2 yuan. The following are recorded transaction prices:</p>
<p>Middling: 338, fellow traders, 200 bales</p>
<p>American Pinhuk: 282, also, 100 bales</p>
<p>Superior: 292, also, 100 bales</p>
<p>Huisideng: 285, also, 200 bales</p>
<p>Jue Huisideng: 280, Shenxin, 200 bales</p>
<p>Langgonghua: 208, fellow traders, 100 bales</p>
<p>Also: 208.5, also, 100 bales</p>
<p>Huoji grass bales: 196, also, 300 bales</p>
<p>Also: 197, also, 200 bales</p>
<p>Additional information: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is generally not very active because the yarn market is not very good, so factories are not buying in large quantities. At the same time, fellow traders are reluctant to sell at low prices because they hold goods. The market situation is therefore quiet and unremarkable.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose early in the morning due to speculative buying, and then rose even more due to buying by spot traders and short covering. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day, up 14 to 28 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to long liquidation, but then rebounded due to strong buying of April-May contracts and short covering of July-August contracts. The market situation also became firm. Yesterday's closing price saw White Locke the most active, rising 10 rupees, while other advances ranged from 1 to 4 rupees. The opening market situation today is predicted to be 2.5 rupees higher.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sales Prices of Cotton Cloth Increase; Outlets to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia Surge; Dyeing Factories Rush to Buy Gray Fabric</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was very firm, with sales prices gradually increasing. This was due to a surge in outlets to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia, and a sudden increase in demand from dyeing factories for gray fabric. As a result, sentiment turned tight. White fabrics such as Fugui and Dapeng brands of fine cloth and twill rose by 1.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Coarse cloth such as Datong coarse twill and Yihuo coarse cloth also rose by 3 to 5 jiao. Bleached cloth was flat, while colored cloth and line cloth rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. The street traded over 1000 pieces of spot goods and April futures of various cloths. Guangdong and Yunnan buyers purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and coarse and fine cloths. Zhejiang and Fujian buyers also purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Overseas, Singapore, Siam, and other places purchased over 6000 pieces of colored cloth, twill, and printed cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market sentiment was rising sharply. White fine cloth and fine twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao per piece. The spot market was closed due to renovations. New store orders for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth were sold off-market at 50 yuan. Futures on the exchange also rose by 5-6 jiao at the close. April was 50.03 yuan, May was 51.03 yuan, and June was 51.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (the 1st), 1180 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained firm due to continued hoarding and strong buying of futures in preparation for store receipts. The association's price assessment for spot goods, grade 24 white, initially was 89.3 yuan, then 89.2, 89.1, 89.15, and finally 89.2 to 89.3 yuan, up 3 jiao. Futures for April 10 large orders were even firmer, at 89.3, 89.6, and 89.7, 89.6 jiao. April 20 store receipts initially were 90.05 yuan, then slightly decreasing to 90.04, 90.02, 90.01, and finally 90 yuan, but the closing price remained at 90.05 yuan. Taikoo refined white was little changed, B mark was 90.5 yuan, DY mark Western warehouse was 85 yuan, Eastern warehouse was 84.5 yuan. Also, 230 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Experiment of Immortality</h3>
<p>— Mo Ran</p>
<p>Scientists have long known that human body cells can still live for a considerable time after death. However, the question of how long these cells can live has not yet been fully answered. An astonishing message came from Berlin this spring, which aroused the attention of the world. American scientists dare not believe this scientific answer and are eagerly awaiting a more complete report.</p>
<p>The German answer says: Human body cells can be immortal, at least in theory. This is the conclusion reached by Professor P. Busse-Grawitz after completing a set of experiments at the German Hospital in Cordova, Spain. This professor started his research a few years ago. He put some human body cells that had been preserved in alcohol for 38 years into a nourishing liquid and found that these cells grew "healthily."</p>
<p>Professor Busse-Grawitz reasoned that if the flame of life can be preserved in alcohol, it may also be preserved by other methods. So he took some cells from the mummified bodies of Indians who were buried in Argentine stone caves 600 years ago. When he put these cells into a nourishing liquid, it is said that these dead cells, which had not shown any signs of life for more than 600 years, actually began to multiply.</p>
<p>The professor did the second step of the research. He took some of the world's oldest human cells to experiment. He obtained some cells from twelve Egyptian mummies. These mummies were dead people more than 5,300 years ago, and their bodies had completely dried out and begun to decompose. After these long inactive cells were placed in various nourishing liquids, it is said that they all began to grow. This growth was not stimulated by electricity or chemicals, indicating that those cells did not really die. Therefore, Professor Busse-Grawitz put forward the astonishing conclusion that although humans will die, the cells in the body are, in fact, immortal.</p>

<h3>Air Raids and Mental Illness</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>According to a report by psychiatric expert Dr. White, some residents in the UK showed signs of nervous tension before the German air raids, which was obviously caused by fear. However, after many air raids, this nervous tension gradually disappeared because people had become accustomed to the air raids, and those who suffered from mental illness or had a tendency to develop the disease had automatically moved elsewhere. During the last World War, many people who suffered from mental illness caused by war, which had already been cured, relapsed this time.</p>
<p>The result of the air raids has increased the number of mentally ill people. These people are not alarmists, but are forced by extreme fear and danger. One woman became unconscious, curled up, stiff, and had a rapid pulse because her sister-in-law was bombed to death and she herself was almost hit by a bomb. After treatment, she was able to speak, but her mental illness relapsed immediately when she heard the sound of bombing. A sixteen-year-old girl was almost hit by a bomb and could not move her limbs or speak after being frightened. She gradually recovered after being treated with psychotherapy, but she completely forgot what happened at the time. There was also a staff member in an airplane who suffered excessive fright after encountering a fierce bombing and became mentally disordered. He wandered around London, sometimes hiding in the subway tunnels and sometimes coming out to buy clothes and food. When he was sent to the hospital, he appeared extremely tired, his hands trembled, his pulse was rapid, and he cried from time to time.</p>
<p>Most of the mental illness patients caused by air raids are of this type. Under the threat of air raids, it is undeniable that a group of healthy people can become mentally abnormal, and those who already suffer from mental illness will become even more serious.</p>

<h3>Blessed are those who are confident</h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>Confident people are worthy of praise and envy. Fragile people mostly cannot withstand the slightest blow. Their hopes, their happiness, their beliefs can be shattered by those slight blows.</p>
<p>Confidence is not arrogance, but confident people only know how to obey the truth. No obstacles, no blows, no ridicule, no persecution can wear down their courage. Truth supports them, so they have the power to resist everything. Truth guides confident people, and even if hunger, pain, jealousy, hatred, or even death awaits them ahead, they will hold their heads high and walk firmly.</p>
<p>In the eyes of confident people, truth is God.</p>
<p>Confident people love truth as much as they love their lives, but when life and truth cannot be reconciled, life becomes insignificant. Therefore, confident people often sacrifice their precious lives and lower their heavy heads in the face of truth.</p>
<p>Stubbornness, arrogance, self-righteousness, and despising everything outside of oneself cannot be called confidence. Foolish people are like this, but confident people are never like this. Only when truth is tightly grasped will they become stubborn.</p>
<p>Confident people never reject the opinions and advice of others, and they are willing to accept anything that is consistent with the truth.</p>
<p>The strong confidence of many great inventors and thinkers in the past is often very touching. Confidence took away their happiness, confidence made them spend their lives in ridicule and persecution, confidence turned their lives into torture, and their lives were just a constant struggle, struggle, and struggle, but what other people in the world are nobler than those who dedicate their entire lives to mankind? Who else can feel greater joy than them when their ideals are realized?</p>
<p>Blessed are those who are confident!</p>

<p>This was a segment of a "Surname-Surname" tune. On stage, it was usually accompanied by suona horns and huqin fiddles. The melody was very high-pitched. Autumn Begonia initially tried his best to lower his voice to sing, but after singing two lines, he couldn't hold it back. Xiangqi heard him singing so loudly. Although she knew that the mute maid still couldn't hear him, she seemed to have to be mindful of the neighbors on both sides. She originally wanted to stop him, but she didn't want to interrupt his interest, and the clear and bright singing sounded very beautiful in her ears, so she remained silent and listened.</p>
<p>"It's hard to sing well without a huqin," Autumn Begonia said, shaking his head after finishing a long passage of Erhuang Yuanban.</p>
<p>Xiangqi smiled at him again.</p>
<p>"Tell me, am I singing well or not?" Autumn Begonia squatted on the right side of the chair, looking up at her, his hands firmly grasping the armrests of the chair. "I don't believe what others say, but you can at least give me an honest opinion, right?"</p>
<p>"It's really good! It's a pity that only I can hear it, and there's no one to applaud you." She leaned her upper body slightly forward, freely letting her gaze meet Autumn Begonia's gaze directly.</p>
<p>"Who needs applause? You should reward me!" He boldly stretched his hands upward and patted Xiangqi's shoulder.</p>
<p>"What do you want as a reward?" (69) (End of Chapter 5)</p>

<h3>Eating Meat</h3>
<p>— Mimi</p>
<p>"Nothing is more sorrowful than eating vegetables, and nothing is more joyful than eating meat, especially mutton," my younger brother often joked at mealtimes. Our whole family loves to eat meat.</p>
<p>On my brother's birthday, the dining table was filled with many small dishes, including a pot of meat, a pig's trotter, and a bowl of beef soup. As everyone was eating with relish, my brother waved his chopsticks and said with a raised eyebrow and smiling eyes, "Today's mutton tastes really good. Even if I have to pawn my pants, I'll buy it to eat." My brother's words sparked a wave of laughter.</p>
<p>"If you didn't have money, would you really pawn your pants to buy meat? If so, that would be considered consistent in words and deeds," my sister's provocative words pierced directly into my brother's ears.</p>
<p>Although my stubborn brother felt that he was just joking, he would feel "ashamed" if he didn't retaliate against his sister. So he said playfully and happily, "Of course." My sister, who knew him well, had already anticipated his retaliation, so her reply was already on her lips. As soon as my brother finished speaking, her words immediately fell from her lips: "If that's really the case, then you'll definitely have a day when you have to pawn your pants, and it will be soon. You know, the year before last, meat sold for one yuan and four jins, last year it sold for one yuan and two jins, and this year you can only buy half a jin with one yuan. By the end of this year, it will probably rise to one yuan per tael. What about next year? Perhaps it will become valuable but unavailable, and even if it is available, it will be so expensive that you'll have to pawn your pants."</p>
<p>At this point, my brother seemed to have been driven to a dead end, and everyone's eyes were focused on his embarrassed face. With a flash of inspiration, my brother's face turned from embarrassment to joy. "You say that meat will become more expensive every day, but in reality, meat will only become cheaper every day. If you want me to tell you the reason, then you have to treat me to a movie tomorrow." My brother's riddle stumped my sister, but fortunately, she was a movie fan and easily agreed to the condition. She also countered by saying, "If you can't explain it, you have to treat me." "Of course," my brother said without hesitation.</p>
<p>With a "snap," my brother jumped out of his seat and went to the desk, where he wrote a certificate, signed it himself, and my sister also signed it. My brother's attitude was like that of a magician. He looked at everyone's face in turn, and then took out a treasure from his pocket. This was a leaflet he had gotten at the tavern the day before yesterday – a flyer from the Guide Agency: "Can sing famous Chinese and Western songs, with a melodious voice, can dance social dances, sexy and charming, lovely and beautiful, guarantee your satisfaction... One yuan per hour, red stars three yuan per hour." My sister's outstretched head retracted. "That's one example, and the neighbor on the third floor gave birth to a baby girl yesterday and gave it away this morning without charging a cent..." My brother said triumphantly and with pity.</p>
<p>"You're comparing a small ditch to a well. You're talking nonsense. You lost," she said, seemingly unwilling to accept defeat, so she said these words.</p>
<p>Before my brother could protest, I interrupted, temporarily setting aside the matter of the movie. Both my sister and brother were victorious and both made good points. My sister was talking about the cycle of rising prices, and my brother was talking about the issue of women's liberation, which is closely related to every woman. This flyer from the Guide Agency is a microcosm of women in society. The word seams of thousands of years of human history are engraved with the oppression of women being treated as "cheap goods." To be fair, I would rather be a prostitute than an ordinary woman under feudal forces, because the former is a public plaything, while the latter is a private plaything and slave. This is the real situation: it is a disgrace to women. To wash away this disgrace, we can only..." Just as I was speaking excitedly, my sister interrupted me and said, "We can only stop being muddleheaded, living in a drunken stupor, and only strive to change this unequal system."</p>
<p>"Right," "Right," everyone tacitly agreed.</p>

<h3>Wartime British Theatre</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The protracted war has completely transformed the British people. Someone who was familiar with Britain in the past would find it difficult to find the old habits that she has preserved for so long. This transformation is especially pronounced in the theater, where 25,000 actors (theater, film, circus, etc.) have lost their positions. Constant bombings have forced actors who used to earn 1,000 pounds a week to sell their art for only 10 pounds a week.</p>
<p>There are only three theaters in the entire London area now, and they only perform matinees. A famous British theater magnate has dismissed his actors and completely closed the theater. As a result, the "National Association of Theatrical and Film Employees" has to spend 1,800 pounds a week to help some of its most impoverished members. Recently, the association has petitioned the government, hoping to allow these unemployed actors to participate in performances in public air raid shelters or large gatherings related to national defense.</p>
<p>London's two most famous theater companies, the Old Vic Players and the Sadler's Wells Opera Company, have recently been performing in provinces far from London, such as Lancashire; in the past, these places could only hear their names. Their headquarters are located in a textile factory, which is naturally not as comfortable as London, but they have to make do. In the northern provinces of England, there hasn't been such good performance in over thirty years. The war has democratized the noble theater.</p>
<h3>Tan Wenchang's Famous Qin Player</h3>
<p>— Li Yunying</p>
<p>In opera troupes, the stage is traditionally divided into "Wen" (civil) and "Wu" (military) sections. Drummers, gong players, cymbal players, and small gong players all belong to the Wu section; while jinghu fiddles, erhu fiddles, yueqin moon lutes, and stringed instruments are classified as Wen. In the Wu section, practice usually starts with the small gong, then the cymbals, followed by the large cymbals, and finally the drums, a step-by-step progression. It's different in the Wen section. It depends on the student's hand sound (i.e., intonation). Those with a strong sound often learn the jinghu fiddle, while those with a softer sound learn the erhu fiddle. However, when first entering the field, everyone is instructed to practice the erhu fiddle first. In the past, there were many famous qin masters, such as Mei Dasuo (i.e., Mei Lanfang's grandfather), Sun Zuochen, Li Peiqing, Chen Yanheng, etc., all of whom were masters of their time. They have all passed away one after another. In recent years, the opera scene has been lacking in talent, with only a few people still worth mentioning. I will briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>Xu Lanyuan is the qin player for Mei Lanfang, the "king" of the performing arts world, and has accompanied him on tours abroad. Wanhua's performances owe much to him. Although Wang Shaoqing's popularity has been greater than Xu's in recent years, it is only a temporary phenomenon. In terms of the excellence of Lanyuan's qin skills, he should be considered the best qin master of modern times. Recently, because Mei Lanfang has been living in Hong Kong for a long time and is not performing, he has been hired by a certain radio station in Peiping as a professor to lecture on qin skills.</p>
<p>Zhou Changhua, originally named Changhua, later changed to Changhua, and now uses Changhua, is the qin player for Cheng Yanqiu. He used to sit in the Liao Binqing Society as a child and study Sheng roles, but later switched to the Wen section because his voice failed. He then accompanied Kun actors on performances, but without much fame. Later, because Mu Tiefen followed Zhang Eyun, Cheng Yanqiu strongly hired Changhua to play the qin. He is exceptionally intelligent. Even Yanqiu's subtle nuances in singing, he can accompany without missing a beat. Last year, Yu Shuang came south, and his performance of "Suo Lin Nang" had many excellent arias. There was nothing beyond the risks of his singing style, and Changhua was able to play with ease.</p>
<p>Yang Baozhong is the cousin of the famous Laosheng actor Yang Baosen. He originally specialized in Sheng roles, and his performance in the play "Da Gu Jia Cao" was his masterpiece, especially his drumming skills. He was unfulfilled throughout his life and repaid people with a knife. Six years ago, he switched to the Wen section. Baozhong was originally able to play the qin, and coupled with a stint helping Lian Liang, his fame greatly increased. His skills are quite good, and he is also very good at fulfilling his accompanying duties. The score may be flowery but it is not chaotic, and the tempo is fast but very steady.</p>
<p>Others, such as Zhao Laba, the qin player who helps Tan Fuying, plays the qin with his left hand pulling the bow and his right hand pressing the frets, which is called a strange hand in the Wen section. As for the newly emerging Li Muliang and others, they are all juniors, and their skills are not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Alexander Korda and Merle Oberon Shocked by Newsreel: London Home Roof Pierced by Bomb</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>British director Alexander Korda and his British wife, Merle Oberon, are both working in the film industry in Hollywood. Recently, they saw a newsreel of the bombing of London and were shocked to discover that their home in London was also captured in the footage. The roof had been pierced by a bomb, and the window glass was completely shattered. If they hadn't seen it in the film, they wouldn't have known that their home had been damaged.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy and Arthur Hornblow's marital harmony has been admired by others. Recently, news suddenly broke that Myrna had divorced her husband for unknown reasons, shocking people in the film industry. The marriages and divorces of Hollywood stars have a "lightning" style, which is truly astonishing. Rumors that Claudette Colbert and her husband, Joel Pressman, were growing apart, and that Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were at odds, also began to spread. However, Claudette and Robert have already categorically denied these rumors.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Around the Hairpin</h3>
<p>— Shuo Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Swallows Kick Flying Flowers, the Banquet Lacks Elegance</p>
<p>We siblings are willing to follow your lead and work together with all our strength. This time, we have come here at the risk of being exposed, using the excuse of temporarily resolving a dispute, to seek an audience with Master Li. Now that we have finally achieved our wish, we are so bold as to express our foolish thoughts, and hope that Master Li will make a decisive decision and accept our humble opinion." Li Xin couldn't help but be surprised by these words. He glanced at Tong Tianfeng again, and saw that Tong Tianfeng was staring at him intently. He thought to himself, I have also heard of the name "Hong Niangzi" in the Green Forest, a female demon who doesn't blink an eye when killing, but I didn't expect her to be so graceful and beautiful. I thought they were just a mob, wanting some money at most, but who knew they were Green Forest bandits? Their secret arrival here harbors a great ambition to collude with me, to use my name to rise up in rebellion together. But I think, as a true man, how can I be a rebellious traitor, to be spat upon by future generations? How can I agree to this? Tong Tianfeng saw Li Xin's expression and knew that it would be difficult for him to agree, so she said with a smile, "Young Master Li, please don't hesitate. The Taizu Emperor of this dynasty was originally an ordinary person, and he won the world on horseback. Young master, in this chaotic world, why not rise up in response to the times? We will always support you." Li Xin had no choice but to reply with a smile, "Thank you both for your patronage, but we are all people of the Great Ming, how can we betray it? Moreover, my ancestors' tombs are all here, how can I rebel? I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to this." Tong Quanbao sneered when he heard Li Xin's refusal, and said, "The world belongs to everyone, not to one person alone. I have long heard of Master Li's great name, but I didn't expect you to be so timid, not even as good as a woman. Then it's true that seeing is not as good as hearing. Since Master Li is afraid of trouble, you might as well tie up the two of us siblings and send us to the officials, and you might even gain credit." Li Xin said, "Leader, please don't say that. How could I do such an unjust thing? However, I am ashamed to say that because there are other considerations, I have not been able to agree. Moreover, everyone has their own ambitions, and cannot be forced. I am sorry to have disappointed you both with your visit." Seeing that Li Xin was determined not to agree, the Tong siblings said, "We didn't have much confidence in success when we came here. We just wanted to see what kind of person Master Li is. Now that we have met and talked, there is not much common ground. Since Master Li is kind enough to keep our secret and not send us to the officials, we are very grateful. We will take our leave now." After saying that, they got up and left. (26)</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shouwu</p>
<p>It is said that the script for the Guolian "Family" movie has now been decided to be written by Wu Yonggang, Wan Cang, Zhou Yibai, and Yang Xiaozhong. After the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the directing committee for a decision, and then the directors will divide the work and shoot the film. Guolian's cautious attitude is certainly worthy of praise, but whether the method of having the directors shoot in segments is appropriate seems to warrant further consideration. (Editor's note: According to yesterday's news, this proposal has been cancelled and Zhang Shankun will be the executive director.)</p>
<p>Since Li Jianwu took office as the performance director of the Shanghai Drama Society, his first major event was to stage his own "Lying Family," which he had been rehearsing for two years. After "Lying Family," they originally planned to stage "Zhengqiang," which had also been in rehearsal for some time, but recently it has been said that they will stage Xia Yan's "Chou Cheng Ji." The rehearsal time is scheduled for one week. Xia Yan's "Chouchengji" is indeed something that thousands of audiences are eagerly awaiting, hoping to see it as soon as possible, but to put it on stage with only one week of rehearsal is nothing short of infanticide. We certainly don't hope that the Shanghai Drama Society, which has put forward the slogan of "improving quality," will allow this to happen, but we can't help but pay attention to the development of this situation.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang and Li Qinian have been quite close lately, and both have plans to return to Hong Kong. According to reliable sources, they may return together.</p>
<p>Since its publication, the "China Art World Daily" is said to have thrown a hand grenade at the silver screen.</p>
