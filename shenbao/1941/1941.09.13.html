<p>合衆社十二日紐約電　本日大概已有數百軍艦、從事於實行羅斯福總統之命令矣、在實際上我國之部隊、將與英國及協的國之海軍及飛機密切合作、此謂我國之軍艦及飛機、將隨時隨地使用英國及協約國之根據地、我國部隊之大部份、當然將使用之戰艦或將進入地中海及其他海面、依照羅斯福總統之命令、我軍司令將獨立並與英國聯合、搜尋德義船艦、吾人現時所從事之海上大搜捕、大致將限於運送租借軍火至英國及南非之路綫及太平洋上至海參崴、仰光及紅海之各路綫、往澳洲之路綫及由澳洲至新加坡、印度及非洲海港之各路綫、亦或必須施行有限制之巡邏、</p>
<h3>羅斯福演詞全文</h3>
<p>路透社十二日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨晚在其爲一般人迫切期待之廣播詞中、警吿德·義、今後其軍艦若駛人美國防　海綫內、則自尋危險、其言曰、余已發訓令、致美國海·陸軍總司令、立即實行此政策、其全部責任、由德國負之、苟德國不繼續自尋射擊、則不致有射擊云、總統謂、德潛艇首先向美驅逐艦格里埃號射擊、志在擊沉之、此乃事實、就法理與道德言、此爲海盜行爲、此非偶然事件、但係整個計劃之一部、七月間會有一潛艇在北美領海中追隨一美戰艦之後、欲處於可施攻擊之地位、其瞭望鏡顯明可見、當時在該處百哩之內、未有英·美潛艇、故此潛艇之國籍顯然可知、納粹潛艇爲地中海之響尾蛇、今已屆積極防衛之時機云、總統續稱、吾人前未謀取對希特勒之射擊戰爭、今仍不欲謀取之、但吾人亦不願以聽令我海軍船隻於進行其職務時、受希特勒攻擊之代價謀取和平、納粹欲廢除海上自由而自握海洋之絕對統治權、此乃目無法紀之行動、納粹果握有海洋支配權、則其第二步驟即可顯見、即以武力支配美國與西半球是、余對此步驟之嚴重、未有幻想、爲保護國家計、此爲不可免者、美海軍之無敵、僅在英海軍存在時爲然、美國海上自由之傳統政策、今依然適用、不獨在大西洋爲然、即在太平洋與其他各洋亦復如是、美國國防船隻、將復坐待軸心國施攻者首先施攻云、</p>
<p>路透社十二日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統播音演說之全文如下、余據美海軍部報告、知美驅逐艦格里埃號於白　中向冰島進發時、而於九月四日晨駛抵格林蘭東南某地點、該艦載運往冰島之美郵件、高懸美旗、其爲美艦、一望可知，不致錯誤、該艦當時在該地點遭潛艇一艘攻擊、德國承認此為德潛艇、該潛艇故意對於格里埃號發魚雷一枚、旋又以一枚繼之，以施攻擊、雖希特勒之宣傳局虛搆諸說、雖任　美國妨碍派之團體或願相信其言、但余須以此鹵莽事實吿知諸君、即德潛艇未發警吿，首先轟擊此美國騙遂艦、並蓄意沉之是也、吾人之驅逐艦是時駛行之地點、乃在美政府所宣布之自衛海面、即大西洋中美國保護之四圍諸哨位是也、吾人於北面已在冰島、格林蘭、拉白拉陀、紐芬蘭設立哨位、懸多國國旗之許多船隻駛過此海面、諸船運載供平民用之糧食與其他供應品、諸船運載戰品、此項戰品、美國人民費億兆金元造成之、並由國會之行動、宣布此爲保衛彼等自己土地所必要者、</p>
<h3>襲擊美船政策　實係海盜行為</h3>
<p>美國驅逐艦被攻時、正在盡其合法之使命、如該潛艇發魚雷時、能見該驅逐艦、則此攻擊乃納粹欲沉一明白易認的美軍艦之故意企圖、即不然、而該潛艇維時乃處海面之下、甚至不欲有察明該艦屬於何國之麻煩、而藉聽聲器向美驅逐艦發出聲音方面發出魚雷、如德國公報所云者、則此攻擊甚至更爲殘暴、蓋此足以表示對航行海上之任何船隻、不分交戰國或非交戰國任意行暴摧毀之政策也、此實海盜行爲、就法律與道德言，此非納粹政府在此次戰爭中所犯仇對美旗之第一次、亦非最後一次之海盜行爲、攻擊相繼發生，一月前懸美旗之商船羅賓摩爾號駛於南大西洋中部、爲一納粹潛艇在侵犯成立已久的國際公法與人道各種原則之情勢下擊沉、該船乘客與海員、在距陸數百哩之洋中被迫入無蔽之小艇、此實直接違反德政府所簽之國際條的、事後納粹政府未作一言道歉、亦未聲明事出錯誤、亦未提供賠償損失、一九四一年七月間、美國戰艦一艘駛於北美海面時、爲潛艇一艘尾隨、該潛艇經歷多時、圖使其艇處於易施攻擊之地位、其透視鏡露出海面、明白可覜、當時在此地點數百哩內、旣無英潛艇亦無美潛艇、則此潛艇之國籍、顯然可知矣、五日前、得悉懸吾人姊妹國巴拿共和國國旗之商船四沙號業已被沉、餘生者僅三人、八月十七日該船未受警吿、先被魚雷恊擊、繼在格林蘭附近爲砲轟擊、其所載者爲供給冰島平民之用品也、現恐該船其他海員均已溺斃、德潛艇出沒該地附近、已爲確定之事實、故施擊之潛艇、其國籍已無合理之疑點矣、五日前、另一美商船「鋼水手」號、當駛往埃及某口岸時、在距蘇彝士南二百　十哩之紅海中、爲一德飛機擊沉、懸美旗之船、被沉或被沒者、現已確切查明者、共有四艘、其二爲美海軍之軍艦、第五起被沉之船、則明白懸有巴拿馬之國旗、吾美人對此情勢、現正緊定脚跟、吾人民治文明之形式、已滋長一種感想、即任何國有對吾人船隻之一、作海盜行爲之攻擊一次、不得不與該國作戰是也、吾人今並不惶惑、或喪失吾人意識之平衡、故余今所想者、與所言者、並非關於任何偶發之枝節、吾美人對於若干基本原則、與陸海相繼發生之事件、現正取遠大之眼光、此必須認爲整個的、而爲世界事變之一部分、</p>
<h3>納綷陰謀暗算　業已暴露無遺</h3>
<p>夫以一大國、對於一偶發事件、實不屑張大其詞、或因一狂暴行動、而怒不可遏、但今次事件、證據確鎜、已表明其非出偶然、而係總計畫之一部分、故如小視其影響、則將爲不可恕之愚昧、重要之眞相、爲此種國際非法行爲乃會使美國人民明瞭已久之一種計畫之暴露、此爲納粹廢除海洋自由、而自握海洋絕對控制權之計畫、蓋此控制權、一旦入其掌握、則其後一步驟、即以武力控制美國與西半球之途徑、即能進行無阻也、海洋在納粹控制之下、凡美國或任何美洲共和國</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>統制外滙初步完成後</h3>
<p>英美凍結資金·經一月來之安排，今始見有頭緒，然亦賴有英美兩政府勸告之力，不然，市場黑匯，彼此利用，安得有消滅之日。但今之消滅，能否不生波折，澈底付諸實行，尙待事實證明，目下期許之，猶爲過早。惟事亦不難，市上所謂外匯，實際上僅美滙一種而已：美滙之淸算，應操之於紐的市塲，苟無例外之可有，進出胥歸其控制，自不虞有游離之美滙什外，更無分化之作用可言，故上海外滙之出納只須英美銀行有維持推行之決心，雖欲作崇，不可多得。假如黑滙澈底消滅之後，外滙出納，統籌於平準會，而以爲法幣至此，失支其自由買賣外滙　連帶亦失去所有之價值者，是誠大謬：蓋法幣之兌換英美滙，並不以買賣自由與限制。增减其價値，自經統制之後，反可有確定之行市、不若黑滙市塲而瞬息變化。或謂僅一部分物品可以結滙則法幣亦僅有一部分得見其功用，是亦纏夾之談；蓋物品有一部分可以結滙，有不能結滙，爲物品之選擇問題，非法幣之效用問題。法幣並不指定某一部分可以買外滙，某一部分不能買外滙，只要爲法幣，無一不可用以購外滙，此即法幣眞價值所在，亦即張張法幣，有張張購買外滙之可能也。且因消滅黑滙市場之故。滙率釘住於相當水準、因之物價亦得維持相當之標準。此則與安定民生，大有裨益。</p>
<p>今此供給外滙之物品，寬大異常，非但顧及上海人之生活，亦且顧及上海人之享用：非但顧及工業之運用之材料，亦且顧及工業發動之機件。然而自奉則百般揮霍，奉公則分文不費，專圖享用不顧公益之人，猶以爲未足。套滙圖利之輩，感覺不便、時思破壞無論已；即投機操縱之徒，亦有爲黑滙市塲消滅，不便於其行動者，而陰懷嫉忿。此皆自外生成，不可以人情理性論。後此物價之趨勢，所受於幣値之影響者當微，而所受於人為操縱者猶不能絕。蓋如（一）不供給外滙之物品，勢必任意高漲，以爲囤樍居奇之計，（二）則明知有供給，而亦以不供給物品價格作榜樣。步步上抬。（三）則需求者孰知市上所售之物品何者應廉，何者爲高。則運銷者猶可逞其渾水摸魚之慣技。若是則所謂統制外滙，仍是利工商而殘民生，雖統制之目的並不爲物價，而統制之效用，固亦兼及於物價之調整，設事實果如是。不無令人惋惜耳！</p>
<p>故以為清單甲所列之物品若米若煤若石油產品，此三者爲人生日用所必需，一方旣須供給以外滙，一方亦應控制其物價。如米，自經工部局公賣以來，或因其成本關係，公定價有時高出於市價，致有以低劣之米，攙雜於公賣米中混售漁利之弊，似此尙爲購銷之技術問題，不足爲公賣米病；蓋自有工部局米應世，確有使米市操縱，不易奏效，米價調整，差有成就，功固不可湮沒。故今對於洋米供給之外滙，似應用以供給工部局之公賣米爲限，俾工部局有統制租界內糧食之眞實力量！蓋惟工部局辦米不以營利爲目的，志不在牟利。但爲徵信於公衆，工部局亦應將分批定米之數暈，淮價外費，以及出售情况之爲盈爲虧，每月或每一時期，公布報端，庶足以昭大信而間執奸商之口。納子煤與煤屑所製成之煤球，已成爲全市唯一之燃料。次之爲煤油，並有一部分供燃燈之用。此外爲工廠食糧之烟煤，及及熟水店之煤屑，皆直接間接，與民生日用有深切之關係。向來洋行煤商之出售方法，在整批而不注重分售，遂使用棧單，而將煤盡落於有財力之囤戶及煤炭商手中，眞正之消費者，有所需求，反不可得，得亦出價奇昂；而大利歸於商人，害則普及於貧民。今旣供給以外滙，理應平準其物價，改革其分配辦法，自惟有停止棧單買賣，以絕操縱囤積；亦惟有注重門莊現售，以杜商店於中居奇牟利，又惟有兼應用戶之需求。而後可實際入於消費者之手，減輕一般生活之負起。煤油地位，已不若煤之重要，然其爲民生日用品則一；且自煤貴以來，小家庭用火油烹庖者日多，電費貴，而有改點火油燈者亦不少。煤油之價。似乎得煤油公司之拘束。尙不若煤價之橫跳，然亦十餘倍於當年。故應力求以公允之方式，分配於消費者，不應以高厚之利潤，供囤戶之揮霍。烟葉徒爲消耗而已，而亦與米煤同列，是則專顧大衆之享用，及英美友邦商人之事業，惟於分配外滙之際，不應與米煤等量齊觀也。</p>
<p>至於法幣之地位，爲一般所深切注意，其實不焦慮於漏巵未塞之前，而焦慮於漏巵旣塞之後是爲多慮。此固不必談高深·但問一家開支·節的持家。少一文開支，必於其所持之財產，多保存一文；反之而揮霍無度。則其財產日朘月削，終至破產而後已！况自已揮霍不夠，且復供人使用，涸竭更可立待。及知揮霍之不當，而思量入以爲出，防他人之侵蝕，則惟有嚴密出納不爲功。出納旣嚴密矣，消耗有限制矣！而慮財產之價値不如前，得無有此事實乎？故法幣之價値，自經此次統制外滙成功，基礎愈形鞏固，價値不求自高，會看勝成之來臨，而知祀憂之無謂。之商船、除仰　息於此外國專制權力外、不復能自由經營任何和平之商業矣、大西洋曾爲日當永爲吾人自由友好之孔道者、於是將成美國商業、美國海濱、美國內地各城之致命的威脅矣、希特勒政府違反海洋法律與其他各國所享曾經公認之權利、搜自在紙上宣布海洋廣大區域、甚至連位於西半球之巨浸在內、己予封鎖、船隻除自冒被沉之危險外、不得因任何事故駛入該區域、若軍實際現已在廣　之區、而在擅自封鎖區域内與遠在其外者、任意不發警吿、擊沉船隻、此種攫取海洋控制權之納粹企圖、僅爲別在西半球全部實行之納粹陰謀之配合部分、一切皆趨向同一目的、蓋希特勒之前鋒團、不特爲其所承認之秘密員、目爲彼置吾人中之僉壬、已在新世界中爲彼準備立足與橋端、俾一旦攫得海洋控制權、即可需用之、</p>
<p>希特勒在此新世界中所佈置之陰謀晤算、美政府無一不知、密謀起事之案、嘗相繼發生、去年圖攫取鳥拉圭政府、幸爲該國迅雷不乃掩耳之行動破敗之，其美洲鄰邦當時皆予以充分之援助、未一復圖在阿根廷倡亂、經該國政府縝密以智謀在各地點遏止之、距今不遠、又圖暗算玻璃維亞政府、一已往數週中、曾在哥倫比亞易達巴拿馬運河之界內、發見飛機秘密降落塲數處、</p>
<h3>美決竭盡全力　維護海洋自由</h3>

<h3>紗花　羅總統演說發表後　紗市突轉上升實銷與補空並起</h3>
<p>迥旋兩日之紗市、昨則已轉趨上升、此因一般拋空奢鑒於報載蔣委員長對美記者稱、中國不變國策、於是人心振盪、放空頭的人們、大受打擊、已有扒補傾向、同時廣幫交易轉趨活動、不像上日之滯遲、至於南洋方面、仍在談判中、有人說昨晚成交二十支雙馬五百件、價爲一千七百四十元、因此拋賣减縮、檯面帶緊、市價即升、美總統之演詞宣佈後、商塲上之議論、對於紗市不能看鬆、然大量的空額未見扒進、仍在掙扎中、所以市態尙鎭靜、漲力仍屬迂迥也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百六十二元、低價爲一千七百四十三元、午後開盤人氣熱烈、因羅總統演說發表後、人心安定、價爲一千七百六十四元、漲至一千七百六十八元、收盤價爲一千七百六十二元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、氣勢尙平、首盤價爲一千七百四十三元、但以消息良好、買者紛紛而來、檯風較緊、少頃漲至一千七百六十二元、同時取引所價亦見跳上、人心更挺、然有一部份盈利人吐出、又復回挫至一千七百五十二元、旋聞港幫現紗交易較爲活絡、取引所價收盤又昂、空頭扒進、又升至一千七百六十二元、查半日間成交統計九千五百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>金雙馬期貨市况、反趨急騰、驟然欣欣向榮、蓋以美棉首先上升、廠單隨之而昂、人心大都興奮、散戶補空尤甚、檯面買氣瀰漫、遂引成易漲少跌之局面、當晨初開出、走勢即頗挺秀、如蟄伏之大戶、乃加碼與新做以拉提、近期爲烈、因此塲中求多供少、殊爲買戶所左右、九月期開出爲一六五五元、十月期爲一六六六元、十一月爲一六八二元、開盤曾步趨上游、但中途因羅總統演辭廣泛、使人心無從根基、加以取引所一度回小、乃期紗遂亦軟化、但旋又回上、午收約各漲五元半至十餘元、午後以廠單步堅、買氣史爲旺盛、市價節節而上、九月期曾高至一六六八元、十月期升達一六八〇元、十一月期亦漲至一六九二元、殊覺穩定、俄因散戶獲利稍有了結、曾略徵跌、結果九月期爲一六六四元、收市軋漲十四元五角、十月期爲一六七六元、好上十七元五角、十一月期爲一六九〇元、上升十五元五角、觀趨勢、以大戶之拉提近期、其中當有主因、故期紗之脚地、若無國際上不良之刺激打擊、一時或有穩堅可能、但亦須愼防多方逢高之脫手耳、茲將成交價格表列左、</p>

<h3>江北棉運滬受阻　印棉遂為大衆爭購</h3>
<p>現棉交易不暢、但以美總統之演說發表後、人心安靜、紗價巳轉漲、情况隨之趨昂、至於美棉又向上進、所以同業心思仍傾向看好、加之江北方面棉花今後到埠已受阻隔、是以人心轉信外棉、對印花復羣相爭吸焉、</p>

<p>印度棉市、、先因棉籽交易良好而漲、但續後又因棉商套賣、及多頭了結而跌、結果昨日收盤價格約跌二至六羅比左右、又預則今日開盤市况看漲三·二五羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况靜而堅、雖各方人心、均因美棉脚地堅實、及本市現棉甚昂、而購意十分踴躍、但因船隻仍不易得、而同時外滙結款亦未見順利進行、故實際交易不多、昨日除現棉情况稍有點綴外、定貨交易僅有三四批小額巴西棉成定也、</p>
<h3>證劵　游資所注　債劵股票</h3>

<p>股票交易、成交永安公司股一百股、價爲一十六元五角、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、上漲仍勁、賣方出籠雖亦衆多、無如買戶氣勢甚盛、價格稍回即吸、從而增盤拉抬、結果形成漲易跌難、半日間成交超越百萬股、收盤潛勢極端堅强、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票漲多跌少、中國債券前檔英德續借款（英發）及英法借款（英發）各升一鎊、英德續爲四十八鎊，英法爲四十六鎊、克利斯浦及善後英發各跌一鎊、前奢爲二十九鎊半、後者爲三十七鎊、後檔鐵路債券、北髯獨漲三鎊爲六十鎊、津浦原續發各升半鎊、價爲十二鎊、英股麥加利銀行股續升一先令三便士、價爲九鎊七先令一便士、開平煤礦股升六先令、價爲十四先令、餘無變動、</p>
<p>上海邇來有一種新趨勢、即凡是股票無一不上漲、所有華商股票亦無股不貴、如上海各種華商公用事業股如水電電氣、皆在停業中、亦且損失甚鉅、然有則超過票面、有則亦在六七折之間、至於營業中各股、超過於票面者十居八九、自凍結之後、一般游資、又趨向於證券一途、中外股之飛漲、又焉知不爲游資作祟、</p>
<h3>金融　抑低黃金期貨　利於補空</h3>
<p>現金亦升六十元</p>
<p>昨日金市烚亦暗市、期現貨同吿上漲、十月期內有討論、以香港申匯結價之傳說、且近數日步見下跌、巳在美匯黑市扯價結價之下、空方趁機抵補、故價由六千八百五十三元、步升至六千八百六十二元、收市軋漲九元、交易八百餘兩、現余跌風已戢、上日利空傳說已消散、客幫止售、自晨開卽低十元、永豐首出二十兩、價八千八百七十元、天元進後續買成記十兩爲八千九百元、德成進合盛永豐餘慶泰永各十兩、明豐進鳳祥和記二十兩、及同康永十兩、爲八千九百十元、順源進聯興十兩爲八千九百二十元、德孚進熾大十兩升至八千九百四十元、恒記出中興二十兩、永成出祥和十兩、爲八千九百二十五元、祥和進大豐十兩、八千九百三十元、又進合盛十兩、八千九百二十元、永成出祥興永十兩、退至八千九百元、祥和進合盛二十兩、大豐十兩、均八千九百十元爲午收、下午首由大豐售予祥和七十兩、又與穗成各出十兩予某銀樓、爲八千九百十元、後祥和再進大豐十兩、最後升至八千九百四十元、軋升六十元、當日有七十元差度、交易約三百兩、現金號之本牌金、門市售價約九千元、收進比售價减二百元、飾金亦軋升十元、計九百二十元云、</p>

<h3>華商在美存款　無法提現不得已在黑市兜售</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央與滙豐兩掛牌及滙豐小櫃檯價均平、黑市英美滙因受美國凍結資金影響、華商在美行之美滙存軟戶已無法提現、故四出兜售予非必需品之進口洋行、得在美國銀行劃帳、作價多爲四元八四三七五及八七五、英滙約二辦士八五九三七五、正當商業結款仍少、</p>
<p>香港十二日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩異常、各滙均無變動、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市起伏終歸平定</h3>
<p>洋米　朝再度下貶後、昨日因跌透之餘、引起實銷乘廉添備、及皮球活躍、突見回緊、早市開手、一般賣戶旣都待貨觀機、不肯再事輕脫、而本街店胃頗多問津、同時空方又起補空、且有新囤戶吸收、當見皮球交易風起雲湧、　動異常、於是賣戶乘機扳持、喊聲猛提、各價一路直上、一號西實高貨開至百二十三元、銀行棧小絞開至百零九元、外棧百零八元、嗣因價高銷滯、纔復趨平、輾轉現盤旋之色、及後更以獲利浮戶又都乘高出籠、市貨轉旺、頓告反緊還疲、節節回軟、如此起伏者再、迨收市之際、始又復緊、所以結果收盤行情卒較前市見增一二元不等、全日現米成交一萬四千包、英華司八九百噸、邇日謠言雖見利空、然大戶尙爲堅持、但在日美和戰之局未決定前、‘市價不致過份起色、本週各棧存米一百十九萬九千七百五十四包、比上週計减少四萬四千餘包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米早稻及破粳新粳各以其來源之多寡、銷塲之暢否爲轉移、所以結果　南港早稻以貨旺見貶一二元、開百四十八元至百四十五元半、共無錫破粳則以供求相仿未有榮辱、特粳仍爲百五十二元、崑山高粳則爲百五十元、至於新粳以貨稀不敷分配、堅俏異常、獨見挺秀一二元、開百五十三元至百五十一元半、糯米去路雖屬不廣、仍僅一些零星胃口、但來源久斷、市貨已稀、貨主無意輕脫、故在扳售之下、市面站守原盤、未有變化、　售香港特元百二十七元、普通高自百二十五元半、次至百一十一元、糯菉百十一二元、</p>
<p>洋米又有來滬、怡和洋行源生輪、由香港裝來洋米一萬包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、該項洋米係工部局平價米、（祖）</p>
<h3>麺粉零星去路</h3>
<p>昨洋粉實銷尙見熱鬧、蓋在月餅訊中、雖無大　動辦、而零星去路頗不寂寞也、本街各戶續有添辦外、客幫內地亦稍應酬、坎粉金龍脾及美粉砲台牌、因品質佳而存貨充、乃認爲市上標準賣買外、即一般雜牌亦有小數點綴、全日成交各粉二萬三千包、實銷居其大半、緣囤戶以日美和戰之局未定，進旣不敢、出又不忍、雙方隨成擯局、市上旣少此輩活動、市面始得趨於平坦、惟浮戶之皮球交易終不能免、故行情終有波動、售開金龍西棧早市三十元〇九角、繼至三十一元○五分、後叉回平、午後三十元〇八九角、砲台三十二元七角至三十二元六角、五燕三十二元一角、香蕉三十二元三角半至三十二元、澳粉鍊樓三十三元五六角、本粉三十四元一角、均比前市漲一二角、</p>

<h3>油市　菜油洋荘問津價又回上三四元</h3>
<p>食油市况、因洋莊突來問津菜油二百噸、價爲二百元、致人心頗爲挺俏、拋空者業見减少、市勢轉呈向榮、菜油及棉子油一度激升六七元、嗣以獲利者吐售稍回、結果比前尙軋升三四元、統市售開九月下交大有廠淸油六千多擔、開盤價爲一百七十一元、最高一百七十三元、最低一百六十元五角、收盤一百七十元零五角、又生菜油五百桶、價一百七十一元至一百七十元、日華廠菜油五千桶、九月下交開盤一百六十九元、最高至一百七十五元、收盤一百七十一元、又十月上交一百七十元零五角至一百七十元、立德廠菜油三百桶、價一百五十六元至一百五十八元、泰山廠菜油二百桶、價一百六十三元、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局公共事業委員會、曾於昨日下午四時半、在工部局會議室、舉行會議、討論兩案、（一）寳隆醫院要求自來火公司對該醫院所用自來火予以特別折扣案、（二）上海電力公司要求核准徵收煤斤附加費案、關於第一案、寳隆醫院所依據之理由、因該院爲公共事業、故要求减納自來火費、惟該院所述各節、全市各醫院均可援例、是以結果如何、頗可注意、至於第二案、除對大量電力消耗者業巳實施三成限制外、一方擬對工業用電、徵收煤斤附加費、因該公司在一九三二年時、亦以上海煤斤缺乏、除工業用電力消費者外、對於一般用戶、亦徵收煤斤附加費、計一度機附加費一成、故此次是否微收煤斤附加費、須待討論後始能決定、但昨日會議結果如何、尙未能探悉、</p>
<h3>結匯辦法修正　取消保證制前請外滙須補填申請書　渝經濟界鼓勵游資內移</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯世界電訊社十二日重慶電、此間經濟界人士談稱、平準基金會規定、滬上經營國際貿易者、必須將出口所得外匯、售與十四家銀行、否則拒絕供給進口所需外匯、此項辦法、乃掃蕩殘餘黑市之有效措置、外匯黑市消滅後、法幣之內移、可以用升水方法、加以刺激、同時更應鼓勵物資內移、政府對移運物資者、聞將予以運輸上之便利、及代保兵險、升水之損失、政府亦可補償、此外、財部宣佈有正當用途者、得申請動用外幣、存款在外國銀行被凍結而欲移存中央銀行者、勢將增加、</p>
<p>供滙物品　價可穩定</p>
<p>麥加利銀行總經理霍金士、昨對記者談、此次平準會所頒佈之九月份試行辦法、係經平準會全體會議通過、當會議時、主席爲中國主任委員陳光甫、本人及花旗銀行監督麥凱、均列席、美籍委員福克斯、則由其幫辦泰萊代表出席、當靦克期由馬尼刺返港後、曾於上星期　、又與全體委員舉行會議一次、經鄭重通盤研究後、始對所擬定之辦法、作最後決定、香港會議結束、余等乃買棹返滬、自平準基金會公佈關於供給滬市外匯之新辦法、規定若干特准進口物品、得按平準會所定美匯五元三一二五結匯以後、主要進口物品之市價、雖尙無下降之傾向、但據某美商油公司職員稱、石油產品之價格、至少在油商與平準會代表之磋商未曾終了以前、不致有何變動、某藥品進口商亦謂、進口藥品之價格、不致變動、如平準會所定辦法完全付諸實施、可遏制藥品價格之上漲、</p>
<p>已結外滙　補填申請</p>
<p>中央銀行巳接到平準基金會命令、頒佈修正之必需品進口請求供給外匯辦法、幷已通知十四家友邦銀行及中國交通農民等三行、囑令一體實施、且以修正之申請書格式、交由各關係銀行照式印製、分發各往來進口商行、追溯自九月三日起開始依照平準會所定價格供給外匯、至於在九月三日以前用書面或舊式申請向指定銀行請求供匯者、必須重塡修正之申請書、辦理各項手續、刻各指定之中外銀行、備函連同申請書單張、寄達各客戶矣、修正申請書、名爲「向平準會請給所需外匯申請書」計分白色與紅色兩種、凡爲甲乙兩種淸單上所載物品請給外匯者用白色、如每月數額不超過美金二千元或英金五百鎊之小額貿易請給外匯者用紅色、兩者皆爲五聯式、第一、二、三、四等四聯交平準會、第五聯由銀行存底、各聯均須由經手銀行及進口商行簽宇或蓋章、凡進口商之欲請給外匯者、得向任何一家指定銀行取得此種申請表格、將關係各項塡明後、交由原經手銀行彙呈平準會要求核准、至核准期限及核准方式與數額等、全權由平準會決定、申請書之性質、僅類似調查表格而已、</p>
<p>核准結滙　方式變更</p>
<p>申請書之第十項、原有「如平準會發現此處所述之進口物與該申請書中所述者尙有不合、則敝行願將爲供給進口品而得自平準會之外匯、依照購人時之匯率、全數再行賣予平準會…」保證性質之規定、但修正之申請書則將此叚刪去、攷其理由、依照舊法、在申請書送達平準會以前、得逕先電報申請、而後將申請書補上、因此如平準會發覺申請書所載尙有不符時、得令原經手銀行追還已核准之外匯、而今按照修正辦法、平準會核准結匯、須一律在收到申請書以後、根據實際情形決定准或不准、或結全部、或結一部、故原方法中「再行賣予」之保證自可取消、</p>

<h3>繼抑平米價之後　抑低煤球市價工部局已與法公董局合作　煤球廠被投彈後仍未歛跡</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、公共租界與法租界市政當局、刻正組織委員會、以期控制煤球售價、若獲成功、則數百萬市民、受益不淺、該委會之委員、將由何人出任、尙未可知、工部局發言人僅謂、一正與法公董局合作設立此委員會中」、</p>
<p>公會無權</p>
<p>查煤球現較戰前高漲二十倍之多、煤業公會企圖抑低其價、但重要煤球製造商十家、皆公會會員、近已退出公會、自定高價、公會遂無權實行其限價之決定、近月來、煤球價愈漲愈高、竟達每擔十七元二角之空前高價、兩租界市政當局、前以自行採辦洋米應付民食問題、獲優良成績後、今乃決定成立新委員會、研究應付市民必要燃料煤球之問題、而設法解決之、</p>
<p>抑制方策</p>
<p>據煤球製造商自稱、一每擔十七元二角、乃公允售價、僅獲合法之利潤、而售價昂貴、乃因從越南與印度運入煤屑、成本加重所致一、視察家認爲市政當局須自行辦理運入煤屑事宜、並斷然實施其他嚴峻步驟、始能抑制煤球價格、市政當局究將取何行動、當然將視新委員會之建議而定、煤球問題之嚴重、可於兩煤球廠近遭投彈炸傷三人事見之、投彈奢目的在欲求煤球價减低、茲新設委員會亦以此爲目的、但將覔一更有效之合法途徑進行之、</p>

<h3>脂粉消耗驚人</h3>
<p>據江海關方面探悉、今年一月至七月、香水脂粉之進口、値計五三九·一七四海關金單位、合國幣計一百四十五萬九千五百四十四元、去年一月至七月、則祇三二九·〇三五海關金單位、折合國幣八十九萬六百九十九元、故今年超過去年同期之進口數、達國幣五十五萬元之多、按當此國力維艱之際、此種不必要之脂粉消耗費、竟有變本加厲之勢、實須有所警惕、</p>

<h3>外輪駛滬浙閩綫　結關未獲准許大順康輪在吳淞口被扣　哈立遜總統輪今可抵埠</h3>
<p>前行駛浙閩沿海各口岸之外商航輪、鑒於福州克復以後、爲疏通貨源、準備恢復滬閩航運、曾分向領事署當局及江海關方面要求准予復航、據悉各該船隻、大都係屬英商、美商亦有之、英美兩國駐滬總領事署、對於各輪復航、絕無問題、惟江海關方面始終未准許航輪結關出口、現各航商巳請求領事署當局、轉向江海關接洽、</p>
<p>大順康輪　出口被扣</p>
<p>頃據航業界方而消息、本埠外商前爲謀便利旅客由滬往內地起見、特由法國航商租借怡和公司之大順康輪、擬由滬直放廣州灣、蓋此可使旅客無須經過香港、免去備具入境證等之麻煩、故當時該輪搭客殊見擁擠、乃於本月三日、經江海關准予結關後、即懸掛法國國旗、離滬出口、擬即日直駛廣州灣、詎當駛至吳淞口時、突爲日海軍所扣留、阻撓出口、迄至昨日、已歷九日、仍未予放行、據悉、日海軍此决籍口扣留之原因、除指該輪並未登記外、且須檢查輸出之貨物、故現該輪上之旅客、困居船上、極爲痛苦、</p>

<p>人生</p>
<h3>時間的沙上</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>魔術家的拿手好戲，是「無中生有」或者一來去無踪。」觀衆明知共假，可是因爲魔術家手法敏捷，也祇好信以爲眞。可是不管其眞假，魔術家所變來化去的東西，巳經在觀衆面前發生以娛來賓」的作甩了。</p>
<p>要是你埋身俗務之中，你一時也許沒想到人生來去的匆匆。可是祇要到產科醫院去探訪，再到墳塲上去漫步，你也就可以明白人類是怎樣地排列隊伍到世界上來，叉怎樣地排好行列離開世界。人類的來踪去跡，是像魔術家手上的東西一樣，彷彿得幾乎令人無從追尋。但是，我們也像魔術家手上的東西一樣，在世界上爲時雖暫，我們必須，也必然在我們所佔的時間中與空間上發生作用。至於我們所要發生的是怎樣的作用，那得由我們每個人自己去努力，去決定。</p>
<p>美國詩人朗斐羅有過一首這樣的詩，意譯出來內容是說：</p>
<p>偉人的事蹟吿訴我們，</p>
<p>我們也能使生活崇高，</p>
<p>到我們離開塵世的時候，</p>
<p>在時間的沙上留下腳印</p>
<p>也許在人生的大裏，</p>
<p>有個孤獨遇難的兄弟，</p>
<p>看見了這些深深的脚印，</p>
<p>會再度鼓起生活的勇氣。</p>
<p>所以讓我們奮起努力，</p>
<p>不畏任何命運與患難，</p>
<p>不斷地迫尋，不斷地造就，</p>
<p>學習怎樣勞動，怎樣期待。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>家庭教育</h3>
<p>— 山立</p>
<p>家庭敎育對一個人影響的重大，是無須贅述的了。但說句老實話，在我們中國，對家庭敎育實在太馬虎了。上焉者，父母分工合作，變管齊下，但往往父做紅臉，母作白臉，一面嚇，一面勸，一面打，一面求，所謂嚴父慈母是也。共决，父親忙於對外經商，母親忙於治理家務，於是你不管，我不睬，把敎育子女的責任全付諸學校，自己反不聞而不問。共下焉者，父不父，母不母，子不子，女不女，有錢則送子女讀書，錢無則拉倒；子女高興則讀書，不高興也隨便。父親今天開心，買塊糖果給子女吃吃，不開心拉起來打脫一頓；母親今天快活，燒隻好小菜給于女吃，不快活，就會駡上你一整天。共他惡形惡狀卑鄙齷齪之事，父母在子女而前亦無所不作，無所不爲也。</p>
<p>上述三種都是不良的家庭敎育，所差不過程度之深淺而已。在此種不良的家庭敎育之下，要想產生出一個賢能有爲的子女來，當然是很困難的了。但一旦子女長成後，不肖不孝，不才，不能，做父母的却又要怨大尤人，以爲祖上缺德，所以出此種不肖子孫。其實，子女好，父母固可自豪；子女不好，父母自也不可辭其咎。而父母要子女好不好，先應該看自己敎育得良不良，至於學校敎育，那還在其次。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我想起了一件事，有關家庭敎育，姑記之以爲結束：</p>
<p>「百合要買百合！」</p>
<p>「媽！外面在喊賣百合，我們去買些燒百合湯好麼？」在寫字的阿大忽然地說。</p>
<p>「好的！」母親剛說完，二個兒子急忙拉著她直回門外走去。</p>
<p>買百合時，母親與小販加些，搶些，秤頭鮮些，蹺些，爭執了多時。而兩個兒子呢，自也有他們的工作：只要賣百合的眼睛一歪，身子一轉，阿大二隻，阿二一隻，手快脚快，早巳溜進了屋子。一會兒，母親買了百合回來了，看見阿大手裏拿了二隻百合，阿二一隻，只慢慢地走過去把三隻白合放進籃裏，如沒有這事一樣。</p>
<p>二小時後，百合湯燒好了</p>
<p>「媽！哥哥吃三碗，我也要吃三碗。」阿二不服氣地說。</p>
<p>「哥哥多吃一碗，因爲他比你多拿一隻白合。」</p>
<p>媽的回答使阿大得意地微笑。</p>
<p>「我下决也會多拿的。」阿二忿忿地說。</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>哲學家</h3>
<p>— 侯放</p>
<p>曾經聽過一個故事：</p>
<p>哲學家有一次搭船旅行在船上他和人聚起談天。</p>
<p>「先生，你懂得藝術嗎？」哲學家問。</p>
<p>「不懂，」那個人答。</p>
<p>「那麼你的人生去了三分一，還有，請問你懂得科學嗎？」</p>
<p>「也不懂。」</p>
<p>「那麼你的人生又去了三分一。」</p>
<p>這麼說着，忽然大家嚷着沉船，那人不慌不忙的問誓學家說：</p>
<p>「先生，你會游水嗎？」</p>
<p>「不會。」</p>
<p>「那麼你去了整個人生了。」</p>
<p>理論離開了實際，學問離開了現實，都是可哀的事。沉船是哲學家的不幸，他沒有學會游水，他沒有時問來學游水，他現在會浸死了。不過，不知道那位哲學家有沒有晦氣，如果他處之泰然，準備拿一條木板逃出，則他是一個眞正的哲學家。</p>
<p>其實，有學問者的遭遇往往如此可哀，他離開現實太遠，他得不到社會的同情而為社會所迫害，不過，我希望他們始終奮鬥着，「造决顚沛必於斯」有何怨言！</p>

<h3>魚雷槍</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>大的美國人士，在這擾攘的世局中，已經不敢再抱高枕而臥的妄想了。雖然還有）部份孤立派的駝鳥，想用埋首沙中的策略來欺已欺人，然而大多數美國民衆的頭腦是淸醒的。他們知道在這狹小的世界上，他們無法「獨善其身」，所以不但對於各抵抗侵略的民主國，竭力援助，就是對於自己東西二　的防務，也進行不遺餘力。在最近沿海防務的發明中，有一種魚雷槍，是由鋼架所造成的，可以安置在普通的小快艇上，能够放射小型的魚雷。有人提議在將來一旦戰事爆發，美國所有私家的遊艇，都可以趕這種新武器，爲國效勞。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>方校長吿訴他說：小狗子因爲在城裏找了半個多月，始終找不到梅寳這個人，沒奈何祇得依舊去見劉禿子；可是他很聰明，知道公安局傳了他去也問不出什麼話來，便決定不再跟他硬挺，只一味向他軟求。不知道他說了些什麼話，竟把那個性格粗魯而並不刁滑的劉禿子感動了，他老老實實的說自己對於這件事委實沒有份，不過據他所知道，人是眞給尙老二騙走的此刻帶往北平。最後，他又給小狗子開了一個不很詳細的地址，因此小狗子已連夜趕上北平去了。旅費是方校長自已幫助了他十塊錢。……</p>
<p>「好了，三爺，姑娘總算有消息了！」小狗子的兄弟張老六聽到這件事，便忙着再向秋海棠安慰。「憑我哥哥那份死心眼兒的脾氣，找不到人是不會回來的。你老人家還是寬下心，好好地養息養息，等候他們回來吧！」</p>
<p>因爲小狗子這樣的忠義，秋海棠的心裏倒也頓時樂觀起來。</p>
<p>「你哥哥眞好，但願他能够把梅寳找回來，以後我永遠就當他像兄弟一樣的看待！」他很難得地打臉上透出了一絲笑容說。</p>
<p>從此，他果然略略寬心了些，只屈着指頭，每天計算小狗子的行程。（二一〇）</p>

<h3>從燕子箋追想到　崑曲敎師陣鳳鳴</h3>
<p>— 施以仁</p>
<p>燕子箋爲有名之傳奇，流行至今，曲譜所載，僅存四折：一曰寫像，二曰拾箋，三曰姦遁，即王傳淞所演狗洞，在李香君影片中見過，四曰誥圓，全係生旦正塲，非得到風度翩翩，顧影生情者不能稱化境也。近來京朝派亦有排演是劇，王桂秋來滬，一度曾露布戲目，却未實演，惟越劇已露演數次，頗得觀衆稱許。原書明末阮大鋮撰，會乞王鐸書詞箋，進呈弘光帝，帝大悅，又屬家伶扮演，一時金陵上官，碩彥名士，無不譽美。王漁洋詩：「新歌細字寫冰紈，小部君王帶笑看；千載秦准嗚咽水，不應仍恨孔都官。」蓋東林復社相爭，漸至明室傾覆，孔尙任桃花扇實紀其事也。</p>
<p>陳鳳鳴係扇子生，琴挑，亭會，梳妝，跪池等戲，皆所擅長，與陸壽卿，施桂林，沈磐生，尤彩雲，同爲蘇派上角。步口咬字，極能準切，凡上塲臺角之顧盼，手指之舉勢，水袖之飄曳，皆守一定尺寸，無絲毫亂規，演拾箋至霍都梁仰見燕干歸來，隨風往還之時，目光斜睨，情景逼眞。五十後蓄鬚悟道，屏絕歌塲，膺海上平聲曲社之聘，與票友相切磋，今社中葛緝甫之亭會，莊一拂之醉妃，沈恒一朱堯文之見娘，皆得此公陶冶之力。六十以後，兼授生徒，海寗沈三明得其眞傳，擫笛甚工，規制派別，一如其師，爲鳳鳴得意子弟，晚年杜門不出，事變後流離困頓，憔悴以終。</p>

<h3>俞振飛下海之經過　（下）</h3>
<p>— 少閒（自北平寄）</p>
<p>又荃初意遏雲玉華二人必能與硯秋一較短長，孰料今日之硯秋仍然硯秋，遏雲玉華皆未能與叉荃合作到底，（倒是琴師穆鐵芬，自離硯秋後，始終爲遏雲操琴）。而又荃則身敗名裂，以至不可收拾之地步。（此人頗多妙事，容當另文述之。）再說到硯秋呢，自王又荃倒戈後，即邀請姜妙香合作，妙香爲此中能手，與硯秋搭配自能勝任愉快。惟妙香爲梅蘭芳之配角，不時隨蘭芳出外演劇，未能與硯秋長期合作，硯秋有鑒於此，乃決計另覓賢材，時在民國二十三年，硯秋以友誼敦請俞振飛下海合作。時振飛方走票海上，原無下海意，弟以各方友好紛紛勸駕，硯秋復對振飛執禮甚恭，願厚待之，振飛卒爲所動，惟變方的法三章：（一）振飛每演一戲，戲份若干，月演八塲戲，不滿八塲戲，亦作八塲戲算。（二）對振飛之一切，得優於儕輩；（三）振飛有不滿意處，得隨時發表意見。是年雙方即在如此協定之下，携手合作，振飛即在此時正式下海，與硯秋在平同台出演。硯秋對振飛確眞另眼看待，而振飛對硯秋亦有知過之感，硯秋崑腔戲得振飛指點處不少，同時因振飛之精通文墨，硯秋出外演戲，振飛更兼掌宣傳文書等任。是故雙方情感彌篤，孰料美景不長，後來竟致拆擋，拆擋之原因，究竟從何而起，請看下文，便知底蘊。</p>

<p>高盛麟，慶奎子也。當慶奎盛時，盛麟藉父提掖，碌碌無所表見，迨慶奎嗓音蹋中，始乃淬勵攻苦，冀以擼拄門戶，淑艾小樓，致力至勤，曾未幾時，竟颕脫儕輩間，嶄然露頭角，而小樓亦且溘逝，不及導之徑登堂奧焉。盛麟之學小樓，謹守繩墨，殊中矩度，且嗓音淸亮，亦有依稀之似；雖小樓精微深造，邈若萬里之程，非後生勉强所能遽至，而盛麟猶存其風格之什一，固已難得，處庸中稱俊矣。惟盛麟近來登場，頗病於憊怠，意若謂小樓夙以刁懶名，故遂刻意效之也。小樓中年演戯偶犯鬆懈，至暮境反力袪此弊，氣力時或不逮則有之，非故作此態以向人也。今盛麟於小樓之美，未能一一皆備，僅僅惟「懶是務，不啻自封故步，止於所不當止，深爲斯可造之材惜之！</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>第十六章　早携嬌鳥出樊籠</p>
<p>看看天色巳黑，邸中各處俱巳點上明燈，下人入報吳總兵駕到。田宏遇慌忙開正門出迎。見吳三桂戎服臨筵，帶了四名護兵儼然有不可侵犯之色，心裏不由一怔。恭恭敬敬的把他招接到四維堂上，賓主坐定後，又略叙幾句客套。吳三桂見一個女樂也沒有，便故意說道：「今晚登門是答謝國丈的盛意，戎裝在身，不便多坐，便要吿辭。」田宏遇道:「難得央將軍到此，蓬蓽生輝，正要杯酒小叙，一傾衷情，何叉忽忽欲去？尙望將軍旣來之則安之，小坐片刻。」三桂微頷其首。田宏遇遂又引導三桂走至紅情軒中去坐席。軒裏燈燭輝煌，四壁華麗，宛如小小的皇宮，正中放着一桌豐盛的酒席。田宏遇請三桂上坐，三桂略一謙讓，即坐在賓位上首，游目四顧，果然富麗動人。田宏遇平時有這等供養，很不容易，可惜天下大亂，京師不安，朝晚間這種享樂也恐難保長久呢。田宏遇斟過酒後，便吩咐女樂來此伺候。一會兒環珮可噹，衣裳綷　，一隊女樂已緩緩行來，香風四溢，撲人鼻管。吳三桂舉目望去時，只見前面兩個垂髮少女，提了兩盞茜色紗燈，背後便有一二十個姬妾，都是綺年玉貌，皓齒明眸，綺裳羅衣，雲鬟翠鬢，手中握着各種絲竹樂器，端的難得瞧見。走進軒來，向田宏遇吳三桂二人檢袵爲禮，移步過去，坐在一旁，宛如衆香國裏名葩吐艷。田宏遇遂回頭吩咐他們先奏一曲淸平樂。絲竹旣調，衆音並奏，渢渢洋洋，悠揚動聽。淸平樂奏罷，又奏一闋霓裳仙子，果然蕩人心魂。（一六九）</p>

In effect, our forces will closely cooperate with the British and Allied navies and aircraft. This means our warships and aircraft will use British and Allied bases at any time and anywhere. The majority of our forces will naturally use battleships or enter the Mediterranean Sea and other sea areas. According to President Roosevelt's orders, our military commanders will independently and jointly with the British search for German and Italian ships. The large-scale maritime search we are currently engaged in will be largely limited to routes transporting Lend-Lease military supplies to Britain and South Africa, as well as routes in the Pacific Ocean to Vladivostok, Rangoon, and the Red Sea. Routes to Australia and from Australia to Singapore, India, and African ports may also require limited patrols.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Roosevelt's Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th: In his eagerly awaited broadcast last night, President Roosevelt warned Germany and Italy that their warships would face danger if they entered the American defense sea lanes. He said, "I have issued instructions to the commanders-in-chief of the U.S. Army and Navy to implement this policy immediately. The full responsibility rests with Germany. There will be no shooting unless Germany continues to provoke it." The President stated that a German submarine first fired at the American destroyer Greer, intending to sink it. This is a fact, and from a legal and moral standpoint, it constitutes an act of piracy. This is not an isolated incident but part of an overall plan. In July, a submarine in North American territorial waters followed an American warship, attempting to position itself for an attack. Its periscope was clearly visible. At that time, there were no British or American submarines within a hundred miles, so the nationality of this submarine was evident. Nazi submarines are the rattlesnakes of the Mediterranean, and now is the time for active defense." The President continued, "We have not sought a shooting war with Hitler, and we still do not want to seek one. But we also do not want to seek peace at the cost of allowing our naval vessels to be attacked by Hitler while performing their duties. The Nazis want to abolish freedom of the seas and seize absolute control of the oceans. This is an act of lawlessness. If the Nazis were to seize control of the oceans, their second step would be evident: to control the United States and the Western Hemisphere by force. I have no illusions about the seriousness of this step. It is unavoidable for the protection of the nation. The invincibility of the U.S. Navy is only true when the British Navy exists. The traditional policy of American maritime freedom still applies, not only in the Atlantic but also in the Pacific and other oceans. American defense vessels will again wait for the Axis powers to attack first."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th: The full text of President Roosevelt's broadcast is as follows: "According to a report from the U.S. Navy Department, the American destroyer Greer, while en route to Iceland in broad daylight, was attacked on the morning of September 4th at a location southeast of Greenland. The ship was carrying U.S. mail to Iceland, flying the American flag, and its identity as an American vessel was unmistakable. At that time, the ship was attacked by a submarine, which Germany admits was a German submarine. The submarine deliberately fired one torpedo at the Greer, followed by another, to launch an attack. Despite the fabrications of Hitler's propaganda machine and the willingness of some anti-American groups to believe their words, I must inform you of the blunt facts: the German submarine fired on this American destroyer without warning, intending to sink it. Our destroyer was sailing in the area of self-defense declared by the U.S. government, the American protective outposts in the Atlantic. We have established outposts in Iceland, Greenland, Labrador, and Newfoundland in the north. Many ships flying the flags of various nations sail through this sea, carrying food and other supplies for civilians, and war materials. These war materials were created by the American people at the cost of billions of dollars and declared necessary by the actions of Congress to defend their own land."</p>
<h3>Policy of Attacking American Ships is an Act of Piracy</h3>
<p>When the American destroyer was attacked, it was fulfilling its legitimate mission. If the submarine could see the destroyer when it fired the torpedoes, then the attack was a deliberate attempt by the Nazis to sink a clearly identifiable American warship. If, on the other hand, the submarine was submerged, unwilling to take the trouble to ascertain the nationality of the ship, and fired torpedoes based on sounds picked up by hydrophones, as claimed in the German communiqué, then the attack is even more brutal, as it indicates a policy of indiscriminate destruction against any ship at sea, whether belligerent or non-belligerent. This is an act of piracy. From a legal and moral standpoint, this is not the first or the last act of piracy committed by the Nazi government against the American flag in this war. Attacks have occurred one after another. A month ago, the American-flagged merchant ship Robin Moor, sailing in the mid-South Atlantic, was sunk by a Nazi submarine in a situation violating established international law and humanitarian principles. The ship's passengers and crew were forced into open boats hundreds of miles from land. This is a direct violation of international treaties signed by the German government. The Nazi government has not offered an apology, claimed it was a mistake, or offered compensation for the losses. In July 1941, an American warship sailing in North American waters was followed by a submarine, which for a long time tried to position itself for an attack. Its periscope was visible above the surface. At that time, there were no British or American submarines within hundreds of miles, so the nationality of this submarine was evident. Five days ago, we learned that the merchant ship Sessa, flying the flag of our sister republic, Panama, had been sunk. Only three survivors remain. On August 17th, the ship was attacked without warning, first by a torpedo and then bombarded near Greenland. It was carrying supplies for the civilian population of Iceland. It is now feared that the other sailors on board have drowned. The fact that German submarines were operating in that area has been confirmed, so there is no reasonable doubt about the nationality of the attacking submarine. Five days ago, another American merchant ship, the Steel Seafarer, while sailing to a port in Egypt, was sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea, 220 miles south of Suez. A total of four ships flying the American flag have been definitively confirmed as sunk or lost, two of which were U.S. Navy warships. The fifth ship sunk clearly flew the flag of Panama. We Americans are now standing firm in the face of this situation. The form of our democratic civilization has fostered a feeling that any nation that commits an act of piracy against one of our ships must be at war with us. We are not now panicked or losing our sense of balance, so what I am thinking and saying now is not about any incidental details. We Americans are now taking a long-term view of certain fundamental principles and the succession of events on land and sea. This must be seen as a whole and as part of world events.</p>
<h3>Nazi Conspiracy and Deception Exposed</h3>
<p>A great nation does not deign to exaggerate a minor incident or become uncontrollably angry over an act of violence, but the evidence in this case is conclusive and shows that it is not accidental but part of an overall plan. Therefore, it would be an unpardonable folly to underestimate its impact. The important truth is that this kind of international lawlessness exposes a plan that the American people have long understood: the Nazi plan to abolish freedom of the seas and seize absolute control of the oceans. Once that control is in their hands, the next step, to control the United States and the Western Hemisphere by force, can proceed unhindered. With the ocean under Nazi control, the Americans or any American republic</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Initial Completion of Foreign Exchange Controls</h3>
<p>The freezing of funds by Britain and the United States, after a month of arrangements, is now showing signs of progress. This also relies on the persuasive efforts of the British and American governments. Otherwise, the black market exchange rates, with mutual exploitation, could never be eliminated. However, whether this elimination can proceed without complications and be fully implemented remains to be seen and proven by facts. It is still too early to expect it. However, the matter is not difficult. What is called foreign exchange in the market is actually only one type: the U.S. dollar. The clearing of U.S. dollars should be controlled by the New York market. Without exceptions, all inflows and outflows are subject to its control. There is no need to worry about stray U.S. dollars, and there is no room for division. Therefore, the receipt and disbursement of foreign exchange in Shanghai only require British and American banks to have the determination to maintain and promote it. Even if one wants to cause trouble, it is difficult to achieve. If the black market is completely eliminated, and the foreign exchange receipts and disbursements are centrally managed by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, those who believe that the legal tender has lost its freedom to buy and sell foreign exchange and has therefore lost all its value are greatly mistaken. The exchange of legal tender for British and American currencies does not depend on whether buying and selling is free or restricted to increase or decrease its value. After being controlled, there can be a fixed exchange rate, unlike the black market, which changes in an instant. Some say that because only a portion of goods can be settled in foreign exchange, the legal tender only has a portion of its function. This is also a convoluted argument. The fact that a portion of goods can be settled in foreign exchange and a portion cannot is a matter of selecting goods, not a matter of the effectiveness of the legal tender. The legal tender does not specify that a certain portion can buy foreign exchange and a certain portion cannot. As long as it is legal tender, all of it can be used to purchase foreign exchange. This is the true value of the legal tender, meaning that every bill has the potential to purchase foreign exchange. Moreover, because of the elimination of the black market, the exchange rate is pegged at a reasonable level, and therefore prices can also be maintained at a reasonable standard. This is of great benefit to stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Now, the goods supplied with foreign exchange are extraordinarily broad, not only considering the lives of the people of Shanghai but also their enjoyment, not only considering the materials for industrial operations but also the machinery for industrial development. However, those who are extravagant in their own consumption and unwilling to spend a penny for public service, those who only seek enjoyment and disregard public welfare, still think it is not enough. Those who seek to profit through arbitrage feel inconvenienced and constantly think of undermining it. Even those who speculate and manipulate also feel that the elimination of the black market makes their actions inconvenient and harbor jealousy and resentment. These are all generated from outside and cannot be reasoned with human emotion or rationality. In the future, the trend of prices will be less influenced by currency values and more influenced by artificial manipulation. For example, (1) goods that are not supplied with foreign exchange will inevitably rise arbitrarily to facilitate hoarding and speculation; (2) even knowing that there is a supply, they will also use the prices of goods not supplied as an example to raise prices step by step; (3) those who demand goods do not know which goods sold in the market should be cheap and which are expensive, so distributors can still use their usual tricks to muddy the waters. If so, the so-called foreign exchange control still benefits industry and commerce at the expense of the people's livelihood. Although the purpose of control is not for prices, the effect of control also includes adjusting prices. If the facts are indeed like this, it is regrettable.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is believed that the items listed in Schedule A, such as rice, coal, and petroleum products, are essential for daily life. On the one hand, they must be supplied with foreign exchange, and on the other hand, their prices should also be controlled. For example, since the Shanghai Municipal Council has been selling rice publicly, perhaps due to cost factors, the publicly set price is sometimes higher than the market price, leading to the malpractice of mixing low-quality rice with publicly sold rice to sell for profit. This still seems to be a technical issue of procurement and sales and is not enough to be a problem with publicly sold rice. Since the Municipal Council's rice came into existence, it has indeed made it difficult for the rice market to be manipulated effectively, and the adjustment of rice prices has made some progress. Its contribution cannot be denied. Therefore, the foreign exchange supplied for imported rice should be limited to the rice sold publicly by the Municipal Council so that the Municipal Council has the real power to control food in the concession! Because the Municipal Council operates rice sales not for profit, its goal is not to make money. To gain the trust of the public, the Municipal Council should also publish the amount of rice ordered in batches, the cost of the assessment, and the profit or loss of the sales situation every month or every period to demonstrate trustworthiness and silence the mouths of unscrupulous merchants. Coal briquettes made from briquettes and coal dust have become the only fuel in the city. Next is kerosene, and a portion is used for lighting. In addition, there is bituminous coal for factory food and coal dust for cooked water shops, all of which have a deep relationship with people's daily lives. The traditional sales method of foreign firms and coal merchants is to sell in bulk and not focus on retail sales, which uses warehouse receipts and puts the coal into the hands of wealthy hoarders and coal merchants. Real consumers, when they have a need, cannot obtain it or obtain it at an exorbitant price, and the great profit goes to the merchants, while the harm extends to the poor. Now that foreign exchange is supplied, prices should be stabilized, and the distribution method should be reformed. The only way to do this is to stop the trading of warehouse receipts to prevent manipulation and hoarding. The only way is to focus on the current sales of door-to-door shops to prevent stores from profiting at the expense of others. The only way is to also meet the needs of users. Then, it can actually enter the hands of consumers and reduce the burden of general life. Kerosene is not as important as coal, but it is still a daily necessity for the people. Since coal has become expensive, more and more small families use kerosene for cooking, and because electricity is expensive, many are switching to kerosene lamps. The price of kerosene seems to be restrained by the kerosene companies, unlike the wild jumps in coal prices, but it is still more than ten times what it used to be. Therefore, efforts should be made to distribute it to consumers in a fair manner, and the high profits should not be used for the extravagance of hoarders. Tobacco leaves are merely for consumption, but they are listed alongside rice and coal, which is only for the enjoyment of the general public and the businesses of British and American friendly nations. However, when allocating foreign exchange, they should not be treated equally with rice and coal.</p>
<p>As for the position of legal tender, it is a matter of deep concern to the general public. In fact, it is more worrying about whether the loopholes are closed than worrying about them not being closed. This does not require deep discussion. Just ask about family expenses and managing a household economically. Spending one less penny will save one more penny of the property they hold. On the contrary, if they spend without restraint, their property will decrease day by day and eventually go bankrupt. What's more, if they don't spend enough for themselves and also supply it to others, exhaustion can be expected soon. When they realize that spending is inappropriate and think about budgeting and preventing others from encroaching, then only strict receipts and disbursements will not be in vain. If receipts and disbursements are strict, and consumption is limited, should they worry that the value of the property is not as high as before? Therefore, the value of legal tender, after the success of this foreign exchange control, will become more solid. The value will rise without asking, and they will see the coming of success and know that worrying is unnecessary.  merchant ships, unable to rely on the freedom to do any peaceful commerce except by relying on the despotic power of that foreign nation. The Atlantic, which had been and would always be the channel of our freedom and friendship, would thus become a deadly threat to American commerce, American seacoasts, and American inland cities. The Hitler government, in violation of maritime law and the publicly recognized rights enjoyed by other nations, has declared a vast area of the ocean, including even the vast waters in the Western Hemisphere, to be blockaded. Ships may not enter that area for any reason without risking being sunk. If the military actually now arbitrarily sinks ships in a wide area, both within and far beyond the self-declared blockade zone, without warning, this Nazi attempt to seize control of the oceans is only a coordinated part of the Nazi conspiracy to implement in its entirety in the Western Hemisphere. Everything is moving towards the same goal. The vanguards of Hitler, not only his acknowledged secret agents but also the quislings he has placed among us, have prepared footholds and bridgeheads in the New World for him to use once he seizes control of the oceans.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is fully aware of Hitler's conspiracy and deceptions in this New World. Coup plots have occurred one after another. Last year, there was an attempt to seize the government of Uruguay, which was fortunately thwarted by that country's swift and decisive action, with full assistance from its American neighbors. Not long ago, there was another attempt to foment unrest in Argentina, which was thwarted by that government's meticulous and clever efforts in various locations. Not long ago, there was also an attempt to undermine the government of Bolivia. In recent weeks, secret landing strips for aircraft have been discovered in several locations within the borders of Colombia near the Panama Canal.</p>
<h3>U.S. Determined to Exert Every Effort to Maintain Freedom of the Seas</h3>
<p>I can cite many more cases. Hitler knows that to succeed as the master of the world, he must seize control of the oceans. He must first destroy the bridge of ships that we have built across the Atlantic, on which we continuously transport war materials to help Britain eliminate its people and all its works. He must remove our patrols on the sea and in the sky. He must silence the British Navy. The American people, believing that the U.S. Navy is capable of protecting the country and is invincible, must be repeatedly reminded that this is only effective if the British Navy survives. This is simple arithmetic. If the world outside the Americas were destroyed under the Axis powers, the Axis countries would enjoy the shipbuilding facilities of all of Europe, the British Isles, and the Far East, far surpassing all the shipbuilding facilities and potential of the Americas. Not only would it surpass them, but it would also be two or three times greater. At that time, even if the United States devoted all its resources to dealing with this situation, seeking to double or redouble our navy, the manpower and resources of the Axis countries controlling the rest of the world would still be able to build many times more than us. It is time for all Americans in the Americas to end their illusion that the Americas can continue to live a happy and peaceful life in a Nazi-controlled world. The United States has fought for the policy of freedom of the seas throughout its history. This policy is very simple, but fundamentally important. Its meaning is that no country has the right to prevent other countries from safely conducting commerce in the vast oceans of the world, far from the battlefields on land. This is our policy, and it has been repeatedly proven throughout our history. Our policy has been implemented from time immemorial to the present, and it will continue to be implemented in the future, not only in the Atlantic but also in the Pacific and other oceans. The unrestricted submarine warfare of 1941 has become a blatant act of aggression against American policy. Hitler has begun his war to dominate the oceans with violence and by sweeping aside all international law and humanity. His intention is very clear. The American people can no longer have any illusions about this. All the sweet whispers of the appeasers that Hitler is not interested in the Western Hemisphere and the lullabies that the ocean will protect us from Hitler's aggression can no longer have any influence on the clear-headed, far-sighted, and realistic American people.</p>
<h3>Defend Defensive Bastions at Any Cost</h3>
<p>Because of the above-mentioned events, because of the actions of German ships, and because of the repeatedly clear evidence of the German government's disrespect for treaties or international law and its disregard for neutral nations or human life, we Americans are now faced with cruel facts, not abstract theories. The attack on the Greer is not a localized military action in the Atlantic. It is not merely an encounter in a conflict between two countries but a step towards creating a perpetual world order based on armed intimidation and massacre. I know that the Nazis are even now watching to see if the United States will silently signal a green light and allow them to continue on their path of destruction. The danger to our Western Hemisphere from the Nazis is no longer just a possibility but has arrived, not only from military enemies but also from enemies of all laws, all freedoms, and all religions. The time has come when you and I must see the cold necessity and warn this inhuman, unrestrained seeker of world domination for profit, "You want to place our children in your way of terror and slavery. Now that you have attacked our security, we cannot allow you to go any further." Ordinary diplomatic practices, such as documents, are useless when dealing with international thugs who destroy our ships and kill our people. Peaceful nations have been harmed one after another simply because they failed to recognize the Nazi danger before their throats were strangled. The United States does not want to repeat this mistake. No act of violence or intimidation can prevent us from maintaining the integrity of our two great defensive bastions: one, the supply lines of raw materials to the enemies of Hitler; and two, the freedom of our shipping on the high seas. Whatever action is required, whatever the cost, we must keep the legal trade lines in this defensive ocean open at all times. We have not sought a shooting war with Hitler, and we do not seek one now. But we also do not want to seek peace at the cost of allowing Hitler to attack our warships and merchant ships engaged in legitimate business. I believe that German leaders may not pay close attention to what we Americans say about them. We cannot bring about the downfall of Nazism with long-distance insults, but if you see a rattlesnake about to attack you, you must destroy it before it can inflict its venom. Nazi submarines and plunderers are the rattlesnakes of the Atlantic. They are a danger to the free armies on the high seas. They are a challenge to our sovereignty. Their attacks on ships flying the American flag are trampling on our most precious rights. The American flag is a symbol of our independence, our freedom, and our lives. All of us Americans understand that the time has come for Americans to defend themselves. If we allow the Nazis to continue attacking us in our own territorial waters or in the ocean where they can continue to attack us, it will weaken America's ability to reject Hitlerism. Let us not make too fine a distinction. Let us not, after the fifth or tenth or twentieth attack, ask ourselves when we should begin to defend ourselves. In fact, the time for active self-defense has come. Let us not split hairs. Let us not say, "We might as well wait until a torpedo has sunk an American ship or the crew and passengers have drowned before we try to defend ourselves." It is time to prevent attacks.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Axis Warships - Impart a Fatal Blow Immediately</h3>
<p>Submarines or pirate ships can attack in the open sea, and they can also attack close to our coasts. Their appearance in the Americas, regarded as seas vital to defense, constitutes an attack. Our American ships and aircraft, in what we consider necessary for defense at sea, will no longer wait for Axis submarines lurking underwater or Axis pirate ships floating on the surface to strike the first fatal blow. Currently, our large naval and air patrols patrolling the vast Atlantic Ocean are responsible for the policy of freedom of the seas for the Americas. In simple and clear terms, this means that our patrolling warships and aircraft will protect all merchant ships. All vessels operating in our defensive waters and engaging in commerce, not only those flying the American flag but also those flying any national flag, are under protection. We will protect them from attacks by submarines and pirate ships. This situation is not new. The second U.S. President Adams once ordered the U.S. Navy to eliminate European warships harassing our Caribbean and South American seas and destroying our commerce. And the third President Jefferson also ordered the U.S. Navy to stop attacks by North African pirates on American ships. My responsibility as President is historical, obvious, and unavoidable. Our decision to protect the seas necessary for the defense of the Americas is not an act of war on our part. Our actions are not aggression, but defense. However, this warning should be made clear.</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases - Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>From September 5th to 11th - Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the war situation for the week (September 5th to 11th). The recapture of Fuzhou City is the most noteworthy. Secondly, the Japanese army's rampant harassment in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border area, the Chinese army's attacks and harassment in the Jinan triangle area, and the Chinese army's enticement of the Japanese army to penetrate deeply into Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan are also briefly reported. The details are described below:</p>
<p>(Recapture of) Fuzhou (and other places): (1) On the night of the 2nd, the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Fuzhou, capturing the entrance by midnight. The Japanese army in Fuzhou boarded ships one after another and began to retreat eastward on the morning of the 3rd. On the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army entered Fuzhou City and continued to pursue eastward, capturing Mawei at 3 PM. (2) Fuqing, on the south bank of the Min River, was captured and then lost again, and finally, on the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army was driven out of the city and retreated from the estuary by ship. Changle was also recovered at the same time. (3) Lianjiang, on the north bank of the Min River, was also captured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 3rd. The Japanese army retreated to Changmen and Guanwangtou on the riverbank. (4) The Japanese army, which landed at Sandu Ao on August 30th, attempted to抄襲 [pinyin: chāoxí; meaning to plagiarize or copy] the rear of the Chinese field army outside Fuzhou, fought with the Chinese army until noon on the 3rd, and also boarded Japanese ships and retreated.</p>
<p>(Jiangsu-Zhejiang) Border Area: In the previous offensive by the various field armies on the East China battlefield, the damage inflicted on the Japanese army was greater in the attacks on Changxing and Wukang. In order to retaliate, the Japanese army gathered more than 4,000 troops and launched attacks from Changxing, Wuxing, and Wukang in three directions westward towards the Chinese Northern Jiangsu field army's location. The northern route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, passed through Lincheng Bridge to Guantai from Weixing at 6 PM on the 31st, and on the morning of the 1st, turned south to attack Meixi Town, and at the same time attacked Guanyintang in the north of Anji County, but was blocked. On the evening of the 2nd, they turned southeast and attacked Qiankeng Bridge. The central route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, launched attacks from Changxing in the afternoon of the 1st in separate groups westward towards Gangkou and Heping towns, then converged to attack Wucun, and continued to reinforce with more than 1,000 troops, attacking Xiaozhen westward at noon on the 2nd, and also turned south to Qiankeng Bridge in the evening to join the northern route and attack the Chinese army. The northern route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, attacked Paitou Town westward from Wukang at 6 PM on the 2nd as a supporting force. The Chinese army relied on the advantageous terrain around Qiankeng Bridge, waited for the Japanese to arrive, and launched a fierce attack. One group that attacked Chiwucun was also surrounded by the Chinese army. Fighting until the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese army at Qiankeng Bridge could not hold out and retreated southeast towards Wukang. The group at Chiwucun also broke through the encirclement and retreated. The Chinese army pursued them in separate routes.</p>
<p>(Jinan) Triangle Area: On the evening of the 28th of last month, a part of the Japanese army in Ruicheng attacked Wangyao Village and Fozi Village to the north, and in the morning moved east through Dongxishan and Yangjia Village to attack Majia Yao and Yongxing Yao. In the afternoon of the 29th, the Japanese army in Monan Town moved west through Shihe Yao and joined the attack. In the evening, the Japanese army in Yuxiang and Qinghua Towns also moved south, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. The Chinese army met the enemy on different routes and fought fiercely for three days, driving back the Japanese army. At midnight on the 20th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched an attack on the area from Yanhe Yue Village to Renjiadian southwest of Ruicheng, destroying the Japanese army's communication equipment. Five Japanese ammunition vehicles touched Chinese mines at Renjiadian and were completely destroyed. On the morning of the 3rd, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Dali Village, a Japanese stronghold south of Yanchi. Fighting until noon, the Japanese army could not hold out and retreated to the south of the village. Subsequently, more than 1,000 Japanese troops reinforced in four routes, one route from Anyi via the east, one route from Yuncheng via Yanchi, one route from Balu via Fengxiekou, and one route from Zhangcun via Dalangmiao, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. After fierce fighting by the Chinese, the Japanese formation was completely scattered. The Chinese army has now shifted from the inner line to the outer line and is counterattacking the Japanese.</p>
<p>(Northern Hunan) Chinese Army Entices Japanese to Deeply Penetrate Dayun Mountain: More than 10,000 Japanese troops in northern Hunan began to harass on the 7th. One group attacked Nanshan Yanling from Zhongfang, one group attacked Jipoling from Taolin Xitang to the south, and another group went to the Shenjiashan area on the southern foothills of Nanchong Gantian, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Chinese field army in Dayun Mountain. The Chinese army took advantage of the terrain to lure the Japanese into the mountains, shifting from the core to launch a counter-encirclement against the Japanese. From midnight on the 8th, they launched a fierce battle against the Japanese. In addition,</p>
<p>(Northern Jiangxi) More than 20 Japanese troops in Anyi also harassed in separate groups on the morning of the 3rd. One group attempted to cross the Tie Long Pass to the south and attacked Songbu, and one group forcibly crossed the Huangjia Zhou and harassed Yanzhi Mountain. On the 6th, the Chinese army once captured Songbu, but the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are fighting in the Jiulong Xiao area.

<h3>Authorities Will Consider Adjusting Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to news here, Chinese authorities may consider adjusting exchange rates to facilitate the transfer of the exchange market from Hong Kong and Shanghai to the mainland. It is expected that once the adjustment plan is completed, the premium on the Shanghai exchange rate will be reduced. (12th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Dark Age in the Midst of Strenuous Fighting - China Has Apparently Survived / Those Who Underestimate China Will Eventually Regret It</h3>
<p>London - Mr. Woodhead, the General Manager of the 福 [Fu] Company, recently stated that the Chinese government has appointed the company as its agent to purchase goods in the Sterling Area (excluding the United Kingdom) with a British loan of £5 million to China. With the reopening of the Burma Road, and loans from Britain and the United States, China has apparently survived the darkest period of its courageous struggle. Those who underestimate China will one day regret it. However, the establishment of bases by Vietnam along the Yunnan provincial border allows Japan to use army bombers in addition to naval bombers to disrupt the Burma Road and Chongqing. The Fu Company's business in Sichuan Province is difficult to operate due to prices being ten times higher than usual, but the situation now seems stable, and prices have gradually stabilized. The Fu Company's plan to participate in the development of coal and iron in Yunnan Province has been abandoned due to the suspension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. (11th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>China Industrial Trust Company - Preparations Completed</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The China Industrial Trust Company, funded and established by Du Yuesheng, has completed its preparations. It has been decided to set up two enterprises and four departments: banking, trust, and trade. Du will serve as chairman and general manager. (11th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Gasoline in Tianjin - Supply Restricted</h3>
<p>Tianjin - The French-language Beijing Daily recently reported that the Asiatic Petroleum Company announced that gasoline supply to private cars at gas stations will be limited to a maximum of ten gallons per month. It is also heard that this restriction will also be implemented in Peiping. (11th dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>know. From now on, if German or Italian warships enter the oceans necessary for the protection of American defenses, they are simply inviting danger. The order I, as Commander-in-Chief, am issuing to the United States Army and Navy is to immediately implement this policy. The entire responsibility rests with Germany. Unless Germany seeks to be fired upon, there will be no firing. This is my clear duty in this critical situation. This is the clear right of our sovereign nation. This is the only step we can take to maintain our defensive barrier, for we have undertaken to maintain the defenses around the Western Hemisphere. I have not underestimated the importance of this step. I have not taken it lightly. This is the result of months of constant thought, anxiety, and prayer. It is unavoidable in protecting your nation and mine. The American people will face this serious crisis in their history with American perseverance and American determination, just as they always have. They all know the reality of the attacks we have suffered. They all know the necessity of bravely defending against these attacks. Free people, aware of their responsibilities and the righteousness of their actions, will, with their inherent strength, and with the aid and guidance of Providence, maintain their stand against this latest attack on their democracy, sovereignty, and freedom.

<h3>Scope of the Defense Area Clearly Includes the Pacific</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 12th. Axis pirate ships, if they do not quickly withdraw from the American defense territorial waters, it seems inevitable that they will encounter hostile actions with the American patrol forces. The meaning of the President's shooting order is that within the defense territorial waters, the American military force will not only protect ships of the United States, but also merchant ships flying any flag. The defense area extends at least to Iceland, which comprises two-thirds of the entire length of the lifeline from ports in the United States and Canada to the British Empire. The exact area of the American defense territorial waters has not been clarified, but the most eventful area is obviously the Atlantic Ocean, while the vast Pacific Ocean, far beyond Hawaii and north to the Siberian coast, is also included. However, President Roosevelt did not mention Japan in his speech. In addition to declaring shoot-on-sight, he insisted on general maritime freedom for commerce, but it seems unlikely that he would maintain this universal global right with gunfire. Willkie said, "No one can say whether the United States will be drawn into war as a result of this, but anyone with a thoughtful mind knows that if the President is not firm, it will inevitably lead to an unfortunate war. Now all Americans should support the President." Landon also said in his speech in Topekaw, "I have not had any illusions for months; if you are looking for trouble, you can always find it." Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas, said, "I hope our destroyers will fire forcefully and directly." Senate Majority Leader Barkley said, "President Roosevelt had no other path to follow." Senator Nye, a prominent isolationist leader and a Republican from North Dakota, declared, "The President's speech has brought us closer to a shooting war because of his declaration." Some who have often criticized the government's policies said that the President's speech is a further attempt to abolish the Neutrality Act. If the public has a good response to the shoot-on-sight order, the President will soon demand the abolition of the Neutrality Act.</p>
<h3>New York Market: Optimistic Outlook</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 11th.

Japanese bonds have greatly improved. The financial community believes that America's tough attitude toward Germany has made a deep impression on Japan and may lead to a resolution of the Far Eastern problem.</p>
<h3>German Forces Approaching Western Suburbs, Situation in Leningrad Critical; German Commander Orders City to be Taken and Money Paid Within Two Days; Another Route Attacks Murmansk; Red Army Counterattacks in the Central and Southern Regions Continue to Make Progress</h3>
<p>International News Agency, London, 12th. The "Exchange Telegraph," which is known for its well-informed sources, reported today from Sweden that Soviet troops have entered the western suburbs of Leningrad and street fighting is underway.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. Although reports here say that the German army is still twenty miles away from Leningrad, it is heard that German Commander General Leeb has ordered the city to be taken within two days. Moscow sources still believe that Leningrad has been completely surrounded, saying that railway traffic to the east is still open. It is reported that the fighting around the city is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Havas, somewhere on the Soviet border, 11th. The German-Soviet War has lasted eighty-two days. The overall situation on the front line is still most tense in the northern route. After the Finnish army linked up with the German army south of Lake Ladoga, Leningrad was surrounded on all sides and transportation was blocked. The German army is now fiercely bombing the city with aircraft and artillery. The Red Army is also stepping up the city's defenses, vowing to hold it to the death. Both sides are evenly matched and at a stalemate. As for the central and southern routes, the Red Army has launched fierce counterattacks against the German army in recent days and has been quite successful. The German army is on guard and dare not relax slightly. In the southern route, although the port of Odessa is under bombardment by the Finnish and Romanian air forces, it is still able to receive reinforcements from the sea. The terrain of the port is more dangerous than that of Leningrad. Although it is besieged on three sides, it can still be defended.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. There is a new development in the Soviet-German war today. According to responsible sources, there are now signs that the German army has begun to attack the Murmansk region in the Arctic Ocean (600 miles north of Leningrad). However, how this attack will progress and its scale are still unknown. It is heard that the German army is invading Murmansk from the west, and the Finnish army is expected to participate as well. Murmansk has a railway line that runs south to Leningrad. Part of this line runs along the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The Finnish side has recently threatened to advance on the east bank of the lake. Further reports are still awaited. However, this new development does not seem to affect the fighting in the main center. The Soviet bulletin at midnight on Thursday did not detail the latest developments. There seem to be no major changes in the Leningrad region. The war situation of the Soviet army's counterattack along the long front line of 200 miles between Smolensk and Gomel is slightly unclear. It is reported that the German army has launched a counterattack southeast of Gomel, but this has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. If it is true, there will be important developments in the next two or three days. Soviet sources report that the Soviet army has continued to make progress and victories at various points in the central region. In one place, the Soviet army under General Yelemenko repelled the German army by twelve miles and recaptured ten villages on Wednesday. The German army suffered this terrible loss, which shows the ferocity of the Soviet army's attack. The German side reported that fierce fighting north of Kyiv was underway on Wednesday. However, Moscow sources said that the Soviet army's invasion there had been contained, and two German infantry divisions had also been heavily damaged. Regarding the war situation in Ukraine, London has not received reliable information. The German army in the area still seems to be trying to cross the Dnieper River. A Soviet supplementary statement said that the Soviet army's resistance to the invading Romanian army in Odessa was quite successful. Therefore, on the whole, there have been no major developments on the Soviet-German front in the past 24 hours except for Murmansk. The Soviet army in Leningrad is resolutely defending as before. It is noteworthy that German propaganda claims that the German people do not expect the city to fall quickly. German radio recently broadcast, "Whether Leningrad falls sooner or later makes no difference to the general strategic situation."</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Takes Personal Command of Military to Avoid Expanding Warfare; Willing to Loosen Ties with Axis to Foster Close Cooperation Between Army Ministry and Cabinet</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 12th. The Japanese Emperor directly managed the army's authority yesterday, it is widely believed that this action is intended to enable the Army Ministry and the Konoe Cabinet to cooperate closely, so that Japan can avoid the scourge of war, even if it loosens ties with the Axis as a result. The general major developments are as follows: (1) A new headquarters was established, headed by General Yamada, the Inspector General of Military Academies. Japan was divided into four army regions, making General Yamada answerable only to the Emperor. People recall that General Yamada had previously served as the principal of the Army University, and had contributed greatly to the "re-education" of radical young officers since the May 15 Incident in 1932. Therefore, this new organization will ensure the closest cooperation between the army and the cabinet. (2) Konoe appointed Goto as the chairman of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. (3) The Emperor invited the cabinet to a luncheon "to express his appreciation for the cabinet's contributions." This action is a great honor for the cabinet and is sufficient to indicate the Emperor's approval of the cabinet's efforts to keep Japan out of war. (4) Newspapers continue to stop attacking the United States, and the China &amp; Foreign Commercial News, which usually reflects the current cabinet's policies, even said that new efforts should be made to adjust US-Japan relations. (5) The General Mobilization Committee approved four orders regarding adjusting labor, conscripting people into the army, supervising workers in key factories, and matters concerning the National Labor Service Corps. At this point, labor has been placed in a virtual state of war. In addition, the Committee approved the confiscation of Japan Electric Power Company, power companies, and many other cases.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th. Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro, the newly appointed chief of staff of the National Defense General Headquarters, gave a speech to reporters at the Army Ministry today, stating that the department will be fully responsible for completing air defense and will fully cooperate with other relevant authorities. He hopes that the people will trust the army's defensive strength and do their best for the completion of the supreme organization of national defense, so that they can smoothly cope with the various difficult situations. The people of the whole country should calmly observe developments, not lightly believe in unfounded rumors, and trust the government and the military.</p>

<h3>"Death Ray" Inventor Passes Away</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cardiff, England, 12th. Mr. Mathus, the inventor of the "death ray," has now passed away. Mr. Mathus studied rayology and invented bactericidal light, designed new air defense plans, and planned to build a rocket plane that could travel six miles per second directly to the moon. For research purposes, he usually lived in a house on a mountain in Wales, 700 feet above sea level, which was heavily guarded. He was a creator of radio and sound movies, invented a device that could detect submarines 30 miles away, and tested light that could stop the engines of aircraft and cars daily. His proposed air defense plans included air mines and rockets carrying paratroopers with several bombs carried by fine silk threads that could reach a height of 30,000 feet in four and a half seconds.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Upward After President Luo's Speech; Actual Sales and Short Covering Occur Simultaneously</h3>
<p>After hovering for two days, the yarn market turned upward yesterday. This was because short sellers, seeing reports that Chairman Jiang had told American reporters that China would not change its national policy, had their confidence shaken. The people who had sold short were greatly affected and had a tendency to cover their positions. At the same time, transactions by the Guangdong merchants became more active, unlike the sluggishness of the previous day. As for the Nanyang region, negotiations are still ongoing. Some said that 500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn were traded last night at a price of 1,740 yuan. Therefore, selling pressure decreased, and the market tightened, causing prices to rise. After President Roosevelt's speech was announced, discussions in the business community suggested that the yarn market could not be viewed pessimistically. However, a large number of short positions had not yet been covered and were still struggling, so the market remained calm, and the upward momentum was still slow. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,762 yuan, and the low price was 1,743 yuan. The market opened enthusiastically in the afternoon because people's confidence stabilized after President Luo's speech. The price was 1,764 yuan, rising to 1,768 yuan. The closing price was 1,762 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of Double Horse yarn was relatively flat, with the opening price at 1,743 yuan. However, due to positive news, buyers flocked in, and the market became tighter, soon rising to 1,762 yuan. At the same time, exchange prices also jumped, and people's confidence increased. However, some profit-takers sold off, causing the price to fall back to 1,752 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the Hong Kong merchants' spot yarn trading was more active, and the exchange price closed higher again. Short covering drove the price up again to 1,762 yuan. According to the statistics, 9,500 bales were traded in half a day. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Merchants 150, Other Merchants 9,500</p>
<p>Total 9,650</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market suddenly became prosperous, suddenly becoming prosperous. The price of American cotton rose first, followed by the factory orders, and most people were excited, especially the retail investors covering their short positions. The buying sentiment permeated the market, leading to a situation of easy rise and little fall. The opening trend in the morning was quite strong. The large dormant players added to and initiated purchases to boost prices in the near term. Therefore, the market was dominated by buyers. The September contract opened at 1,655 yuan, the October contract at 1,666 yuan, and the November contract at 1,682 yuan. The opening price once tended to rise, but the widely publicized speech of President Luo in the middle made people lack a foundation, and the exchange once made a small return, so the period yarn also softened, but then it returned again. The afternoon closed up about 5.5 yuan to more than 10 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment was very strong because the factory orders were firm, and the market price rose section by section. The September contract once rose to 1,668 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,680 yuan, and the November contract also rose to 1,692 yuan, which seemed very stable. Russia's retail investors had some profit-taking, and there was a slight decline. As a result, the September contract was 1,664 yuan, closing up 14.5 yuan, the October contract was 1,676 yuan, up 17.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,690 yuan, up 15.5 yuan. Judging from the trend, it is likely that there is a major reason for the recent pull-up by large players. Therefore, the yarn foot market may be stable and strong for a while if there is no negative international stimulation. However, it is also necessary to beware of the high-level exits of the multi-party. The transaction price list is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: New Stone Pier Longans Have Been Released</h3>

It is said that many goods will arrive in the future, and the market may have to return to looser prices.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Cotton Shipments to Shanghai Blocked: Indian Cotton Becomes Popular Purchase</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading is not smooth. However, after President Roosevelt's speech was published, people's hearts were quiet, and the yarn price has turned up. The situation has become more expensive. As for American cotton, it has progressed upward again, so the industry's thoughts are still leaning towards a good outlook. In addition, cotton from Jiangbei has been blocked from arriving in the future, so people's confidence has turned to foreign cotton, and they are vying to absorb Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 200 bales, 780.0, Yufeng Factory</p>
<p>Omura 300 bales, 330.0, Qinfeng Factory</p>

<p>Some Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng Wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 2,912 bales of cotton from Calcutta, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to sales by the Southern merchants and profit-taking by bulls, but then rebounded due to purchases by New Orleans and Wall Street. At the same time, the purchase intentions were excited because of the threat of storms along the coast and in the Midwest. As a result, the closing prices were about 26 to 23 pounds higher than the previous day, depending on the terms.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to good cotton seed trading, but then fell due to sales by cotton merchants and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, yesterday's closing prices fell by about 2 to 6 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 3.25 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quiet and firm. Although all parties are enthusiastic about purchasing due to the firm footing of American cotton and the high price of spot cotton in this city, actual transactions are few because ships are still difficult to obtain and foreign exchange settlement has not been smooth. Yesterday, in addition to the slightly embellished spot cotton situation, there were only three or four small batches of Brazilian cotton orders.</p>
<h3>Securities: Funds Injected, Bonds and Stocks</h3>
<p>The informal bond market fell once in the morning yesterday, but in the afternoon the buying appetite was strong. Class C bonds rose to as high as two yuan, and the smallest trade was 1.3 yuan. Not only was the one-yuan market unable to be broken, it even returned to as high as one yuan. Although the rebound was not large, it was enough to show the strength of the multi-party. The future is still a situation of easy rise and difficult fall. In the morning yesterday, No. 25 Shengda bought about 300,000 yuan, and Xinfu also came to buy. Sheng Chang Dingkang also absorbed weakly. But the sellers were too crowded, and Hongda Lianhe Yuxing Dazhong Renchang Jiucheng were all selling, so Class C bonds were seen at 1.3 yuan. After entering, they rebounded slightly, similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, Xinfenghao raised the price to buy, and Runde Xinfu Defu Renfeng Xie Kang all had needs. The selling atmosphere on the table decreased, and although Yitai Tongxing Hongda Xinchang Renchang sold, Class C was seen at a high price of two yuan. The market was very firm, and it was difficult to see the size of the market. As a result, except for Class D, which was still down 2 cents, the rest recovered by 9 points to 2.5 cents. 2.34 million yuan were traded. The concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 16.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Public Works Bureau continued to rise strongly. Although many sellers came out, the buying momentum was very strong. Prices were absorbed as soon as they returned slightly, and then the market was raised. As a result, it was difficult to fall, and the half-day turnover exceeded one million shares. The closing potential was extremely strong.</p>
<p>London, November 11 (Thursday) Electric. Today, Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of British companies in the Far East rose more than they fell.

<p>There is a new trend in Shanghai recently, that is, all stocks are rising, and all Chinese stocks are expensive. For example, various Chinese public utility stocks in Shanghai, such as water, electricity, and electricity, are all suspended, and the losses are huge. However, some exceed the face value, and some are also between 60% and 70% of the face value. As for the various stocks in operation, eight or nine out of ten exceed the face value. After the freeze, general funds have turned to securities. The soaring prices of Chinese and foreign stocks, who knows if they are not the work of funds?</p>

<h3>Food: Rice Market Fluctuations Eventually Return to Stability</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice: After another depreciation in Korea, yesterday, due to the excess of the fall, it caused actual sales to take advantage of the cheapness to add to the reserves, and the ball was active, and it suddenly became tight. At the beginning of the morning market, the general sellers were waiting to see the opportunity and were unwilling to easily release their goods, and many shops in this street were quite interested. At the same time, the shorts started to cover their positions, and there were also new hoarders absorbing, and the ball trading started to surge, and the movement was abnormal. Therefore, the sellers took the opportunity to hold up, and the shouts were raised sharply. The prices all the way up. No. 1 West Real High Goods opened to 123 yuan, Bank Station Small Twisted opened to 109 yuan, and Outer Station opened to 108 yuan. Later, because the price was high and the sales were sluggish, it was flattened again. The color of the turnover is now swirling, and after that, the floating households who have made a profit are all coming out again, and the market is turning strong, and it is back to being tired. The rise and fall are repeated, and by the time of the closing, it is tight again. Therefore, the result of the closing market is an increase of 1 or 2 yuan compared with the previous market. A total of 14,000 bags of rice were traded throughout the day, and the British Huasi was 8900 tons. Although rumors have recently seen bearishness, large households are still insisting, but before the situation of peace or war between Japan and the United States is decided, the market price will not be excessively improved. The total rice stored in each station this week is 1,199,754 bags, which is a decrease of more than 44,000 bags compared with last week.</p>
<p>The glutinous japonica rice, early indica rice, and broken glutinous rice and new glutinous rice are all transferred according to the amount of their sources and whether the sales market is smooth or not. Therefore, the result is that early indica rice in South Port is depreciated by 12 yuan due to the abundance of goods, opening at 148 yuan to 145.5 yuan, while Wuxi broken glutinous rice is not glorified because the supply and demand are similar, and the special glutinous rice is still 152 yuan. The Kunshan high glutinous rice is 150 yuan, and the new glutinous rice is rare and insufficient for distribution, and it is exceptionally firm and beautiful, and it is unique to raise 12 yuan, opening at 153 yuan to 151.5 yuan. Although the route of glutinous rice is not wide, there are still some scattered appetites, but the source has been cut off for a long time, and the market goods have been rare. The cargo owner has no intention of releasing the goods easily, so under the sale, the market is standing guard, and there is no change. Hong Kong's special yuan is 127 yuan, ordinary high since 125.5 yuan, and second to 111 yuan, and glutinous green is 1112 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is also coming to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng Wheel carries 10,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and is docked at Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The foreign rice is the Municipal Council's fair-priced rice (Zu).</p>
<h3>Scattered Route of Flour</h3>

In addition to the continued handling by each household on this street, the customers in the inland area also responded slightly. Kanfen Golden Dragon Spleen and American Fen Paotai Brand are recognized as the standard sales in the market due to their good quality and sufficient inventory. Even the general miscellaneous brands have some decimals. A total of 23,000 bags of various powders were traded throughout the day, and the actual sales accounted for the majority. The hoarders did not dare to enter and were reluctant to exit due to the undecided situation of peace or war between Japan and the United States. Both parties then became an abandoned game, and the market was less active. The market began to tend to be flat, but the floating households' ball trading could not be avoided, so the market still fluctuated. The West Warehouse of Jinlong opened in the morning market at 30 yuan, 0.9 yuan, then to 31 yuan, 0.5 points, and then returned to flatness. In the afternoon, it was 30 yuan, 0.89 yuan.

<h3>Oil Market: Rapeseed Oil Foreign Village Asks, the Price Has Returned to 34 Yuan</h3>
<p>The food oil market situation is that Yangzhuang suddenly came to ask for 200 tons of rapeseed oil, and the price was 200 yuan, which made people quite firm and beautiful. Those who threw short saw a reduction in the industry, and the market trend turned to prosperous. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil once soared 67 yuan, and then the profit-takers sold off a little, and the result was that it was still 34 yuan higher than before. The total market opened for the next transaction of 6,000 dunnage of Qing Oil from the Dayou Factory in September, and the opening price was 171 yuan. The highest was 173 yuan, the lowest was 160 yuan, 5 cents, and the closing was 170 yuan, 0.5 yuan. There were also 500 barrels of raw rapeseed oil, priced at 171 yuan to 170 yuan.

<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Revived Uniquely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose first and then softened. The result was more expensive than the previous day, rising from 2 yuan to several cents. However, the Dutch red rose more strongly, while the car red fell back. Chebai's next stall was slightly soft. The public association divided the market, and the spot 24 crude white sugar for August arrival was 134.5 yuan to 35.2 yuan, up 1.6 yuan. July was 134.3 yuan to 35 yuan, up 2 yuan.

<h3>Textiles: Cotton Fabric Trading Resurgence, Sales Prices Also Rise</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Stagnant for several days, yesterday saw a slight increase in activity, due to Chairman Chiang's firm statement, market sentiment changed again, with fellow traders increasing purchases, and dyeing factories also buying grey cloth, resulting in a price increase of 2.5 to 5 dimes per bolt. This street saw over 500 pieces traded including grey cloth, flannel, coarse cloth, twill, etc. The Guangdong-Hong Kong group handled over 100 pieces of Indanthrene blue twill, etc. The Nanyang group handled over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, etc.</p>

Dyeing factories and fellow traders transacted over 600 pieces.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: "Old Knife Brand" Cigarettes Plunge</h3>
<p>Since the cessation of levying "zhan dan" taxes on cigarettes, purchase prices had been rising without end. Yesterday's opening price saw a sharp drop, because the manufacturers announced a new market price schedule and distributed goods to fellow traders for sale, leading to extremely soft market sentiment. Therefore, prices all plummeted by over 200 yuan compared to before. "Old Knife Brand" saw the most severe drop, falling by 600 yuan.</p>

<h3>Power Company Again Requests Surcharge on Coal per "Jin" [Unit of Weight]: Public Utilities Committee Held Meeting Yesterday, What Decisions Were Made Is of Great Concern to All</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM in the Council's conference room to discuss two proposals: (1) a proposal by Baolong Hospital requesting a special discount on electricity used by the hospital from the Shanghai Water &amp; Electricity Company; (2) a proposal by the Shanghai Power Company requesting approval to levy a surcharge on coal per "jin." Regarding the first proposal, Baolong Hospital based its request on the grounds that the hospital is a public service and should therefore have its electricity fees reduced. However, each point made by the hospital could be cited as precedent by all hospitals in the city, so the outcome is of significant interest. As for the second proposal, in addition to the 30% restriction already implemented for large electricity consumers, the company intends to levy a surcharge on coal per "jin" for industrial electricity consumption. The company had previously levied a surcharge on coal per "jin" in 1932 due to a shortage of coal in Shanghai, charging one "cheng" [10%] surcharge per kilowatt-hour, except for industrial electricity consumers. Therefore, whether or not a surcharge on coal per "jin" will be levied this time must be decided after discussion. However, the results of yesterday's meeting are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Measures Revised: Guarantee System Abolished, Those Previously Applying for Foreign Exchange Must Re-submit Applications; Chongqing Economic Circles Encourage Capital Movement Inward</h3>
<p>Havas World News Agency Chongqing, 12th: Economic figures here say that the Stabilization Fund stipulates that those in Shanghai engaged in international trade must sell foreign exchange earned from exports to 14 banks, otherwise they will be refused the foreign exchange needed for imports. This measure is an effective measure to eliminate the remaining black market. After the black market for foreign exchange is eliminated, the inward movement of legal tender can be stimulated by means of premiums. At the same time, the inward movement of goods should be encouraged. The government, it is said, will provide transportation conveniences and insurance coverage for those who move goods. The government can also compensate for losses from premiums. In addition, the Ministry of Finance announced that those with legitimate uses can apply to use foreign currency. Those with deposits frozen in foreign banks who want to transfer them to the Central Bank are bound to increase.</p>
<p>Goods Provided with Foreign Exchange Can Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of Mercantile Bank, told reporters yesterday that the trial measures for September promulgated by the Stabilization Fund were passed by the plenary meeting of the Stabilization Fund. The chairman of the meeting was Mr. Chen Guangfu, the Chinese chairman; Mr. McKay, supervisor of Citibank, and himself were present. The American commissioner, Mr. Fox, was represented by his assistant, Mr. Taylor. After Mr. Tweedy returned to Hong Kong from Manila, he held another meeting with all the commissioners last week. After careful overall study, the final decision was made on the proposed measures. After the Hong Kong meeting concluded, they returned to Shanghai. Since the Stabilization Fund announced the new measures regarding the supply of foreign exchange in Shanghai, stipulating that certain specially approved imported goods can settle foreign exchange at the rate set by the Stabilization Fund of 5.3125 yuan per U.S. dollar, the market price of major imported goods, although there is no downward trend, according to an employee of an American oil company, at least before the consultation between the oil companies and representatives of the Stabilization Fund is over, there will be no change. An importer of pharmaceuticals also said that the price of imported pharmaceuticals will not change. If the measures set by the Stabilization Fund are fully implemented, it can curb the rise in drug prices.</p>
<p>Previously Settled Foreign Exchange Must Re-submit Applications</p>
<p>The Central Bank has received orders from the Stabilization Fund to promulgate revised measures for requesting the supply of foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, and has notified 14 Allied banks and the China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to implement them together. It has also issued the revised application form format to the relevant banks for printing and distribution to the various importing firms with whom they do business, retroactively supplying foreign exchange at the prices set by the Stabilization Fund beginning on September 3. As for those who requested foreign exchange from the designated banks using written or old-style applications before September 3, they must re-fill the revised application forms and complete the various procedures. At the moment, the designated Chinese and foreign banks have sent letters along with single application forms to their respective customers. The revised application form is named "Application to the Stabilization Fund for Foreign Exchange Required." There are two types: white and red. White is used for applying for foreign exchange for goods listed on Lists A and B. Red is used for small-scale trade with a monthly amount not exceeding US$2,000 or £500. Both are in quintuplicate. The first, second, third, and fourth copies are submitted to the Stabilization Fund. The fifth copy is kept by the bank. Each copy must be signed or stamped by the handling bank and the importing firm. Importers who wish to apply for foreign exchange can obtain this type of application form from any designated bank, fill in the relevant items, and submit it to the original handling bank for submission to the Stabilization Fund for approval. The approval period, approval method, and amount, etc., are entirely determined by the Stabilization Fund. The nature of the application form is only similar to an investigation form.</p>
<p>Method of Approving Foreign Exchange Settlement Changed</p>
<p>The tenth item of the application form originally contained a guarantee provision: "If the Stabilization Fund finds that the imported goods described herein do not match those described in the application, our bank is willing to sell all the foreign exchange obtained from the Stabilization Fund for the supply of imported goods back to the Stabilization Fund at the exchange rate at the time of purchase…" However, the revised application form deletes this paragraph. The reason is that, according to the old law, applications could be submitted by telegram before the application form was delivered to the Stabilization Fund, and then the application form would be supplemented later. Therefore, if the Stabilization Fund found discrepancies in the application, it could order the original handling bank to recover the approved foreign exchange. But now, according to the revised measures, the Stabilization Fund will approve foreign exchange settlement only after receiving the application form, deciding whether to approve or disapprove based on the actual situation, or settling all or part. Therefore, the guarantee of "selling back" in the original method can be cancelled.</p>
<h3>French Flagship Moored in Shanghai Ordered to Sail Away</h3>
<p>The French flagship "Grange" moored in Shanghai was recently ordered to leave Shanghai from the pontoon on the Bund in the French Concession and sail to Vietnam. The flagship of the French Far East Fleet, "La Motte-Picquet" (7,249 tons), has been moored off Saigon since leaving Shanghai. According to Japanese sources, the ship will be moved to Osaka Dockyard for repairs soon.</p>
<h3>Following Curbing of Rice Prices, Curbing of Coal Briquette Prices: Municipal Council Cooperates with French Municipal Council; Coal Briquette Factories Still Active After Bombing</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that the municipal authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession are organizing a committee to control the price of coal briquettes. If successful, millions of citizens will benefit greatly. It is not yet known who will serve as members of the committee. A spokesman for the Municipal Council only said, "We are cooperating with the French Municipal Council to establish this committee."</p>
<p>No Authority for Trade Associations</p>
<p>The price of coal briquettes is now twenty times higher than before the war. The Coal Industry Association attempted to lower the price, but ten major coal briquette manufacturers, all members of the association, recently withdrew from the association and set their own high prices. The association therefore has no authority to implement its price limit decision. In recent months, the price of coal briquettes has risen higher and higher, reaching an unprecedented high of 17.2 yuan per "dan" [unit of weight]. After the municipal authorities of the two concessions achieved excellent results by purchasing foreign rice on their own to deal with the food problem for citizens, they have now decided to establish a new committee to study the problem of coal briquettes, an essential fuel for citizens, and find a way to solve it.</p>
<p>Suppression Measures</p>
<p>According to coal briquette manufacturers, 17.2 yuan per "dan" is a fair selling price that only obtains legitimate profit. The high price is due to the increased cost of importing coal dust from Vietnam and India. Observers believe that the municipal authorities must handle the import of coal dust themselves and resolutely implement other stringent measures in order to suppress the price of coal briquettes. What actions the municipal authorities will take will naturally depend on the recommendations of the new committee. The seriousness of the coal briquette problem can be seen in the recent bombing of two coal briquette factories, which injured three people. The bombers aimed to reduce the price of coal briquettes. The newly established committee also has this as its goal, but will proceed in a more effective and legal way.</p>
<h3>Unified Check Clearing: Implemented the Day After Tomorrow, Scheduled Clearing Suspended</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banks Joint Reserve Committee, referring to the regular clearing system of the London Check Clearing House, has decided to change all cleared checks to be settled by collection method, and has established a unified check clearing system. It is scheduled to be implemented starting September 15 (Monday). The original scheduled clearing will be suspended. After this, the clearing banks will be spared the trouble of dispatching staff to the clearing house every day, the procedures will be unified, and the work can be simplified. The detailed measures have already been seen in this newspaper's economic news column.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest on Gold Long-Term Bonds Can Be Collected on Behalf in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The 16th repayment of principal on the long-term gold finance bonds of the Republic of China has been drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on [Date in month unclear]. All drawn bonds and matured interest can be paid starting September 30. A reporter from the "New Voice News" learned yesterday from the Central Bank that the principal to be repaid for this gold long-term issue is 1,125,000 yuan, and the matured interest is 351,561.25 yuan. Although the collateral for these bonds is the customs surplus, in order to maintain credit, funds have been allocated and deposited with the bank, and will be paid in full starting at the end of September. However, payments will be made at the Chongqing head offices of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. However, the Shanghai branch offices of these three banks can collect on behalf.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Consumption of Cosmetics</h3>
<p>According to information from the Jianghai Customs, from January to July of this year, imports of perfumes and cosmetics were valued at 539,174 Haikwan taels of gold, equivalent to 1,459,544 yuan in national currency. From January to July of last year, the figure was only 329,035 Haikwan taels of gold, equivalent to 890,699 yuan in national currency. Therefore, this year's imports exceeded the same period last year by as much as 550,000 yuan in national currency. At a time when the nation is struggling, such unnecessary consumption of cosmetics has intensified, and we must be vigilant.</p>

The investigator then asked whether he wished the police department to assign a lawyer to defend him, and the defendant nodded, as if he had lost the power to speak.

<h3>Rice Inventory</h3>
<p>In order to make the outside world aware of the amount of rice stored, the Shanghai Rice Industry Association sends personnel every week to Pudong, Hongkou, the central district and other places to conduct on-site surveys of rice inventory. According to the association's survey of 128 rice stockpiles (from last Thursday to this Friday), a total of more than 80 Chinese and foreign stockpiles held 1,199,754 bags of rice, a slight decrease from the previous period. The reason is that the number of ships coming to Shanghai from overseas last week was not as high as the previous week. A large amount of foreign rice that has already been traded is waiting to be loaded onto ships in the production areas. The Rice Industry Association has submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions for review and to seven rice industry groups for price preparation.</p>

<h3>Foreign Vessels Sailing Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian Line: Clearance Not Approved, Da Shun Kang Vessel Detained at Wusongkou, Harrison President Ship May Arrive Today</h3>
<p>Foreign merchant ships that previously sailed along the ports of the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, in view of the recovery of Fuzhou, and in order to dredge the source of funds, are preparing to resume Shanghai-Fujian shipping, and have requested the consular authorities and the Jianghai Customs to allow the resumption of sailing. It is reported that most of these ships belong to British merchants, and there are also American merchants. The British and American Consulates in Shanghai have no problem with the resumption of sailing of the ships, but the Jianghai Customs has consistently refused to allow the ships to clear customs for export. The shipping companies have requested the consular authorities to contact the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>Da Shun Kang Vessel: Export Detained</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, a foreign firm here, in order to facilitate passengers traveling from Shanghai to the interior, chartered the Da Shun Kang vessel of Jardine Matheson from a French shipping company, intending to sail directly from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay. This would allow passengers to avoid having to go through Hong Kong, avoiding the trouble of preparing entry permits, etc. Therefore, at that time, the ship was very crowded. On the 3rd of this month, after being approved by the Jianghai Customs for clearance, it hoisted the French flag and left Shanghai, intending to sail directly to Guangzhou Bay that day. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to Wusongkou, it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy, preventing it from exporting. As of yesterday, nine days had passed, and it had not been released. It is reported that the Japanese Navy's reason for detaining the ship is that it was not registered and that the exported goods must be inspected. Therefore, the passengers on the ship are trapped on board, which is extremely painful.</p>
<p>Harrison Ship: May Arrive Today</p>
<p>The American President Lines is scheduled to send two President ships to Shanghai this month. In addition to the Pacific Bunker Hill, which left port the day before yesterday, another ship is the world-class Harrison President liner, which returned to the United States on the 15th of last month via the Cape of Good Hope. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the ship will arrive in port this morning and will be in Shanghai for about one or two days, still following the original world-class route and returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. According to the company's scheduled President ship schedule, the next President ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in early October.</p>
<p>President Ship Plans: Full Resumption of Flights</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, who inquired in the shipping industry, the American President Lines vessels requisitioned by the US Maritime Commission on June 16 of this year included Coolidge, Cleveland, Pierce, Taft, Hayes, Jackson, and Adam, a total of seven ships. Currently, the Cleveland and Coolidge ships have already resumed flights to Shanghai one after another. It is now learned that the President Pierce ship has also been scheduled to resume flights and arrive here on the 30th of this month. However, it is learned that the ship will not be used exclusively for evacuating overseas Chinese and has all levels of cabin class available for passengers to take.

<h3>Japanese Rubber Factory: Steam Boiler Explosion, Three Workers Injured</h3>
<p>At the Minwah Rubber Factory, No. 124 Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, a steam boiler suddenly exploded yesterday afternoon, injuring workers. Yesterday afternoon at 11:45 AM, the steam boiler in the factory's machine room suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. At that time, there was a loud bang, and the iron sheets flew in all directions, and boiling water splashed everywhere. Most of the laborers did not know what was happening and fled, causing great chaos. As a result, three laborers in the machine room were hit and scalded by iron sheets and boiling water: Tang Changgen (19 years old) injured arm, feet, and head; Wu Xingtao (19 years old) injured head and face, etc.; Xu Caibao (23 years old) injured head and chest, etc. They were sent to Hudong Hospital for treatment after the accident.

<h3>Tongren Fu Yuan Hall Information</h3>
<p>The Tongren Fu Yuan Branch Hall on Ningbi Road in the French Concession specializes in the management of the burials and funerals of homeless bodies of all sizes and the abandonment of coffins of all sizes within the French Concession. All expenses were previously covered by real estate income. Since the war, most of the property has been destroyed in the occupied areas, resulting in no income, and expenses are very tight. Moreover, recent donation income is very small, which is not enough to support the charity. A team was dispatched to Nanyang Hong Kong to raise funds a month ago, and it is now preparing to raise funds in this city. All procedures are currently underway, and once everything is ready, a team will be sent out to solicit donations to maintain the charity.</p>
<h3>Memorial Article for Wang Dan Kui</h3>
<p>— Dai Chunfeng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Dan Kui of Chongming was elegant and valued moral philosophy, he embraced his sorrow in these times. Both in and out of office, he put what he had learned into practice. In his later years, he devoted himself to water conservancy, bringing fortune to the southeast. His reputation was well-deserved, a mirror for all to admire. He suddenly passed away a month ago, and those who knew him and those who did not were deeply saddened. A memorial service is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM new clock time on September 14th in the auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Association. This newspaper previously published a biography of Mr. Wang Dan Kui written by Tang Weizhi. Now we have obtained a memorial article written by Dai Chunfeng, as follows:</p>
<p>On this fourteenth day of September in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, Dai Chunfeng of Funing, with a bundle of fresh grass and a cup of clear tea, reverently offers this sacrifice to the spirit of Wang Dan Kui: Alas, the black dragon hides its brilliance, the white crane conceals its splendor, the energy is stifled in the azure clouds, Su Nei Han's life palace sits in Scorpio, the literary talent is buried in the yellow earth, Deng Gaomi's unlucky fate meets the snake. It is as if a sword hides its light and a jade its talisman. Is there anyone like Mr. Wang Dan Kui? When young, he was outstanding, not boasting of his knowledge of rats or the stele of chickens; when older, he was intelligent, compared to the tiger's head and the swallow's jaw. He excelled in scholarship and served as an official, taking up his duties in the government, quoting the classics, combining leniency and severity, resolving disputes and difficulties for the inhabitants. He used the classics to govern the country, and people were amazed at the young woman's yellow silk; he expressed concern for the people, and lamented the flaw in the precious vase. His writing was worthy of appreciation, his wisdom worthy of admiration. Was it not because he was both a scholar and a man of integrity and piety that he could achieve this? When the chaos of war directly attacked the imperial capital and the imperial family fled west, he avoided the chaos and relied on his mother's home, moving east with her in a sedan chair, comparable to the filial piety of Ying Kao Shu. Filial piety reached its extreme. Fortunately, Zheng Zhuang Gong could be influenced by sincerity, and his contributions were not insignificant. When the world turned around, the rain cleared, and the rainbow disappeared, he did not covet his position and abandoned his official status. In the long wind, he traveled ten thousand miles, visiting foreign lands, and returned from the ocean, further refining his judgement. Although his talent for economics was thwarted, he returned and established a department to do business, wholeheartedly serving the country. No ancient virtuous man could surpass him, and no contemporary celebrity could compare to him. Moreover, he welcomed talents with open arms, always ready to receive them. We had hoped that he would hold the plan firmly in his grasp and greatly develop it, but how could we have expected that he would leave so soon, before the seat had even warmed? It is a pity that such an unparalleled national talent only had an inexhaustible filial piety. Heaven does not bless those who are virtuous, and this is also Mr. Wang's unique quality. Later, his financial management eliminated corruption and brought clarity, his road construction was solid and used real materials, he promoted water conservancy to benefit the people, and gathered emergency relief to aid the common people. These were the greatest of Mr. Wang's contributions, and the most outstanding of his great achievements. Such virtue and achievements deserved a long life. Even entering the immortal land of the Tongbai Mountains or enjoying the eternal scenery of the mulberry tree in the evening was not an exaggeration. Alas, the fish had nowhere to rely because the trenches were filled in, and the returning swallow lost its home because the Wu Palace burned. This has caused later generations to have no chance to see him again, and the party-state and the homeland can only remember his model. Chunfeng is different in learning and cherishes the flood dragon, ashamed of the talent of the crow in the dream. Remembering his life, everything is vividly in front of my eyes. Recalling Mr. Wang's upright conduct and his words becoming a model, I cannot help but grieve and weep, and present these words with tears. Alas, may you enjoy this offering.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Road: Car Robbery</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily Publishes Declaration: Local Organizations Deny It</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily recently published a declaration in the name of various Shanghai public organizations. It is reported that various local organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the Student Union, and the Municipal Women's Association, have stated that they were never consulted beforehand. Therefore, the so-called "various public organizations" in the declaration are clearly fabricated by borrowing names. They have jointly sent a letter to the newspaper to request a solemn correction.</p>

<h3>Bloody Incident on Avenue Edward VII: She Jinbo Assassinated; Friend Wu Liuting Wounded in the Arm</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a sudden assassination occurred at the entrance of Lane 275 on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. It was later learned that the victim was She Jinbo, and another person, Wu Liuting, was wounded. The gunman escaped without a trace. The details of the incident are described below:</p>
<p>Shot While Getting into a Car with a Friend</p>
<p>She Jinbo, a native of Shaoxing, was 60 years old and resided at No. 20, Lane 275, Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. He lived a comfortable life and had his own car with license plate No. 8531. Yesterday afternoon at 3:50 PM, his friend Wu Liuting, also from Shaoxing, came to visit. After a brief conversation, they went out together. She's driver, Zhu Hongchang, had already parked the car at the entrance of the lane. As She and Wu stepped out of the lane and were about to get into the car, an assassin, who had been lying in wait at the entrance, was ready.</p>
<p>She Hit by Three Bullets, Wu Wounded in Right Arm</p>
<p>As the assassin saw She about to get into the car and the driver opening the door, he immediately pulled out a pistol and fired six or seven shots at She. She was caught off guard and was hit in the head and chest, collapsing in a pool of blood. At the same time, Wu Liuting, who was nearby, was also hit in the right arm by a bullet, causing blood to flow. The assassin, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled with his weapon and disappeared instantly. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a thorough search, but they found nothing. They then took the injured to the hospital. However, She's injuries were fatal, and he died before reaching the hospital. Wu's injuries were not serious.</p>
<p>Cause of Assassination Under Investigation</p>
<p>It is reported that She and Wu were colleagues. The reason for the assassination is currently under investigation by the police. In addition to taking the recovered shell casings back to the police station for examination, the police also summoned Zhu Hongchang, the driver who witnessed the incident, and She's family to the police station to inquire about the details. She's body was transferred to the coroner's office, and the court was requested to conduct an examination.</p>

<h3>Lost and Found</h3>
<p>Jintai Check: A reader found a Jintai check on the tenth while traveling on Xinwen River in the French Concession.

<p>Women's Wallet: Respectfully, yesterday (the 11th), I was riding the No. 24 trolleybus to Avenue Foch. A lady was about to get off when she suddenly lost her wallet. She said that it contained a school pass and keys. She searched everywhere but could not find it and got off at Rue Poussin in disappointment. Later, I saw an object under the door panel of the car and picked it up. It turned out to be a red beaded women's wallet. I handed it over to the ticket seller. When the car arrived at the Canidrome, I got off in a hurry and did not inquire about its number in detail. Therefore, I hereby borrow a corner of your publication to disclose it so that the owner can go to the tram company in the French Concession to claim it. Reader asks.</p>

<h3>On the Sands of Time</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>The magician's best trick is to "create something out of nothing" or "make something disappear without a trace." The audience knows it's fake, but because the magician's movements are so swift, they have to believe it's real. But regardless of whether it's real or fake, the things the magician transforms have already happened in front of the audience to entertain the guests.</p>
<p>If you are buried in worldly affairs, you may not think about the fleeting nature of life. But if you visit an obstetrics hospital and then take a stroll in a cemetery, you can understand how humans line up to come into the world and how they line up to leave the world. The traces of humanity are like the things in the magician's hands, seeming almost impossible to trace. But we are also like the things in the magician's hands, and although we are in the world for a short time, we must and will have an effect in the time and space we occupy. As for what kind of effect we want to have, that is up to each of us to work hard and decide.</p>
<p>The American poet Longfellow had a poem that can be translated as follows:</p>
<p>The deeds of great men tell us,</p>
<p>We too can make our lives sublime,</p>
<p>When we leave this world,</p>
<p>Leave footprints on the sands of time.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the great journey of life,</p>
<p>There is a lonely brother in distress,</p>
<p>Seeing these deep footprints,</p>
<p>Will once again muster the courage to live.</p>
<p>So let us rise up and work hard,</p>
<p>Fear no fate or hardship,</p>
<p>Constantly pursue, constantly create,</p>
<p>Learn how to labor, how to hope.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Family Education</h3>
<p>— Shan Li</p>
<p>The importance of family education on a person is self-evident. But to be honest, in China, we are too casual about family education. In the best cases, parents cooperate and manage together, but often the father plays the stern role, and the mother plays the kind role, scaring on one hand and persuading on the other, hitting on one hand and begging on the other, the so-called strict father and kind mother. At worst, the father is busy doing business outside, and the mother is busy managing household affairs, so you don't care, and I don't bother, putting the responsibility of educating children entirely on the school, and not hearing or asking about it themselves. In the worst cases, the father is not a father, the mother is not a mother, the son is not a son, and the daughter is not a daughter. If they have money, they send their children to school, and if they don't have money, they just give up. If the children are happy, they study, and if they are not happy, they just do as they please. If the father is happy today, he buys a piece of candy for the children to eat, and if he is not happy, he picks them up and beats them. If the mother is happy today, she cooks a good dish for the children to eat, and if she is not happy, she will scold them all day long. Other evil and despicable things are also done by parents in front of their children.</p>
<p>The above three types are all bad family education, differing only in the degree of their severity. Under this kind of bad family education, it is of course very difficult to produce a virtuous and capable child. But once the children grow up and are unfilial, incompetent, and incapable, the parents complain and blame others, thinking that their ancestors lacked virtue, so they produced such unfilial descendants. In fact, if the children are good, the parents can be proud of themselves. If the children are not good, the parents cannot shirk their responsibility. And if parents want their children to be good or not, they should first see if their own education is good or not. As for school education, that is secondary.</p>
<p>Writing this, I remembered an incident related to family education, so I will record it as a conclusion:</p>
<p>"Lily wants to buy lilies!"</p>
<p>"Mom! Someone outside is selling lilies, let's buy some to make lily soup, okay?" A-Da, who was writing, suddenly said.</p>
<p>"Okay!" The mother had just finished speaking when her two sons hurriedly pulled her straight out of the door.</p>
<p>When buying lilies, the mother added a little, grabbed a little, weighed a little more, and argued for a long time with the vendor. And the two sons, of course, had their own work: as long as the lily seller's eyes wandered or her body turned, A-Da took two, and A-Er took one, and their hands and feet were quick, and they had already slipped into the house. After a while, the mother bought the lilies and came back, saw A-Da holding two lilies in his hand and A-Er holding one, and just slowly walked over and put the three lilies into the basket, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Two hours later, the lily soup was cooked.</p>
<p>"Mom! Brother eats three bowls, I want to eat three bowls too," A-Er said dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"Brother eats one more bowl because he took one more lily than you."</p>
<p>The mother's reply made A-Da smile triumphantly.</p>
<p>"I will take more next time," A-Er said angrily.</p>
<p>Thought</p>
<h3>Philosopher</h3>
<p>— Hou Fang</p>
<p>I once heard a story:</p>
<p>A philosopher was traveling on a boat once. On the boat, he gathered with people to chat.</p>
<p>"Sir, do you understand art?" the philosopher asked.</p>
<p>"No," the person replied.</p>
<p>"Then one-third of your life is gone. Also, may I ask, do you understand science?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand either."</p>
<p>"Then another third of your life is gone."</p>
<p>As he was saying this, suddenly everyone shouted that the ship was sinking. The person asked the philosopher calmly,</p>
<p>"Sir, can you swim?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then your whole life is gone."</p>
<p>It is a sad thing when theory is separated from practice and knowledge is separated from reality. The sinking of the ship was unfortunate for the philosopher. He had not learned to swim. He did not have time to learn to swim. He is now going to drown. However, I don't know if that philosopher was unlucky. If he remained calm and prepared to grab a wooden plank to escape, then he would be a true philosopher.</p>
<p>In fact, the experiences of learned people are often so sad. They are too far removed from reality. They do not receive the sympathy of society and are persecuted by society. However, I hope they will always struggle. "There is no resentment in building a home in a place where one is bound to fall."</p>
<p>Military Equipment</p>
<h3>Torpedo Gun</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Many Americans no longer dare to indulge in the delusion of resting easy in this turbulent world. Although there are still some isolationist ostriches who want to deceive themselves and others with the strategy of burying their heads in the sand, most Americans are clear-headed. They know that they cannot "live in isolation" in this small world, so they not only do their best to help the democratic countries resisting aggression, but also make unremitting efforts in the defense of their east and west coasts. Among the recent inventions for coastal defense, there is a torpedo gun made of a steel frame that can be installed on ordinary small speedboats and can launch small torpedoes. It has been suggested that in the event of war in the future, all private yachts in the United States can be equipped with this new weapon to serve the country.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12. Unexpected Disturbance</p>
<p>Principal Fang told him that Xiaogouzi had searched in the city for more than half a month but still couldn't find Mei Bao, so he had no choice but to go to see Liu Tuzi again. But he was very clever. He knew that even if the Public Security Bureau summoned him, they wouldn't be able to get any information out of him, so he decided not to stand firm with him anymore and just begged him softly. He didn't know what he said, but he moved Liu Tuzi, who was rough but not cunning, and he honestly said that he really had no part in this matter, but according to what he knew, the person had been tricked away by Shang Laoer and was now being taken to Beiping. Finally, he gave Xiaogouzi a not very detailed address, so Xiaogouzi had rushed to Beiping overnight. Principal Fang himself helped him with ten yuan for travel expenses. …</p>
<p>"Okay, Third Master, there's finally news about the girl!" Zhang Laoliu, Xiaogouzi's brother, heard about this and hurried to comfort Qiuhaitang again. "With my brother's stubbornness, he won't come back without finding her. You should just relax and take good care of yourself and wait for them to come back!"</p>
<p>Because of Xiaogouzi's loyalty, Qiuhaitang's heart suddenly became more optimistic.</p>
<p>"Your brother is really good. I hope he can bring Mei Bao back. From now on, I will always treat him like a brother!" He said with a rare smile on his face.</p>
<p>From then on, he was indeed a little more relieved and just counted the days, calculating Xiaogouzi's journey every day. (210)</p>

<h3>From "The Swallow Letter" to Kunqu Teacher Zhen Fengming</h3>
<p>— Shi Yiren</p>
<p>"The Swallow Letter" is a famous romance. Only four scenes remain in circulation today: 1. Writing a Portrait, 2. Picking Up the Letter, 3. Adultery and Escape (the dog hole performed by Wang Chuansong, seen in the Li Xiangjun film), and 4. Appealing to the Governor, all of which are male and female lead scenes. Only those who are elegant and sentimental can achieve the highest level. Recently, the Beijing-Chaopai school has also arranged to perform this drama. Wang Guiqiu once announced the repertoire when he came to Shanghai, but it was never actually performed. Only the Yue Opera has been performed several times, which has won the praise of the audience. The original book was written by Ruan Dacheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty. He asked Wang Duo to write lyrics on stationery and presented it to Emperor Hongguang, who was very pleased. He also ordered his family actors to perform it, and all the officials, scholars, and famous people in Nanjing praised it. Wang Yuyang's poem: "New songs and fine characters written on ice silk, the young emperor watched with a smile; for thousands of years, the Qinhuai River has sobbed, and should not still hate Duke Kong." The struggle between the Donglin Society and the Fushe gradually led to the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan" is a true record of the event.</p>
<p>Chen Fengming was a fan actor, skilled in plays such as "Qin Tiao," "Ting Hui," "Shu Zhuang," and "Gui Chi." He and Lu Shouqing, Shi Guilin, Shen Pansheng, and You Caiyun were all top actors of the Suzhou school. His pronunciation was extremely accurate, and his demeanor on stage, the gestures of his fingers, and the fluttering of his sleeves all followed a certain standard without any deviation. When performing "Picking Up the Letter," when Huo Duliang looked up and saw the Yan Qian returning with the wind, his eyes were slanted, and the scene was lifelike. After the age of fifty, he grew a beard and realized the truth, retiring from the stage. He accepted the invitation of the Shanghai Pingsheng Qushe and discussed with amateur actors. Now, Ge Qifu's "Ting Hui," Zhuang Yifu's "Drunken Concubine," and Shen Hengyi and Zhu Yaowen's "Seeing the Mother" all benefited from his guidance. After the age of sixty, he also taught students. Haining Shen Sanming obtained his true biography, played the flute very skillfully, and his rules and schools were the same as his teacher's. He was Fengming's proud disciple. In his later years, he stayed at home and was displaced and impoverished after the incident, and died in a haggard state.</p>
<h3>Record of Famous Amateur Yan Jusheng</h3>
<p>The famous amateur Mr. Yan Jusheng has a deep understanding of the national opera. He sings in the Tan school style, and his "Empty City Stratagem," "Zhuli Lianzhai," and "Arresting and Releasing Cao" all have unique features. Mr. Yan has studied with Wu Baokui for many years, who was the teacher of the famous actor Guan Dayuan.</p>

<h3>The Story of Yu Zhenfei Going to Sea (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shao Xian (Sent from Beiping)</p>
<p>Again, Quan Chu thought that Yun Yuhua and the two would be able to compete with Yanqiu, but who would have thought that Yanqiu is still Yanqiu today, and neither Yun Yuhua nor both were able to cooperate with Cha Quan to the end (but the pianist Mu Tiefen, since leaving Yanqiu, has always played the piano for Yun). As for Quan, his reputation was ruined, to the point of being irreparable. (This person has many wonderful things, which will be described in another article.) Speaking of Yanqiu, after Wang Youquan defected, he invited Jiang Miaoxiang to cooperate. Miaoxiang is a capable person in this field, and cooperating with Yanqiu can be a happy and fulfilling experience. However, Miaoxiang is Meilanfang's supporting role, and he goes out to perform with Lanfang from time to time, and he was unable to cooperate with Yanqiu for a long time. Yanqiu, in view of this, decided to find other talents. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Yanqiu cordially invited Yu Zhenfei to the sea to cooperate. At that time, Zhenfei was playing at sea, and he had no intention of going to the sea. He asked all parties to urge him, and Yanqiu was very respectful to Zhenfei and was willing to treat him generously. Zhenfei finally moved him, only changing the method of the three chapters: (1) Every time Zhenfei performs a play, no matter how many plays are performed, he will be paid for eight plays a month. (2) Everything about Zhenfei must be better than others; (3) Zhenfei has the right to express his opinions at any time if he is dissatisfied. That year, the two parties cooperated under such an agreement, and Zhenfei officially went to sea at this time and performed on the same stage with Yanqiu in Ping. Yanqiu indeed treated Zhenfei with special attention, and Zhenfei also had a sense of knowing Yanqiu. Yanqiu learned a lot from Zhenfei's Kunqu opera skills, and at the same time, because Zhenfei was proficient in writing, Zhenfei also took charge of propaganda and writing when Yanqiu went out to perform. Therefore, the feelings between the two parties are very strong, but who would have thought that the good times would not last long, and they would eventually break up. What caused the breakup? Please read the following article to find out.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Liangxi painter Chen Fucang devoted himself to the six methods of painting. Before the war, he lived in seclusion in Huilu and Jichang Garden. During the incident, the garden was completely destroyed, so he came to Shanghai. He has served as a professor at art schools. The landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals he has created all follow the methods of the ancients and come from his own mind. Now, with the encouragement of friends, he has asked him to present his recent works to the public. An exhibition will be held at the Daxin Painting Hall for eight days starting September 11th. Those who love Chinese painting should be quick to see it first.</p>
<h3>Biographical Sketches of Liyuan Figures</h3>
<p>— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Drawings by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(39) Gao Shengling</p>
<p>Gao Shengling is the son of Qingkui. When Qingkui was at his peak, Shengling borrowed his father's promotion and did not show any special talent. When Qingkui's voice declined, he began to work hard and diligently in order to support the family. Xiaolou devoted himself to his work, and before long, he stood out among his peers and showed his talent. However, Xiaolou passed away suddenly, and he did not have time to guide him to the hall. Shengling's learning of Xiaolou follows the rules and regulations, and he is quite disciplined. Moreover, his voice is clear and bright, and it is vaguely similar. Although Xiaolou's exquisite and profound creations are like a journey of thousands of miles, which cannot be reached by a junior's hard work, Shengling still retains one or two tenths of his style, which is already rare and can be called a talent among the mediocre. However, Shengling has recently been showing signs of laziness on stage, as if he thinks that Xiaolou has always been known for his laziness, so he deliberately imitates it. Xiaolou occasionally made mistakes due to relaxation in middle age, but he reversed this flaw in his later years. His strength was sometimes insufficient, but he did not deliberately act in this way to show off. Now that Shengling has not been able to fully prepare all of Xiaolou's beauty, only "laziness is the key", it is no less than sealing his steps and stopping where he should not stop, which is a pity for such a promising talent!</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Great Shanghai on the 24th</h3>

<h3>Blood Rain on Fine Jade</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage Early with a Delicate Bird</p>
<p>Seeing that the sky had already darkened, bright lanterns were lit everywhere in the residence, and a servant came in to report the arrival of General Wu. Tian Hongyu hurriedly opened the main gate to greet him. He saw Wu Sangui in military uniform, accompanied by four guards, exuding an air of inviolability, which startled him inwardly. He respectfully ushered him into the Siwei Hall, and after the host and guest were seated, they exchanged a few polite remarks. Wu Sangui, seeing that there were no female musicians, deliberately said, "I am calling this evening to thank the Father-in-Law for his hospitality, but in military attire, I cannot stay long and must take my leave." Tian Hongyu said, "It is rare for the General to come here, gracing my humble abode with his presence. I was hoping to have a drink and a chat, to pour out my heart. Why are you in such a hurry to leave? I hope the General will stay for a while since he has come." Wu Sangui nodded slightly. Tian Hongyu then led Wu Sangui to the Hongqing Pavilion to take his seat. The pavilion was brightly lit with candles, and the walls were magnificent, resembling a small palace. A lavish feast was laid out in the center. Tian Hongyu invited Wu Sangui to take the seat of honor. Wu Sangui politely declined once before sitting at the head of the guest seat, looking around, truly impressed by the magnificence. Tian Hongyu usually had such comforts, which was not easy, but unfortunately, the world was in chaos, the capital was uneasy, and he feared that this kind of enjoyment might not last long. After Tian Hongyu poured the wine, he ordered the female musicians to come and serve. In a moment, the sound of jade pendants jingled, and clothes rustled. A group of female musicians slowly walked in, a fragrant breeze filling the air, assailing the nostrils. As Wu Sangui looked up, he saw two young girls with hanging hair carrying two crimson gauze lanterns in front, followed by a score of concubines, all of them beautiful with jade-like faces, bright eyes, and white teeth, wearing embroidered robes and silken gowns, with cloud-like hair and jade-green hairpins, holding various silk and bamboo musical instruments in their hands, truly a rare sight. They entered the pavilion, greeted Tian Hongyu and Wu Sangui with a curtsy, and moved to sit on the side, like famous blossoms blooming in a land of fragrance. Tian Hongyu then turned around and instructed them to first play a piece of "Qing Ping Yue." Once the silk and bamboo instruments were tuned, all the sounds joined together, flowing and melodious, pleasant to hear. After "Qing Ping Yue" was played, they played a song of "Ni Chang Xian Zi," which truly stirred the soul. (169)</p>
