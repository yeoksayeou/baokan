<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統咋日廣播演詞（全文見另電）、雖未披露美國新政策或其現行政策中之新步驟、但此間贊成參戰者頗歡迎美總統決不議和之切實聲明、而總統所表渠不向希特勒乞取勝利者唾餘與納粹戰爭機構、因蘇聯反抗現漸進行遲滯、此時美國應加倍努力、及美國如欲繼續享受其現有之權利、則非擊敗德國不可等意、皆爲聞者所滿意、惟有人以總統未用更明白詞句陳說將來趨向爲憾、衆認此番演詞、旨在使美人準備放棄其所有之許多利益、以便增多戰具之出產、總統所稱美國戰兵現逐日運往各戰塲一語、乃美國援華與援蘇的政策迄無變更、及華盛頓不欲對日綏靖之表示、故甚受人歡迎、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統於勞動節日之演說中、未特別提及日本、昨日衆認爲係留作調解遠東局勢之餘地、同時消息靈通人士指稱、羅總統重新警告謂、與侵略者無法調恊、係暗示興日本之任何交涉中、將續採強硬之立塲、此項警告衆認係對中國及蘇聯重新保證彼等在世界之抵抗侵略者之陣綫中之地位、於美日懸案一旦得和平之解決時、必不遭受危害、羅斯福總統呼額全國增加軍火生產、並對戰爭原料之未全輸送予以更大之保證、衆認爲此乃對日木之警告、即美國將賡續援助中國英國及蘇聯云、</p>
<p>路透社二日紐的電　此間各報皆稱、羅期福總統勞動節之演說爲擊敗希特勒之呼聲、在美印象之深刻、遠過大西洋會議後羅總統所發之仟何言論、「紐的日報」稱之爲個人對希特勒之立戰、「紐約時報」謂吾人目前雖未宣戰或直接參加眞正之戰爭、但吾人已採取之地位必將迫使吾人於現時政策證明不足以擊敗希特勒之時、終於採取此項直接之參加、大多數美人皆不願由此地退縮云、若干評論家認爲演　中未提及日本、可表示解決之門仍行開放、</p>
<h3>羅斯福演詞全文</h3>
<p>海透社二日紐約電　美國勞動節羅斯福總統之演詞、並未切實闡明一切、亦未作美國應再參戰之言論、惟較前此之公開演詞更進一步、而保證美國必出其全力以征服希特勒主義耳、其演詞原文如下、</p>
<p>決心維護民治　爭取自由權利</p>
<p>今日爲美國節期、吾人慶祝目由男女勞動者之權利、此種權利之保持目前至關軍要、不獨在享此權利之吾人爲然、即在基督文明之整個前途亦復如是、美國勞慟現負有在此最野蠻最可怖的戰爭中博取勝利之鉅大責任，吾人各工廠各工塲現皆以大規模製造大量戰具、此種戰具現　夜由海上與天空運往世界各戰塲、而美國刻正計畫並發展具有空前力量之新利器、以期維持民治主義、吾人何爲出此乎、吾人何爲下大決心、以吾人整個工業努力、專用以進行並未觸及吾人疆土之戰爭乎、吾人並非士國之光榮、吾人不感侵略之興趣、吾人不似獨裁者之注意刦掠、吾人不垂涎任何他國之一寸土地、吾人之作此大努力及旨趣一致者、實因吾人承認吾人基本權利—連勞動權利在內—己爲希特勒統治世界之強暴希圖所威脅也、英國海軍與荷蘭挪威美聯之艦隊長此存在、美國海軍定能共同保障海上自由、彼謀使美國目由崩裂之敵國早已知此、並知其他各國海軍如被摧毀、則美國海軍目前或將來決不能維持海上自由、以與勢力遍及世界其他各國之敵國相抗、</p>
<p>促速增加生產　摧毀納粹主義</p>
<p>敵方更知美國出產去年已有長足進步、而其出品現運往反希特勒主義之各戰塲者逐日增多、但敵方亦知美國努力尚未充足、苟吾人不急起直追、增多吾人出產、並以更大規模保護吾人出品安達前敵、則敵人定放胆在新舊各戰塲推進其攻擊、凡以爲希特勒巳被堵截而停頓者、余予以莊嚴警告日、此乃甚危險之臆說、凡敵人進行視一年前爲緩之日、即應以加倍力量予以打擊之時、庶一勞永逸銷滅征服世界之危害、而剷除在對惡安洽上成立和平之言論與思想、吾人皆知自由勞動制度乃活的民治主義之基礎、吾人亦知軸心獨裁者首先行動之一、在掃蕩勞動所已成立以謀其本身維持與進步之各種原則與標準、是以工團主義爲獨裁者所不容許、以工團主義要求發表意見與和平集會之完全自由也、工團主義已助各國勞動家獲有其所應得之尊榮地位、美國勞動之目前地位、爲國家生活中互相維繫之單位者、並非偶然得之、實乃穩健的民治主義演進中之進化過程、希特勒不此是圖、渠不願爲之、亦不能爲之、渠既剝削個人權利、自必不承認團體權利、無論其爲勞動或事業或學術或宗教也、渠已廢止工團、如摧毀宗教然、美人團體更明瞭納粹統治權在其生活標準與其自由及生命上有何意義者、無過於有組織之勞動、而在擊敗納粹主義·保持基本自由·與保存世界民治主義之工作者負責最大之團體、亦莫過於勞動、</p>
<p>對綏靖派警告　叛國爲人唾棄</p>
<p>吾人已有不少成就、今亟須有更多之成就、人類所經苦境之修短、將由吾人出產爭自由的利器之專心與犧牲決定之、故吾人對於當前之偉大工作、不能有所猶豫、必視美國自由之防衛高於一切私人目的與利益、吾人現從事於偉大而危險之工作、希特勒已放縱在暴力量於世界矣、吾人必竭力以制服之、否則此種力量、難免於吾人處理自己事務以保護本國正當利益時施於吾人、擊敗希特勒之工作或需時既久、且非容易、於是有少數綏靖派與同情納粹者認爲事不可能、並請余與希特勒談判而乞勝利者之唾餘、彼等直欲余成爲近代之阿諾爾德（十八世紀末葉美國革命時之叛國者）而出賣余所寶貴之自由與宗教及國家耳、余已拒絕之而一再拒絕之、及當余謂吾人定竭其所能、以摧毀希特勒與共納粹力量時、余知余實代表美國人民之天良與決心而發此言、美國工農商興各界人民、今皆負有慘淡經營在永遠基礎上造成民治世界之鉅大責任與權利、他年美國總統在將來勞動節能謂吾人忠實盡責、此余所期盼者也、</p>
<h3>英澳歡迎</h3>
<p>路透社二日倫敦電　美總統羅斯福之勞工節演說歐洲方面因受惡劣天氣影響不易收聽、但倫敦之短波無线電聽衆皆聆得大部份演辭、羅總統之演說鎭定而端詳、以抑揚之語調、言及納粹威脅全世界勞動之標準、透露其沉着之信念、頗使聽衆感動、演說凡十五分鐘、完畢時軍樂隊奏美國歌、</p>
<p>路透社二日倫敦電　路透社外交訪員稱、美總統羅斯福之現實的語調、及其勸人勿低估當前危機之警告、倫敦方面予以贊同、近數週來英相邱吉爾與外相艾登均巳發出勿輕敵之警告、今美總統巳迅予響應而剴切言之、美國加連戰具生產至最大限度少決心、至爲此間所歡迎、而羅總統表示此種決心、足見其顯知接濟方面之亟切需要、倫敦人士對此、允感欣慰、</p>
<p>路透社二日康白拉電　澳新首相法登評述羅斯福總統演說云、此决演說產生兩項意義重大之現象、（一）警告勿因德國戰爭機構之顯然遲鈍而自滿、（二）斷然痛斥主張與希特勒言和之任何提議、此實予軸心國所抱美國不準備擁護民主國到底之希望、以最後之致命打擊云、</p>
<h3>東報冷嘲熱諷</h3>
<p>路透社二日東京電　日本「廣知時報」咋日載文、評論羅斯幅總統所發一吾人非好戰之人民、吾人不事侵略」一言、謂侵略有用軍隊者有不用軍隊者、美政府自以武力佔領菲列濱羣島後、即從事在遠東侵略、而於穩健者之假面具下對第三國施政治壓力、以維持中國之戰事、其國務院則干涉遠東各國間之事務、要知經濟武器之懲創力不亞於海陸軍、美國抱遠東政治帝國之幻想乃藉聯盟煽動建篆防禦工事，實施杯葛封鍰、供給戰品與一方面、而禁止運往另一方面、以告成其霸權、凡此一切皆美國之侵略也、昔日華盛頓總統之政策、爲小與聞外國糾紛、而注力於本國土地而、近年來之美政府則巳放棄此政治家風度矣、實則其政策並非爲民治協的國之利益計云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>德蘇戰爭檢討</h3>
<p>德蘇戰爭已經十一個禮拜了，德國南北兩路並進。而實際則側重烏克蘭的第三次攻勢，這幾天來，顯然已呈現了衰微與停滯。尼泊河上的鬥爭，例寗格拉附近，都已經入於拉鋸戰的狀態。德國如果要企圖向前再進。那末，牠就勢必要作史大的犧牲與努力，發動第四决大規模的進攻。意思就是說，牠還要添加百萬以上的生力軍，飛機坦克等各數千，一舉而投入更劇烈的血戰。德國現在所能動用的力量。是不是可以允許牠這樣做，固然是一個比較决要問題；但希特拉於整個戰略。對現在時機是吾適宜這一點。都不得不加以深長嚴重的考慮。</p>
<p>德國對蘇聯的閃電戰，一開始就採取了非常猛烈的姿態。經過了蘇聯的堅決抵抗、不久就呈現了衰微，這是第一决攻勢。這一時期的結果，蘇聯在全面戰綫上，大體都向後退撒，紅軍前方主力及、後方援軍，紛紛在一九三九年九月以前的舊國境內，從事調動與集中。戰事短期僵持後。德國就增加了生力軍，再作第二度的鉅大攻勢，這一度，德國方面最大的收穫，是佔領了中路的明斯克，斯摩倫斯克等要地。可是在空前人與物的消耗下，德國這度攻勢·不久又入了沉滯狀態。於是，德國爲要澈底達到自己的戰爭目的，不得不被迫而作更多的犧牲，這就是現在漸漸就要停滯的第三次攻勢。這是歷史上從未有過的大規模戰鬥！據邱吉爾宣稱，兩方面前後所用軍力，已一共有六百萬人，而蘇聯所發表的正式統計，則稱德軍人的損失已達到了二百萬，飛機與坦克兩項損失，也都各超過了五千。可是檢討這十一個禮拜的戰鬥過程，德軍除了佔領一些土地外，其餘在戰略戰術兩方面成就·都可說完全是零。好幾决的包圍，突人，與鉗形運動，都沒有能重演法國馬奇諾防綫守軍全部被俘，或比利時全軍降服的故事。而甚至奧迪薩被切斷後，德方所預言鄧扣克式的撤退，直到現在，也依然沒有能夠出現。但在相反力面，蘇聯孤軍的固守奧迪薩，德軍佔領區域內後方遊擊戰的發動，空中優勢的始終保持，以及局部反攻的勝利等等，都是蘇聯在這决抗戰中所表現的特點，，而予國際觀察者以非常深刻的印象、</p>
<p>現在放在德軍面前最切迫的問題，就是蘇聯境內不久後的冬季來到。德軍在第三次攻勢裏，中路完全取的守勢。北路方面，列髯格拉軍區百萬以上大軍的固守，無論德國用怎樣大的力量進攻、大概也不會在冬季以前，就可見到分曉。所以看起來，一俟冬季到來之後，從北冰洋起一直到烏克蘭邊境，所有大規模的軍事動作，都小得不暫告停頓。至於南路方面，如果德軍能在冬季以前衝過烏克蘭·達到高加索一帶，那末，牠當然可以在此較溫和的氣候下，繼續作戰，而衝向近東與印度：吾則，牠就祇有轉換路綫，實行衝入土耳其，再向近東推進。可是，以過去十一個禮拜德軍前進的速率爲此例，德國要想由烏克蘭突出到高加索及近東，事實上，第四度的大進攻，恐怕還未見能夠達到目的，而必須有第五，第六，甚至史多决新攻擊的發動。每决都要添上一百萬或二百萬的生力軍，幾千架飛機與幾千輛坦克。這無論在人或在物的方面。都不是德國現有資源所可允許的。因而推想起來，牠或許就要向抵抗力比較薄弱的土耳其衝進，亦未可知。不過那樣一來，牠父多樹一個敵人，逼土耳其加入英，蘇方面共同作戰。當然，德·義在解決蘇聯軍事機構可能消失後，必須於退守或突圍二者中選擇其一，是非常明顯的。可是，退守就等於接受失敗，而坐等英，蘇反攻的到來：但另一方面，即使在全力突圍的前途上，也依然沒有一點成功的希望。德·義失敗的命運，經過十一個禮拜來德，蘇的劇烈戰鬥，可算是愈加充分顯明了。</p>
<p>那末，今後全世界目光所集中的，就祗有在兩點之上：第一，蘇聯的反攻，第二，英·美的配合與反攻行動。蘇聯軍力方面，無論根據平時大家估計或這决實際戰鬥過程，都證明牠完全有轉守爲攻　實力與準備。英·美方面，從牠們的種種表示與措施上，也可斷定牠們最後與蘇聯一致動作，一舉而擊潰侵略者的決意與魄力，是沒有問題的。所以實際上，這兩點僅是一個問題的兩面。在英，蘇完全軍事同盟的形勢下，牠們當然會等候適當時機，一舉而同時進擊。時機遲早當然無法預料；但大體可以預料的。這最後的動作，一定是以協同姿態出現，而不是單獨行動。所以最近英，蘇會師伊朗，除了迎頭堵截德，義東進外，也可認爲是這個共同大反攻的前奏曲。</p>

<p>路透社二日東京電　情報局代理發言人偉岸一今日招待外籍新聞訪員時、有問及日美在華盛頓之談判情形者、發言人答曰、余審在此階段中、以少說話爲佳、有問昨夜馬淵所發之演說、與日政府所抱對華盛頓談話之政策有無關係、發言人答曰無、蓋彼僅就一般日人之立塲發言、而未特殊涉及日美之談話也、余意就馬淵之言論而作猜測、將成錯誤、發言人繼拒絕對日美關係續發言論、而日羅斯福已言之矣、太平洋太廣闊、而不容輕於發言、某訪員問如談判卒歸決裂、是吾似將有嚴重之局勢繼之而起、發言人曰、談判目前仍在進行中、未可加以批評、况首相近衛致羅斯福總統之函、日政府迄今尚未接覆、有問首相之函在最近之將來有發表其全文之象吾、發言人答稱、目前未能下斷、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電　日本陸軍報道班長馬淵大佐、昨發「東亞日廣播稱日本必須衝破ABCD之包圍、如果必要、將用武力行之、坐以待斃、實愚不可及、今料日本將作激烈之外交上努力、以圖克服日本所遭遇茶嚴重之危機、但此等努力如果失敗則將被迫運用武力、而不顧戰爭將歷多久、在挽救吾人偉大歷史之殊死爭鬥中、縱戰至最後一人並夷我土地爲灰燼亦所不惜云、馬淵之演說及日本軍界所表示之情緒、與日政府官員之審槇態度截然相反、彼等現皆待美總統羅斯福與日相近衛間折衝之結果、</p>

<p>但無論現款或放賬顧客所購汽油、俱以本年四月至六月平均購油量爲限、新顧客往亞細亞服務站添油者、無論現款與記賬、皆被回絕、上述三家油公司、均表示此等新條規、將繼續實施至另發通知時爲止、亞細亞公司致顧客之通告內、有「公司存底與接濟情况好轉時、立當通知顧客不誤」等語、然亞細亞公司及其餘兩公司中人、俱切言汽油接濟並未大减、而限制出售志在防人囤積居奇、美孚某員稱、該公司之汽油存底稍見减少、但正隨時補足中、汽油之接濟、亦可無慮、</p>
<p>囤積徵象</p>
<p>僅因目下航業失常、故未能確知下批汽油何時運到、然已有投機份子企圖乘機囤積汽油之徵象、故實行新條規、意在預防囤積、而以保護未能購貯大量汽油之汽車主、不然、汽車主將受重大損失云、</p>
<p>日方限制</p>
<p>據日文上海每日新聞記載云、日方因汽油關係國防極重要、故決定加以統制、南京日本商民、刻已開始實行、至其限制辦法、亦於一日下午三時、經南京日方決定公布如下、營業用汽車、每日准用汽油二加侖、營業用卡車、准用汽油三加侖、私人自用汽車、每日准用汽油一加侖、自用卡車、准用汽油一加侖、並決定實行購油領證制、若杉、並倡導一滴汽油一滴血之口號、勸告日人極力節約、</p>
<h3>今日爲歐戰　兩週年　外僑默勝利　並不舉行儀式</h3>
<p>今日爲歐戰第一週年紀念日、一九三九年九月一日、德國發動對波蘭戰事、置英國要求撤退波蘭德軍之哀的美敦書於不復、英國遂於前年今日、正式對德官戰、繼之以法國宣戰、於是歐洲大戰再度爆發、影響所被遍及世界、滬市爲國際性之都市、兩年以還、和界當局、嚴維中立性之地位、各方均表深切同情、今日值歐戰二週年、各國僑民、愛國情　、除默禱祖國最後勝利外、並不舉行何種紀念儀式、英法德荷比挪等各國領署、亦均照常處理公務、</p>
<h3>各業被凍結資金　均可申請解封　各銀行資金已解封完竣</h3>
<p>自英美兩國應中國政府之請求、實施封鎖中國資金後、財政部爲維護中國正當商人合法貿易、以及安定滬市人心起見、與英美商定、予中央銀行以解封特權、凡國人遭受凍結之資金、均得請求中央銀行代爲解封、業已由部規定辦法、通知中央銀行遵照辦理、新聲社記者昨向中央銀行上海分行探悉、該行經英美特准授予解封中國資金之特權後、對於經營外滙業務之華商銀行遭受凍結資金、已由該行代爲收解、予以解封、八月期買進賣出外滙、業已自行軋平、代爲收解辦理完竣、關於華商銀行以前所收受之外匯存款、亦得徵各存戶之同意、轉存中央銀行、或照部定市價、即美金九元十六分之五、英鎊三辦士二十二分之五、售給中央銀行、各業所有外滙、得存入中央銀行、照原幣開立新戶或售給之、惟個人支票、須由銀行扣保、各業如因正當用途、欲提出原幣外滙、應先依法辦理申請手續、經核准後、以原幣外滙支付、如係訂購必需品、不得與修正之禁止進口貨物辦法相牴觸、並須連同定貨合約發票、以及各項證明文件、送請審核、</p>
<h3>出口滙票有限　影響匯市</h3>
<p>但最近輸出擁擠　匯票將大量供市</p>
<p>昨日（二日）黑市匯率、商人需求增加、就大體言、一般人之印象、認爲本埠黑市塲恐將繼績存在、因本市各銀行除匯豐仍照法定匯率掛牌外、其餘大抵均買賣黑匯、但出口匯票、發出數額至爲有限、本市匯率之變動、並不與供求成止比例、其原因或即在此、昨據一般人揣測、最近離埠之美國輪船裝載大批貨物、當使外匯市塲內出口匯票之供給、大爲增加、</p>
<p>標金買賣　傳有決議</p>
<p>泰晤士報云、上海標金市塲內、多空雙方、對於八月份期貨結價標準發生爭執、空頭堅主依照平準會規定之匯豐掛牌結價、多頭則堅主依照黑市匯率結價、經會商結果、已決定折衷辦法、一塲紛爭、至此始告平息、惟因九月期結價辦法迄未決定、故期貨交易、繼續停市、若干商人依照匯豐掛牌五元三一二五、購取美匯、頗感困難、甚或不可能、是否將採用黑市匯率作爲結價標準、或按照八月期金結價辦法採用法定與黑市匯率之折衷數、刻尚在進行商談中、昨晨金市同業繼續會商、俾決定維持標金買空賣空之新辦法、據悉昨已獲有決議、規定開價爲九千元至九千一百四十元、但關於期貨交易及九月期結價辦法、仍未獲有決定、</p>

<p>載瓜代兵一批　確實人數未詳</p>
<p>美海軍部運輸艦漢得遜號、由美載軍需品循檀香山關島各海軍根據地來滬、原定八月三十日抵滬、旋復電致此間美海軍當局、准於九月二日到滬、頃據呂宋美砲艦史密斯官員稱、渠所獲消息、該艦當以航途延遲關係、惟或可於今日抵滬、該艦此來載有瓜代兵一批來滬塡防、確實人數、史氏未詳、無從探悉、由日撤退來滬之美海陸軍武官準乘該艦撤退、美第四海軍聯隊士兵、在東方服務期滿者、聞有五六十名、亦將附艦離去、</p>
<h3>運米小工　偷取白米</h3>
<p>昨日上午九時、法捕房突派中西探捕三十餘人、乘車馳至太古輪船公司堆棧前、施行戒備、對正在碼頭搬運米糧上棧之工人、按名施行搜查、發覺有工人四十餘名、身畔共藏有白米一袋、乃將各工人拖上卡車、駛往盧家灣捕房、旋因太古公司當局急待起卸貨物、遂電知捕房、請予從寬釋放、始恢復工作、</p>
<h3>宵禁通行證　換發新證</h3>

<h3>鮑登赴新加坡　負責疏通供應　新加坡已成英活動中心　鮑氏調任代表適應時勢</h3>
<p>字林報云、澳洲駐華商務專員鮑登、不久將離滬赴新加坡就任新職、名銜爲澳洲正式代表、有權處理政治·商務·與行政事宜、鮑登既將另就新職、澳政府駐華商務專員公署（設於上海）亦從昨日（一日）起停閉、</p>
<p>滬公署無　維持必要</p>
<p>但該公署停閉之重要原因、爲澳洲實施戰時限制、已禁止輸出、故澳政府感覺不必徒耗此公署之維持費、觀於新加坡現成東半球央帝國防務與活動之集中地點、鮑登之被任爲正式代表、移駐新加坡、殊合情理、蓋鮑登熟稔遠東事務也、</p>
<p>鮑登負責　溝通供應</p>
<p>茲後澳洲與馬來兩政府間任何種磋商、尤其是關於供應者、將由鮑登以正式代表資格、從中溝通、並有商務秘書與政治官員各一人、助其辦理一切外交與商務事宜、昨據鮑登談稱、歐戰結束後、中國將大量採辦澳洲之羊毛與製成貨物、而於中國特別重要者、將爲澳洲工業製成貨物之運入云</p>
<p>日內離滬　遄赴新任</p>
<p>鮑登在滬、交游頗廣、今將惜別於兩週內偕其夫人啟程前往新加披、不久並擬返澳一行、領其兩女、以聚天倫之樂、</p>
<p>按鮑登於一九三五年九月六日抵滬、就任駐華商務專員、其前曾僑居中國逾二十年、而以一八八六年誕生於澳洲雪梨埠、世界大戰時、會編人英遠征軍、在法境作戰、一九一九年三月復員、得少校級、曾著小說兩册、頗負聲譽、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市場盡翻雲覆雨之能　漲跌頻繁叵耐貨多　昨日小絞曾一度跌進十元關　又借謠啄再來一個倒翻觔斗</h3>
<p>昨日洋米、先疲後緊、早市開手、仍惕於上日餘勢、依然虛浮、實銷既呆、皮球生意亦淸、原根客販亟圖脫手、各價步跌、迄中市、若高貨一號西貢曾跌至一百二十四五元、次貨僅一百十八元、二號暹羅一百零八元、銀行棧小絞一百十元、外械一百零八元半、至此跌透之餘、方因引起補空之風及一般浮囤散戶認小絞已進百十元大關、似可暫趨平穩、或向盤旋之途、不的而同紛起吸收、市形漸見反疲還緊、繼因謠諑紛起、外滙縮、美日和平絕望、均屬利多之說、乃引起大戶之扳吸、皮球之跳躍、市乃急促上升、小絞乃大至一百十二元半尚在看好、又英華司現一百三十元半至一百三十四元半、路一百四十元至一百四十一元、二號暹盤一百二十四元半至一百二十九元半、碎米九十八元至十九元半、比之前市反見較大元許、成交加至一萬七八千包、英華司達千外噸、後形又復望好、</p>
<p>米商雖在翻雲覆雨、其無如大量洋米仍有到埠、太古公司蘇州輪、前日（一日）傍晚抵滬、由香港裝來洋米二萬四千包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、怡和洋行明生輪昨晨到埠、亦由香港運來洋米一萬六千包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、又華倫洋行格蘭輪此决由仰光直接運來洋米二千八百噸、的計二萬八千五百餘包、昨晨進口停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、咋日三輪共裝來洋米六萬八千五百餘包、故米商無論如何搗亂、事實所在、即使有事故發生、上海民食當不至倉皇無所措也、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、續以到貨轉旺、人心不振、去路即懈、貨主售意亦鬆、所以厚薄粳行情悉續步落二三元不等、開南港早稻百五十七元至百五十五元、無錫原包特粳百五十四元、大市百四十七元、宿次爲四十二三元、浦東新粳相隨並降二元左右、開百五十六元、爲五十五元半、</p>
<p>糯米銷塲亦仍不暢、故價續貶一二元、不過高特貨以市上乏貨關係、頗屬堅固、仍須開百二十八元、普通高自百二十五六元、次至百二十元、糯茶供求相仿未有榮辱、繼售百十四元、次至百十元、</p>
<h3>洋粉跌進關　昨又脫穎而出</h3>
<p>洋粉連朝疲跌過甚、已引起新大戶之注神、緣定價劃低後雖一再喧傳新交易成交、然前晚電洽廿八元之坎粉復電作罷、故在實際上並無新定在近日成議、且法定外匯能吾請求順利、尚難頂料、而本粉枯乏則早見事實、回籠本粉老車兵船久站於卅四元間、昨又缺貨見俏、故早晨開市、大戶吸收於前、浮多購買於後、轉口幫亦趁低問津、金龍牌東棧開價卅元〇四角、繼至卅元〇六角、西棧卅元至卅元〇二角、砲臺卅一元八角至卅二元、午後因外匯緊縮、米糧回振、皮球幫在謠言利多之際更從而活躍、貨主扳俏、客囤競買、價父騰起元外、金龍東棧自卅一元半至卅一元七角西棧卅一元一角至五角半、收市卅一元四角半、砲臺亦達卅二元六角、香蕉白菜等雜牌開三十二元、比之前日較大近元至一元五七角不等、成交二萬多包、本粉三十四元一二角、僅有二三百包點綴、麩皮同時喊高半元、日麩三十三元尚不肯暢脫、</p>
<p>小麥到頭仍祇零點綴而已、但除近郊配廠少數外、車輪方面亦間有三數百包之小票抵申、日廠限價四十五元、本廠四十八九元、但昨午米粉回漲、執貨者趁機扳佾、不肯以原盤輕晚云、</p>
<h3>油餅　食油銳降疾進</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、菜油及棉子油期貨買賣頗爲暢盛、投機商先撳後進、極盡變化能事、查晨初開市賣風續濃、多戶傾吐猶力、故行情一度又銳瀉十餘元、嗣以謠風突起、新買重復踴躍而告回漲六七元、結果大致比上日尚軋低五六元、統市成交九月下交大有廠淸油一萬多担、又日華廠菜油六千多桶、至於現貨交易反趨冷落、生豆油更受一般大戶、收羅把持而乏正式市面、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯供不敷求</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌及小櫃檯價格仍未更、美銀行之小櫃檯價爲進口洋行之扒風中、由四元八七五改縮至四元七五、乃英美匯暗市績趨緊縮、亞細亞油洋行及某公司煤斤結款仍多、美商等銀行之微少供給、不敷分配、故美金由四元八四三七五步緊至四元七八一一五、英金亦軟至二辦士八四三七五、下午美孚油洋行亦起扒結、市况更緊難回、終以最緊價收市、交易日旺、</p>
<p>煤油結款仍盛</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市英印均平、美銀及美市匯兌休假無市、英對美滬匯兌亦未更、中央掛牌仍平、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英金二辦士八七五、笑金四元八四三七五、比上日收市英緊〇三一二五、美匯亦軟〇三一二五、開後即趨緊、亞細亞油洋行來扒進現美匯四元八一二五，銀行美商等時稍有供售、匯豐掛牌未更、白銀平衡稅仍徵百分之二四·五〇、煤斤續有結款、亦力結四元八一二五、花旗銀行小櫃檯美匯由四元八七五軟至四元七五、致十一點左右、再起緊勢、午收美匯緊至四元七八一二五、英匯二辦士八四三七五亦緊、</p>
<p>黑市愈趨愈緊</p>
<p>午後某美行竟吸進荷蘭現美金四元七八一二五、致於三點後、美孚油洋行亦起力扒僅四元七五、市况步緊不止、直至四點收市、英金緊至二辦士八二八一二五、美金四元七五、比上日收市、英緊〇七八一二五、美緊一二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市平穩</p>
<p>香港二日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、英美匯俱無變動、申匯日匯亦未開出、有行無市、</p>
<p>天津美匯略緊</p>

<h3>在散漫買風中　現金續漲</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤期交市塲、仍做現金暗市、交易轉稀、市價頗形堅挺、已回出九千一百元大關外，外滙在油·煤洋行扒風中緊俏、各方人心未免被帶上、自晨初由成記進合盛四十兩、永豐餘進德孚十兩、價已升至九千一百元、比上日做高二十元、嗣在散漫買風中績漲、福康永進永成十兩、九千一百二十元，德孚進時和二十兩、九千一百三十元、祥和進福康永·立泰·萬豐各十兩、爲九千一百五十元、後有求少供、抬起五十元、始續有成交、順源進大豐二十兩、明豐進永豐餘二十兩、價已升至九千二百元、十點一刻後、成記復出予福康永三十兩、爲九千一百九十元、明豐出德孚二十兩、九千一百七十元、午刻九千一百八十元有買戶、下午中興售予順源十兩、價九千一百九十元、後未成交、價比上日回升一百十元、當日高低達一百元、交易僅二百數十兩金號本牌金售價九千二百五十元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金再大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行與新同行於十點十五分掛升十元、計九百四十元、收進减五十元云、</p>
<p>期貨結價在熟商中</p>
<p>咋晚五時聯易公會召集四十家經紀人會議討諭、今後之期金新結價、會方提出、以現金·英金鎊·英金栗·美金鎊·美金票·英滙·美滙·香港票等八種、混合扯價作爲新結價、由會方五人及金號幫銀號幫證券幫錢兌業各二人共十三人、組織評價委員會、至每月底評訂結爲本月期未淸籌碼之軋平了結價、今日特繼續會議討論、若得某方通過、明日（週四）或有開做新交易之望、</p>
<h3>紗花　利多之因素太多　紗價奔騰昂然直上　雙馬出七百元關…期紗補空殷切</h3>
<p>迴旋兩日之紗市、昨則驟回昂、實緣盛傳美日和平空氣又告消散、一般拋賣之額、鑒於瞄頭不靈、蠢然思抵補、於是檯風一轉、買氣更濃、根本問題、還係游資充斥、財力充足之戶、吸收之額、按兵勿動、皆係投機的人們、滾進滾出、賣者一擁、市盤乃直下、空方既能獲利、欲思撈進、而貿勢一強、漲力益熾矣、反之一鬆、則又大降、據市塲流言、有人在市搜羅棉布之說、又以爲定洋花難得外匯、所以人心振盪、情况隨之上升、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千穴百九十五元、低價一千六百八十二元、午後因取引所價盤盤趨昂、棉紗比上日在漲四五十元、棉布漲一元七八角、由此雙馬被其激動、初做一千六百九十六元、以後逐步漲至一千七百〇七元、收盤價爲一千七百〇六元、場外做一千七百〇九元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市况則昂、首盤價爲一千六百八十二元、少頃漲至一千穴百八十七元、繼後取引所價上、人氣續挺、在此八十七·八元之間往返爲時頗久、但客銷欠佳、港幫納胃甚滞、所以情况平平、同時成交亦屬不旺、一經在八十八元之間、迨至取引所收盤價續升、於是人心打擊、浮空失望抵補、市盤乃步步回高至一千六百九十四元、收盤以後續挺、查半日間成交統計六千六百十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分別如左、香港二〇同行六、五〇〇統計六、六一〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、雖消息依然恍惚不解、而走勢漸漸上升、近日來多空角逐、每多逢高拋出、與見低吸收之傾肌、是以市價兔起鶻落、升降靡定、當晨　開出即以廠單上昂、人心向榮、故散空扒補、多頭爭購、乃九月期開盤爲一千六百〇二元、即漲六元、十月期爲一六〇三〇元、亦升十二元五角、十一月期爲一六四九元、好上六元、入後以取引所逐步見高、乃投機家與多方憑藉吸收、勢殊逼切、前市成交九千三百三十包、午後市氣更爲挺硬、近期、會高達一千六百元、十月期漲至一六二八元、十一月期好至一六六七元、僅上午稍有回頭、而下午之上漲、因殊鮮特別賣出、故回風甚微、觀其脚地雖因美棉無市、而取引所之上升、乃爲引起買戶所憑藉之最大主因、結果九月　爲一六一五元、十月期爲一六四三元、十一月期爲一六六六元五角、收市各漲二十餘元不等、全日共成交一萬七千九百九包、比上日减少二千七百八十包、叉截至一日止三個月存賬欺量、爲二萬三千六百二十包、內九月期存七千一百五十包、十月期存九千三百九十包、十一月期存七千零八十包、再將一日間開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤價）</p>
<h3>棉欵恐不易得外匯　洋花防阻　現棉已抬國紗價</h3>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况頗屬堅定、但因棉款甲請手績不易核准之影響、定貨交易、仍無起色、同時少數花號家亦有轉而注向現棉之羅致、蓋若以不能得標準外滙而訂購外棉、前途頗多週折、且來期遙遠、絕無營業上之把握、豈不捨之而進購現棉、得益良多、頂料因棉紗已有向榮之趨勢、一切外棉來源、却忽有不可能的艱難、現棉市况將轉盛無疑也、一</p>
<p>纽約棉市、咋日爲美國勞動節、棉市循例休業一天、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因空頭抵補而漲、繼之又因多頭獲利了結跌、但續後市况再因大衆買進、而漲勢猛烈、結果昨日收盤價格、各漲十羅比左右、叉預測今日開盤市况尚平、與收盤價格不相上下、</p>

<h3>糖市　糖價迅速回升</h3>
<p>咋糖市因黑市外匯告緊、又謠傳將停止供給、故趨勢突緊、回漲甚勁、而「阿福」氣息已告消散、亦原因之一、現貨二四粗白公會劃盤、八月份入口一百二十五元半·二十六元一角、下午二十八元半·二十九元半·二十八元八角、七月份一百二十五元三角·二十八元半、六月份一百二十五元·二十八元、均升四元許、四月份一百二十四元、升一元、荷赤KD嘜）百二十元、NT嘜一百十四元·十元、均升一元、香港粗白一百二十元至二十二元、升三元、太古車白B嘜及HX均原價未動、公司期貨二四粗白九月十日交割者一百二十五元四角·二十五元七角·二十七元九角、下午二十八元半·十一元·二十八元二角、升三元二角、九月二十日一百二十六元·二十七元九角·二十九元、下午一百三十元七角、二十九元七角·六角、升三元半、統共成交期貨三萬二千餘包、現貨九千餘包、本一號冰一百六十三元、晶明冰一百六十五元、升八元、二日有糖進口、自杳港運來一千零七十包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤行家　漸知正義　開始現售不出貨單</h3>
<p>白煤行情、一般囤戶、以爲出月又須再漲、把持不出、但結果則大謬不然、蓋匯市放長、來源不斷、行家對於同業少數現售、業已開始供給、惟不出棧單、以防囤積、確係應時平市之道、各行家不但宜以有限制的現貨、供給同業、並應以相當限額之煤量、隨時直接供應用戶之需求、在洋行家享利如常、在用戶不患無煤、亦不虞局操縱所壓迫、若各洋行仍祇供給大囤戶、以及大小同業、則是與囤戶一鼻孔出氣、雖係「要吃羊腦子、不顧羊性命、」而使黑煤化成血、不慮多行不義將自斃、昨日以行家稍顧正理、現貨供給、不出棧單、囤戶亦無所肆其技、故人心安定、市氣巳平、本街門莊月前黑市搜羅棧單、成本較昂、籂塊每噸五百四十元、提塊五百六十元、送到客戶、車力在內云</p>

<h3>葉元龍揖盜</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>昨日本報載有重慶大學校長葉元龍揖盜記，述盜見葉一寒至此，忻然受葉所出巳敝狐裘而去。吾人讀此，有感於盜亦尙知寒士之不忍相欺，盜亦有道歟？</p>
<p>以今日生活程度之高漲，文人淸寒，本無足奇，甚或必然。葉氏以學府之長，淸風兩袖，家無長物，敎授已成「教瘦」，則推而至於小學敎師，其淸寒情形，自更可想而知。</p>
<p>然而文人淸寒，正是其可貴處，君子憂道不憂貧，葉氏膺敎育英才之重責，爲民族復興樹刻苦耐勞之風聲，爲靑年學子立廓然大公之正道，葉氏亦可謂安貧樂道矣！</p>
<p>文人之鍥而不舍，明道而不計其功，淸寒正是其試金石，淸寒何足慮。</p>

<h3>溪南草堂隨筆</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>孟蘭盆會（二）</p>
<p>燄口本爲餓鬼之稱。相傳阿難尊者獨坐靜室，夜見一餓鬼，名燄口，身體枯瘦，咽如針，口吐火燄，告阿難曰：後三日汝命盡，將生餓鬼中。阿難恐，問免苦之方便。鬼曰：汝明日爲我等百千餓鬼及諸婆羅門仙人等各施一斛食，且爲我供養三寳，則汝增壽，我得生天。阿難以白佛，佛即說陀羅尼，曰誦此陀羅尼，能使無量百千施食充足，此即瑜伽燄口之由來。故燄口中吹海螺，及作咒語手印，（即首座之佾用兩手之指作種種手勢也）皆循密宗之儀軌，凡學密宗者，日常修法必施食，並不爲奇。茲姑無論其爲盂蘭盆會，爲瑜伽燄口，要之皆爲超度餓鬼，故所重在施食。餓鬼之有無，施食之是吾，事屬宗敎，爲另一問題。奈今之燄口，徒　絲竹鐘鼓之悅耳動聽，法器燈光之燦爛奪目，而於救濟餓鬼之本意，幾全失之，非以超度，簡直鬧鬼，末俗流弊，抑何可笑！</p>
<p>相傳和尙至奉召各種鬼道之後，例必持咒退鬼，而有所謂退鬼咒，實則即爲觀世音菩薩心咒，唵嘛呢叭噸吽之六字眞言也。西遊記中，述唐僧之緊箍咒，能使神通廣大之孫行者，倒地打滾，哀哀求饒，亦即此六字眞言。現在每逢燄口，必供有紙紥靑面之神，旁立城隍土地，或爲畫像，此靑面之神，即觀世音菩薩之化身，名曰鬼王，蓋照佛敎中說，觀世音菩薩不僅救人，亦且救鬼，故作種種之化身也。</p>

<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「要不是吳梅影在半個月前回去的時候出了什麼事，一定是她在前幾天進城來的路上，遭到了什麽意外，這封信倒是不能不替她拆開的。」王舍監的腦神經才轉了這麼兩轉，便毫不遲疑的把信拆開了。</p>
<p>信的內容倒並不長，她那一對老不花眼鏡裏却足足使她呆坐了一刻多鐘。</p>
<p>「她父親說許久不見她的信，這分明是在她回去的時候就失踪的。」出了這樣的事，王舍監當然不能不就去報告方校長：「那天是正月十四，她家裏突然派人來找她回去，說是她父親給人家打壞了，吳梅影這孩子倒也很仔細，起身以前，還特地來跟我商量，說那來人有一些可疑，不巧，那一天我……」</p>
<p>王舍監說順了嘴，險些把那一天自己喝醉了酒的話也說出來，還虧驚覺得早，便來不及的自己糾正。</p>
<p>「不巧，那一天我有些頭疼，沒精神給她細想，便匆匆准了她的假，讓她回去了。如今看起來，說不定眞是一個騙局！」說着，王舍監又忍不住深深地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>方校長低下頭，沉思了好一會。（二〇一）</p>
<h3>螢光燈何由而來</h3>
<p>— 義道</p>
<p>自愛迪生發明電燈後，螢光燈可說是科學上的新貢獻。螢光燈第一决的應用，在一九三八年，那時舉行的紐的和舊金山博覽會的會塲，裝有千萬支顏色鮮美的螢光炬，所以雖在黑夜，塲中仍如白晝，但是當時遊客，却不知道是螢光，都以爲祇是普通的電炬設計而已，直到最近一年來，螢光燈才風行各地，世界各國，現在裝設螢光燈的，日以千計。</p>
<p>螢光燈的發明</p>
<p>自德斐爵士發明弧光燈，經愛迪生改良成炭條燈，再經各科學家改善爲鎢絲燈後，其中五十年來，雖經各大科學家的改良，其最大缺點，仍爲電力十分浪費，譬如，一隻鶴絲燈泡中，消耗於熱的電力，佔總量百分之九十，所以螢光燈的發明，可說是歷年來工程師理想的實現。</p>
<p>螢光的原理，很早巳有人知道，但是雖有許多科學家多次實騐，仍沒有滿意的結果。直到歲年前，奇異公司的英孟氏（George　Inman），發明了一種粉劑，如果塗在一條充滿汞氣的玻璃管內壁，再將玻璃管的兩端通電後，就有非常悅目的螢光從管中射出來。這燈經美國西電公司和海格公司的改良後，就成爲現在的螢光燈。</p>
<p>螢光燈的特點</p>
<p>螢光燈最大的特點，就是效率高，省電，他供給的照光（Mumination），較電燈一大倍，而熱量的產生，却比電燈小一半，第二個特點，就是螢光燈的光比電燈光來得凉爽，和柔，所以在螢光燈下工作，不致傷目。第三個特點，是螢光燈能發出各種顏色的光來，而不用將燈管漆色。</p>

<h3>海上鎳幣潮</h3>
<p>— 阿忙</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一九四一初秋在上海從巿塲到小巷，鎳幣掀起了海潮。</p>
<p>上海是不毛的地方，沒有礦苗，也沒有礦工，可是也有礦苗，也有礦工，在從前一個時候，廢銅爛鐵値銅鈿，於是敝舍的一對銅門環也被人權作礦苗，挖掘了去，而失了一番堂皇氣象，至今想來，是很使人傷心。</p>
<p>現在鎳的價値抬到雲霄，原因是收做飛機的原料，於是鎳幣旣有升天資格，就高漲起來了——上海的鎳礦是種植在太太少奶奶的私房，小孩們的玩具箱裏，因爲收羅家忘了這件小東西，現在方才想到有利可圖……</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>你看，殷先生今日特別客氣的對他黃臉婆了：「阿毛娘，你那私蓄的小鎳角子，民國二十五年的，拿出來，我跟你去換花花綠綠的鈔票！」</p>
<p>阿毛娘撅着嘴：「呃，連小鎳角子也不許我頑；換鈔票，有甚麽高興，鎳幣也不是錢嗎？五分，一角，也値不了多少的！」</p>
<p>殷先生哈哈一笑：「這就叫婦人家，不懂得外面的行情，你知道鎳幣現在多値錢，一塊五分幣史可換六七塊大洋呢！」</p>
<p>阿毛娘一驚：「呀，這樣貴，前幾天還給阿毛玩落去五六隻。」</p>
<p>殷先生好像落去六塊錢法幣，連忙問：「落在那裹，那裏；快些尋，快些尋！</p>
<p>阿毛娘吐吐呑呑地：「總不外乎牆脚壁縫。」</p>
<p>殷先生脫下長衫，蹲下去找了——在掘鎳礦，鞋盒子滾在地上，揚起一層灰。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>鎳幣更漲了：五分一塊換八九元，一角一塊換七元，兩角一塊換五元……</p>
<p>五金店做起副業來：「兼收鎳幣，」小小的牌子掛着。</p>
<p>收錫箔灰的販子拉長了喉嚨，或是低聲的伸進一個頭：一鎳幣有哦！」——他們大多比「市價」少去一兩塊錢，他們便賺到這一點，這新的副業，反顯出他們本業的淸淡來…」</p>
<p>在錢莊前，有的拒收，有的却暗暗的幹這批交易：鎳幣淌了進去，鈔票淌了出來，淌着，淌着——無形的淌着。</p>
<p>爲人爲己　服務事業化　心源</p>
<p>任何人在幹自己事業的時候，都能盡心竭力，全神貫注的。可是當替人服務時，總是敷衍塞責，抱着「做日和尙撞日鐘」的主義；要知任何一種職業，它間接或直接，都有關大衆的禍福。因之，你表面上雖祇是替某一私人服務，實際上你把它處理得疏忽了，不但大家要受着你的損害。就是你自己也蒙受極大的不利；至於雇主的損失，倒是最小的。</p>
<p>因爲你自己養成了敷衍馬虎的習慣，以後要你幹任何一種事業時，一方面缺乏着積極的精神，一方面缺乏着經騐，於是你不論替人服務，幹日己事業，祇有給人淘汰了：所以我們在「依人作嫁」時，也要當自己的事業一樣，努力從事，全神貫注，盡心盡力的做得好，且要無可再好。</p>
<p>如美國鋼　大王卡內基，他自述成功的經過說：</p>
<p>「當我十歲在紗廠裹做捲紗學徒時，我決心做世界上第一捲紗學徒，努力工作浩，做了一些時候，給人發覺了，覺得像我這樣的孩子，老叫做捲紗學徒，是很可惜的，於是被雇當郵差。</p>
<p>做了郵差以後，我又立下決心，要做一個出衆的郵差，這樣做了些時，給人賞識而介紹到電報局裏當電報員。嗣後用同一方法，得到今日的成功。」</p>
<p>路特，卡內基做事時所以能如此，完全他們把自己的職務，看做了自己的事業的緣故。而一個人能做到「服務事業化」，那麼，得到最大利益的，還不楚自己嗎！</p>

<h3>建蘭曲敘</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>噓社是新興的崑曲團體，我在文林月刊第三期上巳有專文介紹。前幾天是噓社第一次同期，在夏恂如女士宅第曲叙，並賞建蘭。我一進鬥就嗅到芬芳馥郁的王者之香，加以不少的曲友，眞是「如入芝蘭之室」了。曲臺上和餐桌上以及地上都擺滿了建蘭的盆景，每一盆都是幾朶姿態不同的蘭花開在叢密的蘭葉上面。翻檢夏太太的劇目，竟述四十餘齣，且齣齣能熟背如流，唱得字穩腔正，眞不愧爲老曲家。壁上懸掛了兩張劇照，拆書和梳妝，極爲生動自然。</p>
<p>開塲是恂如和殷菊儂女士的「琴挑」，接着是顏銳和我的「小宴」，潘小姐和殷震賢的「佳期」，蔡漱六女士的「思凡」以及我的「拾畫」。後來殷震一（與震賢像是兄弟，且同爲醫師，實不同宗）也來了，他唱了一齣「迎哭」。</p>
<p>最難得的是兪振飛也於此時趕到，便唱「掃花」，唱得淸越響亮，且富神韻，配以潘小姐曼妙婉轉的歌聲，允得紅花綠葉之妙。此時四座靜聽，萬籟俱寂，大都悠然神往，心脾爲之一爽。</p>
<p>跟着是菊儂的「叫畫」。接上去的是周叔康夫人和姚張韻　的「寄弄」以及汪一的「折陽」。她們三位的曲子平常不大容易聽到，汪小姐還是初從香港回滬的。大　是震一與李希同女士以及漱六合唱游園驚夢，震一唱春香，拿手絹掩着面孔，再拿一把扇子，逼緊了嗓子扭捏的唱，最是發噱，聽奢都逗他笑，於是皆大歡喜。更妙的是壓軸趙曾和謝菊儂配一隻虎，撫臂覺痛，哇呀呀一聲，滿堂喝采；最後把脚重重的一踩，表示他是死了，（虧他想得出）聽者叉大笑地鼓掌，連建蘭也似乎裂開嘴笑了！</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Clearly States: Aid to China and the Soviet Union Policies Remain Unchanged, Vows to Never Compromise with Nazism, and Leaves Room for Mediation in the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd: President Roosevelt's broadcast address yesterday (full text in a separate dispatch), although it did not disclose any new policies or new steps in its existing policies, was welcomed by those who support participation in the war. The president's firm declaration that he would not beg for scraps from Hitler's victories and the Nazi war machine, that the United States should redouble its efforts as Soviet resistance is now slowing down, and that the United States must defeat Germany if it wishes to continue enjoying its existing rights, were all satisfactory to listeners. However, some regret that the president did not state the future direction in clearer terms. It is widely believed that the purpose of this speech is to prepare Americans to give up many of their benefits in order to increase the production of war materials. The president's statement that American soldiers are now being transported to various battlefields every day is a welcome indication that the United States' policy of aiding China and the Soviet Union has not changed and that Washington does not want to appease Japan.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 2nd: President Roosevelt did not specifically mention Japan in his Labor Day speech. Yesterday, it was widely believed that this was to leave room for mediation in the Far Eastern situation. At the same time, well-informed sources pointed out that President Roosevelt's renewed warning that there can be no compromise with aggressors implied that the United States will continue to adopt a firm stance in any negotiations with Japan. This warning is widely regarded as a reassurance to China and the Soviet Union that their position in the world's resistance to aggressors will not be harmed if a peaceful solution is reached to the US-Japan pending issues. President Roosevelt called on the country to increase arms production and provide greater guarantees for the full transportation of war materials. This is seen as a warning to Japan that the United States will continue to aid China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd: Newspapers here all say that President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech was a call to defeat Hitler. The impression in the United States is far more profound than any statement made by President Roosevelt after the Atlantic Conference. The "New York Daily News" called it a personal declaration of war against Hitler. The "New York Times" said that although we have not yet declared war or directly participated in a real war, the position we have adopted will force us to finally take this direct participation when the current policy proves insufficient to defeat Hitler. Most Americans are unwilling to retreat from this position. Some commentators believe that the failure to mention Japan in the speech may indicate that the door to a solution remains open.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Roosevelt's Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd: President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech in the United States did not specifically explain everything, nor did it say that the United States should participate in the war again, but it was a step further than previous public speeches, and guaranteed that the United States would do its best to conquer Hitlerism. The original text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Resolve to Uphold Democracy and Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>Today is an American holiday. We celebrate the rights of free men and women workers. The preservation of these rights is of utmost importance at present, not only for those of us who enjoy these rights, but also for the entire future of Christian civilization. American labor now bears the great responsibility of winning victory in this most barbaric and terrible war. Our factories and workshops are now manufacturing large quantities of war materials on a large scale. These war materials are now being transported by sea and air to various battlefields around the world, and the United States is planning and developing new weapons with unprecedented power in order to maintain democracy. Why are we doing this? Why are we determined to devote our entire industrial efforts to a war that has not touched our territory? We do not seek national glory, we have no interest in aggression, we do not pay attention to the plundering of dictators, and we do not covet an inch of land in any other country. Our great efforts and consistent purpose are due to our recognition that our basic rights—including labor rights—have been threatened by Hitler's violent attempt to rule the world. The British Navy and the fleets of the Netherlands, Norway, and the United States exist for a long time, and the United States Navy will be able to jointly protect maritime freedom. The enemy who seeks to shatter American freedom already knows this, and knows that if the navies of other countries are destroyed, the United States Navy, whether now or in the future, will never be able to maintain maritime freedom to confront an enemy whose power extends to all other countries in the world.</p>
<p>Accelerate Production to Destroy Nazism</p>
<p>The enemy further knows that American production has made great progress last year, and that its products are now being shipped to various battlefields against Hitlerism in increasing numbers every day, but the enemy also knows that American efforts are not yet sufficient. If we do not catch up quickly, increase our production, and protect our products more extensively to reach the front lines safely, the enemy will definitely dare to advance its attacks on new and old battlefields. Anyone who thinks that Hitler has been blocked and stopped, I give a solemn warning that this is a very dangerous speculation. When the enemy's progress is slower than it was a year ago, it is time to strike with twice the strength, so as to eliminate the harm of conquering the world once and for all, and to eradicate the words and thoughts of establishing peace on appeasement. We all know that the free labor system is the foundation of a vibrant democracy. We also know that one of the first actions of the Axis dictators is to sweep away the various principles and standards that labor has established to seek its own maintenance and progress. Therefore, trade unionism is not allowed by dictators, because trade unionism requires complete freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Trade unionism has helped workers in various countries to obtain the dignity they deserve. The current position of American labor, as a unit of mutual maintenance in national life, is not obtained by accident, but is an evolutionary process in the steady development of democracy. Hitler does not want this, he cannot do it, and he will not do it. Since he exploits individual rights, he will certainly not recognize group rights, whether they are labor, business, academia, or religion. He has abolished trade unions, just as he has destroyed religion. American groups are more aware of what Nazi rule means to their living standards, their freedom, and their lives than organized labor, and the group that bears the greatest responsibility in defeating Nazism, maintaining basic freedom, and preserving world democracy is labor.</p>
<p>Warning to the Appeasers: Treason is Despised</p>
<p>We have already achieved a lot, and now we urgently need to achieve more. The length of the suffering that mankind has experienced will be determined by the dedication and sacrifice of our production of weapons to fight for freedom. Therefore, we cannot hesitate about the great work before us, and we must regard the defense of American freedom as higher than all private purposes and interests. We are now engaged in great and dangerous work. Hitler has unleashed violent forces on the world, and we must do our best to subdue them, otherwise these forces will inevitably be applied to us when we handle our own affairs to protect our legitimate interests. The work of defeating Hitler may take a long time and will not be easy. There are a few appeasers and Nazi sympathizers who think it is impossible and ask me to negotiate with Hitler and beg for scraps from the victor. They want me to become a modern-day Arnold (a traitor during the American Revolution in the late 18th century) and betray the freedom, religion, and country that I cherish. I have refused and will refuse again and again, and when I say that we will do everything we can to destroy Hitler and the Nazi forces, I know that I am speaking on behalf of the conscience and determination of the American people. American workers, farmers, businessmen, and people from all walks of life now bear the great responsibility and right to create a democratic world on a lasting foundation. I hope that in the coming years, the American president will be able to say on future Labor Days that we have faithfully fulfilled our responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Britain and Australia Welcome</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: President Roosevelt's Labor Day speech was difficult to hear in Europe due to adverse weather conditions, but shortwave radio listeners in London heard most of the speech. President Roosevelt's speech was calm and detailed, and his tone of voice, which mentioned the Nazi threat to labor standards around the world, revealed his calm belief, which was quite moving to listeners. The speech lasted fifteen minutes, and at the end, the military band played the American song.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that President Roosevelt's realistic tone and his warning not to underestimate the current crisis were approved by London. In recent weeks, British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden have issued warnings not to underestimate the enemy. Now the US President has quickly responded and spoken sincerely. The determination of the United States to increase the production of war materials to the maximum extent is welcomed here. President Roosevelt's expression of this determination shows that he clearly knows the urgent need for supplies, and Londoners are certainly pleased with this.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 2nd: Australian Prime Minister Fadden commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that this speech produced two significant phenomena: (1) warning against complacency due to the apparent slowness of the German war machine, and (2) resolutely condemning any proposals to make peace with Hitler. This is the final fatal blow to the Axis powers' hope that the United States is not prepared to support the democratic countries to the end.</p>
<h3>Eastern Newspaper's Coldly Sarcastic Remarks</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japanese "Kochi Jihō" published an article yesterday commenting on President Roosevelt's statement that "We are not a warlike people, we do not engage in aggression," saying that there are those who use the military for aggression and those who do not use the military. Since the US government occupied the Philippine Islands by force, it has been engaged in aggression in the Far East, and has exerted political pressure on third countries under the guise of stability to maintain the war in China. Its State Council interferes in the affairs between countries in the Far East. It should be known that the punitive power of economic weapons is no less than that of the navy and army. The United States' illusion of a Far Eastern political empire is to incite alliances to build fortifications, implement boycotts and blockades, and supply war materials to one side while prohibiting them from being transported to the other side, in order to achieve its hegemony. All of this is American aggression. In the past, President Washington's policy was to be less involved in foreign disputes and to focus on the country's land. In recent years, the US government has abandoned this statesmanlike demeanor. In fact, its policy is not for the benefit of the democratic allied countries.</p>

<h3>Review of the German-Soviet War</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war has been going on for eleven weeks. The German army is advancing on both the north and south routes. In reality, the third offensive in Ukraine is the focus, and in recent days, it has clearly shown signs of decline and stagnation. The struggle on the Dnieper River and near Leningrad has entered a state of seesaw warfare. If Germany wants to try to advance further, it must make great sacrifices and efforts to launch a fourth large-scale offensive. This means that it must add more than a million fresh troops, thousands of aircraft and tanks, and throw them into a more intense bloody battle. Whether Germany can allow itself to do this is certainly a relatively important question; but Hitler, in his entire strategy, must give deep and serious consideration to whether the present timing is appropriate.</p>
<p>Germany's blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union initially adopted a very fierce posture. After the Soviet Union's resolute resistance, it soon showed signs of decline. This was the first offensive. As a result of this period, the Soviet Union retreated on the entire front line, and the main force of the Red Army in front and the rear reinforcements were mobilized and concentrated within the old borders before September 1939. After a short period of stalemate, Germany added fresh troops and launched a second major offensive. The biggest gain for Germany this time was the occupation of Minsk, Smolensk, and other important places in the middle route. However, under unprecedented human and material losses, Germany's offensive soon entered a state of stagnation again. Therefore, in order to thoroughly achieve its war goals, Germany had no choice but to make more sacrifices, which is the third offensive that is now gradually stagnating. This is the largest-scale battle in history! According to Churchill, the military forces used by both sides have totaled six million people, and the official statistics released by the Soviet Union claim that German casualties have reached two million, and the losses of aircraft and tanks have each exceeded five thousand. However, reviewing the course of the battle for these eleven weeks, in addition to occupying some land, Germany's achievements in both strategic and tactical aspects can be said to be completely zero. Several encirclements, intrusions, and pincer movements have failed to repeat the story of the complete capture of the French Maginot Line garrison or the surrender of the entire Belgian army. And even after Odessa was cut off, the Dunkirk-style retreat predicted by the German side has not yet been able to appear. But on the contrary, the Soviet Union's isolated defense of Odessa, the launching of rear guerrilla warfare in the German-occupied areas, the constant maintenance of air superiority, and the victory of local counterattacks are all characteristics of the Soviet Union's resistance, and have given international observers a very deep impression.</p>
<p>The most urgent problem facing the German army now is the coming of winter in the Soviet Union. In the third offensive, the German army took a completely defensive posture in the middle route. In the north, the solid defense of more than a million troops in the Leningrad military district, no matter how much power Germany uses to attack, it is unlikely that it will be seen before winter. So it seems that once winter comes, all large-scale military operations from the Arctic Ocean to the border of Ukraine will have to be temporarily suspended. As for the southern route, if the German army can break through Ukraine before winter and reach the Caucasus area, then it can of course continue to fight in this milder climate and advance towards the Near East and India: otherwise, it can only switch routes and break into Turkey, and then advance towards the Near East. However, taking the German army's advance rate in the past eleven weeks as an example, if Germany wants to break out of Ukraine to the Caucasus and the Near East, in fact, the fourth major offensive is unlikely to achieve its goal, and there must be a fifth, sixth, or even more new attacks. Each time, a million or two million fresh troops, thousands of aircraft and thousands of tanks must be added. This is not allowed by Germany's existing resources, whether in terms of people or materials. Therefore, it is inferred that it may break into Turkey, which has relatively weak resistance. However, in that case, it will make more enemies and force Turkey to join the British and Soviet sides in a joint operation. Of course, it is very obvious that Germany and Italy, after the possible disappearance of the Soviet military structure, must choose between retreating or breaking out. However, retreating is tantamount to accepting defeat and waiting for the British and Soviet counterattacks to arrive: but on the other hand, even on the prospect of a full breakout, there is still no hope of success. The fate of Germany and Italy's failure, after eleven weeks of intense fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union, can be said to be more fully evident.</p>
<p>Then, the focus of the world's attention in the future will only be on two points: first, the Soviet counterattack, and second, the cooperation and counterattack actions of Britain and the United States. In terms of Soviet military strength, whether based on everyone's peacetime estimates or the actual combat process, it has been proven that it is fully capable and prepared to turn from defense to offense. In terms of Britain and the United States, it can also be concluded from their various expressions and measures that their final determination and courage to act in concert with the Soviet Union and defeat the aggressors in one fell swoop are unquestionable. So in reality, these two points are just two sides of the same question. Under the circumstances of a complete British-Soviet military alliance, they will of course wait for the appropriate opportunity to launch a simultaneous attack in one fell swoop. The timing cannot be predicted, of course; but it can be generally predicted that this final action will appear in a coordinated manner, rather than a separate action. Therefore, the recent meeting of British and Soviet forces in Iran, in addition to blocking Germany and Italy from advancing eastward, can also be regarded as the prelude to this common major counteroffensive.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Maintains a Cautious Attitude, Military Says It Will Not Shrink from War if Necessary</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: Acting spokesman of the Information Bureau, Mr. Iwai, said today when receiving foreign news reporters that he was asked about the situation of the Japanese-American negotiations in Washington. The spokesman replied that he thought it would be better to say less at this stage. He was asked whether the speech given by Mr. Mabuchi last night had any relationship with the Japanese government's policy on the Washington talks. The spokesman replied that there was none, because he only spoke from the general position of the Japanese people, and did not specifically refer to the Japanese-American talks. He meant that it would be a mistake to make speculations based on Mr. Mabuchi's remarks. The spokesman continued to refuse to make further comments on the Japanese-American relationship, and said that President Roosevelt had already spoken about it. The Pacific Ocean is too vast to speak lightly. A reporter asked if the negotiations eventually broke down, would there be a serious situation following? The spokesman said that the negotiations are still in progress and cannot be criticized. Moreover, the Japanese government has not yet received a reply to Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt. He was asked if there was any sign that the full text of the Prime Minister's letter would be published in the near future. The spokesman replied that he could not make a decision at this time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd: Colonel Mabuchi, head of the Japanese Army Press Corps, said yesterday in a "East Asia Radio Broadcast" that Japan must break through the ABCD encirclement. If necessary, it will use force to do so. It is foolish to sit and wait for death. Now Japan will make intense diplomatic efforts to overcome the serious crisis that Japan is encountering. But if these efforts fail, it will be forced to use force, regardless of how long the war will last. In the desperate struggle to save our great history, we will not hesitate to fight to the last person and raze our land to ashes. Mr. Mabuchi's speech and the emotions expressed by the Japanese military are in stark contrast to the cautious attitude of Japanese government officials, who are now awaiting the outcome of the compromise between US President Roosevelt and Japanese Prime Minister Konoe.</p>

<h3>Soviet Delegation to the United States Arrives in Alaska, a Total of Forty-Seven People, the Mission They Bear is Temporarily Kept Secret</h3>
<p>United Press, Nome, Alaska, 2nd: Fedotov, Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in the United States, arrived here by plane yesterday to meet with the Soviet representatives, forty-seven in total, who arrived in Nome on Saturday aboard two giant Soviet seaplane bombers. Mr. Fedotov flew from Fairbanks to Nome and immediately met with the Soviet representatives who had arrived shortly before. The Soviet representatives all refused to reveal the purpose of their mission. Mr. Fedotov officially said that the rumor that many of the Soviet representatives were excellent pilots who would drive bombers from the United States to the Soviet Union was nonsense. The so-called Soviet representatives are going to the United States to borrow money to buy military supplies is also inaccurate. The purpose of this trip is temporarily kept secret. The two Soviet bombers are scheduled to depart for Washington today, but Mr. Fedotov refused to reveal whether he will accompany the representatives to Washington, or will return to Washington on a commercial flight.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd: Five Soviet officials have arrived in San Diego, California, and are currently negotiating with United Aircraft Corporation to purchase giant Boeing aircraft. Company officials admitted that several Soviet seaplanes landed in Nome, Alaska yesterday, carrying forty-seven passengers. These aircraft were all purchased from the company in 1937. Residents of Nome have speculated about this matter, saying that most of them are aviators, and some will drive American planes to the Soviet Union, and some are technicians who have come to discuss technical issues. According to previous telegrams, all of these Soviet passengers are aviators, mechanics, and wireless telegraph operators, and the leader is Gromov, all of whom hold diplomatic passports.</p>

<h3>Japan Lodges Another Protest Regarding American Oil Shipments to the Soviet Union, Dissatisfied with the American and Soviet Replies</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 2nd: Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information Bureau, Mr. Kishikawa, announced that the United States and the Soviet Union are not satisfied with Japan's protest against the United States' shipment of supplies to aid the Soviet Union to Vladivostok, so Japan lodged another protest. The spokesman told the press that the United States and the Soviet Union expressed their opinions on Japan's protest, but from Japan's point of view, these opinions are not satisfactory. Japan does not consider this reply to be the final reply, so Japan lodged another protest. Mr. Kishikawa said in reply to questions that the United States' opinion and the Soviet Union's opinion are slightly different. Mr. Kishikawa replied when asked that Japan is concerned about the route taken by the supplies and what the supplies will be used for.</p>

<h3>The Results of the Soviet Counteroffensive: Heavy Casualties for Nazi Troops; German Pincer Movement Blocked by Heavy Rains in the North; Soviets Employ Heavy Tanks in Combat in the Central Sector</h3>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (United Press) – The Supreme Headquarters announced yesterday that as a result of the Soviet Union's fierce attacks on the Nazis along an 1,800-mile front, the number of Nazi wounded has reached millions, constantly being transported to Germany and Nazi-occupied countries. The Soviet side claimed that Soviet forces have launched large-scale counteroffensives, intercepting German troops in various important war zones, and annihilating 1,400 Finnish soldiers in a fierce battle. The announcement further stated that the Red Army's counteroffensives have been aided by heavy rains, turning several parts of the front line into swamps. The German pincer movement against Leningrad is also reportedly stalled. The powerful Soviet forces in the central sector, led by Dutov, seem to have made significant progress in their counteroffensive. Another counteroffensive, led by General Lovtsovitsky along the Smolensk-Moscow highway, has driven back Nazi troops, inflicting thousands of casualties on the Germans. Radio Moscow also reported that since the start of the war, nearly 170 German divisions have been annihilated. German reinforcements from the west have been sent, and "in the two months since the war began, German casualties have exceeded two million."</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – The Eastern European front remains quite intense, as evidenced by both German and Soviet reports. The Soviet High Command has yet to disclose anything, while the German side reports that Soviet forces are launching extensive counteroffensives not only in the central sector but also in the southern sector, downstream of the Dnieper River, and in the northern sector, south of Lake Ilmen. It is reported that Soviet forces have now deployed 50-ton heavy tanks for land combat and are using gunboats along the Dnieper River to harass German bridgeheads. The situation still needs further clarification before a proper assessment can be made. However, it is evident that General Timoshenko and General Budyonny are currently leading fierce counteroffensives to eliminate German attempts to find weaknesses in the central sector. The Dnieper River near Kyiv in the central sector is quite narrow, making it easiest for the Germans to look east towards the Don and Donets River basins. Although the Soviet withdrawal from Vyborg has not been officially confirmed, there are sound military reasons to believe the Soviets have taken this step, shortening their lines of communication and making it easier to defend Leningrad. The rumor that Soviet forces were ordered to withdraw for political rather than military reasons is contradictory in nature and should not be readily believed. The German side also admits that continuous rain south of Lake Ilmen in the main Leningrad war zone is hindering military operations. Therefore, weather is becoming an increasingly important factor in the Soviet defense.</p>
<h3>Red Army in Smolensk Attempts to Annihilate Bock's Forces</h3>
<p>London, 11th (United Press) – The Soviet forces' even fiercer counteroffensives today on the Leningrad, Smolensk, and Gomel fronts indicate that the Soviet forces are adopting a large-scale pincer movement, with the aim not only to isolate Field Marshal Bock's advancing forces from the main German forces but also to protect the flank of General Konev's forces, which are striking from Rogachev towards Bobruisk. The right wing of the Soviet forces, led by Major General Rakovsky, is currently using powerful mechanized units to advance towards Smolensk. The left wing is led by General Konev, whose target is Bobruisk, 160 miles southwest of Smolensk. Another third wing of the Soviet forces is attacking Field Marshal Bock's forces in the Gomel sector. With these three prongs, the Soviet counteroffensive in the central sector seems to have developed into a general counteroffensive, threatening both sides of Field Marshal Bock's forces from Smolensk to Pribyaty. British military experts here believe that this decision is the most significant action the Soviet High Command will take. Although the Soviet side has maintained silence regarding this counteroffensive and has not confirmed British reports, it is understood that this action is proceeding smoothly, with considerable success in at least one operational zone. It is reported that the German troops in that area are retreating in disarray, leaving behind many dead, wounded, and prisoners. It is said that the Soviet forces are repeating and developing their actions from July, aiming to encircle Field Marshal Bock's forces around Gomel. British military experts point out that when the German side began its apparent attempt to advance towards Ukraine, they complained about the dust storms. Their current situation is even worse, as almost all roads are muddy due to heavy rains. The German right flank has softer ground, while the left flank is under attack by the Red Army led by General Konev. Military commentators point out that if the Soviet forces can effectively encircle Pribyaty from Bobruisk and Zhlobin, they could deliver a truly major defeat to the German forces. At the same time, they insist that the German forces are trying to cut off or encircle the Soviet salient. However, according to reports, the initiative seems to be with the Soviet forces. For three weeks, the Soviet forces have been strengthening their counteroffensives, clearly aiming to encircle Field Marshal Bock's forces or at least disperse their strength and clear them out. According to Swedish reports, Soviet forces are already engaged in street fighting in Gomel and it is believed that General Konev's forces have occupied Rogachev and Zhlobin. After these two locations were recaptured by Soviet forces in July, they were never reoccupied by the Germans.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Launch Fierce Attacks on Various Sectors of the Eastern Front; Crimea Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (International News Agency) – According to an announcement by the German official news agency, German aircraft today launched fierce attacks on Soviet supply resources and transportation arteries along the eastern defense line. It is claimed that since the start of the Eastern Front war, this is the first time German aircraft have bombed the Crimean Peninsula. Important targets in western Crimea were fiercely bombed by German Stuka dive bombers. The major Soviet naval base of Sevastopol is located there. German aircraft also fiercely attacked the rear of the Red Army under Marshal Budyonny, which is launching a counteroffensive on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The bombs all hit fortifications, airfields, and railway lines. Berlin openly admits that Soviet forces have launched large-scale counteroffensives on the central and southern fronts but claims that these counteroffensives have all been repelled. The German News Agency also stated that the railway junctions at Gonotop, Kursk, and Bryansk along the Moscow-Kyiv railway have all been completely destroyed by the German Air Force, along with several sections of track and numerous Soviet trains. On Sunday, fifteen Soviet trains on the central front were attacked by German aircraft, with several trains completely destroyed. Regarding the northern front, the news agency also claimed that German forces are intensifying their pincer encirclement of Leningrad, with the German Air Force assisting German forces to great effect.</p>
<h3>Finnish Casualties in This War Against the Soviets Far Heavier Than Last Time</h3>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (Reuters) – TASS, citing a Swedish capital dispatch, reported that, according to a leading Finnish representative visiting the Swedish capital, Finnish casualties in the past ten weeks have been heavier than during the 1939 war against the Soviets. The German side has completely entrusted the heavy burden of operations in the northern sector to Finnish forces but has provided insufficient assistance to the Finnish side in terms of weapons, and the German Air Force has provided little assistance to Finnish ground operations. This is the reason for the extremely heavy Finnish losses, causing deep dissatisfaction among Finnish soldiers towards the German forces. Furthermore, German forces have completely plundered Finland's food supplies, and the Finnish people are now suffering from famine.</p>
<h3>Iran and British-Soviet Representatives Sign Armistice Agreement; Red Army Ordered to Halt Advance; Welcomed Everywhere</h3>
<p>Ankara, 1st (Havas) – According to reliable sources here, British, Soviet, and Iranian representatives have signed a formal armistice agreement in the Iranian capital.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – Although there is still no confirmed news here about the British and Soviet ministers having sought armistice terms from the Iranian government, responsible sources suggest that over the past three days, the British and Soviet ministers in Tehran and the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have reached a compromise on broad principles. It is said that during the meetings between the two Iranian cabinet members and the British and Soviet ministers, much goodwill was expressed. In addition to the broad principles already decided, there are still some details to be agreed upon. Although the nature of these details is still unknown, it can be determined that from now on, Germans will no longer be able to create disputes within Iran for the British, Soviets, or Iranian government. It is now understood that the question of the continued existence of the German embassy in Tehran and how to deal with its staff is one of the outstanding issues to be resolved.</p>
<p>Budapest, 1st (Havas)</p>
<p>The "Mena Pao" here recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in the Iranian capital, stating that all roads from Iran to Turkey are now under the control of the Red Army. Iranian refugees attempting to flee to Turkey have been forced to turn back midway. The Red Army will soon enter the Iranian capital, and the people are living in constant fear. Most residents have fled outside the city, hiding in the mountains and forests. The food problem is also very serious. Most farmers are keeping their surplus grain for their own use and are unwilling to sell it. Shops are closed, and the market is bleak. Rumor has it that some civilians held protests in front of the British and Soviet embassies, protesting the invasion by the British and Soviet forces. However, after the authorities announced martial law, they immediately arrested many military and civilian leaders and informed the people to quickly hand over their weapons to the authorities.</p>
<p>Bilevy, 2nd (TASS) – The Red Army, which has entered Iran, is continuing its advance according to plan. Tanks and infantry are crossing mountains and ridges in excellent spirits and are being welcomed by the Iranians along the way.</p>
<h3>British Times Discusses Diplomacy Towards Iran</h3>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – The Times said in an editorial today that Britain should deal with Iran decisively. In recent years, British diplomacy has been indecisive, allowing Germans to carry out conspiracies in Iran. The Iranian King and his advisors have been manipulated, disregarding the important interests of the Allied countries. The terms of the agreement with the Iranian authorities must no longer be tolerated. Enemy aliens who have not fled to Turkey or Afghanistan should be regarded as prisoners of war and detained, as Nazi secret agents are no less harmful than tanks and aircraft.</p>
<h3>Severe Shortage of Gasoline in Afghanistan</h3>
<p>Quetta, 2nd (Reuters) – According to news from Kandahar, there is a severe shortage of gasoline in Afghanistan. Camels and other animals are now being used to transport goods, and transportation costs have risen sharply. Each car in Kandahar can now only purchase half a gallon of gasoline.</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; Many Civilians Killed and Wounded; He Lian and His Wife Injured, One Son Killed; American Red Cross Committee Members Also Narrowly Escape</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to someone who came here from the South Bank, as a result of the Japanese aircraft bombing the mountains on the south bank of the Yangtze River on Saturday and Sunday, at least 200 people were killed or wounded. He Lian, the head of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and his wife were injured, and their son was killed because the He family lived in the mountains and did not enter the air-raid shelter during the bombing. A bomb hit their house, and He's son was killed instantly. Several members of the American Red Cross Committee also narrowly escaped because the committee was meeting at the Voltbe's residence on Saturday afternoon. Those present included Young, Volt, Hulkotte, and Libby. After the air-raid alarm sounded, everyone decided to enter the shelter to avoid the bombs. As they were walking through the woods, they saw many people hiding in the woods. Soon after, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs and bombed the woods, killing and wounding many Chinese. As the committee members were stepping out of the air-raid shelter, they suddenly saw a large number of people swarm into the shelter, making it impossible for the committee members to enter due to overcrowding. At this time, the second batch of Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky, and a bomb landed about thirty feet away from the committee members. Fortunately, there was a small pile of debris separating them, so they were not injured, which was indeed a narrow escape. At the same time, twenty bombs landed on the Friends Church school and Volt's residence. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Sichuan Province's Fixed-Price Grain Purchase Measures Announced by the Ministry of Food; Grain Price Set at 30 Legal Tender Yuan per Shi; Grain Prices in Various Provinces Are Trending Downward</h3>

The purchasing agencies in various counties and townships should post the names and quantities of households to be purchased on a weekly basis. The fixed prices in other provinces are much lower than in Sichuan Province. For example, Hunan's price is 15 to 30 yuan per shi, and the prices in other provinces vary, but none are as high as Sichuan Province's. The Ministry has also received reports that rice prices in various provinces are trending downward. Zhejiang rice is over 30 yuan per shi, Jiangxi rice is over 40 yuan, Hunan rice is 60 yuan, and Guangdong is only over 90 yuan. It is said that the reasons for the price decline are that, first, the autumn harvest is expected to be bountiful, and second, the government's control has stabilized the psychology of the general public, causing hoarders to worry that they will not be able to sell their goods and scramble to dump them.

<h3>China and the United States Share the Same View on Preventing Aggression and Laying the Foundation for Permanent Peace; Believe That the United States Will Never Abandon Its Traditional Far East Policy; Wang Shijie Praises British Foreign Secretary Eden's Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing – At a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 1st, Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department commented on the US-Japan talks and Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. Minister Wang's remarks are recorded as follows. Minister Wang began by stating that, regarding the US-Japan talks, since Secretary of State Hull has made it clear that they are only of a trial nature and have not reached the negotiation stage, I do not intend to make any more detailed criticisms of the reports in the press, as most of the reports are imaginative speculations. We firmly believe that no matter what stage these talks reach, the United States will never abandon its traditional Far East policy. China and the United States share the same view on preventing aggression and laying the foundation for permanent world peace. This has already been seen in Foreign Minister Guo's expression of praise for the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. Therefore, China and the United States are fully determined to realize this view. Wang continued, saying that the United States' great patience may be exploited by Japan to buy time to complete military preparations in Vietnam and the four northeastern provinces. We must pay close attention to this point. In the past, the policy of patience adopted by democratic countries has been regarded as a sign of weakness by aggressive countries. Therefore, all of the above points must be noted by the Washington authorities. At this point in his talk, Minister Wang praised Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. Foreign Secretary Eden said in his speech, "(These two fundamental principles) are not only the guiding principles for our relationship with Germany after the war, but should also be the guiding principles for all international relations." The Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration also contains this meaning. One of the two major principles is to disarm aggressive countries, as stated in point eight of the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration. (1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central News Agency recently stated that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi's financial opinions were submitted to the Central Bank Committee yesterday. The written opinions also guaranteed that China would assist the democratic countries in preventing aggression and building world peace. It also stated that the government's food plan is proceeding smoothly and that the food situation is improving. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Queen of the Netherlands Delivers Broadcast; Anti-Aggression Group Expanded; Tolls the Death Knell for Hitler</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd. To commemorate her 61st birthday, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands broadcast to the Dutch people worldwide last night, stating that after more than a year of oppression, the strength and will of the Dutch people are stronger and more invincible than ever before. The Netherlands will assume a part of the responsibility in the new world order sought by the British Prime Minister and the American President. Hitler, the great enemy of humanity, wanted to destroy the Netherlands, and although he has used his military force to overwhelm the Dutch people and deprive them of their freedom, and his brutal army has looted extensively, causing the Dutch people to suffer famine, Hitler's attempt to crush the soul of the Dutch people has failed. The Dutch people are brave and unyielding, resolutely resisting, and the Dutch army and merchant sailors have repeatedly achieved successes, which are commendable. The entire Netherlands is determined to fight until victory. The Queen then expressed her respect for the people of other countries and the Dutch people who share the same fate and resist Nazi tyranny, saying that now that our common enemy has turned to inflict his slaughter and looting on the brave Soviet people, the united people are intensifying their resistance and preparing to ring the joyful death knell for the common enemy and his detestable order. This death knell is the harbinger of the people's liberation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd. Dutch Prime Minister Gerbrandy broadcast to the United States last night, describing the suffering of eight million Dutch people under Nazi rule, saying, "Gentlemen, give them new hope. They firmly believe that even as they are being strangled by Hitler, your assistance can still save them in time." The Dutch Prime Minister reiterated the current situation in the Netherlands, saying, "All my main political friends are imprisoned, many university professors are confined in concentration camps, traitors occupy important positions, patriotic people are brutally murdered, torture is used as a tool of governance, prisons are overcrowded, and the tree of freedom planted in the Netherlands centuries ago has had its roots axed. The whole of Europe is now a large prison, and the vicious jailer, Hitler, knows only violence, not justice."</p>

<h3>Preventing Manipulation and Hoarding, Limiting Gasoline Purchases; Providing Gasoline to Cars Based on Previous Needs; Gasoline Reserves Have Not Decreased, No Need to Panic; Three Major American Oil Companies Have Implemented New Supply Systems Separately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Asiatic Petroleum Company and the Mobil Oil Company in this city have limited gasoline supply at their service stations to "normal usage." Mobil and Texaco have also stopped all credit transactions, only accepting cash.</p>
<p>Cash Transactions</p>
<p>According to oil company executives, limiting gasoline supply is aimed at preventing speculators from hoarding and is not due to a decrease in gasoline supply in the city. Texaco, however, has not imposed any restrictions on gasoline sales. Company personnel even stated that there is no need to limit gasoline sales in the short term. The public only needs to pay in cash and can still purchase as much gasoline as their car's fuel tank can hold at Texaco service stations. Mobil stations also only accept cash transactions, and customers can only purchase a "normal" amount of gasoline each month. This amount is calculated based on the number of gallons of gasoline each customer used in previous months. Now, when customers refuel at Mobil stations, the station records their car license plate number and totals the amount of gasoline purchased each day. If the total exceeds their usual consumption, the sale will be refused until the beginning of the next month when they can resume purchasing. The Asiatic Petroleum Company still offers credit to customers who previously purchased gasoline with cash and were registered with Asiatic service stations, allowing them to continue purchasing gasoline with cash.</p>
<p>Average Usage</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether customers pay in cash or on credit, the amount of gasoline they can purchase is limited to the average amount they purchased between April and June of this year. New customers who go to Asiatic service stations to refuel, whether paying in cash or on credit, will be refused. The three oil companies stated that these new regulations will remain in effect until further notice. The Asiatic Petroleum Company's notice to customers stated that "the company will notify customers immediately when its inventory and supply situation improves." However, personnel from Asiatic and the other two companies emphasized that gasoline supply has not decreased significantly and that the restrictions on sales are intended to prevent hoarding and protect car owners who cannot store large quantities of gasoline. Otherwise, car owners will suffer significant losses.</p>
<p>Signs of Hoarding</p>
<p>The reason for these changes is that, because of the current disruption of shipping, it is uncertain when the next shipment of gasoline will arrive. However, there are signs that speculators are attempting to take advantage of the situation to hoard gasoline. Therefore, the new regulations are implemented to prevent hoarding and protect car owners who cannot purchase and store large quantities of gasoline. Otherwise, car owners will suffer significant losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Restrictions</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese authorities, considering the extreme importance of gasoline for national defense, have decided to impose controls. Japanese merchants and residents in Nanjing have already begun implementing these controls. The restriction measures were decided and announced by the Japanese authorities in Nanjing at 3 PM on the 1st: Commercial vehicles are allowed 2 gallons of gasoline per day, commercial trucks are allowed 3 gallons of gasoline, private cars are allowed 1 gallon of gasoline per day, and private trucks are allowed 1 gallon of gasoline. It was also decided to implement a gasoline purchase permit system. Mr. Sugie advocated the slogan "One drop of gasoline, one drop of blood," urging Japanese people to economize as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Today Marks the Second Anniversary of the European War; Foreign Residents Silently Pray for Victory, No Ceremonies Held</h3>
<p>Today marks the second anniversary of the European War. On September 1, 1939, Germany launched an offensive against Poland, ignoring the British ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of German troops from Poland. Britain then officially declared war on Germany on this day two years ago, followed by France's declaration of war. Thus, the European War broke out again, affecting the entire world. Shanghai, as an international city, has maintained a neutral position through the Joint Settlement authorities for two years, expressing deep sympathy to all parties. Today, on the second anniversary of the European War, foreign residents, filled with patriotic sentiments, will only silently pray for the final victory of their home countries and will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. The consulates of Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and other countries will also continue to handle official business as usual.</p>
<h3>Frozen Funds of All Industries Can Be Applied for Release; Funds of All Banks Have Been Fully Released</h3>
<p>Since the United Kingdom and the United States, at the request of the Chinese government, implemented a freeze on Chinese funds, the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect the legitimate trade of Chinese merchants and stabilize public sentiment in Shanghai, agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States to grant the Central Bank the right to release these funds. All funds of Chinese citizens that have been frozen can be requested to be released by the Central Bank. The Ministry has already formulated methods and notified the Central Bank to comply. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that, after being granted the privilege by the United Kingdom and the United States to release frozen Chinese funds, the bank has collected and released the frozen funds of Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange business. Foreign exchange bought and sold in August has already been settled, collected, and processed. Foreign exchange deposits previously received by Chinese commercial banks can also be transferred to the Central Bank with the consent of the depositors or sold to the Central Bank at the prices set by the Ministry: US$9.165 and £3.225. All foreign exchange held by various industries can be deposited into the Central Bank to open new accounts in the original currency or sold to the bank. However, personal checks must be guaranteed by the bank. If various industries need to withdraw foreign exchange in the original currency for legitimate purposes, they should first go through the application procedures according to law. After approval, payment will be made in the original currency. If it is for the purchase of necessities, it must not conflict with the revised regulations on prohibited imports, and the order contract, invoice, and other supporting documents must be submitted for review.</p>
<h3>Limited Export Bills of Exchange Affect the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>But Recent Export Congestion Will Greatly Increase the Supply of Bills</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the demand from merchants in the black market for exchange rates increased. Generally speaking, the impression is that the black market in this city will continue to exist because except for HSBC, which still quotes the legal exchange rate, most other banks in this city buy and sell black market exchange rates. However, the number of export bills of exchange issued is very limited, and the fluctuation of the exchange rate in this city is not proportional to supply and demand. The reason for this may be that. According to speculation, the recent American ships leaving the port carrying a large number of goods should greatly increase the supply of export bills of exchange in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>It is rumored that a Resolution Has Been Reached on Bid-Winning Transactions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that there was a dispute in the Shanghai gold market between the long and short sides regarding the settlement standard for August futures. The shorts insisted on settling according to the HSBC quote stipulated by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, while the longs insisted on settling according to the black market exchange rate. After consultation, a compromise was reached, and the dispute was resolved. However, because the settlement method for the September term has not yet been decided, futures trading remains suspended. Some merchants purchased U.S. dollars at the HSBC quote of 5.3125 yuan, which was quite difficult or even impossible. Whether the black market exchange rate will be used as the settlement standard, or whether the compromise number between the legal and black market exchange rates will be used according to the August term gold settlement method is still under negotiation. Yesterday morning, gold market colleagues continued to meet to decide on a new method for maintaining gold market buying and selling short. It is reported that a resolution was reached yesterday, stipulating an opening price of 9,000 to 9,140 yuan. However, no decision has been made regarding futures trading and the September term settlement method.</p>
<h3>The Henderson Troop Transport Ship Will Arrive Today</h3>
<p>Carrying a Batch of Replacement Troops, Exact Number Unknown</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy transport ship Henderson, carrying military supplies from the U.S. via the naval bases of Honolulu and Guam to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on August 30. It then wired the U.S. Navy authorities here that it would arrive in Shanghai on September 2. According to officials from the U.S. gunboat Smith in Luzon, the ship may arrive today due to delays on the voyage. The ship is carrying a batch of replacement troops to Shanghai to fill positions. The exact number is unknown by Mr. Smith. U.S. Army and Navy attachés withdrawing from Japan will travel on this ship. It is reported that fifty or sixty soldiers from the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment whose service in the East has ended will also depart on the ship.</p>
<h3>Coolie Workers Steal Rice</h3>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday, the French police suddenly dispatched thirty detectives in cars to the front of the Taikoo Wharf warehouse to maintain order. They searched the workers who were carrying rice onto the wharf by name and discovered that over forty workers each had a bag of rice hidden on their bodies. The workers were taken to the Louza Police Station. However, because the Taikoo Company urgently needed to unload cargo, they telegraphed the police station, requesting their release, and work resumed.</p>
<h3>Curfew Passes to Be Exchanged for New Ones</h3>
<p>Exchange Will Begin Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued an announcement stating that all curfew passes issued by the Police Department of the Council will be invalid from October 1 of this year and should be taken to Room 511 of the Police Department to apply for new passes. The fee for each new pass is three yuan, but no photos are required.</p>
<h3>Bowden Going to Singapore to Be Responsible for Unblocking Supply Lines; Singapore Has Become the Activity Center of the British; Bowden's Transfer as Representative Adapts to the Times</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Bowden, the Australian Trade Commissioner to China, will soon leave Shanghai for a new position in Singapore. His title is "Official Representative of Australia" and he has the authority to handle political, commercial, and administrative matters. With Bowden taking on a new position, the Australian Trade Commissioner's Office in China (located in Shanghai) also closed yesterday (the 1st).</p>
<p>Shanghai Office No Longer Necessary</p>
<p>But the main reason for the closure of the office is that Australia is implementing wartime restrictions and has prohibited exports, so the Australian government feels that it is unnecessary to waste the maintenance costs of this office. Considering that Singapore has now become the centralized location for the defense and activities of the British Empire in the Eastern Hemisphere, Bowden's appointment as the official representative and his relocation to Singapore are reasonable, as Bowden is familiar with Far Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Bowden Responsible for Communicating Supply</p>
<p>Any consultations between the Australian and Malayan governments, especially regarding supplies, will be communicated by Bowden in his capacity as the official representative, with the assistance of a commercial secretary and a political official, to handle all diplomatic and commercial matters. According to Bowden yesterday, after the end of the European War, China will purchase a large amount of Australian wool and manufactured goods, and what is particularly important for China will be the import of Australian industrial manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Leaves Shanghai Soon to Assume His New Position</p>
<p>Bowden has a wide circle of friends in Shanghai. He will bid farewell to them within two weeks and set off for Singapore with his wife. He also plans to return to Australia soon to pick up his two daughters for a family reunion.</p>
<p>Bowden arrived in Shanghai on September 6, 1935, to take office as the Australian Trade Commissioner to China. He had previously resided in China for over twenty years and was born in Sydney, Australia in 1886. During World War I, he joined the British Expeditionary Force and fought in France. He was discharged in March 1919 with the rank of Major. He has written two novels that are highly regarded.</p>
<h3>Third Autumn Tide Peak; Highest 12 Feet 86</h3>
<p>According to the prediction of the Dredging Bureau, starting from the 4th (tomorrow) of this month, the third high tide of the autumn flood season of the Huangpu River will last for eight days, with the highest level on the 8th at 12 feet 86, which is higher than the previous two floods. The low-lying roads in this city will inevitably be flooded by the tidal waters.</p>
<h3>Hairdressing Prices Rise Again; But Not Uniformly</h3>
<p>Hairdressing prices have risen again by 20% starting yesterday. However, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the price increase has only been implemented in the central district hairdressers, while the western district Tongfu Road and other places have not implemented the price increase.</p>
<h3>Mr. Dou Lujia, Member of the Municipal Council Music Team Committee, Passed Away</h3>
<p>Dou Lujia, a member of the Music Team Committee and Film Censorship Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been in office for many years. He recently passed away due to illness. Upon receiving the news, the Council deeply mourned the loss of a good man. The Chairman of the Council, Mr. Little, has sent a letter to express his condolences to the Dou family, and the Council will lower its flag to half-mast today to express its grief.</p>
<h3>Requesting a Reduction in Water Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guild of Cooked Water Shops held a meeting of the full committee at 3 PM yesterday at the Ciyu Lane Association Hall on Jiujiang Road to discuss the matter of negotiating preferential water supply. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to elect seven committee members to petition the British and French water companies on Monday, the 8th of this month, requesting approval to reduce water rates or change the calculation method in order to maintain operations together.</p>
<h3>Autumn Winds Rise! Universally Trust and Love Mian Li Sheng Beauty Cream; Great Efficacy; Is the Natural Faith Given to People; Long History; Is the Deep Impression Left in People's Minds</h3>

<h3>Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange: Afternoon Market Resumes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice Trade Still Subject to Prohibition</p>
<p>The Grain and Oilseed Cake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII, as stipulated by the trade association, routinely suspends afternoon trading during the hot summer months. This year, it has been more than two months since the suspension began on June 25th. It ended on August 31st, and because the summer is over, the afternoon trading of the market resumed yesterday. All kinds of trading for the same industry are as before. However, the rice trade in the afternoon is still prohibited and has not been restored. It is hoped that all members of the industry will abide by this and not exceed the norm.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Raises Prices Privately; Shop Owner's Confession is Cunning</h3>
<p>The authorities of the British and French Concessions in this city, because the people's food supply is being monopolized and manipulated, which affects public order, jointly agreed to sell rice shipped to Shanghai at a limited price and posted Chinese and Western price tags in front of each rice shop as a standard. Recently, the Yuanxing Rice Shop at 20 Huanghe Road in the French Concession was found to have raised the price of Saigon rice, which had a limited price of 120 yuan, by 4 yuan. This was discovered by Chinese and Western detectives of the French Concession Police, who took the shop owner, Chuan Yunbo (60 years old, from Tianjin), along with the account books, to the police station. According to Chuan's confession, the Chinese standard limited price was rewritten, but the Western text could not be rewritten, etc. The head detective questioned him about why the account books also showed a price of 124 yuan per stone. Chuan had no answer. The head detective ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

However, no one was injured. Afterwards, the Japanese immediately blockaded the surrounding area and conducted a large-scale search, but the result was fruitless. Unexpectedly, the Japanese announced the day before yesterday that the case had been completely solved, and suspects Quan Senlin, Quan Changsheng, Zhong Weigui, Cai Chongren, and Zhou Yinglong, among others, had been captured. However, the Japanese have not yet announced where these six people were captured. It is also reported that all six people have been executed.</p>

<h3>Food Grain; The Rice Market Does Everything It Can to Reverse the Situation; Frequent Rises and Falls Make it Hard to Bear; Yesterday, the Short Squeeze Once Fell Below the 110 Yuan Mark; Then, Borrowing Rumors to Turn Around Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was weak first and then tight. At the opening of the morning market, it was still wary of the previous day's momentum and remained weak. The actual sales were sluggish, and the scalping business was also quiet. The original buyers and sellers tried to sell as soon as possible, and the prices fell step by step. By midday, high-quality Saigon No. 1 had fallen to 124-125 yuan, secondary rice was only 118 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 108 yuan, bank warehouse short squeeze was 110 yuan, and foreign machinery was 108.5 yuan. After this thorough drop, the wind of covering shorts and the general floating holders recognized that the short squeeze had entered the 110 yuan mark, seemed to be temporarily stable, or on the way to circling, and rose up to absorb at the same time. The market situation gradually saw a reversal from weak to tight. Then, rumors started, foreign exchange shrank, and the hope of peace between the United States and Japan was dashed, all of which were bullish news, which led to the pull-up by large households and the jumping of scalpers. The market rose rapidly. The short squeeze was good at 112.5 yuan. The Yinghua Company was currently at 130.5 yuan to 134.5 yuan, the road was 140 yuan to 141 yuan, Siam No. 2 was at 124.5 yuan to 129.5 yuan, and broken rice was 98 yuan to 19.5 yuan, which was much larger than the previous market. The transaction increased to 17,000-18,000 bags, and the Yinghua Company reached more than 1,000 tons. The situation was good again later.</p>
<p>Although the rice merchants were reversing the situation, a large amount of foreign rice still arrived at the port. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (1st) evening, loaded with 24,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng wheel arrived at the port yesterday morning, also carrying 16,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. Also, the Wallen Foreign Company's Grant wheel decided to ship 2,800 tons of foreign rice directly from Yangon, which is estimated to be more than 28,500 bags, and arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, the three wheels loaded more than 68,500 bags of foreign rice in total. Therefore, no matter how the rice merchants disrupt the market, the fact is there. Even if an accident occurs, the food supply of Shanghai will not be in a panic situation. (Zu)</p>
<p>The continuous arrival of thick and thin Japonica rice has caused the market to weaken, people's hearts are depressed, and the route is lax. The cargo owners are also willing to sell, so the prices of thick and thin Japonica rice have continued to fall by 2-3 yuan. Kainang Port early rice was 157 yuan to 155 yuan, Wuxi original package special Japonica rice was 154 yuan, the general market was 147 yuan, and the secondary was 142-143 yuan. Pudong new Japonica rice also fell by about 2 yuan, opening at 156 yuan, to 55.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice sales market is still not smooth, so the price continues to depreciate by 1-2 yuan. However, the high-quality special goods are quite strong due to the lack of goods in the market and still need to open at 128 yuan, the general high is from 125-126 yuan, and the secondary is to 120 yuan. The supply and demand of glutinous tea is similar and has not had any honor or disgrace, continuing to sell at 114 yuan, and the secondary is to 110 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Vermicelli Fell Below the Mark; It Stood Out Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The continuous fatigue and fall of foreign vermicelli has been too much, which has attracted the attention of new large households. Although new deals have been repeatedly rumored after the price was lowered, the canned vermicelli that was wired at 28 yuan the night before last was withdrawn, so there was no new decision made recently. And the shortage of legal foreign exchange can not be guaranteed. The lack of vermicelli is a fact. The old fleet and warships that have been standing at 34 yuan for a long time are now in short supply and are selling well. Therefore, at the opening of the morning market, large households absorbed in the front, and floating buyers purchased in the back. The transshipment gang also took the opportunity to inquire at a low price. Jinlong brand East Warehouse quoted a price of 30 yuan and 4 jiao, then to 30 yuan and 6 jiao, West Warehouse 30 yuan to 30 yuan and 2 jiao, and the Battery 31 yuan and 8 jiao to 32 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the tight foreign exchange and the rebound of rice and grain, the scalpers became more active in the bullish rumors. The cargo owners were strong, and the customer storages competed to buy. The price has risen more than one yuan. Jinlong East Warehouse from 31 yuan and 5 jiao to 31 yuan and 7 jiao, West Warehouse from 31 yuan and 1 jiao to 5.5 jiao, and the closing price was 31 yuan and 4 jiao. The Battery also reached 32 yuan and 6 jiao. Miscellaneous brands such as banana and cabbage opened at 32 yuan, which was nearly one yuan to 1.57 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 20,000 bags were traded. Only two or three hundred bags of vermicelli at 34 yuan 1-2 jiao were embellished. Wheat bran was also shouted half a yuan higher at the same time. The Japanese bran at 33 yuan was still unwilling to sell smoothly.</p>
<p>Wheat, in the end, is still just a little bit. However, in addition to a few factories in the suburbs, there are also small tickets of three or four hundred bags arriving in Shanghai by rail. The Japanese factory limits the price at 45 yuan, and the local factory is at 48-49 yuan, but yesterday afternoon, the rice flour rebounded, and the handlers took the opportunity to increase the price, unwilling to relax easily.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake; Edible Oil Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market situation, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil futures trading was quite prosperous. Speculators pressed first and then entered, making full use of their ability to change. It was found that at the beginning of the morning market, the selling wind continued strongly, and many households were still struggling to sell, so the market once again dropped sharply by more than ten yuan. Later, rumors suddenly rose, and new buyers repeated their enthusiasm and rose back by six or seven yuan. As a result, it was generally lower than the previous day by five or six yuan. The total market transaction was more than 10,000 dan of Qing oil under the September contract of Dayou Factory, and more than 6,000 barrels of rapeseed oil of Rihua Factory. As for spot trading, it became more sluggish. Raw soybean oil was even controlled by general large households and lacked a formal market.</p>
<h3>Finance Exchange Supply Falls Short</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the HSBC listed price and the small counter prices remained unchanged. The small counter price of the Bank of America was under pressure from import firms, shrinking from $4.875 to $4.75. This indicates that the unofficial British and American exchange market is tightening. The Asian Petroleum Company and a certain company still have large coal settlement amounts. The limited supply from American and other banks is insufficient for distribution. Therefore, the US dollar tightened from $4.84375 to $4.78125, and the British pound also softened to 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence. In the afternoon, Socony Mobil Oil also began rushing to settle, and the market situation became even tighter and difficult to recover. It ultimately closed at the tightest price, with active trading.</p>
<p>Kerosene Settlements Remain High</p>
<p>Since morning, British and Indian currencies in the overseas telegraphic market were stable. American banks and the US exchange market were closed for holiday, and there was no trading. The British pound to Shanghai exchange rate also remained unchanged, and the central listed price was still stable. The opening price of the domestic market was the selling price of banks, with spot British pounds at 2 shillings and 8.875 pence, and US dollars at $4.84375, with the British pound tighter by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's close, and the US dollar also softer by 0.03125. After opening, the market trended towards tightening. The Asian Petroleum Company came to rush to buy spot US dollars at $4.8125. American and other banks had a slight supply for sale at times. The HSBC listed price remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was still levied at 24.50%. Coal settlements continued, also forcing settlements at $4.8125. The Citibank small counter's US dollar softened from $4.875 to $4.75, causing a tightening trend again around 11 o'clock. The noon closing price of the US dollar tightened to $4.78125, and the British pound also tightened to 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence.</p>
<p>The Black Market Becomes Increasingly Tight</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a certain American bank unexpectedly absorbed spot Dutch US dollars at $4.78125, leading to Socony Mobil Oil also rushing to buy at only $4.75 after 3 o'clock. The market situation continued to tighten. Until the 4 o'clock closing, the British pound tightened to 2 shillings and 8.828125 pence, and the US dollar was at $4.75, with the British pound tighter by 0.078125 and the US dollar tighter by 0.125 compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 2nd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. Both British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. Shanghai and Japanese exchange rates were also not quoted, with rates but no market.</p>
<p>Tianjin US Dollar Slightly Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London currency exchange and "United Notes" unofficial market showed no fluctuations. New York telegraphic transfer tightened by 0.0625 to $5.5625. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.5 yuan to 86.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Scattered Buying, Cash Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was still trading in cash on the unofficial market. Trading was thin, and market prices were quite firm, having returned outside the 9,100 yuan mark. Foreign exchange was tight due to the rush buying by oil and coal companies, inevitably affecting sentiment. From early morning, Chen Kee bought 40 taels from He Sheng, and Wing Fung Yue bought 10 taels from De Fu, pushing the price up to 9,100 yuan, 20 yuan higher than the previous day's trading high. Subsequently, the price continued to rise amidst scattered buying. Fuk Hong Wing bought 10 taels each from Wing Shing, 9,120 yuan; De Fu bought 20 taels from Shih Ho, 9,130 yuan; Cheung Wo bought 10 taels each from Fuk Hong Wing, Lap Tai, and Man Fung, at 9,150 yuan. Later, with limited demand and supply, the price was raised by 50 yuan before further transactions occurred. Shun Yuen bought 20 taels from Tai Fung, and Ming Fung bought 20 taels from Wing Fung Yue, with the price rising to 9,200 yuan. After 10:15, Chen Kee resold 30 taels to Fuk Hong Wing for 9,190 yuan; Ming Fung sold 20 taels to De Fu for 9,170 yuan. At noon, there were buyers at 9,180 yuan. In the afternoon, Chung Hing sold 10 taels to Shun Yuen at 9,190 yuan. Later, there were no transactions. The price rose by 110 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily range of 100 yuan. Only two to three hundred taels were traded. The selling price of gold shop's own brand gold was 9,250 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 200 yuan. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises Another 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at jewelry stores was raised by 10 yuan at 10:15 by Ta Tung Hang and Sin Tung Hang, totaling 940 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 50 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Futures Settlement Price Among Experienced Traders</p>
<p>Last night at 5 o'clock, the United Exchange Association convened a meeting of 40 brokers to discuss the new settlement price for gold futures in the future. The Association proposed using eight factors, including cash, British gold pounds, British gold bullion, US gold pounds, US gold notes, British exchange, US exchange, and Hong Kong notes, to determine the new settlement price through a weighted average. A valuation committee consisting of five members from the Association and two representatives each from gold shops, silver shops, securities firms, and money exchange businesses, totaling thirteen members, would be formed to evaluate and determine the settlement price at the end of each month for clearing outstanding positions at the end of the month. The meeting will continue today for further discussion. If approved by one party, there is hope for new trading to begin tomorrow (Thursday).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Many Bullish Factors Send Yarn Prices Soaring Straight Up, "Double Horse" Breaks Through 700 Yuan Mark... Keen Short Covering in Yarn Futures</h3>
<p>After fluctuating for two days, the yarn market rebounded sharply yesterday, mainly because rumors spread that the prospects for peace between the US and Japan had disappeared again. Those who had been selling off, realizing their misjudgment, were eager to cover their positions. As a result, the market sentiment shifted, and buying interest intensified. The fundamental issue is still the abundance of speculative capital. Accounts with ample financial resources absorb supply and remain inactive. It is mainly speculators who are rolling in and out. When sellers flock to the market, prices plummet. Once short sellers profit and attempt to buy back, and momentum strengthens, the upward pressure intensifies. Conversely, a slight easing leads to a sharp decline. According to market rumors, some are scouring the market for cotton cloth, and it is believed that foreign exchange for imported cotton is difficult to obtain, causing market sentiment to fluctuate and prices to rise accordingly. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,795 yuan, and the low was 1,682 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange price rose sharply, with cotton yarn up 40-50 yuan compared to the previous day, and cotton cloth up 1.78 yuan. Driven by this, "Double Horse" yarn was initially traded at 1,696 yuan, then gradually rose to 1,707 yuan. The closing price was 1,706 yuan, and the off-market price was 1,709 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning market for "Double Horse" yarn opened high, with the initial price at 1,682 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,687 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange price rising, market sentiment continued to strengthen. It fluctuated between 1,687 and 1,688 yuan for quite some time. However, sales to customers were poor, and Hong Kong merchants were slow to take delivery, so the situation was flat. At the same time, trading was also not active. Once it reached 1,688 yuan, with the exchange closing price continuing to rise, market sentiment was boosted, and short sellers were disappointed and covered their positions. The market gradually rose to 1,694 yuan, and continued to strengthen after closing. Statistics show that 6,610 bales were traded in the morning. The quantities purchased by each group are as follows: Hong Kong 20, Tong Hang 6,500, statistics 6,610.</p>
<p>Although news regarding the "Double Horse" yarn futures market remains uncertain, the trend is gradually upward. In recent days, competition between bulls and bears has often led to selling at highs and buying at lows, causing market prices to fluctuate wildly. This morning, the market opened with higher factory orders and optimistic sentiment, leading to short covering and aggressive buying by bulls. As a result, the opening price for September delivery was 1,602 yuan, up 6 yuan; October delivery was 1,603.0 yuan, also up 12.5 yuan; November delivery was 1,649 yuan, up 6 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange gradually rising, speculators and bulls took advantage of the situation to absorb supply, creating a tight market. 9,330 bales were traded in the morning. In the afternoon, market sentiment became even stronger, with the near-term contract reaching 1,600 yuan, October delivery rising to 1,628 yuan, and November delivery rising to 1,667 yuan. There was only a slight pullback in the morning, and the afternoon rally was due to a lack of significant selling, resulting in minimal correction. Although the underlying factor was the lack of US cotton trading, the rise in the exchange was the main reason for attracting buyers. As a result, September delivery closed at 1,615 yuan, October delivery at 1,643 yuan, and November delivery at 1,666.5 yuan, each rising by over 20 yuan. A total of 17,909 bales were traded throughout the day, a decrease of 2,780 bales from the previous day. Furthermore, the outstanding balance for the three months ending on the 1st was 23,620 bales, with 7,150 bales for September delivery, 9,390 bales for October delivery, and 7,080 bales for November delivery. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded below (net prices):</p>
<h3>Concerns that Cotton Funds May Not Obtain Foreign Exchange, Imported Cotton Prevented, Spot Cotton Already Raising Domestic Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quite firm. However, due to the impact of difficult approval procedures for cotton fund applications, fixed-price transactions remain sluggish. At the same time, a small number of cotton firms are also shifting their attention to the acquisition of spot cotton. If foreign cotton is ordered without being able to obtain standard foreign exchange, there will be many twists and turns in the future, and the delivery date is far off, with no business certainty. Wouldn't it be better to abandon that and purchase spot cotton, which yields more benefits? With cotton yarn trending upward, and all foreign cotton sources suddenly facing insurmountable difficulties, the spot cotton market will undoubtedly become prosperous. 一</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for the American Labor Day holiday.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, followed by a fall due to profit-taking by bulls. However, the market subsequently rose sharply again due to widespread buying. As a result, the closing prices yesterday rose by about 10 rupees each. Furthermore, it is predicted that the opening market today will be flat, similar to the closing price.</p>
<p>Also, the Indian cotton statistics from September 1st of last year to August 30th of this year are recorded below (each bale is 400 pounds):</p>
<p>Total listed in Bombay: 3,200,000 bales</p>
<p>Remaining in stock: 1,286,000 bales</p>
<p>Total listed in Karachi: 1,270,000 bales</p>
<p>Total exported: 1,359,000 bales</p>
<p>Remaining in stock: 139,000 bales</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation has not been as strong as the yarn market recently. The reason is that the raw material cost for 20-count yarn is said to have exceeded the yarn price, resulting in thin profits for factories. Therefore, factories are observing the situation with regard to raw materials. However, 23-count and 42-count yarns still have substantial profits.</p>
<p>Peng Chia Po No. 514: 10 lots delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Next, Peng Chia Po No. 480: 100 lots delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Hangzhou Cotton No. 285: 300 bales also</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton No. 280: 1,000 bales also</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton Bales No. 30: New Yu, 500 bales delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Slightly Rebounds, Footing Still Considered Firm</h3>
<p>The government bond market turned bearish yesterday, but the footing is still considered firm. Large bullish accounts have not let go and have continued to add to their positions. This phenomenon is due to a temporary surge in selling pressure. Excessive selling may still help the bullish side in the future. The timing for a peaceful resolution is not yet ripe. "Only those who endure hardship can rise above others." It is best to patiently wait for daylight. Yesterday morning, Xin Fu continued to buy, and Le Mao, Heng Kang, Shun Tai, and Hong Da also had demand. However, Da Hua had a large amount of selling, and Da Zhong, Yi Tai, Ding Kang, and Zhong Yi, among others, were selling off. Class C bonds opened at 1.20 yuan and closed at 0.04 yuan, slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, Le Mao and Hong Da continued to buy. De Chang, He Feng, Yi Zhong, and No. 25 were also actively buying. The lowest price seen was 70.03 yuan, as Run Li, Run De, Lian He, Ding Kang, and Yi Ji sold off. As a result of the competition between buying and selling, the prices rebounded slightly by 0.025 yuan to 0.095 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 2.22 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 47.10 yuan.</p>
<p>Although trading at the Stock Exchange Association is brisk, the activity has decreased compared to before. Prices are very stable, not far from the general level. The potential of both industrial stocks and rubber stocks still seems quite good.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rebound Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded sharply due to the tightening of the black market exchange rate and rumors that supply would be suspended. The dissipation of the "Afu" sentiment was also a contributing factor. The spot price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar set by the association was 125.50 yuan for August imports, 126.10 yuan, 128.50 yuan in the afternoon, 129.50 yuan, 128.80 yuan, 125.30 yuan for July, 128.50 yuan, 125 yuan for June, 128 yuan, all up about 4 yuan, 124 yuan for April, up 1 yuan, Dutch red (KD mark) 120 yuan, NT mark 114 yuan, 110 yuan, all up 1 yuan, Hong Kong coarse white 120 yuan to 122 yuan, up 3 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark and HX remained at their original prices. The futures price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar for September 10th delivery was 125.40 yuan, 125.70 yuan, 127.90 yuan, 128.50 yuan in the afternoon, 131 yuan, 128.20 yuan, up 3.20 yuan, 126 yuan for September 20th, 127.90 yuan, 129 yuan, 130.70 yuan in the afternoon, 129.70 yuan, 129.60 yuan, up 3.50 yuan, totaling over 32,000 bales traded in futures and over 9,000 bales in spot. Grade 1 ice sugar was 163 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar was 165 yuan, up 8 yuan. 1,070 bales of sugar were imported on the 2nd, transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Dealers Gradually Recognize Justice, Beginning to Sell Spot and Not Issue Delivery Orders</h3>
<p>Regarding the white coal market, general hoarders believe that prices will rise again next month and are holding back from selling. However, the result is quite different. As the exchange market lengthens and supply continues, dealers have begun to supply to the minority of spot sellers in the industry, only selling for immediate delivery and not issuing warehouse receipts to prevent hoarding. This is indeed a timely way to stabilize the market. All dealers should not only supply the industry with limited spot goods but also directly supply users' needs with a considerable amount of coal at any time. In this way, foreign companies can enjoy their profits as usual, users will not have to worry about a lack of coal, and they will not be oppressed by the manipulations of the bureau. If all foreign companies only supply large hoarders and small and large dealers, they are simply acting in collusion with the hoarders. While "wanting to eat lamb brains, they do not care about the lamb's life," they are turning black coal into blood and not considering that engaging in too much injustice will lead to their own downfall. Yesterday, with dealers paying more attention to justice and supplying spot goods without issuing warehouse receipts, hoarders had no way to exert their skills, so market sentiment stabilized and the market atmosphere calmed down. The local door and store fronts previously scoured the black market for warehouse receipts, with high costs. Briquette costs 540 yuan per ton, and extracted blocks cost 560 yuan, delivered to customers, including transportation costs, it is said.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Red Rice Up 300 Yuan in Ten Days</h3>
<p>Red rice has not arrived for a long time, and market inventory is dwindling day by day. Therefore, the market has been gradually rising recently, reaching unprecedented high prices. Even considering the market prices in the past ten days, the increase has been nearly 300 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3>Education News Rescuing Shanghai, Ningbo, and Shaoxing Students Who Have Lost Their Schooling, Zhejiang Provincial Temporary Middle School Set to Open, First, Second, and Third Division School Sites Already Found, Fourth Division May Be Entrusted to Yingda for Co-operation</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) The case of Zhejiang Province establishing a temporary middle school to accommodate students withdrawing from Shanghai and the Ningbo-Shaoxing war zones has been reported previously. Now, the school's recent situation is of great concern to all parties. This reporter made a special visit to Director Xu of the Department of Education, who informed me of the preparation situation of the temporary middle school as follows: The temporary middle school was originally scheduled to offer senior high school, junior high school, simplified normal school, senior sericulture, junior sericulture vocational courses, senior industrial vocational courses, and senior commercial vocational courses, accommodating a large number of students. If managed centrally, there would not only be no suitable school buildings, but also difficulties in procuring meals. After sending personnel to various places to survey school sites, it was decided to manage them separately by location and division. The planned budget was approved by the Ministry of Education in late July, with the tasks of surveying and requisitioning school sites, the heads of each division presiding over the opening of grades and classes, and examining and registering students, handling distribution, etc., all not being determined in a short period of time. Therefore, the start of the school term must still be in September. The school name is set as Zhejiang Provincial Temporary Middle School, divided into several divisions, depending on the actual needs. The first division is located in Chongren, and Pan Xijiu, the former director of training at Shaoxing Provincial Middle School, has been appointed as the director, opening senior high school, junior high school, simplified normal school, and other classes. The second division is located in Ganlin, Sheng County, and Miao Zutong, the former principal of the sericulture vocational school, has been appointed as the director, opening senior and junior sericulture vocational courses and other classes. This division does not accept ordinary middle school students. The third division is located in Xiuxi Township, Changshan, and Sun Zhengrong, the appointed director, has gone there to prepare. Senior and junior high school and other classes will be opened. The third division requires the purchase of all equipment, making preparation more difficult. Therefore, the estimated opening of school will be slightly later. The fourth division plans to open senior industrial vocational courses, but the school site is still under consideration due to the relationship between equipment and student practice. In the future, it may be entrusted to Yingda for co-operation. As for the senior commercial vocational courses, because there are not many commercial students currently registered, opening classes seems uneconomical. It is planned to review the applications and distribute them to existing commercial schools for study. Student registration has been extended to the 15th of this month due to the obstruction of news from various places and the isolation of news within the occupied areas, in order to ensure universal knowledge and avoid anyone being left out. Therefore, the original publication date has also been extended accordingly. However, registration letters are still coming in. Statistics are now being compiled, and examinations and distributions are being handled. A list will be published in batches in the newspaper in the coming days. Students requesting relief will be reviewed and decided by each division.</p>
<h3>Ding Shan Art Exhibition Closing</h3>
<p>Chen Dieye's Ding Shan Painting Exhibition closed on Sunday. Despite the continuous rain and wind, viewers came in droves, not minding the hardship. Sunday happened to be a sunny day, so the Da Xin Hall was very crowded. According to people on site, this hall had the fewest and most exquisite exhibits and the highest achievements, with this exhibit being unanimously considered the best. It is a pity that Mr. Ding Shan was ill and unable to attend the seven-day art exhibition, which was a regret for those who wished to see his style but could not.</p>
<h3>Guilin Establishes a Chinese Medicine School to Cultivate Traditional Chinese Medicine Talents</h3>

For all preparatory matters, the provincial government has now appointed Liu Huining, Wei Laiqiang, Liao Shouluan, Xie Shaotang, Wang Shirong, Chen Yunsheng, etc., as members of the preparatory committee, designating Wei Laiqiang as the chairman of the committee, and has issued an official seal, immediately organizing the preparatory committee to proceed.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Qiguang Middle School: Qiguang Middle School, approved by the Ministry of Education, was newly established by Shanghai-based Jiangsu natives Gu Nanqun and Zhou Youwen, etc. Gu is the chairman of the board, and Zhou is the principal. Recently, the Zhejiang-Ningbo Building at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Zhejiang Road has been found as a temporary school building, enrolling 50 new students each in the first grade of the senior high school general studies department and normal school department, and in the first, second, and third grades of the junior high school department. The number of applicants has been very large recently. It is heard that the school has specially set up a night school department for the benefit of working young people to continue their studies. The curriculum is exactly the same as that of the day school. At the same time, in order to benefit poor students, many free places are set up in each grade.</p>

<h3>International Mini-Soccer Match, China United to Play Portugal Today, All Soccer Stars to Appear, 6 PM at Poorhouse Institute</h3>
<p>In the William Shield mini-soccer competition, China United and Portugal are scheduled to meet at 6 PM today at the Jiaozhou Road Poorhouse Institute.

<h3>Yeh Yuan-lung Reprimands a Thief</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper carried a report titled "Chongqing University President Yeh Yuan-lung Reprimands a Thief," which recounted how a thief, upon seeing Yeh's simple and honest appearance, gladly accepted Yeh's worn-out fox fur coat and left. Reading this, we feel that even a thief knows not to take advantage of a poor scholar, perhaps there is honor even among thieves?</p>
<p>Given today's high cost of living, it is not surprising that scholars are poor, it is even inevitable. If a university president like Yeh has only the clothes on his back and no savings, and professors are already becoming "teach-lean," one can only imagine the poverty of elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>However, a scholar's poverty is precisely what makes him valuable. A gentleman is concerned with principle, not poverty. Mr. Yeh bears the heavy responsibility of educating talents and setting an example of hard work and perseverance for national revival, and establishing a just and selfless path for young students. Mr. Yeh can be said to be content with poverty and finding joy in the pursuit of knowledge!</p>
<p>The perseverance of scholars, understanding principles without calculating gains, poverty is their touchstone, and poverty is not to be feared.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Jinnan Cottage Jottings</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Ullambana Festival (2)</p>
<p>"Yankou" was originally a term for hungry ghosts. Legend says that the Venerable Ananda was sitting alone in a quiet room one night when he saw a hungry ghost named Yankou, whose body was thin and emaciated, with a throat as thin as a needle, and flames coming out of its mouth. The ghost told Ananda: "In three days, your life will end, and you will be reborn as a hungry ghost." Ananda was afraid and asked for a way to avoid suffering. The ghost said: "Tomorrow, give each of us hundreds of thousands of hungry ghosts and Brahmins a bushel of food, and make offerings to the Three Treasures for me, then you will increase your lifespan and I will be reborn in heaven." Ananda told the Buddha about this, and the Buddha then spoke the Dharani, saying that reciting this Dharani would make countless hundreds of thousands of food offerings sufficient. This is the origin of the Yoga Flame Mouth ritual. Therefore, blowing conch shells and performing mantra hand gestures in the Flame Mouth ritual (that is, the chief seat uses the fingers of both hands to make various gestures) all follow the rituals of esoteric Buddhism. It is not surprising that those who study esoteric Buddhism must give food offerings in their daily practice. Now, regardless of whether it is the Ullambana Festival or the Yoga Flame Mouth ritual, they are all for transcending hungry ghosts, so the emphasis is on giving food offerings. Whether hungry ghosts exist and whether giving food offerings is correct are religious matters and another question. However, today's Flame Mouth rituals only focus on the pleasant sounds of silk, bamboo, bells, and drums, and the dazzling lights of ritual implements, and almost completely lose the original intention of saving hungry ghosts. Instead of transcending them, it is simply a riot of ghosts. The malpractices of the end of the world are truly laughable!</p>
<p>Legend has it that after monks are summoned to various ghost realms, they must recite mantras to dispel ghosts, and there is a so-called ghost-dispelling mantra, which is actually the heart mantra of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the six-character mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum." In the Journey to the West, it is said that Tang Sanzang's tight headband mantra can make the magically powerful Sun Wukong fall to the ground, roll around, and beg for mercy in agony, which is also this six-character mantra. Now, every time there is a Flame Mouth ritual, there must be a paper-扎 青面神 offered, with City Gods and Earth Gods standing beside it, or as portraits. This 青面神 is an incarnation of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, called the Ghost King, because according to Buddhism, Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva not only saves people, but also saves ghosts, so he makes various incarnations.</p>
<h3>Words Need Not Be Many</h3>

<p>Twelve Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>"If nothing had happened to Wu Meiying when she went back half a month ago, then something unexpected must have happened to her on the way into the city a few days ago. This letter must be opened for her." After thinking about it for a moment, Warden Wang opened the letter without hesitation.</p>
<p>The content of the letter was not long, but it kept her sitting blankly for more than a quarter of an hour in her old bifocal glasses.</p>
<p>"Her father said that he hadn't seen a letter from her for a long time, which clearly means that she went missing when she went back." Having this kind of thing happen, Warden Wang of course had to report to Principal Fang: "That day was the fourteenth day of the first month. Her family suddenly sent someone to look for her to go back, saying that her father had been beaten by someone. Wu Meiying was also very careful. Before getting up to leave, she specially came to discuss it with me, saying that the person who came seemed a bit suspicious. Unfortunately, that day I..."</p>
<p>Warden Wang spoke smoothly, almost blurting out the fact that she was drunk that day, but fortunately she realized it early and corrected herself in time.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, that day I had a bit of a headache and didn't have the energy to think carefully for her, so I hurriedly approved her leave and let her go back. Now it seems that it might really be a scam!" As she spoke, Warden Wang couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p>
<p>Principal Fang lowered his head and pondered for a long time. (201)</p>
<h3>How Fluorescent Lamps Came About</h3>
<p>— Yi Dao</p>
<p>Since Edison invented the electric light, fluorescent lamps can be said to be a new contribution to science. The first widespread use of fluorescent lamps was in 1938, when the New York and San Francisco expositions were held. The venues were decorated with tens of millions of brightly colored fluorescent torches, so even at night, the venues were as bright as day. However, at the time, tourists did not know that they were fluorescent and thought they were just ordinary electric torch designs. It was not until recently that fluorescent lamps became popular everywhere, and the number of fluorescent lamps installed in various countries around the world is increasing by the thousands every day.</p>
<p>The Invention of Fluorescent Lamps</p>
<p>Since Sir Humphry Davy invented the arc lamp, and Edison improved it into the carbon filament lamp, and then various scientists improved it into the tungsten filament lamp, although it has been improved by major scientists over the past fifty years, its biggest drawback is still that it wastes a lot of electricity. For example, in a tungsten filament bulb, the electricity consumed by heat accounts for 90% of the total. Therefore, the invention of fluorescent lamps can be said to be the realization of engineers' ideals over the years.</p>
<p>The principle of fluorescence has been known for a long time, but although many scientists have experimented many times, there have still been no satisfactory results. Until a few years ago, George Inman of General Electric invented a powder that, when applied to the inner wall of a glass tube filled with mercury vapor, would emit a very pleasing fluorescent light from the tube after electricity was applied to both ends of the glass tube. After this lamp was improved by Western Electric and Hygrade Sylvania, it became the current fluorescent lamp.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Fluorescent Lamps</p>
<p>The biggest characteristic of fluorescent lamps is that they are highly efficient and energy-saving. They provide twice as much illumination as electric lamps, while the amount of heat generated is half that of electric lamps. The second characteristic is that the light from fluorescent lamps is cooler and softer than the light from electric lamps, so working under fluorescent lamps will not damage the eyes. The third characteristic is that fluorescent lamps can emit light of various colors without having to paint the lamp tube.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: For a comparison of fluorescent lamps and ordinary lamps, see Mr. Zhong Han's article on August 11 of this publication.</p>

<h3>The Nickel Coin Tide on the Sea</h3>
<p>— A Mang</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In the early autumn of 1941, a tide of nickel coins swept through Shanghai from the markets to the small alleys.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a barren place, with no ore veins or miners, but there are also ore veins and miners. In the past, scrap copper and iron were worth copper coins, so even the copper door rings of my humble house were taken as ore veins and dug away, losing a grand appearance. Thinking about it now, it is very sad.</p>
<p>Now the value of nickel has risen to the clouds because it is used as a raw material for airplanes. Therefore, nickel coins are qualified to ascend to heaven and have risen sharply - Shanghai's nickel mine is planted in the private rooms of wives and young ladies, and in the toy boxes of children, because the 收羅家 forgot about this little thing, and now they just realized it was profitable...</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Look, Mr. Yin is particularly polite to his yellow-faced wife today: "Amao's mother, take out your privately accumulated little nickel coins from the 25th year of the Republic of China, and I'll go with you to exchange them for colorful banknotes!"</p>
<p>Amao's mother pouted: "Uh, you won't even let me play with the little nickel coins; what's so happy about exchanging them for banknotes? Aren't nickel coins money too? Five cents, ten cents, it's not worth much!"</p>
<p>Mr. Yin laughed: "This is what you call a woman, you don't understand the market outside. Do you know how valuable nickel coins are now? A five-cent coin can be exchanged for six or seven 大洋!"</p>
<p>Amao's mother was shocked: "Oh, so expensive? A few days ago, Amao played with five or six of them and dropped them somewhere."</p>
<p>Mr. Yin seemed to have dropped six 法幣, and quickly asked: "Where did they fall? Where? Find them quickly, find them quickly!"</p>
<p>Amao's mother hesitated: "It's nothing more than the corners of the wall."</p>
<p>Mr. Yin took off his long gown and squatted down to look for them - digging for a nickel mine, the shoe box rolled on the ground, raising a layer of dust.</p>

<p>Nickel coins are rising even more: five cents for eight or nine yuan, ten cents for seven yuan, twenty cents for five yuan...</p>
<p>Hardware stores started a side business: "Also accepting nickel coins," a small sign hung.</p>
<p>The peddlers who collect tin foil ash stretched their throats or whispered, sticking their heads in: "I have nickel coins!" - They mostly charge one or two yuan less than the "market price," and they earn this little bit. This new side business highlights the dullness of their main business..."</p>
<p>In front of the money shops, some refuse to accept them, but others secretly do these transactions: nickel coins flow in, banknotes flow out, flowing, flowing - invisibly flowing.</p>
<p>For Others and for Oneself, Service is Business-Oriented, Xin Yuan</p>
<p>Everyone can do their best and concentrate when doing their own business. However, when serving others, they always do things perfunctorily, holding the principle of "doing the same job every day." You should know that any occupation, directly or indirectly, is related to the happiness and misfortune of the public. Therefore, although you are only serving a certain private person on the surface, if you handle it carelessly, not only will everyone suffer from your harm, but you yourself will also suffer great disadvantages. As for the employer's loss, it is the smallest.</p>
<p>Because you yourself have developed the habit of being perfunctory and careless, when you want to do any kind of business in the future, on the one hand, you lack an active spirit, and on the other hand, you lack experience. Therefore, whether you serve others or do your own business, you will only be eliminated. Therefore, when we are "working for others," we must treat it as our own business, work hard, concentrate, and do our best to do it well, and strive for perfection.</p>
<p>For example, the American steel king Carnegie, he described his successful experience as follows:</p>
<p>"When I was ten years old and working as a yarn-winding apprentice in a yarn factory, I was determined to be the best yarn-winding apprentice in the world. I worked hard and did well. After doing it for a while, people discovered me and felt that it was a pity for a child like me to always be called a yarn-winding apprentice, so I was hired as a postman.</p>
<p>After becoming a postman, I again made up my mind to be an outstanding postman. After doing this for some time, I was appreciated and introduced to the telegraph office as a telegraph operator. Afterwards, I used the same method to achieve today's success."</p>
<p>The reason why Luth and Carnegie were able to do things so well was entirely because they regarded their duties as their own business. And if a person can achieve "service business-oriented," then isn't the greatest benefit still to themselves!</p>

<h3>Preface to Jian Lan Melody</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Xushe is a rising Kunqu Opera troupe, which I have introduced in a special article in the third issue of Wenlin Monthly. A few days ago, Xushe held its first gathering, singing songs and admiring Jianlan orchids at Ms. Xia Xunru's residence. As soon as I entered the door, I smelled the fragrant and rich scent of the king of flowers. In addition, there were many song friends, it was truly like "entering a room full of芝蘭." The song stage, dining table, and floor were all filled with Jianlan bonsai, each pot with several orchids of different shapes blooming on the dense orchid leaves. Examining Mrs. Xia's repertoire, it turned out to be more than forty excerpts, and she could recite each one fluently, singing with accurate words and melody, truly worthy of being an old opera singer. Two stage photos, one of disassembling a book and one of putting on makeup, were hung on the wall, extremely vivid and natural.</p>
<p>The opening performance was Xunru and Ms. Yin Junong's "Qin Tiao," followed by Yan Rui and my "Small Feast," Miss Pan and Yin Zhenxian's "Good Date," Ms. Cai Shuliu's "Thinking of the Mundane," and my "Picking Up the Painting." Later, Yin Zhenyi (he and Zhenxian seem to be brothers, and both are doctors, but they are not of the same clan) also came, and he sang an excerpt from "Welcoming and Crying."</p>
<p>The most rare thing was that Yu Zhenfei also arrived at this time and sang "Sweeping Flowers," singing clearly and loudly, and full of charm. Paired with Miss Pan's graceful and melodious singing, it was truly a wonderful combination of red flowers and green leaves. At this time, everyone listened quietly, the world was silent, and everyone was fascinated, and their hearts and spleens were refreshed.</p>
<p>Following was Junong's "Calling the Painting." Next up were Mrs. Zhou Shukang and Yao Zhangyun's "Sending Teasing" and Wang Yi's "Folding the Willow Branch." These three people's songs are usually not easy to hear, and Miss Wang had just returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The climax was Zhenyi and Ms. Li Xitong and Shuliu singing a duet from "Wandering in the Garden and Startled by a Dream." Zhenyi sang Chunxiang, covering his face with a handkerchief, then taking a fan, squeezing his voice and singing affectedly, which was the most hilarious. The listeners all laughed at him, so everyone was happy. Even more wonderful was the final act. Zhao Zeng and Xie Junong played a tiger. Feeling pain in his arm, he cried out "哇呀呀" and the whole hall cheered. Finally, he stepped heavily on the ground to show that he was dead (how he came up with it). The listeners laughed and clapped, and even Jianlan seemed to crack a smile!</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Early Release the Caged Bird from Its Confines</p>
<p>Tian Hongyu went to Jiangnan to sweep tombs and happened to meet Yuanyuan. He thought that he, with his white hair and her red face, would form a pair of lovebirds. In the future, their amorous history would be widely spread, and their elegant charm would flow. He would not have wasted his life. Therefore, he did not hesitate to use ten斛 of pearls to forcibly carry her back, breaking up other people's marriage. Who knew that he was not blessed to enjoy this beauty. It was his daughter, the Imperial Concubine Tian, who took the lead and wanted to offer Yuanyuan to Emperor Chongzhen, hoping to relieve the emperor's worries. Of course, he did not dare not send Yuanyuan to the palace. However, he was very unwilling in his heart. Since he sent Yuanyuan into the palace, he returned to his residence, sitting alone in his study, feeling depressed. He originally had a troupe of female musicians in his residence, with sandalwood clappers, silver zithers, phoenix sheng, and dragon flutes, everything. Although Tian Hongyu was a relative of the imperial family, he indulged in music and debauchery like this, showing extravagance and lasciviousness, which shows the laxity and corruption of the Ming Dynasty courtiers. In the evening, he drank wine in the Hongqing Pavilion and ordered the female musicians to serve wine on the side. Many powder-white and dai-green beauties came to the pavilion to play wonderful music, the strings and pipes were clamorous, and the sound was靡靡. On weekdays, Tian Hongyu still felt that he was enjoying the silk and bamboo, drunk and dancing, and had a bit of interest, but tonight he felt that it added to his sorrow, and his heart could not help but be tied to Yuanyuan. Thinking that tonight, the emperor has obtained this beauty who can overthrow a country, no different from Emperor Tang Ming and Yang Yuhuan, the hibiscus tent is warm, the spring night is short, and they live together, how happy? But the old man is suffering, working for others, looking at plums to quench thirst, isn't it a waste of effort? However, thinking of his daughter's good intentions, he felt that this move was right and proper, and he could not be selfish. I hope that the emperor will favor Yuanyuan and not forget my daughter, so that the emperor's heart will be joyful, diligent in national affairs, and revive this country with enemies on all sides, and pacify the bandits, then we who climb dragons and attach phoenixes can also enjoy wealth for a long time. Alas! Tian Hongyu thought like this, but who knew that the affairs of the world are often unexpected? (158)</p>

<h3>Small Records of Liyuan Figures</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi Made Biography, Zhang Yizhang Made Picture</p>
<p>(36) Shang Heyu</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou's Wusheng surpassed all others, and it is only once in ancient and modern times. However, specifically in terms of martial arts, those who do not seek perfection in the overall beauty, then Shang Heyu is also enough to compete with him. Common people call Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting together, but Zhenting's recklessness is far inferior to Heyu. Abandoning Heyu and taking Zhenting is a common view, not a fair theory. Heyu is older than Xiaolou, but Xiaolou cannot match his energy. Recently, at the age of seventy, his "双鑠" is still not careless, and "跥泥" is still standing still, as stable as Mount Tai. Those who see him are awed as if they are facing a god. This is something that Xiaolou could not do in his later years. However, Heyu only wins people with his fighting skills. As for "扮相," "嗓音," and "唱白," "表情," etc., all of them are far from Xiaolou and cannot be compared. Therefore, Xiaolou is a figure of the ages in Liyuan, and Heyu is only the best choice at the time. Although Heyu has unique skills, he has never been successful in his life. In the past, when he came to Shanghai, his signboard was even second to Yang Ruiting. His later years were slightly better, but he was still depressed and subordinated to others, never able to gallop and vent his anger. Therefore, he sold all his belongings to show his determination to retire and return to his hometown to farm. (Heyu is extremely frugal, and has accumulated a lot of wealth. He has a lot of land in Baoding.) He will never put on makeup and go on stage again to compete for a day's fame with latecomers. When he died, his ambition arose again, and he reorganized the troupe to perform again. An old man of seventy years old is so unwilling to be lonely. His spirit is strong. Isn't he a living god? However, although public opinion praises him, the prosperity of the sales seats is still difficult to achieve as he originally wished. This is also enough to show the change in public sentiment!</p>
