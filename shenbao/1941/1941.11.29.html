<h3>美日兩國外交關係　進入極端微妙階段　在經濟制裁下將逐漸惡化　羅斯福赴溫泉談判已擱淺</h3>
<p>合衆社二十八日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨與來栖、野村會談四十五分鐘、外間頃方傳說東京對美國關於太平洋和平之强硬政策聲明之答覆、或將爲在數天內進攻泰國、日本是否原意　續談判、無何表示、此次談判擱淺、顯因美國突然態度强硬、並宣布其政策所致、來栖步出白宮時、記者紛紛提出質問、渠搖首略現怒意、渠謂、對所傳日本即將進攻泰國並無所悉、消　黨通界稱、美國强硬聲明、實際上結束遠東問題解決之希望、赫爾經數度會議後由其退讓之口氣一變而爲强硬重申美國基本外交政策之原則、大部份人士相信、此種惡化必將拖延、而無尖銳或突然之破裂、衆信美日關係在經濟制裁繼續中將遂漸惡化、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日華盛頓電　來栖、野村昨午後於白宮會議後出吿新聞記者、彼等巳與羅斯福總統作甚友好之談話、或問以解決美日問題之談判將否復開、來栖以渠未接返國之命令爲答、但不說明將否於比後數日內再晤國務卿赫爾、記者又問星期三日所接之美國提議有無繼續談判之基礎、野村答稱、渠未奉東京訓令、故不能置答、此間消息靈通方面認爲、昨日之會議、在現有之討論階段中、有特殊重要性、赫爾昨於日大使等退出後、仍留白宮與總統談一刻鐘、或詢其擬否再晤日代表、赫爾答稱、渠與日代表未有約定云、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日紐約電　日方使節雖仍留華盛頓、惟羅斯福總統巳定今日赴溫泉休假、大約星期三日返京、紐約時報今日社論會指出美·日談話並未破裂、但謂兩政府之基本地位，距離頗遠、美國爲目身之安全利益計、誓對抵抗侵略之各國加以援助、並將繼續援華云、該報最後警吿日本、勿以爲美國目前因在大西洋方面負有更大之義務、遂即無力在太平洋行動云、　紐約二十七日電　華府消息靈通及有資格人士、大多認爲前後巳歷十二日之美·日談話、隨時有宣吿破裂之可能、此就太平洋情勢而論、對一般民主國家之前途尤其對於中國之前途、巳逐漸發生良好影響、若干方面所懷憂慮及悲觀態度、亦逐漸廓淸、美政府已決定堅守國務卿赫爾過去闡明之基本原則、認爲太平洋一切問題、欲求商定最後解決辦法、悉應以此爲基礎、美國各報今日多以顯著地位刊載赫爾昨向來栖提出文件之訊、其所用標題大多謂「美國巳拒絕接受太平洋上之慕尼黑」、來栖今日訪晤美總統一舉、未能改善美·日間之緊張關係、來栖雖會否認擬於短期間返日之說、但衆信來栖恐即擬回國、觀察家稱、赫爾對來栖提出文件一舉、乃美國方面之最後一步動作、第二步動作應由日方爲之云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十八日華盛頓電　太平洋和戰關頭所繫之美、日談話聞巳瀕於決裂、觀察家稱、東京答覆美國星期三晚之提案時、可以得到答案、彼等之悲觀情緒、因外傳東京對美國之强硬政策聲明或將爲于數日內對泰國之攻擊、更見增高、羅斯福總統諒係對日本使節以明白之措辭重新聞明美國之立塲、據悉羅斯福總統强調聲言、美國將不由遠東之基本政策後退、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日華盛頓　　此間一般意見雖認日本局勢極爲嚴重、惟仍有若干觀察家相信、日本現正施其恫嚇故技、今日會有參議員二人抱此見解、一爲參院外委會主席民主黨參議員康納萊、謂局勢雖達沸點、但將不致沸騰、另一爲參院外委會前主席民主黨參議員喬治、謂日軍向泰境之調動、以大半爲恫嚇性質云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十八日加里電　日駐秘魯大使坂本昨飛赴華盛頓與來栖、野村有所會商、</p>
<p>日利用沉寂時期布置出擊新陣地</p>
<p>路透社二十八日新加坡電　美、日談話巳吿停頓之消息、業使遠東全部入於期待狀態、此間官方雖拒絕對未來發展作任何揣測、惟皆信種種事件或將發生、據若干人士指稱、中國與其他地方之日軍、數週中雖顯明無甚活動、惟須知此並非日軍未從事作行動的準備之謂、且有種種證據、可見日軍正利用此沉寂時期布置新陣地、俾一旦東京方面發出信號、即可迅速出擊也、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日倫敦電　華府之　·日談話、現顯接近最後階段、英國報紙登載、有限制的協定瞬將締結、以及談判現巳失敗之種種矛盾消息、惟據消息靈通人士稱、迄今所接華府談話之消息、純出於猜測、而尙未能獲得談話進展之任何徵象、或迅獲結果之希望、亦未能估計談話之範圍、惟日使所提任何建議、美國必先加以極客愼之研究、然後始能考慮寬弛目前所施之經濟壓力、</p>
<p>合業社一十八日倫敦電　此間昨日對華盛頓之報吿謂、美國巳決心放棄試行與日和解之說、均表示懷疑的歡迎、雖然華盛頓有此悲觀之報吿、但此間對成立一三月協定以維持太平洋之現狀、而美·日間之基本不合點、尙待再行試探、仍表有可能和解之希望、觀察家以爲中國大使胡適傳士及駐華盛頓之經濟代表宋子文對羅斯福總統之請求、不致使政府態度突然改變、至相傳美國已願解除對日本一部份之經濟制裁、非官方批評家顯取兩種態度、　獲得日方之一協定後再作有理由之讓步、　恐日本於衝破經濟制栽之設立原則後、更擴大其達成反制裁之原意，</p>
<h3>日內閣昨開常會討論美牒文內容</h3>
<p>路透社二十八日東京電　今晨內閣常會中、外相東鄉會以赫爾致日特使之公文內容報告政府各員、於是內閣即討論日·美談話問題、開會前、首相曾接見外務省東亞局長陸軍省軍務局長、海軍省海軍事務局長與陸軍次官、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日東京電　日·美爭案、顯繫於赫爾致日使之公文、是否爲美國之對案、而需日本答覆、抑美國務卿是否已對自四月間進行至今之談話作最後答覆一問題、今晨情報局發言人岸偉一聲稱、華盛頓之日·美談話、今仍在進行中、赫爾致日特使之公文、東京始於昨夜收到、刻正作密切研究、發言人拒絕批評文中之內容、並拒絕聲明日本是否或在何時作覆、發言人述及赫爾與中。英·澳荷代表所開之會議、謂美國進行此項談話、乃為自愼計、蓋美·日談判當然涉及遠東其他列强之利益、故不得不有此舉也、今日獲賣新聞之社論重申日本決心實行首相東條臚舉之諸原則、繼謂、美國如仍堅持絕對之原則、而不顧日本和平解決太平洋問題之條件、則頗少或絕無餘地使一目前日·美談話獲有成功之結局、談話之成敗、將視依據日本覆文續作之談話爲決定、岸偉一又會舉各報所持任何暫時協定將予拒絕之主張吿新聞訪員、謂此係爲日本之民聲、政府必予重視、</p>

<h3>亟待解決之的問題</h3>
<p>與食物同樣嚴重威脅人生者莫如住：此一問題亦與戰事發生以俱來：而今物價巳有敉平之望，惟房租小費頂費挖費押租之重重誅求，敲骨吸髓，迄無有制止之說。新房屋承租條件之嚴酷無論巳，願者來，不願者去，此業主與經租帳房昂頭之得意語也。舊房客加租之痛苦日以深；有託洋商出面加租攆逐房客。有用流痞强暴手段，摺伏房客，而不敢不加。亦有雇流浪之人，挾其特殊背景，侮虐良善之房客，飲泣吞聲，屈從其奢望。或託言房屋全部出售，分幢出賣，收回自用，逼令房客遷走。亦有不顧一切，將舊房屋拆卸，趕走老房客，重建新房屋，以便索取高租金及其他異乎尋常之小費。甚至以加租不遂，斷水斷電，使房客有米難炊，黑暗難行，而不顧火盜之爲患。彼輩豈念今日所以加諸人者，焉知異日不以人之加諸我；更不思天網恢恢，疏而不漏，如囤積居奇輩，報應之來，固有不可思議者。夫以巍巍大厦，索以高貴賃金，尙不爲過。至里弄房屋，中小建築，所稅居者，大都爲生活尋常薪工食力之輩；擁有房地產者得其應得之利潤斯可矣；而必欲與投機囤積爭一日之長，是以房地產爲囤積，而以租賃相操縱，同是危害及於大衆生活，而不與管制日用必需品同樣處置，非但無以折服一般囤貨之心，亦且無以自解於公衆。何况制止房租暴漲，不乏先例，日用必需，又豈限於食品，故取締房東所加之威脅敲索，解除房客之無窮痛苦，實爲當前應有之義也。</p>
<p>然而不良之二房東，壓迫三房客，罪有浮於大房東。橫加租金之外，旣有所謂押租，亦有所謂外費。一客堂樓索租八九十元，外費千數百元。亦有統廂房一間，月租一百六十元，小費三千元，押租四千四百元，如是黑心之二房東，固屬罕見，而類於此者，更僕難數。因是頗有藉租房以作投機之分子，不惜用盡種種方法，覓取房屋，而以之轉租轉頂於人，坐獲大利。此外如二房東之對待三房客，有限制用水也，電燈也，一家之人數也，小孩之多寡也，出入之繁簡也，烹庖之地點也，起居之拘束也，種種苛例，無非欲以束縛分租之人。己則旣將房屋前後上下，晒台灶披，儘其可能，用作分租。不問一屋之內，人口多寡，光錢黑暗，空氣惡獨，疾病傳染，進出障礙。更不念災患之來，作何應付；但求進益浩大，仍享其使用上之最大權利，此直接打擊三房客，憑空增加巨額房租，間接以摧殘公衆健康，危及地方安全，實爲民生之蟊賊，社會之蠹虫。若不加以嚴厲制裁，縱使大房東顧全房客困苦，不爲己甚，而一般之居住問題，仍無解決之希望。</p>
<p>房屋旣投機化至如楚地步，而何以新造房屋，分幢租售，不嫌其多，仍有受主。分租租費，勒索萬分，高貴異常，猶不患無承租。是則旣願承受其苛酷之條件，卽不能謂爲房東無饜之誅求。殊不知此有供必有求，其中大有苦樂不勻，非可一概論。如房屋分租，不嫌其租金小費之昂，蓋爲房客時有借故被攆走，不能無棲止，移徙頻繁，忍痛相就，安問租金小費之橫漲，而分租乃不患無賃居，此其一。凡稍涉足內地者，咸知行旅艱苦，種種不便，別有一般况味在心頭，遂使上海人口疏散，猶無實現之望，居住問題，迄難解決，此其二。上海投機居積之風盛，誘使內地之人，向上海集中，反有增加居住問題之困難，此其三。至房地產出售，不論價格如何飛漲，仍有受主者，則爲（一）內地避滬之殷富，飽受大二房東之壓迫，寗願出重價，覓新居，以消胸頭之恨，而得安居之樂。（二）港滬間之匯率懸殊，以港幣購滬產，猶爲最上算之事，而房地產爲其投資兼有投機之目標。（三）被逐來滬之猶太人，聯絡上海之舊侶，施展其買賣房地產股票之慣技，以逐厚利。（四）一般視法幣不値錢者，除囤貨以外，復起搜羅房地產；不論其爲滬上產業，卽蘇杭無常之房地產，亦受其垂靑。（五）最近一二年中新起之暴富太多，儻來之物，用之於房地產，無論價格昂貴，猶不失爲保產之道，安富之樂，故趨之若騖。執是以觀，其屬於一般的，無非爲房束之俎上肉。其屬於特殊的，非可以爲房租之準繩，而爲暴富特有之現象。俎上肉，良可痛，不有改善，何以對民衆。</p>
<p>顧何以改善一般之租賃現狀歟！曰甚難！民衆之呼籲，輿論所表示，不聞有何反應。蓋其焦點所在，豈僅以擁有房地產者長袖善舞，聲氣廣通，抑亦所謂納稅人者，非卽爲房地產之納稅人耶！則由此而產生之代表，果以社會公衆福利爲重，然豈能忘情於其所代表階級之利益歟！且房地產租價之提高，間接亦可增加公家之收益，際此薪津頻增，不無資以相挹注，故欲抑低房地租，使公家减收入，事亦兩難。因之大房東可放任，二房東何可獨加取締。雖然；此非爲秉公服務者言，蓋一旦處於公務地位，自應公爾忘私，從公衆福利着想，則不能置房租問題於腦後。何况改善房租現狀，亦決不至侵犯房東合法之利益，大衆所望，去其泰甚，遏其無饜之誅求耳！且兩租界當局旣可憑藉進口協會，以控制零售物價，獨不能用房地產業公會以抑平房價？今日上海之房地產，其大部分（一）爲洋商所擁有；（二）爲華商所有，多由洋商掛號經租；（三）銀行信託及房地產業經租處所有；集合此三部分代表，解決房租問題，不難迎刃而解。大房東之房租有辦法，則二房東之婪索，亦不難從嚴取締。至取締之要：（一）房租以某一時期爲標準，此後不得再加。夫以某一時期房租爲標準，則房東已有之利益，絕無損傷。惟所謂時期也者，或以最近幾年之平均數，或爲本年某一期之租金，此其間頗有出入，要以公允爲原則。（二）除押租（多至三月爲限）外，一切小費雜費概行禁絕，違者追繳所收之費發還原出費人外，並課以同額之罰金。（三）頂費以實際所出之裝修費及押租押櫃各費爲限。（四）二房束應將房租收據，公開於房客；共分租取費辦法，應以房租捐稅電費（或有水費）及應有之繕修雜費或其所可有之利潤合計之，從其出租房間之地位大小優劣比例分配定之，如有逾越租費之和百分之若干以上者，房客雖已承租於前，得舉發取締於後。（五）房客如無拖欠房租，或房東並無收回自用之必要，及房客無其他不法不良行爲者，不得藉詞解除租約。（六）非有正當之事由，不得加租；卽加租亦須陳報租界當局經召集承租人調查後，方予核准。（七）假使因一般房租之調整或限制，確有損及租界應有之稅收時，不妨以此所少收之數，平均增加房捐，以資彌補。（八）其以房屋轉放出頂爲投機牟利之工具者，得懲罰之。</p>
<p>凡上所言，非欲促房地產業之衰落，而欲維持業主房東房客間相互之利益，以維護民生，此固目前應有之措施，未可視爲緩圖也。</p>

<h3>荷印的華僑小販</h3>
<p>— 吳緘三</p>
<p>在荷印的鄕村間，常常可以看到車着一箱雜貨的中國人，汗珠掛滿一臉，東西南北地嘶聲叫賣着。馬來人喊他們為Kolontong，或者是Tjina　Mindering。——這便是所謂「華僑小販」。</p>
<p>這些華僑小販，他們听叫賣的大抵是康價的紗籠·刺繡·古董·皮革·綫類以及各種食品。他們把各種商品裝在一架配着輪子的大貨櫥裏，推着向各鄕各村去兜售。這對於離市塲旣賒遙，而又分不得身的馬來主婦們，是很便利的。無怪華僑小販一到，她們便就有如會到戀人似地，興高采烈地老遠便羣相招手，親親熱熱地高聲喊了起來：</p>
<p>「Baba（註一）！馬理信你（註二）呀！」</p>
<p>雖即用現款購買，也得比市塲裹昂貴了許多；如果是掛欠，利息史是重得駭人；（每一盾每天利錢四仙，一年即須荷幣十四盾四鈁）。但她們往往却搶得個空」。因此這班華僑小販，獲利頗巨；比如一年裏賣出原價一千八百盾的商品，連賺錢和掛欠的利息算上去，即可得六七千盾。他們大都又兼設「小錢莊」，以供給土人們的借貸，利息是每盾每日兩仙，每月即須六鈁。因為肯茹勞飲苦，又兼之「生財有道」，他們在海外的生活，過得也還不惡；至少比之流浪歐洲的「靑田小販」們，幸福得多了。</p>
<p>不過這種小販的行業，也很難做。土人們往往羣相賴債，稍一催索，則恃强糾衆毆打；因而每年雖可獲利至四五千盾，但常常却被賴去兩三千盾的債，一文也收不到。又因為窮鄕僻壤間，天高皇帝遠，每有宵小之徒肆行刦掠；華僑小販們就常常還到道個災殃，不獨財物一空，弄得赤貧如洗；而且常常竟被刀戳槍擊而死。</p>
<p>這些小販，大抵是閩·粵一帶的僑胞。此外還有一些山東人，販賣「山東綢」之類的布疋；以及一些紹與人，販賣着所謂「上海雜貨」。因為荷印的入口稅（每人上岸時須交與一百五十盾），限定六閱月後即行沒收；所以他們約在荷印販賣了四五個月，便往英屬一轉再來。為了衣食，奔走天涯，就如勞燕一樣；春來秋去。每回一瞧到他們那一張張給熱帶的炎陽晒得焦黑了的臉龐，和聽到那像牛一樣地喘着的大氣，我便不由得要想起一句舊詩——</p>
<p>「偷活人間亦苦辛」！</p>
<p>（註一）馬來人稱人曰「Baba」，意即「阿哥」。</p>
<p>（註二）馬來語：「馬理」即「來」，「信你」即「這裏」</p>

<h3>出生入死的科學家</h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>直到如今許多人還以為所謂科學家者便是把終身消磨在實騐室中，不斷的分析試管中的物質，製造難聞的化學混合物的人。但是現代的科學家並不如此，他們也是出生入死，如同前綫上的兵士一樣。</p>
<p>就拿毒物學專家白魯思懷特敎授來說吧，在一件毒斃案中，他懷疑乾酪，但是經過三番五次的化騐都不能證明乾酪是有毒的；於是他自己開始不斷的吃各種樣子的乾酪，結果他終於吃到一種有毒的乾酪，他自然病得很厲害，不過他並不在意，因為他巳經證實了他的案子。</p>
<p>不僅嘗毒而且還有人讓一種非洲的毒蠅來叮自已呢。這種毒蠅傳染一種可怕的睡眠病，息者頭痛欲睡，形容憔悴，終至不起。這便是非洲的一位醫生，他的助手，和一位土著。他們都沒有染睡眼病，所以這位醫生先注射一種豚鼠苗，再讓毒蠅來叮自己。因為他要試騐目己的新療法，一種叫做吉曼寗（Germanin）的藥，靈不靈。幸而他的藥很靈，他痊愈了，但這個險可冒得多大呀！</p>
<p>你曾經想過一個在暴風雪中凍死的人是不是痛苦嗎？有一個人能回答你道問題，能吿訴你在極冷中凍死者的感覺，他是劍橋的科學家，巴爾克勞夫特爵士。在他實騐室的特備冷室中，他做了一個目凍的實騐。</p>
<p>起初他覺得非常的痛苦。但是在某一刹間，冷的感覺消失了，接着而來的是一種可愛的溫暖的感覺，他不是曝於日光中，他是曝於寒冷中。他的神經中樞已經停止了搏鬬，他的血液已回到了皮膚中，……他的溫度巳急速地降低，於是他已徘徊在死亡的邊際了。這是多英勇的實騐呢！</p>
<p>有些地質學家為了硏究火山，竟冒險深入火山口中去觀察，他們觀察的火山是活火山，隨時都有生命的危險。可是為了科學，他們把生死置諸度外。</p>

<h3>飛行訓練車</h3>
<p>— 張喬</p>
<p>美國空軍中之數千航空訓練員在試飛之時，可於陸上行之，而無須凌空駕雲。這種陸上飛行車是萊特飛行塲發明的，現已在巴克第爾飛行塲試用。車中之座位，控制桿，舵機踏板，及其他機件，皆與飛機中相似。前有點二二口徑槍一桿。車中之座位是浮吊着的，所以其傾側，向上向下之搖動與飛機在空中飛行時完全類似，因之在陸上飛行訓練車中可以得到同樣效果之訓練。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>這個人的脾氣倒眞是又急又躁，話說到這裏，便立刻站起身來，托着梅寶遞給他的一一茶，馬上解開那包傷藥，就要親自給秋海棠灌下去：虧得梅實靈巧，忙搶上來接了過去，同時陪着滿臉的笑說：</p>
<p>「是傷藥嗎？張先生，呑傷藥是要用酒的，不然怕沒有功效吧？」</p>
<p>「啊！不錯，我倒是昏啦！」張銀財的半截石像似的身軀，這才重復縮了回來。「那末停一刻讓這位姑娘侍候你服下去吧！」</p>
<p>這一來，秋海棠的一顆心才又略略安定了些。</p>
<p>「老吳，這兒我有二十塊錢，不算什麽，祇當給你買一些下飯吃，好讓你的身子容易恢復起來！」說着，他就把四張很敝舊的鈔票望秋海棠的枕角裏塞了進去。</p>
<p>「啊！張老板，—不能讓你…化錢……」。</p>
<p>「這有什麽能不能呢？我姓張的隨便怎樣不講理，將來也決不向你討還半個子，你放心收着吧！」他隨手取起那板茶來喝了一大口，便打方櫈上站了起來，做出馬上要走的樣子。</p>
<p>「梅實，快向張老…板磕…一個…頭吧…！」秋海棠竭力提隊了聲音說。</p>
<p>梅寶便深深地向張銀財鞠了一個躬，又着實向他稱謝了幾句。（二七五）</p>

<h3>皇后大戲院不日完成　決計與米高梅合作　聖誕前後正式開慕</h3>
<p>今天有個消息，足為萬千影迷報導的，便是巍峨堂皇的皇后大戲院，業已落成，而即將開幕了。皇后大戲院，院址在處洽卿路三馬路口，一品香右壁，面臨跑馬廳，交通最便。而在轉角上，裝設燈座，晚間如果從國際飯店那邊望去，則光芒萬丈，把跑馬廳照耀得如同白畫一般。</p>
<p>據說，皇后於去年動工，動工之後，首先為西片公司所囑目，幕後爭相進行與戲院合作，因此戲院當局，決然加資興建，務求於開慕時，予滬上人士以一切的嶄新的感覺。在兩年之間。資本從一百五十萬元堆至四百萬元。</p>
<p>昨據該院負責人士宜稱，該戲院已決定戲映首輪西片，且巳決定米高梅權威新片。至於開幕新片，及有無與其他西片公司訂約。則尙未至發表時期云。美琪大戲院開幕前，盛傳該院將映米高梅出品，嗣後此訊被證為不確，初不料米稿梅片乃歸皇后所有。聞皇后大華兩家，決與米高梅實行合作，而皇后除米高梅又擁有其他公司巨片，殆亦為顯然之事。</p>
<p>最後消息。皇后大戲院巳决定於聖誕節前後開幕了。</p>
<h3>我偷偷地吿訴你些攝電影的魔術　（下）</h3>
<p>— 前笨</p>
<p>賊黨搶刦，以物塞口，扮事主的演員，也毫不用其叫苦連天，他反有好東西吃呵，並非騙你，這些東西都是軟糖製造的。在銀幕上糖菓還做許多奇怪的東西呢。不論何時，演員咬的一本書，一個球，都是用糖製造的。動物是特別歡喜糖菓的，所以如果你看見狗貓，猴子，熊咬窗簾，皮帶，鞋帶和其他種種東西，你可以斷定他們咬的是糖菓造的東西！</p>
<p>菓醬和朱古力常用作傷口流出的血，而醃豬肉則用來代替人類的膚肉。在銀幕上當某人要受火烙之刑時，一塊醃豬肉就成在石棉上面，而石棉則貼在膚肉上。這樣，燒紅的鐵就可以眞個烙花「膚肉上」，結果發出吱吱的響聲，逼真萬分，但其實某人的　肉絲毫不損，烙的是醃的豬肉而已。</p>
<p>那最好笑的，還是食物的代用品。最　明的例子就是冰淇淋，因為冰淇淋在攝影燈光的熱度下，溶解很快，所以馬鈴薯粉就代替它。上面這些秘密在銀幕上，一些也看不出有什麽異樣，然而一說穿，也就不怎樣希罕了。</p>
<h3>「職業婦女」觀後</h3>
<p>— 楊濬</p>
<p>看了中旅在天宮演出的職業婦女，覺得牠確能反映出現社會職業婦女內心的痛苦，我認為道戲一定可以給予觀衆很大的啓示。目前一般職業婦女，她們和社會腐惡的勢力掙扎，為了爭取女性獨立自由平等的地位，不惜犧牲自己的幸福，準備替未來的女同胞們開闢一條光明的大道；我們可以從這戲裏看出她們的勞績，張鳳來就是其中的代表之一。她受盡了統稅局長方維德的欺侮，他千方百計要達到追求她的目的，然而却被她堅決地拒絕了。她憑着堅强的意志，正確的信念，站在自己的本位上，替被壓迫的職業婦女努力奮</p>
<p>其他劇中人物都能刻劃出特殊的個性，故事穿挿得很好，演出的技巧是不用說了，從開始到終　能够緊緊地抓住觀衆的心，控制觀衆的情緒，全劇可算無懈可擊。鄭乃麗所飾的賣花女，天眞活潑，趙怒是中旅各導演，他飾王道本，態度嚴正兼帶幽默，很合身份。邵華飾張進中，也可說達到成熟境界，他又能從小動作中表現出他的性格。吳純眞的方夫人，表露一個果敢的女性，頗有可取。廖凡的方局長，演出頗够動人，他思想的頑固，行為的　預，做得流漓盡致，他頒佈了凡結婚女子一律停用的命令，局裏許多女職員失了業，張鳳來隱瞞着她結過婚的事實，得以保全位置，她年輕美麗，得着局長的垂靑；局長為要維持他正人君子和道學的假面具，又禁止女兒的自由戀愛，在另一方面他却毫不知恥地，做着許多卑劣不堪的勾當，種種醜態終於被揭露出來。後來他竟動用公款，做投機生意，被李專昌查出事實的眞相。自命為維護仁義道德的偽君子，到了這時終免不了要受良心的　責了，這活　地寫出目　投機商的奸刁與無恥。這不像戲，這簡直是現社會醜惡縮影</p>
<p>復旦大學平劇社名票梁儷倩小姐，（見上圖）是荀派花旦名票，她有嫵媚的扮相，天生的金嗓，和細膩的內心表情，今日在天蟾舞台為正言報教育貨金義演拿手　作「花田錯」，演出定下美滿。</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十九章　黃昏胡騎塵滿城</p>
<p>許靖也躍馬趕來，大叫「柳賢弟窮寇莫追，我等且接應大軍渡河。」柳隱英眉峯一縐，對許靖說道：「小弟不留神，腿上巳中得一箭。」許靖一驚道：「可妨事嗎？」柳隱英道：「大致沒有重傷。」許靖遂先下了雕鞍，扶他下馬，便在草地上坐了。左右將火炬在旁照着。許靖低下頭去，只見柳隱英的左腿卜挿着一枝雕翎，幸虧中的尙淺，其勢巳偏，故沒有深入。許靖對柳隱英說道：「柳賢弟快把這箭拔去了再說。」柳隱英點點頭。許靖俯身代他將戰袍撩起，柳隱英解去帶子，自己伸手摸着了箭，咬着牙齒，望外一拔，丟在地上。便見有鮮血流出來了。柳隱英又把褲子慢慢捲起，露出雪白粉嫩的肉。許靖瞧着這粉腿，活像是女子的，不由心中一動。便說「傷在那裏？」枊隱英將褲捲在傷處，祇見有一個很小的傷口，不住的淌出血來。許靖便用劍在他自己衣襟上割下一塊布，代柳隱英紮　了創痕。對他說道：「聽說白顯忠將軍那裏有上好的金創良藥，待我明天去向他要了來，代賢弟敷上，即可全愈。」柳隱英道：「多謝靖哥的美意。幸筋骨沒有受損，總算是不幸中的大幸。我也還敬那厮一鏢，把他打跌下馬。若小是小弟巳受傷時，早巳趕上前去將那厮縛住了。」（二三一）</p>

<h3>Economic Conference Carefully Discusses, Strictly Implements Price Control Measures, Strengthens Inspection Efforts to Thoroughly Stabilize Prices, Uses Political Power in Addition to Economic Power</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Yesterday's economic conference decided to accelerate the implementation of price control measures by relevant authorities, strengthen investigation and inspection work, in order to achieve the goal of thoroughly stabilizing prices as soon as possible. The conference also announced the original work implementation outline, which includes four parts: Division of powers, stipulating that the Economic Conference is the highest national price control and monopoly agency, under which the Ministry of Food is responsible for food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for industrial and mining products, and daily necessities, the Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for wages, and the Ministry of Transportation and the Transportation Control Bureau are responsible for freight rates. In addition, the Four Banks Joint Office is responsible for planning price stabilization funds. Price investigation: The conference will first investigate the market price of clothing, food, fuel, daily necessities and industrial raw materials in Chongqing, as well as the supply in Chongqing, and then investigate the prices in the production and assembly areas of these goods to determine the parity price. This work must also be extended to other important cities. Implementation of management: According to the above investigation, if the Economic Conference predicts that a certain item will rise in price, it will immediately notify the competent authority to take preventive measures. If it has already risen, it will propose urgent and effective methods to curb it. The method is mainly to use economic power, and if it is not enough, political power can be used. Business adjustment: Price control agencies should coordinate the source of materials, widely set up supply stations, and assist cooperatives to universally supply parity goods, and should entrust stores to act as purchasing and sales agents to expand the circulation circle. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Many proposals regarding prices were raised at this National Political Council meeting. Although no specific measures were proposed, many illegal situations were exposed. What is more noteworthy is the people's mentality reflected in the discussion. When the Economic Conference held a plenary meeting in the Executive Yuan today, Chairman Chiang himself presided over the meeting. The results of the discussion have not yet been announced, but it is said that a decision was made to strictly implement various price control measures and prohibitions on hoarding and speculation. Among them, special attention will be paid to strictly prohibiting banks from buying and selling goods or engaging in such activities in the name of commercial firms. If civil servants are found to have such behavior, they will be severely punished. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

When asked about the results, the bishop only said that the Chinese military authorities are still investigating the matter. From this, it can be seen that the expelled missionaries are still staying in China. It is said that when the bishop was in Changsha, he discussed the continued operation of the Catholic churches there. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Vietnam Sets Deadline for Road Construction, Completion Scheduled Within Two Months as a Transportation Line for Attacking Yunnan</h3>
<p>Guilin. It is heard that the Japanese military authorities in Vietnam are now rushing to build a road connecting to the Yunnan border, with a deadline of two months for completion.

It is also heard that the Japanese army is now increasing the defenses on the Vietnamese-Guangxi border between Zhennanguan and Longzhou. According to reports, on November 19, patrol teams on the Sino-Vietnamese border near Zhennanguan exchanged gunfire, but it only lasted for a moment.

<h3>Points for Attention Regarding Government Ministries' Work Reports Raised by the National Political Council, Paying Tribute to the Commander-in-Chief and All Officers and Soldiers on Behalf of the People</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The various ministries of the government submitted detailed reports to this National Political Council. In addition to written reports, the heads of the various ministries also gave oral reports to the conference. After accepting the reports, the National Political Council submitted them to various groups for review and attached detailed opinions to the conference for approval before submitting them to the government for adoption in order to improve. The points of attention raised by the conference on the work of the various ministries of the government are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Military Affairs: After listening to the government's military report, the Council is greatly comforted. Over the past eight months, the various battlefields in Jiangnan have been able to adhere to the Commander-in-Chief's intentions, strive for initiative in various battles, and achieve considerable results. Other war zones without battles have also been able to secure the battlefield and continue to implement our goal of depleting the Japanese. Although the Japanese have increased their troops, our army has still been able to recover Fuzhou and Zhengzhou, crush the Japanese offensives in Shanggao, and stabilize the war zones in various places. All of this is clear evidence that our army is becoming increasingly superior. In terms of military reorganization, it has been able to proceed on schedule according to the planned plan, which is even more progress. Regarding political training, military management and political training have been coordinated. Regarding supplies, the rules for distribution have been revised according to local conditions, and the replenishment of soldiers has also been carried out according to plan. Transportation, hygiene, communications, and air defense equipment have been further strengthened, making our army's maneuverability increasingly enhanced. All of this is clear evidence that our army's strength is increasing. Under the command of the Supreme Commander, our entire army is becoming increasingly favorable in terms of momentum and strength. We cannot but represent the people of the whole country and pay our respects to our Commander-in-Chief and all officers and soldiers. The Council summarizes the public opinion and expresses its expectations to the military authorities in four points: Ensuring the source of troops: The conscription of recruits should comply with the three-year principle. Grain, clothing, and blankets should be provided in a timely manner during the conscription process, and the publicity and promotion of military service should also be carried out effectively. Improving supplies: Attention should be paid to the nutritional requirements of soldiers, and clothing, shoes, and military blankets should be sufficient for distribution. The facilities for medical care in field positions should be further improved. The government is expected to pay close attention to all of this. Strengthening training: Military reorganization is proceeding on schedule, and spiritual education is the main factor in reorganization. Strict military discipline: Please refer to the Council's past resolutions on strictly enforcing military discipline and unifying military orders, clarifying rewards and punishments, consolidating military morale, so that our entire army can become a whole fighting body to strive for the final victory and complete the great cause of fighting.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs: The report on foreign affairs work shows that the government has been able to continue its efforts to strengthen its ties and cooperation with friendly countries such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in accordance with its established national policy. It is also in the process of promoting and establishing diplomatic relations with other friendly countries. The foreign affairs authorities have also paid attention to matters such as adjusting and strengthening embassies and consulates abroad, improving intelligence, cultivating talent, and safeguarding the safety and welfare of overseas Chinese. The Council deeply hopes that the foreign affairs authorities will implement the above-mentioned work guidelines and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. Regarding the adjustment of embassies and consulates and the cultivation of talent, the Council believes that the following matters should be brought to the attention of the foreign affairs authorities and handled effectively: The purpose of the training class should be to ensure that there are specialists in foreign affairs for any country in the future. The cultivation of foreign affairs talent should also pay attention to enriching their knowledge of the country's culture and history. Foreign affairs agencies should establish links with education and examination agencies to ensure that students in the political and foreign affairs departments of universities and those who are admitted through foreign affairs examinations receive sufficient specialized and general knowledge to facilitate their future performance of duties.

<h3>Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Japan Enter an Extremely Delicate Stage, Will Gradually Deteriorate Under Economic Sanctions, Roosevelt's Trip to Warm Springs for Negotiations Has Been Shelved</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th: President Roosevelt met with Kurusu and Nomura for 45 minutes yesterday. It is now rumored that Tokyo's response to the United States' strong policy statement on Pacific peace may be an attack on Thailand within a few days. Whether Japan originally intended to continue negotiations is not indicated. The shelving of this negotiation is obviously due to the sudden hardening of the United States' attitude and the announcement of its policy. When Kurusu walked out of the White House, reporters asked questions one after another. He shook his head and showed a slight anger. He said that he knew nothing about the rumored Japanese attack on Thailand. Sources in the diplomatic circle said that the United States' strong statement actually ended the hope of resolving the Far East issue. After several meetings, Hull changed from his conciliatory tone to a strong reaffirmation of the principles of the United States' basic foreign policy. Most people believe that this deterioration will be prolonged without a sharp or sudden break. It is generally believed that US-Japan relations will gradually deteriorate under continued economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 28th: Kurusu and Nomura told reporters after the meeting at the White House yesterday afternoon that they had a very friendly conversation with President Roosevelt. When asked whether the negotiations to resolve the US-Japan issue would be reopened, Kurusu replied that he had not received orders to return home, but did not say whether he would meet with Secretary of State Hull again in the next few days. Reporters also asked whether the US proposal received on Wednesday provided a basis for continued negotiations. Nomura replied that he had not received instructions from Tokyo and could not answer. Well-informed sources here believe that yesterday's meeting was of particular importance in the current stage of discussions. Hull remained at the White House for a quarter of an hour after the Japanese ambassadors left to talk to the President. When asked whether he intended to meet with the Japanese representatives again, Hull replied that he had no appointment with the Japanese representatives.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from New York on the 28th: Although the Japanese envoys are still in Washington, President Roosevelt has scheduled to go to Warm Springs for vacation today and return to Washington around Wednesday. The New York Times pointed out in an editorial today that the US-Japan talks have not broken down, but said that the basic positions of the two governments are far apart. For its own security interests, the United States vows to provide assistance to all countries resisting aggression and will continue to aid China. The newspaper finally warned Japan not to assume that the United States, because it has greater obligations in the Atlantic, is powerless to act in the Pacific. New York, dispatch on the 27th: Well-informed and qualified people in Washington mostly believe that the US-Japan talks, which have lasted for twelve days, may be declared to have broken down at any time. From the perspective of the situation in the Pacific, this has gradually had a good impact on the future of the general democratic countries, especially on the future of China. The worries and pessimism held by some parties have also gradually been dispelled. The US government has decided to firmly adhere to the basic principles clarified by Secretary of State Hull in the past, believing that all issues in the Pacific should be based on this principle in order to seek a final solution. Most US newspapers today published the news that Hull presented Kurusu with a document in a prominent position. The headlines used mostly said "The United States Has Refused to Accept a Munich on the Pacific." Kurusu's visit to the US President today failed to improve the tense relations between the US and Japan. Although Kurusu denied the claim that he intended to return to Japan in a short period of time, it is generally believed that Kurusu may intend to return home soon. Observers said that Hull's presentation of the document to Kurusu was the final step taken by the US side, and the second step should be taken by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th: The US-Japan talks, which are related to the Pacific war and peace, are said to be on the verge of collapse. Observers said that the answer can be obtained when Tokyo replies to the US proposal on Wednesday night. Their pessimistic mood was heightened by the rumor that Tokyo's strong policy statement to the United States may be an attack on Thailand within a few days. President Roosevelt is understood to have reiterated the US position to the Japanese envoys in clear terms. It is learned that President Roosevelt emphasized that the United States will not retreat from its basic policy in the Far East.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 28th: Although general opinion here believes that the situation in Japan is extremely serious, some observers still believe that Japan is currently using its intimidation tactics. Two senators held this view today, one being Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Democrat, who said that although the situation has reached boiling point, it will not boil over. The other is Senator George, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a Democrat, who said that the movement of Japanese troops towards the Thai border is mostly for intimidation.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Gary on the 28th: The Japanese ambassador to Peru, Sakamoto, flew to Washington yesterday to consult with Kurusu and Nomura.</p>
<p>Japan Uses Period of Quiet to Deploy New Offensive Positions</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Singapore on the 28th: The news that the US-Japan talks have stalled has put the entire Far East in a state of anticipation. Although officials here have refused to make any speculation about future developments, they all believe that various events may occur. According to some people, although the Japanese army in China and other places has shown little activity in recent weeks, it should be known that this does not mean that the Japanese army is not preparing for action, and there is various evidence that the Japanese army is using this period of quiet to deploy new positions, so that once Tokyo sends a signal, it can launch a rapid attack.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 28th: The US-Japan talks in Washington are now apparently approaching the final stage. British newspapers have published contradictory news that a limited agreement will be concluded momentarily and that the negotiations have now failed. However, according to well-informed sources, the news received so far from the Washington talks is purely speculative, and no sign of progress in the talks has been obtained, nor has the hope of a quick result been estimated. The scope of the talks cannot be estimated either. However, any proposal made by the Japanese envoys must first be studied with extreme caution by the United States before it can consider easing the economic pressure currently being applied.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from London on the 18th: Here yesterday, the reports from Washington said that the United States had decided to abandon the attempt to reconcile with Japan, and all expressed skeptical welcome. Although there is this pessimistic report from Washington, there is still a hope for reconciliation in the establishment of a three-month agreement to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, while the basic points of disagreement between the US and Japan remain to be explored. Observers believe that the requests of Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi and Economic Representative Song Ziwen in Washington to President Roosevelt will not cause the government's attitude to change suddenly. As for the rumored willingness of the United States to lift part of the economic sanctions against Japan, non-official critics are taking two distinct attitudes: to make reasonable concessions after obtaining an agreement from the Japanese side; to fear that after Japan breaks through the principle of establishing economic sanctions, it will further expand its original intention to achieve countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Held Regular Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Contents of US Note</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: In the regular Cabinet meeting this morning, Foreign Minister Togo reported to government officials on the contents of Hull's note to the Japanese special envoy. The Cabinet then discussed the US-Japan talks. Before the meeting, the Prime Minister met with the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, and the Vice Minister of the Army.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The US-Japan dispute apparently hinges on whether Hull's note to the Japanese envoy is a counter-proposal from the United States that requires a Japanese response, or whether the US Secretary of State has given a final answer to the talks that have been going on since April. This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Kiishi Kazuoichi stated that the US-Japan talks in Washington are still in progress. Tokyo received Hull's note to the Japanese special envoy last night and is currently conducting close research. The spokesman refused to criticize the contents of the note and refused to state whether or when Japan would respond. The spokesman mentioned the meeting held by Hull with the representatives of China, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands, saying that the United States is conducting this talk as a matter of caution, because the US-Japan negotiations naturally involve the interests of other powers in the Far East, so this action has to be taken. Today, the editorial of the news agency that sells newspapers reiterated Japan's determination to implement the principles listed by Prime Minister Tojo, and continued, "If the United States still insists on absolute principles and disregards Japan's conditions for a peaceful solution to the Pacific issue, there is little or no room for the current US-Japan talks to have a successful outcome. The success or failure of the talks will depend on the talks that continue based on Japan's reply." Kiishi Kazuoichi also told news reporters about the newspapers' claim that any temporary agreement will be rejected, saying that this is the voice of the Japanese people, and the government must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>US Adopts Tough Stance, Japanese Side Says Situation is Critical</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The Allied News Agency issued a serious warning today, saying that the Pacific situation is critical because the US attitude towards Japan has become tougher. It also said that Hull's note to the Japanese ambassador indicates that the US negotiations have been decided, and judging from the situation in all aspects, hope is minimal, and the hope for the continuation of the negotiations is also minimal. The Allied News Agency indicated that Japan may also take a tough stance, and said that because of Hull's note, there is no opportunity for the US-Japan situation. It concluded by saying that the reason why Britain is very optimistic about the results of the US-Japan negotiations is because Britain still hopes to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. The Asahi Shimbun said that the success or failure of the negotiations depends entirely on whether the US note can uphold Japan's national position. It also said that Hull's note is believed to be the US's final word on the negotiations. If the United States recognizes Japan's views, US-Japan relations may be adjusted again, and the situation in the Pacific may be maintained in its tranquil state, as the name "Pacific" expresses it. Otherwise, if Japan's existence, rights, and interests are threatened, Japan will proceed with its firm determination. It also said, "We are prepared to deal with any situation."</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: The Japanese newspaper explained today that Hull's note to the Japanese ambassador yesterday was the US's final demand and predicted that the negotiations were nearing collapse. The Asahi Shimbun said that if Japan cannot accept the US's final demand, Japan will reject it with an unwavering determination. The current situation has decided, we are watching the actions of fate and preparing to deal with any future events. The Chugai Commercial News said that senior Japanese government officials will discuss the details of Hull's note today. The newspaper, which has always represented the government's views, is said to have said that Japan's instructions on the note will determine the fate of the negotiations in Washington, and also pointed out that the document has a disrespectful attitude.</p>
<h3>Army in Hawaii On Alert</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from Honolulu on the 28th: The entire army in Hawaii was ordered to be on alert today. Armed soldiers are patrolling military centers, bridges, and highways everywhere. Authorities refused to declare whether the order for this sudden alert was related to the Pacific crisis. It is recalled that the same order was issued several months ago when Japanese funds were frozen. It is learned that the army has been on alert in various parts of the island for several weeks.</p>
<h3>Kaya's Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 28th: Minister of Finance Kaya gave a speech, saying that if Japan fails in China, the future will be unimaginable. Not only will North China lose its current form, but Manchuria may also be spared. If Japan makes a slight mistake at the moment, it will return to the position of 1895, with its hands and feet bound, unable to move beyond the islands.</p>

We are now living in difficult times, but these difficulties were not of our own making; they were caused by neighboring countries. The Thai Prime Minister reiterated Thailand's independence, urged the people to remain united and avoid conflicts with outsiders, and said that if we can find a way to avoid war, the future will be very bright. According to Singapore Radio, Sangar also asked his countrymen not to view Vietnamese or Malay soldiers as troops about to invade Thailand, as he had received assurances from Britain, the United States, and others to respect Thailand's independence, and Japan had also stated that it would do its best to promote friendly relations and guaranteed that the Japanese troops in Vietnam had no intention of invading Thailand.

<h3>Problems Urgently Awaiting Resolution</h3>
<p>No threat to life is as serious as housing, just as is the case with food. This problem has arisen with the occurrence of war. Although there is hope that prices will be stabilized, the heavy exactions of rent, tips, key money, search fees, and security deposits continue unabated. New tenants are faced with the severe conditions for renting houses that are what they are, "Take it or leave it." This is the proud response from landlords and rental agents. Old tenants are suffering more and more from rent increases. Some landlords use foreign merchants as intermediaries to increase rents and evict tenants. Some use hooligans to force tenants to accept rent increases. Others hire vagrants with special backgrounds to abuse good tenants, who can only swallow their anger and comply with their extravagant demands. Some falsely claim that the entire building is being sold, selling each unit separately, taking it back for their own use, and forcing tenants to move out. Others disregard everything, demolish old houses, drive out old tenants, and rebuild new houses in order to demand high rents and other extraordinary gratuities. Some even cut off water and electricity when rent increases are not agreed upon, making it difficult for tenants to cook or see in the dark, regardless of the risk of fire and theft. Do these people not realize that what they do to others today may be done to them tomorrow? Do they not think that the mills of God grind slowly but surely? The retribution for hoarders and speculators is often unimaginable. It is understandable to demand high rents for magnificent buildings. However, the residents of alley houses and small to medium-sized buildings are mostly ordinary laborers and wage earners. Landlords should be able to make a reasonable profit, but to compete with speculators and hoarders is to treat real estate as a commodity for speculation and to manipulate rents. This is as harmful to public life as hoarding, but it is not treated the same as controlling essential goods. This not only fails to deter hoarders but also leaves the public unconvinced. There are precedents for curbing rent increases, and essential goods are not limited to food. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate the threats and exactions imposed by landlords and to alleviate the endless suffering of tenants.</p>
<p>However, unscrupulous sub-landlords who oppress sub-tenants are even more guilty than the main landlords. In addition to excessive rent increases, they also demand security deposits and extra fees. A living room on a floor may be rented for eighty or ninety yuan, with extra fees of one or two thousand yuan. In other cases, a single wing room may be rented for one hundred and sixty yuan per month, with a three thousand yuan gratuity and a four thousand four hundred yuan security deposit. Such black-hearted sub-landlords are rare, but there are many similar cases. As a result, some people use renting as a form of speculation, using every possible means to find houses and then subletting them for huge profits. In addition, sub-landlords impose restrictions on sub-tenants regarding water usage, electricity usage, the number of people in a family, the number of children, the frequency of visitors, the location of cooking, and the restrictions on daily life. All these harsh rules are designed to restrict subtenants. They rent out every possible space in the house, front and back, up and down, the drying platform, and the stove shed. They do not care about the number of people living in the house, whether it is light or dark, whether the air is bad, whether diseases can spread, or whether access is obstructed. They do not think about how to cope with disasters. They only seek huge profits and still enjoy the maximum right to use the property. This directly attacks sub-tenants, increases rents excessively, and indirectly damages public health and endangers local safety. They are vermin of the people and parasites of society. If they are not severely punished, even if the main landlords consider the plight of the tenants and do not go too far, there is still no hope of solving the general housing problem.</p>
<p>Housing has become so speculative that there are still buyers for newly built houses and apartments for rent or sale, no matter how many are built. Sub-rents are extortionate and extraordinarily high, yet there is no shortage of tenants. This means that people are willing to accept harsh conditions, and one cannot simply blame the insatiable demands of landlords. It is important to understand that supply creates demand, and there are great disparities in suffering and pleasure, which cannot be generalized. Sub-renting is popular despite the high rents and gratuities because tenants are often evicted for no reason and must find a place to live, moving frequently and reluctantly accepting the situation, regardless of the exorbitant rents and gratuities. Secondly, anyone who has traveled in the interior knows the hardships and inconveniences, which makes the hope of dispersing the population of Shanghai unrealistic, and the housing problem remains difficult to solve. Thirdly, the prevalence of speculation in Shanghai attracts people from the interior to concentrate in Shanghai, which further increases the difficulty of the housing problem. As for the sale of real estate, regardless of how high prices rise, there are still buyers because: (1) Wealthy people from the interior who are avoiding Shanghai have suffered greatly from the oppression of large and sub-landlords and are willing to pay a high price to find a new home to relieve their anger and enjoy a peaceful life. (2) The exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is so different that buying Shanghai property with Hong Kong dollars is still the best deal, and real estate is both an investment and a speculative target. (3) Jewish people who have been driven to Shanghai are contacting old friends in Shanghai and using their familiar skills in buying and selling real estate and stocks to pursue huge profits. (4) People who generally consider legal tender to be worthless are hoarding goods and also collecting real estate, not only in Shanghai but also in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuchang. (5) There are too many newly rich people in the past one or two years who are spending their windfall on real estate, regardless of the high prices, as a way to preserve their wealth and enjoy a comfortable life, so they flock to it like ducks to water. From this perspective, the general public is nothing more than meat on the landlord's chopping block. The special circumstances cannot be used as a benchmark for rents, and are unique to the newly rich phenomenon. It is lamentable to be meat on a chopping block, and unless there is improvement, how can we face the public?</p>
<p>How can we improve the general rental situation? It is very difficult! The appeals of the people and the expressions of public opinion have gone unanswered. The focus is not only on the fact that real estate owners have long sleeves and are good at dancing, and that their voices are widely heard, but also on the fact that so-called taxpayers are real estate taxpayers! Can the representatives produced in this way truly prioritize the welfare of the public, or can they forget the interests of the class they represent? Furthermore, the increase in real estate rents can indirectly increase public revenue, which can be used to supplement the frequent increases in salaries. Therefore, it is difficult to suppress real estate rents and reduce public revenue. As a result, the main landlords can be allowed to do as they please, but why should the sub-landlords be singled out for suppression? However, this is not to say that public servants should not be impartial, as once they are in public service, they should forget their personal interests and think about the welfare of the public. The housing problem cannot be ignored. Improving the rental situation will not infringe on the legitimate interests of the landlords. The public hopes to eliminate exorbitant demands and curb insatiable exactions! Can the authorities in the two concessions rely on the Import Association to control retail prices, but not use the Real Estate Association to suppress real estate prices? The majority of real estate in Shanghai today is: (1) owned by foreign merchants; (2) owned by Chinese merchants, but mostly registered and managed by foreign merchants; (3) owned by bank trusts and real estate management offices. Gathering representatives from these three groups to solve the rent problem should be easily resolved. If there are solutions for the rents of the main landlords, it should not be difficult to strictly suppress the greed of the sub-landlords. The key to suppression is: (1) Rent should be standardized based on a certain period, and should not be increased thereafter. By standardizing rent based on a certain period, the landlord's existing interests will not be damaged. However, there may be discrepancies in determining the period, either using the average of the past few years or the rent for a certain period this year. The principle should be fairness. (2) All gratuities and miscellaneous fees other than security deposits (limited to a maximum of three months) should be prohibited. Violators will have the fees confiscated and returned to the person who paid them, and will also be fined the same amount. (3) Key money should be limited to the actual cost of renovation and the deposit for furniture. (4) Sub-landlords should publicly disclose rent receipts to tenants. The method of dividing rent should be based on the rent, taxes, electricity bill (or water bill), and the necessary repair costs, or the profits that can be made, and should be distributed proportionally based on the location, size, and quality of the rented room. If the total rent exceeds a certain percentage, the tenant may report the matter for investigation, even if they have already rented the property. (5) Leases should not be terminated unless the tenant is in arrears with rent, the landlord needs to take back the property for their own use, or the tenant has other illegal or improper behavior. (6) Rent should not be increased without a legitimate reason; even if rent is increased, the concession authorities must be notified and an investigation must be conducted with the tenants before approval is granted. (7) If the adjustment or restriction of general rent does cause a loss of tax revenue to the concession, the amount of the shortfall may be compensated by increasing the property tax. (8) Those who use housing as a tool for speculation and profit should be punished.</p>
<p>All of the above is not intended to promote the decline of the real estate industry, but to maintain the mutual interests of landlords, tenants, and sub-tenants in order to safeguard the people's livelihood. This is an urgent measure that should not be seen as a long-term plan.</p>

The situation in the Volokolamsk area is the most tense, with the Germans attacking with six tank divisions and five infantry divisions in an attempt to encircle our army, but they have not succeeded. In the past 24 hours, the situation has become even more serious. Our army is still resisting calmly. The German army has discovered that it is attacking at a great cost, and the results are not very significant.</p>

<p>Soviet Union Uses New Aircraft to Destroy Steel-Clad Locusts</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th – Aircraft designer Ilyushin has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union. Pravda wrote that Bakhmutov and Ilyushin were pioneers in military aviation. The aircraft they designed set records and became famous throughout the world. They not only worked hard on aircraft technology, but also invented a new type of anti-tank attack aircraft. This type of aircraft is equipped with machine guns and cannons that can counter enemy mechanized units. The value of anti-tank aircraft has been proven in battle. Soviet anti-tank aircraft are now destroying the fascist steel-clad locusts.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th – On the 27th, our army fought the enemy on all fronts. On the 26th, 19 German aircraft were shot down, while we lost four.

The Romanian troops, who are helping the Germans, originally planned to rest after the Battle of Odessa, but are now still being used by the Germans to fight. According to reliable statistics, the German losses in Crimea have exceeded 100,000 men. The German losses in the Sevastopol area are particularly heavy. At present, the Red Army and the Black Sea Fleet are still inflicting heavy damage on the enemy every day.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Meet Southeast of Tobruk, British Army Increases Armor Car Strength, Can Control Entire Battlefield in Future</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – A Middle East British Army communiqué states that British and New Zealand troops who met southeast of Tobruk yesterday are now advancing westward under fierce resistance from Axis forces, while enemy columns attempting to cross into Egypt have now begun to turn back westward to join the main German and Italian forces west of El Agheila, which were severely defeated by the British Eighth Army. British armored units heavily damaged this enemy force that had crossed the border. After two hours of fierce fighting, it was defeated, and a large number of tanks retreated northwest to Gambut. Reliable sources here say that the British army in the Western Desert is still fighting to strengthen its connection with the garrison in Tobruk. The meeting of the New Zealand vanguard with the garrison there will allow the British army to use it as a supply base, which the German army is doing everything possible to prevent. Both sides have been constantly repairing tanks damaged in recent battles in the past two days, foreshadowing a major battle that is about to break out.</p>
<p>Reuters, Libya, 28th – The main force of the British armored vehicles is now busy reorganizing and strengthening its strength in preparation for the next armored battle. Judging from the current situation, the next battle will be able to control the entire battlefield, and there is hope for a great victory. During the lull in last week's tank battle, German General Rommel broke through the left flank of the British army on Sunday night with a mobile column in an attempt to contain the British forces south and southwest of Tobruk. Twelve hours later, a small squadron of tanks arrived, and the two forces met and charged to a point on the southern border of Sidi Omar, which was occupied by the British Indian troops last week, but was attacked by British tanks and South African armored vehicles. As a result, part of the enemy column headed south towards the Halfaya Pass, and part attempted to turn back to its own positions, while the remainder resisted our army's frontal attack near the border.</p>
<h3>Gondar's Italian Garrison Surrenders to British</h3>

<h3>Complete Withdrawal of American Troops Yesterday Morning: Enthusiastic Farewell, Two Patrol Ships to Follow, US Authorities Urge American Nationals to Return Home Quickly, Difficulties with Pacific Shipping, Further Delay May Make Ship Allocation Impossible</h3>
<p>The Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, ordered to withdraw from Shanghai, its Second Battalion having already departed on the Madison轮 a few days ago for Manila, the remaining First Battalion and headquarters personnel, a total of 335 soldiers and 69 officers, personally led by Commander Colonel Howard, left Shanghai on the Harrison President 轮 at 1 pm yesterday, ending their 14-year history in China. Chinese and foreign personages, considering the team's time in Shanghai and its considerable contributions to maintaining local security and protecting the lives and property of the people, flocked to the Customs Wharf to see them off, admiring their demeanor with even greater enthusiasm than the previous morning. Another 57 expatriates accompanied the ship to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Parade in Formation</p>
<p>The First Battalion and headquarters officers and soldiers, more than 400 in total, departed from their barracks at 196 Xiaoshadu Road at 9 am yesterday. Despite the cold wind and the sadness of parting, the spirit of the entire unit was very high. The procession was led by the Police Department's patrol car team, followed by the team's military band, conducted by Captain Jiffin, then more than 300 American soldiers, with Commander Colonel Howard and his staff bringing up the rear. The procession included the Commissioner of Police, British and American expatriates, and the soldiers' wives and close friends. This last group of American troops withdrawing from Shanghai embarked on their journey to bid farewell to the people of Shanghai, accompanied by the majestic military music. Universal Pictures also sent a film car to follow the procession and capture the scenes along the way.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Farewell</p>
<p>The unit proceeded along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road to the Customs Wharf. All along the way, one could hear military music and cheers from the crowds. As the unit turned east from Jing'an Temple Road, the well-wishers and participants became even more crowded, with Nanjing Road packed with people and traffic blocked. Expatriates overlooking from the Huizhong Hotel scattered colored confetti and streamers as the procession passed, making for a spectacular sight. At 9:30 am, they arrived at the Customs Wharf, where more than 10,000 Chinese and foreign well-wishers had gathered. In addition to the Customs Wharf, numbers 11 and 9 on the Bund were also packed, with no room to set foot. The Shanghai Municipal Police dispatched two red police vehicles and more than 20 Chinese and foreign detectives to form a large circle on both sides of the wharf to maintain order and control traffic.</p>
<p>Distinguished Guests at the Wharf to See Them Off</p>
<p>Among those who went to the wharf to see them off yesterday were diplomatic envoys and military representatives from various countries, including Captain Atteg of the French Defense Forces, Staff Officer Frolin, Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, Colonel Sakato, Captain Kawaii, representing the Japanese Navy, and representatives from the British Navy. Diplomatic representatives included British Consul-General George, American Acting Consul-General Stanton, Dutch Consul-General Bowen, Polish Chargé d'Affaires Rosset, Czech Chargé d'Affaires Stefan, Chilean Chargé d'Affaires Marin, Mexican Chargé d'Affaires Panrado, Belgian Consul-General Gassim, and Brazilian Consul-General Mia Gu. Others included Li Derer, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, American Director Minsid, Commissioner of Police Bowen (Smith Deputy), Commander of the Volunteer Corps Mann, President of the American Chamber of Commerce Henderson, President of the British Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Allied Nations Association Keller. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, arrived by naval launch from the Luzon舰, accompanied by Commander Brock of the Luzon舰 and other naval officers, including Captain Jeff. It is also noteworthy that representatives of the Free German Movement shook hands with Howard at the wharf and solemnly told him, "Germans inside and outside Germany are now officially at war with Hitler and unanimously express their deep sympathy for the free and democratic stance taken by the United States." As soon as he finished speaking, cheers erupted. The Orphans' Home also presented the unit with a camp flag with the words "Wishing the Fourth Regiment a safe journey" written in black ink, which fluttered in the wind, increasing the sense of emotion. The chefs and waiters of the Qimei Restaurant in the Central Market at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, to thank the American soldiers for their patronage, temporarily formed a band and followed the regiment, playing music as they went, which was quite amusing.</p>
<p>Howard's Address: Gratitude to the Citizens</p>
<p>At 9:45 am, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze Patrol, delivered a farewell speech, and Colonel Howard gave an address in reply, expressing his gratitude for the cooperation and enthusiasm shown by the citizens and various countries in the past. He also commissioned Hamilton to present a silver shield from the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury as a memento. The ceremony was simple and solemn. At this time, many Shanghai ladies stepped forward to shake hands with the unit, and in small groups, farewells and best wishes could be heard everywhere. At 9:55 am, the unit, accompanied by music and applause, marched into the designated Manley &amp; Muller small steamer. At 10:10 am, the steamer slowly set sail, with music playing loudly on board and ashore, including "God Bless America" and the song of farewell. The officers and soldiers and the well-wishers waved their hats and handkerchiefs, responding to each other. The Harrison President 轮 set sail for Manila at 1 pm.</p>
<p>Police Receive the Vacated Barracks</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy barracks, located at 243 Gordon Road, were already guarded by two Indian constables dispatched by the Gordon Road Police the day before, after the officers and soldiers of the Second Battalion withdrew the previous morning. The barracks at 196 and 155-6 Xiaoshadu Road and the barracks on Seymour Road, vacated by the First Battalion yesterday morning, were taken over by the Gordon Road Police at 6 am yesterday and guarded by Indian constables. According to sources from the Dazhong News Agency, they will not be used for other purposes for the time being. It has not yet been decided when the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will move into the premises. Yesterday afternoon, when passing by the premises, only a few workers were seen dismantling telephone lines.</p>
<p>U.S. Authorities Urge American Nationals to Evacuate Quickly</p>
<p>After the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy battle fleet departed in two batches, the Yangtze Patrol flagship Luzon号 and the gunboat Wake 号 (recently arrived from the upper reaches of the Yangtze) will also set sail for Manila in the coming days. The U.S. consulates in Hong Kong, Japan, and North China yesterday reiterated their call for all American nationals to evacuate immediately. There are currently 613 male and 416 female expatriates in North China and Inner Mongolia who are about to arrive in Shanghai. Due to the perilous state of Pacific shipping, it may not be possible to allocate ships to evacuate American nationals in the short term. It was confirmed here yesterday that a Jardine Matheson ship, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in December, has now been requisitioned by the Dutch East Indies government and will not sail to Shanghai. Public opinion believes that this is a sign of the Dutch determination to quickly strengthen the defense of the Dutch East Indies. It is not yet certain whether Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol, will accompany the Luzon号 and Wake 号 or remain in Shanghai. If the Luzon号 and Wake 号 sail to Manila soon, it will be their first time sailing in the open sea, as the two ships were originally shipped from the United States and assembled in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wake Gunboat to Remain in Shanghai for Standby</p>
<p>It is generally believed that after the Luzon号 and Wake 号 leave Shanghai, the American gunboat Wake 号, which belongs to the same team, will remain in this port. The Wake entered the port yesterday afternoon to carry U.S. consular officials and American civilians who are unable to evacuate in case of emergency. Since the outbreak of the war in 1937 and the sinking of the gunboat Panay 号 in December of that year, the strength of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol has gradually declined. In 1937, the fleet consisted of six ships: Luzon 号 (flagship), Guam 号, Monocacy 号, Tutuila 号, Panay 号, and Wake 号. Later, the Panay 号 sank and the Monocacy 号 was dismantled in Shanghai, leaving four ships. Then the Wake 号 arrived, but soon the Guam 号 left again, leaving four ships until now. A notice for rent has been posted on the door of the purchasing office of the construction building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, also indicating that the Wake 号 and Luzon 号 will soon depart.</p>
<h3>Price Ceiling Set for White Coal Shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the French Municipal Council announced that the selling price of white coal shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai shall not exceed 600 yuan per ton. The French police have been ordered to pay close attention to this matter, and those who do not comply with this order will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Storage of Dangerous Goods: Site Plans Required</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, effective November 1, a new rule has been added to the licensing regulations for the storage of explosives, gunpowder, petroleum, and other dangerous materials, as follows: "The licensee shall, when deemed necessary by the Council, draw a plan of each floor of the site, indicating the approximate location and quantity of the stored materials. This plan shall be kept on the site and shall be readily available for inspection by the Council's Fire Department at any time, day or night."</p>
<h3>Priority Given to Industrial Organizations for Coal Usage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to allocate coal to Shanghai at the official exchange rate provided by the Stabilization Fund is now underway, and there is hope that the coal situation in the city will improve. It is reported that the Council is giving priority to industrial organizations in this plan, and is currently inquiring with various factories about their monthly coal needs and studying the replies received. Once the allocation process is implemented, large quantities of coal will begin to arrive in Shanghai. According to a Council official, it has not yet been decided whether this coal will be shipped to Shanghai by commercial firms on behalf of the Council, as in the case of flour, or whether the Council will import the coal itself.</p>
<h3>Retailers Profiteering, Citizens Report Violations, Municipal Council to Impose Penalties in One or Two Days, Similar to French Concession</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the Council will take action to penalize retailers who sell goods above the price ceiling within one or two days. Since the announcement was issued, the Council has received letters from citizens reporting retailers profiteering. Those who report violations to the Council should attach the receipt and the name of the reporter as evidence.</p>
<p>Seventy-Seven Cases Penalized</p>
<p>Tan Gutii, Chairman of the French Concession Municipal Council, stated that in the two weeks from November 1 to 15, the French police, under strict orders, arrested a total of 770 merchants who disregarded official orders and sought only to profiteer. Among these cases, 38 were for retailers failing to display a complete list of price-controlled goods, 24 were for selling goods above the price ceiling, 12 were for selling goods underweight, 2 were for selling rice to individuals exceeding the limit, and 1 was for hoarding flour. All were penalized.</p>
<p>Efforts to Expand Price Controls</p>
<p>The French authorities are fully cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council to shoulder the responsibility of eliminating hoarding and profiteering. However, formal actions that are currently under consideration cannot be disclosed in detail, as cracking down on hoarding and profiteering requires lightning speed and surprise. Tan also stated that the French authorities and the Council are in constant contact to jointly expand the scope of the control plan. Relevant officials are constantly studying market conditions to include more items in the price control list to be issued at any time. It is reported that some hoarders have hoarded goods and are unwilling to sell them at the price ceiling to avoid losses, and are still storing them in warehouses. However, these goods cannot be stored for a long time, so some have begun to rot. Tan concluded by noting the importance of the Council's price control task, stating that it is illegal for users to purchase goods at the price ceiling that is more than what they need and resell the excess portion at a high price.</p>
<p>Three Catering Establishments Closed for Eight Days</p>
<p>The French police recently discovered that three catering establishments, Jiang Mingxuan at 153 i on rue Sainte-Marie, Ling Buyun at 153 D on the same street, and G. Skepichenko at 235 on the same street, were charging more than the price ceiling for certain foods (selling at 4 yuan or 4.2 yuan for items with a price ceiling of 2.4 yuan) in violation of the French Consulate's order of November 16, 1941. These offending shops have been closed for eight days, and their business licenses have been confiscated during this period.</p>
<h3>Council Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>Large quantities of Council foreign rice have arrived. Yesterday, the Taikoo Shipping Company's Hanyang轮 arrived from Hong Kong with 10,200 bags, and the Anhui 轮 also arrived from Hong Kong on the same day with 5,100 bags, for a total of 15,300 bags. The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, effective December 2 (Tuesday), no transportation permits will be issued to those who have not registered rice or flour with the Council.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Encourages Police to Work Harder, Special Inspection Held After US Troops Depart, Increased Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Li Derer, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Fei Pu, Director-General, inspected the Shanghai Municipal Police at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps parade ground yesterday afternoon, under the command of Acting Commissioner of Police Smith. Medals were awarded to 54 police officers for their meritorious service and 94 officers for their longest service. In his address, Li stated that, with the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment now withdrawn from Shanghai, the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of the citizens has increased, and everyone must work harder to live up to expectations. At that time, a Chinese woman, whose husband had died in the line of duty, requested an award from Li, and Li also awarded her a First Class Special Service Medal.</p>
<h3>The Grandeur of the US Military's Departure from Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Second Battalion of the US military departed the previous day, and the First Battalion boarded ships early yesterday morning. On Nanjing Road, citizens bid farewell, creating an unprecedented scene. The left picture (top) shows the Qimei Bar band playing music to bid farewell, and (bottom) shows the procession arriving at the New Customs Wharf (Dahua Photo).</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Publishes Statistics on Family Accounting, About 80% of Over One Thousand Account Books Issued Last Month Were Eligible for Selection</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Social Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently published the following statistics on the accounting of Chinese staff families: In October, 1,020 account books were issued, and 881 families kept records. 139 families either applied to stop keeping records or failed to keep records. After reviewing the account books, nearly 80% of them were eligible for selection, and over 65% had excellent results. The December account books were sent out on November 24. The families that received the October account books are requested to pay attention to the following points: All items such as salary, various subsidies, and income tax should be listed separately. Pay attention to omissions in the expenditure section. Those who have not filled in the housing form (Form 2) must fill in the dimensions, number of windows, and other items. As of the end of the accounting period on December 31, all purchased but unused items should be entered in Form 4. Each monthly account book should be handed over to the staff in the nearby post office counter on the first day of the following month to avoid errors. The strong cooperation of various families in this accounting effort has made a great contribution to the general public. With only one month left until the end, it is hoped that you will remain consistent and strive to complete it.</p>
<h3>Savings from Birthday Noodles Used to Support Student Aid, Retired Elder Benefits the Needy</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's Student Aid Fund received 200 yuan from Retired Elder, savings from birthday noodles, in a gesture that is deeply appreciated. On the Elder's 60th birthday, he lamented the country's tribulations and the people's hardships, and declined birthday celebrations from relatives and friends. He donated the savings from the noodles to the Student Aid Fund. It is hoped that elders from all walks of life will emulate the Elder's initiative and benefit needy students. At the same time, Mr. Shao Shanshi donated 50 yuan to the Student Aid Fund on his 30th birthday. His benevolence is admirable and worthy of emulation. The list of donors yesterday is as follows:</p>

<h3>Collecting Discarded Tickets to Help Ticket Sellers Skim Profits: Dismissed Ticket Seller Arrested and Detained</h3>
<p>The evil habit of ticket sellers of the British-owned tram company in the Public Concession skimming profits has persisted for a long time. Although the company authorities have tried to prevent it, it has been difficult to achieve results due to the tricks and methods used by the ticket sellers. The methods used by the ticket sellers include colluding with dismissed ticket sellers and deploying them at different stations. If there are ticket inspectors at the front station, they will</p>
<p>Rush to Communicate</p>
<p>before the tram reaches the station, so that the ticket seller is alerted and has already distributed the tickets to the passengers before arriving at the station. They also collude with the tram drivers. If they see ticket inspectors at the front station, they will suddenly stop the tram several times as a signal, and then reduce the speed so that the ticket seller can calmly issue tickets to the passengers. Therefore, although the company has increased ticket inspections, it has not been effective. The company has already found out about the communication methods, but because it has not been able to obtain concrete evidence, it is</p>
<p>Difficult to Crack Down</p>
<p>They have only notified the ticket inspectors to adopt a surveillance policy on the actions of dismissed ticket sellers. At 10:30 pm yesterday, a Western ticket inspector discovered Wang A'si, a dismissed ticket seller from Haimen, wandering around the trolley bus station on Yuqiaqing Road near the New World. He was chased away, but Wang suddenly threw a paper bag to the ground as he fled. The ticket inspector apprehended Wang and opened the paper bag, which contained about 200 discarded tram tickets that had been thrown away by passengers. He was handed over to the police and taken to the Old Gate police station. Under investigation, Wang confessed that the discarded tickets were collected and resold to ticket sellers on the tram for mixed use, and he could earn about two yuan a day. He was detained and sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for fraud. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>

The shop discovered the counterfeit money and summoned the police, who arrested the two customers and took them to the police station. They confessed that the counterfeit money gang was run by Yang Gengsheng (34 years old, from Jiangbei), and that their headquarters was located at a certain address in the North China Apartments at the intersection of Rue du Père Huc and Avenue Lafayette.

<h3>Guard Post Overreach: Teasing a Woman Leads to Trouble; Rifle Discharges, Injuring Woman's Arm</h3>
<p>A local woman, Zhang Linmei, 19 years old, residing at No. 77, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, along the street, has been working as a factory worker at Jinrong Wood Factory at the intersection of Beiler Road and Father Du Road. Yesterday afternoon, after finishing work, Zhang Linmei returned home. After dinner, around 8:30 PM, Linmei was doing laundry in the main room downstairs. At that time, the main door of her residence was not closed. A Vietnamese constable (No. 422) passed by the door and, seeing Linmei alone inside, stood outside the door and began teasing her. However, Linmei ignored him. The constable continued to make wanton jokes repeatedly. Linmei, unable to bear it any longer, began to close the main door. The Vietnamese constable became enraged out of humiliation and raised the rifle he was carrying to knock on the door. Somehow, it suddenly discharged. With a shattering sound, the bullet flew out, piercing a hole in the door and entering the main room, severely injuring Zhang Linmei's left arm.

<h3>Mr. Li Shao and Wife's Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Shi Chong</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yongsen of Yushan, along with his wife, Ms. Shao Jingyun, held an exhibition of Chinese and Western arts at the Daxin Exhibition Hall for seven days. Yesterday was the first day of the opening, and despite the drizzling rain, visitors flocked to the exhibition. It was a display of elegant arts, a perfect combination, and a delightful story in the art world, not to be outdone by the exclusive beauty of Zhao and Guan. Mr. Li's Western paintings, mostly watercolors, have a faithful style and possess a lively and transformative spirit. The colors are bright and pleasing to the eye, setting them apart from the heavy, turbid, and crude works of today, as different as being on the floor and on the bed. Among the landscapes, "Zhaofeng Park," "Hou Alley," and "Slum Alley" are the best. Among the still lifes, "Dahlia" and "Peony" are the best. Among the figures, "Girl" and "Leisure" are the best. The meticulous composition, fluent brushwork, and harmonious tones all reach a mature and refined level. Ms. Shao's works, inspired by the Song and Yuan dynasties, exhibit both classical refinement and individuality. The two pieces, "Joy Overflowing the Eyebrows" after Bian Luan and "Reeds and Geese" after Li Di, are exquisite and possess a rich charm. The four pieces of silk bands depict white plum blossoms, red bamboo, crimson maple leaves, and camellias as background, respectively. The colors are beautiful, the brushwork is vigorous, and there is no trace of the delicate, feminine air. Other pieces, such as "Okra," "Hyacinth Bean Flowers," and "Lotus," are fresh and elegant, all excellent compositions. The two landscapes, imitating Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, have such vigorous brushwork that it is hard to believe they are the work of a woman. This is truly admirable. I believe that Chinese painting reached its peak in the Jin and Tang dynasties, ascended to its summit in the Five Dynasties, and flourished in the two Song dynasties. The style was rigorous, the skill was exquisite, and the masters were truly worthy of reverence. From the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it was still possible to inherit the ancient constitution. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, various schools emerged, with the exception of the Dongshan landscapes and the Kunling flower-and-bird paintings. Countless schools arose for a time in one place or another. In recent painting styles, there is a general tendency towards innovation and novelty, and many unorthodox paths have emerged, making it impossible to rectify the situation. Now, observing Ms. Shao's works, which adhere to strict orthodoxy and revive the traditional style, it is almost like hearing a welcome sound in a desolate valley.</p>

<h3>Spot Yarn Eagerly Seeks to Unload, but Few Receive Deliveries</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rose in the afternoon of the previous day, declined again yesterday. This is because spot yarn transactions have been cut off, and prices are falling steadily, with a lack of buyers. As the end of the year approaches in an instant, the financial situation is becoming increasingly tight, so some floating goods are eager to unload and seek cash. As a result, they have to change their strategy and sell on the exchange market, so the chips are becoming more loose. However, under this environment, the bulls are still fighting. However, there are very few buyers, so there is no other way than to post heavy discounts. The discounts posted by various parties today are even higher than the previous day. The highest price for 20-count variable horse yarn was 2,520 yuan, and the low price was 2,406 yuan.</p>
<p>The exchange market opened in the morning with the remaining momentum from the previous day, with the opening price at 2,520 yuan. Shortly thereafter, it fell straight to 2,475 yuan. However, the bulls still did not let up and rose again to 2,500 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold then fell, and spot yarn was sold at a discount, but there were no buyers. In addition, Japanese yarn and thread fell across the board. At the same time, large bull speculators spit out their positions, and the market gradually fell to 2,410 yuan. The closing price was 2,415 yuan. It has been observed that the total volume of transactions in half a day was approximately 1,850 bales. In the afternoon, the market was extremely depressed and entered a state of stagnation. The opening price was 2,410 yuan, falling to 2,400 yuan, and the closing price was 2,406 yuan. Futures delivery was suspended.</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions were quiet, and prices fell by 30-40 yuan, but there were few buyers. The power of the past has now been diminished.</p>
<h3>Cash Plunge Comes Terribly: Returns to the 14,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market plunged again in the grey market, and prices have retreated into the 14,000 yuan range. This is because foreign news widely reported that the new negotiations between the US and Japan were still difficult to approach, and the tension in Vietnam and Thailand made the parties look again towards decline. Although the overall transaction volume of the day was auspicious, with Xianghe buying 520 taels, Tianyuan buying 310 taels, and Yongcheng, Shengji, Shihe, exchange dealers, and securities firms each buying 200-some taels, Mingfeng alone sold 820 taels, Tongkangyong sold 400-some taels, and Xiangxingyong and Decheng each sold 330-350 taels. The selling pressure was strong, causing the price to rise at one point to 14,800 yuan, but it immediately fell. Before the evening close, it reached a low price of 13,470 yuan, and finally rebounded by a small 950 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,560 taels. Ornaments rebounded by a small 70 yuan, and silver was average.</p>
<p>Cash Falls Nearly 1,000</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 14,600 yuan at 9:00, which was 150 yuan higher. Xianghe, Xiangyu, Yong, Hesheng, and Tianlu helped to sell, and the price immediately fell by 400 yuan, sharply declining to 14,200 yuan. Suddenly, securities firms, exchange dealers, Chengji, and Tianyuan came with force to buy, and the price immediately rose by 600 yuan, rising to 14,800 yuan. Negative rumors arose again, and sellers gathered. Xiangyu, Yong, Mingfeng, and Gonghe came with force to sell, and many short positions were quickly cut, and the price collapsed by 1,300 yuan, falling to 13,500 yuan. Xianghe, Shihe, Tianyuan, and Yongcheng bought in at noon, raising the price to 13,900 yuan. Xiangxingyong sold again, and the price fell again, closing at 13,650 yuan at noon. The price opened at 13,600 yuan at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, which was 50 yuan lower. Xiangxingyong covered short positions, and Xianghe and Chengji competed to buy, raising the price by 150 yuan, rising to 13,750 yuan. Mingfeng, Shunyuan, and securities firms sold with force, and the price fell again, retreating to 13,470 yuan. The price closed at 13,500 yuan at 4:00 PM, a further decrease of 950 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a high-low of 1,330 yuan on the day. The retail price of gold from the cash shop was 13,700 yuan, and the buying price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Ornaments Follow Suit</p>
<p>The selling price of silver ornaments per tael in pawnshops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, both rose to 1,500 yuan in the morning, then rose another 100 yuan. From noon, the price was listed at 1,400 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 150 yuan, rebounding by a small 70 yuan. Silver was still listed at 22 yuan, and the black market was 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Buyers Wait and See; A Japanese Military Ticket Market is Established</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the central bank and exchange banks both had flat exchange rates, and the exchange rates of small banks also did not fluctuate. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies first tightened and then tended to flatten. The US dollar was at 3.75 yuan, and it was once difficult to obtain a settlement for a certain import foreign firm. However, a certain Chinese speculator sold 1,000 US dollars, and there was a continued supply. Buyers waited and watched, and the trend appeared to stabilize. The afternoon was even more dull and flat, and no further transactions were concluded. At the 4:00 PM closing, the US exchange rate was 2.4375, and the US dollar was 3.75 yuan, which was the same as the closing rate on the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: British and American gold pounds fell by 20 yuan along with the cash price. British gold tickets, however, rose by one yuan. US gold tickets retreated to 27 yuan and 20 cents, falling by 1.6 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets rose by one cent. The trend of Japanese gold tickets was stable, and the market price was flat. Korean tickets, however, tended to fall, and the evening market retreated to 2.6 yuan. The trend of military tickets was bullish, and the evening market rose to 3.27 yuan. It is rumored that a military ticket market will be established on the first of next month, and the address will be the former site of the American ticket market.</p>
<h3>Coarse White Rice First Strong, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Public Association Price Setting: It was seen rising at first, but ultimately, due to the lack of trading, it gradually fell back. For example, the spot price of 24 coarse white rice for the current month opened at 210 yuan, then fell to 203 yuan, and then to 202 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price was 200 yuan, a small decrease of 4.5 yuan compared to the previous market.

For December 10, the morning price was 208 yuan to 4.5 yuan, and the closing price was 199.5 yuan. The afternoon opened at 198 yuan to 200 yuan and 5 cents, and the closing price was 201 yuan, a small decrease of 5 yuan. Hong Kong coarse rice was 178 yuan in the morning and 175 yuan in the afternoon, a small decrease of one yuan. Taikoo White B Mark was 195 yuan, and Dutch Red was 173 yuan to 69.5 yuan in the morning, and 72 yuan to 65 yuan in the afternoon. The closing price was 67 yuan, resulting in a small decrease of 3 yuan. The total volume of transactions for the day was over 4,000 bags of spot goods and over 8,000 bags of futures.</p>
<p>Sugar continued to arrive in port. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In addition to transporting the Public Works Department's foreign rice, it also brought 6,000 bags of sugar, which were unloaded at the company's dock in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt Short Positions Feel Impatient; Large Speculators Remain Unmoved; Weak Foreign Stocks Cause Environment</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds was weak yesterday, and sentiment was depressed. Selling pressure was strong in the trading floor, mainly because people were still waiting for the official disclosure of the US-Japan negotiations. Large speculators remained unmoved, and general short positions gradually became impatient and left the market, resulting in a continued decline. However, Type E was relatively firm, because it was about to be drawn, and there were more short positions to cover. Type D required 60,000-70,000 units, and there were very few sellers, so they had to raise prices to buy in. Yesterday morning's market price hovered within 9 yuan. It once broke through 9 yuan before noon, but still retreated. Buyers were mostly Jiufeng and Hongda, and sellers were mostly Tongsheng, Runde, Dazhong, Xiexing, and Yuan. In the afternoon, Xiexing continued to sell, and Tongkang and Houda also came out. Jiufeng continued to buy, and Zhongfu slightly covered back. The trend continued to weaken. As a result, except for Types D and E, which were slightly better by 2 to 4 cents, the rest continued to decrease by 3 to 8 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.12 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory's new stock were traded at 10 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Exchange Stock Market: The decline was very strong, forced by the environment. The US-Japan negotiations may have collapsed, and the selling pressure was very strong. Although there was some low-level short covering later, the rebound was small, and the decline was still quite large. There was no market in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The British company Zheng Guanghe Limited will pay an interim dividend of 3 yuan per share of national currency on its 140,000 ordinary shares for the year 1941 on December 12.</p>
<h3>After All, Price Limits Can Be Effective: Japonica Rice is Sold as Soon as it Arrives; Flour Market Briefly Pauses: 15,000 Bags of Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was still at a standstill, while new northern and southern japonica rice and jian yuan rice arrived by land and water, totaling more than 200 bags. The actual demand from local food stores and shops also increased slightly. In addition to direct distribution by trading companies, there were also 100-some bags of northern and southern japonica rice and 30-40 bags of shady yuan and a dozen bags of du jian rice on the market. However, the owners, afraid of the 150 yuan price limit, were willing to sell as soon as the rice arrived and did not dare to adhere to the asking price. As a result, the selling prices of each grade fell by 3-4 yuan again. Northern Kunshan new japonica rice was 186 yuan, 183-4 yuan, and then 176 yuan. Bo Dao was 173 yuan to 170 yuan. New high shady yuan was 185-6 yuan, and original duzi jian was 170 yuan. Although the selling prices were similar to the previous market, the quality has gradually declined.</p>
<p>The flour market was in a soft state. As for wheat, small factories bought several hundred bags of Jiangbei wheat on the market at 73 yuan. The Dayuehua factory, however, was reluctant to inquire at the original price, as the flour market was falling.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang Wheel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the company's dock in the French Concession. In addition, the Anhui Wheel also arrived in Shanghai in the morning, also carrying 5,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The ship is currently berthed at the company's pontoon, and will be unloaded at the dock in the coming days. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Soybeans Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market: there was no trading in the afternoon due to a misunderstanding regarding the entry permits, so there was only half a day of trading in the morning. The price of cooking oil rose by 6-7 yuan to more than 10 yuan due to the rise in Japanese military tickets, and sentiment was bullish. Yellow soybeans also rose slightly, and corn rose by 1-2 yuan. A total of 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 60 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 600 dan of Dayou factory clear oil, 30 dan of Lide factory vegetable oil, 300 bags of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan, 200 bags of green soybeans, and 700 bags of spot corn were sold. There were also more than 200 tons of futures.</p>
<p>400 bags of soybeans were exported to Singapore on the 29th, and 1,410 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Owned Tea Factory: All Tea Sold to Chinese Merchants - Feeling Despair About Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Due to the urgent crisis in the Pacific, the lack of shipping, and the halt in foreign trade, the foreign companies' black and green tea trade has been limited to inter-company transactions, with no direct foreign trade. The black and green rough tea stored in the Japanese-owned tea factories has been sold to Chinese merchants, as the Japanese merchants feel despair about foreign exports. The market was only for store tea yesterday. Merchants from Tianjin bought 120 dan of Longjing baking green tea, with Longjing selling for 730 yuan and baking green selling for 350 yuan. There were no other transactions. On the 29th, 175 boxes of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong, 107 boxes were shipped to Singapore, and 33 boxes of silk were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>Factory-made cloth initially mirrored the upward momentum of the previous day, with opening prices uniformly rising. However, due to weak actual demand, the trend reversed, turning sluggish. "Double Elephant" coarse cloth opened at 94.25 yuan, a 1 yuan increase from the previous day, but the market faltered, dropping to 92 yuan. Other types followed a similar pattern of rising initially and then falling. As a result, white cloth prices fell by 0.5 to 1.5 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Customer sales were stagnant, with very few transactions in the local market, totaling just over 200 pieces, mostly flannel and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the market lacked the strength to rise. Prices for all types of cloth uniformly declined. Futures trading on the exchange was inactive due to a lack of settlements, and the spot market was also unusually quiet. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 89 yuan but steadily declined to 86.5 yuan by noon. The market then stabilized with no major fluctuations, closing at 87.5 yuan, a decrease of 3.5 yuan. "Jiao Junzi" (a type of cloth) serge started at 3.3112 yuan and fell to 3.2 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, primarily due to sluggish actual sales.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Fabric囤戶神氣</h3>
<p>Due to the cold weather, actual sales of overcoat fabrics have increased, and those hoarding inventory are demanding high prices, showing no intention of selling. However, those who need the fabric have no choice but to negotiate with them to make a deal. Yesterday, top-tier fabrics such as "Kaysman," "Head" cloth, "Kao Hua," and herringbone patterns were mostly priced around 400 yuan per yard. "Pearl Head" and "Silver Gun" fabrics were generally priced around 300 yuan. Plain-colored overcoat fabrics were priced at 160 yuan for "Asia-Pacific," 120 yuan for "Mei Feng," and 100 yuan for "Rong Tai." Pure wool Polish overcoat fabric was priced at 130-140 yuan.</p>
<h3>Willow Stripe Suan Wei Fabric Sells Widely</h3>
<p>Sales of gray plain Suan Wei fabric have slowed somewhat due to the weather, but wholesale and囤積transactions remain numerous. Black and dark blue colors are selling briskly. Wide and narrow, thick and thin willow stripe Suan Wei fabrics are especially popular, with high demand from Western tailors. Top-tier Western fabrics are selling for 150-160 yuan per yard, second-tier for 110-120 yuan. Top-tier Eastern fabrics are selling for 100 yuan, second-tier for 70-80 yuan. Top-tier fabrics from local factories are selling for 85-86 yuan, second-tier for around 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cutch Extremely Expensive</h3>
<p>Recently, due to a prolonged lack of new arrivals, the market supply of cutch is exceptionally tight. Prices have been as high as 450 yuan per package, but the trend remains firm. Recently, the market price has been called at 500 yuan, another increase of 50 yuan, and remains robust.</p>
<h3>Metal Market Remains Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Metal trading has been affected by firm and high purchase prices, making it difficult to expand sales channels. Both local and foreign business is scarce. Traders are reluctant to lower prices due to limited inventory and weak bottom lines. As a result, actual sales are sluggish.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Peddlers in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>— Wu Jian San</p>
<p>In the villages of the Dutch East Indies, one often sees Chinese people pushing a cart full of miscellaneous goods, their faces covered in sweat, hawking their wares in all directions. The Malays call them "Kolontong" or "Tjina Mindering" – these are the so-called "Overseas Chinese Peddlers."</p>
<p>These overseas Chinese peddlers mostly hawk sarongs, embroidery, antiques, leather goods, threads, and various food items at bargain prices. They load their merchandise onto a wheeled cart and push it from village to village. This is very convenient for Malay housewives who live far from the market and are unable to leave their homes. No wonder that when the overseas Chinese peddlers arrive, they are greeted with the same excitement as if meeting a lover, enthusiastically waving from afar and shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"Baba (Note 1)! Mali sini (Note 2) ya!"</p>
<p>Even when paying in cash, the prices are much higher than in the market; and if buying on credit, the interest rates are frighteningly high (four cents per guilder per day, which amounts to 14.4 guilders per year). But they often just grab at the air.” Therefore, these overseas Chinese peddlers make considerable profits; for example, if they sell goods worth 1,800 guilders at cost price in a year, they can earn 6,000-7,000 guilders including profits and interest on credit. Most of them also run "small money houses" to provide loans to the locals, with interest rates of two cents per guilder per day, which amounts to six cents per month. Because they are willing to work hard and endure hardship, and are also "good at making money," they live a decent life overseas; at least much happier than the "Qingtian peddlers" who roam around Europe.</p>
<p>However, this type of peddling is also difficult. The locals often refuse to pay their debts, and if pressed for payment, they resort to violence. As a result, although they can earn 4,000-5,000 guilders a year, they often have 2,000-3,000 guilders of debt that they can't collect. And because these are remote and lawless areas, thieves often commit robberies; overseas Chinese peddlers often encounter such disasters, losing all their belongings and becoming penniless. They are even sometimes stabbed or shot to death.</p>
<p>These peddlers are mostly from the Min and Yue regions. There are also some Shandong people who sell "Shandong silk" and other fabrics, and some Shaoxing people who sell so-called "Shanghai sundries." Because the Dutch East Indies' entry tax (150 guilders per person upon arrival) is forfeited after six months, they usually sell in the Dutch East Indies for four or five months before going to British territory for a while and then returning. For the sake of food and clothing, they travel the world like migrant birds; coming in the spring and leaving in the autumn. Every time I see their faces, tanned black by the tropical sun, and hear their heavy breathing like oxen, I can't help but think of an old poem:</p>
<p>"To steal a living in this world is also bitter and hard!"</p>
<p>(Note 1) Malays call people "Baba," which means "elder brother."</p>
<p>(Note 2) Malay: "Mali" means "come," "sini" means "here."</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Scientists Who Risk Their Lives</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>Even today, many people still think that scientists are people who spend their lives in laboratories, constantly analyzing substances in test tubes and creating foul-smelling chemical mixtures. But modern scientists are not like that. They also risk their lives, just like soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>Take Professor Paul Flory, a toxicology expert, for example. In a poisoning case, he suspected cheese, but after repeated chemical tests, he couldn't prove that the cheese was poisonous. So he started eating various kinds of cheese himself. As a result, he finally ate a poisonous cheese. Naturally, he became very ill, but he didn't care because he had already proven his case.</p>
<p>Not only tasting poison, but there are also people who let a kind of African tsetse fly bite themselves. This tsetse fly transmits a terrible sleeping sickness. Sufferers have headaches, are sleepy, look haggard, and eventually die. This was done by a doctor in Africa, his assistant, and a native. None of them had sleeping sickness, so the doctor first injected a guinea pig vaccine and then let the tsetse fly bite himself. Because he wanted to test the effectiveness of his new treatment, a drug called Germanin. Fortunately, his drug was very effective, and he recovered. But what a great risk he took!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if a person who freezes to death in a blizzard suffers? There is someone who can answer that question, who can tell you what it feels like to freeze to death in extreme cold. He is Sir Frederick Banting, a scientist at Cambridge. In the specially prepared cold room of his laboratory, he conducted a self-freezing experiment.</p>
<p>At first, he felt very painful. But at a certain moment, the feeling of cold disappeared, followed by a lovely warm feeling. He was not exposed to sunlight, he was exposed to cold. His nerve center had stopped fighting, his blood had returned to his skin, ... his temperature had dropped rapidly, and he was already hovering on the edge of death. What a heroic experiment!</p>
<p>Some geologists, in order to study volcanoes, even risked going deep into the crater to observe them. The volcanoes they observed were active volcanoes, with the constant danger of death. But for the sake of science, they disregarded life and death.</p>
<p>Inventions</p>
<h3>Flight Training Vehicle</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>Thousands of aviation trainees in the United States Air Force can now practice flying on land during flight testing without having to soar into the clouds. This land-based flight vehicle was invented at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and is now being tested at Buck Field. The seat, control stick, rudder pedals, and other components in the vehicle are similar to those in an aircraft. There is a .22 caliber gun in the front. The seat in the vehicle is suspended, so its tilting, upward and downward movement is completely similar to that of an aircraft in flight. Therefore, the same training effect can be obtained in the land-based flight training vehicle.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen Dad, go out and sing!</p>
<p>This person really had a quick and impatient temper. As soon as he said this, he immediately stood up, holding the cup of tea that Mei Bao handed him, and immediately unwrapped the package of wound medicine, intending to personally pour it down Qiu Haitang's throat. Fortunately, Mei Shi was quick and agile, and quickly stepped forward to take it, while smiling apologetically:</p>
<p>"Is it wound medicine? Mr. Zhang, taking wound medicine requires wine, otherwise, I'm afraid it won't be effective, right?"</p>
<p>"Ah! That's right, I'm confused!" Zhang Yincai's half-statue-like body then retracted back. "Then wait a moment and let this young lady serve you to take it!"</p>
<p>With this, Qiu Haitang's heart calmed down a little.</p>
<p>"Old Wu, I have twenty yuan here, it's nothing, just take it as money for you to buy some food, so that your body can recover easily!" As he said this, he stuffed four very old banknotes into the corner of Qiu Haitang's pillow.</p>
<p>"Ah! Boss Zhang, — can't let you… spend money……".</p>
<p>"What's 'can't'? No matter how unreasonable I, Zhang, am, I will never ask you to return half a cent in the future, so feel free to accept it!" He casually picked up the cup of tea and took a big gulp, then stood up from the square stool, making as if to leave immediately.</p>
<p>"Mei Shi, quickly kowtow… to Boss… Zhang…!" Qiu Haitang tried her best to raise her voice.</p>
<p>Mei Bao bowed deeply to Zhang Yincai and thanked him sincerely a few times. (275)</p>

<h3>Queen's Theatre to Be Completed Soon Decides to Cooperate with MGM Officially Opens Around Christmas</h3>
<p>Today there is news that should be reported to millions of movie fans, that is, the magnificent Queen's Theatre has been completed and is about to open. The Queen's Theatre is located at the intersection of Chaqing Road and Sanma Road, next to Yipinxiang, facing the racecourse, with the most convenient transportation. At the corner, light stands are installed, and in the evening, if you look from the International Hotel, the light will be so bright that the racecourse will be illuminated as if it were daytime.</p>
<p>It is said that the Queen's started construction last year. After construction began, it was first noticed by Western film companies, and behind the scenes, they competed to cooperate with the theatre. Therefore, the theatre authorities decided to increase investment in construction, striving to give the people of Shanghai a completely new feeling at the time of the opening. In two years. The capital was increased from 1.5 million yuan to 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the theatre yesterday, the theatre has decided to show first-run Western films and has decided on new MGM authoritative films. As for the opening film and whether there is a contract with other Western film companies, it is not yet time to announce. Before the opening of the Majestic Theatre, it was rumored that the theatre would show MGM productions, but this news was later proven to be inaccurate. Unexpectedly, MGM films belong to the Queen's. It is said that the Queen's and Dahua's have decided to cooperate with MGM, and it is obvious that the Queen's has other companies' blockbuster films in addition to MGM.</p>
<p>Latest news. The Queen's Theatre has decided to open around Christmas.</p>
<h3>I Secretly Tell You Some Movie-Making Magic (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qian Ben</p>
<p>When a gang of thieves robs someone and gags them, the actor playing the victim doesn't have to suffer in agony. On the contrary, he has something good to eat. I'm not kidding you, these things are all made of gummy candy. Candy is used to make many strange things on the screen. Whenever an actor bites a book or a ball, it's made of candy! Animals are especially fond of candy, so if you see dogs, cats, monkeys, or bears biting curtains, belts, shoelaces, and other things, you can be sure they're biting things made of candy!</p>
<p>Jam and chocolate are often used as blood flowing from wounds, and pickled pork is used to replace human flesh. When someone is to be branded with fire on the screen, a piece of pickled pork is placed on asbestos, and the asbestos is attached to the flesh. In this way, the red-hot iron can really brand the "flesh", resulting in a squeaking sound that is extremely realistic, but in fact, the person's flesh is not damaged at all. Only the pickled pork is branded.</p>
<p>The funniest thing is the substitutes for food. The most obvious example is ice cream, because ice cream melts quickly under the heat of the photographic lights, so potato flour is used instead. These secrets are not noticeable at all on the screen, but once they are revealed, they are not so rare.</p>
<h3>After Seeing "Professional Woman"</h3>
<p>— Yang Jun</p>
<p>After watching the "Professional Woman" performed by Zhonglv at Tiangong, I feel that it can truly reflect the inner pain of professional women in today's society. I think this play will definitely give the audience a great inspiration. At present, general professional women are struggling with the corrupt forces of society. In order to fight for the independent, free, and equal status of women, they are willing to sacrifice their own happiness and prepare to open up a bright path for future female compatriots. We can see their hard work from this play, and Zhang Fenglai is one of the representatives. She has suffered all kinds of bullying from Fang Weide, the director of the unified tax bureau. He tried every means to achieve his goal of pursuing her, but she resolutely rejected him. With a strong will and correct belief, she stood on her own position and worked hard for the oppressed professional women.</p>
<p>Other characters in the play can portray special personalities. The story is well-interwoven, and the performance skills are needless to say. From the beginning to the end, it can tightly grab the audience's hearts and control the audience's emotions. The whole play can be said to be impeccable. Zheng Naili, who plays the flower girl, is innocent and lively. Zhao Nu is the director of Zhonglv. He plays Wang Daoben, with a serious attitude and humor, which is very appropriate for his identity. Shao Hua, who plays Zhang Jinzhong, can also be said to have reached a mature level. He can also show his personality from small movements. Wu Chunzhen's Mrs. Fang reveals a brave woman and is quite commendable. Liao Fan's Director Fang's performance is quite moving. His stubborn thinking and the預of his behavior are performed fluently. He issued an order that all married women should be suspended from employment. Many female employees in the bureau lost their jobs. Zhang Fenglai concealed the fact that she was married and was able to keep her position. She is young and beautiful and is favored by the director. In order to maintain his hypocritical mask of a gentleman and moralist, the director also prohibits his daughter's free love. On the other hand, he shamelessly does many despicable deeds. All kinds of ugly acts are finally revealed. Later, he even used public funds to do speculative business, and the truth was discovered by Li Zhuan. The hypocrite who claims to maintain benevolence, justice, and morality, at this time, is bound to suffer the責of conscience. This活地 depicts the treacherousness and shamelessness of目投機shang. This is not a play, this is simply a縮影of the ugly society.</p>
<p>Miss Liang Liqian, a famous Peking opera amateur from Fudan University (see the picture above), is a famous荀派花旦amateur. She has a charming appearance, a natural golden voice, and delicate inner expressions. Today, she will perform her famous work "花田错" at Tianchan Stage for the benefit of the Zhengyanbao Education Fund. The performance is set to be perfect.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen The Dusk When the Hu Cavalry Filled the City with Dust</p>
<p>Xu Jing also spurred his horse to catch up, shouting, "Liu brother, don't chase the desperate enemy, we should meet the main army crossing the river." Liu Yin's eyebrows furrowed, and he said to Xu Jing, "Little brother was careless and took an arrow in the leg." Xu Jing was startled and said, "Does it matter?" Liu Yin said, "It's generally not a serious injury." Xu Jing then dismounted from his saddle first, helped him down, and sat him down on the grass. The soldiers on the left and right held torches to illuminate the scene. Xu Jing lowered his head, only to see a feather-shafted arrow stuck in Liu Yin's left leg. Fortunately, it was shallow and had deviated, so it had not penetrated deeply. Xu Jing said to Liu Yin, "Brother Liu, quickly pull the arrow out and then we'll talk." Liu Yin nodded. Xu Jing bent down to lift up his battle robe, and Liu Yin untied his belt. He reached out and felt the arrow, gritted his teeth, pulled it out with a tug, and threw it on the ground. Fresh blood flowed out. Liu Yin then slowly rolled up his trousers, revealing snowy white and delicate flesh. Xu Jing looked at this fair leg, which looked just like a woman's, and his heart couldn't help but stir. He said, "Where is the wound?" Liu Yin rolled the trousers over the wound, only to see a very small wound that was constantly bleeding. Xu Jing then used his sword to cut a piece of cloth from his own lapel and wrapped it around the创痕for Liu Yin. He said to him, "I heard that General Bai Xianzong has excellent 金创良药. I will ask him for it tomorrow and apply it for you, and you will recover completely." Liu Yin said, "Thank you for Jing brother's kindness. Fortunately, the bones were not damaged, which is a great blessing in misfortune. I also gave that bastard a dart and knocked him off his horse. If it wasn't for little brother being injured, I would have rushed forward to tie that bastard up." (231)</p>
