<p>路透社卅一日海德公園電羅斯福（見圖）總統昨在此間別墅集合隣友的五百人、舉行羅斯福家庭俱樂部之年會、總統對衆發言、謂震動全世界之危險、今尚未過去、且有較諸一九三九年八月底與九月初更爲嚴重之可能、惟吾人今尚能安然叙首於斯、殊堪欣慰、余以爲吾人皆應祈禱明年此日更作此言云、</p>
<p>合衆三十一日海德公園電　羅斯福總統昨日宣稱、現時世界大戰之危險、或且較戰事爆發時允爲嚴重、總統稱、獨裁者計劃征服全世界、包括美洲在內、渠希望美國或仍能維持中立之和平、惟警告全國謂、和戰之決定、並非完全操諸美國之手、渠此言表示獨裁國未來之侵略、或將逼使美國進入戰事云、雜期福總統係在其家庭俱樂部年會席上、向五百餘鄰人發表演說、渠朗誦一不知名之女記者來函云、「余知統治世界之野心、其範圍之大、包括美洲在內」、據稱、此女記者乃一精明之旅行觀察家、</p>
<p>路透社三十一日海德公園電羅斯福總統昨夜發表美國勞動節之言論、籲請美國人民重新表示高尚決心、略謂、工人、農夫與僱主、皆須團結一致、堅決不撓、庶透澈保衛吾人之民治制度、任何勞役、任何犧牲、皆非所恤、如是吾人所寶貴之自由與傳統物得以繁榮、爲世人之福利、資勞雙方今必了解國防用品出產不斷之重要、此種戰具與原料之出產、爲吾人自己保護所需要、亦爲各國之對於破壞世界各處自由人民之自由興幸福的國家加以　抗者所需要、我美幽人民應以勞動節五十四年歷史中前所未有之最有思慮的、而最莊嚴的精神、紀念此一九四一年之勞動節、而使全世界人民明瞭民治主義與自由之幸福、我美國人民今日遇有保全此民治主義之重大責任、吾人當在勞役中與犧牲中竭其能力、如吾人祖先所爲者、吾美國人民當人人以全副忠貞對此主義各盡其職、而在此勞動節重行表示吾人有担任當前工作之決心、允屬相宜云、衆認美總統此言、殆爲星期一日對於國際事件發表更詳細的言論之先聲、</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日華盛頓電　多數人士相信、羅斯福總統對近衛之覆書、必係再申美政府對世界及太平洋所持之固定政策、至近衛函件、內容雖未宜布、相信必係欲修舊好、並欲與美談判調整太平洋之局勢、</p>
<h3 id="c2">羅斯福野村會談　僅屬於試探性質　赫爾稱未至談判階段 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>合衆社三十一日華盛頓電國務卿赫爾昨在記者席上　、羅斯福總統與野村大使之談話、僅係試探性質、不能認為已至談判階段、赫爾氏兩决重申、此項談話並术越過試探階段、迨後於答覆另一問題時、赫爾稱、此種談話、爲普通性質、詢及美國是否正以美·日談話情形告知中·英及其他有關各國時、赫爾稱、渠不能批評此事、因美·日談話純係試探性質故也、消息靈通界表示、外傳美·日兩國已成立一「基本上之諒解」、顯屬言之過早</p>
<p>海通社三十一日瑞典京城電　倫教昨日正式宣稱、美政府正以美·日會談進展情形通知英政府、但英政府已否知悉日本近衛首相致美總統羅斯福函件之內容、或其通知是吾僅以日本駐美大使野村與美總統羅斯福之談話爲限，則並求加以說明云、</p>
<p>國際社三十一日華盛頓電　華府方面指稱、日木現正謀勸誘美國、寬放其嚴厲的經濟報復手段、日本爲報答起見、或將應允不作進一步之侵略行動、並保證決不進攻新加坡與荷印衆認、此乃日本現在之目標、而非東方事件之普遍解決、蓋欲解決東方事件、美將要未日本、自中國及越南撤退其軍隊云、</p>
<p>國際社三十一日華盛頓電　近衛致羅斯福總統之函件中、所提特別建議、以解決美·日間目下太平洋各間　者、國務院今日正在研究中、惟該函性質究竟若何、仍為一謎、華外交界方面以為、日本願作若干小而重要之讓步、以交換美方較大之讓步、傳美方之讓步包括（二）恢復笑，日貿易、（二）寬放美之凍結命令、（三）美·英·中·荷印放棄包圍日本、（四）經海參歲援助中·蘇兩國、須有一定之限制、衆信、日本爲交換美方之讓步計、願保證決不進攻南太平洋之英·美及荷印利益云、傳近衛致羅斯福之函件、已引起遠　各國極大之關懷中國及荷印均恐美對日若稍露綏靖之象、則民洽國之威信將大受損失、而允以中·印泰國及菲列濱之安全、遭受妨害爲甚云、</p>
<p>華方認日假意敷衍</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日重慶電　近衛致函維斯一福總統函、已引起此間極端注意、並對其內容多所揣測、惟華盛頓電稱、野村呈遞此函後、可望與羅斯福總統繼續舉行會談、則其內容必已在某種程度內、接受美、英之强硬警告、據熟悉日本情形者對此之觀察、謂近衛亦係醉心所謂東亞新秩序者、欲其作一百八十度大轉灣、以脫離軸心、放棄侵略、乃不能想條者、縱使認識美、英之重大決心、領悟危機之迫切、而願出此、、亦爲國內政治環境所不許、强而行之、或目釀成政治暴動、故揣測該函內容、當係在强詞狡飾之外、更以虛言相敷衍、藉此爭取時間、以靜待歐戰之變化、並作更充分之準備、但恐英、美不容其作此打算、且恐其國內極端份子亦不能似近衛耐性耳、至於政府當局、對此尚未表示意見、惟堅信羅斯福、野村談話、即使有何成就、決非建於犧牲中國之基礎上云、</p>
<p>東京官方嚴守緘默</p>
<p>路透社三十一日東京電　據日方牛官消息、日相近衛致美總統羅斯福之函　措詞寬泛、並不詳言兩國間現有問題、此函主要價值厥在姿勢、固不必期望美總統予以答復也、日本於應付極端微妙之國際事件時、維持其解決對華戰事之植立遠東永遠和平之目的、星期五日之臨時內閣會議、考慮野村大使發來關於美總統晤談事之第一次電報、負責方面對於閣議內容現嚴守緘默態度、僅謂、美·日關係有何進展、現尚無從逆料而已、至於事態之究竟趨向、則尚待首相近衛與外相豐田之說明觀察家認在近衛致書美總統之前夕、日皇接見陸軍大臣一事、殊有意義、</p>
<p>合衆社三十一日東京電　日本一般輿論似謂、英大使館之通告英僑撤退、其動機係欲又造成一次遠東危機恐怖與在上次春季間大部份由於英方所造成之恐怖無異、讀者新聲之評論、顯係指美國及日本關於近衛首相致書羅斯福總統之事、政府方面正嚴密研究野村與羅斯福總統談話之報告、日本之未來外交政策、或將繫於此决談判、政府方面稱、日皇現正密切注意發展、羅斯福總統致近衛之覆函內容、將奏逹日皇云、同時日文報紙已停止批評美國之評論、據稱、因美、日緊張有緩弛之可能、德方坦然承認日本之外交政策或已在轉變、德國官方並不表示樂觀、但直至現在為止、政府之討論尚嚴守秘密、</p>
<p>海通社三十一日東京電　此間今晨探悉、近衛首相致羅斯福總統之函件及國際政治局勢之詳細情報、將於本週日本秘密國務會議中討論之、屆時近衛與豐田將提出此項情報之報告云、</p>

<h3 id="c3">歐戰二週年與記者節 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>今日九月一日，歐戰發生適滿二年，復爲第二屆中國記者節之期；吾人身值世變之殷，躬負報道之任，值此紀念，竊願一抒所見，且述其本身之感想。</p>
<p>盱衡今日世界大局，誠可謂為有史以來規模最大變化最烈之動亂時代。自前歲此日德侵波蘭，歐戰爆發，兩年以來，獨立國家之遭覆　或主權喪失蝕損者十又五，為戰爭所直接波及者多至廿餘　亞歐非三洲胥定戰場。茫茫大地。殆無一地不遭戰事浩劫之牽動。以言參戰國家之眾，較之前度歐戰或尚不逮，而變動之劇，蔓延之廣，以及有關因素之繁。損失消耗之甚　則已充分發揮現代戰爭特色　逈非前此任何戰役所能比擬。然而盤根錯節。經兩年間之演進，雖期間險象迭生　屢遭不幸，而時至今日，列強間反侵略之聯合陣綫　在往昔所徒託空想者乃竟告完成。民治國家之作戰目標亦經闡明，其開明睿智實爲往昔國際文告所罕見；彼侵略者　頹狀日增，已有難乎爲繼之勢，（而十年前之首以暴力破壞世界安寗者，今且力謀以談判途徑打開至形緊張之相持局面。其誠意固不無可疑，其窘迫則人所共見。此皆逐漸滋生於混亂黑暗中之嶄新希望。爲歐戰爆發之初所無從想像者也。但此非謂時局當抱樂觀　光明指日可期；經過五日之希墨會議，其所宣示之見解適與民治國家所宣布之作戰目標針鋒相對。仍復悍然固守其征服控制之一貫幻想絕無悔禍之念，意者其此後遭遇愈形不利　求逞之念當亦愈切。羅斯福總統隔昨聲言震動全世界之危險尚未過去，且有較諸歐戰爆發之際更爲嚴重之可能，此一警告　世人實有深切記取之必要。</p>
<p>茲請一述對記者節之所感。報紙爲時代之反映，亦爲時代之前驅，十九世紀美國最偉大之報業者格里列曾謂：一報紙之任務爲領導，繼續不斷以從　領導」；良以今日世事，經緯萬端，世人置身其間，每有茫無端緒之感，而社會之進步，民智之發達，胥視輿論方面之基於遠大之認識與明確之主張，闡明是非，領導人羣，俾得蔚爲風氣，爲時代闢先路，初不僅以報道正確消息爲已足。是以報紙對於人類之貢獻與功能，有時殆可以與偉大政治家與發明家相頡頏。試以近數年來之事實證之：援助中國，爲友邦人士所一致籲求，綏靖政策，亦公正與論所共同抨擊，迄於近頃，則前者既因美國租借法案實施而卒告具體實現，後者在國際外交間亦無復存在餘地，雖其間原因不一，究不能吾認健全輿論於此已獲有重大勝利。戰時英國政府之若干設施　往往以報章輿論之正確見解爲依歸，每能收增强功能彌補闕失之效。然亦惟因報紙從業者於是非之分，眞僞之辨，感應既極敏銳，復鮮假借餘地。以是乃爲侵略罪行者所深嫉，數年以來，暴力所之，往往以公正輿論所蒙摧殘爲最甚。歐亞兩大陸之淪陷區中、報人艱苦奮鬥可歌可泣之經過，曾屢喧騰於報章人口；而中國自奮起作戰以來，文化人之不幸殉難者亦以報人爲獨多。歐陸之自由呼聲今日始終不斷自納粹控制下之淪陷各邦源源傅出；中國若干特殊地區之新聞從業者，亦復排萬難冒電險，堅定立塲，前仆後繼。以從事於正義之宣揚與忠實之報道。雖環境艱困，迄未能符理想於什一　而勉竭所能，或可告無罪於讀者。</p>
<p>今日國際大局動亂方殷，報人之任務乃益形重大。來日事未可盡知，但吾人必竭盡最大之可能以求貫澈其服務國家社會之初願。諸如如何摧抑强權，擁護正義。闡揚民族意識，指導努力途徑，此外大如未來局勢之剖析，戰後建設之方案，小如市民福利之維護，社會互助之遂行，旁及精神之修養　意志之鍛鍊，皆此時此地新聞從業者之應有任務、亦際此記者節日吾人所應自勉互勉者也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">艾登發表演說　闡述戰後秩序　淘汰東西霸權觀念　調整國際經濟關係　請英人犧牲爭取勝利 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>路透社三十一日倫敦電　英外相艾登（見圖）昨在柯文特里演說、略謂、羅斯福·邱吉爾會議時所發之八點宣言、已植立戰後世界據以建設之原則、此項宣言乃各自由國家之憲章、而成立大小</p>
<p>各國平等通用之原則、所有霸權觀念與領袖區域、無論在東、在西、皆予淘汰、戰後世界須有吾人全體之合作、美總統與英相之集議於大西洋、此不僅爲兩大人物之會議、亦不僅爲兩大國民之聯絡、且不僅爲制勝納粹主義之一道、蓋此乃吾人既有作戰韜略、又有和平計畫之宣言也、歐洲與德國今知在希特勒新秩序與吾人新秩序中抉擇其一矣、日前余會謂、英國戰後對德政策必有兩重旨趣、一爲德國須處於不能再起干戈侵犯他國之狀况中、一爲德國未可因經濟破產致成鄰國與世界受毒之泉源、今日余將再進一步曰、此兩種基本原則所支配者、不當僅以戰後</p>
<p>對德關係爲限、且亦遍及一般國際關係、此即羅斯福·邱吉爾宣言之明白意旨也、第一、任何一國必不可處於可對鄰國作侵略戰爭之地位、第二、經濟關係必須調整、庶將來任何國家不致因專獨施行的片面性質貿易方法、而失其適當的經濟地位、蓋政治或經濟上之偏枯、終將引起擾亂也、苟無國際安全、則不能有個別安全、欲求無所缺乏各有工作、或生活標準不致低落必不可得、苟各國未有經濟安全、則國際安全亦不可得、因戰爭與擾亂多由缺乏與失菜而來也、國際安全興經濟安全、名雖爲一、實則不可分離、但若英國與其他目由國家不人人對於和平之要求始終注意、則吾人終不能有</p>
<p>國際安全與經濟安全、現有一事、余認爲須予以充分注意者、即一九一八年戰事結束時、吾人皆抱從此可安居無擾之念、但至今日、吾人已更有覺悟、而知吾人必須注視“保持此和平、如吾人必須奮勇以博此和平然矣、余希望在當前之工作中、國內靑年允共曾參與　役者、應各盡其責、庶已往之錯誤、免再見於將來、余今不妨略述現狀、今與十五個月　相較，確有使人興奮之處、當其時吾人未有敢望吾人命運有如此改變者、但今日吾人若互作安慰之詞、而不知奮勉、則將鑄一大錯、前途尚待極大努力、允其是在出產方面、因最後結果將取決於斯也、余請聽衆再作努力、續有犧牲、</p>
<p>非勝即敗非自由即奴隸、二者任擇其一、此外　他抉擇、生死所繫、犧牲必不可無、而此犧牲必不徒然、蓋今日吾人已有良好理由、可望更愉快的世界終將蒞臨也、艾登旋宜佈蘇聯境內組織波蘭軍隊之進步、最後盛稱首相邱吉爾之功績、謂能以百折不撓之毅力、擔任此重大責任者、除邱吉爾外別無他人、</p>

<p>羅埃三十五歲，在這條航綫上飛行的還有另外七個美籍機師，年齡相差不多，大都來自美國的塔克斯，加里福尼亞　地。另有一個飛行師肯特，路易斯安那人，喪生的明天，正是他的三十七歲誕日。</p>
<p>肯特在昆明至臘戌的航綫上服務，某决他接獲警告，日機正襲昆明。（這决正與我們回程一樣，在下午起飛的，中航機在這綫上每星期飛二次。）他在離昆明相近的臨時機傷降落，等候日機飛過這區域。這臨時機傷已有五架日機在轟炸，那裹並無無綫電裝置，可以警告肯特·日機投下炸彈後已飛上雲層，預備撇離，第五架日機正跟了其他四架飛上去時，發見中航機預備降陸。這是一架陶格拉斯DC-2號，用中英文淸楚標明郵航飛機，黑色大字漆在銀色翼面與機身，可算顯明之至。第五架日機跟着其餘四架打了一轉，一齊穿過雲片向下面竄來，直撲正在滑停的中航機。</p>
<p>肯特立刻被擊斃，是一棵由二十公釐機槍中的子彈貫穿胸膛而死。他倒在旋輪上。助手與無綫電員爬過屍體到艙房中通知乘客，從速離機。他們已經嚇得不墦，不願造决行動，深信這是一架民航機，飛機本身就足以保護他們。他們二人和一女招待員以及另一乘客跳出飛機。華籍助手和無綫電，跳到地上，滾出彈火射程所及之地。</p>
<p>他們望見女招待員從機上逃出。出塵埃滿地的棕色機塲上，她一身白色看護衣服應該顯得很淸楚的。一架日機也看見她了，就跟着竄下來。她從飛機上跑下來，正想躱到樹木下面，跑到半路，有一彈射中腿部，日機迥旋上去後一再回來連發二彈。這位小姐受傷八小時後畢命，尚來不及把她送進醫院，她芳齡二十五歲，嬌小美麗，本擬在這决航行完畢辭去職務，與她在重慶任工程師的年輕丈夫同居。和三人一起下機的旅客，受到一次襲擊，總算爬到安全地帶，助手興無綫電員著未擊死或已逃避他方，不十分明瞭下落。</p>
<p>另外十一個在機中的旅客被機槍掃射，來不及離開飛機都被射死。中航機此後四月中停用女招待員。若沒有這意外事件發生，這位女性服務員是不至中斷的。</p>
<p>一位中國友人說，那些中航機駕駛員都是深切愛好飛行的。這是眞實的。他們愛好飛行，而且在這裹飛行與在美國飛行不同；一切都　由他們自已決定，他們是在空中的自由人物。他們每月薪金一千元，但許多人認爲旅程中的危險非一千元所能酬報。他們有的是在中國生長大。外人在中國極多，無從離開，他們一覺得這國家可愛，就開始爲中國工作。因此這筆薪金就包括一切艱苦興危險在內。只要這種工作存在天，他們永遠不會離去。在戰爭期內他們好像已簽下一紙合同一般。一月中他們飛行八十五小時，餘暇的時間就是去看電影，參加歐式宴會，有一人自己迭小船，另一人是業餘攝影家。鎭上有好的酒吧間，不過你不能飲得太多。他們對於生命並不重視。其中三人已結婚，有一妻子已回美，另外二人即將返國。</p>
<p>我們在朝晨六時半離昆明，周圍的雲像火山噴出來的白沫。不害病的旅客都朦朧入睡。這種氣候大家都認爲是最佳飛機氣候。在　慶，我們這機上的乘客有羅斯福總統代表，三位中國高級將領，一美軍武官加入。這是一羣頗關重要的乘客。我們要等氣候惡劣了再飛到香港，或者必需要預計在黑暗中通過日軍佔領區域。每三天這飛機要飛航二倍由芝加哥至舊金山的距離。這是一决非常的旅程，自一九二八年起，這種旅行每星期總是二决。從中日戰事到現在，中航機每星期行一二〇九〇哩總行程，發生不幸事件僅三十七次。共中旅客遇害者只有二次。</p>
<p>中國航空公司是依照中國法律組織而成，專門運輸旅客，郵件，貨物進出中國各地。對於每一人，這是中國第三條大生命綫。緬甸公路長一千四百哩，由臘戍以達重慶，要經過盤旋山道。除發生意外不計，貨車運入重載的貨物要一星期。中蘇公路在中國一部長二千七百哩，貨車運入飛機零件，軍火彈藥時必需自帶汽油，歷時至少六星期。中航機使自由中國的首都和外界的往返只要三小時，所以它是中國的思想，金錢，郵件的生命綫：政府沒有道三項東西，就無法工作。</p>
<p>在英美印刷的一千萬元法幣就是每夜用飛機運往重慶，紅十字的醫藥供應也由飛機運入，同時把鵭鑛運出，裝赴美國，償還中國一部份債款。外交文件亦由飛機運輸：如各國大使的報告，中國政府對海外使節的訓令。蔣夫人或各部部長到香港去，中航機把他們飛出來。各國使節赴重慶履新，也是由中航機去。這條中國最短的路綫由五架美國飛機，八個機師分別主持。</p>
<p>雖然氣候惡劣，山胍梗阻，並無供緊急時用的臨時機塲，沒有航空信號所，不十分準確的氣候報告，沒有除冰設備等等，雖然中途有被日機襲擊可能，他們仍繼續飛行。並不誇言，他們是在世界上最危險的商業航綫上飛行。三百五十個職員，包括辦事員，機塲工人，機匠，無綫電員，駕駛員一致爲中國做着一件重大的工作，他們有一堅强不屈的意志，他們永遠要工作下去，無人能够阻止他們。中國人知道中航機的價值。華人能尊重美人，恐怕就因爲在一條不可能飛行的航綫上，有美籍機師肯爲他們駕駛五架銀色飛機的緣故中國航空公司女招待員答覆旅客詢問乘機事宜　此女招待員　為魯美咅小姐，在昆明附近殉職者。</p>

<p>貝文從沒有充當國會議員的意思。他在過去二十年中，隨時都可以當選議員，但他寗可韜光養晦，担任運輸及總工會總幹事一職。他不喜歡宣傳，就是在勞工述動中，他也不願接近羣衆，所以他因才能出衆而受人尊敬，　有權力，却並不為衆望所歸。</p>
<p>可是以前使他不孚人望的品性，當他出任戰時內閣勞工大臣一職時，却變為他的德性了。他對於庸碌無能之輩，力事排斥，亳不容情。就是他這種崛强的脾氣，嚴肅的狀貌，亦足以反映出工人的決心。他嘶啞的聲音，和粗暴的言論，已使他成為政府中最有效力的播音者了。值此局勢危急之時，人民聽到柔靡的聲音，和陳腐的爛調，常覺侷促不安。像貝文這樣的播意演說，簡鍊賅括，用人民習用的辭句，向他們發言，因此響應者衆。</p>
<p>一九二〇年，他初次向邱吉爾鬥爭的時候，已經是工會領袖了。當時邱吉爾主張對俄作戰，却被行動委員會反對作罷。現在携手合作共謀拯救英國的兩位要人，原來是政治上的勁敵啊！</p>
<p>因為工黨受工會支配，而工會又受貝文支配，故貝文雖非政治家，却有極大的政治勢力。可是貝文雖畢生盡瘁於勞工運動，認識他的却極少。在工會中，他果然有少數王友，但在工黨中，他雖為人所知而並不著名。他是一個超羣的人物，故易於傲慢。他的强有力的性格，他對於工會羣衆的控制，他那合於邏輯的批判能力，和可以左右人的情感，使他成為工界中最可怕的一個人物。</p>
<p>運輸及總工會的成立，大都出自貝文之賜，而貝文在會身仟總幹事，也使他獲得絕大權力。他以船塢工會作基礎，把三十六個性質類似的小工會合併為總工會。他組織工會，堅忍不懈，到了今日，運輸總工會擁有會員六十五萬人以上，實為世界上最大工會。</p>
<p>可是他却是一個不喜罷工的工會領袖。他願作長期談判判，以達到圓滿的解決，寗可妥協，而不願用脅迫手段。這或者是鑒於一九二六年總罷工的慘敗而然。一九三七年，英主喬治六世舉行加　禮時，倫敦公共汽車工人以要求改善待遇而實　罷工，貝文却拒絕承認罷工，拒付罷工時期的工資，目斥此種舉動為共產黨煽惑。他以嚴厲手段與他自己的工人作戰，在四星期後，工人被迫放棄罷工之時，他便把罷工領袖逐出了工會。</p>
<p>從前視為工運動中左派有力領袖的貝文，現在却成為左派的死敵了。近年來常聽到貝文是工會運動獨裁者之說，任何人敢阻撓他，必遭他無情的對付。年輕的工人，都抱怨說他早年的熱忱，已一變而為審慎持重？他自建設了世界上最大的工會，和眼見工人待遇大為改善以後，對於他一生的工作已感到滿足，而不願再為他們奮鬥了。</p>
<p>但是他必将繼續奮鬥，以保衛他費盡心力所造成的勞工運動，那是無容置疑的。他們知道他的痛恨法西斯蒂，出自真誠。他們知道他認法西斯蒂為工會的最大敵人。他最近曾說，「一個工人若能善於控制一架噴火機，也必能善於管理一個幽家。」由此可見他並未忘却他的本來面目。所以在一九四〇年七月，他接受英國向無先例的大權時、他能深得工人信任。他被任為勞工大臣，對於全國人民的工作可以全權處置。他有權決定在作戰方面，何種工業是主要和何種工業為多餘。他有規定工作時間和工人工資之權。他把數萬工人，自普通工業移至軍需工業。他曾坦白的對資本家說工資不應减少，也很坦白的向工人說，他們的責任不下於軍人，必須自視為工業上的兵士。</p>
<p>他不但要擊敗德國，還決定要改造英國。去年十月間，他在勃列斯托地方說：「最後所建立的社會，應置於最廣大的基礎上，我們所已知的各種特權，從此將集合為一，而消减於無形。」十月中他又在倫敦說，「事情決不能像從前一樣。舊時代已經過去，新時代應當建設了。</p>
<p>至於溫柔含笑的赫伯脫莫利遜，與沉鬱嚴肅的貝文，適成一個對照。勞工運動中以基督教名字為人所熟知的，祇有莫利遜一人而已。英倫士女，雖從未與他有一面之雅的，也常談到這位「　伯脫，」即使與勞工運動漠不相關的人，也不會問「赫伯脫是誰？」工黨中最默默無聞的黨員，也有和他水乳交融的感覺。倫敦的工人，都當他是一個朋友。他在倫敦街道上行走時，警察，報童，女店員和運貨汽車夫，都會向他喊「哈囉，赫伯脫！」這位不戴帽子，手提皮包，匆匆忙忙走着的赫伯脫，這時面露笑容，獨眼閃爍的向後揮手。</p>
<p>當倫敦慘遭　機轟炸時，平民士氣已成為軍事上的一個重要問題，防空壕是不能倉卒立就的。但若以負有防空責仟的大臣一職畀與素為倫敦人士所　仰的人物，民氣當可為之一振。　伯脫莫利遜，便從軍需大臣調任保安大臣，那種車　任務只有他一人負擔得起。因為　安大臣實為　時內閣中三人要職之一。擁擠在臨時防空　內的倫敦東區居民曾互相稱慶道：「有赫伯脫在那襄，就不妨事了。」</p>
<p>這位負着維持水，電，煤氣，溝衆，糧食等複雜機之責，兼負撲滅燒夷彈，移去定時炸彈，拆毀　損房屋，支撑其餘建築物，救死扶傷，安撫災黎，和為八白萬人民建造防空壕之責的人物，却是一個警察和女傭的兒子。</p>
<p>他曾在一九二二年當選為國會議員，一年之後，他　失去議席，一九二九年，又在總選舉獲得勝利，重入議院，直到今日。他在麥唐納的工黨府中做過運輸部長，曾　了兩個月的樞密院長，即入內閣，為年齡最幼的閣員。（未完）貝文夫婦及其女公子</p>

<p>日本郵船龍田丸、於三十日下午七時四十分、由日抵滬、停泊滙山碼頭、該輪乘客、共計八百四十名、其中包括有二十二國籍之僑民、因受凍結令影響、今携其家屬六百二十七名、由日本撤退來滬、</p>
<p>乘客國籍凡二十二此輩乘客中、計為猶太人三百四十九名、美人六十一名、印度人四十八名、德人四十八名、英人三十名、加拿大人二十名、法人十四名、瑞士人九名、及智利·挪威·巴西·匃牙利·義大利·蘇聯·葡萄牙·南美·埃及·波蘭等國僑民、大部分均為商人、其他則為傳教士及教授等、惟其中有美國武官及使領館職員二十七名、及蘇聯五名、頗為各方所注意、除猶太人外、英美人民將在上海轉乘美輪返國、</p>
<p>該輪在美漂流五日該輪當七月二十五日行抵舊金山時、因受凍結令之影響、未敢入港、至在港外洋西飄流達五日之久、嗣經野村與赫爾會談結果、該輪始於三十日開入舊金山港內、據該船長高畑藤一談當時情形云、余船當時有乘客二百零五人、前往美國、適值美國頒布凍結令、故為避免被海軍拘捕起見、遂變更航海方向、在舊金山港外二百浬之海面飄流、</p>
<p>船雖入港貨則被扣當時美方對余船之行踪、頗為注意、報紙每日推測余船方向、各報館並總動員派出飛機、偵查余船踪跡、嗣經野村與赫爾會談結果、始准余船開入舊金山港內、旋美海關竟以不合法手段、將余船所載之貨物扣留、舊金山商工會議所對於此種措置、會發起猛烈之反對運動、並有猶太人·中國人·共產黨等、當余船停泊舊金山時、曾見彼等在汽車上作排日宣傳、</p>
<p>菜蔬腐敗乘客中毒高畑氏嗣後談及該輪返日時、船中乘客中毒事、據稱、余船於三十日下午到達洛杉磯後、除猶太人外、所有日僑及外僑、均預定全部登陸、因檢查等等而受到相當障礙、同時對船員登陸、亦加以監視並限制、即船上之食料品·飲料水·燃料等、均須許可始能愉人、因此菜蔬中遂有一部腐敗、而致發生乘客中毒事件、其時適為返抵神戶之前一日、</p>
<p>茄菲爾輪載僑離滬由日撤退來滬之美國僑民、大部在滬候美運輸艦漢得勝號歸國、但其中若干早已由此間親友為之預定茄菲爾總統輪歸國、該輪於今晨四時三十分由滬啓椗南駛、經香港·馬尼刺·哥倫布·孟買·休達港·取道好望角折由大西洋環航返美、該輪僅載美僑三十五名撤退、並載去寄美郵件一千六百袋、</p>

<p>— 陳</p>
<p>程及，自從去年十一月在大新畫廳一度舉行了水彩畫個展後，即給予人們一個深切的印象。我們不能不說他是使我們興奮和寄予希望的一個靑年盡家。</p>
<p>同時，他更引起了國際人士一致的好感和推頌，法文La　Revue　Nationale　Chinoise雜誌Par　Pierre　Flogny君特為專文介紹，譽為沉悶的繪畫界中的新發見；新中國期畫壇上生長出來的一顆茁壯的苗芽。</p>
<p>雖說我國展開新文化運動以來，新興繪畫還正在醞釀的過程中，直至今日仍沒有建立她適切的基礎，而大多數作家是有着顯著的法國畫風的傾向。可是程及君，雖亦受着同時代作家的陶冶，並不困囿於西洋的傳統，却以他自己高超的才調，創主他獨特的風格。他那種恬靜而熱誠，溫柔而堅韌的性格，正近乎中國民族獨特的風致。在他畫幅中，使我們欣賞着溫柔而靜穆的色調，充溢着詩與音樂的韻味，有使人在初春的寒凉中吸取一股溫暖微風的舒適，又好比在廣漠的原野中諦聽着聲聲的蘆笛，悠遠抑揚而充溢着生命的活力和希望，象微着新中國遠大的前程，他落筆瀟洒，洗練，用水潤澤豪放，為其技巧精練之處。而且，他更擴大了視野，雖則侷處於「孤島」狹隘的地域，他却以表現上海為主題，以社會間的一切動態為題材，以充實他畫題的內容，流露出他豐富的創造力和製作慾來。</p>
<p>現在，他又將近作百六十餘點在大新畫廳舉行個展，會期自九月一日起至十日止共十日。爰誌數語，以作介紹。（重慶航訊）</p>

<h3 id="c57">禁止進口之物品影響上海市場者 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 王海波</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後，我國即逐漸採取管理貿易之步驟。如今日平準會供給外匯時所依據之禁止進口物品辦法，即係民二十八年七月四日所公佈施行者。然上海因環境特殊，一經淪爲孤島後即置身法外，戰時所有之國家法令，概未能在滬推行。此一窟窿之存在，終使我國整個的戰時經濟統制機構，爲之失其成效。</p>
<p>此次美國政府，循我國之請，凍結中國人民所有之美匯資金。爲維持今後中國對外之合理貿易計，關於美匯供需，由指定銀行集中辦理（最初指定者爲在滬之十四家友邦銀行，及我國之中中交三家國家銀行。現經中美英三方商定，改由平準基金會指定在滬之九家中外銀行辦理之）。之初，因美國財部頒佈之凍結法令，極爲含混；對於供給匯票之標準，極爲籠統。因之各銀行各依自己解釋，繼續供應；同時對此又無統一之監理機關，予以管制。一時各行之步驟大爲混亂，終於形成凍而不結之奇突局面。匯市反因此而騷動，投機反因此而劇烈；弄得匯價奇緊，特價橫漲；正當商人與整個社會民生，交受其困。嗣經中美英三方商定關於今後之外匯供給。仍交早先成立之中美英匯兌平準基金委員會執行平準操作，並責其負監理之職。同時將所有在美之中國資金的解凍職權，統交中國的中央銀行辦理。一面由平準會指定九家銀行辦理匯票之合法供給的業務，並明白宣佈今後之一切匯票供給，均須依照民二十八年七月初公佈之禁止進口物品辦法辦理。凡禁止進口之貨，概不予供給。即得以進口之自由貨品，其進口需要，亦須經過中核手續。至於此項審核將依何種標準辦理，目前雖猶無明文規定。但按情揆理，大致將依美財部前頒之第五十八及五十九號兩照會辦理之。此項照會之主旨有二：（一）必需確爲在華早在經營商業之商業，方有申請供給外匯之權。不得假冒和頂替。（二）申請供給匯票之金額，必需與其進口之貨值相等。不得以申請所得之匯票流用別途。</p>
<p>經此調整，滙票之供需範圍於焉判明，審核供需之標準於焉確定，同時又有中美英匯兌平準基金委員會之統一監理與切實平衡，目前匯兌市塲上之混亂局面，乃得爲之澄清。今後滙市秩序恢復，匯價當可穩定，則投機之風自可歛跡。因之過去一般人對於匯市前途疑慮，至此可釋念。惟因上海在近數年內之逍遙法外，進口貿易向來自由，今後將不得不受禁止進口物品辦法之約束。不受禁止之自由進口，在匯票之申核供給制度中，今後亦將受無形之管理。因而又都喚起其對今後上海市塲前途之殷憂者。每當新政實施而各方猶未明瞭之前，此原爲常有之心理變態。然其是否？及其影響之究將何若？亦足咨吾人注意者。</p>
<p>貿易管理之現狀　戰起以還，我國之貿易政策已鑫經變遷。誠以平衡國際收支，實爲國家經濟之根本要著。而在戰爭暑期，形勢先後不同，貿易常趨逆勢。尤當隨時改定方針，維持平衡，使其不致影響社會經濟。就其所經之跡觀之，大致可分四期。在二十七年三月初實施外滙申核制度前止，進出口貿易純屬自由，惟由軍事目的，曾封閉若干口岸，或禁止若干貨物出口。此爲第一期。其後至二十八年七月止，由於外滙申核制度之設施，進口出口貿易之一小部份，政府已開始予以管理。非經申請核准，依法不准進出。此可調貿易管理之胚胎時期。此爲第二期。自二十八年七月頒佈「非常時期禁止進口物品辦法」，（即今日由平準會援引爲審核外滙申請之標準者）及「進口物品申請外滙規則」，「出口貨物結滙領取滙價差額辦法」等之後，以至今日，對於進出口貿易，已開始進入限制輸入及獎勵輸出之階段。但如前所述，由於上海自由市塲之存在，外滙既可自由買賣，進口貿易亦拒受國法之約束。戰事又並未變更上海在全國經濟界之支配地位，反因難民之　集與游資的集中，上海之金融勢力且相對擴大；當地市塲之變動，影響於全國各地之潛在力，尤見雄偉。國家之貿易管理法之既不能推行於上海，於是擘劃雖詳之貿易管理機構，終於形成虛設。所有統制法令，不幸而皆成具文。此爲第三期。</p>
<p>過去的貿易管理之失敗，與滙兌統制之失敗同，原因雖極複雜，但未得英美之切實合作，要不失爲主因之一。今天茲英美皆已先後與我合作平準滙兌之工作，進而又允中國政府所請而凍結中國資金，並同意以中國頒佈之上舉「禁止進口物品辦法」作爲決定滙票供給標準，則過去所安排之貿易管理機構，從此當可見其切實之推行。雖其前途，困難尚多。但就中國貿易政策史之發展上言，目前正踏進一強化時期，殆無疑問。</p>
<p>以現行之我國貿易管理制度而言，其要旨大致有四：</p>
<p>（一）所有進出口貿易，皆須依法進行，不准私相交易。</p>
<p>（二）凡屬出口貿易，經政府指定國營者國營之。民營者，必先將其出口滙票，結售於政府銀行。否則不得出口。</p>
<p>（三）凡屬進口貿易，經政府禁止進口者，即拒給滙票。凡屬進口商需要之滙票，均由平準會指定之九家銀行供給之。供給之前，須經申請及審核等手續；一經核准供給，得按平準會所定之滙率售予之。</p>
<p>（四）凡屬禁止進口之物品，亦禁止其報運轉口。如調劑後方市價，或供給轉種用途，或有其他正當原因，經政府機關核請者，得由財部查酌實際需要，核發購運禁止進口物品之特許證，而後許以進口。</p>
<p>是則可知我國之貿易管制，技術上實以滙兌管理爲主體。即經由滙兌管理而實施貿易管理。因之其成敗仍繫於能否消滅外滙黑市塲爲斷。外滙之黑市塲若不消滅，則不獲核准之進口仍得求之於黑會市塲。惟黑滙市塲所得之進口滙率，當較合法市塲上所得者爲貴。因之其進口物價亦必昂貴。此種辦法，雖未可使所有進口貿易，全部依政府意旨而辦理。但由於黑滙價給予其進口價上之影響，無形中亦略能收抑制之功。至於就貿易管制技術之直接施貿易本身者，則惟禁止進口物品辦法之推行較堪注意。因凡屬禁止進口之物品，今後非特不能取得合法之滙票，且不能通過海關。佔領區之海關縱能通過，如欲運轉內地，則將絕無可能。職是之故，凡在禁止進口範圍內之物品市塲，必首受其影響。</p>
<p>禁止進口之物品　戰時管理貿易之目的，在進口方面者有：（一）爲轉移不急不需之進口爲戰時急需之進口；（二）爲調整國際收支以保障貨幣對外購買力之穩定。（三）爲養成國民節儉之美我。（四）爲發揮經濟戰爭之效果，壓迫對手國出口貿易。（五）獎勵國內代用品產業之振興。以裕民生。民國廿八年七月初公佈之「非常時期禁止進口物品辦法」，即依照此等意義而製定者。應禁範圍，各報所傳計十六類，查其內容，計缺第五第八第十三第十五類四類，應禁稅則號列，各報所傳爲二百卅四項。查其內容，則僅一百六十八項。稅則六二四號瓦及磁磚，原亦列爲應禁之一，今次修正該法時已加剔除；則實僅一百六十七項。若分析各該應禁物品之種類，則大致可別爲（一）奢侈品，或不急不需品。（二）以對手國爲輸入國主體之物品，而可設法向國內或第三軒覓替代用品者。（三）國財確有代用品可以抵當輸入需要者。始按各該物品之用途及性質分，則可將原表改列爲：</p>
<p>（一）棉及其製品類　禁進七七·八〇兩號。</p>
<p>（二）蔴及其製品類　禁進一〇二號一種。</p>
<p>（三）毛及其製品類　禁進一一五，一一六·一二〇一二二，一二五，一二六號六種。</p>
<p>（四）絲及其製品類　禁進一二九至一四五號十一種。</p>
<p>（五）魚介及海產類　禁進二七五至二八三，二八六至二八七，二八九至二九七計二十種。</p>
<p>（六）肉類食品類　禁進三〇〇，三〇二，三〇三，三一四，三一六，三一八，三二一，三二八，三三〇號計九種。</p>
<p>（七）水菓乾菓及其製品類　禁進二九九，三〇四，三一二至三一三，三一五，三一七，三一九，三二九，三三二，三三三，三三六，三五一，三五三至三五五，三六〇，三六四，三六六至三七一，三七五至三七七，三七九至三八二，三八九，三九二至三九四號計三十四種。</p>
<p>（八）糖類　禁進三九和至四〇一號計三種。</p>
<p>（九）酒及其他飲料類　禁進四〇三至四一九號計十七種。</p>
<p>（十）烟草類　禁運四二〇至四二五號計五種。</p>
<p>（十一）礦油類　禁進五二〇及五三二號計二種。</p>
<p>（十二）紙張類　禁進五四五至五四七，五四九，五五〇，五五四，及五五七號計七種。</p>
<p>（十三）獸皮類　禁進五六六至五六八號計三種。</p>
<p>（十四）羽毛類　禁進五七二至五七三號計二種。</p>
<p>（十五）獸骨角類　禁進五七四，五七六，五七九號計三種。</p>
<p>（十六）木材及其製品類　禁進五八九，六〇〇至六〇一號計三種。</p>
<p>（十七）棕竹草及製品類　禁進五九二，五九三，五九五，五九六，五九八號計五種。</p>
<p>（十八）磁器搪磁器類　禁進六〇八及六〇九號二種。</p>
<p>（十九）玻璃及製品類　禁進六一〇至六一二，六一四，六一六號計六種。</p>
<p>（二十）珠寶首飾及化裝品類　禁進六二七，六四五，六五〇，六五三，六五五，六五八，六六七號計七種。</p>
<p>（二一）古玩美術品及裝飾品類　禁進六三三，六三四，六三五，六七一號計四種。</p>
<p>（二二）樂器玩具類　禁進六四一，六五二，六六八號計三種。</p>
<p>（二三）雜貨類　禁進六三八，六六六，六六九，六七〇號計四種。</p>
<p>綜觀所禁各該物品，非爲不急不需，即爲對手國主要產品，或有國產代用品者。如能切實予以禁進，則依民國廿七年進口實況推算，約可省出二萬三千餘萬元，約合美金六千八百萬元，英金一千三百萬鎊。經項鉅額外匯之支用，一經節省，即可移用於當前急需材料之輸入。是在我國，原不過變更外匯用途；而在各國，亦不過轉換其輸出物品；實質上其對華貿易之統計，仍不致有所影響可知。然於上海之消費市塲，則其影響之大，誠堪注意。</p>
<p>禁進與上海商業　現經禁止進口之一百六十七稅則號列之物品，其務年之進口量，均以上海爲其最大之消費港。雖以目前海關出版之貿易統計月報上商品之號列，另用其特編之統計號列，與稅則號列不同，故不易統計其最近輸滬之貿易額。但以稅則號列及統計號列並用之民國二十八年貿易統計年刊上所載者予以統計，則可知此等不急不需乃至奢侈品之進口，上海竟佔全國總額百分之七八十之多。若欲一一列舉，非本文篇幅所許。姑摘其每年在滬進口在一百萬關金單位以上者觀之，則其民二十八年份之進口值，與同時全國進口值比較，有如次表：</p>
<p>每年在滬進口百萬關金單位以上之禁止進口物品與全國比較</p>
<p>（註）　單位千圓金單位</p>
<p>以上僅就每年在滬一埠之進口值即百萬金單位以上者而言。就此等進口均屬奢侈品和不合理之消耗品。惟如礦油·煤油，若用作燈油，則可以國產植物油代替。故亦在禁進之列。但其聽裝者未予禁止，因聽裝者爲小額消費者用，換言之，以家用爲大宗，故家用煤油，依理仍不該漲價。</p>
<p>若以每年在滬一埠之進口值在十萬金單位以上者而論，則種類尤夥，試列舉之。</p>

<p>（續八月十一日）　高劍農</p>
<p>也是間接受了他們的刺激和影響的。請看明末人寧波　星在崇楨十年——一六三七——著作的天工開物上的造「白糖」的法子：「……經冬老蔗，……榨汁入缸，……凝成黑沙，……用黃泥水淋下：其中黑渣入缸內，溜內　成白霜。最上一層，厚五寸許，潔白異常，名曰「洋糖」，下者稍黃褐」。他在洋糖二字下邊特自註釋說「西洋糖絕美，故名」這不是很明顯的一種受外國人影響的證據麽？他下邊又緊接著述說造「冰糖」的法子「造冰糖者，將洋糖煎化蛋青，澄去浮滓，候視火色，將新青竹破成篾片，寸斬撒入其中，經過一宵，即成天然冰塊。……我國精煉蔗糖的技術，到這時候才算得到有力的證明！</p>
<p>結論是：蔗糖在我國古時祇有帝王或貴官才有口福去偶而消受一下。就是到了　朝初　的時候，著名顯宦如同廉希憲——人稱廉孟子——似的，也因爲有病　要用沙糖作飲而不容易找到，有權奸阿合　送給他三斤「他終不以奸人所與求活也」而拒絕了，那麽祇有皇帝才能「聞而遺賜之」。可見蔗糖還不是一般平民所敢垂涎的。現在呢？蔗糖是那麽多是那麽價廉，以致人人可以染指可以享受了。</p>

<p>聽說，穿了西裝無異是帶了一張[優待券]，穿長衫却是帶的特許狀]。</p>
<p>的確，事實勝於雄辯，假使你西裝筆挺，相識者皆會笑容可掬地向你點頭招呼，甚至，不相識者也會對你投射一個羨慕的眼光，當然這種福份在穿藍布長衫的人們却沒有機會享受的。</p>
<p>並且，穿了西裝，你　可以向那些高樓大廈的建築物中去橫衝直撞，沒有人敢來攔住你，若是走進有五六層樓的公寓，大樓，或飯店中去，懶得走可以乘電梯，還有間訽時也得到許多便宜，否則他們先向你的藍布長衫上下打量一會。</p>
<p>開電梯的說：[喂!你腳生嗎？走走上去好了，搭啥豆腐架子！]</p>
<p>答復你的詢問人會陰陽怪氣，慢條斯理地說：[你自己睜開眼睛去找　好了，我又不是你雇用的。]</p>
<p>哼！西裝的優待，還有什麼話說。</p>
<p>假使你偶而替令堂或尊夫人提隻小菜籃子，或帶隻油瓶在街上走過，要是你穿的是西裝的話，就可以得到許多批評。</p>
<p>嘻，這人真滑稽，穿倒西裝裝，手中却拿隻　籃子。］</p>
<p>其實有什麼關係，不過人家當你出會一樣看待你，甚至於……</p>
<p>[屈死！］</p>
<p>再有，假使你喉嚨癢，或肚子餓，在攤子吃冷麵，除了那些異曲同工的評語外，更可以無助一時。</p>
<p>若是穿長衫那些就通行無助了，誰也不會來說你，原因呢？那是［特許］的。</p>
<p>所以穿西裝的無異是帶了一張［優待券］，穿長衫帶的就是［特許狀］。</p>
<p>不過，穿西裝也有一處有［特許］的效用，這唯一的［特許］（那當然不准長衫階級履行的）就是可以牽一隻狗。故凡是穿長衫的諸君，假使預備帶一隻動物（若是根本不想，那固然再好沒有了）出去散步的話，還是拖一隻［貓兒］奉陪吧！</p>

<p>火山裏噴出的泥土，據專家證明，都可以作為食料，這食料是在日本的火山坡下發見的。這種泥土是在地面下五英寸至一英寸深之處，味如　質；裏面還含有多量的營養分，能夠維持我們的生命很長久呢！</p>
<p>爪哇人取樹皮下的土　，煮了做食品。非洲人取那含有液體的白蟻生食；有時用油煎烤了吃。　　地方的人拿蟻卵做成一種糊漿，然後　以甜杏，而成為香氣撲鼻的美點。</p>
<p>在吾國廣東美國西南一帶，南美洲，澳洲等地吃蛇的人非常多，據說味兒很美；道或許大家知道。但，還有一種臭鼠，肉也可以吃，［阿根廷土人以臭鼠當做珍品，像我們視火腿的雞　一般］。一個甘薩斯大學教授會這樣說哩！</p>
<p>雷斯教授（Prof.A.MReese）會用撥土鼠和香鼠的肉作成各種肉食；吃的人不能辨出來。龍蛇和火蛇之類的東西，他也會試做過。（火蛇在墨西哥市上已成普通貨品）他又會將鱷魚切成肉片，據說是像牛肉一樣的味美。</p>
<p>這一些零零碎碎的紀述，很可見得將來的世界，人類真可以不必　食物原料的缺乏；因為那是［取之不盡，用之不竭］的呀！</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>愛情成熟，必須經歷結婚的階段，婚字歷史均作昏。白虎通云：［婚者，昏時成婚，故曰昏。］這種風俗，似乎中西出於一轍，因為結婚總是在下午將近黃昏時舉行，從沒有大清早大禮堂中奏落琴歌，雙雙好合的。還有一點也是中西不約而同；按我國舊例，之子于歸，臨上採轎，做父親的，須抱著女兒入與，諄諄的叮嚀幾句，西俗當婚禮的進行，也須由父親扶掖着，慢吞吞地，依戀不捨地，把女兒帶至禮堂上，其用意無非是做父親的費了十多年或二十多年的心思，　養兼施，如今告一段路了。那婚禮進行曲，在婚禮前的一關，那是孟登思宋所作，旋律莊嚴條貫如抗如墜，聽了令人飄飄欲仙。婚禮後的一關，那是華格阜所作，也是抑揚綿妙，徐吐清　。但是那時的賀客，紛紛的把彩紙花朵，擲向新夫婦的頭面，一陣的騷亂，不再注意旋律怎樣了。我國青年醉心歐化，結婚典禮，也用西方的婚禮進行曲。</p>

<p>如果是新的軟木塞，不妨在木塞中央用銀針穿一小孔，可免瓶膽半途碎裂，因為瓶中滿住沸水，時久漸冷，冷則水起收縮，這時木塞塞得水洩不通，它會把瓶膽缩碎的。</p>
<p>新買來的熱水瓶，未用之前，把它螺旋旋開，裏面如有硬拍紙則除去，以免水滲於內爛壞瓶　；裏面倘係白坯，可用牛油（機械上用的）遍搪於內，或者油漆；底上用洋釘替它　幾個洞眼，倘有水滲入時，亦不易生銹蝕爛，且有孔流出，螺旋叩上也用防銹油類鍍上，日後便於旋開檢視了。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 增修</p>
<p>汽車駕駛人大都以為車胎炸裂的時候，最安全的辦法是立即剎車，愈快愈好。有些駕駛人又相信這種辦法可以保全硬橡皮胎。</p>
<p>其實如此的救急方法，也許能保全橡皮胎，可以也許反而害了駕駛人的性命，因為駕駛人倘在那時立刻煞車，正幫助車身由於離心力的作用而翻到，豈不是貪小失大麼？駕駛人應該切記萬不可在輪胎炸裂的時候，慌張失措，以致一時情急，胡亂扳動煞車（制動機）正當的辦法是提高車行速率至每小時大約五英里；那時汽車最需要一種收縮力，駕駛人如能記住這種辦法，總能得到不可缺少的收縮力。第二步辦法就是漸漸煞車，這樣使能使車身穩定，在被控制的狀態下停住，不至於驟然傾覆了。</p>

<p>— 畏三</p>
<p>今夭是記者節，和兒童節，教師節一樣，我們也有這樣一　令節。怎樣來紀念呢？我想，我們不必幻想未來，應檢討過去，更須努力目前所堅守的崗位，大家靜默一下，作自我淸算，—這個我，是指報人全體，在今天允其必要；不是無意義的</p>
<p>檢討過去，無庸追溯得太遠，以最近四年多來說，民族全體，經過這樣一個大的磨折，許多新聞記者，會盡了應該盡的責任，這是值得驕傲的，如果撰述這時代的歷史，新聞記者的奮鬥，是不能　沒的。我們不必懷疑威武不能屈，富貴不能淫」的兩句老話，儘有事實來答覆，可以舉出某一個人或者某一件事情來解答這其中的精義。現在是秋天了，你如果去逛公園，你可以看見蒼松翠柏棵一棵的挺立着，在樹的下面，是許多落葉，「秋風起，黃葉飛，」秋風是掃落葉的，我們不願意做落葉，希望個個都是楨幹傲岸，卓爾不羣的松柏。</p>
<p>時代給我們磨鍊的機會，我們應得把握住時代，如果說遭受苦難，每個人都有份的，不定是新聞記者。然而我們站在社會的前面，就得盡了「站在前面」的責任，大家應抱定「卑之無甚高」的見解，做一點就　聚一點，蟻駝一粟，馬負千鈞，惟求一己之所安，惟盡一己之所能，各人在崗位上努力罷。</p>
<h3 id="c71">王雲五口中之　陸費伯鴻成功史 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>（香港通訊）陸費伯鴻先生追悼會，於八月十日下午三時在此地孔聖堂舉行，中華書局全體同人，留港參政員及先生親友，都親臨參加，各文化團體代表計數千人，追悼如儀，四時十五分於悲愴肅穆的情緒中散會。</p>
<p>會中致開會詞的是馬超俊先生，致祭後由王雲五先生報告伯鴻先生生平云：</p>
<p>「伯鴻先生幼時祇受五年母教，一年父教，一年師教，十七歲就獨力自修，十七歲在南昌創家學堂，十九歲創辦新學界書店於武昌。二十歲任漢口楚報主筆，因言論觸犯當局，致該報被迫停刊，轉至上海仟昌明書店經理，二十一歲入文明書局仟編輯，又二年為商務印書館出版部長及教育雜誌編輯……</p>
<p>「伯鴻先生的成功，除了少年時期的奮鬬以外，他的深遠的眼光也是一種要素。辛亥革命爆發，他料到滿淸必被推翻，民國即將成立，便集合同志籌備新教科書，以適合新的需要，於民國元年元旦創立中華書局，發行中華教枓書，風行一時……近五六年來，他料到我國法幣政策必然推行，於是注重鈔票的印刷，書局營業更能蒸蒸日上。先生在「新中華」創刊號中，復撰有備戰一文，認為我國對外戰事發生，必須長期作戰，因而主張就軍事民食交通三方面積極準備，其意見頗能與政府現在設施暗合。</p>
<p>「先生的優良性行在這裹也得提出：（一）强毅—他在中華書局草創時期，遭到不少困難，竟能堅持下去。（二）前進—他遇事不甘後人，他獨樹一幟後，在營業上和商務競爭極烈，商務本以教科書起家，其後出版範圍漸廣，伯鴻先生都不肯放過：商務印行四部叢刊，中華便輯印四部備要；商務糄印辭源，中華就出版辭……（三）專一—先生三十年來，主持中華書局，一心一志，不他務他求，他外間應酬極少，從前外交部請他做官也被婉謝。我國商塲常說：「同行如敵國」，商務和中華，在某時期也不免此種現象，但經過劇烈的正當競爭後，彼此認識因之較深，漸轉而為精誠的合作。在後幾年閒，我對於先生之誠懇態度的認識，也正如在以前對他所持的懷疑態度，簡直是一樣的程度。」</p>
<h3 id="c72">我是學徒我要補習 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 余仁</p>
<p>讀春秋欄中的「店員學徒如何進修」一文，頗為感動，我亦為一布號中之學徒，對於進修是何等地迫切？</p>
<p>在兩年前我還過著學校生活如今過那學徒生活，在社會上服務，感到種種學問的淺薄不夠，這是我感到萬分苦痛的，終於在痛苦中找到了出路，進人補習學校，不過在經濟上是必須由家庭來負擔。但是一個學徒的家中，大概是可以想像的。</p>
<p>我自入補校後，得到有許多的對於在職業校有幫助的學問，同時還可認識許多陌生同學；不過亦感到一種缺點，在補校中最大的毛病，是有頭無尾，在開學的一月中，濟濟一堂無一空位，甚至須加坐位，道種現象可說眞不乏有志靑年，然而一至學期結束的時候，在補校中上課的人們，大概可以知道補習的學生竟會寥若晨星。雖然有職業者，在業務上有種種的關係，但是亦不致於如此寥落，在我種種的探討下，得到了下面二個答案：</p>
<p>一進人補校，不須編級考試的手續，任意揷入，所以一般的靑年人，志氣高，自不量力地揷入比自己高深的一級中，試想他以後如何能接得上，所以他不發生興趣而中途輟學了。</p>
<p>一沒有決心地上學，隨意缺課，甚至不受的束地借了補習的名義，而到別的不正當地方去。</p>
<p>這當然並不一概而論，也許有一部份的人是受職業的影響，而中途輟學，我們是同情的原諒的，但是一般的任意地輟學缺席，是何等地痛惜，我們現在能够有機會進入補校求學，亦是萬幸，在這種社會上正還有成千成萬的沒有時間求學，而思深造的年輕學徒及店員理。現在申報推進店員學徒讀書運動，我們既然由此有機會讀書，那我們更應為自身努力，再推已及人為社會國家効力。（却酬）</p>

<p>「賭錢有那一個人不歡喜啊！他平時儘管不賭。逢到有人拉他去的時候，他也就的制不住了。……」梅寶已跨出了舍監室，張舍監還在裹面自言自語的說。使梅寶聽了，更比較安心了許多。而是那個來人的話，也說得非常合理。</p>

<p>時屆新秋，各里巷中，每見紙衣飄飄，冥鏹串串，夜則鼓鈸聲喧，螺鳴嗚嗚，僧衆諷誦，數時方休，名之曰蘭盆勝會。按蘭盆為梵文盂蘭盆之省，亦作烏藍婆拏，非意義之相殊，乃譯音之稍歧。盂蘭即烏藍，意為倒縣。婆祭為器皿，譯成漢文則為盆，而盆與婆拏之音，又可相切而成，故盆者可謂為音義兼譯也。</p>
<p>孟蘭盆會之緣起，即世俗所謂目蓮救母也。目蓮尊者，為弗弟子，見其母墮入餓鬼道，目蓮欲與之食，而其母餓火中燒，火自口出悉成焦炭，目蓮悲不自勝，乃求教於佛，佛為之說盂蘭盆經，盂蘭盆者，意即解救倒縣之器也。因命其於每年七月十五日盛設供具，以百種供物供養三寶，奉施過往佛佾，得救七世父母，故佛教中有盂蘭盆法會，以救先亡倒縣之苦。早年曾見麗雲甫演目蓮救母，口銜竹籤，上燃雙燭，意即為口中噴火也。目蓮之母，卒賴盂蘭盆會之力，超度於餓鬼道中。</p>
<p>盂蘭盆經之流入中國，為西晋時竺法護所譯，而盂蘭盆會之見於中國，已在梁武帝大同年間。佛教盛於中國，為六朝時，其時來說教譯經者，俱為西僧，稱之為道人，如稱覜世音菩薩為慈航道人，亦即此意。自符秦之後，始有中國人剃度為僧，僧者，佾伽黎之譯音也。然今之蘭盆勝會中所做之法事，則又為瑜伽燄口。瑜伽者，為密宗之總名。佛教之中，有顯密之分，顯者可求之於經論文字之中，即中國所流行之佛教是也。密者憑師傳授，持咒修法為事，即川藏所崇奉之黃教紅教是也。</p>

<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt (see photo) yesterday gathered five hundred neighbors at his villa here for the annual meeting of the Roosevelt Family Club. The President addressed the crowd, saying that the danger shaking the world has not yet passed, and may be more serious than at the end of August and the beginning of September 1939. However, we are still able to sit here peacefully, which is very gratifying. I believe we should all pray that we can say the same thing next year, he said.</p>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the danger of a world war now may be even more serious than when the war broke out. The President said that dictators are planning to conquer the world, including the Americas. He hopes that the United States can still maintain a neutral peace, but warned the nation that the decision of war and peace is not entirely in the hands of the United States. His remarks indicate that future aggression by dictatorial nations may force the United States to enter the war. It is reported that President Roosevelt made the speech to more than five hundred neighbors at the annual meeting of his family club. He read aloud a letter from an unknown female reporter, saying, "I know that the ambition to rule the world is so great that it includes the Americas." It is said that this female reporter is a shrewd traveler and observer.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, 31st – President Roosevelt delivered a Labor Day speech last night, calling on the American people to reaffirm their noble determination, saying in essence that workers, farmers, and employers must unite and stand firm in order to thoroughly defend our democratic system. No labor, no sacrifice, is too much, so that our cherished freedom and traditions can flourish for the benefit of the world. Labor and management must now understand the importance of the continuous production of national defense supplies. The production of these weapons and materials is needed for our own protection, and also for countries that resist countries that destroy the freedom and happiness of free people everywhere. We Americans should commemorate this Labor Day of 1941 with the most thoughtful and solemn spirit ever seen in the fifty-four-year history of Labor Day, and make people all over the world understand the happiness of democracy and freedom. The American people today have the great responsibility of preserving this democracy. We should exert our abilities in labor and sacrifice, as our ancestors did. We Americans should each fulfill our duties with full loyalty to this ideology, and it is appropriate to reaffirm our determination to undertake the current work on this Labor Day. It is believed that the US President's remarks are a prelude to a more detailed statement on international events on Monday.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 31st – Most people believe that President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe will reaffirm the US government's fixed policy toward the world and the Pacific. Although the content of Konoe's letter has not been made public, it is believed to be an attempt to repair the old relationship and to negotiate with the United States to adjust the situation in the Pacific.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Roosevelt-Nomura Talks Only Exploratory, Hull Says Not Yet at Negotiation Stage <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 31st – Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference yesterday that President Roosevelt's talks with Ambassador Nomura were only exploratory and could not be considered to have reached the negotiation stage. Hull reiterated that these talks have not gone beyond the exploratory stage. Later, in answering another question, Hull said that such talks are of an ordinary nature. When asked whether the United States is informing China, Britain, and other relevant countries of the situation of the US-Japan talks, Hull said that he could not comment on this matter because the US-Japan talks are purely exploratory. Well-informed sources said that rumors that the United States and Japan have reached a "basic understanding" are obviously premature.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 31st – London officially announced yesterday that the US government is informing the British government of the progress of the US-Japan talks, but whether the British government has learned the content of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's letter to US President Roosevelt, or whether its notification is limited to the talks between Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura and US President Roosevelt, has not been clarified.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 31st – Washington sources indicate that Japan is currently seeking to persuade the United States to relax its severe economic retaliation measures. In return, Japan may agree not to take further acts of aggression and guarantee that it will not attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that this is Japan's current goal, rather than a general solution to the Eastern question. To solve the Eastern question, the United States will have to demand that Japan withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 31st – The State Department is currently studying the special suggestions made in Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt to resolve the current Pacific disputes between the United States and Japan. However, the nature of the letter remains a mystery. Diplomatic circles in Washington believe that Japan is willing to make some small but important concessions in exchange for larger concessions from the United States. It is rumored that the US concessions include (1) restoring US-Japan trade, (2) relaxing the US freeze order, (3) the US, Britain, China, and the Dutch East Indies abandoning the encirclement of Japan, and (4) providing limited assistance to China and the Soviet Union through Haishenwai. It is believed that in exchange for the US concessions, Japan is willing to guarantee that it will not attack British, American, and Dutch East Indies interests in the South Pacific. It is rumored that Konoe's letter to Roosevelt has aroused great concern in distant countries. China and the Dutch East Indies are both afraid that if the United States shows any signs of appeasement toward Japan, the credibility of the democratic countries will be greatly damaged, and the safety of China, India, Thailand, and the Philippines will be seriously harmed.</p>
<p>Chinese Side Believes Japan is Pretending</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Chongqing, 30th – Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt has aroused great attention here, and there is much speculation about its content. However, Washington reports that after Nomura presents the letter, it is expected that he will continue to hold talks with President Roosevelt, so its content must have accepted the strong warnings of the United States and Britain to some extent. Observers familiar with the Japanese situation said that Konoe is also obsessed with the so-called New Order in East Asia, and it is unthinkable for him to make a 180-degree turn to break away from the Axis and abandon aggression. Even if he recognizes the great determination of the United States and Britain and understands the urgency of the crisis, he is willing to do so, but the domestic political environment does not allow it. If he forces it, it may lead to political riots. Therefore, it is speculated that the content of the letter should be full of sophistry, and further use empty words to perfunctorily, in order to buy time to wait for changes in the European war and make more adequate preparations. However, it is feared that Britain and the United States will not allow him to do so, and it is also feared that his domestic extremists will not be as patient as Konoe. As for the government authorities, they have not yet expressed their opinions, but they firmly believe that even if the Roosevelt-Nomura talks achieve anything, they will never be based on sacrificing China.</p>
<p>Tokyo Officials Maintain Strict Silence</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 31st – According to Japanese official sources, Prime Minister Konoe's letter to US President Roosevelt is phrased broadly and does not detail the existing problems between the two countries. The main value of the letter lies in its posture, and there is no need to expect the US President to reply. When dealing with extremely delicate international events, Japan maintains its goals of resolving the war against China and establishing lasting peace in the Far East. The temporary cabinet meeting on Friday considered the first telegram from Ambassador Nomura regarding the talks with the US President. Those responsible are currently maintaining strict silence about the content of the cabinet meeting, only saying that it is not yet possible to predict what progress has been made in US-Japan relations. As for the ultimate trend of the situation, it remains to be seen by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda. Observers believe that the Emperor's meeting with the Minister of the Army on the eve of Konoe's letter to the US President is very meaningful.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 31st – Japanese public opinion seems to believe that the British Embassy's announcement of the evacuation of British nationals is motivated by the desire to create another Far East crisis of terror, similar to the terror created mostly by the British side last spring. The reader's commentary clearly refers to the matter of Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt between the United States and Japan. The government is closely studying Nomura's report on his talks with President Roosevelt. Japan's future foreign policy may depend on this decisive negotiation. Government sources said that the Emperor is closely watching the developments. The content of President Roosevelt's reply to Konoe will be presented to the Emperor. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have stopped criticizing the United States in their commentaries. It is said that because there is a possibility of easing the tension between the United States and Japan, Germany frankly admits that Japan's foreign policy may be changing. German officials do not express optimism, but so far, the government's discussions remain strictly secret.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 31st – It was learned here this morning that Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt and detailed information on the international political situation will be discussed at a secret Japanese cabinet meeting this week. At that time, Konoe and Toyoda will present reports on this information.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Second Anniversary of the European War and Journalists' Day <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Today, September 1st, marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the European War, and also the second Chinese Journalists' Day. We are living in a time of great change and shoulder the responsibility of reporting. On this occasion, I would like to express my views and describe my own feelings.</p>
<p>Looking at the current world situation, it can be described as the most turbulent era in history in terms of scale and intensity of change. Since Germany invaded Poland on this day two years ago and the European War broke out, more than fifteen independent countries have been overthrown or lost their sovereignty, and more than twenty countries have been directly affected by the war. The three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa are all battlefields. Almost no place on the vast land has escaped the impact of the calamities of war. In terms of the number of participating countries, it may not be as many as the previous European War, but the intensity of the changes, the breadth of the spread, and the complexity of the related factors, as well as the severity of the losses and consumption, have fully demonstrated the characteristics of modern warfare, far beyond any previous war. However, after two years of evolution, although there have been many dangers and misfortunes during the period, the anti-aggression united front among the great powers has been completed, which was previously only a dream. The war aims of the democratic countries have also been clarified, and their enlightened wisdom is rare in past international documents. The invaders are increasingly showing signs of decline, and it is difficult for them to continue. And those who first destroyed world peace with violence ten years ago are now trying to open up a stalemate through negotiations. Their sincerity is undoubtedly doubtful, but their predicament is obvious to all. These are all brand-new hopes that are gradually growing in the midst of chaos and darkness, which could not have been imagined at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. But this does not mean that we should be optimistic about the situation and that the light is just around the corner. The recent meeting between Greece and Mexico, and the views it proclaimed, are diametrically opposed to the war aims announced by the democratic countries. They are still stubbornly adhering to their consistent illusion of conquest and control, and have no intention of repenting. It is likely that the more unfavorable their future encounters, the more eager they will be to succeed. President Roosevelt said the day before yesterday that the danger shaking the world has not yet passed, and may be more serious than at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. This warning is something that the world must deeply remember.</p>
<p>Now, let me express my feelings about Journalists' Day. Newspapers are a reflection of the times and also a driving force of the times. Horace Greeley, the greatest newspaperman in the United States in the 19th century, once said: "The task of a newspaper is to lead, to continue to lead." Because today's world affairs are complex and multifaceted, people in the world often feel lost. The progress of society and the development of public wisdom depend on the opinion of the public, based on a far-sighted understanding and clear propositions, clarifying right and wrong, and leading the people, so that they can become a trend and open up a new path for the times, not only to report correct news. Therefore, the contribution and function of newspapers to mankind can sometimes be comparable to those of great politicians and inventors. Let us prove it with the facts of recent years: helping China is unanimously called for by friendly countries, and the policy of appeasement is also jointly criticized by fair public opinion. Until recently, the former has finally been realized concretely because of the implementation of the US Lend-Lease Act, and the latter no longer exists in international diplomacy. Although the reasons are different, we cannot deny that sound public opinion has won a major victory in this regard. Some of the measures taken by the British government during the war often rely on the correct views of newspapers and public opinion, and can often achieve the effect of enhancing functions and making up for shortcomings. However, it is also because newspaper practitioners are extremely sensitive in distinguishing between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and have little room for hypocrisy. Therefore, they are deeply hated by those who commit aggression. In recent years, the violence has often been directed at the destruction of fair public opinion. In the occupied areas of Europe and Asia, the arduous struggle and touching experiences of journalists have been repeatedly reported in newspapers and by people. And in China, since the uprising to fight, the journalists who have unfortunately been martyred are the most numerous among the cultural people. The voices of freedom in Europe continue to come from the occupied countries under Nazi control. The journalists in some special areas of China are also overcoming all kinds of difficulties and risking their lives to firmly stand their ground and carry on the cause, one after another, to engage in the promotion of justice and the faithful reporting. Although the environment is difficult, and they have not been able to fulfill their ideals by even one-tenth, they have tried their best, and can perhaps plead innocent to their readers.</p>
<p>Today, the international situation is turbulent, and the task of journalists is even more important. We cannot know everything about the future, but we must do our best to fulfill our initial desire to serve the country and society. Such as how to suppress the strong and support justice, promote national consciousness, and guide the way of effort. In addition, the analysis of the future situation, the plan for post-war construction, and the maintenance of the welfare of the citizens and the implementation of social mutual assistance, as well as the cultivation of the spirit and the training of the will, are all the tasks that newspaper practitioners in this time and place should have, and also what we should encourage ourselves and each other on this Journalists' Day.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Eden Delivers Speech, Elaborates on Post-War Order, Eliminates Concepts of Hegemony in the East and West, Adjusts International Economic Relations, Asks British People to Sacrifice to Win Victory <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st – British Foreign Secretary Eden (see photo) said in a speech in Coventry yesterday that the eight-point declaration issued at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting has established the principles on which the post-war world will be built. This declaration is the charter of all free countries, and establishes the principle of equality for all countries, large and small. All concepts of hegemony and leadership areas, whether in the East or the West, are eliminated. The post-war world must have the cooperation of all of us. The meeting between the US President and the British Prime Minister in the Atlantic is not only a meeting between two great figures, nor is it only a connection between two great nations, nor is it only a way to defeat Nazism, but it is a declaration that we have both a war strategy and a peace plan. Europe and Germany now know that they must choose one of Hitler's new order and our new order. I said a few days ago that Britain's post-war policy towards Germany must have two goals: one is that Germany must be in a state where it cannot rise again to wage war and invade other countries, and the other is that Germany must not become a source of poison for its neighbors and the world due to economic bankruptcy. Today, I will go a step further and say that what is governed by these two basic principles should not only be limited to the post-war relations with Germany, but also extend to general international relations. This is the clear meaning of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration: First, no country must be in a position to wage aggressive war against its neighbors; second, economic relations must be adjusted so that no country will lose its proper economic position in the future due to unilateral trade methods that are exclusively implemented. Because political or economic imbalance will eventually cause disturbances. Without international security, there can be no individual security, and it is impossible to seek freedom from lack, jobs for all, or a standard of living that does not fall. Without economic security in all countries, there can be no international security, because war and disturbances are mostly caused by lack and loss. International security and economic security, though one in name, are in fact inseparable. But if Britain and other free countries do not always pay attention to the demands of peace, we will never have international security and economic security. There is one thing that I think must be given full attention, that is, when the war ended in 1918, we all had the idea that we could live in peace from now on. But today, we are more aware that we must watch over and maintain this peace, just as we must strive to win this peace. I hope that in the current work, the young people in the country who have participated in the war should each fulfill their responsibilities, so that the mistakes of the past will not be seen again in the future. I may as well briefly describe the current situation. Compared with fifteen months ago, there is indeed something exciting. At that time, we did not dare to hope that our fate would change so much. But today, if we comfort each other without striving, we will make a big mistake. The future still requires great efforts, especially in production, because the final result will depend on it. I ask the audience to make more efforts and continue to make sacrifices.</p>
<p>Either victory or defeat, either freedom or slavery, choose one of the two. There is no other choice. Life and death are at stake, and sacrifice is indispensable, and this sacrifice will not be in vain, because today we have good reason to hope that a happier world will finally come. Eden then announced the progress of the organization of Polish troops in the Soviet Union, and finally praised the achievements of Prime Minister Churchill, saying that there is no one else but Churchill who can undertake this important responsibility with indomitable perseverance.</p>

It stated that since the beginning of the arduous struggle, the power of news propaganda has been extremely great, and journalists across the country have been able to promote national policies and inspire people's hearts. As we celebrate Journalists' Day on September 1st, we hope that journalists will maintain their spirit of loyalty and service to the country, shoulder the responsibility of cultural guidance, and overcome difficulties together.

<h3 id="e18">Journey in the Southwest Skies (3) Hong Kong, Chongqing, Kunming, Lashio <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Roy is thirty-five years old. There are seven other American pilots flying this route, about the same age, mostly from Texas and California. Another pilot, Kent, from Louisiana, was killed the day before his thirty-seventh birthday.</p>
<p>Kent was serving on the Kunming-Lashio route when he received a warning that Japanese planes were attacking Kunming. (This decision was the same as our return trip, taking off in the afternoon. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes fly this route twice a week.) He landed at a temporary airport near Kunming, waiting for the Japanese planes to fly over this area. The temporary airport was already being bombed by five Japanese planes. There was no radio equipment there to warn Kent. After the Japanese planes dropped their bombs, they flew up into the clouds, preparing to leave. As the fifth Japanese plane followed the other four planes up, it discovered a CNAC plane preparing to land. It was a Douglas DC-2, clearly marked as a mail plane in Chinese and English, with large black characters painted on the silver wings and fuselage. The fifth Japanese plane followed the other four planes in a turn, passing through the clouds and diving down at the CNAC plane which was taxiing.</p>
<p>Kent was killed instantly, a bullet from a 20mm machine gun piercing his chest. He fell on the propeller. The co-pilot and radio operator climbed over the body to the cabin to notify the passengers to leave the plane quickly. They were too frightened to move, believing that this was a civilian airliner and that the plane itself was enough to protect them. The two men, a female flight attendant, and another passenger jumped out of the plane. The Chinese co-pilot and radio operator jumped to the ground and rolled out of the range of gunfire.</p>
<p>They saw the female flight attendant escaping from the plane. Her white nurse's uniform should have been very conspicuous on the dusty brown airfield. One of the Japanese planes also saw her and swooped down. She ran out of the plane, trying to hide under the trees, but a bullet hit her leg halfway there. After the Japanese plane circled up, it came back and fired two more shots. The young woman died eight hours after being injured, before she could be taken to the hospital. She was 25 years old, petite and beautiful, and had intended to resign from her job after this flight and live with her young husband, who was an engineer in Chongqing. The passenger who got off the plane with the three managed to crawl to safety after an attack. The co-pilot and radio operator either hadn't been killed or had escaped elsewhere; their whereabouts were unclear.</p>
<p>The other eleven passengers in the plane were machine-gunned and shot dead before they could leave the plane. CNAC stopped using female flight attendants after mid-April. If this accident hadn't happened, this female service wouldn't have been interrupted.</p>
<p>A Chinese friend said that those CNAC pilots are deeply in love with flying. This is true. They love flying, and flying here is different from flying in the United States. Everything is decided by themselves, and they are free people in the air. They earn a salary of one thousand yuan per month, but many people believe that the dangers of the journey cannot be compensated for by one thousand yuan. Some of them grew up in China. There are many foreigners in China who cannot leave, and when they find this country lovable, they start working for China. Therefore, this salary includes all hardships and dangers. As long as this job exists, they will never leave. During the war, it seemed that they had signed a contract. In January, they flew for 85 hours. In their spare time, they went to the movies and attended European-style banquets. One of them built small boats himself, and another was an amateur photographer. The town has good bars, but you can't drink too much. They don't value life very much. Three of them are married, one wife has returned to the United States, and the other two are about to return home.</p>
<p>We left Kunming at 6:30 in the morning, and the surrounding clouds were like white foam spewing out of a volcano. Passengers who weren't feeling sick were dozing off. Everyone considered this kind of weather the best for flying. In Chongqing, the passengers on our plane included a representative of President Roosevelt, three senior Chinese generals, and a US military attaché. This was a group of very important passengers. We had to wait for the weather to deteriorate before flying to Hong Kong, or we would have to plan to pass through the Japanese-occupied area in the dark. Every three days, this plane had to fly twice the distance from Chicago to San Francisco. This is an extraordinary journey, and since 1928, there have always been two such flights every week. From the Sino-Japanese War to the present, CNAC has flown a total of 12,090 miles per week, with only 37 accidents. Only two passengers were killed in total.</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation is organized in accordance with Chinese law and specializes in transporting passengers, mail, and goods to and from various parts of China. For everyone, this is China's third lifeline. The Burma Road is 1,400 miles long, leading from Lashio to Chongqing, and passes through winding mountain roads. Not counting accidents, it takes a week for trucks to transport heavy goods. The Sino-Soviet highway is 2,700 miles long in China, and trucks carrying aircraft parts and ammunition must bring their own gasoline, which takes at least six weeks. CNAC makes the round trip between the capital of Free China and the outside world in just three hours, so it is China's lifeline for ideas, money, and mail: the government cannot function without these three things.</p>
<p>Ten million legal tender dollars printed in England and the United States are flown to Chongqing every night, and the Red Cross's medical supplies are also flown in, while tungsten ore is shipped out to the United States to repay part of China's debt. Diplomatic documents are also transported by plane, such as reports from ambassadors of various countries and instructions from the Chinese government to overseas envoys. When Madame Chiang or ministers of various departments go to Hong Kong, CNAC flies them out. When envoys from various countries come to Chongqing to take up new posts, they also come by CNAC. This shortest route in China is managed by five American planes and eight pilots.</p>
<p>Although the weather is bad, the mountains are obstructive, there are no temporary airports for emergencies, no aviation signals, no very accurate weather reports, no de-icing equipment, etc., and although there is the possibility of being attacked by Japanese planes on the way, they continue to fly. It is no exaggeration to say that they are flying on the most dangerous commercial route in the world. Three hundred and fifty staff members, including clerks, airport workers, mechanics, radio operators, and pilots, are unanimously doing a great job for China. They have a strong and unyielding will, they will always continue to work, and no one can stop them. The Chinese know the value of CNAC. The Chinese are able to respect Americans, probably because on a route that is impossible to fly, there are American pilots willing to fly five silver planes for them. A China National Aviation Corporation flight attendant answers passenger inquiries about flights. This flight attendant, Miss Lu Meiyi, died near Kunming.</p>
<p>A CNAC plane landed badly, its nose plunging into the mud.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Battles Around Odessa Continue Fiercely; Red Army Counterattacks at Novgorod,阻遏 Germany's Advance on Leningrad <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 31st - Recent Soviet communiqués remain brief, stating only that fierce battles continued along the entire front on Saturday and Sunday, and that 66 enemy aircraft were shot down on August 27th.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - A dispatch from Moscow states that heavy fighting is ongoing around Odessa. German bombers attack the city daily, but the city has combat troops and anti-aircraft guns for defense, and the enemy aircraft have not achieved much effect. Enemy shells once landed in the city center, killing and injuring many women and children, their purpose obviously being to disrupt morale. However, Soviet aircraft quickly detected the enemy's artillery positions and destroyed them. The enemy aircraft's bombing is indiscriminate; factories and military zones have not been damaged, but one hospital and one theater have been hit, and some shells have struck civilian residences. All women and children needed for our defense are being evacuated to other locations under the protection of the Black Sea Soviet Fleet. However, the military and civilians alike show no sign of relaxing their determination to defend the city to the end. Two armored trains recently built by workers in the city are now in battle, successfully attacking German-held positions.</p>
<p>German forces are attempting to advance on Leningrad through the marshes to the north, but are encountering strong resistance everywhere, suffering heavy losses. Within the defense lines of the university city, there is extreme tranquility. Streetcars operate as usual from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM, restaurants are open for business, and the university is holding classes as usual after the summer vacation, with approximately 3,500 students enrolled. The school buildings are a thousand years old, and this year there are 700 new students. The continuation of studies shows the Soviet people's determination to resist to the end. At the same time, most residents are piling up obstacles everywhere under the guidance of military engineers, and building artillery and machine gun positions in the suburbs. Factories are repairing military vehicles and manufacturing war materials. Hitler's third offensive has gained nothing except for capturing some now-useless factories. According to Reuters' military correspondent, there is no definite news from the Gomel area, but according to recent war reports, the German forces have not made rapid progress in that area. The German goal is to cut off Kiev's communications. Even if the German claim of capturing Tallinn is true, it will not significantly impede Leningrad or hinder the operations of Soviet warships in the Gulf of Finland. However, the Soviet base at Hango will be more difficult to maintain. Currently, Soviet forces are counterattacking at Novgorod. If this move is successful, the Soviet forces will penetrate deep into the German forces in Latvia and Estonia, not only hindering the German advance on Leningrad but also putting the German army in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - Moscow Radio last night claimed that the enemy's price for capturing Gomel was over 80,000 soldiers killed or wounded, the loss of 200 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces, thousands of motor vehicles, and hundreds of aircraft.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 31st - British Wireless reported last night that Marshal Timoshenko's troops, after fiercely counterattacking along the front line, broke through the German defenses near Gomel.</p>
<p>German Military Spokesman Admits Difficulties Encountered in Attacking Leningrad</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 31st - A German radio military spokesman last night admitted the difficulties encountered by German forces on the Leningrad front, saying that in the past half-month, German forces, when fighting General Voroshilov's troops, not only encountered stubborn resistance but also had to cope with difficult terrain and heavily fortified defenses.</p>
<p>German Forces Advance South of the Dnieper River, Apparently Aiming to Occupy the City of Kakobov</p>
<p>United Press, London, 31st - The Soviet Union made no statements yesterday regarding the fighting in the Gomel region. It is widely believed that this indicates that although the Soviet advance is extremely slow, the area is still continuing to be developed. Authoritative sources said that the important battle south of Gomel is still inconclusive. The German attack here appears to be aimed at capturing Kakobov and destroying transportation east of the Dnieper River. Authoritative circles also stated that battles are fierce along the entire German-Soviet front. The Soviet Union is conducting small counterattacks in the north. German troops reportedly occupied Tallinn and Baltiyskiy. Authoritative circles stated that if this rumor is true, then the Soviet troops in Hango will have difficulty maintaining their stronghold because they will be subject to German flank attacks. Tallinn and Baltiyskiy could both serve as important bases for the German navy.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Denies the Fall of Tallinn; Military and Civilians Cooperate in Battle in That City</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 31st - A brief report last night stated that battles were fierce along the entire German-Soviet front, but did not indicate any changes in military positions. The report denied that German forces had occupied Tallinn and Baltiyskiy or the port of Oranienbaum. A special report from Tallinn stated that the city is still in Soviet hands and has repelled enemy troops. Leningrad continues to be attacked from the directions of Kingisepp, Volosovo, and Keksgolm. German forces have not made any progress anywhere in the past two days. News from Tallinn on Friday night detailed the situation of mobilizing to the last person, stating, "Everyone has resolved to die rather than let the city fall to the fascists." The news stated that men, women, and children are all willing to sacrifice themselves and work hard to help the Red Army and the fleet annihilate the enemy. Officials here stated that German forces attempted to set fire to the forests outside Moscow but were stopped by schoolchildren. Officials also stated that Leningrad is fighting for its life. Students are doing desk work for the soldiers and other guard duties, so the guards can continue to serve on duty day and night.</p>
<p>Finnish Communiqué States Soviet Troops Defending Vyborg, Every Street and House Fortified</p>
<p>United Press, Helsinki, 31st - The public here was extremely jubilant yesterday upon learning of the capture of Vyborg. Their pride was further boosted by reading the official announcement of the capture of Vyborg, as the capture has allowed Finland to recover most of the territory lost to the Soviet Union last year, the area being less than 20 kilometers from the old Finnish border. Vyborg was captured after a week of bloody battles, during which Soviet troops fortified every street and house in the city. Firing battles with machine guns and rifles took place from rooftops and in the middle of streets. Mines were laid under every building. Although Vyborg has not been completely reduced to rubble, it is riddled with holes and heavily damaged. The captured military supplies obtained by the Finnish army are said to be extremely large in quantity. According to yesterday's official communiqué, Finnish forces continued to advance after reaching the central front line of the Vuoksi River and have occupied Boulakoula, Alaempi, Ainavirvi, and Enkeli. Soviet forces resisted along the entire line west of the Vuoksi River but were ultimately defeated by the Finnish army, which then re-entered Vyborg and its surrounding areas. The city was surrounded by Finnish troops, and some even crossed into Vyborg. The Finnish encirclement of the city was further tightened. Soviet troops fought desperately and attempted to break out, but failed. The trapped Soviet troops included the entire 43rd Division and 115th Division, part of the 133rd Division, and some other units. On the morning of August 30th, Finnish troops entered Vyborg, while simultaneously forming a very deep wedge in the central part of the isthmus.</p>
<p>Hitler Congratulates Finnish President by Telegram; Finland Denies Talk of Peace Negotiations</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st - Hitler sent a telegram to the Finnish President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, congratulating them on the capture of Vyborg and saying that he would award the Iron Cross to General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 31st - Finnish sources deny rumors that Finland is preparing for peace negotiations. However, the Finnish newspaper Savon Sanomat states that as far as Finland is concerned, military actions may cease because Soviet troops have withdrawn from the old Finnish border.</p>
<p>United Press, Simla, 31st - A public announcement made here yesterday stated, "According to news from the Anglo-Soviet front in Iran, resistance in all areas has ceased. The areas occupied by our forces have quickly returned to normal." It also stated that Iran is extremely peaceful, and the British expatriates in the city have not been disturbed in any way.</p>
<p>Agence Havas, Tehran, 30th - It has been learned that a group of Soviet bombers bombed the city of Qazvin yesterday. The gasoline tanks belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company there were also destroyed, resulting in the loss of thousands of gallons of gasoline.</p>
<p>Reuters, Istanbul, 31st - Thirteen stateless women and one man, traveling for five days from the Iranian capital, arrived here this morning. Including this group, there have been a total of forty-one Germans approved to leave Iran this week. They are extremely concerned about the hundreds of German men still in Iran because the route of withdrawal has now been blocked. However, they believe that the British and Soviet military authorities will allow innocent women and children to leave the country safely.</p>
<p>Agence Havas, London, 30th - It has been learned that one of the conditions that Britain and the Soviet Union have put forward for resolving the Iranian issue stipulates that the country should provide guarantees to protect the oil wells of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and all national highways within its borders so that the Soviet Union can continuously receive overseas supplies through these roads. As for expelling German workers from the country, both Britain and the Soviet Union will also demand this. It can be asserted that the claim that the British military occupies the entire territory of Iran, or at least all its strategic points, has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Iranian Oil Tax</p>
<p>Can Still be Collected. United Press, London, 31st - Reliable sources said yesterday that the conditions of the United Kingdom to Iran may be proposed today. These conditions may include a guarantee that the King of Iran may levy oil taxes.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 31st - According to reports from Tehran, the British and Soviet troops invading Iran are advancing rapidly. The troops of the two countries met at east of Lake Urmia on Friday afternoon. The Turkish border is guarded by British and Turkish troops respectively.</p>
<p>Agence Havas, London, 31st - According to reliable sources here, the Soviet troops that entered Iran are now only 80 miles away from Tehran, the capital of Iran. Meanwhile, according to news from the Turkish capital, the situation in Tehran is extremely tense, and the authorities there have decided to implement martial law.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 31st - According to reports received here from Tehran, the new Iranian government has ordered the demobilization of the Iranian army. This matter is being supervised by the British and Soviet military commissions, and a large portion of the Iranian army will be disarmed.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Laval's Condition Not Yet Out of Danger <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 31st - According to yesterday night's communiqué, Laval's condition continues to improve. The German Ambassador Abetz and his wife visited Dieter in the hospital last night. His condition is reportedly good, but visitors are not allowed to enter. Laval was shot in the lung, but not in a vital spot, so there is no danger. Although his temperature is still high, the feared bronchial pneumonia has not occurred. Doctors hope to be able to treat it. A Vichy dispatch from the Swiss Basler Zeitung states that the bullet inside Laval's body is only one centimeter away from his heart and cannot be removed. It will be several days before we know for sure. Laval is 58 years old and not very strong. Dieter is stronger, but his injuries are more severe. Both have high temperatures, and it is uncertain whether they can escape danger. The trial of the assassin Colette is underway and has not yet resulted in a verdict. Many Swiss and French newspapers see this assassination as a symbol of a coming storm. The French newspaper Débats states that, based on history, assassinations are often the precursor to general unrest that can turn into a prairie fire.</p>
<p>International News Service, Vichy, 31st - Eight spies and communists, including a French Navy lieutenant commander, were executed in Paris yesterday. Paris newspapers stated that the assassin Colette claimed that he was not instructed by anyone and that the assassination of Laval was entirely his own idea. Laval's condition has worsened, and it is rumored that he is dying.</p>

<p>United Press, Berlin, 31st - Authoritative sources here said yesterday that Mussolini and Hitler, at their recent meeting on the Eastern Front, discussed how to eliminate British and American influence in Europe. This is one of the main points that the two leaders decided on in the Axis powers' program.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 31st - Goebbels said in the Italian newspapers yesterday that Hitler and Mussolini, at their recent meeting on the Eastern Front, decided that the war against the Soviet Union would end at the Ural Mountains. The Soviet Union in Asia would not be invaded. Goebbels stated that the Axis powers and their allies would occupy all of the Soviet Union in Europe.</p>
<p>TASS, Geneva, 31st - According to well-informed sources, Mussolini and Hitler discussed the Hungarian-Romanian relations during their meeting because the relationship between the two countries has worsened German-Italian relations. This is because Hungary is trying to expel the Romanians from northern Transylvania. Italy supports all of Hungary's demands. Italy not only agrees to Hungary expelling the Romanians from northern Transylvania, but also promised to give southern Transylvania and an area of Yugoslavia to the Hungarians, but Hungary must abandon its claim to Fiume as a condition of the exchange. In fact, the steps taken by Italy have not been approved by Germany, and there is a possibility that Italian-German relations will once again turn sour. It is speculated by various parties that Germany supports Romania against Hungary.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 31st - A dispatch from Ankara states that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, recently announced that he would soon return to Berlin to meet with Hitler. There are also rumors from Moscow that von Papen has been summoned back to his country, and the French Independent News Agency even stated that von Papen and his wife are scheduled to depart on Tuesday. Axis nationals in Istanbul expect there to be important economic developments between Germany and Turkey, with the first step being the establishment of shipping services between Istanbul and the Bulgarian port of Varna on the Black Sea by Germans.</p>

<p>European War Jottings</p>
<h3 id="e29">A Sketch of Three Key Figures in the British Cabinet <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Bevin never intended to serve as a Member of Parliament. He could have been elected as a member at any time in the past twenty years, but he preferred to keep a low profile, serving as the General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union. He disliked publicity, and even within the labor movement, he was unwilling to be close to the masses. Therefore, he was respected for his outstanding talent, possessed power, but was not popularly admired.</p>
<p>However, the very qualities that once made him unpopular transformed into virtues when he became Minister of Labour in the wartime cabinet. He forcefully rejected mediocrity and incompetence, showing no leniency. His strong temperament and serious demeanor were enough to reflect the determination of the workers. His hoarse voice and blunt language had made him one of the most effective broadcasters in the government. In times of crisis, people often feel uneasy hearing gentle voices and stale tunes. Speeches like Bevin's, concise and comprehensive, using language familiar to the people, resonated widely.</p>
<p>In 1920, he was already a union leader when he first fought against Churchill. At that time, Churchill advocated war against Russia, but the Action Committee opposed and stopped it. Now, the two key figures who are working together to save Britain were once political rivals!</p>
<p>Because the Labour Party is controlled by the unions, and the unions are controlled by Bevin, Bevin, although not a politician, wields great political power. However, despite devoting his life to the labor movement, few truly know Bevin. He certainly has a few close friends in the unions, but in the Labour Party, he is known but not famous. He is a superior figure, making him prone to arrogance. His strong personality, his control over the union masses, his logical critical abilities, and his ability to sway emotions make him one of the most formidable figures in the labor world.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Transport and General Workers' Union is largely due to Bevin's efforts, and his role as General Secretary has also given him tremendous power. Using the dockworkers' union as a foundation, he merged thirty-six small unions of similar nature into the General Workers' Union. He organized the union with perseverance. Today, the Transport and General Workers' Union has more than 650,000 members, making it the largest union in the world.</p>
<p>Yet, he is a union leader who dislikes strikes. He prefers long-term negotiations to reach a satisfactory solution, preferring compromise to coercion. This may be due to the disastrous defeat of the General Strike of 1926. In 1937, when King George VI held his coronation ceremony, London bus workers went on strike demanding improved treatment. Bevin refused to recognize the strike, refused to pay wages during the strike, and denounced the move as incited by the communists. He fought his own workers with harsh measures, and after four weeks, when the workers were forced to abandon the strike, he expelled the strike leaders from the union.</p>
<p>Bevin, once regarded as a powerful leader of the left wing in the labor movement, has now become the sworn enemy of the left wing. In recent years, it has often been said that Bevin is a dictator in the union movement, and anyone who dares to obstruct him will be dealt with mercilessly. Young workers complain that his early enthusiasm has changed to prudence and caution. Having built the world's largest union and seeing the great improvement in workers' treatment, he is satisfied with his life's work and unwilling to fight for them anymore.</p>
<p>However, there is no doubt that he will continue to fight to defend the labor movement he has painstakingly created. They know that his hatred of fascists is sincere. They know that he considers fascists to be the greatest enemy of the unions. He recently said, "A worker who can skillfully control a Spitfire can also skillfully manage a home." This shows that he has not forgotten his true self. Therefore, in July 1940, when he accepted unprecedented power in Britain, he was deeply trusted by the workers. He was appointed Minister of Labour, with full authority to manage the work of the nation. He has the power to decide which industries are essential and which are redundant for the war effort. He has the power to regulate working hours and workers' wages. He transferred tens of thousands of workers from ordinary industries to military industries. He frankly told the capitalists that wages should not be reduced, and also frankly told the workers that their responsibilities were no less than those of soldiers, and that they must see themselves as industrial soldiers.</p>
<p>He is determined not only to defeat Germany but also to transform Britain. Last October, in Bristol, he said, "The society that is finally established should be based on the broadest foundations. All the privileges we have known will henceforth be combined and reduced to nothing." In London in mid-October, he said, "Things can never be the same as before. The old era is over, and a new era must be built."</p>
<p>As for the gentle and smiling Herbert Morrison, he stands in stark contrast to the somber and serious Bevin. Morrison is the only person in the labor movement known by his Christian name. Even British men and women who have never met him often talk about this "Herbert." Even those who are indifferent to the labor movement will not ask, "Who is Herbert?" The most obscure members of the Labour Party feel a deep connection with him. The workers of London regard him as a friend. When he walks on the streets of London, policemen, newsboys, shop girls, and truck drivers shout, "Hello, Herbert!" This Herbert, hatless, carrying a briefcase, hurrying along, smiles and waves back with a twinkle in his one eye.</p>
<p>When London was devastated by air raids, civilian morale became an important issue in the war effort, and air raid shelters could not be built hastily. But if the post of minister responsible for air defense were given to a figure widely admired by the people of London, morale would be greatly boosted. Herbert Morrison was transferred from Minister of Supply to Minister of Home Security, a daunting task that only he could handle.

<h3 id="e30">Black Market Foreign Exchange About to Disappear, Legal Tender Value Strengthens, All Essential Goods to Be Settled with Foreign Exchange, Equalization Fund to Convene Meeting to Decide Everything <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Since the Equalization Fund began managing the Shanghai exchange market on the 18th of last month, and even more so after the black market listing was cancelled on the 29th, speculative activities in the black market have suffered a fatal blow and are expected to disappear soon. Moreover, the import of essential goods can be settled at a more favorable exchange rate. People's hearts have been cheered in recent days, and the price of legal tender has risen as black marketeers hold long positions. This has also been deeply felt on the Japanese side. It is expected that after the Hong Kong meeting, the loopholes in the freezing order will be completely blocked, so as to realize China's expected goal of economic warfare against Japan.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Value Will Continue to Rise According to the Japanese-language Riku Shinpo, in order to eliminate the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai, foreign banks in Shanghai will, according to the instructions of the Equalization Fund, stop all black market foreign exchange transactions from the 29th. By the 30th, because foreign banks still refused to trade, the price loosened slightly compared to the previous day. Later, as the international situation improved, the price rose again. The exchange rate for British pounds was 2 shillings 8.90625 pence, and for US dollars it was 4.96875 yuan, approaching the 3 shilling and 5 yuan marks. It is rumored that the Equalization Fund, in order to crack down on the Shanghai black market and control foreign exchange, will, when necessary, raise the current official exchange rate of 3 shillings 1.5625 pence against British pounds to 3 shillings 5 pence. This rumor was widely spread for a time, so it had a great reaction in the market. According to observations from the banking sector, the suspension of foreign exchange transactions by foreign banks does have a tendency to reduce the black market. Therefore, the legal tender seems to be on the rise. The call loan market on the 29th was temporarily suspended due to this influence.</p>
<p>Equalization Fund Meeting Will Still Be Held The second plenary meeting of the Equalization Fund will be held in Hong Kong. Dr. Taylor, the American assistant sent from Shanghai, Mr. Hawkins, the Taipan of Mercantile Bank, and Mr. Mackay, the Taipan of Citibank, are estimated to have arrived in Hong Kong. Although the official date of the meeting has not been announced, judging from Mr. Chen Guangfu's statement that "the work of the Equalization Fund will be reported in the newspapers early next week," the results will undoubtedly be known within three or four days. The most important decision of the meeting will be the supply of new foreign exchange at new prices, strictly limited to the essential goods approved by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the freezing of Chinese funds will be tightened to prevent speculation in the black market.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Import of Various Items According to inquiries from the Customs, the following is a list of items prohibited from import and items approved for import passed by the 477th decision meeting of the Executive Yuan: (A) The following goods are prohibited from import: (1) Goods from Japan and its colonies or mandated territories; (2) Goods manufactured by domestic factories that have been banned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs; (3) Products from the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe that have been designated as banned by the Ministry of Shipbuilding and Economics; (4) Goods prohibited from import in accordance with the Measures for Prohibiting Import of Goods during the Emergency Period; (5) Other goods specifically designated as prohibited from import. (All of the above goods are prohibited from entering the free zone. However, foreign exchange will not be supplied for those imported into Shanghai.)</p>
<p>Essential Goods Allowed to Be Imported</p>
<p>(B) Foreign goods not on the prohibited list are allowed to be imported. (C) The following items are allowed to be imported regardless of their origin: (1) Rice, wheat, coarse grains, wheat flour, and coarse grain flour; (2) Cotton and cotton yarn; (3) Steel and hardware materials; (4) Machinery and tools; (5) Transportation equipment and accessories; (6) Communication equipment and accessories; (7) Cement; (8) Gasoline and lubricating oil; (9) Medicines and medical equipment; (10) Chemical raw materials; (11) Agricultural insecticides; (12) Table salt; (13) Alcohol; (14) Hemp bags.

<p>After the announcement of the temporary suspension of receiving donations for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund from the 22nd of last month, it was originally hoped that readers would continue to donate during the winter vacation. However, people from all walks of life, enthusiastic about helping students, continued to send in donations as usual.

At 10 o'clock, the participants arrived one after another. In addition to over a hundred Dutch residents, there were also over a hundred British and American residents, as well as more than ten Chinese people. The flags of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were hung in the center of the hall. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the ceremony ended at 12 o'clock, Pastor Hertzberg gave a speech saying, "We pray that God in heaven, according to His merciful will, will keep our Queen healthy, so that the Dutch people can live and work in peace and contentment. In this time of national difficulties, we hope that God will grant us wisdom, patience, and courage, so that we can achieve national prosperity and peace.

<h3 id="e33">Japanese Intellectuals Hope to Avoid Conflict with the United States, The United States Argues That Japanese Troops Should Withdraw from China, But Japan Believes It Concerns Face <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Chicago Tribune's Tokyo correspondent reported on the 30th that Prime Minister Konoe of Japan, through Nomura, sent a handwritten letter to President Roosevelt, confirming that Japan not only wants to avoid conflict with the United States, but also wants to reach a "friendly understanding" and end all frequently occurring tensions. The Japanese side believes that this kind of tension is not beneficial to either Japan or the United States. Although the content of the letter and Nomura's talks with President Roosevelt have not been published, the fact proves that the talks will have "good hope." The trend of the talks is at least "constructive" rather than "destructive." The Japanese believe that what the United States really needs is for Japanese troops to withdraw from China, but they hope that President Roosevelt can understand that Japan cannot afford to lose face in this matter. The Japanese believe that the current situation is very serious, but knowledgeable politicians in Japan are making every effort to avoid conflict with the United States. At the same time, there are signs of hope, as can be seen below: (1) Tokyo stocks have risen to a record high today; (2) Hull's statement that President Roosevelt's talks with Nomura caused Japanese bonds in London and New York to rise sharply; (3) It is generally said that Ottawa is determined to send Major General Rudes to be the ambassador to Tokyo, to fill the position that has been vacant for three years, but the Canadian Embassy here expresses great doubt about this appointment.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Eight Hundred and Forty Foreign Nationals Evacuate from Japan to Shanghai, Including Twenty-Two Nationalities, with Jews Predominating, and American Officials and Soviet People Attracting the Most Attention <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese mail ship Tatsuta Maru arrived in Shanghai from Japan at 7:40 PM on the 30th and docked at the Waitan Wharf. The ship carried a total of 840 passengers, including foreign nationals of twenty-two nationalities. Affected by the freezing order, they are evacuating from Japan to Shanghai with their 627 family members.</p>
<p>The passengers represent twenty-two nationalities. Among these passengers, there are 349 Jews, 61 Americans, 48 Indians, 48 Germans, 30 British, 20 Canadians, 14 French, 9 Swiss, and foreign nationals from Chile, Norway, Brazil, Hungary, Italy, the Soviet Union, Portugal, South America, Egypt, Poland, etc. The majority are merchants, while others are missionaries and professors. Notably, there are 27 American military attachés and consulate officials, and 5 Soviets, attracting significant attention from various parties. Except for the Jews, the British and American people will transfer to American ships in Shanghai to return to their respective countries.</p>
<p>The ship drifted at sea for five days off the coast of America. When the ship arrived in San Francisco on July 25th, it did not dare to enter the port due to the influence of the freezing order. It drifted in the ocean outside the port for as long as five days. Subsequently, as a result of the talks between Nomura and Hull, the ship was finally allowed to enter the port of San Francisco on the 30th. According to the captain of the ship, Takahata Toichi, the situation at the time was as follows: "Our ship had 205 passengers heading to the United States. Just as the United States issued a freezing order, in order to avoid being arrested by the navy, we changed our sailing direction and drifted in the sea 200 nautical miles outside the port of San Francisco."</p>
<p>Although the ship entered the port, the cargo was seized. At that time, the American side paid close attention to the whereabouts of our ship. Newspapers speculated on the direction of our ship every day, and various newspaper offices mobilized aircraft to investigate the ship's whereabouts. Subsequently, as a result of the talks between Nomura and Hull, our ship was allowed to enter the port of San Francisco. However, the US Customs used illegal means to detain the cargo carried by our ship. The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce launched a fierce opposition movement against this measure, and Jews, Chinese, communists, etc. were seen on cars making anti-Japanese propaganda when our ship was docked in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Vegetables spoiled, and passengers were poisoned. Takahata then spoke about the poisoning of passengers on the ship when it returned to Japan. It is said that after our ship arrived in Los Angeles on the afternoon of the 30th, all Japanese and foreign nationals except the Jews were scheduled to disembark. However, they encountered considerable obstacles due to inspections, etc. At the same time, the crew's disembarkation was also monitored and restricted. Food, drinking water, fuel, etc. on board had to be approved before being brought in. As a result, a portion of the vegetables spoiled, leading to passenger poisoning incidents. This occurred one day before returning to Kobe.</p>
<p>The Cafiero ship carried overseas Chinese leaving Shanghai. Most of the American overseas Chinese who evacuated from Japan to Shanghai are waiting in Shanghai for the American transport ship USS Henderson to return home. However, some had already booked passage on the President Cafiero through their relatives and friends here to return home. The ship set sail south from Shanghai at 4:30 AM this morning, via Hong Kong, Manila, Colombo, Mumbai, Ceuta, taking the Cape of Good Hope route and circling back to the United States via the Atlantic. The ship only carried 35 American overseas Chinese for evacuation and 1,600 bags of mail destined for the United States.</p>

<p>The Press Strongly Supports Rectitude; Joint Telegram Sent to Chairman Chiang Expressing Respect</p>
<p>Today is September 1st, Journalists' Day. The Shanghai journalists did not hold any celebrations, and the newspaper offices and news agencies worked as usual without taking a holiday. However, considering the importance of the responsibilities of journalists during this time of national crisis, they resolved to uphold the spirit of unwavering loyalty, adhere to their positions, and strive to fulfill their duties to the fullest. At noon today, all journalists in the city will stand up in place and observe three minutes of silence to deeply mourn their colleagues who died in support of national policy after the Shanghai war. At the same time, members of the press jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the soldiers at the front, expressing their respect.</p>

<p>Guaranteeing Foreign Residents in the Hongqiao District, the Japanese Side Resolves Not to Emulate the Blockade of Tianjin</p>
<p>The Japanese side has imposed various traffic restrictions on Chinese people passing through the bridges in the Hongkou District north of the Suzhou Creek, which will be implemented indefinitely. Chinese drivers are not allowed to pass at any time. According to foreign sources, the Japanese side is still erecting barbed wire obstacles along Hongqiao and around St. John's University in the West Shanghai area. However, according to a letter received by the Hongqiao Foreign Residents Association, the Japanese side has resolved not to emulate Tianjin and restrict the food supply to foreign residents in Hongqiao, Shanghai. The Japanese side also stated that no changes will be made without sufficient prior notice.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Edible Oil Prices Repeatedly Rise; Strict Price Limits Imposed; Severe Punishment for Any Violations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In view of the recent repeated rises in the price of edible oil, which is clearly due to manipulation by speculators, the French Concession authorities in this city have taken emergency measures with the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Oil Cakes Trade Association, determining that the maximum market price for soybean oil in iron drums (measured by Sima weight) is 275 yuan per 100 catties, raw oil in iron drums (measured by Sima weight) is 272 yuan per 100 catties, and raw oil in bamboo baskets (measured by market weight) is 190 yuan per 100 catties. Any violations will be severely punished. It is also understood that according to recent investigations, the edible oil reserves are sufficient, and the supply has not been interrupted, so oil prices are expected to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Payments Begin for the National Salvation Bonds; Shanghai Agencies Handle Collections <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain the credit of national bonds, the Ministry of Finance has made timely payments of principal and interest on various public bonds issued during and before the war, and has never been overdue. If the designated tax revenues are insufficient to cover the payments, the Ministry of Finance will allocate funds from the national treasury to make up the difference, which are transferred to the Central Bank for special deposit in advance for payment. This has won the deep trust of bondholders. The issuance of new wartime bonds is particularly cautious in order to lighten the burden on the people. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications yesterday: (1) The eleventh installment of principal and interest on the 1936 National Recovery Bonds was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but due to the regular Sunday holiday, it has been postponed to today, and will be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have received telegrams from their head offices, instructing them to facilitate Shanghai bondholders by collecting payments on their behalf for transfer to the Chongqing head office. (2) For the first redemption of the 1933 National Salvation Bonds, the winning numbers are 312, 474, 691, and 935. Payments will be made by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank from August 31st. Due to the environment in Shanghai, payments will not be processed there for the time being. However, bondholders may entrust banks to collect payments from the four banks in Hong Kong, which will be paid in full in legal tender in one lump sum.</p>
<h3 id="e41">New Twists in Labor Dispute at Four Major Hotels <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Hua懋, Metropole and other four major hotels remains unresolved. The management representative, Mr. Li Pu Simen, insisted on dismissing a large number of employees, while the labor side consistently opposed it, resulting in a deadlock. In order to continue negotiations with the management, the labor side specially sent more than 20 representatives to the gates of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road and the Bund at 7:00 AM yesterday, intending to persuade the 100 or so room attendants who had not yet gone on strike to leave the hotel and join the strike immediately, in order to awaken the management and resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the management telegraphed the Public Concession Police, requesting that the police be dispatched to suppress them. After receiving the report, the police sent patrol cars to persuade the workers at the scene to disperse in order to quell the dispute. Although all the workers debated with the police, their actions were unavoidable, and they were eventually arrested. As for the 100 or so workers who had not yet gone on strike at the hotel, they left the hotel and went on strike separately after the incident. Therefore, the labor dispute at the four hotels has continued to deteriorate, and the future is difficult to predict. Currently, all the workers are actively planning to lodge a stronger protest with the management and hope for assistance from all sectors.</p>

<p>The New Stream Literature Series will be published. The first collection of the series, which is purely literary in nature, is scheduled to be published in mid-September. The contributors are well-known writers in the literary world, such as Zhu Wen, Luo Hong, Hu Shanyuan, Zhou Lengjia, Zhao Jingshen, Wen Zongshan, and Qian Jinxie, with novels and essays.

<p>The Shanghai Weekly is published. The Shanghai Weekly (Volume 4, Issue 10) was published the day before yesterday. The most eye-catching issues this week are the "US-Japan Negotiations" and the "Allied Forces Enter Iran." The newspaper has very insightful arguments and detailed analyses. It is truly a must-read for anyone concerned about current affairs. Other special articles are also written by famous writers. In addition, one translated manuscript is a recent work by Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor, Mr. Owen Lattimore, entitled "The United States Should Not Miss the Opportunity," which is a rare masterpiece. The number of pages in this issue has been increased, and each copy is still sold for 40 cents.</p>
<p>Practical and Simple Method for Calculating Foreign Exchange. Foreign exchange calculations are extremely complicated. There are several calculation tables published in the market, but it is still necessary to use multi-digit multiplication and division, which is very time-consuming with manual calculation, and also inconvenient with abacus calculation. Because Mr. Yang Du has long been engaged in calculation at the Commercial Press, he is skilled in calculating foreign exchange. He has been able to invent a novel method that replaces multiplication and division with addition and subtraction. Those who are used to using the abacus will find it very convenient. This method has now been compiled into a booklet and published, which is truly good news for people in the accounting industry. The price is two yuan per copy.</p>

<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Cheng Ji has given people a deep impression since holding a solo exhibition of watercolors at the Da Xin Gallery last November. We cannot but say that he is a young artist who excites us and fills us with hope.</p>
<p>At the same time, he has aroused the unanimous goodwill and praise of international figures. Pierre Flogny, in the French magazine La Revue Nationale Chinoise, wrote a special article to introduce him, praising him as a new discovery in the dull painting world, a strong seedling growing in the painting world of the New China.</p>
<p>Although our country has launched a new cultural movement, emerging painting is still in the process of brewing, and has not yet established its proper foundation to this day, and most writers have a significant tendency towards the French style of painting. However, although Cheng Ji is also influenced by contemporary writers, he is not confined to the Western tradition, but creates his own unique style with his superb talent. His quiet and enthusiastic, gentle and tenacious personality is close to the unique style of the Chinese nation. In his paintings, we appreciate the gentle and quiet tones, filled with the charm of poetry and music, which gives people the comfort of absorbing a warm breeze in the cold of early spring, and is like listening to the sound of reeds in the vast wilderness, which is far away, melodious, and full of the vitality and hope of life, symbolizing the great future of the New China. His strokes are free and easy, concise, and the use of water is moist and bold, which is where his skills are refined. Moreover, he has expanded his vision, and although he is confined to the narrow territory of the "isolated island," he expresses Shanghai as the theme, and takes all the dynamics of society as the subject matter, to enrich the content of his paintings, revealing his rich creativity and production desire.</p>
<p>Now, he will hold a solo exhibition of nearly 160 recent works at the Da Xin Gallery, which will last for 10 days from September 1st to the 10th. I hereby write a few words to introduce him. (Chongqing News Agency)</p>

<p>The finals of the Shanghai Open Swimming Championships were held on Saturday night at the Rowing Club. The most noteworthy of these was the men's 880-yard freestyle event. Ji Dixiu (formerly Jia), who had just won the 440-yard championship, led the way. When he finished swimming 440 yards, it took him only five minutes and twenty seconds, unofficially breaking the highest record for the 440-yard freestyle (five minutes and thirty-four seconds), and shortening it by as much as fourteen seconds. When two-thirds of the race had passed, Ji had already thrown off Stephen, who was in second place, by a hundred yards. As a result, Ji won the championship with a time of eleven minutes and fifty-four and six-tenths seconds, breaking Smith's Shanghai record of twelve minutes and five and six-tenths seconds in 1936, which is very commendable. Hai Jin defended his championship in the 100-yard freestyle, with a result of 59.8 seconds, which was not outstanding. Smith won the 100-yard backstroke, and Burt dominated the elementary 100-yard freestyle effortlessly. The final finals will be held this Saturday at the West Qing Swimming Pool. Registration closed yesterday. There are five events for men and women, with a total of 34 participants. Chinese general Wen Jingling participated in the men's 50-yard freestyle, Lin Meiling joined the women's 50-yard freestyle, and diving star Zai Anxiang participated in the men's fancy diving.

<p>All-Blacks Team's Behavior Unsportsmanlike; Friendship Star Women's Volleyball Wins Championship</p>
<p>The charity basketball and volleyball tournament held by the Disaster Relief Children's Home commenced its fourth and final match yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Guoliang Middle School field on Avenue Edward VII. The first match was a battle for the volleyball championship between Friendship Star and Shanghai Star. The absence of Shanghai Star's main player, Zhuo Xianglai, impacted their strength. Although only eight players competed, they fought valiantly, posing a significant threat to Friendship Star. Ultimately, Friendship Star narrowly won 2-0, claiming the volleyball championship. After the match, a volleyball was auctioned off, with Huang Mingyuan of Friendship Star representing Ms. Xing Ruiqi, winning with a bid of 500 yuan. The basketball was also auctioned off, with Xie Yiqin representing Li Zulai, winning with a bid of 500 yuan. Yesterday's total proceeds amounted to 1,226 yuan, all of which were donated to the orphanage. In the basketball game, amidst enthusiastic cheers from the audience, Blue and White defeated All-Blacks 31-25, securing the basketball championship.</p>
<p>Exciting Match Abruptly Ends</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Blue and White took the lead, with Zude scoring the first basket, establishing a 6-2 lead. All-Blacks substituted Wang Jinghu for Dong Yangfeng, which proved effective, and Kong Guangyi's entry narrowed the score to 9-10. After a prolonged struggle, Blue and White narrowly led 14-11 at halftime. Resuming the game, Blue and White further extended their lead to 19-14. Shaoqing bravely led the charge, scoring two baskets, and Youliang also made a contribution, tying the score at 24-24. Blue and White called a timeout. Chen Bangzhen and Li Zude scored consecutive points through free throws, gaining six points. Blue and White's momentum surged. With only one minute and eight seconds remaining, several players from the All-Blacks team behaved improperly, surrounding Bao Songyuan of Blue and White and assaulting him, causing a major uproar. The exciting game ended abruptly, to much regret. Ultimately, Blue and White defeated All-Blacks 31-25, concluding the three-game series with three victories and winning the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Impact of Prohibited Imports on the Shanghai Market <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Haibo</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, our country gradually adopted measures to manage trade. For example, the regulations regarding prohibited imports, upon which the Stabilization Fund relies when providing foreign exchange today, were promulgated and implemented on July 4th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). However, due to Shanghai's unique circumstances, it became an isolated island after falling into enemy hands. All national laws and regulations enacted during the war could not be implemented in Shanghai. This loophole ultimately undermined the effectiveness of our country's entire wartime economic control mechanism.</p>
<p>Recently, the United States government, at our country's request, froze all US dollar funds belonging to Chinese citizens. To maintain China's reasonable foreign trade in the future, the supply and demand of US dollars will be handled centrally by designated banks (initially, the fourteen Allied banks in Shanghai and our country's three national banks, namely the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, were designated. After consultation between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, it was changed to nine Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai designated by the Exchange Stabilization Fund). Initially, the US Treasury Department's freezing decree was extremely vague; the criteria for supplying exchange were extremely broad. As a result, each bank continued to supply exchange based on its own interpretation. At the same time, there was no unified supervisory body to regulate them. For a time, the steps taken by each bank were greatly confused, eventually forming a peculiar situation of freezing without actually freezing. The exchange market was agitated as a result, and speculation intensified; exchange rates became extremely tight, and special rates soared. Legitimate merchants and the entire society and people's livelihood suffered as a result. Subsequently, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed on the future supply of foreign exchange. The task was still entrusted to the Sino-American-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, which was established earlier, to carry out stabilization operations and to be responsible for supervision. At the same time, the authority to unfreeze all Chinese funds in the United States was uniformly entrusted to the Central Bank of China. On the one hand, the Stabilization Fund designated nine banks to handle the legal supply of exchange, and clearly announced that all future exchange supplies must be handled in accordance with the regulations on prohibited imports promulgated in early July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Exchange will not be supplied for goods that are prohibited from import. Even for free goods that can be imported, the import need must go through review procedures. Although there are currently no explicit regulations regarding the standards for this review, it is generally expected that they will be handled in accordance with the US Treasury Department's notes No. 58 and 59. The main points of these notes are two: (1) Only commercial enterprises that were genuinely engaged in business in China early on have the right to apply for foreign exchange supply. Impersonation and substitution are not allowed. (2) The amount of exchange applied for must be equal to the value of the imported goods. The exchange obtained through the application must not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>With this adjustment, the scope of exchange supply and demand became clear, the criteria for reviewing supply and demand were determined, and the Sino-American-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's unified supervision and effective balancing came into play. The chaotic situation in the current exchange market was thus clarified. In the future, the order of the exchange market should be restored, and exchange rates should be stabilized, so the wind of speculation can be contained. As a result, the doubts of the general public about the future of the exchange market can now be dispelled. However, because Shanghai has been exempt from the law for several years, and import trade has always been free, it will now have to be subject to the restrictions of the regulations on prohibited imports. Free imports that are not prohibited will also be subject to invisible management in the exchange application and supply system in the future. Therefore, they have all raised their deep concerns about the future of the Shanghai market. This is a common psychological change whenever a new policy is implemented and all parties are not yet clear about it. However, whether it is the case, and what the ultimate impact will be, is also worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The Current State of Trade Management Since the outbreak of the war, our country's trade policy has undergone changes. Truly, balancing international payments is fundamental to a country's economy. However, during the hot period of the war, the situation varied at different times, and trade often tended towards a deficit. It is especially necessary to revise the direction at any time, maintain balance, so that it does not affect the social economy. Judging from the traces it has gone through, it can be roughly divided into four periods. Before the implementation of the foreign exchange review system in early March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), import and export trade was purely free, but for military purposes, some ports were closed, or the export of certain goods was prohibited. This was the first period. Then, until July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), due to the establishment of the foreign exchange review system, the government began to manage a small portion of import and export trade. Without application and approval, import and export were not allowed by law. This can be called the embryonic period of trade management. This was the second period. Since the promulgation of the "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods During the Emergency Period" (which is now cited by the Stabilization Fund as the standard for reviewing foreign exchange applications) and the "Regulations on Applying for Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods," "Measures for Settling Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Differences for Exported Goods," etc., in July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), until today, import and export trade has begun to enter the stage of restricting imports and encouraging exports. However, as mentioned earlier, due to the existence of the Shanghai free market, foreign exchange could be freely bought and sold, and import trade refused to be bound by national law. The war did not change Shanghai's dominant position in the national economy. On the contrary, due to the concentration of refugees and the concentration of floating capital, Shanghai's financial power expanded relatively; the changes in the local market had a particularly strong impact on the potential power of the whole country. The state's trade management law could not be implemented in Shanghai, so the elaborately planned trade management organization ultimately became a mere formality. Unfortunately, all control orders became empty words. This was the third period.</p>
<p>The failure of past trade management, like the failure of exchange control, was due to extremely complex reasons, but the lack of effective cooperation from the United Kingdom and the United States was undoubtedly one of the main reasons. Today, since the United Kingdom and the United States have successively cooperated with us in stabilizing exchange, and further agreed to the Chinese government's request to freeze Chinese funds and agree to use the above-mentioned "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods" promulgated by China as the standard for determining exchange supply, the trade management organization arranged in the past should be able to see its effective implementation from now on. Although there are still many difficulties in its future. But in terms of the development of China's trade policy history, it is currently entering a period of strengthening, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>In terms of the current trade management system in our country, its main points are roughly four:</p>
<p>(1) All import and export trade must be carried out in accordance with the law, and private transactions are not allowed.</p>
<p>(2) For export trade, those designated by the government as state-owned should be state-owned. For privately operated businesses, they must first settle their export exchange with government banks. Otherwise, export is not allowed.</p>
<p>(3) For import trade, exchange will be denied for those prohibited from import by the government. All exchange needed by importers will be supplied by the nine banks designated by the Stabilization Fund. Before supply, procedures such as application and review must be carried out; once approved for supply, it can be sold at the exchange rate set by the Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>(4) It is also forbidden to report for transit for goods that are prohibited from import. If adjusting the market price in the rear, or supplying for other uses, or there are other legitimate reasons, those who have been approved by government agencies may have the Ministry of Finance investigate and consider the actual needs, and issue a special permit to purchase and transport prohibited import goods, and then allow them to be imported.</p>
<p>It can be seen that our country's trade control is technically dominated by exchange management. That is, trade management is implemented through exchange management. Therefore, its success or failure still depends on whether the black market for foreign exchange can be eliminated. If the black market for foreign exchange is not eliminated, then imports that are not approved can still be sought in the black market. However, the import exchange rate obtained in the black market will be more expensive than that obtained in the legal market. Therefore, the import price will also be expensive. Although this method cannot make all import trade be handled entirely according to the government's intention. However, due to the impact of the black exchange price on its import price, it can invisibly achieve some inhibitory effect. As for those who directly impose trade control techniques on trade itself, only the implementation of the regulations on prohibited import goods is more noteworthy. Because all goods that are prohibited from import will not only be unable to obtain legal exchange in the future, but also will not be able to pass through customs. Even if the customs in the occupied area can pass, it will be impossible to transport it to the interior. For this reason, the market for all goods within the scope of prohibited import must be the first to be affected.</p>
<p>Goods Prohibited from Import The purpose of wartime trade management is, on the import side: (1) to shift non-urgent and unnecessary imports to wartime urgent imports; (2) to adjust international payments to ensure the stability of the currency's external purchasing power; (3) to cultivate the good habits of national thrift; (4) to exert the effect of economic warfare, to pressure the export trade of the opposing country; (5) to encourage the revitalization of the domestic substitute industry. In order to enrich the people's livelihood. The "Regulations on Prohibited Import Goods During the Emergency Period" promulgated in early July of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) were formulated in accordance with these meanings. The prohibited scope, as reported by various newspapers, is 16 categories. Checking its content, categories 5, 8, 13, and 15 are missing. The prohibited tariff item numbers, as reported by various newspapers, are 234 items. Checking its content, there are only 168 items. Tariff No. 624, tiles and bricks, were also originally listed as prohibited, but were removed during the amendment of the law; so there are actually only 167 items. If we analyze the types of these prohibited goods, they can be roughly divided into (1) luxury goods, or non-urgent and unnecessary goods; (2) goods for which the opposing country is the main importing country, and for which alternative goods can be found domestically or in a third country; (3) countries that do have substitute goods that can offset import needs. Starting with the purpose and nature of each item, the original table can be re-listed as:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton and its products: Prohibited Nos. 77 and 80.</p>
<p>(2) Hemp and its products: Prohibited No. 102, one type.</p>
<p>(3) Wool and its products: Prohibited Nos. 115, 116, 120, 122, 125, 126, six types.</p>
<p>(4) Silk and its products: Prohibited Nos. 129 to 145, eleven types.</p>
<p>(5) Fish, shellfish, and seafood: Prohibited Nos. 275 to 283, 286 to 287, 289 to 297, twenty types in total.</p>
<p>(6) Meat and food products: Prohibited Nos. 300, 302, 303, 314, 316, 318, 321, 328, 330, nine types in total.</p>
<p>(7) Fruits, dried fruits, and their products: Prohibited Nos. 299, 304, 312 to 313, 315, 317, 319, 329, 332, 333, 336, 351, 353 to 355, 360, 364, 366 to 371, 375 to 377, 379 to 382, 389, 392 to 394, thirty-four types in total.</p>
<p>(8) Sugar: Prohibited Nos. 398 to 401, three types in total.</p>
<p>(9) Wine and other beverages: Prohibited Nos. 403 to 419, seventeen types in total.</p>
<p>(10) Tobacco: Prohibited Nos. 420 to 425, five types in total.</p>
<p>(11) Mineral oils: Prohibited Nos. 520 and 532, two types in total.</p>
<p>(12) Paper: Prohibited Nos. 545 to 547, 549, 550, 554, and 557, seven types in total.</p>
<p>(13) Animal hides: Prohibited Nos. 566 to 568, three types in total.</p>
<p>(14) Feathers: Prohibited Nos. 572 to 573, two types in total.</p>
<p>(15) Animal bones and horns: Prohibited Nos. 574, 576, 579, three types in total.</p>
<p>(16) Wood and its products: Prohibited Nos. 589, 600 to 601, three types in total.</p>
<p>(17) Palm, bamboo, grass, and their products: Prohibited Nos. 592, 593, 595, 596, 598, five types in total.</p>
<p>(18) Porcelain and enameled porcelain: Prohibited Nos. 608 and 609, two types.</p>
<p>(19) Glass and its products: Prohibited Nos. 610 to 612, 614, 616, six types in total.</p>
<p>(20) Jewelry, ornaments, and cosmetics: Prohibited Nos. 627, 645, 650, 653, 655, 658, 667, seven types in total.</p>
<p>(21) Antiques, works of art, and decorations: Prohibited Nos. 633, 634, 635, 671, four types in total.</p>
<p>(22) Musical instruments and toys: Prohibited Nos. 641, 652, 668, three types in total.</p>
<p>(23) Sundries: Prohibited Nos. 638, 666, 669, 670, four types in total.</p>
<p>Looking at the prohibited goods, they are either non-urgent and unnecessary, or they are the main products of the opposing country, or there are domestic substitutes. If they can be effectively prohibited, then based on the actual import situation in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it is estimated that more than 230 million yuan can be saved, which is equivalent to about 68 million US dollars and 13 million British pounds. Once this huge amount of foreign exchange expenditure is saved, it can be transferred to the import of urgently needed materials. For our country, it is only a change in the use of foreign exchange; for other countries, it is only a conversion of their exported goods; in essence, the statistics on their trade with China will not be affected. However, the great impact on Shanghai's consumer market is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Prohibition and Shanghai Commerce The annual import volume of the 167 tariff items that are currently prohibited from import has always been Shanghai as its largest consumer port. Although the commodity numbers in the monthly trade statistics published by the customs are different from the tariff numbers, using their specially compiled statistical numbers, it is not easy to calculate the most recent trade volume imported into Shanghai. However, by using the tariff numbers and statistical numbers in the trade statistics yearbook of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), it can be seen that Shanghai accounts for 70 to 80% of the total import of these non-urgent, unnecessary, and even luxury goods nationwide. If you want to list them one by one, the length of this article does not allow it. Let’s take a look at those whose annual import volume in Shanghai is more than 1 million customs gold units. The import value in the 28th year of the Republic (1939) is compared with the national import value at the same time as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Comparison of Prohibited Import Goods with Annual Import Value of More Than 1 Million Customs Gold Units in Shanghai with the Whole Country</p>
<p>(Note) Unit: Thousand Gold Units</p>
<p>The above only refers to those whose import value in Shanghai is more than one million gold units. These imports are all luxury goods and unreasonable consumables. However, if mineral oil and kerosene are used as lamp oil, they can be replaced by domestic vegetable oil. Therefore, they are also on the list of prohibited imports. However, those in cans are not prohibited, because those in cans are for small consumers, in other words, for household use, so household kerosene should not rise in price.</p>
<p>If we consider those whose annual import value in Shanghai is more than 100,000 gold units, there are even more types. Let’s list them.</p>
<p>Prohibited Import Goods with Annual Import Value of More Than 100,000 Customs Gold Units in Shanghai and their Tariff Numbers</p>
<p>Tariff Number (Name of Prohibited Import Goods, their Use, and Whether There are Substitutes)</p>
<p>120 Pure wool or mixed wool clippings and returns (Luxury, with substitutes)</p>

<p>414 Whiskey (Luxury)</p>
<p>418 Sweet wine (Luxury)</p>
<p>420 Cigarettes (Luxury, with substitutes)</p>
<p>423 Tobacco leaves (With substitutes)</p>
<p>425 Tobacco stems, tobacco dust, shredded tobacco, waste tobacco (With substitutes)</p>
<p>520 Mineral oil (With substitutes)</p>
<p>532 Kerosene (With substitutes)</p>
<p>546 Red cigarette paper (With substitutes)</p>
<p>547 Waxed paper (With substitutes)</p>
<p>549 Drawing paper, document paper, bond paper, banknote paper (With substitutes)</p>
<p>554 High-quality parchment paper (With substitutes)</p>

<p>609 Enameled porcelain (With substitutes)</p>
<p>612 Unlisted glass sheets (With substitutes)</p>
<p>615 Glassware (With substitutes)</p>
<p>641 Gramophones and their parts (Luxury)</p>
<p>655 Perfume and cosmetics (Luxury)</p>
<p>667 Cosmetic appliances (Luxury)</p>
<p>668 Toys and games (Luxury, with substitutes)</p>
<p>Looking at the above goods, they are nothing more than silk and wool products, seafood, candies, table sugar, Western wines, tobacco, high-quality paper, high-quality wood, medicines, cosmetics, toys, etc., either absolutely luxurious, or although some are necessary, there are domestic products that can be substituted. However, about 100 million yuan is spent on these every year. The saving of this 100 million yuan can at least increase Shanghai's necessary import volume by half to one times its current volume. At the same time, it can also enable domestic substitute producers to increase their turnover by several tens of percent to one times or even several times. Not only can Shanghai's necessary goods market be stabilized, but it can also enable domestic producers to obtain an opportunity to develop their business. However, because these goods cannot be imported, it is not unexpected that the speculation and manipulation of their inventory market will follow, and even attempts to buy black exchange and engage in smuggling.</p>

<p>The New York cotton market is firm and stable. The weather report is good, but the New Orleans cotton market rose, and news of revised cotton prices from Washington came. As a result, both futures and spot prices rose by 13 to 20 points, more or less.</p>
<p>Washington Electric: The US Department of Commerce Statistics Bureau issued the second US cotton ginning report. The original telegram is recorded on the left (unit: one bale, each bale 500 pounds)</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, and then rose slightly due to short covering and purchases by speculators, and finally rose again due to early signs of weather in the cotton area. As a result, the prices of various brands fell by one rupee and 25 to one rupee and 75 more or less than the previous day.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that today's opening price of Indian cotton will be high by two and a half rupees.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Cigarettes Rise Sharply and Fall Rapidly; Daily Necessities Also Fall <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market rose and fell sharply. It is heard that the factories are distributing goods, and there will be a distribution soon. As a result, people are becoming more and more tired. Stockpilers inside and outside the industry are seeking to get out. There are few buyers, and transactions are mainly for door-to-door sales, so the price has fallen sharply. The price of Great Britain brand has fallen to 2,190 yuan per box, Old Knife brand to 1,910 yuan, Five China brand to 1,220 yuan, Small Fairy brand to 1,460 yuan, and Pinhai brand to 1,550 yuan. The buying price has generally fallen by several hundred yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>The market conditions for daily necessities have also declined amidst the trend of falling prices. It is said that a certain atmosphere is quite strong in the market, which has caused people from all sides to become soft and tired, and most of them are stopping advances and retreating. Therefore, the buying price has generally fallen slightly. Gu Ben soap is 62 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap is 52 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao soap is 47 yuan, which is one or two yuan less than the previous day. Beautiful brand matches are 980 yuan per box, and Phoenix brand is 940 yuan, which is a sharp drop of more than 100 yuan compared to the highest price. Sailboat brand candles are 36 yuan and 5 jiao per box, which is also slightly 2 yuan less. Sellers have difficulty selling, because buyers are temporarily watching. The market will inevitably fall again.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Sugar Cane and Cane Sugar (Part of China) (6) <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from August 11th) Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>They were also indirectly stimulated and influenced by them. Please see the method for making "white sugar" in *Tiangong Kaiwu*, written by the late Ming Dynasty Ningbo native Song Yingxing in the tenth year of Chongzhen (1637): "...After winter, old sugar cane,... squeeze the juice into a vat,... it condenses into black sand,... then wash it down with yellow mud water: The black dregs enter the vat, and inside it, white frost forms. The top layer, about five inches thick, is exceptionally pure white, called "foreign sugar"; the lower layers are slightly yellowish-brown." He specifically annotates below the words "foreign sugar," saying, "Western sugar is exceptionally beautiful, hence the name." Isn't this clear evidence of influence from foreigners? He then immediately describes the method for making "rock sugar": "To make rock sugar, melt foreign sugar with egg white, remove the floating impurities, and observe the color of the fire. Break fresh green bamboo into thin strips, chop them into inch-long pieces and scatter them into the mixture. After a night, it naturally forms ice blocks... Our country's refining technology for cane sugar can be considered powerfully proven at this time!"</p>
<p>The conclusion is: In ancient China, only emperors or high-ranking officials had the privilege of occasionally enjoying cane sugar. Even in the early Qing Dynasty, famous and prominent officials like Lian Xixian—known as Lian Mencius—were unable to easily find granulated sugar for medicinal purposes. The powerful traitor Ahe offered him three catties, but he refused, saying, "He would not seek survival through what was given by a treacherous person." Only the emperor could "hear of it and bestow it as a gift." This shows that cane sugar was not something ordinary people dared to desire. But now? Cane sugar is so plentiful and so cheap that everyone can touch it and enjoy it.</p>

<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>I heard that wearing a Western suit is like carrying a [preferential ticket], while wearing a traditional long gown is like carrying a special permit].</p>
<p>Indeed, actions speak louder than words. If you are neatly dressed in a Western suit, acquaintances will smile and nod to you, and even strangers will cast admiring glances at you. Of course, those who wear blue cloth long gowns do not have the opportunity to enjoy such blessings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, wearing a Western suit allows you to barge into those tall buildings without anyone daring to stop you. If you enter a five- or six-story apartment building, office building, or hotel, you can take the elevator if you don't feel like walking, and you will also receive many conveniences when making inquiries. Otherwise, they will first size you up from head to toe because of your blue cloth long gown.</p>
<p>The elevator operator says: [Hey! Are your legs broken? Walk up, why take the tofu frame!]</p>
<p>The person answering your questions will say in a strange tone, slowly and deliberately: [Open your own eyes and look for it, I'm not hired by you.]</p>
<p>Hmph! What else is there to say about the preferential treatment of a Western suit.</p>
<p>If you occasionally carry a small grocery basket or an oil bottle on the street for your mother or wife, you will receive many criticisms if you are wearing a Western suit.</p>
<p>Heh, this person is really funny, wearing a Western suit but carrying a basket in his hand.]</p>
<p>Actually, what does it matter? But people will treat you like you're putting on a show, or even...</p>
<p>[A wrongful death!]</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have an itchy throat or are hungry and eat cold noodles at a street stall, you will receive similar criticisms and get no help.</p>
<p>If you wear a long gown, that's considered normal, and no one will say anything to you. Why? Because it's a [special permit].</p>
<p>Therefore, wearing a Western suit is like carrying a [preferential ticket], while wearing a long gown is like carrying a [special permit].</p>
<p>However, wearing a Western suit also has a [special permit] effect in one area. This unique [special permit] (which is certainly not allowed for those in the long gown class) is that you can walk a dog. Therefore, all you gentlemen who wear long gowns, if you plan to take an animal for a walk (if you don't want to at all, that's of course best), then you should drag along a [cat]!</p>
<p>Alas, people's words are frightening!</p>
<h3 id="e62">Strange Food Records <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Jingzheng</p>
<p>Different places have vastly different customs. Naturally, food is no exception. I happened to see a record about strange foods in the world. It was truly unheard of and unseen.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Japan, some people use sugar juice and wild honey to soak and cook oranges, creating a very special kind of orange candy.</p>
<p>Volcanic mud, according to experts, can be used as food. This food was found at the foot of a volcano in Japan. This soil is found five to one inch below the surface, tastes like potatoes, and contains a large amount of nutrients that can sustain our lives for a long time!</p>
<p>The Javanese take the soil under the bark of trees, boil it, and use it as food. Africans eat termites containing liquid raw, or sometimes fry or roast them with oil. People in [blank space] place make a paste out of ant eggs, then mix it with sweet almonds to create a fragrant delicacy.</p>
<p>In Guangdong, southwestern America, South America, Australia, and other places in our country, many people eat snakes, and it is said that they taste very good; perhaps everyone knows this. However, there is also a kind of smelly rat whose meat can also be eaten. [The natives of Argentina consider smelly rats as delicacies, just as we view ham and chicken]. A Kansas University professor once said this!</p>
<p>Professor A.M. Reese used gophers and muskrats to make various meats; the eaters could not tell the difference. He also tried making things like dragons and fire snakes. (Fire snakes have become common commodities in the Mexico City market.) He also cut up crocodiles into slices, which he said tasted as delicious as beef.</p>
<p>These scattered records show that in the future world, humans may not need to worry about the lack of food resources because they are inexhaustible and unlimited!</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Procession of the Wedding <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>When love matures, it must go through the stage of marriage. The character for marriage in history is written as "昏" [hūn, meaning dusk]. The *Bai Hu Tong* says: "Marriage is completed at dusk, hence the name '昏'." This custom seems to be the same in both the East and the West, because weddings are always held in the late afternoon near dusk. There has never been a wedding where the piano is played and songs are sung in a grand hall early in the morning, with the couple happily united. There is another point on which East and West are in agreement: according to our country's old custom, when a woman is about to be married off, just before she enters the bridal sedan chair, her father must hold his daughter in his arms and whisper a few words of earnest advice. In Western customs, during the wedding procession, the bride must also be supported by her father, slowly and reluctantly bringing his daughter to the chapel. The intention is nothing more than that the father has spent more than ten or twenty years of his efforts, raising and educating her, and now it has come to an end. The wedding march, in the wedding's first movement, is written by Mendelssohn, the melody is solemn, clear, and measured, like lifting up and dropping down, listening to it makes one feel transported. The second movement, after the wedding, is written by Wagner, it is also undulating, subtle, and slowly exudes purity. But at that time, the guests, one after another, threw confetti and flowers at the faces of the newlyweds, in a burst of chaos, and no longer paid attention to how the melody was. Our country's young people are enamored with Westernization, and Western wedding marches are also used in their wedding ceremonies.</p>
<p>But most orchestras deal with it casually, and the result is neither fish nor fowl. My old friend Zhao Junzhiyan, who was the director of the orchestra at Jiaotong University, has the intelligence of a teacher, the beauty of Wu Shao's music, and has specially organized the Haiguang Wind Orchestra with several comrades to serve as the noblest professional music, which is very different from ordinary orchestras. (All contact is handled by Yongxing Music Store at No. 403 Jing'an Temple Road.) The ancients said well: [When the angle is moved, the valley flowers will brighten, when Shang is struck, the spring forest will shatter]. The Haiguang Orchestra's artistic excellence is good enough to move these two sentences to them.</p>
<h3 id="e64">How to Use a Thermos <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Juchuan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Changcheng Gan's article "How to Use a Thermos" in the previous issue of this journal, I feel that there is still something more to be said about how to extend its life and maintain its effectiveness. I am adding two more points below.</p>
<p>If the cork is new, you may want to use a silver needle to pierce a small hole in the center of the cork to avoid the glass liner breaking halfway. This is because when the bottle is filled with boiling water, it gradually cools over time. When it cools, the water contracts. At this time, if the cork is plugged so tightly that water cannot leak out, it will shrink and break the glass liner.</p>
<p>When you buy a new thermos, unscrew it before using it and remove any cardboard inside to prevent water from seeping in and rotting the inside of the bottle shell. If the inside is unglazed, you can spread petroleum jelly (used for machinery) all over the inside or paint it. Use a nail to poke a few holes in the bottom so that if water seeps in, it will not easily rust and rot, and it can flow out through the holes. Also, apply anti-rust oil to the threads so that it will be easier to unscrew and inspect in the future. (With thanks)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Things to Know When Driving a Car <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Revised and Supplemented</p>
<p>Most car drivers think that when a tire blows, the safest way is to brake immediately, the faster the better. Some drivers also believe that this method can protect the hard rubber tire.</p>
<p>In fact, such an emergency method may protect the rubber tire, but it may also harm the driver's life. Because if the driver brakes immediately at that time, it will help the car body to overturn due to the action of centrifugal force. Wouldn't that be a case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish? Drivers should remember never to panic and rashly apply the brakes when a tire blows. The correct method is to increase the vehicle speed to about five miles per hour. At that time, the car needs a contracting force the most. If the driver can remember this method, they can always get the necessary contracting force. The second step is to gradually brake, so that the car body is stable and can be stopped under control without suddenly overturning.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Problem of Transportation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Shouzhuo</p>
<p>In order to maintain the generous profits of investors, public transportation such as buses and trams has already been raised in price again. The increase is more than 50%, which is an unprecedented precedent and can be described as shocking. Colleagues A, B, and C have each determined a method to deal with this problem, and they are specially recorded as follows, for the benefit of those who wish to save on consumption.</p>
<p>A's method is to [reduce the number of trips]. He originally took the bus for his daily commute, but now he has decided to take the bus as usual in the morning to avoid the fatigue of walking, which would affect his work spirit. In the afternoon, he will switch to walking. At that time, the official business is over, and it is no problem to go home a little later. Even if he feels tired, he can recover during his night's rest. As a result, he can save 25% of the fare. (Assuming a 50% increase)</p>
<p>B's method is to [shorten the route]. He lives on Jing'an Temple Road, which is on Tongli Road. He originally commuted daily from Xiejiao Station to Henan Road Station, with a fare of one dime each time for third class. Now, he walks to Mahe Road Station in the morning, and takes the bus to Mahe Road Station in the afternoon, getting on and off there. The fare is still one dime each time, absolutely no more than a penny.</p>
<p>C's method is to [reset the standard]. He will switch to walking on sunny days and still take the bus on rainy days. In the past, his bus fare was about ten yuan per month. Now, counting a quarter of rainy days, plus the price increase (also assuming a 50% increase), he can save more than six yuan.</p>
<p>[When three people walk together, there must be one who can be my teacher]. Now we can use this to metaphorize that A, B, and C [choose the good and follow it]. I wish to learn from B, or even walk regardless of wind or rain.</p>

Steam the potatoes and beets together until cooked, peel them, and cut them into dice-sized pieces as well. Cut the onions into fine pieces with salt. Then, crack two eggs into a bowl, remove the whites and keep the yolks. Beat the yolks into a paste. Then, combine the fresh meat and other ingredients. Take the egg yolk juice and the heated vegetable oil and gradually drip them in, mixing well. At the same time, add an appropriate amount of monosodium glutamate, pepper powder, salt, etc., dripping and mixing gradually until evenly mixed. It would be even better to add fresh cooked shrimp and ham.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Alfalfa, commonly known as "goutou" or "jinyang," is a beautiful thing. When the new product is on the market, it is in the limelight, occupying a special place on the banquet with new bean sprouts. These days, new goutou is active again, at ten cents per ounce. In this era of generally high prices, it doesn't feel too expensive, so my family has eaten it twice. One time it was braised goutou with meat (this character is made up by the author; pronounced "bian," the same as "bian" meaning acupuncture). The goutou was moistened with meat oil and was very fragrant and delicious. The fresh green color was also very pleasing to the eye. One time it was made vegetarian, with added dried tofu strips and braised together. The oil had to be used heavily, and a little white wine had to be added. Although it was vegetarian, it was still fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>Monday: Meatballs, goutou, sweet and sour ribbonfish, stir-fried glass noodles with vegetables, braised edamame in sauce</p>
<p>Tuesday: Leek sprouts with shredded beef, braised tofu skin with white shrimp, braised cabbage, salted vegetable and broad bean soup</p>
<p>Wednesday: Dried meat, grape soup, scallion-baked small crucian carp, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe, deep-fried dough sticks with bok choy</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato beef slices, mixed tofu, shredded tofu skin and water chestnut, salted vegetable and soybean sprouts</p>
<p>Friday: Broad beans stir-fried with shredded pork, steamed eggs with dried shrimp, braised vegetarian winter melon, stir-fried flat beans in sweet sauce</p>
<p>Saturday: Stir-fried silver sprouts with shredded chicken, braised flower carp with glass noodles, braised vegetarian ten-scene dish, scallion oil noodles</p>
<p>Sunday: Duck and chicken soup, stir-fried eel back, goutou, mixed jellyfish</p>
<p>Meat prices are soaring, so we can eat tofu; if tofu prices soar, what can we do! (Written by Fanxing)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Journalist's Day <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Weisan</p>
<p>Today is Journalist's Day, just like Children's Day and Teacher's Day, we also have such a festive day. How should we commemorate it? I think we don't need to fantasize about the future, but should review the past, and more importantly, strive to uphold our current positions. Let everyone be silent for a moment and make a self-accounting—this "we" refers to all journalists. It is necessary today, not meaningless.</p>
<p>Reviewing the past does not require tracing back too far. Taking the most recent four years or so, the entire nation has gone through such a major ordeal. Many journalists have fulfilled their due responsibilities. This is something to be proud of. If writing the history of this era, the struggle of journalists cannot be erased. We don't need to doubt the old saying "Power cannot corrupt, wealth cannot seduce." There are plenty of facts to answer, and we can cite a certain person or a certain event to explain the essence of it. It is autumn now. If you go to the park, you can see pine and cypress trees standing tall one by one. Under the trees are many fallen leaves. "When the autumn wind rises, the yellow leaves fly." The autumn wind is sweeping away the fallen leaves. We don't want to be fallen leaves, and we hope that everyone is a strong and proud pine and cypress tree, standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p>The times give us the opportunity to be tempered. We should seize the times. If we say that we have suffered, everyone has a share, not just journalists. However, we stand at the forefront of society, so we must fulfill the responsibility of "standing at the forefront." Everyone should embrace the view that "there is no high position that is not built on a low foundation," and do a little bit to accumulate a little bit, like ants carrying a grain of rice and horses bearing a thousand pounds. We only seek our own peace, only do our own best, and everyone should work hard in their respective positions.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Wang Yunwu's Account of Lufei Bohong's Success Story <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The memorial service for Mr. Lufei Bohong was held at 3:00 p.m. on August 10th at the Confucius Hall here. All colleagues of the Zhonghua Book Company, members of parliament staying in Hong Kong, and friends and relatives of Mr. Lufei Bohong attended in person. Representatives from various cultural groups numbered in the thousands. The memorial service was conducted as scheduled, and the meeting adjourned in a mournful and solemn atmosphere at 4:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Chaojun delivered the opening remarks. After the oblation, Mr. Wang Yunwu reported on Mr. Bohong's life, saying:</p>
<p>"Mr. Bohong only received five years of education from his mother, one year from his father, and one year from a teacher. At the age of seventeen, he independently studied. At the age of seventeen, he founded a family school in Nanchang. At the age of nineteen, he founded the New Academic World Bookstore in Wuchang. At the age of twenty, he served as the chief writer for the Hankou Chu Bao. Because his remarks offended the authorities, the newspaper was forced to cease publication. He transferred to Shanghai to manage the Qianchangming Bookstore. At the age of twenty-one, he joined the Civilization Book Company as an editor. Two years later, he became the publishing director of the Commercial Press and the editor of the Education Magazine..."</p>
<p>"In addition to the struggle of his youth, Mr. Bohong's success was also due to his profound vision. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he predicted that the Qing Dynasty would be overthrown and the Republic of China would be established. He gathered comrades to prepare new textbooks to meet the new needs. On New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China, he founded the Zhonghua Book Company and published the Zhonghua textbooks, which were popular for a time... In the past five or six years, he predicted that our country's legal tender policy would inevitably be implemented, so he focused on the printing of banknotes, and the book company's business became even more prosperous. Mr. Bohong also wrote an article on war preparedness in the inaugural issue of the "New China," believing that if China were to engage in external wars, it would have to fight a long-term war. Therefore, he advocated active preparation in the three areas of military affairs, people's food, and transportation. His opinions are quite in line with the government's current facilities."</p>
<p>"Mr. Bohong's excellent character must also be mentioned here: (1) Strong will—he encountered many difficulties in the early stages of the Zhonghua Book Company, but he was able to persevere. (2) Progressiveness—he was unwilling to be behind others in everything he did. After he established his own brand, he competed fiercely with the Commercial Press in business. The Commercial Press originally started with textbooks, and later expanded its scope of publication. Mr. Bohong was unwilling to let anything go: The Commercial Press published the Sibu Congkan, and Zhonghua immediately edited and printed the Sibu Beiyao; the Commercial Press compiled and printed the Ciyuan, and Zhonghua published Ci... (3) Focus—Mr. Bohong has been in charge of the Zhonghua Book Company for thirty years, with one heart and one mind, and no other pursuits. He rarely engaged in outside socializing. He even politely declined when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited him to become an official. The business world in our country often says: "People in the same trade are like enemies." The Commercial Press and Zhonghua inevitably experienced this phenomenon at a certain period. However, after intense and fair competition, they gradually gained a deeper understanding of each other and gradually turned into sincere cooperation. In the past few years, my understanding of Mr. Bohong's sincere attitude is exactly the same as the degree of suspicion I had of him before."</p>
<h3 id="e72">I Am an Apprentice, I Want to Take Supplementary Lessons <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ren</p>
<p>I was quite moved after reading the article "How Shop Assistants and Apprentices Can Study" in the Spring and Autumn column. I am also an apprentice in a cloth shop, and how eager I am for further education!</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was still living a school life, but now I live an apprentice life and serve in society. I feel that my knowledge is shallow and insufficient, which makes me feel extremely painful. Finally, I found a way out in the pain and entered a supplementary school. However, the expenses must be borne by my family. But the home of an apprentice can probably be imagined.</p>
<p>Since entering the supplementary school, I have gained a lot of knowledge that is helpful for my job, and I can also get to know many unfamiliar classmates. However, I also feel a shortcoming. The biggest problem in the supplementary school is that it starts well but ends poorly. In the first month of school, the classroom is packed and there is not a single empty seat. Some seats even need to be added. This phenomenon shows that there is no shortage of ambitious young people. However, when the semester ends, anyone who has been attending the supplementary school can probably see that the number of students has dwindled to just a few. Although there are vocational workers who have various reasons for it in their jobs, it should not be so desolate. After my various investigations, I got the following two answers:</p>
<p>First, when entering a supplementary school, there is no need for a level placement exam, and students can insert themselves at will. Therefore, general young people with high ambitions insert themselves into a level that is higher than their own without knowing their own abilities. Just imagine how they can keep up later, so they lose interest and drop out halfway.</p>
<p>Second, they don't have the determination to go to school and are absent from class at will. They even borrow the name of supplementary lessons to go to other improper places without being bound by them.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not a generalization. Perhaps some people drop out halfway due to the influence of their jobs, and we sympathize and forgive them. But it is a great pity that people generally drop out and are absent at will. We are fortunate to have the opportunity to enter a supplementary school to study. In this society, there are still thousands and thousands of young apprentices and shop assistants who do not have time to study but want to pursue advanced studies. Now that the Shenbao is promoting the reading movement for shop assistants and apprentices, since we have the opportunity to read, we should work harder for ourselves, and then push ourselves to serve the society and the country. (With thanks)</p>

<p>Twelve Unexpected Storms</p>
<p>"Don't be so suspicious!... Go back quickly, come out quickly!... "It wasn't until Mei Bao repeatedly urged her that she squinted her old eyes and said vaguely.</p>
<p>Although Mei Bao knew that she was drunk, this fifty-year-old Wang, the warden of the dormitory, was indeed too capable and too shrewd, so Mei Bao couldn't help but reluctantly put down the doubts in her heart.</p>
<p>"Who doesn't like gambling! He usually doesn't gamble. But when someone pulls him to go, he can't control himself... "Mei Bao had already stepped out of the warden's office, and Warden Zhang was still talking to herself inside. This made Mei Bao feel much more at ease. And what the person who came said was also very reasonable.</p>
<p>"Originally, they wanted to send Sixth Elder to come, but unfortunately he is getting engaged these days, and he really can't spare the time, so they asked me, the old man, to run here for you."</p>
<p>When he said this, Mei Bao's suspicion caused by the fact that Little Dog's brother didn't come was mostly dispelled.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, another half month slipped by unnoticed. One afternoon, Warden Wang, as usual, gathered a large bundle of mail that had just been sent in through the gatehouse and scrutinized it one by one in the sunlight, showing an attitude as solemn as checking military intelligence.

<p>— Liutang</p>
<p>The Ullambana Festival (1)</p>
<p>As the early autumn arrives, in every neighborhood, one often sees paper clothes fluttering, strings of ghost money, and at night, the noisy sounds of drums and cymbals, and the mournful sounds of conch shells. Monks chant scriptures, which lasts for hours, and it is called the Ullambana Festival. According to research, Ullambana is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word "Ullambana," also written as "Ullambaka," not that the meanings are different, but the transliterations are slightly different. "Ullamba" or "Ulamba" means "upside down." "Pana" refers to utensils, translated into Chinese as "pen" (basin), and the sounds of "pen" and "pana" can be combined to form the same word, so "pen" can be said to be both a phonetic and semantic translation.</p>
<p>The origin of the Ullambana Festival is the folk tale of Maudgalyayana saving his mother. The Venerable Maudgalyayana was a disciple of the Buddha. He saw his mother fall into the realm of hungry ghosts. Maudgalyayana wanted to feed her, but his mother was consumed by flames of hunger, fire coming out of her mouth and turning everything into charcoal. Maudgalyayana was overcome with grief and sought guidance from the Buddha. The Buddha spoke to him about the Ullambana Sutra. "Ullambana" means a vessel for rescuing those hung upside down. Therefore, he was instructed to prepare abundant offerings on the fifteenth day of the seventh month every year, offering hundreds of items to the Three Jewels and offering them to the passing Buddhas, thus saving seven generations of ancestors. Therefore, in Buddhism, there is the Ullambana Dharma Assembly to save the ancestors from the suffering of being hung upside down. I once saw Li Yunfu perform "Maudgalyayana Saving His Mother," holding a bamboo stick in his mouth with two lit candles on it, symbolizing fire spitting from the mouth. Maudgalyayana's mother eventually relied on the power of the Ullambana Festival to be liberated from the realm of hungry ghosts.</p>
<p>The Ullambana Sutra was introduced to China and translated by Zhu Fahu during the Western Jin Dynasty, and the Ullambana Festival appeared in China during the Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang. Buddhism flourished in China during the Six Dynasties, and the teachers and translators who came to preach were all Western monks, called "Dao Ren" (Taoists), just as Guanshiyin Bodhisattva was called Cihang Dao Ren, which is the same idea. Only after Fu Qin did Chinese people begin to be tonsured as monks. "Seng" (monk) is a transliteration of "Sangha." However, the rituals performed in today's Ullambana Festival are actually Yoga Flaming Mouth rituals. "Yoga" is the general name for Esoteric Buddhism. Within Buddhism, there is a distinction between Exoteric and Esoteric. The Exoteric can be found in scriptures and texts, which is the Buddhism popular in China. The Esoteric relies on the transmission from a master, reciting mantras and practicing dharma, which is the Yellow Sect and Red Sect revered in Sichuan and Tibet.</p>
