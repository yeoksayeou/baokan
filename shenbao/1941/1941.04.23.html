<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹會戰將告段落</h3>
<p>德義兩國賭博性的冒險侵吞，在當前的巴爾幹戰爭裹，又到了將近成功階段。日來英倫電訊所　傳的各報論調，大半認定英國遠征軍難免將從巴爾幹撤退。即如泰晤士報社論裹說：「務須不要忘記，當英國軍隊最初在希臘登陸時，就沒有形成足以對抗德國衡進的一種同盟的可能。」此其含義，願然把這次巴爾幹戰爭失敗的原因，主要歸之於土耳其的不肯合作。又如每日郵報，却更明白的指出來：「當南希士三國同盟陷於絕望時，很願然的，我們祗有註定了失敗。」當然，蘇土的沒有出而積極干涉，是英希南這次巴爾幹戰爭失敗的最大原因；但從另一方面說，蘇土所以至今沒有採取積極步驟，却又不得推原於德義軍事成就的迅速，亦即是「閃電戰」的宏效。</p>
<p>檢視二週有餘的戰況，在英希南三國方面，幾乎是一貫的先事堵截，終於後撤，絲毫沒有主動的運用；致使德義侵略軍事始終保持着攻勢，實現了他們的企圖。這是英希南聯軍在軍事上失敗的最大原因。英國首相邱吉爾上星期演說時，會經明白承認過，在當前的階段中，英國對於南希兩國的援助，不能不受着許多其他方面戰略的考慮，而有所限制；英國當前所敢說的，祗有重申與他同盟國奮鬥到底的決心而已。尋繹言外之意，英國在巴爾幹陸地上，並沒有集中所有力量，準備與德義決戰；因此之故，聯軍英勇抵抗戰得前途，當然其為暗澹。何況南希兩國內部不安，又加速了戰敗的過程。且當德義大軍一舉而切斷希士間聯繫，南希間聯繫，同時又把南希兩國各切成段時，南斯拉夫抵抗力量當然因此驟減，加以內部動搖，逐首先宣告崩潰。至於希臘所以還能力支殘局，願然得力於英國協助；假定英國軍事對實行撤退，則希臘這一次光榮的戰績，也就不得不即此收場：此後籠罩了整個巴爾幹的，便是黑暗，便是暴力。</p>
<p>迨巴爾幹半島被愁雲慘霧，驚濤駭浪所淹沒，則爾後一英國為中心的反侵略戰爭，就要移到地中海，紅海，近東，非洲，英倫三島，以及大西洋等幾個可能舞台之上。推想時機，揆之先例，則德義向外擴張，早空間每一片段的成功，則時間即有每一片段的停滯。而這一次巴爾幹會戰之後，下一幕聚門將在何時何地揭開，目前當難論斷。但德義所選下一幕施用壓力的主要對象，這些天來，似已有相當端倪可資探索。假定探索不　，則土耳其與西班牙，以及法國的維希政府，殆將不幸而次第入選了。誠以這一切的向背剛柔，對於德義今後的戰略，實有非常重大的關係。</p>
<p>先以土耳其來說。德義現在除了蘇聯而外，機會已控制了整個歐洲大陸，所剩一片乾淨土，惟有土耳其的歐洲部份。其問有關緊要的，土耳其的地理位置，在今後的一切演變裹，關係極鉅，蓋德義東下打擊英帝國的最好捷徑，即是通過土耳其；縱使不然，他們由非洲方面繞過土耳其，以圖達到近東，或印度，也不得不先把對土關係佈置妥當。同時，近東各國的態度，亦不受土耳其立場的重大影響：而法屬敘利亞的未來命運，恐怕也要看土耳其的舉措轉移。</p>
<p>除了土耳其，地義侵入非洲的另一大道，便是通過西班牙，奪取直布羅陀。這裹，德義可以獲得地中海上最狹的水面，跨到非洲；且對於英帝國生命綫的地中海，又可給予一個致命的威脅。一年多以來的歐戰裹，德義始終沒有停止過對西班牙的脅誘；而今後無論他們對土耳其的交涉能否成功，然對於西班牙的活動，一定會無數倍的緊張起來。</p>
<p>除了土西兩國而外，德義對於法國維希政府的壓力，勢必跟著加緊。這什麼藉口而眞止所垂涎的，當然是法國海軍艦隊。</p>
<p>綜合言之，德義的陸空軍雖戰績卓牽，然其海軍則對軍則對英非常願明的處於劣勢；所以，他，他們要想進一步打擊英帝國，勢必不得由陸上尋找通路，或者用盡一切方法，增加自身的海上實力。遠東的日本所以得在德義之前弄者，亦在於此。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（四）（六）</p>
<h3>美國海軍大觀</h3>
<p>水兵分兩種，一種專在甲板上仟事，一種則在機房之中度日，無論二等水手或三等火夫，經十二個星期的訓練，餉銀爲美金三十六元。所担任的事務，像管理船上雜務，充水雷兵，無綫電員，機匠，　機匠或砲手等，都是最起碼的下士。及至二十五歲再行入伍，以二等兵資格起用，逐漸上升，每月可得美金一百元，這時他便可成婚，安居樂業。水手們最高可升至下級軍曹，至四十五歲即可退伍，所領的恩俸爲美金一千四百元。這一行水手業，看起來似乎沒有十分出息，航海之時還要遠離家鄉，共實每月的給養和退伍金算起來，爲數亦尚可觀，何况還能最高度充任一個上級軍曹，雖不能榮宗耀祖，但也足以衣食無虞，溫飽牛世呢。</p>
<p>世界各國海軍，其軍官的升遷最重資望與服務年代，美國海軍亦復如此。官佐們須以長時問的磨練，去獲得他們的前程。祇有一個例外，就是在作戰期中，如果立有功勳殊續，那末升遷之快，即可出人意外了。「亞那波里」海軍學校便是美國各級軍官的產生地。舉凡設計造艦者，組織軍艦而使之作戰者，一切人員都來自此校。</p>
<p>「亞那波里」的畢業生，在海軍中的職位，一開手便是掛金綫的校尉。上述水手們的最後階段，即爲這班畢業生的開蒙之處。一述七年要過着海上航海生活。首在主力艦上學習三四年，研究各種　要組織，其後三年則在驅逐艦或潛艇之中練習。這樣的過了七個年頭，他便獲得下尉的頭銜，改派至岸上，入海軍軍官學校，從事專科研究。至三十歲時再行編入艦上服務，任海軍上尉之職。</p>
<p>此後他便要受到嚴格的甄別，因爲海軍少將的位置非常稀少珍貴，這個甄別試騐倒是很難應付的。一級中四百個學生至此至少巳淘汰去了百分之二十五。及至他三十七歲時，所剩者祇有一百五十人合格於海軍少校之職；四十三歲時人數又少，只有八十人任海軍中校。其中四十人派在各艦充任艦長，能獲得最後目標海軍少將之職者，其數將不及十人。他所選學的專科，對於職位亦有上下的關係。從傳統上講起來，砲術科居於首位。如果往彭薩利村去專攻航空術，在目下也是一條終南捷徑。其他各鬥，像外交，建築，工程，戰略，及律師等，海軍中亦包羅甚廣。</p>
<p>海軍官員的前途，一方面固須靠他的天才，一方面操守品格亦關係綦重。國會法令承認他是一個堂堂的紳士，姓名之前可以冠上頭銜，在船上時得以自居　空，並有一僕供呼喚差遺。艦上士官室中並有「私人俱樂部」以資消遣。俸給與各種津貼可獲美金四千元儘可以　妻成家。</p>
<p>在目下的緊急時期中，這班校尉官級者，如有功續，其升遷之速，往往出人意外。也許在幾個　之間，他就一躍而爲少校，要是在承平之時，總要七年工夫纔能調升此級呢。如果在作戰之頃，再立有殊功，則中校的職位，也可不必等待六年之久，便垂手可得。最後則可遷升至將校級，船上掛有將旗，管理一組艦隊，而於六十四歲時，以少將銜退休。依照海軍中的慣例，少將的兒子往往也多「克紹箕裘」承繼他老子的行業，而投身於海軍界中。</p>
<p>美國因爲擴軍關係，在兩洋海軍之中亟須多數仕官，當局雖召集了退伍取人，縮短了「亞那波里」的習學期爲三年，然而目下需要的二萬五千人還無着落。美國海部對於訓練人才方面，除了軍校以外，各地尚設有預備隊訓練所，以補充軍校人材之不足。</p>
<p>海軍預備隊操練一斑睡於吊狀中之水手</p>
<p>（六）海軍根據地</p>
<p>美國海軍前輩故馬罕少將曾說：「海軍係由人，船，和根據地組織而成，其最重要者即爲人，船，與根據地」。海軍根據地爲各種大小軍艦的生命給養地，其意義甚爲重大。近世海軍艦隊決不能在離開他們海軍根據地二千五百英里之外而活動。（未完）</p>

<h3>一餐</h3>
<p>— 左蕙</p>
<p>鄉　有信來，報告了一大篇饑饉的災况，末了是請上海的同鄉　戚想想辦法。說起親戚，我的姨父現在是最得法的一個，信中當然也提到，於是冒著濛濛的細雨我向姨父家出發了。</p>
<p>姨父公事忙，不在家，我就和姨母談了一大堆吃糠，餓死，請求賑　的　。姨母不識字，給她有　常然不會懂，所以我不得不盡量的把災情仔細地用一　嘴巴描摹出來；可是姨母的一家得了法啦，聽見我說來說去總是餓死，</p>
<p>吃糠，就有些不趁心，倒是那個紹興大姐聽得來痴張着嘴，好不難過的樣子。和鄕間的來信的步驟一樣，先說了一大堆苦情慘劇，末了我叫姨母想想辦法　所謂想辦日當然要姨母動動發財手了，可是姨母皺一皺眉，她厭惡着我竟這樣會嘮叨罷，反問我說：「你們一家不是都在上海嗎？別的人家，我想　你對你的姨父說說看。」</p>
<p>其實，我們一家設若也在鄉問的話，姨母也不見得會慷慨。</p>
<p>女傭來通知吃飯了。也好，米貴，我外甥皇帝今天要揩揩姨母的油了。</p>
<p>走進飯廳，沿飯桌坐下。只有三個人坐一桌，假使把我除外，那就只有姨母和表妹二個人吃飯呢。天公眞會戲弄人，像姨母那樣的人家偏偏只有二個人吃飯。</p>
<p>不知姨母是客套還是眞情，她說：一蕙，你吃，姨母家裹別客氣。</p>
<p>於是我不客氣，習慣地拿起了飯碗，沒有吃了幾口，霍地「嘰的一聲，撕破了飯桌四周的沈靜的氣氛。聲昔是這樣的鄉亮，尖銳，我一驚，二隻眼睛不其然而然的射向了坐在我對面的西施型的表妹身上。這眞是難以相信的事，我的多病的表妹竟能發出這種健旺的聲音。探其臉色，原來正倒豎著蛾　，二條視綫狠狠地斜射着那個大姐，那個大姐眼睛　瞪著，和我同樣的不知一個所以。好久，才低聲的問：「小姐，什麽？」</p>
<p>「什麽？」表妹很迅速的把那碗水曾吃過的白飯向桌子那邊推了過米。</p>
<p>姨母和大姐的眼光同時被那碗飯吸了過去，一會，姨母說：「翠英，你把那碗飯去倒了罷：」</p>
<p>於是那個翠英大姐灰氣色地把眼皮緩緩地一合，拿着那碗飯出飯廳去了，而我可始終被蒙在鼓裹。</p>
<p>一瞬眼，翠英拿着空碗回來了。飯鍋子在旁邊的小桌子上，我看翠英重興替小姐盛飯</p>
<p>表妹的怒氣尚米消，當翠英把一碗飯傳給她時，她說：「替我另外去拿隻空碗來！」</p>
<p>翠英向廚房跑了一趟，空碗拿來了。表妹是個奇貨，她不知要空碗作甚？我一邊把第二碗飯塞進口去，一邊偷看我的表妹將要在那隻空碗裏變出一些什麼把戲來。</p>
<p>表妹　　象牙筷子，翹著蘭花手指，她在數著飯粒，把滿碗的飯一粒一粒地撥到空碗裏區，數　數的，　地又對翠英發脾氣：「你眞不知」天到晚幹些什麽？</p>
<p>話沒說完，我的第二碗飯光了。我一立起來，姨母連忙叫：「翠英，盛飯盛飯。於是我算解了翠英一時的窘。</p>
<p>但盛好了飯，結果翠英仍被表妹叫了過去：「你看呀！剛剛一碗滿是老鼠屙，這决又滿是小石子，不知你把米淘了沒有？小石子吃　去了，生盲腸炎，算誰的　？老鼠屙就是最不衛生的，眞是　這碗飯給你吃去　一</p>
<p>那時姨母把椅子一推。</p>
<p>我問：「姨母，你吃好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「唔，我的胃口就是不很好的，這决吃一碗半己是比往日多一些了。」</p>
<p>姨母吃完了飯，表妹也立起來了說：「我也吃不下了，想起老鼠屙把昨日的飯嘔出來也來不及呢！」</p>
<p>可是我是兩樣的：一則我是客人，假使我不多吃幾碗飯，姨母也許會怪我嫌他們的小菜不好呢：再則我的肚皮比她們的大一些，並且剛剛說了計多話，肚皮就說空了，而表妹不但不說話，更坐在沙發上嚼蛋糕，餅乾……所以我本想吃他四碗，但姨母表妹都吃好了，我一個人死背飯桌總不是事，於是加緊　度，吃了碗也就算了。</p>
<p>飯後，我很有韌性的仍舊和姨母談吃糠，餓死，想叫姨母動動發財手，可是姨母的發財手把錢袋愈按愈緊，結果我斷定我是無能爲力的了。於是走了，預備遇到姨父想想辦法看。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>他的突然反抗，固然使季兆雄覺得很詫異，可是他自己却也不能就此軟化下去。</p>
<p>「好，吳老板，你的事都在我手裹，回頭你不要後悔！」設着，他便旋過身去，裝着立刻要走的架子，心裏却還想秋海棠或許會自己　圖，馬上伸出手來拉住他。</p>
<p>我沒有什麼事要後悔！」不料秋海棠竟存心不賣他的賬，話風也是一直硬到底，於是季兆雄就不能收蓬了，祇好橫一橫心頭也不回的走出區了。</p>
<p>他這麽一走，秋海棠自然也就沒有心思再看報了，他眞恨不能馬上走進去和湘綺商量；然而袁寶藩在這裹，他有什麼機曾能够跟湘綺說話呢？但　情顯然鬧得很　了，如果不先防備，萬一季兆雄眞下什麽毒手，吃了他的虧便來不及了。</p>
<p>「先找玉崑去商量一下吧！」他忽忽披上了一件白印度綢的袍子，連草帽也不帶，便很快的溜出了袁家。</p>
<p>自從湘綺生的那個女孩子出世以後，玉崑便仗着自己的機智，和秋海棠所有的金錢的力量，另外收買了一個才出生的男孩子，把她掉了出來；一切找屋子，雇奶媽的事，也統由他替他們辦好。從此，他自已便依舊用着草上飛的藝名，一直在天津搭長班；這兩三年來不知道在暗中幫了秋海棠和羅湘綺多少决的忙，季兆雄的無法找到他們的香巢，一大半也就爲有趙玉崑夾在裹面變化騰挪的緣故。</p>
<p>直到現在，他自己却還是個光棍，終年住在法租界的一家小公腐裏，過着極怪僻的生活：房裏除了一張狹得不到三尺闊的木榻和一口已經破了四個角的衣箱之外，便空洞洞的再也找不到別的東西了。　（八八）</p>

<h3>我的妻子是「新女性」</h3>
<p>— 鞠</p>
<p>結婚己有二月，該寫下些「她」的印象吧</p>
<p>當然，她是一個摩登女性。不，她說「摩登」兩字含有蔑視意味，該稱她是新時代女子。「新時代」多麽漂亮的名訶！乳油電盪過的鬢髮，臉上是三花香粉，指甲上腥紅的蔻丹，「托托」有聲的革履，還有，還有，找名稱時倒着實　費些光陰來的呢！</p>
<p>婚後第一天，她問我所服務的公司有多少進益。我依實告訴她。「呵！這樣低微嗎？她吃驚似地凝視我，「那來，我們的生活怎維持呢？」這問得靜　的我　趨於靜默了。她祗得怏快地照着鏡框，把胭脂和勻地敷着。</p>
<p>假使有人以爲我們相互間仍保持着靜默，是由於陌生的緣故，那是誤會了。有一决，我請求她代我洗我的手絹時，她直爽地說：「你常我是奴隸嗎？你還以爲是在封建時代嗎？女人不是男子的私產了。現在是文明時代，男女一律自由平等，知道嗎？」</p>
<p>她的一篇「理直氣壯」的回答，使我目瞪口呆；我錯了，我不該使用「丈夫」的權利，來壓迫「新女性」；我柬縛了她的自由，我推翻了相互的平等。「現在是文明時代了，　禮敎早落伍了。女的不該服侍男的，正像男的不服侍女的一般。」</p>
<p>我錯了，我也　負荊請罪般底求她諒解，然而一切在」新」的籠　下，我简直値得點什麽呢？我祇有「不屑講話」的資格，我祗有沈於舌悶中的自作孽。她冷笑着：「你不愛觀電影，不會玩牌，跳舞，吸烟，請客，件件不來，你不配在這時代中生活，不上大塲面的人！」</p>
<p>「我難道不是生活在廿世紀嗎？」我把視綫移轉書本，閉目沉思。「我決不是落伍者，我也不是冬烘頭腦的楂滓，正因爲我已受過十七年的時代敎育。」</p>
<p>我也氣壯了。因爲我受新時代的影響，和文明的薰陶，多少　她濃厚些。我不苦悶了，因爲我對於她的「新女性」認識的皮毛，也投下了輕蔑的態度。</p>
<p>一我得奮鬥，我得糾正她的認識。」</p>
<p>我將用我全力，給予妻子另一個「新女性」的懿範。</p>

<h3>談「十字街頭」改編</h3>
<p>— 莎微</p>
<p>「第二怪物」魯思訪問記</p>
<p>電影「十字街頭」改編為舞臺劇，將由天風劇　演出，這是眾所周知的事了。筆者為想獲得改編的詳情，特於翌日走訪這劇的改編者魯思特先生。相見之下，我即不由得失笑起來。你道爲什麽？嘿，他的頭髮簡直長得像有一四個月沒有剪的了。要不是在白天，也許不相識的人見了他，以為「夜半歌聲」里的宋丹萍復活了呢！怪物！怪物！沈四苓後的「第一怪物」，真是名不虛傳。寒暄之後，我便正式提起問題來了。</p>
<p>筆者：「十字街頭」聞已全部脫稿，關於改編詳情，可否告知一二？</p>
<p>魯氏：沒有動手改編以前，我腦海中的舞臺上進行着的全劇，原分三幕；可是，正式編寫時，卻感到了困難，因為電影「十字街頭」留給我的素材太多了，三幕簡直是無法容納的，所以現在變了四幕。第一幕介紹全劇的人物，寫青年失業的苦悶；第二幕敘老趙獲得職業後的苦幹，與岸報復房東太太而引起的前後樓的大吵架，及其在一碰到的豔遇；第三幕述老趙與楊芝瑛在公園中的巧遇，兼敘劉大哥的離滬與工廠倒閉等原因；第四幕寫老趙的「得愛」而「失業」，終於從現實裏獲得教訓，由行徑而得到了認識。</p>
<p>筆者：改編的舞臺腳本是否完全忠實西苓的電影遺作？</p>
<p>魯氏：忠實原作為主。不過，這是常識：電影，在導演的意志的支配之下，攝取了的個別的斷片，經過了剪接與編輯，而成立了一種電影的時間與空間，但這與現實的時間與空間是有極大的區分的。而時間與空間的集中這種電影手法的使用，在舞臺上是不可能的事，所以，改編的舞臺劇本，在這些地方（時與地）是與原作稍少差異着的。此外，我想使得「十字街頭」在此時此地更有效果起見，也就吧這劇發生的年代，變動一下，移到戰後的今日。這樣，工廠倒閉與老趙的失業等等原因，當然勢非給予和原作不同的解釋的了。</p>
<p>筆者：可以知道先生對於改編本劇的自我批評嗎？</p>
<p>魯氏：一句話：「很糟」！——公演的時候，請諸位多多給予指教！</p>
<p>筆者：太客氣了。那末排演時先生預備參與共間嗎？</p>
<p>魯氏：不。我對於本劇的導演吳琛先生，可說是絕對信任的，他在劇藝是有着甚深的研究與理解。</p>
<p>談到這裏，我便告辭了出來。</p>
<h3>劇藝新聞</h3>
<p>— 覺新</p>
<p>茍慧生在更新舞臺演出以後，張翼鵬是暫時的休息了。昨天，記者曾去訪問過他，近來他因為父親張英傑（即蓋叫天）的病是相當嚴重，愛妻韓素秋也嬌軀失和沒有全癒，所以心緒是不怎麼好，不過日常練功，吊嗓和編劇的功課，是仍不稍綴的。</p>
<p>據他告訴我，預備將「鐵公雞」這部戲改編一下，取名「太平天国」，他想将張嘉祥冩成一個和目前所演戲異相反的人物，他投降向帥，完全是假的，幾次三番要行刺，都以不得近身而罷，後來被陳祥瑞窺破行徑，縱容就義，這就是全劇的一個大概，這餉戲經他改編以後，就覺得比較有意義了。</p>

<h3>詹姆斯羅斯福從影經過</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>美國白宮主人羅斯福的大公子詹姆斯羅斯福James　Roosevelt，現在常住在好萊塢，也是電影從業員之一。但最近又秉承父思，來華一行的消息。因將詹姆斯羅斯福從影的經過，寫在。</p>
<p>幼年時代</p>
<p>詹姆斯是羅斯福的最大的兒子，除了休息之外，為人嚴肅而作事努力。他從小就承繼他父親的教養。如果他喜歡政治生活的話，日後也必有相當的成就。他二十歲時，看去就像很老練，有人以為他不止這些年紀了。他的思想很豐富，而且正確。他很有演說天才，在無線電收音機中，時常會錯認到是他父親說的</p>
<p>棄政從影</p>
<p>詹姆斯羅斯福對於電影事業，一向有好感的。自大前年起，放棄政治生活而專心於好萊塢的電影事業。真奇怪，他不願再政府中任軍機職務，而喜歡做影片公司的執行人。他自加入聯美影片公司之後，就把畢生的精力，集中在電影事業上面。所以三年來對於好萊塢的影業，已不無相當的貢獻了。</p>
<p>宣告訂婚</p>
<p>羅最近傳出的消息，詹姆斯羅斯福與羅曼斯卻特女士於四月十五日宣告訂婚。斯卻特女士為女看護，他們經過相當的交友時期後，才正式訂婚，并於事前向當局請到結婚準可證。按詹姆斯方於一九四〇年三月七日和前妻貝斯蒂克許小姐佌離，鳏居了一年，才覓得現在的愛侶。</p>
<p>起程來華</p>
<p>詹姆斯羅斯福訂婚之後，於四月十九日離開舊金山，搭飛剪號東來，往陪都重慶，中途在開羅略事耽擱。羅公子此次來華，唯一目的，在秉承父志，促進中美邦交。到了重慶之後，除了有若干要務，和中國當局酌外，并將往內地各處，參觀戰跡并中國戰時建設工作進行實況。另一消息，謂繼羅公子後，尚有若干人士，將由美來華，從事考察云。</p>

<p>米蘭羅納近來同林黛妮兒打得火熱，也許今年夏季前要訂婚了。</p>

<h3>Coastal Areas of Zhejiang and Fujian Fall; Fierce Battles in Suburban Areas; Chinese Forces in Eastern Zhejiang Counterattack and Briefly Recapture Zhenhai; Japanese Forces Northwest of Zhuji Encircled and Severely Attacked by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese troops landing in the bays of Fujian and Zhejiang are currently advancing inland. Informed sources in all circles here are not alarmed by this development, having anticipated this action by the Japanese army. It is generally believed that the wider the Japanese army spreads, the more beneficial it will be to the defending Chinese forces. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) Japanese troops advancing towards Zhuji from Shaoxing Fushan were ambushed by Chinese forces in the Xindianwan area, resulting in fierce fighting and heavy casualties for the Japanese. On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese reinforced with a large number of troops and dozens of aircraft, launching a fierce attack on Zhuji. By noon, the city of Zhuji was invaded by the Japanese. Fierce battles are still ongoing in the suburbs. (2) Japanese troops advancing to Sandu (south of Yingdianjie, northwest of Zhuji) from Dayuanzhen on the morning of the 20th continued their advance. The Chinese forces took advantage of the terrain to encircle the Japanese, and are currently tightening the encirclement, launching a fierce attack. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) Japanese troops advancing west along the Yong River have increased to over four thousand and are continuing their fierce westward assault. They broke into Ningbo city at noon on the 20th. Chinese forces engaged the Japanese in a bloody battle within the city, resulting in heavy casualties for the Japanese and considerable losses for the Chinese. Fierce battles are still ongoing in the suburbs. (2) After most of the Japanese forces in Zhenhai moved west, the Chinese forces immediately turned back towards Zhenhai and launched a fierce attack. At 2:00 PM on the 20th, they briefly recaptured Zhenhai, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese.

Chinese and Japanese forces are currently engaged in bloody battles near Lianjiang and Changle. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Fierce Battles on Both Banks of the Min River; Rumors of Japanese Occupation of Fuzhou</p>
<p>Fuzhou: Japanese troops have occupied Fuzhou. Yesterday morning, a vanguard of Japanese troops passed through the foreign settlement (an undefined area) and reached the city, occupying the entire city at noon without encountering resistance. Japanese naval and military authorities issued a communiqué announcing that Japanese forces had entered Fuzhou city yesterday, stating that the army and navy closely cooperated, commencing operations at dawn on April 19th, and after a surprise landing on both the north and south banks of the Min River, the army and navy destroyed four Chinese gun emplacements and the Mawei naval base, and then entered Fuzhou city on the 21st. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Chinese Troops Gather in Eastern Zhejiang to Counterattack Ningbo and Zhenhai</p>
<p>Chongqing: Official communiqués recently stated that the Sino-Japanese war along the eastern coast of China, from northeastern Zhejiang Province to parts of eastern Fujian Province, was in a state of high tension yesterday. Official communiqués have now for the first time admitted that the Japanese forces, after occupying Shaoxing, have also occupied Ningbo and Zhenhai. (Japanese forces in Shanghai have already declared that Fuzhou was occupied yesterday afternoon.) The communiqué continued that Zhuji, southwest of Shaoxing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, has also been captured by Japanese troops advancing from Shaoxing and Xiaoshan. The battles for Wenzhou and Fuzhou are still ongoing. The communiqué also stated that fierce street fighting occurred at noon on Sunday when Japanese forces occupied Ningbo. Japanese troops departing from Zhenhai, along with over four thousand Japanese reinforcements landing midway in Ningbo, launched a fierce attack on Ningbo, but Chinese forces continued to resist strongly. It also stated that Chinese forces recaptured Zhenhai again at 2:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, but it soon fell again. Japanese naval landing forces have pressed towards Wenzhou along the north and south banks of the river, but as of yesterday, it was still reported that the city remained in Chinese hands. Japanese forces landing on both the north and south banks of the Min River in eastern Fujian Province on Saturday morning captured Lianjiang and Changle on the same day. Chinese observers here predict that the Japanese naval landing forces will withdraw soon. They point out that the Japanese naval authorities may follow the example of other places, and withdraw their troops after occupying port cities. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Relief Committee Allocates Funds for Emergency Relief in Zhejiang and Fujian</p>
<p>Chongqing: With Japanese troops landing on the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang in recent days, the people in the war zone urgently need relief. The Relief Committee has specifically allocated 120,000 yuan, entrusting 60,000 yuan to Wang Xiyin, the committee's resident commissioner in Zhejiang, to handle emergency relief in Lin'an, Shaoxing, and other places, and 60,000 yuan to handle emergency relief in Shipu, Haimen, and Ruian. Another 20,000 yuan has been allocated to the Ningyong General Station to handle the transport and distribution of goods in the Shaoxing area. As for Changle and Lianjiang in Fujian Province, 50,000 yuan has been allocated to the Fujian Provincial Relief Committee, headed by Chen Peikun, to expedite emergency relief, and telegrams have been sent to the provincial governments concerned, requesting them to dispatch personnel to jointly handle the matter. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Sino-Soviet Agreement Reached; Japan Seeks to End the War</p>
<p>Chongqing: The suspension of freight and passenger transport on the Siberian Railway has attracted great interest here. It is generally believed that if Japan has not withdrawn its defensive troops from the Manchurian border, then the Soviet Union's eastern frontier defense troops would certainly not withdraw westward. Roughly, the Soviet Union can withdraw 200,000 troops during this half-month period. Therefore, the number of troops Japan can transfer to China, or is in the process of transferring, can be estimated. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty, the general public originally believed that Japan might first try to resolve the "China Incident." This view seems to have been proven by facts, and looking at the recent battles in the Dahong Mountains of Hubei Province and eastern Zhejiang, one can further discern Japan's intentions. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat from the Foothills of the Dahong Mountains</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) Japanese troops invading the southern foothills of the Dahong Mountains were severely defeated by the Chinese forces in the Bazhe River and Watershed area.

The Japanese fled towards Fangzui. (2) The Japanese invading the northeastern foothills of the Dahong Mountains at Erzugang, Shangjiadian, and other places near Weiping were ambushed by the Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties by the evening of the 15th.

The Relief Committee was instructed to allocate 100,000 yuan to be personally carried back to the province by Li for distribution. However, because Li was busy with official duties and could not make the trip immediately, and also because refugees urgently needed relief after the great victory in northern Jiangxi, he entrusted the bank to remit the 100,000 yuan to Jiangxi yesterday, requesting the Provincial Relief Committee to handle emergency relief on his behalf. Li will wait until his duties are settled before going to the province to convey the Central Government's benevolence. (Dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Balkan Campaign is Drawing to a Close</h3>
<p>The gambling adventures of Germany and Italy in the current Balkan War are nearing the stage of success. The various newspaper commentaries transmitted by British wire services in recent days have largely concluded that the British Expeditionary Force will inevitably withdraw from the Balkans. As the Times said in its editorial: "It must not be forgotten that when the British troops first landed in Greece, it did not form a coalition strong enough to counter the German offensive." The implication here is that the main reason for the failure of this Balkan War is mainly due to Turkey's refusal to cooperate. The Daily Mail pointed out more clearly: "When the Allied Alliance of the three countries in Southern Europe was in despair, it was very willing, we only had failure written all over us." Of course, the fact that the Soviet Union and Turkey did not actively intervene was the biggest reason for the failure of the British, Greek and Southern European countries in this Balkan war; but on the other hand, the reason why the Soviet Union and Turkey have not taken active steps so far must also be attributed to the speed of Germany and Italy's military achievements, that is, the grand effect of the "blitzkrieg".</p>
<p>Reviewing the battle situation for more than two weeks, the British, Greek and Southern European countries have almost always tried to block the advance first, and finally retreated, without any active use; so that the German and Italian aggressor forces have always maintained the offensive and realized their ambitions. This is the biggest reason for the military failure of the British, Greek and Southern European Allied Forces. British Prime Minister Churchill clearly admitted in a speech last week that in the current stage, Britain's assistance to the South and Greece cannot but be limited by many other strategic considerations; all Britain dares to say at present is to reiterate its determination to fight to the end with its allies. In other words, Britain did not concentrate all its forces on the Balkan land to prepare for a decisive battle with Germany and Italy; therefore, the future of the Allied Forces' brave resistance is, of course, bleak. What's more, the internal unrest in the South and Greece accelerated the process of defeat. Moreover, when the German and Italian armies cut off the connection between Greece and Southern Europe, and the connection between Southern Europe, and at the same time divided the South and Greece into sections, the resistance force of Yugoslavia inevitably decreased sharply, and added to the internal wavering, and declared collapse first. As for the reason why Greece is still able to support the situation, it is willing to rely on British assistance; assuming that the British military implements a retreat, then Greece's glorious record this time will have to end here: thereafter, what will cover the entire Balkans is darkness and violence.</p>
<p>When the Balkan Peninsula is submerged in dark clouds, wailing and storms, the anti-aggression war centered on Britain will be moved to the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Near East, Africa, the British Isles, and the Atlantic Ocean, and other possible stages. Assuming the timing and considering previous examples, the success of Germany and Italy's outward expansion in every fragment of space will be accompanied by a stagnation in every fragment of time. After this Balkan campaign, when and where the next scene will be unveiled is difficult to judge at present. However, in recent days, the main object on which Germany and Italy have chosen to exert pressure in the next scene seems to have some clues that can be explored. Assuming that the exploration is not bad, then Turkey, Spain, and the Vichy government of France will unfortunately be selected in turn. Indeed, the attitude of all these countries, whether they are accommodating or resisting, has a very important relationship with Germany and Italy's future strategy.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Turkey. Apart from the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy have now controlled the entire European continent, and the only piece of clean land left is the European part of Turkey. What is important is that Turkey's geographical location is extremely important in all future developments. The best shortcut for Germany and Italy to strike at the British Empire is through Turkey; even if not, they must first arrange their relationship with Turkey properly if they bypass Turkey from the African side to reach the Near East or India. At the same time, the attitude of the countries in the Near East is also greatly affected by Turkey's position: and the future destiny of French Syria may depend on Turkey's actions.</p>
<p>In addition to Turkey, another way for Germany and Italy to invade Africa is through Spain and capture Gibraltar. Here, Germany and Italy can obtain the narrowest water surface on the Mediterranean Sea and cross over to Africa; and it can also give a fatal threat to the Mediterranean Sea, the lifeline of the British Empire. In the European War for more than a year, Germany and Italy have never stopped coercing and enticing Spain; and no matter whether their negotiations with Turkey can succeed in the future, their activities towards Spain will definitely become countless times more intense.</p>
<p>In addition to Turkey and Spain, Germany and Italy will inevitably intensify their pressure on the Vichy government of France. What they are coveting under what pretext, of course, is the French naval fleet.</p>
<p>In summary, although Germany and Italy's army and air force have achieved remarkable results, their navy is very clearly at a disadvantage against the British navy; therefore, if they want to further strike at the British Empire, they must find a land passage, or use all methods to increase their own naval strength. This is also the reason why Japan in the Far East was able to act before Germany and Italy.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in the Far East; US Sends Troops to the Philippines; Manila Becomes a Strong Far Eastern Fortress; US to Intensify Aid to China to Check Japan</h3>
<p>Manila: The US transport ship "Republic" docked in Manila Bay today, and 17 US officers and 2,058 soldiers from Fort Mason, California, disembarked. This troop contingent is the largest US detachment to arrive in the Orient for the first time. Most of these soldiers will be stationed on Corregidor, the largest fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay and the strongest US defense east of Hawaii. The arrival of these troops has led the general public to pay close attention to the fact that the US is now engaged in military construction in the Philippines at a rate many times greater than that undertaken in the forty years since the Philippines was acquired from Spain. Furthermore, seven US Navy construction engineers arrived here yesterday from the United States aboard a Clipper, indicating that the United States is intensifying its establishment of defenses in the Philippines. All construction for the US Army garrison is proceeding busily, as barracks, storage facilities, factories, and aircraft hangars must be completed before the monsoon season in mid-June. The Philippine Daily News, commenting on the arrival of these troops, stated that history never repeats itself. Forty years ago, US troops came here to conquer, and subsequently brought Filipinos the great friendship of rulers and ruled. The people of the Philippines no longer resent the US troops arriving here today. It is reported that the ship "Washington" will bring 2,200 US troops here in early May.

<p>Manila: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned to Tokyo today, and attention is also focused on Japan. Observers are watching for signs of a revival of Japan's southward expansion policy. Responsible parties in Manila, Batavia, and Singapore feel that if Japan seizes the opportunity presented by the Axis powers' offensive in Europe to adjust its policies or expand its "New Order in East Asia," incidents will occur in the Far East no later than June. This feeling is widespread, so although the US government has not yet advised civilians to evacuate the Philippines, there has been a gradual increase in women and children leaving the Philippines to return to the United States. The Army and Navy have ordered the families of officers and soldiers on active duty to return home. The prevailing consensus here is that if Britain shows significant signs of collapse, causing the United States to shift its attention from the East, Japan will seize the opportunity to demand substantial concessions from the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, or even Australia. Military circles point out that Japan's reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict may be the right to transit through Thailand to deploy troops to attack British Malaya. Britain's recent increase in troops in Malaya clearly reflects the possibility of this eventuality. Although officials have remained silent after the recent talks between British, American, and Dutch officials here, the signs of close cooperation between the Eastern garrisons of the three countries are very evident. Last week, Singapore received a shipment of naval repair supplies, which were clearly not intended for British ships. British naval bombers are now flying across the Pacific to Cavite, where they are received by British personnel and flown to Singapore. While the British personnel are waiting here, they are entertained by the US Navy at Cavite. The US Army recently sent military observers to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Thailand for the first time. The Asiatic Fleet has postponed its summer visit to China, or at least until mid-July, and the northern cruise may be abandoned altogether, indicating the importance of the US Navy's patrols in Philippine territorial waters. The Asiatic Fleet is currently conducting large-scale exercises in the southern Philippine territorial waters. Today, the transport ship "Republic" brought 2,075 army personnel here, the largest group in any shipment of troops to date. Another 2,000 people will arrive in Manila aboard the "Washington." Two teams of carpenters from each US Army station are working in shifts to build new barracks to accommodate this new group of troops. The Chongqing Chinese government's plan to continue resisting Japan is largely based on the expectation of increased supplies from the United States. Although reliable statistics on the US supplies already shipped to Rangoon are not available, the best-informed sources believe there is a sufficient quantity to encourage China to continue its resistance. On the other hand, some believe that these supplies are too few to significantly impact the final outcome of the war. If the Chongqing government wants to have any hope of winning against a Japanese offensive, it needs not only an increased supply of new weapons and supplies, but also time and technical assistance to train Chinese troops to use these weapons. In the current situation, observers believe that China can at best maintain the status quo without collapsing, preventing a large number of Japanese troops stationed in China from being diverted elsewhere.

<p>Washington: Yesterday, unofficial sources here stated that the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands may have reached an informal understanding regarding actions to be taken if Japan moves south. However, it is said that there is no written agreement. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he had no knowledge of a written agreement between Britain, the United States, and Eastern countries, as reported in Japanese newspapers. Japanese sources stated that Britain, India, Australia, China, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States have established a defense agreement, but the report did not mention the contents of the agreement. Some time ago, Britain proposed allowing US warships unrestricted use of Singapore in wartime or peacetime. Well-informed sources here say that this proposal will undoubtedly be part of any Far Eastern defense agreement. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Completes Mission, Returns to Ottawa; US Supplies Canada with Military Equipment Under Lend-Lease; Canada and the US Jointly Defend Greenland</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Prime Minister King recently declared that if Greenland and Iceland are invaded, Canada will dispatch troops to defend them in conjunction with relevant countries. We were fully aware in advance of the US government's establishment of air and naval bases in Greenland. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King has returned here from the United States. While in the US, he reached an agreement with the United States on the joint development of Canadian resources, so this trip was definitely not just a vacation. Officials expect that the agreement reached will be of great benefit to both parties, and the wartime Canadian exchange rate problem has been resolved as a result. According to general interpretations here, the United States will use more Canadian raw materials and supply Canada with military supplies and ammunition under the Lend-Lease Act for shipment to Britain. In this way, Canada will not have to worry about a shortage of US dollars. In the past twelve months, Canada's trade deficit with the US is estimated by non-official sources to be worth approximately $125,000,000. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: After the US government signed an agreement with the Canadian federation yesterday, political figures here stated that this agreement is essentially the US providing material assistance to the Canadian federation in accordance with the "Aid to Democratic Nations Act." The US government will continue to purchase copper, nickel, radium, zinc, aluminum, and various chemical supplies from the Canadian federation, and in return, Canada will purchase armaments from the US without having to pay cash. The details specified in this agreement are extremely detailed and were drafted by experts. It is also psychologically important and will further strengthen the ties between the US and the Canadian federation. For example, the New York Sun reported, "The establishment of this agreement, from the US perspective, is tantamount to mobilizing national resources to strengthen national defense, and from Canada's perspective, it can be seen as mobilizing national resources to engage in warfare." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King said yesterday, "The declaration in Hyde Park is North America's response to Adolf Hitler's birthday celebration." It is also reported that President and Mrs. Roosevelt have agreed to visit Ottawa in early May. King also mentioned the statement he and President Roosevelt issued on Sunday evening, saying that the US and Canada will exchange military supplies and will jointly accelerate the defense of the Western Hemisphere and aid to Britain. King said that this agreement is "mobilizing the resources of the Americas to defeat Hitler." (International dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Yarnell's Appointment as Philippine Commissioner</h3>
<p>Manila: News from high administrative circles has been continuously circulating here today, stating that if the current US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, is transferred to another position here, his successor will be Vice Admiral Yarnell. However, this news does not indicate that the White House has made a decision, only that the White House has expressed interest in Yarnell, the former commander of the Asiatic Fleet.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Holds Special Meeting to Hear Matsuoka's Report; Review of Foreign Policy to be Conducted</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will arrive in Tokyo today to report on his negotiations with Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, so that the government can review Japan's entire foreign policy. Japanese sources say that the Japan-Soviet treaty and the strengthening of the Tripartite Pact will help Japan's position in the Far East. All parties are concerned about future relations with Britain and the United States. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Cabinet is scheduled to hold a special meeting tomorrow to hear Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's report on his trip to Europe and the Soviet-Japanese treaty. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived at Tachikawa Military Airport this afternoon, where he was greeted by many high-ranking government officials. After disembarking, Matsuoka immediately traveled by car to the Prime Minister's official residence. After reporting to the Prime Minister and other cabinet members, Matsuoka hosted Japanese newspaper reporters, and then met with foreign reporters before entering the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor. One foreign correspondent asked about the reported withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Far East after the conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact. Matsuoka replied that this matter should be asked of Molotov or Stalin. According to the Japanese disclosure of the conversation, Matsuoka answered that everything was public and there were no conditions to speak of in response to a question about whether there were any conditions attached to the signing of the Japanese-Soviet neutrality pact. Both sides understand that the conclusion of this agreement will allow for the rapid resolution of various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. We must act quickly to deal with the current major needs. We should not confuse prudence with procrastination. The Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact and declaration do not affect the Tripartite Pact, just as the Tripartite Pact does not affect the relations of the three countries with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka also said that he did not intend to say anything more before reporting to the Emperor. When asked if he was prepared to conclude a non-aggression pact with the United States, Matsuoka shrugged without answering. When asked if he planned to take any diplomatic action towards the United States, he replied that it would be unwise to publish any plans before they matured. Matsuoka only spent five minutes meeting with foreign reporters and essentially refused to answer each question clearly. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Information Bureau said that they had only heard news reports regarding the rumored military agreement concluded by China, Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies, and had not received any official confirmation.

<p>Washington: Treasury officials said yesterday that the $50 million Chinese stabilization fund agreement will be signed today or Wednesday. The agreement will be signed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Bank of China Chairman T.V. Soong. Treasury officials said that all negotiations have been completed and that only the drafting of the best form of the agreement was being done yesterday.

<p>Honolulu: President Roosevelt's eldest son, James, accompanied by Captain Thomas, flew from here to the Far East yesterday to serve in the US Marine Corps. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: President Roosevelt's eldest son, James Roosevelt, is expected to arrive here in a few days. According to Chongqing sources, Roosevelt left Honolulu on Sunday to come to the provisional capital. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Minor Issues Between the US and the Soviet Union Partially Resolved</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the scope of the neutrality treaty concluded by the Soviet Union and Japan is not as broad as generally imagined. As for the talks between the State Department and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, they only involved various minor issues, some of which have been resolved. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>US Ship Bound for Greece Destroyed En Route; State Department Now Studying US Navy Escort Plan</h3>
<p>Washington: According to reports last night, a US ship carrying $125,000 worth of Red Cross relief supplies intended for Greece has been destroyed. The first US ship carrying $2,000,000 is missing. This is the first time since the beginning of the war that Red Cross relief supplies have been lost due to the war. Red Cross officials said, "Three weeks ago, the Greek cargo ship Grigore, carrying medicine, blankets, clothing, and food, intended to unload in Greece, disappeared somewhere in the South Atlantic." They also said that they do not know if the ship was sunk by a mine or a torpedo. Also, another Greek cargo ship, the Rulukis, carrying $2,000,000 worth of Red Cross food, disappeared on its way to Greece four weeks ago. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department began to actively consider the issue of US Navy escorts for US ships yesterday. This is the first time that any part of the government other than the Navy Department has given serious consideration to this controversial issue. State Department experts have decided that it is perfectly legal for US Navy ships to escort US ships carrying supplies to Britain if they do not enter the war zone. However, it has also been considered that if they are carrying contraband, German warships still have the right to intercept, search, and temporarily detain such ships. The weakness of Germany's lack of warships to patrol the high seas is something that can be exploited. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Massively Collecting US Securities</h3>
<p>London: The British Treasury has now requisitioned another 164 types of US securities, with payment due on June 2. Since March 1940, the British Treasury has now requisitioned a total of 561 types of US securities. The most recent requisition includes 69 types of common stock, 56 types of preferred stock, and 39 types of bonds. The requisition includes not only well-known stocks, but also some bankrupt stocks, which shows the extent to which the British Treasury is collecting dollar securities. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Darlan Visits Paris Again; Seeks Resolution of Franco-German Issues; Rumors of Germany Offering Prisoner Release in Exchange for Closer Franco-German Cooperation</h3>
<p>Vichy: Vice Premier Darlan plans to make another trip to Paris within days to conduct important talks with German authorities. Recalling that after Vice Premier Darlan's last trip to Paris, German Ambassador to France Abetz promptly returned to Berlin to consult with the German government in order to continue discussions with Vice Premier Darlan on various outstanding issues between France and Germany. After the departure of the previous Vice Premier Laval, the newspapers in occupied France listed various issues and demanded that measures be taken immediately to resolve them. The most important of these were: (1) Readjusting the borders between occupied and free France, (2) Reducing France's burden of supplying provisions to the German garrison in occupied France, (3) Releasing French prisoners of war who are farmers first. Subsequently, due to Germany's focus on the Balkans, there was no time for further discussion of the above issues. But at this point, the international situation has entered a new stage, and it is hoped that the outstanding issues between France and Germany can be resolved in the shortest possible time. In addition, Vice Premier Darlan recently accompanied Marshal Pétain on an inspection tour of the Pyrenees region in the southwest, and the people along the way expressed their complete trust, deeply moving the Marshal himself. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Vichy: It was learned here this morning that Hitler had sent a private letter to French Marshal Pétain, proposing "closer cooperation" as a prelude to lasting peace. At the same time, rumors spread that pro-German politician Laval may soon re-enter a partially reorganized cabinet. (Berlin sources said, "Although Laval's re-entry into the Vichy cabinet is undoubtedly necessary, it is not yet time to make various speculations about this possibility.") It is noteworthy that these rumors arose two days after an emergency cabinet meeting was convened in Madrid, where it was said that Spain's role in this war would be more clearly defined and that the status of Gibraltar would be affected. It is rumored that Hitler suggested to France the release and return of 500,000 French prisoners as part of a Franco-German close cooperation plan, and that these French prisoners are mostly farmers. (International News Service dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Reports that Hitler recently sent a telegram to French Marshal Pétain have been denied by the Foreign Ministry, which stated that the liaison between the French and German governments is the responsibility of French Vice Premier, Foreign Minister, Interior Minister, and Navy Minister Darlan, and German Ambassador to France Abetz, and that the talks between the two sides are proceeding smoothly. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London: According to news from the French border, Vichy is discussing the possibility of reshuffling the Pétain cabinet. German gains in North Africa and the Balkans appear to have strengthened the position of those who advocate closer cooperation with Germany, but Laval may not be recalled to the cabinet, as Laval is still not trusted by the public. It is possible that Laval will be appointed ambassador to Paris to replace Brinon. If so, Laval will expedite the cooperation of the French delegation with the Armistice Commission, which will move from Wiesbaden to Paris. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Envoy Craigie Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Discusses Routine Matters</h3>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has repeatedly met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ohashi recently. When the Information Bureau spokesman met with reporters today, someone asked about this matter. It was answered that routine matters such as shipping issues were being discussed. An American reporter asked whether Japan would take similar action in East Asia to deal with the United States, as the United States is now encouraging Latin American countries to curb exports to Japan. The spokesman replied that if necessary, Japan would be forced to do so. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Prisoners Attempt Escape; All Captured</h3>
<p>Camp Iroquois, Canada: According to unconfirmed reports received here, all 28 German prisoners who escaped recently have been apprehended. According to previous official reports, only six escaped.

<h3>Balkans Under Nazi Control; New Developments in European War; World's Eyes on Germany's Future Moves; German Pressure on Spain to Join Axis</h3>
<p>Military observers in Vichy recently stated that the Greek war is coming to an end. The main issue now is to pay attention to what actions the Axis powers will take after occupying the entire Balkan Peninsula (excluding Turkey). In general, in the future, the European Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea, and the Aegean Sea coastal areas will be under the control of Germany and Italy. The only exception is the European part of Turkey. In short, the Greek and North African wars are a stage in the current European war. It is expected that in the near future, the entire situation will undergo major developments. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to London sources here, British political figures are now quite concerned about the situation in the western Mediterranean. The Spanish cabinet's continuous meetings for two days have made London political circles feel very apprehensive. Although it is not yet possible to know what the Spanish government's decision will be, British political circles are deeply worried that the situation in the western Mediterranean will cause complex changes. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: It is widely rumored that Germany is heavily pressuring Spain to join the Axis powers in order to capture Gibraltar, or at least to close the Strait of Gibraltar. Germany has already placed artillery within Spanish territory on both sides of Gibraltar. If it can be used, it is tantamount to the area being in German hands. It is not yet known whether Germany will transport a large number of troops into famine-stricken Spain, causing transportation and food difficulties. However, a more practical approach seems to be to use artillery units only around Gibraltar. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Under Nazi Air Raids, British and Greek Allied Forces Continue to Retreat South, Establishing a New Line of Defense South of Lamia; German Troops Less Than 100 Miles from Athens</h3>
<p>London - According to the latest news received by the British military headquarters in Cairo, the British forces in Greece are continuing a systematic retreat and have now withdrawn from Larissa and Trikala. However, the German forces have not broken through the Allied line of defense at any point. The current battle situation remains serious and is not expected to ease within a day or two. The German forces have advanced into Greece at a significant cost. The British military headquarters announced yesterday that British troops were ordered to retreat to a new position and are continuing to retreat under constant bombardment. This retreat is nearing completion. The enemy's advance is very cautious, due to the poor road conditions and the fact that they are met with heavy resistance every time they engage with British troops. British casualties are light. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - It has been officially announced that the British Imperial forces in Greece have established a defensive position south of Lamia, 50 miles south of Larissa. Military officials stressed that the German forces have suffered extremely heavy losses in recent operations in Greece. The retreat of the British and Greek forces to the new position is due to the German forces defeating the South Slav forces and breaking through the Monastir Gap, threatening the rear of the British and Greek forces. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital - After news of the Greek situation reached here, people from all walks of life, although considering the situation in the Balkan Peninsula to be very serious, believe that even if the German forces exert pressure, the British and Greek Allied forces will still put up effective resistance without a doubt. It is said that the British and Greek military authorities have already prepared to withdraw the Allied forces to semi-Egypt in case of emergency. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Foreign observers now increasingly believe that the British army must evacuate Greece, but it is extremely difficult to say whether they can avoid heavy personnel and material losses. Berlin claims that the British army has begun to withdraw and that five British troop carriers have been sunk by aircraft. Commentators say that the British aid to Greece was an extremely difficult move that could not be avoided on moral grounds. All observers unanimously acknowledge that although the British army fights bravely, it is outnumbered, and its military strategy is far inferior to that of Germany. The precision and sharpness of German machinery are undoubtedly superior. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Berlin War Report Announces the Capture of Lamia</h3>
<p>Berlin - German troops operating in Greece yesterday captured the port of Volos in Thessaly and the city of Lamia, an important town in southern Thessaly, guarding the strategic Thermopylae pass. The fall of the city is particularly unfavorable for the Greek army. (Haiyong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command recently stated that the spearhead of the German motorized unit has penetrated to within only ninety miles of Athens and is poised to encircle the entire left wing of the Greek forces at Piraeus. This information was revealed in the German High Command's announcement of the capture of Lamia and Ioannina by German forces. Lamia was captured by the German motorized unit, which, in the middle of the week, had caused a six-mile-wide gap in the New Zealand forces' defensive position between the Aegean Sea and Mount Olympus, and had pushed through the Thessalian Plain from Larissa, approaching the third major British and Greek line of defense. These German troops are now only a few miles away from the historically significant Thermopylae Pass, where the Greeks defeated the Persian army in 480 BC. In addition to the rapid advance in southern Greece, its mechanized units, after fierce fighting, have reached the important seaport of Volos. Even though the highway bridges in the Lamia area were destroyed, the German motorized unit has deeply penetrated Lamia. German troops crossing the Pindus Mountains to the west have occupied Ioannina and have taken control of the main retreat route of the British and Greek Allied forces. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Inhumanely Indiscriminately Bomb Innocent Civilians</h3>
<p>Athens - Last night, the Greek Ministry of Public Security issued a public statement stating that German aircraft bombed Greek territory, and the suburbs of Athens were also affected. The Germans used machine guns to strafe residents of Akori, causing some casualties. Bombs were dropped on various villages in the regions of Korinth and Missolonghi, as well as places where refugees were concentrated. The Gulf of Euboea was also bombed. The public statement also stated that German aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs during the air raid on the port of Piraeus, resulting in civilian casualties and destruction of houses. Multiple bombs also fell on the outskirts of Eleusis. Furthermore, on Sunday, various islands and cities were subjected to air raids all day long, but only two residents were injured. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Istanbul - The Greek Chalki radio station suddenly stopped broadcasting yesterday. According to news received here, the radio station has been destroyed by German bombing. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The General Command recently issued a war report stating that after the British army was defeated and retreated from the Thessalian Plain in Greece, our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, giving them no chance to catch their breath. Our bombers continued to bomb the ports of Volos and Chalkis. Our air groups sank two British merchant ships totaling 2,000 tons, all transport ships, and severely damaged two others totaling 12,000 tons, in the seas off the Greek islands of Crete and Euboea. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battles Over Athens, 16 German Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>Cairo - The British Air Force achieved its greatest victory since the German attack on Greece on Sunday, shooting down at least 16 German aircraft. Fourteen of these were shot down when a large formation of German aircraft engaged in a major battle with British fighters over Athens. These included seven Stuka dive bombers and five Messerschmitt fighters, with one remaining unidentified. Several other German aircraft were also heavily damaged, making them unable to return to base. Seven British aircraft did not return, but it is known that three of the pilots are unharmed. The public statement stated that the British airfields suffered slight damage. On Saturday night, British bombers attacked enemy airfields and advancing enemy columns. The enemy airfield in Katellani was bombed heavily by British heavy bombers, causing a large fire. Aircraft in the Cyrenaica region continued to attack the enemy and its transport convoys and airfields. On the same night, British aircraft fiercely attacked Derna, Benghazi, and Gazala. Due to the dense clouds, it is not known what damage was inflicted. Malta was attacked twice on Sunday, with no damage or casualties. British fighters took off to intercept, shooting down three enemy aircraft and heavily damaging several others. The pilots of the three destroyed enemy aircraft parachuted into the sea. In addition to the seven aircraft missing in Greece, two British bombers also failed to return to base. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>New Greek Prime Minister Takes Office, Declares Resolve to Resist, Calls on the Entire Nation to Unite Strongly and Continue to Fight to Defend Freedom</h3>
<p>Istanbul - King George of Greece originally intended to serve concurrently as Prime Minister, but has now abandoned this idea and appointed Souteros as Prime Minister. The new Prime Minister will also serve concurrently as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Economy. Lieutenant General Sakellariou will remain in his position as assistant. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Athens - Greek Foreign Minister Souteros has been appointed Prime Minister, succeeding Kikritzis. Souteros was sworn in yesterday. Subsequently, Athens Radio Station broadcast his message to the public, stating that the current government will, without hesitation, assume the administration of the country and continue the national resistance until victory is achieved. Only after Greece, the Balkans, and Europe are freed from the shackles of the aggressor will the entire nation continue to fight. It is hoped that the people of the country will summon their courage and ensure that there is no one in Greece who is dejected. The people of the country should trust in the final victory and remain calm and undisturbed during this national crisis. After praising the Greek soldiers who died in battle, Souteros praised the British people, saying that the British are fighting for Greece to uphold justice. Behind Britain, the United States is holding aloft the inextinguishable torch of freedom. The people of the world are moved by this light and will eventually gather their strength to seek their mutual unity and organization, to pass on the crimes of the dark ages that destroyed freedom and peace. With the strength of this allied country and our country, we will surely be able to restore justice. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Italian Governor of Abyssinia Refuses British Surrender Offer, Replies That He Will Fight to the Last Man, Says Britain Should Be Responsible for Protecting White People</h3>
<p>Rome - A public statement was issued stating that the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Duke of Aosta, has completely rejected the British surrender offer and replied to the British forces in Dire Dawa, "The Italian army will fight to the last man." The British surrender offer was based on the reason of protecting civilian lives. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian official news agency stated that the Italian Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Abyssinia, Duke of Aosta, has refused the request made by British General Cunningham that the Italian army should lay down their arms and surrender, and assured Mussolini that he will lead his troops to struggle everywhere until his death. The news agency also stated that this request was made during discussions on the protection of white people in Abyssinia. General Cunningham told the Italian envoy that if the British side has to bear the responsibility of protecting white people, then the Italian army should lay down their arms and surrender. Upon hearing this, Aosta requested written confirmation. Cunningham sent a letter confirming his verbal statement. Aosta then replied as follows: "I have not considered the military suggestion made by Your Excellency, and I reject it outright. From the time that the British army or the indigenous army you have trained occupies the residential areas of white people, Your Excellency will be responsible for treating white people well."

<h3>Romania Brewing Civil War, Rumored Soviet Union Secretly Orchestrating, Romanian Prime Minister's Position Shaken</h3>
<p>London - It is rumored that the civil war in Romania incited by the Soviet Union is now generally considered inevitable. According to knowledgeable sources here, this action by the Soviet Union has a dual purpose: on the one hand, to prevent the German army's advance in the Balkans, and on the other hand, to help promote the "world revolution." It is expected that the result may be that Germany will completely occupy the two countries of Romania and Bulgaria. It is rumored that secret political police teams carrying paratroopers and mechanized units have concentrated on the Romanian border, preparing to intervene and "restore order." It is believed that the true purpose of the Soviet Union is to provoke a revolution and delay the German attack on India. According to news here, Germany is currently preparing a coup in Afghanistan to reinstate the former King Amanullah, who is now in Berlin. (International News, 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest - German sources all predict that Romania, in order to end its internal strife, may become a German protectorate, similar to Slovakia. Semi-official Hungarian sources accuse the Soviet Union of instigating the Iron Guard to resist Germany, in order to create an excuse for the Soviet Union to occupy Moldavia. These sources said that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has become a lone wolf because Germany does not support him. Therefore, it seems that Horia Sima, the leader of the pro-German Iron Guard who is now in exile in Germany, may rise to replace him. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Budapest - According to news from Hungary yesterday, the government formed by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has become shaky, as the government has lost the support of Germany and is threatened. It is also rumored here that Soviet troops have concentrated on the Moldavian border, and it is said that all transportation between Hungary and Romania has been suspended. The Romanian National Defense Force occasionally shoots at Hungarian troops who cross into Romania. The source also said that Romanian President Antonescu will lose the support of Germany as a result of disputes over the adjustment of Balkan lands, and that Soviet troops are prepared to enter the province of Moldavia in Romania once Romania disintegrates.

<h3>Axis Military and Political Leaders Meet in Vienna to Plan New Map of the Balkans; Bulgarian Army Continues to Occupy Southern Greek Territory</h3>
<p>Vienna - Today's news reports that Axis military and political leaders are currently holding a meeting in or near Vienna to plan a new map of the Balkans. The borders of this new map may be announced within a few days. This new map includes Yugoslavia, Greece, and Axis satellites bordering these countries. It is being planned by German and Italian leaders and representatives from Hungary, Bulgaria, and the "New State of Croatia." The number one figure planning is Hitler. It is said that Hitler, in a meeting with Bulgarian King Boris, who is visiting the German leader, has roughly delineated the borders of the "New Balkans." Other key figures participating in the meeting include Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. This new map may historically be called "the territory of Southeastern Europe determined by the Belgrade Conference" and will replace the map drawn up by the Allies after the previous European war. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy - The French news agency reported from Berlin that the Axis powers seized land in the Balkan Peninsula, with the Vardar River as the boundary. The land between the Struma and Maritsa rivers in the Thrace region of Greece is now also occupied by the Bulgarian army. (Note: The port of Dedeagach in this occupied area has long been a demand of Bulgaria to have access to the Aegean Sea. It is believed that the Bulgarian army's occupation of the above two areas is only a preliminary step, and they may soon occupy more areas. The new border is expected to be determined at the meeting to be held in Vienna tomorrow. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have met several times yesterday to prepare for this meeting. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav King Peter Flees to Jerusalem, Farewell Declaration Does Not Give Up the Struggle, Plane Attacked En Route, One Cabinet Member Dies</h3>
<p>Istanbul - According to news from Jerusalem, King Peter II of Yugoslavia and Prime Minister General Simović have arrived in Jerusalem. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to a French news agency report from Jerusalem, King Peter of Yugoslavia has fled from Athens to Jerusalem. Those traveling with him include Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović and the Foreign Minister, while Croatian leader and Deputy Prime Minister Maček remains in Croatia. According to Swiss radio news, King Peter of Yugoslavia and others were attacked while flying from Athens to Jerusalem, passing over the Mediterranean Sea. One cabinet member died. Before leaving the capital, King Peter issued a farewell message to the people of the country, saying, "I will not give up the struggle, but will continue to fight so that I can return victorious. Although I am forced to temporarily leave the country due to being overwhelmed by superior enemy forces, this does not mean giving up the struggle. The honor of our national flag has been preserved. I will follow the example of my ancestors and hold high the Yugoslav flag until my death. My flight with the government does not mean that the legitimate representatives of the country have surrendered." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Warships Gather in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Algeciras - Aircraft from the aircraft carrier "HMS Ark Royal," anchored in the port of Gibraltar, conducted exercises yesterday. At the same time, a British battleship arrived at the port. Currently, there is one aircraft carrier, three battleships, one cruiser, and one squadron each of destroyers and submarines in the port. In addition, there are many merchant ships and speedboats, preparing to form a merchant fleet. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Nazi Air Force Night Raid on England, Plymouth as Target</h3>
<p>Berlin - Elite units of the German Air Force attacked Plymouth, an important British naval port, last night. Explosions occurred everywhere, and large fires broke out in various factories and shipyards. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation announced that German aircraft attacked southwestern England last night for a short period of time, but one city was the main target of the bombing. Fires broke out in several places, but they were quickly extinguished and did not spread. Although the bombing was very fierce, the damage and casualties were not as significant as in previous attacks. Bombs also fell on East Anglia, with minimal damage and few casualties. According to news from the German official news agency, German aircraft bombed Portsmouth last night. British fighters shot down a four-engine bomber over an airfield in northern France. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Troops Continue to Land in Iraq; Soviet-Iranian Border Peaceful</h3>
<p>Stockholm - According to a cable from the London correspondent of the "Svenska Dagbladet," British troops continue to land in Iraq. It is learned that Britain will send more troops to Iraq, with the intention of occupying the entire country of Iraq. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Beirut - According to news from the capital of Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Gailani declared to a delegation of Iraqi citizens yesterday that any attempt to undermine Iraq's security and independence would provoke a swift response. Gailani did not mention the landing of British troops in Iraq. According to responsible sources, the number of British troops landing in Basra is about 2,000. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tehran - According to a semi-official Iranian newspaper, rumors circulating abroad that Iranian troops have concentrated on the northern border are not true. Although the Soviet Union is conducting military exercises on the border, Iran is not concentrating troops, and the Soviet-Iranian border remains unobstructed. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Turkey - Political figures here speculate that the British military landing in Basra may be to cover the British retreat from Egypt, or to occupy Syria. After all, Britain's position in Egypt will not be tenable for long, and there is only one remaining route for retreat, which is through Palestine and Iraq to the Persian Gulf, attempting to retreat to India. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Asks United States to Recall Military Attaché, Citing Exceeding Authority</h3>
<p>Rome - Responsible sources here declared yesterday that the Italian government's request that the US authorities recall the US military and air attaché to the Italian embassy, Mr. Bartley, was not in retaliation for the US request that Italy withdraw Italian Naval Attaché to the US, Admiral Les. Rather, it was because Bartley exceeded his authority and engaged in activities in a belligerent country that violated the status of a neutral official. Therefore, the decision was made to request the United States to recall him. Les, on the other hand, had not exceeded his authority in any way in the United States. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>European War Talks (4)(6)</p>
<h3>An Overview of the American Navy</h3>
<p>There are two types of sailors: one who spends his time on the deck, and another who spends his days in the engine room. Regardless of whether they are second-class seamen or third-class firemen, they receive a salary of 36 US dollars after twelve weeks of training. Their responsibilities include managing shipboard chores, serving as mine personnel, radio operators, mechanics, etc., all of which are the most basic corporals. When they enlist again at the age of twenty-five, they start as privates and gradually rise in rank, earning 100 US dollars per month. At this point, they can get married and settle down. Sailors can rise to the rank of petty officer, and retire at the age of forty-five with a pension of 1,400 US dollars. The sailor profession may not seem particularly promising, and seafaring involves being far from home, but in reality, the monthly allowance and retirement pay add up to a considerable sum. Moreover, one can rise to the highest rank of petty officer, which, while not bringing glory to one's ancestors, is sufficient to ensure a life free from want.</p>
<p>In the navies of various countries around the world, promotion of officers is primarily based on seniority and years of service, and the same is true in the American Navy. Officers must undergo long periods of training to earn their future. There is only one exception: during wartime, exceptionally meritorious service can lead to surprisingly rapid promotion. The "Annapolis" Naval Academy is the birthplace of officers of all ranks in the American Navy. All personnel involved in designing and building ships, and organizing warships for combat, come from this school.</p>
<p>Graduates of "Annapolis" begin their careers in the Navy as lieutenants with gold stripes. The final stage for the aforementioned sailors is the starting point for these graduates. They must spend seven years at sea. First, they spend three or four years studying various important components on battleships. Then, they spend three years practicing on destroyers or submarines. After these seven years, they earn the title of lieutenant and are reassigned to shore duty to pursue specialized studies at naval officer schools. At the age of thirty, they are reassigned to ships, serving as naval captains.</p>
<p>After this, they undergo rigorous screening, as the position of rear admiral is very rare and precious. This screening is difficult to pass. Of the four hundred students in a class, at least twenty-five percent will have been eliminated by this stage. By the time they are thirty-seven, only one hundred and fifty remain qualified for the position of naval major; by the age of forty-three, the number is even smaller, with only eighty serving as naval lieutenant colonels. Forty of these are assigned to serve as captains of various ships, and the number who will achieve the ultimate goal of rear admiral will be less than ten. The specialized field of study they choose also has an impact on their position. Traditionally, gunnery ranks first. Specializing in aviation at Pensacola is also a shortcut to success at present. Other fields, such as diplomacy, architecture, engineering, strategy, and law, are also broadly covered in the Navy.</p>
<p>An officer's future depends not only on his talent, but also on his integrity and character. Congressional laws recognize him as a proper gentleman, entitled to a title before his name. On board, he is entitled to a private cabin and a servant at his beck and call. The officers' wardroom has a "private club" for relaxation. The salary and various allowances can reach 4,000 US dollars, enough to marry and start a family.</p>
<p>In the current emergency, the promotion of these lieutenants and captains is often surprisingly rapid if they achieve meritorious service. Perhaps in a few months, they can jump to the rank of major, which would normally take seven years to achieve in peacetime. If they perform exceptionally during combat, the position of lieutenant colonel can be obtained without having to wait six years. Finally, they can be promoted to the rank of general, with a flag on the ship, managing a fleet, and retiring as a rear admiral at the age of sixty-four. According to naval custom, the sons of rear admirals often "follow in their father's footsteps" and enter the Navy.</p>
<p>Due to the expansion of the military, the United States Navy urgently needs a large number of officers in both oceans. Although the authorities have recalled retirees and shortened the training period at "Annapolis" to three years, the current need for 25,000 personnel has not been met. In addition to military academies, the United States Department of the Navy has also established reserve training centers in various locations to supplement the personnel from military academies.</p>
<p>A glimpse of naval reserve training, sailors sleeping in hammocks</p>
<p>(6) Naval Bases</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Mahan of the United States Navy once said, "A navy is composed of personnel, ships, and bases, the most important of which are personnel, ships, and bases." Naval bases are the lifeblood of all sizes of warships and are of great significance. Modern naval fleets can never operate more than 2,500 miles away from their naval bases. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council's Administration Temporarily Managed by the Old Board of Directors; Temporary Board of Directors Difficult to Establish Soon; No Definite Reply from the Consular Body</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that, according to sources in official circles today (the 22nd), the temporary board of directors passed by the special meeting of taxpayers of the Public Concession last week will be difficult to establish soon. The biggest reason is due to the opposition of the Chinese government. A spokesman for the Municipal Council stated today that the consuls of various countries here will announce their decisions on this matter soon. However, before a decision is made, the administration of the Public Concession will continue to be managed by the current Board of Directors. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday (the 21st), but the contents of the meeting are unknown. Former Chairman Cornabe is about to leave Shanghai, so yesterday's meeting was chaired by Mitchell. Danish Consul General and Dean of the Consular Body Hill stated this morning that he does not know when the consuls of various countries here will be able to give a definite reply on the issue of the temporary board of directors. There is nothing to announce on this issue at present, but a formal statement may be issued soon.</p>
<p>MacDonald's Speech Published</p>
<p>At the special meeting of taxpayers on the 17th of this month, when the proposal of Cornabe and Okamoto to change the organization of the Municipal Council and establish a temporary board of directors was discussed, only MacDonald opposed the proposal. He gave a speech, which, although humorous, failed to win the support of the attendees. However, he was the only one who spoke out loudly about this matter. MacDonald's speech was published by the Municipal Council's Information Office last night. It is translated below: "Mr. Chairman and comrades, I call you so because, politically and municipally, you and your future have encountered the most serious and difficult problem. If I am prohibited from speaking midway and unable to express my opinions, as I was last year, then I will fundamentally and forever oppose this resolution. In my view, this resolution is the most terrible 'abortion' in human thought, a cursed and cruel resolution. You also know its importance. Most of you, or at least a part of you, have probably read Mr. Cornabe's speech, which is like the thinnest layer of sugar coating the most poisonous medicine, and is something I have never seen before. Verbal guarantees have no legal binding force and are as worthless as the government's so-called public or even gentleman's agreement. Therefore, although the chairman of the Municipal Council is a very close friend of mine, if he can understand me, I also ask the audience to understand him (the audience laughs), because he has no choice but to do so due to circumstances. Now, please listen to my analysis of this resolution, but before I do so, I ask you to remember what Hamlet said in Shakespeare's play, 'It is, it is,' and Antony's speech on Caesar's body. The language of these two people is very accurate when compared to the present situation. For the past eighteen years, we have suffered from the authorities' poor management. They sat proudly in the taxpayers' meeting, like ancient gladiators, but without their merits. Therefore, we have made a big mistake in electing them as the people to manage us. We have heard the breeze of freedom in the past eighteen years. The achievements they have built have brought us into the stratosphere, as they have increased the Municipal Council's expenditure by 500 percent. In their eyes, this is as insignificant as a mosquito bite, but you may not yet know that they have increased the expenditure on old-age pensions and exchange subsidies by 35,000 percent. However, we should endure the pain we know, as it is better than escaping the pain we do not know. If there is anyone among us who likes the relationship between prehistoric people and pigs, please cut his throat himself, and must cut it from the left ear to the right ear. On the other hand, if anyone likes to be the leader of sheep, he only needs to make a small hole in his throat (the audience laughs). But as far as I know, what is the difference in the result? If corpses are also taxed, then why should we die? The grievances we are suffering are even worse than what Rehoboam said in Chapter 12 of the Books of Kings, as Rehoboam always refused to listen to the advice of the elders and preferred to consult with young people. It is said that Rehoboam said, 'If my father put a yoke on you, I will put another yoke on top of it. If my father punished you with whips, then I will punish you with scorpion whips.' Fellow comrades, what this resolution gives to your corpses (not to you) is worth sixteen Rehoboams! (Laughter) If you are deceived by sweet words, then I ask you to pay attention to what the third clause of the proposal says, that is, the term of office of the directors of the temporary board of directors shall not be less than one year. If the resolution says that it shall not be more than one year, then there is still time to add artificial sweat to the corpse, but now it is stipulated that it shall not be less than one year, then your grave trees have already grown. Although this meeting is not a banquet of Belshazzar, there are no nobles, beauties, wine, and meat. Therefore, I think it is also very suitable to call a meeting at the slaughterhouse, but my eyesight is not bad, because I can still see a hand writing 'Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin' on the wall behind you or on the podium. But if you can reject this proposal, you can stop this hand and the terrible and fatal word 'Peres.'"</p>
<h3>New US Ambassador to China, Gauss's Travel Plans</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, will come to China soon to take up his new post. A reporter from *Ping Ming News* learned from a senior official at the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday that there is no definite report on the new ambassador's travel plans. However, according to his speculation, Gauss and his family will reunite in their hometown and then set off for China, around the end of next month. According to news, the current US Ambassador, Johnson, will return to the United States after the new ambassador arrives in China to report everything to Washington before going to Australia to take up his post. The new and old ambassadors will meet in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>British Royal Air Force Organizes a Sino-British Squadron</h3>
<p>The British government has recently decided to organize a squadron of the British Royal Air Force, named the "Sino-British Squadron." The reason for this decision is that the funds, totaling 100,000 British pounds, were all raised by British people in China. The Royal Air Force squadron was originally named the "Anglo-Chinese Squadron" on January 30 of this year. Now, the British government authorities, in order to respect China, as the funds were donated by British friends and British nationals in China, specially renamed it the "Sino-British Squadron." After the squadron is organized and established, it will be ready to be active in the sky at any time and serve in the front lines.</p>
<h3>Briquettes on the Black Market Rise Again</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the coal market once tended to stabilize, and major coal companies also disposed of their stockpiles separately. The amount of spot goods in the market gradually increased, and the black market price of briquettes once fell from 196 yuan per ton to 186 yuan. Due to the abundance of spot goods in the market, the sales were quite sluggish. Due to the unstable international situation in the Soviet Union, speculators continued to act, insisting on hoarding goods and refusing to supply them to the market, causing anxiety among the people. The black market price of briquettes was raised by about 10 yuan, and it has now recovered to the highest price of a week ago. According to the actual situation, there is no reason for the price of briquettes to continue to rise. It is now known that various coal industry associations are trying to stop it, but it is not known whether they can fulfill their duties.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Arrested a Chinese Man Named Wang in the French Concession, Now Detained in the French Police Station Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou sent military police to the French Police Station at 11:30 AM yesterday, requesting that detectives be dispatched to search No. 6, Huanlong Lane, Huanlong Road, and arrest a man named Wang. The father waited in the house, and they did not withdraw until 12:00 PM. However, the arrested Wang is now detained in the French Police Station awaiting investigation, but the reason for the arrest is unknown. According to another rumor, the Wang was arrested in Hongkou by detectives in early autumn last year and has been held for half a year. Yesterday, the headquarters sent personnel to escort Wang to the French Police Station, requesting that detectives be dispatched to search his residence at No. 6, Huanlong Lane. The results of the search are unknown.</p>
<h3>The Nanshi Area Suddenly Announced a State of Tension Yesterday Morning, Residents Forbidden from Entering the Concession, Rumors of an Escaped Prisoner from the Japanese Military Police, All Iron Gates in the French Concession Were Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>From 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese side in Nanshi suddenly announced a special curfew. Japanese military police squads and Japanese military police officers were deployed at key traffic points along the Mingguo Road, and the situation was extremely tense for a time. All iron gates in the French Concession were temporarily closed as a result, and then immediately opened. During the curfew yesterday morning, Nanshi residents going to the concession were blocked and not allowed to leave the area, while residents going to Nanshi from the concession were not prohibited from entering Nanshi. However, they had to hold a certificate to enter, and they had to enter from Xinqiao Street and Xinkaihe. At 11:00 AM, the Japanese side announced that Nanshi residents could enter the concession from Xinkaihe, but all other places were still prohibited from leaving the area. At noon, traffic was restored. It was later learned that the Japanese side's implementation of the curfew was due to the escape of two prisoners being held by the Japanese military police in Nanshi in the early morning. After the incident, the Japanese side implemented strict vigilance and conducted a major search. It is not possible to ascertain whether the escaped prisoners have been re-arrested.</p>
<p>Reported in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that the Japanese authorities in Nanshi closed the iron gates along the French Concession this morning (the 22nd) without stating the reason. Chinese sources say that a Japanese soldier was shot in Nanshi at 9:00 AM this morning, but the Japanese side denies this. According to them, there were no unusual incidents in Nanshi this morning, and the closure of the iron gates is a common occurrence and has no special significance.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Surcharges in the French Concession Will Increase Significantly, Increase Will Be Implemented Before the End of This Month, Fuel Shortage Forces Severe Measures</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported yesterday (the 21st) that the French-owned water and electricity company in Shanghai, due to rising costs and deteriorating fuel conditions, is about to significantly increase the water and electricity surcharges charged to users in the concession. The implementation date may be before the end of this month. It is heard that the company will soon notify the French Consulate in Shanghai of this intention. It is believed that the electricity surcharge will increase from 103 percent to 125 percent. (This resolution still means the increase is less, as the previous increase was from 97 percent to 103 percent). The electricity surcharge is currently 140 percent and is expected to increase to 190 percent. The electricity surcharge for electric cookers and heaters will also be handled accordingly (the previous increase was from 97 percent to 140 percent).</p>
<p>Electricity Bills Soar, More Than Tripled</p>
<p>The water surcharge will increase from 49 percent to 75 percent. It is noted that a year ago, the electricity (motor) and heating surcharges were both 60 percent, and the water surcharge was 30 percent. In the past twelve months, except for water, electricity surcharges have more than tripled. Although electricity prices in the French Concession have increased, they are still considered low compared to electricity prices in Zhabei and the Public Concession. The most expensive is Zhabei, because residents of Zhabei have to exchange legal tender for military scrip to pay for water and electricity.</p>
<p>Greatest Impact on the Public Concession</p>
<p>Due to the low value of the currency, electricity prices here are still lower than anywhere else in the Far East or the world. The Shanghai Power Company and the French-owned water and electricity company have recently had to take severe measures to limit electricity consumption as much as possible due to fuel shortages. This measure has a greater impact on the Public Concession, as factories located in the Public Concession account for almost 96 percent.</p>
<h3>Weiguang Hospital Offers Free Smoking Cessation, Wang Fen Donates 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wang Fen submitted a letter to this newspaper, saying, "To the esteemed chief editor, twenty years ago, due to illness, I became addicted to smoking and sank into the dark sea, which was unspeakable suffering. I had tried to quit in hospitals in Shanghai and Hankou as many as six times, but all failed due to the unbearable pain during withdrawal, and I gave up halfway without quitting. This time, I came to Shanghai and, through the introduction of a friend, entered Weiguang Hospital in Siming Lane, Avenue Joffre, and stayed for seven days. Without delirium or drowsiness, I was able to detoxify and eliminate my addiction unknowingly. Moreover, I was comfortable and peaceful during the seven days, without any pain. It is truly thanks to the high level of medical skill of Dr. Li that I was able to achieve such good results. Since being discharged from the hospital, I have been refreshed, my appetite has increased sharply, and my health has improved greatly. I am deeply grateful, so I have donated 1,000 yuan in national currency to the hospital so that anyone who is determined to quit smoking but lacks the means can enjoy a free chance to quit. I know that this is a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to meet all needs with my limited resources, but I hope to inspire others and that collective will can build a great wall. Moreover, the government has now promulgated new and strict anti-smoking laws. I urge all blacklisted comrades to get rid of their bad habits as soon as possible, turn back to the shore, and avoid severe punishment in the future. Therefore, I have specifically submitted this letter, requesting your newspaper to publicize and introduce it, so that those who are determined to quit but lack the means can get out of the sea of misery as soon as possible. This is my sincere hope." With respect, Wang Fen, April 21, 1941. (Anyone requesting free smoking cessation can send a letter to this newspaper to be forwarded to Weiguang Hospital).</p>

<h3>Staff of the Commercial Press Demand, The Management Has Not Yet Accepted, The Main and Branch Offices Were Closed Yesterday Afternoon, The Police Authorities Persuade Negotiations Today</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press Staff Association, because the demands it had made were not accepted by the management, convened a general meeting on the evening of the previous day. All staff members attended and resolved to put forward four final conditions to the company: (1) The company is required to maintain the minimum wage rate from April. (2) Refusal to transfer until the life of Shanghai colleagues is safe. (3) Immediately return the arrears after the war. (4) Abolish unreasonable contracts and not dismiss colleagues without reason. The conditions</p>
<p>The Management Firmly Refuses, The Staff's Conditions</p>
<p>Were formally submitted to the company at 9:00 AM yesterday and were firmly rejected by the management, causing the staff to become anxious. A general meeting was convened at 2:00 PM, and a go-slow was started from 3:30 PM. From 5:00 PM, the iron gates were pulled shut, slogans were posted, a strike was implemented, and business was suspended. From the manager down,</p>
<p>All Fast, Expressing Determination</p>
<p>All 600-plus people remained inside, fasting for 48 hours in order to urge the management to thoroughly awaken. The association will not resume work until the measures are announced. It is reported that the association will issue a letter to compatriots, appealing to all sectors for assistance.</p>
<p>Late Yesterday Night, Employees Left the Building</p>
<p>Afterwards, when this reporter went to the building to investigate, dozens of Chinese and Western detectives from the Central Police Station had been dispatched to suppress the strike. The manager, Bao Qinglin, and the head of the personnel section, Shi Jiu-yun, were first protected and escorted out. Afterwards, all 500-plus employees were gathered in the lower-level business department, where the Western police chief patiently persuaded them to engage in sincere negotiations between labor and management today, to support each other, and to cope with the difficult times. It was not until around 11:00 PM that all the employees withdrew and returned to their residences.</p>
<h3>Surcharges on Foreign Rice Rise Steadily, The Rice Market Is Uncontrolled, Market Detectives Arrest Rice Profiteers Who Exceed Limits, Released Due to Lack of Evidence</h3>
<p>The rice market is out of control, and with speculation rampant, the entire rice market is becoming increasingly chaotic. Black market surcharges are rampant. After the market opened yesterday, there was an initial surge in prices, causing panic and rumors. Major players insisted on hoarding goods and refused to supply the market, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the market and surcharges rising steadily. Today, the surcharge for No. 1 tribute rice was fiercely raised to</p>
<p>1,800 yuan, which is 18 yuan beyond the limit per bag. The surcharge for second-class goods also requires 1,400 to 1,500 yuan, which is unexpected. After the rice market opened yesterday, due to the increasingly chaotic market conditions, the authorities' detectives were densely distributed around the market, detecting the illegal activities of rice profiteers. Liu Jingzhi, the representative of Defeng Grain Store, No. 133 Nanjing Road, actually obtained a market entry permit from Wang Yuji Rice Store, No. 518 Jiujiang Road, and mixed into the rice market yesterday morning, attempting to sell 100 bags of Western broken rice beyond the limit. He was discovered by the detectives and immediately arrested and taken to the Central Police Station. After investigation, due to lack of evidence, he was released at 5:00 PM that afternoon. The authorities are urged to investigate and punish rice profiteers strictly to warn others. Also,</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrives in Shanghai continuously and in large quantities. Yesterday, the French company Bernardin &amp; de Porre's ship brought 39,000 bags of foreign rice directly from Saigon. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yuan Sheng Wheel, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and brought 4,904 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In total, three ships brought 70,000 bags of foreign rice yesterday, and a large number of shipments are still on the way. In the past, rice stocks in this city have also been extremely sufficient, so there is no shortage. It is very clear that rice prices should not rise wildly.</p>
<h3>Spitting Habits, Publicity Week to Begin Tomorrow, Spitting Penalties Will Be Formulated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Organizations Joint Association has set the date for the annual Health Campaign Publicity Week from the 24th to the 30th of this month. The main focus of this campaign is to eliminate the bad habit of spitting. In addition to having the cooperation of the authorities in the two concessions to have storytellers in various playgrounds tell public health stories during this week, pictures and slogans will also be posted in the display windows of Yong'an, Xinxin, and other major companies to attract attention from all sectors. However, the association does not plan to have any special publicity activities in schools this year, as it knows that the schools have automatically promoted public health this year and have achieved considerable results, so there is no need for further publicity. However, the general public still does not pay much attention to the bad habit of spitting. It is heard that the Public Works Department is planning to formulate spitting penalties. Before the penalties are implemented, the Women's Organizations Joint Association will conduct this publicity campaign again in order to encourage citizens to automatically abolish the bad habit of spitting everywhere, so as to avoid being subject to mandatory restrictions in the future. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will work hard to promote it from now on.

<h3>Food; Over 70,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in One Day; Stone Rice Still Surging by Six or Seven Yuan; How Heartbreaking! Shanghai's Food for the People; How Delightful! Shanghai's Hoarders</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was even more exuberant, with spot prices surging wildly. The black-hearted profiteers continued to exert their power, and the speculative ball was kicked higher and higher. Those heartless people only care about their own wealth and do not care that most people will starve to death. The rice market has reached this point, and there is no solution. There is a sense of despair. As soon as the market opened in the morning, there were large buyers bidding up the price. With a wave of their magic hands, the market price rose rapidly. The skin ball gang had a way to make money, and the spot prices were raised step by step. No. 1 Saigon early market was 1,300 to 1,400 yuan, mid-market was 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, afternoon market was 1,800 to 1,900 yuan, No. 2 was 1,300 to 1,500 yuan, small grain early was 1,300 to [illegible] yuan, then to 1,600 to 1,700 yuan, Siamese rice was 1,500 yuan to 1,650 yuan, broken rice was also from 1,000 to 1,200 yuan, stone rice also reached nearly 1,000 yuan, and other rice was also jumping and surging, increasing by five, six, or seven yuan compared to the previous market. Although there was no official market in the afternoon, the speculators' greed had not yet waned. Before the evening market, there were rumors that the buyers were not in harmony, and the market began to stabilize. The daily transaction on the market was less than 10,000 bags, but the number of black market transactions that directly changed the names of the households is difficult to estimate. They are all sitting idly by while hoarders commit evil deeds, and the people's food is difficult to obtain. They do not try to save the situation, and even if every grain of rice is like a pearl, they still do not ask or hear about it. How heartbreaking is Shanghai's food for the people, how delightful are Shanghai's hoarders.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice is still arriving in Shanghai. The Hualun Foreign Company's Gelan Wheel directly [illegible] from Saigon with 20,000 [illegible] 313 bags of foreign rice, arrived at the port yesterday morning, and berthed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload.

<p>The price of thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice followed the rice and soared. A chaotic phenomenon is difficult to describe.

Australian flour has been stored until it is exhausted, and the market is quite tight. Kan flour has a lot of new arrivals and is cheaper than Australian flour. There are also new brands that have recently arrived, such as Airplane and Steamship brands, which are even cheaper than other brands.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions are as quiet as ever. Inland arrivals have been interrupted invisibly. On the Chinese factory side, the demand for raw materials is not urgent for purchases.

<h3>Sugar Speculation Intensifies; Market Temporarily Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was quite enthusiastic for speculation. The highest and lowest difference reached ten yuan. Seeing this situation, the giants in the industry feared that it would cause other changes, so they announced the suspension of the market at 10:00 AM after the market opened in the morning, hoping to have a proper solution to handle the aftermath. The association fixed the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar at 102 yuan, which then rose to 105 yuan, 7 yuan.

Defu, Xinfengyong, and retail investors strongly supported the price, raising it to 6,750 yuan. Securities firm Yida sold, and Chengji also sold. Upon hearing that the US dollar could be settled at 5.1875 this month, the price immediately fell by 60 yuan, to within 6,700 yuan, and further to 6,690 yuan. Meiyuan, Tongkangyong, Defu, Hengji, Tianyuan, Yongcheng, and Gonghe all entered the market. Around 10 o'clock, the exchange rate suddenly tightened, and the price soared. Upon hearing that HSBC's initial listing was reduced, the price rose to 6,770 yuan around 10:30 AM. Dafeng and Xinfengyong sold to profit, and Chengji continued to sell. Tongkangyong resold, and the price retreated to 6,738 yuan. After that, it stabilized. At noon closing, it was 6,740 yuan. After the closing, Yiren and Hesheng bought, and in an instant, it rose to 6,770 yuan, then around 6,760 yuan. At 2:00 PM, the market opened at 6,770 yuan, 30 yuan higher than the noon closing price. Later, seeing securities firms and silver firms forcefully squeezing the market, it was reduced to 6,755 yuan. Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and draft dealers absorbed the supply, raising it to 6,768 yuan. Nearing 3:00 PM, bearish rumors suddenly arose, and the US dollar hardened again. The market momentum was very weak. Hengji shorted up to 4,000 taels. Defu, Xianghe, Yida, Yuxingyong, Gonghe, and others scrambled to sell. Many retail investors liquidated, and the price subsequently fell, dropping by 78 yuan, and once saw a low price of 6,690 yuan. Chengji strongly supported the price, and retail investors raised it to 6,705 yuan at 4:00 PM closing, 25 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Based on the settlement price of 5.15625 for the May US dollar, it was 6,754 yuan, a difference of 49 yuan. After closing, it was 6,715 yuan. The high and low range for the day was 80 yuan. The spot price of the official brand gold was 160 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Slightly Decreased by Five Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing was reduced by a slight 5 yuan at 9:30 AM, to 705 yuan. At 10:30 AM, it returned to 710 yuan. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, it was reduced by a slight 5 yuan, to 705 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Erratic Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot prices rise and then fall. The British and US gold pounds also rose first and then fell, ultimately closing one yuan lower than the previous day. British gold bills tended to be stable, and the market price remained flat. US dollar bills fluctuated erratically, with the highest price at 19 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen, and the lowest at 18 yuan 9 jiao. The closing price was 18 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen, which was 1 jiao 9 fen lower than the previous day. Hong Kong bills were also slightly weak. There was still a strong demand for Japanese gold bills, and the market price continued to rise, reaching a high of 2 yuan 1 jiao in the evening market. There was a balanced supply and demand for Korean bills, and the market price remained flat, at 1 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Speculation Continues, Bullish Momentum Remains Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market rebounded and the rising trend looks promising. This is due to rising spot gold prices and the tightening of foreign exchange rates, leading to positive sentiment and triggering buying activity. The market once reached a high price. However, the ongoing war in eastern Zhejiang led some profitable investors to sell, and the market became more relaxed. Nevertheless, demand from Hong Kong firms remained strong, and the rising gold price further strengthened the bullish momentum. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,522 yuan, and the low price was 1,508 yuan. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was 1,516-1,517 yuan, and the closing price was 1,486 yuan. Today, 3,665 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Shuangma yarn opened with continued strong momentum from the previous evening. The initial price was 1,515 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,522 yuan. However, profit-taking caused the market to loosen again, falling to 1,512 yuan. Subsequently, news of rising spot gold prices caused speculative buying activity to surge, and the price rebounded to 1,521 yuan. However, some sold due to the intense warfare, and the price fell back to 1,508 yuan. The closing price rose slightly to 1,513 yuan. It is found that the total volume of transactions in half a day was 7,800 bales. The breakdown of purchases by each firm is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,000; Peers 6,800; Total 7,800</p>
<h3>Quiet Cotton Market, 2,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market has returned to a quiet state. Transaction volume is not as active as before, but inventory is not high, and sentiment among dealers remains positive. Holders are still unwilling to sell, leading to a mediocre market condition. The current spot cotton market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Indian Langzhen 36.5, Junchang 100 bales, Huozhaocao 198.25, Tongyu 200 bales</p>
<p>Indian cotton continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Hunan vessel previously transported over 800 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which has been reported. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng vessel transported 2,000 bales of cotton from Kolkata. (Year)</p>
<p>Another news report on foreign cotton trading in Shanghai's foreign firms: On one hand, the unsettled situation and fluctuating yarn market have led to a slightly subdued sentiment. On the other hand, continuous arrivals in recent days have resulted in significant purchases by various parties, slightly suppressing their enthusiasm. However, the market condition remains stable. A small number of dealers and factories are making sporadic purchases, so the future is optimistic, and the cotton market is still expected to develop actively.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell initially due to selling by foreign merchants, but rebounded afterward due to purchases by dealers and New Orleans futures, resulting in a closing price that was higher by 2 to 5 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell initially due to selling by cotton merchants and retail investors, and the liquidation of positions by various large firms. However, it rebounded slightly afterward due to the situation favoring bulls. The closing price was down by about three rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be bullish by one rupee.</p>
<h3>Minor Price Increases in Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market saw a slight rebound yesterday, with a firm trend, due to the continued increase in production costs at the factories. Demand for spot sales from local and Guangdong/Nanyang firms remained strong. However, sales channels in Zhejiang and Fujian were temporarily disrupted. Coarse twill cloth rose by 5 jiao, and coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Prices for fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached/dyed cloth remained flat. The Muchang Street market traded 500-plus pieces of various cloth types. Guangdong and Hong Kong firms purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth and twill goods. Nanyang firms purchased bleached cloth, and Hong Kong firms purchased colored cloth and colored khaki in over 5,000 bolts. Today, 2,330 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Hong Kong, 155 pieces to Singapore, and 50 pieces to Rangoon.</p>
<p>Dongbu: Longtou fine cloth opened at 51.75 jiao in the morning and closed at 51.55 jiao at noon. Due to sluggish spot sales in the afternoon, selling offers continued to soften, and the price fell to 51.25 jiao at closing. Sijunzi serge opened at 1 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen in the morning and closed at 1 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 2.5 li in the evening.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Pangolin Scales' Price Soars by Hundreds</h3>
<p>Pangolin scales are in short supply due to a lack of arrivals and inventory, leading to a significant increase in market prices. Recent arrivals of a few pieces by suppliers saw prices soar by as much as 100 yuan, an unprecedented record. Suppliers' selling prices also increased accordingly.</p>

<h3>A Meal</h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>A letter came from the countryside, reporting a long description of the famine disaster, ending with a request that fellow villagers in Shanghai think of a solution. Speaking of relatives, my aunt's husband is currently the most successful, and the letter naturally mentioned him, so I set off for my aunt's house in the drizzling rain.</p>
<p>My uncle was busy with official matters and not at home, so I talked to my aunt about eating bran, starving to death, and asking for relief. My aunt is illiterate, so she wouldn't understand if I told her in general terms. Therefore, I had to use all my verbal skills to meticulously describe the disaster; however, my aunt's family is doing well, and hearing me repeatedly talk about starvation and eating bran, she became somewhat unhappy. On the other hand, the Shaoxing maid listened with her mouth agape, looking quite distressed. Following the same steps as the letter from the village, I first recounted a long series of hardships and tragedies, and finally, I asked my aunt to think of a solution. Of course, thinking of a solution meant my aunt had to use her wealth-making hand, but my aunt frowned, as if she was annoyed that I was so verbose. She retorted, "Aren't your whole family in Shanghai? For other families, I think you should talk to your uncle about it."</p>
<p>In reality, if my family were also in the countryside, my aunt wouldn't necessarily be generous.</p>
<p>The maid came to announce that dinner was ready. Good, rice is expensive, and my nephew, the emperor, is going to freeload off his aunt today.</p>
<p>I walked into the dining room and sat down at the table. Only three people were sitting at the table. If you exclude me, then only my aunt and cousin are eating. Heaven is truly teasing people, as someone like my aunt happens to have only two people eating.</p>
<p>I don't know if my aunt was being polite or sincere, but she said, "Yi Hui, eat up, don't be polite at your aunt's house."</p>
<p>So, I didn't stand on ceremony and habitually picked up my rice bowl. After taking only a few bites, suddenly, with a "squeak," the silence around the dining table was shattered. The sound was so loud and sharp that I was startled, and my eyes involuntarily shot towards my cousin, who resembled Xi Shi, sitting across from me. It was truly unbelievable that my sickly cousin could make such a robust sound. Examining her face, I saw her eyebrows were furrowed in anger, and her gaze was fiercely directed at the maid. The maid stared blankly, just as clueless as I was. After a long while, she asked softly, "Miss, what is it?"</p>
<p>"What?" My cousin quickly pushed the half-eaten bowl of white rice across the table.</p>
<p>My aunt and the maid's eyes were simultaneously drawn to the bowl of rice. After a moment, my aunt said, "Cui Ying, take that bowl of rice and throw it away."</p>
<p>So, the maid, Cui Ying, slowly lowered her eyelids with a dejected look and took the bowl of rice out of the dining room, while I remained completely in the dark.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Cui Ying returned with an empty bowl. The rice pot was on a small table nearby. I saw Cui Ying preparing to serve rice for the young lady again.</p>
<p>My cousin's anger hadn't subsided. When Cui Ying handed her the bowl of rice, she said, "Go get me another empty bowl!"</p>
<p>Cui Ying ran to the kitchen and brought back an empty bowl. My cousin is a rare commodity; I don't know what she wants an empty bowl for. While stuffing my second bowl of rice into my mouth, I secretly watched what tricks my cousin was going to conjure up in that empty bowl.</p>
<p>My cousin used her ivory chopsticks, with her orchid fingers gracefully poised, she counted the rice grains, transferring them one by one from the full bowl to the empty bowl. As she counted, she suddenly lashed out at Cui Ying, "Don't you know anything? What do you do all day?"</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, my second bowl of rice was gone. As soon as I stood up, my aunt hurriedly called out, "Cui Ying, serve rice, serve rice." So, I temporarily relieved Cui Ying from her embarrassment.</p>
<p>But after serving the rice, Cui Ying was still called over by my cousin. "Look! The last bowl was full of rat droppings, and this one is full of pebbles. Did you even wash the rice? If I eat the pebbles, I'll get appendicitis. Who will be responsible? Rat droppings are the most unhygienic. It's disgusting! This bowl of rice is fit for you to eat!"</p>
<p>At that moment, my aunt pushed back her chair.</p>
<p>I asked, "Aunt, are you finished eating?"</p>
<p>"Well, my appetite isn't very good. Eating one and a half bowls is already more than usual."</p>
<p>After my aunt finished eating, my cousin also stood up and said, "I can't eat anymore either. Thinking about the rat droppings makes me want to throw up yesterday's meal!"</p>
<p>But I was different: Firstly, I was a guest, and if I didn't eat a few more bowls of rice, my aunt might think I disliked their dishes; secondly, my stomach was bigger than theirs, and I had just said a lot of things, which emptied my stomach. My cousin not only didn't talk but also sat on the sofa eating cakes and biscuits... so I originally wanted to eat four bowls, but since my aunt and cousin were both finished, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to stubbornly stay at the table alone. So, I sped up my pace and ate my third bowl and called it quits.</p>
<p>After the meal, I persistently talked to my aunt about eating bran and starving to death, hoping to persuade her to use her wealth-making hand, but my aunt pressed her money bag tighter and tighter. In the end, I concluded that I was powerless. So, I left, preparing to find my uncle and see if he had any solutions.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Drawn on His Face</p>
<p>His sudden resistance surprised Ji Zhaoxiong, but he himself couldn't soften as a result.</p>
<p>"Alright, Boss Wu, your affairs are in my hands. Don't regret it later!" Thinking this, he turned around, pretending to leave immediately, but hoping that Qiu Haitang would perhaps figure it out himself and immediately reach out to stop him.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to regret!" Unexpectedly, Qiu Haitang was determined not to give him any face, his tone just as firm to the end. Thus, Ji Zhaoxiong couldn't back down and had to harden his heart and walk out without looking back.</p>
<p>With him gone, Qiu Haitang naturally lost the desire to read the newspaper. He really wished he could go inside immediately to discuss it with Xiang Qi; however, Yuan Baofan was here, how could he possibly talk to Xiang Qi? But the situation was clearly very tense, and if he didn't take precautions, Ji Zhaoxiong might resort to dirty tricks, and it would be too late to avoid the consequences.</p>
<p>"I should talk to Yu Kun first!" He hastily put on a white Indian silk robe and quickly slipped out of the Yuan's house without even taking a straw hat.</p>
<p>Since the birth of Xiang Qi's daughter, Yu Kun, relying on his own cleverness and Qiu Haitang's money, secretly bought a newborn boy and switched him for the girl; he also handled everything about finding a house and hiring a wet nurse. From then on, he continued to use the stage name "Grasshopper," performing in Tianjin for long periods. In the past two or three years, he secretly helped Qiu Haitang and Luo Xiang Qi countless times. The fact that Ji Zhaoxiong couldn't find their secret hideout was largely due to Zhao Yu Kun's involvement.</p>
<p>Up until now, he himself was still single, living year-round in a small public house in the French Concession, leading a very eccentric life: besides a narrow wooden bed that wasn't even three feet wide and a chest of clothes with four broken corners, the room was completely empty. (88)</p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>The world encompasses everything, but its divisions are very clear: yes or no.</p>
<p>Of course, yes is yes; when no, then no, that is also natural. If yes is treated as no, or no is treated as yes, it is contrary behavior.</p>
<p>To listen to nature is to ignore it; to sigh at what is not natural is to form passive criticism; to complain that it is futile leads to discouragement; to resent that it is not natural can only be left to fate!</p>
<p>To know that it is so, but not know why it is so, is foolish; to know that it is so, and also know why it is so... even the clever are not only that.</p>
<p>To be a model for the masses, to be a true sage, one must act naturally and righteously, for truth does not allow for going against the grain!</p>
<p>To be able to transform the natural, to create the constant, and to conform to the inevitable, that is the natural! There is no need for anything else.</p>
<h3>My Wife is a "New Woman"</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>It's been two months since the wedding, time to write down some impressions of "her."</p>
<p>Of course, she is a modern woman. No, she says the word "modern" has a derogatory meaning, and she should be called a woman of the new era. "New Era," what a beautiful term! Oily, electric-waved hair, face covered in Three Flowers face powder, fingernails with crimson henna, "to-to" sound of leather shoes, and, and, finding a name really took some time!</p>
<p>The first day after the wedding, she asked me how much profit my company made. I told her the truth. "Oh! Is it that little?" She stared at me in surprise, "Then how will we maintain our life?" This question left me speechless. She had to cheerfully look at herself in the mirror and evenly apply her rouge.</p>
<p>If someone thinks that we still maintain silence between us because of unfamiliarity, that is a misunderstanding. Once, when I asked her to wash my handkerchief, she bluntly said: "Do you treat me like a slave? Do you still think this is the feudal era? Women are not the private property of men anymore. This is the civilized era, men and women are equally free and equal, you know?"</p>
<p>Her "justified" answer left me dumbfounded; I was wrong, I shouldn't use the rights of a "husband" to oppress a "new woman"; I restricted her freedom, I overturned mutual equality. "This is the civilized era, and old traditions are outdated. Women shouldn't serve men, just as men don't serve women."</p>
<p>I was wrong, I even begged her forgiveness as if carrying thorns on my back. However, under the "new" shroud, what am I worth? I only have the qualification to "not speak," I only have to silently suffer the consequences of my own actions. She sneered: "You don't like watching movies, you can't play cards, dance, smoke, or entertain guests, you can't do anything, you're not fit to live in this era, you're not a person who goes to big events!"</p>
<p>"Am I not living in the 20th century?" I shifted my gaze to books and pondered with my eyes closed. "I am definitely not outdated, I am not a residue of old-fashioned thinking, precisely because I have received seventeen years of modern education."</p>
<p>I also became confident. Because I have been influenced by the new era and nurtured by civilization, I am somewhat more knowledgeable than her. I am no longer distressed because I have also developed a contemptuous attitude towards her superficial understanding of the "new woman."</p>
<p>I must fight, I must correct her understanding.</p>
<p>I will use all my strength to give my wife another model of a "new woman."</p>

<h3>Discussing the Adaptation of "Crossroads"</h3>
<p>— Sha Wei</p>
<p>A Visit with "Second Monster" Lu Si</p>
<p>It is well known that the film "Crossroads" is being adapted into a stage play by the Tianfeng Drama Troupe. In order to learn the details of the adaptation, I visited Mr. Lu Si Te, the adapter of the play, the next day. Upon meeting him, I couldn't help but laugh. Why? Well, his hair was so long it looked like it hadn't been cut for four months. If it weren't daytime, people who didn't know him might have thought Song Danping from "Midnight Song" had been resurrected! Monster! Monster! The "Second Monster" after Shen Siling, his reputation is well deserved. After exchanging pleasantries, I formally raised the question.</p>
<p>Reporter: I heard that "Crossroads" has been completely finished. Can you tell me some details about the adaptation?</p>
<p>Lu Si: Before I started the adaptation, the entire play in my mind's stage was originally divided into three acts; however, when I officially started writing, I felt difficulties because the film "Crossroads" left me with too much material. Three acts simply couldn't accommodate it, so now it has been changed to four acts. The first act introduces the characters of the whole play, writing about the bitterness of youth unemployment; the second act narrates Lao Zhao's hard work after getting a job, and the big quarrel between the front and back buildings caused by An's revenge on the landlady, and his unexpected romantic encounters; the third act tells about Lao Zhao and Yang Zhiying's coincidental encounter in the park, and also narrates the reasons for Big Brother Liu's departure from Shanghai and the factory's bankruptcy; the fourth act writes about Lao Zhao's "getting love" and "losing his job," and finally learns a lesson from reality and gains understanding from his actions.</p>
<p>Reporter: Is the adapted stage script completely faithful to Xi Ling's film legacy?</p>
<p>Lu Si: The main thing is to be faithful to the original. However, this is common sense: film, under the control of the director's will, captures individual fragments, which are then edited and compiled to establish a kind of film time and space, but there is a great difference between this and real time and space. And the use of this cinematic technique of focusing on time and space is not possible on the stage. Therefore, the adapted stage script differs slightly from the original in these places (time and place). In addition, I wanted to make "Crossroads" more effective here and now, so I changed the era in which the play takes place and moved it to the present day after the war. In this way, the reasons for the factory's bankruptcy and Lao Zhao's unemployment, etc., must of course be given a different explanation from the original.</p>
<p>Reporter: Can I know your self-criticism of the adapted version of the play?</p>
<p>Lu Si: In a word: "Very bad"! — Please give a lot of guidance during the performance!</p>
<p>Reporter: You're too kind. Then will you participate in the rehearsals?</p>
<p>Lu Si: No. I have absolute trust in the director of this play, Mr. Wu Chen, who has a very deep study and understanding of drama.</p>
<p>Talking about this, I bid farewell and came out.</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>After Gou Huisheng's performance on the New Stage, Zhang Yipeng is taking a temporary break. Yesterday, the reporter visited him. Recently, because his father, Zhang Yingjie (i.e., Gai Jiaotian), is seriously ill, and his beloved wife, Han Suqiu, is also unwell and has not fully recovered, he is not in a good mood; however, his daily practice, vocal exercises, and playwriting work are still not interrupted.</p>
<p>According to him, he plans to adapt the play "Iron Rooster," renaming it "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." He wants to write Zhang Jiaxiang as a character completely different from the characters he currently plays. His surrender to the Xiang commander is completely fake. He tries to assassinate him several times, but is unable to get close. Later, Chen Xiangrui discovers his actions and allows him to be executed. This is a rough outline of the whole play. After he adapts it, he feels that it will be more meaningful.</p>
<p>Ma Junnan Kun, a famous amateur opera singer in Shanghai, is the eldest son of Mr. Ma Jinqing, a giant in the jewelry industry. He was taught by the famous teacher Liu Bilin and is skilled in many operas. He is usually enthusiastic about charitable causes. Last night, he performed "Lianhuan Tao" at the Golden Theater to raise funds for the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, with his teacher Liu Bilin playing the qin for him.</p>
<h3>James Roosevelt's Path into Film</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>James Roosevelt, the eldest son of the American White House owner Roosevelt, now lives in Hollywood and is also a film worker. But recently, news came that he was following his father's wishes for a trip to China. Therefore, I will write about James Roosevelt's path into film.</p>
<p>Early Childhood</p>
<p>James is Roosevelt's eldest son, serious and hardworking except during rest. From an early age, he inherited his father's upbringing. If he likes political life, he will definitely have considerable achievements in the future. At the age of twenty, he looks very experienced, and some people think he is more than that age. His thinking is rich and correct. He has a talent for speaking, and on the radio, he is often mistaken for his father.</p>
<p>Abandoning Politics for Film</p>
<p>James Roosevelt has always had a good impression of the film industry. Since the year before last, he has abandoned political life and concentrated on the film industry in Hollywood. It's strange that he is unwilling to take on military duties in the government but likes to be an executive in a film company. Since joining United Artists, he has concentrated his lifelong energy on the film industry. Therefore, in the past three years, he has made considerable contributions to the Hollywood film industry.</p>
<p>Announcing Engagement</p>
<p>Recently, news came that James Roosevelt and Ms. Romance Chet announced their engagement on April 15. Ms. Chet is a female caregiver. After a considerable period of friendship, they officially got engaged and obtained a marriage license from the authorities in advance. It is noted that James officially divorced his ex-wife, Miss Betsy Cushing, on March 7, 1940, and only found his current lover after being a widower for a year.</p>
<p>Departing for China</p>
<p>After his engagement, James Roosevelt left San Francisco on April 19, taking a clipper ship east to the wartime capital of Chongqing, with a slight delay in Cairo along the way. The only purpose of Mr. Luo's trip to China is to carry on his father's wishes and promote Sino-American relations. After arriving in Chongqing, in addition to some important matters to discuss with the Chinese authorities, he will also go to various places in the interior to visit battle sites and observe the progress of wartime construction in China. Another piece of news said that after Mr. Luo, there will be several other people from the United States coming to China to conduct investigations.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Film City</h3>
<p>— Bertha</p>
<p>"The Philadelphia Story" is Zhen Shanlin Hepburn's first work returning to the film industry. According to general reviews, the film can be listed as one of the best comedies of the year, because not only is Catherine's performance excellent, but James Stewart and Cary Grant are also successful. Now, Catherine has become the goal of all film companies, and they all want to sign contracts with her, but her intention is to return to the Broadway stage at least one more time.</p>
<p>Milan Lona has been very close to Lin Daini'er recently, and they may get engaged before this summer.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Shuo Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Attacking Cities and Killing Generals in a Chaotic Battle</p>
<p>Li Xinyang brandished his knife and cursed at the magistrate of Qi County, "I have no grudges against you, and I kindly helped you defend the city. Unfortunately, I failed, and I wanted to escape and return home to be a good citizen. You, however, listened to the words of villains, slandered me arbitrarily, and wanted to put me to death as quickly as possible. Your cruelty is extreme. Who knew that my life should not end, and you would have a day to be caught in my grasp? Where do you think you can escape to?" The magistrate of Qi County could only beg for mercy, "Lord Li, please spare me. Take the gold and silver in my cabinet to atone for my sins." The beloved concubine also begged Hong Niangzi bitterly. Li Xin laughed loudly and said, "Dog official, I knew you were accustomed to abuse your power and scrape the people's fat, accumulating a lot of sinful money. The people of Qi County have suffered deeply! Do you want to use this gold and silver to atone for your sins today? It's useless! Not only will you lose everything you own, but you will also lose your life, so that all greedy officials in the world will know what to be warned of." Li Xin spoke eloquently, but Hong Niangzi became impatient waiting by the side, so she said to Li Xin, "Hurry up and do it! We still have to go out of the city to meet my brother. The country is being ruined by these greedy villains. Do they even deserve to be taught a lesson?" Li Xin smiled and said, "That's right." With a wave of the knife in his hand, there was only a snap, and a bloody human head rolled aside. The corpse of the magistrate of Qi County fell to the ground, and he could no longer care about his beloved concubine or gold. The beloved concubine saw Li Xin kill someone and was so frightened that she screamed for help. Hong Niangzi sneered and said, "You slut, I'll send you to be with him." She thrust her sword straight into her heart, and blood splattered everywhere, and she also fell to the ground and died. The jewelry box in her hand fell to the ground with a thud. Hong Niangzi opened the box and saw that it was full of bright pearls and gems, and she laughed, "Let me take it back. Consider it a reward for coming to Qi County again." Li Xin pointed the knife at the gold and silver in the cabinet and said to Hong Niangzi, "What should we do with this dirty money?" Hong Niangzi said, "These are all ill-gotten gains. We might as well have the boys move it back to the mountain to reward them." At this time, several of the boys from Qing Shishan were following the killings, so Hong Niangzi ordered that all the gold and silver in the cabinet be transported back to the Qing Shishan area.</p>
