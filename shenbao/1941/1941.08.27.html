<h3>英美宣言如不獲實現　中國誓必奮戰到底　孔副院長深信美必能主持正義　美日談判將以九國公約為基礎</h3>
<p>合衆社二十穴日重慶電　行政院副院長孔祥熙博士昨日批許邱吉爾氏之談話稱、中國聞悉美日談判、絕不感到疑懼、孔氏云、「余曾歡迎雜邱之八原則程序、現時復樂聞邱吉爾氏之文吿、就中國之立塲言之、余敢信任何美日之談判、均將以九國公的及八原則程序為根據、是以中國殊不必對談判結果有所惶惑、」氏又言、渠敢信「友邦決不至出賣中國、余相信彼等將主持公道、並顧及全世界各國之民族權利、」孔氏解釋稱、九國公的之製定、非特以中國及太平洋之利益為歸依、且實顧及全世界、九國公的及羅邱宜言之各原則、及以全世界之和平及秩序為根據、孔氏宣稱、「余深知羅斯福總統必明瞭如此項原則被忽視及蔑視、則將致引起危險及混亂、而必致發生戰爭、余知羅斯福總統必堅持日本承認此項原則、以為獲致任何解決之根據、」云、孔氏表示相信如日本不，從、則無和平解決之可能、孔氏又言、「吾人已依附此項原則、並將為此項原則而作戰到底、吾人已作戰四年、而為使此項原則實現、在必要時將再戰四年或四十年」孔氏又言、渠感覺羅斯福邱吉爾之八項原則、已使世界之將來有良好之預兆、而邱吉爾之演說更將局勢闡明、而表示英國將全力與美國合作到底、</p>
<p>華盛頓二十五日電　赫爾國務卿今日接見記者時、有人詢以英相表示美國竭盡努力、對日求取成立協議云云、究何所指、赫氏當承認彼曾與日大使野村進行若干决非正式談話、惟並未成立協議、國務卿堅認任何遠東問題之解決、必須以一九三七年七月彼本人所宣佈之十叫點為根據、另據消息靈通者談、美日在華府進行談話、乃無可疑之事、惟赫氏曾明吿野村稱、日本如繼續侵略、則美國不願對日妥協、並將進一步對日施行經濟壓力、赫氏拒絕宜佈日本是吾曾提出解決美日問題之大綱、或美駐日大使格魯是吾曾接到日方之提議、各方人士對於美國是吾願與日維持現狀、由日本暫時進佔越南、以待戰後再討論整個遠東問題、抑或美國郎將對日決裂一節、亦紛加揣測、邱吉爾保證於美日戰爭時盡力助美一語、乃英國有史以來第一决對美國因遠東政策提出如此澈底之義務保證、有資格之觀察家咸認日本之溫和派仍不能改變日政府之侵略政策、而日方之嗜戰者仍不肯放棄其南進、</p>
<p>國際社二十六日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾今日警告日本、反對其作進一步之侵略時宣稱、非至日本停止其武裝征服之舉、美對太平洋各問題、決不能妥協云、赫氏謂、美國在中日戰爭爆發時所宣佈之八點、現仍爲美國之鵠的、氏乃列舉要求採用談判方式、禁用武力之八原則中細目、赫爾力言、美堅持其遠東權利必須保留、並謂美日現正進行非正式之談判、惟華府方面指稱、根據九國公的中之各條例及門戶開放政策、若有關係之列强亦參加談判、則美日目下之爭端、不難可以和平解決云、</p>
<p>國際社二十穴日華盛頓電　星期六國務卿赫爾與日大使野村談話、據透露美日仍各堅持其政策、故國務院以為遠東局勢極為脆弱、聞野村要求美國中止援助重慶、日願與美迅速解決關於遠東之一切問題以為交換、赫爾則向野村指稱、日本若仍係軸心一員、且堅持其「新秩序政策」志在由武力以支配西太平洋、則美實難於對日有何讓步、而亦勢有所不能、惟傳赫爾又曾告野村、若日本採取友好態度、且願以和平方法達其目的、則美國完全願與日本談判遠東一切問題、</p>

<p>路透社二十六日東京電「國民新聞」稱、英相邱吉爾之廣播詞、旨在使泰國疏離日本、邱吉爾且時代錯誤、蓋中日衝突發生於歐戰以前、故日本並非模仿希特勒也、中國之建設乃合作的、越南之進兵乃維希自願的、以壓力施於南亞者、唯英國耳云、官塲對於邱吉爾所暗示之日美基礎談判事、謂毫無所聞、近來未曾接到駐美野村大使之報吿、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>推想理想與幻想</h3>
<p>英首相邱吉爾前天的演說，已正式宣佈美國與日本正進行着關於遠東局勢的重要談判。我們若僅就這一篇演辭來尋繹，對於美·日談判的具體範圍和目標，却還得不到一個比較明確的槪念。但就一般說來，當然不外三種可能：（一）澈底迫日本接受民治國對世界未來局面的見解，這裏包合取消束亞新秩序，退出軸心同盟，及遵守九國公的對中國領土主權的規定。這是最根本的解決辦法。（二）爲適應當前形勢的迫切需要，英·美在三國同盟問題上，使日本提供不響應德·義對英·蘇戰爭的保證，在日本向外擴張間題上，則逼牠作不再繼續南進或北進的諾言。（三）再不然，就是爲减少彼此間的磨擦，而開始解決各種懸案的談判，如撤退僑民，凍結資金，等等。照邱吉爾所用異常鄭重的語氣來看，似乎這决談判的範圍，絕不止於懸案的解決，而美國務卿赫爾的談話，也明示涉及目標的廣大。但照中·美·蘇對邱吉爾演說的反響來看，却又不像就有澈底先解決束方侵略勢力的策動。因爲以目前形勢而論，如欲根本解決東方事件，勢非訴諸武力不可；最低限度，亦須由英·美·蘇等國，分別大規模武力示威，而中國本身的大舉反攻，尤其是最緊要的先決條件之一。總之，在中·美·英·蘇等國沒有以大規模的軍事行動及外交的策應配合發動前，任何一國或兩國的單純外交運用，似乎絕不能迫使日本就範。所以比較起來，上述可能的推測，自以第二種較爲近似。不過這决美·日談判的內容，畢竟是一個具體事件，在沒有揭曉之前，我們祗有以莫大的注意和關心，等候着未來事實的解答。牠的內容如何，當然要決定牠的結果，並進而予遠東甚至全世界整個局勢以非常重大的影響。</p>
<p>在演說中，邱吉爾又再一决地特別强調英·美對於世界當前危機的一致覺悟，而且下了最大決心，不顧一切，向澈底擊敗東西侵略勢力及建造新世界理想之途邁進。誠然！我們祇耍把這兩三個月來歐·亞兩洲所發生的種種，綜合起來一看，則不問在時間上，在空間上，都令人發生非常震驚的感覺。正義力量這决轉危爲安，其間的機運，眞正是間不容髮！假定美國有一絲一毫的苟安念頭，不在今年春初通過「租借法案」，及毅然宣佈澈底擊敗德·義·日的泱心，蘇聯有一絲一毫徼倖旁觀的意思，不在德·義要求假道進攻近東時，堅强予以拒絕，那末，今天世界的局勢如何，固然是誰也不敢說。即使英國方面，當赫斯飛英時，如果不及早迎頭堵住德國和平攻勢的話，那末·現在反侵略陣綫的能吾形成，也就成了一個很大的疑問。所以，反侵略陣綫的結成，今年上半年已經到了實現的最後時間限度。而在空間方面，歐洲侵略暴力，所尙沒有突破的，不過僅剩了蘇聯烏克蘭和土耳其這一角的陸上地帶。假定德·義今春可以通過這一地帶。伸入近東的話，那末，毫無疑義的，牠一定可以一直達到印度，和埋伏在東方的暴力實行携手，使黑暗勢力籠罩了整個的歐亞大陸。東西兩組暴力的分別被擊潰，必須在泰國之東和近東之西，也是非常明顯的。所以，以先後一致覺出時間緊促與空間逼窄，而毅然對東西暴力形成對抗陣錢的中·美·英·蘇等國，今天及未來當然絕不會有絲毫開倒車及自撤藩籬的舉動。像這兩天綏靖主義復活的謠傳，當然是無根的。</p>
<p>其實深一層看，東西兩暴力今天所時時幻想盼望出現的，並不止於綏靖主義的復活這一端。也正如邱吉爾氏所說，那其中的秘訣，就在於進行各個擊破。比如以西方侵略者來說，牠幻想英·美長此坐視，俾以全力攻蘇，又幻想以和平攻勢分化英美內部，甚至連佔取烏克蘭後，突然覓取與蘇聯妥協，轉而全力進攻英帝國的幻想，好像也還沒有放棄，東方的暴力呢，對英·美，則幻想以威脅姿態逼出綏靖主義，以北進口號交換封鎖滇緬交通及停止接濟中國，對蘇聯，則夢想以暫不響應德·義爲口實，交換紅軍的自遠東後撒及停止援助中國。凡此種種，本來早已在中·美·英·蘇等國當局多决的堅決表示和措施前面，完全碰得粉碎了，今而後，已經不値一提。所有正義力量今後的工作，就在於加緊本身方面的合作，加速擊潰侵略者，並通力建造未來新世界。所有東西暴力的陰謀，幻想和謠言，不過表示牠們愈加日暮途窮而已。</p>

<p>路透社廿六日倫敦電　德官方通訊社載英軍由伊拉克三路進兵伊朗、此路係以賴伐杜斯及賴雅特（摩蘇爾東北百哩）爲起點、目的在會台蘇軍於阿柴巴金、中路現由喀尼金向喀斯里許林（報達東北百哩）推進、南路活動區域則在彭達沙巴附近波斯海灣區域及阿巴丹油區、蘇軍之前進係向阿狄比爾（裹海西岸二十五哩）及泰白里齊、</p>

<p>路透社二十六日安加拉電　英美兩國、雖以關於伊朗之一切發展充分通知土耳其但軍隊越境之消息、仍引起相當　奇、因不料如此之速也、目前尙無土官方之反響可見、惟一般人皆信戰事如果發生、土耳其將宣布仍守中立、土國人民對於英國行動、雖不關懷、而對於蘇聯之行動、則不能謂爲歡迎，惟蘇聯將儘早撤兵之宣言、確已使可能之小安大見緩和，</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社廿五日斯丹埠電　此間一般人預料、土耳其對於伊朗戰事、即當宣佈中立、關於此事、莫斯科無綫電台本日曾發表一九二一年蘇伊定第六條秘密條款、規定蘇聯得於必要時佔領伊朗領土、土伊兩國所訂薩達巴條的、與之實相抵觸、土耳其因可不受該的束縛、</p>

<p>英蘇佔領波斯灣　美政界極為重視</p>
<p>合衆社二十六日華盛頓電昨日政界方面宣稱、若英蘇在伊朗爲供給蘇聯之一路綫、則美國將於蘇聯防禦方面爲一重要角色、此方面又稱、伊朗爲最便利最佳之路綫、以運輸供給品至蘇聯、以維將蘇聯抵抗力量、允其在伊朗之北之巴庫油地、又稱、美國艦隊、無疑的將對此工作、爲一歷史性角色、因美國將保護其波斯灣上之供給錢、同時並繼續其太平洋之保護責任、又稱、伊朗爲一最好而可能之結果、以觀美國如何能同時援助英國及蘇聯、而不必由太平洋撤退其艦隊、觀察家對此以爲邱吉爾曾允若一旦與日本發生戰事、英國將以武力援助美國、此說即表明保護經太平洋之美國供給船隻、邱吉爾曾謂、對已允許蘇聯之援助並無阻碍、此顯然表明指伊朗或日本兩國、</p>

<h3>蘇聯致伊照會全文</h3>
<p>塔斯社二十六日莫斯科電　二十五日蘇聯人民外交委員會委長莫洛託夫、在蘇聯政府訓令下、以下項牒文、至伊朗駐蘇全權大使摩漢默西特「蘇聯政府鑒於蘇聯對伊朗人民之友好情感　並為尊重伊朗主權起見、素採增强兩國友好之政策、蘇　伊之友好政策、可由一九一八年一月十四日及一九一九年六月二十六日蘇聯政府致伊之牒文加以證實、該項牒文叙述蘇對伊政策之原則及蘇伊所訂各恊定之細則、査蘇伊兩政府各恊定之不可更變原則、厥為尊重伊朗之獨立及領土完整、</p>
<p>蘇聯援助伊朗復興</p>
<p>依據此項原則、蘇聯政府在其一九一八年一月十四日牒文中、宣佈廢棄所有影響伊朗人民自由及獨立生存權利之恊定、蘇聯政府飛廢除伊方所應付帝俄政府之款項、並停止侵害伊朗之稅收、同時蘇聯政府更放棄有害伊朗國家主權之領事裁判權、（俄人憑藉該項權利可不受伊朗法庭之裁判）、此後、蘇政府並立即以若干企業交還伊朗人民、（包括鐵路、電綫及郵政等）、此外、貼現銀行一所及其產業亦經交還伊方、一九一八年一月十四日及一九一九年六月二十六日、蘇聯政府之行動、證明該政府恊助伊朗獲取政治及經濟繁榮之意志、在一九二一年二月二十六日之蘇伊恊定中、蘇聯政府復宣佈廢除伊朗與帝俄政府所簽訂妨害伊主權之恊定、而實行停止利用伊朗阿斯脫拉巴特省沿岸附近之阿雪達及其他各島、同時、蘇政府宣佈放棄帝俄貸伊借款之各項權利、蓋該借款係以奴役伊朗為目的也、至於充作該借款保證之伊朗稅收、蘇聯亦宣佈放棄、蘇聯政府除將一九一九年牒文中所開各企業交還伊方外、並以蘇菲亞島密恩湖鐵路車輛、以及島密恩湖船只等移交伊朗、此後數年中、蘇聯政府在經濟發展方面繼續予以援助、例如一九二四年七月三日、蘇聯與伊締結商約、在進出口方面予伊特殊權利、此外一九二六年之水量供給恊定、一九二七年漁業恊定、一九三五年農業恊定、一九三六年關於消滅蝗虫之恊定、一九四〇年之貿易恊定、以及其各項條約、均為蘇聯對伊友好之明證、蘇聯援助伊朗結果、伊方已在國民經濟方面、（如漁業棉業等）、建立大規模之門部、最近蘇聯已採取進一步之步驟增强並發展與伊朗之經濟關係、蘇方已允將極重要之貨物運伊、</p>
<p>蘇聯有權遣兵入伊</p>
<p>即在一九二一年二月二十六日締結主要恊定時、蘇伊雙方均已明瞭在增强兩國友好關係過程中所將遭遇之困難、而認為反蘇反伊份子將利用伊朗作攻蘇根據地、為消弭此項危機起見、蘇伊恊定第六條曾有如下之聲明、「締約雙方同意、凡在任何下列情形下、俄羅斯社會主義蘇維埃共和國聯邦、將有遣兵至波斯內部、進行軍事行動、但在危機消弭後、蘇聯政府當立即撤退其軍隊、（一）苟第三者企圖在波斯實施武力干涉政策、（二）苟第三强國企圖利用波土向俄羅斯社會主義蘇維埃共和國聯邦作戰、（三）苟某强國威脅蘇俄或共同盟國之邊境、而波斯政府在蘇俄提出警吿後、仍無法消弭此種威脅、由是觀之、伊政府已同意在一九二一年條約所述之危機發生後、蘇聯政府可進行保護蘇方在伊之權益、同時關於危機消除後、蘇軍退出伊境一點、亦已獲得保證、在一九二一年恊定實施二十年中、蘇聯從未認為有引用該恊定第六條之必要、</p>
<p>納粹陰謀威脅蘇聯</p>
<p>雖然、最近（攻蘇之後）、德納粹在伊之陰謀活動、更為擴大、而形成對蘇之重大威脅、德方人員在伊政府五十個部份中、佔據要職、企圖擾亂伊朗並將伊朗牽入對蘇作戰之旋渦中、納粹分子如拉丹諾維區、哈摩託、梅亞威爾漢、薩普等、藉在各德國商行服務為名、已組織　恐怖團體、企圖潛入蘇維埃阿什貝詹、蘇聯油區巴庫、及土克曼蘇維埃共和邦、在另一方面、彼等復圖在伊發動攻勢、最近德秘密人員領袖抵伊後極為活動、即與此事有關、德秘密人員領袖即哈摩託及梅亞、在德使館指導下、彼等已在德漢萊組成軍事隊伍、準備在伊朗邊境若干點移至巴庫及其他蘇聯邊境重要點、目的在蘇聯境內、縱火及炸裂各重要建築物、</p>
<p>德人在伊活動情形</p>
<p>在伊朗各地、德人員隨處均可覓得軍火供應、在伊北部梅恩附近、彼等已儲藏五十噸之爆炸物、又在德漢萊四週、彼等復藉口打獵、　行軍事練習、此外德秘密人員五十六人、潛入伊朗各軍事工厰、其中包括駐伊德商行克萊普脫著名德間諜亞特爾、西門子主持人拉道　維區、克溫·及北伊裏海沿岸德秘密人員首領華爾夫等、德人員之罪惡活動已破壞尊重伊朗領土完整之原則、而將伊土易為侵略蘇之根據　、由於上述種種、伊朗已充滿危機、因此、蘇聯政府不得不根據一九　　年恊定第六條、立即採取各種步驟、藉以自衛、</p>
<p>英蘇聯合警吿伊朗</p>
<p>自德侵蘇以來、蘇聯已三次（本年六月二十六日七月十九日及八月十六日、要求伊朗政府注意德人員在伊活動所引起之危機、六月二十六日、蘇聯政府　知伊方、謂蘇政府獲得可靠情報、德在伊人員確圖發動政變、七月十九日蘇聯聯同英國再度要求伊政府消除足以危害伊朗本身及各鄰邦利益之德人員活動、並力促伊方將德人員驅逐出境、良以德人員留伊與蘇　利益、實有極大之威脅也、最後蘇英政府於八月十六日第三次力促伊政方注意此項問題、要求阻止針對伊朗本身及蘇英利益之德人員活動、並將德人員驅逐出境、</p>
<p>伊不理會蘇始出此</p>
<p>因此、蘇聯已三次向伊朗提出警吿、但伊方竟拒絕採取步驟、此種態度、不啻鼓勵德人員加緊活動、職是之故、蘇聯政府不得不根據一九二一年恊定第六項遣兵入伊自衛、此種步驟、絕非針對伊朗人民、蘇聯政府絕無破壞伊國獨立及領土完整之企圖、蘇聯政府所採取之軍事步驟、純係針對德人員反蘇活動所引起之危機、此種危機一旦消弭後、蘇聯政府當即履行一九二一年蘇伊恊定之義務、將蘇聯軍隊自伊境撤退、</p>

<h3>紗花　時局之變化莫測　難乎其為棉紗投機　市面之乍升乍降正見其心神不寗</h3>
<p>近來之紗市、倐升倐降、此種狀態、全係投機商多空心神不奔所致、目前市上兩方之議論、進方謂現紗存底日見减縮、且廠方成本有增無减、而三二支單紗價格堅昂勿動、至於雜牌紗亦昂、紗市基礎、當可鞏固、但賣方謂高峯已見、國際局勢仍在動盪不定中、傾向拋賣撈帽子、如斯一來、足使市價飄忽靡定、客幫實銷不及上日之旺、因市面已見回風、亦暫觀望、因三二支紗堅硬如恒、不過雜牌紗爲上日在跳太厲、亦回下數十元、今日有棉紗八百〇五件運香港、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百〇九元、低價爲一千六百八十三四元、午後因人心大都翻空、市情續軟、開盤價爲一千六百八十七元、疲至八十二元、旋聞取引所紗布因行家無竟開貨、空方又復打劫扒補、而趨上升二三十元、布漲七八角至一元〇五分、雙馬隨之上漲至一千七百十一元、收盤價爲一千七百十元、漲過上午高價、紗市就根本上着想、當可安定、但投機的人們、越漲越買、一跌　賣、使得市面波浪浩大、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日後市取引所先挫人心鬆懈、首盤價爲一千六百九十元、少頃跌至八十六元、旋後聞取引所遠期回好、紗市帶挺、漲至一千七百〇七元、豈料布價回下、且空頭利用和平空氣、復來壓迫、形勢平庸、叉疲至一千六百八十元、同時上日買進巨量之同業因吃進額子太多、突來出檔一大半、市盤步步退落至一千六百八十七元、收盤以後做至一千六百八十二三元、查半日間成交統計八千八百七十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　三七〇　同行八、五〇〇</p>
<p>統計八、八七〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、於紊亂之氣氛中、趨勢極不整齊、　各方流言頻傳、利多利空、莫衷一是、以致人心忐忑、無從憑藉、故賣戶逢高拋出、而見低拉提者亦不乏其人、是以市價乍跌乍漲、終尙高升、當上午開出、先以美棉再降、廠單大爲軟弱、故影響期紗、人心大都轉趨下傾、乃浮多與空方之賣出、一時殊覺湧塞、丸月期開出爲五九三元、低落七元、十月期爲六二五元、軋小三元、入後因多方見低收購、遂稍回好、旋經不良消息所阻而脫手者、隨廠單之下傾、奮力出籠、大事賣出、市價突又轉軟、午收近期一六一〇元五角、十月期一六二七元、十一月期一六四六元、各有參差、前市成交一萬三千四白五十包、午後市態隨廠單之堅俏、緩步而上、脚地似較穩定、且以浮多堅持拉提、而取引所亦見回升、故紗價堅定、除近期獨平外、遠期各漲十二元至十九元不等、結果九月期爲一六一〇元、十月期爲一六四〇元五角、十一月期爲一六六四元收市、今日孔子誕辰、休業一天、觀趨勢、其脚地似頗浮盪、蓋國外之展開、與其他不良之因素、實爲買戶最人之顯忌、是以從事者於見高價時、當宜顧逢高之拋售也、全日共成交二萬三千五百三十包、比上日减少一萬三千八百三十包、又截至廿五日止、三個月存賬數量爲二萬三千四百九十包、內九月期存七千五百八十包、十月期存一萬〇一百七十包、十一月期　五千七百四十包、再將一日間開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>

<h3>定美棉有雙重便利　洋花交易依然熱鬧</h3>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况依然熱鬧、各方對於巴西棉之進意、無疑皆因能得標準外滙、及噸位頗多、而再接冉厲、目下不論其爲美印棉或巴西棉、若能於九十月抵滬之現貨、早爲各化號家及少數廠方購盡、故近日各外商棉業洋行之工作、無一不在努力定租美輪、或中立國船艘、以利中外商紗廠之繼續訂購也、昨日粽　成交美棉較稀外、巴西棉仍近一千包以上、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因總統羅斯福吾決司密期議案而跌、影響大衆不斷了結、及不利現貨貿易、但續後略因一部份空頭抵補再漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日的跌二三磅因、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進、及空頭抵補而漲、繼之又因多頭獲利了結而跌、但最後因空頭抵補、及經紀商買進而漲、結果昨日收盤價格、各漲一至四羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况頗平、與收盤價格無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>現棉情况、上午帶平、但午後因紗市一緊、粗絨棉尤爲俏俐、此因棉商心思高昂之故也、所以成交雖不暢、然九十月份海外行駛船隻尙不缺乏、人心亦難過分望升、</p>

<p>昨洋米市况、早市曾見一度平正、繼因日美妥協之說不利於多方、一般大戶咸爲震動、華洋商續有在市兜售、雖進戶鑒於英華司之猛落、亦不敢訂購、然市上旣有偌大存底、途貨又相繼來申、本街旣乏暢胃、客戶亦無需要、皮球幫等投機交易更不敢問津、市上買氣沉寂、賣聲頓鬧、現期各米即在浮戶貶價中一再下游、英華司有新到關係、東棧或恐封阻、允多降價急脫、收盤行情繼見暴跌三四元之鉅、若一號西貢已僅開百二十八元、二號暹邏百十四兀至百十一元半、敏黨白百三十元、普通百二十四元、决百十九元、至百十七元、小絞銀行棧百十五元、外棧百十四元、東京砶尖百零六元、碎尖九十元至八十六元、</p>

<p>厚薄粳國米、與洋米全然不同、素依內地來源之暢通與吾爲轉移、故昨雖洋米叉在猛跌、惟杜粳以到貨寥落、堅緊異常、售價繼續挺秀一二元、開南港早稻一百五十三元半一百五十三元、無錫原包特粳一百五十五元、大市一百五十元、决一百四十五六元、浦東新粳則因來源中斷無市、附吿今日爲孔聖誕日、市塲休業一天、</p>

<p>小麥　各廠鬥市收買爲數　微、因近郊來貨稀寥、欲購不易多得、各廠進價、亦少變動、聞日廠進價爲四十五元、華廠仍爲四十八九元云、</p>

<p>下午未聞成交</p>

<p>香港匯市呆定</p>
<p>香港二十六日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤甚爲呆悶、申滙現貨仍未開出、其餘亦無榮辱、</p>

<h3>外幣重歸平淡</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、現金跌風已戢、故英美金鎊亦平穩、英金票趨勢亦穩、市價站平、美金票開盤一千九百三十三元、開後同益鼎和等售出退爲二十一元、同益轉購、利記惠豐等亦購、午收抬至三十四元、午後開盤仍爲三十四元、開後洽泰永振和等售出、退爲二十二元、晚收一千九百三十元、此昨計低一元、成交數的二十五萬元、現貨略退爲二十一元八角，香港票趨勢軟弱、市價下落一角、日金票僅降一分、晚市退爲二元四角八分、朝鮮票　趨漲勢、晚市高至一元九角八分、</p>
<h3>證券　債市堅穩</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市因謠言有和平空氣、丙種驟抬至九元外、午後消息不能　實、復又回鬆、依然未能脫離盤旋狀况、帶息時之興奮情形、已成過去、目下尙在盤。醞釀、必俟八月底第一期本息收到後、始有正式漲風、咋日上午怡泰聯益久豐同康買進、大中先入後出、丙　會一度穿出九元、以仁　猛出三十萬、新華現貨繼續流出、潤德九成德隆亦有賣出、午收加小半元、午後怡泰聯益繼續買進、九成補回、裕興亦稍有買進、信昌忽賣出廿萬、德隆轉賣生大亦有賣出、行市則稍稍趨堅、結果除丁種未有做開外、餘均續好一二角、成交約一百二十萬之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>平準會在港集議　兩專家奉召出席　已作離此準備行期未明　滬匯管理方案即有決定</h3>
<p>平準基金委員會特派駐滬業已半月之美幫辦泰萊博士、及方於日前來滬調查滙市實情之英籍委員霍爾巴樞氏、突於昨晨接到平準會香港臨時辦事處發來之緊急電報、促即速離滬赴港、與頃自渝飛折香港之平準會主席陳光甫。華委席德懋·貝淞　·及美委福克斯等共同會議、對上海外滙官理問題、作最後之決定與核准、</p>
<p>兩氏已作　赴港準備</p>
<p>自平準會宣佈自八月十八日起、照新價格供給必需品外滙後、駐滬之泰萊博士、遂連日與滬各有關銀行商討結滙之基本原則、益以英委霍爾已樞之奉派來滬、參予會議、結果已擬定一實施辦法、規定集中由港平準會施行、但該項辦法有待核准、故平準基金委昌會實有召開全體會議之必要、泰·霍兩氏此去、將對上海匯市情形、作詳細報吿、幷以在滬擬訂之方案、提交全體討論、作最後之決定、昨據都城飯店及英大使署消息、泰霍兩氏昨仍留滬、惟確有赴港之準備、至其行期、關係各方尙未允透露、但必不致過久、</p>
<p>合法需要　必予供給</p>
<p>昨據關係銀行方　指出、中國法幣基礎、以平準基金會竭力維持匯率、顯將日趨鞏固、合法商人請求外匯時、若能證明其所進口之貨物爲必需品、同時爲友邦國家之貨品、則必能獲得五元三四二七五之美匯、或三辦士一八七五之英滙、加之中國之外匯平準基金及現存外國之外匯準備極爲富足、足供任何合法需要而有餘、</p>
<p>物價今後　可望下降</p>
<p>至於上海方面、法幣匯率之跌落、原因甚多、如海關稅收之旁落、日貨之輸入淪陷區域、黑市之投機、內地及租界中之資金逃避、中國政府無法在租界中執行權力以及進口商之投機等均是、蓋政府若照往昔滙率維持法幣地位、則結果反有利於非必要品之進口商及奸人之套滙、惟使法幣匯率尋求較爲自然之價格、而照此價格、對必需品供給外匯、乃爲當局賢明之　動、不能視爲法幣眞正之疲弱、而物價之高漲、實際上非爲法幣疲弱之結果、僅係奸商投機操縱所致、一俟結匯方法嚴格實施、物價可望下降、</p>
<p>已定辦法　有待核准</p>
<p>關於泰萊博十及霍爾巴樞兩氏在滬銀行界所擬訂之結匯辦法、事實上已得各銀行各進口商之擁戴、此項辦法、待泰·霍·兩氏提交即將在港舉行之平準委會全體會議討論決定予以核准後、即將付諸全面之實施、由於上述、可知實施之結果、一爲法幣基礎之鞏固、二爲物價之回跌、二爲進口貿易之保障、如以上四　能圓滿達到、本市之惡勢力即可消滅大部份、泰·霍·兩氏赴港後路、泰氏仍將來滬擔任督導之責、霍氏或將隨同其他委員返渝、就各方面觀察、此决香港小準會議、必有空前美滿之牧穫也、</p>
<h3>公共汽車昨擬定復工　臨時發生波折　誤會解釋後駛車已不及　當局業予竭力設法調處</h3>

<p>臨時波折</p>
<p>前日談妥之先決條件、規定公司允竭力設法改善人事管理制度、並接受增加工人津貼原則、俟工人先行復工後，再行開誠談判、於是昨晨六時、機務·車務工人前往復工、在康腦晚路公司門首、因一部份工人、對先決條件不甚滿意、以致發生波折、復工未成、當局得報後、即派幹員馳往、向罷工工人勸吿、遵照先決條件應先復工、並派大批探捕保護、</p>
<p>接受勸告以至上午十一時、工人接受勸告、再往復工、因事前未與公司接洽妥當、以致與俄籍管理員發生誤會、再度復工人又未成功、旋經公司邀集工人代表解釋誤會、惟準備復工之工人、均已先後散去、現公司及當局、已設法再向工人勸導、允對工人之增加津貼問題、由當局負責設法調處、並制止公司無故開除工人、今日有復工之可能、</p>

<p>出入虹口　昨受嚴查</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨（廿王日）夜九時、虹口區有日陸軍僱用之平民下部信吉（三十六歲）與須籘茂吉（廿六歲）兩人、行經西華德路兆豐路口、突遭狙擊、兇手逸去、下部身中八彈、當塲氣絕、須籘頭胸部亦中彈、經飛送醫院、由日軍醫施以急救、延至今日（廿六日）午前十二時三十分、傷重身死、日海軍當局迄今仍在虹口區大事偵查、並嚴密搜查出入虹口之行人與車輛、致今晨蘇州河上各橋樑上交通擁擠、乘車者均須下車、以便日哨兵審慎搜查，據咋晨之槍殺案、爲過去一週內、虹口區日人第三次遭狙擊、前座次被暗殺之日籍平民、係日商紗廠中職員、</p>

<h3>中國職員階級生活費　編製批數方法　（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 蔡正雅</p>
<p>如何記帳</p>
<p>記帳一事原非至難，所難者，在持之以恒耳。最好方法，全家人備小册，隨時記入，入晚，彙交主婦，登入帳册，然此就一般家庭言，要當視各家情形而變通之，總以簡便易行爲主，若過於繁重，則或不免於虎頭蛇尾，記帳本爲良好習慣，一家而有詳細收支帳目，則逐年遂月，可以造成預算，收支何至不能相扺？準此而言，即不爲編製指數計，亦有提倡之必要，兒童幼而習此，對於將來，允大有用處也。</p>
<p>家庭選擇</p>
<p>本處所定選擇記帳家庭標準，共分六項，已見報端，茲不複述。然亦有數端，仍須說明書：（一）「不依賴祖遺產業收入，家長津貼」一語，指數目大者而言，若祖上略有薄產，家長偶予補助者，仍得入選，蓋所重在「自立門戶」一語也。（二）「寄厲服務處所而不需納付房租一一語，指全不付費者而言，若付小額租金者，仍得入選。（三）一薪津以不出法幣一千元爲限」一語，指收入言，至於支出多寡，並無規定。</p>
<p>本處選擇記帳家庭，收入在五百元以下者，應占十之七，五百至一千元者，十之三。其故由於收入較少者，家數較多，比例上不得不然也。收支亦以芷常者爲主。設所入微細，而所出浩大，相差極遠者，是爲不正常。例如收入　有二三百元，而支出高至二三千元，另有抱注方法者是。不正常者，記帳之時，或不免於隱飾，以多報少，以少報多，則編爲指數，不能正確也。</p>
<p>本處此决擬微求記帳家庭五百家，然欲達此數，則非數倍之小可，其故由於共中或有一維持之以恒，或所記不盡可用，須經嚴格選擇。　記載翔實。歷久不懈，則本處所費時間，以及人力財力，均可减省不少也。</p>
<p>帳冊嚴守望秘密</p>
<p>本處對於各　庭所記之快，嚴守秘密。本處收到應徵信件之後，卽行編號，帳册之上，只載號碼，不載姓名，分析人員，全不知某冊爲誰某，絕無洩漏之可能。統計職員，曾受相當敎育，咸知自愛，故應徵家庭，儘可放心也。</p>
<p>發收帳冊手續</p>
<p>在手續方面本處接到應徵信件後，審查合格，函復登記。至九月底寄奉帳册及記帳須知各一册，並附封套，印好本處地址記畢一月，至决月一日，投入郵筒，無須加貼郵票。帳冊每月須凖時寄回，以便審查分析。三月事畢後，關於房租及僕役工洋，每三個月函詢一次，仍乞寄復也。</p>
<p>本研究之貢獻</p>
<p>將來指數編成後，物價升降，對於生活之影響易見，用以調整薪給津貼，調解雇主及雇員間之爭執，不致漫無標準。此外更有其他貢獻，例如營養問　，亦其一端。西僑生活程度硏究編成，曾請雷士德醫學研究院詳加分析，始知俄　營養不　，英　美僑食糖　　。我國人體格健全者少，患肺病者比比皆是，此與營養方面有　。營養品不在數量之多，價値之高，而在勻稱與吾，有此詳細帳目，一經分析，大可硏究。此不過問題之一而已，舉以示例，餘不　述</p>
<p>總之，此决編製生活費指數，事關公益，全賴社會人士，協力合作，俾觀厥成，鄙人謹代工業社會處致謝。（完）</p>

<h3>「客滿搞網」種種</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>天堂？地獄？繁榮？其他？</p>
<p>耍是有人問到孤島的特微是什麼？「客滿」或許是一切的一切！</p>
<p>別小覤了這兩個多簡單的字！「客滿」，裏而眞不知蘊藏着多少天堂，多少地獄！多少黑暗，多少矛盾！</p>
<p>戲院，是「客滿」的最得意之作！瞧「上下客滿」的霓虹字，發出驕傲的光綫來，在向被摒在鐵門外的觀衆示威！</p>
<p>「明天請早」，失敗　從新計劃明天的勝利，參與這「滿」之羣！</p>
<p>我奇怪菜館門口站着的「癟三」那們摩登？不，原來並不是癟　，乃是候補菜館空座的！</p>
<p>儘你「大菜二元一客」，「全席二百元起」，孤島有的是錢，結果：「客滿」！</p>
<p>旅館已經叫做「飯店」了，因此也就不是「安頓客商」之所了！代起爲「客」的，是麻將，女人，酒！有這三樣，還怕不客滿牌高掛？</p>
<p>「嗐，那裏是跳舞，簡直是在炒花生米」！</p>
<p>別笑這位「鄉瓜」的話，這正是舞塲中「滿」的寫眞哩！</p>
<p>靡靡的音樂，妖媚的女人，發泡的酒，和飛着的鈔票，流着的臭汗，充實了這「滿」的陣容！</p>
<p>電桿木頭上「召和」的紅條兒，幾年前曾被人當作「天皇皇，地皇皇」一般地無聊；現在啦，成了寳貝了，偶一發現新大陸，搶着租頂，捷足者還有捷足！</p>
<p>您可看見過「一上一下住一百〇八人」的新聞？今天一般住宅中「滿」的狀况，眞不敢想象！——像棕棚縫裹臭蟲一般地擠，像棺材　　首一般地拘束！</p>
<p>「攔樓」，「地鋪」，「鉛皮棚」，——這　多「客滿」的產物！</p>
<p>難民所的「客滿」是聞名的，自從裁撤了幾處以後，僅存的更顯得「人滿爲患」。</p>
<p>國難，畸形地興起了一班人，把物品往棧房裏送，於是，洋棧，堆棧，一律「客滿」。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「監獄客滿！」</p>
<p>生活，環境，迭成了廣泛的犯罪者——搶刦，捲逃，姦褻，…其他。</p>
<p>電車賣票員使勁地拉：「等下一部！」</p>
<p>公共汽車司門人向紳土們連連地說：客滿！</p>
<p>祥生，雲飛回說：「沒有空車！」</p>
<p>旅行社職員向旅客擺：「永生輪房艙已全部定完！」</p>
<p>您如果生了病，到個「名醫」那邊求醫，掛一個普通號，包您從天明等到天午，還挨不上，除非您冉掏出幾張法幣來作「拔號費」！</p>
<p>旣然有病，就也有「死」，死了人，只好朝殯儀館一送，因此，殯儀館也宣吿客滿了。</p>
<p>殯儀館的寄柩所，可說完全是二房東式，有寬如「客堂」，有雅如「亭子問」，也有擠如「擱樓」的。殯儀館再三造「新所出租」，還是不够支　；看去在不久的將來，柩所定規也有什麽「出頂」「小費」「押租」這一類玩意兒會出來！</p>
<p>「客滿」……</p>
<p>「客滿照牌頭！」孤島的豪語，也就不出這一句話！</p>
<p>「客滿」！是繫榮？是罪惡？够使孤島驕傲？</p>
<p>我想這小是一個謎，誰都會您的淸楚！</p>
<h3>看到想到</h3>
<p>— 沛</p>
<p>法租界鄭家木橋左近，有一家小吃兼冷飲的館子，門口掛着一塊紅牌，上面寫着：「哈哈！秋老虎來了，本店各抓冷飲，一應俱全。」這雖是一塊普通招徠顧客的廣吿牌，，但秋老虎來了就秋老虎來了，「哈哈」二字加在上而却是滑稽。</p>
<p>文氣奇特之至，着即，嘉獎！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>梅寳是知道她父親的性格的，自己不走，耍他先走，就從來沒有一决答應過，便只得勉强裝出笑容來，隨在小狗子的背後，沿着一條泥和煤屑堆築成的小路，一步一步的往西走去。</p>
<p>她照例又回頭去望了幾决，只見她父親穿着一身灰色布的棉襖褲，直挺挺地站在寒風裏，向自己道一邊看着。上幾回梅寳進城，秋海棠也往往站在自家的門口或路的中央，痴痴地望着他女兒的背影，但小均總亦梅寳第四次或一第五次旋過頸去時不見了；而這一决，他却不一但一直送到市梢口，而且老是呆望着不就走回一去。當梅寳走出了四五十丈路，將要轉灣的時候，還可以遠遠地望見这一條糢糊的人影。</p>
<p>「奇怪，我進城去念書已有三年了，這一决爸爸爲什麽格外顯得躭心起來？」她忍不住輕輕地向小狗了說。</p>
<p>小狗子倒也來得爽快。</p>
<p>「道都是你自己想學唱戲的不好啊！姑娘，往後你千萬別冉胡鬧了。我侍候了他七八年工夫，瞧他最疼愛的，就祗一個你，要是眞鬧出了什麽事來，不是我要說你」……小狗子原是一直低着頭在前面走，說到這一句，才回過頭來向梅寳看了一看：「姑娘，你心上又怎麽對得起他老人家？」</p>
<p>梅寳雖也覺得小狗子的話說得很對，但還不信自己跟尙老二間所發生的這麼一件小糾紛，再會牽纏或擴大到何種地步。（一九五）</p>
<h3>教師節的希望</h3>
<p>— 胡洛</p>
<p>小學教師的生活問題，已嚴重到極點了，一些舍本逐末的硏究對事實是毫無裨益的，許多有經騐的敎師已投向別的職業部門，許多對敎育有興趣，願意硏究的敎師，一天敎了學校，父敎門館，爲了生活，把全部時問和精神佔去，把對敎育的硏究興趣無形斷送，這樣下去，敎育的前途頗爲不幸</p>
<p>關心敎育的針會人士們，請仲出你們友誼的手來吧！幫助小學敎師活下去，就是幫助了敎育的正常發展和進步也就是幫助了後一代的孩子們，連你們自己的孩子也在內的。</p>
<p>自己生活的改善，是應該用自己的力量去爭得的，掙扎在飢餓綫上的小敎同仁們，請不要獨自懊　，獨自悲歎。</p>
<p>這裏謹向小敎同仁社會人士提供兩點建議，希望拋磚引玉，以後能有更具體更切實的辦法源源提出：</p>
<p>第一，希望於社會人士，敎育團體，學校當局的。本市從下學期起，果然有一部分開明的學校當局，可能把增加的學費，大部分配在敎師薪金方面，但是一部分校長，並不如此，所以我要請學校當局應予他們以更大的同情。</p>
<p>第二；希望於敎師本身的：大家來辦理米煤等必需品的消費合作事業，向工部局，煤球廠以及其他廠家直接接洽，要求减低售價，以輕敎師負擔。像義泰興煤球廠，過去曾訂有優待小學敎員辦法，如經小學敎師正式請求，一定能得更大優待的。</p>
<p>小敎同仁們！請切實紀念我們的節日，我們是要活下去的，爲了敎育，爲了兒童，爲了我們的責任，我們甘願忍受一切痛苦，渡過這苦難的時代。</p>
<h3>關於打醮問題</h3>
<p>— 徐洵</p>
<p>日前讀了朱君的「又要打醮了嗎？」一文以後，我有一點小小的意見提供出來。</p>
<p>「打醮」這玩意兒，在上海的確大都是另有其作用的，這祇是一般游手好閑之徒作爲一種斂錢的方法罷了。</p>
<p>他們籍着打醮的名義去向當地的居民「勸」，而目的只是飽其私囊，供其消耗罷了。在現在的社會情形下他們也會說着各物飛漲開支浩大的話，而要每一居民至少化上二三元法幣，多的也許五六元不等。一般居民，看到他們平日的行爲，有些見了他們討厭，有些見了害怕（人或鬼），而都會很忍痛地，爽快地賞給他們。他們也就抓住了這種心理的躬點，每年這樣很自然的來一决「收穫」。（有道種打醮舉動發生的地方大概是一般平民所居住的處所，他們並不富有；所以說，他們付出這些錢是忍痛的。）</p>
<p>他們，這般特殊份子，各佔一個區城，有定的界限，互相不許侵犯。但是在往年打醮的季節裏，我們時常可以聽到他們爲了地盤的爭執而引起了「全武行」，「大打出手」的新聞。</p>
<p>總之，這打醮的舉動，對於居民的安全，　會的秩序都有問題。我們應該設法使其斂跡。</p>
<p>最好的方法是居民應該在這米珠薪桂的時候，拒付這種不必要付的款項。那麼，在他們收不到錢之後，是可以少費心機了。（稿酬作助學金）</p>
<h3>小統計</h3>
<p>— 福星</p>
<p>「打醮」一次假設需錫箔二百元，顏色紙三十元，道士或和尙一百元，人工五十元，租借器具六十元，其他雜支六十元；上海假使每年有一千個弄堂在打醮，每年則需五十萬元。若用於慈善事業，則每年可多救活許許多多人</p>
<h3>廢話</h3>
<p>— 自羽</p>
<p>主人：你燒菜的本領大極了。</p>
<p>廚司：爲什麽？</p>
<p>主人：因你燒的肉絲細而且短怪小玲巧的，戴了顯微鏡切恐也不能呢！</p>
<p>廚司：……恐這也是錢的關係吧！</p>
<p>主人：……。</p>
<h3>胡扯</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>理髮者：腦後的頭髮最好再剪短一點，否則不多幾天就會長了許多，怪討厭的。</p>
<p>理髮匠：先生！這是挺容易解決的問題。只要一個月裏多來兩决好了。</p>

<h3>壽春壺齋曲話</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>捉放曹之心得　（下）</p>
<p>我想：以後再唱這戲時，也照如此辦法，多上幾個不同色的人，就是全後臺的人上塲都可以，一來叫曹操殺個痛快，二來也使臺下人看着覺得傷慘，由上塲門跑上去，從下塲門就下了，雖說是被殺了，其實不會損傷一根毫毛，輕而易舉，何妨一試。</p>
<p>（三）曹操殺畢呂氏家眷人等，陳宮追上，通常曹操這時來一僩轉身，可舉劍作砍下之狀，這時陳宮驚怕狀，唱下句「唬得我三魂七魄忙，」一句，普通扮陳宮的人，以爲他的怕，是怕的曹操手中明晃晃血淋淋的劍，幾乎也砍到自己頭上來。所以眼神還在高望而唱這句，千人演此，大致皆同，我獨覺不然。我以爲，陳宮追下追上，是想攔阻他殺人惹禍，不意走遲一步，忽見尸橫滿地，人頭亂滾，鮮血直流，知已聞了大禍，怕的是這個，並非怕曹操殺他，曹操並未殺他也。或間：曹操的劍，確舉過了陳宮的頭，豈不甚險？我說，非也，此乃上塲法，故作驚人之筆，曹操的劍，和陳宮的頭，毫無親近之意也。旣然如此，所以陳宮出塲時，這個樣子仍不妨做，做過之後，趕快起來，往前走幾步，眼望地下及四下裹來回一看，再唱「唬得我」一句，則較妥善，不知海內專家，以爲如何？</p>
<h3>訪天風劇社</h3>
<p>— 盧斯</p>
<p>最近聽說「淸宮怨」將重行改編與陣容將更換的消息，並據說英茵或有登臺之希望，這倒是一件很有趣味的事，然天風下期劇目「淘金記」已有預吿，究竟情形如何，不得而知，記者遂走訪天風劇社，得該社負責人回答諸問題，茲記錄於下：</p>
<p>（問）：「淸宮怨」是吾有改編的消息？</p>
<p>（答）：是的，因爲姚克先生初稿時，較爲忽促，而上演時，又因時間太長，删改甚多，自不免有許多不滿之處，本來祇預備演十天後即行改寫，後因觀衆太多，欲罷不能，故展延至今，現姚先生決意改寫，去蕪存菁，使其格外生動，格外有力。</p>
<p>（問）：據說陣容也將更動？</p>
<p>（答）：本來天熱戲重，演員就很難支持，現在旣有新編本，有幾個演員不妨藉此略略休息，然而大部份演員，仍不予以更動。</p>
<p>（問）新更動者是吾貴社基本演員？</p>
<p>（答）：不一定，不過原則上總是儘先用本社演員的。</p>
<p>（問）外傳英茵巳接受天風邀請將參加演出，有這事嗎？</p>
<p>（答）：本社未向她邀請，當然談不上接受演出了。</p>
<p>（問）：新陣容已吾排練好？</p>
<p>（答）：尙在排練中，最近費穆先生每日來社導演。</p>

<h3>If the Anglo-American Declaration Is Not Realized, China Vows to Fight to the End; Vice President Kung Is Confident That America Will Uphold Justice; US-Japan Negotiations Will Be Based on the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 20th (United Press) - Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Dr. H.H. Kung, yesterday approved of Churchill's remarks, saying that China is not worried about hearing of US-Japan negotiations. Kung stated, "I have welcomed the Eight Principles procedure proposed by Mr. Churchill, and I am now pleased to hear Mr. Churchill's message. From China's standpoint, I dare to believe that any US-Japan negotiations will be based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Eight Principles procedure. Therefore, China does not need to be apprehensive about the outcome of the negotiations." He also said that he dared to believe that "friendly countries will never betray China. I believe they will uphold justice and take into account the national rights of all countries in the world." Kung explained that the formulation of the Nine-Power Treaty was not only for the benefit of China and the Pacific, but also took into account the entire world. The principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration are based on world peace and order. Kung declared, "I deeply know that President Roosevelt will understand that if such principles are ignored and despised, it will cause danger and chaos, and will inevitably lead to war. I know that President Roosevelt will insist that Japan recognize these principles as the basis for reaching any solution." Kung expressed his belief that if Japan does not comply, there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution. Kung also said, "We have adhered to these principles and will fight to the end for these principles. We have been fighting for four years, and if necessary, we will fight for another four years or forty years to realize these principles." Kung also said that he felt that the eight principles of Roosevelt and Churchill had given a good omen for the future of the world, and Churchill's speech further clarified the situation and showed that Britain would fully cooperate with the United States to the end.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th - When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, someone asked what the British Prime Minister meant by saying that the United States was making every effort to reach an agreement with Japan. Hull acknowledged that he had engaged in some informal talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura, but no agreement had been reached. The Secretary of State insisted that any solution to Far Eastern problems must be based on the ten points he himself announced in July 1937. According to well-informed sources, there is no doubt that the US and Japan are conducting talks in Washington. However, Hull has made it clear to Nomura that if Japan continues its aggression, the United States will not compromise with Japan and will further exert economic pressure on Japan. Hull refused to announce whether Japan had proposed an outline for resolving US-Japan issues, or whether US Ambassador to Japan Grew had received proposals from the Japanese side. Various parties have also speculated whether the United States is willing to maintain the status quo with Japan, allowing Japan to temporarily occupy Vietnam and discuss the entire Far East issue after the war, or whether the United States will break with Japan. Churchill's assurance that he would do his best to help the United States in the event of a US-Japan war is the first time in British history that such a thorough guarantee of obligation has been made to the United States regarding its Far East policy. Qualified observers generally believe that Japanese moderates are still unable to change the Japanese government's aggressive policies, and Japanese warmongers are still unwilling to give up their southward advance.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull warned Japan today against further aggression, declaring that the United States could not compromise on Pacific issues until Japan ceased its armed conquest. Hull said that the eight points announced by the United States at the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War remain the goals of the United States. He then listed the details of the eight principles calling for the adoption of negotiation methods and the prohibition of the use of force. Hull stressed that the United States insists that its Far Eastern rights must be preserved, and said that the US and Japan are currently conducting informal negotiations. However, Washington officials pointed out that, according to the articles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy, if the relevant powers also participate in the negotiations, the current disputes between the US and Japan can be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull spoke with Japanese Ambassador Nomura on Saturday. It was revealed that the US and Japan still adhere to their respective policies. Therefore, the State Department believes that the Far Eastern situation is extremely fragile. It is said that Nomura requested the United States to stop aiding Chongqing in exchange for Japan's willingness to quickly resolve all issues concerning the Far East with the United States. Hull pointed out to Nomura that if Japan remains a member of the Axis powers and insists on its "New Order Policy" aimed at dominating the Western Pacific by force, then the United States will find it difficult to make any concessions to Japan, and it will also be impossible. However, it is reported that Hull also told Nomura that if Japan adopts a friendly attitude and is willing to achieve its goals through peaceful means, then the United States is fully willing to negotiate all Far Eastern issues with Japan.</p>
<p>Jenson Says US Determined Policy to Fully Aid China As It Aids Britain</p>
<p>Honolulu, 26th (United Press) - US Minister to Australia, Jenson, and his wife, eight-year-old son Nelson, and six-year-old daughter Patty, arrived here yesterday aboard the American ship "Mariposa" en route to Australia to take up their posts. Jenson told reporters that there have been no changes in the United States' Far East policy. He also said, "The United States has formulated a policy of aiding China as it aids Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, Japan has been the focus of the world's attention. The country is still in its former position."</p>
<p>Britain and the United States No Longer Appease Japan, but the Door to Peace Is Still Open</p>
<p>Manila, 26th (Reuters) - The Manila "Tribune" commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast, saying that democratic countries have opened the door of honor to peace, but the path of appeasement has indeed been completely closed. Churchill's words almost reaffirmed this meaning. Churchill declared that democratic countries are engaged in a war to destroy Nazism, and Churchill regards Japan, which seeks to create a new order, as the main follower of Nazism in the Far East. Churchill's words indicate that the strength of resistance to aggressors is increasing and will continue to expand. Although it is still dark at present, the light will be seen in the near future. The newspaper also detailed the Iranian incident, saying that Britain and the Soviet Union have benefited from the teachings of Iraq and the Balkans, and have now preemptively acted to prevent the Axis powers from occupying important oil areas and the gateway to India.</p>
<p>Tefft Couber Warns Japan That Reckless Actions Will Inevitably Lead to Misfortune</p>
<p>San Francisco, 26th (International) - Former British Minister of Information Tefft Couber dismissed his position as the British government's Far East liaison officer, comparing it to that of the Governor of India, saying, "I must ensure that I will be able to fully cooperate and will have good efficiency, and will never interfere with the rights of the Far Eastern governments." The newly appointed Far East liaison officer and his wife, Diana G., left San Francisco today by fast plane for Singapore.</p>
<p>San Francisco, 26th (United Press) - Tefft Couber warned Japan yesterday, saying, "Now is not the time to engage in imperialist adventures in the Far East." He said, "I can assert that it is too late for Japan to take any action now. A year ago, when we withdrew from Dunkirk, we were running out of ammunition and food. Japan should have acted at this time. Whatever action Japan wants to take, it should have gone all out at that time."</p>
<p>Chongqing, 26th (United Press) - Second Secretary of the British Embassy, Yalin, and his wife left Chongqing by plane yesterday for Singapore to serve as assistants to Tefft Couber, the former British Minister of Information who now holds an important position in the Far East.</p>
<p>Singapore, 26th (Reuters) - Yesterday, more Indian troops arrived here to increase the strength of the Malayan defense forces. Among them were infantry, artillery, and engineering teams, who disembarked in various places, all fully equipped. A large number of air force officers and soldiers came from England, the largest number in a year.</p>
<p>Japanese Government Spokesman Reveals US-Japan Negotiations Cover a Wide Range</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters today that we are in the position of the government and do not want to comment on the broadcast speech made by British Prime Minister Churchill, but the comments of various newspapers are enough to reflect Japanese public opinion. When asked whether the Japanese government welcomes the negotiations with Japan to reach a fair and peaceful solution to the Far East issue mentioned in Churchill's speech, Ishii replied that if the five people can obtain a reasonable conclusion, they will naturally be welcome. When asked whether the overall situation has developed to the point where such negotiations can be held, Ishii replied that this must be determined by the situation. At that time, many people asked questions about the US-Japan negotiations. Ishii also replied that he was sorry that he did not know. When asked whether Waksugi, the diplomatic advisor to Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura, brought back concrete suggestions when he returned to China, Ishii replied no, but admitted that the member would return to China in the near future. He also said that although several reports have been sent to the government regarding Nomura's meetings with US authorities, he did not know the progress of the talks in Washington. What Nomura and the US authorities are discussing should be matters of common concern to Japan and the United States, but Nomura has a wide range of discretion, he said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast was aimed at alienating Thailand from Japan. Churchill was also anachronistic, because the Sino-Japanese conflict occurred before the European war, so Japan is not imitating Hitler. China's construction is cooperative, Vietnam's advance is voluntary, and the only one putting pressure on Southeast Asia is Britain. Officials said they had not heard anything about the US-Japan basic negotiations implied by Churchill. They have not recently received reports from Ambassador Nomura to the United States.</p>
<h3>US Entry Into War Not Far Off, Prediction of US Senators</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 26th (International News Service) - Senator Johnson predicted today that the US will enter the war within two months, "or will launch on several fronts simultaneously."</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) - Ohio Republican Senator Taft said yesterday that British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on Sunday indicated that British leaders believed that President Roosevelt had "guaranteed that the United States would enter the war." Taft also said, "Churchill's words are intended to instigate the American people to help Britain fight."</p>
<h3>US Gasoline Transport to Soviet Union Issue, US and Japan Conducting Negotiations, If British and Soviet War in Iran Succeeded, US Can Open Up Safe Supply Line</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Reuters) - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii admitted today while receiving reporters that Japan and the United States are negotiating the issue of the United States transporting oil to the Soviet Union, but said that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Takekawa has not held talks with Soviet authorities. When asked about reports that US oil tankers will be escorted to Vladivostok with convoys, Ishii replied that he was not aware of this matter. When asked about the freezing of American funds, Ishii replied that the Japanese government strictly adheres to the principle of reciprocity. He also said that he believed that the Dutch East Indies freezing regulations were not harsh. As for the issue of restoring trade with the Dutch East Indies, it is currently under discussion and much progress has been made. When asked whether Article 9 of the 1905 Portsmouth Treaty stipulates that the Soya and Tartary Straits will not be fortified and will be open to free navigation, Ishii replied that this article must be interpreted in light of the changed international situation.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (United Press) - Qualified sources here declared yesterday that if the British and Soviet war in Iran succeeds, the United States will likely use the guns of the Pacific Fleet to protect the transportation of military supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union. After the British and Soviet forces meet in Iran, the final link of the Pacific supply line of military importance can be completed. The line starts from the west coast of the United States, passes through British Malaya to India and the Persian Gulf, and then crosses Iran or the Caspian Sea to the southeastern part of the Soviet Union. The United States Pacific Fleet can guarantee the safety of the transportation route without leaving the Pacific. Therefore, it has broken the Axis's hope of forcing the American fleet into the Pacific, so that Japan can freely engage in its extension program in the South Pacific. The route will be safe outside the war zone and will shorten the current route through the Red Sea and Egypt to the Middle East.</p>
<h3>US President Sets September 1st for Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt's broadcast on Monday, September 1st, will be one of the highlights of the sixty-minute Labor Day broadcast program prepared by the Production Management Office. British Labor Minister Bevin will also broadcast from London that day as part of the program. At that time, both the National and Columbia Broadcasting Companies will broadcast across the United States. In addition, those participating in the broadcast include Green of the American Federation of Labor and Hillman, Assistant Director of the Production Management Office.</p>
<h3>Germany Shows Impatience, Calls on Japan to Unite</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (United Press) - The Director of the Information Office of the German Embassy, ​​Gerduen, told the Japanese press today, "Churchill's speech is a curse against our Axis camp representing justice." He accused the purpose of Churchill's speech of being to divide the Axis camp in a cunning way. The British conspiracy is to divide and then rule, so we Axis members should be extremely careful, he said.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Prime Minister Visits Roosevelt to Review the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Pa ​​Dimo, 26th (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser told visiting reporters yesterday that the Far East situation will be the main topic of discussion in his talks with President Roosevelt. Although the situation there is serious, it is not irreversible. British Prime Minister Churchill has already spoken on behalf of all of us to warn Japan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Thailand Newly Appoints Acting Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 26th (United Press) - Thai Prime Minister General Songgram yesterday appointed Police Chief and Interior Minister Churas to act as his acting Prime Minister and other positions on his behalf. The Prime Minister explained this matter, saying that when he is unable to handle official affairs, he will act on his behalf to carry out national affairs, so as to avoid dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Expels Two Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Reuters) - According to Japanese sources, two Japanese reporters representing "Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun" have been ordered to leave the country by the Dutch East Indies government and have now returned to Japan. The Dutch East Indies government refused to issue them residence permits because it was dissatisfied with the editorials of the two newspapers. According to today's statement, there are currently five Japanese reporters in the Dutch East Indies, including three from Domei, one from "Asahi Shimbun", and one from "Yomiuri Shimbun".</p>
<h3>Soviet Official Denies Sino-Soviet Conference</h3>
<p>Moscow, 26th (TASS) - "Asahi Shimbun" reported on August 23 that Sino-Soviet representatives held a conference in Chita in the first half of August, and that the Chinese representatives participating in the conference totaled sixteen people, discussing issues related to Japan for a week. This kind of rumor was already denied by the Soviet official on August 5. "Asahi Shimbun" is now rehashing the old story. TASS specially authorized an official statement to solemnly declare that this report is purely fabricated and absolutely inaccurate.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Conjecture, Ideals, and Illusions</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill's speech the day before yesterday formally announced that the United States and Japan are conducting important negotiations on the Far East situation. If we only try to interpret this speech, we still cannot get a relatively clear idea of ​​the specific scope and goals of the US-Japan negotiations. But generally speaking, there are of course three possibilities: (1) Thoroughly force Japan to accept the democratic countries' views on the future world situation, which includes canceling the East Asian New Order, withdrawing from the Axis alliance, and complying with the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions on China's territorial sovereignty. This is the most fundamental solution. (2) In order to meet the urgent needs of the current situation, the UK and the US, on the issue of the Tripartite Pact, ask Japan to provide guarantees that it will not respond to the German and Italian war against the UK and the Soviet Union. On the issue of Japan's foreign expansion, they will force it to make a promise not to continue advancing south or north. (3) Otherwise, in order to reduce friction between each other, negotiations will begin to resolve various outstanding issues, such as the withdrawal of expatriates, the freezing of funds, etc. Judging from the unusually solemn tone used by Churchill, it seems that the scope of these negotiations is far more than the resolution of outstanding issues, and the US Secretary of State Hull's statement also clearly indicates the broadness of the issues involved. But judging from the reactions of China, the US, and the Soviet Union to Churchill's speech, it does not seem that there is a strategy to fundamentally resolve the aggression of the East first. Because, given the current situation, if we want to fundamentally resolve the Eastern incident, we must resort to force; at the very least, countries such as the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union must separately engage in large-scale displays of force, and China's own large-scale counterattack is one of the most critical prerequisites. In short, before countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union launch a large-scale military action and diplomatic response, it seems that the simple diplomatic maneuvers of any one or two countries will never be able to force Japan to comply. So comparatively speaking, the second possible speculation mentioned above is more approximate. However, the content of these US-Japan negotiations is, after all, a concrete event, and before it is revealed, we can only wait for the answer of future facts with great attention and concern. What its content is will of course determine its outcome, and will further exert a very significant impact on the entire situation in the Far East and even the world.</p>
<p>In his speech, Churchill once again emphasized the UK and the US's unified awareness of the current world crisis, and made the greatest determination to move towards the path of thoroughly defeating the aggressive forces in the East and the West and building a new world ideal, regardless of everything. Indeed! We only need to take a comprehensive look at the various events that have occurred in Europe and Asia in the past two or three months, and we will feel very shocked both in terms of time and space. The opportunity for the forces of justice to turn danger into safety is truly a close call! Assuming that the United States had a trace of complacency, and did not pass the "Lend-Lease Act" in early spring this year, and resolutely announced its determination to thoroughly defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Soviet Union had a trace of fluke observation, and did not firmly refuse when Germany and Italy requested to pass through to attack the Near East, then, what the world situation would be today, of course, no one dares to say. Even on the British side, if Germany's peace offensive had not been stopped head-on early on when Hess flew to England, then the formation of the current anti-aggression front would have become a big question. Therefore, the formation of the anti-aggression front has reached the final time limit for realization in the first half of this year. In terms of space, the only land area that European aggressive violence has not yet broken through is the corner of Soviet Ukraine and Turkey. If Germany and Italy could pass through this area this spring and extend into the Near East, then undoubtedly, it would definitely be able to reach India and join hands with the violence lurking in the East, causing the forces of darkness to envelop the entire Eurasian continent. The separate defeat of the two groups of violence in the East and the West must be in the east of Thailand and the west of the Near East, which is also very obvious. Therefore, countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union, which first and foremost realized the urgency of time and the narrowness of space and resolutely formed a front against Eastern and Western violence, will certainly not have any actions of reversing the course and withdrawing their defenses today and in the future. Rumors of the revival of appeasement that have appeared in the past two days are of course groundless.</p>
<p>In fact, looking deeper, what the two powers in the East and the West are fantasizing and hoping to see today is not only the revival of appeasement. As Churchill said, the secret lies in carrying out individual strikes. For example, as far as Western aggressors are concerned, they fantasize that the UK and the US will sit idly by for a long time, so that they can attack the Soviet Union with all their strength. They also fantasize about dividing the UK and the US internally with a peace offensive. Even after occupying Ukraine, they still seem to have not given up the illusion of suddenly seeking a compromise with the Soviet Union and turning to attack the British Empire with all their strength. As for the Eastern violence, they fantasize about forcing appeasement from the UK and the US with a threatening posture, and exchanging the slogan of advancing north for blocking the Yunnan-Burma transportation and stopping aid to China. As for the Soviet Union, they dream of exchanging the Red Army's withdrawal from the Far East and the cessation of aid to China on the pretext of temporarily not responding to Germany and Italy. All of these things have already been completely shattered in front of the resolute statements and measures of the authorities of countries such as China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union, and are no longer worth mentioning. All the work of the forces of justice in the future lies in stepping up cooperation on their own side, accelerating the defeat of the aggressors, and working together to build a new world in the future. All the conspiracies, illusions, and rumors of the Eastern and Western violence only indicate that they are becoming increasingly desperate.</p>

<h3>Delegation to Burma to Depart Next Month</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the news of China's organization of a delegation to Burma was released, all parties in Burma have been excited and have sent letters and telegrams of welcome. It is heard that the Burmese side has established a reception committee and arranged a welcoming program. Yesterday, the Yangon Burma-China Cultural Association, the former Burmese delegation to China, the Yangon University Cheliu College, the Burma Journalists Association, the Burma Chamber of Commerce, the Women's Association, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Burma Pen Club, the Yangon Trade Association, the Indian Chamber of Commerce, the Burma Youth Association, and more than 30 other groups jointly sent a telegram expressing their warm welcome. In addition, Burmese officials have also informally expressed their welcome. It is heard that the delegation will depart at the beginning of next month. (Electric message on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Shaoguan Implements Wartime Economy, Not Affected by Embargo</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Although Japan and other countries have issued freeze orders and implemented embargoes on exports, Shaoguan, the capital of Guangdong Province, and other parts of Free Guangdong have not felt a significant impact. Local merchants generally believe this is because Guangdong Province has become self-sufficient. Guangdong Province is now implementing a wartime economy, and even further restrictions may not cause serious repercussions. In addition to blockading the coast, Japan has also imposed a land blockade. The Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway has been cut off at Danshui. The Japanese in the occupied areas have ordered a ban on communication with the free areas. Shaoguan's wartime economy is now being fully implemented. Although the cost of living has risen sharply, general importers and exporters and transportation companies are making many times more profit. Many students have also abandoned their studies to engage in business, with profits exceeding the income of university professors. The most affected are school teachers and salaried civil servants, but the provincial government has provided subsidies for relief. General theaters, restaurants, and entertainment venues are experiencing abnormal prosperity. The authorities are now planning to reduce the opening of tea rooms. Due to fear of air raids during the day, shops are not open for business, so they are ten times more profitable at night. (26th International News Agency)</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sets Prices to Purchase Foreign Exchange Drafts, Hong Kong Removes Remittance Limits</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that the Central Bank is prepared to purchase foreign exchange and drafts from foreigners and Chinese in China.

<h3>Soviet Troops Cross Iranian Border, Advance Over Forty Kilometers; British Troops Land in Persian Gulf to Protect Iranian Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Moscow, 26th TASS – According to a telegram from Tbilisi, in accordance with Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1921, Soviet troops have been ordered to enter Iran. On the morning of the 25th, our troops crossed the border and advanced 40 kilometers in the areas of Atbir and Toris. The advance of Soviet troops is continuing.</p>
<p>London, 26th Reuters – According to responsible sources here, British troops encountered some resistance in Iran. A communique was issued by Simora this morning regarding British military operations in Iran, stating that General Wavell's forces have occupied the Naftishah oil station and the small town of Khosravi. British troops did not encounter serious resistance, and the Iranian people showed no signs of hostility. Troops transported by British aircraft have taken steps to protect the families of British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Iranian oil fields are located in the southwest of the country, with pipelines leading to Baghdad. British troops are currently advancing from various locations in Iraq, and more troops are continuing to land by sea at Bandar Shahpur in the Persian Gulf. In northern Iran, Soviet troops have crossed the border from at least two points in the Caucasus, and are now advancing towards Tabriz and Ardebil. It is reported that late last night, Soviet troops had penetrated 25 miles and were continuing to advance. Tabriz is 60 miles from the Soviet border, with a population of over 200,000, and is the second-largest city outside of Tehran. Ardebil is close to the Caspian Sea, and its surrounding area is not large. Another Soviet force is now advancing from the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, encircling Achaibakin in northeastern Iran. British aircraft have scattered leaflets over the Iranian capital, explaining the reasons for the British action and stating that Britain has no quarrel with the Iranian people and has no designs on Iran's independence and territory. As for whether British and Soviet forces intend to converge, it is not yet known, but it seems unlikely to happen in the near future. Currently, British and Soviet forces will each occupy a region.</p>
<p>London, 26th Reuters – The German official news agency reported that British troops are advancing into Iran from Iraq in three directions. One route starts from Rawanduz and Rawat (100 miles northeast of Mosul), with the aim of meeting Soviet troops at Achaibakin. The central route is currently advancing from Kanikin towards Khosravi (100 miles northeast of Baghdad). The southern route's area of activity is in the Persian Gulf area near Bandar Shahpur and the Abadan oil region. The Soviet advance is towards Ardebil (25 miles west of the Caspian Sea) and Tabriz.</p>
<p>Iranian Troops Poorly Equipped, No Match for Anglo-Soviet Allied Forces</p>
<p>Cairo, 26th Reuters – Near Eastern countries were comforted by the news of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, as it was known that Iran was a weak point in the large front line extending from West Africa to Singapore. It is not yet known whether the Iranian army will resist, but even if there is resistance, it will not be as extensive as in Syria. The Iranian army has about 19 divisions, which are said to be well-trained but lack modern equipment. It is rumored that its air force has only ten modern aircraft, and the number of German-made tanks it possesses is very small. Germany may now send troops by air to assist, but since the Soviet Union is cooperating with Britain, Germany will find it difficult to transport troops by air. British and Soviet troops can quickly establish contact by advancing from Iraq. This is the first step in establishing a front line from Murmansk south to the Near East. People in Cairo are increasingly anxious as the joint Anglo-Soviet war in Iran gradually unfolds. The Egyptian princess is the wife of the Iranian crown prince, but apart from this, the cultural relationship between the two countries is not significant, because although Egypt and Iran are both Islamic countries, they belong to different sects. Non-official observers believe that the Iranian war will take two forms: (1) the shortest route for British and Soviet forces to meet; (2) a rapid advance north from Bairah in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Turkey Offers Guarantees to Britain and the Soviet Union, Resolves to Strictly Maintain Neutrality</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th United Press – The British and Soviet ambassadors here formally assured Turkey yesterday that neither Britain nor the Soviet Union has any permanent political or territorial ambitions towards Iran. This assurance was given to Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu, who in turn assured the British and Soviet ambassadors that Turkey would continue to maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th Huitong News Agency – The Iranian ambassador to Turkey, Kazemi, visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu yesterday morning to inform him of the Soviet invasion of Iran. British Ambassador Hugessen also visited the Turkish Foreign Ministry yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th Reuters – Although Britain and the United States have fully informed Turkey of all developments regarding Iran, the news of the troops crossing the border still caused considerable surprise, as it was unexpected to happen so quickly. There has been no official Turkish reaction yet, but it is generally believed that if war breaks out, Turkey will declare that it will remain neutral. The Turkish people are not concerned about Britain's actions, but they cannot be said to welcome the Soviet Union's actions. However, the Soviet Union's declaration that it will withdraw its troops as soon as possible has indeed eased possible anxieties.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 25th Havas News Agency – It is generally expected here that Turkey will declare neutrality regarding the Iranian war. Regarding this matter, Moscow Radio today published the secret clauses of Article 6 of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty, which stipulates that the Soviet Union may occupy Iranian territory when necessary. The Sadabad Pact signed by Turkey and Iran is actually in conflict with this. Turkey may not be bound by the treaty.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th Havas News Agency – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the invasion of Iran by British and Soviet troops will cause serious repercussions in the Middle East. The main issue that urgently needs to be resolved is Turkey's attitude, as the country is now located in the center of the war and has signed treaties of friendship with Britain, Germany, and Iran, so its responsibility is extremely important. However, according to the Iranian-Turkish treaty, it does not include military clauses, so Turkey should be able to maintain neutrality in the Iranian war.</p>
<p>Britain Occupies Two Iranian Oil Regions, Encounters No Significant Resistance</p>
<p>Simla, India, 26th Havas World Telegraph Agency – The British military headquarters here issued a battle report stating that the oil regions of Naftishah and Galikeshirin in Iran have been occupied by our troops and encountered no significant resistance. The residents also showed no hostility towards British troops, and due to our rapid operations, the losses of the Iranian military were reduced to the minimum extent to avoid loss of life. In addition, we also used aircraft to transport troops to other oil regions to protect the families of British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 26th Havas News Agency – After the Anglo-Soviet allied forces entered Iran, the authorities here recently took emergency precautionary measures on the European part of the Turkish border. Since the 25th, people who do not hold special permits issued by the military authorities are not allowed to pass. Yesterday, many travelers on the Turkish-Bulgarian border were forced to return because they did not carry permits.</p>
<p>US Political Circles Attach Great Importance to British and Soviet Occupation of the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>Washington, 26th United Press – Political circles stated yesterday that if Britain and the Soviet Union use Iran as a supply route to the Soviet Union, the United States will play an important role in the Soviet defense. It was also stated that Iran is the most convenient and best route to transport supplies to the Soviet Union to maintain the Soviet resistance, especially its Baku oil fields north of Iran. It was also stated that the US fleet will undoubtedly play a historic role in this work, as the US will protect its supply lines in the Persian Gulf while continuing its protection responsibilities in the Pacific. It was also stated that Iran is the best and most likely outcome to see how the US can simultaneously assist Britain and the Soviet Union without having to withdraw its fleet from the Pacific. Observers believe that Churchill's promise to provide military assistance to the US in the event of war with Japan indicates that the US will protect its supply ships passing through the Pacific. Churchill said that there is no obstacle to the aid already promised to the Soviet Union, which clearly refers to Iran or Japan.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th United Press – The "Forum" newspaper published a telegram from Ankara yesterday stating that 15 Soviet divisions are concentrated on the Turkish border and estimating that 30 Soviet divisions have entered Iran.</p>

<h3>Japan Permits US Officials to Leave for Shanghai, Philippines Declares No Obstacles for Transit of Japanese Nationals</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th Reuters – It is reported that 13 or 14 US government personnel, including about 10 from the Soviet Union, are scheduled to take a train to Kobe this morning in order to board the "Tatsuta Maru" for Shanghai on Thursday. Most of those who had originally purchased tickets for the "Nitta Maru" to the United States will also change to the "Tatsuta Maru". It is reported that there are also some newly arrived people in Japan, whose number is unknown, who are also eager to obtain cabin space on this ship. It is believed that there are 10 British nationals among them.</p>
<p>Manila, 26th Reuters – It is denied here that the 200 Japanese women and children who went to Shanghai yesterday aboard the "Southern Star" were subjected to strict restrictions, as reported by Tokyo. In fact, their luggage was inspected and sent out on the ship without any obstacles. According to the freeze order, the cash and securities they carry must not exceed the prescribed amount. A spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner stated that the Japanese claim that Japanese nationals leaving the country encountered serious difficulties is an exaggeration. Luggage is inspected in accordance with regulations, but the inspection procedures are very fair and there is no undressing or anything like that. The seized cash and securities will be kept in custody and returned if no war breaks out. It is true that some cash and securities were confiscated on the ship, but the amount has not been announced. The Japanese Consul-General visited the customs authorities regarding the arrest of 17 Japanese for illegally fishing in Manila Bay. The customs authorities informed him that the arrested persons did not have consular licenses. Japanese merchants holding long-term leases in Davao, the main hemp-producing area, have requested an extension of the lease as the deadline is approaching, but the Philippine government's policy is to nationalize natural resources, so their request may not be granted.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Soviet Note to Iran</h3>
<p>Moscow (TASS), 26th – On the 25th, Molotov, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, under the instructions of the Soviet government, sent the following note to Mohammad Seyed, the Iranian Ambassador Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union: "The Soviet government, in view of the friendly sentiments of the Soviet Union towards the Iranian people, and in order to respect Iranian sovereignty, has always adopted a policy of strengthening friendly relations between the two countries.  The friendly policy between the Soviet Union and Iran can be confirmed by the notes sent by the Soviet government to Iran on January 14, 1918, and June 26, 1919. These notes describe the principles of the Soviet Union's policy towards Iran and the details of the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and Iran.  The unchangeable principle of all agreements between the Soviet Union and Iran is to respect the independence and territorial integrity of Iran.</p>
<p>Soviet Assistance to Iran's Revival</p>
<p>Based on this principle, the Soviet government, in its note of January 14, 1918, declared the abolition of all agreements that affected the rights of the Iranian people to freedom and independent existence. The Soviet government abolished the funds that Iran should have paid to the Tsarist Russian government and stopped infringing on Iran's tax revenues. At the same time, the Soviet government also abandoned the consular jurisdiction that harmed Iran's national sovereignty (Russians could not be judged by Iranian courts based on this right). Afterwards, the Soviet government immediately returned some enterprises to the Iranian people (including railways, telegraph lines, and postal services). In addition, the Discount Bank and its assets were also returned to Iran. The actions of the Soviet government on January 14, 1918, and June 26, 1919, proved the government's will to assist Iran in achieving political and economic prosperity. In the Soviet-Iranian Agreement of February 26, 1921, the Soviet government declared the abolition of agreements signed between Iran and the Tsarist Russian government that hindered Iranian sovereignty, and implemented the cessation of the use of Ashurada and other islands near the coast of the Iranian province of Astara. At the same time, the Soviet government announced the abandonment of all rights to the loans lent by Tsarist Russia to Iran, because these loans were aimed at enslaving Iran. As for the Iranian tax revenue used as collateral for the loan, the Soviet Union also announced its abandonment. In addition to returning the enterprises listed in the 1919 note to Iran, the Soviet government also transferred the Sofia Island Mian Lake railway vehicles and the boats in Mian Lake to Iran. In the following years, the Soviet government continued to provide assistance in economic development, such as the trade agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Iran on July 3, 1924, which granted Iran special rights in terms of import and export. In addition, the 1926 Water Supply Agreement, the 1927 Fisheries Agreement, the 1935 Agricultural Agreement, the 1936 Agreement on the Elimination of Locusts, the 1940 Trade Agreement, and all of its treaties are clear evidence of the Soviet Union's friendship with Iran. As a result of Soviet assistance to Iran, Iran has established large-scale sectors in the national economy (such as fisheries and cotton industry). Recently, the Soviet Union has taken further steps to strengthen and develop its economic relations with Iran. The Soviet Union has agreed to transport extremely important goods to Iran.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Has the Right to Send Troops into Iran</p>
<p>Even at the time of the conclusion of the main agreement on February 26, 1921, both the Soviet Union and Iran were aware of the difficulties that would be encountered in the process of strengthening friendly relations between the two countries, and believed that anti-Soviet and anti-Iranian elements would use Iran as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. In order to eliminate this crisis, Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Agreement stated the following: "The contracting parties agree that in any of the following circumstances, the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic Federation shall have the right to send troops into the interior of Persia to carry out military operations, but after the crisis is eliminated, the Soviet government shall immediately withdraw its troops: (1) If a third party attempts to implement a policy of armed intervention in Persia; (2) If a third power attempts to use Persian soil to wage war against the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic Federation; (3) If a certain power threatens the border of Soviet Russia or its common allies, and the Persian government is still unable to eliminate this threat after Soviet Russia has issued a warning." From this point of view, the Iranian government has agreed that the Soviet government can take action to protect Soviet interests in Iran after the crisis described in the 1921 treaty occurs. At the same time, it has also been guaranteed that Soviet troops will withdraw from Iran after the crisis is eliminated. In the twenty years since the implementation of the 1921 agreement, the Soviet Union has never considered it necessary to invoke Article 6 of the agreement.</p>
<p>Nazi Conspiracies Threaten the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Although, recently (after the attack on the Soviet Union), the Nazi German conspiracies in Iran have further expanded, posing a major threat to the Soviet Union. German personnel occupy important positions in 50 parts of the Iranian government, attempting to disrupt Iran and involve Iran in the vortex of war against the Soviet Union. Nazi elements such as Radanovics, Hammoto, Meier Wilhelm, and Sapp, under the guise of serving in various German commercial firms, have organized terrorist groups, attempting to infiltrate Soviet Azerbaijan, the Soviet oil region of Baku, and the Turkmen Soviet Republic. On the other hand, they are plotting to launch an offensive in Iran. The recent arrival of the leader of the German secret agents in Iran is extremely active and is related to this matter. The leaders of the German secret agents, namely Hammoto and Meier, under the guidance of the German embassy, have formed military teams in German Hanley, preparing to move to Baku and other important Soviet border points at several points on the Iranian border, with the aim of setting fires and blowing up important buildings within the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Activities of Germans in Iran</p>
<p>Throughout Iran, German personnel can be found supplying arms everywhere. Near Mianeh in northern Iran, they have stored 50 tons of explosives. Around German Hanley, they are conducting military exercises under the pretext of hunting. In addition, 56 German secret agents have infiltrated Iranian military factories, including the famous German spy Attle, who is stationed in the German commercial firm Klapproth, Radovi區, the host of Siemens, Quinn, and Wallf, the leader of German secret agents on the coast of North Erie Sea. The criminal activities of German personnel have undermined the principle of respecting Iran's territorial integrity and have turned Iranian soil into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, Iran is full of crises. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to immediately take various measures to defend itself in accordance with Article 6 of the 1921 agreement.</p>
<p>Britain and the Soviet Union Jointly Warn Iran</p>
<p>Since the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has three times (June 26, July 19, and August 16 of this year) asked the Iranian government to pay attention to the crisis caused by the activities of German personnel in Iran. On June 26, the Soviet government notified Iran that the Soviet government had obtained reliable information that German personnel in Iran were indeed plotting a coup. On July 19, the Soviet Union, together with Britain, once again asked the Iranian government to eliminate the activities of German personnel that could endanger the interests of Iran itself and its neighbors, and urged Iran to expel German personnel from the country, because the presence of German personnel in Iran posed a great threat to Soviet interests. Finally, on August 16, the Soviet and British governments urged the Iranian government for the third time to pay attention to this issue, demanding that it stop the activities of German personnel against Iran itself and Soviet and British interests, and expel German personnel from the country.</p>
<p>Iran Ignores the Soviet Union, So the Soviet Union Takes This Action</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet Union has issued warnings to Iran three times, but Iran has refused to take steps. This attitude is tantamount to encouraging German personnel to step up their activities. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to send troops into Iran to defend itself in accordance with Article 6 of the 1921 agreement. This step is by no means aimed at the Iranian people. The Soviet government has no intention of undermining Iran's independence and territorial integrity. The military measures taken by the Soviet government are purely aimed at the crisis caused by the anti-Soviet activities of German personnel. Once this crisis is eliminated, the Soviet government will immediately fulfill its obligations under the 1921 Soviet-Iranian agreement and withdraw Soviet troops from Iranian territory.</p>

<h3>Soviet War Report Announces Withdrawal from Novgorod, Fierce Fighting on the Banks of the Dnieper River Continues, German Offensive Against Leningrad Blocked</h3>
<p>Moscow (TASS), 26th – The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report on the night of the 25th, stating that on the 25th, our army fought strongly on all fronts. After fierce fighting, our troops withdrew from Novgorod. On the 25th, 46 enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat and on airfields. We lost 6 planes. Our Black Sea warships sank a German submarine.</p>
<p>Moscow (TASS), 26th – The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that on the night of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, our army continued to fight fiercely with the enemy in the directions of Kexholm, Novgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk (west bank of the Dnieper River).</p>
<p>Leningrad (TASS), 26th – The Red Army is preventing the fascist bandits from advancing towards Leningrad with unprecedented courage. Hitler's troops continue to reinforce the area despite heavy losses, but they will never be able to break the determination of the people of Leningrad to defend their territory. Since the outbreak of the war, the people of Leningrad have been organizing a national army. Workers, artists, students, and writers have all received military training. Since Voroshilov issued an appeal to the people, the people of Leningrad have immediately armed themselves, vowing to defend their territory to the last drop of blood and crush the enemy. They are now fighting side by side with the Red Army. During the day, Leningrad is as usual. All shops are open as usual, and cinemas are also full. However, the enemy's threat has not been eliminated. The National Army is constantly moving to the front lines. At midnight, there is no one on the streets, only the sound of sentries' footsteps. The great fighting city and the city loved by the Soviet people have mobilized all their manpower to help the Red Army fight. Near Leningrad, the enemy will dig its own grave.</p>
<p>London (Reuters), 26th – The German offensive in the Leningrad area has made no further progress. It is not yet clear whether the German advance from Novgorod is aimed at capturing Leningrad or cutting off the important Leningrad-Moscow railway. The German troops advancing towards Leningrad from Estonia are now said to have approached Tallinn. It is expected that the Soviet army will be able to hold the city, as it is an important base for the Soviet Navy's activities in the Baltic Sea. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow claimed that if the rainfall on the front lines in the past 24 hours continues, it will have a great impact on the German army's actions. Most of the roads are now muddy. Nazi tanks will inevitably experience difficulties in western Leningrad and Ukraine. In Ukraine, the German army is now trying to occupy the entire right bank of the Dnieper River. The Soviet army is now fighting hard. There is no new news about the Battle of Odessa. Soviet propaganda claims that the navy has won another victory and has sunk a German submarine.</p>
<p>British and Soviet Troops Will Meet in the Caucasus to Open Up Transportation and Supply Lines</p>
<p>London (Reuters), 26th – London has not yet received confirmation that the German army has built a bridgehead on the Dnieper River. Therefore, the focus of the war is still west of the Dnieper River. According to current observations, the Dnieper and Petrovsk sluices have been blown up, but the Soviet government has not issued a formal statement on the destruction of the sluices. The fighting on the Leningrad front is still fierce, but there are no significant changes. Soviet troops in the Smolensk and Gomel regions are launching counter-offensives, but London has not received detailed reports of the counter-offensives. Both Soviet and German communiqués are extremely simple and do not mention any new developments in the Eastern Front. The Soviet communiqué stated that there was fierce fighting in Kexholm, Novgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk. The German communiqué stated that the war was proceeding satisfactorily according to plan. From this, it can be seen that there is nothing special to report and no progress has been made in the Leningrad area. Independent sources report that General Timoshenko's troops are launching a strong counter-offensive to relieve the pressure on the Dnieper River bend from the German army. The industrial center of the bend, Dnepropetrovsk, has been mentioned for the first time in the Soviet communiqué. However, there is no news that the German army has gained a foothold on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The German side has even admitted that the bridgehead built by the Soviet army is under attack, indicating that General Budyonny is still in control of the river. The Soviet garrison in Odessa is causing the German side to feel quite uneasy. The most important development is in the Caucasus region. British and Soviet troops are expected to meet in the area soon to open up this route for the transportation of military supplies and the deployment of reinforcements when necessary. This move will have a significant impact on the outcome of the war in southern Soviet Union, and the possibility of the British Air Force providing early cooperation should not be overlooked.</p>

<h3>Today Celebrates Confucius' Birthday, The Third National Teachers' Day is Held Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Guanghua News Agency) Today is the birthday of the most sage teacher Confucius, and it is also the third National Teachers' Day. All levels of schools in the city, in accordance with academic qualifications, are closed for one day and fly flags to celebrate. However, due to the special environment, no ceremony will be held. Only the schools will individually elaborate on Confucius's theories and virtues as a model. As the victory against Japan and national reconstruction is getting closer and closer, all teachers in the city are spirited and follow the instructions of the President in each and every aspect, work hard in their respective positions, and implement education to save the country.</p>
<p>(Chongqing, 26th) The Confucius' Birthday Memorial Day has been designated as Teachers' Day. This is the third session. Chen Jiao, the Minister of Education, issued a letter to teachers of all levels of schools across the country.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Measures for the Issue of Students from War Zones</h3>
<p>Issuance of borrowing certificates and transfer certificates (Chongqing Airmail) In order to provide relief to students of all levels of schools withdrawing from the war zones, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated measures for the transfer and borrowing of students from all levels of schools in the war zones and announced their implementation. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 General Principles</p>
<p>1. These measures are formulated in accordance with Items A-2, B-3 and C-1 of the Outline of Measures for the Handling of Students of All Levels of Schools Withdrawing from War Zones issued by the Ministry of Education. 2. The students of all levels of schools withdrawing from the war zones referred to in these measures are limited to those who are currently studying in public and established private schools.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Borrowing Certificates and Transfer Certificates</p>
<p>3. All levels of schools in the war zone that are temporarily closed shall issue students with borrowing certificates or transfer certificates. These certificates must state the student's name, gender, age, place of origin, department, and grade (the transfer certificates of junior colleges must include the student's transcripts for each subject in each academic year) so that the student can borrow or transfer. 4. Junior high schools or elementary schools in the war zone, even if they are not closed, may issue borrowing certificates and transfer certificates at the request of the student's parents. 5. If secondary schools and above in the war zone that have been closed have not been able to issue borrowing certificates or transfer certificates to students due to special reasons, the original students may register with the education departments of each province and city with sufficient supporting documents and apply for the issuance of a borrowing introduction letter. After review and approval, the registration office will issue it. 6. If there are any cases of deception or abuse in the issuance of various certificates and supporting documents, in addition to expelling the student from school, the responsible personnel will be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Borrowing and Transfer Procedures</p>
<p>7. Students of secondary schools and above who hold a borrowing certificate or transfer certificate may, in addition to the borrowing or transfer schools already designated by the original school, request to borrow or transfer to an equivalent school on their own convenience. Those who request to transfer must pass the entrance examination. The recognition of credits for transfer students in junior colleges and above shall be determined separately in accordance with the school's curriculum. 8. Elementary school students of all grades who have not obtained a certificate of study or a transfer certificate from the original school may use the transcript of the most recent semester of the original school as proof of borrowing and transfer. Those who do not have a transcript from the original school may use a test to determine their class. 9. Students of secondary schools and above who are unable to find a borrowing school may request the registration office of the Ministry of Education and the education departments of each province and city to designate a borrowing school. 10. Transfer and borrowing are not limited to grades, but must be enrolled at the beginning of the academic year or semester.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Treatment of Borrowing Students</p>
<p>11. Borrowing students shall abide by all regulations of the borrowing school and be subject to all examinations of the borrowing school. 12. The tuition and other fees to be paid by borrowing students shall be in accordance with the regulations of the borrowing school, but shall be determined by the school proportionally based on the length of the borrowing period. 13. If a borrowing student or transfer student is in extreme economic difficulty because their family is trapped in the war zone or has escaped from the war zone, junior college students and above may handle it in accordance with the loan measures promulgated by the Ministry. Elementary and secondary school students may request the borrowing school to waive or reduce various fees. 14. Each school shall treat borrowing students equally with its own students. Borrowing students who pass the semester or academic year examination may, according to the borrowing student's wishes, issue a certificate of borrowing performance or consider them to be students transferring to this school.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Measures for All Levels of Schools to Accept Borrowing Students</p>
<p>15. Public schools shall accept borrowing students as much as possible. Private schools shall be assessed by the competent educational administrative authorities for their performance, all equipment, and whether the school environment is relatively safe. After being designated, they shall accept students in accordance with the prescribed number of admissions. 16. If the enrollment of public schools and designated private schools at all levels is full, or the classrooms cannot accommodate them, they shall consider renting houses near the school or building temporary houses to serve as classrooms and dormitories. If the experimental equipment is insufficient, it shall be divided into groups for rotation experiments. 17. The expenses incurred by public and private schools due to the acceptance of a large number of borrowing students may be reported by each school, stating the number of borrowing students and the amount of funding required, and submitted to the competent educational administrative authorities for approval and appropriate subsidies. 18. The classes opened by public and private schools due to the acceptance of borrowing students may be requested by each school to the competent educational administrative authorities to select and employ teachers withdrawing from the war zones to serve. 19. Borrowing students may be assigned by inserting them into classes or opening special classes separately. 20. If borrowing students cannot enroll at the beginning of the academic year or semester due to special reasons, the borrowing school may consider accepting them during the term. 21. Schools at all levels shall not refuse to accept borrowing students without reason. If there is a refusal on the pretext, the competent educational administrative authority shall impose an appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Supplementary Provisions</p>
<p>22. After these measures are promulgated, the previous laws and regulations issued by the Ministry relating to borrowing measures shall not apply temporarily. 23. If there are any matters not covered by these measures, the Ministry of Education shall amend them at any time. 24. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: The Unpredictable Changes in the Current Situation Make Cotton Yarn Speculation Difficult; The Market's Sudden Rise and Fall Shows Its Anxiety</h3>
<p>The recent yarn market has been rising and falling suddenly. This state is entirely caused by the anxiety of speculators on both the long and short sides. Currently, there are two arguments in the market. The bulls say that the current yarn inventory is shrinking day by day, and the cost of the factory is increasing without decreasing. The price of 32-count single yarn is firm and unchanged, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is also rising. The foundation of the yarn market should be consolidated. However, the sellers say that the peak has been seen, the international situation is still turbulent, and they tend to sell and grab hats. If this is the case, the market price will be erratic. The actual sales of customers are not as strong as the previous day. Because the market has seen a reversal, they are also temporarily watching. Because the 32-count yarn is as hard as ever, but the miscellaneous brand yarn was too strong yesterday, it has also fallen by dozens of yuan. Today, 805 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,709 yuan, and the low price was 1,683.4 yuan. In the afternoon, because people's minds were mostly bearish, the market continued to soften. The opening price was 1,687 yuan, and it fell to 82 yuan. Then it was heard that the yarn and cloth at the exchange was not offered by the dealers, and the shorts again robbed and patched up, and the price rose by 20 to 30 yuan. The cloth rose by 7 to 8 jiao to 1.05 yuan. Double Horse rose to 1,711 yuan, and the closing price was 1,710 yuan, higher than the morning high. From a fundamental point of view, the yarn market should be stable, but speculators buy more as prices rise and sell as prices fall, making the market turbulent.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the exchange market fell after the previous day, people's minds were relaxed. The opening price was 1,690 yuan, and it fell to 86 yuan shortly after. Then it was heard that the futures market at the exchange rebounded, and the yarn market rebounded, rising to 1,707 yuan. Unexpectedly, the cloth price fell back, and the shorts used the peace atmosphere to put pressure again. The situation was mediocre, and the price fell to 1,680 yuan. At the same time, the same industry who bought a huge amount on the previous day suddenly released a large portion of their files because they had eaten too many amounts. The market fell step by step to 1,687 yuan. After the closing, it was made to 1,682.3 yuan. The statistics of the turnover in half a day were 8,870 bales. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 370 Fellow Traders 8,500</p>
<p>Statistics 8,870</p>
<p>The futures market situation of Jin Double Horse is extremely uneven in the turbulent atmosphere. Rumors are frequently spread by all parties, and it is impossible to determine whether it is bullish or bearish, which makes people uneasy and unable to rely on. Therefore, sellers throw out at high prices, and those who see low prices and pull up are also not few. Therefore, the market price rises and falls suddenly, and ultimately rises. When the market opened in the morning, the US cotton fell again, and the factory orders were very weak, so the futures yarn was affected, and people's minds mostly turned downward. The selling of floating longs and shorts was especially crowded for a while. The opening of the September issue was 593 yuan, a drop of 7 yuan, and the October issue was 625 yuan, a small reduction of 3 yuan. After entering, it recovered slightly because the bulls bought at low prices. Later, it was blocked by bad news, and those who took off their hands sold hard and sold a lot along with the decline of the factory orders. The market price suddenly turned soft again. The noon closing price was 1,610.5 yuan for the recent period, 1,627 yuan for the October issue, and 1,646 yuan for the November issue, with varying differences. The turnover in the previous market was 13,450 bales. In the afternoon, the market situation gradually rose with the firmness of the factory orders, and the footing seemed to be more stable. Moreover, the floating longs insisted on pulling up, and the exchange also saw a rebound, so the yarn price was firm. Except for the near term, which was flat alone, the far term rose by 12 yuan to 19 yuan. As a result, the September issue was 1,610 yuan, the October issue was 1,640.5 yuan, and the November issue was 1,664 yuan. Today is the birthday of Confucius, and the market is closed for one day. Looking at the trend, its footing seems to be quite fluctuating. The development of foreign countries and other unfavorable factors are the most obvious taboo for buyers. Therefore, those engaged in the industry should consider selling at high prices when they see high prices. The total turnover for the day was 23,530 bales, a decrease of 13,830 bales compared with the previous day. As of the 25th, the number of three-month deposit accounts was 23,490 bales, of which 7,580 bales were deposited in the September issue, 10,170 bales were deposited in the October issue, and 5,740 bales were deposited in the November issue. The opening and closing high and low prices for one day are recorded on the left (the net market price).</p>
<p>Opening Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September 1,593.00 1,610.00 1,590.00 1,610.00 Unchanged</p>
<p>October 1,625.00 1,693.00 1,619.00 1,640.50 Up 12.50</p>
<p>November 1,657.00 1,666.00 1,643.00 1,664.00 Up 19.00</p>
<h3>There Are Two Benefits to Ordering American Cotton; Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Still Lively</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is still lively. All parties are undoubtedly interested in importing Brazilian cotton because they can obtain standard foreign exchange and a large number of tonnage, and they are making persistent efforts. At present, whether it is American, Indian, or Brazilian cotton, if the spot goods arrive in Shanghai in September and October, they have already been bought by various chemical companies and a few factories. Therefore, the work of foreign cotton merchants and foreign firms is to work hard to set up American ships or neutral country ships to facilitate the continued purchase of Chinese and foreign yarn factories. Yesterday, the turnover of American cotton was rare, and Brazilian cotton was still close to more than 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to President Roosevelt's rejection of the Smith Act, which affected the continuous settlement of the public and unfavorable spot trade, but then slightly rebounded due to a part of the shorts covering their positions. As a result, the closing price was 2 to 3 pounds lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to speculators buying in and shorts covering their positions, and then fell due to longs taking profits, but finally rose due to shorts covering their positions and brokers buying in. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be quite flat, with little difference from the closing price.</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation was flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, because the yarn market was tight, coarse velvet cotton was especially popular. This is because cotton merchants are in high spirits. Therefore, although the turnover is not smooth, there is no shortage of ships sailing overseas in September and October, and it is difficult for people to expect prices to rise excessively.</p>

The Anqing wheel of Taikoo Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, carrying 18,195 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. The Jiangsu wheel also arrived in port in the afternoon the day before yesterday, carrying 8,510 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign rice market yesterday saw a flat market in the early morning. Later, the rumor of a US-Japan compromise was unfavorable to the bulls, and the general big players were shocked. Chinese and foreign merchants continued to sell in the market. Although the importers were afraid of the sharp decline of the British and Chinese companies, they did not dare to order. However, since there is a large inventory in the market, and the goods on the way continue to arrive in Shanghai, the street lacks a smooth stomach, and customers have no need for it. Speculative transactions such as the leather ball gang dare not ask. The buying interest in the market is silent, and the selling sound is noisy. The current rice price has repeatedly gone down in the devaluation of floating households. Yinghua Si has a new arrival relationship, Dongzhan may be blocked, and they are willing to reduce prices to get rid of them. The closing price saw a huge drop of 3 to 4 yuan. If No. 1 Saigon has only opened at 128 yuan, No. 2 Siam is 114 yuan to 111.5 yuan, Min Dangbai is 130 yuan, ordinary is 124 yuan, Jue is 119 yuan to 117 yuan, Xiaojiao Bank Zhan is 115 yuan, Wai Zhan is 114 yuan, Tokyo Po is 106 yuan, and Broken Jian is 90 yuan to 86 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also has a sluggish way out in this environment, and the situation is also tired. Fortunately, there is not much stock in the market, and the selling price has not changed much, only slightly softer and closer to Yun. The opening price of Hong Kong Gao Baiyuan was 129 yuan, and the final price was 124 yuan. The glutinous tea was 116 yuan and the final price was 111 yuan. The domestic glutinous rice is still in short supply and there is no market.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica domestic rice is completely different from foreign rice. It depends on the smooth source of domestic sources and our transfer. Therefore, although foreign rice fell sharply again yesterday, Duyou japonica rice was extremely tight due to the arrival of few goods. The selling price continued to be high at 1 or 2 yuan. The opening price of Nangang early rice was 153.5 yuan and 153 yuan, Wuxi original package special japonica rice was 155 yuan, the market was 150 yuan, and the final price was 145.6 yuan. Pudong new japonica rice has no market due to the interruption of the source. Attached notice: Today is Confucius' birthday, and the market will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Slightly Move, Flour Market Slightly Better</h3>

<p>Flour: The spot flour market yesterday was tired and then stable. In the morning opening, in the rumor of selling profits and the falling rice price, people's minds were all in vain, and retail investors gradually sold, and the market was quite loose. Jinlong flour opened at only 31 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, but in the middle of the street, actual sales moved slightly, and some capacity-holders took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and the situation stabilized. Jinlong flour Puxi Zhan returned to 32 yuan and 1 jiao, and Pudong Zhan was 32 yuan, 4 jiao to 4 jiao and a half. According to the current Puxi Zhan, the flour in stock has been for a long time and the quality is second, so the selling price is cheaper than Pudong Zhan. There are still Pao Tai flour at 33 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 4 jiao, and banana flour at 33 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, which are about half a yuan lower than before. The turnover was more than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The purchase volume of each factory is small, because the goods from the near suburbs are scarce and difficult to buy. The purchase price of each factory has also changed little. It is heard that the purchase price of Japanese factories is 45 yuan, and the Chinese factories are still 48.9 yuan.</p>

<h3>Quiet Futures Market, Thriving Spot Market: Initial Dip Followed by a Significant Rebound of Seventy Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market saw heated and volatile trading. Spot prices initially fell before rebounding, while futures continued their downward trend, primarily due to the HSBC's small counter settling the US dollar exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan, pressuring the market at 6,555 yuan. There was increased closing of positions, with sellers eager to liquidate. However, with over thirty days remaining until the September contract's expiry, potential exchange rate fluctuations made it difficult to defend. Consequently, the 6,700 yuan level triggered buying by those with short positions, pushing the price back up to 6,740 yuan before retreating again. The market closed down eleven yuan, with light trading overall. Cash transactions were comparatively active, as many participants on the futures exchange also engaged in spot trading. The market opened in the morning continuing the previous day's weak momentum, falling by 150 yuan. Yee Foong, Chin Cheng Kee, and Cheung Wo sold 200 taels each, with Cheung Wo selling an additional 50 taels from Tian Yuan, all at 9,150 yuan.

At noon, the price rose to 9,300 yuan. Tai Kang Run later resold 30 taels to a certain silver shop at 9,280 yuan. In the afternoon, Chin Cheng Kee sold 20 taels and Yung Foong Yue sold 10 taels, all bought by Cheung Hing Yung, at 9,280 yuan. Afterwards, there were fewer sellers, resulting in Yee Foong Chin selling ten taels to Fook Hong Yung at 9,350 yuan. Finally, with limited sellers, the price reached 9,370 yuan, a rebound of seventy yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was up ten yuan, calculated at 960 yuan.

<h3>Stabilization Fund to Convene in Hong Kong; Two Experts Summoned; Prepared to Depart, Travel Date Uncertain; Shanghai Exchange Rate Management Plan Imminent</h3>
<p>Dr. Taylor, the American expert dispatched by the Exchange Stabilization Fund and stationed in Shanghai for half a month, and Mr. Hall-Patch, the British member who recently arrived in Shanghai to investigate the true situation of the foreign exchange market, suddenly received an urgent telegram from the Hong Kong temporary office of the Exchange Stabilization Fund yesterday morning, urging them to depart for Hong Kong immediately. They are to attend a joint meeting with Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, as well as the Chinese member, Mr. Xi Demao, and the American member, Mr. Fox, who recently flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing, to finalize and approve the issue of foreign exchange management in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Both Have Prepared to Depart for Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the Exchange Stabilization Fund announced that it would supply foreign exchange for essential goods at the new price starting August 18, Dr. Taylor, stationed in Shanghai, has been discussing the basic principles of foreign exchange settlement with relevant banks in Shanghai for days. Furthermore, with the dispatch of British member Mr. Hall-Patch to Shanghai to participate in the meeting, an implementation plan has been formulated. This plan stipulates that the Hong Kong Exchange Stabilization Fund will implement the plan centrally, but the plan is subject to approval. Therefore, it is necessary for the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to hold a full meeting. Taylor and Hall-Patch will give a detailed report on the situation of the Shanghai foreign exchange market and submit the plan drafted in Shanghai for discussion and final decision. According to sources at the Metropole Hotel and the British Embassy, Taylor and Hall-Patch remained in Shanghai yesterday, but they are indeed prepared to go to Hong Kong. Their travel date has not been disclosed by relevant parties, but it will not be too long.</p>
<p>Legitimate Needs Will Be Supplied</p>
<p>Yesterday, sources from relevant banks pointed out that the Chinese legal tender is increasingly consolidated as the Exchange Stabilization Fund strives to maintain the exchange rate. If legitimate merchants request foreign exchange and can prove that the imported goods are necessities and goods from allied countries, they will be able to obtain US dollars at 5.34275 yuan or British pounds at 3.1875 yuan. In addition, China's foreign exchange stabilization fund and existing foreign exchange reserves are extremely abundant, sufficient to meet any legitimate needs.</p>
<p>Price Declines Expected in the Future</p>
<p>As for the drop in the exchange rate of the legal tender in Shanghai, there are many reasons, such as the diversion of customs revenue, the import of Japanese goods into the occupied areas, black market speculation, the escape of funds from the mainland and the concessions, the inability of the Chinese government to enforce power in the concessions, and the speculation of importers. If the government maintained the status of the legal tender at the past exchange rate, the result would be beneficial to importers of non-essential goods and arbitrageurs. However, it is a wise move for the authorities to seek a more natural price for the exchange rate of the legal tender and to supply foreign exchange for essential goods at this price. It should not be regarded as a genuine weakening of the legal tender. The high prices are not actually the result of the weakening of the legal tender, but merely the result of speculation and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. Once the foreign exchange settlement method is strictly implemented, prices are expected to decline.</p>
<p>Established Procedures Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange settlement methods drafted by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Hall-Patch in the Shanghai banking community, they have in fact been endorsed by various banks and importers. This plan will be submitted by Taylor and Hall-Patch to the upcoming full meeting of the Exchange Stabilization Committee in Hong Kong for discussion and approval, and will then be fully implemented. From the above, it can be seen that the results of the implementation are: first, the consolidation of the foundation of the legal tender; second, the decline in prices; and third, the protection of import trade. If the above four points can be fully achieved, most of the evil forces in the city can be eliminated. After Taylor and Hall-Patch go to Hong Kong, Taylor will still come to Shanghai to take responsibility for supervision, and Hall-Patch may return to Chongqing with other members. From all aspects, this Hong Kong small-scale meeting will have unprecedentedly satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Public Buses Planned to Resume Service Yesterday but Experienced Temporary Setbacks; Misunderstandings Resolved but Insufficient Time to Drive Buses; Authorities Are Making Every Effort to Mediate</h3>
<p>Workers at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company demanded increased allowances and improved personnel management systems. They went on strike the day before yesterday. After mediation, it was decided to first meet two preconditions, and it was originally scheduled to resume work yesterday morning. Due to temporary setbacks, the resumption of work was not successful. The authorities have been making every effort to persuade workers to resume work to maintain public transportation.</p>
<p>Temporary Setbacks</p>
<p>The preconditions negotiated the day before yesterday stipulated that the company would do its best to improve the personnel management system and accept the principle of increasing worker allowances. After the workers first resumed work, further open negotiations would be held. Thus, yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, maintenance and transportation workers went to resume work. At the company gate on Connaught Road, some workers were not very satisfied with the preconditions, resulting in setbacks, and the resumption of work was not successful. After receiving a report, the authorities immediately dispatched personnel to persuade the striking workers to comply with the preconditions and resume work first, and dispatched a large number of detectives to protect them.</p>
<p>Accepting Advice Until 11:00 AM, the workers accepted the advice and went to resume work again. Because they had not contacted the company in advance, there was a misunderstanding with the Russian manager, and the workers' resumption of work failed again. Subsequently, the company invited worker representatives to explain the misunderstanding. However, the workers who were preparing to resume work had dispersed one after another. Currently, the company and the authorities are trying to persuade the workers again, promising that the authorities will be responsible for mediating the issue of increasing worker allowances and preventing the company from dismissing workers without cause. There is a possibility of resuming work today.</p>
<h3>Situation in Shanghai Suburbs Remains the Same; Travel Requires Inspection; Hongkou Temporarily On Alert Due to Sniping of Japanese Soldiers; No Closure of Small Streets in the West District Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese side is busy erecting iron wire netting along the railway lines in Fan Huang Du, Xin Long Hua, and Zhongshan Road, preparing to investigate the residents there. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese side suddenly blocked the Baoyou Road intersection from the North Railway Station to the concession with iron barbed wire, cutting off traffic. As a result, train passengers from Nanjing to Shanghai could not enter the concession and waited at the Maichulu Road intersection, numbering no less than several hundred. It was not until around 10:00 AM that it was opened and traffic resumed. It is said that this temporary blockade was a temporary precaution arising from the sniping of two Japanese soldiers on Huaqing Road the previous night.</p>
<p>Everything as Usual in Contiguous Areas</p>
<p>The situation in areas contiguous to the concession remains the same. Only Yuyuan Road and the intersection of Great Western Road temporarily have iron nets erected, divided into entrances and exits. In addition to three special police officers, there are also two Japanese military police inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. That is, the areas around Xujiahui, Tushanwan, and Hongqiao Road have not had any obstacles placed at all, only prohibiting pedestrians from carrying objects in and out. The rumor that small lanes have been closed is inaccurate. As for the Suzhou Creek bridges, they were opened and closed intermittently yesterday, and the iron gates of the French Concession's 16th Wharf were also closed yesterday morning. Residents entering the Nanshi are subject to strict inspection. Everything else remains the same.</p>
<p>Closure Said to Occur in West District Small Streets</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that, according to responsible sources, the Japanese military authorities are currently closing off all the small lanes in the Hongqiao and Xujiahui districts in order to more strictly curb the infiltration of undesirable elements. According to the Japanese military authorities, residents of Chinese nationality in the Hongqiao and Xujiahui districts will be affected by the closure, but foreigners will still be allowed to travel freely. Residents of these two districts must travel on main roads guarded by Japanese sentries so that the Japanese side can conduct inspections to prevent anyone from taking action. The start date of this new restriction could not be confirmed, but it is rumored to be implemented starting tomorrow (27th).</p>
<p>Entry and Exit of Hongkou Subject to Strict Inspection Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that, at 9:00 PM yesterday (25th), two civilians employed by the Japanese Army in the Hongkou district, Shimoji Nobuyoshi (36 years old) and Suto Shigeyoshi (26 years old), were suddenly attacked at the intersection of Seward Road and Boone Road. The assailants escaped. Shimoji was shot eight times and died on the spot. Suto was also shot in the head and chest and was rushed to the hospital, where Japanese military doctors performed emergency treatment. He died of his injuries at 12:30 PM today (26th). The Japanese naval authorities are still conducting a major investigation in the Hongkou district and are strictly searching pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving Hongkou. As a result, traffic was congested on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek this morning, and passengers had to get out of their vehicles so that Japanese sentries could conduct careful searches. According to the shooting case yesterday morning, it was the third attack on Japanese people in the Hongkou district in the past week. The previous Japanese civilians who were assassinated were employees of Japanese cotton mills.</p>

<p>The staff of this newspaper are currently engaged in reviewing and investigating those employees of industry and commerce who have submitted applications for scholarships. Since various extracurricular cram schools and vocational schools will be opening in early September, we sincerely hope that store employees who have already received application forms will complete the application procedures as soon as possible. This newspaper plans to announce the first batch of approved names on September 1 to facilitate the completion of enrollment procedures in advance. For those who submit applications later or who will not be affected by the school's class time, we will continue to review and announce them in succession. In addition, this newspaper would like to thank all vocational schools, specialized schools, and cram schools that generously donate one "Shanghai News free scholarship" for the benefit of out-of-school employees. However, for those schools that have set class times, this newspaper will expedite the enrollment procedures for all employees as soon as possible to live up to the schools' kindness to young people. However, time is tight, and we sincerely hope that all schools can provide considerable convenience to the entrants within their possible range and that all schools can indicate the tutoring subjects and times in detail so that aspiring entrants can refer to them.</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Studies Looser Restrictions on Electricity Usage; Recent Oil Imports Nearly Equal to Previous Year; Shanghai International Settlement Decides to Restrict Excessive Electricity Use</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that an employee of the Shanghai French Tramways and Electricity Company stated yesterday (25th) that if the company's current fuel reserves are not significantly reduced, the electricity consumption in the French Concession will not be subject to greater restrictions. The company's recent</p>
<p>Fuel Imports</p>
<p>are nearly equal to those imported last year. However, the Municipal Council's Restrictions Committee is giving careful consideration to the issue of electricity consumption and is studying requests for looser implementation of current restrictions on a daily basis. These requests are judged separately based on whether they are appropriate, the source said. The French Concession has implemented restrictions on electricity usage since last year, stipulating that users within the concession who exceed the specified monthly limit will have the excess electricity deducted from their limit for the following month. If they exceed their limit again in the following month, they will be</p>
<p>Disconnecting Power</p>
<p>as punishment, and power will not be restored until the excess usage is paid in full. The Shanghai International Settlement's measures for punishing excessive electricity use have recently been approved by the Public Works Department, aiming to conserve the Shanghai Power Company's gradually diminishing fuel reserves.</p>
<h3>U.S. Court Temporary Judge Sworn In</h3>
<p>Mr. Lawton, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Consular Court in this port, was formally sworn in yesterday at 11:00 AM after receiving an order from President Roosevelt the day before yesterday, specially appointing him as Temporary Judge of the U.S. Court in China to replace Judge Helmick, who is returning to the U.S. for vacation. Mr. Collins, Clerk of the U.S. Court in China, administered the oath. Those present at the scene included Mr. Shields, U.S. Attorney for China, Mr. Waterting, Chief of Purchasing for the U.S. Navy in this port, and staff members of the U.S. Court in China. It is understood that, in addition to trying the Tytell Bau embezzlement case, Lawton will also handle other affairs of the U.S. Court until Judge Helmick returns to Shanghai. However, the date of the Tytell case trial has not yet been decided and is not far off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Free French Leader, Aigrain, Has Been Released; Details of Trial in Saigon Unknown</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports: Shanghai received news yesterday (the 25th) that Mr. Aigrain, a French businessman in Shanghai who was arrested on the morning of April 9th, has now been released after being detained in Saigon for four months. Friends in Shanghai were pleased to hear this news.</p>
<p>Aigrain is currently still in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Details of his release have not yet been received. Aigrain was the leader of the Free French movement in Shanghai and was originally the chairman of the Shanghai French Veterans Association. He was later replaced by order of Vichy. On the morning of April 5th, Aigrain was suddenly arrested at his apartment on Route Lafayette, Rue Cardinal Mercier, by the French naval authorities and taken aboard the French gunboat "Garnault". The French authorities did not specify what crime Aigrain was accused of.</p>
<p>It was rumored that his detention was related to the escape of several sailors from the French gunboat. Aigrain was taken to Saigon for trial two weeks after being detained, and rumors circulated that he had been transferred to France. After that, there was no news, and only now has news of his release arrived. Details of his trial in Saigon are still unknown. The English-language "China Press" also reports that Aigrain &amp; Co. in this city has no information about the whereabouts of its owner, Aigrain, nor do they know if he is already on his way back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Argentine Club Selects Miss China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Association, to raise funds for the relief of foreign refugees without support, is sponsoring the 1941 "Miss China" competition. Last night at 9 pm, it was held at the beautiful Argentine Club on Avenue Haig. Tickets were five yuan per person, and all proceeds will be used for the Refugee Association's relief efforts. Many beautiful Chinese and foreign women participated last night. However, the election results will be announced next Tuesday, still at the Argentine Club. The winner selected as "Miss China" will receive a prize of 1,500 yuan and will be interviewed by Mr. Paul Chai, the Shanghai representative of an American film company, for a film shooting test. Then she will travel with him to America to visit Hollywood. The second prize is 750 yuan, the third prize is 500 yuan, and the other seven runners-up will each receive a prize of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Debts Involving Hard Silver Dollars Should Be Calculated According to Legal Tender</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance states that hard currency silver dollars have long been replaced by legal tender. Disputes often arise in civil debt relationships, and some contracts even openly state that a certain number of legal tender dollars is equivalent to one silver dollar, which affects the legal tender system. The Ministry of Finance has issued a separate circular to each province to strictly prohibit this. If silver dollars must be converted for debt obligations, the official exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance at that time should be used for the calculation.</p>
<h3>Compiling Methods for the Cost of Living Index for Chinese Staff (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Cai Zhengya</p>
<p>How to Keep Accounts</p>
<p>Keeping accounts is not difficult in itself; the difficulty lies in perseverance. The best method is for the whole family to have a small notebook and record expenses and income at any time. In the evening, this is given to the housewife to enter into the account book. However, this is for the average family and should be adapted to the circumstances of each family, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. If it is too burdensome, it may not be sustainable. Keeping accounts is a good habit, and if a family has detailed records of income and expenses, it can create a budget year by year, month by month. Why should income and expenses not be able to balance each other? Based on this, even if it is not for compiling an index, it is necessary to promote it. If children learn this from a young age, it will be very useful for the future.</p>
<p>Family Selection</p>
<p>The standards set by this office for selecting accounting families are divided into six items, which have already been reported in the newspapers and will not be repeated here. However, there are still several points that need to be clarified: (1) The phrase "does not rely on income from ancestral property or parental subsidies" refers to large amounts. If there is a small amount of ancestral property or occasional parental subsidies, they can still be selected, as the emphasis is on "independence." (2) The phrase "resides in the service unit without paying rent" refers to those who pay no rent at all. If a small amount of rent is paid, they can still be selected. (3) The phrase "salary is limited to no more than 1,000 yuan in legal tender" refers to income. There are no regulations regarding the amount of expenditure.</p>
<p>Of the accounting families selected by this office, those with incomes below 500 yuan should account for 70%, and those with incomes between 500 and 1,000 yuan should account for 30%. This is because there are more families with lower incomes, and the proportion must be such. Income and expenses should also be normal. If the income is meager and the expenditure is huge, with a large difference, it is abnormal. For example, if the income is only 200-300 yuan, but the expenditure is as high as 2,000-3,000 yuan, and there are other means of support, it is abnormal. In abnormal cases, there may be concealment when keeping accounts, with more reported as less, or less reported as more, so the compiled index cannot be accurate.</p>
<p>This office plans to solicit 500 accounting families, but to reach this number, it will take several times the effort, because some may not be able to maintain it consistently, or the records may not be usable and must be strictly selected. If the records are detailed and consistently maintained, the time, manpower, and financial resources spent by this office can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Account Books Are Strictly Confidential</p>
<p>This office strictly keeps the information recorded by each family confidential. After receiving the application letters, this office will number them. The account books will only contain the number, not the name. The analysts will not know whose book it is, so there is absolutely no possibility of leakage. The statistical staff have received considerable education and know how to respect themselves, so applicant families can rest assured.</p>
<p>Procedures for Issuing and Collecting Account Books</p>
<p>Regarding the procedures, after receiving the application letters, this office will review them and send a letter of registration. At the end of September, each family will be sent an account book and accounting instructions, as well as an envelope with the address of this office printed on it. After completing one month of records, the account book should be mailed back on the first of December without needing to add postage. The account books must be returned on time each month for review and analysis. After three months, we will send an inquiry about rent and servants' wages every three months and ask for a reply.</p>
<p>The Contribution of This Research</p>
<p>After the index is compiled in the future, the impact of price increases and decreases on life will be easily seen, which can be used to adjust salaries and subsidies and mediate disputes between employers and employees, so there will be a standard to follow. In addition, there are other contributions, such as nutrition. When the study on the living standards of Westerners was compiled, the Lester Institute of Medical Research was asked to conduct a detailed analysis, and it was found that Russians were malnourished, and British and American residents consumed too much sugar. Few Chinese people are physically healthy, and tuberculosis is common, which is related to nutrition. Nutrients are not about quantity or high prices, but about balance. With these detailed accounts, once analyzed, we can study this in detail. This is only one of the issues, mentioned as an example, and will not be elaborated further.</p>
<p>In short, this decision to compile a cost of living index is a matter of public interest and relies on the cooperation of people from all walks of life to achieve success. I would like to thank the Industrial and Social Affairs Department on behalf of the community. (End)</p>
<h3>Teachers and Staff Should Quickly Apply to Be Accounting Families</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is soliciting staff families to keep detailed records of income and expenses for three months to compile a cost of living index. As seen in various newspapers, people from all walks of life have been applying recently, but the number of teachers and staff from primary and secondary schools is still insufficient. This is because schools are still on vacation, and it is more difficult to contact them. However, considering the population of this city, primary and secondary school teachers and staff occupy an extremely important position. Since the index represents all stages of staff, it must be distributed evenly. Teachers and staff should actively participate for their own sake, so as to provide a reference for the education authorities to improve their lives and focus on education. Those who wish to apply can send a letter directly to the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road.</p>

<h3>Manager of China United Trust Company, Yan Chengde, Was Kidnapped Yesterday; Five Armed Bandits Snatched Him Away in a Car</h3>
<p>At around 8:55 yesterday morning, a kidnapping case occurred at the entrance of Lane 666, Tiantong Road (intersection of North Shansi Road), namely Baoqing Lane. The kidnapped person was Yan Chengde, manager of China United Trust Company at 270 Beijing Road, a native of Shaoxing, 50+ years old, residing at No. 33, Baoqing Lane, Lane 666, Tiantong Road, Shanghai. His wife, Shen, is 58 years old, and they have five sons and three daughters. Except for the eldest son, Yan Liucun, who is working at the Shanghai General Post Office, the other four sons are still in school. The three daughters have all been married. Yan has a chartered car for transportation. Yesterday morning, at around 8:50, Yan finished breakfast at home, dressed in a light gray pongee long gown, and as usual, the driver Zhao Er was pulling him to the company to work. Unexpectedly, just as he exited the entrance of Baoqing Lane and was about to turn the corner, five bandits who had been lying in wait suddenly rushed out, all armed with guns, and blocked Yan's car, not allowing it to proceed. First, they beat up the driver Er with fists and feet and forced him to stand aside, not allowing him to make a sound. Then, they dragged Yan Chengde from the car and forced him into a black-plated car with rental permit No. 9681 (the permit may be fake), which was parked there in advance, and sped off westwards without a trace. The driver, seeing the bandits going far away, rushed back to Yan's home to report. Yan's wife and others immediately reported the incident to the Huishi Police Station in that district. The police authorities immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and took the driver back to the police station for questioning. They immediately ordered their subordinates to investigate.</p>
<h3>Barber Shop Owner Shot; Seriously Wounded in Chest and Back</h3>
<p>At 3:04 pm yesterday, a bloody incident occurred on Tiantong Road. Wang Yingde (43 years old, native of Yangzhou), the owner of Zhenxin Barber Shop at 804 Tiantong Road, was wearing a gray Pulis suit and trousers at the time of the incident, with only a undershirt on his upper body. He walked out of the shop to buy goldfish at the entrance. As he was bending over, two men suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One of them pulled out a gun and fired two shots at Wang, hitting Wang's chest and back, causing him to fall to the ground injured. After receiving the news, the police quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, but the murderers were already gone. The injured person was taken to a sanitarium for treatment. It is said that the injuries were very serious. It is reported that Wang used to work somewhere. His wife's name is Wang Xiuhua, and she is currently an actress in the Yangzhou troupe at the Great World.</p>

<h3>Young Man and Dance Hostess Attempt Suicide with Poison</h3>
<p>At around midnight yesterday, a man and a woman in No. 187, Dazhan Road in the Public Concession, simultaneously attempted suicide by taking poison. They were discovered by their family and sent to the hospital, where they recovered. It was later learned that the man's name was Xu Weiyu (18 years old), and the woman's name was Cao Meimei (17 years old), a dance hostess. Xu often went to dance and was deeply in love with the woman, hoping for a lifelong relationship. However, the woman's parents depended on her earnings as a dance hostess for their livelihood. If she married Xu, Xu would have to support the two elders. Xu was unable to do so, so he and the woman took poison at her home, intending to die together.</p>
<h3>Bomb Delivered to Yi Xin Printing Company</h3>
<p>At 5:26 pm yesterday, a man suddenly brought a paper-wrapped package to the counter of Yi Xin Printing Company at 426 Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession. After delivering it, he turned around and left. Later, a colleague of the company opened it and was shocked to find that it was a hand grenade. He immediately reported the incident to the police, who sent officers to take it away for destruction and investigate the source of the bomb.</p>
<h3>Truck Falls During Repairs, Crushing Driver to Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Jianglin, a native of Chongming, 45 years old, worked as a truck driver at the garbage truck depot of the French Municipal Council. He lived alone in Shanghai in a bungalow at the intersection of Route Massenet and Rue Jasi. At 3 pm yesterday, Zhang was at the vehicle repair shop of the French Municipal Council at No. 8 Rue Chévert. Garbage truck No. 749 was damaged and was being lifted by garbage coolies and mechanics. Wood was used to support it during repairs. Unexpectedly, the wood was oily and slipped, causing the lifted truck to fall. Zhang happened to be standing under the truck and could not avoid it, resulting in a head injury and instant death. The police received a report, sent detectives to investigate, and sent the body to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

Judge Feng ordered permission to detain them for retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tongren Fuyuantang Appeals for Funding for Coffins</h3>
<p>The hall has been handling various charitable activities in the Nanshi area for a long time. The annual expenses are all paid by income from real estate, which is used for distribution and payment. It has never sought donations from outside. After the war, the hall was destroyed, and the rented houses were mostly damaged by the war, resulting in very little income. Therefore, it mortgaged and borrowed money, assessing the urgency of its undertakings and carefully managing its resources to barely maintain the status quo. Recently, it has exhausted its resources and has no way to borrow money. Prices have also risen without limit. The most difficult problem it currently faces is the coffin donation. A coffin costs more than 50 yuan. The average number of coffins distributed monthly in Nanshi, Huxi, Pudong, and the French Concession is more than 600, requiring more than 30,000 yuan in national currency. This does not include the cost of coffin transport vehicles, coffin boats, the labor and food for the gravediggers, and all administrative expenses. This undertaking is of great importance to local sanitation and international public image, and to prevent epidemics. It should be carried out actively and cannot be stopped for a single day. Therefore, it has prepared donation registers and has begun fundraising, relying on kind-hearted people from all walks of life to donate generously in order to fulfill this righteous cause and benefit the poor. To prevent fraud, donations should be sent to the hall's office at No. 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, and receipts should be obtained.</p>
<h3>St. John's English College Enrolls Students</h3>
<p>Founded by Alumni of St. John's University</p>
<p>Guo Chengen, Cen Dezhang, Liu Zhiyi, and many other alumni of St. John's University are planning to establish a night school specializing in English, named "St. John's English College." There are seven classes from elementary to senior high school, with a limit of 40 students per class. Elective courses such as translation, conversation, business, and English will also be offered to meet special needs. The teaching methods and management strive to be strict. Zhou Yueran has now been appointed as the principal. The main campus of the school is located at No. 598, the intersection of Avenue du Bac and Avenue Haig, and the branch campus is located on the 4th floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road. Enrollment has begun. This is good news for those in Shanghai who are interested in learning English.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>In the "700,000 Yuan Kidnapping Case" reported in the local news section of your newspaper, one of the arrested criminals is named Zhou Zhifeng. I believe that this is a case of the same name and surname. The Zhou Zhifeng in question is someone else. I have been working in the woolen industry for more than 20 years, and I have always been law-abiding. However, the outside world has been misled by this news, and friends and relatives have been coming to inquire. I am writing to you specifically to request that your newspaper publish a statement to avoid misunderstandings and correct the public perception.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of "Fully Booked"</h3>
<p>— Fei Le</p>
<p>Heaven? Hell? Prosperity? Or something else?</p>
<p>If someone were to ask what the most distinctive feature of the isolated island is, "Fully Booked" might be all of it!</p>
<p>Don't underestimate these two simple words! "Fully Booked" truly contains so much heaven, so much hell! So much darkness, so much contradiction!</p>
<p>Theaters are the most proud creations of "Fully Booked"! Look at the neon signs that say "Upstairs and Downstairs Fully Booked," emitting proud light to demonstrate to the audience who are barred outside the iron gates!</p>
<p>"Please come early tomorrow," a defeat, but plan for tomorrow's victory and participate in this "full" group!</p>
<p>I wonder why the "bums" standing in front of restaurants are so fashionable? No, it turns out they are not bums, but people waiting for empty seats in the restaurant!</p>
<p>Despite your "2 yuan per person for a big meal" or "200 yuan and up for a full course," the isolated island has plenty of money, resulting in "Fully Booked"!</p>
<p>Hotels are already called "restaurants," so they are no longer places to "accommodate merchants"! Instead, what welcomes "guests" are mahjong, women, and alcohol! With these three things, are you still afraid that the "Fully Booked" sign will not be hung high?</p>
<p>"Hey, that's not dancing, it's simply frying peanuts!"</p>
<p>Don't laugh at this "bumpkin's" words, this is a true portrayal of "full" in the dance halls!</p>
<p>Languid music, enchanting women, foaming alcohol, and flying banknotes, flowing sweat, fill the ranks of this "fullness"!</p>
<p>A few years ago, the red strips of paper on telephone poles that read "Soliciting a Wife" were considered as boring as "Heaven and Earth"; now, they have become treasures. People are rushing to rent a top of a building, and the early bird catches the worm!</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the news that "108 people live above and below"? Today, the "full" situation in general residences is truly unimaginable! — squeezed like bedbugs in a palm awning, restricted like a coffin.</p>
<p>"Interception," "sleeping on the floor," "tin sheds,"— all these are products of "Fully Booked"!</p>
<p>The "Fully Booked" status of refugee camps is well-known. Since several have been closed, the remaining ones are even more "overcrowded."</p>
<p>The national crisis has abnormally spawned a group of people who send goods to warehouses. As a result, foreign warehouses and storage warehouses are all "Fully Booked."</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>"Prisons are Fully Booked!"</p>
<p>Life and environment have created a wide range of criminals — robbery, embezzlement, indecency,... and others.</p>
<p>The streetcar ticket seller pulls hard and yells: "Wait for the next one!"</p>
<p>The bus conductor says repeatedly to the gentlemen: Fully Booked!</p>
<p>Xiangsheng and Yunfei reply: "No empty taxis!"</p>
<p>The travel agency staff tells travelers: "The cabins on the Yong Sheng Lun are all booked!"</p>
<p>If you get sick and go to a "famous doctor" to seek medical treatment, get an ordinary number. If you wait from dawn to noon, you still can't get in, unless you take out a few legal tender bills to pay for the "priority number fee"!</p>
<p>Since there is sickness, there is also "death." When people die, they have to be sent to funeral homes. Therefore, funeral homes also announce that they are fully booked.</p>
<p>The casket deposit places of funeral homes can be said to be completely in the style of secondary landlords, with ones as wide as a "living room," ones as elegant as a "pavilion," and ones as cramped as an "attic." Funeral homes repeatedly build "new rentals," but it is still not enough. It seems that in the near future, casket deposit places will definitely have things like "transfer fee," "tips," and "security deposit"!</p>
<p>"Fully Booked"……</p>
<p>"Fully Booked according to seniority!" The bold words of the isolated island, that is all!</p>
<p>"Fully Booked"! Is it prosperity? Is it evil? Is it enough to make the isolated island proud?</p>
<p>I think this is just a mystery, and everyone can see it clearly!</p>
<h3>Seeing and Thinking</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Near Zhengjia Muqiao in the French Concession, there is a small restaurant that also serves cold drinks. A red sign hangs at the door, which reads: "Haha! The Autumn Tiger is here. This store has all kinds of cold drinks." Although this is an ordinary sign to attract customers, the word "haha" added on top is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The literary style is extremely unique. It should be commended immediately!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Disturbances</p>
<p>Mei Bao knew her father's personality. If she didn't leave, if he left first, he would never agree. Therefore, she could only force a smile and followed behind Xiao Gouzi, walking step by step west along a small road made of mud and coal ash.</p>
<p>As usual, she looked back several times. She only saw her father standing straight in the cold wind, wearing a gray cotton-padded jacket and pants, watching her. In the past few times that Mei Bao went to the city, Qiu Haitang would often stand at the door of her own home or in the middle of the road, staring at her daughter's back, but she would always disappear by the fourth or fifth time that Mei Bao turned her neck to look. This time, not only did he send her all the way to the edge of town, but he also stood there staring blankly without going back. When Mei Bao had walked four or fifty yards and was about to turn the corner, she could still vaguely see this blurry figure from afar.</p>
<p>"Strange, I have been going to the city to study for three years, why does Dad seem so particularly worried this time?" She couldn't help but say softly to Xiao Gouzi.</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi also responded quickly.</p>
<p>"It's all because you wanted to learn to sing opera! Miss, please don't mess around again in the future. I have served him for seven or eight years, and the only one he loves the most is you. If something really happens, it's not that I want to say anything to you"...Xiao Gouzi had been walking ahead with his head down all along. When he said this sentence, he turned back to look at Mei Bao: "Miss, how can you live with yourself?"</p>
<p>Although Mei Bao also felt that Xiao Gouzi's words were very correct, she still didn't believe that such a small dispute between herself and Shang Laoer would entangle or escalate to any extent. (195)</p>
<h3>Hopes for Teacher's Day</h3>
<p>— Hu Luo</p>
<p>The living problems of primary school teachers have reached an extreme. Some superficial research is of no benefit to the facts. Many experienced teachers have turned to other professional sectors. Many teachers who are interested in education and willing to do research spend their entire time teaching at school and tutoring at home to make a living, thus unintentionally cutting off their interest in educational research. If this continues, the future of education will be quite unfortunate.</p>
<p>Caring people in educational circles, please extend your hands of friendship! Helping primary school teachers to live is helping the normal development and progress of education, and it is also helping the children of the next generation, including your own.</p>
<p>Improving one's own life should be achieved through one's own efforts. Fellow primary school teachers struggling on the line of hunger, please do not grieve or lament alone.</p>
<p>Here are two suggestions for fellow primary school teachers and people in the community, hoping to inspire further, more concrete and practical solutions:</p>
<p>First, hope for people in the community, educational organizations, and school authorities. Starting next semester, some enlightened school authorities in this city may allocate most of the increased tuition fees to teachers' salaries. However, some principals do not do so, so I want to ask the school authorities to give them more sympathy.</p>
<p>Second, hope for the teachers themselves: everyone should run consumer cooperative businesses for necessities such as rice and coal, and directly contact the Public Works Department, coal briquette factories, and other manufacturers to request price reductions in order to lighten the burden on teachers. For example, Yitai Hing Coal Briquette Factory used to have preferential measures for primary school teachers. If primary school teachers formally request it, they will definitely be able to obtain greater preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Fellow primary school teachers! Please earnestly commemorate our festival. We want to live, for the sake of education, for the sake of children, for the sake of our responsibility. We are willing to endure all suffering and get through this difficult era.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Conducting a Taoist Ritual</h3>
<p>— Xu Xun</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhu's article "Is It Time for Another Taoist Ritual?" the other day, I have a few small opinions to offer.</p>
<p>"Taoist rituals," this kind of thing, in Shanghai, mostly have other functions. This is just a way for idlers to make money.</p>
<p>They use the name of Taoist rituals to "persuade" the local residents, and the purpose is only to fill their own pockets and for their own consumption. In the current social situation, they will also say that the prices of various items are soaring and the expenses are huge, and they want each resident to spend at least two or three yuan in legal tender, and maybe five or six yuan or more. Most residents, seeing their usual behavior, some find them annoying, some are afraid of them (whether people or ghosts), and they will very painfully and readily reward them. They have also seized this psychological weakness and come to a "harvest" very naturally every year. (The places where this kind of Taoist ritual occurs are probably the places where ordinary people live, and they are not rich; therefore, it is said that they pay this money painfully.)</p>
<p>They, these special elements, each occupy an area, with fixed boundaries, and are not allowed to infringe on each other. However, in the past, during the season of Taoist rituals, we often heard news of them causing "all-out fights" and "brawls" due to disputes over territory.</p>
<p>In short, this act of conducting Taoist rituals poses problems for the safety of residents and the order of society. We should find ways to make them disappear.</p>
<p>The best way is for residents to refuse to pay this unnecessary amount of money at this time of expensive rice and firewood. Then, after they fail to receive money, they can save a lot of effort. (Royalties will be used for student aid)</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Fuxing</p>
<p>Suppose a "Taoist ritual" requires 200 yuan for tin foil, 30 yuan for colored paper, 100 yuan for Taoist priests or monks, 50 yuan for labor, 60 yuan for renting equipment, and 60 yuan for other miscellaneous expenses; if there are 1,000 alleys in Shanghai holding Taoist rituals every year, then 500,000 yuan is needed every year. If used for charity, many more people could be saved every year.</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Ziyu</p>
<p>Host: Your cooking skills are superb.</p>
<p>Cook: Why?</p>
<p>Host: Because the shredded pork you cook is so thin and short, so cleverly small that even cutting it with a microscope would be scary!</p>
<p>Cook: ...I'm afraid that's also because of money, right!</p>
<p>Host: ....</p>
<h3>Gibberish</h3>
<p>— Huanjun</p>
<p>Barber: The hair behind your head is best cut a little shorter, otherwise it will grow a lot in a few days, which is annoying.</p>
<p>Barber: Sir! This is a very easy problem to solve. Just come twice more a month.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from Shouchun Kettle Studio</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Insights on Catching and Releasing Cao (Part 2)</p>
<p>I think: in the future, when singing this play again, we should follow this method and add a few more people of different colors. It is okay to have all the people backstage come on stage. First, it will make Cao Cao kill to his heart's content, and second, it will make the people in the audience feel that it is terribly tragic. They run up from the entrance door and go down from the exit door. Although they are said to be killed, they will not actually injure a single hair. It is easy and effortless, why not give it a try.</p>
<p>(3) After Cao Cao kills the family members of Mr. Lü, Chen Gong catches up. Usually, Cao Cao turns around at this time and can raise his sword as if to chop down. At this time, Chen Gong looks frightened and sings the sentence "It scares my three souls and seven spirits." Usually, the person who plays Chen Gong thinks that his fear is because he is afraid of the bright and bloody sword in Cao Cao's hand, which almost chopped his own head off. So his eyes are still looking high while singing this sentence. Thousands of people perform this, and they are mostly the same. I alone feel that it is not so. I think that Chen Gong chasing down and up is to stop him from killing people and causing trouble. Unexpectedly, he was one step late and suddenly saw corpses lying all over the ground, heads rolling around, and fresh blood flowing straight out. He knew that he had heard of a great disaster, and he was afraid of this, not that Cao Cao would kill him. Cao Cao did not kill him either. Someone asked: Cao Cao's sword did pass over Chen Gong's head, isn't it very dangerous? I said, no, this is the method of coming on stage, deliberately making a sensational stroke. Cao Cao's sword and Chen Gong's head have no intention of getting close at all. Since this is the case, the appearance of Chen Gong when he comes on stage can still be done, and after doing it, quickly get up, walk a few steps forward, look at the ground and around, and then sing the sentence "It scares me", which is more appropriate. I wonder what the experts in the country think?</p>
<h3>Visiting Tianfeng Drama Club</h3>
<p>— Lu Si</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" will be revised again and the cast will be changed. It is also said that Ying Yin may have the hope of appearing on stage, which is a very interesting thing. However, Tianfeng's next play "Gold Rush" has already been announced, and the exact situation is unknown. The reporter then visited the Tianfeng Drama Club and got the person in charge of the club to answer the questions. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>(Question): Is there any news that "Grievances in the Qing Palace" will be revised?</p>
<p>(Answer): Yes, because Mr. Yao Ke's first draft was relatively hasty, and when it was performed, it was too long, so many deletions and changes were made, so there were inevitably many unsatisfactory points. It was originally only prepared to be performed for ten days before rewriting, but later because there were too many viewers, it was impossible to stop, so it was extended to the present. Now Mr. Yao is determined to rewrite, eliminate the dross and retain the essence, so that it is more vivid and more powerful.</p>
<p>(Question): It is said that the cast will also be changed?</p>
<p>(Answer): Originally, it is difficult for actors to support heavy plays in hot weather. Now that there is a new version, several actors may take this opportunity to rest a little. However, most of the actors will still not be changed.</p>
<p>(Question): Are the newly changed actors basic actors of your club?</p>
<p>(Answer): Not necessarily, but in principle, we always give priority to using our own actors.</p>
<p>(Question): It is rumored that Ying Yin has accepted Tianfeng's invitation to participate in the performance. Is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer): Our club has not invited her, so there is no question of accepting the performance.</p>
<p>(Question): Is the new cast rehearsing well?</p>
<p>(Answer): Still in rehearsal. Recently, Mr. Fei Mu has been coming to the club every day to direct.</p>
<p>(Question): When can "Gold Rush" be staged?</p>
<p>(Answer): That depends on the situation of "Grievances in the Qing Palace".</p>
<p>(Question): What kind of script is "Gold Rush"? Is it being rehearsed now?</p>
<p>(Answer): This is a three-act comedy seven (more exaggerated than comedy). It is written by Bao Lei and directed by Luo Ming. It is currently in rehearsal.</p>
<p>At this point, I knew a little about the inside story, and then I resigned and left.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Li Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Where is the powerful family that forcibly carries her home?</p>
<p>The poet followed and saw many figures in the ship's window. He shouted, "Yuanyuan, Yuanyuan!" It was pitiful that although Yuanyuan could hear the poet's voice in the cabin, she could not say a word to the poet at this time. She only hated that the secret messengers had come too late, which had delayed the big event. Probably it was her destiny, so what else could she say? Hua Hudie heard the shouting, opened the window, and poked his head out to take a look. He recognized the Jade-cherishing poet and gritted his teeth and said loudly, "Who is shouting here? Do you know that Father-in-law Tian is carrying the beauty back in the boat? Don't disturb Father-in-law, or you will be punished!" Hua Hudie said this clearly to the poet, making him despair of Yuanyuan and feel sad. It was also to vent his anger. But when the poet heard the words, he knew that Yuanyuan had been taken away by Tian Hongyu. He had wasted his efforts and caught nothing. He wondered how Yuanyuan would hate him. He watched the painted boat, unable to take back the beauty, and his hope was gone! Because he was anxious in his heart, he spat out a mouthful of blood, shouted "Oh," and immediately fell to the bow of the boat. But the painted boat had already hoisted a big sail, and eight oars were beating on both sides, flying towards the city. The boatman on the poet's boat hurriedly woke up the poet and carried him home. Tian Hongyu and his party returned to the city together and sent Yuanyuan to live in the guest house, where people were always watching over her. Tian Hongyu thanked Hua Hudie repeatedly and comforted Yuanyuan with all kinds of good words. But the sorrow in Yuanyuan's heart could not be concealed, and she shed tears in secret. At this time, she was like a bird in a cage, losing all freedom and being manipulated by others. Tian Hongyu got Yuanyuan, as if he had obtained the most precious thing. Because the vacation was coming to an end, he was eager to return to Beijing, so he took Yuanyuan and left Wumen. He went north safely all the way, and local officials took care of and escorted him along the way. Tian Hongyu tried every possible way to please Yuanyuan between the wheels and ships, wanting to make her smile. However, Yuanyuan hated her fate and had no chance to serve the talented scholar, so a Tian old man came out of nowhere and broke up her marriage with the poet. How desolate was she in her heart! Hou fought like the sea, and Xiao Lang was a stranger. I am afraid that she would never see the poet again in this life! (152)</p>
<h3>Twin Beauties</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang has the nickname of "Favorite of Heaven" in today's film industry. In the past, costume films were popular, and she was the leading actress for many consecutive films. Recently, fashion films have been revived, and she is still the leading actress, always popular.</p>
<p>The production of "New Sisters" is gradually becoming tense. Chen Yunshang plays the roles of the sisters Qiyun and Qixia alone in the play in a special manner. The personality performances are completely different, and the psychological changes are completely different; one is a romantic and luxurious school, and the other is a loyal and simple school. The joint performance is very important from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The picture above is Chen Yunshang's "New Sisters" twin beauty picture, with a kind smile and deep emotions, specially sent to the entertainment world to share with readers.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Harmonica Factory and the Shanghai Harmonica Association jointly held the city's harmonica solo championship, which is scheduled for the finals on the 31st, at 9:00 am at the Grand Stage.

Recently, in order to promote amateur and proper entertainment, the Yishe Ping Opera Research Society was specially organized, with Ye Ningsheng as the president. The famous Peking opera Su Shaoqing was hired to teach Tan's famous plays. They are currently learning "Lifting the Tripod, Watching the Book, and Fighting Taiping", etc., and it is said that a rehearsal will be held soon. (3) The Youth Drama Club hired senior drama experts Xia Feng, Wu Jing, Wu Chongwen, etc. as permanent instructors.

<h3>Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Yuyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(3)(4) Wang Yaoqing</p>
<p>Wang Yaoqing is the master of contemporary female roles. An elder of Qingyi, this is the only one remaining. However, Yaoqing has taken off her dancing shirt for more than a decade, and people regard her as a rare fruit, but they can only imagine her past, and can no longer use her skills to sell them to the world. Yaoqing achieved success very early. In her youth, she had already moved the nine cities and was praised as unparalleled. At that time, Tan Xinpei performed, and the Qingyi supporting role would not be pleasing to him if it was not Yaoqing, so Yaoqing's name became more and more famous. Yaoqing was a junior to Lao Tan and also benefited from Tan's promotion. However, she was arrogant and often refused to give in. Lao Tan loved her talent and instead accommodated her in every way, so it can be seen how successful she was in those years! However, Tan could not bear it for a long time, and eventually they separated. Yaoqing soon lost her voice and could no longer rely on her singing to compete with the latecomers. Her sharp edges were slightly restrained. Yaoqing's talent was outstanding, and her intelligence was extraordinary. After her voice failed, she devoted herself to Bai Kou's acting skills. She was good at portraying expressions in acting, and each play was different, showing her identity and personality. Her flag costumes were indeed unparalleled at the time. Although the late Dan corners all took Yaoqing as a model, exerting their strength to seek her likeness, no one could catch up with her. In the past ten years or so, her physical strength has become more and more weakened, and it is difficult for her to finish the scene even when singing Baikou with her own voice. Therefore, she has devoted herself to teaching her disciples in order to provide for her life. Her disciples are all over the north and south. It can be said that if the Dan corner does not receive Yaoqing's instructions, she cannot reach the upper class and gallop in the music scene to compete with her peers. Yaoqing is also proud of this. In the Pear Garden industry, the only people who can change the trend of the times are Jiao Tian and Yaoqing. Although they take different paths, they are all outstanding people!</p>
