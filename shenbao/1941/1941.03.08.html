<p>社評</p>
<h3>近日之恐慌</h3>
<p>近一週來，上海市民生活，受囤米者不肯應市之影響，異常深刻而嚴重；蓋不僅洋米之暗盤貼價層出而飛騰不止，其他日用生活所必需之品，如麫粉，市上零售逾三十元，粳米逾一百二十元，乃至於肥皂火柴火油洋燭，無一不漲十三四，此何故歟！非爲無到貨也，到貨固絡繹而來；嘗見風馳電掣而過鬧市者，龐大之車輛，纍纍然所滿載者米糧麪粉油燭柴皂也。亦非爲幣値之影響也，蓋最近之匯市，長居多而縮者少，至少亦保持舊有之匯率，故無輿於物價之變遷也。又非爲市民購積所致也，蓋以今日之米珠薪桂，居室之狹隘簡陋，供起居尙不足，鳥有餘地以供購積，况有度日不遑者，擔石之儲，竭蹶萬分，寗有餘力以多儲乎？要之，今日物價之異常飛漲，非爲供給之不繼，非爲消費之過渡，亦非爲弊値之變動，乃爲營其業者，貪狠壟斷，此孝彼尤，以對儲存貨爲得計，必待更善之價而沽；寗謝絕當前之買賣，以留待往後之剝削。市人鑒於購　之不易，更奔走購求惟恐不及；及至一再撲空，不禁相顧失色。情形若此，殷願關心整個上海市之運命者，其勿疎忽最近數日來市儈所釀成之人心恐慌；要知近日恐慌之程度，較諸習聞之百物騰貴，生活艱難，又超越幾分矣</p>
<p>賢明達練之工商界君子其注意之乎？彼利令智昏，狼心狗肺之巾儈，不足與語，亦不足與較也。盍默察目前之市况，豈復是二三年來所謂畸形發展之市况，蓋確趨凋敝矣，確近枯竭矣；不但計之以實銷之貨已見銳减，即計之以劇漲後實收之貨款亦漸降落，此實嚴重之危象也。門庭如市者，能有幾業幾家？　蹀門前，必有所需，及見標價之高，逡巡而去者，何業無之，何地無之？更考之各業內情，業主與經理，孰小暗中盤算，如何節省開支，如何辭减夥計？吹毛求疵而去之，執法如山而去之，其因營業衰落而難維原狀者更大刀闊斧而去之；全市因此而陸續失業者，當難勝計。近者，電力公司復實行逐步减少電力之供給，行見依恃電力之工廠、不得不减少工作，不得不减少工人；全市小將因此而有整批之失業者乎？此實危象之尤也。凡此危象，誠非一手一足之烈所得挽救；然明達之工商界，鑒此危機，不應各就本位，圖謀共濟之道乎？姑莫謂共濟，至少亦應相勗相戒，如何異於市儈而勿助長危機乎？</p>
<p>負有維繫全市職責之租界當局其注意之乎？危機深刻之甚，租界當局其勿太自菲薄，其勿太自原諒：曰權限也，曰環境也，誠非推諉之談，界內居民聞之熟聞之，知之深知之矣；然數年以來，居民在艱難萬狀之中，所予租界當局之合作，亦不謂不厚。當局固將如何與居民合作乎？居民以華籍居絕對多數，其間有大惡；其勿優容大惡之所爲，曰華人自已猶不相恤，放縱之可也；曰大惡旣能活躍於絕對多數之間，合作之可也。凡此云云，我人髯願所云之爲無的放矢，不願所云之談言微中。然租界當局之必虛懷自檢，必須爲絕對多數謀福利，必須與絕對多數相合作，此則我人確信爲當局所應採行之鐵則。如何爲福利與合作？如關於電力供給之减少問題，傳聞「將來對於公衆用電供給量之核减，應比减於消費事業者爲少之一層，可望一致同意」，此誠適應絕對多數居民之福利，我人願於將來歌頌之。然種種暗中阻撓與公開詭辯之來，當局應於現在預防之。如謂消費事業有關捐稅之收入也，有關市面之繁榮也，有關市民生活之調劑也，有關消費業者之生計也，豈非皆可據爲並不嚴格的澈底的儘量的减供消費之論據。殊不知多一分無聊之消費，即少一分正當之力量；於是而生產受影響，工人受影響，由失業問題因此益趨嚴重而整個上海受影響。如關於米糧問題，當局從未調查公表存糧與陸續進口之實况；旣不聞證實存米一百數十萬石之說，對米蠹作有效之制裁，亦不聞更正此說，以促居民共爲之計。當局若謂有難言之苦衷，居民自無從相諒而甘消怨憤。公衆所感想者：百物貴由於米貴，生活難由於米貴，失業苦由於米貴，一切推源於米；而租界當局則一切賢明，一切忠誠，一切有辦法有權威，除關於米！事理雖未盡然，羣情確是如此。</p>

<h3>金市大戶觀望　多係搶帽子交易</h3>
<p>昨現金烚赤暗市上落、似較前昨爲狹、論潛勢則尚堅穩、本日始終浮游於六千三百元以上、晨初一度因合盛·大豐等賣出、由六千三百六十元高價、退至六千三百十元、午收則又盤旋平定、後毫無精彩、交易轉稀、大致因外匯趨向不定、經營者多係搶帽子買賣、大戶觀望以待、晚收價爲六千三百三十一元、比上日軋低一元、全日交易約一萬五千兩、現金步見下挫、永豐餘出聯與二十兩、照期交價高四百七十元、銀樓幫互做二十兩、高四百六十元、下午成記出五十兩、鳳祥和記出三十兩、由順源買進、高四百四十元、首飾金低十元、爲六百九十元、</p>
<p>烚赤無大起伏</p>

<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、掛低十元，計大同行懸六百九十元、新同行與上價彷彿、收進减低四十元云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債趨勢沉悶</h3>
<p>公債培盤、昨日市况復父盤旋帶疲、行市之一再醞釀、交易亦因之無起色、人氣仍極懈怠、趨勢頗爲沉悶、暫時尚不易打開此僵局、昨日市價、上午稍疲、同康略有抵補、仁昌·仁豐·繼續買進、聯益亦稍有需要、鴻大·聯和·賣出乙種較多、協康·久豐·賣出丙種三十五萬、又賣出丁種、市價乃微疲、午後交易已稀、仁昌·仁豐·仍有吸收、聯和補回、三開略有胃量、長太·協大·聯益·信昌·賣出、結果一律回小一角至二角半、成交約計一百萬元有奇、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　雜紗銷塲停頓　雙馬形勢日虛</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、形勢甚虛、此因銷路狹隘、各方運輸遭受重大打擊、所以人心不振、多方雖竭力掙扎、然空頭依然活躍、因之紗市仍在疲境中、目前市塲之情形、多空皆有相當的力量也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千三百七十五元、低價爲一千三百三十七元、午後初做一千三百六十三元、跌至一千三百四十六元、最後價爲一千三百五十一元、今日出口、有棉紗一千二百六十件、運往香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日暗盤回高、人心尙堪支持、首盤價爲一千三百七十五元、旋以買戶未見踴躍、徐徐而下、同時客銷呆滯如恒、跌至一千三百六十元、但外滙稍縮、及標金穩定、一時人氣尚好、詎料雜牌紗因銷塲停頓、氣勢大虛、引起有一部份套出雙馬、市盤乃逐步下降至一千三百三十七元、嗣後盈利者扒空、又復回好至一千三百五十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬〇〇六十五包、茲將各幫口貿去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉市滯鈍不堪</h3>
<p>現棉情况、益見不佳、良以大衆意見、爲紗銷不起、廠方需要停頓、所以市態十分滯鈍也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因有同業買進、及棉布貿易良好之關係、市况靜而堅、結果收盤價格、較之上日約漲一二磅音、</p>
<p>印棉平疲、先因投機買進而漲、再因多頭了結回跌、昨日連同預測低落一羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、仍在逡巡不進之狀態下、偶有零星之買賣、聊此點綴而已、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布搜現套利</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢平定、市價盤旋、蓋以粵幫心思淡薄、購進之貨頗有轉賣、惟同業及囤戶尙多堅持、故跌風已轉緩和、後市且稍見回昂、富貴細布晨開跌二角半、售四十二元、午刻續跌二角半、而後市仍回上二角牛、粗布斜紋價亦微軟、漂染布價不動、本街成交各布二百餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布粗細布七八十件、閩幫辦色布色斜等近百件、北路烟津幫辦府綢粗布色布五六十件、今日有疋頭三百二十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　先跌後回、結果細布現貨續降每疋五角至七角半、而取引所龍頭期貨本月份收盤仍四十六元叫角、與上日相等、市塲龍頭棧單最小價跌至四十四元三角、下午則人心轉好、散囤搜現套利、逐步抬高至四十五元六角半、四君子嗶嘰始終較堅、小至一元二角七分半、進多出少、又回至一元二角九分半收盤、</p>

<p>開平烟煤、邇來因產地來源已有限制、致到貨日缺、求過於供、日來電力公司搜羅烟煤、該貨亦爲帶上、經理某公司却已停止打單、致暗盤更形奮騰、同業行拆、開平塊每噸兩百五十五元、開平二號屑一百八十元、棧房　貨、行槓外加、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛鐵交易通暢</h3>
<p>靑鉛鐵　有會司貨與雙連板二種、其用途大多製坯、如熱水瓶廠製罐廠等皆有搜納、唯最近因海外來源告絕、而本街號家存貨欠豐、且廠家用量又如是宏大、逐日交易堪稱通暢、致行情帶高、刻會司貨二百元、雙連板二百二十元、</p>
<h3>馬鈴薯</h3>
<p>— 高創農</p>
<p>在從新大陸普及到全世界的幾種植物當中，——日前已談過菸草和金鷄納樹，——要算馬鈴薯是最有益於人的了。它的祖國是南美洲的智利和秘魯，本包括四十多種，現在人還能在它的故鄉遇到它野生的同伴呢。當公元一五三一年，西班牙的拓地家比撤羅（Francisco　Plzarro）。率領着一羣粗鄙無識的兵卒和商人，在古印加帝國——現在的秘魯——登陸的時候，他們到處遇見這滋味甘美的塊莖植物，就是馬鈴薯，還有甘薯。不過甘薯是在炎熱的平原沃野到處叢生着的，而馬鈴薯則只繁盛在寒溫氣候的高山地帶。那些不學無術的西班牙人，恣意的摧殘破壞古印加帝國的文明，可是見了滋養料豐富的塊莖植物，也不能不軟化下來「刀下留情」了。一個曾在比撤羅手下服務，留居秘魯十七年，也曾寫下秘魯編年的名叫POiega　de　Leon的人，在一五五〇年第一次記述馬鈴薯的踪跡時，稱它的名字爲Papas，後來許多人沿用這名。至於它的拉丁學名叫Solanumtuberosum，法文名宇叫「地蘋菓」（Pommede　terre），則是一七一六年時，一個名叫Prezier的平常工程師，遊歷南美，作了一部智利秘魯遊記，纔第一次用道名字稱呼它，想不到竟普遍的在法國沿用起來了。我國稱它爲馬鈴薯，當然是因爲它形狀像似馬鈴，叉有洋山芋，山藥等稱呼，則是各地的方言了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>今日國際婦女節　婦女節砥礪忠貞　發表宣言闡明偉大意義　繼續推行節約獻金運動</h3>
<p>今日爲「三八」國際婦女節、滬市婦女界、以抗建時代、婦女職責重大、一致注軍精神策勵、並努力本位工作、從思想上遵守新生活運動禮義廉恥的精神信條、從行動上履行國民精神總動員綱領所規定之國民誓約、艱苦奮鬥、再接再厲、以爭取整個國家民族之自由平等、實現婦女解放目的、並繼續推行節約獻金、彙呈當局、轉發各地慰勞、今日各婦女團體除舉行簡單集會、以表慶祝外、並決聯電最高領袖曁前方、代表全市二百萬婦女、表示懇切敬意、又聞此間某婦女團體、並於今日發動籌備一婦女圖書館、以紀念本年勝利之「三八」婦女節其意義殊爲重大、茲覔得本市婦女界所發之宜言、特撮錄要義如次、</p>
<p>精神紀念　偉大節日</p>
<p>親愛的諸姑姊妹們、全世界光榮的「三八」紀念日、今日又來臨了、我們處在黑暗勢力籠罩下的孤島上、對於這個切身的偉大紀念日、不能喊一聲口號、不能貼一張標語、不能作一次游行、不能開一個盛會、這不是我們已經忘了這個有重大實義的紀念日、只是被壓迫着在形式上暫且休止罷了我們的精神却無時不與抗建的國策連繫着而紀念着的、</p>
<p>婦運工作　職責綦重</p>
<p>在「三八」節的前奏新生活運動七週年紀念日、蔣委員長在廣播訓詞中指示出「推進婦女運動」、爲本年度主要工作之一、由於賢明領袖的重視婦運工作、使我們更覺得所負責任的重大、我們因爲環境的惡劣、今年此日、不能有所行動、但精神方面正該有所惕勵、</p>
<p>保持純潔　革除奢靡</p>
<p>今年是勝利年、眼看抗建大業快要完成、然而在黎明將到來的大黑暗時期、我們要厲行下列的五項原則、（一）養成純潔的品格、不問環境如何惡劣、我們耍始終抱定「富貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、威武不能屈、」的志操、保守我們「出汚泥而不染」的純潔品格、（二）革除奢廳的風尚、我們該取消無謂的餽贈、無謂的宴會、及一切超過生活所需的費用、而移作各種獻金、和救助難胞、</p>
<p>提高知識　努力生產</p>
<p>（三）提高知識的水準、己、鍛鍊自己、在學婦女固然應該如此、便是家庭婦女、職業婦女、也該在家政業務之餘、多方搜集精神食糧、以求知識水準的提高、（四）陶鑄自立的習性、我們不應該貪安逸而逃避工作、放棄工作、要在社會上成一個生活的女性、在家庭裹成一個分責的成員、</p>
<p>爭取未來　光榮地位</p>
<p>（五）爭取光榮的地位、全國婦女、自從作戰以來已經直接間接忍受了不少的犧牲、前方後方參加了不少的工作、在此迎取勝利的「三八」節、我們更耍加緊努力、以我們的成績、爭取將來永久光榮的地位、</p>
<p>國家至上　民族至上</p>
<p>總而言之、我們對於今年的「三八」節、感覺着具有特別重大的意義、因爲在我們的眼前、已經閃耀着希望的曙光、不過我們耍認淸、「三八」國際婦女節、乃是爭取婦女解放的節日、而耍爭取婦女的解放、須先爭取民族國家的解放、所以我們應該結集於國家至上民族至上的目標之下、戳力奮鬥於爭取抗建勝利·民族解放·的大業、</p>
<p>破壞統一　痛予打擊</p>
<p>而且、我們還須認淸、在最後勝利快耍到來的今天、尚有若干甘心不惜破壞統一的敗類、憑着國際背景、直接間接地助紂爲虐、或中途背叛抗建、這些民族罪人、我們婦女界、也應該予以最有力的打擊、一方面擁護政府關於整飭軍紀的賢明政策、一方面要肅淸騎牆國民的國際至上主義以及和平的謬論、這樣、我們才可以達成抗肆的大業、而獲得婦女的解放、</p>
<h3>救世軍捐款　將達廿萬</h3>
<p>救世軍馬立師放長稱、藏至昨日止、已收到捐款達國幣十八萬二千元左右、不久可達廿萬元之數、據稱昨日有熱心救濟事宜之中國商人一名單獨捐助一萬元、如有捐助者、請送至南京路四十號沙遜大樓救世軍總部、捐助多寡均所歡迎、</p>
<h3>高二分院長被綁後　由郭雲觀暫代</h3>
<p>江蘇高等第二法院院長徐維震、於本月四日下午公畢、與夫人同車駛返華龍路楊氏公庽、被預伏腐前之匪徒綁架去後、迄無消息、自此事發生後、該院院務仍照常進行、並請呈司法行政部請示、茲該院已接奉部令、關於院長一職、暫令第一特區地方法院院長郭雲觀兼代、該院四週戒備、更爲嚴密、即特一法院亦戒備不少鬆弛、</p>
<h3>英美澳荷集中力量　保衛整個南洋　打破政治畛域統一海空實力　四國實行聯防足禦任何侵略</h3>
<p>太平洋上密佈緊張氣氛、局勢演進、自堪注意、但玩火者終將延及自身、由於侵略者亟圖南進、致形成美英澳荷之新集團國家、萬一日本企圖南進、其所遭遇者、非爲荷印·澳洲·或美央各個單獨國家、而將爲該四國一體堅强集團、此間外籍觀察家、曾對太平洋形勢、作透切之研究、</p>
<p>美國實居　領導地位</p>
<p>體稱法國屈降以後、太平洋主要國家、僅餘英·美·澳·荷·四國、英國凶歐戰關係、未能用主力照顧遠東、但澳英原爲一體、澳洲在經濟與軍事上、不失爲目前太平洋時局中一個重要因素、而荷蘭對英、允充份合作、惟居於領導地位者、首推美國、無論精神與物質觀點而言、美國未來命運、實不能與太平洋須臾隔離、</p>
<p>道義權益　均須維護</p>
<p>簡言之、美國在物質上、需耍亞洲所產之錫·橡皮·及其他鑛產、而商務上美國在亞洲南部具有每年五萬萬美金以上之貿易、與幾萬萬元之投資、在政治上言、美仍負有保護遠東僑民利益、以及菲島一千六百萬人口之義務、精神上而言、允不能放棄九國公的與非戰公的等道義上之責任、現在美國第一道國防綫、在歐者、爲英國之海軍、其在遠東者、即中國之作戰、是以對英國與中國之援助、將以全力爲之、預料租賃法案一旦通過後、美國對中英之協助、益將認眞、太平洋有事、美國將退讓說、實不河能也、</p>
<p>英美澳荷　一個集團</p>
<p>現在太平洋上侵略勢力煎迫、局勢較前益爲重大、致英·美·澳·荷趨向一個集團、形成堅强不破堡壘、打消南洋整個政治區域、而南洋在策略上、北起香港、南迄澳洲·紐西蘭、東由馬尼刺之坎維特、西至新加坡、其中更包含爪哇之泗水·巴達維亞之潭疆·普里阿克港、此廣大之區域、將聲氣相求、互形成犄角之勢</p>
<p>海軍實力　異常堅强</p>
<p>現在美磋商使用美洲和紐西蘭海軍根據地、異日進一步利用新加坡、亦屬可能、美最近改編海軍、遠東艦隊、獨樹一幟、益有擴充可能、如美國由夏威夷派艦至菲島、均爲未雨綢繆、荷印現有巡艦三艘、驅逐艦八八艘、潛艇一隊、佈雷與掃雷艦各八艘、空軍一千架、英國如地中海形勢好轉、未嘗不可撥部份艦隊東來、</p>
<p>空軍威勢　無可忽視</p>
<p>至於空軍實力重要、就菲島言、有機塲白餘處、荷印至少有一二十處、馬來亞不相上下、菲島並設有精良軍用機塲、美空軍在菲島實力、頗有日新月異之勢、澳空軍先後飛抵新加坡、是以新加坡亦成爲重耍空中堡壘、允可注意者、英國遠東總司令樸芳氏、本人即爲空軍元帥、英·美·澳·荷·四團空軍實力、以質量言、絕不亞於日本，即以荷印空軍實力言、現集中在泗水者、自一九三三年至三六年、曾向美國購有三百架、一九三八年輸入者三百十八架、另有新機竟達一千二百架、荷印距新加坡僅四小時之海程、飛機可於四十分鐘內到達、</p>
<p>日如南進　前途可知</p>
<p>據此吾人可知、英·美·澳·荷四國之聯防、大有可能、綜觀以上情勢、可以判定、萬一南進不發動武方則已、苟一旦甘冒不韙、而其所遭遇者、將爲英·美·澳·荷·四國一體之新集團、則其泥足、禁不起二次蹉跌、所以南進云云、正爲切腹問題也、</p>
<h3>捷故總統誕辰　捷僑慶祝</h3>

<p>按馬薩里克總統以一八五〇年誕生、本晨人子、抱百折不回之奮鬥精神、終成捷克最受人愛戴之人物、一九一八年至三五年任總統、而於德國開始侵略捷克前一年即一九三七年之九月十四日溘然長逝、世界大戰時、馬薩里克曾廣游協的各國、一九一八年春亦曾來中國與日本、盤桓若干星期、</p>
<h3>新普育堂　繼續捐款</h3>

<h3>昨晨鬧市搶米　同孚路上大隊貧民搶去四包</h3>
<p>昨晨八時半、有某咪好老虎車、車送白米八包赴某處、車經靜安寺路同孚路口時、突有大隊貧民攔住去路、用小刀割破米袋、攫奪白米、一時路中秩序大亂、車夫無法、高聲呼警、迨附近崗捕聞訊到來、白米已被搶去四包、而一般貧民亦已紛紛作鳥獸散、事後經老虎車夫據情報告某米號、轉報捕房請究、</p>
<p>改善米市　昨有議案</p>
<p>工部局糧食委員會爲商討穩定民食、特於昨日下午二時半、假工部局一樓議事廳、舉行全體委員會議、全體委員均出席、由馬歇爾氏主席、至四時始散、大中社記者於會議後、曾向工部局情報處探詢詳情、因議案尚在整理中、故未能予以發表、惟據一般推測、該會對改善米市之各項辦法、已有決議、</p>
<p>麵粉平售　下週續辦</p>
<p>關於平賣麵粉一事、前因福新廠停工關係、曾自二月十八日起、停止供給、以致平價麵粉、暫停發售、茲悉經工部局屢次與福新廠接洽之結果、該廠已允自今（八）日起、每日仍照常供給五·八七三包、每包售價廿五元、外加粉號手續費三角、以售完廿五萬包爲止、上項售價、雖較前略增、但比目下市價、每包低廉數元、該廠爲調劑粉市起見、慨允繼續供給、其熱心公益、殊堪嘉許、又悉阜豐廠因原料奇絀、無法製粉、故平價麵粉、已暫停供給、至於發售平價麵粉事宜、自下星期一起、仍可恢複辦理、即各用戶可於每星期一·二·四·五·六等五天、按照應領數額（每天共計八·三一八包）、向原領粉號領粉、（星期三及星期日不發粉）、以後倘有不足情事、當以洋粉提成所得之數補充之、按洋粉提成平賣價格、因新訂廠盤爲每包廿五元、故亦改爲每包廿五元云、</p>

<h3>工部局董事會通過　經委會報吿書　音樂隊存廢取決納稅人　倫敦紐約代理人暫保留　擴充稅源應使領照者無從逃稅</h3>
<p>工部局經濟委員會之最後報告書、已由工部局董事會於三月五日會議中予以通過、此項報告、包括調查工部局音樂隊之支出、及倫敦·紐約·代理人之支出、此外尚有關於稅源小組會各種活動之情形、內容如下、</p>
<p>樂隊存廢</p>
<p>一查工部局音樂隊、爲以少數市政基金所支助文化事業之一、吾人考慮該音樂隊之賬目、及其一五四一年度三十七萬八千五百四十元之預算後、認爲該音樂隊之組織、甚爲　濟、此項娛樂、新欲繼續予以維持、則此項預算、實已無法减少、但此項組織之是否需要、其權操諸納稅人之手、故吾人認工部局所應採之政策、爲應向納稅人徵求同意、是否應維持該樂隊之組織</p>
<p>代理酬報</p>
<p>關於倫敦代理人之支出一項、工部局最近甚爲注意、自一五四〇年一月一日起、倫敦代理人之支出、已大事核少、就現狀而論、此等代理人未伸遽予裁撒、則其酬報、亦不能冉事减少、因工部局現有若干英籍享受養老金者、及若干英籍職員、故此等代理人實爲不可少者、將來如果環境改變、則工部局不妨中止此等倫敦與紐約代理人之職務、</p>
<p>擴充稅源</p>
<p>稅源小組會之活動、已盡在此間短之第二報吿中、此項報告專論及工部局之增加照會費問題、吾人認爲自一九四一年之財政年度起、工部局必須獲得額外之基金、目下工部局之稅收、不外乎地捐·房捐·與廣告捐、以及照會費與碼頭捐等、據小組會之調查，工部局在地皮章程規定下所有之徵稅收、甚爲有限、僅上述各種捐稅而已、小組會對於工部局照會費之收入、將加以充分之檢討、務使應納照會費之地方、無從逃稅、工部局徵稅之成本、已由一九三一年百分之三·二六减至一九四〇年百分之二·五五、小組會巳檢騐工部局稅務處之情形、覺其有效而經濟之工作、頗能使人滿意」、</p>
<h3>節减電流供給量　用戶均應合作　大量用戶不應藉口提高物價　節减電量旨在預防共同損失</h3>
<p>關於工部局核准之臨時减電辦法、各方一致稱許、惟所慮者、恐各大工廠、將藉口電費增加、抬高物價、昨日英文大美晚報對於　事、所能表評論、即係對電力大用戶、致其警告、原文云、</p>
<p>小量用戶　電費不增</p>
<p>據丁部局稱、上海電力公司用戶、其每月之用電量在一千度以上者、今後應將其用電量减少百分之三十、其超過部份、則按照收費率收取等於一倍之費、此項辦法、殊値我人之贊許、因此係專對能負担損失之大用戶而發、對於目下負担已極重之小用戶、不擬再加以任何負担、此舉實行後、雖將遭致若干不便、然目下若冉不取辦法加以糾正、則大用戶所受之損失、將較目下所受者更見重大也、然大用戶若因超過用電限制、致受三倍之罰金、而圖假禍他人、將物價提高、使最後之消費者蒙受損失、則工部局此舉之目的、將被打破、我人因上述理由、希望工部局深信公共租界之居民、能與其採取合作態度、同時若有人竟敢冒大不韙、不願與此項目的在謀全租界人士福利之良舉採取合作行動、則我人將共棄之云、</p>
<p>减電以後　所受影響</p>
<p>據工業界人士稱、王部局實行减電辦法後，本市各工業、除極少數以外、莫不受車大之影饗、其中受損失最大者、則爲上海之日商紗廠、據過去調查所得之結果、日本工廠所消耗之電流、約二萬五千萬度、約佔上海電力公司電流供給量總額之半數、日方雖因此舉對日商工業有重大之影響、嘖有煩言、然衆信日方不致提出有力之抗議、本市工業界人士深信、該項新辦法實行後、各工廠之生產程序及勞資關係、必將有若干調整、</p>

<h3>疼痛對於社會的影響</h3>
<p>疼痛有時候給予我們很多的麻煩，當我們有一點疼痛的時候，我們　曾做出　　得决　，在當業上　　嚴重的損失，　　在集會的時候，不能把意見發表。至於在社交界中，那是更有損害了，在約定的時候，不得不臨時取消我們的約會。</p>

<h3>聾了耳的爸爸</h3>
<p>— 謝宜龍</p>
<p>以一個中學沒畢業，早年聾了雙耳的人，來支持一個十幾口的家庭，那就是我的爸。</p>
<p>我們有八個兄弟姊妹，八張貪吃的口，每天喝着爸的心血。爸在二十歲上聾了耳，據說是因爲太用功的緣故。眞的，那時，白天在銀行裏做練習生，晚間又得讀夜書，寫文稿，日積夜累地，以雙耳作了智識和生活的交換品。他聽到我出生時雄壯的啼聲，可是他已聽不到我牙牙學語的輕音了。</p>
<p>爸聾了耳，可是他絕不因此而灰心。他是一個樂觀的人，他有堅强的意志。耳聾更決定了他的前途，他因斷絕了外界的紛擾，更能專一於他的事業和求知。以他平日的人格，平日的信譽，他不但沒因耳聾而失業，更以謹慎和小心得到了人的信仰。</p>
<p>他不喝酒，他不抽烟，也不上戲院和舞塲，（耳聾對他的娛樂是有相當影響的）。假日，他喜歡同媽和我們上館子吃點心：而圖書館和公園，是他唯一的消遣塲所。</p>
<p>三十年來，我由獨子而成八個弟妹的長兄時，爸的辛勞也用不到我來訴吿。當人家在爸面前稱譽我們時，爸的微笑，溫暖了我們弟兄們的心。我們五兄弟都在求學，八弟還在吃乳，一切費用都由爸一人負擔。但他看了我們的成續單時，總快慰地忘了他付出的一筆龐大的學費。</p>
<p>爸時時有光明的期望和快樂的理想。他只不過四十歲，雖然看上去好像蒼老了一點。但他已是八個只知享受的兒女的父親了。</p>
<p>爸叫上縐紋，正是我們兄弟姊妹們生命的標誌。我們年年的生長着，爸的縐紋也年年的增加着。但他並不自己以爲年老，他的一顆前進向上的心，比靑年們來得更迫切。</p>
<p>爸不喜歡多說話，也不十分責備我們。可是我們却沒有撒嬌的弟妹。每人是另一人的模範，每人是另一人的兄姊，所以家庭中的空氣永遠是那麽和煦。</p>
<p>爸對別人很和氣，四隣沒有不稱譽爸的，同事們也很樂意幫他的忙。他吿訴我們：「謙遜對我們是不會有害的。」</p>
<p>爸常對我們說，假使他沒有我們這麽多的子女，他的財產也很可觀了，汽車洋樓都可有了。這是他的憤慨。他聳我們比財產更重視。他常常撫摩弟妹們的頭說：「孩子，你們就是爸唯一的財產，唯一的希望。」</p>
<p>爸自奉很儉，但對我們的要求是很少拒絕的。他常對媽說：「不要使孩了們的慾望常常受着打擊。」</p>
<p>我已二十歲了，我想到二十年前爸已自食其力來養活媽和我時，我覺得太慚愧了。除了自咎的熱淚外，我在這裏默瞞着爸健康。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>為教育辯護</h3>
<p>— 三</p>
<p>田徑先生因爲他學校裹的同學，在圖書館裏不守秩序，因此覺得「所謂敎育這玩意，也該到墳墓裏去憇憇了。」讀到這篇文章的人很多有引爲敎育憂的—尤其是一輩永遠看不淸事實的老爺們，我的舅舅就這樣對我說：「哼，這種敎育眞不是東西！」</p>
<p>其實，敎育該不該「到憤墓裏去憇憇」呢？我覺得這種感慨是多餘的</p>
<p>是的，上海的大學裏，十個圖書館有九個不比茶室遜一分。可是這不能說是敎育本身的失敗，這是敎育者的失敗啊！看，自由中國的學生的苦幹的精神，不是給我們很好的證明嗎？許多報章雜誌刊載着關於自由中國學生的生活情形，豈不是很明顯地吿訴我們，敎育並沒有失敗，正像科學平身沒有罪一樣，失敗的祗是敎育者而已。</p>
<p>田徑先生叉舉了個反證說：「有些公共圖書館—那里的閱覽者，以速中學也沒進過的小職員爲多，却靜得很。」這未免使人覺得田徑先生的思想簡單了。中學也沒進過的小職員，難道就可說他們沒有受過敎育了嗎？難道「受敎育」一定要打了鐘，在敎室內由敎授一章章的傳授的嗎？難道他們靜得很的看書，不是正在受敎育嗎？田徑先生豈不知道社會也是個大學嗎？要知道：任何事情祇軍形式不重實際是最要不得的，允其是敎育。田徑先生這樣着重形式，莫怪要爲「敎育這玩意兒」感慨了。</p>
<p>敎育的價値是不能衡量的，特殊環境下產生的不良現象，決不能把整個敎育埋葬掉，正像我們不能因侵略者的殺人放火，就結論人類是野蠻的動物一樣。</p>
<p>人生</p>
<h3>生命大廉價</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>偶爾翻閱舊日記——這是一部痛苦的記錄，一篇生命的支付賬——看到那最後一頁上寫着的話：</p>
<p>「生活像是一架榨床，又像是一座石磨，把我的生命壓成渣滓，把我的健康碾成奮粉，痛苦的忍受已達飽和點了！但痛苦已登峯造極，再也不能忍受下去的一類老調，也不知說了多少次了，然而結果像現在商店大廉價一般，說了決不展期結果還是展期。可是商店廉價多是虛僞的，我的生命廉價，却是眞正的犧牲血本，關店是遲早的問題了！在未關店之前一再展延的大廉價期中，流着那殘餘的血本，實在太可慘了！我也知道流盡了血本才關門，太不値得了，遲早要關門，何不趁早關了這生命之門呢？可是我原始的求生慾望在掙扎着，它顫慄地屛障那破殘的生命，不肯屈伏。於是我祇得繼續我的生命廉價，讓它流完最後的一滴血！」</p>
<p>殷紅的血似乎在我眼前淌，我一顆麻木不仁的心突然起了一陣震撼！這是我生命發出的哀號啊！我是多麼的殘忍，多麼的可愧！我不能衛護自己的生命，還想做自己的劊子手！動物都有天賦的自衛本能，人更是具有智慧的動物：你雖然失去了健康，因而不能走那較便捷的自衛途徑，但你可以運用你的智慧，發揮你的精神力量，曲折地，艱苦地來達到你自衛的目的。你得奮鬥，你不能讓你的血繼續流去，你應該維護你自己的生命，這是你的大職，也是爲了人道！</p>
<p>「人道是要各人竭力掙來，培植，保養的，不是別人佈施或捐助的。」記着！這文化戰士魯迅的遺言。（稿酬捐新普育堂）</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）　意外的遇合</p>
<p>「很好，請太太等我四五分鐘行不行？」秋海棠立刻從一件灰色大褂的衣襟上，取下了一支活動鉛筆來，又在日記簿上撕下兩頁白紙，馬上伏在一張圓桌上，開始揮寫起來。</p>
<p>至多不過六七分鐘，一段極淸楚而簡略的記錄已握在湘綺的手裏了；可是她看的時候，却足足費了十多分鐘。她看了好幾遍，竭力想尋出一些關於文字上或書法上的錯訛來，結果恰巧相反，只覺得句子的構造也好，書法也好，簡直什麼都好！</p>
<p>「這一個唱戲的人倒眞是很奇怪的！」她心裏暗暗這樣想。一面又禁不住向他看了一眼，可是不巧得很，向來最能自持的秋海棠今兒偏是也有些反常了，恰好也偷偷地斜眼過來看她；叫道視綫一接觸，立刻就發生了比電氣還快的反應，兩顆頭不由一齊低了下去。</p>
<p>「……」秋海棠很想再說幾句客氣話，可是無論怎樣也說不出了。</p>
<p>「好的，就是這樣吧！」湘綺始終還是保持着很端莊的態度，慢慢地打椅子上站起來，表示談話已經結束的意思。</p>
<p>「那末，請問太太，我們幾時可以來聽回話呢？」趙四來不及的問。</p>
<p>「明天下半天，」湘綺只看着海棠一個人說：「請你再到這裹來一次，我相信我是可以給你一個滿意的答復的。一</p>
<p>秋海棠帶着趙四走出袁家的時候，心思覺得非常的混亂，甚至比方才沒有來以前更混亂，路上始終不會和趙叫說過一句括。</p>
<p>「現在可以不用再愁了！」趙四再也想不出他爲了什麽事，反比人家沒有答應他幫忙以前更憂愁起來，便竭力勸慰着。「聽袁太太的話，我們是一定不會再吃虧了，至多給沈麻子幾個錢的傷費，不怕他再凶到那裹去！」</p>
<p>秋海棠像沒有聽見一樣，默默地從洋車上跨下去，走進旅館；一個女人的影子，已破天荒地佔據了他腦神經的全部。（四九）</p>

<h3>拉摩決心棄沙龍</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>「獸國女皇一所賜予她的痛苦</p>
<p>桃樂珊拉摩是憤然了，可是她並不擲去什麼，好像一匹獅子一樣，怒目而視，其初是遲慢的，兩眼發光，連續地抽吸捲烟，一口，兩口，三口，終於在烟霧迷漫中，滔滔不絕地發　了：</p>
<p>「當我踏　好萊塢，木擬演溫文爾雅的戲，在我的腦海裏，只想像着紙醉金迷的夜　會，暖氣的房間，在攝影塲的一角，神態愉然。然而所得到的是些什麽呢？我獲得了「獸國女皇」的牛角，在一個許多人同住的帳幕中，席地而坐，一連八日在冰雪交加的山澗　，這是好萊塢給我的款待！每天我遍體　塗着油彩，使我有着　種美好的日晒紫膚。晚上回到帳幕時，其餘的白餘工人都比我先到，結果使得我全天弄不到一點熱水，而中了油彩毒，寒熱交作，在醫院中臥病好久。</p>

<p>第一章　人生何處不相逢</p>
<p>鄉人說是在前面的小河裏，我就要他引導我去一觀。於是點了燈籠，向前邊河畔走去，到了那裏，祗有河水潺潺和野風吹捲林木的聲音。鄉人把手向前面相距的十步的河水中一指道：「你看這白光不是從那裏射出來的嗎？」我跟着他的手一看，果然隱隱的的有一絲白光從水面上騰至天空裏，更亮得多了，時常有躍躍欲動的樣子。我和鄉人站在水邊，觀看多時，那白光忽然漸漸收歛，淡得如游絲一般，幾乎看不見了。我們遂回到屋裹。鄉人對我說道：『恐怕這是金銀之氣，所以發生這樣的白光。』我就笑問道：『旣然河中有金銀，你們爲什麽不開浚呢？」他說他們有些不敢。我笑了一笑，各自安睡。但我想河中必有寳物，這個機會不可失去。於是到了明天，我託他找了幾個鄕人前來，帶了開掘的器具，一齊趕到河邊去。河水並不甚深，我敎他們先戽去了水，遏住了上流，然後動手挖掘。他們也以爲有金銀可取，欣然從命。挖掘得不多時候，一個鄉人手裏忽然摸得一樣東西，很快的跳上來給我看，原來就是那寳劍了。我就想起古時豐城劍氣的故事，我雖非雷煥，幸獲霜鋒，那麼夜間所見的白光，大概便是此物了。鄉人們再向下掘時，一些也沒有別的發見，垂頭喪氣的走上來說道：『那裏有什麼金銀？祗有這柄古劍，又有何用？』我心中暗暗歡喜，便賞給他們幾兩銀子，把這劍帶回家門，配了一個劍鞘，自己空瑕時舞舞，很是順手，這事豈非出於偶然的嗎？」張蒼虬道：「寳劍難得，被你道樣輕易得着，雖屬偶然，可喜可賀，俺旣然看了你的寳刀，俺也把寳刀給你一看何如？」他一邊說，一邊把赤風劍還給許靖手中。自己也將身邊佩帶的那柄寳刀拔出來，光耀寒霜，氣凛淸風，雙手托着給許靖看道：「此刀名靈寳，是魏曹丕所製，也有相當歷史。俺是從一個頭陀手裏得來的。」許靖看了，也說好刀好刀。一個兒托着寳刀，一個兒仗着寳劍，光森森地照耀四壁。他們正在欣賞之際，同時竹籬外面也有兩道銳利的目光正從　眼裏向窗邊射來，但是二人都沒有覺察。　（第一章完）</p>

<p>Chongqing, the 7th - Today was the seventh day of the first General Assembly of the National Council of Participating Governments. In the morning, various committee groups convened meetings to review proposals. At 1:00 PM, the seventh session commenced with 172 participating council members present, including Chen Shiquan. Over 30 heads of various government agencies were in attendance, including Kong Xiangxi and Wang Shijie. Chairman Zhang Boling presided, with Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu serving as recorders. Following customary procedures, the minutes of the sixth session were read. The secretariat then reported on the work of the Sichuan-Kang Development Preparatory Committee, along with over ten responses from the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the National Food Administration regarding inquiries. After the reports, the order of discussion proceeded. First, the presidium proposed the establishment of a drafting committee for the General Assembly declaration, along with proposals for the continued establishment of the National Council of Participating Governments' Sichuan-Kang Development Preparatory Committee and various offices. Both proposals were passed by the General Assembly. As for the drafting committee members, in addition to the presidium serving as ex-officio members, Zhang Zhizhang, Hu Jianzhong, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Bosheng were added as members, to be convened by the presidium. Subsequently, the review reports of the various committee groups were discussed. The first item discussed was the deferred deliberation from the previous day regarding the method of paying fees to postpone military service. After a brief report by the convener of the review committee, the General Assembly resolved that the government may collect a small fee for exemption certificates from those legally qualified for exemption or postponement of military service to fund the preferential treatment of families of soldiers on active duty. Next, the foreign affairs report review opinions and several military-related proposals regarding the improvement of military service administration were passed. As it was past 5:00 PM, the chairman announced a ten-minute recess. After resuming the meeting, several proposals were passed, including one to send condolences to overseas Chinese in the name of the General Assembly. Finally, a proposal by Councilor Kong Geng and 23 others was discussed, requesting the adjustment of the health administration structure, emphasizing both Chinese and Western medicine, gradually seeking integration, promoting national health, and benefiting the war effort. After a heated debate, a revised proposal was passed, namely: (1) The current health administration structure will not be changed, but the Committee of Chinese Medicine should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior. (2) The government should find ways to promote research in Chinese medicine. As it was already 6:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned. All participating council members went to the Jialing Guesthouse to attend a banquet hosted by the heads and deputy heads of the five Yuan (branches of government). It was reported that due to the large number of proposals, the General Assembly had decided to hold an additional session at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. The cases passed by the General Assembly on the 7th are selected as follows: (1) Councilor Shao Cong'en and 26 others proposed to improve the military service administration to benefit the war effort. It was resolved that this case be passed with amendments and sent to the government for earnest attention and improvement, and that the Central Military Service Inspection Group be instructed to conduct a serious investigation.

<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui stated during a response to inquiries at the National Council of Participating Governments that the visit of Dr. Crowley and others to China had yielded very satisfactory results. He stated that he had not yet received information about the rumored visit of Republican leader Wendell Willkie to China. Foreign Minister Wang also stated that China had been striving to establish diplomatic relations with Thailand in the past few years, but had not yet succeeded, and was continuing its efforts. The government, in view of Japan's intentions to advance southward, had already discussed the safety of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia with relevant countries.

<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the National Council of Participating Governments yesterday, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of repeatedly violating its promises made in 1937 to support the Three People's Principles and the National Government. Chairman Chiang emphasized that all national troops should obey military orders and strictly observe military discipline. The dissolution of the New Fourth Army was due to its violation of this principle. Chairman Chiang reiterated the importance of pacifying the internal situation while resisting foreign aggression, hoping that the military discipline issues of the Communist Party would be discussed and decided by the National Council of Participating Governments. He stated that the government would accept all suggestions offered by the National Council of Participating Governments, but only to the extent that they do not violate military orders, discipline, and the procedures for resisting aggression. The National Council of Participating Governments has decided to invite seven representatives of the Communist Party to attend and discuss how to resolve the disputes between the government and the Communist Party. The Central Daily News reported that Chiang stated in his speech, "Our country has only one army, which is the National Revolutionary Army. The National Revolutionary Army is the army of the state, and no other individual or party may have its own private army." Madame Soong Mei-ling also attended and listened to her husband's speech. This was the first time since the establishment of the National Council of Participating Governments in 1938. The Communist Party headquarters here told a United Press reporter that the Communist Party leaders and liaison officers had telegraphed the Communist Party Central Headquarters in Yan'an for instructions on whether to accept the invitation of the National Council of Participating Governments to attend.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Recent Panic</h3>
<p>In the past week, the lives of Shanghai citizens have been deeply and severely affected by the unwillingness of rice hoarders to sell on the market. Not only have the black market premiums for foreign rice emerged one after another and soared uncontrollably, but the prices of other daily necessities, such as flour, have exceeded 30 yuan at retail, and rice has exceeded 120 yuan. Even soap, matches, kerosene, and candles have all increased by 130% to 140%. What is the reason for this? It is not because there are no goods arriving; goods are indeed arriving in a steady stream. One often sees large vehicles speeding through the bustling city streets, heavily laden with rice, flour, oil, candles, firewood, and soap. It is also not due to the impact of currency values, as the exchange rate has remained stable or even slightly appreciated recently, with few devaluations. Therefore, it has no bearing on changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, it is not caused by citizens hoarding, as the current prices are so exorbitant, and living spaces are so cramped and simple that they are barely sufficient for daily life. Where would there be room for hoarding? Moreover, those who struggle to make ends meet, even with a few bushels of savings, are in dire straits. How could they have the extra capacity to hoard more? In essence, the current abnormal price surge is not due to a lack of supply, excessive consumption, or currency fluctuations. Instead, it is caused by the greedy and monopolistic practices of those who operate the businesses. They compete with each other, believing that storing goods is the best strategy, waiting for even better prices before selling. They would rather refuse current transactions to exploit future opportunities. Seeing the difficulty of purchasing goods, people rush to buy, fearing they will miss out. After repeatedly failing to find supplies, they cannot help but look at each other in dismay. Given this situation, those who care about the fate of the entire city of Shanghai should not overlook the panic that market traders have caused in recent days. It is important to understand that the level of panic today far exceeds the commonly heard complaints about rising prices and difficult living conditions.</p>
<p>Wise and experienced gentlemen of the business community, are you paying attention? Those greedy and unscrupulous merchants are beyond reasoning with or arguing with. Why not quietly observe the current market conditions? It is no longer the so-called abnormally developed market situation of the past two or three years. Instead, it is definitely trending towards decline and approaching exhaustion. Not only has the volume of goods actually sold decreased sharply, but the amount of money actually collected after the dramatic price increases has also gradually fallen. This is a serious crisis. How many businesses and families can still boast of a bustling clientele? Those who hesitate at the door must have needs, but when they see the high prices, they turn away. What business is immune to this, and what place is immune to this? Furthermore, consider the internal situation of each industry. Business owners and managers are secretly calculating how to save expenses and reduce staff. They find fault to dismiss employees, and they enforce rules strictly to dismiss them. Those who can no longer maintain their original state due to business decline are making even more drastic cuts. As a result, the number of unemployed people in the city is undoubtedly staggering. Recently, the power company has begun to gradually reduce electricity supply, which will inevitably force factories that rely on electricity to reduce production and lay off workers. Will this lead to a mass unemployment of the city's small-scale businesses? This is indeed a particularly serious crisis. All these crises cannot be averted by the efforts of one or two individuals. However, aware of this crisis, the enlightened business community should not each just stick to their own positions. Should they not seek ways to help each other? Even if they do not help each other, they should at least encourage and warn each other, how can they be different from the market traders and not exacerbate the crisis?</p>
<p>The concession authorities, who have the responsibility of maintaining the entire city, are they paying attention? The crisis is so deep that the concession authorities should not underestimate themselves too much, nor should they excuse themselves too much. The excuses of limited authority and difficult circumstances are not mere shirkings of responsibility. Residents within the concessions have heard them often and know them well. However, over the years, residents have cooperated with the concession authorities to a significant extent despite facing countless difficulties. How will the authorities cooperate with the residents? Chinese residents account for the vast majority of the population, and there are some who are extremely evil. One should not tolerate the actions of the extremely evil, thinking that Chinese people do not care for each other, so it is permissible to indulge them, or that the extremely evil can be active among the vast majority, so cooperation is possible. All these claims, we hope, are unfounded, and we do not wish to imply anything specific. However, the concession authorities must be open to self-examination, must work for the benefit of the vast majority, and must cooperate with the vast majority. This is what we firmly believe should be the iron rule adopted by the authorities. How to achieve welfare and cooperation? Regarding the reduction of electricity supply, there are rumors that "the amount of electricity supplied to the public in the future should be reduced by a smaller percentage than that supplied to commercial enterprises, which is expected to be unanimously agreed upon." This would indeed serve the welfare of the vast majority of residents, and we are willing to praise it in the future. However, the authorities should now take precautions against various covert obstructions and overt sophistries. For example, it may be argued that commercial enterprises are related to tax revenue, the prosperity of the market, the regulation of citizens' lives, and the livelihoods of commercial operators. Are these not all reasons that can be used to argue that there should not be a strict, thorough, and maximum reduction in the supply of electricity to commercial enterprises? Little do they know that every extra bit of frivolous consumption reduces legitimate power. As a result, production is affected, workers are affected, and the unemployment problem becomes more serious, ultimately affecting the entire city of Shanghai. Regarding the rice problem, the authorities have never investigated and publicly announced the actual situation of rice reserves and continuous imports. They have neither confirmed the claim of having over 1.1 million piculs of rice in storage and effectively cracking down on rice weevils, nor corrected this claim to encourage residents to plan together. If the authorities claim to have unspeakable difficulties, residents will have no way to sympathize and will continue to resent them. The public feels that the high prices of all goods are due to the high price of rice, the difficulty of living is due to the high price of rice, unemployment is due to the high price of rice, and everything can be traced back to rice. Meanwhile, the concession authorities are all wise, sincere, and capable, with the power to do everything except deal with rice! Although the situation may not be entirely like this, this is definitely the public's sentiment.</p>
<p>In times of hardship and danger, those who experience hardship and danger will naturally make more and stricter criticisms. This is what is called unavoidable human nature. We are unwilling to further fuel the irresponsible and inaccurate criticisms. However, the enlightened business community should set a good example, and the responsible concession authorities should urgently seek effective actions to reassure the vast majority of residents who are in hardship and danger, stabilize public morale, and reduce panic. This is something that cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Material Aid to China More Active Than Before; China Receives Large Quantities of Military Supplies; Road Transport Also Accelerated</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A high-ranking government official told a United Press reporter today that in the past few months, Soviet material aid to China has not only not decreased as rumored abroad, but has actually increased significantly. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, who has visited Moscow several times since the outbreak of the war, told a United Press reporter that the amount of military supplies China ordered in its latest purchase alone was greater than what China had previously received from the United States. President Sun explained that when the Soviet-Finnish War first broke out, Soviet aid to China had decreased slightly, but the reason for this was easily understandable. The Soviet Union had learned lessons in the war against Finland and was manufacturing new types of aircraft and military equipment. Soviet-style aircraft were at a disadvantage against Japanese-style aircraft, so China did not need these Soviet aircraft. However, since November of last year, the situation has changed, and China is now receiving more supplies than before. The transportation of this large quantity of supplies was affected by the inconvenience of road transport during the winter, but it has now been accelerated. President Sun also stated that all Soviet aid is delivered directly to the central government. Only some medical supplies are delivered directly to the Communist Eighth Route Army, which were transported to Yan'an about a year ago. It is very difficult to transport tea to the Soviet Union to repay Soviet loans because it is many times more difficult than usual, but the government is fulfilling its obligations as usual, despite the difficulties.

<p>Sun Ke's Talk with Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>Chongqing - Dr. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, told a United Press reporter today that if the Japanese navy still dominates the East China Sea, then any so-called Sino-Japanese peace is actually "Japan's peace." He explained that China's victory in the war against Japan is linked to the victory of the global anti-aggression war. China's purpose in fighting is to ensure that all aspects of China's national existence are not restricted by Japan, and not just to drive Japanese troops out of China. China's leaders have this responsibility and are determined to fight to achieve this goal. However, if the Japanese navy can still completely control the Asian coast, then this goal can never be achieved. As long as the Japanese navy remains dominant, no peace that is concluded can be maintained for long. Finally, he said that he believed that the annihilation or neutralization of the Japanese navy depended on the United States' participation in the world war. China's true leaders, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly understand the necessity of the aforementioned purpose of the Chinese war and are fully aware of the great disadvantages of negotiating peace, so they are all determined to continue fighting.

<h3>Japan and the Dutch East Indies to Hold Negotiations Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesman Ishii announced today that representatives of Japan and the Dutch East Indies will begin formal economic negotiations in Batavia next week. Ishii also stated that economic negotiations between Japan and France have been held in Tokyo at the same time as the Thai-Vietnamese peace talks, but the time required has exceeded the original expectations.

<h3>British Merchants Face Increasing Difficulties Due to Japanese Exclusion</h3>
<p>London - Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons yesterday that British merchants wishing to sell imported goods directly to customers in occupied areas of China are facing increasing difficulties. He could not say whether this was happening everywhere. Conservative MP Kerr asked whether the British government had made representations to the Japanese government, given that this move violated the Open Door Policy. Butler replied that representations had been made repeatedly on such matters, and the entire issue was being kept under consideration. Conservative MP Hannah asked whether Britain was handling this matter jointly with the United States. Butler replied, "We are always handling it jointly with the United States." Kerr also asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware that in occupied areas of China, the expenses of the Japanese army were largely covered by taxes paid by Japanese companies established under the supervision of the army, and that exports from occupied areas must pass through transport routes monopolized by Japanese companies. He asked whether the British government intended to take action to prevent the imposition of heavy taxes on British merchants. Butler replied that he could only reiterate what he told the House of Commons on February 26, namely that the trade and exchange system established by the Japanese favored Japanese merchants, and the British government was paying close attention to the impact this was having on British trade.

<h3>Thai-Vietnamese Compromise Diplomatic Procedures to be Completed Soon: French Side Fully Accepts Japanese Compromise Plan, New Boundaries to be Demarcated by Border Committee</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources, the conference to mediate the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which began a month ago, is expected to conclude smoothly today. Well-informed sources said that diplomatic procedures to achieve a complete compromise between the two sides this afternoon are expected to be completed this morning. As a result of three urgent meetings between Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the French ambassador to Japan, Henri, the French side fully agreed to the Japanese compromise proposal on Thursday, thus laying the foundation for signing an agreement to resolve the border dispute that has been ongoing since May. It is reported that the second extension of the Franco-Thai ceasefire, which expires at noon today, will not be "formally extended" again. Japan obtained assurances from both the Thai and French armies on Thursday that they would no longer engage in aggressive actions. On that day, Japanese representative Matsumiya and French representative Robin (former Governor of Vietnam), as well as Saito, Director of the South Seas Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and Thai representative Phisetsuratham (Thai Minister to Japan), held separate meetings and obtained the aforementioned assurances. The Hochi Shimbun reported that if France adopts a "lukewarm attitude" when discussing the remaining points regarding the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, in an attempt to delay the conclusion of the Tokyo talks, Japan will have no choice but to take a "tough stance and abandon its friendly attitude of respecting France's reputation" during the mediation. France should make every effort to expedite the conclusion of the Tokyo Conference before the ceasefire expires to show sincerity and avoid the resurgence of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. Although both sides have reached an agreement on the key points of Japan's proposal, the Japanese government still cannot be overly optimistic about the future of the Tokyo Conference. The Miyako Shimbun stated that the Tokyo Conference has passed a critical juncture, and Thailand and France have achieved their goals through mutual concessions, which is beneficial to both countries. France should appreciate Japan's fair attitude in the mediation, as this is the wise course of action. France should also cooperate with Japan to establish a new order and stabilize the situation in East Asia. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Seamen Strike Over Unfair Treatment, Subjected to Scrutiny</h3>
<p>London - Twenty-one Chinese seamen were convicted by the London Police Court for disobeying orders. The seamen appealed to the London Appeals Committee, which heard the case yesterday. The appeal was accepted for ten Chinese seamen who were sentenced to six months of hard labor, while the appeals of the remaining eleven, who were sentenced to one year of recognizance, were rejected. The plaintiffs' lawyer stated that when the seamen arrived in Hong Kong, they refused to work because they did not receive the £5 monthly allowance given to white seamen navigating dangerous waters, which they considered unfair. They were dissatisfied with their monthly pay of £3, which caused delays in the ship's schedule and disrupted the entire escort system. The defendant's lawyer, Hutchinson, stated that he was appearing on behalf of the Chinese Embassy. He said that the Chinese people are not only a civilized nation but also exceptionally brave and lively, and it is regrettable that they receive less compensation than white people. The matter has been raised in Parliament. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Matsuoka's European Visit Cannot be Confirmed</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Deputy Spokesman Ishii of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet today refused to confirm or deny reports that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka would travel to Moscow and Berlin on a diplomatic mission. Ishii also stated that he had no information about reports that German Ambassador to Japan, Ott, would return to Berlin. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Germany Lures Anti-German Youth in the Netherlands to Their Deaths</h3>
<p>London - Street brawls, strikes, sabotage, and organized insults against German troops have repeatedly occurred in the Netherlands, causing great distress to the German secret police. They have used the lure of "assistance to England" to entice out organizers of anti-German activities and arrest them. The Dutch government radio station in England has warned patriotic Dutch people not to fall for the tricks of the German secret police. The Free Netherlands newspaper, published in London, revealed the methods of the German police today. It is said that the German police have recently deliberately spread a message claiming that young people who wish to join the Dutch army in England can report to a certain rural area. There is a large lake in the area, and British seaplanes will land there to transport qualified volunteers to England. However, the German police have secretly set up ambushes, and any young people who appear are arrested and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Times on Soviet-Japanese Relations in the Far East: Soviet and Japanese Positions Have Reversed in Recent Years; Japan's Attempts to Appease the Soviets Are Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>London - The Times published a lengthy article on Soviet-Japanese relations in the Far East, stating that the current state of Soviet-Japanese relations began in the autumn of 1931, when Japan seized Manchuria in northeastern China. The Soviet Union was suspicious of Japan because Japan was willing to occupy eastern Siberia and northern Sakhalin Island, while Tokyo was concerned about the communist program and was also suspicious of the Soviet Union. However, before 1931, the two countries had no conflicts and were able to coexist peacefully. After the establishment of the Manchukuo puppet state, Japan wanted to secure the common border with the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, and the relations between the two countries were no longer as calm as before. Over six years, a total of 180 recognized incidents occurred. The most famous incident was the conflict on the Amur River in the early summer of 1937. The Soviet Union suffered a military defeat in this battle and had no diplomatic response. This weakness was probably due to the Soviet purges, and Japan saw this as an excellent opportunity to begin its major speculative actions in China. At that time, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed concluding a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, but Japan repeatedly refused. The Soviet Union even handed over the Chinese Eastern Railway under Japanese pressure. In addition to the repeated border disputes, fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters, which were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, were also a source of friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Soviet Union was not to be outdone and strengthened the defense of the Amur border, laid a double track on the Siberian Railway, strengthened its forces in the Far East, and built strong air force bases on Arctic islands. Since 1937, Japan has been engaged in China, and the military forces of the United States on the border have gradually become stronger than before. Although Japan wanted to prevent Soviet aid to China, it was ultimately unsuccessful. In the summer of 1939, the most intense and bloody battle of the Soviet-Japanese border war in ten years took place in Nomonhan. The Soviet Union won a great victory, which Japan also admitted. In these two months, the casualties in the small-scale war were no less than 18,000. In September of that year, a ceasefire agreement was reached, at which time the Soviet Union and Germany had already signed a pact, and the European war had broken out. From then on, Germany made great efforts to court Japan, hoping that the Soviet Union and Japan would become friendly. At this time, the Soviet and Japanese positions had already reversed, unlike a few years ago. It was the Soviet Union that had requested to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but now it was Japan. Japan agreed to reconsider the issue of fishing rights and was prepared to acknowledge the condition that it would not oppose Soviet aid to China, but the Moscow government held its head high and did not listen. The fundamental antagonism between the two powers in the Far East still exists today. Both sides have their strengths and weaknesses. Siberia is sparsely populated, especially in the east. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to defend, but the area is vast, and it is difficult for Japan to effectively occupy it. Japan certainly has the advantage in terms of its active and concentrated military strength, but it lacks the raw materials needed for war and is vulnerable to external resistance, and its famous cities are also vulnerable to air attacks. The Soviet Union cannot fight on both the eastern and western fronts at the same time. Although its pact with Germany is only a worthless guarantee in itself, its effectiveness as a source of supply for Germany is certainly its current shield in the West. As for the Soviet Union in the East, its strategic position is not enviable. Manchuria's terrain juts into Soviet territory like an ax head, forming a 2,000-mile border. The Soviet Union's coastal provinces are also quite far apart and have no ice-free ports. Japan has abandoned its old friendship with Britain and is pursuing a policy of open hostility to British commerce and interests in China. It has also created poor relations with the United States. If it were to start a war with the United States, it would inevitably use Korea, Manchuria, and North China as its bases. However, the conquered people living in the aforementioned places have never forgotten the opportunity to take revenge and make trouble for Japan. From a global perspective, the Soviet Union cannot seek peace with Japan, whose policy is based on the Tanaka Memorial. The Soviet Union's hope for commercial expansion lies in China, and for its commercial expansion, China must be free, friendly, and prosperous. The Japanese authorities have not lost their fear and dislike of communism. The existence of the Soviet Union will always be an obstacle to Japan's hegemony in China. Is this true fundamental antagonism between the two Asian powers not allowing them to approach each other? Will Stalin pursue a policy of appeasement towards Japan in exchange for temporary security and some tangible benefits in Asia, which is worth trying? This is an open question. As for the Soviet Union preventing Japan from advancing south, it is not possible to say. The Soviet Union has no motivation to encourage Japan to advance south and may even see the friction between Japan and the United States and Britain over the southern advance policy as beneficial to itself.

<h3>Soviet and Turkish Attitudes Determine the Safety of the Balkans: Turkish Troops Massed on Western Border, Ready to Repel German Attack</h3>
<p>Budapest - The government newspaper "Magyar Hirlap" here stated that the entire Balkan situation depends on the attitudes of Turkey and the Soviet Union. German troops could pressure Greece from Bulgaria after cutting off Albania and then deliver a fatal blow. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Budapest - It is reported that Turkey diverted thousands of troops from its border with the Soviet Union last night to the western border facing Greece and German-occupied Bulgaria. "The number of Turkish soldiers deployed in the Balkans is estimated to exceed 1,000,000." Turkey's new military actions are followed by a large fleet concentrated in the Dardanelles. Diplomatic circles here believe that this proves Turkey has taken a tough stance against German threats to Turkey and Greece, and may have obtained the consent of the Soviet Union. Sources in diplomatic circles indicate that Turkey will never allow German troops to freely pass through European Turkey or occupy the Bosphorus Strait. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the German military authorities, the entry of German troops into Bulgaria is not affected by heavy snow and rugged mountain roads. All troops have arrived at their designated locations according to the original plan. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>London - The Turkish radio station in Ankara announced last night that after German troops entered Bulgaria, they have now assembled a large army, using trains, trucks, and buses, to move towards the Bulgarian-Greek border. Germany wants to engage Britain in a place where it can fight Britain, so it is now looking for the weakest point in Britain's defense chain. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Sofia - General Lieutenant Rickert, commander-in-chief of the German forces in Bulgaria, arrived here yesterday and will stay for a short time. He was accompanied by German Minister Richthofen to meet with King Boris and Prime Minister Filov. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Rumor: Germany Proposes a Non-Aggression Pact to Turkey</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland - The "Basler Nachrichten" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Ankara stating that diplomats from neutral countries in Ankara believe that German leader Hitler's letter to Turkish President Ismet, in addition to providing assurances that Germany fully respects Turkey's territorial integrity, may have included a proposal for Germany and Turkey to conclude a non-aggression pact. As for the reply that Turkey should submit, it was discussed at a cabinet meeting yesterday, and it is likely to be sent to the German government today. Once it is delivered to Berlin, the Turkish government will issue a statement clarifying the situation. The Turkish government's intentions will then be seen in this reply. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Ankara - While political circles here await the start of the German spring offensive, they believe that the Soviet Union's attitude is now quite inclined towards Britain. Last night, Moscow Radio reiterated for the third time the Soviet Union's anger at Bulgaria's joining the Axis alliance. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler's recent letter to the Turkish President contains four points. The most important point is that Germany states that it urgently hopes that Turkey will send senior officials to Berlin, and Germany will also send senior officials to Ankara. The remaining points are (1) we recognize that Germany has designs on the Dardanelles Strait, (2) guaranteeing that Germany has no intention of invading Turkey, (3) a lengthy review of history since the Treaty of Versailles, criticizing Britain for luring and coercing small countries such as Turkey. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Ankara - It was announced today that the Turkish Cabinet will hold a meeting on Sunday, and Prime Minister Saydam will deliver a speech on Wednesday. It is reported that the above-mentioned authorities still hold a dismissive attitude towards Hitler's letter to the Turkish President, and all believe that the Turkish Ambassador to Berlin will soon deliver the Turkish government's reply to the German side. Currently, Berlin and Rome are jointly using sweet words with the aim of guaranteeing Turkey that it need not fear Germany's occupation of Bulgaria. A Turkish member of parliament published an article in a newspaper detailing the rapid entry of German troops into Bulgaria, saying that Germany has now become Turkey's neighbor, so Turkey must pay unprecedented attention, as Turkey has long been familiar with Nazi tactics. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - There is currently no reason to believe that Yugoslavia will sign a convention with the Axis powers in the near future. Germany has issued some unconfirmed rumors from the capital of Yugoslavia as part of a psychological war. One rumor claims that Britain has sent or intends to send an ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Regarding the recent diplomatic activities in Nanjing, although reports from British Minister to Yugoslavia, Sir Campbell, have not been obtained here, the claim of an ultimatum is definitely unreliable. According to a radio message from the capital of Yugoslavia, Deputy Cabinet Coordinator Dr. Martic told reporters from various newspapers that the government is constantly considering the country's highest interests and its independence. Regent Prince Paul met with Martic yesterday and had long talks with the Prime Minister and military leaders. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Belgrade - People here now believe that the Yugoslav government and newspapers' strong claims that German-Yugoslav relations are good are a reliable indication that the country is about to announce increased cooperation with Germany. Reliable Yugoslav sources said yesterday that the government may announce a policy of greater cooperation with Germany within 48 hours. Reliable Yugoslav sources said that Germany may not force Yugoslavia to accept the same policy as Bulgaria, but they may adopt a middle ground, similar to the current relationship between Sweden and Germany. Under these conditions, Yugoslavia would not only allow Germany to transport military supplies, but also allow German vehicles carrying wounded soldiers to pass through Yugoslav territory. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - It is rumored that Yugoslavia has been invited to mediate the Italo-Greek War. Officials here have solemnly denied this. It is also widely rumored that the Axis powers have demanded that if Yugoslavia does not want to formally join the Axis, it must at least issue a statement declaring its support for the Axis powers' policies and expressing its willingness to participate in the construction of a new European order. If this were to happen, the Axis powers would respect its territorial integrity, and Hungary and Bulgaria would also abandon their territorial demands on the country. This statement has neither been confirmed nor denied by officials. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Rumor: Soviet Union Makes Demands on Romania; Germany Says It Knows Nothing About It</p>
<p>Berlin - Well-informed German sources said yesterday that they had no knowledge of overseas reports that the Soviet Union had demanded that Romania cede Constanta, Galati, and the naval base of Tulcea. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>New York - Yesterday, newspapers published a touching report stating that the Soviet Union had issued an ultimatum to Romania, demanding a naval base in the Black Sea. However, the capitals of the countries involved in Europe, Romania, England, and Germany, all denied this yesterday. Therefore, this matter has likely been misreported. In the current situation, it is not expected that the Soviet Union will take a tough stance on the Balkans. Whether Germany's further intrusion into the Soviet Union's "sphere of influence" will cause Stalin to fight remains a mystery. (International Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Greece is United Nationally, Vows to Fight to the End: Soldiers on the Front Lines Advance Without Retreat, Always Maintaining an Active Position</h3>
<p>Athens - Officials have recently declared that Greece will not sign any peace treaty or accept any armistice agreement until the enemy has been completely defeated and begs for peace. Rumors that the Greek cabinet and King George II have different opinions, with George II advocating fighting to the end, even if it means retreating to Crete to continue fighting, while Prime Minister Koryzis advocates making peace with Italy, are completely untrue. The Greek government and people are united on the policy of resistance. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens - A Greek Information Department bulletin broadcast last night stated that the morale of the Greek soldiers is high and they remain in an active position. The Greek soldiers are determined to deal with all unforeseen events and will not flinch. The bulletin also stated that the Greek army continued to make progress on the Albanian front yesterday. Greek army patrols were successful, and artillery fire on Italian army positions was quite effective. A local encounter occurred in the central sector, resulting in the Greek army capturing some strong Italian army positions. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>General Weygand Returns to France to Report</h3>
<p>Vichy - General Weygand recently arrived here by plane from Algiers and met with Marshal Pétain. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Darlan returned from Paris approximately last night and will also meet with Weygand. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>The United States Demands Italy Close Two Consulates: Italy Had Taken Similar Action; The United States Retaliates</h3>
<p>Washington - Dispatches received here indicate that the German occupation of Italy is even more complete than the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is reported that all Italian seaports are now under German control, and the Italian secret police are now commanded by senior German police officers. Therefore, Italy can be regarded as a province of Germany. After German troops occupied most of Italy, such as Sicily, the Italian government asked the United States to close the two US consulates in Naples and Palermo. Therefore, the US State Department yesterday notified the Italian Embassy in the United States to close the two Italian consulates in Detroit and Newark and transfer the personnel of the two consulates to other locations. Another important point in this note is that apart from the diplomatic personnel of the Italian Embassy in Washington, the movements of Italian consulate personnel must be limited to their office area. In addition, if the military attachés of the Italian Embassy in Washington act outside of Washington, they must notify the US State Department at any time. Secretary of State Hull did not explain the reasons for this extraordinary move in this note, but the tone expressed dissatisfaction with the closure of the two US consulates in Naples and Palermo. There are many Italian immigrants in Detroit and Newark, and the Fascist Party is also very active. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Government Reports to the Senate: Pacific Defense Spending, Most Used for Hawaii</h3>
<p>Washington - When the Army and Navy budget bill was reported to the Senate yesterday, Hawaii ranked first among the Army and Navy bases in the Pacific islands that the US government designated to strengthen its defenses. The funds allocated to Hawaii in the bill exceeded US$130 million. Other funds were allocated to Samoa for US$8.1 million, to Wake Island for US$2,954,500, to Guam for US$4.7 million, to a submarine base for US$6.115 million, and to a naval airfield on Midway Island for US$5,592,000. Within the Hawaiian expenditure, US$68,270,000 was allocated to construct housing, storage rooms, and bomb shelters for the Pearl Harbor Navy, US$125,000 was allocated to construct a submarine base in Pearl Harbor, US$1,014,500 was allocated to construct the Kaneohe Bay Naval Air Station, US$26,000,000 was allocated to construct a naval hospital in Pearl Harbor, and US$23,000,000 was allocated to construct bomb shelters in the 14th Naval District. In addition, US$35,000,000 was allocated to construct four marine barracks, one of which will be in Pearl Harbor. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>The United States Allocates Huge Funds to Build New Ships</h3>
<p>New York - The New Republic magazine stated that the US Congress has allocated $6.5 billion to expand naval construction. As of September 9, 1940, the US government had already ordered 200 warships, totaling $4 billion. At the same time, in order to increase shipyard capacity, the Navy Department has loaned $76 million to private shipbuilding companies. Currently, the US Navy's shipbuilding plan includes seven battleships, 115 destroyers, 43 submarines, eight aircraft carriers, and 27 cruisers. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<h3>Dr. Currie Arrives in Honolulu, Believes Japan's Blockade of China Cannot Succeed</h3>
<p>Honolulu - Dr. Currie, President Roosevelt's special envoy to Chongqing, arrived here last night by clipper from Manila and will return to Washington to make a confidential report to President Roosevelt. Dr. Currie declined to comment on Japan's recent movements, but he said that China has many supply routes, which are extremely difficult to completely block. Currie meant that Japan's blockade of China, so far, has only been partially effective. Dr. Desbury, a government economic expert who accompanied Currie to Chongqing, was also traveling with him.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: The Price of Japonica Rice Rises Daily; Imported Rice Premiums Increase Subtly and Steadily</h3>
<p>The rice market, which once shifted from a tight to a slack situation in the previous days, saw the opposite happen yesterday. For both thick and thin japonica and domestic rice, the market opened with buyers generally taking a cautious view due to the previous day's pullback, fearing a sudden drop from the high plateau. They were hesitant to move forward, but sellers, with limited supplies, remained firm on prices. However, with trading activity muted, a standoff ensued. Unexpectedly, the off-market trading of imported rice suddenly tightened again, prompting renewed confidence among buyers who rushed to secure supplies. Seizing the opportunity, sellers raised prices, increasing gradually. Although the frenzy was not as intense as in the previous two days, it was nonetheless significant. As a result, Kunshan rice was priced at $120 per dan (unit of dry measure) for white japonica, $118 for the next grade, $123 for regular japonica, and Qingjiao rice was at $118 per dan for thin rice, $117.50 for the next grade, and $122 for original packages, an increase of more than two dollars from the previous day. Much of this rice was mixed with imported rice. Supply and demand for glutinous rice remained similar, lacking any changes. Hong Kong special grade was priced at $97-98, and the next grade at $95-96.</p>
<p>The off-market trading of imported rice, although initially softened by the arrival of large quantities of spot goods the day before, saw renewed tightening yesterday due to rumors of hoarding for both speculative and actual sales. Manipulators were demanding high prices, and the black market thrived. The premium for 100 bags of Xiaojiao rice reached $1,800, while Saigon Siam No. 1 was at $1,700-1,800, the next grade at $1,300, and broken rice at $1,000, an increase of $1-2. Amidst this chaotic and unpredictable market, one thing brought relief: Qinren Trading Co. offered 500 bags of Siam No. 1 rice at $85 per bag, with a limit of 20 bags per buyer. Although the quantity was limited, if everyone were as mindful as Qinren Trading Co., the public's food supply would not be as dire as it is now.</p>
<h3>Clock Tower Brand Flour: Over 30,000 More Bags Arrive</h3>
<p>Flour: The imported flour market remained stable yesterday. In terms of supply, in addition to the recent arrival of over 200,000 bags of Kemp flour, shipments from Hong Kong continued to arrive. Yesterday, over 30,000 bags of Clock Tower brand flour arrived via the Qingyuan ship from Hong Kong and have already been stored in warehouses. Other settled orders are also expected to arrive soon. As a result, public sentiment is not as excited as it was in the previous two days. However, with the temporary suspension of cheap flour sales by Chinese factories, actual sales in the market remain active. Holders are attempting to maintain prices. Unified market prices for Australia's Open Flower Bird brand flour were $29.05, and China's Golden Dragon brand Kemp flour was $28.05, a difference of one dollar. The market is in a state of build up, with total transactions of over 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market situation remained stagnant yesterday. Stocks of domestic wheat have been depleted for a long time. While there have been some shipments of imported wheat, they are all pre-ordered by factories. The amount circulating in the market is practically nonexistent. There are only asking prices, but no actual transactions.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The foreign exchange market was quiet yesterday. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currency offered nothing remarkable. Throughout the day, the market saw alternating periods of tightness and looseness, but nothing that attracted much attention. Speculators engaged in minor transactions, both buying and selling. The market saw a brief period of tightness in the morning when the Japanese bank came in to buy, but it eased again as the American bank supplied ample funds. The transaction price for American currency for this month was mostly at $5.50. Although there were some later transactions, the price remained the same. The closing spot price for American currency was still $5.50, and for British currency, it was 3/59375 shillings, a decrease of 0.015625 from the previous day. American currency saw no significant gains or losses, with a slight divergence between futures and spot prices.</p>
<p>The Japanese Bank Made Purchases</p>
<p>In the early morning, both near and far term London exchange rates were level, the New York silver price remained level, and the London gold price remained fixed. Exchange rates against American and Shanghai currencies were unchanged. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate shrunk by 25, but remained unchanged against the Shanghai currency. There was no market for the French exchange rate. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank opened the morning with a spot selling price of 3/59375 shillings for British gold and $5.46875 for American currency, which was 0.015625 tighter and 0.03125 weaker respectively than the previous day's closing price. However, the market hardened after opening because speculators were looking to sell, but foreign banks were not interested in buying. As a result, the Chinese banks in Shanghai absorbed the speculators' American currency for April at $5.50. At 9:30 AM, HSBC announced that their listed rates would remain unchanged. Later, when the Japanese bank came in to make purchases again, the market suddenly tightened. Foreign banks sold American currency for this month at $5.46875. Soon after, an American bank agreed to supply, and the Japanese and Chinese banks bought spot American currency from them at a stable price of $5.50. Speculators also had needs and re-entered Chase Bank, still buying American currency for this month at $5.50. There were few changes at noon. The spot price for American currency was reported at $5.50, and the price for British currency was 3/59375 shillings.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Stabilized in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market was quiet in the afternoon, with little trading and stable supply and demand. It was reported that Dutch merchants from Anta sold American currency for this month at $5.50 to brokers, who then resold it to small money shops for the same month at the same price. There was little fluctuation until the close of trading. As a result, the spot and this month's price for British currency was 3/59375 shillings, and the price for next month was 3/34375 shillings. The spot price for American currency was $5.50, the price for this month was $5.46875, and the price for next month was $5.4375. Compared to the previous day's price, British currency was 0.015625 tighter for both spot and this month's delivery, American currency was stable for spot delivery, and 0.03125 weaker for this month's delivery.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged</p>

<h3>Gold Market: Major Players Watch and Wait, Mostly Scalping Transactions</h3>
<p>The fluctuations in the black market spot price of gold yesterday appeared narrower compared to the previous few days, but the underlying trend remained firm. The price consistently hovered above $6,300. In the early morning, it briefly fell from a high of $6,360 to $6,310 due to selling by Hesheng and Dafeng, among others. The market recovered and stabilized by noon. There were no significant events later in the day, and trading volume decreased. This was largely due to the uncertain trend in foreign exchange, leading operators to mostly engage in scalping. Major players watched and waited. The closing price was $6,331, a decrease of one dollar from the previous day. Total transaction volume was approximately 15,000 taels. The spot price saw a gradual decline. Yongfeng Yu issued 20 taels of Joint Notes, at a premium of $470 over the forward price. Silver shops engaged in 20 tael transactions, at a premium of $460. In the afternoon, Chengji issued 50 taels, and Fengxiang and Heji issued 30 taels, which were bought by Shunyuan, at a premium of $440. Jewelry gold was down $10, to $690.</p>
<p>Fluctuations Without Major Ups and Downs</p>
<p>In the early morning, there was significant buying activity in the off-market after the previous day's closing, leading to firm prices. The market opened with a strong push, reaching $6,350, an increase of about $30. After opening, the price rose another $10 amid the enthusiasm, reaching $6,360. However, the upward momentum could not be sustained, and sellers poured in, including Hesheng, Dafeng, Xinfengyong, and Yida, flooding the market. The price gradually fell, but did not breach the $6,300 mark, stopping at $6,310. Subsequently, the market recovered slightly due to buying by Rencheng Yonggonghe, combined with the re-entry of Xinfengyong, hovering around $6,345. Although the exchange market did not undergo major changes, the underlying trend showed weakness, and market sentiment followed suit. By the noon close, Yida, Chengda, and Xinfengyong were inclined to sell, resulting in a price of $6,318. The market opened quietly in the afternoon, and the price remained unchanged at $6,318. After opening, the price rose due to exclusive buying by Chengji, but trading volume was low, reaching $6,333. Ultimately, Tongkangyong and Xinfengyong ran out of support, leading to a small decline to $6,315. Leading up to the close of trading, scattered retail buying pushed the price to $6,331, a decrease of one dollar from the previous day. Based on the settlement price of $5.6875 for March American currency, the price was $6,368, a reduction of $37. The total fluctuation for the day was only $50. After the close of trading, Tongkangyong re-entered the market, pushing the price to $6,335. The selling price of spot gold at cash shops was $460 higher than the spot price of gold futures and the purchase price was $80 lower. There were no transactions involving current and future margin calls.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Down Ten Dollars</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael in silver shops was reduced by ten dollars, with Da Tong Hang quoting $690. The prices at Xin Tong Hang were similar to previous prices, and the purchase price was reduced by forty dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Show a Depressed Trend</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's market conditions for public bonds were once again characterized by consolidation and weakness. The repeated consolidation of market prices resulted in a lack of trading activity, and market sentiment remained extremely sluggish, leading to a rather depressed trend. It is difficult to break through this stalemate in the short term. Yesterday's market prices saw slight weakness in the morning. Tongkang provided some support, while Renchang and Renfeng continued to buy, and Lianyi also had some needs. Hongda and Lianhe sold relatively more of Category B bonds. Xie Kang and Jiufeng sold 350,000 of Category C bonds and also sold Category D bonds, which caused a slight weakness in market prices. Trading volume was already sparse in the afternoon. Renchang and Renfeng continued to absorb bonds, and Lianhe made up for previous sales. Sanka was slightly receptive. Changtai, Xieda, Lianyi, and Xinchang sold bonds, resulting in a uniform decline of one to two and a half jiao (1/10 of a dollar). Total trading volume was estimated to be a little over one million dollars. A concise summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Family Industrial Cooperative were traded at a price of $90 each.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Thursday) dispatch: The listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat and sluggish today. Only the price of Mercantile Bank shares continued to rise by seven shillings and sixpence, to a price of eight and a half pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Lever Brothers to Distribute Dividends</h3>
<p>Lever Brothers (China) Limited plans to distribute a final dividend of $2 per share for 1940. The annual general meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held on March 19.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Thread: Mixed Yarn Sales Stagnate; Double Horse Brand's Position Weakens Daily</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken, and its position was quite precarious. This was due to the narrow sales channels and the significant disruptions to transportation, which dampened market sentiment. Despite various efforts to rally, short selling remained active, keeping the yarn market in a slump. The current market situation is characterized by considerable strength on both the long and short sides. The high price for Double Horse brand 20-count yarn was $1,375, and the low price was $1,337. The initial price in the afternoon was $1,363, which then fell to $1,346. The final price was $1,351. Today's exports included 1,260 bales of cotton yarn to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse brand opened with a high price because the off-market trading had rebounded on the previous day, which helped to support market sentiment. The initial price was $1,375, but it gradually declined as buyers were not enthusiastic. At the same time, sales to customers were as stagnant as ever, causing the price to fall to $1,360. However, the slightly weaker exchange rate and the stable margin deposit temporarily improved market sentiment. Unexpectedly, the mixed yarn market stalled, causing a significant weakening, which prompted some to liquidate their Double Horse brand holdings. The market price gradually declined to $1,337. Afterwards, profit-takers covered their short positions, causing the price to recover to $1,358 at the close of trading. The total trading volume for half a day was 10,065 bales. The amount traded by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Ningbo 10 bales</p>
<p>Same Trade 10 bales</p>
<p>Inland 10 bales</p>
<p>Statistics 10,065</p>
<p>Hong Kong 45</p>
<h3>Cotton Market is Stagnant and Difficult</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is increasingly unfavorable. This is due to the prevailing view that yarn sales are weak and that factory demand is stagnant, which makes the market extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet but firm due to buying by fellow traders and good cotton fabric trading conditions. As a result, the closing price was approximately one or two points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton was flat and weak. It initially rose due to speculative buying and then fell back due to long profit-taking. Yesterday, projections were about one rupee lower.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading remains in a hesitant and stagnant state. There are only occasional sporadic transactions, providing little activity.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fine Cloth is Searched for Cash and Arbitraged</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market trend was stable yesterday, and market prices fluctuated. This was because the Guangdong merchants were less enthusiastic and resold some of their purchased goods. However, fellow traders and hoarders mostly maintained their positions, so the decline has slowed. The market even showed a slight rebound later. Fugui fine cloth opened with a decline of 2.5 jiao (25 cents), selling at $42. It continued to fall another 2.5 jiao at noon, but then rebounded 2.5 cents later. The price of coarse cloth and twill also softened slightly. The price of bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged. Approximately 200 pieces of various cloths were traded in the market. The Zhejiang and Wen-Yong merchants handled 70-80 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. The Fujian merchants handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Northern merchants (from Yantai and Tianjin) handled 50-60 pieces of poplin, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Today, 320 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market initially declined and then rebounded. As a result, the spot price of fine cloth continued to fall by 5 to 7.5 jiao per piece, while the closing price for this month's Lung Tou (龙 头) futures on the exchange remained at $46 jiao (角), the same as the previous day. The minimum price for Lung Tou warehouse receipts in the market fell to $44.3 jiao. In the afternoon, market sentiment improved, and speculators searched for spot goods for arbitrage, gradually raising the price to $45.65 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge remained relatively firm, falling to a small amount of $1.275, with more buying than selling. It rebounded to close at $1.295.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Oil Rises Another Three Dollars; All Miscellaneous Grains Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains, oil, and soybean cake, except for soybean cake, which saw a solitary decline of two to three jiao, continued to see rampant price increases due to hoarding and buying by hoarders. The market was like a bouncing ball, with fierce competition between buyers and sellers. As a result, corn became more active, red sorghum rose by three jiao, soybeans frequently rose by half a dollar, raw oil rose another three dollars, and soybean oil rose by about one dollar. The futures market initially remained level, then declined, and then rose again. The closing price was half a dollar higher than the previous day's market price. Today, 9,620 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Crude White Opens at 800 Tons</h3>
<p>The sugar market trended slightly calmer yesterday. Both crude white, Dutch Red, and others rebounded slightly. The guild's price was $81 for 24 crude white, half a dollar cheaper, for those stored at the local warehouse, and $80.8 to $80.6 jiao (角), a small three jiao cheaper for those stored elsewhere. The contract for March 20 was trading at $81.3 to $81.8 jiao (角), a small eight jiao cheaper. The Dutch Red initially rose and then loosened to $64.9 to $64.5 jiao (角), a small three jiao cheaper.

East Warehouse vehicles were at $82 while DY-Mark was at $79.5 jiao (角) small five jiao and HX-Mark was at $79.2 jiao (角) small two jiao. Crystal white ice was set at $104.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Fu Hong Dates Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Fu Hong Dates from Zouxian, the market price tightened once again yesterday and held at $45 before there was any willingness to sell. Perhaps today will see a transaction, which would indicate a further increase of three dollars. This shows that a gradual increase is underway with no prospect of loosening.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sago Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Prices for raw starch have recently become more stable. Yesterday, Flying Unicorn brand was at $120, while One-Mark was at $112, Old Unicorn brand was at $98, Anchor brand was at $88, Double TA mark was at $86, and Double T mark was at $82. However, the increase in sago prices was very sharp. Large grain sago was at $110 and small grain sago was at $105, an increase of $15 to $12.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailuan Bituminous Coal is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Kailuan Bituminous Coal has seen its source be limited, leading to daily shortages. Demand exceeds supply. The electric companies recently sought out bituminous coal, causing these prices to increase. The management company has ceased making contracts, leading to a more vigorous black market. Transactions amongst fellow firms sees Kailuan lump coal going for 255 per ton and second grade small coal at $180 with additional warehousing fees and outside firm fees.</p>
<h3>Metals: Green Lead Iron Transactions Flow Smoothly</h3>
<p>Green Lead Iron comes in the forms of Company cargo and Double Plate. Its use is commonly for manufacturing such as for thermos and canned goods. With the current oversea supply completely severed and inventories limited the trades have seen an increase in price. Currently Company cargo is at $200 and Double Plate $220.</p>
<h3>Potatoes</h3>
<p>— Gao Chuang Nong</p>
<p>Among the several plants that spread from the New World to the whole world - we have already discussed tobacco and cinchona - the potato is the most beneficial to humans. Its native land is Chile and Peru in South America, and it originally included more than forty species. Today, people can still encounter its wild companions in its homeland. When Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish explorer, led a group of crude and ignorant soldiers and merchants to land in the ancient Inca Empire - now Peru - in 1531 AD, they encountered this sweet-tasting tuberous plant everywhere, which is the potato, and also the sweet potato. However, sweet potatoes grew everywhere in the hot plains and fertile fields, while potatoes only thrived in the cold-temperate mountainous areas. Those uneducated Spaniards wantonly ravaged and destroyed the civilization of the ancient Inca Empire, but when they saw the nutrient-rich tuberous plants, they couldn't help but soften their hearts and "spare them". A man named POiega de Leon, who served under Pizarro, lived in Peru for seventeen years, and also wrote the chronicle of Peru, first recorded the traces of potatoes in 1550, calling its name Papas, and many people later used this name. As for its Latin scientific name, Solanum tuberosum, and its French name "Pomme de terre" (earth apple), it was only in 1716 that an ordinary engineer named Prezier traveled to South America and wrote a travelogue of Chile and Peru that he first used to call it by these names. Unexpectedly, it has become widely used in France. Our country calls it potato, of course because its shape resembles a horse bell, and there are also names such as foreign yam and yam, which are local dialects. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Today is International Women's Day: Women's Day Encourages Loyalty; Declaration Issued Clarifying Great Significance; Continue Promoting Savings Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>Today is "March 8" International Women's Day. The women of Shanghai, recognizing the great responsibilities of women in the era of resistance and nation-building, are unanimously focusing on military spirit and encouraging diligent work in their respective positions. Ideologically, they are adhering to the spirit of the New Life Movement's principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. In action, they are fulfilling the national oath stipulated in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, working hard, and persevering to strive for the freedom and equality of the entire nation and to achieve the goal of women's liberation. They will continue to promote savings donations, which will be submitted to the authorities for distribution to various comfort stations. Today, in addition to holding simple gatherings to celebrate, women's groups have decided to jointly send a telegram to the highest leader and the front lines, representing two million women in the city, to express their sincere respect. It is also heard that a certain women's group here is launching preparations for a women's library today to commemorate this year's victorious "March 8" Women's Day, which is of great significance. The declaration issued by the women of this city is recorded below, with particular attention to its essential points.</p>
<p>Spiritual Commemoration: Great Festival</p>
<p>Dear sisters, the glorious "March 8" anniversary of the world has arrived again today. We are on an isolated island shrouded in the forces of darkness. For this personal and great anniversary, we cannot shout a slogan, post a banner, hold a parade, or hold a grand meeting. This is not because we have forgotten this anniversary with great practical significance, but because we are being suppressed and are temporarily suspending it in form. However, our spirit is always connected and commemorated with the national policy of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Women's Movement Work: Heavy Responsibilities</p>
<p>In the prelude to "March 8," the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang instructed in a broadcast address that "promoting the women's movement" is one of the main tasks of this year. Due to the emphasis on women's work by wise leaders, we feel the weight of our responsibilities even more. Because of the harshness of the environment, we cannot take action today, but we should be more vigilant in spirit.</p>
<p>Maintain Purity: Eliminate Extravagance</p>
<p>This year is the year of victory. We see that the great cause of resistance and nation-building is about to be completed. However, in the dark period before dawn, we must vigorously implement the following five principles: (1) Develop a pure character. No matter how harsh the environment, we must always adhere to the ambition of "not being corrupted by wealth and honor, not being moved by poverty and meanness, and not being subdued by force," and maintain our pure character of "emerging from the mud without being stained." (2) Eliminate extravagant customs. We should cancel unnecessary gifts, unnecessary banquets, and all expenses exceeding the necessities of life, and use them for various donations and to help refugees.</p>
<p>Improve Knowledge: Strive for Production</p>
<p>(3) Improve the level of knowledge. Students should certainly do this, but housewives and working women should also collect spiritual food in various ways in addition to housework and business to improve their level of knowledge. (4) Cultivate self-reliant habits. We should not be greedy for comfort and avoid work or give up work. We must become a working woman in society and a responsible member of the family.</p>
<p>Strive for the Future: Glorious Position</p>
<p>(5) Strive for a glorious position. Since the beginning of the war, women across the country have directly and indirectly endured many sacrifices and participated in many jobs in the front and rear. On this "March 8" festival, which welcomes victory, we must work harder and strive for a permanent and glorious position in the future with our achievements.</p>
<p>The Nation First, the People First</p>
<p>In short, we feel that this year's "March 8" festival has a particularly great significance, because we already see the dawn of hope shining before our eyes. However, we must recognize that the "March 8" International Women's Day is a festival to strive for women's liberation. To strive for women's liberation, we must first strive for the liberation of the nation and the country. Therefore, we should unite under the goal of putting the nation and the country first, and work hard to strive for victory in the war of resistance and national liberation.</p>
<p>Destroying Unity: Strike Hard</p>
<p>Moreover, we must also recognize that today, when the final victory is about to come, there are still some degenerates who are willing to destroy unity at all costs. Relying on international background, they directly and indirectly aid evildoers, or betray the resistance in the middle. We women should give these national sinners the most powerful blows, uphold the government's wise policy on rectifying military discipline, and eliminate the international supreme doctrine and peaceful fallacies of riding-the-fence nationals. In this way, we can achieve the great cause of resistance and gain women's liberation.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Donations to Reach 200,000</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army’s commander, Mr. Ma Lishi (马立师), stated that up until yesterday donations had reached around 182,000 National Currency (国币). It is estimated to reach 200,000 soon. It has been reported that an enthusiastic Chinese Merchant donated 10,000 alone. Those who wish to donate may send their donation of any amount to The Salvation Army Headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House (沙逊大楼). All donations of any amount are welcome.</p>
<h3>Replacement of Second High Court President After Kidnapping, Guo Yun-guan Temporarily Assumes Position.</h3>
<p>Xu Weizhen (徐维震), President of the Second Jiangsu High Court, was kidnapped on the afternoon of the fourth of this month after finishing court business. He and his wife were riding in the same car to return to their residence in the Yang family’s public housing on Hualong Road (华龙路), when they were ambushed by thugs hiding in front of their residence. There has been no news since. After this incident, the court has continued to operate normally and has requested instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration (司法行政部). The Court has now received a ministry order to temporarily appoint Guo Yun-guan (郭云观), President of the First Special District (第一特区) District Court, as the acting Court President. Security around the court has been tightened. Security around the First Special District (第一特区) Court has also not been loosened.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Australian-Dutch Concentration of Forces to Defend the Entire South Seas: Breaking Political Barriers to Unite Naval and Air Power; Joint Defense by the Four Countries Sufficient to Resist Any Aggression</h3>
<p>Tension is mounting in the Pacific, and the evolution of the situation is noteworthy. However, those who play with fire will eventually burn themselves. As aggressors desperately attempt to advance southward, a new group of nations comprising the United States, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands has formed. If Japan attempts to advance southward, it will not encounter the Dutch East Indies, Australia, or the United States individually, but rather a strong, integrated group of these four countries. Foreign observers here have conducted thorough research on the Pacific situation.</p>
<p>America Actually Occupies a Leading Position</p>
<p>It is generally said that after the capitulation of France, the main Pacific powers are only Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands. Britain, due to its involvement in the European war, is unable to dedicate its main forces to the Far East. However, Australia and Britain are essentially one entity, and Australia, in terms of both economy and military, remains an important factor in the current Pacific situation. The Netherlands is willing to fully cooperate with Britain. However, the United States takes the lead, for both spiritual and material reasons, the fate of the United States is inextricably linked to the Pacific.</p>
<p>Moral Rights and Interests Must Be Safeguarded</p>
<p>In short, the United States, in material terms, needs tin, rubber, and other minerals produced in Asia. In commercial terms, the United States has over $500 million in annual trade and tens of millions of dollars in investments in South Asia. Politically, the United States still bears the obligation to protect the interests of its Far Eastern nationals and the 16 million people of the Philippines. Spiritually, it cannot abandon its moral responsibilities under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. At present, America's first line of defense is the British Navy in Europe, and in the Far East, it is China's war effort. Therefore, assistance to Britain and China will be provided with full force. Once the Lend-Lease Act is passed, America's assistance to China and Britain will become even more earnest. The notion that the United States will retreat if something happens in the Pacific is impossible.</p>
<p>Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands: One Group</p>
<p>Now, the pressure from aggressive forces in the Pacific is intensifying, and the situation is becoming more critical, leading Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands to converge into a group, forming an unbreakable fortress. This eliminates the entire political region of the South Seas. Strategically, the South Seas stretch from Hong Kong in the north to Australia and New Zealand in the south, from Cavite in Manila in the east to Singapore in the west, including Surabaya in Java, Tanjung Priok in Batavia, and other ports. This vast area will support each other and form a mutually reinforcing defense.</p>
<p>Naval Strength Is Exceptionally Strong</p>
<p>The United States is now consulting on the use of naval bases in the Americas and New Zealand, and it is possible that Singapore will be further utilized in the future. The United States recently reorganized its navy, and the Far East Fleet stands alone, with the potential for expansion. The dispatch of ships from Hawaii to the Philippines by the United States is also a precautionary measure. The Dutch East Indies currently has three cruisers, eight destroyers, a squadron of submarines, and eight mine-laying and mine-sweeping vessels each, as well as 1,000 aircraft. If the situation in the Mediterranean improves, Britain may well transfer part of its fleet to the east.</p>
<p>Air Power Is Not to Be Ignored</p>
<p>As for the importance of air power, the Philippines alone has over a hundred airfields, and the Dutch East Indies has at least ten or twenty, similar to Malaya. The Philippines also has well-equipped military airfields. The United States Air Force in the Philippines is growing rapidly. Australian air forces have successively flown to Singapore, making Singapore an important air fortress. It is noteworthy that the British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, is himself an air force marshal. The combined air power of Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands is, in terms of quality and quantity, no less than that of Japan. Even the air power of the Dutch East Indies alone, currently concentrated in Surabaya, purchased 300 aircraft from the United States from 1933 to 1936, imported 318 in 1938, and has nearly 1,200 new aircraft. The Dutch East Indies is only a four-hour sea journey from Singapore, and aircraft can reach it in forty minutes.</p>
<p>If Japan Advances Southward, the Future Is Foreseeable</p>
<p>From this, we can see that joint defense by Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands is highly likely. Looking at the overall situation, it can be determined that if the southward advance does not involve armed conflict, that is one thing. But if it rashly resorts to force, it will encounter a new group of countries integrated as one entity: Britain, America, Australia, and the Netherlands. Its clay feet will not withstand a second stumble. Therefore, the so-called southward advance is a matter of committing ritual suicide.</p>
<h3>Czech Expatriates Celebrate the Birthday of the Late Czech President</h3>
<p>Three hundred and fifty Czech expatriates in Shanghai held an informal gathering at the YMCA at 214 Avenue Albert last night (the 7th) to commemorate the late President Masaryk of the Czechoslovak Republic. Major Stephen, honorary secretary of the Czech Association, will deliver a speech.</p>
<p>Doctors Strive to Benefit the Country</p>
<p>President Masaryk was born in 1850. Born of humble origins, he embraced a spirit of relentless struggle and eventually became the most beloved figure in the Czech Republic. He served as president from 1918 to 1935 and passed away on September 14, 1937, one year before Germany began its invasion of Czechoslovakia. During the World War, Masaryk traveled extensively to the Allied countries. In the spring of 1918, he also visited China and Japan, staying for several weeks.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Receive Donations</h3>
<p>Since the New Pu Yu Tang appealed for relief, people from all walks of life have shown great sympathy and generously donated. Some have made long-term monthly donations and others have helped solicit large donations. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are truly admirable. However, the goal is still far from being reached, and we hope for continued assistance. The donations received yesterday are listed below: Chen Jichen, 300 yuan; Tang Shiyi Pharmacy, Lu Shigeng, 200 yuan each; Xingliu Dinner Party, Cungutang Cao, 100 yuan each; Zhou Shuyi, Hua Yi, Wei Yi, jointly 100 yuan; Lu Renjian, 50 yuan; anonymous, 20 yuan; anonymous, 10 yuan; Gong Shaoping, 6 yuan; Zhang Junhe, San Sheng Tang, 5 yuan each; Fan Qinliang, Fan Qinbin, Fan Qinming, Lu Fanping, Chen Shanxing, Tao Miaofa, 1 yuan each; Zhang Songmin, a set of old cotton-padded clothes.

<h3>Rice Snatching in the Downtown Area Yesterday Morning: A Large Group of Poor People Snatched Four Bags on Route Doumer</h3>
<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, a certain meter vehicle was transporting eight bags of white rice to a certain location. When the vehicle passed the intersection of Route de Sikawei and Route Doumer, a large group of poor people suddenly blocked the way, cut open the rice bags with small knives, and seized the white rice. The order in the middle of the road was chaotic for a time. The driver was helpless and called for the police. By the time the nearby patrol officers arrived, four bags of white rice had been snatched, and the poor people had scattered. Afterwards, the driver of the vehicle reported the incident to a certain rice shop, which in turn reported it to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Improvement of the Rice Market: Bill Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to discuss the stabilization of food for the people, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Committee held a full committee meeting at 2:30 yesterday afternoon in the conference room on the first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. All members of the committee were present, chaired by Mr. Marshall, and adjourned at 4:00. After the meeting, the reporter from Dazhong News Agency inquired about the details from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office. Because the bill was still being processed, it could not be released. However, according to general speculation, the committee has made a resolution on various measures to improve the rice market.</p>
<p>Flour Sold at Reduced Prices: To Be Continued Next Week</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of flour at reduced prices, the supply had been suspended since February 18 due to the suspension of work at the Fuxin Factory, resulting in the temporary suspension of the sale of flour at reduced prices. It is now known that after repeated negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Fuxin Factory, the factory has agreed to continue to supply 5.873 bags daily from today (the 8th), with each bag sold at 25 yuan, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for the flour shop, until 250,000 bags are sold. Although the above-mentioned selling price is slightly higher than before, it is several yuan lower per bag than the current market price. The factory is commended for its enthusiasm for public welfare in order to regulate the flour market by generously agreeing to continue to supply. It is also known that the Fufeng Factory is unable to produce flour due to a shortage of raw materials, so the supply of flour at reduced prices has been temporarily suspended. As for the sale of flour at reduced prices, it can still be resumed starting next week. That is, users can collect flour from their original flour shops on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday each week, according to the amount they should receive (a total of 8.318 bags per day) (no flour will be issued on Wednesday and Sunday). If there is a shortage in the future, it will be supplemented with the amount obtained from the levy on foreign flour. According to the new factory price of 25 yuan per bag for the sale of foreign flour at reduced prices, the price has also been changed to 25 yuan per bag.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board Approves the Economic Committee Report; Whether or Not to Keep the Orchestra to Be Decided by Taxpayers; Agents in London and New York Temporarily Retained; Expanding Tax Revenue Should Prevent License Holders from Evading Taxes</h3>
<p>The final report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board at its meeting on March 5. This report includes an investigation into the expenditures of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra and the expenditures of agents in London and New York, as well as the activities of the Tax Revenue Subcommittee. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>Whether to Retain the Orchestra</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra is one of the cultural undertakings supported by a small amount of municipal funds. After considering the accounts of the orchestra and its budget of 378,540 yuan for the year 1941, we believe that the organization of the orchestra is very economical. If this entertainment is to be continued, this budget cannot be reduced. However, the question of whether this organization is needed is in the hands of the taxpayers. Therefore, we believe that the policy that the Shanghai Municipal Council should adopt is to seek the consent of the taxpayers as to whether the orchestra should be maintained.</p>
<p>Agents' Remuneration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently paid close attention to the expenditure of the London agent. Since January 1, 1940, the expenditure of the London agent has been greatly reduced. As things stand, if these agents are not summarily dismissed, their remuneration cannot be further reduced. Because the Shanghai Municipal Council currently has a number of British nationals receiving pensions and a number of British staff, these agents are essential. If the situation changes in the future, the Shanghai Municipal Council may terminate the positions of these London and New York agents.</p>
<p>Expanding Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The activities of the Tax Revenue Subcommittee have been fully outlined in the second short report. This report focuses on the issue of increasing the Shanghai Municipal Council's license fees. We believe that from the fiscal year of 1941, the Shanghai Municipal Council must obtain additional funds. At present, the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue consists of land tax, property tax, advertising tax, license fees, and wharf dues. According to the Subcommittee's investigation, the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue under the Land Regulations is very limited, only the above-mentioned taxes. The Subcommittee will fully review the Shanghai Municipal Council's license fee revenue to ensure that places subject to license fees cannot evade taxes. The cost of the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax collection has been reduced from 3.26% in 1931 to 2.55% in 1940. The Subcommittee has examined the situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau and is satisfied with its effective and economical work.</p>
<h3>Reducing Electricity Supply: Users Should Cooperate; Large Users Should Not Use It as an Excuse to Raise Prices; The Reduction in Electricity Consumption Is Aimed at Preventing Common Losses</h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary electricity reduction measures approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, all parties have praised them. However, the concern is that major factories will use the increase in electricity costs as an excuse to raise prices. Yesterday, the English-language 大美晚报 commented on this matter, issuing a warning to large electricity users. The original text reads:</p>
<p>Small Users: No Increase in Electricity Costs</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, users of the Shanghai Power Company who use more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month will be required to reduce their electricity consumption by 30% in the future. Any excess will be charged a fee equal to three times the normal rate. This measure is worthy of our approval because it is specifically targeted at large users who can afford the loss and does not intend to place any further burden on small users who are already heavily burdened. Although this measure will cause some inconvenience, if measures are not taken to correct it now, the losses suffered by large users will be greater than what they are currently suffering. However, if large users take advantage of this and shift the blame onto others, raising prices and causing losses to the final consumer, the purpose of the Shanghai Municipal Council's move will be defeated. For the above reasons, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council is confident that the residents of the International Settlement will be able to cooperate with it. At the same time, if anyone dares to disregard the overall welfare of the Settlement and refuses to cooperate with this initiative aimed at the welfare of all residents, we will all abandon them.</p>
<p>The Impact After the Electricity Reduction</p>
<p>According to industrial sources, after the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented the electricity reduction measures, most industries in the city, with the exception of a very few, were greatly affected. Among those most affected were the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. According to past surveys, Japanese factories consume approximately 250 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, accounting for about half of the total electricity supply of the Shanghai Power Company. Although the Japanese side has complained about the significant impact of this measure on Japanese industries, it is generally believed that the Japanese side will not make strong protests. Industrial sources in the city firmly believe that the implementation of this new measure will inevitably lead to some adjustments in the production procedures and labor relations of various factories.</p>
<h3>The 謀福 Steamer Was Detained</h3>
<p>The 謀福 steamer of the German firm 禮和洋行 had been suspended for a long time due to the interruption of the Shanghai-Zhejiang route. It recently departed from Shanghai on the 日 of this month and set sail for Fuqing. Unexpectedly, it was stopped by Japanese warships in the waters of the estuary, prohibiting entry. According to the shipping department of the 謀福 steamer, the ship was detained on the 5th of this month and has not been released for three days. It has now been reported to the German Consulate to make representations. It is also understood that the ship was carrying only cargo and no passengers.</p>
<h3>Wu Xiaoan Was Kidnapped in Front of the Eve Ball Room; Two Kidnappers Threatened with Handguns; The Police Are Investigating, but Have Not Yet Found Any Trace</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 4:00, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred in front of the Eve Ball Room on Route Ghisi, Shanghai. The kidnapped person was Wu Xiaoan. Two kidnappers forced Wu into a car and drove west.</p>
<p>The Kidnapping Circumstances</p>
<p>Wu Xiaoan lives in Room A-12, Washington Apartments, 233 Avenue Pétain, French Concession, with his wife and sister. He owns a private car with a French Concession license number of 11150. Recently, his original driver was ill and on leave, so Wu drove the car himself. The night before, it was his friend's birthday, so he and his sister and friends took his private car to the Eve Nightclub at 1238 Rue du Consulat to celebrate with a banquet and dance. At around 4:00 yesterday morning, they were returning after the festivities. Just as he opened the car door and stepped into the car, two kidnappers who had been lying in wait beside the car suddenly pulled out handguns and threatened Wu's friend and sister, ordering them to get out of the car. They forced Wu into the car and the kidnappers drove it west.</p>
<p>No Trace Yet</p>
<p>Afterwards, his sister and his friends witnessed the situation and were helpless. They went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the incident. The police immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in police cars to the scene to investigate and ordered street police to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. However, as of last night, Wu's residence had not received any news from Wu, and the car had not been found. The police are making every effort to investigate this kidnapping case.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle Speeding: Another Life Lost</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 yesterday afternoon, several Japanese military trucks were speeding back and forth along North Szechuen Road and the Suzhou Creek area, patrolling. At that time, a peddler selling oranges was carrying a load of fresh oranges on his shoulder, just coming south from North Szechuen Road. At that time, the trucks were driving at extremely high speed. The peddler, due to the heavy load, was unable to avoid them in time and was knocked down by the speeding Japanese military truck. His brains splattered on the spot. Before he could be sent to the hospital for treatment, he died. The vehicle that caused the accident drove away at full speed towards Hongkou.</p>
<h3>British Far East Information Officer Scott Arrives in Shanghai: British Embassy Hosts a Welcome Dinner</h3>
<p>Mr. Scott, the Far East Information Officer of the British Ministry of Information, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Singapore a few days ago. A reporter from 平明社 learned from the British Embassy office here yesterday that Alexander, the information officer at the British Embassy, hosted a welcome dinner for Mr. Scott at his residence on Haig Road the night before. It is understood that Mr. Scott came to Shanghai to inspect the British wartime information work in various parts of the Far East and to provide instructions on information matters in Shanghai. He will stay for a few days before leaving Shanghai for other places.</p>
<h3>Rong Wu Society to Lecture on Sutras Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society will hold a sutra lecture at the Pudong Daming on Route Edward VII at 4:00 tomorrow afternoon, the 9th of this month. Listeners are requested to arrive on time.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Industry Association Meeting: No Increase in Selling Prices</h3>
<p>According to sources, the rumour yesterday that the coal briquette industry had decided to increase selling prices is incorrect. The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association did not convene a meeting to increase coal briquette selling prices. This was a decision made privately by coal merchants who were blinded by greed, which is illegal.</p>
<h3>National Physician Chen Susheng to Lecture on Stroke Experience</h3>
<p>The 漢未 Public Announcement at 190 Beijing Road in this city has invited the famous Shanghai national physician Chen Susheng to lecture on stroke experience at the Xinsheng Radio Station on Nanjing Road at 7:20 this afternoon. Those suffering from high blood pressure who lack knowledge of health preservation can tune in at that time. Dr. Chen's knowledge and experience are extremely rich, and since the start of the lectures, the audience has been enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Flying Eagle Car Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Williams Flying Eagle car has a wheelbase of 104 inches and a body length of 181 inches. It is beautiful, comfortable, and drives and operates like a large car, but its operating costs are as economical as a small car. Since its launch, it has been recognized as the latest contribution of the American automobile industry in 1941. It has now been brought to Shanghai by the local distributor, Maddie Motors Company, and will be on display today at the company's showroom at 640 Avenue Foch, open to the public for viewing.</p>
<h3>Lost Child Picked Up</h3>
<p>A boy named Li Asan, six years old, from Ningbo, was playing on the street the other day and got lost. The patrol officer found that the child has large eyes and thick eyebrows and is wearing a red cloth jacket. He is now being held in the Children's Welfare Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Room 605, waiting to be claimed. Those who recognize him can go to contact them at 9:00 every morning.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 yesterday afternoon stated that Shandong is quite cold, with fog and north-west to northerly winds. This area and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island are cloudy, quite cold, with fog and north-west to north-east winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 yesterday afternoon, the temperature in this city was 59.4 degrees at its highest and 45.1 degrees at its lowest.

<h3>Another Chinese Constable's Gun Robbed: Will Be Severely Punished; Four Robbers Intercepted a Pedestrian and Robbed a Constable's Gun Yesterday Morning; The Constable Will Be Severely Reprimanded for Not Resisting the Robbers</h3>
<p>According to the English-language 大美晚报, at 9:00 this morning (the 7th), a pedestrian named 甲 was suddenly intercepted by four armed robbers at the intersection of Hankou Road and Hubei Road. Unable to resist, he was robbed of 866 yuan in cash. 甲 then reported the incident to a certain Chinese constable on duty nearby. Unexpectedly, the four robbers followed and, seeing 甲 talking to the Chinese constable, rushed forward and surrounded the Chinese constable, robbing him of his service handgun before fleeing. It is reported that, according to the order issued last year by the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, the Chinese constable will be suspended from duty and pay for not resisting the robbers and allowing his handgun to be robbed. According to the police chief's order, issued last year due to repeated incidents of Chinese constables in the Western District having their service handguns robbed, all Chinese constables who lose their guns will be suspended from duty until the handgun is recovered and must be interrogated, detailing the circumstances under which the handgun was robbed.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Pain on Society</h3>
<p>Pain sometimes gives us a lot of trouble. When we have a little pain, we may have to make difficult decisions, suffer serious losses in our business, and be unable to express our opinions at meetings. As for social circles, it is even more damaging. When making appointments, we have to cancel them at the last minute.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to stay at home in the end. If a patient suffers from menstrual pain, then family life is full of pain. The children are unruly, and when the husband comes home, he sees his wife lying in bed, showing annoyance on her face. Therefore, pain is enough to affect our physical health, and indirectly it also affects the safety of the entire society.</p>
<p>However, we do not have to endure pain, because as long as we take one or two 快剃痛 tablets, the pain will stop within ten minutes. It is safe, and no matter which individual has which pain, 快剃痛 powder is the best choice.</p>

<h3>The Deaf Father</h3>
<p>— Xie Yilong</p>
<p>To support a family of over ten people as someone who didn't graduate from middle school and became deaf early in life – that's my father.</p>
<p>We have eight siblings, eight hungry mouths, drinking my father's lifeblood every day. My father became deaf at the age of twenty, supposedly because he worked too hard. Indeed, at that time, he was an apprentice at a bank during the day and had to attend night school and write manuscripts in the evening, accumulating over time and exchanging his hearing for knowledge and livelihood. He heard my strong cries when I was born, but he couldn't hear my soft babbling as I learned to speak.</p>
<p>My father became deaf, but he never lost heart. He is an optimistic person with a strong will. Deafness further determined his future; he was able to focus on his career and pursuit of knowledge by cutting off external disturbances. With his usual character and reputation, he not only didn't lose his job because of his deafness, but also gained people's trust through caution and care.</p>
<p>He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, and he doesn't go to theaters or dance halls (deafness significantly affected his entertainment). On holidays, he likes to take Mom and us to restaurants for dim sum, and libraries and parks are his only recreational places.</p>
<p>For thirty years, from when I was the only child to becoming the eldest brother of eight siblings, I don't need to tell you about my father's hard work. When people praised us in front of my father, his smile warmed the hearts of us brothers. Five of us brothers are studying, and the youngest is still breastfeeding, all expenses borne by my father alone. But when he saw our report cards, he always forgot about the huge tuition fees he paid with joy.</p>
<p>My father always has bright expectations and happy ideals. He's only forty years old, although he looks a little older. But he is already the father of eight children who only know how to enjoy.</p>
<p>The wrinkles on my father's face are the marks of our siblings' lives. We grow every year, and my father's wrinkles increase every year. But he doesn't think of himself as old; his forward-looking and upward-striving heart is more eager than that of young people.</p>
<p>My father doesn't like to talk much, nor does he often scold us. But we don't have spoiled siblings. Each person is a role model for another, each person is another's sibling, so the atmosphere in the family is always so harmonious.</p>
<p>My father is very kind to others. All the neighbors praise him, and his colleagues are also happy to help him. He tells us, "Humility will never harm us."</p>
<p>My father often tells us that if he didn't have so many children, his wealth would be considerable. He could have cars and villas. This is his lament. He values us more than wealth. He often strokes the heads of the younger siblings and says, "Children, you are my only wealth, my only hope."</p>
<p>My father is very frugal with himself, but he rarely refuses our requests. He often says to Mom, "Don't constantly discourage the children's desires."</p>
<p>I am twenty years old, and when I think about how my father was already supporting Mom and me by his own efforts twenty years ago, I feel too ashamed. Besides the tears of self-blame, I silently wish my father good health here.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>In Defense of Education</h3>
<p>— San</p>
<p>The track and field teacher felt that "this so-called education should go to the grave to rest" because the students in his school didn't maintain order in the library. Many people who read this article are worried about education—especially the old men who can never see the truth. My uncle said to me like this: "Humph, this kind of education is really worthless!"</p>
<p>Actually, should education "go to the grave to rest"? I think this kind of lament is superfluous.</p>
<p>Yes, nine out of ten libraries in Shanghai universities are no less noisy than tea rooms. But this cannot be said to be the failure of education itself; this is the failure of educators! Look, isn't the hardworking spirit of students in Free China a good proof for us? Many newspapers and magazines publish articles about the living conditions of students in Free China, which clearly tell us that education has not failed, just like science itself is not guilty; the only thing that has failed is the educator.</p>
<p>The track and field teacher also gave a counter-example, saying, "Some public libraries—where the readers are mostly small clerks who haven't even entered middle school—are very quiet." This inevitably makes people feel that the track and field teacher's thinking is too simple. Can it be said that small clerks who haven't even entered middle school haven't received an education? Does "receiving education" necessarily have to be signaled by a bell, in a classroom, taught chapter by chapter by a professor? Isn't their quiet reading itself receiving education? Doesn't the track and field teacher know that society is also a university? It must be known that anything that only emphasizes form and not substance is most undesirable, especially education. It's no wonder that the track and field teacher laments "this so-called education" when he emphasizes form so much.</p>
<p>The value of education cannot be measured. Unfavorable phenomena produced under special circumstances cannot bury the entire education, just as we cannot conclude that humans are barbaric animals because of the killing and arson of invaders.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Life's Great Discount</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>I occasionally flipped through my old diary—this is a painful record, an account of life's payments—and saw the words written on the last page:</p>
<p>"Life is like a榨床 (oil press), and like a stone mill, pressing my life into渣滓 (dregs), grinding my health into 奮粉 (powder). The painful endurance has reached a saturation point! But how many times have I said the old tune that pain has reached its peak and can no longer be endured? However, the result is like a great discount in a store, saying that it will not be extended, but the result is still an extension. But store discounts are mostly false, while my life's discount is a real sacrifice of capital. Closing the store is only a matter of time! In the repeatedly extended great discount period before closing the store, flowing the remaining capital is really too miserable! I also know that it's not worth it to close the door only after the capital is exhausted. Since the door is going to close sooner or later, why not close the door of life as soon as possible? But my original desire to survive is struggling, it tremblingly shelters the broken and remnant life, refusing to submit. So I have to continue my life's great discount, letting it flow out the last drop of blood!"</p>
<p>Crimson blood seemed to be flowing before my eyes, and my numb heart suddenly felt a shock! This is the lament of my life! How cruel and ashamed I am! I can't protect my own life, and I still want to be my own executioner! Animals have an innate instinct for self-defense, and humans are even more intelligent animals: although you have lost your health, and therefore cannot take the more convenient path of self-defense, you can use your wisdom, exert your spiritual power, tortuously and arduously to achieve your purpose of self-defense. You have to fight, you can't let your blood continue to flow away, you should protect your own life, this is your great duty, and it is also for the sake of humanity!</p>

<h3>Chinese Flowering Crabapple</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) An Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>"Very well, would you please wait for me for four or five minutes, Madam?" Qiu Haitang immediately took an active pencil from the hem of his gray gown, tore off two pages of white paper from his diary, and immediately leaned over a round table and began to write.</p>
<p>In no more than six or seven minutes, a very clear and concise record was in Xiangqi's hands; but it took her more than ten minutes to read it. She read it several times, trying to find some errors in the writing or calligraphy, but the result was exactly the opposite. She just felt that the sentence structure was good, the calligraphy was good, and everything was simply good!</p>
<p>"This opera singer is really strange!" She thought to herself. She couldn't help but glance at him, but unfortunately, Qiu Haitang, who had always been the most self-controlled, was also a little abnormal today, and just happened to be sneaking a sidelong glance at her; as soon as their eyes met, an electrical-like reaction occurred, and both heads involuntarily lowered.</p>
<p>"..." Qiu Haitang wanted to say a few more polite words, but he couldn't say anything at all.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's do it this way!" Xiangqi maintained a very dignified attitude throughout, slowly getting up from the chair, indicating that the conversation was over.</p>
<p>"Then, Madam, may I ask when we can come to hear your reply?" Zhao Si asked without delay.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow afternoon," Xiangqi looked only at Haitang and said, "Please come here again, and I believe I can give you a satisfactory answer."</p>
<p>When Qiu Haitang walked out of the Yuan's house with Zhao Si, he felt very confused, even more confused than before he came. He didn't say a word to Zhao on the way.</p>
<p>"Now we don't have to worry anymore!" Zhao Si couldn't figure out why he was more worried than before the others agreed to help him, so he tried to comfort him. "Listening to Madam Yuan, we will definitely not suffer any more losses. At most, we will give Shen Maazi a few dollars for medical expenses. Don't be afraid of him being fierce!"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang crossed down from the rickshaw silently, as if he hadn't heard, and walked into the hotel; the shadow of a woman had unprecedentedly occupied his entire brain. (49)</p>

<h3>Lamarr Determined to Abandon Saloons</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>"The Pain Bestowed on Her by the Queen of the Beast Kingdom"</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour was indignant, but she didn't throw anything away. Like a lioness, she glared angrily. At first, it was slow, her eyes shone, and she inhaled her cigarette in succession, one puff, two puffs, three puffs. Finally, in the hazy smoke, she poured out:</p>
<p>"When I stepped into Hollywood, wanting to act in gentle and elegant dramas, in my mind I only imagined the decadent night parties, heated rooms, and a pleasant mood in the corner of the film set. But what did I get? I got the horns of the 'Queen of the Beast Kingdom', sitting on the ground in a tent shared by many people, for eight consecutive days in the icy mountain stream. This is the hospitality Hollywood gave me! Every day, I was covered in paint, giving me that beautiful sun-kissed skin. When I returned to the tent at night, all the other extras had arrived before me, so I couldn't get any hot water all day, and I got oil paint poisoning, suffering from alternating chills and fever, and lying in the hospital for a long time.</p>
<p>"Due to the audience's request, I was again arranged to play in 'Moku Lovebirds', even though my body temperature was as high as 103 degrees, I still had to swim. Finally, I fainted. But I still suffered continuous pain, and I didn't know I was injured until the doctor examined me! According to the doctor's report: my injuries were terrible, most of them were sunburns, five places were bitten by orangutans, and there were scratches from lions, tigers, and leopards on my back, three cases of colds, three sprains, twenty-one chills and fevers, and many minor injuries.</p>
<p>"When filming 'Water and Fire Island', it was the most terrible scene of my life." Lamour took a puff of her cigarette and continued, "I was standing there concentrating, and the orangutan I was working with suddenly got angry. It jumped down from a branch thirty feet above the ground and landed on my back, as if struck by lightning. I fell to the ground, and it kicked my waist and raised its giant palm, starting to pound on my chest. Even today, every time I take a deep breath, I feel a slight pain!"</p>
<p>"In the film 'Storm Robbery', I was the target of millions of gallons of water, fanned by wind machines, and washed down from a sixty-foot-high waterfall. Of course, I got a very bad chill. Not only that, but they also turned twenty-five wind machines towards me, which was indescribably embarrassing. I almost lost consciousness. 'Burmese Romance' also gave me many unprecedented hardships. The most terrible thing was that I had to kill a poisonous snake. According to the script, I had to wrap the snake in my dress and then press it to death, like wringing clothes when washing them."</p>
<p>Miss Lamour said wearily and sighed to the sky: "Ah! The fact that I can still live in this world today is all thanks to God's blessing!"</p>
<p>(Translator's Note: According to Hollywood news, after acting in "Burmese Romance", Lamour requested to abandon saloons forever and refused to act in beast movies. However, Paramount recently gave Lamour a new script in which Lamour is still a wild girl who has to fight with beasts. Upon hearing the news, Lamour even burst into tears. She discussed it with her legal counsel, Bauer, and although Bauer spoke softly and kindly, Lamour's determination to refuse the role was firm. What will happen in the future? Let's listen to the next episode.)</p>
<h3>Ginger Rogers Wins Golden Statue Award; Shanghai Radio Film Corporation Hosts Celebration Banquet</h3>
<p>— Li Baolin</p>
<p>The night before yesterday (the 3rd), there was a lively gathering of Shanghai film industry personnel at the Yihong Restaurant on Nanjing Road. It was a special dinner hosted by Mr. Crowter, the person in charge of the Hollywood Radio Pictures Corporation's Shanghai office, to celebrate Ginger Rogers' receipt of last year's Golden Statue Award.</p>
<p>Crowter invited well-known figures from the Shanghai press and film industries. According to him, Rogers' new film, *Kitty Foyle*, has arrived in Shanghai and will be released in Shanghai next month. The film's story is adapted from Christopher Morley's original work. Before filming, Radio Pictures Corporation treated it with a very solemn attitude, and they hesitated and considered for several months before deciding on the leading actress. But in the end, they decided to cast Ginger Rogers because she had changed her style and achieved great success after splitting with Fred Astaire. Taking last year's *Bachelor Mother* as an example, she received very high praise.</p>
<p>After receiving the news that Ginger Rogers had won the Golden Statue Award, the Shanghai Radio Pictures Corporation held a celebration. During the celebration, they also screened the company's recent productions and cartoon shorts. It is said that Li Diyun and Mr. Pan, managers of the Grand Theatre, and senior personnel such as Mr. Butler of the Asia Theatre Company, all attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter One: Where in Life Do We Not Meet</p>
<p>The villager said it was in the small river ahead, so I asked him to guide me to have a look. Thus, I lit a lantern and walked towards the riverbank ahead. When I got there, there was only the gurgling of the river and the sound of the wild wind blowing through the trees. The villager pointed his hand towards the river water about ten steps ahead and said, "Do you see that white light shining from there?" I followed his hand and looked, and indeed there was a faint white light rising from the surface of the water into the sky, even brighter, and constantly appearing to be about to leap. The villager and I stood by the water, watching for a long time, and the white light gradually faded, as faint as a wisp of silk, almost invisible. So we returned to the house. The villager said to me, "I'm afraid this is the spirit of gold and silver, which is why such a white light appeared." I laughed and asked, "Since there is gold and silver in the river, why don't you dredge it?" He said that they were afraid. I smiled and went to sleep. But I thought there must be treasure in the river, and this opportunity should not be missed. So the next day, I asked him to find a few villagers to come with digging tools and we went to the riverbank together. The river water was not very deep, so I taught them to scoop out the water first, dam the upstream, and then start digging. They also thought that there was gold and silver to be obtained, and happily obeyed. After digging for a short time, a villager suddenly felt something in his hand and quickly jumped up to show me. It turned out to be the treasured sword. I then thought of the story of the sword spirit of Fengcheng in ancient times. Although I am not Lei Huan, I am fortunate to have obtained the Frost Blade. Then the white light I saw at night was probably this object. When the villagers dug down again, they found nothing else, and walked up dejectedly saying, "Where is there any gold or silver? There's only this ancient sword. What good is it?" I was secretly delighted in my heart, so I rewarded them with a few taels of silver, took the sword home, fitted it with a scabbard, and practiced with it in my spare time. It was very handy. Wasn't this a matter of chance?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "A treasured sword is hard to come by, and you obtained it so easily. Although it was by chance, it is to be congratulated. Since I have seen your treasured sword, how about I show you mine?" As he spoke, he returned the Scarlet Wind Sword to Xu Jing's hand. He also drew the treasured sword he was wearing, its light shining like frost, its aura like a clear breeze, and held it with both hands for Xu Jing to see, saying, "This sword is named Lingbao. It was made by Cao Pi of Wei and has a considerable history. I got it from a wandering monk." Xu Jing looked at it and also said, "Good sword, good sword." One held a treasured sword, the other held a treasured blade, their light shining brightly on the four walls. As they were admiring them, at the same time, there were two sharp gazes from outside the bamboo fence, shooting towards the window, but neither of them noticed. (End of Chapter One)</p>
