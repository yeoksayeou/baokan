<p>社評</p>
<h3>所謂納粹春季攻勢的剖視</h3>
<p>隨着春季節令的轉趨和暖，現在顯然已是適於侵略國家大舉進攻的時候；一般世人對此之具有戒懼預感，固不待言，即在美海長諾克斯，亦於隔昨聲言全世界較諸九十日前更爲接近戰爭的恐怖。國際間的同盟與民治兩大對立陣綫，最近方在紛事部署，競着先鞭；語其犖犖大者，則美國租借法案甫經通過而付之實施，英方亦結集重軍嚴陣以待；在德國除繼續力向巴爾幹肆其脅迫而外，其潛艇攻勢傳已在加緊進行；在日本於迫令法越對泰屈伏之餘，松岡一行旋即登程赴德，作卅五年來破天荒的國外聘問。這些事實，無疑都會使人們在沉重心靈之上更籠罩了一層暗影。世局若此，誠無取於一味畏怯自欺，諱言來日危機的嚴重；但在理智的諦視之下，深感侵略國家雖依舊聲勢煊赫，先聲逼人，然已不能盡掩其盛極而衰的頹勢；跡其實際，則雖有必逞之勢，而並非勝算在握。現在雖然同樣是春天，如果說納粹軍隊會再演去年春夏之間那種奇跡，則已沒有任何人敢予相信。</p>
<p>所謂春季攻勢一名詞，一方面因爲有去年往事的經驗，一方納粹當局亦復一再以此揚言，是以中人至深，甚至有人竟因而懷有這即將是最後決戰的意想。就納粹最近處境形勢而言，他自然不能坐視民治國實力的日益增長與自身聲威的衰落，並且他已往的準備和措置，都並未爲長期作戰打算，是以可信所謂的未來攻勢當不是徒託空言，所成爲問題的只是這一攻勢將在何處用何方式發動。爲納粹設想，其最大目標自然是擊潰英國，但飛渡英倫海峽的困難似乎迄今仍舊是納粹當局最大的煩惱。去秋所標榜着的空中攻勢已成爲民治國的嘲笑資料，如其不能從皇家空軍手中奪得英倫三島的制空權，所謂發動萬數千架飛機把英倫夷爲平地的大言終僅是幻想。更以最近所侈言的潛艇攻勢而言，固然是英方從海外取得食料資源的嚴重威脅，但德方亦非長期作有效的運甩，不足坐困英國，何况在英國還繼續統馭着波臣之際，總難設想單靠潛艇的剽襲就能促成大英帝國的崩潰。至於德軍將由巴爾幹以窺中東之說，更不能不予以極大保留；因爲那樣樹敵愈多，實力愈分，亦非極忌兩面作戰的德國之利。其最近的竭力經營巴爾幹，如果那並不是聲東擊西，恐怕主要還是為了綏靖後方並充實自身的經濟實力，固然壓迫希臘停戰也容或是德方且標之一，但却不要忽略希特勒之向着多瑙河流域發展，實遠在義希戰爭以前。其未來攻勢的發動，當小能外於上述諸端，然而無論其採取那一種運用。抑或多方並進，都沒有絕對制勝的把握。在最近半載的歲月當中，納粹方面所應付的主要對象是法國西班牙與巴爾幹，對英倫三島始終未能作有效的一擊，這種弱點的暴露，最近連蘇聯軍方都予以肯定的承認，而在這樣長久的相持之中，德方的軍心民氣是吾會和一年以前英法那樣的由緊張而漸趨弛懈，也正是一個值得注意的問題。</p>
<p>德國經營歐洲大陸的成功，並不能抵銷其在歐陸以外的失敗；最近美國的擴大建立國防，實施租借法案，都應該算是德國自身對外運用所引起來的後果。即以歐陸而言：對法西兩國的企圖迄今無所成就，蘇德之間最近復以保國附德而發生微妙的變化，置身於這樣一個複雜局勢之間，其無數難題絕不是僅恃所謂春季攻勢所能解決。松岡一行的赴歐，也許是納粹另一個重大期望所寄託，在日本處境，也和德國同具速謀一逞的需求；然而今日的民治國家對於這一方面，也早已在嚴重戒備之下，準備應付任何可能發生的事變，這又何嘗是侵略國家有利的出路呢！</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（卅九）　春季攻勢前夕　德國實力再檢討</h3>
<p>這篇是紐的泰晤士報的紀載，茲譯錄於後：</p>
<p>入春以來，希特勒已再一向世人宣布說，他確信德國在一九四一年內必可獲得勝利。據德官塲的意見，他出此言，確有把握，並非徒事虛聲恫嚇，其中最重要的因素，就是德國龐大的戰爭機構的攻擊力量。</p>
<p>據希特勒說，德軍今日配備精良，實力雄厚，在德國軍事歷史上，可稱得未曾有。波蘭斯干秋那維半島，和西歐的幾决戰役，眞是德國參謀部的絕好機會，使德軍能以比較輕微的損失，獲得寳貴的作戰經騐。</p>
<p>同時，德國在道三决短期戰爭中所損失的配備，已在被征服各國獲得各種軍用品，儘足補償之而有餘。即如以法國而論，德軍所獲的全副配備，足供一百師以上軍隊之用，其他積存的貴重原料，尙未計算在內。此外，德國工業，自戰爭開始之日起，即經完全調整，以通合戰時需要。英國空軍的轟炸，據說對於德國工業，並沒有重大損害。</p>
<p>德方自謂兵力現已達到最高峯，假使此言果確，今日主要的問題，即在德軍果將向何處發動，以實施其致命的打擊。當然，此爲軍事秘密，然據柏林里巷閒談，皆謂德軍將領深信英國將被打敗，並且可以打敗，以意推之，當然係指英倫三島而言。</p>
<p>以前柏林方面，曾經反覆申說過，德軍進攻英倫三島的勝利，即是大不列顛帝國的崩潰。近來却不再聽到此說，這是很可注意的一事。希特勒最近的演說，固然是着重在巴爾幹，但他是吾因義大利的失敗，專爲此問題而發，却很難說</p>
<p>德國所最注意的，無疑地是英倫三島。據希特勒說，一到春季，即將對英採取潛艇攻勢，德國飛機，亦將表示空軍司令部和飛機工業，在冬季並沒有沉睡不醒。據德國人說，假使英倫三島陷落，而英國仍繼續作戰，欲以英國海軍單獨之力，或與另一國合力封鎖歐洲，則將令四千萬英人有絕食之憂。</p>
<p>又據德國人說，他們對於英倫三島的地位，已佔着繼續作戰的絕人優勢。今日與一九一七年完全不同，當時美國參戰之際，還有一個强大的法國，現在可不然，英國在大陸上的軍事據點，早已消減。德國大小各種艦艇，自挪威直至西班牙，都有根據地可以利用，而他們的空軍，又可自沿海機塲出發，以困擾英國的海陸兩方面。</p>
<p>希特勒曾向德國人民保證，一九四一年將爲「歐洲新秩序」在歷史上可紀念的一年。當美國國會正在討論「租借法案」之時，華盛頓和倫敦方面，都有關於德國陸空軍實力的估計，並發出警吿說，喧傳已有十個月的侵英戰事，現在快要達到最重要階段了。</p>
<p>一班觀察家都預料德國一到春季，即將企圖進攻英倫，以至愛爾蘭和冰島。倫敦方面則亦自信有擊退敵軍的能力，華盛頓方面雖不如英國這樣的放心，但也很覺樂觀。相信德軍佔優勢的，祇有少數人。但是無論如何，德國侵英之舉。一旦果然實現，則其攻勢的猛烈，必將達到空前程度，這已是人所共認的了。</p>
<p>德軍實力的强弱，組織的成分，以及運用的性質，似皆在猜測不定之中。華盛頓方面的報吿，初說德國有飛機七萬架，其後降至三萬六千架。據英國方面的估計，德國陸軍現有二百二十五師。這許多報吿，沒有一條可以說是精確。德軍實在的力量。只有德國人自己知道，然而的略估計，總是可能的。德國兵力，無疑的已達到最高峯。若作相對的統計，則今日德國對英的實力，殆較去年九月對英法波三國的實力有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>從軍事上說，德國實力，以陸軍爲主。這是全球最强大的睦軍，人數在三百五十萬至四百二十二萬五千之間，共編成二百五十個師團，其中至少有二百個步兵師，一半是訓練完善的精銳。此外還有十個至二十個裝甲師團，每師附有戰車四百五十輛，與十個至十二個摩托化師團，一個騎兵師團，還有山地部隊，空軍陸戰隊，和降落傘隊各若干師</p>
<p>德軍鑒於法蘭德一役的經騐，或者已把這許多軍隊整理改編，重行配備。假使英德兩軍在陸地再決雌雄，英國所遇到的德軍，戰車和平射砲，其威力必將更勝於一九四〇年吧</p>
<p>這許多軍隊的配置，現尙未能知悉。開入羅馬尼亞的德軍人數，自十萬至二十五萬，估計各異，大的不會超過八師或十師。在波蘭沿蘇聯邊界！或有大軍駐防，維也納區亦有數師，在義大利和西班牙，或者亦有若干德軍，特別是空軍的陸上步隊。挪威駐有戌軍，荷蘭比利時與法國佔領區內，更有重兵駐紮，在德國本土還有軍隊正在訓練中。</p>
<p>這些不能調動的軍隊至多有一百師，甚或不及此數。假使德國要侵犯央倫，當然有一百萬精銳可用。</p>
<p>空軍是德國第二實力。其芷確力量如何亦是衆說紛紜。但英國對於華盛頓所傳七萬或三萬六千架的估計，却並不相信，其實僅衆數字而不加詮釋，是無意義的。因爲各大强國的空軍，若將練習機和非戰鬥機計算在內，都將以數萬架計</p>
<p>若將此類飛機，一併包括在內，則德國機數自可達到三萬六千架上下。但若僅以實際作戰的飛機衡量其實力，則德機決不會有三萬六千架之數。據可靠的估計，德國今日作戰的飛機，總數的在五千至七千五百架之間。唯目前尙未參加戰事的後備機數或在一倍以上，可於短時期中使德國空軍實力增加到一萬架至一萬五千架之數。</p>
<p>未來的英倫之戰，共結果或即繫於德國飛機的數量，但其多寡問題至今猶聚訟莫決。去秋，德國對英實施空軍閃電戰，在一個白天中，英國空軍雖祇有飛機一千架到二千架，但它們奮勇防禦，卒使德方攻勢失敗。</p>
<p>當時指揮英國空軍戰鬥部隊現在美國負有重大使命的英國空軍參謀長杜定爵士曾公開官稱，他相信那時德空軍已全郁出動。旣已運用最大的空軍力量，此後將永不能控制英倫上空了。假使這話果確，那麽關於德機數目方面的傳述，顯屬渲染過甚。</p>
<p>但是美多數觀察家，對於杜定爵士之言，却不免表示懷疑，即英國觀察家中亦有若干人不以爲然。他們覺得德國近來正在小心謹愼地作空軍戰術的大規模試騐。自從去年十一月以來，德國即集中全力，提高飛機和駕駛員的實力，並創製新機，俾在質的方面能與英機相抗。</p>
<p>德國海軍的實力雖有增加，但除非英國的大部份海軍被沉海底，德艦隊決不能推翻英國的制海權。</p>
<p>德國在今日大概有戰艦四艘，即三萬五千噸或三萬七千五百噸的俾斯麥克級新戰艦兩艘，（可與英國的喬治五世級彼此匹敵，）和二萬六千噸裝有十一吋徑砲的香霍斯脫級戰艦兩艘。袖珍戰艦亦尙有兩艘存在，航空母艦或已完成一兩艘，此外並有驅逐艦四十七艘，潛水艇的一百二十艘，這是最可畏的武器。</p>
<p>德國在建造中的潛水艇或有一百八十至二百艘之多，這種新艇的製造率，每月大的有六艘至十五艘。據希特勒在演說中的暗示，德國將採取大規模潛艇攻勢，以封鎖英國，這種攻勢，說不定便是侵犯英倫三島的前奏吧。</p>

<p>警務當局　臨時搜檢</p>
<p>兩租界警務當局、自六日開始普通戒備以來、昨因正値革命紀念日、故前晚起加緊戒備工作、公共租界工部局並於十一日晚八時許、派遣紅色警　車二輛、及中西印後備隊百餘名、全副武裝、在虞洽卿路福州路口·及廣　路口一帶、搜檢各大旅館及馬路車輛行人、一方整日派遺萬國商團及大批探捕巡仃各馬路、至於滬西區域、並由鐵甲車梭巡、法租界當局亦採同一步驟、故在當局嚴密警備下、此偉大紀念令節得以安渡、聞當局此項措施、決延長至十五日爲止、惟屆時仍施行必要之普通警備、</p>
<h3>滬崴通航　尙難實現</h3>
<p>行駛上海海參崴航綫之蘇聯輪船、自八一三事變發生後、即自動停航、至今已逾三載、上月中曾有Smolny馬司耐號、及Komiles柯梅拉斯號兩俄輪、連袂來滬修理、馬司耐號業已工竣出塢、赴小呂宋轉道回返海參崴、各情已誌前報、茲據廣東路五十一號二樓鴻運航務局宣稱、近續有俄輪來滬修理、Sovet蘇凡脫號已於前日（十一日）抵滬、停泊和豐船廠碼頭、等候人塢修葺、另有MaxinDorks高爾基號、係與蘇凡脫號回來、因高爾基號機件損壞、抵長江口洞沙領江登輪處拋泊、蘇凡脫號先行來滬、鴻運航務局特僱馬勒公司拖輪二艘往拖、高爾基號亦於昨晨進口、停泊和豐船廠碼頭、日內即將入塢修理、至外傳俄輪復航滬崴（海參崴）錢一節、據該公司稱、來滬之各輪、均係修理性質、對復航事、全無所聞、恐最近難以實現、將來如何未能預料、</p>
<h3>去夏來滬之英巨輪　慘遭擊沉</h3>
<p>歐洲第二决大戰發生以來、對雙方商輪犧牲者甚多、過去迭誌報端、沂聞英商太子輪船公司中歐綫內之Mu　SiamesePrlnce號輪、載重八千四百五十六噸、近在歐遭德潛艇攻擊、已受損沉沒、船員祇有十餘人遇救出險、大部份船員、已沉沒海底、太子公司行駛遠東綫船隻、共有六艘、原由怡泰公司經理、自怡泰公司船務部轉讓、現由怡和洋行代理、該輪於去年五月十日到滬、十四日由滬赴美轉道回英、被微應差、至今遭此不幸事件、</p>
<h3>越界築路地段　車輛執照問題　工部局表示決定辦法</h3>
<p>工部局發言人昨日吿記者稱、工部局與「市府」方面現正進行關於越界築路車輛同時備有公共租界及「市府」一種執照問題之談判、然截至昨日、雙方對該問題尙未有所決定、談判結果如何、目下亦不能發表、按工部局發言人此言係對某晚報所載「特警總署長」潘志傑稱不久以後、車輛行經越界築路時、須同時備有二種執照之言而發、</p>
<p>潘達所談兩種照會</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、西區「特警總署署長」潘達、今（十二日）晨在其寓所晤記者談稱、行駛滬西界外馬路區之一切車輛、不久皆須懸公共租界與「市」方兩種照會、僅懸一種者、不論其爲公共租界抑係「市」方之照會皆不足、潘達又述及「特警隊」之職務稱、渠當就其權力、恢復西區之正常狀態、並當採取步驟、禁止界外馬路區之罪惡、按潘達將於星期五晨在大西路五十七號A（前英軍營）宣誓、正式就「總署長」職、</p>
<h3>上海華人　外流資金　共的十三萬萬元</h3>
<p>據金融界消息、上海華人資金之存於外商銀行者、約國幣十三萬萬元、其中爲華商銀行所有者、爲國幣一萬六千萬元、華人資金存於香港者、約港幣六萬萬元、私人資金存在美國者、的美金二萬萬元至三萬萬元、戰後國人資金有大部份、係以美國爲外府、</p>
<h3>美租借法案成立後　上海所呈反應　美在遠東更增力量與威望　西報評松岡聯蘇願望難成</h3>
<p>關於美國羅斯福總統簽署租借法案事、文大美晚報記者、昨向各界探詢本市之反響、據某美商聲稱、美總統簽署租偕案而予英國以援助、對於美國在遠東之地位、必將更增力量與威望、溯自中日戰爭爆發以還、美國在遠東之商業、已受重大影響、今美國通過租借案、必將使美國商業受一新刺激、而美國在遠東之地位、亦必因加强援英之結果、而獲更大之力量與威望云、某日僑咋（十二日）晨聲稱租借案之簽署、乃一甚重要之事、縱在短期內或不見其重要性、但對美德兩國久之必有影響、日僑方面對租借案之通過、不感驚奇、以其乃意中事也云、同時本市金融界對租借案之簽署、縱有反響、亦甚微弱、本市證券市塲各股票依然堅挺、昨晨證票市價與昨日之水準、殆無變動、又昨晨滙市亦穩定、美滙仍爲前日收盤價、買進十七元七角七分、賣出十八元三角九分、</p>
<p>松岡赴歐　殆將失望</p>
<p>大陸報評論云、日本頻送秋波、希冀與蘇聯成立互不侵犯條約、爲時幾達一年、但莫斯科方面並不因日本之花言巧語與裝腔做勢、而有動於中、其實日本並非眞有所愛於蘇聯、亦非欲向蘇聯工廠中取得任何物質上之協助、日本所需要者、乃在取得一種保證、即當其伸展其勢於南亞細亞而實行其南進計劃時、務使無人尾擊其後也、故日本感覺此項條的之需要、從未有如今日之迫切者、</p>
<p>開始進行野心計劃</p>
<p>日本之作戰軍隊、正在越南與泰國鞏固其地位、今後即將開始其自有歷史以來最野心之帝國建造計劃、在其目光中、新加坡·荷屬東印度及其他附近土地、已似極成熟可採之果實、但以蘇聯虎視眈眈於後、故正硏究如何方能採得、日本最狡猾之外交家、屢圖移去此種威脅、但結果均已吿束手、現則必將由外相松岡洋右一試其幸運、</p>
<p>此行目的在莫斯科</p>
<p>松岡之赴歐、原爲欲與柏林之納粹領袖與羅馬之法西期領袖有所會議、但其旅程中最重要之一部份、顯爲在赴德或返國之途中、將在莫斯科與莫洛托夫或史丹林一晤、倘能與蘇聯訂立一不侵犯條的、則將爲其個人一生事業中最大之勝利、松岡欲獲得此項夢寐以求之條約、雖在可能之範圍以內、但吾人殊願勸其切勿過於樂觀、</p>
<p>德日强大寗爲蘇願</p>
<p>松岡本人爲一精明之觀察家、吾人深伺其對於此行之任務、必不存過甚之奪望也、蘇聯對於西隣德國與　隣日本、實不願冉見其增强、因德日兩國均爲其可能之敵人、若令二國利用互不侵犯條的、而分別在歐亞兩洲各自稱雄則將置蘇聯於何地、蓋旣有蘇聯橫梗於其閒、而所謂「世界新秩序」終於不能完成也德國之勸誘、對於松岡此行、將無大效用、據最近所有之微象、莫斯科與柏林之關係、已失去不少原有之熱誠、莫斯科對保加里亞向德屈服一事、其態度已非德蘇合作之徵衆、而蘇聯紅星報盛讚英國之戰力與戰略等社論、當非討好希特勒而作、僅此二事、已足以說明松岡欲謀與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條約、殊非易事、</p>
<h3>國際飯店勞資糾紛　圓滿解決　前晚曾怠工三小時</h3>
<p>靜安寺路一六四號國際大飯店所屬全體職工四百餘人、向資方要求改善待遇、前晚曾於七時半起、一度怠工三小時、其時除該店電話照常通話、及電梯暫開一部外，餘均停止工作、站立原位、秩序井然、該店資方鑒於如此局面、爰邀請公共租界政治部派員調處、當局准其所請、於昨日下午二時委派李弼軍陸偉康偕同外籍Damemenis專赴該店、資方代表林某、勞方代表宋建初盛幼棠應瑞庭曹登贏顧洲煊五人、經調解結果、資方當塲　受勞方所提要求、該項糾紛今已圓滿解決、茲探錄其解決條文如下、（一）民國二十九年度之原有津貼改爲正式薪金、（二）自本年一月份起、每人每月津貼照下列增多、（甲）薪金最低者津貼百分之一百三十五、（乙）决低者津貼百分之一百、（丙）中等者津貼百分之七十八、（丁）最高者津貼百分之五十七，餘即附件從略、</p>
<h3>靑年會徵求會開幕　目的十五萬元</h3>
<p>上海靑年會、爲一純粹服務社會之團體、自創立迄今、已歷四十一年、其閒經過中內人士之苦心努力、慘淡經營、逐年均有相當進展、入會會友、亦異常發達、該會每年例有徵友運動、前日（十一日）中午十二時、該會在八仙橋會所舉行第四十一屆徵求大會開幕典禮、蒞會者共逮五百餘人、大都爲各界知名人士、濟濟一堂、頗稱盛舉、席間由丁貴堂主席致開會辭、全紹文梁小初相繼演說、語多精警、來賓無不振奮、决由陸高誼代表徵求會執行委員會報吿徵求會組織情形、宋由全體唱聯誼歌、至二時禮成散會、聞該會此决徵求、規模之大、爲歷來所未有、其組織係分委員會徵求隊二大組、委員的一百五十人、徵求隊計一百隊、共的一千五百人、目的爲會費十萬兀、捐款五萬元、此數雖較以往加增、但每隊目的仍爲一千元、則爲往年無異、至於揭曉日期、第一次爲三月十四日、第二决二十一日、第三决二十八日、第四决總揭曉爲叫月四日、該徵求會即於是日閉幕、並聞委員會與徵求隊、均各踴躍推動、按之往年該會徵求成續、本屆目的當不難達到也、</p>
<h3>研究電力分配　即將召集會議　工部局已延攬專家三人　將就各種工業功能分配</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處公吿云、「關於用電供給問題，本局刻已徵得李振南博士·梅斯及豐川良之助君等三人之同意、允予會同上海電力公司代表、研究電力供給之分配辦法、」按梅斯爲本市著名之工程師、曾任濬浦局技術顧問多年、在本市工業方面、甚有權戚、李振南博士供職中國銀行、爲舉國聞名之統計專家、在工業界中、且有悠久之歷史、民國十六年獲得博士學位後、即任美國密希根州庇特律地方通用汽車公司經濟研究部統計員、及紐的標準統計局硏究部經濟硏究科科長、據咋日所知、該委員會將於週末前、召集首决會議、其第一步工作、將根據各種工業在社會上之功能、分類列爲若干不同之集團、一俟此項工作完成、然後就煤斤供給情形、分配各該集團之用電量、法商水電公司職員昨日語記者稱、法租界减節電流問題、現　續討論中、</p>

<h3>日光節約運動　難望推行盡利　各方聲述理由表示反對　鐘點撥快不若提早辦公</h3>
<p>上海華商工廠主對於市政當局從星期日起推行之日光節的時間、不加贊同、故不致予以採行，因上海大多數工廠現皆每日二十四小時晝夜開工也、某某四工廠主昨日（十二日）晤記者時、切實聲明彼等不喜日光節的辦法，故彼等所設工廠、不致受此辦法之影響、</p>
<p>提早開工種種不便</p>
<p>若干工廠於侵晨六時開工者、若再予提早，則工人上工時將以遇路刦爲懼、多數工廠均設西區、而目下西區工人淸晨赴廠時、恒有被刦之虞、允以女工爲最、再者、苟工廠早班提早一小時工作、天色未曙、勢須利用電燈、實有背日光節的、節省用電之旨趣、</p>
<p>强烈反對亦有理由</p>
<p>江海關當局對於已定星期六午夜起實行之日光節的辦法、拒不置評、滙豐銀行某員則謂該行本年諒將復行此辦法、但行方對此尙未商得確切決議、又上海電力公司某員稱、該公司將從星期日起實行此有益於整個市民之辦法、按去歲十一月日光節的終止時、記者曾從事調查、藉悉貧苦階級之華人、因日光節的减少共賺錢之可能性、故加强烈之反對、而本市夜總會中人、連同舞女在內、亦竭力反對此舉、以改變時閒、影響營業也、</p>
<p>列舉弊害請予考慮</p>
<p>昨有本報讀者趙深吉君來函云、敬啟者、今日報載工部局情報處公吿、自本月十五日午夜起，開始日光節的運動云云、查自去年推行該運動後、有關各方、早已洞察其利弊所在、毋庸贅述、而工廠工人反蒙其害、爰略述其梗概、以爲將伯之呼籲、</p>
<p>勞工方面</p>
<p>工廠職工每日上工時間、旣在上午六時、或甚至五時前必須到廠、遲到則作爲曠工論、當日工資即發生問題、試問處此生活指數高於極點之時、豈薪水階級者所能忍受，故不得不勉强準時報到、然廠方旣不供給宿舍、又無車輛代步、勢非在到廠前一小時起身不可自鐘點撥快之後、不得不更提早一小時起身、因此頓時减短睡眠時間、更不得不由睡夢中跳起、結果多耗電費、又受精神之痛苦、遑論工作之效率矣、嘗有不瞭解之資本家囿於規定工作鐘點不顧實在時候不准通融、以致剝奪工人利益、甚至有少數資方、反得藉口强制延長工作時間、此豈倡導者之本意乎、工廠職工、終日勞作、入晚必惓而思眠、在夏日工人因待遇菲薄、不得不合多人雜居於簡陋斗室之中、晚問暑氣未散、不能入睡、更以臭蟲業集、通夜滋擾、難能安睡、直至午夜方得成睡、剎那間即須起身趕往工廠、結果因睡眠不足、精神萎靡、其影響於工人身體健康者、實非淺鮮、</p>
<p>時間提早</p>
<p>日光節約運動之宗旨、旣在激發朝氣、鍜鍊體魄、增進工作效能、則可提早辦工時間、覺非異曲同工、母須撥快鐘點、而撥快鐘點反有害於工人、去年滬上同時有二種鐘點、致引起種種不便、貴報爲社會之喉舌、敢請俯察下情、促工部局之注意、對於撥快鐘點一事、加以考慮、則勞工之感激者、必大有人在也、專此敬上申報館台鑒、趙深吉敬啟、三月十二日、</p>

<h3>金市緩步前進</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤續趨高檔、兩度拉出六千三百元關外、而各幫人心穩重、反動甚微、故高低相差不過四十餘元、論經過仍示迂迥盤旋之　、至大戶買戶亦無顯著、祇大豐於高時每售、而德孚雖吐亦少、但新豐永及恒記進意較殷、故曾抬高至六千三百十五元、午收結果爲六千三百元、比隔昨升三十元、半日交易尙旺、的一萬兩、下午週三無市、現金由合盛售予恒記十兩、照期交價高四百五于元、時和出祥和一百兩、高四百四十允、飾金關金等均平、</p>

<h3>我叛了！</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>我不知應當如何提筆開始寫，一個初中畢業而輟學的女子能寫些什麽呢？可是無論如何，我得將一切發表出來。閒話別說先談我的父親吧。無論那位間我：「你的父親是什麽樣的人？』我必以『殘忍」二字回答他。父親是從小在封建制度下長大的，也許至今還是提倡封建制度最激烈，曾經在某縣做過縣長，當然揩油也揩得不少。在富裕的環境中，母親愛我如命，我是她唯一的女兒，所以一切物質上的享受是很使我滿足的；只是頑固的父親，待我們母女倆非常冷淡。不知是什麽理由，也許另有愛人，我們也無從知道。因爲母親是一個「三從四德」的老式女子，只要有吃有穿，一切從不查問。</p>
<p>當我十五歲的時候，唯一愛我的母親，因中風而死，父親也就娶了一個三十多歲的女子，就是我那陰險的繼母。她非但不愛我，而且恨我。十七歲的那年，我初中才畢業，繼母就挑撥着父親，不許我升學了。那時我沒有絲毫勇氣反抗，只得唯唯服從。除了姨母－——母親的親妹妹——以外，簡直沒有親人，孤零零的我，一到傍晚，只有眼淚陪伴着。無意中，我認識了一個靑年男子，我們從友誼而各自相戀着。我愛他，他也愛我。可是不幸的事往往會降落在我身上。我倆的事，被機母覺察了。當然免不了吿訴父親，他怒不可遏，大駡我不要臉；並對我說：『無論如何你不能愛他。』我也怒極了，說道：『無論誰都不愛，只愛他。』因此父女間的隔膜更見深了。</p>
<p>在父親嚴禁之下，我們常私下見面。可是每在一起，總是提心吊膽的。我得不到快樂，我小能再在這黑暗的家庭中生活，我的確不能忍耐了，它會逼死我的。我還年靑，我要活，因此耍跳出這牢籠。</p>
<p>靑春之火然燒着，惡劣的環境逼迫着，我叛了，同封建制度反抗，從此不願冉做它的奴隸。在一個天氣明朗的春季午後，那時我也達到了法律的年齡，跟着愛人離開了父親走了。近年來開了一家規模相當大的食品店，營業很發達，我們的生活也永遠是愉快的。可是我總有一種莫名的恐懼，將來我那三歲的女兒長大了，被人稱爲『私生子』，她將如何的看輕她的父母，如何怨恨她的父母呢？因着父母犯法的結合，而使她得了這寃在的罪名，可是道眞眞的罪人到底是誰呢？</p>

<h3>怎樣處逆境？</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>逆境詮釋</p>
<p>逆境就是　人生大道中，所可能遇着的艱險，阻碍，失敗，損失，煩惱，痛苦，憂慮，徬徨。……總之，凡一切違反我們志願的事情，統統可以包括在內。至於偷兒行竊未遂，强盜謀刦未成等，不能視爲逆境，因其已背離人生眞正的目標故。無論怎樣，人生斷不能無逆境，允其是處身在目今的環境裏。那麽，試問當逆境來臨時，我們要怎樣應付呢？</p>
<p>縮减欲望</p>
<p>美國大哲William　Lames，在他的名著心理學簡編中說：『人生的感覺滿意與吾，是拿「成功」和「欲望」作比例的。成功如分子，欲望如分母：我們加增成功的成分，結果可以得到較大的滿意；可是我們縮减欲望的成分，結果也何嘗不是一樣呢？（成功十欲望＝滿意）』準此至理名言以談：事情的威功與吾，那時常要看機緣過合，要受環境的支配，我們人是不能說有絕對的把握的。可是我們自己的欲望，我們却直接能够加以控制，加以减縮。所以我們不要妄想，不要希冀非分，不要『癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝力，緊緊的把握住現實。更要記淸：在人生的大道上，『失敗是常法，成功是例外。』凡事要在事前把種種失敗的可能性加以預計，加以推測：這樣可以避免過份的失望。</p>
<p>鎭靜忍耐</p>
<p>逆境不是常常可以逆睹的，有的是猝不及防，忽然來臨，俗所謂『閉門家中坐，禍從天上來』者是也。所以我們遇事要鎭靜，也要忍耐。因爲張皇失措，只有更加增事態的嚴重性；不安心忍耐，也只有把痛苦弄的更尖銳化，於事實無所補益。鎭靜能叫我們從絕路中找出生路來，應付危機，忍耐能叫我們把大痛苦化爲小痛苦，穩渡難關！不過道需要多加練習，多加培養。</p>
<p>彌闕補過</p>
<p>逆境假若是由我們自己的過失所招致的，那麼，就更不該去怨天允人了，相反的，這倒是我們反躬自省，彌闕補過的一種絕好機會：我們要隨時隨地接受事實的好敎訓！我們要把自已的過失缺點等，反覆思維，以便痛自針砭，改絃更張，以新的努力，去完成我們人生的大任務！</p>
<p>道德人格</p>
<p>我所說的縮减欲望主義，不是叫人偷生苟安，毫無上進的志向；我所說的鎭靜忍耐政策，也不是叫人屈節卑躬，甘過奴隸的生活！相反的，第一項，祗是叫人不作不能兌現的幻想；第二項，忍耐也自有一定的限度，此限度的雷池，一步不容擅越也。忍耐限度的界綫，應求之於道德律，求之於我們那神聖不可侵犯的人格，我們的一切要以社會人羣的福利爲依歸</p>

<h3>無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 熊</p>
<p>歷史上的所謂央雄，多數是殺人不眨眼的魔王，但是他們的名字常常被人們提起，被人們作爲尊敬與讚美的對象。而那些對于人羣有莫大的功績的人，他們的名字却早已被人們遣忘了，像一陣輕烟一樣地被遺忘了。</p>
<p>人們常常提起拿破崙，提起成吉思汗，誇讚他們的戰績，尊崇他們做英雄。是爲了他們曾救活了多少人的生命嗎？還是因爲他們曾改進了人類的生活呢？都不是的，他們對於人羣並沒有什麼了不得的貢獻；祗因爲他們曾掀起了殘酷的戰爭，驅策無數無辜的人們在沙塲上流了血，犧牲了生命，他們自己因此獲得了萬人主宰的地位，所以他們就出了名，成功了英雄，受到人們的崇敬和誇耀。</p>
<p>自從琴納發明以種痘的方法預防天花以來，眞不知有多少孩子的性命被救活了；自從巴斯德發現傳染病的原因由於細菌作祟，並因此創始了預防和療治的方法以後，無量數的人避免了死亡的命運。他們對於人羣的貢獻不能說不偉大。但是他們的名反不及那些殺人的魔王。如今有多少人還記得他們的名字呢？</p>
<p>人沒有不好名的，人人都想在世上建樹一些事業，以得到後世的紀念。於是，聰明的人都爭先去學那些殺人的魔王——所謂央雄，希望自己的名字和那些英雄們同樣地被後世的人們常常提起，作爲尊敬與讚美的對象。剩下來祗有傻子去追隨那些人類的恩人，去爲人羣造福。</p>
<p>然而那些英雄們死後，所遺留在世界上的只不過是一個空虛得可憐的名而已！那些儍子們却留下了眞實的不可磨滅的功績；他們的恩澤被於人羣，一直到永遠。他們是無名英雄，是眞正的英雄！</p>

<h3>羣英會的舞劍</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>「羣英會」的舞劍，　說始自徐小香，後傳王楞仙，再傳某票友及程繼仙蕭長華，後軸中徐碧雲茹富蘭皆擅長此技。且仍依舊路。葉盛蘭之舞劍爲茹富蘭所授，經過程繼仙之指正。李德彬殊不弱，蓋亦曾請益於程樅仙者。今徐碧雲淪落西北，此調不彈久矣。茹富蘭雖懷絕技，限於嗓子，聲譽反爲葉　蘭所掩；其實盛蘭之劍法，不依老路。耍翎，奪步，爲「八大錘」「岳家莊」所有，盛蘭皆插入於舞劍中，火熾固渝於老路，共如此類娃娃牛的動作，用於年輕氣盛的周公瑾身上，不合要求何？以言劍術，程繼仙後推茹富蘭；茹富蘭後數李德彬。葉盛蘭已是自成一派。周維俊高維廉爲金仲仁之徒，金與王又荃，在今日小生行中，亦屬老角，雖有舞劍，技殊軟弱，不足稱也。維廉徘俊更難得好評矣。</p>
<p>以情理而論，雙劍宜於旦角，小生用之，實嫌脂粉氣。據說先前本用單劍，自徐小香用雙劍後，後輩宗之（徐本唱日後改小生），耍單劍不見於紅氍毺上者久矣。南方小金台科班出身之趙瑞棠，此人在民十以前，曾隸老共舞台，擅長刀馬旦，後因倒嗓，以說戲糊口。趙之所說「羣英會」，即舞單劍者。曾見厲家班坤角厲慧敏「羣英會」周瑜劇影，亦爲單劍。</p>
<p>此戲中之舞劍與梅程尙徐所舞之劍路，表面似同，實則大異。蓋旦角劇中之舞劍，其身段，步子，劍路，皆受制於胡琴，獨「羣英會」小生之舞劍，用哨吶牌子爲引，中國起走馬鑼鼓，轉急急風，塲面由舞劍者支配，近乎「翠屛山」之耍刀，「天堂州」之要　；但收束時又有分判，似難於「別姬一之劍法，實則比「別姬」所舞之劍爲易耳。</p>

<h3>改良崑曲之我見</h3>
<p>— 宋瑞楠</p>
<p>音樂和武打</p>
<p>我總感覺到崑曲樂器太單純，也太嘈雜。所以一方面要儘量引用中國的樂器，並在可能範圍中引用西洋樂器（但不可太歐化，吾則要變成不調和的），使牠有感情，有變化，發生加强效果的作用。同時，嘈雜的樂器如大鼓，大鑼，喇叭等等，少用爲妙。至於武打的塲面，也愈少愈好。元劇中描寫戰爭往往以探子的報吿軍情替代，這是値得效法的一點。固然，有許多武打是很合「金鼓」的節奏的，可是武打是代表生死的決鬥，如今竟變成韻律化」，這是不合情理的。</p>
<p>佈景</p>
<p>佈景不但可以加强氛圍，並且可以使觀衆更易了解劇本的背景和內容，不過耍記得，佈景不是機關，吾則要變成海派京戲了。至於燈光，也很可以利用。</p>
<p>上而所寫的，全是我這外行人所說的話，可是客觀的事實逼我不能不說些一知半解的話，謬誤之處，定不在少，但也不過希望能以此引起一般愛好崑曲和致力劇運的同志之注意，大家提出意見討論一下，允共希望內行人能够多多提供意見，並能够大胆實騐一下。固然，失敗是免不了的，可是根據失敗的經騐冉度改造，即可糾正以至成功，即使最後仍然失敗，然而總要比坐視崑曲沒落的好。　（完）</p>

<h3>U.S. President Signs Lend-Lease Act; Followed by Financial Conference; Decides to Request $7 Billion Appropriation from Congress; House to Vote on Defense Spending Bill</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt officially signed the Lend-Lease Act yesterday evening and immediately initiated mechanisms to aid Britain. The bill was sent directly to the White House after the House approved the Senate's amendments. After signing, President Roosevelt immediately held a meeting with several congressional leaders, deciding to request $7 billion in cash from Congress to aid democratic nations under the act. The congressional leaders who consulted with Roosevelt left after an hour. This $7 billion request will include the President's authority under the Lend-Lease Act to provide democratic nations with ready-made war materials and army supplies valued at $1.3 billion. The House will vote within a few days on the $9 billion defense spending bill, which does not include the $7 billion requested by the President. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – After the House passed the Senate-amended Lend-Lease Act yesterday by a vote of 317 to 71, Vice President Wallace and Speaker of the House Rayburn signed it and sent it to the White House overnight, where President Roosevelt signed it into law. Roosevelt also held another meeting after the financial conference to discuss administrative plans for implementing aid to Britain. Secretary of War Stimson, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Chief of Staff were all invited to attend. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>U.S. Aircraft and Ships to Be Immediately Shipped to Britain</p>
<p>Washington – With the Lend-Lease Act now law, destroyers and small warships will be the first materials to be shipped across the Atlantic. Various financial and labor matters are currently under review by the authorities. At least a large portion of the funding for this act will be raised by issuing bonds of modest denominations. Legislation to prohibit strikes may not pass Congress, but a compromise is expected to establish an arbitration system for labor disputes that may arise in defense industries. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – According to those who met with the President yesterday morning, a squadron of small warships will be dispatched to Britain immediately, with their departure likely within the week. Foodstuffs such as pork, butter, and wheat will also be shipped quickly. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Reliable sources say that a considerable number of U.S. Army and Navy aircraft, including Flying Fortresses and reconnaissance bombers, will be flown to Britain immediately to demonstrate the swift implementation of the Lend-Lease Act. These aircraft will be flown by British and Canadian pilots and are ready to depart. Reliable sources also say that future shipments to Britain will include ships, machine guns, tanks, and more. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Congressional sources say the government has prepared a list of items to be supplied to Britain. The contents are unknown, but it is believed to include torpedo boats, aircraft, destroyers, and artillery. The Lend-Lease Act stipulates that the President can transfer existing Army and Navy armaments worth $1.3 billion. If this amount is exceeded, Congress must approve additional funds. Leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have presented the President with a confidential list of items that members of Congress believe should be shipped immediately, including 35 destroyers. Representative Eberharter, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told United Press reporters that he has urged the President to send the full $1.3 billion worth of war materials to Britain as soon as possible, preferably by tomorrow. "Our country must immediately transfer all available destroyers, torpedo boats, and privately-owned yachts and gasoline boats that have been requisitioned by the government. These vessels are ideally suited for escort duty against submarines." (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – The U.S. House of Representatives may vote within days on four major defense and preparedness funding bills, totaling over $9 billion. The four bills are: (1) The Fourth Supplemental National Defense Appropriation, totaling $1,533,567,100, passed by the Senate on Monday; (2) The Navy Appropriation Bill for the next fiscal year, totaling $3,546,000,000; (3) The Fifth Supplemental National Defense Appropriation, totaling $3,812,311,197, for the Army, with the majority allocated to the Air Corps; and (4) President Roosevelt's sudden submission to Congress on Monday for the construction of twelve battleships and auxiliary vessels to meet naval needs, totaling $300,814,820.

<h3>American Girl Scouts Donate Funds to Buy Rice and Distribute to Poor Residents in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – 1,200 of Chongqing's poorest families each received 13 pounds of rice today, donated by the American Girl Scouts. The Chinese Girl Scouts received $1,600 in U.S. dollars from the American Girl Scouts to purchase 16,000 pounds of rice. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Nishio Returns to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo – General Nishio Toshizo, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China, who has been in China for a year and a half, will arrive in Kobe from Shanghai on Thursday afternoon aboard the Japanese ship Kobe Maru. He is scheduled to go to Tokyo on the 17th of this month. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt to Broadcast to the Nation This Week</p>
<p>Washington – Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, made a historically valuable statement at the close of the House debate on the Senate amendments. He said, "This bill is the sound of an awakened America, encouraging all free governments to fight and win. This action by the United States proves that the cries of the weak and those who readily accept defeat, that democratic systems are powerless to cope with aggression, are false. We now demonstrate that democratic power can and will unite to implement the noble ideal proclaimed by former U.S. President Lincoln: a government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Spokespersons for both the Democratic and Republican parties expressed their hope in the House of Representatives for sincere unity and joint support of the President, and hoped that the United States could continue to maintain peace. The members of the House immediately rose and cheered the spokespersons. Representative Martin, the Republican minority leader from Massachusetts, told his party members, "Our loyalty is undivided, and we are united in heart and mind as a fearless nation, determined not to let the true spirit of America perish from the world." Representative McCormack, a Democratic Representative from Massachusetts, called on the House to abandon partisan stances and instead support President Roosevelt from the standpoint of Americans. Representative Fish, an isolationist Republican Congressman from New York who had previously opposed intervention, also announced that the Republican Party would take joint action with the Democratic Party to support the law. President Roosevelt also announced that he would broadcast to the nation this week. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>China to Receive U.S. Aid Under Lend-Lease Act; President Roosevelt Tells Reporters Everything Awaits Currie's Return</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that Dr. Currie's report would have a significant impact on U.S. aid to China. Currie had just departed from Chongqing on his way back to Washington. When asked whether China would receive aid under the Lend-Lease Act, the President replied that he assumed so. When reporters asked to explain Dr. Currie's mission to China, the President said that Dr. Currie went to observe the situation. President Roosevelt stated that the first batch of aid prepared by the Army and Navy Departments would be shipped to Britain, and Greece would also receive a small portion. He indicated that the first batch of aid would not go to China and would be decided after Dr. Currie arrived in Washington. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – There is considerable speculation regarding whether China will receive unexpected aid as a result of the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, as Dr. Currie's hurried return from Chongqing seems to coincide with the passage of the Act. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – News of continued conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists in China is currently causing concern among Americans. An editorial in the New York Times, entitled "Unfortunate News from China," stated that the most disturbing news from China in recent weeks is the continued conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists. This dispute cannot be blamed entirely on either side. Although the Communist army has fought hard against the Japanese, with democracy as its goal, friends of the Communist army, such as Edgar Snow, have also warned that the Communist army is loyal to Moscow and intends to communize China. The Chongqing government also has its own merits and flaws. However, one thing that both sides should know is that while American sympathy and aid to China are unfortunately smaller than they should be, the sympathy and aid that America provides are in the hope that China will not only be free but also democratic. Americans are unwilling to aid either side in a Chinese civil war. If China wants to use our assistance to break free from the bondage of Japan and the Axis powers, its leaders must abandon their different ideological goals and resolve their current disputes peacefully. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Gauss to Arrive in China to Assume New Post</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull believes that the exchange of ambassadors between Johnson in China and Gauss in Australia will be postponed. It has been rumored that Johnson will remain in Chongqing for at least another sixty days, as these sixty days may be the most likely period for Hitler to attack Britain or create a crisis in the Far East. It is now reported that Gauss will still go to Chongqing to assume his new post as originally scheduled. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Manufactures Amphibious Tanks for Soldiers to Land</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Defense Air Force has 200 tanks, each capable of carrying 36 fully-equipped soldiers. Their main purpose is for soldiers to land. It is said that these vehicles can travel at 23 miles per hour on land and 10 miles per hour in water and coastal waves. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Has Requisitioned Large Number of Ships; To Be Converted into Transports</h3>
<p>New York – Shipping circles here said yesterday that the United States must build,改造, or purchase a large transport fleet capable of simultaneously carrying 250,000 soldiers to any location within or outside the Western Hemisphere in times of national emergency. Although the government has not indicated that it is considering this step, it has taken considerable action to requisition ships. The government has requisitioned several high-speed passenger and cargo ships, some of which have been requisitioned from busy shipping lines. Old transport ships such as the Agamemnon, the Washington, and the World War are being repaired. The total number of ships requisitioned by the government is no less than 400,000 tons, of which 270,000 tons are passenger ships, including yachts, ocean liners, supply ships, and other auxiliary ships. The Navy Department has acquired 27 new cargo ships equipped with new equipment from the Maritime Commission through purchase or requisition, with decks capable of accommodating aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery. The government can also requisition 1.1 million tons of ships in American waters for reserve use. The United States can currently transport 250,000 soldiers while still having 500,000 tons of ships in reserve. Every new passenger ship is now equipped with the equipment to install artillery and can be converted into a transport ship, aircraft carrier, or armored cruiser in a short period of time. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Suggests Drafting Economic Constitution</h3>
<p>Washington – Senator O'Mahoney, a Democrat, suggested to the Senate today that Congress convene a meeting similar to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 to draft a national economic constitution. O'Mahoney is the Chairman of the Federal Patent Committee, which has studied the problem of the concentration of American wealth and power for the past 33 months. He read a document containing the above suggestion at the committee's final public meeting today, stating that the United States needs a national economic constitution to eliminate the economic instability that endangers the present political system.

<h3>An Analysis of the So-Called Nazi Spring Offensive</h3>
<p>As the spring season warms, it is now clearly a suitable time for aggressive nations to launch large-scale offensives. The general public has a sense of apprehension and anticipation of this, and even U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated the day before yesterday that the world is closer to the horror of war than it was ninety days ago. The two major opposing fronts of international alliances and democracies have recently been busy deploying and competing to take the lead. The most prominent of these is the U.S. Lend-Lease Act, which has just been passed and put into effect, and the British have also assembled a strong army and are waiting in strict formation. In Germany, in addition to continuing to exert pressure on the Balkans, the submarine offensive is reportedly being intensified. In Japan, after forcing French Indochina to submit to Thailand, Matsuoka and his entourage immediately departed for Germany, making an unprecedented overseas visit in thirty-five years. These facts undoubtedly cast a shadow over people's heavy hearts. In the face of such a world situation, there is no point in blindly fearing and deceiving oneself, avoiding mentioning the seriousness of the impending crisis. However, under rational observation, it is deeply felt that although aggressive nations still have an imposing momentum and are intimidating, they cannot completely hide their declining trend. In reality, although they have a determination to succeed, they do not have a sure chance of winning. Although it is also spring now, no one dares to believe that the Nazi army will repeat the miracle of last spring and summer.</p>
<p>The term "spring offensive" has taken root in people's minds because of the experience of last year and the repeated pronouncements by the Nazi authorities, to the extent that some even harbor the idea that this is the final decisive battle. In terms of the Nazi's recent situation and circumstances, they naturally cannot sit idly by as the strength of democratic countries increases and their own prestige declines. Furthermore, their past preparations and measures have not been intended for long-term warfare. Therefore, it is believable that the so-called future offensive is not just empty talk, and the only question is where and how this offensive will be launched. For the Nazis, their biggest goal is naturally to defeat Britain, but the difficulty of crossing the English Channel seems to be the biggest worry of the Nazi authorities to this day. The air offensive touted last fall has become a source of ridicule for democratic countries. If they cannot seize air supremacy over the British Isles from the Royal Air Force, the grand claims of launching tens of thousands of aircraft to flatten the British Isles will remain mere fantasies. Moreover, as for the recently touted submarine offensive, although it is a serious threat to Britain's acquisition of food resources from overseas, it is not effective for the German side to use it for a long time and cannot trap Britain. Moreover, as long as Britain continues to control the sea lanes, it is difficult to imagine that the collapse of the British Empire can be brought about solely by submarine attacks. As for the claim that the German army will use the Balkans to spy on the Middle East, great reservations must be made. Because that would create more enemies and divide strength, which is not in the interest of Germany, which is extremely wary of fighting on two fronts. Their recent efforts to operate in the Balkans, if that is not a feint, are probably mainly to appease the rear and strengthen their own economic strength. Of course, forcing Greece to cease hostilities may also be one of the German side's goals, but it should not be overlooked that Hitler's development towards the Danube region actually predates the Italo-Greek War. The launch of their future offensive cannot be separated from the above points, but no matter which strategy they adopt or whether they advance on multiple fronts, there is no absolute certainty of victory. In the past half year, the main targets that the Nazi side has dealt with are France, Spain, and the Balkans. They have still failed to make an effective strike against the British Isles. This weakness has been acknowledged even by the Soviet military recently. In such a long-term stalemate, the morale of the German military and people is as likely to gradually relax from tension as it was in Britain and France a year ago, which is also a noteworthy issue.</p>
<p>Germany's success in managing continental Europe cannot offset its failures outside of Europe. Recently, the United States' expansion of national defense and implementation of the Lend-Lease Act should be considered consequences brought about by Germany's own foreign operations. Even in Europe, their attempts with France and Spain have not been successful to this day. Relations between the Soviet Union and Germany have recently undergone subtle changes due to Bulgaria's attachment to Germany.置身in such a complex situation, its countless problems cannot be solved merely by relying on the so-called spring offensive. Matsuoka's trip to Europe may be pinned on another major hope of the Nazis. Japan's situation is similar to Germany's in that they both need to quickly plan a success. However, today's democratic countries have long been on high alert in this regard, preparing to cope with any possible event, which is hardly a favorable way out for aggressive nations!</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization; Chairman Chiang Urges the National Public to Strive to Make the Entire Country a Single, Integrated Combat Unit; Should Absolutely Obey Orders and Unconditionally Abide by Discipline; This Year is the Decisive Year, Still Requires Diligence and Self-Encouragement of Spirit</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chairman Chiang Kai-shek addressed the national public and overseas Chinese via radio tonight, saying that this year is the decisive year and that we should work even harder to make the entire country a single, integrated combat unit. The Chairman delivered an 18-minute speech on the 16th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death and the 1st anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization, starting by praising the morale of the people in the occupied areas, overseas Chinese, and front-line soldiers. He then said that the Three Principles of the People are our ultimate goal, and that we should have a common belief in implementing the Three Principles of the People, national construction movements, and making the entire country a single, indivisible combat unit. We should lead a collective wartime life. All aspects of society and all departments of the government should absolutely obey orders and unconditionally abide by discipline. The Chairman also called on the public to remember the spirit of science, which is necessary for building scientific national defense and implementing Sun Yat-sen's industrial plans. We should improve our technical skills in this war. The survival of the nation depends on national defense, and national defense depends on science. The Chairman also advocated making music and physical education universal to modernize the lives of our entire nation. Finally, the Chairman stated that the purpose of our struggle is to build a free and independent China. In this decisive year, we especially need a spirit of diligence and self-encouragement. All places in Chongqing raised flags today to commemorate Sun Yat-sen's death and the second anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization.

<h3>Declaration of the National Political Council</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Secondly, the lessons of the recent European war further prove that our self-defense war policy is absolutely correct. However, the degree and standard of past efforts are still insufficient to meet the needs of the times. On the opening day of this meeting, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, commander of our entire army, delivered a sincere speech, hoping that the people would have new understandings and new awakenings, and that they would study and discuss together and deeply express their sympathy. Over the past year, no fewer than ten countries in Europe have been defeated, lost their independence without a fight. The way to survive or perish can be summed up in one sentence: those who can fight will survive, those who cannot will perish; those who win will survive, those who lose will perish. But as civilized countries, why is there a difference between being able to fight and not? Only those with unified war will and substantial war preparations can fight and win. Otherwise, they cannot fight, and if they fight, they will be defeated and perish. Modern Europe is the center of international political activities, and now it is exhausting its intelligence, manufacturing, and all organizational forces to focus on war. The world has evolved to this point, and tracing its roots, it is greatly related to the missteps of appeasement policies by major European and American powers in the past. But now that the fire has spread uncontrollably, who can know where it will reach? Our country, in the midst of arduous war, deeply accepts the lessons of the world's reality, and sincerely hopes that the people will awaken together. The world is changing rapidly, and endless thoughts are emerging. Now, we must temper our war will, never slacken, and first build up our military and be absolutely self-reliant. Looking at some European countries, unaware of preparations, content with the status quo, once they face war, they collapse within days. We have seen this lesson and should strive to become a unified and solid combat body, sweeping away all consciousness, theories, thoughts, and behaviors that are not suitable for national defense, taking the needs of national defense as the standard for everything. All our people must be aware that today is a crucial moment for the Chinese people to strive for the freedom and happiness of future generations. Only by enhancing combat power and building a secure national defense can we establish an independent country permanently, and it is also the ultimate path to achieving final victory in the war. The resolutions passed at this conference are all based on the above two understandings as principles. The content is vast and cannot be fully listed. However, we will briefly describe the specific key points in order to encourage joint belief and action. First, regarding politics, it is advocated that all citizens unite more sincerely, support the National Government and its policies for resisting Japan and national reconstruction, and that all policies should still adhere to the program for resisting Japan and national reconstruction as a guideline. The 30th-year government's important domestic and foreign policies and other important proposals resolved this time are all expected to be effectively implemented. The members of this council trust that the government has the sincerity to implement constitutional government and are willing to cooperate in promoting it. At the same time, they recognize that from now on, they must consistently abandon the old concepts of party affiliation and replace them with the new concept of a national fighting body. The Three Principles of the People, especially the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, should be centered on the concept of national defense and made to come true. Based on this understanding, the council members hope that the Chinese Communist Party members will practice the statement of September 1937, support unity and solidarity, be loyal to the country, and not change their minds. At the same time, they hope that the government will pay attention to the efficiency and results of all government affairs, make good use of the governing power entrusted by all the people, make all policies effective, and protect civil rights so that everyone can get what they deserve. Second, regarding military affairs, based on the results of four years of war, it is proven that the absolute unity of military orders and military administration is the basic condition for winning victory. Now that the war is still at a critical juncture, and due to the needs of the world situation, it is even more urgent to build a permanent national defense. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will make more efforts to rectify military discipline and not let it be abandoned. This is truly related to the rise and fall of the country and the nation and must be solemnly stated. As for general military construction, the council members trust that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will carry it out with all his strength, and they hope that the whole country will support it. Second, regarding the economy, since the second year of the war, the economy in the rear has gradually been affected by the war. Therefore, this conference has specially discussed the general issues of materials, prices, and food, and there are separate resolutions. They all recognize that our country's wartime economy is essentially different from that of European belligerents. For example, the most important food for people's livelihood should not be in short supply, and even other daily necessities can be self-sufficient if frugality is practiced. Therefore, although price changes are a natural phenomenon during wartime, good management is one of the reasons. Therefore, the people of the country hope that the government will properly use the policy of economic control, and strive for practical and effective methods for adjusting finance, improving transportation, guiding production and sales markets, and unifying control agencies. They should also strictly enforce laws and regulations to ensure thoroughness, and especially hope that the government will guide the people to practice frugality in materials, increase the production of industrial goods, and that the general public must cultivate hardship and absolutely implement wartime life. Fourth, regarding diplomacy, since the Japanese advocated the "Greater East Asia New Order," its harm to international credibility has also increased. After listening to the government's report, the council members admire the concern of friendly countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for China, and agree with the government's policy of intensifying contacts with major friendly countries at any time to achieve the effect of mutual assistance and cooperation. The above points are briefly listed with their original intentions, stated plainly, and based on the necessity of their implementation. Finally, the members would like to solemnly declare to all compatriots that China's war is a historical destiny and has the conditions for certain victory. The most important thing is the national war will, which has proven its effect over the past four years. However, lost territories have not been recovered, Japanese troops are still in the country, and the enemy has not been eliminated. Moreover, in the face of the world's extraordinary changes, China's responsibility for resisting Japan and national reconstruction is increased. If our people can firmly solidify their war will and then strive to build up war preparations, victory can be assured. Conversely, if determination is not unwavering, crises will immediately follow. Therefore, today we are truly standing at a crossroads of rise and fall, and the importance of the opportunity is unprecedented in history. The members of this council are of shallow intelligence and cannot contribute much, but they offer their utmost sincerity and do their best to follow the compatriots from all walks of life in the country to thoroughly implement the above-mentioned objectives. This declaration is hereby made. (Eleventh day dispatch)</p>
<h3>Review Opinions on Various Government Reports</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) (4) Finance: The government's financial report expresses optimism about the financial future. Finance is the center of all government affairs, and the implementation or abolition of general government affairs often depends on the quality of finance. (Moreover, as the war gets closer to the stage of victory, the difficulties in all aspects will increase). Planning must be comprehensive and discussion must be refined and thorough. In terms of revenue and expenditure, there has been progress in rectifying the salt tax in recent years. It is hoped that attention will be paid to the distribution of people's needs. In terms of direct taxes, revenue has increased in recent years, and management has been strengthened, which is a major improvement. However, improvements should be sought in the scope of taxation, the level of tax rates, and the methods of implementation. Public debt revenue should achieve the purpose of enriching the national treasury on the one hand and reducing idle funds among the people on the other. Effective methods should be adopted to solicit public debt, and it should be allocated to those who have profited from the war to encourage them to subscribe and absorb large amounts of floating capital. The monthly allocation is generally appropriate, but the allocation to the industrial construction sector seems to be too small in proportion and should be paid attention to. In terms of controlling finance, the steps and procedures for completing the national financial network, popularization, improvement of the attitude of rural bank employees, and the mutual coordination of financial goals and bank goals are all matters that must be paid attention to, studied, and improved in relation to completing the national financial network. Among them, the attitude of bank employees and the simplification of deposit procedures are very helpful in absorbing social floating capital. All these should be reformed in order to achieve the goal of establishing a financial network to support the economy with financial power. The excessive interest rates of general commercial banks have a significant impact on legitimate production and the prospects of the market and commodity prices. The authorities should strictly crack down on this to achieve harmony between finance and the economy. The special permission for local banks to issue banknotes harms the country's wartime and post-war plans in terms of finance. In the future, it should be strictly restricted or gradually terminated.</p>
<p>(5) Economy: The government has been able to make efforts to plan, promote, and implement the encouragement and assistance to industry in the rear, material control and improvement, and waterway transportation and irrigation projects, and has achieved considerable success. However, (1) in encouraging and assisting industry, attention is paid to the machinery industry and electricity supply, with the intention of promoting the establishment of various light industries so that the people can engage in industrial production. The intention is very appropriate, but due to insufficient capital, insufficient allocation of technical personnel, transportation difficulties, and rising labor costs, it is difficult to achieve full development. It is hoped that the government will raise funds widely and provide assistance to the best of its ability, especially for the manufacturing of daily necessities, which should be effectively assisted in its development to meet the needs of society. Guidance and adjustments should also be made to the allocation of business for each factory. (2) The government's regulations on material control can be agreed to in principle. However, the control methods should be flexible so that local authorities have room to consider local conditions and make slight changes, and there should be a choice of priorities in the steps and scope of control. In terms of institutions, the central control agencies should have a centralized psychology in order to increase production and adjust consumption. In terms of personnel, lower-level personnel who implement controls sometimes make inappropriate decisions, which inevitably lead to criticism. It is hoped that the government will earnestly improve this. (3) Post-war economic plans should take into account both national defense and people's livelihood and strive to develop industry and mining. The government should pay special attention to the cultivation of technical talent for this purpose, and organize large-scale technical inspection teams to collect important data on various projects for design reference.</p>
<p>(6) Transportation: In the past difficult environment, the transportation authorities have carefully improved transportation, such as rushing to repair railways, rushing to build highways, adding water transportation, developing aviation, promoting telecommunications, maintaining postal services, and establishing post transportation. Their work is quite remarkable. However, in reviewing the effectiveness of the work, there are still many areas that should be promoted and reformed. Since the war of resistance, the lack of transportation tools, the lack of control and communication, and the difficulty of transportation administration have been overwhelming, and the supply and prices of essential supplies have been affected as a result. The transportation authorities should, in the future, under the principle of military first, also seek to improve passenger and freight transportation. Given the difficulty of obtaining supplies of automobiles and gasoline, special attention should be paid to improving transportation efficiency, reducing vehicle damage, and limiting the use of oil. The following matters should also be carried out at present: determining routes, planning to increase transportation volume, unifying transportation management agencies, reorganizing the Sichuan-Yunnan-East Road, strengthening post transportation, and preparing for post-war transportation construction. It is hoped that these items will be actively planned and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Agriculture and Forestry: The government has generally carried out agricultural and forestry facilities in the past year, such as agriculture, rural areas, economy, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, and reclamation. Recognizing the importance of agriculture and forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was specially established last year to take charge of these matters, which shows the government's emphasis on agriculture and forestry and its determination to manage them. However, because the matter is just beginning and deployment takes time, the facilities are still only models. The following points should be noted in the future: (1) The formulation of agricultural and forestry business plans should be long-term, either five or ten years, so that they can be advanced step by step and achieve success. (2) The allocation of funds for forestry should be based on the nature of the project, its importance, and urgency, and should be carried out selectively. (3) Agricultural and forestry businesses must be closely coordinated with agricultural and forestry finance, farmland irrigation, and agricultural organizations (such as cooperatives and farmers' associations) to make the best use of them. (4) The agricultural and forestry administrative and technical agencies in each province are the agencies that provide practical guidance and promotion. The central agricultural and forestry administrative agencies should provide practical assistance, train more talent, distribute them to the provinces, and raise funds to subsidize the provinces' business expenses so that they can communicate up and down and achieve the effect of directing the arms. (5) Promoting afforestation should be carried out earnestly to eliminate the past practice of merely paying lip service. (6) In recent years, prices have risen, and the value of agricultural products and livestock has also risen. The government should pay close attention to the prevention of livestock epidemics and the implementation of agricultural insurance. (7) In promoting the improvement of varieties, attention should be paid to the suitability of the soil and the proper allocation of resources so that farmers are happy to adopt them.</p>
<p>(8) Education: Overall, the education report shows that education facilities are still in line with national policy, such as the relief and placement of faculty and students, the relocation of schools in the war zone, the increase in the number of students in science and engineering departments, and the promotion of national education, all of which are intended to preserve the vitality of the country and revitalize the livelihood of the people, which is gratifying. However, the implementation of various measures should be carefully planned, such as (1) the measures for maintaining normal education in the war zone should have greater flexibility so that the progress of students' studies can be maintained while promoting national consciousness. (2) Various public colleges and universities should be adjusted and strengthened, and the various departments should be developed evenly. Assistance to private schools should be increased. (3) The establishment of normal colleges is quite in line with actual needs, but the number of teachers needed by secondary schools throughout the country each year should be estimated as the basis for establishing schools, and attention should be paid to the enrichment of their content. (4) University faculty should be cultivated domestically, but the dispatch of students studying abroad to obtain faculty in a short period of time is also unavoidable. Consideration should be given to the needs of each department and dispatched evenly. The research institutes attached to each university should also strive to enrich themselves. The educational and cultural undertakings run by various Boxer Indemnity agencies should be adjusted to make a reasonable and systematic allocation. (5) There are many national middle schools and Sun Yat-sen middle schools that have excellent results, and there are also some that have not reached perfection. However, because these schools are under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, it is hoped that they will strive for perfection and set an example. (6) The 29th year of the Republic of China has already established reward measures for vocational school education and advanced studies. There are also more ways to promote this purpose, and another reward method should be established and ordered to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities to pay attention to it. In addition, special attention should be paid to the second department of the National Normal College. (7) National education is related to the lifeblood of the country. It has recently been heard that some national schools in various places are nominal, especially in remote areas. It is hoped that the education administrative authorities will send personnel to inspect and pay special attention to this. Funds for national education must also be raised accurately from the outset so that national education can be popularized as scheduled, and the treatment of teachers should be improved. (8) The compilation of university textbooks is indeed an important plan. However, the strengths of each professor are different, and the use of the same textbook may hinder the progress of scholarship. Please pay attention to this. The compilation of textbooks for primary and secondary schools can cultivate common ideas and standardize students' levels. However, in addition to unified teaching materials, attention should be paid to supplementary teaching materials for local culture to adapt to local conditions. (9) Society: The Ministry of Social Affairs has not been reorganized for long, and all work is just beginning. Therefore, the content of the report mostly belongs to the work plan and the planning section. Its planning is comprehensive and is all aimed at the needs of wartime. However, (1) Regarding social administrative institutions, social affairs offices in various provinces should be established as soon as possible, and social affairs sections in various counties should also be added as scheduled in accordance with the new county system implementation plan of each province to exercise exclusive power. (2) The existing people's organizations should be registered as soon as possible and adjusted to make them sound. As for the people's organizations at all levels below the county level, they should be completed in conjunction with the implementation of the new county system to assist in the promotion of government orders. (3) Various social movements, such as the New Life Movement, the National Economic Construction Movement, and the frugal savings movement, should be more closely linked to each other in terms of management and supervision to achieve a higher degree of development in their work. (4) Welfare undertakings for farmers and workers should be expanded and enriched as much as possible to directly improve the lives of farmers and workers, which will also indirectly increase the quality and quantity of production. (5) The number of cooperative organizations has increased rapidly, and more attention should be paid to the quality and details. In particular, the systems of cooperative loan agencies are not without differences and should be adjusted to unify supervision and management and to develop the undertakings rationally.

<h3>Britain Receives US Aid, Air Force Power to Grow Stronger, German and Italian Losses Against Britain in Ten Months, First-Line Aircraft More Than Half Destroyed</h3>
<p>London - When Air Minister Sinclair presented the air force budget in the House of Commons yesterday, he reported on the revolutionary progress of the British Air Force's fighters and bombers, whose designs are becoming newer and whose power is becoming stronger. He said that new fighters, Spitfires and Hurricanes, equipped with more powerful engines and heavier machine guns, have now joined the ranks. The newly built Typhoon aircraft will be equipped with engines that are twice as powerful as the fighters previously used in Britain, and can carry heavier weapons and reach speeds of more than 400 miles per hour. As for bombers, they have also made great progress and are very different from before. They are twice as large and also fast, and carry twice as many bombs as before. In the past ten months, the British Air Force has destroyed 1,250 German aircraft and 1,100 Italian aircraft on two fronts, while the British aircraft's losses in combat are less than 1,800. British bombers have attacked enemy airfields and seaplane bases a total of 280 times, enemy shipyards and ships a total of 300 times, railways and transportation routes 440 times, and industrial targets 630 times. These are all in Germany, not to mention the targets that have been attacked in occupied territories. At the same time, Coastal Command aircraft have flown a total of 16 million miles. Squadrons from Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, etc., and squadrons of pilots from India, Newfoundland, and other colonies have all participated in air combat. There is also a squadron whose details will soon be known to the House of Commons, the Eagle Squadron, flown by American pilots. There is currently an aircraft assault command whose strength is 50% greater than the entire British Air Force at the time. The other two commands also have a strength equal to more than half of the entire Air Force at the time. This expansion will accelerate even more next year. The success of the British Empire Flying Training Scheme has now exceeded expectations. The output of Canadian pilots is higher than expected. The flying training in Australia and New Zealand has also been greatly expanded, and the pilots trained in South Africa are also making outstanding achievements today. Governments such as Malaya and Bermuda have long since voluntarily provided preliminary flying training. India has an organization to train pilots to serve in the British Air Force. Burma opened youth flying training classes five weeks ago and has recruited 130,000 young people to form more than 1,000 teams. There are only 750,000 young people in Burma between the ages of 16 and 18, but 130,000 have applied. This is a great achievement. The British Air Force is now entering the early stages of its greatest expansion. Over the next twelve months, Britain will rapidly absorb the majority of aircraft manufactured by Britain and the United States. Goebbels claims that US aid to Britain will be too late, but what he can now tell the House of Commons is that the best products of US design and technology will arrive in Britain in time. Although enemy night air raids on Britain may become more intense in the future, Britain's methods of defense and counterattack are gradually improving and will certainly inflict great damage on enemy aircraft, as they have already done. Although the British Air Force must fight a decisive battle with the air forces of Germany and Italy, the British have now destroyed half of Italy's first-line aircraft. More than half of the first-line aircraft that Germany had at the start of the war have now been destroyed, while the strength of the British Air Force has increased without decreasing and is now much stronger than in August of last year. Defeating Germany is certainly not easy, but it will eventually be defeated. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

Italian forces counterattacked three times, with heavy losses on both sides. Greek and Italian air forces were also deployed. (Haitong, 12th)</p>

<h3>Southern Nation's Attitude Firm, Refuses to Join Axis, But Wishes to Maintain Friendly Relations with Germany, Turkish Prime Minister Reports on Diplomacy to Parliament</h3>
<p>Belgrade, well-informed sources claimed today that Germany has once again increased pressure, forcing the Southern Nation to join the Axis. However, the Southern Nation is still insisting on signing a compromise "friendship" agreement with the Nazis. Troops from the Southern Nation are steadily deploying to the border, and military leaders are said to be firmly stating that the Southern Nation should not follow Paul's lead and lose its territorial integrity. The claim that Germany has delivered an ultimatum to the Southern Nation has been denied by the Yugoslav news agency, Avia. (International News, 12th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia, rumors about Germany sending an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government have been denied by Yugoslav figures, who strongly assert that this is foreign propaganda intended to disrupt German-Yugoslav relations. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin, the German official news agency reported from the capital of the Southern Nation that the German envoy to the Southern Nation, Heetu, met with the Southern Nation's Foreign Minister Markovich yesterday for lengthy discussions. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Capital of the Southern Nation, well-informed sources here claim that even if the Axis powers directly request the Southern Nation to sign the Tripartite Pact, the Southern Nation will not do so. There is currently no reason to believe that Germany has made a specific demand forcing the Southern Nation to sign. The claim that Germany is intensifying its pressure on the Southern government has not been confirmed. It is generally believed that the Southern Nation's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are expected to travel to Vienna within a few days, but rumors that a plane has arrived here to take them are unfounded. Official circles say that relations between the Southern Nation and Germany remain extremely harmonious. The postponement of the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's trip is due to discussing a statement of the Southern Nation's position to be issued in some form after the meeting with the German side. According to a report in this leisure political newspaper regarding the German government's comments, it is said that at this time, it is not appropriate to make any speculation about matters between the Southern Nation and Germany, and it is better to wait for the actual results. Also, according to unconfirmed reports, a German plane was shot down by Yugoslav anti-aircraft fire in the Klakduvo area last night. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>British Minister to Bulgaria Arrives in Turkish Territory, Narrowly Escapes Calamity, Large Bomb in Luggage Explodes Suddenly, 23 Dead and Injured, Investigation Underway</h3>
<p>Vichy, according to wireless telegraphs received by New York from Istanbul, British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, had just arrived, and two large bombs exploded at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul where he was staying. After police investigation, it was announced that the bombs were placed in the luggage of personnel from the British Legation in Bulgaria. In addition, a large detonator was discovered, fortunately without exploding. According to a correspondent for the "New York Times," when British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, and his entourage of sixty-seven people were registering their names in the hotel lounge, the bombs exploded, resulting in twenty-three deaths and injuries. At the time, British Minister Rendel was fortunately inside unpacking, and among the seven injured Britons were two diplomats from the British Legation in Bulgaria and two staff members from the British Embassy in Turkey. It is now believed that the bombs were hidden in the luggage of a member of the British Legation's entourage, or were placed when the luggage was inspected at the Bulgarian border. However, it has not been definitively determined whether this was the case, or whether it was the work of terrorists in Istanbul. The entire ground floor of the hotel was destroyed, and the streets were littered with broken glass and damaged boxes and furniture. All hotel staff were immediately arrested, and guests were evacuated. According to the "New York Times," the injured British personnel include: (1) the British Consul-General in Istanbul, Paton, (2) Vice-Consul Page, (3) the Reverend Bell of the British Church in Istanbul, (4) First Secretary of the British Legation in Bulgaria, Lambert, (5) Consul-General in Bulgaria, Bulman, (6) Stenographer of the British Legation in Bulgaria, Ms. Stern, and (7) British expatriate in Bulgaria, Ms. Alice. After the incident, police cordoned off the area and conducted house-to-house searches. According to another dispatch from the "New York Times," six Turkish citizens were also killed in the bombing. If these bombs were indeed placed in the luggage during inspection at the Bulgarian border, then the intention was extremely sinister, as the timing of the explosion was undoubtedly intended to make the British authorities believe that the Turkish side should be held responsible. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia, regarding the assassination attempt on British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, at a hotel in Istanbul, Turkish police surrounded the hotel where Rendel was staying last night and conducted a major search, arresting many people.

<h3>Matsuoka Departed for Germany Last Night, Military Issues to be Discussed, Washington Considers this an Unfriendly Act, Only Making US-Japan Relations Worse</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka departed for Germany at 10:35 tonight, accompanied by eleven expert followers. They traveled by special train to Yamada, and after Matsuoka visited the temple there, they will proceed to Osaka, taking a special plane to Korea, then transferring by train to Manchuria, and on March 17th, they will take the Siberian train from Manchuria. A large crowd saw Matsuoka off at Tokyo Station. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, semi-official news: Foreign Minister Matsuoka is scheduled to depart at 10:35 tonight, traveling to Germany via Siberia. It is said that as the Japanese Foreign Minister, I naturally bear a significant mission, but this trip is not for a secret mission. I have never met with Hitler, General Goering, or Ribbentrop, and I have always wished to speak with them. After I arrive in Germany, I will not only strengthen cooperation among the Axis powers, but also express my views on world peace based on the spirit of the establishment of the Japanese Empire. Matsuoka is carrying various gifts, which will be given to Hitler, Mussolini, and key figures in Germany and Italy. He will briefly visit the Ise Shrine en route to report his mission. Matsuoka also stated that he will exchange congratulations with German and Italian leaders on the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and seek opportunities to have friendly conversations with them. Matsuoka also said that after the signing of the Tripartite Pact on September 27th of last year, when he exchanged congratulatory messages with German and Italian foreign affairs officials via international wireless telephone, he made a promise to visit Berlin and Rome. Unfortunately, due to official duties, he was unable to fulfill this promise earlier, which is regrettable. Matsuoka reported on the diplomatic situation to the Privy Council this morning for two hours. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin, authoritative circles declared yesterday that what Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will discuss in Berlin will include military issues. Matsuoka is expected to arrive here within two weeks. When commenting on Tokyo's official announcement that Matsuoka will visit Berlin and Rome, authoritative circles said that his trip coincides with the passage of the US Lend-Lease Act, and its significance is particularly important. It is said that the duration of Matsuoka's stay in Berlin has not been determined, nor is it known whether Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will travel to Berlin. It is heard that Matsuoka will not visit Vichy. Authoritative circles said, "We recall that the principle of the Tripartite Alliance lies in establishing order in each country's region, not interfering in other countries' regions, not allowing other countries to interfere in our countries' regions, and preventing the prolongation of the war. We believe that the above points will be discussed after Matsuoka arrives." (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>The Real Importance Lies in Visiting the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Washington, it is generally speculated here that the ostensible purpose of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's tour of Europe is to meet with German leaders, but its real importance lies in his maneuvering in Moscow. Currently, Germany is unable to take any action to assist Japan's plans to expand in the Pacific, but the Soviet Union's activities in the Far East and its aid to China can undoubtedly constrain Japan. This is why it is necessary for the Japanese Foreign Minister to personally appear, which the new Ambassador to the Soviet Union cannot do. Since Marquis Komura's visit to the United States in 1905 to sign the Treaty of Portsmouth, no Japanese Foreign Minister has left Japanese territory. Therefore, the importance of Matsuoka's trip is evident, and Washington has not ignored the fact that Matsuoka is going to Moscow at least as a petitioner. The Washington Star stated that Germany is determined to have Japan attack England immediately, but if Japan launches an attack before England is defeated by Germany, it must risk the great danger of national extinction in the event of failure. What will the United States do in the event of a conflict between Japan and England? Will the Soviet Union not take advantage of it? These are all questions. It is believed here that Matsuoka may obtain answers to one of the above two major questions, but it is also doubtful. As for the question regarding the United States, Matsuoka cannot obtain answers in Europe. This question will always be the more important of the two questions. Matsuoka should also know that the good relations with the United States that he claims to be eager to obtain cannot be achieved by his tours of Berlin or other capitals of the Axis powers. Moreover, the sentiment here is that Matsuoka's trip is at least indirectly an unfriendly act towards the United States, which will not only not help US-Japan relations, but will also make them worse. Some commentators here have expressed doubts about the value of any agreements that Matsuoka may conclude in Europe regarding Moscow. One commentator said that even if Moscow makes a promise of non-interference, it is extremely unreliable. Because the so-called morality of this kind of imperialist country whose purpose is plunder is the morality of a group of tigers and wolves. This is its basic weakness in its interactions with each other. Since they do not trust each other and each has ambitions, it is unlikely that conflicts will not arise. Therefore, Matsuoka's meetings are nothing more than mutual suspicion and struggle, and a competition of intelligence and skill. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>French People are Angry, Accuse Japan of Deception, Details of Thai-Vietnamese Peace Agreement to Continue to be Negotiated in Japan</h3>
<p>Saigon, all French people and the press here are extremely angry at Japan for forcing Vietnam to cede land to Thailand through the Tokyo Peace Agreement signed yesterday. Their attacks on the Japanese are even more severe than on Thailand. Even French officials are launching verbal attacks and cannot restrain themselves. French officials said, "Japan has violated its promise to Vietnam and deceived Vietnam, but Vietnam has so far kept its promise to Japan. Japan promised in September to guarantee Vietnam's territorial integrity, but as a result, it incited Thailand to invade Vietnam. This decision to wage war was created by Japan, and it has supported Thailand's attack on Vietnam with a shameless and non-neutral attitude. Japan's reward for this decision and Thailand's plan to attack Vietnam can be seen, and I am afraid it will not be small. It is also said that once Japan's mediation reward is revealed, the terms of the reward will naturally show that this "victory" has brought Japan's southward advance one step closer. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the Yomiuri Shimbun predicted today that the details of the Thai-Vietnamese agreement will be completed within ten days. It is said that the agreement signed yesterday by the plenipotentiaries of Thailand, France, and Japan concerns the basic conditions for resolving the dispute, while the trivial details will continue to be negotiated in Tokyo. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the Information Bureau announced today that Thailand and Vietnam have signed an agreement promising not to form any political, economic, or military understandings or agreements with any third country that are detrimental to Japan.

The Nichinichi Shimbun commented that this agreement is the first step in stabilizing East Asia. (United Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in America Plan to Emulate the Motherland, Rumored to be Investing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Kuang Bingshun, a well-known Cantonese from San Francisco, has returned to China and has a strong intention to invest in Guangdong. This news is of great interest here. Kuang is currently in Chongqing, attending the National Political Council. It is expected that Kuang will go to Shaoguan soon, but Kuang may temporarily stay in Chongqing to attend the Eighth Plenary Session, which is scheduled to be held in late March and will discuss important domestic and foreign affairs, as well as the Communist Party's demands. Not only Chinese are paying attention to the matter of the Communist Party's demands, but also the British, Japanese, Soviets, and Americans. According to reliable sources, Kuang is also studying the economic and industrial situation in Guangdong, as overseas Chinese in North and South America all have investment relations with Guangdong. The Guangdong Provincial Government is also eager for overseas Chinese to invest in the motherland to benefit industry and aid reconstruction. 80% of overseas Chinese living in Canada and Latin America are Cantonese. They have entrusted Kuang with a large sum of money to be used appropriately in China, either as donations or investments, according to Kuang's wishes. However, China must continue to resist and rebuild, and must do its best to protect the Xijiang Delta area, as that is the hometown of overseas Chinese in America. It is heard that Kuang will request Chongqing to increase the number of troops and strengthen the defense of the Xijiang Delta. (International News Agency, 11th)</p>

<h3>European War Musings (39): On the Eve of the Spring Offensive - A Re-examination of Germany's Strength</h3>
<p>This article is a record from the New York Times, which is now translated and recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, Hitler has once again announced to the world that he is confident Germany will achieve victory in 1941. According to opinions from German official circles, he made this statement with certainty, not just making empty threats. The most important factor is the offensive power of Germany's vast war machine.</p>
<p>According to Hitler, the German army today is well-equipped and possesses immense strength, unparalleled in German military history. The battles in Poland, Scandinavia, and Western Europe have provided the German General Staff with excellent opportunities to gain valuable combat experience with relatively minor losses.</p>
<p>At the same time, the equipment Germany lost in the three short wars has been more than adequately compensated for by various military supplies obtained from the conquered countries. Taking France as an example, the equipment obtained by the German army is sufficient for over one hundred divisions. Other stockpiled valuable raw materials are not included in this calculation. In addition, German industry has been completely adjusted since the beginning of the war to meet wartime needs. It is said that British air raids have not caused significant damage to German industry.</p>
<p>The German side claims that its military strength has now reached its peak. If this statement is indeed accurate, the main question today is where the German army will launch its deadly strike. Of course, this is a military secret, but according to rumors in Berlin, German generals are confident that Britain will be defeated, and can be defeated, which naturally refers to the British Isles.</p>
<p>Previously, Berlin had repeatedly stated that a successful German invasion of the British Isles would mean the collapse of the British Empire. The fact that this is no longer being said is a noteworthy matter. Hitler's recent speech did focus on the Balkans, but it is difficult to say whether he specifically addressed this issue because of Italy's failures.</p>
<p>What Germany is most concerned about is undoubtedly the British Isles. According to Hitler, a submarine offensive will be launched against Britain in the spring, and German aircraft will also demonstrate that the air force command and aircraft industry have not been dormant during the winter. According to the Germans, if the British Isles fall and Britain continues to fight, attempting to blockade Europe with the British navy alone, or in cooperation with another country, then 40 million British people will face starvation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Germans, they have gained an overwhelming advantage for continuing the war regarding the position of the British Isles. Today is completely different from 1917. When the United States entered the war, there was still a strong France. Now this is not the case, and Britain's military bases on the continent have long been reduced. German vessels of all sizes have bases to use from Norway to Spain, and their air force can take off from coastal airfields to harass Britain's land and sea forces.</p>
<p>Hitler has assured the German people that 1941 will be a historically memorable year for the "New Order in Europe." While the US Congress is debating the "Lend-Lease Act," Washington and London have made estimates of Germany's land and air forces and issued warnings that the invasion of Britain, which has been rumored for ten months, is now approaching its most important stage.</p>
<p>A group of observers predict that Germany will attempt to invade the British Isles, and even Ireland and Iceland, in the spring. London is confident in its ability to repel the enemy, and Washington, although not as confident as Britain, is also optimistic. Only a few people believe that the German army has the upper hand. However, in any case, if Germany's invasion of Britain does materialize, its offensive will undoubtedly be of unprecedented intensity, which is a consensus.</p>
<p>The strength and weakness of the German army, the composition of its organization, and the nature of its use all seem to be uncertain speculations. A report from Washington initially stated that Germany had 70,000 aircraft, which was later reduced to 36,000. According to British estimates, the German army currently has 225 divisions. None of these reports can be said to be accurate. Only the Germans themselves know the real strength of the German army. However, a rough estimate is always possible. German military strength has undoubtedly reached its peak. If we do relative statistics, then today Germany's strength against Britain is probably even greater than its strength against Britain, France, and Poland last September.</p>
<p>From a military point of view, German strength is primarily based on its army. This is the most powerful army in the world, numbering between 3.5 million and 4.225 million, organized into 250 divisions, of which at least 200 are infantry divisions, half of which are well-trained elite troops. In addition, there are 10 to 20 armored divisions, each with 450 tanks, and 10 to 12 motorized divisions, one cavalry division, as well as mountain troops, air force marines, and several parachute divisions.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of the Flanders battle, the German army may have reorganized and re-equipped these forces. If the British and German armies fight again on land, the German army that Britain encounters, with its tanks and anti-tank guns, will certainly be more powerful than in 1940.</p>
<p>The deployment of these many troops is currently unknown. Estimates of the number of German troops entering Romania vary from 100,000 to 250,000, but it is unlikely to exceed eight or ten divisions. There may be a large army stationed in Poland along the Soviet border! There are also several divisions in the Vienna area, and there may be some German troops in Italy and Spain, especially air force ground troops. There are garrison troops stationed in Norway, and heavy troops stationed in the occupied areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. There are also troops in training in Germany itself.</p>
<p>These non-deployable troops number at most one hundred divisions, or even less. If Germany is to invade England, there will certainly be one million elite troops available.</p>
<p>The air force is Germany's second strength. There are varying views on its exact strength. But Britain does not believe Washington's estimates of 70,000 or 36,000 aircraft. In fact, simply citing numbers without explanation is meaningless. Because the air forces of all major powers, if training planes and non-combat aircraft are included, will number in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>If these types of aircraft are included, the number of German aircraft could reach around 36,000. But if its strength is measured only by actual combat aircraft, then Germany certainly does not have 36,000 aircraft. According to reliable estimates, the total number of German combat aircraft today is between 5,000 and 7,500. However, the number of reserve aircraft that have not yet participated in the war is more than double that, which can increase Germany's air force strength to 10,000 to 15,000 in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The outcome of the future battle of England may depend on the number of German aircraft, but the question of how many is still a matter of dispute. Last autumn, Germany launched an air blitz against England. Although the British Air Force had only 1,000 to 2,000 aircraft on a given day, their valiant defense ultimately led to the failure of the German offensive.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh Dowding, the commander of the British Air Force fighter command at the time, who is now in the United States on an important mission, has publicly stated that he believes that the German Air Force had been fully deployed at that time. Having already used its maximum air power, it would never be able to control the skies over England again. If this is indeed the case, then the reports regarding the number of German aircraft are clearly exaggerated.</p>
<p>However, most observers in the United States, and even some British observers, cannot help but express doubt about Sir Hugh Dowding's statement. They feel that Germany has recently been carefully conducting large-scale air force tactical experiments. Since last November, Germany has been concentrating its efforts on improving the strength of its aircraft and pilots, and creating new aircraft so that they can compete with British aircraft in terms of quality.</p>
<p>Although the strength of the German navy has increased, unless a large part of the British navy is sunk, the German fleet will never be able to overthrow British sea control.</p>
<p>Germany probably has four battleships today, namely two new 35,000-ton or 37,500-ton Bismarck-class battleships (which can be matched against the British King George V-class), and two 26,000-ton Scharnhorst-class battleships equipped with 11-inch guns. There are also two pocket battleships still in existence. One or two aircraft carriers may have been completed. In addition, there are 47 destroyers and 120 submarines, which are the most fearsome weapon.</p>
<p>Germany may be building as many as 180 to 200 submarines, with a production rate as high as six to fifteen per month. According to Hitler's hints in his speech, Germany will adopt a large-scale submarine offensive to blockade Britain. This offensive may well be a prelude to an invasion of the British Isles.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Measures to Suppress Rice Prices: Rewards for Reporting Hoarding; All Rice Stocks Must Be Sold by a Deadline; Authorities Have an Unshirkable Responsibility to Investigate Strictly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai rice market will resume business as usual today after being closed yesterday for the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation. Based on the abundance of existing stocks and the surge in supply, there is absolutely no reason for prices to rise again and again. If speculators do not cease their illegal activities, then when the recent ordinances of the two concessions to punish hoarding and profiteering are announced, some elements that harm the people's food supply will inevitably be punished. All sectors of the city believe that rising rice prices are sufficient to cause security problems, so they all hope that the authorities can punish wrongdoers based on the hoarding and profiteering laws promulgated by the National Government. The relevant laws are summarized as follows: "(1) Non-business people or merchants who do not operate in this industry who hoard designated items in large quantities, such as (rice, wheat, flour, etc.); (2) Merchants who operate in this industry who engage in profiteering; (3) Agents who introduce buying and selling without real owners of the goods, and who purchase designated items under false names; (4) Storing goods without selling them on the market, and raising prices beyond legal profits, are considered profiteering." Those who commit the above items must be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Yesterday on Nanjing Road: A Sea of People Rushed to Buy Cheap Silk and Satin, Blocking Traffic for an Hour (Zhuo)</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, several thousand men and women suddenly gathered east of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road, blocking traffic for a time. The author, passing through the area, was persuaded by curiosity and stopped to watch. It turned out that the Tianfu Silk and Satin Bureau, which had been preparing for several months, was opening. The bureau specially invited Mr. Yuan Laitun, a leader in the Shanghai business community, to unveil the opening, and movie stars Ms. Yuan Meiyun and Zhou Manhua to cut the ribbon. The bureau was founded by Zhu Weiyu and others, giants in the silk and satin industry, with substantial capital. It collected hundreds of thousands of new silks and satins from famous silk factories across the country. To commemorate the opening, regardless of cost, it sold them cheaply, gave away red eggs, and made great sacrifices, making it a sensation in all sectors of Shanghai. People flocked to buy them. The opening was originally scheduled for 9:30 AM, but as the crowd surged like a tide and the storefront glass was crushed, the police authorities dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order. The business officially began at 11:00 AM, creating such an interesting scene for the opening of a silk and satin business, which will surely set a new record for prosperous business in the future. The bureau's principle of small profits and quick turnover is predictable.</p>
<p>The People of the Entire City Can Hardly Endure It</p>
<p>To suppress the illegal acts of investors, a mere paper document cannot be effective. In recent days, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from citizens urging the exposure of the rice situation, all the inside stories, and methods for improvement. Summarizing general opinions, there are approximately the following points: (1) The rice price issue: the newspaper is not afraid to make earnest statements, but it is still of no help in difficult times. The price evaluation committee evaluates higher and higher, and the control measures have not yet been implemented, which is easy to arouse suspicion. (2) The authorities should use political power to forcefully lead (within the concession area) the banking industry to provide interest-bearing loans, in large, continuous, and uninterrupted amounts, to directly handle rice sales, and not allow them to be suspended, so as to provide long-term price stabilization. (3) The authorities should use police power to set a price limit and a deadline for the sale of rice stored in all warehouses in Shanghai, in batches according to the needs of the people's food supply. If there is any resistance, society should impose sanctions, and the hoarders and warehouse owners should be held jointly and severely punished with joint liability. We will then listen to their refusal to sell. Even if the hoarded rice is piled up like mountains, there will still be a day when they run out of rice. (4) Whether they are relatives, friends, partners, transportation workers, or employees, they should report the names and hiding places of those who hoard rice as much as possible, and submit them to the authorities, impartially and strictly investigated.</p>
<p>The Rice Management Committee Held Another Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have been in contact for days regarding concrete measures to stabilize Shanghai's food supply, and consultations with other parties have been quite busy. It is reported that initial clues have gradually been obtained, and they will be implemented as soon as the consultations are completed. It is reported that the main points are: (1) Thoroughly investigate the actual amount of rice hoarded by rice weevils and order them to release it at a reduced price; (2) Dredge the sources of rice inside and outside the city to increase the existing stock; (3) Rectify the industry regulations for rice merchants buying and selling in the rice market. Therefore, the time for the general speculative rice weevils to be dealt with by the two authorities is not far away. According to the rice industry, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession convened a meeting yesterday to discuss methods that address both the root cause and the symptoms.</p>
<p>Active Trading in Imported Rice Futures</p>
<p>Some legitimate rice merchants in the city, in order to stabilize the rice market and increase the stocks of rice in the rice warehouses, believe that few transactions are made when rice merchants determine the rice price in futures, resulting in rice stocks being unwilling to be sold, attempting to wait for the price to rise. This view is wrong. Therefore, taking advantage of the stable price of imported rice, they are actively trying to purchase imported rice in large quantities, in order to decide to ship it to Shanghai to supply the market. According to rice industry sources, more than 50,000 bags of Yangon imported rice have been telegraphed and traded on the previous two days, and the transaction price is lower than the price set by the Price Evaluation Committee in the city. The French wheel "Benahen Saint Bira" is expected to arrive here at 8:30 this morning. The ship contains more than 40,000 bags of imported rice. After the ship is unloaded, it will export again and continue to load rice to Shanghai. The French merchant ship Diya arrived in port on the 9th of this month at 8:00 AM from Saigon and Haiphong, carrying 22,500 bags of imported rice. It is now berthed at the Huacheng Wharf in Hongkou and has completed unloading the rice. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai today and return to Saigon. The French wheel Pugerville also arrived from Saigon with 7,900 tons of imported rice, totaling 78,000 bags, at 3:10 PM yesterday. The U.S. liner Illinois, managed by the Laisi Trading Company, sailed from Vancouver to Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday and berthed at buoys 14 and 15. This time, the ship carried 6,000 tons of American wheat and a large amount of rubber from the United States to Shanghai. The Saiteitia wheel, which was loaded with American wheat by Fulai Trading Company to Shanghai, has completed unloading 2,000 tons of Red Cross relief wheat after arriving in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday, and is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning via Qinhuangdao, Manila, and the South Pacific Japanese port, and return to the United States to report for duty via San Francisco. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter, the Hesheng wheel of Jardine Matheson just arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 PM on the 11th. The company decided to change the route to Yangon, Pineng, and Singapore. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai with goods this Friday. Hesheng Wheel is the first ship to sail on the Yangon route by Chahe Trading Company. The ship will also load rice on its return trip.</p>
<h3>British Royal Air Force Association Hosts Dinner for Sir Archibald Clark Kerr; Wartime Service Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai British Royal Air Force Association, in order to welcome British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and his wife to Shanghai, is scheduled to host a dinner at the Association's headquarters on the upper floor of HSBC tomorrow. At that time, in addition to a welcome speech by Mr. Pei, the host of the Association, Ambassador Clark Kerr will give a short speech, and there will be special entertainment programs to entertain the guests. In addition, the Shanghai British United Services Association, a expatriate organization that promotes wartime services, is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting at the headquarters of the Royal Air Force Association at 5:30 PM today. In addition to reporting on the work situation over the past year, the next term of officers will also be elected.</p>
<h3>Safety Training Still Has Openings</h3>
<p>The East District Safety Training Class of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has started registration on March 10 at the Third Health Sub-office in the East District. The participants are quite enthusiastic. It is learned that there are still a few openings. If there are any factory mechanics and machinists who want to join, please report to the Health Sub-office at 133 Zhoushan Road at 7:00 PM on Thursday, March 13.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Comfort and Support Movement; Shanghai Pledges 2 Million; Donors Should Remit Through the China Farmers Bank</h3>
<p>After the National Comfort and Support Association launched the Fundraising for Comfort and Support Movement, all provinces, cities, counties, and overseas Chinese responded enthusiastically. It is reported that the Shanghai City has organized a committee and sent letters to various industry associations, major companies, factories, and business houses to promote the Fundraising for Comfort and Support Movement. The target is tentatively set at 2 million national currency. Those who pledge donations can entrust the bank to remit them to the Chongqing China Farmers Bank with a remittance slip, and include them in the account.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Death of the Father of the Nation: Vigorously Implementing the Spirit of Mobilization; All Citizens of Shanghai Track and Suspend Flying, and Take the Father of the Nation as a Model; Encourage Unity to Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Construction</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 16th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation and the third anniversary of the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization, two important commemorative days. All sectors of Shanghai specially flew the flag at half-mast, took a holiday, stopped entertainment banquets, and promoted saving gold. A large number of patriotic leaflets were found in various districts. The police authorities of the Public Concession also searched major hotels. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stop Entertainment and Mourn Silently</p>
<p>The people of all sectors of the city have a special environment, so they do not hold any ceremonies for this great commemorative order. However, in order to commemorate the revolutionary achievements and fearless spirit of the Father of the Nation, all groups and the concession authorities agreed on revolutionary commemorative measures, and all flags were flown at half-mast. Customs, post offices, courts, and other agencies, as well as various groups, schools, and factories, all took a day off as usual. Envoys and consuls from all countries also took holidays in order to respect the Father of the Republic of China. Citizens from all walks of life also automatically stopped entertainment banquets and vegetarian diets to express their condolences. Also, at this time of resistance and construction, in order to express patriotism and strengthen their strength, they also promoted saving gold and saving the country and the needy.</p>
<p>Spiritual Mobilization to Unite Against Insults</p>
<p>Also, tomorrow happens to be the third year (that is, the second week of commemoration) of the announcement and implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline. All citizens of the city believe that this move by the central government is purely to encourage the people to become self-reliant, unite their strength, and achieve the purpose of winning victory and success. However, because it is the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, it is held together in accordance with the central government's regulations. Adhering to the principles of striving for freedom, seeking liberation, resisting foreign insults, and supporting the leader, eliminating bad habits, vigorously implementing a new life, working hard to unite, and striving to become stronger, to express the spirit of the great Chinese nation, concentrate efforts, promote the purpose of victory, and use the mind and power of yesterday to die and today to live, concentrate efforts, and contribute to the government to complete the mission of saving the country, striving for national freedom and liberation.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Conduct Temporary Searches</p>
<p>Since the police authorities of the two concessions began ordinary alert on the 6th, they intensified their alert work last night because it was the Revolutionary Memorial Day. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession also dispatched two red police cars and more than a hundred Chinese, Western, and Indian reserve teams, fully armed, at Yuchaqing Road, Fuzhou Road, and Guangxi Road at about 8:00 PM on the 11th to search major hotels and road vehicles and pedestrians. One side dispatched the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and a large number of detectives to patrol the roads all day long. As for the Shanghai West area, armored vehicles were also used to shuttle back and forth. The French Concession authorities also adopted the same measures. Therefore, under the strict vigilance of the authorities, this great commemorative order was able to pass safely. It is heard that the authorities' measures will be extended until the 15th. However, at that time, the necessary ordinary police alert will still be implemented.</p>
<h3>Navigation to Vladivostok is Still Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>Soviet ships sailing on the Shanghai-Vladivostok route automatically stopped sailing after the 813 Incident, and it has been more than three years since then. In the middle of last month, two Russian ships, Smolny and Komiles, came to Shanghai together for repairs. The repairs of the Smolny have been completed and it has left the dock, heading to Little Luzon to return to Vladivostok. The situation has been recorded in previous reports. According to Hongyun Navigation Bureau, 2nd Floor, 51 Guangdong Road, there are other Russian ships coming to Shanghai for repairs. Sovet arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (11th) and is berthed at the Hefeng Shipyard Pier, waiting to be docked for repairs. Another ship, Maxin Dorks, came back with Sovet. Because the machinery of the "Gorky" was damaged, it was anchored at the entrance to Changjiang at Dongsha, where the pilot boarded the ship. Sovet came to Shanghai first. The Hongyun Navigation Bureau specially hired two tugboats from the Ma'er Company to tow it. The "Gorky" also entered the port yesterday morning and berthed at the Hefeng Shipyard Pier, and will be docked for repairs within days. As for the rumor that Russian ships will resume navigation to Shanghai and Vladivostok, according to the company, the ships that come to Shanghai are all for repairs, and they have not heard anything about resuming navigation. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve in the near future, and it is impossible to predict what will happen in the future.</p>
<h3>British Giant Ship that Came to Shanghai Last Summer Was Tragically Sunk</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, many merchant ships on both sides have been sacrificed, which has been reported in the newspapers in the past. It is reported that the Mu SiamesePrlnce, weighing 8,456 tons, of the Middle East Line of the British Merchant Prince Shipping Company, was recently attacked by a German submarine in Europe and has been damaged and sunk. Only a dozen crew members were rescued. Most of the crew members have sunk to the bottom of the sea. There are a total of six ships in the Far East line of the Taizi Company, which were originally managed by Yi Tai Company. After the transfer of the shipping department of Yi Tai Company, it is now represented by Jardine Matheson. The ship arrived in Shanghai on May 10 last year and left Shanghai for the United States on the 14th to return to England, but was slightly missed and suffered this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Vehicle License Issues for Road Sections Built Beyond the Border; Municipal Council Expresses Decision Method</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters yesterday that the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" are currently negotiating the issue of vehicles built on roads beyond the border that also have a public concession and a "Municipal Government" license. However, as of yesterday, the two sides had not yet made a decision on the issue. The outcome of the negotiations cannot be announced at this time. According to this statement by the Municipal Council spokesperson, the "Special Police Director" Pan Zhijie claimed in a certain evening newspaper that vehicles traveling on roads beyond the border will soon be required to have two licenses, one from the Public Concession and one from the "Municipal Government". Merely one kind, whether it is the Public Concession or the "Municipal Government" license, is insufficient.</p>
<p>Two Covenants Discussed by Pan Da</p>
<p>The English Greater Beauty Evening Post reported that Pan Da, the "Director of the Special Police Department" in the Western District, told reporters at his residence this morning (12th) that all vehicles traveling on roads beyond the border in the Shanghai West area will soon be required to display two covenants from the Public Concession and the "Municipal" authorities. Those with only one kind, whether it is the Public Concession or the "Municipal" authority, will not be sufficient. Pan Da also mentioned the duties of the "Special Police Team" and said that he should restore the normal state of the Western District within his authority and take steps to prohibit evils in the road area outside the boundary. It is reported that Pan Da will be sworn in as "Director-General" at 57A Daxilu Road (formerly British military camp) on Friday morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese Capital Outflow - Totaling 130 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to financial circles, the Chinese capital deposited in foreign banks in Shanghai is approximately 130 million yuan in national currency. Among this, the capital owned by Chinese banks is 16 million yuan in national currency. Chinese capital deposited in Hong Kong is approximately 60 million Hong Kong dollars. Private capital deposited in the United States ranges from 20 million to 30 million US dollars. A large portion of Chinese capital after the war considers the United States as its overseas haven.</p>
<h3>Reactions in Shanghai After the Passage of the US Lend-Lease Act - The US Increases Power and Prestige in the Far East - Western Newspapers Comment That Matsuoka's Hope to Ally with the Soviet Union is Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>Regarding the US President Roosevelt signing the Lend-Lease Act, a reporter from the North China Daily Mail inquired yesterday about the reactions in this city. According to an American businessman, the US president's signing of the Lend-Lease Act to aid Britain will undoubtedly increase the power and prestige of the US in the Far East. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, American commerce in the Far East has been significantly affected. Now that the US has passed the Lend-Lease Act, it will undoubtedly stimulate American commerce and the US position in the Far East will gain greater power and prestige as a result of strengthening aid to Britain. A Japanese resident stated yesterday morning (the 12th) that the signing of the Lend-Lease Act is a very important matter. Although its importance may not be immediately apparent in the short term, it will inevitably have an impact on both the US and Germany in the long term. The Japanese side is not surprised by the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, as it was expected. At the same time, the financial circles in this city have a very weak, if any, reaction to the signing of the Lend-Lease Act. The stocks on the Shanghai Securities Market remain strong. Yesterday morning's stock prices were almost unchanged from yesterday's levels. Also, the foreign exchange market was stable yesterday morning. The US exchange rate remained at the previous day's closing price, with buying at 17.77 yuan and selling at 18.39 yuan.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Trip to Europe - Likely to be Disappointed</p>
<p>The Continental Times commented that Japan has been frequently extending an olive branch, hoping to establish a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, for nearly a year. However, Moscow has not been moved by Japan's sweet words and posturing. In fact, Japan does not truly love the Soviet Union, nor does it want to obtain any material assistance from Soviet factories. What Japan needs is to obtain a guarantee that when it extends its power to Southeast Asia and implements its southward expansion plan, no one will attack its rear. Therefore, Japan feels the need for such a treaty more urgently than ever before.</p>
<p>Starting to Implement an Ambitious Plan</p>
<p>Japanese troops are consolidating their positions in Vietnam and Thailand and will soon begin the most ambitious empire-building plan in their history. In their eyes, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and other nearby lands seem like ripe fruits ready to be picked. However, with the Soviet Union watching menacingly from behind, they are studying how to pick them. Japan's most cunning diplomats have repeatedly tried to remove this threat, but the results have all been in vain. Now, Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will have to try his luck.</p>
<p>The Purpose of this Trip is Moscow</p>
<p>Matsuoka's trip to Europe was originally intended to hold meetings with Nazi leaders in Berlin and Fascist leaders in Rome. However, the most important part of his journey appears to be a meeting with Molotov or Stalin in Moscow on his way to Germany or back home. If he can conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, it will be the greatest victory of his entire career. Matsuoka wants to obtain this long-sought treaty, which is within the realm of possibility, but we sincerely advise him not to be too optimistic.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Would Rather be Stronger than Germany and Japan</p>
<p>Matsuoka himself is a keen observer. We deeply believe that he does not harbor excessive expectations for the task of this trip. The Soviet Union is unwilling to see its western neighbor, Germany, and its eastern neighbor, Japan, become stronger again, because both Germany and Japan are its potential enemies. If the two countries were allowed to use non-aggression treaties to dominate their respective regions of Europe and Asia, where would the Soviet Union be placed? Because the Soviet Union is standing in the way, the so-called "New World Order" will never be completed. Germany's persuasion will not be very effective for Matsuoka's trip. According to recent indications, the relationship between Moscow and Berlin has lost much of its original enthusiasm. Moscow's attitude towards Bulgaria's submission to Germany is no longer a sign of German-Soviet cooperation, and the editorials in the Soviet Red Star newspaper praising Britain's military strength and strategy are not intended to please Hitler. These two things alone are enough to show that Matsuoka's attempt to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is by no means an easy task.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at the International Hotel - Successfully Resolved - Work Stoppage of Three Hours the Night Before</h3>
<p>The more than 400 employees of the International Hotel at 164 Jingan Temple Road demanded improved treatment from the management. They staged a work stoppage for three hours starting at 7:30 the night before. During that time, except for the hotel's telephones, which continued to operate, and one elevator that was temporarily opened, everything else stopped working, and the employees stood in place in an orderly manner. The hotel management, seeing this situation, invited the Public Concession Political Department to send someone to mediate. The authorities approved the request and sent Li Biju and Lu Weikang, along with a foreign national named Damemenis, to the hotel at 2:00 PM yesterday. The management representative, Mr. Lin, and the labor representatives, Song Jianchu, Sheng Youtang, Ying Ruiting, Cao Dengying, and Gu Zhouxuan, reached a resolution after mediation. The management accepted the demands raised by the labor side on the spot. The dispute has now been successfully resolved. The resolved terms are recorded as follows: (1) The original allowance for the year 1940 will be changed to a formal salary. (2) Starting from January of this year, the monthly allowance for each person will be increased according to the following: (A) 135% allowance for the lowest salary. (B) 100% allowance for the lower salary. (C) 78% allowance for the middle salary. (D) 57% allowance for the highest salary. The remaining attachments are omitted.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Youth Association Fundraiser - Goal of 150,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association is a purely social service organization. Since its establishment, it has been through 41 years, during which Chinese and foreign people have worked hard and painstakingly managed it, and it has made considerable progress every year. Membership has also grown considerably. The Association has an annual fundraising campaign. At 12:00 PM on the 11th (the day before yesterday), the Association held the opening ceremony of the 41st fundraising conference at the Yachow Road Clubhouse. Over 500 people attended, mostly well-known figures from all walks of life, gathered together, making it a grand event. During the event, Chairman Ding Guitang gave the opening speech, followed by speeches by Quan Shaowen and Liang Xiaochu, which were full of insightful remarks. All the guests were inspired. Lu Gaoyi, on behalf of the Fundraising Executive Committee, reported on the organization of the Fundraising Association. Song led the entire group in singing a fellowship song. The ceremony ended at 2:00 PM. It is heard that the scale of the Association's fundraising this year is unprecedented. The organization is divided into two major groups: the Committee and the Fundraising Team. The Committee consists of 150 people, and the Fundraising Team consists of 100 teams, totaling 1,500 people. The goal is 100,000 yuan in membership fees and 50,000 yuan in donations. Although this amount is higher than in the past, the goal per team is still 1,000 yuan, which is no different from previous years. As for the announcement dates, the first is March 14, the second is March 21, the third is March 28, and the fourth is the final announcement on April 4. The Fundraising Association will close on that day. It is also heard that the Committee and the Fundraising Team are actively promoting it. Based on the fundraising performance of the Association in previous years, it should not be difficult to achieve this year's goal.</p>
<h3>Studying Electricity Distribution - Meeting to be Convened Soon - The Municipal Council has Recruited Three Experts - Will Allocate Based on the Functionality of Various Industries</h3>
<p>According to a public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, "Regarding the issue of electricity supply, the Council has obtained the consent of Dr. Li Zhennan, Mr. Mays, and Mr. Ryonosuke Toyokawa to jointly study the allocation of electricity supply with representatives from the Shanghai Power Company." Mays is a well-known engineer in this city who has served as a technical advisor to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau for many years and has considerable influence in the city's industrial sector. Dr. Li Zhennan works for the Bank of China and is a nationally renowned statistics expert. He also has a long history in the industrial sector. After obtaining his doctorate in 1927, he served as a statistician in the Economic Research Department of the General Motors Company in Detroit, Michigan, and as the head of the Economic Research Department of the Standard Statistics Bureau in New York. According to yesterday's knowledge, the committee will convene its first meeting before the end of the week. The first step of their work will be to classify various industries into several different groups based on their function in society. Once this work is completed, the amount of electricity to be allocated to each group will be based on the supply of coal. An employee of the French Water and Electricity Company told a reporter yesterday that the issue of reducing electricity in the French Concession is currently under discussion.</p>

<h3>Daylight Saving Time - Difficult to Fully Implement - Various Parties Express Opposition with Reasons - Advancing the Clock is Not as Good as Starting Work Earlier</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese factory owners do not agree with the daylight saving time promoted by the municipal authorities starting on Sunday and will not adopt it because most factories in Shanghai are now operating 24 hours a day. Factory owners stated when they met with reporters yesterday (the 12th) that they do not like the daylight saving time method and their factories will not be affected by it.</p>
<p>Various Inconveniences of Starting Work Early</p>
<p>If factories that start work at 6:00 AM are started even earlier, workers will fear being robbed on their way to work. Most factories are located in the Western District, and workers in the Western District are often robbed on their way to the factory in the early morning, especially female workers. Furthermore, if the factory's early shift starts working one hour earlier, before dawn, it will be necessary to use electric lights, which defeats the purpose of daylight saving time to save electricity.</p>
<p>Strong Opposition is Also Justified</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs authorities declined to comment on the daylight saving time method scheduled to be implemented from midnight on Saturday. An employee of HSBC said that the bank will probably resume this method this year, but the bank has not yet made a firm decision on this. Also, an employee of the Shanghai Power Company said that the company will implement this method, which is beneficial to the entire city, starting on Sunday. When daylight saving time ended last November, reporters conducted an investigation and learned that the poor Chinese strongly opposed it because daylight saving time reduced their earning potential. People in the city's nightclubs, including the dancers, also strongly opposed it, as the change in time affected their business.</p>
<p>Listing Disadvantages and Requesting Consideration</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reader of this newspaper, Mr. Zhao Shenji, sent a letter saying, "To the esteemed editor, today's newspaper reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that daylight saving time will begin at midnight on the 15th of this month, etc. Since the implementation of this movement last year, all relevant parties have already understood its advantages and disadvantages, which need not be repeated. However, factory workers have been harmed by it. Therefore, I will briefly describe its outline as an appeal to those in charge:</p>
<p>Labor Perspective</p>
<p>Factory employees must arrive at the factory at 6:00 AM or even before 5:00 AM every day. If they are late, they will be considered absent, and their wages for the day will be affected. At a time when the cost of living is higher than ever, how can the salaried class tolerate this? Therefore, they have no choice but to force themselves to report on time. However, since the factory does not provide dormitories or transportation, they have to get up one hour before arriving at the factory. After the clock is advanced, they have to get up one hour earlier, which immediately shortens their sleep time. They have to jump out of their sleep, which results in more electricity consumption and mental anguish, let alone work efficiency. Some uninformed capitalists, confined by the stipulated working hours, disregard the actual situation and do not allow flexibility, thus depriving workers of their benefits. There are even a few capitalists who take the opportunity to forcibly extend working hours. Is this the original intention of the advocates? Factory employees work hard all day, and they must be tired and sleepy in the evening. In the summer, workers have to live together with many people in simple and small rooms because of their meager wages. They cannot fall asleep in the evening because the heat has not dissipated, and they are harassed by bedbugs all night. They can hardly sleep until midnight, and they have to get up immediately to go to the factory. As a result, they are sleep-deprived and mentally exhausted, which has a significant impact on the workers' health.</p>
<p>Advancing the Time</p>
<p>The purpose of daylight saving time is to inspire vitality, exercise the body, and improve work efficiency. Then, it is possible to start work earlier. This is not different, and there is no need to advance the clock. Advancing the clock is harmful to workers. Last year, Shanghai had two clocks at the same time, which caused various inconveniences. Your newspaper is the mouthpiece of society. May I ask you to observe the situation and urge the Municipal Council to pay attention and consider the matter of advancing the clock. The workers who are grateful will be many. Respectfully, The Shenbao Newspaper, Zhao Shenji, March 12.</p>
<h3>Yuan Chang Yarn Company Forged Warehouse Receipts - Fraud of 800,000 Yuan - Prosecution Procedures Not Completed, Trial Postponed</h3>
<p>The Yuan Chang Yarn Company, established by Jin Zhonghou at No. 6, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, previously forged warehouse receipts of Yufeng Yarn Factory and sold them to colleagues, defrauding them of approximately 800,000 yuan. After the investigation, the Central Police Station arrested four employees of the company: Wang Yating, Pan Yiru, Dong Lunkui, and Tao Yuantai. Due to the occurrence of this case, the yarn market was once in a state of chaos. After consolidation, it temporarily returned to its original state. After the police cracked the case, they found tens of thousands of yuan in large amounts that had not yet been withdrawn by Yuan Chang. However, all the bills had expired and had been stopped for payment by various money houses and banks. They requested the court to issue a stop-payment order, but a large portion of the money had been withdrawn, and only more than 100,000 yuan was seized. Yesterday, the case was questioned by Chief Judge Feng of the Special First Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan said that the plaintiff in this case reached dozens of households, so the prosecution procedures had not yet been completed, and he requested permission to postpone the retrial. Chief Judge Feng approved the order to detain the defendants and wait for the retrial to be postponed.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchant Used Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Zhang Jianshi, a grain merchant from Henan living at No. 312, Maggie Road, held a large amount of counterfeit ten-yuan China Bank notes on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month and went to the Shanghai Telephone Company on Jiangxi Road to install a residential telephone. When paying a deposit of 181 yuan, Zhang mixed 90 yuan of counterfeit money into the real money in an attempt to use it. Unexpectedly, the Western employee discovered it and reported it to the police station. Zhang was detained, and more than 50 counterfeit notes were found in Zhang's home. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special First Court for further trial. The police prosecuted him for using counterfeit currency. Judge Feng took the seat to hear the case. The defendant still claimed that he was deceived by a friend and that he did not know that it was counterfeit money. The court adjourned the trial, and the defendant was returned to detention pending review. The evidence was first stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Hiding in Inn - All Rounded Up in One Sweep</h3>
<p>The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Old Gate Police Station received a report at around 8:00 PM the night before that a large group of bandits was hiding in Room 24 of the Shanghai Hotel at No. 76 Xiangfen Lane, Zhejiang Road. They went and arrested Jin Zhiwei and Xi Jin, and confiscated a pistol and five bullets. Later, Wang Jincai, Huang Jinbiao, Wu Sungen, Wang Zhongyi, Qu Genfu, Ji Zhijie, Tang Yonglin, and Fei Lansheng arrived one after another and were arrested by the detectives who remained. They were all brought to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan said that he still needs to investigate the case and requested detention. After further questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the detention of the case and the postponement of the retrial for one week.</p>
<h3>Private Rooms in Inns - Gambling and Taking Commissions</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that people in various inns in the Concession were gambling and taking commissions for profit, the Old Gate Police Station ordered strict investigations. There have been previous cases of cracking down. Detectives Zhou Wenqing and Huang Sifu found that Room 214 of the Tianran Hotel at No. 60 Zhizhong Road was a large gambling den, and that people were also gambling in Room 317 of the Andong Hotel at No. 131 Hubei Road. They went to arrest them. Thirty-eight people including Li Zhan were arrested in the Tianran Hotel, and nineteen people including Zhou Yonggao were arrested in the Andong Hotel. Gambling equipment, dominoes, and gambling money were confiscated and brought to the police station. They are now being sent to the Special First Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted them for gambling. After hearing the case, Judge Fang gave them severe punishments respectively.</p>
<h3>Fire in Watch Shop</h3>
<p>A certain iron watch shop at No. 681, Sichuan Road, Public Concession, caught fire suddenly and fiercely at 8:10 yesterday. The fire brigade rushed to the scene after receiving the news and quickly extinguished it. It is heard that the loss was very large.</p>
<h3>Suicide Notices</h3>
<p>At 4:05 PM yesterday, a young man suddenly jumped off the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel on Jingan Temple Road and died. It was learned afterward that the deceased was named Lei Zhaoming, 26 years old, from Guangdong. He used to be a waiter at the Dadong Ballroom. He had a short sight because of gambling losses.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM yesterday, a man in his thirties jumped into the river at Pier No. 9 of the Bund because of extreme poverty and committed suicide. The street police station at No. 3195 was called to rescue him, but he was already dead.</p>
<p>Young woman Zhou Jianyuan, who lives at No. 29, Zhuan Ham, Yidingpan Road, used to be a teacher at a certain elementary school. At 8:15 yesterday morning, for some unknown reason, she suddenly swallowed a gold ring in her room in an attempt to commit suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<h3>Finance - Four-Month US Exchange Rate - Suddenly Seen to be Loose and Cheap - Already Level with Spot</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The black market situation for British and American exchange rates was the opposite of the previous day. Foreign banks were very willing to sell, and speculators came to pick up, and oil foreign companies also settled their accounts, but the trend of futures was loose and cheap. The opening price of the April US exchange rate was 5.5. There was a lack of inquiries for the first shilling, and no transactions were heard. The market became more silent before the close in the afternoon. As a result, the spot US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 1.375. There was no difference between the two exchange rates. The April exchange rate has been leveled with the spot.</p>
<p>Oil Foreign Companies Have Settlements</p>

There was no market against France. The Central Bank was on holiday, and there was no market listing. The opening selling price of spot by banks in the morning: British gold 3.375, US exchange rate 5.5 yuan. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, both exchange rates were flat. After the opening, foreign banks were very willing to supply. Although speculators bought back, the market still appeared to be hardening. It is estimated that speculators dragged the April US exchange rate to 5.5 yuan. HSBC's listing revealed that all exchange rates did not change. The silver balance tax was also flat. At the time, a certain foreign company suddenly had a kerosene settlement and settled this month's US exchange rate with a foreign bank, and the foreign bank continued to supply and sell tirelessly. The potential was still stable. The transaction price was 5.5 yuan. It was also heard that a Chinese bank in Shanghai settled the same month's US exchange rate with a Chinese speculator, also at 5.5 yuan.

<h3>The Gold Market is Advancing Slowly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot exchange black market continued to trend higher, pulling out of the 6,300 yuan pass twice, but the people's minds were stable, and the reaction was minimal, so the difference between high and low was only more than 40 yuan. The process still showed a winding and circling trend. There were no significant large buyers. Only Dafeng sold at high prices, and Defu also sold a little, but Xinfengyong and Hengji were more willing to buy, so the price was raised to 6,315 yuan. The closing result at noon was 6,300 yuan, up 30 yuan from the previous day. The half-day transaction was still strong, with a total of 10,000 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Hesheng sold ten taels to Hengji in cash, and the term price was 450 yuan higher. Shihe and Chuxiang sold 100 taels, 440 yuan higher. Decorated gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Continued to Improve by 30 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, people from all sides were calm, especially the general retail investors, who had high hopes and showed it outwardly, so the interest in buying was very strong when it opened, and it rose 10 yuan to open at 6,280 yuan. However, because Dafeng and Shunyuan had short selling positions, they were blocked, and it fell back by 10 yuan, reaching 6,270 yuan. Because Chengji, Yifeng, Gonghe, etc. saw the cheapness and wanted to buy, the market suddenly insisted again and pulled out of the 6,300 yuan pass, reaching 6,305 yuan. However, it fell as soon as it rose, because Yida, Rencheng Yongyou had sales, falling to 6,290 yuan. Finally, although foreign exchange futures were hard, spot was still flat, and Xinfengyong, Hengji, Mingfeng, etc. tended to buy, and returned to over 6,300 yuan, reaching 6,315 yuan. Before long, Fengji and Defu came to sell again, so the army retreated into 6,300 yuan before noon and reported 6,290 yuan. The closing result was 6,300 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day. Calculated at 5.5 yuan per tael of gold lost in March, it was 6,331 yuan and 8 jiao, which was 31 yuan and 8 jiao. There was no market in the afternoon. The range was only 45 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the real gold of the cash number was 450 yuan higher than the exchange (futures), and the intake was 80 yuan lower than the sale. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Has Not Changed</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael has not risen or fallen. Datonghang still listed 690 yuan, and the new Tonghang was similar to the previous price, and the intake was reduced by more than 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Slight Increase in Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw a slight upward trend. The spot price of silver bullion also edged up. British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes showed a slight softening, retreating to 45.5 yuan in the evening session. American gold notes rose as high as 18.05 yuan before settling at 18.01 yuan, a gain of seven fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a slightly firmer trend, rising to 4.45 yuan in the evening session. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were balanced, with the evening session remaining unchanged at 1.89 yuan. Demand for Korean notes was strong, reaching 1.57 yuan in the evening session.</p>
<h3>Silver Futures and Spot Prices Both Rise in India</h3>
<p>London, November 11th (via telegraph): The silver market for both near and far futures in large bars is firmer. Market conditions are stable, with no changes after closing. Demand for American silver prices is firmer. Spot silver in India rises by one anna, and futures rise by one anna. Market conditions are stable, with a total of 100 contracts traded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for drafts was 1.5 yuan discount for every 1,000 yuan, while the lending rate remained at 4.5 yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon sessions quoted at seven fen.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Leaning Towards Investment, Trading of A and D Bonds Attract Attention</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter public bond market saw considerable fluctuations yesterday. It initially rose with new bullish sentiment, then fell as long-term bullish investors exited. Many financial institutions took long positions, and the floating positions were mostly absorbed by financial institutions. Attention was focused on types A and B, but current sentiment favors types A and D as being more affordable. The trend indicates that the morning's rapid rise, with type C surging past the 70 yuan mark, triggered the exit of bullish investors from Sin孚, resulting in a slight correction. Due to the large number of investors, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic. At the opening this morning, type C started at 66.7 yuan and rose directly to 70.6 yuan, with Shun昌, Yong Da, Hou Da, and Jiu Cheng being the buyers, mostly for investment purposes. Sin孚 took the opportunity to exit, and Hong Da, Tong Kang, and Yi Ji also sold off a significant amount. The afternoon saw a small correction, but Shun Chang and Yi Xing's appetite remained strong, and Yong Da and Xie Da's appetite was also not weak. Type C rose again by three or four jiao, but then Tong Kang, Hong Da, and Xin Chang again sold off, putting slight downward pressure on the price. Finally, Xie Kang复再sold at 70 yuan, causing it to break. It can be said that those skilled at speculation were only temporarily affected by speculative elements, and it was unrelated to the overall trend of public bonds. The official upward trend is still to come. Since the passage of the American Lend-Lease Act, the practical assistance to China has become more active, boosting confidence in the bond market. As a result, besides type D, which saw a slight loss of five fen, the remaining bonds continued to rise by three or four jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 4 million yuan. A concise summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 7.8 yuan. The stock market for various brokerages is seeing increasing activity, indicating a growing number of investors. This is because speculators are not as enthusiastic as before, as seen in the gold and foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>The public industrial stock market remains extremely quiet, with no major price fluctuations. However, near the close of trading, there was a sudden surge in buying, with various well-known industrial stocks being purchased at market price. Rubber stocks were also boosted.</p>
<h3>Ye Guang Real Estate Announces Dividend</h3>

<h3>Two Companies Announce Dividends</h3>
<p>The British company Da Ying Zilai Fire Co., Ltd. plans to pay a dividend of 8% per annum for 1940, amounting to 8 jiao in national currency per old share and 4 jiao per new share.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Sales Increase Slightly, Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, "Double Horse" Breaks Through 400 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firmer with an accelerating upward trend. This is because Hong Kong interests are showing a more positive outlook on the spot yarn sales market, with 32-count single yarn being the preferred purchase. As a result, confidence is boosted, and short sellers rush to cover their positions, while new bullish investors add to their positions. Therefore, 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose above the 400 yuan mark. However, old Guangdong merchants are selling off their March "Double Horse" yarn in large quantities. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" was 1404 yuan, and the low price was 1379 yuan. In the afternoon, buyers remained active, with the initial price at 1411 yuan, then 1406 yuan, and finally 1412 yuan. It is reported that 240 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today (13th).</p>
<p>The opening price of "Double Horse" was 1379 yuan, with relatively calm market sentiment. Buyers were still present, gradually pushing the price up to between 1385 and 1386 yuan, where it remained for a long time. Subsequently, with Guangdong merchants purchasing various yarns, totaling 600 bales, buying sentiment suddenly surged. Short sellers slightly covered their positions, and the price once recovered, rising to 1404 yuan. The closing price was 1402 yuan. It is reported that the total transaction volume for half a day was 6850 bales. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Calm</h3>
<p>Spot cotton conditions are slightly higher, but transactions are very few. However, there is some purchasing activity from Chinese factories, leading to firm sentiment.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to foreign merchants buying, but then fell due to spot traders selling and taking profits. As a result, the closing price was six or seven points lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market continued the previous day's upward trend. Speculators and cotton merchants aggressively bought, leading to a sharp advance in the market. Yesterday, even the forecasts were higher than Robi's.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market still sees no large-scale buying and selling. However, with various factors being favorable and the yarn market repeatedly soaring, combined with the scarce foreign cotton inventory in this city, the cotton market will undoubtedly trend towards active and firmer conditions in the future.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Industry Insiders and Outsiders Rush to Absorb, Cloth Prices Rise Again Sharply</h3>
<p>Due to current demand, the cloth market saw development, fueled by speculative buying and short covering. Industry insiders and囤户(speculators) absorbed increasing amounts of piece goods, leading to a sharp rise in cloth prices again. White coarse cloth rose by about five jiao per piece, while fine cloth and twill rose by five jiao to seven and a half jiao. Dyed cloth rose by about one yuan. 富贵 (Fu Gui) fine cloth was sold for 43 yuan in the morning, and 富贵 (Fu Gui) twill was sold for 38 yuan, similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, prices increased by five jiao to seven and a half jiao. Over 800 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Zhejiang East, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou merchants bought over one hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth. The Fujian merchants bought fifty or sixty pieces of colored twill cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants are urgently purchasing and shipping existing goods, and are purchasing over two hundred pieces of new goods such as Hua Feng 士林, and 大新 colored twills.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to rising yarn prices, buying from both industry insiders and outsiders continued to be strong, and the upward trend was very robust. The spot market for 龙头(Long Tou) fine cloth was closed due to the holiday, but over-the-counter trading saw a sharp rise of 1.4 to 1.5 yuan per piece. Futures on the exchange closed for the current month at 48.99 yuan, April at 50.061 yuan, May at 51.49 yuan, and June at 51.99 yuan. 哔叽 (Biji) and 根子(Gen Zi) from 四君子 (Four Gentlemen) were very tight, with small transactions at 1.355 yuan per yard. Dongmian 洋行 (Dongmian Foreign Firm) had placed an order for dozens of packages of Blue Chicken fine cloth for April delivery, priced at 51 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Export: Twenty pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Xiamen today (13th), and another 500 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yellow and Green Serge are in High Demand</h3>
<p>Grass yellow and grass green serge, grass yellow and grass green 华特 (Hua Te)呢 (Ne) and 马裤呢 (Ma Ku Ne) have seen a significant increase in demand and price recently. This is due to merchants actively purchasing, and most of the goods in the hands of manufacturers are already sold out. People are intending to hoard, and the factories are facing scarce raw materials and high costs, making it difficult to keep up with production, resulting in a particularly strong demand. Currently, Dachang 羊城 (Yangcheng) brand grass yellow and grass green serge are selling for 17 yuan per yard, with most lacking spot goods. Yinfeng 财神 (Caishen)虎空 (Hukong)牌(brand) are calling out for wholesale prices of 19.5 yuan. 协新 (Xie Xin)达隆 (Dalong) grass green and grass yellow 华特 (Hua Te)呢 (Ne) are calling for 22.5 yuan. Yinfeng 黄马裤呢 (Huang Ma Ku Ne)? 30 yuan. Yih和(He) No. 19 yellow medium-thick 哔叽 (Biji)is being called for 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, due to rising goods prices, guests from Ningbo and Tianjin have come to Shanghai to purchase western-style呢 (Ne) and 大路呢 (Da Lu Ne)绒 (Rong)in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Ships Increase Freight Charges, Sugar Prices Follow Suit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in prices due to Dutch ships increasing freight charges by 20%, leading to higher costs. The quoted prices increased accordingly. Spot prices: First grade coarse white sugar was 81 yuan at the depot, and 80.8456 yuan outside the depot, up by six jiao. March 20th delivery was 81 yuan, 80.68 yuan, and 8 jiao. End of March delivery was 81.1 yuan, up by seven jiao. Dutch red sugar was 60 yuan. Taikoo granulated white B 唛 (Ma) west depot was 80.8 yuan, up by three jiao. End of March delivery for DY 唛 (Ma) was 81 yuan, and HX 喀西 (Ka Xi) was 77.7 to 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Squid and Kelp Both Rise</h3>
<p>Squid has been in short supply recently, and with Hong Kong merchants actively searching for it and limited availability, prices have risen again. Yesterday, the market price reached 250 yuan, with a very strong trend.</p>
<p>Kelp has been in short supply for a long time, and inventories are almost exhausted, so market prices have risen again. Long bundles are 40 yuan, and short bundles are 25 yuan, with a strong market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Match Prices Repeatedly Reach Highs</h3>
<p>The daily buying price of matches has reached an unprecedented high due to reduced raw material supplies, scarce factory shipments, and hoarding by speculators. Market prices are soaring. Yesterday, Meili brand was selling for 680 yuan per box, Phoenix brand for 670 yuan per box, second-grade Luo brand for 600 yuan per box, and third-grade miscellaneous brands for 540 yuan.</p>
<h3>麻袋 (Ma Dai) Soars</h3>
<p>The price of 麻袋 (Ma Dai) is soaring because the raw material for fixed orders is scarce, and there has been no price arrival from Hong Kong for a long time, leading to a gradual increase in market prices. The current market is as high as 4.7 yuan and as low as 2 yuan, with various prices listed in detail below.</p>
<h3>Metal: American Tinplate Soars</h3>
<p>American tinplate has recently seen increased demand from egg factory merchants, as well as hoarding merchants and foreign firms. There is a sense that the current circulating goods in the market are not enough to meet demand. In addition, there are no spot goods being shipped from overseas. Therefore, those in the industry with a small amount of this goods are very bullish. Standard prices have been soaring in recent days, rising by as much as thirty to forty yuan per box compared to Japanese goods. The asking price the other day, such as three hundred and thirty yuan was quoted for flower patterns weighing one hundred and eighty pounds, twenty inches by twenty eight inches, and two hundred pound boxes were selling for three hundred and sixty yuan.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: North-South 洋货 (Yang Huo)Goods Come and Go Frequently</h3>

Ninety pieces of tea leaves, eighteen boxes of woolen yarn, and eighty包(bao) of yellow silk arrived from Dalian.

<h3>After the Suspension of Unified Enrollment, the Ministry Sets Enrollment Methods for Colleges and Universities</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The unified enrollment of public colleges and universities this year has been suspended due to transportation difficulties in various places, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Ministry of Education has formulated the "Methods for Public Universities and Independent Colleges to Enroll Students Independently in the 30th Year of the Republic," instructing public colleges and universities to comply. The main points of these methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each national and provincial university and independent college should refer to the number of new students admitted in the 29th year of the Republic, formulate the enrollment quota for each college and university in the 30th year, and submit the enrollment brochure to the Ministry for approval before the end of this year's call. (2) Each college and university should conduct its own enrollment on a regular basis in accordance with the approved quota. If the number of admissions is not fixed, a first-round enrollment should be held. (3) The subjects for the entrance examination of each college and university are prescribed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) For Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Commerce (including departments of the School of Management), Education, and the Arts Group of Normal Colleges: Civics, Chinese, English, Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), History and Geography of China and Foreign Countries, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

(C) For Colleges of Medicine and Agriculture: Civics, Chinese, English (or German), Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), Physics, Chemistry, History and Geography of China and Foreign Countries, Biology, Physical Education, and Music. New students in the departments of Music should be tested in subjects in Group A, and additional tests should be given in performance skills and music knowledge. In addition to written tests, students in each college should also be given oral tests. If each college and university has a specialized training course, its entrance examination subjects shall be handled with reference to the foregoing provisions. (4) Each college and university that enrolls students with equivalent high school graduation qualifications should handle it in accordance with the following restrictions: (A) The number of students admitted with equivalent qualifications should not exceed 5% of the total number of admissions. (B) Students applying with equivalent qualifications should be limited to those who have completed two years of high school before the summer vacation of the 29th year of the Republic but were unable to complete their high school studies due to the war and have been studying at home. They must submit transcripts from their original school and be approved after review. (C) Students from senior vocational schools and normal schools, even if they have completed two years of study before the summer vacation of the 29th year, may not apply with equivalent qualifications. (5) After the announcement of enrollment, each college and university should list the grades of each applicant who has been admitted and not admitted, together with the examination questions for each subject, and submit them to the Ministry for record. (7) Each college and university that has a university preparatory class should conduct an entrance examination for the preparatory class after the announcement of the admission of new students. The examination subjects shall be determined by the school and reported to the Ministry for record. (7) Students with excellent results in the high school graduation examination of each province and city this year, students who have completed the university preparatory class of each college and university this year, and students who have been recommended and exempted from examination for further studies from each province and city in the "Liberated Areas" this year will still be distributed to each college and university by the Unified Enrollment Committee of Public Schools of the Ministry of Education in accordance with the regulations without examination. The Ministry of Education has also made appropriate regulations for the enrollment of private universities and independent colleges and public and private vocational schools in the 30th year of the Republic, with reference to the foregoing methods, and has instructed them to implement them.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Obeys Order to Establish Six-Year Secondary Schools; One or Two Schools to be Piloted in the First Semester</h3>
<p>(Lishui News) Secondary schools in Zhejiang Province have all been a three-three system. Since its implementation, it has been deeply felt that it is not easy to improve the level of education. Moreover, due to the division of senior and junior high schools into two stages, in order to allow students to take higher-level science subjects for the purposes of furthering education, it is necessary to teach an overview in advance, and then re-teach it in senior high school, resulting in a double-circle in the entire curriculum. The discontinuity of the curriculum and duplication is unavoidable, which is a waste of funds and time, and also greatly affects the effectiveness of teaching. At present, middle school students have heavy homework, but their level has not been improved. This is a major problem in secondary education. Before the war, Jiangsu Province created a five-year secondary school, but it was interrupted due to the war. This province also intends to conduct a pilot project, but is limited by funding, so even though there is a plan, it has not been realized. Recently, the Ministry of Education designated the Education Department of this province to first pilot one or two six-year secondary schools among the public and private secondary schools with excellent results in the province. The curriculum allocation and arrangement will be for a period of six years, avoiding duplication and discontinuity. Various disciplines will also be balanced and activated, so that students have considerable literacy in humanities and labor education, and are a good foundation for preparing to enter university. It is heard that the Education Department has decided to start the pilot project in the first semester of the 30th year and is currently actively preparing.</p>

<h3>I Have Rebelled!</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>I don't know how to begin writing. What can a woman who dropped out of junior high school write? But no matter what, I must express everything. Let's put aside the small talk and talk about my father first. Whenever someone asks me, "What kind of person is your father?" I will definitely answer with the word "cruel." My father grew up under the feudal system, and perhaps he is still the most vehement advocate of it. He once served as a county magistrate in a certain county, and of course, he skimmed quite a bit of money. In a wealthy environment, my mother loved me as her life. I was her only daughter, so all the material enjoyment was very satisfying to me; it's just that my stubborn father treated my mother and me very coldly. I don't know why, maybe he had another lover, we have no way of knowing. Because my mother was an old-fashioned woman who followed the "three obediences and four virtues," as long as she had food and clothing, she never asked about anything.</p>
<p>When I was fifteen years old, my only loving mother died of a stroke, and my father married a woman in her thirties, who was my insidious stepmother. Not only did she not love me, but she also hated me. In the year I turned seventeen, after graduating from junior high school, my stepmother instigated my father to prevent me from continuing my education. At that time, I didn't have the slightest courage to resist, so I had to obey. Except for my aunt—my mother's younger sister—I had practically no relatives. Lonely, I had only tears to accompany me in the evenings. Accidentally, I met a young man, and we fell in love with each other from friendship. I love him, and he loves me too. But unfortunately, things often happen to me. My stepmother found out about us. Of course, she couldn't help but tell my father, who was furious and scolded me for being shameless; and told me: "No matter what, you can't love him." I was also extremely angry and said, "I won't love anyone, only him." Therefore, the gap between father and daughter became even deeper.</p>
<p>Under my father's strict prohibition, we often met in secret. But every time we were together, we were always worried. I couldn't find happiness, and I couldn't live in this dark family anymore. I really couldn't bear it, it would force me to death. I'm still young, I want to live, so I want to jump out of this cage.</p>
<p>The fire of youth is burning, and the harsh environment is forcing me. I have rebelled, resisting the feudal system, and from now on I am unwilling to be its slave. On a bright spring afternoon, when I reached the legal age, I followed my lover and left my father. In recent years, we opened a reasonably large food store, and the business is very prosperous. Our life is also always happy. But I always have a vague fear that when my three-year-old daughter grows up and is called an "illegitimate child," how will she look down on her parents, how will she resent her parents? Because of her parents' illegal union, she received this unjust charge. But who is the real sinner after all?</p>

<h3>How to Deal with Adversity?</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Interpretation of Adversity</p>
<p>Adversity is the hardship, obstruction, failure, loss, trouble, pain, worry, and hesitation that one may encounter on the road of life. In short, everything that goes against our wishes can be included. As for thieves failing to steal and robbers failing to rob, these cannot be considered adversity because they have deviated from the true goals of life. In any case, life cannot be without adversity, especially in the current environment. So, how should we deal with adversity when it comes?</p>
<p>Reduce Desires</p>
<p>The great American philosopher William James said in his famous book "Psychology: Briefer Course": "Life's sense of satisfaction depends on the ratio between 'success' and 'desire.' Success is like the numerator, and desire is like the denominator. We can increase satisfaction by increasing the success component; but we can also achieve the same result by reducing the desire component. (Success ÷ Desire = Satisfaction)" According to this reasonable saying: the success or failure of things often depends on the opportunity, and is subject to the environment. We humans cannot say we have absolute certainty. However, we can directly control and reduce our own desires. So, we should not have illusions, we should not hope for the impossible, and we should cling tightly to reality. We must also remember: on the road of life, "failure is the norm, and success is the exception." We should anticipate and predict the possibilities of various failures beforehand: this can avoid excessive disappointment.</p>
<p>Stay Calm and Patient</p>
<p>Adversity cannot always be foreseen. Sometimes it comes suddenly and unexpectedly, as the saying goes, "Sitting at home, disaster comes from the sky." So, we must remain calm and patient when things happen. Because panic only increases the seriousness of the situation; impatience only makes the pain more acute, without benefiting the facts. Calmness can help us find a way out of a dead end, and deal with crises. Patience can help us turn great pain into small pain, and safely overcome difficulties! However, this requires a lot of practice and cultivation.</p>
<p>Make Up for Deficiencies and Correct Mistakes</p>
<p>If adversity is caused by our own mistakes, then we should not blame heaven or others. On the contrary, this is an excellent opportunity for us to reflect on ourselves and make up for our deficiencies: we must accept the good lessons of the facts at any time and any place! We must repeatedly think about our own mistakes and shortcomings, in order to criticize ourselves severely, change our ways, and complete our great life task with new efforts!</p>
<p>Moral Character</p>
<p>The reduction of desires that I speak of is not to encourage people to live a life of ease and contentment, without any ambition to improve; the policy of calmness and patience that I speak of is not to encourage people to submit and be humble, living the life of a slave! On the contrary, the first point is only to tell people not to have unrealistic fantasies; the second point, patience has a certain limit. This limit cannot be crossed. The boundary of patience should be sought in moral laws, in our sacred and inviolable personality. Everything we do should be based on the welfare of society and the community.</p>

<p>(5) The Distinction Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>"Then why did you learn to act in the first place?"</p>
<p>"To eat, and it was my mother's idea." He clasped his hands together, constantly rubbing them.</p>
<p>Today, not only did Zhao Si not come, but even that Mr. Ji, the bodyguard, also sat waiting in the gatehouse, hoping to ask Qiu Haitang about the reward Zhao Si had promised yesterday, so only a young hostess and her guest were left in the reception room.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang himself felt very strange, his speech was several times more fluent than usual, and he spoke a lot. Over the years, the knowledge he had gained from books and newspapers, and the education Yuan Shaowen had given him, combined with his extraordinary understanding, actually helped him to have a fifty-minute conversation with Luo Xiangqi, a student from the provincial women's normal school, on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Although the people talking did not feel it was long, there was another person who had been waiting anxiously!</p>
<p>"What's taking so long?" Ji Zhaoxiong frowned, looking at the gatekeeper, Old Zhang, in surprise.</p>
<p>"Maybe the Third Mistress is writing a letter for Mr. Wu!" Old Zhang speculated kindly.</p>
<p>Xiangqi's usual behavior had a strong hold on Ji Zhaoxiong's thoughts. No matter how sinister he was, he couldn't immediately think of anything else.</p>
<p>He put a hand in his left pocket, fidgeting with a five-dollar bill he had borrowed from another bodyguard today. Countless thoughts began to impinge on his nerves.</p>
<p>"My gambling luck hasn't been good these past few days. I don't know if I can make up for my losses tonight!" Although this guy had good schemes, he couldn't escape the circle of mahjong tiles. No matter how good he was at making money, he was always poor.</p>
<p>According to his estimate, if the Third Mistress was really willing to arrange this little matter for Qiu Haitang, then he could at least borrow fifty or a hundred from Qiu Haitang today; even if it was just writing a letter, he probably wouldn't be afraid of Qiu Haitang not coming up with twenty dollars, right?</p>
<p>"Old Zhang should share some money with him...?" (53)</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Unsung Heroes</h3>
<p>— Xiong</p>
<p>Most of the so-called heroes in history are ruthless murderers, but their names are often mentioned and regarded as objects of respect and praise. But those who have made great contributions to the community, their names have long been forgotten, forgotten like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>People often mention Napoleon and Genghis Khan, praising their military achievements and worshiping them as heroes. Is it because they saved the lives of so many people? Or is it because they improved the lives of mankind? Neither. They have not made any remarkable contributions to the community; only because they launched cruel wars, driving countless innocent people to shed blood and sacrifice their lives on the battlefield, and they themselves thus gained the position of master of all people, so they became famous, became heroes, and received people's respect and praise.</p>
<p>Since Jenner invented the method of vaccination to prevent smallpox, I don't know how many children's lives have been saved; since Pasteur discovered that infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, and thus created methods of prevention and treatment, countless people have avoided the fate of death. Their contributions to the community cannot be said to be insignificant. But their names are not as famous as those murdering demons. How many people remember their names today?</p>
<p>No one dislikes fame. Everyone wants to establish some career in the world in order to be remembered by future generations. So, clever people scramble to learn from those murderous demons—the so-called heroes, hoping that their names will be mentioned by future generations as objects of respect and praise, just like those heroes. Only fools are left to follow those benefactors of mankind, to benefit the community.</p>
<p>However, after those heroes die, what they leave in the world is just a pitifully empty name! But those fools leave behind real and indelible achievements; their grace benefits the community, forever. They are unsung heroes, they are true heroes!</p>

<h3>The Light of Night</h3>
<p>— Shan Li</p>
<p>Who doesn't love light, but the light in the night is even more lovely!</p>
<p>I love light, and I believe everyone loves light, because light can illuminate our eyes, allowing us to see the snakes and rats hiding in the darkness, allowing us to recognize a true path; light can drive away the treacherous and fearful darkness, light can awaken sleeping people, so everyone loves light.</p>
<p>I also love light, but I love the light in the night even more. I love the light in the night because nighttime is when darkness envelops the world, because nighttime is when people are tired and want to sleep, so nighttime needs the illumination of light the most, needs the stimulation of light the most, so the light in the night feels even more lovely.</p>
<p>I love light, who doesn't love light, but the light in the night is even more lovely! (Gratitude)</p>

<h3>Sword Dance in "The Gathering of Heroes"</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>It is said that the sword dance in "The Gathering of Heroes" started with Xu Xiaoxiang, then passed to Wang Lengxian, then to a certain amateur and Cheng Jixian and Xiao Changhua. Later, Xu Biyun and Ru Fulan were all good at this skill, and still followed the old path. Ye Sheng-lan's sword dance was taught by Ru Fulan, and corrected by Cheng Jixian. Li Debin is not weak either, because he also sought advice from Cheng Congxian. Now Xu Biyun has fallen into the northwest, and this tune has not been played for a long time. Although Ru Fulan has superb skills, limited by her voice, her reputation is overshadowed by Ye Sheng-lan; in fact, Sheng-lan's swordsmanship does not follow the old path. Feather shaking and quick steps are all found in "The Eight Hammers" and "Yue Family Village", and Sheng-lan inserts them into the sword dance. Isn't this inappropriate? In terms of swordsmanship, Cheng Jixian praised Ru Fulan, and Ru Fulan praised Li Debin. Ye Sheng-lan has formed his own school. Zhou Weijun and Gao Weilian are students of Jin Zhongren. Jin and Wang Youquan are also old actors in the current Xiaosheng role. Although they have sword dance, their skills are weak and not worth mentioning. Weilian and Jun are even more difficult to get good reviews.</p>
<p>In terms of reason, double swords are suitable for female roles. It is too effeminate for Xiaosheng to use them. It is said that originally single swords were used, but since Xu Xiaoxiang used double swords, later generations followed him (Xu originally sang female roles and later changed to Xiaosheng). It has been a long time since single swords have been seen on the stage. Zhao Ruitang, who came from Xiaojintai Opera School in the south, used to be in the Laogong stage before the tenth year of the Republic of China. He was good at Daoma Dan. Later, due to his voice failing, he made a living by telling stories. Zhao's "The Gathering of Heroes" is a single sword dance. I have seen a film of Li Jia Ban's female role Li Huimin's "The Gathering of Heroes" Zhou Yu, which is also a single sword.</p>
<p>The sword dance in this play and the sword dance of Mei, Cheng, Shang and Xu seem to be the same on the surface, but they are actually very different. The sword dance in female roles' plays is subject to the Huqin in terms of posture, steps, and sword techniques. Only the sword dance of Xiaosheng in "The Gathering of Heroes" uses the Suona card as an introduction, and the Chinese starts with walking gongs and drums, turning into rapid wind. The scene is controlled by the sword dancer, which is similar to the knife play in "Cui Ping Mountain" and the gun play in "Heaven State"; but there is also a distinction when it ends, which seems to be more difficult than the sword technique of "Farewell My Concubine", but it is actually easier than the sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine".</p>

<h3>My Opinion on Improving Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Song Ruinan</p>
<p>Music and Martial Arts</p>
<p>I always feel that Kunqu opera instruments are too simple and too noisy. So, on the one hand, we must try to use Chinese instruments as much as possible, and use Western instruments within the possible range (but not too Europeanized, otherwise it will become unharmonious), so that it has emotion and changes, and plays a role in strengthening the effect. At the same time, it is best to use noisy instruments such as big drums, big gongs, and trumpets less. As for the martial arts scenes, the less the better. In Yuan Dynasty dramas, the description of war is often replaced by the reports of scouts on military affairs, which is worth emulating. Of course, many martial arts are very consistent with the rhythm of "gongs and drums", but martial arts represent the duel of life and death, and now they have become rhythmic, which is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Scenery</p>
<p>Scenery can not only strengthen the atmosphere, but also make it easier for the audience to understand the background and content of the script. However, we must remember that the scenery is not a machine, otherwise it will become Shanghai-style Beijing opera. As for lighting, it can also be used.</p>
<p>What I have written above are all the words of an outsider like me, but objective facts force me to say something half-understood. There must be many errors, but I only hope to arouse the attention of those who love Kunqu opera and are committed to drama, so that everyone can put forward opinions and discuss them. I also hope that insiders can provide more opinions and be able to boldly experiment. Of course, failure is inevitable, but after reforming based on the experience of failure, it can be corrected to success. Even if it still fails in the end, it is still better than sitting idly by and watching Kunqu opera decline. (The End)</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Li Yuru and others have already sung "Farewell Commemoration" at the Golden Theater. According to Mr. Fei Mu, who has seen their "Mandarin Duck Tears", this play can be said to be a rare good play in terms of content, form, and the technology of this performance; this play is very popular in Peiping, and it has its own way of becoming popular.</p>
<p>I have never been very interested in Peking opera, so I was indifferent to Li Yuru and others coming to Shanghai. After hearing Mr. Fei Mu say this, I deeply regretted missing a good play. According to Peking opera's habit, after "Farewell Commemoration", there are usually a few days of "retention by all circles". I wonder if Li Yuru will perform "Mandarin Duck Tears" again during these few days of "retention by all circles"?</p>
<p>"China Travel" will perform at the Lyceum Theater. The first show is said to be "Hong Yijiao" starring Tang Ruoqing, written by Wei Ruhui, and directed by Fei Mu.</p>
<p>The Peking opera part of "Song of Ancient China" has been completely completed. What remains is the fashion part, which can be completed in at most a week. After everything is finished, the China-US Friendship Association will immediately hold it. The estimated date is around the 20th, and at the latest it will not be after the 26th, because "World Children" will start filming on the 26th.</p>
<h3>A Life of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The theory of fate has dominated the ruled class for thousands of years. Some people are restrained by adversity, unwilling, and start to struggle. If they encounter setbacks, the word fate suddenly appears in front of them, no different from a serious warning, so their courage suddenly disappears and they no longer dare to struggle.</p>

<p>Zhang Cangqiu became even more excited when talking about martial arts, his voice was loud and clear, and he talked endlessly. In an instant, it was dark. The two returned inside. Liu Yi held a red candle early. The two sat and talked about things on the border. Liu San came again to invite them to dinner. Xu Jing accompanied Zhang Cangqiu to the reception hall to drink face to face. In one day, Zhang Cangqiu had almost finished this jar of newly opened aged wine. Xu Jing, however, had drunk less than three catties, most of which went into his belly. Liu San on the side just stared in a daze. After dinner, Xu Jing held the lamp and led Zhang Cangqiu, took his package and precious sword, and pointed him to a small guest room on the east side to sleep. In front was Xu Jing's bedroom, separated only by a thin, low wall, with a door connecting them. Zhang Cangqiu had drunk a lot of wine and wanted to sleep, so he took off his clothes and fell asleep on the couch. Xu Jing went to the study again to read a book, but his eyelids immediately closed, and the sleeping demon had arrived, unable to support himself. He put down the book, stood up and wanted to return to his room to rest. He was a careful person, careful in everything. First, he went to see that his old mother was already fast asleep, and Liu San was still washing dishes in the stove. He told Liu Yi to be careful to close the front and back doors, and extinguish the fire. Liu San agreed obediently. He himself went to the courtyard to observe, and saw a hook-shaped crescent moon had emerged from the clouds, shining brightly on the west wall. The black horse was also lying on the ground, without a sound. Everything was quiet, and it was already after two o'clock. He also went to the study, took down the precious sword on the wall, returned to the room, put it next to his pillow, closed the door, turned off the light, and undressed to sleep. Perhaps due to mental excitement, he just tossed and turned on the Kang and couldn't fall asleep. He heard that Liu San was also asleep, and Zhang Cangqiu in the back guest room was snoring like thunder, which could be heard throughout the house. He was just about to calm down and fall asleep when he suddenly seemed to hear some slight noises in the study across the way. He thought to himself, could there be mice? Then he saw a small point of light flashing outside the window, and the guest's black horse suddenly neighed again. (10)</p>
