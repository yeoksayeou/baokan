<h3>日重臣推薦首相人選　近衛三度組織新閣　新內閣閣員名單尚未宣布　重光有繼松岡任日外相說</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　日皇本日命令近衛組織新內閣、近衛係於昨日與其內閣全體辭職、但奉日皇之命留職、今午復奉召進宮、其後在宮中舉行之重臣之特別會議後、日皇即令近衛組織新內　、此間日本通訊社宣稱、日本之重臣、今午在宮中集議、以決定首相人選、重臣中大都係以前曾任首相者、其中有掌璽大臣木戶侯爵、樞密院院長原博士·暨林上將·若槻男爵·岡田海軍上將·米內海軍上將·阿部上將·及廣田等、內閣咨議會今晨在首相宮邸召集、閣員皆向近衛提出辭職、內閣重要官員、如秘書長富田·支法局局長村瀨·及設計局總裁鈴木中將等、亦皆提出辭職、都市警察總監山峙及內務省次官萱塲、亦辭職云、</p>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　近衛於日皇命共組織新閣後、今晚已請日皇假以時日、俾改組內閣、聞近衛現正積極組織新閣、此舉若果成就、則將正式接受日皇命其仍爲首相之諭旨、近衛奉日皇命其組閣之命令後、曾與宮內大臣作一度商談、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　今日午後六時二十五分、近衛人宮作四十分鐘之覲見後、全國仍企待近衛是否已接受組織新閣敕令之消息、因傳近衛出宮後未直接返家而訪問內相平沼、遂引起種種揣測、按事前已證實近衛奉召入宮後、將奉命另組新閣、日皇由葉山離宮返京後、曾立即召見掌璽大臣木戶、因其負有將重臣會議所推選之新閣員名單呈報日皇也、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　今日下午近衛奉召人宮、日皇命其組織新閣、衆信近衛將予接受、一般民衆對此消息均表欣慰、蓋有多人深恐極端份子如來次海軍大將者、或將奉命領導新閣也、近衛於下午四時十五分離寓、五時到達皇宮、組閣事宜隨即開始、日皇立即接見、後近衛又在另窒中與掌璽大臣木戶會商、歷半小時之久、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　今日下午一時日本掌璽大臣木戶、召集重臣特別會議、擬決定新首相之人選、元老制似有復活之象、內閣顧問會議曾於今晨十一時在首相官邸舉行最後一次常會、會議畢、閣員十二人即向近衛照例提出辭呈、內閣辭職、乃於昨夜十一時十五分山情報局主任伊藤發表文吿如下、現內閣於去夏由御勅授命、此後乃一體勉力制定並進行內國與外交政策、深覺迅速完成並鞏固內部機構實屬急不容緩、而最重者、尤爲在此世界大局變遷無定之際、能竭力實行國家政策、茲因內閣之組織、急宜實施澈底之改革、故已決議全體辭職、首相近衛、巳在內閣特別會議中、收集其同僚之辭呈、而於夜九時赴葉山行宮呈遞日皇、日皇日后均予慰留、命暫理國政、以得新首相之任命、首相即以是轉吿其同僚云、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　外相松岡之病况、無减輕徵象、仍留居家中、曾召家庭醫生診視、</p>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　據今晨官方吿稱、近衛首相、因日本應迅速加强內部政治機構、故要求內閣提出辭職、內閣在昨日五時三十分召開緊急閣議後、即提陽全體辭職、但至深夜、始經宣佈、</p>
<h3>國聯秘書長　發表報告　聲明仍繼續工作</h3>
<p>路透社十七日日內瓦電國聯秘書長萊斯特之一九四一年報吿書、聲明國聯現任進行其工作、並謂國聯人員與預算經費均已大减、而一部份巳遷加拿大、國際勞工局已縮小範圍、仍在日內瓦工作、國聯秘書處續以關於衛生·營養·居住·社會協助、保護靑年、援助難民與禁毒之有用情報、供給政府、該報告書中又表示其見解稱、戰後負責政治家須恢復國際生活綫構、以免復肇戰爭悲劇云、</p>
<h3>內閣辭職主要原因由於國際形勢突變</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電今日日文報紙一般咸謂近衛首相內閣之辭職、在於便利政府之迅速改組、以發揮全國之最高力量、衆認爲此乃促令日本應付不斷變化之世界局勢所必需、報紙大事登載天皇縮短其在葉山別墅之暑假、因天皇對目前局面之極端嚴重之關切也、「朝日新聞」稱、近衛政府已採取七月二日御前會議所決定之政策、向完成其應付蘇德戰事爆發後新局勢之計劃、政治觀察家頃方注視該官方尙未正式宣佈之最高政策、是否將予以修改、此次辭職、雖謂係因加强國內機構之需要、惟繼續上台之政府之主要關切、厥係外交政策云、</p>
<h3>美認近衛內閣傾覆與軸心國壓力有關</h3>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓電昨晚此間各報皆以大字登載日內閣辭職之簡略消息、觀察家現紛紛研究近衛倒閣之原因、惟傳來情報、現甚簡單、東方傳來柏林壓力、殆與日閣傾覆有該官吿云、「現時之內閣自去夏成立以來、對內外事務、執行不遺餘力、政府現感到欲求有效地施行國策起見、殊有迅速加强內部機構及予以改組之必要、是以近衛首相即要求閣員提出辭職、天皇已溫獎近衛首相、囑其暫行留職、以待後命、近衛首相爰乃以天皇此意轉致全體閣員矣」、同時東京日文報紙、預測蘇德戰事、在九月初將進入「險重之階段」、並稱「日本現時必需有所行動」、各報並鄭重指出、解決「中國」事件及加速南進之必要、泰國院日公使辛納咋日下午與日外務省官吏及法國駐日大使亨利會商、並將消夏之日期加以展期、又據此間一般人士之意見、近衛內閣之辭職、實由蘇德戰事及日文報紙一致要求政府、應極度增强所促成、東京報紙表示新內閣或將由海陸兩省顯着人物所組成、並將爲一較强之內閣、然新閣人選如何、尙不可知、衆信日本駐英大使重光葵或將繼松岡出任外相、至於首相人選、衆以爲有陸軍要人三人、及海軍大將一人頗有希望、一爲高麗總督南大將、一爲西尾大將、一爲高麗駐軍司令板垣大將、一爲末次海軍大將、</p>
<p>重慶十七日電　據同盟社廣播東京十七日電、重臣會議、已已於今日下午一時五十八分完畢、內大臣木戶即將進宮向日皇推虅後任內閣人選、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　近衛會於今日下午五時十分觀見日皇、惟至五時半尚無公告發表、今晨近衛尚未起床時、其官邸四周已擁滿官史新聞記者及民衆、上午十一時近衛起床後、第一進見者爲前任秘書森重、一小時後其秘書二人相繼入見、惟不久即出、宜布舉行重臣會議、</p>
<h3>日報對新內閣人選保持緘默未加揣測</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電東京之日文報紙、本日皆不若往昔之推測新內閣之人選、此足見新頒之國防保障法、對報紙拑制之嚴格、各報甚至對於繼近衛而仟首相之人選、亦未提及、但消息靈通方面則謂、彼等相信新政府將施行小內閣制、俾對重要問題、能作迅速決斷、米內內閣以前之阿部內閣、亦曾冀圖實行小內閣、但未成功、但東京各報皆一致謂內閣之辭職、乃欲便利政府之澈底改組、以發展國家之最大力量、欲使日本能應付不斷變動之世界情况、此舉實屬必要云、</p>
<p>金要關係之說、此間人士認爲事非無因、如日閣改組、果以此爲一原因、則德國之壓迫日本參戰、徒表示德國攻蘇、未能適如其預定計劃進行順利、而欲日本突刺蘇聯後背耳、若干觀察家認近衛內閣之傾覆、爲一種佳兆、因日本內部意見參差、而北進或南進、一時未必即實現也、此間人士現注視日本新內閣之性質、衆信現任外相松岡、最未有加入新內閣之希望、</p>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓電　國務副卿威爾斯吿新聞記者、關於日內閣辭職事、渠尙未接正式情報云、國務院人員在未接詳報時、不願發表任何批評、據官塲意見、日本保守事業派似已迫令軍閥所操縱之政府下台、果爾、則此事對於美國極有重大關係、聞羅斯福總統早料日本將發生閣潮、故在最近數星期中、避免對日之任何嚴重衝突、蓋日本事業界對美較爲友好、而不甚願對軸心國合作也、據此問若干觀察家之意見、英美在太平洋之堅決政策、不無推翻日本外交政策之力、而英蘇友好條約、亦使日本陷於窘境、故國內民情不滿、事業界之手腕或因此而愈强、</p>
<h3>日親軸心派如得勢或將不顧一切南進</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日華盛頓電</p>
<p>國務院昨日拒絕評論日本內閣辭職之事、惟非官方人士稱、此乃日本國內兩派人士火併之結果、其中一派主張積極援助軸心、另一派則主張與英美改善關係、此間對何派將取得新政權一事、尙不可知、惟專家稱、親軸。派如獲勝利、則日駐義大使白烏之流勢將出任外相、又稱、白烏之流勢將撕毀蘇日中立條約、以爲可能地攻擊海參崴之前奏、日本並或將南進、尤其攻佔康瀾灣（在越南）、親英美派如獲勝利、則重光葵或將出任外相、屆時則日本對軸心關係、即將鬆弛、此間認爲內閣旣係被急進派所推倒、則一俟新閣組成、此急進派或將採取武力行動云、此間政界方面頃認爲、海部宣佈在馬尼刺及蘇比克海灣敷雷、表示美國已準備應付日本之南進、衆認此係事前措施、以免日本因援助德國及抽身於遠東困難之外時、企圖封鎖美國在菲列濱之軍隊、一方面則以主力南進荷印新加坡及康瀾灣各點、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日內閣的更迭</h3>
<p>正在舉世注視日本動向之際，近衛內閣突然提出總辭職，於是這一存在了恰滿一年的「新體制」內閣，乃隨着蘇德戰事的爆發而宣吿傾圯。在形式上，這幾乎完全是平沼內閣覆轍的重演。</p>
<p>自從中日戰事開始以來，日內閣已更迭到五次，局部改組更僕難數，即在近衛再度登台的一年間，已有七次之多，平均每度內閣的壽命不過十個月，而政情則幾乎沒有三個月以上的髯靜。這種情形，即在平時，亦復表現着政局的極度不安，至於一個戰時的國家，則幾乎很難在歷史上找到同樣的前例。單從政情上做片面的觀察，已不難體會今日之日本正臨到何等的艱困和難關。</p>
<p>此度日閣之倒，直接是受了蘇德戰爭的影響，至於倒閣者究爲急進派抑或保守份子，目前尙不能充分判明。以意度之，邇來日方朝野雖議論紛紜，極見喧囂。而在急進與保守兩派勢力之間，幾於勢均力敵，任何一方面都還沒有絕對把握政局的力量，是以與其說日閣是因爲遭受攻擊而辭職，無髯認爲是近衛等自已感到無法撑持而求去。蘇德戰爭的爆發，確是近年來國際政局中一件雖然事有必至但又十分突元的事，各個關係國家，在戰事消息傳播之初，都未免感到相當震驚，而以對於蘇德雙方都負有條約義務的日本爲尤甚，日本志在擴展其在國際間的親疏離合，殆無不以是吾利於其擴展企圖爲轉移；三國同盟與中立協定，在事前都經過悠久的倡導和深刻的考慮，然後始在絕對有利的判斷之下力排萬難，乃底於成。但是及至條約締結之後，國際局勢的發展竟與日當局最初所估量者全然背道而馳，納粹固然未能於數星期之內侵佔英倫，歐局的發展也未能使英美無力兼顧遠東，日本之所得於三國同盟及中立協定者，只有相互矛盾勢難兩全的條約義務，到最後更陷於徬徨無所適從。這誠然是松岡外交的重大失敗，同時也是近衛政權的重大失敗，因爲事實上，松岡實無異於近衛內閣的靈魂；但這却不盡是松岡個人的責任。松岡外交的作風，是一種建立在急端份子擴展要求之上的現實的機會主義，自身缺乏定見和卓識，只想利用國際間的有利機會來取巧，其遭失敗，原無足異。但是日本在此種處境之下，其對外政策實無法陳義過高，以松岡較之其前任的有田野村之流，不能不承認松岡八面玲瓏。在外交上的成就已遠超過了其歷屆的前任，但其結果却不過陷自身於進退維谷的困境，這一情形是日本的擴展政策與內外處境所造成的命運，絕非任何枝葉上的努力或成就所能挽回。</p>
<p>當去夏近衛東山再起之初。挾有「新政體制運動」的腹案，儼以「昭和維新」深自期許，抱負不凡，聲勢煊赫，逈非歷屆日閣所能比擬。世人懲於已往的經騐，本不敢對其懷有過高的期望，但亦未嘗不冀其於澈底檢討現行政策之餘。能夠懸崖勒馬，把日本從無底的擴展企圖之中拯救出來。但結果不只這種期望完全落空，其所恃爲號召之資的「新政體制運動」亦復一再蜕變，在名義上旣降爲「大政翼贊」，其改革計畫又以遭遇抨擊而全吿擱置。到今春第十六屆議會之後竟至消聲匿跡，連「大政翼贊」的名詞也不多見提起。而另一方面，旣成政黨則已完全宣告解散，致使日本政局旣非民治，又有異於獨裁，政府與人民之間，幾於形成脫臼狀態。在政策上，則一味追隨着軍人的擴展慾求與松岡的現實外交，而尤以對華戰爭之無法解決形成絕大苦悶，致使際此歐戰良機竟不能在任何方面有所發展。三國同盟的締結只是招致了國際間無數重壓和叢怨，及至今春以來，又復銳意緩和英美關係，汲引小倉正恒入閣以取得財閥及溫和份子對內閣的助力；但是日閣本體，業已病入膏肓，即無蘇德戰爭之加以絕大困窘，其軍事外交上的苦悶已使近衛無法支撑下去。</p>
<p>現在日閣已告傾圯，但是日本當前的難題絕不僅是人事上的更迭所能爲力。四年來的經過於此已有充分的例證，以近衛個人的人望，新政運動的聲威，其已往成就不過如此。更何况目前尙無更勝於近衛的人物。急進派與保守份子的雙方陣營中固不乏首相候補者的存在，但二者都還沒有號召全國的力量，以是終於近衛捲土重來。雖然內閣陣綫，尙待揭露，但就今晨電訉所傳，外相一席，以重光葵呼聲最高，果爾，是保守份子略佔優勢。但這回近衛三度組閣，如果仍依違兩可，缺乏大智大勇，不把日本內外政策幡然政圖，則其未來的命運，也未必不重踏其前兩度的覆轍。</p>
<h3>重慶各報咸認日本或將又有冒險行動</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日重慶電此間報紙、本日一致以爲日內閣之辭職、乃日本又將在東亞有冒險行動之先兆、此種行動、或將引起日本之敗亡、陸軍機關掃蕩報及有勢力之大公報皆謂、無論日本南進或北進、皆有在後方受攻擊之虞、掃蕩報稱、「蘇聯及美國已決定合作、因此如日木開始攻擊海參崴或赤塔、則美國海軍必在太平洋擾日本之後、而華軍亦將作總反攻、日本軍閥不計及此種成因、而任性的開始其新冒險行動、結果或使彼等敗亡」、大公報則稱、「美國及蘇聯已決定在南太平洋及北太平洋採共同行動、」該報又謂近衛內閣之辭職、僅係日本冀圓諉卸其在蘇日中立公約下之義務、大公報又預言、如新內閣之首相爲朝鮮總督南次郞或朝鮮衛戍司令板垣中將、則日本必將立即參加戰爭云、</p>
<p>路透社十七日重慶電　中央日報今日載　諭、調　衛內閣因內外交迫、乃不得不出於辭職之一途、內閣倒因雖尙未悉其詳、但可信其不陽下列三因、（一）最近御前會議之決議、已在閣內外遭遇有力之反對、（二）新政治機構遭遇種種阻力、尤其爲新經濟機構、（二）內閣因財政困難、不能製定下一財政年度之預算案、該文又謂、自蘇德戰爭開始後、日本與軸心國問之主要供給綫、業已封閉、此亦增重內閣困難之一、近衛內閣之倒、如果出於極右份子之反對、則敢料新閣亦必遭同樣命運、掃蕩報謂近衛內閣乃由軍部竭力反對其政策、尤其爲外交政策所致、反對黨領袖久原現力主日本應加入德義方面參戰、松岡於內閣辭職前即未出席閣議、足徵日本最近之政潮、多因對於外交政策意見紛歧之故、</p>
<p>路透社十七日重慶電　此間消息靈通之華方人士於詳述近衛重任爲新閣首相時、認爲此舉並不出人意料、蓋此次內閣之倒、係由於軍部對最近御前會議所決定、靜待及觀察之政策表示不滿、日本在目前旣不能北攻、又不能南進、大約須覓一新首相之能渡過現時猶豫不決時期者、故以近衛爲最合邏輯之人選云、</p>

<h3>詩人楊雲史</h3>
<p>— 大椿</p>
<p>詩人楊圻雲史，世人譽爲江東才子，頃據港電，遽病歿香島，識與不識，曾讀楊氏詩文者，咸爲之惋惜雪涕。楊氏常熟人，隨吳子玉將軍有年，氣骨矯然。中日戰起，楊走香港，以詩文自遺，著有江山萬里樓詩集，傳誦士林。夫人娶李經芳長女霞客，早故。</p>
<p>氏生平文采風流，豪放不　，年千九，館於南鄕秦氏，秦有女名珊媛，腎淑端莊，鍾情於楊，卒以五陵子弟，爭相委禽，事遂未諧，女亦悒悒而歿，雲史以詩悼之，詩云：「鶯燕還能話舊時，不堪重讀定情詩，鈿盟釵約成塵土，我虔心傷杜牧之。」「萬里江山淚有痕，歸來匹騎賦招魂，碧空有約春無據，夜夢飛尋第幾門」。</p>
<p>後過漢上，于風塵中，邂逅陳美美，以陳貌似其已故夫人，頗眷注之。別後楊作躑躅詞十二絕，有「絃索凄淸見淚痕，江花小宴到王孫，潯陽東下無消息，決絕溫存兩斷魂。」「水柳靑靑草滿地，子規聲急盡情啼，鬥前萬里桃花浪，送到江南又海西。」等。</p>
<p>楊曾爲姬人狄美美作燕歸來詞，一時海內騷人，和者甚衆。</p>
<p>民十四，曾有某氏女，讀楊氏詩文，慕其才，自署芳菲菲榭女士投函楊氏，願委身相事，楊卒婉謝之，其書旋爲人覓得，揭諸報端，傳誦海內。</p>
<p>戰後，楊即南行，憂心世事，曾作楊柳枝曲，有一折柳攀條滿水濱，年年送客過天津，今年過客無人送，都作銷魂萬里人。」之句，其去國懷　之情，躍然紙上。另有憶當熟一詩，亦感慨甚深，詩云：「故鄉奇勝甲天下，拳石撮土無痴頑，南尋邱壑不如意，益思吳越深長嘆。近時邊瘴皆樂士，一念家山淸淚潛，自唴衰病筋力軟，當前峯壑愁躋攀。山靈笑我不深入，空抱瑣骨鳴珊珊。」以見楊氏寄慨之深，今竟不幸，天奪耆宿，歿於香港，他年楊氏昆仲吿祭母忘，楊氏當可瞑目矣！</p>

<h3>俄人分析遠東局勢　日殆將攫佔越南　藉以鞏固南太平洋據點　在目前尚不致冒險北進</h3>
<p>本埠俄文日報、對日本今後之動向、昨日曾著文評論、認在蘇聯實力未崩潰前、日人必先鞏固越南及泰國之南進根據地、一時不致北進、持論甚爲精闢、茲迻譯原文於後、「世人於慶祝英蘇協定之餘、頃又注意遠東局勢之發展、而太平洋西部問題、尤爲一般外交界與記者所關切、實非偶然、</p>
<p>日本尚在等待機會</p>
<p>日本今後將出以何種行動、此爲我人迫切求瞭解者、依據日方報紙記載及官員談話、則日本目前、似將採取「警戒待時而動」政策、而不致突然有所行動、惟眞意何在、現尙無蛛絲馬跡可尋、良以日方報紙所記載之文字、類多引證世界各國對此一問題之論據而已、</p>
<p>越南殆成南進階梯</p>
<p>我人就過去若事件過程判斷、日人必在越南及泰國、先行鞏固其南進根據地、今日人在越南與海南島、沒收美國貨物之舉、迭有所聞、此足證日人執行其侵略政策時、固不忘情於加强該區之控制、越南殆已成爲日本南進之階梯、以其由該地進襲泰國有如探囊取物、蓋日人在泰國、早有根深蒂固之基礎也、</p>
<p>冒險北進尚非其時</p>
<p>然則此並非否認日人不敢北進之謂、我人僅稱日人在目前　決不致北進、以日本有事於中國、一時不易跳出靴關、且對南洋方面、早已躍躍欲試、今欲改弦易轍、移師北進、後果如何、實難預卜、故我人認爲日人必在南海加强其政治勢力、並鞏固其在越南之根據地、然後再冒險北進、妄想染指濱海省、然英蘇協定甫經簽訂、國際情勢一變、對此冒險行動、似尙無有利之處、</p>
<p>英美決助蘇聯奮鬥</p>
<p>目日本如一旦北進、侵入蘇聯、美國亦不致漠然置之、屆時定爲蘇聯之後援無疑、說者謂美國將對日人北進予以默契、俾得解除日人對自國之威脅、余則對此一主張、實不敢苟同、定人誠然咸知英美與共產主義格格不入、然大敵未除、希特勒苟仍跋扈於人間、可斷言兩國必援助蘇聯奮鬥、</p>
<p>故弄狡獪使人迷惘</p>
<p>日人於目前、所以不敢遞而發動北進者、蓋欲待蘇德戰事結　束之揭曉、惜乎此非短期內所可預卜、德人深入蘇境、雖爲事實、然決不能侈言勝利、即就日人方面之覜察、亦知德蘇戰事、德人將無法使蘇聯屈膝、苟如是、則日人無需待此戰結果之分曉固彰彰明甚矣、就日人心理方面推測、則日人慣技、輒故意混淆所發之脾、使人迷惘、莫辨其動向、</p>
<p>關鍵在於蘇德決戰</p>
<p>如我人對來自各方有關太平洋之消息、加以粽合及分析、當如後述、日本有南進決心、爲欲加速其行動、故擬佔領越南、在該處建築海空軍根據地、俾他日美國在太平洋甫面發動攻勢時、予以打擊、如美國積　極支持英國在西綫作戰、日本將不受美國在東方之牽制、故於鞏固南海之根據地後、即可貿然圖北進一逞、惟此事之發動、必須有另一事實、爲其先決條件、即蘇聯對德軍之失其抵抗力、對日軍行動亦感棘手、如是、日人方敢暢所欲爲、</p>
<p>未來局勢無庸悲觀</p>
<p>國際局勢之未來發展、果不幸若是邪、有識之士、當不作如是觀、因日人在歐戰結果、德國淪陷區之情况、以及美國　對英國之關係、在此種種未　明瞭前、日本當不敢在北方有軍事冒險行動、世界局勢、瞬息萬變、日本刻正與英美德蘇　各國相同、審愼將事、不得不對其政策之決定、有審愼密之考慮、然不論日本國策有何變更、日本嗣後將從事更擴大之侵略行爲、此則我人敢斷言者也、</p>

<p>昨　洋米市况尙形平正、然比之前日仍見盤落數角至近元不等、蓋目下存底日加、到頭不絕、邇日港到小絞與越到碎米均有大量平價供給本街公賣、人心不免虛軟、故早市一度平盤後、繼即疲落、落後又引起浮多趁小吸收、市又回站、惟供多銷細、人心依然軟弱、碎米有大批新到、現貨已跌開一百零六元、期一百零八元至一百〇七元半、二號暹米一百四十元至一百四十元〇八角、小紋現一百四十七元、期一百四十九元八角至一百四十八元五角、全日成交近千噸、現貨開一萬二三千包、小紋自一百二十元〇五角小至一百十九元、次一百十八元、一號一百二十八元及一百二十六元、二號一百十六元半、碎米九十二元半、次九十元〇五角、</p>

<h3>談談「申報助學金」</h3>
<p>— 堅頌</p>
<p>請大家努力援助，義不容辭！</p>
<p>賑濟赤貧，在中國，也是在「美德」之列的。但人們却往往不根究貧窮的原因，和怎麼會有窮人與富人之別的社會根源，而只知道窮人總是窮人，不是「命苦」，就是「前世註定」而已。</p>
<p>求學，也是如此。只有富人子弟可以出入於堂堂「學府」之門，窮措大的小子，是休想的了。但窮人們亦就糊裏糊塗「自嘆命薄」算了。</p>
<p>可是，我們也嘗見富家公子小姐，就往往是以爲書爲名，而晝夜進出於「歌台舞榭」，「酒樓茶室」，其數不能說不多，這誠然是民族，國家，甚至是整個世界人類的莫大損失。而小姐公子們的生活，要不是在「戀愛至上圈」裏打滾，就是黃浦江，來沙兒中間尋「出路」而「輕生」了之。這不能不使人深爲痛心，而替這般「無爲靑年」嘆惜。</p>
<p>而相反的，我們常聽見「窮門出貴子」的所謂「老話」。其實，倒是眞的，我們常看見克苦奮鬥，力求上進，學行兼優的學生，就往往被窮小子佔去了好些。</p>
<p>可是，能進學校的窮小子，到底還是少數中的少數，而有着一個絕對大多數的兒童，是被屛棄在學堂的大門外邊，連想進小學都不可得，至於中學與大學，那眞叫「望塵莫及」了。</p>
<p>可是，誰敢保證，在這絕大多數的孩子中開，沒有出類拔萃的的優秀人才呢？誰又敢說這是社會所造成的呢？誰又敢說，這不是民族國家的損失呢？</p>
<p>在這裏，我們可以說「申報助學金」此舉很有意義。我們不能眼看着在沒有實行「國民敎育」之前，在社會沒有澈底改造之前，就不設法來局部的改善現行的設施。同時我們更不能眼看着國家的一大損失，不起來設法補救。</p>
<p>所以，我們說：「助學金」，是急需在今天廣泛地推行的一種運動，它決不僅限於申報，限於上海一隅，而是有着全國性的一秤事業。因爲窮孩子的要求讀書，與其說是國家給他們的一種權利，我想，倒不如說是國民所應盡的義務來得好些。</p>
<p>因此，助學金不僅是一種「善舉」，而是有益於國家民族的一種事業，這意義，千萬不能忽略了。這裏，願由申報廣大地發展開來。</p>
<h3>會話談</h3>
<p>— 沛倫</p>
<p>甲姝（不平地）：哥哥！女人一定不能自立嗎？</p>
<p>男甲（爽直地）：你並不漂亮。</p>
<p>問：老李！你打算考那一校？</p>
<p>答：我嗎？假使考不取　　化學工程系，那就考　　會計系。</p>
<p>商科敎師甲（怨恨地）：這幾個上學期不及格的學生眞混帳，昨天補考時竟一個也不到，難道都忘了嗎？</p>
<p>敎師乙（未說先笑）：他們大概以爲去年存入之分數，應有利息，加上半年「利息」，不是可以及格了嗎？</p>
<h3>又一小統計</h3>
<p>— 姚權</p>
<p>據我用頭號洋米來實騐，一碗米重九兩，有一萬五千四百四十多粒，一兩就有一千七百十多粒，市上一石米是一百六十斤，即一升是一·六斤，即二十五·六兩，所以一升是四萬四千四百多粒，一斗是四十四萬四千多粒，一石是四百四十四萬多粒，目今市價一百三十元，即一升値一元三角，一兩値五分一厘弱，一碗値四角五分七厘强，一粒値十萬份之三十分左右。</p>
<h3>路燈的功績</h3>
<p>— 湯幼梅</p>
<p>我們弄內的那盞路燈，牠有不少的功績：</p>
<p>（一）來來往往的行人，不會被垃圾堆扳得「翻跟斗」。</p>
<p>（二）小孩子在半夜裏還可以在那裏玩耍。</p>
<p>（三）對門的四位麻將嫂嫂，能廢物利用，在牠的下面一打麻將」，據她們說：這是「電流節約」！</p>
<h3>介紹</h3>
<p>— 凌中祿</p>
<p>乞丐：大小姐，做做好事，給我幾分錢，讓我買隻大餅吃吃。……</p>
<p>摩登女郞：向我討是沒有的，我替你介紹一位。（用手指着前面一個穿西裝靑年。）</p>
<p>「媽媽，這樣熱的天氣，他們爲什麼還穿許多衣服？</p>
<p>— C.T.作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「啊！嫂子。」梅寳立刻打斷了自己所想着的心事，旋過頭去陪着笑回答。「多謝您，似乎好些了，今兒倒喝了兩碗麵湯！」</p>
<p>孟家的媳婦很伶俐地替她把藥罐上的蓋子揭開了一些，免得議煮滾了的藥汁淌出來。</p>
<p>「麵湯可不大好，其實應該喝一些藕粉，才是大病以後最有益處的東西！」她一面在一張竹椅上坐下去，一面很關切地說。</p>
<p>「這東西現在怕不很貴嗎？」梅寳茫無所知地問。</p>
<p>「也並不怎樣貴。」孟家的媳婦放低了聲音說：「妹妹，我說了你可別當我是給咱們家拉賣買，要是想買眞藕粉的話，咱們舖子裏有的是。大概三毛錢一匣也就够了，這東西對於害過大病的人，好處倒是有的！」</p>
<p>梅寳放下了手裏的葵扇，略略躊躇了一二分鐘。</p>
<p>「咱們先買兩盒試試行不行？」她從右邊的衣袋裏，掏出幾個小銀元來數着。「勞你駕先把錢帶了去吧！」</p>
<p>孟家的媳婦忙着搖手止住。</p>
<p>「不忙，待我拿了來再算錢吧！」</p>
<p>「那有什麽客氣呢？」梅寳硬生生地把六毛錢塞進了對方的手掌裏去。「可是，好嫂子，回頭您見了我爸爸，可別吿訴他這個價錢；他一聽三毛錢一盒，準會心痛得不肯再吃的！」（一六一）</p>
<p>囤積世家</p>
<h3>有此你必有此子</h3>
<p>— 煜兒</p>
<p>死不帶去　生不帶來　令朗跨竃　囤積棺蓋</p>
<p>鐘聲響了三下，這是預定大殮的時候，許多親友都聚集在禮堂裏預備瞻仰遺容，叩頭執紼，忽然有人在人叢中大聲地說：</p>
<p>「棺材蓋不見了，這甚麼辦呀！」</p>
<p>這樣激起了一陣嘈雜的聲音，大家議論粉紛，我弄得莫名其妙，還是旁邊有位老頭子喃喃地吿訴我說：</p>
<p>「這位去世的老先生有很多的財產遺下來，他的三個兒子因分遺產而起爭執，大的說小的暗地裏吃沒了他父親不少的遺產，小的說大的因職務上的便利「楷油」了很多的錢，互相指摘，互相爭論，不知那個兒子竟把棺材蓋設法藏去了，大約作爲要分得滿意的遺產的要挾。」</p>
<p>我只是點着頭。他喝了一口茶，摸摸八字式的鬍鬚又繼續的說下去：</p>
<p>「這位老爺『眼光』眞好，他的幾千包米上賺進了不少的錢，他手裏還有數百包；囤煤，囤火油，國火柴，……莫不賺錢。他自己又節儉得很，不肯浪費一個錢，烟酒都不吃，他一個子從來不上館吃一頓飯或一頓點心的，出外總是勞他的兩隻脚，身上所穿的衣服都是破舊的，所以他能够有這許多的財產呀！我在生意上靠他很多的福……」他說到這梗住了，眼睛也紅了起來。</p>
<p>「那麼生啥病死去的呀！我問</p>
<p>「喔！中風死的。昨天早晨在我家和我商量囤點麵粉還是好好的一個。」帶着哀痛的語調回答着。</p>
<p>我只是潑牢騷地說：</p>
<p>「錢是生不帶來，死不帶去，何必要這樣呢？發了很多的財，無非作了子孫的牛馬，結果兩手空空倒造成了閱牆之爭，不得安殮。……」</p>
<p>時光無情地溜去，時候已屆黃昏，屍體因天氣炙熱，發出陣陣的臭味，令人作嘔</p>
<p>我也等不得這位囤積者的入殮，就踏上我的歸途。</p>

<h3>朗博士</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>「德國柏林大學化學博士，染化學會會員，工程師學會永久會員，　　化學工業廠廠長，　　機械製造廠董事………」</p>
<p>單憑郞博士的一張名片，就很够瞧的了！</p>
<p>博士的輪廓非常淸楚：笨牛般的身體，配上縮着的頭頸，老鼠眼，大嘴吧，兩只風箏式耳朶。</p>
<p>一定的，隨時隨地，他總得含着一枝捲烟，「Q」形地掛在脣皮上。</p>
<p>博士雖身爲廠長，但他很難得到廠裏去，工塲裏更不屑一跑了，偶然一次台駕，就是翻一下產額表，喝半杯紅茶完事，他儘喜歡去「總公司」，在經理室裏跟着經理先生幫腔，湊個熱鬧。</p>
<p>第一句開塲白總是：「當我在柏林的時候……」；接着，他會說到天上的星一共是幾粒，月亮和地球遲早有相碰的一天，希特勒的髮式是他祖母秘授的，史太林的八字鬚每天梳兩次……</p>
<p>他也會設到白糖梅子的酸性作用是屬於某一個化學原子的，廣東乳腐和紹興乾菜營養的比較，甚至「這次中跑馬頭獎的葡僑，曾與我在柏林同乘過地底火車」……再來一個「當我在柏林的時候」結束。</p>
<p>不到五分鐘，另一個「當我在柏林……」又起始了！</p>
<p>博士雖閑得可以，但他決不因此偷懶，誰的事情，他却得管一下：</p>
<p>—嗐，打也不會打，打什麽領結！</p>
<p>—多漂亮的旅袍爲什麼不配上一雙德國皮鞋？</p>
<p>—你上當了，鏡片最好的讓還德國貨。</p>
<p>晚間，即博士活躍的一段了，從電影院到酒吧間，從跳舞塲到夜花園，酒娘，舞娘，麻醉了博士的每一根神經綫—博士的頭更緊縮了，甚至見不到脖子！</p>
<p>博士手中，經常拿着一份德僑日報，案頭上放着德文字典，染色工程學，化學百科全書（當然都是德文的）！</p>
<p>博士最大的遺憾，就是：「中國的德文太不普遍」，使博士滿腹「德寳」無從展示，實在是太可惜的事！</p>
<p>也許有人以爲博士是一位德僑？非也！郞博士的籍贯，是道地的：</p>

<h3>影事漫談</h3>
<p>好萊塢有兩個「三兄弟」，一是李滋三兄弟，一是馬克司三兄弟。這六個寳貝都以滑糟的小丑角色在影片中和我們相見。倘使說得再稍爲切實一些，這六個寳貝所扮演的角色和動作，實在還配不上說「滑稽」，而祇能說是胡鬧，毫不入情的胡鬧，其動作大多是插科打　，肉麻當有趣而已。</p>
<p>其實，扮演滑稽角色是最不容易的，其目的當然在引觀衆發笑，可是，並不是在使觀衆一笑之後，便永遠忘懷了，在心中絲毫沒留下什麼印象。滑稽的動作應當在使衆觀大笑之外，再給觀衆以一種啓示的。</p>
<p>把李滋三兄弟及馬克司三兄弟來和卓別林一比，便可知道了。由此可見滑稽角色並不是容易扮演的。畫虎不成反類犬，也可以用在此地作爲一個譬喻。在這兩個『三兄弟』中，比較起來，還是李滋三兄弟的演技稍爲好一些吧。</p>
<h3>影星的家</h3>
<p>— 竇俊</p>
<p>「家」正在國聯攝製中，該片有兩個女主角，都於最近期內搬家，一位是飾「琴」的陳雲裳，一位是飾「嗚鳳」的陳燕燕。</p>
<p>大家都知道，陳雲裳原來住在巨籟遠路自明公寓一號三樓的，前月因舊居不敷應用，一度曾喬遷至福開森路居爾典路三百十八號，屋殊寬敞，且有小花園，綠茵滿地，野花怒放，柳絲拂地，景色相當佳麗。惟陳雲裳又因該地過於潮濕，已由居爾典路遷至享利路杜美路的一所小洋房。新居一進門便是小花園，有軟綿綿的柳絲，也有艷麗的花朶，夏天納凉，確是勝地。</p>
<p>陳燕燕原居於霞飛路底可的牛奶公司對面的林肯公寓內，袁美雲未搬入愛多亞路恒業里時，也是住在林肯公寓的。公寓的房開都尙稱寬暢，惟最近陳燕燕凶該處合同期滿後，就着手進行遷居了。陳燕燕和黃紹芬的新居，就是以前陳雲裳所住的那個自明公寓，但不是和以前陳雲裳所居同一的房間。年來海上人滿爲患，每個人都覺得居處不易，看得影星們住着高樓大厦，誠不勝其艷羨了。</p>

<h3>憶貴俊卿之落魄</h3>
<p>— 景邨</p>
<p>近兩月間，言菊朋宋寶羅紀玉良暨坤伶徐東明等蒞滬，於空城計一劇，皆數度演唱，因追念已故之譚派鬚生貴俊卿，尤爲傑構，百聽不厭，當年有活孔明雅號，手執羽扇，瀟灑目在之姿態，目今伶人，無與倫比！綜其一生露演最久之地，厥惟芝罘瀛洲丹桂天仙各戲園，相互輪流，倚爲臺柱，垂六載，盛譽勿稍衰。民八之冬，搭演丹桂，某夕，適該埠東海關監督特派交涉員警察廳長在座，觀渠與朱素雲戚豔冰（黃玉麟師）合演販馬記，孰料登臺時其行頭典質猶未及取贖，遂亟以班中陳舊襤褸之袍，遽爾穿着上塲。但戚朱兩伶所御服裝，鮮艶奪目，貴絕不引以爲恥！迨後諸要人方知其深嗜烟癖，隱密不宣，貧困異常，乃助三百金，囑令行頭悉數贖出焉。按俊卿藝事，實勝於王又宸，然始終鬱鬱不得志；而梨園諸前輩，則靡不欽敬其人，與時慧寳朱素雲情感尤篤，曾來滬三次，惜均未有如譚小培馬連良之紅也。</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十二章　盡如寗武可奈何</p>
<p>柳隱英遂和許靖結束訖，各携武器，走至庭中，牽過他們兩匹坐騎，出了寺門，大家跳上馬鞍。許靖常先，柳隱英在後，向寗武關飛馳而去。只見前面有許多難民扶老携幼，狼奔豕突的向這邊逃來。其中還雜有幾個兵士，滿面骯髒，徒手無械。許靖知道寗武關果然失守了。立即攔住一個，向他詢問。那兵士認得許靖的，遂將寗武失陷的經過吿訴給二人聽。原來周遇吉自許靖出戰以後，城牆一時沒有修葺完固，反不見許靖回城，料想凶多吉少，心裏非常懊惱，自誓必死於此。他立在陴邊，見流寇又如蜂屯蟻集般前來攻城。他盼咐部下儘將擂木滾石以及弓矢一齋向城下射放。果然寇不得逞，稍稍引退。但因流寇分作十隊，此去彼來，城上不得休息，士卒巳是異常疲乏。周遇吉和張烈親在城頭督戰，如有退後者斬。到了黃昏時候，周遇吉尙未進食。忽然一砲飛上城墻，把鼓樓轟毀了一角，明兵不免駭異。接連着一砲一砲的儘向關上放射過來。乃是李自成因吃了關上大砲的虧，聽了牛金星之言，亦派人到太原去運取據得的大砲數尊，以及砲手十數名來寗武相助攻城。今日恰巧大砲運到，便加入第一隊，安放了砲位，瞄準了城上開放，砲聲砰　不絕。周遇吉所有的砲却因火藥吿罄，不得施放，無法抵禦，祗得放箭。但砲火十分猛烈，城墻又未修竣，因此傾圮了一角，流寇便如潮水一般向着傾圮處衝進。一入城便四處放起火來。官兵大亂，人民紛紛逃竄，號哭之聲與喊殺之聲織成一片。此時此地眞不知是何世界！（一一八）</p>
<h3>金素琴表示退隱</h3>
<p>— 星</p>

<h3>喬治賴甫德　琵琶別彈</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉跟喬治賴甫德的羅曼史，曾經閧動影城，（見本月六日本刋）喬治在好萊塢向來是以受失戀痛苦次數最多的影星聞名，年前他和佛琴妮潘恩打得火熱，因爲喬治的前妻，不曾和他正式仳離，所以他們始終沒有結婚的可能。</p>
<p>後來一個時期中，喬治又跟瑙瑪希拉戀愛，看起來他們兩人的熱度已經高到一百度，在喬治的家裏，每一個房間都有瑙瑪的照片，甚至把她的幾種照片帶在身上；而瑙瑪的房間裹也放着喬治的照片，然而熱度終於像水銀柱般驟然降了下來，喬治跟瑙瑪好夢難圓而分手了，一塲恩愛又成泡影，這在兩人內心裏，自是有無限感慨和隱痛的。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉在銀幕上是一個雍容華貴的婦人，且有銀幕第一名媛這稱。至於喬治賴甫德，則是個鐵錚錚的漢子，性格冷靜，豪爽，在脾氣上兩人的確很難合得來。</p>
<p>現在喬治的新對象是好萊塢「最佳體態女星」蓓蒂葛蕾寶，蓓蒂以前本無盛名，自「紅花艷曲」，「仙藥街」二片而躍爲紅星，蓓蒂的性格坦白，天眞，和喬治很合得來，他們初次會面是在好萊塢一家夜總會裹。那時蓓蒂正在這家夜總會裏任事，次日他們還相約騎脚踏車去兜風，不久蓓蒂下嫁二十年前紅得發紫的童星賈克哥根，這期間她和喬治音訊不通，後來她和她的丈夫在一九三九年宣吿離異。</p>
<p>蓓蒂離婚不久，在派拉蒙公司與喬治相値，當時他們祇略爲寒暄了幾句，便握手道別，在喬治和瑙瑪分手後月餘的某天，蓓蒂忽在家接到喬治的電話約她出游，此後他們形影不離，在夜總會裏或是公共塲所都相偕同行，喬治送了她一個鑲金和珍珠的烟盒，又送了她一條金鋼鑽的項圈，表示愛戀之心。</p>
<p>喬治賴甫德琵琶別彈，棄「絕代艷后」瑙瑪希拉而戀蓓蒂蕾寳，這消息父閧動了影城，其結果正未可臆測呢！</p>

<h3>Recommendation of Prime Ministerial Candidate by Senior Japanese Statesmen; Konoe Organizes New Cabinet for the Third Time; List of New Cabinet Members Not Yet Announced; There is Talk that Shigemitsu May Succeed Matsuoka as Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th—The Emperor of Japan today ordered Konoe to organize a new cabinet. Konoe resigned with his entire cabinet yesterday but remained in office at the Emperor's command. He was summoned to the palace again this afternoon, and after a special meeting of senior statesmen held in the palace, the Emperor ordered Konoe to form a new cabinet. The Japanese news agency here claims that senior Japanese statesmen met in the palace this afternoon to decide on a prime ministerial candidate. Most of the senior statesmen were former prime ministers, including Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Marquis Kido, Privy Council President Dr. Hara, General Hayashi, Baron Wakatsuki, Admiral Okada, Admiral Yonai, General Abe, and Hirota. The Cabinet Advisory Council convened this morning at the Prime Minister's official residence, and all cabinet members submitted their resignations to Konoe. Key cabinet officials, such as Secretary-General Tomita, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Murase, and Lieutenant General Suzuki, head of the Planning Board, also submitted their resignations. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Yamaji, and the Vice Minister of Home Affairs, Kayaba, have also resigned, it is said.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th—After being ordered by the Emperor to form a new cabinet, Konoe requested the Emperor grant him time tonight to reorganize the cabinet. It is said that Konoe is now actively organizing the new cabinet. If this is successful, he will formally accept the Emperor's command to remain as Prime Minister. After being ordered by the Emperor to form a cabinet, Konoe had a consultation with the Minister of the Imperial Household.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th—At 6:25 PM today, after a forty-minute audience with Konoe, the whole country is still awaiting news of whether Konoe has accepted the imperial edict to form a new cabinet. It is rumored that Konoe did not return home directly after leaving the palace but visited Home Minister Hiranuma, which has aroused much speculation. It has been confirmed beforehand that after Konoe was summoned to the palace, he would be ordered to form a new cabinet. After returning to Tokyo from the Hayama Imperial Villa, the Emperor immediately summoned the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kido, because he was responsible for submitting the list of new cabinet members selected by the senior statesmen's meeting to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th—This afternoon, Konoe was summoned to the palace, and the Emperor ordered him to form a new cabinet. It is generally believed that Konoe will accept. The general public is pleased with this news, as many feared that an extremist like Admiral Suetsugu might be ordered to lead the new cabinet. Konoe left his residence at 4:15 PM and arrived at the Imperial Palace at 5:00 PM. The formation of the cabinet began immediately. The Emperor received him immediately, and later Konoe also consulted with the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kido, in another room for half an hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th—At 1:00 PM this afternoon, the Japanese Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kido, convened a special meeting of senior statesmen to decide on the new Prime Minister. The genro system seems to be reviving. The Cabinet Advisory Council held its last regular meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 11:00 AM this morning. After the meeting, the twelve cabinet members submitted their resignations to Konoe as usual. The cabinet's resignation was announced last night at 11:15 PM by Ito, director of the Information Bureau, as follows: "The current cabinet was ordered by imperial edict last summer. Since then, we have worked together to formulate and implement domestic and foreign policies. We deeply feel that it is urgently important to quickly complete and strengthen the internal structure, and most importantly, to strive to implement national policies at this time of uncertain global change. Due to the urgent need to implement thorough reforms to the cabinet's organization, we have decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Konoe has collected the resignations of his colleagues at a special cabinet meeting and went to the Hayama Imperial Villa at 9:00 PM to submit them to the Emperor. The Emperor expressed his condolences and instructed him to temporarily administer state affairs until a new Prime Minister is appointed. The Prime Minister has conveyed this to his colleagues."</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th—Foreign Minister Matsuoka's condition shows no signs of improvement and he remains at home. He summoned his family doctor for a consultation.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th—According to official reports this morning, Prime Minister Konoe requested the cabinet to resign because Japan should quickly strengthen its internal political structure. The cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday and submitted its resignation en masse, but it was not announced until late at night.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the League of Nations Issues Report Declaring Continued Work</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 17th—The 1941 report of League of Nations Secretary-General Lester declares that the League is currently carrying on its work. It stated that the League's personnel and budget have been greatly reduced and that a portion has been moved to Canada. The International Labour Organization has scaled back its scope but is still working in Geneva. The League of Nations Secretariat continues to provide governments with useful information on health, nutrition, housing, social assistance, youth protection, refugee assistance, and drug control. The report also expressed the view that politicians responsible after the war must restore international life structures to avoid the tragedy of war recurring.</p>
<h3>Main Reason for Cabinet Resignation Due to Sudden Changes in the International Situation</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th—Today's Japanese newspapers generally believe that Prime Minister Konoe's cabinet resigned to facilitate the government's rapid reorganization to unleash the country's maximum strength. It is generally believed that this is necessary for Japan to cope with the constantly changing world situation. The newspapers prominently reported that the Emperor shortened his summer vacation at the Hayama Villa due to the Emperor's extreme concern about the current situation. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the Konoe government has adopted the policies decided at the Imperial Conference on July 2nd to complete its plan to cope with the new situation after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Political observers are currently focusing on whether the highest policies, which have not yet been officially announced by the authorities, will be revised. Although this resignation is said to be due to the need to strengthen domestic institutions, the main concern of the government that continues in power is foreign policy.</p>
<h3>US Believes Konoe Cabinet Overthrow Related to Axis Pressure</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th—Last night, newspapers here printed brief news of the Japanese cabinet's resignation in large type. Observers are now studying the reasons for Konoe's cabinet's downfall, but the information received is very simple. Information from the East suggests that pressure from Berlin is likely related to the Japanese cabinet's overthrow. An official announcement stated, "Since its establishment last summer, the current cabinet has spared no effort in internal and external affairs. The government now feels that in order to effectively implement national policies, it is necessary to quickly strengthen the internal structure and reorganize it. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe requested the cabinet members to resign. The Emperor warmly praised Prime Minister Konoe and instructed him to temporarily remain in office pending further orders. Prime Minister Konoe then conveyed the Emperor's intention to all cabinet members." At the same time, Japanese newspapers in Tokyo predicted that the Soviet-German war would enter a "dangerous stage" in early September and claimed that "Japan must now take action." The newspapers also solemnly pointed out the need to resolve the "China" incident and accelerate the southward advance. Thai Minister to Japan, Sinatjara, met with Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials and French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, in the afternoon and extended the date of his summer vacation. According to the opinion of people here, Konoe's cabinet resigned because of the Soviet-German war and the unanimous demand from Japanese newspapers that the government should be extremely strengthened. Tokyo newspapers indicated that the new cabinet may be composed of prominent figures from the army and navy and will be a stronger cabinet. However, it is not yet known who will be selected for the new cabinet. It is generally believed that Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shigemitsu葵, will succeed Matsuoka as Foreign Minister. As for the prime ministerial candidate, it is believed that there are three promising army figures and one admiral: Governor-General of Korea, General Minami; General Nishio; Commander of the Korean Garrison, General Itagaki; and Admiral Suetsugu.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 17th—According to a Domei News Agency broadcast from Tokyo on the 17th, the meeting of senior statesmen ended at 1:58 PM today. Minister of the Imperial Household, Kido, will enter the palace to recommend the new cabinet candidate to the Emperor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th—Konoe had an audience with the Emperor at 5:10 PM today, but no announcement had been made by 5:30 PM. This morning, before Konoe got out of bed, his official residence was surrounded by officials, reporters, and the public. After Konoe got up at 11:00 AM, the first to be received was his former secretary, Mori Shige. An hour later, his two secretaries entered in succession, but they left shortly afterwards to announce the holding of a meeting of senior statesmen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Remain Silent on New Cabinet Members, Refraining from Speculation</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th—Tokyo's Japanese newspapers are not speculating on the new cabinet members today as much as they have in the past. This shows the strictness of the newly promulgated National Defense Security Law in controlling newspapers. The newspapers did not even mention who would succeed Konoe as Prime Minister, but well-informed sources said that they believed that the new government would implement a small cabinet system to make quick decisions on important issues. The Abe cabinet before the Yonai cabinet also tried to implement a small cabinet but was unsuccessful. However, Tokyo newspapers unanimously stated that the cabinet's resignation was to facilitate the government's thorough reorganization to develop the country's maximum strength, which is necessary for Japan to cope with the constantly changing world situation.</p>
<p>The saying that this is related to the key relationships is not without reason. If the Japanese cabinet is reorganized for this reason, then Germany's pressure on Japan to participate in the war only shows that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union has not progressed as smoothly as planned and that it wants Japan to stab the Soviet Union in the back. Some observers believe that the overthrow of the Konoe cabinet is a good omen because internal opinions in Japan are divided, and the northward or southward advance may not be realized in the short term. People here are now watching the nature of the new Japanese cabinet. It is generally believed that current Foreign Minister Matsuoka has the least hope of joining the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th—Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters that he had not yet received official information about the Japanese cabinet's resignation. State Department officials are unwilling to make any criticisms before receiving a detailed report. According to official circles, the Japanese conservative business faction seems to have forced the government controlled by the military clique to step down. If so, this is of great importance to the United States. It is heard that President Roosevelt expected a cabinet crisis in Japan long ago, so he avoided any serious conflicts with Japan in recent weeks, because the Japanese business community is more friendly to the United States and less willing to cooperate with the Axis powers. According to the opinion of some observers here, the firm policy of Britain and the United States in the Pacific is not without the power to overturn Japanese foreign policy, and the Anglo-Soviet friendship treaty has also put Japan in a difficult situation, so domestic sentiment is dissatisfied and the business community's hand may be strengthened as a result.</p>
<h3>If Pro-Axis Faction in Japan Gains Power, They May Advance South Recklessly</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th</p>
<p>The State Department refused to comment on the Japanese cabinet's resignation yesterday, but unofficial sources said that this was the result of a clash between two factions in Japan, one advocating active assistance to the Axis and the other advocating improving relations with Britain and the United States. It is not yet known here which faction will gain the new regime, but experts say that if the pro-Axis faction wins, figures like Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori白鳥, will likely become Foreign Minister. They also said that Shiratori's ilk will tear up the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty as a possible prelude to attacking Vladivostok. Japan may also advance south, especially occupying Cam Ranh Bay (in Vietnam). If the pro-British and American faction wins, Shigemitsu葵 may become Foreign Minister, at which time Japan's relationship with the Axis will ease. It is believed here that since the cabinet was overthrown by the radicals, once the new cabinet is formed, these radicals may take military action. Political circles here believe that the announcement of the laying of mines in Manila and Subic Bay indicates that the United States is prepared to deal with Japan's southward advance. It is believed that this is a precautionary measure to prevent Japan from attempting to block American troops in the Philippines when it is assisting Germany and facing difficulties in withdrawing from the Far East, while focusing its main force on advancing south to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Cam Ranh Bay.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Change of Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Just as the world was watching Japan's movements, the Konoe cabinet suddenly submitted its resignation en masse. Thus, this "New Order" cabinet, which had existed for exactly one year, collapsed with the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. In form, this is almost entirely a repeat of the fall of the Hiranuma cabinet.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese cabinet has changed five times, and partial reorganizations have been countless. Even in the one year of Konoe's return to power, there have been as many as seven changes, with the average lifespan of each cabinet being only ten months, and the political situation has rarely been stable for more than three months. This situation, even in peacetime, shows the extreme instability of the political situation. As for a country at war, it is almost impossible to find a similar precedent in history. From a one-sided observation of the political situation, it is not difficult to understand the difficulties and challenges that Japan is facing today.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Japanese cabinet this time was directly affected by the Soviet-German war. As for whether the radicals or the conservatives brought about the fall of the cabinet, it is not yet fully clear. Judging by intuition, although there has been much discussion in Japan recently, it is extremely noisy. The forces of the radical and conservative factions are almost evenly matched. Neither side has the absolute power to grasp the political situation. Therefore, rather than saying that the Japanese cabinet resigned because it was attacked, it is undoubtedly more accurate to say that Konoe and others felt that they could not hold on any longer and sought to leave. The outbreak of the Soviet-German war was indeed a necessary but very sudden event in the international political situation in recent years. All related countries were somewhat shocked when the news of the war first spread, especially Japan, which had treaty obligations to both the Soviet Union and Germany. Japan's ambition to expand its relationships internationally has almost always shifted based on whether it is beneficial to its expansion attempts. The Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact were both preceded by a long period of advocacy and deep consideration before difficulties were overcome on the basis of an absolutely favorable judgment. But by the time the treaties were concluded, the development of the international situation was completely contrary to what the Japanese authorities had initially estimated. Nazi Germany failed to occupy Britain within a few weeks, and the development of the European situation failed to prevent Britain and the United States from taking care of the Far East. What Japan gained from the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact was only mutually contradictory treaty obligations that were difficult to fulfill, and in the end, it fell into confusion and did not know what to do. This is indeed a major failure of Matsuoka's diplomacy, and it is also a major failure of the Konoe regime, because in fact, Matsuoka is no different from the soul of the Konoe cabinet. But this is not entirely Matsuoka's personal responsibility. The style of Matsuoka's diplomacy is a realistic opportunism based on the expansion demands of the radicals. He himself lacks opinions and vision and only wants to take advantage of favorable international opportunities to be clever. His failure is not surprising. But under this kind of situation, Japan's foreign policy cannot be too high-minded. Comparing Matsuoka to his predecessors, Arita and Nomura, it must be admitted that Matsuoka is versatile. His achievements in diplomacy have far exceeded those of his predecessors, but the result is only to trap himself in a dilemma. This situation is the fate caused by Japan's expansion policy and internal and external circumstances, which cannot be reversed by any effort or achievement on the branches.</p>
<p>When Konoe made his comeback last summer, he harbored a "New Political Structure Movement" plan and looked forward to "Showa Restoration." His aspirations were extraordinary, and his momentum was great, which was incomparable to previous Japanese cabinets. People, chastened by past experience, did not dare to have too high expectations for him, but they also hoped that after thoroughly reviewing current policies, he would be able to pull back from the brink and rescue Japan from its bottomless expansion attempt. But the result was not only that this expectation completely failed, but also that the "New Political Structure Movement," on which he relied as a means of calling for support, has repeatedly changed. In name, it has been reduced to "Imperial Rule Assistance," and its reform plan has been shelved due to attacks. After the 16th Diet this spring, it has even disappeared without a trace, and the term "Imperial Rule Assistance" is rarely mentioned. On the other hand, the established political parties have completely declared their dissolution, resulting in the Japanese political situation being neither democracy nor dictatorship. The relationship between the government and the people is almost dislocated. In terms of policy, it blindly followed the expansion desires of the military and Matsuoka's realistic diplomacy, and the inability to resolve the war against China formed a great distress, so that this good opportunity for the European war could not be developed in any way. The conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance only brought countless international pressures and resentment. Since this spring, it has been keen to ease relations with Britain and the United States, and recruited Ogura Masatsune into the cabinet to obtain the help of the zaibatsu and moderates for the cabinet. However, the Japanese cabinet itself was already terminally ill. Even without the great embarrassment caused by the Soviet-German war, the military and diplomatic distress had made it impossible for Konoe to continue.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese cabinet has collapsed, but Japan's current difficulties are by no means something that personnel changes alone can solve. The past four years have provided ample evidence of this. With Konoe's personal popularity and the prestige of the New Order Movement, his past achievements were only so. Moreover, there is currently no one better than Konoe. There is no shortage of prime ministerial candidates in the radical and conservative camps, but neither has the power to call on the whole country. Therefore, Konoe finally made a comeback. Although the cabinet lineup is still to be revealed, according to the reports this morning, Shigemitsu葵 has the highest voice for the position of Foreign Minister. If so, the conservatives have a slight advantage. But if Konoe's third cabinet is still indecisive and lacks great wisdom and courage, and does not radically change Japan's internal and external policies, then its future fate may not repeat its previous two failures.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Believe Japan May Take Another Adventurous Action</h3>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 17th—Newspapers here unanimously believe today that the Japanese cabinet's resignation is a harbinger of Japan taking another adventurous action in East Asia. This action may lead to Japan's downfall. Lu Jun Ji Guan Sao Tang Bao, and influential Da Gong Bao, said that whether Japan advances south or north, there is a danger of being attacked from the rear. Sao Tang Bao said, "The Soviet Union and the United States have decided to cooperate. Therefore, if Japan starts attacking Vladivostok or Chita, the US Navy will definitely harass Japan's rear in the Pacific, and the Chinese army will also launch a general counterattack. Japanese warlords disregard these factors and recklessly start their new adventurous action, which may lead to their downfall." Da Gong Bao said, "The United States and the Soviet Union have decided to take joint action in the South Pacific and North Pacific." The newspaper also said that Konoe's cabinet's resignation was only Japan's attempt to evade its obligations under the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. Da Gong Bao also predicted that if the new cabinet's Prime Minister is Korean Governor-General Minami Jiro or Korean Garrison Commander Itagaki Seishiro, then Japan will immediately join the war.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 17th—Zhongyang Ribao carried today that the Konoe cabinet had to resign due to internal and external pressure. Although the details of the cabinet's downfall are not yet known, it is believed that it is due to the following three reasons: (1) The recent resolution of the Imperial Conference has encountered strong opposition inside and outside the cabinet; (2) The new political structure has encountered various obstacles, especially the new economic structure; (3) The cabinet cannot formulate the budget for the next fiscal year due to financial difficulties. The article also said that since the start of the Soviet-German war, Japan's main supply line with the Axis powers has been closed, which has also increased the cabinet's difficulties. If the downfall of the Konoe cabinet is due to the opposition of the extreme right-wing, then it is daring to expect that the new cabinet will also suffer the same fate. Sao Tang Bao said that the Konoe cabinet was caused by the military's strong opposition to its policies, especially its foreign policy. Opposition leader Kuhara is now strongly advocating that Japan should join the German-Italian side in the war. Matsuoka's absence from the cabinet meeting before the cabinet's resignation shows that Japan's recent political turmoil is mostly due to differences of opinion on foreign policy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 17th—Well-informed Chinese sources here said that Konoe's reappointment as Prime Minister of the new cabinet was not unexpected, as the cabinet's downfall was due to the military's dissatisfaction with the policy of waiting and seeing decided at the recent Imperial Conference. Japan cannot attack north or advance south at present, and it must find a new Prime Minister who can get through the current period of indecision. Therefore, Konoe is the most logical choice.</p>
<h3>Radicals Forced Cabinet to Resign in Order to Implement Their Policies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th</p>
<p>A Reuters Far East expert said that after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Japan's future was uncertain. The Japanese government had different opinions on this issue. The radicals led by Foreign Minister Matsuoka and Army Minister Tojo were almost doing their best to advocate that Japan should take this opportunity to further expand into Vietnam. The Minister of Interior Hiranuma Kiichiro, known for his prudence, was recruited into the cabinet by Konoe last December in an attempt to slightly restrain the radicals, and he must advocate a policy of temporarily waiting to see how the European situation would develop. The Japanese business community, increasingly anxious about the tension in Japan's financial and economic position due to the war against China, naturally supported the moderates in the cabinet. The cause of the Japanese cabinet’s resignation is purely speculation at this time. What is probable is that the divergence of views between the two factions in the cabinet has reached a very serious point, so the radicals led by the army have forced the current cabinet to resign in order to reorganize the new government and implement their policies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 17th—Responsible people here declared that Malaya is now watching Japan's political situation with attentive eyes but without a sense of worry. No one can know what the future holds for Japanese domestic politics. The cabinet’s resignation may be the initial step to remove the burden of the policy in order to get a prelude for free actions, but it has absolutely no impact on Singapore's policy of making every effort to carry out all preparations. As one example, the recently issued announcement here prohibits any merchant ships from entering or anchoring in the territorial waters of the east coast of Johor, Pahang, Terengganu, and Kelantan, and the west coast of Johor between sunset and sunrise from now on.</p>
<h3>News of Japan's Imminent Large-Scale Invasion of Vietnam - Establishing Naval and Air Bases in Cam Ranh Bay with Vladivostok as the Secondary Target</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th – Responsible sources here yesterday believed that if Japan launches a large-scale invasion of French Indochina (Vietnam), the United States and Britain may respond by announcing a complete embargo on Japan and cutting off all Japanese imports. Reliable sources stated that there is an unparalleled crisis in the Pacific. Observers believe that within days, Japan will establish naval and air bases in southern Vietnam, regardless of Vichy's approval. Japan's primary immediate target is Cam Ranh Bay in southern Vietnam. Simultaneously, it is rumored that Führer Hitler has exerted immense pressure on Tokyo to launch a large-scale naval operation to blockade Vladivostok. Observers believe that after Japan seizes Vietnam, Vladivostok will become Japan's secondary target. However, they are hesitant to make a definitive judgment. It is rumored that London and Washington have frequently exchanged diplomatic opinions over the past few months, indicating a hardening attitude towards Japan. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt still hopes to avoid actions that could cause Japan to misunderstand within the limits of endurance, and to avoid a Pacific war that would divert strength from the European Atlantic War. However, if Japan acquires major naval and air bases in Vietnam, it will gain bases to seize Thailand, Singapore, Burma, India, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. According to Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, Japan still hopes to increase the quantity of gasoline, rubber, tin, and other goods imported from the Dutch East Indies. However, there is currently no indication that Japan's wishes will be satisfied. Commentators believe that Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies will impose an embargo on Japan to prevent it from engaging in war. Observers also stated that Vladivostok is becoming an absolute necessity because it has suddenly become the back door to the Soviet Union. Goods from around the world are being transported to the Soviet Union through Vladivostok. Observers expressed considerable doubt that the Soviet Union would refrain from strenuous retaliation if Japan were to blockade Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th – The "London Times" diplomatic correspondent reported yesterday that he had received private news from France that Japan has drafted its demands for Vietnam and will submit them to the Vichy cabinet within days. The correspondent stated, "Japan will clearly state that whether Vichy agrees or not, Japan will ultimately acquire bases in Vietnam." It was also stated that news constantly comes from Tokyo that Japan will either advance south or north in the near future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Adelaide, Australia, 17th</p>
<p>Japanese Minister to Australia, Tatsuo Kawai, told people here yesterday, that the rumor of Japan advancing south has spread widely, but in reality, the only advance I know is on the golf course. The question of whether Japan will advance south, endangering Australia, depends on the extent of provocation against Japan. Currently, it is only a needle prick." Kawai did not specify what he meant by a "needle prick."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th – Dutch sources here commented yesterday on the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet, saying, "If it means an attack on the Dutch East Indies is imminent, we are prepared."</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 17th – Yesterday, a government spokesman denied the London report that Japan would threaten war if France did not agree to Japan's demands on Vietnam. The spokesman also stated that relations between France and Japan are very friendly.</p>

The enthusiasm of the Canadian people can be seen in this.</p>
<h3>Pine Wood Successfully Refined into Diesel Fuel, Satisfactory Trial Use on Highway Vehicles - 19 Kilometers Per Gallon</h3>
<p>Yong'an – Professor Lin Yi of Fujian Private Union College, in view of the lack of liquid fuel sources after the war, has devoted himself to research and invented a method of refining substitute diesel fuel from pine tree roots. Last summer, he was commissioned by the Construction Department and the Provincial Institute of Industrial Research to establish a liquid fuel research institute in a certain place. After continuous experiments over the past year, the refining results have become increasingly satisfactory. The refined diesel fuel was recently tested by the Provincial Transportation Company on highway vehicles, traveling 400 kilometers and achieving 19 kilometers per gallon, and its performance even exceeded that of imported diesel fuel, especially when used in German-made triangular brand vehicles. The Provincial Transportation Company is now investing 400,000 yuan to set up a factory for refining, with an estimated monthly output of 20 metric tons and a cost of about seven yuan per gallon. Further large-scale refining will reduce production costs further. According to Professor Lin, after the successful refining of diesel fuel, lubricating oil and other products can also be produced, and he is currently continuing to research the refining of pure gasoline with considerable confidence. Wang Deyao, director of the Provincial Research Institute, stated that this invention is the first of its kind in the world and has not been announced before. It is a major contribution, especially today when maritime transport is interrupted and power raw materials are lacking. (16th)</p>

<h3>Poet Yang Yunshi</h3>
<p>— Da Chun</p>
<p>Poet Yang Qi, Yunshi, is praised by the world as a Jiangdong talent. According to a Hong Kong telegram, he suddenly died of illness in Hong Kong. Those who knew and did not know him, those who had read Yang's poems and articles, all lamented and shed tears for him. Yang was from Changshu. He was with General Wu Ziyu for many years, and his spirit was resolute. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Yang went to Hong Kong, leaving behind his poems and articles. He wrote the Jiangshan Wanli Lou Poetry Collection, which was widely circulated among scholars. His wife was Xia Ke, the eldest daughter of Li Jingfang, who died early.</p>
<p>His life was filled with literary talent and romance, unrestrained and uninhibited. In 1900, he stayed at the Qin family in Nanxiang. Qin had a daughter named Shan Yuan, who was virtuous, dignified, and devoted to Yang. Eventually, the sons of wealthy families vied to marry her, and the matter was not settled. The daughter also died depressed. Yunshi mourned her with a poem, which reads: "Orioles and swallows can still talk about the old days, I cannot bear to reread the love poems. The alliance of gold and the promise of hairpins have turned to dust, I piously grieve like Du Mu." "Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains have traces of tears, I return alone to write a requiem. There is a promise in the blue sky, but no basis in spring, I fly in my night dreams to find which door."</p>
<p>Later, he passed through Hankou and met Chen Meimei in the red dust. Because Chen resembled his deceased wife, he was quite fond of her. After parting, Yang wrote twelve Jueju poems, including "The strings are bleak, and tear stains are seen, a small banquet by the river with a prince, no news from Xunyang's eastward journey, a resolute farewell, the souls are broken." "Green willows and grass cover the ground, the cuckoo cries urgently, ten thousand miles of peach blossoms before the ferry, sent to the south of the Yangtze River and the west of the sea."</p>
<p>Yang once wrote a Yan Gui Lai Ci for his concubine Di Meimei, and many literati at home and abroad responded.</p>
<p>In 1925, a woman named Mou read Yang's poems and articles and admired his talent. She signed herself as Miss Fang Feifei Xie and sent a letter to Yang, willing to commit herself to his service. Yang politely declined. The letter was later found and published in newspapers, spreading throughout the country.</p>
<p>After the war, Yang immediately went south, worried about world affairs. He once wrote a Yang Liu Zhi Qu, with the line, "I break a willow branch to climb the riverbank, sending off guests to Tianjin every year, this year there is no one to send the guest, all turned into a heartbreaking journey." His feelings of leaving the country were vividly expressed on paper. There is also a poem, Remembering Changshu, which is also deeply emotional, which reads: "My hometown is the most beautiful in the world, every stone and handful of soil is not ordinary, searching for hills and valleys in the south is unsatisfactory, I miss Wu and Yue even more with a deep sigh. Recently, the border areas are full of happy scholars, a thought of home, clear tears hidden, I sigh that my old and weak strength is weak, I worry about climbing the peaks and valleys in front of me. The mountain spirit laughs at me for not going deep, holding trivial bones and jingling." This shows Yang's deep sentiments. Now, unfortunately, the heavens have taken away an elder, and he died in Hong Kong. In the coming years, Yang's brothers will forget to commemorate their mother, and Yang can rest in peace!</p>

<h3>Eastern European Broad Front: Soviet-German Forces in a War of Attrition; Combined Forces of Approximately Nine Million; Germans Claim Occupation of Smolensk</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Soviet and German forces engaged in constant offensives and counter-offensives along a broad front yesterday, advancing and retreating in a tug-of-war that continued throughout the day. The fiercest fighting occurred in the four districts of Biskov, Smolensk, Bobruisk, and Novograd-Volynsk, but no major changes resulted. Only in the north did the Germans claim to have advanced 30 miles and seized Novgorod (outside Lake Ilmen, 120 miles southeast of Leningrad). Moscow Radio reported that Soviet forces were continuously pushing back the Germans in the central sector, preventing them from crossing the Dnieper River. A large German tank unit retreating from Rogachev, west of the Dnieper, was reportedly encircled and annihilated by Soviet forces yesterday. As for the southern sector, there is no confirmation of reports that German tanks have entered the capital of Bessarabia. According to a Berlin dispatch in the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Berlin admits that German forces are encountering extremely fierce Soviet resistance and counter-attacks. This morning's Soviet communique stated that yesterday, the Soviet Air Force launched concentrated strikes against enemy motorized units and aircraft at airfields, and attacked enemy troops concentrated at crossing points, as well as bombing multiple convoys and oil tankers. When Soviet forces approached one airfield, eight German aircraft attempted to escape, but their engines malfunctioned and they were unable to take off because airfield personnel decided to surrender to the Soviets and sabotaged the engines to prevent German pilots from escaping. As a result, the Soviets captured 12 mechanics and 27 pilots. On July 15th, 100 bombers landed in Bessarabia and surrendered to the Soviets, with the pilots claiming they were unwilling to fight for fascist Germany. The German tank unit retreating from Rogachev, which was encircled and annihilated by Soviet forces, included six tanks whose drivers were so exhausted that they could not get out of the vehicles without assistance. An examination of the prisoners revealed that they were physically weak due to poor nutrition and overexertion.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - The Soviet Union mentioned the fighting in the Smolensk region for the first time today. It is generally believed that German forces may have made considerable progress in that area, but the German claim that they have occupied the city of Smolensk has not been confirmed by any other source. (Note: Smolensk is an important railway hub on the Dnieper River, approximately 200 miles northeast of Minsk and approximately 250 miles from Moscow.)</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 17th - The center of the Soviet-German war has shifted to the northern sector of the Baltic front. In the areas of Biskov and Pokrov, fighting continues on the Dnieper River after the Soviet recapture of Rogachev and Zlobin three days ago. It is claimed that the Soviet offensive has not diminished in the slightest. Foreign observers say that the Soviets are very confident in the war, as the German advance has been greatly reduced compared to the initial offensive in Western Ukraine. The slowed pace of the Soviet evacuation of women and children from major cities also demonstrates Soviet calmness. There is no confirmation here regarding transportation disruptions.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 17th - This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet supreme military authorities are conscripting reserve troops as much as possible in hopes of blocking the German offensive. We estimate that the total number of troops on the Eastern European battlefield is approximately nine million, which can be described as an unprecedentedly large war in history. The southern wing of the German-Romanian allied forces has occupied Kishinev, the capital of Bessarabia.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 17th - The Dan Bos newspaper reported yesterday that since the start of the war, the Soviet Union's first-line troops of 170 divisions have lost 50 divisions. Among them, 30 divisions were completely eliminated in the major battles of Brest-Litovsk and Minsk within Polish territory. Another 20 divisions were heavily hit and retreated from the front lines, undergoing replenishment. The report also estimates that there are approximately 20 Soviet divisions fighting against German and Finnish forces in Finland and Murmansk, approximately 100 Soviet divisions on the Stalin Line, approximately 100 divisions being replenished, and another 150 cavalry and infantry divisions. However, these 150 divisions cannot be deployed to the front lines for the time being due to transportation difficulties. The German, Finnish, Romanian, and Hungarian forces fighting against the 370 Red Army divisions number approximately 225 divisions.</p>
<h3>Soviet War Reports</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - The Soviet Information Bureau released the following war report for the 17th: "Last night, fierce fighting continued in the Biskov-Pokrov area. There were no major battles in other areas, and no changes in our troop positions. Our air force heavily bombed enemy tanks and mechanized units."</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - The Soviet Information Bureau announced the evening war report for the 16th, stating that during the day, fierce fighting continued in the areas of Biskov, Smolensk, Bobruisk, and Novograd-Volynsk. Our air force is concentrating its efforts on destroying enemy mechanized and motorized units. Enemy airfields, pontoon bridges, and transport and oil ships at Prusti, Surin, Dulsi, and Yinshaksi were also heavily bombed by our air force.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th - The Soviet Information Bureau announced the war report for the 16th, stating that during the night, fighting continued in the Biskov-Pokrov, Polotsk, and Vitebsk areas. There were no major battles or significant changes in the positions of troops in other areas. Our air force continued to attack enemy mechanized and motorized units and bombed the Prusti oil fields, causing a major fire.</p>
<p>TASS, Battlefield Report, 17th - A Pravda reporter provided details of the Battle of Rogachev, stating: "The Soviet cities of Rogachev and Zlobin were recaptured by our forces two days ago. The Soviet flag is once again flying over the city. The city was completely destroyed by the fascist barbarians. The Battle of Rogachev unfolded as follows: After Soviet troops were forced to retreat to the east bank of the Dnieper River, they adopted an offensive posture. For several days, the fascists repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but were met with strong resistance from our troops. On July 13th, after Soviet troops received reinforcements, they immediately launched an attack from that position. Our troops crossed the Dnieper River via pontoon bridges and engaged the enemy in a life-or-death struggle, driving them out of Rogachev. Soviet artillery assisted the infantry in combat, silencing enemy artillery fire. 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed and countless wounded. Our army captured a large number of prisoners. Fighting continues west of Rogachev."</p>
<h3>German Communiques</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th - This morning's German official communique stated that German forces have now occupied Smolensk, a railway junction and the central hub of the Eastern European war in recent days.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 17th - It was announced here today that as German forces advance towards Leningrad, Soviet forces are retreating east of Biskov, towards Pokhov and Novgorod, and are reportedly retreating to an area south of Leningrad. They are being increasingly isolated from the western border due to relentless German aerial bombardment and are attempting to establish new defense lines along railways and other transportation routes. "Since Sara was captured by German and Finnish forces, Murmansk is reportedly in danger of falling. Sara is only 50 miles west of Kandalaksha, located on the White Sea's northwestern tip, and is on the railway to Murmansk." The communique also stated that on the southern front, German armored divisions have shattered fierce Soviet counter-attacks and are advancing rapidly eastward beyond Kyiv. Kyiv is currently under siege. Berlin Radio admitted today to the "courage and strength" of the Soviet counter-attacks but claimed that German forces continued to advance, pushing deeper into the Soviet hinterland beyond the remnants of the Stalin Line. "Important developments are maturing."</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 17th - Officials here announced that German forces are aggressively advancing toward Kyiv, having reached a point east of Kyiv. The German advance followed intense shelling by Soviet artillery. Military sources acknowledged that the German assault on Leningrad would face strong resistance when the encirclement of the city began. It was also learned here that German forces "shattered" Soviet forces during their advance on Kyiv. Over the past two days, German forces captured hundreds of small fortifications. These small fortifications were extremely well camouflaged and could only be identified when they opened fire. German assault troops extensively used liquid fire weapons and hand grenades during their attack on Kyiv. Officials also reported that a Soviet supply unit southwest of Leningrad was completely annihilated. The German pincer movement is advancing from Biskov and Vitebsk, encircling Smolensk in preparation for a major offensive. German strategy involves coordinating blitzkrieg tactics along the entire front with Finnish and other allied forces, keeping Soviet forces constantly on the run and unsure of when the next attack will come.</p>
<h3>Soviet Order Reorganizes Political Propaganda Apparatus; Military Departments Established in Each Division; Political Officers Participate in Military Activities</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued the following order regarding the reorganization of the political propaganda apparatus and the establishment of military departments in each division: "The war that has been forced upon us has greatly changed the working system of the Red Army. Due to the war, our political work has greatly increased. Therefore, political personnel must not only make efforts in propaganda but also bear the responsibility for frontline war activities. On the other hand, the war has made the work of division commanders even more complicated. Therefore, political personnel should assist them not only in political work but also in military activities." In view of the above, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in accordance with the wishes of the State Defense Committee, has decided as follows: (1) All political propaganda organs and parts shall be reorganized into political organs and parts of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army; (2) Military commissar departments shall be established in each division, headquarters, military academy, and Red Army organ, and political instructor departments shall be established in each company and unit; (3) The regulations for the establishment of military commissar departments in each division of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army are approved.</p>
<h3>Germany Has Repeated a Tragic War; Deputy Director of Soviet Intelligence Bureau Claims Hitler Will Surely Be Annihilated</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - Deputy Director of the Soviet Intelligence Bureau, Lozovsky, stated to foreign reporters on the 15th that the most important result of the Soviet-British political and military agreement signed on July 12th is that Germany will inevitably fall into a two-front or multi-front war. German political and military leaders have always been extremely afraid of multi-front wars. He then recalled the statements made by German Minister of War representatives at a press conference in February, stating: "From 1914 to 1918, Germany's two-front war was a tragic war." Lozovsky continued, stating that all German authorities in the past believed that German victory depended on avoiding "two-front warfare." However, the recent Hitlerian military experts and non-military scientists advocate that the only way out for the German military is to wage war against the Soviet Union and Britain, that is, a two-front or multi-front war. This is madness, not a good strategy. Germany has received the two-front war it fears most. The battle lines of Hitler and his followers extend from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from northern Norway and the British Isles to Spain, then through the Mediterranean Sea, Abyssinia, Libya, and other former Italian colonies, through the Atlantic Ocean to British territories, and as far as Australia. Hitler is confronting the entire globe. In Europe, all patriotic and culture-loving people have formed an anti-Hitler front. Not only that, but the people of China, the United States, India, and all freedom-loving peoples hate Hitler. Hitler's initiation of multi-front warfare, even if his military equipment is perfect, will inevitably begin to falter. His war against the entire population of the Soviet Union and the Red Army will inevitably only falter. Hitler initially attacked Britain and suffered defeat. Now, he is gathering to attack us again, but on this front, Hitler will suffer an even greater defeat. Hitler willingly risked two-front warfare while still comforting the German people with talk of one-front warfare. After the signing of the Soviet-British agreement, German radio still claimed, "The world can now see that Germany is not fighting a two-front war." This further demonstrates the ugliness of Hitler and his followers.</p>
<h3>Göring's Mystery Will Soon Be Revealed</h3>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 17th - Well-informed Nazi sources claim that they cannot disclose anything about Göring's current whereabouts, but they speculate that Göring will soon appear in an official capacity. Foreign news, especially that broadcast by Moscow Radio, widely claims that Göring has refused to take responsibility for leading the German Air Force in the war against the Soviet Union because the Air Force is still seeking to be fully prepared. Therefore, a conflict has arisen between Göring and Hitler.</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Refuse to Transfer, Serious Disturbances Occur</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - In Greece, serious disturbances occurred in one Italian division due to their refusal to transfer to the Turkish border. Similar incidents have occurred among other Italian soldiers being transferred to the Turkish border.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Drop Large Amounts of Bombs, Severely Damaging German Industrial Areas; Ships Discovered in Rotterdam, British Command Sends Aircraft to Bomb</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - London official sources: From June 16th to July 10th, British Air Force fighters dropped approximately 2,000 tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the Ruhr area, which is extremely important to Germany. During the same period, British aircraft dropped over 500 tons of bombs on Bremen and approximately 1,000 tons of bombs on Cologne. This is one example of the British Air Force intensifying its bombing of Germany, causing extensive damage to its heavy industry and railway transportation. It is reported that the British Air Force will continue this offensive. On Tuesday night, they attacked the Ruhr again. The bombs hit factories and caused large fires. Duisburg was also severely damaged in the bombing. That night, the port of Messina in Sicily, Italy, was attacked for the fifth time, with flames illuminating the sky. In addition, the communique also stated that British aircraft heavily attacked German airfields and destroyed an 8,000-ton enemy ship off the coast of Tripolitania. Another enemy ship was hit by a bomb. Six German dive bombers and one fighter attempting to attack British ships were shot down. Only two British aircraft were lost in the action.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Recent British aerial reconnaissance discovered a large number of enemy ships concentrated in Rotterdam. The bombing command then dispatched Blenheim aircraft to bomb the area yesterday afternoon. British aircraft arrived in two waves. Residents waved to them to show their welcome.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th - A squadron of British aircraft attempted to attack the Dutch city of Rotterdam yesterday afternoon. Using low cloud cover, they dropped several bombs in Dutch territory, but caused little damage. Three British aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - An Air Ministry communique stated that a small number of enemy aircraft flew over eastern and southeastern England last night and dropped bombs in several locations, causing little serious damage and few casualties. The British Air Force attacked northwestern Germany again last night.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Several enemy aircraft flew to the coast of England yesterday, but none penetrated inland. As of 6:00 PM, no reports of bomb drops had been received. One enemy bomber was shot down by British aircraft off the south coast yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Yesterday's Middle East communique stated that on the 14th, British heavy bombers heavily attacked enemy airfields in Greece and Crete, hitting hangars and runways, causing large fires. Enemy aircraft flew over the Suez Canal area last night, and two were shot down.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Production Greatly Increased; Will Eliminate German Advantage; Enable Britain to Seize Air Supremacy</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 17th - The Aviation Industry Chamber of Commerce released the 1941 Aviation Yearbook today, stating that in the coming months, U.S. aircraft will eliminate Germany's aerial advantage and enable Britain to seize air supremacy. The combined production of Britain and the United States will have a decisive force to shift the war's trend in the coming months. The increase in U.S. aircraft production under the U.S. defense program is a miracle recognized by knowledgeable people and can be the main factor in resolving the evil conflict between democratic countries and totalitarian countries. According to the current program, the United States can produce 18,005 aircraft in 1941 and 30,000 in 1942. Since the start of the war, the United States has delivered a total of 3,500 warplanes to Britain.</p>
<h3>Beirut Entire City Joyful; British and Australian Troops Officially Enter City; Deng Zi Leaves Syria, Returns to France to Report; Before Leaving, He Could Not Help but Burst into Tears</h3>
<p>Reuters, Beirut, 17th - Reuters correspondent in the British Army in Syria: When the British Imperial Army entered Beirut, the French expatriates gave an astonishing welcome. Arabs and Syrians also gathered on the sides of the road and on the roofs to welcome the troops into the city. Cheers and applause were incessant, and an atmosphere of joy permeated the entire city. Leading the way was a large unit of Australian troops, whose band played military music. Machine gun units, trucks, and infantry followed into the city, their steps neat and their military appearance grand. They gathered in the city center square, and the people also flocked to the scene, lifting several Australian soldiers onto their shoulders. Some also took their instruments and played dance music. At noon on Thursday, Generals Wilson, Catroux, and Le Gentilhomme will lead the British Imperial Army infantry, cavalry, armored vehicles, and other units to formally enter the city. Special Commissioner Deng Zi, who was stationed in Syria, said goodbye to the troops on Sunday and has set off for Tripoli with his staff. Deng was unable to control himself and burst into tears during the farewell. The inside secrets of the Syrian tragedy will gradually be revealed afterward. When the Vichy army and the British army were engaged in fierce fighting, they treated Syrian prisoners and detained British expatriates extremely well. A Reuters interviewer stationed in Tripoli, who was detained in Kisruwan, Lebanon, stated, "We received excellent treatment and were allowed to listen to the latest communiques broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation every night." Undoubtedly, the Syrians and French expatriates are quite pleased that the British army has entered Syria, freeing them from the threat of the Axis powers. A curfew will be implemented at 8:00 PM tonight. Notices have been posted throughout the city, warning the public that anyone who endangers the security of the British Imperial Army will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>United Press, Beirut, 17th - British Army leader in Egypt Wilson and Free French Army leader in Syria Catroux received the administrative authority of Beirut from General Gouraud at the Grand Sérail Palace at 11:50 this morning in the simplest ceremony. The main force of the British army entered the city at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 17th - Turkish Radio reported that General Deng Zi boarded a ship in Beirut yesterday to go to France to report to Pétain on the signing of the armistice agreement. At the same time, French official sources stated that after the withdrawal of the French army, the British army had completed its military occupation. The British army decided to advance northward and gradually occupied Homs and Tripoli and will occupy Latakia and Aleppo this weekend. British patrols are now defending the entire French oil pipeline from Boukmayl through Palmyra to Homs and Tripoli.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 16th - Political figures here recently stated that the British-French armistice agreement stipulates that "all military and civilians may choose between joining the Allied forces or being repatriated to their hometowns." This provision was imposed by the British on the representatives of the French High Commissioner to Syria, General Deng Zi. Therefore, the attitude of the French government towards those who join foreign countries or join the traitorous de Gaulle faction remains unchanged.</p>

<h3>Russian Analysis of the Far East Situation: Japan is Likely to Seize Vietnam to Consolidate its South Pacific Stronghold; Currently, it Will Not Risk a Northern Advance</h3>
<p>A Russian-language newspaper in this city commented yesterday on Japan's future movements, believing that before the collapse of Soviet power, the Japanese will first consolidate their southward advance bases in Vietnam and Thailand and will not advance north for the time being. The argument is very insightful. The original text is translated below: "While celebrating the Anglo-Soviet agreement, the world is also paying attention to the development of the Far East situation, and the problems in the western Pacific, in particular, are of concern to the general diplomatic and journalistic circles, which is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Japan is Still Waiting for an Opportunity</p>
<p>What actions Japan will take in the future is what we urgently need to understand. According to Japanese newspapers and official statements, Japan currently seems to be adopting a policy of "vigilant waiting for an opportunity," and will not take any sudden action. However, what is the real intention? There is no clue to be found at present. This is because the words recorded in Japanese newspapers mostly quote arguments from various countries around the world on this issue.</p>
<p>Vietnam is Likely to Become a Stepping Stone for the Southward Advance</p>
<p>Judging from the process of past events, the Japanese will first consolidate their southward advance bases in Vietnam and Thailand. Today, there have been repeated reports of the Japanese confiscating American goods in Vietnam and Hainan Island. This is enough to prove that when the Japanese carry out their aggressive policies, they do not forget to strengthen their control in the area. Vietnam has almost become a stepping stone for Japan's southward advance, as it is as easy as taking something out of a bag for them to attack Thailand from there, because the Japanese have long had deep-rooted foundations in Thailand.</p>
<p>A Risky Northern Advance is Not Yet Timely</p>
<p>However, this does not mean to deny that the Japanese dare not advance north. We only say that the Japanese will definitely not advance north at present. Because Japan is occupied with matters in China, it is not easy to jump out of this predicament for a while, and they have long been eager to try in the South Seas. Now, if they want to change course, shift their troops north, what will be the consequences? It is really difficult to predict. Therefore, we believe that the Japanese will definitely strengthen their political power in the South China Sea and consolidate their base in Vietnam before risking a northern advance and fantasizing about gaining a foothold in the Maritime Province. However, since the Anglo-Soviet agreement has just been signed, the international situation has changed, and there seems to be no favorable aspect to this risky action.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are Determined to Help the Soviet Union Fight</p>
<p>If Japan were to advance north and invade the Soviet Union, the United States would not sit idly by either, and would definitely provide support to the Soviet Union. Some say that the United States will tacitly agree to Japan's northern advance, so as to eliminate the threat from Japan to its own country. I really dare not agree with this view. Everyone knows that Britain and the United States are incompatible with communism, but as long as the great enemy Hitler is still tyrannical in the world, it can be asserted that the two countries will definitely help the Soviet Union fight.</p>
<p>Deliberately Being Cunning Makes People Confused</p>
<p>The reason why the Japanese dare not launch a northern advance at present is that they want to wait for the end of the Soviet-German war to be revealed. Unfortunately, this cannot be predicted in the short term. It is true that the Germans have penetrated deep into Soviet territory, but they cannot boast of victory. Even from the Japanese side's observation, they know that in the German-Soviet war, the Germans will not be able to make the Soviet Union surrender. If so, then it is very obvious that the Japanese do not need to wait for the outcome of this war. Judging from the Japanese psychological aspect, the Japanese are accustomed to deliberately confusing their intentions, making people confused and unable to distinguish their movements.</p>
<p>The Key Lies in the Decisive Battle Between the Soviet Union and Germany</p>
<p>If we comprehensively analyze the information from all parties regarding the Pacific, it should be as follows: Japan is determined to advance south in order to accelerate its actions, so it intends to occupy Vietnam and build naval and air force bases there, so as to strike a blow when the United States launches an offensive in the Pacific in the future. If the United States actively supports Britain in the Western Front, Japan will not be restrained by the United States in the East. Therefore, after consolidating its base in the South China Sea, it can rashly attempt a northern advance. However, the launch of this event must have another fact as its prerequisite, that is, the Soviet Union loses its resistance to the German army, and also feels difficult to deal with the Japanese army's actions. If so, the Japanese will dare to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>There is No Need to be Pessimistic About the Future Situation</p>
<p>If the future development of the international situation is unfortunately like this, people of insight should not think so, because the Japanese are unclear about the results of the European war, the situation in the German occupied areas, and the relationship between the United States and Britain. Before these are clarified, Japan will not dare to take military risks in the north. The world situation is changing rapidly. Japan, like Britain, the United States, Germany, and the Soviet Union, is carefully considering matters and has to carefully consider its policy decisions. However, no matter what changes there are in Japan's national policy, Japan will engage in more extensive acts of aggression in the future, this is what we dare to assert.</p>
<h3>Sale of the Citibank Building: Clarifying the Reasons; Avoiding the Purchase of Real Estate is a Consistent Policy</h3>
<p>The authorities of Citibank in this city clarified the reasons for the announcement of the sale of the building at No. 41 Jiujiang Road the other day as follows: "Our bank has always adhered to the principle of trying to avoid the purchase of real estate and making every effort to lease offices for the 141 branches in New York City and various locations. In order to implement this policy, we sold the Jiujiang Road building to China Land Company at a high price the other day. According to the contract, our bank still retains the right to lease the real estate there for a long time, and both parties agreed that the buyer will invest in building a new modern building there for our bank to use."</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Sailing to England Have Been Subjected to Restrictions</h3>
<p>In order to prevent materials from flowing into the Axis countries such as Germany and Italy, democratic countries have adopted strict measures to inspect the ships and cargo of various countries. It is reported that the United States has implemented a ship guarantee system for ships sailing in the Panama Canal and Suez Canal areas. The United Kingdom must also apply to the British authorities for a naval navigation license in advance for sailing on the entire sea surface of Europe. This method has now gradually expanded to the Near East Sea. The first to be affected is Japan. According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's four ships, the Africa Maru, Hawaii Maru, Nini Maru, and Tō Maru, which were originally scheduled to go to the gates, have also changed their routes due to the British restrictions. It is said that the inspection procedures at Cape Town are extremely complicated. Each ship must have a guarantee. The quantity of fuel and supplies purchased when the ship is docked is also decreasing day by day. Moreover, due to the slowness of the cargo handling procedures, the sailing days cannot be fixed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Officer Stationed in China: Obara Succeeds</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun", the Japanese Ministry of Finance recently decided at the cabinet meeting on the 15th of this month to transfer Kinouchi Shiro, the financial officer stationed in China, to the director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in order to reform its internal structure. Kinouchi is scheduled to take the Kami Maru to Japan on the 24th to take office. As for his vacancy, the Japanese side has decided to appoint Obara Masaki, the current director of the Tokyo Monopoly Bureau, as his successor.</p>
<h3>Two Commemorative Days are Approaching: Preparing for Preventive Measures; Inviting Merchants to Undertake 20,000 Sandbags; to Strengthen the Border Defense Equipment</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the security and tranquility of the Public Concession, the Public Concession Bureau of Works implements semi-blockade precautions on the neighboring sections (such as piling up barbed wire, building fortresses and sandbags), and a large number of detectives are stationed to protect it. The entire security of the Concession relies on this to be consolidated. Now, because all the sandbags were prepared during the Shanghai War, after many years, the outer hemp bags are about to rot. For this reason, a public announcement was made yesterday, inviting merchants to undertake sandbags, a total of 20,000 to be tendered, with a deadline of August 1st. It is heard that after these sandbags are delivered in the future, in addition to replacing some old and rotten ones, the rest will be used to expand the defense equipment on the border. Since the commemorative days of the Songhu War and the Mukden Incident are approaching, defense is being actively strengthened.</p>
<h3>American Action Fundraising Week Raised More Than One Million US Dollars; The Results Will Be Better When it Ends at the End of the Month; Medical Supplies for China Will Arrive in Shanghai Within a Week</h3>
<p>The United American Relief to China (UARC) was established on April 1, 1941, by uniting the United China Relief, the China Emergency Relief Committee, the China Aid Council, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the American Committee for Chinese War Orphans, the Christian China Relief Committee, and the American Committee for Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. The association, in view of China's resistance to aggression for independence and freedom, with sympathy and admiration, will provide practical relief to China, enable China to join the ranks of rejuvenation, and lay the foundation for world peace.</p>
<p>The United Fund Ends at the End of this Month</p>
<p>The United Relief to China Fund has been launched from April 1 to July 31 of this year to raise US$5 million in relief funds for China. Its closing date is at the end of this month. According to a report by the chairman of the association, Bryan (Chairman of the Board of Directors of Marine Midland Trust Company and Chairman of the Congress), the donations directly received by the general association and branch associations were 518,611.85 yuan during the "Action Fundraising" week last month. The other six groups participating in the fundraising campaign, such as the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, received 490,293.25 yuan. John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated US$50,000 alone. Various districts in Pennsylvania once donated US$20,000 alone. An anonymous person in New York donated US$500 alone. The association is scheduled to end temporarily at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Donations Exceeded One Million Last Month</p>
<p>According to Bryan's report, the total amount obtained during the "Action Fundraising Week" last month was 1,005,905.00 yuan, and the donations received this month are not included. According to American shipping news, the China United Relief Association is currently stepping up its publicity efforts. With the joint appeal of the seven groups, it will definitely be able to obtain the generous donations of the American public and rise up in response. The general American public has a sense of shame and guilt, and the general mood of aiding China is becoming increasingly boiling. Therefore, according to Bryan's statement, raising US$5 million is only a matter of time. He also said that there will be good news to report to you before the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Fundraising is to Revitalize China</p>
<p>According to Dong Qingnianhui, the general director of the association, the purpose of this expanded fundraising campaign is to enable the participating groups to obtain the following points for the rear of China: (1) To continue and expand medical treatment assistance; (2) To assist China in establishing 30,000 industrial cooperatives to revitalize China's industry and increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people during and after the war; (3) To assist Chinese colleges and universities that have withdrawn to the rear to continue their cultural research efforts; (4) To relieve Chinese refugees who have suffered from the war. In short, it is to reduce the suffering of the 450 million Chinese people and help China lay the foundation for its construction and revitalization.</p>
<p>Part of the Relief Supplies Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China alone donated 1.6 million yuan, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total of 5 million yuan. All donations were used to purchase medical supplies to aid China, which will be transported to western China via the Burma Road and entrusted to the American Red Cross for handling. It is reported that the American Red Cross will rush to transport medical supplies worth US$1 million to China, loaded on the first ship exported from the United States and transported to China via Rangoon. However, according to this Red Cross news, Shanghai will ship medical supplies, including cracked wheat, etc., worth US$50,000 to Shanghai before the 20th of this month, which will be shipped directly from Seattle, along with 3,000 pounds of milk powder, in Sheng glass bottles, with a total of 80,000 bottles. Clean and hygienic, even the cracked wheat that is shipped is packed in white cloth bags, each bag weighing 50 pounds. This American wheat is made with high-quality rice milling machines, and even national rice is inferior to it. The Araiva, which arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month (with a deadweight of 6,961 tons), also carried part of the American wheat to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Wheel: Machinery Handling</h3>
<p>The British Taikoo ship Guangdong was detained by the Japanese army on the 10th of this month due to the problem of carrying machinery and is still berthed at the Jünpu Wharf. One hundred and fifty coolies have now unloaded the machinery carried on the ship to the shore for Japanese inspection. According to news from the Japanese army, the machinery was started to be unloaded on Tuesday and slowed down due to rain. So far, 800 tons of groceries loaded on top of the machinery and 80 tons of machinery have been unloaded, accounting for the majority of the total. The unloading work will be completed soon. Once the machinery is unloaded, 800 tons of groceries will be reloaded on the ship, and the Guangdong is scheduled to sail south on the 19th. However, the machinery will still be detained at Wusongkou pending investigation. According to the original plan, the Guangdong was scheduled to go to Yangkou last Thursday, carrying 500 boxes of machinery consigned by Anli Yangxing to the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese side pointed out that this machinery was transported to the interior and was detained.</p>
<h3>Three Western Police Officers Resign: Colleagues at the Police Station Bid Farewell</h3>
<p>Recently, many Western police officers of the Public Concession Police Department have been approved to resign, including Trainee Patrol Leader Brower, Thames, Roberts, and other three people. Colleagues from the department held a banquet at the Chengdu Road Police Station yesterday afternoon to bid farewell, and presented commemorative items such as silver shields and cigarette cases to commemorate their departure. It is found that Bro and others joined the service in 1938. Thames served at the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Roberts served at the Gordon Road Police Station. After leaving their posts, they will all leave Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>French Tram and Automobile Company Also Intends to Request a Price Increase</h3>
<p>The English "North China Daily News" said that according to people from the British Public Omnibus Company and Tram Company, the number of passengers has suddenly decreased after the price increase of the two types of public vehicles a few days ago. However, the statement that the number of passengers has decreased by 40% is an exaggeration. It is normal for there to be fewer passengers after the price increase, and it is expected to return to normal soon. At the same time, it is heard that the French Tram and Electric Light Company, which operates trams and public vehicles in the French Concession, also intends to ask the French Municipal Council to approve another increase in the fare of public vehicles. According to an official, the company is still discussing this matter and has not yet made a definite decision.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Average Price List</h3>
<p>The following list is the average price on Wednesday, July 16, and from June 16 to July 15. This price list is newly compiled by the Statistics Section of the Public Concession Industrial and Social Affairs Department for employers to adjust employee allowances.</p>
<h3>Female Employees Save Makeup Expenses to Help Students: Ms. Zhou Qunyan Encourages Women to Rise Up; Xinhua Hardware Store Donates Spare Money; "Shen Bao" Outlying Readers Respond to Student Aid Fund</h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao" Reader's Student Aid Fund yesterday was the sixth day of micro-fundraising. According to the accounting group, more than 800 yuan was received in one day, which is a big increase compared with the results of previous days. Readers from outlying areas also enthusiastically responded and remitted money to help students. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Highest Donation Record</p>
<p>The names of the donors yesterday are as follows: Yu Rongzeng of Xinhua Hardware Store, 200 yuan; Ms. Zhou Qunyan, 200 yuan; Old Lady Sun, 100 yuan; Wang Taotao of HSBC Woolen Cloth, 100 yuan; Zhou Shouzhi, 100 yuan; Ying Yongyu, 65 yuan (list omitted); Chen Baoming's sister, 20 yuan; Xu Gongda, 16.25 yuan; Haimen County Post Office, 10.064 yuan; Shao Xianxun, 10 yuan; Gao, 10 yuan; Ying Yongyu sent 10 yuan as a wedding gift for Mr. Qian Xinzhi's son, Qian Ting; Wang Ranzhi, 10 yuan; Li Mingsheng, 5 yuan; a total of 856.89 yuan. Adding the previous total, it is 3,477.07 yuan.</p>
<p>Outlying Readers Respond Positively</p>
<p>Wang Zitong, Tao Fa, and other 11 colleagues from the Haimen Post Office took the lead, which is admirable. The letter said, "I recently read in your newspaper that you are calling for help for the disaster-stricken children Ni, Bao, and Wu, which is very admirable. And the children are determined to make progress and fight against the environment, just like those who uphold justice against aggressors. Our colleagues at the Bureau each donated one yuan to help the disaster-stricken children. Although the amount is small, if everyone does the same, it will also add up."</p>
<p>"Shen Bao" Reader's Group Aid Fund</p>
<p>Mr. Ying Yongyu advocated the "Group Aid Fund" for readers of this newspaper, that is, hoping that the vast readers of "Shen Bao" would each contribute one yuan, then it would not be difficult to raise tens of thousands of yuan. This work is to help outstanding poor and out-of-school students and cultivate cadres and talents for the country. Its contribution is very great. Mr. Ying also advocated "Wedding Gift Aid," such as weddings and birthday celebrations, etc., where the wedding gift can be used as a student aid fund, which can achieve both goals.</p>
<p>Stores Propose Donating Leftover Money to Help Students</p>
<p>Yu Zengrong from Xinhua Hardware Store on Henan Road said in a letter, "Our store deeply admires your newspaper's enthusiasm for service. Since Ni and Bao called for help in the newspaper, followed by the student aid fund movement, the enthusiasm of all walks of life has been jumping on the newspaper. Our store respectfully allocated 200 yuan from the leftover money first, and will donate again after accumulating a certain amount. In recent years, the business of industrial and commercial companies in Shanghai has mostly developed. If we follow Mr. Yu's method and allocate leftover money to help poor scholars, the amount must be very considerable. I hope that people with good intentions will work hard to promote it."</p>
<p>Female Employees Save Makeup Expenses</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Qunyan from Robert Sun Road sent a long letter yesterday, expressing her high views, saying, "...I am one of the loyal readers of "Shen Bao". When I was young, my family was poor, and I dropped out of school after graduating from elementary school. Now I work in a light bulb company and can barely make a living, but I often feel that my knowledge is insufficient and deeply hate the pain of dropping out of school in my childhood. Therefore, I have deep sympathy for your newspaper's righteous deeds and respectfully transfer my makeup expenses (200 yuan) to serve as a student aid fund to fulfill the responsibility of a member of the country. I hope that the rich wives and ladies in Shanghai will rise up in response, and the number will be very considerable..." Ms. Zhou's enthusiasm and perseverance are very inspiring.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Xu Gongda from the General Bank uses book remuneration to help students, and Mr. Yangzijiang and Jiang Xinliang transfer the稿費所得 of本報自由談·春秋·游藝界·to充作助學金, Shao Xianxun, a student at Datong University, saves expenses and transfers資助學, and Card Road Li Mingsheng and Xiao Liyou agree with yesterday's Yellow Xiaoshi Xiao Yiyou to donate糖菓費等, all have very good opinions,词长省略。</p>
<h3>Robbery of Rice Trucks Rampant on Remote Roads</h3>
<p>Rice Trucks Add Magnetic Marks</p>
<p>Since the price of rice soared, the trend of poor people gathering to rob rice has continued to occur. However, after the strict protection of rice store operations by the authorities of the two concessions, the trend of robbing rice stores has decreased, and instead, rice trucks are robbed on remote roads, causing disputes over responsibility between rice stores and rice trucks. More generally, vehicles outside the industry masquerade as rice trucks to contract operations. Afterwards, both the vehicle and the goods are lost, and the rice store suffers heavy losses. In order to prevent vehicles outside the industry from making trouble, rice truck operators all add magnetic marks to their rice trucks. They also notified rice industry firms that if vehicles without rice truck marks are found in the future, do not let them load goods to avoid the loss of both the vehicle and the goods. On the one hand, they notified the industry to install license plates on all vehicles on time to avoid vehicles outside the industry from disrupting operations and endangering the livelihoods of the industry.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps Will Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The Post Office announced that the commemorative stamps for saving construction funds will be sold at the stamp sales office on the third floor, No. 10 of this administration. These stamps can only be sold to stamp collectors and cannot be affixed to mail as a payment for postage. If it is found that this type of stamp is affixed to mail, the original will be returned to the sender. However, if stamp collectors apply for the Post Office to stamp the stamps, the Stamp Sales Office of this Bureau can do so.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Incident on Bailinan Road Yesterday Morning: Qin Jie Shot Three Times; Ambushed While Sitting in a Rickshaw; The Murderer Was Acquainted With Him and It Seems Like a Vendetta</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a shooting ambush incident occurred near Bai Lainan Road, Yidingpan Road, Shanghai West. The assassinated person was Qin Jie, who was shot three times. The reporters of the News Agency learned about the details of the case as follows:</p>
<p>Qin Jie, a native of Nantong, also known as Renjie, 32 years old, lives at No. 3, Baile Village, Bai Lainan Road, Shanghai West. He is currently the chairman of the General Company of Hesheng Land and Water Wharf Transportation Loading and Unloading Care Service Co., Ltd., No. 1, Lianshengli, Baile Commercial Field, Jing'an Temple. It is also heard that he has a part-time job elsewhere. At about 9 am yesterday morning, Qin, wearing a suit and leather shoes, went out from his home to go to work by rickshaw.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he was ambushed on the way. When the rickshaw passed the intersection of Zili Nan Road and Yidingpan Road, four men suddenly jumped out from the roadside. One man blocked the rickshaw's way, and the other three men stood on three sides and fired a shot at Qin, hitting Qin's back and left and right shoulders. Blood flowed like a waterfall. The shooters dispersed in a rush and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Although Qin was shot at the time, he was extremely conscious and urgently asked the rickshaw to pull him back home. Later, he called another car to take him to the Second Allied Hospital for treatment. It is heard that his life is not in danger. However, according to another source, Qin, in addition to serving in the above-mentioned position, also serves as an inspector. Among the murderers in this assassination, it was found that one of the murderers was his colleague Zhang's apprentice, Little Suzhou.</p>
<p>It was later found that Zhang and Little Suzhou and Wang were arrested, and there were still some in the escape未获. The cause of the bloodshed was entirely due to personal feud relations and结寃. It is learned that Qin was transferred to another hospital for treatment yesterday afternoon. After the incident, the Public Concession ambulance drove to救護, and因秦已自投醫院,故仍空车返归.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Was Robbed</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that American sailor Stan Conn was returning to his residence in Shanghai East by rickshaw at 1:10 am yesterday (16th). When he passed near Dong Bai Lao Hui Road and Hua Ji Road, Stan was half asleep. Suddenly, 15 bandits rushed out from the roadside, one of whom was holding a kitchen knife, and ordered Stan to get out of the car, robbed him of a gold chain and medal, and 15 US dollars, and then fled in all directions. Stan was outnumbered and did not resist. He watched the bandits flee. It is reported that last week, an American sailor was also robbed by 10 bandits in the area. The police believe that the two cases were committed by the same gang.</p>
<h3>A Pharmacy on Fuzhou Road Was Robbed: Two Thieves Were Arrested After Failing</h3>
<p>At around 7 pm last night, two thieves suddenly came to Dagon Pharmacy at No. 474 Fuzhou Road. One of them broke in with a pistol. At that time, a shop assistant managed to sneak out and report to the nearby岗捕. By this time, the police station had also received the news and dispatched armed detectives to surround and arrest them. As a result, both thieves were arrested and a fake pistol was found. The pharmacy did not suffer any losses.</p>
<h3>Refugee Association Relocates Refugees with Lung Disease</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently relocated the refugees with lung disease who were living in the former site of the Second Hospital on Hongqiao Road to Dunxin Road. Because the refugees mistakenly believed rumors, they refused to move and sent letters to various circles to appeal. After receiving the letter, Wen Lanting, a member of the Affairs Committee of the association, went to inquire about the reason. The association authorities replied that because lung disease requires long-term recuperation, there are not many beds in the First Hospital, and it is feared that it will affect other refugees. Therefore, it was temporarily rented from the former site of the Second Hospital on Hongqiao Road for settlement for nine months. Now, because the French Public Hospital has been established there, it should be moved. For the sake of the lives of dozens of refugees with lung disease, an empty shed that is relatively far away was vacated in the First Shelter, surrounded by bamboo walls to avoid infection. The area is for long-term recuperation for refugees with lung disease. According to the instructions of the Western official of the Sanitation Department of the Public Concession, the floor is laid in the shed to avoid moisture, and skylights are opened to increase air circulation, and more medicines are prepared, and the original doctors and nurses in the shelter are in charge of daily diagnosis and treatment. The Association has done its best for the refugees with lung disease and feels very regrettable that the compatriots do not understand this intention and lightly believe in people's words.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Weather Leads to Catastrophic Decline in Watermelon Sales</h3>
<p>Watermelon Vendors Left Between Tears and Laughter</p>
<p>Watermelon is a wonderful product for relieving summer heat. Taking this port as an example, the sales volume of watermelons in the summer is estimated to be over one million yuan, a truly astonishing figure. Even in the year with the lowest sales, the volume was around one million yuan. This year, the first watermelons transported to Shanghai were the "San Zhuang" watermelons from Suzhou. Just as the weather became extremely hot the previous week, prices soared, exceeding previous records. It was said that each load, weighing two and a half "dan" on the market scale, sold for over one hundred yuan. Upon arrival in Shanghai, various vendors eagerly purchased them in bulk, and they were quickly sold out. As the weather was hot, sales were easy, and those who acted quickly profited handsomely. However, when the second and third batches of "Pillow" watermelons from Hai Ning arrived the previous week, though they were excellent products, the sudden change in weather caused prices to plummet. Before long, they dropped to over eighty yuan. Later, due to continuous rain and a sudden cold snap, prices were repeatedly reduced, falling to over forty yuan. Retail prices dropped to over thirty yuan per "dan," then to over twenty yuan. Excellent seasonal products suffered a catastrophic decline in sales due to the change in weather, with supply exceeding demand. Some were lucky, some were not. Generally, most watermelon vendors lost more than half their investment, leaving them in a state of being between tears and laughter.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from Various Circles</h3>
<p>Wonderful Product for Summer Heat Relief: The Hangzhou Store at the intersection of North Shaanxi Road and Nanjing Road in this port is famous in society for specializing in selecting and transporting well-known local products from Hangzhou. The store's Hangzhou West Lake Genuine Lotus Root Powder, which has been sold for a long time, is especially popular. Genuine Lotus Root Powder has the effect of replenishing blood and strengthening the body, promoting saliva production, and stimulating the appetite. Men, women, the old, and the young all regard it as a regular and precious product in all seasons. Consuming the store's Genuine Lotus Root Powder during the hot summer season can relieve烦躁 and clear the mind, aid digestion, and avoid the disadvantages of dryness and greasiness common in ordinary foods. It is truly a sacred product for relieving summer heat.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement for Gift of Medicine: This newspaper acknowledges with thanks the receipt of two large boxes of Guanyin Emergency Pills and Wolong Pills, etc., sent by the Cai Tong De Tang Chinese Medicine Store yesterday.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The Shandong area will be cloudy to sunny, with localized fog and gentle southeasterly winds. This area and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island will change from cloudy to overcast, with occasional fog and gentle easterly winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was not recorded, and the lowest was 66.2. On the same day last year, the highest was 91.6, and the lowest was 81.3.</p>
<h3>Case of Western Policeman Being Shot: Russian Newspaper Attaches Great Importance, Published on Front Page Before War News, Loyal to Duty, Hated by Someone</h3>
<p>Xuemei Qiu, a Russian "Erdaotou" (second-class) policeman No. 112 from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station of the Public Concession, was suddenly shot while patrolling Mai Bian Road on Dahua Road at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. After being taken to Hong En Hospital, although surgery was performed, he died of his injuries at 6:37 PM that evening. The Soviet community has paid close attention to this news. Yesterday, the Russian daily newspaper published this news on the first page, in the first article, before news of the Red Army's counter-offensive victory. According to the newspaper, after Xue was sent to the hospital, the doctor indicated that there was very little hope of survival and did everything possible to save him. After fifteen minutes, his heart was extremely weak and after the surgery, his condition worsened. Blood was transfused, but before it could be completed, Xue lost consciousness and died. He has a sister in Shanghai who works at the "D.D." cafe, a brother who is currently serving in the Russian team, and his mother is in Harbin and came to Shanghai to visit him a few days ago. As for the reason Xue was shot, police officers said that Xue was very loyal to his duty during his lifetime and strictly enforced inspection work at the junction of western Shanghai, which may have caused him to be hated by someone. The police are paying close attention to the case and dispatched personnel to the shooting site yesterday to investigate the situation at the time.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Far East Situation is brewing, Chinese Foreign Debt is frequently rising, Domestic Debt is Slightly Declining due to Bullish Outbreaks</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market continued to decline yesterday. Amid the selling spree of "Xinhua" on the 16th, "Yu Da" and others also divested at any time, making it impossible for the bulls to recover the market price. Category C bonds even broke through the two-yuan mark, reaching a low price of one yuan and one jiao. It seems that continued volatility will leave little hope before interest payments. Yesterday morning, only "Xin Fu," "Run De," and "Run Li" bought in, while "Xinhua," "Yi Tai," and "Xie Kang" sold out. Because "Xinhua" was selling in large quantities, the two-yuan mark for Category C bonds was broken again. In the afternoon, "Yi Tai," "Xie Xing," "Yuan Xin," "Chang Yi," and "Yu Xing" bought in, while "Xinhua" continued to sell, with the volume still large. "Yu Da" continued to divest, and "Yu Ru," "Tong Kang," "Ding Kang," and "De Fu" all made outbreaks. "Yi Ji" also sold out. Category C bonds saw a low price of one yuan and one jiao, with the trend repeatedly fluctuating. Although the bulls bought in bravely, the market sentiment still failed to improve. It may not be easy to boost the market before receiving interest. As a result, except for Category D bonds, which intentionally raised prices and rebounded by four jiao, the rest all rebounded by small amounts, ranging from four and a half jiao to six and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was about 2.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Sincere Company were traded at a price of eleven yuan and five jiao.</p>
<p>The public stock market opened low. After opening, the high price was fleeting, and selling quickly intensified. The prices of various stocks trended lower, and although there were small rebounds from time to time, they ultimately could not be sustained and closed near the lowest price. Rubber stocks were softly neutral.</p>

<h3>Finance: Unprecedented Selling Spree by Japanese Banks, Extreme Imbalance Between Supply and Demand of Foreign Exchange, Speculators Also Switching from Buying to Selling, HSBC Increasingly Buying In the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchange rates were unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates was showing signs of weakening again, due to the unprecedented selling pressure from banks the day before and the speculative dealers' cover selling. After the morning opening, Chinese banks first showed willingness to supply, continuing the weakening trend from the previous day. Moreover, speculators still bought in at first, causing the US dollar to harden to 5.375 yuan, before slightly retreating to 5.34375 yuan. Japanese banks, such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, then came to dump aggressively, and rumors spread that the Japanese Tojo cabinet was about to be formed and would advance southwards. Chinese merchants switched to selling, and although foreign banks such as J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan absorbed the supply, the weakening trend intensified at noon. In the afternoon, amid the dual selling pressure from Japanese banks and speculators, and with further rumors of US-Japan conflict, even a rate of 5.4375 yuan per US dollar was difficult to sell off. The British pound hardened to 3 3/16 shillings and 28125 pence. But at 3:15 PM, both because HSBC was still absorbing large amounts and because rumors of bullish news emerged, the US dollar alone softened slightly. In the end, the gap between the British and US exchange rates remained large, and trading became increasingly active.</p>
<p>The Weakening Trend of the Foreign Exchange Market is Particularly Strong</p>
<p>Since the morning, there has been no change in the exchange rate for British, American and Indian currencies in the foreign telegram silver market. The exchange rate between the UK and the US is also flat. The central listing price has not changed. At the opening of the domestic market in the morning, the bank's selling price was 3 3/16 shillings and 234375 pence for British currency and 5.3125 yuan for US dollars. It immediately tended to harden. HSBC, a British bank, absorbed only a small amount of US dollars for July at 5.34375 yuan, followed by a slight absorption. Chinese banks all showed a willingness to supply, and the situation continued to weaken. HSBC's listing price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was still slightly 23.75 percent. Speculators continued to profit without end, and when the market softened to 5.34375 yuan, the Japanese banks began a fierce round of dumping. Chinese merchants also stopped buying and instead sold, and the Japanese banks were all competing to sell US dollars for July and August at 5.375 yuan. J.P. Morgan, McCalle and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. all absorbed the supply. At noon, absorption of the supply suddenly faded, so the noon closing price for British currency hardened to 3 3/16 shillings and 265625 pence, and 5.375 yuan for US dollars was still available for closing.</p>
<p>The Slackening has Ceased and there is Slight Recovery in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Although HSBC’s absorption of the supply was strong in the afternoon, Japanese banks fiercely dumped spot and July dollars, while speculators sold vigorously for August delivery. The price further slackened from 5.40625 yuan to 5.4375 yuan, and at the lowest point, it was possible to close a deal at the above price. However, at 3:15 pm, speculators suddenly stopped selling because HSBC had stopped absorbing so fiercely and because there was a bullish rumor, suddenly the slackening stopped and there was a recovery. The closing price at three and a half o'clock was 3 3/16 shillings and 28125 pence for spot to August delivery, and 5.4025 yuan for US dollars, which was 0.046875 yuan higher than the noon closing price of the previous day, and the U.S. long 0.09375 yuan. It is feared that it will be difficult to close a deal at the above price after closing.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Cabinet Resigns, Gold Prices Plummet Miserably, Lowest Near 400 Yuan Mark, Transaction Volume Reached 100,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the red-hot grey market for gold expanded its decline, with prices approaching the 6,400 yuan mark. Everyone was feeling weak and soft, because Japanese Prime Minister Konoe resigned and will be replaced by an aggressive young military cabinet, actively advancing southward. Moreover, since the foreign exchange market had been dumped on an unprecedented scale by Japanese commercial banks, Chinese merchants and speculators also switched to dump fiercely, and the market trend was extremely slack. Securities brokers in the arena added to the pressure and began dumping, and exchange brokers followed suit, so the price on that day fell from 6,495 yuan step by step. In the afternoon, the decline became even steeper, to 2,415 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the last fifteen minutes, a rumor of bullish news suddenly arose, and gold trading firms aggressively bought in. Although there was a counter-reaction and rebound, the closing price still continued to tighten by 80 yuan. After closing, the price rebounded to 6,470 yuan, and finally 6,455 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was about 100,000 taels. For the swap (July to August), sellers paid 57 yuan to buyers, and Yongcheng paid Xianghe 50 taels in cash, with the price 420 yuan higher than the forward delivery. In the afternoon, this was increased, with the price reaching 470 yuan higher, with demand and no supply, a rebound of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The morning listing price for decorative gold was 5 yuan lower, and did not rebound later.</p>
<p>The Forward Price Tightened by 80 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the market price opened at 6,480 yuan for each bar (ten taels) at 9:15 AM, which was 38 yuan lower than the opening price. The price then rose slightly to 6,490 yuan. Deda, Hesheng, and Defu all came to dump, and the price immediately fell to 6,473 yuan. When word came that the US dollar had softened to 5.34375 yuan, Xianghe, Chengji, Xinfengyong came to absorb the supply, and the price was pushed up by more than 20 yuan, rising to 6,495 yuan. Then the securities brokers dumped the gold at around 6,480 yuan, and it hovered for a long time. Until after 10:45 AM, a rumor of bearish news suddenly arose, and Yida, Defu, Yifeng, and Mingfeng sold even more vigorously, and the price immediately retreated sharply to 6,460 yuan. Litae bought in more than 4,000 taels, rising to 6,470 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,469 yuan. The afternoon opened at 6,460 yuan, and then retail investors bought in, raising the price from 55 yuan to 67 yuan. The foreign exchange market slackened, and sellers came out in droves. Yida, Defu, Meifeng, Xinfengyong, and Rencheng Yonglai aggressively sold off, and the price dropped by more than 50 yuan, falling to 6,415 yuan. In just an instant, a rumor of bullish news suddenly arose, and the foreign exchange market stopped slackening and suddenly rebounded. Deda, Hesheng, Xinfeng, Yong, Hengji, and retail investors poured in, pushing the price up to 6,440 yuan. At the 3:30 PM bull market closing, the price was 6,438 yuan, a tightening of 80 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The closing price for August delivery was 6,441 yuan and 6.2 cents, calculated at 5.40625 yuan per US dollar, which is equivalent to a discount of 3 yuan and 6.2 cents. After closing, Xinfengyong and Litae aggressively bought in again, and continued to push the price up to 6,467-8 yuan, then retreated back to the final price of 6,455 yuan. The whole day had a difference of 80 yuan. The selling price of the wood card gold in the cash gold shop was 480 yuan higher than the red-hot gold price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for cash, and no price.</p>
<h3>Decorative Gold is Also Listed at 5 Yuan Lower</h3>
<p>The exchange price per tael of jewelry gold in silverware shops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, was 710 yuan at 9:30 (40 yuan lower for buying).</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai for Six Months, Sufficient to Meet the People's Food Needs with Surplus, 380,000 Bags Arrived Last Month, Rice Market Still Small Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the daily investigations and disclosures by this newspaper, the foreign rice imported in the past six months has been sufficient to meet the food needs of the people of this city, and there is a surplus. A total of 387,537 bags of foreign rice arrived in port in June, of which 112,000 bags were directly shipped from Saigon, 128,492 bags were directly shipped from Yangon, and 41,000 bags of foreign rice were also shipped from Java. The remaining 100,645 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, all of which are the cheap small broken rice sold by the Public Works Department. No rice was shipped from Siam last month. It is learned that some will be shipped this month (Zu).</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was fairly stable, but it still saw a price drop of a few jiao to nearly a yuan compared to the previous day. This is because the inventory is increasing daily and arrivals are endless. Recently, small broken rice from Hong Kong and broken rice from Vietnam are being supplied in large quantities and at flat prices to the public sales in this street, and people can't help but feel soft, so after a flat market in the morning, the market then weakened. After falling, it also triggered opportunistic small-scale absorption, and the market returned to its position. However, there is more supply than demand, and people are still weak. A large batch of new broken rice has arrived, and the spot price has already fallen to 106 yuan, and the forward price is 108 yuan to 107 yuan and a half. Siamese No. 2 rice is 140 yuan to 140 yuan and 8 jiao, and the current price of small grain is 147 yuan, with the forward price at 149 yuan and 8 jiao to 148 yuan and 5 jiao. The total daily turnover was nearly a thousand tons. The spot price opened at 12,300 bags, with small grain falling from 120 yuan and 5 jiao to 119 yuan, then 118 yuan. No. 1 was 128 yuan and 126 yuan, No. 2 was 116 yuan and a half, and broken rice was 92 yuan and a half, then 90 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship, directly from Siam, carrying 13,931 bags of foreign rice, arrived at Pudong the day before yesterday (the 16th) and is scheduled to move to the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession tomorrow to unload. The Jiangsu ship arrived yesterday morning and also carried foreign rice. The exact number will be ascertained and reported later (Zu).</p>
<p>Due to the limited arrival of thin and thick japonica national rice, and the weather has turned overcast and cool, it is easier to maintain the price. The cargo owners are quite firm in their intention to sell, so although the sales market is still flat, there is no change in the market, and it only presents a situation of stability with fatigue. The opening price for fresh early and late indica rice from South Port is 141 yuan to 139 yuan, and the price from Central Port is 137 yuan. The price for Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice is 1334 yuan, and the price for aged japonica rice is 130 yuan.</p>
<p>In the midst of the sluggish foreign rice market, the path for glutinous rice continues to slacken. Whether it is domestic or foreign glutinous rice, the markets continue to follow suit with fatigue. It is estimated that the price for Hong Kong Gao Bai Yuan is 123 yuan and a half, the price from Central Port is 120 yuan, and then 118 yuan. The price for glutinous green bean is 1134 yuan, and the price for Golden Pill White Yuan is 1223 yuan, then 120 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales are Improving, Yarn is Still Hovering, The Swap Has Been Posted By The Bulls, Two and a Half to Five Horns Per Package</h3>
<p>The yarn market is up and down, but the actual transaction has been active. The Cantonese helped buy 650 packages of 10-count coarse yarn, 700 packages of 23-count and 20-count yarn, for a total of about 1,300 packages. 725 pieces need to be shipped out today, and the industry's thinking is still very firm. However, outsiders are pessimistic about the yarn market due to the resignation of the Japanese cabinet and the decline in benchmark gold, so they are selling more aggressively, but most of them are snatching hat properties. In the market, the swap is posted by the bulls at two and a half to five jiao. The high price for 20 count Double Horse is 1,588 yuan, and the low price is 1,569 yuan. The first price in the afternoon was 1,582 yuan, and it fell to 1,572 yuan. The final price is still 1,583 yuan. It is feared that there will be a period of fluctuation in the current yarn market, so that it will go back and forth at high levels, making it difficult for people to grasp. Also, some people observe that if the single price of the Double Horse factory cannot break through 600 yuan, the low peak may be seen below 1,550 yuan. This is a kind of saying, which speculators often have.</p>
<p>Double Horse Nongkai, because it was reported that the Japanese cabinet had resigned, speculative sellers were active, and the market was weak. The first price was 1,584 yuan, but only shouts were heard, the situation was weak, and it fell straight to 1,569 yuan. Then the profit-takers bought back, and the big players still bought in, and the momentum turned up, rebounding to 1,586 yuan. However, the securities gang and the gold gang were all tired of seeing the market and threw it out from time to time, and the pressure was heavy, and it softened again to 1,576 yuan. Then it was heard that there were more than a thousand packages in spot sales, rising to 1,588 yuan. By the time the closing price was 1,580 yuan, the amount of volume purchased by the gang had been listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>The Morning Market of the Gold Double Horse Forward Yarn, because of the rumors of peace, caused uneasiness among the parties, and the group turned to selling, and the July period fell sharply by 12 yuan, and the price was a low price of 1,425 yuan. The August period was not moved, and the September period followed a small four yuan and a half. After opening, it was suddenly heard that US cotton had plummeted, and the sellers were even stronger. The August period was as small as 1,446 yuan, and the September period was as small as 1,509 yuan. After entering the market, it was suddenly heard that the Hong Kong gang was purchasing a large amount of coarse and fine yarn, and that the July yarn would be stopped for auction in an instant. The shorts who were short of goods to pay off had to make up for it in advance, and the price gradually rose. Other months are still extremely gentle. The noon closing in July was slightly down 2 yuan, August was down 7 yuan, and September was down 11 yuan. The difference between the near and distant periods was 76 yuan and a half. 8,830 packages were traded. In the after-market, August was as small as 1,437 yuan, and September was as small as 1,506 yuan. The market price was tired first and then firm. As a result, the July period fell 7 yuan from the previous day, and the August and September periods fell 6 yuan each. A total of 15,530 packages were traded for the whole day, an increase of 3,470 packages from the previous day. The opening and closing high and low prices for the whole day are recorded on the left, (is the net market price)</p>
<p>Market Notice: July yarn will be made until the morning of the 19th, (is Saturday), and the October yarn will be added to the auction on the 21st.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Has Reported a Decline, Cotton Market is Still Firm</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still very firm, but US cotton has eased slightly, and the foreign exchange has lengthened, causing people to feel ordinary. However, the coarse fluff cotton situation is still high, and the transaction is not as complicated as in the past.</p>
<p>Another message is that the Shanghai foreign cotton orders are trading, and the market is flat, because the yarn market is circuitous and not progressing, and the general spot traders are not very enthusiastic. At the same time, foreign merchants and yarn factories are also reducing their intention to purchase long-term US and Indian cotton. Yesterday, in addition to the factory importing 800 packages of Brazilian cotton, flower dealers only traded more than 400 packages.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose because the cotton production and harvest situation was not good, but then fell back due to reactive selling and long liquidation. As a result, the closing price was 20 to 29 pounds lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sundries: Sugar and North-South Goods Compilation</h3>
<p>Coarse White is Slightly Loose Yesterday the sugar market was flat at first and then loose, with a slight decline. According to the Dutch telegraph, coarse white in September is US$6.00, and Dutch red is US$5.10, both C.T.F.KG. examples. The association's market allocation of spot 24 group white is a small number of corners, ranging from 996 yuan to 95 yuan for imports in June, 95 yuan and 1 jiao to 94 yuan and 7 jiao, 4 jiao and a half in May, 96 yuan and 9 jiao, 6 jiao, 4 jiao for the July 30 ticket, and 96 yuan for July 20. Dutch red KD Mark 76 yuan and 4 jiao, 7 jiao, NT Mark 74 yuan, Dutch cotton white high goods 111 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai B Mark new goods 117 yuan and a half, 1 yuan less, old goods 115 yuan to 14 yuan and 2 jiao, HX Mark new goods 94 yuan and 2 jiao, this factory 15 yuan to 14 yuan and 2 jiao, HX Mark new goods 94 yuan and 2 jiao, the city's number one ice seen is 124 yuan, and Jingming ice is 126 yuan.</p>
<p>Xianglian Rose Another 20 Yuan The cold air cargo from Benhu Lotus has risen to 360 yuan, and then called 400 yuan. Yesterday, the actual price sold was 380 yuan, another rise of 20 yuan.</p>

<h3>National Middle Schools Increase Classes: Ministry of Education Stipulates Unified Setup, Annual Expenses Will Be Distributed According to Standards</h3>
<p>(Emphasis on Chongqing-Hangzhou News) Since the war, middle school students in various places have lost their schooling due to the impact of the war. In view of the importance of secondary education, the Ministry of Education has set up 14 national middle schools in Chongqing, Sichuan, Gansu, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi and other places. It is learned that the Ministry of Education believes that the national middle schools in the past failed to strictly enroll students, resulting in an increase in the number of grades and insufficient funds. In order to save consumption and improve the level of students, it is hereby stipulated that each should set up grades after the beginning of the autumn semester of this year, respectively, so as to arrange and set up them in a unified manner, and allocate annual expenses according to the following standards based on the expenses of each school in the past, most of which were consumed on staff salaries and public affairs, and failed to purchase equipment that should have been added. (1) Salary expenses account for 70% of the total expenses; (2) Office expenses shall not exceed 20%; (3) Special fees for academic research and purchase shall not be less than 10%. It is hoped that the equipment of each school and class will become more perfect day by day, and in order to understand the equipment of each instrument and library, each school is specially ordered to report to the Ministry for investigation. Regarding the management and teaching of each school, the Ministry of Education also gave instructions and issued a notice to each school to intensify teaching, management and training. If a teacher is absent from class for any reason, he must ask for leave in advance and make up for the class afterwards, or ask someone to act as an agent. As for the principal and grade director who leave the school on official business, they must first obtain approval before leaving the school.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Will Move School Next Semester</h3>
<p>(Yong'an 17th Electric) National Jinan University has always been the highest institution for overseas Chinese children to return to China to study. Since the August 13th Incident, the school has remained on the isolated island and continued to offer classes. The school's graduates, Malaysian overseas Chinese Li Guangqian, Hu Qun, Hua Baoren, Zhou Guojun, Huang Guangrao, Li Sixin, etc., more than 3,000 people, were concerned about the glorious history of their alma mater, and called for a quick move to the rear to resume classes. 5,000 students from other Nanyang provinces also unanimously urged and especially requested Wu Tiecheng to inspect Nanyang. During the inspection, the 8,000 alumni discussed this wish with Wu Tiecheng and conveyed it to the Central Government, and the overseas Chinese students were willing to take responsibility for raising funds for the relocation and equipment. Wu Tiecheng expressed his deep approval and promised to convey it to the Central Government. At the same time, domestic Jinan University students also responded one after another. The Fujian Provincial Committee, led by Qiu Hanping, joined forces with Fujian students to actively request the Ministry of Education. When Gu Yuxiu, Vice Minister of Education, arrived in Fujian for inspection last month, Hu Chuyu, a representative of the Malaysian Jinan University students, was in Fujian and stated this intention to Gu face to face. Gu also expressed complete acceptance. According to news from overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Education has made some decisions on the relocation of Jinan University, roughly from the next semester, it can be moved to the rear and continue to offer classes.</p>

<h3>Talking about the "Shen Bao Scholarship"</h3>
<p>— Jian Song</p>
<p>Please everyone work hard to help, it is our unavoidable duty!</p>
<p>Relieving the extremely poor is also among the "virtues" in China. However, people often do not investigate the causes of poverty and the social roots of why there are differences between the poor and the rich. They only know that the poor are always poor, either because of "bad fate" or "predestination in a previous life."</p>
<p>It is the same with seeking education. Only the children of the rich can enter the doors of grand "schools," while the poor scholars can only dream about it. But the poor simply accept their "fate" in confusion.</p>
<p>However, we also often see that the sons and daughters of wealthy families often use school as a guise, spending their days and nights in "singing stages and dancing halls" and "restaurants and teahouses." The number of such individuals is considerable, and this is truly a great loss to the nation, the country, and even the entire human race. And the lives of these young ladies and gentlemen either revolve around the "love-supremacy circle" or they seek a way out in the Huangpu River or Lai Shaer, "taking their lives lightly." This cannot but cause deep pain and regret for these "inactive youths."</p>
<p>Conversely, we often hear the so-called "old saying" that "noble sons come from poor families." In fact, it is true. We often see students who work hard, strive for progress, and excel in both academics and conduct are often from poor families.</p>
<p>However, the poor scholars who can enter schools are still a minority within a minority, and an absolute majority of children are rejected outside the school gates, unable to even enter elementary school. As for middle school and university, it is truly "beyond their reach."</p>
<p>But who can guarantee that among this vast majority of children, there are no outstanding talents? Who dares to say that this is not caused by society? Who dares to say that this is not a loss to the nation and the country?</p>
<p>Here, we can say that the "Shen Bao Scholarship" is very meaningful. We cannot just watch the current situation without trying to partially improve the existing facilities before "national education" is implemented and before society is thoroughly transformed. At the same time, we cannot just watch a major loss to the country without trying to remedy it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that "scholarships" are an urgent movement that needs to be widely promoted today. It is not limited to Shen Bao or a corner of Shanghai, but is a nationwide cause. Because the poor children's desire to study is not so much a right given to them by the country, I think it is better to say that it is the obligation that the people should fulfill.</p>
<p>Therefore, scholarships are not just an act of "charity," but a cause that benefits the nation and the country. This significance must not be ignored. Here, I hope that the Shen Bao will develop it broadly.</p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>— Pei Lun</p>
<p>Girl A (indignantly): Brother! Can't women be independent?</p>
<p>Boy A (frankly): You are not pretty.</p>
<p>Question: Lao Li! Which school are you planning to apply to?</p>
<p>Answer: Me? If I can't get into the ____ Chemical Engineering Department, then I'll apply to the _____ Accounting Department.</p>
<p>Commercial teacher A (resentfully): These students who failed last semester are really bastards. None of them showed up for the make-up exam yesterday. Have they all forgotten?</p>
<p>Teacher B (laughing before speaking): They probably thought that the marks they saved last year should accrue interest, and with half a year of "interest," they could pass, right?</p>
<h3>Another Small Statistic</h3>
<p>— Yao Quan</p>
<p>According to my experiment with No. 1 foreign rice, a bowl of rice weighs nine taels and has more than 15,440 grains. One tael has more than 1,710 grains. One shi of rice on the market is 160 catties, that is, one sheng is 1.6 catties, that is, 25.6 taels, so one sheng is more than 44,400 grains, one dou is more than 444,000 grains, and one shi is more than 4,440,000 grains. The current market price is 130 yuan, that is, one sheng is worth 1.3 yuan, one tael is worth slightly less than 5.1 cents, one bowl is worth 45.7 cents, and one grain is worth about 30 hundred-thousandths.</p>
<h3>The Merit of Street Lights</h3>
<p>— Tang Youmei</p>
<p>The street light in our lane has many merits:</p>
<p>(1) Passers-by will not be tripped by the piles of garbage.</p>
<p>(2) Children can still play there in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>(3) The four mahjong wives across the street can recycle waste and "play mahjong" under it. According to them, this is "electricity saving"!</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>— Ling Zhonglu</p>
<p>Beggar: Miss, please do a good deed and give me a few cents so I can buy a sesame seed cake to eat...</p>
<p>Modern girl: You won't get anything from me. Let me introduce someone to you. (Pointing to a young man in a suit in front.)</p>
<p>"Mom, why are they still wearing so many clothes in such hot weather?"</p>
<p>— C.T.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Eleven Midnight Song</p>
<p>"Ah! Sister-in-law." Mei Bao immediately interrupted her thoughts, turned her head and replied with a smile. "Thank you, I seem to be feeling better. I drank two bowls of noodle soup today!"</p>
<p>Meng's daughter-in-law deftly lifted the lid of the medicine pot a little to prevent the boiling juice from overflowing.</p>
<p>"Noodle soup is not very good. You should actually drink some lotus root powder, which is the most beneficial thing after a serious illness!" she said concerned as she sat down on a bamboo chair.</p>
<p>"Isn't that stuff very expensive now?" Mei Bao asked, clueless.</p>
<p>"It's not that expensive." Meng's daughter-in-law lowered her voice and said, "Sister, don't think I'm trying to drum up business for our family. If you want to buy real lotus root powder, we have plenty in our shop. About thirty cents a box should be enough. This stuff is good for people who have suffered a serious illness!"</p>
<p>Mei Bao put down the fan in her hand and hesitated for a minute or two.</p>
<p>"Let's buy two boxes to try and see if it works?" She took out a few small silver dollars from her right pocket and counted them. "I'll trouble you to take the money first!"</p>
<p>Meng's daughter-in-law hurriedly shook her head to stop her.</p>
<p>"No hurry, I'll bring it over and then calculate the money!"</p>
<p>"Why be so polite?" Mei Bao forced six cents into the other's palm. "But, good sister-in-law, when you see my father later, don't tell him this price; if he hears it's thirty cents a box, he'll be too heartbroken to eat it again!" (161)</p>
<p>A Hoarding Family</p>
<h3>Like Father Like Son</h3>
<p>— Yu Er</p>
<p>You can't take it with you when you die, nor can you bring it with you when you're born. Make the descendants destitute, hoarded until the coffin lid is used.</p>
<p>The bell rang three times, which was the scheduled time for the funeral. Many relatives and friends gathered in the auditorium to pay their respects and bow. Suddenly, someone shouted in the crowd:</p>
<p>"The coffin lid is gone, what do we do!"</p>
<p>This caused a commotion, and everyone was discussing it. I was confused, but an old man next to me murmured:</p>
<p>"This deceased old gentleman left a lot of property behind. His three sons are arguing over the inheritance. The eldest son said that the youngest son secretly embezzled a lot of his father's property. The youngest son said that the eldest son 'siphoned off' a lot of money due to his convenience in his position. They accused and argued with each other. I don't know which son hid the coffin lid, probably as a threat to get a satisfactory share of the inheritance."</p>
<p>I just nodded. He took a sip of tea, stroked his walrus mustache and continued:</p>
<p>"This old gentleman has really good 'vision'. He made a lot of money on those several thousand bags of rice, and he still has hundreds of bags in his hands; hoarding coal, kerosene, and domestic matches... everything makes money. He himself is very frugal and doesn't want to waste a single cent. He doesn't drink alcohol or smoke. He never eats a meal or snack in a restaurant. He always relies on his two feet when he goes out. The clothes he wears are all old and tattered, so he can have so much property! I relied on him a lot in business..." He stopped there, his eyes reddening.</p>
<p>"So, what disease did he die of!" I asked</p>
<p>"Oh! He died of a stroke. Yesterday morning, he was still fine when he was discussing with me at my house whether to hoard flour." He replied with a tone of grief.</p>
<p>I just grumbled:</p>
<p>"You can't bring money with you when you're born, and you can't take it with you when you die, so why be like this? You make a lot of money, only to become a beast of burden for your descendants, and in the end, you end up with nothing and cause a family feud, unable to be buried in peace..."</p>
<p>Time slipped away mercilessly, and evening arrived. The corpse emitted a foul odor due to the hot weather, which was nauseating</p>
<p>I couldn't wait for this hoarder's encoffining, so I embarked on my journey home.</p>
<p>New History of the Scholars</p>
<h3>Dr. Lang</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>"Doctor of Chemistry from the University of Berlin, Germany, member of the Dyeing and Chemical Society, permanent member of the Engineering Society, director of the ______ Chemical Industry Factory, director of the ______ Mechanical Manufacturing Factory..."</p>
<p>Just Dr. Lang's business card is impressive enough!</p>
<p>The outline of the doctor is very clear: a body like a clumsy ox, paired with a shrunken head and neck, rat eyes, a big mouth, and two kite-like ears.</p>
<p>Certainly, anytime, anywhere, he always has to hold a cigarette, hanging on his lips in a "Q" shape.</p>
<p>Although the doctor is the factory director, it is difficult for him to go to the factory, and he disdains to even run to the workshop. Occasionally, when he visits, he just flips through the production sheet and finishes half a cup of black tea. He likes to go to the "head office" as much as possible, where he echoes the manager in the manager's office and joins in the fun.</p>
<p>The first opening line is always: "When I was in Berlin..."; then, he will talk about how many stars there are in the sky in total, that the moon and the earth will collide sooner or later, that Hitler's hairstyle was secretly taught by his grandmother, and that Stalin's walrus mustache is combed twice a day...</p>
<p>He will also explain how the acidity of sugared plums belongs to a certain chemical atom, the comparison of the nutrition of Cantonese fermented bean curd and Shaoxing dried vegetables, and even "the Portuguese who won the first prize in the last horse race once rode the underground train with me in Berlin"... and then end with "when I was in Berlin."</p>
<p>In less than five minutes, another "when I was in Berlin..." starts again!</p>
<p>Although the doctor is so idle, he never slacks off because of it. He has to manage everyone's affairs:</p>
<p>—Hmph, you don't even know how to tie a tie!</p>
<p>—Why don't you pair such a beautiful robe with a pair of German leather shoes?</p>
<p>—You've been fooled, the best lens is still German-made.</p>
<p>In the evening, it is the active period of the doctor, from the cinema to the bar, from the dance hall to the night garden, bar girls, dancers, anesthetize every nerve of the doctor—the doctor's head shrinks even more, and even his neck cannot be seen!</p>
<p>The doctor always holds a German newspaper in his hand, and his desk is full of German dictionaries, dyeing engineering, and chemical encyclopedias (of course, all in German)!</p>
<p>The doctor's biggest regret is: "German is not too popular in China", which makes the doctor's full of "German treasures" nowhere to display, which is really a pity!</p>
<p>Maybe some people think the doctor is a German? No! The doctor's origin is authentic:</p>
<p>"______ County, Jiangsu Province, Republic of China"</p>

<h3>Rambling on Film Matters</h3>
<p>Hollywood has two "three brothers", one is the Lees Three Brothers, and the other is the Marx Three Brothers. These six treasures all appear to us in films as silly clowns. To be more precise, the roles and actions played by these six treasures are not worthy of being called "comedic", but can only be said to be foolish and nonsensical. Their actions are mostly slapstick and take vulgarity as fun.</p>
<p>In fact, playing a comedic role is the most difficult. The purpose, of course, is to make the audience laugh, but it is not just to make the audience laugh and then forget it forever, leaving no impression in their hearts. The comedic action should give the audience an inspiration in addition to making them laugh.</p>
<p>Comparing the Lees Three Brothers and the Marx Three Brothers to Chaplin, we can see this. This shows that a comedic role is not easy to play. Trying to paint a tiger but ending up with something that resembles a dog can also be used here as a metaphor. Among these two "three brothers", the Lees Three Brothers' acting skills are slightly better.</p>
<h3>The Home of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Dou Jun</p>
<p>"Home" is currently being produced by the National League. The film has two female leads, both of whom recently moved house, one is Chen Yunshang, who plays "Qin", and the other is Chen Yanyan, who plays "Wufeng".</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Chen Yunshang originally lived on the third floor of No. 1 Ziming Apartment on Julaiyuan Road. Last month, because the old residence was not sufficient, she once moved to No. 318 Jierdian Road, Fukaissen Road. The house was very spacious and had a small garden with green grass, wild flowers in full bloom, and willow branches hanging down. The scenery was quite beautiful. However, Chen Yunshang moved from Jierdian Road to a small Western-style house on Hengli Road, Henry Road because the area was too humid. The new home has a small garden as soon as you enter, with soft willows and gorgeous flowers. It is indeed a great place to cool off in summer.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan originally lived in the Lincoln Apartment opposite the Dike Milk Company at the end of Xifei Road. Yuan Meiyun also lived in the Lincoln Apartment before moving into Hengye Lane, Aidoo Road. The rooms in the apartment are quite spacious, but recently Chen Yanyan began to move house after the contract expired. Chen Yanyan and Huang Shaofen's new home is the Ziming Apartment where Chen Yunshang used to live, but not the same room that Chen Yunshang used to live in. In recent years, Shanghai has been overcrowded, and everyone finds it difficult to live. Seeing movie stars living in tall buildings, I can't help but envy them.</p>

<h3>Remembering the Demise of Gui Junqing</h3>
<p>— Jingcun</p>
<p>In the past two months, Yan Jupeng, Song Baoluo, Ji Yuliang, and female performer Xu Dongming, among others, have come to Shanghai. They have repeatedly performed the play "The Empty City Stratagem," leading to reminiscences of the late Tan-school veteran Gui Junqing. His performances were truly masterful, endlessly captivating. In his time, he was known by the elegant title of "Living Kongming." His poised demeanor with a feather fan in hand was unparalleled among performers of today. Throughout his life, the places where he performed the longest were the Zhifu, Yingzhou, Dan Gui, and Tianxian theaters, rotating among them and serving as a pillar of support for six years, maintaining his great reputation without decline. In the winter of 1919, while performing at the Dan Gui Theater, one evening, the customs supervisor of the port, special commissioners, and the police chief were present. They watched him perform "Selling Horses" with Zhu Suyun and Qi Yanbing (Huang Yulin's teacher). Unexpectedly, when he was about to go on stage, he had not yet redeemed his stage costume from pawn. He hastily put on an old and tattered robe from the troupe and went on stage. However, the costumes worn by Qi and Zhu were bright and dazzling, which Gui did not find shameful. Later, the dignitaries learned of his deep addiction to opium, which he kept secret. He was exceptionally impoverished, so they provided three hundred yuan to help him redeem all his costumes. According to Junqing's artistic skills, he was superior to Wang Youchen, but he remained perpetually unfulfilled. Nevertheless, the elder performers in the Peking opera world all respected him. He had particularly close relationships with Shi Huibao and Zhu Suyun. He came to Shanghai three times, but unfortunately, he never achieved the fame of Tan Xiaopei or Ma Lianliang.</p>
<p>A Quick Sketch of a Film Star</p>
<h3>(16) Olivia De Havilland</h3>
<p>— Xiaolang</p>
<p>This on-screen lover of Errol Flynn was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1916. At the age of four, she returned to the United States. While studying at university, her performance in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" established her as a silver screen star. She is five feet four inches tall, weighs 107 pounds, and has brown and sparkling eyes. Her hobby is collecting antique love letters. She recently co-starred in a new film with tough-guy actor James Cagney.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Helpless, Like Ning Wu</p>
<p>Liu Yinying and Xu Jing finished their preparations, each took their weapons, went to the courtyard, led their two steeds, left the temple gate, and leapt into their saddles. Xu Jing led the way, with Liu Yinying following behind, galloping towards Ningwu Pass. They saw many refugees ahead, supporting the old and leading the young, fleeing wildly in disarray. Among them were a few soldiers, faces dirty, unarmed. Xu Jing knew that Ningwu Pass had indeed fallen. He immediately stopped one of them and asked him what had happened. The soldier recognized Xu Jing and told them the story of Ningwu's fall. It turned out that after Xu Jing went to battle, Zhou Yuji had not yet finished repairing the city walls. When Xu Jing did not return, he assumed the worst and was filled with remorse, vowing to die there. He stood on the ramparts and saw the rebels attacking the city like swarms of bees and ants. He instructed his subordinates to release logs, rolling stones, and arrows towards the base of the city. Indeed, the rebels were unsuccessful and retreated slightly. However, because the rebels were divided into ten teams, attacking in shifts, the city was unable to rest, and the soldiers were extremely exhausted. Zhou Yuji and Zhang Lie personally supervised the battle from the city walls, executing anyone who retreated. By dusk, Zhou Yuji had not yet eaten. Suddenly, a cannonball flew onto the city wall, destroying a corner of the drum tower, alarming the Ming soldiers. Cannonballs continued to rain down on the pass. Li Zicheng, having suffered from the pass's cannons, listened to Niu Jinxing's advice and sent people to Taiyuan to retrieve several seized cannons and a dozen gunners to assist in the attack on Ningwu. By chance, the cannons arrived that day and were added to the first team, positioned, and aimed at the city, firing incessantly. Zhou Yuji's cannons, however, could not be fired due to the exhaustion of gunpowder, leaving him unable to defend and forced to rely on arrows. But the cannon fire was extremely fierce, and the city walls were not yet repaired, causing a corner to collapse. The rebels surged into the breach like a tide. Once inside, they set fires everywhere. The government troops were in chaos, and the people fled in all directions, the sounds of crying and shouting blending into one. At this moment, in this place, it was truly unknown what world it was! (118)</p>
<h3>Jin Suqin Announces Retirement</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since returning to Shanghai from Saigon, Jin Suqin has not officially joined any theater troupe, except for rare guest appearances. She was invited to perform in "Napoleon" at the Great Theater, but it was unsuccessful. According to Jin Suqin, she will no longer appear on stage.</p>

<h3>George Raft Plays a Different Tune</h3>
<p>— Xinjuan</p>
<p>The romance between Norma Shearer and George Raft once caused a sensation in Hollywood (see this publication from the 6th of this month). George has always been known in Hollywood as the star who has suffered the most from heartbreak. Years ago, he was deeply involved with Virginia Pine, but because George's ex-wife had never formally divorced him, they never had the possibility of marriage.</p>
<p>Later, for a period of time, George fell in love with Norma Shearer. It seemed that their ardor had reached one hundred degrees. In George's house, every room had photos of Norma, and he even carried several photos of her on his person. Norma's room also had photos of George. However, the heat suddenly dropped like a mercury thermometer. George and Norma's beautiful dream was difficult to fulfill, and they broke up. Their love turned into a bubble, which naturally caused them endless emotion and hidden pain.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer is a graceful and luxurious woman on screen, and is even called the "first lady of the screen." As for George Raft, he is a stalwart man with a calm and forthright personality. In terms of temperament, it was indeed difficult for the two of them to get along.</p>
<p>Now George's new target is Hollywood's "Best Physique Actress," Betty Grable. Betty had no great fame before, but she rose to stardom with "Down Argentine Way" and "Tin Pan Alley." Betty's personality is frank and innocent, which suits George very well. They first met at a nightclub in Hollywood. At that time, Betty was working at the nightclub. The next day, they even went for a bicycle ride together. Soon after, Betty married Jack Gegan, a child star who was popular twenty years ago. During this time, she and George lost contact. Later, she and her husband announced their divorce in 1939.</p>
<p>Not long after Betty's divorce, she encountered George at Paramount Studios. At the time, they only exchanged a few brief greetings before shaking hands and saying goodbye. One month after George and Norma broke up, Betty suddenly received a phone call from George at home, inviting her out. Since then, they have been inseparable, going to nightclubs and public places together. George gave her a gold and pearl cigarette case and a diamond necklace to express his love.</p>
<p>George Raft is playing a different tune, abandoning "Marie Antoinette" Norma Shearer and falling in love with Betty Grable. This news has caused a sensation in Hollywood, and the outcome is still unpredictable!</p>
