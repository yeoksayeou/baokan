<h3 id="c8">演進中的國際三方面 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>凡此前途，皆將立刻影響及於國際當局，雖淵源甚遠，醞釀已久，但最近數日則相繼開展到了一觸即發的階段，而成爲當前最堪注目的三形態：其一，保加利亞所受壓迫備極嚴重，內而政治，外而中立，其勢岌岌皆將不克持續其原狀。其二，泰國政府已宣布泰越邊境在所謂戰爭狀態之中。其三，美國在事實上卸脫了中立的外衣，坦然向國際作銳角的猛進。這三者，皆非突然的局部事情。</p>
<p>關於保加利亞的一切消息忽爾紛傳，忽爾吾認，撲朔迷離，眞相難辨；但經驗告訴我們，這不是無中生有，而是空穴來風；不是虛幻，而是暴露之前的噯昧；不是局外的搗亂，而是內部消弭變端與促成變故之間的鬥法。在去年十一月中旬，保國幾乎爲了不勝壓迫而繼匈牙利與羅馬尼亞二國之後，加入德義軸心；乃因蘇聯表示異議，遂勒馬懸崖。時經五旬而至今日，保國又動搖了。今日尚難明嘹鬥法誰獲了勝，亦即尚難明瞭五旬間的蘇聯與德義，彼此怎樣佈局。蘇聯在國際的一切皆極高明，但給國際覷定了它決不願意以實力相拚，則成爲它對付國際的唯一弱點所在；有此弱點，遂不難爲國際的亡命之徒所「吃癟」。茲不必問保國當局怎樣取舍，其人民怎樣向背，總之，倘若未能消弭變端而竟更張其原狀了，則巴爾幹立即發生絕大波濤，其初步必影響及於希臘與義大利之間的戰略，次將影響及於土耳其，南斯拉夫，乃至蘇聯的中立。</p>
<p>關於泰國與法屬越南，由外交折衝而武裝衝突，幾個月來，忽稍緩弛，忽極緊張。假定昨日所傳泰國政府宣佈泰越邊境入於戰爭狀態，確屬無訛，則在國際公法上的解釋，雖不能遽視爲宣戰，但較之閉口的武裝衝突，却大異其趣。茲不必申述宣佈局部戰爭狀態，所影響及於國際第三者的權利義務如何，但須看做泰國與越南，亦即與法國，不免於正式戰爭的趨勢。問題太複雜而微妙了。泰國有種種與日本相勾結的姿態，而其本身的脆弱，國際的利害，則絕對經不起英美方面的任何壓力。越南當局宣示抗戰決心，一朝作戰，維希政府固決不坐視，而特戈爾將軍方面亦當然不直泰國。眞好像是沒有快刀所能解決的亂絲，亦非痛癢相關的諸國所會放任自生自滅的爭執。然則泰國的與國是誰，法越的與國是誰，國際對於這一爭執究成如何分野？雖然，初期容許混沌，最後必趨澄淸，其間演變殆非今日的任何方面所能把握。有關諸國或在今日猶不暇參預及此，但至正式戰爭狀態一朝成立的時候，立刻成爲有關諸國所必須即予解答的嚴重課題。</p>
<p>開於美國的態度，本報既於昨日稱述之為已入新紀元。昨夜又悉美國當局為使海軍「迎合事實」起見，業已重加分配，從事於充分戰時力量的準備」；分全部海軍力量爲三大艦隊，置於大西洋者一，置於太平洋者二，而以太平洋艦隊司令兼三大艦隊的總司令。對此措置，世人必能判別其重輕，體味其意義。此外，復悉美國以戰爭原料租借於中國英國希臘的法案，將在國會急速登程。美國國會通過了總統羅斯福氏所提軍備法案之後，將由美國人民每日負担軍費美金四干八百萬圓；這是比較一般交戰國所支付之更偉大的數字啊。由美國這一種劍及屨及的精神，愈趨愈強的步驟，說明美國在國際並沒有「不願意實力相拚」的弱點；而它所剩戰不戰的問題，祇問侵略國家是否向它挑釁而已！</p>
<p>正常的推論上列三形態，則每一形態的開展，便是世界戰局的延擴。我們雖不願見戰局延擴，但延擴每非意願所得制止；而保加利亞實是最易使戰局延擴的媒介。至於美國，以中英兩國的勝敗爲勝敗，是其最賢明的見解；以援助中英希三國的作戰，替代躬自赴戰，是其最賢明的政策；蓋由正常推論，德國若不能打敗英國則決不敢再向美國挑釁，日本若不能打敗中國亦決不敢再向美國挑釁，故美國祇要力援中英，自可不必直接作戰；然日德二國終必確認若不克服美國即無法打敗中英，在此確認之下，將為知機而退，抑爲行險徼倖而向美國啟釁？事屬不可知，亦即安危和戰之數各半。况泰越若竟戰爭，則其後果，行將影響新加坡與菲列賓以及緬甸的軍略地位，若此則火綫愈逼近美國了。</p>

<p>— 陣立夫</p>
<p>總之，我國的人生敎育，是將對人處世修身合而爲一的自遠古至於現在，乃至無窮盡的將來，都是一貫的保存在每個人的性靈裏，一則緊要的時候，就發揮出無限的光芒，　艾士說：「一個人只有盡忠於此他本人更偉大的事件而後滿足，」J·Royee　Philosophg　of　Royalty）我們中國人對於處置偉大事件，是從來不輕易放過的，所謂士窮見節義，這是幾千來多少仁人義士留下的極實貴的敎訓，現在我們的靑年所表現的一切，正是這個敎訓的複演，日本以爲不可忽視而感覺震驚，在我們正是家常便飯毫不足奇了。</p>
<p>我們有這些可愛的靑年，對於我們抗建的前途，將會發生怎樣的結果，我想這個答案，人人都已瞭然於胸，用不着詳加叙述了，不過或者還有人會懷疑我是故作樂觀的宣傳，仍不得不引證一部份事實，以告慰於全國的同胞。</p>
<p>第一是現在我們靑年的思想行動，比較更爲切合實際，過去一般空談幻想之弊，已逐漸减少了，自日人對我國文物摧毀，我們唯一答復，就是拚命的建設，現在的成績，自然是離去理想甚遠，但以其進步的速度來說，相信我們中央對於建設新中國的偉大規模，一定可以由現時的靑年來完成，現有兩件最明顯的事例，可以作爲推設的根據，一是現在學生對於學習的志向，大多數都趨向實科，茲將近三年各公立專科以上學校錄取學生人數統計表列如次：</p>
<p>又投考學生總數，二十七年一一·一一九人，二十八年二〇·〇〇六人，二十九年約二萬餘人，爲甚麼進工科的人特別多，就是爲社會的需要大，也就是表明建設事業的猛晉，其决是學生畢業後的出路，已不若從前那樣感覺困難，每屆畢業的時期，敎育部即將所有畢業生的人數，依照所習科別，分別向各機關介紹，但結果都是需要者多過於供給者，有許多學校的畢業生，大部份均不等介紹就被人爭聘而去，我們現在惟一感覺到的困難，就是現有的學校，不能盡量容納志切入學的學生，大家都一致看到今後的建設事業，還要大大的加速發展，需要的建設人才，比目前不知還要增若干倍數，不只工科如此，文法商師範等亦復相同，因此在一般學生的意念中，都有一個極其嚴重的感覺，就是將如何應用自己的學力來爭取社會的地位，於是不知不覺的都養成了一種切實努力的風氣，雖在空襲不斷威脅之下，防空洞中一樣有人在上課讀書。（未完）</p>

<p>春秋奇  淑英　　曰：囤米囤煤，扒進扒出，在現在已經是件「不足爲奇」的事情了。　　爲什麼？大的如此：　　有錢無處化，沒錢想發財：即使是家產蕩盡，借錢做債，也總得冒上一冒「險」，去囤它一下，去扒它一次——（其實是無險可冒）。　　因爲：輿論制裁，空月也；「違必嚴懲」，更空言也。所以「打駡儘管打駡，囤扒我自爲之」；又何况「上面」祇駡不「打」？　　以此推彼，那末凍死，餓斃，吃人的嘔食，鑽進棺村作眠床……也變得「不足爲奇」了。　　可是，愈是「不奇」，則愈奇；現在「不奇」，待大家睡一覺醒來，睜開眼，那才奇哪！五張太少了！  厲行　　中午，哥哥吃中飯回家，帶來五張施衣券，叫我午後去施發，並可囑我說：「一定要發給眞正貧苦的人，尤其是那些老弱婦孺。」　　飯後，帶着五張施衣券，興冲冲地走出家門。　　街上冷酷的北風在在歌飛舞，舞進人們的衣袖裏，使人不禁地打起寒顫。但這冷酷的北風却不敢吹到高貴人們的身上去，老天爺也祇有在窮人身上出出氣！　　而幾條繁鬧的街道却依舊浸沈在春氣裏：一九四一年新型的汽車勗起了頭怪叫着在路上飛馳；大酒樓的玻璃櫉窗內瀰漫着乳白色的水汽，當大舞廳的門被穿着筆挺制服的看門童子拉開的時候，一股暖洋洋的熱氣就冲到街上；而坐在戲院裏的人正在吃冰結漣解熱呢！路上的老爺太太們都披上絲絨大氅，行人道是熙熙攘攘的蕩漾着春意。在這裏的人那裏會知道現在已是冬天的呢？　　我袖起了雙手，急急地穿過了幾條熱鬧的馬路，向靜僻的地方走去。漸漸地我走上狹小崎嶇的街道，於是我一面走，一面張望搜尋起我的目的物了。又走了不遠，果然看見在一道短籬笆下跪着一個老叟在求乞，鬢髮　是灰白了，瘦弱的身子外面祇裹着一件單衣在那裏幾微抖，我趕緊走上去，拿出一張施衣劵放在他的手裏，對他說：「老先生，你不是覺得很冷嗎？請快拿了這張紙去領棉衣來穿吧！」　　老頭兒看看手上的紙頭，又抬起頭來望望我，不信地說：「這張紙可換棉衣嗎？」　　「是的，這是施衣券呀！」我用手點點紙上的字，雖然我知道他是不識字的。　　老頭兒一聽見是施衣券，就急忙從上爬起來，「呀！是施衣券呀！少爺，謝謝你了。」說完話匆匆地走去了。　　老頭兒剛走開，正當我回身的時候，迎面忽然走來個婦人，背上揹着一個嬰兒，蓬着頭髪，憔悴的面容，哀求着說：「先生，也請給我一張吧！我凍極了，孩子也冷得整天在哭，先生，請可憐我吧！」　　我看看那背上的嬰孩，正擺着凍紅了的手足在哭，就連忙拿出一張來，給了她後走開　　剛走了沒幾步，後面又追來一個小孩，的有六七歲模樣，赤着脚，披着大而破的衣服，哀求着說：「先生，請給我一張吧！我眞冷死了！」一對烏溜溜的眼珠向我痴望着，對這天眞而可憐的小孩，我又不得不給他張了。　　這小孩拿了施衣劵快樂極了，連忙飛跑開去，一面還大聲地喊着：「阿毛，阿黃，快去問這位先生討施衣券呀！」　　立刻，有六七個孩子奔到我面前，伸出手喊着：「先生請給我一張吧。」　　看看這一羣可憐小孩都是我該援助的，可是劵祇有二張了，怎够分配呢？我就將最後的二張給了較小的二個。　　拿到的二個走開了，但當我抬頭一看，呀！不得了，我的身邊不知在那時已團團圍着二三十個人，有老的，小的，女的，都伸着手喊着：「先生，請給我一張吧！」　　我窘住了，不知怎樣好，祇有大聲回答說：「沒有了，沒有了。」並且用手拍拍袋袋，表示眞的沒有了。　　但他們依舊不放鬆地喊着：「先生，請給我一張吧！」我沒有法想，祇有用力衝出重圍，慚愧地拔脚就逃了。　　跑了一陣，歇卜回頭一看，那和遠遠地還有好幾個追來，隱隱地還聽見喊着。。「先生，請可憐我給我一張吧！」　　沒法！我又得拔脚再逃了來源阻梗（？）  馬戈作奮鬬的人生觀（五）　　人生就是奮鬥，每建立奮鬥的人生觀，先要從練識志練胆入手。心理上有了堅强的基礎，然後再談奮鬥的方法，「盈科而後進，放乎四海，」倘使沒有心理的基礎，所謂奮鬥，不免客氣用事。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　師傳照例對他非常客氣，—一大半當然因爲是他在班子裏最能賣錢的緣故—自己在一張帳臺前面坐定之後，也敎他在另外一把椅子上坐下去。　　玉琴把臀部挨住了椅子的邊沿，半坐半站地候着，想不出師傳究竟要對他說什麼話。　　「會不會媽有什麼病嗎？」一個可怕的猜想，突然湧上了心頭。　　還好，師傳也並不存心想敎他難受，落坐不到一分鐘，便在他右手中所轉着的兩顆亮得變了紫色的胡桃所發出的一陣格格的聲饗裏開口了：　　「有一位袁師長你可認識嗎？」　　「袁師長？」玉琴格外愕然了。　　「我也猜你是不會認識的。」胡桃揑得格外的響了。「可是因爲每决出臺的時候，上後臺來胡鬧的人委實太多了，所以我想你或許會見過他。」　　「…」玉琴覺得沒有話好說，只能瞧着他師傳一顆紅鼻子發呆。　　「這人是一個帶兵的頭兒。」師傅皺着眉毛說，很明　地告訴玉琴，這種人是世界上最不容對付的傢伙。「不知道怎樣，他竟會瞧中了你啦…！」　　玉琴的臉色開始變得灰白起來。　　「初四那天，他敎我們的財東來跟我說，想叫你出去一次，和你交一個朋友…。」　　「師傳，你答應了沒有？」王琴急得來不及的站起來問。　師傅把沒有胡桃握着的左手向他做了個手勢。　　「坐下去！別這樣的焦急啊！這是破壞咱們班裏的規矩的事，財東儘管那末說，我如何能答應呢？」這個唱了三十多年武生的宋師傳，挺直了上身，依舊　着虎虎有生氣的樣子。「我告訴他說，別說現在是民國，當相公的早給大總統禁絕了，就是在前淸，咱們科班是科班，他們相公是相公，那有科班的學生，能隨便給人家叫出去的？財東相咱們十七八年的老朋友，聽我說得不錯，便依着去辭謝了…。」　（五）加學費與薪  羅盤　　年關才過得不久，學期　跟著結束了。當子女們一學期的成績報告單到手的時候，一張學費增加的通知單也附了來，下學期的學費普遍地又要漲上了三四成。　　在這個年頭兒，百物昂貴，學費耍加價，也是情理中的事，雖然這又給已經困難的家長們加上一重負担，但警察一月也有百多元呢！敎書先生的生活實在是太淸苦了。敎師們也耍吃飽了飯才有精神敎書啊　　爲了敎師們加薪而增加學費是無可非議的事，但是可注意的是許多學校不過是拿「加薪」做一個幌子吧了。允其是在這學校即私產的孤島上，加學費還不是加重了校長們的荷包。假使家長們加重了負担，而敎師們仍在束緊褲帶喝西北風，不過讓少數人更肥一些，那未免太豈有此理了。　　爲防止這種現象，我想可以由兩方面著手：　　第一，在家長及學生方面，應以下學期敎師所增加的薪水爲加費的準則，拒絕那種商店式的加幾成或幾元的方法來增加學費。切實的辦法，最好是學校的經濟能够公開，其次，也要校方決定加薪的辦法後才增加學費。　　第二，在敎師方面，應趕快組織起來，要求增加的學費，完全充作薪金，分配給全體敎師。監督校方不得將這筆費用流入私囊。　　當此學期結束，各物又在紛紛加價，下學期學費增加，於情於理，皆爲必然之事。而加費有切身利害關係的家長們及敎師們，希望能及早聯合起來，杜防吸血蟲的從中漁利鬼？  包福星　　傍晚，已經黑壓壓地來臨了。　　僻靜的馬路的人行道上，我獨自地趕着走。疏落的夜燈，在很濃的夜色中，發着散弱的光。　　經騐古訴我：前面已經到了近家的交叉路口。　　　突然：——　　寒冷的夜空中，傳過來低微而斷續的聲響。我依然向前走；忽然我覺察發出聲饗的東西，就在那水門汀的角落，我驚慌地向前衝跑一段。　　但聲響却向着我送來了，很響而且帶着抖動：　　「……先…生……我…已經…好…幾天……沒…有……吃飯……就…要……凍…死……了……求…你……救…救……命……」　　哦，原來這個東四是一個「人」！（酬移難捐）</p>

<p>游藝界一九四一年好萊塢展望  新影　　在一九四一年的開始，好萊塢在事實上所表現的，已可預測電影業在這一年中的動向。就目前所知道的比較重大的事件，可爲讀者報導者，有下面幾點：　　歷史影片再度風行　　據統計所得，在過去三年中，好萊塢各影片公司所拍攝的歷史影片，總共有一百六十三部。這個數字，不可謂不高，事實證明了美國的電影業的熱中於歷史劇上面。但各公司所採歷史上的電影題材，也自有其相當的界限。就是凡是美國史上的名人碩士，他們的歷史，可編成劇本的，才採作題村；尤其是偉人的事跡。如林肯·安迪生等，都已搬上銀幕。這種含有歷史意義的影片，因爲賣座的不衰，本年將繼縱拍攝。　　反德影片續繼攝制　　歐戰開始以後，好萊塢曾有過一决競攝反德反法斯蒂影片的瘋在。但不久因爲種種關係，有許多反德片，中止拍攝。主要的原因，爲顧全邦交和防止中立國家對此一類影片的拒映。可是自卓別麟的「大獨裁者」在紐的公映，賣座紀錄出於意料，加以德美國交，而今正更趨交惡之後，好萊塢有若干影片公司，已決定在一九四一年度繼續拍攝這一類的影片。大有就是攝成之後不能運往海外，單在美國公映，也滿不在乎的樣子。　　新人獵取男女向背　　　好萊塢影片公司對於新人的發掘，獲取，本來是極度注意的。不過新人的國籍，不限於本國，——十之七八來自歐洲各國。所以歐戰發生之後，就發生了問題。以男星說來，非但新人難於發現，就是已成明星的，也大都回國服役。而女的方面，爲了歐洲有不少婦女，到美國避難，其中一部分投奔好萊塢。所以在未來的一年中，可預料到又可發掘出幾顆歐籍的新女星。正和男星背道而馳。　　臨時演員實行改革　　因爲臨時演員的人數過多，同時，薪金又非常微薄；影片公司已決定自一九四一年起，在六千五百登記的臨時演員中，减去二千，而把這二千人的薪給，攤在四千五百人頭上。這樣一來，平均每一臨時演員，每年可獲得薪金五百五十元，吾則祇有三百五十元，生活方面，自可比較得能過去。因爲就目前的六千五百臨時演員，實有供過於求之概。就統計所得，有幾個每年拍不到十天戲，所得旣少，生活極度可憐，非减少不可。至於裁减的臨時演員，將由電影職工會予以職業訓練，使他們脫離銀幕後，實行改行，不致失業，也可說是面面顧到呢！綠寶最先上演「家」  紫虹　　自從國聯特使周貽百向巴金的老友索非氏取得「家」的電影攝製優先權後，「家」的舞台劇的上演高潮也繼着高漲起來，辣斐的吳天在趕寫「家」的劇本，聞關係人稱，最快也得在舊歷新年才趕得上上演，導演本來請吳仭之，但吳仭之最近因與其妻墨蘭女士離婚，情緒不佳，已婉言辭却了導演一職……冶兒劇團演楊貴妃　　冶兒劇團自加入大世界演藝以來，將近週年，遂日由張冶兒君親自指導，十分努力，前曾一度公演「阿Ｑ」，博得輿論界之好評。近又新編「楊貴妃」一劇，由朱卓君小姐飾「玉環」，預料公演後定可轟動一時。。但另一面，積極排練「家」的，倒是綠寶劇塲，並且由顧夢鶴等得分担主角，聞這决將舉行大規模演出，由沈凌等加演恐怖獨幕劇一齣，劇名爲「怨女離魂」，即今之電影「女鬼」，也即當時南國劇社最出鋒頭的「湖上的悲劇」。也是廣告糾紛　卡萊葛倫控某雜誌  重芬　　美國某著名趣味雜誌最近被好萊塢男明星卡萊葛倫起訴於法庭，因爲這本刊物上的廣告字句顯含侮辱他的地方。　　這本趣味雜誌常是鬧廣告糾紛的，不是同某名人便是同某明星鬧翻了。此决卡萊葛倫控告理由是因爲：該雜誌的封而裏頁有一張他本人的照相，而照相旁的字句是這樣的：「卡萊葛倫—白皮膚的美男子—最恨付稅呢」。要知道卡萊根本是一個黑皮膚的健兒，所以大與事實相違，而且付稅是每個公民的義務。修養要語（七）　　私人交際，以圓到爲上，辦理公事，以方正爲上，尖刻是到處行不通的，國為一味圓到，責任心太少，雖不開罪於人，但是公事往往有　，一味方正，熱情不足，集體生活的美德，究嫌缺乏，君子和而不同，是最好的做人方式。章臺柳  頋明道　　石達說到這裏，忽又縮住口，四下望了一望，問道：「外邊可有人竊聽嗎？俺尚有幾句緊要的話奉告呢。」柳如是便喚聲「碧桃，你且到裹面去停一回再來。」又向石達說道：「壯士，你有什麼話要說呢？」石達道：「柳夫人可知黃公毓祺現在舟山嗎？」柳如是嘆道：「國變以來，我等蟄伏於此，苟活人世，故國的遺臣大都不通聲氣了。石壯士，你須要原諒我的苦衷，眞有說不出的難言之痛呢。」石達點點頭道「柳夫人，你也不必說了。俺都在外邊探聽得明明白白，像你柳夫人是值得欽佩的，因此俺今天還要冒險趕來拜見呢。尚書可是到南京去了嗎？黃公很思念他咧。」柳如是微微嘆了一聲說道：「說也慚愧得很，尚書竟沒有殉節，反而附和在他們一起，這是任何人都不能原諒他的，淸夜思之，汗顏無已。我常想倘有好機會給尚盡補過自新，一滌今日的垢辱，道是寤寐求之的。黃公毓祺在舟山嗎？可有什麼好消息？」石達捋着虬髯說道：「俺此來就是報告與柳夫人聽一個好消息的。」柳如是欣然道：「那麼請壯士快講。這裏四下無人，不虞漏洩。」石達道：「俺到舟山時，湊巧黃公也在那邊。黃公自隨閻典史等苦守江陰八十三日，城破時，黃公逃生，潛渡大海，想要請兵于鎭南伯。豈知事機不密，被一僧人洩其事於外，黃公險遭不測，逃遁而免，後來他又曾一度秘密回到江陰，和生員徐趨，的衆於八月十五之夜起事。但是又給人家自首告發，徐趨倉卒發砲，以致失敗。黃公持劍蹈海而去，反害了同黨二百人，仍沒有能成大事。」（三一）瓦釜室雜談  倪秋萍　　舊劇的本子，往往有十分惡劣的。有時候出乎情理之外，弄得莫明其妙。但是積習已久，大家都在腔調身段上去研究，對於劇情彷彿不在乎似的。下面所舉的，便可由此知道一般了。　　「武家坡」一劇，風行一時，差不多家弦戶誦。我們看薛平貴推說將書信失落，而王寶川就咒駡起來了。那戲中的老生扮平貴，當時就說：「……薜大哥在修書的時節，我在一旁，打點行李，偷看了幾句，故爾記得。……」等語。但是老生唱完倒板，扮王寶的靑衣，並不問書信的事，反倒問軍營連燈亮都無有，可謂閒情逸致。簡直從此不提書信，來了兩個「我問他，好來」「我問他，安寗」。以後便扯到旁的問題上去了。　　再有「寶蓮燈」，劉彥昌爲了兒子打死了人，忽然來大段唱工。所譬喩的伯夷叔齊，也覺得牛頭不對馬嘴。這還不說，後來王桂英出來，也是一些不知輕重，左一個「莫不是」，右一個「莫不是」，這比「武家坡」又覺不如了。尚有別的戲裏，像這樣情形的很多很多。稍爲用心觀察一下，沒有不使你耍哈哈大笑的。「孔夫子」徵文　加贈中學組獎品　　孔夫子影片徵文舉辦以來，各界熱心贊助，紛粉接洽加贈獎品，除世界書局附贈該局出版名著多種，已經本刊披露外，本報徵文部茲復接山城書店來函，加贈李毓鏞著「葉」二十冊，作爲中學組獎品。該書對於葉的外形搆造生活及與人生之關係，叙述頗詳，足爲研究植物學之參攷，故參加微文獲獎者，旣得鉅額獎學金，復有附贈獎品多種可得。　　金門退出聯合陣线　　獨家放映二輪米高梅片福煦路金門大戲院，遇去與巴黎麗都光陸三家影院，搆成聯合陣錢，作巡迥的放映，因爲映期的嚴格規定，每張影片的映期，多至三天，少則二天，沒有機會延長。就有不少電影觀衆，要求展期重映。金門當局爲迎合覜衆要求起見，等到本屆四院聯合的合的滿期後，決意獨樹一幟，放映歐美有名公司鉅片，現已與米高梅簽訂合同，所有一九四〇年至一九四一年的一一輪鉅片，槪由金門獨家放映。</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. to Greatly Expand Defense Facilities in Various Regions of the Pacific; $35 Million Gold Dollars Earmarked; Kimmel Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt, in his budget message to Congress yesterday, essentially declared that the United States will greatly expand its defense facilities in the Pacific, including Guam, the Philippines, the Samoan Islands, Hawaii, Palmyra, Johnston Island, and Midway Island. President Roosevelt plans to earmark over 35 million U.S. dollars in this area. The Navy Department plans to spend $1,437,500 on Guam and $5.5 million in the Fourteenth Naval District to deepen and improve port waterways, etc. A year ago, the Navy Department's request for funds within the Fourteenth District to improve Guam was rejected by Congress. This time, the government will again ask Congress for approval. An additional $13 million is requested for projects in Hawaii. The Navy Department will also request $215,000 for Philippine defense projects, the largest amount in recent years. Of the Guam expenditure, $187,500 will be used to expand military motor roads and $250,000 to improve power plants. In addition, a storage depot for seaplanes will be built on Midway Island, a gasoline depot on Johnston Island, and $1,491,000 will be used in Sitka, Alaska (formerly the capital of the Russian era). A naval air station will be built in Dutch Harbor, requiring $2,292,000. The Army Department's expenses have not yet been published, but its expenditure in the Philippines is expected to be comparable to that of the Navy. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - Of all the items in the U.S. budget, the one that may draw the most attention in the Far East is the section concerning the Navy Department. This section states in very clear terms that the United States intends to build the largest navy the world has ever seen. Last year's naval expenditure was already very large, but this year's expenditure is about 100 million yuan higher than last year's. This budget stipulates that the item for new construction and machinery is about $1,135,000,000 (last year it was $561,000,000). In addition, it stipulates that the expense for armament, ordnance, and ammunition is $380,000,000. This year's naval air force budget is $434,000,000 (last year it was $355,000,000). The maintenance cost for warships is also set at $206,000,000, and the expenditure for artillery is $167,000,000. The increase in the number of naval personnel can also be seen in the new figure for naval salaries, which has increased from $284,000,000 last year to $411,000,000 this year. This year's expenditure on naval docks and shipyards will also reach $175,000,000. President Roosevelt estimates a shortfall of $9,210,000,000, which will create an unprecedented public debt of $58,367,000,000, and the current public debt limit of $49,000,000,000 will inevitably increase. The deficit in 1931 was only $16,185,000,000. The unprecedented national revenue of $87,000,000,000 will be $7,000,000,000 more than the most prosperous year, 1929. The national defense expenditure set by the President includes $3,447,000,000 for the Navy, $5,956,000,000 for the Army, $407,000,000 for various agencies including the Detective Bureau, and $1,000,000,000 for future appropriations. The President's budget book is thousands of pages long, listing various national defense expenditures in detail, to prevent opponents from criticizing him. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday replaced the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy and ordered all U.S. warships to prepare for full wartime readiness. The new Commander-in-Chief of the Navy is Rear Admiral Kimmel, replacing Admiral Richardson. Admiral Hepburn remains Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, and Admiral Andrews remains in command of the expanding Atlantic Fleet. Captain Knox said that the United States is currently reorganizing its fleet system. Captain Knox stated that this reorganization represents a "readjustment to reality." "We are currently gradually expanding our Atlantic Fleet to make it independent." He said that the strength of the Atlantic Fleet is also being considered for change, and its current strength is 125 warships. The U.S. fleet will henceforth be called the "U.S. Navy" and will be divided into three main groups: two fleets stationed in the Pacific and one stationed in the Atlantic. The "Pacific Fleet" will be stationed in Hawaii, and the commander of that fleet will also serve as commander-in-chief of the three major fleets. Admiral Richardson has been ordered to report to Captain Knox for certain undisclosed responsibilities. The Secretary of the Navy said that according to current decisions, this reorganization will not affect the routine fleet exercise plan in the Pacific in the spring. When President Roosevelt ordered all warships to prepare for full wartime strength, he authorized the Navy Department to increase personnel from 192,000 to 233,000. Captain Knox said that this increase in personnel also applies to naval reservists. He said that as the fleet gradually expands, it will increase again. All appointed warships are making preparations for full wartime strength. Knox announced that President Roosevelt's order will take effect on February 1, 1941. Rear Admiral Kimmel is 58 years old. Knox announced that he graduated from the Annapolis Naval Academy in 1904, and his two sons are also serving in the Navy. Kimmel was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1937. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Navy Secretary Knox said yesterday that the Navy Department plans to ask Congress to authorize the construction of 100 auxiliary ships such as submarines, patrol boats, minesweepers, and scout ships. When asked by reporters about the possibility of continuing to aid Britain with destroyers, Knox replied that he did not think the U.S. Navy could allocate any more destroyers without hindering the efficiency of the U.S. Navy. However, the final decision is not up to him. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Washington – It is expected in official circles that as a result of President Roosevelt's budget message, income tax and excess profits tax will be greatly increased immediately. Tax revenue will reach the highest peak in American history under the current budget process, but the President has proposed increasing taxes. The methods of increasing taxes will be left to Congress. Increases in gift tax and property tax are also expected. The budget also proposes increasing the number of detectives by 500 to deter espionage and sabotage. This team already has 1,500 people, which is the same number as during the last European war.

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt's proposed budget for 1942 emphasizes the defense of the Caribbean, but states that most of the emergency construction projects in the region have already been completed in previous budgets. The only new project in this budget is to improve the naval and air station on St. John's Island at a cost of $1,105,000. It is also planned to strengthen naval fortifications in Guantanamo with $170,000. As for the naval defense plan on Isla Grande, Puerto Rico, the air force aspects include $300,000 to expand the airfield, $255,000 to open additional airfields, $250,000 to expand business, and $2,000,000 to build residences for unmarried officers. The Army Department stated that the authorities will continue this new project, including the construction of bomb and gasoline warehouses at a cost of $1,021,000. The Army and Navy will build a dock near the Panama Canal in the Atlantic Ocean at a cost of $7,500,000 so that American ships can sail there for repairs without having to detour to Norfolk. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington – House Speaker Rayburn, a Democrat from Texas, yesterday consulted with Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to draft a new bill that would allow the United States to lend Britain hundreds of millions of dollars. President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to approve a huge budget for the coming year, totaling $17,585,000,000, and some in political circles predict that aid to Britain will require an additional $30 to $100 billion outside the domestic budget. Defense expenditure accounts for 62 percent of this budget. Yesterday, the President stated in his budget message that of the total of $28,000,000,000 allocated for national defense over three years, the distribution is $13,704,000,000 for the Army, $11,587,000,000 for the Navy, $1,902,000,000 for factory expansion, and $1,287,000,000 for other items. The Army's expenditure does not include the cost of building double locks for the Panama Canal or other items. This total amount can support the largest army of 1.4 million people and 300 warships in the United States during peacetime. The Army currently has 100,000 conscripts and 500,000 regular soldiers. Salaries alone require $11 billion, and food and supplies cost $1,781,901,000. Air Force personnel require $1,190,854,000. Among the various defense construction projects, there are ship repair docks, airfields, underground gasoline depots, bomb-proof ammunition depots, seaplane storage depots, aircraft runways, port projects, large-scale aircraft manufacturing, new automatic rifles, anti-aircraft guns, and large coastal artillery. There will also be a large number of Flying Fortresses equipped with bulletproof gasoline tanks and armored gunner seats. President Roosevelt also requested $250 million in emergency funds, the purpose of which was not specified in detail, but is likely for the construction of new bases in the Caribbean (leased from Britain).

<p>Washington – News yesterday that President Roosevelt's proposed bill to lease war materials to China, Britain, and Greece will be submitted to Congress within 48 hours. It is rumored that President Roosevelt will request Congress to expedite the handling of this bill. Sources familiar with the matter said that President Roosevelt may not request a specific amount of funds, but will make requests to Congress from time to time to allocate funds for the purpose of carrying out this procedure. It is understood that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to invite Secretary of State Hull and his staff to provide an insider's account of the European war and other world situations. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington – A draft bill granting the U.S. government greater power to lend ships, tanks, artillery, and aircraft to Britain and other democracies has been prepared and is expected to be submitted to Congress tomorrow. It is expected that both houses will consider this bill simultaneously. According to House Speaker Rayburn, the sooner this bill is passed, the better. It is rumored that this bill is a completely new bill and does not contain any amendments to the Neutrality Act. The $2,750,000,000 in funds requested by President Roosevelt in his message to Congress for U.S. defense purposes does not include aid to Britain, because the plans of various democracies to manufacture armaments have not yet been approved by Congress. However, President Roosevelt has stated that $2,500,000,000 will be needed in the next two years, and this amount will be increased as needed. Today, according to Washington news, the majority of the American people believe that the United States should give Britain all assistance except war. Therefore, they do not express surprise at President Roosevelt's huge budget of $4,375,000,000. Democratic leader Barkley said today that this budget is the minimum amount that the United States should spend on national defense. It is generally acknowledged that the majority of the increased expenditure will come from increased income tax. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>New York – Authoritative sources here revealed last night that since the start of the European war, Japan has directly imported almost one million barrels of oil from Mexico. It is said that these ships carrying oil may have been transferred to Germany under the Axis agreement. Before mid-November before the European war, Japan was unable to import kerosene from Mexico. However, in contradiction to this, Mexican oil began to flow into Japan. When Germany bombed London and Japan joined the Axis powers, the import of Mexican oil to Japan increased even more.

<h3 id="e8">The Evolving International Triad <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>All of the future will immediately impact the international situation. Although the origins are distant and the brewing has been long, in recent days, these trends have successively developed to the point of imminent explosion, becoming the three most noteworthy patterns of the current moment: First, Bulgaria is experiencing extreme pressure, both internally in its politics and externally in its neutrality, and it appears increasingly unable to maintain its original state. Second, the Thai government has declared a state of so-called war on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Third, the United States has, in effect, shed the cloak of neutrality, openly making a sharp and rapid advance on the international stage. None of these three are sudden or isolated events.</p>
<p>Regarding all the news about Bulgaria, sometimes it spreads rapidly, sometimes we recognize it, making it confusing and difficult to discern the truth. However, experience tells us that this is not fabricated out of nothing, but rather smoke indicating fire; not illusory, but a hint before exposure; not external disruption, but internal struggles to eliminate changes and promote transformations. In mid-November of last year, Bulgaria almost joined the German-Italian Axis after Hungary and Romania, due to overwhelming pressure. However, the Soviet Union expressed dissent, and the country pulled back from the brink. Five months have passed, and now Bulgaria is wavering again. Today, it is still difficult to understand who has won the struggle, or how the Soviet Union and Germany-Italy have positioned themselves in these five months. The Soviet Union's actions on the international stage are extremely clever, but the international community has determined that it is unwilling to fight with real strength, which has become its only weakness in dealing with the world. With this weakness, it is not difficult for international desperados to "exploit" it. It is not necessary to ask what choices the Bulgarian authorities will make, or how its people will support or oppose them. In short, if the changes cannot be eliminated and the original state is altered, the Balkans will immediately experience a great wave, which will initially affect the strategy between Greece and Italy, and then affect Turkey, Yugoslavia, and even the Soviet Union's neutrality.</p>
<p>Regarding Thailand and French Vietnam, diplomatic negotiations have turned into armed conflict. For months, the situation has sometimes eased slightly and sometimes become extremely tense. Assuming that yesterday's report that the Thai government declared a state of war on the Thai-Vietnamese border is accurate, then in terms of international law, it cannot be immediately regarded as a declaration of war, but it is very different from a silent armed conflict. It is not necessary to elaborate on how declaring a local state of war affects the rights and obligations of international third parties, but it must be seen as a trend towards formal war between Thailand and Vietnam, that is, with France. The problem is too complex and delicate. Thailand has shown various signs of colluding with Japan, and its own fragility and international interests cannot withstand any pressure from Britain and the United States. The Vietnamese authorities have declared their determination to resist. Once the fighting starts, the Vichy government will certainly not sit idly by, and General Catroux will certainly not condone Thailand. It is as if there is no quick knife that can solve the tangled mess, nor is it a dispute that countries with intertwined interests will allow to arise and perish on its own. So, who are Thailand's allies, who are French Vietnam's allies, and how will the international community divide itself in this dispute? Although chaos may be allowed in the initial stages, it will eventually become clear. The evolution is unlikely to be grasped by any party today. Relevant countries may not have time to participate in this matter today, but when a formal state of war is established, it will immediately become a serious issue that relevant countries must resolve.</p>
<p>As for the attitude of the United States, this newspaper already described it yesterday as having entered a new era. Last night, we learned that the U.S. authorities, in order to make the navy "meet the facts," have already reallocated it and are preparing for full wartime strength, dividing the entire naval force into three major fleets, one in the Atlantic and two in the Pacific, with the commander of the Pacific Fleet also serving as the commander-in-chief of the three major fleets. The world will surely be able to distinguish the weight and significance of this measure. In addition, we have learned that the bill to lease war materials to China, Britain, and Greece will quickly begin its journey in Congress. After the U.S. Congress passes President Roosevelt's military spending bill, the American people will bear a daily military expenditure of 48 million U.S. dollars; this is a greater number than what is paid by general belligerent countries. From the increasingly strong steps of the United States, showing a spirit of both sword and shoes, it is clear that the United States does not have the weakness of "unwilling to fight with real strength" in the international arena; and the remaining question of whether or not it will fight only asks whether the aggressor nations will provoke it!</p>
<p>Normally, reasoning about the above three patterns, each pattern's development is an extension of the world's war situation. Although we do not want to see the war situation expand, expansion cannot be stopped by will. Bulgaria is the easiest medium to cause the war situation to expand. As for the United States, taking the victory or defeat of China and Britain as its own victory or defeat is its wisest view; to support the war efforts of China, Britain, and Greece as a substitute for fighting itself is its wisest policy. For, by normal reasoning, if Germany cannot defeat Britain, it will never dare to provoke the United States; if Japan cannot defeat China, it will never dare to provoke the United States. Therefore, the United States only needs to vigorously support China and Britain, and it can avoid direct warfare. However, the two countries of Japan and Germany will eventually recognize that if they cannot overcome the United States, they will not be able to defeat China and Britain. Under this recognition, will they retreat when they know the situation, or will they take a risk and provoke the United States? The matter is unknowable, that is, the chances of peace and war are half and half. Moreover, if Thailand and Vietnam actually go to war, the consequences will affect the military strategic position of Singapore, the Philippines, and Burma. If this happens, the front line is getting closer and closer to the United States.</p>

<p>Lanzhou - According to front-line reports, the Japanese troops who crossed from Baotou to the west bank of the Yellow River to invade China were fiercely attacked by a certain Chinese unit. On the evening of the 31st, all the Japanese troops were defeated, and most of them crossed the river and fled back. Only a small part remains, and the Chinese army is encircling and annihilating them. (9th Dispatch) A Chinese military spokesman in Chongqing told reporters today that the Japanese troops around Xuzhou began to harass the Chinese forces on the northwest sides after adding a division. In the past week, the battles in central China have had no major significance and appear to be exploratory in nature, testing the Chinese military strength. The main area of activity is Tongcheng, south of Hankou, where two Japanese regiments attempted to advance south, and in the mountains west of Nanchang, Chinese positions were attacked. In Shandong Province, a Japanese regiment moved south from Jinan, but was ambushed, and the Chinese army killed hundreds of them. Other battles occurred on the railway line from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou, in areas south of the Yellow River, and in western Shanxi. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>A Certain Place in Western Sui - Since last month, the Japanese troops entrenched in western Sui have been restless from time to time. They have been attacked by Chinese forces many times. After the defeat, the Japanese once again invaded on December 28 of last year, with Wang Ying's troops as the vanguard, and are now confronting the Chinese army. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed a certain senior officer to understand the true situation of the battle. According to him, this time the Japanese sent more than 4,000 soldiers, dozens of artillery pieces, and several aircraft to cross the river and invade China in three routes. After being met by Chinese resistance, the Japanese did not succeed. In addition, the Japanese once again sent a mixed force to reinforce from Tangaimuduga (east of Wanxing West). They engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army in the areas of Wanxing West, Halahaozi (north of Wanxing West), Mao Bu La Gou (west of Six Points), and Six Points. Until 3 a.m. on the morning of the decision, the battle extended to Tangaimuduga, Baitu Liang, Wang Da Liang, and En Yibei (all southwest of Tangaimuduga).

<p>Chongqing - Zhang Jia'ao recently discussed the progress of the construction in the Greater Rear Area, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the setbacks and sacrifices we have endured are truly difficult to describe in detail. However, adversity builds a nation, as the ancient saying goes. I dare to respectfully inform the people of Shanghai that the progress of our Greater Rear Area's construction is advancing at an incredible speed, having established its foundation for new life and revival under the threat of Japanese artillery fire. We know that every nation in the world has its difficult and challenging historical stages, and its deep-rooted strength stems from the people's resolute determination to overcome all difficulties and turn danger into safety. Regarding the current situation of post-war construction, in terms of transportation, the main artery of the highway, stretching over ten thousand li from Yangon, across China from west to east and north to south, and to Moscow, has been completed. Travel and transportation are becoming more convenient day by day. Recently, I traveled to the Northwest and saw magnificent river fortresses along the way, with boundless resources and wealth waiting to be developed. It is truly felt that the great endowment to us is exceptionally generous. Major cities across the country can communicate via telephone and telegraph. During my trip to the Northwest, which lasted over a month and spanned five provinces, I could directly call Chongqing, the wartime capital, anytime and anywhere. Postal and telegraph services have been widely established even in remote areas. Railway construction has been vigorously pursued in recent years. Those under construction include the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, Dian-Mian, Xu-Kun, and Cheng-Yu railways. In terms of water transport, we are actively developing shipping routes and building our own ships. All plans that can enrich inland river transport are being comprehensively planned and implemented. In addition, the aviation network has been expanded, and post station transport is being promoted. In the past, people in Shanghai viewed the provinces in the Rear Area as extremely poor and suffering, with extremely inconvenient transportation. In fact, this general concept has become a thing of the past. The establishment of a new China is now in sight during this great era of resistance and construction, thanks to the power of national mobilization. I deeply believe that our compatriots residing on the isolated island of Shanghai, looking west to Sichuan and thinking of its vibrant and ever-changing situation, will have boundless emotion and excitement, and will roll up their sleeves and rise up, joining hands to embrace the motherland and work together on the great cause of resistance and construction. We, in light of the speed and magnitude of the progress in post-war construction promoted by the past three years of war, and looking ahead, feel that our responsibilities are even heavier and our efforts are endless. We can only strengthen our beliefs, implement our spirit, and, under the sole leadership of the supreme leader, prepare to move further, to endure the greater setbacks and costs that a newly emerging nation must inevitably face, to exhaust our sincerity, and to strive for the final victory of the war as soon as possible."

<p>— Zhen Lifu</p>
<p>In short, our country's life education integrates the cultivation of oneself in dealing with people and the world. From ancient times to the present, and even into the infinite future, it is consistently preserved in the soul of every individual. In times of urgency, it unleashes infinite brilliance. As Aeschylus said, "A person is only satisfied after dedicating himself to an event greater than himself." (J. Royee, Philosophy of Royalty). We Chinese have never easily let go of handling great events. The so-called "a scholar reveals his integrity in times of poverty" is an extremely valuable lesson left by countless benevolent and righteous people over thousands of years. Everything our youth are showing now is a replay of this lesson. Japan thinks it cannot be ignored and feels shocked, but for us, it is commonplace and not surprising at all.</p>
<p>With these lovely young people, what kind of result will occur for our future of resistance and construction? I think everyone already knows the answer in their hearts, and there is no need to describe it in detail. However, perhaps some people still suspect that I am making optimistic propaganda, so I must cite some facts to comfort the compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>First, the thoughts and actions of our youth now are more practical. The past problems of empty talk and fantasy have gradually decreased. Since the Japanese destroyed our cultural relics, our only response is to desperately build. The current achievements are naturally far from ideal, but in terms of the speed of progress, I believe that our central government's grand scale for building a new China can definitely be completed by the youth of today. There are two most obvious examples that can be used as a basis for speculation. One is that the majority of students now tend towards practical subjects in their learning aspirations. The following is a statistical table of the number of students admitted to public vocational schools and above in the past three years:</p>
<p>Also, the total number of applicants was 11,119 in the 27th year, 20,006 in the 28th year, and approximately over 20,000 in the 29th year. Why are there so many people entering engineering? Because the social need is great, which also shows the rapid advance of construction projects. It can be determined that the future prospects for students after graduation are not as difficult as before. During each graduation season, the Ministry of Education introduces all the graduates to various agencies according to their majors. However, the result is always that the demand exceeds the supply. The majority of graduates from many schools are snatched up before they are even introduced. The only difficulty we feel now is that the existing schools cannot fully accommodate students who are eager to enroll. Everyone unanimously sees that the construction industry will be greatly accelerated in the future, and the number of construction talents needed will be many times greater than it is now. Not only is this the case for engineering, but also for literature, law, commerce, and teacher training. Therefore, in the minds of general students, there is a very serious feeling, which is how to use their knowledge to gain social status. Thus, a practical and hardworking atmosphere is unconsciously developed. Even under the constant threat of air raids, people are still attending classes and studying in air raid shelters.

<p>Japanese Small Warships to Sail to Hanoi</p>
<p>Hanoi - Well-informed sources close to Japanese officials stated yesterday that several Japanese small warships will sail up the Red River to Hanoi on Monday. These sources stated that the reason for the Japanese warships to enter Hanoi is to provide military support for the Franco-Japanese negotiations currently underway in Tokyo. At the same time, Japan attempted to transport a batch of tanks, troops, and artillery from Haiphong to Hanoi on Tuesday, but the French refused to allow the vehicles to enter Hanoi. They are currently piled up in the suburbs of Hanoi. Informed sources stated that the military supplies were not intended to be transported to the Chinese border, but are related to the Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. (9th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Thai and Vietnamese Aircraft Bomb Each Other</p>
<p>Saigon - Today, Saigon Radio broadcast news stating that Thai aircraft had bombed Sisophon and another border city in Cambodia, killing two and injuring eleven. In addition, Thai troops launched a surprise attack. On the evening of January 7, French aircraft bombed several locations in Thailand in retaliation. Reports from Bangkok that Thai troops had invaded 15 miles into Vietnam and that French troops had retreated are all unfounded. Thai reconnaissance teams have occasionally crossed into French territory and attempted to incite the natives, but once they come into contact with French troops, they flee back to Thailand. It is reported that Vietnamese French officials are quite interested in the messages broadcast by Bangkok, stating that the Thai government does not want to cause difficulties for both sides. It has been pointed out that the statement in Bangkok Radio seems to contradict the actions of the Thai military. The increasingly rampant behavior of the Thai military seems likely to provoke severe retaliation from the Vietnamese side, but the general public still believes that the situation is not completely hopeless. If the Bangkok authorities declare that Thai troops will cease all hostile actions on a certain day and time, the French side will also adopt the same attitude of ceasing retaliation. Such a method will surely create a more harmonious atmosphere. When someone asked Vietnamese officials about this matter, they all refused to express an opinion, only saying that the hostile actions of the Thai side have forced them to take appropriate measures. The evolution of these measures will depend entirely on the events that occur and the attitude of Bangkok. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Bangkok - Thai military officials declared that after 30 Thai aircraft continuously bombed on January 6, they forced the Vietnamese army to retreat in panic from Poipet in Cambodia to Sisophon.

<p>Budapest - Hungarian newspapers yesterday prominently published news from the capital cities of Bulgaria and Romania stating that the situation within Romania is gradually becoming unstable. The news states that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu was forced to arrest several radical members of the Iron Guard in order to maintain his own power. It is reported that the radical elements of the Iron Guard insisted that Antonescu quickly reorganize the cabinet, causing the general situation in the Romanian capital to become tense. Many residents of the Romanian capital who are able to move have already moved out of the city, as they fear that this conflict will escalate into street fighting or other riots. (9th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest - It is rumored that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov intends to resign after returning to the Bulgarian capital from a visit to Vienna. As a result, the Balkan situation became increasingly tense last night, fearing that the war would soon extend to the Balkans. It is rumored that the situation in Romania is becoming more critical due to the Iron Guard's declaration of war on General Antonescu. It is also rumored that Germany intends to take severe measures to oppose the Soviet Union's sudden actions against Romania. Furthermore, it is rumored that an increasing number of German and Soviet troops are now confronting each other on the Soviet-Romanian border. The entry of German troops into Bulgaria was expected by most people, but it did not materialize yesterday. Diplomatic circles still have divided opinions on this issue. Some believe that this rumor was spread by the Germans to divert attention from other actions, while others insist that the military action of German troops entering Bulgaria will still arrive on time. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov refused to comment on his visit to Vienna. Filov also denied the news that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had handed him an ultimatum demanding that German troops enter Bulgaria, and that he had accepted the ultimatum. As for the rumor that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has concentrated outside Bulgarian ports, this matter remains mysterious and unpredictable. (9th International Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Senior naval circles claimed yesterday that a Soviet warship squadron, approximately nine ships, was severely warned by Romanian warships not to approach.</p>

<p>Bulgarian Capital - Interior Minister Gabrovski announced that all regions are maintaining a calm and normal state. The police have been ordered to severely punish those who spread rumors, distribute pamphlets, and engage in various activities that endanger the country. Large-scale demonstrations will be held in various regions in the coming days. Cabinet Prime Minister Filov and other cabinet members will deliver speeches on the current situation. (9th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, rumors have been rife in recent days. After repeated denials by the authorities of the countries concerned, the situation has become clearer. What has been clarified is that the King of Bulgaria did not go to Berlin. Although the Bulgarian Cabinet Prime Minister Filov went to Vienna, it has not yet been confirmed that he met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The Soviet Union's recall of its envoys to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, and the two statements of German troops entering Bulgaria, have also been proven untrue. Romanian telephone and telegraph communications were interrupted for a time, but have been restored. As for German-Soviet relations, only the issue of navigation management on the Danube River remains to be resolved. The International Commission for the Management of Navigation on the Danube River closed last month without reaching an agreement. According to the Soviet Union, navigation on the lower reaches of the Danube River should be jointly managed by the Soviet Union and Romania. The commission is scheduled to reconvene this month to discuss this matter. In addition, the Turkish Foreign Minister delivered a speech a few days ago, forcefully stating that the country's foreign policy is purely defensive in nature and has not changed. The Turkish President's visit to the Slesvig district to inspect defenses also has no significant meaning. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Swiss City - The correspondent of the Swiss Basel City News in Berlin recently reported that the Soviet Union and Germany have been conducting business negotiations in Moscow for two months. They have recently signed a protocol to extend the effective period of the current business agreement by 18 months, until August 1, 1942. It is still difficult to know what changes will occur in German-Soviet business relations after that. In general, the two sides will increase the amount of certain goods exchanged within the current trade scope, but the total trade volume may not increase. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>London - Reuters correspondent telegraphed from British headquarters in Cairo: the Italian garrison in Tobruk may not receive more reinforcements, and their situation is becoming more serious. British aircraft reconnaissance in the Tobruk area did not see Italian troop movements. British empire forces are gradually approaching Tobruk City. The British headquarters in Cairo is now unwilling to comment on the nature of British progress. However, they know that the British forces are making progress that makes the commander "extremely satisfied". Officials recently disclosed that three commanders of the Italian Blackshirt Legion abandoned their troops and fled overnight before the fall of Bardia, indicating that the morale of the Italian army led by General Graziani, the commander of the Italian army in Libya, has completely disintegrated. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British military spokesperson stated that the number of British tanks, armored vehicles, and infantry concentrated in the Tobruk area is increasing daily. However, there is still one way for the Italian army to retreat, which is to follow the coast to Derna, 75 miles west. There is currently no sign that the Italian army is withdrawing from Tobruk. Furthermore, a senior official of the British Air Force stated that the continued arrival of Royal Air Force aircraft to the front line is not as rapid as it was two and a half months ago. The Italian army can obtain assistance from Germany, and our future will be very difficult. However, our hope of success is greater than it was two and a half months ago. Since the British Air Force in the Middle East began fighting with Italy, it has shot down 500 Italian aircraft and carried out 2,000 air raids on various parts of Italy. The British aircraft losses are less than 100 aircraft. (9th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>British Headquarters - According to reliable military intelligence last night, the Italian high command has abandoned Tobruk, allowing it to be besieged and even lost.

However, it admitted that British aircraft again heavily bombed Tripoli, with four Italians dead and at least ten injured. The Italian communiqué also stated that three British aircraft were shot down. (9th International Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo - Tobruk has been completely surrounded by Allied forces, and its defense works are now under the artillery fire of the British vanguard. It is reported that there are very few Italian defenders active, and there is no sign of external reinforcements arriving. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Gong Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store Manager Kidnapped.</p>
<p>Gong Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store, located at 1212-1213 Haig Road in the Shanghai West, a two-story building, is owned by Ningbo native Ye Deben (50 years old), who also serves as the manager. Yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM, while Ye Deben was personally supervising the store staff in organizing fabrics, four kidnappers suddenly appeared. One stood guard outside the door, while two dressed in blue worker's uniforms and one in a yellow overcoat rushed in. They approached Ye, and all three drew pistols, ordering him not to make a sound. Two kidnappers restrained Ye, while the other took out a pre-prepared rope and tied his hands behind his back. Seeing the pistols, Ye did not resist and allowed the kidnappers to do as they pleased.

<p>German Resident's Residence Burglarized, Thief Escorted from Hangzhou to Shanghai. Chinese Servant Steals Jewelry and Flees to Hangzhou, Arrested in Hangzhou by Japanese Military Police and Escorted to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the English "North China Daily Mail," with the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police, the Public Concession police have arrested a Chinese thief in Hangzhou who had been wanted for three weeks.

<p>Head Landlord Colludes with Third-Party Tenants to Sue Second-Party Tenant for Eviction. Third-Party Tenants Offer to Rent Premises Directly from Head Landlord. Appeals Against Tai Dan Egg Company Heard Yesterday.</p>
<p>He Xing Real Estate Company, located at 444 Beijing Road, constructed residences at No. 612, Di Die Lane, and several street-facing shops along Tiantong Road before the "August 13th" Incident. Egg merchant Dai Huaiqin, wanting to open an egg shop there, paid a gratuity of 3,600 yuan and a deposit of 320 yuan to rent five interconnected shikumen houses from the real estate company at Nos. 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road and No. 9 inside Lane 612. Construction of these houses was halted due to the Shanghai War and resumed when the war shifted westward, finally completing in January of the Republic of China year 27 (1938). At that time, due to a shortage of eggs, Dai Huaiqin only opened the Xing Tai Egg Company at No. 628 Tiantong Road on February 1st of the same year, using No. 9 in the lane as a residence. Although Dai Huaiqin rented the street-facing shops at Nos. 624 and 626 Tiantong Road, she sub-rented them, through the introduction of a rent collector from He Xing Real Estate Company, to Huang Kecheng, owner of the Little Luzon Hat Shop on Fourth Avenue, to operate the Standard Coal Briquette Factory. Dai Huaiqin had spent over 5,000 yuan on gratuities, deposits, and renovations when renting the premises, so she sub-rented to Huang Kecheng for 100 yuan per month (including taxes), with a fixed term of one year. Dai Huaiqin's lease with He Xing Real Estate Company was an indefinite lease. The lease agreements were effective from February of the Republic of China year 27 (1938). Huang Kecheng's Standard Coal Briquette Factory also opened in February of the same year. Later, Dai Huaiqin, finding the original location insufficient, wanted to reclaim the premises sub-rented to Huang Kecheng for her own use. Although the lease had expired, Huang Kecheng refused to move out. After legal proceedings, the two parties reached a settlement, but Huang Kecheng still did not move out by the end of April of last year. Dai Huaiqin had no choice but to sue Huang Kecheng. Huang Kecheng lost the lawsuit and then offered to rent the premises directly from He Xing Real Estate Company. He Xing Real Estate Company then sued Dai Huaiqin for eviction, claiming that the lease term was two years. However, the court found that the lease agreement had been altered, so He Xing Real Estate Company lost again. Later, He Xing Real Estate Company filed another petition with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting an order for Dai Huaiqin's eviction, arguing that Dai Huaiqin had sublet the entire premises and invited the third-party tenant Huang Kecheng and others to testify. The original trial ruled against Dai Huaiqin. Dai, dissatisfied with the ruling, recently hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Jia held a hearing to investigate. The appellant, Dai Huaiqin, and her lawyer insisted that the appellant had leased street-facing shops at Nos. 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road and a two-bay residence at No. 9 in Lane 612 from the appellee, He Xing Real Estate Company. Except for the sub-rental of Nos. 624 and 626, the appellant used all the remaining premises and never sublet the entire premises. There was no provision in the lease agreement prohibiting sub-rental. Furthermore, in August of the Republic of China year 27 (1938), the appellee was notified by registered mail about the third-party tenants building a mezzanine. The appellee never objected. How can they now claim ignorance of the appellant's sub-rental of the premises? The court also questioned the appellee's side and announced a postponement for further hearings.</p>

<p>French Police Raid Yesterday, Busting a Gang Stealing and Reselling Fabrics, Seizing Over Five Hundred Bolts of Stolen Fabric.</p>
<p>French Police Chief Inspector Li Xianyang, along with Inspectors Lü Zhuke, Dai Rongyan, Detectives Zhang Dongcheng, Tan Yangsheng, He Xiaopei, and others, learned that a gang of thieves had established an organization in Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, specializing in stealing fabrics. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, they went to raid the area. At Nos. 35 and 36 of the lane, they arrested five men and three women, including the thief Sun Xuedao, and seized over thirty bolts of fabric in the kitchen, taking them all back to the police station. Subsequently, based on the confessions of the suspects, they rushed to No. 6 Dexing Lane, Baliliqiao Street, and arrested three Anhui natives, including Long Zhenxing (38 years old), seizing over five hundred bolts of stolen fabric, worth over 10,000 yuan. After investigation, the police learned that the fabrics were all from the Hengfeng Fabric Factory. The factory had, a few days ago, dispatched a truck fully loaded with fabrics to the Taikoo Wharf, when the gang of thieves took the opportunity to steal them.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the Hengfeng Company on Sichuan Road, No. 126 Alley in the English Concession, had recently reported the theft of a large quantity of fabrics, valued at over 10,000 yuan, to the Public Concession police, requesting an investigation. The French Concession police have now discovered that the gang of thieves involved in this case were hiding at No. 35 Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road. They rushed to the address the night before last and arrested a person named Shen and seized over twenty bolts of stolen fabric. According to Shen's confession, the mastermind, Long Zhengxing, resided at No. 36 Kunlin Lane. The detectives then arrested Long and eleven other accomplices and seized an additional fifty or so bolts of stolen fabric, totaling twelve suspects and the stolen goods. After investigation, Long Zhengxing confessed to masterminding the theft, and Shen and the other eleven also confessed to participating in the theft, admitting that several other accomplices were still at large. The detectives reported this information to the head of the police, who, considering that the crime occurred within the English Concession, ordered the twelve suspects and all the stolen goods to be transferred to the Central Police Station of the English Concession for further investigation, to pursue the remaining accomplices and send them to the First Special District Court for prosecution.</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance: Bank of China to Sell US Dollars This Month.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American currencies was very quiet throughout the day. The trend in the afternoon session was already loose, due to the Bank of China's heavy selling of US dollars for this month at 5.5625. Speculators were no longer active. Later, banks and other institutions absorbed some, and supply and demand gradually balanced out. The market became even more quiet, with sparse trading. The closing price for British gold was 3 shillings 5 and 15625/100000, and the US dollar was 5 yuan and 5625/10000. Compared with the day before yesterday, the British gold was firmer by 0.015625 and the US dollar by 0.03125.</p>

<p>Swap Gradually Approaching, Gold Market Spot and Futures Converging.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was erratic and sluggish. The rise and fall were suddenly narrow. The trend continued to be flat and weak. The price had fallen below 6,400 yuan and revolved around 6,367 yuan all day. The reason was that the current swap was gradually approaching, and many were starting to close out. Furthermore, foreign exchange continued to be firm, and people's hearts were weak. In the middle, HSBC bought US dollars for this month at 5 yuan 5625/10000, and the securities firm Detefu poured in, once flying from 6,350 yuan to 6,398 yuan. However, another securities firm, Xinyuan, repeatedly sold out. From noon onwards, it became weak again. In the early afternoon, the low price of the day was seen again. Later, it rose slightly and finally closed at 6,372 yuan, a small squeeze of 30 yuan. Calculated by the US dollar one-month forward price of 5 yuan 5625/10000, the settlement price was 6,291 yuan, a lift of 11 yuan. The total transaction for the day was 6,700 silver. In the morning, a cash transaction of 150 taels was sold by a Yu firm to two other gold firms, at a price 17-18 yuan lower than the forward transaction. In the afternoon, gold firms made mutual transactions of several hundred taels, 15 yuan lower. The price continued to converge. Gold ornaments, Customs gold, etc. remained flat.</p>

<p>"Haxia Chi" Drops Another 30 Yuan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the selling voices on the trading floor were loud, and the opening price was lowered by more than 40 yuan. It is estimated that the silver firms first made 20 taels, for 6,360 yuan. Before long, small money shops and silver firms bought slightly, and within a few minutes, it rose back by more than 20 yuan. It is estimated that the money exchange industry entered the securities firm for 30 taels, at 6,385 yuan. Later, due to the slight increase in foreign exchange, people's hearts were tired, and there was a lack of maintenance. It was suppressed by more than 30 yuan. It is estimated that the silver firm made 20 taels, at 6,350 yuan. Because the securities firm and the money exchange industry were willing to buy cheaply, it was eventually raised, reaching the 400 yuan level. It is estimated that the securities firm entered the silver firm for 20 taels, at 6,398 yuan. Until before the close, a certain account of the securities firm came out again and dropped to 6,365 yuan. The gold firm closed 10 taels to the silver firm at noon, stabilizing the closing price at 6,372 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was also flat. It is estimated that the securities firm sold 10 taels to the silver firm, reporting 6,365 yuan. Following that, the securities firm sold more and more vigorously, continuing to fall by ten yuan. It is estimated that the money exchange industry entered the securities firm for 20 taels, at 6,350 yuan. However, the silver firms and small money shops, seeing the low price, immediately developed a buying intention, which was raised to 6,380 yuan. Finally, as the foreign exchange changed little, the securities firms sold again, dropping to 6,372 yuan at the close, a squeeze of 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The rise and fall for the day were 48 yuan. The price of the company's gold cards and "Haxia Chi" were the same. Receiving at a low of 40 yuan, the current standard gold price was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There were few open transactions.</p>

<p>There is No Change in Gold Ornaments.</p>
<p>The price of silver ornaments from silver shops remained unchanged. It is estimated that Da Tonghang, Xin Tonghang, and others still hung at 650 yuan, and the receiving price was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Foreign Currencies Decline Slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the "Haxia Chi" market sentiment, hovered and trended lower. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan. British gold tickets remained flat, and the market price stood still. The American gold tickets followed the downward trend, once retreating to 17 yuan and 8 jiao 6 fen, and finally to 17 yuan and 9 jiao, a squeeze of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets fell and then returned to flat. Japanese gold tickets had even supply and demand, and the market price stood still. The evening market still stood at 1 yuan 6 jiao on the original price. Korean tickets trended lower again, retreating to 1 yuan 2 jiao in the evening market.</p>

<p>Food: Imported "Yang Qiao" Rice Gradually Comes Under Control Yesterday. Most Rice is Already Above the Price Limit. Japonica Rice Also Falls Back Two Yuan Plus.</p>
<p>Rice brokers, after being ordered to suspend entry for two weeks, yesterday completed their term and resumed trading. These brokers, having been warned, now have a stricter association organization, and management methods all comply with regulations. They refuse all improper trading on commission and will immediately report it, so it is difficult for general hoarding households to cause trouble. Moreover, the concession authorities have started to thoroughly investigate inventories, which makes them uneasy. Therefore, with this shallow hope, they have successively released the large quantities of inventory that they were previously unwilling to release, "breaking the silence of the past month and becoming lively." Saigon No. 1 and 2, and Siam No. 3, which have long been unseen, opened early. Not only were they related to the scarcity of goods, but they were still set at the follow-up price, with the new evaluation having already limited it to a one-yuan decrease. Therefore, from the high of 77 yuan to the low of 74 yuan, rice, mung beans, broken rice, and polished rice have also been evaluated at a two-yuan decrease. Tea rice opened at 75 yuan, broken rice high from 72 yuan and 70 yuan, settled at 69 yuan, Tokyo polished pointed rice at 76 yuan and a half, down two or three yuan from the previous market. If we look at the black market, the premium price for the previous hoarding has depreciated by four or five yuan, which is truly a good sign that the rice market has not seen in recent months. The reason for this severe drop is that the shipments scheduled for both the morning and the evening are too many, and people's hearts have already become weak. In addition, the Rice Company Association was assigned to supply 30,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 to the industry, which has already oversupplied. Furthermore, after the brokers resumed their presence, they frantically promoted sales to store customers, and the floating households who profited were willing to sell. Therefore, the high prices of all kinds of rice plummeted in unison. Then, because there was news in the market that the Thai-Vietnamese war was expanding, the market began to stabilize. The selling prices of various kinds of rice are still on the price limit line. Small twists and broken rice are sold within the new evaluation. The return cargo has seen a sharp drop. Small twist, December 9th loaded, small bag 88-89 yuan. New transactions included Heyi Saigon No. 1, February, 90 yuan 02 jiao, totaling 1,000 tons. Shenji Small twist, 7,500 tons, January 15th loading, was 82 yuan 78 jiao, with 300 tons of returned original bags transacted.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice, in this environment where sales are sluggish and selling intentions are loose, the market follows the imported rice and falls by more than two yuan. It is estimated that Kunshan Hu's white japonica saw 103 yuan to 100 yuan, Qingjiao Hu's thin rice saw 97-8 yuan, high 99 yuan, original bag 102 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Jihe Foreign Company's Fuluxun ship arrived with 2,209 bags from Hong Kong, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu) The price of flour has fallen slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e44">麵粉 <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Flour. Yesterday's imported flour market saw a slight decline, probably because the drop in rice prices had some impact on the current flour sales. Local customers and entrants all intended to wait for an opportunity to buy again. Wild Boar and Beautiful Brand imported flour were held back with little trading. Only Flower Bird Clock Tower flour was slightly favored by the local market, with less than 5,000 bags transacted. Clock Tower Brand declined from 24 yuan, 3 jiao and a half to 24 yuan. Flower Bird Brand has secretly loosened to within 24 yuan. The situation is quite soft. However, in the afternoon, news spread that the Thai-Vietnamese situation was beneficial, and people's hearts returned to stability. Plain-priced flour was still sold at 21 yuan and 5 jiao, plus 3 jiao for other miscellaneous expenses, with 3,000 bags supplied by the two factories.</p>
<p>Imported flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, another 7,200 bags were imported by the Jihe Foreign Company's Fuluxun ship from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat trading remained in a state of stalemate. Because the current inventory is exhausted, the owners are trying to raise prices, and the factories are unwilling to lower prices to buy again because they want to buy goods without any. Therefore, both sides are still mutually holding back. It is heard that the Japanese factories have slightly received some retail purchases, at a price of 29 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>Oilcake: Soybean Cake Speculation, Transactions Rampant.</p>
<p>In recent days, soybean cake speculation and transactions have been quite rampant. Rice and oil worms are all frightened by it, using it as a tool for bulls and bears. Yesterday, Changzhou Feizi brand cakes were sold for delivery in the first half of January for three vehicles, Chayuan Long cakes for seven vehicles, and Xingji cakes for 8,000 pieces. Lizi brand cakes were sold for delivery in March for 5,000 pieces. As a result of the competition between the two sides, the sellers had a slight advantage, and the market price was down two or three jiao from before.</p>

<p>Securities: Government Bonds Market Situation Rises and Falls Sharply, Resulting in More Rises Than Falls.</p>
<p>The government bond black market had a very turbulent situation yesterday, rising and falling sharply, with a difference of about one yuan in the high and low, which seemed to indicate a change. Whether this will cause a turnaround is not necessarily certain, but at least there will be no drastic decline. It is inevitable that bulls will be too crowded and come out when prices are high, because the increase since the New Year has been as high as four or five yuan. It is not very easy to reach 70 yuan in one fell swoop. Even if it can be reached, it will inevitably go through several detours and gradually reach its destination. An overly rapid advance will inevitably suffer setbacks, which is the norm of things. There are no major flaws in the environment, but the trading floor is gradually reaching a saturation point, and only absorbing without releasing is only a minority. The transactions yesterday by the two firms, Xinfu and Tongkang, still adhered to their consistent style, continuously absorbing in the morning and afternoon, but Lemao and No. 16 sold out at high prices, and various firms saw very active sellers following suit. For a time, the high and low prices differed by about one yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was the one quoted by the Wantai Firm, which was 68 yuan and 9 jiao, a new high price. For a time, selling accounts rose up like bees and declined in a straight line, closing at the lowest price of the afternoon. However, the result was still a rise of one or two jiao compared to the previous day. Type A, on the other hand, fell by a small two jiao. Type D rose by 7 jiao in the afternoon due to rice trading. The total number of transactions was 3.56 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded, at a price of 9 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market had a large rise and fall throughout the day, with sellers having a relatively large advantage, but at the close, short positions rose again to cover, and at the same time, new investors were also active. The underlying potential was still good. The dramatic changes in the market situation were caused by various rumors. There were extremely many transactions. Rubber stocks and industrial stocks lacked progress.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch. Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British companies' stocks were all flat and sluggish, and the market situation generally remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: The End of the Year is Approaching, the Yarn Market Feels Quiet.</p>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of uncertainty, but the trend is more stable. As a result, the range of rise and fall is within ten yuan. Because of the relationship between the lunar year and the approaching end of the year, both the long and short sides are preparing to wait for the spring to decide the outcome, so the market trading is not as prosperous as it used to be. As for the actual demand, it is even more idle. The highest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn once saw 1,358 yuan, and the low was 1,345 yuan. The afternoon market was calm, starting at 1,355 yuan, then 1,352 yuan. Transactions were few.</p>
<p>The opening market situation of Double Horse was flat in the morning, and the atmosphere was friendly, but the psychology of the public opened high and tended to sell. The opening price was 1,355 yuan. At this time, the market was not tight, and the hat-snatching orders and floating longs probably sold out. At the same time, there was not much change in foreign exchange, and the market gradually fell to 1,345 yuan. The price was slightly weak, and sellers were not strong. Shorts profited and covered, and it was rumored that the price of gold had risen slightly. The situation suddenly became tense, and it suddenly rose to 1,358 yuan. However, the current sales were not strong, and the closing price saw a setback of several yuan, to 1,353 yuan. It is estimated that the half-day transaction statistics were 5,760 bales. The market situation of 20-count Double Horse yarn had no major changes. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows.</p>
<p>Same trade 5,600, Hong Kong 130, Ningbo 30. Statistics 5,760.</p>

<p>Cotton Market Also Unchanged.</p>
<p>The current cotton situation has no great ups and downs to distinguish. This is because the end of the year is approaching, so the factories' needs are still not developing. However, the flower companies have slightly made some mutual purchases and decorations. However, the market price has not changed much. Yesterday, 41 bales of cotton came from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is active. First, because of purchases from the same industry, and then because of the increase in domestic raw cotton consumption, and the good spot transactions, the closing price was more than ten pounds higher than the previous day, up to more than twenty pounds. India's quick forecast also rose by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has continued to be exceptionally quiet in recent days. The purchases from all parties are very weak, and the transactions in the same industry are also rare. All are holding a wait-and-see attitude.</p>

<p>Piece Goods: Although Actual Sales Are Clear, Factory Prices Are Not Cheap.</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly higher, because although actual sales were clear, the same trade and customer gangs were very lively in their transactions. The cheap inventory on the market gradually cleared. This was because the factory prices were not cheap, and people's hearts were determined. The selling market was generally flat. Some of the scarce goods rose by one or two jiao per bolt. The Shui Street traded more than 600 pieces of various fabrics, Zhejiang-Fujian gang handled more than 200 pieces of dyed cloth, pongee, and coarse and fine cloth, Guangdong-Hong Kong gang handled more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and the Nanyang gang handled more than 5,000 bolts of bleached cloth, khaki, etc.</p>

<p>Athens: A Royal Air Force communique states that British aircraft bravely braved heavy rain and snow to effectively bomb the Italian command headquarters and military depots in Elbasan, the central location of Italian command in Albania. High-explosive and incendiary bombs continuously rained down on the military buildings, causing numerous large fires. All British aircraft returned safely after completing their mission. It is also reported that several squadrons of Italian low-flying bombers and fighter planes were deployed yesterday, attempting to impede the advance of the Greek army on all fronts. However, the fiercely brave and skilled Greek Evzones, mountain cavalry, and other infantry continued their fierce fighting without pause. A Greek official spokesman stated that the operations of the Greek forward posts have consistently achieved satisfactory results and that the Greek army continues to maintain its dominant position. The spokesman also said that according to various reports received by the Greek command, the fighting in the central Këlcyrë area is fierce, and many Italian troops have been captured in the northern region. The spokesman denied reports of Italian troops repelling the Greek army's attack on the Pogradec area, stating that Italian troops were repelled by the Greek army while counter-attacking the advancing Greek troops, leaving twenty corpses on the battlefield and fleeing. The spokesman continued, stating that the Italian troops in a certain area along the coast north of Sarandë have been completely cleared. Italian troops were unable to escape and were all captured by the Greek army. In addition, the Greek army has also occupied important and heavily fortified positions in the mountains of Mokra. Furthermore, a Greek army communique stated, "In local battles, our army has captured 300 Italian troops and countless military supplies, including many automatic rifles and mortars. Our air force has also bombed the enemy and strafed them with machine guns, shooting down three Italian planes. Our air force returned safely to base after the operations." Also, a Ministry of Public Security communique stated that Italian aircraft bombed Thessaloniki in northeastern Greece, but there were no casualties and the damage was not significant. A correspondent from the United Press accompanying the Italian troops in the Mokra Mountains reported that the fascist army is now using new heavy artillery capable of firing sixteen miles on railways, hoping to counter-attack and expand its activities (United Press dispatch on the 9th). Athens: Athens Radio reports that 35,000 Italian troops boarded ships from Vlorë yesterday, indicating that the Italian situation is very discouraging. From Pogradec to the coastal area, Greek troops are making steady progress without resistance. Between Tepelenë and Këlcyrë, Greek troops have made some new gains, and the Italian troops in that area are in dire straits (United Press dispatch on the 9th). Vichy: According to a report from a French Times correspondent stationed on the Italian border, the Italian side has dispatched reinforcements, transporting them by sea and air across the Strait of Otranto to Albania (Reuters dispatch on the 9th).</p>

<h3 id="e52">Strong Consciousness Among People in Free China Areas; Unprecedented Unity and Solidarity; Astonishing Developments in Various Constructions; Mr. Fei, Returned from a Tour, Gave a Speech at the Rotary Club Yesterday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Fei, a Western staff member of the YMCA, recently returned to Shanghai from Free China. Yesterday, he gave a speech at the local Rotary Club, sharing his observations. He stated that he had witnessed astonishing progress in Free China, which was due to the continuous striving of the people. Therefore, he did not believe that any other country in the world could demonstrate better results than China.</p>
<p>Building a Railway in Sixty Days</p>
<p>Mr. Fei visited Kunming twice, once three years ago when he only saw one yarn factory there. When he returned to Kunming a year later, he found the place vibrant and completely different from before. There were no fewer than thirty-six large-scale factories, and many more were under construction. Mr. Fei went on to say that similar progress could be seen in other areas of Free China. The railway system between important cities was particularly developed. One railway, 137 miles long, was completed in just sixty days. People often say that Easterners work slowly, but based on what he has seen, this is actually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Unity and Solidarity</p>
<p>Mr. Fei then recounted his experiences of fleeing during Japanese bombing raids. When he traveled from Hong Kong to the mainland, he traveled secretly at night every day to avoid Japanese air raids. Although Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc everywhere, the people were determined, encouraging and urging each other on. He repeatedly heard people express their determination to persevere to the end, and he never saw anyone complaining. This was truly amazing. Mr. Fei said that he felt fortunate to witness the birth of a new China. Although there were rumors of various factional divisions, in reality, China's current unity and solidarity are unprecedented in history. He stated that this war is actually a blessing for China. Things that would have taken China several generations (thirty years being a generation) to achieve in peacetime are now being accomplished in three years.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Aircraft Fuel and Gasoline</p>
<p>After Mr. Fei finished his speech, he told reporters that he believed China's greatest needs at the moment are transport vehicles, gasoline, fighter planes, and bombers. He said that the main reason for rising prices in China is the lack of adequate transportation facilities. Mr. Fei also told his fellow Rotarians that he had traveled extensively in the past three years to various provinces of China, as well as Annam, Siam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and the United States. He said that the American people are very different from before. Previously, those who sympathized with isolationists accounted for nearly 80 percent, but now the entire country unanimously supports the government's policy of assisting democratic countries. Public opinion is even more advanced than the government on this point.</p>

<p>After the trolley workers accepted advice and agreed to resume work first while waiting for a legal solution, the labor side immediately dispatched staff to notify the workers the day before yesterday. As a result, machine workers and traffic workers all entered the factory to resume work at six o'clock yesterday morning, according to the company's scheduled shifts. At the same time, the Traffic Department dispatched personnel to schedule vehicles and prepare to restore trolley service. By eight o'clock yesterday morning, trolleys on all routes had completely left the factory and resumed operation. However, trackless trolleys on all routes were not fully restored until around nine o'clock. As for the trams in the British and French concessions, they also resumed mutual service.</p>
<p>Traffic Restored, Precautions Lifted</p>
<p>The various temporary police precautions at the general office of the trolley company on North Suzhou Road, as well as the Jing'an Temple Station on Hardoon Road and the general materials depot on Route Doumer, were lifted immediately after the workers resumed work. The barbed wire and other barricades in front of Jing'an Temple Station have been removed. After the trolleys and trackless trolleys in the International Settlement completely left the factory and resumed operation, public transport within the Settlement was fully restored. Public buses have suspended the addition of vehicles on various public bus routes. Shanghai citizens, seeing that the trolley services have been restored, all hope that both labor and management should embrace a spirit of cooperation to seek reasonable improvements in workers' treatment. The workers' strike and suspension of trolley services have a profound impact on traffic.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Consult to Resolve Conditions</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the workers' side yesterday that regarding the conditions put forward by the workers, in addition to the second condition regarding year-end bonuses and special bonuses which has been negotiated and resolved, and the fifth condition that the company agreed to increase ticket sellers on trackless trolley routes 14 and 15, the remaining conditions including the first condition of increasing wages by 50 percent, the third condition that drivers, coppersmiths, and ticket sellers would receive wage increases every four days, and the fourth condition that the company would deduct the welfare contributions payable to the union when paying workers' wages, have been submitted to the board of directors for review. Further open negotiations will be held to resolve the issues. It is heard that the company is making every effort to improve workers' treatment so that they can maintain their current livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Shanghai's Savings for Nation-Building Exceed 10 Million Yuan; Ranking Third in the Country; Headquarters Has Telegraphed Encouragement to the Promotion Agencies; Principal and Interest of the Savings Are Extremely Safe and Generous <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Since the National General Association for Savings for Nation-Building launched the savings for nation-building campaign, all regions have responded and promoted it enthusiastically. All provinces and cities across the country, as well as government and commercial banks and postal remittance bureaus, have accepted savings for nation-building. The four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) and provincial and municipal banks, postal remittance bureaus, etc., have issued savings bonds for the campaign with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The total amount of savings stored nationwide last year has exceeded the predetermined amount of 200 million yuan. Regarding the isolated island of Shanghai, although savings bonds for nation-building are temporarily not publicly sold due to the special circumstances, various banks have agreed to purchase savings bonds from Hong Kong on behalf of customers and handle savings for nation-building. The citizens of the isolated island have spared no effort in promoting the savings movement, and the amount subscribed by the end of last year was 11 million yuan, ranking third among all regions in the country. The General Association deeply appreciated the citizens of Shanghai and sent a telegram to the Shanghai promotion agencies to commend them. It is heard that the majority of the subscribed funds in Shanghai are savings deposits, followed by savings bonds. In addition to the assets invested with the savings as the primary guarantee, and the issuing bank being directly responsible to the depositors, the safety of the principal and interest of these savings is guaranteed by the government. The utilization of the savings is carried out entirely in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations on Savings for Nation-Building.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Western Newspaper Reports Workers Did Not Make Demands <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company abruptly ended their lightning strike this morning (9th) and resumed work together at 7:45 am, which was unexpected and quite astonishing. It was previously expected that this labor dispute would be prolonged or even spread to other public transport companies in the city. This expectation has now been disproven. However, the most surprising thing this morning is that the workers did not make any demands to the company, nor did they explain the reason for the strike. A member of the British trolley company emphatically denied this morning that the workers had made any demands. According to him, there is no basis to the Chinese newspapers' report that the workers made five demands. The company is greatly puzzled by the workers' sudden strike because it has not yet been able to ascertain the motivation behind it. Now that the workers have unconditionally resumed work, it is quite gratifying.</p>

<p>After Du Chongyuan was detained in Xinjiang by the provincial government chairman Sheng Shicai, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, and others sent telegrams to inquire about rescuing him. It is heard that Chairman Sheng has telegraphed back to Huang and others about the detention process, stating that it is related to politics and that Du was attempting to undermine the rear in Xinjiang. The evidence is conclusive. Please explain the situation in detail to Du's relatives and friends. If Du's relatives and friends have any doubts about this case and want to come to Xinjiang to see the evidence, they are welcome to do so.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Increase in Rates by the Shanghai Municipal Council Will Exacerbate Inflation; Contradicting the Policy of Suppressing Inflation; The Ratepayers' Meeting Should Give Serious Consideration <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The four million citizens of Shanghai are under high price pressure and have no room to breathe. The sudden news that the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to increase rates by 40 percent starting on the first day of this year is like a bolt from the blue, causing great shock. A certain ratepayer told reporters yesterday that the soaring prices in Shanghai have already reached a serious level, and all those who care about social order are taking it as a hidden danger. Now, in order to meet its exchange rate subsidies and other expenses, the Municipal Council is making unlimited rate increases, which is completely contrary to its usual policy of suppressing inflation. Why not select Chinese staff for such large Western personnel exchange subsidies? The orchestra setting is already criticized by public opinion, why not resolutely remove it? The most serious reflection of the rate increase is the further increase in rents. Landlords increase land taxes, and landlords increase rates, which are ultimately passed on to tenants. The increase in various license fees also comes from the general public. It is expected that high price pressure will be intensified by the rate increases. How can we, the small people, bear it? We have nothing else to say but to hope that the Municipal Council will pay special attention to the public's ability to bear the burden when discussing rate increases at the special Ratepayers' Meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Sincere Consultation on Five Labor-Management Disputes; Resolution of Knitting Worker Strike <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The telegraph operators of the Pacific, Great Eastern, and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus requested that the authorities increase their salaries. Since the incident occurred on the 6th, the bureau and representatives of the telegraph operators had an hour-long conversation yesterday, and there is now a glimmer of hope. According to the telegraph operators, the demands they made this time were a last resort. They are well aware of the complex current situation and the difficulties they face. Therefore, they maintained a upright position and made reasonable demands in a sincere manner, and they hoped that the bureau would understand their difficulties.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Strike Mediation</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek dockworkers' strike has been going on for four days since its launch. In order to avoid further expansion of the incident, the person in charge of the labor union scheduled a meeting yesterday morning to mediate between labor and management. Because the management did not attend, the mediation failed and was rescheduled for the morning of the 11th of this month, hoping to end the strike as soon as possible. Yesterday noon, representatives from various offices specially prepared 5,000 steamed buns and went to distribute them to the striking workers to express their condolences. Yesterday, the branches of all docks in the city, including 80,000 workers, held a joint meeting at the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union and resolved: (1) To establish a support committee and take unified action; (2) Workers at all docks in the city will provide as much spiritual and material assistance as possible. Knitting Workers Resume Work</p>
<p>More than 300 engineers and technicians belonging to 129 electrical knitting sock factories in the city put forward various demands, including improved treatment and increased cost-of-living allowances. The matter was fully resolved at 9:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. The management has accepted all the conditions put forward by the labor side and both parties have signed a contract.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Deadline for Reply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration and all its branches in the city's postmen and deliverymen, etc., last November submitted a request to Director-General Chaplim, requesting that the Kunming General Office increase the cost-of-living allowance by 50 percent, and the year-end double salary allowance should also be included. Chaplim immediately telegraphed the General Office, but due to postal delays, he did not receive any information. Later, he telegraphed again to urge them. The General Office telegraphed back, agreeing to increase the allowance by 25 percent, which must be formally approved by the Ministry of Communications. It is now known that all employees of the Shanghai Bureau are feeling increasingly difficult in their livelihoods and have telegraphed again, setting a deadline for a satisfactory reply by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taxi Worker Strike</p>
<p>All office staff and drivers of the four major taxi companies in the city, including Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Tailai, and Yinse, had previously asked the company authorities to increase their salaries and allowances. The political department of the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession once came forward to mediate, but the two sides insisted on their own views and reached a stalemate. According to reliable sources from the News Agency yesterday, the employees of the four major taxi companies once convened a meeting at around 5:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The "Fang Dan" Tax Case Continued Yesterday <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The case of four wealthy Chinese gentlemen, Wan Jiaping, Hu Jingwan, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, suing the Municipal Council over the "Fang Dan" land tax was held for the second continued hearing in the Consular Court yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Council Committee Hall. At that time, the defendant's lawyer, Boyland, attacked the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, in a similar manner to his attack on the first plaintiff, Fang Jiaping, during the first hearing the day before.</p>
<p>Boyland stated that you (the plaintiffs) receive all the benefits and protection provided by the Municipal Council, but are unwilling to pay land tax to maintain the Municipal Council's expenses. Furthermore, since the plaintiffs do not pay land tax to the Municipal Council, they have also not paid taxes to the Chinese government. Regarding this point, although the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, was unable to produce tax receipts from the Chinese government, he denied not paying taxes to the government. Boyland then mentioned that the plaintiffs had requested the Lawyers' Association to forward the case to the Chongqing government, attempting to use political pressure to win the case. The plaintiffs did not answer because this matter was not within the scope of the law. Boyland continued, saying that the ownership of the "Fang Dan" held by the second plaintiff, Hu Jingfang, was questionable. The plaintiff replied that assuming the ownership of the land does not belong to me, then the Municipal Council should not collect tax from me even more so. After some questions and answers that were not related to the case, Boyland asked the plaintiff whether the "Fang Dan" he possessed was picked up from the street. The plaintiff replied that it was inherited from his ancestors. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer, Liu Shifang, stated that more than forty years ago, when the Public Concession expanded to the boundary of the plaintiff Hu Jingfang's property, there were no regulations on collecting land tax. Six years ago, when the plaintiff built a house and started paying house tax, the Municipal Council did not request the collection of land tax.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Another Rice Merchant Transacted Beyond the Limit and Was Sentenced to Ten Months Imprisonment; Da Dexing Company Increased Prices and Sold Twice <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the rice market, the Shanghai Municipal Council strictly enforces the price limits of the Price Evaluation Committee and prosecutes rice merchants who hoard, speculate, manipulate, and sell rice above the price limit. Recently, a rice merchant named Zhang Junlong was sentenced to ten months in prison for exceeding the price limit by a court. Now, in order to thoroughly investigate the matter, the political department of the Municipal Council has dispatched a large number of detectives to various rice shops and warehouses to investigate inventory and sales prices. On the 25th of last month, Mao Guobao, a Chinese detective of the department, investigated the ledgers of the Da Dexing Grain Shop at No. 676 Zhejiang Road and found that on the 21st, ten bags of No. 1 Gongmi rice were sold for 92.5 yuan, exceeding the price limit of 5.5 yuan per dan. There were also ten bags of GK No. 2 Saigon rice sold for 87 yuan, but the ledger was changed to No. 1 Saigon to meet the price limit (because the price limit for No. 1 Gong rice was 87 yuan, and the price limit for No. 2 Saigon rice was 81.5 yuan). In fact, it also exceeded 5.5 yuan per dan. He then reported it to the First Special District Court and obtained an arrest warrant. The previous day, the manager of the shop, Gao Hanting from Wuxi, was arrested by Detective Mao. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted him in accordance with Article 14 of the Regulations on Stabilizing Prices and Eliminating Speculation during Extraordinary Times and Articles 15, 31, and 32 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce, requesting that he be punished according to law. After questioning by Judge Shen Tianbao, Gao Hanting was sentenced to ten months in prison as a warning. Gao declared that he was not satisfied and would appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Strict Crackdown on the Rice Market; Prices Fell to the Price Limit Yesterday; People's Hearts Are Weak; Hoarders Are Selling in Large Quantities <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee re-evaluated the prices of various grades of foreign rice the day before yesterday. A total of seven grades were evaluated: (1) Xiao Jiao was evaluated at 1 yuan lower; (2) Saigon Annam rice tea, (3) No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice, (4) Gao Tokyo white rice, (5) Tokyo brown rice were each evaluated at 2 yuan lower, and Annam粳 was added with a price limit of 89 yuan (calculated per dan, 160 catties); (6) No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice, (7) Xiao Wen rice were each evaluated at 2 yuan lower (calculated per bag, i.e., the original bag that has arrived at the English-Chinese Company). The remaining eight types were maintained at the original prices evaluated on the 24th of last month. A total of fifteen types. The council officially announced this yesterday and will strictly enforce it. If anyone is found to have exceeded the price limit, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be lenient. Rice merchants are feeling apprehensive and are selling in large quantities in the market. The prices of all grades of foreign rice in the market yesterday have fallen within the price limit. Rice brokers have been temporarily allowed to re-enter the market to resume business starting yesterday to observe the results. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., more than 200 rice brokers gathered outside the rice market, all wearing badges. After repeated warnings from Shao Qingfu and Cai Weixiang, the two people in charge, they entered the market separately. The situation yesterday did not allow for out-of-bounds actions.</p>
