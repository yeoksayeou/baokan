<p>社評</p>
<h3>東地中海的新形勢</h3>
<p>構成英國東地中海防禦三角據點之一的克里特島，現在已正式宣告陷落。當去年十一月義希酣戰的時候，英國為確保東地中海的生命綫，一面以陸空軍援助希臘，抵制義軍的南下，一面在非洲對義大利帝國舉行突擊，嗣在海軍一再對義艦隊的獲勝中、一舉而佔領克里特島。於是，東面的塞浦洛斯島，南面的亞力山大軍港，再加上新佔領的克里特島，就成立一個鼎足的形勢；而屏蔽了蘇夷士，以及近東，中東，和非洲。</p>
<p>可是局勢轉移，在德義佔領整個巴爾幹半島後，牠們繼續前進，企圖瓦解英帝國的最妙途徑，當然是通過十耳其，叙利亞，佔領阿刺伯半島，一舉而突到蘇彝士的後力，使戰綫擴到中東一帶，迫英國勢力不得不從地中海東部急速撤退。所以一個月前英伊衝突爆發的時候，舉世的目光，都集中在蘇土兩國，而替英國布中東，甚至牠的印度外圍防禦，′揑着一把汗。因之嚴格說起來，克里特大戰的哭然爆發，是多少有點出於一般意料之外，而比較與英有利的。牠的意義是：第一，說明了蘇·十對於德，義假道及瓜分近東，中東提議堅定的態度。第二，雖然國際演變還有隨時出現兀突形勢的可能，但照常理推測，德。義這次不惜任何犧牲，而決心佔領克里特，那用意，也許要超過僅僅搖動英國東地中海的覇權以上，而企圖闢出一條新的途徑，由克里特島，而塞浦洛斯島，而法屬叙利亞，循著這條路綫伸入中東，竭力避免侵及土耳其的疆土、以防止與蘇。土兩國引起可能的磨擦。如果眞是如此的，確具有重大意義。</p>
<p>照今昨兩天世界各處的電訉看來，德，義今後在東地中海行動的目標，大半是英屬塞浦洛斯島。所以現在値得關心的，不外兩點；（一）德·義進攻塞浦洛斯島的成敗，到底怎樣？（二）影響於整個戰爭形勢如何？</p>
<p>為了理解第一點，首先不得不想起的，是這一次克里特島大戰的經騐。在面積上，塞浦洛斯是地中海裘除去西西里島，撒丁島而外的第三個大島，所以牠對防軍一切便利的供給力量，要大過克里特。在位置上，牠比克里特接近英國空軍根據地的埃及與巴力斯坦，同時，距德國在希臘本部的空軍根據地，却較遠一點。因之德，義在克里特的壓倒空軍優勢，也許無法重演於塞浦洛斯的上空，以言軍備，則除馬耳他島外，牠是英國最大海空軍根據地，當然不是英希倉卒設防中的克里特可比。這些，都是牠與克里特不同的地方。不過最根本的一點，牠在地勢上，同為孤懸於海中的島嶼，所以德，義進攻塞浦洛斯的唯一可能方式，也還是集中力量，由空中加以閃擊。由克里特大戰的經騐，德·義空軍的壓倒優勢，逼迫英軍不得不放棄，而英軍亦始終未曾大規模增援，尤其注定了牠的陷落命運。克里特戰爭開始後不久，英國就宣佈金部空軍的撒退，而到結局時，英軍一萬五千人也自動撤離。這些與德·義的不惜任何犧牲進攻的情形一比，足見英國並沒有出全力防禦的決心。當然，這一次歐戰兩方面的最後成敗，恐怕還是以資源和經濟為最後決定的因素，軍事上的進退已經是次要的了，何况一據點的得失？過去英國曾在同樣情形下由挪威，鄧寇克，義屬索瑪里蘭，及巴爾幹半島等四次撤軍，克里特的撒守，已為第五次。那末，萬一德。義傾全力進攻塞浦洛斯時，英國有沒有集中力量即行決戰的準備和行動，將為決定該處勝敗的最大關鍵。此外，要指出來的，德，義經過克里特戰中大量犧牲之後，將來對於塞浦洛斯攻擊的猛烈程度，必然的，也要相當减小。</p>
<p>塞浦洛斯戰爭萬一發生，那末，整個的中東，地中海東部，一直到非洲，就要發生了非常劇烈的爭奪戰，在德。義方面，牠的左翼由巴爾幹起經克里特島。而企圖佔領塞浦洛斯，佔領叙利亞，直向蘇彝士與紅海進攻；牠的右翼，則經過義屬非洲里此亞，企圖衝過埃及，達到蘇彝士。這樣，不啻是一個鉅大的所謂「鉗形運動」。企圖瓦解英帝國在這一帶的勢力。英國方面呢，牠現在最有利的，却有兩點，其一、義大利在阿比西尼亞的勢力，幾乎已經掃蕩凈盡；其二，伊拉克的反英一派力量，已經大體消除。這些一是令英國目前最放心的地方，搆成英國在這一帶從事任何有效抵抗的最先決條件。所以從整個戰局看，阿比西尼亞及伊拉克兩後方的安定，對於英國的重要性，比起克里特的得失來。還要大得多。</p>
<p>最後還有一個問題，就是橫在德，義右翼上，英屬馬耳他島在未來爭奪戰裏的位置。到底德，義會不會即行同時對牠閃擊，要留着等將來的事實解答。</p>

<h3>金價小回</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、斤動步跌、後復又小回、各方人心於極穩中稍帶恍惚、因傳大西洋美艦隊出動說、美滙硬至五元三七五可結、金號證券幫進、升至六千叫百七十五元、不久即來復來、滙票商爭售、於十點左右一度退至六千四百四十五元、但美滙鬆勢不久即回平、金號滙票商復來進、提升至六千四百六十元左右趨穩、下午更形平庸、終軋小十七元、全日交易二萬兩、大戶均出入不定、現金亦見回跌、合盛出五十兩、永豐德出二十兩、由聯興買進、價照期交高三百零五元、永成出成記五十兩、高二百元、天元出聯興二十兩、高一百九十元、下午義豐出天元八十兩、價高三百元、比上日亦小十數元、飾金關金等仍平、</p>

<p>飾金仍舊小動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾余每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛六百丸十五兀未更、牧進减叫十元云、</p>
<p>外鈔均見疲落</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價雖稍鍥疲、然英美金鎊之趨勢仍挺、結果各升一元、英金票忽有供給、市價下落一元、美金票軋跌四分、晚市退為十八元二角七分、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票略趨堅穩、晚市為一元九角七分、朝鮮票趨勢仍軟、晚市　為一元六角四分、</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率仍未更、每千元貼進二角五分、貼出七角半、與五日價同、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均仍掛七分云、</p>
<h3>糧食　兩租界公賣米　確有平米市力</h3>
<p>洋米昨市繼續趨跌、形勢軟弱、後市或須再度下遊、綠港米平價公賣已經續有訂開、貢米平賣亦在兜售、米店等實銷均注意低價之港越米、市上回籠貨噸見供過於求、散多大戶因環境不利、莫不急於貶價求脫、奈木化旣呆、客”父淡、期現各米乃至再度猛跌、一號西貢自一百廿二元小至百廿元、二號自一百十七兀小至一百十四兀、碎米九十三元小至八十九元、暹　一號一百十七元、二號一百十三元、敏黨一百十七九元、小絞自、百十六元至一百十四元、英華司碎米現貨一百〇五元至一百〇三元、路貨一百〇二元、期小絞一百卅五六元、西貢一號一百卅八九元、均比前市小去三四元、全日交易現貨祇六千多包、期貨小到六百噸云、</p>
<p>工部局洋米昨又有到滬、太古公司岳州輪、由香港裝來五千包、昨午扺埠、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨雖仍寥寥、然以洋米疲跌、人心一致趨餒、小落一二元、計開崑山鮮粳百卅四元、普通百卅二元百卅元、南港早晚稻新鮮百卅六七元、原包百四十元、</p>
<p>糯米一牽百動、相隨軟化、銷塲旣祇一些零星胃口、而貨主售意亦鬆、故售價悉貶二元左右、開香港白元百十三元百十一元、特團粒百十五元、糯茶百零五元、國糯百念二元、百念元、</p>
<h3>粉市疲莫能與</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、經前日轉跌後、又因米油跌價、實銷觀望、目新麥不久上市、市塲賣氣殊為濃厚、金龍牌坎粉首先降至二十九元、澳洲粉上午一度擯持、卒趨不支、　午做開鐘樓牌二十九元八角、銀行棧貨米開、砲台牌美粉亦鬆至二十九元二角、比h日各跌五六角、成交併計五六千包、又洋粉昨源源而來、太占公司岳州輪、由香港裝來一千五百包、昨晨抵埠、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、今日有六百包、裝安慶輪運往厦門、</p>
<p>小麥交易、毫無做開、內地及附近新麥、雖已登塲、運滬尙屬有待、陳麥存底滬地巳少、內地則尙多、蓋由於搬運困難、無法輸出、本年新麥來申、恐尙有許多週折云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　白豆見新</h3>
<p>昨日新蠶豆有白皮嘉定貨見樣、出品年成、亦如靑蠶豆、身瘦粒細、業中人云、係受春雪雨雹摧殘、致發育不足、該豆暫因搬　證尙未領出、故遲未運滬、昨傳由日商問津無證貨一批、價為三十五元、靑皮蠶豆仍為北港貨、價為四十二元八角原盤、由香港幫及泉州幫辦去三百餘包、黃豆貨中貶値、天津豆價為四十八元、由香港幫辦去三千餘包、木街分去膠州豆二百包、價為四十六元、歸德豆四百餘包、價為四十五兀二角四十五元五角、今晨有豆子九百三十包、生仁二百包運厦鬥、又有豆子二百八十包運新加坡、苞米來滬亦甚多、前日渣華郵船公司芝根第、芝沙力兩輪到滬、由爪哇運來苞米三萬餘包、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、昨日有苞米二千五百包、裝新北京輪、運往烟臺、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債頻漲稍跌</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續趨堅、惟以漲風已歷六七日、午後稍稍回鬆、形勢未必遽走下風、目賣戶斬多為少、新放居多、如一有扺補、行市仍不易看小、昨日上午、九成怡泰潤利大都補空、恒康鴻大信孚多頭加碼、協興兀協康大都為多頭出籠、新華永康稍有吐出、丙種頃刻囤出八元、見八元四角高價、乙種亦衝出七十元大關、甲種J＾J過問者少、竟未能亦步亦趨、隨衆上騰、致仍屈居於原價、午後、鴻大信孚德孚信昌大德永康均有買進、但賣氣較湧、一好即見回小、所小亦有限、如聯和同順益昌聯益均在紛紛賣出、午後回小一二角、結果除丁種略小二角外、餘仍漲二三角、但甲種祇好五分而已、成交總數共計約二百五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實業社股九十三股、價為二十三元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市於極穩中稍帶軟化、成交仍淸稀、經營者供求、均感乏味、</p>
<p>倫教二日（週一）電、今日為英倫例假、證券市塲停業一天、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機賣意復萌　紗市微露軟象</h3>
<p>上日回昂之紗市、昨則稍帶軟象、此因投機的人們、鑒於漲風已戢、賣意復起、於是拋空者一夥、市盤乃稍見回下、不過實銷雖不暢、然比昔較為活絡、同時原料不肯大鬆、所以有一部份依然逢低落時來收進也、二十支雙馬高價為一千四百五十五元、低價為一千四百三十五元、午後初做一千叫百三十元、中途因標金良好、漲至一千四百三十六元、旅以空方活動、又向下游、跌至一千四百二十七元、最後價為一千四百三十元、目前紗市有人說、恐在一千四百三五十元之間、作盤旋之局面也、今日有棉紗二十五件運庇能、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日堅挺之氣續昂、不料開了高盤、大衆喊賣出、如斯一來、檯面反見不靈、首盤價為一千四百五十元、少頃漲至」千四百五十五元、然出者紛紜、籌碼一鬆、即刻軟至一千四百四十二元、但在此四十二三元間、進退甚久、迨至十二時左右、氣勢忽疲、謂有和平謠言、跌至一千四百三十五元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千三百包、內香港幫進三百包、同行八千包、</p>
<h3>棉市略見起色</h3>
<p>現棉交易、雖無　批的發展、然人心尙堪維持、因海外訂價不鬆、大衆對於細絨原料仍把厚望、於相巧價格下、間有掉動、所以消費雖則寥寥、市價依然不下、不過駢絨貨色一蹶不振、目下猶難聞其生息耳、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠洋行外棉交易、近因紗市與廠方極大打擊、同時國際情勢惡劣、、因之各方似皆不敢大量採購、但市况仍頗堅定、昨日同業有做四百五十元左右之巴西棉二百件、轉運靑島、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、呆滯而無特色、昨日收盤價格、略漲三五磅音、</p>
<p>印棉停市、又預測今日開盤市况、較之上日看跌二羅比左右、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布冉冉上升</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢微堅、人氣穩固、故各布售盤反跌為漲、怡和粗布、南洋幫繼續搜辦、各檔漲每疋二角半至五角、十六磅彩花蝶組布六月份期貨、開出四十九元五角、較現市高七角半、富貴細布晨開四十二元七角半、細斜三十九元、午後略回、較上日均見升騰、本街成交各布二百數卜件、南洋幫辦怡和粗布粗斜色布漂布等二百餘件、今日有疋頭九件運厦門、又一百件運新加坡、二十件運庇能、</p>
<p>東布市價、仍不脫盤旋之狀、現員市塲、因棧單籌碼不多、上午售盤殊緊、下午則以取引所龍頭期貨反跌六七角、現　乃亦被其　小、龍頭細布廠單收盤為四十四元五角五分、四君子嗶嘰一元四角一分八七五、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑木耳復緊</h3>
<p>黑木耳近以去化較活、號盤復趨堅挺、如川耳叫八百餘元、河口耳七百六十餘元、行盤因亦隨緊、或有再升之望、</p>
<h3>糖市　期糖勢難挽　繼續慘跌不止</h3>
<p>昨糖市期貨粗白開盤、雖略見回好、但逐後依然步跌、頹勢終難挽回、且遠期反小、竟是倒懸局面、可見慘跌之勢、似猶未已、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白一月份到老貨九十元、跌一元三角、五月份到新貨九十一元六角、降三元夕譜、六月十日期貨、上午開盤為九十五元二角、收盤九十四元、下午以九十四元開盤、步降至九十二元、降二元八角、六月二十日期上午為九十四元四角至九十三元三角、下午九十二元九角至九十一元二角、降四元許、荷赤現貨新到降至七十三元、比上週一跌去八元、太古車白較平、西棧為一百〇三元半、無甚上落、昨有糖一千六百二十包自香港運來、</p>
<p>藥芡近因到貨不繼、市存日見軋缺、物稀為貴、於是堅升不已、昨市白皮藥芡打盤叫一百六十元、售過一百五十六元、惟紅皮貨不甚合銷、反見鬆軟、已由一百二十元回至一百十五元、次之一百十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤受主寥寥</h3>
<p>白煤行情、在此夏令淡銷時節、木步步低落、有跌無漲、端節　、因貨主大批出籠、脫貨求現、更見慘跌、日來自煤球加高以後、稍稍回上、但亦强弩之末、無能為力、蓋勢所然也、昨日同得利白煤、同業自車、高喊四百三十元、但受主寥寥、聞新貨日內即將抵埠、遠期難以看好云、</p>
<h3>雜項　皂去路清淡</h3>
<p>肥皂市况平庸、雖廠盤提高、本客採辦無多、囤戶觀望、近市如固本皂每箱五十三元五角、白祥茂每箱四十四元五角、箭刀皂每箱四十二元、亨利愛字皂每箱四十二元、均無變化、黃祥茂每箱四十二元五角、交易較旺、洋燭行盤復提高、但市面買價實難轉機、因銷路偏於鄉間、夏令所用减少、如船燭每箱念七元四角、比前略增、</p>

<p>現在世界各國對於落花生的需要日殷，因為它實在是一種極可寳貴的東四。它，—這事誰不知道呢？—無論炒，煮，油炸，糖漬，鹽醃，沒有一種吃法不是滋味絕佳，快人朶顧的！眞是鹹甜竹宜，老少歡迎！所以在許許多多種糖菓糕點上，全有它的倩影點綴着。至於用它榨出來的油，可以吃，燃，造肥皂，滑機器，最近更用以製作「人造奶油」，……而且連它那榨油所剩的糟粕，也是喂牲畜，或糞田的極好肥料：你說它在無論農工商業上，或民生日用匕，所佔的位置應該是多麼里要吧！</p>

<h3>各界昨紀念戒煙節　抱拒毒務精神　自動協助政府肅清毒氛　煙民矢志戒除強身強國</h3>
<p>昨日為林文忠公（則徐）在虎門焚燬鴉片第一百〇二週年紀念日、經中央規定為禁烟節、滬市各界民衆、為協助政府推行禁政、振禽民族精神、故一致努力推行禁毒運動、特一及高二兩法院焚燬沒收毒品、各團體發告烟民書、勉即日醒悟、自行戒絕嗜好、俾節省無謂靡費、恢復健全體魄、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>誓遵國策　合力拒毒</p>
<p>昨日為「六三」禁烟節、國民政府以烟毒為害甚於洪水猛獸、一經嗜吸成癮、能使精神頹唐、壯志銷沉、思想束縛身體斫傷、故於民國一十一年成立全國禁烟委員會、由蔣總裁仟禁烟總監規定三年禁毒、六年禁烟、原期在此限期以內、全國各地烟毒絕跡、故各地政府雷厲執行、除戰時後方各地業於去年根絕外、淪陷區域則以情形特殊、相反的烟毒之瀰漫、竟甚於推行禁烟前之狀態、致便烟民數量激增、禁烟政策、功虧一簣、故舉國上下、莫不深切警惕、而誓尊重國策、合力推行拒毒運動、俾再接再厲、早日肅淸烟毒、拯烟民於水深火熱之中、健全體魄、節省無謂消耗、充實國力、</p>
<p>法院循例　焚毀毒物</p>
<p>江蘇高等法院第二分院及第一特區地方法院、為完成禁政、貫撤「拒毒務本」、「拒毒務盡」、故對烟毒罪案均採取最嚴之刑法、以收事牛功倍之效、捕房當局亦均認眞從事、以肅淸界內烟毒為職志、故兩法院每於禁烟節日、舉行焚燬沒收之烟毒物品器皿、用示提倡禁烟、紀念禁烟節之至意、昨日循例舉行焚燬烟毒工作、今後對於懲處烟毒人犯、決遵司法部最近頒佈之治罪條例從嚴處治、期達禁絕烟毒目的、</p>
<p>煙民覺醒　努力戒除</p>
<p>木市各團體為紀念禁烟節、昨特發告全市烟民書云、當一八三九年的六月三日、湖廣總督林則徐、在廣州虎門、將販運入口之鴉片二萬箱加以焚燬、因當時滿淸政府的無能、才使烟毒繼續在國內瀰漫、英國心理學家霍爾說「不能以三等體格的國民、造成第一等的國家」、「有了體格的黃金時代、三十年後、必有一個文化的黃金時代、這短短幾句話、充分說明健康是　家强弱的關鍵、當今抗建時期、尤其應該珍重身體、養精蓄銳、為國家民族奮鬭努力、再接再厲、表現其內在力量、要知染上了烟毒、能使壯志消沉、精神頹唐、身體斷喪、思想束縛、但我政府不因戰事而中止禁政、仍以嚴格之罪刑、懲處烟毒案犯、並且規定今後再犯將處極形、全市的烟民們、這是多麼的危險、你們應該從速的去戒除、重新做一個良好的國民、光大自身的事業、從事復興國家民族的責任、才不愧對林文忠公及蔣委員長先後昭示我們的敎訓、</p>
<p>立德社勉　自覺覺人</p>
<p>上海立德聯誼社發表告民衆文云、</p>
<p>我國禁烟問題、曾經過長時間的努力、凡留心國家前途之人、沒有一個不想到這問題的嚴重、因為烟毒不禁絕、其惡劣結果、可以妨碍社會的正常進化、可以毀滅民族的生命安全、我國禁烟問題、在事實上是具有政治和外交相互連鎖關係的一個問題、是摧殘我國民族精神、民族意識的一種方法、不過禁烟問題是攸關社會安全、民族生死的嚴重問題、是明知易見的單純事實、是應做的當前工作、在佈滿毒素的今天孤島上、我們要樹起民族意識的族幟、從客觀理智上喚起大衆的注意、自覺覺人、掃除烟毒、這最低限度的希望、是我們紀念六三紀念節向市民提出的一種要求、一種禮物、</p>

<h3>二批港米　今日全市出售　私運出口米糧查係存貨　團體購米仍須米號轉手</h3>
<p>工部局辦理之小絞米、第二批訂購、業於前日開始分派、凡巳獲分派之二十餘　雜糧行、昨已開始付款提貨、現木埠八十餘家米號、因市民購糴小紋米者激增、所分派之米、完全售罄、而無法應市、昨日據米業界消息、凡業巳將平價小絞米售罄之各米號、今日均可提貨應市、以後工部局代辦小絞米訂購機關、當儘量迅速辦理、充分供給、以免中斷之弊、</p>

<h3>美放棄華領判權　促進中國強盛　以免日本濫用此項特　阻碍中國民族運動發展</h3>
<p>大權報社評云、美國國務卿赫爾、日前曾在華盛噸宣稱、一俟和半恢復後、美國將放棄在華領事裁判權、此項宣言、在熟知中美關係者視之、實非意外之事、蓋深知美人認在華領事裁判權僅屬一種臨時辦法、且彼國對於中國人能完全統洽其小國之願望亦巳一再表示同情與諒解、</p>
<p>美國政府　早擬放棄</p>
<p>在事實上言美政府早擬放棄其在華領事裁判權、祗因其他國家不允步美後塵、以致未果、十餘年前、華人對於取消各國在華領事裁判權之運動、進行甚力、後因一九三一年瀋陽事變爆發、乃告中止、以日人之侵略、實為中國民族主義精神生長之主要障碍物也、</p>
<p>甚願中國　達到願望</p>
<p>但華人深信美國人民及其政府、甚</p>
<p>願幫助中國達到其取消領事栽判權之合法願望、倫敦方面之中國友人、如能出以同樣表示、則華人對之、自當更為興奮、其實此事甚屬可能、蓋因近年來英美對於處置東方各種問題、往往採取平行政策也、</p>
<p>其他國家　從中作梗</p>
<p>其他國家和用其在華之領事栽判權</p>
<p>而干涉中國內部之事、並阻碍中國之進步、中國人民在一九一一年革命以後、對於自已所處之地位、遲遲不能明瞭、其主要原因、即為若干國家濫用領事裁判權之故、</p>
<p>放棄特　　乃在自衛</p>
<p>近年來日本利用其領事裁判權、作為侵略中國之護符、英美二國均知日本之濫用此項利權、不特妨碍華人之和益、目更妨碍英美本身在華之權利、西方民治國家所以寗願放棄此項特權之原因、即在於此、蓋彼等希望促進中國之强盛、即所以打擊日本之野心企圖、日本對於西方國家早懷仇視敵對之心也、駐華巴西公使賴戈夫婦來滬小游後、昨已搭開平號輪前往北平、</p>

<h3>各種工業　原料困難</h3>
<p>紗廠等業經營不易據工部局工業科報告、上月間、多數紗廠之工作情形、衡諸實施限制電力以前之時期、相差無幾、華商紗廠十七家之經理暨工程師三十人、會作第二次之集會、討論節電方法、以期出品能盡量避免减少、同時維持工人收入、造紙廠數家、巳將工人半月一次之例假展長、以資减工、粗紗售價大跌、但細支仍維持高價、上月十二日起、銀錢業拒絕棉紗押款、以致引起拋風、紗市下落、重以舊歷端午節汛、賣風重起、於是紗布價格、益見削落、毛織業因不易覓取原料與時令關係、故業務受有影響、絲廠之在開工者、僅有四家、但絲織廠仍工作如常、此外、印墨水油漆集、鋼鐵業、木材業、以及橡膠業、均感覓取原料之困難、</p>
<p>發生於工廠中之意外事件、凡九十九起、內有致命有十一起、工業科對於勸導工廠注意工業安全之事宜、仍積極進行、上月查有工廠五十家、已將設備改進、此外發生於工廠中之火警凡十一起、結果工人死六名、傷十名、</p>

<p>濟南輪脫險後　宣布共同海損</p>

<h3>五教之行　與儒之專責</h3>
<p>融五講經社第十六次講經，孫翔仲君講五敎之行與儒之專責，共分五節：</p>
<p>（一）各敎推行的原動力一，人類隱微具有宇宙整個活力，顯言之，則為感情理智意志力之作用，二，初步起因，則發動於信心，感知個人以上之生命，繼後成果，則視為神跡，接通萬有生命，達到獻身之道德。</p>
<p>（二）各敎演變的過程宗敎無所謂進化退化，而其過程，隨乎人文而有演變。一，人文較低者，甘受外制，每為崇拜自然物等。二，人文較高者，則知用自力趨重於人倫。</p>
<p>（三）五敎之特點與其異同五敎中儒車人道，釋明性道，道宗天道，耶尊上帝，回述眞宰，其學多道德作用上說，故道德為宗敎根本問題。惟因各敎所宗之點稍異，而敎義敎旨，遂有幾多差別。</p>
<p>（四）儒之專責一，漢代如賈誼新書，劉安淮南子，楊雄太元經等，皆用力於儒與道之講通。至唐宋則主儒，道，佛，三敎調和，立說更富，而近時五敎融通趨勢，則實為時代之要求。二，儒為融通之骨幹，就儒仃載，儒兼仁讓剛毅全德，儒效述儒者，善能調一天下，在朝則失政，在下則美俗，於此略可窺見儒之實際。三，儒也者，確然為人類之所需，各敎於人類無不有益，即各敎之中，無不備眞儒道，故儒道行，即是各敎行，儒之無常與二達德作用至浩。</p>
<p>（五）人類終極目標世界人類，羣望大同極樂，達到萬類一體。萬類一體，即為物不二，身心不二，神人不二，世出世法不二。</p>
<p>孫君熱誠講演，聽講者均異常注　，掌聲不絕。是日講堂通二間為一問，仍復座滿，足見聽講者之興趣，日益增進矣。</p>

<h3>血本？</h3>
<p>— 石子</p>
<p>木來「不顧血本大减價」，是商人的一種廣告手腕，我們時常可以在百貨商店的玻璃窗上看到，在綢緞店門首，可以看到。但在米店的櫃檯上，看到揷上一塊「不顧血本」的紙版，却眞出了我們的意外。尤其是在這米貴如珍珠的當世，米商人居然也肯忍痛來個「不顧血本」，誠然「不可思議」。</p>
<p>米商人能「不顧血本」，大概是「體恤民艱」吧。其「熱陽俠骨」，直屬「可風」。可惜紙版上寫「不顧血本」下面注定價目是「一百零二元」，再觀米的成色，似非良佳；大概此項米，曾在米棧內經過長期休息」的。港米售價祇一百十元，又値天時將屆黃霉，因得蒙「米蛀蟲」特加隆恩於市民，慨然「不顧血本」出貨矣！</p>
<p>我們並不健忘，七八十元的米價，是離關現在極近的；七八十元的價目囤進，現在一百零三元的高價售出，就漂亮地喊出「不顧血本」來，眞不知從　談起。</p>
<h3>從「路屍」說起</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>上月（五日）廿九日各報登載了如F的一段消息：</p>
<p>「本市一般貧民，因受百物高漲威脅，餓斃者日見其多。據普善由莊發表，自本月一日至二十七日止，經該莊收掩公共租界區內屍體有二千八百四十六具之多，其中孩屍佔二千二百五十具，成人屍體五百丸十六具。」</p>
<p>但這裏不外這樣的幾點：一。貧窮的人在今日的社會制度　，不容掩飾，是佔着絕對的大多數，加上生活費甩的激增，於是飢餓與死亡的人數也就跟着正比例而上漲；而沒有死的，在今天也不知有多少在與「死亡」相搏鬥着。</p>
<p>當然，澈底的獲救是有待於我們的努力，夾把社會的不平剷除，同樣的人，壓迫人的不合理現狀得必須根除；不過，在今天假如還是像某某資方這樣一味執拗不悟，而把要出賣勞方來換得一飽的同人，逼上死亡與飢餓的道路上去，總為智者所不取！</p>
<p>何况在今天是還該在「减少路屍」和維持社會治安上着手的。</p>
<p>二。也由於餓的根，而連帶到病的產生。這也是不能輕視的社會病態，日前在本刊上見到的一篇「送診給藥」的文字，更可見這項措置在今日的急切需要，而希望我們的租界當局能早為設法，否則，像今日的道批「名醫」這樣，錢不送到府上，病人的死活，是與他不相干的，好在不死他自已！但租界的執政　，想是小能坐視貧民的死亡的吧！</p>
<p>第三·從這段新聞　，更有着嚴　的一點，就是二千八百四十六具的屍首中間，孩屍竟佔上了二千二百五十具之多，它佔了百分之八十一以上。你想，世界各國都在獎勵生育，强迫結婚，但在中國，僅僅五海一隅，會有如此驚人的數字出現，道不能不令人傷心，因為這是中華民族的損失，這實在該急起設法的。</p>
<p>要是，我們再想一想，兒童在這個數字裏，更不知有多少是餓死，病死，或者甚至死於非命的，但法律最多也不過是抓他們的父母來治之以罪，可是法律却沒有辦法保障他們的生活，不能保障他們的肚子不餓！</p>
<p>所以，在今天，要使大家都有飯吃，才是天下第一椿要緊事！</p>
<h3>看到·想到</h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>在愛多亞路自　火街某廣東小吃舖門口，掛有一張「　週紀念特別大犧牲」的「犧牲品」的價目表。的確很便宜。但在表的一角，却小小的寫着這麽一條：「物價飛漲，不得巳每種暫加　角」見之不禁啞然。原來要賣這「犧牲品」，還有「每樣加X角」的條件！幸虧看得仔細，否則要想塌便宜貨還不是被便宜貨塌了去？</p>
<h3>優美的舞姿</h3>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「陸軍監獄。」趙四顯然已經去過幾次了。袁紹文這一次的被判十六個月，在別人固然都覺得很詫異，可是他自已的心理，却是最明白不過的，幸而他還是一個現役軍人，而且袁寳藩也並不眞想替季兆雄報仇，只是怪他不該太偏向秋海棠，為了他竟不惜把自已的馬弁殺死，所以要他多少受一些磨折。但紹文畢竟已是一個旅長的身份，犯的又不是什麽大罪，因此行動雖然失了自由，但起居却還相當舒適，根本並不坐牢，只和典獄長做個淘伴而已；同時袁寳藩在表面上也不願做得太顯，依舊天天打發家裏人送菜送飯的來侍候他。</p>
<p>趙四引着玉崑一進陸軍監獄，便毫不費事的在一間會客室裏和紹文見面了。</p>
<p>「七爺，這一次眞累了你！」玉崑先撿在頭裏說，可是心上不免覺得有些奇怪，他想這個樣子那裏還像坐牢的犯人啊？紹文懶洋洋地躺在一張籘椅上。</p>
<p>「別人特意要我這樣休息休息，還有什麽累不累呢？」他這麼一說，玉崑心理就明白了。「你才從天津來嗎？玉琴的傷口怎麼樣啦？」「快好了，」玉崑說：」他心裏覺很過意不去。」紹文苦笑了一笑。「我才對他過意不去咧！他耍我辦的事，什麽也沒有替他辦好…。」（一二三）</p>
<h3>關於職工教育</h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>記得是去年，重慶敎育部曾經通過一個關於推廣職工補習敎育的決議；這決議中有這樣一條：「由省市，就重要都市，盡量增設工商職業補習學校外，並會同各業領袖，組織各業補習敎育推行委員會，令由各大工廠·公司。商店及各同業公會附設職業補習學校。」</p>
<p>我們認為敎育部的這個決議是針對着現實的。因為事實告訴我們：我國的工商業一向是落後的，這當中當然包含社　性質問題，但除此之外，還應該說是對技術問題的研究與修養小够；當此增加生產與國防建設的目標之下，廣泛地來推行職工補習敎育，大批地培養各業技術幹部是刻不容緩的工作。</p>
<p>就上海方面說，近年來，職業補習學校的增多，正如雨後春筍；而許多公會，業餘團體，公司商號等也都響應起來。單就南京路五大公司來講，就有三家設有補習班的。……這些，都表示出職工敎育問題已普遍地被人們注意起來了。</p>
<p>但道還祇是量的發展，假使我們用質的尺度來量一下的話，那還不能使人滿意；這祇要看各補習學校及其他補習班的成績就可以知道，譬如說，起先總是學員滿室的，但日子一多，郤一個個的溜跑r，這當中的問題固然非常複雜，但基本的問題該是主持者對於職工敎育的特性不能把握。在這里，我就管見所及，發表一些意見，敬希大家指敎。</p>
<p>（一）首先要弄淸楚的是職工的求學不同於一般學生的求學，這就是因為職工已是社會的生產者，他們有職業環境的限制：所以反過來講，要職工求學，必須同時給職工以求學的條件時間與空間的。具體地講，就是一方面不要因求學而妨碍業務，另方面也不要因業務而限制了求學；醫如有許多早晨五時起身，夜里十二時睡覺的學徒們，試問他們有什麽時間來求學呢？所以我認為各公司商號對於求學的職工們應在可能範團內給予某些便利。</p>
<p>（二）正因為職工不同於一般的舉生，所以在敎授法上也大可研究，顯明的特點是職工們都在實踐中，並且大多數都已脫離學校生活很久，因之，像一般學校里的教授法，如照書本上解釋一遍，背書等等是不能適用於職工方面的。而是應多與他們的實際生活配合起來，來提高他們的學習興趣，達到學而致用的目的；這樣說起來，為職工敎師的非熟悉然職工生活的不能勝任了。</p>
<p>（三）在敎材內容上，除了以實用為骨幹之外，我們還應該放些能啟發職工們的國家民族觀念…等的村料，醫如國文不能完令護應用文，最好能選些適時的文選，換換口味，使他們不能感覺苦燥與無味。</p>
<p>（四）集體學習巳成為最好的學習方法，因之，在職工方面也可用得，最好有一定的時間給他們共同討論與研究，這對於學習興趣與效果上都會有很大的收穫。</p>
<h3>有飯大家吃</h3>
<p>— 石秋野</p>
<p>—現實問題之一</p>
<p>十二時了，廚房內格外忙起來；飯－桶桶地盛起，熱氣騰騰，菜一碗碗地排着，葷素齊備。廚司忙得不亦樂乎，把牠們一一的分配着，預備送到賬房間車間內去。</p>
<p>突然，六個修布女工，衝進了廚房，一聲呼喝，手快脚快，一桶飯和四碗菜，被她們帶走了，廚司對這個不意的襲擊，驚得目瞪口呆，等賬房間得報而去修布間干涉時，飯與菜巳被她們狼吞虎嚥地，吃得所餘無幾了。她們的理由是：男工旣加薪，搖紗間女工也得同樣待遇，而修布間早早提出要求，何以不予滿　答覆？她們現不加工錢，則由廠方供給　食．</p>
<p>經理先生不在，飯叉被吃了，只得按下再談。她們吃了飯，把殘餚送下來，機笑　在嘴邊。</p>
<p>經理先生還不回來，時光却不肯等待他而又到進晚餐的時候了。廚司驚魂方定，惴惴地不敢開飯，先去賬房間請不，賬房先生說：「大家挨餓一會，等經理回來再開能！」但是，修布女工則因為巳達晚飯時候，你們不開，則自己動手，又乘虛撲人廚房，揭鍋取飯，開櫥端菜，廚司聞訊回救，可是衆雌聲勢洶洶，雙拳不敵四手，將奈之何？又祇任得她們去。</p>
<p>賬房問即刻全體出動，下令討伐，於是展開了激烈的舌戰，女工們似早有訓練，她們中的二個，站在最前綫應戰，兩個在左右翼相助，還有兩個，看守修布間內的飯菜，負着保衛大後方的責任。一塲脣槍舌劍，未有結果，女工仍回修布間進膳。</p>
<p>次日，經過了再度的談判，她們和男工們得到了同樣的待遇，於是搶飯的舉動，也就停止了。</p>

<h3>電影與游藝界</h3>
<p>— 寳俊</p>
<p>值得回顧的一篇流水帳</p>
<p>自從聲片盛行以來，歌唱和電影似乎就有了不解之緣，在銀幕上早已成為普遍的揷曲</p>
<p>歌舞</p>
<p>與電影界的關係，至為密切。昔日明月社的四大天王—</p>
<p>王人美，黎莉莉，薛玲仙，胡茄，都展開過水銀燈下的生活。還有今日的紅星周璇，白虹，英茵，龔秋霞等，皆係由歌舞團健將，而蛻化為正式電影演員的。過去中國的歌舞片，已有芭蕉葉上詩，人間仙子，三星伴月，雲裳仙子等。</p>
<p>話劇</p>
<p>與電影本是一種姊妹藝術，所以舞台工作人員與電影從業員間，彼此相互幫助。如過去金山，王瑩，趙丹，袁牧之等，甚至以同一步伐走這二條藝術之路。戰後這傾向更趨濃厚，巳從舞台躍上銀幕成名者，如唐槐秋，顧也魯，舒適，周起，鄭重，夏霞，藍蘭，賀賓，黃河，丁芝，屠光啟，孫景璐，陳琦，慕容婉兒，周芻，奚蒙等外，最近活躍的還有韓非，沈敏，喬奇等數人。至於以舞台劇改編成電影的，有雷雨，日出，原野（森林恩仇記），葛嫩娘，李香君，巡按（狂歡之夜），湖上的悲劇（女鬼），慾魔，茶花女，醉生夢死（搖錢樹），新梅蘿香（花開花落）女子公寓等。現在，金星攝製中的「花濺淚」和美成籌備中的「洪宣嬌」，也都是舞台上獲得最高評價的各作。而不久前，天風劇團上演的「十字街頭」，却是根據電影改編舞台劇的。</p>
<p>平劇</p>
<p>搬上銀幕最早者，為梅蘭芳的「天女散花一，那時還是國產電影萌芽的初期，由商務印書館附設的國光影片公司攝製的。周信芳和譚富英在銀幕上各演過「斬經堂」和「四郎探母」，霄菊朋和少朋慧珠曾合攝過一部「娘敎子」。其他平劇上銀幕的，尙有「五花洞」（四潘金蓮），「周瑜歸天」，「林冲夜奔」，及待映的「古中國夕歌」。脫胎於平劇的影片，有乞丐千金（鴻　禧），　湘秋雨（臨江驛），英烈傳（鐵弓　），雪艷娘（一捧雪），蘇三艷史（玉堂春），王寳　，楚覇王等。明星中，王熙春，寗萱是劇影雙棲，袁美雲，童月娟，李麗華，本係女伶出身。</p>
<p>申曲</p>
<p>拍成電影，整部的先後巳有二部，一為賢慧媳婦，一為恨海難塡，都是筱文濱主演的。穿揷在片中者，則有「歌兒救母記」中筱文濱和小筱月珍合唱的「比海棠」。近來上海滬劇社在皇后劇院演出的改良申曲，與電影界亦極有關係。</p>
<p>大鼓</p>
<p>在銀幕上，胡蝶早於明星公司攝製的「啼笑姻綠」片中，唱了一國「黛玉悲秋」；藝華的「影城記」也有大鼓的穿揷。但正式的大鼓上銀幕，却是劉寳全的「寗武關」。</p>
<p>滑稽</p>
<p>也上過銀幕，王元能江笑笑演過「到上海去」，劉春山，江笑笑，鮑樂樂，盛呆呆，陸奇奇，陸希希，丁鳳英合演過雞鴨夫妻」，張冶兒，周空空等也曾在銀慕上施展過滑稽姿態。還有以前享有北派滑稽盛名的秦哈哈，曾改名秦桐而在影圈活躍。</p>
<p>蹦蹦戲</p>
<p>在銀幕上有過自玉霜的「海棠紅」；粵劇有過　覺先唐雪卿的「歌台艷史」。彈詞的運用釗電影裏去，則以不久前金星的無花果」中所揷的開篇「木蘭詞」「埋玉」「記得詞」為第一砲。越劇至今未上過銀幕。至於電影上把平劇歌舞滑稽等一網打盡的，也有過部什錦片「遊藝大會」。</p>
<p>沈敏一上海藝社演康祖藝攝</p>
<h3>劇影交響曲</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>時情片旣抬頭，按理該是國產　影重上正軌的機會，可惜沒有創作的好劇三，所以還是流於低級趣味中。據說：國華最近將攝「黑貓」「古屋魅影」，但看劇名，就可知道內容趨向封建和迷信的色彩了。我們並非反對攝製這類電影，但至少，劇作者應該注入配合時代的正義感，才不負電影敎育的使命。</p>
<p>粵語片雖能在上海感受－般廣東人的歡迎，原則上還是破壞國語統一。最近，又將繼「賊王子」後，運米一部陳雲裳主演的，「風流皇后一，我們希望「下不為例」了。</p>
<p>中旅劇團在劇木荒中，而且覺得由歷史劇與西洋劇也難博到觀衆的歡迎，所以預備遣人到香港去，設法幾部新的創作劇本，因為我國著名的劇作家宋之的陳白塵尤競等等，現在都在香港呢！</p>
<p>李綺年繼「風流寡婦」後，將同時主演「現代靑年」與「賊美人」，「現代靑年」是馬徐維邦所編導者，「賊，人」仍舊是由葉逸芳編劇李萍倩導演以及原班人馬演出。</p>

<h3>Victorious Battle in Southern Shanxi: Chinese Troops Break Through Japanese Encirclement; Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Losses from Repeated Blows; Chinese Guerrilla Activities Spread the War Northward</h3>
<p>According to information obtained here in Beiping, the Japanese army has not achieved a complete victory in its operations in southern Shanxi and has suffered considerable losses. Many Chinese troops have broken through the Japanese encirclement, and the war has now extended to central Shanxi Province. Simultaneously, guerrilla warfare in northern China has suddenly become active again. On Sunday, a passenger train north of Baoding was destroyed by a landmine, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. At Liulihe, 40 miles south of Beiping, 200 guerrillas attacked and drove out the Chinese soldiers trained by the Japanese. Two small towns north of Beiping were also attacked by guerrillas, and the Pinghan Railway tracks were destroyed. Local Japanese newspapers report that 20,000 Japanese troops, supported by aircraft, are currently conducting a large-scale campaign to suppress guerrillas in northern Hebei Province. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>According to recent war dispatches from Chongqing, the Chinese army continues to achieve victories in fierce battles in Shanxi Province and southern China. Heavy fighting is currently taking place in the Taihang Mountains of southeastern Shanxi, in the area of Changzi and Gaoping. The Chinese army has also achieved a victory in the Dahu Mountains northwest of Fuzhou, luring the Japanese army into the mountains and then launching a counterattack on May 30, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tongpu Railway: Destroyed by Chinese Forces</p>
<p>Reports from Luoyang, Wenxi, and Linfen indicate that approximately 20 miles of the Tongpu Railway has recently been destroyed by Chinese forces. The Japanese army has been unable to use the railway for several days, making supply difficult and causing great anxiety. (Dispatch of the 1st)</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan Repeatedly Capture Key Points</p>
<p>Chongqing military news: (1) Chinese troops in northern Hunan launched an offensive against the Japanese, capturing Yanglusi on the evening of the 27th and attacking Qianzunping on the morning of the 29th, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers and destroying Japanese liaison facilities. They also captured a portion of military supplies. (2) The Chinese troops that captured Dahu, northwest of Fuzhou, are pursuing their victory and have now reached Guanyuan. (3) A certain unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese north of Nanchang the night before, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers. That evening, a portion of the Japanese army harassed the Yunshan area but was repelled by the Chinese. (4) In southern Hubei, the Japanese, who had advanced from Tongshan and other places towards Damu Mountain, were defeated by the Chinese. The Chinese forces then pursued the retreating Japanese, who fled towards Tongshan, Maqiao, Niutou, and other places. (5) On the 27th, a portion of the Japanese army at Mushigang on the Hubei-Jiangxi border attacked Hutian, while Japanese troops at Wangjiapu harassed Leigongtang, but both attacks were repelled by the Chinese army.

<h3>"June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Meeting: Full Text of Chiang Kai-shek's Address: Successful Implementation of the Six-Year Plan Makes the Opium Prohibition of Great Significance; With the Spirit of Thoroughly Eliminating Evil, We Should Completely Eradicate the Remaining Poison</h3>
<p>Chongqing On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued the full text of his address to the "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Meeting: "This year's June 3rd Opium Prohibition Commemoration is held after the completion of the government's six-year opium prohibition plan and the implementation of absolute prohibition, which makes it particularly significant. National construction requires relieving the people and bringing them peace, and regaining our national pride and seeking strength especially depends on a strong determination. If we are slightly negligent and allow the remnants to revive, it will not only bring disgrace to our nation but also fail our heavenly duty. I sincerely hope that all party, government, and military personnel at all levels, local gentry, and compatriots across the country will uphold the determination to thoroughly eliminate evil and the responsibility of every citizen to defend the country. We must continue to eradicate the hidden and dormant remnants to achieve fundamental eradication. We should also fight vigorously to thoroughly eliminate the policy of poisoning the people and ensure that the solemn territory of China will never again have the existence of poisonous seedlings and evil weeds, and that the descendants of the Chinese nation will become new people with strong bodies and minds, promoting the cause of our ancestors and leading the nation to revival. We have great expectations for everyone to work together." (Dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<p>Guiyang Today is the "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day. The Provincial Mobilization Committee, considering that Guizhou Province has suffered from opium poisoning for decades and this year marks the deadline for absolute prohibition, has launched a grand commemoration throughout the province. The atmosphere in Guiyang is particularly enthusiastic. The conference was held in the afternoon, presided over by Wu Dingchang, who reported, stating briefly: (1) The greatest reason for the prosperity of Guizhou Province in recent years is the opium prohibition. (2) President Chiang followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and implemented the Party's policies. At a time when the country is at war and facing extreme financial difficulties, he did not hesitate to sacrifice 70 million yuan in annual tax revenue in Guizhou Province alone to thoroughly eliminate opium poisoning. His painstaking efforts for the country and the people are truly moving. If we do not immediately quit, how can we be considered human? (3) From now on, either there will be Guizhou without opium, or there will be opium without Guizhou. Huang Shouru and Tan Kemin then delivered speeches, passing a resolution to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang before adjourning the meeting. The Pacification Headquarters also approved the execution of 28 opium offenders in the city and various counties today, including 18 people who operated opium dens, 5 people who cultivated opium, 2 people who relapsed, and 3 people who transported opium. In addition, the Mobilization Committee has set the 4th to 6th as the dates for a general inspection to eliminate opium. (Dispatch of the 3rd)</p>

<p>According to various sources in Chongqing, the casualties from yesterday's Japanese air raid were higher than any other this year. There are many factors for this, and it is difficult to explain in a few words. Many bombs were dropped in the densely populated area on the north bank of the Jialing River, opposite Chongqing, causing many casualties. Several bombs landed near the YMCA, and its affiliated cinema was destroyed. A bomb also landed in front of the Xinmin Daily, damaging the wall. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Civil Court of Chongqing heard a case in which a Chinese landlord accused his German tenant, Van Lato, of causing his house to be bombed. The landlord claimed that during air raid alerts, the German tenant would hang the flag of the German Nazi Party on the roof, and Japanese aircraft would repeatedly bomb the area around the house. The court stated that the case should be transferred to the Air Defense Headquarters, but before a ruling could be made, an air raid alert suddenly occurred, and everyone fled to the air raid shelters.

<h3>The New Situation in the Eastern Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Crete, one of the three cornerstones of the British defense triangle in the Eastern Mediterranean, has now been officially declared fallen. When the Italo-Greek war broke out last November, Britain, in order to ensure its lifeline in the Eastern Mediterranean, aided Greece with land and air forces to resist the Italian advance southward. Simultaneously, Britain launched an offensive against the Italian Empire in Africa. Subsequently, with repeated naval victories against the Italian fleet, Britain occupied Crete in one fell swoop. Thus, Cyprus to the east, the Alexandria naval port to the south, plus the newly occupied Crete, formed a tripod, shielding the Suez Canal, as well as the Near East, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>
<p>However, the situation shifted. After Germany and Italy occupied the entire Balkan Peninsula, they continued to advance, aiming to dismantle the British Empire by occupying Arabia via Turkey and Syria. This would allow them to strike the rear of the Suez Canal and extend the war to the Middle East, forcing British forces to rapidly withdraw from the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, when the Anglo-Iraqi conflict erupted a month ago, the world's attention was focused on Turkey and Syria, holding its breath for Britain's defense of the Middle East, even its outer defenses of India. Strictly speaking, the sudden outbreak of the Battle of Crete was somewhat unexpected and comparatively favorable to Britain. Its significance lies in: First, it demonstrated Turkey's firm stance against the German and Italian proposal to pass through and partition the Near East and Middle East. Second, although international developments may still present sudden twists, logically, Germany and Italy's determination to occupy Crete at any cost may aim beyond merely shaking British hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean. They may be attempting to open a new route from Crete to Cyprus to French-held Syria, extending into the Middle East while striving to avoid infringing upon Turkish territory to prevent possible friction with Turkey and Syria. If this is the case, it is indeed of great significance.</p>
<p>According to dispatches from around the world over the past two days, Germany and Italy's future target in the Eastern Mediterranean is largely the British-held Cyprus. Therefore, two points are worth concerning: (1) What will be the success or failure of the German-Italian offensive on Cyprus? (2) How will it affect the overall war situation?</p>
<p>To understand the first point, we must first consider the experience of the Battle of Crete. In terms of area, Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean after Sicily and Sardinia, so its support capabilities for the defending forces are greater than Crete. In terms of location, it is closer to the British air force bases in Egypt and Palestine than Crete, while further away from the German air force bases in mainland Greece. Therefore, the overwhelming air superiority that Germany and Italy enjoyed in Crete may not be replicated over Cyprus. In terms of military preparedness, it is the largest British naval and air force base other than Malta, and certainly not comparable to Crete, which Britain and Greece hastily defended. These are the differences between it and Crete. However, the most fundamental point is that it is also an island isolated in the sea, so the only possible way for Germany and Italy to attack Cyprus is to concentrate their forces and conduct a blitz from the air. The overwhelming air superiority of the German and Italian air forces, based on the experience of the Battle of Crete, forced the British to abandon it. The British army also never sent large-scale reinforcements, which ultimately doomed its fate. Shortly after the start of the Battle of Crete, Britain announced the withdrawal of its air force, and by the end, 15,000 British troops had also withdrawn voluntarily. This, compared to Germany and Italy's willingness to attack at any cost, shows that Britain did not have the determination to defend with all its strength. Of course, the final success or failure of this European war on both sides may ultimately be determined by resources and economy, and military advances and retreats are secondary, let alone the loss of a foothold? In the past, Britain withdrew its troops four times under similar circumstances: from Norway, Dunkirk, Italian Somaliland, and the Balkans. The abandonment of Crete is the fifth time. Therefore, in the event that Germany and Italy launch an all-out attack on Cyprus, whether Britain has the preparation and actions to concentrate its forces and engage in a decisive battle will be the most critical factor in determining victory or defeat there. In addition, it should be pointed out that after the heavy sacrifices in the Battle of Crete, the intensity of the future attack on Cyprus by Germany and Italy will inevitably be reduced to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>In the event of a war in Cyprus, the entire Middle East, the Eastern Mediterranean, and even Africa will experience a very fierce battle. On the German and Italian side, its left wing will start from the Balkans via Crete and attempt to occupy Cyprus and Syria, advancing directly towards Suez and the Red Sea. Its right wing will pass through Italian-held Libya in Africa and attempt to break through Egypt and reach Suez. This is nothing less than a huge so-called "pincer movement," attempting to dismantle the British Empire's power in this area. On the British side, it now has two most favorable points: First, Italy's power in Abyssinia has been almost completely wiped out. Second, the anti-British faction in Iraq has been largely eliminated. These are the most reassuring things for Britain at the moment, and they form the most prerequisite conditions for Britain to engage in any effective resistance in this area. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall war situation, the stability of the two rear areas of Abyssinia and Iraq is much more important to Britain than the gains and losses of Crete.</p>
<p>Finally, there is another question: What will be the position of British-held Malta, which lies on the German and Italian right wing, in the future battle? Whether Germany and Italy will launch a simultaneous blitz on it will be answered by future events.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Form Special Task Force: Prepares to Implement Atlantic Escort; Unlimited Appointment of Navy Vice Admirals Bill Passes House: Prelude to Large-Scale Cooperation Between British and American Navies</h3>
<p>Washington The House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill requested by the government, authorizing Roosevelt to appoint special naval vice admirals for "special or extraordinary" naval duties that cannot be explained. The bill did not limit the number of naval vice admirals. The House also sent the bill, which had already been passed, to the Senate. Acting Secretary of the Navy, Bader, wrote to the House stating, "The goal of this bill is to allow the President to simply assign any naval officer to perform special duties or command any naval fleet and organize fleets to carry out special or extraordinary matters, so that they can obtain the title, salary, and allowances of a formal naval vice admiral during their tenure." There has been speculation here that this move is intended to build a "special task force" within the Navy so that the United States can implement escorting for Britain in the Atlantic. Some believe that the bill is a prelude to increased cooperation between the British and American navies. The British Navy has many vice admirals, and any American naval officer who cooperates with British naval officers should have the same rank. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Approves Priority Manufacturing for Military Orders from Democratic Nations</h3>
<p>Hyde Park President Roosevelt signed a major mandatory priority manufacturing law last night, giving the government the power to restrict civilian industrial products. This move places the United States' massive production organizations under a wartime system. Previously, only products ordered under contracts signed by the Army and Navy had priority. Now, the government has the power to prioritize products ordered by various democratic countries and government agencies. Civilian essentials deemed urgent by national defense officials can also be given priority. This bill is one of the most drastic actions taken by the government, supplementing the President's recent declaration that the nation is in an unlimited emergency. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Military Department Requests President to Be Granted Power to Requisition Industries Necessary for National Defense</h3>
<p>Washington Senator Reynolds, Democratic Chairman of the Senate Army Committee, introduced a bill yesterday proposing to grant President Roosevelt wartime privileges, allowing him to requisition "property of any kind or nature," including factories, ships, patents, and tangible and intangible assets. Secretary of War Patterson wrote to House Speaker Rayburn, urging the passage of the bill. Rayburn immediately referred the bill to the House Army Committee. It is alleged that Congress may quickly pass it. The War Department stated that the bill had been approved by President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox, explaining that the bill would place all property under "requisition" and would authorize the President to take over armaments factories and patents necessary for important military supplies for any reason related to national defense. The President would also have the right to nationalize them. The President would also be able to requisition ships, docks, railroads, farms, and various other facilities. He could also sell the acquired property and rights under conditions he deems satisfactory. However, the U.S. government must pay "generous compensation" for the requisitioned property.

<h3>Large Quantities of U.S. Military Supplies Will Be Transported to Chongqing Via Burma; Planned to Supply China with One Hundred Long-Range Bombers; American Aviation Personnel Already En Route; Ishii Believes U.S. Action Is Unfriendly to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo "Miyako Shimbun" reported reliable sources from Washington, stating that the U.S. President Lines has dispatched a group of navigation experts to Rangoon to prepare for the transportation of large quantities of military supplies to Chongqing via the Burma Road. The report also cited sources in New York, stating that a large number of American pilots and aircraft are already at sea, being transported via Rangoon to Chongqing. The report also said that the United States plans to supply General Chiang Kai-shek with at least one hundred long-range bombers. These bombers will be equipped with American pilots and technicians who will fly these aircraft to Chinese bases deep inland. However, the American pilots and technicians will mainly participate in technical matters and will not participate in military operations. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Ishii, a spokesman for the Tokyo Information Bureau, commented on news reports from Singapore, Shanghai, and other places, stating that some U.S. Army pilots are currently going to Chongqing to serve the Chinese government, saying that if this news is true, it is an unfriendly act towards Japan. The spokesman also said that the Japanese Consul General in Singapore stated that if this news is true, it is simply a waste of personnel and materials. This statement resonated with me. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo The "Japan Times" and "Guangzhi Bao", both run by Japanese in Tokyo, commented on an editorial in the New York Times, stating that according to Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, Japan would participate in the war if the United States went to war with Germany. They also stated that the New York Times had obviously not studied the Japanese Foreign Minister's statement in detail. Foreign Minister Matsuoka had made it clear that Japan would have to participate in the war in accordance with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact after a German-U.S. war broke out, and this had been clearly stated to the American newspapers. The report also stated that Japan welcomed the United States to resolve its policy in the Pacific with a practical attitude. The so-called practical attitude meant abandoning interference in Japan's problems in China and the economic pressure it exerted on Japan, as these problems were prerequisites for a Japanese-American understanding.

<h3>New Diplomatic Steps by the U.S. - Enhancing Sino-American Friendship - Another Clear Evidence - U.S.-Japan Relations Will Become More Tense - Guo Taiqi to Arrive in Manila Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It is learned that the newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi will arrive in Manila within days, planning to change his route to Chongqing, bypassing Hong Kong, and instead going to Singapore and Yangon before arriving in Chongqing. Yesterday, local newspapers prominently published the exchange of letters between Guo Taiqi and U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding the U.S.'s intention to relinquish consular jurisdiction in China when peace and order are restored, unanimously calling it another evidence of enhanced Sino-American friendship. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>The "Sweeping Newspaper" of the Army organs commented that "Only countries like China and the United States have the qualifications to speak of coexistence and co-prosperity." The newspaper also pointed out that the U.S. had previously recognized China's tariff autonomy and is now advocating the abandonment of special rights in China, truly symbolizing the close cooperation between these two major powers on the Pacific coast in the future. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Although American newspapers, due to more urgent events elsewhere in the world, did not all write editorials criticizing Secretary of State Hull's remarks about the future relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China, they all considered it a step in the right direction and something that China deserves. Considering the long-term war of resistance, China has already established its independence. Hull's remarks are undoubtedly a major event in the history of Sino-American relations. The Republican "Baltimore Sun" stated that Hull's letter is something Japan should carefully consider. The letter is another amazing guarantee of American friendship and trust towards China, which will surely excite the Chinese government and people. Japan has recently repeatedly expressed its desire to achieve a certain resolution in Asia. This letter now gives Japan an opportunity to reconsider its position, as it should feel that it has presented principles and procedures upon which the U.S., China, and Japan can properly manage things. (Washington Star) believes that this is a diplomatic step that will intensify the tension between the U.S. and Japan. It is expected that new tensions in U.S.-Japan relations may not be far off. Hull's letter will satisfy China's sentiments, strengthen the position of the Chongqing government, and demonstrate the purity and selflessness of the ten-nation diplomatic goals in the Far East. At the same time, this letter is also a blow to Japan because it contradicts Japan's policy of aggression. After Hull issued this letter, the export control regulations were implemented in the Philippines, and Japan and the Dutch East Indies are in a tense situation due to failed negotiations. It is speculated that the overall situation may change within a few days. The strong stance of the Dutch East Indies towards Japan is probably due to the support of Britain and the United States.

<h3>Dutch East Indies-Japan Negotiations - Indicate No Further Concessions - Japanese Proposals Have Not Been Replied To - Tokyo Newspapers Urge Government to Deal Sternly</h3>
<p>Batavia - Recently, Japanese newspapers have been complaining that the Dutch East Indies is deliberately delaying its commercial negotiations with Japan. This move has only caused the Dutch East Indies to decide today to be even more unyielding in the negotiations. The Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies and chief negotiator with Japan, Mook, declared, "If the commercial and economic relationship is viewed by the Dutch East Indies as a belligerent and Japan as a neutral, then there will be no misunderstandings or disharmony." At the same time, the government is still strengthening its defenses and has authorized the accelerated conscription of the 1923 class of militia for basic training. Industrially, the Dutch East Indies has rapidly started new war industries and hopes to achieve self-sufficiency. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>The spokesperson for the Tokyo Information Bureau stated while hosting news reporters today that the talks in Batavia have reached a critical stage, and we may receive a reply from the Dutch East Indies authorities to Japan's proposals in the near future. It is understood that the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, submitted Japan's final proposals to the Dutch East Indies government on May 7th, but no reply has been received to date. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Miyako Shimbun" and "Hochi Shimbun" are both unable to tolerate the "hostile" attitude displayed by the authorities of the Dutch East Indies in their economic negotiations with Japan. They strongly urge the Japanese government to abandon its indecisive policy and begin to deal with Batavia with a stern plan. "Hochi Shimbun" advises the Dutch East Indies authorities to give solemn consideration to the final conditions that they received from Japan, stating that this decision is not just about the success or failure of the talks, but about the safety of the South Pacific. Both newspapers stated that the Dutch East Indies authorities' foolish stubbornness is due to the support of the United Kingdom and the United States, and they falsely believe that Britain will ultimately defeat the Axis powers. Miyako Shimbun also stated that the recent visits of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter to Batavia are also related to this, as the Dutch East Indies authorities' attitude towards Japan has become stronger since then.

Other powers recognize the work they must participate in in the Pacific, and the Dutch East Indies authorities have ample opportunities to carry out practical national defense. The Foreign Minister of the National Government also telegraphed the newspaper, stating that China and the Dutch East Indies have always maintained a mutually beneficial relationship, which is based on the free promotion of both people and mutual respect between the two sides.

<h3>U.S. Invents Typhoid Vaccine</h3>
<p>Washington - Dr. Tom Parran, Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, announced yesterday that the department under his jurisdiction had made special achievements last year, namely the invention of a "typhoid prevention vaccine." This vaccine is made using chicken embryos using a new method and seems to be able to prevent the occurrence of typhoid fever. He said that this vaccine has not yet been tested in the United States because the typhoid bacteria in the United States are different, and typhoid fever in the United States is a sporadic disease rather than an infectious disease. Dr. Parran said that he had sent this vaccine to the UK and 20,000 doses to Spain, Romania, Germany, and China, but had not yet received reports on its effectiveness. Dr. Parran said that this vaccine is very effective for monkeys, so it should also be effective for humans. After the last war, there were approximately 10 million to 35 million cases of typhoid fever, so if we can have an effective preventive agent, it will be of great benefit to the world.

<h3>Two Axis Leaders Confer - Future Strategies for Attacking Britain - Second Stage of Actions in the Mediterranean - Planning for American Intervention</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, each leading their respective foreign affairs authorities, at the Brenner Pass yesterday is very significant as it indicates the need for continued coordination between the two Axis powers. Italy, which has been listening to Germany for many months now, undoubtedly Mussolini and Ciano were summoned to that location to listen to Hitler's new instructions. More than three months have passed since Hitler last personally met with Mussolini. It is noteworthy that the official news about this meeting was first released by Rome. London is not certain about the purpose of this meeting, but it is generally believed that Mussolini is less likely to gain anything from this meeting compared to usual. Given Vichy's servility to Germany, Italy's continued demands to extort France are unlikely to receive Hitler's support. Furthermore, it is even more doubtful whether Hitler will satisfy Mussolini's hopes of profiting from the spoils when Hitler arbitrarily carves up territory. Hitler's gift to Italy may be limited to awarding the Croatian crown to the Italian King's nephew. Radio Lyon reported that Hitler and Mussolini discussed for five hours, only taking a short break for lunch. German General Commander Keitel and Italian General Commander Cavallero also attended the meeting at one point. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to a report from a Haitong News Agency reporter, German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass yesterday for five hours. This was the tenth meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. In addition to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German General Commander Keitel and Italian Chief of Staff Cavallero also participated. The meeting was adjourned at noon, and the six had lunch together. General Keitel and General Cavallero discussed the issue of military cooperation between Germany and Italy. The important Axis officials at the Brenner Pass in recent days included Dr. Dietrich, head of the German intelligence department, Bormann, Secretary-General of the Nazi Party, Bismarck, the German Chargé d'affaires in Italy, and General Rintelen, the German military attaché in Italy. The Italian side included Alfieri, the Italian ambassador to Germany, General Gontini, a key member of the General Staff, General Marras, the Italian military attaché in Germany, and the head of the Diplomatic Corps, Celesia. Hitler and Mussolini held their tenth meeting amidst frequent reports of victories by the Axis joint forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa.

<h3>The Focus of the Brenner Talks - A Prelude to the Invasion of Britain</h3>
<p>Rome - The two Axis leaders met at the Brenner Pass yesterday. It is widely believed that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini discussed the second stage of Axis operations in the Mediterranean following the British defeat on Crete. Following the Axis victory on Crete, a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was widely expected. Italian newspapers generally regarded the Battle of Crete as a prelude to another battle about to unfold in the Mediterranean region. Most observers believe that future actions were the main topic of discussion yesterday. According to official announcements, there was complete agreement on all points during the meeting. It is widely believed that during yesterday's meeting at the Brenner Pass, Hitler and Mussolini decided whether the Axis forces would invade Britain in the summer or advance eastward in the Mediterranean towards the Suez Canal. Apart from the official announcements, the main topic of the meeting remains an official mystery. The possibility of the Axis powers sending landing forces to attack Britain has resurfaced following the success of the Battle of Crete. Some observers believe that the attack on Crete may have been a "small-scale test" for the invasion of Britain. Italian newspapers openly declared that the Axis forces would pursue the British Mediterranean fleet eastward. The meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was shrouded in even more mystery. Observers also stated that the meeting took place shortly after President Roosevelt's "fireside chat." Axis newspapers generally believe that President Roosevelt's speech indicates that the United States is preparing to join the current war soon. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Have Drafted a Plan to Resolve the Greek Territory</h3>
<p>Rome - It was reported yesterday that Hitler and Mussolini have drafted a plan to resolve the Greek territory. It was also heard that the two leaders discussed President Roosevelt's determination to defend the Western Hemisphere and its implications for French West Africa, Cape Verde Islands, and the Azores Islands. (International News Service, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - This afternoon, Tokyo newspapers speculated about the great significance of Hitler and Mussolini's meeting, paying particular attention to possible actions in the Near East and towards the United States. Asahi Shimbun pointed out that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany recently participated in Axis meetings, indicating that the Brenner Pass meeting between Hitler and Mussolini may have great significance for Japan.

<h3>British Soldiers Retreating to Egypt - Extremely Miserable Conditions - Barefoot and Wounded - British Aircraft Provide Cover for Retreat</h3>
<p>Cairo - Imperial and foreign troops, covered in blood-stained rags, mostly barefoot and/or with wounds, returned here yesterday from Crete, ready for the next act of the Mediterranean war. These soldiers were transported from the beaches by British warships, while German and Italian aircraft bombed heavily overhead, forcing British soldiers to seek refuge in seaside caves. The number of soldiers rescued was 15,000. The difficult and dangerous task undertaken by the British army cannot be fully described in words. Souda Bay has been occupied by Axis forces, so rescue operations had to be carried out by destroyers, taking place on the beaches at night. One young officer said, "Crete is unrecognizable after two weeks of fierce fighting. The villages are just piles of ash, and the fields are full of rotting corpses. Chania has been removed from the map. The German attack on Souda Bay was fierce. German soldiers poured in, and the dead piled up like flies, but those who arrived later continued to come." (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Cairo - The British Air Force in the Middle East issued a communique yesterday stating that large formations of British fighter planes and South African aircraft continued to provide cover on Sunday for British warships and merchant ships evacuating British troops from Crete. They intercepted enemy aircraft repeatedly throughout the day, forcing them to retreat before they could attack British ships. In addition to the seven enemy aircraft shot down reported in Sunday's communique, two enemy aircraft were destroyed on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday night, British bombers attacked the Maleme and Heraklion airfields in Crete, setting off fires in several locations. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed at the Maleme airfield, and several other enemy aircraft were destroyed elsewhere. In addition to engaging in protection and attack activities, the British Air Force also dispatched bomber planes during the retreat to drop medicine and food to supply isolated British troops in various parts of the island.

<h3>New Zealand High Commissioner Praises New Zealand Troops for Bravery</h3>
<p>Wellington - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser broadcast a telegram from Egypt last night, stating that "In view of the difficult circumstances faced by the New Zealand troops, I feel that they have done their duty. This is not only my personal opinion, but General Wavell and the authorities here also believe that the New Zealand troops have performed exceptionally well." He also stated that most of the healthy soldiers and mobile wounded have likely been evacuated from Crete. Fraser did not estimate how many New Zealand troops remain on the island. Fraser praised the Navy's assistance in evacuating the New Zealand troops. Acting New Zealand Prime Minister Nash declared that the Battle of Crete was clearly a delaying action with great value in relation to future wars. He also said that he would convene Parliament next week to inform them of the information the government has obtained. New Zealand Governor-General Walsh sent a telegram to General Freyberg, who commanded the troops on Crete, expressing his respect and conveying his condolences to his subordinates. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Melbourne - Australian Prime Minister Menzies spoke about the events on Crete yesterday, praising the bravery of the Australian soldiers. He said that the authorities have taken various steps to send troops and equipment to the Middle East for reinforcements. The troops withdrawn from Crete were more numerous than expected. The Battle of Crete has overturned the German timeline, strengthened our ability to protect the vital area of Egypt and the Suez Canal, and allowed us to stabilize the situation in Iraq by mobilizing troops. However, the current danger is great, and we must be determined to deal with it. There is absolutely no reason for pessimism. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Goering Praises Paratroopers - Achieved a Glorious Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Marshal Goering issued a commendation order to the German troops on Crete yesterday, stating that "Now there are no islands that cannot be conquered." In the short history of our country's air force, a glorious masterpiece has now been completed. Our paratroopers and air force, under the leadership of officers of all ranks, working together with their army comrades, have achieved a rare victory. You paratroopers have displayed your fearless spirit, defeating an absolutely larger enemy with a smaller force. Since the Battle of Narvik in Norway, the air force has cooperated with the mountain troops, and now it has conquered an important island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Comrades, the entire Germany expresses its infinite admiration and gratitude to you." Finally, Marshal Goering expressed his gratitude to the German troops who sacrificed themselves on the island and to the Italian troops who assisted in the battle.</p>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers commented on the end of the Battle of Crete, believing that the island has an important strategic position. After the German army occupied the island, Britain's prestige suffered a great blow. Currently, the island has become a German base in the Eastern Mediterranean, and German aircraft can attack Alexandria more easily. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Announces Clearing British Troops on Crete</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to responsible authorities here, after German forces in Crete were ordered to carry out the work of clearing out the remaining British troops, the clearing operation was completed within 24 hours. British troops in an area near Sfakia made a final stand before surrendering, with a total of 3,000 British troops captured. The rapid completion of the clearing operation was largely due to the air force, and there were very few mountain caves on Crete that could be used for escape, so clearing was easy. Now the island will become a new base for the German Air Force. The next task will be to attack the British fleet off the coast of the island and Egypt, and the second step will be to bomb Alexandria and the Suez Canal. British ships bombed in the past week are as follows: May 27, a British aircraft carrier was hit by four bombs, two cruisers were hit and destroyed; May 28, a heavy cruiser, a destroyer, and an oil tanker were each hit and caught fire; May 29, a British patrol boat was damaged; May 29, two British destroyers were sunk; May 31, a destroyer was severely damaged; June 1 and 2, one destroyer each was damaged and sunk. From this, it can be seen that the British fleet's voyage between Crete and Egypt is no longer free. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Construct New Defense Zone on the Left Bank of the Nile; Germany Suffers Heavy Losses in the Battle of Crete; Britain to Vigorously Defend Cyprus</h3>
<p>Cairo, Egypt, the Ministry of Defense announced the establishment of a new defense zone west of the left bank of the Nile, named the "Cairo West Defense Zone." Radio operators from the mechanized border defense forces assigned to this area will receive special allowances. It is widely believed that this demonstrates the Egyptian army's emphasis on the transportation routes in this region. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London, a Reuters military commentator stated that the loss of Crete is indeed a temporary setback, but we can learn valuable strategic and practical lessons from it. We firmly believe this can be done. Strategically speaking, the lack of air bases was our weakness in defending Greece and Crete. The British failure to seize the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea months ago to build airfields seems to be an unfortunate oversight. Tactically, Crete's defenses and airfields were inadequate, and the estimated strength of the garrisoned forces was incorrect. However, despite these shortcomings, the defense of Crete remains a glorious and great achievement, a brilliant page in the history of the British Army and Navy. The invading German forces have been severely punished, suffering heavy losses in manpower and aircraft. Whether this will significantly affect German military strength remains to be seen. The next problem is protecting our Alexandria naval base and the Suez Canal, and the defense of Cyprus is also extremely important. We must take full steps to ensure the security of Cyprus. The issue of air power will again be the decisive factor. Unless Germany first devastates Turkey and gains a foothold in Syria, the German air force's attacks on Cyprus will not be as unbridled as they were in Crete. Hitler is currently trying to gain a foothold in Syria. Therefore, many French soldiers stationed in Syria who hate the Nazis and are ready to join General Trugny should be given various incentives, such as encouraging the Free French forces currently stationed in Palestine and Egypt to move directly towards Beirut and Damascus. If so, the British Air Force should protect the Free French forces from attacks by German aircraft stationed in Syria. The time has come for resolute political action, even at the risk of danger, because defending Cyprus requires the friendly assistance of Syria. The situation in Iraq has greatly improved. The rebellion launched by Rashid Ali under Nazi direction has finally collapsed. Britain has thus gained another route for supplying goods to India and a source of oil, and can thereby connect the Arab nations with Britain and ensure the security of the Allied rear. All of this is of great strategic value. The end of the Abyssinian war is also a powerful factor in defending Egypt, as it not only secures Egypt's back door but also allows a large contingent of British troops to be transferred north from Abyssinia. General Wavell may now have sufficient strong forces to launch an offensive against Libya before the enemy forces can be reinforced. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Nazi Troops Land in Latakia, Syria; Syrian French Authorities Actively Deploy to Counter British Attacks</h3>
<p>Ankara, according to reliable sources, Nazi troops have landed in Latakia, Syria. These German troops are all wearing tropical helmets and the long boots worn by African troops. The German Chief of Staff was at the port to greet these troops, numbering over five hundred. British military sources say that the Nazi attempt to break through the British blockade between the Dodecanese and Syria is extremely important for the future. The British naval patrol, attempting to capture transport ships with only one night's sailing distance, finds its work particularly difficult. The first confirmed news of the German landing in Latakia came from an official from a neutral country. Military experts believe that Cyprus is the second target of the Nazis in the Mediterranean, the first being the replacement of losses of aircraft, and they will soon begin to remove naval obstacles that are slightly less important than Crete. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London, Pete, a Columbia Broadcasting Company representative stationed in Turkey, reported that in the past five days, the number of German aircraft flying eastward from their new Aegean bases to Syria has greatly increased, with some saying it has reached two hundred.

<p>Beirut, the French authorities in Syria are actively taking various measures to prevent a British attack.

According to unconfirmed official reports, German troops landed in Mosul when the British-Iraqi war was fierce, but it is widely believed that there is German Fifth Column activity there.

<h3>Winant Returns to the United States on a Mission; Carries Peace Proposals; Scheduled to See Roosevelt Today</h3>
<p>Washington, an official from the State Department told reporters that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant's return to the country is only to exchange views on the current situation with government officials.

<p>Washington, well-informed sources here believe that when U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant returns to the United States to report on his duties, he will report to President Roosevelt on Germany's peace proposals. Official and unofficial speculation suggests that Deputy Führer Hess may have presented these peace proposals. It is generally believed that Winant is the only logical person to convey these proposals and news of the British reaction to President Roosevelt. Winant is scheduled to go to the White House tomorrow to confer with the President. The British silence on the "Hess affair" suggests that Hess may have made such proposals.

<h3>The Democratic Front Will Ultimately Triumph; Hopkins Writes Analysis</h3>
<p>New York, Harry Hopkins, the administrator of the Lend-Lease Act, wrote an article published in the July issue of "American Magazine." Based on the following four facts, he concludes that Hitler will ultimately fail: (1) He lacks true sea power; (2) He is gradually losing air superiority; (3) His economic resources cannot compete with those of Britain and the United States; (4) The United States will never allow Hitler to consolidate his unjust gains, as this would conflict with American interests economically, politically, and morally. Hopkins said, "I do not underestimate Hitler's military organization, which remains the strongest in the world, but its bomber force is now gradually turning from strength to weakness, while the number of British bombers is gradually increasing. Britain is now rapidly advancing and, with our assistance, will catch up with and surpass Germany in a year." Hopkins also praised the British spirit, saying that even if British civilians suffer ten times the bombing they have already endured, it will not break the British people's will to fight, as the British have become indomitable. Hopkins mentioned the necessity of maintaining Britain's maritime lifeline, saying that American naval patrols are being deployed to prevent raiders or submarines from wreaking havoc on the United States in this hemisphere. For its own interests, the United States must send the war materials that its economic power can produce to the Allies and safeguard the world's sea, land, and air forces. The United States has decided on a policy of fully assisting democratic nations, and this assistance must be given immediately and without reservation. Hitler is strong, but the democratic nations are even stronger. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Freeze Axis Deposits Because They Were Emptied in Advance</h3>

<p>The Municipal Council's foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel, loaded with 5,000 bags from Hong Kong, arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at its own wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice is still limited, due to the weakening of foreign rice prices, sentiment is consistently bearish, and the price fell by 1.2 yuan. Kunshan fresh japonica was 134 yuan, and ordinary japonica was 132 yuan and 130 yuan. Fresh Nanhang early and late rice was 136.7 yuan, and original bags were 140 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is also softening. The sales floor has only some scattered demand, and sellers are also easing their intentions. Selling prices have been depreciated by about 2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan was 113 yuan and 111 yuan, special glutinous rice was 115 yuan, glutinous tea was 105 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 102 yuan and 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Noodle Market is Weak</h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market, after falling the day before, has been impacted by falling rice and oil prices. Actual sales are hesitant, and new wheat will soon be on the market. The selling pressure in the market is very strong. Jinlong brand Kampong flour first fell to 29 yuan. Australian flour once held up, but eventually became unsustainable. In the afternoon, Zhonglou brand was trading at 29.8 yuan. Bank-stored rice flour was also soft at 29.2 yuan for Paotai brand American flour, down 5.6 yuan from the previous day. Total transactions were 5-6,000 bags. Foreign flour also continued to arrive yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel, loaded with 1,500 bags from Hong Kong, arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at its own wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Today, there were 600 bags loaded on the Anqing Wheel heading to Xiamen.</p>
<p>There were no transactions in wheat. Although new wheat from the mainland and nearby has been released, shipments to Shanghai are still pending. Old wheat inventories in Shanghai are already low, but there is still plenty in the mainland, but it cannot be exported due to transportation difficulties. There may be many twists and turns in bringing this year's new wheat to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New White Beans Seen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new broad beans with white skin from Jiading were seen as samples. The quality of the crop is similar to that of the green broad beans. According to industry insiders, the beans are thin and small due to damage from spring snow, rain, and hail, which hindered their development. These beans have not yet been shipped to Shanghai because the transportation permits have not been issued. It was rumored yesterday that a batch of uncertified goods were inquired about by Japanese merchants for a price of 35 yuan. Green broad beans are still from Beigang, priced at 42.8 yuan per disk. Hong Kong and Quanzhou merchants handled over 300 bags. The price of soybeans has depreciated. Tianjin soybeans are priced at 48 yuan, with Hong Kong merchants handling over 3,000 bags. Mujie distributed 200 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of 46 yuan, and over 400 bags of Guide soybeans at prices ranging from 45.2 to 45.5 yuan. This morning, 930 bags of soybeans and 200 bags of shelled peanuts were shipped to Xiamen, and another 280 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore. A large amount of corn has also arrived in Shanghai. The Java mail steamers Zhigen No. 2 and Zhishali arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, bringing over 30,000 bags of corn from Java, which were unloaded at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf. Yesterday, 2,500 bags of corn were loaded onto the new Beijing steamer for shipment to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Frequently Rise and Slightly Fall</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds continued to strengthen yesterday. However, after a six- or seven-day rally, prices eased slightly in the afternoon. The situation may not necessarily take a sharp turn downwards. Most of the sellers were covering their positions, with more new short positions being opened. If there is any support, the market will not be easy to underestimate. Yesterday morning, most of the sellers on Jiucheng, Yitai, and Runli were covering their positions. Hengkang, Hongda, and Xinfu added to their long positions. Xiexing, Wuxie, and Kangda were mostly long positions closing out. Xinhua and Yongkang slightly sold off. Class C bonds were quickly hoarded at 8 yuan, reaching a high price of 8.4 yuan. Class B bonds also broke through the 70 yuan barrier. Few people paid attention to Class A bonds, and they failed to follow the upward trend, remaining at their original price. In the afternoon, Hongda, Xinfu, Defu, Xinchang, Dade, and Yongkang all bought in, but the selling pressure was stronger, and prices retreated slightly as soon as they rose, but the decline was limited. Lianhe, Tongshun, Yichang, and Lianyi were all selling off one after another. Prices retreated slightly by one or two jiao in the afternoon. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which fell slightly by two jiao, the rest still rose by two or three jiao, but Class A bonds only rose by five fen. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.5 million yuan. A brief summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 93 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 23 yuan each.</p>
<p>The public stock market was slightly softened in a very stable environment. Transactions were still scarce, and both operators and suppliers felt uninteresting.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Monday) dispatch: Today is a British holiday, and the securities market is closed for the day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Selling Intention Re-emerges; Yarn Market Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had rebounded the previous day, showed a slight weakness yesterday. This was because speculators, seeing that the upward trend had subsided, revived their intention to sell. As a result, a group of sellers shorted the market, and the market slightly retreated. However, although actual sales were not smooth, they were more active than before. At the same time, raw materials were not willing to fall significantly, so some people still bought in when prices fell. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1455 yuan, and the low price was 1435 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial transaction price was 1430 yuan. Midway through, due to good bid prices, it rose to 1436 yuan. Due to the activity of short sellers, it fell to 1427 yuan, and the final price was 1430 yuan. Currently, some people in the yarn market say that it may hover between 1430 and 1450 yuan. Today, 25 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Penang.</p>
<p>Shuangma yarn opened in the morning, continuing the firm momentum from the previous day. Unexpectedly, the opening price was high, and the public called for selling. As a result, the market was not responsive. The initial price was 1450 yuan, and it soon rose to 1455 yuan. However, there were many sellers, and the market quickly softened to 1442 yuan. But it fluctuated for a long time between 42 and 43 yuan. Around 12 o'clock, the momentum suddenly weakened, with rumors of peace, and the closing price fell to 1435 yuan. It is found that the turnover in half a day was 8,300 bales, including 300 bales purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 8,000 bales by domestic merchants.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Although there is no large-scale development in the current cotton trade, people's confidence can still be maintained. Because overseas prices are not falling, the public still has high hopes for fine-grade raw materials. With appropriate prices, there are occasional fluctuations, so although consumption is limited, market prices remain unchanged. However, ginned cotton is in a slump, and it is still difficult to hear any news of its recovery.</p>
<p>Another report: The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has recently been severely affected by the yarn market and factories. At the same time, the international situation is deteriorating. As a result, all parties seem to be reluctant to purchase in large quantities, but the market situation is still quite stable. Yesterday, traders traded 200 bales of Brazilian cotton at around 450 yuan, which were transshipped to Qingdao.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is sluggish and unremarkable. Yesterday's closing price rose slightly by three to five points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is closed. It is also predicted that the opening market today will fall by about two rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>The market trend for factory cloth was slightly firm yesterday, and the popularity was stable. Therefore, the selling prices of various cloths turned from falling to rising. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth continued to be purchased by Nanyang merchants, and each lot rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The June futures for 16-pound Caihua Butterfly Group cloth opened at 49.5 yuan, which is 7.5 jiao higher than the current market price. Fugui fine cloth opened at 42.75 yuan in the morning, and fine twill at 39 yuan. It slightly recovered in the afternoon, and all rose compared to the previous day. The street traded about two hundred pieces of various cloths. Nanyang merchants purchased over two hundred pieces of Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth, coarse twill, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 9 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Xiamen, another 100 pieces to Singapore, and 20 pieces to Penang.</p>
<p>The market price of Dongbu cloth remains in a state of fluctuation. In the current market, because there are not many warehouse receipts, the selling price in the morning is particularly tight. In the afternoon, the futures of the exchange's leading products fell by six or seven jiao, and the current goods were also affected by it. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth factory orders was 44.55 yuan, and Sijunzi serge was 1.41875 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Fungus Tightens Again</h3>
<p>Recently, the black fungus market has become more active, and the quoted price has become firmer again. For example, Sichuan fungus is quoted at over 800 yuan, and Hekou fungus is quoted at over 760 yuan. The market price is also following closely, and there is hope for further increases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Futures Are Difficult to Save; Continue to Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening price for raw white sugar futures showed a slight rebound, but it still fell gradually afterwards, and the downward trend was difficult to reverse. Moreover, the far-term price was lower, which was a reversed situation, indicating that the sharp decline seemed not to be over yet. The association's quoted price for spot goods was: 24 raw white sugar for old goods arriving in January was 90 yuan, down 1.3 yuan; new goods arriving in May was 91.6 yuan, down 3 yuan. The June 10th futures opened at 95.2 yuan in the morning and closed at 94 yuan. In the afternoon, it opened at 94 yuan and fell to 92 yuan, down 2.8 yuan. The June 20th futures were 94.4 yuan to 93.3 yuan in the morning and 92.9 yuan to 91.2 yuan in the afternoon, down about 4 yuan. Newly arrived Dutch red sugar futures fell to 73 yuan, a decrease of 8 yuan compared to last Monday. Taikoo vehicle white sugar was relatively flat, with the Western warehouse price at 103.5 yuan, with little fluctuation. Yesterday, 1,620 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Recently, the supply of medicinal gorgon fruit has been insufficient, and the market inventory has been decreasing day by day. As scarce goods are more valuable, the price has been rising steadily. The market price for white skin medicinal gorgon fruit was quoted at 160 yuan yesterday, and it was sold for over 156 yuan. However, red skin goods were not selling well and showed signs of softening. It has fallen from 120 yuan to 115 yuan, and the next grade is 110 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Few Buyers for White Coal</h3>
<p>The price of white coal has been gradually decreasing in this off-season of summer. There is only falling and no rising. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the price fell even more drastically because the owners released large quantities of goods to liquidate their holdings. After the price of coal balls increased, it rebounded slightly, but it was also the end of its strength and was unable to do anything. This is the general trend. Yesterday, Tongdeli white coal was shouted out at 430 yuan by traders, but there were few buyers. It is said that new goods will arrive soon, and the long-term outlook is not good.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Soap Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The soap market is mediocre. Although factory prices have increased, few local customers are purchasing, and hoarders are watching. Recently, Guben soap is priced at 53.5 yuan per case, Baixiangmao at 44.5 yuan per case, Arrow Knife soap at 42 yuan per case, and Henry Love soap at 42 yuan per case, all without change. Huangxiangmao is priced at 42.5 yuan per case, and transactions are relatively active. The candle market has increased again, but it is difficult to change the market buying price because sales are concentrated in rural areas and usage decreases in summer. For example, ship candles are priced at 27.4 yuan per case, which is slightly higher than before.</p>
<h3>Peanuts (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Now, various countries around the world have an increasing need for peanuts, because they are indeed a very precious thing. It—who doesn't know this?—whether fried, boiled, deep-fried, candied, or salted, there is no way of eating that is not delicious and satisfying! It is truly suitable for both sweet and savory, and welcomed by both the old and the young! Therefore, in many kinds of candies and pastries, there are its beautiful silhouettes adorning them. As for the oil extracted from it, it can be eaten, burned, used to make soap, lubricate machines, and recently even used to make "margarine"... Moreover, even the residue left over from pressing the oil is an excellent fertilizer for feeding livestock or fertilizing fields: you say, it should occupy such an important position in agriculture, industry, commerce, or people's daily use!</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the results of chemical analysis—numbers omitted!—the nutrients contained in peanuts far exceed those of soybeans, fish, and meat! This lovely "long-life" fruit, if we can enjoy it as much as possible, it is hard to say that it can really make us live forever, but at least it can make our lives a little longer. It is probably not too much to say! However, this lovely only gift to the common people, which before the war could be bought in considerable quantities for one or two cents to satisfy one's cravings, is now a bit "too high to reach"! Oh my god! "Who gives us 'long life'?"...</p>

<h3>Various Circles Commemorate Anti-Smoking Day Yesterday, Embracing the Spirit of Rejecting Drugs, Automatically Assisting the Government in Eliminating the Atmosphere of Poison, Smokers Vow to Quit, Strengthen the Body, and Strengthen the Country</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 102nd anniversary of Lin Wenzhong (Zexu)'s burning of opium in Humen. It was designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day. All sectors of the public in Shanghai, in order to assist the government in promoting the prohibition policy and revitalize the national spirit, made concerted efforts to promote the anti-drug movement. The First and Second Higher Courts burned confiscated drugs, and various groups issued letters to smokers, urging them to wake up immediately, quit their habits voluntarily, save unnecessary expenses, and restore their healthy bodies. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Pledging to Obey the National Policy and Work Together to Reject Drugs</p>
<p>Yesterday was "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Day. The National Government believes that the harm of opium and drugs is more serious than floods and fierce beasts. Once addicted, it can make people spiritless, ambitious, and trapped, causing physical harm. Therefore, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the National Anti-Smoking Committee was established. President Chiang was appointed as the Anti-Smoking Supervisor to stipulate a three-year drug ban and a six-year smoking ban. It was originally hoped that within this time limit, opium and drugs would disappear from all parts of the country. Therefore, local governments vigorously implemented the policy. Except for the rear areas during the war, which had been eradicated last year, the occupied areas, due to special circumstances, had the opposite effect, and the spread of opium and drugs was even more serious than before the promotion of the anti-smoking policy, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of smokers. The anti-smoking policy failed, so the whole country is deeply vigilant, and vows to respect the national policy and jointly promote the anti-drug movement, so that they can make persistent efforts to eliminate opium and drugs as soon as possible, rescue smokers from the depths of misery, strengthen their bodies, save unnecessary consumption, and strengthen the country.</p>
<p>The Court Follows the Routine and Burns Drugs</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the First Special Zone District Court, in order to complete the prohibition policy and implement "Rejecting Drugs to Get to the Root" and "Rejecting Drugs to the Utmost," have adopted the strictest criminal law for opium and drug cases in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The police authorities also take their work seriously, taking the elimination of opium and drugs in the area as their duty. Therefore, the two courts hold burnings of confiscated opium, drug items, and utensils on Anti-Smoking Day to show their intention to promote anti-smoking and commemorate Anti-Smoking Day. Yesterday, the work of burning opium and drugs was carried out as usual. In the future, the punishment of opium and drug offenders will strictly comply with the recently promulgated regulations on punishment by the Ministry of Justice, in order to achieve the purpose of eliminating opium and drugs.</p>
<p>Smokers Awaken and Strive to Quit</p>
<p>Various groups in the wooden market issued a letter to all smokers in the city yesterday to commemorate Anti-Smoking Day, saying, "On June 3, 1839, Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Huguang, burned 20,000 boxes of imported opium in Humen, Guangzhou. Because of the incompetence of the Qing government at that time, opium and drugs continued to spread in the country. The British psychologist Hall said, 'One cannot create a first-class country with third-class nationals.' 'With a golden age of physique, there will be a golden age of culture thirty years later.' These short words fully illustrate that health is the key to the strength of a country. During the current period of resistance and construction, we should especially cherish our bodies, conserve our energy, and strive for the country and the nation. Make persistent efforts and show their inner strength. Know that addiction to opium and drugs can lead to the demise of lofty ambitions, spiritual decline, physical loss, and thought constraints, but our government does not suspend the prohibition policy due to the war. Opium and drug criminals will still be punished with strict criminal penalties, and it is stipulated that repeat offenders will be severely punished in the future. Smokers throughout the city, this is how dangerous it is. You should quit as soon as possible and start over as a good citizen, carry forward your own cause, and undertake the responsibility of revitalizing the country and the nation, so as not to be ashamed of the lessons taught to us by Lin Wenzhong and Chairman Chiang one after another."</p>
<p>Lide Society Encourages Self-Awareness and Awareness of Others</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lide Friendship Association issued a statement to the public saying,</p>
<p>"The issue of anti-smoking in our country has gone through a long period of effort. Anyone who cares about the future of the country cannot but think of the seriousness of this issue. Because if opium and drugs are not eliminated, the adverse results can hinder the normal evolution of society and destroy the safety of the nation's life. The issue of anti-smoking in our country is in fact an issue with interlocking political and diplomatic relations. It is a method of undermining our national spirit and national consciousness. However, the issue of anti-smoking is a serious issue concerning social security and the life and death of the nation. It is a simple fact that is easy to see and should be done in the present. On today's isolated island full of poisons, we must raise the banner of national consciousness, arouse public attention from an objective and rational perspective, and be aware of ourselves and others. Eliminating opium and drugs, this minimum hope, is a request and a gift that we make to the citizens in commemorating June 3rd Memorial Day."</p>
<h3>The Xiafei Wheel Sailed Directly to Haiphong Yesterday, Without Stopping Along the Way; The Coolidge Wheel Will Arrive in Port Tonight and Sail to Hong Kong Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Marshal Xiafei, a new ship of the French Mail Steamship Company that recently joined the Shanghai-Defense route, arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of last month after loading tribute rice from Defense. It was originally intended to moor in Shanghai for four days before loading cargo and sailing to Defense. However, due to a telegram from Saigon, the trip was postponed, which caused speculation from the outside world, saying that the Shanghai-Defense route would be suspended. It is now known that the Marshal Xiafei left the No. 11 and 12 pontoons yesterday morning and sailed directly to Haiphong. It did not stop at other ports along the way.</p>

<p>In order to manufacture cars to meet domestic needs, China Automobile Manufacturing Company is striving to manufacture and supply itself. In the previous year, it established a loan with the German Otto Wolff Company, and the German company provided drawings and all technical assistance. Now, China Automobile Manufacturing Company is speeding up automobile manufacturing. The first 2-ton "Daimler-Benz" small diesel truck has been completed and is now driving on the southwest road. Many of these trucks were previously shipped from Germany and run on vegetable oil. It is also understood that China Automobile Manufacturing Company can manufacture all automobile parts itself. According to Otto Wolff Company, a German company, the Shanghai office is located in the Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Company Establishes Office in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Has Arrived in Hong Kong to Prepare</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing went to Hong Kong from Shanghai and then to Chongqing, he went to various places to inspect and implement the industry. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, who inquired about Yu's relatives in Shanghai, Yu is preparing to set up an office of Sanbei Company in Hong Kong and has begun to arrange it. After half a month, it can be completed. Afterwards, Yu will travel between Chongqing and Hong Kong and will not return to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<h3>Xi Yushu Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, Xi Yushu, the Chinese director of the Public Works Bureau, has resigned and gone to Hong Kong. Xi has been a Chinese director of the Public Works Bureau for nearly ten years. Since the reorganization of the board of directors, he has not attended several meetings. People generally worried that Xi had been kidnapped, but now it is known that he left Shanghai last week.</p>
<h3>Re-Evaluation of Land is Suspended</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau, the board of directors of this bureau carefully considered the case of re-evaluating the property in the public concession. As a result, in view of the current abnormal state, it was decided to suspend the re-evaluation. It will be re-examined when the situation returns to normal in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Bank is Established by Lace and Other Industries</h3>
<p>Shanghai Lace and other industries are preparing to establish Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Savings Bank, with a capital of one hundred yuan in national currency.

Once approved by the Ministry of Finance, the founding meeting will be held and the opening date will be announced again.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice is Sold Throughout the City Today; Smuggling of Rice Out of the Port is Found to be Inventory; Group Purchases of Rice Still Require Rice Shops to Handle</h3>
<p>The second batch of small-grained rice ordered by the Public Works Bureau began to be distributed the day before yesterday. More than 20 miscellaneous grain shops that have been assigned to have started paying and picking up goods yesterday. Currently, more than 80 rice shops in the wooden port have seen a sharp increase in the number of citizens purchasing small-grained rice. The distributed rice has been completely sold out and cannot meet the market demand. According to rice industry news yesterday, all rice shops that have sold out the small-grained rice at affordable prices can pick up goods today to meet the market demand. In the future, the agency for small-grained rice orders handled by the Public Works Bureau will try to handle it as quickly as possible and provide sufficient supply to avoid the drawbacks of interruption.</p>
<p>Group Purchases Should Wait for Permission</p>
<p>The current affordable small-grained rice handled by the authorities is agreed upon by the Hong Kong government to provide 200,000 to 250,000 bags per month. Now, in order to allow a large amount of small-grained rice to circulate on the market, in addition to the sale by rice shops without quantity restrictions, agencies, groups, companies, and factories are also allowed to purchase in large quantities. However, the purchase procedures cannot be directly applied for purchase from Liji or Xiangmao. They must still be purchased from retail rice shops, and the retail rice shops must apply to Xiangmao. Only after permission is obtained can the transaction be concluded.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Subject to Penalties Should Pay Quickly</p>
<p>If rice shops do not go to Xiangmao Foreign Firm to pay and pick up goods after the deadline, the Public Works Bureau will immediately cancel their distribution rights. After the news spread, the rice shops applied one after another, and many rice shops have been restored to sales. However, there are still 18 rice shops that have not yet paid. According to Liji Xiangmao Foreign Firm, if these 18 rice shops do not apply again, their distribution rights will be permanently revoked. It is found that these rice shops include 4 in the French Concession, 2 in the central area of the Public Concession, 3 in the Xinzha area and Jing'an Temple area, 2 in the Putuo area, 1 in the Hongkou area, 4 in the Huishan area, and 2 in the Yangshupu area. According to Fukang Rice Shop, the sales of Hong Kong rice have never been interrupted.</p>
<p>Smuggling Exports is Confirmed by the Business Community</p>
<p>According to external rumors, the rice industry knows that the rice prices in the coastal ports of South China are much higher than in Shanghai due to special circumstances. Smuggling foreign rice from Shanghai is very profitable. People in the business community confirmed this statement, saying that the amount of rice shipped out is small and is not the Yangon rice purchased by the Public Works Bureau, but the foreign rice from Saigon and other places currently stored in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Arrested Employees Have Been Released</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association sent a letter to the Director of the French General Patrol Room yesterday, requesting the release of the employees of the rice shop industry. It is heard that they have been completely released. The letter to the Political Department of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau said, "It is found that on May 28 of this year, the employees of the rice shop industry launched a strike to demand improved treatment. Due to the employees inciting strikes to various rice shops, there was a disturbance. The patrol room detained many people. After persuasion, work was resumed on the 29th. The representatives of the employees and the association held talks on May 30 at 4 p.m. The labor representatives put forward two requests: (1) Please assist the capital side in requesting the patrol room to release the arrested employees. (2) Reinstate all employees dismissed during the Dragon Boat Festival this year."</p>
<p>Labor-Capital Negotiations Have Not Yet Been Conducted</p>
<p>The labor and capital sides agreed verbally that the capital side would assist in the request for the first point, and for the second point, the labor side would provide a list and investigate the reasons for the dismissal from the stores and try to mediate. During the talks, the representatives of both sides agreed to negotiate salary increase conditions at the association's meeting hall at 2 p.m. on June 1, but the labor side did not send representatives to attend at that time, so the negotiations could not proceed. However, in order to express its sincerity and avoid the expansion of the labor unrest and disrupt the public order, the association specially reported the progress of the negotiations truthfully, and requested that the department ask the legal department to exempt the arrested employees from prosecution, and notify the patrol rooms to release the employees of the rice shop industry who were detained due to the labor unrest in order to show leniency and enable the negotiations to continue, so as not to cause other incidents."</p>
<h3>Anderson Comes to Shanghai to Take Office</h3>

<h3>US Relinquishes Extraterritorial Rights in China: Promoting China's Strength to Prevent Japan's Abuse of This Privilege, Hindering the Development of Chinese Nationalism</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao comments that US Secretary of State Hull recently declared in Washington that the US will relinquish its extraterritorial rights in China once peace is restored. Those familiar with Sino-American relations will not find this declaration surprising, as they know that the US views extraterritorial rights in China as merely a temporary measure. Furthermore, the US has repeatedly expressed its sympathy and understanding for China's desire to fully govern its own country.</p>
<p>The US Government Planned to Relinquish Rights Early</p>
<p>In fact, the US government had long planned to relinquish its extraterritorial rights in China. However, this was not achieved because other countries refused to follow suit. More than a decade ago, the Chinese actively campaigned to abolish extraterritorial rights for all countries in China. This was halted due to the Mukden Incident in 1931. Japanese aggression is the main obstacle to the growth of Chinese nationalism.</p>
<p>Eager for China to Achieve Its Wishes</p>
<p>However, the Chinese deeply believe that the American people and their government are very</p>
<p>eager to help China achieve its legitimate wish to abolish extraterritorial rights. If Chinese friends in London could express the same sentiment, the Chinese would be even more excited. In fact, this is very possible because in recent years, Britain and the US have often adopted parallel policies in dealing with various issues in the East.</p>
<p>Other Countries Obstructing from Within</p>
<p>Other countries use their extraterritorial rights in China</p>
<p>to interfere in China's internal affairs and hinder China's progress. The main reason why the Chinese people have been slow to understand their own position since the 1911 revolution is that some countries have abused extraterritorial rights.</p>
<p>Relinquishing Special Rights is Self-Defense</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan has used its extraterritorial rights as a shield for its aggression in China. Britain and the US are both aware that Japan's abuse of this privilege not only harms the interests of the Chinese people but also harms the rights of Britain and the US in China. The reason why Western democratic countries are willing to relinquish this privilege is that they hope to promote China's strength, which in turn will curb Japan's ambitions. Japan has long harbored hatred and hostility towards Western countries. Brazilian Minister to China, Mr. and Mrs. Laigo, visited Shanghai briefly and departed for Beiping yesterday on the Kai Ping steamer.</p>
<h3>Advertising Allowed on Rickshaw Backs</h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Public Works Bureau, the Board of Directors of the Bureau approved the application to use the backs of public rickshaws for advertising at its regular meeting on the 28th of last month. However, the following regulations must be followed: (1) All advertisements must first be approved by the Police Department. (2) Paper advertisements are not allowed. (3) The fee for each rickshaw used for advertising is one yuan per month (the fee may be revised by the Bureau at any time). The fee must be paid in advance on a monthly basis, and applicants must report the rickshaw license number to the Bureau. Once reported, the fee will be charged regardless of whether the vehicle is used for advertising or not. The approved advertising license plate must be attached to the conspicuous position of each vehicle. Rickshaw licensees are responsible for paying the fee.</p>
<p>It must be stated that the Bureau does not intend to grant any exclusive rights to applicants for this type of advertising. The Bureau's permission may be revoked at any time. In addition, those who wish to advertise on rickshaws operating in the French Concession should also apply for approval from the French Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Raw Materials for Various Industries</h3>
<p>Spinning Mills and Other Industries Face Operational Difficulties According to a report by the Industrial Section of the Public Works Bureau, the operating conditions of most spinning mills last month were almost the same as before the implementation of electricity restrictions. Thirty managers and engineers from seventeen Chinese-owned spinning mills held a second meeting to discuss methods of saving electricity in order to minimize production reduction and maintain workers' income as much as possible. Several paper mills have extended the workers' bi-monthly holidays to reduce working hours. The price of coarse yarn has fallen sharply, but fine yarn prices remain high. Since the 12th of last month, silver firms have refused to provide loans against cotton yarn, causing panic selling and a decline in the yarn market. Coupled with the Dragon Boat Festival season, selling pressure has increased, further reducing yarn and cloth prices. The woolen industry has been affected due to difficulties in sourcing raw materials and seasonal factors. Only four silk mills are still in operation, but silk weaving mills continue to operate as usual. In addition, printing ink, paint, steel, timber, and rubber industries all face difficulties in sourcing raw materials.</p>
<p>There were 99 accidents in factories, including 11 fatalities. The Industrial Section is actively promoting industrial safety in factories. Last month, 50 factories were found to have improved their equipment. In addition, there were 11 factory fires, resulting in 6 worker deaths and 10 injuries.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Regular Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The regular meeting of the Shanghai Rotary Club this week is scheduled for noon on Thursday, June 5, at the Cathay Hotel. Mr. Li Kangxin, a member of the club who has lived in Hong Kong for three and a half years, will speak on "Impressions of Traveling in the Malay Archipelago," a topic based on his six months of experience in Malaya. Local and out-of-town members who wish to invite friends to attend should call the club secretary (16450) immediately to reserve seats to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Jinan Steamer Declares General Average After Rescue</p>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Company's Jinan steamer, which departed from Shanghai for Hong Kong on May 23, ran aground in the waters off Zhejiang. It has been rescued by a dispatched steamer and safely arrived in Shanghai. The company announced yesterday that the Jinan steamer ran aground en route and incurred various expenses due to the rescue. Therefore, it has declared general average. All cargo has now been unloaded at the company's Pootung godown and will be assessed for damage by Polissen &amp; Davie. The amount of the deposit will be announced later.</p>
<h3>The Practice of the Five Religions and the Exclusive Responsibility of Confucianism</h3>
<p>The 16th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Society was given by Mr. Sun Xiangzhong on the practice of the five religions and the exclusive responsibility of Confucianism, divided into five sections:</p>
<p>(1) The original driving force behind the promotion of each religion: 1. Humanity inherently possesses the entire vitality of the universe, which manifests as the functions of emotion, reason, and will. 2. The initial cause arises from faith, perceiving life beyond the individual. The subsequent result is regarded as a miracle, connecting with all life and achieving self-sacrificing morality.</p>
<p>(2) The evolutionary process of each religion: Religion has no so-called evolution or regression. Its process evolves with culture. 1. Those with lower culture are willing to accept external control and often worship natural objects. 2. Those with higher culture know how to use their own strength to focus on human relations.</p>
<p>(3) The characteristics, similarities, and differences of the five religions: Among the five religions, Confucianism values human relations, Buddhism clarifies the nature of the soul, Taoism venerates the Way of Heaven, Christianity reveres God, and Islam speaks of the True Master. Their teachings mostly focus on moral action. Therefore, morality is the fundamental issue of religion. However, due to slight differences in what each religion reveres, there are many differences in doctrines and tenets.</p>
<p>(4) The exclusive responsibility of Confucianism: 1. In the Han Dynasty, books such as Jia Yi's New Book, Liu An's Huainanzi, and Yang Xiong's Tai Xuan Jing all focused on explaining Confucianism and Taoism. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were harmonized, and the theories became richer. The recent trend of integrating the five religions is indeed a requirement of the times. 2. Confucianism is the backbone of integration. Confucianism carries benevolence, humility, fortitude, and complete virtue. Confucian scholars are good at harmonizing the world. In the court, they correct policies; among the people, they beautify customs. From this, we can glimpse the reality of Confucianism. 3. Confucianism is indeed what humanity needs. Each religion is beneficial to humanity. Within each religion, there is no lack of true Confucianism and Taoism. Therefore, when Confucianism and Taoism are practiced, all religions are practiced. The constancy and dual virtues of Confucianism are vast.</p>
<p>(5) The ultimate goal of humanity: Humanity universally desires universal harmony and ultimate bliss, achieving the unity of all beings. The unity of all beings means non-duality of things, non-duality of body and mind, non-duality of God and man, and non-duality of worldly and otherworldly laws.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun gave an enthusiastic lecture, and the audience listened with great attention, applauding continuously. On that day, the lecture hall combined two rooms into one, yet it was still full, demonstrating the growing interest of the audience.</p>
<h3>Wang Yusen Assassinated on Ximen Road, Xihufang Yesterday Morning: Assailants Entered Bedroom and Opened Fire</h3>
<p>Another shooting murder case occurred yesterday morning within the French Concession. The victim was Wang Yusen, a native of Nanjing, who was shot four times on the spot and died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The details of the murder case are as follows:</p>
<p>From Vietnam to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Yusen, a 52-year-old native of Nanjing, had been running an antique shop in Vietnam. Last October, Wang brought his concubine, Ms. Ma (a 20-year-old native of Nanjing), and two daughters from his previous wife (one seven years old and one six years old) to Shanghai. They immediately rented the front building of the second floor at No. 66 Xihufang, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 40 yuan, and have lived there until now.</p>
<p>Assailants Enter</p>
<p>At around 8:10 yesterday morning, three men in short clothes suddenly entered the alley from Huabei Apartments on Marlang Road. They entered No. 66 through the back door and went straight upstairs. One of the three men, dressed in black silk crepe and about 30 years old, pushed open Wang's bedroom door and entered. The other two men remained on guard by the stairs. The man saw Wang lying on the bed and immediately pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Wang.</p>
<p>Four Bullets Fatal</p>
<p>Wang was sleeping facing outward, so he could not avoid the attack. All four bullets hit him, one each in the left and right chest and one each in the left abdomen. He screamed and collapsed, mortally wounded on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the gunmen fled downstairs with their accomplices and disappeared without a trace. Upon receiving the news, the French police dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and Western detectives to hunt down the suspects, but they were unsuccessful. They then sent Wang's body to the coroner's office for an autopsy and are conducting a thorough investigation into the case.</p>
<h3>Fire on Daxi Road Yesterday Morning: More Than a Hundred Thatched Sheds Destroyed</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 yesterday morning, more than a hundred thatched sheds in Wangjianong, Daxi Road, suddenly caught fire. The Fire Brigade urgently dispatched six fire engines to the scene, and the fire was extinguished at around 8:00 a.m. The thatched sheds were completely destroyed, and the fire spread to five nearby small factories and more than a dozen wooden houses behind the British barracks on Daxi Road.</p>
<p>Fire Also Occurred on Haining Road Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>At around 12:28 yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at No. 208 Haining Road. The flames raged and spread to Nos. 210 and 212, destroying them completely, and also affected the roofs of Nos. 206 and 114. The Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with hose carts and extinguished the fire in about two hours.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Employees Embezzle</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenyu, Li Yunfu, Zhang Bingchun, Wang Yanfang, Gu Maolin, Xin Qingfu, and several other employees of the Tongfeng Le Rice Shop at No. 38 HeDe Road, embezzled rice because their request to shop owner Cao Dade for increased subsidies was denied. The shop owner discovered that 40 bags of rice were missing from the warehouse and reported it to the police. Zhang Wenyu was arrested. Zhang and others admitted to conspiring to embezzle rice because they could not make ends meet, and confessed that they had sold six bags of rice to the Hecheng Rice Shop in Wangjianong, Daxi Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang and others were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Shi ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Perfume Alley Robbery: Pedestrian Robbed Last Night</h3>
<p>At around 8:15 last night, a man was walking through Xiangfen Lane in the Public Concession when he was suddenly stopped by three unarmed robbers. They robbed him of 495 yuan in cash and fled.</p>
<h3>Shen Qiquan's Eightieth Birthday Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shen Hongquan, a former historian from Jiaxing, celebrated his eightieth birthday yesterday (the 3rd). Relatives and friends in Shanghai held a celebration for him at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant. Several hundred people, including Chen Zhilong, Shen Tingqing, and Zhang Yishu, attended. Members of the Pingsheng Opera Society sang a cappella, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Favorable Subscription for Children's News</p>

<h3>Huge Robbery at Post Office: Suspects Arrested, Several Post Office Employees Suspected and Detained, Stolen Funds Returned to Post Office by Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that the main culprits in the huge robbery of 2.5 million yuan from the General Post Office last Saturday morning, one Chinese and one Japanese, were arrested on Sunday. All of the stolen funds have also been recovered. After solving the case, the Japanese authorities continued to hunt down suspects. It is reported that a large number of employees in departments such as the Postal Remittance Department have been closely questioned by the Japanese authorities, as it is rumored that someone in the Remittance Department reported the news when the funds arrived.</p>
<p>Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Approximately 18 people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the case. It is expected that more arrests will be made today (the 3rd). The Japanese authorities announced that all of the stolen funds were found in the residence of the main suspect, Japanese national Masao Nomura, on Shi Gao Ta Road. The suspect had previously worked in a certain unit of the Japanese Army but was dismissed a month ago for dishonesty. The Japanese side is still investigating the case and will return the stolen funds to the Postal Administration after the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation</p>
<p>Regarding the report that police officers from the Public Concession were not allowed to enter Nomura's residence to search, the Japanese authorities claimed that the residence was outside the border of the Public Concession, so police officers from the Concession were not allowed to search it. However, police officers from the Public Works Bureau stated that they cooperated closely with the Japanese side to solve the case but did not intend to search Nomura's residence.</p>
<p>Stolen Funds Returned</p>
<p>In another report, the total amount of stolen funds temporarily held at the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police was returned to the Post Office yesterday morning after Deputy Director of the Japanese Postal Administration, Kinzashi Kin-ichiro, negotiated with the Japanese side. It is also reported that the arrested Liang had lived in Shanghai for more than 20 years and was acquainted with many employees of the Post Office. After Liang learned the news about the large sum of money being transported to the Post Office, he went to Masao Nomura to discuss the matter. They then hired a car from the Dasen Motor Company, driven by driver Dong Liankui (30 years old), to go to the Post Office. Dong was arrested by the Japanese side after the incident, and the entire case was solved easily.</p>

<h3>Resolution of Salary Dispute at Pei Chu Elementary School: No Classes at Zhen Huan Elementary School, Patriotic Le'an Negotiating</h3>
<p>Apart from the satisfactory resolution of the Pei Chu Elementary School dispute yesterday, there are still school disputes in this city that have not been resolved, such as at Zhen Huan Elementary School. The parties involved are mediating separately. The following is a breakdown of the situation at each school, as learned by a Dahua News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Pei Chu Elementary School The dispute at Pei Chu Elementary School on Xiaoshadu Road, Haifang Road, was resolved satisfactorily yesterday with the mediation of the parties involved. The school agreed to pay each teacher a relief allowance of 60 yuan, and the previously issued living allowance will not be deducted. The teachers are satisfied, and the dispute has ended.</p>
<p>Patriotic No. 2 Elementary School The attitudes of both sides in the dispute at Patriotic No. 2 Elementary School on Mai Te He Si Te Road, Aiwener Road, have become closer and are being mediated by the parties involved. A satisfactory resolution is likely to be reached soon.</p>
<p>Zhen Huan Elementary School All the teachers at Zhen Huan Elementary School on Xin Dagu Road, Chongqing Road, made a request to Principal Zhao Boqing on the 29th of last month due to the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods: 1. A subsidy of 15 yuan per person for May and June. 2. The subsidy should be calculated for six months starting next semester. 3. Pay the contract fees before the final exam. The school only agreed to increase the subsidy by 20%, but ignored the rest. The teachers felt that the difference in conditions was too great and difficult to accept. The school then notified the teachers' introducers to individually terminate their employment midway, resulting in no classes being held at the school. The teachers are now petitioning the parties involved for assistance.</p>
<p>Le'an Elementary School The faculty and staff of the private Le'an Elementary School on Kangnaotuo Road, feeling the hardship of life, jointly submitted four requests to the school for assistance. It is reported that the two sides are negotiating sincerely and a solution is likely to be reached soon.</p>

<h3>Guoqiang Middle School Basketball Tournament: Blue and White and Qiangxing Triumph</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of Guoqiang Middle School. The school authorities, considering the current extraordinary times, only held two basketball games as a embellishment in addition to the ceremony. The Guoqiang basketball court is spacious and shaded by green trees, with over a thousand spectators and orderly arrangements. At 4:00 PM, Lexing and Qiangxing took the stage. Qiangxing is composed of junior high school students from Guoqiang Middle School, who are short and nimble, lively and lovely, and their attacks and defenses are swift and clear. As a result, they defeated Lexing by a score of 57 to 38. In the final match, the Blue and White team played against Tongren. Tongren, due to incomplete team members, temporarily enlisted Qiu Xie from Xihua as an assistant. However, the team became a mismatched chariot, and the cooperation was diminished. The Blue and White team had strong players and horses, and Bao Songyuan, Wang Nanqun, and others were as agile as ever. The game became one-sided. In the first half, the Blue and White team won by a score of 39 to 22. In the second half, Tongren's Guanjia Jiang once launched a counterattack, posing a great threat to the Blue and White team. As a result, the Blue and White team was ultimately the better team, defeating Tongren by a score of 72 to 49.</p>

<h3>At a Loss?</h3>
<p>— Shizi</p>
<p>Merchants use "Selling at a Loss" as an advertising trick, which we can often see in department store windows and at the entrance of silk shops. However, seeing a piece of paper with the words "Selling at a Loss" inserted on the counter of a rice store is truly unexpected, especially in this era when rice is as expensive as pearls. Rice merchants are actually willing to endure the pain of "Selling at a Loss," which is indeed "inconceivable."</p>
<p>Rice merchants can "Sell at a Loss," probably out of "sympathy for the people's hardship." Their "enthusiastic and chivalrous spirit" is truly "praiseworthy." Unfortunately, the price listed below the words "Selling at a Loss" on the paper is "102 yuan." Looking at the quality of the rice, it does not seem to be very good. Perhaps this rice has been "resting" in the rice warehouse for a long time. The selling price of Hong Kong rice is only 110 yuan, and the season for yellow plum is approaching, so it is thanks to the special favor of "rice weevils" on the citizens that the rice merchants generously "Sell at a Loss"!</p>
<p>We are not forgetful. Rice prices of 70 or 80 yuan were very recent. Buying at 70 or 80 yuan and selling at the high price of 103 yuan is still being beautifully touted as "Selling at a Loss." It's truly bewildering.</p>
<h3>Starting with "Corpses on the Road"</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>The following news item was published in various newspapers on the 29th of last month (May):</p>
<p>"Due to the threat of rising prices of all goods, the number of poor people starving to death in this city is increasing daily. According to a statement released by the Pushan Yizhuang, from the 1st to the 27th of this month, the Yizhuang collected and buried as many as 2,846 corpses in the public concession area, of which 2,250 were children's corpses and 596 were adult corpses."</p>
<p>However, this reflects the following points: First, the number of poor people in today's social system is undeniably and overwhelmingly large. Coupled with the sharp increase in the cost of living, the number of people starving and dying is also increasing proportionally. And there are countless others who have not died but are struggling with "death" today.</p>
<p>Of course, thorough salvation depends on our efforts to eliminate social injustice. Oppression of others, who are also human beings, and the irrational status quo must be eradicated. However, if someone like a certain capitalist insists on remaining stubborn and forces colleagues who want to sell their labor to earn a full meal onto the path of death and starvation, it will not be condoned by wise people!</p>
<p>Moreover, today, efforts should still be made to "reduce corpses on the road" and maintain social order.</p>
<p>Second, due to the root of hunger, diseases are also generated. This is also a social pathology that cannot be ignored. An article titled "Sending Doctors and Medicine" that I saw in this publication a few days ago further demonstrates the urgent need for this measure today. I hope that our concession authorities can find a way to address this issue as soon as possible. Otherwise, like the "famous doctors" of today, the life and death of patients are irrelevant to them unless money is sent to their door. Fortunately, they themselves are not dying! But the rulers of the concession probably cannot sit idly by and watch the poor die!</p>
<p>Third, there is an even more serious point in this news item, which is that among the 2,846 corpses, children's corpses account for as many as 2,250, accounting for more than 81%. Think about it, all countries in the world are encouraging childbirth and forcing marriage, but in China, in just one corner of Shanghai, such an alarming number appears. This cannot but make people sad, because it is a loss to the Chinese nation. We really should take urgent measures to address this.</p>
<p>If we think further, how many children in this number starved to death, died of illness, or even died unnaturally? But at most, the law only arrests their parents and punishes them, but the law has no way to guarantee their lives and cannot guarantee that their bellies will not be hungry!</p>
<p>Therefore, today, making sure that everyone has food to eat is the most important thing in the world!</p>
<h3>What I Saw and What I Thought</h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>At the entrance of a certain Cantonese snack shop on Avenue Edward VII, there is a price list for "Special Sacrifices for the Anniversary" of the store. It is indeed very cheap. But in one corner of the list, it is written in small letters: "Due to soaring prices, each item will be temporarily increased by X cents." Seeing this, I couldn't help but smile wryly. It turns out that there is a condition for selling these "sacrifices": "each item will be increased by X cents"! Fortunately, I looked carefully, otherwise I would have been deceived by the cheap goods instead of getting a bargain.</p>

<p>"Military Prison." Zhao Si had obviously been there several times. Yuan Shaowen's sentence of sixteen months this time was indeed surprising to others, but he himself was most aware of the reasons. Fortunately, he was still an active soldier, and Yuan Baofan didn't really want to avenge Ji Zhaoxiong. He just blamed him for being too biased towards Begonia, and for him, he didn't hesitate to kill his own orderly. Therefore, he wanted him to suffer a little. But Shaowen was, after all, a brigade commander, and the crime he committed was not a major one. Therefore, although he lost his freedom of movement, his daily life was still quite comfortable. He wasn't really in prison at all, but just kept the warden company. At the same time, Yuan Baofan didn't want to make it too obvious on the surface, and he still sent his family to deliver food and meals to serve him every day.</p>
<p>Zhao Si led Yukun into the military prison, and without any difficulty, they met Shaowen in a reception room.</p>
<p>"Seventh Master, this time I've really troubled you!" Yukun said first, but he couldn't help but feel a little strange. He thought, how could he look like a prisoner in jail? Shaowen was lying lazily on a rattan chair.</p>
<p>"Someone specifically wants me to rest like this, so what's there to be troubled about?" When he said this, Yukun understood. "Are you just coming from Tianjin? How is Yuqin's wound?" "It's getting better," Yukun said, "He feels very sorry." Shaowen smiled bitterly. "I'm the one who feels sorry for him! He asked me to do something, but I didn't do anything well for him..."

<h3>On Employee Education</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>I remember that last year, the Ministry of Education in Chongqing passed a resolution on promoting supplementary education for employees. This resolution included the following clause: "The provinces and cities should, in important cities, increase the number of industrial and commercial vocational supplementary schools as much as possible, and should also work with industry leaders to organize industry supplementary education promotion committees, which should order major factories, companies, stores, and industry associations to establish vocational supplementary schools."</p>
<p>We believe that this resolution of the Ministry of Education is aimed at reality. Because the fact is that China's industry and commerce have always been backward. This of course includes social factors, but in addition, it should also be said that there is a lack of research and cultivation of technical issues. Under the goal of increasing production and national defense construction, it is imperative to widely promote supplementary education for employees and cultivate a large number of technical cadres in various industries.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the increase in the number of vocational supplementary schools in recent years has been like bamboo shoots after rain. Many associations, amateur groups, companies, and shops have also responded. Taking the five major companies on Nanjing Road alone, three have supplementary classes. ... These all indicate that the issue of employee education has been widely noticed by people.</p>
<p>But this is only a quantitative development. If we measure it with a qualitative scale, it is still not satisfactory. This can be seen from the performance of various supplementary schools and other supplementary classes. For example, at first, the classrooms are always full of students, but as time goes on, they run away one by one. The problems in this are certainly very complicated, but the basic problem should be that the organizers cannot grasp the characteristics of employee education. Here, I will express some opinions within the scope of my limited knowledge, and I hope everyone will give me some advice.</p>
<p>(1) The first thing to be clear is that the pursuit of learning by employees is different from the pursuit of learning by general students. This is because employees are already producers in society, and they have the limitations of a professional environment. Therefore, conversely, to ask employees to study, they must also be given the conditions, time, and space to study. Specifically, on the one hand, learning should not hinder work, and on the other hand, work should not limit learning. If there are many apprentices who get up at 5:00 AM and go to bed at 12:00 AM, how can they find time to study? Therefore, I believe that various companies and shops should provide certain conveniences to employees who study within the possible scope.</p>
<p>(2) Precisely because employees are different from general students, the teaching methods can also be studied. The obvious characteristic is that employees are all in practice, and most of them have been away from school life for a long time. Therefore, the teaching methods in general schools, such as explaining from textbooks and reciting, cannot be applied to employees. Instead, we should cooperate more with their actual lives to improve their interest in learning and achieve the goal of learning for application. In this way, teachers for employees cannot be competent without being familiar with the life of the employee.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of teaching content, in addition to using practicality as the backbone, we should also put some materials that can inspire employees' national and ethnic concepts... For example, Chinese language cannot be completely equivalent to applied writing. It is best to choose some timely literary selections to change the taste so that they cannot feel bitter, dry, and tasteless.</p>
<p>(4) Collective learning has become the best learning method. Therefore, it can also be used for employees. It is best to have a certain amount of time for them to discuss and study together. This will greatly benefit their interest in learning and their effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Let Everyone Have Food to Eat</h3>
<p>— Shi Qiuye</p>
<p>— One of the Realistic Problems</p>
<p>It's twelve o'clock, and the kitchen is especially busy. Rice is scooped up bucket by bucket, steaming hot, and dishes are arranged bowl by bowl, with both meat and vegetables. The cook is busy distributing them one by one, preparing to send them to the accounting room and the workshop.</p>
<p>Suddenly, six fabric mending female workers rushed into the kitchen, shouting and acting quickly. A bucket of rice and four bowls of dishes were taken away by them. The cook was stunned by this unexpected attack. When the accounting room reported to intervene in the fabric mending room, the rice and dishes had been devoured by them, leaving very little left. Their reason was: male workers have been given a raise, and the female workers in the yarn reeling room have also received the same treatment. But the fabric mending room had made the request early on, so why not give a satisfactory answer? If they are not given a wage increase now, then the factory should provide food.</p>
<p>The manager was not there, and the rice had already been eaten, so they had to postpone the discussion. After eating, they sent the leftovers down, with sly smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>The manager still hadn't returned, but time wouldn't wait for him, and it was already time for dinner. The cook, his soul just settling down, was afraid to start serving the meal, and went to the accounting room to ask for instructions. The accountant said: "Everyone will have to go hungry for a while. We can only start serving when the manager comes back!" However, the fabric mending female workers, because it was already dinner time, said that if they didn't start serving, they would do it themselves. They once again took advantage of the situation and rushed into the kitchen, lifting the pot to get the rice and opening the cupboard to get the dishes. The cook, hearing the news, rushed back to save the food, but the crowd of females was menacing, and two fists couldn't match four hands. What could he do? He had to let them go again.</p>
<p>The accounting room immediately mobilized everyone and ordered a crusade, and a fierce war of words unfolded. The female workers seemed to have been trained in advance. Two of them stood on the front line to fight, two others assisted on the left and right wings, and two others guarded the rice and dishes in the fabric mending room, responsible for defending the rear. The verbal battle did not yield any results, and the female workers returned to the fabric mending room to eat.</p>
<p>The next day, after further negotiations, they received the same treatment as the male workers. As a result, the act of grabbing food stopped.</p>

<h3>Film and Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Bao Jun</p>
<p>A Retrospective Worth Revisiting</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of sound films, singing and film seem to have an inextricable connection. On the silver screen, they have long become a common interlude.</p>
<p>Singing and Dancing</p>
<p>Have a very close relationship with the film industry. In the past, the four great stars of the Bright Moon Society—</p>
<p>Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Xue Lingxian, and Hu Jia, all began their lives under the mercury lights. And today's red stars, Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Ying Yin, Gong Qiuxia, etc., are all transformed from singing and dancing troupe members into formal film actors. In the past, Chinese singing and dancing films included Poems on Banana Leaves, Fairy of the World, Three Stars Accompanying the Moon, and Fairy in Cloud Clothes.</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<p>And film are inherently sister arts, so stage staff and film workers help each other. For example, in the past, Jinshan, Wang Ying, Zhao Dan, Yuan Muzhi, etc., even took the same steps on these two artistic paths. After the war, this tendency became more intense. Those who have jumped from the stage to the screen and became famous include Tang Huaiqiu, Gu Yelu, Shu Shi, Zhou Qi, Zheng Zhong, Xia Xia, Lan Lan, He Bin, Huang He, Ding Zhi, Tu Guangqi, Sun Jinglu, Chen Qi, Murong Wan'er, Zhou Chu, and Xi Meng. Recently, there are also several active artists such as Han Fei, Shen Min, and Qiao Qi. As for stage plays adapted into films, there are Thunderstorm, Sunrise, Wilderness (Forest Feuds), Ge Nunnang, Li Xiangjun, Circuit Censor (Night of Revelry), Tragedy on the Lake (Female Ghost), Lust Demon, Camellia (Money Tree), New Melancholy (Flowers Bloom and Fall), and Women's Apartment. Now, "Flowers Splashing Tears," which is being produced by Jin Xing, and "Hong Xuanjiao," which is being prepared by Meicheng, are all works that have received the highest praise on stage. Not long ago, the play "Crossroads," performed by the Tianfeng Troupe, was adapted from a film into a stage play.</p>
<p>Peking Opera</p>
<p>The earliest to be put on the screen was Mei Lanfang's "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers." That was still in the early days of the germination of domestic films, and it was produced by the Guoguang Film Company, which was affiliated with the Commercial Press. Zhou Xinfang and Tan Fuying each played "Chopping Jing Tang" and "Si Lang Visits His Mother" on the screen. Xiao Jupeng and Shao Peng Huizhu once co-produced a "Mother Teaches Son." Other Peking Operas on the screen include "Five Flower Caves" (Four Pan Jinlian), "Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven," "Lin Chong Flees at Night," and the yet-to-be-released "Ancient Chinese Evening Song." Films adapted from Peking Opera include Beggar's Daughter (Hong Lixi), Sorrowful Autumn Rain (Linjiang Station), Biography of Heroes (Iron Bow Edge), Xue Yan Niang (A Handful of Snow), Su San's Amorous History (Jade Hall Spring), Wang Baochuan, and King of Chu, etc. Among the stars, Wang Xichun and Ning Xuan are both opera and film actors, and Yuan Meiyun, Tong Yuejuan, and Li Lihua were originally female opera singers.</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera</p>
<p>There have been two full-length films made of it, one is Virtuous Daughter-in-Law, and the other is It's Hard to Fill the Sea of Hatred, both starring Xiao Wenbin. Interspersed in the film is "A Singer Saves Her Mother," with Xiao Wenbin and Xiao Xiaoyuezhen singing "Than Begonia." Recently, the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Troupe's performances of improved Shanghai Opera at the Queen's Theatre are also very related to the film industry.</p>
<p>Drum Ballads</p>
<p>On the screen, Hu Die sang a "Daiyu's Sorrowful Autumn" in the film "Tears and Laughter," which was produced by the Mingxing Company. Art China's "Film City Record" also had drum ballads interspersed in it. But the formal appearance of drum ballads on the screen was Liu Baoquan's "Ning Wu Guan."</p>
<p>Comedy</p>
<p>Has also been on the screen. Wang Yuan and Jiang Xiaoxiao starred in "Going to Shanghai." Liu Chunshan, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Bao Lele, Sheng Daidai, Lu Qiqi, Lu Xixi, and Ding Fengying co-starred in "Chicken and Duck Couple." Zhang Yier, Zhou Kongkong, etc. have also shown their comedic talents on the screen. Qin Haha, who used to enjoy the reputation of Northern Comedy, changed his name to Qin Tong and became active in the film industry.</p>
<p>Bengbeng Opera</p>
<p>There was Zi Yushuang's "Begonia Red" on the screen; Yue Opera had Juexian and Tang Xueqing's "Song Stage Amorous History." The use of storytelling in film started with Jin Xing's "Fig" not long ago, with the interspersing of the opening "Mulan Ci," "Burying Jade," and "Remembering the Lyrics" as the first shot. Yue Opera has not yet been on the screen. As for the films that bring together Peking Opera, singing, dancing, and comedy, there was also a variety show film "Entertainment Conference."</p>

<h3>Symphony of Drama and Film</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Now that realistic films are gaining popularity, it should be an opportunity for domestic films to get back on track. Unfortunately, there are no good original scripts, so they still tend towards low-level tastes. It is said that Guohua is planning to film "Black Cat" and "Phantom of the Old House," but judging from the titles, it is clear that the content will lean towards feudalism and superstition. We are not against making such films, but at least, the scriptwriters should inject a sense of justice that matches the times, so as not to fail the educational mission of film.</p>
<p>Although Cantonese films can be welcomed by Cantonese people in Shanghai, in principle, they still undermine the unification of the national language. Recently, after "Prince of Thieves," they will release "Empress Fengliu" starring Chen Yunshang. We hope that this will be "the last time."</p>
<p>The China Travel Drama Troupe, facing a shortage of scripts and feeling that historical dramas and Western dramas are also difficult to win over audiences, is preparing to send people to Hong Kong to find some new original scripts, because our country's famous playwrights such as Song Zhidi, Chen Baichen, You Jing, etc., are all in Hong Kong now!</p>
<p>Following "The Merry Widow," Li Qinian will simultaneously star in "Modern Youth" and "Thief Beauty." "Modern Youth" is written and directed by Ma Xuwibang, and "Thief Beauty" is still written by Ye Yifang, directed by Li Pingqian, and performed by the original cast.</p>

<p>(7) Gao Qingkui</p>
<p>Gao Qingkui is the son of the old actor Gao Sibao (Shijie) and the younger brother of the famous qin player Gao Liankui. He specializes in Lao Sheng (old male) roles. In the years of the Republic of China 7-8 [1918-1919], after Tan and Liu passed away one after another, and Shu Yan did not perform regularly, and Lian Liang was not yet famous, Gao was the most popular Lao Sheng talent. He was naturally gifted with a singing voice and a high pitch, and his voice was clear and melodious. His specialties were "The Empty City Stratagem," "Zhuliang Village," and "Xiaoyaojin." Plays such as "Lord Xinling Stealing the Talisman to Rescue Zhao," "Zheng Zhuanggong Digging the Ground to Meet His Mother," "Crying at the Qin Court," and "Presenting a Silk Robe" are unique masterpieces of Qingkui. He came to the south several times, returning with fame and honor, and enjoyed great prestige on the stage for nearly twenty years. Years ago, he suddenly suffered from a failing voice, and he has not recovered to this day. Unable to perform on stage, he went to Liancheng Society to teach and explain plays to students of the five subjects. He has one daughter, married to Li Shengzao, and four sons. The eldest did not enter the Pear Garden, the second son Shenglin specializes in Wu Sheng (male martial roles), the third son Shitai studies Xiao Chou (clown roles), and the fourth son Shishou also specializes in Wu Sheng (who is Shengling's assistant). All are graduates of the Fu Liancheng class.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Precious Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Gongsun’s Sword Qi Eliminates the First</p>
<p>Wang Yongtai smiled and said, "That's right, of course it's not a coincidence. Nephew, you are here cleaning up this pair of adulterers, but you don't know that my family's affairs tonight are very big and very many? Don't say you don't understand, I was also confused at first. Nephew, if you want to return the jade intact, why not come downstairs with me to meet someone, I wonder if you know him?" Xu Jing was even more confused by Wang Yongtai's words, and guessed that the process must be confusing and extraordinary. He might as well follow him to see who that person is, maybe it's the person who stole my Crimson Wind Sword. That person's skills are small, and it's good for me to get to know him. So he nodded and said, "Little nephew is eager to get back the sword, and is willing to go with Uncle to see that person. Wang Yongtai then said to the two people lying across the floor: "Let you live for a while, and see me come back to clean you up carefully." So he led Xu Jing downstairs. I saw that the lights were bright everywhere downstairs, and the family members were all up. Xu Jing followed Wang Yongtai to the study and saw a person sitting vaguely in the room, turning his back. Xu Jing felt a little suspicious when he looked at it, and when he stepped into the study, the person turned his face back. Xu Jing almost suspected it was a dream, and for a moment he was completely clueless, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Why is my brother also here? It's hard for my brother to understand." It turned out that the person sitting in the room was Liu Yinyang, the sworn brother in Weifeng Mountain. Wasn't this completely beyond Xu Jing's expectation? Liu Yinyang had also stood up and said with a smile, "Jing Ge, you have worked hard! Little brother respectfully returns the sword you lost." After saying this, he took the Scarlet Phoenix Sword from the chair beside him and offered it with both hands. Xu Jing took the sword, looked at it, and it was indeed his own sword, and he inserted it into the scabbard. He woke up in his heart, and thanked Liu Yinying, saying, "Thank you, brother, for returning the lost property, but I don't know if this sword was taken by brother, and deliberately teasing me? Also, I came here, and I didn't explain to my brother in advance, and I hope you will understand my little difficulties. And how did brother arrive here at the same time? And why did you meet my uncle first? Brother, can you tell me the details?" Wang Yongtai said with a smile, "I don't understand this matter very well, Nephew, you can sit down and talk with Liu Jun, and I will listen carefully. (80)</p>
