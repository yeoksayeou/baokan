<p>社評</p>
<h3>遠東的非常時期</h3>
<p>太平洋波濤洶湧，遠東大局現出了空前的緊張。縱然歐陸大戰仍在繼續大規模進行，其重要意義並不容有所貶損，但是整個國際的重心無疑是落在遠東方面。把東方事件附隷到歐戰之下的觀念已經陳舊了，至少就目前而論，足以牽動世界最大部分的事件不是蘇德戰事的局部進退，而是太平洋上若隱若顯但却不斷在發展着的危機。在十年以前是遠東的星星烽火開始破壞了全世界的安寗與秩序，則時至今日，以言撥亂反正和正本淸源，也正應該先在遠東做澈底的淸算。</p>
<p>最近兩旬當中，遠東方面所發生的事態，其重大性幾乎可以和過去十年間這一方面所發生事變的總和相比擬。三國同盟在遠東確已有不被嚴格遵守的跡象，但却不是轉而接近民治國家。而是更要無所依傍和拘束，取得行動的最大自由並以絕對自利的無限制擴展爲最後目標。此其見於實際設施者，對內則爲加緊動員物資，完成高度國防體系，對外則爲南進北進兼籌並顧，同時也並不忽視對中國的戰爭。越南全部根據地的淪胥，印支半島均勢的打破，以至泰國之陷於孤立無告以致不能不依附强禦俾求瓦全，這是東南亞洲半世紀以來向所未有的重大變動；而東北亞洲，又見大軍雲集，加緊部署，新的戰事只是一觸即發、其現實的危險性也許比較南洋方面更大。其南進北進之何去何從，固然不是任何人所能臆測，而且也許還要期待着有利時機的屆臨纔能決定，但是一般看來，其在印支半島的措置也許只是留備他日之需，東北方面的調度却孕育着一個斷然的步驟。關於南洋各屬和東海繽省關切的輕重，固不免因人而異，但在中美英蘇反侵略陣綫已屆完成的此際，海參崴的得失正與新加坡具有同等重大的意義。也同樣爲反侵略陣綫所不能忽視。而且新加坡雖然是不落要塞，以言西太平洋的攻勢戰略却不如海參崴的價值更大，這也許就是最近東北方面形勢比較南洋更爲緊張的原因。</p>
<p>在民治國家以至蘇聯，誠然都不樂見遠東戰事之擴大爆發，以免分散其注視歐局的視綫，以是英美的經濟制裁乃頗具伸縮餘地，蘇聯雖在蘇德不侵協定吃了一次虧，却依然希望中立協定不至蹈其覆轍。而在對方，在凌厲恣睢之中，也未嘗不審愼將事，關於凍結資金的報復，固然明白表示將隨美方態度爲轉移，禁油終於實施之後，也並未實踐其前此關於禁油所發的恫嚇，到反而表示願採較和緩之政策並中止進一步的侵略，只求美國承認其在東亞的盟主地位。這條件固然不是美國所能接受，但却未必不是爲了討價還價而放出的烟慕。小倉的撰文，若杉的返日，都可以看出此一嘗試進行的積極。但是對於這些情事，與其認爲遠束反侵略運動前途的暗礁、無寗視同達到最後節段前一剎那的猶豫，因爲侵略行動往往能發而不能收，懸崖勒馬也只能期之於大智大勇。假如遠東危機還有挽回的可能，則已往十年間曾有過無數的機會，無論所遭遇的是</p>

<p>退讓，是抵抗。是優容，是譴責，乃迄無以變更其一貫的擴展企圖，更何况今日？這些情事，並世各大政治家不會不籌之已熟，因之世人也就不必過分焦慮保衛民治的領導人物竟會墮入綏靖政策的惡道。主動固須爭取。漏洞尤須杜塞。但整個的趨勢却不容懷疑；在侵略者逐步進迫之下</p>
<p>連日據傳英相邱吉爾正偕美國援英專員霍浦金與美總統羅斯福會晤於某地，此說而果屬實，可信其所商談者必以有關太平的問題為主要中心；因為關於歐局的重大事件，只有援蘇和反攻二者，但後者既非一蹴可，關者亦無待於兩國最高當局的研討，只有關於遠東方面的應付雙方更有切實交換意見的必要。英國在已往雖曾是遠東綏靖政策的主動者，但目前遠東方面的發展則已嚴重威脅到英帝國的安全，在南進的途徑上，馬來星島固然首當其衝，北進而進攻蘇聯亦復間接影響到英國對納粹的決戰。無論緩和美方壓力的企圖如何進行，英方斷不能不力求此等威脅之澈底解除，因之亦復不難想像此一談話必然產生具體有效的結果。</p>
<p>遠東的太時代自從四年以前開始以來，到現在已經是吾極泰來，接近了最後淸算的階段了！此後也許還要經過一個艱辛的苦鬥，但最終却必然是光明的到來！</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（七）（三）　大西洋護航親歷記</h3>
<p>這篇是美國名記者雷諾治Quentin　Reynolds，附乘護航隊的貨船，自加拿大至英航程中親歷情况，茲譯錄如下:</p>
<p>船上巳裝了三天的貨，巨大的絞盤，軋軋之聲，不絕於耳，現在貨艙中差不多已經裝滿了。這是一艘萬噸貨船，可是我們在船上所裝的貨巳達一萬七千噸。各種物品，幾於無一不備。內有掩蔽的拽引機，四架飛機，若干噸農具，和數百簍食物。</p>
<p>甲板上的工作，暫爲鬆懈了一會，絞盤和吊車便又忙起來了。一個大簍子正在小心的吊上去，轉眼便放到了貨艙中。又一簍跟着吊將下去，看他們小心翼翼的樣子，使人想到這裏面大概是裝滿着雞蛋。實則簍子裏所裝的比雞蛋還要寳貴。牠們裝滿着各種猛烈的炸藥，一簍又一簍地吊上船去。</p>
<p>船副笑着說，「總共五百噸，一批很好的貨色。」</p>
<p>我們的船是開往英國的護航隊中的一艘，也就是以軍火食物接濟英國生命綫的一部份。我們的船，停在碼頭上裝貨已有三天了。我們再要在港內停泊兩天，等候別的船只齊集裝貨。</p>
<p>我們終於開航了。各船從港內魚貫而出，連綿不斷，眞是一個空前的大集合。裹面有懸着希臘和挪威旗的小貨船，也有懸掛荷蘭旗的，有懸掛丹麥旗的，甚至有懸掛瑞典旗的。現在列成單行，我們這一艘船位居第二，大概是按着牠的大小排列的。後面跟着的船有數英里長。我們一至港外，各船便要列成扇形或牛行綫前進。從今以後，祇有船主知道如何進行。一小時內，領港便要離船了，他允許把我這篇報告送交加拿大檢查員轉交Collier's雜誌。關於護航隊的情形，有多少可以發表，那就非我所知了。</p>
<p>我們所乘的船是藍烟囪輪船公司的塔爾巴號，載重一萬噸。她會在遠東航行多年。她仍保留着原有的太平洋航員，不下百人，其中七十八名是中國人。</p>
<p>船上的乘客祇有四人：一是丹麥籍技術顧間裴蘭生，一是英國工程師甘特爾，一是英國糧食部官員霍勃生，一就是我。船上祇有兩個客艙，所以我們祇好兩人合住一艙。和我同居的是裴蘭生。這却巧得很，他喜歡早睡早起，我則晏眠晏起。這間艙雖祇有八英尺長，六英尺闊，而我們各行共是，彼此不相侵犯。</p>
<p>我們所乘的船，這時向着英國緩緩前進。她的甲板高出水面祇有十英尺，那一萬七千噸的貨物已把她壓得不能再浮起了。除了護送的軍艦不算，我們在護航隊中或者是一艘最快的船，可是我們必須按着行駛最慢的船加只調節速度。</p>
<p>我們也像所有的貨船一樣，船上各置武裝。我們有砲五尊，兩個水手管理着船尾的四英寸射擊潛艇砲，四個陸軍士兵，由一個伍長頻率，管理着四尊高射砲</p>
<p>水手對於潛艇的威脅，莫不嗤之以鼻，雖然他們對於轟炸機却不敢非笑。飛機確然成爲問題，可是被擊中的機會却很少。勞合公司可以代爲保險，所收保費，祇有百分之一。你在護航隊中，正像住居倫敦一機的安全—實際反而更要安全些，因爲這裏沒有在燈火管制下被汽車撞倒的危險啊！</p>
<p>水手在這次旅行中，都有額外的戰時薪給。中國水手的平常工資每月的三十美元，在護航隊中却增至每月五十美元。船副在平時薪水之外，每月另加三十五美元。</p>
<p>我們預期這一次航行的需十八日。從今夜起，我們要受燈火管制了。船的左右舷都漆作黑色，艙門口都懸掛淸厚帆布。我們不能在甲板上吸烟。我們都須把救生圈預備在手邊，並且有人建議我們應當和衣而睡。</p>
<p>遙望加拿大，已祇有一條淡黃色錢，數分鐘後，連這淡黃色綫也要看不見了。我們在抵達英國之前，將不再看見除地。我行篋中帶着十八本偵探小說，便把牠嚴格的分配一下，每天看一本。我們有充足的食物，充足的飲料，海上的新鮮空氣，更可以取之不盡，用之不竭，外加着意氣相投的朋友，這十八天的光陰，想來定必容易過去。</p>
<p>現在我們的船巳走得漸漸的慢下來了，我必須把這篇報告交待給領港。這一决當然是很好的旅行。可是這船十五百噸的炸藥，我却願牠是五百噸的馬鈴暑啊。</p>
<p>（上面這一段是從哈立法克斯港郵寄的，以下部份則是護航隊到達倫敦後由海電拍發的。）</p>
<p>水平綫上，川現了一縷微細的靑烟，在浩浩無垠的大西洋中，烟就是船，然而這船同以是友，也可以是敵。大副拿着望遠鏡，仔細望着。那靑烟漸漸變黑，有時海風吹來，水平綫忍上忽下，烟色又淡了。後來我們已可看見那隻船。</p>

<h3>美出版界權威盧斯夫婦　重慶山城訪問記（三）</h3>
<p>在山巔大使館中，大使詹森以及使館全體職員都來歡迎，我們步入屋中，向外望河對岸的重慶。太陽高高在上，天氣很熱，景象顯得非常平靜。看不見什麼人，聽不到什麼聲音。船都繫在岸邊，空氣一點不騷動。大使講着上一次的空襲情形，那邊一部份怎樣的——「看呀，這在山邊的一大方塊空地」——被燒夷彈燒得精光。少校把表拿出來看，向目眩的天空張望，仔細地傾聽。一九三九年的五月三日四日，最難令人忘却的日子——初次的大空襲。至少有五千人死於非命，還有數千人受傷。還有更多的數千人在去年和前年損失生命。但到現在重慶居民知道怎樣對付了。他們只是離開城市，關上店門，藏好細軟，自己躱到防空窑中。到現在死的不至一百人——除非發生了大火，沒有一人會喪生的。</p>
<p>「飛機在那邊來了！」我不能聽到什麼，在眩目的天空也看不到什麼。於是一聲「龍，哄龍，哄龍，哄龍」。足有一哩長的黑烟從山背面昇起。少校向天空指點，我看見的耀在日光下的銀色飛機。是六架，十二架，不錯，有不少不少飛機。「哄龍——哄龍」的聲音在一分鐘後消滅——這黑烟，和着塵埃的黑烟升到天，散佈開來，於是變得寂靜了。我們等着，拍了幾張照片，提出幾個問題，聽他們講在三年轟炸歷史中的種種故事。</p>
<p>我們回到城中，最要緊知道的是受損者有多少。我們在大路上看到一所小屋或商店處處都是破損，人們在亂磚堆中忙着揀視，把磚塊砌成一堆，搶救受損的傢具。全街上又是往返不絕，比前更其繁忙。防空隊在三小時前我們見到出發工作，現在經過擁擠的街道，開步回來。我們走到一處美美教會的空地，就在這大礦塲的中央，被炸彈炸成一個大穴，周圍五十碼之處是一堆一堆新翻起的砂土。</p>
<p>寇爾爵士眞如人人知道的一般，不但是在中國最風趣的外人，而且據許多人的意見，也是一位最能幹的外交家。寇爾爲蘇格蘭貴族，服膺自由主義。他的住宅像供飲茶用的凉亭。此屋造了本爲供蔣委員長之用，但後來即租與寇爾爵士，租金移充撫養戰士遺孤之用。爵士指給我看在他住宅周圍爲炸彈所損之處，那裏有石灰掉下來。接着我們坐下來談了兩小時關於中國的政情。</p>
<p>是夜，我們同外交部畏同餐，王外長爲一著名學老，曾出席海牙法庭，現正要自外交部退休。這晚上出席的人物還有會講故事的靑年重慶市長及其夫人。市長太太可稱標準中國美人，小巧玲瓏，她的面容是光潤的鵝蛋臉。一張櫻桃小口會講聰明精巧的話。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>轟炸明天仍有。大的在九時半，威德同我們在一起整理電文，僕人跑來靜靜的說：「第一個球。」日機剛離開漢口。僕人忙着把各種束西包紥好，我們即凖備赴本市另一端，中央銀行所設的防空洞中。自路上至銀行以及銀行後面的防空洞間，有一長段石級。在右級上約有三四十人集合在那裏——要有了派司才可進入此特別的防空洞。有一很漂亮的美國人坐在較下面的石級上，穿了一條灰色短褲，此人名威廉韓德（William　Hunt），是在中國推銷各種美國出品的權威代表。</p>
<p>太陽漸漸昇高，最後，二决緊急警報巳響，我們都離開石級，在甬道中經過幾個衛兵的看守，跑入地下室。我們所抵達的一間是很大的地下室，雖然擁擠，但尚稱舒適。銀行職員和他們的家屬都避在這。其中一部份眞留給我們及韓德公司的。閑談的有半小時，猜賭最近的炸彈將落在何處…於是突然問全洞中變得寂靜，當然，有尖銳聽覺的可以辨別日機的轟炸聲。蓬—潑拉拉—蓬—潑拉拉。這種可怕的聲浪的有半分鐘，於是一切都歸消滅，再隔半小時，我們已跑出來重見天日。</p>
<p>我們自防空洞的石級跑出來，走到大路上時，恰好遇見吳市長出來查察所受的損害。他僅停了一會，打一個招呼就跑。這天我們有一偉大的的會—和蔣夫人，也許委員長亦在內茶叙。蔣夫人在人類中具有激動的偭性，不是任何富於魔力的關於她的描寫所能述其萬一。蔣夫人走進她的寬大，光綫暗淡的會客室時，她就以百分之一百流利的英語和我談話；講話的快，爲我從未聽到別人這樣講過。談話中間，一扇門開了，一個人在沒有覺察中跑進室內。過了一會談話仍舊繼續下去。於是你突然覺得室內除了剛剛靜靜地跑進來的人以外，好像沒有別人。我們都站了起來。一個細長的凜然不可侵犯的人物穿了灰色衣服走近前來，可以聽到數聲淸晰的歡迎：「好…好…。」蔣夫人爲我們介紹了。語聲中現在帶着喜悅和好客的神態，在薄的嘴喪邊顯出一絲笑意：「好……好……好……」他走過去站在他的椅子前。「好…好…」他招呼我們坐下。</p>
<p>他問起我們的旅程，對於我們特來訪問，表示感謝，我們作簡短的答詞，蔣夫人把對於他有興趣的事情解釋給他聽。聚餐了—精緻而簡單的食物，正是我在中國最歡喜吃的食物。我給他看一册照相簿，其中有他和蔣夫人的照片，還有不少是政府中其他重要官員。他看了自己和蔣夫人的照片快樂和孩子一般。他把每張照片看得很快，但如是政府中不甚重要的官員，他就略去不看。…一小時後，我們知道巳熟識了兩個人，一個男人，一個女人，此二人在現在活着的數百萬人羣中，在無數世紀後仍將給人們記憶着。</p>
<p>在重慶三日，覺得要在最短期間到前綫去一趟是不可能的。我由翻譯者董顯光君轉達，告訴委員長想要看看他的軍隊。半小時中我只覺得他的目光灼灼逼人。現在他聽到這要求後，表示首肯。於是他停了一會，我想他正在估計安置中國每一架飛機的地點吧。我們步出這所屋子時，良善的董君面孔上充滿芯驚疑的神色。</p>

<h3>金融　華商意興濃厚　進美匯六十萬元</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙滙掛牌各滙未更、英美滙暗市續緊甚銳、乃華商投機家仍不斷力扒、英美商行本在供意轉　之際，更有義泰興煤結款、滙豐對於五元一二五僅祇一千美元供給、小櫃檯改縮至五元〇六二五、華商扒興更有增無减、英金雖有港電來吐出、而有利及華行納意均佳、致兩滙同時步緊迄午收、半日交易頗旺、華商投機家軋扒美金達五六十萬元、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>更有煤斤結款</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市大條復長、美印平、各國滙兌英對滬獨縮〇三一二五、餘平、中央掛牌各滙勿更、內盤晨開（路照透電）英滙三辦士〇七八一二五、美華商投機家來扒進八九月美金少數價五元一五六二五、後僅五元一二五、勢巳回軟、滙豐掛牌未更、白銀平衡稅升二五、計微百分之二四·五〇、聞港電來吐出八月期英滙三辦士〇九三七五、由有利及華行吸進後、聞有煤結款、滙豐供售八月價五元一二五爲數極小、投機家力扒僅五元〇九三七五、午刻市勢頗緊八月英金港電塞三辦士〇六二五、故午收現貨至九月期向結英金僅三辦士〇四六八七五、美金五元〇九三七五、比上日收市美緊〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>翻多傾進　金市向榮</h3>
<p>昨烚赤暗市升騰益銳價再飛出六千八百元大關外、各方人心一致向榮、全因外滙再處於投機扒風中趨緊、滬西幫翻多傾進、金號幫證券號爭進亦烈、價由六千七百五十八元步見盤上、午刻漲勢擴大、升達六千八百二十元、終續猛漲六十元、半日交易六七萬兩、下午週三無市、現金漲勢轉緩、而空前高價層出不窮、證券號售予某銀樓五十兩、價八千五百六十元、成記出費文元三十兩、及天元二十兩爲八千五百七十元新高價、明豐出費文元四十兩、成記出宏慶永三十兩、爲八千五百六十元、再升六十元、飾金亦漲五元、違八百七十五元、</p>
<p>期貨再抬六十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市爲六千七百七十元、比上日收價高十二元、時在買風中因合盛力售、故升至六千七百七十五元、會回退至六千七百五十八元、美金五元一五六二五難結、大豐·公和·同康永·德孚來力進、一哄三十二元、達六千七百九十元、爲新豐永。成記。義元吐出、壓下至六千七百六十元、後趨穩定甚久、直至十一點光景、外滙緊勢加銳、再將買風掀動、恒記。義豐。益大。鼎盛散戶等四起傾進、滬西幫搜羅、價頓步飛上五十五元、哄達六千八百十五元、爲祥興永。立泰傾售、退至六千七百九十元、奈外滙仍緊、不久義元。祥和。合盛。熾大等猛進、一哄三十元、見六千八百十元、爲德孚。大豐售出、抑退至六千八百〇五元、正午收市又抬至六千八百十八元、收後義元續出、退至六千八百十二元、最後抬至六千八百二十元、上半日有六十二元差度、價終續升六元、照八月美金五元〇九三七五結價、為六千八百三十六元八角、計撳十八元八角、下午週三塲外亦無市無價、現金號門市賣價八千六百元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>首飾金兌價日高</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行晨掛八百七十元、十一點升五元、爲八百七十五元、收進减四十元、</p>
<h3>港幣超出五元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、期金雖漲、然現金價尚穩、故英美金鎊亦站穩、英金票回起一元、美余票開盤一千九百四十一元、開後會高至四十七元、嗣忽退爲三十九元、順源聯合協泰永祥源永等趁賤力購、抬至六十元、午收一千九百五十九元、比上日軋升二十一元、現貨十九元五角半、香港票趨勢挺俏、晚市高至五元零五分、坎拿大票趨勢亦挺、日金票及朝鮮票均趨堅漲、前者高至二元二角六分、後者升爲一元七角八分、</p>
<h3>證券　為了債息時間問題　統甲頗有售出</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市先疲後堅、初因多頭出籠而疲、繼以空方抵補而堅、趨勢固屬盤旋、前途演變恐希望甚少、多方漸漸搖動、目下尚有空方抵補交易、以爲柢制、各種公債繼續報堅、獨甲種反走疲象、此因做多者不願看籤而脫手、因甲種之中籤權利雖多、而中籤後所獲之利益亦復有限、蓋需遲至十三個月後始能完全收到、若以中籤後以市價九折售出、而其所得之利益更少、况中籤與吾尚在不可知之數、故頗有人賣出甲種、買進乙種、以爲無可投機中之投機、昨上午新華永昌潤利買進、怡泰鴻大賣出、午收較疲、午後益昌中孚鼎康賣進、新華聯益補進、丙種再穿川八元關、盤旋緒果、除甲種獨跌二角半及丁種未有做開外、其他各種均尚微好一一角至四角、交易漸稀、成交全日祇一百二十萬左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股五十股、價為二十八元二角半，</p>
<p>衆業股市開穩收軟、中途稍有變化、公共汽車股晨初有人爭進、價自十八元六角漲達二十元、嗣又反動回跌元許、</p>
<h3>煤炭　熟煤現貨缺乏</h3>
<p>熟煤生意、近日因焦炭來源不多、銷塲略動、而自來火行鑒於烟煤行情飛俏、成本高昂、出品較少、致市上現貨大見缺乏、各熟煤行已無貨可售、不得不出高價向圍戶搜購老單、以資應市、故高低相差甚巨、約四百六十元至四百八十元之間、本街店家、大多斷檔、停止出售云</p>
<h3>紗花多空各有見地　紗市不上不下</h3>
<p>紗市依然平席、此因實際交易不旺之故、至於香港方面、對於三二支單紗及四十二支辦去之貨、均係供給香港當地之需用、所以交易尚佳、惟二十支紗因內地運輪續處處遭受阻梗、購買絕少進展之象、因之市態呆滯乏勁也、查市塲上之議論、多方謂原料問題、近日標金趨昂、證券幫及金子幫隨之金市而購進、然同業方面、因銷路不暢、存貨充足、而雜脾紗價愈廉、二十支天女僅售一千四百十元、二十支雙地球售一千三百八十五元、至九十元、如斯比較、雙馬獨昂、且廠方頗有開售模樣、所以逢高時而傾向拋賣、多空兩方爭持尤烈、市面益呈欲漲無力、欲跌不能之局面也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千五百八十二元，低價爲一千五百六十六元、午後市况異常渙散成交寥寥、初做一千五百七十二元、跌至七十元、最後個爲一千五百七十四元、</p>
<p>雙馬農開、多方心意雖昂、然塲中氣象平常、叫高大家要出、首盤價爲一千五百一七十七元、少頃漲至一千五百八十二元、旋開二十支紗客方銷路欠佳、又鬆落至一千五百六十五元、未幾以標金上升、證券幫有一部份復來拉提、漲至一千五百八十二元、然同業中套責者極盛、迨至收盤、又復回挫至一千五百七十四元、查半日間成交統計六千一百九十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行六、〇〇〇　香港一九〇統計六、一九〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、因美棉續趨下游、金號曁證券商多頭均了結、除九月期微升半元外、八月期跌三元、九月跌三元半、開後聞雙馬廠單紗尚緊、益以金價續向上、斯時新買與補空復殷、八月期高至一千四百五十九元、九月期一千五百三十四元、十月期一千五百四十二元、入後以客銷終欠發展、多頭逢高轉賣、八月朝又小至一千四百五十一元、九月期一千五百二十一元、十月期一千五百三十三元、最後稍回、午後八月期平定、九月跌二元半、十月跌四元半、成交七千　百包、後　交易淸淡、價則俱鬆、各降一至四元、晚收結果、八月期比上日跌四元、九月期跌三元半、十月期跌六元、全日共成交九千五百九十包、比上日减少八干四百十包、再將全日開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>棉花廠需不起</h3>
<p>棉紗情况、益呈昂中帶軟、大衆以廠需久寂、價格又無絲毫鬆動、成交大减、加以海外棉市、亦在徬徨之境、至於本棉、一般棉商心中一致看升、事實如斯、然消費鑒於棉紗出路之悲觀、予棉商成一反比例、所以欲求十分興奮、亦難得也、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠洋行外棉定貨交易、市况因美印棉趨跌而見弱、同時更因國際情勢混沌、太平洋危機四伏、而購意减低、連日僅將近抵滬之現貨交易、聊覺踴躍外、各廠方之直接從海外定成者、均有審愼從事之　也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因華盛頓政治消息不利多頭、及紐奧倫斯軟弱而跌、昨日因財政部大臣曾彈劾扶助棉農之斯密司議案、同時政府貸棉宣示須較目下况降低二分之影饗、人心不惶恐、但續後又因一部分空頭抵補略漲、結果收盤價格、較上　　跌二十三至二十八磅因不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進而漲、但續後又因多頭獲利了給、及氣候報告不利多頭而略跌、昨日收盤價格各漲二至七羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市况看跌四至四羅比半、</p>
<h3>疋頭　漂染布斜紋　南洋出口湧旺</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢續堅、乃因港幫南洋幫出口湧旺、人心聯機、細紗貨印花貨以原料及整理費增貴關係、上漲較多、白貨漲勢稍弱、綸昌克羅綢由最近四十七元增至四十九元、土林布綫呢啤嘰每疋漲一元左右、白貨富貴細布細斜平定、雜牌因染廠需要較切每疋漲二角半至五角、本街成交各布一千餘件、粵港南洋幫進漂染布斜紋五干五百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　形勢續昂、惟售盤略有參差、取引所各月期貨每疋回跌一角五分左右、現貨龍頭細布廠單亦跟挫一角、下午收盤爲五十二元六角半、但中下擋雜牌細布與細斜則一致報漲、蓋以本街染銷需要不絕、手貨根子漸緊、每疋續升三五角不等、色貨四君子嗶嘰交易轉淸、價頗平定、新單新稅晚收爲一元七角三分，新單老稅一元六角六分半、統扯均回落一分、呢羬銷路、　來續形减少、客幫因打搬運證困難、兼運輸阻滯，絕少暢辦、本街因實銷落令、添進均懈、秋冬貨初有納胃、後受英美匯凍結、價格疾升、回戶幫亦受上週漲風起後、悉皆止進、致邇日零躉交易微細、而大路貨行情沽價、則並不因銷滯而有變動、市面空氣始終挺漲、握貨者居奇特甚、呢羬各貨、無一不偕、寅豐一四七〇法西襯、昨每碼批售一元六角、黑炭襯四元二角半、文素臣蔴膠布二元五角、仁泰人猿泰山雨衣綢六元五角、抱別林六元、裏子呢二元五角、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價重振</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况又在盤旋狀態中遂步回振、早市挺秀、中市回疲、午市又以買濃上漲、結果期現兩貨均比前市漲起一二元，綠早市以謠言利於買方、市面尚見穩站、旋因新粳絡繹抵埠、且內地新早尖均經見樣、至蕪湖一帶及江北新尖均有十足收成、內地長江各埠採辦洋米者均已停辦、而新尖亦不久可以湧到、因此人心立隨市價下遊、繼因大戶客囤趁平吸收、而滬西需要更貪、繼因種種謠諑無不爲買方張目、市乃逐步上砌、小絞英華司自一百四十七元至一百四十七元半、二號暹邃米自一百三十七元半至一百三十八元八角、現小紋亦自一百十七八元大至一百二十元、比之前市均較大元外至二元許不等、成交二萬包、叉六百噸、計現貨收盤一號西貢開百三十一元、百三十元、中關百二十九元、二號百二十二元、百二十元、二號暹還白十九元半、百十九元、高百二十二元、敏黨百三十元、中决百二十四元至百二十一元、尚佛米百二十七八元、荷蘭白粳百三十一二元、銀行樣小絞白十九元半、外棧百十八元半、東京　尖百十二元八角、百十一元半、碎尖九十二元决至八十九元九角、總之先後一疲一緊、轉輾變化、較之前市收價猶增元許、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市、續以來源轉旺、人心不振、本街及鄕莊店銷均懈、形成供求不勻、市面繼落元砠、開南港早晚稻百四十九元、百四十七元、無錫原包白梗白四十四元、至於糯米亦以去路徵細、致雖貨稀尚難立足、續貶折元、開香港白元高自百二十四元半、次至宿黃百十八五、糯茶百十三元至百十元左右、獨國糯以內地存底將罄、來源久已告斷、有限市貨不肯輕脫、猶屬小平、仍售百二十六元、</p>
<h3>粉價略緊</h3>
<p>昨粉市初緊後鬆、結果稍有回好、女易活動者仍以金龍粉爲最、初爲三十一元七角、旋至六角半六角、其昌棧貨三十一元四角半、砲台粉三十三元、統共成交萬包左右、其餘如花魚及鐘樓粉太古及羅斯福棧貨（不過磅）的三十三元、銀行棧貨過磅三十四元三四角之譜、市勢盤旋、無甚榮辱、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆與苞米　囤戶出籠價回小</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆走銷較前稍遜、一部囤記趁高漸有川籠、故市勢業見轉疲、行情比上日降落兀許、統市由港幫辦去膠州黄豆六百包、價為五十一元半至五十一元、本街問津靑口黃豆二百包、價五十元零五角至五十元、歸德次黃豆三百包、價四十八元半、</p>
<p>苞米囤戶頗有陸續吐售、僅日商梢有辦胃、故重勢欲振乏力、而呈疲軟之象、昨售開西貢及荷蘭苞米二千包、價見降半元至元許、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤白糖俱升</h3>
<p>昨糖市以國際局勢流言利多、續見上展、公司期貸二四粗白、八月十日交割者初爲一百零二元半、中途小至一元九角、後升至二元八角、升五角、八月二十日一百零二元八爭至三元八角、升角半、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白七月份到貨一百零三元半至四元一角、升六角、六月份一百零二元半、至三元七角、升七角、五月份一百零一元八角至三元半、升一元、四月份一百零二三元、三月份一百零二元二角至二元八角、升度近元，荷赤NT嘜八十六元半至八十七元、升二元二角、太古車白B嘜一百三十元、不動、HX嘜一百零七元半至八元、本廠一號冰一百三十五元、晶明冰一百三十七元、</p>
<h3>海味　甬子淡獻新</h3>
<p>眞波海味、如海蜇陳貨極緊、新貨則見回降、蜇皮新貨九十元、陳貨一百四十元、蜇頭新貨七十元、陳貨一百三十元、</p>
<p>螟蜅鮝又見上升、舟山貨爲四百三十元、寗波貨二百七十元、其他如烟台貨爲三百六十元，</p>
<p>寗波子淡初决獻新、首盤開至六百五十元、陳貨早經告乏無市、</p>
<h3>南北貨　淮北菜昨有到</h3>
<p>淮北菜昨正式到有一批、計八十一包、尚未轉棧、大的今日可開、徐州菜零星有到、行盤再升四五元、因現貨軋缺所致、</p>
<h3>木耳回升</h3>
<p>木耳近以到貨較稀、而去化稍活、價乃回好二三十元、河口耳開過七百五十二元行盤、航空郵耳升至七百八十元、普通七百三二四十元至七百二十元、</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵　輕易不具拋開</h3>
<p>十四號與二十六號大馬口鐵交易、前昨由本街鎖廠機器廠以及紗廠幫稍起搜索、同業人心仍告堅昂、查昨市標準行情如二十四號貨、每箱沽一千五百元、二十六號花色則每箱開一千二百五十元、較之前市、又各漲起達七八十元至一百元不等、查是貨久稀到來、市存十分單薄、故同業心思更堅、即五箱十箱之躉批交易、大有不肯輕易拋開之勢、</p>

<p>防杜流弊操之中國</p>
<p>經濟家言、美政府此番實施凍結日本資金、政治意義、實重於經濟意義、良以美政府在太平洋上、在未採取斷然處置前、如遽爾雷厲風行、事勢亦有未便、且上海情形複雜、環境特殊、外商在滬擁有絕大權益、現時美政府雅小願作不必要之犧牲、抑有　者、中國財政當局已一再聲明、維持上海黑山、美政府此次凍結中　資金、旣係循中政府之請、則對上海外滙山塲之合法申請、自當由各指定銀行、儘可能供給、因此致使本市投機家、利用某一進出口洋行或公司名義、以活動扒塞外匯者、因早為意料中事、惟中國政府當局可視情形需要、隨時與美政府保持觸、規定特殊辦法、頒佈施行、以杜絕此種不合法之外匯買賣、</p>

<p>公共車輪售票員收車資而不給票之惡習、由來已久、各方對此、頗金現難公司方面不設法除此惡習、或改善售票員之待遇者、然亦有一部份乘容、具謬誤之心理、對售票員此種惡習不予計較、實則如諺所云」羊毛出在羊身上」公司方面收入如不足其預算之數、唯有加價以補足之、直接受捐失者、仍為乘客、明此、可知對售票員惡習不予計較、必蒙直接損失、且間接助長不道德行為、至認售票員之下當工資、若確不敷開支支、自可向公司方面提出合理要求、必可獲社會人士之聲援也、</p>
<p>售票待遇並不菲薄</p>
<p>本報頃接英商上海電車公司來函、內稱、該公司對與情深加關注、並願聲明該公司已盡力消除售票員惡習、而售票員之工資、不可謂菲薄、且規定售票員之行為優良者年終特發發津貼、以資鼓勵、該公司逐日値班之售票員共八百七十九人、華·英俄·韓人查票員共一百七十一人、隨時登車查票、平均每五售票員鄧為查票員一人、</p>

<h3>虹口若干猶太人　將遭日方驅逐　已從事調查所謂「不良份子」　至如何安頓則尙未加以考量</h3>
<p>字林報云、日海軍發言人昨日（五日）招待新聞記者時聲稱、日當局刻正鄭重研究、擬將日方控制區內之猶太難民逐出若干成、研究結果、若干不良猶人、或將被逐、何時實行、則尚未確知、</p>
<p>所謂穩定虹口安寗　日當局此舉之內在動機、與穩定蘇州河北岸猶人之生活有關、緣有許多猶人泰半爲不良份子、似未備必要之許可證、混入虹口、致影嚮猶人區之房租與食物價格、日當局恐虹口之安寗、因此受擾、故擬逐川一切不良份子、藉謀一般猶太難民之福利、而不良份子之驅逐、將由猶太僑民協會爲之、且不致採取强迫手段、</p>
<p>一般猶人大為震驚　或問不良猶人被逐出浜北後、將往何處棲身、發言人答稱、當局對此、尚未加以考量、關於此事、上海「遠東商業電聞報」編輯猶人桑摩氏巳向日當局提出書面抗議、加以反對、據桑摩談稱、日方將逐出虹口與匯山兩區「不良」猶太難民之訊、使猶人大爲震驚、</p>
<p>日方積極　從事調查　上海猶太紀事報一曾載一訊、預示日方將有此舉、據該訊所傳、日海軍陸戰隊已邀若干猶人、如該報編輯萊文等、組成小組委員會、會同日陸戰隊剔除「不良份子」、該小組委員會除向日方報告若干猶太難民是否善良外，並將於調查完畢後、立即逐出未備許可證而寄居虹口之猶人、</p>
<p>片面行為殊屬非法　桑摩氏續稱、渠可代表虹口區一萬一三千猶太難民聲明、彼應日方之請而組小組委員會者、並無代表虹口全體猶人之資格、且多數並非寓居虹口、亦未商諸其他猶人領袖、再者、日方擬取之舉動、實屬非法行爲、以其旣未商諸工部局、（虹口乃公共租界之一部份）亦未向上海猶人推出之任何團體商榷也、渠覺此種片面舉動、如果實行、將使上海情勢、更趨緊張</p>
<p>約四千人無許可證　又英文大美晚報云、關於日海軍發言人所稱擬逐出虹口未登記之不良猶人一節、工部局與猶太難民委員會現候日當局採取正式步驟、故不能有所對付行動、衆信現居虹口而未備日方許可證之猶人、共約四千人、但其中頗多在日方採行許可證制之前即已抵滬者、且多數無法在本市他處覓容身處、故日當局若果逐川此輩猶人、徒使本市增加困難、</p>
<h3>颶風季屆臨</h3>

<h3>美撤僑政策仍舊　但局勢無變動　有重要任務者仍可留居　赫爾國務卿之明白表示</h3>
<p>據前日（五日）消息所傳、美國務卿赫爾頃謂美政府於長久以前、即已　促遠東美僑乘船舶通行時撤退回國、上海美僑接此消息、不無詫慮、因國務卿此言似表示撤僑政策已有變更也、英文大美晚報接美僑　話叩詢此事者、絡繹不斷、乃於昨夜致電刻在美國之編輯高爾德、探問一切、</p>
<p>全體撤退並無此意</p>
<p>頃接覆電、乃悉撤僑政策、仍僅適用於「非必要」美僑、高氏覆電稱、渠與國務院要員通電話、承其告曰、「去歲十月宣布而至二月問加以重申之美國撤僑政策、毫無變更、最近遠東雖有種種發展、然華盛頓方面證實基本地位、仍無變動、故撤僑通告照舊、仍僅適用於非必要美僑、而擔當必要任務之美　、仍可寄居遠柬、赫爾昨發非正式之言論、其意僅在追逃前發之撤僑通告、而非修改或擴大之云、按高爾德於五月間返美後、會與國務院官員屢决長談、乃根據其所獲淸報撰文寄來、略謂、美政府並無囑促遠東美僑全體撤退之意、僅欲婦孺及認爲不必留居遠東之男子撤返美國而已、美政府極願「保持國旗飄揚」云、</p>
<p>在日美僑即將返國　又據美官方消息、美政府現擬派遣輪船隻赴日、接載留滯日本之美僑六百五十四名、撤退返國、此等僑民、因日本停止赴美船運、不能返國、至於留居上海之美僑、原數在四五千左右、自去秋絡繹撤退以還、巳有半數以十相率返國、在船隻方面、撤退之僑民有一大部份係乘美政府特派之三輪返國、以後即陸續搭乘美國郵船公司太平洋綫各輪離離滬、美政府曾一度有再派專輪來遠東載僑撤退之意嚮、唯因普通航運幷未因局勢變化而中斷、且非必要僑民幾已撤退完畢、故實無另行派輪之必要、目前準備繼續撤退者、僅爲一小部份之婦孺而已、</p>

<p>訪問工作，在中請未截止前，即已開始，而日來更加派人員，紛赴各中請人家中實地調查。雖連日火傘高張，揮汗如雨，加以法租界車輛罷工，同人等一往直前，精神百倍，烈日之下，尋找里弄，往返奔波，非特不以爲苦，益感所負使命之重大！</p>

<p>女傭之子</p>
<p>當我第一天開始助學訪問的時候，是在九八。五度的最熱天氣之下，我懷着滿腔的興奮和新寄的情緒，我默默地想，我是向大都市的上海去探險，在生活程度如此高昂之下，將使我發現許多可歌可泣的生活形態，許多優秀的靑年子弟，感覺學費的難於籌措而彷徨悲戚！我的心胸不覺由緊張而發川同情的徵笑。社會所賜予我們的同情，我們將還之於社會。</p>
<p>那天，我的目的地是法租界極偏僻的汶林路，貝當路，徐家滙路這一圈內，依照預定的路錢，第一個被訪問者　汶林路某號，照申請單所塡，只是母子兩人，職業是僕人，收入只四元。我已斷定這門牌是他母親的東家的住宅。那是三層樓高大的弄掌洋房，當我走上第一層石階扶梯，詢問季姓的時候，有一位十四五歲的大孩子，伴着一個六七歲的面目淸秀的小孩子，應聲而川，大孩子告訴我說，他就是我所要訪問者。對於我逐一的發問，他很詳細地把他的生活情形告訴了我。</p>
<p>他是十四歲的男孩子，現在他在住所對面的景鴻小學讀書，暑期後還只是四下年級，這是春季班，原因是中涂輟學過一年。他的母親就在那住戶當「娘姨」，工資只得四元，從前在湄洲路廠家作工，他也就在湄洲路一所小學裏讀書，戰事發生，他的母親失了業，他也因此輟學。後來他母　便幫傭度日，苦心撫育這唯一的兒子。他便跟隨着他的母親在東家幫做雜作，沒有工資，只求得一個膳宿有所，不致漂流無依。原籍崇明，有一間平房，薄田三畝，租給人家，收入極微，母子兩人，巳經七年沒有回鄕了。他預備小學畢業後學生意去。</p>
<p>當我去訪他的時候，是上午十一點鐘光景，他的母親正在樓下爲她的東家做飯，沒有會見。另外那位小東人始終注視着我和這個大孩子的問答，我便問他，你聽我們的說話感覺興趣嗎？他是默默不答。一位中年以上的歸人，大致就是家主母罷，提高了嗓音，質問我什麼事情，我告以我是爲幫助貧苦的孩子讀書而來的。她報以瞥，轉身入房。我窺見臥室裹有沙發，有西式陳飾，相當整潔。（調查員T）</p>
<h3>虹口日海軍警備區　禁止通行</h3>

<h3>捫心自問</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>爲了文藝作品對於讀者人衆影響的重大，一個文藝作家，在　動筆之前，應該先捫心（良心！）自問：我爲甚麼要寫這篇東西？這篇作品對於讀者會發生甚麼影響？我要這篇作品對讀者發生甚麼影響？</p>
<p>為文藝而文藝的作家，把文藝看成消遣品的作家，把文藝作品看做個人創作慾的滿足的作家，也許就不想去管到這些。他們祇想把胸中的故事叙述出來，祇要描寫動人，於願已足。他們沒有遠大的計劃，沒有清楚的目標，他們是為創作而創作的。</p>
<p>然而這是沒有用的，不請他有計劃沒有計書，他的作品總是要對讀者羣發生或好或壞的影響的。這當然與作者的人生觀與世界觀有直接的關係，但是我們暫時不去談到這些。我們祇想指川一點赤裸裸的事實：不論你承認不承認，一篇文藝作品終是要對讀者發生有形的或無形的或好或壞的影響，而這好壞的影響的主權，是掌握在文藝作家的手裹的，是應該由作家本人去負責的。</p>
<p>我們希望每個作家，對於自己已發表的作品，拿出來詳細地檢查一下。對於沒有意義的，麻醉性的，或　毒素的作品，應立即停止發行。對於未來的作品，我們希望每個有良心的文藝作家，都會捫心自問：這篇作品會對讀者發生甚麼影響？我要使這篇作品對讀者發生甚麼影響？</p>

<h3>怎樣消除憤怒？</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>人類是有感情的動物，「喜怒哀樂」便是受外物感觸後的情感表示。缺少修養的人，最容易激起惰感，這對於一個人的身體，實在有莫大的妨害。但是，一個普通人怎樣來修養情感呢？這的確是一個困難的問題。你也許可以從古聖賢的書中找到不少修養的要訣，然而頭緒萬端，從何處着手呢？</p>
<p>「憤怒」的發洩，是情感中最要不得的事；除非最有修養的人，才不易時常動怒。如果有人無端的擊你一下，你會不勃然大怒嗎？姑不論這一下大怒「，對於你身體上有何直接影響，重要的一點是你怎樣使這一下「大怒」消除呢？你或者怒罵那人幾句，或者還盤那人一下，然而你的憤怒倘仍未消除，那麼你將用什麼力　消除它？這該是——分有趣的。</p>
<p>對於「憤怒」研究得最透澈的，當推美國心理學家楊博士（Dr.Ruokin　Young），他專心致志於「憤怒」之心理的研究，垂十七年之久。他認爲憤怒的對於人們影響，害多於利；幸而一切憤怒是可以用方法消除的。憤怒的分類，並不以憤怒的程度而分，也不以憤怒的的原因而分，更不以憤怒的狀態而分，而是以憤怒的時間而分，第一種是「蘊藏憤怒」；例如深刻的仇恨，心中憤然，由來巳久，初未有所表示，後來忍無可忍而勃發。第二種是「即時憤怒；」例如遭受不平，立刻勃然大怒，興以往一切無關。第三種是「事後憤怒」；例如憤怒在當時並不勃發，而遺留下一種似乎一自怨自艾」的情緒。若用數目字表之：1，2，3表示憤怒程度，每一種憤怒用一個數目字表示其階段，則第種是：「1，2，3」，第一種是：「0，0，3，」第三種是：「3，2，1」。此三種不同憤怒，各有不同影響。據楊氏由精密置騐得到結論，在三種憤怒之後，一個人精神上復原所需要的時間，是一，二，三種成二一三之比。至於發怒後對於一種人直接的影響，不妨以舉重力表示之，第一種憤怒可促使一人的舉重力加多二分之一；第二種憤怒可突加一倍以上；第三種憤怒則减少的四分之一，楊氏指川；憤怒時的增多舉重力，不足以爲慶；因爲憤怒對於腦神經的打擊，非常嚴重。楊氏舉例道：一個人在正常憤怒之時，若在一分鐘內辨別不出橘紅，玫瑰紅，深紅三種顏色者，那麼這人的腦部，無異受了八十五磅的一下打擊。若憤怒時覺得一片昏天黑地，不能視，不能聽，則所受打擊更重了！不僅其行狀有如瘋在而己</p>
<p>這時，最重要的便是已經憤怒後，如何消除它？楊氏認爲現代科學昌明，以某種物理機械來淸除憤怒，或者有成功的可能。但在物理機械尚未發明之前，還是利用心理的力量比較有效。在第一種憤怒勃發時，閱讀偉人傳記，著名歷史紀事，或則追憶偉人故事，歷史事蹟等，這樣，對於憤怒的消險有奇特功效，而在第　種憤怒發生後，應迅即離開現在環境，特別注重於另一件事，移注全部精神於共上，或則傾全力於搜索研尋某一對於自己有特別興趣的事物，這可以使愼怒的移去，非常迅近。關於第三種憤怒，昔樂的婉美與圖畫的幽雅，是最有效的良藥，最深的憤怒，也必定可以藉此而消除的。以上種種，是楊氏認爲對於普通人士最有效也最容易做到的方法。至於因各人的環境，個性，思想，教育程度不同，而對消怒的方法大有差異，楊氏對此，會舉出六十七種性格不同的人物，各有其消怒之法，但總而言之，在原則上是根據上述方法，而加以嚴密詳盡試騐後的所得結果。</p>
<p>不錯，人類是有感情的動物，總不免有感情的流露；但要修養到抑止憤怒，不動聲色的地步，的確很不容易。不過，若憤怒己經勃發了，迅即自己消除它，這種「亡羊補牢」的辦法，倒也未嘗不是值得稱許的！</p>

<p>每個人生都該有三個時期　　（一）受教育時期在這一個時期中，他該儘量地利用他的時間與精神來獲得最好的學問。</p>
<p>（二）建立事業時期有了學問之後，他就得往社會中去創立事業了。他應該努力做一個「人」；同時，他該爲他自己與家庭的前途諜取最大的幸福。</p>
<p>（三）服務社會時期　這時期乃是人生中最要緊的一個階段，也就是決定其成敗和偉大與否的時期。他該知道：他所得到的一切金錢財產都是這社會賜予他的，所以他決不可單顧自己的生活的舒適，他該使別人也能過美滿的日子。許多許多人都因忽略了這點而失敗了。他們在前個時期中已經得到了很多的錢財，可是還不知足，還是貪得無厭。他們都忘記怎樣來報答這個從前曾經培植過，幫助過他們的社會了。</p>

<p>「對不起，家裹還有一些兒小事，待……」梅實還想用別的話來向她支吾，免得大家當塲說破了不好思意。</p>
<p>但秋海棠已覺得這件事已不能再含糊了。</p>
<p>「大嫂，請坐一會，咱們說幾句話行不行？」他竭力把自己的態度和語氣的束得像平常一樣的溫和，因爲他也很明白孟家的小內掌櫃是一個十足的草包，她把梅賣介紹給尚老二學戲，倒眞是一片純粹的好心，所以絕對不願遷怒於她。</p>

<h3>最近的兩次詩歌朗誦</h3>
<p>— 勞勃</p>
<p>詩歌朗誦雖然巳經提倡了很久，但是除了少數詩入自己練習和偶爾公開朗誦一次之外，便很少有讓大家聽到的機會。聽說去年年底，重慶的詩人們會有詩歌朗誦隊的組織，預備分隊到四鄉各處去朗誦，一時甚爲轟動，但不久文化界離渝者甚多，詩歌朗誦隊的工作也似乎無形停頓了。</p>
<p>去年上海曾有過三次的詩歌朗誦會，一次是行列社主辦的春季朗誦會，還有兩次是在高爾基和魯迅兩位大文豪的紀念會中舉行的，似乎很引起了一些人的興趣和注意。但是今年以來，半年中間，却沒有聽到有什麼朗誦會的舉行。直到最近，我們才又一渾聽到了兩次的詩歌朗誦，不覺大感興趣</p>
<p>這兩次詩歌朗誦似乎都不是詩入們在書齊裏練習了朗誦再公開出來的，相反的，這兩次朗誦的人是幾　舞台明星和靑年學生，詩歌朗誦會擴大出詩人們的小圈子以外，這倒是很有利詩歌朗誦的展開的。</p>
<p>第一次是上月的二十九日，大陸月刋假座新新玻璃電台的文藝廣播第一次在上海出現，裏面除了劇藝社廣播的話劇「求婚」，陳致通廣播的張天翼的小說「稀鬆的戀愛故事」和許多珍貴的音樂節目外，還有藍蘭小姐的朗誦雪萊的名詩「西風歌」，葉璟珍小姐的朗誦普式庚的名詩「離別了故鄕」；張紉禮小姐朗誦的冀汸的創作詩「月季花」，從空中廣播到每架收音機中，當我收聽到那淸麗的聲音時，確乎給我以非常新奇的感覺。</p>
<p>第二次是豎琴文藝社舉行的夏令詩歌朗誦會，也已經在本月三日，在女靑年會大禮堂舉行了。節目很多，連實騐音樂團參加的音樂節目在內，不下三十餘項。大致上，以班卓小姐朗誦的荒牧的詩「母親」，珂靑小姐朗誦的朱維基的詩「魯迅先生誕辰」，沈洛小姐朗誦的白曙的詩「太行山下吹征塵」，韓流朗誦的鍚金的詩「黃昏星」，吳獲朗誦的裴馬斐名詩「狗的歌」，「狼的歌」爲較好。不過許多朗誦者的聲音都太低，對於語言和詩的理解都還缺少把握，成績上，顯然實騐音樂團的許多歌詠節目是壓蓋了一切的。</p>
<p>但這不是詩歌朗誦的前途不及歌詠的燦爛，正是詩歌朗誦者也須要像音樂者一樣的加重發音，咬字，節奏，情緒等等基本技術的練習。希望會由於大家的更多注意和提倡，有那麼一天，詩歌朗誦像彈詞大鼓一像的普及到民間。</p>
<h3>紀玉良的前程</h3>
<p>— 章崧然</p>
<p>上月杪，往黃金觀全部王寳釧，趕三關以前各折，胥爲班串，除閻世善艾世菊稍可提神之外，餘子均巳黃花老去，不足道矣。閻世善來日頗有芙蓉草之地位，人綠旣佳，藝也不惡，更無敷衍之陋習。若能於武功以外各劇，再事潛心研磨，宋德珠不敵也。艾世菊前隨毛世來蒞滬，初隸黃金時，做戲認眞，小放半盜鈎諸劇，演來無不恰到好處，大受一時擁護，近似每况愈下，日趨萎靡，豈搭配不當而無用武之地耶？第爲黃金基本演員，較自甘沒落之裘盛戎，似已强勝多多矣。</p>
<p>鄭冰如因係一坤角，故捧之者衆，但拜聆之下，大失所望，口中陰陽不辨，入聲字忒多，如「刀下留人」唸成「到下留人」，故白口殊覺刺耳，大登殿之二六及流水尚可一聽，然除要腔之外，字眼則充耳不聞。</p>
<p>最後談及紀玉良，人咸謂其非譚非馬，亦有人謂其完全學馬，不值一提，惟我觀此人，年雖幼，尚守規矩，唱唸及詞句，俱通大路，台步亦好看，僅重音字略肖馬之大舌頭，或天賦如此，非大病也。我對其印象甚佳，望其嗣後力避馬之短，取譚之長，再宗楊（實森）之正路，不出三載，必能壓倒奚嘯伯管紹華之輩，或更超乎王少樓陳少霖等之上矣。</p>
<p>比者，黃金所邀之郭春陽，因病打泡三天，即悄然輟演，仍以屈居鄭氷如下之紀玉良掛正牌，時勢造英雄，我深慶之下，望紀善用此種機會，好自爲之，母驕母懈，莫效馬之浮滑與自作聰明，以新奇炫人，莫效馬之搖頭扭股，嗡鼻大舌，有厚望焉。</p>

        <h1>1941.08.07</h1>
<h3>Report that the US President Will Meet with the British Prime Minister: Secret Discussions on Important Strategies, with a Focus on How to Support the Soviet Union Against Germany. US Envoy Hopkins Will Also Attend</h3>
<p>United Press, London, June 6th: Sources within the British government stated yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill and US Lend-Lease Envoy Hopkins are "together" at an undisclosed location. Observers speculate that the two may be flying to meet with President Roosevelt, who is currently vacationing on the yacht "Potomac" off the US East Coast. According to official statements here, the House of Commons is currently holding a debate on the progress of the war, but Prime Minister Churchill is unable to attend due to "inconvenience." British sources also said that Churchill's absence from the House debate is due to extremely urgent matters related to the war. The "Daily Mail" reported that "three high-ranking British officials," possibly Churchill, or Lord Beaverbrook, will fly to the United States to meet with Roosevelt. Hopkins' whereabouts have been very secretive since returning to England from Moscow, but well-informed British sources say, "You can find Hopkins near the Prime Minister." They refused to suggest where the two are. The US Embassy issued an official statement that Hopkins is "recovering" somewhere in England. As for Prime Minister Churchill's absence from the House debate, it was announced by the Lord Privy Seal and Deputy Leader of the House, Attlee.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, June 6th: There was talk here yesterday that Prime Minister Churchill might cross the Atlantic to meet President Roosevelt at sea, but well-informed sources considered it doubtful. At the same time, neither official nor private sources have acknowledged or denied this claim. Everyone is asking where Churchill is, but no one can answer. Yesterday, British Lord Privy Seal Attlee's statement in the House of Commons that the Prime Minister would not participate in the debate on the war was acknowledged by a Washington newspaper as an indication that the British Prime Minister would meet with President Roosevelt at sea, and speculated that US Presidential Envoy Hopkins would also attend. However, Secretary of State Hull was unable to comment on the matter, but said that when he met with the President on Saturday night, he was unaware that the British Prime Minister would be meeting with the President. Many believe that the US President is unlikely to leave the US coast as far as Iceland, and Churchill would find it difficult to travel far beyond Iceland. However, everyone agrees that it would be excellent if the British and American leaders could meet.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: Early this morning, attention here continued to focus intensely on reports from London that Prime Minister Churchill, President Roosevelt, and Hopkins are secretly discussing important strategies in the North Atlantic. If Churchill and Roosevelt have indeed met in person, it must be related to Hopkins' recent visit to the Soviet Union, and to prevent future Japanese advances to the south. At the same time, the conference will also discuss the evolution of the war situation, especially the recent strong resistance of the Soviet Union against Germany and how to support Soviet resistance. Some experts here say that Japan's occupation of Vietnam and the deployment of troops on the Thai border will undoubtedly be discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill, and that due to the difficulty of freezing the existing situation in the Pacific, they may take greater pressure on Japan if necessary.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Cruises at Sea, Meets with Fleet Commander</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, June 6th: Official sources from the US presidential yacht stated that after a restful night, the President continued to cruise north at sea, destination yet to be announced. The President, wearing sportswear, enjoys the sea air. When asked about the extent of the cruise, the President replied that there was no fixed location, and daily actions would depend on the weather and fishing conditions. The President sometimes discusses matters with the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: American and foreign officials here yesterday did not speculate on the possibility of President Roosevelt meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill. The Navy Department reminded reporters that the White House and Secretary of the Navy Knox had previously asked reporters not to make all sorts of speculations about the President's current trip. White House Secretary O'Leary said that he had no knowledge of the meeting between the two.</p>
<p>United Press, Miami, June 6th: Newspapers here today published a report from reliable diplomatic sources in Washington stating that on Thursday afternoon, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting on a ship in the North Atlantic. The report also stated that British and Canadian sources in Washington said that Roosevelt and Churchill met off the coast of New Brunswick, while another said the meeting took place off the coast of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: Secretary of State Hull and British Embassy officials yesterday said they were unaware of reports that President Roosevelt would meet with Prime Minister Churchill. Another senior naval official said that if the President had such a meeting planned, the information would be released in the daily radio bulletin at a time deemed appropriate by the President. The yacht "Potomac" on which President Roosevelt is traveling is equipped with machine guns and underwater telegraph cables for protection against mines, making it very suitable for sea travel, but not for long voyages.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Ecuador, South America, Intensifies, Japan Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, June 6th: Japan has recently issued a note to Ecuador, South America, demanding that it stop anti-Japanese actions and protect Japanese residents. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday that Ecuador has recently claimed that several Japanese residents are suspected of espionage and will be deported, believing unfounded rumors that Japanese residents have joined the Peruvian army to make trouble for Ecuador. The Japanese government has lodged a strong protest, but anti-Japanese sentiment is still spreading in Ecuador. The Japanese government believes that this matter can be resolved peacefully soon, but it is currently awaiting Ecuador's official reply.</p>
<h3>McNutt Advocates Joint Stand by China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands to Prevent Japan's Continued Southern Advance</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: Former US High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator McNutt declared last night that the only way to prevent further Japanese aggression is for China, Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies to take a firm joint stand in the Far East. He has consistently advocated that the United States should adopt a firm Far East policy. In a separate meeting with a United Press reporter, he emphasized that he was speaking as an American citizen, not as a government official. However, it is worth noting that most of the Far East policies he advocates have recently been followed and adopted by the government. He said that Japan will encounter joint action by democratic countries in the Far East. He emphasized that Japan's actions have united its neighbors in the Pacific into an effective anti-Japanese front. He also said, "If an accident occurs in the Pacific, the sixteen million Filipinos will remain completely loyal to the United States. The Philippines is the only paradise in the unhappy East. Filipinos do not want to accept Japanese aggression." He also said that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands should use their military position. These countries are currently confronting Japan in various ways in the South, and in the North there is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's current national interests are in the same direction as ours. There is currently only one reasonable and successful policy to follow: we should make it clear to Japan that if Japan goes any further, it will inevitably lead to war. I believe that Japan does not want to choose war.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, June 6th: Japanese newspapers today said that the Japan-Vietnam joint defense plan has freed Japan from worries about its rear, and that recent attention has shifted to the Siberian issue. Newspapers also discussed the possibility of the Soviet Union uniting with Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies to encircle Japan.</p>
<p>British Parliamentarians Urge Increased Restraint on Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, London, June 6th: In the House of Commons yesterday, a Liberal parliamentarian, who spoke frankly about the assistance provided by the United States to Britain's blockade against Germany, requested assurance that the economic sanctions imposed in the Far East be consistent, so that Japan cannot obtain oil and other war supplies from British, American, and Dutch East Indies territories. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that discussions with relevant governments are still underway regarding the implementation of the far-reaching financial control measures that have already been promulgated. Undoubtedly, these measures have been put into practice and are not empty words, and their impact on Japan's acquisitions will be quite serious. Labour parliamentarian Noel-Baker said that the best way to prevent war in the Far East is to immediately stop all oil supplies, and this impression should be given to the United States. Butler replied that the US government is familiar with this situation.</p>
<h3>US Appoints Military Attaché to Australia, Two Heavy Cruisers Refuel in Australia</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: Authoritative sources announced yesterday that the United States has appointed Colonel Miles Smith as the new military attaché to Australia, and Lieutenant O'Connell as his assistant. The two will leave here in two weeks. The United States has sent a naval attaché to Australia, but this is the first military attaché.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, June 6th: The Navy Department revealed yesterday that two US heavy cruisers are currently refueling in Brisbane, Australia. It is said that the above-mentioned two ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Hepburn, will leave here in a few days. Due to recent reports that the US fleet is heading east, the Navy's news has aroused interest among the general public.</p>
<h3>Dutch Government Resolves Not to Relocate, East Indies Government Statement: Continue to Increase Defense Equipment</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, June 6th: The Dutch East Indies government has reiterated in the People's Council that there is no question of the Dutch government relocating. Britain's resistance is now increasing daily. Our belief in the victory of the Allied countries is even greater than before, and London is the best place for the Dutch government to advance its war efforts as the center of the war. As for the situation in the Pacific, it is now appropriate to continue to increase the defense equipment of the Dutch East Indies and increase economic and spiritual self-defense. The ordered war supplies are now arriving in large quantities. Special attention is now being paid to obtaining the latest defense war supplies. The plans for enlightened manufacturing of munitions and explosives have reached a higher stage.</p>
<h3>US Department of Justice Recommends Authorizing Governor of Honolulu</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, June 6th: Reliable sources here said yesterday that the Department of Justice has drafted a bill to be submitted to Congress, granting the Governor of Hawaii the power to deal freely with the activities of citizens in times of emergency, should an incident occur in the Far East. The bill has been submitted to the Army Department for review. Once approved, it will be introduced to Congress by someone in the government who supports the bill.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States to Make Major Decisions on the Pacific and Aid to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press, London, June 6th: Observers here believed yesterday that future British and American talks will lead to major decisions on the Pacific and aid to the Soviet Union. It is increasingly recognized here that democratic countries' economic sanctions against Japan are too lenient, failing to prevent Japan's southern advance and threat to the Soviet Union. According to reliable estimates from non-British sources, in the past two weeks, the Japanese have sent about 100,000 troops to reinforce the more than 250,000 troops stationed in "Manchukuo." These people are asking each other whether, if democratic countries are so eager to remove the Japanese threat in the South Pacific, they are willing to take strong steps to prevent Japan from attacking the Soviet Union or even forcing the Soviet Union to mobilize a large Red Army in the Far East. Soviet sources believe that the most important assistance that democratic countries can provide to the Soviet Union is to warn Japan not to approach the Soviet Maritime Provinces. Observers recalled that on July 13, Britain and the Soviet Union formally cooperated in fighting Germany. Commentators doubt whether this cooperation can be extended to the Far East. Since democratic countries have agreed to defeat Germany to protect common interests, it can be considered that they will never sit idly by and watch Japan take actions that could distract the Soviet Union's efforts to fight Germany. It is also believed here that unless democratic countries offer the Dutch East Indies a full guarantee of assistance in resisting aggression, it seems excessive to ask the Dutch East Indies to fully join in economic sanctions against Japan. Regarding the more tangible issues related to Britain, it is the extent to which Britain is willing to implement US measures that are beneficial to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Forty Towns in India to Build Air Raid Shelters, Malay Defense Strength Increased, Australia Builds More Than Fifty Ships</h3>
<p>Reuters, Simla, June 6th: About forty towns in India, listed as areas vulnerable to attack, will immediately build air raid shelters. The minimum standard of protection is to resist the explosive force and shrapnel of a 500-pound high-explosive bomb dropped from 50 feet away, and the debris from nearby building collapses.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, June 6th: A British troop, including some marines and soldiers, has just arrived here to increase the strength of the Malay defense. This British troop arrived here by ship from a port in northwestern Britain. No accidents occurred. When arriving, Indian troops participated in the escort. Prince Basrah also came here from India to inspect the Indian troops stationed in Malaya. When the troop carrier docked, senior military officers from the sea, land, and air forces came to welcome him, and Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Brooke-Popham even boarded the ship to pay his respects to Prince Basrah.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, June 6th: Australian Army Minister Spender recently released figures revealing the extent of Australia's war effort. It is said that Australia will build more than fifty naval vessels, including minesweepers, patrol boats, and tribal-class destroyers. Since the start of the war, Australian naval personnel have increased three and a half times, and there are still volunteers. There are 5,000 people a year. The strength of the Australian Air Force is equivalent to three army divisions.</p>

<h3>The Emergency in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is turbulent, and the situation in the Far East is showing unprecedented tension. Even though the war in Europe continues on a large scale, its importance cannot be diminished, but the center of gravity of the entire world is undoubtedly falling on the Far East. The notion of subordinating Eastern events to the European war is outdated. At least for now, the events that are sufficient to affect the largest part of the world are not the partial advances and retreats of the Soviet-German war, but the looming but constantly developing crisis in the Pacific. Ten years ago, the sparks of war in the Far East began to destroy the peace and order of the world. Today, in terms of reversing the chaos and rectifying the root causes, we should first thoroughly liquidate the Far East.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the events that have occurred in the Far East are almost as significant as the sum of the events that have occurred in this area in the past decade. There are indeed signs that the Tripartite Pact is not being strictly observed in the Far East, but it is not turning to approach the democratic countries. Instead, it is seeking to be unattached and unconstrained, to obtain the greatest freedom of action, and to take absolutely self-interested and unlimited expansion as its ultimate goal. This can be seen in practical measures: internally, it is to step up the mobilization of materials and complete a highly defensive system; externally, it is to plan for both southern and northern advances, while not neglecting the war against China. The collapse of the entire base in Vietnam, the breaking of the balance of power in the Indochinese Peninsula, and the fact that Thailand is isolated and helpless and has to rely on strong support in order to preserve itself - this is a major change that has never occurred in Southeast Asia in half a century; and in Northeast Asia, we see large armies gathering and stepping up deployments, and a new war is about to break out, with its realistic danger perhaps greater than in the South Seas. Which way the southern and northern advances will go is of course not something that anyone can predict, and perhaps we will have to wait for the arrival of favorable opportunities to decide. But in general, it seems that the measures taken in the Indochinese Peninsula may only be for future needs, while the deployments in the Northeast are pregnant with a decisive step. The importance of the South Seas and the coastal provinces of the East Sea may vary from person to person, but at this time when the Sino-US-British-Soviet anti-aggression front is about to be completed, the gain or loss of Vladivostok has the same significance as Singapore. It is also something that the anti-aggression front cannot ignore. And although Singapore is an impregnable fortress, in terms of the offensive strategy in the Western Pacific, it is not as valuable as Vladivostok. This may be the reason why the situation in the Northeast has been more tense than in the South Seas recently.</p>
<p>In democratic countries and even the Soviet Union, they certainly do not want to see the expansion and outbreak of war in the Far East, so as not to distract their attention from the European situation. Therefore, the economic sanctions imposed by Britain and the United States are quite flexible. Although the Soviet Union suffered a loss in the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, it still hopes that the Neutrality Pact will not follow in its footsteps. On the other hand, in the midst of harshness and arbitrariness, they have not failed to be prudent in their actions. Regarding the retaliation for freezing funds, it is clearly stated that it will be changed according to the attitude of the United States. After the oil embargo was finally implemented, they did not fulfill their previous threats about the oil embargo. Instead, they expressed their willingness to adopt a more moderate policy and stop further aggression, only asking the United States to recognize its position as the leader in East Asia. This condition is certainly not acceptable to the United States, but it may not be a smoke screen released for bargaining. Ogura's article and Wakisugi's return to Japan show the activeness of this attempt. But for these circumstances, rather than considering them as reefs in the future of the anti-aggression movement in the Far East, it is better to regard them as the hesitation of the moment before reaching the final stage, because acts of aggression can often be initiated but cannot be stopped, and stopping at the edge of a cliff can only be expected of great wisdom and courage. If there is still a possibility of saving the Far East crisis, there have been countless opportunities in the past decade, regardless of what was encountered.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupts Again in Central Hubei, Japanese Troops Attacking Haoxue are Repelled, Chinese Troops Capturing Haozikou Continue to Advance Westward, More Than Half of the Japanese Troops Encircled in Huangjiachang are Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News, (1) Japanese troops attacking China from Jiangjunnao and Erliuguo were reinforced on the morning of the 5th. After the Chinese army resisted desperately, the battle became more fierce. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese also suffered casualties. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are still fighting on the line near Baiguoyuan, Zhenlongwangdong, and Caojiabu. (2) The Japanese troops surrounded in Huangjiachang, Zhubaoshan, Guojiachong, Pangjialing, Yangjiawan, and other places were pursued and annihilated separately, with most of them killed or wounded. It will not be difficult to annihilate all of them. (3) The Chinese army near Yichang attacked the Japanese troops in Nanjinguan, a suburb of Yichang, and the highlands east of it on the evening of the 30th of last month, fighting with the Japanese until dawn on the 31st, killing more than 200 Japanese and seizing many spoils. (4) This time, the Japanese army in central Hubei divided into four routes to attack Haoxue. After the strong Chinese troops fought back on separate routes, two routes attacked from the south of Shashi Cenhekou had reached Pengjiachang in Haoxue and were severely attacked by the strong Chinese troops. Unable to hold on, they collapsed to the north, and the Chinese are tracking and pursuing them. One route that attacked Yangjiaqiao from the south of Shashiangjingkou was defeated and retreated to the north. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to recapture Haozikou, and surrounded the remaining Japanese troops in Lujiadian and Jiadian (both east of Hougang) separately. Another route of Japanese troops attacked from the south of Qianjiang, Jiangnan, and was intercepted in the area east of Xiongkoushi. The fierce battle lasted until the 5th. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. (June 6th dispatch)</p>

This morning, the Chinese army lured the Japanese troops to Pengjiachang, north of Haoxue (south of Haozikou), and ambushed them on the highway. After a bloody battle at 1 pm, the Japanese troops could not hold on and retreated to the north. The Chinese troops are now pursuing them separately to Qianjiangqiao, Huangjiachang, Rangqiao, and other places. There are currently no traces of Japanese troops in Pengjiachang and Xihukou.

<h3>London Times Elaborates on the Sino-Japanese Situation: China Able to Weather Economic Difficulties, Japan's Position Increasingly Precarious</h3>
<p>London - The "Times" today published an exclusive article discussing the situation in China, stating that the Chinese people feel that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is beneficial to China, confident in their own ability and the material assistance from other countries (ABC), and are certain to prolong the war for several years. At the same time, it is felt that Japan's position is becoming increasingly precarious. Economic problems have already disrupted it, and there is no certainty of assistance from allies. Although it is eager to act, with hundreds of thousands of troops trapped in China and unable to move freely, what can Japan hope for by provoking conflict with the Soviet Union, Britain, the Netherlands, India, and the United States? The campaign against China has now entered its fifth year, and it has not yet been possible to end the Chinese affair. It wants to befriend Germany, but Germany has already broken faith with the Soviet Union. How can one be sure it will not break faith with the old? It wants to obtain oil from India, but the Dutch are prepared to destroy their oil at any time. Is there anything surprising? The Chinese feel that if they can weather the economic difficulties, they can have a future based on the victory of the Allied nations, because the victory of the Allied nations is a necessary condition for a truly new order. Under this new order, the Chinese can rebuild China, seeking welfare for themselves and not for foreign masters. What China needs most urgently today is the economy. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that the war of resistance and national construction accounts for 30% in military affairs and 70% in the economy. Foreign experts generally believe that Japan's increased efforts to blockade China cannot alone cause China's economic collapse. China's crisis lies within. Many difficulties have naturally arisen during the four years of resistance and national construction. The important test now is the strategy to deal with these difficulties. Although the Chinese authorities are confident in their ability to weather the economic difficulties, they recognize the difficulty of controlling food prices in the inland areas. Although those in Sichuan Province who hoard grain for speculation are severely punished, grain prices have still not been suppressed. When the newly established Ministry of People's Food has made significant progress in the future, it will be able to eliminate some or all of the hidden dangers in the current situation. Foreign experts generally believe that the most serious of China's economic problems is inflation, but it has not yet reached a critical point, such as that experienced by Germany after World War I. However, to avoid future troubles, measures should be taken immediately. If the Chinese show the same determination, resolve, and courage as they have shown in overcoming many difficulties in the past, then future troubles can certainly be eliminated. Although the Chinese are concerned about the future economy, they have greater faith in the political future. Dr. Quo Tai-chi's return to the country to take up the post of Foreign Minister is the most important event. This is not only the case in China, but also related to other ABC countries. Since Foreign Minister Quo took office, his strict policies have placed him at the forefront of Chinese leaders. China's severing of relations with Germany has cleared up Chongqing's position, and the United States has capable ambassadors as representatives. If the relationship between the three ABC countries fails to reach a stage of greater significance, the responsibility does not lie with Foreign Minister Quo. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is what the Allied nations in China have gained, and what the Axis powers have lost in China. In the past, 30,000 tons of military supplies were exported from the Far East via Siberia every month. Now that this has been cut off, it is a major blow to Germany, and Germany's export trade, which has been increasingly developed on this route, has also suddenly stopped. The impact on Germany is not small. In the future, German merchants in China can hardly hope to restore the superior position they enjoyed in the great Chinese market in the past. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jie Delivers a Speech in Washington</h3>
<p>Washington - Our former ambassador to Germany, Chen Jie, delivered a speech last night to Chinese and American people at a banquet held by the United Relief for Chinese War Refugees. He stated that China will continue to serve as a leader against aggression in the Far East, and will cooperate with the United States and Britain to fight for the creation of a peaceful, stable, democratic, and civilized world. After Germany recognized the Nanjing organization, China severed diplomatic relations with Germany. This move has placed China in a position of irreconcilable opposition to the forces of aggression, and it will continue to oppose any appeasement of the Axis powers. Hitler and German military figures all believe that China is one of the countries with the strongest land army in the world, and it is impossible to subdue it to Japan. The German side admires the determination of our Chairman Chiang in the war of resistance and national construction. We are very grateful for the assistance given to China by the democratic countries in the past. In the future, China, Britain, and the United States must be absolutely united. If the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands intensify economic sanctions against Japan, continue to provide large amounts of material assistance to China, and protect the Burma Road, then China will be able to launch a full-scale counter-offensive and quickly defeat Japan.

<p>Remittances from Malaya to Hong Kong are Unrestricted: According to reliable information obtained by the Central News Agency in Singapore, after Hong Kong joins the pound sterling bloc, remittances from Malaya to Hong Kong will be freely remitted from today without official restrictions. It is expected that remittances from overseas Chinese here to China will also resume remittances in the near future. (5th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government authorities announced that Chinese funds in Hong Kong are not included in the list of counterpart deposits. Remittances for use by overseas Chinese will be facilitated as much as possible, and banks and merchants will be specially allowed to purchase necessary food supplies. However, after the implementation of the counterpart deposit order, Chinese businessmen will inevitably suffer considerable difficulties. It is hoped that they will be tolerant. It is also said that remittances from Japanese people in Hong Kong have been completely stopped. (5th, Chang)</p>
<h3>Four Banks Allocate Funds to Reward Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Economic Conference of the Executive Yuan yesterday resolved that the general offices of the four banks should allocate 60 million yuan each year for the purpose of encouraging various important production enterprises, of which 10 million yuan must be used as circulating funds for various enterprises, and the remainder should be used to purchase important products in order to avoid stimulating their production. This measure was proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which in turn was based on the request of the Southwest Industrial Federation. (Havas Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Central Daily News Advocates Requisitioning Foreign Exchange Owned by Chinese Citizens to Replenish Legal Tender Reserves</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an editorial today advocating that after the United States and Britain deposit Chinese funds, the state should requisition all foreign exchange owned by Chinese citizens. The newspaper pointed out that "market men with foreign exchange" have not made a fair contribution to the war of resistance and national construction, and have even been causing trouble in the market and disrupting people's livelihood. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration for the government to compensate for the requisition, which is beneficial to the country and does no harm to individuals, in terms of reason and emotion. Although the government does not need a large amount of foreign exchange now, in order to replenish the legal tender reserves after the war and raise the large amount of funds needed for reconstruction and construction, it should also take this opportunity to generally requisition it. As for the discounted price of the requisitioned foreign exchange, it should be deposited in the bank designated by the foreign exchange owner, and its withdrawal should be restricted in accordance with the regulations on stabilizing finance. After the end of the war in the future, the government should still use compulsory methods to use it as the price for purchasing state-owned enterprises or designated private enterprise stocks. This investment can be guaranteed by the state with principal and interest. (Havas Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Members of the Visit to Burma Delegation Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The members of the Chinese Goodwill Mission to Burma met today to finalize the plans for this trip. It is reported that the delegation will fly from Chongqing to Yangon by special plane on August 27. They will stay in Burma for about two weeks. The head of the delegation is Jiang Menglin, the former Minister of Education and current president of Southwest Associated University, and the deputy heads are Zeng Yangfu, the former vice minister of railways, and Miao Yuntai (transliteration), the manager of the Fudian Bank. There are eleven members of the delegation, including Tang Dechen, the director of the English Department of the Central News Agency. It is reported that Tang will conduct preliminary negotiations on establishing a central branch in Yangon during his stay in Burma. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Retreat is resistance. Accommodation is condemnation, and even then there is no way to change its consistent attempt to expand, let alone today? These circumstances are well known to the major statesmen of the world, so the world does not have to worry too much that the leading figures in defending democracy will fall into the evil path of appeasement. Initiative must be striven for. Loopholes must be blocked. But the overall trend cannot be doubted; under the gradual advance of the aggressors.</p>
<p>It has been rumored in recent days that British Prime Minister Churchill is meeting with US Special Envoy to Britain Hopkins and US President Roosevelt somewhere. If this statement is true, it is believable that what they are discussing must be the problem of the Pacific as the main focus; because the major events in the European situation are only aid to the Soviet Union and counter-offensive, but the latter cannot be achieved overnight, and the former does not need the top authorities of the two countries to discuss it. Only on the response to the Far East, both sides have a greater need to exchange views. Although Britain was the initiator of the appeasement policy in the Far East in the past, the current development in the Far East has seriously threatened the security of the British Empire. On the path of southward advance, Malaya and Singapore are of course the first to bear the brunt, and the northward advance to attack the Soviet Union also indirectly affects Britain's final battle against the Nazis. No matter how the attempt to ease the pressure from the United States proceeds, the British side cannot but strive for the complete removal of these threats, and it is not difficult to imagine that this conversation will inevitably produce concrete and effective results.</p>
<p>Since the era of the Far East began four years ago, it has now reached the stage of extreme prosperity and approaching the final liquidation! After this, perhaps there will be a difficult struggle, but in the end, the arrival of light is inevitable!</p>

<h3>German Troops Launch Fierce New Offensive Along a Wide Front, Claiming to Have Occupied Two Important Strongholds, Elite German Troops in the Northwest Area Are Defeated</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th - The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating that yesterday our army continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy in Smolensk, Kruston (northwest of Kiev), Bilaya Tserkov (south of Kiev), and the Estonian front. There were no important battles in other areas. Our air force did its best to assist the Red Army in fighting the enemy's mechanized units and inflicted heavy losses on them. As a result of our army's air battles and attacks on enemy airfields on the 4th, 53 enemy planes were shot down, and our side lost 21 planes.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - On the Northwest front (i.e., Finland, Estonia, Leningrad), our army heavily damaged the most elite SS division of the German army (i.e., the German shock troops). The division repeatedly attacked but was repelled, suffering 1,500 casualties and abandoning 60 machine guns and many other military supplies.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th - Responsible parties announced last night that the city of Bilaya Tserkov (45 miles south of Kiev) and the city of Holm on the Lovat River (between Smolensk and Leningrad) have fallen into the hands of the German army. Holm has a population of 20,000 and is located on a tributary of the Bug River. The area has always been regarded as one of the Soviet granaries.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The Red Army High Command announced that the Soviet Air Force yesterday launched a full-scale attack along the vast Soviet-German front, annihilating most of the German armored units and infantry. It also stated that victories were won on the Leningrad and Kiev fronts. The Red Army High Command issued a communique at midnight stating that the German 16th Motorized Division attempted to break through the Soviet defense line in the northwest area of the front, but was repelled. It is reported that 1,500 German soldiers were killed or wounded. Soviet military circles believe that although the German army may have broken through 70 miles in the area between Leningrad and Smolensk, this offensive must have stopped. The Soviet communique also stated that the German vanguard in the Kiev and Kruston areas has retreated due to the Soviet counter-offensive. A German infantry regiment was completely disintegrated in this battle. The conclusion of the Soviet communique stated that the Soviet air force bomber groups have heavily damaged the German army, and the German army's offensive power is now weakening.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses in Manpower and Equipment, German Blitzkrieg Plan Fails</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th - The Soviet Army organ "Red Star" commented on the failure of Hitler's blitzkrieg plan yesterday, stating that the war on the vast front has been going on for six weeks. Although the enemy has not been defeated, the failure of Hitler's blitzkrieg plan is already obvious. The three methods proposed by the German army command have been used one by one and have all failed. What are the three methods? That is, (1) concentrating tanks and aircraft, followed by motorized infantry, to strike at a designated point; (2) attempting to advance simultaneously with all its strength in extremely important directions; (3) fighting on the entire front in order to discover points that are easy to attack. The Fascist newspapers are no longer full of praise for the blitzkrieg, and Goebbels has recently said that Germany must make greater sacrifices. This is evidence that the Fascist war machine that is carrying out the blitzkrieg has suffered a major failure. Fascists did not take into account the resistance of the Red Army, or the true nature of the war, or the vastness of the front when calculating the blitzkrieg. The German leaders have great confidence in their air force, but the German air force has not gained a decisive advantage, and the powerful Soviet air force is gradually gaining the upper hand. According to the German plan, the armored army must play an important role in the lightning-fast victory, but the Red Army's fierce counter-attacks often cut off the connection between the Nazi armored army and the infantry, and half of the German troops attacking on both sides were annihilated. Fascist infantry, accustomed to driving straight in behind tanks and aircraft, is now forced to fight alone, proving that their training for long marches is insufficient. The enemy has suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Hitler, who only relies on his omnipotent tanks, is now starting to talk about using rifles. No matter how large the German army is, its number will never be as large as the Red Army. The Soviet side is well aware of the enemy's strength and that its reserves have not been exhausted, but this war has just begun.</p>
<h3>British Military Experts Observe the War Situation, German New Offensive Seeks Weak Points</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 6th - Observers here believed yesterday that the purpose of the German army's fierce attack in the Holm area was either to expand the Leningrad front, or to suddenly attack the north side of the Smolensk salient. British military experts believe that the lowlands around Holm and the brambles of the Valdai Hills make it difficult to realize their attempt to advance along the road between Holm and Moscow. The news that the German army claimed to have occupied Bilaya Tserkov was released too late, and experts here have not yet commented on it, but the experts previously believed that the position of this city was very important. If the news reported by the Germans is true, then the fall of this city is a serious blow to the Soviet army's Ukrainian position, because military experts had previously pointed out that if Bilaya Tserkov was occupied by the German army, the railway between Kiev and Odessa would be cut off. However, these experts also said that the fall of this city would not hinder traffic bypassing Kiev to the east. Experts here also believe that the sudden outbreak of war in the Holm area is enough to show that the Germans have not been able to find a team that can take advantage of the situation in the entire Soviet front, including the Kiev part. The northwest front has now expanded to more than 200 miles, which is enough to show that the Germans are still looking around on this long front from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south, in order to find weak points and realize their desire to drive straight in. The views held by people here when observing the German-Soviet war are roughly based on the Soviet communique, because the repeated Soviet communiques indicate that the Soviet army is still effectively encircling and annihilating the attacking German army. British newspapers still attach great importance to the possibility of the German army launching a third general offensive. These experts pointed out that judging from the situation of the Soviet army's transportation of military supplies, especially fuel and oil, the Soviet army's position on the Smolensk and other fronts may now be more advantageous than the German army. Some well-informed experts believe that the German decision-making action must be concentrated in the Holm area, and it is expected that the Soviet army has concentrated a large number of troops there to prepare to meet the enemy.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Activities Within 300 Miles of the German Front Become More Intense</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - The "Truth Daily" published an editorial entitled "Forward Guerrilla Team," stating that guerrilla teams are fighting more resolutely, fiercely, and extensively behind enemy lines. Nazi personnel admit that the war in front is not as easy as it used to be, because guerrilla teams are all over the place within 200 to 300 miles of the German front. The glory of the heroic Soviet patriots behind enemy lines is too numerous to mention. In the cities and villages occupied by the Fascists, the people responded to Stalin's call, rose up to fight a holy war, organized guerrillas, attacked enemy troops behind enemy lines, blew up bridges and railways, destroyed telephone and telegraph lines, and set fire to forests and warehouses. Guerrilla teams pose a permanent threat to the enemy. A guerrilla team in the Belarusian region suddenly attacked the enemy's motorized infantry, killing 100 German soldiers. In another area, a guerrilla team used bottles containing fuel to destroy 18 enemy heavy tanks. Twenty kilometers north of City D, a guerrilla team attacked a large unit of enemy infantry, using machine guns and rifle fire to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. There are many such incidents, too numerous to mention. The first to initiate these struggles were the Belarusian and Ukrainian peasants, because they were the first to bear the brunt of the enemy's abuse. The Belarusian guerrilla teams vow not to lay down their weapons until all the Nazi villains have been driven out of the territory of Belarus.</p>
<h3>German Army Issues Special War Report</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 1 this afternoon, which stated that General Lieb's corps crossed the Daugava River between Daugavpils and Riga, and after clearing the enemy troops in Latvia, it will break through the Stalin defense line along the Soviet border and simultaneously attack the Soviet army in Estonia. General Buch's army, together with General Hopner's armored units, broke through the Soviet army's positions south of Lake Peipus and occupied Ostrov, Pskov, and Plisa. The German army can now attack Leningrad from the north. The German army's left wing advanced towards Narva between Lake Ilmen and Lake Peipus in order to cut off the connection between Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. General Koshler's army occupied the towns of Dubate and Pyllovo in Estonia. The enemy army lost 355 tanks and 655 artillery pieces, and 35,000 people were captured by the German army. General Keller's air force shot down and destroyed 771 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 3 today, which stated that General Bock's corps on the Eastern Front has concluded the Battle of Smolensk and achieved victory. The area, time, and war situation of the battle were unprecedented. The armies under General Kluge, General Strauss, and General Weichs, and the tank corps under General Guderian and General Hoth, heavily damaged the enemy army in fierce battles on all sides, capturing 310,000 people and seizing and destroying 3,205 tanks, 3,120 artillery pieces, and many other war materials. The air force under General Kesselring destroyed 1,098 Soviet aircraft. The details of the battle will be announced in tomorrow's war report.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 2 today, which stated that General Rundstedt's corps fought against the Soviet army on the southern flank. The armies under General Stülpnagel and General Kleist repelled the enemy army after fierce battles and advanced from Berdichev towards Kiev. The German army has penetrated into the rear of the Stalin defense line and can now advance south between the Dniester River and the Dnieper River, cutting off the enemy army's rear lines of communication and implementing a strategic encirclement. The Hungarian and Slovak armies fought alongside the German army and achieved considerable results. At the same time, the Romanian General Antonescu led the German-Romanian allied forces and recovered Bessarabia, and left a division under General Cibourg to cross the Dniester River and advance north to link up with the German army in the north. The German army captured 150,000 people and seized 1,970 tanks and 2,190 artillery pieces. General Lörzer's air force assisted in the battle, shooting down and destroying 981 Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Fuhrer Headquarters, 6th - The German Army Command issued Special War Report No. 4 today, which stated that the total number of enemy officers and soldiers captured by the German army on the Eastern European battlefield reached 895,000, and the total number of enemy tanks seized and destroyed reached 13,145. In addition, the total number of enemy artillery pieces seized and destroyed reached 10,388, and the number of aircraft reached 9,082. Compared with the statistics announced in the war report on July 11, the number of prisoners has now doubled. At that time, there were 40 prisoners, and the number of enemy aircraft seized and destroyed was 6,233.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Norway Restore Diplomatic Relations, Both Sides Exchange Documents in London Yesterday, Soviet-Southern Treaty Still Valid</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - The Soviet Union and Norway have restored diplomatic relations. Yesterday, the Norwegian Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, exchanged documents. Both sides expressed their willingness to send ministers to each other. Regarding this matter, the Norwegian Government Information Office issued a statement by the Norwegian Foreign Minister as follows: "I am delighted to take this opportunity to express my pleasure at the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between us and the Soviet Union. Norway has maintained good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union for many years, and there have never been any disagreements between the two governments during the World War. Both sides naturally desire to see this friendly relationship strengthened and developed. At a time when the Soviet soldiers and civilians are fighting bravely against the German invasion, we are delighted that the Soviet-Norwegian relationship can be strengthened and developed. The operations of the Soviet soldiers and civilians have aroused the admiration of the world. Hitler's Germany is our common enemy. If Germany wins, Norway and the whole world will be oppressed and enslaved."</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th - The official spokesman, Lozovsky, was asked at a reception for journalists yesterday whether the Soviet-Southern Treaty signed in the spring was still valid, because the Soviet side had announced new agreements with Poland and Czechoslovakia, but had not announced this with the Southern country. Lozovsky replied that the normal relationship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia had been interrupted for a long time and needed to be restored. As for the Southern country, the return of the Southern Minister to Moscow indicated that the previous treaty was still valid.</p>
<h3>German Planes Raid Soviet Capital Again at Night, Only a Few Planes Reach the City Air</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - Moscow Radio reported that several batches of German planes raided Moscow on Tuesday night. Only a few stray enemy planes reached the city air, and did not cause major damage. The rest of the enemy planes were scattered by anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. Five German planes were shot down. Because the German side claimed that the great Stalin automobile factory in Moscow had been destroyed, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Lozovsky, invited reporters from various newspapers to visit the factory today.</p>
<h3>Indian Government Declares Finland an Enemy Territory</h3>

<h3>Ramblings on the European War (7)(3) - A firsthand Account of Atlantic Convoy Duty</h3>
<p>This is a firsthand account by the famous American journalist Quentin Reynolds, who was aboard a cargo ship in a convoy from Canada to England. The following is a translation of his experiences:</p>
<p>The ship had been loading for three days. The continuous grinding noise of the massive winches filled the air. The cargo hold was almost full. This was a ten-thousand-ton cargo ship, but we had loaded it with seventeen thousand tons of goods. All kinds of items were included, almost without exception, including covered tugs, four airplanes, several tons of farm equipment, and hundreds of baskets of food.</p>
<p>The work on the deck was temporarily eased for a while, and then the winches and cranes became busy again. A large basket was carefully lifted up and quickly placed into the cargo hold. Another basket followed, and their careful manner suggested that it was full of eggs. In reality, the baskets were filled with something even more precious than eggs. They were filled with various powerful explosives, being hoisted onto the ship basket after basket.</p>
<p>The mate said with a smile, "Five hundred tons in total, a very good cargo."</p>
<p>Our ship was one of the ships in a convoy bound for England, part of the lifeline supplying the British with arms and food. Our ship had been docked for three days, loading cargo. We would stay in the harbor for two more days, waiting for the other ships to gather and load.</p>
<p>We finally set sail. The ships streamed out of the harbor one after another, an unprecedented assembly. There were small cargo ships flying the flags of Greece and Norway, as well as ships flying the Dutch flag, the Danish flag, and even the Swedish flag. We were now in a single line, our ship second in line, probably arranged according to size. The ships behind us stretched for miles. Once we were outside the harbor, the ships would form a fan shape or a cow line formation. From then on, only the shipmasters would know how to proceed. Within an hour, the pilot would leave the ship, and he was permitted to submit my report to the Canadian inspector for forwarding to Collier's magazine. How much of the convoy's information could be published was beyond my knowledge.</p>
<p>The ship we were on was the Blue Funnel Line's Talamba, a ten-thousand-ton vessel. She had sailed in the Far East for many years. She still retained her original Pacific sailors, no fewer than a hundred, of whom seventy-eight were Chinese.</p>
<p>There were only four passengers on the ship: a Danish technical consultant named Peransen, a British engineer named Gantler, a British food ministry official named Hobson, and myself. There were only two cabins on the ship, so we had to share a cabin with someone. I shared a cabin with Peransen. This turned out to be quite fortunate, as he liked to go to bed early and get up early, while I slept late and got up late. Although the cabin was only eight feet long and six feet wide, we each went our own way without intruding on each other.</p>
<p>The ship we were on was now slowly moving towards England. Her deck was only ten feet above the water, and the seventeen thousand tons of cargo had weighed her down as much as possible. Apart from the escorting warships, we were perhaps one of the fastest ships in the convoy, but we had to adjust our speed to match the slowest ship.</p>
<p>Like all cargo ships, we had armaments on board. We had five cannons. Two sailors managed the four-inch submarine gun at the stern, and four army soldiers, led by a corporal, managed four anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>The sailors were dismissive of the threat from submarines, but they dared not laugh at the bombers. Airplanes were indeed a problem, but the chances of being hit were slim. Lloyd's could provide insurance, charging only one percent. Being in a convoy was as safe as living in London during the Blitz—in fact, it was even safer, because there was no danger of being hit by a car under blackout conditions!</p>
<p>The sailors all received additional wartime pay for this voyage. The Chinese sailors' usual wage of thirty dollars a month was increased to fifty dollars a month in the convoy. The mate received an additional thirty-five dollars a month on top of his regular salary.</p>
<p>We expected this voyage to take eighteen days. From tonight, we would be under blackout conditions. The sides of the ship were painted black, and thick canvases hung over the doorways. We could not smoke on deck. We all had to keep our life preservers handy, and it was suggested that we should sleep in our clothes.</p>
<p>Looking back at Canada, there was only a faint yellow line, and in a few minutes, even that faint yellow line would disappear. We would not see land again until we reached England. I had eighteen detective novels in my suitcase and carefully planned to read one each day. We had plenty of food, plenty of drink, and an inexhaustible supply of fresh sea air, plus congenial company. I thought these eighteen days would pass easily.</p>
<p>Our ship was now slowing down gradually, and I had to hand over this report to the pilot. This would certainly be a very good journey. However, I wished the ship had five hundred tons of potatoes instead of fifteen hundred tons of explosives.</p>
<p>(The above section was mailed from Halifax Harbor. The following section was telegraphed from London after the convoy arrived.)</p>
<p>On the horizon, a wisp of faint smoke appeared. In the vast Atlantic Ocean, smoke meant a ship, but that ship could be friend or foe. The first mate held up his binoculars and watched carefully. The wisp of smoke gradually turned black, and sometimes the sea breeze blew, causing the horizon to rise and fall, and the smoke became fainter again. Later, we could see the ship.</p>

<h3>Eden Declares that any Threats to Thailand's Independence Would Lead to a Serious Situation, UK Has Expressed Concerns to Japan, Thailand also Deploys Troops to Defend its Territory</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that any actions that threaten Thailand's independence and integrity would be considered an event of immediate concern to the United Kingdom, regarding it as a threat to the security of Singapore. The British government has alerted Japan to recent press commentary about Thailand that resembles the prelude to Japan's demands for bases in Vietnam. The British Ambassador to Japan has pointed out to the Japanese Foreign Minister that if Japan takes such steps, the most serious situation between the United Kingdom and Japan will be inevitable.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 6th - The general public attaches great importance to the news that US Secretary of State Hull only met with the Thai Minister to the US after resuming his duties. They are now eagerly awaiting the results of this meeting. Local officials said they were unaware of any ongoing economic negotiations. Neutral observers especially call attention to the reported demands from both sides, saying that the Japanese side's first demand, the recognition of "Manchukuo" by Thailand, is definitely an economic demand, so military demands will undoubtedly follow.</p>
<p>Thailand Watches the Situation Develop</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 6th – According to qualified observers, Thailand is currently watching the development of the situation with vigilance. The continued seriousness of the situation between Thailand and Japan is undoubtedly true, but the tension has now slightly eased. At the same time, Thailand and [missing information] can be seen in the large-character publication in the newspapers of the British message of the Far East crisis. Although the areas of Cambodia recently received by Thailand, according to the Thai-Vietnamese agreement, have provisions for non-fortification, Thai troops have received considerable equipment for defense. According to official announcements, Thailand's Eastern Route Army's tank force has been established in Battambang, and batches of mechanized units and a large number of police have also been distributed in the newly occupied areas. According to the provisions of the Tokyo Treaty, these troops will be allowed to stay for one month. According to the Silikron newspaper, a large number of Japanese troops are currently concentrating along the Great Lake bordering Cambodia and Thailand, and plans to build naval and air bases are underway.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bangkok, 6th – It was officially announced here last night that Battambang (transliteration) in Cambodia has been designated as the headquarters of the Tank Force of the Thai Eastern Route Army. This location is only 50 kilometers away from the current border between Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 6th - Senior Thai authorities today absolutely deny the claim that British warships and the British warship HMS Walsbite appeared in the Gulf of Thailand (Siam Bay).</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Vietnam Continue to Move Towards the Thai Border, Hanoi Authorities Solemnly Deny that Japan has Made Demands on Guangzhou Bay</h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 6th – A Japanese patrol ship and five destroyers are docked in the Saigon River. Every day, several Japanese cargo ships pass by their side and head upstream. At the same time, truck convoys continue to depart for the Thai border. Many trucks have been driving out since Saturday. Each convoy has six or seven Harley-Davidson motorcycles, sixty Chevrolet and Ford trucks. Half of the trucks carry 25 soldiers each, while the rest carry a few soldiers and some war equipment, including field guns and mortars. There are also several trucks carrying long-barreled guns, which can be used for various purposes, and their height can be used to resist aircraft, but heavy guns have not been seen. Warehouses and shipyards here are filled with Japanese troops from Tokyo, Vietnam. Other Japanese troops come from Guangzhou, and some of them participated in the battle in Nanning. The houses around the big square in Phnom Penh are now said to have been requisitioned by the Japanese army. The current rainy season will now hinder the Japanese military's operations. It is expected that the Japanese military will strive to consolidate its bases and arrange its military supplies within a few weeks. Japanese trucks are now using the gasoline they have brought in themselves. Saigon is still peaceful, but American businesses are now drastically reducing the number of foreign employees.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Hanoi, 6th – Rumors that Japan has made certain demands on France for Guangzhou Bay have been solemnly denied by the authorities here, who said that this rumor is being spread for a purpose.</p>
<h3>Thailand Actually Announces Recognition of "Manchukuo"</h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 6th – Yesterday, the Thai government announced its recognition of "Manchukuo." At the same time, the Minister of Finance announced that three Thai banks would invest ten million Thai baht in the Yokohama Specie Bank to promote Thai-Japanese trade. Recently, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister simultaneously met with the British Ambassador.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 6th – Today's Asahi Shimbun carried a report from Bangkok that the British Minister to Thailand had protested to the Thai government because Thailand recognized "Manchukuo."</p>
<h3>Japanese Young Parliamentarians Plan to Form a New Group</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th – According to the Miyako Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun, young members of parliament are now uniting to form a new political group, aiming to put the power of parliament on the basis of the war on the one hand and break the current situation of parliament on the other. This move was initiated by Hatoyama, a former member of the Seiyukai and former Minister of Education in the Saito Cabinet in 1932. Young members of various political parties are responding enthusiastically. The two newspapers predict that if members of the disbanded political parties gather together, various political factions that previously leaned towards the totalitarian party platform will form a new political group.</p>
<h3>Indian Manganese Ore Banned from Export to Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th – Japanese sources said that according to a telegram received by Nippon Yusen Kaisha yesterday, the Indian government has announced a ban on the export of manganese ore to Japan from August 1st.

<h3>US Military Service Extension Act Passed by the Senate, Compromise Rejected</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 6th – The Senate unanimously passed the final form of the bill authorizing the extension of military service for personnel over 28 years of age. This bill has been sent to the White House for signature. The bill allows conscripts and National Guard members currently serving, who are over 28 years of age, to resign if their retirement does not conflict with the national interest.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 6th – The Senate yesterday voted 52 to 27 against the proposal by Republican Senator Taft of Ohio to limit the term of service for army conscripts to 18 months. This vote is sufficient to demonstrate the sentiment of the administration's military service extension bill, and it is expected that the plan to extend future conscripted military service from the current 12 months to two and a half years will be approved.</p>
<h3>Act Granting Wartime Powers to the President to Confiscate Private Property Passed by the House and Sent to the Senate</h3>

<h3>American Citizens in Shanghai Encounter Difficulties from Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 6th – New York Democratic Congressman Dickstein declared in the House of Representatives yesterday that American citizens in Shanghai are often troubled and inconvenienced by the Japanese authorities. It is reported that he has received a telegram from his constituents, who are running legitimate businesses in Shanghai and hold American passports and Japanese permits, but the Japanese are allowing them to return home by ship. He also said, "We are very lenient with the Japanese here. I personally believe that we are too accommodating to the Japanese."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Purchases Opium</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – It was revealed today that the Hong Kong government, in view of the shortage of smuggled opium and the inability to meet the needs of ordinary opium addicts, has had to purchase opium to meet their needs. The reason for the opium shortage here is that the Sino-Japanese war is taking place in South China, making it impossible to smuggle opium into Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong government has had to purchase HK$400,000 worth of raw opium to supply the addicts. This is the first decision by the government to purchase opium since 1937. It has recently purchased 135 boxes of this opium from Singapore. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing: A Mountain City. A Visit by Luce and His Wife, Publishing Titans (3)</h3>
<p>At the embassy on the hilltop, Ambassador Johnson and the entire embassy staff welcomed us. We entered the house and looked out across the river at Chongqing. The sun was high in the sky, the weather was hot, and the scene seemed very peaceful. We could see no one and hear nothing. The boats were all tied to the shore, and the air was still. The ambassador was talking about the last air raid, how a certain part over there – "Look, that large empty space on the hillside" – was burned to the ground by incendiary bombs. The major took out his watch, looked up at the dazzling sky, and listened carefully. May 3rd and 4th, 1939, the most unforgettable days – the first major air raids. At least five thousand people died, and thousands more were injured. And many more thousands lost their lives last year and the year before. But now the residents of Chongqing know how to deal with it. They simply leave the city, close their shops, hide their valuables, and take refuge in the air-raid shelters. Now no more than a hundred people die – unless there is a major fire, no one will lose their life.</p>
<p>"The planes are coming over there!" I could not hear anything, and could not see anything in the dazzling sky. Then came a sound "Long, hoong long, hoong long, hoong long". A black smoke about a mile long rose from behind the mountain. The major pointed to the sky, and I saw the silver planes shining in the sunlight. There were six, twelve, yes, quite a few planes. The sound of "Hoong Long--Hoong Long" disappeared after a minute--this black smoke, black smoke with dust, rose to the sky, spread out, and then it became quiet. We waited, took a few photos, asked a few questions, and listened to them tell stories about the three years of bombing history.</p>
<p>We returned to the city, the most important thing being to find out how many were injured. On the road, we saw a hut or shop that was broken everywhere. People were busy picking through the piles of broken bricks, stacking them into piles, and salvaging damaged furniture. The whole street was bustling again, even busier than before. The air raid team, whom we had seen leaving for work three hours ago, was now marching back through the crowded streets. We walked to an open space at the Methodist Church, right in the center of this large mine site, which had been bombed into a large hole. The surrounding fifty yards was a pile of newly turned soil.</p>
<p>Sir Kerr, as everyone knows, is not only the most humorous foreigner in China, but, in the opinion of many, also one of the most capable diplomats. Kerr is a Scottish nobleman who adheres to liberalism. His residence is like a tea pavilion. The house was originally built for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, but was later rented to Sir Kerr, with the rent going to support the orphans of soldiers. Sir Kerr showed me the places around his residence that had been damaged by the bombs, where the plaster had fallen off. Then we sat down and talked for two hours about the political situation in China.</p>
<p>That night, we had dinner with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Wang was a well-known scholar who had attended the Hague Tribunal and was about to retire from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Also present that evening were the young Mayor of Chongqing and his wife, who was good at telling stories. The Mayor's wife can be called a standard Chinese beauty, petite and exquisite, with a smooth, oval face. Her cherry-red mouth could speak cleverly and ingeniously.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>There would be bombing tomorrow. The big one was at half past nine. Weidner was with us organizing telegrams, when a servant ran in quietly and said, "The first ball." The Japanese planes had just left Hankou. The servant was busy packing up various things, and we prepared to go to the air-raid shelter set up by the Central Bank at the other end of the city. There was a long flight of stone steps from the road to the bank and to the air-raid shelter behind the bank. About thirty or forty people had gathered on the steps—you had to have a pass to enter this special air-raid shelter. A very beautiful American was sitting on the lower steps, wearing a pair of gray shorts. This person's name was William Hunt, and he was the authoritative representative for promoting various American products in China.</p>
<p>The sun gradually rose, and finally, the second emergency alarm sounded, and we all left the steps, passed through several guards in the passage, and ran into the basement. The one we reached was a very large basement, and although it was crowded, it was still quite comfortable. Bank employees and their families were taking refuge here. Part of it was really given to us and the Hunt Company. There was half an hour of chatting, guessing where the nearest bomb would fall… then suddenly the whole cave became quiet. Of course, those with sharp hearing could distinguish the sound of the Japanese planes bombing. Boom—splatter—boom—splatter. These terrible noises lasted for half a minute, and then everything disappeared. Half an hour later, we had run out and saw the light of day again.</p>
<p>As we ran out of the stone steps of the air-raid shelter and onto the road, we happened to meet Mayor Wu, who was coming out to check the damage. He only stopped for a moment, gave a greeting, and ran. We had a great meeting that day—a tea party with Madame Chiang, and perhaps the Generalissimo as well. Madame Chiang has a stimulating personality, which no magical description of her can fully convey. When Madame Chiang walked into her large, dimly lit reception room, she spoke to me in English that was one hundred percent fluent; she spoke so fast that I had never heard anyone speak like that before. In the middle of the conversation, a door opened and a person ran into the room without being noticed. After a while the conversation continued. Then you suddenly felt that there was no one else in the room except the person who had just quietly run in. We all stood up. A slender, inviolable figure in gray clothes walked forward, and several clear greetings could be heard: "Good... good..." Madame Chiang introduced us. Her voice now carried a joyful and hospitable expression, and a hint of a smile appeared on her thin lips: "Good...good...good..." He walked over and stood in front of his chair. "Good... good..." He motioned for us to sit down.</p>
<p>He asked about our journey, and thanked us for our special visit. We made a brief reply, and Madame Chiang explained to him the things that were of interest to him. We had a meal—delicate and simple food, which was exactly the kind of food I liked to eat most in China. I showed him a photo album, which contained photos of him and Madame Chiang, as well as many photos of other important government officials. He looked at the photos of himself and Madame Chiang with childlike joy. He looked at each photo very quickly, but he skipped over photos of less important government officials... An hour later, we knew we had met two people, a man and a woman, who will be remembered by people in countless centuries after they are gone, among the millions of people alive today.</p>
<p>During the three days in Chongqing, it became clear that it would be impossible to go to the front line in the shortest possible time. I had Mr. Dong Xianguang, the translator, convey to the Generalissimo that I wanted to see his troops. For half an hour, I only felt his gaze piercing. Now, after hearing this request, he nodded his head. Then he paused for a moment, I guess he was estimating the location of every plane in China. As we stepped out of the house, the good Mr. Dong's face was full of suspicion.</p>

<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Reports on International Situation in the House of Commons, Firmly Resolves to Effectively Aid the Soviet Union in its Resistance War, and Closely Monitors Developments in the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - Lord Privy Seal Attlee, when initiating the debate on the war situation in the House of Commons today, spoke of the great struggle of the Soviet people and army. He said, "Today, all eyes are turned to the great war from the White Sea to the Black Sea. The Soviet people and army are now engaged in a great battle in this vast theater of war (cheers) to resist the German army and the hangers-on of the Nazi regime. Anyone who attempts to predict the outcome of the war at this time is extremely foolish. The failure of the German General Staff's plan to achieve rapid gains is already very evident. As early as July 13th, the Germans were already claiming that the Stalin Line had been breached, but this has now been proven untrue. Murmansk, at the northern end, is still in Soviet hands. Soviet resistance is extremely strong. The enemy still needs a long journey to reach the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk. The German offensive on Leningrad from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea has recently made no real progress. Fierce battles are still raging around Smolensk. The path to Moscow seems far from open. As for Kyiv, which the Germans claimed to have occupied three weeks ago, it remains a fortress in the Soviet defense line. The German communiqués have expressed amazement at the determination, courage, and combat power of the Soviet army (cheers). It is clear that the German side has suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. I dare say that everyone is thrilled by this glorious resistance of the Soviet Union. We are now doing our best to provide this ally with all possible assistance. A British military mission began working in Moscow six days after the German invasion. A Soviet mission is also carrying out its tasks in London at the same time. We are now taking urgent steps to supply the Soviet Union with the military materials and supplies it has requested. The activities of our fleet in Kirkennes and other places in the north demonstrate how closely we are in contact with the Soviet army," said Attlee. He also mentioned the strength of the British air force offensive and warned the nation not to be overly optimistic. He said that Hitler has now been forced to fight on two fronts. Although the invasion of Britain has only been repeatedly postponed, it is by no means abandoned. The troops stationed in Britain have been ordered to prepare to the highest degree. The domestic defense forces are now fully equipped and ready. Their strength has greatly increased compared to a year ago. If the German army invades by sea and air, it will be destroyed immediately. Attlee finally mentioned the Far East, saying that the independent and parallel measures taken by Britain and the United States against Japan demonstrate the common interests of the two countries. Although the Japanese government protested that its motives were purely defensive, the British government is now maintaining the highest degree of vigilance, especially because the rhetoric of Japanese newspapers is inconsistent with its official assurances. There is evidence to show that Japan is shifting its attention to Thailand, a situation similar to that before the invasion of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 6th - The evening paper quoted a London dispatch as saying that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky had indicated to the British side that the Soviet Union would soon announce freedom of religion.</p>
<h3>First Batch of American Munitions Shipped to the Soviet Union by Sea, Fulfilling Promise of Material Assistance, Expected that Japan Will Not Interfere</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 6th - It was announced here today that the United States has shipped the first batch of munitions to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 6th - Sources in the capital revealed last night that the United States has fulfilled its promise to assist the Soviet Union and has shipped the first batch of military supplies to the Soviet Union. The first batch of goods includes military equipment and industrial machinery. The machinery was ordered before the German-Soviet war. Although Japanese newspapers have hinted that the U.S.'s shipping military supplies to the Soviet Union is an unfriendly act towards Japan, which is aligned with the Axis powers, and will increase tensions in U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. officials are skeptical that Japan will interfere with this move by the U.S. Well-informed sources do not attach much importance to Japan's threats, as they believe that Japan would not take this huge risk and further worsen U.S.-Japan relations. Furthermore, there is still a neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. If Japan were to do so, would it not damage relations between Japan and the U.S.?</p>
<h3>U.S. Orders Large Number of Aircraft from Canada, Will be Shipped to China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands East Indies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - According to a message from Ottawa, the United States is now purchasing 500 Whirlwind aircraft from Canada. It is reported that these aircraft will be shipped to China, the Netherlands East Indies, and possibly the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Officials Deny Sino-Soviet Conference Rumors</h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 6th - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky yesterday referred to the Japanese rumors that a Sino-Soviet military conference was being held in Chita, Siberia, and said that this news was "a completely baseless fabrication by imaginative newspapers."</p>
<h3>Amidst Tense Soviet-Japanese Relations, Toyota Meets with Soviet Ambassador, Probably to Explain Attitude towards Neutrality Treaty, Amendment of Commercial Treaty May Also Be Discussed</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - After Foreign Minister Toyota took office, he declared to the ambassadors of the Axis powers Japan's adherence to the Tripartite Pact, but he had not yet expressed his attitude towards the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty to the Soviet Union. However, last night, he suddenly had his first meeting with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin, which lasted quite a long time. It is generally expected that this is related to Japan's attitude towards the Soviet-German war, which has never been discussed before. Since official spokesmen have repeatedly stated that Japanese-Soviet commercial relations will continue, it is generally believed that Toyota will declare to the Soviet ambassador that Japan will not change its neutral policy. This meeting is probably also related to the need to amend the commercial treaty. Japan has recently been doing its utmost to secure the supply of necessary goods at home and in East Asia. According to Japanese official sources, the Japanese government is now considering further restricting the private use of oil and trying to increase the domestic production of natural and artificial oil and metals. At the same time, there is panic about the supply and distribution of Japanese food. The ministers of agriculture and home affairs reported this matter to the Japanese Emperor yesterday, saying that the recent floods have damaged the harvest, and the situation is more serious than previously expected.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - Counselor Qochkov of the Soviet Embassy visited Sakamoto, Director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 2:20 p.m. today. He left after about an hour. The nature of the talks has not been disclosed.</p>
<h3>Vichy Government Issues Statement, Responding to Welles' Criticism</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - The Pétain government issued a statement yesterday in response to the criticism of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles. The statement said, "Welles expressed doubts about the ability of the French Empire to resist attacks. In fact, the heroic resistance of the French army against the British aggression in Syria can certainly be regarded as a sufficient answer." Regarding Welles' statement that the U.S.'s attitude towards Vichy will depend on how France defends its empire, the Vichy statement said, "The Syrian and Vietnamese issues cannot be compared. Syria was invaded, while Vietnam was not. Moreover, Vietnam is geographically and politically in a special position because it is far from France, so Vietnam cannot wait for events that could change the balance of power in the Far East."</p>

<p>Educational News - Director Yu Junxian of the Overseas Chinese Education Department to Inspect Overseas Chinese Education in the Philippines, Publishes Guidelines for Improving Overseas Chinese Education Before Departure</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) Yu Junxian, Director of the Education Department of the Central Overseas Affairs Commission, came to Hong Kong to inspect overseas Chinese education. He completed his work and left Hong Kong on the morning of the 30th of last month at 9:30 a.m. on the Philippine Clipper to Manila, and will travel to various places in Southeast Asia to continue his inspection. Accompanying him is Yu's top student, Jiang Zhijian, who recently graduated from the Overseas Chinese Education Teacher Training Class and was assigned to work in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary - Yu said that the Overseas Affairs Commission has been very active in improving overseas Chinese affairs in recent years, and pays special attention to the development of overseas Chinese education. During the recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Chairman Chen put forward a very detailed plan, which was approved by the meeting and has now been implemented. However, before implementation, it is necessary to have a real understanding of the current state of overseas Chinese education. He was ordered to inspect and investigate. His impressions in Hong Kong were very good. In the future, he will strengthen contacts in order to gradually improve. After Yu arrives in the Philippines, he will stay for a week, then go to Singapore, and then to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It was originally planned to go to Australia, but due to the current turbulent situation in the South Pacific, whether it will be possible to go there will be decided after arriving in Singapore. On the return journey, he will continue to inspect Burma and India before returning to China. The length of the trip is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Popularizing Overseas Chinese Education - The main purpose of the Overseas Affairs Commission's plan to improve overseas Chinese education is to popularize overseas Chinese education. According to current estimates, there are 700,000 to 800,000 overseas Chinese students in Southeast Asia. Recent surveys show that less than 300,000 children are enrolled in schools. Therefore, in order to ensure that all overseas Chinese students have the opportunity to enroll in schools, it is necessary to increase the number of overseas Chinese schools. This depends on the enthusiasm and scholarship of overseas Chinese organizations and is unlikely to be successful in the short term. Currently, it is planned to expand existing overseas Chinese schools in the hope of doubling the number of students enrolled. The rest will be gradually promoted. The training of teachers should also be prepared early. The methods to be carried out include lecturing and training old teachers, and cultivating new teachers. For the former, the classes will be transferred for training in stages, and the latter will be promoted in various ways. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education is requested to order each normal school to designate 50 places for cultivating overseas Chinese education talents. On the other hand, overseas Chinese teacher schools will be established in Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The one in Fujian province will open this summer with a funding of 200,000 yuan. The one in Guangdong province will be established next year. The teacher training class run by the Overseas Affairs Commission has 30 graduates this year, who will be assigned to serve in various places. The Overseas Affairs Commission's total education funding for this year is 1.2 million yuan. In addition, two overseas Chinese middle schools will be established for the children of returned overseas Chinese to enroll in, with an annual funding of 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Province Prepares to Select Students for Study in the United States</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Student Wins American Art Competition</h3>
<p>(New York Dispatch) It was announced here that the $1,000 first prize in the American magazine Youth Open Art Competition was won by Gong (Frdd Gong), an 18-year-old overseas Chinese student in the first year of Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. Gong's work was the best among the 57,000 entrants nationwide. It depicts the efforts of the people of the Northwest to develop land resources, including the arrival of the first settlers in covered wagons less than a century ago, to today's modern mining cities, dams, and highways. Before returning home to Oregon, this overseas Chinese youth will draw leaflets for the United Aid to China Movement. Mr. Lu Gouren and Mr. Ma Pengnian, wealthy merchants in maritime pearls, have recently admired Mr. Ma Shoubai of Tongchang Jewelry Store for his righteous act of organizing scholarship loans, and have therefore saved on entertainment expenses to organize talent cultivation scholarship loans, tentatively for 10 high school students, regardless of gender. The method is as follows: From now on, those who have an application form, attach a transcript of grades from the last semester and a two-and-a-half-inch half-length photo, and whose academic performance must be within the top eight in the school, can send a letter to Mr. Li Jiean, Showzhou Bookstore, 33 Seymour Road, for collection. The deadline is the 15th of this month. On the 17th at 2 p.m., an interview will be held at the Jiangdong Middle School on Foch Road, Chongqing Road. If successful, a letter will be sent for loan negotiation. If unsuccessful, certificates can be collected from the submission address from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Senior Nurse School News from the First Hospital of the Relief Association</h3>
<p>The First Hospital of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to promote nurse education, cultivate noble character in women, and serve the people, opened a Senior Nurse Vocational School two years ago, appointing Ms. Wu Zheying as the principal. Wu graduated from the Changci Hao Budong's Nurse School in the United States. After returning to China, she served as the head nurse of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the principal of the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital Nurse School, and the president of the Chinese Nurses Association, as well as the advisor to the International Red Cross in China. She is a pioneer in China's nursing field. Under the guidance of Principal Wu, the school is managed seriously and has achieved remarkable results. It has been registered with the Education Bureau and the Chinese Nurses Association. This year, a class of students can participate in the joint examination. The school is affiliated with the First Hospital of the Refugee Relief Association. Because it contains the word "refugee," many outsiders initially had misunderstandings. Therefore, the students recruited in the first session were of uneven levels. However, the principal of the school is highly respected, and the teachers are mostly specialized scholars. They are completely dedicated to sacrificing their services and do not count their remuneration as their career. After the outside world recognized the school, the second and third enrollments, as well as the recent enrollments, were mostly students who had graduated from junior high school, or had equivalent academic qualifications, and students with high school levels, who came to take the exams, which have met the educational standards. According to Principal Wu, the status of nurses in medical affairs is extremely important, because the time that doctors spend diagnosing and treating patients every day is far less than the time that nurses spend taking care of patients. Nurses are the right-hand men of doctors. This kind of life-saving work requires a noble character, considerable knowledge, and a spirit of enthusiastic service. Therefore, the standards for training students must be raised. According to the current situation of the hospital, there are 300 patients. Calculating that one person cares for five beds, theoretically 120 nurses can be trained. With students兼实习, it is more economical than hiring nurses from outside. However, due to the limited school buildings, not many can be accommodated. At present, in addition to the 35 students in classes A, B, and C, it is heard that there are many applicants for this year's enrollment (the exam is from August 2nd to 9th), but because it is planned to recruit 30 more people, it is feared that it will be difficult to admit more.</p>
<h3>Going to a Higher School · Taking an Entrance Exam · Self-Study Essential Composition Book for Middle School</h3>
<p>Chinese is a major subject in middle school, and composition is the writing technique in the Chinese subject, which should be emphasized even more. Elementary school graduates and high school students, whether they are taking entrance exams to go to a higher school, or self-studying during the summer vacation, should study composition carefully. The two major books "National Modern High School Composition Essence" and "National Modern Junior High School Composition," compiled and evaluated by Chinese experts Hu Puan and Tai Shuangqiu, are the only practical books for studying composition. The book collects excellent student representative works from over 4,000 middle schools across the country and is edited into eleven major categories, including narrative, explanation, argumentation, academic, postscript, description, essays, biographies, applications, poetry, and translation. The content is rich and easy to imitate. By studying the works of others, one can improve one's own thinking and writing skills, and composition difficulties can be overcome. Everyone who has read it praises it. Each book is in four thick volumes, with over 1,200 pages, originally priced at ten yuan, but now during the summer vacation, there is a special price of six yuan and eighty cents for students. The book is published by Quanfen Bookstore, 392 Laoishenfu Road, Shanghai. The storefront is at 277 Simalu Road. Other bookstores such as Xifei, Jiankang, Dongxin, and Penglai also sell it on consignment.</p>

<h3>Summer Basketball Invitational League Full Schedule Announced Yesterday The Final Four Will Begin Competing Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>The 1941 Shanghai Summer Basketball Invitational League, which has invited the four major powerhouses of the city, including All Black, Hushing, Blue White, and Qianghua, to participate in the competition, is a single-round robin tournament to compete for this year's Shanghai basketball supremacy, and is truly a grand summer basketball event. It was originally scheduled to open this week, but because the city's disaster relief center is hosting a charity basketball and volleyball event this Saturday, it has been postponed to next Wednesday (13th). The second match is scheduled for next Saturday (16th), and the final match is scheduled for the 20th of this month (Wednesday). If it rains, it will be postponed for one day. The locations for the three matches are all planned to be held at the Guoqiang Middle School court on Carter Road. The full schedule was announced yesterday, including the opening matches of Blue White vs. All Black and Hushing vs. Qianghua, which are even more exciting programs than have been seen since the YMCA. Although the teams participating in the league are the same as the teams participating in the charity match that opens this week, the different round-robin and elimination systems are different paths to different goals. The final four lineups and the date of advance ticket sales will be disclosed in succession within days. The full schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Chess Cloth Ping Pong Club - Does Not Participate in Senior Cup, Does Not Approve of Using Soft Ball Competition</h3>
<p>The Chess Cloth Ping Pong Club held a meeting at 8 p.m. the other night at the Tongfu Silk Shop on Tianjin Road to discuss participating in the Invitational Senior Cup League. Over a dozen people attended the meeting, including Chairman Chen Linsheng, Chen Tianjue, members Chuan Guiqing, Cao Junbo, and team leader Cheng Shuming. The meeting was chaired by Chen Linsheng. First, Cheng Shuming reported on the recent status of the team, and then the matter of participating in the Senior Cup was discussed. It was generally believed that the competition still used soft balls, which was inconsistent with the club's year-long efforts to promote the use of hard ball competition. Moreover, the world's ping pong community has long used hard balls for competition, so the ping pong level has improved a lot. Soft balls were eliminated four or five years ago. To uphold Chairman Chen's ambition to promote hard balls, it was unanimously decided not to participate in the competition. As for the club's individual ball cup tournament, it is currently actively preparing and collecting prizes, and will be held in a spacious hall in the autumn. At that time, there will also be Chinese and Western ping pong masters, both male and female, participating in the performance. All competitions will use hard balls.</p>

<h3>Finance The Keen Interest of Chinese Merchants: USD $600,000 Invested in US Currency</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, posted exchange rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for the British and American exchange rates continued to tighten sharply, but Chinese speculators continued to exert great effort to push the rates higher. Despite signs that British and American commercial firms were willing to offer currency, a coal settlement by Yi Tai Hing required funds, and HSBC only supplied USD $1,000 at a rate of $5.125. The small counter was reduced to $5.0625. The zeal of Chinese merchants to push rates higher only increased. Although Hong Kong Electric released some British currency, the interest of Ewo and the Chinese banks to absorb it was positive, leading to a simultaneous tightening of both exchange rates until the midday close. Trading was quite active during the morning session. Chinese speculators purchased US dollars to the amount of 5-600,000. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>More Coal Settlements</p>
<p>Since morning, the cable news from the silver market showed a large and long increase. The exchange rate between the US and India remained flat, while the pound's exchange rate against Shanghai weakened by 0.03125. Other rates remained unchanged. The central posted exchange rates remained the same. The opening price in the domestic market (according to Reuters) for the British pound was 3 shillings and 0.078125 pence. Chinese speculators were buying US dollars for delivery in August and September, with a few at a price of $5.15625, but later only at $5.125. The momentum had already softened. HSBC's posted exchange rate remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax increased by 25, accounting for a slight percentage of 24.50%. It was heard that Hong Kong Electric released British pounds for August delivery at a rate of 3 shillings and 0.09375 pence. After being absorbed by Ewo and the Chinese banks, there were reports of coal settlements. HSBC sold August currency at a rate of $5.125, but the amount was extremely small. Speculators pushed the rate up to only $5.09375. The market momentum tightened somewhat at midday. Hong Kong Electric offered British pounds for August at 3 shillings and 0.0625 pence, so the closing prices for spot and September delivery were only 3 shillings and 0.046875 pence, and $5.09375 for US dollars. This was $0.015625 tighter than the previous day's closing price for US dollars, and $0.03125 tighter for US currency.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the foreign exchange market opened with rates, but no trading volume. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai rose independently by five dollars to $480. The remainder remained unchanged. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Exchange Rate Slightly Tightens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 6th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, HSBC opened flat. The exchange rate for London telegraphic transfers tightened by 0.0625 to 3.5 pence. The exchange rates for New York telegraphic transfers and Shanghai currency remained unchanged. The unofficial market for "Joint Notes" rose by 25 cents to $55.</p>
<h3>Many Turning Bullish: The Gold Market Thrives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial gold market rose sharply, with prices soaring beyond the $6,800 mark. All parties shared a unanimous bullish sentiment, entirely due to the foreign exchange market tightening amid speculative buying. The Shanghai West-side Gang turned bullish and invested heavily, while gold shops and securities firms also competed fiercely to invest. The price rose from $6,758 to reach the floor price. The gains expanded at noon, rising to $6,820, and ultimately continued to surge by $60. The half-day trading volume was 6-70,000 taels. There was no trading on Wednesday afternoon. The cash price increase slowed, but unprecedented high prices emerged one after another. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of $8,560. Cheng Kee spent Yuan to buy 30 taels, and Tian Yuan spent 20 taels at a new high price of $8,570. Ming Feng spent Yuan to buy 40 taels, and Cheng Kee spent Hong Qing Yong to buy 30 taels for $8,560, an increase of another $60. Jewelry gold also rose by $5, reaching $875.</p>
<p>Futures Rise by Another $60</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM for $6,770, $12 higher than the previous day's closing price. At that time, due to Ho Shing's aggressive selling during the buying frenzy, it rose to $6,775, and then retreated to $6,758. With US dollars difficult to settle at $5.15625, Taifeng, Gonghe, Tong Kang Yong, and Defu came in strongly to invest, surging $32 to reach $6,790. Xin Feng Yong, Cheng Kee, and Yi Yuan released currency, pushing it down to $6,760. It then stabilized for a long time until around 11:00 AM. The tightening of the foreign exchange market intensified the buying frenzy again. Heng Kee, Yi Feng, Yi Da, Dingsheng Retail Investors, and others poured in, and the Shanghai West-side Gang searched for currency. The price suddenly rose by $55, reaching $6,815, as Xiang Xing Yong and Li Tai sold. It retreated to $6,790. However, as the foreign exchange rate remained tight, Yi Yuan, Xiang He, He Shing, Chi Da and others aggressively invested, surging $30 to reach $6,810. Defu and Taifeng sold, pushing it back to $6,805. The midday close was again raised to $6,818. After closing, Yi Yuan continued to release currency, falling back to $6,812. The final price rose to $6,820. The difference during the first half of the day was $62. The price ultimately continued to rise by $6. Based on the August US dollar settlement price of $5.09375, the gold price was $6,836.8, a premium of $18.8. There was no market or price outside the exchange on Wednesday afternoon. The selling price at cash gold shops was $8,600, with a deduction of $200 for buying back. There was no price or market for cash margins.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Reaches a Daily High</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold at gold shops, per tael, was initially posted by Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng at $870. It rose by $5 at 11:00 AM to $875, with a deduction of $40 for buying back.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollars Exceed Five Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw gold futures rise, but the cash price remained stable, so British and American gold pounds also stabilized. British currency notes rebounded by one dollar. American currency notes opened at $1,941 and rose to $47 before suddenly falling back to $39. Shun Yuan, United Xie Tai, Yong Xiang Yuan, and Yong and others took the opportunity to buy cheaply, raising it to $60. The midday close was $1,959, up $21 from the previous day. The spot price was $19.55. Hong Kong currency notes showed a strong upward trend, rising to $5.05 in the evening market. Canadian currency notes also showed a strong trend. Japanese currency notes and Korean currency notes both trended firmer and higher. The former rose to $2.26, and the latter rose to $1.78.</p>
<h3>Securities: Due to the Timing of Bond Interest, Unified A Bonds Were Sold Considerably</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday initially weakened but then strengthened. The early weakness was due to long positions being liquidated, followed by short covering, resulting in strengthening. The trend was generally sideways, and future developments hold little hope. Long positions were gradually wavering. Currently, short covering transactions are still being used to provide support. Various public bonds continued to report strong prices. The A bond, however, bucked the trend and weakened. This was because those who held long positions were unwilling to wait for the lottery draw. Although the chances of winning the lottery with A bonds are high, the benefits obtained after winning are limited. The full amount can only be received after thirteen months. If the bonds are sold at 90% of market value after winning, the profits are even smaller. Moreover, whether one wins the lottery is still uncertain, so many people are selling A bonds and buying B bonds, considering it a speculative opportunity amidst other speculation. Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Yongchang, and Runli bought, while Yitai and Hongda sold. The midday close was weaker. In the afternoon, Yichang, Zhongfu, and Dingkang sold in, while Xinhua and Lianyi covered their positions. C bonds again broke through the $8 mark. Aside from the A bond, which fell by 25 cents, and the D bond, for which there was no trading, all other bonds were slightly better by 11 cents to 40 cents. Trading volume gradually decreased. The total daily turnover was only around 1.2 million. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>For stock transactions, 50 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of $28.25.</p>
<p>The public utilities stock market opened steady and closed weak, with some changes in between. Public bus stock initially saw aggressive buying, with the price rising from $18.60 to $20.00, but then reversed and fell by about one dollar.</p>
<h3>Coal: Shortage of Cooked Coal Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The cooked coal business has recently seen slight movement in sales due to a limited supply of coke. Meanwhile, the self-igniting coal merchants, seeing the popularity of bituminous coal and high costs, have reduced production, resulting in a significant shortage of spot goods on the market. Cooked coal merchants have no goods to sell and have to offer high prices to surrounding households to search for old orders to meet market demand. Therefore, there is a significant price difference, ranging from approximately $460 to $480. Most of the shops on this street are out of stock and have stopped selling, it is said.</p>
<h3>Different Views on Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Neither Up Nor Down</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains flat due to weak actual trading. As for Hong Kong, the supply of 32-count single yarn and 42-count yarn are both for local consumption in Hong Kong, so the trading is still good. However, due to continued obstructions in the transport of 20-count yarn into the mainland, there is little progress in purchasing, resulting in a sluggish market. Market sentiment is divided. Those who are bullish say the raw material prices have risen recently, and securities firms and gold shops are buying in the gold market. However, others in the industry say that sales are slow, inventories are sufficient, and the price of mixed yarns is increasingly cheap. 20-count Fairy Maiden yarn is only selling for $1,410, and 20-count Double Globe is selling for $1,385 to $90. By comparison, Double Horse is uniquely expensive, and the factories seem quite willing to sell. Therefore, they tend to sell when prices are high. With the two sides strongly disputing, the market is unable to rise and unable to fall. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was $1,582, and the low price was $1,566. The afternoon market was unusually loose, with few transactions. It initially traded at $1,572, falling to $70, and the final transaction was $1,574.</p>
<p>Double Horse Agricultural Opening: Although the bullish sentiment was high, the market atmosphere was ordinary. As prices were called higher, everyone wanted to sell. The opening price was $1,5177, and it soon rose to $1,582. Then, due to poor sales of 20-count yarn from guest customers, it fell back to $1,565. Before long, due to rising margins, some of the securities firms came back to push the price up, rising to $1,582. However, those in the industry who were hedging were very prevalent. By the time the market closed, it had fallen back to $1,574. The total trading volume for the half-day was 6,190 bales. The amounts bought by each side are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Industry Peers 6,000 Hong Kong 190 Total 6,190</p>
<p>The market conditions for Double Horse Agricultural Futures Yarn: At the morning opening, US cotton continued to trend downward, and bulls from gold shops and securities firms closed their positions. Except for a slight increase of half a dollar for September delivery, August delivery fell by three dollars, and September fell by three and a half dollars. After the opening, it was heard that the Double Horse factory's single yarn was still tight, and with gold prices continuing to rise, new buying and short covering were heavy. August delivery rose to $1,459, September delivery to $1,534, and October delivery to $1,542. After entering the market, due to a lack of progress in customer sales, the bulls turned to selling at high prices. August delivery fell slightly to $1,451, September delivery to $1,521, and October delivery to $1,533. There was a slight rebound at the end. August delivery was flat in the afternoon, September fell by two and a half dollars, and October fell by four and a half dollars. 700 bales were traded. Later, trading was sluggish, and prices all eased, falling by one to four dollars. The evening close showed that August delivery fell by four dollars from the previous day, September delivery fell by three and a half dollars, and October delivery fell by six dollars. The total daily trading volume was 9,590 bales, a decrease of 8,410 bales from the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high and low prices are recorded on the left (net quoted prices):</p>

<p>The cotton yarn situation is increasingly showing firmness with softness. The general consensus is that factory demand has been quiet for a long time, prices have not loosened at all, and transactions have decreased significantly. In addition, the overseas cotton market is also in a state of hesitation. As for the local cotton, cotton merchants unanimously expect it to rise, but consumers are pessimistic about the prospects for cotton yarn, creating an inverse relationship with cotton merchants. Therefore, it is difficult to find much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In other news, trading in foreign cotton orders in Shanghai is showing weakness due to falling US and Indian cotton prices. At the same time, due to the chaotic international situation and the looming Pacific crisis, the intention to purchase is reduced. In recent days, only spot trading for goods about to arrive in Shanghai has been somewhat active. Factories are cautiously engaging in direct orders from overseas.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to Washington political news unfavorable to bulls and weakness in New Orleans. Yesterday, the Secretary of the Treasury criticized Smith's bill to support cotton farmers. At the same time, the government's announcement that cotton loans must be lower than the current situation by two points caused panic. However, it then rose slightly due to some short covering. As a result, closing prices were lower than the previous day by 23 to 28 pounds each, depending on the quality.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to buying by speculators, but then fell slightly due to profit-taking by bulls and a weather report unfavorable to bulls. Yesterday's closing prices were up two to seven rupees each. The opening market today is forecast to fall by four to four and a half rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Bleached and Dyed Fabrics, Twill: Active Exports to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Factory Fabrics: Yesterday's market trend continued to be firm due to active exports to Southeast Asia from Hong Kong firms and Southeast Asian firms. There was a coordinated sentiment. Fine yarn and printed fabrics rose more due to increased raw material and processing costs. White fabrics rose slightly less. Lun Chang's Clore silk rose from a recent price of $47 to $49. Soil linen cloth and wool serge each rose about one dollar per bolt. White cloth, Fugui fine cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth were stable. Various brands rose by 25 cents to 50 cents per bolt due to the urgent need for dyeing factories. The street traded over one thousand bolts of each fabric. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian firms imported over 5,500 bolts of bleached and dyed fabrics and twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The situation continued to be expensive, but selling was slightly uneven. Futures for each month fell by about 15 cents per bolt on the exchange. Spot goods, leading fine cloth factory orders, also fell by 10 cents. The afternoon close was $52.65. However, mid-range and lower-end mixed-brand fine cloth and fine twill all reported price increases. This was because the demand for dyeing and sales on the street was constant, and the roots of hand goods were gradually tightening. Each bolt continued to rise by 35 cents each. Trading in colored Four Gentlemen serge was clearer, and prices were fairly stable. The evening close for new orders with new taxes was $1.73, and new orders with old taxes was $1.665. Both fell by 1 cent. Sales of wool flannel continued to decline. Guest firms had difficulty obtaining transportation permits, and transportation was obstructed, resulting in very little smooth business. This street’s actual sales were declining, and new additions were also sluggish. There were initial signs of interest in autumn and winter goods, but prices rose sharply due to the freezing of British and American exchange rates. After the rise in prices last week, back households also stopped importing. As a result, the trading in small-scale retail was very low, but the market price for bulk goods did not change due to sluggish sales. The market atmosphere remained strong and rising. Those holding goods were extremely reluctant to sell. Prices for various wool flannel goods all increased. Yinfeng 1470 French lining was sold for $1.60 per yard yesterday, black carbon lining was $4.25, Wensuchen ramie cloth was $2.50, Rentai Ape Man Tarzan raincoat silk was $6.50, Bobelin was $6, and lining wool was $2.50.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was once again in a sideways state, gradually rebounding. The early market was steady, the mid-market was weak, and the afternoon market rose again due to heavy buying. As a result, both futures and spot goods rose by one to two dollars compared to the previous market. Rumors favored the buyers in the early green rice market, and the market was relatively stable. However, as new japonica rice arrived one after another, and new early indica rice from the mainland was also sighted, both the Wuhu area and the Jiangbei new early indica rice had full harvests. Buyers of foreign rice from various ports in the Yangtze River in the mainland have stopped buying, and new indica rice will soon flood the market. Therefore, the market sentiment immediately followed the market price downward. Then, major customers absorbed at low prices, and demand in western Shanghai was even more enthusiastic. Furthermore, all kinds of rumors favored the buyers, and the market gradually rose. Xiaojiao Yinghua S was sold from $147 to $147.5, Number Two Siamese Rice from $137.5 to $138.8, and spot Xiaowen also rose from $117.8 to $120, which was a larger dollar or two higher than the previous market. 20,000 bags and 600 tons were traded. The closing prices for spot goods were as follows: Number One Saigon $131, $130; Middle Goods $129; Number Two $122, $120; Number Two Siamese White $19.5, $19; Tall $122; Min Dang $130; Middle Jue $124 to $121; Shangfo rice $127.8; Dutch white japonica $131.2; Bank Sample Xiaojiao White $19.5, Outer Stack $18.5; Tokyo Short Tip $128.8, $115; Broken Tip $92 to $89.9. In short, it went through periods of weakness and tightness, changing back and forth, and still increased by a dollar or so compared to the closing price of the previous market.</p>
<p>The thick and thin japonica domestic rice market continued to be weak due to increased supply. Sales on this street and in rural shops were weak, creating an imbalance between supply and demand. The market continued to fall. Early and late indica rice from Kainang Port were sold at $149, $147. Wuxi original package white japonica was $144. As for glutinous rice, the market was also sluggish, and although goods were scarce, it was still difficult to gain a foothold and continued to depreciate by one dollar. The opening price for Hong Kong white high was $124.5. Substandard yellow was $118.5. Glutinous tea was $113 to around $110. Domestic glutinous rice was uniquely short, as the inventory in the mainland was about to run out and the supply had been cut off for a long time. Limited spot goods were unwilling to be easily sold and remained at a small profit, still selling for $126.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Slightly Tighter</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was initially tight but then loosened, resulting in a slight improvement. Golden Dragon Flour was the most actively traded, initially at $31.70, then to $6.50 and $6.60. Qichang Stack goods were $31.45, and Fortress Flour was $33. A total of about 10,000 bags were traded. The remaining brands, such as Huayu and Clock Tower Flour, Taikoo and Roosevelt Stack goods (not weighed) were $33. Bank Stack goods (weighed) were in the range of $34.30 to $34.40. The market was sideways, without much rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans and Corn: Stockpilers Unload, Prices Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean sales were slightly weaker than before. Some stockpilers gradually unloaded at high prices, so the market trend turned weak. Prices fell slightly from the previous day. The whole market saw Hong Kong firms purchase 600 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of $51.50 to $51. 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans were inquired about on this street at a price of $50.05 to $50. 300 bags of Guide substandard soybeans were sold at a price of $48.50.</p>
<p>Stockpilers of corn were gradually selling off their inventories. Only Japanese firms were buying a little, so the trend lacked the power to rebound and was weak. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold, with prices falling by half a dollar to one dollar.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Both Dutch Red and White Sugar Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward due to international situation rumors that favored the bulls. The company's two-four coarse white sugar, for August 10 delivery, was initially $102.5, then fell slightly to $1.90, then rose to $2.80, a gain of 50 cents. August 20 was $102.8, rising to $3.80, a gain of 5 cents. Public association trading: Spot two-four coarse white, arriving in July, was $103.5 to $4.10, up 60 cents. June was $102.5 to $3.70, up 70 cents. May was $101.8 to $3.50, up one dollar. April was $1023, and March was $102.2 to $2.80, a gain of nearly one dollar. Dutch red NT mark was $86.5 to $87, up $2.20. Taikoo car white B mark was $130, unchanged. HX mark was $107.5 to $8, and the local factory's Number One ice was $135. Jingming ice was $137.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Ningbo Sea Blubber Freshly Offered</h3>
<p>The genuine Ningbo seafood, such as dried jellyfish, is extremely tight for old goods, while new goods have fallen back. New jellyfish skin is $90, and old goods are $140. New jellyfish heads are $70, and old goods are $130.</p>
<p>Dried squid has risen again. Zhoushan goods are $430, Ningbo goods are $270, and Yantai goods are $360.</p>
<p>Ningbo seedless light kelp has just begun to offer fresh. The opening price was $650. Old goods have long been scarce and there is no market.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Huaibei Vegetables Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>A batch of Huaibei vegetables officially arrived yesterday, totaling 81 packages. They have not yet been transferred to the stack. The large goods will be available today. Scattered Xuzhou vegetables have arrived. The market price has risen by another four to five dollars due to a shortage of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Wood Ear Rebounds</h3>
<p>Wood ear prices have recently rebounded by 20-30 dollars due to the scarcity of arrivals and slightly more active sales. The opening price for the Hekou ear was over $752. The airmail ear rose to $780. Ordinary ears were $732-40 to $720.</p>
<h3>Metals: Large Ma-kou Iron: Reluctant to Sell Off Easily</h3>
<p>The transaction of 14th and 26th Large Ma-kou Iron, saw a slight increase in searches by local lock factories, machinery factories, and yarn factories yesterday and the day before. Sentiment among industry peers remained firm and high. Yesterday's standard market price for 24th goods was 1,500 dollars per box, and 26th floral was 1,250 dollars per box, which was 70-80 to 100 dollars higher than the previous market. As this type of goods has been scarce for a long time and market inventory is very low, industry peers are more determined to hold on to the goods, and are very reluctant to easily sell even wholesale transactions of five or ten boxes.</p>

<h3>Regulations on the Supply of Foreign Exchange by the Four Banks promulgated by Order of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Chinese Banks Can Also Operate According to Law: Legitimate Merchants' Trade Will Be Safeguarded</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the US government has issued a total of 14 general communiqués announcing the freezing of funds from China and Japan, covering numbers 55 to 69 inclusive. Numbers 58 and 59 specifically define the procedures, authorizing 14 banks to handle import and export trade between China and any part of the UK, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, so that it can maintain a normal state and prevent any negative impact. In addition, the other communiqués divide the regions affected by the US government's freezing order into different areas, stipulating detailed procedures for each based on their individual circumstances, and designating several banks in each region to operate foreign exchange business under special license. The document accepted by the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, is a copy of Communiqué 14. The US consulate only delivered it to the Shanghai branches of the four banks yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Can All Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries made with the four banks revealed that import merchants who are engaged in importing goods that are not on the prohibited import list and are necessary for the country, must obtain approval from the Chinese government before being permitted to apply for foreign exchange purchases. The applicant must submit the names, quantities, prices, import, and marketing locations of the goods being purchased, together with supporting documents, requesting approval for the purchase of foreign exchange. For legitimate Chinese merchants in the Shanghai concession area who need foreign exchange to order foreign goods, in addition to purchasing foreign exchange at the black market exchange rate from four Allied banks such as Exchange National Bank and Citibank, they may also purchase it from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as Chinese banks engaged in foreign exchange business. However, the approval procedures for the supply of foreign exchange by the four banks and Chinese banks will be promulgated by order of the Ministry of Finance. It will be implemented after the order arrives in Shanghai. Therefore, the need for foreign exchange for all necessities can be obtained according to the regulations. The purpose is to safeguard the trade of legitimate merchants.</p>
<p>Preventing Abuse in the Hands of China</p>
<p>Economists say that the US government's implementation of the freezing of Japanese funds has a political significance that outweighs its economic significance. This is because before taking decisive action in the Pacific, it would be inconvenient for the US government to take sudden, sweeping action. Moreover, the situation in Shanghai is complex and the environment is special. Foreign firms in Shanghai have enormous rights and interests, and the US government is now reluctant to make unnecessary sacrifices. Furthermore, the Chinese financial authorities have repeatedly stated that they will maintain the black market in Shanghai. Since the US government's freezing of funds from China and Japan was made at the request of the Chinese government, then the legal applications for foreign exchange on the Shanghai market will naturally be supplied by the designated banks as much as possible. Therefore, it is expected that speculators in the city will use the names of certain import and export firms or companies to actively engage in foreign exchange speculation. However, the Chinese government authorities can maintain contact with the US government at any time, as needed, to stipulate special procedures and promulgate them to eliminate this illegal foreign exchange trading.</p>
<h3>Mobil Oil Tanker Still Detained</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Claims to be Investigating</p>
<p>According to the China Press, when a Japanese Navy spokesman met with reporters yesterday (the 5th), he was asked about the detention of the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Mobil Glory" by the Japanese authorities. The spokesman replied that the ship was currently detained pending the completion of certain investigations. The Japanese authorities are currently investigating as quickly as possible, and do not want to prolong the detention any further than absolutely necessary. As for the reason for the detention of the "Mobil Glory," it is said that the ship did not sail to a small port on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Jiangyin River, as stated in the customs clearance form, but sailed upstream 10 miles to Xingang, changing its destination without prior notice, resulting in its detention and escort back to Shanghai. The Japanese side is currently investigating its actions.</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Travel Ban in North China to be Lifted Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, regarding the recent ban by the Japanese side on British and American nationals traveling in North China, a spokesman for the Japanese embassy told reporters of the New China News Agency yesterday (the 5th) that this ban is expected to be lifted soon. He believes that the ban on travel is not retaliation for the British and American actions to freeze Japanese funds, but if it is indeed a retaliatory act, then the ban will not be lifted until the relationship between Japan, Britain, and the US has greatly improved. The spokesman also stated that in the future, foreigners may not be able to travel by train in North China, but foreigners from ports such as Yantai will be able to travel by ship in the future.</p>
<h3>New Beijing Steamer Delayed Arrival to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's North China route's new Beijing steamer, originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Tianjin via Yantai yesterday, did not arrive as of late evening. It is rumored that the steamer was delayed for several days in Yantai due to quarantine by the Japanese, thus delaying its arrival in Shanghai as well. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around tomorrow, and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Tianjin and Weihaiwei on the ninth. Jardine Matheson's Dongsheng steamer is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Tianjin and Yantai tomorrow (the eighth). As for the Shuntian steamer, which was supposed to be taken out of service on the North China line, passengers have already received ticket refunds, and cargo will also be unloaded within the day. As soon as unloading is complete, it will set sail south. The steamer is currently still docked at the Bund outside the French Concession's Rue du Consulat. The new Beijing steamer's wharf.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Transportation to Resume Service Today</h3>
<p>Salary Increase Issue Resolved Satisfactorily Last Night</p>
<p>According to reliable sources last night, the labor strike of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's transportation vehicles has been resolved through the efforts of the French Police Political Department. It is reported that in addition to a general increase of 19 yuan per person, a further bonus will be added, effective from the date of the company's announcement. All workers were satisfied. Around 8:00 PM last night, hundreds of workers lined up to work in the factory. After the company officials explained everything, about eighty coppersmiths and machine operators on the night shift first entered the factory to wipe down the vehicles and add machine oil. The drivers and ticket sellers were instructed to return home first and report to the factory at dawn this morning. They then dispersed. A work slowdown has been declared resolved. All tramcars, trolleybuses, and bus lines 21 and 22 will fully resume service this morning.</p>
<h3>Power Company to Further Reduce Electricity by 30%</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a meeting in the Council Chamber at 4:30 PM on the 5th to discuss the Shanghai Power Company's request to implement a 30% restriction on electricity and the issue of charging fees for exceeding the electricity limit. Considering the company's dwindling coal reserves, the committee deemed that the 30% restriction on electricity could be approved. As for the charging method for exceeding the limit, it was decided to charge three times the normal electricity rate.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Military Clash Dismissed as a Misunderstanding by Japan</h3>
<p>Claiming Minor Incidents Occur Occasionally</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that rumors of a clash between Soviet and Japanese troops near Manchuria about two weeks ago were confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, a spokesperson for the Japanese Army, at a press conference on the 5th. He stated that a small number of Soviet border guards crossed the border into Northeast China, and the two sides exchanged gunfire, with one Japanese soldier injured. Only four or five soldiers on each side fired their weapons, he said. Akiyama also stated that similar minor incidents had occurred in the border area for several years, but both the Soviet and Japanese sides considered them insignificant and did not deem it necessary to submit them to arbitration. The reason for the repeated small clashes is that there are many unclear demarcation points between the Soviet Union and the Manchurian frontier, leading to misunderstandings. Senior authorities are aware of this. Regarding the recent clash, there were many rumors in Shanghai, but in reality, this matter is not worth paying attention to, he said. When asked if the rumors of a widespread withdrawal of Japanese troops in China, leading to a major offensive by the Chinese army, could be believed, Akiyama replied that if the Japanese were truly withdrawing their troops, it would be a good opportunity for the Chinese army to launch a major offensive, but there is currently no sign of such an offensive.</p>
<h3>Passengers Should Cooperate Ethically to Eliminate the Bad Habit of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Should Insist on Receiving Tickets Equal to the Value Paid; Street Loafers Colluding with the Company Should be Strictly Investigated</p>
<p>The bad habit of public bus ticket sellers taking fares without issuing tickets has existed for a long time. Various parties have expressed concern about this. It is difficult to get the company to find a way to eliminate this bad habit or improve the treatment of ticket sellers. However, some passengers have the misguided mentality of not caring about the ticket sellers' bad habits. In fact, as the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep." If the company's income is insufficient for its budget, it will have to raise prices to make up for it. The ones who directly suffer losses are still the passengers. Knowing this, it can be seen that not caring about the ticket sellers' bad habits will inevitably lead to direct losses and indirectly encourage unethical behavior. As for the ticket sellers' low wages, if they are indeed insufficient to cover expenses, they can make reasonable demands to the company, which will surely receive the support of the public.</p>
<p>Ticket Seller Treatment is Not Meager</p>
<p>This newspaper recently received a letter from the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company stating that the company is deeply concerned about the situation and wishes to declare that it has made every effort to eliminate the bad habits of ticket sellers. The wages of ticket sellers cannot be said to be meager. It is also stipulated that ticket sellers with good behavior will receive special year-end allowances as encouragement. The company has a total of 879 ticket sellers on duty each day and 171 Chinese, British, Russian, and Korean ticket inspectors who board the buses at any time to check tickets, an average of one ticket inspector for every five ticket sellers.</p>
<p>Eagerly Awaiting Active Cooperation from Passengers</p>
<p>The company is now posting notices about fares on all buses. If passengers actively cooperate and insist on receiving tickets equal to the value they paid, then the ticket sellers will not be able to practice their bad habits. To give an example, when buying a pack of cigarettes or other items, everyone wants to get goods equal to the price paid. Shouldn't it be the same when riding a tram? Therefore, it is hoped that passengers will insist on receiving new tickets of equal value after paying the fare.</p>
<p>People with Good Behavior Also Exist</p>
<p>There is no shortage of ticket sellers with good behavior. If the public can actively cooperate, it will be possible to gradually eliminate bad habits. Furthermore, the company is also steadily cracking down on street loafers who collude with ticket sellers and notify them of the location of ticket inspectors. The company has dispatched personnel to patrol and arrest loafers who report information.</p>
<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Departed Shanghai for Bombay Yesterday</h3>

It is learned that Sir Sassoon departed Shanghai for Bombay, India last night. The date of his return to Shanghai is expected to be at the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Some Jews in Hongkou to Be Deported by the Japanese; Investigating So-Called "Undesirable Elements;" No Consideration Yet Given to How to Resettle Them</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a Japanese Navy spokesperson stated yesterday (the 5th) at a press conference that the Japanese authorities are seriously studying the possibility of deporting a certain percentage of Jewish refugees in areas under Japanese control. As a result of the study, some undesirable Jews may be deported. When this will be implemented is not yet known.</p>
<p>The internal motive for this move by the Japanese authorities, which is so-called stabilizing Hongkou's security, is related to stabilizing the lives of Jews north of the Suzhou Creek. Many Jews, mostly undesirable elements, seem to have infiltrated Hongkou without the necessary permits, affecting rent and food prices in the Jewish area. The Japanese authorities fear that Hongkou's security will be disturbed by this, so they plan to deport all undesirable elements to seek the welfare of general Jewish refugees. The deportation of undesirable elements will be carried out by the Jewish Community Association and will not be done by force.</p>
<p>General Jewish Community Greatly Shocked; When asked where the deported undesirable Jews will go after being deported from Hongkou, the spokesperson replied that the authorities have not yet considered this. Regarding this matter, Samuel Moiseiwitsch, editor of the Shanghai "Far Eastern Economic Review," a Jewish publication, has submitted a written protest to the Japanese authorities, opposing it. According to Moiseiwitsch, the news that the Japanese will deport "undesirable" Jewish refugees from Hongkou and Huishan districts has greatly shocked the Jewish community.</p>
<p>Japanese Actively Conducting Investigations; The Shanghai Jewish Chronicle had previously published a report foreshadowing this move by the Japanese. According to the report, the Japanese Marine Corps has invited some Jews, such as the newspaper's editor, Levin, to form a subcommittee to work with the Japanese Marine Corps to eliminate "undesirable elements." In addition to reporting to the Japanese on whether certain Jewish refugees are good, the subcommittee will also immediately deport Jews residing in Hongkou without permits after the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>Unilateral Actions Are Illegal; Moiseiwitsch continued, stating that he can declare on behalf of the 11,300 Jewish refugees in Hongkou that those who have formed a subcommittee at the request of the Japanese authorities do not have the qualifications to represent the entire Jewish community of Hongkou. Moreover, most of them do not reside in Hongkou and have not consulted with other Jewish leaders. Furthermore, the actions that the Japanese authorities intend to take are illegal because they have not consulted with the Municipal Council (Hongkou is part of the International Settlement) or any organization launched by the Jewish community in Shanghai. He believes that if this unilateral action is implemented, it will make the situation in Shanghai even more tense.</p>
<p>Approximately 4,000 People Without Permits; Furthermore, according to the English-language China Press, regarding the Japanese Navy spokesperson's statement that they intend to deport unregistered, undesirable Jews from Hongkou, the Municipal Council and the Jewish Refugee Committee are currently waiting for the Japanese authorities to take formal steps and therefore cannot take any countermeasures. It is widely believed that there are currently approximately 4,000 Jews living in Hongkou without Japanese permits, but many of them arrived in Shanghai before the Japanese implemented the permit system, and most of them cannot find accommodation elsewhere in the city. Therefore, if the Japanese authorities deport these Jews, it will only increase the difficulties in the city.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Season Approaching</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has announced that the hurricane season this year has also arrived. To ensure the safety of outgoing ships, starting today, if a hurricane threatens Shanghai, warning balls and red lights will continue to be hung on the Bund and on the roofs of the Customs House.</p>
<p>A new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean and is continuing to move rapidly northwest, posing a serious threat to the Chinese coast. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane is currently located at 21 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, moving northwest. The center of the storm is within 60 nautical miles. Also, starting today, the tidal surge in the Huangpu River will reach its maximum level. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's forecast, it will reach 12 feet 6 and a half inches, less than 4 inches from the Bund embankment.</p>
<h3>U.S. Policy on Evacuation Remains the Same, but the Situation Has Not Changed; Those with Important Missions May Still Reside; Clear Statement from Secretary of State Hull</h3>
<p>According to news reports from the day before yesterday (the 5th), U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently stated that the U.S. government had long ago urged Americans in the Far East to evacuate back to the country on ships passing through. Americans in Shanghai were somewhat surprised by this news, as Secretary of State Hull's statement seemed to indicate that there had been a change in the evacuation policy. The English-language China Press received numerous phone calls from Americans inquiring about this matter, so they telegraphed their editor, Gold, who is currently in the United States, last night to inquire about everything.</p>
<p>No Intention of a Complete Evacuation</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving the reply telegram, it was learned that the evacuation policy still only applies to "non-essential" Americans. Gold's telegram stated that he spoke with senior officials at the State Department, who assured him, "There has been no change to the U.S. evacuation policy announced last October and reiterated in February. Despite recent developments in the Far East, Washington has confirmed that the basic position remains unchanged. Therefore, the evacuation notice remains the same and still only applies to non-essential Americans, while Americans with necessary missions may still reside in the Far East." Hull's informal remarks yesterday were only intended to reiterate the previously issued evacuation notice, not to modify or expand it, he said. According to reports, after returning to the United States in May, Gold had several long talks with State Department officials, and based on the information he obtained, he wrote an article stating that the U.S. government did not intend to urge all Americans in the Far East to evacuate, but only wanted women, children, and men who did not believe it necessary to stay in the Far East to return to the United States. The U.S. government is very willing to "keep the flag flying," he said.</p>
<p>Americans in Japan Will Soon Return Home; Furthermore, according to U.S. official sources, the U.S. government now intends to dispatch ships to Japan to transport 654 Americans stranded in Japan back to the country. These expatriates were unable to return home because Japan suspended shipping to the United States. As for Americans residing in Shanghai, the original number was around 4,000 to 5,000. Since the evacuation began last autumn, about half of them have returned home one after another. As for the ships, a large number of the evacuating expatriates returned home on three ships specially dispatched by the U.S. government. Later, they successively boarded the Pacific Line ships of the United States Mail Steamship Company to leave Shanghai. The U.S. government once considered dispatching another special ship to the Far East to evacuate expatriates, but because ordinary shipping had not been interrupted due to the changes in the situation, and almost all non-essential expatriates had been evacuated, there was no need to dispatch another ship. Currently, only a small number of women and children are preparing to continue the evacuation.</p>

(10) Pay attention to the strictness of schools at all levels, as well as the leniency and strictness of the scoring system; the grading of schools in Shanghai at all levels varies widely, and some schools grade very leniently, so even if the grades listed on the report card are very good, they must be carefully considered. Regarding these ten points, applicants and their parents should be as sincere as possible and provide convenience to this newspaper's staff in their visits, so as not to disappoint the sincerity of the society and this newspaper in helping students.</p>
<p>The Son of a Maid</p>
<p>When I started my first scholarship visit, it was in the hottest weather of 98.5 degrees. Filled with excitement and new hopes, I thought to myself, I am going on an adventure to the metropolis of Shanghai, where the cost of living is so high, which will allow me to discover many inspiring lifestyles, many outstanding young people who feel that tuition fees are difficult to raise and are wandering and sad! My heart was unconsciously filled with sympathy and smiles because of the tension. The compassion that society has given us, we will give back to society.</p>
<p>That day, my destination was the extremely remote areas of the French Concession, including Route Tenant de la Tour, Avenue Petain, and Avenue de Ziccawei. According to the predetermined route, the first interviewee was at a certain address on Route Tenant de la Tour. According to the application form, it was just a mother and son, with the occupation of servant and an income of only four yuan. I had already determined that the house number was the residence of his mother's employer. It was a tall, three-story lane house. As I walked up the first flight of stone steps, asking for the Ji family, a 14- or 15-year-old boy, accompanied by a fair-looking child of six or seven years old, responded. The older boy told me that he was the one I was going to visit. He told me in detail about his life situation in response to my questions.</p>
<p>He is a 14-year-old boy and now studies at Jinghong Elementary School, which is opposite his residence. He is only in the fourth grade after the summer vacation. This is a spring class because he dropped out of school for a year in the middle. His mother works as a "Niangyi" (maid) at the residence and earns only four yuan. She used to work at a factory on Meizhou Road, and he also studied at a primary school on Meizhou Road. When the war broke out, his mother lost her job, and he also dropped out of school. Later, his mother relied on housework to make a living, raising her only son with great care. He followed his mother to help with odd jobs at the employer's house, without pay, only seeking accommodation and food so as not to drift around helplessly. His ancestral home is Chongming, where they have a flat house and three mu of thin fields, rented out to others, with very little income. The mother and son have not returned to their hometown for seven years. He plans to study business after graduating from elementary school.</p>
<p>When I visited him, it was about 11:00 AM. His mother was cooking downstairs for her employer and did not meet me. The other little employer was always watching my Q&amp;A with this older boy. I asked him, do you find our conversation interesting? He was silent. A middle-aged or older returned person, presumably the mistress of the house, raised her voice and asked me what was going on. I told her that I had come to help poor children study. She glanced at me and turned to go into the room. I saw that the bedroom had sofas and Western-style decorations, and it was quite clean.

<h3>Hongkou Japanese Naval Garrison District Prohibits Passage</h3>
<p>Bridges Along the Suzhou Creek Locked Down; Passage Prohibited Without a Quarantine Certificate</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, due to the recent series of cases of genuine cholera in the Hongkou area, the Japanese authorities have established vaccination stations at five locations, including the Garden Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Xinzha Road Bridge, starting on the 5th of this month. These stations will provide vaccinations to passersby from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. As for the naval garrison area north of the Suzhou Creek, passage is absolutely prohibited. On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese Marines, the Japanese Consulate Police Station, and the Xingya Yuan's Central China Liaison Department stationed personnel at places such as the Garden Bridge to check pedestrians. Those who held a vaccination certificate were allowed to pass, while others were not allowed to pass. They had to wait until the vaccination began in the afternoon and be vaccinated by the Japanese authorities before they could pass. Therefore, the order on each bridge at that time was extremely chaotic.</p>
<h3>Epidemic of Dysentery in this City; Residents Urged to Pay Attention to Health Preservation</h3>
<p>Cholera in Hongkou Still Rampant; According to news from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, since the second half of June, the hospital has admitted 65 patients with genuine cholera. Of these, 12 have died, 27 have recovered and been discharged, and the rest are still under treatment. Divided by the patients' residential areas, 24 are from the French Concession, 7 from Nanshi Zhabei, and 35 from the Public Concession. The Public Concession accounts for more than half. It is claimed that the hospital has also recently discovered multiple cases of smallpox and meningitis, which have been sent to the isolation hospitals of the two concessions for medical treatment due to equipment issues. As for private hospitals, it is impossible to count. In addition, some patients go directly to the isolation hospitals of the concessions for treatment, so the number of patients is believed to be more than this number. Currently, the hospital's outpatient clinic receives more than 600 people per day, and the number is increasing daily, which is worthy of attention. Residents are urged to take good care of their health. As for the Hongkou district under Japanese control, although it has been repeatedly disinfected, cases continue to occur. It is learned that on the evening of the 3rd of this month, a crew member of the Japanese-owned Huazhong Water Transportation's ship Dazesumaru, a Japanese man named Matsuo Toshio, suddenly contracted a suspected case of cholera. He was immediately sent to the Tongrenhui Baziqiao Branch, admitted, and isolated. The examination results confirmed that it was genuine cholera. It is reported that as of the 5th of this month, there were a total of 79 patients with genuine cholera in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Fishery in Ningbo Plummeted After the Fall of Ningbo; The Japanese Authorities Forbid Fishing in the Sea</h3>
<p>The fishery in Eastern Zhejiang has traditionally been most abundant in the counties under Ningbo's jurisdiction, and a large number of residents are engaged in fishing. According to people in the fishing industry, the Ningbo fishery has always been managed by the authorities. Fishing belonged to the Yin County Fishing Association, transportation belonged to the Yongfeng Public Office, and sales belonged to the Fresh and Salted Goods Industry Association. Since the fall of Ningbo, the management agencies and groups have withdrawn one after another, resulting in a lack of control. In addition, the Japanese have blockaded various small ports and prohibited fishing boats from going to sea, causing the fishery to plummet. Statistics show that before the war, there were more than 1,500 fishing boats of various types. Now, except for a small number left in Chuanshan, which can still fish, the rest are either prohibited from going to sea or converted into passenger ships, which accounts for the majority of the total. Many were also innocently attacked and sunk or burned. Therefore, the current Ningbo fishery is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. Most of the fresh fish shops can barely maintain their expenses. Transportation and sales to Shanghai have been severely affected due to transportation inconveniences.</p>

<h3>Shenbao Reader Scholarship Fund Continues Investigation Work; The Situation of Impoverished Families is Pitiful; Conscientious Handling Lives up to Readers' Expectations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's Reader Scholarship Fund received more than 3,700 in donations. Philanthropic people from all walks of life are keenly aware that the vast majority of the urban poor live in isolation and have no way to appeal for help. This has aroused compassion and enthusiastic donations. This great act of charity is worthy of cherishing. This newspaper is honored to have played a role in promoting it.</p>
<p>Field Visit; According to the investigation team's report, yesterday alone, five people visited more than 60 families in various parts of the city. Most of them were poor families living under other people's roofs. The places they live in are either kitchens or attics. Whole families were crammed into small rooms. The air was stale, and the scene was desolate. They were suffering all kinds of hardships. In contrast, the rich live in high-rise buildings and live lavishly, while the poor have no place to stand and are starving. It is truly like the feeling of being in hell and heaven.</p>
<p>Conscientious Work; The staff members witnessed everything, and were deeply moved. They were deeply aware of the heavy responsibility of investigation. Therefore, they asked questions in as much detail as possible, and strived to make the report as accurate as possible, so that the money donated by enthusiastic readers would not be wasted in the slightest, and that those impoverished students who are keen to learn and have excellent grades would surely benefit from it.

<h3>Photography Industry Employees Continue Slowdown; Conflicts Continue to Occur</h3>
<p>The 1,000-plus employees of photography studios in this city have been slowing down work since the day before yesterday because their demands for salary increases have not been met. It has been four days. It is learned that the capitalists have drafted an increase plan and plan to negotiate today. Yesterday's slowdown continued. Furthermore, it is learned that conflicts continued to occur yesterday. Two photography studios on Avenue Joffre were reportedly vandalized, causing considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Rowdy Prostitutes Forcibly Solicit Customers and Gang Up to Commit Assaults, Leaving Two Victims Injured and 29 Arrested at the Scene</h3>
<p>Huang Zhicai, an accountant at the Quanxingkang Restaurant on Zhejiang Road, finished his work at around 12:00 AM the other day and was walking north towards home. While passing the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, he was suddenly accosted by prostitutes Wang Xiuying and Zhang Chenshi, who forcibly dragged him into the nearby Guanghua Fang alley, forcing him to stay at Wang's residence. Huang firmly resisted.</p>
<p>Ultimately overpowered, Huang was noticed by Chai Dakang and Liu Awu, two associates from Quanxingkang, who were passing by. They intervened to help. Unexpectedly, the prostitutes gathered many members from the Cantonese-run Yinglian Sports Association at 482 Zhejiang Road (where Wang the prostitute also lived). Armed with knives and sticks, they surrounded Huang, Chai, and Liu, and closed the iron gate at the entrance of Guanghua Fang alley, preventing outside assistance from reaching Huang and his companions. They then severely beat the three men, resulting in Chai and Liu</p>
<p>both sustaining knife wounds. Liu's injuries were more serious, while Huang suffered only superficial wounds. Upon receiving a report, the Lao Zha police station promptly dispatched Detective Ong Hongxun, Detectives Huang Cifu and Chen Junfeng, and Western Constable No. 75. They arrested Wang the prostitute, the prostitute's servant Zhang Chenshi, and Yinglian members Leng Dejin, Zhang Bolin, Wang Jinbiao, Chen Shisheng, Chen Weisheng, Ou Fusheng, and others, totaling 29 individuals. Three firelocks, four broadswords, and six sticks were confiscated. When the detectives were</p>
<p>making the arrests, some individuals attempted to flee, leading to a conflict with Western Constable No. 75. During the struggle, the constable's firearm accidentally discharged, striking a passerby named Xue Bingrong in the leg. The detectives then took the 29 individuals to the police station and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin requested detention pending investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Shen, the order was given to detain them for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Baodaxiang Store on Eight Immortals Bridge Thrown With a Bomb Yesterday, Leaving Five Employees Injured, One Severely</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:50 PM, the Baodaxiang Silk and Cloth Store, located at No. 10, Avenue Dubail, diagonally opposite the Golden Grand Theatre in the French Concession, was bustling with customers when suddenly a man threw a hand grenade into the store. With a loud bang and a puff of thick smoke, five employees immediately fell to the ground, injured. One person was struck in the abdomen by shrapnel and severely wounded, with bloodstains all over the floor. The customers scattered and fled, creating a chaotic scene. The bomber took advantage of the chaos to escape without a trace. Upon receiving the report, the French police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol officers to the scene, sending the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also collected fragments of the bomb and took them back to the police station for examination in order to track down the perpetrator. It is reported that the silk and cloth store is quite prosperous and has repeatedly received threatening letters, which have been quite intense.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Pudong Destroys Over a Hundred Shanties</h3>
<p>In the Nantao Clay Pond area at the southern end of Daxin Street, Lao Baidu, Pudong, there are over 500 shanties, closely packed together like pigeon cages. They are all inhabited by poor migrant workers who rely on stevedoring and rowing boats for a living. They usually lack fire-fighting equipment, so once a fire breaks out, it is impossible to control. Yesterday at 11:05 AM, a fire broke out in the shanty of Fei Lu, a woman from Yancheng, at number 459, due to carelessness while cooking lunch. In an instant, sparks flew everywhere, and the fire spread rapidly due to the strong wind. At that time, the tide was low, and the creek was dry. Most of the men were out working, leaving only women and children at home, making it impossible to draw water to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until 2:00 PM. A total of over 140 thatched shacks were destroyed, and the cries of the more than one hundred affected households were unbearable. No fatalities were reported in the incident, but the true picture will only be clear after all the residents return home in the evening. It is said that no fewer than a thousand people were left homeless and sleeping in the open last night, a truly terrible calamity.</p>
<h3>Two Women Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Xue Bihua, a 19-year-old girl from Ningbo, who was renting a room at No. 12, Guanwu Lane, Avenue Foch, took a large number of sleeping pills to commit suicide at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, for reasons unknown. She was discovered and rushed to the hospital for treatment, her life hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Gong Wangshi, a 34-year-old woman from Chongming, living at No. 21, Hongfu Fang, Route Haig, committed suicide by taking poison at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (6th) due to a family dispute with her husband. She was discovered by her family and rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Busted Upstairs in Restaurant</h3>
<p>Liao Zhongqian, the chief detective of the Public Concession's Gambling Squad, and Detective Feng Qishan learned that a gambling den was being organized upstairs at No. 271 Zhejiang Road, in the Qingyise brothel. They rushed there at 10:00 PM the other night and arrested six operators, Xu Er, Ye Kun, Zhu Wei, Chen Biao, Xu Jia, and Huang Yao, and fourteen gamblers, Huang Yongnan, Lin Can, and others. Gambling paraphernalia such as dominoes and gambling silver were confiscated. It was then discovered that the organizers of this gambling den lived in rooms 308 at No. 430 Zhejiang Road. They again arrested Tan Zuomin, He Sheng, Liu Zemin, Tang Yong, He Rong, and Hu Zao, and confiscated many large and small gambling tablecloths and chips. Yesterday morning, they were all handed over to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. After questioning by Judge Shen, he ordered that the fourteen gamblers be fined ten yuan each as a warning, and that the remaining twelve gambling bosses and organizers be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Pawn Fake Gold Jewelry Detected, Arrest Made</h3>
<p>Guo Zhangshi, a 30-year-old woman from Beiping living at No. 44, Suzou Road in Western Shanghai, took a pair of fake gold bracelets on the afternoon of the other day to the Yongxing Pawnshop at No. 349, Route Lartigue in the French Concession, intending to pawn them for 20 yuan. She was detected by a shop employee Zhang Maohong, who called the police and had her arrested. Two more pairs of the same fake gold bracelets were found on her person. Brought to the police station, she confessed that she specialized in pawning fake gold jewelry, having previously pawned items at the Shunchang Pawnshop on Quinsan Road and the Shengyuan Pawnshop on Rue Amiral Bayle. The police chief dispatched detectives to summon the relevant parties to the station to identify Guo, who was confirmed to be the culprit. The police chief, considering her to be a repeat offender of fraud, ordered her detention pending further investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Benevolent Society Provides Emergency Relief in Nanshi, 80,000 Residents on the Brink of Starvation, Hope for Donations of Dry Food and Medicine from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since the blockade of Nanshi, residents have been prohibited from entering or leaving, and it has been impossible to purchase daily necessities, causing great panic in their lives. Yesterday, the Buddhist Benevolent Society sent members to investigate. It was learned that in the area bounded by Fanghong Road to the south, Minguo Road to the north, Xiaoshijie to the east, and Nanyang Bridge to the west, there are as many as 80,000 residents. Some have starved to death, and some have committed suicide due to hunger. It was agreed with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters that emergency relief could be provided. The society will send members starting this afternoon to carry dry food and medicine for distribution. They urgently hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate dry food such as biscuits and bread, and summer medicines, to the society at No. 18, West Hart Road for distribution. Charitable organizations wishing to send members to assist in the distribution are also welcome to contact the society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that a recent census of the Nanshi refugee area revealed that residents are unable to move freely and are suffering from hunger and thirst. The Tongrenhui Chunshen Congee Kitchen and the Beishi Cilianhui Congee Kitchen have vowed to provide congee and medicine daily, delivering them by car for temporary relief, and also plan to use the ancient method of asking for puffed rice to alleviate hunger, as it is easy to digest and does not harm the stomach.</p>

<h3>Searching One's Heart</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>Given the significant impact of literary and artistic works on readers, a literary writer should, before putting pen to paper, search their heart (conscience!) and ask themselves: Why do I want to write this? What impact will this work have on the reader? What impact do I want this work to have on the reader?</p>
<p>Writers who write for art's sake, writers who see art as a pastime, writers who see literary works as fulfilling personal creative desires, may not want to bother with these questions. They simply want to narrate the story in their minds, and are content as long as the depiction is moving. They have no grand plans, no clear goals; they create for the sake of creating.</p>
<p>However, this is useless. Whether they plan or not, their works will inevitably have a good or bad influence on the readership. This is, of course, directly related to the author's outlook on life and the world, but we will not discuss these for the time being. We simply want to point out a bare fact: whether you admit it or not, a literary work will ultimately have a tangible or intangible, good or bad influence on the reader, and the power over this good or bad influence lies in the hands of the literary writer, and should be the responsibility of the writer themselves.</p>
<p>We hope that every writer will take out their already published works and examine them in detail. For meaningless, numbing, or toxic works, distribution should be stopped immediately. For future works, we hope that every conscientious literary writer will search their heart and ask: What impact will this work have on the reader? What impact do I want this work to have on the reader?</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate Anger?</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Humans are emotional animals, and "joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness" are emotional expressions resulting from external stimuli. People who lack self-cultivation are most easily agitated, which is extremely harmful to one's body. But how can an ordinary person cultivate their emotions? This is indeed a difficult question. You may find many tips for self-cultivation in the books of ancient sages, but with so many ideas, where do you start?</p>
<p>The expression of "anger" is the most undesirable of all emotions. Only those with the highest self-cultivation can easily avoid getting angry often. If someone hits you for no reason, would you not be enraged? Regardless of the direct impact of this "rage" on your body, the important point is how do you eliminate this "rage"? You might scold the person, or even retaliate, but if your anger still hasn't dissipated, then what force will you use to eliminate it? This should be rather interesting.</p>
<p>The person who has studied "anger" most thoroughly is probably Dr. Ruokin Young, an American psychologist, who has devoted himself to the study of the psychology of "anger" for seventeen years. He believes that anger has more harm than good for people; fortunately, all anger can be eliminated by methods. The classification of anger is not based on the degree of anger, nor on the cause of anger, nor on the state of anger, but on the duration of anger. The first type is "latent anger;" for example, a deep hatred, anger in the heart, long-standing, initially not expressed, but later erupting when it becomes unbearable. The second type is "instant anger;" for example, suffering injustice, immediately erupting in anger, unrelated to anything in the past. The third type is "after-the-fact anger;" for example, anger that does not erupt at the time, but leaves behind a kind of "self-pitying" emotion. If we represent them with numbers: 1, 2, 3 representing the degree of anger, with each type of anger represented by a number representing its stage, then the first type is: "1, 2, 3," the second type is: "0, 0, 3," and the third type is: "3, 2, 1." These three different types of anger each have different impacts. According to Yang's conclusions from precise experiments, the time it takes for a person to recover mentally after the three types of anger is in the ratio of 2:1:3. As for the direct impact of anger on a person, it can be expressed by lifting power. The first type of anger can increase a person's lifting power by one-half; the second type of anger can suddenly increase it by more than double; and the third type of anger reduces it by one-quarter. Yang pointed out that the increased lifting power during anger is not something to celebrate, because the impact of anger on the brain nerves is very serious. Yang gave an example: if a person cannot distinguish between orange-red, rose-red, and dark red during normal anger, then that person's brain has suffered a blow of 85 pounds. If, when angry, one feels dizzy and cannot see or hear, then the impact is even greater! Not only is their behavior like madness.</p>
<p>At this time, the most important thing is how to eliminate anger after it has already erupted? Yang believes that with the development of modern science, it may be possible to clear anger with some kind of physical machine. But before a physical machine is invented, it is still more effective to use psychological power. When the first type of anger erupts, reading biographies of great people, famous historical accounts, or recalling stories of great people, historical events, etc., has a peculiar effect on eliminating anger. After the second type of anger occurs, one should quickly leave the current environment, paying special attention to another matter, shifting all mental energy to it, or putting all effort into searching and studying something of particular interest to oneself, which can make anger go away very quickly. Regarding the third type of anger, the gentleness of music and the elegance of paintings are the most effective remedies; even the deepest anger can certainly be eliminated by this means. The above are the methods that Yang believes are most effective and easiest for ordinary people to do. As for the fact that the methods of eliminating anger vary greatly depending on each person's environment, personality, thoughts, and level of education, Yang has given 67 different types of people, each with their own method of eliminating anger, but in general, in principle, it is based on the above methods, and the results obtained after rigorous and detailed experimentation.</p>
<p>Indeed, humans are emotional animals, and emotional expression is inevitable; but to cultivate oneself to the point of suppressing anger and not being moved is indeed not easy. However, if anger has already erupted, quickly eliminating it oneself, this "mending the fold after the sheep have been lost" method is not unworthy of praise!</p>

<h3>Three Stages of Life</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Every life should have three stages:</p>
<p>(1) Education Stage: In this stage, one should make the most of their time and energy to acquire the best knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) Building a Career Stage: After acquiring knowledge, one must go into society to establish a career. One should strive to be a "person"; at the same time, one should plot the greatest happiness for oneself and one's family.</p>
<p>(3) Serving Society Stage: This stage is the most important stage of life, which determines its success or failure and its greatness. One should know that all the money and property one has obtained is given to them by this society, so one must not only care about the comfort of one's own life, but also enable others to live a fulfilling life. Many, many people have failed because they have neglected this point. They have already obtained a lot of money in the previous stage, but they are still not satisfied and are still greedy. They have all forgotten how to repay this society that once cultivated and helped them.</p>
<p>Before leaving this world, everyone should sow some beneficial seeds in this world, so that it grows more beautiful and so that those who live on it can live a more peaceful and happier life. (Original by Edward Bok)</p>

<h3>Food for Air Defense Personnel</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Most of the barrage balloons defending London are moored in the suburbs of London. Due to the remote location and liaison duties, the air defense personnel cannot cook for themselves. The British military authorities organized a central kitchen to prepare food for them, which was delivered by couriers on bicycles. The food, including vegetables, meat, and candy, was packaged in square boxes and transported on bicycles with smaller front wheels for distances of two to ten miles, and distributed to the air defense personnel.</p>

<p>"I'm just afraid it's too late, it's a pity to waste so much tuition!" She said very tactfully while sweeping the floor.</p>
<p>"You don't have to worry about the money, as long as you..."</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia had only spoken half a sentence when she heard a burst of footsteps outside the door. A round, silvery basin-like face was already poking in through the half-closed door. Even Mei Bao didn't have time to wink at her.</p>
<p>"Sister, come over and say a few words!" Meng Dajie, with her fast mouth, shouted impatiently before she even stopped.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, there are still some small things at home, wait..." Mei Shi still wanted to use other words to prevaricate her, so as not to make everyone feel embarrassed by speaking bluntly on the spot.</p>
<p>But Autumn Begonia felt that this matter could no longer be ambiguous.</p>
<p>"Dajie, please sit for a while, can we talk for a few words?" He tried his best to keep his attitude and tone as gentle as usual, because he also understood that the little manager of the Meng family was a complete idiot. Her introducing Mei Shi to Shang Laoer to learn opera was indeed a purely good intention, so he absolutely didn't want to vent his anger on her.</p>
<p>Meng's daughter-in-law heard Autumn Begonia wanted to talk to her, so she immediately sat down with a grin on a square stool near the door, paying no more attention to the faces of the father and daughter.</p>
<p>"Uncle Wu, is the lotus root powder that I sent you last time finished? Do you want me to send you a few more boxes?" She babbled to Autumn Begonia, thinking she was very capable. (178)</p>

<h3>Recent Poetry Recitals</h3>
<p>— Lao Bo</p>
<p>Although poetry recitals have been promoted for a long time, there have been very few opportunities for everyone to hear them, except for a few poets practicing on their own and occasionally giving a public recital. I heard that at the end of last year, the poets in Chongqing had organized poetry recital teams, preparing to divide into teams to recite in various rural areas, which caused a sensation for a while, but soon many people in the cultural circles left Chongqing, and the work of the poetry recital team seemed to stop imperceptibly.</p>
<p>There were three poetry recitals in Shanghai last year, one was the spring recital organized by the Xinglie Society, and the other two were held at the memorial meetings of the two great writers Gorky and Lu Xun, which seemed to have aroused some people's interest and attention. But since the beginning of this year, in the middle of half a year, I have not heard of any recitals being held. Until recently, we heard two poetry recitals again, which made me very interested.</p>
<p>These two poetry recitals did not seem to be the poets practicing recitation in the study and then making it public. On the contrary, the people who recited these two times were a few stage stars and young students. The poetry recital expanded beyond the small circle of poets, which is very beneficial to the development of poetry recitals.</p>
<p>The first time was on the 29th of last month, when the "Mainland Monthly" magazine used the literary broadcast of the Xinxin Glass Radio Station for the first time in Shanghai. In addition to the drama "The Proposal" broadcast by the Juyi Society, Chen Zhitong broadcast Zhang Tianyi's novel "Sloppy Love Story" and many valuable music programs, there was also Miss Lan Lan's recitation of Shelley's famous poem "Ode to the West Wind", and Miss Ye Jingzhen's recitation of Pushkin's famous poem "Farewell to My Homeland"; Miss Zhang Renli recited Ji Fang's original poem "Rose". Broadcasting from the air to every radio, when I received that clear voice, it did give me a very novel feeling.</p>
<p>The second time was the summer poetry recital held by the Lyra Literary Society, which was also held on the 3rd of this month in the auditorium of the YWCA. There were many programs, including the music programs participated by the Experimental Music Troupe, with no less than 30 items. Generally speaking, Miss Ban Zhuo's recitation of Aramaki's poem "Mother", Miss Ke Qing's recitation of Zhu Weiji's poem "Lu Xun's Birthday", Miss Shen Luo's recitation of Bai Shu's poem "Dust Blowing Under the Taihang Mountains", Han Liu's recitation of Xi Jin's poem "Evening Star", and Wu Huo's recitation of Pei Mafei's famous poems "Dog's Song" and "Wolf's Song" were better. However, the voices of many reciters were too low, and they lacked a grasp of language and poetry. In terms of results, it is clear that the many vocal programs of the Experimental Music Troupe overshadowed everything.</p>
<p>But this is not because the future of poetry recitation is not as brilliant as singing, it is precisely because poetry reciters also need to strengthen the practice of basic techniques such as pronunciation, articulation, rhythm, and emotion, just like musicians. I hope that with more attention and promotion from everyone, there will be a day when poetry recitation will be as popular among the people as storytelling and drum singing.</p>
<h3>The Future of Ji Yuliang</h3>
<p>— Zhang Songran</p>
<p>At the end of last month, I went to the Golden Stage to see the complete "Wang Baochuan," focusing on the acts before "Chasing the Three Passes." The entire performance was passable. Apart from Yan Shishan and Ai Shiju, who were somewhat refreshing, the remaining performers were old and past their prime, not worth mentioning. Yan Shishan has the potential to become a star, with a good appearance and decent skills, without the bad habit of being perfunctory. If he can devote himself to studying other plays besides martial ones, he will be no match for Song Dezhu. Ai Shiju came to Shanghai with Mao Shilai and was diligent when he first joined the Golden Stage. His performances in plays like "Xiao Fang Bandit Hook" were excellent and well-received at the time. However, his performance has been declining, becoming increasingly sluggish. Could it be due to an unsuitable pairing or a lack of opportunity to showcase his talents? Nevertheless, as a basic actor in the Golden Stage, he is much better than Qiu Shengrong, who has resigned himself to obscurity.</p>
<p>Zheng Bingru, being a female impersonator, has many supporters. However, upon listening to her performance, I was greatly disappointed. Her pronunciation of tones was unclear, with too many entering tones. For example, she pronounced "刀下留人" (Spare his life) as "到下留人" (Arrive and spare his life), making her spoken parts grating to the ear. Her "Er Liu" and "Liushui" melodies in "Da Deng Dian" were somewhat listenable, but apart from the main melodies, the words were unintelligible.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding Ji Yuliang, some say he is neither Tan nor Ma, while others say he completely imitates Ma and is not worth mentioning. However, in my opinion, although he is young, he still follows the rules. His singing, recitation, and lyrics are all mainstream, and his stage presence is also good. Only his pronunciation of stressed words slightly resembles Ma's lisp, which may be innate and not a serious flaw. I have a very good impression of him and hope that he will avoid Ma's shortcomings, adopt Tan's strengths, and follow Yang (Shisen)'s correct path. Within three years, he will surely surpass Xi Xiaobo and Guan Shaohua, or even exceed Wang Shaolou and Chen Shaolin.</p>
<p>Recently, Guo Chunyang, invited by the Golden Stage, suddenly stopped performing after three days due to illness. Ji Yuliang, who was originally second to Zheng Bingru, was promoted to the main role. Opportunity makes a hero. I sincerely rejoice and hope that Ji will make good use of this opportunity and improve himself. He should avoid being arrogant or lazy, and not imitate Ma's superficiality and self-importance, using novelty to dazzle people. He should also avoid Ma's head-shaking, hip-twisting, nasal humming, and lisp. Great expectations are placed on him.</p>
<h3>Golden Star and Meicheng Begin Cooperation</h3>
<p>Starting August 1st, Golden Star Company has entered into a contract with Meicheng Film Studio to rent its studio facilities. Golden Star's new film "Peach Blossom Lake" has already begun production at Meicheng. Regarding the negotiation process, there have been many rumors about Yan Heming, the head of Meicheng, from the outside world. Some say that the conditions he proposed to Golden Star were quite harsh, but this is not accurate. Yan was formerly a colleague at the Star Film Company, and Zhou Jianyun, one of the heads of Golden Star, was also with the Star administration. They have a long-standing relationship of mutual understanding. Furthermore, Yan has long been known for his integrity in the film industry, so there is no reason for them to clash. According to Golden Star representatives, since moving into the Meicheng Film Studio, the cooperation has been very pleasant.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain in the Garden of Jade</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter XIV: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters in Delicate Silk</p>
<p>Generally, princes and nobles of the imperial clan, in their fine furs and horses, along with the children of elite families, would roam the lakes and seas, shooting slingshots and reciting poems, riding horses on Zhangtai Street. When banquets were held in the Garden of Jade, they would summon courtesans. The air would be filled with the fragrance of silk and the clinking of wine cups. It was truly like the extravagance of foreign emperors, with endless pleasure! Among the group of Wu girls, there was a beautiful woman, like an incarnation of a celestial being, named Chen Yuan, with the nickname Yuanyuan. She was originally from Yufeng. After falling into prostitution, her stunning beauty and elegance made her the leader among courtesans. Not only in the Jiangnan region, but even as far north as Youyan and as far south as Minyue, the name Chen Yuanyuan was on everyone's lips. One can imagine her intoxicating charm. However, as virtue rises, so does evil. At that time, there were many who coveted her, including wealthy merchants, noble young men, civil and military officials, gentry, and celebrities, all of whom considered it an honor to gain the favor of the beautiful woman. There was a licentious young man, surnamed Gao, who was adept at seeking pleasure with women. He had many concubines at home, but he always tired of the old and loved the new, abandoning them as quickly as he loved them. Everyone gave him the nickname "Flower Butterfly." Whenever Yuanyuan saw him coming to her dressing room, she would get a headache, often saying that his vulgarity made her want to vomit for three days. The Flower Butterfly was not unaware of his own shortcomings, but he was so enamored with Yuanyuan that he always wanted to pester her. Little did he know that the beautiful woman had a secret love in her heart. The affections of the heart, whether male or female, are spontaneous and inevitable. It is difficult to explain the cause and effect of this. Yuanyuan was in love with a young man from Qinghe in the city, nicknamed the "Pitying Jade Poet," who had made a blood oath with her. The poet was handsome, talented, and renowned for his writing style, which was as powerful as a tidal wave. His lyrics were exquisite and comparable to those of Liu Yong of the Song Dynasty. Yuanyuan admired his talent and loved his appearance, and her heart was completely captivated. Therefore, the Flower Butterfly regarded the poet as a thorn in his side, an enemy in the field of love who could hinder his success. Yuanyuan was not unaware that she was being envied, so she deliberately feigned illness and moved her residence to Hengtang to make it difficult for people to approach her. Little did she know that men like Dengtuzi would still come running at the first hint of her presence. How could Yuanyuan have a moment to breathe? But her foster mother had always intended to exploit this situation to make her a cash cow and reap the benefits. (135)</p>
