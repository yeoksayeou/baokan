<h3>太平洋危機益迫　越泰談判臨最後關頭　日調解建議含哀的美敦性質　昨午夜滿限尙未接法方答覆</h3>
<p>東京　據負責方面宣稱、法政府對於日本調停泰越糾紛之提議、今晚未必答覆、截至今日傍晚六時止、法方並無照會致日外務省、且無行動暗示以後有所約定、海外所傳日方曾發出最後通牒將於今日午夜滿限之說、殊非事實、據可靠方面表示、日政府希望明日能接護法方之切實答覆云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間人士之意見、日本撤退越南僑民、與東京調停會議遭遇嚴重危機兩事、發生之時間適相符合、可以表示日本正在準備獲得行動之自由、此次日本之出面調停、顯然要求優厚之代　、現傳已發生重大之坎坷、越南問題是否將釀成太平洋戰爭、　為大眾所注意、（二十八日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　維希政府對於日本最後所提解決越泰糾紛辦法之態度、仍不切實明瞭、今日下午政務會議會出貝當上將主席開會、討論局勢、協理兼海長達蘭聞已展綏其赴巴黎之行、俾出席會議、結果如何現尙不知、昨晚某政府發言人談穩、維希政府已規定最高限度之讓步、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　聞諸此間負責人士、日本以泰越邊界紛爭調人資格而提出之和平建議、在日方視之乃調人之最後條件、泰越雙方唯有接受此方案或完全加以拒絕之辦法「日日新聞」撮述維希與越南來電、以為法當局有拒絕日方建議之勢、且「因第三者取威脅態度之結果、已　請越南境內擁護特戈爾之份子予以協助」云越南當局對於日方建議雖有若干點　予同意、然在一般上仍意見大相逕庭云、同時泰越接受日方調停建議之截止期、僅剩十八小時、東京各報皆以顯著地位載法方尙未以其態度正式通知日本之消息、但聞泰國已通知日本、謂可接受日方二月二十四日　出之建議、　塲對於日方建議事、保持緘默、消　靈通觀察家則一致認日方建議為最後性質、接受建議之截止期雖　正式規定、但一般人皆知日政府期望越南在今日午夜前予以接受或拒絕、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>西貢　權威方面今日證實越南曾接獲日本及泰國之哀的美郭書、該哀的美敦書之限期、係於今日夜半屆滿、此間某日方官員語合眾社記者稱、大量日海軍現正向南前進、權威方面復稱、越北之日軍現亦從事增强、在東京（越南之東京）日空軍昨日已大事增强云、某日本官員語員語合眾社記者、謂東京有日軍二千人、在河內、有大批日空軍、海防及越南南面則有日艦、故越南必須接受泰日之最近要求云、此間各項預兆雖皆表示最後關頭將臨、但消息靈通方面則多數以為在最後一分鐘將有某種妥協以阻止爆發、法國消息靈通方面本日謂相信東京之泰越邊界爭端談判必致失敗、因日本及泰國之立塲極不合理、消息靈通方面復謂越南或將與不止一國作戰、但日本如越出在外交上支持泰國之限度外、則新加坡及中國距離並不遠云、（二十八日合眾電）</p>
<p>維希當局表示　讓步自有限度</p>
<p>維希　政府發言人論述泰越停戰談判稱、法國政府已決定最高讓步之限度、萬不能再讓一寸、發言人又云、依照德法停戰協定、吾人有保護法國海外殖民地之權利、吾人必須予以遵行、據上海報告、此次日本向法方提出而遭法方拒絕之條件、係日本之最後條件、此說現經此間稱為舖張過度、合眾社探悉、法副總理達蘭於星期六通知美大使李希、法國需要戰爭用品、以維持越南之完整、深盼美國能售予飛機戰具等件、並從速交貨、聞截至現時、華盛頓尙未予答覆、惟先時美國務卿赫爾曾拒絕以飛機戰料運往越南、法宣傳部稱、越南實際已在封鎖之中、吾人飛機及軍隊太少、海軍只有巡洋艦一艘、砲艦數艘、但仍能抵禦泰國之進攻、吾人空軍之成績較泰國為佳、海軍亦擊敗泰國之軍艦、實際吾人已擊敗泰國之進攻矣、該官員稱、因越督德古及越南法軍總司令摩當新近會議之結果、法國已準備任何事變、現時之僵局多延一日、即增加危險一日、照法國之最大讓步、泰國可取得老撾省湄公河以西之全部柬埔寨北部一狹條、及西部地帶、但法國不能割讓派克西及湄公河東之城鎮、法國不擬提出任何新計劃、應由日本及泰國決定行止也、（二十八日合眾社電）</p>
<p>維希　關於法泰兩國代表在東京談判情形、此問官方人士咸守緘默、堅稱談判至現階段、各關係方面均應由以極審慎之態度、國外所傳別有作用之消息均屬一種抹煞事實之曲解、法國及各外國報界幸勿為所朦蔽、要之法國對於泰國與越南邊境糾紛所取立塲、與前無異、查越南與泰國現行邊界、係一九〇七年條約所劃定、即泰國政府亦曾迭次聲明無可變更、泰國根據此項條約所歸越南之土地原屬越南東埔寨邦、直至一八六七年始由泰國佔領、泰國在一九〇七年將此項土地歸還越南時、雙方所劃邊界頗於泰國有利、越南方面目曾給予種種利益、迄至一九四〇年六月十二日法泰兩國並曾根據一五〇七年條約簽訂互不侵犯協定、時至此際、法國雖已接受日本調解、但法國在條約上所處立塲、並不因而有所變更、（二十八哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>威爾斯分別接見　蘇日大使</h3>
<p>華盛頓　　國務副卿威爾斯昨午後分別接見日大使野村及蘇聯大使烏曼斯基、（廿八日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務副卿威爾　分別接見蘇日兩國大使、引起外　界之不少推測、認為遠東又有新緊張之勢、據報烏曼斯基對於美國未能　解對於　蘇物品之制限、頗為失望、（二十八日合眾電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>行矣寇利博士</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏私人代表寇利博士，與經濟專家戴普萊博士來華，負有調查使命；閱三星期，於前日公畢由渝乘飛機赴港，將於明日遄返美國。以寇氏瀕行所表示之切實而誠摯，知此行必能以中國財政經濟狀况；歸報羅總統，行見美國援華，當能一掃以前之踟蹰却顧，更趨於積極明朗，是誠中美兩國之福。蓋惟中美兩國對峙於太平洋之兩岸，而後太平洋之太平可保；若一有傾欹，則必形成畸輕畸重之局，美人有西顧之憂，兩國無安枕之日，惟此休戚所共，故必患難相扶；明乎此，則寇利博士此行爲不虛矣。</p>
<p>國際通例，凡所以招待他國之使節者，必視其使命之意義而恰如其分。我有旨酒，宴樂嘉賓，爲詩人所美；若以禮尙往來，不能無酬酢；使節遙臨，不能無盛會；此誠末節，夫亦常情。今寇利博士雖常以「招待盛情，不勝感激」，藉以避免其對於調查工作詢問之正面答復；並有「如無許多宴會，尙可多作研究」之表示：抑又聞之，寇利博士於此絕短時期內，完成其繁賾複雜之工作，猶能增加體重十磅而歸，揆之招待外使，務使康豫之旨，則爲之主人之中國，所引爲欣慰者也。况寇利博士所負之使命，在於搜集材料；據聞彼已搜集其欲搜集之材料，而此複雜之材料，能於短時期內蕆事，正見中國當局之所以招待嘉賓者，不僅酬酢之末節而已；抑得心應手，左右逢源，此非組織健全，指臂靈活不爲功，寇利博士因此而得完成其使命，此亦中國抗建偉業旣已備具基本經緯之徵也。</p>
<p>「中國所需求者甚少，美國所欲援助者殊多」，大體而若此，似屬離奇，實可欣慰，誠以中國固有之美德，乃爲刻苦耐勞，惡衣服，菲飲食，作戰之所以再接再厲，士氣之所以不屈不撓，與夫建設之因陋就簡，所獲成效之事半功倍，皆以固有美德爲之基調。我人誠未知甚少之所需，是何項目。所得略舉者，經濟之外，新兵器如飛機重砲，必亟待美國接濟。以言接濟，則中國沿海口岸之通道，方爲日本之兵艦大砲所控制；越南又慴於日方之暴力，以致封閉滇越鐵道，所可賴以接濟之途徑者，只滇緬公路，是亦在日本空軍破中；幸而中國所訓練之修補工程，異常敏捷，運輸得綿延不絕；然日本倘若兼程南進，窺馬南，據荷印，則滇緬公路之威脅更重；故美國援華，尤當對於援華通道之迅捷安全特別致意，此其一。無論其爲經濟，爲交通，爲軍事·爲器械·要皆爲現代科學之產物，賴有熟練之技士，方可收駕輕就熟之效；故美國雖絕對不必遣兵至中國前綫，然技術人才之如何調撥來華，應爲考慮之項目，此又其一。中國經濟方面之複雜情形，寇利博士不難深悉之，蓋破有人，攘奪有人，時局之變化愈亟，經濟之瘡痍愈深，故紐約自由英鎊、英國卒能善加處理之；而上海黑匯市塲，中國猶無妥善之辦法；雖美匯之改爲儲蓄存款，已爲初步之整理，然未來不可逆料之詭謀，正耽耽於其旁，逐逐於其後。美國擁有過剩之黃金，正應別籌出路，然則如何搘持中國之法幣，以協調中國之戰時經濟，此又其一。吾人誠不知中國當局向寇利博士等提示所需者，於此數者之外，尙有幾許項目；即此項目，我人亦自樂聞寇利博士所謂決不使中國失望之期許。抑中國獲助於美，當然不能無所酬償，酬償之道，或得循一般之商業方式，此在夙尙信義之中國，諾言便足爲最可恃之保證，而一般之物質保證條件，在方式上宜居次要，抑且在性質上爲不必要。而中國尤願償之美國者：無窮盡之商業門戶也，太平洋之悠久穩定也，國際道義，人類文明之發揮光大也，中美兩國族之性靈相應而熱烈誠摯之友誼也，共當患難，共制强暴之超文字的盟的也，守衛民治之生死交也。寇利博士等此行，其於續予中國以援助之前，感覺先已飽獲此類酬償而歸矣乎！</p>
<p>越南日僑奉命　凖備隨時撤退</p>
<p>河內　越南全部日僑共四百人、現正遵照昨日河內西貢日總領事所發準備隨時全體撤退之通知、匆遽束裝作離境計、按此爲六個月內之第二次行動、第一次撤退命令、乃上年八月二十二日法國接受日本駐兵河內要求最後一時前所發、據河內日人消息、越南法當局現遵守二月二十六日越督德古所召集之軍政長官緊急會議之決議、此項決議一致反對大規模瓜分越南、日觀察家謂越南法當局之取此立塲、因信英美兩國必將制止日本以强迫手段實行對泰越所提出之建議、觀察家皆信苟非維希命令、或爲日本大軍所迫、則法當局不致更變此種態度、觀察家又謂、上年八月日本企圖駐兵越南時、法當局即用此延宕政策以對付之、並倚賴籍英美之勢力、制止日本用武力行事、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>大阪　據今日此間消息、大阪郵船會社已訓令所有回航各輪準備裝載由越南撤退之日僑、今日由盤谷經越南各埠來日之盤谷丸、及昨由神戶啟椗八日可抵海防之拉普拉太丸、均已奉令爲由越南撇退之日僑預備艙位、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日方消息靈通人士宣稱、日本調停泰越邊境糾紛會議之成敗、將直接影饗法日對越南之經濟談話、並或將終於波及維希與柏林之關係、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>緬甸邊境防務增强　新加坡水雷區擴大</p>
<p>新加坡　今日此間人士因外傳日方已發出實際之哀的美敦書、謂法國苟不在今晚午夜之前加以接受、即將訴諸强迫手段以實行解決云云、故對於越南局勢均認爲極端嚴重、鑒於昨日法方之公開宣言、將不能再作讓步、似頗難想像、此兩種反對之意見將如何融和一致、倘使公開衝突發生、則觀於目前遠東事務之微妙狀態、誠不知將伊於胡底、但新加坡自信現已能應付任何紧急事變、而最近曾加速布置緬甸防務、亦已大有進展、彼等在越南領海外之海軍力量亦頗爲可觀、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>新加坡　今日官方宣布，通新加坡港及泊船所之東面各入口、將自三月三日起敷設水雷、禁止通航、此項新辦法、已將新加坡周圍之現有水雷區域、予以擴充、各船駛入將自負責任、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　外傳新加坡日僑婦孺現正撤退、今日有人向情報局發言人石井詢問、是否由當局下令出此、石井予以否認、但稱日僑現正在目動撤退中、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>日本發言人石井稱　未對越提最後通牒</p>
<p>東京　日政府發言人石井今晨吿外籍記者者、日本調處泰越糾紛事之局勢、現甚爲緊張、吾人不從事於神經戰、吾人現作眞正之準備、但並無向法方提出哀的美敦書事、因調停者不能發出哀的美敦書也云、石井否認日艦九艘已往西貢之說、亦不證實泰國已接受日平最後提議之消息、但謂日本最後提議可視爲有泰國接受之表示、石井承認日本曾允尊重越南之土地完整、以爲上年日越締結協定允日軍駐紥北越之報答、惟繼於答語中又稱、日本建議越南以土地交還泰國、此舉完全符台該協定、至於日本關於土地之允諾、與泰國邊界爭端無關、石井又謂法大使於昨日下午二時訪問松岡、留談甚久、但拒絕宣露談話之性質、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>日亟圖建立共榮圈　不滿法越延宕政策</p>
<p>東京　「朝日新聞」今日載稱，聞日政府現堅決反對越南局希圖延宕接受日本之調解泰越爭端建議、蓋長此延宕、將招致第三方面干涉東亞之共榮圈、且將籍使亞洲東南部「巴爾幹」化、而拒絕日本在東亞之領袖地位也、當局現復下撤退越南日僑命令、而令彼等準備於　月七日正午即泰越休戰滿期之時離境、據謂此乃豫防大局惡化之計畫、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>德國極力拉攏日本　傳松岡將訪問柏林</p>
<p>紐約　德外長里賓特羅甫與駐德日大使大島在柏林之討論、與日外相松岡不久將往柏林之消息、在此間人士觀之、顯爲德國極力拉擺日本、欲其依照三國盟的加入戰爭之又一表示、而日本亦願於英國失取似不能免時、僅與英國發生衝突、庶可儘量佔領地球上面積而無與美國衝突之必要、昨日東京傳來之消息、使美國注意於二月十八日日方發言人所發「吾人欲一再聲明三國盟的旨在和平」一語、但此種言論之價値、不爲美國所接受、此乃觀於蒲立特昨夜在紐約國外出版業俱樂所發之演詞而可知者、蒲氏之言曰、「愛鄰如已、此語如向希特勒·史丹林·墨索里尼·與日本軍閥言之、則徒聞　誹笑耳、吾人不能期望彼等在與吾人或任何他國交涉中予人以榮譽或慈惠、德義日三國根據其五個月前在柏林締結之盟的、已公然聯合與我爲敵矣、」蒲立特非以製造政策者資格或大使身份發言、乃國務院以其演詞分送各報、此中意義可以想見、此間觀察家皆深信美國朝野莫不認日本與德義沆瀣一氣、而爲仇視美國立國所根據的自由與民治之一國矣、松岡最近關於大洋洲之要求、雖東京後來之情報已稍爲之解釋、然終引起此間人士之廣泛譴責、斥爲狂妄而含有嚴重澈義、蓋松　言及八萬萬人生活之空間時、其所指者非爲太平洋少數島嶼、但爲甚廣大之區域、此項問題何等重大、松岡殆不能發揮其私人意見、是以渠所言者定爲日本政策憑以製定之事物也、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>著名新聞報告員阿爾考脫、昨日在大陸報發表一文、題為「大角海軍大將　文件」、分析大角飛　出事、與最近二三星期內遠東局勢變化之關係、語多道人所未道、今將其原文迻譯如次、英國大使之來滬、使人回憶過去二三星期中所發生之種種問題耍人言論、並若干巧合之事件、及因上項事件而引起之遠市緊張局勢、余之觀察或有錯誤、然余檢討之結果、以爲過去二三星期中所有之驚人事件、如英美重申撤僑勸告、澳大利亞軍隊開抵新加坡等等、與本月初日　在廣東失事、大角海軍　將須賀少將等重要日人殞命、皆有聯帝關係、至目下爲止、日機失事時、究曾發生何事、各方仍在辯論中、華方仍堅持該機係游擊隊所擊落、日方則稱　自行出事，屍體係何方所得、並非重要問題、</p>
<p>華方獲得　大角文件</p>
<p>値得重視者、厥爲華方聲稱、彼等曾自大角遺物中獲得文件、據重慶所傳來之報告稱、檢査此類文件、發見　角係與其屬員搭　南飛、參加與日小南進有關之工作、華方自發表該項消息後、即不再有極重要之消息傳來、然日機出事、大角殞命後、最短之時間內、曾發生若干重要之事、大角死後之數日、澳洲代理首相伐登即發表其驚人言　稱、太平洋局勢嚴重、而英國　華大使寇爾爵士、亦取消其香港之行、上海又接到報告稱、重慶外交界有相當之外交活動、日本飛機係　月五日出事、然消息至二月九日始傳出、我人知該機墮落之地點、係在華方游擊隊控制之區域內、除此而外、即不能證實中日兩者何方之見解爲是、然據可靠外人方面所傳　之消息稱、華方確曾見大角大將所携之文件、</p>
<p>重要措施　陸續發展</p>
<p>因之而起之問題爲過去周中所發生之種種　化、是否係該項文件之情報所觸發、有若干地位重要之人、即如此相信、舉例言之、伐登稱渠適接獲一　告、因之感覺太平洋情勢嚴重、伐登發表此項言　時、距大角海軍　將逝世消息之傳出、僅三四日、　之荷蘭又因若干宣佈之理由、將在海中航行之荷倫召回至馬尼刺、離馬尼刺灣不久之芝楂化加號、因接獲考里傑尼美國要塞之信號亦中途折回、二月—四日、華盛頓國務院又重申撤僑勸告、令上海及其他遠東口岸之美僑撤退、此後消息博來、新加坡海峽、業已安置水雷、據余所得之情報、英人係在大角大將殞命之消息傳出後、開始在海峽安置水雷、新加坡埋置水雷俊、該處又突然有曼麗皇后號及若干英船開到、運來澳人利亞軍隊一師左右、有資格之觀察家咸相信、此類澳軍、原係運赴埃及、因接獲驚人消息，故突然在新加坡上陸、數小時後、英當局父重申前令、勸苦上　英僑撤退、</p>
<p>東京方面　極度不安</p>
<p>自上述種種情事發生後、東京即在苦惱焦慮之空氣籠罩之下、事實上日本首都高級官員已呈驚惶失措之象、使人相信、其間必曾發生不妙之事、即彼等原以爲世界人士蒙於鼓中之計劃、突被揭發、及後彼等又提出若干調停戰事　愚蠢建議、官稱願爲「世界各處糾紛之調人」、其後又出爾反爾、否認曾提出調解之建議、結果終歸於失敗、而日本實行南進計劃、亦內英美已作準備、故已不若過去猖獗囂張、太平洋之戰禍，是否將因之避免、殊不可知、目下之事實、爲英美兩國已深感彼等所有之情報、十分重要、不能僥伴圖存、是以美國參議院外交委員會喬治稱、渠預料遠東將有種種發展、而伐登亦一再聲稱目下之局勢、雖已不若過去之驚人、然仍嚴重、余以爲當過去三星期遠東緊張之內幕故事最後之眞相大白時、必可知發生大角文件一事、對於局勢緊張、有相當之關係、</p>
<h3>滬西特警　展期成立　有改至本月十五日說</h3>
<p>滬西「警權協定」、於上月一日簽字後、陳公博即「任命」潘志傑爲「滬西特別警察總署長」、同時工部局亦舉薦克立沙爲「副總署長」、雙方談判組織問題、該「署」原定今日成立、茲悉現以預算問題、迄今無法解決、而人事問題、亦未能完全決定、故難如期實現、據昨日日文大陸新報記載、潘志傑爲向南京方面有所接洽、已於二十五日飛寗、而陳公博亦於二十八日離滬、故滬西「特警總署」、一時恐難成立、</p>
<p>父據外人方面消息、原定今日成立之「特警」、因「總署長」潘志傑與「副署長」克立沙之會談未能如期結束、聞將改至三月十五日成立、同時工部局警務處所推薦之最後一批「特警」人選六十餘人之名單、已於昨日送交工部局、請求批准、然後交由陳公博「任命」、如所提人選雙方無問題、則潘志傑與克立沙談判之主要問題、亦將隨之解決、而「特警」亦可望三月中</p>
<h3>中美日報昨舉行　經濟座談會　討論美日戰爭與上海前途</h3>

<h3>自馬尼刺撤退　日僑一批過滬　據稱美日關係益趨惡化　將否發生衝突尙難預料</h3>

<p>車資</p>
<p>査公共汽車車資、上年曾兩度提增、第一次於四月十五日起實行、普加百分之四十五、第二次自十二月十七日起計增百分之二十五、所以加價之原因、厥爲國幣繼續貶値、外匯緊縮、以致營業用費　增、倘非提增車資、則公司方面、維持爲難、</p>
<p>路綫</p>
<p>十七路公共汽車自前年六月份起開闢、自靜安寺起至小沙渡路止、目的在乎宣揚膠州公園、行駛以後、車資收入、不足抵銷開支、卒於匕年十月三十一日宣告停止、自外灘至威海衛路一段、原屬十四路公共汽車之路綫、自七月十七日起、改爲四路下表所示、爲上年與前年公共汽車行駛哩程覽乘客人數之比較、</p>

<p>下表所示、爲一九三六年與上年電車行駛哩程與載客人數之比較、</p>

<h3>美僑民久護照　限期呈繳</h3>

<p>上海電力公司、以存煤僅敷三個月之用、該公司副總裁費禮思稱、如短期內無法獲得煤斤之源源接濟、則三個月後該公司勢難繼續供給全部電流、聞該公司前會向華北印度訂購大批煤斤、然二地皆因缺乏船隻、無法運滬、此一問題、相當嚴重、據西報記載、工部局董事會於上月二十五日即一度召集會議、當時聽取電力公司代表之整個報告、並定於昨日下午繼續開會、討論因電力公司無法獲得煤斤、而將引起之公共租界電流供給量减少問題、」據日文大陸新報記載則稱、電力公司曾要求工部周、核准共將電流供給量减少百分之六十、但此說並未　實、據華董虞洽卿氏吿大中社記者、關於此一問題、工部局董事會並未止式提出討論、故昨日開會說不確、但各董事間確有非正式接洽、現正商請英國大使寇爾爵士疏　船隻</p>

<p>英美俱見放長</p>

<h3>金價盤旋　現貨堅昂不變</h3>
<p>昨現金烚赤暗盤市况、始終盤旋於六千一百元與二百元之間、原因中美簽訂協定之消息已深入經營者之心、反應賣出有　、但一般老投機仍作暫時購進、故跌後時被拉起、遂呈盤旋模樣、午盤最低達六千一百二十元、時外匯報長、及公和大豐德孚賣出所致、午收僅六千一百四十五元、午後開盤續挫、曾少至六千一百零五元、後匯市微回、恒記德孚大豐及證券幫有吃胃、提升至六千一百八十元、故晚收穩定、六千一百六十九元、比上日小一元而已、現金則步漲木止、中興售予祥和及德孚各五十兩、成記出祥和二百兩、為照期交價高六百三十元、天元聯興福康永共出六十兩價高六百三十五元、由中興復進、下午合盛出祥和五十兩、高六百二十五元、至二月期所剩六千九百四十兩未清條額、多空方槪照匯豐銀行進口美匯五元五六二五合六千二百六十元零七角軋平、全日成交尙旺、一萬二千餘兩、銀樓飾金未更、關金等平、</p>
<p>晨初人心觀望、開時交易缺乏、毫無精彩、價為二千一百七十元、與上日收市價相同、開後於供多下、退至六千一百六十元、但尙有散戶補進、回至六千一百九十元、不料各方人心頹唐、因外匯美金又長、利空成分依然濃厚、致拋塞下撳達六千一百三十元、嗣賴新豐永一意購進、高至六千一百九十元、終以公和大豐德孚合盛等見抬價又出、故盤旋降至六千一百二十元、後復升至六千一百七十五元、此乃鑫源頓萌買意、德大亦相當撈入、奈合盛等於收盤前奮售、卒跌至六千一百四十元、千收祇六千一百四十五元、午後開盤續疲為六千一百三十元、且一大來塞、竟挫達六千一百零五元、後聞外匯略俏、恒記成記大豐德孚及證券幫各戶先後拖入、勢乃向上、挺至六千一百八十元、至收盤變化尙少、結果告六千一百六十九元、比隔昨軋小一元全日上落八十五元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出價始終未更、計大　行　六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元、</p>
<h3>美票背匯市上漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價起落不定、卒告平穩、惟現金　俏、故英美金鎊各漲一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票背滙市趨漲、緣因外銀行納胃甚佳、故於上午曾高至八角三分、卒為十七元八角二分、比上日軋升一角、香港票跌後回平、日金票及朝鮮票需要愈殷、市價賡續挺漲、前者續高至一元七角八分半、後者續升至一元四角六分、</p>
<h3>銀準會匯劃存息</h3>
<p>二月份月息二厘</p>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、訂定二月份同業匯劃存款息、為每千元二元、（即合月息二厘）、與一月份同、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市三態</h3>
<p>粳疲洋緊糯米定</p>
<p>昨日米市、呈各個不同之局面、粳米疲、洋米緊、糯米定局、　國米前朝因來源轉夥、而告回疲、昨則零星到貨續旺、其中以薄稻要居三分之二、而本鄕店舖銷塲、仍感價格昂貴、納意不健、致薄稻身骨較軟、不耐堅守、貨主亟謀脫手、售意更　、繼甩　元之巨、開青角斛見薄稻百零二元半、次至百零一元半、厚粳以貨稀關係、所貶無多、僅落元砠、開崑山　元白粳百零七元、次至百零五見　糯米一朝轉疲、價格落低、詎意一般　主、因見洋米續緊、不願再事輕脫、市貨突稀、不過去路依然滯澀、市面遂乏變化、香港特團粒猶為八十九元、長粒八十六七元、至於擯持之洋米、形勢反覺更緊、其如現貨僅有開出浦東棧一號西貢八十五元、及回籠一號暹邏八十五元、次米菉七十三元、七十二元半、</p>
<p>中次米為主、成交不逾三千包、惟期　回籠一度扳俏後、旋以定　續妥轉平、計新成交合義三月份碎西貢一千二百噸、價八十元零九分、慎記又一千五百噸、價八十元零三角、建元暹邏元米三月份五百噸、故碎洋米已趨平、而洋元跌二元也、回籠期貨開一號西貢路貨及二月份均一百元、小絞一月九十二元、三月上九十一元半至九十二元、成交因有浮戶售出計開近千噸、價亦與前市相接近、洋米　底調查、據說昨午止計為七十五萬零七百四十包、但祇係各堆棧公開存數、至大囤戶私人儲藏之數量、尙不易調查也、</p>
<h3>洋粉步步加鬆</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日續見低落、蓋自　部局分配平平賣粉兩天後、本街進胃銳減、浮戶亟亟求售、聞本月初整批洋粉接踵而至、洋麥亦有一二船可到、故人心平淡、市氣不振、統市做開鐘樓及花鳥兩牌澳粉一千餘包、及藍麥花牌五百包、價同為二十五元六角、比前續低　角、路貨到埠在即、須待到後再售、市面疲憊乏神、</p>
<p>小麥到銷依然兩寂、華廠方面、正待洋麥接濟、即可繼續開車、日廠進胃較貪、但終無相當現貨可收、聞最近接洽拋貨、亦未辦就、故市面沉寂如故、</p>
<h3>證券　公債買進居多</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市信孚及十六號新華聯和德孚進胃甚强、而尤以午後為甚、及至午後將收盤時、忽有協　號因為時已遲、急於求甚、至將市價暫見壓小、而蓬勃之氣為之稍折、但趨勢仍甚穩定、午前交易較小、信孚順昌職和久豐買進、德隆同康協大恒孚賣出、午收微堅一二角、午後信孚吃胃更濃、新華德孚益昌聯　繼之、丙種開盤即為六十六元、潤德亦有進胃、市價冉冉上騰、雖有　隆同康怡太同順聯和等賣出、市價仍立定於六元　三角、收盤將屆、忽協大有臨時交易賣出　　十萬元、恒孚協興沅協康乘低吸收、復將六元價敲破、目下人心尙不一致、看好　因美英援華愈覺强而有力、觀寇利特使之滿意而歸、中美經濟合作已無問題、看小者以為日美問題緊張、而付息日期尙遠、雙方看法、仍以多方理比較充足　而况現在多頭、大都為金融界及華僑、前途仍當樂觀也、市價結果微小五分一角至二角、乙種無上落、丁種及九六仍未做開、成交約二百　三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>

<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股　百股、價為七元七　云、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、行　槪無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市忐忑</h3>
<p>現棉銷路頓絕</p>
<p>紗市轉疲、且跌風又起、此因市盤提高後、實需依然清淡、有一部份盈利者吐出、至於靠近紗廠方面之某某等、上日巨量的拖進、今則復來大批拋出、可想人心恍惚不定、因之市盤上下不一、目前狀况、就電力減少而論、當然看升、但實際地位絕少進展、雜牌紗廉宜、雙馬亦受牽掣也、二十支雙馬高價為一千三百九十一元、低價為一千三百五十七元、午後初做一千三百六十元至五十八元、升至一千三百八十六元、最低為一千三百八十元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨　承上日午後不振之氣續進、首盤價為一千一百七十元、但檯面上的人們大都搶多頭帽子而進、少頃昂至一千三百九十一元、旋聞外匯寗靜、及黃金下挫、又絡續而跌至一千三百五十七元、收盤回好至一千三百六十四元、查　日間成交統計七千七百三十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一七五　寗波　一〇</p>
<p>同行七·四五〇　統計　七　七三五</p>
<p>本日（一日）有棉紗二千零二十件運香港、</p>
<p>現棉情形依然沉寂如恒、廠方需要不振　趨勢平淡、一日有棉花一百八十四件運烟臺、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、市况頗為堅定、惟因南方幫　有賣出、以及少數多頭了結、於是市價突跌、結果收盤價格較之上日低落四五磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉仍無多大漲跌、昨日連同預測低落一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况呆滯、殊少活躍之狀、日來現紗情形雖有利原棉之採購、但各方意與闌珊、對之無動於中、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油餅盡被投機控制</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市况俱告上升、乃因人勢利多、人心向榮、期貨祗豆油有市、然現餅有囤戶吸收、故市漲二角、豆油雖到存兩足、但被投機控制、市風不易過小、昨市反形昂升元外、統計做開大連豆油現貨一百桶、價為百十九元二角半、訂三月上交四百桶、價為一百二十元至十八元半、復升至十九元五角、訂三月下交三百桶、一百十九元至十九元半、訂四月上交一百五十桶、一百四十七元至六元五角、江北本坊油五十桶、一百四十元、豆餅開出牲記餅五千片、七四元八角半至十五元、元隆餅三車、十五元至十五元一角、肥字餅十四元八角半至十五元一角、成交四五車、生油二十八日進口、由青島來一千一百六十聽、三月一日出口、有豆子三百三十五包、豆餅九千三百三十塊均運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　生絲「統制」　又踏進一步</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、互有漲跌、本埠絲價、堅持未動、各洋莊雖有進胃、唯因存底缺乏、故交易寥寥無幾、目前大部份交易、如金箭金葉羅兵漢等、訊係上海僅存之一二絲廠所出品、</p>
<p>又訊自今日起、本埠工商檢騐局所用之生絲出口證、即黃紙頭、改為綠紙頭、且以後各項生絲、皆須受其品質檢騐、此亦乃進一步之統制政策也、今日有茶葉二百六十八件運烟台、</p>
<h3>疋頭　南北走銷兩清</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢轉疲、浮囤出籠、售盤均見下挫、實貴細布晨開四十三元、較上日每疋跌二角半、午後續跌五角、成交怡和粗布、每疋跌二角半至五角、各廠細布斜紋每疋跌五角至七角半、漂染布跌五角之譜、本街成交各布五百餘件、浙紹甬各幫辦色布　色斜·漂布等一百餘件、　幫辦色布·府綢等一百數十件、粵澄幫辦色布·斜紋等二百餘件、南洋幫及北幫生意均極清淡、三月一日有疋頭二千三百三十四件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　先跌後漲、市盤仍穩、白貨龍頭細布最高做開四十七元五角、最低降至四十六元八角半、結果為四十七元三角半、收盤色　四君子嗶嘰廻旋在一元二角七八分、收市每　價一元二角七分七五、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖產地報漲</h3>
<p>洋糖產地　漲、據　蘭　十元零八角二分五厘、香港電二十二元七角五分、公會劃盤、太古車白升五角、B嘜七十九元、HX嘜七十六元五角、二四粗白外棧現貨七十九元、期貨升五角、下月十日打單七十九元二角至五角、二十日打單七十九元六角至八十元、</p>
<h3>雜項　香煙又見收買</h3>
<p>香烟昨日買氣緊俏、因囤戶吸力頗健、致價再漲、如大英牌開一千三百零二元、老刀牌九百六十四元、五華牌六百八十六元、小仙女牌六百七十七元、金鼠牌中箱四百六十五元、美麗牌中箱七百十元、福新金字塔牌廠方　派至回業不敷市銷、價趨緊、做開七百元、</p>
<h3>海味　西淡存底日薄</h3>
<p>西　淡菜、近乏續到、以致市存日見單薄、價乃續升、昨市出辦淡為　百六十元、大淡　百四十元、中淡二百二十五元、小淡　百十元、市象穩秀、</p>
<h3>藥材　召雲來源缺乏</h3>
<p>召雲汕頭來源　乏、　方亦已無存積、惟行方尙有手貨、故趨勢甚俏、查首市開過一百〇八元、現行盤依然喊漲、</p>
<h3>生活程度與生活費用</h3>
<p>— 木訥</p>
<p>何謂生活程度Standard　of　Living何謂生活費用Cost　of　Living？生活程度是「某經濟主體在某時間某空間所習用的必需品，安適品，和便利品的品質與數量的總稱，」簡單的說，生活程度是，「某個人或團體日常生活中　用程度的高下」，譬如有甲乙丙三人，甲每天飲牛乳一品脫（Pint），乙每天飲牛乳半品脫，丙每天飲豆漿半品脫，那末因為牛乳的品質比豆漿優，一品脫的質量較半品脫多，所以他們三人的生活程度就順次為甲最高，乙次之，丙最低。至於生活費用，可以說是生活程度的具體化或貨幣成本化，它的決定，係以日常消耗品的貨幣代價為依據，換句話說，生活費用是「某經濟主體在某時間某空間所習用的必需品安適品和便利品的貨幣代價之總和」，以前例來說，假定牛乳的價格是每品脫一元，豆漿的價格是每品脫五角，那末甲乙丙三人每天生活的支出順次為一元，五角，二角五分，也就是他們的生活費用，甲為最多，乙次之，丙最少。</p>
<p>在同時間同空間下，因為物品的價格和物品的質量是成正比增減的，所以生活費用的多少也能與生活程度的高低相一致，它們之間唯一的區別，祇是生活程度是以效用為依據的抽象名詞，生活費用是以貨幣代價為根據的具體名詞而已。可是物價是因時因地而不同的，所以生活程度與生活費用在不同的時間不同的空間下也就發生了差別，舉個簡單的例子來說：</p>
<p>年份　每年食米量總買價</p>
<p>民國廿五年　國米三石三十元</p>
<p>民國廿九年洋米二石半二百元</p>
<p>由於米價的狂漲，薪水階級某甲的食米到了暫代國米，每天的二飯一粥改成二粥一飯了，所以不論以食米的品質來說或是以數量來說，民國二十九年都比民國二十五年低落了許多，也就是說某甲的生活程度已較以前降落了不少，可是某甲每年食米的支出，反自三十元狂漲而　二百元，換句話說，就是某甲的生活費反比以前增加了將近六倍。由上例，我們可以很明顯的看出：生活費用在不同的時間下，不但不一定能與生活程度同其步伐，有時甚且背道而馳，至於在不同的空間下，那末因為同品質同數量的物品的價格未必盡同，致使生活費用與生活程度不能正比伸縮，更是明顯，這裏不再多說。</p>
<p>總之，由於物價與幣值不是固定不變的，所以在不同的時間不同的空間下，生活費用的增加未必就即生活程度高抬的表示，在目今的情况下，一般人民的生活費用雖然已較戰前激增，但是因為物價的上漲更多，所以大眾的生活程度不但沒有抬高，反在慘落之中，因此在今日高呼生活程度高漲，實在是誤用了名詞，因為事實上戰後一般人民的生活已較戰　困苦得多了！</p>

<h3>職業　他鄕遇故知</h3>
<p>— 落英</p>
<p>一個陽光和煦的星期日的下午，我獨自在街上閒走，藉以消除胸中的愁慮。微風吹拂到身上，的確帶了些春天的氣息，我感到興奮，臉上有着一種莫名的感覺。</p>
<p>突然，迎回來了一個似曾相識的靑年；當我的視綫閃過他的面上時，他忽　現出一種恐懼的神情，竭力想逃避，但是我並不怕冒昧，走過去就拍着他的肩膀很謙和地說：</p>
<p>「惠民兄！久違了！」</p>
<p>「啊…啊…××兄！你好？」他邊說邊點着頭，而上像是很窘的樣子。</p>
<p>旣然是他鄕遇故知，少不得問一聲現在在那裏的問詁。</p>
<p>「唉！」他輕輕地嘆口氣：「不瞞老兄說，我現在已失業了，而且失業以來，已一年多了，雖各處請人設法，到如今遼是石沉大海，我眞…。」他的頭垂着，似乎有說不出的苦痛。</p>
<p>他是我小學時代的同學，巳是很多年不見了，瘦長的面龐，很愛說話。分手後，聽說他是到上海學生意的，進的是綢緞莊。以後我們並沒有　過一次信，我也幾乎把他忘掉了，今日的偶遇，眞是夢中也想不到的。</p>
<p>我們轉一個灣，一陣和暖的風吹來，我又關心地問起他的住處來。</p>
<p>「暫時借宿在一個較遠的親戚家裏，他們也是很窮苦的，我不好意思再在他家坐吃，所以…，」他頓了一頓，終於鼓着勇氣說下去：「我現在拜了一位先生，今天的夜飯也只好厚着面皮到他那裏去揩油一頓了，我……。」</p>
<p>「先生？誰？」我不等他說完，連忙問他。他却笑起來了，最後他正經地對我說。。「吿訴你，就是在××路那裏的屋相先生。」</p>
<p>「哦！」我開始詫異起來，但是同情心終於勝過懷疑的心理。「惠尺！你好像是……。」</p>
<p>「我並不自甘墮落，實在叫沒有辦法，將來我一定要想別的路走的，現在還祇得硬着頭皮苦幹一下。」他撿着　辯着，說話時很氣急。</p>
<p>大家沉默了一會，他向我要了個通信處，又說：「有空到我那邊去談談。」</p>
<p>在十字路口，我們分了手，我關心地對他說：「祝你努力，並望你在最近能尋到一個較適當的職位。」他眼淚也快流下來了，哽咽地吐出三個字：「謝謝你！」</p>
<p>我看他拖着沉車的脚步走去。暖和的風吹起他的衣角。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>左手人的好處</h3>
<p>— 嵐毓</p>
<p>我訊得以前在雜誌上看到過好幾篇關於左手人的文章，因而得到了很多很實用的知識：譬如我將來養了一個兒子，發覺他兩三歲以後開始愛用左手拿糖吃，拿東西玩的時候，我就決不會偏要强迫他學大多數的人用右手，因此而使他視覺或聽覺變得遲鈍，或竟變得口吃。</p>
<p>最近在家裏翻舊雜誌，又看到了一篇關於左手人的短文，有趣得很，我自己和一個左手人曾照着在震且大學運動塲上以足球鬥柱為目標做了一次實騐，結果認為上面所說的話千眞萬確。現在把它譯之如下：</p>
<p>「假使你是個左手人，你沒有理由說這是你的不便宜的地方。反之，你還的確比大多數的右手人有利呢。照最近的科學硏究，知道左手人是唯一的能走直路的人，現在已發覺沒有一個右手人能對着一個顯著的目標，不需記號，一直走五百碼遠。右手人走起來向左偏得很利害，他的路綫成了一個頂點在左邊的弧形。</p>
<p>如果沒有星辰或其他的標記，叫一個右手人在沙漠裏「一直向前走」，大的二十四小時後，他一定同到他的出發點了。這就是在沙漠中迷失路途的人們，會突然發覺自己已回到前幾天已到過的地方了的緣故。科學到現在還不能解釋這事實，這事實或許是由於我們神經系中至今還未被想出的特質吧。只有一種人能够一直走，這就是左手人。</p>
<p>有一個步兵的指揮官說，當黑夜在陌生的地方行軍的時候，假使有左手人的話，他總讓他走在隊伍的左側，然後才能　信方向的一直無偏倚。</p>
<p>現在英國和意大利在東非正打得很利害，我想起以前駐在上海的英國兵中，有一個綽號「黃毛」的，足球踢得很好，尤善於用左脚踢，不知道他的手是否也是左手比右手靈些？如果是的話，假使他到了非洲的沙漠中，總該老走在隊伍的左側了吧！</p>
<h3>職業病</h3>
<p>— 芝蕙</p>
<p>美國俄萊貢大學醫學博士沙夏斯，發表了一個有趣味的報告，據他調查二百個患着罕見的乳癌症的男病人，（在一九三八年一年中，美國死於乳癌者婦女共一萬四千三百十五人，男子僅一百四十五人），結果發現內中有不少是木匠與鞋匠，這是因為他們在工作時，常以工具或其他工作物緊緊靠住胸前之故。此外郵差因胸部常受所掛皮包的壓迫，故也有患此病者。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>秋海棠不住的搓着雙手，心裏亂得一些計較也沒有。</p>
<p>「我還聽得下面帳房裏的人說，沈麻子和警察局也有交情，即使他的傷能够好，趙老二多少也得吃幾年官司…。」趙四張大了一雙銅鈴眼說。</p>
<p>人到急難的時候，可以想到的第一個救星永遠總是自己平日最敬愛或是最信服的人，於是秋海棠便立刻想到了袁紹文。</p>
<p>「不知道七爺現在可曾回來沒有？」</p>
<p>趙四不就回答，仰着一張肥臉，先自默想了三四分鐘；突然把手往右腿上一拍，疲乏的臉上，頓時便透出了幾許笑意來。</p>
<p>「七爺也許還沒有回京，但三爺却說不定就在道兒呢！」</p>
<p>「怎麼，三爺？」秋海棠茫然地問。</p>
<p>「不錯，就是袁鎭守使啊！」趙四彷彿很得意地說：「這件事你大概還不曾知道咧！吿訴你吧！三爺在天津是也有個公館的。』</p>
<p>像袁鎭守使那樣一個驕奢淫佚的軍閥，即使趙四說他在全中國各大城市都有公館，秋海棠也是決不會覺得詫異的。</p>
<p>「可是他要是眞在道裏的話，為什麼咱們來了十多天，沒有見他一次呢？」這一點是秋海棠所不解的。</p>
<p>但趙四也答覆不出來，只能含糊着回答：</p>
<p>「所以是說不定啊！」</p>
<p>「那有什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>「但咱們也不妨分頭辦事，」趙四顯得很幹練地說：「你一面儘管打電報去找七爺，我回頭就去打聽二爺的公館，假使碰到運氣好，恰巧給我們找上，那不是就有了救星嗎？」</p>
<p>秋海棠聽他這麼一說，也不覺略略寬慰些</p>
<p>「今兒要睡覺是不成了！」趙四站起，望着窗外才透出的太陽光，打了一個呵欠。（四三）</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>「仙樂街」</h3>
<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>所謂「仙樂街Tin　Pan　Alley」，就是美國紐約音樂家的一個發祥地，雖然其中也有不少人老死而名不彰的。本片寫兩個歌譜出版家的翰潘恩與賈克奥凱和一對歌星愛麗絲費與蓓蒂葛蘭寳中間的羅漫絲。雖則故事的本身，除了男女羅漫新以外，便沒有什麼了。但這羅漫絲却頗感動人，年靑的觀衆看了沒有不迥腸盪氣的。愛麗絲費為了的翰過於重視歌曲而忽略了對自己的愛情，遂一怒而走倫敦，的翰失去了愛麗絲費，他的歌便沒有人請敎，窮途潦倒，適値第一次世界大戰爆發，便和賈克一同去當丘八。後來開到倫敦，會見愛麗絲費，可是這時她已經有了未婚夫，的翰只得垂頭喪氣地走了。但愛麗絲費舊情難捨，千方百計地趕到碼頭上去送別，二人難解難分，愛麗絲費最後對他說：「我等你」，直到約翰凱旋歸來，愛麗絲費唱着他的歌去歡迎他，這齣「仙樂街」才在樂聲悠揚之中完結。</p>
<p>這故事，較同型的「紅花艷曲」，自然要動人得多。就是「紅花艷曲」中的穿挿，這裏也有。譬如片中愛麗絲費和蓓蒂葛蘭寳在倫敦戲院裹所演的「阿刺伯酋長」，極盡絢爛富麗的能事，「紅花艷曲」中那對跳踢躂舞的傢伙，也在這裏大顯身手，跳得確實新奇而且有勁；自然，這些都是够興奮刺激的，尤其是愛麗絲費和蓓蒂葛蘭寳半裸着身子，載歌載舞出來的時候，更覺得美麗絕倫。</p>
<p>但我看來，全劇最精彩地方，倒還是碼頭送別一幕，愛麗絲費和的翰久別重逢，兩人禁不住熱烈地擁抱着，接着是四目相視，兩人肚裏的心事，都從眼睛裏傳達出來，愛麗絲費和的翰的內心表演，都够　刻，那種盈盈欲語，依依不捨的神情，實在太感人了。</p>
<p>蓓蒂葛蘭寳戲雖不多，但給予觀衆以深刻的印象。她和愛麗絲費同時出塲，在舞蹈的時候，她比愛麗絲費史動人。約翰潘恩的戲，演得很穩練；賈克奥凱十分精彩，是全劇最好的個配角。導演雖沒有特別出色的地方，但全劇的調子，輕快簡潔，沒有片刻的鬆懈與沉悶。</p>
<h3>銀國美女荒</h3>
<p>— 土土</p>
<p>好萊塢影城的許多權威製片人都覺得缺乏純美的女演員已成為極煩惱的問題，各影片公司雖搜羅得不少美貌動人的女郞，而使好萊塢成為美女的集中地，但講究純美，在她們中間仍難以尋覔，因而大起恐慌。</p>
<p>米高梅的美女搜集員在尋求四十四個純美的女子充標準的齊格飛歌舞女郞」時，也有純　難求之感。五百多個然心的應微女郞請求審查，僅四十五人入選，但這些入選的，也祗是試上鏡頭的初步合格者而已，共中多數還須在最後選擇中被淘汰，於此可見好萊塢製片當局選材的嚴格和審愼的一般。</p>
<p>製片人潘德魯·白曼和名導演勞勃·里昂納所合訂的女子標準是：身高五呎七吋，過高或過矮皆在摒棄之例。祇身高一項，就有如此苛刻的規定，其他條件，自更嚴謹。成羣的年靑女郞，想投入好萊塢的懷抱，而被拒於銀色的門外，好萊塢有其不得已的苦衷啊。</p>

<h3>血雨瓊苑</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>小序</p>
<p>談到歷史上治亂興亡的陳迹，往往有一二女子點綴其間，如姑蘇臺畔的西施，華淸宮裏的貨妃。所以一般儒生繩墨之論，每痛斥美人為禍水，好似女色眞足以亡國；甚至把紅顏翠眉，視若洪水和蛇蠍，這豈非婦女界的大不幸嗎？共實，在往昔男權中心時代，國家存亡安危的關鍵，都把握在男子手裏，而以帝王萬乘之尊，專制淫威之下，何求不得？偏偏逢着不愛江山愛美人的風流大子，貪戀着聲色之樂，忘記了自己的地位，忽略了所掌的朝政，遂使敵國外患，內亂隱憂，乘時而起。除了越王所獻的西子，又當別論。其他的，自己的命運也被握在人家手裹，何嘗知道什麼國家興亡的事。况儘有憂深思遠，關心國事的女子，無奈人微言輕，無裨於時，如蜀國花蕊夫人「君王城上豎降旗，妾生深宮那得知，十四萬人齊解甲，更無一個是男兒。」之詩，其語又是何等的沉痛！唉！美人不幸而生於亂世，遭逢非常，演出的往往有非他們自己所能知道或是願意的，而人家却就輕輕地把亡　的罪名移到女子身上去了。坦白地說，芙蓉卓女之顏，楊柳小蠻之舞，人非木石，孰能無情？君王好色，士大夫好色，坐皇比，握虎符者亦何嘗不好色？但若能如孟子所謂：「王如好色，與百姓同之，於王例有？」，而詩二白篇　以關唯，窈窕淑女，亦可寤寐求之了。這並非是做書的代女子辯護。反之如聶隱紅錢之流，良玉雲英之儔，夫人城萬夫莫開，娘子軍千人辟易，歷史上可指的也很多。何况還有些無名女傑呢？當中原板蕩，外侮侵陵之秋，一般士大夫每多脅息兵刃下，喪失他們丈夫之氣，臨難失節，靦顏事仇，父何責於女子？而痛哭六軍，衝冠一怒，武人的昏愚徇私，遂演出引狼入室的悲劇，這禍又豈是夫人自己所想望而成的呢？且蓮子心苦，別有隱衷，這其間的痴心熱腸，又豈輸於一般殺身成仁的志十豪傑呢？山海關畔，徒留汚痕；昆明池邊，尙賸艷蹟，然而在這汚辱之痕，香艷之蹟裏頭，儘有不少貞潔熱烈的瓊葩，在刀光血雨下掙扎着，奔走着，要想燦爛地開放出復興之花來。事之不成，天也。英雄固不可以成收論，執筆之徒，豈能無言？把來渲染着，連級着，一一寫將出來，供今人快讀，恐也不僅可作酒　茶餘的消遣吧。</p>

<h3>The Pacific Crisis Intensifies: Thai-Vietnamese Negotiations Approach Final Stage. Japanese Mediation Proposals Contain a "Veiled Ultimatum." Deadline Passed Last Midnight Without French Response</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to responsible sources, the French government may not respond to Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute tonight. As of 6:00 PM today, the French side has not sent any official note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, nor has there been any indication of a future agreement. Overseas reports that Japan issued an ultimatum expiring at midnight today are not true. Reliable sources indicate that the Japanese government hopes to receive a concrete response from the French side tomorrow. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London - According to sources here, the timing of Japan's withdrawal of its residents from Vietnam and the serious crisis in the Tokyo mediation conference coincide, indicating that Japan is preparing to gain freedom of action. Japan's intervention clearly demands a substantial price. It is now rumored that a major obstacle has arisen, and the public is paying close attention to whether the Vietnam issue will lead to a Pacific war. (28th)</p>
<p>London - The attitude of the Vichy government towards Japan's latest proposal for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese dispute remains unclear. This afternoon, a cabinet meeting was held under the chairmanship of Marshal Pétain to discuss the situation. Deputy Premier and Navy Minister Darlan has reportedly postponed his trip to Paris to attend the meeting. The outcome is currently unknown. Last night, a government spokesman said that the Vichy government has set the maximum limit of concessions. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to responsible sources, the peace proposal put forward by Japan in its capacity as mediator in the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute is considered by Japan to be the final condition for mediation. The only options for both Thailand and Vietnam are to accept this plan or reject it completely. "Nichinichi Shimbun" summarized dispatches from Vichy and Vietnam, believing that the French authorities are inclined to reject the Japanese proposal, and that "as a result of a threatening attitude from a third party, it has requested assistance from elements within Vietnam who support de Gaulle." Although the Vietnamese authorities agree to some points of the Japanese proposal, they generally hold very different views. At the same time, only eighteen hours remain until the deadline for Thailand and Vietnam to accept the Japanese mediation proposal. Tokyo newspapers prominently report that the French side has not yet formally notified Japan of its attitude, but it is heard that Thailand has notified Japan that it can accept the proposal put forward by Japan on February 24th. The French side remains silent on the Japanese proposal. Well-informed observers unanimously believe that the Japanese proposal is of a final nature. Although the deadline for accepting the proposal has not been formally stipulated, it is generally understood that the Japanese government expects Vietnam to accept or reject it before midnight today. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Saigon - Authoritative sources today confirmed that Vietnam had received a "veiled ultimatum" from Japan and Thailand, with a deadline expiring at midnight today. A Japanese official here told a United Press reporter that a large number of Japanese naval forces are currently moving south. Authoritative sources also stated that Japanese troops in northern Vietnam are currently being reinforced. In Tokyo (Tokyo of Vietnam), the Japanese air force has been greatly reinforced yesterday. A Japanese official told a United Press reporter that Tokyo has 2,000 Japanese soldiers, Hanoi has a large Japanese air force, and Haiphong and southern Vietnam have Japanese warships, so Vietnam must accept the latest demands of Thailand and Japan. Although all indications here suggest that the final moment is approaching, most well-informed sources believe that some compromise will be reached at the last minute to prevent an outbreak. French sources said today that they believe the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute talks in Tokyo will inevitably fail because the positions of Japan and Thailand are extremely unreasonable. Well-informed sources also said that Vietnam may fight with more than one country, but if Japan goes beyond diplomatically supporting Thailand, Singapore and China are not far away. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Vichy Authorities State: Concessions Have Limits</p>
<p>Vichy - A government spokesman commented on the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire negotiations, saying that the French government has decided on the maximum limit of concessions and cannot concede another inch. The spokesman also said that, according to the Franco-German armistice agreement, France has the right to protect its overseas colonies and must comply with it. According to reports from Shanghai, the claim that Japan's conditions presented to France and rejected by France are Japan's final conditions is now being called an exaggeration here. United Press has learned that French Deputy Premier Darlan notified U.S. Ambassador Leahy on Saturday that France needs war materials to maintain the integrity of Vietnam, and hopes that the United States can sell aircraft, war equipment, etc., and deliver them promptly. It is heard that Washington has not yet responded, but U.S. Secretary of State Hull had previously refused to transport aircraft and war materials to Vietnam. The French Ministry of Propaganda said that Vietnam is effectively under blockade. "We have too few aircraft and troops, and our navy has only one cruiser and several gunboats, but we can still resist the Thai offensive. Our air force has performed better than Thailand, and our navy has also defeated Thai warships. In fact, we have defeated the Thai offensive." The official said that as a result of the recent meeting between Vietnamese Governor Decoux and French military commander in Vietnam Mordant, France is prepared for any eventuality. Each day the current deadlock continues increases the danger. According to France's maximum concessions, Thailand can obtain the entire area west of the Mekong River in Laos province, a narrow strip in northern Cambodia, and the western region, but France cannot cede Pakse and towns east of the Mekong River. France does not intend to propose any new plan, and it should be up to Japan and Thailand to decide what to do. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the negotiations between French and Thai representatives in Tokyo, officials here are keeping silent, insisting that at this stage of the negotiations, all parties concerned should adopt an extremely cautious attitude. Foreign reports that have a different effect are a distortion that erases the facts. It is hoped that the French and foreign press will not be deceived. In short, France's position on the border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam remains unchanged. The current border between Vietnam and Thailand was demarcated by the 1907 treaty, and the Thai government has repeatedly stated that it cannot be changed. The land returned to Vietnam by Thailand under this treaty originally belonged to the Vietnamese Eastern Cambodian state and was only occupied by Thailand in 1867. When Thailand returned this land to Vietnam in 1907, the border demarcated by both sides was quite favorable to Thailand, and the Vietnamese side had given various benefits. Up until June 12, 1940, France and Thailand signed a non-aggression pact based on the 1507 treaty. At this time, although France has accepted Japanese mediation, France's treaty position has not changed as a result. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Welles Receives Japanese and Soviet Ambassadors Separately</h3>
<p>Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles separately received Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky yesterday afternoon. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles' separate receptions of the Soviet and Japanese ambassadors have aroused considerable speculation in foreign circles, believing that there is a new tension in the Far East. It is reported that Oumansky is quite disappointed that the United States has not been able to resolve the restrictions on the Soviet Union's goods. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Farewell, Dr. Currie</h3>
<p>Dr. Currie, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt, and economic expert Dr. Depre, came to China with an investigative mission. After three weeks, he completed his work and flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong the day before yesterday, and will soon return to the United States tomorrow. Based on the earnestness and sincerity expressed by Currie before his departure, it is known that this trip will certainly report the state of China's finances and economy to President Roosevelt. It is expected that American aid to China will sweep away the previous hesitation and become more active and clear, which is truly a blessing for both China and the United States. Only when China and the United States stand on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean can the peace of the Pacific be guaranteed. If there is any imbalance, it will inevitably form a situation of uneven distribution. The Americans have concerns about the West, and both countries will have no peaceful day. Only when they share weal and woe can they help each other in times of difficulty. Understanding this, Dr. Currie's trip was not in vain.</p>
<p>According to international practice, the way to treat envoys from other countries must be commensurate with the meaning of their mission. "I have fine wine, feasting the guests," is praised by poets. If etiquette requires reciprocity, there must be entertainment. Envoys come from afar, and there must be grand gatherings. This is truly a trivial matter, but it is also human nature. Now, although Dr. Currie often said, "I am very grateful for the warm hospitality," in order to avoid directly answering questions about the investigation work, and expressed "If there were not so many banquets, I could have done more research," it is also heard that Dr. Currie completed his complex and complicated work in this very short period of time, and still gained ten pounds of weight before returning. Considering the purpose of entertaining foreign envoys, it is a matter of satisfaction for China, the host, to make them feel comfortable. Moreover, Dr. Currie's mission lies in collecting materials. It is heard that he has collected the materials he wanted to collect, and the fact that this complex material can be completed in a short period of time shows that the Chinese authorities' treatment of guests is not only a trivial matter of entertainment, but also that everything goes smoothly and they can achieve their goals. This cannot be achieved without a sound organization and flexible coordination. Dr. Currie was able to complete his mission because of this, which is also a sign that China's great cause of resistance and construction has been prepared with basic principles and strategies.</p>
<p>"China needs very little, and the United States wants to help a lot." Generally speaking, this seems strange, but it is gratifying. This is because China's inherent virtues are hard work and endurance, poor clothing and simple food. The reason why the war continues to fight repeatedly, the morale is unyielding, and the construction is simple and effective, and the results are doubled, are all based on inherent virtues. We really do not know what items are needed in very small quantities. Some of the things that have been mentioned are, in addition to the economy, new weapons such as aircraft and heavy artillery, which must be urgently needed from the United States. In terms of assistance, the passages of China's coastal ports are controlled by Japanese warships and artillery. Vietnam is also intimidated by the violence of the Japanese side, resulting in the closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The only route that can be relied on for assistance is the Burma Road, which is also being destroyed by the Japanese air force. Fortunately, the repair projects trained in China are unusually quick, and the transportation is continuous. However, if Japan advances south at full speed, spies on Malaya, and occupies the Dutch East Indies, the threat to the Burma Road will be even greater. Therefore, American aid to China should pay special attention to the speed and safety of the aid channels. This is one. Whether it is economy, transportation, military affairs, or machinery, they are all products of modern science. Only with skilled technicians can they achieve familiar results. Therefore, although the United States absolutely does not need to send troops to the Chinese front, how to allocate technical talents to China should be a consideration. This is another one. Dr. Currie will not find it difficult to understand the complex situation of China's economy. Looting is common, and the more urgent the changes in the situation, the deeper the economic damage. Therefore, the New York Free Pound was able to be properly handled by the British. However, China still has no proper way to deal with the Shanghai black market. Although the conversion of U.S. dollars into savings deposits has been a preliminary reorganization, the unpredictable conspiracies of the future are watching beside it and chasing after it. The United States has a surplus of gold and should find other ways to use it. Then, how to support China's legal tender to coordinate China's wartime economy is another one. We really do not know how many items China's authorities have suggested to Dr. Currie and others that are needed in addition to these few items. Even with these items, we are also happy to hear Dr. Currie's promise that China will never be disappointed. Moreover, China's assistance from the United States certainly cannot be without compensation. The way of compensation may follow the general commercial way. In China, which has always valued good faith, promises are the most reliable guarantee, and the general material guarantee conditions should be secondary in terms of method, and even unnecessary in nature. What China especially wants to repay the United States is: an unlimited commercial gateway, the long-term stability of the Pacific Ocean, the promotion and development of international justice and human civilization, the corresponding and enthusiastic friendship between the spirits of the Chinese and American peoples, the super-literary alliance of sharing weal and woe and jointly suppressing the strong, and the life-and-death friendship of guarding democracy. Before continuing to give China aid, have Dr. Currie and others felt that they have already received this kind of reward and returned?</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in Vietnam Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation at Any Time</p>
<p>Hanoi - All 400 Japanese residents in Vietnam are now hastily packing up and preparing to leave the country in accordance with the notice issued yesterday by the Japanese Consul-Generals in Hanoi and Saigon, ordering them to prepare for a full evacuation at any time. This is the second action in six months. The first evacuation order was issued on August 22 last year, just before France accepted Japan's request to station troops in Hanoi. According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, the French authorities in Vietnam are now complying with the resolution of the emergency meeting of military and political leaders convened by Vietnamese Governor Decoux on February 26. This resolution unanimously opposed the large-scale partition of Vietnam. Japanese observers said that the French authorities in Vietnam took this stance because they believed that Britain and the United States would prevent Japan from implementing the proposed solution to Thailand and Vietnam by coercive means. Observers all believed that if it were not for orders from Vichy or forced by a large Japanese army, the French authorities would not change this attitude. Observers also said that when Japan attempted to station troops in Vietnam last August, the French authorities used this delaying tactic to deal with it and relied on the power of Britain and the United States to prevent Japan from using force. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Osaka - According to news from here today, Osaka Shosen Kaisha has instructed all returning ships to prepare to load Japanese residents evacuated from Vietnam. The Bangkok Maru, which came to Japan from Bangkok via various ports in Vietnam today, and the Raplata Maru, which departed from Kobe yesterday and will arrive in Haiphong in eight days, have both been ordered to reserve cabins for Japanese residents evacuated from Vietnam. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Well-informed Japanese sources claimed that the success or failure of the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute conference will directly affect the French-Japanese economic talks on Vietnam, and may eventually affect the relationship between Vichy and Berlin. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Strengthening Defenses on the Burmese Border; Expansion of Singapore's Minefield</p>
<p>Singapore - People here today regard the situation in Vietnam as extremely serious because of the rumour that Japan has issued a real "veiled ultimatum," saying that if France does not accept it before midnight tonight, it will resort to coercive measures to implement the resolution. In view of France's public declaration yesterday that it will not make any more concessions, it seems difficult to imagine how these two opposing opinions will be reconciled. If a public conflict occurs, then given the delicate state of affairs in the Far East, it is not known what will happen. However, Singapore is confident that it can now cope with any emergency, and the recent acceleration of the deployment of defenses in Burma has also made great progress.

<p>Japanese Spokesman Ishii Claims No Ultimatum Was Given to Vietnam</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese government spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters this morning that the situation of the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is now very tense. "We are not engaged in a war of nerves. We are now making real preparations, but we have not given an ultimatum to the French side, because mediators cannot issue ultimatums." Ishii denied the rumour that nine Japanese warships had gone to Saigon, and did not confirm the news that Thailand had accepted Japan's final proposal, but said that Japan's final proposal could be regarded as an indication that Thailand had accepted it. Ishii admitted that Japan had promised to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity in return for the agreement concluded between Japan and Vietnam last year, allowing Japanese troops to be stationed in northern Vietnam. However, he then added in his reply that Japan suggested that Vietnam return land to Thailand, which is fully in line with the agreement. As for Japan's promise regarding land, it has nothing to do with the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. Ishii also said that the French ambassador visited Matsuoka at 2:00 PM yesterday and stayed for a long time, but refused to reveal the nature of the conversation. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Japan is Eager to Establish a Co-Prosperity Sphere and is Dissatisfied with France's Delaying Tactics</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that the Japanese government is now firmly opposed to Vietnam's attempt to delay accepting Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, because this prolonged delay will lead to interference by third parties in the East Asian co-prosperity sphere and will make Southeast Asia "Balkanized," refusing Japan's leadership in East Asia. The authorities have now issued an order to evacuate Japanese residents from Vietnam and ordered them to prepare to leave the country at noon on July 7, when the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire expires. It is said that this is a plan to prevent the overall situation from deteriorating. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Germany is Trying Hard to Win Over Japan; It is Rumored that Matsuoka Will Visit Berlin</p>
<p>New York - The discussions between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima in Berlin, and the news that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will soon go to Berlin, are regarded here as another indication that Germany is trying hard to win over Japan and wants it to join the war in accordance with the Tripartite Pact. Japan is also willing to only have a conflict with Britain when Britain's defeat seems inevitable, so that it can occupy as much of the Earth's area as possible without the need to conflict with the United States. The news from Tokyo yesterday made the United States pay attention to the statement issued by the Japanese spokesman on February 18, "We want to reiterate that the Tripartite Pact aims at peace," but the value of this kind of statement is not accepted by the United States. This can be seen from Bullitt's speech at the New York Foreign Publishing Industry Club last night. Bullitt said, "Love your neighbor as yourself. If you say this to Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists, you will only hear mockery. We cannot expect them to give honor or benevolence in dealing with us or any other country. Germany, Italy, and Japan have openly united against us in accordance with the alliance they concluded in Berlin five months ago." Bullitt did not speak in the capacity of a policy maker or ambassador. The State Department sent his speech to various newspapers, and the meaning can be imagined. Observers here are deeply convinced that the United States, both government and public, regards Japan as being in cahoots with Germany and Italy, and as a country that hates the freedom and democracy on which the United States was founded. Matsuoka's recent demands regarding Oceania, although later information from Tokyo has slightly explained them, have ultimately aroused widespread condemnation here, criticizing them as being arrogant and containing serious meanings, because when Matsuoka mentioned the living space of 800 million people, he was referring not to a few islands in the Pacific, but to a very vast area. The importance of this issue is so great that Matsuoka cannot express his personal opinions, so what he said must be the basis for the formulation of Japanese policy. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops are Extremely Active Near Hainan Island and Guangzhou. Naval Base Engineering is Careless; Preparations for a Southern Blitzkrieg are Incomplete.</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman said that Japanese troops preparing to advance south are extremely active near Hainan Island and Guangzhou. Japan is using Hainan Island as a base for advancing south, so it is strengthening the island, especially the defenses of Yulin Port at the southern end of the island. The Japanese army is also building new military supply depots and bases along the coast of Guangdong, including Dapeng Bay. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Chinese sources said that the Japanese naval base on Hainan Island, which is used as a springboard for advancing south, has been completed after twenty months of intensive work. There are three bases: Yulin Port in the south, Qinglan Port in the east, and Yangpu Port in the west. All three bases have airfields, hangars, factories, and oil pools. Some barracks have been modernized to accommodate German technical experts and military advisors. Military experts pointed out that no large naval base can be built within two years, and Japan lacks military materials and copper and iron, and is far from Hainan Island, so the engineering of these three bases must be very careless. The docks are quite large and can accommodate destroyers and light cruisers, and can be used for inspection and minor repairs. As for the Chinese rumour that there are 100,000 Japanese troops on Hainan Island, it is inevitable that it is an exaggeration. According to recent official news, there is one division and one brigade of Japanese troops on Hainan Island, with a total of 30,000 officers and soldiers. These soldiers are being guided by experts and receiving parachute training, and are practicing blitzkrieg, but they currently lack blitzkrieg equipment. It is heard that the necessary weapons are being shipped to the island from Japan. Chinese guerrillas are still active in Wenchang, Danxian, Qiongdong, Ding'an, and Chengmai. The Japanese army loses 200 people every month. Japanese warplanes, marines, and regular troops are still being continuously sent to the island, and new recruits recruited in the Chinese-occupied areas are currently being trained to supplement the Japanese army.

This order is hereby issued. (Telegraph from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Various Areas in Sichuan Province Celebrate Receiving Timely Rain</h3>

<h3>Lu Yonghuang Travels from Hong Kong to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Lu Yonghuang, the esteemed father of Xuan Nan, the deceased member and secretary-general of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, was summoned by the central government. He arrived in Hong Kong in the middle of this month and departed for Chongqing by plane yesterday. Before his departure, he gave a brief statement, saying that while saddened by his son Xuan Nan's sacrifice for the country, he also felt immensely honored. Xuan Nan, whose courtesy name was used, was born on the 29th day of the twelfth month in the year of Yiyou, three years before the founding of the Republic (1909). He was martyred on November 19th, 1940, at the age of thirty-two. He graduated from Shanghai College of Law and Politics in the summer of 1933 and worked briefly in a government ministry before going to Japan to study local autonomy at the graduate school of Waseda University. He returned to China in 1936 and served on the Local Autonomy Planning Committee of the Central Party Headquarters. Before the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), he established the International United Telegraph Agency to gather Japanese intelligence and contribute to the government's efforts. His news was accurate and highly regarded in the journalistic circles of Nanjing. He ceased operations when the National Government moved westward. Subsequently, he left Nanjing for Wuhan, where he and his comrades founded the National Diplomatic Association. After the retreat from Wuhan, he moved westward to Chongqing and continued to operate the National Diplomatic Association. Later, with the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he participated in the second session of the Party and Government Training Class at the Central Training Corps. After graduating, he was appointed by the central government as an executive member and secretary-general of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee and as a colonel-level inspector of the Three Principles of the People Youth Corps, as well as an inspector of the Party and Government Committee. He arrived in Shanghai in August 1939, and shortly after went to Nanjing to work. The responsibilities he shouldered were extremely heavy, and he suffered repeated setbacks. Unexpectedly, he was arrested at midnight on August 8th, 1940, and detained for a hundred days. Resisting stubbornly and refusing to yield, he was martyred at Yuhuatai, a suburb of Nanjing, on November 19th at Chenshi (7-9 AM). (Dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>Hog Bristle Prices Increased Separately</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Chongqing Provisional Municipal Council previously passed a resolution at its third general meeting requesting the government to protect industry and commerce and strive for the international market for hog bristle exports.

The Trade Commission will purchase according to the announced prices to encourage export trade. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Silk Production in Sichuan Province Increases</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Before the war, 80% of the raw silk produced annually in Sichuan Province was sold to the United States. Currently, 50% of all raw silk exported from Sichuan is purchased by Rangoon, and the rest is sold in New York. In the past two years, the amount of Sichuan silk exported to British Burma has increased significantly. The highest annual production in Sichuan is around 30,000 dan (approx. 1,500 metric tons). Because American merchants require better quality silk, the same amount of silkworm cocoons produces one-third less raw silk when processed for export to the US market compared to when processed for sale in the Burmese market.

<h3>British Forces Capture Nakfa in East African Battle; Rumor that German Mechanized Units Supporting Italy Have Suffered Setbacks in North Africa</h3>
<p>Khartoum. British forces have occupied Kirmt, thirty miles north of Corren in Italian Eritrea, without encountering any resistance. Nakfa, fifty miles north of Kirmt, has also been captured by British forces attacking from Cor Cob. British forces captured Karora on February 9th and began the southern offensive on Corren. They have now occupied Kirmt, more than 200 miles from their starting point in Karora. No news has been reported from other fronts in Eritrea and Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>

An RAF communiqué issued yesterday, describing the air force's assistance to the army's advance on the northeastern Italian lines, stated that RAF bombing of enemy concentrations and supply depots in the Corren area had been quite effective. The motor vehicle depot at Asabemada was bombed, and ammunition dumps and other targets near Massawa were attacked.

<p>Cairo. The Nile Army has repelled German mechanized units that were attempting to prevent the British advance and have advanced further from Benghazi. Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were almost entirely in British hands last night. The outcome of the initial clash between British and German forces in Africa is highly secretive and has not yet been revealed. However, it is claimed here that the British were completely victorious last night. The German mechanized units, which had repeatedly defeated Allied forces in Europe at the beginning of the war, were defeated by the long-serving Central Army. According to British officers, the British army is "eager to capture the German army alive." British forces in Eritrea recently occupied Kirmt and Nakfa, so their northern force is now less than fifty miles from the besieged railway center of Corren. People in Cairo believe that General Graziani, the Italian commander-in-chief in Africa, will be traveling from Tripoli to Tunis. His luggage has already arrived in Tunis, so it is believed that Graziani will return there. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Washington. The International News Service learned last night that the US government firmly believes that control over Italy has fallen into German hands. According to private sources received by the US government, although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still the leader of the Italian government, actual control has fallen into the hands of the German secret police and the German army. Senior officials in Washington believe that this development is one of the most significant events in the war because it is sufficient to hinder the victorious advance of the British Nile Army in Libya. It is believed here that one of the main purposes of the German takeover of Italy is to prevent a revolution. It has been reported that demonstrations often occur in Italian cities, but these have now stopped, indicating that a powerful authority has suppressed all traitors. News has spread that British and German forces have come into contact in North Africa, which is of great interest here. It is generally believed that this clash, since the landing of the large German army and the demotion of the Italian High Command to a dependency, is a prelude to the increased warfare between the British and German forces. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Rome. The Roman "Regime Fascista" newspaper reported yesterday that the appearance of German forces in North Africa demonstrates two points: first, that Britain does not control the Mediterranean because the German forces came via the Mediterranean, and second, that there is complete unity of the Axis powers. The newspaper said: "The appearance of well-organized German forces in Africa shows that the British claim to control the Mediterranean is entirely fabricated." The newspaper is owned by Foreign Minister Ciano. The newspaper went on to say: "The transport of a fully equipped German force shows that maritime transport is very smooth. The news of German forces in Africa also destroys rumors that Germany only wants to take care of its own interests and achieve its own victory, and that Germany would only pay attention to Africa when it was occupied by a large number of British forces. The two leaders of the Axis powers have said that they have only one front, one war, and a common victory, and this is indeed the truth." (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters war correspondent reports that South African and Dominion troops have crushed an entire Italian division on the Juba River. Three Italian brigade commanders were captured, two of whom had been decorated in World War I. Most of the prisoners taken were South African natives, numbering three thousand. A unit from Natal captured more enemy troops at Chilieba than their own numbers. Another unit from Transvaal captured 300 enemy troops. The dense jungle on both sides of the Juba River is full of dead Italian soldiers. The number of prisoners taken at Chilieba is currently difficult to count. These prisoners are grateful for the good treatment they are receiving, but they do not believe the news that Tobruk, Benghazi, and Mijiga have fallen. It is reported that the Italian side transferred two elite regiments from Harar, Abyssinia, to fight at Juba, but they were also annihilated. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Rumor that British-Turkish Consultations Have Led to Agreement; Adopting a Policy of Mutual Assistance to Cope with Contingencies; Military Experts Continue to Discuss Technical Issues</h3>
<p>Istanbul. It was stated here last night that if Germany were to pass through Bulgaria and threaten the Dardanelles or other important British-Turkish interests, Britain and Turkey have already united to provide mutual assistance and cooperate diplomatically. It is believed that Britain and Turkey have adopted a unified policy to cope with any eventuality, which was achieved during the repeated meetings between British Foreign Secretary Eden, British Chief of Staff Dill, and Turkish representatives here. It is rumored that the agreement contains precise provisions on areas where Turkey will not tolerate foreign activity. We can recall that on Monday, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that "Turkey cannot turn a blind eye to foreign activities in certain areas," but the Foreign Minister did not clarify these areas. It is believed that the boundaries set by Eden, Dill, and the Turkish government also include Thessaloniki. After the conclusion of these talks, it is believed that Eden and Dill will meet with the military attaché of Yugoslavia stationed in Turkey, with the aim of enabling Turkey and Yugoslavia to take unified action against Axis aggression in the Balkans. Eden was welcomed wherever he appeared in public. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Ankara. It is said that the talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish officials were extremely satisfactory. Were it not for the precise wording of the communiqué issued after the two sides decided to hold meetings and consultations, there would be no need for continued talks. Eden is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Inonu tonight. Eden departs from Adana Airport tonight, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps had a general conversation with Eden this morning. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Istanbul. The Turkish "Ulus" newspaper published an article warmly welcoming British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial Chief of General Staff General Dill. It is reported that the Turkish people respectfully salute these two outstanding representatives of Britain. The welcome given to Eden and Dill in Istanbul is an expression of the friendship of Turkey's goodwill and trust in Britain. Britain is a very influential factor in Turkey's destiny. Eden is a politician who will play an important role in British imperial history, and he is known to have always advocated British-Turkish friendship. The Turkish people sincerely hope that the arrival of the two honored guests will not only feel joyful but will also yield positive results that benefit both Britain and Turkey. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The "Arriba" newspaper here commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden's activities in Istanbul, saying that although Eden was received by important members of the Turkish government, one thing that cannot be ignored is that before Eden arrived in Turkey, German Ambassador von Papen hosted a banquet for the Turkish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and other cabinet members and showed the film "Victory on the Western Front." Between the diplomatic secrets in Eden's briefcase and the German film, the future of the Near East will be decided. But no matter whether the new front organized by Britain in the Balkans is successful, it can never change the fate of the war. It can be asserted that in the history of all countries, geographical factors occupy an extremely important position, and this is also the case this time. But no matter how the situation in the Mediterranean develops, it is the Western Front, not the Eastern Front, that will determine the fate of the war.

<h3>British Minister to Bulgaria Warns Bulgaria that if it Allows German Forces to Infiltrate, Britain Will Immediately Prepare to Attack</h3>
<p>Sofia. According to unconfirmed reports, German tank units crossed the Danube River from Romania early this morning. Before this news had spread, British Minister to Bulgaria Rendel issued a stern warning to Bulgaria, indicating that British diplomatic relations with Bulgaria were close to breaking down. It is reported that the German troops who are said to have infiltrated Bulgaria are "not just a few thousand, but hundreds." The British military is also preparing to attack immediately. Officials here have neither confirmed the rumor of German troops entering Bulgaria nor commented on the British Minister's warning. The British Minister's remarks have increased belief that Britain may launch an offensive in Bulgarian airspace or on Bulgarian land immediately to prevent Germany from advancing towards Greece. At the same time, it is heard that heavy snow at the Bulgarian-Romanian border may hinder the expected German advance. Rendel has stated that Britain will not hesitate to declare war and has hinted that Britain can defeat Germany. It has been pointed out that Germany is adopting a strategy of gradual infiltration rather than a large-scale invasion in order to prevent Britain from having a pretext for war and to stand by and watch Germany tighten its control over Bulgaria, but Britain cannot tolerate this. Rendel said that German newspapers, transportation, the army, and the police are all virtually under Nazi control. He added, "When British officials leave Bulgaria, that will be the beginning of the tragedy." (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland. Regarding the claim that German troops have entered Bulgaria, although it is being widely circulated in London, Berlin has repeatedly and emphatically denied it. Observers here generally believe that, given the firmness of the German denial, it is credible that German troops will not take action against Bulgaria for at least several weeks. German diplomatic activities in the Balkans are extremely active, so they can use methods other than military action to promote their current policies without resorting to force immediately. Moreover, a large number of German troops are currently gathered in Romania. If the German command believes it is necessary, they can order these troops to move south and attack Greece at any time. However, it is difficult to grasp what intentions the German military authorities currently have, so when predicting their future actions, people should not stick to preconceived notions based on the above denials. For example, the "Lausanne Gazette's" correspondent in Berlin cabled, "It is not entirely impossible that German troops will suddenly attack Greece via Yugoslavia to outflank the British Near East forces." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>London. The British Broadcasting Corporation announced tonight that the British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, stated in Sofia that the number of German "technicians" infiltrating Bulgaria is increasing daily. The diplomatic relations between Britain and Bulgaria are on the verge of breaking down. If British diplomatic personnel withdraw, Bulgaria will become a war zone, which would be extremely detrimental to the country. It is hoped that the country will not follow in the footsteps of Romania. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Exchange of Ratifications Between Hungary and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Budapest: Following the arrival of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in the Hungarian capital, he proceeded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to exchange ratification documents concerning the Treaty of Friendship between the two nations, which was concluded last December, with Foreign Minister Bárdossy. Regent Prince Paul was also present at the event. Additionally, Foreign Minister Bárdossy hosted a banquet last night in honor of Marković, during which both ministers delivered congratulatory speeches. Bárdossy stated that the relations between the two nations have been based on friendship and cooperation, which is highly beneficial to the maintenance of peace in Southeastern Europe. This spirit of cooperation is reaffirmed by the Treaty of Friendship concluded between the two parties, which creates a favorable atmosphere that is not only indispensable for building a new European order but also contributes to the current policies of the friendly nations of Germany and Italy. In response, Minister Marković stated that as Bárdossy had said, the Treaty of Friendship concluded between the two nations is highly beneficial to the maintenance of peace in Southeastern Europe. Under the cooperation of the two major neighboring nations of Germany and Italy, the commitment to peace is a blessing for both nations and even the entire Southeastern Europe. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Following the exchange of ratification documents for the Treaty of Friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia, observers here have commented that regardless of future developments in the Balkan Peninsula, the two nations seem to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool. According to this treaty, both parties can benefit economically, as they can both strengthen their national defenses and increase production and trade. As Hungary has no direct access to the sea, its goods will be exported through the ports along the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, in turn, can trade with the Soviet Union through Hungary.

<h3>Dutch Residents in Japan Voluntarily Evacuate</h3>
<p>Batavia: According to official wireless communications, the tension in the Pacific has prompted some Dutch women and children to return from Japan. However, it is solemnly stated that this is not an official evacuation, as the Dutch East Indies government has not issued any advice or orders regarding evacuation. This is entirely voluntary. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Lull in Fighting in Albania</h3>
<p>Athens: The Greek Information Department states that the atmosphere on the Albanian front remains harsh, hindering large-scale military operations. However, Greek artillery continues to bombard enemy positions with success, and shells have exploded in Italian trenches, causing heavy damage. An Italian column in a certain area was hit, suffering severe casualties. The Greek air force continues to bomb military targets, depots, enemy columns en route, and concentrated motor transport.

<h3>Clues to Japanese Southern Advance Obtained from Admiral Oikawa's Documents; The Resulting Tensions in the Pacific; Alcott Elucidates the Cause and Effect</h3>
<p>The well-known news reporter Alcott published an article in the Continental Daily yesterday, entitled "Admiral Oikawa's Documents," analyzing the relationship between the Oikawa plane crash and the recent changes in the Far East situation in the past two or three weeks. His words reveal much that others have not. Now, his original text will be translated as follows: The arrival of the British ambassador to Shanghai reminds people of the various problems, opinions, coincidences, and the resulting tensions in the Far East in the past two or three weeks. My observations may be incorrect, but after reviewing the results, I believe that all the alarming events in the past two or three weeks, such as the reissuance of evacuation advisories by the United Kingdom and the United States, the arrival of Australian troops in Singapore, and the deaths of important Japanese figures such as Admiral Oikawa and Rear Admiral Suga in the Japanese plane crash in Guangdong earlier this month, are all related. To date, what happened at the time of the Japanese plane crash is still being debated. The Chinese side still insists that the plane was shot down by guerrillas, while the Japanese side claims that the plane crashed on its own. It is not important who obtained the bodies.</p>
<p>Chinese Side Obtains Oikawa's Documents</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is that the Chinese side claimed to have obtained documents from Oikawa's remains. According to reports from Chongqing, after examining these documents, it was discovered that Oikawa was flying south with his subordinates to participate in work related to the Japanese advance to the South. After the Chinese side released this news, no further extremely important news was transmitted. However, within the shortest time after the Japanese plane crash and Oikawa's death, several important events occurred. A few days after Oikawa's death, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Fadden made his shocking statement, claiming that the situation in the Pacific was serious. Also, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, canceled his trip to Hong Kong, and Shanghai received reports of considerable diplomatic activity in Chongqing. The Japanese plane crashed on February 5, but the news was not released until February 9. We know that the plane crashed in an area controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Other than that, it cannot be verified which side's view is correct. However, according to reliable foreign sources, the Chinese side did see the documents carried by Admiral Oikawa.</p>
<p>Important Measures Develop One After Another</p>
<p>The question that arises is whether the changes that have occurred in the past week have been triggered by the information in those documents. Several important figures believe this to be the case. For example, Fadden said that he had just received a report, which made him feel that the situation in the Pacific was serious. Fadden made this statement only three or four days after the news of Admiral Oikawa's death was released. Holland, for some declared reason, recalled the Dutch ships sailing in the sea to Manila. The Chizukawa Maru, not far from Manila Bay, also turned back halfway upon receiving a signal from the Corregidor US fortress. On February 14, the US State Department in Washington reiterated its evacuation advisory, ordering American expatriates in Shanghai and other Far East ports to evacuate. Subsequently, news came that mines had been placed in the Singapore Strait. According to the information I have obtained, the British started to lay mines in the strait after the news of Admiral Oikawa's death was released. Soon after Singapore buried mines, the Queen Mary and several other British ships suddenly arrived there, carrying about one division of Australian troops. Qualified observers believe that these Australian troops were originally destined for Egypt but suddenly landed in Singapore after receiving alarming news. A few hours later, the British authorities reiterated their previous order, advising British expatriates in Shanghai to evacuate.</p>
<p>Tokyo is Extremely Uneasy</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the above-mentioned events, Tokyo has been shrouded in an atmosphere of distress and anxiety. In fact, senior officials in the Japanese capital have shown signs of panic, which makes people believe that something bad must have happened, that is, the plan that they originally thought the world was unaware of was suddenly exposed. Later, they put forward some foolish suggestions for mediating the war, officially claiming to be "mediators for disputes in various parts of the world." Then they went back on their word, denying that they had made mediation proposals, and ultimately failed. Japan's implementation of its southern advance plan is no longer as rampant and clamorous as in the past because the United Kingdom and the United States have prepared. It is not known whether the war in the Pacific will be avoided because of this. The current fact is that the United Kingdom and the United States deeply feel that all the information they have is very important and cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, Senator George of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that he expects various developments in the Far East, and Fadden has repeatedly stated that although the current situation is not as alarming as in the past, it is still serious. I believe that when the truth behind the Far East tension in the past three weeks is finally revealed, it will be known that the Oikawa document incident has a considerable relationship with the tension in the situation.</p>
<h3>Extension of Shanghai West Special Police Establishment Period; Said to be Changed to the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>After the "Police Authority Agreement" in Shanghai West was signed on the 1st of last month, Chen Gongbo "appointed" Pan Zhijie as the "Director-General of the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters," and at the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council recommended Christopher as the "Deputy Director-General." The two parties negotiated on organizational issues. The "Headquarters" was originally scheduled to be established today. It is now learned that due to budget issues, it has not been resolved so far, and personnel issues have not been completely decided, so it is difficult to achieve it as scheduled. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily yesterday, Pan Zhijie has flown to Nanjing on the 25th to make contact with Nanjing, and Chen Gongbo also left Shanghai on the 28th, so the Shanghai West "Special Police Headquarters" may not be established for a while.</p>
<p>According to news from foreign sources, the "Special Police," which was originally scheduled to be established today, will be changed to March 15 because the meeting between "Director-General" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Director-General" Christopher has not ended as scheduled. It is heard that the list of more than 60 candidates for the last batch of "Special Police" recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday for approval, and then handed over to Chen Gongbo for "appointment." If there are no problems with the proposed candidates from both sides, the main problems in the negotiations between Pan Zhijie and Christopher will also be resolved, and the "Special Police" can be expected in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Daily Held Economic Symposium Yesterday to Discuss US-Japan War and the Future of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The situation in South Asia is becoming increasingly urgent. Shanghai is the main international market in the Far East, and its situation is particularly bad. In the event of a US-Japan war, what impact will the future of the Shanghai market have? What preparations should China's industrial, commercial, and financial circles make in advance? These are all issues that are currently of great concern to all sectors. In order to gather ideas and broaden their horizons, the local Sino-American Daily invited 18 well-known international affairs experts and economic affairs experts to hold a symposium at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the theme of "US-Japan War and the Future of the Shanghai Market." After the experts shared their insights, they had a thorough and precise analysis of the situation, and a sharp and accurate observation of the future. They also had important suggestions on the preparations that the industrial and commercial circles should make and the countermeasures that the government should take. The discussion lasted for four hours before everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Welsh National Day</h3>
<p>The Welsh British expatriates in this port will present flowers in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund at 8:30 this morning. At 6:30 in the evening, there will be a dinner at the auditorium at 1623 Avenue Road to celebrate the National Day together. Tomorrow, there will also be a service at the Suzhou Road Union Church, which is scheduled to start at 10:45 am. Sir George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, will also attend the flower presentation ceremony.</p>
<h3>Batch of Japanese Expatriates Retreating from Manila Passes Through Shanghai; It is Said that US-Japan Relations are Deteriorating; It is Still Difficult to Predict Whether a Conflict Will Occur</h3>
<p>Amid the urgent situation in the South Pacific, the Ryuta Maru, which was returning to Japan from Manila, arrived at the Huishan Wharf at 7:30 am yesterday due to fog en route. The ship carried a total of 100 passengers, 14 of whom disembarked in Shanghai. Among the passengers were Eijiro Kondo, an advisor to the East Asia Shipping Company who was going to inspect the South Seas, as well as Kiyotaro Kanegae, who had lived in Manila for 35 years. Toyoki Ishikawa, Deputy Minister of the Mitsubishi Mining and Metals Department. Shintaro Kumagai, Deputy President of the Koyo Industrial Company. And Toshisaburo Suzuki, a civil servant of the Asia Development Board. Kiyotaro Kanegae has resided in Manila for 25 years and is the Deputy Chairman of the Japanese Resident Group in the area. It is said that the Pacific issue surrounding the United States and Japan has recently become urgent. Japanese people in the area usually return to their country every year, and now most of them are preparing to evacuate. There are about 25,000 Japanese people in the area. The U.S. fleet currently in Manila is gathering many ships, starting with the flagship. The local U.S. authorities are interfering with Japanese expatriates, and Overseas Chinese are taking the opportunity to expand anti-Japanese propaganda to increase friction between the United States and Japan. Therefore, the U.S.-Japan relations there have reached the worst possible situation. Recently, the situation has become increasingly worse. It is difficult to predict whether there will be a direct conflict between the United States and Japan in the future. According to Eijiro Kondo, after the Japanese power penetrated into the South Pacific, the United Kingdom is now paying attention to Hong Kong and Singapore and is actively strengthening the defense of Hong Kong. At the same time, the U.S.-Japan relations have become increasingly tense.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Passengers on Buses and Trolley Cars Last Year Reached Over 230 Million</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report on the general situation of various public utilities mentions the general situation of buses and trolley cars, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>Bus Company</p>
<p>Fares</p>
<p>The bus fares were increased twice last year. The first increase was implemented on April 15, with a general increase of 45%. The second increase was implemented on December 17, with an increase of 25%. The reason for the fare increase was the continued devaluation of the national currency and the contraction of foreign exchange, which led to a sharp increase in operating costs. If the fares were not increased, it would be difficult for the company to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Routes</p>
<p>Route 17, which operated from Jing'an Temple to Xiaoshadu Road from June of the previous year, was intended to promote Jiaozhou Park. After it was put into operation, the fare revenue was not enough to offset the expenses, and it was finally announced to stop on October 31 of the past year. The section from the Bund to Weihaiwei Road, which originally belonged to Route 14, was changed to Route 4 from July 17. The table below shows the comparison of bus mileage and passenger numbers between last year and the previous year:</p>
<p>Mileage</p>
<p>1939: 6,656,299 miles</p>
<p>1940: 7,014,672 miles</p>
<p>Passengers</p>
<p>86,060,656 people</p>
<p>86,984,190 people</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Trolley Car Company</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Electric Trolley Car Company, in view of the contraction of foreign exchange and the depreciation of the national currency, which led to a sharp increase in expenses, immediately presented to the Bureau for approval to increase the first-class fare from an average of 3.71 cents per mile to 5.02 cents and the third-class fare from 2.54 cents to 3.43 cents from June 17. According to the company, when it requested a price increase in November of the previous year, the exchange rate was about 5.5 pence. The exchange rate continued to fall and prices continued to rise in the first half of last year, so it had to apply for a price increase to make up the shortfall. The northeast and two districts of the trolley car were still unable to operate last year. The west district was sealed off twice in October and December. During the seal-off period, the company's trolley cars could not return to the area.</p>
<p>The table below shows the comparison of trolley car mileage and passenger numbers between 1936 and last year:</p>
<p>Mileage</p>
<p>1936: 10,730,602 miles</p>
<p>1940: 10,605,470 miles</p>
<p>Passengers</p>
<p>112,085,248 people</p>
<p>149,264,657 people</p>
<p>In summary, the number of passengers on buses and trolley cars last year was 236,248,847.</p>
<h3>US Expatriates' Old Passports Required to be Submitted by Deadline</h3>
<p>The rumor that the local US consular authorities in this port took away the old passports of US expatriates and did not issue new passports has been proven to be untrue by facts, as some expatriates have received new passports. The reason why US expatriates who submitted their old passports were unable to obtain new passports immediately is that the procedures for applying for new passports are very complicated, and it takes some time to complete them. At the same time, the US consular authorities here recently stated that the current passports will not be valid after April 10, and US expatriates are required to submit their old passports before that date.</p>
<h3>Donations in Lieu of Birthday Celebrations Used for Charitable Purposes; Divided Among Various Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>Songjiang Lei Junyao, Junyan, and Juncui published a thank-you note for their mother's birthday, stating that the 22nd day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year was the ninetieth birthday of their mother, Madam Sun. Relatives and friends all believed that it was appropriate to celebrate the birthday. However, their mother has always been frugal and was particularly uneasy during the national crisis. Junyao and others, in accordance with their mother's wishes, announced to relatives and friends in the newspaper on November 17 of the national calendar that all the grand ceremonies of donating candles, noodles, and banners should be converted into cash to help charitable causes. Junyao and others also reduced the cost of banquets and alcohol and presented tea sets to celebrate the birthday. They were honored by the kindness and generosity of relatives, friends, and philanthropists. In addition to being grateful, they also donated 300 yuan to the Songjiang Orphanage, 150 yuan each to the World Red Cross, the Shanghai Disaster Relief Orphanage, and the Yesheng Readers' Loan Office. In addition to obtaining receipts, the organizations have also published announcements in the newspaper. As for the list of titles, due to the large number of people, it was not possible to publish them all in the newspaper. They are respectfully recorded and stored to commemorate the great virtue. Please forgive them. The remaining 26 yuan was paid to the Xin Puyu Hall, which was initiated and funded by the Shen Bao, and is hereby clarified for your information.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at Hongxing Printing House; Appeal to All Sectors Yesterday; Typesetting Workers in Re-edition Department Go on Strike</h3>
<p>The workers of the Hongxing Printing House at 20 Lane 406, Shanhaiguan Road, demanded improved treatment last month. After mediation, the Lead Printing Industry Association had negotiated a wage standard with the capitalists at the end of last year to maintain their livelihood. Although Hongxing was not a member of the association, it also participated. The agreement reached by both parties was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 13, but Hongxing Printing House has not complied. The workers also expressed their firm determination. A few workers were suddenly arrested a few days ago, arousing public outrage, so they went on strike. The machines and other items of the printing house were destroyed the day before yesterday, and Wu Shixin was shot on the spot by Chinese police. Workers Li Xikui and Zheng Qixiang were also arrested and interrogated by the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday, and the hearing was postponed to March 6. Currently, the Lead Printing Industry Association is appealing to all sectors to show their sympathy, and all the workers in more than 50 printing houses in Shanghai that specialize in typesetting and re-edition went on strike yesterday to show their support and demand that the authorities handle the case impartially and resolve it reasonably.</p>
<h3>Electricity Supply Currently Has No Problems</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company said that its coal reserves are only enough for three months. Vice President Ferris of the company said that if it is unable to obtain a continuous supply of coal in the short term, the company will not be able to continue to supply all electricity after three months. It is said that the company had previously ordered a large amount of coal from North China and India, but both places were unable to ship it to Shanghai due to a lack of ships. This issue is quite serious. According to Western newspapers, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors convened a meeting once on the 25th of last month. At that time, they listened to the entire report of the Power Company's representatives and decided to continue the meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the problem of reducing the electricity supply to the Public Concession, which will be caused by the Power Company's inability to obtain coal. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily, the Power Company has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve a reduction of 60% in the electricity supply. However, this statement has not been confirmed. According to Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors did not formally discuss this issue, so the statement that the meeting was held yesterday is not accurate, but there were indeed informal contacts between the directors. They are currently asking British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to arrange for ships.</p>

<h3>US Banks Will Charge Handling Fees for Foreign Currency Savings; Effective from April 1 After Notification; US Dollar Check Accounts to be Canceled Today</h3>
<p>In view of the tense situation in the Far East and in order to curb US dollar speculation, the three US banks in this city, Citibank, Chase, and American Express, have decided to cancel US dollar check accounts from today. Citibank also stopped paying interest on foreign exchange savings from the 21st of last month. According to news obtained yesterday, the three banks suddenly took another measure and will charge handling fees for US dollar or other foreign currency savings accounts from April 1. According to a Chase Bank employee, the bank's plan is to charge one yuan per hundred yuan per year. A Citibank employee said that within a thousand yuan, one yuan will be charged per month. The detailed plan has not yet been decided. An American Express employee said that there is no news of taking this measure so far, but it may be possible in the future. It is said that the above-mentioned banks will issue a formal announcement as soon as the specific plan is decided. However, this fee will not be charged to National Currency savings accounts. As for the purpose of taking this measure, the banks said that it is to compensate the banks for the expenses incurred in maintaining deposits for customers. However, people familiar with finance said that this move is to limit foreign currency savings. Since it is difficult for the banks to obtain favorable investments for the stored foreign currencies, they must try to properly preserve them. At a time when the situation is difficult to change, it is not appropriate for both bank operations and security to maintain a large amount of foreign currency, so this decision was made.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Cost of Living Index Rose Again - Food Index Slightly Lower - National Currency Purchasing Power Drops to Just Over Sixteen Cents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council published a survey of the Shanghai worker's cost of living index and retail prices for February 1941. The total cost of living index for Chinese workers in the city in February exceeded 600, reaching 602.29, compared to 597.19 last month and 377.92 in February of last year. Except for food, all other category indices increased. The food category index was 673.52, a decrease of 1.09 points from the previous month. The clothing category index was 474.62, an increase of 41.8 points. The fuel category index was 575.98, an increase of 12.95 points. The miscellaneous category index was 526.04, an increase of 28.86 points. The purchasing power of the national currency decreased from 16.75 cents last month to 16.6 cents.</p>
<p>Slight Drop in Price of No. 2 Rice</p>
<p>The decrease in the food category index was due to a slight recovery in rice prices this month. In the January report, it was mentioned that the rice market showed slight improvement at the end of the lunar year, but remained quiet afterward. By mid-February, prices rose again, exceeding the price limit. However, the average price per stone of No. 2粳 rice this month was slightly lower by 1.19% compared to the previous month, and No. 2 Saigon rice was also lower by 3.24%. The retail prices of other items mostly increased compared to the previous month. Tofu, dried tofu, fried tofu, and hundred-layer tofu are daily foods for Chinese people, and their prices increased significantly at the end of the month. Beef and fresh fish also increased significantly. In the middle of the month, the prices of general vegetables rose sharply due to rain and snow, but fortunately decreased after the weather cleared up. Salted snow cabbage, green vegetables, and radishes fell by 19.71%, 16.67%, and 24.24% respectively. Flour prices continued to rise, and salt and soy sauce also rose by 9.79% and 28.28% respectively. Although foreign exchange rates rose this month, except for a slight decrease in cotton, all other clothing items increased by 2.68% to 17.91%. Since October of last year, coal balls saw their first recovery, decreasing by 1.33%. In the miscellaneous category, yellow wine increased by 19.41% due to a shortage of raw materials and a large decrease in production. Sorghum also increased by 11.81%. Soap, grass paper, and matches, which are daily necessities, are becoming increasingly expensive.</p>

<h3>Lin Xiongji Departs Shanghai on the Tatsuta Maru for Nagasaki - Trial Not Expected to Begin Until Mid-March - Lawyer Yasui First Advocates for His Return to Japan</h3>
<p>Lin Xiongji, the former chairman of the Japanese Residents Association in Shanghai, who shot and wounded the Chairman of the Municipal Council and the Japanese Director, among others, at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers in the Public Concession five weeks ago, was escorted onto the Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru yesterday (the 28th) to depart Shanghai and return to Japan after a preliminary hearing by the Japanese Consular Court in Shanghai. He was granted permission to visit his ancestral graves in Osaka before facing a formal trial in Nagasaki. It is anticipated that the Nagasaki court will not commence the trial until mid-March, and the trial may be closed to the public.</p>
<p>Motive for Shooting is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>It is reported that the Nagasaki court must determine whether Lin Xiongji intended to kill the three Municipal Council members or merely to injure them in order to determine the appropriate punishment. According to Japanese law, if Lin Xiongji only intended to injure the three individuals, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years. However, if he intended to kill them, he will face a more severe punishment. Mr. Yasui, a Japanese lawyer in Shanghai, will serve as one of Lin Xiongji's defense attorneys during the trial in Japan. It is reported that Yasui has already returned to Japan to lobby officials in connection with this case.</p>
<p>Arson Suspects Remain in Custody</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the case of two Japanese individuals accused of arson in Shanghai, attempting to burn down the reed shed at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers within the racecourse, detailed information was not obtained from the Japanese authorities yesterday. According to reports, the two Japanese individuals hijacked a Tailai taxi two days before the Taxpayers' Meeting, drove into the racecourse, and threw flammable liquid onto the reed shed, causing a small fire. Fortunately, it was extinguished by Russian police officers from the Police Department. The two Japanese individuals also set fire to the rented taxi, but were unsuccessful and remain in custody.</p>

<h3>Adulterous Woman Sentenced to Death in Murder of Her Husband</h3>
<p>Zhang Erguniang, an adulterous woman, 22 years old, colluded with her lover, Pang Kaibao, on the night of February 21st of the 28th year of the Republic of China. While her husband, Bao Youqing, was sound asleep, she used a sharp axe to kill Bao. They moved the body to a pond 30 yards behind their residence in a grass shed on Hangzhou Road and fled together to live illicitly in Yaoshui Lane. Later, Bao's mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou (i.e., Zhang Erguniang's biological mother), discovered the crime and reported it to the police. Pang Kaibao was apprehended and transferred to the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted for murder. After a trial, Pang was sentenced to death. His appeal to the High Court was also rejected. As for Zhang Erguniang, the court issued an arrest warrant, but Zhang cohabitated with a fellow villager, surnamed Wu, renting a house in Yaoshui Lane. On January 16th of this year, she was arrested by the Gordon Road police, transferred to the First Special Court, and detained. During the remand, Zhang gave birth to a son in the detention center, which made it inconvenient to interrogate her. The case was heard by Judge Jiang the other day. The police prosecuted her for joint murder. The defendant vehemently denied murdering her husband. Although the death row inmate Pang Kaibao was brought in to confront her, Zhang continued to be evasive. However, because the evidence was conclusive, the court announced the conclusion of the trial. Yesterday morning, she was brought to the Third Criminal Court, where Zhang Erguniang was sentenced to death for joint murder and deprived of her civil rights for life.</p>
<h3>Purchased Radio - Request for Return</h3>
<p>Customer Brings Lawsuit - Yesterday's Verdict Dismissed</p>
<p>Shi Yingchi, a domestic radio expert, obtained a license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and opened the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road, producing shortwave radios that could receive broadcasts from Hong Kong and Chongqing. On July 18th of last year, a customer named Zhang Xiaotong (resident of No. 11 Chunhui Lane, Ai'erjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio from the company for 185 yuan, choosing it himself and considering it satisfactory. Two weeks later, Zhang suddenly brought the radio to the company, claiming that it could not receive Chongqing broadcasts and demanding an exchange or a refund. This led to a dispute. Zhang recently hired Chen Yanling as an agent to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment approving the return of the radio and ordering Shi Yingchi to return the payment. Based on the statement, Judge Dong Qi summoned both parties several times. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Xiangxian to attend, bringing the original radio as evidence, and firmly asserted that it could receive broadcasts from Chongqing. Judge Dong earnestly advised both parties to reconcile, but was unsuccessful. He then announced the conclusion of the debate. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Dong took the bench in the Third Civil Court and announced the verdict, the main text of which stated, "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed. The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs." At the time of the verdict, the defendant Shi Yingchi's agent, lawyer Chen Xiangxian, was present to hear the verdict. It is claimed that the plaintiff's lawsuit for return of goods had other purposes. Therefore, Shi Yingchi has filed a separate lawsuit in the Criminal Court accusing Zhang Xiaotong of harming his reputation.</p>
<h3>Sun Wenjiang's Case - Appeal Verdict of Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Sun Wenjiang, assistant manager of the former Tianquan Machinery Engineering Company at No. 41 Jiangxi Road, had disagreements with manager Geng Zhen and others. After dissolving the partnership, he established a new machinery company at No. 14 Bowuyuan Road, which was doing well. This aroused Geng Zhen's dissatisfaction, and he sued Sun in the First Special Court for embezzlement and other crimes, and Sun was sentenced to six months in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence. Sun refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Qian Zheng to file an appeal. After repeated reviews by the High Court, the High Court announced its verdict yesterday (the 28th) at 2:00 PM, the main text of which stated, "The portion of the original verdict regarding Sun Wenjiang's crime and sentence is revoked. Sun Wenjiang is not guilty. The appellant Geng Zhen's appeal is dismissed."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance - Chinese Merchants Sell Foreign Exchange - Lack of Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in the HSBC listing. The black market for British and American currencies was filled with bearish sentiment, and the signing of agreements between China and the United States was enough to sway the attitudes of operators. Speculators and Japanese banks continued to sell off American dollars, but because the transactions were not large, the price easing was limited. However, foreign banks had good appetite, causing the market to soften slightly. In the afternoon session, American spot was quoted at 5.656, and March futures were quoted at 5.59375. American dollars were quoted at 5.625 and could be settled. The forward rate was relatively stable, resulting in a firmness of .05625. The current and forward rates were both quoted at 3 pence 421875. American dollars eased .125, and spot was quoted at 5.625.</p>
<p>Positions Were Quite Full</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London cables were level for both near and far terms. New York silver prices were unchanged, and London gold was stable. Exchange rates for British pounds against American dollars and Shanghai were level. American dollars gained 25 points against British pounds, 5 cents against Shanghai, and there was no market for French francs. Central bank listed rates for all currencies remained the same. In the morning, banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 43875 for British gold and 5.59375 yuan for American dollars, which was the same for American dollars and 0.015625 higher for British pounds compared to the previous evening's close. After the opening, banks sold shillings, and Japanese banks, including Zhengjin, absorbed spot at a price of 3 pence 421875. At 9:30 AM, the HSBC listing was announced without any changes. Afterwards, due to the consensus of bearish sentiment, the Sino-US agreement attracted the attention of operators. Chinese banks sold spot American dollars from time to time, but there was a lack of buyers, and positions were full. The price eased to 5.6525. Chinese speculators also sold March American dollars, all at 5.65625. It was not until noon that the market began to soften. The closing price for spot American dollars was still quoted at 5.625, and British pounds were quoted at 3 pence 421875.</p>
<p>Both British and American Currencies Saw Increased Gains</p>
<p>Although speculators and Japanese merchant banks continued to sell in the afternoon, prices did not continue to ease because foreign banks had a relatively strong appetite. Japanese banks offered American dollars at 5.625, and speculators also sold March American dollars at 5.625. There were no changes after that. The evening closing price for spot American dollars was 5.625, and next month was quoted at 5.59375. British gold spot and futures were both quoted at 3 pence 421875, an increase of 0.015625 for British gold and a firmness of 0.03125 for American dollars compared to the previous day's close.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Hover - Spot Gold Firm and Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold black market prices hovered between 6,100 and 200 yuan. The news of the Sino-US agreement had penetrated the hearts of operators, and there was a reluctance to sell. However, general old speculators still temporarily bought, so the price was pulled up after falling, resulting in a hovering pattern. The lowest price in the afternoon session reached 6,120 yuan, due to higher foreign exchange rates and the sale of stock by Gonghe, Dafeng, and Defu. The afternoon close was only 6,145 yuan. The market continued to decline after opening in the afternoon, falling to as low as 6,105 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market rebounded slightly, and Hengji, Defu, Dafeng, and securities firms absorbed the supply, pushing the price up to 6,180 yuan. Therefore, the evening close was stable at 6,169 yuan, only one yuan lower than the previous day. Spot gold continued to rise. Zhongxing sold 50 taels each to Xianghe and Defu. Chengji sold 200 taels to Xianghe, 630 yuan higher than the forward price. Tianyuan, Lianxing, Fukang, and Yonggong sold a total of 60 taels at a price 635 yuan higher, which was re-entered by Zhongxing. In the afternoon, Hesheng sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 625 yuan higher. The remaining 6,940 taels of February's outstanding balance were mostly offset by the long and short sides according to the HSBC Bank's imported American dollar rate of 5.5625 yuan, totaling 6,260.7 yuan. Overall trading was active, with over 12,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged, and customs duties were level.</p>
<p>In the early morning, people were watching and waiting, and there was a lack of transactions when the market opened, with no excitement. The price was 2,170 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. After opening, the price retreated to 6,160 yuan due to excessive supply, but retail investors continued to buy, returning the price to 6,190 yuan. Unexpectedly, the sentiment of all parties was decadent, and the negative factors remained strong due to the rising American dollar exchange rate, causing the price to be suppressed to 6,130 yuan. Later, Xin Fengyong deliberately bought in, raising the price to 6,190 yuan. Finally, Gonghe, Dafeng, Defu, Hesheng, and others sold as the price increased, so the price hovered down to 6,120 yuan. The price then recovered to 6,175 yuan. This was because Xinyuan suddenly had a buying intention, and Deda also bought in a considerable amount. However, Hesheng and others sold vigorously before closing, and the price fell to 6,140 yuan. The thousand-piece close was only 6,145 yuan. The market continued to weaken after opening in the afternoon to 6,130 yuan, and a large supply caused the price to plummet to 6,105 yuan. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly better, and Hengji, Chengji, Dafeng, Defu, and various securities firms successively dragged in, and the trend was upward, reaching 6,180 yuan. There was little change until closing, and the result was 6,169 yuan, one yuan smaller than the previous day's small profit. The selling price of the brand gold of the cash number was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold (spot), and the purchase price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops has not changed from beginning to end, with large banks quoted at 6,690 yuan, and the price of new counterparts was similar to the above price, with the purchase price being thirty yuan lower.</p>
<h3>American Dollar Notes Backed Exchange Rate Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw fluctuating spot market prices, which eventually stabilized. However, cash was popular, so British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable, and market prices remained level. The American dollar notes backed exchange rate tended to rise because foreign banks had a very good appetite, so it rose to 8 jiao 3 fen in the morning. It finally reached 17 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen, an increase of one jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell and then recovered to level. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were in increasing demand, and market prices continued to rise. The former continued to rise to 1 yuan 7 jiao 8.5 fen, and the latter continued to rise to 1 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen.</p>
<h3>Silver Reserve Exchange Rate Interest</h3>
<p>February Monthly Interest Rate of Two Li</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House Committee has set the interbank clearing deposit interest rate for February at 2 yuan per thousand yuan (i.e., equivalent to a monthly interest rate of two li), the same as in January.</p>
<h3>Grain - Three States of the Rice Market</h3>
<p>粳 Rice Weak, Foreign Rice Tight, Glutinous Rice Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice market presented different situations, with粳 rice being weak, foreign rice tight, and glutinous rice stable. Guomi rice had been weak the previous day due to increased sources, but sporadic arrivals were still strong yesterday. Among them, thin early rice accounted for two-thirds. However, local shops still felt the price was expensive, and their intention to buy was not strong, causing the thin early rice to be weaker and unable to hold firm. Cargo owners urgently sought to sell, with an even stronger selling intention, resulting in a large reduction of one yuan. Thin early rice was quoted at 102.5 yuan, then 101.5 yuan. Due to the scarcity of thick粳 rice, the depreciation was not significant, only falling one yuan. Kunshan Yuanbai粳 rice was quoted at 107 yuan, then 105 yuan. After glutinous rice turned weak one day, the price fell. However, most cargo owners, seeing that foreign rice continued to be tight, were unwilling to sell lightly again, and the market suddenly became scarce. However, the transit route remained sluggish, and the market lacked change. Hong Kong special round grains were still 89 yuan, and long grains were 86-7 yuan. The foreign rice held by Bin Chi felt even tighter. The only spot available was Pudong Warehouse No. 1 Saigon at 85 yuan, and Returned No. 1 Siam at 85 yuan. Broken rice and green rice were 73 yuan and 72.5 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>Medium and low-quality rice was the main product, with transactions not exceeding 3,000 bags. However, after the futures price rebounded once, it turned level as the continued settlement was appropriate. The new transaction involved 1,200 tons of He Yi's March broken Saigon rice at a price of 80 yuan and 9 fen, and Shen Ji's 1,500 tons at a price of 80 yuan and 3 jiao. Jianyuan Siam yuan rice 3-month 500 tons, so broken foreign rice has become flat, while foreign yuan fell 2 yuan. The bottom inventory of foreign rice, it is said, totaled 750,740 bags as of yesterday afternoon, but this is only the publicly available stock of each warehouse. The amount stored privately by large hoarders is not easy to investigate.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Gradually Easing</h3>
<p>Flour continued to decline yesterday. After the Municipal Council distributed cheap flour for two days, the buying interest on this street sharply decreased, and floating households urgently sought to sell. It was heard that a whole batch of foreign flour would arrive at the beginning of this month, and one or two ships of foreign wheat could also arrive, so people's hearts were calm and the market was depressed. A total of more than 1,000 bags of Australian flour from Zhonglou and Huaniao brands, and 500 bags of Lanmai Hua brand were traded, with prices all at 25 yuan and 6 jiao, lower than the previous ones. With goods on the way, they must be sold after arrival, and the market is tired and lacking vitality.</p>
<p>The arrival and sale of wheat remain silent. On the Chinese factory side, they are waiting for the supply of foreign wheat to continue production. Japanese factories are more greedy, but ultimately there is no considerable spot available for collection. It is heard that recent negotiations to sell goods have not been successful, so the market is as silent as ever.</p>
<h3>Securities - Government Bonds Mostly Bought</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for public bonds saw strong buying interest from Xinfu and Xinhua Lianhe and Defu on the 16th, especially in the afternoon. However, as it was nearing the close of the afternoon session, Xieda urgently sought to sell because it was too late, temporarily suppressing the market price, and the vigorous atmosphere was slightly reduced, but the trend was still very stable. There were fewer transactions in the morning session, with Xinfu, Shunchang, Zhihe, and Jiufeng buying, and Delong, Tongkang, XieDa, and Hengfu selling. The afternoon close was slightly firmer by one or two jiao. In the afternoon session, Xinfu had an even stronger appetite, followed by Xinhua, Defu, Yichang, and Lian. Type C opened at 66 yuan, and Runde also had a buying appetite, and the market price gradually increased. Although Delong, Tongkang, Yitai, Tongshun, Lianhe, and others sold, the market price was still fixed at 6.3 yuan. As the close approached, Xieda suddenly had a temporary transaction to sell 100,000 yuan, and Hengfu, Xiexing, Yuanxie, and Kang took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply and broke the 6 yuan price. At present, people's hearts are still inconsistent. Those who are optimistic believe that American and British aid to China is becoming stronger and more effective, and that the economic cooperation between China and the United States is no problem due to the satisfactory return of the Cooley envoy. Those who are pessimistic believe that the Sino-Japanese problem is tense, and the interest payment date is still far away. However, the multiple views are relatively sufficient. Moreover, most of the bulls are now in the financial sector and overseas Chinese, so the future is still optimistic. The market price resulted in a small increase of five fen, one jiao to two jiao. Type B was unchanged, and Type D and 96 have not yet been traded. The transaction volume was approximately 2.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified Type A 73.80 73.40 73.55 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Type B 69.00 68.60 66.70 Flat</p>
<p>Unified Type C 66.35 65.60 65.60 Down 0.15</p>
<p>Unified Type E 64.20 63.80 63.80 Down 0.20</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Chinese Electrical Stock were traded, with a price of 7 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Thursday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various British companies in the Far East remained flat and sluggish, with no increase or decrease in the prices.</p>
<h3>Silk Floss and the Silk Market's Apprehension</h3>
<p>Current Cotton Sales Suddenly Cease</p>
<p>The silk market has turned sluggish, and a downward trend has begun again. This is because after the market price increased, the actual demand remains weak, and some profit-takers are selling off. As for certain parties close to the silk factories, they massively bought in on the previous day, and today they are again dumping large quantities. This indicates the uncertainty of people's minds, leading to inconsistent market fluctuations. Considering the current situation, judging by the reduction in electricity, there should naturally be an upward trend. However, there has been little actual progress. Miscellaneous brands of silk are inexpensive, and even Double Horse silk is affected. The high price for 20-count Double Horse silk was 1,391 yuan, and the low price was 1,357 yuan. In the early afternoon, trading started at 1,360 to 1,358 yuan, rising to 1,386 yuan, with a low of 1,380 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse (Morning): Continuing the sluggishness from the previous afternoon, the opening price was 1,170 yuan. However, most traders rushed to buy long positions, pushing the price up to 1,391 yuan in a short while. Then, news of stable foreign exchange and falling gold prices caused a continuous decline to 1,357 yuan. The market closed higher at 1,364 yuan. The total daytime trading volume was 7,735 bales. A breakdown of the amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 175 Ningbo: 10</p>
<p>Traders: 7,450 Total: 7,735</p>
<p>Today (the 1st), 2,020 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The current situation for raw cotton remains as quiet as ever. The factory demand is weak, and the trend is flat. 184 pieces of cotton were shipped to Yantai on the 1st.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is quite firm. However, due to selling by Southern brokers and profit-taking by a few long positions, the market price suddenly fell. As a result, the closing price was 4-5 points lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton did not fluctuate significantly. Yesterday, including predictions, it fell by one rupee.</p>
<p>Trading of imported cotton in Shanghai is stagnant, with little activity. Although the current silk situation is favorable for purchasing raw cotton, everyone is indifferent and unresponsive.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Cakes Completely Controlled by Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil cake market rose overall, driven by bullish sentiment and a hopeful outlook. Futures trading was only active in soybean oil, but existing cakes were absorbed by hoarders, causing the price to rise by two jiao. Although soybean oil supplies were sufficient, they were controlled by speculation, making it difficult for the market to become smaller. Yesterday, the market showed an upward trend of more than one yuan. A total of 100 barrels of spot Dalian soybean oil were traded at 119.25 yuan. 400 barrels for March delivery were ordered at 120 to 118.5 yuan, then rose to 119.5 yuan. 300 barrels for late March delivery were ordered at 119 to 119.5 yuan. 150 barrels for early April delivery were ordered at 147 to 146.5 yuan. 50 barrels of Jiangbei local mill oil were ordered at 140 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Sheng Ji brand soybean cake were offered at 74.85 to 75 yuan. 3 carts of Yuan Long brand cake were offered at 75 to 75.1 yuan. Fei Zi brand cake was offered at 74.85 to 75.1 yuan. 4-5 carts were traded. 1,160 tins of raw oil imported on the 28th arrived from Qingdao. 335 bags of soybeans and 9,330 pieces of soybean cake were all shipped to Hong Kong on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk "Control" Takes Another Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets fluctuated. The price of silk in Shanghai remained unchanged. Although foreign firms were interested in buying, trading volume was low due to a lack of inventory. Currently, most transactions, such as those for Golden Arrow, Golden Leaf, and Robison brands, are for products from the one or two remaining silk factories in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also, starting today, the export licenses for raw silk used by the Shanghai Bureau of Industry and Commerce Inspection, which were previously on yellow paper, will be changed to green paper. Furthermore, all raw silk will be subject to quality inspection. This is another step towards a controlled policy. Today, 268 pieces of tea were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sales are Slow in Both North and South</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend turned weak. Hoarded goods were released, and selling prices generally declined. Fine cloth opened at 43 yuan in the morning, down 2.5 jiao per piece from the previous day. It continued to fall by 5 jiao in the afternoon. Transactions of Ewo coarse cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Fine twill cloth from various factories fell by 5 to 7.5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 jiao. The street traded over 500 pieces of various cloths. Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Ningbo merchants traded over 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Guangdong and Chenghai merchants traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth and twill. Business was extremely slow for both Nanyang and Northern merchants. 2,334 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on March 1st.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices first fell and then rose, but the market remained stable. White cotton Dragon Head fine cloth traded as high as 47.5 yuan, and as low as 46.85 yuan. The final price was 47.35 yuan. Colored Four Gentlemen serge fluctuated around 1.278 yuan. The closing price was 1.2775 yuan per chi.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Production Areas Report Price Increases</h3>
<p>The origin of foreign sugar has risen. According to data, it is 10.0825 yuan in the Netherlands. A telegram from Hong Kong states 22.75 yuan. According to the guild's assessment, Taikoo Cube White rose 5 jiao to 79 yuan. B mark is 79 yuan, HX mark is 76.5 yuan. Spot Two Four Coarse White from foreign warehouses is 79 yuan. Futures rose 5 jiao. Shipments by the 10th of next month are 79.2 to 79.5 jiao. Shipments by the 20th are 79.6 to 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Cigarettes Are Being Bought Up Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for cigarettes was tight, due to strong buying from hoarders, leading to another price increase. British American Tobacco cigarettes opened at 1,302 yuan, Old Knife cigarettes at 964 yuan, Five Flowers cigarettes at 686 yuan, Little Fairy cigarettes at 677 yuan, Middle box of Golden Mouse cigarettes at 465 yuan, Middle box of Beauty cigarettes at 710 yuan. There are not enough Fu Xin Pyramid cigarettes allocated by the factory to meet market demand, so prices are tight, trading at 700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Western Dried Goods Inventory Dwindling</h3>
<p>Western dried mussels are not being replenished, leading to a dwindling market inventory and continuous price increases. Yesterday, dried mussels were offered at 160 yuan, large dried mussels at 140 yuan, medium dried mussels at 225 yuan, and small dried mussels at 110 yuan. The market outlook is stable.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Supply of Zhaoyun is Scarce</h3>
<p>The supply of Zhaoyun from Shantou is scarce, and the factory no longer has any stock. However, traders still have goods on hand, so the trend is very popular. It was found that the first market price was 108 yuan, and the current market price continues to rise.</p>
<h3>Standard of Living and Cost of Living</h3>
<p>— Mune</p>
<p>What is the "Standard of Living"? What is the "Cost of Living"? The standard of living is "the totality of the quality and quantity of necessities, comforts, and conveniences habitually used by an economic entity in a certain time and space." Simply put, the standard of living is "the level of daily use of goods and services by a person or group." For example, if A, B, and C each drink one pint of milk, half a pint of milk, and half a pint of soy milk every day, respectively, then because milk is of higher quality than soy milk, and one pint is more than half a pint, their standards of living are ranked in descending order as A, B, and C. As for the cost of living, it can be said to be a concretization or monetary cost of the standard of living. Its determination is based on the monetary value of daily consumables. In other words, the cost of living is "the sum of the monetary value of the necessities, comforts, and conveniences habitually used by an economic entity in a certain time and space." Using the previous example, assuming the price of milk is one yuan per pint and the price of soy milk is five jiao per pint, then the daily living expenses of A, B, and C are one yuan, five jiao, and two jiao and five fen, respectively. Therefore, A has the highest cost of living, followed by B, and then C.</p>
<p>Under the same time and space, because the price of goods increases or decreases in direct proportion to the quality of goods, the amount of living expenses can also be consistent with the level of the standard of living. The only difference between them is that the standard of living is an abstract noun based on utility, while the cost of living is a concrete noun based on monetary value. However, prices vary with time and place, so the standard of living and cost of living also differ in different times and spaces. To give a simple example:</p>
<p>Year Total Purchase Price of Annual Rice Consumption</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 25 3 shi of national rice 30 yuan</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 29 2.5 shi of foreign rice 200 yuan</p>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the salaryman A's rice consumption changed from national rice to temporary rice, and from two rice meals and one congee meal a day to two congee meals and one rice meal. Therefore, whether in terms of the quality or quantity of rice consumed, the situation in the Republic of China year 29 was much lower than in the Republic of China year 25. In other words, A's standard of living has declined significantly compared to before. However, A's annual rice expenditure has soared from 30 yuan to 200 yuan. In other words, A's cost of living has increased by nearly six times compared to before. From the above example, we can clearly see that the cost of living not only does not necessarily keep pace with the standard of living in different times, but sometimes even goes in the opposite direction. As for different spaces, because the prices of goods of the same quality and quantity are not necessarily the same, the cost of living and the standard of living cannot be proportionally adjusted, which is even more obvious. There is no need to elaborate here.</p>
<p>In short, because prices and currency values are not fixed, an increase in the cost of living in different times and spaces does not necessarily indicate a higher standard of living. Under the current circumstances, although the cost of living for the general population has increased sharply compared to before the war, prices have risen even more, so the standard of living of the masses has not only not increased, but is in a dire state. Therefore, shouting about a high standard of living today is a misuse of the term, because in fact the lives of the general population after the war are much more difficult than before the war!</p>

Last night, they faced the French Business Association. This was no less than a final, because if the French Business Association won, the Shuttlecock team's championship seat would be shaken. Otherwise, the Shuttlecock team would retain the championship. In yesterday's match, Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji, who were reunited, displayed great prowess, easily defeating the French Business Association's Brendz Flot with scores of 15-4, 15-1, and 15-4.

<h3>China Statistics Society Holds 10th Annual Meeting: Remarkable Achievements in the Past Ten Years</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The 10th Annual Meeting of the China Statistics Society was held at 9:00 AM on February 15 at Qiujing Middle School. Attendees included Zhu Jiahua, President of the Academia Sinica, Chen Qicai, Comptroller-General of the National Government, and more than 100 members including He Lian, Zhu Junyi, Zhang Xiaomei, Wang Zhongwu, Guan Yifei, Huang Zhong, Fang Xianting, Li Deyin, and Huang Houduan. Zheng Yaozi, Chairman of the Annual Meeting Preparatory Committee, presided over the meeting and reported on the preparations for the annual meeting. Then, Vice President Zhu Junyi reported on the achievements of the society in the past ten years, which mainly included more than 100 papers from the ten annual meetings, and the published Journal of Statistics and Statistical Series. The theme of this year's discussion was statistics and price control and statistics and food management. Next, President Zhu gave a speech, raising two points of thought: (1) In the past ten years, China's statistical undertakings have become increasingly developed and institutions have expanded. However, due to the poor national foundation and the low level of the people, it is quite difficult to manage. In the future, our statistical work should not be too high, and we should start with the basic conditions first. (2) The topic of this annual meeting is the most important issue at present. I hope that everyone will focus on the institutions, improve efficiency, and study the methods that are most suitable for the times. Next, Comptroller-General Chen gave a speech, pointing out that it is not easy to promote statistical administration in our country because administrative officials at all levels have not fully recognized the importance of statistics, so that China still does not have accurate statistics on population and land. This is not the fault of academic researchers. In the future, I hope that leaders at all levels, both centrally and locally, will attach importance to statistics and raise public awareness. At the same time, cultivate statistical talents. I admire the gentlemen of your society for engaging in statistical academic research. The National Comptroller Conference will open on February 20, and I hope that you will be able to contribute your research findings to the conference for reference. Finally, Chairman Zheng gave a reply. The thematic discussion and official reading of papers began at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, presided over by Wang Zhongwu, Chairman of the Paper Committee. The papers included Fang Xianting's "Agricultural Information Reporting and Food Management," Zhang Xiaomei's "General Review of Price Control in Our Country," Luo Ru's "Economic Construction and Price Hikes," Chen Zhengmo's "Statistics and Price Control," Chu Yifei's "Wartime Price Issues," Zou Yiren's "Application of Once Delayed Analysis to the Study of Price Changes," Yu Shourong's "Preliminary Proposal for Compiling a Wartime National Wholesale Price Index," Zheng Yaozi's "The Three-Link System of Statistics and Administration," Li Fan's "Promoting Statistical Undertakings and Statistical Legislation in Our Country," and Wang Zhongwu's "Review and Countermeasures of Wartime Price Issues in Our Country." After the papers were read, the members raised opinions and discussed them in detail. The meeting did not end until 6:00 PM. The discussion continued from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 16th, and a social affairs meeting was held in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Profession: Meeting an Old Friend in a Strange Land</h3>
<p>— Luoying</p>
<p>One sunny Sunday afternoon, I was walking alone on the street, trying to dispel the worries in my chest. The breeze blowing on my body did bring a hint of spring. I felt excited and had an inexplicable feeling on my face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a young man I seemed to recognize came towards me. When my eyes flashed across his face, he suddenly showed a look of fear, trying to avoid me. But I wasn't afraid to be presumptuous, so I walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and said very politely,</p>
<p>"Brother Huimin! It's been a long time!"</p>
<p>"Ah...ah...Brother ××! How are you?" He said, nodding his head, but seemed very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Since we were meeting an old friend in a strange land, I had to ask where he was now.</p>
<p>"Sigh!" He sighed softly: "To tell you the truth, brother, I am now unemployed, and I have been unemployed for more than a year. Although I have asked people everywhere to help me, it is still like a stone sinking into the sea. I really..." His head was down, and he seemed to have unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>He was my elementary school classmate, and it had been many years since we last saw each other. He had a long, thin face and loved to talk. After we parted ways, I heard that he had gone to Shanghai to learn business, and that he had entered a silk shop. We had never corresponded once since then, and I had almost forgotten him. Today's chance encounter was something I never dreamed of.</p>
<p>We turned a corner, and a warm wind blew in. I asked him about his address with concern.</p>
<p>"I'm temporarily staying at a distant relative's house, but they are also very poor. I'm too embarrassed to just sit and eat at their house, so..." He paused and finally plucked up the courage to continue: "I have now become an apprentice to a master, and I will have to brazenly bum a meal from him tonight. I..."</p>
<p>"A master? Who?" Before he finished speaking, I quickly asked him. But he laughed. Finally, he said to me seriously: "I'll tell you, it's the fortuneteller on ×× Road."</p>
<p>"Oh!" I began to be surprised, but my sympathy finally outweighed my suspicion. "Huichi! You seem to be..."</p>
<p>"I don't want to fall, but I really have no choice. I will definitely find another way in the future. Now I have to grit my teeth and work hard." He defended himself anxiously as he spoke.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a while. He asked me for a mailing address and said: "Come over and talk to me when you have time."</p>
<p>At the crossroads, we parted ways. I said to him with concern: "I wish you all the best and hope you can find a more suitable position soon." His tears were about to fall, and he choked out three words: "Thank you!"</p>
<p>I watched him walk away with heavy steps. The warm wind lifted the corners of his clothes.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>The Advantages of Being Left-Handed</h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>I recall reading several articles about left-handed people in magazines before, from which I gained much practical knowledge. For example, if I have a son in the future and discover that he prefers using his left hand to eat sweets or play with toys after the age of two or three, I will never force him to learn to use his right hand like most people, which could dull his vision or hearing, or even cause him to stutter.</p>
<p>Recently, while flipping through old magazines at home, I came across another short article about left-handed people that was quite interesting. I and a left-handed person conducted an experiment at the Zhejiang University sports field, using a football to kick at a pole, and we found that the statements made in the article were indeed true. Now, I will translate it as follows:</p>
<p>"If you are left-handed, you have no reason to say that this is a disadvantage. On the contrary, you actually have an advantage over most right-handed people. According to recent scientific research, left-handed people are the only ones who can walk in a straight line. It has now been discovered that no right-handed person can walk five hundred yards straight towards a prominent target without needing any markings. Right-handed people tend to veer to the left severely, and their path forms an arc with the apex on the left side.</p>
<p>If there are no stars or other landmarks, and you tell a right-handed person to 'walk straight ahead' in the desert, after a full twenty-four hours, they will definitely return to their starting point. This is why people who get lost in the desert often suddenly find themselves back in places they had already been to several days before. Science has not yet been able to explain this fact, which may be due to a characteristic of our nervous system that has not yet been considered. Only one type of person can walk straight, and that is a left-handed person.</p>
<p>An infantry commander said that when marching in unfamiliar places at night, if there were left-handed people, he would always have them walk on the left side of the column, so that he could be confident that the direction was straight and unbiased.</p>
<p>Now that England and Italy are fighting fiercely in East Africa, I remember that among the British soldiers stationed in Shanghai before, there was one nicknamed 'Yellow Hair' who was very good at playing football, especially good at kicking with his left foot. I wonder if his hand is also more skillful with the left than the right? If so, if he goes to the African desert, he should always walk on the left side of the column!"</p>
<h3>Occupational Diseases</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hui</p>
<p>Dr. Sha Xia Si, a medical doctor at the University of Oregon in the United States, published an interesting report. According to his investigation of two hundred male patients suffering from a rare form of breast cancer (in 1938, a total of 14,315 women in the United States died from breast cancer, compared to only 145 men), he found that many of them were carpenters and shoemakers. This is because they often hold tools or other workpieces tightly against their chests while working. In addition, postal workers are also prone to this disease because their chests are often compressed by the bags they carry.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) An Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang kept wringing her hands, her mind in such a turmoil that she couldn't think straight.</p>
<p>"I also heard from the people in the accounting room that Shen Mazi has connections with the police局. Even if his injury can be healed, Zhao Lao Er will have to face several years of legal trouble..." Zhao Si said with his copper-bell eyes wide open.</p>
<p>When people are in distress, the first savior they can think of is always the person they respect or trust the most. Therefore, Qiu Haitang immediately thought of Yuan Shaowen.</p>
<p>"I wonder if Seventh Master has returned yet?"</p>
<p>Zhao Si didn't answer immediately. He looked up with his fat face and pondered for three or four minutes. Suddenly, he slapped his hand on his right thigh, and a hint of a smile appeared on his weary face.</p>
<p>"Seventh Master may not have returned to Beijing yet, but Third Master might be on his way!"</p>
<p>"What? Third Master?" Qiu Haitang asked blankly.</p>
<p>"That's right, Yuan the Garrison Commander!" Zhao Si said, as if very proud. "You probably don't know about this yet! Let me tell you! Third Master also has a residence in Tianjin."</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang would not be surprised even if Zhao Si said that Yuan the Garrison Commander, such a extravagant and lecherous warlord, had residences in every major city in China.</p>
<p>"But if he is really on his way, why haven't we seen him once in the past ten days or so?" This was what Qiu Haitang couldn't understand.</p>
<p>But Zhao Si couldn't answer either, only replying vaguely:</p>
<p>"That's why I said he might be!"</p>
<p>"Then what's the use?"</p>
<p>"But we might as well work separately," Zhao Si said, looking very capable. "You go ahead and send a telegram to find Seventh Master, and I'll go back and inquire about Second Master's residence. If we get lucky and happen to find him, wouldn't we have a savior?"</p>
<p>Hearing him say this, Qiu Haitang felt slightly relieved.</p>
<p>"Looks like we won't be able to sleep tonight!" Zhao Si stood up, looked at the sunlight just peeking through the window, and yawned. (43)</p>

<p>The Arts World</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"Tin Pan Alley"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>The so-called "Tin Pan Alley" is the birthplace of American musicians in New York, although many of them died old and unrecognized. This film tells the story of the romance between two sheet music publishers, Han Pan En and Jake O'Kay, and a pair of singers, Alice Faye and Betty Grable. Although the story itself is nothing more than a romance between men and women, this romance is quite touching, and young audiences cannot help but be moved by it. Alice Faye, angry that Han valued songs more than his love for her, leaves for London. Han loses Alice Faye, and no one asks about his songs. Destitute, he enlists as a soldier with Jack when World War I breaks out. Later, they arrive in London and meet Alice Faye, but she already has a fiancé. Han has no choice but to leave dejectedly. However, Alice Faye cannot let go of her old feelings and tries her best to rush to the pier to see him off. The two are reluctant to part, and Alice Faye finally says to him: "I'll wait for you," until John returns triumphantly, and Alice Faye welcomes him by singing his song. This "Tin Pan Alley" ends in a melodious sound.</p>
<p>This story is naturally more moving than the similar "The Dolly Sisters." The inserts in "The Dolly Sisters" can also be found here. For example, the "Arabian Nights" performed by Alice Faye and Betty Grable in a London theater is as gorgeous and luxurious as possible. The tap-dancing duo in "The Dolly Sisters" also shows off their skills here, dancing with novelty and vigor. Naturally, these are exciting and stimulating, especially when Alice Faye and Betty Grable appear half-naked, singing and dancing, they are even more beautiful.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, the most wonderful part of the whole film is the farewell scene at the pier. Alice Faye and Han meet again after a long separation, and the two cannot help but embrace each other warmly. Then, they look into each other's eyes, and the thoughts in their hearts are conveyed through their eyes. Alice Faye and Han's inner performances are both profound, and their expressions of wanting to speak but hesitating, and being reluctant to part, are really too touching.</p>
<p>Although Betty Grable does not have many scenes, she gives the audience a deep impression. When she appears on stage with Alice Faye, she is more moving than Alice Faye in the dance. John Payne's acting is very steady; Jack Oakie is very brilliant and is the best supporting actor in the whole film. Although the director does not have any particularly outstanding points, the tone of the whole film is light, brisk, and concise, without a moment of slackness or dullness.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Beauty Famine</h3>
<p>— Tu Tu</p>
<p>Many authoritative producers in Hollywood Studios feel that the lack of pure and beautiful actresses has become a very troubling problem. Although various film companies have searched for many beautiful and moving women, making Hollywood a concentration of beauties, it is still difficult to find those who emphasize pure beauty, causing great panic.</p>
<p>When MGM's beauty recruiters were looking for forty-four pure and beautiful women to fill the "Ziegfeld Girl" standard, they also felt that pure beauty was hard to find. More than five hundred enthusiastic female applicants requested a review, but only forty-five were selected. However, these selected ones were only preliminarily qualified to be filmed, and most of them will have to be eliminated in the final selection. From this, it can be seen the strictness and prudence of the Hollywood producers in selecting materials.</p>
<p>The female standards jointly set by producer Pandro Berman and famous director Robert Leonard are: a height of five feet and seven inches, and those who are too tall or too short are excluded. Just the height alone has such harsh regulations, and other conditions are even stricter. Crowds of young women want to enter the embrace of Hollywood, but are rejected outside the silver door. Hollywood has its own compelling reasons.</p>
<h3>"China" News</h3>
<p>"The Light of East Asia" is scheduled to be released recently at the "Cathay" in the provisional capital, Chongqing. The film has been screened at the "Central Grand Theater" in Chengdu for five days starting from January 26, with four shows a day, attracting more than 10,000 viewers.</p>
<p>Since the completion of "The Baptism of Fire" and "Victory March," "Border Storm" and "Japanese Spies" are now being rushed to film interior scenes day and night in the first studio of "China." "Youth China" and other military education films are being worked on in the second studio.</p>
<p>The "China" China Long Live Troupe is scheduled to stage "Mind Defense" recently, and will perform "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers" as a charity performance to raise funds for the Women's Work Team of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs.</p>
<p>Director Sun Yu is currently rushing to complete the editing and connecting work of "The Baptism of Fire." It is said that he will go to Chengdu at the end of February to shoot the exterior scenes of "Ten Thousand Miles of the Sky."</p>
<p>The "China" newsreel "Anti-Japanese War Special Issue No. 6" was shown in Chicago, San Francisco, and other places in the United States, causing a sensation. Recently, "China" has received many letters from American audiences, praising the film and hoping that "China" will often transport new films to the United States for screening.</p>
<p>The "China" cartoon "Wang Laowu Goes to War" has already been completed, and a new cartoon, "Little Hunter," is currently being produced. The content depicts a child disguising himself as a hunter to conduct reconnaissance and guerrilla work, and is both serious and humorous in nature, with profound significance.</p>
<h3>A Life Philosophy of Struggle (16)</h3>
<p>I have made the determination to struggle against the current adversity. Therefore, I have controlled all my energy and fought against adversity with a fierce and indomitable spirit. I am fearless, unafraid of sacrifice, have a clear goal, and use consistent effort.</p>
<h3>Bloody Rain in the Jade Garden</h3>
<p>— Yumin Mingdao</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>When talking about the historical traces of governance, chaos, rise, and fall, there are often one or two women embellishing them, such as Xi Shi by the Gusu Terrace and Yang Guifei in the Huaqing Palace. Therefore, the general Confucian scholars' rigid theories often severely criticize beauties as the source of disaster, as if female beauty is enough to destroy a country; even regarding beautiful women with red makeup and green eyebrows as floods and scorpions. Isn't this a great misfortune for the women's world? In fact, in the past era of male dominance, the key to the survival, peace, and danger of the country was in the hands of men. With the emperor's supreme status and under the autocratic and licentious power, what could he not obtain? However, he happened to encounter a romantic prince who loved beauty more than the country, indulged in sensual pleasures, forgot his position, and neglected the affairs of the court, which allowed foreign enemies and internal troubles to rise. Except for Xi Shi, who was presented by the King of Yue, it should be discussed separately. Others, whose own fate was also held in the hands of others, how could they know anything about the rise and fall of the country? Moreover, there are women who are deeply concerned and care about national affairs, but unfortunately, their words carry little weight and are of no help to the times. For example, the poem by Lady Huarui of the Shu Kingdom, "The king raises the flag of surrender on the city wall, how can a concubine in the deep palace know? One hundred and forty thousand people lay down their armor, not a single one is a man." How poignant are these words! Alas! It is unfortunate for beauties to be born in troubled times and encounter extraordinary events. What is performed is often something they cannot know or want, but people lightly shift the blame for the destruction of the country onto women. Frankly speaking, who can be without feelings when faced with the faces of hibiscus-like beauties and the dances of willow-like slender beauties? Kings love beauty, scholars love beauty, and those who hold imperial pens and command troops also love beauty. But if one can be like Mencius said, "If the king loves beauty, share it with the people, what is there to object to?" And in the two hundred poems of the Book of Songs, Guan Ju sings of the graceful lady, who can be sought day and night. This is not the author defending women. On the contrary, there are many examples in history that can be pointed to, such as Nie Yinniang and Hong Qian, Liang Yu and Yun Ying. The city of women is impregnable, and the women's army is invincible. Moreover, there are some unnamed heroines. When the Central Plains were in turmoil and foreign enemies invaded, many scholars often cowered under the blade, losing their masculine spirit, losing their integrity in the face of difficulty, and shamelessly serving the enemy. How can fathers blame their daughters? And the tragedy of leading wolves into the house was staged because of the military commanders' foolishness and selfishness. How could this disaster be what the lady herself wished for? Moreover, the lotus seed is bitter, with hidden intentions. The infatuation and fervor in their hearts are no less than those of the heroes who sacrificed their lives for righteousness. By Shanhaiguan, only stains remain; by Kunming Lake, there are still traces of beauty. However, within these stains of humiliation and traces of beauty, there are many chaste and ardent jewels, struggling and running in the light of swords and the rain of blood, trying to bloom brilliantly with the flowers of revival. If things do not succeed, it is fate. Heroes cannot be judged by success or failure, how can the writer remain silent? To render and connect them, to write them out one by one, for modern people to read quickly, I am afraid it is not only for entertainment during wine parties and tea breaks.</p>
