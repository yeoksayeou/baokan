<p>路透社二十八日東京電　據巴達維亞消息、荷蘭政府已停止去歲荷印與日本所締結之油類協定、此間觀察家對於此項步驟、是否僅為暫時應付因凍結日本資產所引起之不穩定　率、抑或荷印計劃完全停止油類協定、以加强對日之敵意、表示懷疑、但皆信荷印係與英　採取並行之行動、</p>
<p>合眾社二十九日東京電　「朝日新聞」今日痛斥荷蘭東印度凍結日本資金之舉動、「朝日新聞」稱、此種舉動係對日本所建築合作建立「大東亞繁榮國」之毫無掩飾之拒絕、並謂荷蘭參加對日本之包圍、該報稱、「日本現應出以一切行動、應付荷蘭此舉所引起之問題、同時應毀滅荷蘭當局蒙英國之獅皮、飾美國之鷹毛、以輕視日本之惡夢云、」</p>
<p>合眾社二十九日東京電　荷蘭及荷印僑民在日之資產、已於今日開始凍結、目前日方之凍結行動、包括美·菲·北愛·加拿大·香港及荷印在日之僑民、</p>
<p>合眾社二十九日倫敦電　此間昨日所得跡象為民主國對日之商業金融限制、或將從寬實施、有根據之觀察家謂、美國及荷印仍將　續發給日方運輸之執照、據估羅斯福總統之意、此次英美荷三國之舉動主旨、原在警告日本、並不願操之過急、迫日本開戰、又倫敦之日方負責方面稱、現下東京之措施、足以對英美荷報復為限、日將從寬施行之、日本不擬作侵略泰國荷印或美屬土地之南非舉動、大約亦不致有侵犯上海公共租界之行動云、</p>
<p>合眾社　九日東京電　大藏省官員本日宣稱、凍結法令之緩弛、須視環境然後定、此即表示日本暫時不形成一定之政策以待美國政策之闡明、觀察家相信日本將依照美國之態度、即彼寬我亦寬、彼嚴我亦嚴、</p>

<p>路透社二十九日東京電　荷屬東印度既追隨英美辦法、凍結日文資金、故日本刻在經濟上完全處於孤立地位、其所可往來者、僅為亞陸上為日方支配之區域耳、眾料此種事態目前將悄然忍受之、但一俟不利影響既已顯着時、爆裂即將發作矣、朝日新聞稱荷印因美國行動而起之困難、已凍結日方資金、雖在表面上以為一種　衛上事件、但實質上顯有與英美一致行動之意云、在日資金不日將被凍結、至於英國與加拿大在日之資產、則業已凍結矣、</p>

<p>合眾社廿九日華盛頓電　昨日華盛頓郵報之社評稱、麥克沃塞中將之被任為遠東軍懷念、係對日本之警告、又稱羅斯福總統此舉、係在緊急狀態中之更進一步之警告、若此尚嫌不足、則美國將在遠東之利益、巴爾的摩日報之社評、謂此次對菲列濱陸軍之任命、足以影響日本或能使東京清醒、因在此時遠汞、極需要有清醒之狀態及決心也、</p>
<p>路透社廿九日華盛頓電　美參院昨日一致通過、麥克沃塞將軍以中將衛、指揮菲島美軍之任命、</p>

<p>路透社二十九日倫敦電　「每日電聞」今日社論、日軍開入越南之運動、其領袖明知終必引起後果、但以魯莽滅裂之故、不能容納忠言、然國中頭腦清醒者對於前途實深憂懼、自荷屬東印度加入英美計劃後、包圍日軍之圈實際已告完成、日本今後所需之原料、幾　完全仰紛呈滿洲中國越南矣、而此三地者向啞缺乏若干種之戰爭必需品、尤以汽油為最、繼論及日本所取報復舉動、謂日本殊難覓得辦免窒息之任何途徑、即訴諸武力、然茍非其海軍能控制南海、並能佔據東印度與泰國、無濟於事、至於今次之新封鎖、是否將驅　與民治國用武、則將拭目以覘之也、「新聞紐帶報」載文謂、日本於承平時代意圖積聚戰品、恐未必待此戰品消耗殆盡、而後從事獲取遠汞之霸權、故或不久將有舉動、或永遠無有舉動、設決定以其前途作太平洋博孤注之一擲、即將見民治國皆有備以待云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>經濟封鎖與戰爭</h3>
<p>二十世紀的寰球各國，沒有一個國家可以脫離國際資源溝通而存在的。一九三五年義大利侵略阿比西尼亞的時候，英國代表艾登，曾在國聯發動對義經濟制裁而未成，但在當時，義國當局，已經現出了非常慌張的狀態。西班牙內戰中，一九三九年佛蘭哥之所以獲勝，是由於叛軍完全佔領了各處海港，再加上英·法對政府軍海外接濟的完全封鎖。至於上决歐戰，德國最終的崩潰，完全由於協的軍的嚴密封鎖，那更是世人所公認的。拿日本來說，在那樣資源貧乏和狹窄的地域上，居然可以建立起一個相當强大的軍事機構，牠的物資，當然大部份來自海外：對外軍事掠奪與經濟競爭同時進行着。中。日戰一直打到了四年多的今天，牠所以尙能支持下去，還是賴了由貿易所換來的物質補充，這其中最重要的，是來自美·英及荷印。如果牠們及早斷絕對日本的原料接濟，那末，日本僅有的積儲和資源可以維持多久，是很成問題的。</p>
<p>西方的德·義·由於估計錯誤而攻蘇，現在將陷入絕境，替自己完成了一個嚴緊的封鎖圈，牠們失敗命運現已注定，不過是遲早問題而已。而牠們的東方盟國，現在又蹈了覆轍，蔑視英·美的一再警告，悍然佔領越南，一舉而引起了英·美二荷印·等一致的經濟制裁。本來，以美·英·荷印集團經濟力量的雄厚。對於像日本那樣完全倚賴對貿易而存在的國家，這决一致裁制打擊之重，是不難想像的。祗要一看這兩天來，日本海外航業的完全停滯，牠本國及其控制區域中人心的浮動。以及市塲物價的完全混亂等現象，立刻就可以知道。將來局面延長下去，縱使撇開軍事不談，即在經濟上，牠勢必也終有全體潰敗的一天。</p>
<p>可是，鑑於這次經濟制裁對日本見效的迅速與深刻令人不得不發生的感想，似乎有兩點：第一，這個制裁可惜沒有提早實行，吾則，世界侵略勢力能吾像現在這樣猖獗，是很成問題的。第二，這决經濟制裁，已經正式宣佈的，僅僅以資金凍結及限制貿易爲限，而沒有徹底實行全面的經濟絕交與封鎖，這是美中的不足。從制裁的時間說，中，日戰一開始時，美國就有人主張對日經濟制裁，迫牠放棄侵略的程序；而四年以來，也不斷地有人向日本提出警告，促牠尊重美國在太平洋上的利益，吾則，美國並無需訴之於軍事行動，即有法置牠於困境。然則，爲什麽這個最有效的武器，直到今天局面這樣緊急的時候，方拿了出來，而不及早運用呢？美國對於這一點貽誤的責任，是無法吾認的。現在經濟制裁，終於實現了，美國已下了最大的決心，此後進一步的舉措，隨時可以實施，以軍事上無往不利，不可一世的德國軍事機構，一朝陷入緊密封鎖時，尙且呈現了江河日下的必敗形勢，何况其他實力更小的侵略國家，在這裏，蘇聯目前對德的堅決行動，更可以作爲美國的借鏡。太平洋上，有資格仿傚蘇聯在歐洲所採打擊侵略者那樣堅强途徑的，無疑的，現在唯有美國而已。</p>
<p>當然，因爲英，美，荷印對侵略勢力所採取的堅强行動、現在的太平洋上，又湧現了一朶戰雲。不過，這朶浮雲到底會不會帶來風雹，或者僅僅隨風吹散，現在從事論斷似乎還嫌太早。僅僅從形勢推測、美國牽入戰爭最可能的形勢，是在束西侵略勢力實際聯繫携手的時候。具體點說、假如德國攻下蘇彝士向印度推進，同時日本開始南進攻擊新加坡等地，或者德國攻下莫斯科及列髯格拉等地，日本向西伯利亞進攻的時候，這兩種情勢一出現，那時無論如何，美國勢不得不挺身一戰。然而當前的實際情形，不獨東西兩組侵略勢力一時難以實際聯成一片，而且，西方的侵略者，已經遭到了空前頓挫，困進了軍事與經濟兩重堅强壁壘的核心，絕對沒有方法衝出重圍的。所以這時美國不問在東方採取什麼堅强舉動，以牠國力之强大，如果說東方侵略勢力竟會與牠兵戎相見，那眞是太出於常理之外了！所以，一面澈底對東西侵略者經濟封鎖，一面再竭力更大規模援助中，英，蘇，同時再動員海，陸，空軍作不惜一戰的準備，這些是保持美國不牽入戰爭漩渦，及提早結束世界戰禍最可靠的途徑。</p>

<h3>實施凍結資金　美銀行奉到訓令　維持常態繼續購入外幣　規定貿易申請外匯辦法</h3>
<p>自英美先後頒佈凍結中日資金後、上海各友邦銀行初則對此保守緘默、於實施方法、因未奉各該政府命令未允宣佈、惟美商銀行已於昨晨奉到實施訓令第五十八及第五十九兩號、所規定之凍結辦法、較一般人前此所預料者更為嚴密、至於中美貿易之特別照會、并非謂——四家特許銀行可隨意供給貿易匯兌、僅供給平常美國進出口之匯兌、本埠美商銀行之政策、端在繼續向任何國籍之賣方重行購入外幣、以免所處之情形、較之上星期六晨凍結令頒佈時有根本重大之變化、銀行界方面相信、匯市情形、仍屬「多買、」因一般進口商亟望能獲得美國之貨物也、</p>
<p>限制辦法</p>
<p>美商接到一般照會第五十八號及第五十九號、係分別根據凍結美匯中國資金及在美國之中國資金兩者而發、在此訓令下、中國資金將遭凍結或封鎖、至關於凍結美匯中國資金之一般照會第五十八號規定「甲」美國及中國任何部份（滿洲除外）之貿易、須合於以下條件、</p>
<p>（一）此種貿易、不得由下者經營、或由下者委托代管、亦不得與下者有關、（一）中國以外之封鎖國家、或（二）住在滿洲之人民、或（三）中國以外之封鎖國家人民、住在中國者不在內、</p>
<p>（二）此種貿易不得雜有封鎖國家（中國除外）今天滿洲之人民或中國以外之封鎖國家人民（住在中國者除外）之利益財產、（自訓令有效之日起或隨時、）</p>
<p>（三）申請外匯之貿易、須符合下列二條件、（一）此種貿易、必須為善意之進出口、合法正常、而其進口或出口品之價値、必須相當於所申請之外匯總數、（二）此種進出口、須符合本照會之所有條款、</p>
<p>「乙」在美國而經本照會核准授予權力之銀行、必須立即備存美國聯邦準備銀行之月報、該月報載有在此時期中貿易規定之細則、包括有關此種貿易規定之細則、包括有關此種貿易之借貸賬目之證明方法等、</p>
<p>（丙）本照會中所稱「住在中國」之人民、係指自一九四一年六月十四日起、在中國而在中國國內經商者而言、</p>
<p>（一）受有特種照會經營此種貿易之銀行、為大通·花旗·友邦·美國運通·莫斯科國民·通濟隆·匯豐·有利·老沙遜·新沙遜·麥加利·荷蘭·安達·及Davidsassoon　＆　Co.等十四家、（二）經本照會特准之銀行、對中國任何部份（滿洲除外）與以下國家之貿易、准給外匯、（一）美國、（二）美洲共和國、（按照會第九十三號規定者）（三）大英帝國、（四）蘇聯、（五）荷印、</p>
<p>外商銀行　維持滬匯</p>
<p>中國外匯平準基金委員會、對維持上海匯率及供給各業正當需要之外匯、並不採取公開方式辦理、係授意各友邦銀行暗中維持、使匯率站在自然水準綫、各業如確因正當需要外匯、得向經營外匯各銀行購買、惟各銀行對購買者必須經過審核認可、以免為投機者所朦蔽、及落在日本商人之手、同時調整現貨及近遠期匯率防止外匯套利、關於申請法定外匯、則限於各自由區域、蓋上海因環境特殊、一切貿易、中國政府無法統制、為增强功效起見、故採取上述辦法、</p>
<p>申請法定　外匯辦法</p>
<p>關於自由區域之申　法定外匯、規定凡進口商經營之進口物品、不在禁止輸入之列、而為中國國內所必需者、得申請購買之、應說明用途·貨名·數量·價値·起運口岸及日期·進口地點·運銷地點·申請幣別及金額·凡經外匯審核委員會核准者、指定中國或交通兩銀行按照法價售給、但申請人須繳納法價與中交兩行掛牌價格之差額平衡費、申請人應於外匯購竣時、將特准購匯通知書、送外匯審核委員會註銷、惟奢侈品及半奢侈品等一律不准申請法價外匯、</p>
<p>華商銀行　靜待部令</p>
<p>經營外匯之華商銀行、（中中交三行除外）為上海·浙江興業·浙江實業·金城·大陸·東亞·中孚·中南·華僑·國貨·國華·中興·廣東·墾業·企業·等、關於此後之外匯業務、業已向財政部請示、一俟奉到部令、即遵照辦理、在未奉命令以前對各外匯戶、則採取臨時辦法應付之、預料日內即可奉到正式命令、並聞關於各業及個人遭凍結之外匯、倘確係正當需要、如採辦國外必需品、及外國留學費用等、得呈請中國政府或駐英美大使館說明、請求轉向英美政府予以通融、</p>
<p>金融市塲　漸趨穩定</p>
<p>上海各市塲、昨日　已不若前日、在驚浪駭濤下、而已轉趨穩定、英商匯豐銀行黑山外匯掛牌與前日相同不動、而實際交易因、　（一）匯現貨及七八月期貨收盤三辦士一五六二五、（二）美匯現貨及七八月期貨收盤五元二一八七五、英美外匯計均放長〇六二五、金市已回落、上午收盤六千六百四十五元、下午收盤六千六百七十三元、至於各商品市塲各種商品價格業已回落、惟外國股票及紗花價格之劇變、原因為國際局勢日緊、及江海關禁止出口諸問題、</p>
<h3>海關禁運範圍擴大　竟增至十一種　三英輪已裝貨物均卸下　中外商人遭受重大負擔</h3>
<p>本埠江海關當局、在日籍副稅務司赤谷山助統馭之下、前日起為策應日本政府報復英美凍結日本及中國淪陷區之資金活動、特由總務科日藉稅務小山田通吿禁止多種商品出口運往外洋（日本除外）或中國自由區域、因此本埠英美及其他友邦之進出口貿易、突呈紊亂不安之象、而華商營業、亦將遭遇空前之危機、昨日為禁運後之第一日、貿易市塲、混雜無章、本埠中外人士認為長此以往、必將發生重大之國際糾紛、對於前途、咸寄以密切之注視、</p>
<p>禁運物品　達十一種</p>
<p>海關禁運出口之物品、前傳僅有八種、唯昨據記者探悉、其範圍業已擴大、已達十一種之多、除昨日報載之機器·糧食·五榖·飼料·油類·化學物品·肥料·紗布·礦物·五金等、另增之三種為棉花·藥材·及顏料等、上述十一項物品、於前日午後起即行開始禁運、各報關行以通吿所載之物品、前往請求報運出口者、竟被拒絕結關、并將小山田所發之英文通吿、遍貼於各報關臺、行商目擊此景、祗得含氣吞聲、怏然而返、因之出口停滯、大感不便</p>
<p>英輪三艘　被迫卸貨</p>
<p>自江海關禁運通吿發出、被禁貨物、不准運往香港仰光後、外商輪船、蒙受絕大打擊、昨日下午出口之湖南·瓊州·兩輪、事前祗裝運香港雜貨少許、不料即遭留難乃將該項雜貨完全起出、湖南輪空船赴港、瓊州輪則經汕頭·香港·赴暹羅、對運往暹邏之油類·疋頭棉紗·五金等類、照常裝運出口、又怡和洋行裕生輪、定今晨由本市直放香港、事前報裝之港貨、昨日一律退關起出、故定今晨亦空船駛港、</p>
<p>禁運品名　尚未露佈</p>
<p>查江海關禁止出口之貨物共有機器·食物·油類·化學品·榖類·飼料·肥料·棉花·金屬·礦砂·染料與藥物·昨（一十九日）晨江海關內有大批商人候取日方禁止上海出口之貨名表、</p>
<p>各種商業　均受負担</p>
<p>出口禁令立即發生之影響、尚未可知、但商界相信此項新限制、將使上海各種商業均受重大負担、據稱、年來上海情況雖極攘不寗、但因出口增加、獲得大量外匯、故本市商業、仍頗繁盛、今受此禁令阻礙、自將大感困難云、一般預料非至對禁令之實施所知較詳、則不致感受禁令之真正影響、</p>
<p>機器金屬　早受限制</p>
<p>日當局自實施禁止金屬等類貨物出口後、聞今後出口申請書、將由江海關日員審查、關於機器與金屬之限制、未使商界人士震驚、因江海關前雖未正式禁止機器與金屬出口、然若干運輸商欲運出此兩種貨物、而向江海關申請必要之許可證、頗感困難者、已有多時也、</p>
<p>美商方面　絕無影響</p>
<p>據此間負責美僑聲稱、上海美商號從事上述貨物之輸出業、絕無僅有、故此間美商業不致受日方禁令之影響、而美商界亦不以此為慮、蓋過去四載來、日方已對在華外國貿易、連美商業在內、備施歧視也、日方最近此舉、對於美商業絕少影響、</p>

<p>解答疑問</p>
<p>昨有金禮楫君致函本報、大意可分兩點（一）助學金章程所訂主要科目得八十分而平均須七十分、此點實欠事實性、因各校學生如喜理科者、則文科必較遜、反之而喜文科者理科必較遜、入若須各科均好、實非易事、（二）上海各校之分數標準、各有高低、實不能以八十分為標準、均望能以考試方法確定其成績云云、金君之意見、固亦有相當理由、然本報自始即愼重考慮、深覺確定資格、頗咸種種困難、最後决定以主要科目須八十分而總平均須　十分為合格、蓋小學科目、有六七種、而中學科目近十種、故只注重少數主要科目、因此種主要科目為升學造就之基本學問、必須是八十分、方能望其深造也、至專科學校以上之學生、則以主系主要科目之成績為準、此點請金君特別注意、幸勿誤會、蓋攻理科者、祗須理科之主要科目滿八十分即合格、其他科目成績雖差、並無妨礙、其他各科、依此類推、關於第二點各校規定分類雖無定準、但究屬少數、當然酌量辦理、如用考試取决、確是最佳方法、或於將來採用之也、</p>

<h3>上海社會人心　永久在浮動中　卡拉黛維夫人之談片</h3>
<p>印度國民大會　員卡拉黛維夫人（Mrs.　Kamaladevi見圖）上週由美抵滬不日即將前往陪都，記者日昨特携帶照相機，往訪於其寓所，承夫人吿以此交儼滬後對上海所和之印象，經記者歸納為數點於後：</p>
<p>（一）上海社會人心，均似無永久穩定之計劃，時在浮動中。（二）資本主義國家在上海採行之政策，乃以壓榨剝削，只謀本身利益為唯一目的，一旦名利兼收，即滿載歸國，而視上海如敝履，絕未為上海前途建設着想。（三）上海薪給階級及勞働界，均呻吟於資本家壓力之下，正如印度社會之情形相似。上海租界行政當局對於謀社處，惟只偏於勞資調解及兒童保障之一部份工作。</p>
<p>夫人此次曾週遊歐美各國，對於歐戰亦有深刻之觀察，認為民治國前途，正有無限光明，並對載後印度之展望，亦頗樂觀。</p>
<p>夫人在離滬前，已允本埠國際人士所組織之中西聯誼社邀請公　演講　次，其命題為「印度之新趨勢」（New　Trends　in　lndia）（祖　）</p>

<h3>讀書的記憶法（一）</h3>
<p>— 胡德齡</p>
<p>我們如果只有知覺、而不能記憶、便不能形成有意識的生活、因爲這樣、我們便不能不累積由知覺得來的舊經騐去促進新經騐的產生和形成、而且知覺所引起的覜念、一部分總是從過去經騐得來的、有了那種覜念知覺、才有意義、學習和記憶、分明是一種事物的兩方面、學習是愛更和促進、記憶是保存、因爲有保存、才有變更和促進、讀書呢、誰也知道記憶的必要、</p>
<p>一、記憶的階段</p>
<p>現就記憶和讀書的關係討論如下、記憶的段落、可分（一）印象、（二）握住、（三）憶起、（四）再認四點、</p>
<p>（一）印象　凡受外來的事物、形成一種感應結、此種感應結、就叫做印象、這種印象在吸收的時候、必須有良好的性質、方才有助記憶以善良的影響、讀書時、最宜注意集中、否則讀過以後、腦中將得不到印象、</p>
<p>（二）握住　印象旣已吸收、就應該保存不忘、這樣、便是所謂握住、如果印象來到而不將它握住、印象隨來隨失、就不能絲毫保存了、</p>
<p>（三）憶起　凡是經過印象而被保存的事物或村料、有時因爲當前的需要而重新的憶及、這樣、就是所謂憶起、</p>
<p>（四）再認　當一種巳經由印象而保存的事物或材料、有時重被喚起、就有一種情感發生、這種情感的發生、即是再認的情感、</p>
<p>二、記憶的條件</p>
<p>記憶、是基於神經系統的習慣、神經系統對於某種事物的感應成爲習慣、才可以記憶、記憶根據生理的關係、須有次列的四個條件、</p>
<p>（一）記憶和新舊的觀念成比例新得的觀念、再生很易、再生的印象、也很明瞭、舊得的觀念呢、要看時日的長短而定的、所得的觀念距離愈日久、再生就愈難、距離愈日近、再生就愈易、</p>
<p>（二）記憶和學習的决數成比例凡學習的决數越多、記憶越容易、吾則、記憶就較難、</p>
<p>（三）記憶和注意的强弱成比例學習注意力强的、記憶也强、吾則注意力薄弱、記憶也就薄弱了、</p>
<p>（四）記憶和資質的智愚成比例大概資質聰明的、記憶力强、資質愚魯的、往往記憶很差、</p>

<h3>金融　英美不欲操之過急　黑匯市塲出入自由</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌各滙均平、英美滙暗市轉趨回鬆、乃華銀行及美行吐售、華商投機家出籠過於補空也、自晨開即鬆、英行滙豐少供、後雖復進、而投機家巳轉扒來塞、進口商結款雖巨、有華行及大通售出、美金由五元一五六二五硬至五元二五可結、俄即回至照上價可售、下午投機家少扒、後有四行將撤退傳說、勢在進口洋行扒結中轉軟、終兩匯均軋鬆、成交頗巨、投機家新買賣絕少，揆之情理、外匯凍結以後、交易宜有相當限制、而返觀市塲情况、則適得其反、個中情况、豈誠如二十九日倫敦電訊所云、昨日此間所得跡象、爲民主國對日之商業金融限制、或將從寬實施、此次英美荷三國之舉動、主旨原在虛聲恫嚇日本、惟恐操之過急、逼使日本開戰、英美在遠東財產首遭其殃、故仍不放棄其綏靖政策、致目前外滙市塲、有此凍而不結之奇形怪狀也、致具體辦法、更無頒布之日</p>

<p>進口商不斷結進</p>
<p>午投機交易轉稀、少扒八月五元二五、聞進口商仍不斷結進、日有利多傳說、金價復昂、故於晚收時、情勢頗緊、三點半收市、現貨至八月期英金三辦士一四〇六二五、美金五元一八七五、比前日收市、英長〇四六八七五、美長〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯現貨鬆</p>
<p>香港二十九日（週二）電、今晨滙豐開盤吿平、美滙現貨鬆一二五、爲二十四元七五、申滙現貨升二元半、爲四百七十七元半、餘無變動、</p>

<h3>金市風浪漸逝　現貨已退入八千元內</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤晤盤、變動似巳轉小、然市勢仍在動盪不定中、蓋於謠風籠罩下、各方人心由疲轉穩堅、價遂步跌後而稍回漲、一度潰退、曾入六千六百元內、蓋傳香港封鎖、美日緊張關係有增無巳、美滙之步鬆達五元二五、故經金號證劵兩幫傾售、遂由六千七百三十元步退至六千五百九十元低價、本市又有某項利多傳說、午收前回升五六十元、下午開後平疲、不久聞美國有日商輪放出關係、或可轉弛、更謠今日銀行停做外滙、激起金證兩幫復進、曾抬近六千七百元、爲某錢莊售出壓低、終見軋小二十七元、全日交易五萬兩、掉期（七月轉入八月）賣方貼出予買方的七十元、現金巳反動回退至八千元內、上午順源出二十兩價八千元、天元出五十兩、爲八千零五十元、萬豐出五十兩、七千九百八十元、德孚出二十兩、七千九百五十元、均銀樓業買進、下午時和進永豐餘一百兩、價七千九百六十元、又進萬豐二十兩、七千九百五十元、益大出某銀樓二十兩、七千九百元、軋小三百元、首飾金亦步降四十元、計八百十元、</p>
<p>期貨回小念七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九　十五分開市、爲六千六百六十元、比上日收價低四十元、成記·同康·永·大豐·義元來買進、一躍七十元、抬至六千七百三十元、俄聞美金五元一八七五可結、益大·順源·祥興·永力售、步小至六千六百八十元、明豐·新豐與銀號幫補進、在六千七百元左右盤旋甚久、直至十點半後、外滙續鬆、人心更虛、益大傾出、合盛·誠達·期豐·鼎盛紛起售出、價遂步降一百二十元、遜至六千五百九十元、益大復進、新豐永亦買、在利多傳說中、回升至六千六百五十元、正午收市六千六百四十五元、下午二點開市六千六百四十元、計低五元、合盛·順源·一利售出、立見步降三十元、盤小至六千六百十元、不久在利多謠風中、益大·天元·同康永·合盛等叫起收吸、散戶復起拖進、價步升八十五元、達六千六百九十五元、爲大豐·一利吐售、當見回遜至六千六百六十元、聯興·同康永又進好十數元、三點半收市、六千六百七十三元、比前日收價回小二十七元、照八月美金五元一八七五結價、爲六千七百十三元、計撳叫十元、收後六千六百六十五元、當日有一百四十元高低、現金號本牌金、門市售價仍八千元、收進低一百元、現標余無價無市、</p>

<h3>日票忽然下跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤現貨猛降、期貨亦稍趨疲、故英美金鎊隨跌三元、英金票亦降五角、美金票開盤一千九百二十元、　後志誠盈泰等購　、略高至二十五元、嗣忽大　、興盈　順泰永等售出、　爲一千八百九十七元、順泰永又購、抬至九百十三元、午收十元、午後開盤零八元、開後協泰永售出、　爲九百元、價泰永轉購、正大亦進、抬至二十五元、晚收一千九百十　元、比上日軋　九元、現貨十八元九角、　港票趨勢　挺、市價頗俏、日金票忽　　跌、　市退爲二元零四分、　　　　　勢　　、晚市　爲元　角二　、</p>
<h3>紗花　南路若不通　雙馬紗頓陷困境　兩日間跌去二百元</h3>
<p>紗市續瀉、且跌風仍熾、此因海關日稅務司禁止紗布棉花等出口條例公佈後、市塲大爲震盪、人心惶恐、因爲雙馬紗僅靠內地一路航綫、一般投機商、將其作標準看待、內中稍有做作、平時之價格、較別紗獨高、予天女紗價易貴二百元外、一旦變化爆發、反動愈速、下降劇烈、所以此路不通、一瀉千里矣、至於一般手中執現貨之戶、鑒於本紗被禁、不能出口、在期貨市塲及現貨雙馬廠單一律套出、以資保護、暫避風險、紗市大受打擊矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千五百四十五元、低價爲一千四百五十五元、午後人心恐虛、達於極點、初做一千四百三十五元至四十元、漸後直瀉至一千叫百零五元、三點以後精有利多謠風、同時盈利人抵補、回至一千四百八十元收盤、不過目前紗市、因兩日來慘落二百六十元外、當然有一度回風可能性也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、形勢頗虛、塲中一致在喊賣出、然叫低要進、首盤價爲一千五百二十五元、少頃跌至十元、買者紛紛、一刻而回升至一千五百四十五元、但客幫生意完全停頓、在此三四十元之間、不料十一時半以後、因有一批現貨商大量的套出、於是市價不支而慘落、一刻而即鬆至一千四百五十五元、繼後盈利人略補、回至一千四百六十元收盤、查半日間之成交統計九千零二十包、計同行辦進九千包、香港幫去二十包、</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、因環境利空、流言甚熾、八月期多頭轉賣甚暢、暴跌六十元、價做一千四百零五元、拍至九月空戶抵補、略漲十五元、價做一千五百四十元、十月尙跌五元、價做一千五百十元、開後新買與補空梢增、八月高至一千四百三十八元、九月平定、十月一千五百二十三元、入後現紗下降、港銷停頓、賣風重熾、八月下跌至一千三百　十六元、九月一千四百四十五元、十月一千四百三十六元、各月期俱跌達停板程度、多方務須繳解追證及證金、三盤八九兩月停拍、十月期回上十九元收盤、午收八九兩月各跌七十九元、十月跌六十元、後市開二兩盤、因人心續呈鬆勢、市價未曾拍出、至三盤時盛傳四行有撤退說買氣重振、市價步開步高、八月比午收回好二十二元、九月三十六元、十月三十元、晚收結果、八月期比上日仍跌五十七元、九月跌四十三元、十月跌三十元、各月期以九月份高低相差九十五　爲最鉅、全日共成交四萬三千五百五十包，比上日增加六千六百四十包、再將全日開收盤高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<p>期紗市塲、今日交割停市。</p>
<h3>紗市突變　棉商氣短</h3>
<p>現棉情况、昔日一致看漲、因洋棉步升、隨之向上、豈料　來紗市突變、跌風旣慘、且銷路被禁，廠方勢必有停工之虞、所以對於原料擯棄而乏人問詢矣、市價因之猛跌、昨市成交僅號家一筆交易、巴西花一百件、棧交價五百零三元、比上日跌二元光景、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉洋行定價家易、自從美國宣佈凍結中日資金及將實施禁運以後、太平洋頓呈不安之態、此後美棉之來滬與否、及在日本將實行報復凍結之情形下、上海能吾可以照常貿易、皆爲當前亟須解決之大問題、同時更因海關正式佈吿不准紗布二項出口以後、現紗市塲遂即急轉直瀉、陷入一蹶不振之地步、因之棉商進意蘭珊、市况感疲、前昨二日匪特直接定購者、不敢嘗試、即現貨之羅致、亦無人過問也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市不定、而有參差、先因南方幫及紐奧倫斯買進而漲、續後又因國際局勢、不容樂觀、及多頭獲利了結而跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲跌二三磅音不等、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布湧出　東疋漲落倐忽</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市反動回跌、乃因紗布等禁運、引起恐慌、浮多出籠、售價又步步盤小、惟午後有起利多傳說、布價返漲、結果白貨仍降每疋二角半至五角、漂染布交易寥寥、本街成交各布三百餘件、北路姻津幫辦綫呢嗶嘰絨布等二百餘件、華南生意、暫陷停頓中、又今日有棉布三十六件、運往新加坡、</p>
<p>東布　取引所期布先跌後回、結果較前日收盤、降落每疋三角至八角、而現貨市塲、亦被投機囤戶所橾縱、倐升倏降、變化莫測、白貨細布細斜大致俱無榮辱、龍頭細布廠單晚收仍爲五十元零九角、色貨四君子嗶嘰最高盤時、到一元六角四分二五、最低盤見一元五角七分、收盤成交爲一元六角三分半、則跌每碼六二五、</p>
<h3>糧食　存米固多　投機不止價不定</h3>
<p>昨日洋米早市跌風甚勁、尤以現洋米小絞爲最、蓋市上存底本來充塞、而來源迄未見阻、滙水一長、更可續定、且聞工部局又有五千噸新交易成議、加之不利買方之謠言甚盛、因此零整各多均有吐出叉聞米價如再操縱不止、大有封禁棧房之說、獲利者更圖急脫、故現小絞開價即小一元、爲一百二十四元、　仍一百二十三元小至一百二十元、比前日有五六元之差、但未幾又有利於買方之說、市叉逐步回高至一百二十三元半、蓋市價一小、投機幫莫不趁小吸收、加之謠諑紛紜、一時利多、一時利空、民食之米糧早已籠罩於投機氣氛中、市價宜其忽大忽小、而彼投機之皮球幫、操縱之大戶、誠有只怕市面太平靜、時局太安定、不能盡如其願望、今在國祭事件一日數變之時、宜其認爲惟一良機、正好儘興活動、其實滬上存米連同途貨總計已達三百萬石、杜梗雖少、總可幫助、在民食上則一年半載中殊無足顧慮也、但收市終見回起二三四元、結果現米仍扯小元外、而期路與現　英華司則升降互見、計一號現貨陣包開至一百五十元、碎米一百〇七元半至一百〇八元半、二號暹米現一百四十五元、期一百四十二元、小絞期一百　十九元、現百四十九元起一百五十元一百五十一二元至一百五十三元、現貨當初　時若一號西貢曾有一百卅六七元及小絞一百二十七元之呼聲、旋以上述原因、重復回小、浮圃散戶食心不死、又起扒、收市一號西貢爲百卅一二元、二號百二十三四元、敏黨普通貨百二十八元、百二十六元、宿次百念二元、茄佛米百念九元、百二十七元、小絞百二十三四元、東京砶次百十一元、碎尖九十六元至九十四元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米及國洋兩　、市貨均寥落、但以價格轟足、且又洋米回平、人心轉懈、銷塲不爽、開價與前相仿、計售南港新鮮早晚稻　爲百五十四元至百五十一元、無錫原已白粳百四十二元至百三十八元、而香港白元爲百二十六元至百二十三元、糯茶百十六元至百十三元、金卅國糯百二十七八元、</p>
<h3>麵粉緊張　空氣消散</h3>
<p>昨現洋粉市况、重入疲境、蓋以金融劇變，激起漲風後、忽有禁止轉口消息、其緊張空氣、頓時消殺、在實銷减退、囤戶出籠之下、市面急轉下游、統市做開金龍粉三十三元至三十二元九角、收市僅三十二元七角半、砲臺粉三十三元九角至八角、收市二十三元七角、花烏牌澳粉太古棧三十三元八角、及雙鷹五燕等粉併計成交一萬四五千包、比上日已回小七八角、</p>

<h3>專收介紹費</h3>
<p>— 曹鳴</p>
<p>借問房子何處有　念秧遙指××村</p>
<p>正想回來吃飯的時候，突然在電桿木上發現一張紙頭，（愛文義路，麥特赫斯脫路口）那見是這樣的寫着：『房屋——介招處，——××村××號劉姓。』</p>
<p>『這個機會不可錯過呢！』我想着，便向××村走去。</p>
<p>那兒已有二位女太太模樣的人在請求介紹，待她倆去後，那個人來跟我接洽：『大約你要靠近那一段？』『靜安寺附近』我答。『緞帶你多介紹幾處好麽？』他不待我回答就拔出自來水鋼筆，撕張拍紙簿塗了一陣交給我，接着又是一句：『每介紹一處介紹費一元二角。』</p>
<p>結果他給我介紹四處，我以四元代價酬予。</p>
<p>可是，又失望了，第　家住家不租，第二家只借寫字間。</p>
<p>待我將到第三處的時候，手裏的錶已指着『２』字，肚子巳經吃不消，心裏打量着：『第三處是靜安寺××館樓上，還不如先吃了一客飯再上樓去看房子。』</p>
<p>當我吃飯的時候，走進一個中年婦人，踏進門就問：『可是此地有房子租？』立刻帳台傳出一聲：『派啥用塲？』『住家，』『住家不租。』</p>
<p>『住家不租？』不約而同的，在那中年婦人頭上，我的頭上，好像倒了一盆冷水似的。</p>
<p>等了一息又來　位西裝靑年：『請問一聲借房子跟那兒接洽？』『派啥用塲』『做寫字間。』『不借，只租住家。』</p>
<p>這樣一來，倒使我奇怪起來了，究竟是怎樣的一回事？</p>
<p>吃好飯，就向侍者問：『此地樓上有房子出租？』侍者還沒有回答，帳台上倒先傳出：『派啥用塲。』從起初二位借房子時的談吐中使我得到一個經騐，於是反問着：『你預備借給人家做什麽用？』他用尖銳的眼光向我巡視了一番，文質彬彬，而且還挾着一隻公文皮包。（裏面藏報紙和茶房給我的召租條子）狡猾地說：『只租住家，別的不借』那末請你陪我上去看看。』我說。</p>
<p>他似乎有點失望，因爲他意想中我是去借寫字間的。但又沒法，因此收下了介紹書陪我到樓上去。</p>
<p>房間小得不可再小，朝路旁開一扇窗，因爲樓下是酒館店的廚房，所以房間裏滿佈着烟，連屋頂也燻得黑漆漆，他角落裏放着四五隻舖蓋，據說是老司務睏的。他告訴我每月租金二百五十元。</p>
<p>雖然我已知道他門的把戲，但我想錢已到他們手裏，還說點什麽呢？所以只得從　路——直豎樓梯，板壁夾層跑出</p>
<p>唉！他們的進益倒不錯呢！假使一間房子一天有三十人去上當，那末一月的介紹費巳有一千元，况且，晚上仍可睏人，上海眞是無奇不有。</p>

<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「梅寳，你要吃這一碗飯指望是有一些了！」他把手裏的胡琴故了下去，竭力忍住了心頭的歡喜，裝得十分鄭重地說：「不過咱們唱戲的人要想賺大錢，一小半固然靠天分，但一大半還得靠用心學習。你要是眞想跟我學習的話，至少必須磨練兩年，那時候才可以一萬八千的向人家開口了。」</p>
<p>兩年，梅寳雖然覺得太久了，可是「一萬八千」這四個字，却已像一針麻醉劑似的打進了她的血管裏去，使她不自覺地把頭連連點了幾下。</p>
<p>她想這幾年來爸爸眞是够苦了，吃不飽，穿不暖，有那一天看見他笑過？這一次病了幾個月，請大夫的錢，配藥的錢，以及雇兩個活計幫着小狗子下田去的錢，那一文不是從她臥榻底下的那口舊皮箱裏拿出來的。梅寳每次抽出一張鈔票來的時候，便很淸楚地看見她父親臉上的筋在牽動，不用問，就可以知道他。裏怎樣的難受！後來在他病勢沉重，昏迷不醒的幾天裏，還一再模模糊糊的念着：「一千完了」，「五百完了」，「還有三百不到了」……這一串可痛的囈語。</p>
<p>「就是兩年以後戲學會了，一時賺不到一萬八千，每月只能騾個一千八百，也可以比此刻舒服上幾百倍啦！」她垂下了頭，一面拈弄着自己的衣角，一面這樣想。</p>
<p>「可是有一點，我得先吿訴你：」尙老二不停的搓揑着十個給鴉片烟薰得焦黃的手指說，臉上還是透着很溫六的笑容。「學戲的規矩却跟你們學堂裏有些不同，學的時候，我是一個錢也不要你的，可是在你把戲學會，出去上臺之後，我這個老頭子的下半世，就得完全靠你啦！孩子，想一想看，你樂意不樂意？」　（一七一）</p>

<h3>一年來學校生活的回顧</h3>
<p>— 葉惺年</p>
<p>在這特殊環境的上海，濫竽充數孳孳爲利的學店，充塞在孤島上，掛着神聖的幌子，實際上都在經營交易；而學生呢，有許多也毫不顧惜他們難得的求學機會和寳貴的靑春，更不思念到國家社會所寄予他們殷切的期望。</p>
<p>一年前，我盲目地進入了這樣的一個學校，開始見到了裏邊的黑暗，在色色俱全的敎室裹，充滿着荒蕩無恥，嘻笑怒罵的聲音，沒有一刻寗靜，即使敎師在大聲嘶喊地講解，他們却有充耳不聞的定力，因此師生間感情，也漸漸的如冰與炭，無法溶合，最難堪的就是每日如此搬演着。</p>
<p>學生眞太放縱，太自由，上課時的任意掉座，無時或止的高談闊論，隨時哼哼的京調艷曲。於是激成敎師以責打怒駡爲訓導唯一良法，在昔扑作敎刑，固然是敎師的專利品，但是在現在這種訓導的方法，轉到了極端的情緒下，只是拳腿飛舞，滿室叫囂而已。</p>
<p>這種責打怒駡，是吾合乎敎育的原理，固不必論，結果原是我行我素，改進旣未見絲毫，師生的對立，却留了更深的裂痕。</p>
<p>學校本是敎育的樂園，「循循善誘」也是敎育的成法，「非心服也」亦是先哲的警語，師生自有師生間的感情，何致都挾着一般勞資的面孔以兵戎相見，眞是世風日下，慨嘆無已。</p>
<p>我們應知道建國的基礎在學校，這種志在金錢徒重形式，而不能使敎育合乎時代化的，決不能存在現在的大時代，對於這些沒有自學，自治精神的靑年們，更需要合理的督促和指導，在赤誠相見下去尋求密切的聯繫，打成一片，那末堅固的團結中，何懼不能產生出不可摧折的偉大力量來！（移酬助難）</p>

<h3>故都梨園近事記（中）</h3>
<p>— 悔廬</p>
<p>寶森慧珠合演探母</p>
<p>楊寳森本爲二牌鬚生，曾隨章遏雲，宋德珠等數度南來，甚受顧曲者歡迎，認爲目今鬚生中難得之人才，北返後，經友人慫恿，自行組班，的徐繡霎等合作。最近寳森公演「四郎探母」於三慶戲院，合作者爲言菊朋之掌珠言慧珠，二人掛並牌，戲報上廣告，非常離奇，楊氏名下，貼「探母回令」，言氏名下則貼，「鐵鏡公主」這大概是楊言合作的一個特別條件。最近聽說寳森將以頭牌的姿態，與滬人相見於黃金，果成事實，也許會轟動一時的。</p>
<p>少山菊朋合作進宮</p>
<p>「二進宮」一劇，爲生旦凈之合作累工戲，全劇自始至終，唱個不停，要是生旦凈三人中有一軟弱，即將大大遜色，因此以前這齣大好骨子戲，被列入冷門戲之中。前歲譚富英張君秋王泉奎等在黃金排演是劇，居然一唱而紅，「二進宮」乃一變冷門戲爲叫座戲，像言菊朋，鄭冰如輩，來滬出演，也均以此戲號召。但歷决演出終因搭配欠健，未能盡善盡美，允以徐延昭一角最感才難。最近聞將有一特殊演出，名單是金少山之徐延昭，言菊朋之楊波，南鐵生之李艷妃。少山之「二進宮」灌有唱片，黃鍾大呂，確是演徐延昭之最理想人物。言菊朋本以唱工勝塲，其「二進宮」中，有「春夏秋冬」等特有唱句，除嗓子稍窄偶有怪腔外，也可說是演楊波的典型人物。至於南鐵生，前曾在黃金作短期公演，唱腔動聽，爲識者贊許，今三人合作，成績之美妙，自在意料之中，可惜這一台好戲，不能搬到上海來演，吾則準令轟動一時。主角此番公演，另有一反串小戲。「雙搖會」，名單是很發噱的：——金少山飾大奶奶，言菊朋蕭長華飾二鄰居，侯喜瑞飾二奶奶，南鐵生飾相公。</p>
<h3>春陽妝唱第一聲</h3>
<p>— 鹿原學人</p>
<p>郭春陽此决公演，本定爲卡爾登，後以配角關係，復改隸黃金，英雄得用武之地，好男兒一現好身手，此其時矣。惟春陽從未在滬上露演，（僅於其師六十壽辰時，曾串定軍山一劇，此爲例外，）顧曲家多不識其技藝之如何，今就余曾觀過所演各戲中之特點，而爲他伶所無或不能者，略爲介紹二三於左，藉窺全豹。</p>
<p>（一）打棍出箱　爲純粹之譚派名奏，春陽於十齡時，即能是戲，經十餘年之鍛鍊，益覺爐火純靑，此劇計分問樵鬧府打棍出箱四折，唱念做均極繁重，與樵夫之問答，念白身段，具有戞戞獨造之處。閙府之唱工，打棍之表情，以及出箱之「鐵板橋」與見公差之甩髮，悉非下過苦功，深有根抵者不能。</p>
<p>（二）羣臣宴　此劇以唱念做見重於世，而擊鼓之鼓法，尤爲此戲最難之處。但最難者不在夜深沉一段，而在三通鼓，點子腕子，工力悉敵，輕重疾徐，抑揚高下，若網在綱，有條不紊，無倚偏倚重之弊。共慷慨激昂悲壯蒼凉處，直令聽者動容，四座皆驚，鼓技至此，足以壓倒一切，謂余不信，他日請騐。</p>
<p>（三）慶頂珠　此戲梅蘭芳在美演唱，頗博得彼邦人士之歡迎，蓋爲一種社會劇，情　甚佳，含意深刻也。以中國舊道理言之：所謂貧富不均，惡霸欺壓良民，以今日世界新潮流言之：即所謂階級鬥爭，勞資懸　殊，一壓榨，一反抗，美隊人即以此眼光觀此劇而枇評贊美此劇也。春陽演來，深符此旨，唱做之佳，自不待言；共與敎師對打一塲，有「反飛脚」之特技，爲他伶所不及，此外臉炙人口者，如定軍山，空城計，捉放，探母，戰太平，法門寺各劇等等，均有獨到之處，亦爲得意之作，必演之戲，恕不盡舉，請拭目以待可也。</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十三章　不肯低頭在草莽</p>
<p>許靖暗想這畜生公然跑到人家來騷擾了，左右是一隻狼，憑牠怎樣兇狠，我手中這口寳劍想還可以對付得過。吾則若被這畜生咬壞了坐騎，倒是很可惜的。於是他膽子一壯，開了門，挺劍奔出。這狼瞧見門裏有人走出，好似已被牠找到了目標，張開饞吻，舞起利爪，撲向許靖頭上來。許靖喝一聲「畜生休得撒潑，吃我一劍。將赤鳳劍刺向狼腹。那狼見了劍光，連忙悼轉身去，又一猛撲，撲到他足邊來。許靖將劍望下一掃，劍鋒刺中狼爪。那狼雖然受了傷，可是勇氣仍不减退，向許靖在咬。許靖將劍舞急了，和那巨狼猛撲。一人一狼，來往撲擊了十數回合，許靖早觀個間隙使個犀牛分水式，一劍刺去，正刺入巨狼的腹下，那狼慘叫一聲，跌翻在地下。許靖拔出寳劍，又在狼首上補了一劍，那狼直僵僵地死在血泊中了。許靖透了一口氣，把那狼拖起來，用繩子穿了，繫在大樹上，等柳隱英回來時，好向他報功。他方纔繫好後，忽聽對面崖壁上一聲叫嗥，他抬頭看時，見有兩頭狼奔向這裏而來，許靖一想，我和那死狼鬥得巳有些力乏，現在又有這兩頭狼來，萬一失疏，我這條性命死得却不値得，但若要關起門來時，倘然柳隱英回轉家門，瞧見了，豈不要給他笑我膽怯無用嗎？於是他從地下拾取了許多小石子，藏在袋裏，爬到門前一株大樹上去。剛纔坐定，那兩頭狼已飛奔到了樹下。他們見了死狼，又瞧着樹上的許靖，也知道他們自己的同伴便被這個人殺死的，所以一齊對着許靖大叫大跳，誓欲得之而甘心。（一二八）</p>

<h3>Addressing the Tense Situation in the Far East: Democratic Nations Adopt Parallel Measures; Dutch East Indies Announces Abolition of Oil Agreement with Japan; Japan Economically Isolated</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States and Britain are taking peacetime measures in the Far East, consulting frequently to discuss their objectives, and exchanging views with other independent nations concerned with the Far East. Welles declined to elaborate on the U.S. policy regarding oil shipments to Japan under the President's freeze order. Welles denied the existence of an agreement to buy up all of Mexico's oil production, but stated optimistically about the future resolution of gasoline and other issues between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 29th: British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, visited Undersecretary of State Welles in Washington to discuss economic plans to be adopted towards Japan. The British Ambassador told reporters that the situation in the Far East needs to be re-evaluated following Japan's advance into Vietnam and the swift retaliatory actions by Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th: According to reports from Batavia, the Dutch government has terminated the oil agreement concluded last year between the Dutch East Indies and Japan. Observers here are uncertain whether this move is merely a temporary response to the instability caused by the freezing of Japanese assets, or whether the Dutch East Indies plans to completely terminate the oil agreement to intensify its hostility towards Japan. However, they generally believe the Dutch East Indies is taking parallel action with Britain.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The "Asahi Shimbun" today strongly condemned the Dutch East Indies' move to freeze Japanese funds. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that this action is an undisguised rejection of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" built by Japan, and claimed that the Netherlands is participating in the encirclement of Japan. The newspaper said, "Japan must now take all necessary actions to address the problems caused by this move by the Netherlands. At the same time, it should destroy the Netherlands authorities' dream of despising Japan, who are wearing the skin of a British lion and the feathers of an American eagle."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The assets of Dutch and Dutch East Indies nationals in Japan have been frozen starting today. Currently, Japan's freezing action includes nationals of the U.S., the Philippines, Northern Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, and the Dutch East Indies residing in Japan.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 29th: Indications received here yesterday suggest that democratic nations may implement commercial and financial restrictions against Japan leniently. Well-informed observers say the U.S. and the Dutch East Indies will continue to issue transport licenses to Japan. It is estimated that President Roosevelt's intention is primarily to warn Japan, and he does not wish to be too hasty and force Japan to war. Furthermore, Japanese officials in London stated that current measures in Tokyo are limited to retaliating against Britain, the U.S., and the Netherlands, and will be implemented leniently. Japan does not intend to take aggressive actions against Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, or U.S. territories, and is unlikely to invade the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 9th: An official from the Ministry of Finance announced today that the relaxation of the freezing decree will depend on the circumstances. This indicates that Japan is temporarily not forming a definite policy, awaiting clarification of U.S. policy. Observers believe Japan will act according to the U.S. attitude: lenient if they are lenient, strict if they are strict.</p>
<p>United Press, Batavia, 29th: It was pointed out here today that the Japanese-Dutch currency agreement was officially terminated yesterday. This will result in the loss of 760,000 tons of unrefined oil and 546,000 tons of oil products annually, according to the Japanese-Dutch agreement signed last November. In the first four months of 1941, Japan purchased a total value of 29,600,000 Dutch guilders, likely exceeding last year's total of 101,000,000 tons. In the first four months of this year, the Dutch East Indies purchased goods from Japan worth 15,000,000 Dutch guilders.</p>
<p>Batavia, 28th: Japanese Consul-General to the Netherlands, Ishizawa, visited the Dutch East Indies Minister of Economic Affairs, Van Mook, at 12:30 PM on the 28th to hear his explanation regarding the issue of the President of the Java Bank, N. H. Aeckers, notifying the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank branch, Imagawa, on the night of the 17th, to suspend the Japanese-Dutch East Indies financial agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Since the Dutch East Indies followed the lead of Britain and the U.S. in freezing Japanese funds, Japan is now economically completely isolated. Its only remaining trade partners are the areas on the Asian continent controlled by Japan. It is generally expected that this situation will be quietly endured for the time being, but once the adverse effects become apparent, an explosion will erupt. The Asahi Shimbun claims that the Dutch East Indies froze Japanese funds due to the difficulties caused by the U.S. action, ostensibly as a defensive measure, but in reality, it clearly intends to act in concert with Britain and the U.S. Funds in Japan will soon be frozen. As for British and Canadian assets in Japan, they have already been frozen.</p>
<p>Mutual Freezing of Funds Between India and Japan; Japanese Goods Will Be Hit</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 29th: Well-informed sources predict that the mutual freezing of assets by the Indian and Japanese governments will completely halt trade between India and Japan. In the year ending March 31st, India's exports to Japan totaled £675,206, while imports from Japan totaled £1,616,100. Although neither the Indian nor Japanese government's freezing orders mentioned trade, goods currently awaiting shipment or already paid for between the two countries are unlikely to be affected. The Indian government's order does not apply to Japanese goods already paid for and ordered. Currently, no commercial treaty exists between India and Japan, but the commercial agreement stipulates that Japan must purchase cotton from India equal to the value of Japanese textiles imported into India. Notice has been given that this stipulation will terminate in six months.</p>

<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Mobil Oil Company stopped selling gasoline in Japan today because it has been unable to deposit payments received since the separate Japanese and U.S. travel freeze orders, and profits cannot be remitted. This move may only be temporary, pending clarification of the freezing decrees, but it will immediately cause greater hindrance to transportation in Japan. Well-informed sources expect taxis and private cars in Tokyo to decrease further, including those of the U.S. Embassy and consular officials. The government has reduced the amount of gasoline allocated to taxis for August to seven gallons.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Appointed Far East Commander; U.S. Senate Approves; MacArthur Discusses Integrating Philippine Army into U.S. Army with Quezon; U.S. Newspapers Express Satisfaction with MacArthur's Appointment</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 29th: General MacArthur, after discussing the integration of the Philippine Army into the U.S. Army with Philippine President Quezon yesterday, assumed the position of Commander of the U.S. Army in the Far East. It is believed that the Philippine Army's 1st Division and the chiefs of the Philippine constabulary will be integrated into the U.S. Army. The Philippines is scheduled to hold elections in November, at which time political activities are supposed to be lively, but this activity has been greatly relaxed due to the tense situation in the Far East. Members of Congress advocate convening a special session to amend the National Defense Act to limit reserve duty to 30 days of military drills per year. President Quezon recently telegraphed U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, welcoming the appointment of General MacArthur and declaring the Philippines' willingness to cooperate with the U.S. Leaders of the Socialist Party also jointly published an article declaring their support for the U.S. and their willingness to resist the enemies of the democratic nations under General MacArthur's command. Rumor has it that the U.S.-Japan Gentleman's Agreement, limiting the import of Japanese cotton goods into the Philippines, has been cancelled. U.S. officials stationed in the Philippines did not comment on this, only stating that the agreement will expire on August 1st.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 29th: Yesterday, the Washington Post's editorial stated that Lieutenant General MacArthur's appointment as Commander of the Far East Command is a warning to Japan. It also stated that President Roosevelt's move is a further warning in an emergency situation. If this is not enough, then the U.S. will defend its interests in the Far East. The Baltimore Sun's editorial stated that this appointment to the Philippine Army is sufficient to influence Japan or may sober Tokyo, because at this time, the Far East desperately needs sobriety and determination.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: The U.S. Senate yesterday unanimously approved the appointment of General MacArthur as a Lieutenant General to command the U.S. Army in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: Former Chief of Naval Operations Stanley claimed that the U.S. Navy is now prepared to assist in the defense of the Pacific and provide ample assistance to Britain to enable it to win the war in the Atlantic. Senator Pepper, a staunch supporter of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, expressed satisfaction with the President's appointment of General MacArthur as Commander of the U.S. Army in the Far East, stating that if Japan thinks it can march into the Philippines as easily as it did into Vietnam, it will encounter unexpected developments.</p>
<h3>U.S. Permits Japanese Ships to Export Freely; Not Affected by Freeze Order; Japanese Ship Leaves Canada with Timber</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: The U.S. has recently notified Japan that Japanese ships are permitted to depart quickly from U.S. ports. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, told reporters before visiting Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the freezing of Japanese assets in the U.S. that he knows Japanese ships are not affected by the freeze order. He hopes the State Department will clarify this and other issues.</p>
<p>International News Service, San Francisco, 29th: Forty Japanese ships, including the "Tatsuta Maru," which had been hesitating in the Pacific, afraid of being detained by the U.S., heard their destinations this morning. Welles has announced that Japanese ships are permitted to unload cargo in U.S. ports. The "Tatsuta Maru" carries raw silk worth $3.9 million and is destined for San Francisco.</p>
<p>Reuters, San Francisco, 29th: Japanese ships lingering off the coast are hesitant to enter U.S. ports. Some of them, including the "Tatsuta Maru," want assurances from the U.S. government that their cargo will not be detained. It is believed here that most Japanese ships must be lacking fuel and food. It is heard that the "Tatsuta Maru" carries a total of 59 British passengers, including the naval attaché of the British Embassy in Tokyo, Dufrenil, 32 Americans, and 139 Japanese.</p>
<p>International News Service, Vancouver, 29th: The Japanese ship "Florida Maru" left Vancouver yesterday carrying timber. This proves that although Canada has issued a freeze order, commerce between Japan and Canada has not been completely paralyzed. The Canadian authorities did not make any criticism when the ship left port. At the same time, customs officials are unloading cargo from the Panamanian ship "Boyaz," which, according to investigations, is carrying Canadian wheat intended for the occupied areas of China.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 29th: Sources here claimed yesterday that the Japanese ship "Matsumoto Maru" is still near Singapore, awaiting further clarification of the situation resulting from the British freezing of Japanese funds. An employee of the Nissin Company here said that the Hakone Maru will pass through here on Tuesday en route to Bombay. All of the ship's tickets were purchased by those departing from Singapore, making it the last Japanese ship to carry Japanese residents returning home.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 29th: The Japanese ships "Momebato Maru" and "Tomokawa Maru," scheduled to arrive here on a certain date, have not yet arrived. Their Bombay management office is trying to find out the reason for the ships' delay.</p>
<h3>British and Canadian Assets of Chinese Frozen; This Move is at the Request of China; To Strengthen Chinese Finances</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 28th: Following the lead of the United States, the British government, at the request of the Chinese government, has frozen Chinese assets in Britain. According to an official announcement made tonight, in order to aid China's financial position, the British Treasury, at the request of the Chinese government, has ordered the freezing of all pound sterling deposits and various assets in Britain belonging to residents in China. This order will take effect tomorrow morning. However, necessary funds for payments and various important transactions related to the Chinese government in the gold sterling group countries may still be withdrawn under special authorization.</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of the Army Establishes Recruiting Office</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Authorities announced that the Ministry of the Army has established a recruiting office to manage recruiting affairs, disseminate national defense knowledge regarding reservists, conduct school military training, and provide relief to retired soldiers.</p>
<p>New Zealand Takes Same Action as Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: Acting Prime Minister Nash announced that the New Zealand government is currently taking the same action towards Japan as Britain and the U.S., as New Zealand fully agrees with the actions taken by Britain and the U.S. New Zealand's exchange controls and trade regulations enable the necessary steps to be implemented in a simple and rapid manner. The New Zealand government has notified Japan that the New Zealand-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1819 will cease to be in effect three months after notification. Nash further discussed the impact of this step on Japan, stating that there will be a tense period ahead, but the New Zealand government has been in constant consultation with the British and other dominion governments. Today's decision may not result in a complete cessation of exchange transactions, but in order to ensure complete cooperation, it is hoped that every transaction, including those already underway, will be subject to scrutiny. Restrictions on remittances will be implemented immediately, which will bring trade with Japan to a near standstill, but the government does not intend to abolish the existing import and export licensing system.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Abolishing Agreement Highly Praised by the U.S.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 29th: Political figures here yesterday greatly praised Batavia's request for economic retaliation against Japan. This move was especially welcomed because it can serve as a solid front of resistance for many countries that have a significant stake in the critical South Asian region, where Japan is eager to expand its aggression. The current impression here is extremely strong that the countries in this region with a stake will form a united front against Japan's southward advance. At the same time, a warning has been issued to Japan that if Japan moves forward again, they will offer stronger resistance. According to experts, if Japan attacks the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, it will encounter a joint and unanimous pressure from all countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Davia, 29th: A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies government told the Legislative Council yesterday regarding changes in commercial relations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan that they will now seek to investigate what kind of barter trade the Dutch East Indies can conduct with Japan after developments in Vietnam, and investigate what basis this trade can be conducted on. It must be repeatedly stated that the Dutch East Indies government does not want to hinder Japan's business activities in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies government will pay as much attention as possible to this point when issuing necessary licenses for exports to Japan and Japanese-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Batavia, 28th: The Dutch East Indies government announced on the 28th the termination of the 1940 Japanese-Dutch oil agreement.</p>
<p>Japanese Privy Council Discusses Countermeasures Against Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>International News Service, Tokyo, 29th: The Japanese Privy Council met yesterday to decide how to deal with the economic war against Britain and the U.S. Finance Minister Ogura said that Japan's policy will depend on the actions of the U.S. government. It is heard that the Emperor also attended the meeting. The meeting lasted four hours, and government officials were questioned in detail on various issues. It was also revealed that the Japanese government acknowledged that it will use eight airfields in Vietnam, one of which is near Angkor, bordering Thailand.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Joins British and U.S. Front; Japan is Encircled; Will No Longer Be Able to Find Gasoline; Attacking Burma Also Faced with Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: The "Daily Telegraph" editorial today stated that the leaders of the Japanese military's advance into Vietnam knew that it would eventually cause consequences, but due to their recklessness, they could not heed good advice. However, those with clear heads in the country are deeply worried about the future. Since the Dutch East Indies joined the British and U.S. plan, the circle surrounding the Japanese military has actually been completed. Japan's future raw material needs are almost entirely dependent on Manchuria, China, and Vietnam, but these three places generally lack certain necessities of war, especially gasoline. It continued to discuss the retaliatory actions taken by Japan, saying that it is difficult for Japan to find any way to avoid suffocation, even resorting to force. However, unless its navy can control the South China Sea and occupy the East Indies and Thailand, it will be of no help. As for whether this new blockade will drive Japan to use force against the democratic nations, it remains to be seen. The "News Chronicle" published an article stating that Japan, which intended to accumulate war supplies in peacetime, may not wait until these war supplies are exhausted before engaging in acquiring hegemony in the Far East. Therefore, there may soon be action, or there may never be action. If it decides to stake its future on a gamble in the Pacific, it will find that the democratic nations are all prepared to wait.</p>
<p>Reuters, , 29th: The Times today published an article titled "Burma If Attacked," written by the newspaper's correspondent in Burma, which stated that Japan has long studied the possibility of attacking Burma from bases in Southeast Asia, which Japan can easily establish. The objective of this attack is mostly the Burma Road. During China's resistance war, the Japanese military was largely constrained and difficult to mobilize. It is estimated that their attack will likely pass through northern Thailand and advance along the Ledo Road (transliteration). If this succeeds, it can cut off important traffic to the south and then advance into Xipaw (transliteration) to control the road to Lashio and China. If the Japanese military attacks from the east, it will encounter natural obstacles, as the rainy season begins in this area in May, extending for six months, with rivers overflowing and towering mountain ranges and valleys intertwined, ranging from 800 to 8,000 feet above sea level. There are very few roads near the border, and those that exist are constantly available year-round. The Japanese military authorities are well aware of the geographical difficulties they will encounter, but they do not know the strength of the military they will encounter. In recent months, the military and equipment have greatly increased. This area is confident that it can prevent invasion. Anyone who wants to cut off China's traffic must attack northern Burma. Because the enemy may not necessarily attack from the north, Burma has long paid attention to this. However, the most serious danger is the advance through northern Thailand, the bombing of Bhamo and Lashio, and the attack from the sky. This offensive is not conducive to Burma, especially if the large number of supplies stockpiled in Bhamo and Lashio or road traffic are destroyed. The authorities have made every effort to strengthen the defense of this important location, but constant attention must be paid, as major is critical to the maintenance of China's lifeline.</p>
<h3>Citibank in Tokyo Continues to Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Citibank here is still pretending that officials from the Ministry of Finance are continuing to examine the bank's books. Deputy spokesman for the Cabinet Information Bureau Ishii declared that the bank will be allowed to resume operations, but the date is not yet set. The bank holds 17 million yen in Japanese currency belonging to U.S. depositors, 8 million yen of which belongs to U.S. film companies. U.S. film companies jointly decided today to unanimously stop supplying films in various parts of Japan, pending clarification of the freezing decrees. The Ministry of Finance told various inquirers that the limit for monthly withdrawals for people from countries whose funds have been frozen is no more than 500 yen, and so far, there have been no exceptions, nor has it been indicated whether there will be exceptions.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Economic Blockade and War</h3>
<p>In the 20th century, no country in the world can exist in isolation from international resource communication. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, British representative Eden launched an economic sanction against Italy in the League of Nations, but it failed. However, at that time, the Italian authorities had already shown a very panicked state. During the Spanish Civil War, Franco's victory in 1939 was due to the rebels' complete occupation of all seaports, coupled with the complete blockade by Britain and France of overseas aid to the government forces. As for the last European War, Germany's ultimate collapse was entirely due to the strict blockade by the Allied forces, which is universally recognized. Taking Japan as an example, it can actually establish a fairly strong military organization in such a resource-poor and narrow region. Its materials naturally come mostly from overseas: military plunder and economic competition are carried out simultaneously. The Sino-Japanese War has been fought for more than four years now, and it can still sustain itself because of the material replenishment exchanged through trade, the most important of which comes from the US, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies. If they had cut off the supply of raw materials to Japan earlier, it would be questionable how long Japan's limited reserves and resources could last.</p>
<p>The Western countries, Germany and Italy, attacked the Soviet Union due to miscalculations, and are now trapped in a desperate situation, completing a tight blockade circle for themselves. Their fate of failure is already doomed, it is only a matter of time. And their Eastern ally is now repeating the same mistake, disregarding the repeated warnings of Britain and the United States, and brazenly occupying Vietnam, which in one fell swoop triggered unanimous economic sanctions from Britain, the United States, the Dutch East Indies, etc. Originally, with the strong economic power of the US, British, and Dutch East Indies groups, the severity of this unanimous sanction against a country like Japan that completely relies on trade can be imagined. Just by looking at the complete stagnation of Japan's overseas shipping industry in the past two days, the fluctuations in the hearts of the people in its own country and its controlled areas, and the complete chaos in market prices, etc., one can immediately know. If the situation continues in the future, even setting aside military matters, economically, it will inevitably face a complete collapse one day.</p>
<p>However, in view of the rapid and profound effectiveness of this economic sanction against Japan, there seem to be two impressions that one cannot help but have: First, it is a pity that this sanction was not implemented earlier, otherwise, it would be questionable whether the world's aggressive forces could be as rampant as they are now. Second, this economic sanction, which has already been formally announced, is limited to the freezing of funds and the restriction of trade, and does not thoroughly implement a comprehensive economic severance and blockade, which is a shortcoming. From the perspective of the timing of the sanctions, at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, some people in the United States advocated economic sanctions against Japan to force it to abandon its aggression; and for four years, warnings have been constantly issued to Japan, urging it to respect the interests of the United States in the Pacific, otherwise, the United States would not need to resort to military action to put it in a difficult situation. However, why was this most effective weapon only taken out when the situation became so urgent today, instead of being used earlier? The United States cannot deny its responsibility for this delay. Now that economic sanctions have finally been implemented, the United States has made the greatest determination, and further measures can be implemented at any time. When the German military machine, which was invincible in military affairs and thought itself invincible, was once trapped in a tight blockade, it still presented a declining and inevitable defeat. Not to mention other smaller aggressive countries. Here, the Soviet Union's current firm action against Germany can serve as a reference for the United States. In the Pacific, there is no doubt that the only country that is qualified to imitate the Soviet Union's strong approach to combating aggressors in Europe is the United States.</p>
<p>Of course, because of the firm actions taken by Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies against aggressive forces, a cloud of war has emerged in the Pacific again. However, it seems too early to judge whether this cloud will bring storms or simply dissipate with the wind. Judging only from the situation, the most likely situation for the United States to be dragged into the war is when the Eastern and Western aggressive forces actually connect and join hands. To be specific, if Germany captures Suez and advances towards India, and at the same time Japan begins to move south and attack Singapore and other places, or if Germany captures Moscow and Leningrad, and Japan attacks Siberia, once these two situations occur, the United States will inevitably have to stand up and fight. However, the current actual situation is that not only is it difficult for the two groups of aggressive forces in the East and West to actually connect into one, but also the Western aggressors have already suffered unprecedented setbacks and are trapped in the core of a strong military and economic double barrier, and there is absolutely no way to break through the encirclement. Therefore, at this time, no matter what firm actions the United States takes in the East, given its powerful national strength, it would be truly beyond common sense to say that the Eastern aggressive forces would come to blows with it! Therefore, thoroughly economically blockading the aggressors in the East and West on the one hand, and making every effort to provide larger-scale assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the other hand, while mobilizing the navy, army, and air force to prepare for a war at all costs, these are the most reliable ways to keep the United States from being dragged into the vortex of war and to end the world war early.</p>

<p>Freezing Chinese Funds Highly Beneficial to China</p>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the British and American freezing of Japanese funds and the simultaneous freezing of Chinese funds, a reporter interviewed an official from the Ministry of Finance. The official stated that since the beginning of the War of Resistance, China has been unable to thoroughly manage foreign exchange due to its special circumstances, which has been exploited by speculators and capital flight. The government has repeatedly negotiated with friendly countries for assistance to achieve effective foreign exchange management. Now, friendly governments, at our request, have frozen our funds abroad. The meaning of this is completely different from freezing Japanese funds. Although our funds have been frozen, they can still be supplied by designated banks for legitimate purposes, and capital flight is prevented. Japanese funds cannot be disguised under Chinese names to evade restrictions. Therefore, this move by friendly governments is of great benefit to increasing China's foreign trade and managing foreign exchange. It further demonstrates the sincerity of friendly countries in assisting us. This matter concerns national interests, and our people can understand the significance of this move by friendly countries. Our financial and economic foundation will also become more stable from now on. (28th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Joint Defense of Vietnam, Franco-Japanese Agreement Signed, Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Land in Cam Ranh Bay, All Key Vietnamese Bases Occupied</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 29th: The Franco-Japanese Protocol was signed here at 11:00 a.m. this morning. The French representative was Cabinet Counselor and Foreign Minister Darlan, and the Japanese representative was the Japanese Ambassador to France, Kato. This protocol is the political foundation for the technical measures that France and Japan should take to jointly defend Vietnam. The full text is as follows: "The governments of France and Japan, in view of the current international situation, and recognizing that if the security of French Vietnam is threatened, Japan has reason to believe that the general peace of East Asia and the security of Japan itself are facing a crisis. Both sides take this opportunity to reaffirm the obligations previously accepted, namely, Japan promises to respect France's rights and interests in the Far East, especially the territorial integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty over all of Vietnam. As for France, it promises not to conclude agreements or understandings with any third country regarding Vietnam that stipulate methods of cooperation in political, economic, or military terms that would directly or indirectly put it in a position of opposition to Japan. It is therefore resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The governments of France and Japan agree to cooperate militarily to jointly defend French Vietnam. (2) Special measures should be established to implement the measures to be taken for this cooperation. (3) The above regulations shall continue to be effective only during the period when the circumstances for their adoption exist."</p>

It is generally expected that Japanese troops can land in Saigon and other naval bases today, but the Japanese army may have to wait until tomorrow to land in Saigon because the ships must wait for the tide tomorrow morning. Preparations have been made here this morning to welcome the Japanese troops. The docks and warehouses have mostly been cleared to allow the Japanese army to use them immediately.</p>
<h3>### Vichy Issues Statement to Cover Up Submission to Japan</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 28th: After France and Japan reached an agreement on the Vietnam issue, an official statement was issued as follows: "Although Japan is allowed to temporarily borrow the pier facilities of Haiphong port and concentrate troops and military supplies in certain places in Tonkin based on the Franco-Japanese agreement of September 5, 1940, this does not mean cession. Taking Haiphong as an example, although the Japanese army is allowed to borrow the pier gangways and various means of transportation within the prescribed period, the military and political power is still in the hands of France. There is a difference between cession and borrowing. Cession means the transfer of all sovereignty. As for borrowing, all sovereignty only changes with local and temporary influence. In addition, the invasion of Syria and the Vietnam incident are not related. As far as Syria is concerned, the British side carried out the attack without prior consultation with the French government and openly announced its intention to drive the French army out of Syria, and is now putting this intention into practice. Japan is the opposite. It explained its views in advance and conducted friendly negotiations with us to find an agreement. It solemnly declared that it would recognize the territorial integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty over all of Vietnam both at present and in the future. In other words, the country is deeply concerned about the disputes in the South Seas and asked us to provide convenience in military strategy and military affairs to protect its economy because Japan needs Vietnamese rice to maintain its people's food. To sum up, the convenience requested by Japan will take the following forms in the near future: (1) The Japanese army will be transferred from Tonkin to Annam and Cochin China. (2) The Japanese army will use Vietnamese highways and railways, for a period of several days. (3) The Japanese army will use various entrances in Vietnam. (4) Japanese troops will be stationed at locations selected by both sides. The above are the military impacts of the Franco-Japanese agreement. External propaganda intends to disrupt our people's minds, and the true situation should be told to the national media to clarify the truth."</p>
<h3>### Latin America to Launch Economic Offensive Against Japan, Based on the Pan-American Cooperation Agreement, Making it Impossible for Japan to Obtain Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 29th: Undersecretary of State Welles said yesterday that Latin America may cooperate with the United States in launching an economic offensive against Japan based on the current agreement between the United States and the American republics. At the same time, President Roosevelt, now at Hyde Park, has decided to return to Washington immediately to closely monitor the actions taken by the United States against Japan's expansion in the Pacific. The President is scheduled to arrive here on Sunday morning and intends to hold talks with Mr. Welles. Welles said that the agreement made by the United States is to purchase surplus military materials from Latin America and prevent certain goods shipped from the United States from being directly exported to other countries. The Undersecretary of State also said that this agreement makes it very difficult for Japan to obtain supplies from Latin America, but Japan has purchased cotton from Peru in the past and other raw materials from Brazil. Welles said that the United States and other interested parties exchange opinions from time to time and maintain contact to take parallel actions at any time to deal with Japan's actions in the South Pacific. The Undersecretary of State declined to comment on whether Japan may be able to purchase oil from Venezuela and other Latin American countries. He said that each country is an independent and free country and may act in accordance with its own national policies. Welles acknowledged that the United States has an agreement with Mexico to purchase all of the latter's surplus oil.</p>

<h3>### German Consul Expelled from San Francisco Transferred to Yokohama</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 29th: It is reported here that Captain Weitmann, the German Consul in San Francisco, will soon go to Yokohama to assume the position of Consul General after arriving here from the United States. Mr. Wei arrived in Lisbon from New York, then took a special car to here and then met with Ribbentrop. It is expected that after Mr. Wei is transferred to Yokohama as Consul General, the Nazis will increase pressure on the Japanese government and make Japan clearly express its opposition to democratic countries. It is rumored that Mr. Wei is a close friend of Führer Hitler and one of the most active Nazis stationed abroad. Mr. Wei's deployment to Japan shows that the German government attaches great importance to the Far Eastern situation.</p>

<h3>Red Army on All Fronts Launches Large-Scale Counter-Offensive; Army and Air Force Cooperate to Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Moscow and Kyiv Turn from Danger to Safety</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th. Soviet sources recently announced that in the central sector of the Rzhev-Vyazma-Bryansk area (directly facing Moscow) and the southern front of the Tomilka area (directly facing Kyiv), German forces are being strongly resisted by Soviet troops, and their offensive is now cracking. Soviet forces are now launching fierce counter-offensives in many places, inflicting heavy damage on enemy forces. However, there are no other significant battles to report in other areas. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, attacked concentrated large groups of enemy troops and enemy aircraft on airfields. On July 26th, 101 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets lost 36 aircraft. Coastal defense forces and naval aviation in the Baltic region sank one enemy torpedo boat and two patrol boats. The Soviets also lost one large torpedo boat.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Soviet sources reported that fierce fighting continued in the Smolensk, Tomilka, and Nevel areas. The news is essentially no different from yesterday's announcements. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with ground troops, continued to attack important enemy concentrations. News regarding the siege of Leningrad is contradictory. German sources claim that the Leningrad area has been surrounded, and Finnish forces have advanced to the outskirts of the city. However, a Swiss newspaper reporter stated that German forces operating south of Leningrad have been forced to retreat to Novgorod. Strong reserve forces have joined the battle, and German and Finnish forces are still at least 90 kilometers away from Leningrad. According to neutral sources heard by Reuters, the Germans underestimated the enemy's strength and are now experiencing supply shortages.</p>
<p>Reuters, Zurich, 29th. The "Basler Nachrichten" reported from Berlin that the most intense fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front has undoubtedly come to a standstill. Messages from the front lines indicate that German infantry are forced to hold their positions in trenches to defend against Soviet counter-offensives. On July 7th, the German Army High Command announced that the Soviets had deployed their last reserves. Now, the German side is contradicting itself, saying, "Soviet forces have recently received reinforcements from the Ural region." To further explain this, it stated, "The previous German announcement naturally did not include the Ural region." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung explained the reason for the German offensive being stalled, stating, "The great battle against the strongest Bolshevik forces is currently underway, so that the German Army can continue its war operations." Two weeks ago, the Basler Nachrichten reported from Berlin that Berlin expected Kyiv to fall within "a few hours." However, Kyiv remains unharmed.</p>
<h3>Northern Red Army Well-Commanded, Half of Enemy Division Annihilated</h3>
<p>TASS, War Zone Report, 29th. On June 29th, a German-Finnish infantry division began an offensive in a certain area "attempting to seize it." The battle lasted until July 11th. The enemy's repeated attacks were defeated by the forces commanded by Army Colonel Trubachev. The war lasted for 13 days, and the result was a complete victory for the Soviet troops. Half of the advancing enemy force was annihilated. The enemy not only failed to occupy the objective but also had to gather its remaining troops and flee. Army Colonel Trubachev is a veteran of the Civil War, who has repeatedly demonstrated courage and set an example, inspiring Red Army soldiers. This battle further proves him to be a resolute and strong-willed Red Army commander. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has specially awarded him the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>United Press, Stockholm, 29th. Yesterday, local news reports reported the sound of heavy artillery fire, believed to indicate naval warfare between Germany and the Soviet Union, or the Soviet bombing of German positions along the Estonian coast. In Gotland, clear sounds of artillery fire have been heard every five to ten minutes since Sunday.</p>
<h3>Difficult Terrain in Forest Areas, Nazis Admit to Arduous Combat</h3>
<p>Reuters, Zurich, 29th. Official German sources explain the slow progress on the Eastern Front by citing the difficulties encountered by the German forces. A Berlin dispatch from a newspaper in Bern described the situation on the Soviet-Finnish front: "On this front, German troops, heavily laden, advance in columns, winding through seemingly endless forests. There are no roads for transportation in the forests, and motorized vehicles are not suitable. Therefore, the troops carry only the absolutely necessary equipment. Although the nights are very cold, the troops do not carry coats or blankets. During the day, it is hot and humid, and swarms of mosquitoes fly around, causing the troops considerable suffering. They are also often hindered by mud, sinking to their knees. These forests provide the best cover for the Soviet forces, which the German forces cannot see. Therefore, as soon as the German troops enter the forest, they are quickly ambushed by Soviet forces hidden in the thickets. Another difficulty is the excellent camouflage of the Soviet artillery positions, making them difficult to detect from afar. Mines are buried everywhere around the artillery positions."</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Warfare at a Standstill, German Timetable Useless</h3>
<p>International News Service, Istanbul, 29th. A well-informed foreign military expert here told reporters yesterday that the German forces have lost at least 6,000 armored vehicles and 700,000 soldiers in this all-out attack on the Soviet Union. He stated, "I can assert that Soviet resistance has completely overturned German calculations and shattered their plans. Several months ago, I learned that the German High Command was ordered to estimate the time required for the invasion of the Soviet Union. The High Command replied that a complete breakthrough would be achieved three weeks after the launch, and the entire campaign would be completed in at most six weeks. Today, I strongly disbelieve the estimates of these generals. I believe the Soviet Union still has more troops to deploy to the battlefield. Although the Germans claim to have occupied the important Soviet town of Smolensk, the area still appears to be the center of a major battle. The Germans have admitted to Soviet counter-offensives, which indicates that the Soviet forces still hold positions, and their combat effectiveness is not weak. The Soviet forces have equipment that is not inferior to the German forces, and they are able to mobilize more forces."</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Attack Soviet Capital Again Unsuccessful, Port of Odessa Continues to Be Attacked</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th. According to TASS, a total of 140-150 German aircraft attacked Moscow on Monday night. Their formations were dispersed by the combined Soviet anti-aircraft fire and night pursuit aircraft, so only four or five aircraft slipped into the city. According to initial reports, nine German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets lost one aircraft. The German aircraft that reached the city dropped bombs indiscriminately, causing a fire in one place, which was quickly extinguished. Several people were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 28th. Official sources announced tonight that the German Air Force bombed the Soviet port of Odessa in southern Ukraine several times last night. The docks there were hit and caught fire.</p>
<h3>Churchill Warns the Nation Not to Relax Vigilance; Naval and Air Forces Hold Dominant Positions, Production of War Equipment Proceeding According to Plan</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Prime Minister Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons today, warned the British people that the enemy's invasion season is approaching again, and all armed forces must be vigilant in a timely manner. The Prime Minister also stated that it is indeed a fact that the German air superiority has been shattered. British fighters are now in a better position than during the Battle of Britain. The production of bombers in Britain alone has doubled, and next year it will double again, and in the six months after that, it will triple the current output. In the past three months, the production of munitions has increased by one-third compared to the Dunkirk era. Currently, the tonnage of warships and merchant ships being built is greater than at any time during the last World War.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Prime Minister Churchill, beginning the production debate in the House of Commons today, declared that although we are not an omnipotent nation, we are now working to make ourselves a complete war machine. Rumors that any confusion has occurred in British war equipment production are untrue. In the first three months of this year, in his capacity as Minister of Defense, he drafted and revised a general plan for the War Cabinet, bringing together the entire program for the production and import of British munitions and indicating the path it should follow. He discussed this plan with various cabinet members and the leaders of the three armed forces and had it studied by statisticians. This general plan was finally given final approval by the War Cabinet in March of this year. He can guarantee that the various agencies controlling production currently have no disputes over the priority rights of labor, raw materials, and factories. As for the fact that some planes ordered from the United States could not be used because they did not have accessories, as was said during the last debate, it is not true. It must be known that the planes ordered by Britain are accompanied by various parts. This misunderstanding was largely caused by the fact that after the collapse of France, the British aircraft production department received a batch of aircraft ordered by France, all of which were not suitable for use in Britain. They could only be used after being refitted.</p>
<h3>Britain Determined Not to Easily Make Peace with Germany; Eden Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in London today, saying that Germany seems likely to launch a "peace blitz" against Britain soon, but any peace concluded with Hitler will be difficult to make permanent. We are determined to destroy Hitler's regime and hope that the United States will cooperate with us after the war to jointly maintain the peace we have achieved. Hitler's timetable for defeating the Soviet Union has lost its usefulness.</p>
<h3>Britain Severs Relations with Finland</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 28th. The Foreign Office has just announced that Britain has severed diplomatic relations with Finland.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Responsible sources in London claim that Finland has requested the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain. The Finnish Foreign Minister recently presented a supplementary memorandum to the British Minister to Finland, stating that since Finland is fighting alongside Germany, normal diplomatic relations between Britain and Finland can hardly be maintained. The British Minister then asked if this meant that Finland was requesting the severance of diplomatic relations, to which the Finnish Foreign Minister replied in the affirmative.</p>
<h3>Huge U.S. National Defense Budget, Totaling 80 Billion Yuan, Passed by the House and Sent to the Senate</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th. The U.S. $8,063,000,000 national defense appropriation bill was passed by the House last night and sent to the Senate. It includes funds for the equipment and supplies of 1,727,000 Army personnel and $4,760,000,000 for the emergency recruitment of 3,000,000 personnel. In addition to $1,569,000,000 for the Navy Department, the Foreign Affairs Committee also received $1,609,000,000 to build 541 cargo ships and acquire 350 ships.</p>
<h3>Hess' Confidant, Haushofer, Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th. Wireless dispatches from Moscow state that according to reliable sources in Geneva, Professor Karl Haushofer, Hitler's right-hand man, the National Socialist Party's mastermind, and the inventor of terms such as "Lebensraum" (living space) and "Führer," has committed suicide in a concentration camp in Bavaria. Since the 1920s, Haushofer had influence over Hitler, but since Hess fled to England, Haushofer was placed under house arrest and soon transferred to a concentration camp. It is said that Haushofer made many contributions to the political theories in Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." In his youth, Haushofer traveled throughout Europe, India, Siberia, China, and Japan.</p>

<h3>Implementation of Frozen Funds; American Banks Receive Instructions; Maintain Normal Operations and Continue to Purchase Foreign Currencies; Regulations for Applying for Foreign Exchange for Trade</h3>
<p>Since the UK and the US successively announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, banks of friendly nations in Shanghai initially kept silent on the matter. As for implementation methods, they stated they hadn't received orders from their governments, so they couldn't make announcements. However, American commercial banks received Implementation Instructions No. 58 and No. 59 yesterday morning. The frozen funds implementation measures stipulated are stricter than most people previously anticipated. As for the special note concerning Sino-American trade, it doesn't mean that the four authorized banks can freely provide exchange for trade; it only provides exchange for normal American imports and exports. The policy of American commercial banks in this city is to continue to purchase foreign currencies from sellers of any nationality to avoid the situation from fundamentally changing from what it was last Saturday morning, when the freezing order was issued. Banking circles believe that the exchange market situation is still "more buying" because most importers are eager to obtain American goods.</p>
<p>Restricting Measures</p>
<p>American commercial banks received general notes No. 58 and No. 59, which were issued respectively based on the freezing of American exchange funds for China and Chinese funds in the United States. Under these instructions, Chinese funds will be frozen or blocked. As for general note No. 58 concerning the freezing of American exchange funds for China, it stipulates that "A" trade in any part of the United States and China (excluding Manchuria) must meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(1) This kind of trade must not be operated by, or entrusted to be managed by, or be related to (1) blocked countries other than China, or (2) people living in Manchuria, or (3) people of blocked countries other than China (not including those living in China).</p>
<p>(2) This kind of trade must not involve the interests or property of blocked countries (excluding China), the people of Manchuria today, or people of blocked countries other than China (excluding those living in China) (from the effective date of the instructions or at any time).</p>
<p>(3) Trade applying for foreign exchange must meet the following two conditions: (1) This kind of trade must be bona fide imports and exports, legal and normal, and the value of its imports or exports must be equivalent to the total amount of foreign exchange applied for; (2) This kind of import and export must comply with all the provisions of this note.</p>
<p>"B" Banks in the United States that have been approved and authorized by this note must immediately maintain a monthly report from the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, which contains the details of the trade regulations during this period, including the detailed rules related to this type of trade, including evidence methods for loan accounts related to this type of trade.</p>
<p>"C" The people referred to in this note as "living in China" refer to those who have been in China and doing business in China since June 14, 1941.</p>
<p>(1) The banks authorized to operate this kind of trade under special notes are Chase Bank, Citibank, American Allied Bank, American Express, Moscow National Bank, Commerzbank, HSBC, Banque de l'Indochine, David Sassoon &amp; Co., New Sassoon, Mercantile Bank, Dutch Bank, Banca dell'Asia, and Davidsassoon &amp; Co., a total of fourteen banks. (2) The banks specially approved by this note are authorized to provide foreign exchange for trade between any part of China (excluding Manchuria) and the following countries: (1) the United States, (2) the Americas (as stipulated in Note No. 93), (3) the British Empire, (4) the Soviet Union, and (5) the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Foreign Commercial Banks Maintain Shanghai Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee does not adopt public methods to maintain the Shanghai exchange rate and supply foreign exchange for the legitimate needs of various industries. Instead, it authorizes friendly banks to secretly maintain the exchange rate at a natural level. If various industries really need foreign exchange for legitimate reasons, they can purchase it from banks dealing in foreign exchange. However, each bank must review and approve the purchaser to avoid being deceived by speculators and falling into the hands of Japanese merchants. At the same time, adjust the spot and near-term exchange rates to prevent foreign exchange arbitrage. The application for statutory foreign exchange is limited to various free areas. Since Shanghai has a special environment, the Chinese government cannot control all trade. To enhance effectiveness, the above methods are adopted.</p>
<p>Measures for Applying for Statutory Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Regarding the application for statutory foreign exchange in free areas, it is stipulated that importers who operate on imported goods that are not on the prohibited import list and are necessary for China can apply to purchase them. They should specify the use, name of the goods, quantity, value, port of departure and date, import location, sales location, currency and amount of application. Those approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee will be sold by the China Bank or Bank of Communications at the statutory price. However, the applicant must pay a balance fee equal to the difference between the statutory price and the listed price of the China Bank and Bank of Communications. When the foreign exchange purchase is completed, the applicant should send the special foreign exchange purchase notification to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for cancellation. However, statutory foreign exchange is not allowed to be applied for for luxury and semi-luxury goods.</p>
<p>Chinese Commercial Banks Quietly Await Ministry Orders</p>
<p>The Chinese commercial banks that operate in foreign exchange (excluding the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank) are Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Commercial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, East Asia Bank, Chung Foo Union Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, National Goods Bank, Guohua Commercial Bank, Zhongxing Bank, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Ken Ye Bank, Enterprise Bank, etc. Regarding future foreign exchange business, they have already requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance. As soon as they receive the ministry order, they will follow it. Before receiving orders, they will take temporary measures to deal with foreign exchange accounts. It is expected that a formal order will be received within the day. It is also heard that regarding the foreign exchange of various industries and individuals that have been frozen, if they are truly needed for legitimate reasons, such as purchasing necessary goods from abroad and foreign tuition fees, they may submit a request to the Chinese government or the British and American embassies in the UK and the US, requesting them to forward it to the British and American governments for accommodation.</p>
<p>Financial Markets Gradually Stabilize</p>
<p>The Shanghai market yesterday was not like the previous day, under the crashing waves. Instead, it has gradually stabilized. The British HSBC Bank's Black Mountain foreign exchange listing was the same as the previous day. Actual transactions: (1) Spot exchange and July-August futures closed at 3 and a half pence at 15.625; (2) Spot American exchange and July-August futures closed at 5.21875 yuan. British and American foreign exchange rates each increased by 0.0625. The gold market has fallen back. The morning closing was 6,645 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 6,673 yuan. As for the various commodity markets, the prices of various commodities have fallen back. However, the drastic changes in foreign stocks and cotton prices are due to the tightening international situation and the problems of the Jianghai Customs prohibiting exports.</p>
<h3>Scope of Customs Embargo Expanded, Reaching Eleven Types; Goods Already Loaded on Three British Ships Unloaded; Chinese and Foreign Merchants Suffer Major Burden</h3>
<p>Under the command of Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Customs Akayama Zuke, the Jianghai Customs in this city, in response to the Japanese government's retaliatory actions against the UK and the US for freezing the funds of Japan and the occupied areas of China, issued a notice from the General Affairs Section by Japanese customs officer Oyamada to prohibit the export of many commodities to foreign countries (excluding Japan) or the free areas of China. Therefore, the import and export trade of British, American, and other friendly nations in this city has suddenly become chaotic and uneasy, and Chinese merchants' businesses will also encounter an unprecedented crisis. Yesterday was the first day after the embargo. The trade market was chaotic. Chinese and foreign people in this city believe that if this continues, major international disputes will inevitably occur. They are all paying close attention to the future.</p>
<p>Embargoed Items Reach Eleven Types</p>
<p>It was previously reported that there were only eight types of goods under customs embargo. However, according to reporters' inquiries yesterday, its scope has been expanded and has reached as many as eleven types. In addition to the machinery, grains, cereals, feed, oils, chemical products, fertilizers, gauze, minerals, and metals reported yesterday, the three newly added types are cotton, medicinal materials, and pigments. The above-mentioned eleven items have been embargoed since the afternoon of the previous day. Various customs brokers who went to request export declarations with the items listed in the notice were rejected for clearance, and the English notice issued by Oyamada was posted on various customs declaration counters. Merchants who witnessed this scene had to swallow their anger and return reluctantly. As a result, exports were stagnant, causing great inconvenience.</p>
<p>Three British Ships Forced to Unload</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs embargo notice was issued, prohibiting embargoed goods from being shipped to Hong Kong and Rangoon, foreign merchant ships have suffered a great blow. Yesterday afternoon, the Hunan and Qiongzhou ships for export had only loaded a small amount of general merchandise for Hong Kong beforehand. Unexpectedly, they were immediately detained and had to completely unload the items. The Hunan ship went to Hong Kong empty, while the Qiongzhou ship went to Siam via Shantou and Hong Kong. Oils, textiles, cotton yarn, hardware, and other items shipped to Siam were loaded and exported as usual. Also, Yisheng Shipping Company's Yuxin ship, scheduled to sail directly from this city to Hong Kong this morning, had all the Hong Kong goods declared beforehand returned and unloaded yesterday. Therefore, it is also scheduled to sail to Hong Kong empty this morning.</p>
<p>Names of Embargoed Items Not Yet Disclosed</p>
<p>It is found that Jianghai Customs prohibits the export of goods including machinery, food, oils, chemicals, grains, feed, fertilizers, cotton, metals, minerals, dyes, and medicines. Yesterday (the 19th) morning, a large number of merchants waited in Jianghai Customs to get the list of goods that the Japanese side prohibited from exporting from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Various Businesses Are Burdened</p>
<p>The immediate impact of the export embargo is not yet known, but business circles believe that this new restriction will impose a major burden on various businesses in Shanghai. It is said that although the situation in Shanghai has been extremely turbulent in recent years, local commerce has been quite prosperous due to the increase in exports and the acquisition of large amounts of foreign exchange. Today, hindered by this embargo, it will naturally feel great difficulty. It is generally expected that the real impact of the embargo will not be felt until more detailed knowledge of the implementation of the embargo is known.</p>
<p>Machinery and Metals Were Restricted Earlier</p>
<p>After the Japanese authorities implemented the ban on the export of metals and other items, it was heard that in the future, export applications would be reviewed by Japanese customs officials in Jianghai Customs. The restriction on machinery and metals did not shock business people, because although Jianghai Customs had not formally banned the export of machinery and metals, some carriers had difficulty applying to Jianghai Customs for the necessary permits to transport these two types of goods for some time.</p>
<p>American Businesses Unaffected</p>
<p>According to responsible American sources here, there are almost no American commercial firms in Shanghai engaged in the export of the above-mentioned goods. Therefore, American businesses here will not be affected by the Japanese ban, and American business circles do not take this as a concern. For the past four years, the Japanese have discriminated against foreign trade in China, including American commerce. The recent move by the Japanese side has little effect on American businesses.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund: Review of Academic Standards - Selection Based on the High or Low Grades of Major Subjects; Examination Method May be Implemented in the Next Issue</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund campaign, everything has progressed as expected, such as the successful fundraising and the application deadline of only seven days. Soon, a field investigation of the family circumstances of qualified student applicants will be conducted, and it is expected that the matter can be handled by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donations</p>
<p>Yesterday's donations came from the following individuals: Qu Zhibu Hospital, 60 yuan; Sha Nianhan, 10 yuan; Gu Huilin, little brother, 10 yuan; Gu Peizhen, little sister, 10 yuan; Gao Yunbiao, 5 yuan; Xu Bin, 5 yuan; also from Xu Bin's fundraising: Xu Mei, 4 yuan; Lei Fen, [amount missing] yuan; Lei Feng, 2 yuan; Lei Peng, 2 yuan; Lei Fang, 2 yuan; Lei Hua, 2 yuan; Xu Dao, 1 yuan. The total amount is 115 yuan. With the previous balance of 15,322 yuan and 52 cents, the grand total is 15,437 yuan and 52 cents. (The 20 yuan donation from Yao Ruojuan was omitted in the previous issue but has been included in the total.)</p>
<p>Answering Questions</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Jin Liyi sent a letter to this newspaper, the gist of which can be divided into two points: (1) The scholarship regulations stipulate that the main subjects must have a score of 80, while the average must be 70. This is not very realistic, because students in each school who like science will inevitably be weaker in liberal arts, and vice versa. It is not easy to require all subjects to be good. (2) The grading standards of various schools in Shanghai vary, so 80 cannot be used as the standard. It is hoped that the results can be determined by examination. Mr. Jin's opinion has some merit. However, this newspaper has carefully considered this issue from the beginning and deeply feels that determining qualifications is fraught with various difficulties. The final decision is that a score of 80 in the main subjects and an average of 70 is required to qualify. Elementary schools have six or seven subjects, while middle schools have nearly ten subjects. Therefore, we only focus on a few major subjects, because these major subjects are the basic knowledge for further education, and a score of 80 is necessary to hope for further study. For students above the level of specialized schools, the grades of the major subjects in the major department will be used as the standard. Please pay special attention to this point, Mr. Jin, and do not misunderstand. Those who study science only need to have a score of 80 in the main science subjects to qualify. Even if the grades in other subjects are poor, it does not matter. Other subjects can be inferred by analogy. Regarding the second point, although the regulations of each school are not fixed, they are a minority and will be handled with discretion. Using examinations to determine the results is indeed the best method and may be adopted in the future.</p>
<p>Candy Scholarship</p>
<p>Our newspaper's young reader, Xu Bin, wrote a letter saying, "To the editor of Shen Bao: I read in your newspaper that you are launching a scholarship fund to demonstrate your enthusiasm for education and benefit the poor. I deeply admire you. I am also a student, and my family can afford the cost of education. However, I sympathize with those who are forced to drop out of school due to financial difficulties. I regret that I am unable to provide much assistance. Now that your newspaper has this charitable undertaking, I am donating 5 yuan in legal tender that I saved from transportation expenses, and 15 yuan in legal tender that I raised from my younger siblings, some of whom donated their scholarship money, and some of whom saved from candy money. This small amount is just a token of my support." The compassion of these children is gratifying. I wish them all the best in their future studies and hope that they will work hard to create benefits for the country, society, and humanity.</p>

<p>Yangtze River Ships to be Requisitioned</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that there have been rumors recently that the Japanese army may requisition Japanese ships sailing on the Yangtze River. Yesterday afternoon (the 28th), Japanese travel agencies on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession did not specify the exact date of departure of Japanese ships from Shanghai, which seems to corroborate the above rumors. Several Japanese ships are scheduled to sail to Hankou before the end of this month.

<h3>Shanghai Society's Mentality: Permanently in Flux; Excerpts from a Talk by Mrs. Kamaladevi</h3>
<p>Mrs. Kamaladevi, a member of the Indian National Congress (see picture), arrived in Shanghai from the United States last week and will soon go to the provisional capital. A reporter visited her residence yesterday with a camera, and Mrs. Kamaladevi told him her impressions of Shanghai after her stay here. The reporter summarized them into several points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The mentality of Shanghai society seems to have no permanent and stable plan and is always in flux. (2) The policy adopted by capitalist countries in Shanghai is to exploit and oppress, with the sole purpose of seeking their own interests. Once they have gained both fame and fortune, they return to their country fully loaded, and regard Shanghai as worn-out shoes, never thinking about the future development of Shanghai. (3) The salaried class and the laboring class in Shanghai are groaning under the pressure of capitalists, just like the situation in Indian society. The Shanghai Concession authorities only focus on labor-management mediation and part of the work of child protection.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kamaladevi has traveled to various European and American countries and has a deep understanding of the European war. She believes that the future of democratic countries is bright and is optimistic about the future of India after independence.</p>
<p>Before leaving Shanghai, Mrs. Kamaladevi agreed to give a public speech at the invitation of the Chinese-Western Friendship Association organized by international figures in this port. The topic is "New Trends in India" (祖 )</p>

<h3>Foreman of the Public Works Department, Zhu Chengshan, Kidnapped Yesterday; Bandits Intercepted Car at Yanping Road Intersection Early in the Morning; Drove Away After Forcing the Driver Out</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case occurred on Yanping Road, Connaught Road, in western Shanghai yesterday morning. The victim was Zhu Chengshan, foreman of the Yanping Road Works Department of the Public Works Department (some say chief engineer). The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Work</p>
<p>Zhu Chengshan, a Ningbo native, 37 years old, lives at No. 6, Lane 299, Seymour Road (Shiyingli). He is a foreman at the Public Works Department and goes to the Yanping Road Works Department every day as usual. The department also sends an official car (No. 15266) to pick him up and drop him off, which is the usual practice. Yesterday morning at 5:30, Zhu had breakfast and got into the car because it had arrived and drove to work.</p>
<p>Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the car reached Connaught Road and was about to turn onto Yanping Road, three or four kidnappers suddenly stopped the car and threatened the driver with guns. The bandits then rushed into the car, forced the driver to drive west quickly, and then forced the driver out of the car, and the bandits drove away, kidnapping Zhu without a trace. After watching the car leave, the driver returned to the department to report and notified Zhu's family.</p>
<p>Lost Car Found</p>
<p>After receiving the report from the Public Works Department and Zhu's residence, the police immediately ordered detectives to investigate and notified all police stations to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. It was not until 11:30 AM that the official car No. 15266 was found near Anhe Temple Road, Rue Cardinal Mercier, in western Shanghai. The department sent someone to drive it back. It was learned that Zhu had received a threatening letter some time ago.</p>

<p>Shi Quanfu, a local resident living at No. 792 Rue de Bayle in the French Concession, 32 years old, has been a machine copper craftsman for a long time and is a deputy foreman in the copper workshop of the French tram company. He has been targeted by enemies twice before, once shot and once axed, but luckily he only suffered minor injuries and escaped death. Unexpectedly, at 6:30 yesterday morning, Shi had just gotten up and was washing his face when another assailant, dressed in white shorts and trousers, broke in while Shi's family was unprepared and fired a shot at Shi's back. The bullet hit Shi's head, and he fell to the ground in pain. When his family heard the noise and rushed over, the assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled without a trace. The family reported to the French police station, and they sent detectives to investigate and sent Shi to Kwong Chi Hospital. It is reported that although his injuries are serious, if there are no complications, his life may be saved. The police have ordered detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitive and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: According to Mr. Li Songshou, the party concerned, he recently read in the news column of the 29th Shen Bao, "Negotiating Film Advertisement to Defraud the Reader's Trial," which is inconsistent with the facts. It is verified that I neither work as an advertisement runner nor am I employed by Yindu Company. This lawsuit is because Yindu Company contracted the slide film of Sanping Theater to me first, and then reneged on the contract. Because I failed to recover the deposit, I used the police station to falsely accuse me of embezzlement. After my defense lawyers Wang Yaotang and Pingheng submitted important evidence to the court and exposed the plaintiff's shady background, the court adopted it and scheduled a continuation trial on the 30th. This is the actual situation of the case. Now I read in the newspaper that "fraud in the name of negotiating for debts... 2,500 yuan" and other sentences are obviously inconsistent with the facts and are related to my reputation. With this in mind, please correct it in your newspaper and publish the original letter as a correction. Sincerely, the Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Pingheng, July 29.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers' Lives in the Time of National Crisis: Wrongly Aimed Goals; Lecture by Huang Jingwan</h3>
<p>The Youth-Affiliated Elementary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society's summer meeting invited Huang Jingwan, a social improvement practitioner, to speak on the goals of the economic lives of elementary school teachers in the time of national crisis. The following is an excerpt from the speech recorded by the Dahua News Agency reporter: (A) Do not add new clothes, shoes, and hats unless absolutely necessary, and try to avoid using foreign materials; (B) Usually abstain from smoking, drinking, gambling, and banquets, replace wine with tea, do not use imported food, and abstain from unnecessary social engagements, and promote vegetarianism; (C) The rent should not exceed 30% of the income in principle, organize small families, and do not add necessary furnishings; (D) Advocate walking or taking public trams and buses; (E) Except for the funerals of direct relatives or spouses, do not issue obituaries. Except for the marriage of yourself or your children, do not issue invitations. The invitations issued are limited to close relatives and friends. The wedding and funeral ceremonies should be as simple as possible. No gifts are given during the holidays; (F) Advocate proper entertainment. At any time, you should not enter dance halls to play cards, and abstain as a principle. Limit yourself to one or two movies per month. After work, enter a proper group, read books and newspapers, play music, practice calligraphy and painting, play chess, listen to lectures, watch exhibitions, visit good teachers and helpful friends, visit and learn production skills, visit parks, and stroll on the streets. People who have not yet become independent should also follow the economic life, be self-reliant, and organize a customs improvement association. I hope that people from all walks of life will save useful money to run people's livelihood and welfare undertakings, so as to help poor teachers with loans or scholarships for outstanding youth. I hope that colleagues in elementary education will stand up and put it into practice.</p>

<p>Academic Lectures</p>
<h3>The Memory Method for Reading (I)</h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>If we only have perception and cannot remember, we cannot form a conscious life. Because of this, we cannot help but accumulate old experiences from perception to promote the generation and formation of new experiences. Moreover, the notions caused by perception always come from past experiences. With that kind of notion, perception has meaning. Learning and memory are clearly two aspects of the same thing. Learning is change and promotion, and memory is preservation. Because there is preservation, there is change and promotion. As for reading, everyone knows the necessity of memory.</p>
<p>1.  Stages of Memory</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss the relationship between memory and reading as follows: The stages of memory can be divided into four points: (1) impression, (2) grasping, (3) recollection, and (4) recognition.</p>
<p>(1) Impression: Whenever something from the outside world is received and forms a kind of sensory knot, this sensory knot is called an impression. This impression must have good qualities when it is absorbed in order to help memory with good influences. When reading, it is best to pay attention to concentration; otherwise, after reading, no impression will be gained in the brain.</p>
<p>(2) Grasping: Once the impression has been absorbed, it should be preserved and not forgotten. This is what is called grasping. If the impression comes but is not grasped, the impression will be lost as soon as it arrives and cannot be preserved at all.</p>
<p>(3) Recollection: All things or materials that have been impressed and preserved are sometimes recalled because of current needs. This is what is called recollection.</p>
<p>(4) Recognition: When something or material that has already been impressed and preserved is sometimes recalled, a kind of emotion occurs. The occurrence of this emotion is the emotion of recognition.</p>
<p>2.  Conditions of Memory</p>
<p>Memory is based on the habits of the nervous system. The nervous system's response to certain things becomes a habit, and then it can be remembered. According to physiological relationships, memory must have the following four conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Memory is proportional to new and old concepts. Newly acquired concepts are easily regenerated, and the regenerated impressions are also clear. As for old concepts, it depends on the length of time. The longer the distance of the acquired concepts, the more difficult the regeneration; the closer the distance, the easier the regeneration.</p>
<p>(2) Memory is proportional to the decisiveness of learning. The more decisive the learning, the easier the memory; otherwise, memory is more difficult.</p>
<p>(3) Memory is proportional to the strength of attention. Strong learners also have strong memories; otherwise, weak attention leads to weak memory.</p>
<p>(4) Memory is proportional to the intelligence of the aptitude. Generally speaking, those with clever aptitude have strong memory, while those with dull aptitude often have poor memory.</p>

<h3>Finance: The United Kingdom and the United States Do Not Want to Be Too Hasty; Free Entry and Exit in the Black Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat. The dark market for British and American currencies turned back towards relaxation, due to sales by Banque de l'Indochine and American banks, as Chinese speculators emerged to cover their short positions too eagerly. The market relaxed from the opening in the morning. Bank of England and HSBC offered less supply, and although they re-entered the market later, speculators had already turned to selling. Although the amount of settlements made by importers was huge, Banque de l'Indochine and Chase Bank sold. The US dollar hardened from 5.15625 yuan to 5.25 yuan for settlement. Russia then returned to selling at the indicated price. In the afternoon, there were fewer speculators selling. Later, there were rumors that the Four Banks were withdrawing, and the trend softened as import foreign firms bought to settle. In the end, both exchange rates relaxed. There was a large volume of transactions, and there were very few new purchases and sales by speculators. According to reason and logic, after the foreign exchange freeze, there should be considerable restrictions on transactions. However, in retrospect, the market situation is just the opposite. Is the situation really as reported by the London telecommunications on the 29th? Yesterday's indications here are that the democracies' commercial and financial restrictions on Japan may be implemented leniently. The main purpose of the actions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands was originally to use intimidation against Japan, fearing that being too hasty would force Japan into war and that the property of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East would be the first to suffer. Therefore, they still do not abandon their appeasement policy, resulting in the current strange phenomenon of freezing foreign exchange without settling. Furthermore, there is no date for the promulgation of concrete measures.</p>
<p>Speculators Are Still Trading</p>
<p>From the morning, the foreign books for the British, American, and Indian silver markets were all flat. The exchange rate of each country against Shanghai rebounded by 1.1 yuan for the US dollar (actually, it rebounded by 0.1 yuan; the previous day's telegram was a mistake of 5 yuan instead of 4 yuan). The exchange rate of the pound against Shanghai was slightly 0.15625 yuan. The central government's listed exchange rates were not changed. The internal market opened with banks selling prices, the spot British exchange rate was 3 pence 125, the long was 0.3125, and the US dollar was also long 0.3125, at 5.1875 yuan. Chinese merchants came to buy August US dollars at 5.15625 yuan, reportedly supplied by HSBC. Later, the trend turned hard again. HSBC's listed exchange rates were still changed. The silver balance tax was still levied at 24.25%. It was heard that the HSBC small counter US exchange rate was 5.125 yuan, and people's minds were more stable. Chinese merchants turned to sell at 5.1875 yuan. HSBC and importers all bought in, while Chinese and American banks sold out. Speculators and Chinese banks resold August US dollars to Mai Jiali and others at 5.25 yuan. The loosest price could be settled at the indicated price, but by noon, the US dollar was 5.21875 yuan, and the British pound had hardened to 3 pence 15625.</p>
<p>Importers Continue to Settle</p>
<p>At noon, speculative transactions became sparse, and there was little buying of August at 5.25 yuan. It was heard that importers were still continuously settling. There were rumors of bullish news from Japan, and gold prices rebounded. Therefore, at the evening closing, the situation was quite tight. At 3:30 PM closing, the spot to August British pound was 3 pence 140625, and the US dollar was 5.1875 yuan. Compared with the previous day's closing, the British was long 0.046875, and the US was long 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Spot Rate Relaxes</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 29th (Tuesday) telegram: This morning, HSBC opened flat, the US dollar spot rate relaxed by 125, to 24.75 yuan. The Shanghai dollar spot rate rose by 2.5 yuan, to 477.5 yuan. The rest were unchanged.</p>

<p>Tianjin, 19th (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened soft this morning. The London telegraphic transfer hardened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 4375.

<h3>Gold Market Winds Gradually Subside; Spot Price Retreats Below 8,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market was fluctuating yesterday, but the fluctuations seemed to have turned smaller. However, the market situation is still unstable. Under the shroud of rumors, people's minds turned from fatigue to stability, and after the price gradually fell, it rebounded slightly. It once collapsed, falling below 6,600 yuan. It was rumored that Hong Kong was blockaded, and the tense relations between the US and Japan increased, and the US dollar relaxed to 5.25 yuan. Therefore, both the gold number and securities groups sold heavily, and the price gradually retreated from 6,730 yuan to a low of 6,590 yuan. There was also a certain bullish rumor in this city, and the price rebounded by 50 to 60 yuan before the noon closing. After opening in the afternoon, the market was flat and fatigued. Soon, it was heard that a Japanese merchant ship was released, which might ease the situation. Furthermore, there was a rumor that banks would stop doing foreign exchange today, which aroused the gold and securities groups to re-enter the market, and the price was raised close to 6,700 yuan. However, it was suppressed by a certain money house selling, and the price finally decreased by 27 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 50,000 taels. The swap (July to August) seller posted 70 yuan to the buyer. The cash had reversed and retreated to below 8,000 yuan. In the morning, Shun Yuan offered 20 taels at a price of 8,000 yuan, Tian Yuan offered 50 taels at 8,050 yuan, Wan Feng offered 50 taels at 7,980 yuan, and De Fu offered 20 taels at 7,950 yuan.

Yi Da exited 20 taels from a certain jewelry store at 7,900 yuan, decreasing by 300 yuan. Jewelry gold also decreased by 40 yuan, totaling 810 yuan.</p>

It was heard that the US dollar could be settled at 5.1875 yuan, and Yi Da, Shun Yuan, Xiang Xing, and Yong Li sold, gradually decreasing to 6,680 yuan. Ming Feng, Xin Feng, and the silver number group supplemented, hovering around 6,700 yuan for a long time. Until after 10:30 AM, the foreign exchange continued to relax, people's minds were more vacant, and Yi Da poured out. He Sheng, Cheng Da, Qi Feng, and Ding Sheng started to sell, and the price gradually decreased by 120 yuan, falling to 6,590 yuan. Yi Da re-entered, and Xin Feng Yong also bought. In the bullish rumors, the price rebounded to 6,650 yuan. The noon closing was 6,645 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2:00 PM at 6,640 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower. He Sheng, Shun Yuan, and Yi Li sold, and the price immediately decreased by 30 yuan, shrinking to 6,610 yuan. Soon, in the bullish rumors, Yi Da, Tian Yuan, Tong Kang Yong, He Sheng, and others called up and absorbed, and retail investors re-entered, and the price gradually rose by 85 yuan, reaching 6,695 yuan, and Da Feng and Yi Li sold out. At closing it showed a retreat to 6,660 yuan, Lian Xing and Tong Kang Yong entered another ten yuan or so. The 3:30 PM closing was 6,673 yuan, which was 27 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: If the Southern Route Is Blocked, Shuangma Yarn Will Fall Into Difficulty; A Drop of 200 Yuan in Two Days</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline was still fierce. This was because after the Customs' Japanese Customs Affairs Department announced the regulations prohibiting the export of yarn, cloth, and cotton, the market was greatly shocked, and people were panicked. Because Shuangma yarn only relies on the inland route, general speculators treat it as a standard. If there is a little bit of manipulation, the usual price will be higher than other yarns. Besides the fact that the price of Tiannv yarn is 200 yuan more expensive, once a change breaks out, the reaction is faster and the decline is more drastic. Therefore, if this route is blocked, it will collapse. As for general households holding spot goods, in view of the fact that this yarn is prohibited from being exported, they uniformly sell out in the futures market and the spot Shuangma factory order to protect themselves and temporarily avoid risks. The yarn market was greatly hit. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,545 yuan, and the low price was 1,455 yuan. In the afternoon, people were extremely anxious. At first, it was made at 1,435 yuan to 40 yuan. Gradually, it plummeted to 1,405 yuan. After 3 o'clock, there were rumors of refined bullish news, and at the same time, profit-makers offset it, and the market returned to close at 1,480 yuan. However, the current yarn market, because of the terrible drop of 260 yuan in the past two days, of course, there is a possibility of a rebound.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and the situation was quite vacant. Everyone in the market was shouting to sell, but they were calling for a lower price to enter. The first transaction price was 1,525 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 10 yuan, and buyers flocked in. In a moment, it rebounded to 1,545 yuan. However, the customer business was completely suspended. In the next 30 to 40 yuan, unexpectedly after 11:30, due to a large number of spot merchants selling out, the market price was unable to support it and plummeted. In an instant, it relaxed to 1,455 yuan. Afterwards, profit-makers slightly offset it, and it returned to close at 1,460 yuan. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day totaled 9,020 bales, including 9,000 bales purchased by the same industry and 20 bales taken by the Hong Kong gang.</p>
<p>The morning market situation of Jin Shuangma futures yarn, due to environmental bearishness and rampant rumors, the long positions in August were very smooth to sell, plummeting 60 yuan, the price was 1,405 yuan. It was auctioned to 9's empty households for offsetting, slightly rising by 15 yuan, the price was 1,540 yuan. October also fell by 5 yuan, the price was 1,510 yuan. After opening, new purchases and short covering increased slightly. August was as high as 1,438 yuan, September was flat, and October was 1,523 yuan. After entering, the spot yarn fell, Hong Kong sales stopped, and the selling trend was heavy again. August fell to 1,316 yuan, September was 1,445 yuan, and October was 1,436 yuan. The prices of each month all fell to the extent of the limit down, and the long parties must pay the margin and guarantee money. The 3rd market in August and September was suspended, and the October period rebounded by 19 yuan to close. The noon closing for August and September each fell by 79 yuan, and October fell by 60 yuan. After the market opened at two markets, due to the continuous relaxation of people's minds, the market price was not auctioned. By the time of the third market, it was widely rumored that the Four Banks were withdrawing, and the buying sentiment was revived. The market price opened higher and higher. August rebounded by 22 yuan compared to the noon closing, September by 36 yuan, and October by 30 yuan. The evening closing result was that the August period still fell by 57 yuan compared to the previous day, September fell by 43 yuan, and October fell by 30 yuan. The biggest difference in each month was 95 for September, the total transaction volume for the day was 43,550 bales, an increase of 6,640 bales compared to the previous day, and the daily opening and closing high and low prices were recorded on the left (the net market bid price).</p>
<p>The futures yarn market will be closed today for delivery.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change in the Yarn Market; Cotton Merchants Are Short of Breath</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation, everyone unanimously looked bullish in the past, because foreign cotton stepped up and followed it upwards, unexpectedly the yarn market suddenly changed, the falling wind was already terrible, and the sales were prohibited, the factory will inevitably have the danger of suspending work, so the raw materials are discarded and no one asks. The market price has plummeted because of this. The transaction in yesterday's market was only one transaction by the number family, 100 pieces of Brazilian cotton, the stack delivery price was 503 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>In another message, the Shanghai foreign cotton foreign firms set the price easily. Since the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds and will implement an embargo, the Pacific Ocean suddenly became uneasy. After that, whether American cotton will come to Shanghai or not, and whether Shanghai can continue to trade as usual under the situation that Japan will implement retaliatory freezing, are all major problems that need to be solved at present. At the same time, because the Customs officially announced that the export of yarn and cloth items is not allowed, the current yarn market immediately turned sharply downward and fell into a slump. Because of this, cotton merchants intend to get Lishan, and the market feels tired. In the past two days, the non-special direct purchasers did not dare to try, and no one inquired about the procurement of spot goods.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is unstable and there are differences. At first, it rose due to purchases by the Southern gang and New Orleans, and then it fell due to the international situation being not optimistic and the long parties taking profits. As a result, the closing price was 2-3 points higher or lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Pours Out; East Piece Goods Rise and Fall Suddenly</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market rebounded and fell yesterday, because the embargo on yarn and cloth caused panic, and floating shorts came out and sold. The selling price also gradually decreased. However, in the afternoon, there were rumors of bullish news, and cloth prices rebounded. As a result, white goods still fell by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. There were few transactions in bleached and dyed cloth. The total transaction volume of various cloths in this street was more than 300 pieces, and the Yin Jin gang in the northern road transacted more than 200 pieces of line, wool, and velvet cloths. The South China business is temporarily suspended. Also, today there are 36 pieces of cotton cloth shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>The Dong cloth exchange's futures cloth market first fell and then rebounded. As a result, it fell by 0.3 to 0.8 yuan per piece compared to the previous day's closing price, and the spot market was also manipulated by speculative hoarders, rising and falling suddenly, and the changes were unpredictable. White fine cloth and fine twill generally had no glory or disgrace. The late closing price of the Longtou fine cloth factory order was still 50.09 yuan. The highest price of the four gentlemen's wool fabrics was 1.6425 yuan, the lowest price was 1.57 yuan, and the closing transaction was 1.635 yuan, a decrease of 0.0625 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Grains: There Is Plenty of Rice in Storage, Speculation Does Not Stop, and the Price Is Unstable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the early market for foreign rice had a very strong falling wind, especially for the spot foreign rice small roll. The stock in the market was originally full, and the source had not yet been blocked. Once the exchange rate rises, it can continue to be set. Also, it was heard that the Public Works Bureau had a new transaction agreement for 5,000 tons. In addition, rumors unfavorable to the buyers were very prevalent. Therefore, both retail and wholesale had poured out. It was also heard that if the rice price continued to be manipulated, the warehouses would be sealed. Those who made a profit wanted to get rid of it urgently. Therefore, the opening price of the spot small roll was 1 yuan lower, at 124 yuan. Still 123 yuan down to 120 yuan, a difference of 5 to 6 yuan from the previous day. But before long, there was a saying that it was beneficial to the buyers, and the market gradually rebounded to a high of 123.5 yuan. Once the market price was low, the speculative gangs would absorb it when it was low. In addition, there were various rumors, sometimes bullish, sometimes bearish. The people's food and rice have long been shrouded in a speculative atmosphere. The market price should be up and down, and the speculative ball gangs and manipulators really only fear that the market is too peaceful and the situation is too stable, and they cannot fulfill their wishes. Now, at a time when international events are changing several times a day, they should consider it a unique opportunity to have a good time. In fact, the total amount of rice stored in Shanghai, including the cargo on the way, has reached 3 million dan. Although there is little Du Geng, it can always help. In terms of people's food, there is no need to worry for a year and a half. However, the market finally rebounded by 2 to 34 yuan. As a result, the spot rice still pulled small yuan, while the futures and the current Yinghua Department rose and fell each other. A No. 1 spot Chen package opened to 150 yuan, broken rice was 107.5 to 108.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice was 145 yuan, futures was 142 yuan, small roll futures was 19 yuan, spot rice was 149 yuan starting at 150 yuan, 1512 to 153 yuan. When the spot was initially , No. 1 Saigon once had a cry of 1367 yuan and a small roll of 127 yuan. Then, for the above reasons, it repeatedly returned to small. The floating garden retail households did not die, and they started to buy again. The closing price of No. 1 Saigon was 1312 yuan, No. 2 was 1234 yuan, Min Dang ordinary goods was 128 yuan, 126 yuan, Suci was Nian 2 yuan, Jia Fo rice was Nian 9 yuan, 127 yuan, small roll was 1234 yuan, and Tokyo broken was 111 yuan, broken tip was 96 yuan to 94 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for thick and thin japonica rice, domestic rice, and foreign countries was deserted, but the prices were sufficient, and the foreign rice returned to flat, people's minds turned tired, and the sales market was not good. The opening price was similar to the previous one. The selling price of fresh early and late rice from Nanhang was 154 yuan to 151 yuan, Wuxi Yuan had white japonica rice at 142 yuan to 138 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was 126 yuan to 123 yuan, glutinous tea was 16 yuan to 13 yuan, and Jin 30 domestic glutinous rice was 1278 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Is Tense; The Air Dissipates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot foreign flour market situation re-entered a fatigued state. After the financial upheaval aroused the rising wind, there was suddenly news of a ban on re-export. The tense air suddenly dissipated. With the reduction in actual sales and the release of hoarders, the market turned downstream sharply. The whole market made the opening price of Jinlong flour 33 yuan to 32.9 jiao, and the closing price was only 32.75 jiao. The opening price of Pao Tai flour was 33.9 jiao to 8 jiao, and the closing price was 23.7 jiao. The opening price of Huawu brand Australian flour Taikoo Stack was 33.8 jiao, and the total transaction volume of Shuangying, Wuyan, and other flours was 14,500 bales, a decrease of 7 to 8 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat transaction was still rarely developed. There were about 200 to 300 bales of new wheat from the mainland, all of which were designated for delivery to Japanese factories. The purchase price was still about 41 yuan, and the purchase price of Chinese factories was 47 yuan, but there were no spot goods to be collected. The market was still in a stable state.</p>
<h3>Securities: A Sense of Selling Overwhelms the Stock Market</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday was unusually erratic, fluctuating sharply, with rises and falls measured in dollars and cents. This volatility reflects the uncertainty of the people. Class C bonds rose from 69.20 yuan to 70.05 yuan before retreating slightly to 69.20 yuan, closing at 69.95 yuan. The frequency of these fluctuations and the frenzy of trading ultimately favored the sellers, creating an extremely chaotic market situation. Yesterday, due to short covering, demand exceeded supply. Heng Kang, Run De, Yi Ji, and Gong Mao were all buyers. Lian Yi, Lian He, Yi Tai, and Ren Chang all sold off. Ju Feng and Tong Yu also sold significantly. By the midday close, the market had risen from small gains to larger ones, increasing by almost one yuan compared to the previous day, and exceeding the lowest price by 1.30 yuan. In the afternoon, the primary buyers were Yi Ji, Ren Feng, and Chang Gong Mao. Other firms, such as Xin Fu, entered into Class A and Class E bonds while exiting Class C. Tong Xing and Tong Kang made slight adjustments. However, the surge of sellers was overwhelming, regardless of the consequences. Le Mao alone sold approximately 800,000 yuan worth, and Lian Yi sold 600,000 yuan. Yi Qin, Da Tong, Xinhua Bank, and De Long also released substantial amounts. Furthermore, Jiu Feng, Hong Da, Da Feng, and smaller retail investors selling spot goods were also significant contributors. After the market opened, prices gradually declined, breaking the 70-yuan mark again and revisiting the low of 69.20 yuan. Prices rose and fell sharply, experiencing significant volatility. Were it not for the short covering, the market would have plummeted. Ultimately, the market reversed from gains to losses. Only Class B bonds saw a slight increase of 0.25 yuan due to the substantial drop the previous day, and Class D bonds rose slightly by 0.10 yuan as there were no afternoon transactions. All other bonds retreated by 0.05 to 0.55 yuan, except for Class C bonds, which only fell by 0.05 yuan. Total trading volume for the day exceeded 4.4 million yuan. A concise table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Fifty shares of the Shanghai Cotton Exchange were traded at a price of 52.50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Specializing in Referral Fees</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>"May I ask, where can I find housing?"</p>
<p>Nian Yang points remotely to ×× Village.</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking of heading back for dinner, I suddenly spotted a flyer on a utility pole (at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Medhurst Road). It read: "Housing - Referral Service, - Liu, ×× Village, ×× Number."</p>
<p>"I can't miss this opportunity!" I thought, and headed towards ×× Village.</p>
<p>There were already two women, who looked like wives, requesting referrals. After they left, the person approached me: "About where do you want to be near?" "Near Jing'an Temple," I replied. "Will you introduce me to several good places then?" Without waiting for my answer, he pulled out a fountain pen, tore off a sheet from a notepad, scribbled for a while, handed it to me, and followed with: "Each referral costs 1.20 yuan."</p>
<p>As a result, he gave me four referrals, for which I paid him four yuan.</p>
<p>However, I was again disappointed. The first household wasn't renting, and the second only leased office space.</p>
<p>As I arrived at the third place, my watch pointed to "2," my stomach was growling, and I thought to myself: "The third place is upstairs at ×× Hall in Jing'an Temple; it's better to have a meal before going upstairs to see the house."</p>
<p>While I was eating, a middle-aged woman walked in, and as soon as she entered, she asked: "Is there any housing available for rent here?" Immediately, a voice came from the counter: "What kind of use are you putting it to?" "Residential," she said. "Residential is not for rent."</p>
<p>"Residential is not for rent?" In unison, the middle-aged woman and I felt as though we had had a bucket of cold water dumped on our heads.</p>
<p>After a moment, a young man in a suit came in: "Excuse me, where can I inquire about renting a place?" "What kind of use are you putting it to?" "For office space," he said. "Not for rent, we only rent to residential."</p>
<p>This made me curious; what was going on?</p>
<p>After finishing my meal, I asked the waiter: "Is there any housing for rent upstairs?" Before the waiter could answer, the voice from the counter chimed in: "What kind of use are you putting it to?" From the initial conversation between the two people looking for housing, I gained experience, so I countered: "What are you planning to rent it out for?" He scrutinized me with sharp eyes. I was dressed politely and carrying a briefcase. (Inside were newspapers and the rental slips the tea room had given me.) He slyly said: "We only rent to residential, nothing else." "Then please accompany me upstairs to take a look," I said.</p>
<p>He seemed a bit disappointed, because he assumed I was looking to rent office space. But he had no choice, so he accepted the referral slip and accompanied me upstairs.</p>
<p>The room was as small as it could be, with a window facing the street. Because the restaurant kitchen was downstairs, the room was full of smoke, and even the ceiling was black. In one corner were four or five bedding rolls, said to be for the old steward to sleep on. He told me the monthly rent was 250 yuan.</p>
<p>Although I knew their game, I figured the money was already in their hands, so what was there to say? Therefore, I had to leave all the way down – directly down the stairs, running through the partition walls.</p>
<p>Alas! Their income is quite good! If thirty people are fooled by one house in a day, then the referral fees alone would be a thousand yuan a month. Moreover, they can still have someone sleep there at night. There is nothing strange in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Embarrassing Situations</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiale</p>
<p>Street Doctor: Brothers, I've recently invented a type of medicine. Apply it to a rotten foot, and it will heal immediately. Everyone, buy a bottle and try it out. Guaranteed to be effective.</p>
<p>Passerby: If this medicine is so effective, why is there such a big hole in your foot?</p>
<p>Dancer: Here's ten yuan for you to buy some candy.</p>
<p>Dance Girl: Mr. ××, you've mistaken, this is a pawn ticket!</p>
<p>A: A friend passed away, and I'm preparing to give × yuan. What should I write on the envelope?</p>
<p>B: You should write "Condolence Money." Here! I'll write it for you!</p>
<p>C: Brother! You've written it wrong; you've written "Respectful Appearance."</p>
<p>Zhang San: How have you been recently?</p>
<p>Li Si: Not bad! My monthly income, after all expenses, still leaves me with a net surplus of one or two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Landlord: (Rushing in, agitated) Mr. Li! You owe three months' rent; how come you never mention it?</p>
<h3>Oscillating Fan</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhu</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed clever person said: "It's most difficult to be a 'modern' person. To be able to navigate the 'left' and also please the 'right' is truly a difficult thing. However, based on my 'experience,' it's best to imitate an oscillating fan, pleasing both the east and 'delighting' the west, achieving 'universal happiness,' so to speak."</p>

<p>"Mei Bao, you can expect to eat this bowl of rice!" He put down his erhu, trying his best to suppress the joy in his heart, and said very solemnly, "However, if we singers want to earn big money, a small part depends on talent, but a large part depends on diligent study. If you really want to learn from me, you must practice for at least two years, and only then can you ask for 18,000 from others."</p>
<p>Two years. Although Mei Bao felt it was too long, the words "18,000" had entered her bloodstream like an anesthetic, causing her to nod her head repeatedly without realizing it.</p>
<p>She thought about how hard her father had worked in recent years, not eating enough, not dressing warmly. When had she seen him smile? These past few months of illness, the money for the doctor, the money for medicine, and the money to hire two workers to help Xiao Gouzi in the fields, all of it came out of the old leather trunk under her bed. Every time Mei Bao took out a banknote, she clearly saw the muscles on her father's face twitching. Without asking, she knew how painful it was for him! Later, during the days when his illness was severe and he was unconscious, he kept mumbling, "One thousand gone," "Five hundred gone," "Less than three hundred left"… This series of painful delirium.</p>
<p>"Even if I only earn 1,800 a month after learning to act in two years, that will still be hundreds of times more comfortable than now!" She lowered her head, fiddling with the corner of her clothes as she thought this.</p>
<p>"But there's one thing I must tell you first:" Shang Lao Er constantly rubbed his ten fingers, which were yellowed by opium smoke, and said with a very gentle smile on his face. "The rules of learning opera are a bit different from those in your school. When you are learning, I don't want any money from you, but after you have learned the opera and go on stage, this old man's remaining years will depend entirely on you! Child, think about whether you are willing or not?" (171)</p>
<h3>Husband's Assets</h3>

<p>In divorce cases, it is usually the woman who initiates them, while men rarely do. Firstly, because they would need to pay a large amount of alimony; if they don't love their wives, they can seek pleasure outside without divorcing. Secondly, because husbands can treat their wives as private property; if one isn't right, they can acquire another one, the more the better. If you don't believe it, please see the table above. However, this example only refers to the leisure class; bachelors are excluded.</p>
<h3>A Review of School Life Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ye Xingnian</p>
<p>In the unique environment of Shanghai, schools, which are merely filling vacancies for profit, are crammed onto the isolated island, hanging up the banner of sanctity, while actually engaging in transactions. Many students do not cherish their rare opportunities for education and valuable youth, nor do they think about the earnest expectations that the nation and society place on them.</p>
<p>A year ago, I blindly entered such a school and began to see the darkness inside. In the classrooms, filled with everything, there were sounds of debauchery, shamelessness, laughter, and scolding. There was not a moment of quiet. Even when the teacher was shouting loudly to explain, they had the power to turn a deaf ear. Therefore, the relationship between teachers and students gradually became like ice and charcoal, impossible to melt. The most unbearable thing was that this was performed every day.</p>
<p>The students were too indulgent, too free, arbitrarily changing seats during class, endlessly talking loudly, and constantly humming Peking opera tunes. As a result, teachers resorted to beating and scolding as the only good method of instruction. In the past, corporal punishment was the exclusive right of teachers, but now, in this method of instruction, pushed to the extreme of emotion, it was simply a dance of fists and feet, with yelling filling the room.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to discuss whether this kind of beating and scolding conforms to the principles of education. In the end, everyone goes their own way. No improvement has been seen, and the opposition between teachers and students has left even deeper cracks.</p>
<p>Schools are supposed to be havens of education, and "patient and skillful guidance" is also an established method of education. "Not convinced by heart" is also a warning from the sages. Teachers and students should have their own feelings, so why should they face each other with weapons like labor and management? The world is going downhill, and it's hard to stop sighing.</p>
<p>We should know that the foundation of nation-building is in schools. Those that aim for money and value form over substance, and cannot make education conform to the times, will not exist in the current great era. These young people who lack the spirit of self-study and self-governance need reasonable supervision and guidance. We must seek close connections in sincere communication, becoming one. In that case, what is there to fear in a solid union, which cannot produce an invincible, great power! (Moved to help those in need)</p>
<h3>Loss of Blood</h3>
<p>— Wu Qing</p>
<p>Shanghai's bedbugs are truly ubiquitous, with traces of them in tall foreign houses and attics. It's just a matter of how many! Let's take my home as an example to calculate our blood loss:</p>
<p>Each of us probably supports fifty bedbugs of all sizes, each consuming half a cc per night. Shanghai has a population of five million, and if more than half of them are infested, then the consumption every night is 1.25 million cc of precious blood. What an alarming number! I don't know how many wounded soldiers and patients could be saved with that blood!</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Huilu</p>
<p>Bao Sen and Hui Zhu Collaborate on Visiting Mother</p>
<p>Yang Bao Sen was originally a second-tier veteran singer who came south several times with Zhang Eyun, Song Dezhu, and others. He was very popular with opera enthusiasts who considered him a rare talent among veteran singers. After returning north, he was encouraged by friends to form his own troupe, collaborating with Xu Xiu Sha and others. Recently, Bao Sen performed "Si Lang Visits His Mother" at the Sanqing Theater. The collaborator was Yan Jupeng's daughter, Yan Hui Zhu. The two were billed together, and the advertisements on the theater posters were very bizarre. Under Yang's name was written "Visiting Mother and Returning the Order," while under Yan's name was written "Princess Iron Mirror." This was probably a special condition for Yang and Yan's collaboration. Recently, I heard that Bao Sen will meet Shanghai audiences at the Golden Theater in the guise of a top-billed performer. If this comes to pass, it may cause quite a stir.</p>
<p>Shao Shan and Ju Peng Collaborate on Entering the Palace</p>
<p>"Entering the Palace Twice" is a labor-intensive opera requiring the collaboration of veteran, dan (female), and jing (painted-face) performers. The entire opera is sung non-stop from beginning to end. If any of the three performers is weak, it will be greatly diminished. Therefore, this excellent opera used to be listed as a cold, unpopular piece. A few years ago, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, Wang Quankui, and others staged this opera at the Golden Theater, and it became a hit. "Entering the Palace Twice" was transformed from a cold piece into a popular one. People like Yan Jupeng and Zheng Bingru also used this opera to promote their performances in Shanghai. However, due to imperfect matching, the performances have not been completely satisfactory. The role of Xu Yanzhao has been particularly difficult to cast. Recently, I heard that there will be a special performance with the cast of Jin Shao Shan as Xu Yanzhao, Yan Jupeng as Yang Bo, and Nan Tiesheng as Li Yanfei. Shao Shan's "Entering the Palace Twice" has been recorded, and his powerful voice is indeed the most ideal for playing Xu Yanzhao. Yan Jupeng is known for his singing skills, and his "Entering the Palace Twice" includes unique verses such as "Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter." Except for his slightly narrow voice and occasional strange tones, he can also be said to be the typical actor for playing Yang Bo. As for Nan Tiesheng, he previously gave a short performance at the Golden Theater, and his singing was beautiful, earning the praise of connoisseurs. With the collaboration of these three, the excellence of the performance is naturally expected. It's a pity that this good opera cannot be brought to Shanghai to perform; otherwise, it would definitely be a sensation. In addition to this public performance of the main opera, there will be a cross-dressed comic piece, "Double Yao Hui." The cast list is very funny: Jin Shao Shan plays the First Wife, Yan Jupeng and Xiao Changhua play the two Neighbors, Hou Xirui plays the Second Wife, and Nan Tiesheng plays the Husband.</p>
<h3>Guo Chunyang's First Performance</h3>
<p>— Luyuan Scholar</p>
<p>Guo Chunyang's public performance was originally scheduled for the Carlton, but due to supporting roles, it was changed to the Golden Theater. This is the time for a hero to put his skills to use and a good man to show his skills. However, Chunyang has never performed in Shanghai before (except for a performance of "Dingjun Mountain" during his teacher's sixtieth birthday celebration, which was an exception). Opera enthusiasts do not know his skills. Now, I will briefly introduce two or three of the features of the various operas he has performed that are unique to him or cannot be performed by other actors, so that people can see the whole picture.</p>
<p>(1) "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box": This is a purely Tan-style masterpiece. Chunyang was able to perform this opera at the age of ten. After more than ten years of training, it has become even more refined. This opera is divided into four acts: "Questioning the Woodcutter," "Making a Scene at the Mansion," "Beating the Stick," and "Leaving the Box." The singing, recitation, and acting are all extremely demanding. His dialogue with the woodcutter and his body language in the recitation are unique. The singing in "Making a Scene at the Mansion," the expressions in "Beating the Stick," and the "Iron Bridge" in "Leaving the Box," as well as the hair-flipping when seeing the constables, cannot be done by someone who has not worked hard and has deep roots.</p>
<p>(2) "The Banquet of the Ministers": This opera is known to the world for its singing, recitation, and acting, and the drumming is the most difficult part of this opera. But the most difficult part is not the "Late at Night" section, but the three drum rolls. The dots, wrists, and skills must be evenly matched, and the weights, speeds, highs, and lows must be well-organized without any bias or heaviness. The generosity, intensity, tragedy, and desolation directly move the listeners and amaze the audience. Drumming skills like this are enough to overwhelm everything. If you don't believe me, please verify it another day.</p>
<p>(3) "Celebrating the Pearl": This opera was performed by Mei Lanfang in the United States and was very popular with people there. It is a social drama with a very good plot and profound meaning. According to Chinese old principles: what is called the inequality of wealth and the bullying of good people by evil gentry, according to today's world trend: is what is called class struggle, the disparity between labor and capital, one squeezing and the other resisting. The Americans watched this opera and criticized and praised this opera with this perspective. Chunyang's performance is in line with this purpose. The excellence of the singing and acting goes without saying. He has a special skill in the fight scene with the teacher, the "flying kick", which is unmatched by other actors. In addition, there are popular plays such as "Dingjun Mountain," "Empty City Stratagem," "Catching and Releasing," "Visiting the Mother," "Battle of Taiping," and "Fa Men Temple," all of which have unique features and are his proud works. They are must-see plays, so I will not list them all. Please wait and see.</p>
<h3>Jade Blossoms in a Rain of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow One's Head in the Wilderness</p>
<p>Xu Jing thought to himself, "This beast has openly come to harass people. Either way, it's just a wolf, and no matter how fierce it is, I think I can handle it with this sword in my hand. But if this beast damages my mount, that would be a great pity." So he mustered his courage, opened the door, and rushed out with his sword. The wolf saw someone walking out of the door, as if it had found its target, opened its greedy mouth, and raised its sharp claws, pouncing towards Xu Jing's head. Xu Jing shouted, "Beast, stop your rampage, take my sword!" and thrust the Crimson Phoenix Sword into the wolf's belly. The wolf saw the sword light and quickly turned its body away, and then pounced again, pouncing at his feet. Xu Jing swept the sword downwards, and the sword's edge struck the wolf's paw. Although the wolf was injured, its courage did not diminish, and it bit at Xu Jing. Xu Jing wielded the sword quickly, and wrestled with the giant wolf. Man and wolf lunged and attacked each other for more than a dozen rounds. Xu Jing watched for an opening and used the Rhinoceros Dividing Water stance, thrusting the sword in, and it pierced into the giant wolf's abdomen. The wolf cried miserably and fell to the ground. Xu Jing drew out his sword and added another strike to the wolf's head. The wolf died stiffly in a pool of blood. Xu Jing took a breath, dragged the wolf up, threaded it with rope, and tied it to a large tree, waiting for Liu Yining to return, so that he could report his merits to him. Just after he tied it, he suddenly heard a howl from the opposite cliff. He looked up and saw two wolves running towards him. Xu Jing thought to himself, "I and the dead wolf fought to the point of being somewhat exhausted, and now there are these two wolves coming. If I am careless, my life would be worth less than nothing. But if I were to close the door, and Liu Yining returned home and saw it, wouldn't he laugh at me for being timid and useless?" So he picked up many small stones from the ground, hid them in his bag, and climbed up a large tree in front of the door. Just as he settled down, the two wolves had already rushed to the foot of the tree. They saw the dead wolf and looked at Xu Jing in the tree. They also knew that their companion had been killed by this person, so they all shouted and jumped at Xu Jing, vowing to get him. (128)</p>
<h3>A Record of an Airborne Musical Performance</h3>
<p>— Leidianhua</p>
<p>The Shanghai music scene, which had been dormant for a long time this year, has become active on the isolated island filled with lifelessness. The Chinese Vocational School Harmonica Team, the Guoguang Harmonica Team, the Public Harmonica Society, the Shanghai United Harmonica Team, the Postal Workers' Union Harmonica Team, the Municipal Council Harmonica Team, the Chinese Amateur Music Society, the Shanghai Sacred Music Troupe, the Yafeng Chinese Orchestra... more than ten musical organizations jointly held a public celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the "China New Musical Instrument Changji Manufacturing Company" at Xinhua Radio Station the day before yesterday (27th) in an "Airborne Music Conference."</p>
<p>That afternoon, various vehicles sped to the central Hongmiao on Nanjing Road. There were obviously more people getting out of the cars than usual. Among those "happy" men and women, most of them were there to participate in this meaningful "Airborne Music Concert" and to admire the true faces of the musicians.</p>
<p>The broadcasting studio was filled with chairs, neatly arranged in rows, with different seats indicating the different parts played by the performers, so that they could cooperate and stick to their posts. All programs, including the Guoguang Team, Postal Workers' Team, United Team harmonica ensemble, the Public Team accordion ensemble, the Yafeng Society Chinese Orchestra ensemble, and the Pipa solo, were the most popular and praised.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>(1) The Yihai Theater Troupe, composed of some amateur young people who love drama in this city, is actively rehearsing famous dramas and preparing for public performances. It is said that the income from this performance of the troupe will be donated to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, and it is expected that there will be considerable results at that time. In addition, the troupe recently plans to solicit members who love drama and are fluent in Mandarin to jointly study drama and practice performances. Those who want to request the charter and register can send a letter to Mr. Sun or Mr. Xiang at No. 100, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, this city. (2) Mr. Gu Mingdao's social romance novel "Cherishing Parting" is now published by Chunming Bookstore. The entire book is three thick volumes, with a real price of four yuan and fifty cents in national currency. The book is also being filmed into a movie by Guohua Film Company. Those who love reading Mr. Gu's novels must be eager to see it first. Sales outlet: Mingdao Publishing House, No. 6, Lane 347, Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Pear Garden Figures</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(Twenty-Six) Chen Shaolin</p>
<p>Chen Shaolin is the son of Qingyi (female role) master Chen Delin. He attended school as a child and never devoted himself to learning opera. It was not until Chen Delin passed away and for the sake of the family that he began to devote himself to it. Shaolin's sister married Yu Shuyan, and because of this relationship, she taught him very forcefully, stricter than a professional teacher. Even for a slight mistake, she would whip him without mercy, not even sparing him when important guests were present. Because of this, Shaolin was always afraid when he saw Yu Shuyan, trembling lest he not meet his expectations. With such reservations, his comprehension gradually disappeared. The fact that Shaolin received Yu Shuyan's earnest guidance but could not grasp all of Yu Shuyan's beauty was due to Yu Shuyan's poor teaching, and it was not entirely because the student was not diligent. However, Shaolin has already gained much. In recent times, among the rising veteran singers, although there seem to be many, in terms of strictly adhering to the rules and not daring to act arbitrarily outside the established guidelines, after Yu Shuyan, there is only one Yang Baosen, and after Baosen, only Shaolin. This is what I can say with certainty and without doubt. It is a pity that his voice is slightly hoarse and his talent is not the best. In the future, if he works hard and deepens his skills, he may be able to make up for this shortcoming through artificial means.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) From the twenty-fifth article of this magazine, Mr. Zheng Guoyi has been hired to write the articles. Mr. Zheng Guoyi has a wealth of knowledge of drama and explains the history of the opera world as if recounting family treasures. Use a few words to introduce him.</p>
