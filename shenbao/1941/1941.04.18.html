<p>本月十三日，蘇日兩國公表在莫斯科簽訂的中立條的全文。舉世囂然，從種種方面加以批評論斷，蔚爲近日各國報紙的最大量資料；我們不遑逐一爲之檢討，但所予我們印象則頗異其趨；蘇聯報紙最妙，對此持論，不落尋常窠臼，蓋並不歌頌之爲兩國親善，禱祝之爲東亞和平，却直指爲這是日本認識了蘇聯的結果，眞是，在這時勢，蘇聯確是有其若此自傲的資格，惟在來使尙未踱出國門，便發這樣議論，這在旁觀者覺得言者太天眞了，而聞者殆不免於熱刺。美國國務卿赫爾氏最冷雋，以爲世人重視之過度。本報却幸前論未謬，以爲蘇聯不因此而停止援華，日本不以此爲立即南進的因素；這兩點，是五天以來的世界輿情之憂憤所集，經過了五天，漸决澄淸了；至少如昨日電訉所傳蘇聯當局已向中國蔣委員長保證援華政策的絕不變更，更有澄淸的絕對的功效。</p>
<p>至於已本南進問題，我們以爲廣義的南進，如政冶的經濟的，在法越，在泰國，早已發動；至於軍事的發動南進，是狹義的，日本至少在目前無此氣魄，無此力量，而有待於歐洲戰局顯見了德勝英敗之際。蘇聯與日本訂立了中立條的，確使日本在法理上解除北顧之憂；這在法理的不折不扣爲任何人所必予承認，法理以外又必爲任何人所欲全部保留。况制定國策的機樞以及運用國策的基調，既超越乎法理範疇、而日本久已乎梭巡而不敢遽邇南進者，復不盡因北顧多憂，則僅此法理的北顧無憂，何足以論斷日本因此而便南進。日本近數年的國際孤立，嘗因去秋的簽訂德日義三國盟的而門面爲之一變；若問日本究竟得何實益，則爲日人所啞然。此决與蘇聯訂的，以解決所謂中國事變以及準備所謂南進爲其憧憬的前途，似亦門面之光輝；若問此的究竟何裨於所憧憬，則又必爲日人所啞然。髹漆了門面，孤立還是孤立。至於三國盟的後的英美在遠東採行緊密的平行政策，蘇日締的後的美國聲明切實援華，蘇聯聲明繼續援華，這是門面髹漆後之無情的創痕。</p>
<p>當然，自從南進猶有北顧之憂，進而爲南進在法理上北顧無憂，總是進步，總是開展，未許以其僅僅聊勝於無而視爲等於零。且以日本爲並無南進的氣魄與力量，亦祗指目前而非論定終身；估量日本，或估量任何對方，允未許太低，吾則便蹈了義國對希臘，日本對中國的覆轍。更以所謂『顯見德勝英敗之際』而言，縱使我們信任英國必獲最後勝利，然在確定最後勝利之前，還有許多片段，許多機會，得以視爲」德勝英敗一了；義大利去年選擇參戰時機，所選即是既往若干片段與機會之一，此其敎訓，夠痛切，此其例證，夠明瞭。日本懷抱最大野心的急淮派，大的與墨索里尼祇有程度之差。因此之故，何謂德勝英敗，日人自有抉擇的權衡，殆不同於我們。我們却同情於昨日所傳之一說：德日兩國成立密的，在德國軍力進展至蘇彝士運河之時，即日本對英國開始軍事行動之日。此說確吾，即德日間有無密的，及密的是吾如此內容，目前絕無證明之方法，但審察事理與情形，却有可信。若謂日本根本並無袒德參戰的誠意，或謂日本估量德軍無法打到蘇彝士運河，爰以所傳密的的內容，與德國虛相委蛇；如此云云，入木三分，我們確是沒有可予反對的理由。不然，我們再不能覓致日本參戰的更好時機與條件了。德軍抵達蘇彝士河畔，便是德勝英敗的又一片段；日本對英開始軍事行動，便是所謂南進的主要體態。</p>
<p>我們何以同情此說？日本乃至任何好戰國家，無不以較小犧牲換取較大收穫爲極則；完整的英國，非日本所欲孤注一擲，與相抗衡；待至英國竟被割裂爲數橛，則正是日本所認爲「落水狗」，而非打不得分嘗一臠。英國以海軍立國，其艦隊雖行駛不常，聚散靡定，然最粗的分剖，不外三區：直布羅陀海峽以西，及至整個大西洋，是其一；自直布羅陀以迄蘇彝士運河，包括整個地中海，是其二；蘇彝士運河迤西而印度洋，乃至於遠東，是其三。摧毀英國海上覇權，其事甚難，非希特勒不作是想：及至割裂了，則蘇彝土河以東的海上力量，日本比較優勢；要動手，是時機！而德義聯軍在北非洲作戰，近來勝了數仗，進侵埃及，眞是面對了蘇彝士運河進展着，進展着，英國至此，並不悲觀。日本對德倘若有如所傳密的，則正在患得患失，畏首畏尾的情緒之下，開始戰慄吧！何以戰慄，以海軍爲孤注，正是危道，對付割裂後的英國雖曰優勢，其如美國何？</p>

<h3 id="c50">美國海軍大觀 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>砲聲隆隆震天　這里便是所謂最後關頭，其餘一切祗是些預備的工作而已。除了大砲「開口」之外，一概「免談」，所謂口者便是那些戰鬥艦上所裝十四吋和十六，吋的大砲。在作戰之中，「伊達華」號上每塔三尊砲的四個砲塔同時向敵人轟擊，十二巨響之中，所隔歇的時閒極爲短暫。十二發赤黃色的火團，在碧油色的海面上滑溜而過。大砲發射之時，全船好像突受衝擊，大爲震動。當那重一百二十噸的大砲向後倒縮六尺之時，全船便會因受震而橫裹側向水面。相隔的一分鐘之後，那兩噸重的火藥和鋼鐵，便在十五英里之外，擊中敵艦了。</p>
<p>在戰術上，總指揮已盡其所能而竭力做去了。現在只靠他的砲手，在自己米被敵人擊沉之前，把敵艦轟沉。在船上高高地位的瞭望塔中，指揮方位的船員們，牢牢「釘住」着敵艦，不時轉動那方位輪舵，使無毫髮之差。在船腹深藏隱閉之部，一閒燈火通明小小的作戰參謀室中，軍官們正在悉心計算砲火的射陣，方位，速度，和目標角度等等。總指揮站立在橋樓上，咬緊了牙齒，凝神一志地察看着自己方面的艦舶，有沒有遭受損傷，再留心敵人方面的損折程度，以備一舉而殲滅之。</p>
<p>瞭望塔及作戰參謀室中所算出來的一切數字結果，均由電機傳達至四個砲塔中的針盤上面。裏面的人便照着指示的度數，轉動砲塔，並舉起砲身，至毫厘無誤的位置。這一瞬之問，船身保持着水平，針對着敵艦，指揮塔中的人員，把機鈕一撳，所有的大砲便同時齊發。可是像這樣的安靜而科學化的動作，如果碰到敵艦的砲火準確地打中了自己的艦身上，那沒霎時之閒，全船便會發生不可名狀的凌亂狀態了。</p>
<p>像這樣偉大的二重工作，其時間至多不過半小時。最後，美國艦隊衝破了敵陣的先頭，先把第一艘擊沉，繼之以中央的幾艘軍艦。其餘的許多敵艦，逃的逃了，中彈的巳莫能行動，下了旗乞降。這塲海戰至此便吿終了。</p>
<p>海面上收拾殘餘　大砲的怒吼聲沉寂之後，海面上便顯現出了一派和平的景像。敵方的殘餘軍艦在水平綫外漸漸隱去，無疑地，他們是受了創傷，在那里掙扎而已。美國海軍艦隊雖則獲勝，也頗有損傷。戰艦縱還浮在水面上，沒有沉沒，可是有幾條船受傷的程度亦很利害。十來隻巡洋隊，和二十艘左右的驅逐艦，不是打沉，便已無用。殘骸破壳在水面上倒處漂浮着。</p>
<p>不多一會，沒有受損的幾條驅逐艦疾駛而來，從許多小艇和已在沉沒中的船舶上，把溺在水中間的，及受傷的官兵一一救援起來，分別轉運到重巡洋艦，戰鬥艦，和航空母艦上去。那裏的醫士和牧師們已在手術室中，等待着爲他們治療創傷。傷勢十分沉重者，則送往停留在海軍根據地的病院船上，施以治療。就是敵方的重傷俘虜，也給以同樣的急救。</p>
<p>像上面所述的一個海戰，立刻要計算出雙方損折的船隻和人員，在事實上非常困難。近世史上大規模的海戰屈指可數。每次作戰，雙方所擊損的軍艦，和戰死的官兵，爲數亦頗可觀。上屆大戰時，查德蘭一役，英國損失戰艦三艘，巡洋艦三艘，及驅逐艦八艘。德國方面爲戰鬥艦一艘，戰鬥巡洋艦一艘，輕巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦五艘。雙方官兵喪命者共八千六百四十二人。然而時至今日，歷史家稱這一塲海戰　「非決戰」。</p>
<p>即在演習戰中，水兵們也眞有受傷的。有些人在砲塔中受灼傷，有些航空駕駛員在巨浪滔天的水面降落，因而受傷。軍艦的木身有時亦有損壞可能。當大艦轟擊之頃，震蕩十分厲害，電燈泡爲之爆裂，甚至堅厚的水管也會炸開來，船上專鬥有兵士職司修理。</p>

<p>我人已知化學之重要及硏究之必要、但每因其難或望而却步、或中途停止、致爲山　仭、功虧一簣、今筆者本其硏究化學之心得及教授化學之經騐、略舉硏究之方法當余上課時常問學生對於何種功課最有興趣、輒曰、「化學」、問其對於何種功課最感困難、亦日、「化學」、究其故、則曰讀化學如看戲法、故甚爲有趣、但千頭萬緒變化無窮、難以記憶、故最感困難、讀化學猶如看戲法、其基本觀念、業已錯誤、讀之安得不難、要知看戲法「眼睛」一刹母鷄變鴨、此係假者、欲明瞭、欲學會不過手術嫻熟而已、讀化學知白糖與氯酸鉀相混加以濃硫酸則發火、此係眞者欲明瞭其眞實原理之何在、並非易事、因化學對於自然現象之解釋與科學理論之叙述、均有事實之根據及嚴密之組織、決非學變戲法者可比擬也、故硏究化學者、須有先決之條件、條件爲何、請細視之、</p>
<p>（一）濃厚之興趣　無論做事或讀書、欲得滿意之效果、首先對於此事發生興趣而後可、研究化學亦不能例外、如何方能引起研究化學之興趣耶、</p>

<p>B多觀察　吾人應認識化學之硏究、必須與吾人實際生活發生密切之關係、處處應將日常生活所接觸之事物爲起點、多作深刻之觀察如行路時兩傍時有所見之炸油矰、實有化學之因素存在、烘燒餅亦有化學之作用在內、他若漆器與粉刷皆有化學之原理在內、總之處處能留意觀察、加以研討、對於化學之研究、自會發生濃厚之興趣、</p>

<p>— 殷古</p>
<p>什麽叫做故事，或許是已故的事，喚它爲故事；不過是吾會重復發生成爲「新事」呢？那我可難以斷定。且先　下面一個外國故事：</p>
<p>一七八八年夏季，法國全國陷入飢饉中，穀物的價格，逐日騰貴，農民及城市貧民都不能得食。飢餓的「羣衆」起而「搶掠」穀類會庫及麵　店，「攻擊投機商人」。巴黎的工人及苫力發生暴動，「搗毀工廠及廠主的住宅」，全城到處騷動，民衆都起了反抗心。……</p>
<p>這是一个故事，離開現在已經一百五十多年了，孤島的「投機商人」可免擔憂，「工廠」及「廠主住宅」也不會被波及而搗毀，而且，而且那是「天方夜譚」，儘可放心！</p>
<p>但，一九四一夏季在即，那是吾成爲「那個」　方巴黎新事，照目前市况看來，那連講故事的人也難以斷定了………</p>

<p>— 將伯</p>
<p>看了「浮生若夢」回來</p>
<p>「浮生若夢」據說是一個有名的戲劇，在美國的影壇上，會有過個極高的評價，現在這戲是給翻譯成中文過來了，一般說來，牠的確不失爲一個輕鬆活潑有趣味的劇本。</p>
<p>這劇中問，描述了二個不同的家庭：一个是充溢了天倫的樂趣的家，每一個家的分子，都有着他們不同的嗜好，－不是愛好，而放任地，－不，應是自在地努力於牠，醫如有喜歡寫作的，有喜歡製作化學爆仗之類的，有喜歡硏究京劇的，更有喜歡集郵的等等，總之，任着自由的意志，在這家庭中絕對沒有束縛壓迫等的情形，只充溢了愉快的工作，和春一般暖和淸朗的氣息。</p>
<p>但被描述中的另一個家的情形，却不同了，一家所終日思慮進行着的便只是賺錢的工作，因此家裏整個地顯現了拘束，沈悶暮氣的死寂，但這在年靑的一代是不甘長此屈服的，感受了前一个家庭的宣化，在二個不同的家庭環境下的年靑的一代，－但有着共同的意志的，終於美滿地得以衝破阻碍而結合，同時連老的頑固的一代，也翻然改從了生活的目標，爲了「名」和「利」，一生碌碌，畢竟是如「夢」一般的空慮！這裏主要地吿訴你，你所追求中的「榮華富貴」，却都是過目烟雲而已，即使給你達到了目的。但能享受生活的自足中的悠然超然的樂趣，那才是眞正生的快樂。</p>
<p>我們展眼此時此地的一切，宛如浩海中的泥蜉，孽孽衆生，大多是沒有不爲生活，「名」和「利」在奔碌和竄動中，甚至造成這一個時期的市塲上的動亂，平民叢間的飢僅，所謂「榮華富貴」者是多麽地被今天一般人們所熱愛地追求着，他似可以拋棄一切的决要（被認作决要的）需水，但不可一日放棄了「榮華富貴」的追求，那麼的這决「浮生若夢」的演出，是具有了牠的警惕的現實性的，讓「富貴榮華」的迷戀者們覺醒一下，「浮生沿夢」，何必若此？</p>
<p>不過在我認爲遺憾的，是這個戲所顯示給我們的不解積極性！因爲據我所看到的，和所感覺到的，除了視「富貴榮華」如過目烟雲之外，就以求得家庭間的，生活上的，舒適的自由的樂趣爲滿足了；事實上這種平和的樂趣的獲得，顯然是現得太自私，太卑微了。我想祗少當我們生活的社會，正擂動着空前的局面的今天，讓享受樂趣，追求安逸自樂的心理，普遍到一般的頭腦裏去，是非常不適宜的，而且是非常不應該有的！</p>
<p>連續在本報上刊登着的「奮鬥的人生觀」中有一段說：「……所以人之爲人，完全依靠社會，爲社會而奮鬥，是尊重大我，也是人類不可推諉的犬職！」這裏已透徹地說明了此時此地我們所需要建立起的生活觀念是怎樣的！</p>
<p>我們需要建立起「大我」的人生觀來！</p>

<p>— 孝亞</p>
<p>本月九日晨，杭州灣金山嘴發生覆舟慘事，旅客二百餘人，生還者僅四十餘人，如此慘劇之禍因，自然是船主等貧財玩忽生命，然乘客缺少冷靜之頭腦來應輔事變，缺乏團結的力量共挽危局，亦是造成這决慘案原因之一。</p>
<p>據報載：當時船抵金山嘴海面，因風急潮湧，船身載量又重，船主知危險急迫，將船向金山嘴泥灘衝上，但已無法挽救，船身碎裂。在未碎之前，船主爲保全其船，大聲疾呼飭旅客登灘，亦是應該之事；不過在登岸之時，此二百餘人，若能團結一下，設法離船，生命一定不致喪失如此之多。離船時，第一先要安靜，不可爭先恐後；立足灘上後。應各人手和手連接握住，成功一人鏈，孩童應由壯年人背伏，這樣一定不易被浪衝倒，即有衝倒，也容易救起，不致有生命之憂。而四十餘人走錯方向，落海喪生者亦可避免。等立定之後，再視潮之漲落，若潮漲應設法急急登陸；若係落潮，不妨大家站定不動，待潮回小再走，或緩緩前進，即使到天明冉走也不妨。現在你走柬，我走西，各人分頭逃生，結果還是逃不了死。</p>
<p>現在是多難時候，這决覆舟慘事，是給我們教訓。</p>
<h3 id="c96">「貧」與「富」的矛盾 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>「搶」與「囤」的基本因素</p>
<p>「人爲財死，烏爲食亡。」</p>
<p>這是自古以來的「做人之道」，而多少人，也就在這「偉大」的「目標」底下「奮鬭」一生，結果是腰纏萬千金，而成了面團團的，富翁。假如，一旦自己雙目一閉，四「盡孝」於子孫，所謂「孝」「子」之名，大概其來由也就在此。吾則，做父母的如果不辛苦些爭點遺產下來，似乎是對不起子女的，這一想頭在我們祖先中，不，連生長在二十世紀，叫十一年代的今天，尙且還有很多人抱有這種「偉大」的「計劃」和「想頭」。這眞叫不愧爲父母之「模範者」。</p>
<p>這是死要錢的一種人。</p>
<p>還有一種是「得過且過」的，只要有錢是什麼都「幹」的。他們是不管什麼卑鄙與廉恥的，只有金錢才是萬能的東西。但這種人倒不是一定要留下什麽遺產，祇求一己的安富尊榮和享樂而巳。</p>
<p>這是死要錢的又一種人。</p>
<p>但，活，倒底是每一個萬物之靈的人的最本能的要求，而在今天這還是需要錢的社會裏，於是又產生了一種要錢活命的人。</p>
<p>不過，說也奇怪，錢好像是潮水似的，有錢的人，越弄越有錢，也就越發作樂，發威發福起來；苦的，窮的，就越弄越窮，越弄越苦，也越長越乾癟起來！於是，造成了今日一個社會的兩面。</p>
<p>同時，社會上的不寗事件，也就在這「貧」與「富」的分野上相爭，在「苦」與「樂」的差別下搏鬭。</p>
<p>你要錢，我也要錢，於是一切卑鄙無恥，陰險毒辣的手段，大家都挖空了心思去轉念頭，因此，就造成了今天這種奇形的發展！</p>
<p>前天本刊上維揚君的「搶」與「國」的因果一文是指出了「搶」是從「國」造成的；而我更說這種社會現象的基本矛盾是在「貧」與「富」的分野上引起的，想這話是不會有人反划的吧！</p>
<p>因此，我們說，我們是該看到骨子裏去的，我們要把骨髓裹長着的膿，用科學方法來把它抽去，而澈底淸除這裏面的腐爛的細菌。</p>

<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>這是薄暮時候了，天上一團團棉絮似的白雲，已漸漸化成了灰褐色，火一般的太陽，也在半小時前走上了它的末路，祇剩四分之一不到的軀體，還返留在地平綫的上面，從西北那邊發出一些暗紅色的光華來，使空氣裏的熱度，一時無法再降低下去。</p>
<p>就在一家靠近電車路的小酒店裏，有兩個穿短衣的人，在借着夕陽的餘光，一路喝酒，一路說話。</p>
<p>「他媽的！就是這一件事吃不定。」一個臉上瘦得祇剩皮，不見肉的人，睜大了一雙三角眠說：「你想咱們大帥這十幾年來玩了不少女人，誰也沒有生過一個蛋，怎麼偏是這裏的一個倒能給他生起兒子來呢？她這個肚子要不是秋海棠給她弄大的，我季兆雄可以馬上把腦袋割下來！只是想不出那個小子弄了什麽手脚，竟會教生下的孩子一絲兒也不像他，可是也不像咱們大帥！老實說，跟女的也不像，多分是那裏去換來的雜種。」</p>
<p>對面坐着的是一個敞開了前胸，赤腿赤足的少年漢子，耳朶邊斜挿着牛截烟尾，臉上身上，都充分透露着一股混混兒的氣息，芷喝了一口白乾把酒盃放下來。</p>
<p>「說不定你看走了眼也是有的。」</p>

<p>因爲時間還早，慣常喝夜酒的人還沒有來，店堂裏除了他們兩個，就祇剩一个鄕下老頭兒了。</p>

<h3 id="c98">「打花鼓」之我見 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 王奎</p>
<p>昨天本刊上有錢乃江君所作之關於「打花鼓」一文，中間有「本為明代寓革命意義於花鼓女之歌曲中，四鄉宣傳，成為民間之潛勢力，有助於洪武之驅伐元韃，厥功非小。詎今之氍毺上所表演者，竟以巾幗英雄之花鼓女，而易為一變相之賣淫婦矣。」我以此意求教張古愚先生，據張君所告，與錢君之文，殊多未合。張君云：此劇是明初元遺老所撰，雖列入元人雜劇中，而所編時期，實在元末以後，一輩元朝遺老，因力不能復國，乃編是劇，囑優伶演於各地，皆在擾亂民間人心，觀乎一曲鳳陽歌「緊打鼓，慢敲鑼，你老聽我唱栽秧歌，別的歌兒都不唱，聽我唱上鳳陽歌。說鳳陽，道鳳陽，鳳陽本是好地方，自從出了朱皇帝，十年倒有九年荒，大戶人家賣田地，小戶人家賣兒郎，奴家沒有兒郎賣，肩背花鼓走四方。」可以證明是一齣反宣傳的劇本，朱皇帝就是明朝開國的朱元璋，意思是說自從朱元璋出世以後，十年有九年荒，富者變貧，壯者散而之四方。崑曲的本子就是把元人雜劇來改編的，單叫「花鼓」。因為崑曲是士大夫的茶後酒餘的消閒品，俚俗之處，都把牠改得文鄒鄒的，因此失去了真味，不像鳳陽婆沿街賣歌，好似員外府上小丫頭做戲弄，平劇襲其故智，將花鼓孃演成了小姑孃，不像漢子的妻子，賽如漢子的姑娘；又因為小戲都加一「打」字，如「打櫻桃」，「打城隍」，「打灶王」，「打槓子」，因此「花鼓」改為「打花鼓」了。</p>
<p>南方坤且都有這齣戲，北伶中只有毛世來在上海曾經唱過。我所見的華慧麟杜文林韓金奎在黃金合演，最受座客歡迎。杜文林粗魯的動作，蠢愚的神氣，活像一個王八羔子；韓金奎賊搭嗮嗮的面孔，流腔滑調的舉止，真是一位色中餓鬼，充斯文花花公子的態度，中間介一個娇小玲瓏，嫵媚動人的華慧麟，自然是容易討好了。</p>
<p>此劇除了反明色彩以外，我以為還有一些是寫民間夫婦之情感。所以一出場，旦角唱詞就是（身背着花鼓手　着鑼，夫婦恩愛秤不離錘，滿臉容顏俏，也會唱秧歌，穿街過巷兩足快如梭，戲耍的場中呀，那怕人兒多？我的漢子，你打鑼來我把這鼓來助，你打鑼來我把這鼓兒助。）而在尾聲中，又是（受盡風霜苦奔波，只有飢寒沒奈何，咳！漢子呀！同你轉過街和衢，和你再唱歌。）</p>

<p>盛傳珍妮麥唐納將和納爾遜埃迪拆夥，「血淚相思」是他倆的紀念作。這消息已證實不確，原來這是影片公司的反面宣傳。現悉米高梅已以鉅金購進了百老匯著名歌劇「我娶了一個安琪兒」（I　Married　an　Angel）的電影攝製權，將由他倆合作。</p>

<p>「亂世佳人」主角費文麗和她丈夫勞倫斯奧立佛在好萊塢合作拍完記述英國海軍大將納爾遜事業戀愛史的“That　Hamilton　Woman”一片後，就離開美國，悄悄地投進祖國的懷抱中去了。</p>
<p>他倆到了英國的幾天後，美國著名電影女記者洛薏拉潘蓀（Louella　Parsons）就得到英國政府的特准，在紐約用橫跨大西洋的電話綫和遠在倫敦的費文麗作了一次簡單談話。這位女記者認為是從業以來最偉大最興奮的一次訪問，因此特地在Oregonian雜誌上加以發表，使影迷們略知費文麗和她丈夫的近況，現在節譯於下：</p>
<p>當我（洛薏拉自稱）聽到費文麗自遙遠送來的聲音後，我就對她說：「考爾門夫婦，李琪納卡通尼和其他好萊塢的朋友們都向你倆問好，要我轉問一下關於你倆的近況？」</p>
<p>「噢！他們嗎？」她問，「我也得向他們問好，因為我倆覺得應該為國家做些事，所以現在已恨愉快地回到倫敦了！」</p>
<p>啊！她的口音完全不像「亂世佳人」片中施葛蘭的那種語調了。她回到英國後簡直連聲音也變得非常英國化了。於是在電話裏，我開始問她一些正經事。</p>
<p>「你和勞倫斯奧立佛現在做些什麽？」</p>
<p>「勞倫正在拍攝一張叫“49th　Parallel”的影片，我呢，正想預備演一齣戲劇。英國很需要好的娛樂，所以我們也就竭力從這一點上來做一下。」</p>
<p>「現在有許多戲劇上演嗎？」我又問。</p>
<p>「哦！有幾位演員正在工作。」她說，「但似乎很不景氣，“Dear　Brutus”一劇每夜在舞臺上搬演着，這裏的民眾和平日一樣地鎮靜，很有勇氣。」</p>
<p>最後她說：「請告訴好萊塢，把美國影片多送些到這裏來。」</p>

<p>杞縣令冷笑一聲說道：「我初以為你是個孟嘗平原之徒，所以前次土匪來攻的時候，特地請你出來相助守城。誰知你和青石山的匪寇勾通一氣，若不是我明察秋毫，險些兒被你艨蔽過去。」李信急辯道，「怎樣見得我和土匪勾結？我是一個大丈夫，豈肯為賊？」杞縣令道：「不要狡辯！前番你被擄而去，我就有些疑惑；土匪既然大隊來犯，殺死官軍，其勢不小，却爲什麽擒了你一個人去就此退回呢？其中自有破綻。因此我喚齊你的莊丁逐一細問，果然被我問出來了。中間有一個名方胖子的告訴我說，那女匪以前會同伊的同黨到你莊上來，託名賣解，暗中密談過的，你的被擄，其中有詐。」李信聽了，方知那方胖子就是被紅娘子十兄妹打傷過的，因此他啣恨在心了。便道：「我既然和土匪勾通，何不開門揖盜，而反被擄去呢？」杞縣令道：「這個我也思索一番的，又派人到青石山來密探，遂知你已在山上與女匪成親，做了匪首了，料你必要回來，因此不動聲色，暗暗守候。昨天方胖子前來通風，所以今日把你擒住。大約你此次回城，必要和他們裏應外合，糜爛地方，豈肯輕易饒你？」李信長嘆一聲，正要再說時，杞縣令早吩咐公差把李信打入獄中，嚴行看守。一面又去查抄李家莊，將李信的財產盡行藉沒，家人也都看管。備文上報，要把李信處決。李信既入囹　，鐵索郎當，備嘗鐵窗風味，心裏說不出的怨恨。自己爲了不肯降賊，所以想法遁回，豈知反遭此冤，那麼我這條性命豈非白送嗎？我們結　弟兄四人，他們三個都投軍去了，而我獨死在此間，真是冤枉！早知如此，還是在山上和紅娘子一起的好呢。所以終日長吁短嘆，食不下咽。過了幾天，有一個晚上，他正獨坐在黑暗裏，聽聽四邊人聲寂靜，獄中沈寂若死，不覺長嘆了一聲。忽然在他眼前有一小點火光一亮，並非眼花，乃是真的，他心中不由一動。　（第六章完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">US Aid to China Agreement on War Supplies Expected to Be Signed This Week; Soviet Union Provides Assurance to the Chinese Government That It Will Continue to Ship Various Supplies to China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington (Reuters) - Reliable sources indicate that the Sino-American agreement on aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act could be signed before the end of this week. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Reliable sources here reported yesterday that Shao Lizi, the Chinese Ambassador to Moscow, met with Molotov. (Chongqing sources state that Moscow has assured the Chinese government that its policy towards China remains unchanged, which was relayed to the Chinese government by the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union.) (United Press, 17th) Chongqing - Extremely reliable sources disclosed to United Press yesterday that the Soviet Union had assured Chongqing that its policy towards China would not change due to the Soviet-Japanese treaty. The Soviet Union will continue to ship various supplies to China. After the signing of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, the Chinese government telegraphed an inquiry to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which replied with this assurance. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - News from Chongqing that the Soviet Union has notified China, stating that the Soviet-Japanese agreement does not affect aid to China, has been received here with satisfaction and is not considered surprising. The phenomenon of the Soviet Union aiding China on one hand and negotiating with Japan on the other is viewed here as normal behavior for the Soviet Union in today's chaotic political situation. However, this phenomenon is clearly no more confusing than the Japanese situation, where Japan shakes hands with the Soviet Communist Party while fighting against the Chinese Communist Party. People here feel that since Japan and the Soviet Union each have such peculiar backgrounds, it is not difficult to guess the sincerity of their agreement. Therefore, many observers believe that this treaty does not guarantee the security of the Manchurian border. Without this security, Japan cannot transfer large numbers of troops, but can only strengthen its army in China or use it elsewhere in Asia to develop its adventurous actions. Although the real reason for the signing of the Soviet-Japanese treaty is not yet clear, the general consensus is that this treaty does not greatly change the situation in the Pacific or East Asia. Secretary of State Hull's statement that the significance of this treaty should not be overestimated seems to grasp the truth of the situation. In reality, this treaty has damaged Soviet-American relations, as the State Department's feelings towards the Soviet Union have changed almost overnight. This is evident in the reception scheduled to be held by the Soviet Embassy in the United States on Sunday, as many State Department officials who had already accepted invitations to this reception will now not attend. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>New York - A local radio station recently broadcast news that, according to sources in Chongqing, the Soviet government has notified Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that although the Soviet Union has signed a treaty with Japan, it will still continue to aid China. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>New York - American newspapers commented extensively on the importance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact to the international situation. An Associated Press correspondent in London stated that the agreement is not intended to target any country in the East or West. The two countries have no obligations other than strictly maintaining neutrality. (TASS, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The full text of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, released by the German Information Bureau, was published in all newspapers here. According to the bureau, the German side believes that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact greatly contributes to consolidating world peace. The Berliner Tageblatt stated, "The adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations has been properly assessed by Germany." The Deutsche Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz stated, "Several problems in Soviet-Japanese relations that have existed for years have now been eliminated. The German side welcomes this development." (TASS, 17th)</p>

<p>Madavia - A Dutch newspaper commented on the Soviet-Japanese pact, stating it does not believe Japan will attack southward because Japan is still constrained by the American fleet in Hawaii, Singapore, and the war in China. The newspaper stated that it was commenting on the pact at the request of readers to see its reaction. The newspaper stated, "We do not believe that the improvement of Japanese-Dutch relations will lead to an attempt to advance southward. On the surface, the opportunity for southward advancement has indeed increased significantly, but upon closer inspection, the pact does not guarantee the security of Japan's rear. We do not believe that Japan thinks the situation has changed because of the signing of the pact, because Japan's main obstacles, the American navy, Singapore, and the war in China, still exist."

<p>Bangkok - The increasing number of senior American officials visiting Thailand and the Far East has attracted great attention here. In recent days, two American officials have arrived in Thailand, both of whom maintain close contact with the War Department in Washington. Lieutenant Colonel Betty Chia of the US Army and Lieutenant Colonel Yang Yu, the US military attaché, have been in Thailand for some time and have recently traveled to Singapore together.

<p>Chongqing - President Roosevelt's announcement that military aid to China is imminent has been prominently displayed in large characters by all newspapers. An editorial in the Ta Kung Pao stated that whenever a significant diplomatic event occurs in the Far East, the United States always has a timely expression and measure, which is truly an American spirit. In the current situation, if China and the United Kingdom fail, the United States will face disaster. There is no way to retreat, so it has no choice but to accelerate effective measures. Looking further into the future of the human world, the United States may have a special and important mission, which is to lead the world with the American spirit back into the light. To achieve this mission, the United States must fight against the current demons. The newspaper also stated that China cannot escape the responsibility of leading East Asia, and can only accomplish its mission through arduous battles. An editorial in the Shih Shih Hsin Pao briefly stated that China's resistance to Japan does not rely on others, but at the same time welcomes the assistance of all friendly nations, as it can gain endless encouragement in spirit and increase some combat power in practice. In this regard, China should express its gratitude for the United States' increased aid to China. However, since Japan signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, it has no worries about its rear and can transfer troops from the north to advance southward. At this time, when the flames of war are about to spread in the Pacific, it seems insufficient for the United States to only provide military aid to China. Why not stop Japan before it launches an attack? (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Newspapers here are all commenting on the importance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The Danna Shimbun stated that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact is an extremely important event. (TASS, 17th)</p>
<p>Sofia - The Bulgarian newspaper Sula commented on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, stating, "The Soviet Union, whether in the past or in the future, only has one goal in signing treaties, and that goal is to seek peace for the Soviet people and prevent the expansion and deterioration of war."

<p>London - People here now believe that the talk between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky yesterday afternoon was of great importance. It is reported that Eden has expressed to Maisky a desire to improve British-Soviet relations. It is widely believed that the Soviet ambassador will reiterate the Soviet view to Eden and argue that before discussing other broad issues, Britain should state its attitude towards the Soviet annexation of the three Baltic states. It is also reported that the Soviet ambassador will also mention the fate of the Baltic ships and the issue of sending more than 500 Baltic sailors back to their country. It is widely believed that the increasing seriousness of the German threat to the Dardanelles Strait must be of great concern to the Soviet Union, as some observers believe that the German advance towards this important strait may make the Soviet Union more receptive to the suggestion of improving relations with Britain.

<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters that the United States would send troops to Danish Greenland, escorted by warships, and that the island's coastal defense would also be managed by the Navy Department. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that British ships coming to the United States for repairs will enjoy preferential treatment in US Navy shipyards. This may slightly hinder the US shipbuilding program, but he hopes that the realization of a two-ocean navy will not be delayed as a result. The British battleship HMS Malaya, which recently arrived in New York, is the first British ship to enter an American port solely for repairs. The possibility of US ships escorting ships to Greenland is not convenient to discuss at this time, but the US Navy has such a plan in mind, as any well-managed navy is prepared for all kinds of contingencies, and this is one of them. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox said that the US government is studying the British request that the US take over commercial shipping routes in the Pacific. Knox said that the recent arrival of the British battleship HMS Malaya in New York "is the harbinger of a large number of British ships coming to our docks." Knox warned the public not to reveal the whereabouts of these ships to prevent loss of life and ships. Knox promised to keep the arrival of British warships in the United States strictly confidential, stating that British ships should now enter American ports under cover of darkness.

<p>Washington - Rumor has it that Japan has agreed to "lend" warships to Germany for use in attacking British ships in the Pacific. This news was raised at a meeting yesterday between US Undersecretary of State Welles, British Chargé d'Affaires Butler, and Australian Minister Casey to inquire with Butler. Butler replied, "This move is extremely serious. The Japanese are quite cautious. I don't think they would take this step." At the same meeting, Casey and Butler requested that the United States take over British shipping routes in the Pacific so that British ships could be withdrawn to transport supplies in the Pacific. Butler also said that British ships cannot break free in the Pacific, and this problem "urgently needs" to be solved. Shipping circles here said that the news of Germans driving Japanese ships is "ridiculous." It is said, "Everyone knows that the coastal warships of Japan are very small, and it is already not easy for Germans to fit inside, let alone drive them." It was also pointed out that various operating mechanisms are marked in Japanese, and the Germans' confusion in driving Japanese ships will be even greater than that of the British navy driving the German ships captured in Scapa Flow. They also laughed and said, "Japanese ships may have left-hand operating mechanisms. If the news is true, the German navy will face a major capability test." (International News Service)</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Soviet-Japanese Agreement and Japan's Southern Advance <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Soviet and Japanese governments published the full text of the neutrality treaty signed in Moscow. The world was in an uproar, analyzing and judging it from various angles, becoming the largest source of material for newspapers in various countries in recent days. We have no time to review them one by one, but our impression is quite different from theirs. Soviet newspapers are the most wonderful. Their views on this do not fall into the usual clichés, because they do not praise it as friendship between the two countries or pray for it as peace in East Asia, but directly point out that this is the result of Japan's understanding of the Soviet Union. Indeed, in this situation, the Soviet Union does have the qualifications to be so proud. However, to make such a statement before the envoy has even left the country seems too naive to observers, and those who hear it may inevitably feel insulted. US Secretary of State Hull is the most detached, believing that the world overestimates its importance. This newspaper is fortunate that its previous argument was not wrong, believing that the Soviet Union will not stop aiding China because of this, and Japan will not take this as an immediate factor in its southward advance. These two points are the accumulation of the world's concerns and indignation in the past five days, and after five days, they have gradually become clearer. At least, as reported in yesterday's telegram, the Soviet authorities have assured Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that the policy of aiding China will absolutely not change, which has an even more clarifying and absolute effect.</p>
<p>As for the already existing problem of Japan's southward advance, we believe that the broad southward advance, such as political and economic advances, has already begun in French Indochina and Thailand. As for the military launch of a southward advance, it is narrow in scope. Japan, at least for now, does not have the courage or the strength for this, and it depends on the European war situation showing a clear German victory and British defeat. The Soviet Union and Japan have concluded a neutrality treaty, which does indeed legally relieve Japan of its worries about its northern rear. This legal aspect is unequivocally recognized by everyone, but everyone wants to fully reserve what is beyond the legal aspect. Moreover, the mechanism for formulating national policy and the basis for implementing national policy both transcend the scope of legal principles, and Japan has long hesitated to approach its southward advance due to concerns about its northern rear. Therefore, the mere fact that it no longer has legal concerns about its northern rear is not enough to conclude that Japan will therefore advance southward. Japan's international isolation in recent years has undergone a change in appearance due to the signing of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy last autumn. If one asks what actual benefits Japan has gained, the Japanese are silent. This treaty with the Soviet Union, in order to resolve the so-called China Incident and prepare for the so-called future of southward advance, seems to have a similar superficial brilliance. If one asks what this treaty ultimately contributes to what is aspired to, the Japanese will inevitably be silent again. After the facade is painted, isolation is still isolation. As for the close parallel policies adopted by Britain and the United States in the Far East after the Tripartite Pact, and the US statement of substantial aid to China and the Soviet statement of continued aid to China after the Soviet-Japanese treaty, these are merciless wounds after the facade is painted.</p>
<p>Of course, it is always progress and expansion from a southward advance still having worries about its northern rear to a southward advance having no legal worries about its northern rear. It is not permissible to regard it as equal to zero simply because it is only slightly better than nothing. Moreover, stating that Japan does not have the courage and strength for a southward advance only refers to the present and does not determine its entire future. Underestimating Japan, or underestimating any opponent, is not permissible, or we will repeat the mistakes of Italy towards Greece and Japan towards China. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "moment when a German victory and British defeat are clearly visible," even if we believe that Britain will ultimately be victorious, there are still many fragments and many opportunities that can be regarded as "a German victory and British defeat." Italy chose the timing of its participation in the war last year, and the timing it chose was one of the past fragments and opportunities. This lesson is painful enough, and this example is clear enough. The most ambitious hardliners in Japan differ from Mussolini only in degree. For this reason, what constitutes a German victory and a British defeat is for the Japanese to weigh and choose, and it is likely different from us. However, we sympathize with one saying that was reported yesterday: that a secret alliance was formed between Germany and Japan, and that the day German forces advance to the Suez Canal will be the day Japan begins military action against Britain. This saying is indeed confidential, that is, there is absolutely no way to prove whether there is a secret alliance between Germany and Japan and whether the contents of the secret alliance are as described. However, examining the facts and circumstances, it is credible. If one says that Japan has no sincere intention to side with Germany and participate in the war, or that Japan estimates that the German army will not be able to reach the Suez Canal, and thus the contents of the reported secret alliance are used to falsely appease Germany, there is no reason for us to object. Otherwise, we can no longer find a better time and conditions for Japan to participate in the war. The arrival of German forces on the banks of the Suez Canal is another fragment of a German victory and a British defeat; Japan's commencement of military action against Britain is the main form of the so-called southward advance.</p>
<p>Why do we sympathize with this saying? Japan, like any war-mongering country, takes minimizing sacrifices in exchange for maximizing gains as the ultimate principle. A complete Britain is not something Japan wants to bet everything on and confront. When Britain is divided into several pieces, it is precisely what Japan considers a "dog in the water," which it can hit and share a piece of. Britain is built on its navy. Although its fleet travels irregularly and gathers and disperses unpredictably, a rough division can be made into three areas: west of the Strait of Gibraltar, and the entire Atlantic Ocean; from Gibraltar to the Suez Canal, including the entire Mediterranean Sea; and west of the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean, and the Far East. Destroying British maritime hegemony is very difficult, something that only Hitler would think of. But once it is divided, Japan has a comparative advantage in naval power east of the Suez Canal. The time to strike is then! And the German-Italian forces are fighting in North Africa, winning several battles recently, and invading Egypt, truly advancing towards the Suez Canal. Britain is not pessimistic at this point. If Japan has a secret alliance with Germany as reported, then it is starting to tremble under the emotion of worrying about gains and losses, and being hesitant and fearful. Why tremble? Betting everything on the navy is a dangerous path. Although it has an advantage in dealing with a divided Britain, what about the United States?</p>

<p>Fancheng: The battle for the peripheral strongholds south of Dahong Mountain is intensifying. Qingfeng Mountain was captured by a certain Chinese regiment on the 13th at Chenshi (7-9 AM), but in the afternoon, the Japanese reinforced with over a thousand troops, coordinating with machine guns and artillery to launch a counterattack, resulting in fierce fighting. At Ershi (1-3 PM) on the 14th, another thousand-plus Japanese troops advanced to Kedianpo, invading Tongzichong and the Fenshuiling area to the north, engaging in fierce combat with the Chinese. The fighting subsided slightly at dusk, but the Chinese fiercely drove them back in the evening, launching a counterattack from the right flank. As of the morning of the 15th, Chinese and Japanese forces were still fiercely fighting near Bazhehe and Kedianpo.

<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson announced today that the large-scale concentration of Chinese forces at Dahong Mountain has threatened the Japanese positions south of Zhongxiang and east of Suixian on the east bank of the Hanshui River. In order to eliminate the Chinese forces on Dahong Mountain, the Japanese forces in Zhongxiang and Suixian launched an offensive a week ago, with a force of 10,000, supported by aircraft and artillery. On April 10th, the Japanese troops in Zhongxiang advanced towards the southern foothills of Dahong Mountain in three routes. After the Chinese army repelled the left and central wings of the Japanese army, they immediately pursued the central route of the Japanese army towards the southeast. The Japanese right wing then launched a fierce attack on the 13th, hoping to support the central route of the Japanese army, firing 3,000 shells at the Chinese positions in one day. The two sides are currently contesting the key strongholds on the southern periphery of Dahong Mountain, and the fighting is very intense. The Japanese troops in Suixian shifted westward on the 13th, but after encountering strong resistance from the Chinese army, they turned south. The spokesperson believes that the Chinese army will be able to repel the Japanese offensive. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission said that the war situation this week was relatively quiet. Apart from the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi still working to clear the battlefield, only the Japanese army's so-called "Dahong Mountain Sweep" is worth reporting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Hubei: Dahong Mountain has always been defended by the Chinese army during years of fighting. Last year, the Japanese army launched the Xiangdong Battle, but still failed to force the Chinese to leave the mountain. The Chinese army held this mountain, which could threaten Jingzhong to the south and flank Suixian to the east. Therefore, the Japanese finally felt unable to rest easy. Furthermore, in view of the successive defeats in western Hubei and northern Jiangxi, they wanted to gain something here to compensate for previous losses, so they rashly launched the so-called "Dahong Mountain Sweep." Their deployment was a pincer attack from the north and south. In the southern part of the mountain, Zhongxiang was used as a base, and on the morning of the 10th, they began to advance northward in three routes. One route had over a thousand men, with eight artillery pieces, attacking Chang'an from Anzi. Another route had over two thousand men, with four artillery pieces, attacking Xujiadian from Guniuling. Another route divided into the vicinity of Wangjialing and Shaojiatai. In the northern part of the mountain, Maping and Zhehe in Suixian were used as bases, and on the morning of the 12th, they also launched attacks in three or four routes. One route had over a thousand men, passing through Youshan, Huangjiapeng from Maping. Another route had over a thousand men, passing through Dakangpo and Hejiadian from Zhehe, to attack Sanwenhu. The other route reached the vicinity of Junchuan. The Chinese army had already made arrangements to counter the Japanese coming from the south with a fierce counterattack, forcing the Japanese to reinforce repeatedly, resulting in the contest for the high slopes of Qingfeng Mountain, Mao'erzhai, Shiziwei, and Nanzhuangtai continuing for more than ten rounds. Currently, they are still facing each other at Fenshuiling. The Japanese coming from the north were intercepted by the Chinese in the Sanwenhu, Hejiadian, and Guanzhuangdian area. Feeling the pressure of Chinese firepower, the Japanese retreated south towards Liudian and Guchengfan on the morning of the 14th. Currently, the Chinese army is expanding its victory. Another major victory is naturally expected. In addition,</p>
<p>Eastern Guangdong: After the Chinese army recovered Gongpingxu at 1:00 AM on the 13th, they simultaneously recovered Haifeng at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi: Southeast of Lüxian, the Chinese army captured important strongholds such as Dongsangchi, Menghukou, Zaoniyi, and Lianhuachi on the morning of the 13th. The Japanese retreated to Xisangchi and Nanhe. The Chinese are in the process of annihilating them. Although these are all small-scale battles, the Chinese are constantly winning, accumulating small victories into large victories. This is exactly what it means. (Telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>London: The British War Office announces that the German claim of a break in the Allied line in the Olympus Mountains, allowing them to directly enter the Larissa Plain, has not been verified by the Greek army or the British Command in Greece.

<p>London: The War Office declared yesterday that the Greek campaign now has the appearance of a "full-scale" battle as Allied and Axis forces are engaged in fighting along the entire front. Given the constant increase of German pressure, large-scale flanking maneuvers or an all-out assault are deemed inevitable. According to reports from Ankara, Germany has concentrated between 60 and 65 divisions in the Balkans, totaling roughly one million men, with 35 of those divisions coming from Bulgaria. The Greek army claims to have repelled German advances on both flanks, but due to the collapse of Yugoslav resistance, it is believed that German pressure will increase. However, guerilla warfare is expected to continue in the highlands. Military circles stated that while German pressure is increasing, reports from Ankara stating that German forces have broken through any Allied defense lines are baseless.

British forces are cooperating with the Greek army, and have attacked and severely damaged German mechanized columns in multiple locations.

<p>Athens: After the British Air Force destroyed a bridge over the Vardar River in the Vevi region of southern Yugoslavia, German forces have been halted in central southern Serbia. All the British planes responsible for this difficult mission returned safely. When British pilots were ordered to attack the Vardar River bridge at night, they knew that the bridge was a major transportation hub in central southern Serbia and would be heavily defended. When the British planes arrived, German searchlights swept the sky and anti-aircraft fire was intense. However, none of the British bombers were damaged. One pilot circled four times through the fire, taking aim before dropping the bombs. The first batch of bombs destroyed the bridge, and the second batch hit nearby railway lines. Surrounding houses also caught fire after being hit by bombs. When other British planes arrived, they saw that the bridge had been broken and immediately shifted their targets, bombing stranded Nazi armored vehicles, achieving considerable success.

Items such as olive oil, olives, rice, lemons, fish, textiles, cotton, silk, iron, lead, and copper can all be transported from Seville, Greece, and Turkey to Romania. Therefore, the cooperative relationship between Romania and the Balkan countries will become even closer in the future, proving the importance of Romania's political activities to the Axis powers.

<p>London: The British Admiralty announced that an enemy convoy sailing from Sicily to Tripoli (an Italian port in North Africa) on Tuesday night, consisting of five supply ships escorted by three destroyers, was completely sunk by the British Navy. Two of the supply ships, each carrying 5,000 tons, were fully loaded with motorized transport vehicles and have been lost. Another ship, carrying 4,000 tons and fully loaded with munitions, exploded after being hit. The remaining two ships, each carrying 3,000 tons, also exploded. Of the three escorting Italian destroyers, one was the "Tarigo" (1,628 tons), and the other two were smaller, all of which were sunk. The British destroyer "Mohawk" was unfortunately hit by a torpedo and sunk. Most of the crew, including the commanding officer, have been rescued. The "Mohawk" weighed 1,870 tons, had a crew of 109, and was armed with eight 4.7-inch guns, seven smaller guns, and four 21-inch torpedo tubes. It was damaged in a raid on the Firth of Forth in December of the previous year. The Germans claimed last year that the ship had been sunk. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to statistics released here, U.S. investment in China, including the fourth decision to grant China a credit loan of ten thousand years in November of last year, totals $376,000,000 (excluding investment in Manchuria). (According to statistics from Professor Lehman of the University of Michigan, ten years ago, the total amount of U.S. investment in China was only $196,824,124, of which $155,112,778 was in commerce. The remainder was lent to the Chinese government, American churches, and charitable organizations, with assets of $43,071,289 not included. Since the Yangtze River flood in 1931, the United States first provided a wheat loan of $9 million, and then a cotton-wheat loan of $50 million to China. It also purchased 45% of the stock in China National Aviation Corporation. Therefore, when the statistics were recalculated in 1935, investment in China had reached $200 million, not including investment in Manchuria. In January 1938, the U.S. Department of Commerce released statistics showing that investment in China had increased to $202,000,000, including $40 million in assets of American churches and charitable organizations. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, American businesses have invested heavily in Free China. For example, Curtiss-Wright Corporation invested $4 million to establish an aircraft manufacturing plant. As for the funds lent to the Chinese government by the United States since the War of Resistance, they total $170 million.) (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Cairo: The situation in the Libyan war has remained stable for the past four days. Patrol activities continue in the Sollum area on the Egyptian border, with occasional fierce battles. The enemy has suffered several thousand casualties. There is currently no sign that the Nazis have increased the strength of their vanguard. British warships are constantly bombarding the coast, harassing the enemy. A Naval Department communique states that enemy forces and convoys on the mountain roads west of Sollum have been frequently bombarded, causing significant damage. The Gazala airfield west of Sollum has also been shelled by British warships, destroying at least five enemy aircraft on the ground. In the past 24 hours, the British Air Force has attacked German and Italian forces in Cyrenaica day and night. A British Air Force communique states that enemy forces concentrated between Agedabia, Tobruk, and Bardia were heavily bombed throughout the day on Sunday, causing significant damage. British aircraft on patrol also strafed enemy forces. Australian aircraft intercepted four German transport aircraft over the Gabzsau gun emplacements, one of which was immediately shot down, while the remaining three crashed upon landing and were completely destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Military sources here reported yesterday that British forces in Libya are attacking German and Italian forces along the Cyrenaican coast from Cabzsau onwards.

<p>London: It was learned yesterday that a large contingent of British Royal Army forces, fresh from conquering East Africa, are now in the western desert, crossing the sand-blasted landscape, en route to the Libyan front lines to counter the German and Italian blitzkrieg threatening Alexandria and the Suez Canal. These British, Scottish, Australian, and Indian troops, who have driven the Duke of Aosta's forces out of British and Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia, are eager to face the German armored divisions. Most of these troops wear large goggles and cover their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs or face masks to protect themselves from the invading sand, while others wear gas masks.

<p>Cairo: According to well-informed sources here, an envoy sent by Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, the Duke of Aosta, has arrived at General Cunningham's headquarters in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, Italian prisoners continue to be brought to the capital in a steady stream. Several large units of Italian troops have been completely captured. A communique released in Nairobi states that the number of local soldiers deserting the Italian side is increasing daily, and some have even formed their own units to fight against the Italian army. Italian Divisional General Besanti was captured by British forces while traveling between Addis Ababa and a certain village and is now being held in the bedroom formerly occupied by Italian Commander General Santini. Colonel Lorry, a prominent Italian local commander, along with 11 staff officers and 700 local soldiers, was intercepted near Agordat by two South African British officers leading 17 soldiers. Furthermore, two enemy units, each with 600 men, surrendered separately and even opened fire on each other, resulting in six deaths, before being captured by a South African regiment. British forces are currently pursuing the retreating Italian forces in three key areas: the Mussolini Pass (100 miles from Addis Ababa), the Arussi Mountains (east of Lake Abyssinia), and the banks of the Umo River (en route to Gimma). Patriotic Abyssinian forces are assisting British forces in defeating the Italian forces led by the Duke of Aosta, but they do not attack Italian soldiers surrendering to the British lines.

<p>London: Shortly after the air raid sirens sounded in London last night, a major air raid, rare in recent days, occurred. Waves of enemy planes swarmed into the London skies, anti-aircraft guns roared, and flares illuminated the streets in a certain suburban area. German planes were flying lower than before. Minutes after the alarm sounded, a German bomber was shot down at an altitude of around 5,000 feet. Several high-explosive bombs fell in a certain area of London. British fighter planes scrambled to intercept, and machine guns were heard incessantly. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hundreds of German fighter planes bombed London last night for six and a half hours, in the most intense air raid on London. This air raid began at 10 p.m. last night and ended at 4:30 a.m. this morning. German planes dropped hundreds of explosive bombs and over 10,000 incendiary bombs. There were 80 major fires in the bombed areas, and fires broke out in other locations as well.

<h3 id="e50">A Grand View of the United States Navy <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The roaring cannons shake the heavens – this is what is called the final moment; everything else is just preparatory work. Apart from the "mouths" of the cannons, nothing else matters; the "mouths" are the 14-inch and 16-inch cannons installed on those battleships. In the midst of battle, the four turrets, each with three cannons, on the "Iowa" simultaneously bombarded the enemy; the intervals between the twelve deafening roars were extremely brief. Twelve crimson fireballs glided across the oil-green surface of the sea. When the cannons fired, the entire ship seemed to suffer a sudden impact and shook violently. As the 120-ton cannons recoiled six feet, the entire ship would be shaken and would list sideways on the water. A minute later, the two tons of gunpowder and steel would hit the enemy ship fifteen miles away.</p>
<p>Tactically, the commander-in-chief has done everything he possibly can. Now it depends on his gunners to sink the enemy ship before their own is sunk. In the high observation tower on the ship, the crew directing the bearings are firmly "fixed" on the enemy ship, constantly turning the bearing wheel, making sure there is no deviation. Deep in the hidden part of the ship's belly, in a small, brightly lit war operations room, officers are carefully calculating the trajectory, bearings, velocity, and target angle of the cannon fire. The commander-in-chief stands on the bridge, clenching his teeth, intently observing whether his own ships have suffered damage, and also paying attention to the extent of the enemy's damage, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>All the numerical results calculated in the observation tower and war operations room are transmitted by electric motors to the dials in the four turrets. The personnel inside then turn the turrets according to the indicated degrees and elevate the cannons to the exact position. In that instant, the ship maintains its level, aimed at the enemy ship. The personnel in the command tower press the button, and all the cannons fire simultaneously. However, if such quiet and scientific movements encounter accurate cannon fire from the enemy hitting one's own ship, the entire ship will fall into an indescribable state of chaos in an instant.</p>
<p>Such a great double task takes, at most, half an hour. Finally, the American fleet breaks through the enemy's vanguard, first sinking the first ship, followed by several warships in the center. Many of the remaining enemy ships either fled or were unable to move after being hit, and lowered their flags in surrender. The naval battle thus came to an end.</p>
<p>Cleaning up the aftermath on the sea surface - after the roar of the cannons subsided, a peaceful scene appeared on the sea surface. The remnants of the enemy warships gradually disappeared on the horizon, undoubtedly struggling there after being damaged. Although the American naval fleet won, it also suffered considerable damage. Even if the warships were still floating on the water and had not sunk, some of the ships were severely damaged. Ten or so cruisers and twenty or so destroyers were either sunk or rendered useless. Wreckage and broken hulls were floating everywhere on the water.</p>
<p>Shortly after, several undamaged destroyers sped over and rescued the drowning and wounded officers and soldiers from many small boats and sinking ships, and transferred them to heavy cruisers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Doctors and priests were already waiting in the operating rooms to treat their wounds. Those with very serious injuries were sent to hospital ships stationed at naval bases for treatment. Even the seriously wounded enemy prisoners were given the same emergency treatment.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to immediately calculate the ships and personnel lost on both sides in a naval battle like the one described above. There are only a few large-scale naval battles in modern history. Each time a battle is fought, the number of warships damaged and the number of officers and soldiers killed on both sides is quite considerable. During the last World War, in the Battle of Jutland, the British lost three battleships, three cruisers, and eight destroyers. The German side lost one battleship, one battlecruiser, four light cruisers, and five destroyers. A total of eight thousand six hundred and forty-two officers and soldiers lost their lives on both sides. However, even today, historians call this naval battle "not a decisive battle."</p>
<p>Even in practice battles, sailors are truly injured. Some people are burned in the gun turrets, and some aviation pilots are injured when landing on the surface of the sea in the midst of huge waves. The wooden hulls of warships can sometimes be damaged as well. When large ships bombard, the shock is very severe, causing light bulbs to explode and even thick water pipes to burst open. Soldiers are specially stationed on the ships to repair them.</p>

<p>The Special Meeting of Ratepayers and the Annual General Meeting, convened by Consul General Leader Hill, were held one after another at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Security was tight inside and outside the venue. McDonald, who failed to be elected as a board member last year, attempted to prevent the convening of the special meeting on the grounds of illegal procedures and insufficient quorum, but was unsuccessful as no one seconded the motion. The meeting proceeded smoothly according to the agenda, and adjourned in just 45 minutes at 3:15 PM. The important matters passed included the Special Meeting's resolution to authorize the current Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council to request representatives of the countries involved to agree to establish a Provisional Board of Directors to continue handling the administration of the Settlement. It is noteworthy that only the change of Chinese directors to four was reported, and the nominees were not announced. The Annual General Meeting resolved to authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect/supplement various proposed taxes and fees, and to raise temporary funds of one million yuan.</p>
<p>The number of ratepayers from various countries attending yesterday was less than at previous meetings held this year, with only over one thousand people present. This was likely because important resolutions had already been agreed upon behind the scenes by the authorities of various countries, so many people abstained from attending. Government officials present included U.S. Assessor's Office Judge Hermick, Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Cornaby, Secretary-General Phillips, Financial Officer Mo Chao, American Director Myers, Allemann, Japanese Director Okamoto Ikusaku, Hao Yuta Kuo, and others.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Special General Meeting <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Opposition to the Meeting Prevents Formation: At 2:30 PM, Chairman Keswick announced the start of the meeting. First, a special general meeting was held, electing Judge Helm as chairman and Betts as secretary. This was unanimously approved. When Chairman Keswick finished speaking, McDonald, a British lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the Board of Directors last year, took the stage and made startling remarks: "This meeting may as well be dismissed, and you can all return home. Attendees must be true human beings. Many present are dubious individuals and do not constitute a quorum." Judge Helm dismissed his comments as untrue. McDonald continued, "The term of the Provisional Board of Directors must be no less than one year, trending towards more than one year. This is a most serious problem. Although I may be forced to stop speaking, I am compelled to speak. This Provisional Board is a cursed resolution that I can never support. If you vote in favor, your death is near!" The crowd laughed uncontrollably, but no one applauded in agreement. Keswick's speech had been published in the newspapers beforehand and was not repeated, saving considerable time. Issues that had caused fierce debates in previous years were not even mentioned at this meeting. When item five of the agenda, the 1941 budget, was passed, the Municipal Council's music team's life was extended for two months.</p>
<p>Amendment to Land Regulations Passed</p>
<p>The chairman then announced that item three, the Yamakawa proposal, would be discussed. Keswick, the proposer, read the original proposal: "Please pass the amendment to the 'Appendices' of the Land Regulations and new appendices published in the Municipal Council Gazette on March 31st. The order of the clauses should follow the Gazette's arrangement, but delete 'Clause 4' of the new Appendix 52. Also, change the wording of 'Clause 3' of the same article to 'If the decision of the Municipal Council or the Appeals Committee becomes final and legally effective, the Municipal Council may implement this decision and collect taxes in accordance with Articles 10 and 20 of the Land Regulations.'" The chairman called for a vote, first asking those in favor to raise their hands, which a majority did. Then, he asked those against to raise their hands, but no one did. The chairman announced that the proposal was passed.</p>
<p>Resolution to Change the Administrative Structure</p>
<p>Next, item four was discussed, proposed by Keswick and seconded by Okamoto. They both stood up and read the proposal in English and Japanese: "(1) Authorize the current Board of Directors to request the representatives of the relevant countries to agree to establish a Provisional Board of Directors to continue administering the Public Settlement. Once the Provisional Board is established, the current Board should resign immediately. The candidates for the Provisional Board should be A.H. George, Carlile, Cholerton, Hanawa Yutaro, Liddell, MacDonald, Dr. Minsde, Mitchell, Powell, Crone, Yajima Yasuzo, Okamoto Ikkaku, along with four Chinese directors. (2) Within its term, the Provisional Board should suggest to the residents of the Public Settlement and the representatives of the relevant countries to consider a municipal system more satisfactory than that stipulated by the current Land Regulations." The original proposal was published in the Mokubo on April 10th. The chairman called for a vote, and the majority raised their hands in favor, so the proposal was passed.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Expressing Opinions</p>
<p>When item four of the agenda was proposed for discussion, Keswick, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, stood up and said: "As the Chairman of the Municipal Council, I propose item four for the General Meeting to discuss. This proposal is seconded by my colleague Mr. Okamoto and is of great importance to the public. I would like to ask you to seek the agreement of the representatives of the relevant countries to establish a Provisional Board of Directors of sixteen members to continue administering the Public Settlement, and to approve the proposed list of sixteen directors. If this proposal is passed, it can be said that a step has been taken to expand the number of directors. The solution to the problems we face depends on the cooperation of all responsible individuals in the Public Settlement, regardless of their nationality. According to Section (D) of the first section of the proposal, the Provisional Board of Directors should be granted all the powers of the Municipal Council and the foreign taxpayer community. I believe that most of you present will agree that the time has come to adopt another institution to replace the foreign taxpayer meeting. The procedure based on a small market town meeting is no longer applicable to one of the largest cities in the world. The proposal also stipulates that within its term, the Provisional Board of Directors should suggest considering a more satisfactory municipal system. The tax system is of great importance to you, and I would like to emphasize that there is a widespread perception among the public that the scope of the Bureau's tax collection should be expanded. A committee of the Bureau is continuing to meet and review the new tax system. Until the committee prepares to submit a report, it is impossible to specify which specific new tax system should be adopted. I suggest that, as in Section (F) of the first section of this proposal, the Provisional Board of Directors be granted broad and general taxation powers. In this regard, I dare to state that the original proposal clearly stipulates that this power must be exercised after consulting with an advisory committee selected from the residents of the Public Settlement. I believe that once a satisfactory new advisory body is discovered, you will have more genuine opportunities to express your opinions on the tax system than you do now. I now ask you to warmly support this proposal, and I am confident that your action will usher in a new era of international cooperation in the Public Settlement."</p>
<p>Okamoto's Speech Urging Assistance</p>
<p>Okamoto Ikkaku then gave a brief speech as the seconder: "I am honored to second the previous proposal. As a director of the Municipal Council, I have learned over the past year that the solution to some of the city's problems depends on the goodwill and cooperation of all resident groups in the Public Settlement. If you pass this proposal, it can be said that you have taken a major step towards promoting cooperation. You should note that the proposal does not ignore the issue of creating a more satisfactory municipal body. The Provisional Board of Directors will face many difficulties in the coming year and will need the loyalty and assistance of all responsible citizens of the Public Settlement to cope with them. I now ask you to pass this proposal and encourage us by showing your faith in us."</p>

<p>Election of Real Estate Committee for Next Year</p>
<p>After the special general meeting ended, the annual general meeting continued, with Helm as chairman and Betts as secretary. (1) Discussion of item three: The rules of procedure that were valid at the last annual meeting are still used in this meeting and remain valid until the next meeting. Resolved and passed. (2) Discussion of item four: Election of Mr. Ashbeak as a member of the Real Estate Committee for the coming year. Passed. (3) Discussion of item five: Election of Dr. Halli, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Borst, and Dr. Minsde as directors of the Public Hospital for the coming year. Resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Approval of Budget and its Recommendations</p>
<p>(4) Discussion of item seven: Please pass the 1941 budget of the Municipal Council, along with the attached recommendations, and authorize the Bureau to collect or supplement all proposed taxes and fees. If it is deemed appropriate, please approve the Bureau to raise a total of no more than 9 million yuan, or its equivalent, in a manner and on terms it deems appropriate, to cover the various uses specified in the temporary budget. Resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Passing the Tax System Committee Report</p>
<p>(5) Discussion of item eight: Please pass the report of the Committee on Studying Tax System Inequality (a document agreed to by a majority of the committee members). However, the implementation of Recommendations 2 and 3 in the report should be left to the new Board of Directors for consideration. Resolved and passed. (6) Discussion of item six: Please pass the 1940 Municipal Council Report and Accounts. Resolved and passed. Since Chairman Keswick had already issued a written report on the Municipal Council's past administration the night before, he did not stand up to explain when items six and seven were proposed for discussion, and no taxpayer present gave a speech. Therefore, the meeting proceeded smoothly and adjourned at 3:15 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Shanghai Branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Suspended Business Yesterday, Maintaining the Entire Financial System, Speculative Market Fluctuations Can Be Suppressed <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Central, China, Communications, and Chinese Farmers Banks, their Shanghai branches, and their affiliated branch offices all announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday morning due to the security of employees. However, they allowed for the continued maintenance of Shanghai's financial system, so the entire financial system remained stable. Rumors arose in the speculative market, causing slight fluctuations, but these were unrelated to the overall situation and are expected to be quelled.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Temporarily Suspended Operations Yesterday</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank's Albert Road Shanghai Branch and Baker Road Office; (2) The China Bank's Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch and Tongfu Road Intersection, Eight Immortals Bridge, Xinzha Road, Jing'an Temple, and Nanshi Boundary Road Hongkou Offices, and wartime retreat offices in Shanghai; (3) The Bank of Communications Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch, Jing'an Temple, Min'guo Road, Nanjing Road three branches, and retreat offices in the Zhen District, Zhe District, and Hu District; (4) The Chinese Farmers Bank Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch and Avenue Albert Road Office all announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday. The iron gates of each bank were tightly closed, and a notice was posted saying "Closed for business today."</p>
<p>Temporary Nature, Instructions Requested from Head Office</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks that the decision to suspend business was temporary. Since the shooting of a China Bank employee at the China Bank villa, the employees of the Four Banks temporarily did not go to work due to security concerns. As a result, each bank was unable to open for business yesterday. It is said that after consulting with each other, the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks wired their head offices yesterday requesting instructions on how to proceed. Until clear instructions are received, they have decided to temporarily suspend business. All bills and receipts will be processed on the day of resumption. The Central Bank's Shanghai branch temporarily suspended its official exchange rate and equalization tax quotations yesterday.</p>
<p>Market Funds Still Very Ample</p>
<p>Regarding the maintenance of the entire Shanghai financial system by the Four Banks, Shanghai is the only major port in the Far East, the center of national and foreign trade, and the hub of Chinese finance. To take into account the legitimate trade of Chinese and foreign merchants and the interests of the city's residents, this has been maintained. Therefore, although the Four Banks have temporarily suspended business, the entire financial system remains stable. (1) The black market foreign exchange is being maintained through the joint cooperation of the Exchange Equalization Fund and various allied banks, and legitimate needs of various industries are being supplied as much as possible. (2) The finances of various industries are being adjusted by various banks to maintain their long-term stability. There is no tension in the market's money supply.</p>
<p>Speculative Black Market Slightly Fluctuates</p>
<p>Shanghai's various speculative markets, such as the black markets for gold, foreign stocks, Chinese securities, and cotton yarn, have been manipulated by speculators. Since the news of the Four Banks' temporary suspension of business was released, speculators have taken the opportunity to monopolize, causing slight fluctuations in the speculative market yesterday. The black market for foreign exchange slightly contracted, and the black market for gold rose sharply. However, this situation is unrelated to the overall financial system and is an unavoidable fact in Shanghai, where there is an abundance of floating capital. The value of various commodities has also changed accordingly, but this situation will soon be quelled.</p>
<p>Resumption of Business in the Near Future</p>
<p>United Press Chongqing, 17th: A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance told United Press today that the Shanghai branches of all government banks will continue to operate regardless of the circumstances. The spokesman also said that the Ministry of Finance had not yet received official news of the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks' suspension of business today. The National Government has repeatedly decided to maintain the Shanghai branches of all government banks until now. The spokesman also said that the Shanghai branches of government banks are open to the public of Shanghai. Meanwhile, banking circles pointed out that the Shanghai branches' temporary suspension of business due to the urgent situation should not be considered a permanent closure. Well-informed banking circles claim that the head offices of the Four Banks in this area are eager to do their best to maintain the Shanghai branches.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Japanese Military Police, Together with Chinese, Attempt to Take Over the Taxpayers' Association but are Prevented, The Police Department Sends Detectives to Guard the Association, Lengthy Talks Between the Two Sides Yield No Results <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that at 10:45 AM this morning (the 17th), a team of Japanese military police led by Major Du, together with plainclothes Chinese, attempted to take over the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association located in the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road, but were prevented by the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) and were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Having Received Prior Notice, Detectives Were Sent to Guard</p>
<p>The Police Department, anticipating this Japanese attempt, sent two Western detectives and three Chinese detectives from the Central Police Station to guard the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. Just minutes later, three Japanese military police and several Chinese also arrived at the location, intending to break into and occupy the association, but were refused by the police officers.</p>
<p>The Two Sides Were Deadlocked, Permission to Enter Was Not Granted</p>
<p>Upon receiving a report, the Central Police Station immediately dispatched patrol officers Bowtie and Moore, leading a team, to rush to reinforce. At this time, another fifteen Japanese military police and Chinese, many carrying firearms, arrived in three cars, arriving at the scene before the patrol police. The Central Police, upon hearing the news, also sent Deputy Commissioner of Police Pannat to the scene to explain to the Japanese military police that since the police officers had arrived at the scene first, they had priority. The two sides were deadlocked, and Pannat immediately telephoned the Assistant Commissioner of Police Robertson for instructions on whether to hand over the association, but permission was not granted. He then informed the Japanese military police and continued the conversation.</p>
<p>Lengthy Talks, Both Sides Left</p>
<p>After more than half an hour, Major Hayashi said that he mistakenly believed that taking over the association would not encounter opposition. Hayashi then asked if he obtained the keys to the association and returned, would he be allowed to take over? However, Pannat ordered two Western detectives and several Chinese police officers to remain and guard the association. Even if the Japanese military police returned with the keys, they would not be allowed to occupy the association unless accompanied by personnel from the Political Section. The Japanese military police and Chinese and the police representatives talked for one hour and fifteen minutes but were still unsuccessful and left.</p>

<p>The wharf workers of the Ewo Cotton Mill at 1056 Yangshupu Road went on strike demanding improved treatment. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, a large number of workers clashed and fought with police officers, and many police officers and workers were injured. These events have been recorded in this newspaper. It has been learned that as a result of the fighting, Davis, a Western employee of the factory, was also injured. The workers who were arrested on the spot by the police were Kong Heshou, Hu Atu, Zhang Shikang, Wang Chunyou, Hu Huide, Hu Deyou, Yan Guolin, Wang Xiangli, Yan Futian, Chen Caiji, Cheng Yanguan, Zhang Yizhen, Lou Ar Er, Cai Qinghuo, Cai Qinglong, Wang Shaoyun, Yan Shaodi, Yan Haiqing, Li Huajun, Lu Caiyuan, Yan Cunxin, Dong Baoyou, Hu Chunhuo, Zhang Peiduo, Wang Liangzhong, Cen Afu, Zhang Yingtai, Wang Liangzao, Jiang Zaoming, Yu Wenquan, Sun Deguang, and thirty-one others.

Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested a postponement of the interrogation because the first sixteen defendants were unable to attend court due to injuries in the hospital. After questioning by Judge Liu Yugui, the judge ordered them to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Telegram Urging the CCP to Send Representatives to the Soviet Union, Reaffirming Guarantees of Aid to China, Student Federation Sends Telegram to the Highest CCP Officials <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Student Federation telegraphed the highest CCP officials, Yan'an. Addressed to the esteemed CCP's highest officials, we are shocked by the Soviet-Japanese diplomatic representatives' signing of the Neutrality Pact in Moscow, declaring the so-called "People's Republic of Outer Mongolia" and the "Empire of Manchuria" to have territorial integrity and inviolability, and guaranteeing each other's security. This agreement, which harms our country's territory and administration, cannot be recognized by our people. It is inconsistent with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924 and the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1937. Today, the Soviet Union seeks compromise with Japan, even at the expense of Sino-Soviet friendship. The news is astonishing. The Soviet Union, as the initiator of the international anti-aggression front and championing sympathy for the revolutionary movements of small and weak nations, has now disregarded trust and faith, colluding with the aggressor and openly insulting our country's sovereignty. Its intentions are incomprehensible. Regardless of the Soviet government's motives, whether to divide the Axis or drive Japan south, the result will inevitably be broken promises and self-serving opportunism. The CCP's daily activities in the country are obedient to the Soviet Union, and all propaganda is based on the Soviet line. The CCP's service to the Soviet Union has not been ineffective. But CCP members are all citizens of the Republic of China, and it is believed that this event is also the greatest regret. We have always admired your spirit of opposing "compromise" and "surrender" and have always been at the forefront. We dare to telegraph you to convene an emergency meeting immediately, send representatives to Moscow, and make sincere requests to ensure careful consideration of your actions and reaffirm concrete guarantees of aid to us. Know that making any agreement with a country that has no faith will inevitably lead to betrayal and self-destruction. We eagerly await your response. The Shanghai Student Federation bows.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Rice Market Yesterday Received Instruction to Implement Standard Rice Prices, Based on the Previous Day's Closing Prices as the Standard, Which is a Temporary Measure to Restrict Rice Prices <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Within the past three to five days, the average price of rice per dan (unit of weight) has been inflated by about ten yuan. The Public Concession's Municipal Council, therefore, specifically instructed the Rice Market Management Committee to stipulate standard selling prices for domestic and foreign rice, in order to stabilize the market situation. Upon receiving the instruction, the market issued Public Notice No. 188 yesterday morning. The original text is copied as follows: "We have just received an instruction from the Municipal Council that the market price of rice managed by this market should be based on the closing price of yesterday (the 16th) as the standard. From today onwards, anyone who exceeds this standard without authorization will be severely punished without leniency. This is a special announcement for all to know and strictly abide by. This notice."</p>
<p>Rice Price Standards</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Rice Market Management Committee that the closing prices for domestic and foreign rice on the market on the 16th were as follows: (1) Domestic Rice: White粳 128.5 yuan, Early and Late Rice 118.5 yuan, Liyang White 122 yuan, Wuhu Sharp 116 yuan; (2) Foreign Rice: Saigon No. 1 124 yuan, Saigon No. 2 120 yuan, Siamese No. 1 123 yuan, Mindang 123 yuan, Fire Twisted 122 yuan, Small Pattern 120 yuan (Yinghua Company 146 yuan), 礱 Rice 115 yuan, Hong Kong Glutinous Rice 114 yuan, Saigon Broken Rice 99 yuan (Yinghua Company 117 yuan). The above prices are calculated based on 160 market catties (equal to one dan).</p>
<p>Secret Investigation by Detectives</p>
<p>The authorities of both concessions have each dispatched several detectives daily to the rice market to monitor rice merchants' transactions. They have apprehended speculative rice merchants several times and dealt with them according to the law. Previously, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee voluntarily disbanded, which led to the de facto cancellation of the price limits on fifteen types of foreign rice, making secret investigation work impossible to carry out. Now that the authorities have instructed the setting of price limits for domestic and foreign rice, in addition to resuming secret investigation work, and in order to expand operations, the Central Detective Office of the Public Concession has specifically assigned several detectives under Mao Guobao to be stationed at important locations in the rice market to investigate the operations of rice merchants. Once discovered, they will be arrested and severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>Hoarding and Firmly Stockpiling</p>
<p>After the rice market opened yesterday morning, the authorities had taken measures to set price limits for domestic and foreign rice, and those holding goods found it inconvenient to raise rice prices. Therefore, the price of domestic and foreign rice was relatively stable yesterday morning, and transactions were made according to the limits. However, in general, large holders of goods, although not raising market prices, are firmly stockpiling and unwilling to easily release their holdings, waiting for favorable prices to sell, which has a significant impact on the rice market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Afternoon Black Market</p>
<p>The afternoon rice trade has a considerable impact on the rice market. Because it is impossible to raise the price of rice sold in the morning, and there is fear of being discovered and prosecuted by detectives stationed in the market, rice is sold secretly in the afternoon at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII, reaping illegal profits. According to sources, the concession authorities, considering that the afternoon rice trade is seriously detrimental to the overall food supply of Shanghai, are actively seeking ways to ban the afternoon rice trade, so as to standardize the transaction prices of domestic and foreign rice.</p>
<p>Price Limits on Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>After the rice price is limited, the commission charged by the rice industry should not exceed five jiao per shi (unit of capacity). The retail price of rice shops should not exceed one yuan and five jiao per shi. The selling prices of miscellaneous grains are also limited to the closing prices of the 16th as the standard: (1) Flower-Bird Flour, 30 yuan and 5 jiao and a half per bag; (2) Wheat, 45 yuan per dan; (3) Dutch Corn, 33 yuan and 6 jiao. It is also learned that the Miscellaneous Grains Association has notified all members to hold a meeting at the association's location at 3:00 PM today to discuss market operating methods.</p>

They were taken to the French police station. Since the Japanese side did not provide evidence of their crimes, the police station temporarily detained them for investigation. However, it is said that Wang and his wife were arrested because the Japanese side suspected them of being involved in intelligence work. It is also said that Wang is the owner of a certain nail factory.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Assault Incident at the Residence of Criminal Court President Feng Shide; Patrol Officers Stationed There Discovered and Took Precautions; Two Bombs Were Thrown, One Chinese Constable Slightly Injured <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Around 12:00 AM on the 13th of this month, a number of thugs broke into No. 48, Lane 445, Route Metrahest, attempting to kidnap Xiang Zhejiong, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai First Special District Court, without success, but they robbed two Chinese constables of two rows of bullets from their pistols. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, another bombing attack occurred in front of the residence of Feng Shide, the Criminal Court President of the Special First Court on Route Annam. The detectives stationed by the police department at that time engaged in a fight with the thugs, resulting in one Chinese constable being injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guards Stationed at the Judge's Residence</p>
<p>Feng Shide, courtesy name Mingjiu, from Xuzhou, is the current Criminal Court President of the First Special District Court. His Shanghai residence is at No. 30, Cihou North Lane, Route Annam. Previously, due to repeated attacks on court personnel, the Public Concession Police Department, in order to protect the safety of all judges, assigned detectives to protect the residences of the judges. Feng's residence was also guarded by three Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, No. 303, No. 3139, and No. 1759, up to the present.</p>
<p>Car Arrives Quietly in the Deep Night</p>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, due to martial law, there were no people on the roads in the deep of night. Suddenly, a black private car with license plate number 2735 stopped abruptly at the entrance of Cihou Lane. Several men in Western suits jumped out of the car, but did not enter the lane. They were seen whispering to each other at the entrance of the lane by Constable No. 1062, the lane guard, who suspected them because they were neither residents of the lane nor did they look like they were visiting someone at night. He immediately reported to the Chinese constables guarding Feng's residence.</p>
<p>Two Bombs Thrown in the Face; Both Explode</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the three Chinese constables, along with the lane guard, formed a team and went out with their guns raised, intending to question them. Unexpectedly, the men had already entered the lane. When the Western-suited men saw the constables, they knew they had been exposed. The leader reached into his pocket and took out two hand grenades, throwing them directly at the constables. There was a loud bang, and shrapnel flew everywhere. However, the constables were far away and were not hit by the explosion. They opened fire, but the Western-suited thugs also fired back and fled out of the lane, jumping into the car and escaping without a trace.</p>
<p>Shrapnel Shatters Plaster, Injures Chinese Constable</p>
<p>After the police department was notified, it urgently dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene in police cars and searched the surrounding area. It was found that the brick walls and cement in the lane were cracked by the explosion of the bombs, and the shrapnel had injured the face and cheeks of Chinese Constable No. 31129. The injured constable was taken to the hospital, but his injuries were not serious. After being bandaged, he left the hospital. It is also learned that the police authorities are paying close attention to the case and are conducting a strict investigation. It is said that the license plate number of the car may be fake, because it is known that car number 2735 is a small car, while the car used by the thugs was a large car. Therefore, it can be concluded that the car's license plate was forged.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that Jack La Rue, a US citizen once known as the "King of Slot Machines," is now being returned to the United States for imprisonment. Before his arrest, La Rue, using the alias John Baker, was hiding in a house in Hongkou. The landlord, Mrs. Suxina (an unrecognized Brazilian national), is suspected of harboring a criminal. The First Court issued a summons today (the 17th), ordering her to appear in court tomorrow morning (the 18th) for trial. At that time, the Public Concession Police Department will formally prosecute her. If the woman fails to appear in court tomorrow morning, the First Court will issue an arrest warrant. According to the authorities, when the Police Department and US officials arrested Jack La Rue, the woman said that she little knew that Jack was hiding in her house, only that the arrested person was named "Frank."</p>

<p>Zhu Changhai, 36 years old, is from northern Jiangsu Province and is currently the director of the printing department of the China Press. He usually lives in the newspaper office and rarely goes out. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, he went out on an errand when a man suddenly emerged from the roadside and fired a shot at his back. The bullet entered his back, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. When the Chinese constables heard the sound and arrived, the assailant had already fled without a trace. They immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene for investigation. A rescue vehicle was summoned and the injured person was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His injuries were serious. After doctors operated and removed the bullet, his condition did not improve. It is said that his life may be in danger. It is reported that at around 10:00 PM last night, his family transferred Zhu Changhai to another hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Food: Another New Price Limit; Let's See if Old Tricks and Corrupt Practices Will Occur <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>After the soaring prices of foreign rice in recent times, the concession authorities, considering that this situation is not a blessing for the people's food supply, are urgently seeking ways to curb it. Yesterday, the market announced the re-implementation of price limits based on the closing prices of the previous day. The price for Saigon No. 1 was set at 124 yuan, No. 2 at 120 yuan, Siamese No. 1, Mindang, and Fire Twisted at 123 yuan, Small Twisted at 120 yuan, Tokyo 礱 Sharp at 115 yuan, and Broken Sharp Pill at 109 yuan, causing both buyers and sellers to be cautious and not dare to manipulate prices at will. Transactions are being made according to the limits. However, the sales side is still not affected by the price limits. Not only are speculators continuing to collect, but also new hoarding retailers are unusually active, absorbing each other. Therefore, although the early market situation was once soft, the afternoon market recovered strongly, with only purchases and no sales, ultimately closing firmly. The prices are all in line with the limited range, which is difficult to change after hitting the wall. I believe it will continue to rise straight to the sky. However, especially high-quality goods have not been sampled. The transactions on the market are all high-quality goods in the general market. Although they were sold at the limited price yesterday, there is deep concern that they will soon be sold as high-quality goods. There is no market for Yinghua Company's Saigon, Small Pattern at 146 yuan, and Broken Rice at 117 yuan, with transactions of over a thousand tons. There are now less than 10,000 bags of rice because only local customers are handling them slightly. The general external large accounts have not yet dared to try immediately.</p>
<p>Although there is not much market stock of thick 粳 and glutinous rice, it was also restricted by the price limits yesterday, causing the goods owners to want to push up prices but were not allowed by the facts. At the same time, local shops and customer stockpiles took advantage of this to conduct business smoothly, and the sales side felt lonely. The selling prices all followed the specified limits, with Changbang Qing Special粳 opening at 128.5 yuan, High粳 at 126 yuan, Kunshan Special粳 at 125 yuan, and 秔至 at 120 yuan. Qingjiao 斛见 Thin Rice was at 118.3 yuan to 117 yuan, Hong Kong Special Yuan glutinous rice at 114 yuan, 秔至 at 110 yuan, and Glutinous 菉 at 104 yuan to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Flour Market Loosens Secretly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Due to the rapid increase in rice and oil prices, and the Municipal Council's crackdown on speculation and monopolies, the miscellaneous grain market has virtually stagnated. However, there are reportedly 1,000 bags of newly arrived Yellow Bull brand 坎 flour being distributed directly to customers outside the market at a price of 28 yuan and 9 jiao. They were all handled by mainland agents. However, under the authorities' crackdown on speculation, retail accounts are quite eager to sell 金龙 brand 坎 flour, and the price has secretly loosened from 28 yuan and 9 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. Flower-Bird brand Australian flour, with only a small amount of inventory, still requires 30 yuan and 5 jiao. It is said that later batches of 坎 flour are arriving continuously, but sales by North and South customers have already stopped. Chinese factories are supplying plain-priced flour as usual. Therefore, the market prospect may be difficult to view optimistically for a while.</p>
<p>Wheat is truly idle. Amidst the strong demand in the flour market, goods owners are all holding on, so the market supply is extremely limited. There is also no spot goods available for collection at Japanese factory outlets.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Price Limits Implemented for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil cakes market, due to the sudden indication from the authorities of the two concessions that all commodity prices must not exceed the prices opened on the 16th, the industry association announced to the market, advising its members to strictly abide by and implement the price limits. Therefore, there were only sporadic transactions in the market yesterday (10 pieces and 100 cans of live oil, 300 bags of soybeans, 3 vehicles of red grain, 200 bags and 50 tons of corn, and 6,3400 pieces of soybean cake were transacted), and market prices changed little. However, although the overall situation is suppressed, people's hearts are enthusiastic, and the flames of speculative desire are high, which may inevitably lead to compliance in name only and doing dark market transactions.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw a stable HSBC listing. Secret markets for sterling and US dollars were chaotic, first tightening and then slightly rebounding. An unfortunate incident involving a Bank of China employee led to the closure of the "Four Banks," leaving speculative traders without supply from banks, causing sterling to rise to 3 shillings and 1.875 pence and US dollars to 5.1875 yuan.

US dollars could be settled at 5.25 yuan at one point, and sterling also rebounded slightly. However, the market stabilized by noon and was even more stable in the afternoon, with fewer transactions.

Chinese merchants sold May US dollars at 5.21875 yuan and 1.875 yuan, and sterling also softened to 3 shillings and 1.875 pence at 9:15 AM. After a rumor that the Bank of China would open as usual, the speculative rush subsided, and the market hardened.

<p>Yesterday, the gold market's 烚赤 black market saw a frenzied short squeeze due to the temporary closure of the "Four Banks" in the city and the sudden tightening of foreign exchange. Market prices jumped and rose sharply, opening at a high price of 6,700 yuan, with a highest price of 6,701 yuan. This triggered profit-taking from long positions, and after hearing that foreign exchange was being maintained by Chinese, British, and American banks, three gold shops and two foreign exchange shops began to sell, leading to a 100 yuan pullback, falling to 6,605 yuan at one point. Near noon, securities firms bought in again, causing prices to rise again.

<p>The bond black market yesterday was trending fluctuating and uncertain when an unexpected incident occurred in this city, causing the "Four Banks" to be unable to respond to the market as usual. Rumors spread for a while, mostly speculative and unfounded, causing unease in people's hearts. Selling pressure was stronger in the market, and major longs temporarily withdrew. Therefore, transactions were also sluggish. The environment was subject to unexpected events that were difficult to predict, causing the bond market to be unable to rise temporarily. In the morning market, the United Union had sell orders, and Class C bonds were down 2 jiao. Although Tong Kang and Xie Kang bought in, the selling pressure was strong. Class C bonds opened at 5 yuan and 5 jiao, falling to 5 yuan and 1 jiao at one point. Later, the price slowly rose to 5 jiao due to retail accounts covering short positions. Although the market situation was weak, it was still stable. In the afternoon, United Interests had more sell orders, and there were also scattered retail sell orders. The market price weakened again and fell back uniformly, resulting in a pullback of 4 jiao to 7 jiao. The total volume of transactions was only about 1 million yuan.

<h3 id="e77">Cotton Yarn: Active Speculation, Soaring Yarn Prices <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which was stable the previous day, rose again yesterday. This was due to positive sentiment, uniformly upward expectations, high prices for all goods, rising raw material prices, and numerous rumors, all of which were beneficial to long positions. The standard gold price rose sharply, which led to a surge in speculative buying. As for actual sales, demand from Hong Kong dealers remained strong, and cloth consumption was robust with high selling prices exceeding yarn prices, thus buyers became more active. Under this competitive buying, Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn prices naturally soared, breaking through the 500 yuan mark. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,533 yuan, and the low price was 1,507 yuan. In the early afternoon, it traded at 1,528 yuan, rising to 537 yuan. Subsequently, as long positions were closed, it pulled back slightly to 1,521 yuan and then rose again to 1,527 yuan. The final price was 1,520 yuan, but at 5:30 PM, someone wanted to buy at 1,524 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, continuing the strong rising momentum from the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,500 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers flocked in, and the market was filled with buying voices, immediately rising to 1,527 yuan. It was then heard that the standard gold price had soared, and buying became even more active, reaching 1,533 yuan again. Subsequently, as profitable players and large accounts sold together, supply eased slightly, and the market sentiment weakened, pulling back to 1,507 yuan. However, securities firms and small companies were uniformly optimistic, and buyers were very strong, rising again to 1,520 yuan. The price remained stable at this level for a long time. By the time of closing, it was heard that gold prices were high, and the price rose again to 1,529 yuan. The closing price pulled back slightly to 1,524 yuan. Statistics for transactions in the half-day totalled 8,500 bales. The amount purchased by each dealer is listed on the left: Hong Kong 1,000, Đồng Hành 7,000. Total: 8,500.</p>

<p>Spot cotton prices continue to rise, and the upward trend is intensifying. This is because the situation in the Pacific is becoming critical, allowing those holding goods to demand higher prices. At the same time, Chinese merchants are actively purchasing cotton for their mills, further bolstering confidence. As a result, 20-count raw cotton is increasing by more than ten yuan. The rise in raw cotton prices for 42-count fine yarn is even more pronounced. However, the supply of Indian cotton is abundant, and the favorable environment has not been affected in the slightest. Yesterday, a total of 8,421 bales were traded, with prices rising by 3.5 yuan. The opening prices for various spot cotton grades are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Another report: Cotton trading in Shanghai remains lively and active. On the one hand, the spot yarn market is doing well, and people are optimistic about future prices. On the other hand, Shanghai's inventory is quite low, and there is concern that overseas procurement may be disrupted. Therefore, traders have been actively competing to buy Indian and Brazilian cotton, with each exceeding 1,000 bales. Furthermore, mills are naturally purchasing cotton continuously to replenish their raw cotton supply. Yesterday, Wing On Company purchased over a thousand bales of Indian cotton. Consequently, the market has risen sharply and entered a state of fierce competition.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to speculative selling but later rebounded due to short covering and strong support from Wall Street. As a result, the closing price rose or fell by one point per pound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>There is no market report for Indian cotton. It is predicted that the opening price today will increase slightly by one rupee.</p>

<p>Mill Cloth: Yesterday's market started flat but then rose as some traders took profits amid sluggish sales. As a result, the opening bids for various cloths in the morning fluctuated only slightly. However, in the afternoon, traders and garden owners resumed buying, causing market prices to surge. As a result, fine cloth and twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt, and coarse cloth rose by about 9 jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by 5 jiao in some cases. Over 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth,府绸(fǔchóu), and bleached cloth were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong traders dealt in over 300 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou traders handled over 100 pieces of colored cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Nanyang traders handled over one hundred pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to continuous strong buying by both internal and external traders for hoarding, prices of all goods rose uniformly. Among white goods, mid-range fine twill experienced a sharp increase of about one yuan per bolt due to strong customer demand. Fine cloth rose by 6-7 jiao. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head brand現棧單(xiànzhàndān) in the afternoon was 52.6 yuan. Colored cloth君子嗶嘰(jūnzǐ bìjī) continued to be sought after by hoarders, becoming increasingly scarce, and rose sharply to 1.5825 yuan.</p>

<p>Kaiping Coal: Due to scattered arrivals of Kaiping bituminous coal in recent days and restrictions on supplies from the production area, the sales offices in this city are only supplying a limited amount to old customers, and refusing new customers altogether. As a result, there is very little outflow from traders, and the market is controlled by hoarders. In the private market yesterday, Kaiping lump coal was priced at 370 yuan per ton, and No. 2 fines at 320 yuan. Traders delivered from their warehouses to customers, with an additional handling fee.</p>

<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item titled "Tong De Li Coal Hoarded and Not Sold." We have now received a letter from Bingxing Coal Company, the manager of the coal, explaining the situation and requesting a correction. We are attaching the original letter below:</p>
<p>To the Editor of Commercial News, Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We have just seen a news item in the "Coal" section of your newspaper today, titled "Tong De Li Coal Hoarded and Not Sold." Although the article did not explicitly name our company, we are the sole distributors of Tong De Li Coal, so we must respond. Our company has always sold Tong De Li Coal as soon as it arrives, and we have never hoarded it. It is not that we are unaware that hoarding can lead to profiteering, but in these extraordinary times, we recognize the need to sacrifice the individual for the greater good. This is what people on this island should do, so there's no need to ask others to understand. However, the public only knows that coal merchants can hoard coal, but they don't understand the difference between hoarders and coal merchants. Our company simply does not have enough coal to satisfy the unlimited demand from customers. Therefore, some people have taken advantage of this situation, spreading false rumors and accusations to vent their personal grievances. We admire your newspaper for upholding justice and maintaining social order. However, we believe that the publication of this news may please the accuser, but it makes the accused feel that there is no right or wrong in the world. Therefore, we respectfully request that you investigate the accuser's motives and determine whether the accusation is justified. We would be very grateful if you would grant us a correction. Respectfully, Bingxing Coal Company.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Recently, coal prices have risen sharply, greatly impacting users, and even making it impossible to purchase. Those who are unaware of the situation may assume that coal businesses are hoarding and profiteering, disregarding the hardships of the public. Having read the letter, we now understand the underlying reasons. The statement "sacrifice the individual for the greater good" is commendable, and we deeply feel that there is no right or wrong in the world, and cannot help but sigh. However, the fact remains that a large quantity of coal has been absorbed by customers, and genuine users are still unable to receive the benefits. Although this cannot be entirely blamed on the company, it is inconsistent with the company's spirit of upholding the greater good. If the company could stop supplying customers and instead supply its coal to direct consumers as much as possible, while still limiting their purchase quantity, up to one ton or as little as a quarter of a ton, and register each purchase to understand the usage time, in order to prevent disguised purchases for hoarding, then the company's sincere effort to uphold the greater good would be clear to the world, and no one could slander it.</p>

Yesterday, all the students of the school sent a letter to the school authorities, requesting early mediation to avoid wasting their studies. As for the mediation, the school entrusted Director Tian of the main school and Director Xu of the branch school to handle it. The teachers were represented by Dai Lizhi. After several contacts, the results were quite satisfactory. At 9 pm last night, the teachers sent additional representatives, including Ji Yan and others, to discuss with the school again.

<h3 id="e90">How to Study Chemistry (II) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ruiping</p>
<p>3. Research on Chemistry</p>
<p>We already know the importance and necessity of chemistry research. However, people often hesitate because of its difficulty or stop halfway, resulting in a failure to achieve success. Now, based on my experience in chemistry research and chemistry teaching, I will briefly discuss the methods of research. When I teach, I often ask students which subject they are most interested in, and they always say, "Chemistry." When asked which subject they find the most difficult, they also say, "Chemistry." When asked why, they say that studying chemistry is like watching magic, so it is very interesting, but there are countless changes, making it difficult to remember, so it is the most difficult. Reading chemistry is like watching magic, its basic concept is already wrong, how can it not be difficult to read? You need to know that when watching magic, "eyes" in an instant hen turns into a duck, this is false, to understand, to learn only need to be familiar with the operation, reading chemistry to know that white sugar mixed with potassium chlorate plus concentrated sulfuric acid will catch fire, this is true to understand the true principle of what is not easy, because chemistry for the interpretation of natural phenomena and the description of scientific theory, are based on facts and strict organization, is definitely not comparable to learning magic, so the researcher of chemistry, must have the prerequisite conditions, what is the condition, please look carefully at it,</p>
<p>(1) Strong Interest Regardless of doing things or studying, to obtain satisfactory results, we must first be interested in this matter before we can, and the same is true for studying chemistry. How can we arouse interest in studying chemistry?</p>
<p>A. Read more general youths after reading ×× The Legend of the Chivalrous Man, they went to Mount Emei one after another to seek immortals and visit Taoists. On the one hand, they were motivated by their curiosity, and on the other hand, youths are rich in imitation. If this type of book is changed to the biography of famous chemists or the history of success of chemists, I predict that it will definitely arouse the interest of youths and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>B. Observe more. We should recognize that chemistry research must be closely related to our actual life. Everywhere, we should start with the things we come into contact with in daily life and make deep observations. For example, the fried oil fritters we see on both sides of the road when walking have chemical factors. Baking biscuits also has a chemical effect. In addition, lacquers and paints all have chemical principles. In short, if we can pay attention to observation everywhere and study them, we will naturally develop a strong interest in chemistry research.</p>
<p>C. Experiment more. Cramming-style reading of chemistry cannot arouse the interest in reading chemistry. If we start from experiments and get a clear understanding of many theories and phenomena, we can also arouse the interest of readers.</p>
<p>D. Visit more. As the saying goes, seeing is believing. If you are researching larger chemical problems, which cannot be solved in the laboratory, you should visit in many ways. Once you gain something, you will definitely increase your interest a lot.</p>

<h3 id="e92">That's Just a Story <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Gu</p>
<p>What is called a story, perhaps it is a thing of the past, call it a story; is it just that we will repeat the occurrence into a "new thing"? Then I can hardly determine. Let's first tell a foreign story below:</p>
<p>In the summer of 1788, the whole of France was in famine, and the price of grain was rising day by day, and the peasants and urban poor could not get food. The hungry "masses" rose up and "looted" grain treasuries and flour shops, and "attacked speculative merchants." The workers and coolies of Paris rioted, "destroying factories and factory owners' residences," and the whole city was in turmoil, and the people rose up in revolt...</p>
<p>This is a story that is more than 150 years away from now. The "speculative merchants" of the isolated island can avoid worry, and the "factories" and "factory owners' residences" will not be affected and destroyed, and, and that is a "fantasy", you can rest assured!</p>
<p>But, the summer of 1941 is approaching, that is, we become "that" Paris new things. Judging from the current market situation, even the storyteller can hardly determine...</p>
<h3 id="e93">The "Greater Self" View of Life <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Bo</p>
<p>Returned after seeing "Life is But a Dream"</p>
<p>"Life is But a Dream" is said to be a famous play, which had a very high evaluation in the American film world. Now this play has been translated into Chinese. Generally speaking, it is indeed a light, lively and interesting script.</p>
<p>In the play, two different families are described: one is a family full of the joy of family, and each member of the family has their different hobbies, - not hobbies, but indulgently, - no, it should be freely working hard at it, such as those who like to write, those who like to make chemical firecrackers, those who like to study Peking Opera, and even those who like to collect stamps, etc. In short, there is absolutely no restraint or oppression in this family according to the free will, only full of happy work, and the warm and clear atmosphere of spring.</p>
<p>However, the situation of another family being described is different. What the family thinks and does all day long is the work of making money. Therefore, the whole family shows restraint, dullness, and lifelessness. However, the younger generation is not willing to submit to this for a long time. After feeling the propaganda of the former family, the younger generation in two different family environments, - but with a common will, finally broke through the obstacles and combined, and at the same time, even the stubborn old generation turned around and changed the goal of life. For "fame" and "profit", a lifetime of hard work is like an empty thought like a "dream"! What is mainly told here is that the "glory, wealth and riches" you are pursuing are all fleeting clouds, even if you achieve your goal. But being able to enjoy the leisurely and transcendent joy of self-sufficiency in life is the true happiness of life.</p>
<p>We look at everything at this time and place, like mud mayflies in the vast sea. Most of the creatures are running and scurrying for life, "fame" and "profit", and even causing the turmoil in the market at this time and the famine among the civilians. How much are those who are called "glory, wealth and riches" loved and pursued by people today? It seems that they can abandon all the necessities (recognized as necessities), but they cannot give up the pursuit of "glory, wealth and riches" for a day. Then, the performance of this "Life is But a Dream" has its realistic warning significance, let the obsessives of "wealth and glory" wake up for a moment, "Life is a dream", why bother so much?</p>
<p>However, what I think is regrettable is the non-positive nature shown to us by this play! Because according to what I have seen and felt, in addition to regarding "wealth and glory" as fleeting clouds, it is enough to seek the comfortable, free and joyful pleasure in the family and life; in fact, the acquisition of this peaceful pleasure is obviously too selfish and too humble. I think that at least when our living society is drumming with an unprecedented situation today, it is very inappropriate and very inappropriate for the psychology of enjoying pleasure and pursuing comfort and self-satisfaction to be popularized in the minds of the general public!</p>
<p>In the "View of a Striving Life" published continuously in this newspaper, there is a paragraph saying: "...Therefore, the reason why a person is a person is completely dependent on the society, and striving for the society is respecting the greater self, and it is also the inalienable duty of mankind!" This thoroughly explains what kind of concept of life we need to establish at this time and place!</p>
<p>We need to establish a "greater self" view of life!</p>

<h3 id="e95">A Discussion on the Jinshan Mouth Shipwreck Tragedy <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ya</p>
<p>On the morning of the ninth of this month, a shipwreck tragedy occurred at Jinshan Mouth in Hangzhou Bay. More than two hundred passengers were aboard, and only forty or so survived. The cause of such a tragic disaster is naturally the ship owner's and others' negligence of life due to greed for wealth. However, the passengers' lack of composure in responding to the emergency and the lack of unity in working together to avert the crisis are also among the reasons for this terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>According to reports, when the ship reached the sea off Jinshan Mouth, the wind and waves were fierce, and the ship was heavily loaded. The ship owner knew that danger was imminent and steered the ship towards the mudflats of Jinshan Mouth, but it was already impossible to save it, and the ship broke apart. Before it broke, the ship owner shouted loudly, ordering the passengers to disembark onto the beach, which was the right thing to do. However, if these two hundred or so people could have united and found a way to leave the ship, so many lives would certainly not have been lost. When leaving the ship, the first thing to do is to remain calm and not rush ahead of each other. After standing on the beach, everyone should join hands and form a human chain. Children should be carried on the backs of strong adults. This would make it difficult to be washed away by the waves, and even if someone was knocked down, they could be easily rescued, so there would be no fear for their lives. The more than forty people who went in the wrong direction and lost their lives at sea could also have been saved. After standing firm, observe the rising and falling of the tide. If the tide is rising, one should try to quickly go ashore. If the tide is receding, it may be best for everyone to stand still and wait for the tide to ebb a little before walking, or move forward slowly. Even if it takes until dawn to walk, it doesn't matter. Now, you go east, and I go west, each trying to escape, but in the end, no one can escape death.</p>
<p>These are times of great difficulty, and this shipwreck tragedy is a lesson for us.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Contradiction Between "Poor" and "Rich" <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>The Basic Factors of "Robbing" and "Hoarding"</p>
<p>"Man dies for wealth, birds die for food."</p>
<p>This has been the "way of life" since ancient times, and many people have spent their lives "struggling" under this "great" "goal," only to accumulate vast wealth and become bloated millionaires. Perhaps, once they close their eyes, they will "show filial piety" to their descendants. The so-called name of "filial" "son" probably originates from this. It seems that if parents don't work hard to accumulate some inheritance, they are letting their children down. This idea is held by many of our ancestors, no, even those living in the eleventh decade of the twentieth century still harbor this "great" "plan" and "idea." They truly deserve to be called "models" of parents.</p>
<p>This is one type of person who is desperate for money.</p>
<p>There is also another type who "live from hand to mouth," willing to do anything as long as there is money. They disregard all baseness and shame, believing that money is omnipotent. However, these people do not necessarily want to leave behind any inheritance, seeking only their own comfort, wealth, honor, and enjoyment.</p>
<p>This is another type of person who is desperate for money.</p>
<p>However, living is the most basic need of every human being, the spirit of all things, and in today's society where money is still needed, another type of person who needs money to live emerges.</p>
<p>However, strangely enough, money seems to be like the tide. Those who have money get more and more money, and they become happier, more powerful, and fatter. Those who are poor and miserable become poorer and poorer, more and more miserable, and more and more emaciated! Thus, two sides of society are created today.</p>
<p>At the same time, social unrest arises from the struggle between the "poor" and the "rich," and the conflict between "suffering" and "pleasure."</p>
<p>You want money, and I want money, so everyone racks their brains to come up with all kinds of despicable, shameless, insidious, and malicious methods, thus creating the strange development of today!</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, Mr. Weiyang's article "The Cause and Effect of 'Robbing' and 'Nationalization'" pointed out that "robbing" is caused by "nationalization." I further say that the basic contradiction of this social phenomenon arises from the division between "poor" and "rich." I think no one will object to this statement!</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that we should see into the bone marrow. We must use scientific methods to extract the pus growing in the bone marrow and thoroughly eliminate the rotten bacteria inside.</p>

<p>(7) A Cross Scratched on His Face</p>
<p>It was dusk. The cotton-like white clouds in the sky had gradually turned grayish-brown. The fiery sun had also embarked on its final journey half an hour ago, with less than a quarter of its body remaining above the horizon, emitting some dark red light from the northwest, making it impossible for the heat in the air to decrease for a while.</p>
<p>In a small tavern near the tram tracks, two men in short clothes were drinking and talking, taking advantage of the remaining light of the sunset.</p>
<p>"Damn it! It's this one thing I can't figure out." A man with a face so thin that it was all skin and bones, his eyes wide open in a triangular shape, said, "You think our Commander has played with a lot of women over the past ten years, and none of them has ever given birth to a single egg. How is it that this one here can give him a son? If this woman's belly wasn't made big by Qiu Haitang, I, Ji Zhaoxiong, can cut off my head right away! I just can't figure out what tricks that kid used, that the child born doesn't resemble him at all, but it also doesn't resemble our Commander! To be honest, it doesn't even resemble the woman. It's probably some kind of hybrid they swapped out."</p>
<p>Sitting across from him was a young man with an open front, bare legs, and bare feet. A cigarette butt was stuck diagonally behind his ear. His face and body fully revealed an air of hooliganism. He took a sip of white liquor and put down his glass.</p>
<p>"Maybe you misjudged it."</p>
<p>"Only a bastard would misjudge it!" Ji Zhaoxiong had obviously drunk more wine than his specially invited guest, so he spoke more frankly than usual. "If he hadn't had an affair with someone else's concubine, what kind of relationship would I, Ji Zhaoxiong, have with him that he would obediently lend me one hundred and fifty [dollars]?"</p>
<p>Because it was still early, the people who usually drank at night hadn't arrived yet. Besides the two of them, there was only an old man from the countryside in the tavern.</p>
<p>"Besides, his not singing opera and constantly coming to Tianjin is a big loophole!" The young man nodded and said, "But, Ji Lao Wu, you're not generous enough! You only told me today that you got so much money from him. The past few times we were your errand boys, tracking him down everywhere, you always gave us one or two yuan of foreign money each time. We never even saw a five-yuan transportation ticket, you say..." (84)</p>

<h3 id="e98">My Views on "Playing the Flower Drum" <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Kui</p>
<p>Yesterday, in this journal, Mr. Qian Naijiang's article about "Playing the Flower Drum" stated, "Originally, it embodied revolutionary significance in the songs of flower drum women during the Ming Dynasty, spreading propaganda in the countryside and becoming a latent force among the people, which helped Hongwu drive out the Yuan Tartars, and its contribution was not small. But now, what is performed on stage is a flower drum woman, a heroic woman, transformed into a disguised prostitute." I sought guidance from Mr. Zhang Guyu on this matter, and according to Mr. Zhang's account, it differed greatly from Mr. Qian's article. Mr. Zhang said: "This play was written by Yuan loyalists in the early Ming Dynasty. Although it is listed among Yuan dramas, the time it was written was actually after the late Yuan Dynasty. A group of Yuan Dynasty loyalists, unable to restore their country, wrote this play and instructed actors to perform it in various places, all to disturb the hearts of the people. Looking at a Fengyang song, 'Beat the drums tightly, knock the gongs slowly, you old folks listen to me sing the rice planting song, I don't sing any other songs, listen to me sing the Fengyang song. Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang is a good place, but since Emperor Zhu came out, there have been nine years of famine in ten years. Wealthy families sell their fields, and poor families sell their children. I have no children to sell, so I carry the flower drum on my back and walk in all directions,' it can be proved that it is a propaganda play against the Ming Dynasty. Emperor Zhu is Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. It means that since Zhu Yuanzhang was born, there have been nine years of famine in ten years, the rich have become poor, and the strong have scattered in all directions. The Kunqu opera version is adapted from Yuan dramas, simply called 'Flower Drum.' Because Kunqu opera is a leisure activity for scholars and officials after tea and wine, the vulgar parts have been changed to be very refined, thus losing the true flavor, unlike the Fengyang woman selling songs on the street, it is like a little maid from the Yuanwai's mansion putting on a play. Peking opera follows this example, turning the flower drum woman into a young girl, not like a man's wife, but like a man's daughter. Also, because small plays all add the word 'Playing,' such as 'Playing Cherries,' 'Playing the City God,' 'Playing the Kitchen God,' 'Playing the Carrying Pole,' therefore 'Flower Drum' was changed to 'Playing the Flower Drum.'"</p>
<p>Southern Kunqu operas all have this play, but among the northern actors, only Mao Shilai has sung it in Shanghai. I saw Hua Huilin, Du Wenlin, and Han Jinkui perform together at the Golden Theater, which was very popular with the audience. Du Wenlin's crude movements and foolish demeanor were just like a bastard. Han Jinkui's sneaky face and glib mannerisms were truly a lustful ghost, acting like a suave playboy. With the petite, exquisite, charming Hua Huilin in the middle, it was naturally easy to please.</p>
<p>Besides the anti-Ming elements in this play, I think there are also some that depict the feelings of ordinary couples. So, as soon as she enters, the female lead sings (Carrying the flower drum on my back and holding the gong, husband and wife are as close as scales and weights, my face is pretty, and I can sing the rice planting song, walking through the streets and alleys, my feet are as fast as shuttles, I'm not afraid of crowds in the playhouse, my man, you beat the gong and I'll help with the drum, you beat the gong and I'll help with the drum.) And in the epilogue, it is (Having endured the hardships of wind and frost, there is only hunger and cold, alas! My man! I'll go through the streets and lanes with you, and sing with you again.)</p>

<p>— Chan</p>
<p>"Gone with the Wind" star Vivien Leigh and her husband Laurence Olivier quietly returned to their homeland after collaborating on the film "That Hamilton Woman" in Hollywood, which chronicles the career and love story of British Admiral Nelson.</p>
<p>A few days after they arrived in England, the famous American film reporter Louella Parsons received special permission from the British government to have a brief conversation with Vivien Leigh, who was far away in London, using a transatlantic telephone line from New York. This female reporter considered it the greatest and most exciting interview of her career, so she specially published it in Oregonian magazine so that fans could learn a little about Vivien Leigh and her husband's current situation. The following is a partial translation:</p>
<p>When I (Louella herself) heard Vivien Leigh's voice coming from afar, I said to her, "The Colmans, the Ritchies, the Cukors, and other Hollywood friends send their regards to you both and asked me to inquire about your current situation."</p>
<p>"Oh! Them?" she asked. "I must send my regards to them as well, because we both feel that we should do something for our country, so we have now returned to London with great pleasure!"</p>
<p>Ah! Her accent was completely unlike Scarlett O'Hara's in "Gone with the Wind." After returning to England, even her voice became very British. So, on the phone, I began to ask her some serious questions.</p>
<p>"What are you and Laurence Olivier doing now?"</p>
<p>"Laurence is currently filming a movie called "49th Parallel," and I am planning to prepare for a play. England needs good entertainment, so we are trying our best to do something in this area."</p>
<p>"Are there many plays being staged now?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"Oh! A few actors are working," she said. "But things seem to be very sluggish. The play "Dear Brutus" is being performed on stage every night. The people here are as calm as ever and very brave."</p>
<p>Finally, she said, "Please tell Hollywood to send more American films here."</p>

<p>Chapter 6: Briefly Intoxicated Beauty Beside the Brocade Zither</p>
<p>The magistrate of Qi County sneered and said, "I initially thought you were a disciple of Mencius and Lord Pingyuan, so when the bandits came to attack the city last time, I specially invited you to help defend the city. Who knew that you were colluding with the bandits of Green Stone Mountain. If it weren't for my keen observation, I would have almost been deceived by you." Li Xin hurriedly argued, "How can you say that I am colluding with the bandits? I am a great man, how could I be a thief?" The magistrate of Qi County said, "Don't quibble! The last time you were captured, I was already a little suspicious. Since the bandits came in large numbers, killing government soldiers, their power was not small, but why did they capture only you and then retreat? There must be a flaw in this. Therefore, I summoned all your Zhuang Ding and questioned them one by one in detail, and I finally found it out. One of them, named Fang Fatty, told me that the female bandit and her accomplices had come to your village before, claiming to sell their skills, but secretly discussed things. Your capture was a scam." Hearing this, Li Xin realized that Fang Fatty was the one who had been injured by the ten Red Maidens, so he held a grudge in his heart. So he said, "If I were colluding with the bandits, why didn't I open the door and welcome them in, and instead let myself be captured?" The magistrate of Qi County said, "I also thought about this, and sent people to Green Stone Mountain to secretly investigate, and then I learned that you had married the female bandit on the mountain and become a bandit leader. I guessed that you would definitely come back, so I kept quiet and secretly waited. Yesterday, Fang Fatty came to inform me, so I captured you today. You must have returned to the city this time to cooperate with them from the inside and outside, to devastate the area, how could I easily spare you?" Li Xin sighed deeply and was about to say more when the magistrate of Qi County ordered the constables to throw Li Xin into prison and keep a close watch on him. He also went to search Li's village, confiscating all of Li Xin's property, and putting the family members under surveillance. He prepared a document to report to his superiors, intending to execute Li Xin. After Li Xin was imprisoned, the iron chains clanged, and he experienced the taste of being behind bars. He felt unspeakable resentment in his heart. He had thought of escaping back because he refused to surrender to the bandits, but who knew that he would suffer such an injustice. Then, wouldn't my life be given away for nothing? We are sworn brothers, four of us, and three of them have joined the army, but I alone will die here. It's truly unjust! If I had known this, I would have stayed on the mountain with Red Maiden. So he sighed all day long and couldn't swallow his food. After a few days, one night, he was sitting alone in the darkness, listening to the silence around him. The prison was as silent as death, and he couldn't help but sigh deeply. Suddenly, a small point of light appeared in front of his eyes. It wasn't an illusion, it was real. His heart couldn't help but stir. (End of Chapter 6)</p>

<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>A person cannot be without life. Without life, there is no person at all. At the same time, having life does not necessarily mean being a person. There are many people in the world who are born but do not become human beings. My life must seek to be a life of a person, so that I will not fail my life. My life must have a view, and the view must conform to reality. This is the true meaning of the three words "worldview."</p>

<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Since Zhang Huicong is pregnant and waiting to give birth, Kun Dan (female role) Han Suolan was invited to fill the vacancy by the Ping Theater in Xian Shi Amusement Park. Now, the Tianchan Stage wants to hire Suolan to replace Han Suqiu, who is on leave due to illness. However, the Xian Shi Amusement Park relies heavily on her and insists on keeping her, so Suolan can only decline the Tianchan Stage.</p>
<p>Movie star Wang Yin is producing a film at his own expense, originally titled "The Soul Returns to the Great Hatred," but he thought it was not popular enough. The night before last, he and Pei Chong studied this issue and wrote many titles such as "Tears Sprinkled on the Land of Longing," "Mandarin Duck Calamity," and "Heartbroken Flower." As a result, they thought "Heartbroken Flower" was more suitable, but it still needs to be carefully considered before it can be determined.</p>
