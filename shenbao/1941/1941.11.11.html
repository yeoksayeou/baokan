<h3 id="c24">第一次世界大戰休戰紀念 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>今天十一月十一日，是前次世界大戰休戰紀念日。回想二十三年之前，歐陸西綫的協約國軍隊，在德軍最後攻勢失敗之後猛力反攻，經過三個月的苦戰，在軍事上則突破了最頑强的興登堡防錢，在政治上則解體了德國各個外圍與國，結果荷恩索倫王朝宣吿傾圯，德方終於接受了協約國的停戰條件，於一九一八年的今天在貢比臬森林的著名火車中簽署停戰協定，結束了四載有奇的空前血戰，那時各處人民欣喜欲狂的印象依稀猶在目前。然而歷史終於不免重演，全世界之再度被牽入大戰漩渦，於今又已是兩年了。</p>
<p>追溯此次大戰發生的原因，其端不一；有如列强經濟政治發展的不平衡狀况，政制思想體系上的衝突，以至列强已往若干當局的缺乏遠見，都要担負相當責任，然而溯本淸源，却不能不承認主耍是凡爾賽和約種下的惡因。當大戰初停之際，所有公正人士都期望着威爾遜所主張的「沒有勝利的和平」能獲實現，他所主張的十四點也應該是和約最妥適的根據。無奈在凡爾賽和會當中，仍舊是報復和自私的觀念籠罩着一切，幾乎沒有理想主義存在餘地，威爾遜的主張在受盡嘲弄之餘，被擱置在一旁，大會所產生的合約從不能不包括若干堂皇條款有如組織國聯之類，其主要性質則注定了如果不是協約國永遠控制着德意志，便是前者必難免遭受後者的報復。這一不幸的因素，已經在近年來的事實中獲得證實了。</p>
<p>現在全世界都籠罩在戰雲瀰漫之中，為了懲昔毖今，首先便不能不鄭重考慮使已往覆轍不致重演。揆之近來的實際情况，已足證明這二十餘年間的教訓與經騐已經發生相當效果，去年八月間英美所共同褐布的八項條件就是一例而尤重要者則為維護正義反抗侵略一念之深入人心，不是任何自私苟安的打算所能抑制，時至今日，不惟形成全世界的共同信念，亦且成為民治各邦聯合作戰的共同目標。前次大戰曾造下若干罪惡的國際政治陰謀與秘密外交，於今在民治陣容中縱未完全絕跡，亦已减少到最小限度，間接替未來世界袪除了不幸的根源。</p>
<p>然而前次大戰的結果終究代表着人類歷史的一種進步，歐陸最後殘存的專制政權被淸除了，新的經濟政治理想與制度則開始從事實騐，而世界各國間的國際合作卽使結果是失敗多於成就，也未嘗不替將來的發展奠定了初步的根基。準此而論，則到此次大戰結束，侵略消匿，正義重張，世界和人願必能進入一個新的理想境界，各種制度方面亦當實現合理的改造。現雖距離戰爭結束之日有相當時日，且尚需更大更多的奮力　可望澈底情除頑強的侵略罪惡，而對於未來的光明前途，則無疑是可以加以絕對信賴的。</p>
<h3 id="c25">世界和平目標之前奏 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>羅斯福總統日前向工會致詞時，眷注世上不知若干萬萬人民飽受凍　露宿之痛苦，而重申其餘世界和平回覆后實現人類生活均等享受之決心，幷聲明已著手是項計畫之進行。同時，希特勒一再為抨擊民主陣線之宣傳，指英人為世界政治經濟之破壞者，凡帝國主義之毒　，國際資本之侵略，社會經濟之恐慌與非份之利得等罪狀，無一不加諸於英美之制度。為揄揚納粹之「德政」計，希特勒對歐洲佔領區內之人民，凡無叛國罪者概保證其麵包，工作與一切生活安全之享受，且已積極實施此項　糜政策。</p>
<p>由此可知前線之滅戰爭，仍有賴於後方和平經濟生活之支撐。換言之，今日前線血戰所欲解決者，殆為今后人類之經濟生活；卽能獲致戰場上之勝利而不能獲致經濟上之勝利，自不能完成其勝利之目標而終必趨於失敗之途，此卽第一次世界大戰凡爾賽合約之遺憾而為今人所急欲避免者葉。是故第二次世界大戰之意義與責任。自非可與第一次世界大戰同日而語；且為今日民主陣綫最艱巨之重負。舉世所希收鑊於戰果者在此，全人類之期望於民主國者亦在此。</p>
<p>職是之故。獲致軍事之勝利由於民主陣綫之全盤合作當可指日而待，惟和平恢復後之最後勝利，其把握之信念反不若前者之堅强，此蓋由於第一次大戰軍事勝利後未能繼之以政治與經濟勝利所以使然也。今日希特勒抨擊民主國經濟制度之缺陷能否加以適當之糾正？我人從公認羅斯福必能貫澈其政治主張，但在經濟條伴上將如何實現其人類生活之均等享受方式，此皆世界和平目標之大前提，必須予以及時之規畫與實施，若待諸戰後而始為解決，勢將失去時機，此在民主國領袖諒早有見及此，羅邱之大西洋艦上會談自必涉及於此根本問題，我人可靜待事實之證明。</p>
<p>關於民主陣綫之合作所最咸棘手者，厥維歐洲政治與經濟二端，而尤以後者為焦點。對於遠東問題，論者輙以為歐洲問題獲有圓滿解決後，卽可迎刃而解，母庸為單獨之解決。</p>
<p>然則解決歐洲之問題將採何方式乎？據華突氏最近之主張，其先決之條件，端在英美澈底合作，美國願接管海洋中英國島嶼為前哨之防錢，則於戰後自不能不與英國共同派兵接管歐洲大陸侵略國與納粹征服國之政治以竟前功。在德國原有版圖內或由英國遠征軍單獨接管，亦無不可。</p>
<p>關於經濟制度方面，華突氏則力主繼績戰時經濟與實施計盡經濟，所有「公用事業」，「鑰匙工業」以及重要原料，槪由英美統制，如此始可使各國人民享受安全與自由之生活，而可提倡人類奮鬥創作之精神，幷可避免人類之互相殘殺。有謂是項方式之有損國家主權而將遭各國人民之反對，且在德國境內其反對必更强烈，此固皆杞人憂天之說，蓋目前在納粹統治下之歐洲大陸，人民縱有生活之保障，但絕無自由之可言，共在英美民主精神領導之人民，自必可安居樂業而共謀人類合作之百年大計。華突氏最後以為今後之世界在軍事政治與經濟上各國皆有互相為命之關係，所謂獨立完整之主權觀念，勢將有修正之必要，華突氏為當今重要思想家，姑為介紹，以觀其後。</p>

<p>自軍興以來，本市人口，多至五六百萬，基督教徒，由外埠避難來此者，亦有相當之數目。總計不下二萬左右，非基督徒，實占白分之九十七，恰如歐洲史上古繳馬帝國之與第一世紀的基督敎信徒所差無幾。茲因簸優秀之大　道家，皆相　由海外歸來，教會各團體鑒於投機公開，惡孽橫行，貪得無厭者，其財富每日增加，憑其造孽錢而驕奢淫佚。薪水階級，受經濟壓迫，誰不在死亡綫上掙扎？人心蹈溺，至於此極！為挽救世道，廣傳福音起見，由上海基督徒佈道團·上海基督教傳道聯會.上海基督教奮進會·伯特利神學院·甘氏聖徒學院五團體台作，發動全滬擴大佈道週。先組織執行委員會，公舉竺規身·諸重華·兪止齋、湯仁熙·計志文.林道亮各牧師，及樂俊英先生，分仟委員會正副主席。暨總務·文　·經濟.佈道。視察。各組幹事，負責籌備進行。自十月十五日召集第一次會議後，每禮拜三下午五點，皆假慕爾堂聚大佈道之程序討論會，現已決定者，有下列各項。，</p>
<p>佈道地點，分為處洽卿路慕爾堂，山東路麥家圈天安堂，三馬路外國墳山內聖保羅堂，康　脫路中華　　教堂四　，對外開講。</p>
<p>佈道日期及時間，已定於十一月十日（助禮拜一）起至十六日止，共計一禮拜，時間為每晚七點半至九點半，同時在福音廣播電臺，亦有佈道家播　佈道。</p>
<p>講員，本次擴大佈道週，原定講員為計志文.趙世光·戚慶才·林道亮四牧師。因計林兩牧師係由美新近歸國，趙牧師亦由南洋爪哇返滬。今趙牧師赴港講道，戚牧師十一日須赴皖省毫縣領奮興會。於是佈道組不得不重新分配，天安堂講員為林道亮牧師，聖保羅堂講員，特請由內地及斐律賓回上海之顧立思牧師張建國先生，中華基督教堂講員為汪飛翔牧師，錢圖運先生，第五開由　工社　員　，第六第七兩天。趙牧師可由　趕到，請趙牧師主講。</p>
<p>分發勸世文，共十四萬張，由伯特利教會捐助三萬張，其餘十一萬張，已經加緊印好。字句淺明，正面係特編之詩歌，負分發責任者，為佈道團團員。十五日由各教會學校男女學生，負責分送，大約在電車公共汽車，各主要馬路，均由佈道團團員，自十日起，分發此項勸世文。</p>
<p>刊登封面廣告，用意在使本市閱報者，皆知基督教會，正在舉行大佈道。封面廣告，代價至昂，每刊一日，須一千數百元，然而新聞報已由天安堂靑年團契所捐助，申報為某藥廠之藥師所捐助，另有其他熱心信徒，出資刊中美日報等。鶴鳴鞋帽商店，更捐助電影廣告。</p>
<p>點聖　語，分為四種，最大一種分貼公共汽車及各大商店之玻窗上，第二種貼於公共租界之電車上，第三第四兩種，可以貼於私人汽車，及包車上.此項標語，繪有十字架，與至明顯之聖經字句，五采奪目，十分美觀。此舉係得力於之江大學校長工部局美董明思德博士之吹噓，又承公共租界電車及公共汽車公司之贊助，不收分文。聞此項標語，大小各種，亦印萬份以上，所費至鉅也。</p>
<p>福音車在佈道週內，擬游行公共租界，上面扯以白布大旂，黏貼標語。車中有唱詩班，音樂隊，每到熱閙市區，下車分發勸世文，在汽車開動時，唱詩班唱詩，音樂隊奏樂，法租界亦擬租一大汽車，同樣舉行。</p>
<p>招待及佈置放音機，天安堂·聖保羅堂·中華基督教堂.均由各該教會之牧師，自行照料，更有熱心信徒，担任招待。慕爾堂之招待，由　工社派人充任，在慕爾堂及中華某督教堂，皆特裝放音機。</p>
<p>禁食禱吿，已於十一月三日，由執行委員會各委員，在天安堂舉行一次，作至懇切之　求，在中午十二點，均禁食一餐，以昭慶敬。</p>
<p>善後工作，此次大佈道，如有人慕道簽名，擬在十七日開歡迎　道人大會，十八十九兩日，由主講人施以培隨工作，二十日再集一次執行委員會，宣吿結束。今次擴大佈道周，完全按英美大佈道之辦法，不分宗派，一致努力，在上海寶係創舉也。</p>

<h3 id="c67">微婚制度的推行 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>在婚姻介紹所做個多年幹事的馥萊女士向一班硏究婚姻問題的學生說·「許參人建議，此後結婚節目中，再也不要加上一介紹人」的幌子；甚至他們認為婚書上有了介紹人的簽字，是侮辱他們的神聖……這班絕端者，並目髙呼「不容介紹人的蠅足，沾了淸潔的婚姻」</p>
<p>確是這樣，現在一般美國靑年結合的過程中，很少經過專指的介紹人的。他們會大膽地在報紙雜誌上公開徵婚，得到他（或她）的對象。這種趨勢，日日在推進中，據一位常做證婚人的牧師的統計，幾乎佔着百分之二十二强。這沒有別的，靑年們婚姻心理的轉變吧了，因為誰都覺得自動的探偶，是更有意味的。</p>
<p>除了少數失敗者外，他們的成功，着實給婚姻史上塗上一　鮮艷的色彩！他們多數能得到一個美滿的對象，成立一個愉快的家庭。到了今天，似乎誰都認為最好的介紹人，還是自己。</p>
<p>公開的微婚，只要能把握中心，是很好的一種制度。牠會給您一個意外的收穫，像哥侖布得了新大陸一樣！您可以沒有對象，在同學中，在朋友中，在鄰居中，在親戚中；但我相信這世界間沒有一個對象是屬於您的。也許一位在千里之外海濱垂釣的英俊靑年，就作了您理想的丈夫哩！</p>
<p>微婚最大的好處，就是牠是廣泛的，普遍的，使您可以减少「遺漏」的懊悔。</p>
<p>可是，誰都應該理會：牠是需要更冷靜的頭腦，更審愼的態度去應付的。不然，您會瞧見，世界上的英雄美人實在太多了，叫您無從選擇。</p>
<p>預備徵婚最大的條件，就是誠實，不要把自己吹的像天字第一號人物一般。最好，您能學一下金湯先生所寫的徵婚啟事：</p>
<p>「金湯，印第安混血種人，二十八歲足，中學差一學期輟學，現在幹萬國公寓招待員，午餐時問充紳士食堂僕歐，禮拜六晚並仟無終電城播音人侍候員，執有國家銀行A種特便儲單存摺一扣，計積數三百九十四元又百分之七十四（利息尙米計入）個性積極，臉皮不薄，體重一百四十磅，經富克醫生簽字證明，並無花柳病。如有淡於小姐氣味，而能慣過亭子間生活者，請於星期日上午親自到綿羊宿舍十六號面洽。」</p>
<p>請別笑這篇坦白的啟事，他已得着一位美　賢慧的伴侶了，他倆的家，還被譽為「樂　之家」喱！</p>
<p>我　的報章上，現在也起始見到幾個「微婚」一類的東西了。我們竭力贊同這個原則，可是同時我們頂嚴肅地說，別把牠當作一件鬧白玩」的事！許多　茁芽的苗，只容我們培植，不容我們摧殘！如果能够有規則的把微婚制度推行起來，以我國幅員之廣，人口之衆，誰說這不是增進幸福的事呢？至少，曠男怨女的數字，會减少一點吧！</p>

<h3 id="c68">原子分裂與勞倫斯 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 錢家駿</p>
<p>在十二年前的一個傍晚，加利福尼亞大學的賽二個眞空的長管，無數電的質點從.管子很快地射到別端。　簡單的器械，就是用為衝擊原子的最初模型了。</p>
<p>一個助手對那位教授說：「勞倫斯先生，力太小了，恐怕不能够擊碎原子吧。」勞倫斯點了點頭，於是他將十個眞空管理起來，用銅作兩極，中間跨一塊大磁石。當電流通了之後，雷子就由一極飛速射到另一極，磁石將電干吸到一個堅固的螺旋記速器，記下了極高的飛動速率。「成功了！」他不覺興奮地歡呼起來。</p>
<p>一九三九年，勞倫斯獲得了諾貝爾物理學獎金，因為他是世界上分裂原子的第一人呀。但是他還不認為滿足，現在正趕造一具比原來要大二十倍的射擊器，預備將原子因裂開而放出的能量，作為工業上的原動力。</p>
<p>六十年前的科學家，都認為原子為不可再分的細粒，現在大家都明瞭，每個原子好似太陽系，中部有一個核，四周有電子環繞不息。核中包含着質子和中子。各種物質都由電子，質于，中子所組成，不過排列的狀况各不相同。假使把一百萬的原子排成一錢，也僅將英文字母　的一點與一劃間空隙塡滿罷了，其微小程度，可以想見。但是核所佔原子的位置，正同一個蒼蠅在大廳成裏一樣。質子和中子就用很大的力互相結合包在核中，倘使要分裂它，當然需要極大的功率，所以勞倫斯的　初射擊器，竟用到一百萬伏特的電動勢。</p>
<p>現在普通的射擊儀器，也有一秒鐘一萬八千哩的速率，比來福槍彈快三萬五千倍。鈉原子被衝　，便成磁性，因為外部十一個電子由重氫供給而增至十二個。電子射擊，也能够使鋁轉變成磷，氮成為硼，並且更可具有暫時的放射性，這性質以前祗鐳和它同族元素所獨有的。</p>
<p>有幾種元素的原子，經射擊後能够放出中子光，醫師已用作治療人類及其他動物的毒瘤，據說很有效騐。藉勞倫期的發明，動物學家正硏究勸物的成長和新陳代謝，植物學家可以了解綠色植物如何由二氧化碳，水份與日光製成澱粉。工業方面講，放射性的氫能精煉石油，放射性的氯也能檢騐軍艦鋼板內部的聲密與否。據最近硏究，鈾如被擊開，可放出比碳多五千萬倍的熱能。</p>
<p>全世界的射擊原子器，共有三十七具。由勞倫斯設計的美國最大射擊機械，單是磁石已重四千九百噸，全部費用一百四十萬美金，經過三年方始竣工，需要電動勢達一萬萬伏特。當實騐進行的時候，連深入地下一百五十呎的控制室，也會感到劇烈震動呢。</p>

<p>不燃棉花是種便宜，輕性，耐久的絕緣體，很合日常家庭之）用，而且放在聖誕樹上做裝飾時亦不至再有危險。其製法係用一種能使纖維不燃的物質之晶體，將棉花纖維「包住」。詳情如何，外人不知。有人將燃至一千五百度之鉸釘置於兩磅不燃棉花中，結果至鉸釘冷却以後，棉花並無變化，唯份量輕掉百分之五耳。但逼射之火炬可將此租棉花洞穿，不過並無火熖，故火亦不致散開，如岡所示。</p>

<p>秋海棠的個性本來就很謙和，現在到了無路可走，不得不在上海充「觔斗虫」過活的日子，見了人當然越發小心了。那武管事的雖不知道他的來歷，可是瞧在小老板面上，介紹的時候，不免還給他吹了幾句：同時秋海棠自己也抱拳作揖的說了許多內行話，因此道個圈子兜完，印像倒非常的好，人人都跟他很說得合，一些沒有輕視的意思。</p>
<p>然而，事實上，人和人中間的關係，那有如此簡單呢？</p>
<p>「請你把衣服丟到那邊去，咱們當武行的總得守一些當武行的規矩！」他把外面一件破舊不堪的夾袍子脫了下來，才想掛到　板壁釘的一排衣鈎上去的時候，突然有一條很粗大的嗓子，在他身後這樣響着。</p>
<p>他一面來不及的把手收回來，一面很惶恐地旋過頭去。</p>
<p>不料站在他面前的竟就是方才經那武管事的特別替他介紹，再三請求照應的那個武行頭。這位先生的身村，大概至少耍比秋海棠髙出一個腦袋；倒圓臉，掃堂眉，再加上一對突出在眼皮以外大約有三四分光景的金魚眼，這一付生相已經很够教人害怕了！何况這時候，他的臉上叉顯着一種無從描繪的怪態，自然更使秋海棠慌得手足無措了！（二五九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">London's New Mayor Takes Office Last Night; British Prime Minister Delivers Important Speech; Ready for the Pacific Crisis; If the US and Japan Clash, Britain Will Declare War on Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th—Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech today at the luncheon on the inauguration day of the new Mayor of the City, Sir Laurie, stating that the war launched by Hitler has now spread across the entire European continent, invading Cambodia, North Africa, and involving the greater Asia, and may soon spread to the remaining quarter of the globe. The world has been greatly shocked by the Nazi massacre of French hostages. Even the inherently cruel Hitler is intimidated by the criticism of world opinion and dares not continue this process of massacring hostages. A large part of the American Navy is now taking action to deal with the common enemy. Regarding the Mediterranean, the passage of our supplies and the decline of Italian naval morale both indicate that the area is still under our control. We feel that if necessary, we have more than enough strength to send powerful naval forces to serve in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. At present, our air force is at least equal to the German side in quantity, not to mention the quality. We do not know whether the United States' efforts to maintain peace in the Pacific will be successful, but if they fail, then my duty compels me to take this opportunity to make a solemn declaration: if the United States is drawn into war against Japan, Britain will follow suit within an hour. In fact, if the Japanese people unnecessarily involve themselves in this world war, the future seems to be very dangerous, because in this war, Japan may find that the total population of the countries opposing it in the Pacific accounts for about three-quarters of humanity. If modern warfare is based on steel, then it is dangerous for Japan, with an annual steel production of only about seven million tons, to challenge the United States, which produces ninety million tons of steel annually, without reason, let alone adding the steel production of the British Empire. I sincerely hope that peace in the Pacific will be maintained according to the wishes of Japan's wisest politicians, but all preparations to defend British interests in the Far East and the common cause in the current crisis have been completed and are being improved. We have received reports from many sources that Berlin will soon make peace proposals again. Such signs have been found in various neutral countries. I now solemnly declare again that whether we have help or fight alone, no matter how long the period or how difficult the experience, Britain and its government will cooperate closely with the governments of the various autonomous regions and will never conduct any negotiations with Hitler or any representative of the Nazi regime in Germany. Recently, the Prime Minister also mentioned China, saying that if the Chinese nation's struggle to resist aggression fails to achieve liberation, it will be a great misfortune for world civilization. My feelings above are the emotions in our hearts.</p>
<p>United Press, Kansas City, 10th—Former Chief of Staff of the US Fleet, General Sterling, said in a speech here yesterday, "The American people, at this time when they are fully engaged in dealing with Hitler's actions in the Atlantic, have been aroused to fury by Japan's hostile attitude. If one believes that Japan today is stabbing the United States in the back with a white blade, then the issue of a US-Japan war has become a very common argument in any party in the United States. Generally, it is also believed that the country will face the situation it has felt before to make a final conclusion on the US-Japan issue. The United States is currently very willing to find ways to prevent Japan from actually cooperating with the Axis powers and engaging in shooting wars, because Britain recognizes that its war with Hitler is inevitable and wants to avoid a two-ocean war." He also said that once the United States and Japan go to war, Britain will inevitably launch an engagement with the Japanese from Singapore, and the United States will also try to use bombers to bomb Japan from Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th—The Times' editorial today stated that the recent discussions between the British Far East Representative Duff Cooper, the Commander-in-Chief of India Wavell, and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces Parkin and Blamey are a sign of the increasingly tense and complex situation. In the current situation, political and military issues are more closely linked than usual, and the interests of any part of the British Empire are also deeply involved. India is an important key to the common defense line, and it is also aware that if any party in the Axis wins, Indian civilization will come to an end from then on. Therefore, India, Burma, the Straits Settlements, and Hong Kong are all paying great attention to the fate of the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and China at this time. This concern travels across the Pacific Ocean to Canada and the United States. The feeling of common danger and common interests unites the people around the Pacific, and the future developments in the Pacific will be closely linked to the fate of the war in the Soviet Union. Because of the Soviet Union's power and the vastness of its territory, the Soviet Union is a factor in the Pacific that is just as important as on the European and Middle Eastern fronts. In recent months, a large number of reinforcements in many parts of the world have arrived in Singapore. This is an open secret. Although the terrain makes Singapore a natural military concentration point for the safety of the Pacific, whether it is also the most convenient central point for adjusting political and strategic decisions is another matter. Certainly, an agency is needed to quickly exchange views on common defense in the Pacific among the countries concerned. The United States' material and spiritual interests and its authority make it necessary for the US government to be fully aware of the various steps taken and planned, and the methods set should also have the full consent of the US government. Because if Britain, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands unite and persevere, they can resist aggression from any direction. If Britain, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands clearly express their position through their actions, there will be less possibility of being forced to test their united strength in any new war.</p>
<h3 id="e2">At the Reception for Reporters, Jiang Ting-fu Analyzes Japan's Recent Attempts; Peace with the US is a Trick Like Hitler's Against Britain; "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is Actually Another Name for an Economic Bloc <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Secretary-General Jiang of the Executive Yuan of Chongqing made the following remarks at a reception for foreign reporters on the 10th: Recently, while the Japanese army has been increasing troops in Vietnam, it has also sent Kurusu to the United States. According to official and non-official Japanese statements, Japan's intentions are twofold: one is to maintain peace between the United States and Japan, and the other is to build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." There is no need to say much about the first point. Years ago, Hitler also presented himself as a pacifist. In fact, Hitler's intention was nothing more than to have European countries accept German hegemony, and Germany could avoid using force. What we should pay particular attention to is that although Hitler once used peace to seduce all of Germany's neighbors, his peace offensive paid special attention to Britain. He repeatedly declared that Germany had no ambitions towards Britain, that there was no conflict of interest between Germany and Britain, and that Germany and Britain should and could make peace. Today, the people of England must regret that British leaders were once seduced by this peace. The current Japanese peace offensive against the United States is the same as Hitler's strategy a few years ago. If the countries along the Pacific coast are willing to accept Japan's oppression, we may be able to obtain short-term peace, but the pain of this kind of peace far exceeds any tragic war. Fortunately, none of the Pacific countries are willing to accept this kind of peace. President Roosevelt's recent speech to the International Labor Conference has earnestly reiterated the position of the United States. In addition, Australia and the Dutch East Indies are neither deceived by the Japanese peace nor moved by Japan's increasing troops in Vietnam. As for China, our determination to fight to the end is beyond doubt. The attitudes of the Pacific countries towards Japan's recent strategy have already achieved a complete understanding. As for what the Japanese call the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," what they want to say can be summarized in one sentence, that is, the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" is a sphere of common suffering and common death. Economically speaking, the trade between China and Japan is far less important than the trade between the two countries and Europe, the United States, and South America. Japan lacks rice, and so does China. Japan does not produce oil, and neither does China. Japan feels that it lacks coal and iron, and China does not have a large surplus of coal and iron. Japan exports silk and tea, and so does China. In addition, China also exports tung oil, but Japan does not import our tung oil. The above extremely obvious economic facts must be well known to Japanese ambitious people, but they repeatedly use the establishment of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as the theme of their propaganda. The reason is none other than that Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere must include areas outside of East Asia. Therefore, I am even more convinced that Japan's peace is only a kind of propaganda strategy, and Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere" is actually another name for an economic bloc. We believe that bloc economics means collective poverty and will cause economic wars between blocs. We believe that the international economic liberalism announced by Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt after their meeting on the Atlantic is practical and can give all mankind hope for coexistence and common prosperity. Now Japan does not do this, but instead uses force to establish a medieval-style bloc economy, which proves that its intention is not peace but hegemony. (10th dispatch)</p>

<p>Luoyang—The Japanese troops retreating to Zhongmu County are trapped and waiting for reinforcements. At dawn on the 8th, when the Japanese troops were exhausted, the Chinese troops rushed into the West Gate in one fell swoop. The Japanese climbed onto the roofs, trying to resist stubbornly. The Chinese troops threw hand grenades, killing many Japanese. The Japanese could not hold out and retreated to the city. As for the Japanese troops trapped in Youhe Town, Qiaobawangcheng, and other places, after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese troops, they suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese then used the wind direction to release poison gas. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese troops still withdrew to their original defense lines. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang—The Japanese troops supporting southern Henan, except for the cavalry west of Youhe, the rest returned to Xinyang. The local order in southern Henan has returned to normal. The various Chinese guerrilla units have returned to their original positions. Because the Chinese army and civilians have experienced the previous Japanese invasion, the damage was relatively light. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji, Xinjiang—After the Chinese troops in the Xinjiang area recaptured Gutui Village, they continued to launch fierce attacks on the Japanese strongholds in Sucun, Xiaomiao, Yangzhaohe, and Kuoliu (north of Xinjiang). The Japanese suffered heavy losses. By the afternoon of the 6th, the Japanese could not hold out and fled in different directions. The Chinese troops then recovered all these places and pursued the Japanese in different directions. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing—According to Chinese sources, there was a melee war in the western suburbs of Zhongmu, east of Zhengzhou, yesterday. The Japanese troops were driven into Zhongmu City. The Japanese artillery units fired many gas shells in an attempt to stop the Chinese troops' advance. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Wartime Children's Welfare Association; Enthusiastic Donations from All Sides; A Total of More Than 10,000 Refugee Children are Cared For; Most of the Funding is Raised by Madame Chiang <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing—Since its establishment, the Wartime Children's Welfare Association has cared for more than 25,000 refugee children in various war zones. Most of the funding is raised by Madame Chiang through donations from various circles at home and abroad. Recently, Madame Chiang has received a large amount of donations, including US$2,000 from Princess Hoger of India and US$2,000 from Mr. Anger of the United States. Mr. Chapman's younger brother is a doctor at Lake Chuan Hospital and is usually passionate about China and actively involved in various relief and welfare undertakings. The brothers Huang Ming'an and Huang Jin'ying of Sichuan donated 100,000 national currency to commemorate their mother's 60th birthday. Mr. Huang Ming'an is the manager of the Sancaisheng Coal Mine Company and a director of the Huahua Leather Company. Mr. Huang Jin'ying is a director of the Hengfeng Enterprise Company's Fuhua Bleaching Powder Company. They are the descendants of the late giant gentleman Huang Xizi. Over the years, they have vigorously assisted the New Life Movement and welfare undertakings. This time, they donated 100,000 yuan to the Welfare Association and 10,000 yuan to the New Life Movement Model Area for children's welfare undertakings. In addition, an anonymous person donated 4,144.438 yuan in national currency through Dr. Chen Wenyuan. Recently, Mr. Zheng Zhizhi, a wheat merchant in Hong Kong, donated 100,000 yuan in national currency to the Children's Welfare Association to commemorate his mother's 70th birthday. It is also heard that Mr. Zheng plans to allocate some of the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends to Madame Chiang for relief purposes. Madame Chiang is very excited that all parties are extremely caring for the children's welfare undertakings. However, recently, because the cost of living in various places is increasing day by day, although donations from home and abroad are coming in steadily, they still feel insufficient. They deeply hope that compatriots at home and abroad will continue to enthusiastically donate to actively promote the welfare undertakings and benefit the new citizens of the next generation.

<p>International News Service, Washington, 10th—The US Navy Department is busy gathering heavy artillery to major ports across the country. About 1,200 US merchant ships, it is heard that 400 of them will be armed. As for what impact the arming of merchant ships will have on US-German relations, the general public believes that it will not immediately lead to a severance of relations. The State Department has appointed Brownell, the director of the refugee department, to succeed Morris as the representative in Berlin.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 10th—The House of Representatives yesterday predicted that the Neutrality Act amendment would be passed on Thursday, thereby completing Congress's decision on the matter. Isolationist congressmen believe that this move will cause the United States to participate in the European war. According to Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the amendment will be passed by a vote of 75 to 100, but other leaders predict that the bill will be passed by a ratio of 30 to 40. The Navy, upon President Roosevelt's signing, has completed the installation of heavy artillery on US merchant ships. The Navy Department has prepared all the heavy artillery it can obtain, the largest being 5 inches. The Senate has passed the arming of American ships and entering belligerent ports and belligerent areas, and the House of Representatives initially passed the arming of American ships.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 10th—After Navy Secretary Knox announced the establishment of a US naval operations base in Iceland, naval observers believe that this move is another important step in preparing to directly transport supplies to British and Soviet seaports using American ships. These observers said that the official announcement that the base was established for management and operational purposes shows that comprehensive equipment has been completed to handle various types of warships. Naval observers pointed out that after Congress passes the lifting of the prohibition on American ships entering combat zones, the Iceland base will occupy an extremely important position in the Atlantic war. Although the Navy has not generally discussed this matter, it is expected that destroyers and seaplanes, as well as larger surface warships, will use the dangerous area east of Iceland as a departure zone. Although goods transported to Britain do not all have to pass near Iceland, it is believed that ships going to Soviet seaports in the Arctic Ocean will use the base on a large scale because of geographical reasons and the longer journey, or the need to add fuel. In addition, the Iceland base is also an extremely important link in the defense of the Western Hemisphere, because it is the easternmost base in the Atlantic. It has unlimited value for intercepting enemy ships attempting to enter the US national defense territorial waters.</p>

<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – The Admiralty announced that the British fleet achieved glorious results in the central Mediterranean yesterday. According to the communique, on Saturday afternoon, British reconnaissance planes sighted a convoy of eight supply ships south of Taranto, escorted by enemy destroyers. The British cruiser HMS Ajax (520 tons), under the command of Captain Agnew, was ordered to intercept them, along with HMS Penelope (5270 tons), and the destroyers HMS Lance and HMS Leofred. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, they made contact with the enemy ships and discovered another convoy of two supply ships escorted by two destroyers had joined the previously sighted large convoy and were protected by two 10,000-ton cruisers of the Trento class with 8-inch guns. Although the strength of the two sides was disparate, Captain Agnew ordered the ships to engage immediately. Before long, the enemy supply ships caught fire and nine sank, one of which was carrying ammunition and exploded as it sank. Another enemy ship, a 10,000-ton oil tanker, was also hit and caught fire. Ten hours later, the ship was still burning and is thought to have been completely destroyed by the fire. Among the Italian ships, one destroyer was sunk, and at least another one was heavily damaged. Today, another enemy destroyer was seen being towed by another ship. There were no casualties or damage to the British ships in this battle. On the way back to port, enemy planes attacked the British ships with torpedoes, but they were ineffective. After achieving this glorious victory, the ships returned to port safely. British Prime Minister Churchill has telegraphed the Admiralty to congratulate them on this important action, which seriously disrupted the enemy's supply line and hindered the enemy's operations against the Nile River.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – A British naval force has won its greatest victory in the Mediterranean since the Battle of Cape Matapan.

<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – The Admiralty announced today that the British destroyer HMS Cossack has been sunk. Although the ship was only completed three years ago, it has distinguished itself in three major battles in history. In 1940, in Norwegian territorial waters, it seized the German armed auxiliary ship Altmark and rescued imprisoned British sailors. In the Second Battle of Narvik, it sank seven German destroyers. It pursued the German battleship Bismarck, launching torpedoes at it. The ship normally had a crew of 219 men.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Director of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, Qiao Qiming, Studies Prices; Impact on People's Lives; Rice Prices Have Increased Thirtyfold Compared to Before the War; Wage Earners Suffer the Most <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Qiao Qiming, Director of the Agricultural Credit Bureau of the China Farmers Bank in Chongqing, has recently studied the impact of prices on people's lives, stating that rice prices are now 30 times higher than before the war, so landlords enjoy unearned profits. If the physical tax system is not changed, the land tax they pay is only 4% of what it was before the war. Tenant farmers, on the other hand, suffer because they pay most of their harvest as rent and rely only on spring miscellaneous grains to maintain their lives. The price increase of these crops is far less than that of rice and general goods. Exchanging these miscellaneous grains for daily necessities requires an increase of 60% or even double compared to before the war. For example, exchanging wheat for one catty of flour required 1.2 sheng before the war, but now requires 2.34 sheng. Those who profit from this are manufacturers and middlemen, whose dividends have increased fivefold compared to before the war. The people who suffer the most are wage earners. The cost of living index in June this year has risen to 1.655, while the income of university professors has only risen to 236, which is about one-seventh of the cost of living index. Laborers are better off, as their wage index can keep up with the cost of living index. Qiao Qiming taught in Chengdu for a long time and is a well-known economist. He was recently transferred to the position of Director of the Agricultural Credit Bureau. This article is based on Chengdu and its vicinity, and the situation in the wartime capital is even worse.

<h3 id="e24">Armistice Day of World War I <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Today, November 11th, is the anniversary of the armistice of the previous World War. Recalling twenty-three years ago, on the Western Front of Europe, the Allied forces, after the failure of the last German offensive, launched a vigorous counterattack. After three months of hard fighting, they broke through the most formidable Hindenburg Line militarily and disintegrated various countries on the periphery of Germany politically. As a result, the Hohenzollern dynasty was overthrown, and the German side finally accepted the Allied armistice conditions, signing the armistice agreement in the famous train carriage in the Forest of Compiègne on this day in 1918, ending the unprecedented bloody battle of over four years. The impression of the people's joy and frenzy everywhere at that time is still faintly present. However, history is inevitably repeating itself, and the whole world has been dragged into the vortex of war again for two years now.</p>
<p>Tracing the causes of this war, there are many contributing factors, such as the uneven development of economic and political power among the great powers, the conflict in political system and ideological systems, and the lack of foresight of some authorities in the past. However, tracing the source, it cannot be denied that the main cause was the evil sown by the Treaty of Versailles. When the war had just stopped, all fair-minded people expected that Wilson's "peace without victory" would be realized, and his proposed Fourteen Points should be the most appropriate basis for the peace treaty. Unfortunately, at the Versailles Peace Conference, the ideas of revenge and selfishness dominated everything, and there was almost no room for idealism. Wilson's proposals were ridiculed and set aside. The treaty produced by the conference could not but include some grandiose clauses, such as the establishment of the League of Nations. Its main nature was destined that if the Allied powers did not permanently control Germany, the former would inevitably suffer retaliation from the latter. This unfortunate factor has been confirmed in recent years' events.</p>
<p>Now the whole world is shrouded in war clouds. In order to learn from the past and avoid repeating mistakes, the first thing is to seriously consider how to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes. The recent actual situation has proved that the lessons and experiences of the past twenty years have had a considerable effect. The Eight Points jointly proclaimed by Britain and the United States in August last year are one example. What is particularly important is that the idea of upholding justice and resisting aggression has taken root in people's hearts, and cannot be suppressed by any selfish or opportunistic plan. To this day, it not only forms a common belief throughout the world but has also become a common goal of the united war effort of the democratic countries. The sinful international political conspiracies and secret diplomacy of the previous war, even if not completely eliminated in the democratic camp, have been reduced to a minimum, indirectly removing the root of misfortune for the future world.</p>
<p>However, the result of the previous war ultimately represented a kind of progress in human history. The last remaining autocratic regimes in Europe were eliminated, and new economic and political ideals and systems began to be tested in practice. Even if international cooperation among countries resulted in more failures than successes, it still laid a preliminary foundation for future development. On this basis, it can be said that when this war ends, aggression is eliminated, justice is restored, the world and people will surely enter a new ideal realm, and various systems will be rationally transformed. Although there is still considerable time before the end of the war, and even greater and more vigorous efforts are needed to completely eliminate the stubborn evil of aggression, there is no doubt that the bright future can be absolutely trusted.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Prelude to the Goal of World Peace <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In his recent address to the labor union, President Roosevelt paid attention to the suffering of countless millions of people in the world from cold and homelessness and reiterated his determination to achieve equal enjoyment of human life after the restoration of world peace and declared that he has begun to implement this plan. At the same time, Hitler repeatedly criticized the propaganda of the democratic front, pointing out that the British were the destroyers of the world's political economy, and all the crimes of imperialism, the aggression of international capital, the panic of the social economy, and the non-righteous profits were added to the Anglo-American system. In order to promote the "good governance" of the Nazis, Hitler guaranteed to the people in the occupied areas of Europe who were not guilty of treason that they would enjoy bread, work, and all the security of life and has actively implemented this appeasement policy.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the war at the front still depends on the support of peaceful economic life in the rear. In other words, what today's bloody battle at the front wants to solve is the economic life of mankind in the future; that is, if it can win the victory on the battlefield but cannot win the economic victory, it will not be able to complete its victory goal and will eventually tend to fail. This is the regret of the Treaty of Versailles of the First World War and what people today urgently want to avoid. Therefore, the meaning and responsibility of the Second World War cannot be compared with the First World War; it is also the most difficult burden of the democratic front today. What the world hopes to reap from the war is here, and the hope of all mankind for democratic countries is also here.</p>
<p>Therefore, the victory in the military field due to the overall cooperation of the democratic front can be expected in the near future, but the conviction of the final victory after the restoration of peace is not as strong as the former, which is due to the failure to follow up the military victory of the First World War with political and economic victories. Can the defects of the economic system of the democratic countries that Hitler criticized today be corrected appropriately? We recognize that Roosevelt will be able to implement his political propositions, but how will he realize his human life's equal enjoyment in the economic terms? These are all major premises for the goal of world peace, which must be planned and implemented in a timely manner. If we wait until after the war to solve them, we will lose the opportunity. The leaders of the democratic countries have long seen this, and the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting on the Atlantic ship will inevitably involve this fundamental issue. We can wait quietly for the proof of the facts.</p>
<p>Among the cooperation of the democratic front, what is most thorny is the political and economic aspects of Europe, and especially the latter is the focus. Regarding the Far East issue, some commentators often think that after the European issue has a satisfactory solution, it can be solved easily, without the need for a separate solution.</p>
<p>But what method will be adopted to solve the European issue? According to H.G. Wells's recent claim, its prerequisite is that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate thoroughly. The United States is willing to take over the British islands in the ocean as the outpost defense line, and it cannot but dispatch troops together with the United Kingdom after the war to take over the politics of the invading countries and Nazi conquered countries in the European continent to complete the previous achievements. It is also possible for the British Expeditionary Force to take over alone in Germany's original territory.</p>
<p>Regarding the economic system, H.G. Wells strongly advocates continuing the wartime economy and implementing the planned economy. All "public utilities," "key industries," and important raw materials should be controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States, so that people of all countries can enjoy a life of safety and freedom, and can promote the spirit of human struggle and creation, and can avoid the mutual slaughter of mankind. Some say that this method will harm national sovereignty and will be opposed by the people of various countries, and that the opposition will be even stronger in Germany. These are all worries about the sky. At present, on the European continent under Nazi rule, the people have security of life, but there is no freedom to speak of. The people led by the Anglo-American democratic spirit will surely be able to live and work in peace and jointly seek the century-old plan of human cooperation. H.G. Wells finally believes that in the future world, all countries have a relationship of mutual dependence in military, political, and economic terms, and the concept of independent and complete sovereignty will have to be revised. H.G. Wells is an important thinker today, so let's introduce him to see what happens later.</p>

<p>Kuybyshev, 10th (Reuters) – The Red Army did not suffer from the cold wind during the revolutionary anniversary parade held here. This is a different kind of parade from the usual parade, so its impression is particularly moving. The troops marched through Kuybyshev Square for about two hours. Participating in the parade were infantry units armed with new automatic weapons, machine gun units, artillery units towed by horses and trucks, armored vehicle units with anti-aircraft guns, and light and heavy tank units. About 50 fighter planes flew in formation overhead. New recruits from training camps also participated in the drill in black uniforms, and their movements were also very orderly. The overall military appearance was excellent. The Red Army soldiers talked and laughed during the break. Large teams of factory workers also carried flags. When Voroshilov inspected the teams before giving his speech, the Red Army cheered to welcome him. Standing with Voroshilov were government officials such as Kalinin and Vyshinsky.</p>

<p>TASS, Kubyshev, 10th: Marshal of the Soviet Union Voroshilov delivered the following speech here on the 7th during a Red Army parade: Comrades, Red Army soldiers, commanders, political instructors, and armed comrades from all industrial, agricultural, and cultural sectors! I am instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government to extend my congratulations to all of you on the 24th anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution. Today, as we welcome the 24th anniversary of our glorious history, our motherland is at war, and the Soviet people are defending their lives, independence, and honor against the perfidious invasion of German fascism. The Red Army and Navy, from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, have been fighting the German fascists and the armies of Hitler's protectorates, Finland, Italy, Hungary, and Romania, for four months. In this war, countless soldiers, generals, commanders, political instructors, and other Red Army and Navy fighters have</p>
<p>heroically fallen on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Today, on our national day, we bow our heads in remembrance. Red Army soldiers, generals, commanders, political instructors, and all armed personnel are fighting bravely on all fronts under the leadership of our great Stalin. The defenders of Leningrad are displaying outstanding courage. Tens of thousands of enemy corpses have piled up at the entrance to Leningrad, suffocated by their own black blood. The enemy there has been forced to switch from offense to defense. Kiev, Odessa, and other cities in our country have also shown boundless courage and heroism. The enemy has paid a heavy price for their temporary victories. Currently, the enemy is exerting all their strength to attack Moscow, attempting to occupy our capital. Hitler is sacrificing the blood of his German slaves, driving tens of thousands of soldiers towards our barbed wire, trenches, machine guns, cannons, and tanks. The lesson Hitler received in Leningrad is not enough. He is now receiving the same cruel lesson in Moscow. In Moscow, Hitler will not only break his teeth, but his spine will also be shattered. When Hitler planned his perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, he did not expect the Red Army to inflict upon them the</p>
<p>powerful setbacks</p>
<p>they have already received.</p>
<p>The easy victories of the German fascists in Europe made Hitler dream that he could easily defeat the Red Army. His basis was: 1. A sudden, perfidious attack on the Red Army. 2. The German fascist army was fully mobilized and united due to the war. After looting Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece, a large amount of military equipment was available for the German army's use. A fully armed murderer launching a sudden attack from behind usually has an advantage over the attacked. However, this time Hitler stretched his reach too far, and his calculations were extremely wrong. Hitler promised the German people an easy victory, but in reality, it has become a terrible bloodbath for the fascists. The fascists have never seen anything like this, and the result will be their destruction. The "future paradise" touted by the German propaganda machine is now filled with fascist corpses. Our compatriots in the temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Karelia have organized guerrilla units to fight against their invaders. Their activities are expanding daily. Currently, guerrilla warfare has made it impossible for the German fascists in the occupied areas to live peacefully or engage in looting. The guerrillas are like a</p>
<p>nightmare</p>
<p>to the German rear.</p>
<p>However, guerrilla warfare is still in its initial stage. In the future, it will develop into a deadly battle against the invaders. Since the German fascists cannot stop their military adventure halfway, they continue to send fresh troops into the war. We must destroy these thugs, leaving not a single one alive. This is our greatest and most sacred duty. We are defending our motherland, our homes, and our future. No matter how large the enemy's numbers, we must fight until all the fascists are destroyed. Hitler and his fascist generals believe that the strength of the Soviet military and civilians is nearly exhausted. The fascists believe that the day when they can enter the "paradise" to loot and kill, replacing it with "superior fascist culture," is near. But they are mistaken. The Soviet state's reserve strength is still enormous, more than enough to fight until not a single fascist remains. However, the Red Army, the Navy, and all Soviet people must further strengthen their will, further develop the quality of military equipment, make the use of various electrical devices more perfect, and pay more attention to the details of military operations, because this will determine the victory of the war. In the war against German and Italian fascist imperialism, the Soviet Union is currently the</p>
<p>central military force</p>
<p>in the united front of enslaved Slavic peoples and freedom-loving people of Europe.</p>
<p>The day when the Slavic people, such as the Yugoslavs, rise up united to resist the invaders and sweep them away is near. The Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, in a united war with the British Army and Navy and other freedom-loving countries, enjoy the active assistance of the great democratic nation, the United States. The United States will continue to fight until German and Italian imperialism are completely destroyed. The disaster that endangers all people worldwide must and will be destroyed. Comrades, war is a great misfortune. War destroys the achievements of the people's hard work in peacetime. Therefore, we must work together to reduce the disruption to life. The war will definitely be protracted, cruel, and fierce. Therefore, we need the unwavering will and utmost effort of the entire working population, and heroic soldiers, to fight with blood for the life of the motherland and the future of our descendants. We must fully supply the front lines with materials. In this great war, Soviet women are working in the rear and at the front, displaying heroism like Soviet men. Countless women have joined industry, but the number must be increased further. Women must replace men in their work, because they are needed everywhere. The working masses of the Soviet Union, including industrial and agricultural workers, must redouble their efforts and increase their work rate in order to</p>
<p>defeat the enemy sooner.</p>
<p>Long live the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution! Long live the heroic Red Army and Navy! Long live the Soviet people! Long live the Lenin-Stalin Party!</p>

<h3 id="e30">Benevolent Actions by the Two Concessions Bring Rice Prices Back on Track; Citizens Are Delighted and Rice Shops Are Busy; Officials Have Done Two Big Things but Still Lack the Middle Part <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The actions taken by the Public Works Department yesterday regarding the rice market have the character of King Wei of Qi, who does not soar until he soars, and does not speak until he startles everyone. The rice market was immediately stabilized, and the people's hearts were greatly relieved. This is its greatest success. However, the shortcoming lies in the fact that two things have been done, but the middle part is still lacking. Therefore, in front of many rice shops yesterday, there were many neatly dressed people crowding together to buy a dou of rice. As a result, although there was widespread selling, the momentum of crowding could not be completely eliminated. From morning to night, apart from rice shops saying they had no rice, the rice shop officials suffered a lot. In the past, selling five dou of rice only required one procedure, but now it requires five procedures. It is inevitably hard work, but it can be considered as fulfilling a slight obligation to the public. However, it is slightly better than the rise and fall of prices, and it is inevitable that there will be more hidden losses. Fortunately, the rice shops are all experts, and they think they will not make the weight inaccurate, and they will not suffer losses themselves. If they can get through it, that's it. However, if this continues, it is inevitable that there will be passive resistance and secret sabotage, which should be paid attention to. Secondly, the hoarders and the bank loaners have suffered, but this is not to be regretted. Hoarding medicines to kill people is the same kind of retribution.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the authorities of the light southern concession of foreign rice restricted the maximum price of each bag to be no more than 158.5 yuan, and the maximum price of each shi to be no more than 130 yuan. The turbulent situation of manipulation and monopoly in the past few weeks has been clarified by this action. However, those who have already made agreements but have not yet concluded them have also had disputes because of this. Those who hold the goods are mostly unwilling to sell them cheaply, and the importers will definitely only buy them within the price limit. The transaction has to be stopped. The industry is currently meeting to discuss solutions in order to continue business.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Foreign Vermicelli and Grains; Hoarders Are Cautious <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The source of bean oil continues to come to Shanghai. The foreign vermicelli market has been affected by the restriction of foreign rice. Fearing that foreign vermicelli will also be subject to the same treatment, holders are trying to sell, but the actual sales have to be maintained, and customers dare not ask. The market has also stagnated invisibly. The initial asking price for Golden Dragon brand was 47 yuan, then 45 yuan, but there were no buyers. At 45 yuan, it is already 8 or 9 yuan lower than the 53 or 54 yuan at the end of last week. Wheat has also softened. The factory's door price is 75 yuan, and a small number of purchases have been made. Hoarders of miscellaneous grains are gradually worried because of the rice market. Therefore, the market is weak, and edible oil and corn have fallen by 5 to 10 yuan. The future still has a tendency to continue to fall. However, soybean cake is still firm. Dalian soybean oil and Qingdao raw oil are both 380 yuan, Jiangbei raw oil is 360 yuan, Dayou factory clear oil is 270 yuan, and Yoshida and paint factory vegetable oil are both 265 yuan. Dutch yellow corn is 43 or 44 yuan, white corn is 42 or 43 yuan, and Saigon old corn is 42 yuan, and new corn is 52 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake is 27 yuan. Today, there are 3,900 bags of beans and 1,016 bags of raw oil, all transported from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Struggle for Gold Is Still Fierce; The 20,000 Yuan Mark Was Entered and Exited Twice <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was in a state of hovering. It started to rise, then suddenly plummeted, and then recovered slightly. The 20,000 yuan mark was broken into and out of twice. Everyone's hearts were very distracted. The struggle between supply and demand was quite fierce. Initially, following the trend of the end of last week, it rose to 21,300 yuan, but soon Hong Kong gangs Wei Xiang and Xiangxing Yongshi and Li sold, and Tianyuan and Decheng also competed to sell, so it fell. In the afternoon, it retreated to a low price of 19,850 yuan. Unexpectedly, a few banks suddenly made a strong advance by Dafeng Defu (a total of more than 3,000 taels were imported throughout the day), and finally recovered slightly, closing at 550 yuan. The total transaction for the day was 15,660 taels. Gold jewelry fell by 50 yuan to 1,070 yuan. The black market for silver has fallen below the listed price of 28 yuan to 26.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot goods fluctuate greatly.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the spot market was shrouded in buying, and the market price rose. The market opened at 9 o'clock and rose to 21,200 yuan, 350 yuan higher than the closing price in Shanghai last Saturday. Then, Decheng, Tianyuan, Mingfeng, and Dafeng bought in, raising it to 21,300 yuan. The Hong Kong gangs suddenly sold out. Xianghe, Shihe, Xiangxing, and Yongdai sold hard. Hesheng, Tianyuan, Hengji, and Shunyuan also had strong intentions to sell. The market price plummeted, falling into 21,000 yuan, falling more sharply, and falling by 950 yuan to 20,350 yuan. After 10:40, Xiangxing, Yongtian Yuan, and Defeng resumed their advance. Decheng and Dafeng also bought in, raising it to 20,700 yuan. Xiangxing, Yongtian Yuan, and Junlai sold hard, Jinbang Yifeng and Yongcheng Xianghe also dumped, plunging 530 yuan, losing to 20,170 yuan. Dafeng Ming made a strong advance to 20,500 yuan. Shunyuan, Chengda Hengji, and Yixiang and advanced again, retreating to 20,115 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 20,161 yuan. The market opened 50 yuan lower in the afternoon, at 10,100 yuan. Shunyuan and Xianghe sold hard, continuing to drop 250 yuan, retreating into 20,000 yuan, losing to 19,851 yuan. Defu Decheng Chengji made a strong advance, raising it to 12,200 yuan. Dingsheng Xiangxing, Yongtian Yiyuan, Xianghe, and Decheng Yongcheng sold, pushing it down to 19,900 yuan. Dafeng Defu made a huge advance, Tianyuan Gonghe Deda, etc. made a strong advance, and the price gradually rose by 450 yuan, rising to 20,350 yuan. At that time, Tianyuan sold out, and the closing price was 20,300 yuan, which was 550 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday afternoon. After the closing, it rose to 20,400 yuan. The whole day had a difference of 1,450 yuan. The market price of the company's gold was 20,500 yuan, and the purchase price was about 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Jewelry and silver fell together.</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver jewelry in the morning was 70 yuan lower twice, at 2,050 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose by 20 yuan and hung up again, at 2,070 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), closing at 50 yuan. Silver still hung at 28 yuan, but the black market was as low as 26.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Need for the Black Market Is Not Strong <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the exchange rates of HSBC and Central did not change. The exchange rates of British and American small counters were fixed. The British and American exchange rates in the black market were still stable. A certain Chinese merchant speculator sold American exchange and still raised the price by 2.75 yuan, and some even shouted only 2.625 yuan. Importers are not in a hurry, because the daily price is too expensive. Therefore, the buyer's counter-offer is still around 3 yuan, and the trend is soft. The British gold and silver businesses cannot necessarily close. The trend was more stable in the afternoon. There were still no transactions at 4 o'clock. The closing price of British exchange was 2 pennies, and the closing price of American exchange was 3 yuan, which seemed to be slightly softer than the price last Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th (Monday): The exchange market opened smoothly this morning, and there were no changes in any exchange rates.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 10th (Monday): The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer was extended by 1.25 to 2 pennies 1.25.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds fell by 10 yuan each along with the cash price. British gold bills gradually stabilized, and the market price stabilized.

Hong Kong transparent bills continued to decline, and the evening market retreated to 8 yuan. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills fell sharply, both retreating to 3.9 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Rumors Are Negative; Cotton Yarn Hits the Limit <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market turned downwards, and the decline intensified. This was due to the rumor that the U.S. military might withdraw, which made people feel weak, and the shorts were active. Sellers came again enthusiastically, so the market followed downwards. As for spot yarn trading, in view of the decline in futures, the momentum was weakened. The 20-count Shuangma factory single opened in the morning at 2,950 yuan, down 60 yuan from the previous day. After a while, it rose to 3,015 yuan. However, the exchange's futures yarn has resumed operation. After the standard yarn opened and rose, the second session turned down. As for the fact that Shuangma factory single miscellaneous brands can also be used for delivery, the market price softened, and the sellers increased, so it fell to 2,900 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, due to various rumors, all of which were negative, the decline was even stronger. The opening price was 2,880 yuan, and it fell straight to 2,790 yuan, announcing the limit down. It is estimated that the turnover in half a day was about 3,000 bales. Spot yarn also fell by 7, 8, or 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Jinshuangma futures market situation, the agricultural opening is not strong, and the market atmosphere is very dull. November was 2,850 yuan, down 60 yuan, December was 3,030 yuan, also down 35 yuan, and January was 3,70 yuan, closing down 50 yuan. After entering, with the gold market and factory orders rising once, the futures yarn also rose by 5 to 40 yuan. Then, various parties increased their selling pressure, and the selling momentum was strong again, so it fell straight down, and the closing price in the afternoon was 100 to 156 yuan lower. In the afternoon, people were panicking and becoming more and more tired. The first session opened with a disastrous limit down, with each month falling by more than 200 yuan. Its trend is in a fiery atmosphere, or it will take a revolving path. The list is shown below:</p>
<p>Month Nov Dec Jan Opening 280.0 300.0 3070.0 Highest 2890.0 3039.0 3070.0 Lowest 2710.0 2865.0 2920.0 Closing 2710.0 2865.0 1910.0 Compared to Fall 200.0 Fall 200.0 Fall 200.0</p>
<h3 id="e36">Why Bother With Public Bonds; It's Just Useless Worry <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Foreign stocks fell as expected. Public bonds in the dark market, yesterday's market was greatly affected by the rumors that the U.S. military would withdraw from Shanghai. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was as much as 1.56 yuan. The difference in Ding Zhong was even greater because of the lottery, which was nothing more than the shorts taking advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on prices to achieve their profits. Therefore, the opening price of Bing Zhong in the early morning was only 64 yuan, but this unacceptable price immediately caused a large number of purchases. The second price rose by more than half a yuan, and then broke through 5 yuan, which shows that people's hearts are unusually distracted, and it is difficult to grasp the rise and fall. Although the situation between Japan and the United States is extremely bad, no one can make a definite statement in these few days. Is it dark or bright? It will be clear in the near future. But since there is no problem with the fundamentals of public bonds, why bother with useless worries? In the morning, Yichang first opened the market for Bing Zhong at 4 yuan, and Tongshun Jiufeng took the opportunity to absorb it. Soon, it broke through 5 yuan. Xiexing Yuan and Renfeng also made large-scale replenishments. Senji Tongkang Yitai provided the supply. The market price was slightly less than a few corners as a result of the afternoon closing. In the afternoon, Tongshun Hongda Xiexing Yuan bought in, and Zhong Hu Heji Yitai Delong sold out. The market price has always been outside of 5 yuan, revolving with strength, and the result is slightly stronger than the afternoon closing. The market price is generally continued to be 2 or 3 corners to 4 and a half corners lower. Ding Zhong was more than 1.4 yuan lower due to the cancellation of the lottery rights. The total transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. The following is a brief table: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day Tongjia 720.40 72.00 72.40 Fall 0.20 Tongyi 67.40 67 20 67.35 Also 0.25 Tongbing 65.60 64.00 65.55 Also 0.30 Tongding 64.00 62.70 63.40 Also 1.40 Tongwu 65.45 64.60 65.3 Also 0.55</p>
<p>Stock trading, 100 shares of Guohua Bank stock were traded at a price of 105 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market in the Public Industry Exchange had great disturbances. The opening was due to the lack of good news overnight, and people's hearts were extremely weak. Industrial stocks fell sharply, and rubber stocks lost more than a limited amount. After the opening, buyers were crowded, and the market situation turned firm and brisk. Until the afternoon, rubber stocks not only rose beyond the previous week's closing price, but also almost all appeared at new highs. Among them, Langerzhi's trend was particularly outstanding.

<p>Domestically Produced Raincoat Fabric Is Popular</p>
<p>Raincoat fabric is selling well in Shanghai. All of them are due to the high prices, and the incoming raincoat fabric is expensive and in short supply, which has created a good opportunity for the popular sale of domestically produced raincoat fabric. Among the domestically produced raincoat materials, the most popular one is rainproof fabric, followed by double and single-layer adhesive yarn surfaces. Rongchang Defeilong brand yarn surface rain fabric is the most famous. The wholesale price of adhesive is 9.5 yuan per yard, and the wholesale price of single adhesive is 8.25 yuan per yard. Yousheng Jinxiong Lao brand rainproof fabric is the most popular, because it is light and does not leak water, firm and soft, not hard and heavy, has no glue odor and soda, and has recently added a trademark. All old clothes can be repaired and re-glued with the mark, and only a handling fee of 5 yuan is charged, so the reputation is more solid, and the number of seekers is even greater. The price remains stable, and it only sells for 8 yuan net. However, its products are getting better and better, and it will rise again to reach 10 yuan in the future.</p>

<p>The factory cloth market fell miserably because the exchange opened and the shorts dumped futures, causing the spot market to fall with it. White cloth fell by about 10 yuan, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic, falling by about 5 to 10 yuan. The lowest price of 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was 100 yuan, and then it rose back to 103 yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 14 yuan. The violent rise and fall are the same. The turnover in this street decreased, totaling more than 400 pieces.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was in a panic because the Public Works Department controlled foreign rice, and the hoarders were bound to panic and rush to sell. Therefore, the trend fell sharply.

<h3 id="e39">Stringent Rice Price Controls Implemented with Great Success Yesterday; Market Speculation Eliminated; Numerous Cases of Smuggling and Hiding Rice Discovered <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Rice warehouses guarded by merchant corps to prevent relocation. Territorial authorities approved land regulations, including details regarding salaries and supplies, on the 4th, authorizing the Shanghai Municipal Council to formulate regulations for managing commodity prices in the city. After a meeting on the 9th, it was decided to begin managing commodity prices in the city, starting with rice. Subsequently, the implementation of various robust measures was announced, commencing from dawn. Following this, the management of prices for other essential commodities, such as flour and cooking oil, would be announced sequentially. This blitz-like action has already achieved remarkable results yesterday. The price of rice at all rice shops and stalls throughout the city is capped at a maximum of $130. Rice merchants can no longer obtain illegal profits. Rice stored in various warehouses cannot be moved without permission. Rice market speculation has been completely eliminated. Prices of various coarse grains and bean oil have fallen uniformly. The Merchant Corps mobilized to guard the warehouses. The International Volunteer Corps' "O" Company was dispatched at 5:00 PM yesterday to the area north of the Suzhou Creek, where rice warehouses congregate. Armed merchant corps members were stationed at each warehouse and storage facility containing rice, preventing relocation and assisting the police authorities. From 5:00 PM yesterday to 5:00 AM this morning, "A" Company took over. It is understood that this measure by the authorities is intended to forcibly sell stockpiled rice on the market when necessary, to stabilize the food supply. To prevent rice profiteers from inciting unrest, all national contingents of the International Volunteer Corps, except the Japanese contingent, are on standby.</p>
<p>Rewards Offered for Reporting Hoarding</p>
<p>The authorities of both concessions hope that the public will cooperate closely with the emergency measures taken by the authorities. Retail purchases are still limited to one dou (eight kilograms), and intentional over-purchasing is prohibited to avoid penalties. The authorities earnestly request that residents within the concessions report any stockpiles of rice, including the names of the property owners. If the reports are verified, it is said that a certain amount of reward money will be given. According to an announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, the council welcomes citizens to report any cases of profiteering or hoarding of various goods subject to price controls announced by the council. Reports should be submitted in writing, with supporting evidence, and sent to Room 171, Price Control Office, Shanghai Municipal Council Office, 209 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Sets Up Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council established a foreign rice office on the third floor of the Union Building on Fuzhou Road, starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Numerous male and female staff members are assigned to manage the following matters separately: purchasing foreign rice for taxpayers in the Western Extra-Settlement Roads area; purchasing foreign rice for factories and companies; purchasing foreign rice for hospitals and schools; warehouse receipts; and rice transportation permits. The procedures for applying to purchase foreign rice at the office are as follows: an application form must be filled out and submitted to a staff member; after the application form is approved, it should be sent to the table marked "Shanghai Municipal Council Cashier", along with the cash payment; after payment, the application form should be sent to the table marked "Warehouse Receipts" to exchange for a warehouse receipt; after receiving the warehouse receipt, it should be sent to the counter marked "Police Department Rice Transportation Permit" to obtain a rice transportation permit; carry the warehouse receipt and rice transportation permit to the location indicated on the warehouse receipt to collect the rice. There are also several footnotes to supplement the above: the rice transportation permit must be kept; it must be shown to the patrol officers during transportation; lost warehouse receipts or rice transportation permits will not be reissued; purchases of foreign rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council must be made in cash, without exception. The office has approximately 30 staff members, overseen by Mr. Bence, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and is under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Grain Sub-Committee. The members of the committee are Messrs. Cronk, Powell, Hanawa, Macmillan, and Shanghai Municipal Council officials Ferry, Peterson, and Bence. It is reported that 1,500 people registered and 700 telephone inquiries were received, with 200 people making direct inquiries.</p>
<p>Inspections Find Hidden Rice; Numerous Arrests Made</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives in dozens of teams to intercept illegally transported rice on the streets. As a result, the total number of packages intercepted in both concessions yesterday reached over 200. The French Concession, particularly the McTyeire Police Station, made the most interceptions. In the International Settlement, some rice shops were found to be attempting to secretly transport rice to residents' homes. After the police station learned of this, they searched the homes and seized a considerable amount of rice. It is also reported that some rice shop employees have been arrested. The seized rice is said to be sold to citizens by the police station at a fair price. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency, while passing through North Zhejiang Road, saw that the rice shop next to the Nanyang Soap Factory outlet at the intersection of North Suzhou Road had hidden all its foreign and domestic rice and was selling Saigon broken rice instead. This is a clear violation of the regulations of the concession authorities and is a case of lip service but disobedience. It is reported that the authorities of both concessions, fearing that rice profiteers would not comply with the law and sell their stockpiled rice as much as possible, have specially dispatched undercover detectives to conduct on-site investigations in various districts. Any illegal behavior will be dealt with in accordance with orders, including being ordered to close down or deported. It is reported that yesterday, several rice shops, including Xingtai on Great Race Course Road, were found to be attempting to secretly transport stockpiled rice to other locations for profit. The owners of these shops were taken to the police station for investigation and punishment according to the law.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Should Promptly Announce Sources</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that all retail rice shops should post a notice at their entrances stating the names of the usual wholesale suppliers of rice, indicating from where each rice shop obtains its rice. According to a statement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office regarding the purchase of foreign rice from the council, all those who have previously submitted applications to the council requesting foreign rice should take note that the council cannot make a decision on these applications at present because they have not provided the detailed information required by the council. As for residents in the Extra-Settlement Roads area of Western Shanghai, as well as factories, companies, schools, and institutions within the concessions who wish to purchase foreign rice, they should send representatives to Room 703 of the council office to fill out an application form. The current price of Shanghai Municipal Council foreign rice is $165.10 per bag, and payment must be made in cash. Checks will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Are Domestic Rice Prices Limited and Transportation Prohibited?</p>
<p>Regarding the new measures of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association concerning the Municipal Council's management of rice, because the council's notice did not mention whether domestic rice prices would be limited or transportation prohibited, three members, Zhang Nianxuan, Qu Zhenhua, and Shi Hongxun, were specially delegated to visit Deputy Director Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday afternoon to request a statement from the council. Mr. Ho personally received them and agreed to find a solution. The representatives were very satisfied and left. They also reported to the members on the calm state of affairs.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Loses Over 50 Million</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice announcing the unified control of rice, the rice industry in the city suffered losses of 50 to 70 million yuan within 24 hours. This figure is calculated from the previous day's rice prices and the amount of rice in storage, and it is still a conservative estimate. The rice controlled by the rice industry involves over one million bags, purchased at prices ranging from $160 to $200 per shi (unit of dry measure). Now, they can only sell it at the Shanghai Municipal Council's stipulated price of $130 per shi. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that as a result of the council's actions,</p>
<p>The Bureau is Fully Prepared</p>
<p>If many rice shops close down, the public should not feel alarmed. The bureau has a sufficient supply of rice to meet the needs of the city. In addition, the bureau has a large quantity of foreign rice that can be transported from Hong Kong and Rangoon in the short term. The bureau is currently procuring rice from other places. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council will soon take the same control measures for other daily necessities, such as flour, grains, and cooking oil. The Shanghai International Volunteer Corps mobilized today to assist the police. It is reported that they will be deployed at any time to prevent any disturbances that may arise due to the Municipal Council's management of rice. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council has begun to find ways to control the price of flour in the city and is currently discussing methods to implement them within a few days. It is reported that the Importers Association, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Council, has prepared a detailed plan for its operations, which will be completed soon, in order to control the soaring retail prices and hoarding activities.</p>
<p>Collective Purchase and Unified Distribution of Rice. Yesterday, rice carts on various roads were frequently stopped and inspected. Those exceeding the limit were confiscated. The rice confiscated will be sold fairly. To facilitate the purchase of rice for residents, the authorities will establish a rice distribution agency to be responsible for distributing rice to stores or factories with a large number of employees for sale, so as to manage and prevent private transportation and hoarding under the pretext of collective purchases by guilds or organizations.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Hoarding of Liquid Fuels Prohibited and Punished; Fire Department Hopes for Public Assistance in Investigation <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Department, in view of the large number of illegal hoarders of kerosene, gasoline, and other dangerous liquids in Shanghai, which pose a serious fire hazard, has been making efforts to reduce the danger to life and property caused by such excessive hoarding. The department has repeatedly dispatched personnel to inspect places reported or suspected of storing such liquids and, after inspection, has sent letters of guidance or warning. When necessary, the department has filed lawsuits with the court to punish hoarders. According to the department's announcement, in the past three months, the following cases of storing various dangerous goods have been prosecuted:</p>
<p>For kerosene, personnel were dispatched for 76 inspections. 19 places were verbally warned, and written warnings were also required. 11 of them did not comply and were sued in court and charged with storing illegal items in violation of Article 35 of the Land Regulations and By-laws. As a result, all were convicted and fined between $20 and $25. For ethyl alcohol, the Fire Department must deal with the most volatile and dangerous substance, so the department decided to make every effort to close these factories. In July, August, and mid-September, the department inspected 13 ethyl alcohol factories that had already been identified. Several of them stopped work after being warned, but three did not follow the instructions. They were sued and fined, and the court ordered them to close down. For gasoline, there are two storage locations that have been investigated. Personnel were sent to inspect them, and one of them was sued and fined. In addition to the above-mentioned dangerous liquids, the use of celluloid in small hair comb, button, ornament, and bottle cap factories also kept the Fire Department busy. Most of these factories stopped work after receiving warnings. In the past three months, a total of 18 inspections were made on various factories, and four were given written warnings, ordering them to stop work. Three of them did not comply and were convicted by the court. Reports on the illegal storage of dangerous goods are welcomed by the Fire Department. The department also hopes that the public will report any known violations to help the department eliminate fire hazards.</p>

<p>It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council is now mobilizing all police officers to prevent fires within the concession. A special team has been organized and is ready to work with the Fire Department and the Public Works Department to search places reported to contain flammable materials based on the reports received. It is reported that in two days, 12 places where flammable materials were found were confiscated. A large quantity of kerosene, candles, and matches were found in one place. Mr. Chen, the owner of a tobacco shop at 347 Fuzhou Road, was found to have stored a large quantity of flammable materials and was arrested.

<p>Protecting Overseas Merchants for Over a Century</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps has been responsible for protecting the nationals, property, and commercial interests of the U.S. outside the American continent for over a century. The Fourth Regiment of the Marine Corps, since its formation on April 16, 1914, has been responsible for protecting overseas expatriates, which is more important than other regiments. It was first stationed in Mexico and Santo Domingo. In January 1927, the Fourth Regiment was ordered to be stationed in China. On February 24 of the same year, the regiment sailed into the Shanghai Mobil Oil Company dock on the Jia Meng ship. It was not until March 21 that the regiment moved into eight barracks in the International Settlement to carry out protection work together with foreign troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. At that time, the U.S. Marine Corps Third Brigade was established in Tianjin, and the Fourth Regiment was incorporated into the brigade. The Second Battalion departed from San Diego on April 12, 1927, and was stationed in Tianjin, becoming part of the Twelfth Regiment. On January 29, 1929, the Third Brigade was disbanded, and all the U.S. troops, except the Fourth Regiment, returned to the U.S. in February of the following year. The Fourth Regiment was then formed by merging two battalions.</p>
<p>A Brigade Added During the Shanghai Battle</p>
<p>In December 1937, the Shanghai Battle broke out. At the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Second Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps came to Shanghai to increase defense. The Fourth Regiment was incorporated into the brigade. On February 18 of the following year, the Second Brigade, together with the Sixth Regiment and the Anti-Aircraft Artillery, withdrew from China, leaving only the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai to protect U.S. expatriates and property in difficult circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Christian Expanded Evangelistic Week <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has grown to five or six million, and a considerable number of Christians have also come here from other places to seek refuge. In total, there are no fewer than twenty thousand. Non-Christians account for 97 percent, which is similar to the situation between the ancient Roman Empire and the Christians of the first century in European history. Now, because outstanding Taoist masters have returned from overseas one after another, various church groups, seeing the rampant speculation, widespread evil, and insatiable greed, with the wealth of these people increasing daily as they indulge in extravagance and debauchery with their ill-gotten gains, while the salaried class is struggling on the brink of death under economic oppression, and the people are drowning in misery to such an extreme, in order to save the world and spread the Gospel, the Shanghai Christian Evangelistic Group, the Shanghai Christian Missionary Association, the Shanghai Christian Endeavor Society, Bethel Theological Seminary, and the Gan's Holy Apostles' College have jointly launched an expanded evangelistic week in Shanghai. First, an executive committee was organized, and Rev. Zhu Guishen, Zhu Chonghua, Yu Zhizhai, Tang Renxi, Ji Zhiwen, and Lin Daoliang, as well as Mr. Le Junying, were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the committee. General affairs, literature, economy, evangelism, and inspection groups were established, with staff responsible for preparations and implementation. Since the first meeting was convened on October 15, a discussion meeting on the program of the great evangelistic week has been held every Wednesday afternoon at 5 o'clock at Moore Memorial Church. The following items have been decided:</p>
<p>The evangelistic locations are divided into four places: Moore Memorial Church on Nanchang Road, Tian'an Church on Shandong Road, St. Paul's Church in the Foreign Cemetery on Sanma Road, and the Chinese Christian Church on Kangtuo Road, which are open to the public.</p>
<p>The dates and times for evangelism have been set from November 10 (Monday) to the 16th, for a total of one week, from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every night. At the same time, evangelists will also broadcast sermons on the Gospel Radio Station.</p>
<p>Speakers: The original speakers for this expanded evangelistic week were Rev. Ji Zhiwen, Zhao Shiguang, Qi Qingcai, and Lin Daoliang. However, Rev. Ji and Lin have recently returned from the United States, and Rev. Zhao has also returned to Shanghai from Java in Southeast Asia. Now Rev. Zhao has gone to Hong Kong to preach, and Rev. Qi must go to Hao County in Anhui Province on the 11th to lead a revival meeting. Therefore, the evangelism group had to redistribute the speakers. Rev. Lin Daoliang will speak at Tian'an Church, Rev. Gu Lisi and Mr. Zhang Jianguo, who have returned to Shanghai from the inland and the Philippines, will be specially invited to speak at St. Paul's Church, Rev. Wang Feixiang and Mr. Qian Tuyun will speak at the Chinese Christian Church, and members of the [missing word] Workers' Society will speak on the 5th. Rev. Zhao can rush back on the 6th and 7th days and will be invited to speak.</p>
<p>Distributing tracts: A total of 140,000 tracts will be distributed, with 30,000 donated by the Bethel Church. The remaining 110,000 have been rushed to the printers. The words are simple and clear, and the front is a specially compiled hymn. The members of the evangelistic group are responsible for the distribution. On the 15th, male and female students from various church schools will be responsible for distribution. Approximately, members of the evangelistic group will distribute these tracts on trams, buses, and major roads starting from the 10th.</p>
<p>Publishing cover advertisements: The intention is to make all newspaper readers in the city aware that the Christian Church is holding a great evangelistic event. The cost of cover advertisements is very high, requiring several thousand yuan per day. However, the "News Daily" has been donated by the youth fellowship of Tian'an Church, and the "Shen Bao" has been donated by a pharmacist from a certain pharmaceutical factory. Other enthusiastic believers have also contributed to publishing in the "China-U.S. Daily" and other newspapers. He Ming Shoe and Hat Store has even donated a movie advertisement.</p>
<p>Bible verses: These are divided into four types. The largest type will be posted on the windows of buses and major stores, the second type will be posted on trams in the Public Concession, and the third and fourth types can be posted on private cars and chartered cars. These slogans are decorated with a cross and very clear Bible verses, which are colorful and beautiful. This initiative is due to the promotion of Dr. Minsde, the American director of the Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and also thanks to the sponsorship of the Public Concession Tram and Bus Company, which is not charging a penny. It is said that tens of thousands of copies of these slogans, large and small, have been printed, which is a huge expense.</p>
<p>Gospel car: During the evangelistic week, it is planned to parade the Public Concession with the car, which will be decorated with large white flags and pasted with slogans. There will be a choir and a band in the car. When it arrives in bustling urban areas, they will get out of the car to distribute tracts. When the car starts, the choir will sing hymns and the band will play music. It is also planned to rent a large car in the French Concession and hold the same event.</p>
<p>Reception and loudspeaker arrangements: Tian'an Church, St. Paul's Church, and the Chinese Christian Church will be taken care of by the pastors of each church, and enthusiastic believers will serve as ushers.

<p>At the Shuntai Warehouse on Gongping Road, Hongkou, at around 4 PM yesterday, a large shipment of rice suddenly arrived. A considerable number of coolies, numbering dozens, were hired to carry the rice into the warehouse for storage. However, due to the excessive height of the stacking, the rice suddenly collapsed, injuring eight coolies. People called for cars to transport the eight injured workers to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Xu Daoxiang, aged 42, who was sent to Tongren Hospital, suffered broken legs and internal injuries and his life is in danger. The others also suffered serious injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Rice Shop Owner Arrested for Hoarding Rice with Thai Rice Shop <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Xingtai Rice Shop at 263 Rue Sainte Marie, French Concession, was opened by Ling Dechang, a native of Nantong, about half a year ago. Yesterday morning at around 8 AM, Ling, due to the recent strict investigations by the French authorities, colluded with accomplices to take advantage of the situation to smuggle 20 bags of top-grade Xian rice out of the back door of the shop in Houde Lane, intending to hoard them in a certain house in Houde Lane. Unexpectedly, the plan was not secret and was discovered by the patrol officer stationed at the shop, who immediately detained them and reported to the Lujiazui Police Station by telephone. The police station immediately sent detectives to investigate and seized the original 20 bags of Xian rice. The owner of the Xingtai Rice Shop and the resident of the house in Houde Lane where the rice was hidden were both arrested and taken to the police station for detention and investigation. It is heard that the French police station has recently stationed two patrol officers at each rice shop to investigate whether there is any hoarding or malpractice. Therefore, several illegal rice shops have been investigated in recent days and are now being interrogated separately.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Rapid Progress in Education at All Levels in Guangxi Province <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Director of Education of Su Province Makes a Statement (Guilin Correspondence) A reporter recently met with Su Xiyun, Director of the Department of Education of Guangxi Province, and asked about the situation of education at all levels in Guangxi Province this year. He was informed as follows: 1. Elementary Education: Elementary education in Guangxi Province is extremely developed. On average, every county and village has a basic school. The number of schools is the highest in the country. According to statistics, the number of school-age children enrolled in schools in the province accounts for more than 80% of the total. However, due to insufficient funding for each school, low teacher salaries, and simple school equipment, student achievement is affected. Therefore, it is planned to improve these aspects in the future. 2. Secondary Education: Secondary education has also been extremely developed in recent years. Last year (1940), the number of secondary school students in the province was 37,000. This year, it has increased to more than 51,000. The increase in the number of students means that the original schools are not enough to accommodate them, so there was a so-called "school shortage," that is, students found it difficult to find a school to attend. This autumn, private schools have also increased the number of classes as much as possible. This difficulty has been resolved. The Department of Education also pays close attention to various private schools, fearing that poor management will delay students' studies. 3. Normal Education: At present, elementary schools in this province feel a lack of teachers. This is not because there are not enough teachers, but because the salaries of elementary school teachers are meager, and graduates of normal schools are changing careers. There are currently seven normal schools and one special teacher training institute in this province. It is planned to add another normal school in the next year (1942) to train teachers. At the same time, attention will be paid to the work of "retaining teachers," that is, trying to improve teachers' salaries so that they can work with peace of mind. This will prevent teachers from being restless and causing a shortage of teachers. 4. Adult Education: This province designated 1939 as Adult Education Year, stipulating that adults aged 18 to 40 must receive civic education. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. Adults in the province who have received civic education account for more than 91% of the total. However, due to manpower and financial resources, the education time seems to be too short. It is planned to retrain adults who have already received civic training for two months to enable them to have a considerable understanding of the country and the nation and to generate great power for the war of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Implementation of the Micro-Marriage System <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Liao</p>
<p>Ms. Fulei, who has been working at a marriage agency for many years, said to a group of students studying marriage problems: "Many people suggest that there should no longer be the pretense of an introducer in the wedding program from now on; they even think that having the introducer's signature on the marriage certificate is an insult to their sacredness..." This group of extremists shouted, "Don't allow the fly feet of the introducer to stain the pure marriage!"</p>
<p>Indeed, it is true. Nowadays, in the process of young Americans getting together, it is rare to go through a specially designated introducer. They will boldly publicly seek marriage partners in newspapers and magazines and get their objects. This trend is advancing day by day. According to the statistics of a pastor who often performs weddings, it almost accounts for more than 22 percent. There is no other reason for this, it is the change in the marriage psychology of young people, because everyone feels that automatically exploring a spouse is more meaningful.</p>
<p>Except for a few failures, their success has indeed painted a bright color in the history of marriage! Most of them can get a happy spouse and establish a happy family. Today, it seems that everyone believes that the best introducer is still themselves.</p>
<p>Public micro-marriage, as long as you can grasp the center, is a very good system. It will give you an unexpected harvest, just like Columbus got the New World! You may not have a spouse, among classmates, among friends, among neighbors, among relatives; but I believe that there is no spouse in this world that belongs to you. Perhaps a handsome young man fishing by the sea thousands of miles away will be your ideal husband!</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of micro-marriage is that it is broad and universal, so you can reduce the regret of "omission."</p>
<p>However, everyone should pay attention to: it needs a more calm head and a more cautious attitude to deal with. Otherwise, you will see that there are too many heroes and beauties in the world, making it impossible for you to choose.</p>
<p>The biggest condition for preparing to seek marriage is honesty. Don't exaggerate yourself as the number one person in the world. At best, you can learn from the marriage advertisement written by Mr. Jin Tang:</p>
<p>"Jin Tang, an Indian mixed race, 28 years old, dropped out of middle school one semester short. Now working as a receptionist at the International Apartment. Fills in as a servant in the Gentleman's Cafeteria at lunchtime, and as an attendant at the No-Ending Electric City broadcaster on Saturday nights. Holds a National Bank Type A Special Convenience Savings Deposit Passbook with a balance of 394 yuan and 74 percent (interest not yet included). Has a positive personality, thick-skinned, weighs 140 pounds, and has a certificate signed by Dr. Fuke proving that he has no venereal disease. If there is a Miss who is tired of the taste of Miss and can get used to living in a small room, please come to 16 Sheep Dormitory in person on Sunday morning for a face-to-face meeting."</p>
<p>Please don't laugh at this frank advertisement. He has already found a beautiful and virtuous partner. Their home is still praised as the "Home of Happiness"!</p>
<p>I [missing word] Our newspapers are now beginning to see some "micro-marriage" type things. We strongly agree with this principle, but at the same time, we solemnly say, don't treat it as a joke! Many [missing word] budding seedlings only allow us to cultivate, not to destroy! If we can promote the micro-marriage system in a regulated manner, with the breadth of our country's territory and the size of the population, who says this is not a matter of increasing happiness? At least, the number of single men and unmarried women will be reduced a little!</p>

<h3 id="e68">Atomic Fission and Lawrence <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Jiajun</p>
<p>One evening twelve years ago, the University of California [missing text] second vacuum tube, and countless electrical points were quickly fired from the tube to the other end. The simple device was the first model used to impact atoms.</p>
<p>An assistant said to the professor: "Mr. Lawrence, the power is too small, I'm afraid it won't be able to break the atom." Lawrence nodded. He then managed ten vacuum tubes, using copper as the poles and a large magnet in the middle. When the current passed through, the thunderbolt flew at high speed from one pole to the other, and the magnet sucked the electricity into a solid spiral speedometer, recording an extremely high rate of flight. "Success!" He cheered excitedly.</p>
<p>In 1939, Lawrence won the Nobel Prize in Physics because he was the first person in the world to split the atom. But he still doesn't think he is satisfied. He is now rushing to build a shooter that is twenty times larger than the original one, preparing to use the energy released by the atom due to fission as the driving force for industry.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, scientists all thought that atoms were indivisible small particles. Now everyone understands that each atom is like the solar system, with a nucleus in the middle and electrons orbiting it endlessly. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. All substances are composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons, but the arrangement is different. If one million atoms were arranged in a row, they would only fill the gap between the point and stroke of the English letter [missing word], and the degree of its smallness can be imagined. But the position of the nucleus in the atom is like a fly in the hall. Protons and neutrons are combined and wrapped in the nucleus with great force. If you want to split it, of course you need extremely large power, so Lawrence's [missing word] initial shooter used an electromotive force of one million volts.</p>
<p>Now ordinary shooting instruments also have a rate of 18,000 miles per second, which is 35,000 times faster than a rifle bullet. When sodium atoms are shot, they become magnetic because the 11 outer electrons are supplied by heavy hydrogen and increase to 12. Electron shooting can also transform aluminum into phosphorus, nitrogen into boron, and can also have temporary radioactivity, a property previously unique to radium and its related elements.</p>
<p>After being shot, atoms of several elements can release neutron light, which doctors have used to treat tumors in humans and other animals. It is said to be very effective. Thanks to Lawrence's invention, zoologists are studying the growth and metabolism of animals, and botanists can understand how green plants make starch from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. In industry, radioactive hydrogen can refine petroleum, and radioactive chlorine can also detect whether the steel plates inside warships are dense or not. According to recent research, uranium can release 50 million times more heat than carbon when split.</p>
<p>There are 37 atomic shooting instruments in the world. The largest shooting machine in the United States designed by Lawrence has a magnet weighing 4,900 tons. The total cost is 1.4 million US dollars. It took three years to complete and requires an electromotive force of 100 million volts. When the experiment is in progress, even the control room deep underground at 150 feet will feel a violent tremor.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Fireproof Cotton <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yongyun</p>
<p>Fireproof cotton is a cheap, lightweight, and durable insulator, suitable for everyday household use, and when used as a decoration on Christmas trees, it poses no danger. Its manufacturing process involves "wrapping" the cotton fibers with crystals of a substance that makes the fibers non-flammable. The exact details are unknown to outsiders. Someone placed a hinge nail heated to 1500 degrees into two pounds of fireproof cotton. As a result, after the hinge nail cooled, the cotton showed no change, except for a weight loss of five percent. However, a direct torch can pierce this coarse cotton, but there is no flame, so the fire will not spread, as shown in the figure.</p>

<p>Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero</p>
<p>Begonia was already modest by nature. Now that he has reached a point where he has no choice but to make a living as a "tumbling insect" in Shanghai, he is naturally even more careful when he meets people. Although the martial arts supervisor didn't know his background, he couldn't help but say a few words in his favor when introducing him on account of the young boss. At the same time, Begonia himself clasped his hands and bowed, saying many insider words. Therefore, after going around in a circle, the impression was very good, and everyone got along with him very well, with no intention of looking down on him.</p>
<p>However, in reality, how can the relationship between people be so simple?</p>
<p>"Please put your clothes over there. We martial arts practitioners must abide by some martial arts rules!" He took off his tattered outer jacket and was about to hang it on a row of clothes hooks nailed to the partition wall when a very loud voice suddenly rang out behind him.</p>
<p>He hurriedly retracted his hand and turned his head in alarm.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, standing in front of him was the martial arts leader whom the martial arts supervisor had just introduced to him, repeatedly requesting him to take care of him. This gentleman's height was probably at least a head taller than Begonia. His round face, sweeping eyebrows, and a pair of goldfish eyes protruding about three or four fen beyond his eyelids already made him intimidating enough! What's more, at this time, his face showed a kind of indescribable strangeness, which naturally made Begonia panic even more! (259)</p>

<p>Since New York Mayor La Guardia actively promoted aid to China, the "One Bowl of Rice" movement has spread to various parts of the United States. Not only is there spiritual support, but the enthusiasm for donations is also very fervent. The stars of the eight major Hollywood companies dare not show weakness. Although their donations are not a large sum, their enthusiasm cannot be buried. The first was the romantic young man Mickey Rooney. He remembered, on a rainy morning, putting thirty US dollars in a silver-plated box and personally delivering it to New York City Hall in the rain (he came from Hollywood to attend a friend's wedding that day). After the mayor came out to greet this sudden visitor, Mickey Rooney took out the small box and said it was to help Chinese refugees. In addition to thanking him as usual, the mayor also shared breakfast with him in the dining room.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple, of great fame, after finishing filming "The Blue Bird" last year, wrote a "My Autobiography" herself, which was published by the New York Life Bookstore. It sells more than 10,000 copies every month. Because she knows that she has a large audience in China who welcome her, she took 31 percent of the September royalties from this "My Autobiography" and donated it to the American Red Cross as a fund for aid to China.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese photographer named Hu Di at Warner Bros. He also completely dedicated the remuneration from his recently completed film to the American Red Cross to purchase wheat and donate it to Chinese refugees.</p>
<p>Qin Qiu Zha Jisi also initiated a proposal for an impromptu donation to Chinese and English refugees at a company party. With one person starting, everyone responded, and more than two hundred yuan were raised.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in the United States will hold a banquet to thank the Hollywood stars for their aid to China in order to reward their sincerity.</p>

<p>Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," performed by the Shanghai Professional Theatre Troupe at the Carlton Theatre, has been going on for a month, and the audience has been no less than 35,000 people. Because "Metamorphosis" is full of the positiveness of the present era, which is in line with the audience's spiritual food, the box office success has never waned. For example, on a recent Sunday, even the early show sold more than 5,500 yuan, setting a record for the box office of spoken drama. Therefore, the "Professional" authorities are preparing to continue performing for another month in order to further expand the audience's scope.</p>
<p>During the performance of "Metamorphosis," an interesting anecdote occurred a few days ago: After the performance that day, three young ladies of the intellectual class rushed to the backstage. Very emotionally, they hugged Yan Fei, who played [Dr. Ding], and then dragged her out. It turned out that their purpose was to invite [Dr. Ding] to a late-night meal. Yan Fei, unable to refuse the hospitality, went with them to Gongdelin, across from the back door of the Carlton Theatre. For a time, the actors in the [Professional] laughed:</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk – Tartar Cavalry, Dust Fills the City</p>
<p>But after I came back, I heard Fang Xiting say: [This is just an expedient measure for the time being, temporarily borrowing the strength of others. After defeating the bandits, General Wu will still be loyal to the Ming Dynasty and will never cooperate with the Qing court.] Zhang Cangqiu said: [I'm not sure he will be able to do so.] Xu Jing said: [In any case, this is always a misjudgment on the General's part. Although future events are unpredictable, this approach is tantamount to planting the seeds of disaster in advance. Think about it, can there be such a kind and righteous person in the world who does not seize our land but is willing to help us quell internal strife? Alas! General Wu only cares about the present and does not think about the future. Is this the behavior of a hero? That's why Zhang Big Brother and I have to leave.] Chai Ying said: [I sympathize with what you all said. However, since General Wu has already done it, we cannot undo it for the time being, but only seek ways to remedy it. Therefore, I do not want you to leave General Wu like this. I have come here specifically to persuade you to return with me and not to leave him for the time being. When General Wu borrows Qing troops, recaptures Yanjing, and drives out the bandit, we will help General Wu to devote all our efforts to resist the Qing people and prevent them from occupying an inch of our land within the pass. If, at that time, General Wu still has hesitant intentions, let alone you want to leave, even I, Chai, would not want to be indirectly driven by foreign races under his command. Then we might as well think of other ways to benefit the country. I hope you will understand what I have said. It is not for General Wu's personal gain, but really for the sake of the country that I am persuading you not to leave completely. Let's all stay together, quell the bandits together, and wait and see what happens. General Wu has read poetry and books, so he will probably not become a tool of the Tartars and forget his motherland.] (125)</p>
