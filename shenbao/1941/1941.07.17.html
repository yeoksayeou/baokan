<p>社評</p>
<h3>遠東反侵略陣綫問題</h3>
<p>蘇德開戰以來的廿餘日間，在歐洲大陸和大西洋兩岸都引起了若干新的事態，使世人觀感爲之一變；獨有遠東一隅，本來意識着會要發生變動的，却反而保持着相當的寗靜。這種寗靜，自然任何人都能看出是建立在極不安定的平衡之上，是若干因素的互相錯綜和批觸使慣於乘火打刧者流也不得不審愼將事，靜伺形勢的推移；同時，不消說，其間任何一個因素的變動都會影響到全局，使髯靜變成了鼎沸。</p>
<p>這一局面自然最適於綏靖政策的滋生，以是日前關於遠東綏靖政策的種種疑懼，即使不盡有事實上的根據，揆以杜漸防微之義，要屬未容厚非。不過今日遠東局勢之絕非綏靖政策所能奏效，原極明顯，在累决苦的敎訓之餘，即在最低能的政治家也再不敢把前途安危寄託在綏靖政策的期望上面；至多不過是在實力未充抑或勢難兼顧之際以懷柔手段暫事周旋以俟準備的完成而已。最近蘇聯西疆鏖戰方酣，突又宣佈日本海及鄂霍决克海爲危險區域；美國則延長兵役案方在國會爭論之中，復向國會請求七千餘萬美元巨款用充太平洋海軍根據地建築經費，都可以看出雙方對於遠東未來事態戒備的一斑。美國之竭力在太平洋增强防務原爲數年來的一貫政策，而此度提案中「美國重要前綫尙在太平洋」一語。却恰是針對着那種把援英視爲急於一切的成見。至於蘇聯之劃定遠東海上危險區域，自然是戰時國家應有的措施，但所謂保護海參崴之航行者，其實所有從那裏到太平洋的航路，無不要通過日本的領海；姑不論太平洋上至今迄無德國潛艇出現，假使其眞將危及海參崴的航路，亦非以日本海港爲根據地不爲功，格於蘇日中立協定第二條的規定，在日方尙宣言遵守該的義務之際，那顯然是不可能的事。蘇聯不從對日條的中覓取海參崴出海通路的安全，而出於埋置水雷的武裝措置，如果說只是爲了防範德國潛艇活動，顯近於無的放矢。最近日本方面對於此一事件之特予宣揚，其具何用意及反應姑不置論。在蘇聯方面，這即使不能驟即斷爲蘇當局對於條的效力之缺乏信任，至低限度亦當與其若干大軍之始終留駐東疆同一用意。</p>
<p>現在歐洲方面，英蘇之間己以同盟形式駢肩作戰，實現了若干年來世人的理想要求，而在遠東方面，這種方式也許在目前尙不能完全適用；因爲遠東戰爭之於歐戰，只是在反侵略意義上相合流，此外則各自具有其特殊之目標與對象，在局勢尙無進一步的發展以前，這一點是不容驟予抹煞的。此種奇異之存在，自然也就是日前所傳遠東綏靖政策發生的根源，但却絕不能成爲有力的理由，因爲這兩組戰爭另自有其反侵略的共同點存在，對於任何侵略者的放鬆或讓步都是整個反侵略戰爭的損失，以是各個爲了反侵略而從事有形無形戰爭的國家，必須根據其本身立塲互爲密切的合作。但在今日的遠東，中美英蘇各個反侵略國家之間只有個別的合作，而缺乏整個相互的協調動作。各國實力固然互有盈肭，然而尺有所短，寸有所長，單獨應變或有未足，共謀對付則必能戡亂；與其倚恃不盡可靠的條的，尙未完成的防務，以致貽誤事機，何如相互配合共作有效的措施，中美英蘇之在遠東，固然不能與英蘇的同盟作戰同日而語，但其相互合作的程度亦應與英美蘇聯之於歐洲相差不致過遠。</p>
<p>所謂觀望政策絕不是靜止不動，其另一面則為加緊完成必要準備以俟有利的時機。最近的遠東局而正在明朗化的途徑中，並無悲觀的理由，只是以言預防未來禍變的發生，尙有未達一間的地方。在這一點上，中國在最近的將來必能有最可滿意的表現，而在其他關係列強則尙應加以鄭重的進一步考慮。</p>
<h3>美總統發表言論　堅主修改入伍法</h3>
<p>遴選兵額限制亦應取銷</p>
<p>否則有引起「悲劇」可能</p>
<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電　羅斯幅總統昨在新聞記者席上、論及修改入伍法案時稱、該法案如不予以修改、則美國之陸軍（總統認爲美國陸軍乃世界上最小者）勢有迅速腐化之虞、因其中員額　分之二即將返歸田園不得不由新軍補充也、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨對新聞記者稱、美國遴選軍役法原有但書、規定遴選兵得因國會之宜布國家緊急狀態或因此法之修改而延長其役期、兵士之服役一年者、受此條文之拘束、故國會展長遴選兵與國防兵之役期、並不爲背信、渠以爲、陸軍應吾崩解、此爲目前所應決定之簡單問題、而此決定、今繫於國會云、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　美陸軍參謀長馬歇爾、七月九日對參院軍事委員會陳述意見、贊成立法展長國防兵等一年役期時曾稱、本應以受有特殊訓練之軍隊往駐冰島、以代陸戰隊、但此舉未克實現、因爲一年役期之規定所梗也、苟一年期限不予撤銷、則美國現有已受訓練之軍隊、大都將銷滅於無形、渠未有計畫遠征軍之意、惟羅斯福總統國家緊急狀態之宣布、不可不注意、渠個人以爲、爲公共利益計、國會實有宣布國家緊念狀態存在之必要云、</p>
<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電　美國陸軍參謀長馬歇爾將軍、向參議院軍事委員會宣稱、如不能使入伍人員及國防軍之服務年限超過原來之一年時期、容有成爲「全國悲劇」之結果、據云、馬歇爾將車之言論、乃於該委員會之執行會議中所發表者、渠又言、「鑒於國際狀况及對吾國威脅之迅速增加、余以爲如以純粹理論爲根據、卽將吾國三分之二受有訓練之軍人及四分之三受有訓練之軍官於此時作實際之解散及復員、則極有引起全國悲成果之可能」、　指出入伍人員服役法案、可使軍士需於全國緊急之時、渠言、「按陸軍部之意見、緊念狀熊現已存在」、又言、現有之法律不許派遣軍隊援助佔領冰島之舉、並鑒於後備軍役年內卽將滿期、必須要求該項軍士之同意延長、又云、「此項宣布之結果、一艘以上之遠征戰艦或將被擊沉」、昨日馬歇爾將軍並請求國會給予較廣之權力、得便宜行事、將不適宜之軍官解職、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電　美陸次彼得遜咋函知衆院議長雷本、正式聲稱、羅斯福總統贊成將國防兵、遴遴兵　後備軍之留役期限　長至原定一年之外、總統並欲取銷遴選兵額九十萬人之限制、彼得遜並稱、德國自奧至俄無役不勝、其所以然者、因有關係國家未作防禦侵略之適當　備也、德國每役以人數極衆之大軍攻　、未有凖備之軍隊、吾人殊不能以國家安全爲嘗試、觀於過去數月之事件、今日而使陸軍復員、直自招禍耳云、</p>
<p>國際社十六口華盛頓電　衆院度支委員會昨透露、待決之四·七七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元陸軍經費案、可供給配備完全之陸軍三百萬、的爲現在兵力之二倍、陸軍高級人員謂、此款將用以購置各種設備、小件軍器、服裝　個人用品、以及機槍等等、並指稱、彼等固知目下不無需如許兵力、但此項凖備對於敵人將有心理上之影響、一年以後、美陸軍之兵力、卽可與歐洲各主要軍隊、一決雌　矣、</p>
<h3>菲島兩海灣　宣布為海軍區</h3>

<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電　軍事專家稱、海軍部之重視菲島防禦、於美·菲關係上及美國在遠東之軍事地位上、均屬非常重要、總統要求撥款在卡維德建造一作値美金五·五七〇·〇〇〇元之空軍根據、未會遭受多數反對、惟孤立派中對此一問題有若干反對之暗示耳、</p>

<h3>西南的生產建設</h3>
<p>— 巴雨</p>
<p>（本報重慶航訊）內地不像都市那樣繁華，更不像都市那樣消費，內地在刻苦建設着，在埋頭改進着，生長的種子，到處在播種，遂漸的在培養中，在收穫中，川省的蠶絲，桂省的桐油，黔湘等省的農產水利，都在積極從事增產。這些這些，都是　覺消費者的號角，現在將各省經濟建設最近進行中的事業，分別記在下面：</p>
<p>四川有一百縣適宜養蠶種桑</p>
<p>川省蠶絲產量，戰前佔全國蠶絲產量百分之十三·九。全川適宜蠶桑縣分，達一百縣以上，以川北爲主，據川絲整理會調查佔計蠶　產量，每年約四五十萬担，近二年來，積極改進計設有川絲整理會，四川絲業公司，四川農業改進所，蠶絲試騐所，蠶桑推廣會，川南桑葉研究室，川東榨蠶試騐區等，專事蠶桑改進生產運銷，頗具成績。惟統制方法，尙須調整之處甚多。此外川省府正籌設若干示範工廠，以改良農具爲目的，資本定二百五卜萬。</p>
<p>煤鐵金銀銅錫雲南遍地皆是</p>
<p>雲南省富於鑛產，如煤·鐵·金·銀·銅·錫·鵭·鋅等鑛，幾於遍地皆是，鹽巖亦極充足。現滇省府已成立滇西企業局，雲南鑛業公司，水泥廠等，對於採金除已探查鑛苗外，正局部開發中。此外，並在龍陵，保山，芒市交通綫之間，設立迤西熱帶作物試騐總塲。在保山，昌寗之枯河壩，設立桐林塲。</p>
<p>桂省着意農產漫山遍野桐花</p>
<p>桂省對農業生產，本年規定須增產糧食二百二十四萬一千担，已擬定實施辦法，至爲詳晰。該省原爲提倡植桐最力者，且曾規定桐花爲省花，每年四月一日爲桐花節。凡曾足履桂省，於風和日麗之日，只見漫山遍野，盡屬桐花。全省植桐而積，達一百萬畝，生產量至少在五十萬市担左右，現省府決定於五年內擴充油桐栽培面積一百五十萬畝。</p>
<p>耒陽自製火柴平壩設立農塲</p>
<p>湘省對于農業建設，除注重植桐外，邵陽一帶，原爲栽種非稻作物，如辣椒，甘蔗，烟草，均已禁種，改種秈稻。工業方面，火柴廠已在耒陽開工。省府幷以六十萬元恢復造紙廠，設立醫用藥品器材製材廠。黔省府近亦會同農林部決定在平壩設立國營貴州農塲，初期開辦費定爲四十萬元，以期將黔省農業，遂漸改進。</p>
<p>粵省各種工廠在大量復興中</p>
<p>粤省現正復興各工廠，計恢復者，有機器製造修理廠，肥皂廠，藥棉廠，製紙示範廠，酒精廠，煉鐵廠等。曲江，樂昌，南雄，始興一帶之民營工廠，如榨油廠，製紙廠，紡織廠等，亦均增加生產。至于農業，粤省原爲氣候溫和，土地肥沃之區，故對糧食增產，正積極推進，成績尙佳。</p>
<p>灰土代替水泥成績異常美滿</p>
<p>內地對于水泥之需要，至爲迫切，現在已發明灰土代水泥，其主要成分爲陶粉及消石灰，原料爲黏土與石灰石，二者經分別加燒後，一則磨碾成粉，一則加水消散。製造方法先選定黏土之品質，即建窰黏土加燒，將燒好之黏土先碎爲陶礫，再磨成粉，消石灰亦用同樣方法將石灰燒成後，加相當十三分之一至二分之一之水，再用機力拌和爲消石灰，消石灰入倉伏置十日後自成適當細度之粉末，再將兩種原料磨成粉後，加以配合，即成爲代水泥。其優點如抗壓强度與水泥同爲二十八天，最後壓力與水泥同，現各地均在批廣製造，成績堪稱滿意。</p>

<h3>改善中國運輸機構　美接濟品將暢達　專家技師先後來華工作　增進效能可望早日勝利</h3>
<p>美國對ABC陣綫之中國、作澈底援助、並爲加强站在太平洋前哨作戰機構起見、除作物資之援助外、更將中國列入和借法案內、使中國因美國之奧援、成爲更强而統一之國家、</p>
<p>運輸專家多人來華</p>
<p>大陸報昨就美國運輸專家來華事著評稱、美國運輸專家阿恩期丁·希爾曼與達維斯三氏、刻在重慶、會同滇緬公路委員會·對公路與運輸狀况、作匝月之詳盡考察、華盛頓且傳佳音、謂彼等返美後、美國將派運輸專家三十人來華、改善公路之現行系統、俾能暢運美國依據租借法而運華之巨額接濟品、</p>
<p>新式飛機運抵中國</p>
<p>紐約時報駐渝訪電且傳達維斯之言稱、中中國已向美採購兩噸半重之卡車千輛、同時、蔣委員長新顧問拉鐵摩、日前途出馬尼刺時、謂「中國確在美國租借程序之內、」美國新飛機·美籍駕駛員與高射砲旣已抵中國西部、乃有種種理由可信美國之接濟、必能運抵目的地、」</p>
<p>日認大局益趨嚴重</p>
<p>美國人士現談及援華事、公開無忌、巳足警吿日本不久將有何種發展、恫嚇手段固不足阻滯美國對重慶中國國民政府之援助、而日本領袖以國際大局益趨嚴重、警告其國民、可見其終究明瞭已導人民入窘境矣、同時、東京之宣傳機關報力圖激起民衆反對法屬越南之情緒、俾能分散民衆對中國戰局僵持之注意、並以此爲加緊限制對華作戰之藉口、</p>
<p>戰時運輸極關重要</p>
<p>已抵中國之美運輸專家、當然僅係行將追踵來華的其他專家與技師之先遣隊而已、運輸一項、於戰時極稱重要、在此方面、予以襄助、可糾正中國作戰弱點之一、美國將供給中國之接濟與軍火、旣有增無已、又有運輸此等接濟品所必要之工具、則蔣委員長領導下之中國軍隊、大可賴以早日戰勝、當然世人皆盼中國應盡可能範圍、竭力擊退侵略者、而中國接獲美國所允諾之接濟品與戰具、固確能早日逐出侵略者也、</p>
<p>自由曙光終於實現</p>
<p>中國運輸系統將獲美國這協助、增進效能、以作日後大舉之初步準備、此誠可喜消息、茲後必能發揮威力、可以預斷、中國現可堅抱信心、展望前途、深知其黑暗時期、業已過去、自由曙光、終已現於地平綫上、蓋中國賴自力更生、復仗英美蘇盟國之襄助、勝利已在望矣、願與運輸專家共勉之、</p>

<p>煤球塊屑均已回跌</p>
<p>煤市塲因現貨突增、又格、連續下跌、一二三號海峯煤塊、每噸均跌至四百四十元以內、赫凌屑每噸回跌至二百元左右、因煤屑價格下跌、煤球成本亦大爲减輕、最近每日由一千餘噸之銷數、减至七百餘噸、昨日各大煤球廠咸將煤球廠盤减低至二百九十六元惟各門售煤球之價格、則頗不一致、每擔售價自十五元至十六元不等、殊屬非是、</p>

<p>言語隔閡致生事端</p>
<p>該發言人又述肇事經過稱、日海軍所雇卡車夫某將調他處、乃偕同伴五人在法租界德明飯館附近某酒　暢飲、至午前三時一刻返家、途遇越捕一名、諒因言語隔閡、致起紛爭、僅一二分鐘、日人即登海軍卡車擬馳去、越捕嗚警笛召到數捕、開槍射擊、致卡車夫胸腹與左臂均中彈、胃部且受融刀傷、雖經飛送醫院、即晨六時十分不治身亡、另一日人亦被碎玻璃割傷、餘四日人未受創、法公董局否認負開槍之責、後始承認卡車夫因中彈及刀傷喪生、日人均未持械，法方所稱越捕兩名受彈傷、必係被他捕放出之槍彈擊傷、肇事後、五日人被法當局拘往盤詰、當日午後十時五十分釋出、此事雖未解決、然日方未對法租界施封鎖、</p>

<h3>天才的照片</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>母親的肚子是照像機，嬰孩是底片，遺傳的才能是底片上的影像，環境與敎育是顯像液。</p>
<p>就這樣，每僩嬰孩在出世的時候，是一張已經拍過照的底片了。這些底片中所賦有的才能與天分，是需要良好的顯像液去加以沖洗，才能使底片上的良辰美景全部呈現出來的。</p>
<p>泥水匠的兒子，未始就沒有科學的天才，然而爲了環境與經濟的限制，也許祇好一生一世與磚石灰泥爲伍。並不是說泥水匠不値得一做，而是說假如有優良的科學天才的話，任令他受了環境的限制去做泥水匠，對於世界是一種重大的損失；等於把一位名家所攝的底片，在沒有經過顯像液的冲洗以前，就把它丟了，這是一件多麼可惜的事。然而我們這貧富不均的社會，却正在這樣做！</p>
<p>這個太大的缺憾，一時是無法完全加以彌補的，然而社會人士的努力總算還不是一件完全落空的事。由報讀者助學金的創設，就是希望能够彌補這缺憾的一部份。藉着各位讀者的捐助，我們希望能替社會洗出幾張優美的底片來。</p>
<p>每個有爲的淸寒子弟都是値得一試的底片，諸各位讀者供給顯像液！</p>
<h3>螢虫與蒼蠅</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>某個晚上，在碧綠色的樹叢裏，一只遲歸的蒼蠅同一只早出的螢虫遇見了；天眞熱，牠們可以在這裏乘歇凉，相對無言太難堪，所以大家來交談了。</p>
<p>「這位就是蠅兄嗎？」螢虫開口說。</p>
<p>「正是，敢問老兄是那位？」蒼蠅睜着全體複眼問。螢虫不答，抖一抖尾巴，發出一圈翡翠色的光，好像說：「虫類中那一個身上有光的？」蒼蠅雖然見識有限，也知道對方叫什麽，就接着說：「喔，原來是螢兄，眞是久仰久仰！我們的名字讀音相近，幾百年前概是一家吧？」蒼蠅最健談了，但末一句話的用意，在那裏呢？</p>
<p>「雖然讀音相近」，螢虫嚴肅地說：「我同你並沒有關係；就拿淸潔問題來說，你我之間的距離多遠！」</p>
<p>「這倒無所謂，習慣成自然，我不覺骯髒之爲懾髒。—呃，螢兄，今天天氣……」蒼蠅顯然要把話題念開，但螢虫要把它拉回，就說：</p>
<p>「習慣固成自然，不過同骯髒接近究竟是個壞習慣；你看，你脚上都是垃圾屑，嘴上沾滿油腥，翅上發出臭氣，還像什麼？」</p>
<p>「這是生活問題」蒼蠅不服氣地說，「生　第一，淸潔或骯髒有什麼要緊？老實說，你那樣面黃肌瘦，都是求淸潔求出來的。你看我油頭肥耳，大腹便便，多光榮呀！而考其原因，都由於不嫌骯髒」。蒼蠅大步走了起來，樣子十分自得。</p>
<p>「同骯髒沆瀣一起的都是敗類！」螢虫大聲說。</p>
<p>蒼蠅回過頭來說：「什麼？我是敗類？你是什麽？」</p>
<p>「我是光明的創造者；我的責任是同黑暗搏鬥。星是天上的明燈，我是地上的明燈」。</p>
<p>「喔哈哈」！蒼蠅笑了說，「多麽空洞的說法！世界上骯髒與黑暗得勢，跟潮流走，才是英傑。」</p>
<p>「哼！原來是一副奴才的嘴臉！」</p>
<p>「老兄不該出口傷人，老兄的意思是——」</p>
<p>「我叫你走」！螢虫憤憤地說。蒼蠅一看不對勁，就一挺膨脹的肚子飛了，一邊嗡嗡地響着，想是飛到那邊有堆狗糞的地方去了。</p>
<p>螢虫又發光，黑暗給它震碎了。</p>
<h3>跟</h3>
<p>— 陳琪作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦庚馬</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>現在秋海棠的生命終算是沒有危險了。</p>
<p>「唉！我這一塲病眞把你害苦了！」每當他女兒把煮好的稀粥，或含有補性的湯藥，捧給他喝的時候，他總是連連的嘆息着。「學堂裏的功課躭擱了不算，連你的兩條手臂，也瘦得像烏腿一樣了！唉！眞想不到我會生起瘟病來！」</p>
<p>「人怎麼能永遠不生病呢？」梅寳總是堆着笑，竭力安慰他。「念書的事沒有什麼關係的，至多遲一年畢業，也小是什麼見不得人的事。爸爸，你好好地餐息吧！我只希望你能够早一天起床好一天。」</p>
<p>「我也是這麽想啊！無奈這一身要命的骨頭，眞像在錯缽裏浸了半個月一樣，再也硬不起來了。」秋海棠用手搥着床沿，自怨自艾地說。</p>
<p>因此，他的熱度雖已退盡了，但梅實每天煮藥的工作，却還不能就停止，大夫說至少還得喝一二十劑咧！</p>
<p>在秋海棠患病的時期裏，梅寳却多交了一個朋友，那是對門開雜貨鋪的孟掌櫃的兒媳。實際上，她們是早就認識了，不過以前見了面，祇是點點頭笑笑就算了，還不够稱得上是朋友。直到秋海棠病，梅寳天天上他們舖子裏去買東西，或是托帶什麼藥品，孟家的小內掌櫃才和她談起來了；這女人的年紀大概至少要比梅寳大七八歲，可是做人非常熱心，你不去找她，她往往肯自己會走來給你幫忙。在秋海棠的病勢最厲害的幾天裏，梅寳和小狗子兩個，倒的確承她給了不少幫助，因此梅寳跟她兩人的友誼，便在很自然的狀態下，變得怪親密了。</p>
<p>「妹妹，你爸爸今兒怎麼樣了？嚮午吃了些什麼東西？孟掌櫃的兒媳，輕手輕脚地走進廚房來，把一條手搭在梅寳的肩上問。（一六〇）</p>

<h3>護眼罩</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>外國人士對於健美之注意，殊非光浴，簡而易行，唯在國內則仍不多覯。美國之日光浴者，爲保護眼睛，使不受炎陽光綫之刺激及損害起見，近發明鋁製之眼罩一種，輕巧便利，置諸眼上，眼睛仍可開閉自如。外部塗以鋁漆一層，能反射日光，使眼罩熱度不致過高。眼罩之間，有金屬綫連繫之，如眼鏡然。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>剖屍</h3>
<p>— 盧景蔚</p>
<p>醫科學生挨過了第一學期的骨骼課程，第二年起，便要終日躱在解剖間裏　死人，這事是大家公認爲够刺激的，見了死人不但不怕，並且還當作寳貝。</p>
<p>解剖間不大，只有兩個大地坑，裏面專門藏死人，全用藥水浸好，這種藥水味給聞不慣的朋友嗅到了，準會眼淚鼻涕一齊流出來。</p>
<p>屍體有男有女，有老有小，花花式式，要整個有，半個也有，甚至於一隻手一隻脚，只要人身上東西，不腐不爛，除掉藥水味道，一點也不知道是死人。</p>
<p>假使給你一隻腰子，不說出是人腰，你準會拿去加些蝦仁炒來吃，你看見一隻腦子，又大又重，放在藥水內堅固之後，要兩隻手才捧得動，不要以爲是牛腦，其實大家都是一樣的。</p>
<p>胖人，大家都說是肥肉太多了。錯了，完全錯了，全是瘦的，簡直比牛肉還精，一個新鮮死人的肉比頭等牛肉還要精彩。</p>
<p>「矮子肚裏疙瘩多」，這句話靠不住，肚腸剪開後，蛔蟲倒常發現。</p>
<p>人肺最不衛生，顏色灰黑，活像在陰溝裏掏出來，這是因爲吸進煤灰的關係。猪的鼻子雖然成犬在泥沼內鑽東鑽西，但是猪肺却很淸潔，顏色鮮紅，白胖柔嫩。</p>
<p>什麼地方壞了的，全要找出來；怎樣死了的要查個明白。聽聽外科醫生開刀本領大，要不是在解剖學上下過功夫，手術決不會好。就是內科醫生在活人胸脯上拿着聽筒聽，指頭打便可知肺的健全與否，也先得研究死人。肺爛後聲音是兩樣的，把死人切開來看過就明白。傷寒症是腸上有了潰瘍，腸子切開後就可看見，決不是胡說曰道。肉眼看不見的。可以做顯微鏡片子在鏡下窺視，便瞭如指掌了。</p>
<h3>嚴厲製裁受賄</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>據央國行賄偵查聯合會在一九四〇年度的會務報吿中宜稱：該年度內破獲受賄的案件，共計四十三起。</p>
<p>其中有一起乃是與建造防空壕有關係的。受賄的一個民事檢察官與一個視察員都被判了一年零三個月的徒刑；還有幾個共犯則各被判九月至一年不等。之外，還有一椿，有某主席者納賄五鎊給一個巡捕，叫巡捕控一個誤踏進他房子里來的少年盜竊，結果也都判了罪。</p>
<p>這一種偵查行賄的機關，我以爲，是應該由我們大家起來熱烈地予以贊助，予以合作的。尤其在戰爭的時候，往往因爲一個人的受賄，而使許多的平民受到了損害；無論在道德上，或者在職務上說來，這都是應該予以最嚴厲的制裁的！</p>

<p>蓓蓓姍弟Baby　Sandy的出身是一個收塲主人的女兒，每天在牛奶的氣氛中過活，現在已由三歲進入四歲了。她在好萊塢將奠定了童星的寳座，前途正未可限量。她第一次在平考斯具主演的一部歌唱片中演出，但時間雖祇隔短短兩年，現在她在銀幕上面，我們看去，比兩年之前不同了，已長大了好多，十足的一個小姑娘典型了。</p>
<p>憶兩年之前，環球拍攝一部歌唱片，由歌唱明星平考斯貝主演，徵求一個童星，結果蓓蓓姍弟是入選了。那時我們在銀幕上看去，她是男是女，還不能淸楚的看出。但現在，她一雙碧藍的眸子，一頭金黃色的捲髮，已十足的顯示出她是個女小孩了。</p>
<p>姍弟的父親魯易亨威爾是洛衫磯的一個牧塲主人，當初姍弟的母親，在報紙上讀到影片公司微求一個嬰孩的廣吿，就暗示她的丈夫，姍弟拍有幾張照片，不妨寄去應微。這張照片都在牧塲上拍的，以乳牛和牛乳爲背景。</p>
<p>却爾斯潑利文是環球的音樂導演，就把姍弟的照片交給攝影師大衛勃脫萊，因爲大衛是負責選擇這孩角的人，結果是被選入了。現在她有三十磅體重，三呎六吋長度。她在玩具中，最歡喜洋囡囡，另外有一個橡皮球。一輛馬車，也視爲愛物。她最要好的伴侶是鄰家的一個男孩，叫鮑勃，他有玩具貨車和玩具汽車，他們兩人時常把所有的玩具搬在一起玩。</p>
<p>姍弟會熟讀影片中的對白，她最會說的兩句話，便是「啊！是的。」和「讓我們那樣做，好嗎？」她祇拍過三部影片，便是Saudy　is　a　Lady和「娘要嫁人」Sand　Gets　Her　Man而另一部就是平考斯貝主演的歌唱片。</p>
<p>正和很多其他的大明星一樣，在拍戲時，如果有她的戲，看見五光十色的佈景，會目眩起來。然而她不像大人，一切都很天眞和率直。「我呢，我站在那裏？」拍戲時她常常這樣問，無疑在今後的幾年中，她在好萊塢將奪得秀蘭鄧波兒的地位。是一顆不可輕視的童星呢！</p>

<h3>（十五）詹姆斯，史都華（James　Stewart）</h3>
<p>— 小郞</p>
<p>他以演「舊寵新歡」一片獲得今年的演技最佳金像獎。但是根據一般的論調，他的「民主萬歲」似乎比較的來得高明些。他所主演的角色總是有些忸怩之態，和他木人的性格相近。他生於一九〇八年五月二十日，當他從學校裏畢業出來，赴紐約找尋職業，但是沒有成功。他和同學亨利方達在百老匯的時候，實在是他倆一生最難堪而潦倒的遭遇了，直到一九三三年才漸漸地交了運氣，現在居然也列四大明星之流了。他和奧麗薇哈佛蘭相愛，看來很有結婚的可能。</p>
<h3>重看「狂歡之夜」</h3>
<p>— 斯人</p>
<p>留下可愛的舊跡</p>
<p>發行人卞毓英等發起的國產巨片複映，第一砲一狂歡之夜」，巳於前晚起在滬光開映了；八時二十分就吿上下客滿，戲院當局認爲是奇蹟，據說新片子也沒有這種鋒頭。筆者也於是晚蒞塲重觀，我　得比看一部新的片子更興奮，更喜悅。記得朋友們爲亡友沈西苓舉行追悼會的席上，陳列着許多西苓的遺作—如「十字街頭」「船家女」諸片的照片，費穆導演看了那些照片說：「平常我們看影片的照片，不能隔上三年五載，一過了時，就會看不順眼，而西苓的遺作，到如今看來還是値得重看的！」我看「狂歡之夜」，也有這種心情，覺得史東山的導演手法，不僅沒有落伍」，反而不是今日的大部分新片中所能看得到的。而金山胡萍顧而已王爲一諸人的洗練動人，努力不懈，撫今追昔，叫人有「一代不如一代」之感。特別看到周璇的書面，是那末天眞，那末嬌憨，眞是她的黃金時代，如今周璇郤又是一副面目了。電影片爲人們留下可愛的舊跡，又何嘗不是殘忍的烙印呢。</p>
<p>不是說如今沒有「狂歡之夜」一類的作品，不過太少，太少了。</p>

<p>第十二章　盡是寗武可奈何</p>
<p>許靖說了。太息不已，柳隱英也深愧自己來遲了，不能極早效力，這是一個大大的觖憾。便嘆道：這些話不必說了。小弟也有抱恨之處。我們且歇息一夜，明日一早跑到寗武去窺探虛實，隨機應變，再作道理。小弟好歹要和流寇　戰一下呢。」許靖心裏雖然發急，一時也無主意，只好聽從柳隱英的說話，口裏頻頻嘆氣，依然睡了下去。柳隱英却又去吩咐老和尙端了一塊木板來，將椅子擱着，算做臨時床舖，脫衣而睡。心裏有了心事，當然睡不成眠，聽聽許靖在那　坑上輾轉反側，唉聲嘆氣，料是爲了寗武關，故而不寐。到下半夜時，窗上紅色淡了不少，大約大火已熄。轉瞬東方已白。柳隱英首先一骨碌爬起身來，見許靖張大着一雙眼睛，正在竊窺自己。他一邊穿衣，一邊向許靖格勒一笑道：「靖哥沒有睡熟嗎？爲什麼目灼灼儘視小弟呢？」許靖也就起坐，說道：「寗武關發生大火，多半業已失去，我那裏再能酣睡？我瞧賢弟也沒有入夢呢。」柳隱英點點頭，又問道：「臂上的傷處覺得怎麼樣？」許靖答道：「幸而沒有傷及筋骨，祇覺隱隱有些疼痛，尙不能活動使用。但也顧不得了，我與你快快跑向寗武關去吧。」柳隱英說聲是，二人都披衣起身。柳隱英出去向老和尙取了二盆冷水來。二人將就盥洗，各自把髮理好，將巾戴上。老和尙却捧上一大甌熱騰騰的粥來。二人聞得粥香，雖沒有什麼采，祇一盆鹽蘿蔔乾。爲果腹計，二人都吃了三碗，把一大甌粥吃個精光。柳隱英遂喚老和尙過來，又取出三四兩碎銀給了他。且說道：「昨日打擾，我們不勝感謝，現在吿辭了。」老和尙稽首致謝，說願二位「前程萬里。」（一一七）</p>

<h3>Even if the United States Takes on Mediation, China Will Not Sign a Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War Has Become Part of a World War</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's Speech to American Journalists</p>
<p>Chongqing - Newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, today denied to the Associated Press that Germany had attempted to resolve the Sino-Japanese War before recognizing the Nanjing regime. Foreign Minister Guo stated that China would never sign any peace treaty, even if the United States took on mediation. At the same time, Guo warned that the United States' failure to stop supplying oil to Japan had the implication of an appeasement policy, which would eventually lead to self-inflicted harm. When asked about rumors that the German diplomatic community had attempted to mediate the Sino-Japanese War before severing relations with China, Guo replied that he had not heard of any such plan or proposal. Guo stated, "Regarding peace with Japan, you must know that even if the United States were to negotiate a peace treaty, we would not be able to sign it." Guo explained that even the United States could not provide sufficient guarantees for such a peace at this time. Guo also said, "As I have said before, my belief, which is also the view of our government, is that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War must now become part of the resolution of the World War. Everyone should now understand that the war in Europe and the war in Asia have merged into one. After the experience since 1931, it would be foolish for China to sign any treaty with Japan that is not part of a global settlement." Regarding the United States supplying oil to Japan, Guo said that he expected that it would not continue for long, and that this policy had the implication of appeasement, and the appeasement policy often led to self-inflicted harm. Guo also denied the rumors spread by the Japanese side in Thailand that the Chinese Blue Shirts Society was plotting to assassinate the pro-Japanese Thai Prime Minister in Thailand. He said, "This news is completely unfounded. This kind of rumor is intended to agitate the public, which any observer can see through. The Thai issue is shrouded in obscurity. We are very sympathetic to the current situation in Thailand and want to help them without hindering them." Guo stated that China has experienced the problems and difficulties that Thailand is currently facing. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Sir Wigginton Praises China's Spirit of Perseverance</h3>
<p>People Everywhere Unanimously Support the Central Government</p>
<p>And Hold the Belief that Final Victory Will Be Achieved</p>
<p>Chongqing - Australian explorer Sir Wigginton, in a broadcast here yesterday, briefly stated that he traveled around the Pacific, and had been to Manchuria, Peiping, and major cities in eastern and southern China. He repeatedly heard expressions of trust from the Chinese, not only from officials but also from people on the streets, believing that all parts of China could be unified under the great principles of democracy expounded by President Sun and implemented by Chairman Chiang. He personally witnessed in China an indomitable spirit, the extent of which could not be imagined by those who had not seen it themselves. Although Northeast and Southern China are temporarily occupied, they still hold a noble spirit of endurance, and a belief in future independence, ultimate freedom, and personal and local security. The general population believes that under the guidance of Chairman Chiang, this goal can be achieved. When he traveled to Changchun, someone told him that although the production of Manchuria had received assistance from Japan in terms of finance, etc., and the convenience of transportation provided by the South Manchurian Railway, it had ultimately not made more progress than it had fifteen years ago. Today's production is not as good as it could be, and the people are unwilling to devote themselves to production. Even though propaganda is being actively promoted, the determination of the people to break away from the Chinese central government is deeply rooted and has never been relaxed. An official in Xiamen told him that although the area was occupied, all enlightened Chinese deeply knew that the greatest hope for freedom and independence lay in the development and success of the policies advocated by Chairman Chiang. This belief in certain victory exists in Chongqing. Although the city of Chongqing has been bombed, it has had no effect. The public sentiment is astonishingly impassioned and vigorous. Everywhere one sees human perseverance, individual stubbornness, and the efficiency of the government. The model shown by Chongqing can be promoted in the world to strengthen the efficiency of resistance when resisting aggressor nations. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Welcome Rain in Luoyang</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Kerr Delivers Speech on Democracy in Chongqing</h3>
<p>It is Said that China is a Democratic Country and is Fighting for Democratic Countries Worldwide</p>
<p>Chongqing - British Ambassador Kerr delivered a speech on the spirit of democracy to 400 members of the Chinese intellectual class in Chongqing today, lasting for half an hour. After the British Ambassador's speech, Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, denounced the Japanese claim that China is not a democratic country. Ambassador Kerr stated that China is a democratic country and is fighting for democratic countries worldwide, and pointed out that China is rapidly advancing towards complete democracy. Ambassador Kerr said, "You have already joined the ranks of democratic countries in the world and are working together with all democratic countries in the world to ensure that democracy can exist and not disappear from the face of the earth. You are doing this not because you believe you can win, but because you and all the democratic countries in the world share the idea of maintaining democracy. I think your view is completely correct. You have recognized that the current war is being fought for democracy, and all famous countries in the world recognize that this is true and acknowledge that you and they are fighting for the same goal. The founders of modern China have set a direction for you, wanting you to gradually move towards the success of democracy, just as we have in our country. From the perspective of a foreign observer like myself, you seem to have taken the first step, and the National Political Council is proof of this. The great nature of this organization makes a deep impression on any observer. Once the current war is over and the spirit of China can be free, your progress towards democracy will be even faster." Ambassador Kerr then reviewed the historical background of the democratic system and discussed Nazism in detail. He said, "Nazism is a new dark age in which human thought must be restricted and the human spirit cannot be expressed. But the modern democratic system is neither outdated nor exhausted, and is currently advancing in its youth, is very far-reaching, and will continue to advance."</p>

<h3>China Four Years After the War of Resistance Will Become a Great Power</h3>
<p>That Cannot Be Conquered by Other Countries</p>
<p>Lattimore's Remarks Upon Arrival in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Chiang Kai-shek's advisor, Lattimore, flew here from the United States this afternoon. According to his remarks to reporters, after four years of China's War of Resistance, it has not only maintained its independence but has also become a major power in the international community. Although he has never met Chiang Kai-shek, he has long admired the greatness of the Chairman's character and achievements. It is a great honor in his life to be able to work under the leadership of the Chairman. The New Order in the Far East is a constructive matter, but the one who will establish this order is not Japan, but China. Regarding American aid to China, it is only the beginning and will not be interrupted thereafter. There are two main points of view in American public opinion regarding the world situation, namely, that Britain in the West cannot be conquered by other countries, and Britain will never surrender, and that China in the East cannot be conquered by other countries and will not surrender. Lattimore is 41 years old this year and plans to stay in Hong Kong for three days before going to Chongqing to begin his work. According to Lattimore, his term is only six months this time, and whether he will continue to serve after the term expires has not yet been discussed. When asked if he plans to inspect various parts of the country, he replied that everything depends on the Chairman's orders. Lattimore speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese, can also speak Mongolian, and is familiar with the Shanxi dialect. He originally decided to come to China when the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937. He was in Peiping at that time. (Dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Chiang Kai-shek's American political advisor, Lattimore, arrived here by plane from the United States yesterday afternoon. Those who welcomed him included Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Dong Xian Guang, Minister Kong's representative, Zhong, and the American Consul, etc. Lattimore later told reporters that there is a kind of order in East Asia, that is, the constructive order that China is creating today. When asked about aid to China, he replied that this aid will definitely increase and not decrease. Lattimore declined to comment on Japan's next step, whether it will be south or north, but said that the rumors circulating in Manila say that Japan will go south, and others say that Japan will go north, each holding their own opinion. Japan today has become a nation of rumors, which is truly a bad reflection of Japan. After four years of the War of Resistance, China has become the guiding nation of Asia, which is incomparable to the past, and in fact has become a great world power. Lattimore also said that he came to China as a private citizen of the United States to serve Chiang Kai-shek, and plans to stay in China for six months. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Xu Mo Internally Appointed as China's Envoy to Australia, Australian Government Has Agreed</h3>
<p>Eggleston Internally Appointed as Australia's Envoy to China</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to diplomatic sources, Xu Mo, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been internally appointed as the first Chinese envoy to Australia and the Australian government has been consulted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a reply telegram from the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 15th, expressing its agreement with the candidate for the first Chinese envoy. Xu's appointment will be announced within days. As for the first Australian envoy to China, Eggleston, has been internally appointed, and the Chinese government has agreed. After Eggleston's new appointment is announced, he is expected to depart for China at the beginning of next month. The vacancy of Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be filled by Chuan Bingchang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Chuan has already arrived at the Ministry to take up his duties, and his formal appointment will be announced within days. (Dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Sydney - It was officially announced here yesterday that the current Chinese Foreign Minister Xu Mo will be the first Chinese envoy to Australia. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Chinese sources in London believe that Xu Mo's appointment as envoy to Australia is a sign of China's special emphasis on Australia. Xu has served in the diplomatic community for many years and is one of the most capable diplomatic talents. Xu has the rank of ambassador, and now taking on the position of envoy to Australia shows that China is sending a first-class figure to Australia. This move is the same as the U.S. government's transfer of Ambassador to China Johnson to the position of envoy to Austria. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Question of the Far Eastern Anti-Aggression Front</h3>
<p>In the twenty-odd days since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, several new situations have arisen on the European continent and on both sides of the Atlantic, causing a change in the world's perception; only in one corner of the Far East, which was originally expected to undergo changes, has a considerable degree of tranquility been maintained. This tranquility, of course, anyone can see is built on an extremely unstable balance, where the intertwining and collision of several factors have forced those accustomed to taking advantage of the chaos to act cautiously, quietly awaiting the shift in the situation; at the same time, it goes without saying that any change in any one of these factors will affect the overall situation, turning tranquility into turmoil.</p>
<p>This situation is naturally most conducive to the breeding of appeasement policies, and thus, the various fears about the Far Eastern appeasement policy that have recently arisen, even if not entirely based on factual grounds, should not be overly criticized in the sense of preventing problems before they arise. However, it is extremely obvious that the Far Eastern situation today is not something that appeasement policies can effectively address. After repeated bitter lessons, even the most incompetent politicians no longer dare to entrust the future security to the expectation of appeasement policies; at most, they will only use appeasement tactics to temporarily deal with the situation while awaiting the completion of preparations when their strength is insufficient or when it is difficult to attend to everything. Recently, while fierce battles are raging on the western border of the Soviet Union, it has suddenly announced the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk as dangerous areas; the United States, while the extension of the conscription bill is being debated in Congress, has also requested a huge sum of more than 70 million US dollars from Congress to be used for the construction of naval bases in the Pacific. From these events one can discern a glimpse of the preparations being made by both sides for future events in the Far East. The United States' efforts to strengthen its defenses in the Pacific have been a consistent policy for several years, and the phrase "the important front line of the United States is still in the Pacific" in this proposal is precisely aimed at those prejudices that regard aid to Britain as being more urgent than everything else. As for the Soviet Union's designation of dangerous maritime zones in the Far East, it is naturally a measure that a nation at war should take, but the so-called protection of navigation to Vladivostok in fact requires all routes from there to the Pacific to pass through Japanese territorial waters; regardless of whether German submarines have appeared in the Pacific so far, even if they were to truly endanger the route to Vladivostok, it would not be possible to do so without using Japanese seaports as bases, which is impossible given the provisions of Article 2 of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, while the Japanese side still declares its obligation to abide by the treaty. The Soviet Union did not seek to ensure the safety of Vladivostok's sea passage from the Soviet-Japanese treaty, but rather resorted to armed measures such as laying mines. If it is said that this is only to prevent German submarine activity, it is clearly like shooting at a target that does not exist. The recent special promotion of this incident by the Japanese side, what its intentions and reactions are, will not be discussed for now. On the Soviet side, even if it cannot be immediately concluded that the Soviet authorities lack trust in the effectiveness of the treaty, it should at least have the same intention as the fact that some of its large armies remain stationed in the East.</p>
<p>Currently in Europe, Britain and the Soviet Union have joined forces in the form of an alliance, realizing the ideal demand of the world for several years, while in the Far East, this method may not be fully applicable at present; because the Far Eastern war and the European war only converge in the sense of anti-aggression, and otherwise each has its own special goals and targets. Before there is further development in the situation, this point cannot be summarily dismissed. This kind of peculiar existence is naturally the source of the recently rumored appeasement policy in the Far East, but it can never become a strong reason, because these two groups of wars each have their common ground in anti-aggression. Any relaxation or concession to any aggressor is a loss to the entire anti-aggression war. Therefore, every country engaged in tangible and intangible wars for anti-aggression must cooperate closely with each other based on its own position. But in the Far East today, there is only individual cooperation among the anti-aggression countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and there is a lack of coordinated action as a whole. The strengths of the various countries naturally vary, but everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. It may be insufficient to cope alone, but jointly planning to deal with the situation will surely be able to quell the chaos. Instead of relying on unreliable treaties and incomplete defenses, which may lead to delaying opportunities, it is better to cooperate with each other to take effective measures. China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the Far East certainly cannot be compared with the allied operations of Britain and the Soviet Union, but the degree of their mutual cooperation should not be too far from that of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Europe.</p>
<p>The so-called wait-and-see policy is by no means static, and its other side is to speed up the completion of necessary preparations to await a favorable opportunity. The recent situation in the Far East is on the path to clarification, and there is no reason for pessimism, but in terms of preventing future disasters from happening, there are still some areas that have not been reached. In this regard, China will be able to have the most satisfactory performance in the near future, while other related powers should give further serious consideration.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Issues Statement Insisting on Amending Enlistment Act</h3>
<p>Restrictions on Selective Service Quotas Should Also Be Lifted</p>
<p>Otherwise, There Is a Possibility of Causing a "Tragedy"</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Associated Press) - President Roosevelt, when discussing the amendment of the Enlistment Act at a press conference yesterday, said that if the bill is not amended, the U.S. Army (which the President believes is the smallest in the world) is in danger of rapid corruption, because two-thirds of its personnel will return to their farms and will have to be supplemented by new troops.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the U.S. Selective Service Act originally had a clause stating that the service period of conscripts could be extended due to the Congress declaring a state of national emergency or amending this law. Soldiers serving one year are bound by this provision, so Congress extending the service period of conscripts and national defense soldiers is not a breach of faith. He believes that the army should not collapse, which is the simple question that should be decided at present, and this decision now rests with Congress.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall, when presenting his views to the Senate Military Committee on July 9 in support of legislation extending the service period of national defense soldiers, etc., by one year, said that he should have sent specially trained troops to Iceland to replace the Marines, but this could not be achieved because of the one-year service period stipulation. If the one-year limit is not lifted, most of the trained troops currently in the United States will disappear into nothingness. He had no intention of a plan for an expeditionary force, but the declaration of a national emergency by President Roosevelt cannot be ignored. He personally believes that for the public interest, Congress should declare the existence of a national emergency.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Associated Press) - U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall declared to the Senate Military Committee that if the service period of enlisted personnel and the National Guard could not be extended beyond the original one-year period, there was a possibility of it becoming a "national tragedy." It is said that General Marshall's remarks were made at the executive meeting of the committee. He also said, "In view of the international situation and the rapidly increasing threat to our country, I believe that if we were to actually disband and demobilize two-thirds of our trained soldiers and three-quarters of our trained officers at this time based on purely theoretical grounds, it is extremely likely to cause a tragic outcome for the entire nation." He pointed out that the Enlistment Act could make soldiers available in times of national emergency. He said, "According to the Army Department's opinion, a state of emergency now exists." He also said that current laws do not allow the dispatch of troops to assist in the occupation of Iceland, and in view of the fact that the term of service of the reserves will soon expire, it is necessary to request the consent of these soldiers to extend their service. He also said, "As a result of this announcement, more than one expeditionary warship may be sunk." Yesterday, General Marshall also asked Congress to grant broader powers to dismiss unsuitable officers at its discretion.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Patterson wrote to Speaker of the House Rayburn yesterday, formally stating that President Roosevelt approved of extending the term of service for the National Guard, conscripts, and reserves beyond the originally stipulated one year. The President also wanted to lift the limit of 900,000 conscripts. Patterson also stated that Germany has won every battle from Austria to Russia, the reason for which is that the countries involved have not made adequate preparations for defending against aggression. Germany attacks in every battle with a large army with a very large number of people. We cannot try our national security with unprepared troops. Looking at the events of the past few months, to demobilize the army today is simply inviting disaster.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (International News Service) - The House Appropriations Committee revealed yesterday that the pending $4,770,000,000 Army appropriations bill could supply a fully equipped army of three million, which is twice the current strength. Senior Army officials said that this money would be used to purchase various equipment, small arms, clothing, personal items, machine guns, etc., and pointed out that they knew that so many troops were not needed at present, but this preparation would have a psychological impact on the enemy. One year later, the strength of the U.S. Army could compete with the major armies of Europe.</p>
<h3>Two Bays in the Philippines Declared Naval Zones</h3>
<p>Laying Mines Prohibits Passage</p>
<p>Manila, 16th (Reuters) - Naval authorities announced today that Manila and Subic Bays, due to the laying of mines, will become dangerous areas starting on the evening of July 17. The entrance to Subic Bay has been declared a naval defense zone, prohibiting passage. The entrance to Manila Bay may only be passable during the day.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Associated Press) - Military experts say that the Navy Department's emphasis on the defense of the Philippines is very important for U.S.-Philippine relations and the U.S. military position in the Far East. The President's request to allocate funds to build an air base worth $5,570,000 in Cavite has not been met with much opposition, but there are some hints of opposition from isolationists on this issue.</p>
<p>U.S. Fleet Gathers in the Pacific</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Reuters)</p>
<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun published an article today saying that the Japanese Navy is closely watching the movements of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The Japanese Navy cannot ignore the U.S. distribution of ships to the Pacific and the establishment of bases in the Aleutian Islands and Hawaii, intending to encircle the islands in the South Pacific under Japanese mandate. The United States has kept its main naval force in the Pacific, only transferring patrol ships to the Atlantic, and according to recent statements by its Secretary of the Navy, Knox, the United States believes that there is a "hypothetical enemy" in the Pacific. The main force of the U.S. fleet gathered in the Pacific includes 12 battleships, 11 heavy cruisers, 14 light cruisers, 3 aircraft carriers, 92 destroyers, and 31 submarines, with 8 battleships, 20 light and heavy cruisers, 2 aircraft carriers, 60 destroyers, and 10 submarines stationed in the waters off Hawaii, and the rest patrolling the Panama Canal and the west coast of the United States. Since 1939, the United States has used Hawaii as its forward naval base and concentrated the main force of its fleet there, ostensibly to engage in exercises, but now it is prepared to fight at any time.</p>
<h3>U.S. Develops Ten Onshore Military Stations</h3>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt approved a case last night to use about $31 million for the Navy to develop ten onshore military stations.</p>
<h3>Both the Far East and Europe Have Peace Soundings</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Secretary Tells Reporters That the U.S. Government Has Not Received Proposals</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Associated Press) - President Roosevelt mentioned yesterday at a reception for reporters the news about peace talks in the Far East and Europe. The President said that many people of status had received peace soundings from both the Far East and Europe, but these soundings were not made by authoritative figures. These people of status believed that peace, if it could be achieved, would be most welcome, so they immediately rushed to Washington to inform the White House. It is believed here that the President's comparison of the peace talks in Europe and Asia is very important. Japan is currently planning a new territorial war, and at the same time, it is rumored that the State Department is thinking of appeasing Japan, so the President's mention of peace matters in Asia is most timely. Washington, 16th (Reuters) - President Secretary O'Leary, when receiving reporters yesterday, spoke about the remarks made by New York Mayor LaGuardia on Sunday, saying that the U.S. government has not officially received Hitler's peace proposal. Under Secretary of State Welles agreed with LaGuardia on promoting a peace treaty in the United States. Although he had occasionally heard of a peace proposal, it was not a formal proposal received by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt, when receiving reporters yesterday, asked about the rumors that German Deputy Führer Hess flew to England with a peace treaty containing conditions such as Britain maintaining its navy and all parts of the empire. The President replied that he believed that even Churchill did not know about this proposal.</p>

<h3>Konoe Convenes Emergency Meeting, Cabinet Resigns En Masse Unexpectedly</h3>
<p>Konoe Temporarily Retains Post by Imperial Order; Matsuoka Submits Resignation Early, Not Participating in Meeting</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th – Although the Konoe Cabinet resigned en masse today, the Emperor has ordered Konoe to remain in office pending further instructions. Konoe immediately convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 11:00 PM today, informing his colleagues of the Emperor's order for him to stay. The cabinet submitted its resignation after an emergency cabinet meeting at 5:30 PM. Afterwards, Konoe took a train to the Emperor's summer retreat to report the cabinet's decision. The Cabinet Information Bureau announced, "It is extremely necessary to strengthen Japan's internal organization immediately. To achieve this goal, the cabinet believes a complete change is necessary." The Konoe Cabinet resigned exactly one year after taking office, which is a coincidence. The Konoe Cabinet was formed on July 17, 1940, after the resignation of the Yonai Cabinet. It is reported that Foreign Minister Matsuoka did not attend today's emergency meeting but had submitted his resignation earlier.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 16th – According to a Domei News Agency broadcast from Tokyo on the 16th, former Seiyukai President Kuhara Fusanosuke, while meeting with reporters at his private residence, stated that he has decided to resign from his position as a member of the Cabinet Advisory Committee because he still maintains some influence in political parties, which is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Chongqing Urgent Telegram, 16th – According to a Domei News Agency broadcast from Tokyo on the 16th, the Konoe Cabinet was established on July 17th of last year, succeeding the Yonai Cabinet. The resignation occurred exactly one year later. The following are the major events that occurred in Japan during this year: (1) Dissolution of all political parties and the establishment of a centralized national polity, resulting in the formation of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association"; (2) Establishment of the Tripartite Pact, uniting Japan with Germany and Italy; (3) On November 30th of last year, Japan and Nanjing signed the so-called Japan-China Basic Treaty; (4) On April 13th of this year, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, during his visit to Germany and Italy, concluded the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It is also reported that the Emperor and Empress have suspended their vacation and are scheduled to return to Tokyo tomorrow afternoon, indicating the extreme seriousness of the situation.</p>
<h3>America, Britain, China, Dutch East Indies Form Strong Front</h3>
<p>Rumors of Japan Continuing Southward Advance</p>
<p>British Forces in the Far East Prepare for Contingencies</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th – General Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Far East, speaking to a Reuters correspondent today about rumors of Japan's impending southward advance, said in a calm, resolute, and confident tone that we are fully prepared to deal with any eventuality. We are confident that there will be no shortage in the deployment of British forces in the Far East. This situation reflects the spirit of the entire democratic front in the Far East. Your correspondent's observations in China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaya over the past few months can attest to its accuracy. This front (generally referred to as the ABCD front because its constituents are America, Britain, China, and the Dutch East Indies) has no formal alliance, but all constituents have been cooperating closely under close contact for months. What can be said is that any action deemed to endanger the security of one constituent will be considered an event related to all other constituents. As for any action within the territory of a constituent of this front other than a genuine attack, the result may be to trigger "obstructive action" by other members of the front, which is naturally a closely guarded secret. However, what cannot be ignored is that if the bases in southern Vietnam are used by Japan, one of the Axis powers, it may be deemed to have a significant relationship with the Allied powers, as it would not only be a valuable attack point for attacking Malaya and Burma but would also place Borneo under crossfire from the northwest and northeast. This Borneo is partly Dutch East Indies, partly British North Borneo Company, partly British-protected but independent (i.e., Sarawak), and partly (Labuan) incorporated into the Straits Settlements government. It is a crucial location in the ABCD front, and the most logical joint base for air force cooperation between Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. Moreover, its land also contains 70% of the rich oil production of the Western Pacific Islands. According to British travelers arriving here from southern Vietnam, the French authorities there suspect that Japan has begun some action, and the situation is quite tense. However, so far, the only visible extraordinary sign is that about 50 Japanese people recently arrived there, claiming to be economic representatives. Malaya's response to the news from Vietnam is the determination to resolutely strike against any sudden action that disrupts the current state of this part of the world.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th – Many observers here believe that Japan is currently trying to carry out a two-pronged approach, on the one hand, to take action in new battlefields in Asia to enhance its own position, and on the other hand, to try to prevent the US fleet from being redeployed in the Pacific. People are paying attention to Japan's recent requisition of merchant ships and changes to the routes to important seaports near Kobe. Reliable sources say that Under Secretary of State Welles met with Australian Naval Attaché Harris, indicating that the United States is closely monitoring the military situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 16th – The Daily Herald's diplomatic correspondent Ira wrote an article yesterday commenting on Japan's most likely moves in the Far East, saying that there are many reports that Japan is planning to "lease" Vichy naval and air bases in French Indochina, including the important Cam Ranh Bay. He also said, "Those who advocate southward advance seem to believe that a sudden announcement regarding the lease of bases can be expected soon."</p>
<p>Most British and Chinese Do Not Believe in the Theory That Japan is About to Advance Southward</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 16th – According to news from foreign sources received here, the Japanese may launch an invasion of southern Vietnam in two weeks. Although the Japanese have gathered a large number of troops in Guangdong, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, preparing for this action, there are no significant movements of Japanese troops or warships at present that would suggest an imminent launch. Informed sources here mostly do not believe in the above news, believing that Japan's policy is one of cautious action and that Japan will not take any action that would trigger a major war with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but will wait until it can be determined that there will be no significant sacrifices and that something can be gained before launching. Therefore, if the German army breaks through the Soviet defense line, Japan may seize Vladivostok, or when the German army advances southward to Suez with irresistible force and threatens India, Japan will launch an attack on Singapore in the South China Sea. The only purpose of Japan's seizure of southern Vietnam will be to attack Singapore. However, although Japan can seize southern Vietnam without much difficulty at present, attacking Singapore is not yet the time. Therefore, people here believe that the future of development in the Far East will mostly depend on the Soviet-German war.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent does not believe the rumors that Japan will take some action around next month, saying that these rumors are all air released by Japan itself to test the reaction of Britain and the United States. Before making a final decision on any course of action, the Japanese government is willing to know what actions Britain and the United States will take to counter Japan's launch of an attack on the Soviet Union or any action against Vietnam. The correspondent also said that at present, the British and American governments are not only closely watching the situation and exchanging all information, but also discussing certain steps to be taken in case of emergency. The above rumors, aimed at discovering our intentions, are just enough to give us a timely warning.</p>
<p>Japan is Launching Another "Nerve War"</p>
<p>Washington, 15th – Local newspapers today prominently published news from Far Eastern newspapers that Japan is about to take action against Vietnam and Thailand. However, President Roosevelt and Under Secretary of State Welles made no formal comments at today's press briefing. Although the issue was mentioned at the State Department's press briefing, Welles said that the government had not yet received formal and detailed reports and therefore declined to comment. Most authoritative observers of Far Eastern issues generally believe that Japan is launching another "nerve war" and do not believe that this action has any serious nature. At a time when Tokyo indicates that the Soviet Union is laying mines in the territorial waters near Vladivostok and the Siberian region is facing the most tense situation, some observers still firmly believe that Japan will advance south, establish naval and air bases in Saigon and Bangkok. This move will not encounter any resistance and will allow Hitler to achieve his main hope of making it impossible for the US Pacific Fleet to be redeployed. The United States does not take Japan's latest threat in the Pacific seriously, considering it to be another empty threat from Japan. However, all parties say that the Roosevelt administration is paying the closest attention to Tokyo's next move, while strengthening the defenses of the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippines, and stepping up aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Tokyo Magazine Claims Japan is Determined to Aid Germany and Italy</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th – According to a commentary in the July issue of the widely read "Oriental Economist" magazine, if Germany and Italy are attacked by the United States, Japan must fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and provide assistance. The magazine said that the people do not want to go to war with the United States, but Japan will have to join the war against the United States in order to abide by the three guarantees made to the Axis powers. It also said that it does not matter which country, Germany or the United States, fires the first shot. The Axis powers have done everything possible to avoid provoking the United States, but American aid to Britain is tantamount to attacking the Axis. When war breaks out, Germany and Italy may fire the first shot at the United States, but it is the United States that forces Germany and Italy to fire on the United States. Based on the interpretation of the word "attack," there is only one way to assist the Axis. The magazine also said that there is little hope of improving US relations unless the problems of Japan, Germany, and Italy are resolved and a new world order is established. It is an undeniable fact that Japan is dissatisfied with the current world order. Until all dissatisfactions are resolved, it is difficult for Japan to shake hands with the United States in good faith. This is why, after years of painful struggle, the Japanese government finally recognized that forming the Tripartite Pact with the Axis powers was the only reasonable path. For this reason, if the United States and Japan one day abandon their prejudices, resolve the relationship between the two countries, and establish a new order, the danger of armed conflict between the United States and Japan can be eliminated. At that time, if the dissatisfactions of Germany and Italy are resolved, their disputes with the United States can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Japan's Industrial Production Declines</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th – The Department of Commerce reported yesterday that, according to statistics obtained, Japan's industrial production has gradually declined amid the continued stagnation of the current war in China. The report said that this decline is due to the lack of technical industry, fuel, and electricity.</p>

<h3>Three Generals Command the Battle, Red Army Launches General Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Maintained in the Belsk Area, German Advance Units in the North Annihilated</p>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 15th – Military observers here recently stated that it has been twenty-four days since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The front line is "fiercely fought," with heavy losses on both sides, and there have been major changes in the war situation. The major points are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) German troops on the northern front continue to advance towards Leningrad, but after a period of fierce fighting, the advance has slowed down. (2) German armored units on the central front advance towards Smolensk. The Red Army attacks the German left flank in the Vitebsk area and flanks the German right flank in the Mogilev area. (3) German troops on the southern front attack Kiev. The Red Army in this area, under the command of General Butny, repeatedly launches counterattacks, attacking the German-Romanian left flank with considerable success. (4) Although the resistance of the Red Army in some areas has been greatly reduced due to exhaustion, it still firmly resists in the three major theaters of war. (5) The front-line war situation has gradually become a state of prolonged mixed warfare. The Red Army adopts a "deep penetration strategy." Each time the Red Army shifts positions, it does not retreat completely but leaves a large number of assault troops behind German lines. Its intention is not to stop the enemy's advance but to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. (6) The Red Army has been ordered by Stalin to burn down towns and grains before retreating. (7) The exact positions of both sides cannot be determined until after the fall of Kiev and Leningrad. However, the German siege of Leningrad does not seem to be able to be captured overnight.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 16th – A news report from the Swedish capital was published here today that a general counteroffensive by Soviet troops on all fronts is reportedly being prepared. Marshal Voroshilov, commander of the Red Army on the northern front, has concentrated one million men to confront the German attack on Leningrad. "The Red Army will soon launch a large-scale counteroffensive along the entire front."</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 16th – Moscow Radio recently broadcast a message that the Soviet Red Army has launched a large-scale counteroffensive on a 30-kilometer-long front in the central theater of war. A large number of troops participated in the counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 15th – The Red Army General Headquarters announced in a war report that fierce fighting occurred today in the areas of Biskov, Vitebsk, and Novograd-Volynsky. German motorized units were surrounded by the Red Army in the Biskov area and completely annihilated. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Vitebsk area, with heavy losses on both sides. In the Novograd-Volynsky area, the Red Army launched a large-scale counteroffensive, and the enemy's attempts to advance eastward were all blocked by the Red Army. The Soviet Air Force was very active today, heavily bombing enemy concentration points and airfields. The Ploiesti and Sulina oil fields in Romania were also bombed by Soviet aircraft. A total of 52 German aircraft were shot down today, and the Soviet Union lost only 24. In addition, a Soviet armed fishing boat sank a German submarine in the Gulf of Finland today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – A war correspondent for the Soviet News reported this morning that the Soviet army launched a counterattack between Logachev and Mogilev (ten miles west of the Dnieper River), driving the German army to a line thirty miles west of Logachev. This news has not been confirmed by Moscow officials.</p>
<p>Taiwan News Agency, Moscow, 16th – A Soviet agency announced yesterday that the Soviet Northern Red Army has "fiercely driven back to the west" German mechanized units that had attacked within 145 miles of Leningrad. The location to where the German army was driven back was Biskov in the Pskov region. In a fierce battle, the German units were surrounded and then gradually destroyed by the Soviet army. This victory has at least temporarily destroyed the German army's spearhead-shaped incursion south of Leningrad. Therefore, it was officially declared that the Red Army, after making its largest counterattack in history, had forced the German army to retreat twenty miles behind the Dnieper River on the central front. Yesterday's Soviet news mentioned the Pskov region for the first time, which is located on a railway line 145 miles south of Leningrad and forty miles east of Biskov, east of Lake Peipus. A previous Soviet communiqué stated that the German army was rushing towards Leningrad in the Biskov region, 190 miles from Leningrad. The Soviet side admitted that fierce battles were being fought on the Leningrad front, in the Vitebsk salient 290 miles west of Moscow, and on the Ukrainian front west of Kiev. Both sides suffered heavy losses. Red Army authorities claimed that in the Vitebsk salient, German units were making futile westward advances. In the Novograd-Volynsky salient, 125 miles west of Kiev, Soviet troops were counterattacking the German incursion, while the Germans were attempting to rescue an intruding tank convoy that had advanced on the outskirts of Kiev.</p>
<p>German War News is Full of Contradictions, Claiming to Have Reached the Gates of Kiev</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – According to the latest news from Soviet and neutral sources received here, as a result of the continued firm resistance of the Soviet army, the German army has suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, and its new offensive has failed to proceed according to plan, resulting in the postponement of Hitler's timetable for the war. The intensity of the war along the 2,000-mile front has not diminished, but the German invasion is facing increasing difficulties. Swiss newspapers reported from Berlin that the progress of the German army's new offensive is not as great as they usually claim. The latest war news issued by the German official news agency is full of contradictions. It first restates the claim of breaking through the Stalin Line, and then says that there is fierce fighting in the Vitebsk area west of the line. A few days ago, the news agency claimed that the German army had almost reached the gates of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, but now it says that there is fighting between Zhytomyr and Berdychiv, about a mile southwest of Kiev.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 16th – This morning, well-informed sources here said that German troops in the north crossed the Luga River this morning, which is the last barrier to reach the port of Leningrad. Another army is attacking Kiev. The Nazi advance towards Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, was unimpeded. German news said that the three German advances, one towards Leningrad, one towards Moscow, and one towards Kiev, continued to advance. German news said that the Soviet army resisted stubbornly, while also saying that the Soviet army on each front showed signs of disintegration. German sources admitted that the war was terrible but insisted that the Soviet Union's losses were greater than Germany's.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – The German official news agency said that after fierce fighting, the German army occupied the easternmost outpost of the Stalin Line in the Vitebsk area. The news continued to describe the solidity of the outpost's structure and the difficulty of the German soldiers' attack, and pointed out that the area was an important strategic position on the central line, on the route directly to Moscow.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th – The German military authorities confirmed last night that the German army, after breaking through the Stalin Line, had advanced towards Kiev on the 14th. The severely damaged Soviet army was still trying to reinforce to stop the German offensive advancing eastward. Although the number of Soviet troops exceeded that of the German army, after three days of fighting, their plan to break through had been shattered. The Soviet troops surrounded west of Berdychiv have all been annihilated or captured. The resistance of Soviet troops in other places is weakening day by day.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th – The Soviet army launched a counterattack south of Kiev yesterday, which was blocked by the German army. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses, lost its positions, and was forced to retreat behind the Stalin Line.</p>
<p>Stalin's Eagles Show Their Might on the Front Lines, Germans Boast of Air Force Achievements</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th – On the 15th, our air force was extremely active. In addition to inflicting heavy damage on enemy mechanized units and airfields, it also heavily bombed the Ploiesti oil fields and transport ships in the Sulina-Tulcea area. Also, on the 14th, 52 enemy aircraft were shot down, and we lost 24 aircraft. Our destroyers in the Gulf of Riga shot down two enemy aircraft. An enemy submarine in the Gulf of Finland was sunk by a mine.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 15th – A radio station here announced last night that in the past 14 hours, the German Air Force shot down 72 Soviet aircraft in air combat, and 150 Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The German side lost only nine aircraft. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has lost 7,182 aircraft. In addition, the German Air Force destroyed 500 Soviet vehicles, 30 tanks, and several artillery pieces on the Smolensk front.</p>
<p>War on Two Fronts Causes Mistakes, Nazi Invasion of the Soviet Union Will Eventually Fail</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th – Soviet Information Bureau Deputy Director Lozovsky stated last night that the Nazi side's propaganda is now trying to comfort German public opinion, thinking that what they have now is only a war on one front. In fact, the Germans are now gradually realizing the mistake of attacking the Soviet Union and creating a war on two fronts, which is contrary to the advice of previous German military experts.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – According to news received by the Soviet Embassy in London, the Germans can only control areas where German troops are stationed in their occupied areas. In the rest of the area, Soviet guerrillas are rampant. The Portuguese Voz reports today that even if the Soviet army continues to retreat, it can fight indefinitely. The vast territory of the Soviet Union will force the German army to disperse and fail to win a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Soviet Paratroopers Land in Hungary, Bucharest Heavily Attacked by Soviet Air Force</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – The Italian official news agency reported from the Hungarian capital that Soviet paratroopers had landed in Hungary, destroying a railway, but were stopped by Hungarian troops. Also, although Hungarian troops on the Soviet front are suffering from a lack of roads and rugged terrain, they are now entering the Podolia region of western Ukraine. The Italian official news agency reported from Bucharest that according to a Romanian communiqué, Bucharest was attacked by air on Sunday night, and enemy aircraft dropped a large number of incendiary bombs, killing and injuring one person each.</p>
<h3>Soviet Authorities Deny Capital Relocation</h3>
<p>Evacuation of Refugees Does Not Hinder Military Operations</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th – Soviet Information Bureau Deputy Director Lozovsky, when hosting reporters last night, was asked by a Japanese reporter about the Iranian ambassador, the head of the diplomatic corps, visiting Lozovsky. Lozovsky replied that the Soviet government is not preparing to leave Moscow, and there is no need for the diplomatic corps to evacuate. Lozovsky also answered a question about refugees, saying that the Soviet railway personnel have done their best to handle the arduous task of evacuating refugees from the occupied areas to the Volga River and the Ural Mountains, which is commendable. Because the Soviet Union has a vast front line and the public abides by discipline, it has been able to prevent the congestion of refugees on highways and railways so as not to hinder military operations, as was the case in France before.</p>
<h3>Italian and Spanish Volunteer Army Head to Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Havas, Rome, 15th – The first batch of Italian volunteers sent to Germany to prepare for the war against the Soviet Union has arrived in Vienna. Top German and Italian officials welcomed them at the station.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th – The Spanish volunteer army for the war against the Soviet Union arrived in Salzburg, Germany this morning. The first part of this Blue Division has several thousand people. More will continue to arrive in the next few days. Most of the volunteers participated in the Spanish Civil War and have rich combat experience. The equipment is also quite good.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th – General Kunte, commander of the Spanish "Blue Division," arrived in Berlin yesterday, accompanied by Chief of Staff Colonel Trocoso and several generals.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union to Restore Diplomatic Relations with Yugoslavia, Greece, Belgium, and Norway</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 16th - It is reported that the Soviet Union will restore diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, Greece, Belgium, and Norway. Mr. Gavrilović is expected to leave here soon to resume his post as the Yugoslav ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Vichy Authorities Issue Statement</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 15th - The French government believes that the Anglo-French armistice agreement in Syria cannot be regarded as a political or military surrender. The French Information Agency issued a special communique today to explain, stating: "The content of the armistice agreement signed in Syria yesterday is very different from the initial version submitted by the British to the French government. The first set of conditions contained political elements that were difficult to accept, so the French government refused to consider them. However, given the situation of the French forces in Syria, it was impossible to continue the war. Therefore, General Dentz was instructed to conduct peace negotiations, but only within the scope of military matters. Subsequently, an agreement was reached between the French and British high commands, and the agreement was signed by the French representative, General de Verdillac, and the British representative, General Wilson. Our army fought bravely to defend the motherland, but due to enemy superiority in numbers and vastly superior military equipment, we had no choice but to cease fighting after our supplies were exhausted. However, we still obtained honorable terms. Our army was neither subjected to internment nor disarmed, and it was stipulated that they could return to their country freely. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a military surrender. Politically, France has neither relinquished its sovereignty in the Near East nor abandoned its traditional mission, and absolutely no clauses have been signed that would hinder France's future in the Near East."</p>
<h3>British Troops Enter Beirut</h3>
<p>Reuters, Beirut, 16th - British troops entered Beirut yesterday and were warmly welcomed by Syrians and French. When the vanguard troops advanced to the suburbs, onlookers cheered and applauded. The official entry will take place today, with Australian troops stationed in the heart of the city. Judging from the situation in the suburbs, the Vichy forces seemed determined to hold out until the last possible moment. A Reuters correspondent who entered the city visited a military hospital and saw forty wounded British prisoners of war, who all said that the French treated them with utmost kindness, beyond praise. The city is very quiet, and many roofs have been adorned with Free French flags. Few residents have moved away, as they all believe that the British army will not attack the city. Syrians and French alike feel relieved that the Nazi conspiracy and influence in the area has come to an end.</p>

<p>Chongqing - U Ba Gyi, leader of the Burmese Journalists' Delegation to China, wrote to Chinese journalists on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Such a brave spirit has long won the sympathy and admiration of the world. On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of your country's war, the entire Burmese Journalists' Delegation and other Burmese people, in addition to participating in the Yangon Overseas Chinese Commemoration of the Fourth Anniversary of Resistance and Reconstruction, extend their sincere respect to the heroic soldiers of your country who sacrificed themselves for resisting aggression and defending the motherland. I recall that last year, our delegation visited your country and witnessed the vigorous and flourishing scene of reconstruction in the rear areas, which is the most valuable fact in our life history. The fearless spirit of the people of your country makes us deeply believe that your country will achieve final victory. Recently, the bombing by Japanese aircraft has caused suffering to the general public. In addition to condemning the aggressors in conscience, we also extend our deep sympathy to the innocent victims. Since our delegation returned to Burma after visiting your country, the decision to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway between China and Burma was soon made, which made us feel extremely excited. After the completion of this road, it will not only enable Burma to provide greater assistance to your country, but also connect the cultures of the two nations and become a pioneer in close cooperation for world peace.

Guo Moruo then reported on the situation of the Soviet-German war, praising the bravery of the Soviet army. He said that the Soviet-German war has now entered a stalemate, and Hitler's boast of capturing Moscow in three weeks has become a bubble. Subsequently, Gao Linde reported on the various tense and bewildered situations in Japan after the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Finally, Liang Han Cao summarized the reports of various people and made a general conclusion, stating that the Soviet-German war is a war of right and wrong, and victory will inevitably belong to the Soviet Union.

<h3>London China Association Holds Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>London - The China Association held its annual meeting yesterday. Chairman Woodrow addressed the meeting, asking, "What kind of country will we see China become after the war?" We all determine that we must be on the side of final victory, and none of us deny that China is on our side. China must be a victorious country after the war, and there is reason to say that China helps us as we help China. Can such a China be given or accept any status other than equality? "Mr. Luo mentioned that Japan will soon have new actions, roughly the various signs of advancing southward, saying that if it were not for China's long-term war of resistance, Japan would have already done so. If Japan does have new actions now, China and Britain will cooperate more to resist aggression, and will definitely unite to resist the common enemy. The British government did not seem to pay attention to China's feelings in the past, but Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on June 18, 1940, and Foreign Secretary Eden's speech on June 11, 1941, have assumed the responsibility of amending the treaties with China based on the principle of reciprocity and equality." Mr. Luo expressed his belief that the interests of the British in this regard would not be ignored, but said that those concerned were not yet ready for the changes that must be made.

<h3>Southwest Production and Construction</h3>
<p>— Ba Yu</p>
<p>(Our Chongqing Airmail Dispatch) The interior is not as prosperous as the cities, nor does it consume like the cities. The interior is working hard on construction, burying itself in improvements, sowing the seeds of growth everywhere, gradually cultivating, and reaping the harvests. Sichuan Province's silk, Guizhou Province's tung oil, and the agricultural and water conservancy projects in Guizhou, Hunan, and other provinces are all actively engaged in increasing production. All of these are the clarion call to awaken consumers. The recent economic construction projects in various provinces are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sichuan Has One Hundred Counties Suitable for Silkworm Rearing and Mulberry Planting</p>
<p>Before the war, Sichuan Province's silk production accounted for 13.9% of the country's total. More than one hundred counties in Sichuan are suitable for silkworm rearing and mulberry planting, mainly in northern Sichuan. According to the Sichuan Silk Organization and Collation Association's investigation, the estimated silk production is about 400,000 to 500,000 dan per year. In the past two years, organizations such as the Sichuan Silk Organization and Collation Association, Sichuan Silk Industry Company, Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute, Silk Experiment Station, Sericulture Promotion Association, and Southern Sichuan Mulberry Leaf Research Office have been actively improving sericulture production and marketing, achieving considerable results. However, the control methods still need much adjustment. In addition, the Sichuan Provincial Government is planning to set up several demonstration factories to improve agricultural implements, with a capital of 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Coal, Iron, Gold, Silver, Copper, Tin—Yunnan Has Them Everywhere</p>
<p>Yunnan Province is rich in mineral resources, such as coal, iron, gold, silver, copper, tin, tungsten, zinc, and other minerals, which are almost everywhere. Salt rock is also abundant. The Yunnan Provincial Government has now established the Western Yunnan Enterprise Bureau, Yunnan Mining Company, Cement Plant, etc. In addition to prospecting for ore deposits, gold mining is being developed locally. In addition, a Western Yunnan Tropical Crop Experiment Center has been established between the transportation lines of Longling, Baoshan, and Mangshi. A Tung Forest Center has been established in the Kuhe Dam area of Baoshan and Changning.</p>
<p>Guizhou Province Focuses on Agricultural Production, Tung Flowers All Over the Mountains</p>
<p>Guizhou Province has stipulated that grain production must increase by 2.241 million dan this year, and detailed implementation measures have been formulated. The province was originally the strongest advocate for planting tung trees, and even designated tung flowers as the provincial flower, with April 1st as the Tung Flower Festival every year. Anyone who has set foot in Guizhou Province can see tung flowers all over the mountains on a sunny day. The province has planted tung trees on one million mu of land, with a production of at least about 500,000 city dan. The provincial government has now decided to expand the area of oil tung cultivation by 1.5 million mu within five years.</p>
<p>Leiyang Manufactures Matches, Pingba Establishes a Farm</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural construction in Hunan Province, in addition to focusing on planting tung trees, non-rice crops such as peppers, sugarcane, and tobacco, which were originally planted in the Shaoyang area, have been banned and replaced with indica rice. In the industrial sector, a match factory has started operations in Leiyang. The provincial government has also invested 600,000 yuan to restore a paper mill and establish a medical supplies and equipment manufacturing plant. The Guizhou Provincial Government has recently decided with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to establish a state-run Guizhou Farm in Pingba, with an initial operating cost of 400,000 yuan, to gradually improve agriculture in Guizhou Province.</p>
<p>Various Factories in Guangdong Province Are Being Revived in Large Numbers</p>
<p>Guangdong Province is currently reviving various factories, including machine manufacturing and repair factories, soap factories, absorbent cotton factories, paper-making demonstration factories, alcohol factories, iron-smelting factories, etc. Private factories in areas such as Qujiang, Lechang, Nanxiong, and Shixing, such as oil presses, paper mills, and textile factories, are also increasing production. As for agriculture, Guangdong Province has a mild climate and fertile land, so it is actively promoting increased grain production, with good results.</p>
<p>Ash-Soil Replaces Cement, with Exceptionally Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>The need for cement in the interior is very urgent. Now, ash-soil has been invented to replace cement. The main components are ceramic powder and slaked lime. The raw materials are clay and limestone, which are fired separately, then one is ground into powder and the other is slaked with water. The manufacturing method is to first select the quality of the clay, that is, to fire the kiln clay, crush the fired clay into ceramic gravel, and then grind it into powder. Slaked lime is also made by firing the lime, adding one-thirteenth to one-half of water, and then mixing it with mechanical force to form slaked lime. After the slaked lime is stored in a warehouse for ten days, it will naturally become a powder of appropriate fineness. Then, the two raw materials are ground into powder and mixed together to become a substitute for cement. Its advantages are that the compressive strength is the same as cement for 28 days, and the final pressure is the same as cement. Now, various places are approving the manufacturing on a large scale, and the results can be said to be satisfactory.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Speculation Divergent Views Bearish Due to Weak Actual Sales, High Prices Immediately Drop Bullish Due to High Raw Cotton Prices, Guangdong Sales Not Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market has moved from fluctuation to stability, but speculators generally have divergent views. The bearish side is due to weak actual sales recently, and the second reason is that the peak is found twice, and it often immediately falls back. As for the bulls, they see that the price of American cotton overseas is rising steadily, and considering the raw materials, the yarn price really has no major decline. Although the trading of 20-count yarn in Guangdong is sluggish, the demand for 32-count single yarn continues, and the selling price is still increasing, averaging 2,200 yuan. Foreign factories have low profits from spinning 20-count yarn, so they plan to reduce the number of spindles and increase the work of spinning 32-count yarn, which will inevitably be implemented. Therefore, the ideals of the industry are roughly like this. If the price falls, they will still absorb it and not let it go. The high price of Double Horse 20-count yarn is 1,596 yuan, and the low price is 1,580 yuan. In the early afternoon, the first transaction was 1,576 yuan, which rose to 1,590 yuan, reportedly because large speculators bought it after the morning closing.</p>
<p>The strange news that the Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9 factories were taken over came and went inexplicably. Unexpectedly, the whirlwind brought down the yarn number, desperately selling nearly a thousand pieces short (Double Horse yarn), and the margin received from the bullish side reached more than 100,000 yuan (150 yuan margin per piece of yarn). As a result, the low price of 1,520 yuan that day was like a flash in the pan, gradually rising back to 1,560-1,570 yuan. The shorts intended to "close the door and win big", so the (bullish) customers who bought from the yarn number through agents in the industry were implicated, losing both the principal and the interest. They had to compensate the margin and the profits they earned to the customers. The yarn number that was implicated could only complain endlessly. (Ju)</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the strong upward trend of the afternoon of the previous day, and the first transaction price was 1,596 yuan. A certain major player bought according to the market, and the amount was already huge. However, the general traders believed that the 1,600 yuan mark could not be broken, and they were afraid that it was still in the range. The scalpers mostly grabbed short hats, so there were more sellers and fewer buyers for a while, and it immediately fell to 1,585 yuan. However, profitable households actively made up for it, and it rose again to 1,590 yuan. Subsequently, in view of the weak actual sales and the flat market in the exchange, and rumors of a sudden drop, it fell to 1,580 yuan. The closing price was 1,582 yuan. The statistics of the turnover in half a day were 6,255 bales. The amount bought by each port is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Today, 2,870 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the Double Horse futures yarn market saw the bulls closing out in the near term and the shorts covering in the far term. The market price was weaker in the near term and stronger in the far term, rising or falling by 2 to 4.5 yuan compared to yesterday. After the opening, it was heard that American cotton was rising more and more fiercely, and many new buyers and short coverings appeared. July reached as high as 1,440.5 yuan, August 1,456 yuan, and September 1,524 yuan. Afterwards, due to the decline in both foreign exchange and gold prices, and the lack of improvement in customer sales, the bulls started to sell off, and the market price suddenly turned downward, gradually falling to a low closing price. In the afternoon, each fell by 6 to 9.5 yuan. The turnover was 7,940 bales. The market continued to be weak at the beginning of the after-market, and then rebounded slightly. As a result, July fell by 1 yuan compared to the previous day, August remained unchanged, and September rose by 1.5 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 12,060 bales, a decrease of 4,180 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the whole day are recorded on the left (net quotation).</p>
<h3>American and Indian Cotton Markets Soar Foreign Cotton Orders Greatly Increase</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has seen less trading recently, but the momentum is still tight. This is because the American cotton price is rising sharply, rising day by day, which has made people excited. Generally, those who hold coarse and fine goods are unwilling to sell them, so although the transaction is not frequent, there is still a keen search for some of them.</p>
<p>Indian cotton also has Jardine Matheson's Taishun, which arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 3,050 pieces of cotton from Calcutta, India, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose because of damage to the cotton crop, and then rose sharply due to buying by the industry and excessive rainfall. As a result, the closing price rose by about 23-24 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to continuous buying of spot goods by European exporters and speculators, but then fell slightly due to selling by brokers and profit-taking by bulls. Yesterday's closing prices each rose by 3-4 rupees.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that the opening market today will be 3.75 rupees higher.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai foreign cotton trade market is firm and rising, and orders are enthusiastic. Recently, due to the soaring prices of American and Indian cotton, and the tight spot goods in Shanghai, people from all parties are quite excited, and even the water feet are competing for interest, so orders are enthusiastic. Yesterday, the various flower numbers and foreign merchants sold more than a thousand bales of Brazilian cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Industry Statistics for Last Month</h3>
<p>New York Electric, the Bureau of Statistics announced, American cotton industry statistics for June are recorded on the left (unit of flower clothes is thousand bales, unit of spindles is thousand spindles).</p>
<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Tightens and Loosens, Ultimately No Honor or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed exchange rates. The black market exchange rate for the British pound was fixed. The US dollar turned from tight to flat, and immediately after the morning opening, Chinese speculators came to grab it, and the US dollar immediately tightened to 5.28125 yuan. However, after 10 o'clock, Japanese banks sold again, causing the August futures to loosen to 5.34375 yuan to close. HSBC and American banks absorbed it, and the closing exchange rates were the same as the closing prices of the previous night. The turnover in half a day was quite strong. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Japanese Dump Still Not Finished</p>
<p>Since the early morning foreign telegram, the Bank of England's near term is long and the far term is flat, the Bank of America has not changed, the Indian Bank is flat, and the futures are down in the near term and long in the far term.

The HSBC listing has not changed, and the silver equalization tax has been increased by half a point, calculated at 23.75%. Japanese banks suddenly came to sell spot goods to August 5.3125 yuan, and then sold 5.34375 yuan, which was absorbed by HSBC and Citibank. It was difficult to sell at the most lenient price and could be closed. The mid-hour trend stabilized, and the mid-closing spot goods to the August period were all British pounds, three-tenths of a cent, two, three, four, three, seven, five, and the US dollar (selling price of foreign banks) was 5.3125 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<h3>Gold Market is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the black market turned weak, and the price has retreated to the 6,500 yuan mark. The foreign exchange has turned from tight to flat, and the securities and gold industries have come out and added to the selling pressure. The people's minds have turned downward.

The decoration gold is still flat.</p>
<h3>Food A Large Amount of Javanese Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Rice Prices Also Down a Little by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to show a range-bound appearance in a weak wind. The opening of the market in the early morning inherited the falling wind of consecutive days, and the buying sentiment was very lax. The accumulation of foreign rice and the long-term stagnation of customers have made it difficult for the rice market to turn around. In addition, the small scale in Hong Kong has led to the crowding of rice. The actual sales of shops and factories in this street no longer need to ask the market. And the fixed price is generally planned. Chinese and foreign merchants continue to sell, and all kinds of rumors are unfavorable to the buyers. Therefore, those who hold the goods after the opening are very loose in their sales intentions. The timid and the profit-taking retail investors depreciate and close out, making the market unable to support it. The market once dropped by two or three yuan, and then the price was low, which caused the inland customers and the skin ball gang to take advantage of the low price to absorb it. Before the closing, it rose by one or two yuan again, but the result was finally one or two yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The small scale in July was from 148 yuan to 149 yuan, now 148 yuan to 147.5 yuan, broken rice 1078 yuan, Siamese No. 2 139 yuan to 141 yuan. The total turnover for the day was about 700 tons, and the spot rice turnover was more than 20,000 bags, and the market price varied. The small pattern opened at 120 yuan and was small to 119.2 yuan, followed by 118 yuan. The afternoon market returned from 120 yuan to 121.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Java foreign rice of Da Jing arrived in port. The Zhigen Di of the Zha Hua Shipping Company arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 40,000 bags of foreign rice from Java, and docked at the Puxiang Blue Smoke stack for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice at the Bureau's average price from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Fusheng transported 1,124 bags of foreign rice from this city to Tianjin yesterday. The Zesha Road Asia wheel, which arrived in port the day before, also carried more than 2,000 bags of maize from Java and docked at the Blue Smoke stack (Zu).</p>
<p>The thick and thin japonica rice, due to rain, was blocked from arriving at each port, and the people's minds were suddenly exhausted. The sales in the hometown store were relaxed, and the cargo owners' selling intentions were also relaxed, resulting in a sudden drop in the price of Yuan Yu. The fresh early and late rice in Kai Nan Port was 141.5 yuan to 139 yuan, and the second-rate goods with a night were 134 yuan. The Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice was 1334 yuan, and the overnight japonica rice was 130 yuan, zero angle to 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice and other goods were consistently weak, and the market situation followed the decline, especially the glutinous rice in the country, which suddenly became hot due to the weather, and the steaming was abnormal, and the quality of the goods suddenly changed, making it difficult to put it on hold. The cargo owners were scrambling to get rid of it, and the price fell more severely, calculated at more than three yuan. The opening was high from 124 yuan to 122 yuan. As for Hong Kong Baiyuan, it was patient and only depreciated by Yuan Yu. The opening was high from 124 yuan to 119 yuan, glutinous tea 1134 yuan, especially 115 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Public Debt Inflow and Outflow The Wall Between Bulls and Bears is Considerable</h3>
<p>In the public debt black market, although there was a surge of investors yesterday, the atmosphere was very strong, but the market price could not exceed the closing price of the previous day. The price of C was broken again at two yuan. It seemed that the bullish front line was too high, and the sellers were scattered soldiers. The large number of goods that a certain silver bank had recently received, as represented by the former representative of the number, also began to be sold yesterday. The bulls' repeated additions to their positions were all based on the bank's mortgage as a back door. The interest they bear is to increase the cost of entering goods, and is used by the left and right. It is difficult to return to the original state, and I don't know how to make it good. Yesterday morning, the buying side included Renfeng Run, Hu Heji, Yi Zhong, and Xie Xing Yuan. Among them, Xie Xing Yuan bought the most, with the remaining courage worth selling. Not willing to show weakness, the selling side was mostly Xinhua Zhongfu. Yi Tai, Ding Kang, Tongshun, Xie Da, Le Mao, Defu, and Jiu Feng had different amounts, and most of them were bulls coming out of the cage. Therefore, the spot goods were quite abundant after the noon closing, and the closing price was lower than the previous day. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan bought another 600,000, with the image of fighting with one's back to the city. Heng Kang, Da Zhong, Chong Fu, Run De, and Yi Ji all made trades, and Yu Da took the opportunity to sell a little. Hong Da and Yi Chang also sold a lot, and Run Li and Ren Chang also sold a lot. The market was in oversupply, and C broke two yuan again. Although the price drop was limited, the trend was not good. Because the big players repeatedly bought, the people's minds were not excited, but they had a good price to sell. As a result, except for D, which was still slightly better by one corner, the rest fell by one corner to two and a half corners. The turnover was about 2.45 million yuan. A simple and clear table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock transactions, 1,000 shares of Hengli Bank stock were traded at a price of eight yuan (par value of ten yuan).</p>
<p>The opening of various industry stocks was firm, and they began to fall back near the closing. Rubber stocks were quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Jardine Matheson Coarse Cloth Factory Disk Increases Again</h3>
<p>Factory cloth The market was firm yesterday, and people were watching. The cloth price was trending upward. The factory's opening price was tightening due to cost reasons. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth factory disk increased again by two yuan to two and a half yuan per piece. Lun Chang factory's stock-out goods, bleached cloth, straight tribute satin, and other hand goods also increased by five corners to one yuan per piece. The white goods, coarse and fine cloth, twill, had mixed rises and falls of one or two corners. Some of the color cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin continued to rise by about five corners. The turnover of each cloth on this street was more than 600 pieces. The Nanyang Gang Guangdong and Hong Kong offices had more than 200 pieces of color cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. On the 17th, there were 1,650 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse White Stable Dutch Sugar Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of coarse white sugar was stable, and the rise and fall were very small. The upper gear of car white was flat and the lower gear was tight. The association's pricing, the spot price of the March imported 24 coarse white was 93 yuan and eight corners, one small corner, the April price was 94 yuan to four yuan and two corners, up two corners, the May 30 imported price was 94 yuan and nine corners, the June 6 imported price was 95 yuan to five yuan and one corner, the June 26 imported price was 95 yuan, four corners to seven corners, and the July 20 single price was 96 yuan, two corners, one corner, to six yuan.

The January arrival of Dutch red was 74 yuan, four corners to six corners, and the June 6 arrival was 95 yuan, seven or eight corners. The Taikoo Chegu B Mark was 118.5 yuan, and there was no transaction, which was looser than before. The lower gear rose by several corners, HX Mark Dongzhan was 93 yuan, seven or eight corners, new goods 94 yuan to four yuan, one or two corners, and those who could issue a single were 94 yuan, one or two corners.</p>
<p>A large batch of Dutch sugar arrived in Shanghai. The Zeshalu Asia steamship of Zha Hua Company arrived in port the day before (15th), carrying more than 20,000 bags of sand sugar from Java. Yesterday morning, the Zhigen Di wheel arrived in Shanghai, also carrying more than 40,000 bags of sugar from Java. Both wheels were docked at the Qichang stack in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Soybean Oil Rises by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean oil continued to rise sharply, because the source was still lacking. The local oil presses also stopped work due to the low cake price, so the sellers were very popular, and the market price rose by about two yuan. The price of raw oil and refined oil fluctuated slightly due to the mutual swallowing of the hoarders. The Tongshi sold 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, more than 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil, and more than 4,000 dan of refined oil (the price is detailed in the market price column).</p>

<h3>Improving China's Transportation System American Aid Supplies Will Reach Smoothly Experts and Technicians Will Come to China One After Another to Work Increasing Efficiency Can Be Expected to Achieve Victory Soon</h3>
<p>The United States is providing thorough assistance to China, which is part of the ABC front, and in order to strengthen the combat mechanism stationed on the Pacific outpost, China has been included in the Lend-Lease Act in addition to material assistance, making China a stronger and more unified country with the support of the United States.</p>
<p>Many Transportation Experts Come to China</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News published a commentary yesterday on the arrival of American transportation experts in China, saying that American transportation experts Arnold Dean Hillman and Davis III are currently in Chongqing, working with the Yunnan-Burma Highway Committee to conduct a detailed investigation of the road and transportation conditions in Zayue. Washington also conveyed good news, saying that after they return to the United States, the United States will send 30 transportation experts to China to improve the current highway system so that it can smoothly transport the huge amount of aid supplies transported to China in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>New Aircraft Arrive in China</p>
<p>The New York Times's interview telegram stationed in Chongqing also conveyed Davis's words, saying that China has purchased 1,000 two-and-a-half-ton trucks from the United States. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's new adviser Lattimore said when he passed through Manila a few days ago, "China is indeed within the American Lend-Lease program." New American aircraft, American pilots, and anti-aircraft guns have already arrived in western China, and there are various reasons to believe that American aid will be able to reach its destination.</p>
<p>Japan Recognizes That the Overall Situation is Becoming More Serious</p>
<p>The fact that American personnel are now talking about aid to China openly and without reservation is enough to warn Japan of what kind of development will happen soon. Intimidation tactics are not enough to prevent American aid to the Nationalist Government of China in Chongqing, and Japanese leaders are warning their people that the international situation is becoming more serious, which shows that they finally understand that they have led the people into a predicament. At the same time, Tokyo's propaganda machine is trying to arouse public opposition to French Indochina in order to divert public attention from the stalemate in the Chinese war and use this as an excuse to intensify restrictions on the war against China.</p>
<p>Wartime Transportation is Extremely Important</p>
<p>The American transportation experts who have arrived in China are of course only the advance team of other experts and technicians who are about to follow in China. Transportation is extremely important in wartime. Providing assistance in this area can correct one of China's weaknesses in combat. The aid and munitions that the United States will supply to China have been increasing, and there are also the necessary tools to transport these aid supplies. The Chinese army under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek can rely on this to achieve victory soon. Of course, everyone in the world hopes that China will do its best to repel the invaders as much as possible, and China's receipt of the aid and war equipment promised by the United States will indeed be able to drive out the invaders soon.</p>
<p>The Dawn of Freedom is Finally Realized</p>
<p>China's transportation system will receive assistance from the United States and increase its efficiency, as an initial preparation for future major operations. This is truly gratifying news. It will be able to exert its power in the future, and it can be predicted that China can now firmly embrace confidence, look forward to the future, and know that its dark period has passed, and the dawn of freedom has finally appeared on the horizon. China relies on self-reliance and the assistance of the Allied countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Victory is in sight. I would like to encourage the transportation experts.</p>
<h3>Luo Lianyan Was Kidnapped Last Week</h3>
<p>Legislator Luo Lianyan retired to Shanghai after the war, absolutely not asking about politics. Because he is a devout Christian, he is enthusiastic about serving the church and working hard for social undertakings. There are no other activities. His learning and morality are admired by both Chinese and foreigners. On the 12th of this month, he was kidnapped from his residence at No. 5 Sanyifang, Jisi Feier Road.</p>
<h3>White Russian Emigrants in Shanghai Share a Common Hatred</h3>
<p>Willing to Unite with Red Russia</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that the broadcaster of the Nazi radio station "Voice of Europe" in this port has attacked the Chai La newspaper, which is hosted by the White Russians, on the grounds that the newspaper has advocated that the Red and White Russians should unite to oppose the German army's large-scale offensive. The broadcaster also recounted the murder of Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family in Katlinburg, and then listed other reasons, saying that it was a mistake for the White Russians to sympathize with the Soviet Union. However, according to reliable Russian face-to-face interviews here, the views of the Chai La newspaper are the claims of the majority of Russian overseas Chinese in this port. Now, the Germans want to achieve their provocative tricks among the Russians with different political views, which only shows their hard work and clumsy skills. As everyone knows, it is true that the Russians have different political views. However, whether it is Red Russia or White Russia, they are all ashamed of the ravaging of the country, so they are willing to unite to resist foreign enemies.</p>
<h3>One Million Yen in Government Bonds Still Not Sold Out</h3>
<p>Local Japanese Overseas Chinese Are Accused</p>
<p>The Japanese Daily News said that local Japanese agencies had undertaken to promote the sale of one million yen in Japanese wartime government bonds. Since the sale began on June 14 by various Japanese banks in this city, it has been a month now, but they have not been sold out. The relevant parties attach great importance to this due to the poor results, and intend to record the remedial measures. At the same time, it is pointed out that this poor result is clear evidence that local Japanese overseas Chinese completely lack "self-discipline".</p>
<h3>From the Dutch East Indies, German Nationals Evacuated from Shanghai to Shandong Province; Seventy Staying in Shanghai Will Move to a Sanatorium</h3>
<p>Six hundred and sixty-six German women and children from the Dutch East Indies arrived in Shanghai on the 10th of this month aboard the Tajima-maru. Among them, 199 disembarked in Shanghai and stayed at the German School at No. 1 Avenue Haig. Of these, 47 left Shanghai by ship on Monday for Qingdao. A second group of 45 will depart for Jiaozhou on July 20th. The remaining 70 women and children staying in Shanghai will be taken care of by the German Consulate in the coming days and moved to the former Shanghai Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road.</p>
<h3>Japan Highly Values US-Soviet Cooperation, Deeply Fears the Two Countries Will Take Consistent Action on Pacific Issues in the Future</h3>
<p>A special correspondent for the North China Daily News in Japan, Whyte Owen, telegraphed from Tokyo on the 15th of this month, stating that the Japanese here are not surprised by the signing of the Anglo-Soviet pact, considering it an inevitable product of the current situation to enable joint action against a common enemy. The Japanese believe this has little impact on Japan, its influence being limited to the two signatory countries. What the Japanese are paying attention to now is the issue of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, as the two countries will increasingly cooperate closely on Pacific issues and the transport of war materials from Vladivostok to the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet authorities have suddenly declared the waters off the coast of Kamchatka and the Sea of Japan as dangerous navigation zones and laid underwater mines in the area to prevent attacks by German submarines, which the Japanese side highly values. This attitude of the Japanese side is quite thought-provoking. It is further learned here that Berlin has instructed German export merchants in Shanghai not to dump their stocks, as the German authorities vainly believe that after May, they will be able to collect their goods from Siberia and transport them back.</p>
<h3>Fair-Priced Rice from the French Concession Has Arrived; Fuel Prices Begin to Fall; Government Rice Priced at 89 Yuan Per Stone; Coal Briquette Retail Prices Still Vary</h3>
<p>The authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession are taking various steps to remedy the serious crisis in the food supply for the citizens. It is reported that the rice ordered by the French Municipal Council from Saigon arrived in this port the day before yesterday. The price is said to be set at 89 yuan per stone, which will be sold in both concessions at the same time as the small polished rice priced at 116 yuan by the Public Works Department of the International Settlement. It is now heard that more is expected to arrive continuously.</p>
<p>Over 20,000 Tons of Coal Arrive in Recent Days</p>
<p>According to reporters, large quantities of coal have been continuously shipped to this port from the production areas in recent days, including over 7,000 tons of Mentougou white coal, 6,500 tons of Korean Heiling fines, 2,500 tons of Vietnamese Hongji coal, and over 4,000 tons of Haifeng white coal, totaling over 20,000 tons. Most of the above coal was transported by large coal companies in this port using chartered ships, so the cost is lower. Since this coal arrived in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Coal Briquettes and Fines Have All Fallen in Price</p>
<p>The coal market has seen a sudden increase in spot goods and prices have fallen continuously. Haifeng coal blocks No. 1, 2, and 3 have all fallen to below 440 yuan per ton, and Heiling fines have fallen back to around 200 yuan per ton. Due to the fall in the price of coal fines, the cost of coal briquettes has also been greatly reduced. The daily sales volume has recently decreased from over 1,000 tons to over 700 tons. Yesterday, major coal briquette factories reduced the factory price of coal briquettes to 296 yuan. However, the retail prices of coal briquettes varied greatly, with prices ranging from 15 to 16 yuan per dan, which is quite inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Conditions for Releasing the "Guangdong"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the British ship "Guangdong" has been detained by the Japanese military authorities since the 10th of this month and has not yet been released. Regarding this matter, it is heard that British consular officials will soon meet with Japanese consular officials to discuss the release of the ship. According to Akiyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, the Japanese military will release the ship after removing the cargo carried by the "Guangdong" and inspecting it. It is also heard that the time for inspecting the cargo has not been decided. If the Japanese authorities believe that the cargo is not being transported to Chongqing after the meeting between the British and Japanese consular officials, then the "Guangdong" can be expected to be released. It is noted that the "Guangdong" was loading machinery for export on July 10th, and the Japanese military authorities suspected that the machinery belonged to the Chongqing government, so they detained the "Guangdong" at Wusongkou.</p>
<h3>Telephone Workers' Strike Successfully Resolved</h3>
<p>Electrical Department Workers Resume Work Yesterday</p>
<p>Arrested Workers All Released</p>
<p>A total of 1,700 workers in the electrical and telephone departments of the Shanghai Telephone Company had made demands to the company due to high prices and the pressure of living, requesting the company to withdraw its decision to lay off employees and to generally increase wages from May onwards, with a rice subsidy of one stone per person per month, based on the price of Saigon rice on the 25th of each month. The Political Department of the International Settlement, in order to eliminate this unnecessary dispute, immediately tried to mediate fairly and resolved the matter, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that 700 workers in the electrical department have resumed work since yesterday morning. The strike has now been completely resolved. It is learned that more than ten workers, including Wang Jisheng and Xiao Rubao, who were arrested on the 14th, have also been released from the police station and resumed work.</p>

<h3>Last European Mail Arrives in Shanghai Before the Soviet-German War</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, European mail to Shanghai, except from the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, has been rerouted via the United States. Yesterday, a batch of European mail arrived in Shanghai, sent by Germany, Italy, France, and other countries at the end of last month, probably the last batch of mail before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war.

British and Soviet merchants in this city are greatly encouraged by the news reported in recent days. The stocks of various British commercial and industrial enterprises in Shanghai have been soaring in recent days, such as Jardine Matheson, Union Insurance Society of Canton, Ewo, and Shanghai Dock and Engineering Company. This symbolizes the increased faith of the general public in Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>Incident of Japanese Naval Truck Driver Being Shot in Hankou; Shanghai Spokesman Explains the Course of Events; Claims Four Demands Have Been Made</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy here stated yesterday (the 15th) that after a Japanese naval truck driver was shot in Hankou on the 12th of this month, the Japanese military authorities have made the following demands to the French Concession Municipal Council of Hankou: (1) The French Municipal Council apologizes for the incident; (2) Punish the shooter, the captor, and all other relevant personnel; (3) Compensate the deceased; (4) Guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future. The Japanese authorities have not yet received a response from the French authorities, so the matter has not yet been concluded.</p>
<p>Language Barrier Led to the Incident</p>
<p>The spokesman also described the course of events, stating that a truck driver hired by the Japanese Navy was being transferred to another location, so he and five companions drank freely at a bar near the Deming Restaurant in the French Concession. At 3:15 AM, they returned home and encountered a Vietnamese policeman on the way. Presumably due to a language barrier, a dispute arose. In just one or two minutes, the Japanese boarded a naval truck and attempted to leave. The Vietnamese policeman blew a whistle and summoned several policemen, who opened fire, causing the truck driver to be shot in the chest, abdomen, and left arm, and his stomach was also cut with a knife. Although he was rushed to the hospital, he died at 6:10 AM. Another Japanese man was also cut by broken glass. The other four Japanese men were not injured. The French Municipal Council denied responsibility for the shooting, but later admitted that the truck driver died from gunshot and knife wounds. None of the Japanese men were carrying weapons. The Vietnamese policeman claimed that two Vietnamese policemen were wounded by bullets, but they must have been shot by bullets fired by other policemen. After the incident, five Japanese men were detained by the French authorities for questioning and released at 10:50 PM that day. Although the matter has not been resolved, the Japanese side has not imposed a blockade on the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Request Another Price Increase</h3>
<p>Streetcars, etc., Increased by 60%</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Only Increased by One-Seventh</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department of the International Settlement approved an increase of 20 cents in rickshaw fares, the overall rickshaw industry believes that the increase in the prices of metal and rubber has reached more than double. However, the approved price increase for streetcars and buses, which also belong to the transportation industry, reached 60%, while the rickshaw industry was only approved for an increase of one-seventh. Therefore, they expressed dissatisfaction with the current increase and requested the trade association to once again request the authorities to reconsider in order to maintain business operations.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Actual Sales of Silk and Satin; Weaving Factories Reduce Work Hours</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the center of China's silk weaving industry. Power looms were installed as early as 1915. Currently, factories such as Mayar are using the latest American-made power looms. There are hundreds of large and small factories in Shanghai. The silk weaving factories can be divided into two categories: (1) Factories that weave both natural silk and rayon fabrics; (2) Factories that weave only crepe de chine. After the war, these factories were concentrated in the safe areas of the concessions. Recently, due to the absolute ban on the import of rayon fabrics into the free areas of the rear, and the sharp decline in sales in the South Sea Islands due to the current situation, combined with the scarcity of overseas vessels, exorbitant freight rates, strict restrictions on electricity in the concessions, and a sharp increase in workers' wages, resulting in huge cost expenditures, major silk weaving factories in Shanghai have already stopped operating night shifts, and some small factories have completely stopped both day and night shifts. It is heard that the larger factories, in addition to stopping night shifts, are planning to further reduce daytime working hours in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. Sales in Shanghai itself are far below last year. The price of blue silk fabrics has soared, and the retail price of real silk fabrics is constantly above 4 or 5 yuan per foot. The future is very bleak.</p>
<h3>A Western Policeman from the Jing'an Temple Police Station Was Killed While Patrolling During the Day; Ambushed at the Intersection of Dahua Road and Maibian Road; Shot in the Head and Died; Strict Orders to Apprehend the Culprit</h3>
<p>A shooting occurred near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:30 PM. The victim was a Western policeman from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who was shot twice in the head and died on the spot. The details are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund: Common Across All Social Strata, Group Donations Finally Accumulate into a Towering Sandcastle, Kunming University Students Save on Food and Clothing to Contribute</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's reader scholarship fund has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life yesterday. The amount received exceeded five hundred yuan. Every little helps, and a large sum will be available soon. This makes our colleagues excited and cautious, so that the disaster-stricken children can have the chance to learn. Your good deeds are truly worth cherishing.</p>
<p>Reader Donations Flowing Continuously</p>
<p>Here are the titles of the donors listed below: Zhao Jinbo 200 yuan, Anonymous 100 yuan, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Jue, Yuan Cong jointly 50 yuan, Lu Huiyuan 20 yuan, Xiong Shengzhi 10 yuan, Wu Shaoen 10 yuan, Sun Zhonggan Tang 10 yuan, Sun Peiran 10 yuan, Jin Youde 10 yuan, Zhuang Zhixue 5 yuan, Huang Xiaoshi 5 yuan, Chen Anonymous 5 yuan, Lin Xiongxian 5 yuan, Yu Anonymous 5 yuan, Kong Anonymous, Fang Anonymous, Le Ji, Sun Anonymous, Zhao Tingfang, Jiang Zhongji, Luo Hongtao each 2 yuan, totaling 504 yuan, plus the previous total of 2,620 yuan and two jiao (excluding monthly and annual donations).</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Sun Finds the Greatest Joy in Doing Good</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Sun of Beile Road sent a letter to our newspaper yesterday, saying that the scholarship fund benefits poor students and has immeasurable merit. Although I am old and weak, I would never dare to lag behind others in doing good. I have specially saved one hundred yuan and ask you to send someone to collect the money. I will also try my best to persuade relatives and friends to participate in this grand undertaking. As the saying goes, doing good is the greatest joy, and I believe everyone shares this feeling.</p>
<p>University Student Speaks Earnestly</p>
<p>Mr. Geng, a reader of our newspaper, wrote a letter saying that the Shen Bao's initiative to establish a scholarship fund demonstrates its spirit of serving the public and its enthusiasm for benefiting the young. It is inspiring. I have just graduated from university and came to Shanghai from Kunming, and I am fortunate to have found a place to stay. I am willing to donate ten yuan per month, in addition to my expenses for food and clothing. I will personally deliver it at the beginning of each month without fail. I will also try to persuade my friends to contribute, so that every little helps. In this time of national crisis, this is also a way to repay the country, even if it's only a small contribution.</p>
<p>Bank Employee Extends His Compassion to Others</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Hongtao of a certain bank said that since the Shen Bao initiated the scholarship fund, I have been deeply moved. People today, even if their own children are as dull as oxen, still bear all the expenses, but they turn a blind eye to poor children who are eager to learn but cannot afford to attend school. They stand by and watch. This is truly what King Hui of Liang meant when he said, "What is in their hearts?" I am limited in my ability and cannot provide much assistance. Therefore, I call on my colleagues to raise thirty-nine yuan and send it along with this letter. My colleagues are deeply ashamed of the small amount of the donation and do not wish to leave their names. Our newspaper greatly admires Mr. Luo's good intentions. It is good to do one's best, and collective donations can easily reach a round number. We sincerely hope that compatriots in all industries in Shanghai will rise up and follow his example.</p>
<p>Little Child Speaks Even More Innocently</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Master Huang Xiaoshi also sent a handwritten letter yesterday, with very interesting wording: "I heard Dad say that the Shen Bao initiated a scholarship fund. Dad wanted to donate some money, but unfortunately, life is difficult now. Poor people really don't have the strength. Why don't the rich people get involved? I said that I saved more than five yuan from my candy money this year, so I will donate it. Anyway, I won't eat candy anymore. Dad heard it and clapped his hands in approval. Mom also laughed..." Dear little brother, I wish you great progress in your studies.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates Overseas Chinese School Teachers with Many Years of Service, Awards First, Second, and Third Class Certificates</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education ordered overseas Chinese schools to submit the names of full-time teachers who have served in the school for more than ten consecutive years. The Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for awarding teachers for their service and will issue first, second, and third class service certificates to encourage them. Because the service of teachers in overseas Chinese schools is the same as that in China, they should also be encouraged.

<h3>Fujian Province Relief, Overview of Student Life</h3>
<p>(Yong'an, 15th Dispatch) Recently, someone spread rumors that after the price changes in various places since the start of the war, the lives of students in various schools have become increasingly difficult, so that they cannot study with peace of mind. The person in charge of the Overseas Chinese Department of Education had previously issued a statement, listing the facts to refute it. Regarding the relief of students' lives in Fujian Province, according to Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Department of Education, the government bears all the tuition and food expenses for 7,000 students in ten provincial normal schools and more than 3,000 students in three specialized schools. Each person is given a monthly food allowance of eight yuan, and it is stipulated that they eat 1 jin and 3 liang of rice per day. The provincial government will still allocate funds to compensate for any losses based on the local food prices. In addition, since the outbreak of the war in the Min River, more than 2,500 students from the war zone have been unable to afford living expenses. The province will issue a subsidy of ten yuan per month to each person. Starting from the next semester, they will also be given the same treatment as students in normal and specialized schools. All these rumors are self-defeating. In addition, the Department of Education recently formulated measures for students in public and private secondary schools to stay at school during the summer vacation to work. During the summer vacation, the school should allow students in the occupied areas to stay at school and give them various training in the spirit of production and labor.</p>

It is not to say that being a mason is not worthy of being done, but if there is excellent scientific talent, allowing him to be limited by the environment to be a mason is a major loss to the world; it is like throwing away a film taken by a famous artist before it has been washed by a developing solution, which is such a pity. However, our unequal society is doing just that!</p>
<p>This too great shortcoming cannot be completely made up for in a moment, but the efforts of people in society are not a complete failure. The creation of the newspaper readers' scholarship fund is hoping to make up for a part of this shortcoming. With the donations of all readers, we hope to wash out a few beautiful films for society.</p>
<p>Every promising poor student is a film worth trying, and all readers supply the developing solution!</p>
<h3>Fireflies and Flies</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>One evening, in the green bushes, a late-returning fly met an early-rising firefly; the weather was so hot that they could take a cool break here, and it was too awkward to be silent, so everyone came to talk.</p>
<p>"Is this Brother Fly?" the firefly opened his mouth and said.</p>
<p>"That's right, may I ask who you are, brother?" the fly asked, opening all its compound eyes. The firefly didn't answer, but shook its tail, emitting a circle of jade-colored light, as if to say, "Which insect has light on its body?" Although the fly's knowledge was limited, it also knew what the other party was called, so it continued, "Oh, so it's Brother Firefly, I've been admiring you for a long time! Our names have similar pronunciations, we must have been a family hundreds of years ago?" Flies are the most talkative, but what is the purpose of the last sentence?</p>
<p>"Although the pronunciation is similar," the firefly said seriously, "I have nothing to do with you; just take the issue of cleanliness, how far is the distance between you and me!"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, habit becomes nature, I don't think dirt is dirt. —Eh, Brother Firefly, the weather today..." The fly obviously wanted to open up the topic, but the firefly wanted to pull it back, and said:</p>
<p>"Habit becomes nature, but being close to dirt is a bad habit after all; look, your feet are full of garbage, your mouth is covered with greasy food, your wings emit a stench, what do you look like?"</p>
<p>"This is a matter of life," the fly said unconvincedly, "Life comes first, what does cleanliness or dirtiness matter? To be honest, you are so sallow and thin because you seek cleanliness. Look at me, with oily hair, fat ears, and a big belly, how glorious! And the reason is that I don't mind being dirty." The fly strode up, looking very proud.</p>
<p>"Those who collude with dirt are all dregs!" the firefly said loudly.</p>
<p>The fly turned its head and said, "What? I'm a dreg? What are you?"</p>
<p>"I am the creator of light; my responsibility is to fight against darkness. Stars are bright lights in the sky, and I am bright lights on the ground."</p>
<p>"Oh haha"! The fly laughed and said, "What empty words! In the world, dirt and darkness prevail, and following the trend is the hero."</p>
<p>"Hum! It turns out that you have the face of a slave!"</p>
<p>"Brother shouldn't speak hurting people, what does brother mean——"</p>
<p>"I'm telling you to go"! the firefly said angrily. The fly saw that something was wrong, so it swelled its belly and flew away, buzzing, thinking of flying to a place with a pile of dog droppings.</p>
<p>The firefly glowed again, and the darkness was shattered by it.</p>

<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Gengma</p>
<p>Eleven: Midnight Song</p>
<p>Now, Autumn Begonia's life is finally out of danger.</p>
<p>"Alas! My illness has truly made you suffer!" Every time his daughter brought him cooked thin porridge or a tonic soup, he would sigh repeatedly. "Not only have your studies at school been neglected, but your arms have also become as thin as crow's legs! Alas! I never thought I would contract this epidemic!"</p>
<p>"How can a person never get sick?" Mei Bao always forced a smile, trying her best to comfort him. "Schoolwork doesn't matter much. At most, you'll graduate a year later, which isn't a big deal. Dad, just rest well! I only hope you can get out of bed and feel better soon."</p>
<p>"That's what I think too! But these damned bones of mine feel like they've been soaked in a mortar for half a month, and they just won't get strong again," Autumn Begonia said, hitting the edge of the bed with his hand, feeling sorry for himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, although his fever had subsided, Mei Bao's daily work of preparing medicine could not be stopped yet. The doctor said he still had to drink at least a dozen or twenty more doses!</p>
<p>During Autumn Begonia's illness, Mei Bao made another friend, who was the daughter-in-law of the Meng shopkeeper who ran the general store across the street. Actually, they had known each other for a long time, but before, when they met, they would just nod and smile, which was not enough to be considered friends. It wasn't until Autumn Begonia got sick and Mei Bao went to their store every day to buy things or ask them to bring some medicine that the Meng family's young mistress started talking to her. This woman was probably at least seven or eight years older than Mei Bao, but she was very enthusiastic. Even if you didn't go to her, she would often come to help you. In the days when Autumn Begonia's illness was at its worst, Mei Bao and Xiao Gouzi really received a lot of help from her, so Mei Bao's friendship with her became very close in a natural way.</p>
<p>"Sister, how is your father today? What did he eat this afternoon?" The Meng shopkeeper's daughter-in-law walked into the kitchen lightly and put a hand on Mei Bao's shoulder, asking. (160)</p>
<p>Inventions</p>
<h3>Eye Protection Mask</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Foreigners pay special attention to fitness, especially light baths. They are simple and easy to perform, but they are still not common in our country. In order to protect the eyes of those who enjoy sunbathing in the United States from the stimulation and damage of the sun's rays, a kind of eye mask made of aluminum has recently been invented. It is light and convenient, and can be placed on the eyes, allowing the eyes to open and close freely. The outside is coated with a layer of aluminum paint, which can reflect sunlight and prevent the eye mask from becoming too hot. There are metal wires connecting the eye masks, like glasses.</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>Autopsy</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingwei</p>
<p>After medical students survive the first semester of skeletal courses, they have to hide in the dissection room all day to dissect corpses starting in the second year. This is generally recognized as stimulating enough. Not only are they not afraid of corpses, but they also treat them as treasures.</p>
<p>The dissection room is not big, there are only two large pits inside, specially used to store corpses, all soaked in medicinal solution. The smell of this medicinal solution will make friends who are not used to it shed tears and snot together.</p>
<p>The corpses are male and female, old and young, in various shapes and forms. Some are whole, some are half, and even a hand or a foot. As long as it is a part of the human body, it does not rot. Except for the smell of medicinal solution, you would not know it is a corpse at all.</p>
<p>If you were given a kidney, you would definitely take it and stir-fry it with some shrimp without being told it was a human kidney. When you see a brain, big and heavy, it takes two hands to lift it after it has been solidified in medicinal solution. Don't think it is a cow's brain, in fact everyone is the same.</p>
<p>Everyone says that fat people have too much fat. Wrong, completely wrong, they are all lean, even leaner than beef. The meat of a fresh corpse is even better than the best beef.</p>
<p>"The bellies of short people have more lumps." This saying is unreliable. Roundworms are often found after cutting open the intestines.</p>
<p>Human lungs are the most unsanitary, gray-black in color, looking like they were dug out of a gutter. This is because of the inhalation of coal ash. Although pigs often drill around in mud, their lungs are very clean, bright red, white, fat, and tender.</p>
<p>Everything that is damaged must be found out; how the person died must be investigated thoroughly. Surgeons have great skills in surgery because they have worked hard in anatomy. Even internal medicine doctors can tell whether the lungs are healthy or not by using a stethoscope on a living person's chest and tapping with their fingers. They also have to study corpses first. The sound is different after the lungs rot. You will understand after cutting open a corpse and looking at it. Typhoid fever is caused by ulcers in the intestines, which can be seen after cutting open the intestines, and it is by no means nonsense. What cannot be seen with the naked eye can be examined under a microscope to see clearly.</p>
<h3>Severely Punish Bribery</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>According to the annual report of the Central National Anti-Bribery Investigation Association for 1940, a total of 43 bribery cases were uncovered in the year.</p>
<p>One of them was related to the construction of air-raid shelters. A civil prosecutor and an inspector who accepted bribes were sentenced to one year and three months in prison; several other accomplices were sentenced to terms ranging from nine months to one year. In addition, there was a case where a chairman bribed a patrolman with five pounds to accuse a young man who had mistakenly entered his house of theft. The chairman was also convicted.</p>
<p>I think this kind of bribery investigation agency should be enthusiastically supported and cooperated with by everyone. Especially during wartime, many civilians often suffer because of one person's bribery. Whether from a moral or professional point of view, this should be punished most severely!</p>

<h3>A Sketch of Child Star Baby Sandy</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>— About to Seize Shirley Temple's Position —</p>
<p>Baby Sandy is the daughter of a ranch owner, living in an atmosphere of milk every day. She has now entered the age of four from the age of three. She will establish a position as a child star in Hollywood, and the future is unlimited. She first performed in a singing film starring Pingk Crosby. Although only two years have passed, now when we look at her on the screen, she is different from two years ago. She has grown up a lot and is a typical little girl.</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, Universal was filming a singing film starring singing star Pingk Crosby and was looking for a child star. As a result, Baby Sandy was selected. At that time, when we looked at her on the screen, we could not clearly tell whether she was a boy or a girl. But now, her pair of bright blue eyes and a head of golden curly hair fully show that she is a little girl.</p>
<p>Sandy's father, Louis Henry, is a ranch owner in Los Angeles. Sandy's mother read an advertisement in the newspaper from a film company looking for a baby and suggested to her husband that he send some photos of Sandy to apply. These photos were all taken on the ranch with dairy cows and milk as the background.</p>
<p>Charles Pulivan, the music director of Universal, gave Sandy's photos to photographer David Burton Lai, because David was responsible for selecting the child actor. As a result, she was selected. Now she weighs thirty pounds and is three feet six inches tall. Among the toys, she likes dolls the most, and also has a rubber ball. She also regards a carriage as a beloved object. Her best friend is a boy next door named Bob, who has toy trucks and toy cars. The two of them often move all the toys together to play.</p>
<p>Sandy can read the dialogues in the film fluently. The two sentences she says best are "Ah! Yes." and "Let's do that, okay?" She has only filmed three films, namely Sandy is a Lady and Sand Gets Her Man, and the other is the singing film starring Pingk Crosby.</p>
<p>Like many other big stars, when filming, if there is a scene with her, she will be dazzled by the colorful scenery. However, unlike adults, everything is very innocent and straightforward. "Me, where do I stand?" She often asks this when filming. Undoubtedly, in the next few years, she will seize Shirley Temple's position in Hollywood. She is a child star that cannot be underestimated!</p>
<p>Brief Portraits of Film Personalities</p>
<h3>(Fifteen) James Stewart</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>He won the Best Actor Academy Award this year for his performance in "The Philadelphia Story". However, according to general opinion, his "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" seems to be comparatively better. The roles he plays always have some affectation, which is similar to his wooden personality. He was born on May 20, 1908. When he graduated from school, he went to New York to look for a job, but was not successful. He and his classmate Henry Fonda experienced the most embarrassing and desolate encounters of their lives when they were on Broadway. It was not until 1933 that they gradually turned their luck around. Now, he is actually one of the four biggest stars. He and Olivia Harverland are in love and seem to have a high chance of getting married.</p>
<h3>Rewatching "The Big Road"</h3>
<p>— Si Ren</p>
<p>Leaving Behind Lovely Old Traces</p>
<p>The re-release of domestic blockbusters initiated by publishers Bian Yuying and others, starting with "The Big Road," began at the Shanghai Cinema the night before last. By 8:20 p.m., it was sold out, which the theater authorities considered a miracle. It is said that new films do not have this kind of momentum. I also went to the theater that night to rewatch it. I was more excited and happy than watching a new film. I remember that at the memorial service for my deceased friend Shen Xiling, many of Xiling's posthumous works were displayed, such as photos of "Crossroads" and "Song of the Fishermen." Director Fei Mu said after seeing those photos, "Normally, when we look at photos of films, we can't wait three or five years. Once they are out of date, we won't like them. But Xiling's posthumous works are still worth rewatching today!" I have the same feeling when I watch "The Big Road." I feel that Shi Dongshan's directing skills are not only not outdated, but cannot be seen in most new films today. And the refined and moving performances of Jin Shan, Hu Ping, Gu Er Yi, Wang Wei Yi, and others, along with their tireless efforts, make people feel that "each generation is not as good as the previous one." Especially when I saw Zhou Xuan on the screen, she was so innocent and so charming. It was truly her golden age, but now Zhou Xuan is a different person. Films leave behind lovely old traces for people, but aren't they also cruel imprints?</p>
<p>It's not to say that there are no works like "The Big Road" now, but there are too few, too few.</p>
<h3>Dancer Wu Xiaobang Gets Married</h3>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: All Are Ningwu Can Do Nothing</p>
<p>Xu Jing spoke, sighing endlessly. Liu Yining also deeply regretted that he was late and could not contribute sooner. This was a great disappointment. He sighed, "There is no need to say these words. I also have regrets. Let's rest for the night and go to Ningwu early tomorrow morning to spy on the situation, adapt to the circumstances, and then make plans. I will fight with the bandits no matter what." Although Xu Jing was anxious in his heart, he had no idea for a while, so he had to listen to Liu Yining's words, sighing frequently, and went back to sleep. Liu Yining went to order the old monk to bring a piece of wooden board, put the chairs on it, and used it as a temporary bed. He took off his clothes and went to sleep. Having something on his mind, he naturally couldn't sleep. He heard Xu Jing tossing and turning on the pit, sighing, and guessed that it was because of Ningwu Pass that he couldn't sleep. By the second half of the night, the red color on the window had faded a lot, probably the fire had been extinguished. In an instant, the east was white. Liu Yining was the first to jump up. He saw Xu Jing opening his eyes wide and peeking at himself. He put on his clothes and smiled at Xu Jing, "Brother Jing, didn't you sleep well? Why are you staring at me?" Xu Jing also sat up and said, "A big fire broke out at Ningwu Pass, and it has probably been lost. How can I sleep soundly? I see that you haven't fallen asleep either." Liu Yining nodded and asked, "How does the injury on your arm feel?" Xu Jing replied, "Fortunately, it didn't hurt my bones. I just feel a slight pain and can't move it. But I can't care about that. Let's hurry to Ningwu Pass." Liu Yining said yes, and the two of them put on their clothes and got up. Liu Yining went out to get two basins of cold water from the old monk. The two of them washed themselves and tidied their hair, putting on their hats. The old monk brought a large bowl of steaming porridge. The two of them smelled the fragrance of the porridge. Although there was nothing special, just a basin of salted radish, for the sake of filling their stomachs, they both ate three bowls, finishing the entire bowl of porridge. Liu Yining then called the old monk over and took out three or four taels of broken silver to give him. He said, "Thank you for disturbing you yesterday. We bid you farewell now." The old monk bowed and thanked them, saying, "May you have a bright future." (117)</p>
