<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>蘇聯與基督敎（二）</h3>
<p>那一晚的重要時刻到來了，史太林起立，向廳中所懸的羅斯福總統像舉起杯子，用俄語說道：「願上帝幫助他的工作。」</p>
<p>前任蘇聯駐美大使烏曼斯基，把史太林所說譯成英文，有幾位英美貴賓，面上露着驚異之色，詢問鄰座的俄人，烏曼斯基所譯是否正確，他們都回說譯的確是不錯。</p>
<p>史太林爲什麽呼籲上帝之名呢？這位蘇聯領袖曾受過正敎牧師的敎育，亦常引用聖經或宗敎的詞句，且較列寗爲多。但是各代表都承認像史太林這樣一位的政治家，決不會信口而出此言。</p>
<p>美國的宗敎機關和孤立派，皆以蘇聯迫害宗敎爲理由，而反對俄國，羅斯福總統即因說過蘇聯憲法保障宗敎自由，而遭受他們的攻擊。</p>
<p>因此史太林的祝飮，其自的是在美國，但並不在美國公衆。蘇聯官吏並不欲以此通知美國新聞記者，實則在此時間，他們確不願一班新聞記者對於宗敎問題有何記載。</p>
<p>史太林的目的似乎直接在羅斯福總統。他知道美國代表將把他的祝詞告訴總統。他知道羅斯福總統常到敎堂，且常在演說中涉及宗敎。他又知道羅斯福總統對於宗敎機關的攻擊蘇俄曾代爲辯護，以致受人非議。</p>
<p>因此史太林似乎正要華盛頓方面的友人，知道克萊姆林宮中對於上帝或是宗敎，實際並無成見，使羅總統能繼續爲蘇聯辯護而於心無愧。至少這是幾位代表所能得到的解釋。</p>
<p>史太林鬢髮漸斑—有的代表說牠已在轉白了。他們見他祇有五呎六七吋高，不免覺得奇怪。</p>
<p>史太林雖年已六十三歲，而老當益壯，精神矍爍，每天辦事時間很長。他平常於上午六時起見客。蘇聯報紙中時常記載着一個發明家，科學家，或工廠經理，因工作完善而於夜半後赴克萊姆林宮接受史氏的祝賀。他似乎常常澈夜坐在寫字檯前辦公。</p>
<p>史太林的記憶力很强，能和專家們討論關於技術上的事項。雷浦金，皮佛勃羅克和哈理門，發見他能詳論最新式的大砲，戰車，和飛機的專門細節。</p>
<p>史太林並不是一個村夫。他雖日理萬幾，仍有時間讀書，這位蘇聯領袖，對於英德法三國的現代文學，能歷歷如數家珍，他數年前曾和費區王傑Leon　Feuchtwauges　作一小時的談話，於現代文學趨勢瞭如指掌，使費氏爲之驚歎不已。</p>
<p>戰爭時代，雙方宣傳，莫不侈言道德，誇張神權，這是一定之理。所以在上次，世界大戰中，英國方面發出「上帝保佑我王」的呼聲，德國便報以「上帝降罰英國」和「上帝保佑我人」的呼籲。</p>
<p>俄羅斯雖久已處於實際主義制度之下，牠的領袖也公然以無神論自詡，而對所謂「阻塞智力發展之路的敎會」避之若凂，和她今日宣傳中的祈天保佑，適成一尖銳的對照。莫斯科對於這種態度的改變並不滿意，這可於一九三八年史太林憲法的第一百二十四條中看出—政治與宗敎分立學校與宗敎分立，承認信仰宗敎的自由，和人民反宗敎宣傳的自由。（未完）</p>

<p>銀錢業聯合辦事處、雖昨日爲例假日、仍照常辦公、尤以辦理各行莊押款貨物品名數量之申報、更爲繁忙、緣是項登記、將於今日截止、故於敦促及徵集申報單之所需時間、甚不充分也、</p>

<p>兜售國米</p>
<p>鄰近上海四郊產米之區、連日以布袋盛一斗至數斗之國米、運入租界中區兜售者、亦不乏其人、數量慚多、當茲米店購糴擁擠之時、於民食調節、不無裨益、</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>婦女修養</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>有一個葛立菲斯博士，在某一本雜誌裹面，說：「世界上唯有一種職業和生意經，在從業之前，一點也不需要準備，那就是結婚。」我以爲這實在是一種錯誤，因爲在組微家庭之後，有許多家事，都不是一天可以學會的，而對於性的智識，兒童扶育等的學識，都須有長時間的研究，如果不在結婚以前，先事準備就不能有良好的結果。</p>
<p>女小說家芬妮赫斯德（她曾著有「芳華虛度」等書的話，就說得得體了，她說：『如果你敎育一個男子，你只是敎育了一個人。如果你敎育一個女子，你就敎育了一個家庭』可見婦女修養的重要，因爲她的一舉一動，對於家庭的每一個分子，都有密切的關係，自然間接對於社會具有很大的影響。</p>
<p>我們曾接到許多讀者的來信，說他們的妻子不顧他們進款的微少，只知道崇尚奢華，而目還要爲着收入不豐而抱怨。這種情形發生的原因，是這些做妻子的缺少修養。在目前收支很難相抵的時候，每一對夫婦，要學學音樂家馬扎德的精神。馬扎德夫婦在一個冷天，沒有錢去買煤生火，兩個人在屋子裹跳着舞去使體溫增高）。</p>
<p>易卜生並不是一個婦女從政的提倡家，但是他相信婚姻的基礎，必須樹立在忠誠，自由和智慧的伴侶上的，要造成他所制定的這個基礎，充分的修養，實在是一個先決條件。</p>
<p>我的家庭問題　徵文揭曉之十一</p>
<h3>一個叫孩子打駡的父親</h3>
<p>— 秀</p>
<p>我們的雙親年紀已經都在五十左右了，除了生下我們姊妹五個外，在六年前總算還了父母的夙願。</p>
<p>這確是可喜的，連續有了五個女兒後，居然會天賜麟兒。而且還是老來得的呢。何怪父親一直愁眉蹙額的面孔，以後總是笑逐顏開，做起事來也起勁得多了。父親是始終主張女兒總是外面人，將來潑出去的水，養兒子才有出息。母親呢，更是謝天謝地的說弟弟是救命王菩薩，他救了我們一家！原來父親可以不用納妾，而家產也有了承繼的人了。再說我們，都快樂非凡，因爲從此我們多了個異性的同胞了。然而，不幸就在這上面開始了！</p>
<p>父親是開小米店的，母親是個文盲，所以弟弟會講話後，父親就問：『孩子，你將來做什麼？』於是母親先說了，『寳實將來是做大老闆的，賺大洋鈿，住洋房，坐汽車，吃大菜。』不久以後，弟弟便會說話了。像『姊姊們是女人，要靠男人的，不會賺大洋錢養爸媽；寳寳是男人，可以做老闆做大官』。『老司務統滾開，我大老闆大少爺來了，快倒茶！鏘咚…鏘！你們都只配奉承老闆！』……於是在旁邊的爸媽便哈哈大笑了。夥計們也陪着湊趣。</p>
<p>陰霾愈發濃厚了，弟弟竟更慢慢地學會了打人，駡人等惡劣的言行。事情是這樣的：不知在那一天，父親說：『寳寳你會打爸爸嗎？你打打看，舉起小拳頭來……』弟弟便照樣的做了！『哈哈，寳寳打人了，寳寳，你再去踢一脚媽，去踢！踢了買糖炒栗子你吃，去！』弟弟又乖靈的跑過去：背後父親更說：『舉起小脚來，重些！啊好呀！』媽被弟弟踢了後，就味咪笑抱起弟弟，親了一個嘴，然後說：『寳寳，駡爹爹，駡他老猪玀老東西』</p>
<p>『爹爹老東西，老猪玀。』繼而『姊姊是女人』等話老掛在弟弟的嘴上，他簡直天天拿它做山歌唱，唉！弟弟。</p>
<p>更想不到的，我們的求學也受了弟弟的影響　！父母已肯定的告訴我們，說如有初中畢業的女兒，她不能再　下去。</p>
<p>我們爲了救弟弟，使雙親趕快覺悟，都屢次的勸諫過，但我們屢次的受到一頓臭駡，理由是『老來子』得來不是容易的事，須要上代有積德，祠堂坐風水，子孫行善事才會有。他一定是善才童子下凡，有根器的，你們現在看看都像有良心，將來靠了男人早把我們忘了唉！這使我們有何辦法呢？</p>
<p>編者按</p>
<p>中國的家庭，眞是五花八門，無奇不有，這五個姊妹的痛告，是很容易想象的。然而處於這個環境之下，唯有一方面忍耐着，一方面想方法給父母一點暗示，因爲要收實際的功效，決不是用決裂的方法，可以產生完美的結果的，祇有沉着應付（但並不是妥協），同時對於學問的求取，決不可以放鬆，最好硏究一二種實用學術，可以謀經濟的獨立，有五個姊妹志同道合地在一起，實在是一件很可喜的事。</p>
<p>至於那年幼無知的弟弟，當他離開父母而投入學校的懷抱以後，會逐漸去除他的錯誤的觀念的。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜单</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這幾天一切物價，又在漲起來了。我們的開門七件事，當然不會例外。但是有一樣東西却是例外的，鮮帶魚很爲便宜，較小的每兩五六分，較大的也只須七八分，大約因爲來貨很多，充斥市上之故。鮮帶魚在魚類中，給與人們的印象很不壞，爲它魚刺不多，並且容易去掉，連孩子們也可放心地吃。做法共有幾種：一種是淸蒸，肉頭較嫩，但須加些葱薑和猪油丁在內，醬油可出良妻脾濃的一種，味兒很鮮。一種是紅燒，不須輔佐品，愛甜酸的可和以糖醋，不用糖醋的，如有酒釀，那麽可以鋪在上面，一同紅燒，其味倒也不惡。</p>

<p>製法：將鮮肉刴爛，和以醬油精或蝦子醬油，及適量之糖，料酒，菱粉，味精，鹽等用箸拌和，乃將洗淨之蟹，用小刀將蟹之腹部揭開，把拌和之肉塞於蟹腹內，然後裝入碗中，並加葱結薑片，隔水蒸熟即成。</p>
<p>（一五一）白菜炒蟹粉　（姚克昌擬稿）</p>

<h3>難爲無米之炊</h3>
<p>— 寥然</p>
<p>祇要是個有情感的人，一跑到十字街頭，看看羣衆糴米買煤球的緊張危急的情形，心中就會莫明地引起一種悲慘之感來；這種悲慘之感，與其是出之於憐憫，母寗是十足的「自哀」。現在不論爲富爲窮，沒有一個敢處之泰然。「雖有臺池烏獸，豈能獨樂哉？」</p>
<p>「老弱轉乎溝壑」，這還不合時令，壯者亦已惴惴惟恐不絕如縷。一般市民，要生存得有維持生命的錢：錢不易弄到的祇有死，於是先縊死小的，再絞死老的，然後自己尋死。這樣就默默地死去一大羣。萬一天無絕人之路，偶而弄到了錢，於是得糴米生火煮粥，但看看一羣老小，再看看自己，耍在六七百個人的行列裏，求生存條件，正是痛哭流涕頓足長太息。這裹有個平常而眞實的故事：某行一個某職員，早晨去辦公，中午安步當車回家進午養，鍋中依然粒米毫無，一氣之下，責問他底老婆。老婆呢，「　彼小星，三五在東，肅肅宵征，夙夜在公」，上午四點鐘，拋離了飢啼的嬰兒，就去排班買米，手無縛鷄之力的弱女子，在擁擠的飢餓之羣中，那裏能勝任愉快，脚被踏傷不算，錢也幾乎失落掉。中午回家，兩手空空，仍是難爲無米之炊。內心的傷感可知，還要受丈夫的奚落，憤怒怨恨更燃燒起來，不一會偷偷地在後房弔死了結。丈夫發現了，似乎沒有什麼辦法，也尋死完結。</p>
<p>其他自殺之羣的死法更多，但都是求生不得的人們。</p>
<p>在這個年頭，念念書生餓死尋常事」之佳句，雖是自謙之辭，但能偷空地念，現在終不至於就死；我想有一分力的人，還可以爲一般眞止的小民想想辦法！</p>
<p>當局月來爲民生問題確已盡了最大的努力，這是人所共見的。現在大衆確也到了最苦痛之時。天下之至仁者雖焦頭爛額，亦所不惜爲民着想。「民非水火不生活，昏暮叩人之門戶，求水火，無弗與者。」使有菽粟如水火，則在於工部局當局更大的努力。</p>
<h3>上海無夜景</h3>
<p>— 葉仁</p>
<p>霓虹燈發明之後，都市的夜景是點綴得史燦爛美麗了。有人在迷霧之夜，登高遠矚，歎爲天下之奇觀。自己雖然沒有霧夜賞燈的經騐，但是看過玻璃缸中遊泳着的金魚，猜想透過水蒸汽的霓虹燈光確有賞心悅目的奇蹟的。所以，與「生意眼」並無多大關係的××估衣莊也曾在大世界樓上裝過紅藍兩色的霓虹燈，而了確是觀者雲集。</p>
<p>現在，電車已在九時進廠，居戶用電减爲百分之八十，霓虹燈自然也不再是都市之夜的驕子了。那位先生如果再有那種豪興，登高一望，即使是明月當空之夜，也要頽然歡曰：「上海無夜景！」</p>
<p>其實，過去的上海之夜果然是燦爛，美麗，但是幾多的精神與金錢，浪費在燈光之下？幾多的罪惡，發生在夜市塲中？所以現在的「提早打烊」雖是當局節省電力的緊急處置，浸淫在夜生活中的上海人却實在獲得了一個革除惡習慣的良好機會，同時早起早眠，也大俾益於健康。不過，不要以爲家里的電炬還可以應付，就湊滿四人團團坐，白板中風到通霄，罰款五元還是小事（法租界定章　夜十二時後，脾聲達於戶外者罰洋五元），超過電度而剪綫，那才眞要嘗一嘗黑暗生活了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦廋鷗</p>
<p>十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>於是經過了這家小客棧的老板娘的拉攏，梅寳便和樓下十七號裏那個姓韓的姑娘上緊親熱起來；第二天，叉把那位韓老先生拉上樓去，跟秋海棠一起吃了一餐飯，大家便在同病相憐的情况下，議定了合作的辦法。梅寳和那位韓家姑娘的唱工雖也差得很速，但讓外行聽了，還不容易就辨別出來；倒是那姓韓的山東人的一支胡琴拉得太糟了，四個人一經試演之下，便決定在出去賣唱的時候，完全讓秋海棠操琴，姓韓的祇用一把二胡陪襯陪襯。</p>
<p>但秋海棠也並不吃虧，因爲那姓韓的同鄉很多，在街上混混的馬路英雄認識得也不少，這一點對於他們的營業，當然大有幫助：所以合作開始以後，一切都很順利，僅僅有一件事永遠使秋海棠覺得非常不快，那就是聽客們對梅寳的態度。</p>
<p>「想不到咱們曾弄到這般地步，！」他時常這般唉聲嘆氣的說』（二八四）</p>
<h3>我買到了米！　祗有一升</h3>
<p>— 靑水</p>
<p>早晨，從爹手裏遞過來二元六角，從娘手裹拿了只「洋麵口袋」去趕市買米，起初我有點忸怩，終於挺了腰大踏步地向羣衆長隊走去。</p>
<p>時光很早，街上舖門都沒有起下，××號米店「鐵欄」緊拉着，還有着一道板門作後衛，一點也看不見裹面動靜，可是門前却閙翻了，人頭鑽動，你擁我推的站下了一字長蛇陣。</p>
<p>時間一分一分的過去，人却一個一個的加多起來，快十點鐘哪，怎麼還不開門？早寒是那樣的刺骨，使貼胸靠背的人們越是台得緊些，可是大伙兒却沒有吃早飯呀，賣大餅的小三子投機似地在人巷裏忙碌，大家對他嚥口水！我脚有點酸慄，沒有法子呀，好容易米店板門才起去了一半，「161」號，白粉字寫上了我的右臂袖管，陣脚在移動了，大家又是一陣蠕動叫喊！</p>
<p>身旁電綫桿的影子，由斜長而快縮成沒有了，才挨到我的頭上，一隻手送進去鈔票，隨着一隻手便將洋麵口袋遞入了二尺見方的鐵洞口—生命的泉源—眼見了米，忘記了脚痛</p>
<p>「調一張一塊頭！」突如其來的霹靂，可把我震住了。難道是假的不成？</p>
<p>「怎樣？」賠着小心，輕輕的問。</p>
<p>「眼睛不生！你自家看看這樣爛的票子！」如虎的吼聲，鈔票已被擲在米袋上。一面便去接收在我後面的人鈔票去</p>
<p>我心火怒燒，幾乎要噴出來，但是，一想起媽這時候一定看着空鍋子在焦急的情况，不得不按下性子。</p>
<p>「就買一升吧！」低聲！</p>
<p>洋麵口袋只裝飽了兩隻角的米，沒精打彩的被我提了回去，我眞想哭，足足地站了四小時，擠，打，駡，酸，痛，餓，爲了「一升米折腰」呀！</p>

<h3>American Strategic Authority General King Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet; Two Ocean Coasts Divided into Thirteen Defense Zones</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 20th: President Roosevelt today appointed Admiral Ernest King, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy. All Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets will be under his supreme command. He will also be responsible for the defense of the coast and frontiers, reporting only to President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox. The position of Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, which he vacates, will be succeeded by Rear-Admiral Royal Ingersoll.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 21st: Political observers here have stated that Admiral King is an aviation expert. His appointment to this important position is crucial for the future development of American strategy. Admiral King, who is sixty-seven years old, is known as the "Eagle" in the U.S. Navy. He participated in the Spanish-American War and the last World War, serving as commander of submarines and the Navy's air force.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 21st: General King has now been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet. King was originally the Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. When British Prime Minister Churchill and U.S. President Roosevelt held the Atlantic Conference on the recently sunk British battleship "Prince of Wales," King also participated in his capacity as Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st: The U.S. Navy Department announced that "defense sea areas" have been established near thirteen important harbors and waterways on the east and west coasts of the United States. Navigation within these areas will be under the supervision of the Navy. Maritime authorities have warned ships to navigate within these areas only during daylight hours. The designated areas include Portland in Maine, Portsmouth in New Hampshire, Boston in Massachusetts, Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, San Diego and San Francisco in California, and the mouth of the Columbia River in Washington State. The coast of the Jantzen Beach area, the port of Puget Sound, New York Harbor, New London, and Delaware Bay are also included.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, San Francisco, 21st: The commander of the local naval forces, Admiral Greenslade, recently stated that several Japanese submarines are quite active along the coast of California. Local naval authorities also announced, based on unconfirmed reports, that two U.S. oil tankers were attacked by Japanese submarines off the coast of California. One of them has sent out a distress signal.</p>
<h3>Britain to Establish Operational Committee in the Far East; Pledges Utmost Effort to Defend Malaya and Australia; Sino-British Military Cooperation Running Smoothly</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 20th: The British government will establish a Far East Operational Committee, chaired by Duff Cooper, the British representative in the Far East. Its organization may include two commanders-in-chief, the Governor, representatives from the Australian government, and Sir Sansom, former commercial counselor at the British Embassy in Japan. Sir Sansom was recently transferred to the Economic Warfare Department to direct propaganda work in Malaya from Singapore.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Singapore, 20th: Officials have announced that the "Far East Military Conference" is scheduled to be held here today and tomorrow. It will be chaired by Duff Cooper, British Cabinet Minister stationed in Singapore. In addition to the British Far East land and sea commanders, attendees will include the Governor of the Straits Settlements, representatives from the Australian Commonwealth government, and Sir Sansom. Sir Sansom previously served as a commercial counselor at the British Embassy in Japan for many years until he was recently transferred to the Economic Warfare Department, responsible for handling commercial issues between Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 20th: Reuters issued an official statement stating, "The situation in Malaya remains extremely serious. Japanese forces have occupied the area northwest of Malaya, near Penang Island, making the defense of the island impossible. The fall of the island is strategically important and will greatly benefit the Japanese, who can now block the Strait of Malacca, or at least control maritime traffic in the strait, and use Penang as a base to disrupt British commercial shipping in the Indian Ocean. Singapore, Rangoon, Sumatra, and the Burmese coast will also be threatened. Furthermore, if the rubber plantations in Malaya are not destroyed in advance, they will be occupied by the Japanese, seriously impacting Britain's rubber supply. It is undeniable that the threat to the port of Singapore is increasing daily, but we are determined to resist to the end at any cost. To defend Singapore, we must establish a strong air force. We must understand that the importance of the Pacific War is no different from the beginning of the German-Soviet War. Thanks to the efforts of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, a naval base has been established in Rangoon, and British troops are being sent there in a steady stream before being deployed to the Thai border. At the same time, Chinese troops will also fight alongside us near Burma and Guangzhou-Kowloon. Since the British Cabinet appointed Duff Cooper as its representative to the Far East, the British War Cabinet is now considering setting up a small war cabinet in Singapore. This organization will be responsible for administering the local area and commanding British forces in the Pacific Theater, a development that has long been desired. If it is established, the Australian Commonwealth will also send representatives to participate, as Australia's safety is closely linked to the fate of Singapore."</p>
<h3>British Troops in Burma Reinforce Malaya; British Counterattack in Perak Province Reported to Make Progress</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 21st: A British convoy carrying troops and military supplies arrived in Malaya on the 19th. Mechanized troops were immediately dispatched to the northwest to prevent the Japanese from advancing southward.

<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:50 PM last night that Japanese forces operating in Malaya occupied Penang Island on the night of the 19th. Japanese forces in the Malay Peninsula are continuing to advance southward.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Singapore, 21st</p>

Britain has sent Admiral Leatham, Lieutenant General Wims, and Air Marshal Drummond to represent Britain in Washington.</p>
<h3>Philippine War Reaches Decisive Stage; Situation in Davao Port Unclear; Cavite Naval Base Attacked by Air</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 20th: According to reports from the Far East received by military circles, the major battle in the Philippines is underway. The first step of the Japanese offensive is to attack Mindanao Island, followed by a full-scale invasion of the Philippines. The latest war report released by the War Department did not provide details on the Japanese offensive routes, but it mentioned in a telegram from General MacArthur, the new commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines, regarding the Japanese landing in Davao Port. Japanese immigrants originally held a prominent position in the port, owning about half of all arable land. In addition, Japanese aircraft bombed Cavite Naval Base and Luzon Island, indicating that the war in the Philippines has entered a decisive stage.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Manila, 21st: The U.S. Far East Command Headquarters issued a communiqué stating, "Due to difficult transportation to and from Davao Port, the current situation in the port cannot be accurately reported." Japanese forces forcibly landed yesterday under heavy aerial bombardment.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Manila, 21st: Officials announced that Japanese aircraft bombed the area again today. They first dropped several bombs on Nichols Field and then flew across the bay to bomb Cavite Naval Base. The scale of this air raid was small, and the air raid alert issued here was brief. After the Japanese aircraft left, a small fire broke out in the Cavite area. The Japanese aircraft flew at a very high altitude and were barely visible from the ground. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Davao Port area, and no confirmed reports on the battle situation have been received. There are still scouting activities on Luzon Island.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Flies to Rangoon</h3>

<h3>Powers of Governor-General of Vietnam Expanded; French Territories in the Pacific Under His Direct Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 21st: Officials announced that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, will also serve as High Commissioner of French territories in the Pacific, with overall jurisdiction over Vietnam, New Caledonia and its dependencies, Oceania, and the New Hebrides. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, there has been a risk that French territories in the Far East will be affected. In light of this, the French government has established the post of High Commissioner in order to take various security measures to prepare for any eventuality. The recent landing of Australian-Dutch forces in Portuguese Timor further underscores the increasing difficulties faced by neutral territories.</p>

<h3>British Forces Defend Dangerously; Fierce Fighting in Hong Kong; Japanese Claim Control of Surrounding Waters; Fire in Victoria Street</h3>
<p>Kowloon, 21st: Some of the British defenders of Hong Kong retreated to Stanley and Ap Lei Chau, while others retreated to various fortresses such as Mount Nicholson, Gough Hill, Mount Kellett, and High West, and defended them at risk. Japanese forces are now heavily bombarding the above fortresses with artillery. The fighting is extremely fierce. Hong Kong Governor Young urgently telegraphed the British government for assistance and received a reply ordering him to hold Hong Kong and resist to the end.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: According to the latest news, after Japanese artillery prevented the British forces in the eastern and western parts of Hong Kong from returning fire, the Japanese forces are now busy resolving various independent resistance centers.

<h3>The Soviet Union and Christianity (II)</h3>
<p>That important moment of the evening arrived, Stalin stood up, raised his glass to the portrait of President Roosevelt hanging in the hall, and said in Russian: "May God help his work."</p>
<p>Umansky, the former Soviet ambassador to the United States, translated what Stalin said into English, and several British and American dignitaries showed surprised expressions on their faces, asking their Russian neighbors whether Umansky's translation was correct, and they all replied that the translation was indeed correct.</p>
<p>Why did Stalin invoke the name of God? The Soviet leader had been educated by an Orthodox priest, and often quoted biblical or religious phrases, even more so than Lenin. However, all the representatives admitted that a politician like Stalin would never say such a thing without thought.</p>
<p>American religious organizations and isolationists opposed Russia, citing the Soviet Union's persecution of religion as a reason. President Roosevelt was even attacked by them for saying that the Soviet Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.</p>
<p>Therefore, Stalin's toast was aimed at the United States, but not at the American public. Soviet officials did not want to notify American journalists of this, in fact, at this time, they certainly did not want a group of journalists to have any record of the religious issue.</p>
<p>Stalin's purpose seemed to be directly at President Roosevelt. He knew that the American representatives would tell the president about his toast. He knew that President Roosevelt often went to church and often involved religion in his speeches. He also knew that President Roosevelt had defended the Soviet Union against attacks from religious organizations, which caused him to be criticized.</p>
<p>Therefore, Stalin seemed to be letting his friends in Washington know that there was actually no prejudice against God or religion in the Kremlin, so that President Roosevelt could continue to defend the Soviet Union without feeling guilty. At least that's the explanation that several representatives were able to get.</p>
<p>Stalin's sideburns were gradually streaked with gray—some representatives said they were turning white. They couldn't help but find it strange that he was only five feet six or seven inches tall.</p>
<p>Although Stalin was already sixty-three years old, he was still strong and energetic, working long hours every day. He usually started seeing guests at six in the morning. Soviet newspapers often reported that an inventor, scientist, or factory manager went to the Kremlin after midnight to receive congratulations from Stalin for their perfect work. He seemed to often sit at his desk all night working.</p>
<p>Stalin had a strong memory and could discuss technical matters with experts. Rapplekin, Beaverbrook, and Harriman found that he could discuss the latest types of artillery, tanks, and aircraft in detail.</p>
<p>Stalin wasn't a bumpkin. Even though he had a million things to do every day, he still had time to read. The Soviet leader could rattle off the modern literature of England, Germany, and France like a family heirloom. He once had an hour-long conversation with Leon Feuchtwanger several years ago, and he understood modern literary trends so well that Mr. Feuchtwanger was amazed.</p>
<p>In wartime, propaganda on both sides inevitably exaggerates morality and exaggerates the divine right, which is inevitable. Therefore, in the last World War, the British side issued the cry of "God Save the King," and Germany responded with the appeals of "God Punish England" and "God Save Our People."</p>
<p>Although Russia has long been under a pragmatic system, its leaders openly professed atheism, and avoided the so-called "church that blocks the path of intellectual development" like the plague, which is in sharp contrast to her propaganda of praying to heaven for protection today. Moscow is not satisfied with this change of attitude, which can be seen in Article 124 of the 1938 Stalin Constitution - separation of politics and religion, separation of schools and religion, recognition of freedom of religious belief, and freedom of anti-religious propaganda for the people.

<h3>Coal Plants and Charcoal Shops Are Not Allowed to Refuse to Sell Fuel; Violators Will Be Punished Under the Crime of Endangering Public Security; Transportation Permits Are Limited to Use North of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were rumors in the coal market that the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council had agreed on concrete measures regarding the supply of coal in the city, including: 1. All market transactions, whether for bituminous coal, anthracite, coal blocks, or dross, are limited to spot goods. 2. The prices of all transactions concluded in the market thereafter must not be deliberately exceeded. If the holder of the goods refuses to release them at the price, anyone can directly report to the coal management committee of the two municipal councils, so that they can be investigated and punished according to law, or have their business license revoked, or be punished as endangering public security, or be deported.</p>
<p>Fuel Stocks Must Be Released on Schedule</p>
<p>Stocks of coal must be released within the date specified by the two municipal councils and must not be violated. 3. Permits must be obtained for the transportation of any quality of coal. Any free transportation will be treated as smuggling and confiscated, or punished by other methods. 4. All coal and charcoal shops selling bituminous coal, anthracite, coal balls, charcoal, and other related fuels at the storefront must sell them at the prescribed prices. Anyone who has goods but refuses to sell them at the price will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. It is also learned that yesterday, various coal and charcoal shops continued to deliver goods to the relevant coal ball factories for sale at the storefronts immediately. The coal ball transportation permits issued by the two authorities are limited to retail stores north of the Suzhou Creek within the British and French Concessions, which can be sold by coal ball factories in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Registration of Silver, Money, and Pawned Goods Deadline</h3>
<p>Although the United Office of the Silver and Money Industry was closed yesterday for a regular holiday, it still worked as usual, especially in handling the registration of the names and quantities of pawned goods from various banks and shops, which was even busier. Because the deadline for this registration is today, the time required to urge and collect registration forms is very insufficient.</p>
<h3>Sales Reporting Required for Hardware and Iron Businesses</h3>
<p>All hardware and iron businesses, which had previously temporarily ceased operations, have uniformly resumed business from the day before yesterday. The industry has been greatly affected due to the current situation. In this port, most major construction projects have now been halted, and the demand for hardware and iron materials related to construction engineering has reached a near-dead end. Moreover, various large and small factories in this city have suspended or reduced operations due to the shortage of raw materials. The demand for hardware and iron materials related to machinery is temporarily deemed unnecessary. Therefore, although the market prices of goods in stock for these businesses are high, actual sales are practically non-existent. Stockpilers, facing tight credit, will inevitably lower prices to sell. In the future, commodity prices will also trend downward. After the resumption of business by these firms, they were further instructed to apply for registration of the types and quantities of their inventory for record-keeping. The procedure is the same as for the registration of other materials. It is heard that after registration, if goods are sold, reports must also be submitted promptly. Currently, all firms have already declared in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Measures to Increase National Food Reserves:  Efforts to Dredge Rice Transport, Chartering Neutral Ships to Transport Vietnamese Rice; Prices of Fish, Meat, and Vegetables Have Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Rice Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the committee is currently in consultation with the Japanese authorities to increase the national food reserves and quickly alleviate the panic over rice. The plan is to dredge the supply of Vietnamese rice within a short period, allowing rice merchants to purchase in large quantities and transport it to Shanghai for regulation. Sources responsible for the committee also stated that the committee will also be responsible for chartering neutral ships for rice transport, and special preferential treatment will be given to water transport costs and freight.</p>
<p>Wuhu Rice Agreed</p>
<p>It is learned that two million dan of Wuhu rice have been agreed upon, ready to provide food for the people along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Shanghai can also be allocated some, but the specific allocation number is unknown. The future selling price is planned to be a flat rate of 100 yuan in legal tender per dan. The proposal to restore free trade in rice and grain has also been mentioned. If a proper and practical approach can be followed, the authorities will study it to avoid the drawbacks of crowding when buying rice.</p>
<p>Rice Warehouses Continue to Open</p>
<p>The Taikoo warehouse number 14, facing the New Kai River, reopened yesterday after releasing rice the day before. The number 2 warehouse along the Bund was opened. Rice shops are moving the foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council to sell at the door. However, the foreign rice stored in the warehouse yesterday was not released in its entirety. The Maotai warehouse on Baike Road and the Xinyuan warehouse on Xiamen Road also opened as usual yesterday. The number of people sent by the rice shops to carry the rice with the Municipal Council's transport permits was numerous at the Taikoo number 2 warehouse. The total amount of rice released from the three warehouses yesterday is unknown as it has not been tallied, but the number is not small, sufficient to supply the door sales of the rice shops. It is also learned that the remaining stored foreign rice will be opened in all warehouses in order, so there should be no shortage in the supply of food for the people.</p>
<p>Peddling National Rice</p>
<p>In the areas near Shanghai's four suburbs, there are many people who transport one to several dou of national rice in bags to peddle in the concession area, and the quantity is gradually increasing, which is beneficial to the regulation of food for the people at a time when rice shops are crowded with purchases.</p>
<p>Fish and Meat Price Fixing</p>
<p>The prices of fish, meat, and vegetables are currently being jointly negotiated by the authorities of the two concessions and the Japanese authorities. All stores selling them will operate according to the announcement. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be severely punished without leniency. The calculated prices are: Fresh meat, 4 yuan per pound; Fresh fish, 2.4 yuan per pound; Cabbage, 0.25 yuan per pound; Vegetables, 0.1 yuan per pound.</p>
<h3>Timber Sales Stagnant, Prices Trend Downward; Construction Gradually Stalling</h3>
<p>Since the 8th of this month, the timber industry has also been greatly impacted by the current situation. The market in this industry was once closed for two days, and then it quickly returned to normal. It was learned yesterday that the market prices of various foreign timber goods have slightly decreased due to sluggish sales and stalled construction. This is not because the raw materials come from the United States, which will be completely cut off in the future, but the market is firm and people are also weak. In the past ten days, the price of various grades of foreign pine has fallen by 100 to 200 yuan. The number of transactions in the market has been very few after the resumption of business. It is also reported that some firms in the industry have already completed orders for foreign pine and Russian spruce from the United States, and now various foreign firms have notified that the arrival of goods is indefinite, which will cause significant losses.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Drafts to Be Restored, Withdrawal Limits for Demand Deposits to Be Increased</h3>

The withdrawal limit for demand deposits is also being considered for increase.</p>
<h3>Announcement to the Public by the Japanese Military Police Commander</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Police Commander issued an announcement to the Chinese public, the content of which roughly stated that it is regrettable that people inside and outside the concession are devising malicious tactics regarding the rights and interests of enemy countries, or are driven by self-interest and greed, attempting to transport prohibited goods out of the concession, and are gradually spreading malicious rumors, creating anxiety among the people, and planning to expand the power of one party or faction. In the past, warnings were issued to Japanese residents that those who violate military regulations and laws, or harm the morality of the Japanese Empire, will be severely punished without leniency. Now, the same hope is extended to all Chinese citizens, that they exercise prudence and caution, and cooperate to maintain the peace and order of Greater Shanghai. Those who violate military regulations and laws will be severely punished. This announcement.</p>

<h3>Winter Solstice Today, Abnormally Warm Weather</h3>
<p>Today is the Winter Solstice. The season has deeply entered mid-winter, but the weather is very warm, suitable for wearing single-layer clothing. This abnormal weather is a cause for concern for spring plowing next year, as it is insufficient to kill hibernating insects. Also, there was heavy fog yesterday morning, which greatly hindered traffic. It took a long time for it to dissipate.</p>

<h3>Records of Lectures at the Rongwu Society</h3>
<p>The first lecture of the 28th term of the Rongwu Jingjing Society's Yijing (Book of Changes) course, by Yang Zhenru, was titled "Naming the Eight Essentials for Entering the Zhouyi (Book of Changes)." What is the Zhouyi? Yi is the name of the classic, and Zhou is the name of the dynasty. As Kong Zhongda said, "The Zhouyi of Zhou is like the Zhou Shu (Book of Zhou) and Zhou Li (Rites of Zhou), named Zhou to distinguish it from other dynasties." However, the Lian Shan and Gui Zang, which preceded the Zhou dynasty, no longer exist. The Yi that followed the Zhou dynasty, followed the Zhou dynasty in one aspect, it is not like the historical records, law, or method, which differ in their systems. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to name the Yi Zhou to distinguish it from other dynasties. Why is it still called the Zhouyi? Zheng Kangcheng's note on the Zhou Li Sanyi said: "The Lian Shan is like the clouds coming out of the mountains, continuously without end. The Gui Zang means that all things return and are stored within it. The Zhouyi means that the way of Yi is universal, without anything lacking." From this, we know that the Zhou of Zhouyi has a meaning besides distinguishing it from other dynasties. Now, this meaning is even more obvious because there is no need to distinguish it from other dynasties. Let us expand on Kangcheng's meaning and say that the Yi contains three meanings and the Zhou has three virtues. The three meanings are: 1. Unchanging: The Commentary says, "Heaven is honored, earth is humble, Qian and Kun are determined." 2. Changing: The Commentary says, "Movement and stillness have their constants, but change is appropriate." 3. Simple: The Commentary says, "Qian is easy to know, and Kun is simple to do." The three virtues are: 1. Comprehensive and complete: The Commentary says, "Encompassing heaven and earth, knowing all things." 2. Flowing and interconnected: The Commentary says, "Flowing up and down, subtly accomplishing everything." 3. Precise and profound: The Commentary says, "Exhaustively studying the depths, cleansing the heart and storing secrets." What is the door? The Commentary says, "Qian and Kun are the door of the Yi." What is entry? The Commentary says, "Heaven and earth are established, and the Yi moves within them, completing nature and preserving it, the measure of righteousness." Why must one enter through the door? The Commentary says, "Therefore, the superior man in his dwelling observes the images and contemplates the words, and in his movements observes the changes and contemplates the omens. Therefore, he is blessed by heaven, and there is good fortune without disadvantage." If one's heart is not steeped in the way of the Yi and one's body does not abide in the sea of righteousness, how can one dwell in peace and occupy auspicious omens? How to enter through the door? The Commentary says, "Opening the door is called Kun, closing the door is called Qian." This means that the way of Qian ends with Kun, and if one wishes to change and benefit to the fullest extent, and inspire to the utmost, one must still open it with the way of Qian. The Explanation of the Words for Qian's six Yao describes the method of learning in five ways: The first nine says, "A dragon's virtue but hidden, not changing the world, not achieving fame, retreating from the world without worry, not seen yet without worry, happy then acting, worried then withdrawing, truly unyielding, a hidden dragon." This is the learning of a recluse, cultivating oneself in poverty. The ninth three says, "Loyalty and sincerity are the means to advance, cultivating words and establishing sincerity are the means to abide in one's profession, knowing when to arrive and arriving is to be with opportunities, knowing when to end and ending is to preserve righteousness, therefore residing in a high position without arrogance, and in a low position without worry, therefore constantly vigilant in his time, though in danger without blame." This is the learning of a scholar-official, benefiting the world in success. The ninth two says, "A dragon's virtue and upright center, trusting in ordinary words, cautious in ordinary actions, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity, benefiting the world without boasting, virtue is broad and transforming." This is the learning of a village elder, even if one does not seek fame among the lords, one cannot forget one's family and country. The words "duke's virtue" clarify that it is not the duke's position. The ninth four says, "Up and down are not constant, not for evil, advancing and retreating are not constant, not leaving the group, the superior man advances in virtue and cultivates his profession, desiring to be in time." This is the learning of a hero of the times, desiring to test oneself in a leap, therefore not declining to be doubted by others. The words "without blame" mean desiring to advance in cultivation in time, not being rash to invite blame. The ninth five says, "Similar sounds respond to each other, similar qi seeks each other, water flows to dampness, fire goes to dryness, clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, the sage acts and all things are seen, those who are rooted in heaven are close to the top, those who are rooted in earth are close to the bottom, each follows its kind." This is the learning of a great man, and the Yi is the great man among learning, therefore it can unite its virtue with heaven and earth, unite its brightness with the sun and moon, unite its order with the four seasons, unite its fortune with the ghosts and gods, preceding heaven and heaven does not violate it, following heaven and obeying the time of heaven, distinguishing the eight essentials is to enable each to follow its kind. The Commentary says, "Things are gathered by type, and objects are divided by category." Someone asked, "Qian has six Yao, why is the number of learning five, is there something missing?" The answer is, "The meaning of 'excess' is knowing to advance but not knowing to retreat, knowing to exist but not knowing to perish, knowing to gain but not knowing to lose. In the world of the decline, evil and chaos are mixed, and cunning people think of arguing to achieve their private desires. They also firmly believe that it is learning, but how can it be compared to those who know to advance and retreat, exist and perish, and do not lose their correctness? Therefore, it should be rejected from our learning." Then Yang Zhongyi lectured on the changes of the innate and acquired trigram images (part one). 1. Innate, which is the fixed image. Heaven and earth are determined, the top is honored and the bottom is humble, the sun and moon run, rising in the east and setting in the west. This is the innate image, so it is the body. The Commentary on the Trigrams says, "Heaven and earth are positioned," Shao said, "This is the position of the Fuxi Eight Trigrams, the learning of the innate." According to the Book of Rites, "The sacrifice to heaven in the southern suburbs is solemn, like the image of Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Dui in the west." Han scholars say, "The former kings made rites, based on the Yi," which is sufficient to show the old tradition of the Confucian school. Qian says, "After heaven and earth were divided, Qian ascended and Kun descended," which is the same as the Commentary, "Heaven is honored and earth is humble, Qian and Kun are determined." Therefore, heaven and earth are positioned, Qian and Kun distinguish the upper and lower divisions, the Commentary says, "The sun and moon push each other, the sun and moon run," Yu's note says, "The sun is Li, the moon is Kan," therefore the sun and moon face each other, Kan and Li are arranged at the gates of east and west. Xueyuan's Yitu says, "Thunder comes out of the earth and moves heaven, wind rises from heaven and travels the earth, mountains are rooted in the earth and rise upwards, and marshes descend from heaven." Therefore, Dui and Xun belong to the upper, then wind and rain come from heaven, Gen and Zhen are placed below, then thunder comes out of the earth. This is the constant body of the Yi, like a phenomenon of the universe. At this point, it has been four seasons, and it is appropriate to announce that the Chinese Studies course will be launched.</p>

<h3>Women's Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Dr. Griffith once said in a magazine: "There is only one profession and business in the world that does not require any preparation before engaging in it, and that is marriage." I think this is really a mistake, because after forming a small family, many household affairs cannot be learned in a day, and knowledge of sexual knowledge, child rearing, etc., requires a long period of research. If you do not prepare in advance before marriage, you cannot have good results.</p>
<p>The female novelist Fannie Hurst (who wrote "Back Street" and other books) said it appropriately: "If you educate a man, you are only educating one person. If you educate a woman, you educate a family." It can be seen that women's cultivation is important, because her every move has a close relationship with every member of the family, and naturally has a great indirect impact on society.</p>
<p>We have received many letters from readers saying that their wives, regardless of their meager income, only know how to advocate luxury, and even complain about the lack of income. The reason for this situation is that these wives lack cultivation. At a time when it is difficult to make ends meet, every couple should learn the spirit of the musician Mozart. The Mozart couple did not have money to buy coal to make a fire on a cold day, so they danced in the house to increase their body temperature.</p>
<p>Ibsen was not an advocate of women's politics, but he believed that the foundation of marriage must be built on loyal, free, and wise companions. Full cultivation is a prerequisite for creating the foundation he established.</p>

<h3>A Father Who Teaches His Child to Hit and Scold</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>Our parents are both around fifty years old. Besides having us five sisters, they finally fulfilled their long-cherished wish six years ago.</p>
<p>This was indeed a joyful occasion. After having five daughters in a row, Heaven actually bestowed upon them a son. And it was in their old age. No wonder Father, who always had a frowning face, smiled broadly ever after, and became much more energetic in his work. Father always insisted that daughters are outsiders, like water thrown out, and only raising a son brings success. Mother, even more so, thanked Heaven and Earth, saying that our younger brother was a life-saving bodhisattva, saving our whole family! It meant Father didn't have to take a concubine, and there was someone to inherit the family property. As for us, we were all extremely happy because we had gained a sibling of the opposite sex. However, misfortune began with this!</p>
<p>Father runs a millet shop, and Mother is illiterate. So, after our younger brother could speak, Father asked, "Child, what will you be when you grow up?" Then Mother spoke first, "Bao Shi will be a big boss, earning lots of money, living in a Western-style house, riding in a car, and eating fancy meals." Soon after, our younger brother could speak. He would say things like, "Sisters are women, they have to rely on men, they can't earn big money to support Mom and Dad; Bao Bao is a man, he can be a boss, a high official." "Get out of here, old servant! The big boss, the young master, is here, hurry up and pour tea! Clang, dong... clang! You're only fit to flatter the boss!"... Then the parents beside him would laugh heartily. The shop assistants would also join in the fun.</p>
<p>The gloom grew thicker, and our younger brother slowly learned to hit and scold people and other bad behaviors. The story is like this: On some day, Father said, "Bao Bao, can you hit Daddy? Hit him, try it, raise your little fist..." The younger brother did as he was told! "Haha, Bao Bao hit someone! Bao Bao, go kick Mommy, go kick! Kick her, and I'll buy you candied chestnuts to eat, go!" The younger brother obediently ran over: behind him, Father added, "Raise your little foot, harder! Ah, good!" After being kicked by the younger brother, Mom smiled sweetly, picked up the younger brother, kissed him, and then said, "Bao Bao, scold Daddy, scold him, 'old pig, old thing'!"</p>
<p>"Daddy is an old thing, an old pig." Subsequently, "Sisters are women" and other words were always on the younger brother's lips, he simply sang it like a folk song every day, alas! Younger brother.</p>
<p>Even more unexpectedly, our schooling was also affected by our younger brother! Our parents have definitely told us that if a daughter graduates from junior high school, she cannot continue her studies.</p>
<p>To save our younger brother and to make our parents realize the truth quickly, we have repeatedly advised them, but we have repeatedly received a scolding, because "an old-age son" is not easy to come by, it requires accumulated virtue from previous generations, good feng shui in the ancestral hall, and descendants doing good deeds. He must be a virtuous boy descended from heaven, with inherent qualities. You all seem to have a conscience now, but when you rely on men in the future, you will forget us, alas! What can we do?</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>Chinese families are truly diverse and full of strange things. The painful complaints of these five sisters are easy to imagine. However, in this environment, one can only endure on the one hand and try to give parents some hints on the other, because to achieve practical results, a drastic method will not produce perfect results. Only by dealing with it calmly (but not compromising), and at the same time, not relaxing the pursuit of knowledge, it is best to study one or two practical subjects to achieve economic independence. It is truly a gratifying thing that five sisters have like minds and are together.</p>
<p>As for that young and ignorant younger brother, when he leaves his parents and enters the embrace of the school, he will gradually get rid of his wrong ideas.</p>

<h3>A Week's Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>These few days, all prices have been rising again. Our seven necessities of life are certainly no exception. But there is one thing that is an exception: fresh ribbonfish are very cheap, the smaller ones cost five or six cents per tael, and the larger ones only cost seven or eight cents, probably because there is a large supply, flooding the market. Among fish, fresh ribbonfish give people a very good impression because they don't have many bones and are easy to remove, so even children can eat them safely. There are several ways to cook them: one is steaming, which makes the meat tender, but you need to add some scallions, ginger, and diced lard. A strong soy sauce is excellent, making the flavor very fresh. Another way is braising in soy sauce, which doesn't require any accompaniments. If you like sweet and sour, you can add sugar and vinegar. If you don't like sugar and vinegar, if you have rice wine lees, you can spread it on top and braise it together, the taste is not bad either.</p>

<p>(151) Stir-fried Cabbage with Crab Roe (Draft by Yao Kechang)</p>
<p>Ingredients: Four or five crabs, cooking wine, Tianjin cabbage, scallions, ginger, lard, vegetable oil, salt, monosodium glutamate</p>
<p>Preparation: First boil the crabs until cooked, remove the crab meat, mix it with ginger shreds, scallion slices, cooking wine, etc., and stir-fry it in lard and set aside. Separately, wash the cabbage, chop it, add an appropriate amount of monosodium glutamate and salt, then stir-fry it with vegetable oil. When it is cooked, spread the stir-fried crab roe on top of the cabbage, cover and simmer for a moment, then serve.</p>
<p>Turning one food item into many ways of eating it is inherently not easy. Moreover, crabs are always boiled first and then the crab roe is extracted, making it more difficult to change than raw chicken, duck, fish, and meat. However, the ways of eating and the taste of crabs are distinguished by the different dishes they are paired with and the skill of the preparation.</p>
<p>Gentlemen: If you wish to purchase "monosodium glutamate," "Heaven's Kitchen soy sauce extract," and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594," and a special delivery person will be sent immediately without charging a delivery fee.</p>

<h3>It's Hard to Cook Without Rice</h3>
<p>— Liao Ran</p>
<p>As long as one is a person with feelings, upon arriving at a crossroads and seeing the tense and precarious situation of the masses buying rice and coal briquettes, one will inexplicably feel a sense of sorrow; this sense of sorrow comes more from "self-pity" than from compassion. Nowadays, whether rich or poor, no one dares to be complacent. "Even with ponds and birds and beasts, how can one be happy alone?"</p>
<p>"The old and weak are left to die in ditches," this is not yet the case, even the strong are trembling with fear of being on the verge of extinction. Ordinary citizens need money to survive: if money is not easy to come by, there is only death. Thus, they first hang the young, then strangle the old, and then seek death themselves. In this way, a large group dies silently. If Heaven does not cut off all hope and they occasionally get money, then they can buy rice, start a fire, and cook porridge, but looking at the group of old and young, and then looking at themselves, having to seek survival in a line of six or seven hundred people, they are wailing and stamping their feet in long sighs. Here is an ordinary and true story: A certain employee of a certain company went to work in the morning, and walked home leisurely at noon for lunch. There was still no grain of rice in the pot. In a fit of anger, he questioned his wife. As for the wife, "'The little stars, three or five in the east, silently journeying at night, are busy day and night in public service'," at four in the morning, she abandoned the hungry crying baby and went to line up to buy rice. A weak woman with no strength to tie up a chicken, how could she be up to the task in the crowded and hungry crowd, being stepped on was not the only thing that happened, she almost lost the money. Returning home at noon, her hands were empty, it was still hard to cook without rice. The sadness in her heart can be imagined, and she also had to endure her husband's ridicule, anger and resentment flared up, and soon she secretly hanged herself in the back room. The husband discovered it and seemed to have no way, and also sought death.</p>
<p>There are even more ways for other groups of suicides to die, but they are all people who could not seek life.</p>
<p>In this year, the fine line "It is common for scholars to starve to death" may be a self-deprecating remark, but if one can find time to recite it, one will not die now; I think those who have some strength can still think of ways for the truly ordinary people!</p>
<p>The authorities have indeed made their best efforts for the people's livelihood problem in the past month, which is obvious to everyone. Now the masses have indeed reached the most painful time. The most benevolent people in the world, even if they are scorched, will not hesitate to think for the people. "People cannot live without water and fire, and in the evening, they knock on people's doors to ask for water and fire, and no one refuses." If there is grain like water and fire, then it is up to the Public Works Bureau authorities to make greater efforts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Has No Night View</h3>
<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>After the invention of neon lights, the night view of the city has been decorated to be extremely brilliant and beautiful. Some people, on a misty night, climbed high and looked far, marveling at it as a wonder of the world. Although I have not had the experience of admiring the lights on a misty night, but having seen goldfish swimming in a glass tank, I guess that the neon light through the water vapor does have a miracle that pleases the eye. Therefore, even the ×× used clothing store, which has little to do with "business sense," once installed red and blue neon lights on the upper floor of the Great World, and indeed viewers gathered.</p>
<p>Now that trams have entered the depot at nine o'clock and household electricity use has been reduced to 80 percent, neon lights are naturally no longer the pride of the city at night. If that gentleman has that kind of enthusiasm again and looks out from a high place, even on a night with a bright moon in the sky, he will dejectedly exclaim: "Shanghai has no night view!"</p>
<p>In fact, the past nights in Shanghai were indeed brilliant and beautiful, but how much spirit and money were wasted under the lights? How many evils happened in the night market? Therefore, the current "early closing" is an emergency measure by the authorities to save electricity, but Shanghai people immersed in nightlife have indeed gained a good opportunity to get rid of bad habits, and at the same time, getting up early and going to bed early is also of great benefit to health. However, don't think that the electric light at home can still cope, so gather four people and sit around the table, playing mahjong until dawn, a fine of five yuan is still a small matter (French Concession regulations: those whose mahjong sounds reach outdoors after twelve o'clock at night will be fined five yuan), exceeding the electricity limit and having the wires cut, then you will really have to taste the dark life.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>15. Daddy, let's go busking!</p>
<p>So, after the landlady of this small inn made arrangements, Mei Bao became close to the girl surnamed Han in room 17 downstairs; the next day, he pulled Mr. Han upstairs to have a meal with Begonia, and everyone, in a situation of shared sympathy, agreed on a cooperation method. Although Mei Bao and the Han girl's singing skills were very different, it was not easy for outsiders to distinguish them; however, the Shandong man surnamed Han played the huqin too badly, and after a trial performance, it was decided that when going out to busk, Begonia would play the instrument completely, and the man surnamed Han would only use a second fiddle as accompaniment.</p>
<p>But Begonia did not suffer a loss either, because the man surnamed Han had many fellow villagers and knew many street heroes, which was of course a great help to their business. Therefore, after the cooperation began, everything went smoothly. There was only one thing that always made Begonia feel very unhappy, and that was the audience's attitude towards Mei Bao.</p>
<p>"I never thought we would be reduced to this!" He often sighed like this (284)</p>
<h3>I Bought Rice! Only One Sheng</h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>In the morning, I received two yuan and sixty cents from my father and took a "flour sack" from my mother to go to the market to buy rice. At first, I was a little coy, but finally straightened my back and strode towards the long line of people.</p>
<p>It was early, and the shops on the street had not yet opened. The iron gate of the ×× rice shop was tightly closed, with a wooden door as a rear guard, and there was no movement inside, but the front of the door was bustling, with people swarming and pushing each other, standing in a long snake formation.</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute, but more and more people joined in. It's almost ten o'clock, why hasn't it opened yet? The morning cold was so biting that the people who were close to each other stood even closer, but everyone hadn't eaten breakfast. Little Sanzi, who sells sesame cakes, was busy in the alley, and everyone swallowed saliva at him! My feet were a little sore and numb, but there was no way. Finally, the wooden door of the rice shop was only half opened, and "161" was written on the sleeve of my right arm in white powder. The formation was moving, and everyone was wriggling and shouting again!</p>
<p>The shadow of the utility pole next to it changed from oblique and long to almost gone before it reached my head. One hand sent in the money, and then one hand handed the flour sack into the two-foot square iron hole—the source of life—seeing the rice, I forgot the pain in my feet.</p>
<p>"Change a one-dollar bill!" A sudden thunderbolt shocked me. Could it be fake?</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" I asked cautiously, softly.</p>
<p>"Don't you have eyes! Look at this rotten bill!" The roar was like a tiger's, and the money had already been thrown on the rice bag. On one side, he began to receive the money from the people behind me.</p>
<p>The fire in my heart was burning and almost burst out, but when I thought of my mother's anxious situation looking at the empty pot at this time, I had to suppress my temper.</p>
<p>"Just buy one sheng!" I said softly!</p>
<p>The flour sack was only filled with rice at the two corners, and I took it back lifelessly. I really wanted to cry. I stood for four full hours, squeezed, fought, scolded, felt sore, felt pain, felt hungry, "bending my waist for a sheng of rice"!</p>
