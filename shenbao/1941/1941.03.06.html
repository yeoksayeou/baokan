<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德關係的新變化</h3>
<p>德軍人保之後，首先引起的反應是蘇聯突然放棄其年餘以來對德的曲意周旋，打破其若干時日以來的沉機觀變態度，以對保的譴責暗示其對德的非難。此一動作，出之於德方在巴爾幹的攻勢已成如箭在弦的今日，無寧嫌其過遲，因而亦難斷言其對於歐洲東南的危局究能發生何等實際效果；然亦任何人當均能體會此其含義的重大，除却足以袪除若干疑慮而外，假如關係國家能夠迅速把握住這一契機，推誠運用，則國際局勢當能從此步人一個新的皆段。</p>
<p>當土保不侵協定締結之初，一般揣測多以爲出自蘇方背後運用，及至保當局更以急轉直下的姿態投入軸心懷抱，並允許德軍入保，又多疑爲是蘇方予以縱容。是以隔昨蘇聯的聲明，不只證明了蘇聯對於德保最近行徑已經超過了容忍的限度，而所聲明並未與聞土保談判，亦可信爲眞實。蘇聯對巴爾幹的關切與夫納粹對巴爾幹的覬覦，事屬舉世共曉，而彼此之間更是相知有素，今次乃竟不能在事前覓取妥協的途徑，以致到此際暴露了雙方利益與見解的紛歧，可見蘇聯自有其堅定獨立的立塲，並不一定爲了樂見帝國主義國家的厮殺而一味予納粹以支援。同時，更有理由可以相信蘇方斷不僅以對保照會爲止境，在這一聲明之外，必更有若干實際運用的步驟相與配合，而且這又必然與德方在巴爾幹的優勢與勝利成正比例而擴大。</p>
<p>這一情勢的發生，應該視爲希特勒的「千慮一疏」。蓋希氏以至其他的侵略者，歷來皆是最善於尋覓蘇聯與民治國家之間的猜忌矛盾而遂其侵略的企圖；一九三一的遠東事變，與夫一九三九的歐陸戰爭，便都是這樣發生的。民治國家若干保守者流，在思想與制度方面的對蘇成見，更在彼此之間深深劃成一道鴻溝，幾乎使雙方在政治軍事方面必要的提携成爲不可能；因而益復刺激克來姆林宮恐怖外來威脅的心理，提高其中立自保的情緒。蘇聯與納粹的接近，與其說是自願，無寗說造因於彼時民治國家的對蘇成見；故蘇德之間，雖有嶄新的互不侵犯條的之存在，但彼此神情上不時流露其互相戒懼，可見這一關係始終在不自然的情况下繼續發展，而允以三國盟的成立之後爲最顯著。英美當局雖然看到了爭取蘇聯的可能與必要，却始終不曾毅然決然的積極從事；察其所取作風，較之一九三九春夏間，英法與蘇聯之間的互助談判，並不見有若干進步。英國克利浦斯的使蘇，與訂立英蘇協定的建議，美總統對蘇道德禁運的解除，都是可喜的現象，但却又狃於若干阻力與成見，不能繼之以進一步的表現。同時，還有以蘇聯和納粹義日等量齊觀的見解，指摘蘇聯以美國貨物資德的抨擊，反而充塞英美論壇；不僅未能像納粹當局已往對蘇簽的那樣當機立斷，甚且不如日本當局期望調整對蘇關係之旣殷且切；如此逡巡，而欲擊潰軸心，戢止太平洋上的侵略慘禍，雖曰事非不可能，亦必然要事倍功半。幸而蘇方自有其堅定不拔的立塲，其與軸心國家之間根本存在着若千不可調和的矛盾，假如眞像若干英美人士所指摘的那樣，完全與軸心國家沆瀣一氣，則此際國際形勢將呈何狀，正是難於想像了。</p>
<p>蘇聯與德國意見上的分岐，固然尚不能驟視之爲對於民治國家的接近；但就其反對納粹軍力向巴爾幹與黑海門戶發展一點而言，則與民治國家的立塲却是一致的。本月二日蘇駐美大使烏曼斯基向威爾斯保證美國運蘇物品悉由蘇聯自用的聲明，更可見蘇聯爲了由美國取得所需的物資，也並不顧慮其是吾會引起納粹的反感。這些情勢都應視爲造就未來國際前途的重要因素。另一方面，納粹當局此次竟將蘇聯對於巴爾幹，特別對於保國的關切，置之不顧而悍然囊括保國，殆因他幻想他自己已經是一個稱覇的勝利者而目中無人，亦因他覷定了蘇聯在這一戰局中祗是一個「澈底的和平政策主義者」的角色，允因爲納粹鑒於他的夥計處境之危迫，已不容再作他所認爲事實上小必要的從容佈置與選擇。這樣悍然不顧的後果，固未容作過早的預言，但是爲了對於最後勝負並無決定作用的巴爾幹，暴露了自身的弱點，招致了深刻的磨阻，在納粹絕非爲計之得；這在民治國與蘇聯之間，却因此而得消除了若干疑慮與隔閡。</p>
<p>但是要奠定絕大多數人的福利，僅僅上述的消長程度是不濟事的。關於太平洋方面的一切，蔣委員長曾說遠東的和平必須中美蘇三國的永遠合作；關於歐洲爲中心的局勢，美國若干專家也認爲惟英美蘇的聯合纔能肅淸禍根；這是透剔的觀察，這是不易的眞理。</p>

<h3>糧食　全市洋米就到存作估計　應有一百八十萬包　均爲大囤戶凍結死藏　將陷大衆生活於絕地　－有責者不得辭其咎－</h3>

<p>小麥　昨日市况、依然堅硬、福新廠定麥一船、因有受潮、尚在整理、阜豐廠旣無洋麥接濟、亦無法製粉供應、故在原料缺乏之際、市面幾無日不俏、國產杜麥、祗有喊盤、而無實交</p>

<h3>金市盤漲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、祇半日買賣、交易雖旺、而上落較小、高低不過五十餘元、此因經營者信心不堅、進出仍於迷離之中、首於大豐成記購買下、挺至六千三百四十五元、而恒記等每見乘高吐售、漲勢阻止、惟因觀察日來遠東形勢、似稍鬆懈、故買進者尚多、價格盤旋甚穩、市收結果六千三百三十元、比上日升四十元、又現貨價本日比期交大四百九十元、曾有永豐餘售予聯興五十兩、半日交易數量總在一萬五千兩左右、首飾金復大十元、爲七百元、關金等平、</p>

<h3>棉市杳無起色</h3>
<p>現棉情况平凡、實際需要依然暗淡、加之紗市不振、所以人心孱弱也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因南方幫套賣而跌、續後又因棉布貿易良好、及同業買進回漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日上昇一至四磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉因有多數空頭抵補而漲、昨日連同預測挺進四羅比左右</p>

<h3>保財妙法（續）</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>（一）節約建國儲金</p>
<p>節的建國儲金是由中央信託局·中國銀行·交通銀行·中國農民銀行·郵政儲金匯業局奉國民政府的命令辦的。這種儲金的安全保障有三重，第一規定此項儲金只能投放於開墾土地，與修水利，發展農林畜牧，興辦工廠，修築鐵路，發達航業，開採鑛產等等生產事業，以投資於此項生產事業的股票債券作爲儲金的第一保證準備。第二規定此項儲金的會計獨立，盈虧情形不和各行局的一般業務的盈虧混合。第三規定此項儲金除由各行局直接向儲戶負責外，再由政府保證本息的安全。所以從安全的觀點說，節的建國儲金，可以說是最可靠的。</p>
<p>爲適應存戶的需要起見，分甲乙兩種：甲種是「活存定取」，存入後可隨時加存，每半年複利一次。乙種分「整存整付」「零存整付」「整存零付」「存本取息」四種。期限自三年至十年，利率自週息七厘半至一分。</p>
<p>節的建國儲金條例於一九三八年十一月二十九日由國府公佈，茲再摘錄兩條重要條文如後：第七條「節的建國儲金得以外國貨幣存儲，滿期後仍以外國貨幣償付本息。其以現金銀存儲者，並依照財政部兌換法幣補充辦法及金類兌換法幣辦法照加手續費，併人本金計算。」第八條「節的建國儲金存摺凡公務上須繳保證金時得作爲代替品。」</p>
<p>（二）節約建國儲蓄券</p>
<p>國府繼節的建國儲金後，叉創辦儲蓄券。一九三九年九月十二日國府公怖節的建國儲蓄條例，同年十二月十四日財部公佈節的建國儲蓄券條例施行細則。節建儲券是節建儲金的一種，其投資範圍的限制以及安全的保障，都是相同的。券分甲乙兩種，甲種券爲記名式，可以掛失及補發，但五百元以下的小券，得不肥名發行，憑劵領款，於存滿六個月後，即可提取本息。乙種券爲不記名式，可以自由的轉讓或贈予，購券時先將利息扣除，可由少於券面的金錢買到券面較高的儲蓄券，到期時憑劵面金額領取法幣，故期限愈長購券所須款額愈少。</p>
<p>甲乙兩種儲蓄劵都分爲五元·十元·五十元·一百元·五百元·一千元·一萬元七種，期限自六個月至十年。利率原定六厘至八厘半不等，一九四〇年九月五日四聯總處理事會議決增高各種儲蓄存款利率辦法中規定：甲種券存滿半年增加紅利合滿八厘，存滿五年者增加紅利合滿一分一厘，存滿十年者增加紅利合滿一分二厘；乙種券一年以上者到期另給紅利合滿利率一分，二年至四年一分零五毫，五年至七年一分一厘，八年至九年一分一厘半，十年一分二厘。</p>
<p>節的建國儲蓄券也可作爲公務上的保證金，並可作爲地方銀行發行輔幣券的保證準備。持券人即在儲蓄期間也可利用作種種用途，同時仍可獲取利息。國內各著名商業銀行均可代購，戰區內的人士也可利用通信的方法購買，故購取便利。而且中央信託局·中國銀行·交通銀行聯合發行節儲券，和中國農民銀行互相兌付儲蓄劵，故不但加强節儲券的信用，更對於購券人非常便利。</p>

<h3>工部局董事會討論　節减電流供給量　申請新裝電流不再接受　局方並將協助獲致煤觔</h3>
<p>據昨日自可靠方面所得之消息稱、工部局所組織之硏究電流供給問題委員會、經二星期之硏究後、已提出一建議書、主張立即節减電流供給量之百分之三十、聞工部局董事會昨日下午四時三十分、召開例會時、曾將該項建議提出討論、已有決議、惟辦法法昨日未及公佈、據消息靈　人士傳出之消息稱、工部局無論有何決議、上海電力公司皆將予以接受、上海人士對於工部局所決定、不再接受請求給馬達電新申請一舉、皆表示接受、因此舉為協助電力公可解決燃料缺乏問題良好辦法之一、同時對於原有用戶、亦為有利之舉、</p>
<p>新申請者概不供給</p>
<p>聞小組會建議電力之减少、祇可逐漸質行、而工部局協助電力公司獲所船隻、載運必要的煤斤與燃料來滬、工部局協助電力公司應付現局之第一步驟為宣布「因燃料短絀、到貨困難、自即日盧迄另發通吿之日為止、凡續有申請供給電力者、上海電力公司將一律不予接受」</p>
<p>勞工情勢益臻困難</p>
<p>開工部局此項決議、將影響上海電力公司所供給各種方式之電流服務、例如私人寓所中不能添裝電流設備、而在新寓所中亦不能新裝電流用具、同時本市工業界對電流供給之諒將减少事正加密切注意、若干人士預料减電一舉或將使本市勞工情勢、益增困難、蓋萬一减電、各大工廠許多工人、將不得不停工也、</p>
<p>日紡織業竟表不滿</p>
<p>哈瓦斯世界電訊　四日東京電、據日本紀事報載稱、上海電力公司、近以煤斤缺乏、將各工廠電力供給量减少百分之四十、上海日商各紗廠內須减工百分之五十、但畢商與外商各廠、雖亦受同樣限制、仍能全部開工、大阪紡織協會聞訊之餘、異常不滿、爰於上月二十日開會、決議請求政府出面交涉、該會秘書長東川、昨已啟程前來、俾與政府接洽此事、</p>
<p>煤斤供給尙無恐慌</p>
<p>昨　煤　領袖某君　、　電力公司之建議節减電流、決非煤來源行將斷絕之謂、其惟一意　、乃因鑒於運輸較以往困難、不得不採取未雨綢繆之預防措置、節减不必要　消耗、　三月份有海防白煤三萬頓可到滬、烟煤來源、亦不致缺乏、故煤球供給、絕不致發生恐慌、上海存煤、足供三四月之需、　運輸船隻缺乏、自係事實、然煤葉當盡其最大之努力、使煤塊來源、連綿不斷、望市民勿過事競相囤儲、影響存量、　處此動盪之局面下、各業與全體孤島市民、應緊密合作、風雨同舟、共渡時艱、不應以一已之利益為前提、故煤業界已盡其可能、不使煤價上漲、</p>
<h3>國際大飯店　無出售訉</h3>

<p>拒不發表任何言論</p>

<h3>長城吟</h3>
<p>— 祝敔</p>
<p>我是長城！</p>
<p>宇宙間可算不朽的，我是一個；宇宙間可以算威嚴的，我也是一個。誰不說長城是威嚴的？誰能同我比擬？運河是我的弟弟，有部份却癱瘓了：琉璃塔同我一比，只覺其嬌小；羅馬的鬥塲只剩了骨骼；而巴比倫的空中花園也變了地下的荒壚。我彷彿與地球同來，我也顯示出人的最高的創造！</p>
<p>埃及的金字塔怎樣？不也是蒼老而雄巍？</p>
<p>我聽了呵呵大笑。金字塔是我的哥哥，可是他只保護一個人，一個死了的專制魔王。我呢？我咆哮起來，大地的心臟也震動了！我保護千萬個人，千萬個活着的生命！</p>
<p>黃沙百里，高山千仭，原野盡在我的眼底：我像盤古氏一樣仲出粗壯的雙臂，把一半土地抱了起來，虎視耽耽，銅筋鐵骨，沒有一點動搖。誰敢闖進來？誰想來奪我懷拘裹的民衆？</p>
<p>風來告訴我匈奴的騎隊來了。</p>
<p>我沉默着，因爲我知道自己的力量。匈奴是來了，馬兒捲過來，喊聲如潮，刀兵在揮動；但對於我，這些値什麼？我屹立不動，每塊肌肉都格格作響，每個關節也都緊緊收縮起來。胡騎近了，我準備同他們厮殺！瞧吧！萬箭從我頭頂射出，接着是無數大石，滾木，火把，蒺藜，衝向來犯的北蠻。我打穩脚跟，咬緊牙齒，使出混身勁，不讓一騎衝過。金鼓雷動，天嘯地驚，胡兵倒了，汲了，敗了，沙塲上堆滿了他們的破甲和折劍，還有他們的斷肢和殘骸。</p>
<p>長城，偉大的長城！有人向我歡呼。</p>
<p>世紀過去，北騎倒在我的下面，一次又一次而我依舊無恙，我的民衆依舊剛强。－黃沙百里，高山千仭，原野盡在我的眼底：祖國的脈搏一直在跳，未曾中斷。每當黎明，國旗在金角聲中升上我的碉樓，我的血又年靑了，我知道我始終守着中國的邊疆，我知道我的責任是什麼。</p>
<p>此番風又來告訴我：匈奴的騎隊來了。</p>
<p>我難道　屈服？幾千年來我不會屈服過！我當更堅强地站立着！我要保護中華！瞧吧！英勇的抵禦在進行中！</p>

<h3>惡藪一隅</h3>
<p>— 史晋</p>
<p>我是個沒有父母的孤兒。去年從淪陷區裹逃出來後，就住在唯一的親戚家裹。他們開設着小小的藥舖，以半個廂房作爲店面，半個廂房作爲臥室。因爲人太多，不够住，所以在臥室中又搭了個擱樓。本來光綫不足的半個廂房，更顯得黑暗了。</p>
<p>三十年前，在熱閙的南京路上，我住的那條弄堂，可算很上等的紳商寓客之所。到了現在，情形不變。雖沒有長一么二堂子，可是嚮導姑娘却塞滿這條弄堂。我曾細細地與他們計算一下，平均每一戶佔着三個。另外當然也有賣黑飯的舖子與暗娼。除了他們以外，好好的人家，祗佔百分之十左右，各科醫生却也佔了百分之十。</p>
<p>我所住的宅子裹，雖只二幢二下，而人家却住了八家。樓下客堂間與後面三小間分租與四家，他們的生活都依靠着他們的『女兒』來維持。樓上就是暗娼與黑飯舖，在黃昏時，面如死灰雙肩高抬的烟鬼們，絡繹不絕地懶懶地踏十了扶梯。回下來的時候，就顯得神氣些，把樓梯也震得饗些。另一方面，暗娼們臉上塗滿了紅的白的，活像棺材裹爬出來的殭屍；二個在前面走，後面就跟着個老媽子。她們是到屋頂花園或馬路上去兜攬她們的『生意』的。而那批嚮導姑娘也打扮妖妖艷艷的坐了包車，上她們的總社，預備分頭『工作』。</p>
<p>我是學生，每日下午自校中返家，一踏進門檻，就被刺具的琴聲擾亂了我平靜的心境。尖銳的唱聲，更勾起了我各種念頭。活潑的孩子的臉也就閃露在面前。那是不同姓的姊妹三人，由她們的乾娘扶養着。她又特地爲她們請了位琴師，每日下午來敎她們唱戲。到了相當年齡，乾娘就可以利上加利地把木錢撈回，並且還可以大大的賺上一筆。只費了幾年的心血，就可坐吃到老，像這樣的好生意，他們叉何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>最大的女孩名字叫做景弟，只十四歲。她的妹妹才十歲。另外一位妹妹只九歲。雖然她們每日受乾娘以『榮利』爲課本的敎訓，可是天眞之心還沒有失去。</p>
<p>某日晚上，我問景弟有沒有讀過書？她說：「讀過三年，我很願意讀書。」可是媽說我年紀大了，女孩兒家只要能識幾個字就可以了。還是給我學唱戲吧！只要唱戲學會了，就可以賺錢，何必再去讀書呢？所以在前年就不去學校了。『媽說的，明年春天叫我到公司裹去唱羣芳會。』當她說到唱羣芳會的當見，嘴角露出得意的微笑。</p>
<p>她的話使我的心感着無名的痛苦。我很想糾止她的錯誤觀念可是她的。乾娘來叫她去睡了。我不便再與她談什麼。</p>
<p>我一聽到琴聲，就想到二三年後，又有個純潔的少女將被犧牲在這萬惡的淵藪了。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鵑</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>「不是我不肯幫忙，這位太太其實不好說話！不信吳老板將來可以問七爺。」</p>
<p>重賞之下，必有勇夫的念頭，突然擁上，趙叫的腦神經來；他瞧季兆雄長着一張有皮無肉的臉，再配上一副鷹爪似的鼻子，便知道他決不是一個安分的傢伙。</p>
<p>「老大哥，只要你幫一次忙，我們決不會白白地辛苦你的！」趙四堆着滿臉的假笑說。</p>
<p>這一句話的力量可眞不小，季兆雄的臉上，頓時就有了一些笑意；經不起趙四再湊在他耳朶邊說了一陣鬼話，他果然便答應了。</p>
<p>「吳老板，這就要瞧你自己的運氣了！」季兆雄一路走進去，一路這樣說。他自己對於道一件事，顯然也的確沒有什麼把握。</p>
<p>「第一關才算打通了！」趙四把半個屁股沾在一張沙發上，透着心思很不定的神氣說。</p>
<p>秋海棠也忍不住深深地嘆了一口氣，他不但知道趙四所說的第一關，就是指季兆雄的肯不肯進去回話；而且知道還有第二關和第三關，就是那位姨太太肯不肯給自己去向胡督軍說情，以及有了胡督軍的面子，不知道沈麻子方　還要提出什麼條件來。</p>
<p>但事實的演變，往往總是出人意外的；秋海棠和趙四面面相覷地坐候了十多分鐘，季兆雄已歡天喜地的跳出來了。　「我可沒有給你白跑，太太馬上就要出來了…！只是，吳老板，別忘了方才趙叫哥的話！」底下一句他說得很低，差不多像耳語一樣，但它的重要性是很明顯的，趙四和秋海棠兩人不由便同時向他點了點頭。（四七）</p>

<h3>譚現代生行十二傑</h3>
<p>— 李雲影</p>
<p>從程長庚，余三勝，譚鑫增，劉鴻聲，在笑濃，孫菊仙等老輩相繼逝世之後，生行中後起者，迄今亦僅有十二人，於此可見梨園人材凋零一斑。俗云：「十年可中一狀元，十年難出一傑伶。」誠者斯言耶？</p>
<p>余叔岩　乃余三勝之孫，小余三勝之子，少年即有小小余三勝之譽。藝宗譚派，歌喉天賦，淸亮甜潤，文武崑亂，均所不擋。即身段台步，亦絕無俗氣，堪稱爐火純靑，其能執鬚生牛耳者，殊非偶然。惜邇來病於便血，體弱難支，絕跡歌壇，業經數載於茲，今後如欲再覩佳作，恐將望穿秋水，亦無日矣。</p>
<p>孟小冬　堪稱叔岩之傳人，雖坤伶而無雌音，嗓蒼老且有勁，台步扮相及身段等，莫不循規蹈矩。如「空城計」「探母」「捉放」「奇寃報」「駡曹」等戲均爲其傑作。自與畹華離婚後，杜絕賓客，埋頭研究，近在寓中，時以焚香念佛爲事，大有看破紅塵之概。惟視藝如命，邇來延老伶工鮑吉祥爲之說戲，抽暇更向叔岩處請益，前途殊非限量。</p>
<p>言菊朋　爲一十足羊毛下海，原宗譚派，晚近年事漸邁，氣短嗓狹，故別創一格，行腔多趨纖巧奇險，以其頗俱學識，對音韻研求，不遺餘力，致唱出之字，雖較他伶爲準，但亦病於過火，遂有怪腔之譏。言有二子二女，長子少朋，拜馬連良學藝。次子小朋，習武生，均係可造之材。長女月前下嫁一外行。次女慧珠，前歲曾隨其父來滬，一度打泡黃金，戲目爲「扈家莊」「駡殿」「慶頂珠」等，紅極一時，旋又爲電影界聘請拍攝「三娘敎子」一片。</p>
<p>馬連良　字溫如，回敎徒，坐科富連成，昔年藝宗賈洪林，因病於嗓瘖，演戲多徧重做工，如「一捧雪」「羣英會」「盜宗卷」「淸官冊」「十道本」等戲，爲其擅長。年前來滬，聆其嗓音，似較前爲佳。連良生平過人處，亦即扮相佔一「帥」字，別無足取，其馬派戲能盛行一時，蓋因北伶嗓昔不健者，多即以習馬派爲號召故耳，亦正如江南之多麒派，南北相映，誠非無獨有偶。</p>
<p>楊寶森　坐科斌慶社，有兄曰寳忠，同習生行。弟寳義，習旦，前歲病逝。寳森最忠叔岩，唱，念，做，以致台步，身段，無不力摹，惜臉無戲容，邇來嗓音大佳，有蒼勁，俱韻味，前聆其「二進宮」「探母」「空城計」等戲，殊爲過癮。其年事尚靑，如能苦幹研求，繼叔岩之衣鉢，亦非難事耳。</p>
<p>奚嘯伯　亦係票友下海，藝集余，言，馬三派之大成。人極聰慧，堪稱今日生行後起第一人。如「空城計」「探母回令」「駡曹」等余派戲，演來頗見長。即言派之「上天台」「讓徐州」「呑吳恨」等。亦爲其擅，甚至「借東風」「甘露寺」「一捧雪」一路馬派傑作，演來亦惟妙惟肖。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>「月宮寶盒」花絮</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>英國影片事業在世界市塲尚能從好萊塢處分得一杯羹，應歸功於亞力山大柯達。他原非英國人民，誕生於匈牙利，後始與其二弟在倫敦從事攝製，初默默無聞，直至却爾斯勞頓主演之「法宮秘史」問世，始使好萊塢驚動，而勞頓亦由此成名。柯達的出品爲吾人所熟識者計有「戰地情血」「顰鼓聲動」「四羽毛」等片，而費文麗，勞倫斯奥立佛，勞勃杜奈，神童薩菩，和他的妻子曼兒奥白朗，都爲他所發掘，現皆成爲明星。歐戰旣起，英國影片事業停頓，他決計遷往好萊塢，「月宮寳盒」便是在好萊塢續攝完成的。現在正開始另一新片的工作。</p>
<p>「月宮寳盒」爲天方夜談中著名之阿拉伯神話。片中薩菩在海岸拾得一瓶，瓶裹關禁着臘克司英格雷扮演的Djlnnf，他要求薩菩縱之出外，當他獲得自由時。立刻變一高四百餘尺的巨人，而把Ragdad城置於膝下。其中有一鏡頭薩菩立於他掌中，當拍攝時，巨手係用七噸黏土塑成模型，自肘至指尖，計長四十餘尺。</p>
<p>在「月宮寳盒」中獲得好評的翰吉士丁，生得非常英俊，且爲及格的飛行員。當該片拍完，遄返倫教故里時，洛杉磯的墨西哥女郞合送小余牌一塊，爲之懸掛項間，表示祝頌他旅途無恙，及將來在空中平安。的翰在好萊塢日子不多，已成爲美麗的墨西哥女郞們的大衆情人了。</p>
<p>瓊狄波麗之父爲喜劇名家，她自幼即有志獻身銀幕，然轉輾小公司中，無藉藉名：後應演員考試，而爲亞力山大柯達所賞識，擢爲「四羽毛」女主角，果然優伶世家，不產凡女，演披固可觀，她的姿容爲彩色所襯托，更美艷動人。此次「月宮寳盒」的成績，較「四羽毛」更爲優異。當初投考之時，她並不說起她父親的大名，自後始爲人知，可見小女兒有所自恃，益顯出她的才藝不凡</p>
<p>「月宮寳盒」中有計多鏡頭的拍攝是煞費心力的，類如飛馬行空；巨人從瓶裹出來：孩子變犬，犬再變爲孩子等，配色設計者文生柯達和攝影師喬其潘立納在這方面曾盡其最大的努力。此片的成本爲二百萬美金，合華幣三千六百萬元，則不免有誇大之嫌。</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Fifth Session of the National Political Council: Abolish the System of Paying Fees to Defer Military Service; Provincial Budgets Should First Be Submitted to the Provincial Provisional Councils for Review; Prohibit Local Issuance of Public Bonds After Review and Approval</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 5th – The fifth day of the first session of the Second National Political Council, also the first day for discussing proposals, began at 8:00 AM. Various review committees started examining the proposals. All proposals that had been reviewed were presented for discussion at the fifth session at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. As the bell rang three times, the councilors arrived one after another, and the meeting was declared open. A total of 169 councilors, including Wang Xiaolai and Wang Guanying, attended, along with more than 40 heads of various agencies and Secretary-General Wang Shijie. Chairman Wu Yifang presided. After the formal opening, the minutes of the fourth meeting were read. The Secretariat reported on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' responses to nine inquiries from the councilors. Then, the discussion of proposals began. The most debated was the government's proposal to determine whether the system of paying fees to defer military service in various provinces should continue or be changed to collecting fees for exemption certificates. Many councilors spoke unanimously, stating that the system of paying fees to defer military service violated the principle of equality in military service and should be abolished. This was approved by the assembly. As there were still many points to study regarding the collection of fees for exemption certificates, the decision was reserved for the next general meeting. Subsequently, more than a dozen proposals were passed, including the proposal by Councilor Jiang Weiyi and 27 others to define the powers of county councils, and the proposal by Councilor Chu Fucheng and 35 others that each province's annual budget should first be submitted to the provincial provisional councils for review. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued to discuss the proposal by Councilor Zhou Dewei and 30 others to prohibit local issuance of public bonds and unify the issuance of banknotes.

<p>Tokyo – Semi-official sources from South China report that the Japanese blockade of China is becoming increasingly tense today, as the Japanese suddenly began blockading a 240-mile coastline from a certain point west of Macau to the vicinity of Tokyo Bay on Monday. This blockade has been completed today. The Japanese source said that the blockade of this area is sufficient to cut off the only remaining route for Chongqing to transport military supplies, thereby completing Japan's extensive blockade of China. Japan's occupation of this coastline from Beihai to Guanghai will cut off the transport of military equipment through this area. Japanese vehicles landed in a bay in Tokyo Bay on Monday morning and completely occupied the Beihai area, expanding its occupied area to include the Yellow Sea in order to prevent the transport of military supplies to Chongqing. The Japanese communication in Guangzhou said that the Japanese army's actions constitute one of the largest records of world war, as the area of operation includes a 240-mile coastline. The important places occupied by the Japanese army in this area include Guanghai, Yangjiang, Dianbai, Shuidong, and the Leizhou Peninsula. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Changes in Soviet-German Relations</h3>
<p>The first reaction after the German troops entered Bulgaria was the Soviet Union's sudden abandonment of its year-long attempt to tactfully deal with Germany. It broke its attitude of observing and changing with the situation, which had lasted for some time, and implied its criticism of Germany with condemnation of Bulgaria. This action, when the German offensive in the Balkans has become inevitable, is rather too late. Therefore, it is difficult to say what practical effect it can have on the crisis in Southeastern Europe. However, anyone can appreciate its significance. Apart from being able to dispel some doubts, if the relevant countries can quickly seize this opportunity and use it sincerely, the international situation can start a new stage from now on.</p>
<p>When the Turkish-Bulgarian Non-Aggression Pact was first concluded, it was generally speculated that it was the result of Soviet manipulation behind the scenes. When the Bulgarian authorities turned sharply and embraced the Axis, allowing German troops to enter Bulgaria, many suspected that the Soviet Union had condoned it. Therefore, yesterday's Soviet statement not only proved that the Soviet Union's tolerance for Germany and Bulgaria's recent actions has exceeded the limit, but also that its statement of not participating in the Turkish-Bulgarian negotiations can be trusted as true. The Soviet Union's concern for the Balkans and the Nazis' coveting of the Balkans are universally known, and they know each other very well. This time, they could not find a way to compromise in advance, which exposed the differences in interests and opinions between the two sides. It can be seen that the Soviet Union has its own firm and independent position and does not necessarily support the Nazis in order to be happy to see the killing of imperialist countries. At the same time, there is more reason to believe that the Soviet Union will not only make a statement to Bulgaria, but there must be some practical steps to coordinate with this statement, and this will inevitably expand in direct proportion to the German advantage and victory in the Balkans.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this situation should be regarded as a "careless mistake" by Hitler. Generally speaking, Hitler and other invaders have always been best at seeking the suspicions and contradictions between the Soviet Union and democratic countries to achieve their aggressive attempts. The Far East Incident in 1931 and the European War in 1939 were both like this. Some conservatives in democratic countries have deep-seated prejudices against the Soviet Union in terms of ideology and system, which almost make the necessary political and military cooperation between the two sides impossible. Therefore, it further stimulates the Kremlin's psychology of fearing external threats and raises its sentiment of neutrality and self-preservation. The Soviet Union's approach to the Nazis was not so much voluntary as it was caused by the prejudices of democratic countries against the Soviet Union at that time. Therefore, although there is a brand-new non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, they constantly reveal their mutual fear in their expressions. It can be seen that this relationship has always been developing under unnatural circumstances, and it is most obvious after the establishment of the Tripartite Pact. Although the British and American authorities saw the possibility and necessity of winning over the Soviet Union, they never resolutely and actively engaged in it. Judging from the style they adopted, it was not seen that there was any progress compared to the mutual assistance negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the spring and summer of 1939. The British Cripps' mission to the Soviet Union and the proposal to conclude a British-Soviet agreement, and the American president's lifting of the moral embargo on the Soviet Union, were all gratifying phenomena, but they were trapped in some resistance and prejudices and could not be followed up with further expressions. At the same time, there are also views that equate the Soviet Union with the Nazis, Italy, and Japan, and criticisms that the Soviet Union uses American goods to supply Germany have filled the British and American forums. Not only did they fail to make a decisive decision like the Nazi authorities had done with the Soviet Union in the past, but they were not even as eager and eager as the Japanese authorities hoped to adjust their relationship with the Soviet Union. By hesitating in this way, if they want to defeat the Axis and stop the tragic invasion of the Pacific, although it is not impossible, it will inevitably take twice the effort. Fortunately, the Soviet Union has its own firm and unswerving position, and there are some fundamental and irreconcilable contradictions between it and the Axis countries. If it were really like what some British and American people have pointed out, and it were completely in cahoots with the Axis countries, then it is difficult to imagine what the international situation would be like at this time.</p>
<p>The divergence of opinion between the Soviet Union and Germany cannot be hastily regarded as an approach to democratic countries. But in terms of opposing the development of Nazi military power towards the Balkans and the Black Sea, its position is consistent with that of democratic countries. The statement made by Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, to Welles on the 2nd of this month, guaranteeing that the American goods transported to the Soviet Union would be used by the Soviet Union itself, shows that the Soviet Union does not worry about causing the Nazis' resentment in order to obtain the necessary materials from the United States. These situations should be regarded as important factors in creating the future international prospects. On the other hand, the Nazi authorities ignored the Soviet Union's concern for the Balkans, especially for Bulgaria, and recklessly included Bulgaria, probably because it imagined that it was already a hegemon and did not care about anyone, and also because it saw the Soviet Union as a "thorough pacifist" in this war. They believe that the Nazis, in view of the dangerous situation of their partners, cannot afford to make the leisurely arrangements and choices that they consider unnecessary. The consequences of such reckless disregard cannot be predicted too early, but it is not a wise plan for the Nazis to expose their weaknesses and incur deep friction for the Balkans, which have no decisive effect on the final victory or defeat. However, this has eliminated some doubts and estrangement between democratic countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, to lay the foundation for the welfare of the vast majority of people, the above-mentioned degree of change is not enough. Regarding everything in the Pacific, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that peace in the Far East must require the eternal cooperation of China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Regarding the situation centered on Europe, some experts in the United States also believe that only the union of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can eliminate the root of the disaster. This is a thorough observation, and this is an easy truth.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Personnel Related to Debt Raising; First Subscribes to Public Bonds for 10,000 Legal Tender, 1,000 US Dollars, and 500 British Pounds</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Wartime Public Bonds Encouragement Committee, and Vice President Kong, Deputy Chairman, held a tea party at Jialing Guesthouse at 4:30 PM on the 4th to entertain personnel related to debt encouragement. Chiang Kai-shek, Vice President Kong, Honorary Captain of the Capital Encouragement Team Chiang Song Meiling, Yu Youren, Wu Jingheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Quan, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, members of the committee, and captains and deputy captains of various teams, Bai Chongxi, Cheng Qian, Wang Chonghui, Chen Lifu, Xu Shiying, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Zhongyue, Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, Yu Feipeng, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Bulei, Du Yuesheng, Chen Shuren, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Zhongxin, Wei Daoming, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Kan, Chen Xing, Zhang Daofan, Jin Baoshan, Kang Xinru, Pan Yizhi, Gu Yuxiu, Taixu Master, Peng Xuepei, Jiang Tingfu, and all the councilors, chief executives of various teams, more than 400 people attended. First, Councilor Chu Fucheng reported on the process of suggesting the launch of encouragement and debt raising, and presented three points of silent opinion. Then, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech, saying that he personally believes that purchasing public bonds is a manifestation of patriotism, and the Chinese people should follow the principle of those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength to purchase public bonds and assist the country. For the past four years, millions of soldiers have done their best to serve the country, but today I still represent the soldiers of the country to purchase 10,000 yuan of legal tender public bonds, 1,000 US dollars of public bonds, and 500 pounds of British public bonds, contributing my best effort to the country after contributing my strength. Then, Vice President Kong delivered a speech, explaining the significance of this encouragement and debt raising, and reported on the methods of launching encouragement and debt raising in the capital. Finally, guest Councilor Kuang Bingshun delivered a speech in Cantonese, saying that although there are many overseas Chinese in the Americas, they have never lagged behind in their patriotic actions. Since the war, they have successively contributed tens of millions of US dollars. Overseas Chinese are determined to fully support the supreme leader, the government, the national policy, and the Three Principles of the People. This time, I came to Chongqing to participate in the Political Council and personally saw the unity of the whole country and the rapid progress of various constructions. I am deeply moved and will report everything I have seen and heard to the overseas Chinese. (Translated into Mandarin by Wu Tiecheng), the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Finally, Huang Yanpei reported that Councilor Hu Wenhu had already subscribed to 500,000 yuan of public bonds. Yang Weiyu reported that a car business owner immediately went to the association to purchase 10,000 yuan of public bonds after seeing the news in the newspaper. Although the amount is not large, his patriotic enthusiasm is deeply moving. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Letter to Compatriots</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Generalissimo Chiang recently issued a letter to the medical profession and compatriots across the country regarding the wartime public bond fundraising campaign. The original text is as follows: To all compatriots across the country, the government, through collective efforts and wisdom, is promoting the fundraising for wartime public bonds and has established the Wartime Public Bond Fundraising Committee. According to the committee's organizational charter, the Premier of the Executive Yuan will serve as the chairman concurrently. Although I, Zhongzheng, am a commander in chief, considering the significance of the issuance of wartime public bonds and its relationship to the war effort, I will personally take charge of this responsibility amidst my busy military schedule. Now that the fundraising campaign is about to begin, I would like to solemnly explain the significance of this initiative to all my compatriots and express my sincere hopes. Our country is facing unprecedented foreign aggression, and the war effort and national reconstruction are being carried out simultaneously. Thanks to the unity of all compatriots across the country and their arduous struggle, we have now entered the fifth year of the war. The light of victory is getting closer, and the final task is becoming more arduous, requiring even greater efforts. On the government's side, to pay for military expenses, replenish military supplies, strengthen national defense, and promote economic construction, sufficient financial resources are needed to ensure comprehensive coverage. Now, following the common practice of wartime countries, we are issuing wartime public bonds to ensure that the needs of the war effort are fully met without affecting the ordinary budget. This is a necessary measure. On the people's side, when it comes to this sacred national war, everyone should go to the front line and dedicate their entire lives to the country. However, the state has specific laws and regulations for military service and taxation. The military does not necessarily need everyone to go to the battlefield. At the same time, politically and economically, not everyone should go to the battlefield. Therefore, in the course of this war of resistance, everyone is contributing and serving the country in terms of quantity and fundamental aspects. However, in terms of quality and organization, most people are naturally subject to considerable restrictions. Only by taking out savings, reducing waste, and purchasing national bonds with enthusiasm and conscience can everyone, regardless of profession, gender, or age, do so anytime, anywhere. The state has pointed out this bright path, enabling compatriots across the country to enthusiastically participate in the current national salvation movement. From the people's point of view, rather than saying that they are responding to the country's urgent needs, it is better to say that they have found the easiest and most convenient way to serve the country. Rather than saying that they have fulfilled their due obligations to the country's needs, it is better to say that they have done something that brings them peace of mind and endless joy and honor. In order to achieve great and successful results in this fundraising campaign, I have the following expectations for my compatriots across the country: (1) The war of resistance is a critical juncture for the survival of the nation, and national reconstruction is a great undertaking for the revival of the nation. To achieve this historical mission of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, we must cultivate a national awareness and habit of shouldering national responsibility through the war of resistance. In particular, we must instill this kind of thinking and action in the youth of the country, the future masters, from an early age, so that the foundation of the country can be built firmly. Promoting public bonds is one of the best training methods. Principals and faculty members of primary and secondary schools across the country should mobilize and encourage all students to promote and fundraise in various locations, reaching out to the vast countryside and less knowledgeable masses. Through the widespread and in-depth fundraising campaign, we can achieve great and sincere patriotic education effects. The so-called "establishing oneself to establish others" and "achieving oneself to achieve others" will surely be the joy of our education community. (2) Modern countries must be able to adapt to competitive survival, and the entire population must be integrated into a tight organization to form a strong force. This has become a consistent trend in countries around the world. As for the application of organization, it can only be demonstrated with concrete facts. I hope that all industries and sectors across the country will use their original social organizations to organize fundraising teams. Leaders of each social organization should take the lead in promoting this cause and use this fundraising campaign to conduct widespread training in the agile application of grassroots organizations in all aspects, so that both vertical and horizontal aspects are organically connected and active. In this way, not only will the fundraising results be significant, but it will also provide special benefits for the implementation of all government policies and undertakings in the future. (3) Whether in politics or society, the most fundamental condition for doing something that can be promoted to the fullest extent must be based on fairness. Therefore, what I hope for in this public bond campaign is, of course, the widespread participation of the people across the country, but more importantly, I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will purchase according to their economic situation and within their capabilities. Those compatriots who are struggling to make a living, if they can respond generously and do their best, even a very small amount is worthy of public praise and admiration. As for the generally wealthy compatriots, their standard of living is already better than ordinary people, or even more so because some business revenue and expenditure come from the special supply and demand relationship during the war. At this critical moment of the war, it is imperative to reflect on oneself, on the one hand, to explore the source of one's wealth, and on the other hand, to understand the relationship between the rise and fall of the country and one's own vital interests, and to recognize that purchasing public bonds is an opportunity to save the country and save oneself. One should also not wait to be persuaded, but should enthusiastically donate, and within the limits of one's ability, should generously, openly, and bravely undertake to purchase huge amounts. Only in this way can one be worthy of one's ancestors and descendants, and only you wealthy compatriots can easily create a brilliant record of this fundraising campaign, wash away our nation's cold, selfish, and shameful habits, which is not comparable to other gratuitous donations. It benefits the country and oneself. Why not do it, which achieves two things at once? (4) Compatriots from all over the world have made great contributions to the progress of the revolution in the past by donating money and manpower, which is well known to all, including women and children, and shines in history. There is no need for me to repeat it. Since the war of resistance, whenever there has been fundraising for public bonds, donations to support the army, fundraising for winter clothing, disaster relief, and even fundraising to purchase airplanes and thrift savings, any kind of money-raising activity has always been particularly enthusiastic and spontaneous. Not only has there never been a single excuse, but there has never been a single cold response. The amount of each collection has exceeded the government's expectations. When people who go abroad to fundraise return and report to me, they talk about many wealthy merchants who have ruined their families and sold their property as examples, as well as hardworking overseas Chinese who have taken out their savings earned with sweat and blood, and young overseas Chinese children who have taken out their saved snacks and pocket money. All kinds of enthusiastic situations and the letters I receive daily from overseas Chinese donating money really move and excite me. I feel that overseas Chinese are truly worthy of their motherland, and our frontline soldiers often feel greatly encouraged because of this. In this fundraising campaign, the government hopes that both domestic and foreign countries will rise up and achieve the same results. However, I am even more confident that overseas Chinese will make even more special contributions at this moment when victory is approaching, to promote a glorious history and to promote the success of the war of resistance. There is also a special significance to this public bond fundraising campaign that is different from the past, that is, the initiation of this fundraising campaign was due to the proposal of the National Political Councilors, which can be said to be a general representation of national public opinion. Therefore, the method of fundraising this time is also different from the past. All compatriots purchasing bonds are based entirely on their economic capacity and voluntary subscription as a principle. The main task of each fundraising team is to persuade and publicize, and absolutely not use the rigid method of fixed quotas. Only in this way do I hope that this fundraising can exceed the achievements of past quota-based fundraising. As for the delays and postponements that were most prone to occur in the past when raising public bonds, and the various malpractices of not thinking about the subscribers, all the regulations have been predetermined and improved one by one. All procedures should be quick and accurate. All implementation methods have been described in detail in various printed materials. I hope that the compatriots who are responsible for fundraising will pay serious attention, and the compatriots from all walks of life who respond to the fundraising will contribute enthusiastically. Starting from this time, let us establish a good example of raising national debt. The types of public bonds being raised this time are the Military Needs Public Bonds of the 29th year of the Republic of China, amounting to 120 million national currency, and the Construction Fund Public Bonds, amounting to £10 million and US$50 million, all for the urgent needs of the great cause of the war. This number may seem huge at first glance, but our compatriots must know that Japan's total issuance of public bonds after the war has reached more than 200 million yuan, with an average burden of 300 yuan per person. Since the beginning of the war, our country has only issued 40 million yuan to this point, with an average of less than 10 yuan per person. I, Zhongzheng, entrusted by my compatriots across the country, lead the military and civilians in a national war of life and death with the Japanese, and always have the confidence in final victory, because we can contribute our strength, our money, and the indomitable national spirit of a united people. In the past forty-four months, this great national spirit has been fully demonstrated. I hope that these two types of debts can be fully raised in a very short period of time, giving the frontline soldiers a great encouragement, giving international public opinion a good impression, and also giving the Japanese and others a great spiritual blow. I firmly believe that our concentrated will and the concentration of our steel-like strength will surely achieve the final victory in the shortest possible time. Chiang Kai-shek, March 30th year of the Republic of China. (5th dispatch)</p>

He said that Japan is currently implementing a "policy of unlimited expansion in Oceania." O'Reilly said that rumors that President Roosevelt would form another cabinet group to control arms aid, etc., are all foolish and confusing. The Senate's debate on amending the law may begin tonight. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. and Mexico Discuss Joint Defense Against Aggression, Detailed Study of Implementation Methods Underway.  Vinson Plans to Request Increase in Naval Personnel.</h3>
<p>Washington - The Department of State announced that the U.S. and Mexico are discussing a plan to establish a joint defense against aggression. Mexico has instructed its military attachés in Washington, D.C., to consult with experts appointed by the U.S. government to discuss various plans for mutual assistance in the event of aggression against either country. The Department of State statement continued that the representatives of the two countries will study the implementation of cooperation in detail during the ongoing talks, and must respect each other's national sovereignty. These talks are being held on the basis of the Western Hemisphere Defense Agreement decided at the Second Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas last July. The U.S. and Mexico have exchanged views with each other to adjust the conduct of joint defense. It is generally believed that if the two countries reach an agreement, it will be sufficient to support the defense mechanism of the continent. Because if the U.S. and Mexico can cooperate effectively, the countries of North America can have two long lines of defense, one in the Atlantic, from Trinidad to the northern border of Canada, and one in the Pacific, from Tapachula through Mexico to Alaska.

The same sources stated that with the anticipated severance of British-Bulgarian relations, there is a possibility of British and German aircraft clashing in the Black Sea.

(Haitong dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London - Turkish radio broadcast last night that the German occupation of Bulgaria cannot affect the final issue or change the direction of events. The actions of the Axis powers in the Balkans confirm that the Axis powers dare not directly attack Britain. The Axis powers may attempt to attack Britain at a heavy sacrifice, but whether they can succeed is highly doubted even by Axis members themselves. Therefore, if the Axis powers were confident of winning an attack on Britain, they would not have moved the location of military operations to another battlefield. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Ankara - According to news here yesterday, Hitler's official letter to the Turkish President allows Turkey to recover the Syrian İskenderun region lost in the last World War.

<h3>Solemn Soviet Declaration, Cracks Exposed in German-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>London - Moscow Radio reiterated the Soviet government's declaration in Bulgarian last night, informing them that the Soviet Union cannot support its attitude towards Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The conflict in German-Soviet opinion caused by the German army's entry into Bulgaria was clearly expressed here yesterday. German informed sources criticized the Soviet note to the Bulgarian government, saying that Germany could not agree with the Soviet view that the German army's advance into Bulgaria would inevitably drag Bulgaria into the war. The sources also stated, "After Germany occupied Bulgaria, in principle, Bulgaria will not become a place of war." (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Ankara - The Soviet Union's declaration regarding the German military's occupation of Bulgaria has deeply shocked Turkish people and has become the main topic of conversation in diplomatic circles. It is considered the first formal expression of the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with German actions since August 1939. It is said that the center of Soviet policy is to maintain neutrality, and Bulgaria's actions this time bring the war closer to the Soviet border and make it more difficult to maintain its neutral policy. Moreover, Soviet officials cannot remain indifferent to Germany becoming a Black Sea power. It is generally estimated that about 80% of the Bulgarian people are pro-Soviet. Germany had previously claimed that the Soviet Union supported its occupation, but it is now known that this is not the case. The impact of this Soviet declaration on Yugoslavia will be most important, and it seems likely to strengthen Yugoslavia's position. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia, Unable to Bear German Pressure, Will Join the Axis</h3>
<p>Vichy - Observers here say that based on recent news from the capitals of Yugoslavia and Turkey, Britain seems to no longer intend to put pressure on Yugoslavia to prevent it from joining the Tripartite Pact. British envoy to Yugoslavia, Mr. Campbell, rushed to Athens yesterday to talk with Eden, proving that Eden has no intention of going to Yugoslavia. At the same time, the British Consulate General in the capital of Yugoslavia has notified expatriates to prepare to evacuate at any time. Although diplomatic circles here believe that Yugoslavia's joining the alliance is certain, they believe it may not happen immediately. Because Yugoslavia is currently in a special position in the Balkan situation and can use this position to mediate between Italy and Greece. If Yugoslavia wants to mediate, it must do so before joining the alliance, so as not to be firmly rejected by Greece. Otherwise, it is difficult to say. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to news from the French official news agency, the British Consul in the capital of Yugoslavia recently informed British expatriates residing in Yugoslavia, advising those who are not tied down by important matters to leave the country as soon as possible. Most of the female staff of the British Embassy and Consulates in the capital of Yugoslavia and the families of embassy staff have prepared to leave. British envoy to Yugoslavia Sir Campbell, who went to Athens to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden, returned to his post yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

Greece diverted a portion of its resistant troops to the Thracian border, while Turkey concentrated its elite detachments in Thrace on the Turkish border. As military preparations were accelerated, it was reported that Turkish Radio strongly warned Yugoslavia, saying that if Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers, Yugoslavia would share the same fate as Bulgaria. It is reported that Turkish Radio said, "It is better for you to die than to join the Axis powers." It is known here that Turkey has turned both sides of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus into military camps. It is reported that all Turkish naval reserves have been called up for service.

<h3>Germany Tries to Use Influence to Force Italy and Greece to Make Peace; Italian Military Suffers惨重 Defeats and Still Pretends</h3>
<p>Berlin - Yesterday, Berlin gave foreign journalists an official statement on Germany's attitude towards Greece, saying that diplomatic relations between Berlin and Athens still exist as before, but the general relations between the two countries cannot be said to be good, because Greece has made itself subject to British interests. German government officials said yesterday that Germany obtained evidence of all British schemes in Southeastern Europe and sent German troops to Bulgaria to protect the country and curb British schemes. German troops are undertaking this task and must be adequately equipped, but the number of people and equipment do not exceed the scope required for this task. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Germany Adopts New Strategy Against Britain; Uses Aircraft and Submarines to Disrupt Maritime Transport</h3>
<p>London - Aviation observers here said today that Germany may have prepared to use the main force of its air force to assist the submarine blockade, concentrating various forces in the coming months to starve Britain.

<h3>King Carol Flees Spain; Whereabouts Unusually Mysterious</h3>
<p>Madrid - The details of Romanian King Carol II's escape from Spain the night before last are quite mysterious. It is said that the night before last, Mr. Carol and Ms. Lupescu took an American-made Lincoln car for a drive. At first, they drove towards Badajoz, but not far from that place, they suddenly turned south and sped towards the Los Rosales border (the border between Spain and Portugal). There, a car used by a Polish diplomat was parked, seemingly waiting. As soon as the car approached, Mr. Carol and Ms. Lupescu hurriedly jumped out of their car, rushed into the waiting car, and drove across the Spanish border into Portugal. Afterwards, the Spanish police searched for Mr. Carol's entourage, but they were nowhere to be found. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Naval Status of World Powers</h3>
<p>London - The 1940 Jane's Fighting Ships yearbook contains a record of the major powers' naval expansion, with the United States being the most significant, and a record of the destruction of most of the Italian navy. It also estimates that there are currently 40 battleships under construction worldwide. Although the yearbook encountered wartime censorship and difficulties in keeping secrets, it still contains new drawings of the most powerful British warship in the world, the "King George V," (British Ambassador to the United States Halifax traveled to the United States on this ship) and details of the German new battleships "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz" and the various ships being built by the United States, Japan, and Italy. The war loss section of the yearbook details the numbers of naval losses of the belligerent countries since 1919. The first page publishes a bird's-eye view of the Italian fleet at Taranto, which was bombed by British aircraft last November. The British side has suffered relatively light losses in large ships, but the most losses were in small ships, totaling more than 100 ships, some of which have disappeared without a trace. As of the time the yearbook was compiled, Britain had also lost 36 destroyers and 23 submarines. The German navy has suffered repeated losses, leaving only one pocket battleship, several cruisers, and 13 destroyers. Of the 70 submarines used by the German side at the beginning of the war, only a few are still in service today. In addition to the damage suffered at Taranto, the Italian side has also lost one cruiser, seven destroyers, and at least 30 submarines. All of the new battleships currently being built by various countries, except for Japan's four pocket battleships, all weigh at least 35,000 tons. There are at least 20 battleships weighing over 40,000 tons, including the British four Lion-class battleships. The first two are scheduled to be built in 1943. The United States is currently building or has ordered a total of 17 battleships, some of which may displace as much as 52,000 tons. The United States' shipbuilding program also includes 12 aircraft carriers, 54 cruisers, 200 destroyers, and 80 submarines. The number of submarines that Germany has begun to build is impossible to guess. There is no reliable basis for the United States' estimate that the German side is building 300 submarines, but it is widely believed that this number is quite reasonable. According to unconfirmed news, the battleships currently being built by the German side may include the "Gross Friedrich" and "Hindenburg." As for the claim that the battleships "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz" have been completed and are in service, it cannot be easily believed. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Rice - Estimated that 1.8 Million Bags of Imported Rice Have Arrived in the City, All Frozen and Hidden by Major Hoarders, Plunging the Public's Life into Despair - Those Responsible Cannot Evade Their Guilt -</h3>
<p>With the abnormal behavior of imported rice, unscrupulous merchants and giant hoarders are even more肆无忌惮。 Yesterday, the market was still沉寂。 The点缀 者 were 洋元 rice and 碎元 rice etc. to somewhat meet the market needs. The black market 暗盘 continued to add 2-3 yuan, No. 2 Saigon现 rice reached 90 yuan, 限价貼价 for No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon both required 800-900 yuan to 1000 yuan. For 小纹 rice, due to competition between new囤 and domestic customers, 限价貼价 reached a huge 1200-1300 yuan. Such a situation is quite frightening. The entire day's transactions were 6000-7000 bags, 回笼 was over 1000 tons, and there were rumors of暗盘外場 with 小绞 at 1600 yuan and No. 1 Saigon at 1500-1600 yuan. Multiple new transactions were being negotiated, and there were rumors that some had already been agreed, but generally, people wanted to盡其操縱。 The market did not make any official announcements. Based on the market's公米, there were still 700-800 thousand stored in warehouses, while the privately stored, uninvestigated number was incredibly large. The estimated存米 at the end of last year was over 1.4 million bags. In January and February of this year, over 1 million bags arrived, totaling over 2.4 million bags. Even if杜米货物 were ignored, and after deducting 600 thousand bags of citywide米 consumption as the maximum for two months, the city should still have over 1.8 million bags of imported rice. Excluding over 700 thousand公米 in warehouses, the remaining over 1 million bags are all hidden in non-public places by太囤戶. These 大囤戶 are all wealthy and powerful, allowing them to沆瀣一氣 and安若泰山. It is heard that when 大囤戶 order rice, it is not unusual to order several thousand bags or hundreds of tons. 洋行华行 therefore贪图. They clearly know that investigating存米, reporting囤積,筹办公储, and调节米价 will推委with not being in范围内, further長 奸商之氣燄. Therefore, the fact that Shanghai's民食 are severely threatened by囤戶 today is also有意. It is also heard that 400-500 thousand bags of 定米货物 will arrive soon, which is significantly different from the situation two years ago when the warehouses were empty. Why is there such a strange phenomenon, while the大戶 freeze their low-priced存米 and do not dispose of it? The public's lives are being sacrificed for the benefit of a few 大囤戶.</p>
<p>Another shipment of imported rice has arrived at the port. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Taoyuan轮 arrived from Hong Kong with 7459 bags, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession yesterday morning to unload.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the report in yesterday's newspaper that Jardine Matheson's Yusheng轮 arrived on the 3rd from Hong Kong with 4404 bags, which was the first shipment of imported rice for the month, it has now been discovered that there was another ship that arrived in Shanghai before the Yusheng轮. This was the Norwegian Huarlun 洋行's Dapu轮, which arrived on the 2nd of this month, directly from Rangoon with 21,500 bags, docking at the Pujiang鸿升码头. The unloading has now been completed, and it is heard that the ship will continue to go to Rangoon in the coming days to transport rice to Shanghai. (祖)</p>
<p>The surge in国米 has diminished. Yesterday, with the source still scarce and sales brisk, continuing飞涨 by a huge 3-4 yuan. The prices are as follows: Kunshan斛见白粳 at 116 yuan, Chang帮白粳 at 118 yuan, Qing角薄稻斛见 at 114-111 yuan,原包 at 118 yuan, 117 yuan. The supply of glutinous rice on the market is scarce, and the demand is still high, so the selling price also continued to rise by 2-3 yuan. The prices are: Hong Kong白元 at 97-95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Over 200,000 Bags of Flour Arrive; Market Eases in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Flour - Yesterday's market was tight first, then weak. When the market opened in the morning, most customers and囤 were influenced by the rumors of the situation, ignoring the facts and blindly吸. 本街方面, even though the supply of华厂 平卖 flour had not yet been decided, they did not mind the high price and bought in the market. Therefore, 花鸟钟楼脾澳 flour, when the market opened, immediately rose from 29 yuan to 29.4 yuan. Jinlong牌坎 flour also rose from 28 yuan to 28.3 yuan, and Huangniu牌 was at 28.15 yuan. However, the situation gradually eased in the afternoon because the new arrival of洋粉 had been confirmed. There were 180,000 bags of Jinlong牌, and tens of thousands of bags each of Huangniu脾 and Jardine Matheson's red and blue字高挡粉. The arrival of goods totaled over 200,000 bags. With the surge in定粉 and the通劃 in產价, people could not help but become aware. Therefore, those who made a profit from囤购 thought of倾吐. The market's end was weaker than its beginning. 花鸟牌 returned to 29 yuan, and other brands also returned to 2-3角 from their highest point.</p>
<p>Another report: 1,000 bags of洋粉 arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Taoyuan轮 arrived at the port yesterday. In addition to a large batch of imported rice from Hong Kong, there were also 1,000 bags of flour, which was Australian produce, transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. This flour is used by bread factories.</p>
<p>Wheat - Yesterday's market remained坚硬. A ship of Fuxin廠's 定麦 was still being sorted due to潮. Fufeng廠 had no洋麦 assistance and could not製粉供. Therefore, with the lack of raw materials, the market was almost always俏. There were only喊盘 of国产杜麦, with no actual transactions.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Oil is Strongest</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for杂粮油饼 was fluctuating, with行情 rising and falling suddenly. The overall situation was chaotic because of this. Yellow beans were stable, corn fell by半元, while red beans continued to tighten by 3-4角. Bean cakes were initially stable, then rose because the issue of 期货 settlement price had not been clearly resolved. It was heard that some空头 wanted to按級了手續 at 3-4-5角, but the多头 were not satisfied, so they remained擯持. Peanut oil suddenly rose sharply by 3-4 yuan because the prices in产地 were昂 and Qingdao帮 were吸. The rise and fall of bean oil depended on Dalian oil. Therefore, at the beginning of the morning, it uniformly fell with the連油. At its lowest point, Dalian oil was比上日市 off by over 2 yuan, but in the afternoon, new囤戶拖進 when prices were low, and the market price slowly rose, eventually exceeding the previous day's price by half a yuan. The other prices also followed suit and rose by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Imports of miscellaneous grains: On the 5th, 1000 cans of raw oil came from Tianjin, and 1875 bags of soybeans came from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Offset</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listing, showed no change. The off-market exchange rates between British and American currencies did not have significant movement. Although there was some instability, trading volume decreased. Both foreign banks had supply and demand, keeping the market stable. The majority of US dollar transactions were at 5.5 yuan. Near noon, rumors of easing in the Far East situation caused some restlessness, and some speculators made purchases. However, this was offset by the supply and sales of British and American banks. By closing, the market remained stable. The spot British pound was trading at 3/16 375, and the US dollar at 5.5 yuan. Compared with the previous day's prices, there was no significant change.

<h3>The Secret of Preserving Wealth (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Saint Ke Qiong</p>
<p>(I) Saving National Construction Savings</p>
<p>The saving national construction savings are handled by the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau under the orders of the National Government. The security guarantee for this type of savings is threefold. The first stipulation is that this savings can only be invested in land reclamation, water conservancy, development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, construction of factories, construction of railways, development of shipping, mining of minerals, etc. The stocks and bonds invested in this type of production project are used as the first guarantee preparation for savings. The second regulation stipulates that the accounting of this savings is independent, and the profit and loss situation is not mixed with the profit and loss of the general business of each bank. The third regulation stipulates that in addition to being directly responsible to depositors by each bank, the government guarantees the safety of principal and interest. Therefore, from the point of view of safety, saving national construction savings can be said to be the most reliable.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of depositors, it is divided into two types, A and B: Type A is "current deposit fixed withdrawal", which can be added to at any time after deposit, and the interest is compounded every six months. Type B is divided into four types: "Lump Sum Deposit and Lump Sum Payment", "Zero Deposit and Lump Sum Payment", "Lump Sum Deposit and Zero Payment", and "Deposit and Interest Withdrawal". The term is from three to ten years, and the interest rate is from 7.5% to 10% per week.</p>
<p>The regulations on saving national construction savings were announced by the National Government on November 29, 1938. Two important provisions are excerpted below: Article 7 "Saving national construction savings may be stored in foreign currency, and the principal and interest will still be paid in foreign currency after maturity. Those stored in cash and silver will be added with handling fees in accordance with the Supplementary Measures for Exchange of Legal Tender by the Ministry of Finance and the Measures for Exchange of Legal Tender by Gold, and included in the principal for calculation." Article 8 "Savings national construction savings passbook may be used as a substitute when a security deposit must be paid for official business."</p>
<p>(II) Saving National Construction Savings Bonds</p>
<p>Following the savings national construction savings, the National Government opened a savings bond. On September 12, 1939, the National Government announced the savings national construction savings regulations, and on December 14 of the same year, the Ministry of Finance announced the implementation rules of the savings national construction savings bond regulations. The savings construction savings bond is a type of savings construction savings, and its investment scope restrictions and safety guarantees are the same. The bonds are divided into two types, A and B. Type A bonds are registered and can be reported lost and reissued, but small bonds of 500 yuan or less do not have to be named for issuance. The funds can be withdrawn with the bond after six months of deposit. Type B bonds are unregistered and can be freely transferred or given away. The interest is deducted first when purchasing the bond. A savings bond with a higher face value can be purchased with less money than the face value of the bond. When it expires, legal tender can be collected based on the face value of the bond, so the longer the term, the less the amount of money required to purchase the bond.</p>
<p>Both Type A and Type B savings bonds are divided into seven types: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. The term is from six months to ten years. The interest rate was originally set at 6% to 8.5%. The meeting of the four joint general management directors on September 5, 1940, decided to increase the interest rate of various savings deposits. It is stipulated in the method: Type A bonds increase the bonus to full 8% after six months of deposit, increase the bonus to full 1.1% after five years of deposit, and increase the bonus to full 1.2% after ten years of deposit; Type B bonds give another bonus after one year or more to full interest rate of 1%, 1.05% for two to four years, 1.1% for five to seven years, 1.15% for eight to nine years, and 1.2% for ten years.</p>
<p>Saving national construction savings bonds can also be used as security deposits for official business, and can also be used as guarantee preparations for local banks to issue auxiliary currency bonds. The bondholder can also use it for various purposes during the savings period, and can still earn interest at the same time. All famous commercial banks in China can purchase it on behalf, and people in the war zone can also use the communication method to purchase it, so it is convenient to purchase. Moreover, the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank jointly issue savings bonds, and the Farmers Bank of China mutually exchanges savings bonds, so it not only strengthens the credit of savings bonds, but also is very convenient for bond purchasers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board Discusses Reducing Electricity Supply New Applications for Electricity Installation No Longer Accepted The Bureau Will Assist in Obtaining Coal Jin</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources yesterday, the Committee for the Study of Electricity Supply Issues organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council has submitted a proposal after two weeks of research, advocating for an immediate reduction of 30% in the electricity supply. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting at 4:30 yesterday afternoon, and the proposal was submitted for discussion and a resolution has been made, but the method was not announced yesterday. According to sources with sensitive information, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will accept whatever resolution the Shanghai Municipal Council makes. Shanghai residents have expressed acceptance of the decision made by the Shanghai Municipal Council not to accept new applications for motor electricity, as this measure is a good way to help the Electric Power Company solve the problem of fuel shortage, and it is also beneficial to existing users.</p>
<p>New Applicants Will Not Be Supplied</p>
<p>It is reported that the subcommittee suggested that the reduction of electricity should be implemented gradually, and the Municipal Council should assist the Electric Power Company in obtaining vessels to transport the necessary coal and fuel to Shanghai. The first step for the Municipal Council to assist the Electric Power Company in dealing with the current situation is to announce that "Due to the shortage of fuel and the difficulty in obtaining goods, from today until another notice is issued, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will not accept any subsequent applications for electricity supply."</p>
<p>The Labor Situation is Becoming More Difficult</p>
<p>The decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council will affect the electric current services provided by the Shanghai Electric Power Company in various ways, such as not being able to add electrical equipment in private residences, and not being able to install new electrical appliances in new residences. At the same time, the industrial community in the city is paying close attention to the reduction of electricity supply. Some people expect that the reduction of electricity will make the labor situation in the city more difficult, because if the electricity is reduced, many workers in major factories will have to stop work.</p>
<p>Japanese Textile Industry Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Havas World Telecommunications Tokyo, 4th, According to the Japanese Chronicle, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has recently reduced the electricity supply to factories by 40% due to the lack of coal, and the Japanese-owned factories in Shanghai must reduce production by 50%. However, although the factories of other businesses and foreign businesses are also subject to the same restrictions, they are still able to operate at full capacity. Upon hearing the news, the Osaka Textile Association was extremely dissatisfied and held a meeting on the 20th of last month, deciding to request the government to intervene. The Secretary-General of the Association, Mr. Higashikawa, has already set off to come here to contact the government on this matter.</p>
<p>There is No Panic About Coal Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain coal leader said that the Electric Power Company's proposal to reduce electricity is not due to the imminent interruption of the coal source. The only intention is to take precautionary measures in view of the difficulty in transportation compared to the past, and to reduce unnecessary consumption. In March, 30,000 tons of Haiphong white coal will arrive in Shanghai, and the source of bituminous coal will not be lacking, so there will be no panic in the supply of coal briquettes. Shanghai's coal reserves are sufficient for the needs of March and April. The lack of transportation vessels is a fact, but the coal industry should do its utmost to ensure the continuous source of coal blocks. I hope that citizens will not compete to hoard excessively and affect the inventory. In this turbulent situation, all industries and all citizens of the isolated island should work closely together, weather the storm together, and share the difficulties. They should not take their own interests as a prerequisite. Therefore, the coal industry has done its best to prevent coal prices from rising.</p>
<h3>International Hotel No Sale News</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign newspapers reported that the International Hotel next to the Shanghai Racecourse was for sale. The reporter considered the hotel to be the first-class hotel in Shanghai, well-known overseas, and once it was sold, it would be different from the situation of ordinary hotel owners changing. Therefore, he went to various places to investigate, and the result was that there was no such thing. It is also heard that the manager of the hotel, Mr. Hertz, has sent letters to various Chinese and Western newspapers stating that the rumors are not true.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador and British Consul General Held Talks Yesterday Morning Listened to Various Reports for a Long Time All Parties Attach Great Importance to the Ambassador's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived here from Chongqing the day before yesterday (4th), he held talks with British Consul General to Shanghai George the morning of yesterday (5th) for two hours. There is no news about the talks. However, it is generally believed that the British Consul General reported to Ambassador Kerr on the recent situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Refused to Make Any Comments</p>
<p>When the Ambassador came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he politely refused to answer any questions raised by reporters, and asked the reporters to let him have some peace. He only said that he and his wife had a pleasant trip from Chongqing via Hong Kong to Shanghai. When the Duke arrived, a Japanese reporter approached him with a camera, intending to take a picture of the Duke's face. The Duke immediately covered the lens with his hand, causing laughter from the crowd in the field.</p>
<p>The Length of Stay in Shanghai is Still Undetermined</p>
<p>After Ambassador Clark Kerr arrived in Shanghai, due to environmental reasons, he did not reside in the official residence on Dunsind Road, but stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Yesterday morning, Mr. Kerr officially went to the Ambassador's Shanghai Office at No. 27, Bund to handle official business. As for the length of stay in Shanghai, rumors abound, some saying one month, some saying several weeks, but in fact, this question cannot be determined at present, and it must depend on the evolution of the situation. Yesterday, the Japanese side in Shanghai remained silent about Mr. Kerr's arrival and made no important comments. The US authorities in Shanghai were very interested in and attached importance to the British Ambassador's sudden arrival in this besieged Shanghai. As for the Ambassador's wife, she did not come here from Chongqing this time. Because she received news that Mr. Kerr was coming to Shanghai beforehand, she went to Hong Kong several weeks ago to welcome him and came to Shanghai on the same ship. Mrs. Kerr is very active among the British women's groups in this port.</p>
<h3>Rice and Coal Prices Soar Again: City in Shock; Amidst Turbulent Times, Public Security is Paramount; Emergency Measures to Stabilize Prices Can Wait No Longer</h3>
<p>Since the Rice Evaluation Committee sent a delegation to meet with Mr. H.G. Henderson, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, requesting guidance on measures to stabilize rice prices, the situation in the market yesterday did not stabilize as a result. It remained as chaotic as before, and various black market rice surcharges became even more rampant. The surcharge for every hundred bags of "Little Twist" rice reached 1,600 yuan. Even Saigon No. 2 rice saw its surcharge jump by another three to four yuan from the previous day, and the price of domestic rice soared even more uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Rice Market Chaos Escalates</p>
<p>The authorities believe that such a chaotic rice market is not beneficial to society, especially since coal supplies are already scarce. The Shanghai Municipal Council has approved the power company's reduction of electricity supply, and Chinese and foreign factories have implemented shorter work hours. At a time when the general public is feeling severe pressure in their lives, the soaring price of rice is even more likely to cause various labor-management disputes. Therefore, in addition to first ordering the officers stationed in the market to earnestly investigate and do their best to clear the sources of domestic rice, a complete remedy may be decided within days. According to investigations, more than one million bags of rice arrived in January and February, which, according to estimates, should be more than sufficient. Therefore, this sudden price surge is definitely not due to supply difficulties or panic, but rather a clear case of intentional monopolization and hoarding. It is truly regrettable that the members of the Rice Merchants Association are shirking their responsibilities amidst such serious public concern over food, using the excuse that they are powerless to do anything. It is said that the members of the Rice Merchants Association are also hoarding large quantities of rice, intending to sell them at high prices, which is truly something that the four million residents of the city deeply resent.</p>
<p>Public Granary Rice Flour and Wheat Arrive</p>
<p>The Public Granary Rice Committee held a procurement group meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council at 2:00 PM yesterday. It was reported that as of today, the total amount of public granary rice funds actually received was 6,185,750 yuan. It was resolved to immediately order 80,000 bags of "Little Twist" rice from Yangon. The remaining rice funds that have been pledged but not yet paid will continue to be vigorously collected, and more orders will be placed successively. Furthermore, the Tang Chao Si ship, chartered by the committee, arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday afternoon, carrying a large consignment of 6,000 tons of flour and 5,000 tons of wheat. The ship is currently docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou, and the cargo is being unloaded.</p>
<p>Retail Price of Coal Briquettes Rises Again</p>
<p>When the coal market opened yesterday, it initially showed a strong trend, and public sentiment was very firm. Rumors were rampant, and coal speculators became even more active. There were no large transactions of coal. However, due to manipulation, coal powder needed to make coal briquettes caused widespread anxiety, and people hoarded it, refusing to let go of it easily. The market price of coal briquettes was raised by ten yuan per ton yesterday, and the retail price rose to over nine yuan per picul (one hundred market catties).</p>
<h3>Funeral of Warden Zhao Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhao Xinyu, the former Warden of the Shanghai Second Special District Prison and concurrently Director of the Detention Center, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing in February of the 29th year of the Republic (1940).

Mr. Xu's car was also stolen and has not been found. Rumors that the abductors carried out the abduction in a car with license plate Zhao Hui 2015 could not be confirmed yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Police Department: A. Recurring Expenditure Items: The draft budget for the Police Department's various recurring expenses for this year lists 24,267,020 yuan. After revision, it has been changed to 36,997,640 yuan, an increase of 19,713,760 yuan compared to the previous year.

Temporary Expenditure Items: Temporary expenses are divided into two categories as usual: (A) those already approved or deemed necessary by the Board of Directors; (B) those that should not be spent this year considering the current financial situation of the Bureau.

<h3>Fuxing Ship Loads Beans to Shanghai, All Confiscated</h3>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese Navy controlled all the coastal ports of China. Loading and unloading of cargo had to be approved with a permit and a moving permit in advance, otherwise it would be confiscated. It is learned that the Fuxing ship of the Xixing Company, now flying the "Manzhou" flag and represented by Taichangxiang, was sailing on the North Sea line. It returned to Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday (the 3rd), carrying a large batch of beans, including 755 bags of soybeans, 620 bags of mung beans, and 500 bags of black beans, totaling 1,875 bags. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and was preparing to unload when the Japanese side discovered that the beans were loaded in Tianjin without a permit and could not obtain a moving permit upon arrival in Shanghai. Therefore, they were monitored and unloading was prohibited. Although the Hakka tried to intercede, it was ineffective. The Japanese Naval Police ordered the ship to sail to the Ningshao Wharf at the 16th Pier (which has now been converted into a Japanese Naval warehouse, and the former Dada Wharf has also been incorporated), and unload into the warehouse there.</p>
<p>Confiscated: The ship was originally to be punished, but because it was flying the "Manzhou" flag, the Japanese side gave it leniency and did not pursue the matter further. To avoid trouble, it was allowed to remain docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. The beans were transferred to a Japanese ship and transported to the Japanese Naval warehouse (i.e., Ningshao Wharf) in the Nanshi district to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Murder Occurs in Oriental Hotel; Both Sides Exchange Fire, Firing Over Ten Shots; Wounded Man and Accomplices Flee Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At 7:45 PM last night, a bizarre murder occurred in room 520 of the Oriental Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road in the International Settlement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Four Men With Guns Break In</p>
<p>A man, about 20 years old, speaking with a Ningbo accent, rented room 530 of the Oriental Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road a month ago as a place to meet and talk. His dealings were quite complex. At 7:45 PM last night, guests were gathered in the room, and four of them were playing mahjong. As they were playing enthusiastically, four men in Chinese clothing, carrying pistols, suddenly broke in and immediately drew their guns and opened fire on the four men.</p>
<p>One Man Shot and Wounded Flees</p>
<p>Upon hearing the gunshots, the people in the room scattered and hid, and were not injured. However, one of them drew his pistol and returned fire. Both sides exchanged fire over ten times, hitting one of the intruders in the abdomen. He fell to the ground on the spot, bleeding profusely. However, after the man was injured, the other three immediately helped him up, dragged him out, and hurried down the stairs. In an instant, they were gone.</p>
<p>Police Investigation Finds No Trace</p>
<p>At this time, the police had received a report and immediately sent a large number of detectives in red police cars to the scene. After surrounding the Oriental Hotel, the detectives entered the Oriental Hotel, pulled up the iron gate, and immediately investigated the room, recovering several bullet casings. After a thorough search for about two hours, there was no trace of the wounded man or the other three. At that time, the fire brigade also received a report and immediately sent an ambulance, but because the wounded man was missing, they had to return empty-handed. According to reports, the four men had left by car before the detectives arrived.</p>
<p>Blood Stains on the Stairs</p>
<p>When the reporter went to investigate, he saw fresh blood stains on the stairs from the third to the fifth floors of the Oriental Hotel. There were also blood stains in front of the room and in the long corridor. However, according to another report, this case was a robbery. The details of the shooting are still under investigation by the police.</p>

<h3>Four Presidential Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After Another; Pre-booked Cabins Crowded; President Pierce Postponed to Arrive in Port on the 9th; About 200 American Citizens Evacuate by Ship</h3>
<p>The President Pierce of the American President Lines, returning from Manila, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong on the 7th. As previously reported, the company announced yesterday that the ship would be slightly delayed in Manila and Hong Kong, so the arrival date in Shanghai would be postponed to 9:00 AM on the 9th. It will still dock at pontoons 12 and 13. Passengers will take a small ferry and disembark at the Customs Wharf at 10:30 AM. It is scheduled to depart Shanghai and return to the United States at 9:15 PM on Monday, the 10th. The last ferry for sending off passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 7:30 PM on the afternoon of the same day.</p>
<p>American Citizens Leave Shanghai in Batches</p>
<p>It is heard that more than 200 American citizens from the occupied area will evacuate back to the United States on this ship. According to the company, since the American authorities issued the second evacuation advisory, the number of people pre-booking cabins has become more crowded than before. Most of them are American women and children. The President Pierce, which is scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 10th, the President Taft, which is scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 21st, and the President Cleveland, which is scheduled to depart Shanghai next month, have all had their cabins fully booked. Even most of the cabins on the President Coolidge, which is scheduled to depart Shanghai in mid-May, have already been booked. The passenger limit for each of the above ships is currently still close to 300 people, which is the same as before. However, if the situation becomes urgent, beds will be added at any time, and the capacity can be increased to 1,200 people. It is reported that on average, two presidential ships leave Shanghai every month. If each ship carries 250 American citizens who are evacuating from China, then 500 people return to the United States every month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Citizens in Singapore Continue to Evacuate; Arrive in Shanghai on the Hakone Maru; Depart for Japan Today</h3>
<p>The Japanese postal ship Hakone Maru left Colombo on February 4th and arrived in Shanghai via Bombay, Singapore, Manila, etc. at 4:00 PM on the 4th of this month. It docked at the Pudong Wharf.

According to Tomogoro Hashizume, he was transferred to serve as the deputy consul in Singapore in May of the year before last. He now believes that the situation there is urgent, so most of the passengers on the Hakone Maru this time are evacuating from Singapore back to their home country. He will also send his children to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Japan on the 6th of this month.</p>

<h3>Idling Workers Collude with Western Doctor to Scare and Defraud Employer; Reported to Police for Interrogation and Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Wu Qixian, the manager of the Huaxin Rubber Printing Factory at No. 4, Lane 6, Jingan Temple Road, dismissed three workers, Liu Bingyuan, Sun Zhaonian, and Jiang Chenjun, at the end of last year for poor performance. At the time, he gave them 350 yuan in severance pay. However, Liu and the others were unwilling to accept this and entrusted Zhu Xilin, a western doctor from Xingyeli No. 8, Lyusong Road, Avenue Edward VII, using the alias Li Guangda, to negotiate with Wu Qixian, and to invite Wu to meet at room 230 of the Jinshan Hotel on Sanma Road, in an attempt to extort 2,000 yuan, otherwise they would drag Wu to a certain country's headquarters to demand it. Wu secretly reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Li Yinmin to arrest Zhu Xilin, Liu Bingyuan, and eight others, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong presided over the third criminal court and announced the verdict: Zhu Xilin, alias Li Guangda, was sentenced to six months in prison for attempting to extort property through intimidation, and the remaining Liu Bingyuan and others were each sentenced to four months in prison. Except for the aforementioned two, all others were granted a three-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers' Confessions Examined Separately; Zhu Boquan Nearly Killed; 60,000 Yuan Already Paid, But Still Wanted to Kill Him; Two Kidnappers Repented and Secretly Released Him</h3>
<p>Zhu Boquan, the director of the reserve of the Bank of China, residing at No. 640 Haig Road, left for the China Insurance Company by private car at 10:00 AM on November 29th of last year. While passing Yidingpan Road, he was intercepted by several kidnappers who were lying in wait there. The kidnappers got into the car and drove it to the Hou Family Residence. After the Zhu family found a way to negotiate, they paid 60,000 yuan to redeem him. On the 20th of last month, Chinese detective Feng Baishun, Chinese detectives Kong Guangxiao, Pi Shaozhang, Wang Yongjun, etc. of the Putuo Police Station received a tip from an informant and arrested six kidnappers, including Zhu Chunchun, at Yuyuan Road, Hyde Road, etc. for secret investigation for ten days.</p>
<p>Guarding the Hostage, Sharing a Little Money</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they were escorted to the third criminal court of the First Special Court. Except for Tan Changfa and Huang Heshan, who were suspected of being unrelated and were released first, the remaining four defendants were prosecuted in accordance with Article 347 of the Criminal Code, etc., for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. Judge Huang Risheng presided over the court and ordered separate interrogations. First, lawyer Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, stated the case. Then, according to the confession of the first defendant, Zhu Chunchun, "I had nothing to do with this case at first. My cousin Zhu Asi invited me to see the hostage. He said that a capitalist was kidnapped and placed in the doorman's room of the Heji Construction Factory at No. 315 Daxi Road. He told me to guard him, and I could share a little money. Because I had no business, I immediately agreed."</p>
<p>60,000 Yuan Already Paid, Still Wanted to Kill Him</p>
<p>"Unexpectedly, not long after Zhu Boquan was kidnapped to No. 315, a case of Japanese and Italian soldiers being shot occurred, and the search was very strict. That night, the hostage was moved to the home of the leader, Liu Zhenguo, at the Hou Family Residence on Columbia Road. On December 2nd, the hostage's family paid 60,000 yuan in ransom. After Liu Zhenguo received it, he still wanted to kill the hostage. When I thought about it, my conscience was really a little uneasy. I discussed it with my uncle Zhu Asi and wanted to steal the hostage and escape. Zhu Boquan was grateful to me, so I accompanied Zhu Boquan to escape on the afternoon of the next day. Because Zhu Boquan wanted to repay me for saving his life, he voluntarily gave me 15,000 yuan as a reward. I used more than 9,000 yuan myself, and the rest was divided among Liu Guozhen's subordinates."</p>
<p>Renting a House Under Threat</p>
<p>According to the second defendant, Zhu Asi, "I didn't know the leader of the kidnappers, Liu Zhenguo, at all. I worked in the printing department of the Jianghai Customs Office at No. 1711 Xinzha Road. Last year, my sister's daughter was kidnapped by the kidnappers. I entrusted my colleague Shi Qixiang to contact Liu Zhenguo, and paid 1,500 yuan to redeem her. Because of this, I met Liu. Three days before November 29th, Shi Qixiang said that Liu Zhenguo wanted to rent a house to hide the hostage. I didn't agree to rent a house for him. Shi Qixiang also said that if I didn't, I would offend him (referring to Liu Zhenguo), and he would definitely instruct his subordinates to make things difficult for us. Because I was afraid, I helped him find a house in the Heji Construction Factory on Daxi Road."</p>
<p>Privately Releasing the Hostage, Nearly Shot</p>
<p>"After they kidnapped Zhu Boquan, they got the ransom and still wanted to kill the hostage. It was Zhu Chunchun and I who privately released the hostage. I heard that the hostage gave Chunchun 15,000 yuan as a reward, but I didn't know about it. It was only the day before I was arrested that I received 200 yuan as a reward. Because I saved Zhu Boquan's life, I was ordered by the leader Liu to be arrested by his subordinates, sitting on a tiger stool all night. The next day, I was escorted to the wasteland on Kaixuan Road and prepared to be shot. Fortunately, a large group of police officers passed by, and they were inconvenient to open fire. They escorted me back to the Liu leader's house in the Hou Family Residence for soft imprisonment. Later, my old mother found me, repeatedly crying and begging in front of Liu, and paid 5,800 yuan to redeem me home." After reviewing the facts in court, and after briefly interrogating the defendants Zhao Jinbo and Xu Daoju who were brought to court, the judge announced that the case would be adjourned to the morning of the 13th to summon the victim Zhu Boquan to court for further trial.</p>

<h3>Chen Linan Wins Over Zhang Xianlun (Retirement); Jingwu Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Begin Registration</h3>
<p>The organizers of the fourth Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship of the Jingwu Athletic Association held the first competition committee meeting at the association hall at 6:00 PM the other night. Those present included Liang Jintang, Chen Linsheng, Ding Du, Chuan Guiqing, Xu Duo, Li Suishen, Li Guoxian, Feng Suishen, Liu Keren, and others. First, Liang Jintang announced the purpose of the competition, followed by Chen Linsheng's report on the preparations. Then, the competition rules for this year were discussed and revised. During the meeting, Zhu Lianxiang proposed that the competition adopt a double-elimination system, which was unanimously approved. Finally, Liang Jintang, Xu Duo, and Chen Linsheng were appointed to the general affairs group; Huang Weiqing to the accounting group; Zhao Ziping to the document group; Zhu Lianxiang and Chuan Guiqing to the scheduling group; Ding Du and Li Suishen to the referee group; Feng Chanchu and Li Guoxian to the administrative group; and Yu Binqi, Liu Keren, and Lu Zhongqiu to the public relations group, to be in charge of all matters. The competition rules have been passed, and registration will begin on the 12th. The registration fee is one yuan for members and two yuan for non-members. According to the history of table tennis competitions, whether organized by teams or individuals, the adoption of a double-elimination system is a first. The use of this type of competition in this year's Jingwu Cup, although it will take longer, can avoid the blandness of a single elimination. It will not only increase the interest in the competition but also make the emergence of the champion more accurate.</p>
<h3>Great Samsung Individual Table Tennis: Fan Shi and Others Tied for First Place</h3>
<p>In order to promote the skills of its players and generate interest among its members, the Great Samsung Table Tennis Team launched the Great Samsung Cup Individual Table Tennis Championship. Mr. Wang Guiting, the general manager, obtained a large silver shield from the museum authorities. The champion's name will be engraved on the silver shield for commemoration. Last year was the first session, and the champion was Le Dezhi. This year is the second session, which opened on the 20th of last month. To date, it has been more than ten days, and the round-robin battles have all ended. Last year's champion, Le Dezhi, was very strong and had hoped to defend his title, but his performance has declined recently, and he first lost to Zhu Hongxing and then was defeated by Fan Hanqing by a score of two to three, costing him the championship, which is a pity. Currently, Shi Jiaqi and Fan Hanqing have the best record, each with ten wins and one loss, tied for first place. Who will be the champion is yet to be decided. Le Dezhi and Gu Yuqi are in third and fourth place, respectively. The fifth place is tied by Zong Qihou, Cui Wenchang, and Zhu Hongxing, each with six points, so a triangular round-robin will be held to determine the order. The finals of the cup are scheduled for mid-month, and it is planned to invite the strong Jewish team to participate in an exhibition match. It is reported that the Shen Bao Table Tennis Team has donated a banner as a prize for the cup champion. The Great Samsung Team considers this a great honor, so it sent a letter of thanks. Their full record is listed below:</p>
<p>Name Wins-Losses Name Wins-Losses</p>
<p>Fan Hanqing 11-0 Zhu Hongxing 6-5</p>
<p>Shi Jiaqi 11-0 Feng Jialiang 5-6</p>
<p>Le Dezhi 9-2 Wang Zhihao 4-7</p>
<p>Gu Yuqi 7-4 Liu Wenkun 3-8</p>
<p>Zong Qiying 6-5 Zhao Yuru 1-10</p>

<h3>Ode to the Great Wall</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>I am the Great Wall!</p>
<p>In the universe, I can be considered immortal; in the universe, I can be considered majestic. Who doesn't say the Great Wall is majestic? Who can compare to me? The Grand Canal is my younger brother, but parts of him are paralyzed. The Porcelain Tower seems petite compared to me; the Roman Colosseum is just a skeleton; and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon have become underground ruins. I seem to have come with the Earth, and I also show the highest creation of mankind!</p>
<p>What about the pyramids of Egypt? Aren't they also ancient and majestic?</p>
<p>I laughed heartily. The pyramids are my older brother, but they only protect one person, a dead despotic tyrant. What about me? I roar, and the heart of the earth trembles! I protect millions of people, millions of living lives!</p>
<p>Hundreds of miles of yellow sand, thousands of ren of high mountains, the wilderness is all within my sight. Like Pangu, I stretch out my sturdy arms, embracing half of the land, glaring fiercely, with bronze tendons and iron bones, without the slightest wavering. Who dares to break in? Who wants to seize the people in my embrace?</p>
<p>The wind comes to tell me that the Xiongnu cavalry is coming.</p>
<p>I am silent, because I know my own strength. The Xiongnu are coming, horses rushing, shouts like a tide, swords and soldiers waving; but for me, what are these worth? I stand still, every muscle clanging, every joint tightly contracted. The Hu cavalry is approaching, I am ready to fight them! Look! Ten thousand arrows shoot from the top of my head, followed by countless boulders, rolling logs, torches, caltrops, rushing towards the invading northern barbarians. I stand firm, clench my teeth, and use all my strength, not letting a single rider pass. Drums thunder, the sky howls and the earth trembles, the Hu soldiers fall, wail, and are defeated. The battlefield is piled with their broken armor and broken swords, as well as their severed limbs and remains.</p>
<p>Great Wall, great Great Wall! Someone cheers for me.</p>
<p>Centuries pass, the northern cavalry fall below me, again and again, and I am still unharmed, my people are still strong. Hundreds of miles of yellow sand, thousands of ren of high mountains, the wilderness is all within my sight. The pulse of the motherland has been beating, never interrupted. Every dawn, the national flag is raised on my turret to the sound of golden horns, my blood is young again, I know that I am always guarding the border of China, I know what my responsibility is.</p>
<p>This time the wind comes to tell me again: the Xiongnu cavalry is coming.</p>
<p>Shall I give in? I have never given in for thousands of years! I must stand stronger! I will protect China! Look! Heroic resistance is underway!</p>

<h3>A Corner of an Evil Den</h3>
<p>— Shi Jin</p>
<p>I am an orphan without parents. After escaping from the occupied area last year, I have been living in the home of my only relative. They run a small pharmacy, using half of a side room as the shop and half as the bedroom. Because there are too many people, there is not enough space, so a loft has been built in the bedroom. The half of the side room, which originally lacked light, now appears even darker.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the alley where I live, on busy Nanjing Road, could be considered a top-notch place for gentlemen, merchants, and lodgers. Now, the situation has not changed. Although there are no "long one two" dance halls, the alley is filled with guide girls. I have carefully calculated with them that, on average, each household occupies three. In addition, there are also black market restaurants and clandestine prostitutes. Aside from them, decent families account for only about 10 percent, and doctors of various specialties also account for 10 percent.</p>
<p>Although the house where I live has only two floors, it is occupied by eight families. The downstairs living room and the three small rooms in the back are rented to four families, whose lives depend on their "daughters." Upstairs are the clandestine prostitutes and the black market restaurant. At dusk, the opium addicts, with ashen faces and hunched shoulders, sluggishly climb the stairs in an endless stream. When they come back down, they look more energetic and shake the stairs. On the other hand, the clandestine prostitutes, their faces covered in red and white makeup, look like corpses crawling out of coffins; two walk in front, followed by a madam. They go to the rooftop garden or the street to solicit their "business." The guide girls, dressed in gaudy colors, take taxis to their headquarters to prepare for "work."</p>
<p>I am a student, and every day when I return home from school in the afternoon, the piercing sound of a qin disrupts my peaceful mood. The sharp singing further stirs up various thoughts. The faces of lively children also flash before me. They are three sisters with different surnames, raised by their godmother. She has specially hired a qin teacher to come and teach them to sing every afternoon. When they reach a certain age, the godmother can recover her investment with interest, and can also make a big profit. It only takes a few years of effort to sit and eat for the rest of her life. What's not to like about such a good business?</p>
<p>The eldest girl is named Jingdi, and she is only fourteen years old. Her sister is only ten years old. Another sister is only nine years old. Although they are taught "honor and profit" by their godmother every day, they have not lost their innocence.</p>
<p>One night, I asked Jingdi if she had ever studied. She said, "I studied for three years, and I really want to study." But Mom said I'm getting older, and girls only need to know a few words. I should learn to sing instead! If I learn to sing, I can earn money, why bother going to school? So I stopped going to school the year before last. Mom said she would ask me to sing in the company's "Qunfang Hui" next spring. When she talked about singing in the "Qunfang Hui," a proud smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Her words filled my heart with nameless pain. I really wanted to correct her wrong ideas, but her godmother came to call her to sleep. I couldn't talk to her any further.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear the sound of the qin, I think that in two or three years, another pure girl will be sacrificed in this den of vice.</p>

<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>"It's not that I'm unwilling to help, but this Madam is really hard to talk to! You can ask Seventh Master about it in the future, Mr. Wu."</p>
<p>The thought that "with a generous reward, there must be a brave man" suddenly surged into Zhao Si's brain; he looked at Ji Zhaoxiong's face, which was mostly skin and bone, and matched with an eagle-claw-like nose, and knew that he was definitely not an honest fellow.</p>
<p>"Big Brother, as long as you help us once, we will definitely not let you work for nothing!" Zhao Si said with a face full of fake smiles.</p>
<p>This sentence was very powerful, and some smiles suddenly appeared on Ji Zhaoxiong's face. He couldn't resist Zhao Si whispering a bunch of nonsense in his ear, and he actually agreed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, it all depends on your luck!" Ji Zhaoxiong said as he walked in. He himself obviously didn't have much confidence in this matter.</p>
<p>"The first hurdle can be considered cleared!" Zhao Si said, perching half his buttocks on a sofa, looking very uneasy.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia couldn't help but let out a deep sigh. He not only knew that the first hurdle Zhao Si was referring to was whether Ji Zhaoxiong would be willing to go in and report, but also knew that there were second and third hurdles, namely whether the concubine would be willing to intercede with Governor Hu for him, and whether Shen Mazi Fang would still propose any conditions once he had Governor Hu's backing.</p>
<p>But the evolution of events is always unexpected; Autumn Begonia and Zhao Si sat facing each other and waited for more than ten minutes, and Ji Zhaoxiong had already jumped out happily. "I didn't make you run in vain, Madam is coming out soon...! But, Mr. Wu, don't forget what Brother Zhao Si said just now!" He said the following sentence very quietly, almost like a whisper, but its importance was obvious, and Zhao Si and Autumn Begonia both nodded to him at the same time. (47)</p>

<h3>Twelve Outstanding Actors of the Male Role by Tan Modern Acting School</h3>
<p>— Li Yunying</p>
<p>Since the successive passing of older generation actors such as Cheng Changgeng, Yu San'sheng, Tan Xinzen, Liu Hongsheng, Zai Xiaonong, and Sun Juxian, there are only twelve rising stars in the male role acting field to this day. From this, one can see a glimpse of the decline of talent in the Peking Opera world. As the saying goes, "One top scholar can be produced in ten years, but an outstanding actor is hard to find in ten years." Is this truly the case?</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan - He is the grandson of Yu San'sheng and the son of Little Yu San'sheng, and he was praised as Little Little Yu San'sheng in his youth. His art is based on the Tan school. His singing voice is a natural gift, clear, bright, sweet, and mellow. He is competent in both civil and military operas, as well as Kunqu Opera. Even his stage presence and movements are free of vulgarity. He can be called a master of perfection. It is no accident that he can hold the leading position in the bearded male role. Unfortunately, he has been suffering from rectal bleeding recently, and his weak health makes it difficult for him to perform. He has been absent from the opera stage for several years now. If we want to see his excellent performances again in the future, it may be a long and hopeless wait.</p>
<p>Meng Xiaodong - She can be called Yu Shuyan's successor. Although she is a female actress, her voice is not feminine. Her voice is mature and strong. Her stage presence, appearance, and movements all follow the rules. Plays such as "The Empty City Stratagem," "Visiting the Mother," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "The Strange Injustice Reported," and "Scolding Cao" are all her masterpieces. Since her divorce from Wan Hua, she has cut off visitors and buried herself in research. Recently, she has been burning incense and chanting Buddhist scriptures at home, seemingly seeing through the mortal world. However, she values her art as her life. Recently, she has invited the veteran actor Bao Jixiang to explain the plays to her, and she also seeks advice from Yu Shuyan in her spare time. Her future is surely limitless.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng - He is an amateur who became a professional actor. He originally followed the Tan school. In his later years, as he got older, his breath became short and his voice narrow. Therefore, he created his own style, with his singing tending towards delicacy and risk-taking. Because he is quite knowledgeable and spares no effort in studying phonology, the words he sings are more accurate than other actors. However, he also suffers from excessive performance, leading to criticism of his strange tone. Yan has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Shaopeng, studies acting under Ma Lianliang. The second son, Xiaopeng, practices martial arts roles. Both are promising talents. The eldest daughter married an outsider a month ago. The second daughter, Huizhu, came to Shanghai with her father the year before last and made a splash, performing in plays such as "The Hu Family Village," "Scolding the Emperor," and "Celebrating the Precious Pearl." She was extremely popular for a while. Then, she was hired by the film industry to shoot the film "The Three Mothers Teaching the Son."</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang - His courtesy name is Wenru. He is a Muslim. He studied at Fu Liancheng Opera School. In the past, his art was based on Jia Honglin. Because of a voice illness, his performances emphasized acting more. Plays such as "A Handful of Snow," "Meeting of Heroes," "Stealing the Imperial Examination Papers," "The Pure Official's Record," and "Ten Memorials" are his strengths. I came to Shanghai a few years ago and listened to his voice, which seemed better than before. Lianliang's outstanding quality is his handsome appearance. There is nothing else to commend. The reason why the Ma school of opera is so popular is that many actors in the north with weak voices use studying the Ma school as their selling point. It is just like the abundance of Qi school actors in Jiangnan. The north and south reflect each other, and it is not a unique phenomenon.</p>
<p>Yang Baosen - He studied at Binqingshe Opera School. He has an elder brother named Baozhong, who also practices male roles. His younger brother, Baoyi, practices female roles. He passed away the year before last. Baosen is most loyal to Yu Shuyan, imitating his singing, recitation, acting, and even stage presence and movements. Unfortunately, his face lacks dramatic expression. Recently, his voice has become much better, with maturity and charm. I recently heard his performances in "Entering the Palace Twice," "Visiting the Mother," and "The Empty City Stratagem," which were very enjoyable. He is still young. If he can work hard and study diligently, it is not difficult for him to inherit Yu Shuyan's legacy.</p>
<p>Xi Xiaobo - He is also an amateur who became a professional actor. His art combines the strengths of the Yu, Yan, and Ma schools. He is extremely intelligent and can be called the number one rising star in the male role acting field today. Yu school plays such as "The Empty City Stratagem," "Visiting the Mother and Returning the Order," and "Scolding Cao" are performed quite well by him. He is also skilled in Yan school plays such as "Ascending to Heaven," "Yielding Xuzhou," and "Swallowing the Hatred of Wu." Even Ma school masterpieces such as "Borrowing the East Wind," "Ganlu Temple," and "A Handful of Snow" are performed vividly by him.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from "The Thief of Bagdad"</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>The reason why the British film industry can still get a share of the market from Hollywood is due to Alexander Korda. He was not originally British, but was born in Hungary. Later, he and his two younger brothers started filmmaking in London. At first, they were unknown until "The Private Life of Henry VIII," starring Charles Laughton, was released, which shocked Hollywood, and Laughton became famous as a result. Korda's productions that we are familiar with include "The Private Life of Don Juan," "Drums," and "The Four Feathers." Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Robert Donat, the child prodigy Sabu, and his wife Merle Oberon were all discovered by him and have now become stars. After the outbreak of the European War, the British film industry stagnated. He decided to move to Hollywood, and "The Thief of Bagdad" was completed in Hollywood. Now he is starting work on another new film.</p>
<p>"The Thief of Bagdad" is a famous Arabian myth from One Thousand and One Nights. In the film, Sabu finds a bottle on the beach. Inside the bottle is the Djinn, played by Rex Ingram, who asks Sabu to release him. When he is freed, he immediately transforms into a giant over four hundred feet tall and places the city of Ragdad under his knee. In one scene, Sabu stands in his palm. When filming, the giant hand was modeled from seven tons of clay, measuring over forty feet from elbow to fingertip.</p>
<p>John Justin, who received good reviews in "The Thief of Bagdad," is very handsome and a qualified pilot. When the film was finished and he returned to London, the Mexican girls of Los Angeles gave him a "Little Yu" brand necklace, which he wore around his neck, to wish him a safe journey and safe travels in the air. John has only spent a short time in Hollywood, but he has already become a popular heartthrob for the beautiful Mexican girls.</p>
<p>June Duprez's father is a famous comedian. She has aspired to dedicate herself to the screen since she was a child, but she went through small companies without any fame. Later, she responded to an actor test and was appreciated by Alexander Korda, who promoted her to the female lead in "The Four Feathers." As expected of a family of actors, they do not produce ordinary daughters. Her performance was very remarkable, and her beauty was enhanced by the color film. The success of "The Thief of Bagdad" is even greater than "The Four Feathers." When she first applied for the role, she did not mention her father's name. Only later did people find out, which shows that the young daughter had something to rely on, further highlighting her extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>Many shots in "The Thief of Bagdad" were taken with great effort, such as the flying horse in the sky, the giant coming out of the bottle, the child turning into a dog, and the dog turning back into a child. The color designer Vincent Korda and the photographer Georges Périnal have done their best in this regard. The cost of this film is two million US dollars, equivalent to thirty-six million Chinese dollars, which seems to be an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>A Life of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Struggle reveals that the environment is in opposition to you. Opposition naturally leads to obstacles, and obstacles are naturally unfavorable. But if you can continue to struggle, the degree of obstruction gradually decreases. Eventually, the environment will sympathize with you and reverse its previous opposing attitude.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Encounters Everywhere in Life</p>
<p>After listening to Xu Jing's account of his life, Zhang Cangqiu nodded and said, "So you are a born scholar. Although I am a rough warrior, I respect scholars very much. But I have already said that the world is changing rapidly, and there will be great chaos in the Central Plains, not to mention that the Tartars outside the Guan are gaining momentum and coveting the Ming Dynasty's territory every day! In recent years, there have been severe droughts and famines in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces. Even our own province is suffering from poverty and widespread banditry. A real man should be a hero in a chaotic world and do something earth-shattering. Do you want to learn from Zhuge Kongming by reciting poetry? Haha! I'm afraid there is no Liu Huangshu now!" As he said this, the whiskers on his cheeks spread out, like Zhong Kui. Xu Jing replied calmly, "Speaking of martial arts, I, from the town of Po, can be said to know a thing or two, but unfortunately, I am not proficient in literature, nor am I skilled in martial arts. It is embarrassing to say." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Good, where did you learn your martial arts?" Xu Jing smiled and said, "Several years ago, my father had an old friend named Wang Yongtai who came from Daizhou and stayed here for a year. He was a master of martial arts. Although he was old, his skills were high. With nothing to do, he taught me the art of fighting every morning and evening, and explained it in detail, so I made great progress. It is a pity that he went to Daizhou for some business after a year. I had to study hard in my spare time, practice some kung fu, and not let it go to waste. However, I only dabbled in it superficially, and I have always regretted this." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Of course, martial arts need to be guided by capable people, but it also depends on one's own hard work to make progress. Since you know martial arts, you should ride a horse to kill the enemy and write memorials on horseback. You should seize the opportunity to rise up. As the saying goes, 'Times create heroes.' Do you have this intention?" Xu Jing replied, "Mencius said it well, 'Those who wait for King Wen to rise are ordinary people. As for heroes, they will rise even without King Wen.' Nowadays, the Ming Emperor is weak, and internal and external troubles arise one after another. We should rise up at the crowing of the rooster and serve the country. However, it is a pity that although there are good horses, there are not always good horse judges. If they are humiliated in the hands of slaves and die between troughs, it is better not to go out." After listening to Xu Jing's words, Zhang Cangqiu also sighed, "This depends on each person's encounters. For example, Lord Xiong Tingbi and Yuan Chonghuan guarded the border and repeatedly repelled the Qing soldiers. They can all be considered heroes. But they were slandered despite their loyalty, and their ambitions were not realized. As a result, they destroyed the Great Wall themselves and were laughed at by the enemy. Isn't it a pity? Now General Wu is young and handsome and quite famous. I just don't know if he can continue the ambitions of Xiong and Yuan to consolidate the country and be considered a hero." (Four)</p>
