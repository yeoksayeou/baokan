<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹大戰前瞻</h3>
<p>國際在這數日內，又連續的呈現若干新形態，這與其認爲劇變，無寗認爲直綫的必然的開展，其間並無何種意外。在德義兩國宣布進侵南斯拉夫的同一天，英國軍隊在東非洲方面擊潰了義軍，攻入了阿迪斯阿巴巴，造就了阿比西尼亞國王塞拉西重返故都，光復阿國的機會；阿境之內，目前尙有不少的義方殘軍，倘非士氣頹喪，其數量上猶堪作一殊死戰，故東非戰事尙未結束，亦即阿國尙未淸澄；但義國要重振軍威，反敗為勝，至少在東非方面可以推斷其爲已頻絕望，阿王復國可以推斷其把握了十八九；塞拉西國破家亡而投奔英法，是一九三六年的事；越五年，到今日，目覩强暴失勢，可謂合該有此一日，這眞是夠興奮，却非意外。</p>
<p>歐戰擴展至於巴爾幹，乃為自始即屬勢所必然；允自義大利發動侵希，希臘奮起抗戰之後，巴爾幹不但充滿了火藥氣息，且可謂既被火燄所蔓延，半島諸國怎得置身事外？故南斯拉夫終於捲入漩渦，未可意外視之。所得視為意外的；倒是南國到現在纔牽涉，而南國之外的保加利亞與羅馬尼亞，雖已遭了踐踏，喪了自由，到現在還是抱殘守缺，既未乘機攘臂而起，倒戈自强，亦未助紂爲虐，發揮其爲爪牙工具的功用；更如土耳其，不但條的義務上可謂早有問題，即事實威脅上，至少自希臘與南斯拉夫被侵起，亦應不復能假作痴聾，却意外的主今保持其中立地位。一切意外，每每為常情恒理所吾定。據昨日電訉，土耳其方面同情希臘南斯拉夫而暗示其保持中立的限度乃為保加利亞不對希南兩國下井投石；同時復傳希臘對於進攻的德軍，已在某地點予以擊退而反攻作戰於保境了；南斯拉夫於接受挑戰之後，空軍已飛往德國控制之下的羅馬尼亞，轟炸油田了；這些動態，顯示巴爾幹方面戰爭範圍正在加速的繼續延擴之中，而意外的至今站在漩渦沿邊的諸國，瞬將無法長此滯留於現階段。總之，俱將為大戰中之一員。</p>
<p>這原來可視為意外之列：希臘對義抗戰之中，英國幫助希臘雖屬公開，而希臘方面所滲人的英國軍事力量，則猶為公開秘密；及至前天德義對南斯拉夫，德國對希臘，同時宣戰之後，英國軍隊始正式出現於希臘，於是巴爾幹方面有了英希南三國聯軍，這是新姿態。由英希南三國的公然聯合作戰，於是在法理上，在方式上，立即觸發新疑問，即德義日三國盟的的第三條，究竟怎樣解釋？在義希開戰的時候，還可諉爲盟的以外的另一事件，德日兩國故意躱閃了這一問題而分頭的各行其是。現在希南兩國公然與三國盟的的敵國駢肩作戰了，怎得再解釋爲與三風盟的無關？不容解釋爲無關，然則盟友日本將對南斯拉夫怎樣，對英國怎樣？</p>
<p>追求解釋，不是咬文嚼字的消閑，不是學究先生的頭巾氣；却欲覘知三國盟的的道德理智精神與價値，欲覘知有關三國盟的的一切；允欲覘知力主勾結德義，强化盟的，剛巧歷聘德義而大言炎炎的日本外相松岡，此行究竟有何成就，究竟如何影響及於盟的的一切。因此樂聞言辭的解釋、樂見事實的解釋。以意度之，松岡鎩羽歸去，將三緘其口，不作何種直接解釋吧！要解釋，還得觀望巴爾幹戰事如何開展，如何告一段落。假使德義在巴爾幹方面卓著戰功，得了壓倒的勝利，當然可使三國盟的光燄氣勢再度高張。勝負常事，誰得逆知；而自法國降服。歐西戰局停滯之後，英德雙方的陸上戰鬥力量未有較量機會；在戰爭初期確是屢戰屢勝的德軍，久未表演其身手；最近在利比亞方面，德軍助義反攻，逼使央軍放棄班加齊，但祗能視為大戰中的褊師交鋒，性質上異於主力的正面作戰：故今後在巴爾幹大戰的戰塲上，德方的士氣與力量比較初期如何，英國已經有對抗德方新戰術的經驗之後戰績如何，目前皆應留為疑問而待事實答復。此一戰，在英國有聲威的關係，在希南兩國有暫時禍福痛癢的關係，在德義方面則異是。因爲巴爾幹大戰的性質，假使德義敗了，納粹法西斯將如日薄崦嵫，一蹶不振，縱令大戰不能即此結束，但最後勝敗之數可謂決定了，故此戰在德義是決戰的性質；假使英希南三國聯軍敗了，希南將如十個月來的法蘭西，甚至如五年來的阿比西尼亞，遭盡磨折苦難，自在意中，然英國決不從此罷休，再接再厲，方興未艾，故在英國非決戰的性質；易言之，戰爭全局，以及英希南三國，乃至法比荷挪諸國的運命，在民治國方面將不因巴爾幹大戰而決定，亦即巴爾幹大戰對於民治國並無決定的作用。然其勝負影響所及，必致波動國際的別一面，不但日本觀望着而已。</p>

<p>（蘇州特訊）蘇州觀東洙泗巷口，採芝齊糖果號，創設達數百載，出售糖果密餞，悉能遵照祖傳密法，親自監製，名聞遐邇，有口皆碑。初由長兄任經理，於九年前，忽然辭退，當將本店弟兄共本貨特，盤定資本，仍交本主人接替營業。立有契據，囑命承包長兄名下營業權利，不負盈虧責任，年取租金達萬元。初不料長兄心懷叵測，早萌異心，故意在觀西自創悅采芳糖果茶食號，陰謀對壘，本主人以先人遺業，理應竭力維持，和衷共濟，期毋墜先人信譽，故本主人雖荷此巨艱，慘淡經營，幸能克承祖業，引為私慰。國變後，復在上海愛多亞路，虞洽卿路口，分設蘇州採芝濟支店。以能貨真價實，精益求精，營業駸駸日上。去年長兄忽又變計，指現在特殊情形，貨價狂漲，以其囤積居奇之心理，欲將九年前盤定貨價，重行核算。不惜煮豆燃箕，抹煞事實，甘心與訟，訴由法院假執行。並將『悅之芳』頂用『采芝齊』三字牌號。乃本店自被禁用『采芝齊』牌號後，卽繼績無招牌營業，卒賴主顧信用，營業數額，依舊有加弗替。惟遠地顧客，容有未明內幕，感蒙關注，不絕垂部。爰將經過情形，揭露報端，於希台營豋。按；『蘇州采芝齊　開設觀前街洙泗巷口第二家。上海『蘇州采芝齊』支店，在虞洽卿路七號，大世界對面。除此家以外，全國槪無分支。現在蘇州縣掛采芝齊招牌處，卽系悅採芳之改頭換面。真正『蘇州采芝齊』，暫無招牌營業，務希各界注意為幸</p>
<h3>歐戰叢談（四三）　戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>德國人並沒有飢饉。衹有一相情願的和消息不靈道的始相信他們巳經在挨餓了。事實是這樣的，在一年又半的被對鎖後，國社黨仍能設法供養德國人民。美國人對於德人戰時所吃的東西極難下咽，但是德國人於半世紀以來對於大量的番薯，捲心菜和麵包，巳甘之如飴，他們現在還是僅量吃著番薯，捲心菜和麵包。</p>
<p>德國人於肉類，脂油，牛油及水菓，大感缺乏。現在規定每人每星期可得肉一磅，牛油或人造牛油四分之一磅，這份量比較平時所吃的巳減少甚多，但是照這樣的份量，似乎還可以維持他們的康健。所感困難的，含有維他命最豐富的水菓常缺乏。去冬德國大寒，水菓的收獲極少，當我於十二月間離開柏林時，市上所出售的僅有蘋果一種。這種水菓衹有小孩子，病人和孕婦方能享受。會有一時盛傳德國可自義大利和西班牙獲得橘子，結果並未實現。開戰後第一個冬天中，我連一隻橘子或一隻香蕉都沒有見到過。目下巳有品質低劣的維他命丸藥發給兵士或小孩子吃。兵士所吃的東西比較平民要高明得多，去年聖誕節並不是家庭中人把食物送至西統兵士去吃，倒是好幾十萬的兵士，把他們口糧上省下來的牛油，乳酪，水菓和咖啡等，一包包地朝家裏送。第一次歐戰時，家裏人常為在前綫的健兒担憂，在這一次戰爭中，前綫的戰士們倒掛念起家庭中的親族了。</p>
<p>自從德軍攻下丹麥之後，柏林市上似乎可以獲得少量的牛油和熏肉，雖則大家的口糧並未上增。但是這種供給並不能持久，因丹麥的家畜向恃外來的　秼飼　，而德人則無法獲得這種飼料。即以食料一端來講，淪陷各國之於德人，倒成為他的負担了。</p>
<p>戰爭爆發之後，德國人即無咖啡，茶和朱古律，以資飲用。他們所吃的為一種味似洗碟水的焦大麥。德人目與瑞士，西班牙，葡萄牙和南美的商行訂立密約後，在逃過央國海軍對鎖之下，去年秋季，市上巳稍有朱古律發現。此外，德人還從估領區中弄到少許的這種東西。到聖誕節時，大約每份人家可以購得一磅左右的糖果。當我離開柏林的前一天，目覩安靜而抱有希望的德人，很忍耐地排成一長條，站在阿特隆旅館裏的一　小糖果舖子前，等待分配聖誕朱古律糖。</p>
<p>德國人有時為購買煙草，也得排成個一字長蛇陣。煙草雖不在限制之列，但是煙舖子都奉到政府的命令，在一天之內，對於任何顧客，不得售以一包以上的香煙和兩包以上的雪茄。德國香煙每包大半為十二支，現在足數的很少，品質也大為低劣。香味不純的德產煙草目下銷路甚多。德人在戰時所吸的煙，再無過於去秋我在英法海峽所見德兵所吸者之佳的了。他們那時抽著英國所出的「金磚」牌，這是從法國勒哈佛港所獲的英軍遺物。</p>
<p>炎柴的供給一時頗為銳減。抽板煙的人大不方便，他們因為弄不到好煙草，目下只得勉強去吸那種點燃不著的低劣煙草。備有打炎機的人，就是幾格蘭姆的油也巳無處可得。</p>
<p>最近市上的火柴巳多，少數店舖亦巳偷偷摸摸地把燃油供給顧客。</p>
<p>德人旣感覺戰時神經緊張，而所有的錢又不能用以購買食物，衣著，或汽車之類，衹有把錢耗於可購之物，於是飲酒之舉一時蔚為風氣了。在德軍開始侵略波蘭則旬日中，柏林大人家視酒舖為樂園，趨之節省榖麥，用作食品或飼料。著名的「畢爾森」啤酒現在巳面目全非，令人無從認識了。此外，德國出名的紅葡萄酒，供應量亦巳大為減少，在去年夏季，要是你認識不得魯伊思阿特隆的話，那末在柏林就很難購得一瓶紅葡萄酒。酒排章中早巳不供給花生米，杏仁，橄欖或番薯片。花生米等三種東西，德國巳經沒有，番油料，故亦巳取消。只有不費錢的絞環形小餅干，還能巍然獲存。</p>
<p>德軍究竟從法國弄來了多少香賓酒，確數雖不得知，但是至少總以數百萬瓶計。李本特洛甫從則會做過德國亨格爾香賓酒公司的框銷主任，想來他還是在吃德廉街上其他各部長的官邸門前，裝卸法國香賓的卡車不一而足，由此看來，他們現在未必再喝那德國自造的香賓了。</p>
<p>柏林飲酒之風雖盛，賣笑生涯卻大受打擊。從前操神女生涯者現在都巳人工廠，或至田間工作，而且在燈火管制之下，大家看不清楚，空襲警報聲中，街上又弄得闑焉無人，故而賣笑生涯頗為不利。（未完）</p>

<h3>工董選舉不致舉行　英美日人選決定　額外董事兩席競爭仍烈　華納稅人注視今後發展</h3>
<p>今年工部局董事選舉事、自經月初費利溥發表重要談話寬稱改變董事名額後遂打破以往沈寂之狀態、各國僑民團體即開始活動、允以德國及「其他國籍」之僑民無不躍躍欲試、推出候選人、而在工部局中佔一席地、故各方情形、殊為緊張、唯依照洋涇浜地皮章程二十八條明文規定、改變工黃比數為英美日各三、華四、德一及其他國籍二人之議、必須經中國各條約國及中國合法政府之批准、方為有效、不意昨日各僑民團體、竟依照「新比率」將下屆二董候選人推出、茲誌各情如决、</p>
<p>本年選舉　或將作罷</p>
<p>工部局英美日德董事候選人姓名、昨已探悉、由此可知工董選舉，本年不致舉行、而英美日三國總領事、將於公共租界納稅人特會中提出增加工董席决之決議案、主張推定董事十六人一事、當可　利實行、</p>
<p>英美日董　均經推出</p>
<p>聞諸可靠方面、英僑方面因英董將放棄二　、故僅將惟凱自威鮑威　與米契爾三氏出任英董、昨日（七日）確悉、美僑方面已推定麥唐納爾（衛利韓公司）出任另添之一席美董、聞麥氏係美僑協曾上星期五日會議時推出者、餘兩美董為明思德與阿樂滿、昨晨又聞諸可恃方面、日董將由岡本乙一·岡本一策·與塙雄太郞三氏出仟、後兩人乃現任日董、岡本乙一前亦曾任日董、</p>
<p>額外兩席　競選劇烈</p>
<p>又訊、德籍董事一席、將由本埠德僑高來德氏担任、至其他國籍之董事兩席、可望由葡萄牙及瑞士籍各一人担任之、唯姓名則尙未透露、按其他國籍之董事兩席、各方競選劇烈、瑞士籍之惠特勒、即鉅額銅塊竊案之主角、首先嚮應、按渠將參加競選、繼則葡萄牙總領事梅樂聲明　將竭力為滬六千葡僑在工部局中爭取一席、葡董候選人、呼聲最高者為泰弗拉斯博士、羅立嗣及任職怡和洋行之蘇石等、後俄僑協會亦由會長伊凡諾夫召集會議、圖參加本屆工董選舉、唯觀察情勢、葡瑞僑民成功之希望較大、但惠特勒仰日人鼻息行事、輿論反對甚烈、而瑞領亦宣稱惠之通緝令幷未撤銷、俄方之伊凡諾夫、乃前會長梅拉滋被刺後之白俄協會會長、</p>
<p>袁履登氏　昨日表示</p>
<p>華董方面、自由納稅華人以通信方法推定現仟董事虞洽卿·袁履登·陳霆銳·奚玉書及郭順等五人蟬聯後、幷無任何發展、後虞·陳·郭·三董先後離滬、所餘者僅袁履登及奚玉書兩人、昨據袁氏語新聲社記者稱、納稅華人會對於下屆董事選舉之特別情形、仍無所動作、召開會議另選董事補缺一事、目前亦不可能、因納稅華人中僅一半留滬也、按依照三總領所定之方案、華董由五席减至四席、以目前留滬者兩人、故尙有兩席出缺、各方封此所遺兩席之候補問題、極爲汪意、蓋在此困難情形之下、華董之地位、與他國董事完全不同、故今後之發展、極可注意、</p>
<p>從法理言　頗有訾議</p>
<p>依照地皮章程第九條之規定、工部局董事選舉應在納稅年會舉行前一星期舉行、而現仟董事至納稅年會舉行時任滿、由新董事正式就任、按之今年特別情形、工董人數改變、須先由納稅特會通過、縱由各條的國核准、最後取得中國合法政府之同意、方爲有效、而可實施、故今年選舉、理當在納稅特會舉行之後、而今各　民團體竟在該建議未得中國各條的國及中國政府核准之前、擅依新比率將候選董事選出、自法理之觀點言之、殊屬不當、</p>
<h3>昨晨租界西區　一度戒嚴</h3>
<p>公共租界與法租界昆鄰滬西區域之各馬路、於昨日午前十時許、曾一度施行戒嚴、兩租界警務當局、派捕將由靜安寺起沿海格路通往滬西之各馬路進出口處、一律用鐵絲網臨時封鎖、僅准電車與公共汽車經過、行人等則被阻止出入、滬西「特警」、亦施行同樣之戒備、約歷一小時許、始恢復交通、惟對於進出行人、　查仍嚴、據悉係因傅筱庵昨日擇地埋葬、恐發生意外事件、故有此臨時戒備、</p>
<h3>德使館開映　歐戰影片</h3>
<p>德國駐華大使館情報專昌柯德、昨日下午四時半、假大西路一號德國學堂招待本市中外新聞界參觀最近運滬關於歐戰之新聞片、到中外新聞界四十餘人、首由柯德致辭後、繼即放映電影、內容為德匈保羅在維也納簽訂軸心國同盟等數幕、六時半始散、</p>
<h3>中交兩行職員　今日恢復自由</h3>
<p>據今晨本報所得消息、中國交通兩銀行職員百餘人、於上月被覊、現經本埠中外金融界人士多方洽商、巳達解決階段、聞今日即可完全恢復自由、</p>
<h3>租船運米事　接洽已有頭緒</h3>
<p>煤球廠盤驟抬七十元</p>
<p>當局自積極設法疏通洋米來源後、業已成立租船委員會、專責辦理租船事宜、將該項租得之船隻、行駛於上海與仰光間、俾每月由仰光運米一萬五千噸至二萬噸來滬、新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、兩當局自分別進行租船事宜後、刻已獲有相當進展、聞運米船隻、及運輸水脚、均經次第洽妥、不久即可供諸正當米商裝載洋米、惟該項船隻運抵米糧、屆時須向當局登記、吾則即不得享受該項權利、</p>
<p>業外訂米　應予拒絕</p>
<p>本市各米行向海外訂購洋米、皆係委諸達孚合義等洋行代電成交、惟一般業外投機者、以經營米糧獲利頗厚、爰亦委諸各該洋行、訂購鉅額洋米、運滬儲藏、待米市發生騷動時、即將該項囤貨故意抬價、决第吐脫、並揑造是非、佈謠市塲、圖惑人心、今全市各界盼望各洋行從速拒絕業外人委訂鉅額洋米、俾便杜絕業外人經營米糧、</p>
<p>煤價已屆　嚴重關頭</p>
<p>本市整個燃料問題、頃已屆最嚴重關頭、市價之飛騰、市况之混亂、巳破歷所罕見之新紀錄、惟其來源並未稍遜往昔、運輸水脚每噸亦不過美金六元、故大宗煤塊屑均能由海外次第運滬、煤棧存底有增無减、而煤商成本亦顯頗低微、且水脚雖已稍漲、而該項煤斤、尙未抵埠、現市塲買賣、皆於一二月前運抵者、</p>
<p>擅抬市價　駭人聽聞</p>
<p>今烟白煤每噸最高售價，均已被衝破四百元大關、並竟至有市無貨之局面、大戶堅持囤貨、拒絕流通市上、並悉尙有一般煤儈、猶在市塲扒吸、大部份小型煤球廠、無法購得煤屑、一般柴炭行號現貨出售、市價頗不一律、茲悉某大煤球廠、除堅藏煤屑外、並竟於前日私行邀同同業、擅訂售價、每　竟被抬高達七十元之鉅、現　盤為二百九十六元、外加送力三元、門市每擔（一百市斤）十六元、</p>
<h3>港政府對行駛滬港各輪　檢查行李貨物</h3>
<p>乘客登輪後卽不准離輪</p>
<p>香港政府於四月一日起、嚴厲執行貨物及旅客行李檢查條例後、至於檢查範圍、只限於行駛滬港等大洋輪船、內河輪船不在檢查範圍以內、該條例實施後、凡由港寄運出口之貨物、以及由港往外地之旅客所携帶之行李、須經指定檢查官員檢查核准，發給放行證書後、始能運至輪上、吾則概不准携帶　口、</p>

<h3>各業工潮</h3>
<p>近因物價高漲、米價堅持、各業工人、向資方提出改善待遇要求、已解決者已有多起、未解決者尙在調解、並有數業工人、亦已提出耍求、茲誌如下、</p>
<p>成衣縫工　分配爭執</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉此次成衣匠醖釀罷工、結果縫衣代價已提增五成以上、例如女式旗袍、原來為單四元、夾五元、棉六元、男長衫價格亦同、現在旗袍單增為六元、夾七元、棉八元、男長衫單七元、夾八元、棉九元、自提增縫工後、工潮原可消弭、惟因勞資雙方又發生利益分配問題、查向來成衣舖、每成縫工打去九折後、店主與作頭司務各半拆賬、此條現維原狀、作頭司務應貼店主每日飯金五角、現在店主以米價飛漲、提出每日提增爲一元、作頭司務則祗答允照此次增加工資數、增加五成、計七角五分、店主不允、因之勞資雙方、發生異議、昨日已有大部份成衣工匠參加罷工、風潮有擴大趨勢、至前日在法租界賣裕里參加搗毀成衣舖之工人、已捕獲十三名、覊押捕房、聽候偵查依妨害秩序與毀損等罪法辦</p>
<p>搬塲公司　勞資相左寗波·友寗·永安·上天等四家搬塲公司全體司機、於前五日聯合向資方耍求增加生活津貼百分之百、於前晨起各該公司全體司機一百數十餘人、一律實行罷工、據大通社記者探悉、兩租界當局於前日下午派員前往各該公司進行調解、卒因雙方意見懸殊、故未能成立、該項工潮恐一時難以解決、聞昨日各公司小工亦發生罷工情事、又法租界馬浪路中華車行、日前將司機代表劉銘佑停職後、亦引起勞資糾紛、</p>
<h3>美國總會會所　又有出售消息　出價法幣二百廿餘萬元　傳由上海證券公司承購</h3>
<p>大陸報云、上海證券公司曾出價法幣二、二二五、〇〇〇元、願購美國總會、該總會乃於二月二十八日舉行特會推出特別委員會、討論此事、頃聞諸可靠方面、該待委會已向總會各會員建議、接受此項交易、略謂、總會會費等雖增、但因維持費迭漲、來歲總會欲求收支相抵、當頗困難、</p>
<p>下層仍租　總會使用</p>
<p>聞上海證劵公司提議願購美國總會時、曾允將會址下三層租予美國總會使用、爲期二年、並可展期兩年、上海證券公司並允將會所前門專供會方應用、而將上層改建寫宇間、在橫衖另闢一門出入、據美國總會會員聲稱、彼等對於買主上海證券公司、頗覺茫然、因行名錄上並無該公司之名稱也、又聞另有數方面亦欲承購該會所、但經特委會考慮之後、均已拒絕、因上海證劵公司出價最高也、</p>
<p>定期集會　討論出售</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國總會會員、定本月十日午後五時半、集會考慮該總會特委會建議將會所售予上海證券公司事、聞該公司允於承購會所後、將下層租予美國總會、月租為售價二·二二五·〇〇〇元之百分之三、即五·六二五元、水電費由總會方面負担七分之三、餘歸買主償付、會所內傢具與設備、仍屬會方、美國總會若接受出售之議、得款還債、尙餘百萬元、特委會主張將此餘軟易成美元、留作儲備金、於緊急時動用、</p>

<p>辯護律師　未能晤面</p>
<p>普萊梅律師昨晨聲稱、渠希望能見愛高、俾為其辯護、法海軍某軍官則吿彼、非至法海軍當局刻正進行之調查竣事、不許彼晤愛高、而從事調查、大的復需一週、始能完畢、的匝月後、審問愛高云、</p>
<p>本市法僑　甚覺不滿</p>

<h3>游覽自由中國的　赫明威的生平　美國當代戰爭文學家之介紹</h3>
<p>— 字楨</p>
<p>美國當代戰爭文學家赫明威，現在我國前綫和後方硯察，搜集新著的題村，茲介紹其生平及作風於後：</p>
<p>赫明威是現代美國文擅的怪傑，其全部作品，都以現實為題材，具有央國大詩人拜　一般的感人力量。其作品如一團火燄，常發出奇異和熱烈的魔力。作風非常粗暴，往往令人疑心他是一個蠻子，但實際上他是一條好漢。</p>
<p>他以一八九八年生於伊利諾州的橡園鎭。父親是個醫生，共生子女六人，他排行第二。自幼跟從父親學習射擊和捕魚，並在密歇根州北部游獵。十五歲時，會一度脫離家庭，但旋即回家，繼續在當地高等學校肄業。畢業後，任貢薩斯城星報的末等訪員。不數月，美國參加第一决歐戰，他被派到義大利前綫，先充看護兵，櫃編入步兵，後來作戰受傷。上决歐戰吿終，希臘·土耳其。戰爭繼之發生，他担任美國某報戰地記者，出入砲火綫上，又遍歷幾許風險。後來他到巴黎担任「托倫吐星報」的駐法訪員時，年紀雖不過二十二歲，却巳是飽經滄桑的了。</p>
<p>此時他在巴黎開始寫作，處女作「密歇根上游」，於一九二一年出版。其作風樸實無華，毫不矯揉造作。他喜用平凡的字句，表達眞摯的情感。讀者看到別個作家的作品，猶如走馬看花，隨意欣賞，但一讀到他的作品，不由覺得震顫和恐怖，感情為之沸騰不巳。</p>
<p>赫明威的第一部成功作品，是短篇小說集「我們的時代」，於一九二西年出版，描寫戰爭及鬥牛等故事。後二年，出版「旭日之升」，描寫一羣亡命者的故事。迨一九二九年，以上决歐戰為背景的戀愛小說「吿別戰爭」出版，就此一嗚驚人了。</p>
<p>其後又發表「午後的死亡」，「菲洲蔥嶺記」，「貧窮與富有」等出品。一九三七年西班牙內戰發生後，赫明威就到馬德里，任戰地記者，這是他思想轉變的一個重大關鍵。他旋即作成「第五縱隊」「西班牙大地」及長篇小說「號角鼓聲」（For　Whom　the　BellTolls）書。　（未完）赫明威夫婦</p>

<h3>巴爾幹大戰爆發　金價擊落不少　已進五百元關</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、跌風突銳、價已退入六千五百元大關內、各方人心虛浮，滬西幫補空二千餘兩、奈在利空謠風中、價仍越盤越低、乃報載德向南希宣戰、中美又有貸款成立之訊、下午更傳南軍失利、蘇日更有簽訂互不侵犯條的等訊、一般神經過敏者認爲日南進將積極、故雖見三家金號於晨開後力進、稍升至六千五百十五元、但不久即盤下至六千五百元內、下午最後半小時內、謠風更盛、金號銀號證券幫在一致賣風中、下跌突勁、退至收市爲六千四百五十五元、軋小八十二元、全日交易的二萬五六千兩、現金交易日稀、現金號多數觀望、費文元售予方九霞二十兩、價照期交高一百七十元、又售予熾大十兩、高一百八十元、下午高一百七十元有賣戶、未見成交、價比上週六的小九十餘元、飾金降十元、爲六百八十元、關金等均平、</p>

<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉又升十元</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、因來源仍乏、而內銷見活、故號貨扳持甚力、昨零星開出、又升十元、尙未肯多售、後市可望續緊、</p>
<h3>糧食　囤戶中途有出籠　米價漲後又回平</h3>
<p>米市塲、白掃募節及星期例假休業兩天、昨巳開市照常營業、早市開手、洋米市因本鄉店舖亟需添購、納胃　覺濃厚、買氣殊旺、浮戶見實銷活潑相繼亟出吸收、當時形勢栗落異常、販戶乘機扳抬、各價趨昂、立升元許、若一號西貢開百十元、二號百零七元半、百零七元、高白身小絞百零七元半、百零七元、中關百零六元、碎尖八十七元、不過經此一度蠢動、卒以來源續有大批抵埠、人心未免稍綏、實銷即復轉懈、同時浮　亦有紛紛出籠、原根客販更將大批現貨拋出、頃刻形成出多　少、供求不勻之局面、漲風頓遭挫折、各價步步回低至收市恢復原盤、統計先後一起一伏、較之週前適成定格、無甚榮辱、一號西貢仍為百零九元、二號百零六七元、一號暹邏百零八九元、火　高自百零八元，决百零六元、白身小絞百零六元半、百零六元、中關百零五元半、百零五元、東京砶尖九十七八元、粹尖八上六七元、决至八十一二元、</p>

<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨仍屬不旺、而銷塲方面、一般店舖因門市銷路不廣、納意依然不爽、故　主雖欲扳抬、終難獲願、結果僅能拷住未有軒輊而巳、若常帮斛見特白粳百上七八元高百十六元、淸特粳百念元、崑山斛見白粳百十四五元、大市百十一二元、次至百零九元、靑　斛見薄稻百零九元百零八元半、</p>

<h3>客銷活動　粉市轉穩</h3>
<p>緬粉　昨日粉市、上午開盤、買氣即濃、蓋以假期後、實銷漸動、聞南北客幫趁低均有收買、太街囤戶亦漸活躍、鐘樓花鳥牌　粉價開二十八元二三角、金龍牌坎粉初開二十八元、旋因客囤收買、價又暗緊、晚市前執貨者扳守愈甚、市面前途、或有開展之望、良以連疲多日、價位已低、頗引起業内外投機囤戶所注意也、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市情仍平淡無奇、因邇日存到雖稀、而各粉廠進胃殊屬呆懈、高杜麥四十五六元、已乏相當受主、惟執貨者始終堅持、不肯賤脫、故局勢尙在醞釀中、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油投機復盛　結果猛漲五六元</h3>
<p>豆油市面、前在多空角逐下、曾　釀多時、昨日波瀾突起、謠風瀰漫、投機慾熖　熾、多頭勢盛、行情挺進、在最高峯時比休市前暴騰六七元不等，中途雖由空頭傾壓、但杯水車薪、無濟於事、結果仍猛漲五六元、計成交烟歧油二十件、價爲一百元、大有廠油三百担、價爲一百零三元半至零七元、大連油一百桶、價爲一百四十三元半至一百四十七元，復爲一百四十六元二角半、訂四月上交三百桶、價爲一百四十三元至一百四十六元七角牛、訂四月下交一千餘桶、價爲一百四十四元五角至四十九元五角，復爲四十八元、</p>

<p>今（八日）有豆子五百三十包、運往厦門、又八百四十包、運往　　、又二百五十包、運往小呂宋、另有芝蔴三百七十五包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷並未十分發展　雙馬爲雜牌紗帶起</h3>
<p>紗市微現昂象、因人心轉爲堅挺、同時雜牌紗根子緊俏、二十支天女雙地球特金城一致趨向於上、與雙馬紗價之距離日見接近、所以人氣轉硬一步、不過實際交易未見十分發達、兼之巴爾幹形勢緊張、空頭壓力尙重、但多方之議論、謂白物上騰惟棉紗向下、對於吸收之籌碼、始終不棄、證劵幫復來購買、大都扒空、某某之空頭亦抵進不少、在此情形之下、或者可回好一些、二十支雙馬高價為一千四百元、低價爲一千三百九十一元、午後初做一千三百九十九元至四百元、旋後隨金價跌至一千三百九十四元、最後價爲一千三百九十五六元、今日有棉紗五件運厦門、又一百件運香港、又六百廿件運暹羅、又一百五十件運小呂宋、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市况平平、首盤價爲一千三百九十二元、微降至九十一元、此時買者踴躍、證券幫一律拖進一霎間漲全一千四百元、人氣雖緊張，然未能穿出四百元外、但後標金下落、賣戶稍活動、跌至一千三百九十二元半、然檯面上籌碼未見十分充斥、有一部份云、巴爾幹吃緊、市盤不下、　有利多可能、同時雜牌紗漲、買者反湧、陸續升至一千三百九十八元收盤、查牛日間成交統計五千二百八十包、茲將各幫口買夫之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉花廠胃漸開　同行買賣亦尙熱鬧</h3>
<p>現棉情况依然良好、允其四二支及三二支原料價格日見上升、此因細紗線價奇昂、廠方獲利豐厚、所以將此原料搜羅殷切、人心一致望高、至於念支原料、亦被其帶高矣、不過漲風較為和緩、惟同業互相買賣極盛、廠方華廠辦意漸見起色，昨廠商及同業互做、共計成交二千〇卅五件、價漲一二元、茲將現棉行市列左、</p>
<h3>證券　內債疲憊如故</h3>
<p>公　暗盤昨日市况依然振作不起、因多方進胃雖濃、但以得賤價爲妙、故逢有急於求售者、乃乘低收進、幷不抬價、市價以甲種爲最小、因領款滿期、售出歸墊之故、幷無其他作用、現在甲種與丙種價相差祇八元　角半、其便宜推為五種之冠、此種善價、此後恐不易得、因裕興乃領款滿期、脫貨求現、祇有甲種、仁豐和豐之甲種多頭、乃亦保留不住、昨日交易不多、上午信孚仍係買進、為數不弱、聚鑫怡太鑫豐益昌均有買進、行市初漲後跌、甲種由八角開盤跌至三角、因此其他各種亦均隨之而小、午後祇丙種較為堅定、信孚仍有買進、順昌進胃亦强、仁昌德隆亦有相當胃量、無如裕興仁豐和豐賣出、甲種獨多、故結果丙種幷無上落、而甲種跌去六角之多、其他乙丁戊種因亦隨勢小去二三角、成交總數、的共一百六七萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華銀行股五十股、價爲十三元正、合六折半、</p>
<h3>民誼藥廠發息</h3>
<p>民誼藥廠、爲本市三大藥廠之一、日前該廠董　聯席會議決議、二十九年度發息一分、自四月十六日起開始發給云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　駭人聽聞　煤球漲七十元</h3>
<p>煤球行情、昨又藉日水脚激增、同業廠盤、驟漲七十元、自車每噸為兩百丸十六元、本街門莊零售、每扣十六元、旬日間連漲兩决、達一百十元、殊屬驚人聽聞、雖飾詞靈妙、究難卸操縱之嫌、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粤港大量採辦　棉布又起漲風</h3>
<p>廠布　昨日市况激昂、乃因粵港幫大量採辦、刺激人心、同業及囤戶乘機搜囤、致寗靜之布市、又啟漲風、各布售盤晨開微昂、以後更步步升騰、結果白貨粗布每疋漲五角、細布斜紋每疋漲五角至一元、色布嗶嘰綫呢等貨漲一元左右、漂布及淺色布疋受客銷時令限制、漲勢較遜、製成品現市反較坯布爲康、怡和廠開出四五月份期　粗布一千餘包、華廠開出四月份細布斜紋一千數百件、多數由　業及染廠吸收、客銷粵港幫辦色布色斜等貨五百餘件、浙閩幫辦粗布色布等一百餘件、本街成交各布近十件、</p>

<p>修學講座</p>
<h3>什麼樣預備日常課（一）</h3>
<p>— 盧紹稷</p>
<p>一·日常功課的繁重</p>
<p>現今靑年學生功課繁多、而一人精力有限、倘沒有正當的指導、定難得到優良的效果、靑年學生修學的指導、以在那個時期為最重耍呢、這是毫無疑義的、在「中學時期」、因為現今中學生的日常功課、過於繁重了、就初中學生說、有公民·國文·英文·算學·博物·生理衛生·化學·物理·歷史·地理·勞作·圖畫·音樂·體育·童子軍等十五門科目、再就高中學生說、也有公民、國文·外國語·算學·生物·礦物·化學·物理·歷史·地理·勞作·圖畫·音樂·體育·軍訓等十五門科目、這許多科目、除掉藝術和體育　學科外、像國文·英文·算學·自然、社會等學科、都是要預備的、又像國·英算三科、因學習　難、預備時間都是要很多的、並且中學生這許多的日常功課、為將來研究各種高深學問之基礎、對於日常功課、倘能加以指導、使明瞭研究的途徑、那末他們治學、必將「井然有條、而無忙亂」、的毛病了、所以這篇文章所說的話、是偏重於中學生方面的、我國文化界關於靑年修學指導一類的文字、現在尙少、但美國敎育家威勃爾（G．M．Whipple）氏、曾者有「如何增加修學的效能」（How　to　Study　Effectively）一書、又美國敎育家康豪塞爾（A．W．Kornhaucer）氏也著有「實用學生修學法」（How　to　Study）一書、對於修學方法、詳述無遺、茲參考兩氏的主張、和作者自己的意見、將靑年學生預備日常功課的條件和方法、分別的說一說、</p>
<p>二·預備功課的條件</p>
<p>靑年學生預備日常功課、欲求其有優良的效果、須具有左列幾種條件、</p>
<p>（一）身體健康須能保持　靑年思想效率的大小、和神經中樞運用的效率有關係、倘使缺乏合宜的運動、適度的陲眠、或缺乏易於消化的食物、或缺乏新鮮的空氣、就要使神經中樞减少效率、其他、對妨礙神經活動的身體缺陷、像目疾·耳病·齒患·鼻疣及鼻塞等、都不應當玩忽、早請醫生治療、</p>
<p>（二）鞭策動機須常引起據康豪塞爾氏的意見、「鞭從的動機」（Adiwing　Motive）、是靑年有效修學的主要條件、是靑年修學的鑰匙、因為一個靑年、倘能具有這種操縱功課强烈的熱望、則對於理智的事情有興味、對於學校的工作有決心、即使從前工作很壞的人、如現在有了這種動機、也必能改變向來懶散冷落、得過目過的態度、而為熱烈的、强毅的努力、使他的前途有希望、</p>
<p>（三）工作環境須切合需耍　工作時的環境狀况、像光綫·溫度·濕度·衣服·棹椅等、都須切合需要、第一要盡力找一個幽靜的房間、去預備功課、冀得免除耳目所招的各種擾亂物、其决、要注意那個房間的光綫·溫度·濕度是吾相宜、光綫千萬不要直接對眼照來、又要免掉書面上反射的閃光、溫度、當以華氏表六十五至六十八度最為相宜、過高或過低、都要使人生各種不安的現象、空氣須流通、但不可吹風、至於緊窄的衣服不宜穿、因其有礙身體的發育和血液的循環、再棹椅的高低、須適合個人的需要、因棹太低、易致肩垂·胸縮·及頭漲等現象、又棹太高、則二臂不適、且易成近視、所以對於棹椅的高低、須各自行審愼配擇、才好、</p>
<p>（四）應用工具須備置齊全「工欲善其事、必先利其器」、靑年求學、也是這樣、當預備功課時、工具要齊全、像鉛筆·橡皮·鋼筆·吸墨紙·十進尺·刀·筆墨·紙張·和字典·辭典·百科全書等、都須備列棹上、使應用時有「一取即得」的便利、</p>
<p>以上所說身體的、精神的物埋的和機械的四種條件、眞是現今靑年求學時所小可缺少的條件、（未完）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>家庭我的家</h3>
<p>— 憤然</p>
<p>我們兄弟五個，合羣而居，巳經有五年了。除開我單身漢住在公共塲所的客堂間以外，其餘的都有妻有子。他們房間分配的辦法是按照長幼决序來決定的。譬如大哥秉着天賦早出世的特權，當然耍佔據一間最好的廂房。那是在二樓正間，朝南坐北，冬暖夏凉，外面還加上一片小小的平台，眞是全幢房屋中最精華的所在。二哥和大哥本是雙胞胎，因爲落地差兩個時辰的緣故，就分派他住在三樓正間。那房間切皆比得上大哥的住房，只是短少了那片狹窄的平台。爲着這一點點的不如意，引起了二哥對大哥種種的嫉恨。三哥叫哥地位更不濟了，他們分別住在二三層亭子間裏面，夏天極熱，冬天極冷，在極冷極熱時候，格外容易感覺到住房分配的不公允。只要有一星星的導火錢，就是一塲鬩牆糾紛。</p>
<p>家裏發生爭執時候，二三四三房因為利害相同緣故，老是站在一邊，成立一個聯合陣綫。大哥被他們駡急了，就拿父命來抵制他們的攻擊，說：住房的分配，以及管理家務權限的賜予，是完全出自父親的命令，並非自己請求而得來的。的確的，父親思想太舊了，五世同堂是他老人家一生的迷夢。是他老人家離　上海，臨行時候，把住房這樣分配下來的；同時還把管理家政一切大權都交給大哥。大哥大權在握，難免作威作福一些，做弟弟的又不肯相讓，自然會無事生非，無風三尺浪了。</p>
<p>我們家裏小孩子眞多，大小一共有十來個，他們都和他們父親一樣，什麽事也不肯幹，整天閑着，專學飛簷走壁的木領，鑽垣竊聽的技能。家裹一有什麽事情發生，無論怎樣秘密　　不出他們的耳目。他們把打聽得來的消息，賣給各人的父母，換得多多少少的賞賜。囚為有道種好處，所以天</p>
<p>亮，他們就成羣結陣的樓上下奔跑着，像煞有介事似的非常的忙碌。我們家房屋的建築　不　分結實，一陣樓梯澎澎的響過以後，承塵上立刻會落下許多灰塵來。特別在吃飯時候，菜上憑空添了許多廉價的味精，眞叫人無法下筷呢！</p>
<p>嫂嫂們也眞會享福，她們每天除吃喝玩樂以外，只思量着如何運用手段，如何挑撥是非；至於　夫敎子治理家事，是不在她們每天課程之內的。像大嫂吧，她在天未大亮的時候，總要吃　碗南棗粥。這種粥是南棗和大米隔夜用文火熬成的。據說常吃非常滋補。我沒有這種經騐，不知道到底功效怎樣。她吃完粥以後，照舊躺下去睡，非全過午是不肯起床的。下牛她的工作是安排到麻雀牌上面去，但無論她在什麽地方打牌，路途怎樣遠，那四點半鐘的燕窩，可不許暫停過一次，到時候總有一個娘姨把大哥親手剔好的燕窩送去給她吃。假若送去的時間稍稍晚了一些，而同時又掽到她賭運不佳，那麼當晚大哥就會被她攪得無法安睡了。二嫂是蘇州人，她有一副很好的聲帶，說起話來，吳儂細語，很是動聽。但駡起人來，就失却這種藝術。她時常放開了喉嚨，大聲跳駡，非至對方屈服是不肯罷休的。她又有一種很不好的習慣，每天飮食無常。不愛吃時候，就是一餐不吃也不在乎：肚子一餓，就恨不得把鷄鴨魚肉以及花生米炙魷魚之類一古腦兒放到肚裹去。因為飮食無常的緣故，使她息上一種極劇烈的胃病。我家附近的藥房，她是個老主顧。三嫂從前是個老槍，現在巳『改邪歸正』了。她極怕熱，夏天是她苦命的日子。天一亮，她老人家就起來了。坐在椅子上，嘴裏喃喃的不知道念的是什麽經。後面照例有　個小丫頭給她槌着背，一下一下的必須快慢劃一，用力適中，稍稍重了一點，小丫頭臉上，就會拍的一聲，賞上一記拖鞋底，火辣辣的痛得眼淚都不敢往下流呢。四嫂年紀最輕，旣貪睡又好酒，每天整整要睡去十六偭鐘頭，其餘的時間就消磨在杯酒之間了。她晚上喝酒時候，她的丈夫孩干們總是圍繞她的左右，報吿給她關於家裹　天所發生的事情。她一而喝着酒，一面思　對付的辦法。她是極工心計的人，有時候想出來的計劃，使人佩服到五體投地呢！</p>
<p>這種腐敗而沒落的家，我實在恨極了。我希望有一天炸彈能在附近廣塲上爆炸起來，使這般醉生夢死的人們有驚醒的一日。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>可怖的死光</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>奧國科學家戴士勒（Nikola　Tesle），現巳八十四歲，渠早年即發明電力機器，於一八八四年下居美國，嗣後即以美國為家，繼續研究電學，發明電力機多種。</p>
<p>最近戴氏為酬答美國友情起見，正在從事造一新的電力機。他稱這新發明的　器爲「電力防空機』（Teleforce），係一種死光，機器開動，電力一經揮時，高空中二百五十英里以內的飛機，觸到時立刻燬為溶液。</p>
<p>這消息是戴氏的至友勞倫斯（W．L．Laurence）發表的，勞倫斯係紐的時報科學欄的主編，所言當不至全屬子虛。據他說，這死光機共包括四種新的發明：（一）用不着眞空，即普通的空氣中亦可發射這光綫；（二）可以發出一種極强烈的電力；（三）可以將這種電力加以擴大；（四）藉一種新方法，產生一種非常猛烈的推進電力。這叫種發明，其中已有兩種試騐成功了。</p>
<p>氏預備將他的新發明貢獻給美國政府，不過他有兩個條件：政府須籌二百萬美金，設一『電力防空機』發動廠（據他說，這廠在三個月之內即可造好）；一切須完全由他經手。假使這計畫成功時，美國在國防上無異添築了一道不可破的長城。所以勞倫斯以為，即使成功希望甚微，也是値得去一試的。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）　愛情結晶品</p>
<p>「你的書大概看得很小少吧？」</p>
<p>「噢……！」湘綺這一問，才把他的注意力從那紙片上移開了。「不錯，這……這都是袁紹文幾年來不斷鼓　的力量。唉！……」說到這裏，一聲短短的感嘆，便由不得他作主的發出來。「所以，我們這件事對於他，委實多少有些說不過去。」</p>
<p>「然而他本人原也是反對他叔父的！」湘綺很乾脆地說：「我雖不敢說他一定可以原諒我們，但道件事對於他，也祇有很少的一些間接的關係，何致就說不過去呢？」</p>
<p>「因為一向做事太謹慎了，現在稍微有一些不謹愼，心裹便不覺胆怯了許多。」秋海棠慢慢地把那支鉛筆放回了筆筒裹去，臉上透着很為難的神氣說。</p>
<p>湘綺正斜坐在床沿上，半個身子靠定了床欄杆，雙手抱住膝蓋，仰起着臉，眼睛看在一行一行的　磚上，大的默想了兩三分鐘。</p>
<p>「胆怯有什麽用？」她並不向秋海棠看，只像自言自語的說：「像我們這種偷偷摸摸的樣子，那兒還談得上謹愼兩個字，簡直隨時隨地都可以給人家說破；到那時候，別說你對袁紹文面上定然弄得大大說小過去，便是我們對於我們自己也何嘗說得過去呢？」</p>
<p>秋海棠垂下了頭，幾乎給她說得毛骨悚然起來。</p>
<p>「現在你父不能就和他辦交涉。」</p>
<p>「話不是這樣說法！」湘綺的眼光，這才從上面的甍磚上移到了他的身上來。「方法也小是死的，反正你家裏並沒有什麽牽掛，我們要走是很容易的事。」</p>
<p>「走到那裹去呢？」他想到自己每决無論上什麽地方去，街上總有人指指點點的在議論他，好像他臉上貼着名字一樣，因此不由不懷疑走到什麽地方才可以沒有人知道。</p>
<p>「天津北京這種大地方當然是不能去的，而且這樣的繁華所在我根本也不歡喜，除了遠一點到南方去之外，近的鄉村也興，你　道沒有家鄕嗎？」</p>

<h3>間諜的秘密</h3>
<p>— 廷鈞</p>
<p>德國政府在納粹的統治下，曾作大規模的直傳運動，極力要使得一班德國人都提。吊膽的去防備間諜。電影院內映影片時，總要先映上一張警吿大衆的畫片，叫大家要各自當心，甚至於連自己最親密的朋友都不可信任，那影片映出一個人面，一個極大的食指擱在嘴脣上面，招呼人：『不要作聲』。</p>
<p>歐洲列强每年用在間諜工作方面的經費，估計當在美金五千萬以上。</p>
<p>李希波（Richebourg），所謂『嬰兒間諜』，生於一七五八年間，此後身體一直像生下來時一般小，不過二英尺畏，這種畸形的身體，到了法國大革命時，却使他變成了無價之寳，因為他到軍隊中充任了一名間諜，此後他時常化裝做嬰孩，令人抱在懷中，携帶了軍事秘密的消　，出入敵軍的防綫。</p>
<p>上决世界大戰時，各國的間諜紛紛將各種情報傳達到所屬的軍隊中，其中最多的，是關於天氣的情報。</p>
<p>上决世界大戰中，間諜們有一個很巧妙的携帶情報的方法，那就是用根烟斗，將情報寫在層層細紙上，裝在烟斗的夾壁間，問諜把烟斗不斷地吸着，遇着情形緊急時，將烟斗輕輕的扭轉一下，情報立刻與烟葉一齊燒掉了。</p>
<p>一九一五年六月間，德國有一個間諜在英國被槍斃了，在他死後的三個月中，德國情報處繼續接到死者寄來的『情報』，雖具名該間諜，但實際上都是一個英國軍官冒名寄的，德國情報處大上　當，被他騙了不少錢去。</p>

<h3>金星上的生物</h3>
<p>— 葉憨</p>
<p>金星距太陽的七千萬英里，係距我們地球最近的一顆行星。新近據大文學家强斯（H．S．Jones）說，金星上的生物或訐正在開始滋生，像地球上幾百萬年以前，最初的原始生物才由海水黏泥中生出來，那種情景相似。</p>
<p>金星的面層雖有很厚的雲霧遮着，但　天文學家用分光鏡研究後，知道金星上业無水蒸氣。强期以爲這或許是因爲那些雲層上面的大氣極其乾燥的原故。金星上面並無游離的氧氣，但是炭氣倒比我們的地面上多。</p>
<p>地球上開始有生物時，那時地面上的炭氣大概也非常多，而氧氣却比較稀少。所以看起來現在的金星倒和幾白萬年以前地球上的情形相似。不過現在金星上即使有生物存在時，也不過是原始的植物而巳。生物或計正在發展，俟再過幾百萬年，地球上的生物已絕跡，那時金星上的生物或許正達到最進化的程度。</p>
<p>火星上以前或許有過極進化的生物，但是現在上面絕對不會有甚麼生物了。因為看到現在火星上面，氧氣與炭氣都沒有。所以强斯說，在這種情形之下，動物是吾可以生　，那是一個疑問。火星與金星上的情形恰相反，現在火星好似地球幾百萬年以後的光景，到那時地上一切生物俱都絕跡，地面上的氣體大都消失了。</p>

<h3>「女人萬歲」主角　琴逑羅吉絲的神秘性</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>琴逑　吉絲近來有兩件事情在使整個好萊塢的人們瞪大了眼睛注視着的：第一，她因主演「女人萬歲」而獲四〇年度的奧司卡金像獎；同男明星詹姆士史蒂華的獲獎一樣，預言家們多少有些失望，因為從來也沒有猜想到他們兩個人去；第二件事情使是琴逑直到現在還不結婚，雖然已和劉亞理士離了婚，琴逑的結婚問題不知怎的使影城熱烈討論。</p>
<p>現在就來談談她的神秘的羅曼史吧。</p>
<p>琴逑在去年三月間和劉亞理士正　仳離，但在事實上，兩人早已分居，離異的眞正原因是誰也不知道，據一般的猜測是琴逑對於劉亞理士在銀幕上默默無聞表示失望。恐怕影響到琴逑自已的前途，所以不願和道樣一個無名小卒同居。</p>
<p>琴逑常常同霍華許士，卡萊葛倫，詹姆士史蒂華，李鮑曼以及勃那尼曼等男朋友玩玩，有時候也　那尙未同白蓓蘭史丹妃結婚的勞勃泰勒同出同進。於是琴逑又成爲　聞記者們的絕好資料，不過她總是說玩玩吧了，還沒有找着理想中的男人。</p>
<p>於是有人說看見琴逑在一個宴會中同劉亞理士立在壁角裏喁喁而語，琴逑走　了亞理士的汽車雙雙駛去了；新聞記者便認為琴逑仍和劉相愛着。但是他倆去年正式的合法離異粉碎了一切的謠言。新聞記者們在法庭外詢問琴逑擬同何人去結婚，他淡然地說：「一年之後再說吧。」</p>
<p>但是整個好萊塢等待她一年了，琴逮沒有喜訊，並且誰也捉摸不定那個男明星是她的正式戀人。相反地，琴逑致力於電影事業並且改變作風了。去年的「枇杷門巷」是她新作風的開端，該片大受美國婦女界歡迎：今年的「女人萬歲」乃奠定了她銀壇上的地位。</p>
<p>羅吉絲的地位現在是同蓓蒂台維絲，嘉寳和瑙瑪希拉一樣了，便也應當有大明星的架子，那就是甚麼事都蒙上一層神秘的色彩。她的旅行日期和目的地連公司裹也不知道的，她並且也不多說話了，不願和外面陌生人多接觸了。</p>
<p>琴逑　吉絲在二址歲時到好萊塢，她有求上進和好勝的性情，對於甚麽事都要弄得非常好，每一部新片總要比前一部優良。在十五歲的時候她脫離了學校，參加當地遊藝表演，她的母親也贊助她和遊歷團訂的之後在大城市中表演。</p>
<p>琴逑終於和茀雷亞期地合作了許多歌舞片：「春華露濃」，「風流艦隊」，「雨打鴛鴦」，「飄飄欲仙」，「舞國帝后」等二十餘片。所以他倆有舞帝舞后之稱，但在前年正式拆夥。</p>
<p>琴逑是使得影城新聞記者摸不着頭腦的一個挺俏皮的女人，她的戀愛是神秘的，她的演技也是神秘的。</p>
<p>據好莢塢電影雜誌上最確切可靠的消息說：她和　華許士的感情還不錯，因為許士送給她的一隻戒指，琴逑止戴在自己手指上呢，這樣看來，她和劉亞理士不能言歸於好了。</p>

<p>李信　是武　，但生平沒有上過戰塲，此刻他　着胆向前迎戰。見土匪如旋風也似的殺到面前，為首紅鬃馬上坐着一個年靑女匯，身穿桃紅色的外褂，桃紅色的戰裙，三寸紅綉鞋，踏在馬鐙上，瘦小不盈一握。頭上紅帕裹自，臉上塗着紅紅的胭脂，手橫雙刀，刀柄子上繫着大紅綵球，望過去上下都紅，好似一樹猩紅灼灼的石榴花，又好似到了火熖山的紅孩兒一般。及至細瞧伊的面龐，幾乎失聲而呼，原來這女匪正是　决相見的那個賣解女佟天鳳。心裏不由一怔。佟天鳳見了李信，便將戰馬初住，滿面春風，帶着笑對李信說道：「眞是巧啊！李公子，你識得我嗎？我就是靑石山上的紅娘子。今番特地前來找你。你若肯隨我回去，我就敎部下停止攻城，保全城中生靈。」李信聽了伊的說話，恐防被杞縣令在城上窺見什麼可疑之處，遂把手中爛銀槍向紅娘子一指道：「呔！誰認識你這女賊？休要口出在言，我就把你擒住，新首示　！」紅娘子見李信對伊無情，也冷笑一聲，說道：一李信，你自以為世家子弟，看輕我們綠林中人嗎？哼！今天你家姑娘　要和你不客氣了。」說罷，揮動手中雙刀，向李信頭上劈來，李信把爛銀槍攔四雙刀，還手　槍，使個銀龍分水，照准紅娘子胸口刺去。紅娘子把左手刀望下一掃，噹的一聲，早將槍格住。李信收轉槍，叉是呼的一槍橫挑到紅娘子的馬前。紅娘于將馬一偏，避過這槍，也把雙刀捲向李　懷裏來。二人各各施展木領，在陣上厮殺。李信平生惟有槍法最是擅長，他學的是楊　槍法，所以紅娘子雖然勇猛，急切間破他不得。心中未免有些焦躁，便將雙刀攔開槍桿，說聲「好厲害」，把馬一扲，跳出圈子，同馬落荒而走。李信以為紅娘子戰敗，正要生擒伊來，顯顯自己的本能，兩腿將馬一夾，在後緊緊追來。　（三二）</p>

<h3>Foreign Relations of the South Are Blocked</h3>
<p>Sulek: Telecommunications between the southern capital and Switzerland are now cut off. Telephone communications between Rome, Berlin, and Switzerland are now limited to national use. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London: All transportation between here and Yugoslavia has not yet been restored. Very little news of the war is coming from the southern nations. Due to the lack of information from the southern capital and Germany's efforts to disseminate information, it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of the progress of the German offensive. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department announced late last night that the U.S. authorities have not been able to contact the U.S. Embassy in the south. This is probably due to the bombing of the city by German planes, which has completely cut off communication with the outside world. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Southeastern Europe Becomes More Serious: Anglo-Greek Forces Bravely Resist; German Official Claims to Have Broken Through the Greek Border; Rumor Has It That Yugoslavia Has Moved Its Capital to Florence</h3>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland: After the Nazi war machine shattered the borders of both Yugoslavia and Greece at dawn yesterday, it encountered fierce resistance from the combined forces of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Britain fighting shoulder to shoulder. At present, no direct news can be obtained from the capitals of Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Italy, while Nazi and Fascist radio stations are promoting the Axis powers' news all day long, boasting that after three air raids on the southern capital, it has become a "sea of flames." However, they admit to encountering stubborn resistance, especially from the Greek army in the Struma River valley. It is believed that Hitler has mobilized 500,000 troops for this operation, while the opposing side has 1 million Yugoslav troops and an unspecified number of British and Greek troops. Hitler's strategy is largely similar to that used in the pacification of Poland. German radio stations insist that the Yugoslav government did indeed flee Belgrade before it was bombed. Unconfirmed reports here say that Bulgarian troops are cooperating with German forces in the two strongholds of Thrace and the Struma Valley to fight against Greece. Some people here have heard that Romanian troops may also join the fighting. Croatia (northern Yugoslavia), Zagreb, and Ljubljana have been declared undefended cities. Observers acknowledge that the two cities may fall into German hands, as they are both located on plains with no defenses. Diplomats in Zurich heard that the Yugoslav cabinet moved from the capital to Florence, about 70 miles north of Scutari, while other government officials went to Kak, about 65 miles south of the capital. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>London: Ankara Radio in Turkey reported that the German army's target in attacking Yugoslavia is Niš, and the route into Greece is along the Struma River valley. Niš is in eastern Yugoslavia, near the Bulgarian border. The Struma River valley leads from Bulgaria into Greece. The German army is divided into three divisions attacking the Yugoslav capital Belgrade from Romania, two mechanized divisions and one infantry division attacking the southern capital from Szeged in Hungary, and twelve to fourteen divisions operating on the Austro-Yugoslav border attacking Zagreb. This is enough to show that the German troops used are far more numerous than needed to cut the Yugoslav army into two parts. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Ankara: A Turkish military source stated that the German army's first military objective is to gain a foothold between Greece and Yugoslavia in order to maintain contact with the Italian army and to seize control of the "Southern Capital, Niš, Skopje" railway. The same source also stated that the German army has 14 divisions in Bulgaria. They estimate that the strength of the German air force in both Bulgaria and Romania is 1,700 aircraft, including 615 fighters, 75 reconnaissance planes, and the rest bombers. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy: After the German army invaded Yugoslavia this morning, military observers here stated that the German offensive against the southern nation will proceed along the railway between the capitals of Yugoslavia and Hungary, from northeast to southwest. The Yugoslav army is unlikely to resist resolutely, and even the southern capital may not want to defend itself, as its only chance of a decisive battle is to retreat to the Mediterranean coast and join forces with the Greek army. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London: German radio reported that German forces have crossed the borders of both Serbia and Greece and are making contact with enemy forces everywhere, advancing according to plan, unhindered by treacherous terrain and enemy resistance. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command stated that German forces have penetrated 18 to 24 miles into Greece and Yugoslavia. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to indirect news from the front, German stormtroopers crossed the river and reached the Yugoslav border at 4:00 AM this morning. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials admitted today that the task facing the German forces attacking the borders of Greece and Yugoslavia is the most serious since the start of the European war. The German side does not hide that the Serbs are the most tenacious fighters in Europe. The mountainous highlands of southern Serbia and northern Greece are best suited for defense, so the German Panzer divisions will have no opportunity for rapid operations. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Zurich): At 6:55 PM last night, this station received an announcement from the Greek radio station: "The Yugoslav government has announced its withdrawal from the southern capital." Berlin radio also reported that German troops are advancing on all fronts in Greece. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital: News has been received from diplomatic circles here that the morale of the Yugoslav army is very high. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Southern Nation Accuses Germany of Aggression; Resolves to Resist Unreasonable Attack; Southern Ambassador Holds Important Talks with Britain</h3>
<p>London: Swiss radio broadcast a declaration from the Southern Nation's Embassy in Vichy, stating, "The Southern Nation is determined to defend its independence, territorial integrity, and honor, and to resist this unreasonable attack. Germany is the aggressor. The Southern Nation has not behaved in a way that is hostile to Germany. The real reason for Germany's actions can be seen in Germany's desire to make the Southern Nation abandon its neutrality." The Southern Nation's Ambassador to London, Sopotik, recently told a Reuters reporter, "It is even more shocking that the German authorities have ordered the German army to treat our compatriots with barbaric means. During the last Great War, Serbs and Germans were enemies, but both sides showed mutual respect and abided by the rules of war. It is quite surprising that the German commander-in-chief now deems it necessary to issue this order. In any case, the people of the Southern Nation do not want war, but they also have the courage to accept the challenge. We have a military and historical reputation that is in no way inferior to that of Germany. To say that the Southern Nation is belligerent is to turn the facts upside down, as the Southern Nation did its best to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula until the very last moment." The Southern Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office yesterday and held talks with British government representatives for a long time. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London: Due to the German attack on Yugoslavia and Greece, British military and civilian officials held several emergency meetings yesterday. However, observers learned that during recent negotiations between Britain and the United States, the possibility of a German attack on Yugoslavia and Greece was discussed, and adjustments to the overseas supply of the two countries were considered. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>New York: CBS broadcast a special address from the BBC to Yugoslavia today, promising assistance. The address stated, "Germany, without any provocation, has committed barbaric atrocities against Yugoslavia. The heroic resistance of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes places Britain and Yugoslavia on the same front. We welcome the Southern Nation as a determined and powerful allied country, and we are re-establishing our friendship. This friendship enabled us to overcome difficulties and achieve victory in the last Great War. We will fight together until justice is vindicated and law and justice are re-established before peace can be concluded." (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Ljubljana: The mayor of this city recently delivered a widespread speech to the city's people, stating, "A curfew will be implemented in this city immediately. It is hoped that all citizens will strictly abide by it. Do not lightly believe alarmist rumors. Our army is fighting on the border and is confident of victory." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Southern Capital Bombed Four Times; Italy Claims Joint Action with Germany; Romania and Bulgaria Attacked by Southern Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command received news that German bombers, dive bombers, fighters, and destroyers attacked military targets in the Southern Nation yesterday. The Southern Capital was heavily bombed three times, and large fires broke out everywhere, which had not been extinguished by evening. The area near the railway station was severely damaged, and multiple bombs were dropped on several airfields, and they were also bombarded by artillery fire. In the afternoon, German planes carried out a second heavy bombing of the Southern Capital, attacking important military targets, and large fires broke out everywhere. From 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the Southern Capital was attacked for the third time, hitting several Southern Nation aircraft. In total, 35 enemy aircraft were shot down in the day's air battles, and 48 enemy aircraft were destroyed in the airfields. The railway center northwest of Zagreb was also hit by several bombs and completely destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: An official here stated this afternoon that German planes made a fourth heavy bombing of Belgrade last night, the same as the previous three times, and were successful. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German planes yesterday destroyed a pontoon bridge east of the Southern Nation's capital. The bridge was newly built and was prepared for troop transport, with special military importance. The shops and building materials near the bridge were also destroyed. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government announced last night its decision to attack the Southern Nation. According to a Berlin communiqué, Italian planes had bombed military targets in the southern part of the Southern Nation before this official announcement. The Italian official announcement, after stating the suffering Italy has endured, said that Italy, in view of these facts, has decided to take maritime, land, and air actions in close coordination with Germany. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian Air Force bombed Yugoslav bases in the Adriatic Sea yesterday, with the port of Split being the main target of the attack, causing multiple fires. The Mostar airfield was hit and suffered heavy losses. The port facilities, warehouses, and ships docked in the port of Cattaro were also hit. Italian reconnaissance planes were active in the Adriatic Sea all day yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>New York: CBS broadcast a British radio report that the Southern Yugoslav Air Force had bombed Romania. This has been announced by the Romanian Council of State.

<h3>U.S. Air Force in the Philippines Conducts Large-Scale Exercises; Key British and Dutch Figures to Meet in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila: Twenty-six newly arrived U.S. destroyers exercised here this morning, in the largest U.S. Air Force demonstration in Philippine history. The aircraft squadron performed in the Manila, Camp Keithley, and Fort Stotsenburg triangle area yesterday, as the United States celebrated Armed Forces Day. British Far East Commander-in-Chief Admiral Brooke Popham and Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens will arrive here on the 8th to hold important meetings with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre. Dutch officials who have arrived here from Batavia to welcome the Dutch Foreign Minister are unwilling to comment on the nature of the future meeting. Sayre also refused to speak, and also refused to reveal the content of his talks with Brooke Popham here last week, saying only that the talks were of a "completely private" nature. He also said that the Dutch, British, and American meeting may last for several days, and said that this Army Memorial Day has great significance, because the United States is now working hard to build its own defense, while also having to assist Britain and other democratic countries to resist the unprecedented barbarous attack that is destroying civilization. Therefore, April 7th will make the people under the American flag have a more profound sense of gratitude for the protection of our army, at a time when this world is full of chaos and conflict.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Balkan War</h3>
<p>Over the past few days, the international situation has continuously presented several new forms, which, rather than being regarded as drastic changes, should be regarded as a linear and inevitable development, with no surprises in between. On the same day that Germany and Italy announced their invasion of Yugoslavia, British troops in East Africa defeated the Italian army and entered Addis Ababa, creating the opportunity for Abyssinian King Haile Selassie to return to his homeland and restore his country; within Abyssinia, there are still many remnants of the Italian army, which, if not for their low morale, are still numerous enough to put up a desperate fight, so the East African war has not yet ended, that is, Abyssinia has not yet been cleared; but Italy's attempt to revitalize its military power and turn defeat into victory, at least in East Africa, can be inferred to be hopeless, and the restoration of the Abyssinian king can be inferred to be a certainty of eighteen or nineteen chances out of ten; Haile Selassie's country was destroyed and he fled to Britain and France in 1936; five years later, today, witnessing the decline of the violent powers, it can be said that this day should have come, which is truly exciting, but not unexpected.</p>
<p>The expansion of the European war to the Balkans was inevitable from the start; ever since Italy launched its invasion of Greece and Greece rose up to resist, the Balkans has not only been filled with the smell of gunpowder, but can be said to have been engulfed in flames, so how could the countries of the peninsula remain aloof? Therefore, it is not unexpected that Yugoslavia has finally been drawn into the vortex. What can be regarded as unexpected is that the southern nation is only now involved, and that Bulgaria and Romania, outside of the southern nation, although they have been trampled and lost their freedom, are still clinging to the old and preserving the obsolete, neither seizing the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and rise up to strengthen themselves, nor helping the tyrant to do evil, and exerting their function as claws and teeth; and even more so Turkey, not only is there a question about its treaty obligations, but also, in terms of factual threats, at least since the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia, it should no longer be able to feign ignorance, but unexpectedly maintains its neutral status to this day. All unexpected things are often determined by common sense and constant principles. According to yesterday's news reports, Turkey sympathizes with Greece and Yugoslavia and implies that the limit of its neutrality is that Bulgaria should not throw stones down the well at Greece and the southern nation; at the same time, it is also reported that Greece has repelled the attacking German army at a certain location and launched a counterattack in Bulgarian territory; after accepting the challenge, Yugoslavia's air force has flown to Romania, which is under German control, and bombed the oil fields; these movements show that the scope of the war in the Balkans is accelerating and continuing to expand, and that the countries that are still standing on the edge of the vortex today will soon be unable to stay in the current stage for long. In short, they will all become members of the great war.</p>
<p>This was originally regarded as unexpected: in the Greek resistance against Italy, although British aid to Greece was public, the British military strength that had infiltrated Greece was still an open secret; until the day before yesterday, when Germany and Italy declared war on Yugoslavia and Germany on Greece at the same time, British troops officially appeared in Greece, and thus there was a three-nation Allied force of Britain, Greece, and Yugoslavia in the Balkans, which is a new posture. From the public joint operations of the three countries of Britain, Greece, and Yugoslavia, new questions were immediately triggered in terms of legal principles and methods, that is, how should Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan be interpreted? At the time of the Italian-Greek war, it could still be attributed to another event outside of the alliance, and Germany and Japan deliberately dodged this question and went their separate ways. Now that Greece and Yugoslavia are openly fighting alongside the enemy countries of the Tripartite Pact, how can it still be explained as being unrelated to the Tripartite Pact? If it cannot be explained as being unrelated, then what will ally Japan do to Yugoslavia, and what will it do to Britain?</p>
<p>Pursuing explanations is not a leisure activity of nitpicking, nor is it the pedantry of an academician; but rather to discern the morality, reason, spirit, and value of the Tripartite Pact, to discern everything related to the Tripartite Pact; and also to discern what achievements the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, who advocated collusion with Germany and Italy and strengthening the alliance, and who had just completed his visit to Germany and Italy and spoke loudly and vehemently, has made in this trip, and how it will affect everything of the alliance. Therefore, we are happy to hear verbal explanations and happy to see factual explanations. By inference, Matsuoka will return empty-handed and will remain silent and not give any direct explanation! To explain, we still have to wait and see how the Balkan war develops and how it comes to an end. If Germany and Italy have remarkable military achievements in the Balkans and gain an overwhelming victory, it will certainly allow the glory and momentum of the Tripartite Pact to rise again. Victory and defeat are common occurrences, who can know in advance; and since the surrender of France, the Western European war situation has stagnated, and the land combat forces of Britain and Germany have not had the opportunity to compete; the German army, which did win repeatedly in the early stages of the war, has not shown its skills for a long time; recently, in Libya, the German army aided the Italian counteroffensive, forcing the Allied forces to abandon Benghazi, but it can only be regarded as a local skirmish in the great war, differing in nature from a direct operation by the main forces: therefore, how the morale and strength of the German side compare to the early stages of the war, and how the British will fare after having experience in confronting the new German tactics, in the battlefields of the Balkan War from now on, should all be left as questions and await factual answers. This battle is related to the prestige of Britain, to the temporary fortunes and misfortunes of Greece and the southern nation, and to Germany and Italy it is different. Because of the nature of the Balkan War, if Germany and Italy are defeated, Nazism and Fascism will be like the setting sun, collapsing at once, and even if the great war cannot end immediately, the final outcome can be said to be decided, so this battle is a decisive battle for Germany and Italy; if the Allied forces of Britain, Greece, and the southern nation are defeated, the fate of Greece and the southern nation will be like France in the past ten months, or even like Abyssinia in the past five years, suffering all kinds of torment and hardship, which is naturally expected, but Britain will never give up from this, and will continue to work hard, with vigor unabated, so for Britain it is not a decisive battle; in other words, the overall war situation, as well as the fate of Britain, Greece, and the southern nation, and even France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and other countries, will not be decided by the Balkan War, that is, the Balkan War has no decisive effect on the democratic countries. However, the victory or defeat will inevitably affect another aspect of the international situation, and Japan is not the only one watching.</p>
<h3>The Fierce Fighting in the Struma River Valley; German and Greek Forces Clash Violently; The German Offensive Against Salonica is Obstructed; 600,000 British Troops Arrive in Greece to Assist in the War</h3>
<p>British Supreme Commander in Greece, Wavell</p>
<p>London – With the assistance of British, Australian, and New Zealand troops, the Greek army is fighting valiantly. The German offensive against Salonica has essentially come to a standstill. According to a Greek military spokesman, the German army has repeatedly attacked along the Bulgarian border but has been repelled each time. All the Greek fortifications have put up successful resistance, although one position was lost after a fierce German assault. The Greek army destroyed ten German tanks, and Greek fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down six German planes. In addition, some German troops were captured. A squadron of British Air Force Hurricane fighters shot down five German Messerschmitt Bf 109s, and all the British planes returned safely to base. Today, the Greek side announced that several areas have been evacuated according to plan to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. After some initial progress, the enemy advance has been halted along the entire front. The main route of the German offensive along the Greek-Bulgarian border passes through the Rhodope Mountains, with the key route being the Struma River valley, leading directly to Xanthe, 50 miles northwest of Salonica. Originally, the direct route to Salonica passed through the Vardar River valley in Yugoslavia, but due to Yugoslavia’s resistance, this route is no longer available to the Germans. The German side has openly acknowledged the strength of the Anglo-Greek resistance. The spirit of the Greek people is high, and large numbers are flocking to the General Staff in Athens to volunteer for service. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens – The Greek General Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that strong German forces, with the latest weapons and supported by tanks, heavy artillery, and a large number of aircraft, launched attacks on our army’s positions along the Bulgarian border at dawn yesterday, dividing their forces and launching numerous assaults. The Greek army and air force, outnumbered, fought bravely, and the battle raged throughout the day, especially fiercely in the Struma River valley. Only one position along the entire front was captured. Ten enemy tanks were destroyed by our forces, and five or six enemy planes were shot down. To avoid unnecessary sacrifice, our forces have retreated from certain positions to pre-determined defensive lines. By nightfall, the enemy offensive had been halted. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>London – According to the German official news agency, British and German troops have made contact on the Greek-Bulgarian border. The German advance is encountering strong resistance, especially in the Struma River valley. However, the German side is reportedly satisfied with the news received so far. According to an announcement by the Athens radio, the forward units of the Greek army on the eastern front are holding their positions everywhere. According to news from Vichy regarding the Bulgarian border, German planes bombed Salonica yesterday. The German radio’s statement that the German army encountered strong resistance in the Struma River valley should not be interpreted as the German army having deeply penetrated Greek territory, as the Struma River valley is partly in Bulgaria, and the German army would naturally encounter strong resistance when entering Greece from there. German radio broadcasts reports from eyewitnesses describing the difficulties of the German advance along the valley, stating that the Germans must use all their organizational capabilities to overcome the obstacles of the mountains and climate. German soldiers must erect markers along the mountain roads to warn motorized units of dangerous locations. German engineers are now blasting rocks to build roads to facilitate the movement of heavy vehicles. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin – It has been learned from responsible authorities here that the German advance into the Struma River valley is encountering strong resistance from Greek troops, but military reports indicate that the German advance is still progressing smoothly. The Struma River flows from Bulgaria into Greece at Xanthi, and then into the Aegean Sea east of the Chalkidiki Peninsula. The city of Salonica is located west of the peninsula. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>New York – According to unconfirmed reports from Ankara, the Greek army has counter-attacked and repulsed the German forces, and is fighting in some areas within Bulgarian territory. This news was broadcast by a correspondent for Columbia Broadcasting System in Ankara. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens – A Greek communiqué claims that Greek forces destroyed ten German tanks and shot down six German planes yesterday. All Greek artillery batteries, except for one, resisted heavy bombardment and aerial attacks. Greek forces have abandoned some territory but have halted the enemy on the front lines. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens – Last night, a spokesman for the Greek Ministry of Information stated that it was expected that the Greek army would only be able to resist the German forces for two hours, but unexpectedly, it has resisted for twelve hours and maintained an unbroken front against an enemy ten times stronger. The concentrated German attacks have encountered devastating artillery fire. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London – The British government announced yesterday that British Empire troops have been stationed in Greece. "The troops sent to Greece include soldiers from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. The Royal Air Force has greatly strengthened Greek defenses." General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Command, is now the Supreme Commander of British forces in Greece. The decision to send a large British force to Greece was proposed to the War Cabinet by Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Dill, and subsequently approved by the Cabinet. However, since that decision was implemented, the situation in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean has changed dramatically, with German mechanized forces suddenly appearing in large numbers in Libya, forcing British forces to withdraw from Benghazi. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of supporting Yugoslavia, which is a very strong move recently, although the Soviet Union has not indicated that it will provide material assistance to Yugoslavia as it did to China and the former Spanish government. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Istanbul – According to reliable sources here, the number of British troops landing in Greece is approximately 600,000. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>London – British newspaper commentators have warned the Allied nations that their initial battles in the Balkans may result in retreats due to the lack of sufficient British troops and supplies. However, they also state that this situation can be quickly remedied. Informed British sources say that the initial deployment of British troops to Greece was mutually agreed upon by the Greek and British General Staffs, but the current British forces in Greece are not yet sufficient to constitute full British assistance. Therefore, newspaper commentators suggest that the initial stages of the war in Yugoslavia may face setbacks but believe that the British troops sent to Greece will not repeat the experience of Norway a year ago. The commentators warn of impending difficulties and believe that Prime Minister Churchill may deliver an early report to Parliament. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>King George's Address to the Nation: Fight Shoulder-to-Shoulder with Yugoslavia; Absolutely Fearless of Hardship and Suffering; With British and American Aid, Victory is Assured; Greek Commander-in-Chief Encourages Subordinates to Devote Themselves to Overcoming the Enemy</h3>
<p>Athens – King George of Greece, General Papagos, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and the Greek government each issued statements last night, emphatically declaring their determination to fight until final victory is achieved. General Papagos issued a general order to Greek troops on the front lines, encouraging them to fight with the same dedication as the Greek troops on the Albanian front. The order also earnestly mentions "our armed brothers, the British army," and states, "We are determined to resist and conquer the enemy, just as we have conquered numerous other enemies." King George issued a proclamation to the people regarding the German attack on Greece, stating, "With God's help, we will prevail. The Greek people have proven to the world that they value honor above all else and will resist the new enemy with honor to the end. Although Greece is small, its spirit is great. Now attacked by another country, we will not allow that country to destroy it. Our struggle will be difficult and painful, but we will not be afraid. We will endure hardship and suffering and will not shrink from any sacrifice. Victory awaits us in the future, and then Greece will once again gain lasting glory. Greece now has two powerful allies: the British Empire, with its indomitable spirit, and the United States, with its limitless resources. We will also fight shoulder-to-shoulder with our Yugoslavian brothers, shedding our blood together to save the entire Balkan Peninsula and humanity. With God's help, we will prevail."</p>
<p>The Greek Government Encourages the Nation</p>
<p>The Greek government also issued a proclamation urging the military and civilians to fulfill their duties to the nation in the face of German aggression. The proclamation states, "The German Minister visited the Prime Minister this morning, informing him on behalf of the German government that German troops would attack Greece. At the same time, news was received from the border that the German side had carried out its threats. At dawn on April 6, 1941, the Axis powers repeated the Italian aggression of October 28, 1940. Greece's glorious destiny and sovereignty have been met with this new aggression. The government, therefore, urges all military and civilians to fulfill their duties to their beloved motherland, to exert their strength, courage, and perseverance, to deeply understand the righteousness of their cause, to invoke God's blessings, and to protect our brave and great allies." This proclamation was signed by Prime Minister Koryzis and all members of the government. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>All of Greece is Filled with Patriotic Sentiment</p>
<p>(Athens) According to the latest news from the border, large numbers of Greek troops, determined to defend their country, are moving into newly prepared positions. As they marched to the front lines, they shouted, "Long live our country, long live our King, long live our army, God bless us." The people of Macedonia and Serres, most directly affected, showed great enthusiasm. Yesterday, when King George and Prime Minister Koryzis traveled through the streets of Athens by car, the people cheered enthusiastically. Subsequently, many people held non-violent demonstrations, going to the General Staff to volunteer for service on the front lines. The people of Salonica also marched in formation to the British and Yugoslav consulates, cheering before signing their names. Upon hearing the news of the German attack throughout Greece, the people's shared hatred of the enemy was unprecedentedly fervent. Soon after, patriotic parades were held everywhere, traversing all the streets.</p>
<p>Prayers in Churches to Repel the Enemy</p>
<p>Churches are filled with prayers to repel the second enemy as they repelled the first. And the people everywhere hold great confidence. Upon hearing news of the German invasion, they were extraordinarily calm. Greek troops on the Albanian front, upon receiving the news, also showed great enthusiasm, deeply believing that they would defeat the new enemy, singing the national anthem, and cheering for the King and the country. In military hospitals, wounded soldiers who could get out of bed all left their beds to sing the national anthem. In front of the British military headquarters in Athens, crowds gathered, shouting, "We will win." Youth groups marched in formation, and large crowds stood outside the headquarters, watching important figures enter and exit. Special editions of newspapers were eagerly purchased by the public, all wanting to be the first to see them. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>London – A dispatch from Athens by the Independent French News Agency reports that the Greek cabinet met yesterday morning, and Greek banks have limited withdrawals, allowing depositors to withdraw 5% of their deposits each month, up to a limit of 10,000 drachmas. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Fully Sympathizes with Yugoslavia's Position; Because its Measures Conform to the Principles of Peace; The Soviet-Yugoslav Pact is Definitely Not a Formal Document</h3>
<p>Moscow – The newspaper "Izvestia" published an article entitled "A Document to Consolidate Peace," stating, "The signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia fully conforms to the wishes of the people of both countries. Judging from the past experiences of the Soviet Union, this type of pact is not just a formal document, but can, in fact, consolidate peace. We must realize that this agreement was signed at a time when the war is expanding, a war that has already affected hundreds of millions of people and will continue to involve more lives in a bloody tragedy. This point is especially sufficient to show the importance of the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement. The Soviet Union cannot help but sympathize with the Yugoslav government's efforts to maintain peace and enhance its foreign standing, as all actions aimed at peace conform to the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Now, this common desire for peace has been translated into a diplomatic document. There is no doubt that the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement concluded yesterday will certainly be supported by the people of Yugoslavia, and it will also be approved by the great Soviet people. This important document is a new expression of Stalin's peace policy and conforms to the interests of all countries striving for peace." (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact, "Pravda" commented, "The day of the signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav friendship and non-aggression pact is not only a milestone in the development of friendly relations between the two countries but also shows that the two governments have jointly strived to enhance peace and prevent the expansion of war. In order to adhere to the policy of peace, the Soviet Union has firmly followed Stalinism. The signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia fully conforms to the basic principles of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Recent events in Yugoslavia have fully demonstrated that the people of Yugoslavia are indeed striving for peace and do not want their country to be dragged into war. In meetings and demonstrations, the people of Yugoslavia have made it clear that, in the history of international relations, the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact will become a special document of peace and a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's struggle for peace. The Soviet people will give it their enthusiastic support." (TASS, 7th)</p>
<h3>Britain and America are Excited by the Signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav Pact</h3>
<p>London – Responsible circles in London regard the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression pact as an extremely exciting development, and Washington shares this view. According to news received here, Under Secretary of State Welles in Washington told people that he felt particularly interested in this agreement. Many people feel the same way. This agreement has great significance and will definitely excite Greece and Yugoslavia, and it is also quite important for Turkey. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London – British Home Secretary Morrison commented on Germany's declaration of war on Yugoslavia and Greece last night in Nottingham, saying that he hopes Turkey understands that the time has come to make decisions concerning the safety and security of the entire Balkan region. The Soviet-Yugoslav mutual non-aggression pact is most welcome. Although we should not overemphasize it, if this indicates a shift in Soviet policy, it would be fortunate not only for Europe but also for the Soviet Union. He believes that Hitler will encounter forces he does not want to see in the Balkans. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Sydney – Australian Foreign Minister Steward stated today that Australia will, in accordance with Churchill's guarantee, assist Yugoslavia and Greece with all its resources to the extent possible.

Australian newspapers have strongly condemned Hitler's recent actions. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>The U.S. Government Expresses Assistance to Yugoslavia in Resisting Aggression; Supplying its Needs with Various Military Supplies; And Using Seized Danish Ships for Transportation</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull, who met with President Roosevelt last night, announced that the U.S. government is proceeding as quickly as possible with the supply of military and other supplies to Yugoslavia. The savage invasion of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers, with the aim of annihilating it by force, is another scene in the Axis powers' plan to conquer the world. Now there is another weak country being invaded by force, showing that the Axis powers' actions to conquer the world are endless and without earthly or other limits. The American people express great sympathy for Yugoslavia, which has been attacked without cause. We are now watching with ardent emotion the courageous struggle of the Yugoslav people to defend their country and protect their freedom. The U.S. government, in accordance with its policy of assisting those who defend themselves and resist aggression, is now transporting military and other supplies to Yugoslavia as quickly as possible within the realm of possibility. Hull has instructed the U.S. mission in the Yugoslav capital to continue operating, but has informed the mission to preferably stay with the Yugoslav government. The news of Germany's declaration of war on Yugoslavia was briefly mentioned in a short cable from the Yugoslav capital received by the New York Times, which stated that at 2:35 a.m., the air raid alarm sounded in the Yugoslav capital, which was the first indication that Yugoslavia had entered a state of war. Shortly after, two Yugoslav fighter planes appeared in the sky over the Yugoslav capital, flying east. A little later, two more planes followed. Radio communications in the Yugoslav capital have now been interrupted. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles reviewed the situation in Yugoslavia yesterday. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Fotitch, also met with Welles today. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull, Under Secretary of State Welles, and Assistant Secretary of State Berle worked overtime in their offices all day Sunday. The White House also maintained close contact with foreign affairs intelligence. The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States had a long conversation with Welles yesterday. Observers are closely watching the British clearing out of Italian forces in East Africa, as the United States has expressed its intention to shorten the war zone and allow ships to sail into that area. However, the shipping routes have not yet been determined. It is said that President Roosevelt has already obtained a blueprint of the items needed by Yugoslavia in recent consultations with the Yugoslav Ambassador. Senator George, a Democratic Senator from Georgia and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Turkey may soon be drawn into the war, and that Germany's invasion this time, disregarding waging war on two fronts simultaneously, is the last measure to maintain Germany's dignity. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Authoritative sources here revealed last night that the U.S. plans to use the seized Danish ships, valued at $23 million, to accelerate aid to the Balkans. The government is planning to place the Danish ships under legal control so that they can be used by the government as soon as possible. A government official pointed out that these thirty-nine Danish fast ships could transport all the supplies that the United States could provide to the Balkan countries under the Lend-Lease Act to the Balkans. A spokesman for the Danish Embassy said that Denmark would be happy to respond, which is tantamount to urging the U.S. government to requisition the ships immediately. (International News Service, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – It is understood that a large number of armaments have been shipped from the United States to Yugoslavia, and according to the State Department, assistance will also be provided to Greece in addition to providing supplies to Yugoslavia. According to President Roosevelt's announcement last week, France has a large number of field guns stored in the United States, which will be transported to Greece. At present, there are many Yugoslav ships anchored in American ports, which can quickly transport armaments back to the country. As for the types of armaments, since most of the output of American aircraft factories is shipped to the United Kingdom, it is not possible to supply Yugoslavia with aircraft at this time. Therefore, these armaments will mostly be limited to rifles, machine guns, ammunition, and bombs. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Fotitch, told reporters yesterday that the people of Yugoslavia will resist to the end, no matter what difficulties they encounter, and are deeply grateful for the U.S. government's efforts to help. In addition, the Greek Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Pous, also made similar remarks. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>New York – Eleven prominent Americans of German origin jointly sent a telegram to Yugoslav Prime Minister General Simović, congratulating Yugoslavia on its position of striving for independence. The signatories included former German Minister of the Interior Solmann, Dr. Goss, a professor at Princeton University, and the well-known journalist Villard. According to their spokesman, Dr. Belloni, this telegram was actually addressed to the entire people of Yugoslavia. The telegram reads, "Millions of Americans of German origin oppose Hitlerism, uphold freedom, and support the consistent position of the Yugoslav people in striving for independence and resisting Nazi aggression. We are especially excited about the actions of Yugoslavs of German origin in supporting Your Excellency." (Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Troops Capture Addis Ababa: Encounter Minimal Resistance; Italian Empire Nearing Total Collapse; British Vanguard Advances North of Addis Ababa Towards Dessie</h3>
<p>Cairo - British troops in Abyssinia are advancing rapidly, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The vanguard occupied Addis Ababa last night (established as the capital of Abyssinia in 1696). It is reported that there was no fighting when British troops entered Addis Ababa. South African forces have been pursuing victoriously since crossing the Awash River on Saturday and Sunday, encountering no resistance. A Cairo military spokesman stated today that the capture of Addis Ababa does not mean the complete conquest of Abyssinia, as there are still large Italian forces in the region that have not surrendered. It is believed here and in London that Italian Commander Aosta has received direct orders from Hitler to take action to tie down British forces in Africa as much as possible. The fighting in Eritrea is also coming to an end, as it is reported that Free French patrols have reached within eight miles of Massawa (a key Italian port along the Red Sea). The Queen of Abyssinia, who is currently in London, upon hearing the good news of the British troops reaching Addis Ababa, her private secretary stated, "Abyssinia, the first to suffer the disaster of totalitarian aggression, has now regained its freedom. The Queen is overjoyed and grateful to God and the British Empire." When Addis Ababa was about to fall, it was bombed by British air force and South African aircraft. Public announcements stated that the airfield, hangars, and barracks there were hit by heavy bombs, causing large fires. After the British planes finished bombing, they strafed enemy planes on the ground, destroying four enemy bombers and damaging several others. Enemy fighter planes attempted to intercept British planes but were quickly repelled. Enemy transport vehicles southeast of Addis Ababa were also heavily bombed, suffering severe damage. On the 4th of this month, British planes carried out a night raid on the barracks, storage depots, and power plant in Tripoli, all of which were hit by heavy bombs, causing fires. All British planes returned safely. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>London - The War Office issued a public announcement today stating, "Before British troops entered Addis Ababa yesterday, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, Duke Aosta, sent a letter through an Italian messenger to British Generals Cunningham and Wavell, expressing his gratitude for the two generals' advance steps to protect the women and children of Addis Ababa, and stating that the humanitarian connection between Italy and Britain could be clearly demonstrated here." (Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The Italian colonial empire is declining daily. Except for the port of Massawa on the Red Sea, which is now virtually under the control of British, Imperial, and Free French forces, all Italian forces have been driven out in several inland battles. British and Imperial forces have advanced to Addis Ababa within ten weeks with irresistible force. When the Italian forces captured it years ago, it took them five months, and the resistance they faced was from a defenseless people. The Italian forces retreated even before being driven out. The first to arrive in Addis Ababa were South African troops. The waters off the port of Massawa are now full of British warships, monitoring German and Italian ships attempting to escape. The Daily Telegraph's comments seem to sum up everything, saying, "The death knell of Mussolini's empire has sounded. The British side will be able to draw more troops to Africa or Macedonia to fight the Nazis." (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo - According to an official announcement, on the evening of April 5, our vanguard reached Addis Ababa. The Governor-General and government agencies had already left. As a result of the surrender documents dropped by our planes on April 1, a special envoy from the Italian Governor-General of East Africa flew to our lines on the 3rd. Our troops presented various conditions to him and promised to guarantee the safety of the civilian population there in case of fighting near Addis Ababa. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A military spokesman recently stated that the South African troops who occupied Addis Ababa have advanced north to Dessie, leaving only a garrison to defend Addis Ababa. There was no fighting during the occupation of Addis Ababa. The eleven-week offensive has come to an end, and the East African empire that Italy had been building for seventy years has also collapsed. When South African troops entered the city, thick smoke was still rising from the English bombing. The Italian troops led by Duke Aosta have fled north to Gondar and Dessie. It is possible that the Italian army will put up a last stand in Dessie. It is estimated that there are still 40,000 Italians in Abyssinia. South African troops are advancing along the Djibouti Railway into Addis Ababa. Observers believe that there must still be 70,000 Italian troops left in Abyssinia, waiting for the British to eliminate them. South African troops advanced 30 English miles on Saturday when they attacked Addis Ababa in one day and night. King Selassie is personally leading troops to attack the Italian base of Debra Marcos, 100 English miles north of Addis Ababa. South of Addis Ababa, British troops are advancing from Enkel and Javello. The number of Italian prisoners is increasing rapidly. An entire Italian unit was captured in Agota, 25 English miles east of Adua. The Italian army was fleeing towards Dessie and Asseb. Another British army is advancing towards Massawa.

<h3>Emergency Report: Beware of Counterfeits! Strange Phenomenon in Suzhou Society; Shops Operate Without Signs; Old Suzhou Customers Need No Explanation; New Customers Please Register at the Reception Desk</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Suzhou) The Caizhizhai Confectionery at the entrance of Zhushi Lane in Guanyuan, Suzhou, was founded hundreds of years ago. The sweets and candied fruits sold there are all made according to ancestral secret recipes and personally supervised, and they are famous far and wide, with a good reputation. Initially managed by the eldest brother, he suddenly resigned nine years ago. The brothers of the shop then assessed the value of the goods and determined the capital, which was handed over to the current owner to take over the business. A contract was drawn up, instructing the owner to take over the business rights under the eldest brother's name, without responsibility for profit or loss, and to pay an annual rent of up to 10,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the eldest brother harbored ulterior motives and evil intentions, and deliberately created the Yuecaifang Confectionery and Tea Shop in the west of Guanyuan in order to compete. The owner believed that the ancestral legacy should be maintained with all efforts and that everyone should work together to avoid damaging the reputation of the ancestors. Therefore, the owner, despite facing such a great challenge, managed to carry on the family business, which he took as a personal comfort. After the national crisis, a branch of Suzhou Caizhizhai was established at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Yu-tsia-tsing in Shanghai. With the ability to provide genuine goods at fair prices and strive for excellence, the business has been growing rapidly. Last year, the eldest brother suddenly changed his mind again, pointing out that in the current special circumstances, prices have soared, and with his mindset of hoarding and speculating, he wanted to re-evaluate the value of the goods that were assessed nine years ago. He did not hesitate to harm his own relatives, distort the facts, and willingly go to court, filing a lawsuit for execution by the court. He also topped "Yue Zhi Fang" with the "Caizhi Zhai" sign. Since our shop was prohibited from using the "Caizhi Zhai" sign, we have continued to operate without a sign. Thanks to the trust of our customers, the volume of business has remained the same or even increased. However, customers from faraway places may not be aware of the inside story. We are grateful for your attention and continued support. Therefore, we are revealing the circumstances in the newspaper and hope that you will register at the reception desk. Note: "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is located at No. 2 Zhushi Lane, Guanyuan Street. The Shanghai branch of "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is located at No. 7 Rue Yu-tsia-tsing, opposite the Great World. There are no other branches in the country except for this one. The place in Suzhou County that is currently displaying the Caizhi Zhai sign is Yuecaifang in disguise. The real "Suzhou Caizhi Zhai" is temporarily operating without a sign. We hope that all sectors of society will take note.</p>
<h3>European War Ramblings (43): The Inside Story of Germany During the War</h3>
<p>The Germans are not starving. Only the wishful thinkers and those who are poorly informed believe that they are already starving. The fact is that after a year and a half of being blockaded, the National Socialist Party is still able to feed the German people. Americans find it difficult to swallow what Germans eat during wartime, but Germans have been content with large quantities of sweet potatoes, cabbage, and bread for half a century, and they are still eating as much sweet potatoes, cabbage, and bread as possible.</p>
<p>The Germans feel a great lack of meat, fat, butter, and fruit. It is now stipulated that each person can get one pound of meat and a quarter of a pound of butter or margarine per week. This amount is much less than what they usually eat, but it seems to be enough to maintain their health. What is difficult is that fruit, which is richest in vitamins, is often lacking. Last winter was very cold in Germany, and the fruit harvest was very small. When I left Berlin in December, the only fruit sold on the market was apples. Only children, the sick, and pregnant women can enjoy this fruit. There was a time when it was rumored that Germany could get oranges from Italy and Spain, but this did not materialize. During the first winter after the start of the war, I did not see a single orange or banana. At present, vitamin pills of inferior quality are issued to soldiers or children. The food eaten by soldiers is much better than that of civilians. Last Christmas, it was not family members who sent food to the soldiers at the Western Front. Instead, hundreds of thousands of soldiers sent packages of butter, cheese, fruit, and coffee, which they had saved from their rations, to their homes. During the First World War, family members often worried about the healthy men on the front lines. In this war, the soldiers on the front lines are worried about their families.</p>
<p>Since the German army occupied Denmark, a small amount of butter and bacon seems to be available in Berlin, although everyone's rations have not increased. But this supply cannot last, because Danish livestock rely on imported fodder, and the Germans cannot obtain this fodder. Even from the point of view of food, the occupied countries have become a burden to the Germans.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the Germans had no coffee, tea, or chocolate to drink. What they ate was a charred barley that tasted like dishwater. After the Germans concluded secret agreements with commercial firms in Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and South America, a small amount of chocolate was discovered on the market last fall, after escaping the British naval blockade. In addition, the Germans also got a little of this stuff from the estimated area. By Christmas, about every household could buy about a pound of candy. The day before I left Berlin, I witnessed quiet and hopeful Germans patiently lining up in front of a small candy store in the Artlon Hotel, waiting for the distribution of Christmas chocolate candy.</p>
<p>Germans sometimes have to line up in a long line to buy tobacco. Although tobacco is not restricted, tobacco shops have received government orders not to sell more than one pack of cigarettes or two packs of cigars to any customer in a day. Most packs of German cigarettes contain twelve cigarettes, but there are very few that contain the full number, and the quality is also greatly reduced. German-made tobacco with an impure flavor is currently selling a lot. The cigarettes that the Germans smoked during the war were no better than those smoked by the German soldiers I saw in the English Channel last fall. They were smoking "Golden Bar," a British brand that was seized from the French port of Le Havre as war relics.</p>
<p>The supply of fire-starting materials was quite reduced for a time. It was very inconvenient for those who smoked pipe tobacco. Because they could not get good tobacco, they now had to reluctantly smoke the kind of inferior tobacco that would not light. Those who had igniters could not find even a few grams of oil.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been more matches on the market, and a few shops have been secretly supplying fuel oil to customers.</p>
<p>The Germans, feeling nervous during the war, and unable to use all their money to buy food, clothing, or cars, had no choice but to spend their money on what they could buy. As a result, drinking became fashionable for a while. In the days before the German army began invading Poland, Berlin's adults regarded liquor stores as paradise and tried to save grain for use as food or feed. The famous "Pilsner" beer is now completely unrecognizable. In addition, the supply of Germany's famous red wine has also been greatly reduced. Last summer, if you didn't know Luis Artlon, it would be difficult to buy a bottle of red wine in Berlin. Taverns no longer provide peanuts, almonds, olives, or sweet potato chips. Germany has no three kinds of peanuts and other things, so it has also canceled. Only the inexpensive spiral biscuits can still survive.</p>
<p>The exact number of bottles of champagne that the German army got from France is unknown, but it must be at least millions of bottles. Ribbentrop once served as the sales manager of the German Hangel Champagne Company, so he must still be eating and the truck unloading French champagne in front of the residences of other ministers on Detmar Street is endless, so it seems they may no longer be drinking that German-made champagne.</p>
<p>Although the drinking craze in Berlin is strong, prostitution has been greatly affected. Those who used to engage in the life of a goddess have now gone to factories or worked in the fields. Moreover, under the lighting restrictions, everyone cannot see clearly, and the streets are deserted during air raid alarms, so prostitution is quite unfavorable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>工董 Election Unlikely to be Held; British, American, and Japanese Candidates Decided; Intense Competition for Two Additional Board Seats; Taxpaying Chinese Residents Watch Future Developments</h3>
<p>The election of directors to the Shanghai Municipal Council this year has broken the usual silence since Mr. Fessenden’s important speech at the beginning of the month, which broadly proposed changing the number of directors. Various foreign national groups have begun to become active. German and "other nationality" residents are eager to try to put forward candidates and occupy a seat on the council. Therefore, the situation in all parties is very tense. However, according to the explicit provisions of Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the proposal to change the composition of the board to three each for British, American, and Japanese, four for Chinese, one for German, and two for other nationalities must be approved by all treaty nations and the legitimate government of China to be effective. Unexpectedly, yesterday, various foreign national groups nominated candidates for the next board of directors based on the "new ratio". Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>This Year's Election May Be Cancelled</p>
<p>The names of the British, American, Japanese, and German candidates for the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council were learned yesterday. From this, it can be known that this year's election of directors is unlikely to be held, and the consuls general of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will submit a resolution at the special meeting of taxpayers in the Public Concession to increase the number of directors, proposing to appoint sixteen directors, which should be implemented.</p>
<p>British, American, and Japanese Directors All Nominated</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, on the British side, because the British director will give up two seats, only Mr. J. Keswick, Mr. G. W. B. Powell, and Mr. Mitchell will serve as British directors. It was confirmed yesterday (7th) that the American side has nominated Mr. MacDonald (from Whylie &amp; Co.) to fill the additional American director seat. It is said that Mr. MacDonald was nominated at the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce last Friday. The remaining two American directors are Mr. Myers and Mr. Allman. It was also learned from reliable sources this morning that the Japanese directors will be Mr. Otoichi Okamoto, Mr. Ikusaku Okamoto, and Mr. Yuta Hata, the latter two being current Japanese directors. Mr. Otoichi Okamoto has also served as a Japanese director before.</p>
<p>Intense Competition for Two Additional Seats</p>
<p>It is also reported that the German director seat will be filled by Mr. Kraetzer, a German resident of this city. The two director seats for other nationalities are expected to be filled by one person each from Portugal and Switzerland, but their names have not yet been revealed. It is reported that the competition for the two director seats for other nationalities is fierce. Mr. Wettler of Switzerland, the protagonist of the large copper theft case, was the first to respond, saying he will participate in the election. Subsequently, the Portuguese Consul General, Mr. Mello, stated that he would make every effort to win a seat on the Shanghai Municipal Council for the 6,000 Portuguese residents of Shanghai. The most vocal candidates for Portuguese director are Dr. Tavares, Mr. Loureiro, and Mr. Sousa, who works at Jardine Matheson. Later, the Russian Residents Association also convened a meeting by Chairman Ivanov to participate in this year's election of directors. However, observing the situation, the Portuguese and Swiss residents have a greater chance of success, but Wettler relies on the Japanese, and public opinion strongly opposes him. The Swiss Consul also declared that Wettler's arrest warrant has not been revoked. Mr. Ivanov of the Russian side is the chairman of the White Russian Association after the assassination of former Chairman Meraz.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng's Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>On the Chinese director side, after the free taxpaying Chinese residents nominated the current directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Tingrui, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun through communication methods to continue their positions, there has been no further development. Later, Yu, Chen, and Guo left Shanghai one after another. The only remaining ones are Yuan Ludeng and Xi Yushu. According to Mr. Yuan speaking to the reporters of the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, the Taxpaying Chinese Residents Association has not taken any action on the special situation of the next election of directors. It is also impossible to convene a meeting to elect directors to fill the vacancies because only half of the taxpaying Chinese residents are staying in Shanghai. According to the plan set by the three consuls general, the number of Chinese directors is reduced from five to four seats. Currently, there are only two people staying in Shanghai, so there are still two vacancies. All parties are paying close attention to the issue of candidates for these two remaining seats. Because under this difficult situation, the status of the Chinese directors is completely different from that of directors from other countries, so future developments are highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>From a Legal Perspective, There Are Many Criticisms</p>
<p>According to Article 9 of the Land Regulations, the election of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council should be held one week before the annual taxpayers' meeting, and the current directors will serve until the annual taxpayers' meeting when the new directors officially take office. According to this year's special situation, the change in the number of directors must first be approved by the special taxpayers' meeting, and even if it is approved by the various treaty nations, it must finally obtain the consent of the legitimate government of China to be effective and implementable. Therefore, this year's election should logically be held after the special taxpayers' meeting. However, various resident groups have elected candidate directors according to the new ratio without the recommendation being approved by the various treaty nations and the Chinese government. From a legal point of view, this is very inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Strict Martial Law Once Enforced in the Western District of the Concession Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, various roads in the western Shanghai area adjacent to the Public Concession and the French Concession enforced a period of martial law. Police authorities from both concessions dispatched police officers to temporarily block the entrances and exits of various roads leading from Jing'an Temple along Haig Road to western Shanghai using barbed wire. Only trams and buses were allowed to pass, while pedestrians were prevented from entering and exiting. The "Special Police" of western Shanghai also implemented similar precautions. Traffic was restored after about an hour, but the inspection of pedestrians entering and exiting remained strict. It is understood that this temporary precaution was due to Fu Xiaoan's burial yesterday, fearing that unexpected events might occur.</p>
<h3>German Embassy Screens European War Films</h3>
<p>Mr. Koert, the information specialist from the German Embassy in China, hosted a screening of recently arrived newsreels about the European war for the Chinese and foreign press at the German School on Great Western Road at 4:30 PM yesterday. More than forty people from the Chinese and foreign press attended. After a speech by Mr. Koert, the films were screened. The content included scenes of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria signing the Axis alliance in Vienna, etc. The event ended at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Regain Freedom Today</h3>
<p>According to news obtained by this newspaper this morning, more than a hundred employees of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications who were detained last month have now reached a resolution through multi-party negotiations by financial figures in Shanghai and abroad. It is said that they will be completely free today.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for Renting Ships to Transport Rice Have Begun to Bear Fruit</h3>
<p>Coal Briquette Factory Dramatically Raises Price by Seventy Yuan</p>
<p>Since the authorities actively sought to dredge the source of foreign rice, a ship chartering committee has been established to handle ship chartering affairs. The ships chartered will sail between Shanghai and Yangon, so that 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice can be transported from Yangon to Shanghai every month. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that after the two authorities conducted ship chartering separately, considerable progress has been made. It is said that the rice-transporting ships and transportation costs have been negotiated one after another, and they will soon be available for legitimate rice merchants to load foreign rice. However, the rice transported by the ships must be registered with the authorities when they arrive, otherwise, they will not be able to enjoy the right.</p>
<p>Extra-Trade Rice Orders Should Be Rejected</p>
<p>Rice firms in the city usually place orders for foreign rice through trading firms such as Dafoo and Hoffine. But some speculators outside the trade have also made large orders for foreign rice, storing it in Shanghai in the hopes of profiting when the rice market experiences disturbances. They raise prices, fabricate rumors, and cause chaos. The entire city hopes that foreign firms will reject large orders from people outside the trade.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Have Reached a Critical Juncture</p>
<p>The city's entire fuel problem has reached a most critical juncture. The soaring prices and the chaos have broken records. However, the source of supply has not decreased, and the transportation costs are only about six US dollars per ton. Therefore, large coal chunks and coal powder have been transported to Shanghai, and the stock in coal warehouses has increased. Although the transportation costs have risen slightly, the coal has not yet arrived. The market trading is all for coal transported in one or two months ago.</p>
<p>Price Hiking is Alarming</p>
<p>The highest selling price of flue-cured white coal has broken the 400-yuan mark, and there is a situation where there is money but no goods. Major dealers insist on hoarding goods and refuse to circulate them on the market. It is also heard that some coal dealers are still sucking up coal in the market. Most small coal briquette factories cannot buy coal powder. The prices of firewood and charcoal available for sale vary greatly. A certain large coal briquette factory, in addition to hoarding coal powder, privately invited fellow traders to set the price, which was raised by as much as seventy yuan per per load yesterday. The current price is 296 yuan, plus three yuan for delivery, and 16 yuan per dan (100 catties) at the retail store.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Inspects Luggage and Goods on Ships Traveling Between Shanghai and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Passengers Not Allowed to Leave the Ship After Boarding</p>
<p>Since April 1, the Hong Kong government has strictly enforced the regulations on the inspection of goods and passenger luggage. The scope of the inspection is limited to ocean liners traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Inland river ships are not within the scope of the inspection. After the regulations are implemented, all goods exported from Hong Kong and luggage carried by passengers traveling from Hong Kong to other places must be inspected and approved by designated inspection officers and issued a release certificate before they can be transported to the ship, otherwise, they will not be allowed.</p>
<p>Goods</p>
<p>Goods exported from Hong Kong must go through the designated procedures before they can be shipped on the ship. However, they must be inspected at the wharf in advance, and the weighing bureau must be notified 24 hours in advance so that officials can be sent to the scene to inspect. The goods must be weighed on shore, and the inspector may order the owner to unpack the cargo for inspection. After the inspection, a mark will be written on the outside of the cargo, and an inspection certificate will be issued. The owner must submit the inspection certificate, together with the shipping manifest and customs declaration, to the Import and Export Department, and the person in charge will issue a release certificate before the goods can be shipped on the ship. For goods shipped by ship in Hong Kong, they must be stored in the Kowloon Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, Yik Yick Warehouse, and Jardine Warehouse designated in Hong Kong. Agents carrying goods transshipped in Hong Kong must submit a list of the goods they are carrying, together with the original documents of each item, to the Import and Export Department for stamping. Goods stored in the Kowloon Warehouse and Taikoo Warehouse can be inspected by British tax officials stationed in each warehouse. For goods stored in Yik Yick Warehouse and Jardine Warehouse, officials must be sent by the Import and Export Department for inspection. After all the goods have been inspected and a permit obtained, the warehouse must be responsible for sending the goods to the ship.</p>
<p>Luggage</p>
<p>Passengers leaving Hong Kong on ships from Kowloon Warehouse or Taikoo Warehouse must send their large luggage to the luggage inspection office of each warehouse in advance for inspection. If the passenger entrusts a travel agency to transport the luggage, they must hand over the keys of the suitcase to the person transporting the luggage so that they can be opened when the inspector orders it. If there is no key, the inspector may open the suitcase by any means to carry out the inspection work. If passengers rely on ships in Hong Kong wharves or anchored at sea, their large luggage must be sent to the Queen's Pier in Central at the specified time, and an inspector will be responsible for inspecting the luggage at the pier. As for small carry-on luggage, passengers can carry it on board and be inspected on the ship. Ships carrying export immigrants must be anchored in the export immigrant anchorage area. Passengers are allowed to board the ship within the time specified in advance by the Import and Export Department and the Shipping Administration Department. Other people, except hotel staff who have a pass from the shipping company and wear armbands, are not allowed to board the ship. If the ship is allowed not to sail to the export immigrant anchorage area, passengers are allowed to board the ship only after the loading of goods is completed. Passengers are not allowed to leave the ship after boarding. Before departure, each ship must report its scheduled departure time.</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes in Various Industries</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the high cost of living and the insistence on rice prices, workers in various industries have made demands on employers to improve treatment. Many have been resolved, while others are still under mediation. Workers in several industries have also made demands. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Disputes over Allocation for Garment Workers</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the planned strike by garment workers resulted in an increase in garment prices by more than 50%. For example, the original prices for cheongsams were four yuan for single-layer, five yuan for interlining, and six yuan for cotton. The prices for men's long gowns were the same. Now the prices for cheongsams have increased to six yuan for single-layer, seven yuan for interlining, and eight yuan for cotton. The prices for men's long gowns are seven yuan for single-layer, eight yuan for interlining, and nine yuan for cotton. After the increase in garment wages, the labor unrest could have been eliminated. However, due to the problem of profit distribution between labor and management, the garment shops usually deduct 10% of each garment worker's income, and the shop owner and the shop foreman split the amount equally. This rule is maintained as before. The shop foreman should pay the shop owner 50 cents for each day's meal money. Now the shop owner has proposed increasing it to one yuan per day due to soaring rice prices. The shop foreman has only agreed to increase by 50% of the amount of the wage increase, which is 75 cents. The shop owner has not agreed, so labor and management have disagreements. Yesterday, most of the garment workers participated in the strike, and the unrest has a tendency to expand. As for the workers who participated in destroying the garment shops in Maiyu Lane in the French Concession the day before yesterday, 13 people have been arrested and detained in the police station, awaiting investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law for the crimes of disturbing order and damage.</p>
<p>Moving Companies Labor and Management Disagree; Ningbo, Youning, Yongan, Shangtian and other four moving companies, a total of drivers, to capital requested an increase in cost of living subsidies of 100 percent on the fifth day ago in the morning of each company, a total of hundreds of dozens of drivers were on strike at a rate According to Datong News Agency reporters in the afternoon two leasing authorities sent representatives to each of the companies for mediation in the matter, after all, because of wide differences in views, it could not be set up that the strike is feared to be difficult to resolve for a time, heard yesterday that the company's handyman workers also have a strike in addition to the French Concession Ma Lang Road China Car Row days ago, the driver, Liu Ming You, was suspended and that has caused labor disputes</p>
<h3>News of the Sale of the American Club Again; Price Offered of Over 2.2 Million Legal Tender; Rumored to Be Purchased by Shanghai Securities Company</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Shanghai Securities Company offered 2,225,000 yuan in legal tender to purchase the American Club. The Club held a special meeting on February 28 to nominate a special committee to discuss the matter. It has recently been learned from reliable sources that the committee has recommended to all members of the Club to accept the transaction, stating that although Club fees have increased, maintenance costs have also risen, and it will be difficult for the Club to balance income and expenditure next year.</p>
<p>Lower Floors Still Leased for Club Use</p>
<p>It is said that when Shanghai Securities Company proposed to purchase the American Club, it agreed to lease the lower three floors of the building to the American Club for a period of two years, with an option to extend for another two years. Shanghai Securities Company also agreed that the front door of the building would be used exclusively by the Club, while the upper floors would be converted into office space, and a separate entrance would be opened in the alley. According to members of the American Club, they are quite confused about the buyer, Shanghai Securities Company, because the name of the company is not found in the business directory. It is also heard that several other parties also wanted to purchase the Club, but after consideration by the special committee, they have all been rejected because Shanghai Securities Company offered the highest price.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Sale</p>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, members of the American Club will meet at 5:30 PM on the 10th of this month to consider the recommendation of the Club's special committee to sell the Club to Shanghai Securities Company. It is said that the company has agreed to lease the lower floors of the building to the American Club after purchasing the Club, with a monthly rent of 3% of the selling price of 2,225,000 yuan, which is 5,625 yuan. The American Club will bear three-sevenths of the water and electricity costs, and the remainder will be paid by the buyer. The furniture and equipment in the Club will still belong to the Club. If the American Club accepts the sale, after paying off its debts, there will be a surplus of one million yuan. The special committee proposes to convert this surplus into US dollars and keep it as a reserve fund for use in emergencies.</p>
<h3>Belgian Consulate to Respond to the Arrest of Aiko; Protest May Be Lodged for Unauthorized Entry into the Belgian Emigrant Office; Lawyer Plumer Has Requested a Meeting</h3>
<p>Aiko, the leader of the Free Persons Movement in Shanghai, has been arrested for allegedly conspiring with French Navy personnel to escape. He is currently being detained on the French gunboat *Chanier*. It is said that his lawyer, Plumer, formally applied to the French Navy authorities yesterday (7th) for permission to meet with Aiko.</p>
<p>Belgian Authorities to Respond</p>
<p>Belgian authorities may protest to the French Consulate within a day or two, objecting to the French soldiers' unauthorized entry into the Belgian Emigrant Office, a Belgian-owned property, to arrest Aiko without a warrant. The Belgian Consulate remained silent yesterday morning regarding the type of protest to be lodged, only stating that the Belgian authorities in Shanghai are currently investigating the matter and will take "appropriate steps" after the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>Defense Attorney Unable to Meet</p>
<p>Lawyer Plumer stated yesterday morning that he hoped to see Aiko to defend him. A French Navy officer told him that he would not be allowed to meet with Aiko until the investigation currently being conducted by the French Navy authorities is completed. The investigation may take another week to complete. After the middle of the month, Aiko will be interrogated.</p>
<p>French Residents in the City Very Dissatisfied</p>
<p>According to news this morning, the French residents in the city are superficially calm about the French Navy authorities' arrest of Aiko, but they are actually quite indignant in their hearts. If the French authorities had considered Aiko's usual behavior, they should have taken less severe measures, which would not have caused resentment.</p>
<p>200 Soldiers Stationed on the Chanier</p>
<p>The American Columbia Broadcasting Company is willing to provide radio broadcasting equipment so that the Shanghai Tagore group can broadcast a five-minute message to the people of China today or tomorrow. It is said that there are 200 Annamite soldiers stationed on the French gunboat *Chanier*, where Aiko is being detained, to prevent the ship's sailors from rebelling. The Free Persons Movement here has taken precautions to prevent the French authorities from continuing to arrest other prominent free persons. It is said that the special police of the French Concession have gone on strike in protest of the French authorities' arrest of Aiko.</p>
<h3>Continued Donations to the New Puyu Hall</h3>
<p>The New Puyu Hall continued to receive enthusiastic donations from all walks of life yesterday. A summary of the jointly signed names is as follows: Mr. Zhang Jinling donated 300 yuan transferred from the celebration of his great birthday, and another 122 yuan transferred from the surplus funds, 100 yuan from Chunshengtang, 100 yuan from Mr. Jin Dali, 30 yuan from Fangji, 10 yuan from Mr. Zhu Ruiting, and 7 yuan from Qiji.

<h3>A Visit to Free China: The Life of Hemingway; An Introduction to the Contemporary American War Writer</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhen</p>
<p>Hemingway, a contemporary American war writer, is currently observing in the front and rear of our country, collecting material for his new book. His life and style are introduced below:</p>
<p>Hemingway is an eccentric in modern American literature. All of his works are based on reality and have the touching power of the great English poet Byron. His works are like a flame, often emitting a strange and passionate magic. His style is very rough, often making people suspect that he is a barbarian, but in reality, he is a good man.</p>
<p>He was born in Oak Park, Illinois in 1898. His father was a doctor and had six children, of whom he was the second. From an early age, he followed his father to learn shooting and fishing, and hunted in northern Michigan. At the age of fifteen, he once left his family, but soon returned home and continued to study at the local high school. After graduating, he served as a low-level reporter for the Kansas City Star. In a few months, the United States entered World War I, and he was sent to the Italian front, first as a nurse, then assigned to the infantry, and later wounded in action. After World War I ended, the Greco-Turkish War broke out, and he served as a war correspondent for an American newspaper, entering and leaving the line of fire, and experienced many risks. Later, when he went to Paris as a correspondent for the *Toronto Star*, he was only twenty-two years old, but he was already world-weary.</p>
<p>At this time, he began writing in Paris. His debut work, *Up in Michigan*, was published in 1921. His style is simple and unadorned, without any affectation. He likes to use ordinary words to express sincere emotions. Readers see the works of other writers as if they are taking a horse-drawn carriage to see flowers, appreciating them casually, but when they read his works, they cannot help but feel shock and terror, and their emotions are boiling.</p>
<p>Hemingway's first successful work was the short story collection *In Our Time*, published in 1925, depicting stories of war and bullfighting. Two years later, *The Sun Also Rises* was published, depicting the story of a group of outcasts. By 1929, the love novel *A Farewell to Arms*, based on World War I, was published, and he became famous in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>After that, he published *Death in the Afternoon*, *Green Hills of Africa*, *To Have and Have Not*, and other works. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1937, Hemingway went to Madrid as a war correspondent, which was a major turning point in his thinking. He then completed *The Fifth Column*, *The Spanish Earth*, and the novel *For Whom the Bell Tolls*. (To be continued) Hemingway and his wife</p>

<h3>Extortion of Cheng Yuxin Tea Shop: Fierce Bandit Refuses Arrest and Struggles, Specifically Sends Letter Demanding Extortion of 20,000 US Dollars, One Bandit Shot and Captured at Designated Meeting Place</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, a case of police and bandits fighting occurred on Route Zikawei, Shanghai West. On the spot, one bandit was shot in the back and captured. The case is complex and intricate. Here are the details gathered by our newspaper reporters:</p>
<p>Details of a Threatening Letter and a Bullet</p>
<p>Cheng Yuxin Tea Shop in this city is a large enterprise, with four branches. The day before yesterday at 4 PM, a man in a Western suit delivered a letter to the Cheng Yuxin No. 1 branch at No. 7 Guixing Lane, Guangdong Road, Public Concession. He handed the letter to the counter. The shop assistant, seeing the shop's name on the envelope, immediately opened it and was shocked to find a threatening letter addressed to the owner, Cheng Shisheng, and the manager, Cheng Zuoquan. Enclosed in the letter were two pistol bullets, with the names "Shisheng" and "Zuoquan" engraved on them. It demanded a huge sum of 20,000 US dollars. The letter also stated that a representative wearing a blue cloth long gown, holding two tins of "Three Castles" cigarettes and a newspaper as a sign, must be sent to the entrance of Yuyuan Lane on Route Zikawei at 4 PM on the 7th for negotiation. After reading the letter, the shop assistants were terrified. The man then opened his Western suit outside the counter, revealing a hand grenade hanging in front of his chest, and said that if they did not come tomorrow, he would treat them with this, and then left, his whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>A Great Fight Ensues: Bandit Shot and Captured</p>
<p>The shop assistants presented the letter to Cheng Shisheng and Cheng Zuoquan. Cheng and others, seeing the fierceness of the bandits, reported the information to the Zhabei Police Station. The Zhabei Police Station sent detective Guo Ruiquan to handle the case. Guo went to Shanghai West to meet with "Special Police Unit" "Detective Team Leader" Chen Zhongfang, "Deputy Team Leader" Liu Jinsheng, Yin Zhanqing, and others. Around 4 PM yesterday, they disguised themselves and waited near the entrance of Yuyuan Lane for the bandits. The disguised negotiator acted according to the plan, loitering there for a while. A car sped over, and a bandit inside, seeing the disguised negotiator, jumped out of the car, grabbed the negotiator's hand, and threatened him with a pistol, attempting to force him into the car. At this time, the detectives saw the situation and rushed forward to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the bandit had also seen through them and fired his gun first. The detectives returned fire, and gunshots rang out, causing pedestrians to scatter. In the end, both sides fired dozens of shots. The bandit fled to the intersection of Jiasfei Road and Jinjia Lane before being shot in the back and falling to the ground, captured.</p>
<p>Bandit Rented Car: Confesses Name as Ding Xuewen</p>
<p>Earlier, at 3:42 PM yesterday, a bandit went to the Tailai Automobile Company branch on Yuyuan Road, saying that he needed to rent a car to transport a guest. The branch sent driver Wang Changgen to drive car number 12119. After the passenger got into the car, he instructed Wang to drive to the entrance of Yuyuan Lane. When the car reached the Zikawei Road 404 Western Children's School, the man saw the disguised negotiator wandering back and forth, so he asked Wang to stop temporarily. Wang stopped the car. When the passenger opened fire on the detectives, Wang realized he was a robber. At that time, stray bullets were flying, but fortunately, no passersby were injured. Traffic in the surrounding area was temporarily suspended. It was later learned that the bandit who was shot and captured had been taken away by the Zhabei Police Station and confessed his name as Ding Xuewen, 31 years old. The case is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Arms Case: Continued Investigation</h3>
<p>Police Remain Extremely Silent: Surprising Developments Expected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that police sources claimed yesterday (6th) that after Zhabei Police Station detectives confiscated a large number of weapons last Friday and arrested 18 Chinese, no one else had been arrested, nor had any more weapons been confiscated. Therefore, there has been no further development in the matter. Those who have been arrested have not admitted to participating in:</p>
<p>Armed Crime</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether the Public Concession Police Department's firearms experts have found any clues in the confiscated weapons to prove that the arrested persons participated in any armed crimes.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, however, there will soon be a "surprising" discovery. The police are extremely silent about this arrest and are unwilling to disclose any information. It is generally expected that those arrested will confess to participating in kidnappings, robberies, and assassinations for political reasons.</p>

<p>My father, Zhao Qingkui, is currently working as a detective in the police station. After I was arrested for stealing a gun, my father stopped providing for my family. Later, after your court sentenced me to imprisonment with probation, my father did not help me find a job. I had no choice but to live off my savings. The day before yesterday, when we had no money at home, I asked my wife to beg my father, but she was scolded and sent back. I was</p>
<p>Forced to Act Out of Desperation</p>
<p>I thought, taking advantage of the landlord's sound sleep at night, I used a hemp rope to tie it to the iron railing on the drying platform, then pulled the rope down with both hands, broke into the landlord's bedroom, and stole several pieces of clothing. This was also due to economic pressure. I ask the court to be lenient. The court reviewed the situation and ordered him to be returned to custody, with the hearing postponed to the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3>Outbreak of Balkan War: Gold Price Drops Significantly; Already Enters 500 Yuan Level</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for gold saw a sudden sharp drop in price, falling below the 6,500 yuan level. Everyone was nervous. Shanghai West speculators had over 2,000 taels in short positions, but amidst the negative rumors, the price continued to fall lower. Reports claimed Germany had declared war on Greece, and there were rumors of a loan agreement between China and the US. In the afternoon, there were even rumors of a Southern Chinese defeat, and a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan. Nervous individuals saw this as a sign of an aggressive Japanese advance into Southern China. Although three gold shops vigorously bought in the morning, slightly raising the price to 6,515 yuan, it soon fell below 6,500 yuan. In the last half hour of the afternoon, the rumors intensified. Gold shops, silver shops, and securities firms all sold, causing the price to plummet to a closing price of 6,455 yuan, down 82 yuan. The total trading volume was 25,600 taels. Cash transactions were rare, and most cash shops were watching from the sidelines. Fei Wenyuan sold 20 taels to Fang Jiuxia at a price 170 yuan higher than the futures price, and another 10 taels to Chida at a price 180 yuan higher. In the afternoon, there were sellers at 170 yuan higher, but no transactions were seen. The price was over 90 yuan lower than last Saturday. Jewelry gold dropped by 10 yuan to 680 yuan.

<p>Black Market Drops 82 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the price of foreign exchange fell in the morning and international tensions worsened, the market was soft. The opening price at 9:15 was 27 yuan lower, at 6,510 yuan. The public panicked, and Chengyi and Xianghe vigorously bought, so it retreated to 6,500 yuan, then rose to 6,505 yuan. Dafengyi, Dade Fu, Gonghe, and Hengji came to sell, as did Chengyi. Furthermore, US dollars for this month were available at 5.34375 yuan, making the market very weak. The price then dropped 42 yuan to 6,470 yuan. Tongkang, Yongxin, Fengyong, and Dechengmi absorbed the supply, stopping the decline and rebounding. Dafeng and Xinyuan also bought, and there were rumors that Shanghai West speculators were buying. Foreign exchange also stopped falling, and the price rose by more than 40 yuan, reaching 6,513 yuan. Tianyuan, Gonghe, and Deda came to sell again, causing the price to fall again at noon. The closing price at noon was 6,490 yuan. The market opened at 6,490 yuan at 2:00 PM and then stabilized for a long time. Silver shops sold, causing the price to retreat from 6,493 yuan to 6,483 yuan. Dafeng and Chengyi bought, raising it to 6,498 yuan.

<h3>Dried Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Rises Another 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan continues to rise as the supply is limited and domestic sales are strong. It opened at a higher price of 10 yuan, but was still not willing to sell in large quantities. The market is expected to continue tightening.</p>
<h3>Grains: Stockpilers Emerge Mid-Course: Rice Prices Rebound and Then Stabilize</h3>
<p>The rice market, which was closed for the Qingming Festival and the weekly holiday for two days, resumed normal operations yesterday. At the opening of the early market, the foreign rice market was strong, as local shops eagerly sought to replenish their supplies, and demand felt strong. Those who had been floating the market, seeing the active sales, successively came out to absorb supplies. The situation was unusually vigorous at the time. Vendors took the opportunity to raise prices, and all prices rose, rising about one yuan each. No. 1 Saigon opened at 110 yuan, No. 2 at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, 107 yuan, Gao Baishen Xiaojiao at 107 yuan and 5 jiao, 107 yuan, Zhongguan at 106 yuan, and Suijian at 87 yuan. However, after this brief flurry, the hearts of the people could not help but ease, as large shipments continued to arrive at the port. Actual sales immediately turned sluggish again, and at the same time, those who had been floating the market also came out to sell one after another. Brokers even dumped large quantities of spot goods, creating a situation where there was more supply than demand. The rising trend was immediately frustrated, and all prices gradually fell back to the original levels at the close of the market. Statistics show that after the rise and fall, it reached a stable level compared to the week before, without much change. No. 1 Saigon remained at 109 yuan, No. 2 at 1067 yuan, No. 1 Siam at 1089 yuan, Huojiao Gao from 108 yuan, Jue at 106 yuan, Baishen Xiaojiao at 106 yuan and 5 jiao, 106 yuan, Zhongguan at 105 yuan and 5 jiao, 105 yuan, Tokyo Suijian at 978 yuan, Cuijian from 867 yuan, Jue to 812 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice, Dahe also arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, loaded with 8,353 bags of foreign rice and 927 sentences of corn from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 5th of the previous day and docked at the company's pier in Pudong to unload. The Shun'an wheel arrived at the port on the same day, also loaded with 7,622 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (6th), loaded with 15,983 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier in the French Concession to unload.</p>
<p>The arrival of Guo rice, such as thick and thin Japonica, is still not strong, and in terms of sales, general shops are still not willing to buy because the door-to-door sales are not extensive. Therefore, although those who want to raise prices, it is difficult to get their wish, and the result can only be that there is no change. Changbang Hujian Tebai Geng is 1078 yuan, Gao 116 yuan, Qingte Geng 110 yuan, Kunshan Hujian Bai Geng 1145 yuan, Dashibai 1112 yuan, and the next to 109 yuan. Qing Hao Hujian Bo Dao is 109 yuan and 108 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The way for glutinous rice is also not extensive. Except for the fact that cake shops and rice shops sell a little, wholesale transactions have all stopped. However, the market is not abundant, and the market is worthy of standing firm, without rising or falling. Hong Kong Te Yuan still opens at 1045 yuan, Jue to 100 yuan, Nuocha Gao from 967 yuan, the next to 93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Active Sales: Flour Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Burmese Flour: The flour market yesterday, at the opening in the morning, the buying was intense, because after the holiday, actual sales gradually moved, and it was heard that the North and South customers had been buying at low prices, and the Taishang residents were also gradually active. Zhonglou Huaniao brand noodles opened at 28 yuan and 23 jiao, and Jinlong brand noodles opened at 28 yuan. Then, because customers and residents bought, the price secretly tightened. Before the evening market, those who held the goods were even more guarded, and the market prospects may have the hope of development, because after being tired for many days, the price has been low, which has attracted the attention of speculators inside and outside the industry.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market situation was still plain and unremarkable, because although the arrival of goods was rare these days, each flour factory's purchasing was very sluggish. Gao Du wheat was 456 yuan, lacking a considerable recipient, but those who held the goods insisted on not selling at a low price, so the situation was still brewing.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Speculation Resumes: Results in a Sharp Increase of Five or Six Yuan</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market had been brewing for a long time under the competition between bulls and bears. Yesterday, there was a sudden wave, rumors spread, speculative desires were strong, bulls were strong, and prices rose. At the highest peak, it soared by six or seven yuan compared to before the holiday. Although there was a suppression by bears in the middle, but it was a drop in the bucket, and it did not help. The result was still a sharp increase of five or six yuan. It is estimated that 20 pieces of Yantai oil were traded, the price was 100 yuan, 300 dan of Dayou Factory oil, the price was 103 yuan and 5 jiao to 07 yuan, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, the price was 143 yuan and 5 jiao to 147 yuan, and then 146 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. 300 barrels were ordered to be delivered in April, the price was 143 yuan to 146 yuan and 7 jiao Niu, and over 1,000 barrels were ordered to be delivered in April, the price was 144 yuan and 5 jiao to 49 yuan and 5 jiao, and then 48 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,260 bags of soybeans came from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Today (8th), 530 bags of soybeans are transported to Xiamen, and another 840 bags are transported to Zhoushan, and another 250 bags are transported to Luzon. In addition, 375 bags of sesame seeds are transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Actual Sales Not Very Developed; "Double Horse" Yarn is Carried Up by Miscellaneous Brands</h3>
<p>The yarn market shows a slight upward trend, as confidence has turned firmer. At the same time, miscellaneous yarn brands are in tight supply. 20-count "Angel," "Double Globe," "Special Gold City" yarns are all trending upward, with the price gap between them and "Double Horse" yarn narrowing daily. Therefore, market sentiment has hardened somewhat. However, actual transactions have not been very active. Coupled with the tense situation in the Balkans, short sellers still exert heavy pressure. Nevertheless, many parties are discussing that while white goods are rising, cotton yarn is declining. They have not given up on absorbing chips. Securities firms have returned to buy, mostly scooping up available supply. Certain short sellers have also covered significantly. Under these circumstances, there might be some recovery. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn is 1,400 yuan, and the low price is 1,391 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,399 yuan to 1,400 yuan, then fell to 1,394 yuan following the gold price decline. The final price was 1,395-6 yuan. Today, five bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 100 bales to Hong Kong, 620 bales to Siam, and 150 bales to Little Luzon.</p>
<p>The "Double Horse" yarn market opened flat this morning. The initial price was 1,392 yuan, slightly declining to 91 yuan. At this time, buyers were eager, and securities firms dragged in a large quantity, causing the price to rise to 1,400 yuan in an instant. Although market sentiment was tense, it failed to break through 400 yuan. However, as the margin call price fell, sellers became slightly active, and the price dropped to 1,392.5 yuan. Nevertheless, the chips on the trading floor were not very abundant. Some say that the tense situation in the Balkans, while not lowering market prices, offers potential upside. At the same time, miscellaneous yarn prices rose, and buyers rushed back, causing the price to gradually rise to 1,398 yuan at closing. A check of the intraday transaction statistics shows 5,280 bales traded. The amounts bought by various firms are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 150; Mainland: 25</p>
<p>Xiamen: 5; Peers: 5,100</p>
<p>Total: 5,280</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills' Appetite Gradually Opens; Peer Trading Also Still Lively</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains good. Prices for 42-count and 32-count raw materials are rising daily. This is because fine yarn prices are exceptionally high, and mills are making substantial profits. Therefore, they are eagerly acquiring these raw materials, and market sentiment is uniformly bullish. As for 10-count raw materials, they are also being carried up, although the increase is relatively moderate. However, inter-dealer trading is extremely active. The willingness of Chinese mills to operate is gradually improving. Yesterday, manufacturers and peers traded a total of 2,035 bales, with prices increasing by 1-2 yuan. The current cotton market prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Remain Weak as Before</h3>
<p>Public bonds: The unofficial market situation remained unable to rally yesterday. Although many parties have a strong appetite to buy, they prefer to obtain cheap prices. Therefore, when sellers are eager, they take advantage of low prices to buy, without raising prices. The market price of Class A bonds is the lowest because the redemption period has expired, and they are being sold to repay debts. There is no other factor. Currently, the price difference between Class A and Class C bonds is only 8 yuan and 5 jiao, making it the cheapest of the five types of bonds. Such a good price may not be easily obtained in the future because Yuxing is selling off inventory to realize cash as the redemption period expires. Even the bullish positions in Class A bonds of Renfeng and Fengfeng cannot be maintained. Trading volume was not high yesterday. Xinfu continued to buy in the morning, and the amount was not small. Juxin, Yitai, Xinfeng, and Yichang also bought. Market prices initially rose and then fell. Class A bonds opened at 8 jiao and fell to 3 jiao, causing other types of bonds to also decline slightly. In the afternoon, only Class C bonds were relatively stable. Xinfu continued to buy, and Shunchang also had strong buying interest. Renchang and Delong also had substantial appetite. However, Yuxing, Renfeng, and Hefeng sold, especially Class A bonds. As a result, Class C bonds did not fluctuate, while Class A bonds fell by as much as 6 jiao. Other Class B, D, and E bonds also declined by 2-3 jiao accordingly. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.67 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of China Bank stock were traded at a price of 13 yuan, equivalent to 65% of face value.</p>
<h3>Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory Issues Dividends</h3>
<p>Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, one of the three major pharmaceutical factories in this city, recently resolved at a joint meeting of directors to issue a dividend of 1 fen for the 29th year, starting from April 16th, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coal: Alarming; Coal Balls Rise by 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>The coal ball market rose sharply again yesterday due to the surge in maritime shipping costs. Prices from peer manufacturers and factories suddenly increased by 70 yuan, from 200 sixteen yuan per ton for train cars. Retail prices at local street stores were 16 yuan per load. Prices have increased by two installments in ten days, reaching 110 yuan, which is truly alarming. Although there are elaborate explanations, it is difficult to dismiss suspicions of manipulation.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Large Purchases from Guangdong and Hong Kong; Cotton Cloth Experiences Another Round of Price Increases</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market situation was vigorous yesterday due to large purchases from Guangdong and Hong Kong, which stimulated market sentiment. Peers and hoarders seized the opportunity to hoard, causing the quiet cloth market to experience another round of price increases. Sales prices for various cloths opened slightly higher in the morning and then continued to rise step by step. As a result, white goods and coarse cloth increased by 5 jiao per piece, while fine cloth and twill increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. Colored cloth, serge, and woolen fabrics increased by about 1 yuan. Bleached cloth and light-colored fabrics experienced a smaller increase due to seasonal limitations in customer sales. The current market for finished products is stronger than that for gray cloth. Yihua Factory issued over 1,000 bales of coarse cloth for April-May delivery. Chinese factories issued a few hundred bales of fine cloth and twill for April delivery, mostly absorbed by peers and dyeing factories. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased over 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang and Fujian buyers purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Local street transactions for various cloths were nearly 10 pieces.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Promotes Mobile Schools; Number of Schools Increased from 60 to 100; Rising Prices Cause Increases in Recurring Expenses</h3>
<p>Lishui Correspondence: Zhejiang Province has established mobile schools and implemented mobile teaching to adapt to extraordinary times. At the same time, it examines the following situations: (1) scattered villages, inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to concentrate children; (2) impoverished areas, sparse population, unable to establish complete schools; (3) many children out of school due to the impact of war, with no schools to enter; (4) children unable to attend school full-day or half-day due to transportation and living conditions. Based on the above four situations, 40 schools were initially established in 16 counties close to the war zone in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and counties with inconvenient transportation in Wuyi, Lishui, and Jinyun in April of the 27th year. They adopted a one-year or two-year short-term primary school teaching method, divided into: (1) long-term gathering, setting up a class in each suitable location, with an enrollment of about 15 people, with teachers teaching full-day or rotating in the morning and afternoon; (2) temporary gathering, with no enrollment limit, with teachers temporarily gathering and teaching, ending after a certain period of time and continuing or changing locations to teach. After this trial, there were many successes. In September of the same year, 20 provincial-run mobile schools were established in 10 counties close to western Zhejiang and the war zone, such as Xindeng, Lin'an, Yuqian, Fenshui, and Tonglu, so that local children out of school could all be admitted free of charge and school supplies were provided. The number of mobile schools also increased from 60 to 100. As many as possible, those who were familiar with the situation in the war zone in various counties in western Zhejiang were selected to serve as principals and teachers of mobile schools. Before selection, they underwent rigorous examinations and training, which was a further step compared to the first and second decisions to examine or select unemployed teachers in the war zone. Regarding the funding for mobile schools, it was 2,800 yuan in the 26th year, 6,540 yuan in the 27th year, and 48,480 yuan in the 28th year. When each school was established in April of the 27th year, each school was given an establishment fee of 10 yuan, a preparation fee of 10 yuan, a monthly salary of 14 yuan for the principal and teacher, an office expense of 6 yuan, and a travel expense of 2 yuan, with a monthly recurring expense of 22 yuan. A travel expense of 2 yuan was added to schools in the war zone, for a total of 24 yuan. In the autumn of the 28th year, prices rose sharply, and living and office expenses were slightly increased. Therefore, the recurring expenses of each school were increased to 36 yuan for schools in the war zone and 30 yuan for schools not in the war zone.</p>

<h3>International Badminton Finals: China Team Retains Championship; Portugal Crushed 0-2; Hong Dequan Wins Men's Singles Championship</h3>
<p>In the Hualaidun International Badminton Finals, China versus Portugal, held yesterday afternoon at the Xieqiao General Assembly Gymnasium, there were also a Maiga performance, as well as the men's singles and women's doubles finals before the match. In the opening Maiga performance, the French Chamber of Commerce faced the Xieqiao Assembly, resulting in a 1-1 tie. Following this, in the men's singles, Hong Dequan faced Yang Jingling to compete for the Shanghai championship. Hong is the runner-up from the previous tournament. His skills are already superb, and his strength is naturally above Yang. However, due to nervousness at the start, he was down 2-8. Hong held his composure and forced it to 7-9, and then he was smooth sailing, finally winning the first game 15-9. In the second game, Yang was already showing signs of fatigue, while Hong fought more and more bravely, seemingly effortlessly, finally winning again 14-4, thus defeating Yang Jingling 2-0 to win the championship. It is commendable that both the champion and runner-up of this year's competition were Chinese players. In the women's doubles final, the international doubles final was the finale. The Chinese representatives were Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji, while the Portuguese team was Xiannaxueer Foye. Hong is known for his bold and decisive style, while Hou is known for his steady and quick playing. They complement each other perfectly, so as soon as they made contact, it became a one-sided affair. As a result, the Portuguese team was crushed 15-4, 15-5, and China defended its championship. The men's doubles, women's singles, and mixed doubles finals will continue at 5:30 this afternoon.</p>

<h3>How to Prepare for Daily Lessons (1)</h3>
<p>— Lu Shaoji</p>
<p>1.  The Heaviness of Daily Homework</p>
<p>Today's young students have a lot of homework, and one person's energy is limited. Without proper guidance, it is difficult to achieve excellent results. In which period is the guidance of young students' studies most important? There is no doubt that it is in the "middle school period" because the daily homework of today's middle school students is too heavy. For junior high school students, there are 15 subjects, including civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, natural history, physiology and hygiene, chemistry, physics, history, geography, manual labor, drawing, music, physical education, and scouts. For senior high school students, there are also 15 subjects, including civics, Chinese, foreign languages, mathematics, biology, minerals, chemistry, physics, history, geography, manual labor, drawing, music, physical education, and military training. Among these many subjects, except for the art and sports subjects, subjects such as Chinese, English, mathematics, nature, and society all need to be prepared for. Moreover, the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics require a lot of preparation time due to the difficulty of learning. Furthermore, the daily homework of middle school students is the foundation for future research in various advanced fields of study. If daily homework can be guided to clarify the path of research, then their studies will be "orderly and without confusion." Therefore, what is said in this article is focused on middle school students. There are few writings in China's cultural circles on the guidance of young people's studies, but the American educator G. M. Whipple has written "How to Study Effectively," and the American educator A. W. Kornhaucer has also written "How to Study," which describes the study methods in detail. Based on the suggestions of the two authors and the author's own opinions, the conditions and methods for young students to prepare for daily homework will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>2.  Conditions for Preparing Homework</p>
<p>Young students want to achieve excellent results in preparing for daily homework and must have the following conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Maintain Physical Health: The efficiency of young people's thinking is related to the efficiency of the central nervous system. If there is a lack of proper exercise, adequate sleep, easily digestible food, or fresh air, the efficiency of the central nervous system will be reduced. In addition, physical defects that hinder nerve activity, such as eye diseases, ear diseases, dental diseases, nasal polyps, and nasal congestion, should not be neglected. Seek medical treatment early.</p>
<p>(2) Constantly Arouse Motives: According to Kornhauser's opinion, "Adiwing Motive" is the main condition for young people to study effectively and is the key to young people's studies. Because if a young person can have this strong desire to control homework, he will be interested in intellectual things and determined in school work. Even if a person's work was very bad in the past, if he now has this motivation, he will be able to change his past lazy and indifferent attitude and strive for enthusiastic and strong efforts, making his future hopeful.</p>
<p>(3) The Working Environment Must Meet the Needs: The environmental conditions during work, such as light, temperature, humidity, clothing, tables, and chairs, must meet the needs. First, try to find a quiet room to prepare homework to avoid various disturbances caused by the eyes and ears. Second, pay attention to whether the light, temperature, and humidity of that room are suitable. The light must never shine directly on the eyes, and reflections from the book surface should be avoided. The temperature should be most suitable at 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Too high or too low will cause various uneasy phenomena. The air must circulate, but there should be no drafts. As for tight clothing, it should not be worn because it hinders physical development and blood circulation. Furthermore, the height of tables and chairs must be suitable for individual needs because too low a table can easily lead to shoulder droop, chest shrinkage, and head swelling. Too high a table is uncomfortable for the arms and can easily lead to nearsightedness. Therefore, the height of tables and chairs must be carefully chosen by individuals.</p>
<p>(4) Application Tools Must Be Fully Equipped: "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." The same is true for young people's studies. When preparing homework, the tools must be complete, such as pencils, erasers, fountain pens, blotting paper, rulers, knives, pens, ink, paper, dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc., must be listed on the desk to make it convenient to "get them with one reach" when in use.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned four conditions—physical, mental, material, and mechanical—are truly indispensable conditions for young people's studies today. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Family, My Home</h3>
<p>— Furan</p>
<p>We five brothers have been living together for five years. Except for me, a bachelor living in the living room of a public place, the rest have wives and children. The way they distribute rooms is based on the order of seniority. For example, the eldest brother, relying on the innate privilege of being born early, naturally occupies the best wing room. That is on the second floor, in the main room, facing south and sitting north, warm in winter and cool in summer. There is also a small platform outside, which is truly the most quintessential place in the entire building. The second brother and the eldest brother are twins, but because they landed two hours apart, he was assigned to live in the main room on the third floor. That room is comparable to the eldest brother's room, except for the lack of that narrow platform. Because of this little dissatisfaction, it aroused all kinds of jealousy from the second brother towards the eldest brother. The third brother's position is even worse. They live in the pavilion rooms on the second and third floors respectively. It is extremely hot in summer and extremely cold in winter. In extremely cold and extremely hot times, it is especially easy to feel the unfairness of the room allocation. As long as there is a spark, it is a family dispute.</p>
<p>When there is a dispute at home, the second, third, and fourth brothers always stand on one side because of the same interests, forming a united front. The eldest brother was scolded anxiously by them, so he used his father's orders to resist their attacks, saying: The allocation of housing and the granting of the power to manage family affairs were entirely from the father's orders and were not obtained by his own request. Indeed, the father's thinking is too old. Five generations living under one roof is the old man's lifelong dream. It was the old man who allocated the housing like this when he left Shanghai, and at the same time gave all the power to manage the family to the eldest brother. The eldest brother holds great power, inevitably domineering some, and the younger brothers are unwilling to give in, so naturally, there will be trouble for no reason, making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p>There are really many children in our family, big and small, a total of ten or so. They, like their fathers, are unwilling to do anything, and spend their days idle, specializing in the skills of flying eaves and walking walls, and drilling holes to eavesdrop. Whenever something happens at home, no matter how secret it is, they cannot escape their ears. They sell the news they have gathered to each other's parents in exchange for more or less rewards. Because there are these benefits, so at dawn, they run up and down the buildings in groups, very busy as if something important is happening. The architecture of our house is not very strong. After a burst of pounding on the stairs, a lot of dust will immediately fall from the ceiling. Especially at mealtime, many cheap MSG are added to the dishes out of thin air, which makes it impossible to eat!</p>
<p>The sisters-in-law are also really good at enjoying themselves. Every day, in addition to eating, drinking, and having fun, they only think about how to use means and how to provoke disputes. As for teaching husbands and children and managing family affairs, it is not within their daily curriculum. Take the eldest sister-in-law, for example. Before dawn, she always eats a bowl of jujube porridge. This porridge is made by simmering jujubes and rice over low heat overnight. It is said that it is very nourishing to eat often. I have no such experience and don't know what the effect is. After eating the porridge, she still lies down to sleep and is unwilling to get up until after noon. Her work in the afternoon is arranged to go to mahjong. But no matter where she plays mahjong, no matter how far the journey is, the bird's nest at half-past four must not be suspended once. At that time, there will always be a nanny who sends the bird's nest that the eldest brother has personally picked to her to eat. If the time it is sent is a little late, and at the same time it happens that her gambling luck is not good, then the eldest brother will be unable to sleep that night because of her. The second sister-in-law is from Suzhou. She has a very good vocal cord. When she speaks, the soft words of Wu are very pleasant to hear. But when she scolds people, she loses this art. She often opens her throat and shouts loudly, and she will not give up until the other party surrenders. She also has a very bad habit of eating irregularly every day. When she doesn't like to eat, she doesn't care if she doesn't eat for a meal: when she is hungry, she can't wait to put chicken, duck, fish, meat, peanuts, dried squid, and the like all into her stomach. Because of irregular eating, she has a very severe stomach disease. The pharmacy near our house is a regular customer of hers. The third sister-in-law used to be a veteran smoker, but now she has "reformed." She is extremely afraid of the heat, and summer is her miserable day. At dawn, she gets up. Sitting in a chair, she mutters and doesn't know what scriptures she is reciting. Behind her, as usual, there is a little maid who beats her back, and each beat must be uniform in speed and moderate in force. If it is a little too heavy, there will be a slap on the little maid's face, and she will be rewarded with a slipper sole, so painfully that she dare not shed tears. The fourth sister-in-law is the youngest, greedy for sleep and fond of alcohol. Every day, she sleeps for a full sixteen hours, and the rest of the time is spent between glasses of wine. When she drinks at night, her husband and children always surround her, reporting to her about what happened at home that day. She drinks wine while thinking about how to deal with it. She is an extremely scheming person, and sometimes the plans she comes up with make people admire her to the point of prostrating themselves!</p>
<p>I really hate this corrupt and decadent home. I hope that one day bombs can explode in nearby squares, so that these drunken and dreamlike people will have a day to wake up.</p>

<h3>Fearsome Death Ray</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Austrian scientist Nikola Tesla, now 84 years old, invented electrical machinery early in his career. He settled in the United States in 1884 and continued his research in electricity, inventing various electric machines.</p>
<p>Recently, Tesla, to repay the friendship of the United States, is working on creating a new electrical machine. He calls this new invention the "Teleforce," a kind of death ray. When the machine is activated, any aircraft within 250 miles in the high altitude, when touched by the electricity, will be immediately destroyed into a solution.</p>
<p>This news was released by Tesla's close friend, W. L. Laurence. Laurence is the science editor of the New York Times, so his words should not be entirely groundless. According to him, this death ray machine includes four new inventions: (1) it can emit this light ray without a vacuum, even in ordinary air; (2) it can emit an extremely strong electric power; (3) it can amplify this electric power; (4) it can generate a very powerful propulsion electricity by a new method. Two of these inventions have already been successfully tested.</p>
<p>Tesla plans to contribute his new invention to the U.S. government, but he has two conditions: the government must raise two million U.S. dollars to set up a "Teleforce" factory (which he says can be built within three months); and everything must be handled entirely by him. If this plan succeeds, the United States will essentially add an unbreakable Great Wall to its national defense. Therefore, Laurence believes that even if the hope of success is slim, it is worth trying.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>"You probably think very little of his book, right?"</p>
<p>"Oh...!" Xiangqi's question diverted his attention from the piece of paper. "Indeed... this... this is the result of Yuan Shaowen's constant encouragement over the years. Alas!...". Speaking of this, a short sigh involuntarily escaped him. "Therefore, this matter of ours is indeed somewhat unfair to him."</p>
<p>"However, he himself originally opposed his uncle!" Xiangqi said very simply, "Although I dare not say he can definitely forgive us, this matter has only a few indirect connections to him, how can you say it's unfair?"</p>
<p>"Because I've always been too cautious in doing things, now that I'm slightly less cautious, I feel much more timid in my heart." Qiuhaitang slowly put the pencil back into the pencil holder, with a very embarrassed expression on his face.</p>
<p>Xiangqi was sitting sideways on the edge of the bed, half her body leaning against the bed railing, hugging her knees, looking up, her eyes fixed on the rows of bricks, silently thinking for two or three minutes.</p>
<p>"What's the use of being timid?" She didn't look at Qiuhaitang, just speaking to herself, "The way we are sneaking around, there's no way to talk about being cautious. We could be exposed at any time. At that time, not only will you have to smooth things over with Yuan Shaowen, but how can we face ourselves?"</p>
<p>Qiuhaitang lowered his head, almost frightened by her words.</p>
<p>"Now your father can't negotiate with him."</p>
<p>"That's not the way to put it!" Xiangqi's gaze finally shifted from the bricks above to him. "Methods aren't fixed. Anyway, you don't have any family ties. It's easy for us to leave."</p>
<p>"Where can we go?" He thought that no matter where he went, people would always point and comment on him on the street, as if his name was stuck on his face, so he couldn't help but wonder where he could go where no one would know.</p>
<p>"Of course, we can't go to big places like Tianjin or Beijing, and I don't like such bustling places at all. Apart from going further south, any nearby village will do. Don't you have a hometown?"</p>

<h3>Secrets of Spies</h3>
<p>— Tingjun</p>
<p>Under Nazi rule, the German government conducted a large-scale anti-espionage campaign, trying to make all Germans vigilantly guard against spies. When movies were shown in cinemas, a warning picture was always shown first, telling everyone to be careful, even with their closest friends, showing a face with a huge index finger placed on the lips, telling people: "Don't make a sound."</p>
<p>It is estimated that European powers spend more than 50 million U.S. dollars annually on espionage work.</p>
<p>Richebourg, the so-called "baby spy," was born around 1758. His body remained as small as when he was born, only two feet tall. This deformed body became invaluable during the French Revolution, because he served as a spy in the army. He often disguised himself as a baby, carried in someone's arms, carrying military secrets, entering and leaving enemy lines.</p>
<p>During the last world war, spies from various countries transmitted various intelligence to their respective armies. The most common information was about the weather.</p>
<p>During the last world war, spies had a very clever way of carrying information, which was to use a pipe, write the information on layers of thin paper, and put it in the wall of the pipe. The spy kept smoking the pipe, and in case of emergency, he lightly twisted the pipe, and the information would be burned along with the tobacco.</p>
<p>In June 1915, a German spy was shot in England. For three months after his death, the German intelligence agency continued to receive "information" from the deceased. Although it was signed by the spy, it was actually sent by a British officer impersonating him. The German intelligence agency was greatly deceived and swindled out of a lot of money.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Life on Venus</h3>
<p>— Ye Han</p>
<p>Venus is 70 million miles from the sun and is the closest planet to our Earth. Recently, according to astronomer H.S. Jones, life on Venus may be just beginning to develop, similar to the situation on Earth millions of years ago, when the first primitive organisms emerged from the slime of the sea.</p>
<p>Although the surface of Venus is covered by thick clouds, astronomers have used spectroscopes to study it and learned that there is no water vapor on Venus. Jones believes that this may be because the atmosphere above the clouds is extremely dry. There is no free oxygen on Venus, but there is more carbon dioxide than on our Earth.</p>
<p>When life began on Earth, there was probably also a lot of carbon dioxide on the ground, and oxygen was relatively scarce. So it seems that Venus now resembles the situation on Earth millions of years ago. However, even if there is life on Venus now, it is only primitive plants. Life may be developing, and after millions of years, when life on Earth has disappeared, life on Venus may be reaching its most advanced stage.</p>
<p>Mars may have had extremely advanced life before, but now there will definitely be no life on it. Because there is no oxygen or carbon dioxide on Mars now. Therefore, Jones said that under such circumstances, it is questionable whether animals can survive. The situation on Mars and Venus is exactly the opposite. Mars now resembles the state of the Earth millions of years later, when all life on Earth has disappeared and most of the gases on the surface have vanished.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Ginger Rogers, Star of "Kitty Foyle"</h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>Recently, two things about Ginger Rogers have been causing the people of Hollywood to stare wide-eyed: first, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in "Kitty Foyle" in 1940; like James Stewart's award, the prognosticators were somewhat disappointed because no one had ever guessed that they would win; second, Ginger is still not married, although she is divorced from Lew Ayres, and Ginger's marriage problem is being hotly discussed in the film city.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about her mysterious romance.</p>
<p>Ginger officially divorced Lew Ayres in March last year, but in fact, the two had already separated. The real reason for the divorce is unknown. General speculation is that Ginger was disappointed with Lew Ayres' obscurity on the screen. Fearing that it would affect Ginger's own future, she was unwilling to live with such an unknown person.</p>
<p>Ginger often hangs out with boyfriends like Howard Hughes, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Lee Bowman, and Bena Nyman, and sometimes even goes in and out with Robert Taylor, who has not yet married Barbara Stanwyck. Thus, Ginger became a great source of material for gossip reporters, but she always said it was just for fun and that she hadn't found the ideal man yet.</p>
<p>Then someone said they saw Ginger standing in the corner of a banquet talking quietly with Lew Ayres, and Ginger got into Ayres' car and they drove away together; news reporters believed that Ginger was still in love with Lew. But their official legal divorce last year shattered all the rumors. News reporters asked Ginger outside the court who she planned to marry, and she said indifferently, "We'll talk about it in a year."</p>
<p>But the whole of Hollywood has been waiting for her for a year. Ginger has no good news, and no one can figure out which male star is her official lover. On the contrary, Ginger has devoted herself to the film business and changed her style. Last year's "Primrose Path" was the beginning of her new style, which was very popular among American women. This year's "Kitty Foyle" established her position on the silver screen.</p>
<p>Rogers' position is now the same as Bette Davis, Garbo, and Norma Shearer, and she should also have the airs of a big star, that is, everything is shrouded in a mysterious color. Even her company doesn't know her travel dates and destinations, and she doesn't talk much, unwilling to have much contact with outsiders.</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers came to Hollywood at the age of twenty-two. She has a strong desire for advancement and a competitive nature, and she wants to do everything very well. Each new film must be better than the previous one. At the age of fifteen, she dropped out of school and participated in local entertainment performances. Her mother also sponsored her to sign with a touring group and perform in big cities.</p>
<p>Ginger finally collaborated with Fred Astaire on many musical films: "The Gay Divorcee", "Flying Down to Rio", "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle", "Shall We Dance", "Top Hat", etc., more than twenty films.

<h3>A Life of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zongyu</p>
<p>You dedicate your entire life to struggle, and at the same time, you stretch your entire life as long as possible. When you should protect yourself, you must protect yourself in order to continue the struggle. Confucius said, "You, if you cannot die a natural death," which means being too fond of bravery and sacrificing your life.</p>
<h3>Blood-Stained Flowers</h3>

<p>Fifth Chapter Red Skirts Envy Pomegranate Flowers</p>
<p>Li Xin was a military officer, but he had never been on the battlefield in his life. At this moment, he plucked up his courage to meet the enemy. He saw the bandits rushing towards him like a whirlwind. Sitting on the lead red-maned horse was a young woman, wearing a peach-red coat, a peach-red battle skirt, and three-inch red embroidered shoes, stepping on the stirrups, slender and petite. Her head was wrapped in a red turban, her face was painted with red rouge, and she held double knives in her hands, with large red silk balls tied to the handles of the knives. Looking at her, everything was red, like a scarlet pomegranate flower, or like the Red Boy of Flaming Mountain. When he looked closely at her face, he almost cried out in surprise. It turned out that this female bandit was none other than the street performer Tong Tianfeng, whom he had met before. He couldn't help but be startled in his heart. When Tong Tianfeng saw Li Xin, she stopped her warhorse, her face full of smiles, and said to Li Xin with a smile, "What a coincidence! Young Master Li, do you recognize me? I am the Red Maiden of Green Stone Mountain. I have come here specifically to find you. If you are willing to come back with me, I will order my subordinates to stop attacking the city and protect the lives of the people in the city." When Li Xin heard her words, fearing that the Magistrate of Qi County would see something suspicious on the city wall, he pointed the broken silver spear in his hand at the Red Maiden and said, "Hey! Who recognizes you, you female thief? Don't spout nonsense. I will capture you and parade your head!" When the Red Maiden saw that Li Xin was unfeeling towards her, she also sneered and said, "Li Xin, do you think you are a member of a noble family and look down on us outlaws? Hmph! Today, your mistress is going to be impolite to you." With that, she waved the double knives in her hand and chopped down on Li Xin's head. Li Xin blocked the double knives with the broken silver spear, and retaliated with a spear, using the Silver Dragon Dividing Water, aiming at the Red Maiden's chest. The Red Maiden swept the left-hand knife downwards, and with a "clang," she had already blocked the spear. Li Xin retracted the spear and thrust the spear horizontally towards the Red Maiden's horse. The Red Maiden tilted the horse to avoid the spear, and also rolled the double knives towards Li Xin's chest. The two of them each displayed their skills and fought on the battlefield. Li Xin was most skilled in spearmanship in his life. He learned the Yang Family Spear, so although the Red Maiden was brave, she couldn't break through him in a hurry. Feeling a little anxious in her heart, she blocked the spear shaft with the double knives, said "How powerful," jerked the horse, jumped out of the circle, and ran away with the horse. Li Xin thought that the Red Maiden was defeated and was about to capture her alive to show off his ability. He squeezed the horse with his legs and chased after her closely. (32)</p>

<p>— Juexin</p>
<p>Kunling Han Suqiu had a miscarriage a month ago, but before a month had passed, she obeyed her parents' orders and returned to the stage of the Dachan Theater, which resulted in postpartum complications. Recently, Suqiu and her parents had another conflict, so she resolutely left her family and moved to New Madrid. This stimulation caused her old illness to recur, and her condition was very serious. Her family members asked a doctor to see her, and it was determined that she had postpartum complications mixed with typhoid fever. If she is not treated well, it is quite dangerous. This is also a page of tears in the history of female actors.</p>
<p>Since Wu Sheng Zhang Erpeng stopped performing at the Kader Theater, he has been working hard at home. Recently, he felt that Shanghai had no place for him to use his talents, and he felt very depressed. He wanted to go to the outer docks to do something. I feel that he is just formally starting out and should be careful about where he goes. Places like Guilin and Kunming need young actors, so he might as well go. I hope he won't leave a lifelong stain on himself due to the impulse of "wanting to be the main character."</p>

<h3>Opening Up the "Devil's Island"</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>France has a "Devil's Island" where criminals are imprisoned, and the prisoners in the island's prison are living a life without hope. The United States has made several films with the "Devil's Island" prison as the background. In order to avoid international disputes, these films only lightly describe the situation in the island's prison. Warner Brothers made a film in 1938 called "Devil's Island," which gave a naked description of the cruel treatment suffered by the prisoners on the island. This aroused French opposition, and the French authorities even threatened to ban Warner Brothers films from being shown in France. Warner Brothers then took back the film "Devil's Island" and didn't even show it in the United States, and the matter subsided. Now that the French situation has changed, Warner Brothers has decided to make another film with "Devil's Island" as the background, called "The Widow of Devil's Island," written by playwright Nigel Smith, and starring the famous Bette Davis. The content tells the story of a woman who commits a crime, and her husband is imprisoned on "Devil's Island" and suffers.</p>
