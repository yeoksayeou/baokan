<h3>日本與三國同盟的再檢討</h3>
<p>德義日三國盟約的簽訂，到前天恰滿一年。記得去年此際的景況，德義沾沾自喜，日本意氣如雲，一若勝利即在目前，瓜分世界的願望立可實現；尤其是外交上久感孤立的日本，竟一舉而得到兩個與國，得意之餘，連近衛松岡都表示過要準備於必要時「表演」三盟約國的軍事力量，中野正剛一流積極端分了更無論已。然而僅僅一年之隔，就已勢異情遷，柏林羅馬之間的互以電文致賀，都只是冷落之中的聊以自娛，東京方面雖然又發出了久已不聞的強化軸心一類口號，却也不能盡掩情緒上的落寞。於是可見在慣以撕毀條約爲事的人，其自身也決不能從締約手段獲致眞實的利益，三國盟約固倖耐水爲蘇德不侵協定之續，其現實的價值何若，則已有這一年間許多的顯著事實可資證明。</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以來，八十年間，其對外運用誠不容否認曾有過重大收穫，然而急功近利，眼光褊淺，且常爲感情及偏見所蔽，在順利的環境當中，尚能應付裕如，一到國際形勢不利，輙不免所如輙左。前次歐戰後的華盛頓會議，是日本在維新以後第一次遭受國際重壓，賴彼時正是憲政的黃金時代，且當局頗能持重，乃能有將近十年的相安無事。「九一八」事變後，日本內有極端份子的刦持，外有一二列強的寬縱，同時更有極權國家以要求改變現勢推翻凡爾賽條約相標榜，日本的大欲乃一發而不可復遏，其外交政策亦即走上投機冒險一途，而以一九三六冬間德日反共公約的簽訂爲嚆矢。當時日本輿論　然，咸認爲遠結不可恃的與國，近惹強大鄰邦（指蘇聯）的激怒，且令民治列強，一致側目，誠非爲之得。以此德方由反共公約進爲軍事同盟的要求，乃因之一再躭延，先後經過了中日戰爭的爆發與平沼內閣的傾圯而迄無結果。如果不是去夏納粹獲勝，英倫阽危，也許三國同盟一舉至今仍難產生。日本在納粹灸手可　之際欣然締盟，雖較義大利之在德法戰役已將成定局之際從事參戰者尚差一間，但同屬投機性質，都是著眼在如何等德國勝利之後分一杯羹。而在德國方面，又正如彼時某西報記者所指出：一個企業，當其正在繁榮獲利的時候，絕不願輕易接納新股，則納粹當日之所以亟謀與日本結納，無寗到是早看到了自身的種種困難，有借重日本力量的必要。是以三國盟約本身，從開始就屬於爾詐我虞互相利用的性質，盟約的實際價值如何，要隨時因國際形勢的演變而予以新的估價，其不能信守不渝，發揮實效，本非盡出意外。</p>
<p>在日本方面，今春有蘇日中立協定的簽訂，最近有對美談判的發動，無論日當局如何解釋，這總是愉和三國同盟的根本精神相背謬的。其實即在盟約成立的同時，日當局就表示過並不因此而放棄對美關係的調整。前日日政府情報局長伊藤發表演說，侈談日本締約以後的供獻，特舉出日本的調解泰越爭執與進兵南越爲例，實際上那都只是滿足了日本自身的慾求，根本無與於三國同盟，更絕不是德國締盟時的內心要求。而德方的垂青日本海軍，希望日方能夠發揮牽制英美的實效，則日方至多僅能放在第二位上去考試，只有如何解除其自身困難纔是當今急務。試看最近美日談話固已不絕如縷，而日政府以及其發言人紀念締盟週年所發表的文告和演說，不是仍舊避免直接刺激英美麼？是以如果當去年此際日人眞曾對於締盟一舉懷有莫大期望，在這一年過程中，此種期望已隨時日代謝而沖淡，並不管其同盟者對此有何感想。</p>
<p>但是日方對三國同盟的冷淡是一一，其仍將挾此自重，並藉以爲對付民治連勝的工具爲又一中，是不容予以混淆的。只是不論此際日本朝野如何一再闡明三國盟約是對外政策的重心，眞正的重心所在却是如何得遂所欲，解除當前困難，盟約不過是手段而已，而且也並不是唯一的手段。如果在民治國方面能夠獲得滿意的優容，則往日尊之如神聖者未必不能棄之如敝屣；惟其此種優容竟不可得，所以擁護軸心的呼聲纔會寂而復熾。當前此日方竭力對美表現種處姿態時，國際間殘存著的綏靖政策曾一度色然以喜，以不使日本脫離軸心也許並非難事；及至東京方面明白表示不改變以三國盟約爲政策基礎，則此輩又復惄然而憂，覺得美日關係已無法改進。其實遠東大局與日本政策，始終都無所變動，所變動者只是綏靖政策者心目中的幻影。直正能使一同盟根本消滅者絕不是樽俎折一的談判或交換條件的讓步，而是中國蘇聯與大西洋三大戰塲戰事的決定勝利，與反侵略聯合陣綫在太平洋的堅決有力行動。時至今日，三國同盟的本身實在已成強弩之末，也更沒有加以過分重視的必要。</p>
<h3>英政府重行檢討　遠東近東政策　保障運輸線當務之急　援華蘇固無分軒輊</h3>
<p>路透社二十八日倫敦電　英國在近車中東及遠東之政策、現在政府之重新檢討中、擬星期日泰晤士外交訪員聲稱、衆信對英軍蘇聯及中國接濟品之運輸問題、在目前內閣之研究中、佔有重要地位、印度英軍總司令華維爾將軍之首要責任、即爲保障通過伊朗之至蘇聯交通綫及此項交通綫在伊拉克與他處之各入口、吾人所負使運蘇接濟品到達目的地之責任、戰事內閣之極爲重視、現時經過伊朗之通蘇聯各交通綫如其不敷應用、則中國各生命綫亦何嘗不然、美專家現正從傍協助以維持緬甸公路之暢通、惟該路之運貨能力最大爲每月四萬噸、而以前之滇越公路及鐵道則爲七萬五千噸、仰光方面現堆積大批待運貨物、必須設法運出以容納續到之新貨、若干建築中國與緬印間新交通綫之計劃、已在原則上爲英政府所接受、此項新交通綫包括補充緬甸公路之鐵道、以印度爲起點之公路及航空運輸綫、</p>

<h3>沈有乾博士講　「思考之訓練」</h3>
<p>闡發思考二字要隨機應變本市學術講座、昨日舉行第十一决演講、敦請工部局華人敎育處副處長沈有乾博士主講、講題爲「思考之訓練」、沈氏對於教育心理學允多心得、所以慕名前往聽衆、座爲之滿、茲經大華社記者摘錄講詞、概要如决、</p>
<p>一、思想之與思考平時我們都知道、轉念爲「思想」、而不用「思考」、不過日常所調思想的意義很含糊、所指不一、包括回憶·聯念·希望·猜測等、所以改用「思考此較明瞭、思考並不是亂想必需有創造性的、就是要有新的發見、在他本人以爲是新創的、須合乎事實、思考的時候、要利用思想上的方法、不過須要有目的、以及反省的、或批評的、</p>
<p>二、思考在人生地位蕭伯納說、「人類不單用思想、而更用思考」、若人類不能思考、便不能適應如此複雜的環境、因爲動物最簡單的方法、是用「本能」的、本能是用一種遺傳的適應性、呆板不變、單用本能是很可笑的、而思考須要隨機應變、比本能進一步的是「習慣」、習慣是適應情境的行爲、動物亦能訓練養成習慣、如已養成習慣、再要改變便很難了、常常習慣剛成、情境已變、所以亦是很呆板、不够應用的、還有「模仿」亦是舊的一種方法、如大家用模仿、則人類文化不能進步了、祇知跟隨別人，便不能創造新的、所以在個人雖新、在全體仍舊、且有模仿錯誤及不當、便覺可笑、遝有「試誤」、如一個問題不能解決、而又無可模仿、便亂試各種方法、或幸而適台的、但大半都是失敗、有時一次試騐已失收、便不能繼續第二决、這是很盲目、不經濟、尙有危險性、所以要經濟地達到解決、唯一要靠思考了、思考是有計劃性、有創製性、與本能習慣模仿不同、與「試誤」亦有程度上的分別、所以人類一切都須用思考的、思考時先有想像中計劃、然後再去做、（未完）</p>

<h3>平準會與上海黑市</h3>
<p>— 孟家莫譯</p>
<p>從重慶的官塲而言，所有上海外匯買賣其匯率低於戰前的匯率時，都屬黑市交易。中一國貨幣眞正的法定匯率依舊維持在英鎊一先令二辦士半，美金三角；這法定的匯率是訂定在一九三五年中國貨幣改革的時候，比了現在上海的匯率英鎊的高出了四倍以上，美金幾及六倍。但在自由中國區內，中國政府銀行對進出口商另外訂有較戰前匯率爲低的「商業匯率」，如在重慶昆明等處，政府對於收購外匯，都有更低的匯率。中國政府經年來亦假手於中英平準基金會及其政府銀行在上海維持比法定匯率低落得很多的匯率，到現在這新的管理貨幣平準基金會又來竭力維持上海的匯市，訂定了新的官價，就是國幣一元可得美金五·三一二五分。</p>
<p>但是目前所談到的上海黑市，在銀行家和一般人士的意識中，並不即指前節所述低於戰前匯率的外匯買賣，這種父易，在嚴格的法定意義上，固巳屬爲黑市。現在我們所謂的上海黑市，是從英美荷印凍結日本資金以後，凡在十四家有經營外匯執照的外商銀行，或與中央銀行合作的華商銀行以外所執行的外匯交易，這類交易的匯率，大的比平準會所訂定的低落十分之一；這黑市的存在，將來會威脅着上海整个的商業。但是這黑市是吾會繼續存在呢？是吾牠對於上海商業將永久霸佔着一個重要的地位呢？除了向頒有執照的銀行或平準會按官價結匯以外，將仍允許利用這黑市給進出口商人和英美荷印各國進行貿易呢？</p>
<p>上海的黑市是何由而生？第一點：就因爲上海有大量美鈔的流通，這種美鈔只須費去較少費用，就可裝運到美國去，並且牠們可以自由存入銀行存戶內，購售非常自由，甚至亦有遠期交易，所以美鈔每元的價格較平準會官價的費二元至二元五角左右。但是英鎊鈔票却相反地比平準會每鎊等於國幣七十六元的官價的低去二十五元或百分之三十三，理由是英鎊鈔票不得自由流入英鎊集團區域去，並且除特殊情形外本地英商銀行及公司等亦拒絕接受，故英鎊鈔票在黑市中就不及美鈔那樣珍貴了。</p>
<p>其次對於黑市外匯的供給，還有許多英美銀行在七月二十六日實施凍結令以前所出的匯票，有許多票據在美國的付款銀行還是可以照付，不過因爲其中許多款項總究變成了凍給的資產，所以牠們的價値比本身就是現金的美鈔略低。此外還有許多本票和匯款，在凍給前由美國寄送到上海來的持有這類外匯票據的人大都不向與平準會合作的銀行兌款，而轉向黑市脫售，因爲貪得較大的匯價。</p>
<p>最後黑市內還有鉅數出口匯票的供售。上海有許多出口商：或是屬於全能國家的國籍，或是用自己資金經營貿易的，或是不倚賴於平準會不和頒有執照的銀行相往來的，就在黑市中出售他們的出口票據，所得的國幣可較售與平準會多百分之十至十五。在最近幾星期內黑市外匯交易的來源，大都是這些出口票據的供售。</p>
<p>至於黑市外匯的買方：第一根本就是不能向平準會申請結款的進口商，或是不能得到充分外匯供給的商人；允其是對於那些進口商，他們的貨運巳到達了上海，亟須將全部貨款付請後始可提貨，或是貨運業巳從外斷裝出，正在赴滬途中，他們可不必過慮到向黑市所購的外匯，不會因英美荷印當局禁止貨運出口而沒有了用途。其他黑市外匯的買有：出售地產的外僑，不厭於存儲外幣的收藏家和極少極少的投機家，有許多還很想信把資金凍結在美國，是一種最安全的投資。</p>
<p>目前平學會當然在與黑市搏鬥中。如向平準會可取得外匯各銀行都一致退出了黑市；進口商向平準會申請取得外匯以後，如發現其再在黑市中交易時，平準會將不再織續供給；經營外匯各銀行必須正直不阿，擔保由平準會取得之外匯不使流入黑市。對於這點，平準會還努力在斷絕黑市的主要供源。堅持凡向平準會取得申請權利的商人，如有出口匯票應按其官價售予頒有執照的各銀行，又在該各銀行經營出口貿易的行家，應强迫其將出口票據按官價結售。</p>
<p>此外對於在上海流通的英美荷印各國貨幣應予制止，叉遭三個國籍的幾家銀行所出的新滙票，不准任其在黑市中交易，這種方案，荀能實行，對於杜絕黑市外匯的來源，是很可見效的。平準會還可用其他方策來取締黑市交易；平準會當局司請華盛頓倫敦及巴達維亞政府的合作對上海運往的貨運頒用一律的執照，就是明白規定非將這種貨運所得的外匯貨款，即按平準會官價結售予指定銀行外，是不准進口的。平準會又可商請美國當局從某日起即仿英國先例禁止美鈔自由流通，並不准在美國國境以外之美商銀行收受此種美鈔。</p>
<p>對於上海黑市的觀察，似乎非常的黯淡。這ＡＢＣＤ民主國家對上海的貿易是有權限制必須依照平準曾官價，經山頒有執照的十四家銀行經營方可進行，其餘這幾個民主國家和上海間的貿易，除非有走私以外，可以完全隔絕。上海美鈔的價値可請美政府的制裁，使其貶落至平準會官價以下。凍結以前發出之滙票亦可加以統制。這樣各種方案設能並行實施，可使黑市外滙的來源，頓吿斷絕，而上海的商人亦可不再傍徨，如其不與平準會合作，朋祇能立時停止其對英美荷印各國問的貿易。（譯自九月二十日密勒氏評論報John　Ahler原作）</p>
<h3>烚赤投機新標的　香港金市與申匯</h3>
<p>— 華勝</p>
<p>變成無主幽魂</p>
<p>平準會得英美政府合作，切實集中本市外匯供需，穩定供給匯率後，賴美匯升降而得構成之烚赤金市，從此亦失其標的。因匯價穩定，由匯價折合之金價自亦呆定，投機行爲；無從進行。過去每日交易常在數萬乃至十萬條以上的烚赤投機市塲，於是蕭條萬狀，每日交易不及一百條。悽凉可知。</p>
<p>金市波動，匯價上落，原爲威脅一般物價之兩大惡魔。近年物價在漲，平民生計苦不勝言，原因雖多，要亦受始赤及外匯投機者所賜。平準會今以一箭雙鵬之法，同時消滅，功超七級浮圖。然金匯投機者心猶不死，力圖挽回殘局，希藉法意銀行之活動，重開黑匯門戶，然英美匯源流旣根本杜塞，法意銀行叉無實力可言；則彼之掙扎，不過枉費心機。雖金蟲亦知其大勢巳去。故想人非非，本月二十日決定今後的烚赤期貨，十月起改用港匯結價。然此項結價方法，能吾持久？仍屬問題。試先一述香港之金市與匯市。</p>
<p>香港金貨市場</p>
<p>香港金市塲設在上環孖沙街十四號；英文稱Ｃhinese　Money　＆　Gold　Excbange，以經營生金銀及各國金銀貨幣之買賣爲主要業務。有會員二百四十六家，每日早晚兩市，每市兩盆，早市初盆（即初盤）於下午十二時十五分，二盆十二時半，晚市初盆下午五時五十五分，二盆五時半，土日兩曜無市。金貨主要交易物品向分：（一）金條，（二）一二金，（三）八九金，（四）四四金四種；依倫敦純金及鎊匯結價。自英國固定金價於八鎊八先令，又固定港稱一元合英金十五便士後，香港金市，亦被統制於無形。</p>
<p>上舉四種主要交易物品，有略加說明之必要。港市過去之金貨投機，向分三部分，即英金貨，美金貨，及生金貨。英金貨又分金塊及二一金，前者所做者爲倫敦純金，依匯豐掛牌及路透社電報進行，或在倫敦交割，或在本港了結。歐戰後此種交易巳不可能。二一金即英國面値一鎊之金幣，計重合華量二錢一分三厘，故有二一金之稱。第一决歐戰後，該項硬幣，已停止流通。港方此種交易，不過投機與窖藏。因現貨短缺，故亦無交易可言</p>
<p>美金貨有金塊及八九金，四四金之別。金塊即紐的純金，交易方法與經營倫敦純金同。美國統制金市後，此項交易，亦已不復存在。八九金及四四金，均係美國金幣，八丸金一稱花期大金，面値美幣二十元之硬幣，每枚重量合華制八錢九分三厘三，故各。四四金一稱花旗金，面依美幣十元之硬幣，每枚重合華制四錢四分六厘六，簡稱四四金，均按美純金價及港美匯率折算。英金交易不能進行後，港島投機者乃側重八九金投機，儼然爲香港金市交易之中心。後因籌碼不足，一九三一年九月後，改以四四金代替。</p>
<p>金條係金號出品；與銀樓之飾金，同爲港島本金交易。金條叫價單位每盎司計算，飾金叫價單位每華兩計算，價格原追隨八九金及今之四四金轉移。嗣經香港政府予以管理，規定純進每盎司合港幣一四〇元後，至今即呆定不動。</p>
<p>香港申匯市場</p>
<p>上海金蟲，失其投機目標，變成無主幽魂港金金條價格不變。原不適爲投機根據；金蟲之所以選擇港金為結價標準，醉翁之意不在酒，而在港申匯市近年因港申貿易關係頻繁，港府對於申滙之統制，又旋緊旋鬆，方針不定；因之滙率頻變，起伏至鉅，於是成爲滬上金蟲雀屏之中　。</p>
<p>香港之申滙交易，一九二六年起，集中於香港南北行　（即文咸西街）口　　道西三十六號聚德隆行舖面進行，每晨八時半至九時半爲買賣時間現有會員百餘家。市價以每港幣百元合法幣若干計算。目前申滙市况，每港幣百元，於合法幣四百六十餘九左右，而去年此際，不過四百一二十元。</p>
<h3>終將枉費心機</h3>
<p>現在烚赤市塲，規定以香港金條及申滙作爲結價標準，從下月起實行。其法已載二十日本報商業新聞，要點：</p>
<p>（一）香港純金（即金條）每盎司官價一四〇港元，每盎司合市秤〇·九九五三兩；即九·九五三市兩，等於港幣一·四〇〇元。</p>
<p>（二）上海烚赤每條十市兩，成色千分之九九二；每條烚赤之純金，等於九·九二市兩，依港金價折算，則每條烚赤等於一三九五四〇港元，此爲定歡，復以申滙價除此定數，即作上海烚赤每月底結價之標準，其算式爲：</p>
<p>目前申滙之多變，原因有二：（一）港地法幣對港幣之比價，賤於上海法幣對港幣的比價。故港地投機者，大事套滙，即以港地法幣運滬出售，購進上海市塲上之港幣回港；換進法幣而再運滬，再在滬換進港幣而回港，如此套買，逐取其差益，於是港地申滙，與上海港滙，同時多變，上項套滙，如屬運送現鈔，則均走私，因港方對法幣出口，早加限制。（二）香港之匯兌統制法令，雖亦適用申　；但為維持港申貿易，允中國政府之請，故較寬大，因之投機者亦得從中活動，港地申匯因之乃起伏不定</p>
<p>上海抽機者今之改採港金及申匯結價，除挽回投機殘局外，亦具政治作用。因港府對於申匯，隨時可與中國政府合作，加緊其統制。一經統制，難免促成申匯之縮風；自非華商所樂聞。今烚赤依港金申匯結價，（一）以國府及港府對申匯均無意加緊統制，故市價多變，烚亦投機得因之而茍延。（二）如港府及國府加緊統制，則直接促成申匯縮風，間接抑低法幣幣値，同時使自由區中國未能充分利用港申貿易關係，取得上海物質之供給。誠不愧為用意深長，亦可謂一石二鳥之舉。</p>
<p>然港府及國府今日之所以比較放任港申匯兌，其故亦有二：即（一）平　會管理上海匯市，至少在目前已告成功；故港地法幣之流滬，於中國雖非得計，但已不致授人套買外匯以方便。（二）港申匯市比較自由，則港申貿易　可活潑；此於自由區之物資需要，自屬有利。</p>
<p>但自江寗方面宣倒貼禁止物資出口，與日軍加緊對自由中國港口之封鎖，雖香港在外，情勢亦已變化。國府及港府對於港申貿易之維持，已失其意義；因之對於港申匯兌之維持，亦同時失其意義。加以港申匯市之投機，將因烚赤結價關係而益形擴大。因之難保平凖會不與港府合作，以今日管制美英匯兌之辦法，施之於港申匯市。故此種結價方法，其能茍延多時？未可樂觀也。</p>
<h3>汽油分配卡</h3>
<p>— 豆</p>
<p>事離開上海，畸形繁榮抵消了一般發國難財人們心頭的戰爭　　：雖則到處在　絲網門　碰壁，到處看到被高物價踐踏着的饑餓羣眾們倒在路畔；但是汽車行得太風駛電閃了，這種印象不會在他們腦上多得多久。</p>
<p>物價飛漲，一般人壓得呻吟不已，汽車階級依然過着金錢萬能的福。有錢怕什麼？上海果然是孤島，但只要有輪船到，有了錢就不怕買不到東西。輪船多少是不會停止的，英美的商輪减少了，還有日本的商輪哩！</p>
<p>嘻！他們真沒有想到：在這戰火漫天的時代，金錢萬能畢竟會受到真實物資之試騐的。儘管你有船，儘管你有用不完的錢，但沒有實真的東西，那都沒有用。</p>
<p>現在照樣有輪船到，錢幣照樣受人迷戀，可是汽油的購買，却要受到限制了。要汽油，須先領到分配卡；有人還以為這是　約外匯的結果，實際完全不是這一回事。主要，的這　事的血液，生產國家雖有無眼的富源，也得講求節省輸出，留　　要之需。而且英美等正在禁油連日，如果放任上海汽油的進口，禁油便無　義。這兩個原因，便是這次限制汽油而實行分配卡的最大原因。而一般忘了　爭的人們，從此將恢　其戰爭的印象了吧？</p>

<h3>汽油分配制實行　嚴格限制用量　消耗量可節省五分之二　油同時核减</h3>
<p>據調查、全市私人汽車爲一萬二千輛（公共租界七千輛法租界九千輛）、卡車爲四千輛、機器脚踏車爲八百輛（公共租界五百輛法租界三百輛）、今日起如未獲得「派油證」、將無法獲得汽油、茲記各公司所採措施如下、</p>
<p>憑證購油</p>
<p>（一）自今日起、憑證購油、各加油姑對其他主顧、一律停止供給、（二）各加油站憑「派油證」上規定數量供給汽油、不得超過、每决最大限度、不得超過十加侖、（三）目前因缺乏運油船隻、各公司爲設法使現存汽油能儘量延長供應時間起見、除採取跟制辦法外、尙無其他善策、如將來情形能逐步改善、當通知取消此種限制、</p>
<p>辦法嚴格</p>
<p>（四）油量分派、概根據直接環境、目下所分派數量、容有再須核减之舉、倘果如此、當在日報上發表一切情形、及應核减之百分率、於十一月一日、另發新派油證、屆時須將舊證繳還、掉換新證、（五）所發之派油證、不准抵押轉讓、各加油站祇出售汽油與派油證上註明照會之號碼之汽車（六）車輛業巳停止使用時、務請將派油證繳回、倘更換照會號碼、或遷移住址、亦希立即備函知照、以便備案、（七）每决購買汽油時、務須將派油證交與加油站之管理員、以便其在該證上將所購之油量、用鉗軋去、以　鑑別、（八）購置汽油、概須現金、（九）汽油公司對於發給此項新證、概不負有仟何義務、對於供給新證之全部油量、亦不担保、</p>
<p>今後消耗</p>
<p>據記者獲悉、普通中型汽車主人雖申請每月需要三十或四十加侖汽油、但公司當局核准者、僅爲二十三加侖、每日一加侖尙不足、故如每天在行駛之决數稍多、即有不敷之感、又悉、各大油公司自今日起、並將派員至各加油站檢查每日站油之存量及消耗數量、據某汽油商之大的估計、派油證實施後、各大公司每日售出之數量、的計六千加侖左右、在汽油未　限制前、每日的爲三萬加侖左右、此項限額分配制實行後、售出之汽油、僅及牛時五分之三、又英商公共汽車用油、亦自今日起核减百分之二十、</p>

<h3>麥賽坊房客　反對分宅出售　此風不截戢將使民不聊生</h3>
<p>法租界麥賽而帝羅路麥賽坊全體房客、因不堪業主之壓迫、及「分幢出售」在潮襲擊起見、昨特具函各界、認爲在此刦後孤島、人口激增、覓屋萬分困難之際、而一般房地產之投機商、竟不惜以通神之妙手、作轉讓之幻衛、逼迫遷居、籍端加租、因此全市之承租人、陷於極度恐慌中、影響整個社會、貽害人民生計、殊非淺鮮、</p>
<p>喘息生存</p>
<p>此後凡住居衖堂房屋者、勢將人人自危、况承租人大都有决承租小之關係、而承租人中、更不乏小本商店、遷移店址、尤非事實所許、萬一影響其營業、不啻間接威脅其生計、牽一發而動全身、其所引起之不良後果、有非筆墨所能書也、哀我小民、方喘息生存於物價空前之掙扎中、今又發生此嚴重之居住問題、尙何安居樂業之望耶、</p>
<p>有碍公安</p>
<p>同人等對此騷擾大多數市民、有碍公衆安寗之投機事業、惟有一致奮起、反對到底、除聯合全市被壓迫各里衖房客、呈請兩租界及司法行政當局、秉公救濟、以謀澈底解決、而實現民法第四百廿條之保障外、茲同人等不揣譾陋、謹就管見所及、特提供數點於下以作公開之討論</p>
<p>投機圖利</p>
<p>（一）分宅出售房屋、本屬合法之房屋產交易、豈容旁人妄加干涉、但邇來流弊窮、其結果卒為收回自用、逼迫遷讓、恫嚇欺騙、無所不用其極、故此等房產買賣、純屬投機圖利、不能認為正當營業、應各各界注視此點、設法制止、以免將來續有發生、</p>
<p>徒滋糾葛（二）分宅出售之房星、須注意該屋是吾台宜於分宅之必要條件，查普通衖堂房子、不特屋頂墻壁建築相連、即一切公用之路燈水管公街等、亦屬無法分開、此等房屋而分宅出售、則將來客堂樓灶披間亦可分間出賣矣、其徒滋糾葛、不難想見、故邇來報紙所載之多數衡堂房屋、如同人等現所居住之麥賽坊等、絕對不宜於分宅出售、</p>
<p>設法制止</p>
<p>（三）分宅之弊書、旣如上述、足以引起全市居民之重大恐慌、故此事非單純之房屋糾紛、實爲整個之社會問題、應請兩租界及司法行政當局、有以設法制止、或請主管當局、成立「房屋糾紛委員會」、處理此項糾紛、以維民生、而安　會、實爲市民所切要需望也、</p>
<p>顧全民意</p>
<p>（四）函請租界法院｜以後對於此類訟案、不妨稍稍顧全民意、此實最有效之唯一辦法、此舉非人民干涉司法、況歷來法院判決、大都有利於承租人、已為市民所共見、今須補充者、此等業主、刁狡非常、起訴時往往利用承租人之些微弱點、各個擊破、單獨進行、使承租人防不勝防、法院為所朦蔽、一旦訴勝、則法律災其利用此宜深切戒備者也</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>林肯家庭恨史之一頁</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>不得已的散步</p>
<p>林肯生前，時常帶領着一個孩子出去散步，在他結婚以後的二十二年中，常常如此。他愛散步嗎？也許是的；然而最在的原因，是和他的太太，發生爭吵。他的太太的脾氣是很壞的，不論傭婦，送水的人或送貨人都會受到痛罵，在大半的情形之下，林肯是往往被屈服的。在起初的時候，他只是一笑置之，但是笑不能停止伊的發脾氣，所以在後來的幾次，他就以散步為對付的方法；然而等到他回家，呼鬧又開始了。</p>
<p>林肯的結婚生活，實在是很不幸福的，他的太太，出身富家，是當地的一個交際花，具有「能使一個牧師忘記他的祈禱」的魔力，愛好修飾，濫用金錢，而林肯是一個家境貧寒，完全靠自己努力奮鬥而成功的偉人。</p>
<p>夫婦間彼此的性格不同，自然要發生種種磨擦，所以靑年男女在擇偶的時候，應該仔細研究對方的性格屈，決不能草率從事。同時我們更可以知道林肯的偉大，他雖處於煩惱的環境之下，依舊能够做出一番豐功偉績。享受着幸幅的結婚生活的夫婦，應該怎樣努力，以求造法人類啊！</p>
<p>再進一步說，如果林肯的太太能够了解林肯的偉大，而予以最大的合作，那末林肯造福人類的功續，一定更多而更爲驚人了，我想。</p>
<h3>關於我們的身體</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>一個人的身體裹，有充足的電，可以燃點一隻二十五瓦特的燈泡至三分鐘之久。</p>
<p>從我們的頭髮，可以看出血液有沒有疾病，如果血液流通失常或是有貧血症的人，往往頭髮是沒有光彩的。</p>
<p>大多言語上的疾病，是在三歲到八歲之問造成的，所以兒童在學話的時候，應該注意</p>
<p>恐懼的心理，足以影響血液的循環，二使皮膚緊張，所以因恐懼而使毛髮直立，在事實上是可能的。</p>
<p>憂慮和恐懼，足以使齒牙蛀壞，最近有個美國人，在三星期中蛀掉了九隻牙齒，因爲在那個時期裹，他的妻子患着重病。</p>
<p>我們在睡着的時候，頭腦收縮，而身體　張，因爲血液大部份流到身處的其他各部份去了。</p>
<p>因爲我們皮膚上酸性，各人不同，所以有些人更能吸引蚊蟲臭蝨，而有些人根本不會受到它們的噬咬。</p>
<p>我們的唾液和胃液，是身體中最靈效的殺菌劑。</p>
<h3>未來父親訓練所</h3>
<p>— 李思華</p>
<p>美國紐約的產婦中心脅會，為着　障產婦和嬰兒的安全起見，特地組織了一個未來父親訓練所，一羣行將做父親的男子，在那裏受到訓練，訓練的課程中，包括爲蠟製的玩隅洗澡的一課。</p>
<p>這一個新興事業的舉辦，是因爲在美國全國每年因生產而死亡的人，不下一萬個，（在世界上根據說是最多，挪戚的產婦死亡率最低，每千人中佔着二·六個）而生下來的嬰兒，全年有二百二十五萬個，其中七寓五千個是生下來就死去的。</p>
<p>因此美國的男子的責任，就無形中加多了，他們不能爲了能够担負家庭的費用就算是盡責了，他們等到妻子受孕以後就要受到做父親的準備和訓練。</p>
<p>在訓練期閒，一個水來的交親，要做到下列幾件事：</p>
<p>一，在妻子受孕滿三個月之前，伴著去看醫生。</p>
<p>二，陪伴妻子到近處去散步，使伊得到充足的空氣和運動。</p>
<p>三，因爲孕婦走到外面，容易受人注視，應該帶領妻子到人少的地方去。</p>
<p>四，所有嬰記所需的東四，從事準備。</p>
<p>五，學會替嬰兒洗澡的方法。</p>
<p>六，在生產的幾個月之前，把接生的發院或醫生接洽妥當。</p>
<p>七，在嬰兒誕生以後，家庭中的生活，就要從此改變了，允其是在第一個嬰兒誕生的時候，做父親的就要担任比較粗笨的工作。</p>
<p>八，每天要分出一些時閒，去和嬰兒遊戲。</p>
<h3>主婦摘記</h3>
<p>曾被夏季污漬損污的衣服，可以用　水洗濯，汗漬就能除去。</p>
<p>在墻上敲釘，往往要損壞墻上的油漆，但如果你先把釘浸在熱水裏，然後再敲，就可以不成問題。</p>
<p>在煤爐燒得過熱的時候，用　散在煤上，就可以减除火熖。</p>
<p>要使已鈍的剪刀犀利，可以用剪刀把一張大沙皮剪成一張張小沙皮，剪過以後，剪刀也就鋒利起來了。</p>
<p>把蛋放入碗中以後，加一點食鹽，打蛋的工作，較爲順利。</p>
<p>要使燈泡發最大的光度，時常用略潮的布揩拭，是一個很好的方法。</p>
<h3>懸掛鏡框的正當方法</h3>
<p>從一個人所懸掛的鏡框，就可以看出他的個性來，一個愛好運動的人，他一定會懸掛幾張運動的照片，一個愛好戲劇的人，他所用以裝飾的鏡框，就要以戲劇爲題材了。</p>
<p>然而普通一般人在懸掛鏡框的時候，都用一個鈎子，因此在懸掛鏡框的綫就成爲三角形（如圖）。其實正當的方法應該要照左面圖畫中所示的方法，因爲這樣可以與房屋的錢條相配，比較地美觀得多。</p>
<h3>小統計</h3>
<p>— 倩英</p>
<p>上海每幢房了都有臭蟲，</p>
<p>全市民的計五百萬人，</p>
<p>每人每晚被臭蟲吸去的血的一西西，</p>
<p>共計每晚被臭蟲吸去的血興一擔水相等；若將全市的臭蟲統統捉起來，</p>
<p>可裝火車數輛。</p>

<h3>合理的節制</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>電力公司對於用戶訂定限制辦法後，現在汽油公司對於用油，發給購油證，也正實施逐步管制。本來在這個國難求巳，大家節制些物質慾，自屬天經地義，可是用戶中明瞭這一點的，固然不少，而感覺不便的，難免還有人在，其實太太購物，少爺上學，動輒要費外滙來易取汽汕，以資代步，已非今日所應有的現象。這次汽油的管制，應該是對過去未能自動節的者的是個良好的督促。</p>
<p>中秋節快到了，當然有不少人未能免俗，其實呢？「共看明月應垂淚」，「但悲不見九州同」，誰都何忍浪費金錢，放縱徵逐。就是幸而經營獲利，何莫非社會上一般人呻吟宛轉所付與，那末受之於社會的，如能爲社會謀福利，方是上策。吾則，至少亦不應造成奢風，貽害社會。</p>
<p>與其奢也寗儉，希望上海市民，積極的節的，自助助人，心有靈犀，盡各人應盡之責，不要爲習俗所囿。要知今日吾人節的的一分財力，就是培養吾人將來的幸福。</p>
<h3>張叔通之滑稽新聯語</h3>
<p>— 淸凈</p>
<p>我友張叔通先生，工書善畫，上追董源，下逼玄宰，儒家之畫，確與畫家之畫不同。先生風流瀟灑，共胸中直如光風霽月，絕不染半點塵埃，故其畫亦淸超絕俗，與今之烏燜瘴氣者大異其趣，近來要求先生書畫者踵接，因此杜門謝客，專作書畫，一切不聞不問，已數年於茲矣。先生叉好雅謔，不拘之於繁文縟節，叉似鄭板橋李笠翁一流人物，今先生年巳六十又五，觀其戲作自壽一聯，及爲人所書之聯，已可見先生風趣之一斑：</p>
<p>仰天大笑，笑虛度六十餘年，飯袋酒囊，居然消費不少；顧影自憐，憐昂藏七尺之表，波隨流逐，毫無建樹奈何</p>
<p>晝花寫字讀古今書十分有一趣；煮茗吸烟談俏皮話亦足怡情。</p>
<p>此地只談風月，不談政事，倘熱中人，務請免開尊口；</p>
<p>室內旣有花木，叉有琴書，如高雅士，不妨時常光臨。</p>
<p>到處爲家，坐固可，臥亦可，絕無半點拘束；少安母躁，旣來之，則安之，儘可隨意閒談。</p>
<p>無俗韵，無囂塵，獨處閒居，入我淡懷秋月白；有琴書，有花木，窗明几凈，迎人爽氣遠山靑。</p>
<p>此地雖湫溢塵囂，幸有那書畫琴棋，儘可隨爾消遺；座上多通儒碩彥，如談些風花雪月，亦足擴我襟懷。</p>
<p>君來乎，無任歡迎，宇宙之大，蒼蠅之微，小妨隨便討論；客悶否，儘有辦法，花草養心，詩書養氣，儘可恣意消磨。</p>
<p>流水高山寄興於風塵而外；聽香讀畫賞心在能妙之間。</p>
<h3>玻璃剌傷車夫</h3>
<p>— 一個讀者</p>
<p>這事在我們弄堂裹發生已不止一次了—黃包車夫的脚被碎玻璃片刺破。</p>
<p>說起來，這眞不對，弄堂裹面明明有垃圾車，有些人家却偏把亂七八糟的東西傾在門口，碎的玻璃片自然也毫不經心地隨手丟出來，我眞不知道那些人看見那可憐者流血的脚和痛苦的呻吟時，會不會想到自已是禍首。</p>
<p>昨天，我回家時，看見一個黃包車停在我家門口，車夫在不遠一家門口坐着，對門一個善心的老太太在替他把碎的玻璃片拿出來，把脚包紥好，但血仍從布中淌出來，那車夫可憐地訴說着，「車是從英租界租來的，一天要三塊多錢，這决拉一個羅宋人來，只有兩毛多錢，却把脚刺傷了，倒霉！」我進來對母親說母親叫我拿兩毛錢給他，但兩毛錢能幫助他他嗎？雖然，別人也都給錢，但他也許有妻子兒女呢，人家給他的錢，也許連車租還不够呢。</p>
<p>（編者按）在路上，這類痛心疾首的事情數見不鮮。碎玻璃有，香蕉皮瓜皮等等更多。棄之者固輕而易舉，不幸踐踏跌仆，而身受重傷者却受累無窮。有人把這類害人東西撥向路邊，正是件公德的事。</p>

<p>可是不等他們的弟兄下鄕去，趙玉崑已在當晚悄悄地走回來，把自己所做的事全告訴了秋海棠，並且還很詳細地敎他見了孟老掌櫃家裹的人應該怎樣說，假使有警察來詢問又應該怎樣回答，因此他簡直是早花家裏候着了。</p>
<p>第三天嚮午，北河鎭警察分局果然派了一位巡官二名警察趕到樟樹屯來了，他們第一就找到秋海棠家裏去，裝出怪嚴重的神氣，盤問了許多話。</p>
<p>秋海棠的精神這兩點　已好得多了。「三位先生，現在總該輪到我說話了吧。」他坐在坑上，很謹愼地答復了他們許多問話以後，便突然把臉色一沉，大着胆，把玉崑敎他的話一齊背誦了出來。「他們孟家丟人的事，我有病在家，實在一些不知情。不過，我可以另外報告你們一件事，那就是我的女兒已在三個多月前給孟家的一個親戚拐走了……。」</p>

<p>李用和，宸妃之弟，據宋魏泰所記，「李太后入掖庭纔十餘歲，用和年方七歲，太后臨別，以手結刻絲繋囊與之，拊背泣曰：汝雖淪落顚沛，不可失此囊，異時我若遭遇，必訪汝，此爲物色也。後用和傭於鑿紙錢家常以囊懸於胸臆問。一日，苦下痢，勢將不救，爲紙錢家棄於道左。有入內院子者見而憐之，收養於家，怪共衣服百結，而胸懸擊囊，因問之，具以告，院子惄然驚異，蓋常奉命於太后，令物色訪其弟也。院子復問共姓氏小字世系甚悉，遂解其囊，明日入示太后，及具道本末，是時太后封宸妃，己生仁宗，聞之悲喜，遂以其事白眞宗，遂官之。」</p>
<p>按此係宋人筆記，尚與史書不符者有多處，（一）其時之太后非李妃，而爲劉后。（二）訪之者爲劉后，而非李妃本人，且仁宗已即位，故劉后遺劉美張懷德爲訪李妃親屬，魏泰謂以事白眞宗大誤，蓋眞宗已逝世矣。（三）李妃之對爲宸妃，巳在疾革時。而訪尋李用和，乃在仁宗即位之初也。惟一點相同，史亦稱李用和少窮困，居京師，　紙錢爲業，劉美求甩和於民間，奏爲三班奉職也。及仁宗知爲李妃子，推恩外戚，官至彰信軍節度使，同中書門下平章事，卒贈太師中書令，隴西郡王，當時咸稱爲李國舅。</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Blocks Japanese Advance; Fierce Battle Unfolds Outside Changsha; Chinese Interception of Japanese Rear and Flanks Proves Quite Successful; Japanese Plainclothes Units Infiltrating China Are All Eliminated</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman announced at 10:00 AM today that the Chinese army is still holding Changsha tonight and is facing a fierce attack by the Japanese 6th Division. A bloody battle is underway outside Changsha. The spokesman also said that at 7:00 PM this afternoon, he had spoken with military officials in Changsha, confirming that the Chinese army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army, which is attacking with bloodshed. It is reported that the Japanese forces participating in the war are the 3rd, 6th, 13th, 14th, 40th, and 44th Divisions. The spokesman added that the Japanese army launched a terrible human sacrifice in the afternoon but still failed to make any progress. The war is currently taking place three to five miles from the city. It is said that the Japanese Fifth Column (plainclothes soldiers) has been discovered in Changsha, but it is not certain whether the Japanese have used paratroopers. At the same time, it is reported that Chinese bomber squadrons successfully attacked the Japanese army in the afternoon. The entire Chinese army in the north is conducting flanking attacks, which are said to be very successful. As a result, Japanese reinforcements have not been able to leave Yuezhou and Hankou. Meanwhile, Chongqing is very concerned about the fate of Changsha. This is the third time since the war began that Changsha has been seriously threatened. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) Changsha, 8:00 PM on the 28th, reports that on the evening of the 27th, several hundred Japanese plainclothes soldiers infiltrated the Chinese front line and launched a sneak attack on the northeastern suburbs of Changsha. They were all eliminated by the Chinese army this morning, and order in the city is as usual. (2) Changsha, 8:00 PM on the 28th, reports that as of the time of the dispatch, the Chinese front line is still in the area north of the Lao Dao River, Shizipu, and Huanghua City, resisting strongly, and the Japanese army has made no progress. Apart from some Japanese bombing of Chinese positions today, the situation is relatively calm. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing</p>
<p>Military News: (1) The battle on the entire Xiangbei front has continued fiercely on the original battlefield from the evening of the 27th to noon on the 28th. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft bombing, repeated fierce attacks were all blocked by the Chinese army's strenuous defense, preventing the Japanese from advancing. Subsequently, several small groups were organized, attempting to take advantage of the opportunity to bypass the Chinese flanks, but were all ambushed and killed. The entire front is still a bloody and fierce battle. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Fierce fighting continues on the Xiangbei front. Chinese sources say that they are currently strongly resisting the Japanese advance to the south. The main force of the Chinese army's column is putting pressure on the Japanese flanks and rear. The Chinese army has recovered several military transportation centers in the Japanese rear, including several important ferry crossings at Miwei and Xinqiang River, and the important Tingziqiao station on the Yuehan Road north of Yuezhou. Judging from the current situation, the Chinese seem to be paying great attention to activities in the Japanese rear and flanks, hoping to use this attack to stop the Japanese advance. According to Chinese military experts, Changsha lacks natural defenses, and the Chinese air force, heavy artillery, and mechanized equipment are relatively inferior. Therefore, in addition to putting pressure on the Japanese rear and flanks to cut off their supplies and reinforcements, there is no way to stop the Japanese frontal attack. At present, the Chinese do not attach much importance to the Japanese offensive from Guangzhou, believing that its purpose is only to divert Chinese attention. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - General Xue Yue, the Chinese commander defending Changsha, recently telegraphed from the Changsha military. The Chinese high command here denies that the Japanese have occupied Changsha. This phone call from General Xue was made at 10:30 AM today. However, General Xue admitted that the situation is very tight because the Japanese army is only five kilometers from Changsha. Xue declared that Chinese soldiers have decided to defend Changsha street by street and alley by alley. An official military spokesman declined to comment on the situation, but repeatedly stated that the Chinese army is determined to continue to fight the Japanese army with all its strength. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: On the tenth day of the Battle of Changsha, the Chinese army stepped up surprise attacks on Japanese strongholds in the rear, recovering strongholds such as Wugou, Changle Street, and Xinshi on the Miluo River, and attacking Japanese warships south of the Miluo River. This Chinese army crossed the north bank of the Miluo River and defeated several Japanese regiments in Gaoqiao, causing "mountains of casualties" and creating a huge overall advantage after the great victory in Taierzhuang in May 1938. At the same time, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in the central section of the Hunan-Hubei border, attempting to relieve the pressure on Changsha. The Chinese military authorities admitted that the situation in Changsha is difficult, saying that the Japanese offensive is more fierce than before, and said that the Japanese claim that they broke through Changsha on Saturday afternoon and that the Chinese army suffered more than 10,000 casualties is absurd. It also stated that the Chinese army won a victory in Jinjing, 45 miles northeast of Changsha, with extremely heavy casualties on both sides. The military spokesman also strongly proved the absurdity of the claim that Changsha had fallen. According to what he told reporters, he spoke to the Changsha command by phone three hours after the Japanese announced that they had entered Changsha, which shows that the claim that Changsha had fallen is absurd. (United Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese army on both sides of the Miluo River has launched a counterattack, recovering Changle Street, Wukou, and Xinshi, cutting off Japanese transportation and expanding the results of the battle. The main force of the Japanese army is still blocked on the line of Shizipu, Baishui, and Fulinpu, suffering heavy casualties. Last night, a group of Japanese troops reached the northeastern suburbs of Changsha and were surrounded by the Chinese army. The retreat of this group of Japanese troops has now been cut off by the Chinese army, and they are only relying on aircraft to drop supplies. Their combat effectiveness is not strong. Taro Toyoshima, the commander of the Japanese 3rd Division, committed suicide after being wounded in Changle Street. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) The Battle of Xiangbei, from the evening of the 26th to the evening of the 27th, the frontal bloody battle has not stopped. The Japanese troops who launched fierce attacks southward from Liqiao, Fulinpu, and Gaoqiao were all strongly blocked by the Chinese army in the area north of Shedao River and Shizipu, and near Chunhua Mountain. The Japanese troops in Shizipu suffered heavy casualties and their momentum has been thwarted. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce counterattack and is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fighting in the area near Chunhua Mountain is also extremely fierce. The Chinese army behind the Japanese army has occupied important river crossing points along the Miluo River, such as Wukou, Changle Street, and Xinshi. The troops on the south bank of the Miluo River have reached areas such as Shawan Datangpu, and near the Sandeqiao Baishui Station. All Chinese troops along the Xinqiang River have also made expected progress. (2) On the Xiangbei front, on the 26th, the entire line was engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat all day. The Japanese troops concentrated their full strength and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army, but were suppressed by the Chinese army's crisscrossing firepower and failed to succeed. In the battlefields around Sandeqiao, Liqiao, Fulinpu, and Gaoqiao, the Japanese army suffered many casualties, the soil was red, and the fierce fighting continued without end. (3) On the 26th, a part of the Japanese army advanced into the southwestern area of Gaoqiao and was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. By evening, the Japanese army had been completely wiped out. (4) The Chinese army on the Hunan-Hubei border operated behind the Japanese army and achieved great results. On the evening of the 24th, it recovered Tingziqiao, cutting off the main supply line of the Japanese army and annihilating many Japanese troops. It is now actively expanding the results of the battle. (Dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Chinese Army in Pengze Achieves Success in Attack</p>
<p>The Chinese army in Leping and Pengze launched attacks on the Japanese army in Malukou, Efengjian, Xibianshan, Kulianshu, and Huangtuling on the evening of the 23rd. The Japanese army in Efengjian and Xibianshan suffered heavy casualties after being attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Kulianshu was driven out by the Chinese army in one fell swoop, and a lot of supplies were captured. The Chinese army in Huangtuling also occupied it once and set fire to the Japanese warehouse, causing significant losses to them. The Japanese reinforcements in Malukou launched a counterattack on the Chinese, and the fierce fighting was very intense. As of the morning of the 24th, they were still in a stalemate in the nearby area. (Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The various Chinese units attacking the Japanese outer strongholds in Pengze continued to capture Xiaohongshan, Xibianshan, and other places from the evening of the 24th to the dawn of the 26th, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. The Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements to counterattack southwest, but were all repelled by the Chinese. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to advance forward, continuing to make progress. (2) The Chinese troops attacking near Nanchang captured Zhuqian City on the evening of the 23rd, and then captured Shanghuangxi, Duzhoufang, Jiangcun, and other strongholds by the 26th. The Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements to counterattack, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from advancing, but were all repelled by the Chinese. They are still progressing smoothly as expected. (Dispatch from the 28th)</p>

They are currently still confronting the Chinese in the Fengmen'ao, Shizishan, and Dieshushan areas. Another group attempted to harass Xinhu Road, but were stopped by the Chinese army on the Jinggen line and had to retreat slightly. (Dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Spy on Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chongqing issued an air raid alarm at 1:10 PM today, lasting for one hour and fifty minutes.

<p>London - The British Colonial Office said that according to a report from Dr. Kendall of the Hong Kong Health Bureau, a ship carrying lepers from Hong Kong to the Chinese interior was attacked by Japanese patrol ships with machine guns en route, but no one was injured. Japanese officers then boarded the British ship escorting the ship and shot a British officer in the head with a rifle, but he was not seriously injured. The Japanese officers ordered the British crew to board Japanese boats, and inspected the other ships. Upon learning that they were carrying lepers, they apologized and left. Before long the waves began to churn, and the ship temporarily stopped. Unexpectedly, people boarded the ship again to inspect it. However, those who boarded the ship were pirates. Seeing that they were foreigners and held certificates issued by the Chinese military authorities, they did not disturb them and left. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-examination of Japan's Alliance with the Three Powers</h3>
<p>The signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan reached its first anniversary the day before yesterday. I remember the situation at this time last year, Germany and Italy were complacent, and Japan was full of arrogance, as if victory was just around the corner, and the desire to divide the world could be realized immediately. Especially Japan, which had long felt isolated in diplomacy, suddenly gained two allied countries. In their elation, even Konoe and Matsuoka expressed that they would prepare to "show" the military power of the three allied countries when necessary, and Nakano Seigo and other active elements even more clamored to divide up territories. However, with only a year's difference, the situation has changed. The exchange of telegrams between Berlin and Rome was just a lonely self-entertainment. Although Tokyo has issued slogans that have not been heard for a long time, such as strengthening the Axis powers, it cannot completely conceal the disappointment in their mood. It can be seen that those who are accustomed to tearing up treaties cannot obtain real benefits from the means of concluding treaties. The Three-Power Alliance is indeed fortunate enough to be the continuation of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. As for the actual value of the alliance, there are already many significant facts in this year that can prove it.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, in the past eighty years, its external operations have undeniably achieved great gains. However, it has been eager for quick success and quick profits, with a narrow and shallow vision, and often blinded by emotions and prejudices. In a smooth environment, it can still cope with it easily. Once the international situation is unfavorable, it inevitably makes mistakes. The Washington Conference after the last European war was the first time that Japan suffered international pressure after the Restoration. Thanks to the fact that it was the golden age of constitutionalism at that time, and the authorities were able to maintain a prudent attitude, they were able to live in peace for nearly ten years. After the "September 18th" Incident, Japan was hijacked by extremists internally, and indulged by one or two major powers externally. At the same time, there were totalitarian countries advocating changing the current situation and overthrowing the Treaty of Versailles. Japan's great desires broke out and could no longer be restrained, and its foreign policy embarked on a path of speculation and adventure, starting with the signing of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact in the winter of 1936. At that time, Japanese public opinion generally believed that it was not advisable to form alliances with unreliable countries far away, provoke the anger of powerful neighbors (referring to the Soviet Union), and make the democratic powers look at them with disdain. Therefore, the German demand for a military alliance based on the Anti-Comintern Pact was repeatedly delayed, and no result was achieved even after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the collapse of the Hiranuma Cabinet. If it had not been for the Nazi victory last summer and the crisis in Britain, perhaps the Three-Power Alliance would still be difficult to produce. Japan gladly formed an alliance at the moment when the Nazis were in high demand, although it was one step behind Italy, which participated in the war when the German-French war was about to be settled, but they both had speculative qualities and were focused on how to get a share of the pie after Germany's victory. On the German side, as a Western reporter pointed out at that time: A company never wants to easily accept new shares when it is booming and making profits. The reason why the Nazis at that time eagerly sought to unite with Japan was nothing but to see their own difficulties early and the need to rely on Japanese power. Therefore, the Three-Power Alliance itself was from the beginning a nature of mutual deception and utilization. The actual value of the alliance must be re-evaluated at any time due to the evolution of the international situation. It is not entirely unexpected that it cannot be trusted and effective.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, there was the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact this spring, and recently there was the launch of negotiations with the United States. No matter how the Japanese authorities explain it, this is always contrary to the fundamental spirit of the Three-Power Alliance. In fact, even at the same time as the alliance was established, the Japanese authorities stated that they would not abandon the adjustment of relations with the United States because of this. The other day, Ito, the director of the Japanese government's Information Bureau, gave a speech, extravagantly talking about Japan's contributions after the signing of the alliance, and cited Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and the advance into southern Vietnam as examples. In fact, those were only to satisfy Japan's own desires, and had nothing to do with the Three-Power Alliance, and were definitely not the inner demands of Germany when the alliance was formed. As for the German admiration for the Japanese Navy, hoping that Japan could exert its practical effect of containing Britain and the United States, Japan can only put it in the second place at most to consider. Only how to solve its own difficulties is the urgent task today. Try to see that recently, the US-Japan talks have been endless, but the statements and speeches issued by the Japanese government and its spokespersons commemorating the anniversary of the alliance still avoid directly stimulating Britain and the United States? Therefore, if the Japanese really had great expectations for the signing of the alliance at this time last year, this expectation has been diluted with the passage of time, regardless of what its allies think about this.</p>
<p>However, Japan's indifference to the Three-Power Alliance is one thing, and it will still use this to value itself and use it as a tool to deal with the democratic countries is another thing, which cannot be confused. It's just that no matter how the Japanese government and the public repeatedly clarify that the Three-Power Alliance is the focus of foreign policy, the real focus is on how to achieve its goals and solve the current difficulties. The alliance is just a means, and it is not the only means. If satisfactory concessions can be obtained from the democratic countries, then what was once revered as sacred may not be discarded like worn shoes. However, since such concessions cannot be obtained, the call to support the Axis powers will revive after being silent. When the Japanese side is currently making every effort to show a conciliatory attitude towards the United States, the remaining appeasement policy in the international community was once happy, thinking that it may not be difficult to prevent Japan from leaving the Axis powers. But when Tokyo made it clear that it would not change the Three-Power Alliance as the basis of its policy, these people were worried again, feeling that US-Japan relations could not be improved. In fact, the overall situation in the Far East and Japan's policy have never changed. What has changed are just the illusions in the minds of those who pursue the appeasement policy. What can fundamentally eliminate an alliance is not negotiation or the concession of exchanged conditions, but the decisive victory of the war in the three major battlefields of China, the Soviet Union, and the Atlantic Ocean, and the firm and powerful action of the anti-aggression united front in the Pacific. To this day, the Three-Power Alliance itself has actually become the end of its rope, and there is no need to overemphasize it.</p>
<h3>British Government Re-examines Far East and Near East Policies; Ensuring Transportation Lines Is an Urgent Task; Aid to China and the Soviet Union Are Equally Important</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - The British policy in the Near East, Middle East, and Far East is currently under review by the government. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent claimed that the transportation of supplies to the British army, the Soviet Union, and China occupies an important position in the current cabinet research. The primary responsibility of General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British army in India, is to ensure the transportation lines to the Soviet Union through Iran and the entrances of these transportation lines in Iraq and elsewhere. The War Cabinet attaches great importance to the responsibility we bear to deliver supplies to their destination. If the current transportation lines through Iran to the Soviet Union are insufficient, then what about the lifelines to China? American experts are currently assisting to maintain the smooth flow of the Burma Road, but the maximum freight capacity of the road is 40,000 tons per month, while the previous Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was 75,000 tons. A large number of goods are currently piled up in Yangon waiting to be transported, and methods must be found to transport them out to accommodate the new goods that continue to arrive. Several plans to build new transportation lines between China, Burma, and India have been accepted in principle by the British government. These new transportation lines include railways to supplement the Burma Road, roads starting from India, and air transportation lines.</p>
<h3>British and American Experts Sent to China to Seek Closer Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 28th - The US Treasury Department said yesterday that Kirkland, a foreign service officer under the department, will leave for Hong Kong on Sunday. According to reliable sources, he will participate in an economic conference related to stabilizing China's legal tender. Kirkland will leave San Francisco by Clipper today. It is said that Sir Niemeyer, the governor of the Bank of England, will participate in the meeting. (According to London's announcement yesterday, Sir Niemeyer's mission to Chongqing is of a financial nature). The Treasury Department also said that Kirkland will cooperate with other Chinese, British, and American officials to deal with "financial and economic issues related to the equalization fund, as well as discussions on China's foreign exchange controls and US freezing orders."</p>
<p>Havas, Chongqing, 28th - The Central Daily News commented on the British dispatch of a financial and economic delegation to China, saying that Britain is now fighting for the same cause as China and has entered the same fate. The opening of the Burma Road and all kinds of facts are enough to prove that Britain recognizes the above two points. Now, it has sent a financial and economic delegation to China, led by Sir Niemeyer, the chairman of the Bank of England, and assisted by financial and economic experts from the United States and Britain. This delegation will not only help to strengthen China's financial and economic strength, but also enable close cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States in finance and economy. It will also be of great benefit to the cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States in finance and economy when the world peace line is established after the war. Any step to increase China's strength in the struggle is to increase the strength of the democratic camp and the countries that are currently resisting aggression. Britain is an important part of these countries, so increasing China's strength in the struggle is tantamount to increasing Britain's own strength in the war. This is the same meaning as the Chinese people's hope that the strength of Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries will be enhanced. We are very happy about the coming of the delegation and the selection of the delegation. We will definitely provide all kinds of conveniences and see its success.</p>

<h3>Northern Front of the Three Routes: North, South, and Central; German Offensive Repulsed; South of Lake Ilmen; Black Shirts Aid Nazis in Combat</h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 28th: Soviet Foreign Determiner, Rossofsky, stated yesterday that intense fighting had occurred in Crimea for a full day and night. However, he stated, "The battle of Crimea is taking place outside of Crimea," implying a denial of German claims that Nazi forces had advanced to the Perekop Isthmus and the Sea of Azov.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 28th: The Red Army High Command announced yesterday that four German columns, at a point 220 miles southwest of Moscow, had launched a three-pronged offensive against the Soviet capital, but were repulsed. The Nazi army suffered 20,000 dead and wounded. Soviet public reports stated that the German offensive on the Crimean front was aimed at Sevastopol in the south and the Caucasus in the east, but the offensive was blocked by Soviet fortifications, mines, and air power.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: A Reuters dispatch from Moscow reported that German forces, with their elite troops aided by Black Shirts, launched a fierce offensive against the Soviet lines south of Lake Ilmen near Staraya Russa, but were ultimately repulsed by the Soviet forces stationed there. Fighting in that area had been quiet for several weeks, but recently resumed, especially intensely in the past few days, but the German army did not succeed. Although they briefly occupied the important town of "L," they were soon driven out by Soviet troops. In two days of fighting, the German side suffered 1,500 casualties. A large battalion of the 30th Division and two companies of the Black Shirts were completely routed. According to recent news, there have been no special changes on the Leningrad front. Soviet troops have achieved local victories in several locations, but the important characteristic is the large number of German war materials lost and the successive deaths of German soldiers. A regiment of Hamburg soldiers and the 20th Infantry Division were defeated in this engagement, and many war materials were captured by Soviet troops.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th: On the Northwestern front, the Red Army, led by Klivenko, achieved brilliant results in the past three days, annihilating the 1st Battalion of the 6th Infantry Regiment of the SS Division, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment, and several companies. A total of 1,500 German officers and soldiers were annihilated, four tanks and several anti-tank guns were destroyed. Red Army spoils included four anti-tank guns, three trucks, and a radio station.</p>
<p>Kyiv Red Army Loses One Million; Soviet Union Denounces German False Propaganda</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 28th: The Soviet High Command today issued a public announcement ridiculing German claims that in the unprecedented battle east of Kyiv, four Soviet armies totaling one million men were annihilated, and that this "victory" was a prelude to the Axis's victory on the Eastern Front. The announcement stated that Marshal Budyonny had rescued most of his troops from east of Kyiv. It is claimed that 800,000 Soviet troops under Marshal Budyonny's command are defending the fortresses of the Transcaucasus oil fields. In mentioning the situation in Odessa and Leningrad, the announcement stated that a large number of Nazi troops besieging the two cities were killed by Soviet defenders. The Soviet Union also absolutely denied that Soviet troops had entered the Crimean Peninsula, stating that "no German troops can set foot on Crimean soil."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th: According to German military sources, the results of the unprecedented battle east of Kyiv were announced today. The number of prisoners captured has reached 665,000, more than double the number captured in the battles of Minsk and Bialystok, and 200,000 more than the number captured in Alsace-Lorraine on June 22 last year. If the number of dead and wounded is added, the Soviet army's losses are more than one million. In addition, 884 tanks and 3,718 artillery pieces were lost. The Soviet Union has now lost its most important military production center. The Soviet victory in the Kyiv area is an important turning point in the war against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Treating the Caucasus as a Lifeline; Britain and the Soviet Union Will Adopt Joint Defense Plan</p>
<p>United Press, London, 28th: Authoritative circles here stated yesterday that General MacFarlane, leader of the British military mission to the Soviet Union, reported from the Soviet capital that the first rains have begun on the Southern Front. This is the first official news of rainfall between the Dnieper and Don rivers. General MacFarlane also stated, "German forces continue to attack Crimea." Authoritative circles do not believe that British troops, including tanks, have been sent to the Caucasus. They refused to discuss possible future battles, only stating that no expeditionary force has been sent. The formation of a joint British-Soviet front in the Caucasus to defend the oil fields is considered one of the most important strategic developments in the future.</p>
<h3>Anti-German Sentiment Rises; Martial Law Declared in Czech Territory; Governors of Bohemia and Moravia Replaced; Attempted Assassination of Puppet Prime Minister Fails</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: According to German news agency reports, former Foreign Minister and current Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Neurath, has requested to be relieved of his duties due to physical weakness in order to recuperate. Hitler granted his request and instructed Party leader Heydrich to temporarily take his place. Factories in these two provinces that manufacture German military supplies have recently experienced frequent work slowdowns, and Czech people often sabotage railways and other infrastructure. Neurath, wishing to avoid continued conflict between Germans and Czechs, found the situation quite difficult.</p>
<p>International News Service, New York, 28th: The Columbia Broadcasting Company here learned from British broadcasts that Heydrich, after taking office as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately declared a state of emergency. According to reports, Heydrich has the power to impose the death penalty on anyone who disrupts public order. A British news reporter, commenting on this news, said that Heydrich's appointment to this position is tantamount to admitting that Czech resistance has caused great concern in Berlin.</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 28th: According to Czech sources here, Czech puppet Prime Minister Dr. Hácha was the target of a failed assassination attempt. The assassin, a Slovak officer, has been arrested.</p>
<h3>Rumors of German Pressure on Bulgaria to Declare War on the Soviet Union; Bulgarian King Meets with Hitler to Discuss Important Issues</h3>
<p>Havas, Budapest, 27th: Local newspapers today carried a dispatch from their correspondent in Ankara stating that King Boris of Bulgaria has departed for the Führer's headquarters to meet with Führer Hitler to discuss various important issues. It is believed that the relationship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union will be discussed. Turkish political figures believe that diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will be severed within days, and it is possible that Bulgaria will directly declare war on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 28th: Yesterday, reliable diplomatic sources here stated that Germany has demanded that Bulgaria send 100,000 troops to serve on the Soviet front. The German side stated that these troops would not participate in actual combat, but Bulgaria should formally declare war on the Soviet Union. These sources stated that Germany demanded a swift response, while Bulgaria requested room for negotiation on the point of declaring war. Diplomatic circles, in explaining the previous news that Germany had directly sought a separate peace with the Soviet Union, stated that Germany was attempting to probe the Soviet Union, but not actually proposing conditions for mediation. However, diplomatic circles believe that Germany is willing to guarantee that it will remain on the current front lines and will not advance further, including Ukraine and the Caucasus, until the end of the war. At the same time, Germany guarantees not to invade any part of the remaining Soviet territory.</p>

<h3>The Fate of the Entire War Situation Depends on the Eastern Front; Britain and the United States Guarantee Aid to the Soviet Union; The Three-Power Conference Will Be Held Soon in Moscow; Maisky Thanks Britain for Tank Aid to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 28th: The Three-Power Conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held soon in Moscow. According to news from the Moscow Broadcasting Station, Stalin convened a meeting in the Kremlin today with Interior People's Commissar Beria, Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Molotov, and Defense People's Commissar General Timoshenko to discuss the general situation in order to put forward concrete plans at the Three-Power Conference.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 28th: The Moscow radio station reported yesterday that the United States revealed at the Three-Power Conference that the democratic countries have agreed to fully promise the Soviet Union's request for supplies and equipment to continue fighting against Germany. This request includes aircraft, tanks, and various raw materials. The radio station stated that as a result of this agreement, Britain and the United States will jointly transport hundreds of aircraft, hundreds of tanks, and other equipment to the Soviet Union starting immediately. The radio station stated that the democratic countries have stockpiled tens of thousands of tons of raw materials to supply the Soviet war machine. Although the democratic countries themselves lack raw materials, they will still transport valuable items such as aluminum to the Soviet Union. The United States will also transport several types of steel used for military equipment to the Soviet Union. The radio station stated that the democratic countries have assured Moscow that they will supply the Soviet Union with many other items, such as rubber, tungsten, cotton yarn, wool, ramie, and resin.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: Soviet Ambassador Maisky broadcast here last night to thank the workers for their efforts in the Tank Aid to the Soviet Union Week and expressed the Soviet Union's need for more tanks, saying that the Soviet Union is fighting an unprecedented major battle on the front lines. What will be the result after three months? The entire war situation depends on it. In response to the question of whether the Red Army needs British tanks, he may answer it in simple words: The Soviet Union has indeed developed its tank industry, which was sufficient to meet its own needs when the war had not yet broken out. This can be seen from the quality of the Soviet mechanized units confronting the enemy. But after three months of continuous battles, the situation has changed greatly. On a thousand-mile-long front line, a large number of tanks have been destroyed. Although the Soviet losses are relatively small, they are also significant. How can the usual monthly production compensate for this maximum loss? Moreover, due to Stalin's scorched earth policy, many important military factories have been bombed and destroyed to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Although most of them have been moved to safe areas, it is not possible to choose another factory site and resume work in a short time. Therefore, the production of Soviet tanks has decreased compared to peacetime. The only way to make up for this defect is to ask other freedom-loving countries, especially Britain and the United States, to cooperate. This is why the British and American governments are transferring British tanks to the Soviet army, and why British factories are doing their best to rush to build tanks for the Soviet Union. This kind of method is simple common sense. We must face the facts. Britain and the Soviet Union are now fighting against a very strong enemy country. In this situation, close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is the first priority. We must think of this war with a common front, and both sides' resources must be transferred to each other according to the progress and needs of the war situation. All available aid should be transferred to the Eastern Front at present, because a major war unprecedented in human history has been going on in the Eastern Front for more than three months, and the entire war situation will depend on the fate of the Eastern Front. The more tanks Britain can supply to the Soviet Union, the more beneficial it will be to the entire war situation. He hopes that the production standards achieved this week can be maintained and further improved. The slogan today must be "Manufacture tanks, manufacture more tanks, manufacture even more tanks."</p>
<h3>Guo Renyuan Gives Speech in Britain; Post-War Reconstruction in China; Requires British and American Assistance</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: Dr. Guo Renyuan said in a speech to the British Association today on "Post-War Reconstruction in China" that China is destined to become an important country in world politics and may be a great stabilizing factor for international peace or a major threat. It will all depend on how it is reconstructed after the war. China should get full cooperation from Britain and the United States to establish a well-planned economic system, modernize its industry and agriculture to improve the living standards of the people and overseas trade. Britain and the United States should agree to provide full financial and material assistance to China's reconstruction. The new China needs Britain and the United States to fundamentally change their spiritual outlook on China and the Far East. This morning, the British Association's conference on science and post-war relief was chaired by Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to Britain. Gu said in his speech that if the world continues to be dominated by aggressive forces and barbarism, not only will science stop developing, but civilization will also decline and perish due to lack of fertilizer.</p>

<h3>China Will Expose the League of Nations; Poisoning Policy</h3>
<p>In the Mengjiang region, opium is grown on a large scale. Taking the five counties of Suiyuan, namely, Sui, Sa, Bao, Tuo, and Qing, as an example, opium is planted on hundreds of thousands of acres, and all are good harvests.

<h3>Key Points of Chen Lifu's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At the invitation of this year's annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Minister of Education Chen Lifu broadcast to Britain at 4 a.m. today, titled "Science and Post-War World Reconstruction." The general idea is that the contribution of science to human civilization is something to be proud of, but it is also a fact that it is misused by a few people for improper purposes to hinder collective security. The misuse of science and its inconsistency with the pace of life have produced all kinds of terrible results, such as: (1) A large number of weapons, which have the danger of destroying mankind; (2) In economics, the creation of a global institution, which is contrary to nationalism; (3) Changes in the population growth rate of the upper and lower classes of society; (4) The constant emergence of novel products, making it difficult for people with slow changes to cope; (5) Creating a serious social problem of unemployment and stimulating the desires of ambitious aggressors, leading to a world war. However, science itself is not guilty, and its rapid progress is not blameworthy. What we should do today is to redefine the goals of science, so that science can be put to proper use, and that the progress of human ethical concepts can keep pace with it, so that mankind can enjoy the benefits of scientific progress without suffering its harm. In his conclusion, Chen proposed convening a world education conference to jointly discuss the perfect principles and methods of integrating science and ethics. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Oil Refinery; Will Start Work Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since the War of Resistance and National Construction, the power fuel used has mostly relied on foreign countries. Because the source is not easy and the price is high, experts such as Xu Boyun have devoted several years of research and experimentation to manufacture gasoline and kerosene from plant raw materials. After experimentation by the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, its quality can be compared with imported products. A Chinese oil refinery was established in the capital by raising funds, and Mr. Xu was hired as the director. The steel pipe equipment has been completed and will soon be produced in large quantities to meet the needs of all parties. It is said that in addition to manufacturing gasoline and kerosene, the factory also has plans to manufacture glycerol, oil, diesel oil, paraffin oil, and asphalt oil. (27th dispatch)</p>

<h3>North China Oil Importers; Unwilling to Import Oil</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Representatives of oil importers attended a meeting convened by the Japanese in Beijing last Tuesday to discuss the status of the oil industry in northern China. Oil merchants stated that the future is not guaranteed, and that existing oil and funds in the mainland have now been frozen, so they are unwilling to consider importing oil. It is heard that the Japanese intend to assist oil merchants in activating their mainland assets. If this can be done, then Asia and Mobil will jointly import a small amount of oil. It is currently found that Asia alone has gasoline that can supply three-quarters of a month's normal needs, while the American oil companies have sold out their inventories. Therefore, it is now necessary to adopt a oil certificate system as done in Shanghai. These negotiations have attracted the attention of pig bristle exporters, because it is believed that an understanding can facilitate the recovery of pig bristle exports. It is found that there are many pig bristles stored for export, but they cannot be transported out at present. (28th dispatch)</p>

The rules for setting up circulation stations will be submitted to Yang Xizhang for review.</p>
<h3>Dr. Shen Youqian's Lecture: "Training of Thought"</h3>
<p>Explanation of the Importance of Adapting to Circumstances in Thinking.  The city's Academic Lecture series held its eleventh lecture yesterday, inviting Dr. Shen Youqian, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, to speak on the topic of "Training of Thought."  Dr. Shen has a wealth of insights into educational psychology, and many people who admired him came to listen, filling the seats.  The following is an excerpt of the speech taken by a reporter from the Da Hua News Agency, summarizing the main points:</p>
<p>1. Thought versus Thinking:  Ordinarily, we all know that turning an idea is "thought," but we don't use "thinking." However, the meaning of what is commonly called thought is very vague and refers to different things, including recollection, association, hope, speculation, etc. Therefore, it is better to use "thinking," which is clearer. Thinking is not just random thinking; it must be creative, that is, it must have new discoveries. In one's own opinion, it is newly created and must be consistent with the facts. When thinking, you must use methods of thought, but you must have a purpose, as well as be reflective or critical.</p>
<p>2. The Place of Thinking in Life: George Bernard Shaw said, "Humans use not only thought, but also thinking." If humans cannot think, they cannot adapt to such a complex environment. Because the simplest method for animals is to use "instinct," instinct is a kind of inherited adaptability, rigid and unchanging. It is ridiculous to use instinct alone, while thinking must adapt to circumstances. What is more advanced than instinct is "habit." Habit is a behavior that adapts to a situation. Animals can also be trained to develop habits. Once a habit has been formed, it is difficult to change. Often, as soon as a habit is formed, the situation has changed, so it is also very rigid and not applicable enough. There is also "imitation," which is also an old method. If everyone uses imitation, then human culture cannot progress. Only knowing how to follow others cannot create new things. So, although it is new to the individual, it is still old to the whole, and there is imitation of errors and impropriety, which feels ridiculous. There is also "trial and error." If a problem cannot be solved and there is nothing to imitate, then various methods are tried randomly, or fortunately a suitable one is found, but most of them fail. Sometimes a single trial is unsuccessful, and the second attempt cannot be continued. This is very blind, uneconomical, and even dangerous. Therefore, to achieve a solution economically, the only thing to rely on is thinking. Thinking is planned and creative, different from instinct, habit, and imitation, and also has a degree of difference from "trial and error." Therefore, everything humans do must use thinking. When thinking, there is first a plan in imagination, and then it is done. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>President of the Ruilong Sports Association Plans to Launch a Chinese Football League, Hoping for Sympathy and Cooperation from All Parties, and First Soliciting Registration from Various Teams</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese football team has decided to withdraw from the Shanghai Westerners' Football Association, it cannot stop playing football because of this setback. However, the environment on this isolated island is complex, and developing a career is very difficult. In football, the field is the basic requirement. In this city, land is as expensive as gold, and it is even more difficult to find land of fifteen acres or more that is large enough to meet the standard of a football field. However, Zhen Dan University, the Donghua Association's ball field (i.e., the French Army parade ground), and Jiaozhou Park, etc., may not be impossible to use. However, it is difficult to gather things together due to a lack of leadership. Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association in this city, in view of this, plans to raise his arms and call for action, taking responsibility for reporting the beginning of the chicken. However, because many hands make light work, and gathering feathers makes a robe, it is hoped that all sectors will give sincere cooperation. A preparatory office has been temporarily set up at the Ruilong Sports Association, No. 5, Lane 271 (Zhaofu Lane), Sanma Road, and the following points are raised to solicit replies, so that basic conditions can be established and active progress can be made. The details are as follows: (1) All teams in this city that are willing to participate in the Chinese League should first indicate their team names and specify the groups (provisionally planned to set up two groups, A and B). It is best to attach a list of players, with at least fourteen and at most eighteen players per team. If you have your own field, or rent a field that can be used for competitions, please state it clearly. (2) If there is open space of about fifteen acres that can be leased or sold, please specify the conditions and contact address, and the name of the person in charge, so that personnel can be sent to contact them. The location is limited to the area within the two concessions, preferably in the Public Concession. (3) If the league can proceed smoothly in the future, the world's latest complex management system will be adopted, that is, each participating team can only send a representative to manage the league, and the Executive Committee will be the highest authority to handle all affairs. The Executive Committee will be elected by ballot, so it will be absolutely open to the outside world. However, with regard to preparatory expenses and self-owned ball fields (if possible), it is planned to adopt the nature of a joint-stock company and issue shares. On this point, please contribute opinions from all sectors to seek collective wisdom and benefit. Mr. Wang said yesterday that his initiation of this competition is entirely for the sake of sports. For half a month, he has only seen calls and waves of support, but no one has come forward to lead, which shows that there are many who are afraid to do it. However, I am absolutely neutral and do not consider fame or profit, so if this move can become a reality, I also plan to add the name of a temporary organization, and will never be subject to the jurisdiction of any party, but will be organized by the public on its own. All parties hope to give sympathy and love.</p>
<h3>Grass Tennis Finals Not Held Yesterday</h3>

<p>Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association, has raised his arms and called for the organization of a Chinese football league, which we give unlimited sympathy and support to. However, the ball field problem is the most difficult. We hope that all people in the city who are enthusiastic about promoting sports will work together. If there is open space that can be used as a ball field, willing to lend or rent it, to promote this move, please immediately inform the "Sports New Column" of this newspaper, or the Ruilong Sports Association. Furthermore, yesterday, the Mainland News reported that as a result of the Chinese football team withdrawing from the Westerners' Football Association, the loss of the Westerners' Football Association's ticket sales for this season will be more than 200,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yiyou Cup Table Tennis Competition: Preparing for the Championship Final</h3>
<p>Ticket Revenue to be Used for Blind Relief Fund</p>
<p>The Table Tennis Division of the Yiyou Society, No. 13 Fushui Lane, Tianjin Road, which is hosting the Yiyou Cup Individual Table Tennis Championship, began competing on the 18th of last month. After a month of round-robin battles, the winners and losers have already been determined. The various prizes for the winners, after the efforts of Cheng Dan, Ao Chengshu, Ming Kong Hanchen and other club members to solicit them, are dazzling. Those who fail to gather the right to the championship will be awarded a commemorative bronze medal by the authorities. The club, in accepting the proposal of Cheng Dan and the two gentlemen, plans to take advantage of the final opportunity to invite Shanghai's top table tennis players and male and female table tennis masters to participate in the performance. Tickets are divided into two types, one yuan and two yuan, and the ticket revenue will be used for blind relief expenses. The club believes that this move is of great significance, and has also obtained the approval of Zhu Lianxiang and Zhu Wenwei, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Sports Committee. A preliminary discussion was held a few days ago.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Stabilization Fund and the Shanghai Black Market</h3>
<p>— Translated by Meng Jiamo</p>
<p>From the perspective of the official circles in Chongqing, all foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai whose exchange rate is lower than the pre-war exchange rate are black market transactions. The true legal exchange rate of Chinese currency is still maintained at one shilling and two and a half pence per pound sterling, and three US dollars; this legal exchange rate was set at the time of the Chinese currency reform in 1935, which is more than four times higher than the current Shanghai exchange rate for pound sterling, and almost six times higher for US dollars. However, in the Free China area, Chinese government banks also set a "commercial exchange rate" for importers and exporters that is lower than the pre-war exchange rate. For example, in Chongqing and Kunming, the government has even lower exchange rates for purchasing foreign exchange. For years, the Chinese government has also used the Sino-British Stabilization Fund and its government banks to maintain an exchange rate in Shanghai that is much lower than the legal exchange rate. Now, this new managed currency stabilization fund has come to try its best to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market, setting a new official price of 5.3125 US cents per yuan of national currency.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai black market currently being discussed, in the minds of bankers and the general public, does not immediately refer to the foreign exchange transactions mentioned in the previous section that are lower than the pre-war exchange rate. Strictly legally speaking, this type of transaction is indeed a black market. Now, what we call the Shanghai black market refers to foreign exchange transactions carried out after the freezing of Japanese funds by the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India, other than those carried out by the fourteen foreign banks licensed to operate foreign exchange, or Chinese banks cooperating with the Central Bank. The exchange rate of this type of transaction is significantly lower than that set by the Stabilization Fund, by about one-tenth. The existence of this black market will threaten the entire commerce of Shanghai in the future. But will this black market continue to exist? Will it permanently occupy an important position in Shanghai commerce? Will importers, exporters, and the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India still be allowed to use this black market for trade, in addition to settling foreign exchange at the official price with licensed banks or the Stabilization Fund?</p>
<p>How did the Shanghai black market come into being? First of all, it is because there is a large circulation of US dollars in Shanghai. These US dollars can be shipped to the United States at a relatively low cost, and they can be freely deposited into bank accounts, with very free purchase and sale, and even forward transactions. Therefore, the price of each US dollar is about two to two and a half yuan higher than the official price of the Stabilization Fund. However, pound sterling banknotes are conversely lower than the official price of 76 yuan per pound sterling set by the Stabilization Fund by 25 yuan, or 33 percent. The reason is that pound sterling banknotes cannot freely flow into the pound sterling group area, and local British banks and companies, etc., also refuse to accept them except in special circumstances. Therefore, pound sterling banknotes are not as valuable as US dollars in the black market.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the supply of black market foreign exchange, there are also many drafts issued by British and American banks before the implementation of the freezing order on July 26. Many of these drafts can still be paid by the paying banks in the United States. However, because many of these funds have ultimately become frozen assets, their value is slightly lower than that of US dollars, which are cash in themselves. In addition, there are many promissory notes and remittances sent to Shanghai from the United States before the freezing order. Most of the people who hold these types of foreign exchange drafts do not exchange them at banks cooperating with the Stabilization Fund, but turn to selling them on the black market, because they are greedy for higher exchange rates.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a large number of export drafts supplied in the black market. There are many exporters in Shanghai: some who are nationals of all-powerful countries, some who operate trade with their own funds, or some who do not rely on the Stabilization Fund and do not interact with licensed banks, sell their export drafts on the black market, and the national currency they receive is 10 to 15 percent higher than selling them to the Stabilization Fund. In recent weeks, the source of black market foreign exchange transactions has mostly been the supply of these export drafts.</p>
<p>As for the buyers of black market foreign exchange: first and foremost, they are importers who cannot apply to the Stabilization Fund for settlement, or merchants who cannot obtain a sufficient supply of foreign exchange; especially for those importers whose goods have arrived in Shanghai and urgently need to pay the full amount of the goods before they can be picked up, or whose shipments have already been shipped from abroad and are on their way to Shanghai, they do not need to worry too much about the foreign exchange purchased on the black market not being useful because the authorities in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India have prohibited the export of cargo. Other buyers of black market foreign exchange include: foreigners selling real estate, collectors who are tired of storing foreign currency, and very few speculators, many of whom still believe that freezing funds in the United States is the safest investment.</p>
<p>Currently, the Stabilization Fund is certainly fighting the black market. If foreign exchange can be obtained from the Stabilization Fund, all banks have unanimously withdrawn from the black market; if it is discovered that importers who have applied to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange are trading on the black market again, the Stabilization Fund will no longer provide a supply. Banks operating foreign exchange must be upright and honest, and guarantee that foreign exchange obtained from the Stabilization Fund will not flow into the black market. On this point, the Stabilization Fund is also working hard to cut off the main source of the black market. It insists that merchants who have obtained the right to apply to the Stabilization Fund should sell their export drafts to licensed banks at the official price, and those in the banks operating export trade should be forced to settle their export drafts at the official price.</p>
<p>In addition, the circulation of currencies from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India in Shanghai should be stopped, and new drafts issued by several banks of the three nationalities should not be allowed to be traded in the black market. If this plan can be implemented, it would be very effective in stopping the source of black market foreign exchange. The Stabilization Fund can also use other measures to crack down on black market transactions; the Stabilization Fund authorities are asking the governments of Washington, London, and Batavia for cooperation in issuing uniform licenses for shipments from Shanghai, which clearly stipulate that foreign exchange proceeds from these shipments must be sold to designated banks at the official price of the Stabilization Fund before they are allowed to be imported. The Stabilization Fund can also negotiate with the US authorities to prohibit the free circulation of US dollars from a certain date, following the British example, and prohibit US commercial banks outside the US border from accepting these US dollars.</p>
<p>The observation of the Shanghai black market seems very bleak. The ABCD democratic countries have the right to restrict trade with Shanghai, which must be carried out through the fourteen licensed banks in accordance with the official price of the Stabilization Fund, and trade between the remaining democratic countries and Shanghai can be completely isolated unless there is smuggling. The value of US dollars in Shanghai can be sanctioned by the US government, causing it to depreciate below the official price of the Stabilization Fund. Drafts issued before the freeze can also be controlled. If these various plans can be implemented in parallel, the source of black market foreign exchange can be cut off, and Shanghai merchants will no longer be confused. If they do not cooperate with the Stabilization Fund, they can only immediately stop their trade with the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and India.

<h3>Shanghai Gold Market and Shanghai-Hong Kong Exchange Rate as New Targets for Speculation</h3>
<p>— By Hua Sheng</p>
<p>Becoming Ownerless Wandering Souls</p>
<p>After the Stabilization Fund, with the cooperation of the British and American governments, effectively concentrated the supply and demand of foreign exchange in this city and stabilized the supply exchange rate, the Shanghai gold market, which relied on the rise and fall of the US dollar exchange rate, also lost its target. Because the exchange rate is stable, the gold price converted from the exchange rate is also fixed, and speculative behavior cannot be carried out. The Shanghai gold speculative market, where daily transactions used to be tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, has become extremely depressed, with daily transactions of less than one hundred. The bleakness can be imagined.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in the gold market and the ups and downs of the exchange rate were originally the two major demons threatening general prices. In recent years, prices have been rising, and the livelihoods of ordinary people have become unspeakably difficult. Although there are many reasons, it is also due to the speculative gold market and foreign exchange speculators. Now the Stabilization Fund is using a method of killing two birds with one stone to eliminate them at the same time, which is more meritorious than building a seven-story pagoda. However, gold and exchange rate speculators are still unwilling to give up and are trying to salvage the situation, hoping to reopen the black exchange market through the activities of the Banque Franco-Italienne. However, since the sources of British and American foreign exchange have been fundamentally blocked, and the Banque Franco-Italienne has no real strength, their struggle is just a waste of effort. Even gold bugs know that their general trend has passed. Therefore, they have fantastic ideas and decided on the 20th of this month to use the Hong Kong exchange rate to settle future gold market futures starting in October. However, will this settlement method be sustainable? It is still a question. Let us first describe the gold market and exchange rate market in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Gold Market</p>
<p>The Hong Kong gold market is located at No. 14 Massa Street, Sheung Wan; in English, it is called the Chinese Money &amp; Gold Exchange, and its main business is the buying and selling of raw gold and silver, and gold and silver currencies of various countries. There are 246 members, and there are two sessions every day, morning and evening, with two plates in each session. The first plate of the morning session (i.e., the opening price) is at 12:15 p.m., the second plate is at 12:30 p.m., the first plate of the evening session is at 5:55 p.m., and the second plate is at 5:30 p.m. There is no market on Saturdays and Sundays. The main trading items for gold are: (1) gold bars, (2) one-two gold, (3) eight-nine gold, and (4) four-four gold. The settlement price is based on London pure gold and the pound exchange rate. Since the United Kingdom fixed the gold price at eight pounds and eight shillings, and also fixed the Hong Kong dollar at fifteen pence per dollar, the Hong Kong gold market has also been controlled invisibly.</p>
<p>It is necessary to briefly explain the four main trading items mentioned above. In the past, gold speculation in the Hong Kong market was divided into three parts, namely British gold, US gold, and raw gold. British gold is divided into gold blocks and two-one gold. The former is made of London pure gold, which is carried out according to HSBC listings and Reuters telegrams, and is either settled in London or in Hong Kong. This type of transaction has been impossible since the European War. Two-one gold is a British gold coin with a face value of one pound, weighing two mace, one fen, and three li in Chinese weight, hence the name two-one gold. After the First European War, this coin has stopped circulating. This type of transaction in Hong Kong is only for speculation and hoarding. Because of the shortage of spot goods, there is also no transaction to speak of.</p>
<p>US gold has gold blocks, eight-nine gold, and four-four gold. Gold blocks are New York pure gold, and the trading method is the same as operating London pure gold. After the United States controlled the gold market, this type of transaction also no longer exists. Eight-nine gold and four-four gold are both US gold coins. Eight-nine gold, also known as Citibank Big Gold, is a coin with a face value of US$20, weighing eight mace, nine fen, and three li and three hao in Chinese weight. Four-four gold, also known as Citibank Gold, is a coin with a face value of US$10, weighing four mace, four fen, and six li and six hao in Chinese weight, abbreviated as four-four gold. Both are converted according to the US pure gold price and the Hong Kong-US exchange rate. After British gold transactions could not be carried out, Hong Kong speculators focused on eight-nine gold speculation, which seemed to be the center of Hong Kong gold market transactions. Later, due to insufficient chips, after September 1931, four-four gold was used instead.</p>
<p>Gold bars are produced by gold shops; like jewelry gold in silver shops, they are both Hong Kong's local gold transactions. The asking price unit for gold bars is calculated per ounce, and the asking price unit for jewelry gold is calculated per Chinese tael. The price originally followed the transfer of eight-nine gold and today's four-four gold. After the Hong Kong government managed it, it stipulated that the net import price was HK$140 per ounce, and it has remained fixed ever since.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai gold market has lost its speculative target and become an ownerless wandering soul. The price of Hong Kong gold bars remains unchanged. It is originally not suitable as a speculative basis; the reason why gold bugs choose Hong Kong gold as the settlement standard is that the drunkard's intention is not in the wine, but in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market. In recent years, due to frequent Hong Kong-Shanghai trade relations, the Hong Kong government's control over the Shanghai exchange rate has become tighter and looser, and the policy is uncertain; therefore, the exchange rate has changed frequently and fluctuated greatly, thus becoming the darling of Shanghai gold bugs.</p>
<p>Since 1926, Hong Kong's Shanghai exchange transactions have been concentrated at the Hong Kong North-South Bank (i.e., Bonham West Street), the storefront of Juedelong Bank at No. 36. The trading time is from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. every morning. There are currently more than one hundred members. The market price is calculated as the number of legal currencies per HK$100. Currently, the Shanghai exchange market price is around 460 yuan of legal currency per HK$100, while at this time last year, it was only 412 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ultimately a Waste of Effort</h3>
<p>Now the Shanghai gold speculative market stipulates that Hong Kong gold bars and the Shanghai exchange rate will be used as the settlement standard, which will be implemented from next month. The method has been published in the commercial news of this newspaper on the 20th, and the main points are:</p>
<p>(1) The official price of Hong Kong pure gold (i.e., gold bars) is HK$140 per ounce, and each ounce is 0.9953 taels in market weight; that is, 9.953 market taels, which is equal to HK$1,400.</p>
<p>(2) Each Shanghai gold speculative bar is ten market taels, with a purity of 992/1000; the pure gold of each Shanghai gold speculative bar is equal to 9.92 market taels. Converted according to the Hong Kong gold price, each Shanghai gold speculative bar is equal to HK$139,540. This is a fixed number. Dividing this fixed number by the Shanghai exchange rate will be the standard for the Shanghai gold speculative market's month-end settlement price. The formula is:</p>
<p>The current variability of the Shanghai exchange rate is due to two reasons: (1) The ratio of legal currency to Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong is lower than the ratio of legal currency to Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai. Therefore, speculators in Hong Kong are engaging in large-scale arbitrage, that is, selling legal currency from Hong Kong in Shanghai, buying Hong Kong dollars in the Shanghai market and returning to Hong Kong; exchanging them for legal currency and then shipping them to Shanghai again, and exchanging them for Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai and returning to Hong Kong. Such arbitrage takes the difference, so the Hong Kong exchange rate and the Shanghai Hong Kong dollar exchange rate are both highly variable. If the above-mentioned arbitrage involves transporting cash, it is all smuggling, because Hong Kong has long restricted the export of legal currency. (2) Although Hong Kong's exchange control laws also apply to Shanghai, in order to maintain Hong Kong-Shanghai trade, China's government's request is allowed, so it is more lenient. Therefore, speculators can also operate from it, so the Shanghai exchange rate in Hong Kong fluctuates.</p>
<p>The reasons why Shanghai speculators are now changing to Hong Kong gold and the Shanghai exchange rate as the settlement standard are, in addition to salvaging the speculative situation, also have political implications. Because the Hong Kong government can cooperate with the Chinese government at any time to tighten its control over the Shanghai exchange rate. Once controlled, it will inevitably promote the shrinkage of the Shanghai exchange rate; which is not what Chinese merchants want to hear. Now Shanghai gold speculative prices are settled based on Hong Kong gold and the Shanghai exchange rate. (1) Because the National Government and the Hong Kong government have no intention of tightening control over the Shanghai exchange rate, the market price is highly variable, and Shanghai speculators can therefore prolong their lives. (2) If the Hong Kong government and the National Government tighten control, it will directly promote the shrinkage of the Shanghai exchange rate, indirectly suppress the value of the legal currency, and at the same time make the free zone of China unable to fully utilize the Hong Kong-Shanghai trade relationship to obtain the supply of Shanghai materials. It can be said that it is a far-sighted move and a move that kills two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>However, there are also two reasons why the Hong Kong government and the National Government are relatively laissez-faire about the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate today: that is, (1) the Stabilization Fund's management of the Shanghai exchange market has been successful, at least for the time being; therefore, the flow of legal currency from Hong Kong to Shanghai, although not a good idea for China, has not given people the convenience of arbitraging foreign exchange. (2) If the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market is relatively free, then Hong Kong-Shanghai trade can be active; this is naturally beneficial to the material needs of the free zone.</p>
<p>However, since Jiangning announced the prohibition of the export of materials at a discount, and the Japanese army tightened its blockade of free Chinese ports, although Hong Kong is outside, the situation has also changed. The National Government and the Hong Kong government have lost the significance of maintaining Hong Kong-Shanghai trade; therefore, they have also lost the significance of maintaining the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate at the same time. In addition, the speculation in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market will become more and more widespread due to the relationship between the gold speculative settlement price. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee that the Stabilization Fund will not cooperate with the Hong Kong government to apply the current method of controlling the US and British exchange rates to the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange market. Therefore, is it possible for this settlement method to last for a long time? It is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Ration Cards</h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Since leaving Shanghai, the abnormal prosperity has offset the war in the minds of those who make a fortune from national calamities: Although they encounter closed doors everywhere and see starving masses trampled by high prices collapsing on the roadside, cars are driving so fast that this impression does not last long in their minds.</p>
<p>As prices soar, ordinary people groan under the pressure, while the automobile class continues to enjoy the blessings of money. What's to fear with money? Shanghai is indeed an isolated island, but as long as ships arrive, there's no fear of not being able to buy anything with money. The number of ships will not stop, even if the British and American merchant ships decrease, there are still Japanese merchant ships!</p>
<p>Alas! They truly haven't realized: In this era of war, the omnipotence of money will ultimately be tested by real materials. Even if you have ships, even if you have inexhaustible money, without real things, it's all useless.</p>
<p>Now ships still arrive as usual, and money is still worshiped, but the purchase of gasoline is subject to restrictions. To get gasoline, you must first obtain a ration card; some people even think this is the result of restricting foreign exchange, but in reality, it is not the case at all. Mainly, it's the lifeblood of this event. Even if producing countries have inexhaustible resources, they must strive to save exports and reserve them for essential needs. Moreover, Britain, the United States, and others are banning oil daily. If the import of gasoline to Shanghai is allowed to continue, the oil ban would be meaningless. These two reasons are the main reasons for restricting gasoline and implementing ration cards this time. Will the people who have generally forgotten the war now regain their impression of the war?</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers, US and India Cotton Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market continued to show weakness. Prices fell due to foreign merchants selling off. Subsequently, both spot and futures prices fell by 3 to 7 points compared to the previous day. The price of Middling spot cotton was 17.18 cents per pound, equivalent to $358.58 per picul.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market had no telegraphic report yesterday. It is reported that the unofficial prices have fallen slightly by seven rupees. The price of Oomra was 238 rupees, equivalent to $176.24 per picul. The price of Oomra was equivalent to $128.14 per picul, and the price of Pingguoer was equivalent to $103.22 per picul.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous, Cigarette Leaf Drafts Can Be Settled, Cigarette Market is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was stable, although the manufacturers still had no goods to distribute, it was known that the drafts for cigarette leaves could be settled, so people's hearts were quite stable. Scattered retail sales seemed slightly active, causing the market to hover. The price of the Great Britain brand was $2,200 per case, the Old Knife brand was $1,840, the Pin Hai brand was $1,400, the Wu Hua brand was $1,170, the Fairy brand was $1,340, the Beauty brand was $1,150, and the Golden Mouse brand was $760.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market has been hovering for a long time and there have been no major changes. Because the general inside and outside hoarders have been stagnant for a long time, the actual sales also feel weakened. The market opened slightly bullish yesterday because the atmosphere of favorable news for the situation was thick, and the people in the industry were tense. The market price of fixed soap was $59.50 per case, Bai Xiangmao was $50, Huang Xiangmao was $47, Arrow Knife soap was $53, Beauty brand matches were $1,070, Phoenix brand was $1,015, and Sailboat brand candles were $36.50.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Summer Discounted Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Also Hoarded —</p>
<p>Summer woolen fabrics that have been discounted for a long time have recently been targeted by hoarders. Both large and small quantities have been heavily stockpiled. White serge, white straight tribute, fat leather, and Van Ertong, etc., are being piled up even more frantically, causing their prices to suddenly skyrocket. Those who hold the goods are particularly afraid that there will be no goods on the market next year, and most are unwilling to sell in whole batches.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials, Galangal Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Galangal is becoming scarce due to the lack of supply, and the market inventory is gradually running out, so the price has risen sharply by 20 to 30 yuan. The recent market price for large galangal is 100 yuan, Shen Zhuang is 90 yuan, and small galangal is 80 yuan. The trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Gardenia Goods on the Way</h3>
<p>Gardenia was previously scarce in origin, and the numbered goods had already sold out, so the market was extremely firm. According to a letter from the numbered firm, a batch of goods has been shipped and is on the way. The cost is higher than before and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Coal, Boshan Bituminous Coal Weak</h3>
<p>Boshan bituminous coal has been very weak in the market recently due to factory shutdowns and hoarding by hoarders. Both the unofficial market and the official market have fallen across the board, dropping by 10 yuan. Currently, Boshan bituminous coal, the same industry warehouse order, is 445 yuan per ton. The lower-grade chips have entered the 400 yuan level, and are also traded within 393 to 4 yuan. The warehouse station trucks are subject to additional levies.</p>

<h3>Duff Cooper Prepares to Visit Shanghai, British Community Has Prepared to Welcome Him, Marshall and Others Form a Five-Person Committee, British Intelligence Agency Has Not Yet Received Notification, US-Japan Relations Side Refuses to Disclose Opinions on Duff Cooper's Visit to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, it is confirmed that Duff Cooper, the British government's special envoy to the Far East, is indeed preparing to visit Shanghai with his advisor Casey, former British military attaché to the Japanese embassy Major General Pigott, and other military personnel after inspecting the situation in various parts of the Far East. The purpose of this trip is to inspect the actual situation in this city and hold discussions with local officials. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, is currently in Singapore meeting with Cooper, but it is not yet known whether Kerr will travel to Shanghai with Cooper. It is reported that the British officialdom and community in this city have formed a five-person committee to prepare to welcome Cooper. The members are Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Heimann, general manager of HSBC, RG Woodhead, secretary of the Shanghai Power Company, British Consul General George, and Philip, director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In addition to sending a telegram of welcome, they are also making arrangements in advance.</p>
<p>British Community Hopes Are Extremely Eager</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reported that Casey, manager of Jardine Matheson and former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now serving as Duff Cooper's special advisor and will accompany him to Shanghai. The reporter inquired about this information from Alexander, the British intelligence commissioner in this city. He said that he had not yet received official notification and therefore could not comment. However, the British community in this city is very eager for Cooper to visit Shanghai. It is said that Shanghai still occupies an important position in the international situation, so they hope that Cooper and his wife Diana will visit Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chinese Side Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>The Chinese side in Shanghai believes that the activities and mission of Duff Cooper's visit to Shanghai will be an important factor in the UK's decision on its future Far East policy. Cooper's visit is fundamentally to strengthen the UK's war organization in the Far East. On the other hand, understanding the actual situation in China is also one of the main purposes of this trip. The British ambassador to China, Kerr, went to Singapore to meet with Cooper, which is proof of this. Moreover, at a time when US-Japan talks have not completely stopped, the activities of the British special envoy to the Far East will inevitably be given considerable importance by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Concession Issue Will Inevitably Be Discussed</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, if Cooper's visit to Shanghai is true, then the issue of the Shanghai concessions will become one of the focal points of discussion between Cooper and relevant Shanghai officials. Mr. Casey, the current advisor to Cooper and former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will definitely explain to Cooper the truth about the Shanghai International Settlement that he has encountered during his one-year term as chairman. Well-informed people have repeatedly urged the British and American countries to support the status quo of Shanghai with a strong posture, and not to allow the administrative sovereignty of the concessions to be fragmented. For this reason, after Cooper's visit to Shanghai, there will be important decisions on the attitude that the British side should take on the concession issue. At the same time, Cooper will maintain important contacts with American officials in Shanghai through the issue of the Shanghai concessions, so that the cooperation between the UK and the US in Shanghai will be stronger.</p>
<p>US and Japan Refuse to Disclose Opinions</p>
<p>Regarding Casey's visit to Shanghai, relevant parties dare not express a definite opinion. When Casey left Shanghai in May of this year, he said that he would return to Shanghai only after the end of the war. At that time, Casey's stated reason for leaving Shanghai was to return to the UK to visit his family. After arriving in the US, he stayed in various places in Washington and New York to discuss with the US shipping authorities on adjusting ship transportation in the Pacific. Later, after Cooper arrived in the US from the UK, Casey was hired as an advisor and followed Cooper to the Far East. If Cooper is indeed going to visit Shanghai, it is very likely that Casey will come along. As for the views of the Japanese and American sides in Shanghai on Cooper's visit, the relevant parties believe that the time is not yet ripe and refuse to disclose them.</p>
<h3>Thirty-One Commercial Banks, Deposits Double Loans, Hinterland Fixed Deposit Interest Rate Increased to Two Points, Port Deposit Interest Reduced to Maximum of Eight Li</h3>
<p>After the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Farmers Bank of China, were ordered to encourage the internal transfer of port funds, they specially formulated unified domestic remittance methods, and determined remittance methods for the hinterland with reference to market conditions. Anyone who remits Shanghai general remittance bills to the hinterland can receive cash in full in any part of the rear, and strive to increase the deposit interest rate in the hinterland. As for the commercial banks, in view of the ever-changing international situation, various businesses strive to be prudent in order to accumulate sufficient reserves, and cooperate with the four national banks to implement the established policy of assisting the government in guiding floating capital, so that excess floating capital can be transferred to the interior.</p>
<p>Total Deposits Exceed 100 Million</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sheng News Agency inquired from the bank yesterday that the total deposits of 31 commercial banks including Zhejiang Xing and Shanghai Zhejiang as of the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China were 100,024,998,112 yuan. Including current commercial deposits of 64,100,000,523 yuan, fixed commercial deposits of 17,277,691,911 yuan, savings deposits of 75,900,048,812 yuan, trust deposits of 329,645 yuan, interbank deposits of 58,833,7046 yuan, special deposits of 2,354,050 yuan, and other deposits of 10,425,512,121 yuan.</p>
<p>Loan Amount Only Exceeds 50 Million</p>
<p>The loan amount of each commercial bank is 50,121,964,641 yuan, including 16,923,436,367 yuan for current loans, 10,259,899,960 yuan for fixed loans, 36,401 yuan for discounts, 314,575 yuan for mortgages, and 12,903,533,336 yuan for other loans. According to the above-mentioned commercial banks, the deposit exceeds the loan amount by one time, which proves that there are few investment avenues in Shanghai, and at the same time, for the sake of prudence, loans to Shanghai are particularly prudent in order to consolidate the foundation of the bank itself.</p>
<p>Guiding Floating Capital in Shanghai to the Interior</p>
<p>After the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Farmers Bank of China, as well as the Central Trust Bureau and the Postal Remittance Bureau, were ordered to increase interest rates in the hinterland, the fixed deposit interest rate was uniformly increased to 1 to 2 points, depending on the length of the term. The current interest rate on current deposits is 5 to 8 li, and various preferential interest increase methods have been formulated. As for the interest rates of commercial banks in the corresponding areas, they have successively revised and increased them. However, the deposit interest rates in Shanghai and other ports have been reduced separately. The maximum fixed deposit interest rate is 8 li, and the current deposit interest rate ranges from 1 to 3 li, and various preferential interest increase methods have been cancelled. It is stipulated that when the deposit exceeds a certain amount, the excess part will not be calculated as interest. Commercial banks in Shanghai handle the collection of inland deposits with preferential interest rates, and the purpose is also to guide the floating capital in Shanghai to the interior.</p>
<h3>Changsha Telegram, Due to War Outside the City, Commercial Telegrams are Sometimes Suspended</h3>
<p>According to news from yesterday, a unit of Japanese troops entered Changsha city and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese army. After inquiring from various parties, this is not confirmed. The most prominent example is that the American news agency still received and sent wireless telegrams from Changsha to Shanghai yesterday. Commercial telegrams from Shanghai to Changsha were also received and sent as usual, and it was said that the time was fast, only taking half a day to reach the destination. Although the agency has stopped receiving and sending commercial telegrams from Shanghai to Changsha, this is because there is war in the area around Changsha. It is difficult to deliver commercial telegrams. However, telegraphic transfers from post offices and banks can still be communicated as usual. As for the Great Northern Telegraph Company, business parties can still send telegrams as usual, and the Great Eastern Telegraph Company only stopped commercial telegrams, which shows that the situation in Changsha yesterday did not change.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Photography and Plate Making Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Wage increase of 12 yuan. The photography and plate making industry workers in this city started a strike on the 16th of this month. The two parties negotiated the afternoon before yesterday. With repeated concessions, a satisfactory solution was reached. All workers resumed work yesterday. The method is that the plate-making workers and carpenters will all receive a wage increase of 12 yuan. Apprentices will receive a wage increase of 3 yuan within three years, and 5 yuan within five years. The catering will be provided by the employer, and those who take care of themselves will receive an additional catering fee of 60 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce's Hong Kong Office Requests Continued Refugee Relief Donations</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various important industries in this city regarding donations for refugee relief, stating that the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been doing its best to carry out refugee relief work since its establishment, relying on the enthusiastic support and generous donations from various industries to achieve this righteous act. According to the association, in addition to sending refugees away in succession, there are still more than 10,000 refugees being accommodated. When it was established in the 17th year, the living expenses per person per month only needed about 2 yuan. Now, due to high prices, each person needs about 16 yuan per month, an increase of eight times compared to before. They also need to be dispersed separately, which requires a large amount of money. In the past, various industries stipulated two types of donations: business commissions and salary commissions. The donation period is about to expire, and it is proposed to send separate letters to discuss whether to continue to be responsible. The situation of more than 10,000 refugees still needs to be continued after the refugees have been relocated. Now that prices are rising day by day and a large amount of money is needed, all donations recognized by various industries are still requested to be handled in accordance with the original plan, so that the relief work will not be interrupted, and more than 10,000 disaster victims will be grateful.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Rationing System Implemented, Strict Limits on Usage, Consumption Can Be Reduced by Two-Fifths, Oil is also Reduced Simultaneously</h3>
<p>According to investigations, there are 12,000 private cars in the city (7,000 in the International Settlement and 9,000 in the French Concession), 4,000 trucks, and 800 motorized bicycles (500 in the International Settlement and 300 in the French Concession). From today onwards, it will be impossible to obtain gasoline without obtaining a "gasoline distribution card." The measures taken by each company are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase Oil with a Certificate</p>
<p>(1) From today onwards, purchase oil with a certificate. All gas stations will stop supplying other customers. (2) Each gas station will supply gasoline according to the quantity specified on the "gasoline distribution card," and shall not exceed it. The maximum limit for each payment shall not exceed 10 gallons. (3) Currently, due to the lack of oil tankers, each company has no other good policy except to take follow-up measures in order to try to extend the supply time of existing gasoline as much as possible. If the situation can be gradually improved in the future, a notice will be issued to cancel this restriction.</p>
<p>Strict Measures</p>
<p>(4) The allocation of oil is based on the direct environment. The quantity allocated at present may be subject to further reduction. If this is the case, all circumstances and the percentage of reduction will be announced in the daily newspaper. A new gasoline distribution card will be issued on November 1, at which time the old card must be returned and exchanged for a new card. (5) The issued gasoline distribution card is not allowed to be mortgaged or transferred. Gas stations only sell gasoline to vehicles with the license plate number noted on the gasoline distribution card. (6) When the vehicle has stopped being used, please return the gasoline distribution card. If the license plate number is changed or the address is moved, please notify us immediately by letter for record. (7) When purchasing gasoline, you must hand over the gasoline distribution card to the manager of the gas station so that he can use pliers to squeeze out the amount of oil purchased on the card for identification. (8) The purchase of gasoline must be in cash. (9) Gasoline companies do not have any obligations for issuing this new card, and do not guarantee the total amount of oil supplied by the new card.</p>
<p>Future Consumption</p>
<p>According to reports, although the owner of an average medium-sized car applies for 30 or 40 gallons of gasoline per month, the company authorities only approve 23 gallons, which is less than 1 gallon per day. Therefore, if the number of rides per day is slightly higher, there will be a feeling of insufficient gasoline. It is also learned that, starting from today, major oil companies will also send personnel to each gas station to check the daily station oil inventory and consumption quantity. According to a large estimate by a certain gasoline merchant, after the implementation of the gasoline distribution card, the daily sales quantity of major companies is about 6,000 gallons. Before the gasoline was restricted, the daily amount was about 30,000 gallons. After the implementation of this quota distribution system, the gasoline sold is only three-fifths of the original amount. In addition, the oil used by British public buses will also be reduced by 20% starting from today.</p>
<h3>Yuezhou Ship Fire Damages Goods, Handling General Average</h3>
<p>The Taikoo company's Yuezhou ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the morning of the 27th and docked at Pier No. 3 of the company's Bund in the French Concession. When the longshoremen were busy unloading the cargo around 4 pm, a fire suddenly broke out in the head compartment. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that in addition to the miscellaneous goods loaded in the head compartment of the ship being destroyed by fire, the rest were soaked by the water used to extinguish the fire. The Peking carpets transported from Tianjin must be transferred to the UK, so they are the most valuable, and some of them are also damaged. The company is preparing for general average for the damaged goods on the ship. The ship was ordered to sail to the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong around 4 pm yesterday to remove the damaged goods, so that the average can be accounted for by the notary public. Freight customers can register with the company today to handle the general average formalities.</p>
<h3>Save on Mid-Autumn Festival Extravagance and Engage in Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>And Promote Winter Clothing Movement</p>
<p>The Municipal Festival Saving Movement Committee previously issued a notice, calling on people from all walks of life to actively promote the winter clothing movement, and the Shangjiao Moral Charity Association requested all walks of life to save on Mid-Autumn Festival extravagance, relieve hidden poverty and street refugees, and carry out porridge and rice distribution work. As the weather is getting colder, there is an urgent need for cotton clothes to keep out the cold. Refugees in Shanghai are crying for food and shivering in the cold, and the situation is tragic. Therefore, we especially ask people from all walks of life to act on their conscience and enthusiastically donate to fulfill their national duties.</p>
<h3>Bank Warehouse Business Rules Revised by the Banking Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Warehouse Business Rules were announced and implemented by the Banking Industry Association on October 1st of the tenth year of the Republic of China. After the government adopted the legal currency policy, many of the provisions were inconsistent. In March of the 26th year, it was submitted to the Warehouse Subcommittee for re-revision. In May of the same year, it was reviewed and approved by the Practical Research Association, and then reviewed and implemented by the Association. By the winter of the 27th year, due to war relations, business conditions changed a lot, and if a part of the rules was not revised, it would not be able to meet the needs of the facts. Therefore, discussions began in the 28th year and were completed in the autumn of the 30th year. During the meeting, opinions were widely sought from all parties, and repeated studies were conducted without being too detailed. The summary of the revision案 is as follows (the full text has a total of five chapters and 53 articles):</p>
<p>Stipulate the Types of Warehouse Business</p>
<p>Types of warehouse business: (1) Custody of entrusted goods, (2) Rental of warehouse rooms, (3) Ancillary business. No interest will be paid on the security deposit or other funds received by the warehouse in its business operations. Warehouse rent is calculated on a monthly basis. If it is less than one month, it will also be calculated as one month even if it is one day. The depositor should keep the seal for the entrusted goods for verification when picking up the goods or transferring ownership. Otherwise, the warehouse will not be responsible for accidents. The value of the entrusted goods is more than 700 yuan per piece or special attention should be paid to it during storage. The depositor should state it in the application form. The warehouse may refuse to accept the following types of goods, and may cancel the contract even if it has been agreed: (1) Dangerous goods, (2) Contraband, (3) Incompletely packaged goods, (4) Goods that are easy to rot and damage or deteriorate, (5) Goods that the warehouse deems unsuitable for storage or that may damage the warehouse or other goods.</p>
<p>Cancel the Storage Deadline and Evacuate</p>
<p>The warehouse may cancel the storage contract with the depositor or warehouse holder and limit the time for evacuation of the entrusted goods in one of the following circumstances: (1) Discovering that the entrusted goods have dangerous or contraband items, etc., (2) Arrears of warehouse rent and other expenses for more than six months, (3) The warehouse deems that the value of the entrusted goods is insufficient to cover the warehouse rent and its expenses, (4) The warehouse building is completely or partially renovated, (5) The warehouse address is relocated, (6) The warehouse is completely or partially closed. After receiving the notice in the preceding paragraph, the depositor or warehouse warrant holder shall pay the warehouse rent and various expenses in full and evacuate the entrusted goods as soon as possible. If the warehouse is delayed and ignored, the warehouse may move the entrusted goods to another place or auction them to offset the warehouse rent and other expenses from the proceeds. The surplus will be returned and the deficiency will be recovered.</p>
<p>The Warehouse Bears the Responsibility for Compensation</p>
<p>The warehouse is only responsible for compensation for damage to the entrusted goods directly due to the warehouse's intentional or gross negligence. The calculation of the damage compensation is based on the market price of the entrusted goods when they enter the warehouse, or based on the market price at the time of damage. The warehouse has the right to consider the handling. If the depositor has not declared in advance, the amount of damage compensation shall not exceed 700 yuan in national currency per piece. The warehouse shall not be liable for damage to the entrusted goods due to natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, fires, soldiers, thieves, insect injuries, rat bites, humidity, mold, dryness, erosion, strikes, epidemics, and all other irresistible or avoidable circumstances. The warehouse shall also not be liable for damages due to sunlight, rain, wind, sand, frost, snow, and other unavoidable damages for those who are placed outside the fixed warehouse or in the open air. In case of damage, the depositor or warehouse warrant holder shall still be responsible for paying the warehouse rent before the damage is compensated.</p>
<h3>Mail to Soviet Russia and Europe Will Be Sealed and Dispatched in Stages Today</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the Siberian postal line has only been used by the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. At 8 pm today (29th), a batch of mail will be loaded onto a train and transported via this line. Although the mail to Kiev and Leningrad is in a fierce war zone, the Shanghai Post Office still accepts and sends it as usual. Whether it can reach the destination depends on the situation at that time. In the afternoon of the 29th, the Shanghai Postal Administration will have a large batch of mail to Europe and the United States, totaling more than 1,000 bags, loaded onto the American mail ship President Pierce and transported to Europe from Shanghai. It is estimated that the postal journey will arrive in the United States at the end of next month, and will be transported to various parts of Europe in early November.</p>

<h3>Residents of McTyeire Terrace Oppose Subdivided Sale of Apartments: Failure to Curb This Trend Will Impoverish the People</h3>
<p>Due to the oppression by landlords and the threat of "subdivided sales," the residents of McTyeire Terrace on Avenue MacMahon in the French Concession have jointly submitted a letter to various sectors, arguing that in this isolated post-calamity island where the population has surged and finding housing is extremely difficult, real estate speculators are unscrupulously resorting to ingenious maneuvers, making transfer illusions, and forcing evictions to raise rents. This has plunged renters throughout the city into extreme panic, affecting the entire society and harming people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Gasping for Survival</p>
<p>From now on, anyone living in alleyway housing will feel insecure. Moreover, most renters have small leases, and among them, many are small businesses. Relocating their shops is unrealistic and, if their business is affected, it would indirectly threaten their livelihood. One small move affects the entire situation, and the negative consequences are beyond description. Alas, our common people are already gasping for survival amidst unprecedented price struggles, and now this serious housing problem has emerged. What hope is there for a peaceful and prosperous life?</p>
<p>Prejudicial to Public Order</p>
<p>We believe that this speculative activity, which disturbs the majority of citizens and is prejudicial to public peace, must be opposed resolutely. In addition to uniting with oppressed alleyway residents throughout the city to petition the authorities of both Concessions and the judicial administration for impartial relief to seek a thorough solution and realize the protection of Article 420 of the Civil Code, we humbly offer the following points for public discussion based on our limited perspectives.</p>
<p>Speculating for Profit</p>
<p>(1) Selling apartments within a building is a legitimate property transaction, and no one should interfere arbitrarily. However, recently, abuses have been rampant, ultimately resulting in the property being reclaimed for personal use, forcing eviction, intimidation, and deception. Therefore, such real estate transactions are purely speculative and profit-driven and should not be considered legitimate business. All sectors should pay attention to this point and find ways to stop it to prevent future occurrences.</p>
<p>Creating Complications</p>
<p>(2) In the case of houses sold in subdivided manner, there should be attention to the necessary conditions for the subdivided house, such as not having connected roofing or walls, and all public utilities can be separated. If this subdivided house has connected features, then it is possible for the living room, kitchen and everything else to be sold separately, creating many difficulties for all future tenants.</p>
<p>Find a Way to Stop It</p>
<p>(3) The abuses of subdivided sales, as mentioned above, are enough to cause major panic among city residents. Therefore, this matter is not merely a housing dispute, but an entire social problem. We urge the authorities of both Concessions and the judicial administration to find ways to stop it, or ask the competent authorities to establish a "Housing Dispute Committee" to handle this type of dispute, to maintain people's livelihoods and social stability, which is what citizens urgently need and desire.</p>
<p>Consider Public Opinion</p>
<p>(4) We request the Concession courts to give some consideration to public opinion in future cases of this type. This is the most effective and only solution. This is not the people interfering with the judiciary, and historically, court rulings have mostly favored the renters, as the citizens have seen. What needs to be added is that these landlords are very cunning, and they often exploit the renters' minor weaknesses during lawsuits, attacking them individually, making it impossible for the renters to defend themselves. The courts are thus misled. Once they win a lawsuit, they will exploit the law, and this should be deeply guarded against.</p>
<h3>Details of the Kidnapping of Fei Ziyi at the Entrance of Lianzhu Alley, Avenue Edward VII: Abducted After Leaving His Concubine's Residence</h3>
<p>At 0:15, a kidnapping occurred at the entrance of Lianzhu Alley on Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement. Due to the lateness of the hour and the impending curfew, a detailed investigation was not possible at the time. The following are further details of the case:</p>
<p>Wives Separated</p>
<p>Fei Ziyi, a 65-year-old from Wuhan, previously owned the Deyu pawnshop in his hometown, which was destroyed by artillery fire during the war. Fei's family sought refuge in Shanghai, housing his two wives separately. His wife, Mrs. Lu (54 years old), resided at 44 Lianzhu Alley, Avenue Edward VII, while his concubine, Mrs. Wang (37 years old), lived upstairs at Guangrentang in Sanfeng Alley, Chengdu Road. Fei, having some savings, usually had a car (license plate 4862) driven by a local driver, Gu Liugen, and another chartered car (license plate 6429) driven by a Qidong native, Yuan Sheng.</p>
<p>Kidnapped on the Way Home</p>
<p>Fei usually visited his concubine every evening and stayed until late at night. On the evening before last, Fei took his chartered car to the house of his concubine. Because the curfew was approaching, he took the car home. Near the entrance to Lianzhu Alley, three kidnappers suddenly pounced, threatening him with guns, dragging him out, forcing him into a black compact car parked nearby, and speeding off. Afterwards, the driver, Yuan Sheng, reported the incident to Fei's wife, who informed the police to investigate Fei's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Former Qingdao Municipal Government Official Arrested by Japanese: Another Person Arrested on Rue Amiral Bayle</h3>
<p>A certain Zhou, a former official of the Qingdao Municipal Government from Shaoxing, currently residing at 175 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession and currently unemployed, was arrested by the Japanese on the previous evening. Japanese plainclothes officers drove to the French Concession police station in Zikawei, requesting additional Chinese and Western detectives to accompany them to arrest Zhou. He was taken back to the police station, briefly questioned regarding his name, age, and origin, and then handed over to the Japanese and taken to Hongkou.</p>
<p>Also, at 7:30 yesterday morning, Japanese plainclothes officers drove to the French Concession police station, requesting to dispatch personnel to 153 Rue Amiral Bayle to arrest a Chinese man. It is learned that the arrested person is named Long Zhou from Suzhou, who worked at the Minsheng Shiye Company. According to the Japanese, the reason for the arrest is that the equipment used on the Minsheng Shiye Company's ship "Minniu" belonged to the Chinese government. The Japanese have requested the French police to hand over the arrested person for interrogation in Hongkou.</p>

<h3>Details of the Kidnapping of Two Students</h3>
<p>Children of Tao Dingyao, Chinese Comprador of the Asiatic Petroleum Company</p>
<p>On Rue Guynemer in the Western Extra-Settlement Roads area, at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred. Four armed bandits ambushed a black-plated car, kidnapping the two children and the car. Details follow:</p>
<p>Tao's Children</p>
<p>Tao Dingyao, resident of No. 6, Lane 71 of Rue Guynemer, is a Chinese comprador working for the Asiatic Petroleum Company at No. 1, The Bund. He has a son and a daughter, both of whom are studying at a certain school. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Tao's two children were riding in the car with license plate No. 10233 to school. As soon as the car pulled out of the lane, four bandits jumped out, forbidding the children from making noise. They ordered the driver out of the car.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Without a Trace</p>
<p>Tao's children curled up inside the car, too frightened to call for help. The bandits got into the car, with one driving it away towards the west. The driver ran to inform the owner, who urgently reported the incident to the Special Police for investigation. As of today, two days later, there are no clues.</p>

<h3>A Page of Lincoln's Family's History of Hatred</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>An Inevitable Walk</p>
<p>During his life, Lincoln often took a child for a walk, and did so frequently during his 22 years of marriage. Did he love walking? Perhaps; however, the main reason was arguing with his wife. His wife had a very bad temper; servants, water carriers, or delivery people were all subjected to scolding, and in most cases, Lincoln often succumbed. Initially, he would just laugh it off, but laughter could not stop her temper, so in later instances, he used walking as a way to cope; however, when he returned home, the noise would start again.</p>
<p>Lincoln's married life was truly unhappy. His wife came from a wealthy family and was a local social butterfly, with the magic "to make a pastor forget his prayers." She loved dressing up and squandering money, while Lincoln came from a poor family and was a great man who succeeded entirely through his own efforts.</p>
<p>Differences in personality between husband and wife naturally lead to all sorts of friction, so young men and women should carefully study the other person's personality when choosing a partner and must not be careless. At the same time, we can better understand Lincoln's greatness. Although he was in a troubling environment, he was still able to accomplish great feats. Couples who enjoy a happy married life, how should they strive to benefit humanity!</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Lincoln's wife could understand Lincoln's greatness and give him the greatest cooperation, then Lincoln's contributions to humanity would certainly be greater and more astonishing, I think.</p>
<h3>About Our Bodies</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>A person's body has enough electricity to light a 25-watt light bulb for up to three minutes.</p>
<p>From our hair, we can see if there are any blood diseases. If blood circulation is abnormal or a person has anemia, their hair is often dull.</p>
<p>Most speech disorders are created between the ages of three and eight, so children should pay attention when learning to speak.</p>
<p>The feeling of fear is enough to affect blood circulation and tighten the skin, so it is actually possible for hair to stand on end from fear.</p>
<p>Worry and fear are enough to cause tooth decay. Recently, an American lost nine teeth in three weeks because his wife was seriously ill during that time.</p>
<p>When we sleep, our brains contract, and our bodies expand because most of the blood flows to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Because the acidity on our skin is different, some people are more likely to attract mosquitoes and bedbugs, while others are never bitten by them at all.</p>
<p>Our saliva and stomach acid are the most effective germicides in the body.</p>
<h3>Future Fathers Training Center</h3>
<p>— Li Si Hua</p>
<p>The Maternity Center Association of New York, USA, in order to ensure the safety of mothers and babies, has specially organized a future father training center, where a group of men who are about to become fathers receive training. The training courses include a lesson on bathing wax dolls.</p>
<p>The organization of this new undertaking is because no fewer than 10,000 people die annually in the United States from childbirth (said to be the most in the world; Norway has the lowest maternal mortality rate, accounting for 2.6 per thousand). Of the 2.25 million babies born each year in the United States, 75,000 die right after being born.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility of men in the United States has invisibly increased. They cannot just think that they have fulfilled their responsibilities by being able to afford household expenses. They must receive preparation and training for fatherhood after their wives become pregnant.</p>
<p>During the training period, a future father must do the following:</p>
<p>1. Accompany his wife to see a doctor before she is three months pregnant.</p>
<p>2. Accompany his wife for a walk nearby so that she gets plenty of air and exercise.</p>
<p>3. Because pregnant women are easily noticed when they go outside, take his wife to places with fewer people.</p>
<p>4. Prepare all the things needed for the baby.</p>
<p>5. Learn how to bathe a baby.</p>
<p>6. Arrange the hospital or doctor for delivery a few months before delivery.</p>
<p>7. After the birth of the baby, the family life will change from then on, especially when the first baby is born. The father will take on more of the heavy work.</p>
<p>8. Set aside some time each day to play with the baby.</p>
<h3>Housewife's Notes</h3>
<p>Clothes stained with summer stains can be washed with warm water to remove sweat stains.</p>
<p>Hammering nails into the wall often damages the paint on the wall, but if you soak the nail in hot water first and then hammer it in, it won't be a problem.</p>
<p>When the coal stove gets too hot, sprinkle water on the coal to reduce the flames.</p>
<p>To sharpen dull scissors, you can use the scissors to cut a large piece of sandpaper into small pieces. After cutting, the scissors will be sharp again.</p>
<p>After putting the eggs into the bowl, add a little salt to make it easier to beat the eggs.</p>
<p>To make the light bulb emit the greatest light, it is a good method to wipe it with a slightly damp cloth.</p>
<h3>Proper Method of Hanging Frames</h3>
<p>From the frames a person hangs, one can see his personality. A person who loves sports will hang a few photos of sports. A person who loves drama will use frames decorated with drama as the theme.</p>
<p>However, ordinary people use a hook to hang frames, so the line for hanging the frame becomes a triangle (as shown in the figure). In fact, the proper method should be as shown in the picture on the left, because this can match the molding of the house and is much more beautiful.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Qian Ying</p>
<p>Every building in Shanghai has bedbugs,</p>
<p>The total number of citizens is five million,</p>
<p>Each person is sucked of one cc of blood by bedbugs every night,</p>
<p>The total amount of blood sucked by bedbugs every night is equal to a dan of water; if all the bedbugs in the city are caught,</p>
<p>Several trains can be filled.</p>
<h3>Weekly Home Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. This Sunday is the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the homes of the wealthy, they must set up banquets and celebrations on the night of reunion, while in ordinary families, they will inevitably eat better, especially taro stewed with edamame, as if it cannot be considered the Mid-Autumn Festival without taro and edamame. Both of these things are rich in vitamins, and eating them not only fits the festival scene but is also beneficial to the body. The taro does not need to be peeled, but it must be stewed until soft. The edamame does not need to be shelled, but it must be stewed until crispy. When stewing, just add some salt. Those with strong digestion can eat more, while those with stomach problems should eat less. "Taro Stewed Beans" in the Sunday menu is the abbreviation of taro stewed with edamame.</p>

<p>Method: Chop the pork, chop the wood ear and water chestnut and mix with the shrimp. Add salt, sugar, soy sauce, MSG, etc. and mix into the meat. Separately mix the flour with water, salt and egg white to make a batter. Then take the lotus root and cut it into slices (two slices connected), sandwich the meat filling into the lotus root slices, dip them in flour batter, and put them into the oil pot to fry. Once cooked, take them out. When eating, they do not lose the lotus root flavor. If you want to eat vegetarian, you can replace the meat and shrimp with diced shiitake mushrooms and cabbage as the filling, and it will become vegetarian lotus root cakes.</p>

<h3>Reasonable Austerity</h3>
<p>— Pingye</p>
<p>After the power company established restrictions for users, now the gasoline company is issuing gasoline purchase permits for fuel consumption, and is also implementing gradual control. Originally, in this national crisis, it is only right and proper for everyone to restrain their material desires. However, while many users understand this, there are bound to be some who feel inconvenienced. In fact, the phenomenon of wives shopping and young masters going to school, frequently spending foreign exchange to buy gasoline for transportation, is no longer appropriate today. This gasoline control should be a good reminder for those who have failed to be self-restrained in the past.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and of course many people cannot avoid the customs. But in reality? "Gazing at the bright moon together, we should shed tears," "Only grieving for not seeing the reunion of the nine provinces." Who can bear to waste money and indulge in extravagance? Even if one is fortunate enough to profit from business, isn't it all given by the general public's groans and sighs? In that case, receiving from society, it is best to seek welfare for society. At the very least, we should not create a wasteful trend that harms society.</p>
<p>Rather than extravagance, let us choose thrift. I hope the citizens of Shanghai will actively practice frugality, help themselves and others, understand each other, and fulfill their respective responsibilities, without being restricted by customs. We must know that the fraction of financial resources we save today is cultivating our future happiness.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Shutong's Humorous New Couplets</h3>
<p>— Qingjing</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Zhang Shutong, is skilled in calligraphy and painting, tracing back to Dong Yuan and emulating Xuanzai. His paintings, in the style of Confucian scholars, are indeed different from those of painters. Mr. Zhang is elegant and unrestrained, his mind as clear as a bright breeze and a clear moon, untouched by any dust. Therefore, his paintings are also refined and transcend the mundane, greatly different from the murky atmosphere of today. Recently, requests for Mr. Zhang's calligraphy and paintings have been pouring in, so he has closed his doors to guests and dedicated himself to calligraphy and painting for several years now, ignoring everything else. Mr. Zhang also enjoys elegant humor, not bound by cumbersome formalities, resembling figures like Zheng Banqiao and Li Liweng. Now, Mr. Zhang is sixty-five years old. Looking at his playful self-congratulatory couplet and the couplets he wrote for others, we can already see a glimpse of his humor:</p>
<p>Looking up to the sky and laughing, laughing at wasting more than sixty years, a rice bag and a wine bag, actually consuming quite a lot; looking at my shadow and feeling sorry for myself, pitying my dignified seven-foot body, following the current and drifting along, achieving nothing, what to do?</p>
<p>Drawing flowers, writing characters, and reading ancient and modern books, all have their own interest; boiling tea, smoking, and talking witty words are also enough to delight the mood.</p>
<p>Here, we only talk about romance and beauty, not about politics. If you are a passionate person, please refrain from opening your mouth;</p>
<p>Inside the room, there are both flowers and trees, and also qin and books. If you are a refined gentleman, you may as well visit often.</p>
<p>Home is everywhere, sitting is fine, lying down is also fine, there is absolutely no restraint; be patient and calm, since you have come, be at ease, you can chat casually.</p>
<p>No vulgar rhymes, no noisy dust, living alone in leisure, entering my lighthearted thoughts, the autumn moon is white; there are qin, books, flowers, and trees, the windows are bright and the table is clean, welcoming people with refreshing air, the distant mountains are green.</p>
<p>Although this place is narrow and overflowing with dust, fortunately, there are calligraphy, painting, qin, and chess, you can use them to pass the time as you like; on the seat are many learned scholars and great men, if you talk about romance and beauty, it is enough to expand my mind.</p>
<p>You are coming? Very welcome. The universe is vast, a fly is tiny, feel free to discuss casually; are you bored? There are plenty of ways to pass the time, flowers and plants nourish the heart, poetry and books nourish the spirit, you can indulge in dissipation as you like.</p>
<p>The flowing water and high mountains place their interest outside the mundane world; listening to incense, reading paintings, and appreciating the heart are in the ability of the wonderful.</p>
<h3>Glass Cuts Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>— A Reader</p>
<p>This incident has happened more than once in our alley - the feet of rickshaw pullers are cut by broken glass.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this is really wrong. There is clearly a garbage truck in the alley, but some people insist on dumping all sorts of things at the door, and broken glass is naturally thrown out casually. I really don't know if those people, when they see the poor man's bleeding feet and painful groans, will think that they are the culprits.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I came home, I saw a rickshaw parked in front of my house. The rickshaw puller was sitting in front of a house not far away. A kind old lady across the street was helping him take out the broken glass and bandage his feet, but blood was still flowing from the cloth. The rickshaw puller pitifully complained, "The rickshaw is rented from the British Concession, it costs more than three yuan a day. I finally pulled a Russian, only got more than two dimes, but I cut my foot, bad luck!" I came in and told my mother, and my mother told me to give him two dimes. But can two dimes help him? Although others also give him money, he may have a wife and children. The money people give him may not even be enough for the rickshaw rent.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) On the road, these kinds of heartbreaking things are common. There is broken glass, and even more banana peels and melon rinds, etc. Those who discard them do so easily, but those who unfortunately step on them, fall, and suffer serious injuries suffer endlessly. Someone who pushes these kinds of harmful things to the side of the road is doing a public service.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Storms</p>
<p>"Understood, we will send someone to inquire tomorrow." Patrol Chief Li instructed Manager Meng to write down Begonia's name on a piece of white paper, and said it in such a grand manner.</p>
<p>However, before their brothers went to the countryside, Zhao Yukun had already quietly returned that evening and told Begonia everything he had done, and also taught him in detail what he should say when he saw the people in Manager Meng's family, and how he should answer if the police came to inquire. Therefore, he was simply waiting at the Begonia's house.</p>
<p>The next day, at noon, the North River Town Police Branch indeed sent a patrol officer and two policemen to Zhangshucun. They first found Begonia's house and, putting on a very serious look, questioned him about many things.</p>
<p>Begonia's spirit had improved a lot in the past two days. "Gentlemen, it should be my turn to speak now." He sat on the kang, very carefully answering many of their questions, then suddenly darkened his face, bravely recited all the words Yukun taught him. "I was sick at home and really didn't know anything about the embarrassing things in the Meng family. However, I can report another matter to you, that is, my daughter was abducted by a relative of the Meng family more than three months ago..."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you..." The patrol officer eagerly asked. (223)</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Biographies in the Case of the Civet Cat</h3>
<p>— Liutang</p>
<p>Li Yonghe, the younger brother of Consort Chen, according to Song Wei Tai's record, "When Empress Li entered the palace she was only ten years old, and Yonghe was only seven years old. When the Empress was about to leave, she tied a silk pouch with her hand and gave it to him, patting his back and crying: Even if you fall into decline, you must not lose this pouch. If I encounter good fortune in the future, I will definitely find you, this is my token. Later, Yonghe worked for a paper money maker and always hung the pouch on his chest. One day, he suffered from severe diarrhea and was about to die, so the paper money maker abandoned him on the side of the road. Someone from the inner courtyard saw him and took pity on him, taking him home to raise him. He was surprised that his clothes were tattered, but he had a pouch hanging on his chest, so he asked him about it, and he told him everything. The courtyard servant was shocked and surprised, because he was often ordered by the Empress to find her brother. The courtyard servant then asked in detail about his surname, given name, genealogy, and everything. He untied his pouch and showed it to the Empress the next day, and told her the whole story. At this time, the Empress was titled Consort Chen and had already given birth to Emperor Renzong. When she heard this, she was both sad and happy, so she told Emperor Zhenzong about it, and he gave him an official position."</p>
<p>According to this, it is a Song Dynasty notebook, and there are many places that do not match historical records. (1) The Empress at that time was not Consort Li, but Empress Liu. (2) The one who visited was Empress Liu, not Consort Li herself, and Emperor Renzong had already ascended the throne, so Empress Liu sent Liu Mei and Zhang Huaide to visit Consort Li's relatives. Wei Tai's statement that he told Emperor Zhenzong about it is a big mistake, because Emperor Zhenzong had already passed away. (3) Consort Li was titled Consort Chen, and was already critically ill. The search for Li Yonghe was at the beginning of Emperor Renzong's reign. The only thing that is the same is that history also says that Li Yonghe was poor in his youth and lived in the capital, making paper money for a living. Liu Mei sought Yonghe among the people and奏 made him an official. When Emperor Renzong knew that he was Consort Li's son, he bestowed favor on his maternal relatives and gave him the official position of military governor of Zhangxin Army, co-equal with the Chancellors, and after his death, he was given the posthumous title of Grand Tutor, Chancellor of the Central Secretariat, and Prince of Longxi. At that time, he was generally known as the Emperor's Uncle Li.</p>
