<h3 id="c11">新春中的國際動態 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>六日例假，瞬又屆滿，迴顧此數日間的國際情勢，杌隍動盪，有加無已；民治獨裁之爭，秩序侵略之戰，均漸進而入於白熱關頭；而十年來國際危局的總淸算，亦隨此度陽春蒞臨而漸臻滿盈。茲就連日事態略作檢討，俾明其未來之歸趨。</p>
<p>今日國際大局之重心，一在於英國對軸心在歐非兩洲的角逐，一在於太平洋醞釀中的形勢的變化。以前者而論，則侵略國家頹勢日著，原爲無可諱飾的事實。義大利在巴爾幹與利比亞以至肯雅阿比西尼亞至索謀利蘭，悉皆潰敗踵接，傷亡慘重；而且統帥迭易，軍心動搖，義方的法西斯當局，於此已感挽救之乏術。義國內部發生變亂與夫德軍控制義國的傳說，固猶有待於確證，要非盡出意外；而齊亞諾等三人以樞臣身分而親赴戰陣，亦足見義國危機已到一髮千鈞之時。德義兩巨頭在貝許德加登會晤之後，歷時經旬，惟聞納粹準備對英攻勢之積極，初未見其於義國之阽危有所匡救；英軍更復在北非四路發動攻勢，顯謀一舉肅淸地中海南岸之義方實力，俾得激底解除近東與埃及所受威脅；德空軍縱在地中海方面爲義國聲援，但對此亦無功效可期。最近羅馬尼亞鐵衛團的叛變，結果是更强化了羅方對軕心的依附，但如果德國不準備付出過多代價普冒著與蘇士發生衝突的重大危險，預料其終難在多瑙河南與黑海西南岸有所發展，同時亦無以挽回軸心在北非與中東的頹勢，而義大利始終總是德方艱苦支撑中的重大負担。也正因爲如此，所以希特勒斷不會聽任此種形勢繼續拖延，一定要竭力營謀，以求一逞。傳聞德方正在結集軍力，準備在春初大舉侵英，這是很可能而且近情的推測。更就太平洋兩岸情勢來看；日本的軍事主力雖仍被凍結在中國戰塲上，國際關係與經濟地位也都有每况愈下之勢，然所流露的南進意念則近日轉趨積極。更自美日兩國的政治季節相繼屆臨之後，彼此已各自在議會壇玷上展開了針鋒相對的搏戰。就最近情形看，美國援助法案的通過並付之實施，大體可無問題；而孤立派的一再阻撓，往返質辯，却也虛耗了不少的寶貴時間。與此遙遙相對的，日方在種種對外營謀相繼失敗之後，最近態度轉趨極端，松岡在衆院預算委員會公然聲言要求對於東亞與西太平洋的支配控制權，將不顧國際間任何干涉或反對；復於此際力謀調解存在已久的泰越戰爭，藉謀在印支半島南部攫取有利的軍事據點。此外對華則重彈求和舊調，對蘇則亟謀調整關係，對三國同盟則一反十二月九日松岡談話所表示的態度，聲稱不準備逃避盟的義務；這都暗示着日閥頗有不顧一切後果，在美方措置完成之前從事先發制人的可能。這三個同盟國家現在同樣處於進退維谷的窘境，同時也都在竭力覓取挽救危難的最後途徑，這是從最近各方動向中可以充分看出的一點。</p>
<p>以目前情勢與一年以來相比較，民治國家處境已大見穩固，而侵略陣綫所有的機會則遠不如前此的優越，且歷時愈久，此一對比將愈形顯著，馴至使任何新的侵略企圖成爲不可能。德方大舉進攻英倫之久久未見實現，會使一些低估納粹實力者感到釋然；而日當局之突於此際對美表示强硬，也未始不可解釋做意在藉戰爭恫嚇美國，以間接增强孤立派的聲勢。然而這一類的見解，顯然並未能把握住國際前途動向，無形中看輕了在演進中的侵略危機。事實上，如果侵略者並不放棄攻勢企圖，則今後那一攻勢的實現，必不致遷延甚久，因爲適如上面所述：時間是侵略者的最大敵人，他們在過去已經失却若干可資利用的良機，此後絕不會坐視此種機會日益减少以至於無。</p>
<p>一九四〇年的春季，殆可謂爲種種罪惡登峯造極的季節；然而物窮必反，却也即在這一季節的演變之中，孕育着新的生機，從去秋到此際，整個世界都向着光明前進，無論歐局遠東都是如此。以是世人對於未來可能發生的變亂，只消戒備，無須恐怖，更何况將近十年的歷史已把最大多數的人類鍛鍊得睿智而且堅强。如果侵略者得不到出人不意，攻人不備的時機，以至種種分化誘惑欺騙蒙蔽一類伎倆的運用，其倖而獲逞的可能必極微小，這是在總淸算前夕的此際所可斷言的。</p>

<p>重慶　今晨各報社論、對蔣委員長關於新四軍事件報吿，一致熱烈擁護、（二十九日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>重慶　廿七日國府紀念週席上、蔣委員長訓詞謂、今天已是一月二十七日三十年的元月快耍過去了、在這尙未過去的五天當中、我們一般黨政軍同志、無論事務如何繁忙、應該將過去一年工作的經過、切實檢討一番、如期報吿、而對於今後一年內工作的計劃與程序、更耍具體確定、努力推進、使我們今年所作的事業、比去年更有進步、更有成績、大家耍知道、我們作戰到了今年、巳經臨到最後勝利的重要關頭、因此我們格外要戒愼恐懼、奮發努力、以促進作戰建國的成功、如此我們纔不至因循延誤、以致功敗垂成、纔可報答我們一般爲國家爲民族而流血犧牲的將士、和全國同胞、纔可以上慰總理和一般革命先烈的在天之靈、就我們此次處置新四軍事體來說、無論中外人士、大家都知道、這完全是我們</p>
<p>整飭軍紀的問題、性質很明白、問題很單純、事件也很普通、凡違反軍紀的軍人、在所必懲、至於稱兵作叛、襲搫友軍、佔領防地、妨害作戰的軍隊、更需要解決、這是作戰治軍的天經地義、從國際上來說、我們作戰迄今、將近四年、各友邦始終同情援助、無不熱烈希望我們軍隊紀律森嚴、實力增强、沒有任何友邦、因爲我們不整飭軍紀、制裁示違抗命的軍人和部隊、而表法疑惑、或猶豫的、反之、他們只有關懷與欣慰而已、允其各友邦、決不致受日人搖惑、就賢明的政治家看來、我們能整飭紀律、使我們長官和軍隊、更能堅强進步、更沒有不表贊助的、因爲各友邦肯來援助我們作戰、就是希望我們民族有自强的精神、就要注意我們政府有沒有執法治軍的能力、如果我們國民只知</p>
<p>自暴自棄我們軍人任意毀法亂紀、不從命令、不聽調遣、那這種沒有紀律的軍隊、沒有精神的民族、誰還肯來援助我們、而且我們自身也更談不到作戰了、允其我們自作戰迄今、處罰違抗命令、觸犯軍紀的案件、如韓復榘·李服膺·石友三·等案之類、已不止一次、這次新四軍因爲違抗命令、襲搫友軍、甚至稱兵作亂、破壞作戰、因而受到軍法制裁、這純然是爲了整飭軍紀、除此以外、並無其他絲毫政治或　何黨派的性質夾雜其中、這是大家都能明白的第一點、其次、我們當時對於韓復榘·李服膺·石友三·等、只是將他們三個負責主管長官正法、而對於這次新四軍事、又爲什麼要將他番號取消、部隊解散、關於這一點、我亦要向各位說明、因爲當時韓復榘·李服膺·石友三·只是其主官本人不服從命令而已、而且沒有稱兵叛亂</p>
<p>攻擊友軍的行動、各位應該知道、當時中央命令、要韓復榘堅守山東、他却不守山東、而偏要擅自退往陝西漢中、想保存他個人的實力、中央命令李服膺在前綫作戰、不許他退却、他不遵令前進、反要擅自後退、甘冒革命軍的連坐法、至於去年石友三之伏法、亦是如此、當時統帥部命令他移駐豫西、他抗命不動、盤踞豫東、騷擾地方、勒索人民、但這三個人雖然是違抗命令、而其部隊並沒有反抗叛變的行動、所以只要將他三人執行紀律、其部隊官兵、不僅無處分之必要、而且因其官兵的能深明大義、遵令整編、所以政府依舊要愛護保全、但道次新四軍一案、就與此不同了、統帥部自去年十一月以來、迭次命令、要他北上、移駐指定地區作戰、他偏按兵不動、到了最後限期已過、他還要自由</p>
<p>向南移動作一種有計劃的軍事行動、明目張膽、來襲搫第四十師、及上官雲相的總司令部、實行叛變、所以我們要執行軍紀、將他全部解散、由此可知這次解散新四軍一案、不過是我們在作戰期中、整飭軍紀普通之一例而已、並且過去因爲違反命令與紀律的部隊長官、總司令軍長師長以上的將領、現在尙在軍法執行總監部審判之中的還有十餘人、而其中也尙有作戰很艱苦、曾經立過相當戰績的、但因爲後來觸犯了軍律、不能不忍痛的交付軍法裁判、這就是表示凡是不服從命令、不遵守紀律、不履行作戰任務的軍人和軍隊、必須嚴格整頓、依法制裁、爲了全軍的生命、爲了國家的生存、爲了作戰的勝利、是決不能姑息寬假的、同時我們又決不忍錯誤判定部下的罪案、致誤了我們將士、使枉遭</p>
<p>不白之冤但自去年以來、新四軍違抗命令、違反紀律的案件、層出不窮、中央雖一再寬大爲懷、愷切吿誡、促其覺悟、豈知怙惡不悛、馴至稱兵叛變、襲搫友軍、中央在此情勢之下、就再不得有所姑息、再不能不嚴加處置、但在我個人對此事件、只有悲痛與慚愧、因爲部屬的罪惡、就是我作長官的責任、也就是我的恥辱、因此各位須知、這不是一件什麽可安慰的事、這是萬不得已的一頁痛史、現在新四軍事件雖然已經處理、而我國民革命軍、均在光榮作戰中間畢竟留下了一個汚點、我身爲統帥、我的傷心、實在任何人之上、這是大家明白認識的第二點、復次、我們爲什麽要嚴格整飭軍紀、因爲軍紀是軍隊命令之所在、亦即國家民族生命之所寄、我們作戰之成敗、就要看我們的軍隊、能吾</p>
<p>執行紀律而這次新四軍之公然稱兵抗命、破壞軍紀、我們政府能吾澈底執行紀律、就是我們國家能吾生存的最大一個關鍵、因此我這次決心要嚴肅軍紀、以挽救全軍的危亡、保障作戰的勝利、維護國家的生存、反之、如果我們這次不能整飭軍紀、任命部隊軍人違反命令、破壞紀律、那末軍隊失敗、國家就要滅亡、並且國家付托我以統帥責任、如我統帥個人希圖苟安、不惜姑息養奸、致全軍於危殆、不獨有負職責、而且對不起我們全體官兵、和一般已經爲作戰犧牲的將士同胞、並且嚴格言之、這就無異我統帥縱容部屬軍隊違法亂紀、他們陷於滅亡自殺之途、這就是我統帥莫大的罪過、因此我寗使不顧一切犧牲、必須澈底執行紀律、凡屬國民革命軍將領、必須明白軍紀重於一切、軍紀</p>
<p>一律平等、決不能稍有偏袒不公之處、亦不能因爲姑息一二少數人、而置軍紀於度外、以致作戰失敗、陷國家於滅亡、這是大家必須認識、第三點、回憶七七事變發生、作戰初起的時候、有幾個朋友勸我說、「現在我們國家的統一還沒有穩固、準備還沒有充實、國際環境更是惡劣、有許多人表面上要求政府作戰、而實際未必是誠意、所以我們還不能對日作戰、吾則就是胃險、怕要失敗、我當時就答覆他們說、諸位對於作戰大題、不能這樣看法、須看現在我們政府是革命的政府、我們的軍隊乃是革命的軍隊、我們國家與軍隊的力量、不是單靠武器裝備來與日人較量、我們不能顧慮到作戰以後可能發生的國難、苟不如此、</p>
<p>軍隊精神就要完全喪失、所以我們爲增加抵建力量、團結友軍精神、與求得最後勝利、對於此次新四軍的叛變、自不能不嚴加制裁、來維持我們抗建革命的紀律、講到這事、各位就可以得到明白的概念、就是新四軍事件的處置、本是極平常、極普通的一件事、也是我們抗建治軍中必要的處置、所有一切的宣傳和惡意的推測、乃至企圖聳動國際視聽的謠言、我敢說完全是出於日人之所爲、我並且相信我們一心抗建的任何國民、不但不會聽信謠言、且亦斷沒有一人、會跟着附和、以爲是怎麽樣一件了不得的事情、新四軍在江北江南所作違令干紀的罪惡、政府從前不予宣布、乃是愛護你們、而不是姑息、你們犯了攻搫友軍的大罪、並詆毀政府、不惜犧牲在國際上的地位、這種行爲、這種企圖這正是日人之所求、這樣不但不能掩飾你自身的罪惡、而且必爲艱苦抗建的全國軍民所唾棄、你們更無立足的餘地了、吾人眞愛國家、就要誠誠實實尊重法令、受紀律的束、自己以求有利於抗建、纔爲中國國民、（未完）</p>

<p>大會議程　並無變更</p>
<p>至於下决大會重開時之節目、仍與上决無異、但自上决中斷之處開始、業已討論之各項、將不再重複、按本月二十三日大會節目、先由領袖領事希爾宣稱、根據地皮章程第十五條擔任大會主席、决選工部局幫辦納喜爲大會秘書、繼由工部局總薰凱自威提議、副總董卡納附議、工部局自本年一月起至下次納稅外人年會舉行時止、增加市政總捐。地捐及附稅等百分之四十、並由凱氏陳述理由後、日納稅人協會會長林雄吉即上臺提出修正案、表示反對、此後主席希爾即將林氏所提修正案提交大會表決、正當贊成及反對雙方先後舉手時、林雄吉緩步上臺、槍擊案於焉發生、秩序大亂、大會遂吿中斷、下决大會重開、議程即由此繼續進行、咋晨工部局某職員、對於日納稅人所提之修正案是吾將再在二月五日大會中表決、不能確言、但工部局總董不致再對所提加捐案或日人所提修正案有所演說也、（上决大會、林雄吉提出修正案後、、凱自威即繼予强烈之反駁）、</p>

<p>日僑頓作　叫囂之聲</p>
<p>至此若干納稅人外僑與日人開始叫囂、反對此決　　、若干人要求採取「正當表決」、主席乃請反對修正案者依正常方法表明之、並稱渠認反對修正案者較贊成者爲多、時短小禿頂之納稅日人會會長林雄吉已發反對加捐之强硬演說、忽徐步從容登主席臺、當時衆對林雄吉殊不注意、因凱自威正助岡本就擴音機囑納稅日人守秩序也、</p>

<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>這又是胡適之先生的一篇論文，雖然是在去年十月二十四日所作，但是道里所說的一切，和現在的國際情勢，並沒有兩樣；並且還在繼續發展着。『挽救民治，」是一個舊的問題，美國正重行肩起了這個責任，誠然，解決這問題的鑰匙，仍在美國人民手中，羅斯福總統現正以最大努力，從事實施。這幾天正是美國會通過租賃法案的日子，我們謹以熱烈之期望，刊載這篇文字。</p>
<p>一星期前的二十四小時內發生三件要事，便是十月十六日美國實施各級廢鐵和鋼禁運出口，同日，二十一歲到三十五歲的美國靑年，遵照選役法而登記；當天午夜，封閉三月後的著名緬甸公路，重行開放，以運中國的戰具。</p>
<p>這三件事情同日發生，也　祇是巧合面已，但三件要事的確幾乎同時發生，該使我們更能明瞭它的意義，意義究竟何在呢？這便是盎格魯薩克遜民族現已完全承認；且了解中國和英帝國正在同一方面，從事同一個世界戰爭，而美利堅共和國對這戰爭，耶使不致在軍事上牽涉其中，也有在根本上受影響之虞。</p>
<p>英國所以斷然不顧日本的恫嚇而開放緬甸公路，供華方運貨，原因便在此，美政府所以遷延久之終於禁運各級廢鐵和鋼，和美國首决在承平時代抽選百餘萬靑年受軍訓，原因也在此。</p>
<p>約四個月前的七月五日，我曾於紐的世界博覽會發表下列的言論：</p>
<p>道是很重要的，世人必須明瞭今日祗有兩大强國，用武力拚死抵抗侵略，一個是英帝國，另一個便是中國。中國艱苦作戰，已經過三年悠久的歲月，我們爲自己而戰，但也有助於在他處從事同樣戰事的其他國家，我們已使最可畏的侵略國之一不能援助它歐洲的侵略元兇和伴國。」</p>
<p>那時候，有許多人士不能充分體會這些言語的眞意。英政府在兩星期後對中國封閉緬甸公路，當然也不十分明瞭這是迫害盟國而助敵的行動，且政論家公開主張應對日本妥協，庶英美能集中力量，處理歐局的，也不在稍。</p>
<p>那知上月杪，德義日三國盟的宣布，訂定日本承認並尊重德義在歐洲的領導地位，德義也承詔並尊重日本在所謂「大東亞」的領導地位。按照該的的第三條，這三個侵略國家「還須在簽的國之一遭目下並不牽涉在歐戰或中日戰事中的强國攻擊時，用一切政治經濟與軍事方法，互相援助。」盟的簽字後，德外長里賓特洛甫坦白聲稱：「任何國家若蓄意厠身於解決歐洲或東亞這些問題的最後階段中，或攻擊道三强公的簽宇國之一的，必須應付這共有二萬五千餘萬人民的三國的全部集中力量。</p>
<p>幾天後，日外相松岡也公開警吿美國說：</p>
<p>「美國若盲目地堅持着太平洋現狀，那末我們將和美國一戰。」</p>
<p>這新訂的三國盟的和訂的後的恫嚇之詞，實向全世界證明日本巳在德義方面作戰。實則從一九三六年十一月三國防共公的簽訂起，日本便成德義的盟國。在這幾月來的歐戰中，日本所以不能以較大的援助給予它歐洲的盟國，只因爲日本在中國作戰三年，愈陷愈深，無法自拔，旣已喪失百萬士兵，又大量消耗它貯積已久的軍火和兇器。它的商業，出口實業，和國家金融，都被戰爭所摧毀。它持有的黄金，幾已完全吿竭，而祇次於英美海軍的日本海軍，必須保持它接濟路錢的暢通，以達它在華作戰，現已擴展到二千餘哩的前綫</p>
<p>簡言之，中國的三年作戰，才使日本的實力大爲削弱，而不再能有效地援助它的歐洲盟國或在歐戰時乘機選肥而大肆刦掠。我以爲這一點，是中國在目下舉世挽救民治的奮鬥中，所擔任一部份負責的重大意義，足以傳諸史乘。</p>
<p>但我們的共同問題是「挽救民治」，民治常受强有力的黷武侵略者所脅害。現代民治政度的發展，先是發生在英倫三島，繼而發生在北美，這並非祇是歷史上的偶然事件而已。那時候，孤立以避黷武侵略，是自由的民治制度逐漸發展的必要條件。</p>
<p>但現在的世界，被擾亂得這麼狹小，已不再能守孤立，而「挽救民治」問題，已成莫可分離的挽救全世界民治的問題。在這世界上我國人民的生活和自由，旣不得安全，美國人的生活之道，也不再能高枕無憂，在這世界上，眞正文明而尊尙民治，愛好和平的人民，像丹麥人，挪威人，荷蘭人和比利時人，還不得安全，那末，英法美國等列强，也沒安全可言。現在美利堅共和國在承平時代微募靑年，還擬耗資五百萬萬兀，充實國防，無非因爲在這世界各地民治都不得安全。</p>
<p>所以，「挽救民治」的問題，也就是舊時「使世界民治得安全」的問題。</p>
<p>二十三年前，美國曾爲「使世界民治安全」而戰，一戰而勝，但是失了和平，那時美國避不擔任建立世界新秩序以推行和平和終止一切戰爭的偉大任務，結果所產生的世界秩序，沒權履行它自己的決定和法律，我們親眼見到世界秩序遭受殘忍的迫害，被扯成粉碎。</p>
<p>現在我們又相聚一堂，考量同一個「挽救民治」的舊問題。</p>
<p>解決這問題的鑰匙，仍在美國人民的手中，如果能够的話，美國不必捲入戰渦，但有兩件事，美國必須做到，第一件是美國須以種種有效的援助，給予中國和英帝國，以求戰勝。第二件是戰勝時（我擔保必勝）美國務須積極參加和平的造成和維持才能建立新的國際機構，由有組織的龐大力量做後盾，使這世界上民治能安全存在，人類能安全生活，若沒美國，這種任務必將又吿失敗。</p>

<h3 id="c94">經濟業談　財神 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>恭喜發財，此爲新年初相見之酬應語，余初時嘗　長者於新年相逢，五道寒暄，於恭喜之後，必曰新年（或稱獻歲）如意，以相祝頌，若元旦在立春之後，亦有謂新春如意者。商人則呼恭喜發財，或新年得利，蓋商人所重者利，自以「發財」爲唯一之希望。雖然，發財固人人之所欲也，故其　一般社會中新年唯一之　頭語，亦皆云恭喜發財。實則「如意」二字之涵義大，事事如意，發財自在其中。若謂惟發財纔能如意，似於財欲之外，無其他可以如意者，此則世俗之見或如是，未可視爲衆意盡如此也。</p>
<p>商業新聞，與工商界關係較密切，天天所談，日日朋記，無非商品買賣之行市，與夫情况之變遷。而寒假復刊，又爲工商界習俗相沿接財神之日，因有謂本日（正月初四日）出版之報紙爲「財神報」。</p>
<p>記者編輯本刋亦將垂十載，未嘗與讀者談財神，今乘辛巳年履端伊始，效世俗之所云，聊就聞見所及，於財神報上談財神，爲閱報諸君祝財運昌隆何如！</p>
<p>財神，世所謂掌財帛之神。God　of　Wealth中國之所以多神，正爲中國人心目中，以爲人間有此事，天上有此神，天上人間，理無二致。故史記天官書所言天上星宿與人間禍福之關係，固同出於一思源也。至於趨吉避凶，求福免災，人無論黄白，地無論束西，時無論占今，正不必互相醜詆，一則求之於一元之上帝，一則求之於多兀之神祗，其揆固一也。茲所談非談宗敎，無非應景；亦非爲於民權時代談神權，要知民間風俗之山來，自有其民衆心理在焉。</p>
<p>何以謂之爲財帛之神，此則須知中國之帛，在物物交換時代，爲交易媒介物之一種。中國雖早有鉍文，但以帛爲商品作交換之工具者，直至唐中葉以後，銀漸盛行，始慚消滅，因之財帛二字，聯用爲財貨之通稱。</p>
<p>財帛之神，始於何時，大的自古已有之，如祀竈，臘祭，以及種種祀典，均無非酬神祈福報之一點用意耳！但世俗所崇奉之財神，有賜福財神，有五路財神，亦有所謂黑虎趙玄壇，均財神也。賜福財神，戴　頭，衰服佩紳，相傳爲天官也。天官之一名稱，始見於周官，舊時常以六部中之吏部尙書擬之。但此之所謂天官，乃道家所尊之紫薇帝君也。紫</p>
<p>「中宮，天極星；其一明者，太一常居也。旁三星，三公，或曰子屬。後句四星，末大星，正妃，餘三星，後宮之屬也。環之匡衛十二星，藩臣，皆曰紫宮。</p>
<p>史記「索隱云：案春秋合誠圖云：紫薇大帝寳，太一之精也。正義云：太一，天神之最尊貴者也。」至漢武帝用毫人謬忌言，始祀太一。唐代崇奉更盛。天寳初，兼祀八宮，謂之九宮貴神，玄宗曾改中書省爲紫薇省，故白居易詩中，有「紫薇花對紫薇郞，」與韓竑之「春城無處不飛花」同爲單傳句。紫薇郞即稱中書省之官，中書省猶舊時之內閣軍機處，今之行政院。宋神宗天聖七年詔於京中建太一宮，祀太一神，神像用通天冠，絳紗袍，今習見廳堂中所張掛天官圖之服章，殆本於此。然民間何以至今仍流行天官圖，一則以其能降福鎭凶；宋史禮志有云：</p>
<p>「太一一星，在紫宮門右，天一之南，號曰天之貴神。……卞使十六神，知風雨水早兵革飢饉疫疾災害之事。唐書曰，九宮貴神，實司水旱，太一堂十六神之法度，以輔人極。」</p>
<p>此民間張掛天官圖之由來。再則以天官爲貴神，故仕宦人家允喜於廳堂之上應天官像，名之曰加官晋爵圖，即舊時戲劇開塲，一伶人絳袍　頭，戴面具，持象笏，作舞蹈狀，名之曰「天官賜福」，稱之爲跳加官。如有官員在座，一再跳加官，以相取悅，官員亦以紅紙賞封遙擲台上以酬之，伶人又以「指日高升」「一品當朝」好口識字眼以報之。</p>
<p>何以民間又奉之爲賜福財神，此則須知中國爲農業國家，但求「風調雨順，五穀豐登」，即可達到「國泰民安」。而太一之爲神，有如天寳三年十月六日勑中所謂</p>
<p>一九宮貴神，實司水旱，功佐上帝，德庇下人，翼嘉糓幾登，災害不作」。</p>
<p>夫能使嘉穀歲登，災害不作，是則非但降福。亦且賜財，中國之財富出於農，太一神，果有如此法力，安得不奉之爲賜福財神耶！</p>
<p>然商界所祀之財神，爲五路財神，此父從商人本身事業着想；蓋商貨來向四方，故必四方吿有財神，而後財不至落空。五路者於東南西北四方之外，加以本身營業所在之「中」，而五方之財斯全矣。五路財神，皆作頂盔貫甲狀，與賜福財神之華貴堂皇，逈不相同。有謂五路財神係綠林出身，義結金蘭，故作糾糾武夫狀。亦有謂此即五方五甲之神也。或謂即鄉間所祀五通五聖之流也。惟祀之者必以野味，羊頭猪首，烏腊鯉魚，（上海稱爲元寳魚，以紅綫穿其脊鰭，蓄於水盆中以祀神，祀畢，有放之於豫園荷花池中，亦有縱之於黄浦江頭。故正月初四日常聞小販肩挑求售，大呼「阿要買元寳魚」之聲也）。鷄用白雄鷄，酒用燒酒，皆取其色白，象徵白銀也。</p>
<p>尙有請藏神，祭主須具白衣冠迎祀之，且謂不可使人見，問以故，則謂藏神亦白衣冠也。又謂見有白老鼠，其間必有藏銀。嘗疑白老鼠主財，說何自來，如今之所玩洋老鼠，固皎潔如雪人乃非中國人所謂之白老鼠也。若趙玄壇之爲財神，明陸燦庚已編嘗記其神異之說：謂具</p>
<p>「里人張廷芳，好鬥蟋蟀，爲之輒敗，至　家具以償焉，遂蕩其產。素敬事玄壇神，乃以誠禱，訴其困苦。夜夢神曰：「爾勿憂，吾遣黑虎助爾，今化身在天妃宮東南角樹下，汝往取之」。張往掘土，獲一蟋蟀，深黑色而甚大，用以鬥，無弗勝者，旬日間獲利如所喪者加倍一。</p>
<p>但趙玄壇始於何時，仍未能得悉。又商店中之市招堅於櫃台之上者，稱爲靑龍招牌，靑龍主財喜，開市日嘗張財神模於靑龍市招上，詢之商家，但知其然，而不知其所以然。前年得晤西藏榮增堪布，方知藏密之中，有至尊最勝聖白財神法，其說固與今民問所傳五路財神及靑龍白鼠若相符合也榮增大法師，爲十六世班禪大師大弟子之一，深通顯密敎義，故爲班禪駐華宗敎全權代表。又任嘉穆彥呼圖克圖敎導師，遂有榮增堪布之尊稱。嘗云二聖白財神，一面二臂，右手持三义矛，左手持楞棒，坐於靑龍之上。東爲藍色金剛空行母，右持金剛，左持盛滿各種因緣具足之器。南爲黄色寳座空行母，右持寳盆，左持鐵鈎。西爲紅色蓮花空行母，右持蓮花，左持五寳莊嚴之法幢。北爲綠色事業空行母，右手持交义金剛，左持白鼠。誠如此說，固與中國五路財神之數相符。且北方之財神持白鼠，遂以見白鼠謂將得橫財。財神稱爲白財神，不知者乃誤以爲穿白衣服之神，而亦以白衣服迎之矣。因白財神騎靑龍，故以靑龍爲財喜（此亦見於六畜之說）。財神皆作金剛並持有义鈎楞棒之屬，於是中土之五路財神，亦作項盔貫甲之狀。　焉知所祀五路財神，不由藏密所　之白財神傳述而來，向因密宗不許流傳於漢土，故但知有　說，以誤傳誤，遂有今日世俗之誤會。自榮增大法師卓錫滬上，宏揚藏密，白財神法，乃得流傳於世。</p>
<p>曾詢以佛敎何以有財神？師述：　尊者曾見一道旁餓莩，不　哀憫，思至城中乞食以食之，但歸來已不及救濟，欲割肉相飼，則餓莩不受；尊者左右思維，迄乏善策，因思世間惟貧窮爲大可憐。乃求敎於觀世音菩薩，菩薩乃於一眼中顯出綠度母，以度世人；一眼中顯出白財神，以福世人，救濟貧窮，無使流離顚沛，受盡苦痛，此大慈大悲救苦救難之仁心，乃欲享　財富者，能爲大衆造福，自利利他。若以損人利己爲事，剝削居積爲能，而致富起家者，獨不念財固可貴，福須修來，利人利己，方爲財福雙修。古語有云：作善降之百祥，作不善降之百殃，因果自然之律，固有不容盡沒。深願有財富者，善用其財，無以財多爲祟，用以禍人，不以福人，則如財神有靈，亦將深悔其處理之不允，而失唱利公衆之本意也。</p>
<h3 id="c95">菸曹史話 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>說起來，在近代新發現的許多植物中，沒有比「菸草」更幸運的受大多數人歡迎的了！自從十五世紀末葉，哥倫布脚踏到新大陸上以後，以迄現在，從遠東到泰西，幾乎到處都有它的足跡，它的魔力眞是小小！</p>
<p>菸草的祖國，是在西印度小安的列期羣島中，一個離委內瑞拉國不遠，現在屬英國管轄的名叫Tabago的小海島上，西班牙人稱菸草爲Tabacco，和我國從前譯作淡巴菇的，就是從它這原產地而來，當着公元一四九二年，哥倫布和他的同伴首先在古巴島登陸的時候，他們就看見印第安土人們嘴裏啣着一團着火的乾草，而一口一口的吸它的氣氛，後來他們在西印度羣島的全部，幾乎到處可見這同樣的舉止，原來印第安人的抽烟，不但是爲它那醉人的香氣，還是以爲它「能治百病」，能得到神的助力，巫覡們也當着被它那麻醉人的濃烟薰燎的頭昏眼花的時候，開始宣布吉凶的朕兆，就如同古希臘Delphes神廟的女巫，在咀嚼月桂樹的苦葉到了神志昏迷的時候，纔代替阿坡羅大神預言來一樣，奇怪的是當地的戰士們，在兩軍對壘以前，得抽上「一袋鼓勵勇氣的烟」講和時也一定要先送給對方一隻「和平的烟袋」，至於印第安人那雕鏤精工的烟袋，眞堪稱爲藝術品的，哥倫布的同伴及其後繼者，看見菸草對於土人是那麼　有神秘性，不由的也嘗試起來；幸運兒的菸草，這纔大踏步的走上康莊大道！</p>
<p>果然，這含有尼古丁毒素的植物，借着西班牙或葡萄牙的水手們——那發現美洲的哥倫布的同伴們，或征服墨西哥的科爾歹斯Cortez的同伴們——的助力，在十五世紀末年已竟喬遷到歐洲的伊比利半島上，然而抽烟這種習俗，要不是有法國的宮廷提倡於上，朝臣風靡於下，它或者現在還限制在幾個卑微的水手們當中也未可知呢，原來在公元一五六〇年，有法國的一位住葡萄牙大使名叫尼古（Jean　Nicot1530.1600）的，從接收的禮物當中，得到幾粒烟草的種子，那時烟草已竟是以能治病特別是頭痛症馳名遐通的了，尼古於是把這幾粒種子在自己的花園裏培植起來，親自試騐了它那「萬應散」的妙葉的能力，然後用精於趨奉的廷臣的姿態，把烟葉的細紛貢獻給法國的太后美的西喀德隣（Cathetine　de　Medicis），她那時正患着不時復發的頭痛症呢，太后信任無疑的聞起鼻烟來，也愛好了它：於是廷臣亦步亦趨的跟着學，不久就風靡草偃的普及到法國整個的社會。烟草的官銜提高，被稱爲「太后草」了，人從它裏面化騐出來的毒素，却用了尼古的尊名，另外還有一個推波助瀾的人，就是那名叫梯外（AndtreThivet）的敎士，他在一五六六年遊歷巴西，看見土人們吸烟，便把烟草和利用的法子，與尼古不謀而同的傳到法國，在他的著作中還說：「在巴西有一種名叫Petun的草人，說它能凈化腦中的黏液，對身體很是有益，但設若吸人過多，則亦能如濃酒一般能醺醺醉人」，英國的傳入烟草稍在其後，是在一五八六年那著名的海上冒險家Drake從美洲回國時把它和馬鈴薯一齊帶回去的，自此以後，吸烟或聞烟的習慣，便由近及遠，慢慢傳到了各處。</p>
<p>至於亞洲方面的情形，葡萄牙人和西班牙人，旣然在十六世紀初葉先後佔領了南洋羣島和斐律濱羣島，烟草的栽種當然也是從此時聚始，我國和斐律濱相距只是一衣帶水，當然也首先由閩粤二省人得到了烟草的種子，把它廣佈起來，所以中國人記載烟草的起源，大概只是說：「烟一名相思草，漢文曰淡巴菰，初出呂宋明季始入中國，近日無人不用，雖　閨稚女，金管錦囊，與鏡　牙尺並陳矣」，（見茶餘客話）。</p>
<p>烟草的用法有三種，咀嚼，聞，吸，第一種似乎並未傳開，第二種也受了淘汰，現在盛行各處的只是吸的一種，烟管烟斗，是美洲印第安人的創作，水烟袋則是波斯人的發明，這兩種東西是何時，由何人或怎樣傳到了我國？我只能書個間號。</p>
<p>現在附帶着談談菸草傳到了舊大陸以後，惹起了什麽樣的反響，首先對於菸草加以激烈無情的攻擊的，當然是醫學界中的人士，然這只不過是口頭上和文字上的吶喊，一等到天主敎會，允其是那些執法森嚴的專制帝王們加入戰團，那便有好文章出來，先說英國吧，那接續女王依利薩伯的位，和主張君權神授的國王詹姆斯第（James　I），對於菸草，就有深痛絕惡的表示，他在一六一九年下諭，把全國栽種的菸草一概拔除，到了一六二八年羅馬敎皇烏爾班第八（Urbain　Ⅷ）也向菸草下了總攻擊；下令凡是在聖堂中吸烟或聞烟的人，一概驅逐出敎，土耳共的皇帝阿摩拉第四（Amurat　Ⅳ.1611-1640），他根據可蘭經禁止喝醉的條文，以爲吸烟也能叫人醉，所以他出令：凡吸烟者割其脣，聞烟者割其鼻！後來甚至把絞刑加到吸烟者之身，波斯的國王阿拔期第一（Abbas　1，1557-1628）更爲峻嚴，凡吸烟聞烟的人一概剝皮草楦！至於俄國的莫斯科呢，也因爲一個吸烟的人不小心引起了火災，於是大公爵Michel　Federowitch，在一六五〇年出令禁止吸烟，初犯者鞭笞，復犯者處死。……故吸烟之在當時，常受到許多的非難和酷刑呢？</p>
<p>可是有人要問，這些禁烟的成絨怎樣？答案是無效，所謂禁者自禁，吸者自吸，甚至有人不惜犧牲性命，干冒國禁的去吸烟，於是這禁烟的舉措，相反地，簪菸草作了反宣傳，吸烟者一天一天的增多起來，到了俄國彼得大帝周遊西歐完畢，於一六九八年回國的時候，竟一變歷來政府遏制的態度，而命「不論嗜好與吾，凡是俄國人都要學吸烟」，這是我知道的公然提倡吸烟的惟一的君主！後來各國政府，看見禁烟也是無效，反而利用起它來了，有的專賣，有的抽稅，現在道菸草一物，能替各國政府賺進多麽大的一批收入啊！</p>

<h3 id="c96">廿九年紗布之波折 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>紗花業之在二十九年、變化多端、波浪滔天、中間雖有失敗、結果仍多獲利、然實際上無前年之稱心、因中途上下進出、範圍距離太遠、高低差額在于元以外、有一部遭受挫折、大傷元氣、雙馬紗價比上年增漲一倍餘、此其經過大略如後、</p>
<p>（一）在二十八年度歲暮、多數意見尙平淡、二十支雙馬紗價爲七百三十五元、過年紅盤開始、情况尙平、旋以投機人們、紛紛活動、同時外滙步軟、而內地需要旺盛、於是紗市受兩重力量推動、當然逐步昂騰、此時市塲有分期現紗兩種交易、一時處於投機潮流中、超出常軌之外、二十支雙馬最高峰曾見一千六百六十元、期貨曾達一千八百元外、豈料五月二日以後外滙突然放升、市塲頓時劇變、猶似靑天霹靂、市盤急轉直下、竟如河堤、一瀉千里、莫可挽回、於是紗號倒閉、經理躱走、市塲爭噪、及動武打架、時有所聞、</p>
<p>（二）直至六月中二十支雙馬最低價爲破進千元大關、爲八百元、與五月中之頂高價一千八百元較、相差一千元、投機大傷元氣、最苦痛有一批套利戶、高價之貨已收進、到下月期交貨、無人接受、買者倒閉、避不見面、結果虧本殊巨、一塲投機在潮、到此吿一結束、所以在七八九三個月迥旋在九百元之間、作一長途之休憩、</p>
<p>（三）踏進九月底至十月初、因一般投機人們、父作死灰復燃、靜極思動、同時「取引所」成立開幕、將市上浮貨之二十支日紗紛粉收進、以作該所籌碼之需要、二則新棉登塲、某方嚴厲統制、來源阻止、本埠小銀行開創、竟如雨後春筍、大家直奔紗市塲而來、且客方無錢收貨、可墊款代收、假使賣出無貨、可代爲交貨、如斯一來、一變完全投機化、於是你進我買、籌碼一時不敷分配、市價乃扶搖直上、所以至年暮最高見一千四百五十九元之價、各號及投機的人們、總結束下來、尙能大吉大利、有許多化險爲夷、因之大家依然笑顏常開、迎接五路財神、希望來年勝上年、然布價之昂、平民担負不了、</p>
<p>查紗價高昂、最大之原動力、不外乎游資充斥、投機的人們、關積在棧中不賺錢不賣、上年暮歲之上升、因外滙復縮、紗由一千二百元漲至一千四百元外、最後滙票已轉長、而廿支紗原料仍廉、紅盤之價、是升是降、殊難逆料也、</p>

<p>自歐戰發生以來，世界各國，咸以食糧自給自足爲立國第一耍義。吾國之天時地利，均爲世界唯一之農業國，乃今觀以上所述，則知吾國非特不能自給自足，目須仰給於他國，而每年輸入更有逐漸增加之趨勢，此與强國富民之原理，絕對背道而馳，故今後外米輸入之數字，不可不日望其减少，換言之，即國內之生產額，不可不日望其增加，而外鑠之原因，不得不望其减少也。</p>
<p>今日之言平米價者，或曰當仍輸入外米，以補不足；或曰拍嚴禁囤積，以防騰貴；但米糧缺乏，固需補充，囤積居奇，固應禁止，要之此乃治標之方策，難收根本之效。必也獎進農業，推廣墾地，俾得增加米之產額，而謀米糧需給之調和，對於下列各點，應行注意：</p>
<p>（一）提倡農業敎育，獎進農事，以發展我國農業，而成一眞正之農業國家。</p>
<p>（二）利用吾國土地之大，人民之衆，使產米區域之生產力，啟發無餘，各處荒蕪之地，允當儘量開闢。</p>
<p>（三）般奸商對於民食前途應顧全大局，勿以食米爲投機之工具。</p>
<p>（四）各產米區域仍須播種稻禾，不應以錙銖之利，致使肥沃之土，棄禾稻而改植他物。</p>
<p>上述種種，而能切實行之，必有顯著之成績，五年之後，可無求於外米之輸入，十年之後，且可以所餘者供銷於外國，是皆在我國上下之能吾努力爲轉移耳。（完）</p>

<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>考完了有兩個禮拜，到學校去拿回我的畢業證書，那上面我戴着方帽子，滿臉的笑－好像是有着無限希望…　的確在照那張像的時候是懷着無限希望的——有盛名的大學裹出來的工程學士，還會沒有希望？</p>
<p>但，這學士從他得到學位到今天，是兩個禮拜了，除了自己關在亭子間裏歎氣，到外面去找兩個跟自己同命運的朋友，就只有挾起點衣服書籍上當舖去。還有什麽事可以給他做呢？</p>
<p>家裏來了信，聽說我畢了業，希望能寄一點錢回去，可是我　在連自己也不能生活下去了。從箱子裏拖出最後的一件綢衫，走上街去。</p>
<p>從高高的櫃臺上，換下三塊二角大洋，和一陣輕蔑的冷笑，我逃出當舖。</p>
<p>走到街上，冷風故意跟我開玩笑，吹得跟樹葉子一樣簌簌地發抖。前面一堆人擠在那兒看什麽，我下意識地張了一下，是個吿地狀的：</p>
<p>「難民前北平　　小學敎師……</p>
<p>……飢寒交迫……求助……』</p>
<p>來不及看完－不，不敢仔細看，我惶恐地擠出人國。回家。無意識地翻開報紙，都是自殺，失業；失業，自殺……</p>
<p>我閉上眼睛，頸腦感到昏漲。忽然，一個幻影，我好像自己坐在人行道上，蜷縮着身子，旁邊－</p>
<p>「難民　　大學工程學士……』</p>
<p>我恐怖地跳了起來。</p>
<p>「啊，不能，不能，我是工程學士，學士，……畢業不是失業，……新中國在成長着……學士……』</p>

<h3 id="c104">英姑娘 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 榮耀</p>
<p>前房裏跳舞的英姑娘，誰都知道她的去跳舞，並不是爲了經濟的壓迫，而是出於十二萬分的自願，經過了無數决的哀求，才獲得她那死要面子的母親的「千金一諾』。她簡直是比登了王位還要歡喜。</p>
<p>要是你跟英姑娘談上一回，你便知道她是一個最歡喜「小白臉」的人，她的　鋒常會轉到關於「小白臉』的一方去。當然囉在英姑娘心目中未來的『乘龍快婿』自然是一位風流倜儻年輕貌美的小白臉了。父那裏知道她現在的丈夫，竟是一個四十多歲又矮又胖的大塊頭呢！</p>
<p>常她的母親向她提起這親事時，她第一句便問道：『多大啦？』</p>
<p>『只小過是四十歲吧了，』她母親毫不在意的答道。</p>
<p>『甚麽？四十歲了嗎？」她却大驚小怪地嚷了起來。</p>
<p>『啊，不老，不老，一點也不老。一隻面孔圓圓的，怪討人歡喜，眞看不出他是個四十歲的人，聽說他是在外國輪船上當　辦的，光說財產，也積有好幾十萬呢。妳嫁了他，一生就不愁穿，不愁吃，好女兒，你去看看，便相信我的說話了。』她母親憑着她那『三寸不爛之舌』極力地勸解着。爲了聽說有幾百萬家當，英姑娘是有點心動了，使答應跟她母親去看。</p>
<p>那位買辦先生眞是『善觀氣色，』他只跟英姑娘說上幾句話，便摸透了她的心事，從袋裏摸出五六個銀行摺子來，演說般地說道：『這裹的五萬塊錢，是我大兒子的敎育費和結婚費；這個是我小兒子的……假使你願意嫁我的話，我可以馬上給你母親三千元養老費，一千元酒席費，還可以給你幾千塊錢存入銀行。』</p>
<p>把這愛好虛榮的英姑娘，聽得有點迷糊了，這時的她，只幻着坐汽車，住洋房，吃大菜……甚麽『小白臉，』『大白臉』都給暫時丢開了。便很高興地答應下來。</p>
<p>回得家來，只聽見英姑娘說：『媽，那人頭髮也白了，你還說不老。』</p>
<p>『胡說，做大生意的人，用腦過度，頭髮總是白得快的。再說，你現在已是人家的人了，明天跟他上街的時候，要顯得親熱一點才是。』『和這末老的人走在一起，碰見熟人，怪難看的。』</p>
<p>『胡說。』</p>
<p>婚後第三天，那位買辦便要動身了，聽說要隔一個多月才回來；臨行時，留下五百塊錢的安家費，還特地伴她去買金戒子，無綫電，大衣，睡衣，地毯，餅乾糖果……許多東西，最後還要她進一所補習學校裹去補習，差不多花上一千塊銷。</p>
<p>買辦去後一星期，英姑娘爲了要實踐她的享樂主義，便大吃大用起來了。管他媽的讀書不讀書，高興便去一去。看戲，打牌，抽烟，上館子，甚麽都有她一份兒。錢像水一樣的用出去，只不過是短短的三十多天功夫，五百塊錢便給花個乾乾凈凈。</p>
<p>呀，糟糕啦，錢已用光了，人還不見回來，英姑娘便像熱鍋子上的螞蟻一樣，整天在屋子裏打轉，不停地翻日曆。</p>
<p>隔壁好婆打趣道：『怪不道人家說「一夜夫妻百夜恩」，眞是一點也不錯，你們看英姑娘多心焦啊！』</p>
<p>『瞎說，誰希罕他的人，等他的錢吧了。』英姑娘冷冷地說。</p>

<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>有一位在香港的朋友，臂部生瘡，正在施行外科手術，不幸在臥病期內又突然吐血，經X光檢騐，斷爲右肺出血。醫生對朋友說，一年後才復原。在這樣痛苦的病床上，朋友的信中却寫着下列幾句勇敢的話：『我請你們放心，我對於凡是賜給我的東西，無論是疾病，痛苦，我都以勇氣接受，並且希望從中獲得好處。我，現在有許多時間思索，讀書同時又正在體騐一種「新生活」我這種「塞翁失馬」的態度，希望差你們不要笑我「酸葡萄」。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>然而再一想，又使財迷了心的榮奎胆壯起來。那個老婆子不是說只要他若够想法子使秋海棠和掌櫃的媳婦單獨見上一面，他　可以得到兩百塊現洋和一雙金鐲兒嗎？兩下加起來，至少也有三百多塊錢，拼着一年沒有生意，也虧不了什麽，何况他想：</p>
<p>「年輕的男人和女人一見面，那會不歡喜之理？只要老板歡喜，就不怕他再訴袁老七，而自己的飯碗，還有什麼危險呢？」</p>
<p>可是再想，父怕事情一旦鬧破，王掌櫃的一定要跟秋海棠打官司，那時候他豈不也要連累進去嗎，這樣想想，榮奎的心倒又寒起來了。</p>
<p>但一霎眼，另一個念頭又湧了起來：</p>
<p>「呸！怕他什麼！王堂櫃統共不過是一個開綢緞莊經紀人，旣不做官，又不帶兵，即使事情鬧破，怕他什麽呢？一</p>
<p>接着，又從袁紹文的身上，反使他想出了一個計蚊來：王家的媳婦不是先想單獨和秋海棠見見嗎？只要由己湊一個空，借袁七爺的名宇，把秋海棠騙到約定的飯館子裏去，不是很容易的事嗎？</p>
<p>榮奎越想越順利，險些高興得就在路上跳起來。</p>
<p>這一晚，王大奶：果然又打扮得花朵一樣的坐在池子裏，不斷的向臺上的秋海棠，送過含有無限深情的眼波來；秋海棠也開始有些察覺了，因爲他看得很淸楚，這個女人在最近的一個半月裹，不管自己在那裏出臺，總是獨坐在池子前面的第二三排中間，對他聚精會神的注視着，連大風大雨的日子也沒有間斷過，當然他是知道她的用意的，並且也曾幾决對她發生過憐惜的心理。他想：</p>
<p>「這樣深情的女人，倒也的確是很可以感激的。」</p>
<p>然而回到後臺，心裹稍稍安靜之後，便立刻又想到了袁紹文平日勸勉他的話，以及他在幾年中屢次竭力替自己解圍，不使患着高度色情狂的袁鎭守使，對自己有什麽非禮的舉動。（一七）</p>

<h3 id="c108">黛麗愛莉絲 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>三年前的上海女學生　新片「雙十年華」要角</p>
<p>業已運滬即將開映的哥倫比亞新片Girls　Under　21（暫譯雙十年華」）的要角，黛麗愛莉絲，三年前尙在上海過女學生生活，做着到好萊塢去的明星夢，而今已如願以償，躍登銀壇，她的處女作最近便能與上海人仕見面，和她曾一起玩過的小朋友，見了上面這張照片，或許已想不起，要是把她的眼鏡去掉，再加上二根髮辮，就能很親切地記憶起這個玩皮的小姑娘了。</p>
<p>黛麗在西童公學讀書時從不注　書本，不是甩着二條小髮辮在操塲上玩，便是口不停聲地唱歌，足不停步地跳蹕躂舞，她的母親也喜歡這一套，對於她的投身銀幕，很早就有了預擬的計劃。她是校中演劇時的惟一主角，而且曾在本埠XMHA電台所主催的偉大播音節目中担任歌唱，從小似乎她已一定能成爲他日的明星。滬戰爆發時，她的父母携她離開上海，買棹至加利福尼亞的日光海岸，經過香港時曾在她的母親導演下登台演戲，在夏威夷播音，參加商人宴會，爲敎育大厦揭幕，沿途顯得她是非常活躍，到達目的地後，就投入當地最負盛名的歌劇訓練專校，作投身銀幕的張本。</p>
<p>十三歲的黛麗終於在嚴格考試下勝利而加入哥倫比亞公司爲基本演員，與大明屋小范朋克等同事。在新片中她扮演一個女學生企圖加入暴徒集團，最後在緊張的演進中被殺。她演個性堅强的女性獲得意外成功，因之當局認爲是能演複雜個性的有希望演員，報章雜誌亦譽之爲新起的最佳童星。</p>

<p>— 楊蘭</p>
<p>民華影業公司在「孔夫子」完成後，除早已公吿的「世界兒女」在積極進行外，據記者所知，一方面他們還正在暗暗地進行着「閃電戰略」。</p>
<p>民華這次的合作者，是上海戲劇學校。上海戲劇學校的小舉生們一百餘人在黃金的歷次演出，是博得評劇界的一致好評的，不僅人才輩出，而羣戲的熱鬧和純熟，更是鮮見，他們之想上銀幕，那是一年前就有這意思了，那時民華正在拍「孔夫子」，戲劇學校校長陳承蔭與民的經理金信民交誼頗深（金信民爲該校校董），便談起過這件事情，惟因「孔夫子」正工作緊張，一時當然無法實現，這件事情就「且待下回分解」，直待「孔夫子」大功吿成，戲劇學校的全體學生由敎師等率領去看試片以後，雙方就舊事重提起來，而到最近，遂商定一切，決定合作。</p>
<p>合作的戲名是什麼？因關防嚴密，無法探聽到，所知者此戲之編導爲費穆，主角即爲此一百餘位之少年伶人，戲之內容則有時裝亦有平劇之舞台塲面，爲一新型之平劇化歌樂片，聞將與「世界兒女」同時開拍，因一個戲輪流着拍，可使導演及職演員們有養精蓄銳的休息機會也。</p>
<p>（編者按：接此稿後，我們　以電話詢諸費穆先生，據答云，此祗是他渴想已久的新的嘗試，劇本是早已寫好了的，至於戲名，現在因尙未確定，　不能公吿云。）</p>

<p>Chongqing Military News: (1) A unit of Japanese troops that invaded north of Yangzi, Zhongxiang on the 25th, once intruded into Jiangshanguan, while another unit sneaked into Liushuigou. In the evening, after a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the Japanese army collapsed across the board. Jiangshanguan and Liushuigou were both reported to have been recaptured. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, and on the 26th, the Chinese army advanced southward, successively capturing many key points such as Changshoudian. (2) In the Henan battle, the Chinese army has now completed its encirclement. The Japanese troops that invaded Wucheng and other places westward from Xinyang were routed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army continued to capture Huanglongsi, and the remaining Japanese troops fled towards the You River. (Telegram of the 29th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Henan battle is becoming increasingly fierce. More than 4,000 Japanese troops that invaded northward from Xinyang engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army in Minggang. On the 25th, the Japanese army reinforced its forces. After a vigorous attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. More than 2,000 Japanese troops that invaded westward from Xinyang and more than 3,000 Japanese troops that invaded northwestward from Pingchang are still engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army on the Maoji front. Another unit of Japanese troops advanced towards Yingcheng, north of Tongbai, but has been driven back by the Chinese army. (Telegram of the 29th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese troops advancing from Henan are still engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army in the Huangshapu area on the northern route. On the central route, more than 2,000 Japanese troops were ambushed and intercepted by the Chinese army's ambush units in the Maoji area on the 26th and 27th, resulting in more than 1,000 Japanese casualties and significant victories for the Chinese. On the western route, more than 2,000 Japanese troops once sneaked into the vicinity of Tongbai on the 26th, but after a vigorous attack by the Chinese, they fled eastward. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese troops who crossed the river and invaded eastward were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 26th and retreated towards Yangzi and Zhongxiang. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: More than 1,000 Japanese troops retreating between Jingmen and Dangyang were surrounded by the Chinese army's pursuing troops on the 26th. After a fierce battle lasting half a day, more than 800 Japanese were killed, and a large amount of military supplies were seized. (Telegram of the 29th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Several thousand Japanese troops invading northward on the west bank of the Xiang River have suffered heavy casualties after being intercepted by the Chinese army in separate attacks for the past five days. They have now completely collapsed and retreated. In addition to restoring their original positions, the Chinese are tracking down and pursuing the Japanese. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">First Phase Results of Savings Campaign Exceed Target <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The first phase of the savings campaign, from the "September 18th" incident to today, "January 28th," had a target of 200 million yuan. According to sources, as of the end of the old lunar year, preliminary statistics reached 230 million yuan. Various banks have been closed for the Spring Festival, and final reports from some areas are unavailable. However, based on the most conservative estimates, it is likely to exceed the 250 million yuan mark. The best savings results were achieved overseas and in the cities of Chongqing and Kunming, exceeding the target by 1-2 times. Shanghai, due to environmental factors, fell far short of the target of 50 million yuan (Havas telegram of the 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e3">China's Legal Tender Reserves are the Highest; Long-Term Financial Stability; Four Banks are Committed to Completing the Financial Network; Limited Number of Bonds Issued After the War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The joint office of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) recently issued a statement stating that loans from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to China have made the legal tender reserves higher than any other warring nation. Post-war reconstruction and trade will also be well-funded, so China's finances can be said to have been stable for a long time and are improving. In recent years, the four banks have been committed to completing the financial network and developing the economy. Last year, more than 250 new branches were established, commercial discounts and loans amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, rural loans exceeded 200 million yuan, savings from the savings campaign exceeded 15 million yuan, and ordinary current deposits exceeded 150 million yuan. (Havas telegram of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The January issue of the "Financial Review" stated that the Chinese government issued a total of eight batches of public bonds from the beginning of the war to the end of 1940, totaling 3.43 billion yuan in national currency, 100 million customs gold units, 2,000 pounds in British currency, and 100 million US dollars. Compared with the huge amount of 26 billion yuan in public bonds issued by Japan during the same period, it is truly insignificant. Before the war, the Chinese government issued only 1.952 billion yuan in public bonds and 2 million pounds in British currency through the Ministry of Finance, which is also small compared to Japan's 6 billion yuan.

<h3 id="e11">International Dynamics in the New Year <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The six-day holiday has quickly come to an end. Looking back at the international situation during these few days, the world remains unstable and turbulent, and the struggle between democracy and dictatorship, and the war between order and aggression, are gradually entering a heated stage. The overall reckoning of the international crisis over the past decade is also gradually reaching its peak with the arrival of this warm spring season. A brief review of recent events is provided below to clarify the future direction.</p>
<p>The focus of the current international situation lies in Britain's competition with the Axis powers in Europe and Africa, and in the changing situation brewing in the Pacific. Regarding the former, the decline of the aggressor nations is an undeniable fact. Italy has suffered successive defeats and heavy casualties in the Balkans, Libya, and even Kenya, Abyssinia, and Somalia. Moreover, the commanders have been repeatedly replaced, and the morale of the army has been shaken. The Italian fascist authorities have found it difficult to remedy this situation. Although rumors of internal disturbances in Italy and German control of Italy remain to be confirmed, they are not entirely unexpected. The fact that Ciano and two other ministers went to the front lines as key ministers is enough to show that Italy's crisis has reached a critical moment. After the meeting between the two German and Italian leaders in Berchtesgaden, weeks have passed, and only preparations for a Nazi offensive against Britain have been heard, with no apparent efforts to alleviate Italy's perilous situation. The British army has launched offensives on four routes in North Africa, clearly aiming to eliminate Italian power on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea in one fell swoop, so as to radically relieve the threats to the Near East and Egypt. Even if the German air force provides support for Italy in the Mediterranean, no effective results can be expected. The recent revolt of the Romanian Iron Guard has resulted in further strengthening Romania's dependence on the Axis powers. However, if Germany is not prepared to pay too high a price and risk a major conflict with the Soviets, it is expected that it will be difficult for it to develop in southern Danube and southwest Black Sea, and at the same time, it will not be able to reverse the decline of the Axis powers in North Africa and the Middle East, and Italy will always be a major burden on Germany's difficult support. It is precisely because of this that Hitler will not allow this situation to continue to drag on and will do everything possible to achieve his goals. Rumors that Germany is gathering its forces and preparing to invade Britain on a large scale in early spring are very likely and plausible speculations. Looking at the situation on both sides of the Pacific, Japan's main military force is still frozen on the Chinese battlefield, and its international relations and economic status are also deteriorating. However, its intention to advance southward has become more active recently. After the political seasons of the United States and Japan have successively arrived, they have each launched tit-for-tat battles in the parliamentary arena. Judging from the recent situation, the passage and implementation of the US aid bill are generally not a problem. However, repeated obstruction and back-and-forth debates by isolationists have wasted a lot of valuable time. In contrast, after Japan's various foreign efforts have failed one after another, its recent attitude has become extreme. Matsuoka publicly stated in the House of Representatives Budget Committee that he would demand the right to dominate and control East Asia and the Western Pacific, regardless of any international interference or opposition. At the same time, he is striving to mediate the long-standing Thai-Vietnamese war in order to seize favorable military strongholds in the southern Indochina Peninsula. In addition, Japan is repeating the old tune of seeking peace with China, trying to adjust relations with the Soviet Union, and reversing the attitude expressed by Matsuoka's speech on December 9 regarding the Tripartite Pact, claiming that it is not prepared to evade the obligations of the alliance. This all implies that the Japanese warlords are likely to disregard all consequences and take preemptive action before the US measures are completed. These three allied countries are now in the same dilemma and are all striving to find a final way to save themselves from danger, which can be fully seen from the recent trends of all parties.</p>
<p>Compared with the current situation and that of a year ago, the situation of the democratic countries has become much more stable, and the opportunities for the aggressive front are far less superior than before. The longer the time, the more obvious this contrast will become, until it makes any new attempts at aggression impossible. The long-delayed implementation of Germany's large-scale invasion of Britain has made some people who underestimate the strength of the Nazis feel relieved. The sudden hardening of Japan's attitude toward the United States at this time may also be interpreted as an intention to indirectly strengthen the voices of isolationists by threatening the United States with war. However, this kind of view clearly fails to grasp the direction of the international future and unconsciously underestimates the unfolding crisis of aggression. In fact, if the aggressors do not give up their offensive intentions, the realization of that offensive will not be delayed for too long in the future, because, as mentioned above, time is the aggressor's greatest enemy. They have already lost some exploitable opportunities in the past and will never sit idly by as these opportunities decrease until they disappear.</p>
<p>The spring of 1940 can be said to be the season when all kinds of evils reached their peak. However, when things reach an extreme, they will inevitably reverse. It is in the evolution of this season that new vitality is being conceived. From last autumn to this time, the whole world has been moving towards the light, whether in Europe or the Far East. Therefore, people should only be wary of the disturbances that may occur in the future, but should not be afraid of them, especially since nearly ten years of history have tempered the vast majority of mankind to be wise and strong. If the aggressors do not get the opportunity to strike unexpectedly and attack unprepared, and if they do not use various tricks such as division, temptation, deception, and concealment, the possibility of their success is extremely small, which can be asserted at this moment on the eve of the final reckoning.</p>

However, the conference was adjourned after half an hour without any results. French officials expect the armistice conference to end tomorrow night. Seven Japanese representatives and six French and Thai officials participated in the conference and spoke in Japanese. The French and Thai sides used translators to interpret.

However, fighting continued in various border areas afterwards. West of Sisophon (transliteration), there were still bursts of gunfire two hours after the declared ceasefire time. (United Press telegram of the 29th)</p>
<p>Saigon: The Japanese cruiser "Natori," which was dispatched to settle the Vietnamese conflict, arrived here at 2 p.m. yesterday so that the Thai and Vietnamese representatives could negotiate a ceasefire on the ship. At the same time, although both sides stipulated a temporary ceasefire in the morning, they were still at war. When the "Natori" arrived in Saigon, the Chinese were celebrating the lunar New Year, Chinese national flags were flying everywhere, and firecrackers were bursting. The chief of the Japanese military delegation, Major General Jun Tian, arrived here by plane from Hanoi in the evening, while a Thai plane carrying several Vietnamese and Thai representatives came from Bangkok. The Japanese cruiser was protected by a small destroyer. A large crowd watched the scene. When several Japanese officials and sailors landed, there were many special plainclothes detectives scattered around the streets. It is widely believed that the negotiations will be held on the ship at 3 p.m. today. The Japanese Consul General in Hanoi and several Japanese military attachés in Bangkok have arrived here by plane and will participate in the meeting. A senior French official said that the negotiations will be held twice a day or will continue for two or three days.

<p>Off Cape Jacques: Japanese Warships Gather</p>
<p>Cape Jacques: Officials announced that a Japanese naval unit, including a giant aircraft carrier, was discovered 25 miles off this cape yesterday. The area is very close to Cam Ranh Bay, an important naval port in Annam. The Japanese warships have been stationed off the coast for two days, causing great unease among officials in Saigon. However, the fleet was later seen sailing south. Some people believe that Japan will propose to manage the world-class naval base in Cam Ranh Bay as a reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese war. Although mediation has been proposed, border fighting continued yesterday. The French issued an official report stating that French planes made retaliatory bombing raids on several cities in Thai territory on Saturday night, and there was also sporadic fighting and shelling along the Mekong River.

(28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning's editorials in various newspapers unanimously and enthusiastically supported Chairman Chiang's report on the New Fourth Army incident. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - At the National Government's Commemoration Week session on the 27th, Chairman Chiang's address stated, "Today is already January 27th, and the first month of the 30th year is about to pass. In these remaining five days, all of us comrades in the Party, government, and military, no matter how busy we are, should thoroughly review the work of the past year and report it as scheduled. Moreover, the plans and procedures for the work of the coming year should be specifically determined and vigorously promoted so that the work we do this year will be more advanced and more successful than last year. Everyone should know that as we fight this year, we have reached a crucial juncture for final victory. Therefore, we must be extra cautious and strive hard to promote the success of the war and national construction. Only in this way will we not delay and fail, and only then can we repay the generals and soldiers and compatriots who have shed their blood and sacrificed for the country and the nation, and only then can we comfort the spirit of the Premier and the revolutionary martyrs in heaven. As far as our handling of the New Fourth Army incident is concerned, everyone, both Chinese and foreigners, knows that this is entirely our</p>
<p>problem of rectifying military discipline. The nature is very clear, the problem is very simple, and the incident is also very ordinary. Soldiers who violate military discipline must be punished. As for troops that claim to be soldiers, attack friendly forces, occupy defense zones, and hinder warfare, they need to be resolved even more. This is the unchangeable principle of warfare and military governance. From an international perspective, we have been fighting for nearly four years, and friendly countries have always sympathized with and assisted us. They all eagerly hope that our army will have strict discipline and enhanced strength. No friendly country has expressed doubts or hesitations because we do not rectify military discipline and punish soldiers and troops who disobey orders. On the contrary, they only have concern and joy. It is impossible for friendly countries to be swayed by the Japanese people. In the eyes of wise politicians, we can rectify discipline, so that our officials and troops can be more firm and progressive, and there is no one who does not express support, because each friendly country is willing to come to help us fight, hoping that our nation will have the spirit of self-improvement, so we must pay attention to whether our government has the ability to enforce the law and govern the army, if our people only know</p>
<p>resigning to despair, and our soldiers arbitrarily destroy laws and disrupt discipline, disobey orders, and refuse to be transferred, then who would be willing to help this undisciplined army and this spiritless nation, and we ourselves would be even less able to talk about fighting. As far as we are concerned, since the war, there have been more than one instance of punishing cases of disobeying orders and violating military discipline, such as the cases of Han Fuju, Li Fuying, and Shi Yousan. This time, the New Fourth Army was subjected to military law sanctions because it disobeyed orders, attacked friendly forces, and even claimed to be soldiers and disrupted the war. This was purely for the purpose of rectifying military discipline, and there was no other political or party affiliation mixed in, and this is the first point that everyone can understand, and secondly, we only executed the three responsible chief officers of Han Fuju, Li Fuying, Shi Yousan, but why did we cancel his number and disband the troops in this New Fourth Army incident, and I also want to explain this point to you, because at that time Han Fuju, Li Fuying, Shi Yousan were only the chief officers who disobeyed orders, and there was no action of claiming to be soldiers and rebelling</p>
<p>attacking friendly forces, everyone should know that at that time the Central Government ordered Han Fuju to defend Shandong firmly, but he refused to defend Shandong and insisted on retreating to Hanzhong, Shaanxi, to preserve his personal strength. The Central Government ordered Li Fuying to fight on the front line and did not allow him to retreat. He disobeyed the order to advance and insisted on retreating without authorization, risking the joint liability law of the revolutionary army. As for Shi Yousan's execution last year, it was the same. At that time, the General Headquarters ordered him to move to western Henan, but he disobeyed the order and remained in eastern Henan, harassing the local area and extorting the people. However, although these three people disobeyed the order, their troops did not rebel or rebel, so as long as the three of them were subjected to discipline, the officers and soldiers of their troops not only had no need for punishment, but also because the officers and soldiers were able to understand the overall situation and obey the order to reorganize, the government still had to love and preserve them, but the Daoist New Fourth Army case was different from this. Since November of last year, the General Headquarters has repeatedly ordered him to go north and move to the designated area to fight. He insisted on staying put, and when the deadline had passed, he still had the freedom</p>
<p>to move south and take a planned military action, blatantly attacking the 40th Division and Shangguan Yunxiang's General Headquarters, carrying out a rebellion, so we had to enforce military discipline and disband him completely. From this, it can be seen that the case of disbanding the New Fourth Army this time is just an ordinary example of our rectifying military discipline during the war. Moreover, in the past, there were more than a dozen commanders, commanders-in-chief, army commanders, and division commanders who violated orders and discipline and were still under trial in the General Directorate of Military Law Execution, and among them, there were also those who fought very hard and had made considerable achievements, but because they later violated military law, they had to be painfully handed over to military law adjudication. This shows that soldiers and troops who do not obey orders, do not abide by discipline, and do not perform combat missions must be strictly rectified and punished according to the law. For the sake of the life of the entire army, for the survival of the country, and for the victory of the war, we must not be lenient or indulgent. At the same time, we must never wrongly judge the crimes of our subordinates, causing our soldiers to suffer</p>
<p>unjust grievances. However, since last year, cases of the New Fourth Army disobeying orders and violating discipline have emerged one after another. The Central Government has repeatedly been lenient and earnestly exhorted them to awaken. How could they know that they would persist in their evil ways and eventually claim to be soldiers, attack friendly forces, and rebel? Under these circumstances, the Central Government could no longer be tolerant and could no longer fail to impose strict punishment. However, in my personal opinion, I only have sorrow and shame for this incident, because the crimes of my subordinates are the responsibility of me as the commander, and it is also my shame. Therefore, everyone must know that this is not something to be comforted about. This is a page of painful history that is absolutely unavoidable. Although the New Fourth Army incident has been dealt with, and my National Revolutionary Army is still fighting gloriously, it has left a stain after all. As the commander-in-chief, my grief is really above that of anyone else. This is the second point that everyone should clearly recognize. Furthermore, why should we strictly rectify military discipline? Because military discipline is the place where the orders of the army lie, and it is also where the life of the country and the nation rests. The success or failure of our war depends on whether our army can</p>
<p>enforce discipline, and this time, the New Fourth Army openly claimed to be soldiers and disobeyed orders, destroying military discipline. Whether our government can thoroughly enforce discipline is the biggest key to whether our country can survive. Therefore, I am determined this time to strictly enforce military discipline in order to save the army from danger, ensure the victory of the war, and safeguard the survival of the country. On the other hand, if we cannot rectify military discipline this time and appoint troops and soldiers to violate orders and destroy discipline, then the army will fail and the country will perish. Moreover, the country has entrusted me with the responsibility of commander-in-chief. If I, the commander-in-chief, try to seek temporary peace and security and indulge evil people, putting the entire army in danger, I will not only fail to fulfill my duties, but also fail to live up to the expectations of our entire army and the comrades who have already sacrificed for the war. And strictly speaking, this is tantamount to me, the commander-in-chief, condoning the troops of my subordinates to violate laws and disrupt discipline, causing them to fall into the path of destruction and suicide. This is the greatest sin of me, the commander-in-chief. Therefore, I would rather disregard all sacrifices and must thoroughly enforce discipline. All generals of the National Revolutionary Army must understand that military discipline is more important than everything else, and military discipline</p>
<p>is equally equal. There must be no favoritism or injustice. We must not place military discipline out of consideration because of indulgence towards a few people, resulting in the failure of the war and the destruction of the country. This is the third point that everyone must recognize. Recalling the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, at the beginning of the war, several friends advised me, "Now our country's unity is not yet stable, our preparations are not yet sufficient, and the international environment is even worse. Many people are asking the government to fight on the surface, but they may not be sincere in reality, so we cannot fight against Japan. Otherwise, it will be dangerous and we will be afraid of failure." I replied to them at that time, "You cannot view the big issue of war in this way. You must see that our government now is a revolutionary government, our army is a revolutionary army, and the strength of our country and army is not simply relying on weapons and equipment to compete with the Japanese. We cannot worry about the national difficulties that may arise after the war. If we do not do so,</p>
<p>the spirit of the army will be completely lost, so in order to increase the strength of resistance, unite the spirit of friendly forces, and seek final victory, we must strictly punish the rebellion of the New Fourth Army this time to maintain the discipline of our resistance and national construction revolution." Speaking of this, everyone can get a clear concept, that is, the handling of the New Fourth Army incident is originally a very ordinary and very common thing, and it is also a necessary measure in our resistance and national construction governance. All the propaganda and malicious speculations, and even the rumors that attempt to sensationalize international public opinion, I dare say are entirely the work of the Japanese. And I believe that any of our people who are wholeheartedly engaged in resistance and national construction will not only not listen to rumors, but also not follow suit and think that it is a terrible thing. The government did not announce the crimes committed by the New Fourth Army in Jiangbei and Jiangnan in the past, which was to protect you, not to condone you. You have committed the serious crime of attacking friendly forces and slandering the government, sacrificing your international status. This kind of behavior, this kind of attempt, is exactly what the Japanese are seeking. This will not only not cover up your own crimes, but will also be spurned by the military and civilians of the whole country who are engaged in arduous resistance and national construction, and you will have no room to stand. If we truly love the country, we must honestly respect the law and be bound by discipline, so that we can benefit the resistance and national construction. Only then can we be Chinese citizens.

<p>Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Halifax met with Assistant Secretary of State Welles for an hour yesterday. He told the newly opened reporter that he would soon discuss the issue of exports to the Soviet Union with the State Department, because Britain believes that exports to the Soviet Union will allow the Soviet Union to replenish its exports to Germany. A large amount of American goods have now been shipped to the Soviet Union, and more will be shipped in the future, and goods from Latin American countries are also being shipped to the Soviet Union.

<p>London - Officials said yesterday that the British government has protested to Washington and Moscow, accusing the United States of indirectly aiding Germany by shipping goods to the Soviet Union. Economic Warfare Minister Dalton said in the House of Commons that the goods the United States exports to the Soviet Union are directly aiding Germany. Although there is no evidence, the goods the Soviet Union exports to Germany have replaced the goods from the United States. He also said that there are as many as 1,940 tons of cotton currently being shipped from the Soviet Union to Germany. The amount of brass shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union has increased from a very small amount to 57,000 tons.

<p>London - The British King has issued an order that all men in the country who are not yet 41 years old or have reached 28 years old today will be called up for registration for military service. According to the men born from 1904 to 1920, they have already been registered for military service. This new order expands the above-mentioned military service age, on the one hand, including the two grades of 1921 and 1922, and on the other hand, including the three grades of 1903, 1902, and 1901, and those of the 1900 grade who are not yet 41 years old. At the same time as the registration matters are handled, the existing reservation system will be revised. Regarding the registration of 19-year-old men, a method has been agreed upon to protect the creation of certain scientific and technical talents so that they can undertake major national work. The University Joint Recruitment Committee has the right to recommend postponing the call-up of men studying at universities. This method will soon be extended to those who are currently engaged in scientific and technical research in middle schools and are about to enter universities. In addition, the retention of all medical and dental students is also under consideration. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London - American commentator Arglonski, broadcasting from Ankara for the American Broadcasting Corporation yesterday, said that according to reliable diplomatic sources in Ankara, German troops and artillery are currently passing through the Brenner Pass and entering Italy in an endless stream. The German and Italian general staffs are holding important staff talks in Rome. The Fascists are quite surprised by the public condemnation of the government by the people, and they are not without doubts about the loyalty of the people in supporting the Italian army. People in the industrial areas of northern Italy are openly discussing the government's mistakes in public places. Demonstrations have occurred several times in the streets of Rome to oppose German soldiers wearing military uniforms. Italian foreign ministry officials have recently disappeared suddenly. It is found that these people come from aristocratic and military families and are suspected of having little sympathy for the Fascist regime. After being invited by foreign diplomats, they left and never returned. When asked about their whereabouts, the respondents always said that they had left suddenly and did not know where they had gone. The aristocratic class in Italy is increasingly advocating the restoration of the Italian monarchy and the overthrow of the Fascist Party. Mussolini is deeply afraid that the power of the aristocracy will affect the Italian army, so he urgently asked German troops to enter Italy. However, it is too optimistic to expect a real anti-Fascist rebellion to occur in Italy at the moment. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Ankara Radio broadcast last night that because the Italian army suffered losses on various fronts, German troops have been arriving in Italy in an endless stream. German staff officers have also been sent to the Italian army's general headquarters to cooperate with Italian officers in the hope of preventing the Italian army from collapsing again. It is reported that the German troops entering Italy are not only stationed in northern Italy, but also moving towards southern Italy. (27th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Southern Capital City - It has recently been rumored that riots have occurred in Milan and Turin, Italy. According to people from Italy, demonstrations have also occurred in Trieste, Italy. The demonstrators shouted slogans demanding peace and condemned the Fascist regime and Germany. The Fascists had to open fire to suppress the demonstrations, and several people were killed or injured. It is said that similar demonstrations have occurred in many small towns in the Po River Basin. Although the Fascist Party and the secret police in the area have taken repressive measures, the people are still trying to express their dissatisfaction. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - A New York Times reporter in the Southern Capital City quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the secret police of Italy and Germany have arrested twenty or thirty Italian army officers and Fascist personnel in Milan and Turin. According to border sources, the disturbances in Milan and Turin are spreading, and other industrial cities are also affected. A Columbia Broadcasting Corporation reporter in the Southern Capital City also reported the same news, saying that Italian soldiers have joined the rebels to fight. However, the above-mentioned news has not yet been confirmed in London. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian government today denied the rumors of riots in Milan and Turin. It also said that foreign reports that German troops are entering northern Italy in an endless stream to quell the riots against Italy's participation in the war are inaccurate. Senior Italian officials said that the only military force of the German army stationed in Italy is the air force, which is cooperating with the Italian air force in the Mediterranean. Not only were there no riots in Milan and Turin last week, but there have been no demonstrations since the start of the war. (27th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>London - According to Ankara Radio last night, General Graziani, the former Governor of Abyssinia and the current Governor of Libya and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, has been dismissed and replaced by General Bardi, who became famous in the Abyssinian War. The radio station did not announce the reasons for this decision, but foreign sources believe that it is due to the defeat of the Italian army in Africa. (28th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has now also assumed the position of commander of the bomber squadron, with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the air force. He has now left here to go to the front line to fight. During the Abyssinian War, Ciano also served as the commander of the bomber squadron, directing operations. (29th Haitian Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - According to news this morning, in addition to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's appointment as commander of the bomber squadron, Minister of Education Botti (one of the founders of Fascism) and Minister of Public Works Gorla have also assumed military positions, serving as battlefield commanders of the Alpine Army. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - The departure of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the second most powerful figure in Italy, from Rome to the front line has caused two kinds of speculation around the world. It is generally expected that Mussolini's sending his son-in-law to the front line can boost the morale of the Italian army. Otherwise, there will be a major change in the policy that Italy has followed in the past five years. According to government announcements, Ciano's "going to the front line" is to serve as the commander of the bomber squadron, but it has not been announced whether Ciano is going to Africa or Albania. Political observers here point out that Ciano is often considered to be a figure who advocates maintaining the closest friendship between Germany and Italy. Most of the agreements signed between Germany and Italy recently were made after Ciano met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. After Ciano leaves Rome, it will be easier for Prime Minister Mussolini to break away from Germany's friendship and withdraw from the war. Observers strongly argue that this speculation is purely speculative, but it is generally believed that there will be such developments in the near future. According to confidential information obtained here, the internal and military situation in Italy is actually worse than the military setbacks and the news of rebellions in major cities. It is also pointed out that a month ago, the US government's secret envoy in Rome sent a secret message to the State Department. This message made a senior US government official say that "any event is possible" in Italy. Since then, the Italian army has suffered greater setbacks and has been pushed back to the last line of defense in Libya. (29th International News Service Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Amidst Repeated Victories in the War Against Italy: Death of Greek Premier Metaxas; The Nation Mourns the Loss of a Leader; Premier's Position Succeeded by Koryzis <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Athens - Greek Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army, General Metaxas, passed away this morning at 6:30 AM due to complications following throat surgery, at the age of 69. His position as Prime Minister has been succeeded by Mr. Koryzis, the former governor of the National Bank of Greece. As Greek soldiers continue to advance on the front lines, the people of the nation are mourning this devastating news. Military observers say that Greece's victory is attributed to General Metaxas and his Chief of Staff, Papagos. Metaxas studied German military tactics, while Papagos researched under the guidance of several renowned French military officers. These two generals fought together against Turkey in 1897 and in the previous European war. After Metaxas became Prime Minister in 1936, Metaxas and Papagos planned the "Metaxas Line" to protect Greece where it borders Bulgaria and Turkey. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London - News of the death of Greek Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief Metaxas has been received by the British Minister in Athens. This unexpected news has increased the sympathy of the British people for the Greeks' loss of their leader. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Athens - Since the "bloodless coup" of August 5, 1936, Metaxas had effectively become the dictator of Greece. At that time, because the communists had gained an advantage in parliament, Metaxas believed that the parliamentary system was no longer applicable. He ordered the dissolution of parliament, declared martial law nationwide, secretly arrested several opposition leaders, and implemented a strict censorship system. Metaxas then assumed the position of Prime Minister and headed the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Navy, Army, and Air Force. He promised that new elections would be held once the situation stabilized, but one month later (September 7th), Metaxas declared again that for the sake of Greece's interests, parliamentary rule had come to an end, and said that King George II of Greece trusted the government and approved all the measures he proposed. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">A Brief Biography of Metaxas <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>General Metaxas was born in Cephalonia in 1871. He studied at the Athens Military Academy and, upon graduation, was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He went to Germany to study military affairs. After returning to Greece, he was appointed as an adjutant to Venizelos and participated in the Balkan Wars. In 1913, he went to London with his superior to participate in peace talks. However, two years later, he had disagreements with Venizelos and became a royalist. In the same year, he was appointed as Chief of Staff to King Constantine of Greece, but he soon resigned due to disagreements with Venizelos over the issue of whether Greece should join the Allied Powers. In 1917, because Metaxas organized pro-German reservists, he was exiled to Corsica by the Allied Powers, but he escaped, first to Sardinia, then to Rome. It wasn't until 1920 that he was allowed to return to Greece. In the general election that year, Metaxas had conflicts with the King and the Prime Minister, and was promoted to general and placed in retirement. Metaxas then formed the Free Opinion Party, with himself as the leader, and collaborated with Kotzias to engage in restoration activities. In 1923, when the plot failed, he fled abroad. Because he was hiding in a Newfoundland freighter carrying salted cod when he fled, he earned the nickname "Codfish". In 1932, he was allowed to return to the country after a general amnesty and reorganized his political party. In the 1933 general election, he won 46 seats. In the spring of 1935, disturbances broke out, and Metaxas came out to serve the government, serving as a minister without portfolio. To the extent of his powers, he advocated the use of extreme measures to suppress the rebellion, but he resigned in less than two weeks. After King George II of Greece was restored to the throne, because Metaxas had long been the leader of the United Royalist Party, he was appointed Minister of War and Deputy Prime Minister. In 1936, Prime Minister Demertzis passed away, and Metaxas succeeded him, and within four months he carried out his "coup". In the summer of the same year, when King Edward VIII of England toured the Mediterranean, Metaxas was invited for a two-hour conversation. After Metaxas implemented the dictatorial system, he worked hard to reform domestic affairs (paying attention to the revitalization of commerce and education) reorganizing national defense, and reorganizing the military. In 1936, he began the border defense plan, which was completed in December 1939, namely the famous "Metaxas Line." Metaxas's foreign policy was to promote friendship with Turkey, consolidate the Balkan alliance, and improve relations with Italy. Metaxas insisted that national territory, sovereignty, and independence could not be abandoned. In November 1938, he declared that Greece did not demand anything from any country, and would consider any other country's demands on Greek territory as an act of hostility. In February 1940, the Balkan Alliance Conference decided to extend the public affairs between Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia for seven years from 1941, and declared its determination to remain neutral in the European war. Metaxas's strong attitude and competent talents quickly won the support of the people of the country. Metaxas usually disliked wearing uniforms. He admitted that although he was a dictator, he was civilian in nature. It is said that the felt hat he wore has not been replaced in thirteen years. Metaxas's daily attire is neat, he always carries a cane, and he likes to smoke Greek-made cigarettes. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

Well-informed sources here believe that since the U.S. is doing its best to assist Britain, any assistance it provides to China in the near future, in terms of moral support, will be far greater than actual military supplies. Moreover, most people unanimously believe that the U.S. Far East policy will continue to firmly maintain the status quo, with the status quo of the Dutch East Indies as the guideline. Maintaining the status quo of Vietnam and providing aid to China are also what the U.S. will continue to do. Far East affairs experts believe that the current situation has entered an expanded and extremely volatile stage, which will change with the situation in the world. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to diplomatic sources, Roosevelt's advisor Currie is coming to China in the name of a personal representative of the president. Yesterday, he and Dupree, director of the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank, took a clipper from San Francisco westward and will arrive in Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month, and fly to Chongqing the next day. There is much speculation in all circles about the purpose of this trip, but semi-official sources say that Currie will discuss wartime economic issues with the Chinese government authorities. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News recently published a news item about President Roosevelt's advisor Currie visiting China, stating that all parties here attach great importance to it and express their welcome. It is generally believed that Currie's visit to China will further enhance the friendly relations between China and the United States. Various non-governmental diplomatic groups, such as the National Diplomacy Association, the Sino-American Association, and the League of Nations Association, are preparing to welcome him at that time. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned yesterday that President Roosevelt's advisor, Mr. Currie, has obtained a leave of absence to visit Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek abroad and directly investigate China's economic situation. Mr. Currie is a director of the Research and Statistics Office under the Federal Reserve System. He will go to Chongqing at the invitation of the Chinese government. He will also convey President Roosevelt's personal greetings to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It is learned that the economic expert will depart from San Francisco by clipper on Tuesday and is expected to return to the country on March 1. Accompanying him will be Mr. Dexter White, a senior economic officer in the Research and Statistics Office. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding President Roosevelt's administrative advisor Currie going to China to meet with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and investigate China's economic situation, President Roosevelt declined to comment, only saying, "The press already knows about this fact." (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan and Secretary of State under President Hoover, Mr. Castle, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that if the U.S. had adopted a firm stance at the beginning of the war in the Far East, it would have avoided unlimited disputes. He also said that Japan is the most advanced country in the Far East and seems to be the most suitable to dominate the Far East. If the U.S. had adopted a firm stance at that time, it would have guided Japan onto the right track. He said that he does not believe that Japan wants to go to war with the U.S., but he also said that if Japan and the U.S. go to war, the Philippines may suffer losses. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>New York - Soong Tzu-wen stated here today at the China Institute that China is one of the allied nations of the United States and is now guarding your fortress in the Pacific. He said that China is conducting a long-term and attrition war against Japan, killing more than one million Japanese soldiers and containing their 1.25 million troops, preventing them from using them to assist their allied countries of Germany and Italy. China's operations have value for democracy and will continue to do so. If peace is negotiated now, it will only be a temporary truce and will be completely beneficial to Japan, because the Sino-Japanese war is originally part of a general war. Only when world affairs achieve a general solution can permanent peace be achieved. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - Mr. Lin, a correspondent for the Central News Agency of China in London, spoke at a banquet of the Aid China Committee yesterday, discussing Japan's objectives in the Pacific and demonstrating how Japan, with its position in Vietnam, Hainan Island, the Ogasawara, Caroline, and Marshall Islands, is disrupting the British defense line between Singapore and Australia. He said that Japan is now planning to interfere in the undeclared war between Thailand and Vietnam, aiming to encompass the entire Vietnam, and then expand its control over Vietnam, including the Kra Isthmus. Another thing that must be remembered is that the Philippine Islands will gain full independence in 1945, and the Japanese have been operating for many years to establish a controlling force in the Philippines. The ultimate fate of the Pacific is tied to Britain's victory over Germany, but the Dutch East Indies and China are Britain's first line of defense in the Far East, so Britain should do everything it can to help China. There are still some people in Britain who harbor the illusion that the Sino-Japanese war can be resolved through compromise. It must be known that compromise is only a temporary peace. The Chinese people are now fighting for the fundamental principles of justice and fairness and will never surrender. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Maintaining Far Eastern Interests: American Policy Unchanged; Japan Merely a Newcomer, Has No Right to Control the Western Pacific <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Well-informed political observers believe that America's policies towards Japan and Britain will not change due to declarations such as those made in Tokyo by Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. They point out that officials here do not attach importance to Matsuoka's remarks to the parliamentary budget committee. American policy towards Britain and Japan was demarcated with the establishment of the military alliance between Japan and the Axis powers, so there is little possibility of changing this policy. Washington officials have long been aware of Japan's slogan of grasping authority in the Western Pacific. However, they believe that Japan has no right, historically or practically, to rule such a vast area. Local officials have privately stated that Japan's slogan is purely aimed at acquiring hegemony by force, and that the United States will certainly not recognize Japan's position. Washington officials also pointed out privately that the United States is the first and largest modernized naval and commercial nation to open the Far East, including Japan, while Japan is only a newcomer. Therefore, the country has no right to rule the entire Western Pacific. Furthermore, they solemnly pointed out that historically and legally, the United States has territorial and commercial interests in the Far East, and will never recognize changes in the Far Eastern "status quo" if such changes are based on Japanese hegemony.

<p>Japanese Ambassador Nomura Departs for the United States to Assume New Post</p>
<p>Tokyo - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, departed for the United States today. It is reported that Nomura carries the following three principles: (1) Japanese diplomacy will center on the alliance concluded by the three Axis powers; (2) Japanese diplomacy will insist on recognizing Japan as an element of stability in the Far East; (3) Japan is very willing to improve Japanese-American relations to the greatest extent possible without violating the above two principles. American Ambassador to Japan Grew and all the officials of the American Embassy wore morning dress to send him off at Tokyo Station. Ambassador Grew personally accompanied Nomura to Yokohama to board the ship. The ship set sail this afternoon. Hundreds of government officials and community leaders came to Tokyo Station to bid farewell to Nomura. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - It is reported that Secretary of State Hull stated during a closed-door meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday to study the aid to Britain bill that long-term efforts to seek mutual understanding and cooperation between the United States and Japan have ultimately failed. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - It is reported that Hull told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that Japan's Greater East Asia New Order seeks to establish a great empire with one billion people, which will greatly threaten American interests in the Far East. This statement was leaked by a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. It was also said that Hull stated that the United States feels great danger on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, so it must vigorously assist China, Britain, and Greece. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, answering questions at a meeting of the House Budget Committee yesterday, said that if the United States insists that its policy towards China is the first line of defense in the Pacific, the development of friendly relations between the United States and Japan will become a dream. The United States now seems to include Australia and New Zealand in its defense system, which is a violation of the Monroe Doctrine. Japan must control the Western Pacific, and the United States must recognize this. Matsuoka also said that Hull's claim that the Axis powers are inclined to limited conquest is inaccurate. Japan, Germany, and Italy have no such tendency and are jointly building a new order and striving to create a more just world. Today, all newspapers here published the above-mentioned remarks of the Foreign Minister in the most important position. The Japan News devoted three-quarters of its front page to a detailed account. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Remarks Cannot Conceal Aggression</p>
<p>Washington - The remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on Sunday at a meeting of the House Budget Committee in response to questions have aroused astonishment among people here, who believe that at a time when Japanese-American relations are unfortunately tense, the Japanese Foreign Minister actually rebuked US Secretary of State Hull and accused Hull of making statements that turn right and wrong upside down, showing that Japan only wants to make relations between the two countries even more tense. Matsuoka's remarks are naturally answered by Asian facts and do not need to be refuted by the United States. Regardless of what Matsuoka says to the parliament, historical facts are there, and it is impossible to conceal Japan's aggression against China in the past ten years, with the seizure of its three northeastern provinces as the first step. The events that have occurred in China in the past three and a half years can prove the falsity of Matsuoka's statement that "Japan is not interested in conquest, aggression, or development." If Matsuoka's terms "conquest, aggression, and development" include Japan's policy in Asia since 1931, the Washington Star's commentary on Nomura's visit to the United States stated that what can make the United States believe that Japan wants to gain its goodwill is action, not empty words. The United States fundamentally opposes Japan's ambition to rule the Far East, and Japan has not been unaware of this. However, the Japanese rulers still openly use the German-Italian-Japanese alliance as a tool to threaten the security of the United States and proclaim that if the United States intervenes in the European war, it will conflict with Japan. If Nomura fully understands the fundamental causes in Japanese-American relations, then he should deal with his work in a realistic spirit and make Japan know what can truly gain the friendship of the American people. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ta Kung Pao stated that the main purpose of the Japanese Foreign Minister's remarks in parliament is to state Japan's right to rule the western Pacific. Matsuoka's remarks about the Tripartite Pact have indicated the possibility of Japan's participation in the European war. Since Japanese newspapers are now chanting the tune of war preparations against the United States, Britain, the United States, and China cannot but adopt necessary plans to cope with the emergency.

<h3 id="e38">Matsuoka's Speech <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka declared today that the fate of world culture depends entirely on the attitude of the United States. "We must make the United States reconsider its attitude." Matsuoka also accused the United States of abandoning the Monroe Doctrine and extending its defense line to the western Pacific. Matsuoka made these remarks in response to questions raised by Congressman Tsuboi at the Lower House Budget Committee regarding President Roosevelt's remarks and Hull's recent speech. Although today is Sunday, the Lower House convened a meeting. The Japanese Foreign Minister accused the United States' defense line of extending not only from the eastern Pacific to the Pacific but also including Australia and New Zealand. Matsuoka said, "It is absurd for the United States to oppose Japan's control of the Western Pacific. We must control the Western Pacific. We must make the United States reconsider its attitude, not only for Japan's sake but also for the sake of the whole world. If this cannot be done, then we can hardly hope for the improvement of Japanese-American relations. The fate of world culture now depends entirely on the attitude of the United States. I am now doing my best to hope that the United States will reconsider its attitude. I want the United States to understand that this cannot be achieved by flattery." Matsuoka then refuted Hull's statement that the Manchurian Incident was the first step in destroying world peace, saying that the Manchurian Incident was the first step from building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to building world culture. The American authorities have failed to understand this point (Co-Prosperity Sphere). It must be known that we can never change our national policy to follow American views. Twenty years ago, only a few dozen Americans said that China was America's first line of defense, but this concept gradually developed, and the influential class of that country held this view. The United States' current assistance to Chongqing is the result of this mentality. To be honest, sincere cooperation between China and Japan does not hinder the United States. However, the basic policy of the United States is to limit Japan's handling of Chinese affairs. Even if Japan respects American rights and interests in China or withdraws Japanese troops from China, the United States may not be able to change its policy. Matsuoka continued, "Japan's path is to deal with this situation with the strongest determination." He said that the Saxon countries are very eager to maintain the status quo in East Asia, but this maintenance of the status quo is actually unfavorable to Japan. Japan is certainly not afraid to change it. When China wanted to destroy Japan's interests in Manchuria and Mongolia, which Japan had established for its national survival, the Saxons were very happy to give China encouragement. As a result, China gradually became proud, and the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War occurred. In response to other questions, Matsuoka admitted that Japan was somewhat apprehensive about the Tripartite Pact among Japan, Germany, and Italy. In response to a question regarding the application of Article 3 of the agreement (which stipulates that if one country is attacked by a third country that is not currently at war, the other signatories should provide assistance), Matsuoka declared that it is not easy to distinguish an aggressor, but that the clause will be invoked unless Germany attacks the Americas. He said, "Japan does not want to shirk responsibility." Interior Minister Hiranuma said that domestic criticism of the Tripartite Pact will be prohibited. Matsuoka also said that the Soviet government has clearly decided to adjust its relations with Japan, and the recent conclusion of the temporary fisheries agreement is a clear indication of this. Therefore, he believes that the two countries have a great hope of repairing their old friendship. The Army and Navy Ministers said in response to questions that although the war against China is ongoing, the national defense forces have made full preparations to cope with emergencies. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, in response to a question at a budget committee of the Lower House, said that Japan will never tolerate interference by a third country that attempts to prevent Japan from expanding its power to the South. Regardless of whether other countries recognize it or not, Japan is qualified to demand dominance in East Asia. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">US Treasury Secretary Urges Congress to Quickly Pass the Lend-Lease Bill; Hull Says Aid to Britain Will Not Lead the US into War <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that if Congress does not pass the Lend-Lease Act, the wars of China, Britain, and Greece will be greatly affected. The bill is aimed at the fact that these three countries do not have sufficient financial resources to continue purchasing raw materials from the United States. He said, "Congress should seriously consider whether we need China, Britain, and Greece to continue fighting. I believe that if Congress does not pass this bill, Britain will only have the path of stopping the war. The decision on this matter is in your hands." He also said that National Defense Committee Chairman Knudsen is now trying to allow Britain to order another batch of 2,000 military aircraft from the United States, but Britain does not have the huge amount of money to buy them. The Treasury Secretary said in response to questions that he does not hope that Britain will repay the US$5,729,000,000 in war debts, so the Treasury Department is planning to permanently cancel the debt. He said, "In spirit, I have already canceled this war debt." He also announced for the first time that the French funds that have been frozen by the US government are worth US$1,593,000,000. He also said that Britain is currently lacking sufficient money. He said that Britain's war costs more than 12,000,000 pounds per day, which accounts for nearly 60% of its national tax revenue and is "constantly increasing." He also submitted to the Senate the British funds form that he had previously submitted to the House. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington - It is reported that Secretary of State Hull stated during a closed-door meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday to study the aid to Britain bill that the United States' aid to Britain will not lead the United States into war. Britain's resistance to aggression in the past seven months has largely been due to American aid. The Foreign Affairs Committee learned that the State Department obviously had intelligence of Germany's original plan to invade Britain in September last year, but it is not known why it was never realized. It was also reported that Hull stated that he believed that Turkey was firmly opposed to the Axis powers' aggression, but that Japan undoubtedly aimed to seize control of Vietnam.

<h3 id="e44">Special Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers Rescheduled; To Be Held Again on the 5th of Next Month at the Original Location; General Director Keh Chieh-wei and Others Will Still Attend <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Commercial Bureau’s Board of Directors’s awarded additional donation case, the special conference for foreign taxpayers convened on the 23rd of this month by the Head Consul Mr. Hill was delayed because the meeting was interrupted by the President of the Japanese Taxpayer Association Mr. Lin Xiongji’s shooting of General Director of the Commerce Bureau Mr. Keh Chieh-wei. After one week, the Commerce Bureau announced that Head Consul Hill has issued a notification stating that the meeting is rescheduled for January 5th (Tuesday) at 2:30pm, at the original site, the Racecourse Public Stand.</p>
<p>The meeting agenda has no change.</p>
<p>As for the program for the reopening of the next conference, it remains the same as before, but it will start from where it was interrupted at the last meeting, and the various items that have been discussed will not be repeated. According to the program of the meeting on the 23rd of this month, Head Consul Hill first declared that he would serve as the chairman of the meeting in accordance with Article 15 of the Land Charter, and Mr. Nasi, the assistant of the Commercial Bureau, was elected as the secretary of the meeting. Then, General Director of the Commercial Bureau, Mr. Keh Chieh-wei, proposed and Deputy General Director, Mr. Kana, seconded that the Commercial Bureau increase the total municipal donation, land donation, and surtax by 40% from January of this year until the next annual meeting of foreign taxpayers. After Mr. Keh stated the reasons, Mr. Lin Xiongji, the president of the Japanese Taxpayer Association, took the stage to propose an amendment, expressing his opposition. After that, Chairman Hill submitted the amendment proposed by Mr. Lin to the meeting for a vote. When the supporting and opposing parties raised their hands one after another, Mr. Lin Xiongji slowly stepped onto the stage, and the shooting occurred. The order was greatly disturbed, and the meeting was interrupted. When the next conference reopens, the agenda will continue from here. A certain staff member of the Commercial Bureau stated yesterday morning that it is not certain whether the amendment proposed by the Japanese taxpayers will be voted on again at the conference on February 5th, but the General Director of the Commercial Bureau will not make any further speeches on the proposed additional donation case or the amendment proposed by the Japanese. (At the last conference, after Mr. Lin Xiongji proposed the amendment, Mr. Keh Chieh-wei immediately gave a strong rebuttal.)</p>
<p>Japanese representatives comfort the General Director.</p>
<p>According to the information office of the Commercial Bureau, yesterday morning, several representatives of the Japanese Residents Group and the Japanese Taxpayer Association, including Mr. Fukuda and Mr. Watanabe, the president and vice president of the Residents Group, visited General Director Keh Chieh-wei at the Commercial Bureau to express their deep regret and sympathy for the shooting that occurred at the last special meeting of foreign taxpayers. After the incident at the last conference, the British Consul General George and the American Consul General Lockhart held an emergency meeting that night to discuss countermeasures and decided that if the Japanese side provided assurances that the same incident would not occur again in the future, the postponed meeting could be reopened. After that, Japanese Consul General Horiuchi made assurances to both the Commercial Bureau and the consular corps that if the meeting was reopened, such incidents would never be repeated. At the same time, Deputy General Director Kana, acting in the name of the General Director, sent a letter to Head Consul Hill requesting that the special meeting be reconvened. The public believes that the decision to reopen the conference on February 5th was made by the consular corps at an official meeting after the Japanese side provided assurances and Kana made a formal request.</p>
<p>Intense debate is still expected.</p>
<p>When the next conference reopens, all the foreign directors of the Commercial Bureau will participate together. General Director Zhen Zih-wei has recovered from the wounds on his back and arms and is determined to attend on time. Deputy General Director Kana has resigned, but because he is scheduled to return to the United States on the American mail ship President Cleveland on February 8th, he can still participate and second Mr. Keh's proposal. Other people such as Director and President Fei Li-pu, Assistant Nasi, and Japanese Deputy Director Ikeda will also participate. Nasi will still be the secretary of the meeting, and Ikeda was injured in the hand by a stray bullet during the last incident and was treated at Fu Min Hospital. There should be no problem for him to attend on time. Japanese Director Okamoto will also attend the conference after recovering from his injuries. On the Japanese taxpayer side, because Lin Xiongji is currently detained at the Japanese Consulate Police Station for preliminary questioning, Watanabe, the vice president of the Residents Group, will speak. On the British side, Liddell and Ellington will still propose amendments to the additional donation case, and Liddell and McNesson will propose amendments to the case regarding increasing the photo donation. Therefore, the two amendments were not submitted at the last conference. The public believes that the tension at the reopening of the conference on February 5th will not be less than that of the last conference.</p>
<p>Residents of Hama-kita begin to oppose.</p>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday, the people residing in the area north of the Suzhou River (commonly known as Hongbei) believe that the Commercial Bureau has no appropriate security measures in the area and have now organized groups. If the 41% additional donation case proposed by the Commercial Bureau is passed at the conference on February 5th, they will resolutely oppose it. At the same time, several residents of Hamakita have refused to increase land tax to the landlord. Due to various reasons, the police power of the Commercial Bureau has not been fully implemented in the area north of the Suzhou River, but it is generally hoped that the residents of Hamakita can maintain close cooperation with the police authorities in the most appropriate way to maintain local security. As for the future of this organization of residents of Hamakita to oppose the tax increase, it is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The conference venue has been re-renovated.</p>
<p>The last conference was held in the Jockey Club, which was very well-equipped, but because the conference was disrupted by the incident, the temporary reed sheds were destroyed in many places. Also, the wooden signs in the venue that were used to indicate support or opposition were torn down and broken during the chaos. There were also many damaged light bulbs and chairs. Because the Commercial Bureau’s engineering office reopened the conference at the same location, it has been stepping up repairs in recent days. In addition, in order to prevent accidents from happening again, the police authorities will increase the number of police officers to be on strict guard inside and outside the venue. The area around the podium will also be closely protected, and special attention will be paid to everyone entering the venue.</p>

Patriotic slogans, such as "Support the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction" and "Long Live the Republic of China," are plastered all over the streets, complementing the Spring Festival couplets of various businesses. Citizens throughout the city are actively donating in response to the Spring Festival   Movement. The Spring Festival Labor Movement, as stipulated by the National Comfort General Association, is scheduled to begin on February 10th. Due to Shanghai's unique circumstances, the movement is limited to collecting comfort money, which will be remitted to the national banks for receipt and then directly transferred to the Ministry of Finance for unified distribution. At the same time, various charitable organizations are providing relief to refugees and winter aid to street paupers, activities that are not suspended due to the Spring Festival. Various circles are generously donating their festive New Year's expenses to aid those in need.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Account of the Incident at the First General Meeting <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Chairman's Vote   Proposal Situation</p>
<p>According to reports, at the beginning of the General Meeting last Thursday (the 23rd), the chairman of the meeting, Consul General Sir, asked those who supported the Japanese amendment to raise their hands. Initially, the Japanese taxpayers misunderstood the chairman's intention, assuming that the chairman was asking them to raise their hands in support of a resolution to increase donations. After a while, some gradually understood the chairman's words and raised their hands one after another, until all the Japanese taxpayers present responded. The Japanese taxpayers were all seated together, and their number seemed far fewer than that of the other taxpayers. The chairman then stated that he believed that the number of taxpayers present who had not voted on the Japanese amendment was greater than the number who had already expressed their support.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Suddenly Created   A Clamor</p>
<p>At this point, some taxpayers, both foreign and Japanese, began to shout, opposing this decision.  Some people demanded a "proper vote." The chairman then asked those who opposed the amendment to express their opposition in the normal way, stating that he believed that those who opposed the amendment were more numerous than those who supported it. The president of the Japanese Taxpayers Association, Hayashi Yūki, a short, bald man, had already given a strong speech against increasing donations. Suddenly, he calmly walked onto the stage. At the time, the crowd paid little attention to Hayashi Yūki, as Case, Wei was helping Okamoto instruct the Japanese taxpayers to keep order using the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Hayashi Yūki Suddenly   Pulled Out a Gun and Committed Violence</p>
<p>At the same time, Hayashi had reached the stage and briefly spoke a few words to Ikeda, the Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, who was seated in the back row. As he turned to leave, taxpayers seated on the left side of the grandstand suddenly saw Hayashi Yūki pull out a pistol and shoot Case, Wei in the back. Mr. Case was hit by bullets in two places. Okamoto and Ikeda quickly grabbed Hayashi Yūki, trying to take his gun, causing injuries to their hands. (The three wounded have now fully recovered.)</p>
<p>The Meeting Was Suspended in   Confusion</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese taxpayers completely lost control, throwing chairs, benches, and other objects at the stage. The meeting was then suspended in chaos. Hayashi Yūki was detained at the racecourse and then handed over to the Japanese Consular Police Department, where he remains in custody. Reports in the Japanese newspapers that the Japanese had applied for Hayashi Yūki's bail could not be confirmed as of yesterday morning, as Japanese officials stated that they were unaware of the application. This morning, Japanese newspapers reported that Hayashi Yūki had hired a famous lawyer to appear on his behalf at the preliminary hearing in the Japanese Consular Court in Shanghai. The date of the preliminary hearing is uncertain, but it is widely believed that it will be early next week.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Various Businesses Open on Schedule; Market Stability Remains Constant; Banks Reopen Today, Money Shops Tomorrow; Equalization Committee Resolves to Sustain the Black Market in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>After various businesses completed their year-end summaries for 1940, banks are scheduled to reopen today after the holiday, and money shops are scheduled to open tomorrow. Various businesses are conducting red-hot transactions on schedule, and the overall financial situation remains stable. The commodity markets are relatively stable. However, various illegal speculative venues, due to the abundance of idle capital and the prevalence of speculation, are being strictly suppressed by the authorities, and their scope is gradually narrowing. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, in order to safeguard the trade of various friendly nations with China, has decided to maintain the black market in foreign exchange in Shanghai and strive for sustained stability. Various friendly nations' banks and Chinese banks have uniformly refused foreign exchange arbitrage and forward transactions.</p>
<p>Banks Open for Business; Money Shops List</p>
<p>Member banks of the Bankers Association and the Shanghai Bankers Clearing House, etc., will resume business today after the Spring Festival holiday. The foreign exchange black market, the gold underground market, and the foreign currency market will also reopen at the same time. Member firms of the Money Trade Association, remittance money shops, and the Fu Lu Tai Xi money exchange shops of the Money Exchange Association have decided to list tomorrow after receiving the God of Wealth. Xin Zhong, Yong Long, Qi Chang, Xin He, Yi He, Bao Chang, Shen De, and other seven new limited liability remittance money shops will list for business. The money shop market is scheduled to open tomorrow, only opening for the morning session and temporarily suspending the afternoon session.</p>
<p>1940   Business Overview</p>
<p>Various industries and the banking and money shop industries were able to obtain considerable profits in 1940. Banks engaged in foreign exchange and small money exchange shops, as well as businesses dealing in metals, cotton cloth, foreign and Chinese sundries, grains, and flour, performed best. Next were the silk and satin, northern and southern goods, sugar, yarn, and flower industries. However, firms engaged in speculative activities, due to hoarding and market manipulation, obtained profits far exceeding those of other industries. However, some also failed in their speculation and suffered losses. This improper business practice is prohibited by law and seriously endangers social order and people's livelihoods. It is hoped that speculators will be aware of this. At the same time, it is hoped that Shanghai's idle capital will be quickly transferred to the interior.</p>

<p>Over 200 Japanese Soldiers Killed   Part of the Mercenary Army Surrenders Weapons</p>
<p>According to reliable sources from the Chinese side in Jinshanwei, south of Shanghai, regular Chinese troops are gathering in the western Zhejiang area. After establishing a solid base in Haiyan and Pinghu, the local militia vanguard led by Shen Junsheng's troops, combined with the 30th Division of the regular army, have been advancing rapidly eastward in recent days. The Japanese troops occupying towns from Pinghu to Jinshan have been repeatedly attacked. In the past ten days, more than 200 Japanese soldiers have been killed. As a result, the Japanese troops in the area have retreated to the urban areas and dare not cross the line. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in the Jinshan area has been cut off by the Chinese troops. More than 200 of the "Pacification Army" in Likang, Jinshan, have been disarmed and dealt with by Shen Junsheng's militia. According to local residents, a major counteroffensive by the Chinese troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is imminent in the near future. This is only the prelude to the major counteroffensive.</p>

<p>His Father Was a Famous Missionary in Songjiang   Participated in the Taiping Rebellion</p>
<p>James Burke, son of the famous American missionary Dr. Burke of the American Methodist Church in Songjiang, who previously worked in the press in Litchfield, Connecticut, recently traveled from Hong Kong to Songjiang, passing through Shanghai and staying for a few days. He stated that he intends to complete a biography of his father in the spring. Therefore, he has been collecting materials about his father's life for the past few months in order to start writing. During the Taiping Rebellion, his father was in Shanghai and joined the American Rifle Volunteers, an organization formed by American expatriates. Dr. Burke came to China 53 years ago and is now in Songjiang overseeing the distribution of relief supplies from the American Red Cross. General Frederick Townsend Ward, the American commander of the "Ever Victorious Army" against the Taiping rebels, is buried in Songjiang.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French shipping company's ship, the D'Artagnan, arrived here yesterday (the 28th) carrying 2,000 bags of tribute rice. More grain is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, so rice prices are expected to fall sharply within a few days. The stability of the city's rice market and the downward trend of various rice prices are largely due to the import of foreign rice and the strict controls implemented by the authorities. Responsible individuals predicted yesterday that rice prices would continue to fall when the Lunar New Year comes to an end.</p>
<p>Ships Transporting Rice,   One After Another</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is surging. During the Spring Festival holiday, a total of four French ships arrived in Shanghai, carrying more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice. The Kai Ding (transliteration) ship carried 7,588 bags, the Los ship carried 7,158 bags, the Pujiang Weir ship carried 33,797 bags, and 41,404 bags of popcorn (i.e., pearl rice). The D'Artagnan mail ship carried 63,094 bags. All of the above four ships came directly from Saigon.

<h3 id="e52">Reports of American Sentries Blocking Japanese from Entering Defense Zone; But U.S. Marine Corps Authorities Completely Deny <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>According to Japanese reports, two Japanese teachers attempted to enter the Public Concession and were stopped and searched by two American sentries at the Wuzhen Road Bridge. The two then turned back. The reporter inquired about this matter with the U.S. Marine Corps authorities yesterday, and they considered the report completely unfounded. An official stated that the authorities had summoned all the American soldiers who were on duty at the Wuzhen Road Bridge that day and questioned them. All of them claimed that they had not stopped any Japanese from passing through that area. The Japanese report stated that five Japanese people, two of whom were wearing khaki uniforms, were driving across the bridge when they were stopped and checked by the American soldiers. Although the Japanese explained that they were not wearing military uniforms but civilian clothes, the U.S. Marine soldiers refused to let them enter the Concession. The Japanese Consular authorities were considering lodging a protest over this incident yesterday.</p>
<p>American Authorities   Deny It</p>
<p>The American Evening News reported that Japanese reports claimed that two Japanese teachers attempted to enter the Public Concession and were stopped and searched by U.S. Marine sentries stationed at the Wuzhen Road Bridge. When asked, U.S. Marine officials claimed to know nothing about the incident. The Japanese newspaper claimed that the uniforms worn by the Japanese teachers resembled Japanese military uniforms, and they were therefore mistaken for Japanese soldiers. It was also stated that Japanese soldiers could freely cross the bridge to enter the Public Concession. However, this statement was denied by U.S. Marine officials. The newspaper reported that the Japanese Consul General's office would investigate the case and possibly lodge a protest with the U.S. Marines. However, as of the deadline, Marine headquarters had not received any such protest.</p>

<p>The Public Vies to Read Them   Their Emotions Are Extremely Excited</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. last night, small leaflets of five-colored paper were discovered in the area of the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road. At that time, tourists from various companies were just leaving the theater, and the streets were filled with people. Suddenly seeing these leaflets, the crowd scrambled to pick them up. The reporter also picked up several and saw that they contained sentences that aroused patriotic sentiments, such as "In commemoration of January 28th, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength," "In commemoration of January 28th, we must support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in implementing the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction," and "In commemoration of January 28th, we must practice the National Spiritual Mobilization." The crowd was extremely excited. It was also discovered that the same leaflets were found last night at the Great World, New World, Yu Qiaqing Road's Jue Lu Hotel, Ningxing Street in the French Concession, and East New Bridge. People who saw them praised them and were excited. At the same time, young men and women were also posting patriotic slogans along Lafayette Road and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession.</p>

<p>After the National Comfort General Association launched the Comfort Competition Movement, all parts of the country unanimously responded with the spirit of contributing money where there is money.  It's promoting enthusiastically. The total amount of donations is estimated at 10 million yuan in national currency. It has been decided to use large sums to establish schools for the children of war widows and widowers and to establish productive enterprises for the families of war widows and widowers, so that the great power of the Chinese nation and the foundation for victory and success can be expressed through this great social sympathy. Donations are designated to be collected by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. Although the situation in Shanghai is special, the fundraising work will be carried out diligently in accordance with the methods instructed by the General Association. It is also heard that this fundraising will be carried out by nine groups: Party and Government, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Overseas Chinese, Women, Youth, Transportation, Culture, and Agriculture and Labor. The list of directors and deputy directors of each group is recorded below: (1) Party and Government Group: Director Ye Chuqia, Deputies: Lu Chao, Wei Daoming, Liang Hancao, etc.; (2) Finance Group: Director Xu Qi, Deputies: Zhou Shouliang, Xi Demao, Gu Yiqun, etc.; (3) Industry and Commerce Group: Director Weng Wenhao, Deputies: Liu Hongsheng, Xian Guansheng, Hu Xiyuan, Wu YunChu, etc.; (4) Overseas Chinese Group: Director Chen Shuren, Deputies: Zhou Qigang, Yu Bin; (5) Women's Group: Director Wang Wenxiang, Deputies: Li Dequan, etc.; (6) Youth Group: Director Zhang Zhizhong, Deputies: He Haoruo, etc.; (7) Transportation Group: Director Zhang Jiaao, Deputy: Peng Xuepei; (8) Culture Group: Director Chen Lifu, Deputy: Pan Gongzhan, etc.; (9) Agriculture and Labor Group: Director Hong Lanyou, Deputies: Zhu Xuefan, Lu Jingshi, Bao Guohua, etc.</p>

<p>Due to the shortage of raw materials last year, the flour mills in this city only produced one-tenth of their usual annual output. The profits they deserved were also sacrificed by selling flour at a low price, so the accounts were flat. However, the low-price sales throughout the year were well-received by society and encouraged by the Municipal Council, so they are willing to continue serving the community this year.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Saving Democracy and the Issue of Security <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shih</p>
<p>This is another essay by Mr. Hu Shih. Although it was written on October 24th of last year, everything it says is no different from the current international situation and is continuing to develop. "Saving Democracy" is an old question, and the United States is once again shouldering this responsibility. Indeed, the key to solving this problem is still in the hands of the American people, and President Roosevelt is now making the greatest efforts to implement it. These days are the days when the U.S. Congress is passing the Lend-Lease Act, and we respectfully publish this article with fervent hope.</p>
<p>Three important events occurred within a 24-hour period a week ago: on October 16, the United States implemented an embargo on the export of all grades of scrap iron and steel; on the same day, American youth between the ages of 21 and 35 registered in accordance with the Selective Service Act; and at midnight that day, the famous Burma Road, which had been closed for three months, reopened to transport war materials to China.</p>
<p>These three events occurred on the same day, which may be just a coincidence, but the fact that the three important events occurred almost simultaneously should make us more aware of their significance. What is the significance? It is that the Anglo-Saxon nations have now fully acknowledged and understood that China and the British Empire are on the same side, engaged in the same world war, and that the United States of America, even if it is not militarily involved in this war, is fundamentally affected.</p>
<p>The reason why Britain resolutely disregarded Japan's threats and opened the Burma Road to allow China to transport goods is because of this. The reason why the US government delayed for so long and finally embargoed all grades of scrap iron and steel, and the first decision in the US to select more than one million young people for military training in peacetime, is also because of this.</p>
<p>About four months ago, on July 5, I made the following remarks at the New York World's Fair:</p>
<p>"It is very important, and the world must understand that today there are only two major powers fighting to the death against aggression with force: one is the British Empire, and the other is China. China has been fighting hard for three long years. We are fighting for ourselves, but we are also helping other countries that are engaged in the same war elsewhere. We have prevented one of the most formidable aggressors from assisting its European aggressor and companion."</p>
<p>At that time, many people could not fully appreciate the true meaning of these words. The British government's closure of the Burma Road to China two weeks later certainly did not fully understand that this was an act of persecuting allies and helping the enemy, and political commentators publicly advocated that compromises should be made with Japan so that Britain and the United States could concentrate their forces on handling the European situation.</p>
<p>Who knew that at the end of last month, the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan stipulated that Japan recognized and respected the leading position of Germany and Italy in Europe, and Germany and Italy also recognized and respected the leading position of Japan in the so-called "Greater East Asia." According to Article 3 of the treaty, these three aggressor states "must assist each other with all political, economic and military means if one of the signatory states is attacked by a strong country that is not currently involved in the European War or the Sino-Japanese War." After the Tripartite Pact was signed, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop frankly stated: "Any country that intends to meddle in the final stage of solving these problems in Europe or East Asia, or attacks one of the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact, must face the full concentrated power of these three countries with more than 250 million people."</p>
<p>A few days later, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka also publicly warned the United States:</p>
<p>"If the United States blindly insists on the status quo in the Pacific, then we will fight the United States."</p>
<p>The words of threat in the newly signed Tripartite Pact and after the signing prove to the world that Japan is fighting on the side of Germany and Italy. In fact, since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by the three countries in November 1936, Japan has become an ally of Germany and Italy. The reason why Japan has not been able to give its European allies greater assistance in the European war in recent months is only because Japan has been fighting in China for three years, sinking deeper and deeper, unable to extricate itself. It has lost millions of soldiers and has also consumed a large amount of its long-accumulated military supplies and weapons. Its commerce, export industry, and national finances have been destroyed by the war. Its gold holdings have been almost completely exhausted, and the Japanese navy, second only to the British and American navies, must maintain the smooth flow of its supply routes in order to continue its war in China, which has now expanded to a front line of more than 2,000 miles.</p>
<p>In short, China's three years of fighting have greatly weakened Japan's strength, making it no longer able to effectively assist its European allies or seize the opportunity to plunder during the European war. I believe that this is the great significance of the part of the responsibility that China has assumed in the current global struggle to save democracy, which is enough to be passed down in history.</p>
<p>But our common problem is "saving democracy," which is often threatened by powerful militarist aggressors. The development of modern democratic political systems first occurred in the British Isles, followed by North America. This is not just a historical coincidence. At that time, isolation to avoid militarist aggression was a necessary condition for the gradual development of free democratic systems.</p>
<p>But now the world has been disturbed so narrowly that it can no longer maintain isolation, and the problem of "saving democracy" has become the inseparable problem of saving democracy throughout the world. As long as the lives and freedoms of our people are not safe in this world, the American way of life can no longer rest easy. As long as genuinely civilized, democracy-respecting, and peace-loving people in this world, like the Danes, Norwegians, Dutch, and Belgians, are not safe, then countries like Britain, France, and the United States will also have no security to speak of. The reason why the United States of America is now conscripting young people in peacetime and plans to spend five trillion yuan to strengthen national defense is simply because democracy is not safe anywhere in this world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem of "saving democracy" is the same as the old problem of "making the world safe for democracy."</p>
<p>Twenty-three years ago, the United States fought "to make the world safe for democracy," won the war, but lost the peace. At that time, the United States avoided taking on the great task of establishing a new world order to promote peace and end all wars. The resulting world order had no power to enforce its own decisions and laws. We have witnessed the world order being cruelly persecuted and torn to shreds.</p>
<p>Now we are gathered together again to consider the same old problem of "saving democracy."</p>
<p>The key to solving this problem is still in the hands of the American people. If possible, the United States does not have to get involved in the war, but there are two things that the United States must do. The first is that the United States must provide China and the British Empire with all kinds of effective assistance to win the war. The second is that when the victory is won (I guarantee that it will be won), the United States must actively participate in the creation and maintenance of peace to establish a new international organization, backed by organized and powerful forces, so that democracy can exist safely in this world and mankind can live safely. Without the United States, this task will inevitably fail again.</p>

<p>During the Lunar New Year holiday, our newspaper suspended publication for six days. Within these six days, besides the opening of the Western Ratepayers' Association and the detailed circumstances of the Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Quo Tai-chi being injured in an assassination attempt, which are recorded elsewhere, we hereby supplement the important news as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity Price Increase Implemented</p>
<p>The French tram and electricity company, with the approval of the French Municipal Council, has implemented a third price increase starting from January 25th. Electricity for lighting has increased from 97% to 103%, and electricity for heating and motors has increased from 97% to 140%. Tap water has increased from 30% to 49%. The fares for trams, trolleybuses, and buses will increase by 30% based on the current prices, with a minimum of six cents for first class and five cents for third class. Furthermore, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company in the International Settlement has announced a price increase starting from the first of next month. At that time, the surcharge for electricity for lighting will increase to 180.97%, and the surcharge for ordinary electricity, heating, cooking, and water heating will increase to 276.37%. These new prices have been fully approved by the Public Works Department (工部局). Residents of both settlements express regret that they cannot bear this burden.</p>
<p>Rice Transportation Requires Permits</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement announced: "The Bureau hereby requests that all relevant parties pay attention: Anyone wishing to transport rice out of the International Settlement, whether it is foreign rice or Chinese rice, must, during daily office hours, apply to Room 150, first floor, of the Bureau's General Office at 209 Jiangxi Road to obtain a permit. Rice cannot be transported out of the International Settlement without first obtaining a permit." Rice merchants within the International Settlement have all complied with the order.</p>
<p>Songhu Battle Commemoration</p>
<p>January 28th was the ninth anniversary of the Battle of Songhu. All sectors of Shanghai observed a moment of silence in commemoration. Many citizens voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets to mourn the martyred soldiers. To inherit the legacy of the fallen heroes and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation, their belief in resisting the nation-building strategy is even firmer, and they are intensifying the promotion of thrift, donations, and disaster relief movements to fulfill their responsibilities. The settlement authorities implemented security measures throughout the day.</p>

<p>According to astronomical circles, this September presents the best opportunity to observe a total solar eclipse visible in China. The date of the eclipse is September 21st, and it will be visible in the northeastern part of Fujian province. This is a rare occurrence in decades. Therefore, several astronomers in this city are preparing to form an eclipse observation team to travel there with various instruments for observation. This is indeed a grand event.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Increased Taxes in the French Concession - Chinese Citizens Unable to Bear the Burden - Ratepayers' Association Sends Letter to the French Municipal Council for Consideration - Believes the Impact on Prices is Significant <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The various taxes in the French Concession have been increased since last July, barely half a year ago. It is said that another increase will be implemented starting from January 1941. At a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, taxpayers within the concession will inevitably suffer from the inability to bear the burden. It is reported that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession has now sent a letter to negotiate, requesting serious consideration. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, we have learned that the Board of Directors of the French Municipal Council of Shanghai has decided to implement a comprehensive and substantial increase in various taxes in the French Concession, effective January 1, 1941. Upon hearing this, our association is shocked. Upon investigation, the various taxes in the French Concession have been increased since July of last year, barely half a year ago. In other words, taxes have been increased twice in less than half a year, which is rare according to precedent, which can be described as unprecedented. The proportion of the increase is astonishing. Taking the property tax as an example, on July 1, 1940, the main tax and surtax increased from 17% to 22%, an increase of 5%. This time, it increased from 22% to 30%, an increase of 8%. As for other taxes such as land tax, license fees, and other miscellaneous taxes, all have been greatly increased, with some increases reaching more than double. Looking at the recent rise in prices and the ever-increasing cost of living, citizens in the concession are already struggling to maintain their daily expenses. Therefore, their faces are pale, and there is hunger on the roads. Friends and relatives gather for banquets, citing the difficulty of making a living as a hidden worry. Now, the increase in local taxes will naturally affect prices and inevitably lead to a parallel rise. The so-called "rising tide lifts all boats." Obviously, disregarding social stability is not only making people unable to live, but its impact on the security of the concession is extremely significant. However, on the one hand, they are still diligently trying to suppress prices and crack down on monopolies, which is contrary to their goal and self-contradictory. Furthermore, the total budget expenditure of the Municipal Council for 1940 was slightly over 16.79 million yuan, while in 1941 it is slightly over 33.18 million yuan, an increase of one fold, which can be described as rapid progress. It is our belief that expenditure should be based on income, which is the economic principle that municipal authorities should abide by. Now, due to the huge increase in expenditure, without regard to the living conditions of taxpayers and the ability of taxpayers to afford it, they suddenly implemented another tax increase as a means of making up for the deficit. This practice of measuring expenditure to determine income is not desirable. Our association, being a taxpayers' group, dares to present this humble opinion, etc.</p>

<p>The American Red Cross will further increase its assistance to China in the form of medical supplies. This assistance will be unlimited. According to reliable foreign sources, the American Red Cross authorities believe that the first shipment of medical relief supplies to China has achieved excellent results, especially since the medicines did not suffer any accidents during transport through the Chinese border on the</p>

According to the Shanghai office of the American Red Cross, it is expected that the total amount of medical supplies shipped to China will increase from 300,000 US dollars to one million US dollars. After the first batch of medicines arrived in Rangoon, it is reported that the Chinese authorities have allocated 50 transport vehicles to</p>

<h3 id="e63">Met Bad Friends in Gambling Den - Forged Warehouse Receipts for Fraud - Cheated Out of 100,000 Yuan from Both Sides - Ren Chengrong Sentenced, Hou and Li Xu on the Run <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Ren Chengrong from Wuxi, who opened the Xietai Flour Company at 1253 Route Robert, forged warehouse receipts on January 16th for 3,500 bags of flour, worth over 80,000 yuan, stored in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse of Dafu Foreign Company on Jiangxi Road, for a total of seven sheets. He defrauded the Ruiji Company at 122 North Zhejiang Road, receiving a check for 81,785 yuan from the Fuyuan Money Exchange on Henan Road. The case was reported to the Huizi Police, and Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Inspector Yang discovered Ren Chengrong, along with his wife Zhu, the suspected father-in-law Chen Zhenfu (also known as Zhu Guangrong), and his wife Liu, and confiscated the money Ren had</p>
<p>Exchanged for ten gold bars, 435 US dollars, 803 French francs, 100 Japanese yen, and six bank savings books with fictitious names, totaling over 20,000 yuan. They were brought to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. On the 24th, Judge Jiang Shuzi reviewed the case in the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution for forging documents and fraudulently obtaining property, stating that after investigation, it was determined that the suspect's relatives Chen Zhenfu, his wife Liu, and the company's accountant Yu Zhengchang</p>
<p>Were not involved and requested their release. The court approved the request. It was said that the defendant Ren Chengrong had recently become addicted to gambling, losing a significant amount of money. He met Li Xuchu, who is now on the run, at the gambling venue. After discussion, they jointly established a Tianxing Trading Company on Nanjing Road. The forged warehouse receipts were printed by Li. On the 16th of this month, he also used similar forged warehouse receipts for 500 bags at the Zhongmian Flour Company on Wuxi Road, defrauding them of 15,330 yuan. Afterwards, Li received 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>And fled without a trace. The defendant also intended to take the money and escape back to his hometown of Wuxi, so he booked room 211 at the Jue Lu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. However, due to the sudden urgency of time, he was unable to leave and was arrested. According to the testimony of Liu Kang, manager of the Ruiji Flour Company, the defendant Ren Chengrong often went to the gambling den at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road, where he lost money gambling. Li Xuchu, a gambling friend, devised this fraudulent scheme to defraud the Ruiji and Zhongmian flour companies.</p>
<p>It is true that he defrauded money in room 211 of the Jue Lu Hotel. Li demanded 60,000 yuan at that time. Due to the tense situation, he first gave a savings book for 10,000 yuan and asked him to leave first to escape to another port. Judge Jiang ordered that he and his wife Zhu be returned to custody separately to await sentencing.</p>

<p>He Shen, a widow living at 4, Lane 85, Zhangjiazhai Road, hired Lu Er, from Jiangbei, as her chauffeur for five years. Recently, Lu had malicious intentions and conspired with bandits to rob his employer's property. At around 8:00 AM on the 24th of this month, Lu</p>
<p>Opened the back door, and five bandits followed him in, threatening with guns. However, while they were searching and robbing, someone secretly reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which immediately dispatched Detective Yang Feizhang, Chen Tingjing, and Officer Wang Shidong to surround and arrest them. At that time, the gang of thieves had also discovered it and fled over the roofs, carrying the stolen goods. As a result, bandits Zhang Qin and Zhao Amao were arrested in house number 91, and Wang Linkui was arrested in He Shen's kitchen. Another thief, Lu Shuchang, fled into a woman's bedroom in house number 95. At that time, the woman was still sound asleep and had not gotten up. Lu then slept with her, forcing her to recognize him as her husband, so that if</p>
<p>The detectives came to inquire, she could tell them that he was her husband. After a while, the detectives tracked them down and arrested Lu. Another thief named Hu A escaped. It was found that He Shen's loss of jewelry, silver ingots, and cash amounted to over 10,700 yuan. The detectives recovered most of the original stolen goods, worth over 10,300 yuan, from the thieves' persons. Part of the stolen goods were taken away by Hu A.</p>

<p>Three Thousand People Per Day as the Limit</p>
<p>Some philanthropists in Shanghai, seeing that the price of rice is too expensive and that the poor people in the Southern City lack relief and have difficulty obtaining food, pitifully suffering from hunger and cold, have specially established a temporary Chun Shen porridge factory in the Vulcan Temple in Dadongmen to benefit the poor. It is planned to distribute porridge daily from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, setting a limit of 3,000 people. Its internal equipment is new. Gruel is cooked without a pot stove, but with Soda stoves and steam pipes placed in large wooden barrels. It takes two hours to turn into rice porridge. Each barrel can feed 750 people. Two barrels are cooked at a time. The two batches of four barrels are enough for 3,000 people to drink. Preparations were made until Lunar New Year's Eve of last year, and over 2,500 people registered to eat porridge. Distribution began on that day, and people were only allowed to eat their fill at the factory, and not allowed to take it out. At that time, over 1,500 people ate, and the rest had not arrived. The number would certainly be filled within a few days. Those registered households who still have sick, poor, disabled, and frail elderly and children who cannot conveniently come to the factory, upon verification, are given special certificates, allowing them to take it back. As it is implemented, it is planned to last for about one or two months. A lot of funds are needed. If there are sources for donations, they can be sent to the China Jisheng Association in Gujia Lane, Ningbo Road, British Concession.</p>

<p>Guangdong bananas sold in Shanghai are transported from the place of origin and are green and unripe. They cannot be sold immediately and must be placed for a certain amount of time to allow the peel to turn yellow and ripen before they can be marketed. However, fruit stores are eager to sell them and turn over capital, so they mostly use coal fires</p>
<p>Heating for market. It is unexpected that heating bananas would lead to a tragic death. At the Zhenfeng Fruit Store at No. 95 Bund outside the French Concession, due to the approaching Lunar New Year and the desire to quickly sell goods, they placed a large batch of bananas in an empty room in the store at 4:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, closing the doors and windows tightly, and burning a large number of coal briquette stoves to heat them. At around 6:00 AM, a fellow worker from Guangdong, Deng Zexiang (28 years old), from the store</p>
<p>Went into the room to check. Because the room was small and the fire was fierce, an extremely thick coal gas smell filled the entire room. As soon as Deng entered the room, the coal gas rushed into his nose and mouth, suffocating him and causing him to fall unconscious. Tao Jianggeng, a colleague from Pudong, saw that Deng had been in the room for a long time and had not come out. He became suspicious and called all his colleagues to push open the door and windows and enter the room to see. Deng</p>
<p>Was unconscious on the ground, his breathing had stopped. A car was hired to send him to Renji Hospital, but the poisoning was too deep, and rescue was impossible. He died upon arrival at the hospital. The hospital reported to the police, who dispatched investigators to investigate the cause of the accident and carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home. The next day, Deng Bingxiang, the deceased's brother, claimed the body. The family of the deceased, on the grounds that Zhenfeng Fruit Store used coal fires to heat bananas with negligence in business</p>
<p>Caused death due to negligence in business, and raised a claim with the store. The person in charge of the store, fearing that the matter would escalate, asked someone to communicate with the family of the deceased and bear the costs of the deceased's funeral, clothing, and coffin, and generously compensate his wife and children.

<p>Jewish Man Sues Chi for Infringement of Invention Rights - Court Rules to Reject Plaintiff's Claim</p>
<p>The Kaisiling water heater produced by the Huayi Electrical Company of the Nanjing Road Mainland Shopping Mall is the culmination of many years of careful research by Chi Fusheng, owner of the Chi Fook Kee Electrical Shop on Hankou Road, and is the latest contribution to the electrical industry. The machine is small and exquisite. Tap water instantly turns boiling when it passes through the machine body. The water flow can be freely adjusted in size, and the temperature can be increased or decreased. The switch button is easy to turn on and off. Chi has been engaged in electrical engineering for over 20 years and has invented and created many machine parts. After Chi created the new type of water heater, he entrusted the Lixin Accounting Firm to apply to the Industrial Technology Review Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing for encouragement. The committee has reviewed and approved a new type patent for three years. Therefore, the new type water heater has a wide sales range. Recently, a Jewish man from Dulai, Li Wensi Dan (transliteration), in the name of the legal representative of the Oriental Trading Company, hired lawyer Chen Zhongyin to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, accusing Chi and the Chinese Rubber Wood Company of colluding to steal the secret of his lightning-style water heater, infringing on his invention rights, and requesting compensation for losses of 8,000 yuan. After Chi was accused, he hired lawyers Li Wenjie and Zhou Kun to submit powerful evidence documents such as the patent granted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and detailed the advantages of the Kaisiling water heater, declaring that he had absolutely no act of imitating the plaintiff. The court recently inquired about the case on the basis of the statement by Judge Ni, and yesterday ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.

<p>Stabilizing Teachers' Lives and Fostering Respect for Teachers</p>
<p>(Fenghua News) In order to stabilize the lives of teachers in all schools in the county, thereby promoting teaching efficiency, and to foster a social atmosphere of respect for teachers, the Fenghua County Government, based on Article 2 of the Ministry's Provisional Measures for Local Subsidies for Primary School Teachers' Rice Funds, is promoting a rice-for-tuition system. The Provisional Measures for the Implementation of the Rice-for-Tuition System in Fenghua County have been formulated and circulated to all schools for conscientious implementation. The methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each teacher in each school shall temporarily receive 2.1 dou of rice per month for food, and each semester shall be calculated as five months. The rice needed by all teachers shall be borne equally by the families of all students in the school, but the children of poor families and military dependents may be given appropriate reductions or exemptions. (2) Schools shall collect the rice for tuition themselves, and the collection period and amount shall also be determined by the schools themselves. (3) Within one month after the start of each semester, each school shall determine and announce the amount of rice to be borne by each student, and notify the students' families separately to pay on time. (4) After receiving the school's notice of the amount and date of collection, the students' families shall hand over the rice to their children to bring to the school for payment, and shall not arbitrarily delay or reduce the amount. If they are not from rice-producing towns or the family is indeed unable to pay in rice, they may pay in miscellaneous grains or discounted prices. (5) After receiving the rice for tuition from the students, the school shall issue a receipt, and at the end of the semester, it shall report the actual number collected to the county government for record. (6) Except for full-time teachers, all other voluntary and part-time teachers shall not have the right to receive rice for tuition. (7) The collection of rice for tuition shall be uniformly implemented from the second semester of the 29th year of the Republic (i.e., from February 1941). (8) If the teachers' meals are provided by the school or by the students' families in rotation, there is no need to collect rice for tuition separately. (9) In addition to the school authorities handling the collection of rice for tuition, the school board or the school affairs assistance committee shall also earnestly assist in the implementation. (10) If the implementation of the rice-for-tuition system is hindered, the school board or the school affairs assistance committee shall be responsible for providing the teachers' meals. (11) After the implementation of the rice-for-tuition system, the original tuition fees of the students in each school shall still be paid as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Economic Industry Talk - God of Wealth <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>"Congratulations and may you be prosperous!" This is a customary greeting upon meeting at the start of the New Year. I remember when I was young, upon meeting elders during the New Year, after the usual pleasantries, they would always add, "May the New Year (or 'New Year's Dawn') bring you everything you wish for," as a blessing. If the New Year's Day falls after the Beginning of Spring (Lichun), some would say, "May the New Spring bring you everything you wish for." Merchants, however, say, "Congratulations and may you be prosperous!" or "May the New Year bring profit," because what merchants value most is profit, and they naturally regard "getting rich" as their sole aspiration. Nevertheless, getting rich is indeed what everyone desires, so "Congratulations and may you be prosperous!" is generally the first greeting in society at the start of the New Year. In reality, the meaning of the two characters "ru yi" (如意, "as you wish") is broad; if everything goes as you wish, getting rich is naturally included. To say that only getting rich can bring fulfillment seems to imply that there is nothing else besides wealth that can bring satisfaction. This may be the view of the worldly, but it cannot be regarded as the consensus.</p>
<p>Commercial news is closely related to industry and commerce. What is discussed and recorded daily is nothing more than the market prices of commodities and changes in the situation. After the winter break, the day of welcoming the God of Wealth is a custom in the business and industrial circles, so some say that the newspaper published on this day (the fourth day of the first lunar month) is the "God of Wealth Newspaper."</p>
<p>The reporter and editor of this publication have been doing this for nearly a decade and have never talked about the God of Wealth with readers. Now, taking advantage of the beginning of the Xin Si year, following what the world says, let's talk about the God of Wealth in the God of Wealth Newspaper, based on what we have heard and seen, to wish all readers flourishing fortune!</p>
<p>The God of Wealth is what the world calls the god who manages wealth and treasures. God of Wealth. China has so many gods precisely because the Chinese people believe that there are such things in the human world, and that there are such gods in heaven; there is no difference in principle between heaven and earth. Therefore, what the "Records of the Grand Historian" says about the relationship between celestial constellations and human fortune and misfortune comes from the same source of thought. As for pursuing good fortune and avoiding misfortune, seeking blessings and avoiding disasters, whether people are yellow or white, whether the land is East or West, whether the time is ancient or modern, there is no need to criticize each other. Some seek it from the One God, and some seek it from multiple gods, but the principle is the same. What is being discussed here is not religion, but simply following the occasion; it is not about discussing theocracy in the age of civil rights, but to understand that there is a public psychology behind the formation of folk customs.</p>
<p>Why is he called the God of Wealth? This requires knowing that in the era of bartering in China, silk was one of the mediums of exchange. Although China had coinage early on, silk was used as a tool for exchanging goods until silver gradually became prevalent after the mid-Tang Dynasty and gradually disappeared. Therefore, the two characters "caibo" (財帛, "wealth and silk") are used together as a general term for wealth.</p>
<p>When did the worship of the God of Wealth begin? In general, it has existed since ancient times. For example, worshiping the Kitchen God, the La Sacrifice, and various other sacrificial ceremonies are all about rewarding the gods and praying for blessings! However, the Gods of Wealth worshiped by the public include the God of Bestowing Fortune, the Five-Way God of Wealth, and the so-called Black Tiger Zhao Xuantan, all of whom are Gods of Wealth. The God of Bestowing Fortune wears a "Mian" crown, wears ceremonial robes, and is said to be the Heavenly Official. The name Heavenly Official first appeared in the "Zhou Li" (Rites of Zhou), and in the past, it was often compared to the Minister of Personnel in the Six Ministries. However, this so-called Heavenly Official is the Ziwei Emperor revered by Taoists. Zi</p>
<p>"In the central palace is the North Star, the celestial pole; the brightest of them, Taiyi, always resides there. The three stars beside it are the Three Dukes, or sons. The four stars behind it, the largest star, is the Empress; the remaining three stars are the attendants of the inner palace. The twelve stars surrounding it are the vassals, all called the Purple Palace."</p>
<p>The "Records of the Grand Historian" "Suoyin" says: "According to the 'Spring and Autumn Union Sincerity Diagram,' the Ziwei Emperor is the essence of Taiyi. Zhengyi says: 'Taiyi is the most honorable of the heavenly gods.'" Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty began to worship Taiyi based on the words of Miao Ji. The worship became even more prevalent during the Tang Dynasty. In the early years of Tianbao, the Eight Palaces were also worshiped, called the Nine Palaces Noble Gods. Emperor Xuanzong once changed the Zhongshu Sheng (Secretariat) to Ziwei Sheng (Purple Tenuity Secretariat), so in Bai Juyi's poem, there is "Ziwei flowers face Ziwei officials," which, like Han Hong's "Flowers fly everywhere in the spring city," is a single-line transmission. Ziwei officials refer to officials of the Zhongshu Sheng, which is like the old cabinet and the Grand Council, and today's Executive Yuan. In the seventh year of Tiansheng during the Song Dynasty, Emperor Shenzong decreed the construction of Taiyi Palace in the capital to worship the god Taiyi. The image of the god wears a Tongtian crown and a crimson gauze robe. The clothing worn in the Heavenly Official pictures commonly hung in halls today probably originates from this. However, why are Heavenly Official pictures still popular among the people? One reason is that they can bring blessings and ward off evil spirits. The "History of Song Dynasty, Rites" says:</p>
<p>"The Taiyi star is to the right of the Purple Palace Gate, south of Tianyi, and is called the Noble God of Heaven... Bian sends sixteen gods to know about wind, rain, water, drought, war, famine, epidemics, and disasters. The "Tang Shu" (Book of Tang) says that the Nine Palaces Noble Gods are in charge of water and drought, and the rules of the Sixteen Gods of Taiyi Hall are to assist the human ruler."</p>
<p>This is the origin of the folk hanging of Heavenly Official pictures. Secondly, because the Heavenly Official is a noble god, officials and wealthy families are happy to hang images of the Heavenly Official in their halls, calling it a "Promotion Chart," which is like the opening scene of old dramas, where an actor in a crimson robe and "Mian" crown, wearing a mask, holding an ivory tablet, performs a dance called "Heavenly Official Bestows Blessings," also known as "Jumping for Promotion." If there are officials present, the "Jumping for Promotion" is repeated to please them, and the officials reward them by throwing red paper packets onto the stage, and the actors respond with auspicious words like "Rising to the Top Soon" and "First-Rank Official."</p>
<p>Why do people worship him as the God of Bestowing Fortune? This is because China is an agricultural country, and if one only seeks "favorable weather and abundant harvests," one can achieve "national peace and prosperity." And the god Taiyi, as mentioned in the edict of the sixth day of the tenth month of the third year of Tianbao,</p>
<p>"The Nine Palaces Noble Gods are in charge of water and drought, assisting the Emperor, protecting the people, helping to ensure abundant harvests, and preventing disasters."</p>
<p>If he can ensure abundant harvests and prevent disasters, then he not only bestows blessings but also grants wealth. China's wealth comes from agriculture, so if the god Taiyi has such power, how can he not be worshiped as the God of Bestowing Fortune!</p>
<p>However, the God of Wealth worshiped by the business community is the Five-Way God of Wealth. This is from the perspective of the merchant's own business; since goods come from all directions, there must be a God of Wealth in all directions so that wealth does not go to waste. The five ways are the east, south, west, and north, plus the "center," where the business is located, and the wealth from all five directions is complete. The Five-Way Gods of Wealth all wear helmets and armor, which is very different from the nobility and splendor of the God of Bestowing Fortune. Some say that the Five-Way Gods of Wealth are from a green forest background and have sworn brotherhood, so they appear as martial men. Others say that they are the gods of the five directions and five Jia. Or that they are like the Five Tong and Five Saints worshiped in the countryside. However, those who worship them must use wild game, sheep heads, pig heads, and dried wax carp (in Shanghai, they are called Yuanbao fish, with red threads pierced through their dorsal fins, kept in water basins for worship. After worship, some are released into the lotus pond in the Yu Garden, and some are thrown into the Huangpu River. Therefore, on the fourth day of the first lunar month, one often hears vendors carrying them on their shoulders and shouting, "Do you want to buy Yuanbao fish?"). Chickens use white roosters, and wine uses distilled spirits, all to take their white color, symbolizing silver.</p>
<p>There are also Tibetan Gods, and the worshiper must prepare white clothing and hats to welcome and worship them, and it is said that they must not be seen by others. When asked why, they say that the Tibetan Gods also wear white clothing and hats. It is also said that if you see a white mouse, there must be hidden silver. I have always wondered where the saying that white mice bring wealth comes from. The fancy mice played with today are as white as snow, but they are not the white mice that the Chinese are talking about. As for Zhao Xuantan as the God of Wealth, Ming Lu Can's "Gengyi Compilation" once recorded his miraculous stories: It states</p>
<p>"Zhang Tingfang, a villager, liked to fight crickets, but he always lost, even to the point of using his furniture to pay off debts, thus ruining his property. He usually respected the god Xuantan, so he prayed sincerely and told him of his difficulties. At night, he dreamed that the god said, 'Do not worry, I will send the Black Tiger to help you. Now it is incarnated under a tree in the southeast corner of the Tianfei Palace. Go and get it.' Zhang dug in the soil and found a cricket, deep black and very large. When he used it to fight, he won every time, and in a matter of days, he earned back twice what he had lost."</p>
<p>However, it is still unknown when Zhao Xuantan began to be worshiped. Also, the shop sign firmly placed above the counter in stores is called the Qinglong sign. Qinglong is in charge of wealth and happiness. On the opening day of business, a picture of the God of Wealth is often pasted on the Qinglong shop sign. When asked, merchants only know that it is so, but they do not know why. The year before last, I met the Tibetan Rong Zeng Kanbu and learned that in Tibetan Tantra, there is the supreme and most victorious Holy White God of Wealth method. His saying is indeed consistent with the Five-Way Gods of Wealth and Qinglong White Mice that are spread among the people today. The Great Master Rongzeng is one of the great disciples of the 16th Panchen Lama and is well-versed in exoteric and esoteric teachings, so he is the Religious Plenipotentiary Representative of the Panchen Lama in China. He also served as the tutor of Jiamuyan Hutuktu, and thus has the honorific title of Rongzeng Kanbu. He once said that the Two Holy White Gods of Wealth have one face and two arms, holding a three-pronged spear in the right hand and a club in the left hand, sitting on a Qinglong. To the east is the blue Vajra Dakini, holding a vajra in the right hand and a vessel filled with various conditions in the left hand. To the south is the yellow Treasure Seat Dakini, holding a treasure basin in the right hand and an iron hook in the left hand. To the west is the red Lotus Dakini, holding a lotus flower in the right hand and a Dharma banner adorned with five treasures in the left hand. To the north is the green Karma Dakini, holding a crossed vajra in the right hand and a white mouse in the left hand. If this is indeed the case, it is consistent with the number of the Five-Way Gods of Wealth in China. And the God of Wealth in the north holds a white mouse, so it is said that seeing a white mouse means that one will receive unexpected wealth. The God of Wealth is called the White God of Wealth, and those who do not know better mistakenly think that he is a god wearing white clothes, and they also welcome him with white clothes. Because the White God of Wealth rides a Qinglong, Qinglong is associated with wealth and happiness (this is also seen in the saying about livestock). The Gods of Wealth are all like Vajras and hold implements such as hooks and clubs, so the Five-Way Gods of Wealth in China also wear helmets and armor. How could one know that the Five-Way Gods of Wealth worshiped did not originate from the White God of Wealth "spread" by Tibetan Tantra? Because esoteric Buddhism was not allowed to be spread in Han Chinese territory, people only knew of this "saying", which was misrepresented and further misrepresented, resulting in the misunderstandings among the common people today. Since the Great Master Rongzeng settled in Shanghai and promoted Tibetan Tantra, the White God of Wealth method has been able to spread to the world.</p>
<p>I once asked why Buddhism has a God of Wealth? The master stated: "The venerable one once saw a starving person by the roadside, and was infinitely compassionate. He thought of begging for food in the city to feed him, but when he returned, it was too late to save him. He wanted to cut off his own flesh to feed him, but the starving person refused. The venerable one thought and thought, but could not find a good solution. He then thought that poverty is the greatest pity in the world. So he asked Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva for guidance. The Bodhisattva then manifested Green Tara from one eye to save the world, and manifested the White God of Wealth from the other eye to bless the world, relieve poverty, and prevent people from wandering and suffering, and enduring all kinds of pain. This is a great compassionate and merciful heart to relieve suffering and disaster, and wants those who enjoy wealth to create blessings for the public, benefiting themselves and others. If one engages in harming others and benefiting oneself, and accumulation through exploitation is the only skill, and one becomes rich and starts a family, how can one not remember that wealth is indeed valuable, but blessings must be cultivated? Benefiting others and oneself is the way to cultivate both wealth and blessings. As the ancient saying goes: 'Doing good brings a hundred blessings, and doing evil brings a hundred misfortunes.' The natural law of cause and effect cannot be completely ignored. I sincerely hope that those with wealth will use it well and not be harmed by too much wealth, using it to harm others instead of benefiting them. If that is the case, then if the God of Wealth is spiritual, he will deeply regret that his handling is not fair and that he has lost the original intention of benefiting the public."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Anecdotes of the Tobacco Office <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Speaking of which, among the many newly discovered plants in modern times, none is more fortunate in being welcomed by the majority of people than "tobacco"! Since the late fifteenth century, when Columbus set foot on the New World, it has been found almost everywhere from the Far East to the West. Its magic power is truly small!</p>
<p>The homeland of tobacco is in the small Antilles islands of the West Indies, on a small island called Tabago, not far from Venezuela, now under British jurisdiction. The Spanish called tobacco Tabacco, which is where our former translation of "danbagu" (淡巴菇) comes from. In 1492 AD, when Columbus and his companions first landed on the island of Cuba, they saw indigenous Indians holding a ball of burning dry grass in their mouths, inhaling its fumes with each puff. Later, throughout the West Indies, they saw this same behavior almost everywhere. It turned out that the Indians smoked not only for its intoxicating aroma but also because they believed it "could cure all diseases" and gain the help of the gods. Shamans would also begin to announce omens of good and bad fortune when they were dizzy from the narcotic smoke, just like the priestesses of the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece, who would chew the bitter leaves of the laurel tree until they were delirious before prophesying on behalf of the god Apollo. Strangely, the local warriors had to smoke "a bag of courage-boosting smoke" before the two armies faced off. When making peace, they also had to first send each other a "peace pipe." As for the Indians' exquisitely carved pipes, they can truly be called works of art. Columbus's companions and their successors saw how "mysterious" tobacco was to the natives and could not help but try it themselves. The lucky tobacco then strode onto the broad road!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this plant containing nicotine toxins, with the help of Spanish or Portuguese sailors—Columbus's companions who discovered America, or Cortez's companions who conquered Mexico—had moved to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe by the end of the fifteenth century. However, this habit of smoking may have still been limited to a few humble sailors had it not been promoted by the French court from above and imitated by the courtiers below. It turned out that in 1560 AD, a French ambassador to Portugal named Jean Nicot (1530-1600) received a few tobacco seeds among the gifts he received. At that time, tobacco was already famous for its ability to cure diseases, especially headaches. Nicot then cultivated these few seeds in his own garden, personally testing the efficacy of its "panacea" leaves. Then, in the manner of a courtier skilled at ingratiating himself, he offered the fine powder of tobacco leaves to the Queen Mother of France, Catherine de Medici, who was suffering from recurrent headaches. The Queen Mother trusted and enjoyed sniffing the snuff, and the courtiers followed suit. Soon, it spread like wildfire throughout French society. Tobacco's official title was raised to "Queen Mother's Herb." The toxin extracted from it was given Nicot's name. Another person who contributed to its spread was a priest named André Thevet. In 1566, he traveled to Brazil, saw the natives smoking, and transmitted the tobacco and the method of using it to France, coinciding with Nicot. In his writings, he also said: "In Brazil, there is a herb called Petun. People say that it can cleanse the mucus in the brain and is very beneficial to the body, but if one inhales too much, it can also intoxicate like strong wine." The introduction of tobacco to England was slightly later. In 1586, the famous maritime adventurer Drake brought it and potatoes back to England when he returned from America. Since then, the habit of smoking or sniffing tobacco has spread gradually from near to far.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Asia, since the Portuguese and Spanish successively occupied the South Sea Islands and the Philippine Islands in the early sixteenth century, the cultivation of tobacco certainly began at this time. China and the Philippines are only separated by a strip of water, so people from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong naturally obtained tobacco seeds first and spread them widely. Therefore, Chinese records of the origin of tobacco generally only say: "Tobacco is also called Acacia Herb, or danbagu in Chinese. It first came from Luzon and entered China in the late Ming Dynasty. Nowadays, everyone uses it, even women and young girls, with golden pipes and brocade pouches displayed alongside mirrors and ivory rulers." (See "Tea Leisure Talks").</p>
<p>There are three ways to use tobacco: chewing, sniffing, and smoking. The first seems to have not spread, and the second has also been eliminated. The only one that is popular everywhere now is smoking. Pipes were created by the American Indians, and water pipes were invented by the Persians. When, by whom, or how did these two things spread to China? I can only write an interjection mark.</p>
<p>Now, let me talk about what kind of reactions tobacco aroused after it spread to the Old World. The first to launch fierce and merciless attacks on tobacco were, of course, people in the medical community. However, this was only verbal and written outcry. Once the Catholic Church and, in particular, those strictly enforcing autocratic emperors joined the battle, good essays were produced. Let's start with England. King James I, who succeeded Queen Elizabeth and advocated the divine right of kings, had a deeply painful aversion to tobacco. In 1619, he issued an edict to uproot all tobacco planted in the country. In 1628, Pope Urban VIII also launched a total attack on tobacco, ordering that anyone who smoked or sniffed tobacco in the church should be expelled from the Church. The Turkish emperor Amurat IV (1611-1640), based on the article in the Koran that prohibits drunkenness, thought that smoking could also make people drunk, so he issued an order: anyone who smoked would have his lips cut off, and anyone who sniffed tobacco would have his nose cut off! Later, he even added the death penalty by hanging to the smoker. The Persian King Abbas I (1557-1628) was even more severe. Anyone who smoked or sniffed tobacco would be skinned and stuffed with straw! As for Moscow, Russia, because a smoker carelessly caused a fire, Grand Duke Michel Federowitch issued an order in 1650 prohibiting smoking. First offenders were flogged, and repeat offenders were executed. ... So smoking was often subject to many condemnations and tortures at the time?</p>
<p>But some people may ask, what was the success of these tobacco bans? The answer is ineffective. The so-called prohibition only prohibits those who prohibit, and those who smoke will smoke. Some people even risk their lives and defy national bans to smoke. As a result, the tobacco ban, on the contrary, acted as publicity for tobacco, and the number of smokers increased day by day. When Peter the Great of Russia returned home in 1698 after touring Western Europe, he reversed the government's previous attitude of suppression and ordered that "all Russians, whether they like it or not, must learn to smoke." This is the only monarch I know of who publicly advocated smoking! Later, governments of various countries, seeing that tobacco bans were ineffective, turned to using it. Some monopolize it, and some tax it. Now, tobacco is a product that can earn such a large income for the governments of various countries!</p>

<h3 id="e96">Twists and Turns of Cotton Cloth in the 29th Year <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn industry in the 29th year was full of changes and overwhelming waves. Although there were failures in the middle, the results were still mostly profitable. However, it was not as satisfactory as the previous year, because the range of buying and selling was too wide, and the difference between the highs and lows was more than one yuan. Some suffered setbacks and were greatly hurt. The price of Shuangma yarn increased more than doubled compared to the previous year. The general outline of this is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At the end of the 28th year, most opinions were still calm. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 735 yuan. The new year started with a red disk, and the situation was still calm. Then, speculators began to actively engage in activities. At the same time, the exchange rate weakened, and domestic demand was strong. As a result, the yarn market was driven by two forces and naturally gradually rose. At this time, there were both spot yarn and futures transactions in the market. For a time, it was in a speculative frenzy, beyond the norm. The peak of 20-count Shuangma yarn was once seen at 1,660 yuan, and futures reached over 1,800 yuan. Unexpectedly, after May 2, the exchange rate suddenly rose sharply, and the market suddenly changed drastically, like a bolt from the blue. The market fell sharply, like a river dike, with no possibility of turning back. As a result, yarn companies went bankrupt, managers fled, and market quarrels and fights were heard from time to time.</p>
<p>(2) Until mid-June, the lowest price of 20-count Shuangma yarn broke through the 1,000 yuan mark to 800 yuan, a difference of 1,000 yuan compared to the peak price of 1,800 yuan in mid-May. Speculation suffered a heavy blow. The most painful were a batch of arbitrageurs. The goods at high prices had already been received, but when it came time to deliver the goods the following month, no one accepted them. The buyers went bankrupt and avoided meeting. As a result, the losses were huge. The speculative tide came to an end. Therefore, in July, August, and September, the price hovered around 900 yuan for a long rest.</p>
<p>(3) Entering the end of September to the beginning of October, due to the general speculators, the father made a comeback, and the quiet became active. At the same time, the "Exchange" was established and opened, and the 20-count Japanese yarn floating in the market was collected to serve as chips for the institute's needs. Secondly, new cotton entered the market, and a certain party strictly controlled it, blocking the source. Small banks in this port were created like mushrooms after rain, and everyone went straight to the yarn market. Moreover, if the customers had no money to receive the goods, they could advance the money to collect the goods on their behalf. If there were no goods to sell, they could deliver the goods on their behalf. As a result, it became completely speculative. As a result, you bought and I bought, and the chips were temporarily insufficient for distribution, so the market price soared. Therefore, at the end of the year, the highest price was 1,459 yuan. All the companies and speculators, after summarizing, were still very lucky and profitable. Many turned danger into safety, so everyone still smiled and welcomed the Five-Way God of Wealth, hoping that the coming year would be better than the previous year. However, the high price of cloth was unaffordable for the common people.</p>
<p>Checking the high price of yarn, the biggest driving force is nothing more than the abundance of floating capital. Speculators hoard it in warehouses and do not sell it if they do not make money. The rise at the end of the previous year was due to the shrinking of foreign exchange, and the yarn rose from 1,200 yuan to over 1,400 yuan. Finally, the bill of exchange has been transferred for a long time, and the raw materials for 20-count yarn are still cheap. The price of the red disk, whether it will rise or fall, is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Intermission Supplement: Foreign Exchange and Gold Market Report <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, this newspaper suspended publication for six days. The gold and foreign exchange markets operated for two and a half days. This is a supplementary record of those days:</p>
<p>January 23rd (Thursday): The Shanghai gold market's unofficial trading continued to decline, falling to around the 6,600 yuan mark. This was due to the impending freezing of Axis countries' funds by the United States. The foreign exchange market was weak, and with bill traders selling, the market opened at 6,610 yuan, subsequently dropping to a low of 6,570 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, the weakness in foreign exchange suddenly stopped. Short covering surged, pushing the price up to 6,647 yuan in an instant. Banque de Syrie et du Liban sold off, and the market closed at noon at 6,627 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 6,620 yuan. Bill traders re-emerged, gradually pushing the price down to 6,595 yuan. The market closed at three o'clock at 6,605 yuan, a small squeeze of 45 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 77 yuan, with a total trading volume of 6,000 to 7,000 taels. The rollover from January to February futures saw buyers paying a premium of 225 yuan. Cash transactions were priced 10 yuan higher than futures. Ornamental gold remained at 680 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The official exchange rates of both the Central Bank and HSBC remained unchanged. In the unofficial market, both British and American currencies opened stronger at 0.03125. British gold for three months was 4.4375, and American gold was 5.4375. The Bank of China and speculators sold off successively, leading to a slightly firmer trend. In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric began buying sterling, but the effect was limited. As the Bank of China continued to sell, the evening closing rates were British gold at 4.4375, American gold at 5.46875, February futures at 4.421875 for British gold and 5.4375 for American gold. British long positions were 0.03125 to 0.046875, and American gold long positions were 0.0625.</p>
<p>January 24th (Friday): The Shanghai gold market initially declined before rebounding, continuing to hover around the 6,600 yuan level. The foreign exchange market weakened briefly before recovering to par. Market sentiment shifted from fatigue to neutral. Thus, Jen Chung Yung and Deutsche Bank initially sold small amounts from an opening of 6,570 yuan down to 6,535 yuan. However, they were soon absorbed by Yee Foong, Cheung Wo, and Banque de Syrie et du Liban, gradually rising to 6,613 yuan. Bill traders sold off, causing a setback at noon. The afternoon session became more stable, eventually closing at 6,606 yuan, a slight increase of one yuan. The daily range was 78 yuan, with a trading volume of 4,000 to 5,000 taels. The rollover spread remained at 220 to 225 yuan, with cash still trading at a 10 yuan premium to futures. Ornamental gold was 680 yuan. The foreign exchange market was initially weak but recovered. The Bank of China supplied and sold, causing a surge in rates to British gold at 4.453125 and American gold at 5.5. However, there was a sudden appetite for buying. Hong Kong Electric aggressively bought British gold, weakening February settlements to only 4.40625. As the Bank of China continued to sell, the trend stabilized, and the closing rates for British and American currency futures were the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>January 25th (Saturday): The gold market operated for half a day. Rumors suddenly arose about the British evacuating their merchants from Shanghai, triggering a surge in buying. As a result, the market opened at 6,607 yuan, then declined to 6,603 yuan. Under the aggressive buying from Ta Fung, Ming Fung, Cheung Hing Yung, Banque de Syrie et du Liban, etc., the price soared to 6,660 yuan. Thereafter, there was a small setback, but the fluctuations were small. The market closed at 10 o'clock at 6,650 yuan, up 44 yuan. The daily range was 57 yuan, with a trading volume of 2,000 to 3,000 taels in half a day. The rollover traded at 225 yuan, with buyers paying the premium. Cash was 20 yuan higher than futures. Ornamental gold was 680 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The black market was also buoyed by positive sentiment. Chinese merchants, speculators, and Hong Kong Electric entered the market to close positions. Importers needed to settle tobacco accounts. Banks were reluctant to supply. The gold market surged, and the trend gradually gathered momentum. At the close, spot British gold was 4.421875, January at 4.40625, February at 4.390625. Spot American gold was 5.4375, January at 5.40625, and February at 5.375. This represented a tightening of 0.015625 to 0.03125 for British currency and 0.03125 to 0.0625 for American currency. There was no afternoon trading, it was said.</p>

<p>— Liu Zhonglian</p>
<p>(Continued from the 20th)</p>
<p>According to statistics, our country imports millions of dan (a unit of dry measure) of rice from foreign countries every year. There was a slight decrease in 1919 and 1920, but the highest amounts were in 1923, 1927, and 1932, all exceeding 20 million dan. As for exports, the customs records show that only the year 1919 exceeded one million dan, with the remaining years only reaching tens of thousands of dan. The difference between exports and imports is significant. The following is a breakdown of the quantity of rice imported from overseas in the last three years, to examine the source of each region (unit: dan).</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, all countries in the world have regarded food self-sufficiency as the most important principle for national establishment. Our country's climate and geography make it the only agricultural country in the world. However, based on the above, we know that our country is not only unable to achieve self-sufficiency, but also relies on other countries for its food supply, and the annual imports are gradually increasing. This is absolutely contrary to the principles of a strong and prosperous nation. Therefore, the number of foreign rice imports must be expected to decrease day by day. In other words, the domestic production volume must be expected to increase day by day, and the causes of external reliance must be expected to decrease.</p>
<p>Those who talk about rice prices today either say that we should continue to import foreign rice to make up for the shortage, or that we should strictly prohibit hoarding to prevent price increases. However, although it is necessary to replenish the lack of rice and prohibit hoarding, these are merely stopgap measures that are difficult to have a fundamental effect. It is essential to promote agriculture, expand land reclamation, increase rice production, and seek harmony between the supply and demand of rice. The following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Advocate agricultural education and promote agricultural affairs to develop our country's agriculture and become a truly agricultural country.</p>
<p>(2) Take advantage of our country's vast land and large population to fully utilize the productive capacity of rice-producing areas and open up as much wasteland as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Merchants should consider the overall situation regarding the future of national food supply and should not use rice as a tool for speculation.</p>
<p>(4) Rice-producing areas should continue to sow rice, and should not abandon rice cultivation and plant other crops due to petty profits.</p>
<p>If the above can be earnestly implemented, there will be significant results. After five years, there will be no need to import foreign rice. After ten years, the surplus can be sold to foreign countries. All of this depends on the efforts of our country from top to bottom. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e103">I Am a Bachelor <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>Two weeks after the exam, I went to school to get my graduation certificate. In the picture on it, I was wearing a square hat and had a big smile—as if full of hope… Indeed, when the picture was taken, I was full of hope—an engineering graduate from a prestigious university, how could I not have hope?</p>
<p>But, this bachelor has been out of school for two weeks now. Aside from shutting himself up in his small attic and sighing, finding two friends who share his fate, and taking some clothes and books to the pawnshop, what else can he do?</p>
<p>A letter came from home, saying that they heard I graduated and hoped I could send some money back, but I am unable to support myself. I dragged out the last silk shirt from my suitcase and went out into the street.</p>
<p>From the high counter, I exchanged it for three dollars and twenty cents and a sneering laugh. I fled the pawnshop.</p>
<p>Walking on the street, the cold wind deliberately teased me, making me shiver like a falling leaf. A crowd of people were gathered ahead, looking at something. I instinctively glanced over. It was a plea for help:</p>
<p>"Refugee from former Beiping… Elementary school teacher… Suffering from hunger and cold… Seeking assistance…"</p>
<p>I didn't have time to finish reading—no, I didn't dare to look closely. I squeezed out of the crowd in panic and went home. Unconsciously, I opened the newspaper, filled with stories of suicide and unemployment; unemployment and suicide…</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, my head feeling dizzy. Suddenly, a vision: I seemed to be sitting on the sidewalk, huddled up, next to a sign:</p>
<p>"Refugee… University engineering graduate…"</p>
<p>I jumped up in terror.</p>
<p>"Ah, no, no, I am an engineering bachelor, a bachelor… Graduation is not unemployment… The new China is growing… Bachelor…"</p>

<h3 id="e104">Miss Ying <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yao</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Miss Ying, the dancing girl in the front room, wasn't dancing because of economic pressure, but out of sheer willingness. She had to beg and plead countless times to get her face-saving mother to give her "golden promise." She was happier than if she had ascended to the throne.</p>
<p>If you talked to Miss Ying, you would know that she was someone who especially liked "pretty boys." Her conversation often revolved around "pretty boys." Of course, in Miss Ying's mind, her future "son-in-law" would naturally be a handsome, young, and beautiful pretty boy. Little did her father know that her current husband was actually a fat, short, and old man in his forties!</p>
<p>Whenever her mother mentioned this marriage, her first question was always, "How old is he?"</p>
<p>"He's only a little over forty," her mother replied nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"What? Forty years old?" she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's not old, not old at all. He has a round face and is very likeable. You can't tell he's forty. I heard he's a compradore on a foreign ship. Just talking about his wealth, he has accumulated hundreds of thousands. If you marry him, you'll never have to worry about clothes or food. Good daughter, go take a look, and you'll believe what I say." Her mother used her "silver tongue" to persuade her. Hearing about the millions of dollars in assets, Miss Ying was a little moved and agreed to go with her mother to see him.</p>
<p>That compradore really knew how to "read people's faces." He only spoke a few words to Miss Ying and figured out what she wanted. He took out five or six bankbooks from his bag and said like he was giving a speech, "The five thousand dollars in here are for my eldest son's education and wedding expenses; this is for my youngest son's… If you are willing to marry me, I can immediately give your mother three thousand dollars for her retirement, one thousand dollars for the wedding banquet, and also deposit several thousand dollars into a bank for you."</p>
<p>Miss Ying, who loved vanity, was a little dizzy listening to this. At this time, she was just imagining riding in cars, living in Western-style houses, and eating fancy meals… She temporarily forgot about "pretty boys" and "ugly boys." She happily agreed.</p>
<p>Back home, all Miss Ying said was, "Mom, that man's hair is white, and you still say he's not old."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, people who do big business use their brains too much, so their hair always turns white quickly. Besides, you're already someone else's person now. When you go out with him tomorrow, you have to act a little more affectionate." "It's embarrassing to walk with someone so old and run into acquaintances."</p>
<p>"Nonsense."</p>
<p>Three days after the wedding, the compradore was about to leave. It was said that he wouldn't be back for over a month. Before leaving, he left five hundred dollars for living expenses and specially accompanied her to buy a gold ring, a radio, a coat, pajamas, a carpet, biscuits, candy… many things. Finally, he asked her to go to a cram school to study, spending almost a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>A week after the compradore left, Miss Ying began to indulge in extravagance in order to practice her hedonism. She didn't care about studying or not, she just went whenever she felt like it. She did everything: watching plays, playing cards, smoking, and going to restaurants. The money was spent like water. In just over thirty days, the five hundred dollars was completely spent.</p>
<p>Oh no, the money was all gone, and he hadn't come back yet. Miss Ying was like an ant on a hot pot, pacing around the house all day, constantly flipping through the calendar.</p>
<p>The kind neighbor next door joked, "No wonder people say 'a hundred days of kindness for one night as husband and wife.' It's really true. Look how anxious Miss Ying is!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, who cares about him? She's just waiting for his money," Miss Ying said coldly.</p>

<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>A friend in Hong Kong has a sore on his arm and is undergoing surgery. Unfortunately, while he was sick, he suddenly vomited blood. An X-ray examination revealed bleeding in the right lung. The doctor told him that it would take a year to recover. On such a painful sickbed, my friend wrote the following brave words in his letter: "Please don't worry. I accept everything given to me, whether it is illness or pain, with courage, and I hope to benefit from it. I now have a lot of time to think, read, and experience a 'new life.' I hope you won't laugh at my 'sour grapes' attitude."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Begonia <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, upon further thought, Rong Kui's greedy heart made him bolder. Hadn't the old woman said that if he could find a way to have Begonia meet the shopkeeper's wife alone, he could get two hundred yuan in cash and a pair of gold bracelets? Adding those up, there would be at least three hundred yuan. Even if he had no business for a year, he wouldn't lose much. Besides, he thought:</p>
<p>"When a young man and woman meet, how can they not be happy? As long as the boss is happy, he won't sue Yuan Laoqi again, and my job won't be in danger, right?"</p>
<p>But then he thought, if things were exposed, Mr. Wang would definitely sue Begonia, and wouldn't he be implicated as well? Thinking like this, Rong Kui's heart grew cold again.</p>
<p>But in an instant, another thought emerged:</p>
<p>"Bah! What am I afraid of! Mr. Wang is just a silk shop agent, not an official or a soldier. Even if things are exposed, what am I afraid of?"</p>
<p>Then, from Yuan Shaowen, he came up with a plan: Didn't the Wang family's wife want to meet Begonia alone first? As long as he created an opportunity, using Yuan Qi Ye's name, it wouldn't be easy to lure Begonia to the agreed-upon restaurant, right?</p>
<p>The more Rong Kui thought about it, the smoother it seemed. He almost jumped for joy on the road.</p>
<p>That night, Madam Wang indeed dressed up like a flower and sat in the pool, constantly sending waves of deep affection to Begonia on stage. Begonia also began to notice something, because he could see very clearly that in the past month and a half, no matter where he performed, this woman always sat alone in the middle of the second or third row in front of the pool, intently watching him, even on windy and rainy days. Of course, he knew what she meant, and he had even felt pity for her several times. He thought:</p>
<p>"Such an affectionate woman is indeed very admirable."</p>
<p>However, after returning backstage and calming down a bit, he immediately thought of Yuan Shaowen's usual advice to him, and how Yuan, the highly lustful garrison commander, had repeatedly tried to help him out in the past few years, preventing him from doing anything inappropriate to him.

<p>Introducing Child Stars</p>
<h3 id="e108">Shirley Ellis <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>Former Shanghai Female Student Plays Important Role in New Film "Girls Under 21"</p>
<p>Shirley Ellis, who plays an important role in Columbia's new film "Girls Under 21," which has already arrived in Shanghai and is about to be released, used to live in Shanghai as a female student three years ago, dreaming of becoming a star in Hollywood. Now, her dream has come true, and she has stepped onto the silver screen. Her debut film will soon meet the people of Shanghai. Her friends who used to play with her may not remember her when they see the photo above. But if you took off her glasses and added two braids, you would remember this playful little girl very well.</p>
<p>When Shirley was studying at the Western Girls' School, she never paid attention to her textbooks. She was either swinging her two braids and playing on the playground, or singing non-stop and tap dancing without stopping. Her mother also liked this and had a pre-planned plan for her to enter the film industry early on. She was the only protagonist in school plays and had sung in the great broadcasting program hosted by the local XMHA radio station. It seemed that she was destined to become a star one day. When the Shanghai war broke out, her parents took her away from Shanghai and sailed to the sunny coast of California. When passing through Hong Kong, she performed on stage under her mother's direction, broadcasted on radio in Hawaii, and participated in merchant banquets to open the Education Building. She was very active along the way. After arriving at her destination, she enrolled in the most prestigious opera training school in the area to prepare for her entry into the film industry.</p>
<p>Thirteen-year-old Shirley finally passed a strict examination and joined Columbia Pictures as a basic actor, working with Dave O'Brien and Frankie Darro. In the new film, she plays a female student who attempts to join a gang of thugs and is eventually killed in a tense development. She played a strong-willed woman and achieved unexpected success. As a result, the authorities considered her a promising actor who could play complex personalities. Newspapers and magazines have also praised her as the best up-and-coming child star.</p>

<h3 id="e110">China Film Company's "Blitzkrieg" Collaborates with Shanghai Drama School <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Lan</p>
<p>After the completion of "Confucius," the China Film Company, in addition to the already announced "Children of the World," which is actively in progress, is also secretly carrying out a "blitzkrieg strategy," according to our reporter.</p>
<p>China Film's collaborator this time is the Shanghai Drama School. The small students of the Shanghai Drama School, more than a hundred of them, have won unanimous praise from the Ping opera community for their many performances at the Golden Theater. Not only are talented people emerging in large numbers, but the lively and skilled ensemble performances are also rarely seen. They had wanted to appear on the silver screen for a year. At that time, China Film was filming "Confucius." The principal of the Drama School, Chen Chengyin, had a close friendship with China Film's manager, Jin Xinmin (Jin Xinmin is a director of the school), and they talked about this matter. However, due to the busy work of "Confucius," it was impossible to realize it at that time. This matter was "left for another time." After "Confucius" was completed, the entire student body of the Drama School, led by the teachers, watched the test screening, and the two sides brought up the old matter again. Recently, they finally negotiated everything and decided to cooperate.</p>
<p>What is the name of the collaborative play? Due to strict confidentiality, it is impossible to find out. All that is known is that the director of this play is Fei Mu, and the protagonist is these hundred or so young actors. The content of the play includes both fashionable elements and the stage scenes of Ping opera. It is a new type of Ping opera-based musical film. It is said that it will be filmed at the same time as "Children of the World," as filming one play in rotation can give the directors and actors a chance to rest and recuperate.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: After receiving this manuscript, we called Mr. Fei Mu by phone. According to the answer, this is just a new attempt that he has long desired. The script was written long ago. As for the name of the play, it cannot be announced yet because it has not been determined.)</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Surname and Poetry of Liu Rushi <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Recently, I wrote the novel "Zhangtai Willow" for this newspaper, picking up anecdotes about Mu Zhai and Liu Rushi, compiling them haphazardly into a piece, hoping to amuse readers. Because I live on an isolated island, and lack materials at hand, with limited references, I don't know if it's acceptable. I once received a letter from Mr. Liu Yazi, showing me two poems, and stating that Liu Rushi's original surname was Yang, and her given name was Ai, while Liu was her assumed surname. Her younger sister, Zi, should be called Yang Zi, and not Liu Zi, and so on. He also kindly gifted me the book "Ci Zheng of Lize," which was deeply appreciated. "Ci Zheng" was compiled by the late Mr. Chen Qubing of Wujiang. According to my initial investigation of Liu Rushi's surname, the biography of Madam Liu is quite vague. However, I found in a certain notebook that Liu Rushi's original name was Yang Ai, with the style name Yinglian... and so on. I found the name Yang Ai difficult to understand, so in my humble work, I only mentioned Yinglian and omitted it. Now I know that Yang is a misspelling of Yang, so Rushi's original surname was Yang. Many people in this place use assumed surnames. Rushi is one of her names, with the style name Yu Wu, also known as Hedong Jun, named by Mu Zhai. Mu Zhai also respectfully called her Liu Jun, without using her style name. She lived in the I Heard Chamber. Rushi has a poem about the I Heard Chamber in spring, saying: "From here, willow flowers are like a dream, in the past, the misty moon was a source of sorrow." It is truly popular. She wrote "E Yin Poetry Collection," "Miscellaneous Records of the Hongdou Mountain Villa," "Ling Jian Pavilion Small Collection," etc., but I regret that I have not seen them. Firstly, the novel style is different from biographies, so it's difficult to draw accurate conclusions. Secondly, the matter is trivial, and doesn't involve recording great figures. Now I extract one poem about the cold willow from "Ci Zheng of Lize," to the tune of "Ji Ming Chi": "With hate, the cold tide, with no mercy, the setting sun, it is indeed the south bank. Further blowing the lonely shadow of the headdress stem, still remembering the catkins flying in the past. Moreover, in the evening, the misty waves are hazy, seeing the traveler specially thin-waisted, like dancing. A total of a kind of bleakness, completely haggard, still having the beautiful lines of Yantai. Spring days brew autumn days' sorrow, remembering past romance, secretly hurting so much. Even though there are many painted boats surrounding the embankment, deserted, the water and clouds are still as before. Remembering a little spring breeze from the past, separated by several layers, eyebrows sadly bitter. Specially the plum soul, the pale moon at dusk, whispering deeply with her." From this one scale, one can generally see the rest. Clear talent and beautiful qualities, extremely rare, it is a pity that she entrusted herself to the wrong person, and could not express her loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. Alas! Is this perhaps the misfortune of Hedong Jun? As for Mr. Liu Yazi's poems, they are sufficient for research, and can also add an interesting passage to the end of my humble work. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Xiangchun wrote a portrait of Hedong Jun, titled "A Beauty in Pink Can Discuss Military Affairs, How Is She Different From Liang Hongyu (as seen in Mu Zhai's collection, Tou Bi Ji), alas, Minister Qian, growing old in vain! The peerless Yang Yinglian, why does she adopt my family name? At the same time, Cao Mazi, a chivalrous figure shines brightly (Liu Jingting was originally Cao Mazi, also not surnamed Liu)."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Founding of the Golden Star Training Class, Ding Ziming's Sister Receives Much Attention <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianyun, the host of Golden Star Company, recently established the Golden Star Drama and Film Training Class to promote new talent. It is not unprecedented for production companies to establish training classes, but according to Jianyun, the Golden Star training class is completely different from previous ones, and places special emphasis on the cultivation and character of the students. Therefore, even newcomers with particularly strong talent in acting will not be accepted if they do not have considerable cultivation and good character.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Zhou is very careful in hiring professors for the training class. For example, the couple Huang Zuolin and Jin Yunzhi, who teach acting, Yao Xinnong and Zhou Tiebai, who teach Chinese and foreign drama history, and Zhang Hao and others, who teach music, are all learned figures in the film and drama circles. Zhou Jianyun himself also teaches the course "History of Chinese Film." The training class started on January 17th, and those who truly have confidence in film art can still join as transfer students.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou also said: Ding Ziming's younger sister, Ciming, is also a student in the Golden Star training class. He has great expectations for Ding Ciming, believing that she has considerable achievements in cultivation and learning, and may become a promising newcomer on the screen.</p>

<p>The Lido Drama Society originally scheduled to perform the three-act satirical play "Before Leaving," written by Jiang Liu, at the Russian Art Theatre at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII on the 27th of this month. However, they temporarily received an order from the French Municipal Council to stop the performance due to the proximity of "January 28th," so the date was changed to today (30th), with two performances during the day and evening. Ticket holders for the sold-out performance on the 27th can still use their tickets for the two performances today.</p>
