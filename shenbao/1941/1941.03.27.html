<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹的動態</h3>
<p>這决歐洲大戰，意外的在巴爾幹一隅並沒有重大軍事發展；義希戰爭至現在爲止，還祗是局部戰爭的性質，至今尚未與英德間的主力戰合流；德國對巴爾幹的經營，雖恃武力爲威脅，却亦至今尚無止面的戰爭的動作。在這同時，交戰國雙方以至第三國家，在這一方面的進退推移，勾心鬥角的，却比任何他處爲深刻，而國際外交關係的錯雜繁複，亦於此一隅允成大觀。到最近的二三日，南斯拉夫的締盟與蘇土不侵宣言的重申，已經是顯示着各交戰國和關係國家在這一方面的外交與政治運用都達到了最大限度，其對於歐戰本體，亦將發揮其具有劃時代的決定意義</p>
<p>半年餘以來，德方對於東南歐洲的經營，在政治和經濟方面採取着攻勢；而軍事性質的運用，則保持其守熱的安排。從多瑙流域到巴爾幹半島，都是德國的大後力，也是其取得燃料食糧和種種物資的重要倉庫。另一方面，因爲在巴爾幹的尖端上站着英方與國的希臘土耳其，更與英方的近東軍事根據地隔海相望，又是英軍攻德比較最便捷的進路。是以當去秋歐西戰事漸人僵持局面以後，德國便轉向東面發展，以强力陸續把那些無告的中小國家置於自己的鐵腕之下。事非偶然，蓋希特勒自有其重要的基本理由；第一，務求避免戰爭波及多瑙流域和巴爾幹；第二，避免尖銳的刺激蘇聯。此其意義，前者着眼於經濟的要求，後者注意在政治的因素；但是歸根結底，又都是爲了免蹈兩面作戰的危險，以便一意在西綫對付英國。在這一點上，希特勒的成就自有　相當的效果，而在事實的發展過程中，那兩項信念却又無法兩全。義大利的侵希，已經是巴爾幹發生大戰的前奏；雖然希特勒於此竭力鎭靜自持，祗在和平的標準之下肆其武力脅迫，使保南等國就範，但他並不能絕對把握戰爭之火一定不越過巴爾幹山而北向蔓延，所傳攻希之舉，久久不見實現，其埋由也許即在於此，假使希特勒像莫索里尼一樣的鹵莽和操切，則羅馬尼亞的油田和保加利亞的食糧倉庫必不免早成爲英國空軍下的祭品。至於蘇德之間，納粹的作戰，本以與蘇保持互不侵犯的善鄰關係爲無上的重要條件；蘇聯以往之進兵波蘭，對芬作戰，合併波羅的海三小國，索回比薩拉比亞與北布柯維那，駸駸乎恢復了其帝俄時代在波羅的海的覇權與歐東的疆域，德國皆熟視若無覩。但是另一方面，德國向東南歐洲的進出，却終於引起了蘇方日甚一日的戒心；而且德方勢力越逼近黑海門戶的博斯波羅斯海峽和愛琴海，蘇聯愈益不能抑制其反感。保加利亞的加盟，蘇當局旣已開始宣布其對於德軍行動的異議；到南斯拉夫加盟，更復一變其前此阻止土耳其担負對英義務的一貫熊度，以善意和中立無形鼓勵土方當局對於侵略的抵抗。這是對於德國的警吿，對於南國加盟的示威；對於英國，則其客觀意義實無異於兩年來破天荒的友誼表示。假如德軍繼續南進，即使僅僅以色雷斯或薩羅尼加爲目標，然熟察土耳其意態，殆不會坐視不加抗禦，更無論德方進一步而窺伺海峽。</p>
<p>希特勒對於東南歐洲的經營，到此際爲止、除却希臘一隅而外，可算已獲得全部成功；然其結果，一方面旣使多瑙河流域與整個的巴爾幹都瀕於戰爭的邊緣，另一方面更表面化了蘇德之間貌合神離的裂痕；果再前進一步，必遇到更大的反感和阻力。兩兩相較，其得失孰大，我們固未欲驟下斷語，即在希特勒亦不能不對此更作鄭重的考慮。由巴爾幹而東侵小亞細亞以進窺英方油田和蘇彝士運河，在戰略雖有重大意義，却必須趁蘇土英三方相互不睦的機會纔能倖獲一逞，現在英土有同盟關係存在，蘇土又甫以宣言顯示其共同立塲，則納粹即使本有此種企圖，至此亦必不免以這種新的國際因素之存在而止步。至於包圍希臘，脅迫議和，雖也可能是希特勒東進目標之一。却不能代表其經營巴爾幹的全部意義，因爲應付一個蕞爾半島小邦，希特勒決不視爲有此大費周章的必要，更何况其經營東南歐洲實遠在義大利侵希以前；莫索里尼之不顧德方意旨，倉卒向希臘進兵，無形到是合有對德競賽的意義。如果此際在希境登陸的英軍，還不準備發動巴爾幹的大戰，則自去秋開始的德國鞏固後方獲取資源的經營，將以南國最後加盟與蘇十表明態度而告一段落。即使對於希臘可能繼續有所圖謀，然其性質與分量，祇是因利乘便的餘波，未可視爲德方原來的最後目標所在。此後德方動向，大致將如昨日國際社消息所推測，要轉移到美國和大西洋。</p>

<h3>工董選舉期邇　圖覓取和諧辦法　英美原餓權力必須保持　華董應有更大之發言權　美僑協會討論英美日平均分配議席</h3>
<p>美僑聯合會某員昨日（二十六日）　稱、該會對於下屆工部局董事年選事、刻正討論「數種辦法」、但尙無具體決議、聞美僑聯合會現正討論各點之一、為央美日僑民平均分配工董九席之建議、即美日董各增至三席、餘三席為英董是此外、諒有附同提出之建議、主張華董五人、對公共租界事務、應有史大之發言權、</p>
<p>美僑週內賡續會談</p>
<p>聞美僑聯合會、迄無確切決議、故該會各委員本週內將賡續會談、俾能早獲結果、按美僑聯合會所以進行此項討論者、因英日僑民間現正從事磋商、以期對本年度工董選舉事商獲一君子協定」、英僑謀於本年再度保持現狀、但日僑加以拒絕、而堅持日董至少須增至三人、</p>
<p>談判內容諱莫如深</p>
<p>關於本年工部局董事選舉問題，現正　英美日三方面進行談判解決、但內容如何、各方均諱莫如深、西報記者昨日下午曾訪日僑納稅人會副會長渡邊、叩詢關於日方所要求之工董名額、但渡邊拒絕有所表示、惟稱、日僑納稅人協會、曾舉行會議、討論日方與本市外僑代表談判時、所應採取這立場、此項會議、三數日內即可結束、</p>
<p>僑民團體蘄求和諧</p>
<p>泰晤士報云、本市各僑民團體現正乘工部局展期一周選舉之際、以外交方式、進行談判、以促進各方對上海租界行政之「和諧一、然若因是認為英美僑民團體用削弱英美勢力之代價、以求解決租界行政問題、則大謬不然、據聞美僑方面、對英方讓步、允增加日董一名、深表反對、據英僑協會某領袖談、過去數年間、日本所提出之要求、皆能順利予以應付、本年則因局勢不同、故有人主張成立君子協定」避免選舉、英美雙方意見如能一致、此一問題、不難解決</p>
<p>推翻現狀恐難如原油</p>
<p>據悉、按照工部局電皮章程、外董九名中、其中僅英董五名可予變動、此外如美董一名及華董五名、均在無可變更之例、現日方所抱態度、至少須增加日董一名、其企圖乃欲使英董五席中、讓出一席以與日本、惟此在英美兩國全體　民之　見、僉認英董讓去一席、工部局董事會中一切議案、英美兩國局董勢將成為無足重輕、故對此一席之讓步、均表堅決反對、吾則恐將引起推翻租界現狀之虞、</p>
<p>候選名單迄未送局</p>
<p>按照領事團上月七日之佈吿、英美日三國僑民對於局董候選人名單、應於本月二十五日中午十二時前送交工部局辦公總處、但迄至昨日（二—六日）、英美日三國僑民協會之候選人名單、均無一送交工部局、此種原因、由於英日間正作幕後談判關係、現局董選舉、雖巳展期一星期、但時間巳極迫促、故本屆局董選舉之解決、至下星期中、必可有所決定、</p>

<p>中央銀行上海分行每日上午十時公佈法定外匯率以及徵收平衡稅率、今雖因該行被炸後暫行停業、以致休假期內暫停掛牌、但並不影響外滙及金融市塲、上海外匯黑市行巿、每日由英商匯豐銀行掛牌、昨日依然不動、惟黑巿塲實際交易行巿、因謠言充斥、時有鬆緊、此實不足以為侖、並聞外滙平準基金委員會、對上海之外匯黑巿仍與滙豐華行合作維持、並未變更其旣定政策、</p>
<p>駐滬美軍出動戒備</p>
<p>美駐滬　四海軍聯隊於昨日起、由貝克上校增派士兵巡邏、即就有崗位上亦增添哨兵、從事嚴密戒備、復在防區內之中中交農四銀行門首、出動大隊軍士、以二人至叫人為一組、全副武裝取監視與戒備狀態、此舉係與警務當局協助防範、靜安寺路一帶到處可見美海軍聯隊士兵每隔若干步、即有美海軍一隊、荷槍戎裝梭巡、白克路中央銀行地帶、有美海軍五名駐守、此項措施、短期內不致撤除、</p>

<h3>日本製造機會　外僑揭發陰謀　造作蜚語分化中國內部　目的旣達然後對美開戰</h3>
<p>昨日有各丹納（U.F.Tanner）者、投函字林報云、鑒於最近國際局勢發展、可知日外相松岡洋右柏林之行、實為對美國會通過租借法案之挑　行動、今不妨就日本變更太平洋政策、加以簡短之討論、現下日本在遠東方面、必須對付之主要敵手有二、即美國與中國是也、</p>
<p>日本企圖利用機會</p>
<p>關於日本對美之政策、甚至日本之極端派、亦猶豫不決、無敢冒險與美國立即開戰者、但日人尙妄冀在更有利條件下、採取進步行動、所謂更有利之條件、即希特勒在歐之春季攻勢、獲「可能的」成功、乃中國　內部衝突而减弱實力、日本現正千方百　、　求　到此種目的、</p>
<p>造作蜚語聳動觀聽</p>
<p>松岡此行、無非欲獲知希椅勒之用意、尋求此軸心領袖之援助、及設法聯絡蘇聯而已、同時日本巳覺察征服中國、實為不可能之事、蓋因中國人民巳決心作戰到底、而美國對中國之援助、亦有增無已、故日本正在陰謀國共磨擦之擴大、日本報紙對記載「國共磨擦問題」、均言過其實、甚至造作蜚語、謠傳重慶已定下軍事計劃、掃蕩延安之共黨根據地、並謂何應欽將軍將任討共總司令等荒謬之詞、</p>
<p>陰謀成就卽行開戰</p>
<p>日本夢想利用重慶之守舊份子、取得妥協、以為若此則中國又將發生內戰、而無法繼續對日作戰、屆時英美將失去一「同盟國、」而不得不停止援華、日本殆希望完成此種陰謀、然後與美國作戰、吾等僑居中國之外人、實有使各本國內中國友人、獲知事實眞相之必要、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米稍受旺到影響　囤虎銀根周轉不無棘手</h3>
<p>洋米來滬源源不斷、太古公司四川輪、前日傍晚到滬、由香港裝來一萬七千三百七十一包、昨日華綸洋行經理之法輪Albert　Sarrant號由西貢運來碎米二千八百噸、計二萬六千九百七十一包、昨晨抵埠停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、又法公司達得南號郵船、亦於昨午到滬由西　運來洋米七萬餘包、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、祖）</p>
<p>米市既以洋米旺到、而貼價　高、審銷得此機會、不無稍事觀望、而數日間新到已卸待卸各米總計不下近二十萬包、核其米款銀根計有二千萬左右之鉅、加之四行停業、周轉無前此之易、一般浮多散囤因實力不足、莫不急於隨市脫手、故早市開價即見猛落、旋以供多銷細、市乃續跌、惟午後價跌、引起本客添辦與補空、且謠言利於買方、故晚收略形挺站、計小絞巳自三千六七百元跌至三千三百元中、中關僅貼三千一百元、一號西貢高自三千二百元跌至二千九百元、决至二千六七百元、二號西貢自三千三四百元、跌至三千元左右、碎尖貼二千二三百元、他如暹羅火絞悉未能開出、總之較前巿貼盤猛甩五六百元不等、每担計落四五元之巨、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨仍屬不多、而買賣雙方心思、因洋米巿猛甩、均見轉餒、所以銷塲旣懈、售意亦鬆、各價續難立足、繼貶二元左右、常幫斛見特白粳開百二十三四元、普通百二十元、崑山斛見白粳高自百十八元、决至百十一元、靑角斛見薄稻百十二元、百十一元半、原包為十六元、</p>
<p>糯米際此環境、應亦同受牽制、貨主在急於求脫之下、巿價並即猛甩三四元不等、開杳港白元高自百零五元决至百零一元、糯茶九十五元、决全八十七八元、</p>
<h3>粉市前途　將惟坎粉是瞻</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日洋粉巿况、續見鬆落、蓋以國外來源踵接、除澳洲粉　由香港轉來綜計十萬包外、今明尙有坎粉二十餘萬包抵埠、業內人心、莫不看小、惟外幫囤戶收買尙多、花鳥鐘樓牌澳粉、因包子常有破碎、且存貨漸少、不受投機者歡迎、價巳跌至二十九元二角、比前猛小一元、金龍牌坎粉一度跌進二十九元關內、旋以散戶趁低吸收、價乃回站二十九元關口、其價已與澳粉相並立、若照粉質而論、相差的須一元左右、而目下進戶方面、貪其包子完整、及存到兩充、竟作為投機籌碼也、聞坎粉定貨共有一百萬包以上、故今後洋粉市塲、當以坎粉為前提云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日平靜逾恒、査國內外來源均寂、各粉廠原料、毫無依恃、日廠收買、亦屬隨時而取、概非正常態度、聞目下高杜麥市塲喊價已達五十元、而日廠收進者、價約四十五六元、偶有零星點綴而巳、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油外強內荏</h3>
<p>昨日豆油巿面、晨初開盤、先承上日之疲、會跌元譜、入後因滙水關係、成本昂砌、貨戶一味扳售、致期貨又冉冉上騰、結果較前市漲起三四元、現貨祗升半元左右、廠油則反落半元、故大局仍處實銷不振、不免外强內弱、計成交大有廠油二百担、價為一百零二元、大連油一百桶、價為一百三十八元五角、叉訂四月上交三千桶、價為一百三十六元五角至四十元零二角半、訂叫月下交一千桶、價為一百三十八元七角半至四十三元、花生油被人心帶起二三元、做開膠州油一百五十件、價為一百十八元至二十元、烟台油五十件、價為一百十三元五角又聽裝油二百聽價為一百五十六元、及江北本坊聽油三千聽、價為一百五十二元、今日有豆子一千三百七十五包、豆餅二百片、運新加坡、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯　買意復濃</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌勿動、英美匯暗市、晨間潛勢鬆動、午刻忽形轉軟、乃初有利空傳說、如美國古利致羅斯福總統之報吿、主張積極援華及美國凍結南斯拉夫資金、且聞斯時某行塞出美匯四十萬兀、市面遂吿鬆至三辦士二三四三七五及五元三一二五、後本埠忽有利多謠言、激起扒風、華行投機家互結、遂緊至三辦士二〇三一二五及五兀二五、牧盤結果反緊〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、期貨則均無軒輊、</p>
<p>早市一度鬆馳</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條勿動、紐的銀價及倫敦生金呆平、匯兌英對美對滬均平、美對英縮、　五、對滬長二分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士二一八七五、美匯五元二八一二五、較隔昨均無榮辱、開後外行賣意尙濃雖日銀行前來吸收、但聞「某行」力塞三月期美匯四十萬元、故市勢則吿鬆動、計日行吸收有利某行現美匯五元三一二五、及四月期美匯五元二八一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦平、此　交易小多、市况乏變、斯時現先令三辦士二三四三七五、現　匯五元三一二五、均可購結、如是　至午刻、因謠傳利多、加之華行與投機商忽萌買　、市勢由鬆轉軟、計做開三四月份美匯均吿五元二五、迨收盤現期英均吿三辦士二〇三一二五、美俱為五元二五、結果比上日現貨英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇三一二五、期貨英美匯則均榮辱不分、午後週三無市、</p>

<p>香港二十六日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、各匯概無變動、（申匯現貨昨日收降至四百六十五元）、九時三十五分吿平、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為二十四元半、十一時三十分吿平、各匯概無榮辱、午收吿平、申匯現貨上升七角五分、為四百六十五元七角五分、下午週三無巿、</p>

<h3>金市反跌為漲　現金交易轉盛</h3>
<p>咋日金巿烚赤暗盤、續跌後忽起漲風，復出六千六百元大關外、各方人心由疲轉恍忽、乃初承上日頹勢、更聞美使寇利之向維斯福總統之報吿書、主張積極援助中國、且聞美國又凍結南斯拉夫資金、外滙　鬆、價在銀號滙票商之賣風中、銳落見六千五百三十五元低價、不意外滙所鬆有限、證券幫金號　兌業來收吸、更有極端無稽利多傳說、當午刻漲勢突銳、竟哄達六千六百二十五元、終反跌軋漲五十二元、半日交易三四萬兩、下午週三無市、掉期（三月轉入四月）仍由賣方貼出予買方五十元、現金交易轉　、明豐出中異一百　、無期交價高二百四十元、繼又做十兩、高二百三十元、　記出中　七十兩、高二百二十元、德孚出祥　永一百兩、亦高二百二十元、二百兩高二百十元、後二百元有賣戶、比上日軋升僅十數元飾金關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤回升五十餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市即低十八元、計六千五百五十元、益大成記來進、開後一剎那升至六千五百九十七元、及聞外滙帶鬆、四月美金五元三一二五或可結、且銀號幫恒記、天元來力售滙票商大豐爭出、散空活動猛撳、價遂步降六十餘元、退至六千五百卅五元、時為仁承永、益大收吸、當見回上、及聞利多傳說、外滙亦轉軟、人心一振、義元順元證券幫力進、散空見勢不佳、急起傾補遂在買風中步升九十元突出六千六百元外、達六千六百廿五元、恒記售出至六千六百十五元、正午收市六千六百二十元、比上日牧價復升五十二元、照四月美金五元二五結價、為六千六百三十三元三角、計　十三元三角、收後做過六千六百三十元、上半日有九十元上落、下午塲外價在六千六百二十五元左右、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤（期交）價高二百二十元、收進比售出價低七八十元、現標金無價、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金兌價小動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、未更、大同行及新同行均仍掛七百元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>美票又有向上勢</h3>
<p>咋日外幣市况、烚赤市價、盤旋趨漲、英美金鎊因亦各漲一元、英金票呆定如故、巿價站平、美金票步趨漲勢、晚市高至上八元八角四分、比上日軋漲一角二分、香港票需要不稀、市價挺漲、日金票漲風已戢、晚巿略退為、一元一角一分、朝鮮票供求均勻、巿價站平、晚巿仍為站一元七角三分臘盤、</p>
<h3>證券　公債市況平穏</h3>
<p>公債　盤、昨日市況一度興奮、仍　泡影、所　消息均屬不確、金融情形、稍稍發生問題、是以市價極為恍惚、忽升怱降、但　面人心大都仍在做多、一時尙不易無小、昨日交易仍未見旺、不過信孚同康及恒康交易雖不多、但上下午均在　鱸收盡、餘如一興怡泰亦均在補回、賣戶上午祇三開益記震康、午後聯和多頭出　、為數較　、大通永孚亦均餓賣出、市價乃由高而下，結果祇甲乙兩種略好、餘均毫無上落、成交總數不過一百五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股一百股、價為十九元五角、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日（週二）電今日中國外債及遠東英商公司股票掛牌行市、均吿平滯、行情概無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗廠推銷雙馬　外棧與廠單價　竟相差百元</h3>
<p>紗市仍在迴旋之境、絕鮮榮辱可分、目前市塲上之陣容、多空兩方對峙、雙方皆有相當的力量、等待變化後再決雌雄也、至於廠方為求出淸存貨起見、如果裝運外埠、價格依然特別遷就、所以雙馬外棧與廠單之售價、仍相差百元左右、於是一部份傾向拋賣、但多頭方面之理論、謂以後下去、原料不得鬆落、而不能下跌、二十支雙馬高價為一千四百〇　元，低價一千三百八十八元、午後初做一千四百〇二元、旋後為一千四百〇三四元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開承上日午後之處風續進、且塲上賣氣甚熾、首盤價為一千四百元、少頃跌至一千三百九十五元，此盤稍見迴旋、後聞金市平平，　至一千三百八十八元、在九十元關外甚久、迨至收盤時、因標金復升、人心重振、空頭抵補、市盤徐徐上升至一千四百〇四元收盤、査　日間成交統計八千一百六十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港六〇同行八、一〇〇統計八、一六〇</p>
<h3>印棉續有到滬</h3>
<p>現棉情况、又復平平無特色、以廠方現紗售價仍屬不振、所以對於購辦原料心意淡泊、惟同業中大都尙在望上、昨日做開共計一千件又一千〇五十包、價人一元許、茲錄現棉行市如左、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因南方幫套賣及多頭了結而疲、後因空頭抵補稍有回漲結果收盤價格、較之上日的跌二磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉巾、先因棉商套賣、及當局賣出而跌、旋因各戶分散買進回漲、後因大衆了結再跌、各方奮力支持再漲、最後仍因多頭　行了結而跌、昨日收盤價格、竟低落六至十一羅比不等、又預測今日開盤甚平、並無多大漲落、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、仍為各同業間互相販賣之局面、廠方購意較呆、唯市况尙堅定、印棉及巴西棉皆有小額成交也、</p>
<p>印棉繼續到滬、太古公司四川輪前日傍晚到埠、由香港轉運來滬、印棉一千一百件、昨已起卸完竣、（祖）</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布先跌後回</h3>
<p>廠布昨市先跌繼回、趨勢仍緊、客銷零星、同業及囤戶搜持、廠盤亦無鬆意、浮戶多額雖有轉賣、市面影響甚微、晨市怡和粗布同業訂價續漲每疋二角半、富貴細希晨開四十四兀、較上日跌五角、午後回至四十四元二角半、結果各牌細布斜紋跌每疋一角至二角半、本街成交各布五百餘件、浙閩幫辦粗細布色布色斜一百餘件、粵港幫新採辦甚稀少、裝貨仍旺、今日有疋頭八十件、運新加坡、又六十件運香港、又六件運庇能、</p>
<p>東布市氣平穩、白貨細布跌一二角、細斜漲二角半至五角、十二磅龍頭細布老棧單四十八元五角、新單四十八元九角，四君子嗶嘰收盤價每碼一元四角一分半、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖水腳再加二成　劃盤初疲後緊</h3>
<p>昨糖巿初因囤戶售出、稍有鬆落、旋據荷蘭電訊、來貨水脚又須增加二成、因此成本隨高、價乃復漲、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧八十五元、外棧八十四元三角、五角、旋升至八十五元、至八十五兀二角、五角、三月底打單八十五元、五元半、六元一角、升一元一角、四月十日打單八十五兀四角、六元、六元半、四月二十日打單八十六元、六元半、七元、荷赤微緊為六十七元半、升二角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十七元、升四角、東棧八十六元八角、DY嘜八十二元半、HX嘜八十二元、升度相仿、本一號冰因原料步升、亦升二元、為一百〇九元、晶明冰一百十元、昨由香港來糖三百八十五包、</p>
<h3>本市存糖略增</h3>
<p>本市食糖、到銷雙方俱見活動、査存底如粗白及生砂碗靑等，均見稍减、惟太車白B嘜及車赤H嘜則均有增加、結果總存　比前又增七、八四三包，茲將各糖詳誌如右、</p>
<p>粗白棉白一二七、八九四</p>
<p>荷赤一八、五二七</p>
<p>生碗碗靑七、六二七</p>
<p>太古車白B一七、九九〇</p>
<p>太古車白CX一八〇</p>
<p>太古車白DY六、二八〇</p>
<p>又HX一五、〇三九</p>
<p>古車白HM一、八九五</p>
<p>又車赤H七、七四七</p>
<p>共計二〇三、一七九件</p>
<h3>南北貨　府紅再升二元</h3>
<p>府紅棗凶到存俱稀、惟各方去化頗形活躍、故市價一再步聚、昨市鄒縣府紅售五十元、濟南府紅四十八元、比前又升二元、申市旣一再上展、產價漸就接近、後貨當有續到云、</p>
<h3>紅米騰漲</h3>
<p>紅米因來源吿乏、而存底本薄、叉値近日南洋天津等幫去化頗為活動，故此市價迅速上展、昨巿較高之貨、叫升四五十元不一、據業中人觀察、後市尙防再緊、蓋來源旣乏、而市存亦日就稀少玫也、</p>
<h3>五金　已無上市</h3>
<p>連上來五金市面、漫　目標的橫衝直撞、各貨市價在跳不已、而整個巿塲却陷於混亂　熊中、致標準價亦無一定之標準、一日間數易其貌者不足為奇、上午價與下午價相差亦甚可懼、故無準確之行情可誌、僅見逐日之新紀錄而已、査其原因、當不外為海外來源斷擋、本巿存底不豐、人心居奇所致、雖用戶幫及客幫亦有點綴、然究屬其欠、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤暗盤飛俏</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、近來銷塲雖已退化、但因四月份船隻尙未扣定、水脚如何、難以逆料、故經理行家巳停止現售、有行無市、祇老棧單點綴市塲、故暗盤飛俏、自在意中、咋日鴻基塊煤已喊三百三十元、尚無大批、故本街門荘、亦已掛上云、</p>

<h3>人生　一對信的啟示</h3>
<p>— 承浚</p>
<p>我生平只交過一個女友，而且我把她從悒鬱消極的陷阱中救活出來。我盡了世上最眞擎高尙的友愛，在我的生命史上是足够榮耀的。</p>
<p>那是一個年輕的女子，比我小一歲，是從前大學時候的同學。當我們畢業的那年，她的父親母親相繼見背，她忽忽的返故鄕金華料理喪事，叉忽忽的來上海參加畢業考試。一來一去，誰也沒有覺察到她心理的劇變。因為她是一個寡言多思的人，又加上那瘦弱的身子，所以在一級裹是不會級人注意的。　我呢，無論對那一個同學，都保待着相當的情感，但是我對她特別關切，不是另有所求，而實在是結了文字之緣。原來她文學天才極高，於詩小說獨長。我平常也歡喜欣賞和寫作道種　人視為雕虫小技的文學作品，不過我偏好尖銳精悍的雜感散文吧了。因為這緣故，所以我常和她交換寫作上的技巧，而我也知道她比任何人——除　她父母——都深切。</p>
<p>那年她父母的喪亡，使她成了孤女。她勉强應付了學校裏的考試。在考畢的第二天，當我們一級四十餘顆年輕的心正在舉行茶話會歡樂的時候，却不見她那纖弱的瘦影。我們都驚異着，恐怕她毀滅了自己。使得那天愉快的空氣陰沉沉的，大家都猜測着她可能的後果。但是我默默無言，因為我知道她無論如何會預先通知我的—當她毀滅自已或出走之前。我只期待着好的音訊。</p>
<p>次日的早上，果然接到了她的信，原來她準備流亡與飄泊，以度過這一生。她那樣悽離地寫着：「我的思潮的起伏，心緖的變化連目己都不能捉摸。我是一個弱者，我再也沒有力量來為生活而鬥爭，和環境相奮鬥。但願擺脫一切，讓這脆弱的生命快些結束，……朋友，願我們在這裹作一决最後的握手吧！我明天耍走了，到那裏去，自己也沒有決定，好在總是失了父母的浮萍，上昇，下沉，有誰顧及？……」我一字一字地讀着，我沒有驚異，因為這是她生活的境遇和脆弱的心靈，必然構成的人生態度啊！</p>
<p>但是我覺得我有拯救她的責任，我很冒昧地走到她的寓所。她正在管理行裝，我見了她那忙碌的情景，祇淡泊地打了個招呼，佇立在一邊。終於我首先開口，問她到底到那裏去，有沒有職務等問題。而她所回答的依舊是前决信上的那些話。不過似乎若有所求的多說出了一句：『如果在上海有職業的話，還想住下一二年，因為這裹還有許多年輕的友人。』『我一定給你想方法。』我說：「無論如何你要走也須待二星期後。」她答應了，我就毫無留戀地離開了她的寓所。</p>
<p>回家後，馬上寫了一封信給她：『……失了父母的人固然孤苦，但決不能說是孤獨。因為家庭是一個狹隘的囹圄，我們應走向廣大的社會去，似淘金者一息不停地淘取生活的精義。孤獨，苦難，是足以鍜鍊一個人生活的能力的。世界決不會永遠沉沒於陰霾的寒冬，和煦的春天將會來到……猶其灰冷苦痛地過一生，何如痛快熱烈地來過一世……朋友，你還年輕，我希望你能重新振作，過那有意義的生活。』同時，我在二星期內替她找了一個女子中學的國文敎席。她接受了我的介紹，在那裏過了一年半。而我還隨時鼓勵她寫作看書，以轉移她孤思的情緖。她呢，大半也能接受我的　吿，日積月累的積極起來。</p>
<p>上學期寒假中，她辭別我到福建去了。因為她從前父親的朋友的介紹，到那裏一家報館的文藝副刊做助理編輯。至前天才接到她的信。她說：『這裹雖然很忙，但都是我願意做的工作，所以很愉快。我現在和從前有兩個完全不同的人生態度。我得感謝你把我從煩悶的泥沼中救出。你才是我生平最眞摯的友人。……還願你多寫些關於上海的通訊寄來」</p>
<p>是的，她現在雖依舊是孤女，但不是厭世的孤女了。我拯救了她，我感覺到勝利的愉快。</p>

<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>「袁寳藩他有木領能够騙到我的身子，却不能騙到我的心，更不能使我忘記過去的一切！」羅湘綺的說話，漸漸顯得激昂悲憤起來。「我母親從發覺他的騙局的第二天起，病勢便沉得了，她一面痛恨他，一面又覺得太對不起我，便抵死不願再住在那邊，由我和父親把她送了回來，使她仍得在自己家裏嚥了最後一口氣。」雖然事情已過去了一年多，但湘綺一提到這件事，禁不住眼圈又紅了。</p>
<p>在這一節話裏，秋海棠實在覺得無法插嘴，只能繼續靜坐着傾聽。</p>
<p>「因為這所屋子是我母親瞑目的所在，而且我自己一生中所過的最愉快的日子，也都是在道裏過的，所以我決定仍把它保留着；甚至還利用了他的錢，全部修整了一下，所以看起來反比從前新得多了。」說着，湘綺臉上不覺叉浮出了一絲苦笑。「我父親也一直住在這裹，直到最近才帶了一筆錢，到南方去看我的哥哥。」</p>
<p>「袁鎭守使也常到……？」秋海棠開始想問，但又自覺太唐突，忙立刻嚥住了。</p>
<p>「他可從沒有來過。」綺却已知道他所要問的是什麽事了。「這也是我當着胡餐軍太太的面跟他講定的。他可以沾汚我的身子，却不能再沾汚我家的門庭！現在，這裏一切都和一年前一樣，每天靜悄悄地沒有一個來客，看家的也還是那個啞丫頭，當他小在天津的時候，我住在道裏的日子很多，我們的吃用衣着，都和從前毫無改變：只是我這一個人，却巳永遠不是淸白的女孩兒了……。</p>
<p>說到這一句，湘綺的聲音已變得非常的酸楚，使秋海棠聽了，馬上從心底裏　起了一陣憐惜和悲憤的情緖。</p>
<p>他把一手支着下頷，一眼不霎的看着湘綺的臉，差不多有五分鐘沒有移動他的視綫；湘綺也像沒有覺察一樣，儘自望對面牆上的幾幅字畫看着，不覺彼此都看出了神。（六五）</p>

<p>世界著名作家摩姆（W.S.Maugham）告訴我們說：讀科學與哲學的書籍，應該在早上還沒餓開始工作之前，因為這兩門東西都需要一個較新鮮，較集中的頭腦。後來，當你的工作完結後，覺得有點兒乏了；在這個時候。最好是讀些歷史，評論與傳記等類的書籍。讀小說的時間，該留在晚上。除此之外，你可以再備幾本詩集，以便隨時隨地有偶然的興歡發生時，加以欣賞</p>
<p>他們叫我們該養成讀書的習慣。書本能够幫助我們解決許多在人生途上可能遭遇到的難題。（譯自摩姆原著的書一書）</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>二李之爭李萬春與李少春之爭，過去稱之為二李之爭。現在所說之二李之爭，不是指萬春與少春之爭，是說李萬春與李洪春之爭。原因是因為去歲李萬春去滬，未能與洪春偕行，洪春本為萬春班中之中堅份子，自此洪春乃棄萬春而與武生李盛斌合作，專演萬春所演之諸戲。迨萬春北返，見洪春有意和他挑戰，於是亦不甘示弱，乃與李盛斌李洪春大打對臺。李洪春排演十本「鐵公鷄」，李萬春排演二十本「鐵公鷄」，現在在雙方對峙下，李洪春方面之「鐵公鷄」，巳排到「第四十大本」，演員除主角李盛斌外，復有戲曲學校之賀玉欽，及李萬春之老搭擋毛慶來。按李萬春去歲南來，毛慶來並未同行，但萬春對外宣稱，則謂毛在平主持彼所主辦之鳴春社科班，無暇南來，實則毛李間巳失和。毛除加入萬春之敵方李少春之班外，今復與李盛斌李洪春合作，此無疑對萬春示威。觀此情形，可知毛李二人，勢難重歸於好矣。</p>
<p>諸伶行踪最近舊都巳無好戲可聽，原因是諸大名伶相繼去外埠出演，程硯秋去靑島，荀慧生去上海，馬連良去濟南，譚富英去天津，言菊朋去南京，現在平出演者，除尙小雲金少山奚嘯伯諸班外，餘均坤角，或莫明其妙之人物，情形殊不十分景氣也。</p>

        <h1>1941.03.27</h1>
<h3>President Roosevelt Firmly Declares: The United States Will Support China; New Plans to Aid [Allied] Nations Will Be Announced Upon Return from Trip; Corley Suggests Assisting China with Flying Fortresses</h3>
<p>Washington – After returning to the United States from his tour of China's Free Areas, Corley submitted a report to President Roosevelt. Although its release was delayed, newspapers have now decided to disclose some of its contents. Corley is known to be one of President Roosevelt’s aides, a man of few words, and not considered a military expert, but rather a reliable reporter. According to reports, Corley brought back a list detailing China's various needs for counterattacking Japan. In terms of modern warfare, this list can be considered extremely simple. According to Corley, China needs fewer than twenty Flying Fortresses, two hundred new-style fighter planes, some aviation gasoline and steel weaponry, and some artillery and ammunition. With these, China would be sufficient to drive back Japan. It is said that Corley advocates that the United States adopt a bold diplomatic approach. Rumor has it that Corley believes the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been resolved, and that China has confidence in ultimate victory. Corley himself also believes that the Japanese cannot blockade the Burma Road. It is said that Corley pointed out the following two points to demonstrate the effectiveness of China's future counteroffensive: (1) The Japanese military strength in China is exhausted, and its morale is declining, a situation far worse than Washington knows. (2) Flying Fortresses can drop incendiary bombs on Japan's paper-and-wood industrial concentration areas, delivering a physical blow to Japan's war effort. If the above suggestions are true, it is currently unknown to what extent the authorities will adopt them. However, the President has indeed formally and firmly declared that he will support China. It is a well-known habit that the President returns with plans he has formulated shortly after each trip. Therefore, it would not be surprising if the President returns one day with new plans to aid China and other nations. After all, the Lend-Lease Act was announced after the President returned from a fishing trip. Advocates here for a bolder policy in the Pacific are gaining ground due to the US fleet's visits to New Zealand and Australia. Conservative elements in the naval community had previously predicted that US warships venturing west of the 180th meridian would be attacked or driven back by the Japanese. Now, many here believe that if the US fleet were to visit Singapore this time, it would be enough to deter Japan from coveting Malaya. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>War Spreads Across Europe and Africa Due to Delayed Aid to China; Lord Lytton Issues Justifiable Argument</h3>
<p>London – Lord Lytton, writing in the Manchester Guardian, stated: "We are pleased to hear President Roosevelt's remarks that China will receive various forms of American aid in its heroic resistance. If we had given China more aid in 1932, would we have seen Hitlerism rise in Germany, or the war spread to Europe and Africa? All the actions and methods of the two European thugs we are fighting today were first used by the Asian thug, Japan, such as starting wars without declaration, calling wars of aggression wars for peace, feigning friendship to conceal war preparations, inciting disturbances in neighboring countries to justify restoring order and armed intervention, forcibly occupying other countries' territories while claiming to have no territorial ambitions, and establishing puppet governments in false alliances. All of these were invented by Japan. However, from 1931 to 1933, few people understood the disastrous consequences that the world's passive acquiescence to this new form of aggression would bring. Now, after more than a decade of continuous warfare, the spirit of the Chinese people has not been dissipated. The sacrifices made by China have stimulated the Chinese people to develop an unprecedented national unity in their history. European nationalism was promoted by Napoleon, while Chinese nationalism was promoted by Japan. Japan will be destroyed by what it has promoted, just like Napoleon." (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>US and Netherlands Discuss Supply Issues; Dutch Representative to Visit Australia</h3>
<p>Washington – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter, who arrived here from England last week, have been in contact with US government officials for a long time regarding the issue of the US supplying defense equipment. Both plan to visit Batavia and Australia before returning to England. The outcome of their trip will certainly further adjust the prospects for joint defense by Australia and the Netherlands in the Pacific. Both are scheduled to take a clipper from San Francisco to Manila within this week, and then transfer to Batavia. According to Welter, the Dutch East Indies plans to ship large quantities of tin and rubber to the United States. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Dutch Foreign Minister's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>New York – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens broadcast here today, saying that since January of this year, the production of US military aircraft has increased ninefold, and by June this production will increase fifteenfold compared to January. President Roosevelt assured him that he is determined to see the Netherlands restored as an independent nation. The only thing that cannot be determined at present is when victory can be achieved. However, he firmly believes that the Dutch, like the British, will have the strength to persevere to the end, and are constantly working hard to prepare for the future of rebuilding on the ruins created by Germany, so as to immediately supply the Netherlands with relief goods after the war. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Lithuania Decides to Move Capital</h3>
<p>Vichy – The Vichy News Agency received a Moscow dispatch stating that Lithuania's capital will be moved from Kaunas to Vilnius. This was decided by the Lithuanian government. The capital relocation is expected to be completed before September 1. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Imports Gasoline from the United States; Seven Times More Than Last Year</h3>
<p>London – War Minister of the British Government, Lord Dorington, declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the British and American governments were engaged in discussions regarding Japan's increasing import of gasoline from the United States. He stated that this gasoline, when mixed with tetraethyl lead, could be transformed into gasoline suitable for aviation use. This situation could naturally undermine the United States' ban on the export of aviation gasoline to Japan. According to experts, Japan's gasoline imports from the United States in August 1940 were seven times greater than in the same period in 1939. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Matsuoka Arrives in Berlin Last Night; German-Japanese Conference to Begin Immediately; US-Japan Confrontation and Military Issues Will Occupy Important Place in Discussions</p>
<p>Berlin – German Radio reported that Matsuoka will arrive in Berlin at 6:00 PM today. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrived at Makinija, Germany, last night with his entourage. The German government dispatched Ambassador Stahmer, Stormtroop Leader Teng Jia, and Colonel Marski to welcome him. Matsuoka is expected to arrive in Berlin today. Streets here are decorated with flags to welcome him. The Japanese Foreign Minister will stay here for five days, holding consultations with government officials. He will be received by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop tomorrow, followed by an exchange of views between Hitler and Matsuoka. The Japanese Foreign Minister is also scheduled to meet with Economic Minister Dr. Funk and Air Force Minister Marshal Goering. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – News emerged here yesterday that after Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrives in Berlin, he will immediately hold a meeting with German leaders. The content will include Japan's confrontation with the United States in the Far East, or even the establishment of a new agreement with Berlin. Matsuoka arrived in Berlin by train this morning. This is the initial decision for the Japanese Foreign Minister to visit Berlin. According to reliable German spokespersons, the Japanese Foreign Minister's decision to visit is actually based on the belief that the Axis powers will win against the United States passing the Lend-Lease Act. Matsuoka's trip before Yugoslavia joined the Axis represents the climax of the Axis's spring diplomatic offensive. When the Japanese side announced the visit to Berlin, authoritative circles made two important statements: (1) Military issues will occupy an important place in the discussion. (2) Germany and Japan may use this opportunity to sign some new agreements. Japanese sources here believe that Matsuoka is eager to know what kind of military and other assistance Japan will receive from the Axis powers if it comes into conflict with the United States by adopting a "hard-line policy in the Far East." In short, all German comments believe that military and diplomatic applications will occupy an important place in future talks. There is also much speculation here, expressing doubts about what kind of treaty Japan and Germany will sign. As for the German islands that Japan is currently temporarily administering, whether they will be on the agenda is unknown. The German side declined to comment. The German side believes that this visit has a "demonstrative" significance. Some diplomatic circles here also believe this to be true. German newspapers also published Matsuoka's visit with a prominent position, believing that Matsuoka's meeting with German and Italian military and political leaders is of great importance. In any case, the German government is making great efforts to welcome Matsuoka. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels publicly stated to the Berlin public last night that welcoming Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is a manifestation of German-Japanese friendship. All factories in Berlin will close at 2:00 PM today so that workers can have the opportunity to welcome the Japanese Foreign Minister. German newspapers also stated that Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima issued a statement as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka was about to arrive in Berlin, elucidating German-Japanese cooperative relations, believing that Germany and Japan not only have no political disputes, but also have a common goal of building a new order in the crumbling old world. The conclusion of the Tripartite Pact has increased the strength of the Axis powers. Countries with the same attitude have joined the Tripartite Pact. The Japanese Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin at a time of international tension is of great significance. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will arrive in Rome on the 31st of this month. It is said that he will stay for three days and return to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>London – German radio broadcast that the Vatican has confirmed that the Pope will receive Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka during his visit to Rome. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Italian Ambassador to Japan Indiri visited Foreign Minister Ohashi today to discuss the international situation, saying that the relationship between Japan and Italy lasted for about half an hour. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Britain Leases Base to the US; Agreement to Be Signed Today</h3>
<p>London – According to official announcement, the agreement to lease the Atlantic base to the United States will be signed in London tomorrow. The British representatives will be Prime Minister Churchill, Lord Cranborne, and Lord Moan. The US representatives will be US Ambassador to Britain Winant and three members of the US Technical Committee. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>US Orders Cargo Ships According to Plan; First Batch to Be Launched This Year; Also Signs Ship-Building Agreement with Canada; Martin Asks All Americans to Devote Themselves to National Defense</p>
<p>Washington – The Shipping Commission, in accordance with President Roosevelt's plan to build 200 merchant ships, has signed contracts worth more than US$205,000,000 to build 137 cargo ships. All will be manufactured using mass production methods. The first batch can be launched this year. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>New York – According to the Associated Press, the United States and Canada have signed an agreement allowing both countries to build warships on the Great Lakes. (Tass, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – Republican National Executive Committee Chairman Martin resigned recently, but after the party cadres worked hard to retain him, he decided to continue to be responsible. He gave a speech today, saying, "National security and our future depend on whether the country has a brave, intelligent, and constructive opposition party. I believe that no true American wants to see the country politically unified in a way that destroys the two-party government system. But at this time, all citizens, whether Republican, Democrat, or independent, must devote themselves to national defense, ensuring that the country can stand invincible against any attack." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – Knudsen, Director of the Manufacturing Bureau of the National Defense Committee, spoke at the Senate, strongly stating that once American industry has completed its preparations, its total production can be doubled. At present, there are about two million people in the country working for national defense. It is expected that this number will increase to three million by the end of the summer. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>US Defense Officials Monitor Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>Washington – Defense officials today are paying attention to two major strike waves and a major labor conference. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Bertram – There was a riot due to labor disputes at the Bertram Steel Company in Pennsylvania, causing injuries to many police officers. Action has been taken. The state guard has been ordered to assemble and guard all the entrances to the steel plant. It is reported that the company's factory is currently not working. However, the company announced that its output still reaches 70% of normal. The strike was launched by the steel workers of the Industrial Organizations Committee to protest the actions of other labor unions not belonging to the committee. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Dynamics of the Balkans</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the European war has not seen major military developments in the Balkans. The Greco-Italian War has so far been only a local war and has not yet merged with the main forces between Britain and Germany. Germany's management of the Balkans, although relying on military force as a threat, has not yet taken any large-scale war actions. At the same time, the advances and retreats, intrigues, and power struggles of both belligerents and third countries in this area are more profound than anywhere else, and the intricate complexity of international diplomatic relations also constitutes a spectacle in this corner. In the most recent two or three days, Yugoslavia's alliance and the reaffirmation of the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression declaration have shown that the diplomatic and political operations of the belligerents and related countries in this area have reached their maximum extent, and will also exert a decisive and epoch-making significance for the body of the European war.</p>
<p>For more than half a year, Germany has adopted an offensive in the political and economic aspects of its management of Southeastern Europe, while maintaining a defensive arrangement in military terms. From the Danube basin to the Balkan Peninsula is Germany's rear force, and also an important warehouse for it to obtain fuel, food, and various materials. On the other hand, because Britain, Greece and Turkey stand on the tip of the Balkans, and are separated by sea from Britain's Near East military base, and are the most convenient route for the British army to attack Germany. Therefore, after the Western European war gradually stalled last autumn, Germany turned to the east to develop, forcibly placing those helpless small and medium-sized countries under its iron fist. This was no accident, as Hitler had his own important basic reasons: first, to avoid the war affecting the Danube basin and the Balkans; second, to avoid sharply stimulating the Soviet Union. The former focuses on economic requirements, and the latter on political factors; but in the final analysis, they are both to avoid the danger of fighting on two fronts, so as to focus on dealing with Britain on the Western Front. On this point, Hitler's achievements have had a considerable effect, but in the course of factual development, those two beliefs cannot be achieved at the same time. Italy's invasion of Greece was already the prelude to a major war in the Balkans; although Hitler tried his best to calm down and restrain himself, and only used his military coercion under the standard of peace to make countries such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia submit, he could not absolutely guarantee that the fire of war would not cross the Balkan Mountains and spread northward. The rumored attack on Greece has not been realized for a long time, and the reason for it may lie in this. If Hitler were as reckless and hasty as Mussolini, the Romanian oil fields and the Bulgarian food warehouse would inevitably become sacrifices under the British air force. As for the Soviet Union and Germany, Nazi operations have always regarded maintaining good neighborly relations of non-aggression with the Soviet Union as a supreme and important condition. The Soviet Union's past military advances into Poland, operations against Finland, the merger of the three Baltic states, and the retrieval of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, were all ignored by Germany, as it gradually restored its tsarist-era hegemony in the Baltic Sea and territory in Eastern Europe. But on the other hand, Germany's entry and exit into Southeastern Europe finally aroused the Soviet Union's increasing vigilance; and the closer German forces approached the Bosporus Strait and the Aegean Sea, the gates of the Black Sea, the more the Soviet Union could not suppress its aversion. Bulgaria's joining the Axis, the Soviet authorities had already begun to announce their disagreement with German military actions; to Yugoslavia joining the Axis, it even changed its consistent attitude of preventing Turkey from assuming obligations to Britain, and encouraged the Turkish authorities to resist aggression with goodwill and neutrality. This is a warning to Germany, a demonstration against Yugoslavia's accession; to Britain, its objective significance is actually no different from the unprecedented expression of friendship in the past two years. If the German army continues to advance south, even if only targeting Thrace or Salonica, those who are familiar with Turkey's intentions will hardly sit idly by and not resist, let alone the German side further peep at the straits.</p>
<p>Hitler's management of Southeastern Europe has been fully successful to this point, with the exception of Greece. However, as a result, on the one hand, the Danube River basin and the entire Balkans are on the brink of war, and on the other hand, the rift between the Soviet Union and Germany has become superficialized. If he takes another step forward, he will inevitably encounter greater aversion and resistance. Comparing the two, which gains and losses are greater, we do not want to draw conclusions rashly, and even Hitler cannot but give this more serious consideration. Invading Asia Minor from the Balkans to peep at Britain's oil fields and the Suez Canal, although strategically significant, must take advantage of the opportunity of discord between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Britain to be able to succeed. Now that Britain and Turkey have an alliance, and the Soviet Union and Turkey have just demonstrated their common stance with a declaration, then even if the Nazis originally had such an attempt, they must now stop due to the existence of this new international factor. As for surrounding Greece and coercing negotiations, although it may also be one of Hitler's goals in the east, it cannot represent the entire significance of his management of the Balkans, because to deal with a small peninsula country, Hitler would never regard it as necessary to spend so much effort, not to mention that his management of Southeastern Europe was far earlier than Italy's invasion of Greece; Mussolini's reckless advance into Greece, regardless of Germany's intentions, actually had the meaning of competing with Germany. If the British army landing in Greece at this moment is not prepared to launch a major war in the Balkans, then Germany's management to consolidate the rear and obtain resources, which began last autumn, will come to an end with Yugoslavia's final accession and the Soviet Union's statement of its attitude. Even if it is possible to continue to plot something against Greece, its nature and quantity are only the aftermath of taking advantage of the opportunity, and cannot be regarded as the original final goal of the German side. The future movements of the German side will likely shift to the United States and the Atlantic, as predicted by yesterday's international news.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle in Northern Jiangxi for Five Days; Japanese Troops Attacking Shanggao Repelled; Most of Japanese Troops Surrounded in Guanqiao and Sixi; Few Break Out and Retreat Eastward; Chinese Troops Pursue in Rain</h3>
<p>Chongqing – After fierce fighting throughout the 24th in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese troops east of Shanggao retreated in three routes that night. This was reported by a high-ranking military officer, who also explained that the victory in this battle was the most important victory this year. Since withdrawing from Wuning, the Japanese troops were deeply afraid of the Chinese troops attacking Nanchang, so they made a preemptive plan to attack west from Fengxin, attempting to eliminate the main force of the Chinese troops between Gao'an and Shanggao. After fierce fighting for days, the Chinese troops finally surrounded them in three places at noon on the 24th. In the afternoon, the Japanese side tried to airdrop supplies with more than 30 aircraft, but it was still ineffective. They finally collapsed at 8:00 PM. However, less than one-third of them escaped. In addition to clearing the battlefield, the Chinese troops were pursuing all night in the rain last night. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to war reports from northern Jiangxi received here, the battles there are extremely fierce, and the number of Japanese troops participating has reached tens of thousands. From the 15th to the 18th, the Japanese troops advanced rapidly, capturing Gao'an and other places in succession. Starting on the 19th, the Chinese troops deployed and began to counterattack. The Japanese troops also continued to attack with all their strength, obviously aiming at Shanggao. After days and nights of bloody fighting, the Japanese troops have not been able to achieve their goal. According to Chinese military sources, more than 5,000 Japanese troops were killed in this battle, and many were captured. The Chinese troops also captured more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, more than 800 rifles, and many other war trophies. On the 24th, the Japanese troops again sent reinforcements, making contact in the Guanqiao and Sixi areas east of Shanggao. After nine hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were cut into three sections and surrounded separately. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to semi-official sources, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Shanggao yesterday, they adopted the scorched earth policy commonly used by the Chongqing government. Shanggao is the main stronghold of the Chinese troops in the Ninth War Zone and the headquarters of the 19th Army Group. It was captured by the Japanese troops on March 23. After the Japanese troops burned Shanggao to ashes at night, they felt that there was no need to stay, so they began to advance to another new destination. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Zhangshu – The remaining Japanese troops who attacked Quanzhou Port Street have been intercepted by a certain unit for days and are retreating to the Jin River. The Chinese troops are tracking and pursuing them. (Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Japanese offensive in northern Jiangxi collapsed on Monday night after fighting hard for 30 hours under storm and rain. The Chinese troops tightened their encirclement of the attacking Japanese troops. But the Japanese troops broke through to the east. After casualties of 6,000 men, the Japanese finally escaped from the Chinese encirclement. On Monday noon, 38 airplanes were unable to effectively transport supplies to the surrounded Japanese troops, so the Japanese troops had to withdraw. The Japanese troops attacked Shanggao with mechanized units, but after fierce fighting, the Japanese troops ran out of ammunition and were surrounded. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – Official military intelligence stated that the Japanese troops in Guangdong Province have resumed operations. 2,000 Japanese troops, covered by aircraft, sailed up the Han River from Shantou to Huyang yesterday morning. Fierce battles are underway. Many Japanese troops have been killed and wounded. The Central News Agency stated that this is the first time the Japanese troops have advanced to Chaoyang since landing in Haifeng. The Chinese troops had long anticipated a Japanese attack on Chaoyang, because the area produces abundant rice and is only 40 miles from Shantou. The embroidery industry there is also very famous. Most of the goods exported from Shantou to the United States come from there. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Air Defense Association Launches Air Defense Donation Drive</h3>
<p>Chongqing, During the first Air Defense Day commemoration last year, the central government stipulated an air defense donation.

<h3>Berlin Announces Iceland Designated as a War Zone, Warns Neutral Nations of Navigation Dangers, U.S. Remains Silent For Now</h3>
<p>Berlin, The official gazette here announced last night that Iceland is now also included in the war zone for German operations against England. This is because British forces have illegally occupied Danish Iceland and are using it as a base. Therefore, Germany has no choice but to take this measure and include it in the war zone. Germany will not be responsible for any losses incurred by neutral ships entering the war zone announced by Germany. This was notified to all neutral countries on August 17, 1940, and that warning now also applies to Iceland. (Haitong, 26th)</p>

<h3>Patriotic Military and Civilians in Yugoslavia Indignant, Anti-Axis Demonstrations Erupt, Betraying Allies and Tainting Glorious History, Government Missteps May Trigger Internal Strife</h3>
<p>New York, The "New York Times" correspondent in the Yugoslav capital reports on the reaction to the signing of the Axis pact: The Yugoslav government has disintegrated amidst widespread popular indignation. Last night, officers and soldiers of the Yugoslav army were seen in groups in the streets of the capital, apparently staging a joint demonstration to protest the government's announced policy. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital, It was learned here yesterday that a large British force stationed in Greece has arrived at the Yugoslav border west of Salonika. A large part of the Yugoslav army, possessing one million troops, is likely to join the British forces. Widespread dissatisfaction has been expressed since three unknown Serbian representatives were appointed as cabinet members to replace the three who had resigned, so a new cabinet crisis is expected to erupt here. Anti-Axis demonstrations have erupted in Skopje, Kragujevac, and Cetinje. University students in Belgrade sang the national anthem and shouted anti-Axis slogans until their teachers intervened. There are fears that more violent acts may occur in various provinces of Yugoslavia, and some quarters even fear that they may trigger a civil war. Senior government officials said that before Yugoslavia joined the Axis, it had requested a firm guarantee from Britain for a certain number of aircraft and tanks, but the British response was vague and unsatisfactory, so Yugoslavia was forced to join the Axis. (International Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London, A patriotic organization in the Yugoslav capital recently distributed a large number of leaflets, stating, "We have reached the end of our patience. Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact will inevitably lead to the humiliation and death of the country and its people. Those who trifle with the lives of sixteen million people are in fact trifling with their own lives." Yesterday afternoon, all newspapers in the Yugoslav capital issued special editions announcing Yugoslavia's joining of the Tripartite Pact, with large-character headlines and prominently displaying the German and Italian assurances of respecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. "Politika" stated that this move provides Yugoslavia with an opportunity to peacefully continue strengthening its policy of loyal cooperation with its neighbors. However, this move is extraordinarily important both domestically and internationally, and unfavorable reactions are expected soon, but the beneficial effects of the pact will satisfy the general public. Last night, the Athens radio station explained the Greek reaction to Yugoslavia's signing of the pact. It was reported that Greek public opinion still cannot believe that Yugoslavia will betray its alliance of many years with Greece and its traditional friendship. Greek public opinion views the future with calmness, confident that the brave Serbian military and civilians will not tarnish their glorious history by harming the people of allied countries. The Turkish radio station broadcast last night that Yugoslav public opinion is quite dismayed, but its nature does not suggest that it will change the situation. The Yugoslav people are not mentally prepared to cope with the situation they now face. Yugoslavia's adherence to the Axis pact is tantamount to acknowledging in advance that Europe and Yugoslavia will be reorganized according to the Axis's wishes in the future. However, from the German point of view, Yugoslavia's signing of the pact should not be regarded as a move to stabilize the situation. The Moscow radio station simply reported Yugoslavia's signing of the pact without comment. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>London, Within hours of Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, the Germans showed their true intentions towards Yugoslavia. Last night's German radio broadcast announced the threat that Germany might enter Yugoslavia to restore order, stating roughly that German troops would not intervene as long as Yugoslavia did not experience unrest, but if there were rebellious actions hindering Germany, then Germany had sufficient troops to deal with them. According to reports received in London, the people of Yugoslavia are very indignant and shocked by the signing of the Tripartite Pact. This emotional surge has actually taken the form of open disturbances. After the announcement of the signing yesterday, the public held meetings and demonstrations. Reports of disturbances in many places across the country have already been received today. According to a Reuters dispatch from the Yugoslav capital, leaflets opposing the act of treason are being secretly distributed. The text in the leaflets reads, "We will not lay down our arms. We wish to maintain glory and freedom at any price." The Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister returned from Vienna this morning. Their return to the capital was more miserable than their departure for Vienna thirty-six hours earlier. There were no cheers, and no one waved the national flag to them. According to people here, the only Balkan countries not yet enveloped by the Axis sphere of influence are Greece and Turkey. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Romania's Example Serves as a Warning, Surrender Does Not Escape Enslavement</h3>
<p>London, The "Daily Telegraph" says that Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, in one word, has been bound and handed over to the Nazi thugs by a weak and incompetent government. The possibility of spontaneous rebellion, even at present, cannot be eliminated, and the most likely outcome of this move is that it will give Hitler a pretext to send troops into Yugoslavia to "restore order." The example of Romania is sufficient to prove that surrender does not escape enslavement, and the example of Greece is sufficient to prove that resolute resistance can gain honor amidst difficulties. The Yugoslav prime minister disregards both, just as he disregards the assurances that Britain has issued that it is by no means impossible to provide the most powerful assistance. The Yugoslav prime minister has now allowed his country to be disposed of by Germany and has stabbed its southern allies in the back. It is expected that when the Greek people are subjected to base attacks, they will be able to deal with them with the same bravery with which they defeated Mussolini in Albania. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Nazi Diplomatic Achievement in Yugoslavia, May Use Pretext to Interfere in Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>London, A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that Yugoslavia's joining of the Tripartite Pact is of little value in terms of the form of the agreement, but it has given the German side the opportunity to create a favorable situation, which is undoubtedly a diplomatic success for the German side. It seems that the conditions obtained by Yugoslavia in signing the pact under these circumstances are extremely generous, as its agreement does not contain the provisions of the Tripartite Pact regarding military matters. Moreover, the German side's right to transport freight cars carrying war materials and wounded soldiers through Yugoslavia is of little value at present, because since the Greek army is guarding the line to Salonika in the south, this line cannot be used for transportation. The railway line passing through Nis and reaching Plovdiv is an auxiliary to other means of transportation passing through Romania and the Danube River, so this line may not occupy an important position in the near future. However, the seriousness of Yugoslavia's joining the Axis lies in opening the door for the German side to interfere in its internal affairs. Since German trains are allowed to pass through Yugoslav territory, German officials will inevitably be sent to Yugoslavia to draw up a special train schedule according to the German side's wishes, and there is a risk that unexpected events will occur, giving the German side a pretext to tighten control. Yugoslavia has now embarked on a dangerous path of concession and will find that its actions are difficult to follow its own wishes, and it will feel the great significance of the British warning. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Returns Home From Vienna, Takes Measures to Prevent Riots</h3>
<p>Vichy, A Vichy news agency dispatch from the Yugoslav capital reports that the Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister will report on their trip to Vienna to Regent Prince Paul and the cabinet separately today and tomorrow. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital, Police and troops carrying machine guns and tear gas rushed to various parts of the country this morning to suppress various serious disturbances protesting Yugoslavia's adherence to the Tripartite Pact. The Yugoslav prime minister and foreign minister, who signed the draft in Vienna yesterday making Yugoslavia an ally of the Tripartite Pact, have returned to Yugoslavia and immediately implemented preventive measures. The capital is quiet, but many people believe that this quiet is a sign of a major riot. Many wealthy Yugoslavs have moved their families outside the capital for safety. However, the opposition does not seem to be fully organized and does not seem to have much strength, and most of its strength is concentrated within the province of Serbia. Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković returned here from Vienna after 7:00 a.m., disembarking at a suburban station, where Axis representatives and cabinet members welcomed them. The masses opposing adherence to the Axis lack a natural rallying point, that is, a leaderless mass, so a truly serious movement has not yet been realized. The German and Italian announcement that German troops will not enter Yugoslavia has deprived the opposition of its momentum, because the opposition's opposition to adherence to the Axis is based on this as a major point.

<h3>Soviet Union's Guarantee to Turkey Pleases the United States</h3>
<p>Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that it is pleasing to the United States that a powerful nation such as the Soviet Union has reiterated its intention to maintain its broad neutrality if a neighboring country is attacked. The United States has adopted an active diplomatic plan to persuade Yugoslavia to reject the demands of the Axis powers. People here generally believe that the Soviet Union's guarantee to Turkey is actually an unprecedented move. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>New York, The "New York World-Telegram" diplomatic correspondent says that the Soviet Union is concerned about Germany's control of the Dardanelles Strait, so it has reiterated its promise to Turkey. This guarantee is more powerful than it appears on the surface. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Views Turkey as China, Will Provide Assistance to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Ankara, The news circulating overseas that the Soviet Union and Turkey have recently reached an understanding stipulating that the Soviet Union will provide assistance if Turkey is attacked by Germany has not yet been confirmed here. What can be said at present is that if Turkey is attacked by Germany, then in the eyes of the Soviet Union, Turkey will not be regarded as engaging in a war of imperialism but rather as fighting to maintain its own independence. Therefore, Turkey may be regarded as being in the same position as China. The Soviet Union is one of the main suppliers of military supplies to General Chiang Kai-shek's government in its war against Japan. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Independence Day Celebrated Throughout Greece, British and American Telegrams Congratulate on Final Victory in the War of Resistance, Italian Army Counterattack in Albania Suffers Another Crushing Defeat</h3>
<p>Athens, Yesterday was the 121st anniversary of Greek independence. Towns and villages throughout Greece, as well as the front lines, celebrated with great joy. Their enthusiasm was not diminished by Yugoslavia's sale of its independence to Hitler in Vienna yesterday. In 1914, Greece gave up its neutrality for Yugoslavia. At the same time, patriotic citizens lined the streets of Athens to watch Prime Minister Koryzis lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Yesterday morning, the sun was warm, and King George of Greece, accompanied by his sister Princess Katherine (in a nurse's uniform), drove through the city streets fluttering with national flags to attend a thanksgiving prayer service in church. The prayer service was broadcast by radio to various military camps and hospitals. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

Roosevelt's reply stated that the methods used by the United States will enable free nations to fulfill their desire to improve the world. I believe that the Greek soldiers' will to victory will achieve its goal. (Haitong, 26th)</p>

<h3>Halifax's Speech: British War Aims - To Achieve Human Freedom and Re-Liberation, Assured of Victory with American Aid</h3>
<p>New York - British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, delivered a speech last night at a banquet held by the Holy Land Pilgrims Association, stating that Britain's war and peace aims are to achieve victory, prevent the recurrence of such tragedies, and help guarantee a just and common enjoyment of future prosperity. Halifax first praised the work of former British Ambassador Lothian in seeking Anglo-American understanding, and then stated that the closeness of the two peoples' thinking led to joint action against totalitarian dictatorship, which was further strengthened by the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Halifax pointed out that:</p>
<p>The Nazi System</p>
<p>is a method of enslaving people physically, mentally, politically, and economically. Halifax said that Hitler's New Order would divide the world's nations into two: one, the ruling Germanic people, and two, second-class citizens whose rights are determined by the ruling people. Hitler's ambition is not limited to Europe and now covets large tracts of land in Asia and Africa. If he gains hegemony in Europe, Hitler will not only invade Africa but will also quickly seize the Latin countries of South America, not allowing the Americas time to calmly build up their defenses, and will attack the Americas. Furthermore, the trading ports of Europe, Asia, and Africa will be closed unless they comply with the conditions set by the German side. In summary, if we say that the civilization we enjoy can still exist after the victory of Nazism, it is simply self-deception. We are concerned not only with material aggression but also with spiritual aggression. If we do not resist it, the harm of spiritual aggression will be more serious than the high-explosive bombs that the German Air Force can inflict on us. Therefore, we can never accept Hitler's New Order. Britain and the allied nations are making this life-and-death struggle for</p>
<p>Human Freedom</p>
<p>But if we cannot do everything humanly possible to ensure that the world does not suffer such a tragedy again, then even if victory is achieved, it will be like the result of the Dead Sea. When this great war ends in the future, all countries that maintain or restore their freedom will have an excellent opportunity to show what freedom means and what it contributes to human happiness. Although the future international structure cannot be fully elaborated at present, we can now see the foundation on which this structure will be built. All countries must be prepared to cooperate to seek their mutual overall economic well-being, and if necessary, to seek their mutual national defense. Only in this way can countries exist in freedom and security. In the economic sphere, everything depends on this kind of cooperation. However, no party must harbor the ambition to dominate other parties. All countries, large and small, will have their place and make their contributions. Past experience shows that a stable international order must accommodate the orderly changes in international relations. Individual freedom must take into account the needs of the community, and so must countries. Therefore, in the future, all countries must accept their obligations to the international community and be prepared to consider the well-being of their neighbors in political and economic terms. We are prepared to join hands with any country that faithfully fulfills its obligations and safeguards freedom within its borders, thereby seeking</p>
<p>World Peace</p>
<p>and prosperity. Any combination imposed on unwilling countries against their will is worthless. Therefore, we must find ways to create new political and economic conditions so that people can generate a true understanding of their common interests among themselves. The experience in the British Empire has shown that peoples with vastly different numbers, resources, races, and social structures can freely combine. Today, the British Empire is the cornerstone of world defense. In the future, the British Empire can be a ferry for world unity because our goal is the just and common enjoyment of prosperity. Even while fighting today, Britain is planning remedies to heal the wounds of the post-war era and is now storing food and war materials. This food can be made public when we know for sure that it will be used for healing rather than destruction. The reconstruction of post-war undertakings is a task that no one country can accomplish. Britain is determined to do its utmost, but the world's recovery depends on the joint action of all well-intentioned nations. If we cannot be sure of Germany's cooperation after the war, then what we can undoubtedly do is that countries determined to maintain peace and freedom must maintain sufficient armed forces so that their aspirations to maintain peace and freedom can be effectively realized. He hopes that the people of Britain and the United States understand their great shared responsibility in such matters; in other words, to unite justice and power so that their</p>
<p>Spirit of Cooperation</p>
<p>can win the support of other like-minded people to consolidate the foundation of world society so that Germany or any other country can no longer implement the policy of causing five wars in Europe in the past eighty years. The British ambassador then spoke about the Atlantic War, saying that in our experience, the enemy's attacks in the coming months may cause us significant losses, but our defense methods are very sound and only need to be developed with sufficient strength and speed. The coming months will see a competition between the total number of our ship losses and the increase in defensive weaponry that can reduce this number to a dangerous level. With the assistance that the United States can provide, we can undoubtedly win this competition. Some may ask if an invasion of Britain can succeed. He can resolutely answer that Britain's defenses are prepared, the morale of the British people is very strong, and the United States is providing generous assistance. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Forces Rapidly Advance in East Africa, 20 Miles from Harar; Change of Italian Generals to Change Strategy; German Mechanized Troops Appear in Libya</h3>
<p>Cairo - British troops in Abyssinia, advancing westward from Jijiga and passing through the recently captured Marda Pass, have reached a location within 20 miles of the key city of Harar. It is heard that the battle in that area is proceeding very smoothly. If Harar, which has no strong defenses, falls, the railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti and Dire Dawa (30 miles northwest of Harar) on that route will be severely threatened. It is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 Italian troops are stationed in Harar and Dire Dawa under the command of General Tesimoni. British troops in southern Abyssinia, starting from Neghelli, continue to advance north along the Italian-built highway towards Agin, so the threat to Agin is increasing daily. To the northwest of Agin, patriotic Abyssinian troops under Dejazmach Beyene Merid are in contact with 18,000 Italian and indigenous troops. Fierce fighting continues in the mountainous areas around Keren in Eritrea. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, observers here unanimously believed that the resignation of General Graziani, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, Governor of Libya, and Supreme Commander of the Italian forces in North Africa, indicates a new development in the Italian war in Africa. Sources close to the press claim that the lightning mechanized strategy used in Europe will replace the colonial tactics used by indigenous troops because Graziani is an Italian colonial tactician and is renowned for his ability to use colonial troops to traverse mountains. After Graziani's resignation, General Roatta was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army. He is a close friend of Mussolini and attended the Franco-Italian armistice agreement. At the same time, General Gariboldi was appointed Governor of Libya and Commander of North Africa. He is the most authoritative modern tactician in the Italian Army. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Yesterday, a British motorized reconnaissance unit in the eastern part of the Sirte Desert in North Africa encountered a German detachment transporting supplies to the base of the German-Italian forces. As a result, the British army was defeated by the German army. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Cairo - British General Headquarters here announced that a certain "enemy unit" has occupied the port of El Agheila between Benghazi and Tripoli in Libya, which fell on Monday after the British army withdrew. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>London - British military officials are now paying attention to the news that German armored units have arrived in Tripoli and that German troops have been entering the area for many days and have been reinforced recently. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Fleet in the Mediterranean Prepares for Secret Departure; Likely to Sail to the Atlantic; Part of Escort Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Algeciras, Spain - Unconfirmed reports from British-held Gibraltar say that most of the warships of the British Mediterranean Fleet are prepared for a large-scale secret departure. According to some sources, this fleet is likely to sail to the Atlantic. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>London - It is reported that the British ships recently engaged in escorting convoys in the Mediterranean include battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and the latest aircraft carrier, "Formidable." These ships escorted merchant ships to areas near German bases with great success. The planes carried on the "Formidable" shot down a German plane attacking merchant ships west of Crete. The next day, another German plane came to spy and was also shot down. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Gold Flows Steadily to the U.S.; Valued at $3 Million Last Week</h3>

<h3>Japanese Still Express Dissatisfaction with the Tripartite Pact</h3>
<p>Tokyo - During a recent special meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, there were mentions of the Japanese public's dissatisfaction with the Tripartite Pact. One budget committee member said that there are still many people expressing opposition to the Tripartite Pact and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. What methods does the Ministry of Home Affairs plan to use to stop this? The Minister of Home Affairs replied that we are closely monitoring this speech, but we do not want to punish it severely, lest everyone be afraid and never speak up. Another committee member, Mr. Oyama, mentioned the assassination attempt on Shingo Nakano in Osaka and the injury of one of Nakano's companions by gunfire, and asked if this incident had political motives. Hashimoto, the Chief of the Police Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, replied that this incident had no political motives and that the assassin was a repeat offender. It is noted that Nakano recently left the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in order to restore his previously dissolved political party. The newspaper did not previously report on the assassination attempt on him in Osaka. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3>Upcoming Election of Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Attempting to Find Harmonious Solutions; Original Rights of the British and Americans Must Be Maintained; Chinese Directors Should Have a Greater Voice; American Chamber of Commerce Discusses Equal Distribution of Seats Among British, American, and Japanese</h3>
<p>Yesterday (26th), a member of the American Chamber of Commerce stated that the Chamber is currently discussing "various solutions" for the upcoming annual election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, but there is no concrete decision yet. It is heard that one of the points currently being discussed by the American Chamber of Commerce is the suggestion of equal distribution of the nine seats on the Board of Directors among the American, Japanese, and British nationals, that is, the number of American and Japanese directors will each increase to three, and the remaining three seats will be for British directors. In addition, there is a proposal to advocate that the five Chinese directors should have a greater voice in the affairs of the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>American Chamber of Commerce to Continue Discussions Within the Week</p>
<p>It is heard that the American Chamber of Commerce has not yet made a definite decision, so the members of the Chamber will continue to meet within this week in order to reach a result as soon as possible. The reason why the American Chamber of Commerce is conducting this discussion is that British and Japanese nationals are currently engaged in consultations in order to reach a "gentleman's agreement" on the election of the Board of Directors this year. The British are seeking to maintain the status quo this year, but the Japanese have refused and insist that the number of Japanese directors must be increased to at least three.</p>
<p>Negotiation Content Remains Secret</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the election of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year, negotiations are currently being conducted among the British, American, and Japanese sides to resolve it, but the content remains a secret. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Western press visited Watanabe, the vice-chairman of the Japanese Ratepayers Association, and asked about the number of directors the Japanese side is requesting, but Watanabe declined to comment, only saying that the Japanese Ratepayers Association had held a meeting to discuss the position that the Japanese side should adopt when negotiating with the representatives of foreign nationals in this city. This meeting will be concluded in a few days.</p>
<p>Foreign National Groups Seek Harmony</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that various foreign national groups in this city are now taking advantage of the one-week extension of the election by the Shanghai Municipal Council to conduct negotiations in a diplomatic manner to promote "harmony" among all parties in the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement. However, it would be a great mistake to assume that the British and American foreign national groups are seeking to resolve the administrative problems of the Settlement at the cost of weakening British and American power. It is heard that the American side strongly opposes the British side's concession of allowing one more Japanese director. According to a leader of the British Association, the demands made by Japan in the past few years have been successfully dealt with. This year, the situation is different, so some people advocate forming a "gentleman's agreement" to avoid elections. If the opinions of the British and American sides can be consistent, this problem will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Overturning the Status Quo May Be Difficult</p>
<p>It is understood that, according to the bylaws of the Shanghai Municipal Council, among the nine foreign directors, only the five British directors can be changed. In addition, such as one American director and five Chinese directors, are all in the case of unchangeable. The current attitude of the Japanese side is that at least one Japanese director must be added, and its attempt is to get the British to give up one of the five British seats to Japan. However, in the view of the British and American nationals, if the British directors give up one seat, the British and American directors in the Board of Directors will become insignificant for all proposals. Therefore, they resolutely oppose the concession of this one seat, otherwise it is feared that it will cause the overturning of the status quo of the Settlement.</p>
<p>List of Candidates Not Yet Submitted to the Council</p>
<p>According to the announcement issued by the Consular Body on the 7th of last month, the British, American, and Japanese nationals should submit the list of candidates for the Council directors to the general office of the Shanghai Municipal Council before 12:00 noon on the 25th of this month. However, as of yesterday (26th), none of the lists of candidates from the British, American, and Japanese nationals associations have been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council. This is due to the ongoing behind-the-scenes negotiations between the British and Japanese sides. Although the Council director election has been extended by one week, the time is extremely pressing. Therefore, the solution to this year's Council director election must be decided by the middle of next week.</p>
<h3>Guillaume, Belgian Ambassador, Departs Shanghai for Hong Kong and Chongqing</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador to China, Guillaume, arrived in Shanghai from Beiping on the 23rd via the Qingdao Maru of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company. It has been four days since he arrived. In addition to inspecting the affairs of the embassy, he visits relatives and friends and attends banquets every day, which is quite busy. Because the ambassador is eager to go to Chongqing to visit the key figures of the central government, he has decided to take the American President Line's President Grant to Hong Kong this morning. The ambassador went to the ship last night because the ship had to weigh anchor in the morning. After the ambassador arrives in Hong Kong, he will have to stay for a day or two, and then he will take a plane from Hong Kong directly to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Central Bank and Farmers Bank to Resume Business Soon; The Four Banks Will Not Withdraw; Rumors Spread by Speculators; Settlement Authorities Send Police to Protect Business</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Farmers Bank tragedy, the Bank of China kidnapping case, and the bombing of the Central Bank and Farmers Bank occurred one after another, the Shanghai branches and offices of the Central Bank and Farmers Bank temporarily suspended business from the day before yesterday in order to repair the damaged houses and make arrangements. They will resume business as soon as preparations are completed. The Shanghai branches and offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are operating as usual. It is heard that the joint office of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank, has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that in order to protect the entire financial sector of Shanghai and the legitimate businesses of Chinese and foreign merchants, the Shanghai branches of the four banks will not withdraw due to coercion.</p>
<p>Senior Official Issues Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited a senior official of the Central Bank. He was not met because he was out on business. Therefore, a number of questions were left for response. The reporter received this written response yesterday morning, which is recorded below. (Reporter asked) Is it reliable to say that the four banks are withdrawing and that deposits are being made? (Answer) The withdrawal of the four banks cannot be decided by Shanghai and must wait for orders from Chongqing and Hong Kong. In fact, there is no reason for withdrawal. A few people may withdraw deposits due to panic. (Question) After this incident, what impact will it have on the financial sector in Shanghai? (Answer) The rumor that the four banks are withdrawing has given speculators the opportunity to create chaos, and it is expected that prices will rise. However, after the facts are clarified, the accidental financial disturbance caused by the bombing will return to calm. (Question) When will the Bank of China resume business? (Answer) Repairs should be completed in about two or three days and business will be resumed. Starting tomorrow (referring to the 26th), internal work may begin. (Question) How will the Bank of China handle the aftermath of the deaths and injuries of its employees? (Answer) At present, in addition to paying for the funeral expenses, all other aftermath measures must be handled by the central government. However, it can be said with certainty that preferential treatment will be given.</p>
<p>All Banks Will Resume Business</p>
<p>Reporters from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank that (1) the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Baker Road office will officially announce the resumption of business as soon as the repairs to the bombed-out houses are completed, and it is expected to open its doors no later than next Monday; (2) the Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China and the Wenyi Road office will resume business as soon as arrangements are completed, and it is said that it will open its doors tomorrow; (3) the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has decided to resume business today (Thursday) and resume all collections.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank publishes the legal foreign exchange rate and the collection balance tax rate at 10:00 am every day. Although the bank is temporarily closed due to the bombing, the listing has been temporarily suspended during the holiday period, but this does not affect the foreign exchange and financial market. The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is listed by the British HSBC Bank every day and remained unchanged yesterday. However, the actual transaction rate in the black market fluctuates from time to time due to rumors, which is not enough to be true. It is also heard that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is still cooperating with HSBC China Bank to maintain the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai and has not changed its established policy.</p>
<p>U.S. Marines Deployed to Enforce Order</p>
<p>The 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marines in Shanghai increased patrols by soldiers dispatched by Colonel Baker starting yesterday, and also added sentries to the posts to carry out strict guard. In addition, a large team of sergeants was dispatched in front of the doors of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, in the defense zone, with two to ten people in a group, fully armed, to take surveillance and guard. This measure is to assist the police authorities in prevention. Soldiers of the U.S. Marine Corps can be seen patrolling every few steps along Jing'an Temple Road, with a team of U.S. Marines with guns. Five U.S. Marines are stationed in the Central Bank area on Baker Road. This measure will not be withdrawn in the short term.</p>
<p>Banks Strictly Protected</p>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have decided to protect the businesses of the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, as well as various commercial banks and provincial banks. Therefore, starting yesterday, in front of each branch and office of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in the Concession, in addition to one or two members of the White Russian Merchant Corps armed with guns stationed there, four Chinese detectives were dispatched to patrol nearby to provide defense. However, U.S. Marine Corps soldiers are stationed in front of the banks in the U.S. Marine Corps defense zone. The French Concession authorities took the same steps as the Public Concession authorities. At the same time, the bank authorities have also made proper arrangements for prevention themselves, and all the bodyguards and security guards they employ have been dispatched to carry out strict guard, and special attention is paid to customers who have valuables.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Commander in North China Departs Shanghai for the U.S.; Colonel Thorne, Recalled to the Navy Department</h3>
<p>Colonel Thorne, Commander of the U.S. Garrison in North China and military attaché of the U.S. Embassy in Beiping, was ordered to return to the Navy Department in Washington to take up his post. He arrived in Shanghai in mid-month by the Beijing liner from Tianjin and had been busy with banquets and frequent contact with the U.S. officials in this port. It is now known that after Colonel Thorne completed his official and private affairs in Shanghai, he left Shanghai for the U.S. on the President Taft of the American Mail Steamship Company at 10:00 am yesterday. Colonel Baker, Commander of the 4th Fleet of the U.S. Marines, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, U.S. Consul General Lockhart, and many other private friends of Colonel Thorne went to the Xinzha Wharf to see him off, giving flowers or taking photos before parting. After Colonel Thorne shook hands with the people who were seeing him off, he boarded the ferryboat Marilyn Miller to transfer to the big ship. It is learned that Colonel Thorne will first land in San Francisco, stay there briefly, and then leave for Washington to take up his new post. Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Forces in this port, will also be ordered to return to the country, but his departure date is not yet determined. His successor, Colonel Howard, who is currently working in San Diego, will come to Shanghai to take up his new post before May.</p>
<h3>Japanese Abduct 200 Workers on Yidingpan Road Yesterday; However, the Japanese Military Authorities Still Claim Ignorance</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that, according to reports received today, the Japanese military authorities sent people to Yidingpan Road yesterday afternoon to abduct 200 Chinese workers. According to Chinese reports, the purpose of the Japanese army's abduction of a large number of workers was to force the workers to work for the Japanese garrison in this city, but the Japanese authorities denied it, saying that they were not aware of this incident. "Police officers" also said that they knew nothing about it.</p>
<h3>Public Transportation in the French Concession Resumed Yesterday; Improved Treatment Conditions Still to Be Negotiated; Public Transportation in the United Areas May Also Be Restored This Morning</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the French Tram Company, after mediation, resumed work yesterday morning. All of the company's buses and trams also left at 5:30 am yesterday, and the public transportation that had been suspended for a week was finally restored. At the same time, the water and electricity workers also resumed work yesterday.</p>
<p>Negotiating Conditions</p>
<p>It is heard that there are two conditions for the workers to resume work this time: (1) The arrested worker, Ah Mao Ni, must be released first; (2) Negotiations must begin immediately after resuming work to resolve the improved treatment conditions put forward by the workers. Both of the above conditions were fully accepted by the capital side, and negotiations on improved treatment conditions are also scheduled to be held at 5:00 pm today at the company on Rue Lyons. As for the statement in the newspapers yesterday that the company would give a total of sixty yuan in rice subsidies, there is no such thing and it must be decided after negotiations.</p>
<p>White Russians Dismissed</p>
<p>After the company authorities ordered the workers to strike, in addition to the suspension of buses and trams, the water and electricity sector, because it involved the lives of residents in the concession, temporarily hired more than a hundred White Russian workers to continue working. The supply of water and electricity in the concession was maintained as usual during the strike. Yesterday, because the labor strike had been resolved, all the temporarily hired White Russian workers were dismissed.</p>
<p>Public Transportation</p>
<p>Public transportation between the two concessions was not able to resume yesterday because the French Water and Electricity Company did not notify the Public Concession Tram Company authorities the day before yesterday. It is now heard that the notification from the French Electric Company was also issued yesterday, so the connection of public transportation between the two concessions is expected to resume this morning.</p>
<h3>Manipulating Coal Dust: Small Coal Ball Factories Request Intervention</h3>
<p>Because someone is manipulating large quantities of white smoke coal dust, the market price has soared. The price of coal balls has been raised to a new high of $226 per ton, causing public outcry and resentment. There is a unanimous call for punishing unscrupulous coal market brokers. Small coal ball factories in this city, including Yixin, Hongji, Beiyang, Lixing, and Yanyan, have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Mechanical Coal Ball Industry Association, reporting the coal hoarding brokers and appealing for assistance. The letter states: "Since the European situation has become tense and the situation in Shanghai is increasingly serious, speculation and manipulation have become common. Although coal is a necessity for people's daily lives, this phenomenon is unavoidable. Recently, the supply of coal dust has been continuous, but raw material dealers such as Yitaixing, Yicheng, and Tongcheng refuse to sell their hoarded goods, making their motives inscrutable. They even refuse to sell to small factories that they usually deal with. The suffering of our small coal ball factories is unspeakable. Outsiders, unaware of the situation, believe that our industry is making huge profits. However, small factories are limited by their financial resources and usually do not have sufficient inventory. Currently, we have no raw materials to purchase, and the shutdown of our machines is imminent. Once the small factories stop working, what will become of the thousands of workers? Social order is also at stake. We have long admired your leadership in the industry, and in this dire situation, you should step forward and take on this responsibility. We urge you to negotiate effectively with the aforementioned raw material dealers so that they can provide a continuous supply, allowing our small coal ball factories to overcome this difficult situation. We would be deeply grateful for your merits. Yesterday, the price of coal balls rose again by $40 per ton, and various sectors are complaining and blaming the coal ball industry for speculating. In reality, the price of raw materials has risen due to manipulation, and even at a price of $120, raw materials cannot be purchased. We ask, who should be blamed for this situation? Any discerning person can see that small factories have no raw materials and should not be held responsible. The manipulators are the raw material dealers. The current state of small factories is one of heavy losses. Therefore, we report our suffering to you and request your judgment. We also hope for an early reply. We are truly grateful. Addressed to: Chairman of the Shanghai Mechanical Coal Ball Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Japan Creating Opportunities: Foreigners Expose Conspiracy; Fabricating Rumors to Divide China Internally; Aim Achieved, Then War Against the U.S.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a person named U.F. Tanner sent a letter to the North-China Daily News, stating that in light of the recent developments in the international situation, it is clear that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's trip to Berlin was a provocative act against the U.S. Congress's passage of the Lend-Lease Act. It is now worthwhile to briefly discuss Japan's changing Pacific policy. Currently, Japan has two main enemies to deal with in the Far East: the United States and China.</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Exploit Opportunities</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's policy towards the U.S., even the extremists in Japan are hesitant and dare not risk an immediate war with the U.S. However, the Japanese still hope to take progressive action under more favorable conditions. The so-called more favorable conditions are the "possible" success of Hitler's spring offensive in Europe, and the weakening of China's strength due to internal conflict. Japan is currently doing everything possible to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Fabricating Rumors to Agitate Public Opinion</p>
<p>Matsuoka's trip was nothing more than to find out Hitler's intentions, seek the assistance of the Axis leader, and try to contact the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japan has realized that conquering China is impossible, because the Chinese people are determined to fight to the end, and the U.S. aid to China is increasing. Therefore, Japan is conspiring to expand the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Japanese newspapers exaggerate the "Kuomintang-Communist conflict" issue, even fabricating rumors and spreading false information that Chongqing has formulated a military plan to wipe out the Communist base in Yan'an, and that General He Yingqin will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the anti-communist campaign.</p>
<p>Conspiracy Achieved, War Will Begin</p>
<p>Japan dreams of using the conservative elements in Chongqing to reach a compromise, believing that if this happens, China will again fall into civil war and be unable to continue fighting against Japan. At that time, Britain and the U.S. will lose an "ally" and will have to stop aiding China. Japan almost hopes to complete this conspiracy and then fight against the U.S. We foreigners living in China have a responsibility to inform our fellow countrymen and Chinese friends of the truth.</p>
<h3>American Musician Brothers Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday to the Dutch East Indies to Collect Ancient Music in Oceania and the Far East; Several Other Famous Travelers Arrived on the Same Ship</h3>
<p>The famous American musicians Bruce and Sheridan Fennas Tuck arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 26th) morning aboard the American President Lines' President Jackson. The two are on a mission for the American Museum of Natural History to collect ancient music from Oceania and the Far East. They stayed in Shanghai for one day and boarded the same ship this (the 27th) morning to continue their collection work in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Traveling the World for Eight Years</p>
<p>According to Bruce's interview with reporters, he has been traveling the world to collect ancient music for eight years. His brother Sheridan came to China two years ago and saw a crowd of Japanese people gathering near the embassy in Beijing and cheering. When he tried to film it, he was beaten on the head by Japanese soldiers. After visiting the Dutch East Indies, the brothers plan to rent a boat in Singapore and travel around the islands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Associated Press Reporter Going to Manila</p>
<p>Other passengers passing through Shanghai on the President Jackson today include the Associated Press correspondent William Belings, who was originally stationed in Tokyo and is now being transferred to Manila. Belings lived in China for several years and covered the Nomonhan Incident on the border between Mongolia and Manchuria in 1939. Other passengers on the ship include Craig, a consultant for the U.S. Library of Congress, and Marty, the head of the Colonial Affairs Department of the Vietnamese government, who is returning to Vietnam after attending the Thai-Vietnamese reconciliation conference in Tokyo. In addition, the American President Lines' President Grant is scheduled to arrive in port around 2:00 PM today and will sail to Hong Kong and Manila tomorrow with the President Jackson.</p>
<h3>British Lawyer Williams Returning Home to Enlist</h3>
<p>Williams, a famous British lawyer at Gao Yi Law Firm, completed his pending cases yesterday (the 26th) morning and is scheduled to leave Shanghai today (the 27th) to return to England to join the army and serve his country. Williams has been working as a lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years, and he is often seen in the British Consular Police Court.</p>
<h3>Bank of China 100 Yuan Notes Without Place Name Are Acceptable</h3>
<p>Bank of China 100 yuan notes have been circulating a lot recently. They are divided into those with no place name and those with the name Chongqing. Because all of these notes were issued in Chongqing, the Shanghai branch used to refuse to accept them due to concerns that funds would flow into the occupied areas. Strict inspections were allowed for damaged, folded, torn, and stained notes. In recent days, the bank has slightly relaxed its policy on 100 yuan notes with no place name. However, notes with the Chongqing place name can only be remitted to Chongqing and cannot be used otherwise.</p>
<h3>Sasebo Japanese Navy to Hold Major Maneuvers; Nagasaki and Fukuoka Refuse Foreigners; Airplane and Ship Tickets All Suspended Yesterday; Japanese Army on Kyushu Island Also to Hold Exercises</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th), it was learned that the Japanese authorities had recently banned foreign tourists from traveling to Nagasaki by ship and from flying to Fukuoka for about three weeks. It is said that this is because the Japanese military and naval forces are expected to hold large-scale exercises during this period. The ban on foreigners purchasing ship tickets is from March 30th to April 10th, and the suspension of ticket sales to foreigners for airplanes is from yesterday until April 8th. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Japanese Consulate authorities seemed unaware of this. According to an official at the Japanese Consulate, the consulate is still approving foreigners to go to Nagasaki. However, yesterday morning, foreigners who wanted to go to Nagasaki and buy tickets from Japanese shipping companies were all rejected. They will have to wait until after April 10th to buy tickets. As for those who want to go to other ports in Japan, ship tickets can still be purchased as usual. In addition, Japan Airlines, which operates regular passenger air services between Shanghai and Fukuoka, has been refusing to sell tickets to foreigners in this city who want to go to Fukuoka since yesterday until April 8th. It is said that the Japanese Navy will depart from Sasebo Naval Base in the next few days to hold large-scale maneuvers, and the Army will also hold exercises on Kyushu Island.</p>
<p>Japanese Shipping Industry Denies to the Outside World</p>

<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice Slightly Affected by Strong Arrival; Hoarders' Silver Funding Turnover Inevitably Tricky</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening, carrying 17,371 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the French ship Albert Sarrant, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Company, arrived from Saigon carrying 2,800 tons of broken rice, totaling 26,971 bags. It arrived at the Pudong Hongsheng Wharf yesterday morning and docked to unload. In addition, the French Company's D'Artagnan postal ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying more than 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. (Zu)</p>
<p>Since foreign rice is arriving strongly and the posted price is high, the market is seizing this opportunity and observing slightly. In a few days, the total amount of rice that has arrived, been unloaded, and is waiting to be unloaded is no less than nearly 200,000 bags. Calculating the silver funding for this rice amounts to about 20 million yuan, plus the closure of the four banks, turnover is not as easy as before. Most of the scattered hoarders, due to insufficient strength, are eager to sell off as the market dictates. Therefore, the opening price in the morning saw a sharp drop, and as the supply was large and sales were slow, the market continued to fall. However, the afternoon price drop prompted local customers to buy more and cover their short positions, and rumors favored the buyers, so the evening closing was slightly firm. It is estimated that small jiaozhi has fallen from 3,600-700 yuan to 3,300 yuan. Zhongguan is only posting 3,100 yuan. No. 1 Saigon Gao fell from 3,200 yuan to 2,900 yuan, and finally to 2,600-700 yuan. No. 2 Saigon fell from 3,300-400 yuan to around 3,000 yuan. Broken Point is posting 2,200-300 yuan. As for other items, such as Siamese Huo Jiao, they failed to open. In short, compared to the previous market, the spread was sold off sharply by 500-600 yuan, equivalent to a drop of 4-5 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<p>The arrival of domestic rice such as Hou Bo Geng is still not much, and the thinking of both buyers and sellers has turned weak due to the sharp drop in the foreign rice market. Therefore, as the sales market has slackened, the intention to sell has also loosened, and all prices continue to be difficult to establish a foothold, continuing to depreciate by about 2 yuan. Changbang Hu sees a special white geng opening at 123-4 yuan, and ordinary at 120 yuan. Kunshan Hu sees a white geng gao from 118 yuan, finally to 111 yuan. Qingjiao Hu sees a thin rice at 112 yuan, 111 yuan and a half, and the original package is 16 yuan.</p>
<p>In this environment, glutinous rice should also be restricted. Under the eagerness of the cargo owner to sell off, the market price immediately fell sharply by 3-4 yuan. The opening of Hong Kong Baiyuan Gao fell from 105 yuan to 101 yuan, and Glutinous Tea from 95 yuan to 87-88 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Prospects Will Depend on Camp Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign flour market continued to weaken, because foreign sources were following up. In addition to the Australian flour transferred from Hong Kong, totaling 100,000 bags, more than 200,000 bags of Camp flour will arrive in port today and tomorrow. People in the industry are all pessimistic. However, foreign gang hoarders are still buying a lot. Hua Niao Zhong Lou brand Australian flour, because the packages are often broken and the inventory is gradually decreasing, is not welcomed by speculators, and the price has fallen to 29 yuan 20 cents, a sharp drop of one yuan compared to before. Jinlong brand Camp flour once fell below the 29 yuan mark, but then scattered households absorbed it at a low price, and the price returned to the 29 yuan mark. Its price has already been parallel with Australian flour. Judging from the quality of the flour, there should be a difference of about one yuan. However, at present, the importers are greedy for its complete package and the availability of inventory, and are actually using it as a speculative chip. It is said that there are a total of more than one million bags of Camp flour ordered. Therefore, the future foreign flour market will be based on Camp flour.</p>
<p>Wheat was calm yesterday. Checks show that there were no domestic or foreign sources, and all flour mills have no reliance on raw materials. Japanese factories are buying as needed and are not adopting a normal attitude. It is said that the current market price of high-quality durum wheat has reached 50 yuan, while the price received by Japanese factories is about 45-46 yuan, with occasional sporadic additions only.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Strong Externally, Weak Internally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market opened in the morning, continuing the fatigue of the previous day, and fell by a price unit. Afterwards, due to the exchange rate relationship, costs increased, and cargo owners sold in an unadulterated manner, causing futures to rise again, resulting in an increase of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous market, while spot only rose by about half a yuan, and factory oil fell by half a yuan. Therefore, the overall situation is still one of poor actual sales, inevitably strong externally and weak internally. It is estimated that 200 dans of factory oil were transacted, priced at 102 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian oil were transacted, priced at 138 yuan 50 cents. A contract was also placed for 3,000 barrels for delivery in April, priced at 136 yuan 50 cents to 140 yuan 25 cents, and a contract for 1,000 barrels for delivery in May, priced at 138 yuan 75 cents to 143 yuan.

<h3>Regarding the Problem of No Relief Fund, After the Joint Declaration of the Municipal Church, Other Organizations Unanimously Responded, the Municipal Education Federation and Other Organizations Telegraphed Chen Minister of Education to Petition, Striving for Fair Distribution and Universal Average</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Since the report that the Shanghai Municipal Education Staff Relief Fund has been distributed to the Education Department, many secondary schools have not received relief, and there is no landing on the primary school side, causing panic and public opinion uproar. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association, the Secondary School Friendship Association, the Municipal Sports Association, the Secondary Education Research Association, the Secondary School Moral Education Research Association, the Art Education Research Association, the Primary School Education Research Association, the Boy Scout Academic Research Association, etc., have jointly issued a declaration yesterday, striving for a reasonable solution, and solemnly stated that before a fair distribution is obtained, even if the distribution has been made, they do not want to take the lead in receiving it, and they have obtained the unanimous support of education personnel at all levels. It is learned that the Federation of Education Circles in this city, the Primary School Principals Association, the Primary School Teachers Forum, and the Private Primary School Association also believe that such distribution is unfair, and based on the public opinion of the members, jointly with the affiliated organizations, they urgently telegraphed Chen Minister of Education yesterday, requesting a redistribution, and the original text is excerpted as follows,</p>
<p>Education Federation Telegram</p>
<p>Urgent Education Minister Chen Junjian, according to various reports, the Shanghai Municipal Education Staff Relief Fund of 800,000 yuan has been distributed, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Circle colleagues are panicked after hearing about it. The Central Government has allocated funds to relieve the hard life of the education community in Shanghai. All of us are deeply grateful for the German intention, but the relief of the life of education staff should be universal and fair. Primary school teachers have the most difficult lives and should not be abandoned. The current distribution method is unfair. If it is rashly implemented, it will inevitably cause serious consequences. It is used to re-telegraph to you, and to observe public opinion, and to increase the relief fund by 600,000 yuan, or to redistribute it, in order to achieve an average. The future of the education community in Shanghai is fortunate. The telegram is urgently waiting for orders, the Shanghai Education Federation and affiliated organizations are all knocking,</p>
<p>Municipal Private School Telegram</p>
<p>Yu, Chen Minister of Education, Shanghai Municipal Primary School staff, school workers, etc., have been steadfast and self-reliant, struggling for three years. Because the level of life is getting higher and higher, it is extremely difficult, and the Shanghai authorities have repeatedly requested to increase the subsidy by 100% in this semester, and each person is affixed with five buckets of rice per month, to be forwarded for approval. The Executive Yuan has approved 800,000 yuan of relief funds for secondary and above schools, but Shanghai Municipal Primary Schools have no landing. After hearing about it, the public is angry, and the principals are difficult to contain. Please, Commander, understand the situation and quickly approve the subsidy and rice subsidy. The rush is anxiously waiting for orders, looking forward to a reply, the Shanghai Municipal Primary School Principals Association,</p>
<p>Yu Chen Minister of Education, According to reports, the hospital has allocated 800,000 yuan of relief funds to Shanghai Municipal Education Staff, which has been approved for exclusive allocation to secondary and above schools, and the public is panicked. This distribution is unfair. Teachers in universities and colleges should be relieved. Our primary school teachers are strictly guarding their posts, burying their heads in hard work, and striving to build education against the Japanese. I have never been slackened, and the pressure of life I have received is even greater than that of teachers in universities and colleges. A special telegram is used to earnestly request the Commander to quickly allocate large sums of money for relief. The four thousand colleagues are anxiously waiting for orders, the Shanghai Municipal Primary School Teachers Forum, the Shanghai Private Primary School Association are all knocking,</p>

<h3>Governor's Constitution Cup Running Cycle Re-match, Hualian Personnel Generated</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Newsletter) The Governor's Constitution Cup Football Re-match, the General Association West Union Team has been produced, at 5 pm on the 10th, the association selected the Hualian lineup, chaired by Shi Puhui, before the selection, he proposed that the departure of the Xingdao team to conquer the Philippines has not been determined, and should not be selected. After discussion, it was considered that it was doubtful that Xingdao Nengwu could arrive before the game, if it happened to return to Hong Kong one day before the game, all the goods were unloaded, and the spirit was related to the labor of the journey. It is also a problem to arrange two lineups for all-round consideration and to formulate a compromise. If Xingdao arrives before the 14th, the first lineup is used, otherwise the second lineup is applied. In the first lineup, three players from Xingdao are selected. In the second team, all are composed of Guanghua, Dongfang and Nanhua. The three major championships in which the Hong Kong Hualian participated have lost two, and the Governor's Constitution Cup is the only one that survives. Only hope that the selected players will not humiliate their mission. The first team is the ideal team, and the second team is the possible team. The arrangement is as follows,</p>

<h3>Life: An Inspiration from a Pair of Letters</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>In my life, I have only had one female friend, and I rescued her from the trap of depression and negativity. I have done the most sincere, noble, and friendly act in the world, which is enough glory in my life history.</p>
<p>She was a young woman, one year younger than me, and a classmate from my university days. The year we graduated, her father and mother passed away one after another. She hurriedly returned to her hometown of Jinhua to handle the funeral affairs, and then hurriedly came to Shanghai to participate in the graduation exams. Back and forth, no one noticed the dramatic changes in her psychology. Because she was a taciturn and thoughtful person, coupled with her frail body, she would not be noticed in a class. As for me, I maintained considerable affection for every classmate, but I was particularly concerned about her, not for any ulterior motives, but because of a connection in writing. It turned out that she had extremely high literary talent, excelling in poetry and novels. I usually also liked to appreciate and write literary works that others considered insignificant skills, but I preferred sharp and concise essays and prose. For this reason, I often exchanged writing techniques with her, and I knew her more deeply than anyone else—except for her parents.</p>
<p>That year, the death of her parents made her an orphan. She barely managed to complete the school exams. The day after the exams, while our class of more than forty young hearts were holding a tea party to celebrate, her slender figure was nowhere to be seen. We were all surprised, fearing that she had destroyed herself. That day, the cheerful atmosphere became gloomy, and everyone speculated about the possible consequences. But I remained silent, because I knew that she would notify me in advance no matter what—before she destroyed herself or ran away. I was just waiting for good news.</p>
<p>The next morning, I indeed received her letter. It turned out that she was preparing to wander and drift to spend her life. She wrote so sadly: "The ups and downs of my thoughts and the changes in my moods are beyond my own control. I am a weakling, and I no longer have the strength to fight for life and struggle with the environment. I wish to get rid of everything and let this fragile life end quickly... Friend, let us shake hands for the last time here! I am leaving tomorrow, and I have not decided where to go. Anyway, I am like a duckweed that has lost its parents, rising and falling, who cares?..." I read it word by word. I was not surprised, because this was the life attitude inevitably formed by her living situation and fragile heart!</p>
<p>But I felt I had a responsibility to save her. I boldly went to her apartment. She was packing her luggage. When I saw her busy scene, I greeted her lightly and stood aside. Finally, I spoke first, asking her where she was going and whether she had any job, etc. But her answers were still the same as those in the previous letter. However, she seemed to say a little more as if seeking something: "If there were a job in Shanghai, I would still like to stay for a year or two, because there are still many young friends here." "I will definitely find a way for you," I said, "No matter what, you must wait two weeks before leaving." She agreed, and I left her apartment without any nostalgia.</p>
<p>After returning home, I immediately wrote a letter to her: "...Those who have lost their parents are indeed lonely, but they can never be said to be isolated. Because family is a narrow prison, we should go to the vast society, like gold diggers tirelessly extracting the essence of life. Loneliness and suffering are enough to forge a person's ability to live. The world will never be forever submerged in the gloomy winter, and the warm spring will come... Rather than living a gray, cold, and painful life, why not live a happy and passionate life... Friend, you are still young, I hope you can cheer up again and live a meaningful life." At the same time, within two weeks, I found her a Chinese language teaching position at a girls' middle school. She accepted my recommendation and stayed there for a year and a half. And I also encouraged her to write and read books at any time to shift her solitary mood. She mostly accepted my advice and gradually became more positive.</p>
<p>During the winter vacation last semester, she said goodbye to me and went to Fujian. Because of the introduction of a friend of her father's, she became an assistant editor in the literary supplement of a newspaper there. I just received her letter the day before yesterday. She said: "Although it is very busy here, it is all work that I am willing to do, so I am very happy. I now have two completely different attitudes towards life from before. I have to thank you for saving me from the quagmire of boredom. You are my most sincere friend in my life... I also hope that you will write more about Shanghai and send it to me."</p>
<p>Yes, she is still an orphan now, but not a world-weary orphan. I saved her, and I felt the joy of victory.</p>
<h3>Last Words</h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>George Miller Beard, a famous American physician and scientist, his last words were: "I would like to record the thoughts of a dying man, which may also be beneficial to science, but unfortunately it is impossible!"</p>
<p>Rabelais was a playwright, and these words floated on his lips as he died: "Put down the curtain! The comedy is over!"</p>
<p>When Louis XIV was eighty years old and death came to him, he saw people sobbing around him and shouted, "What are you crying about? Didn't you think I would live forever?" When Washington was dying, he said to his secretary, "I am leaving! Put me in the coffin hastily and bury me in two days, do you understand? That's good enough!"</p>
<p>US President Wilson's last words were: "I am ready!"</p>

<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>"Yuan Baofan may have the ability to deceive my body, but he cannot deceive my heart, let alone make me forget everything in the past!" Luo Xiangqi's words gradually became passionate and indignant. "From the day my mother discovered his scam, her illness worsened. On the one hand, she hated him, and on the other hand, she felt too sorry for me, so she refused to stay there again. My father and I sent her back, so that she could breathe her last breath in her own home." Although more than a year had passed, Xiangqi could not help but have red eyes when she mentioned this matter.</p>
<p>In this passage, Begonia really felt unable to interject, and could only continue to sit quietly and listen.</p>
<p>"Because this house is where my mother closed her eyes, and the happiest days I have ever had in my life were spent here, I decided to keep it; I even used his money to renovate it completely, so it looks newer than before." As she spoke, a bitter smile appeared on Xiangqi's face. "My father has also been living here, until recently when he took a sum of money to the south to see my brother."</p>
<p>"Does Yuan Zhenshoushi often come...?" Begonia began to ask, but immediately felt too abrupt and quickly swallowed his words.</p>
<p>"He has never been here," Xiangqi already knew what he wanted to ask. "This is also what I agreed with him in front of Mrs. Hu Canjun. He can defile my body, but he can no longer defile my family! Now, everything here is the same as it was a year ago. It is quiet every day with no visitors. The watchman is still the deaf and dumb girl. When he was still a child in Tianjin, I lived here a lot. Our food, clothing, and expenses are all the same as before: it's just that I, this one person, is no longer a pure girl..."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Xiangqi's voice had become extremely bitter, which made Begonia immediately arouse a sense of pity and indignation from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>He supported his chin with one hand, staring at Xiangqi's face without blinking for almost five minutes without moving his sight; Xiangqi also seemed unaware, just looking at the few calligraphy and paintings on the opposite wall, unknowingly both of them were lost in thought. (65)</p>
<p>Cultivation</p>
<h3>The Procedure of Reading</h3>
<p>— Zhao Sheng</p>
<p>The world-renowned writer Maugham (W.S. Maugham) tells us: To read books on science and philosophy, one should do it in the morning before starting work, because both of these things require a fresher and more concentrated mind. Later, when your work is over, and you feel a little tired; at this time, it is best to read books on history, commentary, and biography. The time for reading novels should be left for the evening. In addition, you can prepare a few more collections of poetry, so that you can appreciate them whenever occasional joy occurs.</p>
<p>They tell us to cultivate the habit of reading. Books can help us solve many difficult problems that we may encounter on the road of life. (Translated from Maugham's original book "The Summing Up")</p>

<h3>Northern Opera World News</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>The Struggle between the Two Lis: The struggle between Li Wanchun and Li Shaochun used to be called the struggle between the two Lis. The current struggle between the two Lis does not refer to the struggle between Wanchun and Shaochun, but refers to the struggle between Li Wanchun and Li Hongchun. The reason is that Li Wanchun went to Shanghai last year, but failed to travel with Hongchun. Hongchun was originally a mainstay in Wanchun's troupe. Since then, Hongchun abandoned Wanchun and cooperated with the martial artist Li Shengbin, specializing in performing the plays performed by Wanchun. When Wanchun returned north, he saw that Hongchun intended to challenge him, so he was unwilling to show weakness, and fought against Li Shengbin and Li Hongchun. Li Hongchun rehearsed ten episodes of "Iron Rooster", and Li Wanchun rehearsed twenty episodes of "Iron Rooster". Under the confrontation between the two sides, Li Hongchun's "Iron Rooster" has been rehearsed to the "Fortieth Episode". In addition to the protagonist Li Shengbin, the actors also include He Yuqin from the opera school, and Mao Qinglai, Li Wanchun's old partner. According to Li Wanchun's visit to the south last year, Mao Qinglai did not accompany him, but Wanchun claimed to the outside world that Mao was in Ping to preside over the Mingchun She opera class organized by him, and had no time to come south. In fact, Mao and Li had already fallen out. In addition to joining Li Shaochun's troupe, who was Wanchun's enemy, Mao is now cooperating with Li Shengbin and Li Hongchun, which undoubtedly demonstrates to Wanchun. Judging from this situation, it can be seen that it is difficult for Mao and Li to reconcile.</p>
<p>The Whereabouts of the Actors: Recently, there are no good operas to listen to in the old capital. The reason is that the major famous actors have successively gone to other places to perform. Cheng Yanqiu went to Qingdao, Xun Huisheng went to Shanghai, Ma Lianliang went to Jinan, Tan Fuying went to Tianjin, and Yan Jupeng went to Nanjing. Those currently performing in Ping, in addition to the troupes of Shang Xiaoyun, Jin Shaoshan, and Xi Xiaobo, are all female roles or inexplicable characters. The situation is not very prosperous.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Swallows Kick Flying Flowers, Falling on the Dance Mat</p>
<p>The female performer sold her skills singing and dancing on the rope for a while, already showing her graceful waist and lively skills, but she was still standing up there and not coming down. The gongs and drums below were also beating urgently. A burly man with his chest bare led a white horse over and stopped under the rope waiting. The young woman suddenly turned over and fell down from the rope. Everyone was worried that she would lose her footing and fall to the ground, but they saw that when she turned over, her small feet had already hooked onto the rope. Her body was hanging upside down under the rope, shaking a few times, like a willow swaying in the wind. Everyone couldn't help but cheer. After the woman hung on the rope, she took off one foot, leaving only one foot hooked on the rope, like a dragonfly hanging. The gongs and drums beat even louder. She twisted the rope under the rope, turning a windmill, quickly turning seventeen or eighteen times. The gong sounded non-stop, and her body turned non-stop. Everyone watched with admiration and longing, sweating for her. She spun more than thirty times, and the eyes of the crowd blurred. Suddenly, like a glimpse, her body fell like a small bird. Everyone thought she was going to fall again and shouted "Ah!" Who knew that the woman was standing properly on the back of the horse. The burly man slapped the horse's butt with the whip, and the horse immediately carried the woman and walked around the field in circles. After walking around once, the woman leaned back again, supporting the horse's back with both hands, her body standing straight upside down, and the horse ran. Xu Jing watched and said to Li Xin: "Don't underestimate this skill-selling woman, her skills are not bad, she is really as light as a swallow. I remember the Tang poem has this sentence: 'Blowing fine waves shakes the song fan, swallows kick flying flowers falling on the dance mat', this woman can sing and dance, but falls into the dust, what a pity!" Li Xin watched with great interest and said: "Is that so! It's a pity that Chen Fei took the first step and left, otherwise his light body skills are very good, he can let him compete with this red-clothed girl." While the two were talking, the woman's horse had run to the front of the two. The woman turned over, still standing on the horse, glanced at the two, smiled sideways, intentionally or unintentionally, Xu Jing looked at her and smiled at Li Xin. Li Xin also felt that the skill-selling woman had already paid attention to the two of them. (22)</p>
