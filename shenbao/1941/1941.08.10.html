<p>社評</p>
<h3>遠東大局瞻望</h3>
<p>日本於再度侵蝕越南之後，一方調集大軍開赴東北，待機而動，一方則陳兵泰國邊境，要求「合作」；此在民治國方面，除英美已以平行照會送達泰國聲明願爲後盾，及中國加强西南防務準備萬一外，羅斯福總統又突於此際的會邱吉爾首相，商討遠東大計，並傳史丹林及甫自蘇聯返美的霍甫金專使也參加其事；凡此種種，證明遠東侵略者與反侵略陣綫雙方，均已劍及履及，準備在不久的將來，實行「攤牌」。在這暴風雨將臨的前夕，世人雖抱有「光明不遠」的充分信心，但對於當前所可遭遇的一切事變，却不能不以最大勇氣加以應付。</p>
<p>在英美加緊經濟封鎖之下，日本顯已處於騎虎難下的境地，知難而退旣須損及「威望」，乃至動搖「國本」，今後勢非冒險「突圍」不可，近日東京報紙及石井輩之一再以中英美荷包圍綫爲言，正是日本當局在行動之前甩以刺激國民的準備工作，但按之實際，日本如果侵犯泰國，中英緬三方既首當其衝，爲自衛計，勢必共同出以積極對抗，同時美國過去旣曾因越南問題而對日發動凍結資金和禁止油運，則今後自必更因泰國被佔，而對日實施更嚴峻的制裁手段，俾和中英緬的軍事行動相呼應，結果所屆，南太平洋土必然立即引起大戰，那時荷印澳洲菲律濱乃至美國的被牽入漩渦，當然祗是時間問題。顧當此遠東各民治國聯合陣綫佈置經年，早已粗具規模的今日，世人不禁要問日本究竟在軍事上還有多少實力，敢和此後援無窮的聯合陣綫作對，更要問日本對於英美所發動的經濟封鎖戰究能支持多少時日？假定日本佔領泰國之後。更能一舉而攻下新加坡，進窺荷屬東印度，今後南太平洋當然演成日本稱覇的局面，萬一不然，則日本必然一敗塗地，毫無疑問。</p>
<p>日本或者「聲南擊北」，表面上壓迫泰國，做盡決意南進的姿態，以分散英美的注意力，實際上却等待在德蘇戰爭中，抓住一個「可乘之機」，俾向蘇聯後背—海參崴，刺入一刀，此一舉動，其優點在於所可遭遇之危險，不若南進之大，而且在戰略觀點上。可能爲日本本部解除最大的威脅，因爲遠東紅軍如果以海參崴爲根據地，派機空襲北滿，朝鮮和日本本部，易如反掌，今後萬一美蘇兩國果眞在遠東實行合作，則其所可加諸日本的壓力，將更非一個新加坡或馬尼剌所得比擬；因此，日本爲經濟利益打算，固以南進的可能收穫爲大，但若爲國防安全計，則顯以北進的需要更爲迫切，無如遠東紅軍的龐大實力，並不像日本一般北進派所想像的那麼容易對付，何况根據昨日合衆社電訉，英美兩國殆將一方加强西太平洋的防務，一方更以實際行動警告日本，使其了然英美不能坐視其侵蘇，可見日本即使向這一方面蠢動，也很難有獲逞的機會。</p>
<p>總之，今日在經濟上外交上十足孤立的日本，已至必須冒險行動的最後節段，這是十分明顯的事實；但是根據上述，無論其南進也罷，北進也罷，不但難於想像「一帆風順」，甚恐俱將荊棘滿途；不過，即使困難甚多，第三决組閣的近衛旣已處於「再無成績勢難戀棧」的窘迫局面之下，事實上必有急不暇擇，鋌而走險的一日，因此民治陣綫必須磨礪以須，對於一切可能的發展，預籌應付方策，最好當然是爭制機先，萬一不能，至少須在守勢戰略上，自措於無隙可乘的嚴密地步，首先應當切實樹立的，當爲中英美蘇荷五國的全面合作，並相的以聯合行動應付一切事變；具體言之，日本假定先動泰國，中英兩國立即應戰，固屬事所必至，同時遠東紅軍必須在北方盡牽掣之力，而美荷菲及英國各自治領則更應加强對日封鎖、反之，日本如先事北進，除中國可在華北加緊反攻，分散日軍兵力外，英美荷諸國更應一方切斷日本的一切對外交通，一方加緊接濟中蘇兩國、以助其完成對日的最後打擊；這種聯合行動的確定和準備，無疑地，應是今日各民治國政府的當務之急。</p>
<h3>大批日機　昨日又分批襲渝　在西郊山間投彈甚多　對軍事目標均未命中</h3>
<p>重慶　軍息、（一）被華包圍於楊家灣、黃家塲、郭家冲、常家岑等地之日軍、經華軍連日痛擊、大部就殲、華復乘勝掃蕩、刻已將關莊塲一帶日軍肅淸、（二）宜昌以北華軍將犯許家河等地之日軍擊破後、七日晨續克龍王洞蕭家岡、日軍潰退、華軍跟踪追擊、直抵霧渡河西岸、日倉皇爭渡、復因河水暴漲、被擊斃及落水淹死者、無慮三百餘人、至曹家堊方面、日軍亦被華殲滅甚多、（八日電）</p>
<p>恩施　（一）宜昌外圍華軍克復聚家河、石板灣後、七日續將龍王洞佔領、日不支向小溪塔方面退去、華軍跟踪追擊、日退至小溪塔之黃柏河時、正河永暴漲、勢極洶湧、日欲背水作最後掙扎、經華逐步壓迫至河岸、日大都被迫落水、隨波流去、餘亦完全爲華擊斃、（二）七日晨宜昌西岸日軍四百餘分乘木船數十隻、向宜昌市區進行、經華砲兵發覺、描準日船轟射、僅數分鐘、日船數十隻全爲華砲火擊中覆沒、日軍無一倖免、（三）向郝穴方面進犯日軍千餘、七日晨已破華擊潰、日復向岑河口退去、死傷甚重、華獲軍用品極多、現正繼續向前追擊中、（七日電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國工業合作運動、發創迄今、已滿三年、當在此間慶祝、工合協會各分會代表、齊集陪都、舉行集會、由美籍總顧問費吳生主席、按工合運動草創伊始、規模不大、茲已突飛猛晋、有工作人員四萬五千名、分爲合作細胞組織七百所、每年生產物價値在二千萬元以上、（八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間消息皴通方面昨夜吾認日方所傳中英兩國成立軍事協定之說、此項消息殆由中國自日軍進佔越南以來、即在滇桂邊一帶佈置防務而起也、中國認日本之佔據越南乃對中國西南諸省之威脅、故以高級軍事要人駐於雲南、以監視國防之佈置、聞中央政府與滇省當局對於防務已有完全之諒解、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>重慶　重慶於二十四小時間、竟爲日本轟炸　機二百二十架襲擊五决、最後一次係在本日下午三時三十分、重慶本日所受襲擊、不下三决、每决參加轟炸之日機數目雖多、全市所受之損害尙少、報界會館一帶、受襲甚重、此决轟炸日機顯已使用新戰　、以避免密集之高射砲火、每决轟炸時、日機係分爲數組、分自三四處不同之方向飛人重慶、向城市投彈、此項方法、顯係欲困惑高射砲手、此輩高射砲手已逐漸善於運用其高射砲、其發出之火網較以前更爲嚴密、此間居民甚少睡眠、因在上午十二時一十分即進防空壕躱避、直至四時而飛臨於城市上空者僅有飛機三架、顯係意圖騷擾而已、至上午七時三十分本日之首次襲擊開始時、居民又須逃避、故在床上安眠之時間、並無幾許、本日最後一次空襲警報係在下午三時二十分發出、（九日合衆電）</p>

<h3>日泰局勢　未見改善　東報傳英迫泰　簽訂防務協定</h3>
<p>路透社九日盤谷電　此間外交方面認過去數小時內、日·泰局勢未有多大改善、並謂、艾登·赫爾之言論、已使泰人興奮、但空氣現猶不定、如局勢中現有之少許進步得以維持、則或可希望泰國目前風潮將與荷印前有之風潮同樣銷減、不過泰國風潮與荷印風潮不盡同耳</p>
<p>海通社九日東京電　朝日新聞昨接盤谷通訊員電話報吿稱、自可靠政界人士方面獲悉、英國已向泰國建議簽訂防務協定、並在泰境設立軍事根據地、英國並擬以前屬於泰國今已併入緬甸及馬來半島版圖之土地歸還泰國、如泰人拒絕此項要求時、泰國所有在英、美之資金的二〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇泰幣將被凍結、　該訪員述此要求提出之經過情形稱、八月二日英駐泰公使克羅期培爵十訪泰國總理宋格蘭將軍、晤談的、小時之久、日後、駐稱谷之英·美·荷領事、但泰國代理外交部長對該事加以考慮、東京日日新聞昨亦載稱、盤谷中國商業人士均知、英國曾向泰國建議訂定商業協定、使泰國停止以米·橡皮·錫運往日本、泰國如同意、則可恢復其失去之領土、英國現已設法阻止將物品運往泰國如錫鑛等物、以迫使泰國停止以錫運日、</p>

<h3>日本資金　在美凍結　値一億三千萬元</h3>
<p>合衆社九日華盛頓電　商務部昨日估計、被美國凍結之日本資產共計値美金一三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇、高務部稱、依照凍結命令、不僅被凍結國家在此問所有之財產、須領得照會方許交易、即美國與被凍結國間一切其他財務交易之付款、亦須領取照會、封鎖外國資產應視爲係在現時之緊急時期中之一種保護看管、因凍結統制係國防之一種特殊要素也、利息紅利租金及資金、仍許自美國自由移轉、直至各項凍結將此種交易移歸官方統制始已、財部宣稱、被凍結之日本資產、若與在七月十四日被凍結之歐洲資產美金二·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元相較、實屬不多云、</p>

<h3>遵守公法國家　毋須畏懼包團　赫爾答覆東京言論　認日實係咎由自取</h3>
<p>路透社九日華盛頓電　此間人士以爲、日官塲所稱、英、美認日本對泰有侵略企圖實屬錯誤之說、果屬不謬、則大是佳事、惟恐英、美未必錯誤耳、日方所發反對被人包圍之言論、美國務卿赫爾已予以充分之答覆、赫爾之言曰、凡遵守法律之國家、勿庸以包圍爲慮、此言即謂如日本未有侵略企圖、而心地和平、如其發言人所言、則對美國無所用其一憂慮也、此間一般人士難以相信滿洲之被搜奪、中國之被侵略、越南之被佔據、乃心地和平的國家之行逕、而觀於泰國所受壓力之明證、允覺其對日疑念之確有理由、泰國旣受壓力、凡與泰國爲鄰之遵守法律的國家、乃不得不有戒備、泰國未嘗有請求加入日方所謂共榮圈之紀錄、乃東京偏謂泰國必須列入共榮圈內、此與東京最近所發不欲侵略泰國之說、亦自相矛盾、難以融洽、</p>
<p>攻泰不啻孤注一擲</p>
<p>華盛頓現有一種感想、以爲凡出自東京者其語調同爲日本語調、然其技術則爲納粹技術、日方所發不欲對泰侵略之聲明、亦猶德國在鯨呑歐洲許多國家以前、所發不侵略他國之聲明矣、衆認泰國將爲太平洋戰爭之起點、如波蘭之爲歐洲戰爭起點然、惟以此間所見、日本在太平洋中、並未據有如德國發難時在歐洲所有之堅强地位、如敢深入泰國、則不啻冒舉其全國命運作孤注一擲之險、日本執政者今當信赫爾、艾登之言論、而知此種大危險之存在、旣知之而猶願冒之、或無其人也、是以此間相信、東京至少此時當覺悟此舉危險性之過大、</p>
<p>合衆社九日華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨日答覆東京所傳中、英、美、荷印正包圍日本時稱遵守國際公法之國家、不須畏懼包圍、叉言、如任何國家發覺本身被遵守國際公法之國家所包圍、實係咎由自取、</p>
<p>德圖控制拉丁美洲</p>
<p>論及德方美國企圖控制拉丁美洲時、赫爾稱、此乃業巳攫奪歐洲十五國家、並正思征服美洲之國家所作不斷之藉口、赫爾云、德人所言、乃一透明之宜傳、西半球上無人加以置信、渠又言、國務院正研究救出顚沛於日本、英國或其他區域內之美人、　爾拒不評論渠與蘇大使烏曼斯基及蘇聯赴華盛頓使團首席代表伊凡諾維區之談話內容、</p>

<p>路透社九日　敦電　據莫斯科消息、蘇機星期四晚間空襲柏林後、昨晚父繼續飛往德京轟炸、德方亦承認其首都巳連遭兩晚空襲、昨晚華沙·加里資·及拉桐之德方電台、均因空襲停止播音云、</p>
<p>路透社九日瑞典京城電　瑞典各報駐柏林訪員電稱、星期四晚間蘇機第一次空襲柏林時、居民皆猝不及防，因至炸彈爆裂、始知敵機巳在頭頂也、</p>

<h3>美駐華記者所述香港的景象（一）</h3>
<p>美國煤船週報駐記者M.Gelhorn氏，近頃旅行過港，草成香港印象一文，刊於Collier's雜誌，其中叙述香港一般生活情形及當地防務一瞥，頗可覘杳港現時準備的全貌，茲特節錄如决：</p>
<p>緣山映碧海</p>
<p>在藍灰色平靜的海面上，聳起無數座翠綠的峰　，這就是香港的外貌。香港周圍有許多渺小烏喚拱列，像不適宜人們居住的由頂，點級在海洋中，香港隔一海灣，就是九龍城和新界。新界爲一片楔形多山的陸地，是山香港至中國內地的要道。每值冬季，香港的綠山，新界的黃邱，都被霧。雨和灰色低雲所籠罩。但一春天，惠風和暢，正與美國的佛羅列達·加利福尼亞·或法國南部諸地相似。</p>
<p>在港口前面，沙船雲集，排列着的無數桅　，形成一條界綫。在這界綫之外，聯絡香港與九龍的綠色渡船，船笛嗚嗚，鼓輪往來不絕。貨船停在靠九龍一邊的船塢中，郵船停在離海岸甚達的海洋中。一艘灰色英國巡　艦駛向海外去，船首有不少舢板船划開。抱船·游艇·海軍小艇·本港水巡船等等在海上交縱來去。港口的活躍，擁擠·吵鬧一如香港的市街一樣。</p>
<p>香港對於一個初游者所見到的有：泰唔士方塲的除夕，下午五點牛的地道景色，一决警報三回的火警，一個公共拍賣塲，玩着風琴的鄕下市集。街道與海岸平行，有三條街在平面的地上；後面接着是要尚上爬的山道。石級兩旁，有人家和商店。半山裏綠翠如蓋，再上面去，突出於山峰之中，是無數豪富的邸節。山居的富翁可以望見港中一切美麗的景色，和街道密接的城市，但他們不能聽到或嗅到一切。</p>
<p>住在香港的人的有八十萬，大多數都是八個或十個人擠在一間房間中。城市中只是充滿着居民的氣息，還有華人的炊烟，庫埃，溝渠中的垃圾，和沒有陰溝人家中汚水的氣息。有時從　綠的陸地上吹來一陣和風，街市綫覺得日暖花香，連帶還覺到一陣乾的海草香味。但是你得明白，香港究竟在怎樣　狀態中。</p>
<p>在各秤橙色·紅色·黃色的市招之下，店家的柱上張貼了圖畫與標語。中國苦工緩綏的走着，處處聽見木拖鞋敲在水門汀上的噪聲。突然在各色各樣的喧囂之中，一陣鞭砲，有如機關槍聲。鞭砲之響，可使你十分鐘內聽不到任何警音，而且還有股濃厚的火藥味。總是有人在慶賀生日或結婚，鞭砲　說可以予人以佳運。等砲仗燃放完了，香港總算暫時安靜一會。</p>
<p>自山巔的書棟雕樑以至下面近港口的齷齪陋巷，香港像一連環馬戲塲。那裏有特別包廂，專待縉紳階級的光臨，馬戲塲中小戲極爲充分。快樂谷跑馬地是一圈綠地，周圍有羣山爲界。跑馬地位在山峯陋巷之間，兩個世界被這僅有的範籬隔開。每遇賽馬日期，售出獎券平均有港幣五十萬元。今年　馬頭獎港幣三十九萬七千六百元，得中是四個貧苦中國女人。在塲地一面賣彩票的旗招像叛逆者的呼喚。高高一面大布上用中文寫着馬名和中獎號碼，密密層層的華人付了幾仙的費用站在籬畔觀看</p>
<p>在籬笆一面，就是俱樂部，屋頂上有私人特別看台。每一看台都有一餐室附附屬。中西富豪，女人穿了高領頭，長的緊的旗袍，自看臺上湧出來走到彩票棚中買馬票。業餘騎師有葡萄牙人。中國人，羅宋人·英國人·穿了炫目的衣服，騎一匹小馬在塲中躑躅來去。午飯時間，窮苦女人擠出跑道，赤足離開跑馬地。（未完）</p>
<p>（一）英國小軍艦巡邏香港海口。有一潛水艇阻止船隻來往。</p>

<h3>滬戰四周年將屆　兩租界昨起戒備</h3>
<p>不必要馬路架鐵綱封鎖</p>
<p>各界民衆籌備沉痛紀念</p>
<p>「八一三」四週紀念、轉瞬將屆、租界當局咋開始特別戒備、封鎖不必要馬路、禁止集會游行、並嚴厲執行宵禁、各界民衆籌備沉痛紀念、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>各界準備沉痛紀念</p>
<p>滬市各界民衆、以滬戰叫週紀念期邇、而滬市環境特殊，故決遵從租界當局之意旨、並不舖張紀念儀式、但爲表現市民對抗建之信念、及悼念死亡將士同胞起見、故經議決於是日一律茹素一天、並停止娛樂宴會、於正午各就原位靜默誌哀、以作沉着之紀念、</p>
<p>租界當局開始戒備</p>
<p>兩租界驚務當局、以滬戰紀念期近、爲確保租界治安起見、公共租界特於昨晨起將沿愛多亞路·福煦路一帶、各不必要馬路、如江西路·廣西路·帶鈎橋·雲南路·龍門路·重慶路·呂來路·慕爾嗚路等、均各加置鐵絲網、斷絕交通、他如外灘·四川路·河南路·鄭家木橋東新橋·大世界·成都路·同孚路、西摩路·等亦各欄成出入口、由探捕駐守、檢查往來可疑行人、蘇州河各橋樑、亦各設崗位八人、實施檢查工作、共他並禁止一切集會遊行示威、加緊宵禁法令、各馬路則由巡查班巡弋、法當局雖尚未封銷馬路、但對其他措置、亦一如公共租界，此項措施、將延長至十四日爲止、屆紀念節時、再視情形需要、加緊橋棵馬路對鎖工作、以策租界之安寗、</p>
<h3>昨日風雨止　全市恢復常態</h3>
<p>颶風過滬進襲華北　水陸交通均已恢復</p>
<p>太平洋颶風、於前晚九時挾七個至九個之風力、掠過上海東部以北進後、昨日颶風餘威猶在、而秋雨亦時斷時續、天色乍晦乍明、迨至傍晚、始漸呈晴朗之象、唯以昨日仍值秋汛高潮、雖前晚積水漸退、低窪之處澤國依然、然其情勢已大不如前日之惡、故公共車輛漸决恢復、海關所懸之十字記號、亦即卸下、中斷一日之航運、重行轎通、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>颶風北上直撲黃海</p>
<p>據昨晨六時徐家匯天文裹報告、颶風掠滬而過後、其進行方向爲北西偏北、地位已在東經一百二十二度及北緯三十三度之間、風力為五個至六個、仍有繼續逾東海而入黃海之勢、蘇北及華北沿海、將受波及、但因風力及速度均日趨减低之故、爲害不至過分劇烈、據悉前晚吳淞口外、因適當風力中心之衝、小型波船及舢舨等、沉沒甚多、但浦江各船、早經海關警告、相率避於安全之處、幸未緊慘禍、</p>
<p>進出航運漸次恢復</p>
<p>黃浦進口船隻寥寥、出口船全無、减退、中午海關解除警報、　球降落、黃浦交通逐漸恢復昨晨首先進口者、爲行駛江北之華通小輪九時四十分到埠、繼之爲行駛滬甬綫之日輪嗚鬥丸，於上午十時五十五分進口、由寗波返滬、下午十二時十分柯姆沛輪抵埠、三時二十分（上述時間係海關鐘）太古公司安順輪、山華南來滬停靠浦東碼頭、川口昨日下午有漢陽輪駛香港、定生輪赴烟津、法輪勞亞斯號往海防、及行駛江北之華通小輪亦出口、昨日全日進出口共祇八輪、太古公司新北京輪、諒在途避風、又未見到、大的今日可進口、此次颶風據航業稱、本市幸未遭正面襲擊、故影響不大、</p>
<h3>英美在滬權益　決心表示維護</h3>
<p>縱局勢嚴重亦決不放棄</p>
<p>因日本積極向泰國發動侵略、致遠東風雲、更趨緊張、太平洋火藥庫、已瀕於爆發之前夕、上海爲第一遠東第一大商埠、影響所及、自較其他各地爲巨、昨此間英美旅滬僑民、巳開始撤退、太平洋航運即將斷絕、以致一般市民、恐慌異常、平明社記者爲探詢事實之眞相起見、昨特歷訪本埠各有關方面人士、承告各項意見如决、某美傷領袖稱、遠東局勢之惡化、今日巳至極點、美國巳抱決心、決不因侵略國之威脅、迫令吾人放棄遠東合法之利益、上海現已失却政治地位、僅爲一商業中心、假如太平洋戰事、不幸一且爆發、吾人在上海之商業、仍將維護不退、越南西　等處、美僑原不甚多、且商業範圍、亦甚狹小、美僑乘早撤退、亦固其宜、至於上海情形不同、自不可以一概而論、所謂撤僑命令、僅係一種促使自動之勸告、凡負有重要商業上及其他方面之有任務者、外傳美國巳開始加速撤退旅滬美僑、殊不可靠、</p>
<p>早經準備不受威脅</p>
<p>英僑重要人員稱、太平洋之戰事、將爲此决歐洲戰事之一環、不可分離、吾人已準備就緒、不使吾人之權益、橫受侵害、至中英同盟、乃係別有用意者之故甚其辭、然無論如何、遠東之必要戒備、現已完竣、吾人預備接受任何人之挑釁、上海尚有英僑一萬零數百人、包括印人及英藉華人在內、惟最近並無特殊之撤退舉動、</p>
<h3>大利大新兩輪　試航滬鰲綫</h3>
<p>滬溫航遝因江海關停止結關中斷後、迄已多時、咋據航業界悉、最近有意商大利輪、由滬載貨駛往古鱉頭、巳於日前駛返來滬、尚有英商大新輪、亦於本月七日由滬啓椗、惟迄昨尚無電告、該兩輪因試航性質、均未載客、惟悉江海關對該處航輪、仍未正式許可結關、</p>

<h3>申請助學者　實地訪問記（四）</h3>
<p>沒有父親的孤兒，沒有丈夫的寡婦，是人間最無依無告者。這回申報讀者助學金申請的學生中，不少就是沒有父親的孤兒，而不少還仗着他母親掙扎着米撫養他們，教育他們。像這一般孩子，我們應該如何的表示熱烈的同情，來助成他們的　業！</p>
<p>賢惠的母親</p>
<p>愚園路上富麗的高樓大廈中間，有一條平民化的弄堂，這是出乎意外的，在第一家的客堂中，會見了這位小妹妹的姨母，客堂就是臥室，陳設間樸，她的母親已到學校裹的暑期班去教書去了。原來她的姨母也是小學教師，這是她姨母告訴我的：孩子的父親，戰前經商天津，事變之後，迄今音信全無，看來已不在人閒了！她在浙江的戰區中，冒着烽火，把他們母女三人接了出來。還有一個小的妹妹，今年也小學畢業了，並目已考取了中學。她們的母親到了上海，千辛萬苦，就在小學中教書，把她們撫養教育起來。但是一憫小學女教師如何負得起二個中學女生的學費？如果申報助學金申請不成，那末只好把小的妹妹輟學了！但是她母親培養她的孩子的心很股切，一對聰明伶俐的姊妹，也渴望着繼續續書啊！</p>
<p>孤兒寡婦</p>
<p>在赫德路的一家中，也遇見了一個相同命運的女孩子，五歲的一年上，父親去世了！如今她將是初中二年級了，在這七年中、她母親就是在小學中敎書，艱苦的把她撫育起來，孤兒寡婦，眞值得我們同情！幸得她們母女是基督徒，她們相信艱苦中是有希望。她母親告訴我說，下學期她教書的職位，還沒有決定哩！道孩子呢，算學的程度較差，但是對香樂却有天才，彈詹很好的鋼琴啊！</p>
<p>這孩子眞要讀書</p>
<p>十六歲的男孩子，長得　別的高大，顯着他的體格很好。他父親是一家印書房的工人，四年前已經去世了，母子江人，仗他叔叔的膽養，和親戚的幫忙。今年但是初中二年級的學生，在此生活高漲下，他叔父冉不負擔他的學費了；但是他告訴我他的教育還不够啊！鄰居對我說，他們母子生活眞苦，但是這孩子眞要讀籌。一位五十左右的老年人，是孩子的母親，說「人家幫我的忙，我們將來是要報答的。」</p>
<p>遺下三方廣告牌</p>
<p>十六歲的孩子，是男的，已經高中二年了，表示他的智力，還相當的聰明，面目很　秀，對答也很流利，彬彬有禮，他住在卡德路一家的亭子間內。一位母親，二個姊妹，他父親去世四年了！剛巧是戰事爆發的那年！他父親牛前是經營路牌廣告事　，如今餘下來，還有三方路脾，母于四人，就依此過活。初中畢業後，保送入南洋中學，上學期的學費祇付了一半。南洋，他告訴我說，是沒有免費額的；但等到學期已了，還未繳淸，校長也就把他抹去了。如今申報讀者叻學金的頒布，他渴望着能助他究戚學業。（S）</p>

<h3>美孚大量汽油被扣　已向海關交涉</h3>

<p>美孚油公司運油船美耀號、載油駛往長江口岸、遭日方扣留多日、現該船雖巳釋出、然所載之油一千六百筒、（每筒五加侖）被日方藉口沒收、關於此事、昨據美孚公司某員聲稱、該公司刻與江海關當局直接磋商、以期收回該批油類、該員對於此間日海軍發言人所稱美耀號運油接濟華方游擊隊一節、切實吾認、據稱、美耀號運油被扣、絕非政治事件、但係海關事件、該船諒係在技術上違背江海關條例、故就此方面求其解決、現美耀號巳由海關交還美孚公司、</p>
<p>竟稱接濟華遊擊隊</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（八日）日方招待新聞記者席上披露、日方巳將美孚油公司運油船美耀號交還該公司、惟該船所載之油二千筒、則加沒收、緣日海軍查悉美耀號被扣時、係受某華商號租用、運油接濟刻仍扼守長江北岸一帶之華方游擊隊、而美耀號企圖卸油之新港、乃游擊隊所據守之口岸云、按美耀號係八月四日被日方扣留、旋交江海關、轉交美孚公司、現泊美孚碼頭、</p>

<p>美署遺失槍械</p>
<p>事緣工部局警務處近接滬西界外馬路區送來之槍械若干支、要求在公共租界登記、警務處當加檢騐、查得此等槍械、實係美按署之物、美當局開訊、因鐵氏身爲副執行官、竟未報告失槍事、遂請警務處將鐵氏逮捕、查鐵氏會在本市某無綫電臺任報告員、歷時未久、數月前、入美按署任副執行官、以代返美作短期旅行之美按署執行官李却遜、</p>
<p>各方頗為哄動</p>
<p>今晨鐵氏被捕之訊、各方頗爲哄動、因鐵氏近會緝獲「吃角子老虎大王」傑克拉萊、故知鐵氏之名者頗多也、關於鐵氏被捕原因、外界傳說不一、惟美當局與警務處均嚴守緘默、鐵氏就逮經過不詳、僅聞渠係遭西探長克賴埃登及其他兩警員所拘捕、移押華德路西牢、美按署方面係檢察官希爾資邀警務處警員赴其按署辦公室、請往逮捕鐵氏、</p>

<h3>醫藥界的新貢獻　余發明治癆專藥</h3>
<p>本埠新亞樂廠生物研究所所長余　，是美國哈佛大學醫學博士，曾任中央防疫處技正兼代處長，雷氏德醫學研究院細菌系主任，他是一位十足的細菌學專家。最近以研究結晶，發明一種治療癆病專藥，名曰「抗癆素」，巳經在中國紅十字會第三醫院及其他各大醫院施用，效力顯著，實在是醫藥界上之一大貢獻。</p>
<p>余博士說：「上海兒童，在十四歲以下　癆病者，爲百分之六十一，成年以上，每年的有十萬人，因癆病而死者，年的五百名左右，此數爲世界之社，實屬駭人聽副」。</p>
<p>記者詢以癆症之種類，余博士說，計有八九種之多，若腸癆，肺癆，腎癆，骨癆，喉癆，瘰癧頸癆，眼及皮膚癆；普通患肺癆者居多數，惟喉癆患者不多。凡患癆病之人，其體內必有結核菌，此菌可以傳染他人，侵入肺臟，即成肺癆；侵入骨骼，即成骨癆；侵入腸管皮膚腎臟，以及淋巴腺，均可成癆。肺癆的結核菌，隨痰而出，骨癆皮膚癆瘰癧之結核菌，則隨膿而出。腸癆之結核菌，隨糞而出，腎癆之結核菌，則隨尿而出。</p>
<p>「　癆素」經余博士悉心研究，功效顯著，認爲係治療各種癆病之特效藥。對于各期癆病，均可根冶。</p>
<p>記者昨日到新亞與余博士暢談後，並參觀該所各部，烘箱問內洪製細菌玻璃管，說明箱內之熱度，常在三千度左右，使管內細菌蔓延生殖，幷出示巳上烘箱及未上烘箱之細菌玻璃管，加以詳細說明。（小植）</p>

<h3>怎樣研究植物學（二）</h3>
<p>— 袁善徵</p>
<p>（三）怎樣研究植物學</p>
<p>（甲）研究的方法　研究的原則和方法、大致和動物學相同、茲再提出幾種簡便易行的方法、寫在下面</p>
<p>一、隨時隨地留心觀察　植物的生長、四時皆有、並且四時不同、有的在春季發長、至夏季枯死、有的在廈季發生、至秋季或冬季枯死、有的在春季生葉、夏季開花、秋季結果、過了時機、便不易找到適當的材料、所以我們要研究植物的外部形態、發育狀况、以及和環境的關係、非隨時地留心研究、不能得到正確的知識、</p>
<p>二、利用顯徵鏡觀察內部構造　顯微鏡是研究植物學的重要工具、我們把植物的器官、如根·莖·葉等切成薄片、裝在玻璃片內、放在顯微鏡下、仔細觀察、便知道內部的細胞及組織、還有下等植物藻類植物）如水綿·新月藻·硅藻等、可直接夾在玻璃片內、用顯微鏡放大觀察、非常有趣、</p>
<p>三、栽培植物　我們要知道植物的繁殖作用、生長狀態、營養生理、非親目裁培植物不能明瞭、栽培的地方、不必廣大、如庭前花盆　可、栽培的植物如馬鈴薯的塊莖、能從眼狀構造裹、長出芽來、移植土中、能長出新植物來、又如蠶豆或大豆的種子、埋在土中、能發芽生長、菊花或薔薇的嫩枝摔入土中、每日洒水、能生根發長、可以實騐植物的繁殖作用、可以常常觀察生長狀况、節省到野外的時間、還可以用培養液試騐植物的營養、和生長的關係、例如缺少鉀素或鐵素、均不能使植物充分發長也、</p>

<h3>金融　外匯奔騰至午方回</h3>
<p>英匯再創空前緊價收盤轉定</p>
<p>匯豐漸有美金供給扒風頓挫</p>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐九點三十分掛牌、英匯縮一八七五、出現二便士八一二五空前緊價、美滙縮六二五、計四元六八七五、法德日仍無市、印港等滙亦劇縮、英美滙暗市先緊後回、乃於晨開後、華商首扒美金四元八一二五及七五均難獲、進口洋行亦結進、聞日銀行均有扒補、故聞滙豐小櫃檯美滙縮至四元六八七五、故亦步緊至與上價同、英金亦見二便士八一二五新緊價、詛至九點三刻、聞滙豐供售美金四元七五、扒風頓挫、美商銀行亦有供給、故漸回硬、美金至四元八一二五、終英平、美稍軋緊、交易轉稀、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>日商投機同時進取</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市英美滙仍無伸縮、各國匯兌英滬縮〇六二五、美滬縮一分、餘平、中央掛牌各滙皆平、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英匯二便士八四三七五、美金四元八一二五、均與上日收價同、因聞日商銀行仍在暗中補進、進口商及投機家亦爭先扒四元八一二五及四元七五、銀行均少供意、匯豐掛牌下縮、白銀平衡稅仍徵百分二二四·二五、小櫃檯美匯亦縮至四元六八七五、故亦軟至銀行僅肯照上價供給、英金亦緊至二便士八一二五、俄聞匯豐供售八月四元七五、美商銀行供意亦轉濃、扒風頓息、美行售八月四元七八一二五予進口商、當見回賤至四元八一二五可售、英金亦見回硬、午刻局勢較穩、正午收市現貨至九月期均英匯二士便八四三七五、美金四兀七八一二五、（亦有還四元八一二五）、比上日英平、美緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>天津英美一致緊縮</p>
<p>天津九日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤仍告呆滯、倫敦電匯緊一二五、爲三便士三一二五、紐約電滙縮二五、爲五元五六二五、申匯降七角半、爲八十六元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤昂二角半、爲五十五元二角五分、</p>
<h3>項價迭現　金潮險惡</h3>
<p>七二二〇元高價見後　向上之人心始行動搖</p>
<p>昨日烚赤暗市、雖值週六上午半日營業、風浪依然險惡、始猛漲、繼突回疲、七千二百元大關飛出後、瞬即回入、各方、致向上之人心、後已動搖、蓋於晨開後、囚香港電滙米到、致起香滙滙豐銀行有停止掛脾推測本市外匯銀行少供意、乃趨猛緊、塲內一部份滬西幫軋空、立泰傾進萬兩、證券號金號銀銀號等亦有收吸、故在散多抬風中、飛見七千二百二十元新高價、後聞匯豐照常掛牌、且有美令四　七五售出、人心始定、而多頭大感失望、且金號幫成紀·合　出籠、另一部份滬西幫加碼再售、證券幫復出、致回退亦速遜、至七千一百元左右、終尚軋升六十八元、本日交易十三四萬兩、下午週六無市、現金交易日少、益大出祥和四十兩、及銀樓幫二十兩、順源出時和十兩、價再見八千八百八十元空前高蜂、再漲八十元、致飾金亦創九百十元、有掛牌來從未到過新高價、</p>
<p>期貨已連升五天</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市、爲七千〇九十元、比前日收價高二十五元、决見七千〇八十元、忽有利多傳說、立泰·益大·祥和·恒記·義元·時和·德成及散戶等四起傾進、價遂飛出七千一百元外、上升更速、再出七千二百元關，共步升一百四十元、哄達七千二百二十元高價、後聞美滙已止緊、滙豐有售出、人心始定、成記·德孚·益大·鼎盛·大豐·合盛來在售、頓起回風、下跌亦銳、及聞美金四元八一二五亦可結、祥興永·明豐·新豐永·義元等亦爭售、滬西幫加碼、價回瀉亦一百四十元、遜至七千〇八十元、時立泰又來補進、熾大·益大·新豐永亦購、美金稍軟、價又一哄一百元、見七千一百八十元、德孚·合盛·成記再出、小至七千一百十元、俄父抬上、午收七千一百三十三元、比前日再漲六十八元、查已述升五天之久、共漲四百五十二元、且八月美金四元七八一二五結價、爲七千二百八十三元、計撳一百五十元、收後升至七千一百四十二元、又回小至七千一百二十五元、半日有一百四十元高低、下午塲外未聞做開無價、現金號之本脾金、門市售出八千九百五十元、收進减二百元、現標金無市、</p>
<p>飾金懸九百十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行於上午十點掛升十元、達九百十元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>美鈔高開廿一元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤期現俱漲、英美金鎊因亦續漲五元、英金票趨勢堅穩、市價站平、美金票開盤二千零三十五元、開後仁泰永·志成等購買、抬至七十元、聯合順源振和祥源永利記等售出、退爲三十元、盈泰同興等購買、又高至四十五元、午收二千零四十二元、比上日軋升十六元、現貨高至二十一元、香港票趨勢益俏、晚市高至五元六角半、日金票站平、晚市仍站二元三角原盤、朝鮮票續趨漲勢、晚市高至一元八角四分、</p>
<h3>糧食　為日泰關係微妙　洋米又在重掀風浪</h3>
<p>昨日洋米漲風愈烈、期現各米無不飛黃騰達、蓋囤戶心思本來望好、一經滙水暴縮與泰日緊漲之刺激、允使囤戶增加興奮、而拋頂宮與踢皮球之流、莫不應時興起、趁機活躍、兼以咋日風潮終止、市塲外潮水退後、業內外客囤與本街舖作鄕莊內地等戶均行到市問津、市塲空氣頓見緊張、而買聲騰沸、市面越抬越高、現小絞漲到一百廿六元、一號西貢到一百三十七元半、又二號到一百二十六元半、碎米亦到九十七元、暹邏一號與敏黨等中關貨均開到一百三十元、火紋至一百三十三元半、而英華司交易亦頗活潑、小絞英華司到達一百五十三元、碎米到一百零九元半、二號暹米到一百四十三元半、比之前日激漲三四五元不等之鉅、繼聞新昌盛有即裝小絞一千噸售開、價祇一百五十元而實銷本呆、囤戶膽怯縮手、市乃立即反漲爲跌、猛落一二三元不一、然比之前日收價仍較大一二元、小絞英華司（一石二斗半）又自一百五十二元半一百五十一元六角至一百五十一元、二號暹邏一百四十二元半一百四十二元一百四十一元三角、現小絞回至一百二十三元半、全日成交現米二萬包、英華司一千二百噸云、計現貨收盤一號西貢爲百三十六元、中關百三十三四元、二號百二十四元半、百二十四元、高百二十六元半、二號暹邏百二十四元、敏黨高百四十元、中關百三十一元、百三十元、决百二十六七元、茄佛米百三十一元半、百三十一元、銀行棧小紋百二十四元、外棧百二十三元、東京砶尖百十六元、碎尖高自九十六元决至九十一元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、來源寥落、且兼洋米一再高漲之際、心思一律趨昂、行情並漲二元、開南港早晚稻百五十三元半至百五十元、無錫原包白粳百四十七元、浦東新粳更以時鮮關係、故雖身骨較柔、亦續增二元、計做開六担、價爲百五十九元</p>
<p>糯米國貨、因來源久斷、市貨亦罄、香港白元、以洋米馬首是瞻、並亦帶高二元左右、開高自白二十六元、次至黃色百二十元、糯菉百十五元、至百十三元、</p>
<h3>麵粉跟漲何其速</h3>
<p>昨現洋粉市况、急轉猛升、查客銷方面、自天津米麵在漲後、北洋客囤、進胃漸貪、更兼日本南進消息、復　塵上、人心莫不向榮、本街實銷與散囤競購之下、金龍粉開盤由卅二元五角抬至卅二元八角、及砲臺粉卅三元九角、鐘樓牌卅四元四五角、比上日各升近元、尚有雜牌魚鳥卅二元八角、及香蕉牌卅三兀、市面一致上展、惟午後情勢轉懈、因有囤戶川籠、金龍粉退至世一元六角及五角、其他各貨尚在互擯、市面前途、因漲度太速、其勢暫難過好、</p>
<p>小麥來源、因風雨到貨寥落、日華各粉廠雖經放價收買、卒無相當現貨可收、聞日廠門市每日收進約有二三百包、而華廠方面堪稱絕無僅有、各廠進價、悉無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　廠紗時有套賣　日紗雖昂猶難抬頭</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼跌、但局勢又覺混亂、此因人心不一、同時現紗交易不及上日之輿盛、至於外匯雖縮、標金在騰、然紗價未能隨之上升、實則環境欠佳、廠方時有套出、且同業心思對於雙馬大都傾向拋空路上、惟證券幫及金子幫皆在多頭地位、兩方之拉力似覺殊强也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百二十五元、低價爲一千五百九十三元、午後因週末向例停市、目前紗市仍在盤檔上、就原料方面着想、紗價不能鬆、照人心而論、多數看疲、原因爲廠家時有套賣、足使市面大受打擊、不過日紗價格甚昂、業外者時有吸收云、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開氣勢平定、因獲利者稍見吐出、首盤價一千六百十五元、旋聞外匯改縮、標金步昂、人心隨之提升、漲至一千六百二十五元、但客銷不旺、金價稍見回挫、市情轉鬆、跌至一千六百〇五元、空頭扒補、又復回至一千六百十四元、迨至收盤時、忽然下落、爲廠方有套出、人氣虛怯、爲一千五百九十三元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千一百二十五包、茲將各幫賣去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一二五同行七、〇〇〇統計七、一二五</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市況、免起鶻落、走勢殊為紊亂、當上午開出、雖美棉續跌第以現紗趨堅、人心激昂、故承上日之餘風、再度高騰、八月期開盤爲一四七二元、即高升三元、入後繼續上漲、昂達一四八〇元、九月期開川一五五五·〇〇、漲上八元、會高至一五六〇·〇〇、十月期開盤爲一五六五·〇〇、高價做開、故入後第二三盤因金市與現紗轉軟、多頭遂起浮動、乃先後脫手、賣氣旺盛、竟不出本報所料、頓見回跌、結果八月期以一四六五·〇〇、九月期一五三五·〇〇、十月期一五四九·〇〇收市、各降四元至十五元不等、綜觀走勢、若現紗客銷不動、期紗當亦難堅、惟外匯與金市前途頗多波盪、是以紗市變幻殊有隨之上落之可能、惟以實銷所繫、共上升之潛力、恐有遜於下墜之有勁也、父昨上午半日共成交八千五百二十包、比上日减少五千一百六十包、又截至八日止三個月存賑數骨、爲二萬四千五百五十包、內八月期存六千五百包、九月期存九千二百二十包、十月期存八千八百三十包、賣方以二號空四千五百八十包、十六號空二千三百八十包、六十七號空一千五百五十包、五十二號空一千一百五十包、六十一號空一千〇五十包、買方以五十八號多一千〇八十包，十四號多九百七十包、五號多九百三十包、七號多八百十包、三十五號多七百四十包、茲列全日經過之市價、列表於後、</p>
<h3>美政府　棉產報告減少</h3>
<p>華盛頓電、美農部棉產報告科發表今年第一屆美棉收穫估計一千〇八十一萬七千包、比去年同時减少六十一萬二千包、其百分狀况當常年七十二分、每畝收穫量爲二百二十四磅四、茲將近五年間同時情形、原電錄左、（單位千包每包五百磅）</p>
<p>又電今年八月一日起至八日止美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<h3>棉商居奇　交易銳減</h3>
<p>現棉情況雖堅、但消費平澹、人心頗挺、執貨者暫時尙無意脫手、間有售意者索價甚高、因外滙改縮、在換算價當然提高、然吃主依然寥寥、交易頓形淸淡云、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉定貨交易、市况仍屬堅昂、而人心興奮、同時各方羅致現貨者、允爲活躍、但因執貨者居奇、及扳價過高、連日成交者仍不多見也、</p>

<h3>電影與兒童敎育</h3>
<p>— 如冰</p>
<p>現代的電影藝術在文化界中，已有了相當的地位，這是不可否認的事實。我們覺得這一種一有聲活動的敎科書」，的確是一種最好的敎育工具，它對於兒童的影響，則更有密切的關係，成人看電影有純為娛樂消遣的，有為使精神上受一點極有益的教育的，但在心理上，知識上所感受的影響，當然也很深刻。</p>
<p>至於兒童看電影，除在娛樂之外，還得着很大的教育作用，童話，寓言，故事固然是兒童的恩物，但它在電影化」以後，那給與兒童的興趣，當更是濃厚，影響更是深刻。</p>
<p>上海的兒童愛好電影的很多，但是現在電影的題材，大都缺乏意義，不滴合兒童去觀看，因爲這些片子對他們的心理上，生理上都有害處。</p>
<p>根據測騐的結果，兒童們最喜歡的是滑稽片，若分別來說：則男孩子們愛好的是：一，武俠片，二，偵探片，三滑稽片，四，探險片。女孩子們愛好是一滑稽片二，探險片，三，偵探片，四：武俠片，他們之間相同的是喜歡滑稽片至於文藝片，傳記片則因為他的知識水準不夠，所以根本不歡迎。</p>
<p>卡通片在兒童們，可以說是十分愛好的，如「白雪公主」，「小人國」「木偶奇遇記」等：都是極有趣，極鮮艷的卡通片，使他們發生濃厚的興趣，和色調的美感，這些對他們心理知識都有裨益。</p>
<p>最要不得的是一些恐怖片，和神怪片等，使兒童們看了受了激刺，以致晚間不能入睡，或睡後生惡夢，像這種影片，最好不讓兒童觀看，免生意外。因此攝製有趣味的教育電影，實是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>除了改良影片外，如影院的座位和光錢，也應該改革，因爲角度不準，距離不合，往往有損兒童的目力，也有因之而變成近視的，這些足以危害兒童生理的缺點，也亟待改進。</p>
<h3>聰明勇敢的威爾</h3>
<p>— 迢遙</p>
<p>上次歐洲大戰的時候，有一個法國的小學生，名叫威爾的，那時他還祇十一歲，跟着他母親住在靠沂巴黎的一個亨利村上，因爲他天資很聰明，又肯用功，所以，非但在學校裹常受人稱讚，就是歸家後，也也常常得到母親糖菓的獎品。</p>
<p>有一大早晨，亨里村上，忽然來了一批零亂慌急的敗兵，人數的在六十以上，像歸窠的老鴉般湧進來，而且個個都是狼狽小堪，沒有槍砲的徒手者，那後面的德軍用着半圓形的形勢包過不來。村後是一條寬闊的大河，河上的橋樑，早已炸燬，河裹又沒有一隻船，這六千多各的士兵怎樣過去呢？大家正在慌急的時候，一個小孩子，忽然挺身出來，很響亮的對大衆說：</p>
<p>『現在很危險了，你們趕快築僑！這裹還有許多木頭，可供應用，至於那後面追擊的由我來設法阻擋，越快越好！』雖然是孩子，但說話的口氣無異大人，他說完後，很快的直向德軍的地方奔去，手裹還　着一面白旗。</p>
<p>他被一個德兵帶進行營。</p>
<p>『你今年幾歲了？』一個軍官模樣的人問。</p>
<p>『十一歲。』</p>
<p>「你一個人來做什麼？不怕嗎？』這軍官的法語並不算好。</p>
<p>『我是代表我們兵士來投降的。』</p>
<p>『我不信，為什麼派你這個小孩子來呢？』</p>
<p>『我們村上的人都已逃光了，士兵們三天三夜沒有吃過東西，他們現在正在吃着，所以，除了我，是再沒有別人了。」說後，那個軍官跑上一個土丘，把望遠鏡向遠處一看，果眞有許多黑影在移動，於是重新跑下來，對孩子說：『你就坐在這裹，等他們吃完了，你就領他們來，知道嗎？』「知道，你去吧。』孩子就坐在那裏。</p>
<p>中等過了，那個軍官兇狠地閻進來問：『怎樣了？』「孩子答道：「他們大概都已逃了吧，從一座簡單的橋上逃去的。』『呸！奸細！』一聲未了，刺刀的尖頭已攅進孩子的喉管，鮮血四濺。</p>
<p>小朋友！他就是聰明勇敢的威爾呀！</p>
<h3>寫信</h3>
<p>— 楊毅</p>
<p>小朋友！你們　裏不是常有信往來的嗎？或是鄰舍拿一封信來要你念給他聽，有時竟要求你爸爸代寫一封信。小朋友，你　念信寫信嗎？如果你小能，爲什麼不學習呢</p>
<p>你們在學校裹做作文，先生出一個題目，你們小常要做不出嗎？有的小朋友，便假造出話來寫在紙上，如果道題目是「給爸爸的信」或「給哥哥的信，」眞不好做，因爲爸爸天天見　實在沒有話說，哥哥或者　沒有呢？</p>
<p>寫信實在眞需要啊！可以練習作文的能力，許多要說的話，把它化成字，又可以聯絡感情像你的先生；同學；遠地的親戚，你如果寫一封信給他們，他們不知多麼歡喜，而連忙給你回信哩。</p>
<p>怎樣寫你的信呢？開頭一個稱呼像××先生××學兄××表弟……下面便要說什麼便說什麼像兩個人講話一樣，問問他的身體，好不好，學問進步不進步……如果寫給比你學問好的人，還可以請他替你改正，指導你的錯誤。</p>
<p>像舊式寫信寫給父母要用「膝下敬稟者，」平輩要什麼「大鑒，茲啟者」之類，我們初學的人用不到，關於寫信的方法，小朋友可以參閱寫信的書</p>
<p>小朋友，你們爲什麼不試試看呢？寫信是有對象的作文，不會枯燥乏味的，祝你們成功。</p>
<h3>西瓜燈</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>長長的暑假期，僅僅過了四分之一，還有四分之三的光陰，正冉冉來到。小朋友們，在這署假期裹，最感到有興趣的工作，是圖畫，剪影，（剪貼）祇摺，和竹木等各種午工，似乎比讀書寫字等刻版功課更來得精神抖擻。原因是：孩子們的個性多好動。現在筆者將「西瓜燈」的製法，寫些出來，介紹給諸位小朋友：西瓜是目前最應時的冷飲品，吃剩的西瓜皮，除了加鹽曝晒和醬炒供餐外，製西瓜燈」的工藝，是再好也沒有了。</p>
<p>西瓜燈的製法，並不繫難，很籣單，先將西瓜一枚，（最好用子白勸白皮白的三白瓜（「揀小　圓形的）用刀割去瓜藤處一小半（約去三分之一）瓜蓋，然後挖去瓜瓤及瓜子，再將瓜皮用銅匙或搪瓷匙，刮至極薄，使皮薄透明，發出綠油油的光彩來，（須注　瓜皮不宜刮得過薄防洞穿）第一步工作完成之後，第二步工作，便將厚馬糞紙，剪成圓形，（舊時銀餅般大小）燭底板兩張，串以粗鉛絲，夾縛於瓜底內外，同時燭底板圓心中央，即以粗鉿絲，做一寸許長的燭扦。此工作完成後，第三步工作是將淡墨筆在瓜壳四週，繪上山水，花卉，人物，或走獸，或虫豸，或繪開國元勛孫中山先生像，或繪當今世界民治國偉人，羅斯福，邱吉爾，史太林，蔣委員長等像，從心所欲，要盡得栩栩欲活。如果要簡單些，或者畫畫梅蘭竹石……盡好之後，再取鋒利的脚力，順着筆路，輕輕雕去，露出更透明的形像來，再以鉛絲穿在瓜頂邊，三角式掛起來，夜晚，燃以白禮氏小洋燭，或小紅燭，插上瓜底的燭扦，一盞西瓜燈便完成了。那麼小巧玲瓏，那麼靑綠景色，或人影幢幢，眞覺得淸逸可愛！記得我童年時代，我的已故從堂兄然千君，最擅此道，畫得好，雕得巧，爲家長所讚歎。苟此製「西瓜燈」小工藝玩意，能够匠心獨造，發揚光大，我想一西瓜燈」在暑天的玩具市塲上，必佔得百席，善價而沽，又是一樁「生意興隆生財有道」的小工藝事業。</p>
<h3>饅頭</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>因為米價飛漲到一百多元一担，所以阿慧家裏買了幾袋麵粉，作為米的代食品，這樣米的消費比較可以節省，也就是節省一些支出。的確，在這樣米珠薪桂的年頭，無論什麼事都在「挖打」，力求節省到最低的限度。</p>
<p>今天，阿慧家又要做饅頭了，早晨他媽媽在買小菜時，帶了一塊酵母回來，它外面有錫紙包着，酵母的顏色是灰白的，活像一塊蔴菇豆腐乾。</p>
<p>「哥哥，酵母是什麼？是什麼東西做成的？」阿慧耳聽得媽媽說着：這是一塊酵母。這兩個怪陌生而叉新鮮的名字，在他簡單的腦海中，絲亳沒有印象，看上去再像塊豆腐乾也沒有了。他便拿着它，去請教阿明了。</p>
<p>「酵母是我們眼睛所看不見的一種有生命的植物，其中有不知多少的單細胞植物組成的，除非你在顯微鏡放大了去觀察，才能使你相信，吾則你無論如何是不會相信的。酵母有好有壞，像食物隔了夜，便不好吃了，漿糊多放了幾天，便發黃綠的霉花，而且變得很臭，這些都是壞的酵母作祟，而做饅頭用的酵母都是有益於我們的。它們小得只有千分之一厘米左右的大小，它是無色，略帶橢圓形的小粒，小雖很小，可是它們的生殖本領却很高明的，它們怎樣生出小酵母呢？因爲它們是一粒單細胞，只要把一個單細胞一分爲二，這樣便變成兩個新細胞，所以小酵母的大小和形狀和老酵母完全一樣，簡直不像母子，而是一對雙生子了。再由二分為四，四分為八，八分為十六，十六分爲三十二，……愈分愈多，一直分到不知多少。要是它們所住的地方不大適意，它們便不再用這種分裂生殖，而在老酵母細胞的一端生出一二個像瘤樣東西，愈生愈大，後來那瘤狀的東西都和老細胞脫離關係，這樣便成了一個新的酵母，但比校原來的小了一些，還有點像母子，這叫做出芽生殖。這就是關於酵母的大概。」</p>
<p>阿慧也不再多問下去，因爲他媽媽叫他把那塊酵母拿來，後來只見得媽媽把酵母溶在溫水裹，更混和在麵粉裏。隔了兩三個鐘頭，那一堆麵粉竞「腫」了起來，阿慧看得發呆，這時阿明也走了過來，才把他的呆看打斷了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你看那放在而盆裹的一團麵粉，現在竟「腫」成滿滿的一面盆了。這是不是酵母的力量？爲什麼能使麵粉「腫」脹的？」阿慧又好奇的問着。</p>
<p>「這當然完全是酵母的力量，要知道酵母是一種很活潑的植物，當它溶在水裏，溫和到麵粉中，這裡須注意溶酵母的水不可過分的熱，否則酵母被熱水燙死了，因爲它們也是有生命的。當它們和入麵粉中後，便覺得很悶，而且它們也需要呼吸的。更要知道麵粉富有澱粉質，而糖是由澱粉做成的。所以當酵母關在麵粉內，常它們行呼吸作用時，便把澱粉分解而吸收共中的養氣，而把二養化炭氣放出來，便在麵粉團裏形成許多小孔，而使澱粉變成酒精，你不信去嗅嗅那脹起的麵粉，一定有些酒氣。這和我們人類的呼吸作用樣，可見凡是有生命的生物，都有這呼吸作用。這又叫做發酵作用，對於我們很有益處，如不經發酵的饅頭，硬而不好吃，而且不易消化，一經發酵，人人都歡迎的了。」</p>
<p>當阿明講完了這話，更經阿慧細細的去觀察，才證實了他哥哥所講的一些也不錯，這是阿慧的特有的科學精神，小朋友們，你們是不是也是這樣的？</p>

<h3>寶蓮高黛談卓別麟</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>數年來，卓別麟和寳蓮高黛的關係，始終是若即若離，誰也猜不透他們到底結婚與吾。直到「大獨裁者」在百老匯「都會大戲院獻映的時候，卓氏會親自登豪，與觀衆相見，並爲寳蓬高黛介紹，稱她爲「卓別麟夫人」，於是寳蓮高黛的名份，在這句話中正式確定了。本文便是她以妻子的資格來談卓別麟，頗爲別致，特譯之以饗讀者。</p>
<p>「嫁給卓氏，好像是住在一個時常爆發的火山的頂上。」寳蓮很知足地說，在她的眼光中告訴你，她是非常的滿意。「如果你希望我形容一個好丈夫，我可以很簡單的說，他不是個好丈夫，但是他是個興奮有趣的人，相處在一起，對我却是個極優良的丈夫了。因爲我喜歡這樣的共同生活，我喜歡過着危險而刺激的生活。他不懂得甚麼是怕懼，他不怕生命的危險和將來事業的危險，任何事他是無畏懼的。有時，深更半夜或將天亮三四點鐘的時候，他醒來開了汽車到海邊去觀日出，於是在那兒早餐，他以愈瘋在而愈開心。</p>
<p>「普通女子能從她的丈夫處得到安慰，」寳蓮繼續地說：「但是我不能希望卓氏也會賜給我，她是始終不守時刻的，如果他說七點鐘回來進晚餐，他竟會遲至八九點鐘，或六點鐘以前就回來了。所以，一切食物必須預先弄好，等他進大門，廚娘就開出來。這樣他才能滿意。他對於約會常常會忘記的，同時對於出入帳務也不注意，雖然我也不慣於這些。但是我也只得爲他當心。</p>
<p>「思慮到別人，是他所最不擅長的。細小的事件他永不會記得，如果我希望要得到什麼生日禮，那要我自己去指示和選擇的，他從來不想到，送什麼紀念品或禮物花朵之類，聖誕他也是如此的，以爲應該有聖誕，但無須慶祝，他不願有什麼聖誕賀柬放在房中。不過，去年聖誕却例外，他送我一條金練索，掛着一個鷄心，而裹面有他自己的照片，這也許因爲「大獨裁者」功德圓滿的緣故！</p>
<p>「卓氏好像世上只有他一人生存着，以爲多活六十秒鐘，就可以趕六十秒鐘的路程。」寳蓮笑着說，這笑是從內心發出來的。「雖然他沒有伶俐的口才，但却能寫得一手流利的文字，所以他很喜歡和聰明智慧的人談話。他的嗜好是打獵，釣魚，看小說，並且注意世界新聞，他的一切熱情均蘊藏在內心，表面上他絕不對你有熱力的表示。</p>
<p>對於卓氏，寳蓮忸怩地說：「沒有人能够了解他，有時他很守舊，但有時他却像一個頑皮的壞孩子，他會做出俏皮的狡猾的態度煩惱別人，也很喜捉住別人的弱點而笑弄人。他又是　於撒謊者，你分辨不出他說的是眞是似，但是對於重大的事情就不如此。因爲他只是將不重要的事情說說笑笑而已。……」</p>
<p>「鈴！鈴……」是卓氏的電話來了，於是打斷了她的語句</p>

<p>詞人遂在舟中做起詩來。圓圓代他慶墨。一路回轉橫塘，詞人已成詩二十首，眞有太白倚馬之才了。這夜詞人在圓圓粧閣裹吃了晚飯，喝得醉釀醺地，方始坐舟回城。這天夜裹，圓圓睡夢中還像在山上游玩，轉瞬不見了詞人，天上忽然湧起一團烏雲，大風刮得呼呼地嚮，好似要下陣雨的樣子。伊心中正在慌張，忽見花蝴蝶領了一夥人，從山下跑上來，手夏拿着兵器，又像是一羣强盜，要來刦奪自已。伊驚極而號，醒來時乃是南柯一夢，唬出一身冷汗。想想這夢很是不鮮。旣而想夢由心生，這是因爲自己日間遇見了花蝴蝶，心裹不大愉快，故有這夢。勉强鎭定着心神，重復入睡。决日上午，天氣忽又陰霾，像要下雨的樣子。春天的天氣本來是變幻無常的，睛雨無定，昨臼今朝大不同了。圓圓早晨起身後，梳洗畢，用過午餐，便坐在書桌前，取出惜玉詞人咋天舟中所咏的二十首春游詩的卿稿，一首一首的重錄在浣花箋上。圓圓的小楷寫得非常秀麗勻潔，足見伊的蘭心蕙質了。下午，窗外廉織細雨，花木全濕，圓圓佔料詞入今天不來了，最好，別的客人也沒有來，可使自己休息休息。誰知傍晚時，伊的粧閣裹忽然來了一位貴客，當他來的時候，門前騶從如雲，聲勢赫奕，左右鄰居都很驚奇地探問那位貴客是誰？圓圓的家人奔走不遑地伺候佳賓。但是圓圓一見道位老翁，認得就是昨天在靈岩山上相逢的那位貴人，不由心裏一怔。更使伊大大憎惡的，就是緊隨着那老翁身後的一個少年，乃是伊避之若凂的花蝴蝶。（一三八）</p>

<h3>Major Democratic Nations of England and America to Adopt Joint Strong Action, Cannot Stand Idly By Regarding Japan's Southern Advance or Northern Attack, and Recognize the Soviet Union as a Bulwark Against Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch: Observers here stated yesterday that current discussions between England and America may result in a united and powerful warning to Japan from various strong nations. The extent to which this warning is issued or not made explicit will depend on future developments. However, it seems very clear that this warning is not an empty threat. Such a warning may include: (1) Democratic nations increasing practical assistance to the Soviet Union; (2) England and America strengthening defenses in the Western Pacific; (3) Eliminating Japan's existing doubts about England, America, and Australia considering the integrity of the Dutch East Indies extremely important to their security; (4) England and America taking action to demonstrate that they cannot stand idly by regarding Japan's attack on the Soviet Union. The final decision of the democratic nations regarding the attitude towards Thailand will be clarified after the conclusion of the talks between England and America. According to reports, Japan has already established a strong base on the border between Vietnam and Thailand. Apparently, England considers Japan's actions to undermine Thailand's independence as a most serious development. However, how England will respond to this challenge will largely depend on America's actions. Observers here believe that the U.S. Constitution does not allow President Roosevelt to make threats of war before Japan takes any action in Thailand or the Dutch East Indies. If Japan disregards the warnings of the democratic nations and controls Thailand, England and America will at least impose absolute restrictions on Japan within the non-warfare scope. At that time, Japan's second aggression will automatically become a war. However, observers solemnly point out that this is Japan's perspective. It is believed that from next week onwards, Japan will no longer have the possibility of doubting the determination of the democratic nations. It is also believed that the democratic nations will make it clear in some form that even if Japan declares that it will no longer advance south, it will not be able to "buy back" England and America's view that Japan threatens the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is considered a defensive bulwark against Germany. However, it is doubtful whether the United States will allow Japan to prevent the transport of American goods to the Soviet Union. Observers believe that there is no doubt about the common determination of the United States and England to ensure the security of Singapore.</p>
<h3>Canada Takes Precautions Along the Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 9th Dispatch: Canadian Minister of National Defence Ralston stated last night that Canada, in view of the situation in the Far East, has taken all necessary precautions along the Pacific coast. The 6th Division of the Canadian active army is currently being mobilized.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 9th Dispatch: Minister of National Defence Ralston stated that the new Canadian army will be allocated to locations on various battlefields that require reinforcements.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 9th Dispatch: Minister of Aviation McEwen stated yesterday that the Imperial Far East Air Force, including Australian Air Force units in Malaya, is powerful enough to cope with any war crisis in the region. He also said that significant progress has been made in strengthening the strength of the Imperial Air Force in Malaya. He stated that the government has further ordered aircraft for transporting large armies for the use of the Royal Australian Air Force, but can transport other troops if necessary.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 9th Dispatch: Opposition newspapers also demanded yesterday that England and America should express a stronger attitude towards Japan and advised Japan to act cautiously. The Straits Times stated that England and America should quickly announce their willingness to immediately assist Thailand. If England and America clearly express their willingness to go to war with Japan, war in the Pacific can be avoided. The Singapore Daily News, which is run by the Japanese and serves as the mouthpiece of the Japanese authorities, stated that if Japan wants to advance southward through Burma or Thailand, it is simply crazy. Burma can independently cope with the current Japanese military threat in Vietnam with plenty to spare. Thailand resists Japan's southward advance. In this situation, if Japan attempts to act rashly, it cannot be considered crazy. It is thought that not all Japanese are so foolish. If Japan's activities are limited to within China and Vietnam, England and America will not take military action against it.</p>
<h3>Defensive Preparations in Burma are Thorough, the Army is on Standby</h3>
<p>Reuters, Yangon, 9th Dispatch: A group of journalists visited a certain area near Yangon. All those who knew the situation in Yangon an hour ago were deeply moved. The allocation of all Burmese military forces and equipment, and the continuous arrival of the latest equipment, now only allow one to know a little about the overall situation. Burma's defense preparations have never been announced, but today a spokesperson has assured that the Burmese military is now on standby to fulfill its responsibilities. Burma's defense thoroughness is no less than that of other parts of the Imperial Far East.</p>
<h3>Talks Between American and British Leaders Have Not Yet Officially Begun, American Officials Continue to Leave Washington, Rumor Has It That Stalin Will Also Participate</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch: A telegram from the US President's yacht stated that the President is currently sailing safely at sea and spent all day on Friday reviewing official documents. The yacht and escort ship, the River Sioux, recently approached the coast to load fuel, fresh water, and food. The whereabouts of the yacht were not mentioned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch: Amidst rumors of a meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, two senior government officials left here again yesterday. It has been confirmed that the most recent departures were Under Secretary of State Welles and General Piers, an assistant to Hopkins. According to the State Department, Welles' departure is for a "short vacation," and no further details were given. The whereabouts of General Piers have not yet been reported. His friends are all very "surprised" by Piers' trip.</p>
<p>Havas, Budapest, 8th Dispatch: The "Hungarian Newspaper" reported that the US President and the British Prime Minister will meet somewhere, and because Stalin will also participate, it is extremely secret.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 9th Dispatch: A London correspondent for the Nihde Newspaper reported yesterday that the talks between England and America are not specifically related to any one event, but are a general discussion. In addition to issues related to the transport of American goods to England, the German-Soviet war is also the focus of the talks. London believes that British and Soviet navies may cooperate to protect the transport of British and American aid to the Soviet Union. London military experts further pointed out that Germany may attack British interests in the Near East from Ukraine, and Egypt will also become a target of its attacks. Therefore, it is planned to explain British interests in Iran and Egypt. French-German relations are also one of the centers of discussion, but the most important point, at least on the British side, will focus on the Far East issue. Britain has made it clear that Japan's acquisition of a foothold in Thailand is a direct threat to British interests and that Britain must take the necessary measures. The correspondent concluded that as a result of this meeting, England and America may announce a common policy.</p>
<h3>Japan Also Denies Making Demands on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>International, London, 9th Dispatch: This question was still firmly believed yesterday that Japan had formally or semi-officially made demands to the Soviet Union, but Japan rejected this news as "pure fabrication." The London Daily Mail reported that the day's demands included the following: (1) Demilitarization of the Vladivostok area; (2) Establishing a garrison area on the Soviet "Manchurian" border; (3) The Soviet Union permitting Japan to have economic rights in Siberia; (4) Not transferring any strategically important bases to the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 8th Dispatch: The Roman People's Newspaper stated that if the news that Japan has made a request to the Soviet Union is true, then Japan directly does not want to allow the United States to supply the Soviet Union through Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 8th Dispatch: Official circles here have denied rumors that Japan has made a number of conditions to the Soviet government.</p>
<h3>Mass Declares in Honolulu That the U.S. Navy is Powerful, The Capital of Any Country Endangering U.S. Policy Can Be Reduced to Rubble Overnight</h3>
<p>Reuters, Honolulu, 9th Dispatch: Republican Congressman Maas of Minnesota told reporters yesterday that the U.S. Navy is powerful enough to "reduce the capital of any country that endangers our national policy to rubble overnight." Although Maas did not directly mention the location, it clearly referred to Tokyo. He recently completed six weeks of active duty in the Navy, during which he served as a Marine Corps colonel. He stated that the U.S. Navy is the most powerful in the world and believes that the U.S. Navy can promote any policy decided by the government. Referring to his previous speech at the Rotary Club, in which he said that no navy in the world could speak of long-term war preparation, he said, "Anyone who thinks that we are not prepared and takes a gamble will have to regret it." He also said that the naval and air personnel of any country in the world cannot compare with those of the United States, and there will be considerable progress in the future. He continued as a congressman, predicting that the day is coming when the United States will build as many as 50 aircraft carriers. He also said that he would recommend a major increase in Hawaii's defenses and would fight again for the fortification of Guam. His first step will be to recommend the opening of large-scale landing sites in the Hawaiian area. He also said that in a short period of time, there has been amazing progress in Midway Island, Wake Island, and Strong Island. He learned of this situation during his recent visits to these areas.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Overall Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>After repeatedly eroding Vietnam, Japan has mobilized a large army and headed to the Northeast, waiting for an opportunity to move. On the other hand, it has stationed troops on the border of Thailand, demanding "cooperation." On the democratic nations' side, in addition to England and America sending parallel notes to Thailand, stating their willingness to provide support, and China strengthening its Southwest defenses to prepare for any eventuality, President Roosevelt suddenly met with Prime Minister Churchill at this time to discuss the overall situation in the Far East, and it is rumored that Stalin and Special Envoy Hopkins, who had just returned from the Soviet Union, also participated in the event. All of this proves that both the aggressors and the anti-aggression front in the Far East have been swift in preparing to carry out a "showdown" in the near future. On the eve of this approaching storm, although the world has full confidence that "the light is not far away," it must face all the events that may be encountered with the greatest courage.</p>
<p>Under the intensified economic blockade by England and America, Japan is clearly in a difficult situation. Retreating would damage its "prestige" and even shake its "national foundation." In the future, it will have to risk "breaking out." Recently, Tokyo newspapers and Ishii and others have repeatedly used the encirclement of China, England, America, and the Netherlands as a pretext. This is the preparation work by the Japanese authorities to stimulate the people before taking action. But according to the actual situation, if Japan invades Thailand, China, England, and Burma will be the first to bear the brunt. For the sake of self-defense, they will inevitably launch a joint and active confrontation. At the same time, the United States has previously launched a freeze on funds and a ban on oil shipments to Japan due to the Vietnam issue. In the future, it will inevitably implement more severe sanctions against Japan due to the occupation of Thailand, so as to echo the military actions of China, England, and Burma. As a result, a major war will inevitably break out immediately in the South Pacific. At that time, the involvement of the Dutch East Indies, Australia, the Philippines, and even the United States in the vortex is only a matter of time. Considering that the united front of various democratic countries in the Far East has been deployed for years and has already taken shape, the world cannot help but ask how much real strength Japan still has militarily to dare to confront this united front with infinite reinforcements, and even more to ask how many days can Japan support the economic blockade war launched by England and America? Assuming that Japan occupies Thailand and can conquer Singapore in one fell swoop and spy on the Dutch East Indies, the South Pacific will certainly evolve into a situation where Japan dominates. If not, Japan will inevitably be defeated, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Japan may "attack the north after feigning the south," superficially oppressing Thailand and making a posture of resolutely advancing south, so as to divert the attention of England and America, but in reality, it is waiting for the "opportune moment" in the German-Soviet war to stab the Soviet Union in the back—Vladivostok. The advantage of this move is that the dangers that may be encountered are not as great as advancing south, and from a strategic point of view, it may eliminate the greatest threat to the Japanese mainland, because if the Far East Red Army takes Vladivostok as a base and sends aircraft to bomb North Manchuria, Korea, and the Japanese mainland, it will be as easy as turning one's hand. In the future, if the United States and the Soviet Union really cooperate in the Far East, the pressure they can exert on Japan will be far greater than that of Singapore or Manila; therefore, for economic interests, Japan naturally considers the possible gains from advancing south to be great, but if considering national defense security, the need for advancing north is obviously more urgent, but the huge strength of the Far East Red Army is not as easy to deal with as Japan's general northern advance faction imagines. What's more, according to yesterday's Reuters report, England and America are likely to strengthen their defenses in the Western Pacific on the one hand, and warn Japan with practical actions on the other, making it clear that England and America cannot sit idly by while it invades the Soviet Union. It can be seen that even if Japan acts foolishly in this regard, it is difficult to have a chance to succeed.</p>
<p>In short, it is a very obvious fact that Japan, which is now completely isolated economically and diplomatically, has reached the final stage where it must take risky actions; but according to the above, whether it advances south or north, it is not only difficult to imagine "smooth sailing," but it is feared that the road will be full of thorns; however, even if there are many difficulties, Konoe, who has formed the third cabinet, is already in the embarrassing situation of "it is difficult to stay if there are no more achievements," and in fact there must be a day when he has no time to choose and takes risks. Therefore, the democratic front must sharpen its swords and be prepared to deal with all possible developments. The best thing, of course, is to seize the opportunity first. If this is not possible, at least in terms of defensive strategy, it must be placed in a tight and seamless position. The first thing that should be firmly established is full cooperation between China, England, America, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands, and responding to all events with united action. Specifically, if Japan moves against Thailand first, China and England should immediately fight back. At the same time, the Far East Red Army must exert its restraining power in the north, while the United States, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the British dominions should strengthen their blockade against Japan and step up assistance to China and the Soviet Union to help them complete the final blow against Japan. The confirmation and preparation of this joint action should undoubtedly be the top priority of the governments of various democratic countries today.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Aircraft Raided Chongqing Again Yesterday in Separate Batches, Dropped Many Bombs in the Mountains in the Western Suburbs, Did Not Hit Any Military Targets</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News, (1) The Japanese army surrounded by the Chinese army in Yangjiawan, Huangjiachang, Guojiachong, Changjiacen and other places has been largely wiped out after being severely attacked by the Chinese army for days. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to mop up and has now cleared the Japanese army in the Guanzhuangchang area. (2) After defeating the Japanese army that violated Xujiahe and other places north of Yichang, the Chinese army continued to capture Longwangdong Xiaojiagang on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated, and the Chinese army tracked down and chased after them, reaching the west bank of Wuduhu. The Japanese army scrambled to cross the river, but was killed and drowned due to the flash flood. No less than 300 people. In the Caojia area, the Japanese army was also wiped out by the Chinese army a lot. (August 8th telegram)</p>
<p>Enshi (1) After the Chinese army outside Yichang recovered Jujiagou and Shibanwan, they continued to occupy Longwangdong on the 7th. The Japanese army was unable to support and retreated towards Xiaoxita. The Chinese army tracked down and chased after them. When the Japanese army retreated to the Huangbai River in Xiaoxita, it was just when the river was flooded, and the situation was extremely turbulent. The Japanese army wanted to make a final struggle against the water, but after being gradually pressed by the Chinese army to the river bank, the Japanese army was forced to fall into the water and flowed away with the waves. The rest were completely killed by the Chinese army. (2) On the morning of the 7th, more than 400 Japanese troops on the west bank of Yichang took dozens of wooden boats and proceeded to the urban area of Yichang. After being discovered by the Chinese artillery, they aimed at the Japanese boats and bombarded them. In just a few minutes, dozens of Japanese boats were all hit and overturned by the Chinese artillery fire, and no Japanese troops were spared. (3) More than 1,000 Japanese troops who advanced towards Haoqian were broken and defeated by the Chinese army on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese army retreated to Cenhekou and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army obtained a lot of military supplies and is now continuing to pursue them. (July 7 telegram)</p>

Representatives of various branches of the Industrial Cooperative Association gathered in the capital to hold a meeting, chaired by American chief consultant Fei Wusheng. According to the initial stage of the Industrial Cooperative Movement, the scale was small. Now it has grown rapidly, with 45,000 employees, divided into 700 cooperative cell organizations, with an annual production value of more than 20 million yuan. (August 8 Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Chongqing The local news was obtained last night that the Japanese side has identified the establishment of a military agreement between China and Britain. This news was caused by China's deployment of defenses in the Yunnan-Guangxi border area since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam. China recognizes that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a threat to the southwestern provinces of China. Therefore, senior military officials are stationed in Yunnan to monitor the deployment of national defense. It is heard that the central government and the Yunnan provincial authorities have a complete understanding of the defense. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing For nearly eight days, the Japanese planes have not come to bomb due to the bad weather here. Unexpectedly, after the weather improved yesterday, it suffered five raids in 24 hours. More than 100 Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs, the north bank of Jialing, and the south bank of the Yangtze River yesterday afternoon. At night, they carried out a night attack under the bright sunlight. Just after midnight, seven Japanese planes dropped bombs near Ximen. Today, 27 Japanese planes bombed the western suburbs. Two hours later, 18 planes came again to drop bombs there. At noon today, 27 Japanese planes bombed the mountains in the western suburbs. Many bombs fell in the area where the British ambassador's residence is located. It is said that two unfinished air-raid shelters were directly hit yesterday afternoon, causing partial collapse and causing several deaths. Several bombs fell on a certain ferry on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The Japanese planes continued to bomb, but did not hit military targets, but made the residents trapped in the air-raid shelters day and night. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Chongqing was attacked by 220 Japanese bombers five times in 24 hours. The last time was at 3:30 pm today. Chongqing suffered no less than three attacks today. Although the number of Japanese aircraft participating in each attack was large, the damage suffered by the city was small. The area around the Press Club was heavily attacked. This attack Japanese aircraft have obviously used new tactics to avoid intensive anti-aircraft fire. Each time they bombed, the Japanese aircraft were divided into several groups and flew into Chongqing from three or four different directions to drop bombs on the city. This method is obviously intended to confuse the anti-aircraft gunners. These anti-aircraft gunners have gradually become good at using their anti-aircraft guns, and the network of fire they emit is more dense than before. Few residents here sleep because they enter the air-raid shelter at 12:10 in the morning and only three planes fly over the city until 4 o'clock, obviously with the intention of harassing. When the first attack of the day began at 7:30 am, residents had to escape again, so there was not much time to sleep in bed. The last air raid alarm of the day was issued at 3:20 pm.

<h3>Thailand Issues Official Statement Yesterday, Unafraid of War When Necessary, Denies Any Country Has Threatened, and Reiterates No Concern About Aggression</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 9th Dispatch: Today, a statement was issued here saying that if Thai troops are required to fight to implement Thailand's policy of defending neutrality and befriending all parties, they will not be afraid of war and will maintain the traditional prestige of the Thai army and fight to the end. The official document denies that any country has demanded bases from Thailand or threatened it, and stresses that Thailand is not disturbed by the movement of troops outside its borders, and reiterates that it does not consider aggression to be a concern.</p>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 9th Dispatch: It is reported that two-thirds of the Japanese troops have arrived here, and the rest are scheduled to come here within a week. The Japanese side is now planning to establish a permanent landing base in Saigon.</p>
<h3>Japan-Thailand Situation: No Improvement; Eastern Report Claims Britain Pressing Thailand to Sign Defense Agreement</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 9th: Diplomatic sources here believe that the Japan-Thailand situation has not improved much in the past few hours. They say that Eden and Hull's remarks have excited the Thai people, but the atmosphere is still uncertain. If the slight progress currently present in the situation can be maintained, then it may be hoped that the current Thai trend will subside in the same way as the previous trend in the Dutch East Indies. However, the Thai trend is not entirely the same as the Dutch East Indies trend.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Asahi Shimbun received a report yesterday from a correspondent in Bangkok, stating that they learned from reliable political figures that Britain has suggested to Thailand that they sign a defense agreement and establish military bases within Thai territory. Britain also intends to return to Thailand the land that previously belonged to Thailand but has now been incorporated into the territories of Burma and the Malay Peninsula. If the Thai people reject this request, all of Thailand's funds in Britain and the United States, amounting to 200,000,000 Thai baht, will be frozen. The correspondent described the circumstances under which this request was made, stating that on August 2, the British Minister to Thailand, Sir Josiah Crosby, visited Thai Prime Minister General Phibunsongkhram for an hour-long meeting. Subsequently, the British, American, and Dutch consuls stationed in Bangkok, but the Thai acting foreign minister considered the matter. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun also reported yesterday that Chinese businessmen in Bangkok were aware that Britain had suggested that Thailand enter into a commercial agreement to stop transporting rice, rubber, and tin to Japan. If Thailand agrees, it can recover its lost territories. Britain is now trying to prevent the transportation of goods to Thailand, such as tin ore, in order to force Thailand to stop transporting tin to Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan Eager to Overcome Economic Difficulties: Ogura Hosts Banquet for Financiers</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: Finance Minister Ogura invited 28 prominent financiers to a luncheon at his official residence, where he delivered a speech expressing his determination to implement the government's monetary and economic policies and stabilize the nation's currency activities. He stated that under the current delicate and changing international situation, the government will carefully implement the cabinet's decisions on monetary and financial policies and requested the sincere support of the financiers so that the government can effectively implement various economic measures to overcome all difficulties and enable the nation's finances to safely navigate the current critical situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance announced the establishment of a special committee within the Foreign Exchange Control Committee to study and implement concrete measures to cope with the economic pressure imposed by foreign countries. This special committee will include the director of the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the director of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the section chiefs of the Planning Board, led by an official from the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that this new committee will meet next week to discuss measures for navigation, trade, and foreign exchange adjustment activities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Funds Frozen in the United States, Valued at $130 Million</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th: The Department of Commerce estimated yesterday that the total value of Japanese assets frozen by the United States is $130,000,000. The Department of Commerce stated that, according to the freezing order, not only must all assets of the frozen countries within this country obtain a permit before being traded, but also all other financial transactions between the United States and the frozen countries must obtain a permit. The freezing of foreign assets should be regarded as a kind of protection and custody during the current emergency, because freezing control is a special element of national defense. Interest, dividends, rent, and funds are still allowed to be freely transferred from the United States until the various freezes transfer this type of transaction to official control. The Treasury Department stated that the frozen Japanese assets are not much compared to the $2,200,000,000 in European assets that were frozen on July 14.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: Japanese sources say that as a result of the freezing of Japanese assets by Britain and the United States, Japanese rayon export merchants held a meeting in Osaka and passed a resolution to establish an association to adjust the rayon export plan. It is reported that this newly established association will provide financial assistance to export merchants who are forced to postpone their export goods.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: According to a Japanese government spokesperson, since the U.S. government froze Japanese funds, the U.S. authorities have stopped issuing permits for the export of kerosene to Japan, and other commercial issues between the U.S. and Japan have not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Nations Abiding by Public Law Need Not Fear Encirclement: Hull Responds to Tokyo's Remarks, Acknowledges Japan is to Blame</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th: Sources here believe that if the claim by Japanese officials that Britain and the United States believe Japan has aggressive intentions towards Thailand is indeed a mistake, then that would be a great thing, but they fear that Britain and the United States may not be mistaken. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has given a full reply to Japan's opposition to being surrounded. Hull said that countries that abide by the law need not worry about encirclement. This means that if Japan has no aggressive intentions and is peace-loving, as its spokesperson said, then the United States has no reason to worry about it. People here generally find it difficult to believe that the seizure of Manchuria, the invasion of China, and the occupation of Vietnam are the actions of a peace-loving country, and considering the clear evidence of the pressure on Thailand, they are convinced that their suspicions of Japan are well-founded. Thailand has never requested to join the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere promoted by Japan, but Tokyo insists that Thailand must be included in the sphere. This also contradicts Tokyo's recent statement that it does not want to invade Thailand and is difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>Attacking Thailand Is Like a Desperate Gamble</p>
<p>There is a feeling in Washington that everything coming from Tokyo has the same tone of Japanese, but the technique is Nazi. Japan's statement that it does not want to invade Thailand is like Germany's statement before swallowing up many European countries that it would not invade other countries. Many believe that Thailand will be the starting point of the Pacific War, just as Poland was the starting point of the European War. However, as seen from here, Japan does not have the strong position in the Pacific that Germany had in Europe when it launched its aggression. If it dares to invade Thailand, it is like risking the fate of the entire country in a desperate gamble. Japanese leaders should now believe the words of Hull and Eden and know that this great danger exists. If they know it and still want to risk it, then there may be no such people. Therefore, it is believed here that Tokyo at least now realizes that the risk of this move is too great.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th: Secretary of State Hull replied yesterday to reports from Tokyo that Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies were encircling Japan, saying that countries that abide by international law need not fear encirclement. He also said that if any country finds itself surrounded by countries that abide by international law, it is to blame.</p>
<p>Germany Plans to Control Latin America</p>
<p>Regarding Germany's attempt to control Latin America, Hull said that this is a constant excuse made by a country that has already seized fifteen European countries and is thinking of conquering the Americas. Hull said that what the Germans are saying is a transparent propaganda, and no one in the Western Hemisphere believes it. He also said that the State Department is studying how to rescue Americans who are suffering in Japan, Britain, or other regions. Hull refused to comment on the content of his talks with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky and the chief representative of the Soviet mission to Washington, Ivanovitch.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Claims Loyalty to Axis Powers</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Foreign Minister Toyoda said yesterday at a reception for Axis journalists that Germany, Japan, and Italy, linked together by a solemn alliance, will cooperate to overcome the various obstacles on their common path.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 9th: According to news released here, Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda wrote in response to questions from Tokyo reporters of German and Italian official news agencies that no encirclement, whether implemented or being prepared, can cause Japan to turn back from the path it is currently taking. Japan will pay attention to any new plans that threaten Japan's security and the security of East Asia. He added that Japan is now monitoring the situation with great attention because Japan cannot ignore the political and military developments that may occur around it.</p>
<h3>British and American Nationals Evacuate from Vietnam</h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 9th: Yesterday, 55 American nationals left here aboard the French ship "Chaffeurs" for Manila. On Sunday, 15 British nationals will go to Singapore. After that, there will only be 15 British people left here, including the consul-general and his staff.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General Goto Arrives in Sydney</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 9th: The Japanese ship "Kashima Maru" arrived here today from Yokohama, eight days behind schedule. A Dutch destroyer boarded the ship in the sea north of Australia. Japanese Consul-General Goto and Second Secretary Fukushima of the Japanese Embassy arrived on the ship. After learning the latest news, Goto said that if war was about to break out, he would have no need to come here. However, he did not think that war was about to break out, as the fact that the government sent him to Sydney could prove this. The ship also carried 53 Polish people who had escaped from Poland to Japan via the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Under Violent Oppression, the People of Southern Europe are Increasingly Anti-German; Guerrillas Control Mountainous Areas, Engaging in Regular Warfare with German Occupation Forces</h3>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 9th: News of an open rebellion against the German occupation forces in Yugoslavia, reported by Moscow, has been confirmed by responsible sources in Southern Europe here. It is said that the resistance of the Serbian people is becoming increasingly fierce, to the extent that the occupation authorities can only control the larger cities, while all smaller towns and mountainous areas are controlled by guerrillas. There are no fewer than 50,000 guerrillas in the Santzak and Herzegovina regions of Montenegro (also known as the Black Mountain Country). Serbians in northern Bosnia have rebelled and are now fighting fiercely in the Krajina and Kotor regions. Disruptions to railway traffic are increasing daily, and crops everywhere are being destroyed and hidden. An important tunnel near Pirot on the Nish-Sofia railway has been blown up. German retaliation is brutal: 216 people have been killed in Belgrade, the city has been fined 10 million Yugoslav dinars, and strict martial law has been imposed. In the Vojvodina region, 90 Serbians have been executed for destroying crops.</p>
<p>Reuters, French Border, 9th: News from Zagreb says that Serbian guerrillas and German occupation forces are now engaged in regular warfare in Bosnia. The Serbians are now holding steep mountains, using the weapons and ammunition hidden by the retreating Yugoslav regular army. Guerrillas launch attacks on German outposts every night and carry out sabotage operations, even bombing important railway bridges.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Negotiations Reach Tense Stage: Rumors of German Demand for North African Bases; Weygand Returns to Vichy to Meet Pétain</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Vichy, 9th: General Weygand, commander of the French forces in Africa, flew here yesterday and dined with Marshal Pétain. Cabinet Secretary Darlan, who had been in Paris for two days, also returned to Vichy last night. Darlan is believed to have discussed with German representatives in Paris French policy towards Africa. Rumors are spreading that new Franco-German cooperation will begin soon, with France giving Germany French bases in North Africa.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 9th: Sources here said yesterday that Germany may be granted port and transportation facilities in several French colonies. It is claimed that this convenience was the maximum concession from the French side to Germany's recent demands discussed at the Cabinet meeting on Saturday night. At the same time, General Weygand has from Algiers to have an important talk with the cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: The fact that French North African Commander Weygand is now going to Vichy is believed here to mean that Franco-German negotiations on the defense of French territory have now reached a tense stage, and the direct consequence of Vichy's order making General Weygand subordinate to Darlan is almost certainly ordered by the German side, as the Germans do not trust Weygand. Weygand is supported by the French people, is far more popular than Darlan, and holds real power in North Africa. If Weygand goes to Vichy and disagrees with Darlan, it will be as expected, as the French people of North Africa do not want to see their land handed over to Germany and break off relations with the United States.</p>
<h3>General Dentz Placed Under British Detention: Vichy Protests to Britain</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 9th: The French government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Pietri, to protest to the British government about the detention of General Dentz and 35 other French officials.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Reports from Beirut that former High Commissioner to Syria Dentz and several other Vichy officers had been detained were due to the fact that 75 Indian officers captured during the Syrian war had been flown away by Vichy pilots to an unknown destination and had not yet returned. A communiqué issued by the British military headquarters in Beirut stated that about 35 Vichy senior officers in Syria and Lebanon, including General Dentz, were detained by British authorities yesterday afternoon and will be detained in Palestine as collateral pending the implementation of Article 7 of the armistice agreement. According to this article, the Vichy authorities guaranteed the return of all Allied officers captured during the war, but the Vichy authorities have not yet clearly announced the whereabouts of some of the captured officers, and some of these officers have been found in areas occupied by the Axis powers, so the British army has the necessity to detain Vichy senior officers. According to military sources in Beirut, the repatriation of Vichy troops who wish to leave Syria is still proceeding in accordance with the terms of the agreement. It is reported that once all the Allied officers who were taken away from Syria have been found, the 35 Vichy officers can be released. It is believed that some of the captured British troops were taken away from Syria when the armistice agreement was first signed. Several French ships recently arrived in Beirut to continue carrying back Vichy civilians and troops.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 9th: Two senior officials of the German secret police have arrived in Istanbul by special plane and have had close contact with the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. It is claimed that they will soon go to Iran. German activities in Iran have caused anxiety in the Middle East. Turkey's attitude towards Iran is very clear: it wants it to maintain neutrality and be a pillar of peace together with other signatory countries of the Saadabad Pact. In short, Turkey does not want to see any disputes occur in Iran, which might lead to the Soviet Union occupying western Iran. Turkey admits to being somewhat anxious about the situation in Iran, but hopes that the Iranian government will be able to maintain peace and neutrality in the future.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 9th: A telegram from Iran received here says that reports from abroad that Iran has already mobilized are inaccurate. The Iranian embassy here also said that it did not know that Iran had already mobilized, but partial mobilization is underway in preparation for defense. Reports that Iranian troops are concentrated along Kermanshah and Lake Urmia have also been confirmed by travelers arriving here from the area, but reports of large-scale concentration have not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 9th: The Italian official news agency reports from Berlin that responsible sources in Berlin firmly deny rumors that the German government threatened Iran that if it expelled German nationals from its territory, it would sever diplomatic relations with Iran.</p>

<h3>Retaliation Bombing of Moscow: Soviet Aircraft Attack Berlin Twice</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: Soviet aircraft attacked Berlin on Thursday night, the first time since the start of the Soviet-German war, and the mystery of the mysterious bombing of Berlin on Sunday night has been solved. According to a Moscow radio broadcast last night, Soviet aircraft initially decided to attack Berlin on Thursday night, dropping several incendiary and high-explosive bombs on military targets. Explosions and fires were seen, and Soviet aircraft carried out extensive reconnaissance flights in German airspace before returning safely to their original defenses without losing a single aircraft. The German radio station said that Berlin had recently been attacked, with slight damage to buildings and some civilian casualties.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 9th: According to the "Exchange Telegraph" news from Moscow, the Soviet Air Force attacked military targets in various districts of Berlin on Thursday night. Explosions and large fires were said to have been continuous, and all Soviet aircraft returned safely. The Soviet embassy here said that if reports of the Soviet air raid on Berlin are confirmed, it would be the first time that Soviet aircraft have bombed the German mainland, and also a retaliatory blow against Germany for the initial German air raid on Moscow. The air force here reported that the aircraft that decided to attack Berlin were definitely not from the Royal Air Force, because the Royal Air Force "did not attack Berlin on Sunday night."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: According to news from Moscow, Soviet aircraft continued to fly to and bomb the German capital last night after the air raid on Berlin on Thursday night. The German side also admitted that its capital had been attacked for two consecutive nights. Last night, the German radio stations in Warsaw, Kalisz, and Latvia all stopped broadcasting due to air raids.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 9th: Correspondents for Swedish newspapers in Berlin reported that when Soviet aircraft first raided Berlin on Thursday night, residents were caught off guard because they did not know that enemy aircraft were overhead until the bombs exploded.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: A responsible source in Berlin declared that German aircraft had a successful air raid on Moscow on the night of the 6th, with heavy damage to the Soviet capital's aircraft factory. Only one German aircraft did not return to its original defenses. In recent days, German aircraft bombing Moscow have caused ten fires in aircraft factories, and many places in the eastern and southern districts of Moscow have also been hit.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 9th: Officials revealed yesterday that German aircraft had bombed the Academy of Sciences here on a recent night. The academy is one of Moscow's famous scenic spots. The academy's library was burned down by incendiary bombs, and the building contained 3 million volumes of books.</p>
<h3>Southern Ukrainian Region Becomes Focus of Soviet-German War: Germany Claims to Have Occupied Korosten, Threatening the Black Sea Port of Odessa</h3>
<p>Reuters, London Military, 9th: Fierce fighting continued throughout the day yesterday on the entire Soviet front, with the main focus still on Ukraine. The battle for the two key cities of Kyiv and Odessa in the region is raging. According to the latest news, the main force of the German army is advancing, but has shifted from Kyiv to the southeast, possibly to invade the Black Sea port of Odessa.</p>
<p>A Soviet communiqué released late last night stated that there had been fighting in the areas of Keksholm, Smolensk, Korosten, and Belaya Tserkov, as well as on the Estonian front. It also stated that the Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the army, inflicted blows on German mechanized units, infantry, and German aircraft. On Sunday, the Soviet side destroyed 21 German aircraft, and the Soviet aircraft lost ten. On the afternoon of the 8th, Soviet fighter planes shot down a German reconnaissance plane near Moscow, and the crew was arrested.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th: German infantry occupied the railway center of Korosten yesterday. The city is 75 kilometers northeast of Kyiv. The German army occupied the city after severely damaging the remnants of the Soviet 5th Army and reinforcements in the forest and swamp area. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet army has used the city as a supply center.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 9th: The German army's advance into the fertile agricultural and industrial areas of Soviet Ukraine seemed to be quite successful yesterday. The British believe that Odessa is already under threat. The German High Command claimed to have occupied Uman, a major railway center 155 miles north of Odessa. Odessa is 80 miles south of Belaya Tserkov and 120 miles south of Kyiv. British sources said that the German army is advancing south along the right bank of the Dnieper River towards Odessa and Nikolaev, which is 70 miles northeast. It is believed that the plains there are conducive to offensive operations, and it is suspected that when the Nazis reach the coast, the Soviet army may not be able to establish a strong new position to defend the Black Sea coast. The "London Times" warned of the danger of the German army considering the oil use of Ukrainians, Caucasians, Indians, and the Middle East. Moscow said that there was nothing about the news about Ukraine.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th: According to responsible sources in London, the German threat to Odessa is becoming more and more serious. Judging from the current situation, the German army is progressing faster and faster from Belaya Tserkov towards the southeast, and is advancing west along the southern side of the Dnieper River, having already passed Kyiv. The German army is attempting to cross the river but is facing resistance. The main force will bypass the river towards the Black Sea in an attempt to encircle Odessa and the city of Nikolaev in the interior. If successful, it will cut off Odessa and other places from the north. However, if the German army encounters unexpected resistance, it may change its direction of attack. It is reported that a railway line between Kyiv and Odessa has been cut off, but traffic on other railway lines between the two places has not been affected. There were few changes in the war situation in other areas of the Soviet front yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rainy and Freezing Seasons Approaching in Soviet Territory, War Prospects Favorable to Soviets</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th: Sources arriving here today claimed that the fierce resistance of the Soviet army to the German army's effectiveness, as well as the approaching rainy season in Soviet territory, have led most military experts in the United States to believe that the German army is unlikely to achieve success on the eastern front this year. Therefore, the final victory of the Allied countries is more hopeful. These people pointed out that the German army has not yet gained any strategically important strongholds, and the climate in the next six weeks may be favorable to the Soviet army, and they believe that German mechanized teams will be trapped in the mud. It is also said that there are often heavy rains in Soviet territory in mid-September, and there is heavy snow at any time, and water freezes in November. Military experts pay special attention to the freezing climate because the Soviet Union has special experience in aviation during the freezing period.</p>
<h3>German War Report Extravagantly Claims Victory, 25th Red Army Division Annihilated</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Headquarters of the Führer, 9th: The German Supreme Command announced last night that, after the German army's new offensive was announced in the special military report, initial battle results have now been obtained in Ukraine. According to a report by Army Group Commander Marshal von Rundstedt, as a result of the cooperation between the army group and Air Force Commander General Löhr, the Soviet 6th and 12th Armies and part of the 18th Army, a total of 25 infantry, mountain, armored, and motorized divisions, have been annihilated. A total of 103,000 prisoners have been captured, and the commanders of the 6th and 12th Armies have also been captured. In addition, there are 317 armored vehicles, 858 cannons, 5,250 trucks, several trains loaded with ammunition, and countless other war trophies. The enemy's losses are extremely heavy, and the number that has already been confirmed exceeds 200,000.</p>
<h3>Strong Soviet Reserves; Active Guerrilla Warfare in German-Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th -- Although the German side announced that the Battle of Smolensk had been won and concluded, a Berlin correspondent for a Swiss newspaper reported that the continued advance of German forces toward Moscow depends on the number of reserves the Red Army can deploy to the battlefield. The Soviet Union's successful transfer of reserves from its Asian territories is evident. It is widely known that the Soviet Union has a very large army in the countryside. Although the German side is now making predictions that the Soviet army will soon be defeated, it is understood that even if the Soviet army is defeated, it does not mean the end of the Soviet-German war. It is predicted that the Soviet army will launch large-scale guerrilla warfare and conduct local, long-term resistance. The strength of the Soviet army's resistance has been quite unexpected. Their staff officers appear to be quite capable, and the Soviet army's tenacity and adequate equipment are surprisingly impressive.</p>
<p>General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in the central region (including Smolensk), recently called on the people in the Soviet territory temporarily occupied by the German army to join guerrilla units to intercept and destroy German transport units in the rear, destroy bridges, cut telegraph and telephone lines, burn houses and forests that could be used by German soldiers for shelter, and not provide the enemy with any food.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th -- According to reliable sources here, guerrilla warfare in Poland is increasing daily. German military transport continues to be disrupted by Polish guerrillas, and several ammunition trains heading to the Eastern Front have been blown up by landmines en route. It is also reported that German soldiers are going missing every day in the dense Polish forests.</p>
<h3>Romanian Army Suffers 100,000 Casualties Aiding German Operations, Public Resentment Boils</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 9th -- According to reliable sources, Romania has lost 100,000 soldiers on the Eastern Front and has experienced great difficulties in supplying provisions and ammunition. Romanian dictator Prime Minister Antonescu has requested German reinforcements. The heavy losses of the Romanian army have caused widespread demoralization. Anti-Antonescu disturbances have occurred in the Romanian capital, Galați, Brăila, and Constanța. Some people are greatly concerned about the safety of King Michael of Romania, who is effectively being held captive by Antonescu.</p>
<h3>Scenes of Hong Kong as Described by an American Correspondent in China (1)</h3>
<p>Mr. M. Gelhorn, a correspondent for the American Coal Shipping Weekly, recently traveled through Hong Kong and drafted an article on his impressions of Hong Kong, published in Collier's magazine. It describes the general living conditions in Hong Kong and a glimpse of local defense, which can provide a glimpse of the overall preparations currently underway in Hong Kong. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Mountains Reflecting the Azure Sea</p>
<p>Rising from the calm, blue-gray sea are countless verdant peaks; this is the appearance of Hong Kong. Hong Kong is surrounded by many small islands, arranged like uninhabitable dots in the ocean. Across a bay from Hong Kong are Kowloon City and the New Territories. The New Territories are a wedge-shaped, mountainous land, the main route from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Every winter, the green mountains of Hong Kong and the yellow hills of the New Territories are shrouded in fog, rain, and low gray clouds. But in spring, the breeze is gentle and pleasant, similar to Florida, California, or southern France in the United States.</p>
<p>In front of the harbor, junks gather, the countless masts forming a dividing line. Beyond this line, the green ferries connecting Hong Kong and Kowloon whistle and their paddlewheels churn ceaselessly. Cargo ships are docked on the Kowloon side, while mail ships are moored far out in the ocean. A gray British cruiser heads out to sea, preceded by many sampans. Lighters, yachts, naval boats, local water patrol boats, and so on crisscross the sea. The harbor's activity, congestion, and noise are just like the streets of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>To a first-time visitor, Hong Kong appears as: New Year's Eve in Times Square, the authentic scene of a five o'clock bullfight, a fire alarm sounding three times, a public auction, and a rural market playing the organ. The streets run parallel to the coast, with three streets on flat ground; behind them are mountain roads that climb upwards. Stone steps are lined with houses and shops. The mountainside is covered in lush greenery, and further up, protruding from the peaks, are countless mansions of the wealthy. The wealthy residents of the mountains can see all the beautiful scenery in the harbor and the densely packed city streets, but they cannot hear or smell anything.</p>
<p>The population of Hong Kong is eight hundred thousand, most of whom are crowded into rooms with eight or ten people. The city is simply filled with the breath of its residents, as well as the smoke from Chinese cooking, the aroma of kueh (a type of snack), the garbage in the ditches, and the smell of sewage from houses without sewers. Occasionally, a gentle breeze blows from the verdant land, and the market feels warm and fragrant, along with the scent of dried seaweed. But you must understand what kind of state Hong Kong is in.</p>
<p>Beneath the various orange, red, and yellow shop signs, pictures and slogans are posted on the pillars of the shops. Chinese coolies walk slowly, and the sound of wooden clogs on the cement pavement is heard everywhere. Suddenly, amidst the various noises, a string of firecrackers sounds like machine-gun fire. The sound of the firecrackers can make you unable to hear any warning sound for ten minutes, and there is also a strong smell of gunpowder. Someone is always celebrating a birthday or getting married; firecrackers are said to bring good luck. Once the firecrackers have finished exploding, Hong Kong is finally quiet for a while.</p>
<p>From the carved beams and painted pillars on the mountain peaks to the dirty alleys near the harbor below, Hong Kong is like a continuous circus. There are special boxes for the gentry, and the side shows in the circus are very elaborate. Happy Valley Racecourse is a circle of green, surrounded by mountains. The racecourse is located between mountain peaks and slums, with these two worlds separated by this mere fence. On race days, an average of HK$500,000 in lottery tickets is sold. This year, the first prize was HK$397,600, which was won by four poor Chinese women. On one side of the field, the flags selling lottery tickets are like the calls of rebels. On a large cloth banner, the names of the horses and the winning numbers are written in Chinese, and layers of Chinese people stand by the fence to watch, paying a few cents each.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence is the club, with private viewing platforms on the roof. Each platform has a dining room attached. Wealthy Chinese and Westerners, women wearing high-collared, long, tight cheongsams, pour out of the platforms to buy horse tickets at the lottery stalls. Amateur jockeys include Portuguese, Chinese, Russians, and British, wearing dazzling clothes and riding small horses around the field. At lunchtime, poor women squeeze out of the racetrack and leave Happy Valley barefoot. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Raid Military Targets in Northwest Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th -- Last night, British bombers flew over northwestern Germany again, heavily bombing military and industrial targets. The Kiel naval port was heavily bombed. According to this morning's Air Ministry communique, British aircraft heavily bombed the Kiel naval base last night under bright moonlight, hitting docks and shipyards, causing five major fires. Hamburg and other places were also attacked by British aircraft. Four British aircraft are missing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 9th -- The Ministry of Interior issued a communique stating that 13 people were killed and 23 injured in the bombing of Alexandria on Thursday night. Houses were slightly damaged.</p>
<h3>Tsarist-Era Officer Re-emerges, Commands All Soviet Forces</h3>
<p>United Press, Rome, 9th -- The Italian official Stefani News Agency claimed that Shaposhnikov, a former officer of the Tsarist era, has assumed command of all Soviet forces.</p>
<h3>German Army Casualties on the Eastern Front Total 500,000, Germany Admits</h3>
<p>Reuters, French Border, 9th -- According to German sources, the German army has suffered a total of 500,000 casualties on the Eastern Front. The total number of wounded and captured has not been announced.</p>
<h3>US Considering Eliminating the North European War Zone, Shipping War Materials to the USSR Via the Atlantic</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th -- Reliable authorities here said yesterday that the elimination of the northernmost four Scandinavian war zones is currently under official discussion in order to allow the United States to quickly transport war materials to the Soviet Union. The first indication of this move was Interior Secretary Ickes' announcement that four oil tankers would be transporting oil to the Soviet Union. He recalled that these territorial waters were included in the war zone because of the Soviet invasion of Finland, which was then considered a blow to the Soviet Union, but the current situation has clearly changed. Another reason for using the Atlantic route is to avoid passing through Japan's territory via Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Polish Military Delegation Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 9th -- A Polish military delegation led by the famous Polish General Szczygiel has arrived here.</p>
<h3>Britain Restores Original Summer Time, Clocks Turn Back One Hour</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th -- British clocks will be turned back one hour at 1:00 AM tomorrow, restoring the original summer time. The double summer time, which has been in effect since May 4, will be abolished.</p>

<h3>Approaching Fourth Anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai, Both Concessions Prepare Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unnecessary Roads are Blocked with Wire Mesh</p>
<p>Communities Prepare for Solemn Commemoration</p>
<p>The fourth anniversary of "August 13th" is fast approaching. The concession authorities began special preparations yesterday, blocking unnecessary roads, prohibiting gatherings and parades, and strictly enforcing the curfew. Various sectors of the community are preparing for a solemn commemoration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Sectors Prepare for Solemn Commemoration</p>
<p>The Shanghai community, given the upcoming fourth anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai and the special environment of Shanghai, decided to comply with the wishes of the concession authorities and not hold extravagant commemorative ceremonies. However, in order to express the citizens' belief in resisting aggression and to mourn the fallen soldiers and compatriots, it was decided that everyone would observe a vegetarian diet for one day and suspend entertainment and banquets. At noon, everyone would stand in silence to mourn, as a solemn commemoration.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Begin Preparations</p>
<p>The police authorities of both concessions, with the anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai approaching, began special preparations to ensure the security of the concessions. The Public Concession, starting yesterday morning, placed barbed wire on unnecessary roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, such as Jiangxi Road, Guangxi Road, Daitou Bridge, Yunnan Road, Longmen Road, Chongqing Road, Lulai Road, and Muller Road, cutting off traffic. Other areas, such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao East New Bridge, Great World, Chengdu Road, Tongfu Road, and Seymour Road, were also fenced off, with entrances and exits guarded by detectives to check suspicious pedestrians. Each bridge over the Suzhou Creek was also guarded by eight officers to conduct inspections. Furthermore, all gatherings, parades, and demonstrations were prohibited, and the curfew was tightened. Although the French authorities have not yet blocked roads, their other measures are the same as those of the Public Concession. These measures will be extended until the 14th. On the anniversary, the bridge and road closures will be tightened as needed to ensure the security of the concessions.</p>
<h3>Yesterday the Wind and Rain Ceased, the City Restored to Normal</h3>
<p>Hurricane Passed Over Shanghai and Attacked North China, Land and Water Transportation Have Been Restored</p>
<p>The Pacific hurricane, which swept across northern Shanghai at 9:00 PM the night before with winds of force seven to nine, still had lingering effects yesterday, and the autumn rain was intermittent, with the sky sometimes dark and sometimes bright. By evening, the weather gradually cleared. However, because yesterday was still the autumn flood tide, although the accumulated water from the night before gradually receded, the low-lying areas were still flooded. However, the situation was much better than the day before, so public transportation gradually resumed, and the cross signal hoisted by the customs was lowered. Shipping, which had been interrupted for a day, resumed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hurricane Heads North, Directly Towards the Yellow Sea</p>
<p>According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, after the hurricane swept over Shanghai, its direction of travel was north-northwest, and its position was between 122 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude, with a wind force of five to six. It still had the potential to cross the East China Sea and enter the Yellow Sea. The coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and northern China will be affected, but because the wind force and speed are decreasing daily, the damage will not be too severe. It is understood that many small wave boats and sampans were sunk off the mouth of Wusong the night before due to the direct impact of the hurricane's center, but all ships in the Huangpu River had been warned by the customs and had taken refuge in safe places, fortunately avoiding a major tragedy.</p>
<p>Inbound and Outbound Shipping Gradually Resumes</p>
<p>Few ships entered the Huangpu River, and there were no outbound ships. At noon, the customs lifted the alert, and the signal ball was lowered. Traffic on the Huangpu River gradually resumed. The first ship to enter the port yesterday was the Huatong small ferry, which runs to northern Jiangsu, arriving at 9:40 AM. This was followed by the Japanese ship Mutou Maru, which runs on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, entering the port at 10:55 AM, returning to Shanghai from Ningbo. At 12:10 PM, the Kompei wheel arrived at the port. At 3:20 PM (the above times are according to the customs clock), the Taikoo Company's Anshun wheel arrived in Shanghai from southern China and docked at the Pudong Wharf. Among the departures yesterday afternoon, the Hanyang wheel sailed to Hong Kong, the Dingsheng wheel went to Yantai-Tianjin, the French wheel Laoyasi sailed to Haiphong, and the Huatong small ferry also departed for northern Jiangsu. Only eight ships entered and left the port all day yesterday. Taikoo Company's New Beijing wheel, presumably sheltering from the wind en route, has not yet been seen and is expected to arrive today. According to shipping industry sources, this hurricane did not have a major impact on the city because it did not directly hit it.</p>
<h3>British and American Interests in Shanghai are Determined to be Upheld</h3>
<p>Even if the Situation is Severe, They are Determined Not to Give Up</p>
<p>As Japan aggressively launches an invasion of Thailand, the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense. The Far East's powder keg is on the verge of exploding. Shanghai, as the largest commercial port in the Far East, is naturally more affected than other places. Yesterday, British and American expatriates in Shanghai began to evacuate, and Pacific shipping is about to be cut off, causing extreme panic among the general public. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency, in order to find out the truth, visited relevant figures in the port yesterday and received the following opinions: A leader of the American business community said that the deterioration of the situation in the Far East has reached its peak today. The United States is determined not to allow the threats of aggressor countries to force us to abandon our legitimate interests in the Far East. Shanghai has lost its political status and is only a commercial center. If the Pacific war unfortunately breaks out, we will still maintain our business in Shanghai and will not retreat. There are not many American expatriates in Vietnam and Xichang, and the scope of business is very narrow, so it is appropriate for American expatriates to evacuate as soon as possible. The situation in Shanghai is different and cannot be generalized. The so-called evacuation order is only a suggestion to encourage voluntary action. Those who have important commercial and other duties are not included. The rumor that the United States has begun to accelerate the evacuation of American expatriates in Shanghai is unreliable.</p>
<p>Long Prepared, Not Intimidated by Threats</p>
<p>An important British expatriate said that the Pacific war would be an integral part of the European war and could not be separated. We are prepared and will not allow our rights and interests to be harmed. As for the Sino-British alliance, it is the result of ulterior motives and is exaggerated. In any case, the necessary precautions in the Far East have now been completed. We are prepared to accept anyone's provocation. There are still over ten thousand British expatriates in Shanghai, including Indians and British-Chinese. However, there has been no special evacuation recently.</p>
<h3>Dali and Daxin Wheels to Trial Shanghai-Aotou Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wenzhou route was interrupted due to the Jianghai Customs stopping clearance for a long time. According to shipping industry sources, recently, the merchant Dali wheel, intending to load cargo from Shanghai to Guleitou, returned to Shanghai a few days ago. The British merchant Daxin wheel also set sail from Shanghai on the 7th of this month, but there has been no telegram up to yesterday. Because the two wheels are trial voyages, they did not carry passengers. However, it is understood that the Jianghai Customs has not yet formally permitted customs clearance for the shipping wheels there.</p>
<h3>Swiss and Dutch Consulates Retreat Far Eastern Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Limited to those who reside on a "non-essential" basis</p>
<p>Shanghai Japanese and Swiss Overseas Chinese Retreat at the Same Time</p>
<p>The Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontanna, told reporters yesterday that the Swiss authorities are currently carrying out the evacuation of "non-essential" Swiss nationals residing in China and Japan, but this plan should not be regarded as a complete retreat of Swiss nationals in the Far East. Mr. Fang also said that he had received instructions from the Swiss Legation in Japan, instructing him to find out whether there were any "non-essential" overseas Chinese in this place. The Swiss Legation in Tokyo has compiled a list of Swiss overseas Chinese who will retreat from Japan, and wants to know the names of "non-essential" overseas Chinese in Shanghai in order to retreat together. He has notified the Swiss overseas Chinese here of the steps taken by the Swiss Legation, but he believes that only a few Swiss overseas Chinese in Shanghai will retreat. As for other details, it is not yet known, and it is not known from where the Swiss overseas Chinese will gather to return home. According to the number of Swiss overseas Chinese in Japan, there are one thousand people, and there are 450 people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Dutch Consulate Issues Notice of Retreat</p>
<p>It is also understood that the Dutch Consulate in this port has received government instructions, formally issued a notice, urging its overseas Chinese to register with the office in order to handle the retreat matters. All non-essential Dutch overseas Chinese in the occupied areas of China are allowed to be women and children, and they are urged to retreat and return to the Dutch Indies. There are more than 300 overseas Chinese under the jurisdiction of the Dutch Consulate in this port, and 150 under the jurisdiction of Tianjin Dutch Indies, of which 120 are clergy. In addition, there are about 400 Chinese who have entered the Dutch Indies, and they are also ordered to report to the consulate in order to retreat in time.</p>
<h3>Local Business and Industry Sympathize with Scholarships</h3>
<p>Dingxin Factory Donates 5,000 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Anonymous Person Personally Comes to Our Museum for Assistance</p>
<p>The scholarship of our newspaper readers yesterday accepted donations from all walks of life, reaching more than 7,000 yuan. This number has exceeded the highest peak of 6,000 yuan on the tenth day of this month, which shows that readers are promoting the scholarship more and more enthusiastically. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Creative Initiative of Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Lu Shoulun, a giant in the advertising industry, for the third time raised funds through the Universal Pharmaceutical Factory and transferred them to the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which generously donated 5,000 yuan. The factory's letter said, "The launch of your newspaper's scholarship has received responses from far and wide. From then on, the talented students will never stop singing and reading. We are in awe of this great move and express our gratitude. Our factory will do its best to contribute, and we will not lag behind others. We are sending a check for 5,000 yuan with this letter, and we hope that you will accept it." Dingxin Factory is large in scale, completely scientifically managed, and the Ba Wang brand blue cloth is strong, durable, and never fades. Dingxin nylon and various colored poplin fabrics have large sales, saving many rights and interests every year.</p>
<p>The Anonymous Old Man is Kind and Enthusiastic</p>
<p>An anonymous person, under the pseudonym of A Pitiful Person in This World, previously sent a letter, willing to help our newspaper sponsor the tuition and miscellaneous fees for 50 students of all levels, elementary and middle schools, every semester. When asked how much it would cost, our newspaper estimated that it would cost 2,000 yuan, which was publicly replied on the 6th. After receiving the letter, the anonymous person sent another letter deciding to personally sell the money yesterday, and to talk face to face. Until 10:30 AM yesterday, the anonymous person came to the museum on time and was received by a representative of our newspaper. Because he changed his name, it was inconvenient to ask his name. According to his own statement, he is 56 years old this year, runs a bookstore, and his family is not wealthy. His son works in a foreign company and has been able to support himself. He himself is an optimist and is very sympathetic to our newspaper's scholarship, so he is happy to help. This gentleman is good at Taijiquan, and Zhu Changwen has been asking for it for 30 years. He was amiable when talking. The anonymous person also issued the following written opinions: I am nearly sixty years old, and the scenery is entering the sunset. I am doing small business, and my ability is weak. Because I admire the enthusiasm of the gentlemen who run the Shanghai News Reader Scholarship, I am following their example and doing my best to contribute a little. I hope that the students will follow the purpose of drawing porridge and chiseling walls, read diligently in Yun Chuang, and strive to make progress, so as not to live up to the painstaking efforts of the gentlemen who initiated the Shanghai News Scholarship. If I am still alive next semester, and the business does not change suddenly, I will continue to help. However, the way of heaven is changeable, and human affairs are uncertain, and everything is difficult to predict."</p>
<p>Tuition Fees are Sincere</p>
<p>Han Dazhao, who applied for secondary school a few days ago, stated that he had borrowed tuition fees from relatives and friends, and stated that he would no longer request assistance, so that it could be reserved for other poor and helpless students. Mr. Han's sincerity is commendable, so the original letter is appended, "Dear sir, I went to your museum a few days ago to apply for a scholarship, because the tuition fees of Huatong Public School are too high, and I could not raise them for a while, so I also followed the crowd and asked your museum for assistance, but now I have borrowed it from relatives and friends, so there is no need to spend your museum's subsidy again, so that there will be more assistance for those who have no way to do it. Please check out and send down all the attached documents, or send a letter to inform us, so that we can come to the front and receive it. I am very grateful for your hard work." Applicant Yu Huai also applied to cancel the registration because he already had tuition fees.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donations Were Especially High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the donors were: Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 5,000 yuan; a pitiful person in this world (that is, an anonymous person), 2,000 yuan; a pitiful person in this world also raised 40 yuan for Song Yude, the historian; 100 yuan for Zhen Hezi; 40 yuan for Zhi Ji; 30 yuan for Mr. Shen; 10 yuan for Mr. Jiang Yuntian; 10 yuan for Mr. Lu; and 10 yuan for four weak young people who decided to save money; and 1 yuan for Zhai Xiangqian, a younger brother. The above totaled 7,241 yuan. The previous deposit was 32,593 yuan, 39 cents. The total is 39,834 yuan, 39 cents.</p>
<h3>Unified Type A Bonds to Draw the Capital</h3>
<p>A total of 5.4 million yuan will be refunded. The payment method will be announced by the Ministry at the time.</p>

<h3>Field Visit Records of Scholarship Applicants (4)</h3>
<p>Orphans without fathers and widows without husbands are the most helpless people in the world. Among the students applying for the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship this time, many are orphans without fathers, and many are relying on their mothers to struggle to raise and educate them. For these children, how should we express our warm sympathy to help them succeed in their studies!</p>
<p>Virtuous Mothers</p>
<p>Amidst the magnificent buildings on Yuyuan Road, there is a commoner's alley, which is unexpected. In the living room of the first house, I met the aunt of this little sister. The living room is also the bedroom, and the furnishings are simple. Her mother had gone to teach at the summer school. Her aunt, also a primary school teacher, told me that the child's father was doing business in Tianjin before the war, but there has been no news of him since the incident, and it seems that he is no longer alive! She braved the flames of war in the Zhejiang war zone and brought them, the mother and her two daughters, out. There is also a younger sister who graduated from primary school this year and has been admitted to middle school. Their mother came to Shanghai and worked hard to teach in primary school, raising and educating them. But how can a humble primary school teacher afford the tuition fees for two middle school girls? If the Shenbao Scholarship application fails, then they will have to drop the younger sister out of school! But her mother's heart to nurture her children is very sincere, and the pair of clever and bright sisters are also eager to continue their studies!</p>
<p>Orphans and Widows</p>
<p>At a house on Hart Road, I also met a girl with the same fate. Her father passed away when she was five years old! Now she is going to be in the second year of junior high school. In these seven years, her mother has been teaching in primary school, raising her with great difficulty. Orphans and widows are truly worthy of our sympathy! Fortunately, the mother and daughter are Christians, and they believe that there is hope in hardship. Her mother told me that her teaching position for the next semester has not been decided yet! The child's math skills are poor, but she has a talent for music and plays the piano very well!</p>
<p>This Child Really Wants to Study</p>
<p>The sixteen-year-old boy is particularly tall, showing that he is in good physical condition. His father was a worker in a printing house and passed away four years ago. The mother and son rely on his uncle's support and the help of relatives. This year he is only a second-year junior high school student. With the rising cost of living, his uncle can no longer afford his tuition. But he told me that his education is not enough yet! Neighbors told me that their mother and son's life is really hard, but this child really wants to study. An elderly woman of about fifty, the child's mother, said, "We will repay the help that people give us in the future."</p>
<p>Leaving Behind Three Advertising Billboards</p>
<p>The sixteen-year-old child is male and is already in the second year of high school, indicating that he is quite intelligent. He has a handsome appearance, answers fluently, and is courteous. He lives in a pavilion room in a house on Carter Road. A mother and two sisters. His father passed away four years ago! It happened to be the year the war broke out! His father used to run a roadside advertising business. Now, what remains are three roadside billboards, and the four of them rely on this to make a living. After graduating from junior high school, he was recommended to Nanyang Middle School. He only paid half of the tuition for the last semester. He told me that Nanyang does not have any free places, but by the end of the semester, he had not paid the full amount, and the principal simply removed him from the school roll. Now, with the announcement of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship, he hopes to be able to help him complete his studies. (S)</p>

<h3>Mobil's Large Amount of Gasoline Seized, Has Negotiated with Customs</h3>
<p>Mobil Believes that the Transportation of Oil Does Not Involve Politics, Only Technical Violations of Customs Regulations</p>
<p>Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao," carrying oil to ports on the Yangtze River, was detained by the Japanese for several days. Although the ship has now been released, the 1,600 barrels of oil it was carrying (five gallons per barrel) have been confiscated by the Japanese on some pretext. Regarding this matter, according to a Mobil Company representative yesterday, the company is currently in direct consultation with the Jianghai Customs authorities in order to recover the batch of oil. The representative firmly denied the statement by the Japanese Navy spokesman here that the "Meiyao" was transporting oil to supply the Chinese guerrillas. It is said that the detention of the "Meiyao" was not a political incident, but a customs incident. The ship is believed to have technically violated the Jianghai Customs Regulations, so they are seeking a solution in this regard. The "Meiyao" has now been returned to Mobil Oil Company by customs.</p>
<p>Alleging Supply to Chinese Guerrillas</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 8th), it was disclosed at a reception for journalists held by the Japanese that the Japanese had returned the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao" to the company. However, the 2,000 barrels of oil carried by the ship were confiscated. It was because the Japanese Navy found out that when the "Meiyao" was detained, it was chartered by a Chinese merchant firm to transport oil to supply the Chinese guerrillas who are still holding the north bank of the Yangtze River. The Xinhang port, where the "Meiyao" attempted to unload oil, is a port held by the guerrillas. It is reported that the "Meiyao" was detained by the Japanese on August 4th and then handed over to the Jianghai Customs, which in turn handed it over to Mobil Company. It is now berthed at the Mobil Wharf.</p>

Afterwards, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched multiple hose carts to the scene for rescue. Due to the intensity of the fire, it was not easy to extinguish.

<p>Suspected of Serious Misconduct, Leading to Detention and Interrogation</p>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reported that the Public Concession Police, at the request of the U.S. authorities, arrested Mr. Teedale Pons, Deputy Executive Officer of the U.S. Narcotics Bureau in China, this morning (the 8th) and detained him in the Ward Road Western Prison for questioning. It is believed that Mr. Teedale was arrested because he failed to report to the U.S. authorities about the loss of several guns from the U.S. Narcotics Bureau.</p>
<p>Guns Lost from U.S. Bureau</p>
<p>The incident arose because the Municipal Council Police recently received several guns sent from the area outside the Shanghai West Concession, requesting registration in the Public Concession. The Police Department conducted an inspection and found that these guns belonged to the U.S. Narcotics Bureau. The U.S. authorities opened an inquiry, and because Mr. Teedale, as Deputy Executive Officer, had failed to report the loss of the guns, they requested the Police Department to arrest Mr. Teedale. It is known that Mr. Teedale had previously worked as a reporter at a radio station in Shanghai for a short period of time. A few months ago, he joined the U.S. Narcotics Bureau as Deputy Executive Officer, replacing Mr. Lee, the U.S. Narcotics Bureau's Executive Officer, who had returned to the United States for a short trip.</p>

However, the U.S. authorities and the Police Department remained tight-lipped. The details of Mr. Teedale's arrest are unknown. It is only known that he was arrested by Detective Creighton of the Western District and two other police officers and transferred to the Ward Road Western Prison. The U.S. Narcotics Bureau side was that Prosecutor Hills invited police officers from the Police Department to his Narcotics Bureau office to arrest Mr. Teedale.</p>

<h3>Dr. Bai's Yellow and Black Medicine Sold for 20,000 Lira</h3>
<p>The Catholic Action Association has yellow and black potions, which have miraculous effects in treating various internal and external ailments. They were created by the Italian Benedictine priest Dr. Bai (Prof. Benussi Bossi). Dr. Bai came to China in 1887 and practiced medicine in Suzhou, using these medicines to treat people, often with miraculous results. Lu Bohong and Zhu Zhiyao and other gentlemen raised 20,000 Italian lira to obtain his formula to make medicine to help the world, and it was kept by Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhuang Zhenjia, and Nuo Meibei.

<h3>New Contribution to the Medical Field: Yu Fa's Anti-Tuberculosis Drug</h3>
<p>Yu , director of the Biological Research Institute of the Xin Ya Factory in Shanghai, is a medical doctor from Harvard University in the United States. He was the Chief Technician and Acting Director of the Central Epidemic Prevention Department and the Director of the Bacteriology Department of the Lester Institute for Medical Research. He is a true expert in bacteriology. Recently, based on his research and crystallization, he invented a special drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, called "Anti-Tuberculosis Element," which has been applied in the Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society and other major hospitals, with remarkable effectiveness. It is really a great contribution to the medical field.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu said: "Among children in Shanghai under the age of fourteen, 61% have tuberculosis. Among adults, 100,000 people die each year from tuberculosis, and about 500 people die from tuberculosis each year. This number is the standard of the world, which is really shocking."</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about the types of tuberculosis, Dr. Yu said that there are as many as eight or nine types, such as intestinal tuberculosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, kidney tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, scrofula cervical tuberculosis, eye and skin tuberculosis. Ordinary patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are the majority, but there are not many patients with laryngeal tuberculosis. Anyone suffering from tuberculosis must have tubercle bacilli in their body. This bacterium can be transmitted to others and invade the lungs, causing pulmonary tuberculosis; invade the bones, causing bone tuberculosis; invade the intestinal tract, skin, kidneys, and lymph nodes, all of which can cause tuberculosis. The tubercle bacilli of pulmonary tuberculosis come out with sputum, and the tubercle bacilli of bone tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis, and scrofula come out with pus. The tubercle bacilli of intestinal tuberculosis come out with feces, and the tubercle bacilli of kidney tuberculosis come out with urine.</p>
<p>"Anti-Tuberculosis Element" has been carefully studied by Dr. Yu and is considered to be a special drug for the treatment of various tuberculosis, with remarkable efficacy. It can radically cure tuberculosis in all stages.</p>
<p>After the reporter had a good chat with Dr. Yu at Xin Ya yesterday and visited the various departments of the institute, he showed the bacteria glass tubes made in the oven, explaining that the temperature in the box is often around 3,000 degrees, allowing the bacteria in the tube to spread and reproduce, and showed the bacteria glass tubes that had been in the oven and those that had not been in the oven, giving detailed explanations.

<h3>How to Study Botany (II)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shanzheng</p>
<p>(III) How to Study Botany</p>
<p>(A) Research Methods The principles and methods of research are generally the same as those of zoology. I will present some simple and easy-to-implement methods below:</p>
<p>1. Observe carefully at any time and in any place: Plants grow in all seasons, and they differ from season to season. Some grow in the spring and wither in the summer, some grow in the summer and wither in the autumn or winter, and some produce leaves in the spring, bloom in the summer, and bear fruit in the autumn. Once the opportunity has passed, it is difficult to find suitable materials. Therefore, we must study the external morphology, development, and relationship with the environment of plants at any time and in any place to obtain correct knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Use a microscope to observe the internal structure: A microscope is an important tool for studying botany. We cut plant organs such as roots, stems, and leaves into thin slices, place them on glass slides, and observe them carefully under a microscope. Then we can learn about the internal cells and tissues. Lower plants (algae), such as Spirogyra, Closterium, and diatoms, can be directly clipped between glass slides and magnified for observation under a microscope, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>3. Cultivate plants: We must understand the reproduction, growth status, and nutritional physiology of plants. We cannot understand these things without personally cultivating plants. The cultivation place does not need to be large, such as a flower pot in front of the courtyard. Plants such as potato tubers can grow buds from eye-like structures. Transplanting them into the soil can grow new plants. Similarly, seeds such as broad beans or soybeans can germinate and grow when buried in the soil. Tender branches of chrysanthemums or roses can be inserted into the soil and watered daily to grow roots. This can be used to experiment with the reproduction of plants, to observe their growth status, and to save time spent in the wild. Nutrient solutions can also be used to test the relationship between plant nutrition and growth. For example, the lack of potassium or iron will prevent plants from developing fully.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Surged Before Noon</h3>
<p>English Exchange Rate Reached Unprecedented High, Closing Rate Stabilized</p>
<p>HSBC Gradually Supplied US Dollars, Speculative Surge Halted</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC listed at 9:30 AM, the English exchange rate shrank by 1875, appearing at an unprecedented high of 2 pence 8125. The US exchange rate shrank by 625, reaching 4.6875 yuan. There were no markets for French, German, and Japanese currencies. The exchange rates for Indian and Hong Kong currencies also shrank sharply. The English-US exchange rate in the gray market tightened first and then fell. After opening in the morning, Chinese merchants initially bought US dollars at 4.8125 and 4.75 yuan, which were difficult to obtain. Import foreign firms also settled their accounts. It was heard that Japanese banks were making up for losses, so the US exchange rate at HSBC's small counter shrank to 4.6875 yuan, so it also tightened to the same level as the higher price. The English gold price also saw a new high of 2 pence 8125. Around 9:45 AM, it was heard that HSBC was supplying US dollars at 4.75 yuan, halting the speculative surge. American banks also supplied US dollars, so the exchange rate gradually recovered, reaching 4.8125 yuan for US dollars, finally matching the English exchange rate. The US exchange rate tightened slightly, and transactions became sparse. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Speculated Simultaneously</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign telegrams indicated that the English-US exchange rates in the silver market had not changed. Exchange rates between various countries and Shanghai shrank by 0.0625 for English currency and 0.01 for US currency, while the rest remained stable. The central listing price was stable for all exchange rates. The opening selling prices of banks in the domestic market were 2 pence 84375 for English currency and 4.8125 yuan for US dollars, both the same as the closing prices of the previous day. It was heard that Japanese banks were still secretly buying, and importers and speculators were also competing to buy at 4.8125 yuan and 4.75 yuan. Banks were reluctant to supply. HSBC's listing price shrank, and the silver balance tax was still 224.25%. The US exchange rate at the small counter also shrank to 4.6875 yuan, so banks were only willing to supply at the higher price. The English gold price also tightened to 2 pence 8125. It was heard that HSBC was offering to sell August US dollars at 4.75 yuan, and American banks were also becoming more willing to supply, ending the speculative surge. An American bank sold August US dollars at 4.78125 yuan to an importer. The exchange rate then fell back to 4.8125 yuan for sale. The English gold price also saw a recovery. At noon, the spot price for both current and September English exchange rates was 2 pence 84375, and the US exchange rate was 4.78125 yuan (some were also willing to sell at 4.8125 yuan), which was the same as the previous day for English currency and 0.03125 tighter for US currency.</p>
<p>Tianjin's English and US Currencies Tightened Consistently</p>
<p>Tianjin, 9th (Saturday) Telegram: The exchange rate market opened sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate tightened by 0.125 to 3 pence 3125. The New York telegraphic transfer rate shrank by 0.25 to 5.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 0.75 yuan to 86.50 yuan. The "Lianchao" gray market price rose by 0.25 yuan to 55.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Fluctuated Repeatedly: Dangerous Gold Rush</h3>
<p>After Reaching High Price of 7220 Yuan, Confidence in Upward Trend Began to Waver</p>
<p>Yesterday's gray market for gold, despite being a half-day business on Saturday morning, was still treacherous. It started with a sharp rise, followed by a sudden fall. After reaching the 7,200 yuan mark, it quickly retreated, causing the confidence of those betting on an upward trend to waver. After opening in the morning, due to the expectation that Hong Kong telegraphic transfers would not arrive and the suspicion that HSBC would stop listing prices, foreign exchange banks in the city were reluctant to supply, leading to a sharp tightening. Some Shanghai West groups speculated, and Lintai rushed to buy 10,000 taels. Securities firms, gold firms, and silver firms also absorbed gold, so the price soared to a new high of 7,220 yuan amid widespread speculation. Later, it was heard that HSBC was listing prices as usual and selling US dollars at 4.75 yuan, which stabilized market sentiment. The bulls were greatly disappointed, and gold firms such as Chengji and Hesheng dumped their holdings. Another Shanghai West group increased their sales, and securities firms also re-entered the market, causing the price to fall quickly to around 7,100 yuan. Ultimately, the price still rose by 68 yuan. The volume of transactions for the day was 130,000 to 140,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Cash transactions were rare. Yida sold 40 taels, jewelry stores sold 20 taels, and Shunyuan sold 10 taels. The price then reached an unprecedented high of 8,880 yuan, a further increase of 80 yuan, causing jewelry prices to also reach a new high of 910 yuan, a price never seen since listing.</p>
<p>Futures Prices Have Risen for Five Consecutive Days</p>
<p>The opening price for each bar (10 taels) this morning at 9:15 AM was 7,090 yuan, 25 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. The price bottomed out at 7,080 yuan. Suddenly, favorable rumors spread, and Lintai, Yida, Xianghe, Hengji, Yiyuan, Shihe, Decheng, and retail investors rushed to buy, causing the price to soar past 7,100 yuan and then 7,200 yuan, an increase of 140 yuan. The price reached a high of 7,220 yuan. Later, it was heard that the US exchange rate had stopped tightening and that HSBC had sold US dollars, which stabilized market sentiment. Chengji, Defu, Yida, Dingsheng, Dafeng, and Hesheng began to sell, causing the price to fall sharply. When it was heard that US dollars could be settled at 4.8125 yuan, Xiangxingyong, Mingfeng, Xinfengyong, and Yiyuan also competed to sell. The Shanghai West group increased their sales, and the price fell back by 140 yuan to 7,080 yuan. At that time, Lintai came in to buy again, and Chida, Yida, and Xinfengyong also purchased. The US exchange rate softened slightly, and the price rose by 100 yuan to 7,180 yuan. Defu, Hesheng, and Chengji sold again, and the price fell to 7,110 yuan. The Russian fathers raised the price. The noon closing price was 7,133 yuan, a further increase of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. The price has risen for five consecutive days, for a total increase of 452 yuan. The settlement price for August US dollars was 4.78125 yuan, which was 7,283 yuan, an increase of 150 yuan. After closing, the price rose to 7,142 yuan and then fell back to 7,125 yuan. There was a difference of 140 yuan between the high and low prices during the half-day period. There were no reports of open trading in the afternoon. The retail price of gold at cash stores was 8,950 yuan, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buybacks. There was no market for current margin calls.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Reach 910 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry at jewelry stores, such as Datongxing and Xintongxing, rose by 10 yuan at 10:00 AM, reaching 910 yuan, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buybacks.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Opened High at 21 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both current and futures prices for silver and gold rise sharply. English and US gold pounds also continued to rise by 5 yuan. The trend of English gold notes was firm, and the market price remained stable. The US dollar note opened at 2,035 yuan. After opening, Rentaiyong and Zhicheng purchased, raising the price to 70 yuan. United, Shunyuan, Zhenhe, Xiangyuan, and Yongliji sold, lowering the price to 30 yuan. Yintai and Tongxing purchased, raising the price again to 45 yuan. The noon closing price was 2,042 yuan, an increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price rose to 21 yuan. The trend of Hong Kong notes was increasingly popular, with the evening price reaching 5.65 yuan. The Japanese gold note remained stable, with the evening price still at the original 2.3 yuan. The trend of Korean notes continued to rise, with the evening price reaching 1.84 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Due to Delicate Sino-Thai Relations, Foreign Rice is Stirring Up Trouble Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend of foreign rice became more intense. Both futures and spot rice prices rose sharply. The hoarding merchants originally hoped for good news, and the sharp shrinkage of exchange rates and the tightening of Thai-Japanese relations stimulated the merchants' excitement. The "throwing the top hat" and "kicking the ball" types emerged in response to the times, taking the opportunity to become active. The trend of the previous day ended, and the tide receded from the market. Domestic and foreign merchants, as well as shops in this street, inquired about prices, and the atmosphere in the market became tense. Buying voices were boiling, and market prices rose higher and higher. Spot Xiaojiao rice rose to 126 yuan, No. 1 Saigon rice reached 137.5 yuan, No. 2 rice reached 126.5 yuan, and broken rice reached 97 yuan. No. 1 Siamese and Mindang rice opened at 130 yuan, and Huowen rice reached 133.5 yuan. Trading at the Yinghua Company was also quite active, with Xiaojiao rice reaching 153 yuan, broken rice reaching 109.5 yuan, and No. 2 Siamese rice reaching 143.5 yuan, a sharp increase of 3-5 yuan compared to the previous day. It was later heard that Xinchangsheng had sold 1,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice ready for shipment at a price of only 150 yuan, but the actual sales were sluggish. Merchants became timid and withdrew, and the market immediately reversed and fell, with a sharp drop of 1-3 yuan. However, the prices were still higher than the closing prices of the previous day by 1-2 yuan. Xiaojiao rice at Yinghua Company (1 stone, 2.5 dou) fell from 152.5 yuan to 151.6 yuan to 151 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice fell from 142.5 yuan to 142 yuan to 141.3 yuan. Spot Xiaojiao rice returned to 123.5 yuan. The total transaction volume for spot rice was 20,000 bags, and for Yinghua Company rice, it was 1,200 tons. The closing prices for spot rice were: No. 1 Saigon rice at 136 yuan, Central rice at 133-134 yuan, No. 2 rice at 124.5 yuan, 124 yuan, and high at 126.5 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice at 124 yuan, Mindang rice at 140 yuan, Central rice at 131 yuan, 130 yuan, fixed at 126-127 yuan, Jiafo rice at 131.5 yuan, 131 yuan, Yinhangzhan Xiaowen rice at 124 yuan, Waizhan rice at 123 yuan, and Tokyo Jianjian rice at 116 yuan. Broken rice rose from 96 yuan to 91 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of thick and thin japonica rice, and the repeated increase in foreign rice prices, the market sentiment uniformly trended upward, and prices rose by 2 yuan. Early and late rice from Kainan Port was priced at 153.5 yuan to 150 yuan. Wuxi original-packed white japonica rice was priced at 147 yuan. Pudong new japonica rice was even higher due to its seasonal freshness, so despite its softer texture, it also increased by 2 yuan, with a transaction volume of 6 dans and a price of 159 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the long-term shortage of domestic glutinous rice, the market inventory was also depleted. Hong Kong white yuan rice, following the lead of foreign rice, also increased by about 2 yuan, opening high at 126 yuan, followed by yellow rice at 120 yuan, and glutinous green rice at 115 yuan to 113 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Followed Suit Quickly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for foreign flour saw a sharp rise. On the sales side, after the price of rice and noodles in Tianjin rose, the North China merchants' appetite gradually increased. The news of Japan's southward advance resurfaced, and market sentiment was booming. Under the competition between domestic sales and scattered hoarding, Jinlong flour opened at 32.5 yuan and rose to 32.8 yuan, while Fort flour was at 33.9 yuan and Bell Tower flour was at 34.45 yuan, an increase of nearly 1 yuan compared to the previous day. There were also miscellaneous brands such as Fish and Bird at 32.8 yuan and Banana brand at 33 yuan. The market unanimously trended upward. However, the situation eased in the afternoon due to some merchants selling off their holdings. Jinlong flour retreated to 31.6 yuan and 31.5 yuan. Other goods were still competing. The market outlook was not optimistic due to the rapid increase in prices.</p>
<p>Due to the impact of wind and rain, the supply of wheat was scarce. Although Japanese and Chinese flour mills released prices for purchases, there was no corresponding spot supply. It was heard that Japanese mills were receiving about 200-300 bags per day at their retail outlets, while Chinese mills had almost no supply. The purchase prices of the mills remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Factory Yarn Occasionally Sold Off; Despite High Prices, Japanese Yarn Still Struggled to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, but the situation was chaotic. This was due to inconsistent market sentiment. At the same time, the trading volume of spot yarn was not as high as the previous day. Although foreign exchange rates shrank and margin calls rose, yarn prices did not rise accordingly. In fact, the environment was unfavorable. Factories occasionally sold off, and industry sentiment tended towards selling short for Shuangma yarn. However, securities firms and gold firms were in long positions, and the pull of both sides seemed to be strong. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,625 yuan, and the low price was 1,593 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon due to the usual weekend closure. The current yarn market was still in consolidation. Considering the raw materials, yarn prices could not be loose. According to market sentiment, most people were bearish due to the occasional sell-off by factories, which greatly impacted the market. However, the price of Japanese yarn was very high, and outsiders occasionally absorbed it.</p>
<p>The opening momentum of Shuangma yarn was stable. As some holders took profits, the opening price was 1,615 yuan. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange rates had shrunk and margin calls had risen, and market sentiment improved, rising to 1,625 yuan. However, sales were not strong, and gold prices fell slightly, causing the market to loosen and fall to 1,605 yuan. Short covering caused the price to rise back to 1,614 yuan. Towards the close, the price suddenly fell due to the factory selling off, making the market sentiment weak, and the closing price was 1,593 yuan. The transaction volume during the half-day period was 7,125 bales. The sales volume of each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 125 bales, fellow traders 7,000 bales, totaling 7,125 bales</p>
<p>The Shuangma futures yarn market saw erratic ups and downs, and the trend was chaotic. Although US cotton continued to fall, the spot yarn market was strong, and market sentiment was strong when the market opened in the morning. Therefore, it continued the upward trend of the previous day and rose again. The opening price for August futures was 1,472 yuan, a sharp increase of 3 yuan. Afterwards, it continued to rise, reaching a high of 1,480 yuan. The opening price for September futures was 1,555 yuan, up 8 yuan, and reached a high of 1,560 yuan. The opening price for October futures was 1,565 yuan, and the high price was traded. Therefore, due to the softening of the gold market and the spot yarn market, the bulls began to fluctuate and sold off their holdings. As expected, the market fell back. As a result, the closing prices were 1,465 yuan for August futures, 1,535 yuan for September futures, and 1,549 yuan for October futures, a decrease of 4-15 yuan. In summary, if the spot yarn market is not actively sold, the futures yarn market will also be difficult to remain strong. However, the foreign exchange and gold markets have many fluctuations, so changes in the yarn market may fluctuate accordingly. However, considering the relationship with actual sales, the potential for upward movement may be less than the downward momentum. The total transaction volume for the half-day period yesterday was 8,520 bales, a decrease of 5,160 bales compared to the previous day. As of the 8th, the stock balance for the past three months was 24,550 bales, including 6,500 bales for August, 9,220 bales for September, and 8,830 bales for October. Sellers included 4,580 bales short by No. 2, 2,380 bales short by No. 16, 1,550 bales short by No. 67, 1,150 bales short by No. 52, and 1,050 bales short by No. 61. Buyers included 1,080 bales long by No. 58, 970 bales long by No. 14, 930 bales long by No. 5, 810 bales long by No. 7, and 740 bales long by No. 35. The market prices for the entire day are listed in the table below:</p>
<h3>US Government: Reduced Cotton Production Report</h3>
<p>Washington Telegram: The US Department of Agriculture's Cotton Production Report announced that the estimated US cotton harvest for the first season this year is 10,817,000 bales, a decrease of 612,000 bales compared to the same period last year. The percentage condition is 72 points for normal years, and the yield per acre is 224.4 pounds. The relevant situation for the same period in the past five years is recorded in the original telegram on the left (unit: thousands of bales, 500 pounds per bale).</p>
<p>The US cotton statistics from August 1st to 8th this year are also recorded in the telegram on the left (500 pounds per bale).</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Hoarding: Transactions Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Although the spot cotton situation is strong, consumption is weak, and market sentiment is quite firm. Holders are not willing to sell temporarily, and those who intend to sell are asking for very high prices. As foreign exchange rates have shrunk, the converted price has naturally increased. However, there are still few buyers, and transactions have become thin.</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai foreign firms on foreign cotton order transactions indicates that the market situation is still strong and prices are high, and market sentiment is excited. At the same time, various parties are actively gathering spot goods, but due to hoarding by holders and excessive price increases, the number of transactions in recent days has remained low.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to selling pressure, then rebounded due to the unfavorable field report for shorts, but finally fell again due to profit-taking by longs and selling by Southern firms. As a result, the closing price fell by 7-9 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market continued to be suspended, but evening off-market transactions were slightly weaker due to speculative buying and profit-taking by longs. The final price fell by about 4 rupees compared to the previous day. The forecast for the market opening today is an increase of 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Securities: Unstable Bond Market, Spinning in Circles</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds remained weak yesterday. However, Gongmao and Tianyu absorbed types A and B, causing them to rebound by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The market was sluggish, and transactions were thin, in stark contrast to Shuangma and gold. It can be seen that public bonds focus on investment and are more stable, while speculators tend to flock to gold and Shuangma yarn. Yesterday was Saturday, and paper transactions were only conducted in the morning. Gongmao actively bought types A and B, and Tianyu exclusively bought type B. Jiucheng, Tongkang, and Jiufeng all had some intake. Xiexing, Yuanlian, Xinhua, Renchang supplied in succession. The trend remained in a spin and was not easy to develop in the near term. As the first payment of principal and interest due at the end of July had not yet been received, market sentiment was worried. As a result, prices for types A and B rose by 0.3-0.55 yuan, types C and E fell by 0.1-0.3 yuan, and no transactions were made for type D. The total transaction volume was about 800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Varied Colors and Whitewares, Uneven Cloth Bottom</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market trend was firm yesterday. Sales in Guangdong and Hong Kong were good. However, due to the tense situation in the Pacific, there was a wait-and-see attitude. As the raw material of fine yarn rose sharply, the opening price of poplin and flannel continued to rise by 0.5-1 yuan. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Some whitewares, coarse and fine cloth, and twill increased by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The street traded more than 500 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong and Hong Kong traded more than 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Nanyang traded more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, khaki, and bleached twill.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth whitewares are slacker, and the colored goods are still strong. The fine cloth for all months on the exchange fell by 0.14-0.35 yuan per piece. The single order from the leading factory in the spot market opened strong in the morning, with the high price selling at 53.8 yuan. As the price of yarn fell, it turned to a decline. The closing price at noon was 53.25 yuan, equal to the market price of the previous day. The price of colored goods increased because the prices of fine yarn, dyeing, finishing, and other items had increased. Market sentiment was trending upward, and the opening price rose sharply by 0.02 yuan per yard. The price fell in the middle due to the price drop on the exchange, but it recovered at the close. The new single new tax for Sijunzi cloth was 1.755 yuan, the new single old tax was 1.745 yuan, and the old single old tax was 1.695 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Merchants Hoard and Manipulate Prices, Edible Oil Reaches New Highs Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Prices Rose Again by Five to Ten Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the surge in edible oil prices intensified again. The oil merchants are trying to imitate rice dealers, seeking to make exorbitant profits, manipulating the market, and hoarding goods without any scruples. Prices are being driven up one after another, like a race, repeatedly setting new records, which is causing hardship for the common people and increasing the burden on their lives. It is reported that 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were sold at a record high of 272 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold for 170 yuan to 272 yuan. 60 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 190 yuan, and 70 pieces of soybean oil were priced at 190 yuan. 150 dan of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 210 yuan. 1,000 dan of clear oil were priced at 170 yuan to 181.5 yuan. 600 dan of rapeseed oil were priced at 185 yuan to 187 yuan. More than 1,000 dan of Japanese rapeseed oil were priced at 175 yuan to 182 yuan, a huge increase of five to ten yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Tianjin Merchants Scour for Dutch Red Sugar, Price Increase is Particularly Large</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw coarse white sugar still absorbed due to good public sentiment. The tight supply showed no signs of weakening, and prices rose by another two to three yuan. Dutch red sugar, however, saw a larger price increase due to the insufficient supply and Tianjin merchants scrambling to buy it. The company's forward coarse white sugar for delivery on August 10th was initially priced at 113.2 yuan, then rose to 115 yuan to 114.2 yuan, before falling back to 113.5 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan. The end of August opened at 116.8 yuan, reaching 117.5 yuan, before settling at 115.8 yuan to 115.1 yuan. The association's spot price for second-grade coarse white sugar for July delivery was 114.5 yuan to 114 yuan, an increase of 3.5 yuan. June was 114 yuan, 113 yuan, 112.5 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan. May was 113 yuan to 112 yuan, with the same increase. April was 112 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. March was 111.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar KD brand was 105 yuan to 106 yuan, a sharp increase of 6 yuan. Taikoo refined white B brand was 136 yuan to 137 yuan. HX brand was 116.5 yuan to 117 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan from the previous day's asking price. H brand red sugar was 100 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan from the 7th.</p>

<h3>Movies and Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Ru Bing</p>
<p>Modern film art has already achieved a considerable status in the cultural world, which is an undeniable fact. We believe that this kind of "audio-visual textbook" is indeed the best educational tool, and its influence on children is even more closely related. Adults watch movies purely for entertainment or to receive some extremely beneficial education in their minds, but the influence they receive in terms of psychology and knowledge is certainly also profound.</p>
<p>As for children watching movies, in addition to entertainment, they also receive a great educational effect. Fairy tales, fables, and stories are certainly gifts to children, but after they are "cinematized," the interest given to children will be even stronger, and the influence will be even more profound.</p>
<p>Many children in Shanghai love movies, but the subject matter of current movies mostly lacks meaning and is not suitable for children to watch, because these films are harmful to their psychology and physiology.</p>
<p>According to the results of tests, children like slapstick comedies the most. Specifically, boys like: 1. Martial arts films, 2. Detective films, 3. Slapstick comedies, 4. Adventure films. Girls like: 1. Slapstick comedies, 2. Adventure films, 3. Detective films, 4. Martial arts films. What they have in common is that they like slapstick comedies. As for literary and artistic films and biographical films, they are not welcome at all because their level of knowledge is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Cartoons can be said to be very popular among children, such as "Snow White," "Gulliver's Travels," and "Pinocchio." They are all extremely interesting and colorful cartoons that arouse their strong interest and a sense of the beauty of colors, which are beneficial to their psychological knowledge.</p>
<p>What is most undesirable are some horror films and supernatural films, etc., which stimulate children when they watch them, causing them to be unable to fall asleep at night or have nightmares after sleeping. It is best not to let children watch this kind of film to avoid accidents. Therefore, making interesting educational films is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the films, the seats and lighting in theaters should also be reformed, because inaccurate angles and unsuitable distances often damage children's eyesight, and some even become nearsighted as a result. These shortcomings that endanger children's physiology also need to be improved urgently.</p>
<h3>Smart and Brave Will</h3>
<p>— Yao Yao</p>
<p>During the last European War, there was a French elementary school student named Will. At that time, he was only eleven years old and lived with his mother in a village called Henry near Paris. Because he was very smart and willing to work hard, he was not only praised at school but also often received candy rewards from his mother when he returned home.</p>
<p>One early morning, a group of disorganized and panicky defeated soldiers suddenly came to Henry Village. The number was more than sixty. They poured in like crows returning to their nests, and they were all in a sorry state, without guns or cannons. The German army behind them was encircling them in a semi-circular formation. Behind the village was a wide river, and the bridge over the river had already been blown up. There was no boat in the river. How could these six thousand soldiers cross? While everyone was in a panic, a child suddenly stood up and said loudly to the crowd:</p>
<p>"It's very dangerous now. You must quickly build a bridge! There is still a lot of wood here that can be used. As for the pursuers behind, I will try to stop them. The sooner, the better!" Although he was just a child, his tone of voice was like that of an adult. After he finished speaking, he quickly ran straight to the German army's location, holding a white flag in his hand.</p>
<p>He was taken into the camp by a German soldier.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?" asked a man who looked like an officer.</p>
<p>"Eleven years old."</p>
<p>"What are you doing here alone? Aren't you afraid?" The officer's French was not very good.</p>
<p>"I am here on behalf of our soldiers to surrender."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it. Why did you send this little child here?"</p>
<p>"The people in our village have all fled, and the soldiers have not eaten anything for three days and three nights. They are eating now, so there is no one else besides me." After saying that, the officer ran up a mound and looked into the distance with binoculars. Sure enough, there were many dark figures moving. So he ran down again and said to the child, "You just sit here and wait for them to finish eating. Then you lead them here, understand?" "Understood, you go." The child sat there.</p>
<p>After a while, the officer rushed in fiercely and asked, "What's going on?" The child replied, "They have probably all fled, escaping over a simple bridge." "Bah! Spy!" Before he finished speaking, the tip of a bayonet had pierced the child's throat, and blood splattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Children! He was the smart and brave Will!</p>
<h3>Writing Letters</h3>
<p>— Yang Yi</p>
<p>Children! Don't you often have letters coming and going? Or a neighbor brings a letter and asks you to read it to them, and sometimes even asks your father to write a letter for them. Children, do you read and write letters? If you can't, why don't you learn?</p>
<p>When you do compositions at school, the teacher gives a topic, and you often can't do it? Some children make up things to write on paper. If the topic is "A Letter to Dad" or "A Letter to Brother," it's really hard to do, because you see Dad every day and there's really nothing to say. And maybe you don't even have a brother?</p>
<p>Writing letters is really necessary! It can practice your writing ability. Many things you want to say can be turned into words. It can also connect feelings, like with your teacher, classmates, or relatives in faraway places. If you write a letter to them, they will be very happy and rush to write back to you.</p>
<p>How do you write your letter? Start with a salutation, like Mr. ××, Academic Brother ××, Cousin ××... Then say whatever you want to say, like two people talking, asking about their health, whether their studies are improving... If you are writing to someone who is more knowledgeable than you, you can also ask them to correct and guide your mistakes.</p>
<p>Like in the old-fashioned way of writing letters, you have to use phrases like "Respectfully submitted to your knees" when writing to parents, or "Big seal, hereby opening" to peers. We beginners don't need to use that. Regarding the method of writing letters, children can refer to books on writing letters.</p>
<p>Children, why don't you give it a try? Writing letters is composition with a target, and it won't be boring. I wish you success.</p>
<h3>Watermelon Lantern</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Only a quarter of the long summer vacation has passed, and there are still three-quarters of the time coming slowly. Children, during this summer vacation, the work that you find most interesting is drawing, silhouette cutting (collage), paper folding, and various woodworking projects with bamboo and wood, etc. It seems to be more energetic than doing repetitive homework like reading and writing. The reason is that children's personalities are mostly active. Now, the author will write down some methods for making "watermelon lanterns" and introduce them to you children: Watermelon is the most seasonal cold drink right now. In addition to adding salt and sun-drying the leftover watermelon rinds and stir-frying them for meals, the craft of making "watermelon lanterns" is also excellent.</p>
<p>The method of making watermelon lanterns is not difficult, it is very simple. First, take a watermelon (it is best to use a "three-white watermelon" with white seeds, white flesh, and white skin) and cut off a small half (about one-third) of the watermelon lid at the vine. Then, dig out the watermelon pulp and seeds. Then, scrape the watermelon skin with a copper spoon or enamel spoon until it is very thin, making the skin thin and transparent, emitting a green and shiny luster (note that the watermelon skin should not be scraped too thin to prevent it from being punctured). After the first step is completed, the second step is to cut thick cardboard into a circular shape (about the size of an old silver coin) to make two candle base plates. String them with thick lead wire and clamp them inside and outside the bottom of the watermelon. At the same time, use thick tin wire to make a candle holder about an inch long at the center of the candle base plate. After this work is completed, the third step is to draw landscapes, flowers, figures, or animals, insects, or draw the image of the founding father Sun Yat-sen, or draw the images of the great men of the world's democracies today, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, etc. around the watermelon shell with a light ink brush, as desired, to make them as lifelike as possible. If you want to keep it simple, you can also draw plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and rocks... After finishing well, then take a sharp foot knife and gently carve along the brush strokes to reveal a more transparent image. Then, thread lead wire around the edge of the watermelon top, hang it up in a triangular pattern, and at night, light a small white paraffin candle or a small red candle and insert it into the candle holder at the bottom of the watermelon. A watermelon lantern is complete. It is so small and exquisite, so green, and the shadows of people flicker. It really feels clear and lovely! I remember when I was a child, my late cousin Ran Qianjun was the most skilled in this art. He painted well and carved skillfully, and he was praised by his parents. If this small craft of making "watermelon lanterns" can be made with ingenuity and promoted, I think a "watermelon lantern" will definitely occupy a hundred seats in the toy market in the summer, selling at a good price, and it will be another small craft business of "prosperous business and making money."</p>
<h3>Steamed Buns</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Because the price of rice has soared to more than 100 yuan per dan, Ah Hui's family bought a few bags of flour as a substitute for rice, so that the consumption of rice can be reduced, which means saving some expenses. Indeed, in this year of expensive rice, everything is being "mined," striving to save to the lowest limit.</p>
<p>Today, Ah Hui's family is making steamed buns again. In the morning, his mother brought back a piece of yeast when she bought groceries. It was wrapped in tin foil, and the color of the yeast was grayish-white, looking like a piece of mushroom tofu.</p>
<p>"Brother, what is yeast? What is it made of?" Ah Hui heard his mother saying: This is a piece of yeast. These two strange and new names made no impression at all in his simple mind. It looked just like a piece of dried tofu. He took it to ask Ah Ming.</p>
<p>"Yeast is a kind of living plant that we cannot see with our eyes. It is composed of countless single-celled plants. Unless you magnify it under a microscope to observe it, you will believe it. Otherwise, you will never believe it. There are good yeasts and bad yeasts. For example, food that has been left overnight is not delicious, and if you put glue for a few days, it will turn yellow-green and moldy, and it will become very smelly. These are all caused by bad yeasts, and the yeasts used to make steamed buns are all beneficial to us. They are as small as about one-thousandth of a centimeter in size. They are colorless, slightly oval-shaped small particles. Although they are very small, their ability to reproduce is very high. How do they produce small yeasts? Because they are a single cell, as long as one single cell is divided into two, it becomes two new cells, so the size and shape of the small yeast are exactly the same as the old yeast. They are not like mother and child, but like a pair of twins. Then two divides into four, four divides into eight, eight divides into sixteen, sixteen divides into thirty-two,... the more they divide, the more there are, until they divide into an unknown number. If the place they live is not very comfortable, they will no longer use this kind of fission reproduction. Instead, they will grow one or two tumor-like things at one end of the old yeast cell. The more they grow, the bigger they get. Later, the tumor-like things become detached from the old cell, and this becomes a new yeast, but it is a little smaller than the original one and looks a bit like mother and child. This is called budding reproduction. This is the general idea about yeast."</p>
<p>Ah Hui didn't ask any more questions, because his mother called him to bring the piece of yeast over. Later, he only saw his mother dissolving the yeast in warm water and mixing it into the flour. After two or three hours, the pile of flour actually "swelled" up. Ah Hui was stunned to see it. At this time, Ah Ming also came over and interrupted his stunned look.</p>
<p>"Brother, look at the ball of flour in the basin. It has now "swelled" into a full basin. Is this the power of yeast? Why can it make the flour "swell"?" Ah Hui asked curiously again.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is entirely the power of yeast. You should know that yeast is a very active plant. When it is dissolved in water and mixed into the flour, you must pay attention that the water for dissolving the yeast cannot be too hot, otherwise the yeast will be scalded to death by the hot water, because they are also living things. When they are mixed into the flour, they feel very stuffy, and they also need to breathe. You should also know that flour is rich in starch, and sugar is made from starch. So when yeast is locked in the flour, when they respire, they decompose the starch and absorb the oxygen in it, and release carbon dioxide gas, which forms many small holes in the flour dough and turns the starch into alcohol. If you don't believe it, smell the swollen flour, and there will definitely be some wine smell. This is the same as our human respiration, so it can be seen that all living things have this respiration. This is also called fermentation, which is very beneficial to us. For example, steamed buns that have not been fermented are hard and not tasty, and they are not easy to digest. Once fermented, everyone welcomes them."</p>
<p>When Ah Ming finished speaking, and Ah Hui carefully observed it, he confirmed that what his brother said was correct. This is Ah Hui's unique scientific spirit. Children, are you also like this?</p>

<h3>Pauline Goddard Talks About Charlie Chaplin</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>For several years, the relationship between Charlie Chaplin and Pauline Goddard has always been elusive, and no one can guess whether they are married or not. It was not until "The Great Dictator" was presented at the Broadway "Metropolitan Theater" that Chaplin himself appeared on the stage to meet the audience and introduced Pauline Goddard as "Mrs. Charlie Chaplin." Thus, Pauline Goddard's status was officially confirmed in this sentence. This article is about her talking about Charlie Chaplin as his wife, which is quite unique. It is specially translated to share with readers.</p>
<p>"Marrying Chaplin is like living on top of a constantly erupting volcano." Pauline said contentedly, and her eyes told you that she was very satisfied. "If you want me to describe a good husband, I can simply say that he is not a good husband, but he is an exciting and interesting person. Being with him is a very good marriage for me. Because I like this kind of common life, I like living a dangerous and exciting life. He doesn't know what fear is. He is not afraid of the dangers of life and the dangers of his future career. He is fearless of anything. Sometimes, in the middle of the night or at three or four o'clock in the morning when dawn is approaching, he wakes up and drives to the seaside to watch the sunrise, and then has breakfast there. The crazier he is, the happier he is.</p>
<p>"Ordinary women can get comfort from their husbands," Pauline continued, "but I can't expect Chaplin to give it to me. He is always not punctual. If he says he will be back for dinner at seven o'clock, he will be late until eight or nine o'clock, or he will be back before six o'clock. Therefore, all the food must be prepared in advance, and the cook will bring it out when he enters the door. This way he will be satisfied. He often forgets about appointments, and he doesn't pay attention to income and expenses, although I am not used to these either. But I have to worry about it for him.</p>
<p>"Thinking about others is what he is least good at. He will never remember small things. If I want to get a birthday gift, I have to instruct and choose it myself. He never thinks about sending any souvenirs or gifts like flowers. Christmas is the same. He thinks there should be Christmas, but there is no need to celebrate. He doesn't want any Christmas cards in the house. However, last Christmas was an exception. He gave me a gold chain with a heart pendant, and inside there was a photo of himself. This may be because "The Great Dictator" was a complete success!</p>
<p>"Chaplin seems to think that he is the only person living in the world, thinking that living for sixty more seconds can make up for sixty seconds of travel time." Pauline said with a smile, a smile that came from the heart. "Although he doesn't have eloquent speech, he can write fluently, so he likes to talk to smart and intelligent people. His hobbies are hunting, fishing, reading novels, and paying attention to world news. All his passions are hidden inside. On the surface, he never shows any passionate expressions to you.</p>
<p>Regarding Chaplin, Pauline said shyly, "No one can understand him. Sometimes he is very conservative, but sometimes he is like a naughty bad child. He will make playful and cunning gestures to annoy others, and he also likes to seize on other people's weaknesses and laugh at them. He is also good at lying. You can't tell whether what he says is true or false, but he is not like this about important things. Because he is just joking about unimportant things..."</p>
<p>"Ring! Ring..." It was Chaplin's phone call, so it interrupted her sentence.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters are Delicate Silk</p>
<p>The lyricist then began to write poems in the boat. Yuan Yuan helped him grind the ink. All the way back to Hengtang, the lyricist had already completed twenty poems, truly possessing the talent of Li Bai leaning on his horse. That night, the lyricist ate dinner in Yuan Yuan's boudoir and drank until he was tipsy before taking the boat back to the city. That night, Yuan Yuan dreamed that she was still playing on the mountain. In an instant, she couldn't see the lyricist. Suddenly, a cloud of black clouds surged up in the sky, and the wind howled as if it was about to rain. She was panicking in her heart when she suddenly saw Flower Butterfly leading a group of people running up the mountain from below, holding weapons in their hands, looking like a gang of robbers who wanted to rob her. She was extremely frightened and screamed. When she woke up, it was just a dream of Nanke, and she broke out in a cold sweat. Thinking about this dream, it was very vivid. Then she thought that dreams are born from the heart, which was because she had met Flower Butterfly during the day and was not very happy in her heart, so she had this dream. She barely calmed her mind and went back to sleep. The next morning, the weather suddenly became overcast again, as if it was going to rain. The weather in spring is originally changeable, with uncertain sunny and rainy days, and yesterday and today are very different. After Yuan Yuan got up in the morning, finished washing up, and had lunch, she sat at her desk, took out the drafts of the twenty spring tour poems that the pity jade lyricist had chanted in the boat yesterday, and copied them one by one onto Huanhua paper. Yuan Yuan's small regular script was written very beautifully and neatly, which showed her intelligent and elegant nature. In the afternoon, fine rain was weaving outside the window, and the flowers and trees were all wet. Yuan Yuan guessed that the lyricist would not come today, which was best. No other guests came either, so she could rest. Who knew that in the evening, a distinguished guest suddenly came to her boudoir. When he came, the attendants in front of the door were like clouds, and the momentum was magnificent. The neighbors were all surprised and asked who that distinguished guest was. Yuan Yuan's family members were busy serving the honored guests. But when Yuan Yuan saw the old man, she recognized him as the noble person she had met on Lingyan Mountain yesterday, and she couldn't help but feel a jolt in her heart. What made her even more disgusted was that a young man was following closely behind the old man, who was Flower Butterfly, whom she avoided like poison. (138)</p>

<h3>Movie World Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The film "Xifenfei" is doing very well at the box office, which the Guohua authorities also found surprising. Director Zheng Xiaoqiu's technique is clear, beautiful, concise and direct. It is rumored that Guohua will give him an additional reward of 1,000 yuan, which is in fact unprecedented. And Zheng Xiaoqiu's status as a director has indeed risen considerably since the Jin Xing films "The Way of Husband and Wife" and "Fig."</p>
<p>"A chorus of privately funded film productions" – directors, actors, and theater managers… all have such intentions. It is rumored that the film company authorities believe that this trend must not be allowed to spread, because the film companies are suffering significant losses and will persuade and stop them. However, the purpose of some employees' external activities is to compensate for the insufficient regular income. If there are real losses, the film producers will add remuneration as appropriate to reassure them in their original positions.</p>
<p>"Guo Ren Yao", starring Li Zhuozhuo and Wang Yuanlong in Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to be shown at Jincheng Cinema, but it has now been changed to Jindu Cinema, following "Xifenfei."</p>
