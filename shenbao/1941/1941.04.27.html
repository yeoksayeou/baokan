<p>增強外匯比値　陪都人士興奮</p>
<p>重慶　金融界權威人士、頃就平準基金簽訂協定一事評稱、平準基金協定之談判、自昨年十二月初起、迄今爲止、歷時五閱月、中·英、中·美、兩項平準基金協定、均於昨日在華盛頓簽定規定各款即付實施、吾人聞悉之餘、殊感興奮、對我外匯比值之增强、物價之平定、均有極大裨助、意義之重大、無待贅言、年來美國數度對華貸款、其性質例不出經濟範圍、但與國際政治及美國對遠東之基本政策、息息相關、例如去年九月下旬、軸心三國同盟宣告成立、遠東亦爲之震動、盟的成立次日、美國即官布二千五百萬美兀貸華、十一月末美參院銀打委員會與衆院錢幣委員會又一致通過政府以一萬萬美元貸華之決定、是時、英國亦於己身艱苦奮鬥之際、宜布以英金一千萬鎊貸華之舉、爲兩國採取平行政策援助中國之開始，本月十三日、蘇·日甫吿妥協、於日人得意忘形之際、先有羅斯福總統依照軍火租借法案擴大援華之聲明、復有本决協定之加速簽訂、美·英加緊援華、保衛民主、拯救自由之決心、可以窺見一斑、知吾人正爲保衛民主與自由而戰、中·英·美三國之基本立塲、巳趨一致云、（二十六日電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間政界人士、頃巳獲知中·美·英簽訂平準基金協定之訊、若輩大致認此協定爲英·美對華之有效援助、且爲對蘇·日中立條的之部分答覆、權威人士稱、中國平準基金委員會之中國委員、將由國際貿易委員會主席陳光甫·中國銀行上海分行經理貝祖貽·中央銀行業務部牛任席德懋（譯音）担任、英籍委員或將爲中·英平準基金會委員羅傑士、美籍委員或將爲財部美顧問揚格云、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>抵抗獨裁　決不退縮　美總統抨擊林白</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨嚴斥林白上校謂、林白與另一羣人士之堅信軸心國必獲大勝者、僅代表美國一小部分人民心理、此輩猶如若干美國獨立戰爭時軍事屢遭失利前運黑暗之際、有人勸華盛頓乞相、在南北戰爭之時亦然、余本人及美國大多數人民、決心爲防衛民主及民主式生活方式而戰、抵禦獨裁暴主、余本人及美國人民、決不因他國軍力之優越而退縮、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統宣布　美擴大巡邏範圍　必要時將展至全世界各海洋　傳軸心軍侵入格林蘭　美尋求事實將予驅逐</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日宣稱、美國之中立巡邏頃方擴展、並於必要時將擴展至全球之海洋以保衛西半球、同時、羅斯福總統稱、格林蘭島現或已一部被軸心國軍隊所佔領、美國刻方作對該處軸心之措置、然渠謂軸心國軍隊是吾已開抵格林蘭島、渠尙未能確定、總統復稱、美國頃方予希臘以援助、並將繼續不論戰事之「暫時結果」如何、予希臘以援助、有詢以中立巡邏之擴展、是吾將造成一位格林蘭島之「海上安全大道」、總統答稱、渠期望格林蘭島之通路可保安全、並希望該島不復有侵略之行動、羅斯福總統繼稱、渠認爲軸心勢力或巳侵入格林蘭島、渠謂相信軸心國在該島之企圖並非第五縱隊、暗示有較第五縱隊更直接之作爲（或係武裝軍隊）云、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日暗示、倘格林蘭島有軸心國軍隊存在、美國將出以行動、將其逐出該島、此間德國使館稱、關於軸心國在格林蘭島之佔領、並無何種消息、觀察家多揣測羅斯福總統之意、即美國方尋求確定關於所傳佔領一節之事實、而予侵佔者以驅逐、羅斯福總統直接吾認政府有任何成立護航之意向、並謂美國海軍在大西洋之行動、於過去一年半中已實行巡邏、而目前尙屬巡邏之行動、某新聞記者稱、此種巡邏實際上或即係護航之謂、以造成安全之通路、俾便船隻之航駛、羅斯福總統答稱、吾人不能指牛爲馬、而牛即可一變而爲馬也、羅斯福總統特別宣稱、海洋巡邏擴展之新政策、並未造成巴拿馬安全地帶之修改、此不過爲中立巡邏之擴展區域而已、羅斯福總統強調聲稱、巡邏政策於必要時、即可予以擴大、以保衛西半球、渠謂巡邏並不限人西洋、於西半球之防務中認爲必要時、可擴展至全球海洋之任何部份、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨又在新聞記者招待席上聲稱、美國中立巡邏船隻將酌視西半球防務之需要、駛入七海中、美國此時未作護送商船之想云、總統不願參加可擴大其對於護航事見解之特殊討論、惟謂在一年半時期中、美國中立巡邏船隻、行於大西洋東海岸外遠及一千哩之處、而瑪麗蘭州之巡邏區巳加擴大、今將隨時擴漲、此種巡邏並非護航、蓋護航者護送商船以免侵略、而巡邏者乃在某一區域內從事偵查、以防任何侵略的船隻　入西半球也、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　衆院航務委員會已核准一議案、授權總統微用閒擱於美國港內之外船、聞此案之詞句簡直允許將此種外船於英國需要時移交英國、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統咋宣布政策、謂將擴張美國之中立巡邏、而非設立護航制助、以助運送軍用品至英國及其他民主國、此間權威者認爲、羅斯福總統之政策、係與國際公法相符、權威者並以爲此項政策並不違反美國之中立地位、但指出在巡邏戰艦與侵略者之戰艦相遇前、此項政策效果之全力擁護未能明顯、此項印象以爲、如能利用在更廣大之海面偵察之機會、而供給更詳盡之情報、則間接甚有助於英國云、此間認爲、羅斯福總統之所以贊成擴張巡邏、而不贊成護航制度者、乃海軍戰術改變之當然結果、因第一决大戰時所設之護航制度、已不適於現時之狀况也、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>中國在太平洋　具軍事重要性　曾阻止日攻香港企圖</h3>
<p>雪梨、下院議員兼戰事咨讓會工黨代表俾斯萊、本日宜稱、當軍事會議於二月十二日對澳洲發出警吿時、日本軍隊方準備攻奪香港、日方計劃係欲以二萬人佔領香港之一面、而以海南島爲根據之日艦隊、則將在香港之另一面遊弋、但幸而華軍之攻擊、使日本之計劃不能實現、俾斯萊力言、中國在太平洋上有巨大之軍事重要、並謂、日軍有一百萬人及軍艦三百艘從事對華戰事、日、蘇締的後、或可使日本能抽調一部軍隊用於他處、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>大部人民皆信　美將牽入戰爭</h3>
<p>紐約　據四月十日至二十日所舉行之加魯普氏投票測騐、美國人民現有百分之八十二皆信、美國將翠入戰爭、按五個月前、此項數字僅達百分之五十九（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>劍拔弩張之美國外交</h3>
<p>隨件着軸心國在巴爾幹半島的軍事進展，以及日蘇訂的後日本對南太千洋的躍躍欲試，以保障民治國勝利爲國策的華盛頓政府，非獨沒有絲毫畏縮軟化，反而再接再厲，推行更積極更露骨的反侵略政策。</p>
<p>關於遠東，中美平準基金協定已於前日正式簽字，（同時中英協定亦在華盛頓簽字成立，）這不但是美國支持中國法幣的最切實步驟，且是援助中國繼續作戰以制勝日本的强有力武器；在此一協定簽訂之前，羅斯福總統和赫爾國務卿更曾先後明白宣佈：「美國決定立即予中國以具體援助，中國所需要的軍火淸單，已經依照租借法之規定，予以分析及考慮，其中若干業經政府核准運華一；如果再益以羅斯福總統長子之來華聘問，美國政府之投資助修滇緬鐵路，以及昨日東京方面所傳美國艦隊之接防新嘉坡，美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德大將之行將赴新與英當局商訂「六國軍事條的」，可見美國在遠東方面，不僅決意大規模援助中國，以牽掣日本，同時且準備於日閥萬一利用軸心攻勢得手，英國無暇東顧的機會而向南洋蠢動時，以實力與之週旋。</p>
<p>關於歐洲，由於巴爾幹戰事的近於尾聲，希特勒的魔掌漸有伸向大西洋與西地中海之故，英國的處境似乎已格外引起美國的關切，就中允以美國運英戰具時被德方擊沉海底一點，最爲美國當局所焦慮。據隔昨外電，美國國會方面聞已獲悉，美國運英之接濟品，竟有百分之四十已在大西洋北部被德國擊沉；此一消息若果屬實，確是英國當前心腹之患，無怪美海長諾克斯要大聲疾呼，說：「美國必須覔得方法，使美國援英物品能抵達目的地；事已至此，吾人不能退讓，吾人必須有始有終；如英國失敗，則美國即有被完全包圍之可能（暗示日本亦將乘機在遠東襲擊英美屬地），因此吾人若不能覔得或不能實施使英國無需吾人作戰即能單獨獲勝之方法，則結果吾人終必作戰；」赫爾國務卿允其說得露骨，竟明言「美國爲西半球及本國安全計，必須於最適於抵抗之地點作抵抗；」加之羅斯福總統於召集「戰事內閣」進行會商之後，外間即盛傳美國即將派軍艦護送戰具赴英，而一昨羅氏更明白宣佈美國現行「中立巡邏辦法」，頃方擴展範圍，必要時或當擴展至全世界海洋，以保衛西半球；於此可見上述美國運英物品損失情形若果屬實，則今後華盛頓政府縱非立即實施派艦護送辦法，至低限度亦當擴大現行巡邏制度，務使赴英貨船得以安全抵達英倫本部；證諸羅氏一昨所談，希望造成一通往格林蘭島之海上安全大道，可知華府當局對於此事，刻正殫精竭慮，全力以赴，相信不出數日，必有具體決定。一說紐的市長賴伽第亞主張實施一種特殊的「海空巡邏」政策，其法乃於輪船運送戰具前往英國時，先由美國軍艦或飛機在若干里程之外，從事巡邏，倘發見可疑之飛機或潛艇，即發出警告，使後面的輪船及時改道，以避免危險；這種變相的護航辦法，足使美國避免直接干涉戰事的口實，因此更可不致抵觸中立法或租借法的限制條款，的確還值得美國當局的考慮。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可信美國在遠東方面，一方信賴中國的作戰，一方則在南洋採取「嚴陣以待」的姿態，至於在歐洲方面，則因爲英國處境的比較吃緊，美國彷彿已有劍及履及、不惜任何代價，支持英國不敗的決心和準備，是以後此數日，說不定世人將見美國動態的急遽展開。</p>

<p>華盛頓　過去二十四小時內、遠東事件中最饒興趣之發展、厥爲海長諾克斯演詞中列蘇聯於軸心網之方式、近數月來、美蘇關係頗有徐徐轉佳之象、但蘇、日中立條的旣巳簽字、美蘇關係乃趨冷淡、今諾克斯公然宣布美國當軸對於此的之感想、認此爲軸心國現所鑄造用以包圍美國的連鎖之一環、此種意旨、顯然反映此間一種心理發展之趨勢、即凡不與吾人友好者、即與吾人爲敵是已、諾克斯所發美國現漸被包圍之一語、將迅速傳遍全國、衆料國內有識者、將因此而發生何時應打破此包圍圈之問題、究應於此圈尙未迫近時即打破之歟、抑應俟其加緊時而始打破之歟、今者四大洲已將對美合圍、如赫爾所言矣、許多人士認諾克斯關於遠東之言論爲對日之警吿、意謂美國現願意並準備作戰矣、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>外幣無上落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價平穩、英美金鎊因亦無上落、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票變動不大、卒吿微升一分、晚市爲十八元八角六分、香港票趨勢略軟、晚市爲四兀七角六分、此外如新加坡及安南羅比等票、則均趨堅漲、日金票及朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、前者仍站二元一角原盤、後者仍爲一元八角半、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債微漲</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况繼續趨漲、雖不甚猛、却異常穩定、四行復業聞已定於下週一實行、從此金融　趨安定、公債之回漲，實基於日前之猛跌而來、此後公債亦可趨於安定、昨因週六祗做半日交易、協興元信孚聯益等先後相繼買進、生興協康稍有賣出、市價開盤一漲四五角、至收盤在一小時以內、始終安定、僅五分一角上落、結果續漲二角半至五角、成交的計一百二三十萬兀、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成烟華公司股二十股、價爲六十元正、</p>
<h3>紗花　多空看法不同　紗市微有起伏</h3>
<p>紗市仍無精彩可言、但投　的人們看漲者跌、意旨不一、所以微有上升、不過實際情况異常蕭條、港幫納胃殊澀、於是人心暗淡絕少興奮性、惟一般余融舒適之囤戶、仍拖　不願放鬆、但在現紗方面上着想、深恐不易上漲也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百八十六兀、低價爲一千四百七十四元、午後因週尾關係、標金及外滙無市、人心稍定、據云始做一千四百九十兀、後又八十六元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市塲散漫無勁、人氣雖在喊、然成交反爲寥寥無幾、首盤價爲一千四百八十兀、此盤一開、觀察伸手者大有假痴假呆之紳情、旋以標金市價趨弱、買者意興闌珊、跌至一千四百七十四元、在七十七八元之間往返的有一小時半、但至將近十二時左右、塲中貿聲忽起、浮空紛粉抵補、市盤乃徐徐前進、漲至一千四百八十六元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千二百二十二包、茲將各幫買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>囤戶興緻大減　棉市闌珊</h3>
<p>現棉情况冷靜極矣、此因紗銷狹隘、且囤戶手貨充斥、鑒於目前環境欠佳、踢皮球輿緻大爲减色、所以成交殊淸、前途恐有下降之趨勢云、</p>
<p>蘭　花二〇七號家　一〇〇件</p>
<p>又　二〇八　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>火草包一九六·五又　一五〇件</p>
<p>又　一九七　又一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、良以紗市仍無起色、買方意氣銷沉、因之速日市况靜寂、而漸見軟弱也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市靜而堅、因有同業買進、及棉布貿易良好而漲、昨日收盤價格、較之上日的漲四五磅音、又去年八月一日起至今年四月二十五日止美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>上市累計　一〇、二九九、〇〇〇包</p>

<p>至德國　一三九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>各港市存　六、二〇九、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印度棉市亦頗堅定、因空頭抵補活躍、及買方購進甚力而漲、同時又因一都份棉商套賣、及獲利了結而略跌、結果除白洛去四五月份漲九羅比、七八月份漲六羅比外、其餘的漲一三羅比不等、</p>
<h3>疋頭　港地布價　回跌一二元</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢不振、因粵港幫進胃淡薄、港地布價回跌、每疋一元至二元、故白貨賣氣轉盛、售價又見盤小、白貨細布斜紋跌二角半、粗布跌一角至二角半、怡和綸昌漂染布及本廠府綢嗶嘰等細紗綫織品、價仍堅定、本街成交减少、計粗布斜紋漂布等近二百件、粵港幫辦去一百數十件、南洋幫辦斜紋色布一百餘件、昨有疋頭一百十件運烟台、</p>
<p>東布　昨隨紗市續降，白貨細布跌一角半至二角、龍頭棧單收盤五十一元、細斜比較穩定、無甚榮辱、嗶嘰一元五角三分二厘半、而下月份期貨仍堅挺、同行做開須一元五角七分半、</p>
<p>防雨布銷路進展</p>
<p>昨呢羢市氣仍　、各種貨價、除派力司外、依然堅穩、而交易則已由躉批而轉爲零星、同業中吸收驟减、因呢羢界多爲甬人、自鎮·慈·甬奉·發生戰事後、俱感不安、祇防雨布尙有成交、金熊老牌需要　殷、昨市聞共開出三四千碼、半數由友生廠直接拋交、半數由大批發戶所銷售、每碼計價爲四元五角、</p>
<h3>糖市　期粗白回升</h3>
<p>昨糖市初漲後鬆、結果略回漲、公會划盤、現貨二四組白爲九十九元八角至五角、升三角、期貨叫月底打單初爲九十九元半、旋升至一百零二元、收盤爲一百兀〇〇五分、升一元三角、五月十日打單初　至一百〇三元、四兀、後以百〇一元九角收盤、升一元二角、荷赤續鬆爲七十九元至七十八元半、小一元、太古車白B嘜東棧一百〇五元半至五元、DY嘜西棧九、九元、HM嘜八十七元、無甚軒輊、國糖陳刁靑昨以六十八元開出二百六十八包、係本廠辦去、以作冰花靑之原料云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　川榨菜斷檔　代替品在製造中</h3>
<p>四川榨菜因來源困難、久無到貨、市存早巳吿乏、查斷檔前、最高零星售價曾到三百六七十元、較最低價爲四十與一之比、可謂空前新紀錄、本市專做榨菜者有鑒及此、故會試製數百　、係以彌陀菜（即瘤芥菜）爲原料、茲當素食不久上市、一俟成熟、即將出以承乏、惟聞貨質　遜云、</p>
<h3>雜項　固本皂價　將近半元一塊</h3>
<p>日常用品如肥皂買價、日趨高升、廠方因硝碱等原料成本浩大、囤戶仍把持此拉彼抬、市價如脫繮之馬、疾馳難制、昨市做開如固本皂每箱巳至五十五元五角、價格過高、無論其實地如何、銷路終將爲他皂所奪、白祥茂皂每箱四十八元、黃祥茂皂每箱四十一元五角、箭刀皂每箱四十二元、均較略升外、觀市氣異常堅固、故價實難回小、日用品如此高貴、一般平民實有不勝負担之苦、</p>
<h3>戰時歐洲鑽石業的命運</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>（一）鑽石業的回顧</p>
<p>琢磨鑽石這種技術，是於公元十五世紀時，產生在比利時的盎維爾期（Anvers）城。此後逐漸進步，到十九世紀的末期，發達至於頂點；且也是因爲這時有那著名南非洲脫蘭士哇大鑽石礦的開發，能供給大批原料的緣故。多少年來，鑽石不過當貴埃的點綴品，這時中產階級也得在戒指耳環上邊，嵌鑲一小塊光耀人眼的鑽石，它的價值已不是往日的可望而不司攀！</p>
<p>在第一决歐戰前世界上的長期繁榮，使鑽石業得到一個非常活躍的季節，它擁有些特選的顧主，財源豐富的帝俄是比國盎維爾期與符蘭阿姆斯持丹兩大城鑽石的絕好出路；豪富如神話中人物的印度王子，也儘量滿足他們的寶石慾，然而爲鑽石商的頭等顧客，能吸收他們貨色十分之九的，除了金圓的美國又有誰呢？拿美國購貨的數目字說吧，公元一九零九元，輸入美國的鑽石，價值一七，三六九，四○五圓。上决歐戰時，當然减少，所以一九一八年爲八，二六四，〇二一圓。凡爾　和的一訂，父立刻抬頭，在一九一九年就昇到六四，二二二，九四七圓。此後一直到世界經濟大恐慌以前，輸人的價值水準，常是保持着戰前的二倍。譬如一九一九年吧，統計數字上還表現着四千二百萬元呢，可是到一九三〇年竟慘落到二千三百萬圓，以後四年，情形更壞，接着三年，稍有轉機，想不到一九三八那一年竟銳减到一七，〇一六，〇二四圓，開太平時期未有的先例。</p>
<p>（二）戰時的景况</p>
<p>美國這種購買力的急劇减削，當然給鑽石業中心的城市像盎維爾斯和阿姆斯丹一種無情的重大打擊，一時那些恃此爲生的掮客，琢磨工人等等，大形紛擾，汲汲惶惶頗有不可終日的情勢。世界上任何其他工業，也不能像它對於各國經濟恐慌和備戰的緊張空氣，具有那麼靈敏的感應性！不過這種風波，不久，就平靜下去，而且最令人奇怪的，是在一九三九年九月，歐戰爆發的最初，鑽石的交易大有好轉的趨勢，那時從美洲來了極大的一批定貨單，特別是質量機小的鑽石，以致這種貨品的價格立刻上漲百分之二十到二十五。爲什麼戰爭爆發鑽石的去路倒反好了呢？這不能不稍一思及上决歐戰的情形，上决歐戰時，倚蘭嚴守中立，成了交戰國鑽石的最大最重要的顧客，事後獲利很有可觀。現在那擁有最大財富的美國，自然也想把老文章照抄一下，把它那過剩的資金買點珍寶和鑽石玩玩。旁的人看見美國人這樣做，他們也轉動腦筋，緊跟着效起顰來，於是鑽石的銷路立刻大見活躍。</p>
<p>不過比國鑽石工業協會在所出月刋」上，警吿人不要過於樂觀了，它以爲現在這一决戰爭同一九一叫年的，絕沒有可以比擬的地方，從則是經過</p>
<p>個長期繁榮的時期，銷路遠比現在爲廣，購買力也遠較現在爲大，况說那時的貨幣制度，遠陵現在爲簡……。它的理解，佔了上風，定購鑽石的趨勢，沒有以前那麼踴躍了，一九三九年的末期在平靜中過去。</p>
<p>雖然如此，現在一般人的理想，還以爲鑽石是寄託財富的一種很有利的方法，它的質量輕小，携帶便利，逃難　出奔外國，均不致有所妨碍，故一般的鑽石收藏家，根據這種心理，誰也不肯把自己的鑽石調換那價值並無一定的鈔票或公債票，不過他們也有一種顧慮，就是恐怕鑽石的價值跌落，爲的預防這種事情發生，他們是有一種極縝密的組織和計劃，英國有一個叫De　Beers的鑽石公司，從鑛中採取出來的牛鑽石幾乎完全被它統制，它在倫敦有一個總出售機關，名叫鑽石同業公所：是從這裏把牛鑽石分發到一總的鑽石中心城市去。這些機關，仗着自己豐厚的資財，和給那些鑽石生產家所訂的合同，能够把一總的鑽石屯集起來，然後慢慢的少量的望外拋售，這樣，它的價值就不會被人搖動了。</p>
<p>（三）所謂工業鑽石</p>
<p>鑽石不但用以爲裝飾品而巳，有所謂「不中程」的鑽石，（就是不能琢磨成珍飾品的），它在工業上的用途，允其在五花八門，日新月異，譬如我們所以稱它為「鑽」石的，就是因爲它那無與倫比的硬度，能鑽透任何其他物品，能有鑽的利用的緣故，鑽探煤礦，煤油井，溫泉或仟何種礦等所用的那機器，頭上是帶着價石作成的帽子，壓碾無論多麼粗細的金屬絲機器，也是鑽石作成的，汽車或飛機的製造，離了極硬的金屬或鑽石作成的　器，根本是沒法進行，解石工業上所用的那直徑兩公尺長的大鋸，在鋸齒上共鑲嵌着一百五十多個鑽石！至於玻璃業上，鐘表業上，或膠木業上，……鑽石全有它不可泯减的功續和地位！何况鑽石在工業上的用　，也不過方鑽萌芽而巳，將來的發揚光大，更是難以限量的呢。　（未完）</p>
<h3>罌粟（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>而且當時印度洋南洋羣島和中國沿海的商業覇權，是握於阿刺伯人手中的：這種等麗的能「散萬里客愁」的米囊花，也因爲達食商人和中國通商頻繁的緣故，隨着他們的足跡遠涉重洋的登了中國的大陸。這是在公元八世紀的末期，當唐德宗貞元年間的事。這罌粟的輸入中國，不過因為它能夠「止瀉痢，固脫肛，……止心腹筋骨諸痛（李時琛本草綱目）」罷了，誰想到有如許妙用的靈藥，將來竟會變成叫人傾家蕩產，「此與殺人兇器等，不名烟袋故名槍」的劇烈毒物呢？用之不臧，遺禍無窮是人爲的過錯，又怎好　罪於東西的本身？</p>
<p>雅片一名，係從拉丁文Opinm字譯出，李時琛在本草綱目上標作「阿片」，下邊註說俗名「雅片」。阿芙蓉係從阿刺伯語Afion一字而來，李時琛也說：「阿芙蓉前代罕聞，近方有用者，云是……花之津液也。」然而李時琛也只是說到雅片能止痢，固陽，如同所附一粒金丹諸方，全是呑服而用的，還絕未提到用烟斗烟槍吸食的痕迹呢！所以雅片的吸食，實起於明朝的末年；至於係什麼人作的備？是中國人自創的抑係傳自外洋？均有些渺茫難考了。據日人稻葉君山作的淸朝全史說：「製成近代形狀之雅片，不過四百年，實由中國造成之。……他國人之服用雅片，概入之於口送之於胃，中國人獨小然，以烟草吸用法爲媒介。」不過要以前邊所引佛經看來，吸食的法子也頗有從外方傳來的可能；究竟怎樣，現在還不能　下定語呢。</p>

<h3>反對扣留南國商船　日當局提抗議　謂不贊成歐戰延及遠東　刻仍談判可望和平解決　駐日義使館武官將來滬</h3>
<p>泰唔士報云、日海軍發言入昨日（二十五日）下午在招待新聞記者席上透露、日海軍司令島田繁太郎對於星期二（二十二日）義水兵扣留南斯拉夫貨船東尼期拉夫號一事、已向此間義大利海軍當局提出抗議、但迄至昨晚、尙永接得義當局之答覆、</p>
<p>日發言人　聲明二點</p>
<p>據該發言人表示、此事不久將有和半解決之希望、惟渠官稱、此事有二點應特別重視、（一）就歐戰而言、上海爲中立區、（二）日本政府始終保守反對歐戰延及遠東之政策、該發言人史就第一點說明東尼斯拉夫號貨船所泊之水面、係在日　之佔領區內、並非目下歐戰中交戰國領土之一部份、關於第二點、該發言人又稱、日海軍當局根據日本政府之政策、務使關於歐戰之糾紛、勿延及日本控制下之遠東水面、渠並指出、義大利水兵武裝駐守該輪一事、與日政府之政策、並不相合、</p>
<p>港務當局　堅持立塲</p>
<p>聞江海關港務局職員與義大利當局、刻仍在進行談判中、同時該被扣南輪上之義水兵、亦仍未撒去、至於江海關港務局與義當局所進行之談判詳情如何、則尙無從獲悉、但一般預料、談判進行、甚爲滿意、因江海關港務當局、刻正堅持立塲、據理力爭、並指義方此舉爲破壞中立之行動、故此事數日內當可完全解決、</p>
<p>英方密切　注意發展</p>
<p>同時、此間英當局對於此案甚爲注意、蓋因東尼斯拉夫號貨船、係租與澳洲小麥管理部者、又因南斯拉夫與英國爲戰時同盟國之故也、但英領事並未提出抗議僅密切注意其發展而已、此種態度、可使義水兵之撤退、不</p>
<p>有傷體面、又據英文大美晚報消息、義總領事曼立都會於昨日造訪日總領事崛內、討論關於　貨輪被扣之事、</p>
<p>義國軍官　啓程來滬</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、此間日當局對義兵攫佔南國貨船湯密斯拉夫號事、巳提出交涉、一般人乃料義兵即將撤離該船、但迄今止、義兵仍駐該船守衛」、聞駐滬義總領事梅里托今晨曾訪會日總領事崛內、諒係繼續討論此事、又同盟社東京電傳、義國駐日大使館海軍武官浦萊利上校（義國駐遠東最高海軍軍官）今夜啟程來滬「視察」、浦氏此行或與攫佔湯密斯拉夫號事有關</p>

<p>每包成本　一百卅元</p>
<p>以上兩洋行富有業米經騐、但目前並不從事米糧營業、冉上項米糧到滬以後、每包成本折合國幣一百三十元左右、比目下市價、低廉廿餘元、深信由於此項港米運滬銷售以後、定可切實收效、壓平本市米價也、</p>

<h3>家庭與學校</h3>
<p>— 令</p>
<p>一般父母，把孩子送入了學校，於是八一切教導的責任，都交託在教師的手中，自己的孩子成績不好，品性低劣，都歸咎於教師的疏忽，那時一個多麼大的錯誤！</p>
<p>做家長的先得知道，學校可以使一個目不識丁的孩子，漸漸地由認識簡單的字體而能閱讀各種畫籍，寫作長篇論文，也可以使一個搖搖欲跌的孩子，鍜鍊成强健的體格，還可以使一個不懂人事的孩子，充滿了豐富的學識，更可以使一個事事需人幫助的孩子而有老練的辦事能力。可是在學生求學中，辦事中，行動中，處處顯出各人的不同，（除了智慧不同外）有的是高傲乖戾，有的是謙虛柔和，有的頑强，有的退縮，有的喜孤獨，有的好合羣，有的勤奮，有的懶惰，有的好俠義，有的很自私，有的暴跺，有的忍耐，學校裹雖然用故事法，集會法，演講法，表演法等各種方法，想來改變兒童的品性，但是儘管講着誠實在同學間仍有東西失竊，儘管提倡勤奮，派學生挨决做値日生，一個懶惰成性的兒童，或者在教師面前做得很好，回家後無論無事都不高興去做，像道樣前後矛盾的舉動，不知有多少事實可以舉例，所以品性的轉移，不是學校教育所能做到的。</p>
<p>兒童的品性爲什麼各人是不同的。爲什麼根深蒂固的不可改變。第一個問題可以依各兒童生長的家庭環境不同來回答，第二個問題，有幾個原因造成的，（一）兒童在家庭的時間多；一個五歲的兒童，在他踏進舉校以前，有五個年頭，在家庭上他接觸的是父母和姊妹兄弟，家中人的一舉一動，無論是好的壞的，他都要摹倣，甚至那一人對他最好最愛他，他也知道得很淸楚，母親溺愛他的，他會任意的放縱，要挾，其他不良的品性也因此養成，因爲時期的漫長，和生平開始的印象，就打了很牢的根基，以後進了學校，和家庭接觸的機會仍多，他的性格也不容易改變了。（二）教師工作繁忙，學生人多，教師不能顧及每一個兒童；教師除了在課文上加以教導外，其他如辦理校務，批改卷子，處置兒童的糾紛，再沒有精力能一個個的去勸化兒童，改革他們的劣根性。加以在課外很少和兒童接觸，所以沒有像家人之間有情感，以致兒童對於教師有敬畏之心，不敢加以接近，以爲教師喊到辦公室中，總是受責罰，並沒有自欲改善之心。</p>
<p>要謀學校教育收到偉大的成效，發揮極大的力量，一定要家庭和學校聯絡起來，打成一片，家長不要把責任推在教師的身上，從兒童出生後，就要負起教養兼施的職責，奠立良好品性和習慣的基礎，然後學校教育相輔相成，以期使每一個兒童健全的向各方面發育起來！將來足能擔當一切重大的任務。</p>
<h3>讀國文得到的一些經騐</h3>
<p>— 小讀者琴</p>
<p>小朋友：國文，是我國的文字，接觸的時期，當然要比別深多，就是常識也要從國文中變化，因此，讀國文給與我們的經騐也就要比別踝多。</p>
<p>然而我却沒有多大經騐，只是在無形中發覺非這樣讀不可，談到經騐，這就算是我的經騐了。</p>
<p>從壓决的騐試中，得到了幾點讀法。例如讀白話文，讀的語調就得像講話一樣，只要聽去明白，那麼自己當然能領會書中的大意與內容了：讀文言，不要像說話一樣，而要多讀，多讀了，自然能明瞭每一句的解釋。有一次，我讀一課要背的文言，初讀時，書中的句子莫明其妙，但讀到背出後，就能明白中間的解釋了。我自己也不知道怎麼能這樣，但實際的騐試却是這樣的。一</p>
<p>要背一課書，先得分段背出；然後全篇讀幾遍，也就容易背出了。（若遇過長的段落，自己再分讀），因爲分段的字句少，容易熱記，全篇讀幾遍，就能把分段的字句連絡，但最要緊的還是自己的注意力不可分散。</p>
<p>假如在讀書或閱書時，要深深地把書中所寫的事實現在眼前，要身入其境地去想像，當自己寫作時想一想是否與某篇之起與結能相同作法，這樣兩下相比，就能應用了。</p>
<h3>養蠶</h3>
<p>— 劍</p>
<p>淸明過去，養蠶的人家就開始養蠶了，靜兒看見同學養蠶很有趣，就向同學要了些蠶子預備自己親手來養養看，他從沒養過蠶，一點經騐也沒有，但是知道媽媽從前是飼養過的，於是很快的跑去問媽媽，媽媽說：「你要養蠶嗎？那麼你聽吧。」靜兒於是很用心的聽了。</p>
<p>蠶的飼養方法呢？就是先將蠶卵放在溫暖處，使蠶孵出蟻蠶，然後將羽毛從紙上輕輕的帶下，或者把紙反擊使蠶落下，就把桑葉切細給它吃，蠶沒慢地長大，在二三眠後可以餵以整葉，要一定的時間，不可長久停斷，須把桑渣與蠶糞除去，二三眠後應每日一决，到四眠後，蠶的身體透明，搖頭向上，即可上簇做繭子了。繭子不是很美麗嗎？顏色也很多，那繭子做好了，用火力把裹面的蛹洪死就可繅絲了。絲的用處眞多啦：普通做衣服重要的原料。靜兒聽完了問：「桑葉潮濕的可以嗎？」媽媽說：「不可以的，桑葉還須淸潔，不然對於蠶是有害處的。」靜兒聽得很仔細，於是很快樂的跑去工作了。</p>
<h3>下種的常識</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>阿慧的父親是挺喜歡化的一個。在戰前，故鄉的花園中種着不少的花紅紅綠綠，眞是燦爛極了。可是自避難到了上海之後，任在這樣狹小的屋子裏，種花的一回事當然置之腦後了。但有時乘星期日休假之便，時常帶着阿慧到公園裏去逛逛，有一天頓時引起了他父種種花的興趣。</p>
<p>現在正當春光明媚的時光，他父親在辦公完畢以後，忽然很高興的買了幾包花子回來，預備由自己來下種，這也引起了阿慧的奇心，倒底要瞧一瞧那花子是怎麼樣的？而且在包花子的袋上還印着五顏六色的花朶，好看得很，旁邊註明着那花的名稱，阿慧看了莫明其妙。到得他把花子袋拆開之後，向裏面一瞧，只見那些像芝蔴一樣的花子，「這些花子能發芽開花的嗎」！他這樣的去問他的父親。</p>
<p>「你看這些花的種子，好像死的一般，一些活力也沒有，其實不然，它也有呼吸作用，它和生氣蓬勃的花，甚至和我們都一樣的在呼吸，不過種子的呼吸是非常的慢。種子最好在現在散播，發芽也比較來得快」！</p>
<p>「爸爸，那麽種子爲什麽一定要在春天散布？能不能在冬季下種的呢」？阿慧連接的問着。</p>
<p>「要知道種子發芽，必須要有三個條件，一是水份，二是溫度，三是養氣。在冬天，溫度是不會到種子發芽時所需的溫度，所以在那時撒布下去的種子，當然不會出的。一定要等待春天到來，氣候漸漸地溫暖起來，泥土所含的水份，因溫暖的關係，也漸漸的蒸發，養氣因泥土裏水分蒸發出去，便容易進入到泥土裏面去。在泥土中的種子本來是有水份的，况且現在溫度量已經加高，養氣也有得供給種子的吸收，這三個條件在春天都已具備，所以容易發芽，我們在下種之前，必須把泥土弄鬆，然後把種子散布，吾則，在堅硬的泥土中，柔弱的幼芽怎麽能伸出泥土表面來呢？當種子散布以後，大的經過一星期左右，有的種子，便能發芽了，那時便可區別那種子是屬於那一門的植物？因爲植物大略可分爲雙子葉植物和單子葉植物所以在一發芽之後，便有最初的嫩葉片發生，那便叫子葉。如有兩片子葉，那種子的植物便可決定它是雙子葉植物，如果只有一片，便叫單子葉植物。」阿慧的父親在這裹停住了，便去把種子散布在花盆裹，在種子的上面薄薄的加了一層土，再澆了一些淸水，然後等待那種子的發芽了。</p>
<h3>藏着火的紙和包着風的紙</h3>
<p>— 端芳</p>
<p>星期日下午鶯兒明兒姊弟兩人的功課完畢後要求父親帶他們去看電影，父親笑着說：</p>
<p>「好是好的，不過我要你們每人去拿一件東西給我」。</p>
<p>明兒性急等不得父親說完就喊：「行！行！你快說拿什麽啊」？</p>
<p>爸爸先對鶯兒講：「你一張藏着火的紙給我」。</p>
<p>又跟明兒說：「你給我一張包着風的紙罷」。</p>
<p>可憐姊弟二人，被爸爸的話說呆了，你望我，我望你，一句話也說不出，後來到底是鶯兒心細，叉比較明兒大二歲，想了一會，就說：「有了！有了！」一面三步當兩步的跑進儲藏室，拿出一個新年時點的燈籠來，點亮了一根蠟燭送給爸爸去：</p>
<p>「這不是紙中藏火嗎」？鶯兒得意地說。</p>
<p>「不錯，今兒你有電影看了」。</p>
<p>這時明兒心裏更加着急，很快的流下兩滴眼淚來，父親見他哭了，才從抽屜裹拿出一把摺扇來對明兒說：</p>
<p>「這不是我叫你拿的東西嗎？扇子一扇，不是就生出風來了嗎？所以我吿訴你，往往一件極容易的事，外表看來的確難得很，但是祇要你用心一想，立刻就可以解決，哭是不會幫助你的，現在已經不早，我們一起去看電影吧」！</p>
<p>這樣，明兒才轉悲爲喜，並且從此以後，遇到困難的事，總要細細的想，再也不哭了。</p>
<h3>努力向上</h3>
<p>— 志誠</p>
<p>自從看了十三日，本刋上丁小姐的：「一個孤僻孩子的自白」後，我會流了許多淚。</p>
<p>我也歡喜靜，愛在夜半憑窗望月，默默的悲哀着。就是白天也是這樣的，呆呆的默坐在書桌前，不動，也不做功課糊裏糊塗的混過去。所以我在校中常受先生的責駡，在家中也受家人的輕視，但我仍好像不間不聞似的，一些不想努力向上。</p>
<p>但我自從看了丁小姐的文章後，見丁小姐那種英勇的態度，我有些慚愧，覺得我的怪脾氣的錯誤了。我是中華民國的主人翁，我將替中華民國出力，我將爲人類造福。中國甚至於世界是如此的需要我們這一批人呀！</p>
<p>於是我切實的努力起來了，每天做我應做的功課，每晚同大哥，二哥，小弟，一起做有益的體育遊戲，因爲「一個强健的頭腦需要一個强健的身子」，同時我也使自己常常快樂。</p>
<p>我知道有許多小朋友們，也正有着我以前這樣的舉動的，我也希望這些小朋友們在看到我這篇文字後，會很快的學我做起來，（雖然我這些動作不一定十全十美）如果我的希望能成事實的話，那麽我們能在不久的將來看到自己學業上的進步了。</p>

<h3>「香箋淚」主角　蓓蒂黛維絲和三導演</h3>
<p>— 肇基</p>
<p>在電影雜誌Oregonian上，最近刊載了一篇蓓蒂黛維絲的訪問記，記者們逼着她要說些關於演技方而的話，因爲有人造謠中傷蓓蒂，說她的演技大大地退步了。蓓蒂黛絲倒是挺俏皮的，她說：「我無論何時在想使自己的演技史進一步，我生平崇拜影城中三個名導演，我看到他們導演的片子中演員的演技就可以增進我的一方面。」</p>
<p>原來這位銀幕上的「苦」朋星蓓蒂黛維絲所崇拜的名導演便是的翰福特，威廉蒂德爾和愛德門高亭三人。約翰福特曾導演「革命叛徒」，「暴風刦」，「少年林肯」，「怒火之花」，「水深火熱」，（該片上海尙未公映）等巨片，他曾兩度獲最佳導演金像獎。威廉蒂德爾是好萊塢傳記片導演怪傑，如「慾海慈航」，「路透傳」和以前的「左拉傳」，「萬古流芳」等都是。愛德門高亭是好萊塢苦片子導演怪傑，如「卿何薄命」，「畏相思」，「人海寃魂」以及「天上人間」等都是。蓓蒂黛維絲在以前主演苦片子時總是請他來導演的。</p>
<p>以上三個，導演是蓓蒂所最崇拜的，因爲凡是在他們三人負責指導下，演　很能發揮其特性，並且能得益處</p>
<p>「福特對於氣氛抓得很緊，觀衆常是看得透不過氣來，並且片子的內容很有意義，主演福特導演的片子是很吃車的。</p>
<p>「蒂德爾導演的傳記片中，主演的人很　發揮演技。他是斵輪老手，演員能得到演技上的進步。</p>
<p>「高亭對於悲劇音調很是注意，演員便應當配合了這步驟與動作，所以常能得到他的指示。」</p>
<p>以上便是蓓蒂黛維絲所以崇拜這三位大導演的理由，所以看到她能在好導演力面去求教學習便可以知道她在如何想使自己演技進步的急切了，</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲最　　記者們說：「請你們去看了「香箋淚」和「西渥地新娘」（Bride　Came　from　C·O·D·）兩片後再來證實我本人吧，我也很誠懇地希望得到旁人的指教。」</p>
<p>蓓蒂曾因主演「女人女人」及「紅杉淚痕」而兩度獲金像獎。她的演技之精湛深刻確已久炙人口，上海方面即將映其近作「香箋淚」了，影迷們可以去判斷她的演技有沒有比從前退步呢？</p>
<h3>談連環套</h3>
<p>— 陳永錫</p>
<p>連環套一劇，爲近年南北劇壇叫座戲之一，其劇情爲英雄會上，黃三太實爾墩反臉動武，時三太年已衰老，竇則血氣方剛，故三太小敵而暗放飛鏢，竇傷後，羞憤萬分，匿跡於連環套，誓報一鏢之仇，隔數十年後，適康熙賜一名馬與梁九公，竇遂盜馬以陷三太，時三太已去世，乃責犬霸（三太子）承其罪，天霸無奈，與同僚朱光祖計全關太何路通扮作鏢客模樣，往各處探訪，道過連環套，頭目出刦，天霸擒而釋之，反往拜山，得悉御　確在寨中，因亦言明彼即三太後人，竇不持人多，乃送出寨外，的定决日山下比武。是夜，朱光祖混入寨內，假天霸名盜鈎挿刀，决日比武時，光祖責以大義，竇感焉，因獻御馬到官領罪，天霸力保免扎死，後實遂皈依佛鬥。是劇以武生（黃天霸）花臉（賚爾墩）爲中，武丑（朱光祖）爲賓，北方天霜一角，白楊小樓故後，後　得數周　中高盛麟劉宗揚李萬春吳彥衡　，其中宗揚曾得揚之親炙，故其，笑，頗得楊味；又此天霜一角，間亦有老生串演者，馬連良初决抵滬時，曾演是角。今則貫盛習葉世長亦嘗演之，竇爾墩一脚色，當年與楊配者爲郝壽臣，郝體矮胖，惟以狠勁超人一等耳。講身段神情，則首推侯喜瑞，金少山惟以氣魄嗓音勝，季春恒劉硯亭亦不弱，後輩袁世海先仿侯後宗郝，兼之幼功有根基，故演此絕佳，裘盛戎除鼻音討厭外尙可一觀，朱光祖自王長林傳小山歿後，葉盛章武工柔術雖冠於　輩，然滿嘴拌豆腐，精彩减少不少，王福山爲長林子，然依老賣老，尙不及艾世菊。南方絕鮮演此劇，蓋南方武生有嗓耐唱者不多，且無有　好之花臉；卡爾登麒麟童（飾黃天霸）高百歲（飾竇爾墩）曾演此，然屬反串性質。黃金程少餘之寶爾墩，多用炸音，惟苗勝春飾朱先祖，除武工外，神氣白口皆佳，張德祿雖工武生，喜串演武丑，故亦能演是角。趙如泉演連環套，前天霸後必光祖，近胡鬧矣。</p>
<h3>滬社票房公演</h3>
<p>滬社票房今日爲成立一週紀念日，除出特刊外並於上午十時，在跑馬廳七十九號該社招待各界。下午一時起在寗波同鄉會舉行公演，夜塲有唐如堯張博仁兩君主演之連環套，及張文安張瑞鴻　君之全部漁夫恨等云。</p>
<h3>紀念西苓</h3>
<p>— 吳琛</p>
<p>沈西苓先生的逝世是在苦難新生中中國藝術的一個損失，無論與沈先生識與不識，都會這樣想。因而，我們對這一位　靭苦幹的藝人之死表示一點哀思，一點追悼，是「應母庸議」的事。</p>
<p>論私誼，西苓先生和我沒有什麼深的來往。祇見過幾　，記得有一决是在他令姊　　先生的辦公室裏，因爲彼此都忙，也沒有做過　長的談話，這是至今引爲遺憾的。在公誼說，我欽佩他的戰鬥精神，同情他的戰鬥環境，而憐惜他的戰鬥方法。在中國的　壇上，是有着許多「坐享其成」或能獲得「事半功倍」的聰敏藝術家的。但在西苓光生，却是相反，他所獲得的「效果」，沒有一點不是化了他三倍四倍甚致於十倍的血，汗，勞力的。有人說他「軟弱」，這樣似乎是「同情」而實際上是「得意」與「譏諷」的批評。</p>
<p>將西苓先生的代表作「十字街頭」改編的舞臺劇公演作爲紀念他的力法之一種，我是深表讚同的。這工作由對西苓有深切的友誼與瞭解，對劇藝有精湛的修養與經騐的魯思先生來做，也是最適宜沒有的事。可怪的是這導演的責任，竟會落在我的肩上，不撒謊，在我是意外而又是痛苦的工作。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」之所以能獲得成功，並不是偶然的事，眞正的藝術，是不會有「徼倖」的，原作是總和了嚴肅的主題，輕鬆的演出，剪接與導演手法的活潑，加上了精湛的演技才形成了這一部中國藝壇稀有的佳片。如果我們沒有西苓先生道種苦幹的精神，認眞的態度，和相當的把握而來談紀念沈西苓先生，這不僅是侮辱了西苓先生，也是侮辱了我自已。</p>
<p>某於此，當天風當局要我導演「十字街頭」，於有不得不接受的情勢下接受下來後，我總像自己在做着一件犯罪的行爲，我覺得我是在拿着一柄利刃把沈西苓先生的心血毅力結晶成的榮譽衣冠支解得粉碎。我白天想着，晚間夢着的是怎樣方可以减輕些我的罪愆，如何方能少傷害些西苓先生的衣冠。在無可奈何的境况裏，我祇能希望「排練，排練，再排練！」</p>
<p>感謝許多熱情的靑年觀衆，他們對這决演出都抱着莫大的希望。更有許多來信囑我不要損害了原作的精神。每一句可囑，像一根一根針扎在我的身上，使我汗涔涔下了。</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第七章　攻城殺將何紛紛</p>
<p>李信把刀指着方胖子駡道：「你這賊奴才，我平日待你不薄，即使小有呵責，你也不應記恨在心，前天受傷，也是你自己不好。竟敢在杞縣令面前誣吿我通匪盜，害我下獄，父逼死我的妻子，傷天害理，狗　小若。你這奴才，畜生小如，還有人心嗎？我倒要看看你的心黑到怎樣程度呢？」舉起扑刀，直刺入方胖子的心坎，只一攪，已把一顆心血淋淋地剜了出來。桂秋駭得雙手掩面，跟着倒下地去。李信瞧着伊駡道：「你這淫賤人，我也饒你不得」。白刃一揮，桂秋也早身首異處了。紅娘子在旁見李信已處置了那一雙狗男女，遂說道：「你夫人已死，家財已盡，再沒有可留戀了，快跟我回靑石山去吧，免得官兵追踪至此。」李信點點頭，長嘆一聲，回身和紅娘子走下樓來，步出莊門，又向自己莊院相視了一回，只是太息。靑石山的兒郎早已牽過坐騎，紅娘子首先跳上伊的紅鬃馬，李信也祇得跟着跨上坐馬，和紅娘子等一行人離了杞縣，望靑石山去。李信舊地　臨，眞是他萬萬想不到的，心裏父感傷，又驚喜。佟天豹早已回轉，接着李信上山，便命廚房裏排上酒肴，爲李信洗塵，兄妹二人陪着他同坐。李信想起前日私　的事，十分慚愧，舉着酒杯，向佟氏兄妹致謝道：「李信因思鄕心切，前日從山上不別而行，回至杞縣，不幸爲小人陷害，狗官挾嫌誣栽，身受囹　之厄，幾死賊子之手。多蒙賢兄妹仗義相救，此恩此德，眞可謂生死人而肉白骨。此番直上山寨，祇覺惶愧萬分呢。」佟天豹道：「李爺不要這般說，祇要你鑒於我妹妹的一片眞心和熱忱，不再三心兩意，安居在此，共圖大業，那就是我兄妹倆的大幸了。」紅娘子却不說話，默默然祇把一雙水在在地妖媚的眼睛向李信緊看。李信內心自疚，覺得自己的行徑非常對不起伊的。遂說道：「荷蒙賢兄妹不棄，自當追隨骥尾，共同戮力。」佟天豹說聲「好」。舉起大觥來狂飲。又談談杞縣的情形，以及天下大勢，方纔散席。晚上佟天豹　送李信到他妹妹房中去。李信到了這地方，足將進而趦趄，口將言二囁嚅。華燈影裏見紅娘子穿着茜色睡衣，背燈而坐，體態輕盈，萬孌萬方，一些沒有勇悍之氣。（四九）</p>

<h3>Sino-American Economic Cooperation: Equalization Fund Agreement Signed; Joint Statement by Morgenthau, Sung, and Soong; Jointly Stabilizing Currency and Maintaining Mutual Freedom</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States and Great Britain both provided economic aid to China yesterday. Both countries have signed agreements with China to stabilize the Chinese currency. The two countries have allocated $90 million USD to China's disposal. Officials also announced that the National Bank of China will increase the amount by $20 million USD, bringing the total of China's equalization fund to $110 million USD, some of which will be in British pounds. People here believe that this fund is actually a kind of defense fund, because both the United States and Great Britain have announced the establishment of such agreements, which are an expression of the friendly relations between the United States and China, and between Great Britain and China. The US communique also recognizes this agreement as a cooperation agreement between two friendly countries, intended to cooperate with each other in planting methods to maintain each other's freedom. The first agreement was signed by US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and two representatives of China: Soong, Director of the Bank of China, and Li Gan, an official of the Central Bank. This agreement stipulates that the US Treasury Department will purchase Chinese currency worth $50 million USD. The second agreement was signed by British Treasury Secretary Phillips and Soong, stipulating that the British Treasury Department, in addition to the £5 million already provided in 1939, will provide another £5 million to prevent fluctuations in the price of Chinese currency. The total amount of these two items totals $40 million USD. This fund provided by the United States and Great Britain will be managed by the Chinese Equalization Fund Committee. In addition to three Chinese members, there will be one member each from the United States and Great Britain. In addition to the above-mentioned funds, the National Bank of China will also provide $20 million USD and $50 million USD for joint use. Therefore, including the funds provided by the United Kingdom, the total amount of funds available to the Chinese Equalization Fund Committee has reached $110 million USD. The provision of funds by the United States and Great Britain was announced by the governments of the two countries in 1940, but it was not officially concluded until yesterday. Insiders here said that the signing of the Sino-American Equalization Agreement at this time is largely intended to counteract any psychological reactions unfavorable to China after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty. The signing ceremony was held in Morgenthau's office. The ceremony was very simple. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih was also present, but did not participate in the signing, because this matter is a financial matter of the financial institutions of the two countries. However, Dr. Hu Shih said that he was very impressed by this matter, and also said that the success of this matter was largely due to the efforts of Mr. Soong. As for Mr. Soong, he did not make any special remarks, but said that everything he wanted was already in the communique he and Morgenthau had issued. Mr. Soong also answered some questions, saying that he would still stay in the United States for some time to handle other Chinese affairs and purchase supplies for the Chinese government. The British Ambassador to the United States also issued a communique on the signing of this agreement, stating that this agreement makes Sino-British monetary cooperation an important step forward, and symbolizes the friendly relations between the two countries. The remaining remarks in the British communique are the same as those in the Sino-American joint communique. As for the joint communique issued by Morgenthau and Soong, it stated that the signing of the Equalization Fund Agreement between China and the United States has made monetary cooperation between the two countries an important step forward. This cooperation agreement is for two friendly countries to cooperate in various ways to maintain each other's basic freedom. In addition to the obvious purpose of maintaining the stability of each other's currency relations, this agreement is also an important factor in promoting the welfare of the two countries. In addition, China has also reached an agreement with the British Treasury Department, under which the United Kingdom will provide another £5 million in addition to the Sino-British Equalization Fund already established in 1939. These funds will be managed by a five-member committee, consisting of three Chinese members and one member each from the United Kingdom and the United States. The American member will be recommended by the US Treasury Secretary and then appointed by China. The British member will be recommended by the British Treasury Department and then appointed by China. The British Embassy here recalled that the United Kingdom provided a fund of £5 million in 1939, and last December the United Kingdom decided to provide another £5 million. Technical negotiations on this matter have been underway for some time, and the agreement was finally signed at 5:00 PM on the 25th (5:00 AM on the 26th Shanghai time).</p>
<p>Enhancing Foreign Exchange Rates; People in the Provisional Capital Excited</p>
<p>Chongqing - Authoritative figures in financial circles recently commented on the signing of the Equalization Fund Agreement, saying that the negotiations on the Equalization Fund Agreement started in early December last year and have lasted for five months. The Sino-British and Sino-American Equalization Fund Agreements were both signed in Washington yesterday, and the stipulated terms will be implemented immediately. We are very excited to hear this news, which will be of great help to enhancing our foreign exchange rates and stabilizing prices. The significance is self-evident. In recent years, the United States has made several loans to China, the nature of which has always been within the scope of economics, but they are closely related to international politics and the United States' basic policy towards the Far East. For example, in late September last year, the Axis powers announced the establishment of an alliance, which shook the Far East. The day after the alliance was established, the United States officially announced a $25 million USD loan to China. At the end of November, the US Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives Coinage Committee unanimously passed the government's decision to lend $100 million USD to China. At that time, even when Britain was struggling on its own, it announced that it would lend £10 million to China, which was the beginning of the two countries adopting parallel policies to aid China. On the 13th of this month, after the Soviet Union and Japan reached a compromise, when the Japanese were triumphant, President Roosevelt first issued a statement expanding aid to China in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, and then the signing of this agreement was accelerated. The determination of the United States and Great Britain to step up aid to China, defend democracy, and save freedom can be seen at a glance. We know that we are fighting to defend democracy and freedom. The basic positions of China, Great Britain, and the United States have become consistent. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Political figures here recently learned of the signing of the Equalization Fund Agreement between China, the United States, and Great Britain. These people generally believe that this agreement is an effective aid to China from Great Britain and the United States, and is also a partial response to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty. Authoritative sources said that the Chinese members of the Chinese Equalization Fund Committee will be Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the International Trade Committee, Bei Zuyi, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and Xi Demao (transliteration), Chief of the Business Department of the Central Bank. The British member may be Rogers, a member of the Sino-British Equalization Fund Committee, and the American member may be Young, an American advisor to the Treasury Department.

<h3>Resisting Dictatorship; Never Retreating; US President Criticizes Lindbergh</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday sternly criticized Colonel Lindbergh, saying that Lindbergh and another group of people who firmly believe that the Axis powers will win a great victory only represent a small part of the American people's psychology. These people are like some people during the American Revolutionary War when the military suffered repeated defeats and the future was bleak, who advised Washington to seek peace, and the same was true during the Civil War. I myself and the majority of the American people are determined to fight to defend democracy and the democratic way of life, and to resist autocratic tyrants. I myself and the American people will never retreat because of the superiority of other countries' military forces. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Announces; US Expands Patrol Range; Will Extend to All Oceans Worldwide If Necessary; Rumor that Axis Forces Have Invaded Greenland; US Seeks Facts and Will Expel Them</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the United States' neutrality patrol area has been expanded and will be expanded to the world's oceans if necessary to defend the Western Hemisphere. At the same time, President Roosevelt said that Greenland Island may now be partially occupied by Axis forces. The United States is currently taking measures against the Axis presence there, but he said that he has not yet been able to determine whether Axis forces have already arrived in Greenland Island. The President also said that the United States is currently providing aid to Greece and will continue to provide aid to Greece regardless of the "temporary outcome" of the war. When asked whether the expansion of the neutrality patrol would create a "safe sea lane" to Greenland Island, the President replied that he hopes that the passage to Greenland Island can be kept safe and that there will be no more acts of aggression on the island. President Roosevelt went on to say that he believes that Axis forces may have invaded Greenland Island. He said he believes that the Axis powers' intentions on the island are not a fifth column, implying a more direct action than a fifth column (or armed forces). (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt hinted yesterday that if Axis forces are present on Greenland Island, the United States will take action to expel them from the island. The German Embassy here said that there is no news about the Axis powers' occupation of Greenland Island. Observers mostly speculate on President Roosevelt's intentions, that is, the United States is seeking to determine the facts about the alleged occupation and to expel the invaders. President Roosevelt directly denied that the government had any intention of establishing convoys, and said that the US Navy's actions in the Atlantic have been patrolling for the past year and a half, and that the current actions are still patrols. A news reporter said that this kind of patrol is actually what is called convoying, to create a safe passage for ships to sail. President Roosevelt replied that we cannot call a cow a horse, and a cow cannot become a horse. President Roosevelt specifically announced that the new policy of expanding ocean patrols does not cause the Panama security zone to be modified, it is only an expansion of the area of neutrality patrols. President Roosevelt emphasized that the patrol policy can be expanded when necessary to defend the Western Hemisphere. He said that patrols are not limited to the Western Ocean, and can be expanded to any part of the world's oceans when deemed necessary in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt also stated at a press conference yesterday that US neutrality patrol ships will sail into the seven seas in accordance with the needs of the Western Hemisphere's defense. The United States has no intention of escorting merchant ships at this time. The President declined to participate in a special discussion that could expand his views on convoying, but said that for a year and a half, US neutrality patrol ships have been traveling in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast as far as a thousand miles, and the patrol area of Maryland has been expanded and will be expanded at any time. This kind of patrol is not convoying, because convoying escorts merchant ships to avoid aggression, while patrolling is to conduct reconnaissance in a certain area to prevent any aggressive ships from entering the Western Hemisphere. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives Merchant Marine Committee has approved a bill authorizing the President to commandeer foreign ships idled in American ports. It is said that the wording of this bill simply allows these foreign ships to be transferred to Britain when Britain needs them. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced a policy yesterday that he would expand the United States' neutrality patrol, rather than establish a convoy system, to help transport military supplies to Britain and other democracies. Authorities here believe that President Roosevelt's policy is in accordance with international law. Authorities also believe that this policy does not violate the United States' neutral status, but point out that the full effect of this policy cannot be obvious until patrol warships encounter aggressive warships. The impression is that if the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance on a larger sea surface can be used to provide more detailed information, it will be of great indirect help to Britain. It is believed here that President Roosevelt's support for expanding patrols rather than the convoy system is a natural result of changes in naval tactics, because the convoy system established during World War I is no longer suitable for the current situation. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>China Has Military Importance in the Pacific; Has Prevented Japanese Attempts to Attack Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Sydney - Lower House Member and Labor Party representative to the War Advisory Council, Bisley, declared today that when the military conference issued a warning to Australia on February 12, the Japanese army was preparing to attack and seize Hong Kong. The Japanese plan was to occupy one side of Hong Kong with 20,000 men, while the Japanese fleet based on Hainan Island would be cruising on the other side of Hong Kong. But fortunately, the Chinese army's attack prevented the Japanese plan from being realized. Bisley stressed that China has great military importance in the Pacific, and said that the Japanese army has one million men and 300 warships engaged in the war against China. After the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, Japan may be able to transfer some of its troops for use elsewhere. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Most People Believe; America Will Be Drawn Into the War</h3>
<p>New York - According to the Gallup poll conducted from April 10 to 20, 82 percent of the American people now believe that America will be drawn into the war. Five months ago, this number was only 59 percent. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>America's Tense Diplomacy</h3>
<p>With the military progress of the Axis powers in the Balkans, and Japan's eagerness to try out the South Pacific after signing the treaty with the Soviet Union, the Washington government, which has made the victory of the democratic countries its national policy, has not only not flinched or softened in the slightest, but has instead redoubled its efforts to promote a more active and blatant anti-aggression policy.</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East, the Sino-American Equalization Fund Agreement was officially signed the day before yesterday (at the same time, the Sino-British agreement was also signed in Washington). This is not only the most practical step for the United States to support Chinese legal tender, but also a powerful weapon to help China continue to fight and defeat Japan; Before the signing of this agreement, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull had both clearly announced: "The United States has decided to immediately provide China with concrete assistance. The list of military supplies needed by China has been analyzed and considered in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act, and some of them have been approved for shipment to China." If we add the visit to China by President Roosevelt's eldest son, the US government's investment in helping to repair the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and the news from Tokyo yesterday that the US fleet is taking over Singapore, and that Admiral Hurd, commander of the US Asian Fleet, is about to go to Singapore to negotiate a "Six-Nation Military Treaty" with the British authorities, it can be seen that in the Far East, the United States is not only determined to provide large-scale assistance to China to contain Japan, but is also preparing to deal with the Japanese warlords with strength if they take advantage of the Axis offensive and Britain has no time to look east, and moves aggressively towards Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Regarding Europe, due to the near end of the Balkan war, Hitler's claws are gradually extending to the Atlantic Ocean and the western Mediterranean, and Britain's situation seems to have aroused special concern from the United States. Among them, the fact that American weapons shipped to Britain were sunk at sea by the Germans is the most worrying thing for the American authorities. According to foreign reports from the day before yesterday, the US Congress has learned that as much as 40 percent of the American supplies shipped to Britain have been sunk by Germany in the North Atlantic; If this news is true, it is indeed a hidden danger for Britain at the moment. No wonder US Secretary of the Navy Knox wants to loudly appeal, saying: "The United States must find a way to ensure that American aid to Britain can reach its destination; Things have come to this point, we cannot retreat, we must have a beginning and an end; If Britain fails, the United States may be completely surrounded (implying that Japan will also take the opportunity to attack British and American territories in the Far East), so if we cannot find or implement a method that allows Britain to win independently without our participation in the war, the result will be that we will eventually go to war;" Secretary of State Hull put it more bluntly, saying that "for the sake of the security of the Western Hemisphere and our own country, the United States must resist in the most suitable place for resistance;" In addition, after President Roosevelt convened a "War Cabinet" for consultation, there were widespread rumors that the United States would send warships to escort weapons to Britain, and yesterday Roosevelt clearly announced that the current American "neutrality patrol method" is expanding its scope, and when necessary, it should be expanded to the world's oceans to defend the Western Hemisphere; From this, it can be seen that if the above-mentioned situation of the loss of American goods shipped to Britain is true, then in the future, even if the Washington government does not immediately implement the method of sending ships to escort them, it should at least expand the current patrol system to ensure that cargo ships bound for Britain can safely arrive at the British mainland; Judging from what Roosevelt talked about yesterday, hoping to create a safe sea lane to Greenland, it can be seen that the Washington authorities are currently exhausting their efforts and going all out for this matter, and it is believed that there will be concrete decisions in a few days. It is said that the Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, advocates implementing a special "sea and air patrol" policy, which is to have American warships or aircraft patrol a few miles away when ships transport weapons to Britain. If suspicious aircraft or submarines are found, a warning will be issued to allow the ships behind to change course in time to avoid danger; This disguised escort method allows the United States to avoid the excuse of direct intervention in the war, so it will not conflict with the restrictive clauses of the Neutrality Act or the Lend-Lease Act, and it is indeed worth considering by the American authorities.</p>
<p>In summary, it is credible that the United States is relying on China's operations in the Far East, and taking a "standby" stance in the South Pacific. As for Europe, because Britain's situation is relatively tight, the United States seems to have the determination and preparation to support Britain's invincibility at all costs, so in the next few days, the world may see the rapid unfolding of American actions.</p>
<h3>President's Eldest Son Flew from Philippines to Hong Kong Yesterday; After Three-Day Stay, Flying to Chongqing; All Circles in Chongqing Prepare to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Captain Roosevelt, the eldest son of the US President, arrived here today by Clipper plane from Manila and announced that he would go to Chongqing in three days to serve as an investigator. Captain Roosevelt believes that he is serving as a military observer and frankly admits that he does not have sufficient military experience to serve in this position. He said that he will meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and will stay in Chongqing for four days. He also tracked down that his grandmother took 108 days to travel to Hong Kong 81 years ago by the famous American Clipper sailing ship, while he arrived in Hong Kong in seven days by Clipper plane this time. (United Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Manila - After Captain Roosevelt, the eldest son of the US President, flew by Clipper plane to Hong Kong, well-informed sources announced today that Roosevelt's trip to Chongqing is intended to further assure China of the United States' concern for China. After a three-day stay in Hong Kong, Roosevelt will fly to Chongqing. The Chinese side here is very pleased with the United States' decision to send the President's son to China while increasing aid to China. The Chinese side declared that Chongqing is ready to give Roosevelt a grand welcome. Before his departure, Roosevelt said that he would travel to various parts of the interior from Chongqing, hoping to understand the situation in China. It is believed here that Roosevelt's trip to Chongqing is mostly a gesture of goodwill from the United States to China, and Roosevelt's qualifications are not enough to serve as a military observer. There are already permanent US Army and Navy counselors in Chongqing who are familiar with the Sino-Japanese War. Some people here speculate that if the United States takes the route of the Indian Ocean to transport British supplies to North Africa, Roosevelt will go to the Red Sea area as an official observer. But Roosevelt said that after completing his current mission, he will return to the United States via the Pacific Ocean. There is also speculation here that if the development of the Far East situation makes Roosevelt's visit to Singapore a valuable diplomatic gesture, then Roosevelt will go to Singapore before returning to the United States. Roosevelt did not report to Admiral Hurd, commander of the Asian Fleet, which shows that his trip to China is a diplomatic mission, not a position in the Marine Corps stationed in China. Admiral Hurd is currently leading the fleet in exercises in the Philippine waters. Roosevelt did not meet with him during his short stay here.

<h3>Young Evaluates the Current Situation in the Far East; Japan Cannot Defeat China</h3>
<p>Washington - Mr. Young, who served as a news reporter in Japan for many years, was arrested and detained by the Japanese for 61 days last year. Yesterday, he published a book entitled "After the Rising Sun," which is very interesting about Far Eastern affairs. He said that Japan will never achieve complete victory in China. Japan's desire to use its position in China and Vietnam to penetrate the Pacific Ocean is like Germany's current use of the Netherlands and other countries as a base for attacking Britain. When publishing this book, Young also sent a circular to the members of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, criticizing the State Department's Far Eastern policy as diplomatic deception, saying that a special committee should be organized now to eliminate some Far Eastern experts with erroneous ideas. When he gave public speeches in 140 cities in the country, he took his listeners' feelings into consideration and said that the public wanted to take action on the steady stream of war materials being shipped to Japan under the State Department's licenses.

<p>Fancheng: Since the 10th, the battle on the southern foot of the Dahong Mountains has seen the Japanese army, with several thousand troops under the cover of artillery and machine guns, launch a fierce three-pronged attack northwards, engaging in fierce fighting with a certain Hua unit in the mountainous area north of the Jingzhong Road.

<h3>Severe Rice Shortage in Chongqing; Authorities Transport Rice for Relief; Official Price Set at 46.5 Yuan per Dou; Private Rice Shops Sell for 60 to 90 Yuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Officials announced today that the municipal government, in cooperation with the National Food Administration, will transport 4,680 shi of rice to Chongqing to alleviate the severe rice shortage here. According to the same announcement, Chongqing needs 1,850 shi of rice daily, but although this number is high, the situation is expected to improve. The rice shortage in recent days has resulted in long lines of rice buyers in front of official rice stores. Mayor Wu Guozhen stated last night that he would contact the National Food Administration to supply Chongqing's daily need of 1,850 shi. Today, the official price is set at 46.5 yuan per dou, but private stores are raising prices to 60 to 90 yuan per dou. At the same time, Sichuan Chairman Zhang Qun promulgated regulations to prevent hoarding of various kinds in Sichuan province. According to the new regulations, rice merchants must obtain licenses and permits, otherwise, they will be treated as speculators or hoarders. This allows the government to directly supervise all rice merchants. Those who are not registered will be severely punished. The announcement stated, "Anyone who interferes with or obstructs the transport of rice will be arrested and prosecuted." Farmers are also ordered to register their rice production with the government; otherwise, they will also be treated as speculators. According to the National Food Administration, the cause of the rice shortage is that farmers are not selling rice at the lower price set by the government, and another reason is insufficient transportation. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: In recent days, the rice market in Chongqing and some other places has experienced great fluctuations. Government-controlled rice shops have no rice for sale, and black market rice prices have once soared to over 380 yuan per shi. The reason for the shortage is said to be that it is the busy farming season, and villagers have no time to transport rice to the market, and that the long drought has caused hoarders to take a wait-and-see attitude. In fact, the biggest reason is the troublemaking of rice weevils. However, since the heavy rains in western Sichuan, and continuous rain for three nights near Chongqing, people's minds seem to have become more stable, so 4,688 shi of rice were transported here yesterday, which was immediately distributed to various stores, and sold according to the government-set price of 165 yuan per shi, with a limit of one shi per household. The rice market turmoil has thus come to an end. The Food Administration is still continuing its efforts to open up sources, and the banking community plans to contribute 3 million yuan to request the Bureau to purchase and store rice in preparation for urgent needs. Mayor Wu Guozhen greatly agrees with this suggestion. (Havas dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<h3>China Can Definitely Cope With International Changes; Believes European War Will Last Six to Ten Years</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The general Chinese interpretation of recent developments in Europe is that the European war may last six to ten years. While the British and Americans are determined to defeat Germany, the Chinese officialdom continues to express its belief that China can cope with any changes in the international situation. However, those Chinese who hope that Britain and the United States will win early so that they can turn their attention to the solution of Far Eastern problems cannot help but feel somewhat disappointed. However, although the Allies have failed in the Balkans, China has not shown the slightest sign of accepting defeat or leaning towards the Axis, which is very noteworthy. Pro-Soviet elements have also been severely hit as a result of the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty, as it contradicts the spirit of the previous Chinese-Soviet treaty. In general, the Chinese still firmly believe in the future of democratic countries, because Britain and the United States have great resources, and the United States will definitely take active action when Japan attacks Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, or the Philippines.

<p>London: There is little new news about the war in Greece. It is only known that the British and Greek armies are now being pressed by German troops advancing towards Athens. This morning, the German official news agency said that the 12th Division of the German mechanized forces had reached Thebes on the Athens railway line. According to the British military communiqué issued last night, the British army continued to retreat in an orderly manner after inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, but said that the British army line was still unmoved, and believed that the left wing of the British army was still in contact with the Greek army. Today, the German side also announced that it had occupied the four Greek islands of Milos, Lesbos, Samothrace, and Lemnos in the Aegean Sea. The small number of Greek troops stationed on Lemnos Island resisted fiercely, and only succumbed after several hours of fierce fighting. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<p>German Occupation of Greek Islands Controls Gateway to Black Sea</p>
<p>Vichy: After the German army occupied the two Greek islands of Samothrace and Lemnos in the Aegean Sea, observers here generally believe that this is one of the most important events in the war in Southeast Europe. The German side's move is not only intended to relieve the siege of the Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands, but also because the occupation of the port of Mudros on Lemnos Island has virtually controlled the entrance to the Dardanelles, as the port is less than 100 kilometers from the straits. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Athens: After the German army occupying the Greek island of Samothrace issued an ultimatum, they sent a team of troops at 5 a.m. yesterday to land on the Greek island of Lemnos, 30 miles away. The island is not far from the entrance to the Dardanelles and is of great strategic importance. A small team of Greek infantry and police stationed on the island resisted for more than four hours. According to semi-official Greek reports, the Greek governor of Samothrace issued an ultimatum, ordering Lemnos Island to surrender by midnight on Wednesday, otherwise it would be occupied by force. The Greek governor of Lemnos Island then asked the government for instructions and received orders to fulfill its duties and preserve the glory of Greece. At 5 a.m. yesterday, a German transport ship, protected by aircraft, arrived at Purnia port on Lemnos Island and began to send troops ashore. A small Greek garrison resisted, and it ended at 9 a.m. All Greek officials on the island were ordered by the Greek government on Crete Island to remain in their positions. Greek Interior Minister Maniadakis has telegraphed the Greek governor of Lemnos Island, saying that the struggle of the garrison has greatly excited the entire country of Greece and has added another glorious page to the history of Greek warfare against the two countries.

<h3>Japan and Spain's Participation in the War Depends on the Outcome of the Egyptian War; Speculation by London Insiders</h3>
<p>London: A well-informed British source recently stated that whether Japan and Spain will participate in the war to help the Axis will be determined by the outcome of the Egyptian War. The Greek war is only a prelude to the most important Egyptian war.

<h3>Britain Mobilizes Far East Empire into Large-Scale Arsenal; Australia and India as Military Supply Manufacturing Centers —Pacific Society Survey Report—</h3>
<p>San Francisco: According to a survey report completed by the Pacific Relations Society, in the past six months, Britain has organized and mobilized its Far East empire into an arsenal factory, on a scale far larger than all of its possessions in the New World. Britain's creation of a self-sufficient military industrial center in its Far East empire east of the Suez Canal was decided at the Far East Conference held on October 25, 1940, in New Delhi, the capital of India. Representatives of the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, India, Burma, Ceylon, South Africa, East Africa, Rhodesia, Palestine, and Hong Kong participated in the conference. In addition, delegations from the Dutch East Indies and Roger also participated in the conference. The Roger delegation was sent by the British Ministry of Military Supplies to India to investigate Indian industrialists. According to the survey, the conference lasted for a month, and all resolutions were considered military secrets and not announced. The survey has revealed that the conference recognized the fundamental weakness of the British Empire during wartime, which was the concentration of its industry in a single center, while the empire itself was developed everywhere, creating a centrifugal force. This situation was generally regarded as a major military shortcoming. In view of this, the conference immediately decided to establish a new industrial zone in the Far East to remedy this weakness and to accelerate the production and distribution of military supplies, so as to make the Far East empire self-sufficient in military supplies. India and Australia have been selected as the centers for military supply manufacturing. The survey also stated that although India's geographical location is very suitable and its mineral resources are very rich, it is an ideal industrial supply center for supplying military supplies to various strategic points between Egypt and Malaya. India is now one of the world's largest iron-producing countries. The newly discovered iron deposits in Punjab are believed to be comparable in reserves to the best Swedish iron mines. The production of steel ingots has now increased to more than 100,000 tons per month, while the monthly average in 1938 was only 81,000 tons. The production of pig iron and iron alloys has also increased to 180,000 tons per month, an average increase of 40 percent compared to 1938. The large-scale Indian Iron &amp; Steel Company is stepping up its work to manufacture various high-quality products such as thick iron armor. Factories are also producing field guns, anti-aircraft guns, Bren guns, machine guns, and rifles. Since the beginning of the war, the production of shells has increased tenfold, and the production of artillery has increased sevenfold. The survey also stated that thirty armored vehicles, entirely constructed in India, are being prepared this year for use by 85 newly established motor transport units in the army. In addition, 25,000 vehicles produced annually will be assembled in India factories of Ford and General Motors. The survey also stated that an Indian aircraft company has established a factory in Bangalore, and military aircraft will soon be produced. The capital of the factory is about 15 million yuan. The Indian branch of Imperial Chemical Industries is also producing huge amounts of sulfuric acid, chlorine gas, caustic soda, and other military chemicals. Shipyards in Bombay and Bengal are rushing to manufacture naval vessels. The survey pointed out that India has now become an amazing arsenal. The survey also stated that in Australia, industrial manufacturing is equally strained. Those now engaged in manufacturing have most of the items in the three-year US$1,812,000,000 armament order, and the items in this year's US$744,000,000 order. By June of this year, Australia will have 150,000 skilled workers in the munitions factories alone. At that time, these factories will spend US$400 million. In addition to munitions, Australia is also producing training aircraft, machine guns, rifles, and cannons of various calibers, some of which are the largest and best. The survey also stated that although people in New Delhi said that they would only engage in manufacturing and not sell to other places, Britain's orthodox observation of commerce as a weapon has not been neglected. Precise utilization of surplus exports to gain profits in international exchange is also an important military condition. Regarding this emphasis on international trade, the most obvious are Manila, the world's largest producer of gutta-percha and tin. The United States is the best customer for the export of these two items. The United States pays US$12 million per month to purchase these two items for Britain to purchase needed supplies in the United States. Therefore, Malaya can be said to be Britain's "gold reserve." The survey further stated that for the production of military supplies, the British Empire has now formed two major empires, one in the western world, based on the United Kingdom and Canada, and the other in the Far East, with India and Australia as production centers and Singapore as a base for defense and attack. The survey also stated that the Far East Conference has established a permanent committee, which is now located in London. It is still undecided whether Britain will continue to maintain this dual structure after the war. However, it is widely believed that Britain will continue to maintain the industrial development of Australia and India. (United Press Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Japan Approve Neutrality Pact</h3>
<p>Moscow: On April 25, 1941, the Japanese Emperor approved the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and Declaration signed in Moscow on April 13, 1941. At the same time, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also approved the pact and the declaration on the same day. At this point, according to Article 3 of the agreement, it has been in effect since April 25th. (TASS Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently gave a speech at a public gathering in the Hibiya Hall, saying that he was very honored by the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. Matsuoka then described his trip to Europe, saying that what he wanted had been fully described in his broadcast speech upon his return to the country, and there was nothing new to add. Regarding the Italian army's defeat, Matsuoka said, "Any people who want to alienate Italy from the Axis are very stupid." Matsuoka praised Germany's economic control, saying that Japan should follow Germany's current methods and not stick to the old system of twenty years ago. Control should be based on cooperation and should not force the people. He then said that he was very honored by the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, and that the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations could be realized sooner or later.

<h3>U.S. Navy Secretary Criticizes Soviet Union, Believing Treaty with Japan is Part of Axis Ring; Will Study Problem of Breaking this Ring; Aid to Britain Will be Escorted</h3>
<p>Washington: The most interesting development in Far Eastern events in the past 24 hours has been Navy Secretary Knox's inclusion of the Soviet Union in the Axis network in his speech. In recent months, U.S.-Soviet relations have been gradually improving, but since the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty has been signed, U.S.-Soviet relations have become cold. Now, Knox has publicly announced the feelings of the U.S. authorities on this treaty, believing that this is one of the links in the chain that the Axis powers are currently forging to encircle the United States. This idea clearly reflects a trend in psychological development here, that is, whoever is not friendly to us is our enemy. Knox's statement that the United States is now being gradually surrounded will quickly spread throughout the country. It is expected that informed people in the country will therefore raise the question of when to break this encirclement, whether to break it before the circle approaches, or to wait until it tightens. Now, the four continents have surrounded the United States, as Hull said. Many people believe that Knox's remarks on the Far East are a warning to Japan, meaning that the United States is now willing and prepared to fight. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: Observers here believe that two points are clear in Navy Secretary Knox's speech: (1) The U.S. Navy will decide to escort war materials to Britain. (2) The Soviet Union's assistance to Japan makes it an even greater threat to the United States in the Pacific. Therefore, as far as Washington is concerned, the Soviet Union is within the Axis network. Since the outbreak of the European War, Knox's remarks have been the most candid of any cabinet member other than President Roosevelt. The reaction in the country to these very clear remarks will enable the President to follow them and issue his upcoming public remarks. Knox's statement that "We cannot allow our goods to be sunk at the bottom of the Atlantic. If we allow them to be lost, we will be defeated" is the clearest indication that the U.S. Navy is about to provide escorts. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Pittsburgh: Former Republican presidential candidate Willkie criticized the remarks made by Secretary of State Hull and Navy Secretary Knox, saying that if the supplies we ship overseas are sunk to the bottom of the sea, it will be useless to accelerate our production. The time has come for the government to use facts to show us and then guide public opinion, rather than follow public opinion. What is now necessary is to adopt the most effective methods recognized by naval and land warfare experts to protect all kinds of shipping. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>United States Announces Army Strength: Total of 1,180,000 Men</h3>

<h3>U.S. Aid to China Society Holds Sino-U.S. Art Exhibition; Anti-Aggression Painters Also Participate with Works</h3>
<p>New York: The U.S. Aid to China Committee recently held a modern Sino-U.S. art exhibition, with all proceeds going to aid Chinese refugee children. Two hundred well-known American artists, as well as three Japanese anti-aggression painters, were invited to participate. Various paintings and sculptures were displayed at the exhibition, all priced at US$100. About 75 Chinese items were displayed, mostly landscape, flower, bird, insect, and animal watercolor paintings. Gao Jianfeng, the late master calligrapher of Lingnan, his daughter, Zhang Shanzi, the late famous tiger painter, Ms. Xu, a disciple of Feng Chaoran, and the eldest daughter of Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, all participated with their works. A Japanese anti-aggression painter said, "The fact that I participated in the exhibition with my humble works can only express my love for peace, my hatred for war, and a small part of what I can do for the victims of aggression."

<h3>German Warships Active at Sea; British Ships Suffer Heavy Losses; One Dead and One Captured of the German Submarine Aces</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Naval High Command announced that German warships at sea have sunk 29,000 tons of British ships, and have now sunk another 30,000 tons. Since the beginning of the war, the German Navy has captured 872 enemy ships and confiscated ships from occupied countries, totaling 1,900,000 tons. Two of Germany's most outstanding submarine commanders, Kretschmer and Prien, and one submarine each under their command, have not returned to their home ports, but have destroyed enemy convoys in dangerous areas. These two have sunk enemy ships exceeding 500,000 tons. Among them, Kretschmer has fallen into the hands of British forces, and Prien has died. Mr. Kretschmer encountered two British destroyers on his last voyage and sank two of them. The total sunk reached 313,611 tons, including three British auxiliary cruisers.

<h3>Germany Says All Ships Aiding Britain Will Be Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin: Today, the newspapers here openly denounced the United States and President Roosevelt for accelerating the shipment of military supplies to Britain. The newspapers here have recently repeatedly stated Hitler's statement that any ships heading to Britain will be sunk. When asked about the issue of American ships going to Britain, Nazi officials quoted Hitler's speech on January 3 in reply, saying, "Anyone who wants to help Britain must recognize one point, that is, any ship, no matter what kind of fleet it is, must be sunk if it comes before our torpedoes."

<p>Refugee Relief Association First Hospital Relieves Poor and Sick Elementary School Teachers; International Sports Association Donates 1,500 Yuan; Relief Measures Established, Hope for Support from All Sectors</p>
<p>The First Hospital of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, located at 240 North Tibet Road, has recently received a donation of 1,500 yuan from the International Sports Association, specifically for the relief of poor and sick elementary school teachers in this city. It is reported that the relief measures are as follows: (1) The relief funds will be drawn from the existing 1,500 yuan donated by the International Sports Association and will continue until the funds are exhausted. (2) All poor and sick elementary school teachers and their families may obtain free treatment at the hospital if their school provides a letter of certification and the investigation proves the facts. (3) Five free beds are temporarily designated each day. If donations increase, the number of beds can be expanded. (4) Those from all walks of life who are happy to help with these funds can submit them to the hospital, which will issue an official receipt and publish an announcement of thanks. The hospital does not send anyone outside to solicit donations. It is found that prices in this city are soaring, causing a drastic increase in the cost of living. Medical expenses have also risen accordingly. The middle class still feels overwhelmed by the burden, let alone the average elementary school teacher, who works hard all day with meager salaries. Once they become ill, they are often unable to afford medical treatment, and their suffering cannot be described in words. This relief work of the hospital meets urgent social needs and is truly a good deed. However, using this 1,500 yuan fund to make such a grand gesture is like using a cup of water to put out a fire, and it will be difficult to sustain. It is hoped that kind people in the education sector who care about education will make a call and continue to donate, so that the number of beds can be increased, and countless poor and sick elementary school teachers and their families can regain their health. This is also good news for the education sector.</p>

<h3>The Labor Strike at Tonghui Elementary School Still Deadlocked Yesterday; Board of Directors Held Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The faculty and staff of the private Tonghui Elementary School at 253 Malang Road, French Concession, went on strike on the afternoon before last, requesting the school board to replace Principal Tang Guodong, due to fraud in the school's supply store, which was found to be true, the school board's improper handling, and the difficulty of life and the request to increase subsidies. Yesterday, the situation remained deadlocked. However, the Board of Directors had convened a meeting to discuss the aftermath, and the chairman of the Board of Directors and the principal and faculty members had all expressed their views. The reporter of Dihua agency filed the details after making various inquiries.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Board of Directors Convened Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the school board of directors convened a meeting. In addition to the seven directors attending, three teacher representatives, Gu Chuan-ying, Qu Li-fan, and Gu Zong-ying, were present. Chairman Jiang Zongpan, the teacher representatives presented four points of view: (1) Tang Guodong's fraud is true, which is detrimental to his personality. He is not able to lead his colleagues, let alone set an example for more than a thousand children. He should be replaced. (2) Improve treatment. (See yesterday's newspapers) (3) Guarantee teacher positions. Whether to renew or not, must be notified one month before the holidays. (4) The fraudulent funds of the supply store should be recovered by the board of directors. After the representatives presented the above opinions, the board of directors ordered the representatives to leave the meeting. The board of directors continued the meeting, and by 7:00 PM, no decision had been made. What the decision is, the chairman of the board of directors must answer to the teachers and staff from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM today. According to the Chairman of the Board, Jiang Zongpan, the journalist of Dihua agency said yesterday evening, our school had fraud in the school's supply store. The teachers and staff reported to the board of directors in writing and requested a thorough investigation. After review by our association, the responsible personnel were dismissed as a disciplinary measure. However, the teachers and staff believed that they were not satisfied, so the unfortunate incident of the strike and the destruction of desks occurred, which is very regrettable. It is found that the treatment of teachers and staff in our school is still quite generous, and the teachers and staff originally negotiated yesterday (26), but unexpectedly started the strike first the day before (15), which seems to be inappropriate. Fortunately, the education-related parties and all people are enthusiastic about mediation, and I am deeply grateful. I hope that the unfortunate dispute can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chinese Christian Association Promotes a Parents' Day to be Held on the Second Sunday of Every May</h3>
<p>The Chinese Christian Association, in order to promote the virtues of filial piety, increase the welfare of parents, and enhance parental education, has specially proposed that a Chinese Parents' Day be held on the second Sunday of every May (this year being May 11th). Various circles in Shanghai have expressed great sympathy for this. Various Christian churches, church organizations, and church schools have already begun preparations to hold solemn commemorations on that day. It is reported that the association has decided on a number of commemorative measures for the reference of people from all walks of life. As for individuals, they should wear flowers on that day to express their love and commemoration of their parents. Those whose parents are both alive should wear red flowers, those whose parents have passed away should wear white flowers, and those whose father or mother has passed away should wear blue flowers. Currently, the Shanghai YWCA has decided to urge its members to make a large number of Parents' Day flowers to be sold at a price of one dime each, for the use of people from all walks of life. The proceeds from the sale will be used entirely to support the Shanghai Nursery established by the association, which will also help poor parents to avoid various difficulties in raising children. Furthermore, if various sectors wish to order in large quantities, please notify the association one week before Parents' Day so that they can be made in time for use.</p>

<h3>Food The Foreign Rice Hoarders are Active Again The Subsidy Price is Soaring Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose again due to the activities of speculative hoarders. Based on the black market subsidy price, the price was higher by one or two yuan compared to the day before. At the early morning market, the subsidy price for each white bag of small patterned rice was 1,300 yuan, followed by 1,400 yuan to 1,450 yuan. No. 1 Saigon opened at 1,500 yuan, then rose from 1,600 yuan, 1,650 yuan to 1,700 yuan. Other glutinous rice followed suit. Broken rice in original bags reached 126 yuan. However, as far as forward contracts are concerned, the price increase in the market is still due to speculative manipulation. According to reports, more than 20,000 bags of newly arrived foreign rice continued to arrive. A forward contract for 1,500 tons of small patterned rice in early May was released by New Changsheng, with the price still at 150 yuan. There were also many other direct contacts. However, the people in the market were uneasy. Once the large households absorbed the rice, the market would rise with the sentiment of the people. The actual sales yesterday were only three or four thousand bags, while the hoarders and the western suburbs of Shanghai sold seven or eight thousand bags. Dumi only opened at 128 yuan for thin rice, an increase of 2 yuan. It is not easy to expect the price of rice to be stable before the rice market is managed and rice hoarders are not sanctioned.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has arrived at the port again. Jardine Matheson's Ding Sheng wheel arrived in Shanghai at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, carrying 17,093 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. Swire's Beihai wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying a batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The exact number will have to be determined tomorrow (Monday) because the ship arrived late and it was Saturday, so the exact number will have to be confirmed and reported tomorrow. (Grandfather)</p>
<h3>Canadian Flour Pours In Flour Prices Step Down</h3>
<p>Flour: The market situation for foreign flour yesterday was trending downward, because after Canadian flour arrived in succession, various new brands flooded the market. Although there were customers who inquired, the number was not large. It is said that the Northern Jiangsu Gang has already shipped more than 100,000 bags of Canadian flour to transship. Therefore, people's hearts are becoming more and more softened, and the market is showing a state of collapse. The unified market for Jinlong brand Canadian flour is 30 yuan and 34 cents. Hua Wu brand Australian flour has also returned to the 31 yuan mark, a drop of about half a yuan compared to before. The flour from the factory remains the same as before. Zhongfu New Supply supplied more than 5,000 bags, with the price being 25 yuan per original plate.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market situation is as dull as usual. In recent days, there have been some arrivals of domestic wheat and Dumi wheat, only a few dozen to one or two hundred bags. Most of them are directly allocated to customers or sent to Japanese factories, with a selling price of 45-46 yuan. As for the market supply, it has long been lacking, so there is no regular market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Cake Still Heading for Peak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes was trending upward under the impetus of the environment. Some of those restricted by the price limit still had little room to surge. Only soybean cake was outside the price limit, so it was regarded as the best target for making money in the minds of general speculators. Generally, in view of the scarcity of raw materials (soybeans), the smooth arrival of customer cakes, and the still lively sales market in the interior, snatchers and large and small hoarders came one after another. Therefore, they fought for it day after day, and the market was rushing straight to the peak. Yesterday, Sheng Ji opened 23,000-24,000 pieces of current and forward cakes, with prices detailed in the market price column. Dayou had 3,000 pieces of forward cakes, Yuanlong had four or five cars of forward cakes, Chang Ji had 3,000 pieces of Ming cakes, Yuan Ji had 5,000 pieces of forward cakes, and Lvsheng Ji had 1,000 pieces of forward cakes. On the 26th, 1,500 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai.</p>

The supply of British and American exchange rates was once very good. The spot and May US exchange rates once strengthened to 5.21875 yuan. The April issue was not slightly loosened due to the filling of short positions by speculators. On the contrary, the over-the-counter price was difficult to close.

The April issue was still 5.1875 yuan due to the filling of short positions by a certain household. HSBC's list of exchange rates did not change. Later, speculators continued to grab 5.21875 yuan without success. They closed at 5.1875 yuan in May, and also stopped the loose return to flat.

<h3>Gold Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold on the black market fluctuated slightly. The situation first fell and then returned, and the US dollar returned to flat after loosening.

Tong Kang Yong Defu Shi He and San Duo competed to sell, and immediately saw a further decrease of 15 yuan, to 6,655 yuan. It was rumored that the US dollar was 5.21875 yuan, and the current issue of this month was still difficult to close due to the compensation of a certain household. Cheng Ji Xinfeng Yong Yida Chi Da absorbed, and the price was raised to about 6,665 yuan. There was a slight detour. After 10:30, Heng Ji Defu Dafeng Xiangxing Yong also came in, and saw 26,685 yuan, which was sold by De Da.

<p>In the public debt black market, the market situation continued to trend upward yesterday. Although it was not very strong, it was unusually stable. It was heard that the resumption of business by the four major banks had been scheduled to be implemented next Monday, and from then on, the financial situation tended to be stable. The rebound of public debt was actually based on the sharp decline in the previous days. From then on, public debt could also tend to be stable. Yesterday, because it was Saturday and only half-day trading was done, Xiexing Yuanxinfu Lianyidetc. bought in one after another, and Shengxing Xie Kang sold slightly. The market price opened with an increase of four or five corners, and to the close, it was stable within one hour, with only five cents and one corner of ups and downs.

<p>In stock trading, 20 shares of Huacheng Yanhua Company were traded at a price of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers Different Views of Bulls and Bears There are Slight Fluctuations in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still not exciting, but the people who invest are bullish and bearish, and their intentions are different, so there is a slight increase. However, the actual situation is extremely bleak. The Hong Kong gang's intake is very astringent, so people's hearts are dimmed and there is little excitement. However, the general comfortable hoarders still drag and are unwilling to relax, but in terms of the current yarn, they are deeply afraid that it will not be easy to rise. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,486 yuan, and the low price was 1,474 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the end of the week, the spot price and foreign exchange market were closed, and people's hearts were slightly stable. It is said that the first time it was done was 1,490 yuan, and then 86 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of Double Horse in the morning, the market was scattered and weak, and although people were shouting, the transaction was very few. The first plate price was 1,480 yuan. After this plate was opened, observing the hand-raisers had a great hypocritical appearance. Then, as the spot price of gold trended weakly, buyers' interest waned, and it fell to 1,474 yuan. It went back and forth between 77 and 78 yuan for an hour and a half, but around nearly 12 o'clock, the sound of trade suddenly rose in the field, and floating short positions made up for it one after another, and the market gradually advanced, rising to 1,486 yuan at the close. The statistics of the volume of transactions in half a day are 8,222 packages. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Hoarders' Interest Greatly Reduced The Cotton Market is Dull</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is extremely calm. This is because yarn sales are narrow, and hoarders' hands are full of goods. In view of the current poor environment, the interest in kicking the ball is greatly reduced, so the transaction is very clear. The future is feared to have a downward trend.</p>
<p>Lan Orchid 207 House 100 pieces</p>
<p>Again 208 again 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fire grass bag 196.5 again 150 pieces</p>
<p>Again 197 again 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another news report on foreign cotton trading in Shanghai. Because the yarn market is still not improving, the buyer's interest is depressed, so the market situation is quiet and gradually weakening.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is quiet and firm, rising due to trading by the same industry and good cotton cloth trade. Yesterday's closing price was 4-5 pounds higher than the previous day. The statistics of US cotton from August 1, last year to April 25, this year are recorded on the left (500 pounds per package).</p>
<p>Cumulative listing 10,299,000 packages</p>
<p>Cumulative factory use 7,620,000 packages</p>
<p>Cumulative exports 864,000 packages</p>
<p>To Japan 88,000 packages</p>
<p>To China 50.2,000 packages</p>
<p>To the United Kingdom 340,000 packages</p>
<p>To Germany 139,000 packages</p>
<p>Stocks in various ports 6,209,000 packages</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is also quite firm, rising due to active short covering and strong purchases by buyers. At the same time, it also fell slightly due to a small portion of cotton merchants selling on the market and taking profits. As a result, except for white raw cotton, which rose by 9 rupees in April and May and 6 rupees in July and August, the rest rose by 1-3 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods The Cloth Price in Hong Kong Falls Back by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market trend yesterday was sluggish. Because the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs had a light intake, the cloth price in Hong Kong fell back, by 1 yuan to 2 yuan per piece. Therefore, the selling momentum of white goods turned strong, and the selling price was smaller. White goods, fine cloth and twill fell by 25 cents, and coarse cloth fell by 10 cents to 25 cents. The prices of Yihua, Lun Chang, bleached and dyed cloth and fine yarn woven products such as poplin and serge from this factory were still firm.

The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled 100 pieces, and the Nanyang gangs handled more than 100 pieces of twill colored cloth. Yesterday, 110 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.</p>

Fine twill was relatively stable, without much honor or disgrace. Serge was 1 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen and 2 li and a half, and the futures for the next month were still firm. The same industry did 1 yuan, 5 jiao and 7 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Sales of Rainproof Cloth Making Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the wool market was still . The prices of various goods, except for palace, remained firm, and the transactions had changed from wholesale to retail. The absorption of the same industry has decreased sharply, because most of the wool industry is from Ningbo. Since the war in Zhenciyongfeng, they have all felt uneasy. Only rainproof cloth still has transactions. Golden Bear old brand is in great demand, and it is reported that 3,400 yards were opened in the market yesterday, half of which were directly delivered by Yousheng Factory, and half of which were sold by large wholesalers. The price per yard is 4 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Forward Coarse White Rebounds</h3>

Taikoo Car White B Ma Dong Zhai 105 yuan and a half to 5 yuan, DY Ma Xi Zhai 9 yuan, 9 yuan, HM Ma 87 yuan, not much different. Guo Tang Chen Diao Qing opened 268 bags yesterday at 68 yuan, which was handled by this factory for the raw material of Binhua Qing.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Out of Stock Substitutes Being Manufactured</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have been difficult to obtain due to difficulties in the source of supply, and there have been no arrivals for a long time. The existing stock has long been exhausted. Before the out of stock, the highest retail price had reached 367 yuan, a ratio of 41 to the lowest price, which can be said to be an unprecedented new record. Those in this city who specialize in making pickled mustard tubers have taken this into account, so they have tried to make hundreds of . The raw material is Maitreya vegetable (ie瘤芥菜). It is expected to be launched soon when the vegetarian diet is about to be launched. Once it is ripe, it will be used to fill the gap. However, it is heard that the quality is inferior.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items Fixed Soap Price Approaching Half a Yuan Per Piece</h3>
<p>The purchase price of daily necessities such as soap is trending higher day by day. The factory's raw material costs such as alkali are huge, and hoarders still hold on to this and raise the price. The market price is like a horse that has run away, running fast and difficult to control. Yesterday, the market opened, such as the fixed soap, which has reached 55 yuan and 5 jiao per box. The price is too high. Regardless of its actual situation, the sales will eventually be seized by other soaps. Baixiangmao soap is 48 yuan per box, Huangxiangmao soap is 41 yuan and 5 jiao per box, and Arrow Knife soap is 42 yuan per box. All have slightly increased. The market atmosphere is unusually firm, so the price is difficult to return. Daily necessities are so expensive, and the general public really has the pain of being unable to bear the burden.</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Diamond Industry in Wartime Europe</h3>
<p>— A Farmer</p>
<p>(1) A Review of the Diamond Industry</p>
<p>The technique of diamond cutting originated in the city of Antwerp, Belgium, in the 15th century AD. It gradually progressed thereafter, reaching its peak at the end of the 19th century, also due to the development of the famous South African Transvaal diamond mines at that time, which could supply large quantities of raw materials. For many years, diamonds were merely adornments for the wealthy, but at this time, even the middle class could have a small, dazzling diamond inlaid in rings and earrings, and its value was no longer unattainable!</p>
<p>The prolonged global prosperity before the First World War gave the diamond industry a very active period. It had some specially selected customers. The wealthy Imperial Russia was an excellent outlet for diamonds from the two major cities of Antwerp and Amsterdam in Belgium. The incredibly wealthy Indian princes also indulged their gem desires as much as possible. However, who besides the United States, with its gold dollars, was the top customer for diamond merchants, absorbing nine-tenths of their goods? Taking the amount of purchases by the United States as an example, in 1909, the value of diamonds imported into the United States was $17,369,405. During the First World War, it naturally decreased, so in 1918 it was $8,264,021. The Treaty of Versailles was signed, and it immediately rebounded, rising to $64,222,947 in 1919. Thereafter, until the Great Depression, the level of imported value was often maintained at twice the pre-war level. For example, in 1919, the statistical figures still showed $42 million, but by 1930, it had plummeted to $23 million. The situation was even worse in the next four years. In the following three years, there was a slight recovery, but unexpectedly, in 1938, it sharply decreased to $17,016,024, setting an unprecedented record in peacetime.</p>
<p>(2) The Situation in Wartime</p>
<p>This sharp reduction in purchasing power in the United States naturally dealt a ruthless and significant blow to diamond industry centers such as Antwerp and Amsterdam. For a time, the brokers, polishers, and others who depended on this for a living were greatly disturbed and worried, living in a state of constant anxiety. No other industry in the world is so sensitive to global economic crises and the tense atmosphere of war preparations! However, this disturbance soon subsided, and most surprisingly, at the very beginning of the outbreak of the European war in September 1939, diamond trading showed a great tendency to improve. At that time, a very large batch of orders came from the Americas, especially for diamonds of small size and quality, so that the price of this type of goods immediately rose by 20% to 25%. Why did the outlet for diamonds improve after the outbreak of the war? This cannot but lead to a slight reflection on the situation during the First World War. During the First World War, the Netherlands strictly maintained neutrality and became the largest and most important customer for diamonds from the belligerent countries, making considerable profits afterwards. Now, the United States, which possesses the greatest wealth, naturally wants to copy the old trick, buying some treasures and diamonds to play with its surplus funds. When others see Americans doing this, they also turn their minds and follow suit, so the sales of diamonds immediately become very active.</p>
<p>However, the Belgian Diamond Industry Association, in its monthly publication, warned people not to be too optimistic. It believes that this war is in no way comparable to the one in 1914, because at that time, it had experienced a long period of prosperity, and sales were far wider and purchasing power was far greater than now. Moreover, the monetary system at that time was far simpler than now.... Its understanding prevailed, and the trend of ordering diamonds was not as enthusiastic as before. The end of 1939 passed in peace.</p>
<p>Even so, the general ideal now is that diamonds are a very beneficial way to entrust wealth. They are light in weight, easy to carry, and will not cause any obstacles when fleeing to foreign countries. Therefore, based on this mentality, no general diamond collector is willing to exchange their diamonds for banknotes or government bonds of uncertain value. However, they also have a concern, which is the fear that the value of diamonds will fall. To prevent this from happening, they have a very meticulous organization and plan. There is a diamond company in England called De Beers, which almost completely controls the rough diamonds extracted from the mines. It has a general sales organization in London called the Diamond Corporation, which distributes rough diamonds to a total of diamond center cities. These organizations, relying on their abundant capital and the contracts they have signed with the diamond producers, can stockpile a total of diamonds and then slowly and in small quantities sell them abroad, so that its value will not be shaken by others.</p>
<p>(3) The So-Called Industrial Diamonds</p>
<p>Diamonds are not only used as ornaments. There are so-called "unmarketable" diamonds (that is, those that cannot be cut into jewelry), and their uses in industry are extremely varied and ever-changing. For example, the reason why we call it "diamond" is because of its unparalleled hardness, which can penetrate any other object, and can be used for drilling. The machine used to drill coal mines, oil wells, hot springs, or any kind of mine has a cap made of diamond on its head. The machines that press and roll metal wires, no matter how thick or thin, are also made of diamond. The manufacture of automobiles or airplanes cannot be carried out at all without tools made of extremely hard metal or diamond. The large saw with a diameter of two meters used in the stone cutting industry has more than 150 diamonds inlaid on its saw teeth! As for the glass industry, the watch industry, or the bakelite industry, diamonds all have their indispensable contributions and positions! Moreover, the use of diamonds in industry is only in its infancy, and its future development is even more immeasurable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Poppy (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Moreover, at that time, the commercial hegemony of the Indian Ocean, the South Seas archipelago, and the Chinese coast was in the hands of the Arabs. This splendid rice flower, which can "disperse the sorrows of travelers thousands of miles away," also landed on the Chinese mainland with their footsteps as Arab merchants frequently traded with China. This was at the end of the 8th century AD, during the Zhenyuan reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty. The import of this poppy into China was only because it could "stop diarrhea, consolidate prolapse of the rectum, ... stop pain in the heart, abdomen, muscles, and bones (Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica)." Who would have thought that such a wonderfully useful elixir would eventually become a violent poison that would bankrupt families, "like a murderous weapon, not called a tobacco pouch but a gun"? Improper use, leaving endless troubles, is a human error, so how can we blame the things themselves?</p>
<p>The name opium is translated from the Latin word Opinm. Li Shizhen marked it as "Opian" in the Compendium of Materia Medica, with a note below saying that its common name is "opium." Afion comes from the Arabic word Afion. Li Shizhen also said: "Afion was rarely heard of in previous generations, but recently some people have used it, saying it is ... the juice of flowers." However, Li Shizhen only mentioned that opium can stop diarrhea and consolidate yang, and like the accompanying "one golden pill" prescriptions, all were taken orally, and there was absolutely no mention of smoking it with a pipe. Therefore, the smoking of opium actually started in the late Ming Dynasty. As for who invented it, whether it was created by the Chinese themselves or passed down from abroad, it is somewhat vague and difficult to verify. According to the Complete History of the Qing Dynasty by the Japanese Inaba Kunzan, "Opium made into its modern form is only four hundred years old, and was actually created by the Chinese.... Foreigners generally ingest opium through the mouth and send it to the stomach, but the Chinese alone are different, using tobacco smoking methods as a medium." However, judging from the Buddhist scriptures cited earlier, the method of smoking may also have been passed down from abroad. What exactly happened, it is still impossible to draw a conclusion now.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Shanghai's Financial Stability: Four Banks to Resume Operations Tomorrow; Security Measures Agreed Upon with Police Authorities; Year-End Accounting to Be Expedited</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, after temporarily suspending operations on the 17th of this month, were subject to rumors spread by speculators, all of which were unfounded. According to authoritative sources in the banking industry yesterday, the four banks had long been ordered to resume operations, but the resumption was delayed due to consultations with the police on security issues. Now that everything is ready, it has been decided that all branches will resume operations simultaneously tomorrow (Monday), and the various rumors circulating will be dispelled. The reporter further inquired about this matter with a person in charge of a major commercial bank in this port, and confirmation was also obtained. It is also understood that after the four banks resume operations tomorrow, the authorities in the concessions will provide thorough security and protection. Regarding the entire financial situation of Shanghai, the four banks are determined to maintain it.</p>
<p>Month-End Approaching: Accounts Need to Be Settled</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that Chinese merchants in this city are eagerly awaiting the possible resumption of operations of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China on Monday, as the end of the month is approaching and many accounts handled by the four banks before the suspension of operations need to be settled. Therefore, the resumption of operations of the four banks is urgently needed. An important official of the Bank of China told reporters this morning (the 26th) that if no major military incidents occur within two days, the four banks will definitely resume operations. However, this matter has not yet been officially announced. Rumors that although the four banks are currently closed, payment orders from various firms and banks to the four banks can be cleared at the bank clearing house have been found to be inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Police Send Armored Cars to Protect the Court</h3>

<p>After General Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Army, was unfortunately killed on the morning of the 24th, the whole country grieved together. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was also deeply saddened after hearing the news. He has already issued a hand order to grant a special pension of 50,000 national currency units and requested the government to issue a public commendation. The surviving children will be raised by the state, and telegrams will be sent to all officers and soldiers to express condolences. Xie's funeral arrangements can be described as extremely honorable. All sectors of this city felt that Xie shared weal and woe with the people of Shanghai for four years, and the friendship was deep and heartfelt. All sectors of the city went to the Lone Army Barracks yesterday to pay their respects, reaching as many as 15,000 people. The scene was tragic and unprecedented, fully demonstrating that exemplary soldiers are admired by everyone. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 People Went to Pay Their Respects</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, people from all sectors of this city went to the Lone Army Barracks to pay their respects. Due to the large number of people, they lined up outside the barracks and entered in an orderly manner. The number of people in the morning reached more than 4,000. In the afternoon, it was very crowded. The queue started from the camp gate and extended for more than ten yards. Due to the large number of people, it took half an hour to take turns, causing more than a thousand people to wait on the roadside. The intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road was crowded with people, and traffic was completely blocked. The police authorities immediately dispatched many more police officers to maintain traffic. The citizens who paid their respects were mostly students, but there were also many from the industrial and commercial sectors. By 7:00 PM, the number had reached more than 15,000. After they entered, they were led by soldiers to the auditorium, where they bowed twice to Xie's portrait, and then went to the coffin to pay their respects to the remains. Whether they knew him or not, everyone shed tears for him. The depth of emotion was such.</p>
<p>The Authorities Have Allocated 10,000 Yuan for Funeral Expenses</p>
<p>The issues after Xie's death and the follow-up arrangements for the Lone Army Barracks have been properly arranged by the central authorities stationed in Shanghai. It is reported that 10,000 yuan has been allocated for funeral expenses, and personnel have been sent to instruct everything. As for the rumor that the funeral expenses were temporarily advanced by the Public Works Department by 10,000 yuan, it has been verified that it is inaccurate. Xie's coffin is still temporarily placed in the auditorium, covered with the national flag, but a part of the glass coffin lid is exposed, so that all sectors can pay their respects to the remains. The funeral will be held in two weeks, and a memorial service will be held in advance. Yesterday, all sectors of this city sent condolences and flower wreaths. Those who paid their respects also went to the Lone Army Barracks Industrial Cooperative to purchase products made by the Lone Army to show their remembrance.</p>
<p>Young Students Went to Pay Their Respects</p>
<p>The late Commander Xie had a close relationship with the teachers and students of various schools in this city. In recent days, Jiaozhou Road has been filled with young students, almost blocking the road. Most of them were holding flower wreaths, followed by a large group of students, or went collectively with teachers. Today is Sunday, and more teachers and students from various schools will automatically go to pay their respects. It is also heard that many schools plan to take turns to pay their respects next week. On the one hand, they can pay their respects to the remains of a patriotic soldier, and on the other hand, it can be used to stimulate national consciousness education. It is also heard that the Education Association of this city sent a large elegiac plaque yesterday, with the four characters "Spirit Never Dies" written on it, which was hung in the barracks, which aroused the attention of those who went to visit. The admiration of the educational circles of this city for patriotic soldiers can be seen from this.</p>
<p>National Radio Station Broadcast Condolences</p>
<p>Chongqing, 25th - General Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Army regiment of the Fourth Bank in Shanghai, was assassinated and killed in Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. When the bad news came, the whole country grieved together. The International Radio Station, in order to express its respect for the national hero Commander Xie, decided to broadcast "Condolence Broadcasts" to Shanghai from 6:30 PM on the 26th. The broadcast will be hosted by Zhou Cunai, a former subordinate of Xie's, a major in the artillery, and Yang Huimin, who presented the flag to the Lone Army of the Fourth Bank in the past, will be invited to speak. Ms. Yang has already telegraphed today to express condolences to the Lone Army remaining in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Minister of Education Chen Sent an Urgent Telegram of Condolence</p>
<p>Dahua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th - Minister of Education Chen Lifu sent a telegram to the Lone Army Barracks: Urgent, sent by Shanghai to the Lone Army Barracks, Lei, Deputy Commander of the Regiment, and transferred to all officers and soldiers. It is with great grief that I learn of the assassination of Commander Zhu. Recalling the great achievements of the Lone Army in defending the four lines of defense and fighting hard, and the great spirit of steadfastness, heroism, unyieldingness, and indomitableness, will surely keep the righteous spirit alive and be immortal forever. I hope you will continue his legacy and strive for the future. I respectfully send a telegram to express condolences and hope that you will restrain your grief. Chen Lifu bowed and apologized.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Expressed His Grief</p>
<p>Chongqing, 25th - Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee, sent a telegram of condolences to Xie Jinyuan's family because Commander Xie Jinyuan suddenly died. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To the family of Xie Jinyuan in Shanghai, Brother Jinyuan has an heroic appearance and possesses the virtue of loyalty and integrity. During the Battle of Shanghai, he repeatedly crushed the Japanese offensive. When he led 800 Lone Army soldiers and guarded the four lines of defense warehouse, he stood up the national flag alone on the bank of Suzhou River. His will was as strong as the mountains, and his morality was beyond Suiyang. His righteousness touched people, and everyone wept. He had hoped to restore the territory and become a barrier. The sudden news of his tragic death and the harm to the loyal and virtuous is deeply lamented. Although he has passed away, his righteous spirit will live forever. I respectfully send this telegram of condolences and pray that you will restrain your grief.</p>
<p>Readers Reduce Salaries and Send Condolence Money</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the staff of a certain silver shop, readers of this newspaper, sent a part of their salary, a total of 188 yuan, to this newspaper to send to the Lone Army Barracks as a condolence gift. It has been sent by this newspaper. The original letter said, "To the chief writer of the Shen Bao newspaper, it is with deep pain that we learned from the newspaper that Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Barracks was tragically assassinated yesterday. Commander Xie's loyalty and courage during the defense of the four lines of defense is admired by all over the world. As the national crisis intensifies, we hoped to rely on him as the Great Wall, but why did his great ambitions not come to fruition and he was taken advantage of by traitors? Comrades feel sad about the national affairs. We also know that Commander Xie's family has an old father and young children, so we reduced a part of our salary, totaling 188 yuan, and sent it with this letter, hoping that you will transfer it to the family to comfort the orphans and show our admiration and express our humble feelings. We know that it is small, but we aim to promote social sympathy."</p>
<h3>Labor and Management of the Commercial Press to Talk Next Week; General Manager Wang Replied by Telegram; Colleagues Still Need to Study</h3>
<p>After Lu Gaoyi and Ms. Xing De continuously telegraphed Hong Kong General Manager Wang Yunwu to mediate the request of the colleagues of the Commercial Press, they received a reply from Hong Kong. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Lu and Xing convened representatives of the colleagues' association and talked at the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department. Lu showed the telegram and thoroughly analyzed the matter to exchange preliminary opinions. The association found the wording of the telegram to be quite interesting and needs to be taken back for study and consideration before making further talks on Monday. At the same time, colleagues were warned not to relax their work due to mediation and to step up preparations and strive for justice and reasonableness under the leadership of the association. According to Mr. Zhu, the person in charge of the colleagues' association, who told a reporter from the New Voice Society, this association made its lowest reasonable request because of soaring prices and made repeated and sincere appeals for more than a month. Its attitude is not warm and its actions are not cautious. It is completely different from general labor disputes. This association knows that the company is in difficulty, so the conditions it puts forward only require maintaining the legal minimum wage. In fact, as the staff of China's largest cultural institution, asking for the treatment of a minimum laborer, who can criticize it? As for the price of books, although it cannot be increased at will, it has at least increased several times. Popular books such as the English-Chinese Model Dictionary sold for 2 yuan and 5 jiao before the war, but now sell for 13 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen, an increase of five or six times. However, the salary increases for colleagues after the war, including rice subsidies, are at most 40 or 50 yuan. Moreover, the company says that it is in great difficulty, so how can tens of thousands of colleagues long-term savings be automatically returned? The colleagues in Hong Kong have a better life, so why is the Hong Kong currency repeatedly increased and distributed? All are colleagues of the Commercial Press, so why treat them so differently? In short, this association does not want to have major disputes at this time and place. Nian Gong's hunger strike was originally a very pitiful scene, but the company unexpectedly closed the iron gate. Now the association hopes that the management will not make empty sympathy, say less threatening words such as "stay if you agree, leave if you don't", take care of the overall situation, and quickly seek a reasonable solution. Whoever tied the bell must untie it, and it is still up to the company, because the company locked the iron bucket, so the company should open it first.</p>

<h3>The Battle Situation in Eastern Zhejiang is Stable; Chinese Troops Intercept in Separate Locations; Japanese Attempt to Land at Hutou Ferry is Repelled; Ningbo Was Looted When It Fell</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency learned from the Zhejiang Provincial Groups in Shanghai that the battle situation in Eastern Zhejiang is as follows: (1) Since the Japanese army broke into Ciqi, Fenghua, and other places, the fighting in the suburbs is still in progress. (2) Japanese warships full of Japanese soldiers attempted to land at Hutou Ferry in Fenghua under the cover of artillery, but were repelled by the garrison with machine guns. (3) In Wenzhou, both sides are engaged in fierce fighting on the south bank of the Ou River. (4) Shops in Ningbo and other places were looted when they fell, resulting in heavy losses. (5) The Chinese army in Ningbo is still gathering in the western suburbs of the city.</p>
<p>Foreigners in Ningbo are Still Safe</p>
<p>According to news from the church in this port, there are 12 British, 11 American, 2 German, and 54 foreigners of other nationalities remaining in Ningbo, residing in the Jiangbei bank and Jiangdong area, residing in various churches and power companies, and hanging the flags of various countries at the locations. All are safe now.</p>
<p>Traffic is Blocked, Coastal Ports are Closed</p>
<p>Since shipping between Shanghai and Eastern Zhejiang has completely stopped, and since there are battles at various coastal ports, it has been completely interrupted. However, the telegraphic communication between Shanghai and the interior of Eastern Zhejiang is still maintained, and it has been very crowded in recent days because the people of Zhejiang in Shanghai are sending telegrams to inquire. However, postal delivery has been very slow due to the traffic interruption. At present, mails sent to various coastal areas in Eastern Zhejiang cannot be delivered. The only route for travelers between Shanghai and Zhejiang was originally to travel through the mountains to Zhoushan and then transfer, or to cross Hangzhou Bay from Yuyao Andong, but it has also been completely closed due to the impact of the war. It is heard that the authorities have issued an order strictly prohibiting the families of public officials from going to sea to enforce the law.</p>
<p>The Process of the Fall of Ningbo and Zhenhai</p>
<p>Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port landed troops in boats from Zhenhai Xiaogang and Shitangzui outside the West Gate at dawn on the 19th. After dawn, they sent planes to bomb. After being blocked by the fortress troops, the battle was fierce. By noon, because plainclothes teams had mixed into Zhenhai, the Chinese army began to shift its positions, and Zhenhai fell. After the Japanese army arrived in the suburbs of Zhenhai, they sent boats again, attempting to go down the river from Meixu, but the Japanese forces were repelled after being blocked by the Chinese army. However, the battle situation has become serious, and various agencies in Ningbo began to withdraw. From dawn on the 20th, more than a dozen Japanese planes dispatched to bomb, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented. The sound of artillery continued throughout the day. The Chinese army began to evacuate the urban area at 3:00 PM and deployed defenses in the southwest suburbs. The urban area then fell.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Detention of Southern Country Merchant Ship - Japanese Authorities Lodge Protest - Say They Do Not Approve of the European War Extending to the Far East - Negotiations Still Underway, Peaceful Resolution Expected - Military Attaché of the Italian Embassy in Japan to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Times reports that the Japanese Navy spokesman revealed at a press conference yesterday (the 25th) afternoon that the Japanese Navy Commander Shimada Shigetaro has lodged a protest with the Italian naval authorities here regarding the detention of the Yugoslav cargo ship "Donicerav" by Italian sailors on Tuesday (the 22nd), but as of last night, no reply has yet been received from the Italian authorities.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Makes Two Statements</p>
<p>According to the spokesman, there is hope for a peaceful resolution to this matter soon. However, he stated that two points should be given special attention: (1) As far as the European war is concerned, Shanghai is a neutral zone; (2) The Japanese government has always maintained a policy of opposing the extension of the European war to the Far East. The spokesman further explained regarding the first point that the waters where the "Donicerav" cargo ship is anchored are within the Japanese-occupied zone and are not part of the territory of the belligerent countries currently at war in Europe. Regarding the second point, the spokesman also stated that the Japanese naval authorities, in accordance with the policy of the Japanese government, are committed to preventing disputes related to the European war from extending to the Far Eastern waters under Japanese control. He also pointed out that the armed garrisoning of the ship by Italian sailors is not in line with the policy of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Port Authorities Insist on Their Position</p>
<p>It is reported that officials from the Jianghai Customs Port Authority and the Italian authorities are still conducting negotiations. At the same time, the Italian sailors on the detained Southern ship have not been withdrawn. As for the details of the negotiations between the Jianghai Customs Port Authority and the Italian authorities, it is still impossible to ascertain. However, it is generally expected that the negotiations are progressing satisfactorily because the Jianghai Customs Port Authority is currently insisting on its position and arguing reasonably, pointing out that the Italian action is a violation of neutrality. Therefore, the matter should be completely resolved within a few days.</p>
<p>British Side Closely Monitoring Development</p>
<p>At the same time, the British authorities here are paying close attention to this case because the "Donicerav" cargo ship is chartered to the Australian Wheat Administration, and because Yugoslavia and Britain are wartime allies. However, the British Consul has not lodged a protest but is only closely monitoring its development. This attitude allows the withdrawal of the Italian sailors to not be embarrassing. According to the English "Great American Evening Post," the Italian Consul General Manli visited the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi yesterday to discuss the detention of the cargo ship.</p>
<p>Italian Military Officer Departs for Shanghai</p>
<p>The English "Great American Evening Post" reports that the Japanese authorities here have made representations regarding the seizure of the Southern country cargo ship "Thomicerav" by Italian soldiers. It is generally expected that the Italian soldiers will soon withdraw from the ship. However, as of now, the Italian soldiers are still stationed on the ship guarding it. It is heard that the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Melito, visited the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi this morning, presumably to continue discussing the matter. Furthermore, a dispatch from the Allied News Agency in Tokyo states that Colonel Pulelli, the naval attaché of the Italian Embassy in Japan (the highest-ranking Italian naval officer in the Far East), is departing for Shanghai tonight to "inspect." Pulelli's trip may be related to the seizure of the "Thomicerav."</p>
<h3>After the Reopening of the Four Banks, Rice Price Limits Will Be Lifted - Bean, Rice and Grain Guild Refuses to Purchase Hong Kong Rice - Authorities Decide to Sell Directly to Rice Shops</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the four banks, namely Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, temporarily suspended business on April 17. The Council received a report in advance and, considering the impact on the market after the suspension of business would be serious, it notified the Shanghai Rice Market, the Grain Trade Guild, and the Coal Market on the morning of the same day that all transactions would be temporarily based on the closing price on the afternoon of April 16 and should not be exceeded. This was an emergency measure aimed at stabilizing the market situation and avoiding a major disturbance in the market as a result. The above-mentioned price limit will be lifted immediately after the four banks resume business.</p>
<p>Procedures for Selling Hong Kong Rice Determined</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of food supply, the Council has reached an agreement with the Hong Kong Rice and Grain Administration. From now on, unless there are unexpected circumstances, the Council can obtain a normal and sufficient supply of rice from Hong Kong every month to regulate the market. According to the original plan, this rice was to be sold to the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Guild for resale to various rice shops, and then sold to food consumers at the lowest possible price. Now that the Guild has held a meeting to discuss this and expressed its inability to accept it, the Council's Board of Directors convened a special meeting on the morning of this day (the 26th) to discuss the matter specifically. As a result, it was decided that the Council will sell the rice shipped from Hong Kong directly to retail rice shops. The procedures will be handled by the two foreign firms, Xiangmao and Liji.</p>
<p>Cost per Bag is One Hundred and Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>The above two foreign firms have rich experience in the rice business but are not currently engaged in the rice trade. After the rice arrives in Shanghai, the cost per bag will be approximately one hundred and thirty yuan in national currency, which is more than twenty yuan lower than the current market price. It is firmly believed that after the Hong Kong rice is shipped to Shanghai and sold, it will definitely be effective in suppressing the rice price in the city.</p>
<p>French Authorities Order Rice Price Labeling</p>
<p>All large and small rice shops selling various domestic and foreign rice grains in the British and French Concessions were previously ordered by the authorities to label the selling price of all rice grains sold to facilitate identification. However, a few small shops in the French Concession dared to disobey the order and were investigated and punished by the police. Recently, after a long period of neglect, the French Concession authorities have reiterated the previous order, requiring all large and small rice shops to sell rice at labeled prices and not to deliberately violate the order, otherwise they will be punished according to the regulations. This order has been handed over to the Rice Shop Guild for distribution to all shops for compliance. A copy of the Rice Shop Guild's notice is transcribed below: Notice: It has been repeatedly notified by the Guild to affix price tags to daily necessities, and the case has been filed. Now, the French Concession authorities have notified that the type and price list of rice sold by each rice shop must be displayed on a sign outside the store or in an easily visible place. In addition, price tags should be marked by drawing lots and inserted into the rice bins. The format of the price tags should be one inch in size and should be written in Arabic numerals in addition to Chinese characters for identification and to facilitate investigation. Violators will be subject to a fine of one to five hundred yuan. Therefore, a summary notice is hereby issued, and it is hoped that all member rice shops will comply with it, and do not make a mistake. After receiving this notice, all shops complied with it yesterday.</p>
<h3>Water, Electricity, and Property Tax Surcharges Are Too Heavy - Difficult to Bear - Public Utility Charges Should Have Strict Limits</h3>
<p>The French Concession's French-owned Water and Electricity Company will implement an increase in water and electricity surcharges starting today. The electricity surcharge will increase from 103% to 125%, the power and lightning surcharges will increase from 140% to 190%, and the water surcharge will increase from 49% to 75%. At the same time, public buses and trams will also increase fares. In addition, the Public Concession's Municipal Council has recently announced the commencement of the summer property tax collection. According to the tax amount stated in the notice, which is based on the list of the Council's Tax System Inequality Research Committee, the original tax amount has also been greatly increased. Residents of both Concessions are currently suffering from high prices, and the authorities are frequently approving price increases for public utilities, which is truly unbearable. Most residents are now on the verge of being unable to maintain a minimum standard of living. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities, in addition to punishing speculation and hoarding to avoid stimulating prices, should strictly limit the charges for public utilities and anything that may increase the public burden, so as to leave residents with a little breathing space.</p>

<h3>Two Movie Theaters in Hongkou Thrown Hand Grenades - Gambling Den on Difeng Road Also Thrown Grenade</h3>
<p>The Rongguang Theater in Hongkou was suddenly attacked by two grenades at around 3:40 PM yesterday. Two Japanese male spectators and one female were injured by shrapnel on the spot. Afterwards, Japanese military police were dispatched to conduct a large-scale search, but the grenade throwers had already disappeared. The injured were then taken to Fumin Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the Donghe Theater, a Japanese-owned business on Wuchang Road, was also attacked by two grenades, injuring four or five people. A gambling den on Difeng Road near Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai was attacked by two grenades thrown at the lower level table area around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 25th).

<p>Rongguang Theater Bombing Situation</p>
<p>At 3:40 PM yesterday, a bombing occurred at the Rongguang Theater movie theater at 330 Haining Road in Hongkou. According to news obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, it appeared that someone had brought hand grenades into the theater after purchasing a ticket when the first movie was being shown yesterday afternoon. Before the movie was about to end, the grenades were thrown and exploded on the spot, injuring more than ten Chinese and Japanese people watching the movie in the theater. Five seriously injured men and one woman were taken to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment by car. Three of them were Chinese and three were Japanese expatriates. Due to the severity of their injuries, their names have not yet been ascertained.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Impose Martial Law and Search Pedestrians</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese military headquarters, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of armed Japanese soldiers and several military vehicles to the scene of the incident. Barricades were set up with barbed wire to cut off traffic in the vicinity, and a thorough search was conducted. Japanese soldiers were also sent to seal off the Suzhou Creek Bridge, allowing only foreigners and Japanese people to pass. The Waibaidu Bridge, Zhaopu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge were gradually reopened until 5:30 PM, but people entering and leaving were subject to strict inspection. The armed Japanese soldiers searching the scene of the incident had not yet withdrawn by the evening.</p>
<h3>Wu Weizhong Shooting Case - Lawsuit Withdrawn - Chen Zixin Found to Have No Connection</h3>
<p>Wu Weizhong, a native of Pudong, established the Minsheng Hospital at 5 Kangji Lane, Kangti Road in the French Concession, and served as its president. Last winter, Yang Longsheng, a fellow villager, went to Wu's hospital to request treatment for syphilis as a pretext. He suddenly opened fire with a pistol and shot Wu dead. After the incident, Yang Longsheng was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that, according to Yang's confession, the incident was instigated by Yang Jinsheng, who promised to pay a reward of 2,500 yuan after the completion of the task. Because he was arrested on the spot, he did not receive the reward. Then, Wu Xiaoshi, the concubine of the deceased, suddenly filed a lawsuit, alleging that Chen Zixin, a fellow villager and cotton merchant, was also suspected of inciting the murder of her husband and requested an investigation. The details were briefly reported in the newspaper. However, Wu Xiaoshi recently applied to the police station to withdraw the lawsuit against the Chen family in the investigation, and stated that the suspicion against the Chen family was based on rumors. She only learned after returning to her hometown to sweep the tombs that another person was inciting the murder of her husband and that it had nothing to do with the Chen family. The police station considered that Wu Xiaoshi should not renege on the human life case, fabricate facts, and falsely accuse good people. However, considering that women are ignorant, she was reprimanded once and allowed to withdraw the lawsuit. The principal offender Yang Longsheng was detained, and the instigator Yang Lingsheng was arrested and investigated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Shanghai Searched a Sauce Garden - Confiscated Kerosene, Candles, Etc.</h3>

The situation at the time was extremely serious, and residents who did not know the truth were greatly alarmed. It was then learned that the Japanese military police were searching the Chengchang store attached to the Wanshun Sauce Garden. At that time, more than 600 boxes of Asia kerosene and more than 200 boxes of Price's candles were confiscated and transported away by the Japanese. The owner of the store, Shi Wanyao, had fled after hearing the news in advance. It is reported that the confiscated goods were hoarded by Shi and others and intended to be sold at a good price. Unexpectedly, it was discovered by the Japanese side, who thought it violated Japanese regulations, so they investigated, confiscated, and seized them.</p>
<h3>Defu Bank Robbery Case - Continuing to Apprehend Major Criminals</h3>

<h3>Family and School</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Most parents send their children to school, and then entrust all the responsibility of teaching to the teachers. If their children's grades are poor and their character is inferior, they blame it on the teacher's negligence. What a big mistake that is!</p>
<p>Parents must first know that school can enable a child who is illiterate to gradually progress from recognizing simple characters to being able to read various picture books and write long essays. It can also enable a child who is tottering to be trained into a strong physique. It can also enable a child who does not understand human affairs to be filled with rich knowledge. Moreover, it can make a child who needs help in everything have proficient management skills. However, in students' studies, work, actions, and behavior, everyone's differences are revealed everywhere (in addition to differences in intelligence). Some are arrogant and perverse, some are humble and gentle, some are stubborn, some are withdrawn, some like to be alone, some like to be gregarious, some are diligent, some are lazy, some are chivalrous, some are very selfish, some are暴跺, some are patient. Although schools use various methods such as storytelling, gatherings, speeches, and performances to try to change children's character, despite talking about honesty, things are still stolen among classmates; despite promoting diligence and assigning students to take turns doing duties, a child who is lazy by nature may do very well in front of the teacher, but at home he is not happy to do anything regardless of whether there is anything to do. There are countless facts that can be cited as examples of such contradictory actions. Therefore, the transfer of character cannot be achieved by school education alone.</p>
<p>Why are children's characters different? Why are they so deeply rooted that they cannot be changed? The first question can be answered according to the different family environments in which each child grows up. The second question has several causes: (1) Children spend more time at home; a five-year-old child has five years at home before he enters school. At home, he comes into contact with his parents and siblings. He imitates everyone's actions, whether good or bad. He even knows very well who is the best and loves him the most. If his mother dotes on him, he will be willful, indulgent, and blackmailing. Other bad qualities are also developed as a result. Because of the long period and the impression at the beginning of his life, a very solid foundation is laid. After he enters school, he still has many opportunities to contact his family, and his character is not easy to change. (2) Teachers are busy with work, and there are many students. Teachers cannot take care of every child. In addition to teaching the text, teachers also have to handle school affairs, grade papers, and deal with children's disputes. They no longer have the energy to persuade children one by one and reform their bad habits. In addition, they rarely have contact with children outside of class, so there is no emotion like between family members, so that children have a sense of awe towards teachers and dare not approach them, thinking that being called to the office by the teacher is always to be punished, and they do not have the desire to improve themselves.</p>
<p>If we want school education to achieve great results and exert great power, the family and the school must be linked together and become one. Parents should not push the responsibility onto the teachers. From the time the child is born, they must assume the responsibility of both teaching and raising, laying the foundation for good character and habits. Then, school education can complement each other, so as to enable every child to develop healthily in all aspects! In the future, they will be able to undertake all major tasks.</p>
<h3>Some Experiences Gained from Reading Chinese</h3>
<p>— Little Reader Qin</p>
<p>Little friends: Chinese is the language of our country. The period of contact is of course longer than other languages. Even common sense has to be transformed from Chinese. Therefore, the experiences we get from reading Chinese are also more than those from other languages.</p>
<p>However, I don't have much experience, but I just unconsciously discovered that it is essential to read in this way. Speaking of experience, this can be considered my experience.</p>
<p>I have gained a few reading methods from pressure-fueled experiments. For example, when reading vernacular Chinese, the tone of reading must be like speaking. As long as you can understand it when you listen to it, then you can naturally comprehend the general idea and content of the book: when reading classical Chinese, don't read it like speaking, but read it more. By reading it more, you will naturally understand the explanation of each sentence. Once, I was reading a classical Chinese text that I had to memorize. At first, the sentences in the book were inexplicable, but after reading it until I could recite it, I was able to understand the explanation in the middle. I myself don't know how this is possible, but the actual experiment is like this. One</p>
<p>To memorize a lesson, you must first memorize it in sections; then read the entire article several times, and it will be easy to memorize. (If you encounter a passage that is too long, divide it and read it again yourself), because the number of words in the sections is small, it is easy to remember. Reading the entire article several times can connect the words in the sections, but the most important thing is that your attention must not be distracted.</p>
<p>When reading or reading a book, you must deeply visualize the facts written in the book before your eyes, and imagine yourself in the situation. When you are writing, think about whether the beginning and ending of the article can be the same as a certain article. Comparing the two, you can apply it.</p>
<h3>Raising Silkworms</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Once the Qingming Festival has passed, families that raise silkworms begin their work. Jing’er saw that raising silkworms was interesting, so he asked his classmate for some silkworm eggs to raise himself. He had never raised silkworms before and had no experience, but he knew that his mother had raised them before. So, he quickly ran to ask her. His mother said, “You want to raise silkworms? Then listen.” Jing’er listened attentively.</p>
<p>What is the method for raising silkworms? First, place the silkworm eggs in a warm place so that the silkworms hatch into ant-like larvae. Then, gently brush them off the paper with a feather, or turn the paper over to make the silkworms fall off. Then, finely chop mulberry leaves for them to eat. The silkworms will grow slowly. After the second or third sleep, you can feed them whole leaves. This must be done at regular intervals without prolonged breaks. The mulberry leaf debris and silkworm droppings must be removed. After the second or third sleep, clean them every day. After the fourth sleep, the silkworms’ bodies become transparent, and they nod their heads upward, indicating they are ready to spin cocoons. Aren’t the cocoons beautiful? They come in many colors. Once the cocoons are made, use heat to kill the pupae inside so that the silk can be reeled. Silk has so many uses! It is a common and important raw material for making clothes. After listening, Jing’er asked, “Can the mulberry leaves be damp?” His mother said, “No, the mulberry leaves must be clean, otherwise they will be harmful to the silkworms.” Jing’er listened very carefully and happily ran off to start his work.</p>
<h3>Basic Knowledge of Sowing Seeds</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Ah Hui’s father was quite fond of gardening. Before the war, there were many flowers in his hometown garden, red and green, truly splendid. However, since fleeing to Shanghai, he has been living in such a small house that the matter of growing flowers has been put aside. But sometimes, taking advantage of his Sunday holiday, he would often take Ah Hui to the park for a stroll. One day, it suddenly sparked his interest in growing flowers again.</p>
<p>Now is the bright and sunny time of spring. After finishing work, his father suddenly happily bought several packets of flower seeds, intending to sow them himself. This aroused Ah Hui’s curiosity. What do these flower seeds look like? Moreover, the flower seed packets are printed with colorful flowers, which are very beautiful. The names of the flowers are noted next to them. Ah Hui looked at them, puzzled. When he opened the flower seed packets, he looked inside and only saw flower seeds that looked like sesame seeds. "Can these flower seeds sprout and bloom?" he asked his father.</p>
<p>"You see these flower seeds, they seem dead, with no vitality at all, but that's not true. They also have respiration. They breathe just like lively flowers, even like us, but the respiration of seeds is very slow. It's best to scatter the seeds now, as they will germinate more quickly!"</p>
<p>"Dad, then why must seeds be scattered in the spring? Can't they be sown in the winter?" Ah Hui asked in succession.</p>
<p>"You need to know that seeds need three conditions to germinate: first, moisture; second, temperature; and third, oxygen. In winter, the temperature will not reach the temperature required for seed germination, so seeds sown at that time will certainly not sprout. You must wait for spring to arrive, when the climate gradually warms up, and the moisture contained in the soil gradually evaporates due to the warmth. Because moisture evaporates from the soil, oxygen can easily enter the soil. The seeds in the soil originally contain moisture. Moreover, the temperature has now increased, and there is also oxygen available for the seeds to absorb. All three of these conditions are met in spring, so they germinate easily. Before we sow the seeds, we must loosen the soil, and then scatter the seeds. Otherwise, how can the tender sprouts push through the surface of the hard soil? After the seeds are scattered, some seeds will germinate after about a week. At that time, you can distinguish which family of plants the seed belongs to. Because plants can roughly be divided into dicotyledonous plants and monocotyledonous plants. Therefore, after germination, the first cotyledons will appear. If there are two cotyledons, then you can determine that the plant is a dicotyledonous plant. If there is only one, it is called a monocotyledonous plant." Ah Hui's father paused here, and then went to scatter the seeds in the flower pot, adding a thin layer of soil on top of the seeds, then watered them, and then waited for the seeds to germinate.</p>
<h3>The Paper Hiding Fire and the Paper Wrapping Wind</h3>
<p>— Duan Fang</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, after Ying'er and Ming'er, brother and sister, finished their homework, they asked their father to take them to see a movie. Their father smiled and said:</p>
<p>"That would be nice, but I want each of you to get me something."</p>
<p>Ming'er, being impatient, couldn't wait for his father to finish speaking and shouted, "Okay! Okay! Tell us quickly what to get?"</p>
<p>Dad first said to Ying'er, "Get me a paper hiding fire."</p>
<p>Then he said to Ming'er, "Get me a paper wrapping wind."</p>
<p>The poor siblings were stunned by their father's words. They looked at each other, unable to say a word. Eventually, Ying'er, being more perceptive and two years older than Ming'er, thought for a moment and said, "I've got it! I've got it!" She ran into the storage room, three steps at a time, and took out a lantern that they lit during the New Year, lit a candle, and gave it to her father:</p>
<p>"Isn't this paper hiding fire?" Ying'er said triumphantly.</p>
<p>"That's right, you can see a movie today."</p>
<p>At this time, Ming'er became even more anxious, and quickly shed two tears. His father saw him crying, then took out a folding fan from the drawer and said to Ming'er:</p>
<p>"Isn't this what I asked you to get? When you fan a fan, doesn't it create wind? So I'm telling you, often a very easy thing seems very difficult on the outside, but as long as you think about it carefully, you can solve it immediately. Crying won't help you. It's already late, let's go see a movie together!"</p>
<p>In this way, Ming'er turned sorrow into joy, and from then on, whenever he encountered difficult things, he always thought carefully and never cried again.</p>
<h3>Striving Upward</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cheng</p>
<p>Since reading Miss Ding's "A Solitary Child's Confession" in the 13th issue of this publication, I have shed many tears.</p>
<p>I also like being quiet and love gazing at the moon from the window at midnight, silently grieving. Even during the day, I would sit blankly at my desk, motionless, not doing my homework, just muddling through. Therefore, I was often scolded by teachers at school and looked down upon by my family at home, but I still seemed to be indifferent, not wanting to strive upward at all.</p>
<p>But since reading Miss Ding's article, seeing her courageous attitude, I felt somewhat ashamed and realized that my strange temper was wrong. I am a master of the Republic of China, and I will contribute to the Republic of China, I will bring blessings to humanity. China and even the world need people like us so much!</p>
<p>So, I started to work hard in earnest. Every day I do the homework I should be doing, and every night I do beneficial physical games with my older brother, second brother, and younger brother, because "a strong mind needs a strong body." At the same time, I also try to make myself happy often.</p>
<p>I know that there are many children who are also behaving like I used to, and I hope that these children, after reading my article, will quickly learn to do as I do (although my actions may not be perfect). If my hope can come true, then we will be able to see progress in our studies in the near future.</p>

<h3>"Letter from an Unknown Woman" Star Bette Davis and Three Directors</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ji</p>
<p>The movie magazine Oregonian recently published an interview with Bette Davis. Reporters pressed her to talk about acting because someone was spreading rumors that her acting had greatly declined. Bette Davis, however, was quite playful. She said, "Whenever I want to further improve my acting, I admire three famous directors in Hollywood. I can improve my acting by watching the performances of actors in their films."</p>
<p>It turns out that the "suffering" star Bette Davis admires is John Ford, William Dieterle, and Edmund Goulding. John Ford directed such blockbusters as "The Informer", "The Hurricane", "Young Mr. Lincoln", "The Grapes of Wrath", "The Long Voyage Home" (which has not yet been released in Shanghai), and has won the Academy Award for Best Director twice. William Dieterle is a quirky Hollywood biopic director. such as "The Story of Louis Pasteur", "The Life of Emile Zola", and "Juarez". Edmund Goulding is a quirky Hollywood director of tearjerkers, such as "Dark Victory", "The Old Maid", "The Great Lie", and "The Constant Nymph". Bette Davis always asked him to direct when she starred in tearjerkers.</p>
<p>These three directors are the ones Bette admires most, because under their direction, actors can fully express their characteristics and benefit greatly.</p>
<p>"Ford is very good at capturing the atmosphere, the audience often feels suffocated, and the content of the film is very meaningful. Starring in a Ford-directed film is very tiring.</p>
<p>"In Dieterle's biographical films, the actors can fully express their acting skills. He is an experienced craftsman, and actors can improve their acting skills.</p>
<p>"Goulding pays great attention to the tragic tone, and the actors should cooperate with this step and action, so they can often get his instructions."</p>
<p>The above are the reasons why Bette Davis admires these three great directors. Therefore, seeing her seek advice and learn from great directors shows how eager she is to improve her acting skills.</p>
<p>Bette Davis most sincerely told reporters: "Please watch the two films "Letter from an Unknown Woman" and "Bride Came C.O.D." and then verify me, I also sincerely hope to get guidance from others."</p>
<p>Bette has won the Academy Award twice for starring in "Dangerous" and "Jezebel". Her exquisite and profound acting skills have long been admired. Shanghai will soon screen her recent work "Letter from an Unknown Woman". Movie fans can go and judge whether her acting has declined compared to before.</p>
<h3>Talking About Lianhuan Tao (The Chain of Interlocking Manoeuvres)</h3>
<p>— Chen Yongxi</p>
<p>The play *Lianhuan Tao* has been one of the most popular plays in the north and south in recent years. The plot is as follows: At the Heroes' Gathering, Huang Santai, also known as Er'erdun, turns against them and resorts to violence. At this time, Santai is old and weak, while Dou Erdun is full of vigor. Therefore, Santai stealthily throws a dart at him. After being injured, Dou is ashamed and indignant and hides in Lianhuan Tao, vowing to avenge the dart. Decades later, Emperor Kangxi bestows a famous horse to Liang Jiugong. Dou then steals the horse to frame Santai. By this time, Santai has passed away, so his son, Tianba, is held responsible for his crime. Helplessly, Tianba colludes with his colleague Zhu Guangzu and has Guan Tai and He Lutong impersonate鏢客, to search everywhere. They pass through Lianhuan Tao, where the headmen attempt to劫, Tianba captures and releases them, instead going to pay respects at the mountain, and learns that the禦　 is indeed in the寨. He also explains that he is a descendant of Santai. Dou, not wanting to take advantage of numbers, sends them out of the寨, deciding to have a武 at the foot of the mountain on a certain day. That night, Zhu Guangzu sneaks into the寨, stealing钩 插 刀in Tianba's name. On the day of the武, Guangzu reproaches him with righteousness. Dou is moved, and so offers the御馬 to the government to take the punishment. Tianba desperately protects him, sparing him from death, and Dou eventually converts to佛鬥. In this play,武生 (Huang Tianba) and 花臉 (Lai Erdun) are central, while 武丑 (Zhu Guangzu) is the宾. After Tian Shuang's 天霜 and Bai Yang's 白楊 小樓 passed away, 後　 were played by Zhou 　 中 Gao Shenglin 高盛麟, Liu Zongyang 劉宗揚, Li Wanchun 李萬春 and Wu Yanheng 吳彥衡. Zongyang 劉宗揚 was personally taught by Yang's 楊, so his, smile, captured Yang's 楊 flavor. Also, this 天霜角 has sometimes been played by 老生 actors. When Ma Lianliang 馬連良 first decided to抵滬, he played this role. Now, both Guan Shengxi 貫盛習 and Ye Shichang 葉世長 have also played it. The Dou Erdun 竇爾墩 character, in those days, was paired with Yang 楊 by Hao Shouchun 郝壽臣. Hao had a short, fat build, but his ferocity was unmatched. In terms of 身段 and 神情, Hou Xirui 侯喜瑞 was the best. Jin Shaoshan 金少山 only excelled in terms of vigor and嗓音. Ji Chunheng 季春恒 and Liu Yanting 劉硯亭 were also not weak. In later generations, Yuan Shihai 袁世海 first imitated Hou and then Hao, and also had a foundation of early功, so he played this角色 superbly. Qiu Shengrong 裘盛戎, apart from his annoying nasal音, was also acceptable to watch. Zhu Guangzu 朱光祖, after Wang Changlin 王長林 passed away, Ye Shengzhang's 葉盛章武工柔術, though the best among the　辈, had a mouthful of拌豆腐, reducing the performance's brilliance considerably. Wang Fushan 王福山 is Changlin's 長林 child, but he relied on his age, and was not as good as Ai Shiju 艾世菊. The south rarely plays this play, because southern 武生 actors lack a strong 嗓 able to sing, and there is no好的花臉. Carlton 噶爾登 Qilintong 麒麟童 (playing Huang Tianba 黃天霸) and Gao Baisui 高百歲 (playing Dou Erdun 竇爾墩) have played this, but it was a 反串 nature. Huang Jincheng 黃金程 Shao Yu's 少餘 Bao Erdun 寶爾墩 often used炸音. However, Miao Shengchun 苗勝春飾朱先祖, in addition to his martial arts skill, his神氣 and白口 were excellent. Although Zhang Delu 張德祿 was proficient in武生, he liked to串演武丑, so he could also play this role. Zhao Ruquan 趙如泉 playing Lianhuan Tao, first as Tianba and then Guangzu, is quite胡鬧.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Society Opera Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Society Opera House celebrates its first anniversary today. In addition to publishing a special issue, the society will host guests from all walks of life at its premises at No. 79, Race Course Road, at 10:00 AM. The performance will begin at 1:00 PM at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. The evening program will feature Lianhuan Tao starring Tang Ruyao and Zhang Boren, and the entire opera Fishermen's Revenge by Zhang Wenan and Zhang Ruihong, among others.</p>
<h3>Remembering Shen Xiling</h3>
<p>— Wu Chen</p>
<p>The death of Mr. Shen Xiling is a loss to Chinese art amidst the hardships of rebirth. Everyone, whether they knew Mr. Shen or not, would think so. Therefore, expressing a little sorrow and a little mourning for the death of this tenacious and hardworking artist is "a matter beyond discussion."</p>
<p>In terms of personal friendship, Mr. Xiling and I did not have deep interactions. I only met him a few times. I remember one time was in his elder sister's office, because we were both busy, we didn't have long conversations, which I still regret. In terms of public friendship, I admire his fighting spirit, sympathize with his fighting environment, and pity his fighting methods. In the Chinese art world, there are many "sitting back and enjoying the fruits of labor" or "achieving twice the result with half the effort" clever artists. But for Xiling, it was the opposite. The "results" he obtained were achieved with three times, four times, or even ten times the blood, sweat, and effort. Some people say he is "weak." This seems to be "sympathy," but is actually a "smug" and "mocking" criticism.</p>
<p>I deeply agree with staging a stage play adapted from Mr. Xiling's representative work "Crossroads" as one way to commemorate him. It is most appropriate that this work is done by Mr. Lu Si, who has a deep friendship and understanding of Xiling and has excellent cultivation and experience in theatrical arts. What's strange is that the responsibility of directing has fallen on my shoulders, which is, to be honest, an unexpected and painful task.</p>
<p>The success of "Crossroads" is not accidental. True art does not have "lucky breaks." The original work combines a serious theme, lighthearted performance, lively editing and directing techniques, and superb acting to form a rare masterpiece in the Chinese art world. If we do not have Mr. Xiling's hardworking spirit, serious attitude, and considerable certainty to talk about commemorating Shen Xiling, it would not only be an insult to Mr. Xiling but also an insult to myself.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the Tianfeng authorities asked me to direct "Crossroads," I accepted it under circumstances where I had no choice. I always feel like I am committing a crime. I feel like I am taking a sharp knife and dismembering the honorary garments crystallized from Mr. Shen Xiling's hard work and perseverance. During the day I think about it, at night I dream about how to reduce my guilt and how to cause less damage to Mr. Xiling's garments. In this helpless situation, I can only hope for "rehearsal, rehearsal, and more rehearsal!"</p>
<p>I am grateful to the many enthusiastic young audiences who have great expectations for this performance. Many have also written to me, instructing me not to damage the spirit of the original work. Every instruction is like a needle pricking me, making me sweat profusely.</p>
<h3>Jade Blossoms in a Bloody Rain</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Besieging Cities and Slaughtering Generals</p>
<p>Li Xin pointed his knife at Fatty Fang and scolded, "You treacherous slave! I have treated you well all these days. Even if I have reprimanded you a little, you should not hold a grudge in your heart. Your injury the other day was your own fault. How dare you falsely accuse me of colluding with bandits in front of the Magistrate of Qi County, causing me to be imprisoned, forcing my wife to death, and hurting Heaven and reason, you dog! You slave, you beast, do you still have a human heart? I want to see how black your heart is!" He raised his knife and stabbed straight into Fatty Fang's heart. With just one stir, he had already gouged out a bloody heart. Guiqiu was so frightened that she covered her face with both hands and fell to the ground. Li Xin looked at her and scolded, "You lewd woman, I will not spare you either!" With a wave of the white blade, Guiqiu's head was already separated from her body. Seeing that Li Xin had dealt with the pair of dog men and women, Red Maiden said from the side, "Your wife is dead, your family fortune is exhausted, there is nothing to miss anymore. Quickly come back to Qing Stone Mountain with me, so that the government soldiers will not track you down here." Li Xin nodded, sighed deeply, turned around and walked down the stairs with Red Maiden, walked out of the village gate, and looked back at his own village again, only sighing. The Qing Stone Mountain's men had already led over their mounts. Red Maiden first jumped onto her red-maned horse. Li Xin had no choice but to follow and mount his horse, and left Qi County with Red Maiden and his party, heading towards Qing Stone Mountain. Li Xin's returning to the old place was something he never expected. His heart was filled with emotion, both sadness and joy. Tong Tianbao had already returned and welcomed Li Xin up the mountain, and ordered the kitchen to prepare wine and delicacies to welcome Li Xin, and the brother and sister accompanied him to sit together. Li Xin, thinking of the私　 of the other day, felt very ashamed. Raising his wine cup, he thanked the Tong siblings and said, "Li Xin, because of his longing for his乡, left the mountain without saying goodbye the other day. Returning to Qi County, unfortunately he was framed by a villain, and the corrupt official maliciously accused him, suffering the misfortune of being imprisoned, and nearly dying at the hands of the贼子. Thanks to the righteous rescue of the virtuous siblings, this kindness and virtue can truly be said to be bringing the dead back to life. This time directly going up the mountain寨, I only feel extremely ashamed." Tong Tianbao said, "Li 爷, do not say such things. As long as you appreciate my sister's true heart and enthusiasm, and are no longer indecisive, and settle here to work together for a great cause, that would be the greatest happiness for both of us siblings." Red Maiden did not speak, silently only gazing intently at Li Xin with a pair of watery and charming eyes. Li Xin felt guilty inside, feeling that his behavior was very unfair to her. He then said, "I am grateful to the virtuous siblings for not abandoning me, and I will certainly follow you closely and work together." Tong Tianbao said "Good!". He raised the large goblet and drank wildly. They also talked about the situation in Qi County and the general situation in the world before they dispersed. That night, Tong Tianbao　sent Li Xin to his sister's room. Li Xin, arriving at this place, hesitated to enter, and his mouth stammered. In the light of the華 lamp, he saw Red Maiden wearing a茜 color nightgown, sitting with her back to the lamp, her posture graceful, 万孌 万方, without any of the valiant air. (Four Nine)</p>
