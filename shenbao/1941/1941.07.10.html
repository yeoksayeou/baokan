<h3>日對外貿易一落千丈　刻正尋求新市塲尤注意荷印越南</h3>
<p>合衆社九日束京電　據日本商界之意見、日政府預知美、日國易勢將受現時戰爭之重大影響、故刻正尋求新的市塲、以代替日趨不振之美國市塲、官方界尋覓新市塲者、大都注目於印度南作中國及越南、日本縮小出口市塲之事、在東京及橫濱之日商店中、已有證明、日本以前專為出口而製造之物品今己可在本國購得、然日本商界談稱、美、日聞貿易現尙無十分令人不滿之處、惟彼等已知美政府有對進口日貨施以嚴厲限制之趨向、一般人之意見皆認為、此種限制將日趨嚴峻、日人頗企圖在中南美洲發展日貨市塲、惟一般國易雜誌對此均不表過度之興奮、至言日本欲思向南美洲購買美政府己不願資日之貨物、尤屬非易、美國在南美洲之購客、所出之價格、較日人所肯出者、超出良多、因此政府專家巳起草一獲取新原料之程序、準備傾全力在「共榮區」中尤其在中國及越南取得一切所需之原料、日本最近向印屬東印度提出之經濟要求雖歸失敗、惟衆信日本終將在最適當之機會內、重作要求、法、日當局已完成一新的經濟談判、日本自此可在越南獲得較前更大之開發利益、日本並續與蘇聯作國易談判、以增進兩國之貿易、惟此項談判已因蘇、德戰爭而感到搖擺不定、蘇、日最新之三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇日圓貿易協定、迄未批准、惟日本官吏已表示、日本迄未放棄此約、自蘇、德爆發、使德、日路綫之西伯利亞切斷後、日本在歐洲僅有之市塲亦告消失、日本在歐洲、西半球及南美洲國易傾跌之結果、千百日僑失業回國、每一來自美國及南太平洋尤其澳洲、菲島、新加坡之輪船、均載來大批日人、數目且有增無已、</p>

<p>路透社九日西貢電　法當局承認關於根據經濟協定條款、將食米交付日本事、巳發生困難情形、但並不引起信義問題、因規定每年之總數為七十萬噸、而在五個月內已運交四十萬噸也、食米輸出最近每月逾十萬噸、在西　市塲中實屬空前、故認東京各報之攻擊、未免不公、據稱目前之耕鋤時季、將至九月為止、本年收成原佔計常在一百四十萬噸左右、但因大水及其他原因、似未必超過一百十萬噸、據正式米市報告、各麪粉廠均因缺乏穀類、均停止工作、政府現正採取步驟、越督曾以宮方食米委員會名義發布命令、由該委會按規定價目所有食米出售於日本、一切存貨逾五噸者、皆須是報、囤積者處重罰、據越方官員辯稱、所有協定內規定之其他貨物、均經按時交付、彼等又謂不知有日本以壓力加諸越南政府情事、並對於上海方面所傳日本有南進可能性之消息、不予置信、日總領事蓑田曾語往訪記者云、現已引起若干技術上之困難、惟日本尙未採取正式步驟、越南政府之應遵照協定條款交付貨物、乃屬其責任云、</p>

<p>美軍實行接管氷島，美國的國防綫實際上已超出一般所認為的西半球範圍以外。這其實不過是新行動的第一步，羅斯福總統隔昨談話中所提及在西半球以外有關保衛美洲任務的其他幾個地點，也許要比較氷島距離美洲更遠，同時也就是要更進一步的接觸到歐戰的外緣。這自然是一個積極的非常措施，但如因此而認為美國即將參戰的見解則並不見得正確，因為就目前而言，美國之是吾參戰，主要視乎蘇聯能否遏阻納粹攻勢，同時也就要看英美蘇聯之聯合陣綫是否有迅速積極的展開；而在軸心方面，在攻蘇戰事並未順利發展的現在，對於另一最大強國，無論在心理上或實際上，都不會公然採取敵對行動的。</p>
<p>連日美國輿論，對於出兵佔領氷島一舉幾乎一致赞美，並且討論到更進一步的步驟，這可見羅斯福總統之運用統帥權力在西半球以外非美國領土的地方有所行動，無形中是受着輿論的鼓勵，同時也就可見美國參戰情緒之更形成熟。從二十年前威爾遜自歐戰和會鎩羽歸國之日起，美國的對外政策幾乎無日不受孤立主義的牽制，而尤以最近十年間為尤甚。然而隨着侵略罪惡之因遭放縱而益形鵬張，美國朝野反孤立的奮鬥也就愈加激昂，到最近，有如惠勒林白之流雖仍固守殘壘，却業已失掉原有的聲勢和號召力。美當局前日這一步驟，應該認為是美國歷史上衝破孤立牽制而採取斷然行動的重要一頁。</p>
<p>美總統前日談話之拒絕明白厘定東西半球的界綫，可見他已不為前此美國傳統的保守觀念所拘囿，不過其目前所注意的重心顯然還在大西洋。這大概因為德國正在竭全力從事攻蘇，無暇而且無力顧到海上的進退，而並非由於美國實際上已在大西洋方面感到了更嚴重的威脅。就現實的情况來觀察：蘇聯的英勇抗戰與英國的海上覇權都是美國東部國防的有力保障，而且德國雖擁有精銳空軍，但却缺乏强大艦隊在海上合作，其所能加於美國的威脅，較之美國西境和阿拉斯加之直接暴露於世界第三位海軍之下者誠不可同日而語。美總統隔昨談話中之提及對於夏成夷阿拉斯加防禦力的影響問題，尤其是美海軍主力之始終留駐在珍珠港，足以證明美當局絕不是對於太平洋有所忽視，但若就其最近對於兩洋的關切和措施而論，則顯然是對於歐局更形積極。</p>
<p>衡以美國一貫的政策傳統，綏靖政策之類應不致滲入到美當局的對外運用當中，但其最近對於遠東之欠缺警惕和積極，實不免引起若干人士的疑念。自從蘇德戰爭爆發，遠東戰事顯已與歐戰相合流，即在對日本較比美國更形接近的蘇聯，最近在斯達林的演說中亦復如此確認，則在一向固守反侵略立塲的民治國家，更不當歐亞雙方戰事之間有所軒輊。以目前形勢言，自然是歐戰規模較大，對於世界的影響也更嚴重，但遠東戰局却始終不失為其中重要的一環。在此種局勢中採取沉機觀變態度者絕不是靜止無所事事，而是窺伺着最有利的行動時機；昨天由東京傳來的消息，表示着英國此後的行動，將視三國公約之眞正實施情形，而決定英國之態度，這種消息也許不盡可靠，但，又將由主動變成被動，其眞實意義則為遠東危險性的又形提高。</p>
<p>就目前國際形勢看來；納粹對蘇閃電戰之絕未奏效，其聲勢以至實力都已有嚴重的挫折，因之也就增加了英美擊潰納粹的便利，以是美國之佔領冰島並考慮更進一步的行動，雖然賢明，但其未能以同樣積極措施用於遠東，則顯為重大遺憾。假如北進而當眞實現，首當其衝者固然是海參崴，但卻會立刻危及阿留申羣島和阿拉斯加，而且日前所傳的安全區建議，更是一件極可重視的事。戰爭之更向太平洋擴大自然不是幸事，而把太平洋的安全寄託在侵略者的善意上面，卻更是一個重大的危險。</p>

<p>路透社九日倫致電　蘇聯前任外委長李維諾夫昨夜從莫斯科廣播、促請英蘇兩國對希特勒同施不斷不懈的打擊、謂德蘇戰爭巳迫使希特勒調其軍隊源源從西至東、乃使英國人民於遭遇十二個月之不斷轟炸後、得稍休息、但希特勒顯巳誤算其對蘇所施打擊之性質、蘇德兩國曾訂互不侵犯條約、而由希特勒本人所發嚴莊宣言予以認可、今納粹德國竟背信攻擊和平的蘇聯、此事已予世人以新的絕大證據、證明納粹制度與希特勒主義長此存在、任何國家無論其政策如何、俱未能感覺安全、希特勒及其左右所訂之協定與義務、所發之諾言或保證、以及中立宜言或任何關係、皆不能為免遭其突然無端進攻之保障、而媾和亦不能為不遭其隨時重施攻擊之保護、希特勒之主要目的、厥為對於敵對國家各個擊破、此即吾人應協力同施不斷打擊之理山、目下每一打擊、較諸日後所施者功效相同、而費用與犧牲則大减、吾人不已從希特勒等所著文字與所發言論者獲知希特勒自以為不屑重視國家和平共存與國際義務道德之一切觀念乎、希特勒在其自傳中、已自述在國際和平十年時期中渠感覺如何憔悴而失望矣、不有戰爭　不能見生活之道、田野染血、、城市成墟、飢困交迫、母妻流淚、此皆為希特勒感覺愉快安慰之元素、蘇聯政府首知納粹侵略及於世界之危機、曾請各國協力制之、合謀拒之、呼籲屢作，而響應卒鮮、此中原因、今日言之巳非其時、迨屋旣着火、則當務之急厥在救火、至於何以不先事預防、何人應負其職、祇可於事後研究之、歐洲今在火焰中、、而其他各處亦有一部分如是國家之獨立被剝削、土地被蹂躪、如蝗蟲過境然、人民被壓迫如奴隸然者今已多矣、其少數國家今在中立與對德友誼不侵犯公的之虛幻掩護下、猶掙扎一種破爛的獨立生存者、又安知其不於短時期內遭受此同樣命運乎、英國與其自治領得美國之積極援助、會當希特勒與其龐大戰爭機構為六年備戰的結果者之銜、而與之奮鬥、今此奮鬥又臨於蘇聯、對於共同仇敵抗戰到底、乃蘇聯當前之唯一責任、希特勒在其攻擊他國、以期實現其宰割世界的迷夢之獰惡計畫中、素秉「分而擊之」之原則、渠用極陰狠方法、使被侵略者、不能紙織共同之反抗、而堅於歐洲較强之國、尤注重避免兩陣綫之同時戰爭、納粹戰略在擇定其犧牲品、而一一依照環境擊倒之、渠本擬先解決西方諸國、而後可自由轉向蘇聯、但未能盡如其願、以遇有阻力故也、希特勒尙未作海峽　　游泳家之訓練、故共腦海中另籌一策、以為渠在西方巳獲有事實上之休戰、不妨改在東方施展其閃電戰、然後再以全力西撲英倫而滅之、同時希特勒希望以思想上之差異離間東西、俾免東西同時夾攻德國、但希特勒對於在東綫打擊之閃電性質與在東思想上宣傳之神秘威力皆計算錯誤、、蓋英相邱吉爾已於德國向蘇施攻之日、即以其素具之政治家見識昭告世界、決不為希特勒狡計所紿、而聲明希特勒之戰勝蘇聯、將使英國受莫可計算之慘禍矣、在蘇聯方面亦知希特勒在西勝利所將給予吾人之危害、紅軍現發揚其革命之奇蹟、獨當希特勒全部强大的軍事機構之襲擊、而迫令希特勒陸續調其軍隊由西至東、因此英國人民乃刻稍獲休息、惟事有極關重要者、吾人不可使希特勒有片時喘息、應使希特勒感覺西方事實上休戰未能實現之失望、希特勒以單獨各個擊破為目的　、而吾人則應以同時打擊不稍停懈為目的、目前每一打擊其效力較諸日後在任何一個抗戰國力量挫弱時所施之打擊强及十倍、而費用與犧牲亦可大减、蘇聯與英國刻皆為保持其國家之完整與獨立、以免為人奴隸而戰、裝方共同之勝利、可使目前呻吟於希特勒殘忍踐踏的鐵蹄下之民衆得獲解放、而開關依照各解放國願望、組織更好的生活之新途徑、蓋希特勒主義之毀亡將為現代最可恥的現象之銷滅、與妨害固有文明發展的最大阻力之剗除也、蘇英兩國人民固仍有種種艱辛苦惱與暫時頓挫之失望、然可無疑者、蘇英人民知其對於歷史對於人類而負之責任、定將竭盡其力以實踐其所負之歷史上責任、蘇聯人民今已以熱烈精神、應蘇聯政府元首即吾人今袖斯達林同志之呼籲、億兆健兒一致奮起、保衛祖國而抱會同其他享有自由與嗜愛自由的人民繼續奮鬥、直至法西斯野蠻絕跡於地球而後已之堅强決心云、</p>

<h3>蔣委長吿全國軍民書　內容訓示三要點　一致精誠團結提高戰鬥力量發揚民族精神樹立復興基礎把握建國重點完成革命大業</h3>
<p>重慶六日電　蔣委員長於抗建第四周年紀念日發表吿全國軍民書、原文錄次、全國將士和同胞們、我們神聖的抗建、到今天已第四年了、最近世界局勢有迅速明朗的發展、我們遭逢這樣千載難遇的大時代、得以盡我們民族的力量、對世界有所貢獻、實在是人生之至幸、我們抗建的事業是艱重的、我們的前途是光明的、我們的精神更是崇高而純潔的、今天世界上侵略國家與反侵略國家、已形成顯然分明的兩大分野、軸心國家的侵略範圍、在歐洲與亞洲同時擴大、一切愛好自由的友邦、為着保衛共同正義與人類文明、很自然的站在一條綫上了、我常說、「我們作戰必須在世界整個局勢發展中盡到我們的責任、乃能求得最後勝利、達到眞正的成功」、縱觀這一年來的國際變化、所有侵略暴力的罪惡陰謀充分揭露、反侵略的力量合作加强這種種變化、都是應着我們的預期、現在我們與太平洋有關各友邦分擔責任、互助合作、這種開朗分明的形勢、決不是憑空而至的、我們今天對所有為國犧牲的軍民先烈、應該表示無限的哀敬和愛念、同時我們自身更應該積極努力、來完成他們遺留的使命、日本在政治上經濟上弱點的暴露、巳不待我再加申述了、祇從大處來看、他這一年中勾結德義、成立三國同盟、公布與在所締的條的、宣布「大東亞新秩序」、威脅南洋、橫行無忌、但在南太平洋上、也就在這半年中有美澳荷聯防的成立、在北面、蘇聯始終看透他投機取巧的慣技、沒有一點放棄對他的戒備、自從德國侵蘇戰爭發動以後、他內閣大本營頻頻舉行聯席會議、對外故意支吾、對內百般彌縫、我全國軍民必須知道、今天我們抗建全局的開展、和國際形勢的明朗、都是我們過去四年奮鬥的成果、一切都應我們所預期、我們巳經為世界牽制了日本四年最重要的時間、而愛好自由的各友邦、乃能從容準備以應侵略集團、就這幾點來說、可以說我們抗建的目的已經初步達成、但是我們同時必須警覺、必須戒備、因為天下事往往有功虧一簣、因而事敗垂成的、凡是成功的希望愈近、所潛伏着的失敗和危險的成分就愈多、就世界戰局來說、今天是亞洲的關鍵重於歐洲、我們是亞洲的大國、是東亞戰事的中人、應該積極奮鬥担當起亞洲安危的責任、所以今天我們的責任是更重更大、我要喚起我全國軍民、對本身職責都有嚴肅的自覺、而特別緊要的、是要對下面三點有充分的認識、第一要一致精誠團結、提高戰鬥力量、抗建以來、我們全國的　　信條是「國家至上」、是「勝利第一」今天我們更是進入了一個新的奮鬥階段、世局變化如此嚴重、國家興亡如此飄忽、我們身歷其境、應該切實覺悟、世界上唯有信賴自己尊重自己、然後才能受人家尊重、才能立足於世界、也才能消減侵略、全國同胞特別要知道鞏固國家基礎的重要、國家失其存在、一切都是空虛、民族失其自由、一切都無寄託、我們必須確立民族觀念以整個民族利益為團結的基礎、然後團結纔有力量、勝利纔有把握、我們革命建國本來已有一致的目標、我們應該眞心誠意的來實行三民主義、負起我們時代的使命、第二、要發揚民族精神、樹立復興基礎、我們建國大業必須在作戰之中立定基礎、我以為我們建國、物質的建設當然重要、而精神的建設尤為首要、有了精神、就不息物質建設不能成功、現在我們不但是科學技術落後、物質建設太差、而精神方面、更趕不上時代的需要、所謂精神建設、首先要我們同胞覺悟自身對國家對民族負有神聖的責任和義務、要犧牲一切來負起這個責任、要澈底反省、力求進步、以實行國民的義務、一定要負責任、守紀律、纔可以求得建國的成功、一定要明禮義、知廉恥、纔可以補救巳往種種的缺陷、挽回頹唐因循的風氣、尤其我要提醒我們負行政責任的公務人員、必須痛切感覺自己的責任、瞭然於官吏為人民公僕之大義、絕對做到不溺職不誤事、要對得起國家、對得起人民、而我們同胞也要共同負責守紀、竭盡天職、以確立我們復興民族的根本、同胞們、決不要以為這是尋常告勉的話、要知道我們經過了如此空前未有的犧牲與敎訓、如果還不能澈底覺悟、恢復中華民族固有的精神、不明廉義、不知廉恥、那麼國家不成為國家、民族不成其民族、即使作戰勝利建國也還是要失敗、這就是功虧一簣、我們這一代同胞要成為千秋萬世的罪人、第三、要把握建國重點、完成革命大業、建國工作門類繁多、但最重要的、不外乎軍事敎育和經濟、這是構成現代國家生命力的三大要素、所以我們各級軍事長官、我們敎育界的人士、以及我們從事經濟建設的公務人員技術專家、都是我們建國工作的基礎、戰鬥力量的充實、國家光明前途的開拓、都要由你們負起責任、（未完）</p>

<h3>奇異的上海</h3>
<p>— 弢</p>
<p>日前偶遇着一個闊別十年的同學，他聽我說遊過了西北·西南·和法屬越南，似乎甚感觸地說：「我現在已是四個孩子的父親了，從小生長在上海，身體也從沒有離開過上海一步，將來恐也沒有希望出外去遊一次，你究竟覺得上海怎樣？」</p>
<p>我來上海已五月餘了，心中老覺得忐忑不安，上海究竟是怎樣的一個地方，至今我不敢說，不過她和旁的地方比起來，似乎確有她的奇特之點。</p>
<p>據說在太平天國的時代，老百姓怕「長毛」，就有很多逃難來道尙在荒僻時代的「上海」了，我小的時候，也看見過不少次數許多居在鄕下的親友，因戰事或盜匪而遷居來上海，近十年來，這裹雖也有過戰事，可是在這「奇異的上海」裹，除了偶有炸彈或流彈的傷人外，繁華的都市裹，却是始終繁華着的。</p>
<p>許多外國旅行者，從大洋船上走下，在上海住了幾時，回去就同他的朋友們講：「中國是怎樣的地方，中國人是怎樣的一種人；」還有許多同胞，像我的那位同學一樣，從來沒有離開過這奇特的上海一步，我怕他或許也會以為中國就是像上海一樣，自己的同胞也就像在上海看見的一樣。</p>
<p>其實，上海是奇特的，上海絕不能代表在新興中的中國，來上海看中國的情形，尙不如不來看的為妙！</p>
<p>有人說：上海的文化水準高，我想這或許是的，不過你不能完全這樣說；因為學校多的關係，上海不知有多少大學中學和小學，學生的人數更是可觀，可是我也見着過許多不知桂林貴陽蘭州在何處的大學生：正像前幾日大陸報上一位讀者寫的一樣，他說：上海有許多大學生的頭髮很光亮，西裝很時髦，美國影星的名字背得爛熟，讀書卻祇需混過四年，拿張文憑即行了！我也看見過許多不會用毛筆寫字，甚至連一封家信也寫不通的上海學生，這是因為在這裏，是有許多地方可以不用毛筆或寫中國字的，他們將來一世用不着這些，也就懶得去下功夫了。</p>
<p>在目下的上海，你可看到為各國宣的報紙和電影，你也可讀得來自各方的消息，似乎這裹也可算是「自由的中國」？但是究竟自由與否？我想也沒有人去說明。</p>
<p>「中國事件」（China　Incident）迄今是沒有結束，在自由中國的陪都重慶，日日有着幾小時的空襲警報，人民的生活緊張到極點，上海却還是一個歌舞昇平的太平世界，有些人民的生活也很緊張，可是緊張在金價，滙票，和物價的上落。</p>
<p>在内地曾遇見幾位上海生長的同鄕，他們說：我們走過了漢口·長沙·廣州·重慶·成都·西安·蘭州·貴陽·昆明那一個地方繁華比得上上海，他們在別處人前談起，做上海人似乎是很光榮的，上海眞是一個不能不去一遊的地方，其實，我以為做上海的中國人，也並不比別處的中國人光榮，不過上海確是一個値得一遊的地方，在這十里洋塲之上，要是你高興細細的看看，不愁你會發現許多奇異的特點來。</p>

<h3>糧食　幸有工部局米拋出　米價終難高抬如意</h3>
<p>昨日洋米早市開盤、買氣尙未見衰、蓋承連日漲風、一般投機仍未忘情於騰漲狀態、且公賣港米普遍增加六元、尤為盲從者認為市價應須上漲之理由、而不知米市塲市價連日上漲、早巳加起二三個六元、而港米尙是第一個六元之加價、且加價後叉儘量拋出、拋價一百三十五元零五分及一百三十六元半、又比之市上小絞一百五十四五元低落甚鉅、故一經大批批出、市面立被抑落、市上現小絞降至一百五十三元七八角、期一百五十六元二角至一百五十五元半、暹二號自一百四十八元至一百四十七元、比之前日反小一元許、現米初站繼落、大部份轉居平勢、一部份亦小去數角至一元、收盤行情、一號西貢為百三十三元、百三十二元半、二號高自百廿七元、次至小包百廿二元、二號暹邏高百廿六元、次至百廿三元半、火紋百廿九元、百廿八元半、茄佛米百三十元、敏黨百三十五元至百三十四元牛、小紋百廿八元次至百廿六元、碎尖高自九十九元、次至九十六元半、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、南港新鮮早晚稻、自連朝轟高後、搬運者因頗可獲利、頓覺興奮、到貨突見轉旺、但物稀為貴、貨多則賤、貨主售心旣鬆、而本鄕店舖作客亦不虞向隅、納意亦陡淡、一時供過於求、行情處高難持、立見回貶二元有奇、計開價除特別新鮮貨仍須百四十七元、其普通新鮮為百四十四元、百四十三元半、無錫原包宿粳則以前者旣未提足、茲亦獨立無變、仍開百三十四元、冲特貨百三十六元、</p>

<p>小麥　交易仍見沉寂、蓋目下新麥旣被統制、且產價高昂、貨方均見扳俏、喊價已達四十六七元、而日廠鬥市、仍限原盤收價、故亦無貨可收云、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債大小兩難</h3>

<h3>金融　滙豐有所供給　外匯買風始息</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌均平、英美滙暗市先緊後回平、乃於晨開後承上日緊勢、華商投機家傾扒、致八月美滙緊至五元一五六二五、英金三辦士一七一八七五、雁豐小櫃檯美匯五元一二五縮〇六二五、後滙豐忽來供售五元一八七五、投機扒風頓息、港電亦來拋售、曾賣硬至五元二一八七五、英金亦見回平、終兩滙與上日收價同、交易不稀、下午週三無市、</p>

<h3>逢高一致翻空　金市漲風頓挫</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、於盤旋中先漲後回、六千七百元大關三次衝出後、均卽回入、各方人心由堅轉疲、多方陣容漸起動搖、乃外匯因滙豐與港電均來供塞、由緊回平、且盛傳日將南進、故多方雖仗三日來餘威、極力活動、曾在混亂中升見六千七百十元、但己成强弩之末、廣幫拋空達七千兩、證券號德孚亦有三千兩、　西幫不斷爭售、午刻退見六千六百六十元、終尙軋升　元、半日交易共五六萬兩、下午週三無市、塲外價已退至六千六百四十五元、須軋小二十餘元、現金亦軋小數元、由益大售予天元五十兩、價照期交高一百八十元、後又出中興十兩、高二百七十元、飾金先漲五元、後回平、仍七百十五元、</p>
<p>期貨曾出七百元關</p>

<h3>紗花　獲利出籠　棉紗欲昂又止　最高見一六四一元</h3>
<p>紗市始昂繼平、但趨勢尙挺、此内原棉情形、依然上升、所以多方不看小、不過現紗售價雖硬、客幫採辦巳不及昔日之興旺、然今日出口裝運香港者有一千八百四十件、因之有一批獲利多頭出籠、市態轉趨半途、又有人說、近來四二支綫價旣貴、三二支單紗更昂、售價平均在二千二百元左右、如斯比較、二十支紗價平均在一千六百元之間、覺得較為廉宜、如果棉市不鬆、做空似乎不能劃算也、二十支雙馬高價為一千六百四十一元、低價為一千六百二十八元、惟午後跌風驟起、開盤價為一千六百三十元、繼以流言南進、市盤逐步下降至一千六百零九元、在市塲調査、實則某搶帽子投機輩、吐出一千包、又有一戶出五百包、於是檯面受其壓迫、最後價為一千六百十四五元、證券幫買進為多、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅昂之象續進、首盤價為一千六百三十五元、然買氣甚足、漲至一千六百四十一元、繼聞標金開高後又復回平一步、同時盈利人吐出、轉鬆至一千六百二十九元、但價格低落、買者仍不乏人、又升至一千六百三十五元、迨至收盤價為一千六百三十元、査半日問成交統計六千包、內香港幫進五百包、同行五千五百包、</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、承隔日餘勢、外棉賡續報漲、近期空頭紛補、七八兩月各漲四至六元半、拍至九月聞現紗漲後回鬆、即降四元、嗣後賣戶多而買者少、市價步軟、午收各跌一元至七元、成交一萬一千二百四十包、後市有傳日軍南進、及利空消息、多頭轉賣、空頭壓迫、市價下趨、結果各月比上日跌十五元至十八元、全日共成交二萬零三百四十包、比上日增加六千五百包、冉將全日開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>棉銷暢旺　價格難鬆</h3>
<p>現棉情况、依然堅挺、此因美印棉市、一味前進、購訂價日日增加、於是執貨者心思尤固、皆不願輕舉妄動、午後紗市回挫、形態稍平、、然價格仍難鬆弛也實則來源不暢、存底漸漸减縮所以趨勢佳妙也、</p>
<h3>美政府報吿　初次棉田减少</h3>
<p>華盛頓電、美政府一九四一年第一屆棉田報吿、耕種面積為二千三百五十一寓九千英畝、比去年初屆减少一百三十五萬二千英畝、原電錄左、（棉田單位千英畝、棉花單位千包）</p>
<h3>藥材　召皮堅漲</h3>
<p>召皮久無到貨、號存早已吿罄、茲聞號方曾在汕頭辦到一批、貨品尙佳、問値軋缺之際、相當　俏、故開價突升十餘元、</p>

<h3>修學講座　研究歷史的方法（四）</h3>
<p>— 薛無競</p>
<p>（二）古物的發見　談近代史易、讀中古史難、讀上古史則尤難、而史前的歷史、更是渺渺茫茫、不知從何處說起、近代和中古、我且按下不提、講到古代歷　、充滿了神秘的怪事、例如吳徐整三五歷紀言開天闢地之盤古氏有云、</p>
<p>天地混沌如鷄子、盤古生其中、萬八千歲、天地開闢、陽淸為天、陰濁為地、盤古在其中、一日九變、神於天、聖於地、天日高一丈、地日厚一丈、盤古日長一丈、如此萬八千歲、天數極高、地數極深、盤古極長、後乃有三皇、</p>
<p>這一段神話、眞是極離奇怪誕之大觀、其他如赤龍感女媧、神農龍首、大電澆北斗樞、照郊野、感附寶而生黃帝、更不知是神是人還是獸、所以近代有一位著作家、根本從秦談起、把秦以前的歷史、只是用輕描淡寫的方法、幾乎一筆勾消、則又未免太過、而史前的歷史、翻遍二十五史、也未道隻字、可是近代以來、地下所掘得的古物、發現之後、於是考古之士、風起雲湧、把研究所得、作成報吿、雖沒有整個成系統的古代史、給我們參考、然而把以前研究歷史的人、主觀心理、大大改變一下、這是値得我們大書特書、為治史學者、不可不注意的事、茲分述如左、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>彈震奇症</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>在第一次歐洲大戰的時候，有一個年輕的澳洲軍人，在戰塲上突患彈震病，不會說話，被送到戰地醫院去診治。治療的情形頗為良好，說話的能力巳經逐漸恢復，這時醫院遭遇敵軍空襲多次，護士們祗好在匆皇與混亂中把病人移至安全地點去。不料經此第二次的驚嚇，這靑年的兵士竟患了一種奇特的病症。他完全變成一個小孩的樣子，不會說話；給他一枝鉛筆，他手足無措，不知該怎麼辦。他似乎忘了週遭的各種普通物件的用處，用一種好奇與恇怯的態度審視着。他走起路來，搖搖欲墜，假使沒有人扶他，他就跌在地上，像小孩子那樣地爬。他不會目己吃東西。護士餵他的時候，每一口都要護士先嘗嘗看。他有時候嚶嚶而泣，他喜歡玩具。他除了身材是成人以外，其神態與嬰孩一般無二。這種希有的『返老還童』現象，變態心理學中稱之為退化症。</p>
<p>一個人要在戰塲上衝鋒陷陣，是需要相當的勇氣的。這位澳洲靑年，一方面怕上戰塲，另一方面又怕被目為懦夫，於是在不知不覺中便失去了言語的能力，達到了『不必打仗』的目的。後來遭遇空襲，病情加重，便發生了倒退現象，這完全是一種逃避作用，與駝烏埋首沙中一樣。</p>
<p>人生尤如戰塲。要作一個良好的戰士，唯有挺起勇氣來，面向現實。逃避難關的結果總是悲慘的。</p>
<p>生理</p>
<h3>六種新的感覺</h3>
<p>— 郭棟材</p>
<p>也許你一直以為你的身體上具有五種接受外界刺激的生理感覺，然而現在醫學家吿訴我們說：實際上人類共有十一種感覺·除了我們巳經熟悉的視，聽，觸，味，嗅那五種「舊」的感覺外，現在應加上以下的六種「新」感覺：</p>
<p>（一）溫度感覺—你身上約有三萬個溫暖感覺點以及二十五萬個寒冷感覺點。你如將你的手掌放在你的頰上，定必覺得手冷，如將手移到耳朶上時，則覺得耳朶冷了·這是因為手上有一正常溫度，其高低剛巧在頰與耳之間。</p>
<p>（二）平衡感覺—你耳內的三半規管是管理這種感覺的機關，也能使你在走路時保持平穩</p>
<p>（三）飢餓感覺—飢餓和嗜慾不同，它是一種眞的感覺，由於胃壁肌肉收縮而起。</p>
<p>（四）筋肉感覺—當你從地上拿起一件物的時候，你的筋肉即經由你的腦子而判斷出物的重量來，當你判斷一目的物的距離時，由於管理調節眼球焦點距離的肌肉的收縮或鬆弛而吿訴你物體的遠近，當你要發出聲音，筋肉感覺將吿訴你應如何去收縮你的喉頭筋肉以發出一個足够響亮的叫喊聲，而不致使別人聽不見。</p>
<p>（五）痛苦感覺—這是一種身體上散布最廣的感覺，任何的過度的刺激都產生痛苦的感覺，你身體上如有不適，痛苦就常指示你患病的所在地，因為痛苦常是疾病的附屬物，痛苦感覺雖然使我們如何地難過，但我們却不能將它視為一種可詛咒的東西，它實在是一種給我們的恩惠，因為我們身體任何部分有損壞時，它　是給我們的一種危險的警吿。</p>
<p>（六）渴的感覺—渴的感覺如不能滿足時，那是最痛苦的一種感覺，但是我們除了飲水止渴外，也可以將液體注射到血管內以止渴。</p>
<h3>「輸血」我見</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>輸血—我也耳聞過，也目睹過。</p>
<p>但我所聞見的和菲子先生所聞見的很有不同。幾年前，當我的伯父昏沉沉地躺在一個醫院裹的病床上而醫生認為不得不替他輸血時，我們並不曾費了多大的努力，就邀到了三位勞動者。</p>
<p>這三位勞動者中間有一位是曾給人輸過一兩次的，臉色蒼白的胖子。其餘兩位是新人。在化騐血型的時候，並沒有「滑稽的一幕」的演出。而那位入選的新人在輸血時，只縐了一下眉頭。在另一方面，菲子先生的「兩位苦力階級」：一位「急速溜了」，一位「要求免試」使人想見當時他們兩位欲換錢而不得（嚇煞）的窘態。（不是不「慷慨」，我想。）實在是「滑稽」的！</p>
<p>但我却也沒有能够發現上面的那位勞動者「把輸血看作極榮譽的事」，或者他已意識到「人類互助的偉大」；他大槪只是把自己的血液作為商品出賣：他輸出了血，拿到一些並不多的錢，就悄悄地走他的。</p>
<p>這之後，我又在一張報上讀到一個出賣血液的人的自白。那裹面訴說着血的代價的低廉，他的競爭者日益增多之類。</p>
<p>一個多月前，我的一個親戚為了病，也輸了一次血。在他病後，我去訪問他。他對我說：「一共輸了三百CC，計七十五元錢，比打補針來得便宜。」當他說這話時，他的態度顯得非常安閒。或者就是所謂「處之泰然」吧？</p>
<p>我的見聞儘止於此。眞是平凡得很！雖然它也許正多少地顯示了我們的「國情」—現化的眞相，甚至於使人開始懷疑「科學沒有階級性」那句話。</p>
<p>在這個社會裹，最多「慷他人之慨」的事。眞正的人類互助也唯有待諸未來吧。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3>德國的傘兵</h3>
<p>— 方紹曾</p>
<p>在德國西普魯士巴郎堡市的東區，有一部份地方，是完全劃出來作為訓練傘兵之用的。他們學習怎樣的從高處跳下來，怎樣以猫式在屋面上爬行而能完全不被人發現，他們認為降落在屋頂上是最不容易給人發現的，他們認為最危險的是在空中下降的時候，但現在他們能用一種特製的粉末，在自己的四週撒成一個烟幕，以避免發現。此外，他們還帶有特製剪刀，可以剪開鋼板，帶鈎的絲繩，可以幫助他跳下較低的房子上或街上。他們所帶的毛瑟槍是根據最新設計製成，具有明亮的形式，即使在黑暗的地方，也可以自由應用，毫無困難，每個傘兵都是訓練好的神槍手。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦馬</p>
<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>梅寶一賭氣便把脚步收住了。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你當我不生眸子嗎？」</p>
<p>梅寶越是這樣嬌嗔假惱，秋海棠便越是愛她；不等她再說什麼話，他已把那空着的左手，突然把她抱起來了。</p>
<p>「孩子，你當然是不生眼睛的！他一說，一面就不住的吻着梅寶的小臉。「你沒有瞧見這頂傘有多麽大嗎？咱們並着肩同走，遮了你，那裏還能遮到我；要大家不淋濕，祇有讓我抱着你。」</p>
<p>梅寶原想摔脫他的手，依舊跳到地上來，但聽他這麼一說，便只能讓他抱着了。</p>
<p>「算你說得不錯，好爸爸！」她爽快把兩條手臂勾住了她父親的頭頸。「……啊！爸爸，你身上的衣服已經全濕透了！為了我，你這樣的吃苦，明天起我再也不來念書了……！回頭你再害起病來，……」</p>
<p>十數年來父女倆相依為命的生活，即使梅寶是一個天性極凉薄的孩子，也不能對她父親沒有一些感情；何况她的個性原是最仁厚不過的，當她的手指才摸到秋海棠的濕透了的衣服時，便禁不住失聲大喊了。</p>
<p>「僅僅淋濕了一些，孩子，急什麽呢？」</p>
<p>但梅寶已嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來了。</p>
<p>「喂！痴孩子，哭什麽啊？你瞧快要進市梢了，敎人家看見了不怕羞嗎？」秋海棠笑着說，一面還在她頰上用力吻了兩下。</p>
<p>梅寶却委實沒法止住自己的哭。</p>
<p>秋海棠抱着她走了一大段路，手裹也眞覺得有些累了，便凑勢收住脚步，很小心地把傘換到左手裹，再把女兒換到右手裹。（一五四）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>談伶人當衆揮毫</h3>
<p>— 天奇</p>
<p>伶人登台演劇，應以唱念做打文武工夫為前提，其次則為扮相之美豓，服裝之研究。自本戲問世以來，機關佈景亦為要素之一。乃自二慧（慧生慧寶）首創劇中挿入書畫後，遂致羣相仿效，別具一種新穎特別的局面。在昔伶人通翰墨，能書畫者極多，民國以來，凡屬伶人如不能書畫，好像有不能擠入名伶之列之勢。是以男女伶人，於從師研究戲劇之外，必延名書畫家，敎授寫繪，俾得表示風雅，誇耀儕輩。因此，書畫二事，竟成為伶人應有之副藝，即不能書畫者，亦必聘一能書能畫者，為之代庖。蓋伶人書畫，己成一種風氣，所以伶人成名固賴藝術之優美，而書畫之助，亦頗佔相當的力量。其後仿而效之者，有坤旦新豓秋，在玉京道人劇中，當塲繪蘭。武生李萬春，在二本武松中大書「殺人者武松也」，及楊寶森在猪八戒戲內之題字，吳素秋在白玉樓中之留名，均為全劇增加不少精彩。總之，伶人書畫，近己成為最普遍之舉，至於劇中加入書晝，實為苟時二慧所首創者也。</p>
<h3>左軍編寫　「阿Q二世」劇本</h3>
<p>— 士貝</p>
<p>魯迅先生的「阿Q正傳」，毫無疑義地，是一部非但震撼我國而且也是世界的文學鉅著了。因此，田漢和許幸之，都曾改編為舞台劇本，並且數次公演，所得的評價，當然至上至高的。</p>
<p>現在，獲到一個消息，在桂林編輯新中國戲劇的左軍，特地續「阿Q正傳」後，編寫一部「阿Q二世」，當然，在沒有讀到原作前，我們不敢判定它在文化上的價値。然而，我們相信，在抗戰情緒亢進的內地，產生的劇本，一定刺激有力，配合着時代性，利用阿Q在封建社會制度中的生活，給某一種人的刺激。</p>
<h3>紀茀萊克導演</h3>
<p>— 吳鳴</p>
<p>提起茀萊克，大家該不會生疏吧，他，就是最近為民華完成「世界兒女」的一位德籍導演，他最近又寫成了一部中國化的電影劇本，那是描寫上海生活的一部現社會劇本，但寫成後交那家公司攝製，尙未決定，至於「世界兒女」，正在剪輯中，將於秋凉後公映。</p>
<p>關於茀萊克以往的導演經歷，我可為讀者報道一下，他最初學習美術，在舞臺上度過十年的演員生活，由演員躍為舞臺導演，再由舞臺導演躍為電影導演，他第一次導演影片，是在奧國維也納某影片公司，同時還兼任佈景及攝影師。以後，陸續至巴黎，倫敎，羅馬，匈牙利各地週遊拍影片，在巴黎，導演「拉薩夫人之女」，在匈牙利，導有「虛浮醫生」，前後在歐洲共計導演有二百部左右的影片，當他來滬前，在歐洲導演最後的一部影片，是「吉潑之父」，在美國獲得很好的賣座，認為是美國的佳作之一，此次他來上海，對於中國電影的感想，認為中國的影片公司，設備尙完全，意識亦還健全，祇是在技術方面較差，所以他很有這個願望，來提高中國電影技術人才的水準。</p>

<p>許靖在旁對周遇吉慨然說道：「將軍是主帥，如何可以冒這個危險？還是讓末將出去，衝退他們，好讓城上修葺完備，賊不得上。」周遇吉沒有別的好辦法，旣然許靖願代自己出戰，只好許可。遂撥敢死之士五百名，敎許靖率領。許靖自己騎了一匹銀鬃馬，拔上戰鎧，左手握槍，左手執劍，開了城門，衝過吊橋去。流寇好久沒見官軍出戰，不防有這一下。許靖懷着必死之心，槍挑劍劈，只顧向賊兵陣裹亂衝。攻城的流寇乃是第九隊抵擋不住，紛紛後退。許靖為要使關上的守兵騰出時間來修理城垣，所以儘往前奔，今天的勇氣速他自己也不知道從那裹來的。部下的五百士卒也都奮勇廝殺。李自成聞官軍出戰，第九隊敗下，急令第十隊和第一隊第二隊上前接應，合力作戰。第十隊的賊將管有勇，上前接住許靖大戰，不到二十合，被許靖一槍刺斃。然第一隊第二隊已從左右包抄過來，將許靖一枝人馬困住。而第三隊繼續掩上。周遇吉在城上要緊督促士卒挑土負石，趕修城墻缺壤之處，不及去救援許靖。闖將一隻虎揮動大刀，和許靖力戰。許靖咬緊牙齒，拚命狠鬬。戰得良久，部下五百死士，死的死，傷的傷，能戰的祇剩三十多人了。許靖今天也不想活命，運用全力與一隻虎死拚。然而一隻虎力氣無窮，許靖的槍法漸見散亂，一隻虎乘隙一刀去掃他的臂膀。許靖不及還槍招架，把左手劍去遮護時，臂上已被刀鋒削着，帶去了一小片肉。血跡淋漓，一陣疼痛，手裏更覺乏力，只得回馬落荒而逃。因為他若想追入城中，事實上已不可能，一則後路已被遮斷，二則恐反使賊兵乘機衝人城關，所以他寗走別處。（一一一）</p>

<h3>Romania Oil Production Center Destroyed, Destroyed by Soviet Air Force</h3>
<p>Reuters Nine Nations London Electric Telegram Today, Moscow Radio announced that the Romanian oil production center has been bombed and destroyed by the Soviet Union. The radio station reporter first stated the importance of the Viesti oil field to Germany, with Ploiesti as its refueling center and Constanta as its export port, but now they have all been bombed and destroyed by Soviet aircraft.</p>
<h3>German Forces Fiercely Attack Stalin's Defense Line, Soviet Forces Launch Powerful Counterattack, Tank Battle Breaks Out in Belarus Region, German Forces Attempt to Invade Kiev and Leningrad Are Contained</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The Soviet Union recently announced that the Red Army had defeated the German mechanized forces in the Liber area northeast of Minsk. The German advances towards Leningrad and Kiev seem to have been contained by the Soviet counterattack. The Soviet forces in the Novograd-Volynsky regions south of the Pripet Marshes are still trying to stop the German offensive towards Kiev. Fierce fighting continues in the Bakovichi region. On the evening of Tuesday, the Soviet Union shot down 62 enemy planes and lost 7 of its own.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 9th - German forces and assault teams fiercely attacked the Soviet Stalin defense line yesterday. The German side pointed out that this huge battle is a decisive battle for the overall situation. The Soviet Supreme Command has concentrated all available reserve forces to defend the front line, so the fierceness of the battle is unprecedented. The Soviet resistance is extremely fierce. The most intense German offensive is between Lusk and Kiev and along the Dnieper River. The German News Agency said that after 15 hours of general offensive, the German army penetrated the Soviet defense line in the northern front and captured elite Asian troops in the Soviet army. It is now pursuing the Soviet army along the entire eastern front. Since July 2, it has captured 142,000 Soviet soldiers. Although the Red Army's resistance is firm, the German and Romanian coalition forces still captured many fortresses after a fierce attack, and seized 584 tanks, 550 artillery pieces, and several armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Moscow, 9th - Moscow Radio broadcast last night that the Red Army launched an overwhelming counterattack against the German armored forces yesterday, recovering some lost ground. The radio station broadcast an official communique stating that the Soviet army carried out a powerful counterattack at various strongholds on the front line all day long. The communique stated that as a result of the attacks by Soviet Russian artillery, aircraft and tanks in the Ostrov area of the northern front, the German army suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Moscow, 9th - "Izvestia" reported yesterday that Soviet artillery and machine guns completely annihilated a regiment of the Romanian Royal Guard in fierce border battles, with only four farmers from the regiment surrendering and surviving. According to yesterday's official communique, Soviet troops fought desperately and launched counterattacks at various strongholds on the 1,500-mile front. Two regiments of German infiltrators were annihilated near Bobruisk, and two regiments of German troops were annihilated near the border between Ukraine and Bessarabia. Near Ostrov, south of Lake Peipus on the Estonian border, and in the Leningrad war zone, Polotsk in northern Belarus, Liber in the south, Bobruisk southeast of Minsk, Novograd-Volynsky in northern Ukraine, and Machilev on the border between Ukraine and Bessarabia, fierce battles were reported to have taken place.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 9th - Berlin Radio quoted the official German News Agency as saying that German troops had occupied Ostrov, Berno, and Feling today.</p>
<h3>Soviet War Report</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 9th - On the 8th night and 9th, fierce battles took place in Polotsk (southeast of Minsk), Bir (south of Polotsk), and Novograd-Volynsky (west of Kiev).

<h3>Germany Uses Secret Weapons to Break Through Stalin's Defense Line</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 9th - Military circles reported last night that the German army used a new type of secret weapon to bomb and destroy the extremely strong defensive works of the Stalin defense line and break through the Soviet main fortress, and captured 142,000 Soviet soldiers. This new weapon is a secret machine. With its great power, even the strongest reinforced concrete defensive works of modern times will be reduced to powder. It is said that the German army and the elite Soviet army fought fiercely for 15 hours and finally broke through the northern area of the Stalin defense line. On July 2 and 5, another 584 tanks and 550 heavy artillery pieces were captured. German military authorities said that due to strategic reasons, the details of the German offensive could not be fully disclosed.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 9th - It is rumored that the elite German army, with the help of a "secret engine," has broken through the Stalin defense line and is now gradually expanding the gap in the Soviet fortress. The German elite engineering corps, including chemical warfare experts, has used secret weapons to split the Stalin defense line because the Red Army's resistance is fierce. The German High Command said that although a large number of Red Army reserve soldiers resisted fiercely, these gaps are now expanding non-stop. It is said that the rupture is in the northern area, and the German army fought fiercely with the elite Soviet army for 15 hours, including the famous Asian special elite troops.</p>
<h3>Red Army is Advantageous in a Protracted War, German Army is Having Supply Problems</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 9th - War correspondent Dr. Lisike reported in the Berlin Stock Exchange yesterday morning that the German Supreme Commander has newly dispatched several army corps to the Eastern battlefield, which will be used to attack the enemy's main positions.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The German army is still transferring its tank fleets to join the battle, which obviously has no decisive effect. Recent neutral sources strongly emphasize the truth of the war situation, which cannot be observed solely from the recent German advance. Responsible persons in London said that if the German army cannot make a real breakthrough in the next few days, its efforts may have a very long rest. According to the experience of modern mechanized warfare, armored vehicle units will start to feel tired after two weeks of continuous combat. At the same time, the German army's supply problems will inevitably become more acute, while the Soviet Union, because its rear transportation lines are intact, will be more advantageous in combat. The Soviet army's mechanized units have not advanced as much as the German side, resulting in exhaustion. Yesterday, the Soviet side admitted that the German army had crossed the Vinnitsa River, saying that the army planned to set up defenses on the north bank.</p>
<h3>Roman Newspaper Comments on the War Situation and Admits that Germany's Victory is Difficult</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Rome, 9th - "Il Popolo di Roma" today hinted for the first time that the Germans may have some difficulties in breaking through the Stalin defense line. The newspaper also predicted that the German army may have a period of reorganizing its military apparatus before it can fully attack the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union is still strong and well-equipped at this time, the newspaper said that the Germans may now be implementing a large-scale reorganization of the war machine. The Germans must now be consolidating the foundation of their transportation lines and military supplies for the second phase of the war. Because the Germans are now fighting against a Soviet Union that has been preparing for more than 20 years, the Germans are now facing a Soviet Union that no longer has the Baltic countries, Poland, Bukovina, and Bessarabia as buffer states. Therefore, the Germans will inevitably take greater precautions. The Soviet Union's preparation for a long-term war is an undeniable fact, and the Soviet army is also structured in a modern way. The Soviet Union's failures in the first few weeks were due to two main reasons: one because the Soviet army lacked the same excellent training as the German army, and the biggest reason was that it was caught off guard by a sudden attack while it was concentrating its troops on the border. However, we should admit that the Soviet army is fighting with great spirit and determination. Whether its commander can prevent the failure of Brest-Litovsk from affecting the overall situation remains to be seen. The future war will be focused on attacking the Stalin defense line. The sooner the German army breaks through the Stalin defense line, the sooner the end of the war will be a matter of time.</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Allied Forces Continue to Advance Eastward, Rumors that They Have Reached the Old Soviet-Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 9th - The German News Agency reported yesterday that the German and Romanian armies, under the command of Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu, had penetrated deep into the Red Army defense line on the Dniester River, and said that after fierce fighting, they had penetrated into Bessarabia and reached the former Soviet-Romanian border.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 9th - According to responsible military authorities here yesterday, on Sunday, the German-Romanian Allied Forces in Bessarabia had crushed the Soviet army's resistance, and Soviet fortresses and positions had been captured. The Soviet army had been forced to retreat to the Dniester River.</p>
<h3>Soviet Resistance is Quite Strong on the Kola Peninsula</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Stockholm, 9th - The "Stockholm Daily News" war correspondent has just returned from the front line in Ukraine. According to his talks, the German army is preparing to adopt a strategy of surprise, which is no different from the one adopted in the Battle of France last year. The first step for the German army is to occupy the ports of Murmansk, the capital of Estonia, Smolensk, Kiev, and Odessa. However, the Soviet resistance on the Kola Peninsula is quite strong. Although railway traffic between the port of Murmansk and Leningrad has been interrupted, it has not yet been isolated. The Finnish side also admitted that the war is progressing slowly.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Helsinki, 9th - Last night's official communique also stated that the Finnish army had crossed the Red Army defense line northwest of Latva and penetrated ten kilometers. Another Finnish army also broke through the Soviet defense line and penetrated dozens of kilometers.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Helsinki, 9th - According to war news released here, the German-Finnish Allied Forces have made progress on all fronts. The German Air Force has launched fierce bombing raids on Soviet rear positions in northern Karelia. The Finnish army has also made progress in central and southern East Karelia. North of Lake Ladoga, the war is progressing smoothly. The besieged Soviet troops on the Hanko Peninsula are now under heavy bombardment. The Soviet Air Force bombed the port of Kotka. Finland suffered very little loss, with ten houses burned.</p>
<h3>The National Government and the Malayan Government Have Reached a Complete Understanding, Overseas Chinese in Malaya are Loyal to the National Government, Diao Zuqian Arrives in Hong Kong and Tells Reporters</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Diplomatic Envoy Diao Zuqian was ordered to go to Singapore three months ago to inspect, and the matter has now been completed. He arrived in Hong Kong by transport today. According to Diao's words to reporters, a complete understanding has now been reached between the Chinese government and the Malayan government. Former Overseas Minister Wu Tiecheng and newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's visits to Malaya have made a significant contribution to this understanding. Regarding the situation of Overseas Chinese in Malaya, Diao stated that they are loyal to the National Government. Previously, Overseas Chinese in the area were only allowed to remit 500,000 yuan of national currency back to China each month, but this has now been increased to 750,000 yuan. It is said that Malaya has been greatly strengthened, and local officials and people are prepared to deal with any eventuality. (Eighth Electric Telegram)</p>
<h3>Will a Large-Scale War Break Out in the Pacific? Speculations in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - The Japanese "Kokumin Shimbun" speculated today that a large-scale war may break out in the Pacific. The newspaper said, "If the United States implements the intentions of the Washington leaders and begins a war of encirclement against Japan, a large-scale war may break out in the Pacific. This encirclement will not only use the lands of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union as military bases, but will also cooperate with elements in China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. The United States' policy towards the Soviet-German war is to directly and indirectly aid the Soviet Union. The main purpose is to put pressure on Japan, but the United States is still hesitant and undecided, not knowing whether to attack the east and defend the west, or attack the west and defend the east, or fight on both fronts simultaneously. But Japan cannot be as hesitant and undecided as the United States. This is something that the American people should understand."</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade Plummets, Now Seeking New Markets, Especially Paying Attention to the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - According to opinions in Japanese business circles, the Japanese government is aware that U.S.-Japan trade will be greatly affected by the current war, so it is now seeking new markets to replace the increasingly depressed U.S. market. Those in official circles searching for new markets are mostly focusing on India, South China, and Vietnam. The shrinking of Japan's export market has been proven in Japanese stores in Tokyo and Yokohama. Items that Japan previously manufactured exclusively for export can now be purchased in the country. However, Japanese business circles said that U.S.-Japan trade is currently not very unsatisfactory, but they know that the U.S. government has a tendency to impose strict restrictions on imports of Japanese goods. The general opinion is that these restrictions will become increasingly severe. The Japanese are trying to develop the Japanese goods market in Central and South America, but general trade magazines do not express excessive excitement about this. As for Japan wanting to purchase goods from South America that the U.S. government is unwilling to provide to Japan, it is especially difficult. U.S. customers in South America offer prices that are much higher than what the Japanese are willing to offer. Therefore, government experts have drafted a procedure for obtaining new raw materials, preparing to devote all efforts to obtaining all needed raw materials in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere," especially in China and Vietnam. Although Japan's recent economic demands to the Dutch East Indies failed, it is generally believed that Japan will eventually make demands again at the most appropriate opportunity. French and Japanese authorities have completed a new economic negotiation, from which Japan can obtain greater development benefits in Vietnam than before. Japan is also continuing to conduct trade negotiations with the Soviet Union to increase trade between the two countries, but these negotiations have been shaken by the Soviet-German war. The latest Soviet-Japanese trade agreement of 30,000,000 yen has not yet been approved, but Japanese officials have stated that Japan has not abandoned this agreement. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war cut off the Siberian route between Germany and Japan, Japan's only market in Europe has also disappeared. As a result of the decline in Japanese trade in Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and South America, thousands of Japanese overseas Chinese have become unemployed and returned to their country. Every ship from the United States and the South Pacific, especially Australia, the Philippines, and Singapore, carries a large number of Japanese people, and the number is increasing.</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Economic Relations Encounter Difficulties, The Matter of Vietnamese Rice Delivery to Japan Will Be Handled According to the Agreement</h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 9th - French authorities admit that difficulties have arisen regarding the delivery of rice to Japan in accordance with the terms of the economic agreement, but it does not raise issues of credibility, because the total amount stipulated annually is 700,000 tons, and 400,000 tons have already been delivered in five months. Rice exports have recently exceeded 100,000 tons per month, which is unprecedented in the Saigon market, so the attacks in Tokyo newspapers are considered unfair. It is said that the current plowing season will last until September, and this year's harvest was originally estimated to be around 1.4 million tons, but due to floods and other reasons, it may not exceed 1.1 million tons. According to official rice market reports, all flour mills have stopped working due to a lack of grains. The government is now taking steps. The Governor of Vietnam has issued an order in the name of the Official Rice Committee, requiring the committee to sell all rice to Japan at a stipulated price. All inventories exceeding five tons must be reported, and hoarders will be severely punished. Vietnamese officials argue that all other goods stipulated in the agreement have been delivered on time. They also said that they are unaware of any Japanese pressure on the Vietnamese government, and do not believe in the news from Shanghai that Japan has the possibility of advancing southward. Japanese Consul General Minoda told visiting reporters that some technical difficulties have now arisen, but Japan has not taken formal steps. It is the responsibility of the Vietnamese government to deliver goods in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Lieutenant General Kohsaka Jun Arrives in Taipei</h3>
<p>Reuters, Taipei, 9th - The newly appointed Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in China, former Commander of the Japanese Army in South China, Lieutenant General Kohsaka Jun, arrived here this afternoon from Guangzhou. He met with Lieutenant General Motomura, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Taiwan, and is scheduled to fly to Tokyo on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Evacuate from the Soviet Union One After Another</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - According to information from the "Asahi Shimbun" in Moscow today, the Japanese Embassy in Moscow has decided to evacuate the third batch of residents. This evacuation will include eight embassy staff members, two staff members of the Army Attache Office, and one staff member of the Northern Sakhalin Oil Company. It is also said that the Soviet authorities have stepped up the inspection of foreign mail to prevent the leakage of military secrets.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Poland are Conducting Negotiations to Resolve Disputes Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Representatives of Poland and the Soviet Union will soon meet here to continue negotiations in order to resolve disputes between the two countries and end the state of war that technically still exists between the two countries. The Polish and Soviet sides will first carry out various preliminary work, and then Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Polish Prime Minister Sikorski discussed relations between the two countries on Saturday and Sunday last week. According to news last night, the discussion was very important and had exciting developments, but there are still many things to be discussed. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that one of the main points of the negotiations is the Polish soldiers who are currently being detained by the Soviet side. It has now been suggested that these Polish soldiers should be reorganized and re-equipped, and placed under the command of the Polish government to fight the common enemy again. British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski at the Foreign Office last night to discuss Soviet-Polish relations and other events.</p>
<h3>British Men Leaving Hong Kong Must Obtain Exit Permits</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Authorities announced that all British men aged sixteen or older must obtain exit permits before leaving Hong Kong, with the exception of Chinese people. This is another new sign of intensified war preparations. However, British passengers arriving in the territory and leaving on the same ship do not need to obtain permits. (Reuters Electric Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Send a Telegram to the Central Government Expressing Sincerity</h3>
<p>Philippines, 7th (Delayed) - The memorial meeting for the fourth anniversary of various Overseas Chinese circles in this area sent a special telegram to Chairman Lin to pay tribute. The original telegram said, Three. To Chairman Lin of the Chongqing National Government: Four years have passed since the war of resistance and national reconstruction began. The world's war situation is newly changing. We look up to the Big Dipper, and the command of the central government is stable. Leading from Sichuan, the Overseas Chinese are devoted. Sending a telegram to express sincerity and paying tribute in the wind.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Occupation of Iceland</h3>
<p>The U.S. military has taken over Iceland, and the U.S. defense line has actually extended beyond the generally perceived Western Hemisphere. This is actually only the first step in a new operation. The other locations outside the Western Hemisphere mentioned by President Roosevelt in his speech yesterday regarding the mission to defend the Americas may be farther from the Americas than Iceland, and thus involve further contact with the outer fringes of the European war. This is naturally an active and extraordinary measure, but it is not necessarily correct to believe that the United States is about to enter the war because of this. For the time being, whether the United States enters the war mainly depends on whether the Soviet Union can contain the Nazi offensive, and it also depends on whether the joint front of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be quickly and actively launched. On the Axis side, with the war against the Soviet Union not progressing smoothly, it will not openly take hostile actions against another major power, either psychologically or practically.</p>
<p>In recent days, American public opinion has almost unanimously praised the move to send troops to occupy Iceland and has discussed further steps. This shows that President Roosevelt's exercise of commander-in-chief power to take action in non-U.S. territory outside the Western Hemisphere is implicitly encouraged by public opinion, and it also shows that the sentiment for the United States to enter the war is becoming more mature. From the day that Wilson returned empty-handed from the European War and Peace Conference twenty years ago, American foreign policy has been constrained by isolationism almost every day, especially in the last ten years. However, as the sins of aggression have been indulged and have become more rampant, the struggle against isolationism in the United States has become more intense. Recently, although people like Wheeler and Lindbergh still hold on to their remaining positions, they have lost their original momentum and appeal. The step taken by the U.S. authorities the day before yesterday should be considered an important page in American history in breaking through the constraints of isolationism and taking decisive action.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's refusal to clearly define the boundary between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in his speech the day before yesterday shows that he is no longer constrained by the traditional conservative ideas of the past in the United States, but the focus of his current attention is obviously still on the Atlantic. This is probably because Germany is doing its best to attack the Soviet Union and has no time or ability to attend to advances and retreats at sea, rather than because the United States has actually felt a more serious threat in the Atlantic. From the perspective of the actual situation: the heroic resistance of the Soviet Union and the maritime hegemony of Britain are both strong guarantees for the defense of the eastern United States. Although Germany has elite air forces, it lacks a strong fleet to cooperate at sea. The threat it can pose to the United States is not comparable to the direct exposure of the western United States and Alaska to the world's third-largest navy. President Roosevelt's mention in his speech yesterday of the impact on the defensive capabilities of Hawaii and Alaska, especially the fact that the main force of the U.S. Navy has always been stationed at Pearl Harbor, is enough to prove that the U.S. authorities have absolutely not neglected the Pacific. However, judging from their recent concerns and measures regarding the two oceans, they are clearly more active regarding the European situation.</p>
<p>Judging by the consistent policy tradition of the United States, appeasement policies should not infiltrate the U.S. authorities' foreign operations, but their recent lack of vigilance and active measures toward the Far East cannot help but arouse suspicion among some people. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Far East war has clearly merged with the European war. Even in the Soviet Union, which is closer to Japan than the United States, this has been confirmed in Stalin's recent speech. Therefore, in a democratic country that has always adhered to the anti-aggression stance, there should be no distinction between the wars in Europe and Asia. In the current situation, the European war is naturally larger in scale, and its impact on the world is more serious, but the Far East war has always remained an important part of it. Taking a wait-and-see attitude in this kind of situation is by no means inaction, but rather watching for the most favorable opportunity to act. Yesterday's news from Tokyo indicated that Britain's future actions will depend on the true implementation of the Tripartite Pact, which will determine Britain's attitude. This news may not be entirely reliable, but it also means that it will change from active to passive, and its true meaning is that the danger in the Far East has increased again.</p>
<p>From the current international situation, the Nazi blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union has by no means succeeded, and its momentum and even its strength have suffered serious setbacks. Therefore, it has increased the convenience of Britain and the United States to defeat the Nazis. Therefore, although the United States' occupation of Iceland and consideration of further actions are wise, its failure to use the same active measures in the Far East is a major regret. If the northward advance actually materializes, the first to bear the brunt will of course be Vladivostok, but it will immediately endanger the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, and the proposed safety zone recently reported is an extremely important matter. It is certainly not a good thing for the war to expand further into the Pacific, but it is an even greater danger to entrust the security of the Pacific to the goodwill of the aggressor.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Calls for Britain and the Soviet Union to Fight to the End: No Country Can Protect Itself Unless Hitlerism Is Eliminated</h3>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from London on the 9th: Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov broadcast from Moscow last night, urging Britain and the Soviet Union to continuously and tirelessly strike at Hitler. He said that the German-Soviet war has forced Hitler to transfer his troops from west to east, allowing the British people to rest slightly after experiencing twelve months of continuous bombing. However, Hitler has obviously miscalculated the nature of his attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Germany had signed a non-aggression treaty, which was recognized by Hitler himself with a solemn declaration. Now that Nazi Germany has perfidiously attacked the peaceful Soviet Union, this has given the world new and overwhelming evidence that as long as the Nazi system and Hitlerism exist, no country, regardless of its policy, can feel safe. The agreements and obligations, promises or guarantees, and neutrality declarations or any relationships made by Hitler and his followers cannot guarantee immunity from their sudden and unprovoked attacks, and peace cannot protect against their repeated attacks at any time. Hitler's main goal is to defeat enemy countries one by one. This is the reason why we should cooperate and continuously strike together. Every strike now has the same effect as those made later, while the cost and sacrifice are greatly reduced. Have we not already learned from the writings and speeches of Hitler and others that Hitler believes that he disdains all concepts of national peaceful coexistence and international obligations and morality? In his autobiography, Hitler himself described how haggard and disappointed he felt during the ten years of international peace. Without war, there is no way to see life, fields stained with blood, cities reduced to ruins, starvation, tears of mothers and wives - these are all elements that Hitler feels happy and comforted by. The Soviet government was the first to recognize the crisis of Nazi aggression against the world and asked all countries to cooperate to stop it and jointly reject it. The calls were made repeatedly, but there were few responses. It is not the time to talk about the reasons for this today. When the house is on fire, the urgent task is to put out the fire. As for why preventive measures were not taken in advance and who should be responsible, it can only be studied afterwards. Europe is now in flames, and other places are also partly in flames. There are already many countries whose independence has been stripped away, whose lands have been trampled on, as if locusts have passed through, and whose people have been oppressed like slaves. And the few countries that are now struggling for a dilapidated independent existence under the illusory cover of neutrality, friendship with Germany, and non-aggression pacts, how can they know that they will not suffer the same fate in a short period of time? Britain and its dominions, with the active assistance of the United States, have fought with Hitler and his huge war machine, which is the result of six years of preparation. Now this struggle has come to the Soviet Union. It is the only responsibility of the Soviet Union to fight to the end against the common enemy. In his sinister plan to attack other countries in order to realize his dream of dominating the world, Hitler has always adhered to the principle of "divide and conquer." He used extremely sinister methods to prevent the invaded from organizing a common resistance, and especially focused on avoiding simultaneous wars on two fronts in the stronger countries in Europe. The Nazi strategy was to select its victims and defeat them one by one according to the circumstances. He originally intended to solve the Western countries first, and then he could freely turn to the Soviet Union, but he failed to fully achieve his wish because he encountered resistance. Hitler has not yet trained as a cross-channel swimmer, so he came up with another plan in his mind, thinking that he had obtained a de facto truce in the West, and might as well carry out his blitzkrieg in the East, and then use all his strength to pounce on Britain and destroy it. At the same time, Hitler hoped to alienate the East and West ideologically, so as to avoid simultaneous attacks on Germany from both sides. However, Hitler miscalculated the lightning nature of the attack on the eastern front and the mysterious power of ideological propaganda in the East. Because British Prime Minister Churchill, on the day that Germany launched an attack on the Soviet Union, announced to the world with his inherent statesmanlike vision that he would not be deceived by Hitler's cunning tricks, and declared that Hitler's victory over the Soviet Union would cause incalculable disasters to Britain. On the Soviet side, too, we know the harm that Hitler's victory in the West will bring to us. The Red Army is now developing its revolutionary miracle, alone resisting the attack of Hitler's entire powerful military machine, and forcing Hitler to continuously transfer his troops from west to east. Therefore, the British people are now getting a little rest. However, there is an extremely important matter that we must not let Hitler have a moment to breathe. Hitler should feel the disappointment that the de facto truce in the West has failed to materialize. Hitler's goal is to defeat them individually, while our goal should be to strike simultaneously and without stopping. Each strike now is ten times more effective than the strikes made later when the strength of any anti-war country is weakened, and the costs and sacrifices can also be greatly reduced. The Soviet Union and Britain are now fighting to preserve their national integrity and independence, so as not to be enslaved. The common victory of the two sides can liberate the people who are now groaning under Hitler's cruel trampling and open up a new path to organize a better life in accordance with the wishes of the liberated countries. The destruction of Hitlerism will be the elimination of the most shameful phenomenon of modern times and the eradication of the greatest obstacle to the development of inherent civilization. The peoples of the Soviet Union and Britain still have various hardships and frustrations and temporary disappointments, but there is no doubt that the peoples of the Soviet Union and Britain know their responsibility to history and to mankind, and will do their best to fulfill their historical responsibility. The Soviet people have now responded with fervent spirit to the call of the head of the Soviet government, that is, our comrade Stalin, and hundreds of millions of strong men have risen up to defend the motherland and embrace the firm determination to continue the struggle together with other free and freedom-loving people until fascist barbarism disappears from the earth.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Declares: Strive for Freedom Unremittingly; Do Not Hinder Britain's Life-and-Death War</h3>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Martah on the 9th: Gandhi issued a statement today, saying that the British are currently engaged in a life-and-death war. Therefore, in our current struggle, we should strive to reduce impediments. He has reiterated this a thousand times. This movement is not only not intended to harass the authorities, but will also strive to carefully avoid all kinds of impediments. Our struggle will continue indefinitely, at least for five years. It is not necessary to hastily fill the prisons. Merely going to prison cannot bring us closer to freedom. The morality of the people lies in learning to be disciplined, to endure suffering, and to self-sacrifice.</p>
<h3>French Ship Sunk in Turkish Territorial Waters; Turkey Protests to Britain</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Ankara on the 8th: The French ship "Saint-Didier" was sunk by British aircraft a few days ago in the sea near the Turkish port of Adalia. Fifty-two crew members died and eighteen were injured.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 9th: Turkey has protested to the British government about the British aircraft attack on the Turkish port of Adalia and the sinking of the French ship "Saint-Didier." It is said that the tone of the note is extremely stern. The note was delivered to the British government by the Turkish ambassador to Britain.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 9th: The French authorities issued the following details yesterday about the sinking of the French ship Saint-Didier by the British in the southern Turkish port of Adalia:</p>
<p>The French ship Saint-Didier was about to enter a seaport within Turkish territorial waters when it was suddenly attacked by British torpedo planes, but the ship did not sink and was still able to slowly enter the port. After the ship entered the port and dropped anchor, four more British torpedo planes threw bombs at it and strafed it with machine guns. The shrapnel also damaged other ships docked in the port. The French ship that was directly bombed sank in the port immediately. This incident is quite similar to the "Altmark" incident, except that the attack occurred in a port of a country allied with Britain, and the ship that was attacked was also a ship of a country that was formerly allied with Britain. The French ambassador has protested to the Turkish Foreign Minister about this attack. This is only a statement regarding the sinking of the "Saint-Didier" and no further details are released. As for how the British-Turkish relationship will be affected by this incident, we have yet to see in the future.</p>

<h3>President Chiang's Message to the Military and Civilians of the Nation - The Content Highlights Three Key Points - United with Sincerity and Solidarity to Enhance Combat Power, Promote National Spirit, Establish the Foundation for Revival, Grasp the Key Points of Nation-Building, and Complete the Great Revolutionary Cause</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 6th - President Chiang delivered a message to the military and civilians of the nation on the 4th Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The original text is as follows: "Fellow soldiers and compatriots across the country, today marks the fourth year of our sacred War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Recently, the global situation has seen rapid and clear developments. We are fortunate to encounter such a once-in-a-millennium era, allowing us to contribute our national strength to the world. This is truly the greatest fortune in life. Our cause of resisting aggression and building the nation is arduous, our future is bright, and our spirit is noble and pure. Today, the world has clearly divided into two major camps: aggressor nations and anti-aggression nations. The scope of aggression by the Axis powers is expanding simultaneously in Europe and Asia. All freedom-loving allies naturally stand on the same line to defend common justice and human civilization. I often say, 'We must fulfill our responsibility in the development of the overall global situation to achieve final victory and genuine success in our war effort.' Looking at the international changes over the past year, all the evil conspiracies of aggressive violence have been fully exposed, and the cooperation of anti-aggression forces has been strengthened. All these changes are in line with our expectations. Now, we share responsibilities and cooperate with various allies related to the Pacific. This clear and distinct situation is not accidental. Today, we should express infinite respect and love for all the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the country. At the same time, we ourselves should actively work to fulfill their legacy. The exposure of Japan's political and economic weaknesses does not need further elaboration from me. Looking at it broadly, this year they colluded with Germany and Italy to form the Tripartite Pact, announced the treaty signed in [illegible], declared the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,' threatened Southeast Asia, and acted recklessly. However, in the South Pacific, the joint defense of the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands was established in the past six months. In the north, the Soviet Union has always seen through Japan's opportunistic tactics and has not abandoned its vigilance. Since the outbreak of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Japan's cabinet and headquarters have frequently held joint meetings, deliberately equivocating externally and trying to cover up internally. Our military and civilians across the country must know that the development of our overall War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and the clarity of the international situation are the results of our four years of struggle. Everything is as we expected. We have restrained Japan for the most important four years for the world, allowing freedom-loving allies to prepare calmly to respond to the aggressive bloc. In these few points, it can be said that the preliminary goal of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has been achieved. However, at the same time, we must be vigilant and prepared, because in the world, things often fail when success is within reach. The closer the hope of success, the more potential for failure and danger. In terms of the global war situation, today the key to Asia outweighs Europe. We are a major country in Asia and a central figure in the East Asian war. We should actively strive to take responsibility for the safety of Asia. Therefore, our responsibility today is greater. I want to awaken my military and civilians across the country to have a serious awareness of their own duties, and it is particularly important to have a full understanding of the following three points: First, we must be united with sincerity and solidarity and enhance our combat power. Since the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction began, our national credo has been 'nation above all' and 'victory first.' Today, we have entered a new stage of struggle. The world situation is changing so seriously, and the rise and fall of the nation are so precarious. We should be keenly aware that the world can only respect us if we trust and respect ourselves. Only then can we stand in the world and eliminate aggression. Compatriots across the country must especially understand the importance of consolidating the foundation of the nation. If the nation ceases to exist, everything is empty. If the nation loses its freedom, everything has no anchor. We must establish a national concept based on the interests of the entire nation as the basis for unity. Only then will unity have strength, and only then will victory be assured. Our revolution and nation-building originally had a consistent goal. We should sincerely implement the Three Principles of the People and take on the mission of our time. Second, we must promote the national spirit and establish the foundation for revival. Our great cause of nation-building must be based on the foundation of war. I believe that in our nation-building, material construction is certainly important, but spiritual construction is even more important. With spirit, material construction will not succeed. At present, we are not only lagging behind in science and technology and have poor material construction, but also in spirit, we are not keeping up with the needs of the times. The so-called spiritual construction requires us to first realize that we compatriots have a sacred responsibility and obligation to the country and the nation. We must sacrifice everything to take on this responsibility, thoroughly reflect and strive for progress, and fulfill the duties of citizens. We must be responsible and disciplined in order to achieve success in nation-building. We must be ethical and have a sense of shame in order to remedy past shortcomings and reverse the trend of decline and inertia. In particular, I want to remind our civil servants who have administrative responsibilities to keenly feel their responsibilities and understand that officials are public servants of the people, absolutely ensuring that they do not neglect their duties or make mistakes, that they are worthy of the country and the people. And our compatriots must also jointly be responsible for upholding discipline and fulfilling their duties in order to establish the foundation for our revived nation. Compatriots, do not think that these are ordinary words of exhortation. You must know that after such unprecedented sacrifices and lessons, if we still cannot thoroughly realize and restore the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation, and do not understand morality or have a sense of shame, then the nation will not become a nation, the nation will not become a nation. Even if we win the war, nation-building will still fail. This is a case of failing when success is within reach, and our generation of compatriots will become sinners for thousands of years. Third, we must grasp the key points of nation-building and complete the great revolutionary cause. There are many categories of nation-building work, but the most important are military affairs, education, and economy. These are the three major elements that constitute the vitality of a modern country. Therefore, our military officers at all levels, our people in the education sector, and our civil servants and technical experts engaged in economic construction are the foundation of our nation-building work. The enrichment of combat power and the opening up of the nation's bright future all depend on you to take responsibility. (To be continued)"</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in London Commemorate the 4th Anniversary of the War of Resistance with Grand Occasion - Over 300 Overseas Chinese Attended, Ambassador Gu Weijun Attended and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>London, Special Dispatch, 8th - Overseas Chinese in London grandly commemorated the 4th Anniversary in the past two days. Over 300 Overseas Chinese attended yesterday's commemoration meeting, which was chaired by Guo Bingwen, who introduced Ambassador Gu Weijun to deliver a speech. Mr. Gu first gave a brief review of the past history, then analyzed the current situation in China and the international situation, and firmly believed that final victory would belong to China. The reasons are: (1) China has a wise and decisive leader, President Chiang Kai-shek; (2) The Chinese people are united and determined to win; (3) China's political and economic status has been enhanced after four years of war. China can not only obtain spiritual assistance from all parties today, but also obtain material assistance from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and the allied territories. Next, Yu Ming and Wang Jingchun also delivered speeches successively. After the speeches, a war film was shown. When The Times commented on the film, it said that the film fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of China from the era of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the present day.</p>
<p>London, Special Dispatch, 8th - At noon today, overseas Chinese held another commemoration meeting at the Chinese Embassy, where Ambassador Gu delivered a speech.</p>
<p>London, Special Dispatch, 8th - The British Aid China Committee hosted a banquet tonight to commemorate the 4th anniversary of China's War of Resistance and to welcome the new Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun. Many dignitaries from various countries attended, all eager to hear Ambassador Gu's first public speech. They all showed the greatest enthusiasm for China's War of Resistance and unanimously expressed their hope that China would win quickly. The banquet was presided over by Lord Cecil, President of the International Anti-Aggression Congress. Among the distinguished guests were Soviet Ambassador Maisky and his wife, Upper House Councilor Lord Listowel, Lower House Councilor Baker, Chinese Minister to the Netherlands Jin Wensi, Financial Secretary Guo Bingwen and his wife, and Chen Weicheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy. Chairman Cecil claimed that China was sacrificing for freedom. The four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union are now united in the great four-corner war for freedom. They will continue to fight until the law, justice and freedom of the whole world are restored. Cecil continued, saying that Ambassador Gu is not only our friend and comrade, but also the ambassador of a major Eastern power. We should work together for peace. If the advice we have put forward in the past has been accepted by the world, then today's world must be more suitable for human survival. At this point, Ambassador Gu stood up and delivered a speech, saying that his predecessor, Guo Taiqi, has a very rich record in his work and is admired by us. The successors should make even greater efforts so as not to fail the great achievements made by their predecessors. Mr. Gu expressed his deep gratitude to the Aid China Committee for its efforts to help Chinese refugees, and said that at present, the Chinese government and the people can unite as one, using the strength of national unity to attack the invaders and prevent them from making further progress. The bloodshed of the Chinese people is not only used to save the country, but also makes a significant contribution to world peace. If China had adopted a policy of non-resistance, Japan would have long since shifted its aggressive blade to the European and American territories in the Far East. No matter what kind of adventure Japan takes, it is currently deeply mired in Asia due to China's War of Resistance and cannot extricate itself. Mr. Gu also said that the Chinese people greatly admire the firm unity and heroic passion of the British people. As for the Soviet Union, although it is currently being invaded, its Red Army and people are fighting bravely. The President of the United States has great wisdom and outstanding leadership talent. At present, these four major countries are already in the same boat. The closer their cooperation, the more reliable their final victory will be. If the United States accelerates its assistance to China, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, the sooner the victory of the three countries will come. China firmly believes that democratic countries can provide China with greater assistance to suit the importance of the Far Eastern front. China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are strongly united, in sync, and marching towards freedom. They will surely achieve final victory in both Europe and Asia.</p>

Those who lived downstairs where it rolled over were either killed or injured, while those who lived upstairs were spared. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Indicates the Elimination of U.S. Defense Boundaries - Three Locations Outside the Western Hemisphere Are Extremely Important to American Security</h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters dispatch, 7th - President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the United States' security interests extend far beyond the Atlantic and that there are a total of three locations outside the Western Hemisphere that are extremely important to the defense of the New World. However, the President refused to clearly delineate the boundaries of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, only clarifying that the only effective way to defend the Western Hemisphere is to protect important locations. He also declined to discuss whether the important interests of the United States in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands have been threatened, and whether Iceland is outside the scope of the Western Hemisphere, saying that he had studied the matter of delineation for several weeks but abandoned it due to its ineffectiveness. The President also declined to indicate whether American troops have been sent to Greenland, saying that such matters are military secrets, and that the occupation of Iceland was a preemptive move that military strategists considered reasonable.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters dispatch, 9th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday while receiving reporters that there are important places in the ocean that are not related to defense, but outside the hemispheric boundary, there are still extremely important points. Therefore, it is impossible to draw an imaginary line and place buoys on it to serve as markers. The President's remarks have eliminated the hemispheric boundary in American defenses. The President then indirectly answered the question of whether he had received concrete intelligence of Germany's advance into Iceland, saying that he did not think he could answer it concretely, but that before the war, one could put oneself in the place of others and determine what they planned to do. Intelligence sometimes exists and sometimes does not. A reporter asked, "Do you think that others will take action towards the Azores or Cape Verde?" The President replied that he could not predict it. When asked whether there were American troops in Greenland, the President replied that answering this question would reveal military intelligence.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Openly Suggest Fortifying West African Outposts</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - American newspapers are almost unanimous in their support of the President's actions in Britain and Iceland, and openly suggest that the United States should fortify its outposts in West Africa in the future. The Washington Post stated that in addition to relieving Britain of its burden, President Roosevelt should also take the lead over Germany in preparing for action on the West African coast, so that "we can make the French understand that we are serious." The Cleveland Plain Dealer stated that "only stubborn isolationists would criticize America's actions in Iceland. The necessity of this move is widely recognized, but this scene still needs to be completed. Dakar still needs to be taken over, and then the thoroughfare to the Western Hemisphere will be thoroughly defended." The Newark Evening Star stated that "America's occupation of Iceland is the most significant blow that Hitler has suffered in the Atlantic war." The San Francisco Chronicle stated that "the Iceland matter is indeed surprising to Americans, but it must be understood that it is unavoidable, for we cannot hope that Hitler would have no intention of using this base." The Boston Globe stated that "Germany has received a warning from this, and knows that the defenses of the Western Hemisphere are not just empty talk." The Knoxville News Sentinel stated that "the occupation of Iceland seems to be another step towards war." The St. Louis Globe-Democrat stated that "the President's decision has greatly reduced the possibility that we might avoid entering the war, but if the US government's diplomatic procedures are implemented, then entering the war is even more unavoidable." The New York Post stated that "this is an insurance policy to prevent foreign attacks from endangering the American continent." The New York Sun stated that "the United States is now in a position where it does not want its commander-in-chief to wait until Congress confirms a threat before taking steps that are urgently needed for national defense." Other newspapers also stated that this is an appropriate way to deal with Nazi forces, and is the most exciting move since the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - When President’s Secretary O'Leary yesterday received newspaper reporters, they inquired about a London dispatch received by the New York Times stating that isolationist Senator Wheeler last week hinted at the US military occupation of Iceland, resulting in the pre-disclosure of military secrets regarding British military actions, and that Britain was greatly angered by this. O'Leary replied that the London dispatch contained language that was quite impartial, such as that German forces could take advantage of this situation and cause British and American soldiers to encounter slaughter. O'Leary did not answer questions regarding the rumored remarks by the newly appointed Middle East Commander-in-Chief, General Auchinleck, that American manpower was needed to win the victory. He only said that he had recently heard from London that British Prime Minister Churchill had stated that the United States should provide war materiel to Britain, and that Britain should be responsible for the war, and he believed that Auchinleck would obey the Prime Minister. A certain reporter instructed Wheeler that he had good information regarding the occupation of Iceland. Molay said that Wheeler was just guessing correctly. As for the rumors from London about the establishment of an air route between Iceland and the United States, he had not heard of them. Havas, New York, 9th - Senator Wheeler, having predicted the US occupation of Iceland last Thursday, yesterday declared that in the near future, the French West African city of Dakar and the Atlantic islands of the Azores and Cape Verde will be successively occupied.</p>
<h3>Churchill Predicts British and American Naval Cooperation</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that the US military occupation of Iceland is one of the most significant events since the outbreak of the war. British troops are still stationed on the island, and he predicted that the British and American navies may cooperate to ensure the arrival of supplies and reinforcements to Iceland. The Prime Minister emphasized that this matter is completely integrated with British interests and, on behalf of the House of Commons and the government, welcomed the US military.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - According to responsible sources, the British troops currently in Iceland will remain stationed there, so it is expected that British and American troops will cooperate to resist any possible German attempt at invasion.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 9th - A commentator from the National Broadcasting Company broadcast from Reykjavik, Iceland last night that the US troops stationed in Iceland officially landed on the morning of the 8th and were greeted. According to the commentator, who identified himself as a British official, the British troops in Iceland were amazed by the equipment, quality, and quantity of the US military. He said that the US ship escort carrying the troops arrived on Monday afternoon, and British officials boarded the ship to visit the US commander. Only a few of the newly arrived US troops landed on the evening of the 7th, and began landing on the morning of the 8th, and a grand welcoming banquet was held.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the arrival of US troops in British Guiana, Trinidad, and Iceland is welcomed by London, which recognizes this as a sign that the Western Hemisphere is taking the initiative to move its defensive outposts forward to meet the Nazi threat before being attacked. Another piece of evidence that this defensive concept is gradually becoming stronger is the plan proposed by Uruguay, which has been fully approved by the United States. This plan stipulates that if one American country is at war with a non-American country, it will not be considered a belligerent and may use the naval, land, and air force bases belonging to neighboring countries. London believes that the acceptance or rejection of this plan by other American republics can indicate that they are aware of the common danger. The existence of a common danger in the Americas is undeniable, as President Roosevelt's rigorous actions have proven.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 9th - Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King commented on the US military's stationing in Iceland, saying that this is a very significant move, and he was delighted to hear that the US Navy was stationed in Iceland.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 9th - Willkie stated yesterday that he deeply agreed with President Roosevelt's dispatch of troops to occupy Iceland, and hoped that the government's next step would be to use the navy to protect the transport of war materiel to Britain, so as not to be sunk by German ships.</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Actually Accuse the United States of Attacking Europe's Back</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 9th - Berlin authorities stated yesterday that the landing of US troops in Iceland is an unreasonable attack on Europe and an aggression against this neutral small country, which is completely unjustified. Mr. Roosevelt only wishes to bring about a closer proximity to the European war zone because of this. Mr. Roosevelt deliberately moved the United States closer to the battlefield where sharp weapons and war materiel are used, so Mr. Roosevelt should be fully responsible for this action. Berlin authorities declared that since May of this year, Iceland has been considered a war zone, so Mr. Roosevelt is difficult to avoid all the consequences arising from international law. According to Mr. Weissforth, the threat of Germany to Iceland, which drove the US military to occupy the island, is a deceptive remark. However, Iceland protested to Britain when Britain occupied the island, and the Icelandic Prime Minister stated when meeting with reporters that he had also lodged a similar protest against the American aggression. This news has been recorded in American newspapers. Mr. Roosevelt's statement that the United States occupied Iceland with the prior consent of the Icelandic Prime Minister is completely fabricated. The occupation of Iceland actually makes Mr. Roosevelt far from the Monroe Doctrine, and harms the American people. Mr. Roosevelt's action is a trampling on the doctrine that he personally promoted and claimed to be his follower. In order to spread his imperialism, Mr. Roosevelt even used force against a small country with no resistance, so that the United States could interfere in the Eastern Hemisphere. Just when Europe is striving to eliminate the threat of Bolshevism to the world, Mr. Roosevelt disregarded everything and attacked Europe from the rear, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Rome issued a semi-official statement yesterday stating that Italy regards the US occupation of Iceland with indifference. The statement concluded that Italy regards this step as an intervention in European territorial waters. Roosevelt, by sending ships into the lock zone, has already borne a heavy responsibility, and now he has broken the solemn promise he made to the American people to win the election, which is that he would not send American troops outside of American territory.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 9th - Italian observers stated that the US armed occupation of Iceland is to delineate a broad area so that supplies to Britain can sail unhindered. Italians also stated that the US action is no longer considered to be expanding the "safe zone," but is "an official intervention in European waters." Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote, "The US military's occupation of Iceland is more than enough to directly invite disaster to the United States."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 9th - Tokyo's Japanese-language newspapers unanimously believe today that the US occupation of Iceland is another step by the United States to bring the entire country closer to war. The newspapers stated that President Roosevelt took this action by taking advantage of the opportunity of the Soviet-German war. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an editorial in its usual style, stating that the explanation for the US occupation of Iceland is just an excuse. Based on this view, they should also be able to announce the stationing of US troops in Siberia, because that place is adjacent to Alaska.</p>
<h3>US Aid to the Soviet Union Plan is Proceeding Smoothly, Both Sides are Currently Discussing Details</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th - Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the methods for satisfying the Soviet Union's request for US military raw material assistance are currently proceeding smoothly. Welles stated that the Japanese government has not yet announced its opinion on the shipment of US war materiel to Vladivostok. Newspaper reports earlier said that Japan will seriously pay attention to this type of freight, because it may contribute to the expansion of the European war to the Far East.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that Soviet Ambassador to the US Umansky has consulted with State Department officials on the Soviet Union's procurement from the US, and that details are currently being discussed. From this, it can be seen that the US aid to the Soviet Union plan is currently proceeding quickly and efficiently. Welles also replied to other questions, stating that the United States has not received any official information that can confirm the claim that Japan will set up a safety zone around its islands to cut off traffic to Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Icelandic Parliament Convenes Special Meeting</h3>
<p>United Press, Reykjavik, 9th - Icelandic Prime Minister Jónasson, after learning that President Roosevelt had issued his declaration to Congress, immediately issued a proclamation. The Icelandic people and newspapers were very calm upon hearing this news. Jónasson read the original text of President Roosevelt's declaration, and explained the details and conditions of the occupation. He also announced that the Parliament will hold a special meeting on the 9th, and the government will give a detailed explanation.</p>
<h3>Winant Advocates Adjustment, British and American Social Efforts</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - At the annual meeting of the National Council of Social Services held in London yesterday, US Ambassador Winant gave a speech, advocating the adjustment of social efforts between the US and the UK, saying that since the UK and the US have tried to adjust their efforts in military and material aspects, their social efforts should also be adjusted, because when we preserve [illegible], we should also try to develop life. He hoped that people sent from one country to another are closely related to the social welfare of both countries.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Plans to Request Funds Again, Expanding the Army and Navy</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 9th - Well-informed members of Congress issued a message yesterday that President Roosevelt and his aides plan to request another $5 billion to $6 billion from Congress. The uses are: (1) About $4 billion for expanding the army's funding; (2) $1 billion for building new warships to strengthen the navies in both oceans. The ships built with this money do not include battleships, but only destroyers and cruisers; (3) Further increase the cost of materiel aid to Britain, this money is in addition to the original allocation of $7 billion.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Among American Countries, Mediating South American Disputes, US, Argentina, and Brazil are Exchanging Views, The Peru-Ecuador Border is Peaceful</h3>

<p>Havas, Capital of Ecuador, 9th - According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of National Defense, the Peruvian border areas were generally peaceful today.</p>
<p>United Press, Buenos Aires, 9th - La Prensa reported today that Peru's military preparations against Ecuador are being carried out in cooperation with Japan, which is supplying armaments.</p>
<h3>British Spy for Germany Executed</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 9th - Engineer Amos Long, 38 years old, was executed by beheading today in Wandsworth Prison. This is the first time that a British person has been executed under the Treachery Act. Long was sentenced to death on May 8 after a secret trial in criminal court. During the trial, only officials and necessary witnesses were allowed on the scene, in addition to police jurors and defense lawyers. The criminal court implemented security measures during the trial, and the doors leading to the court were also locked. The details were not disclosed to the press. It is only known that the 10 male jurors and 2 female jurors all found Long guilty of two counts of crime. The trial lasted six hours. Long's appeal against the death sentence was unsuccessful. The Home Office announced that Long had been recruited by a German spy agency through a German consulate in the United States a few months ago. Long was later arrested after returning to England. Long is the fifth British person to be sentenced to death under the Treachery Act, but Long is the first to be executed.</p>

<h3>German and Italian Women and Children Evacuated from the Dutch East Indies Will Pass Through Shanghai, Expected to Arrive Tomorrow and Immediately Go to Japan for Temporary Residence, Four Japanese Ships Have Been Requisitioned</h3>
<p>German and Italian women and children residing in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, were suddenly ordered by the government to evacuate this time, and took the Japanese ship Asama Maru to Kobe, Japan. The ship departed from the Dutch East Indies on the 4th of this month and is expected to enter the port tomorrow and dock at the Yangshupu Wharf. All German and Italian refugees on board, except those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai and land here, will be transported to Japan.</p>
<p>German and Italian Adult Men Detained in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Since the economic negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan have stalled, the situation in the South China Sea has suddenly become tense. All German and Italian adult men of conscription age residing in the Dutch East Indies have been detained by the Dutch East Indies government in accordance with wartime emergency laws, to be released after the end of the war. As a result, the general women and children have no means of livelihood, so the governments of the respective countries ordered them to evacuate to Japan for temporary refuge. After consultation with the Japanese authorities, the Asama Maru was requisitioned to transport the evacuated German and Italian women and children. Among them, Germans accounted for 60% and Italians accounted for 40%. All travel expenses are subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow for a Two-Night Stay</p>
<p>The Asama Maru originally sailed on the Pacific route, and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and then sail to the US via Japan. Later, because it was ordered to carry German and Italian women and children away from the Dutch East Indies, it rushed to Batavia from Manila. As for those originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Japan or the UK on the Asama Maru, because the ship has been requisitioned to sail exclusively between the Dutch East Indies and Japan, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha changed to dispatching the Tatsuta Maru to replace the Asama Maru to the US on the 3rd. The Asama Maru was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Dutch East Indies today, but due to a hurricane en route, it will have to enter the port tomorrow afternoon. It will stay in Shanghai for two nights and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the 12th. The ship will stop running on the original route and will be managed by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Four Japanese Ships Have Been Requisitioned</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry in Manila, in addition to the Asama Maru, the Japanese government has requisitioned three other ships, the Mikawa Maru and two other Japanese cargo ships that usually sail between Manila. The two ships were originally scheduled to arrive in Manila on the 7th, but now they have canceled their voyages to Manila. The number of ships that usually sail to Manila that have been requisitioned has reached four. The Japanese government's measure of requisitioning ships is similar in nature to the British government's requisition of American mail ships. Because the situation in the Far East is currently turbulent, Japan may launch another war, resulting in military transport requiring more ships.</p>
<h3>President Pierce Arrives Today, American Merchant Ships' Schedules Are Kept Secret</h3>
<p>The American President Lines President Pierce mail ship, returning to Shanghai from Luzon, is expected to arrive in port this afternoon and leave Shanghai tomorrow morning to return to the US in response to requisition. From now on, the schedules of American merchant ships may not be announced in advance in order to seek maritime safety.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. de Vits, Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. de Vits, has been staying in Hong Kong for many days after flying from Chongqing. It is heard that the ambassador left Hong Kong by ship the day before yesterday and will arrive in port this afternoon. As for the ship the ambassador is on, it cannot be determined because the shipping company refuses to announce it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesman Comments on the US Occupation of Iceland, Believes it is a Further Step Towards Entering the War, Refuses to Answer Questions About Japanese Actions</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that Colonel Akiyama, the Japanese Army spokesman in Shanghai, stated yesterday (the 8th) afternoon while receiving newspaper reporters that President Roosevelt's dispatch of the Navy to Iceland is not just for a summer vacation, but is actually a further step towards entering the war. If Japan sends armed troops to the Dutch East Indies (Japan has no intention of doing so), its importance will be the same as the US Navy going to Iceland. Iceland has declared independence, and the United States has not participated in the war.</p>
<p>No Guarantees About Japanese Movements Either</p>
<p>When asked whether Japan's guarantee not to send troops to the Dutch East Indies can also apply to southern French Vietnam and Thailand, the spokesman replied that just as the United States had not announced the dispatch of the Navy to Iceland before, Japan cannot issue any guarantees about future actions. When asked why Japan opposes the transport of American materials to Vladivostok, the spokesman replied that Japan is quite concerned about the spread of the Soviet-German war to the Far East, and the unloading of war materials in Vladivostok may extend the war to the Far East. When asked whether Japan will take countermeasures if American ships transport war materials to Vladivostok, the spokesman did not answer. When asked what actions Japan will take if American goods are transported to Vladivostok by Soviet ships, the spokesman also remained silent.</p>
<h3>The Rehabilitation Public Bonds Will Be Drawn Today, The Four Banks Accepting Discount Payments for Customs-Guaranteed Domestic Bonds</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the credit of domestic bonds, the Ministry of Finance has arranged for the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank of China to discount and credit for the payment of principal and interest on all customs-guaranteed bonds.

<h3>Huangpu River Giant Tide Next Month, As High as the Bund Embankment, Total Rainfall Last Month Was Ten Inches</h3>
<p>Another new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, but it is still far from Shanghai. As for tidal flooding, according to predictions by the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, there will be a giant tide next month that will be as high as the Bund embankment.</p>
<p>Hurricane</p>
<p>According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, another new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, located at 18 degrees north latitude and 142 degrees east longitude, far from Shanghai. It is currently moving in a northwest direction. The wind force is unknown. If the hurricane does not dissipate midway and continues to advance rapidly in this direction, the Chinese coast will be attacked.</p>
<p>Tides</p>
<p>According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the Shanghai Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the Huangpu River has had high tides for several days, especially the tide at 12:23 PM yesterday, which was the highest, reaching 11 feet and 4 inches, and is expected to return to normal starting from the 20th. However, according to the Bureau's prediction, there will be a giant tide in the Huangpu River in early August, with a height of nearly 13 feet, as high as the riverbank.</p>
<p>Rainfall</p>
<p>Heavy rains fell in late July, with a total amount of 10.08 inches, which is one of the months with the highest rainfall records. The heaviest rainfall was on the 25th of last month, reaching 4.6 inches. Although there was light rain on the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th of this month, the total rainfall was only 3 tenths of an inch.</p>
<h3>Japanese Searched Haig Road, Attempting to Arrest Chinese, Caused by a Misunderstanding Due to Similar Names</h3>
<p>On the mornings of the 5th and 6th of this month, the Japanese, together with the French police, searched No. 6 and No. 18, Lane 857, Haig Road twice, reportedly wanting to arrest a Chinese man. However, only a maid was arrested at that time, and no other discoveries were made. It is heard that the Japanese action was because they found that the name of a man in the two houses was similar to the person they wanted to arrest, so they acted quietly and suddenly went to search for him on the mornings of the 5th and 6th, but the result was that they did not find any objects. It is now known that it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Beautifying the French Concession</h3>
<p>In order to beautify the French Concession, the French Concession Police Authority had previously made strict regulations on the style of houses and roads. Now that summer has arrived, many shops often build awnings along the road, which hinders pedestrian traffic, so it has ordered all police stations to inspect and patrol the area, and those who encounter such shading that affects traffic are ordered to correct it, otherwise they will be punished according to regulations. As for the households in the alleys, they often hang clothes across the street, and they are also hung low, so pedestrians have to lower their heads to pass. The Bureau also prohibits this, and violators will be fined 5 yuan each time.</p>
<h3>After the Resumption of Bulk Purchases of Foreign Rice, Sales are Verified and Issued Accordingly, About 5,000 Tons Ordered in Two Days, The Quality of the Second Batch of Rice is Similar to the First Batch</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council resumed bulk purchases of foreign rice by various grain shops, it proves that the Hong Kong authorities can continuously supply flat-priced Hong Kong rice to the city. The various grain shops, because the authorities have resumed bulk purchases and the legal profits set are very generous, are rushing to order the second batch of foreign rice in large quantities from the authorities. In the past two days, the total number was about 5,000 tons. Rice shops mostly apply to the Litchi Foreign Firm for distribution of the rice they need for sale, with a daily quantity of about 10,000 bags. The authorities approve these applications in accordance with the actual sales volume reported by each rice shop. According to a rice merchant, the quality of the second batch of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai is similar to that of the first batch and is quite suitable for consumption by the general public.</p>
<h3>Official Oath of Allegiance by Judges and Officials: Deadline for Submission Today. All Agencies and Legal Entities Comply. Supporters of the Free Movement Still Active</h3>
<p>The French personnel of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, Police Department, and consulates, following the official order issued on July 2nd by the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, have in the past few days submitted to their superiors oaths of allegiance to France and its leader, General Pétain.</p>
<p>Oath of Allegiance Limited to Eight Days</p>
<p>French officials have ordered French personnel in the French administrative organs of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to swear allegiance, with a deadline of eight days, expiring today (the 10th). The period has been sufficient, as most French personnel immediately signed the oaths upon receiving the Ambassador's order. Therefore, it is expected that by today's deadline, there will be virtually no one who has not sworn allegiance, and it will hardly be necessary to implement the Ambassador's order to dismiss those who fail to swear allegiance by the deadline.</p>
<p>Rumor of Oath by All French Nationals</p>
<p>It was reported when the Ambassador issued the order that non-official French sources said the Ambassador might soon order all French nationals in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou to swear allegiance. Those who do not comply, the Ambassador could strip of their civil rights on the grounds that they are engaged in activities harmful to France. However, the French Consulate in Shanghai has not yet indicated that the oath order will soon be expanded to all French nationals in the city. According to French sources, the French personnel of the Municipal Council and the Police Department are expected to swear allegiance in their entirety, as the threat of dismissal for non-compliance cannot be ignored, leaving no alternative but to swear allegiance.</p>
<p>Free Movement Continues to Progress</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to French nationals in the city who support General de Gaulle's Free French movement, they will continue to secretly follow the leaders of the Free French movement in the city. In reality, signing the oath will not affect the sentiments of the majority of French nationals at present. When necessary, they will disregard the oath.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Express Train Suddenly Derails</h3>
<p>According to passengers who returned to Shanghai from Changzhou yesterday, at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the first express train from Shanghai to Nanjing derailed near the section between Danyang and Lingkou, west of Changzhou, around midnight, due to a sudden explosion of a landmine. The explosion destroyed several passenger cars, and the locomotive (the "dragon head") was overturned beside the tracks.</p>
<p>Traffic Interrupted</p>
<p>More than ten zhang of sleepers were destroyed. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. After the incident, at 8:35 AM the same morning, when the second ordinary passenger train departed, Shanghai had not yet received a report. It was not until the train reached Changzhou Station around 2:00 PM that it was stopped from proceeding by Japanese soldiers stationed there. Passengers disembarked, and the station ordered them to repurchase tickets to return. Those unwilling to repurchase tickets temporarily stayed with relatives and friends nearby.</p>
<p>Location of Mine Explosion</p>
<p>However, according to another report, at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the first express train from Shanghai to Nanjing derailed near Qixia Mountain, with the passenger cars and locomotive suddenly overturned. The cause was that three to four zhang of the track had been sabotaged by guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Commercial Bank Check Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Shanghai commercial banks, considering the abundance of floating capital and the lack of proper investment channels, and to avoid the waste of interest, have adjusted and lowered both fixed and current interest rates according to market conditions. They have also introduced a small check usage fee and stipulated the minimum balance for interest accrual on current accounts. The notices from various banks are recorded below: (1) Zhejiang Industrial Bank: "To our valued customers, due to the frequent transactions of current account holders using checks and deposit slips, and the increasing cost of paper and printing, our bank, in order to cover costs, will charge each account a handling fee starting from July 1, 1941. The fee will be calculated based on the number of checks used, at 2.50 yuan per book of 25 checks, which will be debited from the account at any time by the bank, without issuing replacement checks, to save on procedures. We hereby inform you and request your understanding." (2) Shanghai New China Trust &amp; Savings Bank: "To our valued customers, for check current deposits at our bank, starting from the next period in 1941, balances below 500 yuan per day will not accrue interest. Balances of 500 yuan or more will be subject to the original interest rate, and interest will still be calculated per 100 yuan unit on the interest settlement date. We hereby inform you and request your understanding." However, the measures for interest rate reductions and other matters are determined by each commercial bank individually and are not uniformly decided by the Bankers Association.</p>

According to the company, the Narutomaru was originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 5:00 PM today, but due to the lack of approval from the Japanese naval authorities, it was still unable to sail yesterday and was moved from the Old Bund wharf to pontoons 26 and 27.</p>

<p>Various movie theaters, large and small, in the British and French concessions of this city have, since May of this year, received threatening letters from Yao Qin, the head of the "Iron Green Corps," demanding so-called "protection fees," ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per month, depending on the size of the theater. If payment was made, a "Quiet" sign would be posted at the ticket office of the theater, and representatives would be sent carrying four beer bottles, from the No. 13 Bund pier, Bobu to Gaomiao, hiring a rickshaw to Jinjiaqiao, where someone would come to negotiate; otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. Some theaters, out of fear, paid the extortion, while others ignored it and reported it to the police. The Xinguang Grand Theater on Ningbo Road and the Great Shanghai Theater on Yu Qiaqing Road were attacked with smoke bombs for failing to pay. Afterward, the Xinguang Grand Theater paid 300 yuan. On June 14, the Guanghua Grand Theater on Aidaoya Road and the Xihai Grand Theater on Xinzha Road received the same threatening letters, instructing them to pay in Pudong. Upon learning of this, the Xinzha Police Station dispatched Chinese detectives Yang Peizhang, Ruan Yao, Ma Zhongrong, and Wang Shidong, together with personnel from the Japanese and Italian military headquarters, and arrested the suspects, Ye Jinbao (aka Jiang Ya Zi, 18 years old, from Ningbo), Zhang Ren (26 years old, from Tongzhou), and Wang Guilin (only 14 years old, from Pudong), at Jinjiaqiao in Pudong. They were brought to the police station, and the "Iron Green Corps" seal, four "Corps Leader" Yao Qin's chops, and many receipts were seized from No. 44, Lane 303, Qipu Road. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. It was found that the suspects had sent threatening letters to thirteen movie theaters: Guolian, Xinguang, Jincheng, Guanghua, Xihai, Mingxing, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Great Shanghai, Dahua, Great Guangming, Central, and Jindu, extorting amounts ranging from 150 to 500 yuan per theater, obtaining a considerable sum. Yesterday morning, witnesses were summoned, and Ye Jinbao and the others were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin detailed the above circumstances and questioned the defendants, who admitted that all the cases were masterminded by Bai Erzhong, who is at large, and that they were only acting under his direction. All the threatening letters were drafted by Bai Erzhong and copied by Ye Jinbao, totaling about eighteen letters. Subsequently, Judge Shi briefly questioned the representatives of the theaters and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yi Tai Hing Coal Shop Nearly Robbed: Police Alarm Scares Away Thieves</h3>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, the Yi Tai Hing Coal Shop at No. 182 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession was suddenly broken into by four robbers dressed in short clothes and armed with handguns. Because only a gatekeeper, Li Zhan'ao (from Tianjin), was stationed at the entrance, the robbers monitored Li's actions. Two robbers entered the accounting room and were about to start searching when an employee realized that a robbery was in progress and quickly fled, disappearing without a trace. By the time a large number of detectives from the police station arrived, the robbers had already disappeared, and the shop suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Provisional Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Council Provisional Board held a routine meeting in the Director-General's office and discussed various reports from the Municipal Council committees.</p>
<h3>Truck Swerves to Avoid Overturned Cart, Crashing into Restaurant Wall</h3>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, a truck (No. 15843), fully loaded with yarn bales, was traveling east on Aidaoya Road when it reached the Chengdu Road intersection. At the same time, an empty overturned cart was turning west into Chengdu Road. To avoid a collision, the truck braked suddenly and lost control, crashing into the Hongyunlou Restaurant at the intersection of Beidi'ao Road in the French Concession, creating a large hole in the restaurant's kitchen wall. The yarn bales on the truck also fell to the ground. The empty overturned cart took advantage of the situation and fled. The truck driver believed that the incident was due to the negligence of the traffic police on duty, while the traffic police pointed out that the driver had taken the wrong route. The responsibility remains to be investigated by the police. (Photo by Dahua)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Accounting Director Detained by Japanese Sentry: Stopped from Crossing Bridge, Car Impounded, Apology to Japanese Military Demanded</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Mr. Du Ying, the accounting director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department, was driving his wife back to their home in Hongkou around 11:30 PM yesterday (the 8th) when they were stopped by a Japanese sentry at the northern end of the Waibaidu Bridge. The sentry asked Mr. and Mrs. Du to get out of the car for inspection, which they agreed to do.</p>
<p>Suspicion Over Eggs</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers searched the car and found a bag of eggs on the seat. Suspecting that they might not be real eggs, they carefully inspected each one. Mr. Du immediately took an egg and broke it to show them. However, the Japanese soldiers still did not believe him and continued to search. Mr. Du took another egg and threw it away casually to show that there was no danger. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers accused Mr. Du of throwing the egg at them, leading to an argument.</p>
<p>Car Impounded</p>
<p>At that time, a Western police officer from the Hongkou Police Station arrived and led Mr. and Mrs. Du away from the bridge. The Japanese soldiers pushed Mr. Du's car to the side of the road and said that to retrieve the car, he would have to apologize to the Marine Corps Headquarters this morning (the 9th). According to Mr. Du, who spoke to reporters this morning, he had no intention of apologizing to the Japanese military headquarters, but if both sides were at fault, he would be willing to exchange apologies with a Japanese military officer.</p>
<h3>Peculiar Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>I recently met a classmate whom I hadn't seen for ten years. When I told him that I had traveled through the Northwest, Southwest, and French Indochina, he seemed very touched and said, "I am now the father of four children. I grew up in Shanghai and have never left Shanghai a single step. I am afraid I will not have the opportunity to travel outside in the future. What do you think of Shanghai?"</p>
<p>I have been in Shanghai for over five months, and I always feel uneasy. What kind of place is Shanghai? I dare not say until now. However, compared to other places, it does seem to have its peculiar characteristics.</p>
<p>It is said that during the Taiping Rebellion, many people fled to "Shanghai," which was still a remote place at that time, for fear of the "long-haired rebels." When I was young, I also saw many relatives and friends living in the countryside move to Shanghai due to wars or bandits. In the past ten years, although there have been wars here, in this "peculiar Shanghai," except for occasional injuries from bombs or stray bullets, the prosperous city has always remained prosperous.</p>
<p>Many foreign travelers, stepping off ocean liners, stay in Shanghai for a few months, and then go back to tell their friends, "China is such and such a place, Chinese people are such and such a kind of people." There are also many compatriots, like my classmate, who have never left this peculiar Shanghai a single step. I am afraid that he might also think that China is just like Shanghai, and his compatriots are just like those he sees in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In fact, Shanghai is peculiar. Shanghai absolutely cannot represent the emerging China. It is better not to come to Shanghai to see the situation in China!</p>
<p>Some people say: Shanghai's cultural level is high. I think this may be true, but you cannot say that completely. Because of the many schools, Shanghai has countless universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and the number of students is considerable. However, I have also seen many university students who do not know where Guilin, Guiyang, and Lanzhou are: just like a reader wrote in the Continental Daily a few days ago, he said: Shanghai has many university students with shiny hair, fashionable suits, and memorized the names of American movie stars, but they only need to muddle through four years of schooling to get a diploma! I have also seen many Shanghai students who cannot write with a brush, or even write a simple letter home. This is because there are many places here where you don't need to use a brush or write Chinese characters. They will never need these in their lives, so they are too lazy to put in the effort.</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, you can see newspapers and movies promoting various countries, and you can also read news from all directions. It seems that this place can also be considered "free China"? But is it really free? I think no one will explain.</p>
<p>The "China Incident" has not yet ended. In Chongqing, the wartime capital of free China, there are several hours of air raid alerts every day, and people's lives are extremely tense. Shanghai is still a peaceful world of singing and dancing. The lives of some people are also tense, but they are tense about the rise and fall of gold prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices.</p>
<p>I met several fellow villagers who grew up in Shanghai in the inland areas. They said: Which place is more prosperous than Shanghai among Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guiyang, and Kunming? They seem very proud of being Shanghainese when talking about it in front of others. Shanghai is really a place you can't miss. In fact, I don't think being a Chinese in Shanghai is more glorious than being a Chinese elsewhere. However, Shanghai is indeed a place worth visiting. On this "ten-mile foreign concession," if you are happy to take a closer look, you will not worry about discovering many peculiar characteristics.</p>

<h3>Heinous Robbery and Murder Case on Dongchang Road, Pudong: Lu Daozhang Bound and Strangled, Valuables Looted</h3>
<p>A bizarre case of robbery and murder occurred in the early morning of the day before yesterday at No. 7, Renji Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong. The victim was Lu Daozhang, a practitioner of both Chinese and Western medicine. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Modest Savings</p>
<p>Lu Daozhang, a local Shanghainese, was 32 years old. He originally lived in Tangjiabang, east of Laobaidu in Pudong. He now rented a newly built building at No. 7, Renji Lane, Dongchang Road, where he practiced medicine. In recent years, his medical practice has flourished. His wife, Mrs. Lu, worked at the British American Tobacco factory in Pudong, leaving early and returning late, earning a monthly salary of over 100 yuan. In addition to practicing medicine, Lu also engaged in other businesses, so he had modest savings. The family lived a harmonious life.</p>
<p>Suddenly Strangled</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, his wife, Mrs. Lu, got up and went to work, taking the Yale lock on the door with her. (There were no servants in the Lu family.) Around 9:00 AM, a maternal uncle and cousin Zhang Miaogen came to visit and found Lu's door half-open. The medical room was empty, and no one was waiting inside. They waited for a long time, but there was no sound from upstairs. Realizing that something was wrong, they went upstairs to investigate and found Lu with his hands tied to the side of the sun deck stairs and his feet also bound. His head was wrapped in a towel, and his neck was surrounded by several strands of cotton yarn rope. They were shocked and immediately untied him, but his body was ice cold, and there was no way to revive him.</p>
<p>Money Looted</p>
<p>His wife, Mrs. Lu, learned of the tragedy when she got off work at noon and staggered home, weeping over his body. Upon inspection, the 3,000-odd yuan in legal tender and four bank passbooks stored in the box, as well as Lu's chop, were all missing. Also missing was the wristwatch worth 160 yuan that Lu was wearing. Judging from the situation, it seemed to be a case of murder for money.</p>
<p>Family Grieving</p>
<p>Lu's parents are still alive at his family home in Tangjiabang. His father, Lu Haitao, is nearly 60 years old and works as a farmer. His younger brother, Lu Chaosheng, is a businessman. Lu left behind three sons, the oldest being 11 years old, the second 8 years old, and the youngest still in his arms. The eight-member family relied entirely on Lu for support. This sudden misfortune has left the family without any means of support, causing heartbreak to all who hear of it.</p>
<h3>Dismembered Female Corpse Case Formally Indicted: Passbooks, Prostitution Pledges Unearthed, True Facts of the Case Cleared Up, Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>Zeng Liang, a 42-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 10, He'an Lane, Lane 139, Changsha Road, was murdered on the 7th of last month, and her body was dismembered and abandoned at the intersection of Baker Road and North He Road and in the Suzhou Creek. After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Chief Wang Runhe and Detective Chen Baozhong of the Xinzha Police Station, it was learned that the case was committed by the deceased's common-law husband, Sun Wang. The motive for the murder was that the deceased had considerable savings, so he did not hesitate to kill her and seize her property. Subsequently, Sun Wang's younger brother, Wang Gendi, his wife, Wang Ding, and Ma Jinhai, Wang Amao, and others were arrested in Suzhou and sent to the First Special Court, requesting detention. The details were reported in this newspaper. During the adjournment, the police investigated and learned that the deceased, Zeng Liang, whose original name was Liang Peiying, was likely from a brothel. According to the confessions of the arrested criminals, a passbook in the name of Liang Peiying, Yong'an Company account No. 28148, was found at the home of Ding Peiliang, a friend of Wang Gendi, at No. 5, Lane Shengqing, Wenjianshi Road, with a balance of 1,010.22 yuan. Also found was a pledge and loan agreement for 500 yuan from Shen Shiqing, mortgaging a 17-year-old girl, Xiuying, to the deceased to work as a prostitute for a period of five years. The whereabouts of the girl are currently unknown, but she could be rescued from the fire pit. In addition, 22 pawn tickets belonging to Gendi and his wife were found. The discovery of the above items conclusively proves that the defendants did commit the crime of murder for money. Therefore, when Judge Lin of the Criminal Division of the First Court held a hearing yesterday morning, police lawyer Ru Baoyi formally filed a public prosecution on the charge of murder. After questioning by Judge Chuan, a postponement of one week was ordered for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Detective's Shot Wounds Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 PM last night, a robber was intercepting a man's property near the Huade Road Police Hospital in Hongkou. The man shouted for help, and a Chinese detective, No. 570, who heard the cry, went to arrest the robber. Seeing the detective approaching, the robber fled empty-handed. The detective drew his gun and fired a shot. The robber escaped into the darkness, and was not hit by the shot. A stray bullet struck the left thigh of Liu Dechang (age 22, from Jiangbei), a rickshaw puller, who lives at No. 579 Yulin Road. The police summoned a car and sent Liu to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grains: Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council Dumps Rice, Rice Prices Still Difficult to Raise as Desired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the morning market for foreign rice showed no signs of weakening buying interest. Continuing the rising trend of recent days, speculators have not forgotten the possibility of further rises. The general increase of 6 yuan in the price of publicly sold Hong Kong rice is seen by followers as a reason for prices to rise further, without realizing that the market price of rice has already risen by two or three increments of 6 yuan, and the increase in the price of Hong Kong rice is only the first increment of 6 yuan. Furthermore, after the price increase, it is dumped in large quantities, with prices of 135.05 yuan and 136.5 yuan, which is much lower than the small bags of 154-155 yuan on the market. Therefore, once it is released in large quantities, the market is immediately suppressed. The current market price for small bags has fallen to 153.78 yuan, with a range of 156.2 yuan to 155.5 yuan. Siamese No. 2 ranges from 148 yuan to 147 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by about 1 yuan. The current rice price is initially falling, with most prices remaining flat and some slightly decreasing by a few cents to 1 yuan. The closing market prices are 133 yuan and 132.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 127 yuan for high-quality No. 2 to 122 yuan for small bags, 126 yuan for high-quality No. 2 Siam to 123.5 yuan, 129 yuan for Huowen to 128.5 yuan, 130 yuan for Jiafu rice, 135 yuan to 134.5 yuan for Mindang, and 128 yuan to 126 yuan for Xiaowen. Broken tip rice ranges from 99 yuan to 96.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice and fresh early and late rice from Nangang have been rising sharply in recent days. Carriers are feeling excited due to the considerable profits that can be made, and the arrival of goods is suddenly showing an increase. However, scarcity makes things valuable, and abundance makes them cheap. Sellers are loosening their selling intentions, and local shops and customers are no longer worried about missing out. Buying intentions are also declining sharply. Supply is temporarily exceeding demand, and it is difficult to maintain the high prices, with a return depreciation of more than 2 yuan immediately visible. The quoted prices, excluding particularly fresh goods, are still at 147 yuan, with ordinary fresh goods at 144 yuan and 143.5 yuan. The original Wuxi bags of overnight japonica, as the previous ones have not been fully collected, remain unchanged and are still priced at 134 yuan, and specially processed goods at 136 yuan.</p>
<p>Whether it is domestic or foreign glutinous rice, market goods are scarce, and the outlet is difficult to unblock, ultimately reaching a conclusion. Continuing sales of Hong Kong white yuan are at 126 yuan, then down to 123 yuan, glutinous tea at 115 yuan, and Jindan domestic glutinous rice at 118 yuan to 116 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Hovering with Stability</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market condition saw robust demand from local customers due to the recent high gold exchange rates and rising rice prices. Speculative buying and selling were active, showing strong interest. After a slight downturn in the afternoon the day before, the market opened strongly yesterday morning with increased buying interest. Yu Long Flour immediately rose by 20 cents, reaching $33.60, and Pao Tai Flour was at $34.30. However, some profit-taking occurred at higher prices, causing Jin Long Flour to ease to $33.45 and Pao Tai Flour to $34.20. Other brands included Five Swallows at $30.60 and Cai Shen Flour at $32.50. Overall, the market remained tight, with an estimated 20,000 bags changing hands. It is anticipated that the market may experience another period of consolidation.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading remained quiet. Currently, the new wheat is under control and prices are high, so sellers are holding firm. Asking prices have reached $46-47, while Japanese factories are still limited to original purchase prices, resulting in no available stock.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds in a Dilemma, Both Large and Small Denominations</h3>
<p>Public bonds on the unofficial market saw prices first decrease and then increase yesterday. Class C bonds briefly fell to a low of $70.08, but then recovered, showing an increase compared to the previous day and remaining in a hovering pattern. Analyzing the hovering trend, smaller denominations are hovering to a smaller and smaller degree, each time reaching new low prices, while larger denominations cannot exceed recent high prices, hovering downward. When this will end is difficult to predict. However, it is expected that there will not be drastic changes before interest payments. Yesterday morning, Yongchang bought Class E bonds, Forty-one Securities bought Class B bonds, and Yongkang bought Class A bonds, satisfying their demands. Tongshun and Xiexingyuan bought both Class B and C bonds, but Renchang sold heavily, supplying Class A, B, and C bonds in large quantities. Additionally, Shuntai, Tongkang, Yizhong, and Yitai also transacted. Class C bonds briefly broke the one-dollar mark, but were ultimately pulled back up. In the afternoon, Lianhe was a more active buyer, and Yongchang also had remaining strength to buy Class C bonds, raising the price to $1.75. Hongda, Renfeng, and Yichang took advantage of the higher prices to sell. As a result, prices for all classes except Class D, which did not trade, uniformly rebounded by 20-70 cents. The total value of transactions was approximately $1.7-1.8 million. A brief table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company stock were traded at a price of $22.75.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market at the Public Industries Exchange, after a brief period of activity, turned dull. The previously gained prices were subsequently lost again, with a very uncertain trend.</p>
<h3>Finance: HSBC Provides Supply; Foreign Exchange Buying Spree Ceases</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday: HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The gray market for British and American currencies initially tightened and then returned to level. Continuing the tight trend from the previous day, Chinese merchants and speculators engaged in aggressive buying, causing the August American exchange rate to tighten to $5.15625 and British gold to 3 pence 1 7/1875. Yenfeng small counters quoted the American exchange rate at $5.125, down by 0.0625. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly supplied currency at $5.1875, immediately halting the speculative buying spree. Hong Kong Electric also sold off, reaching a high of $5.21875 for hard currency. British gold also returned to level. In the end, both exchange rates were the same as the previous day's closing prices, with limited trading. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Closing: Spot Rates All Level</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign dispatches indicated that the British, American, and Indian silver markets were all level. Among exchange rates of various countries, the British exchange rate against Shanghai was down by 0.0625, while the rest were level. The opening prices in the domestic market were selling prices from banks, with the spot rate for British currency at 3 pence 1 8/1875 and American currency at $5.1875. After the opening, amidst the chaos, speculators aggressively bought the July-August rate at $5.1875, tightening it to $5.15625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. HSBC suddenly released August currency at $5.1875, stopping the speculative buying. Furthermore, Hong Kong Electric aggressively offered August currency at $5.21875. The Bank of England advantageously absorbed currency, making it difficult to settle the August rate at $5.21875 by the midday closing. The midday closing rates for both spot and August contracts were 3 pence 1 8/1875 for British currency and $5.875 for American currency, both the same as the previous day's closing prices, with the spot rates all level.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: the "boiled red" market price rose and then returned to level. The British, American, and other pound rates also rose and then turned level. British gold notes tended to be stagnant, with market prices standing at level. American dollar notes opened at $19.30. After the opening, Da Feng, Fenghe, Zhenhe, Changji, Liji, etc., sold, retreating to 0.09. Subsequently, due to competitive buying from sellers such as Xiang Tongxing, the price rose to $0.14. The midday closing was at $19.12, down by $0.03 compared to the previous day. Spot prices still needed to be reduced by about $0.25. The trend for Hong Kong dollars remained tight, rising to $4.75 in the evening market. Japanese gold notes rose sharply by $0.05, rising to $2.01 in the evening market. Korean notes also tended to rise, increasing to $1.60 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Universally Shorting at High Prices; Gold Market's Bullish Trend Dampened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "boiled red" gold market in the gray market first rose and then returned. After breaking through the 6,700-yuan mark three times, it immediately retreated each time. The sentiment among various parties changed from firm to tired, and the bullish camp gradually showed signs of wavering. Foreign exchange weakened from tight to level, as HSBC and Hong Kong Electric both supplied currency. There were also widespread rumors of Japan advancing south. Therefore, despite the bullish camp relying on the remaining momentum from the past three days to actively operate, it was already at the end of its strength. The Guangdong merchants shorted up to 7,000 taels, and the securities firm De Fu also shorted 3,000 taels. Western merchants continuously sold. At midday, the price retreated to 6,660 yuan, eventually closing up by a small amount. A total of 50-60,000 taels were traded in half a day. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Wednesday. Off-market prices had retreated to 6,645 yuan, requiring a markup of just over 20 yuan. Cash also marked down a small number of yuan, with Yida selling 50 taels to Tianyuan at a price 180 yuan higher than the forward contract, and then Zhongxing offered 10 taels at 270 yuan higher. Gold jewelry initially rose by 5 yuan, then returned to level, still at 715 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Briefly Exceeded the 700-Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,680 yuan at 9:15, marking an increase of 13 yuan. Gold shops and retail investors aggressively bought, surging to 6,705 yuan in an instant. Yi Yuan, De Da, Da Feng, and Yi Da aggressively sold, retreating sharply to 6,675 yuan. Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Hesheng aggressively bought, and Yida repurchased. With the August American dollar settling at only $5.15625, the price surged by 35 yuan to 6,710 yuan. Upon hearing that HSBC was supplying American currency, Da Feng, Litai, and Yi Yuan, from the Shanghai West merchants, sold again, hovering between 6,680 and 6,690 yuan for a long time. Near midday, Hengji and Defu vigorously dumped, falling more sharply. At midday, the price retreated to 6,660 yuan. Litai repurchased, and Xinfeng and Yong also bought. The midday closing was 6,669 yuan, up by 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the settlement price of $5.1875 for the American dollar last month, it was 6,713 yuan, marking a suppression of 44 yuan. After the closing, it was 6,664-5 yuan, with a difference of 50 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon. Off-market prices had fallen to 6,645 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 280 yuan higher than the "boiled red" forward contract price. Purchases were 80 yuan lower than sales. There were no prices or market for the current gold standard.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rose Sharply and then Returned</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry in silver shops was initially raised by 5 yuan by Da Tongxing and Xin Tongxing at 9:30 in the morning, reaching 720 yuan, then lowered by 5 yuan at 12:00, remaining at 715 yuan. Purchases were reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>

The association's quoted prices for spot goods: June delivery of No. 24 coarse white sugar was $96.50, May delivery was $95.80, April delivery was $95.20, March delivery was $94.80, and February delivery was $94.60, all up by 70-80 cents.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Emerges; Cotton Yarn's Rising Desire Halted; Highest Price Seen at $1,641</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then leveled off, but the trend remained strong. The situation in the domestic raw cotton market was still rising, so bullish investors were not bearish. Although the current selling price of yarn was firm, the enthusiasm of buyers was not as strong as before. However, today's exports to Hong Kong amounted to 1,840 bales, resulting in a group of bullish investors taking profits, and the market turned halfway. Some people said that recently the price of 42-count thread was already expensive, and 32-count single yarn was even more expensive, with the average selling price at around $2,200. In comparison, the price of 20-count yarn averaged around $1,600, which was considered relatively cheap. If the cotton market did not loosen, shorting seemed uneconomical. The high price for 20-count Double Horse brand was $1,641, and the low price was $1,628. However, in the afternoon, a sudden decline occurred. The opening price was $1,630. Following rumors of a southern advance, the market gradually declined to $1,609. According to market investigations, some "scalpers" dumped 1,000 bales, and another household dumped 500 bales, putting pressure on the market. The final price was $1,614-5, with securities firms being the main buyers.</p>
<p>Double Horse brand opened in the morning, continuing the firm and rising trend from the previous afternoon. The initial price was $1,635, but buying interest was very strong, rising to $1,641. Subsequently, upon hearing that the gold standard had opened higher and then returned to level, profit-takers dumped, easing to $1,629. However, with lower prices, there were still plenty of buyers, rising again to $1,635. The closing price was $1,630. According to statistics, 6,000 bales were traded in half a day, with 500 bales bought by Hong Kong merchants and 5,500 bales bought by domestic merchants.</p>
<p>Morning Market Conditions for Gold Double Horse Futures: The market opened in the morning, continuing the remaining momentum from the previous day. Foreign cotton futures continued to report rising prices. Short positions in near-term contracts were actively covered, with both July and August contracts rising by $4-$6.5. Upon hearing that spot yarn had risen and then eased, the September contract immediately fell by $4. Subsequently, there were more sellers than buyers, and market prices softened. The midday closing saw declines of $1-$7, with 11,240 bales traded. There were rumors of a Japanese southern advance and other bearish news in the afternoon market, causing bullish investors to sell and short positions to exert pressure, and market prices trended downward. As a result, all months fell by $15-$18 compared to the previous day. A total of 20,340 bales were traded throughout the day, an increase of 6,500 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the entire day are recorded on the left (net prices quoted).</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Brisk; Prices Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains firm. This is because the American and Indian cotton markets are consistently advancing, and purchase prices are increasing daily. Therefore, those holding goods are particularly firm and unwilling to act rashly. The yarn market declined slightly in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly level, but prices were still difficult to loosen. In reality, the source is not smooth, and inventory is gradually decreasing, so the trend is excellent.</p>
<h3>US Government Report: Initial Reduction in Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>Washington dispatch: The US government's first cotton field report for 1941 indicates that the cultivated area is 23,519,000 acres, a decrease of 1,352,000 acres compared to the first report last year. The original dispatch is recorded on the left (cotton field units in thousands of acres, cotton units in thousands of bales).</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Zhaopi (召皮) Firmly Rises</h3>
<p>Zhaopi has not arrived for a long time, and store inventories have long been exhausted. It is now reported that someone has managed to obtain a batch in Shantou. The goods are still good. At a time when values ​​are in great shortage, the product is very attractive. The offer price has suddenly risen by more than ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Bullish Investors Take Profits and Sell; Cotton Cloth Returns in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was firm and stable yesterday morning, turning tired in the afternoon. This was due to the continuous price increases in recent days, prompting bullish investors to take profits and sell. Actual sales were sluggish, causing market prices to fall again. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 25 cents per piece. Coarse cloth was stable. Some dyed cloth fell by 50 cents per piece. The street was watching and waiting. Transactions included over 200 pieces of current goods and grey cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased several hundred pieces of colored cloth and twill. Southeast Asian buyers purchased over 100 pieces of printed cloth and bleached cloth. Shandong buyers purchased 50-60 pieces of coarse cloth and woolen cloth. Furthermore, 1,225 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 10th).</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: The morning opening trend was firm and rising. In the afternoon, due to unfavorable news, various cloths suddenly turned downstream. Fine cloth from the leading factory opened at 50 yuan, reaching a high of 50 yuan and 3 jiao. The closing price in the afternoon was 49 yuan and 1 jiao, similar to the previous day. Called "Gentleman Serge" opened at 1 yuan 6 jiao 3 fen and a half in the morning, rising to 4 and a half fen, then falling back to 1 yuan 6 jiao 1 fen in the afternoon. The closing price recovered slightly by 7 li and a half, falling by 1 fen per yard compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Woolens Remarkably Strong</h3>
<p>Woolens and flannel: In previous years, the market atmosphere usually turned tired and sluggish at this time of year. Most of the summer goods for actual sales were gone, and the sales of autumn and winter goods were still pending. Business generally turned light. However, this year, due to the special domestic and international situation, the market for woolens is also unusual. Summer goods, more than half of which have been sold, not only show little fatigue but often turn from weak to strong. For example, Wanliding and White Serge even rose in unison. Due to the intercalary June, the outlets are mostly retail, but they are more prolonged and heavily sold than in previous years. Autumn and winter woolens have all been on the market for sale one or two weeks earlier. Selling prices are high due to the difficulty in sourcing and the possibility of stockouts. The public sees goods as rare treasures, and the market is remarkably strong. Yesterday, British-made Wanliding was priced at 40 yuan per yard for retail cuts, while locally made goods were priced from 27-28 yuan to 30 yuan. Medium-thick and ordinary White Serge is very scarce and popular. Navy Serge sells for 35-36 yuan per yard, with higher-grade goods even more scarce and trending upward.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Continue to Decline; Red Beans Firm and Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market continued to decline sharply. This was because actual sales were still sluggish, and many holders intended to release their holdings as the futures delivery date approached. Therefore, prices fell sharply again by 60-70 cents. The sale included 1,000 pieces of Kai Da soybean cakes and over 20,000 pieces of Shengji cake futures (price details in the market price column). Today, 4,200 pieces of soybean cake are being shipped to Hong Kong. Recently, the source of red beans has been very scarce. Because existing inventory is gradually drying up, the sentiment is remarkably firm. Yesterday, this street bought over 100 bags of Wuhu red beans at a price of 55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Billets Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>The black iron billet market, which has been booming for a long time, has recently become even more expensive. This is because overseas sources have disappeared, and local inventories are being sought after by various factories and users. The circulation of goods is increasingly insufficient, causing the standard market prices to continue to increase. Yesterday, the asking price for old steel factory goods was 4,200 yuan for 2,000 pounds, and Huilindeng goods were also sold for 1,000 yuan per bundle, which was 100-200 yuan higher than the previous market. Furthermore, inventories in the Shanghai market are not abundant, and demand is increasing. There is a possibility that spot goods in the Shanghai market may be exhausted.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Hemp Bag Prices Reach a Peak</h3>
<p>Hemp bags have recently been dull in disposal, and prices have reached a peak. Therefore, although inventories are thin, they will inevitably loosen. New and old bags are reduced by 20-30 cents each. Indian hemp rope is reduced by 50 cents per pound. Indian hemp cloth is reduced by 2 cents per pound. Domestic hemp cloth has not changed much. Green hemp is reduced by 5-6 yuan per piece. The detailed market prices of various grades are listed below.</p>
<h3>Coal: Huainan Fines Sell Well</h3>
<p>The coal fines market: Recently, after Kailuan fines were priced high, the general lower-grade goods took the opportunity to rise, very briskly. The handling fee was also raised, not without reason. Yesterday, Huainan bulk coal sold for 295 yuan per ton, and coal fines sold for 264 yuan, all from the warehouse to the customer's car, and an additional handling fee was required. It is said that more than 300 tons were sold in one day.</p>

<h3>Academic Lectures: Methods of Historical Research (4)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wujing</p>
<p>(2) Discovery of Antiquities. It is easy to discuss modern history, difficult to read medieval history, and even more difficult to read ancient history. Prehistoric history is even more vague and unknowable. Modern and medieval history, I will put aside for now. When it comes to ancient history, it is full of mysterious and strange events. For example, Wu Xu Zheng's San Wu Li Ji says that Pangu, who opened up the heavens and the earth, said:</p>
<p>"The heaven and the earth were chaotic like a chicken egg, and Pangu was born in it. After 18,000 years, the heaven and the earth were opened up. The clear Yang became the sky, and the turbid Yin became the earth. Pangu was in it, changing nine times a day, becoming divine in the sky and holy on the earth. The sky rose one zhang every day, the earth became one zhang thicker every day, and Pangu grew one zhang taller every day. After 18,000 years, the number of the sky reached its highest, the number of the earth reached its deepest, and Pangu reached its greatest length. Then there were the Three Sovereigns."</p>
<p>This myth is truly a bizarre spectacle. Other stories, such as the red dragon's influence on Nüwa, Shennong's dragon head, and the Big Dipper shining on the suburbs and influencing Fubao to give birth to the Yellow Emperor, are even more unclear whether they are gods, humans, or beasts. Therefore, a modern writer simply started with the Qin Dynasty, using a light touch on the history before Qin, almost dismissing it with a single stroke, which is perhaps too much. The Twenty-Five Histories do not mention a word about prehistoric history. However, in recent times, after the ancient artifacts unearthed from the ground were discovered, archaeologists emerged like clouds, compiling reports on their research. Although there is no complete and systematic ancient history for us to refer to, the subjective psychology of previous historians has been greatly changed. This is something we should emphasize and should be noted by scholars of history. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3>Shell Shock Syndrome</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>During the First World War, a young Australian soldier suddenly suffered from shell shock on the battlefield and became unable to speak. He was sent to a field hospital for treatment. The treatment went well, and his ability to speak gradually returned. At this time, the hospital was attacked by enemy aircraft several times, and the nurses had to move the patient to a safe location in haste and confusion. Unexpectedly, after this second fright, the young soldier developed a strange condition. He completely turned into a child, unable to speak. When given a pencil, he was at a loss and did not know what to do with it. He seemed to have forgotten the uses of various common objects around him, examining them with a curious and fearful attitude. He walked unsteadily, and if no one supported him, he would fall to the ground and crawl like a child. He could not feed himself. When the nurse fed him, she had to taste each bite first. He sometimes whimpered and cried, and he liked toys. Other than his adult size, his demeanor was no different from that of an infant. This rare phenomenon of "rejuvenation" is called regression in abnormal psychology.</p>
<p>A person needs considerable courage to charge into battle on the battlefield. This young Australian, fearing both the battlefield and being seen as a coward, unconsciously lost his ability to speak, achieving the goal of "not having to fight." Later, when he encountered an air raid, his condition worsened, and the regression phenomenon occurred. This was entirely an act of avoidance, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand.</p>
<p>Life is like a battlefield. To be a good soldier, one must summon courage and face reality. The result of avoiding difficulties is always tragic.</p>
<p>Physiology</p>
<h3>Six New Senses</h3>
<p>— Guo Dongcai</p>
<p>Perhaps you have always thought that your body has five physiological senses for receiving external stimuli. However, medical scientists now tell us that humans actually have eleven senses. In addition to the five "old" senses we are already familiar with: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, we should now add the following six "new" senses:</p>
<p>(1) Temperature Sense – You have about 30,000 warm sensation points and 250,000 cold sensation points on your body. If you place your palm on your cheek, you will definitely feel that your hand is cold. If you move your hand to your ear, you will feel that your ear is cold. This is because the hand has a normal temperature that is exactly between the cheek and the ear.</p>
<p>(2) Balance Sense – The three semicircular canals in your ear are the organs that manage this sense and also enable you to maintain stability when walking.</p>
<p>(3) Hunger Sense – Hunger is different from appetite. It is a real sense caused by the contraction of the stomach wall muscles.</p>
<p>(4) Muscle Sense – When you pick up an object from the ground, your muscles immediately judge the weight of the object through your brain. When you judge the distance to an object, the contraction or relaxation of the muscles that manage the focus distance of the eyeball tells you the distance of the object. When you want to make a sound, the muscle sense will tell you how to contract your throat muscles to make a loud enough shout without making it too soft for others to hear.</p>
<p>(5) Pain Sense – This is the most widely distributed sense on the body. Any excessive stimulation produces a feeling of pain. If you have any discomfort in your body, pain often indicates the location of the illness because pain is often an accessory to disease. Although the feeling of pain makes us sad, we cannot regard it as something to be cursed. It is actually a benefit to us because when any part of our body is damaged, it is a dangerous warning to us.</p>
<p>(6) Thirst Sense – The feeling of thirst is the most painful feeling if it cannot be satisfied. However, in addition to drinking water to quench our thirst, we can also inject liquid into the blood vessels to quench our thirst.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on "Blood Transfusion"</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>Blood transfusion—I have heard about it and seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>But what I have heard and seen is very different from what Mr. Feizi has heard and seen. A few years ago, when my uncle was lying unconscious on a hospital bed and the doctor thought it was necessary to give him a blood transfusion, we did not make much effort to invite three laborers.</p>
<p>Among these three laborers, one was a pale, fat man who had given blood one or two times. The other two were newcomers. During the blood typing, there was no "funny scene" performed. And the selected newcomer only frowned slightly during the blood transfusion. On the other hand, Mr. Feizi's "two coolie classes": one "slipped away quickly" and the other "asked to be exempted from the test", making people imagine their embarrassment at the time when they wanted to exchange money but could not (frightened to death). (It's not that they are not "generous," I think!) It's really "funny"!</p>
<p>But I have not been able to find that the above-mentioned laborer "regards blood transfusion as a very honorable thing" or that he has realized "the greatness of human mutual assistance"; he probably just sells his own blood as a commodity: he gave blood, got some not much money, and then quietly went his way.</p>
<p>After that, I read a confession of a person selling blood in a newspaper. It talked about the low price of blood and the increasing number of his competitors.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, a relative of mine had a blood transfusion because of illness. After he recovered, I went to visit him. He said to me: "A total of 300 CC was transfused, costing 75 yuan, which is cheaper than getting a booster shot." When he said this, his attitude seemed very relaxed. Or is it what is called "taking it easy"?</p>
<p>My observations are limited to this. It's really ordinary! Although it may show our "national conditions" to some extent—the truth of the present, even causing people to begin to doubt the saying that "science has no class nature."</p>
<p>In this society, there are mostly "acts of generosity at the expense of others." True human mutual assistance can only be expected in the future.</p>

<h3>German Paratroopers</h3>
<p>— Fang Shaozeng</p>
<p>In the eastern district of Balangbu City in West Prussia, Germany, there is an area completely designated for training paratroopers. They learn how to jump down from heights, how to crawl on rooftops like cats without being detected. They believe that landing on the roof is the most difficult to be detected. They believe that the most dangerous thing is descending in the air, but now they can use a special powder to create a smokescreen around themselves to avoid being discovered. In addition, they also carry special scissors to cut open steel plates, and ropes with hooks to help them jump down from lower houses or streets. The Mauser rifles they carry are made according to the latest designs, with bright forms, even in dark places, they can be freely used without difficulty. Every paratrooper is a well-trained sharpshooter.</p>

<p>10. A Father's Heart</p>
<p>Mei Bao stopped in a huff.</p>
<p>"Dad, do you think I don't have eyes?"</p>
<p>The more Mei Bao acted spoiled and playfully annoyed, the more Qiu Haitang loved her. Before she could say anything more, he suddenly picked her up with his empty left hand.</p>
<p>"Child, of course you don't have eyes!" he said, kissing Mei Bao's little face incessantly. "Didn't you see how big this umbrella is? If we walk shoulder to shoulder, it will cover you, but it won't cover me. If we don't want everyone to get wet, I have to carry you."</p>
<p>Mei Bao originally wanted to break free from his hand and jump to the ground, but hearing what he said, she could only let him carry her.</p>
<p>"You're right, good Dad!" She readily hooked her arms around her father's neck. "...Ah! Dad, your clothes are all soaked! You're suffering like this for me. From tomorrow on, I won't go to school anymore...! What if you get sick again...!"</p>
<p>The life of the father and daughter relying on each other for more than ten years meant that even if Mei Bao was a naturally cold-hearted child, she could not have no feelings for her father. Moreover, her personality was originally the kindest. When her fingers touched Qiu Haitang's soaked clothes, she couldn't help but cry out.</p>
<p>"It's just a little wet, child, what's the hurry?"</p>
<p>But Mei Bao was already sobbing.</p>
<p>"Hey! Silly child, what are you crying about? Look, we're almost at the market town, aren't you afraid of being laughed at?" Qiu Haitang said with a smile, kissing her cheek twice.</p>
<p>Mei Bao really couldn't stop crying.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang carried her for a long distance, and his arm really felt a little tired, so he stopped, carefully switched the umbrella to his left hand, and then switched his daughter to his right hand. (154)</p>

<h3>Talking About Actors Demonstrating Calligraphy and Painting in Public</h3>
<p>— Tianqi</p>
<p>Actors performing on stage should prioritize singing, reciting, acting, and martial arts skills. Secondly, the beauty of their appearance and the study of costumes are important. Since the emergence of modern dramas, stage scenery has also become an essential element. However, since Er Hui (Hui Sheng and Hui Bao) pioneered the insertion of calligraphy and painting into dramas, everyone has followed suit, creating a novel and special situation. In the past, many actors were skilled in brush and ink and could paint and write. Since the Republic of China, it seems that any actor who cannot paint and write cannot be ranked among famous actors. Therefore, male and female actors, in addition to studying drama with teachers, must also hire famous calligraphers and painters to teach them writing and painting, so as to show elegance and boast among their peers. Therefore, calligraphy and painting have become a secondary art that actors should have. Even those who cannot paint and write must hire someone who can write and paint to do it for them. Because actors' calligraphy and painting have become a trend, the success of actors depends on the beauty of their art, and the help of calligraphy and painting also occupies considerable strength. Later, those who imitated it included Kun Dan Xin Yanqiu, who painted orchids on the spot in the drama of Yu Jing Dao Ren. Wu Sheng Li Wanchun wrote "The Murderer is Wu Song" in Er Ben Wu Song, and Yang Baosen wrote inscriptions in the Pig Bajie drama, and Wu Suqiu left her name in Baiyu Building, which all added a lot of excitement to the entire drama. In short, actors' calligraphy and painting have recently become the most common practice, and the inclusion of calligraphy and painting in dramas was indeed pioneered by Er Hui.</p>
<h3>Zuo Jun Writes the Script for "Ah Q II"</h3>
<p>— Shibei</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" is undoubtedly a great literary work that has shaken not only our country but also the world. Therefore, Tian Han and Xu Xingzhi have adapted it into stage plays, and they have been performed many times, and the evaluations they have received are of course supreme.</p>
<p>Now, I have received news that Zuo Jun, who is editing new Chinese dramas in Guilin, has specially written "Ah Q II" after "The True Story of Ah Q." Of course, before reading the original work, we dare not judge its cultural value. However, we believe that the scripts produced in the inland areas where the anti-Japanese sentiment is high must be stimulating and powerful, in line with the times, and use Ah Q's life in the feudal social system to stimulate certain people.</p>
<h3>Directed by Fritz Fleck</h3>
<p>— Wu Ming</p>
<p>When it comes to Fleck, everyone should not be unfamiliar. He is the German director who recently completed "Children of the World" for Minhua. He has recently written a Chinese-style film script, which is a modern social script depicting Shanghai life. However, it has not been decided which company will produce it after it is written. As for "Children of the World", it is being edited and will be released after the autumn cools down.</p>
<p>Regarding Fleck's past directing experience, I can report to readers. He first studied fine arts and spent ten years of his life as an actor on the stage. From actor, he jumped to stage director, and then from stage director to film director. He directed his first film at a film company in Vienna, Austria, and also served as a set designer and photographer. Later, he successively traveled to Paris, London, Rome, Hungary and other places to shoot films. In Paris, he directed "Daughter of Madame Lhasa", and in Hungary, he directed "Floating Doctor". He directed a total of about two hundred films in Europe. Before coming to Shanghai, the last film he directed in Europe was "Father of Jippe", which was a great success in the United States and was considered one of the best American works. This time he came to Shanghai, and his impression of Chinese films is that Chinese film companies have complete equipment and a healthy awareness, but they are technically inferior, so he has this desire to improve the level of Chinese film technical talents.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: As Complete as Ning Wu Can Handle</p>
<p>Xu Jing said to Zhou Yuji beside him with great emotion: "General, you are the commander-in-chief, how can you take this risk? Let the subordinate go out, repel them, so that the city can be repaired completely, and the bandits cannot get up." Zhou Yuji had no other good way. Since Xu Jing was willing to fight for him, he had to allow it. So he allocated five hundred brave men and taught Xu Jing to lead them. Xu Jing himself rode a silver-maned horse, pulled on his battle armor, held a spear in his left hand, and held a sword in his right hand. He opened the city gate and rushed across the drawbridge. The bandits hadn't seen the government army fight for a long time, and they didn't expect this. Xu Jing, with the heart of dying, stabbed and chopped with his spear and sword, and only cared about rushing around in the bandit army. The bandits attacking the city were the ninth team and couldn't resist it, so they retreated one after another. Xu Jing wanted to give the guards on the pass time to repair the city walls, so he ran forward as much as possible. He didn't know where his courage came from today. The five hundred soldiers under his command also fought bravely. Li Zicheng heard that the government army was fighting and the ninth team was defeated, so he hurriedly ordered the tenth team and the first and second teams to come forward to meet them and work together. The bandit general Guan Youyong of the tenth team came forward to meet Xu Jing in a big battle. In less than twenty rounds, he was stabbed to death by Xu Jing with a spear. However, the first and second teams had already outflanked from the left and right, trapping Xu Jing's army. The third team continued to cover up. Zhou Yuji urged the soldiers to pick up earth and carry stones to repair the gaps in the city wall, and had no time to rescue Xu Jing. Bandit General One Tiger waved his broadsword and fought Xu Jing with all his strength. Xu Jing gritted his teeth and fought desperately. After a long battle, of the five hundred dead soldiers under his command, some died and some were injured, and there were only thirty left who could fight. Xu Jing didn't want to live today either, and used all his strength to fight One Tiger to the death. However, One Tiger had infinite strength, and Xu Jing's spearmanship gradually became disordered. One Tiger took the opportunity to sweep his arm with a knife. Xu Jing didn't have time to return the spear to defend himself. When he used his left hand sword to protect himself, his arm had already been cut by the knife edge, taking away a small piece of meat. Blood was dripping, and a burst of pain made him feel weaker in his hand, so he had to turn his horse and flee in panic. Because it was impossible for him to chase into the city, on the one hand, the retreat had been cut off, and on the other hand, he was afraid that the bandits would take the opportunity to rush into the city gate, so he would rather go elsewhere.

<h3>A Chat About "Wu Sheng" on Shanghai Stages (6)</h3>
<p>— Kui Jinchun</p>
<p>Zhang Delu</p>
<p>Zhang Ling's art is certainly not comparable to ordinary Wu Sheng, but recently, as he has aged, he has gradually deteriorated. When he was at the Gong Stage, he was already mediocre. Now that he is performing at the Grand Stage, the environment is better. According to his most prosperous period, he was at the Qiankun Grand Theater, where he once hung his head sign. Zhang is good at performing dramas such as "Luanzhou", "Jizhou City", and "Changbanpo". When performing, he can move the audience, and the loyalty and courage of the characters in the drama linger in their minds and do not disappear. But today, he does not often perform, only plays a supporting role. Even if he occasionally performs, he is not able to do it. It is not as good as the rising stars.</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou The famous one-legged Wang Shaolou, since Wang Huchen's death, has been a rare talent among Wu Sheng. The gentlemen who appreciate music praise him. His leg skills are so strong that he can stand upright and independent for several minutes, as hard as iron and without bending. His posture is excellent, and his attitude is free and easy. All of these are beyond the reach of other actors! Moreover, his appearance and demeanor are excellent. Whether it is a long-kao or short-da play, he performs seriously and hard. His singing is also worth listening to. The various martial arts roles in "Ji Gong Living Buddha" and "Strange Hero Ouyang De" are agile and clean in the use of knives and guns, and the styles are novel and different. He and Zhang Yipeng's various stunts complement each other. Gong Stage has always relied on him as one of the mainstays, which is really reasonable.</p>
<p>Liu Hanchen Liu Hanchen's stage name is indeed a true eight-year-old red, just like Zhou Xinfang is called Qilin Tong. It can be seen that Hanchen became famous on stage early. More than ten years ago, he was in his most popular era in Yantai, Jinan and other places. All long-kao dramas are possible, and short-da was more impressive in the past, but now it is much less so. In recent years, as he has aged, he has changed to singing literary and martial arts whiskers and is also good at acting, but most of them are still based on Wu Sheng. The year before last, Tianchan specially hired him to Shen for the role of Xu Mingxi in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" and returned to the north with fame. Now he belongs to Gong Stage, and the "Golden Money Leopard", "Xue Di Hate", and "Nanyang Pass" performed every Saturday and Sunday are extremely heavy, and the box office appeal is not weak.

<h3>The Object of Youthful Pursuit</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>When Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, was traveling in Mexico, the famous local artist Diego Rivera asked Paulette Goddard to allow him to paint her figure. Because Rivera was a world-renowned artist, she could not refuse out of politeness, and readily agreed, temporarily acting as a model. Rivera also requested that she wear a tennis outfit, and painted an oil portrait, titled: "The Object of American Youthful Pursuit". This title is rather unique. Originally, Paulette Goddard was known for her plump and sensual figure, and the beauty of her curves had long become the "object of American youthful pursuit," so this title is indeed very apt.</p>
