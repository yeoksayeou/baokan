<h3>美將宣布全面禁運　與澳會商合作援華</h3>
<p>美日恢復通知商希望成泡影　荷印香港加强禁出品效力</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十日華盛頓電　消息靈通人士稱、美政府不久即將宣布、對於各項原料品實施全面的禁運、羅斯福總統昨已將禁運貨物淸單範圍再加擴大、而將毛皮、混合纖維、瀝青、生瀝青、非鐵金屬、曁貴重金屬六類列入單內、此項限制辦法、大抵將自九月十日起實行、負責人士謂、美國統制出口貿易雖將及百分之八十、但不久仍當實行全面的統制、推原其故、欲使美國國防工業所需原料獲得充分供給、俾　美國能盡其對於中、英、蘇暨泛美各國所負之義務、此項限制辦法實施後、最受影響者、　為日本、反之、獲得優先權者、則為中、英、蘇三國曁泛美各國云、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日電　可靠消息、日期對荷印封存日本資產及實行經濟封鎖之反應雖形和緩、但荷蘭官方人士仍認為、日本之佔據越南、為對荷印安全之直接威脅、故凡足以增强日本戰事經濟之物品、皆禁止出口云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十一日華盛頓電　此間權威界人士昨信、澳洲與美國已進行外交之商討、係關於在華之合作、此項消息、係繼星期二夜駐華盛頓澳洲公使凱賽、國務副卿威爾　及總統行政參贊寇利會議之後、所披露凱賽與國務院官員拒絕透露會談之　目、惟某負責方面稱、因寇利之出則會　必係涉及中國之援助、非官方推測、此種援助將包括為緬滇公路或目前在建築中之平行鐵路所常用之鋼及士敏士及飛機之配件云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十日東京電　頃自消息靈通方面探悉、東京與華盛頓間進行談判、以期成立臨時辦法、緩和日、美現行緊張關係一項企圖、業已失敗、雙方會談不下十五次之多、但彼此均堅持本國立塲、不肯讓步、二日前美政府曾由　日期大使格魯、通知日政府、謂日本　不修改其態度、則現行談判、未見有成功之可能、因此兩國恢復通商之希望、亦必歸於泡影、而凍結資金以及太平洋貿易限制各項旣成事實、更將無限期延長、不復為暫時性質之辦法矣、此在東京負責方面、其神經亦復極度緊張、觀於美大使格魯與日期外相豐田及外次天羽間接觸頻繁、是證形勢迫切、加之盛傳雙方關於美僑撤退問題之談判、已吿擱淺、益使當地美僑為之不安、査美·日自互施凍結辦法後、雙方卽開始談判、企圖成立臨時辦法、不僅關於經濟事項、卽政治問題、亦擬覓求解決基礎、至少希望能保證美·日期間數個月之和平、聞美國在談判中態度堅決、雖可在經濟上若干綏靖辦法、但必須在政治上獲得某種條件、質言之、卽必須日本眞正的退却是也、據中立觀察家之見解、遠東時局業已完全改變、緣盎格魯撒格遜族二强、現已主動地位、並已放棄二年來之綏靖觀念、此在日本、則反而採取守勢、且其形勢日見孤立、日人所稱之「包圍政策」、今後已非宣傳機關之口頭禪、而為可怖之事實矣、又據接近政府者迭次表示、如果英·美仍繼續加緊包圍日本、則日本勢將被迫採取極端辦法、外問倘認此為純粹的宣傳、亦屬錯誤、良以據日本方面聲稱、根據過去數年之經騐、尤其是一九三五年對義實施制裁之經騐、寗可衝破封鎖而不願甘受窒息、同時、知日本民族氣質之中立國觀察家亦謂、日本與義大利相同、其忍耐性雖大、但一經決定之後、則有不顧一切之　、</p>
<h3>南北皆懸紅燈　日已自知被圍</h3>
<p>路透社二十一日華盛頓電　世人對於納粹主義與侵略行為之反抗旣臻一致、此間人士之注意乃復集中於遠東、而日本不許美僑離境之非常策略、尤幸美人對遠東之注意、衆覺在最近數星期中、尤其是在羅斯福邱吉爾會議後、世態已大改觀、中、英、蘇今皆在奮鬥中、荷印準備抗戰、而美國則始終為未交戰之協約國、美國對蘇之精神上援助、現漸轉為物質上援助、故日本在東方所處之地位、乃日臻惡劣、誠如紐約時報所言、南北皆懸紅燈、以防範日本、而日本所抱　可進行其步驟而免遭懲戒之希望、定已消滅於星期一日日外相豐田與美大使格魯長時間晤談中矣、紐約時報且謂、現有良好理由可信、美總統羅斯福與英產相邱吉爾、已決定應付日本新步驟之共同行逕云、以此間觀察言、日本今後步驟在加入世界戰爭、惟日本現慮於無往而不遭重大反抗之境地、且遇有非其所能安然應付之聯合軍力、日本旣不能稍獲其軸心同志國之絲毫援助、且亦漸知徒為他人作工具之地無益、或不敢輕躁行動亦未可知、有一事為此間觀察家所注意者、英·蘇·美有力陣綫既有發展、日期方報紙乃謂、英·美目前的在破壞日·蘇間之中立條約、並謂日·蘇兩國現正設法以强化其和平關係、然則日本新近之遣調大軍分駐滿蒙、此豈强化日·蘇和平關係之一種議案歟、日本今日確已被圍、但係為其自己未獲援助的努力所包圍耳、據此間人士之感想、雖東京主戰最力者、當亦知其一國之力決不能與中·蘇·荷印·英·美五國相敵矣、</p>
<h3>英稱對日期資金絕未考慮解凍</h3>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　倫敦負責方面昨稱、現未有英、日締結物物交換協定或日本資金解凍之問題、英倫銀行與橫濱正金銀行間所成立之銀行機構、不過準備在特殊事故中、特給貿易執照耳、每一執照、須在英國供給立塲上有其價値者、而供給之考慮、須與經濟戰之考慮相衝、如指此種機構為綏靖辦法、則屬錯誤、英倫銀行與橫濱正金銀行所議定之辦法、並不變更英外相艾登近在下院所宣布之狀況、今之辦法、規定可憑以發給執照之根據、但此根據極為狹仄也、在宣布凍結日本資金時、衆已知在若干有限之情形中、執照可以發給、惟此種辦法下了交易、必甚有限、其故有二、　由英運日之出口貨、如其價値超過英當局所認為適宜之日方進口貨、則不能運出、　英國不受任何貨物之束縛、日本所欲得之英貨、英國並不負必予供給之義務、</p>
<p>合衆社二十一日倫敦電　此間權威界昨稱、在目前商討中之辦法之下、被凍結資金中「日本所得者不過數千英鎊而已」、據悉、承平時期英、日貿易之經常周轉約七百萬鎊、官員宣稱、目前之辦法純係資助英、日兩國使領館、殊無擴大此種便利之意、官員宣稱、資金凍結以後、英國並無對日本發給出口照會、權威界堅稱、「英國對於日本在遠東任何一步之行動、均採取極端嚴峻之態度、英國已在馬來亞及其他各處作充分之防衛措置」、權威界稱、英國並未予泰國以武力後援之特別保證、惟英方之情緒如何則無可疑之處、</p>
<p>香港二十一日電　港府頃下令擴大出口貨　運地域、除德及其佔領區外、並列入日本及其屬地、委任統治地、滿洲、港府此係為加强對日之效力而頒發者、</p>
<h3>日本藏相陳述目前金融危狀</h3>
<p>公共汽車九月起禁駛　米及麵包亦計口分發</p>
<p>路透社二十一日東京電　此間各報多詳載藏相在東京銀行俱樂部之演詞、金融之危狀及國內應付方法、至於泰國與其他國際問題、皆未有進展、故不佔重要報吿地位、</p>
<p>路透社二十一日東京電　日政府已決定從九月一日起禁止用汽油之街車與公共汽車及私人汽車行駛、以便保全汽油供給、惟私人汽車用於特殊事故者、得免禁止、公共汽車之不以汽油為燃料者、可照常營業、惟汽車站將予廢止、</p>
<p>路透社二十一日孟買電　昨乘日輪從日本抵此之某印人稱、日本每月有六日不售面包、而牛油與乳酪亦供給甚少、且價格頗昂、米與麵包業已計口分發云、搭該日輪來此之印人旅客共四十人、</p>
<h3>傳英在叙里亞　宣布戒嚴</h3>
<p>合衆社二十一日維希電　巴黎報紙昨載一安哥拉雷訊、謂英已宣布叙里亞全境戒嚴、英國此項戒嚴、定係於英軍與阿　伯士著、在阿　波衝突後宣布者、</p>
<h3>法外交人員　投効自由法國</h3>
<p>合衆社二十一日科斯達里加聖喬　電、此間法國參贊及法使館秘書、昨日向維希提出辭職、並接受自由法國運動領袖特戈爾將軍所委之同樣職務、</p>
<h3>傳英美商定　六項程序</h3>
<p>國際社二十一日華盛頓電　據可吿方面今日透露、英美已商定對德六點程序、（一）盡量以物質援蘇、鼓勵蘇聯繼續抗德、（二）繼續援華、加緊包圍日本、（三）大增英國地中海區兵力、以阻德軍在該區發動攻勢、（四）僅速增加美國對英援助、並擴大英空軍力量、（五）必要不時先德軍而佔領伊郎·達加·阿索斯帬島·威　角·甚至土國、（六）今·明兩年英對德以取守勢為主、至一九四三年、即發動對歐攻勢、上述六點計劃、代表羅斯福·邱吉爾會議之結果、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>時間的因素</h3>
<p>最近羅斯福總統自海上歸來延見新聞記者，曾經指出此决戰爭將爲一長期艱苦的戰爭，警告人民勿以目前成就驟抱樂觀，並又表示戰事有延續到一九四三年底的可能，美國現正考慮中英蘇三國明後兩年中的需要與美方如何供應問題。與此同時在義大利法西斯內部，近亦關於歐戰期限問題有所爭執，十九日法西斯政制報發表社論，嚴厲抨擊義政界一部人士所稱歐戰勢將延長十年的見解，表示如果經過十年大戰之後，無論戰勝國與戰敗國均將杳無人烟。可見時間因素正是現行戰爭中一個重要因素，無論民治國或軸心國。都正加以重大注意。</p>
<p>戰爭而延長到十年，並不一定是罕見的事，、在歐洲史上就曾有過著名的三十年戰爭和百年戰爭，三數年來，留心遠東時事的人大概也不時聽到類此的炎炎大言。但是敢爲大言者，自身未必眞具有與之相符的實力，而所謂三十年百年戰爭者也大都指着若干不相連續戰事的總和，並且還是火器尚未普遍應用時代的事。以現代戰事消耗的重大，破壞的可驚，自然不能與中世紀的戰事觀念相提並論，在這一點上也許上述法西斯的看法是對的。但這樣的觀察却只觸到了問題的皮毛。</p>
<p>一般說來，侵略國家利在速戰速決，反抗侵略方面則側重持久作戰，這一戰略上的分歧是彼此主觀條件不同有以使然，也是自從戰爭開始之際就已決定了的。侵略者所行爲藉口的「有」「無」理論，本毫無意義可言，但以言從事戰爭、今日的侵略者實際都不是具有廣土衆民與豐富資源的國家。爲了取得作戰物資，侵略者之依賴世界市塲實較民治國家之握有世界海權且領土與國遍全球者迫切萬分。但在對方封鎖禁運之下，其所得取而應用者却只有其本土與佔領地帶的出產與戰前物資的屯積；以有限的來源，供無窮的消耗，其無法從事長期作戰自不待言。更何况在經濟問題而外，侵略國家政權的安定大都建立在高壓統治與對外建立功業兩個基礎之上，擴展而不能迅遂所欲，則必然要引起內部潛伏危機的表面化。犧牲牛油以製大砲，單從備戰立塲來看固屬無可厚非，但同時也就伏下了一個危險的因素；質言之，犧牲的終極目的是爲了取得更多的牛油，假如結果反而只是招致長期的苦難和犧牲，則人民的忍耐痛苦亦自有其最大的限度，更何况在侵略者根本並沒有必須訴之一戰的理由。是以政制報的見解在實質上到無髯是一種苦悶的發抒，那也就是一切與義大利處境相類似國家的共同苦悶。</p>
<p>不過在納米德國，最近情勢看來，縱然已經不是去夏西綫大勝之後的飛揚跋扈，其攻勢實力還未達到再衰三竭的階段，在最近的蘇德戰爭中，表現着日爾曼民族的堅強毅力迄今不斷進展之中，却依然是個鉅艱任務。同時也就是縱然納粹也亟望速戰速決，但在目前，上述種種因素尙未使其作戰機構遭受嚴重蝕損，這大概就是羅斯福總統要以長期戰爭警告美人的原因。根據三數年來的經騐。無論在東方或西方，時間因素都發揮了重大的作用，目前現狀固未必全滿人意，但却不能否認這一悠久過程之中的重大進展。最近國際形勢急轉直下，已有接近最後清算的徵象，不過對於　時間的利用仍舊不容輕忽，另一方面也就是幸勿過分執著於速勝一念，而忽略了如何讓侵略者繼續遭受時間因素的打擊。對侵略者的反攻是世人所急切盼望的事，而反攻條件的成熟則猶有待於對方更大的消耗與已方實力的繼續增強。今日世界三大戰事，在遠東已成相持之局，在西歐尙未出於主力的交綏，在東歐則雙方正以全力從事於空間與時間的爭取；至於各個侵略國家，容或戰鬥力尙較形優勝，而土地人民資源三個條件較之反侵略陣綫都望塵莫及，其進行和平攻勢，企圖冒險求逞，都是焦急不耐的一種表現，同時也是在時間重壓下所暴露的窘態。目前的中心問題並不是局部勝負和進退，而是如何針對各方客觀情勢使侵略者在適當時機受到致命的一擊。</p>
<p>不管戰事是否眞要延續到一九四三年底，反侵略國家却必須具有長期苦戰的決心。這是羅斯福所發表談話的微意所在。戰爭的牲和破壞是難免的，但長期戰爭的結局斷不是交戰國雙方都成為杳無人烟；而必然是侵略者的毀滅與侵略罪惡的絕跡。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十一日伊朗國邊境某地電　伊朗國局勢緊張、已達最高峯、政府當局、已在軍事上　取各項預防措置、同時英蘇兩國在外交上所行使之壓力、亦復有增無减、苟欲完全瞭伊朗國局勢、唯有先就其政治軍事形勢加以觀察　伊朗陸軍係於九二八年起　始現代化、聘請外國　事顧問、加以新的配備及嚴格訓練、全國陸軍祇有九帥　、其中若十師且已機械化、另有騎兵五旅、砲兵一團、空軍則有飛機二百架、大半爲舊式飛機、此項軍隊、全部効忠國王、因此、外人茍企圖侵入伊朗國境內、勢必遭遇堅決抵抗、但以限於實力之故、其勢恐難持久、至以政治而論、波期灣內之巴林島、乃英國海軍根據地、在　事上、頗爲重要、伊朗政府曾向英國要求返還該島、此舉果能成爲事實、共對於國　之威信、必能大有裨　、職是之故、目下問題、端視英國是否認爲假道伊朗國述輸遠征軍前往蘇聯一事、甚爲重要、而願將巴林島返還伊朗國是也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十一日紐約電　報載倫敦電稱、關於英國與蘇聯分別要求伊朗政府驅逐數千德僑出境事、伊朗政府所提復文、未能滿意、</p>
<p>海通社二十一日土京電　土報紙所載德國駐伊朗公使、已向伊政府提出最後通牒、如伊朗屈服於英國外交壓力下、而將德僑驅逐出境、則德國立即與伊朗斷絕外交關係之消息、已由伊朗駐土公使那以否認、</p>
<h3>英外相艾登　對土廣播</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社廿日倫敦電　外相艾登、今日向土耳其人民發表　播演說、略謂、五閱月　、余訪貴國、得與貴國總統伊諾努作懇切坦白之談話、向是厥後、國際上曾發生種種嚴更變化、但有　事確定不變者、即貴國對於保衛獨立、抵抗侵略，具有不可動搖之決心是也、貴國幸有此項決心與勇氣、庶能在中東獲得重要地位、過去如此、現在亦然、若能一秉此旨、則將來何莫不然、敬祝友邦國運昌隆云、</p>
<h3>傳德法將討論　和平條件</h3>
<p>路透社廿一日倫敦電　獨立法人通信社傳維希官塲消息、據謂、維希與德國刻正討論和的條件、維希將依此和約、允許德國利用法國與法屬非洲之海陸軍根據地、德方希望在可能短時期中與維希締結一約、或至少初步和約、德方爲報答借用根據地起見、將撤退駐法軍隊之牛數、餘者雖留法境、然視爲友邦、如駐兵義境之辦法然、而非視同佔領區、戰後英國在非洲領土、如奈基尼亞與黃金海岸等、可割歸法國、而由德法共同開拓、維希將以法國亞爾薩斯與芬蘭兩省讓與德國、但法國可得比國北部若干處、法國無須以土地割與義國、仍可保留都尼斯、而義國則取埃及以作放棄都尼斯之報酬、此項談判、刻在進行中、</p>

<h3>法幣增值匯率回長　物價仍抬高未降</h3>
<p>商人貪婪成性無從約束</p>
<p>市民切盼當局實施控制</p>
<p>據本埠負責人士聲稱、外匯近吿低落時、此間許多華人店主與居奇貿利之徒、貪婪成性、猛將各種物價抬高、簡直無從的束、工部局物價調查處某員亦承認日來法幣價値雖漲、各種物價並未隨之稍减、</p>
<p>物價調查結束已久</p>
<p>記者以日來華字報紙對各種物品允其是煤球之漲價、責難工部局事相叩、該員答稱、發此責難者、對於促使生活費用騰貴之工資增高等因素、未加考慮、物價調查處現僅從事於編繕基本物價之每週比較表、而調查一般物價之工作、已結束有時、局方不復調查物品之批發價或物價之每日漲落云、</p>
<p>比較數字探詢而得</p>
<p>記者問局方如何決定每週物價比較表中之數字、該員解釋云、一般物價、均以市價爲準、若市上不能購得之物、則向公共租界一般商店中探詢其價格、所謂一般商店、乃指中等規模之商店而言、並非大商號或小肆、但各商店所報售價、恒有各別者云、</p>
<p>華人方面頗表扼腕</p>
<p>此間華方人士對於工部局在此「緊急時間、」停止調查一般物價、頗表扼腕、因局方調查物價、可使商人得有其售價受當局檢查之印象也、此亦生活費用高漲原因之一、</p>
<p>匯率回長物價未跌</p>
<p>法幣滙率縮短時、任何物價、莫不抬高、今匯率已回長、而與低落前同、然物價並未稍跌、其藉口無非爲不能照舊價添貨、記者又以此間實施物價統制事叩諸工部局物價調查處某員、據稱、渠意局方實行此舉、須耗巨大支出僱用許多人員、以蒐集必要之實況與數字、始能奏效、物價之奇昂、牽涉航運與滙兌等多種因素、非局方一時所能控制、</p>
<p>洋米加價實屬不智</p>
<p>外傳許多華人商店出售麵包、重量短少之說、與局方查悉者不符、麵包乃重要食物、局方對之、頗爲注意云、此間華方人士對工部局所辦洋米之漲價、亦多責難、謂該局此舉、實屬不智、巳證明共刺激店主等抬高售價、</p>
<h3>明日起　荳腐漲價</h3>
<p>前日荳腐公所集議、定本月廿三日起、再度漲價、另售起碼爲一角、此其加重於平民生活負担、殊非細微也、該業擬定之新價目單開列每板改售五元、另售嫩荳腐起碼一角、（現祇售五分）、老荳腐起碼二角（現祇售一角）、荳腐製品、照新價所列、漲起亦鉅、計荳腐衣每張四角、香荳腐乾每塊一角、其漲起均在一倍左右、往常漲價之前一日、該業例須停業一天、以示決心、今年因該業公所恐肇事端、巳行勸阻、</p>
<h3>公倉暹羅米　明日發售</h3>
<p>四十六家經售　價一百十六元</p>
<p>上海食米公倉管理委員會自成立以來、於七月初即辦到仰光米一批、按照工部局平價米辦法讓售於工部局、以每石一百十六元之價格、交由各米號門市發售、嗣又議決在泰國緬甸等處分別採辦一批、俾决第運滬調節本市民食、現巳有暹羅二號米一批、總計四百噸裝運來滬、該會以該項暹羅二號米與工部局平價米之仰光米質地不同、且爲數只有四百噸、自不能按照上次辦法讓售於工部局、爰經議決委託上海市米號業同業公會所屬同業四十六家於門市平價發售、共計三千七百三十四包、此外該會所辦尙有仰光米五萬八千三百五十包、於九月底亦可來滬、</p>
<h3>軸心國遠東僑民　分程撤退來滬</h3>
<p>德義日僑民四百八十人　今日自馬尼剌乘輪抵埠</p>
<p>法國郵船公司霞飛將軍號郵船、由西貢經小呂宋來滬、原定本月十六日到埠、後改十九日可到、因天氣惡劣、海面有霧、行駛遲緩、又須遲至昨日到滬等情、已誌昨報、茲悉該郵船咋日尙未抵埠、據公司方面消息、今晨大致可到埠、在滬不多躭擱、即將返越、</p>
<p>三國僑民由菲撤滬</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、從馬尼刺撤退之德義日僑民的四百八十人、搭法國郵船公司霞飛號啓程、料將於明（二十二日）晨八時抵此、霞飛號係從西貢與馬尼刺來滬、法國郵船公司人員對此事保守緘默、惟據探悉、霞飛號所戰德義僑民、泰半將在上海登岸、日僑的三百七十五人、則將過滬赴日、</p>
<p>霞飛號輪曾受搜查</p>
<p>霞飛號又載貢米約五千袋來埠、將繫泊公和祥碼頭、乘客皆在海關碼頭登岸、按報載霞飛號泊馬尼刺時、美駐菲專員公署曾派員登該輪搜查搭客行李中被凍結之證券、</p>
<p>日新田丸今後行動</p>
<p>又此間日本郵船會　人員頃稱、關於現泊日本之新田丸行東、未接消息、故不知該輪將吾復駛上海云、按新田丸曾於數週前過滬、載去大批日僑、因政局匯係、該輪已停駛美國、</p>
<p>美撤僑輪準備駛日</p>
<p>據航業界消息、現有美總統輪公司之郵船一艘、即將於本月底左右扺滬、據悉美國當局、對撤退旅美日僑事、現正向日方提出嚴重交涉中、一俟該輪抵滬後、如交涉獲有結果、即將兼灣日本、以備撤退其旅日美僑之用、並悉本埠總統輪公司方面、將對該輪之頭等艙凡由滬至港者、拒絕發售客票、即爲預備供旅日美僑之用、至該輪扺滬之確實日期、則公司方面爲保持安全計、不願宣洩、</p>
<p>旅日英僑遇機撤退</p>
<p>字林報駐日特派員懷埃丁廿日東京電云、此間英大使館某員今夜吿記者稱、英當局目前並未採取徹退旅日剩餘英僑之預定行動、亦未與日當局計劃此事云、但現有許多英僑、欲遇有機會、即離日本、雖日本口岸中現無英船、而短期內亦不致有何英船駛抵日本、然英僑可搭日船赴上海、轉往其他各地、顯不受任何阻碍、惟近頒資金凍結令之結果、當然將感不便、且日方對旅日外僑離境、現巳實施更嚴峻之條例、</p>
<p>東北外僑開始撤離</p>
<p>旅居東北各地英美僑民、自英美政府凍結資金令後、備受日方監視留難、哈爾濱之英美僑民百人、業巳啟程撤離、可於今日搭車抵達塘沽、除少數轉搭火車至平津外、其餘均將候輪來滬、該批英美僑民、包括商民·敎士及婦孺眷屬、預計行程、可於本月杪抵達本埠、</p>
<h3>美新任商務參贊談　今後滬美貿易</h3>
<p>不致為凍結令所束縛　合法貿易可照常經營</p>
<p>英文金融商業報云、上星期抵滬之新任美商務參贊葛羅夫斯、係繼任安諾德遺缺者葛氏前來上海、尙屬初次、本報特派代表前往造謁、蒙葛氏予以接見、據葛氏稱、「美國對上海之貿易、大槪不致受長時期之影響、美國輸入之數量、亦不致因七月二十六日華盛頓所發表關於貿易與匯兌之章程，而有所减少、」葛氏繼論及最近之</p>
<p>凍結令據稱、　之意見、認爲美當局應有若干規定、使美國對上海與中國以及其他外國之貿易、在合理之範圍內、得以繼續進行、渠稱、美國對外貿易之統制、務須注意、美國對上海之輸出、必須爲正常之用途、渠認爲在嚴格統制之下、美國之接濟品、或可不致被人所濫用外匯之便利、須由美商銀行經手、以便繼續合法之輸入、渠繼稱、「就華盛頓之當局而言、對上海及其他遠東口岸輸出之會、必須向</p>
<p>營業照輸出統制管理人取得之、該管理人爲馬克斯惠兩將軍、管理處雖巳發給輸出照會、而財部拒絕供給金融之便利、當然亦爲可能發生之事、但就一般而論、太平洋之局勢、如無重大之變更、則美國與上海間之貿易、自不致受到嚴重之影響也、」但葛氏此項意見、當然僅就令融方面而論、至於</p>
<p>運輸船隻之缺乏、並不包括在內、故葛氏承認若運輸問題、繼續發生變化、則今後數月內、美國對上海之輸出、其數量究竟多少若何、殊難預言、葛氏論及一般貿易之原則時稱、自一九一八年第一次世界大戰以後、正常貿易關係、早已不復存在、每一國家、均樹立其貿易壁壘、以保護本國之經濟而抵抗其鄰國之經濟、以致國際貿易、大受影響、渠稱、「當和平重來之後、余深信貿易不致再有此種桎梏、貨物得有比較自由之行動、而繁榮亦隨和平以俱來」</p>

<h3>公和祥碼頭　工人探捕衝突</h3>
<p>罷工肇事工人四傷一死　在塲西捕兩名亦受輕傷</p>
<p>怡和洋行經理虹口東百老匯路公和祥碼頭臨時小工二百餘人、於上週初因生活日高、度日艱難、推派代表向資方提出要求、增加工資與津貼、未獲邀准、工人等遂於　日</p>
<p>實行罷工、昨日下午三時許、資方再派代表與工方代表談判、資方於事前電話致捕房、要求派捕維待秩序、但全體臨時小工、頗表不滿、談判結果、又未能滿意、致全體工人與資方</p>
<p>發生衝突、工人中竟有袖出鐵棍及磚塊、向資方代表亂擲、一時情形頗爲嚴重、期時在塲之探捕、極力彈壓、以維秩序、並無效果、探捕等乃開槍數響、致有小工五人、中彈受傷、其中一人、彈中嬰害、當塲</p>
<p>氣絕斃命、又有西捕兩人、亦受傷、一名開弟、一名克拉勃、事後捕房又派大批探捕前往調查、一面將受傷工人四名、送入滬東療養院醫治、巳斃命之工人屍體、送入騐屍所候騐、兩西捕則送巡捕醫院療治、</p>
<h3>太平洋颶風　又將襲滬</h3>
<p>如風向不變滬將受侵</p>

<h3>金融　申請結欵所得無幾　進口商重向黑市追求</h3>
<p>美匯昨又緊至四元六二五</p>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌均未更、小櫃檯美滙仍五元三一二五、暗市美滙等於無價、美滙重趨緊俏、華商投機多頭稍有出籠、而英日商行頗有進胃、上午價由四元八七五緊至四元七五、下午英美烟公司及棉花商結款浩繁、更聞英美商行會議、鑒於申請結款所得無幾、有繼續維持黑滙消息、美商等行一再扳貴價供給、故在混亂中、英金已打破本月十一日之二辦士八四三七五歷來緊價、至二辦十八一二五、美金亦縮人該日之四元七五內、見四元六二五新緊價終兩滙均　緊頗巨、交易轉　、</p>

<h3>現金一漲三百元</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、旋跌即步見回漲、六千八百元大關敲破後、重見回出、雖滙豐小櫃檯美滙仍五元三一二五、但週一之正當商業結款、聞仍未領到、進口商又向黑市猛扒、致外滙劇緊、各方虛疲之人心、不免影響轉堅、補空者較出籠允爲急切、香港幫滬西幫爭前拖進、致　日價由晨開六千七百五十元步見盤上、下午至六千八百七十五元、終反跌而軋升廿八元、全日交易十五萬兩、掉期（八月轉入九月）買方貼出予賣方由九十元、做高至一百廿元、現金漲風變本加厲、空前高峯層出不窮、上午首由同康永售予祥興永一百三十兩、價爲九千一百元、時和·順源各出德成二十兩、爲九千二百十元、順源又出銀樓幫五十兩、爲九千二百五十元、再出天元六十兩、九千二百六十元、祥興永出德大十兩、九千三百元、順源出成記十兩、九千二百二十元、下午順源出祥和五十兩、九十二百五十元、天元出公和·大成永·鑫源·德成一百四十兩、爲九千二百六十元、益大·同康永各出十兩予合盛爲九千三百元、此上日價猛漲三百兀凶之巨、首飾金亦步升二十元、爲九百九十元新高價、</p>
<p>期貨暫做了結交易</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）經前日午後會議後、會方勸導暫做了結交易、鑒於匯豐小櫃檯美滙五元三一二五、恐從此不更、市勢未免轉軟、有供少求、致九點　五分開市爲六千七百五十元、比上日收價低八十二元、空方趁低補進、天元·熾大爭買、金號·成記更加碼爭進、當間提升四十元、爲六千七百九十元、益大·愼記出籠、當見回退至六千七百七十元、後因黑市美滙趨緊、出籠之風轉弱、義元收吸、升至六千七百八十元、午收六千七百七十六元、收後六千七百八十元、下午人心頗佳、二點開市即升至六千八百元關口、後稍遜至六千七百八十五元、黑市外滙之猛緊、合盛·成記·德成·益大等爭先牧吸、當見步升九十元、哄達六千八百七十五元、爲祥興、永及散戶吐售、回下至六千八百四十五元、大豐·益大力進、三點半收市、六千八百六十元、比前日午收價、軋升廿八元、照黑市九月美金四元六二五結價、爲七千五百廿九元、計撳　百六十九元、若照滙豐小櫃　美滙五元三一二五計算爲六千五百五十五元、則抬三百〇五元、當日有一百廿五元差度、收後六千八百七十元、現金號之本牌金、鬥市售價須九千三百元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金掛九百五十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行、於上午十點半升十元、十一點半又升十元、計九百五十元、（收進減四十元）、共升二十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣一致升騰</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、現金市價繼續飛漲、英美金鎊因亦續漲十元、英金票需要殷切、市價猛漲三元、美金票開盤一千九百卅元、開後盈泰·東升恒·振和·協豐·等購買、抬至五十二元、午收五十元、午後開盤五十五元、協泰·惠豐·祥源永·志成·利記等購買、抬至八十二元、永和·振和·協豐等售出、退爲一千九百七十四元收盤、比上日軋升十元、成交數的八十萬元、現貨繼續飛漲至二十二元七角、香港票趨勢平穩、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票漲勢頻厲、前者高至二元五角二分、後者升爲一元九角一分、此外如新加坡安南羅比坎拿大票等均趨漲勢云</p>
<h3>油市　油儈毫不放鬆　狂抬油價</h3>
<p>昨日食油投機買風突又轉盛、一般米蠹與油儈會合一氣、大肆縱橫、致菜油及棉子油價竟被拉抬、節節上騰、在升達十元之巨、生豆油暗盤亦俱見俏、統市售開大有廠淸油一千餘担價爲一百九十九元至二百〇四元、又菜油七百担、價二百〇八元至二百十元、日華廠菜油一千五百桶、價二百元至二百〇八元半、吉田廠菜油一百五十桶、價一百九十八元至一百元、立德廠菜油一百桶、價九十二元至一百〇一元半、泰山廠菜油百桶、價一百九十四元至一百元、</p>
<p>又有豆子五百六十包、今日運香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　小絞跌至公賣價下</h3>
<p>只須外匯有供給更無問題</p>
<p>昨日洋米、初跌後定、市價又見盤落二三元、蓋洋米存底充足、途貨絡繹抵埠、市面早呈下遊、近以外匯供給有恃、船隻多裕、水脚降低、成本又可减低、且產地電報該地市價均見報落、故目下定貨只須外匯結到、即可大量訂定、因此人心更虛、早市有合義兜售外、再有愼記拋售甘五日祗埠小紋八九百噸、價祇一百四十八九元、現貨大市原包小絞即小至一百四十六元、二十　米一百三十九元半、亦乏大戶吸收、現米同時趨落、小紋米市石小至一百二十元、已低於平賣價格、其他各米無不一致下遊、但價小後、又被浮整各囤趁小吸收、且傳外匯申請不易、故午市略見回振、全日交易計一萬包云、</p>
<p>昨載太古公司甘州輪、由滬裝載洋米七千包運津一節、茲悉該輪改今日出口、洋米祗五千包、係運往靑島、並非運天津、惟原船尙有香港裝往靑烟津之洋米甚夥、該輪全係洋米、並無什貨、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、因前兩朝大雨傾盆、途成澤國、多數來源受阻、到貨頓見寥落、而市存在連日甩脫之下、亦已將罄、於是貨主對於手中所餘者、猶着奇貨、均不肯貿然脫售、一遇問津、喊聲迭起、而一般作客急於應需、祇得仰其鼻息、所以厚薄兩粳行情、頓吿回昂二三元不等、開南港早稻一百五十三四元、次至一百五十元、無錫原包特粳一百五十五元、大市一百五十元、宿次貨一百四十五六元、浦東新粳當此環境、遂亦一致提升、開一百五十八九元、</p>
<p>糯米際茲時屆秋凉一般搬運者應於節令、所向產地訂就之貨、日來絡續抵埠、業已上市、市貨轉旺、同時銷塲方面、亦已不若曩昔之淸淡無奇、如飯担等零星均較活絡、且有飯作舖酒戶等躉數交易、故大局市况、猶呈佻求相仿、售價未有榮辱、計續開香港白元高自一百三十元决至一百二十五元、糯米高自一百十七元次至一百十四元、國糯一百三十三四元、</p>
<h3>粉市步軟</h3>
<p>新囤觀望…舊多求脫</p>
<p>麵粉　昨日現洋粉市况、步趨軟化、查本街實銷、因廠務佻量不足、日常需用、尙稱不惡、轉口霄去化、亦時有吸收、故市面脚地並未過鬆、惟洋粉進口、旣有外滙供給、且有定貨新成交之說、在定到不絕中、人心不免虛怯、新囤觀望、舊多求脫、致市價步鬆、計開金龍粉浦西棧三十三元一角半至三十三元、砲台粉三十四元四角半至三十四元零五分、及香蕉粉三十三元七角、五燕粉三十三元九角、比前悉降二三角不等、成交不足二萬包、</p>
<p>小麥　交易仍感寂寞、因附近到貨頗爲零星、除日廠略有收進外、華廠收買殊爲不易、各廠進價、暫無變動、市塲買賣依然停頓、</p>
<h3>紗花　又說藏棉不如囤紗　論活動仍要推期紗</h3>
<p>紗市趨勢、復入　旋之途、但人心對於雙馬廠單、大都看疲、因之近日成交又見减色、市態更乏强大伸縮力、至於現紗交易、雖不及當日之繁盛、惟市價仍不大怠懈、三二支及四二支依然堅挺如恒、廿支雜牌紗之情况亦帶昂勢、惟獨廠單爲平庸也、不過有一部份吸進不棄、因爲原料高昂、廠方成本巳增加、市上之議論、有藏棉不如囤紗矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百八十三元、低價爲一千六百五十八元、收槃價爲一千六百七十二元、午後停市、耳聞取引所紗布價格一致昂騰、人心頗佳、不知又有什「牛司」、有云標金又復七漲之故也、加之連日運港之紗不絕、今日又有棉紗一千六百卅件運交香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、氣勢帶軟、因大都看有回風、所以買者乏勁、且成交不及昔日之旺、首盤價爲一千六百六十元、少頃跌至一千六百五十八元、繼後盈利者扒補、及新買者稍起、同時取引所二盤又回昂、於是情况隨之而挺、陸續升至一千六百八十三元、然檯面上之人心預測、暫時不易出七百元關外、價格稍好、復來放空、同時實際交易不暢、又鬆至一千六百七十二元收盤、比上日跌落三元、然塲中賣買不湧、查半日間成交統計六千一百五十八包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港一五〇　內地八</p>
<p>同行六、〇〇〇　統計六、二八</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况趨勢堅俏、重又冉冉上升、當晨初開盤、先以美棉高漲有加、而廠單反見下游、乃期紗則因隔昨低落較鉅、突引起多方之興趣、且以金市專做了結、乃增强不少買戶之潛力、九月期開出爲一五七五元、即軋好四元半、雖一度降一五六八元、俄即回上、入後十月期爲一五九〇元、漲上七元五角、十一月期開出爲一六〇六元、入後檯面緊縮、雖交易未旺、於多方之拉提下、扶搖直上、故午收九月期一五八〇元、十月期一五九三元五角、十一月期一六一四元、近遠期各升九元半至十一元、前市成交七千三百六十包、午後廠單無市、期紗上昂益勁、藍金市反硬、更使多方吸收之有加、允以投機家因其他市塲起伏較爲狹小、頗有捨彼而求此者、是以買氣濃厚、遂造高漲之局面、故九月期曾高達一五九二元、十月期一六一二元五角、十一月期一六三五元之高峯、旋經浮多稍出、微爲壓軟、結果九月期爲一五九一元、收市軋張二十元零五角、十月期爲一六一二元、上升二十允元五角、十一月期爲一六三三元、與開盤軋漲二十七元之多、全日共成交一萬六千五百四十包、比上日减少一千三百三十包、再將一日間開收高低價錄左（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<p>紡織廠之物料、因其種類繁多、故管理每感困難、其最大原因、乃缺乏適當之分類、茲爲謀各紡織廠物料管理之簡便及統一起見、胡君擬編製全國紡織廠物料統計一編、茲爲徵求各紡織廠機械廠及五金行之合作起見、凡有各種編目或其他材料供給者、可通訊寄至「上海大西路七十四號胡錫山君」、</p>
<h3>現棉索價過高　外棉定貨大旺</h3>
<p>定價廉於現貨七八十元</p>
<p>滬埠外　定貨交易、活潑堅昂、　而有之、良以國外棉市旣屬步漲、而一般投機者購意熱烈、同時又因外滙緊縮、及來源不湧之影響、本市外棉市况、實已處在牢不可破之堅定狀態也、近二週來、維持現貨情况無日不在堅挺之中、且同時更引起大多數紗廠及同業紛紛委託、各外商棉業　行、直接定購巴西棉或美棉之意向、其間雖因手續頗多麻煩、而耗費時日不少、但定價甚廉、恒與現貨市價相差七八十元之數、則又當爲一般花號家等所樂於定成者、連日如美棉米特林現貨售價必在六百七十元左右、但若訂購九十月抵滬之路貨、則仍不足六百元以下、因之旬日來各棉業洋行之交易熱鬧情况、已超出任何現貨市塲之興奮狀態、綜計每日成交總數皆逾一千四五百包以上、預料此後因各方人心一致看高、棉市前途、或將有史活躍之姿態表演也、</p>
<p>現棉情況大致挺秀、加之外棉回昂、人心更堅、不過價格過高、成交大爲减色、然執貨者深藏之觀念堅如鐵石也</p>
<h3>糖市　雙重壓力相乘　期糖一度見新高價</h3>
<p>昨糖市因荷輪應到未到、又有日商搜購、故囤戶更屬有機可乘、演成瘋在上漲之態、如九月十日期貨曾見一百四十一元之空前高峯、收盤略有回落、仍須在漲十餘元、其决漲六七八元不一、公司期貨二四粗白八月底交割者以一百二十七元開盤、旋升至二十八元六角、二十九元五角、下午更緊一百三十元、並高至三十八元半、收盤三十五元、升十一元六角、九月十日期一百二十八元牛、三十元九角、三十一元半、下午見四十一元最高價、旋回至三十五元二角、收盤三十六元六角、升十一元二角、公會划盤、現貨二四粗白七月份到貨一百二十八元半、三十一元半、下午三十五元二角、升七元七角、六片份一百二十七元至三十元、下午三十五元、升八元半、荷赤KD嘜一白二十元TN嘜一百十七元、下午一百二十二元、KD嘜一百二十五兀、升十元、計成交現貨八萬三千餘包、期貨七十餘包、香港粗白一百二十二元、下午二十八元、太古庫白B嘜一百五十八元、下午一百六十二元、升七元、DY嘜一百四十元、HX嘜一百三十二元、下午三十五元、升六元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑木耳步高</h3>
<p>黑木耳與香菰、本屬兄弟行產物、前市價亦曾亚駕齊驅、但邇來因香菰到存稀少、一再步漲、木耳已望塵莫及、近以來源不繼、亦稍見抬頭、昨稍高之貨、亦見九百八十元之高價、前後亦升二百外元云、</p>

<h3>水都市的風景綫</h3>
<p>— 方揚</p>
<p>沒有威脅，只有新奇！</p>
<p>老天，蓋滿了灰色的雲層。</p>
<p>洒不盡的雨水，像淚水似的，沒有流得盡。</p>
<p>這幾天來的上海，就在這愁雲苦雨中過渡着。</p>
<p>黃浦江的「河床」高了三尺，浦江裏潮來的時候，就在陸地上洶湧了！</p>
<p>上海變成了水的都市，不久的將來，或許可以超過威尼士的「水城」，而並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>馬路全都泡在水裏，黃浦裏的黃水，通過陰溝泛到地面上來的是汚黑的臭浪，人們在裏頭渡着，凖會叫「時疫醫院」「利市三倍」。</p>
<p>電車，汽車，公共汽車都變成了「渡輪」，機器的，又迅速，又穩當。但，不久，水再漲，「潮來了！」只得「拋錨」。於是，黃包車夫又走了「鴻運」，從暫時改一下名稱。）到那一頭</p>
<p>有閒朋友，開了汽車在水裏「尋開心」，開足了速力，「呼」一聲，車的兩旁直射出一大陣白色的水花，直奔到在走路的行人身上，臉上，包你冷冷的「怪舒服」，汽車裏也會笑哈哈的！</p>
<p>尤其，要是有女的走過，頂好是摩登些的，那末，騎自由車的「朋友」就艷福不淺，他會上去也是「呼」一陣子，有的還會叫聲——「阿姐，愜意哦？」哈哈一聲大笑向前了，興緻高的，更會來上幾圈，自已「長統靴」裏進水不要緊，只要有「荳腐」好吃，够了！</p>
<p>水浪，在車子走過後，就直向兩邊墻上衝，水深的地方人站不穩，「撲通」一聲！</p>
<p>在四馬路，大新街那裏，眼看着一位五十多歲的老太太，想跨過水街，不知脚底下踏着了什麽，就往前一仰，兩脚朝天了，傳來的又是笑聲。</p>
<p>那知，事出意料，鄧老人掉下水去不起來了，有人說：『水是『眞空』的，裏頭沒有氣，所以跌下去會死！』。</p>
<p>夜，給予水的，就更可貴，而值得驕傲。</p>
<p>紅紅綠綠的霓虹，在水光上反映，顯得更美麗，嬌艷。</p>
<p>影院，戲館，舞塲，昨夜還是繼續的客滿廣吿，可以在第二天的報上到處翻得到。</p>
<p>上海，充滿了寫意的人們。</p>
<p>水，給他們的沒有威脅，只是「新奇」。</p>
<p>乞丐，晚上沒處睡，浸在水裏。</p>
<p>普善山莊的報吿，秋凉後屍體增多。但不要緊——水，在上海還會大，還會多，我們等着瞧吧！</p>
<h3>不是幽默</h3>
<p>— 沛</p>
<p>乞丐：先生，我一天沒吃飯了，給五分錢，買個大餅吃吃吧。</p>
<p>行人：（一手持物，一手正握蛋糕大嚼，見乞丐，搖頭不顧）</p>
<p>乞丐：（牢釘不捨）</p>
<p>行人：討錢眼睛不睜睜開，你叫我怎樣拿錢給你？（邊言邊顧其待物和握半個蛋糕之雙手。）</p>
<p>乞丐：（一想却也不錯，捨之而去。）</p>
<h3>V字運動？</h3>

<p>這不是笑話，是事實。</p>
<p>據說，這回靑年會主辦的淸寒學生經濟補助的考試曾有這樣的一個題目。</p>
<p>何謂V字運動？</p>
<p>又據說，有很多人回答得很「高明」。現在抄錄幾個答案以供參考</p>
<p>V字運動就是報紙上所登的五洲大藥房Vitamine　A，B，C，D，E的廣吿。</p>
<p>有的說：當耶穌死的時候，曾發起一個運動，那運動就是V字運動。</p>
<p>重整舊道德運動就是V字運動。……云云。</p>

<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>但尙老　却是個天生的慢性人，什麽事情都急不來，在未說下文以前，還得先抽出一支老刀牌來，慢條厮理的擱在大指甲上樁上一陣然而才彎着腰，慢慢地走到一張小桌子邊去，取起一匣火柴來擦火。</p>
<p>劉禿子目不轉睛地望着他，急得心火直冒：那條蹺在板櫈上的右腿，放了下來又蹺上去，蹺了上去又放下來，倒像是在那裏練工。</p>
<p>「你來了究竟是……？」他終於忍不住向尙老二催問起來。</p>
<p>「吿訴你，最沒有辦法的倒是那個小丫頭自己！」尙老二銜着那支捲烟，在房裏來來回回的走着，一面怨氣冲天的說：「她簡直死也不願意再跟我學戲了。就是咱們能够把那老的嚇倒，她自己已變了心，還是沒有用的…。」</p>
<p>「那未就把她打死了再說！」在劉禿子的心坎裏，打死人眞比打死一頭蒼蠅還容易，彷彿法律就是他自己制定的。</p>
<p>「誰跟她抵命？這不是笑話嗎！」尙老二很陰沉地說：「我臨走的時候，她老子又打發我的外甥媳婦來說，他們願意先送我一百塊錢，將來要是梅寶跟她老子學會了戲，不論在什麼地方出台，不論掙多少包銀，最初的三年裏，每個月一定再送我一百塊錢…。」</p>
<p>他的話才說完，劉禿子方才所生的一肚子閑氣，便打鼻孔裏一起溜走了。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽不早說？佔了這樣的上風，你還有什麼不高興呢？」他立刻轉怒爲喜的說，充分顯出了他那組暴爽直的個性。「早知道這樣，我也不用白白的給你生氣了」（一九一）</p>

<p>積善積惡有其因果　揆之史實豈是迷信</p>
<p>近閱歷代名人家書，中有淸高安朱文端公（軾字若瞻一字可亭）與族人書，述歉歲賑荒意義之重大，可作孤島囤積食米諸公之當頭棒喝，爰亟錄之，以供同好。（以下原文）比聞吾鄕連年歉收，族中枵腹待斃者十之二一，而倉庾陳朽閉而不發者，亦間有之，噫，何其忍也？顧咸正賑荒答問云：「飢民一日得米數勺可以不死，計一歲每一石可救一人不死，荒年珠粒，僅有此數，不在飢民腹中，則在富室廩庾中，今閉一石不發，必有一人死者，閉十百千石不發，必有十百千人死者矣，然則除日給外，其餘廩庾中堆積者，皆堆積死人皮骨血肉腦髓也。失省一酒食之費，可活幾人。省一交際之費，可活幾人？省一簪珥衣被之費，可活幾人？省一布施僧道禮拜神像紙錢牲牢之費，可活幾人？以種種活人之物，而靡費於無用之地，以爲豪舉，是合數千百死人之皮骨血肉腦髓以爲豪舉也，忍乎不忍乎！」吾嘗推其說，以爲穀粟者，天所生以活人，偶寄吾廩庾中耳，而吾乃竊據天之所以活人者，轉而殺人，殺人者死，而况殺數千百無辜之飢民，罪深孽重，必有奇禍，近於其身，遠於其干若孫，是廩庾中陳陳相因者非從堆積飢民之皮骨血肉，實堆積其身及子若孫之不測奇禍也。</p>
<h3>汽車怕大水</h3>
<p>— 寗人</p>
<p>今年上海因爲　浦工作停頓，雨水也特別的多，所以一碰一潮大雨，馬路立刻就像黃浦，汽車變成汽船，可是汽車對於大水却有許多毛病，像要損傷優點，减少使用期限，和增加額外費用，譬如有輛汽車當在二尺深的大水中行駛，牠底下的車軸當然已經全部浸在水中如果其速度在芷常十五英里中進行，那末車軸上的機油無疑的大部均被洗掉，試想這筆油費照現在孤島情形再塗一次，計算起來，巳經很貴，其次什麽專司油滑的倍靈，汽油量的增高，和因着水太多侵入汽缸而拋錨，都足使備車者付一筆意外費用，除去上述各種情形外，更還會有因爲大水而將煞車的機構失去效用，即使在大水已退馬路盡乾，有時，司車者尙未將其煞車修好，那種危險對於馬路安全運動每生問題，屢見因駛車過速要煞住不可能而致不幸發生很多很多，據汽車內行說，汽車最不怕大水的要算福×牌，因爲牠的漏氣管的位置與衆不同，現在上海四大出租汽車對於大水生意據說很不歡迎，雖然出差的决數可以增加，然而因爲不能行駛通常速度，因此就供不能應求，失去了許多的客戶，而且，駛行速度過慢，汽油電費，和修理費用也會比率的增加。至於歡迎大水的，恐怕是人力車，在這塲合，正有着人力車夫發揮威力的好機會。</p>

<p>影迷意見</p>
<h3>改革影片說明書</h3>
<p>— 杰棟</p>
<p>每一部影片開映，都有一份說明書發給觀衆，這好像是一件極平常的事，而這份說明書雖不過只是說明這部影片里面的故事，但它的功用是在於幫助觀衆對劇情的瞭解，却不是純形式上的事。這樣說起來，一份說明書的組成便應該極嚴謹的，不是可以隨便敷衍了事。但一般影戲院當局對說明書大都並不重視，有的甚至視若可有可無，有幾家大影戲院對說明書雖頗加注意，但也不過是所用的紙張與印刷方面的考究，才免是偏重於形式的。</p>
<p>一份完美的說明書第一個條件便是它的內容是充實的，不僅是所用的紙張與印刷方面的考究而已。講到說明書的內容是指它的文字而言，一般說明書的文字都是用文言文，很多陳套，也許是因爲要求典雅的緣故，但有時反變成艱澀難讀。旣然說明書是在說明藏在影片裏面的故事，幫助觀衆對劇情的了解，那末它應該是以淺顯明暢爲主，同時觀衆的程度是極不一致的，必須爲大多數人着想，不能專為少數程度高的而把說明書寫得很艱深，那是無裨於實際的。</p>
<p>曾經有一個時期頗有幾家影戲院對說明書的文字很加注意，但這個時期極短，不久就過去了。很希望各影戲院當局重起提倡，使說明書能充分表達出它的功用，不背所以有說明書的本義。而除了說明故事外，對本劇的主旨作一個簡括的提示，那也是很需要的，因爲它可以更進一步的增進觀衆對該劇的認識。曾見到某幾部影片的說明書採用過這個方式，如「蠟像陳列所的秘密」的說明書開頭有一小段「主旨」，說明該劇的主題。又如「賽金花」的說明書，雖不曾標明那一段是「主旨」，那一段才是「本事」的正文，但開頭也一樣有這樣的一小段的文字。不過採有這種的少得很，眞是什不一見，這是很値得仿行，不會是沒有意義的。</p>
<p>（編者按）電影說明書的確可予觀衆不少的便利，尤其外國影片，必須先看說明書，繼能瞭解劇情；否則英語程度幼稚的，甚至不懂英語的人，費去兩小時光陰，簡直如墮五里霧中，而减少了他們觀影的興趣。有些用功的青年，往往把中英文對照的說明書收藏起來，當作自修讀物，你想其重要性爲何如？杰棟君的意見，貢獻給中外各影院，我認爲値得參考的。</p>
<p>火炬劇社成立在民國二十五年的冬季，當時由夏霞，賀賓，黃河，張國光諸人之發起，曾數度演出，戰後因社員星散，以致社務無形停頓，目今他們又活躍起來，設社址於大沽路永慶坊二十四號，籌備復興公演。聞劇目定英國羅道夫裴斯原著之五幕名劇「愛」，由張國光改譯導演，將於月底演出於俄國藝術劇院。</p>

<h3>US Will Announce Total Embargo, To Confer with Australia on Cooperative Aid to China</h3>
<p>Hopes for the Resumption of Trade Negotiations Between the US and Japan Dashed; Netherlands Indies and Hong Kong Strengthen the Effectiveness of Export Restrictions</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 20th - According to well-informed sources, the US government will soon announce a total embargo on various raw materials. President Roosevelt yesterday further expanded the list of embargoed goods, adding six categories including fur, mixed fibers, asphalt, raw asphalt, non-ferrous metals, and precious metals. This restriction is expected to take effect around September 10th. Responsible officials stated that while US-controlled export trade will reach approximately 80%, a total embargo will still be implemented soon. The underlying reason is to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials needed for the US defense industry, so that the US can fulfill its obligations to China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Pan-American countries. It is said that Japan will be the most affected by the implementation of this restriction, while China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Pan-American countries will be given priority.</p>
<p>London, 20th - According to reliable sources, although the reaction to the Netherlands Indies' freezing of Japanese assets and imposing an economic blockade has been moderate, Dutch officials still believe that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a direct threat to the security of the Netherlands Indies. Therefore, all items that could enhance Japan's war economy are prohibited from export.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 21st - Authorities here believed yesterday that Australia and the United States have been engaged in diplomatic discussions regarding cooperation in China. This news was disclosed following a meeting on Tuesday night between the Australian Minister to Washington, Casey, Under Secretary of State Welles, and Presidential Administrative Assistant Currie. Casey and State Department officials declined to reveal the purpose of the meeting. However, one responsible party stated that Currie's involvement must relate to aid to China. Unofficial speculation suggests that this aid will include steel, cement, and aircraft parts commonly used for the Burma Road or the parallel railway currently under construction.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - It was recently learned from well-informed sources that an attempt to establish temporary measures to ease the current strained relations between Japan and the United States through negotiations between Tokyo and Washington has failed. The two sides have met no less than fifteen times, but each has insisted on its own position, refusing to concede. Two days ago, the US government, through Ambassador Grew, notified the Japanese government that if Japan does not modify its attitude, the current negotiations are unlikely to succeed. Therefore, the hope for the resumption of trade between the two countries will also vanish, and the established facts of frozen funds and restrictions on Pacific trade will be extended indefinitely and will no longer be temporary measures. Responsible parties in Tokyo are also extremely nervous. The frequent contacts between US Ambassador Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda and Vice Foreign Minister Terasaki prove the urgency of the situation. In addition, widespread rumors that negotiations between the two sides on the issue of the withdrawal of American citizens have stalled have further unsettled the local American community. Since the US and Japan mutually imposed freezing measures, the two sides have begun negotiations in an attempt to establish temporary measures, not only on economic matters but also on political issues, seeking a basis for resolution, at least hoping to guarantee several months of peace between the US and Japan. It is said that the United States has adopted a firm attitude in the negotiations. Although some appeasement measures may be taken economically, certain conditions must be obtained politically, namely, Japan must truly retreat. According to the views of neutral observers, the situation in the Far East has completely changed, because the two Anglo-Saxon powers have now taken the initiative and have abandoned the appeasement concept of the past two years. In Japan, on the contrary, a defensive stance has been adopted, and its situation is becoming increasingly isolated. The "encirclement policy" mentioned by the Japanese is no longer just a slogan of the propaganda machine, but a terrifying reality. Furthermore, according to repeated statements from those close to the government, if Britain and the United States continue to tighten the encirclement of Japan, Japan will be forced to take extreme measures. It would be a mistake for outsiders to regard this as purely propaganda, because, according to Japan's claim, based on the experience of the past few years, especially the experience of the sanctions imposed on Italy in 1935, it would rather break through the blockade than submit to suffocation. At the same time, neutral observers who know the national character of Japan also said that Japan is the same as Italy, its endurance is great, but once a decision is made, it will disregard everything.</p>
<h3>Red Lights Hang North and South, Japan is Already Aware of Being Surrounded</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st - As the world's resistance to Nazism and aggression has reached a consensus, attention here has refocused on the Far East, and Japan's extraordinary strategy of preventing American citizens from leaving the country is particularly noteworthy. Fortunately, the American people's attention to the Far East has been heightened. It is widely felt that in recent weeks, especially after the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, the world situation has greatly changed. China, Britain, and the Soviet Union are now all fighting, the Netherlands Indies is preparing for war, and the United States remains a non-belligerent ally. The United States' moral support for the Soviet Union is now gradually turning into material assistance. Therefore, Japan's position in the East is deteriorating day by day. As the New York Times said, red lights hang north and south to guard against Japan, and Japan's hope that it can proceed with its steps without being punished must have been extinguished in the long talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda and US Ambassador Grew on Sunday. The New York Times also said that there is good reason to believe that US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill have decided on a joint course of action to deal with Japan's new steps. According to observations here, Japan's next step is to join the world war, but Japan is now worried about being in a situation where it will encounter major resistance everywhere, and it will encounter a combined military force that it cannot cope with safely. Japan cannot obtain the slightest assistance from its Axis allies, and it is also gradually realizing that it is useless to be a tool for others, or it may not dare to act rashly. One thing that observers here have noted is that as the strong front of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States has developed, Japanese newspapers have said that Britain and the United States are currently destroying the neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and that Japan and the Soviet Union are now trying to strengthen their peaceful relations. But then, is Japan's recent dispatch of large forces to Manchuria and Mongolia a proposal to strengthen peaceful relations between Japan and the Soviet Union? Japan is indeed surrounded today, but it is surrounded by its own unassisted efforts. According to the sentiments here, even the most ardent advocates of war in Tokyo must know that the strength of one country alone cannot compete with the five countries of China, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands Indies, Britain, and the United States.</p>
<h3>Britain Claims No Consideration Given to Unfreezing Japanese Funds</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Responsible parties in London stated yesterday that there is currently no question of Britain and Japan concluding a barter agreement or unfreezing Japanese funds. The banking mechanism established between the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank is merely to prepare for the special issuance of trade licenses in special circumstances. Each license must have its value in terms of British supply, and the consideration of supply must conflict with the consideration of economic warfare. It would be a mistake to refer to this mechanism as an appeasement measure. The measures agreed upon by the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank do not change the situation announced recently in the House of Commons by British Foreign Secretary Eden. The current measures stipulate the basis on which licenses can be issued, but this basis is extremely narrow. When the freezing of Japanese funds was announced, it was already known that licenses could be issued in some limited circumstances, but this kind of transaction must be very limited, for two reasons: 1. Export goods from Britain to Japan cannot be shipped out if their value exceeds the value of Japanese imports that the British authorities deem appropriate. 2. Britain is not bound by any goods, and Britain does not have the obligation to supply the British goods that Japan wants to obtain.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 21st - Authorities here said yesterday that under the measures currently under discussion, "Japanese earnings from the frozen funds will be no more than a few thousand pounds." It is understood that the normal turnover of trade between Britain and Japan in peacetime is about 7 million pounds. Officials declared that the current measures are purely to assist British and Japanese embassies and consulates, and there is no intention to expand this kind of convenience. Officials declared that Britain has not issued export permits to Japan since the funds were frozen. Authorities insisted, "Britain has adopted an extremely stern attitude towards any action by Japan in the Far East. Britain has taken full defense measures in Malaya and elsewhere." Authorities said that Britain has not given Thailand a special guarantee of armed support, but there is no doubt as to what the British sentiment is.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st - The Hong Kong government has recently ordered the expansion of the area for the shipment of export goods, in addition to Germany and its occupied areas, Japan and its territories, mandated territories, and Manchuria are also included. The Hong Kong government issued this to strengthen the effectiveness of its measures against Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Discusses Current Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Bus Service to be Banned from September; Rice and Bread Also to be Rationed</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - Most newspapers here have detailed the Finance Minister's speech at the Tokyo Bankers Club, regarding the financial crisis and domestic countermeasures. As for Thailand and other international issues, there has been no progress, so they do not occupy an important place in the report.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st - The Japanese government has decided to ban the use of gasoline-powered streetcars, buses, and private cars from September 1st in order to preserve the gasoline supply. However, private cars used for special accidents are exempt from the ban. Buses that do not use gasoline as fuel can operate as usual, but bus stops will be abolished.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 21st - An Indian who arrived here yesterday from Japan on a Japanese ship said that bread is not sold in Japan for six days each month, and that butter and cheese are supplied in small quantities and are quite expensive. Rice and bread have already been rationed. There were a total of 40 Indian passengers on board the ship.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Martial Law Declared by Britain in Syria</h3>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 21st - Parisian newspapers yesterday carried a news report from Ankara saying that Britain has declared martial law throughout Syria. It is said that this declaration of martial law by Britain was made after the conflict between British troops and Arab soldiers in Aleppo.</p>
<h3>French Diplomatic Personnel Pledge Allegiance to Free France</h3>
<p>United Press, San Jose, Costa Rica, 21st - The French Consul and the Secretary of the French Embassy here resigned yesterday to the Vichy government and accepted the same positions appointed by General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French movement.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Six Steps Agreed Upon by Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 21st - According to reliable sources revealed today, Britain and the United States have agreed on a six-point plan regarding Germany: (1) To provide as much material assistance to the Soviet Union as possible, and encourage the Soviet Union to continue resisting Germany. (2) To continue to aid China and intensify the encirclement of Japan. (3) To greatly increase British forces in the Mediterranean region to prevent the German army from launching an offensive in the region. (4) To quickly increase US aid to Britain and expand the British air force. (5) If necessary, to occupy Iran, Daga, Athos Islands, Cape Verde, and even Turkey before the German army. (6) In the present and coming years, Britain will mainly adopt a defensive position against Germany, and in 1943, it will launch an offensive against Europe. The above six-point plan represents the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Factor of Time</h3>
<p>Recently, President Roosevelt, upon returning from his sea voyage, met with reporters and pointed out that this war would be a long and arduous one, warning the people not to be overly optimistic about current achievements, and also indicating that the war may continue until the end of 1943. The United States is currently considering the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the next two years and how the United States can supply them. At the same time, within Italian Fascism, there has recently been some controversy regarding the duration of the European war. On the 19th, the Fascist political system newspaper published an editorial severely criticizing the view of some people in Italian political circles that the European war would be extended for ten years, stating that if after ten years of war, both the victorious and defeated countries will be uninhabited. It can be seen that the time factor is an important factor in the current war, and both democratic countries and Axis countries are paying great attention to it.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily uncommon for a war to last for ten years. In European history, there were famous Thirty Years' War and Hundred Years' War. In the past few years, people who pay attention to current events in the Far East have probably heard similar grand pronouncements from time to time. However, those who dare to make grand pronouncements may not necessarily have the strength to match them, and the so-called Thirty Years' War and Hundred Years' War mostly refer to the sum of several non-continuous wars, and they were also events that occurred in the era when firearms were not yet widely used. With the great consumption and alarming destruction of modern warfare, it is naturally impossible to compare it with the concept of warfare in the Middle Ages. On this point, perhaps the Fascist view above is correct. But such an observation only touches the surface of the problem.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, aggressor nations benefit from a swift and decisive victory, while the resistance to aggression emphasizes protracted warfare. This strategic divergence is caused by different subjective conditions and has been decided since the beginning of the war. The "have" and "have-not" theory that the aggressors use as an excuse is meaningless, but in terms of waging war, today's aggressors are not countries with vast territories, large populations, and abundant resources. In order to obtain war materials, aggressors depend on the world market much more urgently than democratic countries, which hold world sea power and whose territories and countries span the globe. However, under the blockade and embargo of the opposing side, what they can obtain and apply is only the production of their homeland and occupied areas and the stockpiles of pre-war materials. With limited sources to supply endless consumption, it goes without saying that they cannot engage in long-term warfare. What's more, in addition to economic problems, the stability of the aggressor nations' regimes is mostly based on high-pressure rule and the establishment of external achievements. Expansion that cannot be achieved quickly and as desired will inevitably lead to the surfacing of internal latent crises. Sacrificing butter to make cannons may be understandable from the perspective of preparing for war, but at the same time, it also lays down a dangerous factor. In essence, the ultimate goal of the sacrifice is to obtain more butter. If the result only leads to long-term suffering and sacrifice, then the people's endurance of pain also has its greatest limit, especially since the aggressors have no reason to resort to war in the first place. Therefore, the views of the political system newspaper are essentially an expression of depression, which is the common depression of all countries in a situation similar to that of Italy.</p>
<p>However, in Nazi Germany, the recent situation seems to be that, although it is no longer the arrogant and reckless behavior after the great victory on the Western Front last summer, its offensive strength has not yet reached the stage of exhaustion. In the recent Soviet-German war, the strong will of the Germanic nation is being demonstrated and is still constantly progressing, but it is still a huge and difficult task. At the same time, even though the Nazis are also eager for a swift and decisive victory, at present, the above-mentioned factors have not caused serious damage to their war machine. This is probably why President Roosevelt wants to warn the American people about a long-term war. Based on the experience of the past few years, whether in the East or the West, the time factor has played a major role. The current situation may not be entirely satisfactory, but it cannot be denied that there has been significant progress in this long process. Recently, the international situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and there are signs of approaching a final settlement, but the use of time should still not be taken lightly. On the other hand, it is important not to be overly obsessed with the idea of a swift victory, and to neglect how to allow the aggressors to continue to suffer from the impact of the time factor. The counter-offensive against the aggressors is what the world is eagerly hoping for, but the conditions for the maturity of the counter-offensive still depend on the greater consumption of the opposing side and the continued strengthening of one's own strength. Today, in the world's three major wars, the situation in the Far East has become a stalemate, the main force has not yet clashed in Western Europe, and in Eastern Europe, both sides are using all their strength to fight for space and time. As for the various aggressor nations, their combat power may still be superior, but the three conditions of land, people, and resources are beyond the reach of the anti-aggression front. Their peace offensive, attempting to take risks to achieve their goals, is an expression of anxiety and impatience, and it is also the embarrassing state exposed under the heavy pressure of time. The central issue at present is not local victory or defeat and advance or retreat, but how to target the objective situation of all parties so that the aggressors can be fatally struck at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the war will truly continue until the end of 1943, the anti-aggression nations must have the determination to fight a long and hard battle. This is the underlying meaning of President Roosevelt's remarks. The sacrifice and destruction of war are inevitable, but the end of a long-term war is definitely not that both warring countries become uninhabited, but rather the destruction of the aggressors and the extinction of the crimes of aggression.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane That Attacked Zhongxian Shot Down by China</h3>
<p>All Four People on Board Died; Liuzhou and Hengyang Also Attacked</p>
<p>Chongqing, 19th - A Japanese army plane that attacked Zhongxian was shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft units and crashed near Fengjie. The Japanese side acknowledged this on the 20th in a broadcast. The personnel on the plane were Lieutenant Matsumoto Zensaku, Sergeant Major Okawa, Sergeant Shizaki, and Corporal Ishiguchi, all four of whom also died. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - Thirty-one Japanese planes invaded Liuzhou this afternoon in two batches from Vietnam, dropping bombs in the north and south of Henan, destroying many civilian houses. Longzhou was also bombed this afternoon. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang - Twenty-six Japanese planes attacked Hengyang from Hubei on the morning of the 20th. After intense anti-aircraft fire, the Japanese planes dropped bombs in the suburbs and escaped by the original route. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - In the past few days, Japanese planes flying from bases in northern Vietnam have increased their activity in southwestern China. In addition to the air raid on Kunming, points along the Burma Road have also been bombed. It is reported that 31 Japanese planes bombed Liuzhou in southern Guangxi yesterday, and Qinzhou on the Vietnamese border was also attacked. Twenty-six Japanese planes bombed Hengyang in southern Hunan yesterday morning. It is believed that these Japanese planes came from Hankou. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, Chinese sources said that Kunming recently suffered the longest air raid. President Chiang Kai-shek has allocated 300,000 yuan to relieve the families of the victims. From August 9th to 17th, Japanese planes bombed Kunming six times in eight days. (21st United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>British and American Nationals Withdraw from Manchuria and Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>British and American Embassies Say They Know Nothing; Japanese Say All Foreigners are Not Allowed to Enter Manchuria</p>
<p>Beiping - It was learned today that regarding the withdrawal of British and American nationals from Manchuria, the British and American embassies have not received any news. The embassies said that they have not been notified that British and American nationals have withdrawn from Manchuria because their businesses have been completely suspended due to the freezing orders. Japanese sources said that more than 100 British and American nationals have withdrawn from Manchuria - especially Harbin - and will arrive in Tianjin today. Japanese sources also said that British and American nationals have left Manchuria because their businesses have been completely suspended, taking advantage of the Japanese order allowing foreigners to leave Manchuria before August 18th. At present, all foreigners, regardless of whether they had previously resided in Manchuria, are not allowed to enter Manchuria. (21st United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Plummet in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Measures for Fixing Prices and Purchasing Rice Announced; 12 Million Piculs Can be Obtained Annually</p>
<p>Chongqing - Rice prices have plummeted in various parts of Sichuan Province. According to the Ministry of Food, this is mostly due to hoarders selling off their stocks in large quantities when they saw the new grain coming onto the market. In the previous two weeks, rice prices in various places fell by between 40 and 100 yuan per picul. The current lowest price is 104 yuan per picul, and the highest price is 245 yuan per picul in Chongqing. The Sichuan Provincial Government has announced a resolution to forcibly requisition and purchase grain in the province, estimating that each county will supply 200,000 piculs of grain, half to be used for land tax and the remainder to be purchased by the government. The government has decided to pay 30% in cash for the purchases, and the remaining 70% will be paid in food storage coupons. The cotton harvest in Shaanxi Province this year is quite good, with a total of 2 million mu of land planted with cotton. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The measures for fixing prices and purchasing rice in Sichuan Province have recently been announced. For every picul of grain submitted by farmers, they will receive 7斗 of food storage coupons and 30 yuan in legal tender. According to government estimates, Sichuan Province can purchase 6 million piculs of grain in accordance with this measure, and another 6 million piculs can be obtained through the actual levy of land tax, for a total of 12 million piculs. Also, according to this fixed price, it is no different from the government currently fixing the grain price at 100 yuan per picul, which is equivalent to a rice price of 200 yuan. However, according to a survey by the authorities, in early July, the highest rice price in various counties of Sichuan Province was 451 yuan in Nanchong, and the lowest was 110 yuan in Xiushan. Subsequently, when the new grain came onto the market, the price fell by between 5 yuan and 140 yuan per picul. Therefore, the current highest market price is 349 yuan in Nanchong, and the lowest is still in Xiushan, at 104 yuan. On average, it is 250 yuan per picul. Yesterday, the rice price in Chongqing was 140 yuan, 260 yuan in Chengdu, and 280 yuan in the Zigong area. These three places are the most heavily consumed areas in Sichuan Province. More than a month ago, there were several panic phenomena, but they have now stabilized. (21st Havas World News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>English Newspaper Praises China: People's Unity and Strong Will</h3>
<p>Will Occupy an Important Position in the Future World Organization: The US-UK Talks Did Not Neglect the Issue of Aid to China</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 21st: The Times newspaper published an article praising China's strength and resilience in combat, stating that under the stimulation of common danger and the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, China has emerged from years of internal strife and anarchy. The Chinese people are increasingly united and their will is strengthened as they struggle to preserve their country's existence. The Chinese army is now very complete, and its sophisticated tactics have forced the attacks of the better-equipped Japanese mechanized army into a stalemate. The recent bombing of Chongqing does not seem to have had any effect on the military situation. The Chinese people have suffered greatly and endured hardships for a long time, and no form of threat is sufficient to shake their will. Looking around the world, it is doubtful whether any other country has such a firm belief in final victory as China. In Japan's various changing and eccentric policies, China has always been its main priority and greatest concern. This Japanese policy has been in place for fifty years. The report further stated that the recent development of Japan's increased military strength in the South is partly due to the Japanese army's desire to regain the face lost by its long failure to end the China incident, but also to seal off China in the South, cut off the few supply routes that still continue, and force China to submit, because Vietnam is now a base for strengthening military operations against China and a starting point for Japan's continued advance south. Although President Roosevelt and the British government have made it clear that all threats and sweet words that would induce them to sacrifice China and negotiate with Japan are equally insignificant, the leaders of Japanese policy have never given up hope of using more direct threats to British and American interests elsewhere to force the two countries to tacitly recognize Japan's hegemony in China. The report also stated that China's greatest asset is its invincible will to resist, followed by the sympathy and assistance of countries other than Japan that have interests in the Far East. As for Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, on the whole, China may have benefited from its heartfelt trust in the resumption of aid to the Soviet Union. At present, a strong Soviet army is stationed in eastern Siberia, ready to resist any Japanese actions in the area. The Chinese and Soviet armies have now become part of a great fortress against Japan's continued advance. Today, it is no exaggeration to speak of the entire defensive line, because the Japanese policy itself extends from the Amur River (Heilongjiang) through China to Thailand and Singapore and as far as the Dutch East Indies. The report strongly stated that the British policy in the Far East is completely in line with that of the United States. British direct aid to China is limited only by Britain's own urgent needs. At present, we can speculate that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will certainly not ignore the issue of aid to China. The report concluded that China will occupy an extremely important position in the future organization of the world.</p>
<h3>The Three-Power Conference Will Discuss the Issue of Material Assistance</h3>
<p>It is Said That the United States Intends to Lend Money to the Soviet Union: Thousands of Tons of Machine Tools Will Be Shipped Immediately</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 21st: A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated that the main issue facing the anti-Axis front today is to provide the Soviet Union with the greatest possible assistance without delay. This was one of the topics discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill at the meeting in the Atlantic, and it will also be the task of the three-country conference, which will be held soon in Moscow, in order to effectively carry out this task. As for the candidates for the British and American representatives attending the three-country conference, it has not yet been announced. This seems to confirm that Lord Beaverbrook will serve as the main British representative, and will go to Moscow as soon as his public affairs in the United States are completed. He is indeed very suitable for handling the specific issues of supply and distribution. Since the discussions of the three countries will be limited to goods and supplies, the participants in the meeting may not only be military representatives. It is heard that the American representative will be Harriman, who assisted in the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act to the United Kingdom. The United States is now showing signs of stepping up assistance to the Soviet Union, such as the suggestion that American bombers should fly from Alaska to Siberia and arrive on the Eastern Front. This move can not only save transportation time, but also allow the aircraft to immediately go into battle when they arrive, and its impact on the Soviet Union's air offensive is self-evident.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: United States Federal Loan Administrator Jones told reporters yesterday that the United States is prepared to lend money to the Soviet Union to facilitate its purchase of war equipment in the United States. If the US authorities adopt aid to the Soviet Union as a policy, and the Soviet Union is unable to pay cash, then he thinks the United States can find a way to help them. He believes this is a loan rather than a lease method. The Soviet Union has not yet formally requested a loan, but there have already been hints of this.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 21st: The World Telegram reported yesterday that thousands of tons of machine tools, now en route to Vancouver, are ready to be shipped to the Soviet Union. The report also stated that these machine tools were originally ordered by France and have now been resold to the Soviet Union. It is also said that the Soviet Union's purchase of these goods is a cash transaction.</p>
<h3>One German Plane Raids Iceland</h3>
<p>United Press, Reykjavik, 21st: An American-made British "Tomahawk" fighter plane yesterday chased a German bomber flying over Iceland. The air raid alarm sounded here at 7:00 AM when the twin-engine bomber flew over the city, lasting for fifteen minutes. The huge bomber escaped into the clouds without dropping bombs. Yesterday was the first time a German bomber invaded the island since the United States occupied Iceland on July 7. The German bomber is expected to have flown 700 miles from its base in Norway.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had not heard the news that a German plane flew over Iceland and was driven away by a fighter plane. If this is true, then the fighter plane must be owned by the United Kingdom, because he knows that there are no American fighter planes in Iceland.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 21st: The Navy Department yesterday refused to comment on the Iceland air raid news, except to say that it did not use "Tomahawk" aircraft. A telegram from Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) stated that the American-made "Tomahawk" fighter plane, or perhaps piloted by a British pilot, drove away a German bomber flying over Iceland yesterday morning. Although the Army Department uses "Tomahawk" aircraft, it refused to explain that the Army was the first to participate in the Navy's first batch to Iceland. The current number of American troops in Iceland is a military secret, but it is estimated to be 20,000. The highest number of British troops is between 60,000 and 80,000. It is heard that American giant transport ships carrying reinforcements arrived in Iceland on August 7.</p>
<h3>Oil Shortage in the Eastern United States: More Severe Controls Will Be Adopted</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: United States Petroleum Coordinator Davies claimed yesterday that the eastern states of the United States only have a ten-day supply of oil. The oil shortage in the East, which has long been expected, has now been realized. The situation can be considered serious, and a more severe control plan must be implemented in addition to the current oil distribution law.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister King Arrives in the UK</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 21st: Canadian Prime Minister King arrived in London this morning. Dominion Minister Lord Cranborne, Aviation Minister Sinclair, Prime Minister Churchill's representative Thompson, and representatives of the Canadian government and army were all waiting at the station. After King arrived, he made a statement saying that the United Kingdom will surely achieve final victory, and said that his stay in the United Kingdom will not be very long. King then had a long talk with Prime Minister Churchill.</p>
<h3>Rumors That Japan Plans to Build Two Concentration Camps</h3>
<p>Located in the Occupied Areas of China</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 21st: Mr. Jekel, the manager of a carpet company here, said yesterday that his business partner in the Far East recently telegraphed that the Japanese army is building two large concentration camps in the occupied areas of China for British and American people. American industrialists and exporters have been openly threatened with imprisonment. He also said that he went to Beidaihe during Easter last year and personally saw a concentration camp under construction.</p>
<h3>The US Navy Has Entered a Wartime State</h3>
<p>Many Officials Tend to Participate in the War</p>
<p>United Press, on an American patrol ship in the Atlantic, 21st: After completing a ten-day trip yesterday, reporters learned that American warships are actually operating in a state of war, following President Roosevelt's instructions to maintain the tranquility of the sea route and maintain the United States' promise of supplies. Reporters spent ten days on the warship, sailing 2,600 miles. The cannons on the ship were ready to fight at any time. Wireless silence was maintained except in extremely serious circumstances. A curfew was implemented every night, and there were sensitive listening devices to prevent aircraft and submarines. The name of this device cannot be published due to naval restrictions. There are many people on board. The ship the reporter was on is one of the most powerful in the US Navy. The sentiment of those who advocate participating in the war is stronger in the Navy. The reporter met a Navy man who wrote on a large bomb, "This is reserved for Hitler." Other shells were similarly marked, to be enjoyed by German Aviation Minister Goering and German Propaganda Minister Goebbels.</p>
<h3>Duke of Kent to Arrive in the US Next Week</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Decides to Host Him Personally</p>
<p>Reuter's, Ottawa, 21st: The Duke of Kent, the brother of the King of England, yesterday wore a miner's hat and clothes to inspect an Ontario gold mine for an hour, then changed out of the mine and put on the uniform of an air force commander, visited the miners' sports field, and then took a car for 38 miles and boarded a plane to Toronto.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: President Roosevelt went to Hyde Park Villa today and will host the Duke of Kent, the brother of the King of England, there at the end of this week. On Sunday, the Duke of Kent will return to Washington with the President and stay at the White House. At that time, he will visit the national defense factories in Norfolk and Baltimore.</p>
<h3>Australian Interior Minister Delivers Farewell Broadcast</h3>
<p>About to Leave Singapore</p>
<p>Singapore, 10th: Australian Interior Minister Foll delivered a farewell broadcast here tonight, saying, "After my trip here, I am convinced of two things: (1) Anyone who wants to attack Singapore must think twice; (2) The firmer the attitude of us and our allies, the less likely it is that war will occur in the Pacific." He and several Australian reporters will return to Australia.</p>
<h3>US Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply: Will Reach 50 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is Also Cooperating with British Officials to Reduce the British Dollar Burden</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: US defense program expenditure reached US$51,000,000,000 yesterday (equivalent to £12,750,000,000). With the expected second batch of Lend-Lease funding, the total will increase to more than US$55,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 21st: According to those responsible, the US Treasury Department is currently cooperating with British personnel to reduce the British dollar burden. The US Treasury Department is now planning a plan so that the US government can assume the obligation to pay for part of the orders placed by the United Kingdom in the United States before the Lend-Lease Act was established based on the Lend-Lease Act. However, it has not yet been decided how much of the payment the United States can receive. The Wall Street Journal claimed that the US government will be responsible for one-third of the payment, which is considered an exaggeration by well-informed sources here.</p>
<p>Reuter's, New York, 21st: A Wall Street Journal dispatch from Washington stated that one of the main points being discussed by British Cabinet member Beaverbrook and the US President is the issue of the United Kingdom paying for the value of national defense supplies ordered from the US when the Lend-Lease Act was not yet implemented. According to reliable sources, he has requested that it be valued at $1,500,000,000.</p>

<h3>Far East Aviation Expansion</h3>
<p>Chongqing It is expected today that there will soon be an increase in American or Sino-American joint commercial aviation in the Far East. It is reported that Pan American Airlines will add four new S-43 aircraft to fly between Manila and Hong Kong and Manila and Singapore, so that the current service of once every two weeks can be increased to twice a week. China National Aviation Corporation will have six new Douglas DC-3 aircraft added to fly on various routes in China, greatly increasing its passenger and cargo capacity. Traffic on the above-mentioned airlines has greatly increased, and there is a lack of sufficient aircraft to cope with it, so it is very crowded. After the addition of new aircraft, congestion can be slightly reduced (United Press, 21st)</p>

<h3>Italian Fascist Newspaper Again Reports That Chairman Chiang Will Go to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Alliance Between China and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 21st According to a message from the capital of Sweden published in the extreme fascist newspaper, Chairman Chiang will go to Moscow in a short period of time to discuss the future actions of the Soviet Union in the Far East. It also said, "A Chinese military delegation has now arrived in Moscow to discuss increasing Soviet assistance to China." It is also learned that Chairman Chiang is about to go to Moscow to discuss with Soviet military leaders the issue of China and the Soviet Union being smart to resist Japan.</p>
<h3>The Focus of the Soviet-German War Remains in the Central Gomel Region</h3>
<p>German forces are likely to advance north, eyeing Moscow. Finnish forces make little progress in attacking Leningrad.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 21st: Fierce fighting continued along the entire Soviet-German front on the night of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, especially in the central Gomel and Novgorod sectors.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 21st: A new major battle is underway in the Gomel region of Soviet Byelorussia (175 miles southwest of Smolensk, 140 miles northeast of Kiev). Recent Soviet communiqués only mention fierce fighting in this area yesterday. A special communiqué from Hitler's headquarters states: "The battles around and north of Gomel have ended. The Soviet forces have been heavily defeated. The 17th Infantry Division, the 1st Mechanized Corps, the 2nd Armored Divisions, the 5th Cavalry Divisions, and a portion of two Airborne Brigades have been defeated, annihilated, or captured by the German forces. The German forces captured 78,000 enemy soldiers, seized 144 tanks, 700 artillery pieces, and two armored trains." The direction of the new German offensive in the Gomel region is still unclear, likely aiming north to assist the central sector and eye Moscow. It is also possible that the German forces, stalled around Smolensk, are initiating a new offensive to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Details of continuous Soviet counterattacks around Smolensk have recently emerged from Moscow. According to a Soviet newspaper, a Soviet unit突进, overcoming five villages and inflicting heavy damage on the German forces. Another report states that a unit of soldiers, surrounded west of 斯克 six weeks ago, has now broken through,冲过 the German lines for 200 miles, and rejoined the main force led by General Timoshenko. The German side previously claimed to have occupied all of Ukraine west of the Dnieper River, but now admits that many Soviet troops are still fiercely resisting in this area. German forces on the northern front are continuing to advance through Novgorod towards Leningrad, which is 100 miles to the northwest of that city. Fighting is also ongoing at Kingisepp on the Estonian border. Finnish forces, looking south towards Leningrad, have made little progress and admit that Soviet forces are counterattacking.</p>
<p>The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following communiqué at midnight: On August 10th, Soviet forces engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy at Kingisepp (70 miles southwest of Leningrad), Novgorod (100 miles southeast of Leningrad), Staraya Russa (south of Lake Ilmen), Gomel (175 miles southwest of Smolensk), and Odessa. According to confirmed reports, 28 enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles on August 18th. The previous figure of 30 was inaccurate. On August 19th, 27 enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles, with the Soviets losing 8 aircraft. On the afternoon of August 20th, Soviet fighter planes shot down three German reconnaissance planes near Moscow.</p>
<p>Moscow, Reuters, 21st: The Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Northern Front, Voroshilov, the leader of the Leningrad region, Zhdanov, and the Mayor, Popkov, have jointly issued a moving appeal to all Soviet citizens in the Leningrad region, urging them to defend the city to the last person, and stating that the Red Army is bravely defending the roads leading to the city. The Soviet Navy and Air Force are also continuing to inflict heavy blows on the enemy.</p>
<p>Moscow, Reuters, 21st: The government has announced the formation of new National Guard units to assist the Red Army in strengthening defenses.</p>
<p>Soviet Troops Surrounded West of Minsk Break Through and Rejoin Main Forces</p>
<p>Moscow, United Press, 21st: The troops led by General Boldin, which were surrounded by German forces west of Minsk in July, have broken through after 45 days of resistance and rejoined other Red Army units. General Boldin engaged the main German lines on August 11th, and then, in cooperation with General Konaf's troops from the Soviet side, launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions. After a short battle, General Boldin's troops broke through the enemy lines, killing over a thousand German officers and soldiers, destroying five artillery positions, and 100 motorcycles. General Boldin stated that his troops were surrounded on all sides and split into two by the Germans, but continued to attack the German rear. His troops then attacked the German front, rear, and flanks, eventually approaching the breach created by the German forces (meaning the German forces that had cut off the Soviet troops) and attacking again. He also stated that when his troops returned from Minsk, they repelled 50 German tanks disguised as Soviet tanks, destroying 26 of them. He further stated that on the way to rejoin the Red Army, he was reinforced by other surrounded Soviet troops, crossing swamps and forests, fighting and advancing, and maintaining contact with the main force by radio. He also mentioned that a nurse named Yeshua, disguised as a peasant girl, entered captured villages to gather important German intelligence.</p>
<p>After Two Months of War, German Divisions are Aging and the Air Force Has Failed to Achieve Superiority</p>
<p>A military commentator stated that after 24 hours of heavy fighting on most of the Eastern Front yesterday, the German forces made slight progress between Kingisepp and Novgorod, but there were no startling or decisive results. The Soviet forces continue to fight tenaciously everywhere, and two months of continuous hard fighting seem not to have shaken their morale at all. The German forces are also quite fatigued after two months of fierce fighting. Whether their offensive has weakened as a result is known only to the German High Command and the German soldiers themselves. However, based on human nature, the morale of the average German infantryman, knowing that the enemy is mobile and skilled in combat, must be lower than before. While the effectiveness of the German organizational structure is widely recognized, the increasing distance between the front and the rear, coupled with increasing attrition, will inevitably have a greater impact. There are no new battles in the Smolensk and Kiev regions, and the German claims of gains in Ukraine are the same as those reported two days ago, namely that German forces have attacked the Soviet bridgehead on the north bank of the Dnieper River. Furthermore, although the German side claims to have established complete air superiority, Soviet aircraft, in addition to cooperating with the ground forces, are still able to attack Berlin and the Romanian oil fields, which is noteworthy. At the same time, the Soviet side is conducting a campaign to instruct the people on how to deal with gas and other chemical warfare, as Britain did in the early stages of the war. Many gas defense teams are conducting exercises, and trained speakers and air raid wardens are explaining methods of gas defense and self-protection to residents throughout Moscow. Newspaper editorials and other writings emphasize the possibility that the enemy is prepared to use any vile means to achieve victory, and the necessity for the Soviet people to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas, 21st: According to official announcements, a unit of German forces on the Ukrainian front, after attacking from Nikolaev, has now occupied Kherson, a city on the lower reaches of the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas, 21st: The German High Command has issued a war report stating that German forces on the northern front have occupied the three cities of Novgorod, Kingisepp, and Narva, which form the outer perimeter of Leningrad.</p>
<p>British Reports that the Large Dam on the Dnieper River Has Been Blown Up by Soviet Forces</p>
<p>London, United Press, 21st: The Daily Telegraph reports that, according to消息 from the Swedish capital, Budyonny's division, after communicating with Stalin by telephone, blew up the large dam on the Dnieper River, the site of a major industrial area in central Ukraine.</p>
<p>Berlin, United Press, 21st: The German official news agency stated yesterday that Soviet troops in Ukraine are attempting to遏阻 the German advance, and are launching counterattacks with tanks at several bridge堡垒 west of the Dnieper River. Reliable German sources say that fierce fighting is still ongoing in the far western parts of the Kiev and Korosten areas. The left flank of the German forces on the southern front is still being held up by strong堡垒 positions.</p>
<p>New York, United Press, 21st: Reports from Europe state that a new, intense battle is beginning on the German-Soviet front, stretching from Leningrad to Ukraine, as Hitler seeks to achieve his main objectives before the winter fighting comes to a standstill. According to sources in Berlin, Soviet troops in the Ukrainian region have suffered an "unprecedented disaster of destruction." The Germans expect that Marshal Budyonny's troops, now retreating to the east bank of the Dnieper River and struggling under Nazi artillery fire and air raids, will be destroyed. Meanwhile, Moscow also acknowledges that fierce fighting is developing on the defenses outside Leningrad. According to experts in London, this battle will be the largest bloodbath of the campaign. In other news, sources in the Swedish capital say that Marshal Voroshilov has concentrated 1.5 million troops at key points, and that the German attack has developed on three sides of Leningrad. Foreign observers estimate that although the Soviet troops have suffered significant losses in these two months, the main force remains untouched. They estimate that in another two months, winter will arrive, and the fighting along the 1,800-mile-long front will come to a complete standstill.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Analyzes the Soviet-German War Situation</h3>
<p>Germany Cannot Achieve its Goals in Europe by Force, and the Protracted War with the Soviet Union Has Left it in a Dilemma</p>
<p>Tokyo, Havas, 20th: The Asahi Shimbun recently published a report from its Berlin correspondent stating that Germany will ultimately find it difficult to achieve its goals in Europe by relying solely on its own strength. Therefore, "Germany must now redouble its efforts to win the hearts of the people in the occupied areas, as suppressing anti-German movements cannot be solved by military force alone. Hitler is probably aware of this. If he continues to insist on relying solely on force, the hope for peace will never be realized." Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, especially after the declaration of the Anglo-American alliance, the German people's understanding of the current European war has undergone a change. In essence, they had always believed that the current European war could be concluded quickly, but now they have come to realize that the European war is likely to be protracted. However, the German High Command is still seeking to end the war as quickly as possible, and, under the assumption that the Red Army is on the verge of collapse, has outlined various possible developments for the future. One is that after the end of the Soviet-German war, Britain and Germany will make peace. The second is that German forces will land in the British Isles, using the 40 million people of Britain as hostages for peace. In reality, with the war on the Eastern Front in a stalemate, it is difficult for Germany to land in Britain this year. Moreover, the Anglo-American joint declaration has made peace negotiations impossible. Therefore, Germany is in a dilemma. In the future, it must prepare for a long war.</p>
<h3>Belgian Minister of War Broadcasts That Germany Will Be Defeated</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 20th: Belgian Minister of War and Finance, Gutt, broadcast from London last night that Germany has lost 1.5 million soldiers, 800 artillery pieces, and 6,000 aircraft in the first seven weeks of its war against the Soviet Union. Germany will inevitably be defeated in its advance. Not only are British and Soviet bombers heavily bombing Germany, but on a scheduled date, Britain will send soldiers, artillery, and tanks to fight on the European continent. At that time, the Germans, having experienced the terror of being bombed and knowing the hatred of the oppressed people, will lose their confidence in their leaders and in themselves, as in 1918. The great air battle over Britain last September has already caused Germany to retreat, as Hitler cannot win unless he defeats Britain, just as we cannot win until our tanks march in formation down the Berlin boulevards.</p>
<h3>Rumors that Germany Cannot Withstand Bombing and Will Move its Capital South</h3>
<p>Several German Ministers Have Now Left Berlin</p>
<p>New York, United Press, 21st: The National Broadcasting Company heard yesterday from the Moscow wireless station that the German government will leave Berlin and move to a southern city because it cannot withstand the intense bombing. The Moscow wireless station stated that several German ministers have already left Berlin, with only a few staff members remaining. The plan for the complete relocation of the German government will be implemented in the autumn, as it is expected that the 機 will launch even more powerful bombing raids at that time.</p>
<h3>German Propaganda Minister Gives a Talk</h3>
<p>Madrid, Hentong News Agency, 21st: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels met yesterday with a Berlin-based correspondent from the Spanish "Informaciones" newspaper and gave a talk lasting one hour. He said, in brief: We must know that this war against the Soviet Union is a preliminary condition for the struggle against Britain. The war against the Soviet Union is absolutely necessary. Britain's night raids on German civilian residential areas will one day pay a heavy price. British propaganda often claims that Britain's resources can resist Germany. In fact, Britain can only rely on its island's economic structure and productive power. Materials shipped from the United States or its colonies will encounter German attacks. The activities of German submarines are now having a significant effect. Conversely, Germany's material supplies are all on the mainland, with short and safe routes. Regarding a question about Germany's preparedness, Goebbels replied that Germany has been systematically preparing for economic warfare for eight years. Today, almost all of Europe's resources are in German hands. In fact, Europe's economic structure is now working for the benefit of the Axis powers. Regarding the matter of the United States threatening Iberia and Latin America, Goebbels commented that if President Roosevelt adopts a policy of intervention, it is not for the sake of his friendly friend Churchill, but only for his own interests. Roosevelt is a representative of capitalism. If he were to threaten Iberia and Latin America in peacetime, it would be impossible. Only when these border defenses are weakened can he carry out his threats and seize military, economic, and political bases. If these countries cannot reject his propaganda threats, they will become American "colonies." Regarding the relationship between Germany and Spain, Goebbels replied that Spain has never had a conflict with Germany in its past history, so the Spanish people are among the friendliest people to Germany. The British propaganda policy is to stir up its people's morale, such as not announcing to its citizens the news of the German capture of Smolensk. If Germany were to imitate the British propaganda practices, it could spread alarming rumors, such as spreading the news that the ship carrying Roosevelt and Churchill for their sea talks was torpedoed, which could at least shock the world for a while, but it would inevitably lead to a major mistake later. A powerful country does not need to do this, unlike Britain, which often makes similar propaganda.</p>
<h3>German Control Forces Penetrate Deep into West Africa</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 21st: The Free French Headquarters stated that Dr. Krauss, head of the German mission to French West Africa's Senegal, arrived in Dakar from France on a private plane. The mission consists of hundreds of members. Its activities are no longer limited to Dakar and have expanded to the interior, with Germans being assigned to work alongside French officials in the interior. Therefore, it is generally believed that French officials will soon be replaced by Germans. The colonial officers and administrators are very resentful of this 合. Officials, both military and civilian, in French 　洛哥 are also concerned about the large concentration of troops in Spanish Morocco.</p>
<h3>British Plane Flies to France and Drops Off Artificial Legs</h3>
<p>For Use by Legless Pilot, Captain Bader</p>
<p>London, Havas, 20th: Famous British legless pilot, Air Force Captain Bader, previously parachuted out over northern France, breaking his artificial legs and being captured by the Germans. After negotiations by the International Red Cross, Germany has allowed a British aircraft to fly to France today and drop off a pair of artificial legs for Captain Bader to use.</p>
<h3>Iranian Government Takes Military Preparations</h3>
<p>And Asks Britain to Return Bahrain Island</p>
<p>A Border Area of Iran, Havas, 21st: The situation in Iran is tense, reaching a peak. Government authorities have taken various precautionary measures in the military sphere. At the same time, the diplomatic pressure exerted by Britain and the Soviet Union is also increasing. To fully understand the situation in Iran, one must first observe its political and military situation. The Iranian army began to modernize in 1928, hiring foreign military advisors, adding new equipment, and providing rigorous training. The national army has only nine帥, of which about ten divisions have been mechanized. There are also five cavalry brigades, an artillery regiment, and an air force with 200 aircraft, mostly old models. These troops are all loyal to the king. Therefore, if foreigners attempt to invade Iranian territory, they will inevitably encounter strong resistance, but due to limited strength, it is feared that this resistance will not be sustained. Politically, Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf is a British naval base, which is of great importance. The Iranian government has asked Britain to return the island. If this can become a reality, it will greatly benefit the country's prestige. Therefore, the question now is whether Britain considers it important to transport an expeditionary force through Iran to the Soviet Union, and is willing to return Bahrain Island to Iran.</p>
<p>New York, Havas, 21st: Reports from London state that Iran's reply regarding the British and Soviet requests for the Iranian government to expel thousands of German nationals has been unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Hentong News Agency, 21st: Turkish newspapers report that the German ambassador to Iran has issued an ultimatum to the Iranian government, stating that if Iran succumbs to British diplomatic pressure and expels German nationals, Germany will immediately sever diplomatic relations with Iran. This news has been denied by the Iranian ambassador to Turkey.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden Broadcasts to Turkey</h3>
<p>London, Havas, 20th: Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a broadcast speech to the Turkish people today, saying: "Five months ago, I visited your country and had sincere and frank talks with your President Inonu. Since then, there have been many severe changes internationally, but one thing remains certain: your country has an unshakable determination to defend its independence and resist aggression. Fortunately, your country has this determination and courage, which enables it to gain an important position in the Middle East. This was true in the past, it is true now, and it will be true in the future if you maintain this spirit. I wish the friendly country prosperity."</p>
<h3>Rumors that Germany and France Will Discuss Peace Terms</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 21st: The Independent French News Agency传维希官塲 that Vichy and Germany are discussing peace terms, and that Vichy will allow Germany to use French and French African naval and military bases under this peace agreement. Germany hopes to conclude an agreement with Vichy, or at least a preliminary agreement, in the shortest possible time. In return for borrowing the bases, Germany will withdraw some of its troops stationed in France, and those remaining will be considered allies, as with the troops stationed in Italy, rather than being treated as an occupied area. After the war, British territories in Africa, such as Nigeria and the Gold Coast, could be ceded to France and jointly developed by Germany and France. Vichy would cede the French provinces of Alsace and Finland to Germany, but France could receive some areas in northern Belgium. France would not have to cede land to Italy and could retain Tunis, while Italy would take Egypt as compensation for relinquishing Tunis. These negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>The Value of the French Currency Increases and the Exchange Rate Returns to Normal, but Prices Remain High and Do Not Fall</h3>
<p>Merchants are Inherently Greedy and Cannot Be Restrained</p>
<p>Citizens are Eager for the Authorities to Implement Controls</p>
<p>According to responsible sources in this city, when the exchange rate recently fell, many Chinese shop owners and those who hoarded goods to profit from the situation, being inherently greedy, drastically raised various prices, making them simply impossible to束. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office also admitted that although the value of the French currency has risen in recent days, various prices have not decreased slightly as a result.</p>
<p>Price Investigation Ended Long Ago</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about the Chinese newspapers' recent criticism of the SMC for the rising price of items such as coal briquettes, the official replied that those making such criticisms have failed to consider factors such as wage increases that contribute to the rising cost of living. The Price Investigation Office is now only engaged in compiling a weekly comparative table of basic prices, and the work of investigating general prices has ended some time ago. The SMC is no longer investigating the wholesale prices of goods or the daily fluctuations in prices.</p>
<p>Comparative Figures Obtained Through Inquiry</p>
<p>When the reporter asked how the SMC determines the figures in the weekly price comparison table, the official explained that general prices are based on market prices. If an item cannot be purchased on the market, then its price is inquired from general stores in the International Settlement. "General stores" refer to medium-sized stores, not large firms or small shops, but the selling prices reported by various stores are always different.</p>
<p>Chinese Side Expresses Disappointment</p>
<p>Chinese sources here have expressed disappointment that the SMC has stopped investigating general prices during this "emergency period," as the SMC's investigation of prices would give merchants the impression that their selling prices are subject to scrutiny by the authorities. This is also one of the reasons for the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Returns to Normal, but Prices Do Not Fall</p>
<p>When the exchange rate of the French currency fell, all prices increased. Now that the exchange rate has returned to normal, and is the same as before the fall, the prices have not decreased slightly. The excuse is nothing more than that they cannot replenish their stock at the old price. The reporter also asked the SMC Price Investigation Office about implementing price controls here. According to reports, the SMC believes that implementing this measure would require huge expenditures to hire many personnel to collect the necessary facts and figures in order to be effective. The exorbitant prices involve many factors such as shipping and exchange rates, which the SMC cannot control in a short period.</p>
<p>Increasing the Price of Foreign Rice is Truly Unwise</p>
<p>Rumors that many Chinese stores are selling bread that is short in weight are inconsistent with the SMC's findings. Bread is an important food, and the SMC is paying close attention to it. Chinese sources here have also criticized the SMC's increase in the price of foreign rice, saying that this action is truly unwise and has proven to stimulate shop owners to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Tofu Prices to Rise Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Tofu Association met and discussed the matter the day before yesterday, and decided to raise prices again starting on the 23rd of this month, with the minimum retail price being one 角. This will add to the burden on the lives of ordinary people, which is by no means insignificant. The new price list set by the industry lists the price per board as five 元. The retail price of tender tofu will be at least one 角 (currently only five 分), and the retail price of old tofu will be at least two 角 (currently only one 角). The price increases for tofu products listed in the new price list are also significant. Tofu skin will be four 角 per sheet, and fragrant tofu will be one 角 per piece. The price increases are about double. In the past, the industry would typically close for one day before a price increase to show its determination. This year, the industry association, fearing trouble, has persuaded them not to do so.</p>
<h3>Public Granary Siam Rice – Sale Begins Tomorrow</h3>
<p>46 Retailers Distributing, Price at 116 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Food Rice Public Granary Management Committee, a batch of Rangoon rice was processed in early July and sold to the Public Works Department (工部局) at a fair price. It was then distributed to various rice shops for retail sale at a price of 116 yuan per stone. Subsequently, it was decided to purchase another batch from Thailand, Burma, and other places to regulate the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai. Now, a batch of Siam No. 2 rice, totaling 400 tons, has been shipped to Shanghai. The committee believes that the Siam No. 2 rice is different in quality from the Rangoon rice of the Public Works Department’s fair-priced rice, and the quantity is only 400 tons. Therefore, it was decided not to sell it to the Public Works Department as before. Instead, it was decided to entrust 46 members of the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association to sell it at fair prices in their stores, totaling 3,734 bags. In addition, the committee also has 58,350 bags of Rangoon rice, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of September.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Far East Nationals Withdraw to Shanghai in Stages</h3>
<p>480 German, Italian, and Japanese Nationals Arrive Today from Manila by Ship</p>
<p>The French postal ship Général Joffre, which came to Shanghai via Saigon and Little Luzon, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 16th of this month, but was later changed to the 19th. Due to bad weather and fog at sea, the voyage was delayed. It was reported yesterday that it would be delayed until yesterday. It is now known that the postal ship did not arrive yesterday. According to sources at the company, it is expected to arrive this morning. It will not stay in Shanghai for long and will return to Vietnam soon.</p>
<p>Nationals of the Three Countries Withdraw from the Philippines to Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that 480 German, Italian, and Japanese nationals withdrawing from Manila have departed on the French postal ship Général Joffre and are expected to arrive here at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 22nd). The Général Joffre came from Saigon and Manila to Shanghai. French postal company personnel remained silent on the matter. However, it is learned that most of the German and Italian nationals on board the Général Joffre will disembark in Shanghai, while the 375 Japanese nationals will proceed to Japan via Shanghai.</p>
<p>Général Joffre Was Searched</p>
<p>The Général Joffre also carries approximately 5,000 bags of tribute rice to Shanghai and will be moored at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Passengers will disembark at the Customs Wharf. According to reports, when the Général Joffre docked in Manila, the U.S. High Commissioner's Office in the Philippines sent personnel to board the ship and search passengers' luggage for frozen securities.</p>
<p>Future Movements of the Japanese Nitta Maru</p>
<p>Personnel at the Japan Mail Steamship Co. here recently stated that they have not received any news regarding the Nitta Maru, which is currently docked in Japan, so they do not know whether the ship will resume its voyages to Shanghai. The Nitta Maru had previously called at Shanghai several weeks ago and carried away a large number of Japanese nationals. Due to the political situation, the ship has suspended its voyages to the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. Evacuation Ship Prepares to Sail to Japan</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, a postal ship from the U.S. President Lines is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of this month. It is reported that the U.S. authorities are currently engaged in serious negotiations with the Japanese regarding the evacuation of Japanese nationals residing in the United States. Once the ship arrives in Shanghai, if the negotiations are successful, it will sail to Japan to prepare for the evacuation of U.S. nationals residing in Japan. It is also learned that the President Lines office in Shanghai will refuse to sell first-class tickets for the Shanghai-Hong Kong route on this ship, as it is intended to be reserved for U.S. nationals traveling to Japan. As for the exact date of the ship's arrival in Shanghai, the company does not wish to disclose it for security reasons.</p>
<p>British Nationals in Japan Evacuate When Opportunity Arises</p>
<p>Walter Duranty, the Tokyo correspondent of the "North China Daily News", reported on the 20th that an official at the British Embassy here told reporters tonight that the British authorities are not currently taking any planned action to evacuate the remaining British nationals in Japan, nor have they planned this matter with the Japanese authorities. However, many British nationals wish to leave Japan when the opportunity arises. Although there are currently no British ships in Japanese ports, and no British ships are expected to arrive in Japan in the near future, British nationals can take Japanese ships to Shanghai and then travel to other places, apparently without any obstacles. However, the recent freezing order will naturally cause inconvenience, and the Japanese side has now implemented stricter regulations on the departure of foreign nationals from Japan.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals in the Northeast Begin to Evacuate</p>
<p>British and American nationals residing in various parts of the Northeast have been subjected to surveillance and obstruction by the Japanese authorities since the British and American governments froze funds. One hundred British and American nationals from Harbin have already begun their evacuation and are expected to arrive in Tanggu by train today. With the exception of a few who will transfer to trains to Tianjin and Beijing, the rest will await ships to Shanghai. This group of British and American nationals includes merchants, missionaries, and women and children, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>New U.S. Commercial Counselor Discusses Future Shanghai-U.S. Trade</h3>
<p>Not Restricted by Freezing Order, Legitimate Trade Can Continue as Usual</p>
<p>The English-language "Finance and Commerce" reported that Groves, the new U.S. Commercial Counselor who arrived in Shanghai last week, is succeeding Arnold in his vacancy. Mr. Groves is visiting Shanghai for the first time. A special representative of this newspaper went to call on him and was received by Mr. Groves. According to Mr. Groves, "Trade between the United States and Shanghai is unlikely to be affected for a long period of time. The amount of U.S. imports is also unlikely to be reduced by the regulations on trade and exchange announced in Washington on July 26." Mr. Groves then discussed the recent freezing order and stated his opinion that the U.S. authorities should have some regulations to allow trade between the United States and Shanghai, China, and other foreign countries to continue within a reasonable scope. He said that the U.S. must pay attention to the control of foreign trade and that U.S. exports to Shanghai must be for normal purposes. He believes that under strict control, U.S. supplies may not be abused with foreign exchange facilities. U.S. commercial banks must handle the business in order to continue legitimate imports. He continued, "As far as the authorities in Washington are concerned, applications for exports to Shanghai and other Far East ports must be obtained from the Export Control Administrator, General Maxwel. It is, of course, possible that the Ministry of Finance may refuse to provide financial facilities even if the Administration has issued export certificates. But in general, unless there is a major change in the Pacific situation, trade between the United States and Shanghai will not be severely affected." However, Mr. Groves' opinion is, of course, only in terms of financial aspects and does not include the lack of transportation ships. Therefore, Mr. Groves admitted that if the transportation problem continues to change, it is difficult to predict how much the quantity of U.S. exports to Shanghai will be in the coming months. When Mr. Groves discussed the general principles of trade, he said that normal trade relations have long ceased to exist since World War I in 1918. Every country has erected trade barriers to protect its own economy and resist the economy of its neighbors, which has greatly affected international trade. He said, "When peace comes again, I firmly believe that trade will no longer have this kind of shackle, goods will have more freedom of movement, and prosperity will come with peace."</p>
<h3>Four Banks' Office Drafts Measures for Applying for Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Import Bans Halt Exchange Settlements; Chief Customs Commissioner Releases Detailed List</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News learned yesterday from the Four Banks that the regulations on the prohibition of foreign exchange applications for prohibited import goods and the measures for applying for foreign exchange for necessities have been drafted by the Joint Office of the Four Banks and will be announced and implemented soon. All Chinese commercial banks licensed to deal in foreign exchange may apply to the Bank of China (中國銀行) and Bank of Communications (交通銀行) on behalf of merchants importing goods.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Applications Must Be Guaranteed</p>
<p>The measures for applying for foreign exchange for necessities have been drafted by the Four Banks. According to a reporter from New Voice News, applicants must have a valid guarantee and fill out an application form. The application form should state: (1) applicant, (2) purpose, tariff number, name of goods, country of origin, quantity or weight, value, port of departure and date, import location and transport area, (3) foreign exchange currency, amount, date required, exchange location, (4) documents, (5) remarks, applicant's signature, seal, date and place. After review and approval, the Bank of China or Bank of Communications will provide the exchange at the Shanghai exchange rate stipulated by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, namely £3 1/875 and $5.375. However, for those importing into the free zone, applications should be made to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee and provided at the statutory exchange rate after approval, namely £1 2 1/2 pence and $30. However, applicants must pay the balancing fee for the difference between the statutory exchange rate and the commercial exchange rate. The commercial exchange rate is quoted by the Bank of China and Bank of Communications at £4 1/2 pence and $7.50.</p>
<p>Detailed List of Prohibited Items</p>

Detailed measures have been drafted by the authorities of the Four Banks. As for the list of prohibited import goods, there are many rumors from the outside world. A reporter from New Voice News learned yesterday from the Office of the Chief Customs Commissioner that the prohibited import goods include luxury goods, consumables, and substitutes, totaling twelve categories, eighteen groups, and two hundred and thirty-four items. The detailed list is as follows: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sujia Railway Derailment, Number of Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>Two Dead, Twenty-Eight Injured; Japanese Say Due to Soil Erosion</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that a train from Shanghai at 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday derailed near Jiaxing on the Sujia Railway (蘇嘉路). The locomotive and four carriages derailed. It is reported that two people died and twenty-eight were injured.

The Japanese army and railway authorities immediately conducted an investigation, and train services were suspended until noon yesterday (the 20th) when repairs were completed and traffic resumed.</p>

If there is a storm, nineteen of the roads will be flooded. Otherwise, some roads will be submerged in water due to backflow from the sewers. According to the observatory records, the humidity in Shanghai is quite high, from 97% to 100% on the 19th and from 87% to 91% on the 20th, which has a significant impact on residents' health. Typhoid fever and other diseases have also taken the opportunity to revive. Residents should pay attention to their health.</p>
<h3>Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund Promotes Store Employee Reading Movement</h3>
<p>Store Clerks and Apprentices Can Apply; Application Forms Being Printed, Registration to Begin Within Days</p>
<p>All procedures for the current session of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund will be completed after all scholarships for major universities and specialized schools are distributed within days. According to the resolution of the Readers' Scholarship Fund Committee, the staff of this newspaper will immediately organize the application for scholarships for industrial and commercial employees, in order to fulfill the instructions of those who have enthusiastically donated funds, as well as the sincere requests from industrial and commercial employees. Yesterday, people from all walks of life continued to donate money to the scholarship fund. However, this newspaper has decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance of donations and has politely explained that it will be handled again at a fixed time. In addition, it has also been decided to distribute the scholarships for major universities and specialized schools earlier, starting on the 24th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Subsidies for Part-time Study</p>
<p>The Scholarship Fund Committee has received: (1) repeated letters from responsible persons of various manufacturers and firms to this newspaper requesting the committee to provide assistance to industrial and commercial employees for part-time study; (2) suggestions from scholarship donors to establish scholarships for industrial and commercial employees in addition to scholarships for students in major universities, middle schools, and primary schools; (3) letters from store clerks and apprentices expressing the pain of losing the opportunity to study and requesting assistance to help them with part-time study. After serious discussion, it was agreed that the suggestions of the donors and the desire of industrial and commercial employees to learn are commendable and should be given appropriate assistance. It was decided to allocate 5,000 yuan to handle this matter. The resolution was published in this newspaper on the 20th. Yesterday, many industrial and commercial employees sent letters inquiring about the measures, which shows their great concern. Application forms are currently being printed. Any industrial and commercial employee who intends to apply for a scholarship must first obtain a letter of recommendation or certificate from the manager of the service manufacturer or firm for review. Those who do not have this certificate or letter of recommendation will not be approved. It is hoped that all applicants will pay special attention to this point. If people from all walks of life have any opinions, please teach us so that we can achieve perfection.</p>
<p>List of Approved Free Places to Be Announced</p>
<p>The list of approved scholarship recipients for major universities and middle schools will be fully published today. In addition, the various applicants who the committee believes can be assisted but need to be reviewed and supplement documents, as well as the free students from the four newly built schools, the Second New School, Yuhua, Zhengzhong Girls' High School, and Jingzhi Girls' High School, will be reviewed and announced on the 24th. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>Scholarships to Be Issued One Day Earlier</p>
<p>Many students applying for scholarships have sent letters requesting early issuance due to the imminent deadline for paying tuition fees. The staff of this newspaper are currently expediting the procedures and have decided to issue the scholarships earlier, starting at 9:30 a.m. on the 24th (Sunday). However, the schools have long stipulated that banks and other institutions collect tuition fees on behalf of the schools. Some applicants may not be able to pay on time due to the short time. It is requested that the school authorities appreciate that these students are poor and studying hard and have been fortunate enough to receive sympathy from the community to continue their studies. Please make an exception and allow them to pay their tuition at the school. Several school authorities have already expressed their willingness to do so, and it is believed that other school authorities will also be able to understand.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations Have Not Slackened</p>
<p>Regarding the continued intention of people from all walks of life, which is admirable, this newspaper stated in yesterday's newspaper that the acceptance of donations would be closed on the 20th in order to streamline procedures. However, this morning, enthusiastic scholarship supporters brought more than 800 yuan and asked to be included. This newspaper politely explained this, and they understood. The staff felt very sorry for the hard work. Later, at dusk, another enthusiastic reader who donated 200 yuan repeatedly stated their approval of the staff's service and firmly refused to take back the money they intended to donate. The staff reluctantly accepted it with shame and gratitude and will publish it in this newspaper at the end of the month together with the donations from the monthly donors to show our credibility. Therefore, the staff decided to express their gratitude to all sectors of society for their enthusiastic donations, on the one hand, to show their concern for the students, and, on the other hand, to streamline the scholarship procedures of this newspaper. All those who continue to donate after the deadline of this period will be announced monthly at the end of the month, in addition to the official receipt issued by this newspaper at the time. Please understand.</p>
<h3>Approved List</h3>
<p>The list of approved places for the major universities and middle schools group by the Scholarship Fund Committee of this newspaper has been fully published today. Those who have not taken the examination or do not know which school they have been admitted to, as well as other applicants who have the same situation, are requested to notify us by letter immediately and must attach proof.

<h3>Gonghexiang Wharf Workers' Arrest Conflict</h3>
<p>Strike Causes Four Workers Injured, One Dead; Two Western Police Officers on Scene Also Slightly Injured</p>
<p>Over two hundred temporary workers at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Hongkou East Broadway Road (虹口東百老匯路), managed by Jardine Matheson, elected representatives to request higher wages and allowances from management due to the rising cost of living and the difficulty of making ends meet. The request was denied, and the workers went on strike on the day.</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m. yesterday, the management sent representatives to negotiate with the workers' representatives. The management had previously telephoned the police station requesting police to maintain order. However, all the temporary workers expressed strong dissatisfaction. The negotiations were again unsuccessful, resulting in a conflict between all the workers and the management. Some workers even pulled out iron bars and bricks and threw them at the management representatives, and the situation was very serious for a time. The police officers on the scene tried their best to suppress the violence and maintain order, but to no avail. The police officers then fired several shots, wounding five workers. One of them was shot in a vital area and died on the spot. Two Western police officers were also injured, one named Open, the other Klabbe. Afterwards, the police station sent a large number of police officers to investigate. The four injured workers were sent to Shanghai East Sanatorium for treatment, and the body of the dead worker was sent to the coroner's office for examination. The two Western police officers were sent to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Pacific Hurricane to Strike Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>If Wind Direction Does Not Change, Shanghai Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Since the heavy rain the day before yesterday, the weather in Shanghai has turned cooler, and the sky has been cloudy and sunny. Yesterday, we learned from the Xujiahui Observatory that a new hurricane has formed near the Ryukyu Islands and is moving rapidly north and north-northwest. As of 2 p.m. yesterday, the center of the hurricane had reached 126.30 degrees east longitude and 27 degrees north latitude. If the hurricane continues on this course, Shanghai will feel its threat on the morning of. However, the hurricane is weaker than the previous one. The Jianghai Customs (江海關) and others are closely monitoring it. However, Shanghai seemed to have felt the effects of the hurricane's outer bands yesterday. A bungalow opposite Hollywood Road (愚國路) collapsed after being invaded by rain and blown by the wind, injuring Mao Zhao (44 years old), Mao Jinbao (11 years old), and Mao Faqing (2 years old), a mother and her two children who lived in the house. They were taken to the Tongren Second Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The Shanghai Maritime Customs hoisted a red and black light on the rooftop clock tower at 8:15 p.m. yesterday to warn ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions against hurricane strikes. It is reported that the hurricane has entered the Taiwan Strait. It is expected that the hurricane's distance from Shanghai will be such that the city may be hit this afternoon. However, according to the aforementioned wind direction, the city can still avoid being hit. However, the wind direction changes at any time, and it is difficult to predict whether the city will be hit by the hurricane.</p>
<h3>Qunxian Villa Tenants Suffer Oppression from Landlords</h3>
<p>All tenants of Qunxian Villa (羣賢別墅) on Avenue du Père Huc (金神父路) are on indefinite leases and have been getting along for many years. The rent has been increased three times. Last spring, the landlord had a whimsical idea and suddenly entrusted the lease to MacDillan &amp; Co. Within a few days, they sent a letter proposing another rent increase. The tenants, in order to make the best of a bad situation, reluctantly increased the rent by 20%, and they would take care of the water bill themselves. It was stipulated in writing that the rent would not be increased again within a year and a half. Unexpectedly, before the ink was dry, the company broke its promise this spring and sent a letter proposing another 50% rent increase and advertised the villas for sale by building. All the tenants believe that finding a house is extremely difficult and also published a notice to the purchasers, stating that the premises are not vacant and that strong-arm tactics should not be used to take it back for personal use, and that attention should be paid to the strict provisions of Article 425 of the Civil Code. Recently, a group of people calling themselves new owners have disregarded social realities and have launched a group lawsuit. The first to suffer was the tenant at No. 27 of this lane, who was ordered to move out. Once this precedent is set, landlords who own houses will follow suit, and the city's 5 million residents will inevitably be in danger. In addition to petitioning the judicial administration authorities for relief, the association appeals to enlightened people from all walks of life for effective assistance.</p>
<h3>葆大參號　清晨送到炸彈</h3>
<p>Outwardly wrapped as a "Liangyou Pictorial" and instructed to be given to the manager, followed by a telephone call inquiring, startling the shop assistants.</p>
<p>At the Baoda Ginseng Shop, number 503 on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, west of the Great World, at 7:15 yesterday morning, just after opening for business, a man dressed in short clothes resembling a worker arrived with a package wrapped in Liangyou Pictorial paper. He handed it to Xia Yizuo, the old clerk, instructing him to give it to the manager, Ling Shoupeng, a native of Ningbo. He then turned and left. Xia placed the package on the counter, paying it no mind. Shortly after, a student, Yang Xiaoxian, saw the package on the counter and, recognizing it as the Liangyou Pictorial, was overjoyed and prepared to open it to read. Suddenly, the telephone rang. Another employee, Tong Ligeng, a native of Ningbo, answered. The caller did not identify himself or his location, only saying that he had sent a Liangyou Pictorial to Mr. Ling and asking if it had been received. Tong replied that Mr. Ling had not yet arrived but would be there in about an hour. Before Tong could hang up, another employee, Chen Fengyang, discovered that the package contained a small hand grenade. At this point, all the employees in the shop, big and small, were terrified and rushed away from the danger, completely panicked. Fortunately, although the bomb had been opened and moved, it did not explode. They immediately telephoned the Avenue Joffre police station, which in turn reported to the Louzawei General Police Station. Central and foreign detectives were dispatched to investigate. The bomb was taken back to the police station for disposal, and the manager was summoned for questioning to determine if he had received any threatening letters or if there had been any other incidents. The police also sent detectives to find the person who delivered the bomb, vowing to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>天氣報告</h3>
<p>Weather Report</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that in Shandong Province, the weather would change from clear to cloudy with strong northeasterly winds and occasional showers. Here, the sky would be overcast with occasional showers and a shift to strong northeasterly winds. In the East China Sea, there would be cyclones and sudden rainstorms with considerable force due to a strong hurricane moving north-northwest. At 2:00 PM, the hurricane's center was located at 27 degrees north latitude, 126.30 degrees east longitude, within 60 miles. The wind direction was north-northwest with strong force. Also, within the 24 hours prior to 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 82.8 degrees and the lowest was 75.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 95.9 degrees and the lowest was 77.7 degrees.</p>
<h3>金融　申請結欵所得無幾　進口商重向黑市追求</h3>
<p>Finance: Importers Return to the Black Market After Receiving Little from Approved Exchange Requests</p>
<p>美匯昨又緊至四元六二五</p>
<p>The U.S. Dollar Tightens Again to $4.625 Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's posted rates. U.S. dollars on small counters remained at $5.3125. Black market U.S. dollars were effectively priceless. The U.S. dollar trended towards tightening again, with Chinese speculators slightly increasing their long positions, while British and Japanese firms showed considerable appetite. The morning price tightened from $4.875 to $4.75. In the afternoon, the British-American Tobacco Company and cotton merchants had substantial settlement needs. It was also rumored that British and American firms had a meeting and, given the small amount of approved exchange requests, were considering maintaining the black market. American firms and other banks repeatedly raised prices for supply. Therefore, amidst the chaos, the price of British gold broke the previous tight price of 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 4 and 3/8 pence from the 11th of this month, reaching 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 1 and 1/8 pence. The U.S. dollar also approached the $4.75 mark from that day, reaching a new tight price of $4.625. Both currencies tightened considerably, and trading became brisk.</p>
<p>進口商結款益繁</p>
<p>Importers' Settlement Needs Increase</p>
<p>Since the recent slight decrease in the telegraphic transfer of silver from London, the remaining exchanges and British and American silver remained unchanged. Various foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar against Shanghai were up slightly by 2.4 cents, the rest were flat. The central bank's posted rates were all flat. The morning opening bank selling prices on the domestic market were: large spot central gold, 2 pounds, 9 shillings, 6 and 7/8 pence; U.S. dollars, $4.84375. Chinese speculators continued to sell U.S. dollars for August delivery at $4.875. HSBC's posted rates remained flat. After deducting the silver equalization tax of 24.25%, British and Japanese firms successively absorbed August dollars at $4.875 and $4.84375. The market trended towards tightening, especially at midday. Foreign firms aggressively bought August dollars at $4.8125, causing the afternoon closing price for U.S. dollars to be only $4.78125. Some were settled at only $4.75. British gold was 2 pounds, 9 shillings, 3 and 7/8 pence, still short of a formal market price. In the afternoon, importers' needs for settling payments for tobacco and fireworks increased, and they further bought August dollars at $4.75 and $4.6875. The pace of tightening was even sharper. The willingness of American and other foreign banks to supply was even weaker. Therefore, at the 3:30 PM closing, the spot U.S. dollar price for September settlement was $4.625 (some were settled at only $4.59375), and British gold followed, tightening to 2 pounds, 8 shillings, 1 and 1/8 pence. Compared to the previous day's noon closing, the U.S. dollar tightened by 2.1875, and British gold tightened by 1.5625.</p>
<p>香港匯市無榮辱</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Without Gains or Losses</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st (Thursday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no gains or losses for any currency.</p>
<p>天津英匯獨鬆疲</p>
<p>Tianjin Sterling Exchange Alone Weakens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 21st (Thursday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate weakened by 0.03125 to 3 pounds, 2 shillings, 8 and 1/8 pence. The New York exchange rate remained unchanged, still opening at $5.625. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 50 cents to $87.50. The black market price for joint banknotes remained unchanged at $54.75.</p>
<h3>現金一漲三百元</h3>
<p>Cash Spikes by $300</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash gold saw an initial surge followed by a decline, then a renewed increase. After breaking the $6,800 mark, it saw renewed selling. Although the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate remained at $5.3125, it was reported that legitimate commercial settlements from Monday had not yet been received. Importers aggressively sought dollars on the black market, leading to a sharp tightening of foreign exchange. The weary sentiment among various parties inevitably shifted to firmness. Short covering was more urgent than selling. Hong Kong and Shanghai gangs aggressively bought, causing the daily price to rise from $6,750 in the morning to $6,875 on the board in the afternoon, eventually reversing and closing up $28. Total trading volume was 150,000 taels. The forward spread (August rolling into September) saw buyers pay sellers from $90 to as high as $120. The rising trend in cash intensified, reaching unprecedented peaks. In the morning, Tong Kangyong sold 130 taels to Xiang Xingyong at $9,100. Shi He and Shun Yuan each sold 20 taels to De Cheng at $9,210. Shun Yuan then sold 50 taels to the silversmiths' guild at $9,250, and another 60 taels to Tian Yuan at $9,260. Xiang Xingyong sold 10 taels to De Da at $9,300. Shun Yuan sold 10 taels to Cheng Ji at $9,220. In the afternoon, Shun Yuan sold 50 taels to Xiang He at $9,250. Tian Yuan sold 140 taels to Gong He, Da Cheng Yong, Xin Yuan, and De Cheng at $9,260. Yi Da and Tong Kangyong each sold 10 taels to He Sheng at $9,300. This was a huge surge of $300 from the previous day's price. Jewelry gold also rose by $20 to a new high of $990.</p>
<p>期貨暫做了結交易</p>
<p>Futures Trading Temporarily Suspended for Closing Transactions</p>
<p>Since this morning, each bar (10 taels) has been subject to the exchange's recommendation, following yesterday afternoon's meeting, to temporarily suspend closing transactions. Given the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate of $5.3125, it was feared that it would not be changed, and the market sentiment inevitably softened. Supply was less than demand, causing the 9:05 AM opening price to be $6,750, $82 lower than the previous day's closing price. Short sellers took advantage of the low price to cover their positions. Tian Yuan and Chi Da aggressively bought, and Jin Hao and Cheng Ji further increased their buying. The price then rose by $40 to $6,790. Yi Da and Shen Ji sold, causing a retreat to $6,770. Later, due to the tightening of the black market U.S. dollar, the selling trend weakened, and Yi Yuan absorbed supply, raising the price to $6,780. The noon closing price was $6,776, and after the closing, it was $6,780. In the afternoon, sentiment was quite good. The 2:00 PM opening price immediately rose to the $6,800 level. It then declined slightly to $6,785. Due to the sharp tightening of the black market foreign exchange, He Sheng, Cheng Ji, De Cheng, Yi Da, and others aggressively absorbed supply, causing a rise of $90, reaching $6,875, where Xiang Xing Yong and retail investors sold. The price retreated to $6,845. Da Feng and Yi Da aggressively bought, and at the 3:30 PM closing, the price was $6,860, $28 higher than the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the black market September U.S. dollar settlement price of $4.625, the price was $7,529, an increase of $169. If calculated based on the HSBC small counter U.S. dollar rate of $5.3125, the price was $6,555, an increase of $305. There was a difference of $125 on the day. After the closing, the price was $6,870. The market selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand gold must be $9,300, with a $200 reduction for buying back. The current marked price is neither priced nor marketable.</p>
<p>飾金掛九百五十元</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Quoted at $950</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang rose by $10 at 10:30 AM, and again by $10 at 11:30 AM, reaching $950 (with a $40 reduction for buying back), a total increase of $20.</p>
<h3>外幣一致升騰</h3>
<p>Foreign Currencies Rise Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw continued soaring prices in the cash market. British and American gold pounds also continued to rise by $10. There was strong demand for British gold drafts, and market prices surged by $3. U.S. dollar drafts opened at $1,930. After opening, Ying Tai, Dong Sheng Heng, Zhen He, Xie Feng, and others bought, raising the price to $52. The noon closing price was $50. The afternoon opening price was $55. Xie Tai, Hui Feng, Xiang Yuan Yong, Zhi Cheng, Li Ji, and others bought, raising the price to $82. Yong He, Zhen He, Xie Feng, and others sold, retreating to a closing price of $1,974, up $10 from the previous day. The transaction volume was $800,000. Spot prices continued to soar to $22.70. Hong Kong drafts trended steadily, and market prices remained flat. Japanese and Korean gold drafts saw frequent sharp increases. The former rose to $2.52, and the latter rose to $1.91. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, Robbie, and Canadian drafts also trended upward.</p>
<h3>油市　油儈毫不放鬆　狂抬油價</h3>
<p>Oil Market: Oil Merchants Refuse to Relent, Frantically Raising Oil Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, speculative buying of cooking oil suddenly surged again. The general rice weevils and oil merchants colluded, acting recklessly, causing the prices of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil to be raised, rising step by step, increasing by as much as $10. Black market prices for raw soybean oil were also strong. The overall market selling price of Qing oil from Da You Factory was $199 to $204 for over 1,000 dans. Also, 700 dans of rapeseed oil were priced at $208 to $210. Rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory was priced at $200 to $208.50 for 1,500 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Yoshida Factory was priced at $198 to $100 for 150 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Lide Factory was priced at $92 to $101.50 for 100 barrels. Rapeseed oil from the Taishan Factory was priced at $194 to $100 for 100 barrels.</p>
<p>In addition, 560 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>糧食　小絞跌至公賣價下</h3>
<p>Grain: Small-Sized Imported Rice Falls Below the Government Selling Price</p>
<p>只須外匯有供給更無問題</p>
<p>No Problems as Long as Foreign Exchange is Supplied</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially declined, then stabilized, and market prices saw another drop of $2-3. This was because there was a sufficient inventory of foreign rice, and shipments were continuously arriving at the port. The market had already shown a downward trend. Recently, with reliance on the supply of foreign exchange, ample vessels, and lower freight rates, costs could be reduced. Also, telegrams from the producing areas indicated that local market prices were declining. Therefore, at present, orders could be placed in large quantities as long as foreign exchange was available for settlement. As a result, sentiment weakened further. In the early market, in addition to Heyi soliciting sales, Shen Ji also dumped 8-900 tons of small-sized "Ganwu" rice arriving in five days at a price of only $148-9. The spot market price for the original bagged small-sized imported rice immediately fell to $146, and $139.50 for 20% rice, but there was a lack of large buyers. Domestic rice also trended downward. Small-sized rice from the Xiaowen market fell to $120, lower than the fair selling price. Other types of rice all showed a downward trend. However, after the price fell slightly, it was absorbed by various hoarders who took advantage of the small decline. Also, rumors spread that foreign exchange applications were difficult, so the afternoon market saw a slight rebound. The total transaction volume for the day was reportedly 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Regarding the previously reported shipment of 7,000 bags of foreign rice from Shanghai to Tianjin on the Taikoo Company's "Ganzhou" vessel, it is now learned that the vessel will depart today, carrying only 5,000 bags of foreign rice to Qingdao, not Tianjin. However, the original vessel still has a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong bound for Yantai and Tianjin. The entire vessel is filled with foreign rice and no miscellaneous goods. (Zu)</p>
<p>Due to the heavy rains in the past two days, which turned the roads into flooded areas, the majority of sources for thick and thin japonica domestic rice were obstructed, and arrivals were scarce. The existing market inventory had also been depleted after continuous selling. Therefore, holders of the remaining inventory considered it a rare commodity and were unwilling to sell it rashly. Whenever inquiries were made, prices were repeatedly raised, and general customers, eager to meet their needs, had no choice but to yield. Therefore, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice rose by $2-3. Early rice from Kai Nan Port was $153-4, then $150. Specially selected japonica rice in original bags from Wuxi was $155, with the overall market price at $150 and substandard goods at $145-6. New japonica rice from Pudong also rose in response to this environment, opening at $158-9.</p>
<p>With the arrival of autumn, general transporters of glutinous rice have begun to receive shipments from the producing areas they had ordered in advance. These shipments have gradually arrived at the port and are now available in the market, boosting market activity. At the same time, the sales volume is not as sluggish as in the past, with both retail sales to food vendors and wholesale transactions with restaurants and wine merchants being more active. Therefore, the overall market situation remains balanced in terms of supply and demand, and prices have not seen significant gains or losses. Hong Kong white glutinous rice continues to open at $130, settling at $125. Glutinous rice ranges from $117 to $114. Domestic glutinous rice is $133-4.</p>
<h3>粉市步軟</h3>
<p>Flour Market Gradually Softens</p>
<p>新囤觀望…舊多求脫</p>
<p>New Stockpiles Watch… Old Stockpiles Seek to Exit</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for imported flour saw a gradual softening. According to actual sales in this district, the amount is sufficient for daily use because the factory's capacity is not enough, which is not bad, and there is also some turnover for re-export, so the market is not too loose. However, with the availability of foreign exchange for importing foreign flour and rumors of new transactions being finalized, sentiment inevitably weakened amid continuous arrivals. New stockpiles watched, and old stockpiles sought to exit, causing market prices to gradually soften. Jinlong flour from the Puxi warehouse was priced at $33.15 to $33, Cannonball flour at $34.45 to $34.05, Banana flour at $33.70, and Five Swallow flour at $33.90, all $0.02-0.03 lower than before. The total transaction volume was less than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Trading remained sluggish. Due to the limited arrivals in the vicinity, only Japanese factories made slight purchases, while Chinese factories found it difficult to buy. The factories' purchase prices remained unchanged, and market trading remained at a standstill.</p>
<h3>紗花　又說藏棉不如囤紗　論活動仍要推期紗</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton: Some Say Stockpiling Yarn is Better Than Storing Cotton; Forward Yarn Still Drives Activity</p>
<p>The yarn market trended towards a cyclical path. However, sentiment towards factory orders from Double Horse Mill was largely bearish, resulting in a decline in recent transactions and a lack of strong elasticity in the market. Although the volume of spot yarn transactions was not as high as before, market prices remained relatively stable. 32-count and 42-count yarn remained consistently firm, and 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn also showed an upward trend. Only factory orders were mediocre. However, some were still being absorbed, as the cost of raw materials had increased the factory's costs. There was discussion in the market that stockpiling yarn was better than storing cotton. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,683, the low price was $1,658, and the closing price was $1,672. The market was closed in the afternoon. It was heard that prices for yarn and cloth on the exchange were rising across the board, which boosted sentiment. It was unknown if there were other "bullish drivers." Some said that the marked price had risen seven times again. In addition, the continuous shipments of yarn to Hong Kong continued. Today, there were 1,630 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening price of Double Horse yarn in the morning showed a softening trend, as most expected a pullback, so there was a lack of enthusiasm among buyers, and transactions were not as active as in the past. The initial price was $1,660, which soon fell to $1,658. Later, profit-takers bought back and new buyers emerged, and at the same time, the second session on the exchange rebounded, so the situation followed and rose, gradually rising to $1,683. However, the market predicted that it would be difficult to break the $1,700 mark for the time being. As prices improved slightly, short selling returned. At the same time, actual transactions were sluggish, and the price softened again to a closing price of $1,672, down $3 from the previous day. However, selling pressure in the market was not strong. The transaction volume for half a day was 6,158 bales.</p>
<p>The market trend for Double Horse gold forward yarn was firm and strong, rising again. The morning opening started with higher U.S. cotton prices, while factory orders showed a downward trend. However, forward yarn, due to the large drop from yesterday, suddenly attracted the interest of many parties. The closure of gold market trading also enhanced the potential of many buyers. September futures opened at $1,575, up $4.50. Although it once fell to $1,568, it quickly rebounded. Later, October futures opened at $1,590, up $7.50. November futures opened at $1,606. After the opening, trading tightened, and although trading was not active, prices soared under the pull of many parties. Therefore, the noon closing price for September futures was $1,580, October futures was $1,593.50, and November futures was $1,614, with each near and far month up $9.50 to $11. The transaction volume for the morning session was 7,360 bales. In the afternoon, there was no market for factory orders, and forward yarn rose even more strongly. The rebound in the blue and gold market made many parties even more eager to absorb supply. It was said that speculators favored this market because the fluctuations in other markets were smaller, so buying sentiment was strong, creating a situation of rising prices. Therefore, September futures reached a high of $1,592, October futures reached a high of $1,612.50, and November futures reached a high of $1,635. After some floating positions were slightly released, prices softened slightly. As a result, September futures closed at $1,591, up $20.05, October futures closed at $1,612, up $20.50, and November futures closed at $1,633, up $27 from the opening. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,540 bales, down 1,330 bales from the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net posted prices).</p>
<p>The management of materials in textile factories is often difficult due to the large variety of items. The biggest reason for this is the lack of proper classification. To simplify and standardize the management of materials in textile factories, Mr. Hu plans to compile a national textile factory material statistics report. To solicit cooperation from various textile factories, machine factories, and hardware stores, anyone with various catalogs or other materials to supply can send communications to "Mr. Hu Xishan, 74 West Great Road, Shanghai."</p>
<h3>現棉索價過高　外棉定貨大旺</h3>
<p>Current Cotton Prices Too High; Orders for Foreign Cotton Are Very Strong</p>
<p>定價廉於現貨七八十元</p>
<p>Prices are $70-80 Cheaper Than Spot Prices</p>
<p>The spot cotton market in Shanghai is active, firm, and strong. This is because foreign cotton markets are trending upward, and general speculators are eager to buy. At the same time, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the impact of limited supply, the foreign cotton market in this city is in an unbreakable state of firmness. For the past two weeks, the spot market has remained firm, and at the same time, the majority of yarn factories and colleagues have entrusted foreign cotton firms with the intention of directly ordering Brazilian or American cotton. Although the procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, the prices are very cheap, with a difference of $70-80 from the spot market price, which is why general cotton firms are happy to finalize orders. For example, the spot price of American middling cotton is about $670, but if ordering goods arriving in Shanghai in September and October, the price is still below $600. Therefore, the lively transaction activity of various cotton firms in the past ten days has exceeded the excitement of any spot market. The total daily transaction volume is over 1,400-500 bales. It is expected that the future of the cotton market will be historically active due to the consistent bullish sentiment among all parties.</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is generally strong, and the rebound in foreign cotton has further strengthened sentiment. However, prices are too high, and transaction volume has greatly decreased. However, holders of goods have a deep-seated belief in holding them firmly.</p>
<h3>糖市　雙重壓力相乘　期糖一度見新高價</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Double Pressure Multiplies; Sugar Futures Once Saw New High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the delay in the arrival of the Dutch vessel and the purchase by Japanese merchants, so hoarders had more opportunities to take advantage of, resulting in a crazy upward trend. For example, the September 10 futures contract once saw an unprecedented high of $141, and the closing price retreated slightly, but still had to rise by more than $10, with a resolution of $6-7-8. The company's futures for coarse white sugar for delivery at the end of August opened at $127, then rose to $28.60, $29.50, and tightened to $130 in the afternoon, reaching a high of $38.50, closing at $35, up $11.60. The September 10 futures contract was $128.50, $30.90, $31.50, and reached a maximum price of $41 in the afternoon, then fell back to $35.20, closing at $36.60, up $11.20. The association's quoted prices for spot coarse white sugar arriving in July were $128.50, $31.50, and $35.20 in the afternoon, up $7.70. Six-piece shares were $127 to $30, and $35 in the afternoon, up $8.50. Dutch red KD mark was $120, TN mark was $117, and $122 in the afternoon. KD mark was $125, up $10. The total transaction volume was more than 83,000 bags of spot sugar and more than 70 bags of futures. Hong Kong coarse white sugar was $122, and $28 in the afternoon. Taikoo white B mark was $158, and $162 in the afternoon, up $7. DY mark was $140, HX mark was $132, and $35 in the afternoon, up $6.</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑木耳步高</h3>
<p>North-South Goods: Black Fungus Rises</p>
<p>Black fungus and mushrooms are products of the same origin, and their prices were once on par. However, due to the scarcity of mushroom arrivals and inventories in recent times, prices have repeatedly risen, leaving black fungus far behind. Recently, due to a lack of supply, black fungus has also seen a slight increase in price. Yesterday, the price of slightly higher-quality black fungus reached $980, an increase of more than $200.</p>

<h3>Academic Competition for Students Above Junior College Level Successfully Concluded in Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>A total of 473 participants from 20 institutions</p>
<p>In order to cultivate a scholarly research atmosphere among students above the junior college level and to improve their academic standards, the Ministry of Education specially organized a national academic competition, divided into preliminary and final rounds. The preliminary rounds were handled by the schools themselves, while the final rounds were organized by region. This year marked the second session. Due to environmental factors, the preparations for the Shanghai region were not publicly disclosed. However, as the event has now concluded, a reporter from the Dahua News Agency inquired with the educational administration regarding the process. They were informed that the Ministry of Education sent senior officials to oversee the final round in Shanghai and organized a Final Examination Committee responsible for its execution. After deliberation, the committee decided that each school should submit a roster and photos of participating students. The examination papers were prepared and sent to each institution, which then assigned secret codes to the students, affixed official seals, and returned the papers. Since the secret codes could not be the same as the seat numbers, the original schools were used as the examination venues. During the examinations, in addition to faculty members appointed by the schools to invigilate and assist, the committee also hired external personnel from other schools to supervise. Subsequently, the examination topics issued by the Ministry were administered on August 12th and 13th, divided into categories A and B. Category A included Chinese, English, German, French, and Mathematics, with first-year students selecting one to three subjects from the list. Category B was divided into subjects for Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Teachers, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, totaling 98 types. For subjects with similar content, second-year students (and sixth-year medical students) were allowed to participate. In total, 20 institutions participated, with 473 students taking 666 examination papers. The process went very well. As for category C, which involved the graduation thesis competition for graduating students, the institutions have also submitted their theses. The committee is currently forwarding the examination papers and theses to the Ministry of Education for evaluation. The results will be compiled and announced. Overall, the students from various institutions actively participated in the competition, and the faculty members carefully managed the process, resulting in a successful outcome.

<h3>YMCA to Organize Economic Cafeteria for Students</h3>
<p>Located in the Chinese Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Student Relief Association, under the auspices of the Chinese Christian YMCA, in addition to providing economic assistance to underprivileged students this year, will also establish an economic cafeteria for students. According to Yang Huaiseng, the person in charge of preparations, the economic cafeteria has been decided to be located at the former site of the Chinese Restaurant of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. It is currently under renovation because renting a space elsewhere would significantly increase expenses. Using the YMCA's facility will help reduce costs. The price of meals in the future will be kept as low as possible, as the original intention of establishing the economic cafeteria is to help underprivileged students.</p>
<h3>Football Season Arrives, Shanghai Chinese Football Association to Hold Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Meeting scheduled for next month on the 11th at the Engineers Association to elect officers and approve the list of joining teams</p>
<p>As autumn arrives, so does the football season. The annual report of the Shanghai Westerners Football Association was released yesterday. An announcement was also issued stating that the association will hold its annual meeting at 5:15 PM on the 11th of next month at the Shanghai Engineers Association at 220 Sichuan Road. The agenda is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Announcement of the Secretary's previous report and the Treasurer's financial report.</p>
<p>(2) Election of the Association's officers for 1941-1942.</p>
<p>(3) Announcement of the list of teams joining the association for 1941-1942.</p>
<p>(4) Other business.</p>
<p>Content of the Report</p>
<p>The annual report released yesterday detailed the Association's activities over the past year, including the entire competition process and the results of all cup and league matches. The report also mentioned teams and players who were warned or punished, as well as the Yiyuan incident and other disputes. The report deemed the unfortunate incident of the previous session to be caused by a portion of the audience lacking knowledge of the rules and the actions of the players, resulting in a loss of 9,605.60 yuan for Yiyuan, not including the loss from the suspension of dog racing that evening. Last session, two charity matches were held: the November 12, 1940, Huai De Cup match between Donghua and Laker, which ended in a 2-2 draw, raised 19,119.94 yuan, all of which was donated to the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute; and the January 2, 1941, McLane Engineer's Cup match, where the Western United team defeated the Chinese United team 5-2, raised 18,650 yuan, which was divided equally between Chinese and Western charities. The Association also passed a resolution at a special meeting on March 19 of this year to donate 15,000 yuan to Chinese and Western charities.</p>

Veteran Wen Jingling defeated 220-yard champion He Jin in the first group, and Jia Jun won first place in the second group with a time of 5 minutes and 47 seconds, just a few seconds off the highest record set by Yu in 1936, which is commendable.

<h3>The Scenery of the City of Water</h3>
<p>— Fang Yang</p>
<p>No threat, only novelty!</p>
<p>Heavens, covered with gray clouds.</p>
<p>The endless rain, like tears, never ceases to flow.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been transitioning through these days of sorrowful clouds and bitter rain.</p>
<p>The "riverbed" of the Huangpu River has risen three feet, and when the tide comes in, it surges onto the land!</p>
<p>Shanghai has become a city of water. In the near future, perhaps it can surpass Venice's "City of Water" and stand shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>The roads are all submerged in water. The yellow water from the Huangpu flows through the sewers onto the ground, creating black, smelly waves. People wade through it, and surely the "epidemic hospital" will "triple its profits."</p>
<p>Trams, cars, and buses have all become "ferries," fast, reliable machines. But soon, the water will rise again, "the tide is coming!" They have no choice but to "drop anchor." So, rickshaw pullers are back in "luck," temporarily changing their name. To the other side.</p>
<p>Leisured friends, driving their cars in the water "for fun," accelerating at full speed, with a "whoosh," the two sides of the car shoot out large bursts of white water, straight at the pedestrians walking by, hitting them in the face, making you feel a cold and "strangely comfortable" sensation, and the people in the car will laugh!</p>
<p>Especially if there are women walking by, preferably fashionable ones, then the "friends" riding bicycles are very fortunate. They will also go up and "whoosh" for a while, and some will even shout - "Elder sister, comfortable, right?" A hearty laugh forward, the high spirits, even come up with a few laps, they "boots" into the water does not matter, as long as there is "doufu" delicious, enough!</p>
<p>The waves, after the car passes, rush straight to the walls on both sides. In places where the water is deep, people cannot stand still, "plop!"</p>
<p>On the Fourth Road, Daxin Street, I watched an old lady in her fifties trying to cross the water street. She didn't know what she stepped on under her feet, and she leaned forward, her feet up in the air. Then there was laughter.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the old lady Deng fell into the water and did not get up. Someone said: "The water is 'vacuum', there is no air inside, so if you fall, you will die!".</p>
<p>The night gives the water even more precious and proud things.</p>
<p>The red and green neon lights are reflected in the water, making them more beautiful and charming.</p>
<p>Movie theaters, opera houses, dance halls, last night's continuous full-house advertisements, can be found everywhere in the newspaper the next day.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of people with a free spirit.</p>
<p>The water gives them no threat, only "novelty".</p>
<p>Beggars, having nowhere to sleep at night, are immersed in the water.</p>
<p>The report from Pushan Villa says that the number of corpses has increased after the autumn chill. But it doesn't matter – the water in Shanghai will still be big and more. Let's wait and see!</p>
<h3>Not Humor</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Beggar: Sir, I haven't eaten all day. Give me five cents to buy a sesame cake.</p>
<p>Pedestrian: (Holding something in one hand, munching on a cake with the other, sees the beggar, shakes his head and ignores him)</p>
<p>Beggar: (Stares firmly, unwilling to give up)</p>
<p>Pedestrian: How can I give you money if you don't open your eyes to beg? (Says while looking at the hands holding the object and half a cake.)</p>
<p>Beggar: (Thinks it's true, gives up and leaves.)</p>
<h3>V Movement?</h3>
<p>— Seifu</p>
<p>This is not a joke, it's a fact.</p>
<p>It is said that the exam for the economic subsidy for poor students, organized by the YMCA this time, had such a question.</p>
<p>What is the V-word movement?</p>
<p>It is also said that many people answered very "brilliantly." Now I will transcribe a few answers for reference</p>
<p>The V-word movement is the advertisement for Five Continents Pharmacy's Vitamine A, B, C, D, E in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Some say: When Jesus died, he launched a movement, and that movement was the V-word movement.</p>
<p>The movement to reorganize old morality is the V-word movement... etc.</p>
<h3>Social Snapshot</h3>
<p>— Shenzhong</p>
<p>An unemployed college student goes to a newspaper office to post a recruitment advertisement, carefully drafting the most economical number of words, two and a half lines, costing two yuan and ten cents. He searches his pockets and only finds one yuan and thirty-four cents, so he greets the clerk: "Sorry, I'm short on money, I'll come back tomorrow."</p>
<p>A middle-aged businessman calls a rickshaw at the Cishu Building to go to the Great World. The rickshaw puller says five jiao. The businessman turns around and leaves. "Sir, rice is expensive!" "Yes, rice is expensive, so save some!"</p>

<p>But Shang Lao Er was a natural slowpoke, he couldn't rush anything. Before he could say anything further, he had to take out an old "Laodao" cigarette, slowly place it on his thumb nail and tamp it for a while, then bend over and slowly walk to a small table to pick up a box of matches to light it.</p>
<p>Liu Baldy stared at him without blinking, his anxiety rising: the right leg he had crossed on the stool was lowered and crossed again, crossed and lowered, as if he was practicing some skill there.</p>
<p>"What exactly are you here for...?" He finally couldn't help but urge Shang Lao Er.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, the most helpless one is that little girl herself!" Shang Lao Er, holding the cigarette in his mouth, walked back and forth in the room, saying with resentment, "She simply doesn't want to learn opera from me anymore. Even if we can scare the old one, it's useless if she herself has changed her mind..."</p>
<p>"Then just beat her to death!" In Liu Baldy's heart, killing someone was easier than killing a fly, as if the law was made by himself.</p>
<p>"Who will pay for her life? Isn't that a joke!" Shang Lao Er said gloomily, "When I was about to leave, her father sent my nephew's wife to say that they were willing to send me a hundred yuan first, and in the future, if Meibao learns opera from her father, no matter where she performs, no matter how much salary she earns, they will definitely send me another hundred yuan every month for the first three years..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the anger that Liu Baldy had been harboring in his stomach disappeared through his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you say so earlier? If you have such an advantage, what are you still unhappy about?" He immediately turned his anger into joy, fully revealing his straightforward personality. "If I had known this, I wouldn't have been angry with you for nothing" (191).</p>
<h3>Old Books Newly Copied</h3>
<p>— Pinjia Layman</p>
<p>Accumulating good and evil has its cause and effect, examining history is not superstition</p>
<p>Recently, I read the family letters of famous people of past dynasties, including a letter from Zhu Wenduan Gong (Shizu Ruozhan, also known as Keting) of Qing Gao'an to his clansmen, describing the great significance of famine relief in lean years, which can serve as a wake-up call to the public who hoard food in isolated islands. I have urgently copied it to share with like-minded people. (The following is the original text) I recently heard that our hometown has suffered from consecutive years of poor harvests, and two out of ten clansmen are starving and waiting for death, while the granaries are decaying and closed and not opened. Alas, how cruel! Gu Xian, in his Answers to Questions on Famine Relief, said: "Starving people can survive if they get a few handfuls of rice a day. Counting one stone a year can save one person from dying. Grains in famine years are limited to this number. If they are not in the stomachs of the starving people, they are in the granaries of the rich. Now, closing one stone without releasing it will surely cause one person to die. Closing ten, hundred, or thousand stones without releasing them will cause ten, hundred, or thousand people to die. Therefore, apart from the daily rations, what is piled up in the granaries is the skin, bones, blood, flesh, and brains of dead people. Saving the cost of one meal can save several people. Saving the cost of one social interaction can save several people? Saving the cost of one hairpin and clothing can save several people? Saving the cost of one donation to monks and Taoists, worshiping gods, paper money, and sacrificial animals can save several people? Using all kinds of things that can save people and wasting them on useless things is considered a heroic act. It is gathering the skin, bones, blood, flesh, and brains of thousands of dead people as a heroic act. How can one bear it!" I have tried to promote his saying that grains are produced by heaven to keep people alive, and they are only temporarily stored in our granaries. But we are stealing what heaven uses to keep people alive and turning it into murder. Murderers die, let alone killing thousands of innocent starving people. The crime is deep and the sins are heavy, and there will surely be strange disasters, near to their own bodies and far to their descendants. The inherited things in the granaries are not piled up from the skin, bones, blood, and flesh of starving people, but the immeasurable strange disasters of their own bodies and their children and grandchildren.</p>
<h3>Cars Fear Flooding</h3>
<p>— Ning Ren</p>
<p>This year, because the Shanghai harbor construction is suspended and there is a lot of rain, every time there is a high tide or heavy rain, the roads immediately turn into the Huangpu River, and cars become boats. However, cars have many problems with flooding, such as damaging their advantages, reducing their lifespan, and increasing additional costs. For example, if a car is driving in two feet of water, its axles will of course be completely submerged. If the speed is at the normal fifteen miles, then most of the oil on the axles will undoubtedly be washed away. Just imagine how expensive it is to reapply the oil under the current isolated island situation. Secondly, the increase in gasoline consumption and the stalls caused by too much water entering the cylinder will all cause the car owner to pay unexpected costs. In addition to the above situations, the brakes may also become ineffective due to flooding. Even after the flood has receded and the roads are dry, sometimes the driver has not repaired the brakes, and such danger often causes problems for road safety and many unfortunate incidents due to speeding and the inability to brake. According to car experts, the car that fears flooding the least is the F× brand, because the position of its vent pipe is different from others. It is said that the four major taxi companies in Shanghai are very unwelcoming to flooding, although the number of trips can be increased, they cannot meet the demand because they cannot travel at the usual speed, losing many customers. Moreover, driving too slowly increases the gasoline, electricity, and repair costs proportionally. As for who welcomes flooding, it is probably rickshaws. In this situation, rickshaw pullers have a good opportunity to exert their power.</p>
<p>From this, I feel the seriousness of the struggle between "human power" and "machinery." (Gratitude)</p>
<p>Definitely Not Humor</p>
<h3>Cleansing the Heart</h3>
<p>— Zhengrong</p>
<p>I read a book and found a section on "Good Ways to Cleanse the Heart and Purify Thoughts." Seeing that the hearts of people in the isolated island are unpredictable and have reached their peak, it is truly necessary to cleanse them. Only this good prescription can have the effect of curing the disease. I have copied it below, hoping that enlightened people in the isolated island will quickly take a dose, which would be very fortunate!</p>
<p>"Loyalty (one piece), Filial Piety (ten parts), Secret Caution (use entirely), Kindness (give as needed), Cautious Words (one flavor), Careful (ten parts), Abstain from Lust (remove the heart), Benevolence and Righteousness (widely used), Honesty (one), Abstain from Gambling (wash clean), Trustworthy Actions (use entirely), Harmony (a group), Convenience (any amount), Patience (one hundred parts), Warm Heart (one piece)</p>
<p>Grind all the above ingredients into fine pieces, add borax to make pills the size of bodhi seeds, and take them with three beneficial friends at any time, taking the calm heart soup slowly and warmly. Be sure to avoid knives in smiles, arrows in the dark, and storms on flat ground."</p>

<h3>Reforming Movie Synopsis</h3>
<p>— Jiedong</p>
<p>Every time a movie is released, a synopsis is given to the audience. This seems like a very ordinary thing, and although this synopsis only explains the story in the movie, its function is to help the audience understand the plot, and it is not a purely formal matter. In this way, the composition of a synopsis should be very rigorous, and it cannot be perfunctorily dealt with. However, most movie theater authorities do not value synopses, and some even regard them as dispensable. Several large movie theaters do pay attention to synopses, but they only pay attention to the paper and printing, which is too focused on form.</p>
<p>The first condition for a perfect synopsis is that its content is rich, not just the paper and printing. When it comes to the content of the synopsis, it refers to its text. The text of general synopses is in classical Chinese, which is often cliché. Perhaps this is because they want to be elegant, but sometimes it becomes difficult to read. Since the synopsis is explaining the story hidden in the movie and helping the audience understand the plot, then it should focus on being simple and clear. At the same time, the audience's level of understanding is very inconsistent, so it must be considered for the majority of people and not write the synopsis very deeply just for the sake of a few people with a high level of understanding. That is not helpful in practice.</p>
<p>There was a period when several movie theaters paid close attention to the text of the synopsis, but this period was very short and soon passed. I hope that the movie theater authorities will revive the promotion so that the synopsis can fully express its function and not go against the original meaning of having a synopsis. In addition to explaining the story, it is also very necessary to provide a brief summary of the main theme of the movie, because it can further enhance the audience's understanding of the play. I have seen the synopses of several movies that have adopted this method, such as the synopsis of "The Secret of the Wax Museum" which has a short paragraph at the beginning called "Theme," which explains the theme of the play. Another example is the synopsis of "Sai Jinhua," although it does not indicate which paragraph is the "Theme" and which paragraph is the main text of the "Story," it also has such a short paragraph of text at the beginning. However, it is very rare to adopt this method, and it is really rare to see it. This is very worthy of imitation and is not without meaning.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Movie synopses do indeed provide a lot of convenience to the audience, especially foreign movies. You must read the synopsis first to understand the plot; otherwise, people with a childish level of English, or even people who do not understand English, will waste two hours of their time and feel completely lost, which reduces their interest in watching the movie. Some hardworking young people often collect the synopses with Chinese and English translations and use them as self-study reading materials. What do you think its importance is? Jiedong's opinions are contributed to Chinese and foreign movie theaters, and I think they are worth considering.</p>
<p>The Torch Drama Society was established in the winter of 1936. At that time, it was initiated by Xia Xia, He Bin, Huang He, Zhang Guoguang and others. It has performed several times. After the war, the society's affairs were virtually suspended due to the dispersal of its members. Now they are active again, and their society address is at 24 Yongqingfang, Dagu Road. They are preparing to revive their performances. It is heard that the play is a five-act famous play "Love" originally written by the British Rudolf Bess, translated and directed by Zhang Guoguang, and will be performed at the Russian Art Theater at the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa (Beautiful Flower)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Where does the powerful family force a return?</p>
<p>Yuan Yuan, upon hearing these words, bit her silver teeth and asked, "So when are they coming to take me away?" The foster mother said, "Today at noon. Last night, before leaving, Master Gao agreed with me. He repeatedly warned me not to reveal a word to you until they arrived today, fearing you would oppose it. Today, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I had to explain it to you." Upon hearing this, Yuan Yuan couldn't help but fall straight back, collapsing listlessly into the chair. A loud ringing filled her ears, and her vision blurred, making her feel dizzy. It was as if something was stuck in her throat. Seeing her like this, the foster mother said, "I knew you wouldn't be happy to hear this news, so I didn't want to tell you all along. However, since we will soon be parting ways, how can I not say a few words to you? Please take care of yourself and don't be depressed. Going to a noble family, you will surely live a life of ease and luxury, far better than finding an ordinary family. As long as the father-in-law of the emperor favors you, you will have unparalleled good fortune." The foster mother said this as if to comfort her. But Yuan Yuan was filled with anger, hatred, sorrow, and pain. She thought to herself, "The words the 'Flower Butterfly' said to me last night were indeed meaningful, but I unfortunately had a prior appointment with the poet and didn't examine them closely. Who knew they would have such a move? Clearly, they feared I would oppose and disobey, so they did this. It's a pity my appointment with the poet is already too late. If they come first, then I won't be able to leave. What am I to do?" At this moment, Yuan Yuan was so anxious she didn't know what to do. After a long, long time, she finally said to her foster mother, "If Tian Hongyu wanted me to go, there would be no reason to be so rushed. Waiting another two or three days would be fine. How can it be so sudden? When they come in a little while, please help me discuss it with them and try to postpone it. Otherwise, I cannot possibly go with them so hastily." The foster mother frowned and said, "Of course, I can say that. But whether they listen or not, I cannot guarantee. Think about it, the emperor's father-in-law wants a woman from our brothel. Isn't that an easy matter?" (148)</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles</h3>
<p>— Shao Xian</p>
<p>(4) Cheng Yuqing's Many Romantic Affairs (Part 1)</p>
<p>Cheng Yuqing was originally from the South. A decade or so ago, when the famous courtesan Hua Xiaofang was all the rage in Hankou, Yuqing was the Qin player who played the Yueqin for Hua Xiaofang. However, Yuqing had studied stagecraft in a Hankou troupe for many years in his youth. Although he later took this path, he had received considerable training in everything related to "opera." Therefore, Hua Xiaofang was able to receive guidance from Yuqing in the area of "opera," and because of this close proximity, they developed an ambiguous relationship over time. As a result, this famous courtesan of Hankou, who was known throughout the north, rejected wealthy merchants and tycoons and instead followed Yuqing into respectable life. At the time, Hua Xiaofang had quite a bit of money in her hands, so she and Yuqing came from Hankou to Shanghai to live their life as a loving couple. When Yuqing arrived in Shanghai, it was, of course, a different scene altogether. He then began to conduct further research in the field of "opera" and learned opera from the master Gu Muchao. Yuqing was very intelligent and talented. He learned the Dan roles, and he could learn any Dan opera at once. Because Hua Xiaofang knew that Yuqing had such talent, she very much hoped that Yuqing could become a "star." Therefore, she decided to send Yuqing to the North to study under Yaoqing in order to seek advanced training. At the time, Hua Xiaofang spared no effort and spent all her money for Yuqing's future. Finally, heaven did not disappoint her. After Hua Xiaofang spent several "grass-heads" (grass-head referring to tens of thousands), Yuqing finally entered the King's Gate. Moreover, after entering the King's Gate, he was fortunate to be treated differently by Yaoqing, who cared for him with utmost care. Almost everything in Yaoqing's mind was given completely to Yuqing. Yuqing's art could have reached its level today, and of course, he cannot but be grateful for the teacher's kindness in recognizing his talent.</p>
<p>A Quick Sketch of a Film Star</p>
<h3>(21) Robert Donat</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>When Donat was seventeen years old, he performed in Shakespeare's famous play, Julius Caesar. At that time, he played the role of Lucius in the play and was greatly praised by the audience. In the following four years, he spent almost all of his time seeking roles he should play in Shakespeare's plays. In 1928, he came to London. After that, he began to seek his fortune in Hollywood. Although he starred in many famous films, such as "A Tale of Two Cities" and "The Count of Monte Cristo", he still could not be considered successful. Even though he was already recognized as a big star and a successful actor in the eyes of movie fans, it was not until he starred in "Goodbye Mr. Chips" that his acting reached its peak. Donat's family has moved around almost all of Europe, from Italy, France, Germany, Poland, and finally settled in England. He was born in Milton, Lancashire, and his wife's name is Isla Wassell. They have three children, the eldest being nine years old.</p>
