<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰重心在大西洋</h3>
<p>檢討最近地中海兩岸的戰局，聯軍情形的確未可樂觀：北非英軍去冬兩月所獲得的進展。不旋踵而皆失之，重新恢復到保衛埃及之戰；巴爾幹戰事已日益逼近雅典，所謂德摩比利與馬拉松反敗爲勝的奇蹟重演恐怕都只徒勞夢想，英軍之撒退將爲時間問題，這兩週間的戰役，誠如本報日昨社論所指出，聯軍始終就不曾有過主動的運用。最近英　朝野，關於利比亞德國機械化部隊之竟得上陸，關於希臘英軍的赴援與撤退，曾有種種爭論與辯解，可見英方在那一方面的軍事部署，確亦有未能盡愜人意之處。然而這不一定就是英國佈置的疏漏與戰略的失敗，邱吉爾本月九日在國會演說中曾經表示：「軍略不應以體面與輿論而使其複雜化」，利比亞與巴爾幹的戰事，衡之邱氏這一見解，似乎正應歸納於體面與輿論關係大於軍略價値的一類。</p>
<p>如果說英方對於地中海兩岸的戰役不加置重，自然並非事實，但却絕不認爲那是戰事重心所寄，據英當局的見解，大西洋纔是眞正的重心。邱吉爾在上述同一演說中說：「吾人只須在大西洋戰事中獲侍勝利，且確保美國供應品之源源輸入，則不問希特勒如何進展，吾人終能制其死命，」這一段話申述了英方的主要信念和動向，同時也說明了英國對於大西洋以外種種角逐的看法：納粹在歐洲大陸以主巴爾幹的進展，固然不盡是英方所得而阻遏，英當局也不願於此支付過多代價以致牽制主力決戰的準備和進行。當此度巴爾幹戰爭甫經擴大之初，曾有人懷疑德方會不會趁舉世注目南希局勢之際，突然大舉攻英，因爲希特勒的主妥軍力始終都留在西綫，其所用以東進者不過較小的一部分而已。這一杞憂固然幸而未成事實，同時這大槪也就是英方不肯過分重視東地中海兩岸戰事的緣故。</p>
<p>現在巴爾幹之役己近尾聲，次一舉世矚目的問題當然是德方進一步的動向如何。乘巴爾幹戰勝餘威，進　移師束指，以鉗形攻勢窺向近東油田與蘇彝士運河，固然似乎是德國東進路綫的自然歸趨，但却不要忘却此度納粹之在巴爾幹大舉作戰原屬不得已的被動性質，依其自身意欲，無寗到更希望能夠和平掠取並僅以堵塞英軍乘虛深入的通路爲已足，德軍之在地中海兩岸者也還不能驟即模擬爲鉗形的兩翼，縱其在形式上的略相似，在實質上則巴爾幹是主力攻戰，在利比亞則僅屬牽制作用，不過幸逢英方守力消弱，乃得長驅進展而已。是以其此際是否會因利乘便而竟銳意東進實成問題。以英軍實力言：在巴爾幹去遏阻德軍雷霆萬鈞的攻勢固嫌不足，以言保衛近東油田與蘇彝士運河，則其海陸雙方共同作戰實力的發揮似尚有餘。而德方鉗形的兩翼，叉各自有其軍事上與政治上的困難，與缺陷，地中海與達旦尼爾海峽的天嶄，蘇聯土耳其的微妙地位，都是利於英而不利於德的因素，何况德軍的閃電特長，只有在密邇後方且名種便利條件一槪具備的塲合纔能發揮盡致，前進愈深，功效愈减，北非德方機械化部隊最初能以旬日之間連克要塞，却終於不能不被阻於埃及邊境，正說明了閃電戰略的應用自有其相當限度。</p>
<p>假如上面的推斷不差，則未來的雙方角逐必然是在大西洋方面展開，近來節令漸暖，就連英倫海峽的風濤也要比冬令寧靜，正利於這一攻戰的進行。實際上就是在巴爾幹戰事淮行正烈期間，德方也從未忽略大西洋方面空中與海上的襲擊。據十九日路透社從英艦隊所發消息；『德方在過去數週中，已有較開戰以來任何時期更廣大的使用其海軍之徵象』，預料此後更當有加無已，無論如何，「餓斃英國一，與阻止美國根據租借法案的援英戰具到達。當爲希特勒所最感切要的問題。連日德方已向維希法政府及西班牙頻施壓力，西班牙政府最近的提高預算與一再召開緊急閣議已引人側目，維希的海軍首領達爾期又復僕僕於維希巴黎之間，儼然代替了前此拉伐爾的任務，德方此一企圖已往雖一再遭受挫折，但現在德軍在巴爾幹的戰勝無疑已增加了脅迫法西的此重，另一方面，英美對西班牙的經濟壓力，貝當所曾表示的善意中立，究能抵禦德方壓力到何等程度尚屬疑問。德方這一步驟自然是準備大西洋大戰的前奏，假如希臘之戰不幸而竟在最近告一段落，則戰局焦點必立即由地中海東部移到西端，這一前途，英方也早已在絕大警惕和準備中從事等待。</p>
<p>希特勒只有能在大西洋制勝之後纔有擊潰英國的希望，英國也只有能克服制壓德方在大西洋的攻勢纔可能進而考慮對德反攻。此度巴爾幹戰爭如僅以希臘之戰爲終點，則大致可以保持局部戰爭的性質，不致驟即影響世界其他角度；預料大西洋的未來問題必難如此單純，那不只是英德雙方勝負所繫，同時也必然是整個世界正義與暴力消長的關鍵。</p>
<h3>日縱封鎖全部海口　無法斷絕華經濟命脈　內地各種工業早已樹立鞏固基礎　日用物品幾已達目給自足之境地</h3>

<p>華盛頓　據抵達此間之外交消息謂、德己施行新攻勢、擬勸誘國法及西班牙參加「新秩序」、據悉、美駐法西兩國大使現正努力抵制德方之新攻勢、並力稱、美國無窮之資源、現正爲英國之後盾、法西兩國愼勿誤入歧途、美政府對此决外交戰之結果頗表關懷、而允以法國爲甚、蓋若使法國將其艦隊交與德國、並使納粹使用其根據地、則英國之戰局愈形惡劣矣、此間人士對希特勒　提賴伐爾復職之要求頗感憂慮、有識之士深信、若賴伐爾獲得要職、則法海軍必不久將起而與英倫作戰、此間外交方面謂、維希政府中之親德分子漸有抬頭之象、（二十三日國際社電）</p>
<p>德圖利用法屬北非</p>
<p>倫敦　關於德方提出德軍假道法國非淪陷區與西班牙之任何建議、現無所知、惟衆信德方亟欲維希召回魏剛將軍、因德方希望利用法屬北非口岸爲軍事行動根據地、而視魏剛爲此種希望之障礙也、同時德方向法商訂購大批戰具及其他貨物之成單巳經許可、法德工業合作乃已加緊、但無論達蘭之傾向如何、貝當對德拒不給予任何陸海軍讓步、以免牽涉其對英之立塲、貝當迄未有更變此立塲之微象、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國內閣　傳將改組　達蘭再赴巴黎　與德當局談話</h3>
<p>維希　內閣協理達蘭中將、擬於今日前往巴黎、與德當局賡續進行重要談話、惟關於談話內容、凡接近內閣協理者均拒不有所透示、此在外交界觀察家則談稱、德駐法大使亞倍茲最近返國述職時、曾前往巴爾幹半島前綫希特勒兀首行營晋謁元首、請示機宜、似此達蘭中將此决前往巴黎與德當局進行談話、自有特殊意義、前者亞倍茲大使甫自德國返抵巴黎、大抵凡與法德兩國關係有關之各項問題均當提付討論、且達蘭中將行抵巴黎之後、仍當與前任內閣協理賴伐爾交換意見、據尚未證實之消息達蘭與頓伐爾二氏現正考慮如何合作、內閣或將因此局部改組、盛傳內長及財長將更迭、惟因政界人士對於此事咸皆保持緘默、此種謠諑有無根據尚難斷言云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西班牙撥巨款　建維哥港　使成太平洋岸　主要港口之一</h3>
<p>西班牙羅哥港　國務會議曾決定建該羅哥港、使之成爲西國在太平洋沿岸主要港口之一、所需經費頗爲浩大、決定先撥五千五百萬批索達（西國幣名）爲初步工程經費、（廿二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>北非德軍　前進受阻　由於給養困難　台西在激戰中</h3>
<p>開羅　西利內加方面巡邏隊仍多在埃及邊界之加普索砲台與索倫四週活動、過去二十四小時內、敵軍未向杜白魯克進攻、惟巡邏隊常有活動、納粹方面現解釋北非德軍前進受阻之主因爲天然困雞、而非英軍之抵抗力、柏林某報載文論給養問題稱、戰其須先運至里比亞、然後橫貫沙漠運至前敵、卡車須裝特殊車輪、除用以運軍火外、叉須載運戰地廚房所用之鮮水與燃料、及飛機坦克車等戰械化配備所需之大量汽油云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　阿比西尼亞境南非英軍中路透社特派員從台西大道來　稱、英軍攻取台西之戰役繼續進行、反身作戰之義軍現正從事柯倫戰役以後最頑强之抵抗、此處夜間嚴寒、畫間酷熱、南非英軍艱苦奮戰、衣衫被荊棘所撒破、更遇暴風雨、衣履盡濕、但彼等戰志堅毅、亟欲消滅北路義軍殘餘、義軍則據山脊憑險發砲、而英軍亦加還擊、因敵軍隱匿深溝高壘中、英軍作戰爲雞、故前進或將稍緩、惟英軍官深信漸迫漸近、義軍終將潰敗、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>直布羅陀　防務增強　運河行將工竣</h3>
<p>倫敦　直布羅陀之防務已大加增强、沿砲台北面寬九呎深十二呎之運河、巳將告竣、重砲及高射砲亦均見增加、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>葡萄牙增防　亞索斯島</h3>
<p>里斯　葡萄牙北部之軍隊已開抵此間、將於今日乘船開往中大西洋葡屬亞索斯羣島、藉以增强該島之防務、今日己是第三决開往該島之軍隊、故該島之防務力量已超過平時多倍、此因美國報章主張美國或英國佔領葡萄牙殖民地、葡政府遂決定此項步驟、此間官塲人士對美國之報章言論均持極保留之熊度、但均相信葡萄牙將遭遇英美侵佔大西洋中之屬地、葡政府現所發表之公告、均謂葡國領袖及外交代表當盡力維護國家之權利藉以安定民心云、（廿三日海通電）</p>
<p>歐戰叢談（四）（六）</p>
<h3>美國海軍大觀</h3>
<p>所以海軍根據地好像是大洋中的踏步石，海軍而欲握得海上霸權，那根據地是萬萬少不來的呢。如果海軍中只有船舶而沒有根據地，全艦隊的軍艦，就要伶仃無靠，沒有地方去裝燃料，損壞了沒有地方去修理，因之就沒有法子在茫茫大海之中，作千萬里的長征了。</p>
<p>一個完美的海軍根據地，須備具下列三種要素：一，地位，必須在軍事上爲一必爭的要點，而使艦隊能控制自己的貿易航錢。二，力量，須有完備之設施，使整個艦隊得以舒適泊碇。出入路綫最好有兩處。在天然屏障之外，具有火力偉大之砲壘及高射砲。三，資源，天然資源如水，食物，燃料，等均須充分備具，良好之交通及熟練之人力，亦爲不可少之因素。在實際講起來，盡善盡美的海軍根據地十分難得。也許夏威夷島根據地較爲合於理想。新加坡雖然很好，但是跡近孤立，而給養也不甚容易。去年九月初，羅斯福總統獲得美國在紐芬蘭至基阿那島之問，英屬地帶內建設海軍根據地之權。海軍專家都說，此舉在美國不啻多添造了五艘主力戰艦。他們又說，如果美國要防衛南美，一如北美者，則她在那里應該也要築起海軍根據地來。</p>
<p>美國除了大西洋和太平洋沿岸的家鄉海軍根據地，都是設備完全，足以供應其艦隊之外，外面還有三處主要的根據地，即夏威夷，巴拿瑪，和正在築造中的卡利俾安海軍根據地。運河地帶的一個設備完全的根據地業己築就，聖的翰根據地除了主力戰鬥艦之外，共他艦舶都能在內碇泊。奎塔那瑪灣最宜於軍艦碇泊之用，故在卡利俾安區域中，以此地爲主要之海灣。太平洋中美國擁有鉅大之珍珠灣海港，航空根據地則在河留西安至繭摩阿一帶之間。馬尼拉海灣中也設有一個不設防的修理船塢。美艦隊航行於遠太平洋中，接近日本或蘭屬東印度者，很需要一個根據地，當局擬借用英國的新加坡軍港，當然也是辦法之一。香港與波特達文如能闢爲根　地的話，對於美國海軍的修理或添置燃料，稗益亦多。</p>
<p>（七）理想中的近代海軍</p>
<p>建設近代的海軍決非短期　所能完成。從一塊塊厚至十五六吋的船壳鋼板鑄起，慢慢地裝配起來，方能組成想理中偉大的兩洋海軍。如以目下的建軍經費來講，嗣後每年的海軍力量，將如下述：一九四一年底，戰鬥艦十四艘，驅逐艦一百七十六艘，潛水艇一百十五艘。一九四二年，巡洋艦四十一艘，航空母艦七艘，驅逐艦一百八十九艘，潛水艇一百二十八艘。（戰鬥艦此時仍祇十四艘，日本一九四二年爲十四艘，一九四三年大的亦同。）一九四三年下半年後，將有戰鬥艦二十艘。一九四六年戰鬥艦大增，可多至二十九艘，航空母艦十八艘，巡洋艦八十七艘，驅逐艦三百二十二艘。如果世界上能在這幾年中不發生巨變，那末屆時美國的海軍就能稱雄海上了。除了這樣龐大的海軍之外，尚有好幾百架巨型巡邏轟炸機，和海軍陸戰隊士兵，隨時隨地幫同作戰。</p>
<p>六十年前，美國海軍少將馬罕，即海軍大學的創辦人，曾有幾句至理名言道，陸地上到處崎嶇，而海上却是平坦得很，任何國家只要有擁有能控制這大海的艦隊，而使商船在海面上駛行來往，那末全世界的財富不愁不會歸她所有了。他又說，海上的力量看上去好像靜默無聲，即在戰時，比起了陸軍也要靜得多，只要能堅守少數的海上軍事要點，像直布羅陀，巴拿瑪，新加坡等等，把握住世界市塲，就無異統治了全世界哩。</p>
<p>一八九〇年馬罕少將所說的話，到現在其原則還是沒有變更，而新兵器倒產生了不少，戰術亦就跟同轉變。譬如偵察飛機能造成許多夢想不到奇蹟，海軍航空母艦能把轟炸機帶至任何對自己有利的區域，其仃動之速超過敵人在陸上建築機塲的時間。飛機又能把驅逐艦甚至巡洋艦炸沉。在此番而次歐戰中，惟有戰鬥艦尚水受到飛機的威脅。</p>
<p>擁有充實海軍力量的國家，在遭遇敵人進擊時，可不致把整個的國家弄得糜爛，或不可收拾。所以局部的災厄，像英國於一六六七，一七四五，一七八三，一七丸七，及一九四〇等年所遭遇者，總有方法去抵禦。不過據馬罕氏的定例，任何國家的海軍，如欲佔得最優勢，其軍艦的數量一定要超過人家。根據地一定要建築堅强，地位衝要。在平時又要有充份的人力儲備。作戰時，一見機會到來，即須向敵人的艦隊猛攻，加以毀滅。攻擊時必須集中全部力量去作戰。美國海軍之所以要集中全力而成一個艦隊者，其故即在此。</p>
<p>艦隊在作戰之時，行動旣須敏捷，進攻又須勇猛，因爲所有造艦，駕駛，訓練，裝配，集中等步驟，概須於戰事發作之前，一一準備妥貼。海軍的唯一任務，在作戰時，一股　氣，看準機會，向敵人來一個致命的大打擊。把敵人的艦隊與商船在海面上一掃而肅淸之。因之世界上兩大商務國家，美合衆國與不列顚，擁有最的强盛海軍呢。</p>

<h3>糧食　笑問限價何處去　米商遙白雲間　暗盤橫漲過鉅昨日小回頭　來源不愁缺乏只患不整頓</h3>
<p>昨日米市漲風稍經回挫、各檔交易不獨减少、即　市　價亦巳回降三四百元及五六百元不一、實因連日騰漲過份、一般奸會即不顧公理人道而昧心經營、當亦當返顧其自身之危險、故昨日業中人多未上市賣買、市面形勢大爲緩和、雖仍有一部份市儈借假邇日定貨未能繼續成交也、某洋行所拋二月份期米迄未解貨也、（按建源拋售二月份小絞、確有延緩至今尚未解淸）、日軍南進也、沿海各區陷落也、然終未能激刺新囤、且獲利浮多頗有吐出、故小絞每百包貼價初爲一千二百元、繼小至一千元、現貨即出祇原包一百五十十一二元、遠期一百五十四五元、尚乏受主、西貢一號米初喊一千三百包、繼至一千一二百元、其他一律跟小、成交亦祇六七千包、</p>
<p>又訊咋港當局派人到申與租界當局及米業商定每月由港供給申市二十萬至二十五萬包，但限制同業、並限利潤在百分之　以內、此爲昨米價回小之一因、</p>
<p>再加以米業中人亦自知不雅、昨又故示整頓、作一番書面表不、大言炎炎、居然以「遵軌交易、弗再越限買賣」、自欺欺人、掮客活動多日、昨亦自動停業三天、以避風浪、有問以旣須遵軌交易、則工部局之新限價何在、米商遙指犬空白雲、顧而言他、於以知　所表示者言不由　、亦以見限價之如天空浮雲、區無蹤　、</p>
<p>國米稍有開出、而售價因　　困難、到貨　星、實鉗應需亟亟、依然高漲三四元、無錫高粳售百四十元、崑粳百三十六元、靑角薄稻百念九元、</p>
<p>洋米接連而來、太古公司穎州輪昨晨抵滬、由香港裝洋米八千五百八十一包、其中五千零五十一包、在滬起卸、餘者明日原船運往華北、計靑島一千一百包、烟台一千八百三十包、天津六百包、另有苞米九百四十包、亦原船運往烟台、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市先緊後平</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日先緊後平、上午開市、在本客活動之下、囤戶依然居間作祟、花烏牌澳粉哄至三十一元三四角、金龍脾坎粉三十一元至三十元〇八九角、惟後市因米價回挫、散戶略有傾吐、故局勢漲後轉平、統市成交一萬五六千包、市面脚地仍穩、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十五元、由福新廠供給五千八百七十三包、暫乏變動云、</p>
<p>小麥沉寂如常、查內地杜麥供源久乏、華廠原料無法收取、日廠　市、偶有零星收進者、爲數極微、售價仍爲四十五六元、市面一時漲跌兩難、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅越軌　迄未少止</h3>

<h3>金融　外滙暗市　已臻穩定</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、各匯未更、英美匯暗市由鬆回平、乃旣因金價旋跌復漲、故華商投機家及日銀行供意中淡、英行匯豐麥加利有利均有吸進、故本月美金二决硬至五元一八七五、均旋復難結、終爲五元一五六二五、英金呆站爲三辦士一七一八七五、均與上日晚收價相彷、半日交易不稀、銀行互做居多、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>英美未有軒輊</p>
<p>自晨外電、英美銀價均平、印市續縮、各國匯兌、美對英小半分、美對滬縮六分、餘平、內盤早開銀行賣出價、現貨英匯三辦士一七一八七五、美金五兀一五六二五、投　家首寒五月美金五元一八七五、俄　硬至難賣、但亦難結、浙實與止金售出四五月美金五元一八七五、由大陸及麥加刺匯豐等買進、匯豐掛脾各匯未更、小櫃檯掛縮〇六二五、後聞大通出華行本月美金五元一八七五、又稍趨硬、近午有利忽有吸胃、進某行本月價亦五元一八七五、當復回平、正午收市、現貨至五月期均英匯三辦士一七一八七五、美金五元一五六二五、均與上日收市價間云、</p>

<h3>金價所漲尙微</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、先跌後漲、六千七百元大關又曾兩决敲破後、均即回出、各方人心稍形不定、因外滙美金穩中帶硬、證券幫與金號幫供求條忽、晨開後滙票商叶售、曾見六千六百八十五元、即爲銀號幫力進提上、午刻忽謠本市中交將撤退無稽傳說、助長買勢、哄達六千七百四十二元、後悉四行將在新址聯合復業、人心稍定、小錢莊猛出回挫、收市尚軋升二十四元、半日交易共一萬五六千兩、下午週三無市、塲外價爲六千七百三十元、掉期（四月轉入五月期）賣方貼出予買方三十五元、現金先由永豐餘售予順源五十兩、價照期交高一百五十元、萬豐出銀樓業十兩、高一百四十元、永成出四十兩、金號出五十兩、均銀樓業買進、高一百四十五元、的升三十元、飾金亦掛高五元、達七百十元、</p>
<p>烚赤漲念四元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市爲六千七百十元、比上日晚收價高五兀、决續升至六千七百十五元、忽聞本月美金五元一八七五可結、義元。益大。成　。新豐永來售出、立見步降三十元、入六千七百元內、遜至六千六百八十五元、同康永。德孚。但記來買進、當見提出七百元關、成記。公大。時和亦來買、始至六千七百廿二元、益大再售在六千七百十元左右、盤旋甚久、十一點十分父遜至六千六百九十元、俄復步上、十一點四十分、忽起利多謠傳、成記公和再進、益大復購、跟進者繁起、立見哄至六千七百四十二元、後經順源猛售、爲數不少、頓見壓下至六千七百二十元、正午收市六千七百廿九元、比上日收價漲廿四元、照五月美金午收五元一五六二五結價、爲六千七百五十四元、計撳廿五元、收後又退至六千七百十七元、後二十元、上半日有五十七元上落、下午週三無市、塲外價升至六千七百三十元、現金號之本脾金、售價比烚赤期交價高一百六十元、收　比售出低八十元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金掛高五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、初掛七百〇五元、正午升五元、計七百十元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<p>美鈔勢呈盤旋</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、盤旋略漲、英美金鎊則無變動、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票仍不脫盤勢、晨開十八元九角四分、開後曾退至八角九分、旋又高至九元零四分、收槃十八元九角半、比上日軋升四分、香港票及日金票供求均勻、市價站平、後者仍爲二元一角、朝鮮票略趨堅挺、晚市爲一元八角四分、</p>
<h3>證券　公債動盪</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况、初隨前日收盤之回堅、繼續趨上、無奈塲內浮多過於擁擠、逢高時有人乘機出脫、復又回小、再由多方拉提終仍拉提不住而回小、此則環境使然、加之四仃尚無復業之期、人心空虛、一時殊不易挽回頹勢、其根本原因、實以金融界行將有所變動、殊非公債之福、昨上午初由同康買進、協康補空、抬高三四角、怡泰。恒孚。乘高脫手、後有聯益。永昌。買進、而甡昶。易中。仍有賣出、午收尚屬穩定、午後謠言更多、人心震撼、雖聯和。益昌。怡泰。買進、而賣氣仍濃、如生興。鼎康。德隆。鑫豐。順泰。紛紛出籠、市價乃又站立不住、甲種又打破三元、乙種又打破六元、且數日來、丁種始終未能開出、市塲不少求售者、而竟無人接受、所以仍未能做開、趨勢及環境仍係利空、一日結果、稍小一角至四角、成交的一百八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股一百股、價為十九元五角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所、股市開盤迄午收、市勢平庸、交易淸稀、時有乏人問津之慨、下午週三無市、</p>
<h3>馬來橡股派息－惠靈登亦派息－</h3>

<h3>紗花　運輸阻塞　紗市頹唐</h3>
<p>紗市平疲、艮趨勢帶軟、此因歐洲局勢急轉直下、浙東戰事尤劇、以致運輸綫阻塞，所以空頭活躍、標金雖昂、人心未能激昂、暫時情况、仍在下檔盤旋、不過有一部份因百物昂貴、拖進之額依然不肯放棄、因此市態復入迂通之境中、目前塲上悄形、拋賣者似已較夥也、二十支雙馬高價為一千五百〇二元、低價爲一千叫百八十二元、午後初做價爲一千四白九十二元、漲至一千四白九十六元最後價爲一千四百九十五元云、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開承上日午後大跌、人氣疲乏無勁、且傳說紛紜、首盤價爲一千四百八十五元、少頃微升至九十四元、但證劵幫之空頭按兵勿動、反有加碼趨勢、同時標金開盤平平、檯面少力、市盤漸漸而下至一千四百八十三元、此時盈利者奮起抵補、拉力較强、叉復漲至一千四百九十二元、進退殊久、迨至十一時半後、多頭活動、大衆叫喊齊開、漲出五百〇二元、然價格一高、依然站不穩、一霎間仍跌至一千四百九十二元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千三百五十二包、茲將各幫口實去之額量、分別如左、</p>
<p>香港　三四二內地　一〇同行六、〇〇〇統計六、三五二</p>
<h3>棉花廠需轉滯　同業交易亦靜</h3>
<p>現棉情况、寥寥如恒、良以世界戰雲彌漫、加之紗市不振廠方心思轉滯、至於同業鑒於以上情形、意與亦不及昔日之興奮、所以交易大爲减淸也、昨成交祇火機花一筆、由同裕進三百包、機交價一百九十六元、尚係草包貨、比上日市價似巳跌區二元外、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、因各方暫取觀望熊度、而成交不多、但市况仍屬堅定、絕不因局勢不靖、買方平淡而見弱、反之一般執有手貨者、仍不願輕易脫售、昨日除同業互做一二批小額印棉外、其餘皆袖手旁觀也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業買進　漲、繼之又因南方幫賣出、及多頭了結而回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日低落七至十二磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因股票市塲有力而漲旋因棉商拋空而跌、但最後又因同業買進再漲、收盤價格、各漲二三羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况看跌二羅比半「每件紗重量四二〇磅計，合的四元許」，每都細紡車，英國（Doberson）式是三六四錘，美國式是四〇〇錘，須配用六匹至八匹爲達一具，通常的電力轉動數，每分鍊自八百轉至一千轉，每部車用電量二〇〇字弱，照目前的馬達電價，每一字需一角九分，比戰前差不多要加起了十倍，那麽有一萬紗錠的　費負擔，（十萬字計）月需一萬九千兀，而擁有十萬錠以上的紗廠，雷費負擔更屬驚人，月需國幣二十餘萬元，每月生產紗六千五百包計，每包紗的電力開繳，須三十多元了，（生產量少的每包電耗四十元。亦不足爲奇）。如果於本月廿四日後，超過電流分配量白分之七十外。（限額外）按限額外六倍收費的話，那麽每包紗的電力開繳，豈非要超過百元了嗎，這眞是各大紗廠的一個嚴重問題，倘因節的電力之故，而减工百分之五十（筆者估計），則工人工作减去了一半，亦即工資减去了一半，如此影響於男女工人生活，亦異常嚴重，因而發生勞資料紛，影響於整個社會治安，更其不寒而慄，吾故說：目前孤島之工商社會，眞已處於刀鋸，鼎鑊！四面楚歌之中，豈獨紗廠之難關而已，然電力節的，從小處着想，華廠之損失不少，但在民族工業立塲上去衡量，還是利多害少。（龍）</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價疲落</h3>
<p>廠布昨市疲落、乃因浙閩幫預定各布亟求在滬脫售而同業及囤戶削價吸收、致白貨售盤一蹶不振、細布斜紋每疋續跌三角至七角五分、粗布跌二角半至五角、漂染布及粗斜紋價較穩定、本街成交各布四百餘件、粵港幫辦色布色斜綫呢等二百餘件、南洋幫辦藍布黃綠卡其漂布等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布晨疲午回、市勢略堅、龍頭細布晨巾收盤五十一元二角半、後市回升三角、爲五十一元五角半、四君子嗶嘰晚收每碼一元五角四分七厘半、亦漲五厘、</p>
<h3>派力司已有接濟</h3>
<p>素色派力司、昨市趨勢見軟、怡和五福圖牌子、　降沽二十一元扣佣、尚無原箱受主、因有確訊利興及洪盛貨、不旬日有三百箱可運到、此外俄商及猶太人經營行家、聞該派力司現貨、不久亦有一千疋接濟抵滬、致市氣動搖、其有相當囤積者、欲爭先出籠、母奈事實演出、雖喊賤五六角一碼、一時間仍難開出云、</p>
<h3>日廠布置出路　染織廠大主顧</h3>
<p>現在投機棉布的標準、是日商裕豐紗廠出品十二磅龍頭細布、現貨棧單交易在「布業市塲」（漢口路二五號三樓）、從前稱「白貨市塲」、專交易日廠織物細布細斜等、由棉布公會管轄、今年因發假棧單故、乃與棉布公會脫離、由某幫組成變相的「布業市塲」、期貨是在綿業取引所株式會社」交易、由日商組成其最大用途、是染成各種色布（即陰丹士林等）、漂染廠的牌子、即可以「國貨」之名、銷售內地與南洋各處、通行無阻、但因做了大衆投機標準、價格高過其他各牌、變成投機籌碼、染織廠反採用日廠彩球、陽鶴、藍鷄等牌做逐布、其成本每疋大概三十多元、被投機商的濫進妄抬、價格拉到五十多元、但市面上的籌碼充滿、存底豐厚、而實銷毫無、因爲運銷淪陷區、被日方軍部所統制、運銷自由中國區、被國府嚴禁、而日價格遠超過成本、廠方不斷開出、假如多頭一出籠、大有一瀉千里之勢、如去年五月份的慘跌、倒閉的棉布號不知多少、正爲此故、（霽虹）</p>

<p>前日糖價、因上落過鉅、恐有他變、故經糖業執監會議結果、對於期糖粗白暫予限制新買賣、並規定最高價不得超過一百零八元、於是漲勢轉平、但仍不失堅昂之態、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白初爲一百零二元至一元半。一元、後復回升爲一百零三元。四元。三一元七角、期貨亦先平後昂、四月底打單一百零二元。一元半二元二角。二元。三元半。五元半。五元。四元，四元半。四元、降三四兀、五月十日打單一百零三元。二元半。二元七角。二元八角。三元。四元。四元半。六元。六元八角。六元。五元。五元半、比最高價小三元半、荷赤八十元比（十七日）升度近十元、太古車白B嘜西棧一百十一元、東棧一百十元比（二十一日）升五元許、DY嘜東西棧扯一百零二元、升七元、HX嘜西棧一百零二元、升度同、本廠雪白亦乘時活動、昂至一百零二元、本四號白九十八元、晶明冰亦見一百三十八元新高價、本冰花靑叫八十五元、</p>
<h3>油蔴　蔴袋堅穩</h3>
<p>蔴袋市價、邇來起伏不定、現在漸趨堅穩、查市存仍薄、而連日去化轉動、如二磅半新綠經己達五元五角、二磅二五爲五元二角、叉沖新袋五元、本街冲新袋四元八角、米白綫四元六角、米麥冲新四元二角、乾糖袋三元、荳藍綫袋二元三角、印度蔴袋綫每千磅二千九百兀、叉蔴袋布二千元、國產原機布每千疋二千二百兀、又扁絲布二千一百五十元、惟杭綠蔴近有到貨、價格較宜、每件爲一百四十元、（岩）</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球無再漲望</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日來因天氣和暖、銷塲淸淡、同業廠盤甚爲穩定、且煤屑來貨源源不斷、下月份船隻、亦已扣定、自無匱乏之虞、加之目前南市某煤球廠成立同業自車、每噸兩百七十五元、故租界各廠、亦起競爭、暗盤稍回、大廠貨兩百九十二元、小廠便宜七八元不等、最近期內、自無復漲之理、日昨某報盛傳煤球批拆又俏新聞、是亦空中樓閣、查非事實、</p>
<h3>雜項　肥皂更貴</h3>
<p>日常用品、如肥皂漲勢頗健、各方需要暢達、賣出寥寥、執貨不肯輕易脫售、市氣愈趨緊俏、致價飛騰不己、昨市做開如固本皂每箱　售至五十一元五角、白祥茂皂每　四十七元五角，黃祥茂皂每箱四十一元、剪刀皂每箱四十元〇五角、買價均較上週挺秀、</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵　一漲一平</h3>
<p>二十六號與二十四號之美大馬口鐵、因廠方採辦見弱、其他銷路亦無多大進展、故市象殊覺岑寂、唯因海外來貨絕跡、因而執貨者心思依然高昂、其中二十四號花色因昔日市價所漲過厲、故實銷更稀、標準亦呆、二十六號貨、因　價蚊廉、故多有問津行情步步告升、昨如廿四號每箱售一千二百元、（比前不相上落）、二十六號每箱則喊丸百五十元、較之前市漲起五十元左右、</p>
<h3>毛巾（續）</h3>
<p>— 郭秀石</p>
<p>印花毛巾，種類頗多，一種是印在毛巾的中心，－即起毛頭之部份－一種是印在毛巾兩端的平布上，也有的織着顏色紗的格子，條子等的毛巾，冉加上印花的；也有的在毛巾四週圍，印着細小的花朶：普遍的印花毛巾。都是單面印的，精細的出品，則有雙面印的，極為精美。</p>
<p>印花毛巾，需要準備的有三個步驟：第一，要花式新穎，第一，耍地位選擇適當，第三，要顏色調配得融洽！吾則，就要失却「美」的條件。織花毛巾，雖則織着顏色紗的格子，條子等花紋，看起來好像很是簡單，但是也欲把顏色紗搭配得得當，那末，才能够稱得起「美」，能够惹人滿意，歡喜，要是把顏色紗搭配得小適當，那末，即爲「俗氣了。</p>
<p>洗面毛巾，提花的很少，惟毛巾布料，與浴巾，床巾，等則很多提花的，故花式較多</p>
<p>毛巾布料，以裁製浴巾，睡衣爲多，無奈這種布料，花式雖多，顏色雖美麗，但是，它所用的顏料，很多爲不能洗滌的，落水退色，豈非美中不足！又因而失却信用，這點，希望織造工廠，改革爲要，－完－</p>
<h3>紗廠受電力影響　非大量减工不可</h3>
<p>自電力公司緊急措施，決定於本月廿四日起（廿四日後抄表之决日起。）實行新緊急限制，凡用戶消費電量，超過一千度者，將照六倍鬣價取費的嚴厲辦法公布後，首當其衝的，無疑是輕工業的紡織廠，須知每一萬的紡錠，每個月消耗電量，須十萬度個字以上，五萬紡錠以上的紗廠，每小時需用電一，〇〇〇啟羅沃脫，一畫夜（廿四小時）工作，電耗二四，〇〇〇字，一個月做二十八天工作計算，（除去星期夜四十八小時），共須用電六十七萬餘字，戰前，（八一三前）每字馬達電價是國幣二分，有五寓紡錠以上的紗廠，月須付電費一萬三四千元，平均每月紗的生產量，以三千五百包而論，（每萬錠出價一磅計。）每包紗的電力開繳，在三元六七角之間；如果再加詳細的分析。前面說過，一畫夜的工作，耗電二四，〇〇〇字，估以五萬錠計算，每萬錠須用電四，八〇〇字，電費每一字價二分，（戰前）共需　費國幣九十六元，（即每一紡錠須電費九厘六，亦即每磅紗雷費負擔）。</p>

<p>距今五十年前，西洋來華傳道的敎會機關裏的醫帥，組織了一個「　醫曾」，由外人主持全中國的醫學事宜，如促進醫學敎育，改良醫學設施，灌輸衛生知識等等，替吾國奠下了新醫的基石。有識之士，便紛紛　究西洋新醫　術，民衆也漸知延請西醫診治疾病；於是西洋醫術便在吾國萌起了嫩芽。當時從外國學成歸國的醫界先進，認爲中國的醫學事業由外國人主持，他們的精力和功績，固然値得感佩，但究非妥善辦法，國人應有自己的醫學團體，中國的醫學事業，應由中國人來主持，於是使組織了中國醫學會，到現在巳有將近三十年的歷史了。自從中國醫學會成立後，外人組織的博醫會即形解散，外國醫學家仍極力贊助中國醫學會的　成。到現在巳有三千會員，其中有六百個外國會員。這是全國的醫學學術　關，在政府極力贊助之下，對於吾國醫　事業貢獻良多。該會的會址，就在上海池洪路四十一號。</p>
<p>中華醫　會裹搜藏着很豐富的吾國　代醫　文獻，有中國古醫學的圖照，模型，偶像，醫具，醫學書籍等等。據中華醫史學會會長王吉民氏說，中國醫學書籍以中國醫學會搜藏最當，常有中醫界的人士前往借閱查考。這些古醫學的文獻，都是王氏逐年搜羅聚藏起來，並曾加以一番考設過的。</p>
<p>當歐陽忠博士伴我在道兩間醫學博物室裹巡視一過之後，我的腦海裹浮起了中國醫學史的一個輪廓。</p>
<p>在樓上一間小室裹，四週壁上掛着醫學史上重要的人像和圖案。有一幅中外醫學史的比較，自從我國黃帝作內經興起醫道，神　嘗百草得有醫樂　（紀元二千四百年前），直釗五行（紀元前一千年）八卦（紀元前五百年）之醫理，迄乎漢朝的張仲景，華陀（耶穌降生時代），中國的醫道於焉大與。漢朝的張仲景是吾國內科聖手，　有傷寒論，至今奉爲國醫經典。華陀曾爲三國名將關羽括骨療骨，是我國用　醉法醫療之首創，成爲吾國外科宗師。另一個鏡框內是一張消代名醫葉天士的處方眞跡。他以治瘟疫著名，用辛寒以開閉，芳香以驅穢濁，是我國治疫之祖。一張明朝李時珍像，他費廿七年工夫，完成中國空前的醫學巨著「本草綱目」，是我國醫學之大成。此外又有一張所謂「掛綫脈」的畫圖，圖中畫一個「大夫」和幾名丫嬛。丫嬛手裹牽着一根綫，「大夫」在綫上按脈，診察病情。因爲吾國古代爲舊禮敎所束縛，在男女授受不親的規律下，一位閨閣小姐倘使不幸生了病，她是不能把她的潔白的肌膚顯露給醫生看的，她的織嫩的玉臂是不能給醫生把脈的，於是在頑固的頭腦裹想出了一個聰明的辦法。便用一條絲綫，由一個丫嬛把綫的一端緊按在患病小姐的玉臂上脈膊的一部份，把綫的另一端由另一丫環携着引到臥房外室，醫生便在道條綫的中間按脈，綫隨脈膊的跳動而微微跳動，醫生便根據錢的跳動診斷病情，對症處方用藥。醫生根本沒有見到這位病了的小姐究竟病得怎樣玉容憔悴呀。這種「掛綫脈和另一種女子裸體模型的診療法同一性質。假如一位小姐身體某一部份患了病，便在這種裸體模型上，由病人家屬指給醫生看，然後醫生根據所指枚型上的息病部份用藥。古代女子生了病，便這樣隔靴搔癢地給醫好了。（未完）</p>

<p>自由談社會捐血會  郭洪迪　　人類的身上甚麼東西最寶貴？答案也許各小相回，不過「血液是人身上一件最寶貴的東西」這句話，恐怕沒有人會加以反對的吧。　　人們向來把血看做犧牲的象徵，因此烈士的血往往被人追念不忘，而耶穌基督的寶血終於使基督敎傳佈將近二千年而不衰，這可見人類對於血的重視了。　　有一决，美國康奈特葛州的小村中，有一個女人病勢沉重，被送到城中的醫院裹去救治。因爲需要輸血，所以就公開徵求，結果有二十二個人自動前來應微。這二十二個人爲了要輸血，在醫院裏等了整天，結果有十九人因爲血型小合落選。　　其中有一個人，名叫拿敦，覺得這個辦法太不經濟，於是就跟一位牧師商量，發起組織一個馬狄遜城的捐血會。一呼百應，參加捐血曾者源源不絕而來，他們祇收了六十人爲會員。汽車夫，敎員，學生，軍團團員，銀行會計員，各色人等，應有盡有。他們把血液抽了出來，存放在醫院裹的貯血銀行中，算是馬狄遜城全城人士的公共財產，遇到貧苦的病人需要輸血，捐血會就把血液捐助了出來。捐血會的會員，以他們的血液，使全城的民衆都成爲血親了。　　有些經濟情形比較好的病人，照常付了輸血的代價，他們便把這一筆存款儲蓄起來，作爲會員生病時的救急之用。　　其他各地不乏急公好義願意捐血的人士，這種捐血會也可以組織起來的。家庭弟弟有半大姊姊  陳文運　　我的弟弟今年還祗有四歲，他很聰明，而且很會說話，所以我們六個姐姐都很歡喜他。爸和媽也因連續的有了半打女兒，一旦在他們四十歲感到將達老年的時期，忽然得到了這位可作身後之靠的兒子，自然囉，特別寵愛，格外歡喜。　　媽媽說弟弟是她脚前的明燈；有時說弟弟像一盞照亮全家的五百支光的電燈。總之，她以爲弟弟是全家的救星。的確，情形如此。假使到現在，我還沒有弟弟，那麼爸爸一定會討小母親的，而况他有「不孝有三，無後爲大」的堂皇理由呢。幸而爸爸讀了些古書之類，他有忍耐的功夫，不大肯聽鄕里中年老多事者的勸告。他每决眼巴巴的看見媽媽肚子一天天高起來，又東去測字，西去算命，忙得不亦樂乎。結果害得他渴望了十個月的兒子夢，完全化爲鳥有，同時三妹四妹五妹六妹卻相繼而來，眞使他啼笑皆非。幸虧他很相信算命瞎子的話，知道自已命中該有兩個兒于，而且愈來得遲愈好，因此每富他失望時，他就把瞎子的話來安慰自己。　　大概是舊戲中常有行善得子一類的故事，所以爸就倣法起來，也是去救窮人，買米票，捐寒衣……。可巧弟弟的出世，正在他仃善之後，因此爸爸認爲弟弟必是犬上的星宿下凡無疑，吾則怎麼會這樣巧呢？於是他遇到了和他情形相同的朋友，就拚命的勸他們行善忍耐，更恐怕人家不信，就親身抱了弟弟去給人家看；因此凡是爸爸的朋友，都知道他有一個行善得來的兒子。他們都誇贊爸爸，允其是一些女太太，更是羨慕，這便造成了爸媽更愛弟弟的原因。　　但是我們呢？是不是因爸媽的偏愛弟弟而妒嫉呢？這決不：不過我却漸漸的恨起弟弟來了。不是說弟弟不好，你看，他多可愛，常常叫我姐姐：用小手給我吻。然而我所恨的，乃是由爸媽的溺愛所造成嬌生慣養的脾氣和習慣。雖然他還祇四歲，年紀還小，但是從這時起，正是記憶能在他腦中刻畫痕跡的時候；他那光潔優良的腦子，正待着技術高尚的匠工，刻上那有用的痕跡。然而現在呢？一開頭就在他的腦中，留下了不良的痕跡，將來如何去洗刷呢？　　我常聽到弟弟的小口中發出：「姐姐是女人，寶賣是男人，男人做老闆，賺銅鈿，坐汽車……你們女人沒有。」接着他學着做了老闆的得意樣子，引得媽媽也笑了，拍拍弟弟的肩說：『寶寶賺來的錢給媽媽用，不要給妻子用，女人最不好……』這樣一决叉一决，在弟弟幼小的腦中，知道了只有駡女人，媽總是說他好；以後他去打六妹，媽反說女人應當給男人打。吃東西時，媽說兒子應多得一份；這使弟弟知道了重男輕女的惡思想，養成了驕傲自居的態度。家中的人，誰也不收侵犯他。　　他用小拳頭去打爸，爸笑着說他的拳頭大，將來可去打下人：他用小脚去踢媽，媽反誇他說這是做老闆的派頭。他駡人說他聰明，他打人說他能幹，所以自從他出世至今，這短短四年來，巳學會了打人，駡人，驕傲，看輕女人，下人……種種少爺壞脾氣了。　　我雖曾勸告過爸媽，不要太放縱了他，但是他們說：「要你管什麽？女兒總是外面人，在家壓得緊，將來出去做人家媳婦才死心肯吃苦。兒子是自家人，祖宗有積德，墳塲有風水，去管他什麼？怕他曾變到怎樣壞嗎？他是有來根，前世修過的，你自己管好自己吧！不要做出丟弟弟的臉的事就是了！」倒反而討了一塲敎訓。　　不過我仍是愛弟弟的，也爲了愛弟弟的緣故，所以恨他，同時更替他可惜；然而我沒有辦法去救弟弟。只希望爸媽能早日醒悟，將弟弟改造成一個有用的兒子，一個對於大衆有用的兒子。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　（七）臉上劃一個十字　　這一天早上，秋海棠找到他那裏去的時候，他就在那張木榻上散手散脚的躺着，沉濁的鼾聲裹，不斷的在噴散出一陣陣濃烈的酒氣來　　「老二，醒一醒行不行？」　　儘管在睡熟的時候，機伶的人還是機伶的；秋海棠只輕輕地喊了他一聲，玉崑醒過來了。但當秋海棠把來意說明之後，他却大大的不以爲然起來。　　「這有什麽大驚小怪的？我統共祇睡了四個鐘頭，便給你巴巴的趕來鬧醒了！」他一面把敞開着的短掛扣起來，一面很着惱地說。　　秋海棠背着雙手，在屋子裹來來回回的踱着，只當沒有聽見一樣，讓玉崑一路埋怨他，一路洗臉換衣服。　　「因爲這傢伙一直總是向我低聲下氣的死纏，今天突然這樣硬起來，好像抓到了什麼把柄似的，所以我要急着趕來向你商量一下了！」這屋子裹倒眞是乾乾凈凈的連半個櫈子都沒有，秋海棠每决來，不是滿屋子亂走，便是像現在這樣的靠在門框上，稍微讓身子沾到一些東西。　　「老兄弟，這有什麽急的？」玉崑最後才拉上了一雙已經長着眼睛嘴巴的布底鞋後跟，做出準備耍出門的樣子。「今兒或是明天，先派幾個人去向他送一個信，敎他安靜些，便什麽事也沒有了！」　　仗着他的玩藝兒，說話靈巧，化起錢來也相當爽快的便宜，在天津住不了三年，不但吃戲飯的同行，背地裹都在誇讚他，便是街上幾個有頭臉的混混，也沒有一個不說草上飛趙二老板是一條漢子；所以像季兆雄那樣一個狗仗人勢的馬弁，以及他所結交的那些無名少姓的小流氓，在玉崑看來，的確是不値介意的。（八九）珍聞食物銀行  新亮　　我們大家都知道，銀行抵是一種存放與提取金錢的機關。豈知在今日的美國，更有一種新型的「食物銀行」與我們相見。據統計，去年的有一百萬個家庭利用這種奇怪的銀行。在物價使宜的時候，他們就把牛肉，豬肉，豆類，蔬菜與橘子汁等東西存進去，直到要吃的時候再去提出來。這種「食物銀行」在美國巳有五年歷史，全部資金巳達三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇金元：對於人民的生活亦有莫大裨益。　　「食物銀行」的創始，雖脫胎於從前的那種冷藏房，但我們切勿把它與古老的冷藏法混　一談。劇熱與此道的專家吿訴給我們：老法的冷藏，食物被保持在零度上是會慢慢地凍結起來，而終於桑失原來的鮮味的。「食物銀行」所採取的。幷退。一食物銀行」所採取的，幷不是這種方法，而是一種高速度的凝凍法。因爲冰晶的大小是與它凝結時的速度成正比例的緣故，凝凍得愈快，所結的冰晶亦愈小，冰晶愈小，食物的細胞體就不會破裂，而它的色，香，味也就可以保持原狀，一些不受影響。「食物銀行」的規模，有大有小，有幾家簡直就可以叫做「巨型的」，一切設備都屬流綫型。　　「食物銀行」除了可以保持食物原來的品質外，還有一種好處，就是對於多餘的東四，有了一個貯藏的處所了。農夫們所收穫的食物，不必一定要統統賤價賣給商人，而讓商人們區國積居奇。他們可以把賣不完　下的東西，暫時挪去放在銀行里，那邊有很好的房間冰箱，把它們收藏起來，待價錢上漲時再去提取。　　如此說來，一般農夫的收入當較現在的大些，他們就可以利用這些額外的進益，來添置幾件新衣裳，或買幾本新書雜誌。　　這種新型事業，還可以調劑我們每天的食譜。當外面菜塲里已經購不到某種時鮮時，因爲有這種銀行存在，我們可以預先存放些在內，等到要吃的時候去挪出來。　　到了一個國家發生戰爭的時候，這種銀行的功勞是更加大了。我們可以在那里面貯藏大批軍糧食物，以備沿海各口岸被封鎖時應用。截至一九四〇年年底爲止，美國的「食物銀行」巳不下四千餘家；我相信：「食物銀行」的機能與功效，將在最短期內大大地發揮出來了。</p>

<p>游藝界菊苑談片郭坤泉與袁小樓  洪達　　一個人有幸有不幸的，唱戲的常不能例外，像北方的李萬春，楊盛春，李少春，高盛麟，那一個不是矮子，可是他們每一個都有相當的號召力。南方武生中有郭坤泉袁小樓二人，因爲生得矮小，一輩子不會紅過，講到他們的藝術功夫，那一樣比不上北方幾位紅武生呀！　　郭坤泉是郭秀華之孫，郭蝶仙之哲嗣，是伶工世家。坤泉童年，藝名郭張揚，「伐子都」，「界牌關」，「金刀陣」，「越虎城」，「九江口」，可以說齣齣都拿得出，其中「伐子都」的飛劍還劍，是百無一朱的絕活，（北方茹富蘭李盛斌只能飛劍，不能還劍，還劍者是飛出之劍，仍能自動入劍盒。）雖然也曾登過舞臺，但是輾轉還是回到遊藝塲裹，鬻藝之餘，兼爲票友說戲，近况當然不怎麼好。　　袁小樓是袁北風之後，也是伶工子弟，中華圖書館出版的戲考上，刊有一七八歲童伶攀朝天櫈的照片，這張照片傷的童伶就是袁小樓。就這張照片來看，袁小樓幼　的深高，是任何童伶所不及的。袁小樓的戲內爲限於身材，以短打和箭衣爲出色，長靠戲我看過他「伐子都」，金殿的跌撲，比一個前撲出桌子成名的應寶蓮更火爆。北方李盛斌雖然也以這齣戲出名，可是講功夫就遠不如袁小樓。袁小樓身手之敏捷，腰腿之靈活，上彩之得法，吐彩之淸楚，看了處處曾叫人欽佩。其他如「周瑜歸天」，「湯懷自刎」，「盤腸大戰」，「殺四門」，「長板坡」都値得一看。在老大舞事我還看過他爲小達子余少山李萬　配「打金磚」之姚剛，觔斗之妙，鎚花之繁，身手之利落，飾牛毛之李萬春，爲之失色。後來又在黃金看他唱「走麥城」之關平，驚人的地方太多了。我看過李萬春梁慧超都曾爲李洪春配過這齣戲中的關平，翻摔都不及袁小樓火熾；水髮，跪步，坐子，圓塲，更不如袁小樓來得見功夫，現在他也淪落到遊藝塲裹，可惜呀！　　郭坤泉袁小樓如果生在北方，我敢說決不會到目下地位，他們不幸長大於上海，齊巧上海獨多高大身材的武生，（像應寶蓮，蓋玉庭，高雪樵，王英武，王虎辰都不是矮小的。）因此袁小樓和郭坤泉一輩紅不起來了。二度蜜月  李杜　　狄安娜寶萍和馮保羅的結婚，事先甚囂塵上，據好萊塢電影雜誌的記載，原是要等到本年六月九日才舉行的。可是，不知怎樣一來，他們倆竟迫不及待，而提早結婚了。　　寶萍最愛音樂，這决是在禮拜堂裹結婚的。據實萍對人表示，她之所以要在禮拜堂結婚，就是愛聽那莊嚴的婚禮進行曲。那天奏琴的，是曼德爾遜和溫格奈二人，輪流交替，奏兩决進行曲，有羞極靜穆的調子。　　不知是迷信還是個人的嗜好，寶萍在婚後，也要來兩决蜜月。第一個蜜月預備到火奴魯魯去住上六個月，這和她在It’s　Date的情形差不多。從火奴魯魯回來之後，再要到紐的區旅行一次。在那裹，她預備去欣賞舞臺上的歌劇。　　馮保　在宣佈和她結婚時送給她的禮物，是一只精緻的寶石鑽戒，一只手鐲。她的訂婚戒，也是馮保羅送的，不過比較小些。婚後馮保羅送她的第一件禮物，是一只手表。力行的哲學提要  宗預　　動是生的源，生是動的果。誰離開了動，誰沒有前途。因爲不動則不生，不生便要消滅，這是鐵一般的萬應律。所謂不生不寂，超出了動的範圍，求他的存在，不過是一種幻想！　血雨瓊葩  頋明道　　第七章　攻城殺將何紛紛　　伊便和李信殺出衍署，又放起一個信砲，聚集　兒郎正要衝殺出城，只聽西邊街道上嗚嗚地一片號筒之聲，跟着火把大明，人馬雜沓，原來馮遊擊聞得刦獄的惡耗，召集部下前來兜捕了。李信對紅娘子說道：「官兵殺來，我們走向那裏去？」紅娘子道：「不用心慌，待我來抵擋一陣，我哥哥的人馬也快來了。」二人說話間，官兵已從對面巷裹衝至。杞縣的街道卞分狹隘，沒有迥旋之地，兩邊都已瞧見。馮遊擊是一員少壯將軍，全副戎裝，騎下一匹黃驃馬，手執大砍刀。見了對面一夥靑石山上的盜匪，持械列隊，他就大喝一聲，催動坐下馬，直向這邊衝來。紅娘子挺劍迎住，嬌喝一聲「紅娘子在此」！馮遊擊平時也聞紅娘子的大名，且知伊常穿紅衣，勇悍絕倫。現在火光下見殺來的女子，雖然姿色甚美，而身上却穿的黑衣，心裹似乎有些小信·但聽伊自稱紅娘子，也就不敢怠慢，舉起大刀，照準伊頭上劈下·紅娘子豈肯饒讓，舞創　馮遊擊往來狠鬥·馮遊擊部下的官兵跟着殺上，李信和兒郎們上前接住，兩下裹巷戰起來。馮遊擊的武藝很好，但因巷戰的關係，苦無馳騁的地步。紅娘子身手便捷，一口劍使得十分矯捷，忽在　前，忽在馬後，累得馮遊擊滿頭是汗，方知紅娘子三字果然名不虛傳了。李信也將朴刀使開身手，刺倒了三四個官兵。正在相持之際，城外撲通撰通的放起三個信砲，早有人來馮遊擊軍前報告，說靑石山上大隊人馬己殺到杞縣城外，城上兵少，乏人把守，城門即將被奪。馮遊擊得到這個消息，他不知靑石山上來了多少兒郎，城裹也有，城外也有，心中好不慌亂，虛晃一刀，同馬便走。紅娘子回顧李信，帶笑說道：「我哥哥來了，我們快些掩殺上去，趁勢取下這個杞縣城。」　（四六）棋苑  莆田連學正編　　第二八九局　馳車使砲　俞登榮擬　紅先勝　　　　第二八八局「强秦壓楚」着法列下　（紅先勝）　　卒六進一　　將五退一　　車五進一　　砲六退四　　馬三進二　　砲九退八　　馬五進七　　將六退一　　馬五　三　　士五退四　　車六平五　　將六進一　　馬六退五　　將六退一　　馬三退三　　將元平六　　馬六退五　　（勝）　　車六進三　　將五平六　　馬七退六　　將六平五　　馬二進三　　將六進一　　馬七進六　　砲五進一　　將五進一　　卒二平三　　將六進一　　馬五進三　　馬九退七　　馬三退五　　砲九平五　　車三進一　　車六退一　　象五退七　　車五平四　　將五平六　　砲一進五　　將六平五　　車三進七　　將六進一影城近事  夏莎　　在I　Wauted　Wings中，有幾幕鏡頭是很危險的，這是一張偉大的空戰片，主演的威廉霍登和溫毛立　都被全身塗上了防火炙傷的油液，化裝是由好萊塢最著名的化裝專家馬克思佛陀負責的。　　蓓蒂戴維絲在她的新片「撒謊女人」（The　Great　Lie）中扮演一個世界上最最悽慘的孤女，有幾幕痛哭的塲面，在拍的時候的確使她在第二天不能上攝影塲工作去，因爲眼睛的神經太疲乏了呀。這張片子恐怕又要賺得小少觀衆的熱淚了。</p>

<h3>Favorable Retreat of Chinese Troops; Fierce Fighting Continues Along Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts; Bitter Fighting Day and Night Between Two Armies Near Yongjia and Fuzhou; Japanese Troops Invading Zhuji Blocked at Yokoyama Village</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News: The war situation on the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts is fierce. (1) The Japanese troops invading westward from Lianjiang and Changmen were fiercely resisted by Chinese troops at Changting and Meiyang, suffering significant losses. The Japanese then reinforced with 5,000 to 6,000 troops under the cover of multiple aircraft and artillery fire, launching a fierce attack westward. On the 21st, they entered the county seat of Minhou, where Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat throughout the night. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. By dawn on the 22nd, the Chinese troops withdrew from the city and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese in the suburbs. (1) A portion of the Japanese troops in Yongjia invaded Baiyan yesterday, where fierce fighting is ongoing. (2) On the 21st morning, Japanese troops in Taizhou divided and invaded the border areas of Tiantai and Xianju. One group invading the Tiantai border was repeatedly repelled by Chinese troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese.

(5) The Japanese troops surrounded near Shierdau have suffered heavy losses, with half of their force killed or wounded. The Chinese are continuing to intensify their attacks. The Japanese troops in Yingdian Street have repeatedly moved south, launching fierce attacks on the Chinese in an attempt to rescue the besieged Japanese, but they have all been bravely repelled by the Chinese. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Telegram from a Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: The Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting on the south bank of the Qiantang River. At dawn on the 19th, the Japanese again invaded Shuangcun from the southwest of Fengqiao. The Chinese troops met them with a fierce counterattack, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. On the 20th, 60 to 70 Japanese aircraft and numerous artillery pieces provided cover for the fighting. The Chinese fought fiercely with the Japanese until noon, and in order to secure their main force, they retreated to a more favorable location. After the Japanese occupied Zhuji, they continued to launch a fierce attack on Jinji Mountain south of Zhuji, but they have been blocked by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops invading Yingjiadian from Fuyang continued to invade the area near Shierdau south of Yingjiadian at dawn on the 20th, where they were surrounded by Chinese troops. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing Military News: On the 21st, the Japanese troops in Zhuji continued to divide into groups and invade southward. One group invaded Yokoyama Village (southeast of Zhuji) in the afternoon, where they were met with a counterattack by Chinese troops. The fighting was fierce until night, with many Japanese killed. They are currently locked in a stalemate. Another group invaded Meihuatan Village and Xucun via Sanjiajing Market but was blocked by Chinese troops and made no progress. Two groups invaded Pai Tau Town (south of Zhuji) along the railway line via Waichen, but they were all repelled by the Chinese. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: Fierce fighting continues on both banks of the Min River estuary. On the south bank of the Min River, Chinese troops are advancing towards the suburbs of Changle, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese. On the north bank of the Min River, the Japanese suddenly attacked Lianjiang. On the 21st, a portion of the Japanese troops invading westward were blocked by Chinese troops near Changting, west of Lianjiang. Another group of Japanese troops invaded westward via Weimen and Lingtou, where they were blocked by Chinese troops near Meishan, west of Lianjiang, suffering significant losses.

<p>A Telegram from a Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: On the afternoon of the 21st, a portion of the Japanese troops invading Yongjia from Ruian attacked Tanxi Village, northwest of Yongjia, but were met with a heavy counterattack by the Chinese and made no progress. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing News: Intelligence sources announced today that one week after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese pact, Japanese forces had launched an offensive in Zhejiang and Fujian with the purpose of signaling to the world and reassuring the Japanese populace that the treaty had enabled Japan to intensify its efforts to end the war with China. However, it is not believed that Japan can end the war with such landing operations, as the number of participating Japanese troops is not large and they were certainly dispatched to the area before the treaty was signed. The Japanese troops participating in this offensive are a special landing force previously deployed in Vietnam and Guangdong. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese aim is to induce foreign parties concerned in China to believe that Japan's next major offensive will be directed against China rather than Southeast Asia. However, it is pointed out that Japanese movements are highly fluid. After establishing a small garrison, troops can be withdrawn to Southeast Asia at any time. The intelligence sources declared that the Japanese action is intended to solidify their base for southward advance. They pointed out that Japanese occupation of such port cities would prevent any third country at war with Japan later on from utilizing these ports. They also pointed out that Japanese forces have occupied numerous Chinese airfields in the area. These airfields, if not occupied, could be used to disrupt Japan's lines of communication to Southeast Asia. Japan can also utilize these ports as a stepping stone for southward advance. Chinese sources with intelligence indicate that the Japanese forces participating in this coastal offensive consist of approximately four divisions. The troops advancing south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway are regular forces, but other units stationed at Zhenhai, Ningbo, Shipu, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou are specially trained landing forces. This force was used in the landing operation in Vietnam last year and more recently along the coast of Guangdong. Since these coastal ports currently have no regular forces, Chinese sources with intelligence suspect that these other Japanese units intend to penetrate inland from the coast. They pointed out that these landing forces typically withdraw shortly after a new style landing. However, permanent garrisons may be established in the important seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian. After the landing forces occupied the seaports, regular troops, numbering slightly over one division, advanced southward from Hangzhou, Fuyang, Xiaoshan, and Shaoxing on the Qiantang River. It is believed that these Japanese troops are advancing towards Yiwu, an important transportation hub. The railway, which has been destroyed, is located 65 miles south of Hangzhou and 20 miles east of Jinhua, the temporary provincial capital of Zhejiang. The railway is still operational west of Jinhua. It is believed that the purpose of occupying Yiwu is to cut off transportation from the seaports north of Zhejiang and to prevent the Chinese from assembling a large force to drive the Japanese out of these ports. (23rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: After the Japanese occupied Fuzhou, everything remains as usual except for the suspension of electricity and outgoing mail. Electricity is expected to be restored today. It is now known that all foreigners are safe. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing Military News: (1) On the morning of the 18th, Japanese troops from Fankou and Changdian in southern Hubei gathered over 1,000 troops and invaded Fanhud, where they were met with a counterattack by Chinese troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (2) On the morning of the 13th, a portion of the Japanese troops at Zhaojun Tomb southwest of Baotou divided into multiple groups and invaded Hengmu by truck, where they were met with a counterattack by Chinese troops. The Japanese suffered losses and fled back. They then harassed Haiziwan but were repelled by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Unfolds Southeast of Xia County</p>
<p>Approximately 1,000 Japanese troops with ten artillery pieces stationed in the area of Erchunpo and Naoshang south of Jixian launched an attack at dawn on the 18th, dividing into separate forces to invade Shangxia Village and Ji Li Pu (southeast of Xia County). Fierce fighting has broken out with Chinese forces along the line from east of Shangxia Village to Xicun and in the area of Wangjia Yaotou and Yangjia Yaotou, and is currently ongoing.

<p>Japanese Troops in Wenchang Repeatedly Suffer Heavy Blows</p>

The Chinese then reinforced their troops, and after a long period of fierce fighting, they finally repelled the Japanese, inflicting heavy casualties on them. On the 5th, the Japanese again invaded Huadashan and Shanyuan, where they were ambushed by the Chinese. After fierce fighting until noon, the Chinese also used a portion of their forces to flank the Japanese, who were unable to withstand the attack and retreated.

<h3>The Focus of the European War is in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Reviewing the recent war situation on both sides of the Mediterranean, the Allies' situation is indeed not optimistic. The progress made by the British forces in North Africa during the past two months of winter has been completely lost in no time, and they have returned to the battle to defend Egypt. The Balkan war has been increasingly approaching Athens, and the so-called miracle of a victory in Thermopylae and Marathon is probably just a futile dream. The retreat of the British forces will be a matter of time. As the editorial of this newspaper pointed out yesterday, the Allies have never had the initiative in these two weeks of battles. Recently, there have been various disputes and justifications in the British government and public regarding the landing of German mechanized units in Libya and the deployment and withdrawal of British forces in Greece, indicating that the British military deployment in that area was indeed not entirely satisfactory. However, this does not necessarily mean that it was a flaw in the British deployment or a failure in strategy. In his speech to the Parliament on the 9th of this month, Churchill stated that "military strategy should not be complicated by considerations of face and public opinion." Judging from Churchill's view, the battles in Libya and the Balkans should be classified as a type where considerations of face and public opinion outweigh military value.</p>
<p>It would certainly not be true to say that the British do not attach importance to the battles on both sides of the Mediterranean, but they certainly do not consider it to be the focus of the war. According to the British authorities, the Atlantic is the real focus. In the same speech mentioned above, Churchill said: "We only need to win in the Atlantic war and ensure the continuous input of supplies from the United States, and no matter how Hitler progresses, we will eventually be able to control his fate." This passage expresses the British's main belief and direction, and it also explains the British's view of various competitions outside the Atlantic. The progress of the Nazis in the European continent and the control of the Balkans is certainly not entirely preventable by the British, and the British authorities are unwilling to pay too much for this, so as not to hinder the preparation and implementation of the main battle. When the Balkan War was just expanding, some people suspected that the Germans might take advantage of the world's attention to the southern situation to suddenly launch a large-scale attack on Britain, because Hitler's main military force has always remained on the Western Front, and only a smaller part was used for the eastward advance. This groundless worry was fortunately not realized. At the same time, this is probably the reason why the British are unwilling to overemphasize the battles on both sides of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Now that the Balkan War is nearing its end, the next issue that the world is focusing on is of course the further movements of the Germans. Taking advantage of the victory in the Balkans, the Germans will move their troops eastward, attempting to encircle the oil fields in the Near East and the Suez Canal with a pincer offensive, which seems to be the natural trend of the German eastward route. However, it should not be forgotten that the Nazi's large-scale operations in the Balkans were originally a forced passive nature. According to their own intentions, they would rather hope to plunder peacefully and only block the path for the British forces to take advantage of the situation to penetrate. The German forces on both sides of the Mediterranean cannot be immediately imitated as the two wings of a pincer offensive. Although they are slightly similar in form, in substance, the Balkans is the main battle, while Libya is only a restraining effect. However, it was fortunate that the British's defense force was weakened, so they were able to advance quickly. Therefore, whether they will take advantage of the situation at this time to concentrate on the eastward advance is indeed a question. In terms of the strength of the British forces, it is not enough to stop the German's thunderous offensive in the Balkans. In terms of defending the oil fields in the Near East and the Suez Canal, the exertion of their joint sea and land combat strength seems to be more than enough. And the two wings of the German pincer each have their own military and political difficulties and shortcomings. The natural barrier of the Mediterranean and the Dardanelles, and the delicate position of the Soviet Union and Turkey, are all factors that are beneficial to the British and unfavorable to the Germans. Moreover, the German's lightning warfare expertise can only be fully exerted in the context of being close to the rear and with all kinds of convenient conditions. The deeper they advance, the less effective they become. The German mechanized units in North Africa were initially able to capture fortresses in succession within ten days, but they were eventually blocked at the Egyptian border, which precisely illustrates that the application of lightning warfare strategies has its own limitations.</p>
<p>If the above speculation is correct, then the future competition between the two sides will inevitably unfold in the Atlantic. Recently, the season has gradually warmed up, and even the storms in the English Channel are quieter than in winter, which is conducive to the conduct of this offensive war. In fact, even during the Balkan war, the Germans never neglected air and sea strikes in the Atlantic. According to a Reuters report from the British fleet on the 19th, "The Germans have shown signs of using their navy more extensively in the past few weeks than at any time since the start of the war." It is expected that this will only increase in the future. In any case, "Starving Britain" and "Preventing the arrival of British war equipment supplied by the United States under the Lend-Lease Act" should be the most pressing issues for Hitler. In recent days, the Germans have repeatedly pressured the Vichy French government and Spain. The Spanish government's recent increase in budget and repeated emergency cabinet meetings have attracted attention. The Vichy naval chief, Darlan, has also been shuttling between Vichy and Paris, seemingly replacing the previous role of Laval. Although this attempt by the Germans has been repeatedly frustrated in the past, the German victory in the Balkans has undoubtedly increased the weight of coercion on France and Spain. On the other hand, the economic pressure of Britain and the United States on Spain, and Petain's expression of benevolent neutrality, remain questionable as to how much they can resist the German pressure. This step by the Germans is naturally a prelude to the Atlantic War. If the war in Greece unfortunately comes to an end in the near future, then the focus of the war will immediately shift from the eastern Mediterranean to the western end. The British have long been waiting for this prospect with great vigilance and preparation.</p>
<p>Hitler can only have the hope of defeating Britain after winning in the Atlantic, and Britain can only consider a counter-attack against Germany after overcoming and suppressing the German offensive in the Atlantic. If the Balkan War ends only with the war in Greece, then it can largely maintain the nature of a local war without immediately affecting other corners of the world. It is expected that the future problem of the Atlantic will be difficult to be so simple. It is not only related to the victory or defeat of Britain and Germany, but also the key to the rise and fall of justice and violence in the entire world.</p>
<h3>Even If Japan Blocks All Seaports, It Cannot Sever China's Economic Lifeline; Various Inland Industries Have Already Established a Solid Foundation; Daily Necessities Have Almost Reached a State of Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to official sources, the Japanese troops landing on the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts are attempting to blockade all of China's seaports and sever China's economic lifeline, but this only shows their fruitless efforts. Because China's international routes, in addition to the two major highways in the southwest and northwest, which the Japanese can only see from afar, the inland industry has already established an unshakable foundation, producing a large amount of military supplies and daily necessities. The increase in production can be seen from the statistics published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the years 1937 and 1940. For example, the output of coal has increased from 3.6 million tons to 5.7 million tons, steel from 31,000 tons to 100,000 tons, brass from 400 tons to 1,000 tons, kerosene from 34,000 gallons to 440,000 gallons, alcohol from 1.8 million gallons to 4.5 million gallons, cotton yarn from 30,240 bales to 54,000 bales, flour from 1.71 million bags to 3.4 million bags, soap from 99,000 boxes to 309,000 boxes, matches from 7,000 boxes to 11,700 boxes, and paper from 600 tons to 1,800 tons. Among them, the two items of cotton yarn and paper only refer to the output of factories, and handmade products are not included. In summary, it can be seen that in the three and a half years of the war, the output of military supplies and daily necessities in the rear has increased by at least 60% and at most three times. The increase in the output of electrical appliances, machinery, and chemicals is also the same. Not only that, the National Resources Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is also actively developing heavy industry. There are currently 71 units of heavy industry that have been established or are under construction, including factories, mines, and power plants. At the same time, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee of the Ministry has also lent out large sums of money to subsidize private factories. Therefore, the daily necessities required by Free China have almost reached a state of self-sufficiency. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>China is Making Every Effort to Support Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese people from all walks of life here are currently discussing China's future policies due to the rapid development of the Balkan war situation. It is deeply believed here that no matter what changes occur, China will make every effort to support democratic countries. It is believed here that not only is the fate of China closely linked to the fate of democratic countries, but in principle, China must also stand on the side of democratic countries. This morning's editorial in Ta Kung Pao said, "We do not want to just talk empty words. What the Jin people want is to seek truth from facts. China's future foreign policy is obviously an important event, but we should not discuss it from the observation point of past foreign relations, because until now, the foreign relations of all countries have been based on self-interest. The harm that Britain has suffered today is mostly due to this. In view of the rapid development of the current international situation, China's future foreign policy must go a step further or be more active in nature. We must shoulder the responsibility, and we must not only seek help from others, but also assist others. Today, there are only a few independent countries left besides the countries in South America, namely the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, Japan, Italy, and China. China's independence is closely related to the future happiness of all mankind. The task of the United States is particularly important, because its resources are much richer than those of Germany, Italy, and Japan. No matter what defeats Britain suffers, its navy and its territories spread around the world are still important factors. Moreover, the United States will always cooperate closely with Britain. Britain and the United States must take the protection of small and weak nations as their purpose, because all the nations that the Axis powers want to conquer are those that Britain and the United States are trying to maintain. This war cannot be called an imperialist war. The Soviet Union's so-called policy of peace aims not to participate in the current war, but under the current situation, no one can guarantee that the Soviet Union will not be attacked, but we should know that if the Soviet Union is attacked, it will definitely not come from Britain or the United States."

<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Railway Can Be Completed Within Two Years; The Entire Route is 650 Miles Long; The Cost Will Exceed 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway began in December 1938, there has been a shortage of rails and construction materials, and the progress of the project has been quite slow. At the same time, it is also difficult to recruit road workers, and the prevalence of miasma has caused many deaths among the workers, which has repeatedly delayed the project. Now, the Chinese government has issued railway bonds worth 10 million US dollars to be sold to Overseas Chinese in the United States in order to purchase a large number of materials in the United States and expedite the completion of this road. The work of selling bonds and purchasing materials has already begun. If the supply of materials is continuous, then the road is expected to be completed within two years. The total length of the road is 650 miles, of which 120 miles are in Burma and 530 miles are in China. Several sections have already been completed. The original construction cost was set at 100 million legal tender, but it is expected that it will definitely exceed this number in the future. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing – The new Foreign Minister, Guo Taiqi, will return to China via England and the United States, and is expected to arrive in New York tomorrow. According to reliable information, Minister Guo will stay briefly in Washington and New York and is expected to arrive in Chongqing in late May to assume his new post. The government has internally decided to transfer the current Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, to succeed him as Ambassador to the UK. The position of Ambassador to France has also been internally decided to be filled by Wei Daoming, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. Currently, approval is being sought from the British and French governments, and an announcement will be made soon (Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador de Borchgrave Will Go to Chengdu</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Belgian Ambassador de Borchgrave is scheduled to travel to Chengdu for sightseeing within the next week. The L'Impartial newspaper published an article this morning stating that the ambassador has been stationed in China for fourteen years and is a true friend of China (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Propaganda Issued by the Chinese Communists; Content Divided into Five Points</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Chinese Communists have issued propaganda from Yan'an, explaining their views on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. This paper believes that the Chinese Communists are not loyal to the National Government and are acting as apologists for Moscow. There is no doubt that this can be clearly seen from this propaganda. The content of the propaganda is divided into five points: (1) The Soviet-Japanese Pact is another great victory for Soviet foreign policy. Its significance lies first in consolidating peace on the Soviet Union's eastern front and ensuring the safe development of socialist construction. This production of peace and development is in the interest of the working people and oppressed nations of the world. (2) The Soviet-Japanese Pact has greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's international status. Whether in the East or in the West, it has increased its power. Although this is unfavorable to all reactionaries, it is beneficial to all peace-loving people and oppressed nations. (3) The Soviet-Japanese Pact does not restrict the Soviet Union from assisting China in its independent and righteous war of resistance against Japan. As long as the Chinese government uses Soviet aid to oppose Japanese aggression, we are convinced that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China. Japan's intention to restrict Soviet aid to China has not been achieved. (4) The so-called Manchuria has long been used by Japan as a tool to disrupt the Soviet Union and the Mongolian border. The Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan incidents are proof of this. Now that the Soviet Union has signed a treaty of peace and neutrality with Japan, it cannot but resolve this issue in a timely manner. Based on its policy of peace and neutrality, the Soviet Union, regardless of the treaty, is not prepared to invade the four northeastern provinces, while Japan has repeatedly attempted to invade Outer Mongolia. However, Outer Mongolia has signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. Now Japan has declared that it will protect Outer Mongolia from aggression, which is not only beneficial to Outer Mongolia but also beneficial to China's struggle for liberation. As for the recovery of the four northeastern provinces, it is originally our own business. We must not think that the Soviet Union is wrong just because it has declared that it will not attack Manchuria. In fact, we must drive the Japanese troops out of China. This is a sacred cause of the entire Chinese nation, and the Soviet Union will certainly support it. (5) After the Soviet-Japanese Pact, China must persevere in the war of resistance, unite and progress. Any wavering in the war of resistance is not permitted. Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must continue. It is hoped that the National Revolutionary authorities will practice introspection and properly handle the current situation (Havas Telegraph from the 21st).</p>

<h3>Expressing Determination to Resist to the End; Greece Moves Capital to Crete; King Urges People to Fight for Final Victory; Declares Not Bound by Unilateral Agreements</h3>
<p>London – According to news received here, King George II of Greece has announced that Greece has abandoned Athens as its capital and the government has been established on the island of Crete (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>London – After the news of the surrender of Greek troops in Epirus and Macedonia reached the Greek capital, King George and the Greek government departed from Athens for Crete today. Before leaving, the King issued a proclamation to the people, refuting rumors of an armistice agreed upon by the Epirus Greek army, and stating that this matter would not bind the nation's determination to continue the struggle. According to current news from London, the new positions of the remaining Greek troops in other parts of Greece have not been breached, and the two armies are currently fighting hard.</p>
<p>The content of the King's proclamation to the people is as follows: The war has forced us and the legitimate government of Greece to leave Athens and move the capital to Crete. The determination of the entire Greek nation to continue the war of resistance has been repeatedly expressed. British troops have now come to our aid, have fought bravely, and are still fighting in Greek territory. We and the government have not heard of the armistice agreed upon when the Epirus troops surrendered, and we do not know under what circumstances this agreement was signed, but this action cannot bind the nation's people and government's determination to continue the war of resistance. The King finally appealed to the people not to feel discouraged but to trust in the justice of the principles they uphold and in the protection of Heaven. Although they must go through trials, suffering, and danger, they will ultimately achieve final victory (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Twenty Thousand Greek Troops Surrender Unconditionally</h3>
<p>Rome – The Italian Supreme Command issued a war report stating, "The Greek troops in the Epirus and Macedonia regions dispatched a delegation to the command of the Italian Eleventh Army on the front line at 9:15 last night to surrender unconditionally. Our side immediately consulted with the German command and, with their full agreement, finalized the surrender procedure of the enemy troops." Further news: The Greek delegation included a colonel staff officer and two other officers, who, led by a white flag, personally went to the Italian army command to meet the Italian commander. They were escorted by several Italian officers to meet the commander of the Eleventh Army and present their surrender (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Berlin – Military experts here estimate that the Greek troops in Epirus and Macedonia who surrendered totaled between sixteen and eighteen divisions, no less than 250,000 men (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Berlin – It is difficult to calculate the exact number of Greek troops who surrendered in Epirus. It is believed to be several divisions. Epirus has an area of 9,552 square kilometers and a population of 350,000. According to the latest reports, the Greek troops in the area were surrounded by German troops before they surrendered. German mechanized units crossed the Pindus Mountains and occupied Ioannina, gaining not only the upper hand but also an absolute advantage, making it difficult for the enemy troops to resist (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Nazi Army Concentrated in Greece; Famous Mountain Passes Will Become Battlefields</h3>
<p>London – The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a message this morning stating that Germany has concentrated thirty divisions, one thousand bombers and fighter planes, and is preparing to launch a final offensive against the Allied forces in Greece (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>London – Military circles in Cairo stated last night that fierce fighting continued on land and in the air along the entire Greek front, but the German army did not exert any special pressure on any point of the British front. It is reported that fierce fighting is taking place south of Lamia, where British troops are holding the area leading into the Thessalian plain. Southeast of Lamia is the famous Thermopylae Pass, where the Spartans bravely resisted the Persians in 480 BC. After the Allied forces retreated to carefully selected positions, their positions have been greatly shortened. The location of the new front line has not been disclosed. The British army is fighting and retreating, maintaining close contact with the Greek army. Relations between the British and Greek armies are exceptionally good (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>New York – Yesterday, British and Greek Allied forces resisted the German advance at the Thermopylae Pass. The resistance by the Allied forces there and south of Mount Nassos may determine whether the Allied forces can conduct an unavoidable retreat smoothly. The front line is now less than ninety miles from Athens. Nazi bombers are continuously bombing the area, attempting to disrupt the orderly retreat of the Allied forces. According to reports from London, the front line from Thermopylae to the Gulf of Corinth is only forty miles long and can traverse the peninsula to establish a rearguard defense line. The effectiveness of the defense will depend on the weather. If Greece and its allies can hold off the German forces there, the historically famous Battle of Thermopylae will be repeated (Associated Press Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Heavy Price Paid by Germany for Invading Greece; Trains Full of Wounded Soldiers Pass Through Bulgaria</h3>
<p>London – According to a report from the Free French News Agency in Istanbul, visitors from Bulgaria have stated that trains full of German wounded soldiers are constantly passing through Sofia and Plovdiv. Bulgaria is continuing to requisition various materials for use by the German army (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Berlin – The German Supreme Headquarters stated that German troops have occupied Volos, the most important port on the eastern coast of Greece. For weeks, British supplies have been mostly routed through this port, and German planes have been bombing it continuously. The fall of this port was inevitable after the fall of Larissa. The spearhead of the German army is pushing due west, crossing the Pindus Mountains and occupying the Metzovo Pass, and has recently reached Ioannina, the most important city in the Epirus province, which is a road hub. It is rumored that the entire Greek army in Epirus has surrendered due to this blow, but there is no official confirmation. The German side also stated that because the German army advanced so quickly, the retreat of the Allied forces was extremely chaotic and on the verge of collapse. All passable roads were filled with troops and vehicles, and German planes were constantly bombing overhead. The British army fought hard in the rear while boarding ships, which the German side called the "Dunkirk of the Balkans." As for the German Supreme Headquarters' claim that six transport ships full of British soldiers were sunk by planes, if this is true, it is doubtful how many British soldiers could be rescued. The German side firmly denied claims of heavy losses, saying that this battle has resulted in fewer casualties than any previous battle. Yesterday afternoon, German newspapers published detailed reports of German mechanized troops advancing through the Olympus Pass (Associated Press Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Germany Claims to Have Occupied All of Thessaly; Retreating British Troops Repeatedly Attacked from the Air</h3>
<p>Berlin – It was revealed here last night that since German troops occupied Lamia on the 21st, they have continued to advance and are now only 210 kilometers from Athens. German troops are about to launch an offensive against the British-Greek Allied defense line after Lamia, on the opposite bank of the Spercheios River, where roads and railways lead to the Thermopylae Mountains. It is believed that the final British-Greek position is located there. All of Thessaly has now been occupied by German troops. The province has an area of 13,485 square kilometers and a population of 500,000. Before occupying Thessaly, German troops had already occupied Thrace and Macedonia. The former has an area of 8,585 square kilometers and a population of 300,000, while the latter has an area of 34,600 square kilometers and a population of 500,000. At the same time, Italian troops entered the Epirus province, forcing the Greek troops to retreat south. In total, half of the Greek territory and one-third of the population have already been conquered (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Berlin – German long-range reconnaissance planes reported yesterday that the docks and streets of various ports on the eastern coast of Greece are filled with large numbers of British troops preparing to board ships. There are many medium and small ships, all with their fires lit, ready to depart. German bombers are intensifying their attacks on various ports (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Berlin – Four British transport ships totaling 23,000 tons were sunk by German planes off the coast of Crete on Monday night. This shows that these transport ships had already left the port of Piraeus on the 19th (Haitong Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Reports on Military and Diplomatic Affairs in the House of Commons; Unwilling to Comment Much on the War Situation; Expresses Willingness to Maintain Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>London – The British House of Commons reopened yesterday after Easter. Prime Minister Churchill was asked to report on the war situation, but Churchill was unwilling to comment much at this time, saying that things are in progress and we must consider others besides ourselves. It would be inappropriate to hold a discussion at this time. It is hoped that the House of Commons will show more tolerance to those responsible for commanding the war and show the world its inherent calmness in difficult times. The war news he can now report is the British naval attack on the Italian colony of Tripoli in Africa on Sunday. The operation lasted for forty-two minutes, and the port and ships in the port were severely damaged. On the way back, British naval aircraft intercepted five German troop transport planes and shot down four of them. The fate of our aircraft is still unknown. The British warships suffered no losses. Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha rose to say that the House of Commons was extremely unwilling to interfere with the conduct of the war, but felt that an early debate was necessary. Australia has expressed anxiety due to a lack of accurate information. It seems appropriate to ask Foreign Secretary Eden to publish his report on his visit to the Middle East. Is it true that German troops have occupied Samothrace? Churchill replied that this may be the case, but he has not received direct confirmation. Regarding holding a debate, he will report to the House of Commons in detail when the situation becomes important. However, what he must now tell you is that we find it extremely difficult to obtain detailed reports on the arduous actions of the British troops in Greece. The deployment of British troops is extremely subtle and its nature is extremely complex. The government has not received daily intelligence from the commander. He has instructed the British commander to provide more detailed reports within the possible scope that does not hinder local military affairs. Churchill did not approve of the suggestion to ask Eden to speak at this time, as the information that could be presented was not yet complete. He also said that it would be detrimental to the House of Commons and the public to announce Eden's visit to the Middle East at this time. Conservative MP Southby asked the government to report on the military situation in Libya. Churchill replied that we know the military situation in Libya quite well, which is different from Greece. When the Prime Minister made this statement, someone interjected that Greece was more important. Churchill said that he did not think it appropriate to make comparative comments on the various dangerous duties undertaken by the British army, but he was not yet prepared to publish a report on the military situation in Libya. Labour MP Shinwell suggested a closed-door report to dispel existing anxieties. Churchill replied that the public is still calmly coping with everything and there is no sign of anxiety (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Loan to Spain Raises Questions</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the House of Commons yesterday afternoon in London, Labour MP Wedgewood criticized the recent British government loan to Spain. He said that the funds could go directly into Germany's pockets and asked if there was an opportunity to reverse this. Was the suggestion of Ambassador Hoare to Spain too expensive? Prime Minister Churchill replied that last year, many people thought that Spain would join the war against Britain. Later, thanks to the efforts of the British ambassador, British-Spanish relations were improved and have not deteriorated in this critical moment. Labour MP Bevan then said that the entire country was deeply disturbed by the delivery of the loan to Spain. Today, no Spanish newspaper has expressed a word of gratitude, nor have we heard any other words of thanks. The Prime Minister said that this policy had been given extremely careful consideration. We certainly do not want any action that could provide an excuse for the rupture of British-Spanish relations. We did indeed consider the starvation of the Spanish people and thought that Britain and the United States should cooperate to help them. Our action was in no way intended to ensure Spain's future gratitude to us. Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton replied to another question, saying that as far as he knew, there were no large shipments of iron ore being exported at this time. If the questioner had any information on this issue, he would be most welcome to share it (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Vienna Conference Ends; Italian Foreign Minister Returns to Rome; Germany Agrees to Release Bulgarian Prisoners</h3>
<p>Vienna – After repeatedly consulting with Führer Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the issue of the distribution of Yugoslav territory, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left here yesterday afternoon to return to Rome (International News Agency Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Sofia – After Bulgarian troops entered Thrace and Macedonia, it is expected that they will complete the occupation tomorrow. The administration of the two regions is currently being temporarily managed by the military authorities. All roads and bridges that were destroyed during the war have been repaired. In addition, the German Supreme Headquarters has decided to transfer Yugoslav prisoners of war who were originally Bulgarian to Bulgaria for release and return to their hometowns (Havas Telegraph from the 22nd).</p>
<h3>Over One Hundred Yugoslav Planes Land in Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>New York – The New York Post, citing Vichy dispatches, claims that 187 Yugoslav planes have landed in Soviet territory and are now flying to Greece (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>General Blamey Appointed Deputy Commander of British Forces in the Middle East; Iraq Declares Sovereignty Not to Be Violated; Allowing British Troops to Pass Through Is Stipulated by Treaty</h3>
<p>London – Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey, who commands the Australian troops in the Middle East, has been appointed Deputy Commander of all forces in the Middle East, serving as deputy to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Imperial forces in the Middle East. Blamey is 57 years old and commanded the Second Battalion of the Australian Expeditionary Force in France during the last Great War, earning great merit. Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who is currently here, announced the matter, saying that Blamey's handling of the troops fighting in Greece has been highly praised by General Wavell (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<p>Vichy – The French official news agency in Beirut reported that the Iraqi government issued a communique stating that allowing British troops to pass through Iraq is in accordance with the provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Iraqi government is now paying attention to its national rights and sovereignty and will not allow any infringement (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Seals Border with Germany; Vigilance Unremitting; Evacuates Border Residents</h3>
<p>Ankara – According to reliable sources received here, the Soviet authorities have begun to evacuate residents from an area 30 miles along the Soviet-German border. Large quantities of barbed wire and lumber have been transported to the area (Reuters Telegraph from the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Iran Vigorously Denies False Reports in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Vichy – Japanese newspapers have reported that relations between Iran and the Soviet Union are now very tense, and that Iran has deployed a large number of troops to the border between Iran and the Soviet Union for defense. The air route from the Iranian capital to Baku in the Soviet Union has been interrupted since April 15, and all Iranian roads leading directly to the Soviet border have been closed. This claim has been denied by the Iranian embassy in France, which said that the claim is completely unfounded. We have no military activity on the Soviet border, and the Soviet Union has no troops stationed in the border area (Havas Telegraph from the 22nd).</p>

<h3>The Axis Powers Launch a New Diplomatic Offensive on Two Fronts: From Moscow in the East to Madrid in the West, Seeking to Eliminate British Influence in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>A diplomatic correspondent for Reuters in London states that Germany has clearly launched another diplomatic offensive in the past few days, indicating that after succeeding in the Balkans and Libya, it now intends to quickly reap the benefits. This is merely part of Germany's specialized psychological warfare. Germany's diplomatic activities extend from Moscow in the east to Madrid in the west, employing largely similar tactics. However, Germany's plan seems to involve taking more concrete steps in the west, with Vichy and Madrid bearing the brunt of German propaganda. In the east, the German ambassadors stationed in Moscow and Ankara have been recalled to Berlin. Germany may not exert significant pressure in the east until these ambassadors return to their posts. However, according to Vichy officials, there is now reason to believe that Hitler believes the time to implement his plan has arrived. Reports from various sources regarding the concessions offered by Germany to France are generally consistent, such as reducing France's payments to only cover the upkeep of occupying German troops, releasing one-quarter of all French prisoners of war, and correcting the border between occupied and unoccupied France. The demands Germany is making in exchange for these concessions are not yet clear, with only rumors suggesting it seeks permission to send troops through Spain. However, what Germany is most concerned with is clearly the French fleet and French naval bases in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the activities of Ribbentrop's representative in Paris, Abetz, and the Vichy Foreign Minister Darlan, who is reportedly on his way back to Paris, must be related to the issue of the French fleet and its Mediterranean bases. Madrid is now being forced to join the Axis and allow German troops to transit in order to attack Gibraltar. Germany is clearly making a massive effort to cut off this route into the Mediterranean and establish air and submarine bases on the route of British ships traveling to Cape Town and South Africa. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: Diplomatic observers here recently commented that Germany is attempting to sever the two choke points of the Suez Canal and British Gibraltar in order to strike at British power in the Mediterranean. German-Italian forces have already invaded Egypt from Italian Libya, with their ultimate goal being to seize the Suez Canal. As for Gibraltar, they seek to threaten it from the mainland, and Spain and Portugal hold important positions in this endeavor. As for the rumor that German Ambassador to France Abetz returned to Paris from Germany carrying a plan for German troops to pass through the French free zone to enter Spain, this is entirely untrue. This rumor had been circulating even before Ambassador Abetz returned to Paris. However, as of now, Abetz has not met with Deputy Prime Minister Darlan or Brinon, the French government's representative in the occupied zone. Moreover, as the German-occupied area already borders Spain, Germany reportedly does not need to consult with the French government regarding any military actions against Spain. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>If Spain Allows German Transit, Britain Will Consider it an Act of War</p>
<p>London: There is still no confirmed news here regarding the German claim that British Imperial troops have begun to withdraw from Greece. Regarding the eventual outbreak of conflict in the western Mediterranean, well-informed sources here state that if Spain allows German troops to transit through its territory, the British government will consider it an act of war. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to news from France yesterday, large units of German paratroopers and large numbers of barges have been concentrated in Algeciras, preparing to attack Gibraltar. It is said that Germany has suggested to Spain that if Spain cooperates, it will grant Spain most-favored-nation treatment regarding transit through Gibraltar. Germany has also proposed to France that if it allows German troops to pass through unoccupied France, it will minimize the loss of French territory. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to unofficial sources, General Franco of Spain continues to refuse German troops passage through Spanish territory to attack Gibraltar. After a recent decisive cabinet meeting, Franco maintained this position, stating that Spain's current severe food situation does not allow it to abandon its neutrality. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Germany Tempts France and Spain to Join the Axis Front, Britain and the United States Monitor Developments</p>
<p>Washington: According to diplomatic sources arriving here, Germany has launched a new offensive, attempting to persuade France and Spain to join the "New Order." It is understood that the U.S. ambassadors to France and Spain are currently working to resist Germany's new offensive, emphasizing that America's boundless resources are now backing Britain, and that France and Spain should not go astray. The U.S. government is quite concerned about the outcome of this diplomatic battle, particularly regarding France. If France hands over its fleet to Germany and allows the Nazis to use its bases, Britain's war situation will become even worse. People here are quite concerned about Hitler's demand for Laval's reinstatement. Informed individuals firmly believe that if Laval obtains a key position, the French navy will soon rise up and fight against Britain. Diplomatic sources here say that pro-German elements in the Vichy government are gradually gaining prominence. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<p>Germany Plans to Utilize French North Africa</p>
<p>London: Nothing is currently known regarding any German proposals for German troops to transit through unoccupied French territory and Spain. However, it is widely believed that Germany is eager for Vichy to recall General Weygand, as Germany hopes to use French North African ports as bases for military operations and sees Weygand as an obstacle to this hope. At the same time, Germany has permitted the French to order large quantities of war materiel and other goods, and Franco-German industrial cooperation has intensified. However, regardless of Darlan's inclinations, Pétain has refused to grant Germany any land or naval concessions to avoid compromising his position toward Britain. Pétain has shown no sign of altering this stance. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The French Cabinet Is Rumored to Undergo a Reshuffle; Darlan Travels to Paris Again to Talk with German Authorities</h3>
<p>Vichy: Deputy Prime Minister Darlan intends to travel to Paris today to continue important talks with German authorities. However, those close to the Deputy Prime Minister refuse to disclose anything about the content of the talks. Diplomatic observers here say that German Ambassador to France Abetz recently returned to Germany to report on his duties and visited Hitler's headquarters on the Balkan front to seek instructions. Therefore, Deputy Prime Minister Darlan's decision to travel to Paris for talks with German authorities has special significance. Ambassador Abetz has just returned to Paris from Germany, and all matters relating to Franco-German relations should be submitted for discussion. Furthermore, after Darlan arrives in Paris, he will still exchange views with former Deputy Prime Minister Laval. According to unconfirmed reports, Darlan and D'Astier are currently considering how to cooperate, and the cabinet may undergo a partial reshuffle as a result. There are rumors that the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Finance will be replaced. However, as political figures are keeping silent on this matter, it is difficult to determine whether there is any basis for these rumors. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Spain Allocates Huge Sums to Build Vigo Port, Making it One of the Main Ports on the Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>La Coruña, Spain: The Council of State has decided to build the Port of La Coruña, making it one of the main ports on the Pacific coast of Spain. The required expenses are quite large, and it has been decided to allocate 55 million pesetas (Spanish currency) as the initial construction costs. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Troops in North Africa Are Hindered in Their Advance Due to Supply Difficulties; Fierce Fighting in Kassala</h3>
<p>Cairo: Patrols in the Cyrenaica area are still active around Fort Capuzzo and Sollum on the Egyptian border. In the past 24 hours, the enemy has not attacked Tobruk, but patrols are frequently active. The Nazis are now explaining that the main reason for the hindered advance of German troops in North Africa is natural difficulties rather than British resistance. A Berlin newspaper published an article on supply problems, stating that supplies must first be transported to Libya, and then across the desert to the front. Trucks must be equipped with special wheels, and in addition to transporting ammunition, they must also carry fresh water and fuel for field kitchens, as well as large amounts of gasoline required for the mechanized equipment of aircraft and tanks. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent with the South African British forces in Abyssinia reports from the Kassala Road that the battle for Kassala continues. Italian forces, resisting fiercely, are now putting up the strongest resistance since the Battle of Keren. The nights here are bitterly cold, and the days are scorching hot. The South African British forces are fighting hard, their clothes torn by thorns, and they have encountered rainstorms, leaving their clothes and shoes soaking wet. However, their fighting spirit is strong, and they are eager to eliminate the remnants of the Italian forces in the north. The Italian forces are entrenched on mountain ridges, firing from fortified positions, while the British forces are also returning fire. As the enemy is hiding in deep trenches and high fortifications, British operations are hampered, so progress may be slightly slower. However, British officers are confident that as they gradually close in, the Italian forces will eventually collapse. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Gibraltar's Defenses Are Strengthened; Canal Is Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>London: The defenses of Gibraltar have been greatly strengthened. A canal nine feet wide and twelve feet deep along the north side of the fortress is nearing completion. Heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns have also been increased. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Portugal Increases Defenses on the Azores Islands</h3>
<p>Lisbon: Troops from northern Portugal have arrived here and will board ships today to sail to the Portuguese Azores Islands in the mid-Atlantic to strengthen the island's defenses. Today is the third group of troops to sail to the island, so the defensive strength of the island has more than doubled its usual level. This is because American newspapers have suggested that the United States or Britain occupy Portuguese colonies, so the Portuguese government decided to take this step. Officials here hold a very reserved attitude toward American newspaper statements, but they all believe that Portugal will face Anglo-American encroachment on its territories in the Atlantic. The statements currently issued by the Portuguese government all say that Portuguese leaders and diplomatic representatives will do their best to safeguard the country's rights in order to stabilize public sentiment.

<p>European War Essays (Four) (Six)</p>
<h3>A Survey of the United States Navy</h3>
<p>Naval bases are like stepping stones in the ocean. If a navy wants to seize maritime hegemony, bases are absolutely essential. If a navy only has ships and no bases, the entire fleet's warships will be isolated and without support. There will be no place to refuel, no place to repair damage, and thus no way to make long voyages of thousands of miles in the vast ocean.</p>
<p>A perfect naval base must have the following three elements: 1. Location: It must be a militarily contested point that allows the fleet to control its trade routes. 2. Strength: It must have complete facilities so that the entire fleet can dock comfortably. It is best to have two entry and exit routes. In addition to natural barriers, it must have powerful firepower in the form of forts and anti-aircraft guns. 3. Resources: Natural resources such as water, food, and fuel must be fully available, and good transportation and skilled labor are also essential factors. In practice, a perfect naval base is very difficult to find. Perhaps the Hawaiian Islands base is closer to the ideal. Singapore is good, but it is almost isolated, and supplies are not very easy to obtain. In early September last year, President Roosevelt obtained the right for the United States to build naval bases in British territories from Newfoundland to the island of Guiana. Naval experts say that this move is tantamount to adding five more battleships to the United States. They also say that if the United States wants to defend South America as it defends North America, it should also build naval bases there.</p>
<p>In addition to its home naval bases along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, which are fully equipped to supply its fleet, the United States also has three major overseas bases: Hawaii, Panama, and the Caribbean naval base currently under construction. A fully equipped base in the Canal Zone has already been built, and the St. Thomas base can accommodate all ships except battleships. Guantanamo Bay is most suitable for naval ships to dock, so it is the main bay in the Caribbean region. In the Pacific, the United States owns the huge Pearl Harbor, and the aviation base is located between Hilo and Ewa. There is also an undefended repair dock in Manila Bay. The U.S. fleet needs a base to operate in the Far Pacific, close to Japan or the Dutch East Indies, and one option is to use the British naval port of Singapore. If Hong Kong and Port Darwin could be developed as bases, it would also be very beneficial for the U.S. Navy to repair or replenish fuel.</p>
<p>(Seven) The Ideal Modern Navy</p>
<p>Building a modern navy cannot be accomplished in the short term. Starting from thick steel plates of fifteen or sixteen inches, slowly assembling them is the only way to build the great two-ocean navy that one imagines. Based on the current military budget, the naval power each year thereafter will be as follows: By the end of 1941, there will be 14 battleships, 176 destroyers, and 115 submarines. In 1942, there will be 41 cruisers, 7 aircraft carriers, 189 destroyers, and 128 submarines. (The number of battleships will still be only 14 at this time, the same as Japan in 1942 and 1943.) In the second half of 1943, there will be 20 battleships. By 1946, the number of battleships will increase significantly to 29, with 18 aircraft carriers, 87 cruisers, and 322 destroyers. If there are no major changes in the world in these years, then the U.S. Navy will be able to dominate the seas by then. In addition to such a massive navy, there are also several hundred giant patrol bombers and Marine Corps soldiers who can assist in combat at any time and place.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mahan, the founder of the Naval War College, had a few insightful words: the land is rugged everywhere, but the sea is very flat. Any country that possesses a fleet that can control the sea and allow merchant ships to sail back and forth will surely have all the wealth of the world flowing to it. He also said that naval power seems silent and invisible, even more so than the army in wartime. As long as you hold a few key naval strongholds, such as Gibraltar, Panama, Singapore, etc., and control the world market, you will essentially rule the world.</p>
<p>The principles that Rear Admiral Mahan spoke of in 1890 have not changed to this day, but many new weapons have emerged, and tactics have also changed accordingly. For example, reconnaissance aircraft can create many unimaginable miracles, and naval aircraft carriers can bring bombers to any area that is advantageous to them, moving faster than the enemy can build airfields on land. Aircraft can also sink destroyers and even cruisers. In this European war, only battleships have not yet been threatened by aircraft.</p>
<p>A country with substantial naval power can avoid being devastated or irreparably damaged when attacked by an enemy. Therefore, local disasters, such as those encountered by Britain in 1667, 1745, 1783, 1797, and 1940, can always be resisted. However, according to Mahan's rule, any country's navy must have more warships than others in order to gain the most advantageous position. Bases must be built strongly and in strategic locations. In peacetime, there must be a sufficient reserve of manpower. In wartime, as soon as the opportunity arises, you must attack the enemy's fleet fiercely and destroy it. The reason why the U.S. Navy concentrates all its power into one fleet is precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>When the fleet is in combat, its actions must be agile and its attacks must be fierce, because all steps of shipbuilding, navigation, training, assembly, and concentration must be prepared properly before the outbreak of war. The only mission of the navy in wartime is to seize the opportunity in one fell swoop and deliver a fatal blow to the enemy. Sweep away and clear the enemy's fleet and merchant ships from the sea. Therefore, the world's two largest commercial nations, the United States of America and Great Britain, possess the strongest navies.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement to Be Officially Signed Today; U.S. to Aid China with Aircraft, Heavy Artillery, etc.; Currie to Effectively Manage the Burma Road</h3>
<p>Washington: Treasury officials said yesterday that the signing date of the Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement may be postponed to Thursday. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: The agreement for the United States to lend China US$50 million to stabilize Chinese legal tender will be signed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on behalf of the United States and T.V. Soong on behalf of China. Negotiations on this matter have been underway for some time and were only completed a few days ago. It is not yet known what action will be taken under the separate US$50 million loan for China to borrow and purchase war materials. However, it is widely believed that these funds may not be used for other purposes because China should be able to obtain all the assistance that can be shipped to China under the Lend-Lease Act. The measures that the United States will take toward China are not known in detail, but there is reason to believe that the authorities here are currently focusing on the following four things: (1) Shipping both fighter and bomber aircraft to China; (2) Supplying China with larger heavy artillery than it currently uses; (3) Supplying raw materials so that Chinese arsenals can continue to manufacture small arms, shells, hand grenades, etc.; (4) Supplying trucks to increase the transport capacity of the Yunnan-Burma Road. According to reliable sources in Washington, warnings from Tokyo newspapers against the U.S. disrupting Japan's blockade of China will not have the slightest impact on U.S. policy, as Americans want to see China receive the aid that the U.S. government has decided China should have. It is learned here that Japanese air raids have not been able to stop traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is reported that the road's transportation is now managed by a U.S. expert, and other transportation experts will soon assist in management. It is also reported that the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast is not as effective as the Japanese had hoped, as trucks can be smuggled into the interior from the coast. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Special Envoy Currie's observations and investigations in China may not be announced for some time, but news from Washington received here indicates that Currie suggested to the President that officials manage the Burma Road effectively and consolidate China's currency system. It seems that Chinese sources in Washington knew about this news first, and then it was passed on to well-informed sources here, and then to Chongqing. This seems to confirm the fact that after Currie left China, Chongqing appointed Dr. Baker, the head of the American Red Cross and a transportation expert, as the administrator of the Burma Road. As for stabilizing the currency system, Chongqing has also given it serious consideration. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has emphasized that, in fighting Japan, 30% is military and 70% is economic. In order to obtain U.S. aid, Free China has made every effort to meet U.S. expectations. However, Chinese observers are quite concerned that the European war may divert part of U.S. aid. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Reaffirms Resolve to Aid Britain</h3>
<p>New York: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the defense of the existing democratic system must be maintained in order to win, and that Britain is defending the democratic system. The current war situation cannot be determined by a single naval battle or a single retreat in Greece, nor by a single battle in the Mediterranean. He is confident that British defenses will hold, and the United States will not slacken its shipment of war materials to Britain. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt said yesterday that he believes Britain will continue to fight to resist the Nazis and protect democracy, and warned the public not to fall from the tower of hope into the abyss of despair due to daily developments. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The U.S. Ambassador spoke at the American Chamber of Commerce here, saying that the United States will aid Britain with actions, not just words, to ensure complete victory and defeat the totalitarian aggressors who endanger human freedom. There is a kind of connection between us American expatriates in Britain and the British people who are fighting for freedom, which will continue to exist forever even after the Nazis are destroyed. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>New York: Bishop Walderson, Chairman of the American Committee for Struggle for Freedom, said today that the United States has actually entered the war. For the sake of victory, we should send a motorcade to Europe as soon as possible when necessary to participate in the war. I believe that there is no way to achieve victory without taking the offensive. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: American doctors have been constantly asking the Red Cross how they can answer the call to serve. Yesterday, the Red Cross here received more than 200 applications, and there are also many doctors in Los Angeles who have volunteered. One doctor telegraphed from Chicago, "My luggage is ready, I am ready to depart, when and where can I report?". Many other telegrams also said, "Ready to volunteer, please telegraph instructions." Another doctor flew here from New York to volunteer in person. The Red Cross has now increased staff to process applications and arrange itineraries, etc. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Philippines Strengthens Defenses</h3>
<p>Washington: Well-informed congressional and diplomatic sources declared today that the strengthening of Philippine defenses appears to be the United States' response to the Soviet-Japanese public declaration. The executive branch proposed allocating US$50 million owed to the Philippine government for the Philippine defense plan under U.S. guidance. This proposal will likely be announced at the most appropriate time in U.S. diplomacy. Although this defense and other defense plans were all agreed upon with Philippine officials long before the outcome of the Soviet-Japanese public declaration was clear, diplomatic observers here believe that the government can take advantage of the Philippine defense situation as a military and diplomatic move in the current Far Eastern and Pacific relations. From a military point of view, the strengthening of the Philippines is clearly a response to Japan's threat of intensifying its actions due to developments in the Soviet Union. The increased defensive or offensive strength of the Philippines also proportionally increases the danger of Japan's plans to expand to the South Seas or the Dutch East Indies. On the diplomatic front, the strengthening of the Philippines may be a sufficient response to the appeasement of the Soviet Union, on the grounds that the military freedom gained by Japan cannot exceed or is even less than the losses caused by the expansion of Philippine defenses. The actual defensive steps that the United States will take are obviously limited to intelligence, but based on the information that has already been published and reasonable military strategy, the United States will focus on strengthening its submarines and air force, or perhaps also strengthening its coastal air defense artillery equipment. In practice, the shipment of equipment will depend on the general development of what the United States has obtained for Britain and China, but it will proceed as soon as possible within the limits of defense production after obtaining the necessary funds. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: It is learned that 2,000 American troops arrived in the Philippines yesterday, the largest number of troops ever sent by the United States to the Far East. Among them were coastal defense artillery, aviation teams, and infantry. According to news from Singapore, British troops and Indian vehicles, the Royal Air Force, and U.S.-made bombers and fighters continue to arrive, and the defense of Malaya has been greatly strengthened. The British troops arriving in Singapore include artillery, infantry, and mechanized units. (23rd)</p>
<h3>US Congressional Committee Reviews National Defense Plan, To Mobilize 2.8 Million People, Building a Strong Army in Preparation for War</h3>
<p>Washington - Acting Chief of Army Mobilization, Major General de Waal, stated here yesterday that the US Army is ready for war. During his testimony before the Committee, the Major General stated that the "Mobilization Day" planned by the Army years ago is now a thing of the past. The Army now has a headquarters ready for combat and is taking precautionary measures to mobilize 2.85 million people. The Major General solemnly declared the importance of expanding the Army, stating that the current process will allow for an army of 1.4 million people by July. However, the authorities are currently conducting research to reach the number of 2.8 million. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives met today to review the US national defense plan. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall attended and delivered a speech, stating that the United States is now building a strong army. The Army has overcome various difficulties and accelerated the development of US military affairs. He expressed great satisfaction with the current organizational system of the army, and praised the morale as being very high. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives is currently studying a draft law to change the age limit for military service from 18 to 28 years old to 21 to 35 years old. According to Democratic Senator Lenoit, the government intends to extend the term of military service, increasing the current one-year term to two years. Democratic Senator Johnson advocated for the passage of an emergency state bill, requiring those currently enlisted to remain in service until both houses of Congress repeal the law. It has also been officially announced that the Army is actively researching new types of air-raid shelters, each capable of accommodating six people and providing protection against poison gas. Once the research is completed, it will be introduced to government authorities and private manufacturers to expedite production. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>In the Sino-Foreign Cup table tennis match, Mike Pi played against Yisheng at 7:30 PM the night before at the Jewish Club on Moore Ming Road. Yisheng's strength seemed to be higher than Mike Pi's, but because the ball room was small, it was suitable for attack but not defense. Mike Pi's players were all from the Jewish B team, and they took advantage of the location to launch a preemptive attack. Yisheng lost after resisting calmly. As a result, Mike Pi won narrowly 13-10. In another match, Su Ge'er was unable to withstand Youbang's attack and was defeated miserably 1-11. There will be three more matches today.</p>

<h3>Food: Laughingly Asking Where Price Controls Have Gone; Rice Merchants Pointing Vaguely Towards the Clouds; Black Market Prices Surge Beyond Measure; Slight Reversal Yesterday; No Fear of Shortage of Supply, Only Worrying About Lack of Rectification</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend in the rice market reversed slightly. Not only did transactions decrease in all sectors, but spot prices also fell by varying amounts of 300-400 yuan and 500-600 yuan. This was mainly because the continuous rise in prices was excessive, and unscrupulous merchants were operating with a disregard for public reason and morality, and should reflect on their own danger. Therefore, many people in the industry did not sell on the market yesterday, and the market situation was greatly eased. Although there are still some market speculators who are using the excuse that the recent orders have not been completed, and that the certain foreign firm's February rice futures have not been delivered (note that Jianyuan's sale of February Xiaojiao has been delayed until now without being cleared), and that the Japanese army is advancing south, and that coastal areas have fallen, they have ultimately failed to stimulate new hoarding. Moreover, there have been some releases of previously gained profit, so the premium for Xiaojiao per 100 bags was initially 1,200 yuan, then decreased to 1,000 yuan. Spot prices are only 151-152 yuan per original bag, while futures are 154-155 yuan, and there is still a lack of buyers. Saigon No. 1 rice was initially priced at 1,300 bags, then decreased to 1,100-1,200 yuan, and other varieties followed suit. Transactions were only 6,000-7,000 bags.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Hong Kong authorities have sent people to Shanghai to negotiate with the Concession authorities and rice merchants to supply Shanghai with 200,000 to 250,000 bags per month, but with restrictions on the industry and a profit limit of within 1%. This is one of the reasons for the slight decline in rice prices yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition, people in the rice industry are also aware of their negative image, so they deliberately showed rectification yesterday, making a written statement with great fanfare, actually self-deceiving people with "complying with the rules of trading and no longer overstepping the limits of buying and selling." Brokers, who have been active for many days, also voluntarily suspended business for three days yesterday to avoid the storm. When asked that if they must comply with the rules of trading, where are the Municipal Council's new price limits, rice merchants vaguely pointed to the blank white clouds, talking about other things. From this, it is known that what they are expressing is not from the heart, and it can also be seen that price limits are like floating clouds in the sky, without any trace.</p>
<p>Domestic rice has opened slightly, but the selling price is still high at 3-4 yuan due to shipping difficulties and delayed arrivals. Wuxi Gaojing is sold at 140 yuan, Kunjing at 136 yuan, and Qingjiao Baodao at 109 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Yingzhou wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,581 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 5,051 bags were unloaded in Shanghai, and the rest will be shipped to North China tomorrow on the original ship, including 1,100 bags to Qingdao, 1,830 bags to Yantai, and 600 bags to Tianjin. There are also 940 bags of corn, which will also be shipped to Yantai on the original ship. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Tight Then Flat</h3>
<p>The flour market yesterday was tight then flat. At the opening in the morning, under the activities of local customers, hoarders continued to engage in mischief. Huawu brand Australian flour was touted to 31.34 yuan, and Jinlong Pi Kan flour to 31 yuan to 30.08 yuan. However, in the afternoon, due to the decline in rice prices, retail investors released some, so the situation turned from rising to flat. Total market transactions were 15,000-16,000 bags, and the market base was still stable. The Hua factory's flat-selling flour was still 25 yuan, supplied by the Fuxin factory with 5,873 bags, and there was no temporary change.</p>
<p>The wheat market was as quiet as usual. It is found that the supply of Dumo from the interior has been lacking for a long time, and Hua factories have no way to collect raw materials. Japanese factories in the market occasionally have scattered receipts, but the number is extremely small. The selling price is still 45-46 yuan. The market is temporarily difficult to rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Grains: Bean Cake Oversteps Boundaries; Has Not Stopped Yet</h3>
<p>Since the industry association stipulated some price limits for certain goods, other types of goods have been taken advantage of by speculators due to the lack of restraint. Yesterday's cake market was active for actual sales, and should have had a vigorous trend, but its rushing around was completely out of bounds. It is calculated that 10,000 pieces of Dayou cake were ordered at 21 yuan for delivery in early May. 26,000-27,000 pieces of Shengji cake were priced at 19 yuan to 19.3 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.5-20.05 yuan for delivery in early May, then back to 19.95 yuan, and 20.05 yuan to 20 yuan for delivery in late May, then back to 20.07 yuan. Two cars of Feizi cake were priced at 19.35 yuan for delivery in late April, 5,000 pieces of Luzi cake were priced at 19.35 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.7 yuan to 20 yuan for delivery in late May. More than 20,000 pieces of Changji cake were priced at 18.77 yuan for delivery in late April, 19.6 yuan for delivery in early May, and 19.95 yuan for delivery in late May. 12,000-13,000 pieces of Yuanji cake were priced at 18.77 yuan for the spot, 19 yuan for delivery in late April, and 20.05 yuan for delivery in early May. In addition, a car of Yuanlong overnight cake was priced at 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance, Unofficial Foreign Exchange Market, Now Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotations remained unchanged for all currencies. The unofficial British-American exchange market returned from loose to stable, mainly because gold prices fluctuated. Consequently, speculation among Chinese merchants and the willingness of Japanese banks to supply funds diminished. Both British banks and HSBC and Mercantile Bank had opportunities to buy. As a result, U.S. dollar contracts for this month, initially firm at $5.1875, became difficult to close and eventually settled at $5.15625. British gold remained stagnant at 3 pence 17/1875, similar to the closing price the previous evening. Trading volume in the morning was not high, with interbank transactions dominating. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>According to morning dispatches, both British and American bank rates were stable. The Indian market continued to contract. In foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar appreciated slightly against the British pound by a fraction of a cent, and depreciated against the Shanghai dollar by six cents, with other rates unchanged. In early domestic trading, bank selling prices were: spot British exchange at 3 pence 17/1875, and U.S. dollars at $5.15625. Speculators initially quoted May U.S. dollars at $5.1875. Russian currency firmed but was difficult to sell, and difficult to close. Zhejiang Industrial Bank sold April-May U.S. dollars at $5.1875, bought by entities from the mainland, as well as Mercantile Bank and HSBC. HSBC quotations remained unchanged for all currencies, with small counter quotations contracting by .0625. Later, news of Chase Bank offering Chinese banks this month's U.S. dollars at $5.1875 caused rates to firm slightly. Near noon, Mercantile Bank suddenly absorbed a large quantity, with some banks also bidding for this month's rate at $5.1875, which then returned to stability. At the noon close, both spot and May British exchange were at 3 pence 17/1875, and U.S. dollars at $5.15625, similar to the previous day's closing prices.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate Tightens</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw speculative trading, falling before rising again. The 6,700 yuan mark was briefly broken twice, but immediately retreated. Sentiment among participants was somewhat unstable. The foreign exchange market saw a stable and slightly firm U.S. dollar. Supply and demand dynamics between securities firms and gold firms shifted. After opening, foreign exchange brokers were eager to sell, briefly reaching 6,685 yuan, immediately supported by buying from silver firms. At noon, rumors circulated about the Shanghai Chinese banks withdrawing, boosting buying interest and pushing prices to 6,742 yuan. After learning that the four banks would jointly reopen at a new location, sentiment stabilized slightly. Small money shops aggressively sold, causing a pullback, but the closing price still rose by 24 yuan. Total trading volume for the morning was 15,600 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The off-exchange price was 6,730 yuan. For date switches (April to May contracts), sellers offered buyers a premium of 35 yuan. For spot transactions, Yongfengyu initially sold 50 taels to Shunyuan, at a price 150 yuan higher than the contract price. Wanfeng sold 10 taels to jewelers, at 140 yuan higher. Yongcheng sold 40 taels, and a gold firm sold 50 taels, all bought by jewelers, at 145 yuan higher, an increase of 30 yuan. Jewelry gold was also quoted higher by 5 yuan, reaching 710 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculative Gold Rises 24 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,710 yuan at 9:15 AM, 5 yuan higher than the previous evening's close. The price continued to rise to 6,715 yuan. Upon hearing that this month's U.S. dollar at $5.1875 could be closed, Yiyuan, Yida, Chengtai, and Xinfengyonglai sold, and the price immediately dropped by 30 yuan, entering the 6,700 yuan range, falling to 6,685 yuan. Tongkangyong and Defu, and Dan Jiulai bought, pushing the price up to the 700 yuan level. Chengji, Gongda, and Shihe also bought, reaching 6,722 yuan. Yida sold again around 6,710 yuan, hovering for a long time. At 11:10, the price slightly decreased to 6,690 yuan, then recovered. At 11:40, favorable rumors emerged, and Chengji and Gonghe bought again, with Yida also repurchasing. Many others followed, immediately pushing the price up to 6,742 yuan. Later, Shunyuan aggressively sold a large quantity, immediately pushing the price down to 6,720 yuan. The noon close was 6,729 yuan, 24 yuan higher than the previous day's close. Based on the May U.S. dollar noon closing price of $5.15625, the calculated price was 6,754 yuan, a difference of 25 yuan. After the close, the price retreated to 6,717 yuan, then 20 yuan lower. The intraday fluctuation was 57 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The off-exchange price rose to 6,730 yuan. The spot price of gold from gold firms was 160 yuan higher than the speculative contract price, with the buying price 80 yuan lower than the selling price.

<p>Jewelry Gold Quoted Higher by Five Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold was initially quoted at 705 yuan per tael, rising by 5 yuan at noon, to 710 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan, it was said.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Shows Sideways Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw speculative gold prices fluctuate slightly upwards. British and American gold pounds remained unchanged. British gold notes remained stable, and the market price stood still. U.S. dollar notes still followed a sideways trend, opening at 18.94 yuan in the morning, retreating to 89 cents and then rising to 9.04 yuan, closing at 18.95 yuan, slightly higher by four cents compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes and Japanese gold notes were balanced, and the market price stood still. The latter remained at 2.10 yuan. Korean notes were slightly firmer, closing at 1.84 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Securities, Government Bonds Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial government bond market initially continued the upward trend from the previous day's closing rebound. However, there was excessive floating supply in the market, and some people took the opportunity to sell at high prices, causing another small pullback. The multi-party support eventually failed to hold, and the market retreated again. This was due to environmental factors. Coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the reopening of the four banks, people were anxious, making it difficult to reverse the downward trend. The fundamental reason was the impending changes in the financial sector, which were not beneficial for government bonds. Initially, Tongkang bought and Xiekang covered short positions, raising prices by 34 cents. Yitai and Hengfu sold at high prices. Later, Lianyi and Yongchang bought, while Shenchang and Yizhong continued to sell. The noon close was relatively stable. In the afternoon, rumors increased, shaking market sentiment. Although Lianhe, Yichang, and Yitai bought, selling pressure remained strong, with Shengxing, Dingkang, Delong, Xinfeng, and Shuntai all entering the market, causing the market price to fall again. Class A bonds broke through 3 yuan, and Class B bonds broke through 6 yuan. Furthermore, Class D bonds had not opened for trading in recent days, with many sellers but no buyers, so trading remained impossible. The trend and environment remained bearish. The day's result was a slight decline of 1 to 4 cents. The trading volume was 1.89 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 19.50 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was mediocre from opening to noon close, with thin trading volume and a general lack of interest. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth, Transportation Blockages, Yarn Market Depressed</h3>
<p>The yarn market is generally weak, with a tendency to soften. This is due to the rapid deterioration of the European situation and the intense fighting in eastern Zhejiang, which has led to blockages in transportation lines. As a result, short sellers are active. Although margin deposits are high, market sentiment has not been stimulated. The current situation is one of sideways trading at lower levels. However, some traders are unwilling to give up their positions due to the high cost of goods. Therefore, the market has entered a state of deadlock. Currently, there appears to be a greater number of sellers in the market. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced as high as 1,502 yuan and as low as 1,482 yuan. The initial trading price in the afternoon was 1,492 yuan, rising to 1,496 yuan, and the final price was 1,495 yuan, it was said.</p>
<p>Double Horse yarn opened this morning, continuing the sharp decline from the previous afternoon, with market sentiment weak and lackluster. Furthermore, rumors were rampant. The opening price was 1,485 yuan, rising slightly to 94 yuan shortly after. However, short sellers from securities firms remained inactive, instead increasing their positions. At the same time, margin deposits opened flat, with little strength on the surface. The market gradually declined to 1,483 yuan. At this time, those with profits actively covered their positions, creating a strong upward force and pushing the price back up to 1,492 yuan. After a long period of fluctuation, around 11:30, long positions became active, and the crowd shouted to open, pushing the price up to 502 yuan. However, the price was still unstable at high levels, and it immediately fell back to 1,492 yuan at closing. According to the trading volume statistics for the morning, a total of 6,352 bales were traded. The amount of real purchases and sales from each trading group is listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 342, Mainland: 10, Fellow Traders: 6,000, Total: 6,352</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Needs Turnover Stagnant, Trading Among Counterparts Is Also Quiet</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is as sparse as ever. Due to the pervasive war clouds in the world, coupled with the sluggish yarn market, mill owners' thoughts have turned sluggish. As for counterparts, in view of the above situation, their intentions are also not as excited as in the past, so trading has been greatly reduced. Yesterday, only one transaction of spark cotton was completed, with Tongyu buying 300 bales. The price of the machinery delivery was 196 yuan, which was still a grass bag product, and the market price seemed to have fallen by two yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>According to another report, foreign cotton trading by foreign firms in Shanghai was not very active because all parties temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach, but the market situation remained firm. It did not weaken due to the unstable situation and flat buying sentiment. On the contrary, those who held spot goods were still unwilling to easily sell them. Yesterday, apart from counterparts doing one or two small batches of Indian cotton with each other, everyone else stood by and watched.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose initially due to buying by counterparts, but then fell back due to selling by southern gangs and profit-taking by long positions. As a result, closing prices were 7 to 12 points lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose initially due to strength in the stock market, but then fell due to cotton merchants selling short. However, it rose again due to buying by counterparts. Closing prices rose by 2-3 rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open lower by 2.5 rupees today "Each piece of yarn weighs 420 pounds, equivalent to about 4 yuan." Each Dou Xi spinning machine, British (Doberson) style, has 364 spindles, American style is 400 spindles, needs to be equipped with six to eight horsepower to reach one unit, the usual power rotation number, each chain from eight hundred to one thousand revolutions per minute, the power consumption of each machine is 200 characters weak, according to the current motor electricity price, each character needs 1 jiao 9 fen, almost ten times higher than before the war, then there is a spindle cost burden of 10,000 spindles, (100,000 characters), the monthly cost is 19,000 yuan, and the yarn mills with more than 100,000 spindles, the lightning cost burden is even more alarming, the monthly cost is more than 200,000 yuan in national currency, the monthly production of 6,500 bales of yarn is calculated, the electricity cost of each bag of yarn is more than 30 yuan, (the electricity consumption of each bag is 40 yuan for those with low production. It is not surprising either). If after the 24th of this month, more than 70% of the current distribution volume is exceeded. (outside the quota) If the fee is charged six times higher than the quota, wouldn't the electricity cost of each bag of yarn exceed 100 yuan? This is really a serious problem for major yarn mills. If, due to the saving of electricity, the workload is reduced by 50% (estimated by the author), then the workers' work is reduced by half, which means that the wages are reduced by half. Such an impact on the lives of male and female workers is also extremely serious, resulting in labor-related disputes and affecting the entire social security, which is even more shuddering. Therefore, I say: The current isolated island's industrial and commercial society is really in a situation of torture and suffering! Surrounded by enemies on all sides, it is not only the yarn mill that is in trouble. However, the power saving, from a small point of view, the losses of Chinese factories are not small, but from the standpoint of national industry, the advantages still outweigh the disadvantages.

<h3>Piece Goods, Cloth Prices Depressed</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market fell yesterday because Zhejiang and Fujian gangs pre-ordered various cloths and urgently sought to sell them in Shanghai, and counterparts and hoarders absorbed them at reduced prices, resulting in a slump in the sales of white goods. Fine cloth twill continued to fall by 3-7.5 cents per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2.5-5 cents, and bleached and dyed cloth and coarse twill prices were more stable. Over 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, over 200 pieces of colored cloths, colored twills, and woolen fabrics were handled by Cantonese and Hong Kong firms, and over 100 pieces of blue cloth, yellow-green khaki, and bleached cloth were handled by Nanyang firms.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth was weak in the morning and rebounded at noon, with market sentiment slightly firm. Longtou fine cloth closed at 51.25 yuan in the morning, and rebounded by 3 cents in the after-market to 51.55 yuan. Four Gentlemen drill cloth closed at 1.5475 yuan per yard in the evening, also up 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Paris Cloth Has Relief</h3>
<p>Plain Paris cloth: The market trend was soft yesterday. Yihuo Wufutu brand, dropped and sold at 21 yuan after commission. There was no original box to buy. Because there was a definite message about Lixing and Hongsheng goods. Three hundred boxes can be transported within ten days. In addition, businessmen run by Russian and Jewish merchants, said that the Paris cloth spot, there will soon be 1,000 pieces of relief to Shanghai, causing the market to shake. Those who have a considerable hoarding of goods, want to be the first to come out, but the fact is played out, even if they shout cheap five or six cents a yard, it is still difficult to open for a while.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Arrange Outlets, Dyeing and Weaving Factories Are Major Customers</h3>
<p>The current standard for speculative cotton cloth is Longtou fine cloth, 12 pounds, produced by Japanese Yufeng Yarn Factory. Spot and warehouse receipt trading is done at the "Cloth Industry Market" (3rd floor, 25 Hankou Road), formerly known as "White Goods Market", specializing in trading Japanese factory woven fine cloth and fine twill, etc., under the jurisdiction of the Cotton Cloth Association. This year, due to the issuance of fake warehouse receipts, it has separated from the Cotton Cloth Association, and a transformed "Cloth Industry Market" has been formed by a certain gang. Futures are traded at the Cotton Industry Exchange Co., Ltd., which is composed of Japanese merchants. Its main purpose is to dye various colored cloths (i.e., Indanthrene, etc.), and the brand of the dyeing factory can be sold to the mainland and various parts of Nanyang under the name of "National Products" without hindrance. However, because it has become the standard for public speculation, the price is higher than other brands, becoming a speculative chip. Dyeing and weaving factories instead use Japanese factory Caiball, Yanghe, and Lanjit brands to make cloth, and the cost per piece is about 30 yuan. The price is pulled up to more than 50 yuan by speculative merchants' excessive and reckless bidding. However, the chips in the market are full, the inventory is abundant, and there are no real sales. Because transportation to the occupied areas is controlled by the Japanese military, and transportation to free China is strictly prohibited by the National Government, and the Japanese price is far more than the cost, the factory continues to open. If the long positions come out, there will be a sharp drop, as in the tragic drop in May last year, I don't know how many cotton cloth shops closed down. This is why, (Ji Hong)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse White Futures Sugar, Maximum Limit Is 108 Yuan</h3>
<p>The previous day's sugar price had excessive fluctuations, and there was fear of other changes, so the sugar industry executive and supervisor conference decided to temporarily restrict new trading of coarse white futures sugar and stipulated that the maximum price should not exceed 108 yuan. As a result, the upward trend turned flat, but the strong and expensive attitude was still not lost. The association divided the market, and the spot 24 coarse white was initially 102 yuan to 1.5 yuan, 1 yuan, and then rebounded to 103 yuan, 4 yuan, 3.1 yuan, and 7 cents. Futures also started flat and then became expensive. The end of April list was 102 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 2.2 yuan, 2 yuan, 3.5 yuan, 5.5 yuan, 5 yuan, 4 yuan, and 4.5 yuan, 4 yuan, down by 34 yuan. The May 10th list was 103 yuan, 2.5 yuan, 2.7 yuan, 2.8 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan, 4.5 yuan, 6 yuan, 6.8 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 5.5 yuan, slightly lower by 3.5 yuan compared to the highest price. Dutch raw sugar 80 yuan, nearly 10 yuan higher than (the 17th), Taikoo car white B brand West Warehouse 111 yuan, East Warehouse 110 yuan, (the 21st) about 5 yuan higher, DY brand East and West warehouses pulled 102 yuan, 7 yuan higher, HX brand West warehouse 102 yuan, the increase is the same. This factory's snow white also took the opportunity to move, rising to a new high price of 102 yuan. This fourth-grade white was 98 yuan, and Jingming ice also saw a new high price of 138 yuan. This ice flower Qing was priced at 85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Hemp, Hemp Bags Are Firm</h3>
<p>The market price of hemp bags has been fluctuating recently, and now it is gradually becoming firm. The market stock is still thin, and the turnaround in recent days has shifted, such as 2.5-pound new green has reached 5.5 yuan, 2.25 pounds is 5.2 yuan, fork rushed new bag 5 yuan, this street rushed new bag 4.8 yuan, rice white thread 4.6 yuan, rice wheat rushed new 4.2 yuan, dry sugar bag 3 yuan, soy blue thread bag 2.3 yuan, Indian hemp bag thread 2,900 yuan per thousand pounds, fork hemp bag cloth 2,000 yuan, domestic original machine cloth 2,200 yuan per thousand pieces, and flat silk cloth 2,150 yuan. However, Hang green hemp has recently arrived, and the price is more appropriate, each piece is 140 yuan, (Yan)</p>
<h3>Coal, Coal Balls Have No Hope of Rising Again</h3>
<p>The market conditions for coal balls have been stable in recent days due to warm weather and sluggish sales. The supply of coal powder is also constant, and the ships for next month have also been booked, so there is no shortage. In addition, a coal ball factory in Nanshi has recently established an industry self-vehicle, at 275 yuan per ton, so various factories in the concession have also started competing, and the dark price has recovered slightly. The goods from large factories are 292 yuan, and the small factories are 78 yuan cheaper. There is no reason to rise again in the near future. The news that a certain newspaper recently spread about the brisk news of coal ball wholesale demolition is also a castle in the air and is not true.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous, Soap Is More Expensive</h3>
<p>Daily necessities, such as soap, have a strong upward trend. Various parties have smooth demand, and sales are few. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and the market is becoming more and more tight, causing prices to soar. Yesterday, the market opened, such as Gu Ben soap was sold to 51.5 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap was 47.5 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao soap was 41 yuan per box, and scissors soap was 40.05 yuan per box. The buying prices were more than last week.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Large Tinplate, One Up and One Flat</h3>
<p>The American large tinplate of No. 26 and No. 24, because the factory's procurement is weak and there is not much progress in other sales channels, the market appears very quiet. However, because overseas goods have disappeared, those who hold the goods still have high expectations. Among them, because the market price of No. 24 colors rose too much in the past, the actual sales are even more rare, and the standard is also stagnant. The goods of No. 26 are priced cheaply, so there are many inquiries, and the market is rising step by step. Yesterday, for example, No. 24 was sold for 1,200 yuan per box, (no up or down compared to the previous), and No. 26 was shouted for 150 yuan per box, about 50 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Towels (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Guo Xiushi</p>
<p>There are many types of printed towels. One type is printed in the center of the towel - that is, the part with the raised loops - and another type is printed on the plain cloth at both ends of the towel. There are also towels woven with colored yarn in grids, stripes, etc., with printing added. There are also towels with small flowers printed around the perimeter. Most printed towels are printed on one side, while fine products are printed on both sides, which is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>Three steps are required to prepare printed towels: First, the pattern must be novel; second, the position must be chosen appropriately; third, the colors must be harmoniously matched! Otherwise, it will lose the "beauty" condition. Although the flower-woven towels are woven with colored yarn in grids, stripes, and other patterns, they look very simple, but the colored yarn must be properly matched in order to be called "beautiful" and to be pleasing and pleasing. If the colored yarn is not properly matched, it is "tacky".</p>
<p>There are few jacquard face towels. However, there are many jacquard towel fabrics, bath towels, bed towels, etc., so there are more patterns.</p>
<p>Towel fabrics are mostly used for making bath towels and pajamas. Unfortunately, although this fabric has many patterns and beautiful colors, many of the dyes used are not washable and will fade in the water. Isn't this a fly in the ointment! It also loses credibility. I hope that weaving factories will reform this - end -</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Are Affected By Electricity, Large-Scale Reduction In Work Is A Must</h3>
<p>Since the power company's emergency measures, decided to implement new emergency restrictions from the 24th of this month (from the decision date of the meter reading after the 24th.). All users with electricity consumption exceeding 1,000 degrees will be charged six times the price. The first to bear the brunt of this will undoubtedly be the textile factories in light industry. It should be known that each 10,000 spindles consumes more than 100,000 degrees of electricity per month. Yarn factories with more than 50,000 spindles need 1,000 kilowatts of electricity per hour. Working 24 hours a day and night, the electricity consumption is 24,000 characters. Calculated for 28 days of work a month, (excluding 48 hours on Sunday nights), a total of more than 670,000 characters of electricity are required. Before the war, (before August 13th), the motor electricity price per character was 2 cents in national currency, and yarn factories with more than 5 acres of spindles had to pay a monthly electricity bill of 134,000 yuan, averaging 3 yuan 67 jiao per bag of yarn produced per month, (calculated at 1 pound per 10,000 spindles). If we add a detailed analysis, we said earlier that the work of one day and night consumes 24,000 characters of electricity, estimated at 50,000 spindles, each 10,000 spindles needs 4,800 characters of electricity, the electricity fee is 2 cents per character, (before the war), a total of 96 yuan of electricity fee in national currency is required, (that is, each spindle needs 9.6 cents of electricity, that is, the electricity cost per pound of yarn is borne).</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Negotiate, Monthly Supply of Food for Shanghai Residents Determined, Minimum of 200,000 Bags of "Small Grain Rice" Guaranteed, Profit Limits Enforced with Unified Procurement and Sales, Commissioners Hallett and Others to Return to Hong Kong Soon to Report on Negotiations</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two foreign concessions have shown deep concern for the overall food supply of Shanghai. Earlier this month, they organized a committee and chartered ships to ensure that 15,000 to 20,000 tons of Rangoon rice could be transported to Shanghai monthly, increasing the food reserves and benefiting the people. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the rice-producing areas under British and French jurisdiction, requesting facilitation for the shipment of rice to Shanghai. The Hong Kong government, recognizing the close relationship between Hong Kong and Shanghai, specially appointed commissioners, including Henry Hallett, to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the authorities of the two concessions. This would ensure a monthly supply of 200,000 to 250,000 bags of special "small grain" rice from Rangoon. Mr. Hallett and his team met with Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Jiang Hongbin and others previously to discuss the rice supply. To expedite the process, they are scheduled to return to Hong Kong to report on the negotiations. It was decided that unified procurement and sales would be adopted for Hong Kong rice to prevent speculators from manipulating the market. The Standing Committee has already sent a letter to the Grain, Bean, and Rice Associations, urging them to quickly organize a group for centralized procurement to increase reserves and benefit the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Decision to Organize a Procurement Group</p>
<p>After receiving the letter from the Shanghai Bean, Rice, and Grain Associations, they immediately convened a joint meeting of the third session of the executive and supervisory committees at 3 PM yesterday. The proposal was unanimously approved on the spot and will be announced to the grain and rice markets today. Because the Hong Kong government has appointed a representative to Shanghai to discuss the unified procurement and sales of Hong Kong rice with Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and has instructed the two Shanghai associations to organize a procurement group, a joint meeting of the third session of the executive and supervisory committees and the "Jian Mi" (pointed rice) group was convened. It was decided that the principle of organizing a group to purchase Hong Kong rice was approved. After collecting opinions and confirming the quantities, a special committee will be established to formulate specific measures and implement the matter. It is hereby announced that all businesses should consider the aforementioned decision. Those who agree to participate should submit a written report of the quantity they wish to purchase to the two Shanghai associations by the 25th of this month. As for the specific methods, they will be discussed after the quantities have been collected. This announcement is specifically made. At yesterday's joint meeting, Chairman Jiang Hongbin also reported that he was summoned by Deputy Director General Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council a few days ago and rushed to the meeting. Mr. Ho introduced the four members sent by the Hong Kong government. After discussions, it was agreed that the Hong Kong government would supply a large amount of foreign rice each month. The foreign rice would contain 42% broken rice.</p>
<p>Middle Class Can Benefit</p>
<p>Reporters from the "New Voice" newspaper learned from rice industry sources yesterday that Hong Kong's rice reserves have now exceeded the specified limit. In the future, the excess rice can be shipped to Shanghai, with a maximum of 250,000 bags and a minimum of 200,000 bags per month. It is understood that after the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, it must be sold to legitimate rice shops approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council for circulation in the market and must not be hidden. The profit margin for rice merchants when selling is limited to 10%. Anyone who violates this rule will not be entitled to these rights in the future. The rice supplied by the Hong Kong government is limited to special small grain rice from Rangoon. The selling price has not yet been formally agreed upon and will be equivalent to the prices of various grades of rice in Shanghai. Therefore, after the rice arrives, middle-class residents may be able to purchase cheaper rice.</p>
<p>Rice Market Announcement: Do Not Exceed Limits Again</p>
<p>The Rice Market Management Committee, due to the continuous surge in rice prices in recent days, which not only hinders the people's livelihood but also affects the safety of its own business, specially issued Notification No. 189 yesterday morning, which stated: "Announcement: The organization of this market was originally intended to regulate the people's food supply and balance market prices. Since its establishment, it has been over three years. However, it has gone through turbulent waves and changing situations, and now it has deviated from its original intention. Even with foreign rice, although transportation is difficult and freight costs have increased dramatically, futures contracts have been signed, and rice is continuously transported to Shanghai, accumulating to over a million bags. The Special District authorities, to consider the difficulties of merchants, have cancelled the price evaluation, benefiting rice merchants in every possible way. However, in less than ten days, prices have soared again. Therefore, the Special District authorities, for the sake of public order and the livelihood of the people, have to reimpose strict restrictions. This market, under orders, has already made announcements known to all. However, before the ink is dry, market prices have become chaotic again. This phenomenon is truly unacceptable. Therefore, we are issuing another announcement: All our merchants must comply with regulations and consider the overall situation, and must not exceed limits when buying and selling. Those who dare to deliberately violate this will be held accountable. Do not deceive yourselves and ruin the market's reputation. This announcement is specially made known to all. We hope that everyone will comply."</p>
<p>Rice Shops Demand Elimination of "Extra Fees"</p>
<p>Since the bulk of rice was manipulated in Shanghai and cut off, panic about the food supply has increased day by day. Although the authorities have evaluated and set standard selling prices, those groups are incorrigible, recklessly ravaging the market and continuing to raise prices for profit, resulting in rampant black market deals and soaring "extra fees." All rice shops in the city procure the spot goods they sell each day from the market, making a profit of 1.5 yuan per "shi" (unit of dry volume). However, since the black market appeared, no one seems to be selling according to the set limits. To cope with market consumption, rice shops are selling at a loss. Yesterday at 1 PM, more than 300 rice shop representatives gathered in front of the Rice Industry Association at the Mouyi Rice Shop on Shanhai Guan Road, requesting that the association find a way to ask the authorities to ban the black market. After the association leaders persuaded them, they returned around 4 PM. However, before leaving, they stated that they would stop entering the market to buy and sell starting today.</p>
<p>Brokers Temporarily Suspend Market Entry Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to the rampant black market and soaring "extra fees" in the rice market, with the highest premium reaching 1,800 yuan, the Rice Broker Association, to avoid criticism from the outside world, separately notified its members in writing the day before yesterday, instructing them to temporarily suspend brokerage activities starting yesterday. All members, after learning of this, stopped entering the market yesterday. It is understood that after the rice market returns to normal, they will resume brokerage activities. Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight decrease in prices by 3-4 yuan per "shi" compared to the previous day, as the authorities were determined to take thorough measures, the Rice Market Management Committee reiterated the ban, and 30,000 bags of rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Speculators, fearing being hit, began to rein themselves in slightly. It is expected that under the Standing Committee's determination to stabilize the food supply for the people of Shanghai, prices can continue to fall.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Maintain Shanghai's Financial Market, Resume Interbank Clearing, Transfer of Funds Restored Yesterday, But Cash Withdrawals from the Four Banks Not Allowed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, after temporarily suspending operations since April 17th, have received orders from their headquarters to resume operations as soon as possible to maintain financial stability. The branches are now preparing to resume operations, and the concession authorities have pledged to provide full protection. It is reported that during the suspension, the banks negotiated to find ways to adjust interbank finances to maintain the overall financial situation. Transfer of funds has been restored since yesterday. Fund transfer orders from banks and financial institutions to the four banks can be cleared through the Banking Clearing House. However, these fund transfer orders cannot be directly taken to the four banks to withdraw cash. With this adjustment, the financial market has become more stable. Rumors of withdrawal have been proven untrue, and speculation has subsided, calming people's minds. It is reported that the four banks have resumed interbank clearing directly to adjust interbank finances and indirectly to maintain Shanghai's industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Rumor: Four Banks to Establish Joint Office</p>
<p>The "Times" newspaper reported that last night (April 23rd), authoritative sources said that the four banks under the Chinese government, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, plan to close their branches here to protect their employees from attacks and establish a joint office to continue operations. It is said that the equipment in the joint office can defend against terrorist activities, but its address has not been disclosed, but it will supposedly open soon. The joint office of the four banks will have only 100 staff members to provide service and prepare to gradually reduce the scope of business and encourage customers to do business with commercial banks or money houses here. According to reliable sources, before the joint office is established, the banks will first resume business. When reporters investigated Chinese semi-official banking circles and asked where the joint office will be located, it was said that the joint office will be in a new building west of Tongfu Road on Jing'an Temple Road. As for the opening date, it is said to be within this month, as the building is currently being equipped with various protective facilities.</p>
<h3>Hegot Arrives in Haiphong, Will Be Escorted to Saigon, Subject to Preliminary Review by Naval Authorities</h3>
<p>Hegot, former president of the French War Veterans Association in Shanghai and leader of the Free French movement, was arrested on April 5th at his residence on Lafayette Road on charges of inciting French sailors to desert. He was escorted to Saigon and arrived in Haiphong the day before yesterday (April 22nd). He will travel to Saigon by train for preliminary review by the French naval authorities. If the evidence is solid, he will be tried by a military court. It is reported that, at the urging of Hegot's friends, French lawyer Prime of Shanghai has invited Saigon's famous lawyer Malpeyre to defend Hegot.</p>
<h3>Coolidge Arrives Today, Sails to America Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The American postal ship, President Coolidge, arrived in Shanghai on April 9th from America, heading to Hong Kong and Luzon. Now it is returning from Luzon, passing through Hong Kong and returning to America. It is scheduled to arrive at 2:30 PM today. Passengers will transfer to small boats prepared by the company and land at the Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The postal ship will stay in Shanghai overnight and depart at 8:30 PM tomorrow night, heading to Japan, passing through Honolulu, and returning to Los Angeles. The last small boat to pick up passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 7:15 PM tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Officials of the First Special District Court Move Into the Court</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that, after the residence of Xiang Zhejiong, chief prosecutor of the First Special District Court, was disturbed ten days ago, judges and senior officials of the First Special District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court have almost all moved into the court to prevent accidents. However, from around midnight to 4:30 AM this morning (April 23rd), the residences of the judges of the First Special District Court, Mo Runhua, Li Hu, and Gui Yu, were bombed or shot at in succession. Mo's residence is in Xieqiao Lane on Tongfu Road, Li's residence is in Fude Lane on Hart Road, and Gui's residence is at 733 Lane on Connaught Road. It is assumed that those who went there arrived in black cars. Unable to enter the residences of the three judges, they fired 30 to 100 shots and then fled. The patrolmen protecting the three residences also fired dozens of shots in return. Those who went to Li's residence threw a hand grenade when they fled, damaging an electric car parked at the entrance of Li's lane.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attempt to Advance in Ningbo, Stopped by Chinese Troops, Chinese Troops Arrive and Counterattack the Urban Area, Japanese Planes Bomb Outside Ningbo's West Gate</h3>
<p>The war situation in eastern Zhejiang has stabilized after the strong resistance of the Chinese army. Fierce battles continue in the suburbs of the occupied areas. The Datong News Agency reporter now records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Arrive</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter, who learned from Zhejiang groups in Shanghai: (1) Japanese troops in Ningbo reinforced their attacks on Shiqi, Cixi, and Yuyao starting on April 21st but were met with strong resistance from Chinese troops and failed to succeed. (2) Chinese troops continued to arrive and began to counterattack the urban area. (3) Japanese troops occupying Haimen attacked Huangyan, and fierce battles continued. The situation in Wenzhou was extremely chaotic. (4) The area from Xicheng to Wangchun Bridge outside Ningbo's West Gate was bombed by Japanese planes. (5) Japanese troops landing in Shipu were met with strong resistance and dared not continue to advance.</p>
<p>Countryside Peaceful</p>
<p>Mail and telecommunications between Shanghai and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been completely cut off due to the war. Shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has also been interrupted. However, mail and telecommunications with the inland areas of eastern Zhejiang are still maintained. Zhejiang natives in Shanghai, deeply concerned about their hometowns, have been sending telegrams to inquire about details. Yesterday, a private telegram stated that residents of Ningbo, Zhenhai, Shaoxing, and Shipu mostly evacuated to the remote mountains in the countryside when the Japanese troops landed. Currently, the situation in the remote areas is still peaceful, so there are few casualties among the residents, which is comforting.</p>

<h3>Traffic in Nanshi Still Obstructed, Thorough Searches Throughout the Area, Only Xin Kaihe and Nanyang Bridge Allowed for Entry and Exit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, traffic in Nanshi was still not fully unobstructed. Japanese military police were still heavily guarding the main intersections of Minguo Road. Citizens entering and exiting Nanshi and the concessions were only allowed to enter and exit through Xin Kaihe and Nanyang Bridge. All others were prohibited. At the same time, the Japanese conducted a large-scale search of the entire Nanshi area from yesterday morning to noon.</p>
<p>Nine Inmates Escape, No Trace</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported, according to reliable sources, that nine inmates escaped from Nanshi Prison yesterday morning (April 22nd). Japanese military police and police immediately conducted a large-scale search throughout Nanshi. The French Concession Police Department also closed all but one of the iron gates connecting to Nanshi to assist. The search continued today (April 23rd), but the results have not been disclosed by the Japanese authorities in Nanshi. However, well-informed sources believe that the nine escapees are still nowhere to be found. It is said that anyone entering Nanshi today is subject to strict inspection at the iron gates. There are rumors that a Korean was shot in Nanshi, leading to a more thorough search, but this has not been confirmed by responsible parties. It is said that the nine escapees were arrested in Nanshi and the western district two weeks ago.</p>
<h3>Cornaby to Return to England via America Tomorrow Morning, Colleagues Will See Him Off at the Wharf</h3>
<p>Cornaby, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after announcing his retirement at the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17th, immediately decided to leave Shanghai for England for a short period to meet his wife. Western newspapers reported that Cornaby would leave this Monday, but "New Voice" reporters learned from Cornaby that he would leave Shanghai tomorrow. It is now reported by sources close to Cornaby that the former Chairman has decided to take a sea voyage to relax, taking the route via San Francisco in America and returning to England across the Atlantic Ocean. Cornaby is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning on the American De Tong Lun Company's President Coolidge. Cornaby will board the Jianghai Customs passenger ship, the Mary Mahler, at 7:00 AM tomorrow. At that time, friends in Shanghai, foreign directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and his subordinates will go to the wharf to see him off. Cornaby is currently the General Manager of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., having been in China for fourteen years.</p>
<p>Following His Grandfather</p>
<p>As General Manager of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Cornaby was promoted to Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Committee Member of the British Chamber of Commerce in 1936. He was re-elected in 1938 and served as Deputy Chairman for two terms. Last year, Chairman Fessenden retired, and Cornaby took over. At the foreign taxpayers' meeting held at the Race Club on January 23rd this year, Cornaby eloquently explained why the administrative structure of the Concession could not be changed and the 40% tax increase was justified. He was then wounded in the arm by Lin Xiongji’s gunshot. Later, at a special foreign meeting reopened on January 5th, the tax increase plan was passed. Cornaby went to Hong Kong for treatment before returning to Shanghai to preside over the election of the council directors. According to Cornaby's associates, Cornaby is not expected to return to Shanghai in the short term. People in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, have expressed their regret at Cornaby's departure.</p>

<h3>Price Increase for Water and Electricity in the French Concession, Tram and Bus Fares Also Increase, Effective April 27th</h3>
<p>An employee of the French Concession's "Yong Dian" (Eternal Electricity) Company announced today (April 23rd) that the French Concession's water and electricity prices have been approved by the French Municipal Council and will be implemented from April 27th. At the same time, tram and bus fares in the French Concession will also increase from that date.

<h3>Commercial Press Did Not Resume Operations Yesterday, All Parties Mediate Together, Distribution Offices and Factories Closed, Mediators Plan to Telegraph Hong Kong for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Commercial Press, after all employees of the press began a slowdown strike on the afternoon of the 22nd, saw the doors of the press tightly closed yesterday. Many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed around the press. Only a Mr. Jie Qiansheng remained inside, and no one else was seen. Yesterday, a person in charge of the Commercial Press Workers' Association told a "Da Guang" (Great Light) News Agency reporter that this action by the association was a last resort. We cannot bear to see China's largest cultural institution collapse, but the company's management is too unsympathetic to the livelihood of the employees and has rejected our reasonable demands. All employees are willing to make reasonable struggles under the legal leadership of the workers' association. We are currently awaiting a response from the Hong Kong authorities. If they continue to adhere to their views, the future will be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Labor Party Deliberations</p>
<p>The labor party of the press convened a general meeting of all employees in the warehouse on Guangdong Road yesterday morning and resolved: (1) to collect a special donation of two yuan per person to prepare for any subsequent expenses, and (2) to compile a directory of all employees (which was completed yesterday) for communication purposes. The reporter also learned from another source that the management of the press was still very firm yesterday. It is reported that the book industry, to avoid the expansion of the situation, will come forward to mediate and plans to work with Miss Hinden, director of the Industrial Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to telegraph Hong Kong to Qian Yunwu, the general manager, to negotiate mediation terms to quickly resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Workers' Attitude</p>
<p>According to representatives of the factory workers of the association, the management closed the distribution offices and all factories the night before, and all employees could not enter the factories to work, gathered in the open air, and no one was responsible, causing outrage. Each factory on Gordon Road, Jiujiang Road, and Jing'an Temple Road has a mutual aid society established, but in this critical moment, the societies are still not actively leading the employees to negotiate with the management. All employees, because of their vital interests, feel that there is no one to lead them and immediately held an automatic meeting, immediately forming a workers' representative group and cooperating with the workers of the distribution offices with the same demands and unified steps, and organizing a joint office. The temporary office is established in the Jing'an Temple Road factory. All employees are calm and in good condition. It is reported that the general manager of the World Book Company, Lu Gaoyi, has been mediating with the Industrial Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the labor and management parties for preliminary mediation.</p>

Anyone who is determined to reform can send a letter to this newspaper and forward it to the hospital for registration as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Prevention Movement and the Elimination of Spitting</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Second Tuberculosis Prevention Movement Publicity Conference began on the 16th of this month, it has been going on for a week. According to the news from the office of the conference yesterday, the public has been actively requesting X-ray examinations or sputum tests from hospitals and clinics during the past week of the tuberculosis prevention movement. Pharmacies provide medicines at low prices to benefit the poor and sick. Cinemas screen publicity films, warning citizens to prevent tuberculosis and work together to promote the movement, which has achieved significant results. Free X-ray examinations, sputum tests, and pharmacies providing medicines at low prices will continue until the end of this month. At that time, the conference will compile statistics and publish them to the public. The annual health campaign week of the Shanghai Women's Federation, namely the elimination of spitting movement, will also begin today with the cooperation of the two concession authorities, so that citizens can completely eliminate the bad habit of spitting to avoid spreading diseases.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Cargo Ship in Shanghai Suddenly Occupied by Italian Troops, Italian Side Says the Move Was to "Protect" It</h3>
<p>The Yugoslav cargo ship, the Tonislav, weighing 5,300 tons, docked in the Huangpu River at buoy No. 134. At 3:00 PM on Tuesday (April 22nd), Italian navy troops stationed in Shanghai suddenly sent marines to the ship. The Italian consulate in Shanghai has admitted this move but said that the Italian troops were going to "protect" the cargo ship. According to Major Scafe, ship registrar of the Italian court here, the ship owner declared to the Italian consulate that he had received a telegram from the ship company asking him to request the Italian consulate to send personnel to "protect" the ship. Therefore, the Italian authorities granted his request and sent troops to the ship. In the future, the ship will continue to fly the flag of Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>A Child Reading at a Bookstall Suddenly Reports His Disappearance</h3>
<h3>Three or Four Children Vanish Without a Trace; Small Bookstall Owner Also Reported Missing</h3>
<p>Shen Yuan Coal Store, located at No. 251 Juli Road in the concession, is opened by Yang Zhaohong from Ningbo. Yang Zhaohong has an elder brother named Zhaobi, who sets up a small bookstall in front of the store to make a living. Last night at 9 p.m., three or four children were at the bookstall browsing small books. The children's families, because the children had been out for a long time, went to the bookstall to check, but could not find any trace of the children. They searched extensively nearby, but found nothing. The children's families suspected that Yang Zhaobi had abducted and hidden them, and immediately reported it to the police. Detectives were dispatched to search inside the Shen Yuan Coal Store to see if any missing children were there. It is heard that Yang Zhaobi is also out and his whereabouts are unknown. The police are still investigating the details.</p>
<p>Judge's Residence on Connaught Road Shot at Last Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:40 a.m., a car suddenly appeared at Lane 732, Connaught Road, carrying several men, intending to drive into the lane. The lane watchman, considering it was late at night and their behavior was suspicious, refused to open the lane gate. The people in the car, seeing no progress, opened fire into the lane, firing more than twenty shots before speeding away in the original car. Afterwards, it was learned that Gui Yu, a judge of the Civil Division of the Special First Court, lived at No. 28 in the lane. It is speculated that someone intended harm to him.</p>
<p>Landlord of Lian Zhu Lane Raises Rent</p>
<p>Tenants Firmly Oppose</p>
<p>Landlord Disregards Good Faith and Changes His Mind Repeatedly</p>
<p>Tenants Unite and Fight, Refusing to Yield</p>
<p>A Cantonese merchant named Chen, the landlord of Lian Zhu Lane on Avenue Edward VII, and the renting agent, Maiton &amp; Co., had negotiated with the tenants about raising the rent, and an agreement was reached, stipulating that the rent would not be increased again within two years. Only the water bill would be borne by the tenants if it increased in the future. Seeing the tenants were accommodating, but also feeling it was inconvenient, they openly broke the agreement and colluded with a foreigner from a certain country to come forward, using the excuse of buying all the buildings on the land in the lane, and uniquely notified Nos. 9, 11, and 12 in the lane to move out within a limited time. The method was already bizarre. On the 5th of this month, they deliberately published an advertisement for sale, but only specified one or two houses, not the entire lane, and the timing was after the purchase requested by the foreign merchant, clearly intending to intimidate. After receiving the news, the tenants were greatly angered, believing that it concerned the public interest and was not just the affair of one or two families. Why single out one or two families for oppression? Therefore, they unanimously entrusted Chinese and foreign lawyers to negotiate separately. The landlord gradually realized they were in the wrong and also entrusted a lawyer to mediate, willing to fulfill the previous agreement and not increase the rent within two years. The water bill, if it increased in the future, would still have to be borne by the tenants. The tenants, having already increased the rent, felt that the water bill was naturally included and should not be borne separately. After negotiations with the opposing lawyer, the tenants, in order to settle the matter, agreed to accept the water bill proposed by the landlord, calculated as an annual average, with the tenants bearing any amount exceeding one thousand yuan per month. Just as both parties were about to sign a settlement agreement, the landlord and Maiton &amp; Co. broke the agreement again, changing the agreement of not increasing the rent for two years to one year. Seeing the landlord repeatedly going back on their word and not honoring their commitments, the tenants again asked a lawyer to deal with them legally. If the landlord and Maiton &amp; Co. continued to use oppressive measures, they were determined to unite and fight to the end, striving to uphold justice and ensure secure housing.</p>
<p>Copper and Iron Factory Fire</p>
<p>Six People Burned</p>
<p>At No. 23, Lane 638, New Zha Road (i.e., Sze Sween Li), the Ren De Copper and Iron Machinery Factory caught fire yesterday at 6:30 p.m. due to the overturning of a barrel of alcohol. Dense smoke filled the air, and the fire was extremely fierce, spreading to the neighboring Ta Teh Pharmaceutical Factory in an instant. The fire was finally extinguished after the Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and made every effort to put it out. As a result, two buildings were completely burned down. During the blaze, six people from the Ta Teh Pharmaceutical Factory escaped from the fire, suffering severe burns. Their names are as follows: Chen Longyao, 18 years old; Xie Huiwang, 24 years old; Lu Qingyun, 18 years old; both suffered injuries all over their bodies and are in critical condition. Huang Genbao, 20 years old; Wu Guangshun, 37 years old; Ding Zhengren, 28 years old; suffered injuries to their faces and limbs. The six were all sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment.</p>
<p>Robbers Steal Car</p>
<p>The Car's Whereabouts Are Unknown</p>
<p>Last night at 9:40 p.m., the Yong An Automobile Company at No. 9 Yangshupu Road suddenly received a phone call requesting a car to be dispatched to wait at the intersection of Zhejiang Road on Rue du Consulat. The company immediately dispatched a car (registration number 17631) to the location. A man got into the car and asked to be driven to Connaught Road. The man then forced the driver out of the car and drove off himself at high speed. The reason for the car theft could not be investigated immediately, and the car's whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Estate Dispute of a Deceased Comprador of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Pan Ruixin, a deceased comprador of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and a native of Sanbei, amassed a fortune of one million yuan during his lifetime. After his death last year, his eldest son, Pan Shiqi, took charge of dividing the entire estate among his siblings. However, Pan Shishou, the son of Pan Ruixin's concubine, Ms. Han, was not given a share, only Pan Shishou's wife, Ms. Qin, was given 13,000 yuan, reportedly in accordance with his father's will. Recently, Pan Shishou discovered that the will had been forged by Pan Shiqi in collusion with lawyers A and B, intending to seize the inheritance he was entitled to. He hired a lawyer to send a letter to Pan Shiqi to negotiate, but was rejected, and Pan Shiqi denied that Pan Shishou was his father's son. Pan Shishou is now seeking further legal remedies.</p>

<p>Free Talk Social Blood Donation Society Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>What is the most precious thing on a human being? The answer may vary from person to person, but the sentence "Blood is the most precious thing on a human being" is probably something no one would object to.</p>
<p>People have always regarded blood as a symbol of sacrifice, so the blood of martyrs is often remembered and never forgotten, and the precious blood of Jesus Christ has finally made Christianity spread for nearly two thousand years without decline. This shows the importance that humans attach to blood.</p>
<p>Once, in a small village in Connecticut, USA, a woman became seriously ill and was sent to a hospital in the city for treatment. Because a blood transfusion was needed, there was a public call for donors, and as a result, twenty-two people volunteered to respond. These twenty-two people waited all day at the hospital to donate blood, but nineteen of them were rejected because their blood types were incompatible.</p>
<p>One of them, named Nathan, felt that this method was too uneconomical, so he consulted with a pastor and initiated the organization of a blood donation society in Madison City. The call was widely heeded, and people who wanted to donate blood came in a continuous stream, and they only accepted sixty people as members. Chauffeurs, teachers, students, legionnaires, bank accountants, all kinds of people, everything you could want. They drew the blood and stored it in the blood bank in the hospital, which was regarded as the common property of all the people in Madison City. When poor patients needed blood transfusions, the blood donation society donated the blood. The members of the blood donation society used their blood to make all the people in the city blood relatives.</p>
<p>Some patients with better economic conditions paid the price of the blood transfusion as usual, and they saved this deposit as an emergency fund for members who became ill.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of public-spirited people willing to donate blood in other places. This kind of blood donation society can also be organized.</p>
<p>Family's Little Brother Has Half a Dozen Sisters Chen Wenyun</p>
<p>My little brother is only four years old this year. He is very smart and very talkative, so our six sisters all like him very much. Dad and Mom also, after having half a dozen daughters in a row, suddenly got this son who can be relied on in their forties, when they felt they were reaching old age, so naturally, they especially dote on him and like him especially.</p>
<p>Mom said that her little brother is the light before her feet; sometimes she said that her little brother is like a five-hundred-candlepower electric light that illuminates the whole family. In short, she thought that her little brother was the savior of the whole family. Indeed, that is the case. If I didn't have a younger brother now, then Dad would definitely take a concubine, especially since he has the grand reason that "Of the three unfilial things, having no descendants is the greatest." Fortunately, Dad read some ancient books and the like, and he has the skill of patience, and he is not very willing to listen to the advice of old busybodies in the countryside. He eagerly watched Mom's belly grow bigger day by day, and went east to have characters measured, and west to have fortunes told, busy and happy. As a result, his son's dream, which he had been longing for for ten months, completely vanished, and at the same time, third sister, fourth sister, fifth sister, and sixth sister came one after another, which really made him laugh and cry. Fortunately, he very much believed in the words of the blind fortune teller, knowing that he should have two sons in his life, and the later they came, the better, so every time he was disappointed, he would use the blind man's words to comfort himself.</p>
<p>Probably because there are often stories of getting a son by doing good deeds in old operas, Dad imitated the method and went to save the poor, buy rice tickets, and donate winter clothes.... Coincidentally, the birth of his younger brother was right after he had done good deeds, so Dad believed that his younger brother must be a star from heaven, otherwise how could it be so coincidental? So when he met friends who were in the same situation as him, he tried his best to persuade them to do good deeds and be patient, and even feared that people would not believe him, so he personally carried his younger brother to show them; therefore, all of Dad's friends knew that he had a son who he had gotten by doing good deeds. They all praised Dad, especially some female acquaintances, who were even more envious, which caused Mom and Dad to love their younger brother even more.</p>
<p>But what about us? Are we jealous because Mom and Dad are partial to our younger brother? Absolutely not: But I gradually began to hate my younger brother. It's not to say that my younger brother is not good, look, he is so cute, often calling me sister: giving me kisses with his little hands. However, what I hate is the pampered temperament and habits caused by Mom and Dad's doting. Although he is only four years old and still young, it is from this time that memories can engrave traces in his brain; his bright and excellent brain is waiting for a highly skilled craftsman to carve useful traces on it. But what about now? At the beginning, bad traces were left in his brain, how will they be washed away in the future?</p>
<p>I often hear my little brother's small mouth say: "Sister is a woman, I am a man, men are bosses, earn money, ride in cars... You women don't have any." Then he imitated the boss's smug look, which made Mom laugh and pat her younger brother's shoulder and say: "Baby, the money you earn is for Mom to use, not for your wife to use, women are the worst..." One sentence after another, in the young mind of the younger brother, he knows that only by scolding women will Mom always say he is good; later, when he goes to hit sixth sister, Mom says that women should be beaten by men. When eating, Mom says that the son should get an extra share; this makes the younger brother know the bad idea of valuing men over women, and develops a proud attitude. No one in the family dares to offend him.</p>
<p>He uses his little fist to hit Dad, and Dad laughs and says that his fist is big and he can go to beat servants in the future: he uses his little foot to kick Mom, and Mom praises him, saying that this is the demeanor of a boss. He scolds people, saying that he is smart, he hits people, saying that he is capable, so since he was born until now, in these short four years, he has learned to hit people, scold people, be proud, look down on women, servants... all kinds of young master bad tempers.</p>
<p>Although I have advised Mom and Dad not to spoil him too much, they said: "What do you want to manage? Daughters are always outsiders, and if they are kept tightly at home, they will be resigned to their fate and willing to suffer when they go out to be someone else's daughter-in-law in the future. Sons are family, the ancestors have accumulated virtue, the tombs have good feng shui, what is there to manage about him? Are you afraid that he will turn out to be so bad? He has his roots, he was cultivated in his previous life, you take care of yourself! Just don't do anything that will embarrass your brother!" Instead, I got a lecture.</p>
<p>But I still love my younger brother, and for the sake of loving my younger brother, I hate him, and at the same time, I feel sorry for him; but I have no way to save my younger brother. I only hope that Mom and Dad can wake up soon and transform my younger brother into a useful son, a son who is useful to the public.</p>
<p>Begonia Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Drawn on the Face</p>
<p>When Qiu Haitang found him there that morning, he was lying sprawled on the wooden cot, and in his heavy snoring, bursts of strong alcoholic fumes were constantly being expelled.</p>
<p>"Lao Er, can you wake up?"</p>
<p>Even when he was sound asleep, a clever person was still clever; Qiu Haitang only called him softly, and Yu Kun woke up. But when Qiu Haitang explained his intentions, he was greatly unimpressed.</p>
<p>"What's the big fuss about? I've only slept for four hours, and you've rushed me here to wake me up!" He fastened the open short coat while saying angrily.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang, with his hands behind his back, paced back and forth in the room, as if he hadn't heard anything, letting Yu Kun complain about him all the way while washing his face and changing his clothes.</p>
<p>"Because this guy has always been obsequious and clinging to me, but today he suddenly became so tough, as if he had grasped something, so I wanted to rush here to discuss it with you!" This room was really clean, without even half a stool. Every time Qiu Haitang came, he either walked around the room or leaned against the door frame like this, barely letting his body touch anything.</p>
<p>"Old brother, what's the hurry?" Yu Kun finally pulled up a pair of cloth-soled shoes with eyes and mouths on the heels, making a look of preparing to go out. "Send a few people to send him a letter today or tomorrow, tell him to be quiet, and then nothing will happen!"</p>
<p>Relying on his talent, his nimble speech, and the fact that he was quite generous when spending money, he couldn't live in Tianjin for three years. Not only did the actors who ate drama for a living praise him behind their backs, but even a few influential ruffians on the street said that Zhao Er, the owner of the Flying Grass, was a true man; therefore, in Yu Kun's eyes, a dog-relying-on-human-power orderly like Ji Zhaoxiong, as well as the unknown small gangsters he associated with, were indeed not worth caring about.</p>
<p>(8-9) Strange News Food Bank Xin Liang</p>
<p>We all know that banks are institutions for storing and withdrawing money. But did you know that in today's America, there is a new type of "food bank" that we can meet. According to statistics, one million families used this strange bank last year. When prices are low, they store beef, pork, beans, vegetables and orange juice, etc., and withdraw them when they want to eat them. This "food bank" has been in existence in the United States for five years, and its total funds have reached 30,000,000 gold dollars: it is also of great benefit to people's lives.</p>
<p>The creation of the "food bank" was born out of the previous type of cold storage, but we must not confuse it with the old method of cold storage. Experts in this field tell us: In the old method of cold storage, food is kept at zero degrees and will slowly freeze, and eventually lose its original flavor. The "food bank" does not adopt this method, but a high-speed freezing method. Because the size of ice crystals is directly proportional to the speed at which they freeze, the faster the freezing, the smaller the ice crystals, and the smaller the ice crystals, the less likely the food cells will rupture, and its color, aroma, and taste can be maintained in their original state, unaffected. The size of the "food bank" varies, with some that can simply be called "giant-sized," and all equipment is streamlined.</p>
<p>In addition to preserving the original quality of food, "food banks" also have the advantage of providing a place to store excess food. Farmers do not have to sell all their harvested food to merchants at low prices, allowing the merchants to hoard it and speculate. They can temporarily move unsold food to the bank, where there are excellent cold storage rooms to store them, and wait for the price to rise before withdrawing them.</p>
<p>In this way, the income of ordinary farmers should be higher than it is now, and they can use these extra profits to buy a few new clothes or buy a few new books and magazines.</p>
<p>This new type of business can also regulate our daily diet. When a certain seasonal item is no longer available in the market, because this type of bank exists, we can store some in advance and take it out when we want to eat it.</p>
<p>When a country goes to war, the contribution of this type of bank is even greater. We can store large quantities of military food in it for use when coastal ports are blockaded. As of the end of 1940, there were no fewer than 4,000 "food banks" in the United States; I believe that the function and effectiveness of "food banks" will be greatly developed in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Talks on Art and Entertainment: Chrysanthemum Garden Kuo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou Hong Da</p>
<p>A person can be lucky or unlucky, and opera singers are often no exception. For example, Li Wanchun, Yang Shengchun, Li Shaochun, and Gao Shenglin in the North are all short, but each of them has considerable appeal. Among the martial artists in the South, there are Kuo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou, who have never become popular in their lives because they are small. When it comes to their artistic skills, how are they any less than the several popular martial artists in the North?</p>
<p>Guo Kunquan is the grandson of Guo Xiuhua and the son of Guo Diexian. He comes from a family of actors. As a child, Kunquan used the stage name Guo Zhangyang. He could perform "Cutting Down Zidu," "Jiepai Pass," "Golden Knife Formation," "Yuehu City," and "Jiujiang Estuary." It can be said that he could perform any of them. Among them, the flying sword returning sword in "Cutting Down Zidu" is a unique skill that is foolproof. (Ru Fulan and Li Shengbin in the North can only fly the sword, but cannot return the sword. The one who can return the sword is the one who can still automatically enter the sword box after the sword is flown out.) Although he has also been on stage, he eventually returned to the entertainment venue, where he made a living by performing and also talked about opera for amateur opera lovers. His current situation is of course not very good.</p>
<p>Yuan Xiaolou is the descendant of Yuan Beifeng and also comes from a family of actors. The Opera Examination published by the China Library has a photo of a seven- or eight-year-old child actor climbing the Chaotian bench. The child actor in this photo is Yuan Xiaolou. Judging from this photo, Yuan Xiaolou's childhood skills are unmatched by any child actor. Yuan Xiaolou's plays are limited by his height, but he is excellent in short-play and arrow-robe plays. I have seen his "Cutting Down Zidu." The tumbling in the golden hall is more explosive than Ying Baolian, who became famous for throwing himself out of the table. Although Li Shengbin in the North is also famous for this play, his skills are far inferior to Yuan Xiaolou. Yuan Xiaolou's agility, flexibility of waist and legs, the appropriateness of his makeup, and the clarity of his singing are all admirable to see. Other plays such as "Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven," "Tang Huai Commits Suicide," "Pan Chang Great Battle," "Killing the Four Gates," and "Changban Slope" are all worth watching. In the Old Shanghai Dance Hall, I also saw him play Yao Gang in "Beating the Golden Bricks" for Xiao Dazi, Yu Shaoshan, and Li Wan. The wonderful somersaults, the complexity of the hammer flowers, and the agility made Li Wanchun, who played Niumao, pale in comparison. Later, I saw him sing Guan Ping in "Walking Maicheng" at the Golden Palace, and there were too many amazing things. I have seen Li Wanchun and Liang Huichao both play Guan Ping in this play for Li Hongchun, but their tumbling and falling are not as explosive as Yuan Xiaolou. The hair, kneeling steps, sitting positions, and round field are not as skillful as Yuan Xiaolou. Now he has also fallen into the entertainment venue, which is a pity!</p>
<p>If Guo Kunquan and Yuan Xiaolou were born in the North, I dare say that they would never be in their current position. Unfortunately, they grew up in Shanghai, where there happened to be many tall martial artists (such as Ying Baolian, Gai Yuting, Gao Xueqiao, Wang Yingwu, and Wang Huchen, none of whom are short). Therefore, Yuan Xiaolou and Guo Kunquan have never become popular.</p>
<p>Second Honeymoon Li Du</p>
<p>Diana Bowping and Feng Paul's wedding had been rumored for a long time. According to Hollywood movie magazines, it was originally scheduled to take place on June 9th of this year. However, for some reason, the two of them could not wait and got married earlier.</p>
<p>Bowping loves music the most, so she got married in a church. According to Bowping, the reason why she wanted to get married in a church was because she loved listening to the solemn wedding march. That day, Mendelssohn and Wenger Nair played the piano, taking turns to play two wedding marches, with extremely quiet and solemn melodies.</p>
<p>Whether it was superstition or personal preference, Bowping also wanted to have two honeymoons after the wedding. The first honeymoon was to stay in Honolulu for six months, which was similar to her situation in It's a Date. After returning from Honolulu, she would travel to New York again, where she planned to enjoy stage operas.</p>
<p>The gift that Feng Paul gave her when he announced his marriage was an exquisite diamond ring and a bracelet. Her engagement ring was also given by Feng Paul, but it was smaller. The first gift that Feng Paul gave her after the wedding was a watch.</p>
<p>An Outline of the Philosophy of Action Li Xing</p>
<p>Movement is the source of life, and life is the result of movement. Whoever leaves movement has no future. Because without movement there is no life, and without life there is destruction. This is an iron law. The so-called non-birth and non-extinction, beyond the scope of movement, seeking its existence, is just a kind of fantasy!</p>

<p>Chapter 7: Why Are Attacking Cities and Killing Generals So Chaotic?</p>
<p>Yi and Li Xin killed their way out of the Yanshu and set off a signal cannon to gather their men. Just as they were about to rush out of the city, they heard a呜呜 sound of bugles on the street to the west, followed by bright torches and a chaotic mix of people and horses. It turned out that General Feng heard the bad news of the prison break and summoned his troops to encircle and capture them. Li Xin said to Hong Niangzi, "The government troops are coming. Where should we go?" Hong Niangzi said, "Don't panic. I'll resist for a while. My brother's men will be here soon." As the two were speaking, the government troops had already rushed from the opposite alley. The streets of Qixian were very narrow, with no room to maneuver, and both sides were already visible. General Feng was a young and strong general, in full military attire, riding a yellow horse, and holding a large broadsword. Seeing a group of bandits from Qing Shi Mountain on the opposite side, armed and lined up, he shouted loudly, urged his horse, and charged straight at them. Hong Niangzi raised her sword to meet him and shouted娇, "Hong Niangzi is here!" General Feng had heard of Hong Niangzi's name, and knew that she often wore red and was extremely brave. Now, seeing the woman coming to kill him under the firelight, although she was very beautiful, she was wearing black, and he seemed a little suspicious. But hearing her call herself Hong Niangzi, he dared not neglect her, and raised his broadsword, aiming at her head to chop down. Hong Niangzi would not let him, and her sword danced. General Feng fought fiercely back and forth. The government troops under General Feng followed and charged up, and Li Xin and his men went forward to meet them, and the two sides fought in the alley. General Feng's martial arts were very good, but because of the alley war, he had no room to gallop. Hong Niangzi was agile, and her sword was very nimble, suddenly in front, suddenly behind the horse, tiring General Feng with sweat all over his head, and he knew that the name Hong Niangzi was indeed worthy of the name. Li Xin also used his Pu Dao to open up his skills and stabbed down three or four government soldiers. Just as they were in a stalemate, three signal cannons were fired outside the city, and someone came to report to General Feng's army, saying that a large number of men from Qing Shi Mountain had killed their way to outside the city of Qixian, there were few soldiers on the city and few people to guard it, and the city gate was about to be taken. General Feng got this news, and he did not know how many men had come from Qing Shi Mountain, there were both in the city and outside the city, and he was very flustered. He made a false move and ran away with his horse. Hong Niangzi looked back at Li Xin and said with a smile, "My brother is here, let's rush up and take this city of Qixian while we have the chance."</p>

<p>In I Wanted Wings, there are several scenes that are very dangerous. This is a great air combat film. The stars William Holden and Wayne Morris were both covered with fireproof burn oil. The makeup was done by Hollywood's most famous makeup expert, Max Factor.</p>
<p>Bette Davis plays the world's most miserable orphan in her new film The Great Lie. There were several crying scenes that indeed made it impossible for her to work on the set the next day because her eye nerves were too tired. This film will probably earn a small number of viewers' tears again.</p>
<h3>Medical Stories</h3>
<p>— Qingping</p>
<p>Taking medicine after becoming ill is not as good as preventing illness early and maintaining health.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, missionary medical personnel from Western churches in China organized the "Medical Association," led by foreigners, to oversee medical affairs in China. This included promoting medical education, improving medical facilities, and disseminating health knowledge, thus laying the foundation for modern medicine in our country. People of insight then began to study Western medical techniques, and the public gradually learned to seek treatment from Western doctors. Consequently, Western medicine began to sprout in our country. At that time, advanced medical professionals who had studied abroad and returned to China believed that although the efforts and achievements of foreigners who were in charge of China's medical affairs were worthy of admiration, it was not an ideal solution. Chinese people should have their own medical organizations, and China's medical affairs should be managed by Chinese people. Thus, they organized the Chinese Medical Association, which now has nearly thirty years of history. After the establishment of the Chinese Medical Association, the Missionary Medical Association, organized by foreigners, dissolved. Foreign medical experts still strongly supported the development of the Chinese Medical Association. It now has three thousand members, including six hundred foreign members. This is the national academic medical institution, and with the strong support of the government, it has made significant contributions to our country's medical affairs. The association's address is at 41 Zhuhong Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association possesses a very rich collection of our country's ancient medical literature, including photos, models, idols, medical instruments, medical books, and more of ancient Chinese medicine. According to Wang Jimin, President of the Chinese Medical History Association, the Chinese Medical Association has the best collection of Chinese medical books. People from the traditional Chinese medicine community often go there to borrow and consult them. These ancient medical documents were collected and gathered by Wang over the years and have been carefully researched.</p>
<p>After Dr. Ouyang Zhong accompanied me on a tour of the two medical museum rooms, an outline of the history of Chinese medicine emerged in my mind.</p>
<p>In a small room upstairs, important figures and patterns from the history of medicine were hung on the surrounding walls. There was a comparison of Chinese and foreign medical history. Since our country's Yellow Emperor wrote the Inner Canon and initiated medicine, and Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and obtained medical knowledge (2400 BC), up to the medical theories of the Five Elements (1000 BC) and the Eight Trigrams (500 BC), and then Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Tuo of the Han Dynasty (the time of Jesus's birth), Chinese medicine greatly flourished. Zhang Zhongjing of the Han Dynasty was our country's master of internal medicine, and his Treatise on Cold Damage is still regarded as a classic of national medicine. Hua Tuo once scraped bone to treat General Guan Yu of the Three Kingdoms, pioneering anesthesia in our country and becoming a master of surgery in our country. In another frame was a genuine prescription written by the famous physician Ye Tianshi of the Qing Dynasty. He was famous for treating plagues, using pungent and cold substances to open blockages, and fragrant substances to expel impurities. He was the ancestor of plague treatment in our country. There was a portrait of Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty, who spent twenty-seven years completing the unprecedented Chinese medical masterpiece "Compendium of Materia Medica," which is the culmination of Chinese medicine. In addition, there was a drawing of the so-called "pulse diagnosis by thread," depicting a "doctor" and several maids. The maids held a thread in their hands, and the "doctor" pressed on the thread to take the pulse and diagnose the condition. Because ancient China was bound by old ethics, and men and women were not allowed to touch each other, if a young lady in her boudoir unfortunately fell ill, she could not reveal her fair skin to the doctor. Her delicate jade arm could not be given to the doctor to take the pulse. So, a clever method was devised in stubborn minds. A silk thread was used. One maid tightly pressed one end of the thread on the part of the sick lady's jade arm where the pulse was, and another maid held the other end of the thread and led it to the outer room of the bedroom. The doctor pressed the pulse in the middle of the thread. The thread slightly jumped with the pulse's movement, and the doctor diagnosed the condition based on the thread's jumping and prescribed medicine accordingly. The doctor never saw how pale and haggard the sick lady actually was. This kind of "pulse diagnosis by thread" is of the same nature as another method of diagnosis using nude female models. If a lady had a disease in a certain part of her body, the patient's family would point it out to the doctor on this nude model, and then the doctor would prescribe medicine based on the diseased part of the model that was pointed out. In ancient times, when women got sick, they were treated in this unsatisfactory way. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Tianjin Road Joint Savings Bank Was Bombed and Shot at Yesterday; Both Sides Exchanged Fire for a Long Time, and the Situation Was Tense; the Watchman and Security Guard Were Both Shot and Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 9:30 AM, six men suddenly appeared at the Joint Savings Commercial Bank at 201 Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession. They took out pistols and revolvers and started shooting inside. One of them threw two hand grenades inside, but they did not explode. As soon as the shooting started, the bank's guard, Lang Deming (age 47, from Jiangsu), and security guards also drew their guns and returned fire. A fierce gun battle erupted, with both sides firing a total of more than 40 shots. Neighbors and pedestrians were terrified and fled in all directions. The men, seeing that they had no chance of succeeding, fled, boarded a car that was waiting for them, and sped away. After the incident, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, who rushed to the scene and sent Lang Deming, who was wounded in the shooting, and security guard Chen Afang (age 36) to Renji Hospital for treatment. Lang was hit by two bullets in the back and head, while Chen was shot in the left finger and suffered minor injuries. Several panes of the bank's glass windows were shattered. Stray bullets also penetrated the Yuanmao Ginseng Shop at 190 opposite the bank, breaking the glass windows, but fortunately no one was injured. It was also reported that the police had found one revolver, two pistols, and two unexploded hand grenades at the scene of the incident, which were all taken to the police station for storage.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Was Discovered at the Ruiji Flour Shop; the Bomber Was Intercepted</h3>
<p>The Ruiji Flour Shop at 127 North Zhejiang Road, named Ruilu, is owned by Pan Ruijie from Baoshan. It has its own car, license plate number 3524. Recently, it has been coveted by bandits. On the 24th of last month, several kidnappers attempted to kidnap Pan at the entrance of the shop. Fortunately, the driver was alert and Pan was saved from being kidnapped, but the kidnappers fired a shot at Pan, hitting his right ankle. The bandits then fled. At around 7:40 this morning, a strong man suddenly placed a paper package behind the Ruiji shop and fled north. As he fled to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road, he was spotted by Hua San Daotou, number 1087, and Hua Police 3012, who were stationed at the entrance of the First Special Court by the Huizi Police Station to provide protection. Seeing that the man was flustered and did not appear to be a good person, they immediately chased after him and captured him. At this time, the Ruiji shop had also discovered that the paper package contained a bomb and immediately took it to the police station. After interrogation, the man identified himself as Zheng Huili, a local. A warrant was issued to arrest his accomplices for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Broke into the Guide Agency and Opened Fire; a Noodle Stall Owner Was Shot and Killed; a Partner Was Shot in the Leg</h3>
<p>Last night around 10:00 PM, three men, all armed with pistols, broke into the Taotao Guide Agency at No. 10, Guangxi Road (i.e., Jingqinfang). One of them stood guard outside. The guide girls inside the agency saw the two men with pistols and were terrified, shouting for help. The man who was standing guard outside suspected that something had happened and ran away. The three men then fled into the darkness. When the men fired their guns, the bullets flew in all directions. Chen Pinfa, who owned a noodle stall in front of the Taotao Agency, was hit first, with four shots to the chest. Because the bullets hit vital organs, he collapsed in a pool of blood and died on the spot. Two partners of the noodle stall, Shu Pinfang, age 36, from Changzhou, and Han Zhiben, age 19, also from Changzhou, were both shot and wounded in the leg. After the Chinese police reported the incident to the police station, detectives were dispatched to investigate. The body of Chen Pin and the two partners were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because Chen Pinfa could not be saved, his body was sent to the morgue to await examination.</p>
<h3>A Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning in the Shanghai New Hotel</h3>
<p>Room 200 of the Shanghai New Hotel at 579 Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession was occupied by a young man and woman. The male guest was named Chen Yiming, age 20, a local, and the female guest was named Wang Huizhen, age 17, a local. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the waiter discovered that both the man and woman had committed suicide by swallowing poison. He immediately called an ambulance and sent the two to Renji Hospital for treatment. Chen Yiming died before reaching the hospital due to severe poisoning. Wang Huizhen's life was in critical condition. The reason for their suicide was said to be unhappiness over an arranged marriage.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Food Snatching Cases Occur Daily</h3>
<p>Since the price of rice and coal has been illegally manipulated, residents' lives have been greatly threatened. The number of beggars along the streets has also increased significantly. Because it is difficult to beg for alms, the trend of snatching food on the streets and alleys has become rampant. Snatching is considered normal, especially in small vegetable markets. Even in the Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road area, where there are usually many police and detectives and the streets are crowded with pedestrians, a dozen or so cases of snatching food packages and other items occur daily. According to detailed statistics, there are over a thousand food snatching incidents daily. According to an economist, the occurrence of these incidents is purely a result of hoarding and speculation, which greatly disrupts public order.</p>
