<h3>從夏令攝生至於免疫</h3>
<p>合有季節性之眞性霍亂，最近已有發見，雖亦有從外埠傳染而來，但本埠旣有此病症即有此細菌之存在，難保不滋生蔓延，爲患人羣。何况霍亂之季節方始，不圖善爲防治，以上海居室狹窄，戶口稠密，尤恐勢成燎原，不可嚮邇。他如傷寒白喉肺癆，亦較戰前患者爲多。似此情形，上海公衆健康，實至可慮。所幸地方當局能盡其最大之努力，社會熱心公益人士及公團機關，亦能互助共濟，預防疫癘。上海得不至大兵之後，發生大疫者以此。</p>
<p>顧一究病源之癥結所在；人口麕集於一隅，斗室蜂戶，濁氣熏染，利於疾病之傳染，有害身體之健康一也。物價飛漲無止境，所入每不足敷所出，於是飲食節的簡陋之自然結果，而營養不足，易爲病魔所浸襲，二也。其有享用優裕，又每以飲食不節，起居無常，浪漫生活，而斲傷其生機，轉爲疾患所乘者；三也。儘多生活艱難，啼飢號寒，日坐愁城，籌思無計，因心緒抑鬱，體力衰弱，而成癆瘵者；四也。凡此，皆生活問題之爲患；優則放僻邪侈而成疾，孽由自取，貧則百無聊賴而致病，非盡人爲，豈非天命？</p>
<p>因生活問題而起之疾病，實無療治之最善方法，蓋惟有改善生活，恢復原狀，則諸患自除。目前所可言，仍只有治標一法，有如防疫運動之照常進行，防疫設備之多事籌備。此外較有治本性質者，愼起居，節飲食。雖二者跡近常談，正惟其常，易爲人所忽，而不念適爲養生之大經起居有常，飲食有節，人生之正規也。然都市生活，易於反常，俾晝作夜，習爲固然。每當夏令，逭暑納凉，允易流於夜生活。體魄壯健者一時固無礙，孱弱者輒易疾作。若以爲生活優遊，可行所無忌。而不念專制時代之帝皇。至尊也；享用，至優也；間嘗就秦始以來，建號稱帝傳世者，共得一百八十三，其中不明其享年短長者十六；然卒於二十歲至四十歲之間者，得六十九人，竟占百分之四十而强。大抵創業有爲之主多長壽；叔季中庸之君多短命。元室，蒙古强族也，然除忽必烈享年八十之外，其他諸帝，平均享年，不過三十齡，明太祖享年七十一歲，而就以後諸帝平均年齡亦不過四十三。淸如康熙以至道光，皆享高年，咸同光三期，又皆不壽。夫以帝皇之生活，至低限度，宜可克盡天年；而事竟不然，安知不爲縱情欲而起居飲食無常之爲害。都市富家鉅室，極度享受，無殊帝皇，觀於上所舉述，當知縱欲喪生，荒嬉無益，而憬然知所以發奮圖强之道也。</p>
<p>夏令喜冷食，人情至常也。取快於一時口腹，害有不可勝言者。傷寒之流行，腹疾之爲患，卒寒卒熱，病菌每易從冷食而入。故浮瓜沉李，雪藕冰淇，爲可消暑；孰如熟食沸飲，靜待其凉，轉可殺菌。要知人身之體溫，不爲氣溫而多所高低；氣溫高至與體溫相近，頻呼大熱；若高於體溫，則近於百度上下之氣溫，已爲罕見。而乃冬令則用爐，夏日則飲冰，隨氣候爲轉移，不顧寒熱之刺戟腸胃，其不合於衛生也可知。</p>
<p>竊以爲防疫莫如衛生；今年暑候較長，而未暑之候，疾疫已有發生，則於未來之攝生問題，可不深加之意。保一已之健康，即所以保公衆之健康；防一家之無疫，即所以蘄全社會之免疫，是故起居飲食之間，允宜三致意焉。</p>

<p>塔斯社四日莫斯科電　蘇聯國防委員會長斯達林、七月三日在無綫電中發表演說、原文如下、</p>
<p>「同志·公民·兄弟姊妹·海陸軍人員、余現向諸君廣播演說、德國希特勒向吾祖國進行之背信攻擊、業於六月二十二日開始、目前在繼續中、吾紅軍雖英勇抵抗、而敵方之最優空軍及最精銳陸軍雖亦被擊毀、並在戰塲中遇其末日、但敵仍增派生力軍隊繼續推進、希特勒軍隊已佔立陶宛·拉得維亞之一部·白俄羅斯西部·及西烏克蘭之一部、法西斯空軍亦擴大其轟炸範圍、猛轟茂曼斯克·奥波沙·莫奇萊夫·斯摩倫斯克·基輔·奥迪薩及西巴斯託託巴爾、</p>
<p>吾國現巳遭遇嚴重危機、吾光榮的紅軍果何由而放棄若干城市耶、德法西斯軍隊果具有法西斯宣傳家所不斷自詡之無敵特質乎、歷史證明世無常勝不敗之軍、拿破侖軍隊被視爲無敵、但卒爲俄英德軍隊相繼擊潰、在第一次帝國主義戰爭時、德威廉二世之軍隊亦曾被視爲無敵、但亦爲俄軍及英法軍隊擊敗數决、最後仍被英法聯軍所粉碎、今日之希特勒法西斯軍亦然、此種軍隊在隊洲大陸迄未遭遇堅强之抵抗、祇在吾領土內始遭遇堅强反抗、苟此項堅決抵抗結果已使希特勒最精銳之部隊被紅軍所擊敗、則此種軍隊亦必一如拿破侖及威廉軍隊而被粉碎、</p>
<p>至於吾領土一部份之被佔領、此乃由於戰爭開始時情形利於德軍而不利於吾方、德係戰爭國、軍隊完全動員、遣至蘇聯邊境之一百七十師軍隊全部完成準備、僅候令進攻、反之、蘇聯軍隊尚待動員而未遣至邊境、關於此方面、尚有一點亦殊重要、法西斯德國突然背信違反一九三九年所締結之不侵犯公的、此種行動雖已使德國被視爲侵略者、但德方決置世界輿論於不顧、酷愛和平之吾國旣不願首先毀的、當不能採取不忠不義之奸詐行動、然則蘇維埃政府何以允與奸詐的希特勒及里賓特洛甫締結不侵犯公約耶、豈非蘇聯本身之過歟、非也、不侵犯公的實乃兩國間之和平協定、一九三九年德方向吾所建議者亦即此類協定、蘇維埃政府果能拒絕此種建議乎、本人認爲凡酷愛和平之國家、決無拒絕與隣國締結和平協定之理由、即使該隣國之首腦亦係希特勒及里賓特洛甫之流亦不能斷然拒絕與之締的、雖然、蘇聯締結此種協定、亦有一種必需之條件、易言之、即此種和平條的並不直接或間接侵害酷愛和平國家之領土完整·獨立·及光榮、蘇德不侵犯公的亦即含有此種性質之條的、然則吾人與德締的、果已獲得何種利益耶、菩人已爲吾國獲得一年半之和平及軍事準備、以防法西斯德國違的冒險向吾國進攻、此點對吾絕對有利、對法西斯德國則大爲不利、</p>
<p>然則德毀的之得失叉若何、德軍已獲得短時期之優越地位、但在政治方面、德法西斯已自暴其猙獰面目、被全世界視爲殘忍之敵人矣無疑的、德方此種短期軍事收穫祇係偶然之事、而蘇聯之偉大政治收穫、則係一種永久的因素、促使紅軍獲得決定性的軍事成功、目前吾英勇紅軍海軍以及歐美亞三洲、甚至德國優秀民衆、均一致痛斥德法西斯之背信行爲、對蘇聯政府則表示同情、同時並認爲吾人係爲正義而戰、敵人必被擊潰勝利必屬於吾、</p>
<p>此次迫使吾人加入之戰爭、已使吾國與其最兇惡最無信義之敵人德法西斯主義作殊死戰、吾軍與備有坦克及飛機之敵人英勇作戰、掃除無數困難、即每一寸國土亦不輕易放棄、紅軍主力即將開始參加動作、彼等備有無數祖克及飛機、紅軍士兵表現極大果敢、吾人之抵抗力已日益增强、而全體蘇維埃民衆亦一致奮起保衛本國領土、吾人如何方能渡過難關擊潰敵人耶、最要者、蘇維埃民衆必須明瞭吾國所感受威脅之深切、而放棄一切自滿輕率心理以及和平建設工作、良以戰爭已改變一切、戰前所適用者現巳不復適用、敵人殘忍與吾人有不可和解之深仇、彼現已出動圖奪吾汗血所滋潤之土地及吾人勞動所獲之五穀及油類、彼欲恢復地主之統制及帝俄主義、毀滅吾文化及俄羅斯·烏克蘭·白俄羅斯·立陶宛·拉特維亞·愛沙尼亞·烏士貝克·塔泰等蘇聯自由民族之生存、使其易爲德皇子及公爵之奴役、由是覜之、此次戰爭實係蘇維埃國家及蘇聯人民生死存亡之鬥爭、蘇聯是吾繼續享受自懷、抑或淪爲奴役、亦繫於此决戰爭、蘇維埃民衆必須明瞭此點、並應棄絕一切輕率心理、彼等應動員本身力量、依照戰時需要重新組織工作、對敵人決不應寬恕、</p>
<p>尤要者、在吾人陣綫中、決不應有懦夫及逃避者、吾人在戰爭中、應具大無畏精神、並必須立卽參加此决爲自由於而戰之愛國鬥爭、消滅專事奴役他人之法西斯主義、吾偉大創國元勳列寗會謂蘇維埃民衆之優點、應爲果敢·無畏·並準備與其他民族並肩向吾敵人作戰、此種布爾什維之特點、應展及紅軍、海軍及蘇聯各民族、吾人」切工作應立卽依照戰時辦法予以整頓、一切均應符合前綫之需要及毀滅敵人之工作、德法西斯主義極端仇視予勞動大衆以自由及繁榮之吾國、蘇聯民衆必須一致奮起向敵人作戰、保衛其奎權及領土、紅軍紅色海軍以及所有蘇聯公民、必須堅守每一寸之蘇維埃領土、以最後一滴血保衛城鎮、並表現吾人傳統之果敢及聰慧、吾人必須全力援助紅軍、保證以生力軍及供養接濟紅軍軍隊及軍用品之運輸以及救護傷兵等項、亦應力求改進、吾人必須增强紅軍之後方、所有工作均須以此爲出發點、吾人所有工業應加緊工作、製造大量子彈槍械及飛機、各工廠各電廠等、吾人應嚴密予以看守、並改進防空工作、同時吾人對後方之逃避者、造謠者、以及敵方間諜傘兵等、應加以消滅及掃蕩、</p>
<p>吾人須知敵人極爲狡滑、並善於奸詐及散播謠言、切勿爲此種奸計所逞、凡膽怯者以及阻礙國防工作者、無論其爲何人、一律由軍事法庭法辦、紅軍苟在不得已而撤退時、所有車輛必須退出、卽一輛火車、一磅五穀或一加侖汽油亦不得遺下、任從敵人利用、集體農民應驅散所有牲口、並將五穀交與當局運往後方、至於不能移去之貴重物件、如非鐵金屬·五穀·及汽油等必須加以毀滅、在敵佔領　內、應組織游擊隊、在各地發動游擊戰、毀壞橋樑公路並焚毀商店及運貨車輛、總之、一切務使敵人無法立足、此决戰爭決不能比諸尋常戰爭、此不僅係兩軍交戰、且係全體蘇聯民衆向法西斯之鬥爭、作戰目的亦不僅爲消除吾國之本身危檄、且亦將援助在德法西斯主義束縛下呻吟之人民、在此决爲自由而戰之戰爭中、吾人決不孤立無援、在此决戰爭中、吾人將獲得歐美及被希特勒奴役德人之忠誠合作、</p>
<p>吾人之自由戰爭與歐亞之獨立及民主自由戰爭已混合爲一、成爲反希特勒之聯合陣綫、關於此點、英首相之援蘇言論及美政府準備援助吾國之宣言、已引起蘇聯民衆之感謝、且極易使人瞭解、</p>
<p>同志、吾人之力量無窮、敵人對於此點即將感悟、無數工人農民及文化份子已一致奮起、與紅軍並肩向敵人作戰、莫斯科及列寗格拉之勞動大衆、巳開始微集大量國民軍援助紅軍、凡感受侵略威脅之各城市、均應成立此種國民軍、吾人應喚起勞動大衆保衛自山·光榮·及國家、爲迅速動員蘇聯民衆力量擊退敵人起見、吾人已組織國防委會、該會得以全權處理國事、國防委會已開始工作、並請求民衆加緊擁護列寗、斯達林黨及政府、並援助紅軍海軍藉以擊潰敵人獲得勝利、一切力量應用以援助英勇紅軍及光榮的紅色海軍、一切力量應用以毀滅敵人前進、向勝利之途前進、</p>

<h3>紗花　皮球走氣　現紗巿塲頓感凄凉　實銷亦以扳價太厲而呈僵局</h3>
<p>紗市自空頭倒閉以後、市塲皮球交易、大爲走氣、幸而尚未破裂、所以變成相打無對手、要進買不進、欲出賣不出、昔日之熱鬧非凡、今則又轉變散漫之象矣、同時現紗生意、不及上日之鼎盛、實則貨主扳價殊厲、客幫無從下手也、因之遂呈僵持之局面、即今日須運往香港者亦僅一百八十件、就此而論、雙馬市塲恐有一度冷淡後復轉興旺之路耳、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百二十五元、低價爲一千五百八十八元、午後人丁稀散、叫喊價目不一、初做一千五百九十一二元、旋爲一千六百元左右、成交微乎其微也、肇興紗廠開出十八支織女紗價爲一千二百六十五元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣尙好、首盤價為一千六百二十元少頃跌至一千六百十七八元、旋聞標金開盤尚良好、升至一千六百二十五元、但客銷平凡、盈利者吐出、同時各交易所行市不振、賣風益熾、逐步下降至一千五百九十二元收盤、查半日間成交統計五千三百十包、內香港幫進三百十包、同行皮球生意五千包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗市况、開盤近跌遠升、旋以現紗交易不旺、引起盈利人吐出而回下、結果七月期跌二十一元、八月期跌九元、九月期反漲六元、查全日成交統計二萬四千包、比前增五千九百八十包、茲將其一日間高低及收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉巿漲勢銷平</h3>
<p>現棉情况、因連朝飛騰、今因紗市回挫、氣勢稍帶平態、不過同行互相買賣、共計有九百件、價漲二三元、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以廠方及花號購意不惡、現棉成交仍暢、四十支原料美國加州棉及高級巴西棉售價均近四百九十元左右、昨日除華商廠方及花號購進大量巴西棉及美棉外、日商紗廠購意更屬殷切、成交不下千包以上、至於遠期外棉定購情况、則因來源受阻、運輸不易而有遜色，市價亦不若現棉之猛烈高挺也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布頗有　獲利轉賣</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市回跌、乃受東疋影響、人心仍堅、獲利各貨頗有轉賣、結果白貨細布斜紋每疋跌二角半至五角、粗布跌二角半、漂染布均鮮上落、本街成交秋令期貨絨布坯布等三百餘件、府綢漂布色布粗布等二百餘件、粵港南洋幫辦漂染印花各布五百餘件、五日有疋頭三百件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　昨市先漲後跌、起伏仍鉅、細布因取引所期貨猛落、龍頭現棧單亦跟踪下挫、後市收盤價爲四十八元九角、較跌七角、但中檔各牌細布則以實銷不寂、同業心思仍好、僅跌每疋五角許、細斜亦見堅穩、藍雙魚染需尤俏、反漲五角、四君子嗶嘰晨市升至一元六角五分、嗣以利空消息、壓小至一元六角、終因大戶吸收、回升至一元六角二分、價無榮辱、</p>

<h3>二期港米售價未定　公倉米今天埠　米號避免分量糾紛改用巿秤</h3>
<p>本埠連日又有大批洋米湧到、據航業界確息、衛利韓公司代理之萬爾納將軍號（S．S．G．G．A．Varenne）、近由越運米來滬、因途遇颶風、展延三日、的於今日可到埠、預定停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、共載來仰光米三四·〇〇〇包、又挪　商貨輪格蘭號（Gran）、亦因風展期、大的今日下午亦可到埠、該輪由仰光載來洋米二七·一五〇包、預定靠浦東其昌棧、該輪之緬甸洋米、係工部局之公介米、</p>
<p>米號發售巿秤為憑</p>
<p>目下兩租界當局對於各零售米號私抬售價、及尅扣斤量之事、極爲注意、前後已有多家米號、因查出舞弊有據、送經法院處罰、因之兩租界有一部份米店、爲避免有同樣事件發生、特懸牌聲明、謂以後出售米糧、當以市秤爲憑、共原文如下、「本號出售平價洋米、及各秤食米、避免糾紛起見、凡滿五斗以上者、概用市秤磅出、不用斗量、希各主顧注意、平價洋米每斗十六市斤、其他食米、每斗十五斤十兩、</p>
<p>二期港米商討售價</p>
<p>至工部局第二期洋米、亦已在香港裝輪繼續運滬、首批下周即可抵滬、是項洋米之批價、據聞因仰光至香港水脚增加、故每包亦須增加四元、惟未證實、短斯問不致影饗門售原定米價、因常局一再聲明、須待第一期洋米及公倉米完全售罄後、始召集會議、商討變更門售價格也、</p>
<h3>華北郵票被鐫印地名　係北平郵局所爲　於郵政系統攸關</h3>
<p>北平郵局、遽將在北平·山西·山東·河南·蘇北·五地郵局所發航空郵票、於票面上鐫蓋地名、此舉於整個郵政系統、殊足注意、大通社記者、茲探錄其情如左、</p>
<p>郵票式樣全國一律</p>
<p>全國各地郵局之郵票、均由昆明郵政總局所發、係由香港承印、俗稱香港版郵票、是項郵票、各淪陷區域郵票、均照貼用、在河北方面、則由總局發交北平郵政管理局、由該局分發山西·山東·河南·蘇北·各地郵局出售、供民衆貼用、</p>
<p>北平郵局加印地名</p>
<p>最近北平郵局、以華北現所使用之籌碼、頗佔相當數字、是項幣値、現與日方軍用票同等、而法幣在華北、則被强制抑低、以此頗有人將郵票帶至華北、折換當地籌碼、北平郵局視爲侵蝕郵局權益、</p>
<p>昨日本埠開始發現</p>
<p>緣上項原因、竟在郵票上加印河北·山西·山東·河南·蘇北·五處地名、上項印字郵票、始許在各該省境內之郵局貼用、無地名者、拒絕流通、此舉於郵局行政系統攸關、殊足重視、至是項郵票、上海市上、昨已開始發現、字形頗大、係以隸書鐫、</p>
<p>大生輪旅客上岸</p>
<p>試航溫州之大生輪、在甌江口被阻後、已迫駛舟山洋面停泊、代理該輪之公司常局、雖已提出交涉、但日方態度堅持、未予釋放、頃據探悉、搭乘該輪之旅客、已在定海上岸、將由於定海搭輪往寗波、再設法來滬、並悉溫州當局、獲悉該輪在甌江口被扣、爲嚴禁航輪貿然開航、已電溫旅滬同鄉團體、轉知航商、不再派輪駛往溫州、</p>
<h3>銀行減息已有明確規定　參酌巿面情形各自決定　規定最低額取消優待制</h3>
<p>各銀行鑒於上海游資充斥、而缺乏正常投資之途、爲避免坐耗利息、减輕負擔起見、自三十年下半期起、各行參酌市面情形、减低利息、取消優待給息辦法、但並不完全一律、浙江興業銀行已將支票存款息减爲週息二厘、新華銀行規定餘額每日在五百元以下者、概不給息、聞各銀行活存息已啊遍减爲四厘、領用支票息减爲二厘、定期息一年者爲七厘、活期每日結存數滿五百元、加息一厘辦法均已取消、凡存款過期不取不於期外計息、續存如逾期咨照、概不追補原期、惟定期存款、已與存戶訂立利息者、則照訂立之利率計算、滿期後如續存、則照新率計算、</p>

<h3>駭人聽聞之血案　崗捕殺人不眨眼　連殺三人後自戕　擅離崗位闖入居戶行兇　槍殺靑年夫婦及大學生　三人先後畢命案情奇突</h3>
<p>年來滬埠暗殺案、層出不窮、然未有若有昨日梅白格路之華捕一名開槍先後連擊三人、然後擎槍自戕、亦吿傷重身死之大血案、誠駭人聽聞、事後該案原因雖尙不明、但據一般觀測諒係私仇、或事涉桃色、爰將該案經過詳情、錄誌於後、</p>
<p>即殺其夫復擊乃妻</p>
<p>昨日午前十一時五十分、有値崗於梅白格路靜安寺路之新閘捕房二一〇〇號華捕懷某、私離崗位、闖入梅白格路卅八弄十八號住戶孫晋元家、時孫正熟睡床中、好夢方酣、不料懷潛至床前、出公事手槍、向孫連開四槍、均命中頭胸等部、立刻慘死床中、懷見目的已達、遂囊槍而逃、</p>
<p>即殺其夫復擊乃妻</p>
<p>當逃至房門口、忽見孫妻王氏（廿四歲）、手提菜筐、由菜塲歸來、乃又陡起殺心、向氏開槍二響轟擊、氏不及躱避、遂被命中頭部及腹部、立時踣倒地上、鮮血四濺、奄奄一息、斯時該捕連殺二人、該號住戶、雖目覩行兇、但均已噤若寒蟬、紛粉逃避、更無人敢呼警、捕此兇徒、</p>
<p>狀若瘋狂又殺秦理</p>
<p>懷連擊二人後、類若瘋在、適是時迎面有現在之江大學肄業之無錫人秦理（廿四歲）緩步而來、該捕乃叉開放手槍、將其擊倒、當塲被擊中頭額一槍、彈入腦際、立刻傷重斃命、橫屍於十八號之門口地上、該捕見秦又斃命、自知槍殺三人、罪無可逭、遂起自殺之念、因槍內子彈已用完、再由身畔取出子彈匣插入槍內、即舉槍對準太陽穴、連開二槍</p>
<p>兇手自戕案情離奇</p>
<p>上項大血案發生後然、時捕房亦已得訊、派大枇探捕趕往、召救護車將孫秦懷死屍三具車送寳隆醫院、轉送騐屍所候騐、王氏送寳隆醫院治療、傷勢甚危險、據事後獲悉孫夫婦方於二月前結婚、孫現年廿三歲、現正失業家居、因何被殺、原因不明、至死者秦理、一說係與捕同往孫家者、旋孫被擊後復同出、而復遭捕槍殺者、秦家寓威海衛路六四一號、與懷捕及孫晋元有何關係、現捕房因案情重大、已飭屬嚴查是案內幕、</p>

<h3>絕交以前所訂德貨　滬商請免禁運　由公會證明俾運入內地　德商擬改道運德貨來華</h3>
<p>德國對華貿易、向佔重要地位、德貨之運華、以染料顏料油漆凡立水爲大宗、化學產品及製藥决之、金屬機械車輛船艇再决之、中國土貨輸德、以動物及動物產品與大豆花生等居多數、</p>
<p>德貨輸華現無通路</p>
<p>自歐戰發生後、中國貿易、因水路運輸綫中斷、逐漸衰落、自第四位退至第十四位、惟顏料與西藥、因爲中國必需之品、均由於西伯利亞鐵路轉運上海、再由上海轉入各內地、自穗蘇宣戰後、無論德貨之運華、以及華貨之輸德、均因交通遮斷而全停、新聲社記者昨向顏料及西藥業探悉、德貨如顏料西藥等、在上海存貨爲數頗多、暫時不致感受缺乏、大德拜耳謙信天利等洋行存貨堆積、而經營顏料西藥各行號、亦持有鉅額存貨、惟價格因來源中斷、囤貨者抬價不肯出售、以致再漲二成至三成、</p>
<p>仰光香港均禁轉口</p>
<p>惟目前德貨之輸入自由區域頗爲困難、因仰光香港等地、均禁止德貨轉口、聞各顏料西藥商、自中國政府宣佈與德絕交後、擬請求政府對以前購入之穗貨、准予證明、機續運銷中國境內、凡已成交訂立契終而未到達之德貨、亦包括在內、以利華商貿易、關於證明手續、由各業同業公會負責辦理之、</p>
<p>德進口商籌闢新綫</p>
<p>蘇德戰事發生後、本市德國藥品顏料等、因來源發生恐慌、暴漲不已、惟昨據德商洋行方面消息、德商進口行家、對於德貨運輸路綫、正在竭力設法、此後德貨或將經德義等口岸裝法義日等國航輪、運至南美各國、然後再運往日本轉運來滬、如此舉能實現、則運輸時間與經濟、將較經由西比利亞運華時稍增、</p>
<h3>斜橋附近　發現砲彈　及手溜彈兩枚</h3>

<h3>工部局限制用電　電影商決力爭　反對將影院列入奢侈類　擬設法使歸入實業類中</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局前爲限制界內用電起見、曾特設委員會、規定各類電力用戶、就其是否需要而定電力供給之限制量、當時電影院被列人「奢侈」類中、其電力供給有减少大半之虞、</p>
<p>認為歧視</p>
<p>各影片分銷商、以事關營業殊巨、特致函工部局、對此「歧視計劃」表示反對、局方乃於上月廿五日會議中決定、將電影院除出奢侈類、茲悉影片分銷商對此尚未滿意、而認工部局限制電力計劃、仍具歧視性質、故擬設法使電影院永久歸入「實業」類中、彼等將吾再向局方申請、現尚未悉、但負責方面傳影片商刻正繼續努力、務求電影院獲得公允平等的電力供給、</p>
<p>影響殊巨</p>
<p>又英文大美晚報云、本巿美商八大影片分銷公司主任、昨日（三日）集議、討論結果、認爲工部局雖已將電影院不歸入奢侈類中、但各電影院之電力供給、仍有减少什七之虞、果爾、各院每日祇能放映一塲、不敷開支、勢將被迫停閉、</p>

<h3>天明綢廠小主　劉慶一昨被綁　早晨赴廠辦公連車被擄　事前曾接得匪方嚇詐信</h3>
<p>昨晨八時三刻許、滬西延平路康腦脫路附近、突發生綁架案一起、被綁者爲星加坡路五十三號天明綢廠小主浙江吳興人劉慶一、現年二十八歲、其父劉仲康、（五十九歲）在星加坡路五十三號開設天明綢廠、另設發行所於厦門路尊穗里五十一號、其父子則同住康腦脫路康邨三十九號、劉慶一亦</p>
<p>任職該廠</p>
<p>每晨出外時、必先至星加坡路廠中、巡視一週、然後赴發行所辦公、昨晨八時半、劉起身後、早餐畢、穿中將藏靑綢長衫、循例乘九五七五號汽車、由料車經離寓所不遠之延平路康腦脫路口之際、突有綁匪三人、兩穿西裝、一穿短衣、自旁竄出、同時有人力車兩輛、先將劉車攔住、阻止前進、然後三綁匪</p>
<p>各出手槍威逼劉車司機人、撥動引擎、跟隨匪方預停路旁黑牌照會二〇三〇號汽車前進、迨匪車駛至憶定盤路開納路附近、忽然停止、由一匪將劉之司機逐下、然後自行駕駛、連車及劉綁架無蹤、司機魏國峰遂回家據情報告、乃由劉家轉投靜安寺捕房報告、請求查緝、但至晚尚無下落、即劉之汽車亦未發現、事後記者探悉、劉慶一於事先曾接匪方</p>
<p>投函勒索三萬元、劉當時旣未派人接洽、又未報告捕房、以本人並無多資、故一笑置之、不料時隔未久、竟遭綁架、現正由捕房飭屬一體營救中、又據新聲社云、劉爲天明廠之普通職員、家非富有、且乘坐之汽車爲廠裹公用車、亦非自己所備、此决遭匪垂涎綁去、實出意料之外、</p>

<h3>歷史的研究法（一）</h3>
<p>— 薛無競</p>
<p>世界上開化最早的國家、一曰埃及、一曰印度、一曰巴比倫、一曰中國、中國自黃帝以來、即有史官、雖則三墳五典、八索儿丘、晋之乘、楚之　杌、以及百國春秋、經秦火之後、都不流傳、然而史料之豐富、文物之紀載、汗牛充棟、卷貢造繁、舉世都無其匹、實在値得吾人自豪、可是最著名的、一部司馬光資治通鑑、只供帝王閱覽之用、因而誇張戰爭的事實多描寫文化的演進少、注重朝代的變遷、而略於社會的沿革、侈陳聖賢的敎訓、而忘却平民的貢獻，以例他史、可以類推進、無怪大史家韋爾斯說、「距今二百年前、世界未有一著述足稱爲史者、」這不是說無史、乃是說古今編史的人、觀念不同、所以從前的書籍、未必適合現代人的閱覽、而現代治史的方法、也與從前大異其趣、所以讀歷史、就有研究的必要了、我個人並非治史的專家、不過幼年、即　披覽、長而濫孚敎席、就平日所知、略述一二、以供芻　之見、</p>
<p>（一）什麼叫歷史</p>
<p>說文「史、記事者也、　又持中、中正也、」中正無形、何能手持、吳大澂云、「史象手執簡形、」然中與簡形、亦頗不類、江永以爲「又者右手，以手持諱書也、」義已較明、王國維云、「中者盛筴之器……史字　又持中、義爲持書之人……持　爲史事者、正由持莢爲史事故也、古者書筴皆史掌之……」由此看來、史是持簡策記事之意、此說最愜人意、所謂歷史者、據魯濱生新史學云、「歷史是一種研究人類過去事業廣泛的學問、」此言似乎過於泛濫、我以爲他的定義是——</p>
<p>歷史者、研究人類之進化、社會之發達、與凡百事物之變遷代替之現象者也、</p>
<p>右述進化二字、絕非泛泛、試以史事證之、人類生活、由漁獵而遊收、而農業、而工商業、人類用具、由石器而銅器、而鐵器、而電氣、以言組織山個人而部落、而國家、而世界大同、以言政治、由神權而君權、而民權、無一不有進化之跡、這可知勝史、不是一人一姓的家譜與世系了、</p>

<h3>施放人造霧</h3>
<p>— 潘禮</p>
<p>據說在此决德蘇的戰爭中，穗方已經施放過人造霧。人造霧的作用，也可說是戰塲上的一種神經戰，除了掩護本方部隊的前進以外，使對方的軍隊如墮入五里霧中，咫尺之外，就分辨不淸自己的面目，迷失方向，發生恐慌，於是鬥氣全失。</p>
<p>德方施放人造霧，結果不知如何，報上還沒有詳細的記載。然而我們祗要看看近年來的事實，就可以知道希特勒是慣於施放人造霧的了。</p>
<p>此决穗蘇作戰，外國的新聞記者，都沒法子到前方去採訪消息，戰訊全靠雙方的官方機關發出。我炸燬你的飛機幾千架，你破壞我的坦克車幾百輛，看起來令人將信將疑，猶如墮入五里霧中，祗好在這五里霧中猜測戰事發展的情形了。</p>
<p>兩年前德蘇的突締互不侵犯條的，果然出乎世人的意料之外，這决德軍攻蘇，更是使世人摸不着頭腦。據報上說，連穗國人民也莫不「瞠目結舌」。這也可見希特勒的善於施放『人造霧』了。</p>
<p>在戰塲上對敵軍施放人造霧，也　是巧妙的舉動，可是如果到處要施放人造霧，甚至使自國的民衆，也如墮入黑霧中，抹煞人民的意旨，總不會有好結果的。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>血的慷槪</h3>
<p>— 菲子</p>
<p>B字病房新來了一位病人。</p>
<p>經過X光的診斷後，發現她的胃腸接合處已經破裂，於是，她的病狀正式成立——胃瘍。</p>
<p>這是必須施行手術的。</p>
<p>第一步，我們就停止她的飲食，使胃子騰空了，而以葡萄糖維持她的營養。</p>
<p>她的險色，發白地像紙一般。</p>
<p>『要是沒有血的供應，怎能施行手術呢？」</p>
<p>不止劉大去在發愁，誰不一皺同情之眉？</p>
<p>她的家族方面，盡了最大的努力，在一個極高代價的條件下，纔邀到兩位苦力階級答允『嘗試』。</p>
<p>照例，我們得先化騐他們的血型，密斯穆拿着針頭剛戳入這一位的指頭上，他『啊喲』一聲，另一位就急速溜了。結果，血還沒有抽出半CC，他已要求『免試』了！</p>
<p>我們　這滑稽的一幕，只有作一個苦笑。</p>
<p>同時，躺在床上的病者，她似乎相當的『人道』，她堅持不願做『殘忍的事』—將別人的血來維持自己的生命。</p>
<p>我們更只有苦笑了。</p>
<p>「血！別把牠看作這麼「寳貝」！反之，她的寳貴在「捨」的原則下纔顯出。</p>
<p>「生物的組織，都是新陳代謝的。「血的吝嗇」，並不會加增你什麼。一個身體健全的人，一次可以輸出五百CC的血而不會有任何反應！至多，兩三天的休息，就恢復了原有的血量，或竟超過原有的。</p>
<p>「在歐美，有「輸血大王」，有「儲血所」，誰都把輸血看作極榮譽的事。以人類互助的立塲來說，血的供應是最偉大不過的！</p>
<p>「翻過來，我們接受他人之血，儘可以「處之泰然」，一點沒有殘忍，也一點沒有違背人道！反之，讓息己生命白白送掉的，纔是殘忍，纔是不人道！』</p>
<p>劉大夫的一段話，釋放了床上的病者，和圍着這床沿的一羣！</p>
<p>終於，她的同學—三位時代的小姐，同時奮勇地請求騐血了！劉大夫的語，得了收獲了！</p>
<p>萬幸！她們的血同是屬乎A型的，與病者一樣。</p>
<p>我們檢查她們的體格，允其是心臟部份，什麼都沒問題！我們纔放膽地輸血了。</p>
<p>經過三决（分三天輸給）的輸血後，病者的臉陡的躍起來，她由像灰色的秋雲，回到春的朝霞來！病房內起了騷動，每一道目光都集中在這白色的床，—是呀，她還是一個多美麗的女子呀！</p>
<p>手術也施行了，很順利地過去。</p>
<p>兩個月後，她像小鳥般地飛出了這個醫院。</p>
<p>她回我們道謝，同時她留下她的地址，並鄭重地說：</p>
<p>「等有什麼病人需要血的，我可以慷慨的輸給。』</p>
<p>誠懇地，情願地！</p>
<p>這一决的收獲，是我們一個新的紀錄。</p>
<p>可不是，在更生的新中國裹，正需要更多像這樣的人來實行血的「慷慨』！</p>
<p>沒有一個偉大的『慷慨』是超過這個的！</p>
<h3>食</h3>
<p>— 陳琪作</p>
<h3>甘必達</h3>
<p>— 侯放</p>
<p>拿破崙的鐵騎踏遍了普魯士。哲學敎授斐希特目擊心傷，到處宣傳，振起了普魯士人民的道德，接着俾斯麥把普魯士統一了，變成今日的德意志。</p>
<p>俾斯麥於普法戰爭時，幾天之內把巴黎圍住，法國志士甘必達對羣衆演說：『法蘭西之民乎！毌忘此日』，完了乘汽球走了，結果第一决歐戰法國報了仇。</p>
<p>現在第二决世界大戰了，德國是吾是雪了第一次大戰的仇呢？難道第三第四决……</p>
<p>我希望中國多些甘必達和斐希特等人。</p>
<h3>健康的話</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>健康是美滿的人生所不可缺少的基石。家庭中的一切快樂，事業上的成功，都是建　在身體的健全和活力上。</p>
<p>健康是必需從生命的活動和身體的操練得着快樂。同時也需要有不斷的精力，來担負艱巨的工作；唯有從活動的游戲和勤勞的工作，能令無論何人都能得着永久滿足的人生。——Charles　W.Eliot</p>
<h3>健談</h3>
<p>— 明葦</p>
<p>生命的長短不是由他所活的年數來計算，而是由他在這多少年中所遭遇的事來計算的。H.Ashton　Wlofe</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十　慈父的心</p>
<p>這一次，秋海棠是眞正的從心底衷快活起來了！快活得竟使他在笑的時候，也掉下了眼淚來，從十年前他在天津受了季兆雄的暗算之後，今天還是他第一决自動的笑出來咧！</p>
<p>但因爲老師這麼一讚，那第一個發現秋海棠的女學生，便不覺又倒過臉來，向窗外看着，引得好幾個學生都跟着她這樣做。</p>
<p>「這就是吳梅影的老子啊！怎麼又窮，又醜，像個妖怪一樣？」他彷彿在幻覺上聽到裏面那些學生在這樣說，臉上不覺一陣羞窘，忙來不及的從走廊裏跳到了操塲上去；可是他又捨不得走得太遠，大的距離三四尺路便站住了。</p>
<p>大雨還是不停的在下着，打濕了他的頭髮，打濕了他的外衣，但他一些也不覺得，雨傘挾在腰間，也想不到把它打開來。</p>
<p>「……所以她每次總考第一……。」先生的聲音，彷彿還在他耳朶邊影着。</p>
<p>這倒是眞的！梅寳自從在七歲那一年被他送進這一所小學校來以後，每學期總是考的第一名，而且從不缺課，品行也好；一張張印刷極不講究的獎狀，幾乎把秋海棠臥室裹的一方墻壁也貼滿了；使他在極度憂鬱困苦的處境中，多少還能得到一些安慰。</p>
<p>「下半年決定送她上中學堂去！」他心裏一再如此盤算着。</p>
<p>「噲！你老人家可是瘋啦？站在大雨裹，爲什麼不撑傘啊？」那校工叉從裏面退出來了，一瞧見他便這樣喊。「快些，走進廊下來吧！散課還有二十分鐘咧」</p>
<p>聽他這麼一喊，秋海棠才開始覺得自己的衣服已經完全濕透了。（一五〇）</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3>坦克偵察車</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>此次歐戰中，德國方面拿出了不少新武器來，其中的一種，就是鋼甲斥堠車，車上造有堅固的無綫電空架，旣能抵禦敵軍砲火的損害，父能撇去當　的障礙物。此種卓輛屬於德國的坦克師團所有，用以偵察敵方陣地，軍隊的集中，以及迫擊砲的砲位，並隨時把各種消息傳達給後面尾隨的坦克　。可以稱爲坦克偵察車。在最近德軍侵蘇的戰爭中，這種坦克偵察卑無疑　又在前綫活躍了。</p>

<h3>藝人為貧兒造福</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>這是一個喜訊：——「影星」隊要出戰「猛獅」了，日期已定七月六日和七月十三日二天，地點在上海貧兒敎養院的塲地。他們把賣座收入，除去一部份必須的開支以外，其他悉數充作該院的基金，培育貧兒，造福國家，這點是很值得我們推重的。</p>
<p>「影星」隊的領導者是張善琨，陳容有：殷秀岑守門，張慧冲右衛，劉瓊左衛，吳永剛中堅，王引中鋒，以及韓蘭根的右翼和岳楓的左翼。據張慧冲談：全隊隊員，莫不興奮之至，「肥猪」與「瘦猴」，將各有驚人表演，屆時並請大批電影明星，組織「拉拉隊」到塲助威。</p>
<p>「猛獅」的陳綫，也非常堅强，該隊領導者是丁度，有熊傑守門，潘嗚海右衛，唐根福左衛，唐佐文中堅，錢祖滋中鋒，王湖生右翼，潘新左翼。</p>
<p>所以這一次的比賽，預料情况必甚熱烈，將見全市球迷，影迷，一致動員矣。</p>
<p>最後我們還可以為讀者報道一個消息，就是貧兒院的院長郭守純，以及陳林森，張慧冲，韓蘭根等熱血同志，將要發動一次影劇人的聯合演出，譬如在正氣歌中飾文天祥的石揮，風波亭中飾岳飛的黃河，明末遺恨中飾葛嫩娘的唐若靑，恩與仇中飾周福祥的仇銓，英烈傳中飾劉伯溫的韓非，家中飾嗚鳳的英子，以及電影界如周起，王引，梅熹，孫敏，王獻齊，藍蘭，慕容婉兒等，均義不容辭，一致參加。</p>
<p>這一個陳容在兌現時，自然會轟動一時的，因為他們過是話劇界，電影界的優秀演員，從來沒有一起配過戲，一起上過舞臺，將來與大學見面，各顯藝術，各展演技，當有一番盛况也。</p>
<p>該院現有學生二百八十餘人，以前他們是從來不向外方募捐的，現在因為遭受生活高漲的影響，不得不請求各界幫助了。</p>
<p>我們希望站在藝術陳綫上的同志們，在此時此地這樣惡劣的環境裏，雖不能直接為國家效勞，也應該間接替國家盡力，譬如推行善舉，培育貧兒，集體獻金，這都是每個人的工作，每個人崗位上的工作。</p>
<p>我們相信今日的兒童，即是未來國家的主人翁。</p>
<h3>胡蓉的厄運</h3>
<p>— 天聲</p>
<p>為安息日請假突受停學處分</p>
<p>著名童星胡蓉蓉，自告息隱後，即一心向學，努力攻讀，自今轉入「進德女中附小」，業已完成六年小學學程，下學期即將升入初中肄業。但近忽聞胡蓉蓉因遵守「安息日」請假事，突被該校敎務處予以「變相」之停學處分，茲經探得其眞相：按蓉蓉家庭之篤信基督敎，影圈內外人士無不知之，我國銀壇藝人，信崇基督敎者，固不僅胡氏一家，此外如紅星陳　裳，亦係宗敎家庭，胡蝶黎明暉二人，於洞房花燭之前，均依順乾宅之信仰，先得受洗入敎，然後方得賦夫唱婦隨之兒。惟以上數家均不若胡蓉蓉家庭信奉之虔誠。該校敎務處，即以蓉蓉姊弟三人，因守「安息日」關係，每逢星期六請假半天事，借有礙校規為由，宣傳下學期起將謝絕胡蓉蓉姊弟之繼續升學，並拒收留座費與拒發轉學證書，但表示如肯改變守安息日之規矩，則允許以升學云。蓉蓉家長獲訊後，不勝驚異，以此缺課乃因信仰關係並經家長請假，絕非學生無故曠課可比，故不涉及校規，乃一度向學校當局請求收回成命，惜未獲允許。現聞其家長仍在作二次請求，務冀校方「恩開一面」，仍照前例，勿生異議，結果如何，尙未得知。</p>
<p>據蓉蓉姊北前在光夏中小學肄業時，關於安息日請假事，亦獲准許，蓋因信仰自由，乃國家法律所賦予人民之特權，自宜尊重。同時胡蓉蓉姊北歷屆考試，皆常列第一，較一般學生之成績，反為優良，故守安息日一事，並不妨礙學業也。</p>

<p>他的母親年過九十，拍案大笑道：「幸哉吾門，父死為忠，子死為孝，妻死為節，母死為義」，所以亦自刎而亡。忠孝節義，出於一門，至今赫赫丹書，永垂不朽。我們倘能效學卞壺的一家，不是很好的嗎？你又何必戀戀於我呢？否則就是不忠不孝之人，有何面目見祖先於地下？周遇吉聽了他母親之言，不由熱淚奪眶而出，又向他母親拜倒道：「母親金玉良言，諄諄賜誨，我敢不捨死忘生，以報國家呢？」劉氏和他的兒子也在旁邊拭淚。周遇吉別了父母妻子，又到衙署中坐定。王衛國上前參見。周遇吉遂出示曉諭百姓，有壯丁的都要出來相助守關，其餘老弱婦女儘可離此他避。又點查關中糧食軍械，忙碌了半天。傍晚時候，忽報李自成有使者求見。周遇吉傳喚人，見使者送上一封書信幷禮物數事。周遇吉拆閱之下，勃然大怒。原來是李自成愛惜周遇吉的將才，特地修書來此勸降，以良禽擇木而棲，賢臣擇主而事等語婉言勸導，幷誘以爵祿，恫以兵威。周遇吉拍案大罵道：「李賊弄兵潢池，擾亂中原，早晚必受天誅。我周遇吉是個奇男子，偉丈夫。自古有斷頭將軍，無降將軍，豈肯降心為賊？快敎他來吃我一槍。」說罷，將那封書信撕得粉碎，喝令左右把使者割去兩耳，逐他出城。使者耳朶被割，狼狽回去。周遇吉又傳見許靖張烈等訓話，對他們說道：李自成此次大舉來攻，早已注意於我了。在代州時遺刺客來行刺不成，今番又差使者下書觀降，我已撕去盡信，幷割使者兩耳，逐他回去，當然更是激怒了那厮，說不定日內即要來此猛攻。我已誓死報國，臨難不苟，寗武有失，我也不能再活了。與城俱存，與城俱亡，望諸位助我一同　力殺賊，斷不讓張巡許遠專美於先，許靖王衛國等都願遵從軍令，有進無退。　（一〇七）</p>

<h3>Guo Taiqi Broadcasts to London on China and the World Situation: China's Severance of Relations with Germany and Italy Clarifies the International Situation; The Far Eastern Question Must Be Resolved Simultaneously with World Problems</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi broadcast to London this morning, saying that since departing from London two months ago, he has been thinking of you all. He arrived here safely a week ago amidst the bombing season and scorching heat. You may wish to hear a comparison between life in Chongqing and London. There is more hardship and more bloodshed here. When I met with my friend, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the other afternoon, we were both busy taking off our coats, but still sweating profusely. I must state that I greatly admire Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's spirit of remaining here to work despite the repeated bombing of the embassy by Japanese planes. I myself am afraid that I have become accustomed to the pleasant summer climate of England and methods of adjustment over the past nine years, such as starting work at 6:30 in the morning. There is indeed hardship and bloodshed here, and some tears, but the people are still carrying on with everything very cheerfully. I am greatly moved by the good spirit I have seen in Chongqing. Our air defenses are very weak compared to London. Japanese planes can bomb us more or less at will, but there is one feature that seems more advantageous compared to London, which is that we have solid and safe air-raid shelters. The day after I took office, I was forced by the situation to take swift action and sever diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. This action has further clarified the international situation. Now the whole world is rapidly splitting into two opposing groups, namely the Axis powers and the anti-aggression group. This development has further strengthened my personal belief that China's destiny is closely linked to that of the democratic countries. The solution to the Far Eastern question is impossible until there is a general solution for the whole world, because it must form a part of the world solution. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London - Upon hearing rumors that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had threatened to execute anyone who advocated peace with Japan, the new Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom smiled and said, "Regardless of whether this statement is true or not, it can represent the people's determination to fight to the end. The war has been long and the suffering has been deep, but no Chinese, whether in or out of government, advocates compromise with Japan, especially at a time when the world situation is gradually becoming more favorable to China." Ambassador Gu expressed surprise at London's calm and orderly appearance, saying that everything seemed normal, with arrangements complete, supplies ample, public services running as usual, and residents showing no signs of alarm or inconvenience, which was completely different from the impressions he had from reading news of air raids abroad. What made him feel particularly concerned was that compared to London, the people of Vichy were unsettled, lacking supplies, and full of anxiety and worry. He believed that Vichy would not necessarily follow in the footsteps of other countries under German direction and recognize the Nanjing regime unless it was pressured by Germany. Marshal Pétain's position was extremely difficult, and people should sympathize with him. Ambassador Gu's wife is currently residing in Vichy temporarily. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - After Germany and Italy recognized the Nanjing regime, China immediately severed diplomatic relations with them. Observers of Far Eastern events here were not surprised. China's consistent resistance to aggression is well known here. Germany and Italy's recognition of the Nanjing regime left Chongqing with no other choice but to sever relations, as it recognized that Germany and Italy were colluding with Japan to overthrow the government that had been striving for independence for four years and had placed the strongest nation in the East in a difficult situation, while it was continuously recognized by foreigners. The United States is currently carefully watching Japan's continued difficulties. Time and circumstances often present Japan with diplomatic and military opportunities, but internal disputes and disagreements over goals and procedures have eroded time and caused opportunities to pass. Regarding information on the decisions made at the Imperial Conference, the United States is eagerly awaiting it. However, judging from what Moscow has reported, the Soviet Union has learned of the content of Japan's policies, and it seems that Japan has no intention of launching an immediate attack on the Soviet Union for the benefit of Germany or itself. People here believe that Foreign Minister Matsuoka's statement after the Imperial Conference that East Asia is currently encountering a serious situation directly related to Japan is indeed consistent with the facts.

<h3>China's Financial Foundation is Solid</h3>

However, the financial foundation is extremely solid. The purpose of convening the three financial conferences was to thoroughly implement the central government's established financial and economic policies. Many proposals were discussed in detail, and practical methods will be implemented with reference to the actual situation of each province and current needs. The future of China's finances is quite optimistic. Yu expressed admiration for the perseverance of the people of the capital and said that the daily Japanese air raids on Chongqing have never shaken the people's belief in resistance and reconstruction.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From Summer Health Preservation to Immunity</h3>
<p>True seasonal cholera has recently been discovered. Although it has also been transmitted from other places, the existence of this disease in the local area means that there are bacteria present, and it is difficult to guarantee that it will not breed and spread, causing harm to the population. Moreover, the cholera season has just begun. Without proper prevention and treatment, it is feared that the narrow living spaces and dense population of Shanghai will cause the disease to spread like wildfire. Other diseases such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, and tuberculosis are also more prevalent than before the war. Given this situation, the public health of Shanghai is truly worrying. Fortunately, the local authorities are doing their best, and public-spirited individuals and public organizations are helping each other to prevent epidemics. This is why Shanghai has not experienced a major epidemic after the war.</p>
<p>However, to investigate the root cause of the disease: the crowding of people in one corner, the teeming households in small rooms, and the pollution of the air are conducive to the spread of disease and harmful to health, firstly. The endless rise in prices means that income is often insufficient to cover expenses. Therefore, a frugal and simple diet is the natural result, and insufficient nutrition makes it easy for disease demons to invade, secondly. Those who enjoy affluent lives often indulge in immoderate eating and drinking, irregular living habits, and a romantic lifestyle, which damage their vitality and lead to disease, thirdly. Many people live in hardship, suffering from hunger and cold, and spend their days worrying and unable to find a solution. Because of depression and physical weakness, they develop tuberculosis, fourthly. All of these are caused by living problems; affluence leads to dissipation and extravagance, resulting in disease that is self-inflicted; poverty leads to helplessness and illness that is not entirely man-made. Is this not fate?</p>
<p>Diseases caused by living problems cannot be cured by the best methods, because only by improving living conditions and restoring the original state can these diseases be eliminated. What can be said at present is only a temporary solution, such as continuing the anti-epidemic campaign as usual and preparing for more epidemic prevention equipment. In addition, habits such as cautious living and moderate eating, which are more fundamental in nature, should be followed. Although these two are close to common talk, it is precisely because they are common that they are easily overlooked, without realizing that they are the great principles of health preservation. Regular living and moderate eating are the rules of life. However, urban life is prone to being abnormal, making night into day as a matter of course. Every summer, escaping the heat is easy to lead to a night life. Those with strong bodies may be fine for a while, but the weak are prone to illness. If you think that a leisurely life allows you to do whatever you want, without realizing that even the emperors of autocratic times were the most supreme and enjoyed the most, from the time of the Qin Dynasty, there were a total of 183 people who established dynasties and claimed to be emperors. Among them, 16 are not known to have lived long, but 69 died between the ages of 20 and 40, accounting for more than 40 percent. In general, founders of dynasties and capable rulers tend to live long, while mediocre rulers of later generations tend to die young. The Yuan Dynasty was a strong Mongolian tribe, but other than Kublai Khan, who lived to the age of 80, the average age of the other emperors was only 30. Ming Taizu lived to the age of 71, but the average age of the emperors after him was only 43. The Qing Dynasty, from Kangxi to Daoguang, all lived to old age, while the Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu periods were all short-lived. Even with the life of an emperor, at a minimum, he should be able to live out his natural lifespan, but the facts are not so. How can we not say that this is due to indulging in desires and irregular living and eating habits? Urban wealthy families enjoy extreme enjoyment, no different from emperors. Considering the above, we should know that indulgence leads to death, and extravagance is useless, and realize the way to strive for strength.</p>
<p>During the summer, people naturally like to eat cold food. However, the harm of seeking momentary pleasure is unspeakable. The prevalence of typhoid fever and abdominal diseases means that bacteria can easily enter from cold food. Therefore, while floating melons and submerged plums, snow lotus root, and ice cream can cool you down, how can they compare to cooked food and boiling drinks, waiting quietly for them to cool down, which can kill bacteria? It is important to know that the human body temperature does not fluctuate much with the air temperature. When the air temperature is close to the body temperature, people often complain of great heat. If it is higher than the body temperature, then an air temperature close to 100 degrees Fahrenheit is rare. However, people use stoves in winter and drink ice in summer, changing with the climate, regardless of the cold and heat that stimulate the stomach and intestines. It can be known that this is not in accordance with hygiene.</p>
<p>I believe that the best prevention of epidemics is hygiene. The summer this year is longer, and diseases have already occurred before the summer, so we should pay close attention to the issue of health preservation in the future. Protecting one's own health is protecting the health of the public. Preventing disease in one's own family is hoping for immunity in the entire society. Therefore, we should pay close attention to our living and eating habits.</p>
<h3>Examination Yuan to Hold Regular Special Examination for Judicial Officials; Examination to Be Held Simultaneously in Chengdu, Kunming, and Other Places; Those Who Pass the Re-examination Will Have the Opportunity to Fill Vacancies</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Examination Yuan has announced that the special examination for judicial officials will be held simultaneously in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xingguo, Yong'an, Songyang, and Lushi, starting on August 16th of this year. In recent years, the examination for judges has been held jointly with the examination for administrative personnel, and few have been admitted. The judicial authorities plan to establish courts throughout the country in phases over the years, and there is a great need for talent. Therefore, they specially requested the Examination Yuan to hold a special examination, with a quota of 500 people. Since the unification of judicial funding, the salaries of judges in each province are completely the same as those of central government employees, and the candidate judges will be changed to real positions next year. Those who pass the examination this time will have the opportunity to fill vacancies after passing the re-examination, without having to wait for a vacancy, and the number of vacancies is very large, making it easier to be admitted. It is expected that those who aspire to serve in the judicial field will be eager to take the examination. (4th)</p>
<h3>Wang Yang and Others Voluntarily Declare Inheritance Tax</h3>

<h3>Vichy Side Confirms Fall of Palmyra, British Forces Continue to Advance Towards Homs, Syrian War May End Soon</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 4th - The Allied forces' occupation of Palmyra is of great significance for ending the Syrian war. The road to Homs has now been opened. If Homs is captured by the Allied forces, the Vichy forces will be cut in two. Although the Vichy forces defended Palmyra for ten days, resistance throughout Syria is showing signs of weakening. The continuous bombing by the British and Australian air forces has been instrumental in forcing Palmyra to surrender.</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 4th - As the Allied forces in Syria gradually surrounded Palmyra, cutting off the Vichy forces' retreat to Homs, they finally captured this important city in the desert after thirteen days. Palmyra is located 150 miles northeast of Damascus, where a French oil pipeline passes through central Syria. It was recently used by the Axis powers as an air force base. Officials here announced that the Vichy forces stationed in Palmyra surrendered on Thursday afternoon. Vichy High Commissioner for Syria, General Dentz, said that the city fell after a "fierce attack by British armored forces." A Vichy communiqué also stated that a British motorized force entered Syria from Iraq on Thursday and is advancing on the Mosul-Aleppo road, while another British motorized force, starting from the border, is fighting the Vichy forces 102 miles northeast of Palmyra. British and Australian aircraft are providing support, heavily attacking key enemy positions and bombing military targets such as ships and airfields in the port of Beirut. At the same time, the Allied forces on the southern front in Syria continue to make progress. It is reported that a large number of Vichy soldiers have been captured and have joined the Free French forces. It is expected that more will join the Free French forces in the future. The Vichy communiqué regarding the fall of Palmyra stated, "On Thursday morning, a column of British motorized forces entered Syria from Iraq, attempting to advance along the Mosul railway. The British are also intensifying their efforts in the Syrian desert and bombing the city of Beirut. Reinforced British artillery first bombarded our positions in Palmyra, and then launched a fierce attack with armored vehicles, finally capturing Palmyra on July 3rd. The defenders of the city resisted an enemy superior in manpower and resources for thirteen days, which is admirable. Our forces southeast of Deir ez-Zor, on the right bank of the Euphrates River, are currently resisting a British motorized force advancing from Abu Kamal. In the north, a column of British motorized forces entered Syria from Iraq this morning at Deirko Kirk, attempting to advance along the Mosul railway. In the mountainous area of southern Lebanon, both armies are active with patrols and artillery fire. Along the coast, the British fleet is shelling our positions in Damour. Our air force continues to bomb enemy forces in the Palmyra and Abu Kamal areas. On July 1st, our fighters shot down two British aircraft and severely damaged one. On Wednesday night, the city of Beirut was subjected to even more intense bombing by the British air force, and several non-military areas were also bombed, causing significant damage and civilian casualties."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The Vichy government has protested to Britain about the bombing of Beirut. The Vichy news agency stated that the French ambassador to Spain, Pietri, has delivered a protest note to the British ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare.</p>

<h3>German Forces Launch Three-Pronged Offensive Approaching Stalin Line, Red Army Fights Valiantly, Main Battle Begins, Heavy Snowstorms in Poland Hinder German Advance</h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 4th - Last night's communiqué stated that Soviet troops inflicted heavy blows on German forces during the fierce fighting along the Berezina River yesterday, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. The Berezina River is located 360 miles west of Moscow, the site of Napoleon's army's defeat over 300 years ago.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th - The entire Soviet front has retreated, and German forces are pursuing and have approached the Stalin Line. In some places, the vanguard has gone beyond where the Axis forces reached in 1918.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 4th - German headquarters announced yesterday that Soviet troops are retreating in a panic along the entire 1,500-mile front, with German land and air forces pursuing and striking with a barrage of fire. However, there is no news on how far the three-pronged offensive, from the Baltic states towards Leningrad, from Minsk towards Moscow, and from Ukraine towards Kiev, has progressed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - As German forces penetrate deep into various regions of the Soviet western frontier, an unprecedented war is about to begin. The main Soviet forces, possessing a large number of tanks and aircraft, appear to have joined the action. The Soviet side said that there was fierce fighting along the line last night, with the most intense battles occurring near Tver, Rovno, Ternopol, and Bobruisk, inflicting heavy damage on the German forces. The German side said that they are pursuing the Soviet army along the entire line, inflicting heavy losses. The German side also claimed progress in the Berezina River area of ​​Belarus. South of the Pripyat Marshes, German armored vehicle vanguards are now advancing towards Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. Little news is available about the large Soviet forces in the Baltic and central regions that were surrounded and almost cut off, except for the German propaganda that 100,000 people have been captured. The Soviets acknowledged continued victories in the Baltic states. As the German army advanced north towards Leningrad, it forcibly crossed the Daugava River in Latvia. According to German claims, they have now reached the northern border of Latvia. It is reported that the German army plans to cross the river in three different directions, but it must be reinforced before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th - A German official news agency reported last night that severe weather and heavy snowstorms around Lviv are now hindering the operations of Nazi forces in southeastern Poland, while Soviet forces are putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - It is reported that the strong resistance of the Soviet army and the weather conditions have slowed the German blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union. Moscow recently admitted that the German army has mobilized fresh troops and forcibly crossed the Daugava River after fierce battles near Jēkabpils (in Latvia) and Tver (in Lithuania). General attention is now focused on the outskirts of Ukraine, where German forces still seem to be in the vicinity of the western outskirts of Ukraine, approaching the Soviet army in three directions. The latest Soviet communiqué stated that German forces are currently attacking along an 85-mile line south of Cziko (a place in southern Poland). One German force is probing east of Denmark (30 miles on the road to Kiev in Ukraine), and another appears to be planning to attack further south. A press report from Kiev reported that German and Romanian troops, departing from Moldova and crossing the Prut River, have launched a pincer movement in the past 48 hours, intending to encircle Soviet troops. A recent German communiqué stated that German forces have crossed the Prut River in the northern outskirts of Romania and are now advancing towards the second line of Soviet defense on the Dnieper River. The exact direction of the German offensive in this area is currently unclear. Moscow has not mentioned this. However, military experts in London say that this German offensive may pose a new threat to Kiev from the south, as the Soviet supply line is in western Ukraine. The German communiqué did not mention the Minsk area. The Soviet side only said that the Axis forces' attempt to cross the Berezina River near Borisov had failed, but did not mention the Soviet forces west of Minsk that were said to be isolated and being surrounded by the German side. The German communiqué also stated that Soviet troops were retreating along the entire line, while the German news agency reported that Soviet troops in southeastern Poland were resisting strongly, and the Axis forces' advance was now hindered by snowstorms.</p>
<p>The Soviet side issued a communiqué at 9:00 am this morning stating that there were fierce battles in the northern and central sectors of the Soviet-German war on Thursday. In the Tver area, there were fierce battles along the Daugava River. The battles in the Jēkabpils and Tver areas were very fierce. After the enemy mobilized fresh troops and launched a fierce attack, they were able to forcibly cross the Daugava River near Jēkabpils and Tver, and bloody battles resumed. In the Minsk area, our army resolutely resisted the enemy, inflicting heavy losses. After our army engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the enemy was defeated. There was also fierce fighting on the Berezina River, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. It has now been confirmed that enemy tanks avoid engaging our heavy and medium tanks, and when our fighters arrive at the battlefield, they immediately seize air supremacy. Our air force launched a fierce attack all day on enemy mechanized units crossing the Daugava River and in the areas of Bobruisk (southeast of Minsk) and Ternopol (southeastern Poland).</p>
<p>Soviet-German War Report</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th - The Soviet Union issued the following war report last night: 1. In the areas of Tver, Minsk, and Ternopol, our army fiercely engaged the enemy's large motorized and mechanized units. The enemy encountered our strong resistance in every direction, and was subjected to heavy blows by our air force and artillery. Tens of thousands of Axis corpses were scattered everywhere. Enemy aircraft and enemy tanks were destroyed everywhere and were burning. 3. A major battle broke out along the Chapunaye-Daugava River in the Tver area on the 3rd. The war in the Jēkabpils and Tver areas was very fierce. The enemy repeatedly reinforced, forcibly crossing the Chapunaye-Daugava River and arriving on the north bank of the river near Jēkabpils and Tver. The major battle there resumed. In the Minsk area, after our army's fierce resistance, the enemy suffered heavy losses. The enemy could not resist our offensive. There was also fierce fighting on the Berezina River all day. Our land and air forces inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. Various facts prove that enemy tanks avoid engaging our tanks. Yesterday, all day, our air force inflicted heavy losses on enemy mechanized units crossing the Chapunaye-Daugava River and in the areas of Bobruisk and Ternopol. Detailed figures are being estimated.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 4th - The High Command announced today that German forces advancing on Moscow have crossed the Berezina River in several places. North of the Berezina, German forces have reached the border between the Soviet Union and Latvia. The German air force is constantly launching attacks deep into the interior against retreating Soviet troops, causing heavy casualties, as they are pursued by German forces and the roads are difficult to travel. The communiqué also stated that German forces have obtained maps and documents from the Soviet General Staff. The maps and documents have revealed the Red Army's aggressive intentions and revealed that the Soviets are building new airfields in Bessarabia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The communiqué also stated that the number of Soviet aircraft lost on the ground is 25 to 50 percent higher than originally announced.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - An Axis official news agency stated: (1) A German unit that destroyed 40 Soviet tanks on Wednesday was operating in Dubno and destroyed 30 Soviet tanks.

<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th - It is reliably stated here today that in the Bialystok battlefield, the number of Soviet troops abandoned and killed is no less than hundreds of thousands. This is because the Soviet army launched a group attack, and suffered this heavy blow. The Soviet command ignored this heavy sacrifice and repeatedly ordered attacks on German positions. German weapons fired intensively, killing hundreds of thousands of enemies.</p>

As for the Baltic coast, the German army is advancing from Riga towards Pskov in order to make contact with the German army advancing from Tver. In addition, another German army is currently advancing rapidly towards Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.

<p>Reuters, Madrid, 4th - Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer told a German reporter that Spain's position on the German-Soviet war is to stand on the side of its friends as the most resolute spiritual belligerent state to resist the enemy that Spain hates the most, and there is no other way. In terms of volunteers, the presence on the battlefield will make the spiritual belligerent status complete. Spain's contribution to the war for Western civilization will not be limited to what current circumstances allow. Suñer continued, "I believe that the Axis victory over the Soviet Union will bring the world towards peace. At that time, the United States will know that its participation in the war is not only useless, but will prolong the tragedy of human sacrifice, and Britain will also understand and accept peace as the only way to preserve itself."</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union at a Critical Juncture; Resolves on Scorched Earth Warfare; Urges the People to Rise Up and Strive for Victory; Full Text of Stalin's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 4th. Stalin, Chairman of the State Defense Committee of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech on radio on July 3rd. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Comrades, citizens, brothers and sisters, officers and men of the army and navy, I am now broadcasting to you. The treacherous attack by Hitlerite Germany on our motherland began on June 22nd and is continuing. Although our Red Army is resisting bravely and the enemy's superior air force and elite land forces have been destroyed and met their doom on the battlefield, the enemy is still sending reinforcements to continue its advance. Hitler's troops have already occupied parts of Lithuania, Latvia, western Belarus, and western Ukraine. The fascist air force has also expanded its bombing range, fiercely bombing Murmansk, Orsha, Mogilev, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, and Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Our country is now facing a serious crisis. How is it that our glorious Red Army has abandoned several cities? Do the German fascist troops possess the invincible qualities constantly boasted by fascist propagandists? History proves that there is no eternally victorious army. Napoleon's army was regarded as invincible, but it was eventually defeated successively by Russian, British, and German troops. During the First Imperialist War, the army of Wilhelm II of Germany was also regarded as invincible, but it was also repeatedly defeated by Russian, British, and French troops, and finally crushed by the Allied forces. The same is true of today's Hitlerite fascist army. This army has not encountered strong resistance on the European continent until it met strong resistance within our territory. If the result of this resolute resistance has already led to the defeat of Hitler's most elite troops by the Red Army, then this army will inevitably be crushed like the armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.</p>
<p>As for the occupation of a part of our territory, this is because the situation at the beginning of the war was favorable to the German army and unfavorable to our side. Germany is a war-ready country, and its army is fully mobilized. The 170 divisions of troops sent to the Soviet border were all fully prepared and only waiting for the order to attack. Conversely, the Soviet army was still awaiting mobilization and had not been sent to the border. In this regard, one point is also particularly important. Fascist Germany suddenly and treacherously violated the Non-Aggression Pact concluded in 1939. Although this action has already caused Germany to be regarded as an aggressor, the German side is determined to disregard world opinion. Our peace-loving country, unwilling to be the first to violate the treaty, could not take treacherous and unjust actions. Then, why did the Soviet government agree to conclude a Non-Aggression Pact with the treacherous Hitler and Ribbentrop? Is this not the fault of the Soviet Union itself? No. The Non-Aggression Pact is actually a peace agreement between two countries. What Germany proposed to us in 1939 was also this type of agreement. Could the Soviet government refuse this proposal? I believe that any peace-loving country has no reason to refuse to conclude a peace agreement with a neighboring country, even if the leaders of that neighboring country are the likes of Hitler and Ribbentrop. However, there was also a necessary condition for the Soviet Union to conclude this type of agreement. In other words, this peace treaty does not directly or indirectly infringe upon the territorial integrity, independence, and honor of peace-loving countries. The Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact also contained this type of clause. Then, what benefits have we gained from concluding this treaty with Germany? It has given our country one and a half years of peace and military preparation to prevent fascist Germany from risking an attack on our country in violation of the treaty. This point is absolutely beneficial to us and greatly unfavorable to fascist Germany.</p>
<p>Then, what are the gains and losses of Germany violating the treaty? The German army has gained a short-term advantage, but in political terms, German fascism has exposed its hideous face and is undoubtedly regarded by the world as a cruel enemy. This short-term military gain of the German side is only a coincidence, while the Soviet Union's great political gain is a permanent factor that promotes the Red Army to achieve decisive military success. At present, our heroic Red Army, Navy, and the excellent people of Europe, America, Asia, and even Germany, unanimously condemn the treacherous behavior of German fascism and express sympathy for the Soviet government, and also believe that we are fighting for justice, the enemy will be defeated, and victory will belong to us.</p>
<p>This war, which has forced us to join, has made our country engage in a life-and-death struggle with its most vicious and faithless enemy, German fascism. Our army is bravely fighting against the enemy equipped with tanks and aircraft, overcoming countless difficulties, and not easily giving up every inch of national territory. The main force of the Red Army is about to begin operations. They are equipped with countless tanks and aircraft. The Red Army soldiers are showing great courage. Our resistance is increasing day by day, and the entire Soviet people are also rising up unanimously to defend the national territory. How can we overcome the difficulties and defeat the enemy? Most importantly, the Soviet people must understand the depth of the threat our country is facing and abandon all complacency, carelessness, and peaceful construction work. Because war has changed everything. What was applicable before the war is no longer applicable now. The enemy is cruel and has irreconcilable hatred with us. They have now come to seize the land nourished by our sweat and the grains and oils obtained by our labor. They want to restore the rule of the landlords and Tsarist imperialism, destroy our culture and the survival of the free nationalities of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Uzbekistan, Tatar, and other Soviet republics, and make them slaves of the German emperor's sons and dukes. Therefore, this war is actually a struggle for the life and death of the Soviet state and the Soviet people. Whether the Soviet Union will continue to enjoy freedom or be reduced to slavery depends on this decisive war. The Soviet people must understand this point and abandon all carelessness. They should mobilize their own strength and reorganize their work according to wartime needs. There should be no forgiveness for the enemy.</p>
<p>Especially important is that there should be no cowards or deserters in our ranks. In the war, we should have great fearlessness and must immediately participate in this patriotic struggle for freedom, to eliminate fascism that specializes in enslaving others. Our great founding father Lenin said that the advantages of the Soviet people should be courage, fearlessness, and preparedness to fight alongside other nations against our enemies. This Bolshevik characteristic should be extended to the Red Army, the Navy, and all nationalities of the Soviet Union. All our work should be immediately reorganized according to wartime measures. Everything should be in accordance with the needs of the front line and the work of destroying the enemy. German fascism extremely hates our country, which gives freedom and prosperity to the working masses. The Soviet people must rise up unanimously to fight the enemy and defend their sovereignty and territory. The Red Army, the Red Navy, and all Soviet citizens must defend every inch of Soviet territory, defend the towns and cities with the last drop of blood, and show our traditional courage and wisdom. We must do everything possible to help the Red Army, ensure the supply of reinforcements and supplies to the Red Army troops and the transportation of military supplies, and improve the rescue of wounded soldiers. We must strengthen the rear of the Red Army. All work must be based on this as a starting point. All our industries should intensify their work, manufacturing large quantities of bullets, guns, and aircraft. We should closely guard all factories and power plants, and improve air defense work. At the same time, we should eliminate and sweep away deserters, rumor-mongers, enemy spies, and paratroopers in the rear.</p>
<p>We must know that the enemy is extremely cunning and good at treachery and spreading rumors. Do not be fooled by these tricks. Anyone who is timid and obstructs national defense work, no matter who they are, will be dealt with by military tribunals. If the Red Army has to retreat, all vehicles must be evacuated. Not a single train, a pound of grain, or a gallon of gasoline must be left behind for the enemy to use. Collective farmers should disperse all livestock and hand over the grain to the authorities for transportation to the rear. As for valuable items that cannot be moved, such as non-ferrous metals, grain, and gasoline, they must be destroyed. In the occupied territories, guerrilla units should be organized to launch guerrilla warfare everywhere, destroying bridges and roads, and burning shops and freight vehicles. In short, everything must be done to make it impossible for the enemy to gain a foothold. This decisive war cannot be compared to ordinary wars. This is not only a battle between two armies, but also a struggle of the entire Soviet people against fascism. The purpose of the battle is not only to eliminate the immediate threat to our country, but also to help the people groaning under the bondage of German fascism. In this war for freedom, we will not be isolated and helpless. In this decisive war, we will gain the loyal cooperation of Europe, America, and the Germans enslaved by Hitler.</p>
<p>Our war for freedom has merged with the war for independence and democratic freedom in Europe and Asia, forming a united front against Hitler. In this regard, the British Prime Minister's remarks in support of the Soviet Union and the US government's declaration of readiness to assist our country have aroused the gratitude of the Soviet people and are very easy to understand.</p>
<p>Comrades, our strength is boundless. The enemy will soon realize this. Countless workers, peasants, and cultural figures have risen up unanimously to fight alongside the Red Army against the enemy. The working masses of Moscow and Leningrad have begun to collect large numbers of national troops to assist the Red Army. All cities that feel the threat of aggression should establish this type of national army. We should awaken the working masses to defend their freedom, glory, and country. In order to quickly mobilize the strength of the Soviet people to repel the enemy, we have organized a State Defense Committee, which has full power to handle state affairs. The State Defense Committee has begun its work and requests the people to strengthen their support for the Lenin-Stalin Party and the government, and to assist the Red Army Navy in order to defeat the enemy and gain victory. All forces must be used to assist the heroic Red Army and the glorious Red Navy. All forces must be used to destroy the enemy's advance and advance towards the path of victory."</p>

<h3>US Independence Day; Grew Delivers a Speech; Says Democratic System is Now Being Tested; Americans Must Have Faith to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tokyo, United Press, 4th. US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, gave a speech at the American Club today to celebrate Independence Day, saying that the United States and other parts of the world are currently experiencing a period of turbulence and tension. At this time, important decisions should be made, and resolute actions should be taken based on these decisions. Grew addressed more than 250 guests, including British Ambassador Craigie and Australian Minister Lanin, who were invited to the July 4th reception. He said, "We are no longer drifting aimlessly, nor are we anchored and unmoving. We are advancing against the wind, but we are still sailing, resolutely sailing. Democracy is now being tested, perhaps more than ever before. The culture we know is in danger, and humanity is in danger. At this time, the most important thing is that we should revive our faith in our country and everything it represents. As a country, as a nation, we should have an absolutely united front. I believe that these headwinds will undoubtedly turn us into favorable conditions. Democracy will be victorious, culture will be victorious, and humanity will be victorious. Because in dealing with human affairs, the forces of construction often and inevitably overcome the forces of destruction. But in moving towards our goals, we must work together with consistent faith. We will do it with democratic procedures, and the true test of democracy lies in our full, firm, and united support for it. Gentlemen, I would like to offer a toast on behalf of the President."</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan; Meets with Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 4th. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Foreign Minister Matsuoka at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Japan Pays Close Attention to the United States Supplying the Soviet Union; Vladivostok's Position Close to Japan; Japanese Government is Studying Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Havas, 4th. The Hochi Shimbun published an editorial today discussing the possibility of the United States supplying the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. This is the first time that Japanese newspapers have openly discussed this issue. It stated, in brief, that if the United States transports military supplies to the Soviet Union based on the Lend-Lease Act, the only way for these supplies to reach Vladivostok is through Japanese territorial waters. If that is the case, Soviet submarines will appear there, and the war will expand to the Japanese coast. If American merchant ships do not pass through Hakodate Port north of Hokkaido, but through the Soya Strait south of Hokkaido, on their way to Vladivostok, the government should take various steps to prevent it. This view of the newspaper has attracted much attention. Cabinet Information Bureau spokesman Ishii acknowledged at a press conference today that the Japanese government has recently been studying this issue, because the Sea of Japan is an open sea and ships of any country can pass through. It is generally said here that preventing American merchant ships from passing through the Sea of Japan is tantamount to blockading Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 4th. At a meeting with foreign reporters today, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked if the Japanese government agreed with the newspapers regarding the United States' aid to the Soviet Union. The spokesman replied, "We must wait and see whether the United States will transport military supplies to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. He has not yet decided whether he will transport this." The spokesman also recalled his remarks on Tuesday that this move would put Japan in a troubled and difficult position. When asked why a friendly country transporting goods to another friendly country would cause this, the spokesman replied, "Because it passes through a place close to Japan." When asked whether the Tsugaru and Soya Straits are not specified in the treaty as being available for international transport, the spokesman replied that the Japanese government had recently discussed the issue of Japanese territorial waters, but he could not say whether this discussion was about declaring a "safe area" as the United States had done, or about formally expanding the empty territorial sea area. The spokesman also said that Japan's attitude towards the Soviet-German war had been conveyed to the Soviet ambassador, but he could not say more than what had already been announced. When asked about foreign reports that the Japanese government had recalled Japanese ships sailing in foreign waters, the spokesman replied that he was not aware of this matter and could not comment. When asked about the foreign rumors that the United States was encircling Japan, the spokesman replied, "The facts will prove everything," and then touched on the US-Burma trade agreement. The spokesman said that legally, this was a commercial deal and had nothing to do with Japan, but it was indeed an unfriendly act towards Japan, as it should be known that aid to Chongqing will be further strengthened because of Burma.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 4th. Foreign Minister Matsuoka reported to the Cabinet meeting today on the recent diplomatic situation and the circumstances of his meeting with the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union on Wednesday after the Imperial Conference decided on Japan's fundamental policy towards the new international situation.

<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 4th. The Kokumin Shimbun's editorial today stated that the Soviet-German war has reached the globe in its importance and scale, and we must change our point of view and prepare in advance. Now, in addition to the problem of Japan's difficult situation in the China Incident, there is also the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States, which have been hostile to Japan since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, are trying to aid the Soviet Union in order to overwhelm Germany. The result of the Soviet-German war is not limited to these two countries, but will determine the future of the world, the future of East Asia, and will determine the fate of Japan. The article stated that it is still unknown what policy the Japanese government will take towards the current and future world situation, and then said that we now know that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing all regard the China Incident and the Soviet-German war as inseparable issues. The United States will eventually join the war. If that is the case, then Southwestern Pacific Singapore Burma Vladivostok Kamchatka will not become important issues, but will be a world war to the end. The article warned the people to prepare to cope with the very urgent situation recently referred to by Foreign Minister Matsuoka.</p>

<p>New York, Reuters, 4th. Personnel from the New York branch of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha company claimed that they had not received orders to end navigation services. Since the start of the war against China, the Japanese government has requisitioned 50% of the company's ships. Two more were micro-used last week. Some ships have withdrawn from the Atlantic Ocean due to slack business.</p>
<p>Manila, Reuters, 4th.

Chief of Staff General Marshall requested authorization from the Army Department to order 2.5 million conscripted soldiers, in accordance with government regulations, to remain in the National Guard Reserve after completing their one-year term of service. The purpose of Marshall's desire to remove this restriction is to enable the US Army to serve anywhere in the world. It is reported that Army Chief Colonel Stimson has approved the principles of this proposal and will submit it to Congress and request Congress to pass it, allowing the US Army to be stationed outside the Western Hemisphere. According to Marshall, US conscripted soldiers are currently scattered all over the world, as far as Hawaii and Alaska, so it is very beneficial to keep them in the army after their term of service has expired. Marshall also strongly stated that it is very likely that the enemy will attack the United States anytime and anywhere, so the interests of the United States are now at great risk. The Hyde Park side did not comment on this proposal, as it is still under close study.</p>

Paderewski had always opposed the tragedy of bloodshed, the rampant desires of man, and the enslavement of mankind. His soul in heaven will again pray for the freedom of his country and the world, he said. While the Archbishop delivered his eulogy, the guests listened in solemn silence.

An hour later, it received instructions from Moscow and suddenly flew back. People here were surprised and speculated. As for how the aircraft was ordered to return, it is not yet known. It may be due to the fact that the capital of a certain country has fought or severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and it is also possible that the Soviet minister in that place boarded the plane. The Afghan minister, who recently arrived here from Vienna, was also on board. Among the British delegation members who continued their journey were two commercial counselors, one of whom was an expert in Romanian oil fields, two army officers, and one code translator.</p>
<h3>Vichy Is Willing to Be a Nazi Pawn, Heading Down the Path of Self-Destruction; Mass Arrests in France of Those Sympathetic to Russia</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 4th: "Pravda" commented on the Vichy government's severance of relations with the Soviet Union, saying that the Vichy government's domestic and foreign policies had fully proved that it was only a pawn of the German fascists. The Vichy leaders have taken the path of destruction, continuing to betray the interests of France. What they are implementing is a guilty and traitorous policy. There is no reason to sever relations with the Soviet Union, which is only a crime against the honor of the French people. The French people are now clenching their fists and waiting for the time of revenge to come, when fascist thugs and their parties will be driven out of France, it said. Soviet newspapers also mentioned that a large number of French people suspected of sympathizing with the Soviet Union have been arrested.</p>

<h3>Six Japanese Members of the House of Representatives to Visit South America</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th: Six members of the Japanese House of Representatives recently crossed the sea to visit various South American countries for a period of four months. They are scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on July 19. This trip was planned by Congressman Wen in June, indicating Japan's emphasis on commercial relations with South America. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, this route of commerce has become important because Japanese commerce with Germany has completely stopped, and commerce with the Scandinavian countries has also ceased due to traffic interruptions. After the six congressmen arrive in Los Angeles, they will take a Pan American Airlines flight to Mexico City, stay there for five days, and then take a car to Acapulco, where they will tour for one day, and then take a boat to Balboa, and then take a plane to the Peruvian capital and then to Rio de Janeiro, passing through many cities along the way, and are scheduled to return home on October 9.</p>

<h3>Food: On the Pretext of Low Stock, Rice Speculators Are Trying Again; It Is Appropriate to Adopt Necessary Measures for the Entire People's Food Supply; Do Not Think That the Small Amount of Rice Stock Is Enough to Not Worry About the Future</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of foreign rice was raised again by the active speculation of merchants. As far as the actual sales in this street are concerned, in addition to the more than 100,000 public sales of small-grained rice in stock, there are also 80,000 public sales of small-grained fixed rice allocated from the public warehouse. Therefore, there is no need to revive the market in this street. The market should stabilize the public sale price. However, the rice market is spreading rumors again, saying that the foreign rice stock is gradually decreasing day by day (it is said that it is less than one million bags, only a little more than one-third of the maximum). The source, except for the recent batch of road goods arriving at the port, also has subsequent batches of fixed goods, which seem to be temporarily delayed in loading to Shanghai to observe the situation. The truth or falsity of the facts is unclear, which makes both buyers and sellers tend to be firm. It is common to see small purchases and high sales. Early in the morning, there were villagers from the inland countryside taking advantage of the cheapness to sell. The shops on this street also embellished it. The buying momentum was strong, forming a scramble and a game of passing the buck, which caused a stir, and the price increased slightly, returning to the peak of the previous day, rising by one or two yuan compared to the closing price of that day. The prices are as follows: No. 1 Saigon 128.5 yuan, No. 2 123 yuan, Middle Guan 120.05 yuan, Special No. 1 Siam 133 yuan, No. 2 123 yuan, Middle Guan 120.05 yuan, Fire Grain 126 yuan, Cafro Rice 127 yuan, Min Dang Special 132 yuan, Middle Guan 128-9 yuan, Small Pattern 124.3 yuan, 124 yuan, Tokyo Pointed 113.5 yuan, Middle to 111 yuan, Rice Lu 113-4 yuan, Broken Pointed 96.5 yuan, Special Red Bell Brand 98 yuan. However, the various inland routes and the Ningbo Yangtze gangs only responded with small amounts, and immediately withdrew when the price was high. Those who made a floating profit kicked out immediately when the price was high. Therefore, the market price rose and then flattened. As a result, it was only slightly higher than the day before. The Yinghua Company was more popular because of the patronage of the merchants. No. 2 Siam opened at 143.5 yuan to 144.5 yuan for July deliveries. Small grains of current road goods are all from 150 yuan to 151 yuan. Broken rice is 116 yuan for immediate delivery and 113.5 yuan. 1,800 tons were traded, and there are 16-17,000 bags of current rice. In this situation, how to maintain the rice stock in Shanghai, and how to continue the future fixed rice is related to the lives of millions of people in the city. It is fortunate not to think that a small amount of rice is enough to sit back and relax, and allow the rice price to have a chance to rise again. It seems that we should make plans as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin japonica rice, domestic rice and glutinous rice continues to be scarce. Seeing the high rise of foreign rice, people feel more firm. Not only those who have goods insist, but also the various retail and wholesale shops in this town are full of enthusiasm, and all prices are raised uniformly. Among them, the fresh early and late rice from Nangang is rare and widely sold, and the supply is insufficient for distribution. It opened from 139 yuan to 137 yuan. The original bags of 숙粳 (Sook Gyeong) from Wuxi recently have two types: large bags and small bags. Each large bag contains one 石 (Dan) and five 斗 (Du). Since the capacity is large, the sales volume is small, so it is only firm. Small bags are very popular with guests, and the price is increased by one yuan. However, both are still calculated per 석 (Dan) as usual. Because it is difficult to distinguish the selling price, it is still mixed and opened high from 132 yuan, up to 127 yuan. As for glutinous rice, foreign rice is more popular than domestic rice. For example, Hong Kong white rice has opened at 123-4 yuan, and middle-grade rice also needs about 120 yuan. Glutinous green rice is high from 112 yuan, up to 106-7 yuan. Although the price of Jin Dan domestic glutinous rice has also risen by one yuan, the sales volume is still less than that of the first. It is estimated that the high-grade rice is sold at 122-3 yuan, and the second-grade rice is sold at 119 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Need to Worry About the Scarcity of Starch; The Starch Market Is Competing to Transfer Downstream</h3>
<p>The current foreign starch market situation has taken a sharp turn downwards, because the continuous rise in recent days has been too fast, and it has been caused by speculators hoarding. In fact, the actual situation is very limited. Moreover, although the selling of cheap starch has been stopped, there is a large amount of starch in Shanghai, so there is no need to worry about the scarcity. Therefore, floating hoarders have emerged one after another. Golden Dragon starch opened at 33.05 yuan, and immediately fell into the 33 yuan range, loosening to 32.75 yuan, and Fort starch was 33.6 yuan, Five Swallow brand was 33.1 yuan to 33 yuan, each down by three or four corners. Other brands lack a proper market.</p>
<p>Wheat trading is still developing little because the new wheat has been under control and cannot be transported to Shanghai. However, with the report of rising prices of rice flour in recent days, people are in a better mood, and there are occasional sporadic sales of domestic wheat, which require a price of 45-6 yuan, while the purchase price at the factory gate of Japanese factories is still limited to 10 yuan, and has not been relaxed.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Hoarders Emerge; Oil Price Falls by One Yuan; Soybean Cake Price Also Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>Cooking Oil: Actual sales have gradually turned weak, and hoarders who have made profits have sold some, so the situation has slightly weakened, and the price has fallen by about one yuan compared to the previous period. It is estimated that 20 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold, with a price of 122 yuan, 200 cans of Jiangbei Benfang raw oil, with a price of 159 yuan, 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, with a price of 176 yuan, 150 bundles of Dayou Factory soybean oil, with a price of 130.05 yuan, and Char Siew oil 119 yuan, and another 122 yuan for July delivery. Also, 50 bags of soybeans will be transported to Hong Kong today (5th).</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Transactions were weaker yesterday, and hoarders also sold more and bought less. The situation was slightly flat and soft. It is estimated that 500 pieces of Li Zi soybean cake, 1,000 pieces of Lu Zi soybean cake, 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake, 2,000 pieces of Xian Ji soybean cake for spot goods, and more than 10,000 pieces of futures were sold. The price fell slightly by one or two corners compared to the previous period (see the market price column for details).</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Pangolin Scales Are Expensive</h3>
<p>Pangolin scales are very scarce in stock due to a long-term lack of arrivals. Yesterday, the company finally rushed to deliver two pieces of net goods, and the asking price reached more than 900 yuan. Compared with the spring market, it has become a ratio of two to one, which can be said to be extremely expensive.</p>

The black market for British and American exchange rates loosened first and then recovered. In the morning, because the rumors of the previous day dissipated, Huashang Bank, Shanghai Continental, and others still had supply. Most speculators did swaps, buying July and selling August, posting US$0.015625. More than 500,000 yuan was traded in the first half of the day. However, foreign companies such as Yuli and others still intended to buy. Importers had small amounts of money, and their positions were still abundant. In the afternoon, another odd peak rose. British banks such as HSBC and Yuli came to absorb again, and speculators also turned to plug and repull. Fortunately, American banks supplied, and although the US exchange rate tightened, it was also slight. It ended up at the same price as the previous day, while British gold was slightly firmer. Most transactions were swaps.</p>

The central listed prices for all currencies have not been reduced.

<h3>The Gold Market is Volatile</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market on the black market fluctuated, although not as much as the previous day, but the market price was unstable in the midst of rumors, falling first and then rising. After the 6,500 yuan mark was broken, it immediately returned. The morale of all parties turned firm after being tired. Since the foreign exchange rate was low, it was rumored that the cabinet would be reorganized soon, and the relationship between the United States and Germany was tense. It was said that the US military had landed in Iceland. The Shanghai West Gang in the venue continued to emerge, selling more than 10,000 taels of US dollars. Chengji Gold Store competed to sell more than 2,000 taels, retail investors sold short, and the price was pressed from 6,542 yuan to 6,495 yuan. Tianyuan tended to cover shorts, trying to save the decline. In the afternoon, it was heard that HSBC came to absorb again, the US exchange rate tended to tighten, and Tianyuan and bill merchants violently covered, the securities gang competed to buy, and retail shorts were eager to turn long, and the price jumped straight up again, pushing up to a high price of 6,543 yuan, and finally made up for a small 14 yuan. However, by the end of the market, it had risen to 6,553.5 yuan, which required an increase of several yuan. The total daily transaction was 70-80,000 taels, and cash transactions were scarce again. Yongfeng sold 50 taels to Zhongxing, with the price 280 yuan higher than the term transaction. The afternoon did not do business, and also made up for a small number of yuan. The decorative gold has been listed for a small 5 yuan, which is 700 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Recovered Little</p>
<p>Since this morning, each article (ten taels), opened at 9:15 at 6,535 yuan, which was 16 yuan lower than the calculated price, and reached 30 yuan. Decheng, Tianyuan, and Dafeng made great progress, and suddenly rose to 6,542 yuan. Unexpectedly, the company Chengji and Yiyuan of the Shanghai West Gang suddenly came to emerge, and Gongda Yili also sold, retreating to between 6,512 yuan. After circulating for a long time, until 10:30, Yiyuan and Chengji's selling intention became stronger, and the foreign exchange softened, and the price continued to fall by more than ten yuan, breaking into 6,500 yuan, inferior to 6,495 yuan. Xinyuan, Shunyuan, and Tianyuan absorbed one after another, and gradually rose to 6,517 yuan. Soon, it rose again. The noon closing was 6,506 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2 o'clock at 6,508 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the calculated price. Then, the big players went in and out differently, and rose again to 6,514 yuan, and forked back down to 6,505 yuan. Tianyuan Dafeng, Yida, Defu, Xinfeng Yonglai made great progress, and it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was tight, and retail investors turned long, and the price gradually rose by 38 yuan, reaching 6,543 yuan. Litailei sold, down to 6,533 yuan. The 2:30 closing was 6,537 yuan, which was 14 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous night. Calculated at a closing price of 5.28125 yuan for the US dollar in July, it was 6,594 yuan, and the printing was 57 yuan. After the closing, Hesheng Xiangfeng Yonglai bought in, pushing up to 6,553.5 yuan. The daily (excluding outside the market) difference was 48 yuan. The selling price of the company's own brand gold was 290 yuan higher than the black market term trading price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. The current bid gold had no price and no market.</p>
<p>The Decorative Gold Was Listed for a Small 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The asking price for silver building jewelry gold per tael was 700 yuan for both Datongxing and Xintongxing at 10:30, which was reduced by 40 yuan for buying in.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rebounded in the Aftermarket; Foreign Stock Trading Was Also Active</h3>
<p>Public bond black market, the market situation yesterday, in the morning, the price decreased again due to the sale by Beidi and others, and the C kind almost broke 71 yuan. In the afternoon, the selling pressure was slightly lower, and it went back up, slightly higher than the previous day. The pursuit of the long side was very large, and the transfer of the short side was also large. During this period of change of ownership by the long side, I am afraid it will inevitably hover. Yesterday morning, the Bei gang sold a large amount, such as Datong Changji emerged very strongly, Hongda continued to vent the long side, and Runchang also sought to sell. Lianhe bought in, and Xinfu also received a little. Yongchang's buying was not weak, and Feng Yi Tai was still consistently purchasing. However, the selling pressure was still very strong. The noon closing was slightly tired by two or three corners. In the afternoon, the momentum of the sellers receded slightly, and Hengkang Shengda Jianda Shun and Jiufeng were all sold. Runde Dingkang Lianyi and Xinhua bought in, and the table suddenly changed from seeking to supplying, and the market prices were all slightly higher by three or four corners. As a result, they all recovered by two and a half to six corners, with a transaction volume of 2 million yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory shares were traded, with a price of 19.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the stock market of various industries is still active, the price has tended to decrease. The trading of various famous stocks is very active. The transaction volume of Asian stocks is estimated to be 88,000 shares, and the rubber stocks are also frequently traded in and out, and the price has also tended to be soft.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Ball Deflates; The Spot Yarn Market Feels Chilly; Actual Sales Also Present a Stalemate Due to Excessive Price Increases</h3>
<p>Since the bankruptcy of the short-sellers in the yarn market, the trading of leather balls in the market has greatly deflated. Fortunately, it has not yet broken, so it has become a situation where there is no opponent to fight. If you want to buy in, you can't buy in, and if you want to sell, you can't sell out. The extraordinary liveliness of the past has now turned into a scattered image. At the same time, the spot yarn business is not as prosperous as it was on the previous day. In fact, the shippers' prices are very high, and the merchant gangs have no way to start. As a result, a stalemate has emerged. Even today, only 180 pieces need to be transported to Hong Kong. From this point of view, the Shuangma market may have a period of coldness before turning prosperous again. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,625 yuan, and the low price was 1,588 yuan. In the afternoon, the number of people was sparse, and the shouted prices were inconsistent. At first, it was priced at 1,591-2 yuan, and then it was around 1,600 yuan. The transaction was minimal. Zhaoxing Yarn Factory opened the price of 18-count Weaver Yarn at 1,265 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and the popularity was still good. The first price was 1,620 yuan, and after a while, it fell to 1,617-8 yuan. It was heard that the opening of the bid gold was still good, rising to 1,625 yuan. However, the customer sales were mediocre, and those who made profits spit out. At the same time, the market conditions of the various exchanges were sluggish, and the selling wind was even stronger, gradually falling to 1,592 yuan at the close. It was found that the turnover in half a day was 5,310 bags, including 310 bags imported by the Hong Kong gang and 5,000 bags of leather ball business by the counterparts.</p>
<p>The market situation of Jin Shuangma bid yarn: The opening price was close to falling in the near term and rising in the far term. Then, the spot yarn trading was not prosperous, which caused the profit-makers to spit out and fall back down. As a result, the July period fell by 21 yuan, the August period fell by 9 yuan, and the September period rose by 6 yuan. The statistics of the turnover throughout the day were 24,000 bags, which was 5,980 bags more than the previous period. The daily high, low, and closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Closing Price</p>
<p>July 1487 145 1467</p>
<p>August 1491 1465 1479</p>
<p>September 1525 1510 1523</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Rises and Sales Level Off</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation: Because of the continuous rise in recent days, the momentum has been slightly flat today due to the decline in the yarn market. However, the counterparts bought and sold each other, totaling 900 pieces, and the price rose by 2-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai: Because the factory and flower companies are not bad at buying, the spot cotton transaction is still smooth. The selling price of 40-count raw material American California cotton and high-grade Brazilian cotton is close to 490 yuan. Yesterday, in addition to the Chinese factories and flower companies buying a large amount of Brazilian cotton and American cotton, the Japanese yarn factories were even more eager to buy, with a turnover of no less than 1,000 bags. As for the situation of forward foreign cotton orders, it is inferior because the source is blocked and transportation is difficult, and the market price is not as fiercely high as that of spot cotton.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloths Profitable Resales</h3>
<p>Factory Cloths: Yesterday's market declined, influenced by Eastern Piece Goods. Sentiment remains firm, with considerable reselling for profit. As a result, white cloth and fine twills fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece, coarse cloths fell by 2.5 jiao, while bleached and dyed cloths saw little change. This street traded over 300 pieces of autumn-season futures, including flannel and gray cloth, over 200 pieces of poplin, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth, and over 500 pieces of various bleached, dyed, and printed cloths handled by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang traders. 300 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 5th.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloths: Yesterday's market saw initial gains followed by declines, with significant fluctuations. Fine cloths fell sharply due to the sharp drop in exchange futures, with forward spot orders also declining. The closing price for the future market was 48.9 yuan, down 7 jiao. However, mid-range fine cloth brands saw active sales and positive sentiment among traders, declining only about 5 jiao per piece. Fine twills also remained firm, with blue double-fish dyes particularly popular, rising by 5 jiao. The "Four Gentlemen" serge rose to 1.65 yuan in the morning market, but negative news pushed it down to 1.6 yuan. Ultimately, due to absorption by large buyers, it rebounded to 1.62 yuan, with little overall change.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Declines Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was affected by the appreciation of foreign exchange, leading to a downward trend. The association's set prices were 94 to 3 yuan and 2.6 yuan for new Grade 2/4 coarse white sugar, down a small 1.9 jiao. Old cargo arriving in March/April was priced at 92 yuan to 1 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B-Mark was at 109 yuan, down 1 yuan. YD Mark in-bound was at 100 yuan, and HX Mark was at 91 yuan, down a small 1.5 yuan. Dutch Red KD Mark was at 74.2 jiao and 73.5 jiao, down 9 jiao, and NT Mark was at 72.5 yuan to 1 yuan, down a small 1.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was U.S. Independence Day: Shanghai American Community Celebrated Grandly; Unprecedented Scene; Enthusiastic and Courageous Spirit; Allied Nations People's Association Sent Congratulatory Telegram; Shanghai Residents Could Listen to President Roosevelt's Broadcast This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 165th anniversary of the founding of the United States. The American community in this city and American people around the world commemorated the difficulty of their forefathers in creating the Republic. Today, inheriting their legacy, they are able to enjoy the rights of independence and freedom. Therefore, every year on this glorious occasion, a grand celebration is held. Today, with aggressors engaging in militarism and warfare everywhere, the lives, property, and honor of the American people are under threat. It is essential to emulate the brave, resolute, and sacrificial spirit of their forefathers to continue to uphold independence and overcome difficulties in resisting tyrannical politics. Therefore, this year's grand celebration is of great significance. Yesterday, American official and commercial institutions in this city took a day off, displaying flags to celebrate. All prescribed ceremonies, such as flag-raising, military parades, receptions for foreign guests, banquets, sports games, dances, etc., were held separately in a grand and enthusiastic atmosphere. The grand occasion is recorded below.</p>
<p>Allied Nations People Sent Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>The Allied Nations People's Association of this city sent a special telegram to U.S. President Roosevelt yesterday to offer congratulations. The original telegram stated, "On this U.S. Independence Day, the Shanghai Allied Nations People's Association respectfully extends congratulations and gratitude to the American people, for your generous assistance to all people fighting for the Four Freedoms."</p>
<p>Military Parade Displayed Impressive Military Bearing</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment held a flag-raising and military parade at the Racecourse. In addition to a large portion of the American community in this city, many other foreigners attended the ceremony. Colonel Howard, the commander of the regiment, served as the reviewing officer. Accompanying him were U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, Rear Admiral Grasford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, Dr. Mindstead, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, and many others. Before the inspection, U.S. Consul General Lockhart distributed a U.S. flag to each American child. At that time, flags fluttered, and the military bearing was impressive.</p>
<p>Banquet and Sports Games Enlivened the Day</p>
<p>From 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, U.S. Consul General Lockhart hosted a banquet at the Columbia Country Club to entertain diplomatic representatives from various countries in Shanghai and leaders of the American business community. Many foreign guests came to offer their congratulations. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the American Chamber of Commerce held its annual traditional memorial meeting at its clubhouse on Fuzhou Road, where everyone stood in silence to bless U.S. President Roosevelt. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the U.S. Navy and amateur players from this city held a softball game, with Colonel Howard throwing the first pitch. The result was a loss by three runs, with a score of twelve to nine. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, a polo match was held, which was a rare sight in this city, so there were many spectators. At 8:15 PM, a "You Must Defend America" broadcast program was hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce and broadcast by XMHA radio station, with XMHC and XCDN rebroadcasting. Speakers included British Consul General in Shanghai, George, and many others. The final commemorative event was a dance party at the Columbia Country Club, which lasted late into the night.</p>
<p>U.S. National Emblem Flutters (Ultra)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt gave a speech in the afternoon at 3:15 PM, broadcast by the U.S. San Francisco GKE radio station. It was rebroadcast once at 10:30 PM that night. The American Radio Station in this city decided to rebroadcast it this morning when the radio station made its second broadcast. According to the time difference between U.S. time and Shanghai time, which is thirteen hours, 10:30 PM on the evening of the 4th corresponds to 11:30 AM today in this city.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Published Article Celebrating</p>
<p>The Shanghai North-China Daily News published an article commenting on this great U.S. event, titled "American Day." The article stated that on this day when American people around the world celebrate Independence Day, countries that are fighting for precious freedom should be vigilant about the freedom lost by countries controlled by the Nazis. Although the United States has not yet participated in the war, its national leaders do not want to involve the United States in a dangerous vortex. However, the American people all understand their situation and are under threat, so they are working hard to assist all those who are fighting for freedom to resist violence. The United States is the arsenal of democracy, and the entire country is stepping up production of various munitions to supply all countries that are resisting dictatorship. Heavy industries are currently expanding to meet the needs of extraordinary times, and new industries are also developing to transcend the growth of evil forces. This is most consistent with the true meaning of the Declaration of Independence, which states, "All people are created equal, and they are endowed with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." These words have never been taken into account by the Nazis, who have no concept of justice in their minds and regard freedom as national property, so they oppose the American system of government and freedom. Today, nations fighting for independence and freedom will celebrate this Independence Day together with the American people, because without independence, there is no survival.</p>
<h3>Fourteen American Missionaries to Return to the U.S. Within Days</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a total of fourteen American missionaries in China will depart for the U.S. this week. Among them, four missionaries from the Southern Baptist Convention are scheduled to leave Shanghai for the U.S. for vacation on the President Pierce steamship on the 5th. American Presbyterian missionaries will depart on the Japanese ship Ryuta Maru. Three missionaries from the American Methodist Episcopal Church will return to the U.S.</p>

<h3>Fuxing Ship Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The English-language Great Evening American reports that the British ship Fuxing, belonging to the Jardine Matheson Company, along with its captain, an Englishman named Holton, and a Russian sailor, were recently kidnapped by pirates in Xiashan Bay (transliteration) off the coast of Zhejiang. They were subsequently rescued by a Japanese naval patrol boat and have now transferred to a British ship returning to Hong Kong today (the 4th). It is reported that the Fuxing was forced to anchor south of Xiashan Bay on June 18th due to bad weather. Two days later, the captain and the Russian sailor were taken hostage by pirates, while the Fuxing set sail for Hong Kong without waiting for their release. After receiving a report, the Japanese dispatched a patrol boat, rescuing the two men. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong today, it was reported yesterday that the British ship that had been robbed has arrived in Hong Kong today. It is now known that those boarding the ship were not pirates, but Chinese men in uniform. It is believed that these men were military police from the Japanese-controlled coastal area.</p>
<h3>BBC Broadcasts</h3>
<p>The BBC in London broadcasts two types of programs every week, international and Cantonese, and has been doing so for several years. They can be received in this city. Mandarin broadcasts begin every Tuesday evening at 7:30 PM, and Cantonese broadcasts take place every Wednesday evening at 7:38 PM. The wavelength of the station is 16.86, and the frequency is 17790.</p>
<h3>Measures to Maintain Exchange Rate Agreed Upon; Fox to Return to Chongqing; Sino-British Stabilization Agreement Also Extended; Review of Preventing Arbitrage Yields Results</h3>
<p>Mr. Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Board, and his assistant, Mr. Taylor, came to Shanghai and met with various economic experts to conduct a thorough review of the Shanghai black market exchange rate. They have prepared a detailed report with recommendations and will soon leave Shanghai for Hong Kong before returning to Chongqing to report back.</p>
<p>Agreement Extension Boosts Confidence</p>
<p>The $50 million U.S. dollar Sino-American Stabilization Fund has now expired since the agreement was signed. Recently, the agreement was signed again by Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Bank of China, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to continue the agreement for another year, from July 1, 1941, to June 30, 1942. Since the news spread to Shanghai, the financial market has been greatly encouraged. The £5 million Sino-British Stabilization Fund agreement was signed long ago, and although there is a fixed term, the agreement stipulates that it can be extended after the term expires. This proves that the British and American governments are determined to provide monetary support to China.</p>
<p>Measures to Maintain Exchange Rate Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The main factors affecting the fluctuations of the black market exchange rate in Shanghai are (1) the bill market, (2) the foreign currency market, and (3) the gold market. The bill market is dominated by banks, the foreign currency market is dominated by money changers, and the gold market is dominated by money changers and gold shops. The prices in the three markets are interdependent. Mr. Fox and economic experts discussed with the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China, as well as banks such as HSBC and Citibank, and have agreed on appropriate measures to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, to avoid the drawbacks of arbitrage and speculation, and to protect the interests of legitimate merchants.</p>

<h3>Second Phase Hong Kong Rice Price Undecided; Public Warehouse Rice Arrives in City Today; Rice Shops Avoid Weight Disputes by Switching to Market Scales</h3>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice has arrived in this city in recent days. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the General G. G. A. Varenne (S.S.G.G.A.Varenne), an American ship represented by the Weily-Han Company, recently transported rice from Vietnam to Shanghai. Due to encountering a hurricane, it was delayed for three days and is expected to arrive in port today, scheduled to dock at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading, carrying a total of 34,000 bags of Rangoon rice. In addition, the Norwegian merchant ship Gran was also delayed due to the wind and is expected to arrive in port this afternoon. The ship is carrying 27,150 bags of foreign rice from Rangoon, scheduled to dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The Burmese foreign rice on this ship is the public-interest rice of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Issue Market Scales as Basis</p>
<p>At present, the authorities of the two settlements are paying close attention to the private price hikes and deductions in weight by various retail rice shops. Several rice shops have been found to have committed fraud and have been punished by the court. As a result, some rice shops in the two settlements have issued statements to avoid similar incidents, stating that rice will be sold based on market scales in the future. The original text is as follows: "This shop sells affordable foreign rice and all types of rice. To avoid disputes, all purchases of five dou or more will be weighed using market scales and will not be measured by dou. Please pay attention, each dou of affordable foreign rice weighs 16 market catties, and each dou of other rice weighs 15 catties and 10 taels."</p>
<p>Second Phase Hong Kong Rice Negotiating Price</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's second phase of foreign rice has also been loaded onto ships in Hong Kong and is continuing to be transported to Shanghai. The first batch is expected to arrive next week. It is rumored that the wholesale price of this rice will need to be increased by 4 yuan per bag due to the increased shipping costs from Rangoon to Hong Kong, but this has not been confirmed. However, it is said that the retail price will not be affected, as the Standing Committee has repeatedly stated that it will wait until the first phase of foreign rice and the public warehouse rice are completely sold out before convening a meeting to discuss changing the retail price.</p>
<h3>North China Postage Stamps Are Inscribed with Place Names; This is Done by the Beijing Post Office; It is Crucial to the Postal System</h3>
<p>The Beijing Post Office suddenly inscribed place names on the surface of airmail stamps issued by post offices in Beijing, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu. This move is worth noting for the entire postal system. The Datong News Agency reporter now records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Postage Stamp Style is Uniform Throughout the Country</p>
<p>The postage stamps of post offices throughout the country are issued by the Kunming Postal Administration and are printed in Hong Kong, commonly known as the Hong Kong version postage stamps. These postage stamps are affixed and used in all occupied areas. In Hebei, the stamps are issued by the General Post Office to the Beijing Postal Administration, which distributes them to post offices in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu for the public to affix.</p>
<p>Beijing Post Office Adds Place Names</p>
<p>Recently, the Beijing Post Office has determined that the chips currently used in North China account for a considerable amount. The value of these chips is now the same as that of Japanese military currency, while the legal currency in North China is forcibly suppressed. For this reason, some people bring postage stamps to North China and exchange them for local chips. The Beijing Post Office considers this to be an encroachment on the interests of the post office.</p>
<p>Discovered in This City Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, the Beijing Post Office inscribed the place names Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu on the postage stamps. These printed postage stamps are only allowed to be affixed at post offices within the provinces. Those without place names are rejected. This move is crucial to the postal administration system and deserves attention. These postage stamps began to be discovered in Shanghai yesterday. The typeface is quite large and is inscribed in clerical script.</p>
<p>Passengers of Dasheng Ship Landed</p>
<p>After being blocked at the mouth of the Oujiang River, the Dasheng ship, which was on a trial voyage to Wenzhou, was forced to sail to the waters of Zhoushan to anchor. Although the company's standing committee, which represents the ship, has made representations, the Japanese side's attitude is firm and has not released the ship. It has now been learned that the passengers on board the ship have landed in Dinghai and will take a ship to Ningbo from Dinghai, and then find a way to come to Shanghai. It is also learned that the Wenzhou authorities, after learning that the ship was detained at the mouth of the Oujiang River, have strictly prohibited ships from sailing rashly, and have telegraphed the Wenzhou Shanghai Association to inform shipping merchants that they will no longer send ships to Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Banks Have Clear Regulations on Interest Rate Cuts; Each Decides Based on Market Conditions; Minimum Amount Regulations Abolish Preferential System</h3>
<p>In view of the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai and the lack of normal investment avenues, each bank, in order to avoid sitting idly by and depleting interest and reducing the burden, has reduced interest rates and abolished preferential interest payment methods since the second half of the 30th year of the Republic, with reference to market conditions. However, it is not completely uniform. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank has reduced the interest on checking deposits to 2%. The New China Bank stipulates that no interest will be paid on daily balances below 500 yuan. It is heard that the interest on current deposits in each bank has been generally reduced to 4%, the interest on checking deposits has been reduced to 2%, and the interest on fixed deposits for one year is 7%. The method of adding 1% interest to daily balances of 500 yuan or more has been abolished. Deposits that are not collected after the expiration date will not be calculated outside the period. Continued deposits such as overdue consultations will generally not be supplemented for the original period. However, for fixed deposits where interest has been agreed with the depositor, the agreed interest rate will be calculated. If the deposit is continued after maturity, it will be calculated according to the new rate.</p>

<h3>A Horrific Bloodshed; A Constable Kills Without Blinking an Eye; Kills Three People Before Committing Suicide; Leaves His Post Without Permission and Breaks into Residences to Commit Murder; Shoots and Kills a Young Couple and a University Student; Three People Die One After Another; Bizarre Case</h3>
<p>In recent years, assassinations in Shanghai have emerged endlessly, but there has never been a case as bloody as yesterday's on Maybridge Road, where a Chinese constable shot and killed three people in succession, then committed suicide with a gun, also dying from serious injuries. It is truly horrifying. Although the reason for the case is still unclear afterward, it is generally speculated that it was a personal feud or involved a love affair. The detailed course of the case is recorded below:</p>
<p>Kills Her Husband and Then Shoots His Wife</p>
<p>At 11:50 AM yesterday, a Chinese constable named Huai, number 2100 from the Xinzha Police Station, who was on duty at the intersection of Maybridge Road and Jing'an Temple Road, left his post without permission and broke into the residence of Sun Jinyuan at No. 18, Lane 38, Maybridge Road. At that time, Sun was fast asleep in bed, dreaming sweetly, but Huai sneaked up to the bed, took out his service pistol, and fired four shots at Sun, all hitting his head, chest, and other parts of his body. He died instantly in bed. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, Huai put the gun away and fled.</p>
<p>Kills Her Husband and Then Shoots His Wife</p>
<p>When he fled to the door, he suddenly saw Sun's wife, Ms. Wang (24 years old), carrying a vegetable basket, returning from the market. He suddenly had the urge to kill again, and fired two shots at her. Ms. Wang was unable to dodge and was hit in the head and abdomen. She immediately fell to the ground, with blood splattering everywhere, barely alive. At this time, the constable had killed two people in succession. Although the residents of the house witnessed the murder, they were all silent and fled, and no one dared to call the police to capture the criminal.</p>
<p>Acts Like a Madman and Kills Qin Li</p>
<p>After shooting two people in succession, Huai seemed to be insane. At this time, Qin Li (24 years old), a native of Wuxi and a student at Jiangnan University, came slowly. The constable fired his pistol again and knocked him down. He was hit in the head with a single shot, and the bullet entered his brain. He died immediately from serious injuries, lying dead on the ground at the entrance of No. 18. Seeing that Qin had also died, the constable knew that he had shot and killed three people and could not escape punishment. He then had the idea of committing suicide. Because the bullets in the gun were used up, he took out a bullet magazine from his side, inserted it into the gun, and pointed the gun at his temple, firing two shots in succession.</p>
<p>Murderer Commits Suicide; Bizarre Case</p>
<p>After the bloody case occurred, the police station had also received the news and sent a large batch of detectives to rush to the scene, and summoned an ambulance to transport the three corpses of Sun, Qin, and Huai to the Baolong Hospital, and then to the morgue for examination. Ms. Wang was sent to the Baolong Hospital for treatment, and her injuries were very dangerous. It was learned afterward that the Sun couple had just married two months ago. Sun is 23 years old and is currently unemployed at home. The reason why he was killed is unknown. As for the deceased Qin Li, it is said that he went to Sun's house with the constable. After Sun was shot, he went out with the constable and was shot by the constable. Qin's home is at No. 641 Weihaiwei Road. What is the relationship between Huai, the constable, and Sun Jinyuan? Because the case is serious, the police station has ordered a strict investigation into the inside story of the case.</p>
<h3>Rongwu Society Will Lecture on Sutras Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Rongwu Society will lecture on sutras at 3:00 PM old time and 4:00 PM new time on the 6th, still at the Biler Hall on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Huanlong Road. Those who wish to listen may go on time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Request Exemption from Embargo on German Goods Ordered Before Severing Ties; Provide Certification by Guilds to Allow Transportation to the Mainland; German Merchants Plan to Change Route to Transport German Goods to China</h3>
<p>German trade with China has always occupied an important position. The transportation of German goods to China is dominated by dyes, pigments, paints, and varnishes, followed by chemical products and pharmaceuticals, and then by metal machinery, vehicles, and boats. China's native goods exported to Germany are dominated by animals and animal products and soybeans and peanuts.</p>
<p>There is Currently No Way to Transport German Goods to China</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, China's trade has gradually declined due to the interruption of waterway transport lines, falling from fourth place to fourteenth place. However, pigments and Western medicines, because they are essential items for China, are transported to Shanghai via the Siberian Railway, and then transferred from Shanghai to various mainland areas. Since the outbreak of the war between the Soviet Union and Germany, the transportation of German goods to China and Chinese goods to Germany has been completely suspended due to traffic disruption. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the pigment and Western medicine industry that there is a large number of German goods such as pigments and Western medicines in stock in Shanghai, so there is no immediate shortage. Large German firms such as Bayer, Qianxin, and Tianli have accumulated stocks, and firms dealing in pigments and Western medicines also hold huge amounts of stock. However, because the source of supply has been interrupted, hoarders are raising prices and refusing to sell, resulting in a further increase of 20% to 30%.</p>
<p>Yangon and Hong Kong Both Prohibit Transshipment</p>
<p>However, it is currently difficult to import German goods into free areas, because Yangon, Hong Kong, and other places prohibit the transshipment of German goods. It is said that since the Chinese government announced its severance of relations with Germany, various pigment and Western medicine merchants intend to request the government to certify the German goods purchased before and allow them to continue to be sold in China. All German goods that have been traded and contracted but have not yet arrived are also included, in order to benefit Chinese merchants. The trade associations of various industries are responsible for handling the certification procedures.</p>
<p>German Importers Plan New Route</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, German pharmaceuticals and pigments in this city soared in price due to panic over the source of supply. However, according to sources from German trading firms yesterday, German import traders are making every effort to find a way to transport goods. In the future, German goods may be transported via ports in Germany and Italy on shipping lines from countries such as France, Italy, and Japan to countries in South America, and then transported to Japan for transshipment to Shanghai. If this can be realized, the transportation time and cost will increase slightly compared to transporting goods via Siberia.</p>
<h3>Artillery Shell Discovered Near Sloping Bridge, and Two Hand Grenades</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, an artillery shell and two hand grenades were suddenly discovered near the Sloping Bridge on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. After someone reported it to the police station, detectives were dispatched to investigate and took the artillery shell and hand grenades to the police station. The police authorities are still investigating the source.</p>
<h3>Trolley Bus Fire Case; Culprit Sentenced; Ni Jikang Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>At about 3:00 PM on the afternoon of May 19, a fire suddenly broke out in the third-class carriage of the No. 16 trolley bus in the Public Concession. The ticket seller failed to open the iron gate in time and fled, causing more than 40 male and female passengers in the carriage to be burned to death, and 18 people who were injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. At that time, the cause of the fire could not be ascertained. After the Huishi Police Station's Chinese detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen and inspector Liang Yuliang investigated for a month, they received a confidential report that the perpetrator of the case was Ni Jikang, a Wuxi native who ran a Xinghua button shop at No. 87, Lane 87, Connaught Road. At that time, he was carrying 20 pounds of green celluloid buttons in a flour bag. A cigarette butt left over by a passenger fell on the bag, causing the fire. Ni took the opportunity to jump out of the window and fled, causing this disaster. He was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution for manslaughter under Article 276, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. After the defense concluded, the judge, Jiang Shuzi, presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Ni Jikang to five years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Restricts Electricity Consumption; Film Merchants Determined to Fight For It; Oppose Listing Cinemas as Luxury Class; Plan to Find a Way to Include Them in Industry Class</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Municipal Council previously established a committee to restrict electricity consumption in the concession and stipulated the restriction amount of electricity supply for various types of electricity users based on whether it was needed. At that time, cinemas were listed in the "luxury" class, and their electricity supply was in danger of being reduced by more than half.</p>
<p>Considered Discrimination</p>
<p>Each film distributor believed that the matter was of great importance to their business, so they sent a letter to the Municipal Council, expressing their opposition to this "discrimination plan." The Municipal Council then decided at a meeting on the 25th of last month to remove cinemas from the luxury class. It is now learned that the film distributors are still not satisfied with this and believe that the Municipal Council's electricity restriction plan is still discriminatory. Therefore, they plan to find a way to include cinemas in the "industry" class permanently. They will apply to the Municipal Council again, but it is not yet known, but those in charge say that the film merchants are continuing to work hard to ensure that cinemas receive a fair and equal electricity supply.</p>
<p>Significant Impact</p>
<p>The English-language Great Evening American also reports that the heads of the eight major American film distribution companies in this city met yesterday (the 3rd) to discuss the matter. The result of the discussion was that although the Municipal Council has removed cinemas from the luxury class, the electricity supply of each cinema is still in danger of being reduced by 70%. If this happens, each cinema will only be able to show one show a day, which will not be enough to cover expenses, and they will be forced to close down.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Zhou Zhongliang's Wife and Daughter Were Arrested by the Japanese Side. Japanese Knocked on the Door, the Gatekeeper Reported the Arrest. Police Arrived and Opened the Door, but Zhou Was Not Home.</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhongliang, who lived at No. 3 Baojian Road in the French Concession, was suddenly visited by plainclothes Japanese personnel accompanied by personnel from the French Police at his residence around 6:00 AM yesterday. The Japanese got out of the car and walked to the iron gate, knocking on it, intending to enter and arrest Zhou Zhongliang. However, the three gatekeepers employed by the Zhou residence glimpsed the Japanese knocking on the door through the gaps and, realizing the situation was dire, firmly refused to open the iron gate. They reported a robbery to the police station, which immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate. Only then did the Japanese personnel, together with the detectives, enter the house. Since Zhou Zhongliang was not at home, they could not arrest him. Instead, they arrested his wife and daughter, along with the three gatekeepers, and took them to Hongkou. The three gatekeepers were released by the Japanese side at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Vietnamese Constable Driving Away and Disappearing. The Car Has Been Found.</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 30th of last month, a Vietnamese constable, No. 730 of the French General Police Station, suddenly seized an opportunity to drive away a black-plated official car, No. 7011 (previous reports mistakenly stated he took a handgun). After the authorities discovered this, they notified all police stations to order patrol officers to pay attention to the search. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the car was found at 11:00 AM yesterday morning on Lincoln Road, an area outside the concession in western Shanghai. The police authorities in charge notified the French Police Station, who sent someone to drive the car back. However, the missing Vietnamese constable, No. 730, is still nowhere to be found and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested After Robbery</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 PM yesterday, a Tang-surnamed employee of the Gongda Rice Store on Route du Père Huc in the French Concession, carrying over 300 yuan in legal tender, was walking near the Yong'an Lane entrance on Yong'an Street when he was suddenly stopped by two armed robbers who snatched the money and attempted to flee. The employee shouted for help, and nearby Chinese constables, hearing the alarm, came to pursue and arrest the robbers. One robber, Zhou Er'a (from Shaoxing), was apprehended on the spot. A handgun, five bullets, and all the stolen money were found on him. He was taken to the police station for further processing.</p>

<h3>Liu Qingyi, Young Owner of Tianming Silk Factory, Kidnapped Yesterday. Abducted with Car on Way to Factory in the Morning. Had Previously Received Extortion Letter from Bandits.</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:45 AM yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred near Yanan Road and Connaught Road in western Shanghai. The victim was Liu Qingyi, a young owner of the Tianming Silk Factory at 53 Singapore Road, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, and 28 years old. His father, Liu Zhongkang (59 years old), operates the Tianming Silk Factory at 53 Singapore Road and also has a distribution office at 51 Zun Sui Lane, Xiamen Road. The father and son reside together at 39 Kang Village, Connaught Road. Liu Qingyi also works at the factory.</p>
<p>Every morning when going out, he would first go to the factory on Singapore Road for a round of inspection and then go to the distribution office to work. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, Liu got up, had breakfast, and, as usual, wearing a navy blue silk long gown, took car number 9575. As the car approached the intersection of Yanan Road and Connaught Road, not far from his residence, three kidnappers suddenly darted out. Two were wearing Western suits, and one was wearing short clothes. Simultaneously, two rickshaws blocked Liu's car, preventing it from moving forward. Then, the three kidnappers</p>
<p>each pulled out handguns and forced Liu's driver to start the engine and follow the kidnappers' car, a black-plated car with registration number 2030, which was parked by the roadside. When the kidnappers' car stopped near Yidingpan Road and Kainar Road, one of the kidnappers forced Liu's driver out of the car and then drove off, kidnapping Liu along with the car. The driver, Wei Guofeng, returned home and reported the incident, which was then reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by the Liu family, requesting an investigation. However, there was no news of his whereabouts by evening, and Liu's car was also not found. Reporters later learned that Liu Qingyi had previously received an extortion</p>
<p>letter from the bandits demanding 30,000 yuan. Liu neither sent someone to negotiate at the time nor reported it to the police, dismissing it with a laugh because he did not have much wealth. Unexpectedly, not long after, he was kidnapped. The police station is now ordering a full-scale rescue effort. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Liu is an ordinary employee of the Tianming Factory, his family is not wealthy, and the car he was riding in is a company car, not his own. It was completely unexpected that he would be targeted by bandits.</p>

<h3>Dr. Su Zufai Lectures on "Child Nutrition." Health Lecture by the Young Women's Christian Association.</h3>
<p>The second public lecture of the health series by the Young Women's Christian Association was held at 6:00 PM yesterday at the association's premises at 323 Muir Road. The association invited the famous female doctor Su Zufai to lecture on "Child Nutrition." She gave a detailed analysis of the nutrition of infant formula. She briefly stated that human milk is the most suitable nutrition for infants because (1) the protein and fat components contained in human milk can be matched with the needs of infants and are easily digested; (2) human milk is directly supplied to infants, and bacteria are difficult to mix in; and (3) human milk contains antitoxins that strengthen the resistance in infants' bodies. However, if the mother is suffering from a disease or for other reasons cannot provide milk as usual, she has no choice but to replace it with animal milk. According to experiments, goat's milk seems to be better than cow's milk. Its general composition is similar to cow's milk, but it contains more fat and is easier to digest than cow's milk. A friend living in Chongqing stated that because of the lack of cow's milk there and the high price, they fed goat's milk to their infant and the result was very satisfactory. However, the supply of goat's milk is very difficult, and it is generally rarely used. Usually, many people use cow's milk to replace human milk, but it should be noted that the source of cow's milk must be carefully examined. Milk from sick cows is extremely harmful. At the same time, if the infant's health is abnormal, the cow's milk used must first have its fat removed, commonly known as "skim milk." In large factories, the fat in cow's milk is extracted to make butter, reducing the fat in the milk from 3.5% to 0.01%. However, usually cow's milk is placed in the refrigerator for several hours to allow the fat to float to the top layer, and then it can be removed. Also, adding acid to cow's milk to make it easier to digest is also a good nutrient for unhealthy infants. A method is to pour cow's milk into a pot and slowly drip in a small amount of citric acid or lactic acid; for two pounds of cow's milk, five cubic centimeters of acidic liquid can be added. It must be completely integrated. In this way, even if the infant lacks stomach acid, it can be digested. Also, if neither goat's milk nor cow's milk is available, milk powder can be used instead. The KLIM brand is the best, and there is no big difference from fresh cow's milk, and its ingredients are very stable, and the chance of bacteria mixing in is also very small. As for the Niu Li Guo Da produced in New Zealand, its ingredients are also very good. According to statistics, the mortality rate of children is the lowest in the world in New Zealand. In addition, if the economy is not prosperous, soy milk can be used instead, although its protein is vegetable and fat is rare, but it is better than rice porridge as a substitute for milk, because rice only contains a large amount of starch. Also, most of those who came yesterday were women, and the situation was quite good. The next lecture is scheduled for the 8th, given by Dr. Shen Ji on "Birth Control Issues."</p>

<h3>Research Methods in History (1)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wujing</p>
<p>The countries that were civilized earliest in the world are: Egypt, India, Babylon, and China. China has had official historians since the Yellow Emperor. Although the Three Tombs, Five Classics, Eight Cables, and Nine Hills, the Chuan of Jin, the Wuwu of Chu, and the Spring and Autumn Annals of a Hundred Kingdoms, were not passed down after the burning of books by the Qin, the abundance of historical materials and the records of cultural relics are unparalleled in the world, and are truly worthy of our pride. However, the most famous, Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, was only for the emperor's perusal, so it exaggerated the facts of war, described the evolution of culture less, focused on the changes of dynasties, and neglected the evolution of society, exaggerating the teachings of sages and forgetting the contributions of the common people. By analogy with other histories, it can be generalized. No wonder the great historian H.G. Wells said, "Two hundred years ago, there was not a single book in the world worthy of being called history." This is not to say that there was no history, but that the people who compiled history in ancient and modern times had different concepts, so the previous books were not necessarily suitable for modern people's perusal, and the modern methods of studying history are also very different from the past, so there is a need to study history. I personally am not a history expert, but I have read extensively since childhood, and I have served as a professor. I will briefly describe what I know from my usual knowledge for your consideration.</p>
<p>(1) What is history?</p>
<p>Shuowen says, "History is the recorder of events, and it also holds the middle, which is justice." Justice is invisible, how can it be held in hand? Wu Dacheng said, "History is like a hand holding a bamboo slip." However, the shape of the middle and the bamboo slip are quite dissimilar. Jiang Yong believed that "the one on the right is the right hand, holding the taboo book with the hand." The meaning is already clearer. Wang Guowei said, "The middle is the container for holding bamboo slips... The meaning of the word 'history' is the person who holds the book... Holding the bamboo slip is the matter of history, precisely because holding the container is the matter of history. In ancient times, the books and bamboo slips were all in the charge of the historian..." From this point of view, history is the meaning of holding bamboo slips and recording events. This statement is most satisfactory. What is called history, according to Robinson's New History, is that "history is a broad-ranging study of mankind's past undertakings." This statement seems too broad. I think his definition is—</p>
<p>History is the study of the evolution of mankind, the development of society, and the phenomena of change and substitution of all things.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned word "evolution" is by no means vague. Try to prove it with historical events. Human life has evolved from hunting and gathering to agriculture and then to industry and commerce. Human tools have evolved from stone tools to bronze tools, then to iron tools, and then to electrical appliances. In terms of organization, from individuals to tribes, then to nations, and then to the great harmony of the world. In terms of politics, from theocracy to monarchy and then to democracy, there is no trace of evolution. This shows that the victory of history is not a family tree and genealogy of one person and one surname.</p>

<h3>Releasing Artificial Fog</h3>
<p>— Pan Li</p>
<p>It is said that in the current war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side has already released artificial fog. The effect of artificial fog can also be said to be a kind of psychological warfare on the battlefield. In addition to covering the advance of one's own troops, it makes the enemy's troops feel as if they have fallen into a fog, and within a few feet, they cannot distinguish their own faces, lose their way, and panic, thus losing all their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>It is not yet known how the German side's release of artificial fog will turn out; there are no detailed reports in the newspapers. However, we only need to look at the facts in recent years to know that Hitler is used to releasing artificial fog.</p>
<p>In this war between Germany and the Soviet Union, foreign journalists have no way to go to the front to collect news, and war news all relies on the official agencies of both sides to send it out. I destroyed thousands of your planes, and you destroyed hundreds of my tanks. It looks like something that is half-believed and half-doubted, like falling into a five-mile fog, and one can only guess at the development of the war in this five-mile fog.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the sudden signing of the non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union really exceeded the expectations of the world. This current German attack on the Soviet Union is even more confusing to the world. According to reports in the newspapers, even the people of the Soviet Union cannot help but be "speechless." This also shows Hitler's skill in releasing "artificial fog."</p>
<p>It is a clever move to release artificial fog against the enemy's troops on the battlefield, but if one wants to release artificial fog everywhere, and even make the people of one's own country fall into a black fog, obliterating the people's will, it will never have good results.</p>

<h3>The Generosity of Blood</h3>
<p>— Fei Zi</p>
<p>A new patient arrived at ward B.</p>
<p>After an X-ray diagnosis, it was discovered that her gastrointestinal junction had ruptured, and thus, her condition was officially diagnosed as a gastric ulcer.</p>
<p>Surgery was necessary.</p>
<p>The first step was to stop her from eating, emptying her stomach, and maintaining her nutrition with glucose.</p>
<p>Her complexion was as white as paper.</p>
<p>"If there's no blood supply, how can we perform the surgery?"</p>
<p>It wasn't just Doctor Liu who was worried; who wouldn't furrow their brow in sympathy?</p>
<p>Her family did their best, and under extremely high-priced conditions, they managed to persuade two laborers to 'try'.</p>
<p>As usual, we had to test their blood types first. As Miss Mu inserted the needle into the finger of one of them, he cried out "Aiyo!" and the other quickly slipped away. As a result, before even half a cc of blood was drawn, he asked to be 'exempted'!</p>
<p>We could only offer a wry smile at this farcical scene.</p>
<p>At the same time, the patient lying in bed seemed quite 'humane'. She insisted that she didn't want to do anything 'cruel' - taking someone else's blood to sustain her own life.</p>
<p>We could only smile wryly again.</p>
<p>"Blood! Don't think of it as such a 'treasure'! On the contrary, its value is revealed under the principle of 'giving'.</p>
<p>"Biological tissues are all metabolic. 'Stinginess with blood' won't add anything to you. A healthy person can donate 500cc of blood at a time without any reaction! At most, two or three days of rest, and the original blood volume will be restored, or even exceeded.</p>
<p>"In Europe and America, there are 'blood transfusion kings' and 'blood banks'. Everyone sees blood transfusion as a very honorable thing. From the perspective of human mutual aid, the supply of blood is the greatest thing!</p>
<p>"Conversely, we can 'take it easy' when receiving blood from others, with no cruelty and no violation of humanity! On the contrary, letting one's own life be lost in vain is cruel and inhumane!"</p>
<p>Doctor Liu's words liberated the patient in bed and the group surrounding the bedside!</p>
<p>Finally, her classmates - three modern young ladies - simultaneously volunteered to have their blood tested! Doctor Liu's words had paid off!</p>
<p>Fortunately! Their blood was also type A, the same as the patient.</p>
<p>We examined their physical condition, especially their hearts, and everything was fine! We dared to transfuse the blood.</p>
<p>After three rounds (given over three days) of transfusions, the patient's face suddenly lit up. She went from resembling gray autumn clouds to the morning glow of spring! There was a commotion in the ward, and every gaze was focused on the white bed - yes, she was still a beautiful woman!</p>
<p>The surgery was also performed and went very smoothly.</p>
<p>Two months later, she flew out of the hospital like a bird.</p>
<p>She thanked us and left her address, solemnly saying:</p>
<p>"If any patient needs blood, I can generously donate it."</p>
<p>Sincerely, willingly!</p>
<p>This determination is a new record for us.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the reborn New China, we need more people like this to practice the 'generosity' of blood!</p>
<p>There is no greater 'generosity' than this!</p>

<h3>Gambetta</h3>
<p>— Hou Fang</p>
<p>Napoleon's iron cavalry trampled across Prussia. Philosophy professor Fichte, witnessing the suffering, preached everywhere, stirring up the morals of the Prussian people. Then Bismarck unified Prussia, turning it into the Germany of today.</p>
<p>During the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck besieged Paris within days. French patriot Gambetta addressed the masses: "People of France! Never forget this day!" After finishing he left by balloon, eventually in World War I France took revenge.</p>
<p>Now there is World War II, is Germany taking revenge for World War I? Is there going to be a third or fourth…</p>
<p>I hope China has more people like Gambetta and Fichte.</p>
<h3>Words of Health</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>Health is an indispensable cornerstone for a fulfilling life. All the happiness in the family and the success in career are built on the soundness and vitality of the body.</p>
<p>Health must derive joy from the activity of life and the exercise of the body. At the same time, it also needs constant energy to undertake arduous work; only through active games and diligent work can anyone obtain a permanently satisfying life. — Charles W. Eliot</p>
<h3>Loquacity</h3>
<p>— Ming Wei</p>
<p>The length of life is not calculated by the number of years one lives, but by the things one encounters in those years. H. Ashton Wolfe</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>10. A Father's Heart</p>
<p>This time, Begonia was truly happy from the bottom of his heart! He was so happy that he even shed tears while smiling. Ever since he was plotted against by Ji Zhaoxiong in Tianjin ten years ago, today was the first time he had spontaneously smiled!</p>
<p>But because the teacher praised him so much, the first female student to discover Begonia couldn't help but turn her face away, looking out the window, leading several students to follow her.</p>
<p>"This is Wu Meiying's father! Why is he so poor and ugly, like a monster?" He seemed to hear the students inside saying this in a hallucination. His face flushed with embarrassment, and he hurriedly jumped from the corridor onto the playground. But he couldn't bear to go too far, stopping at a distance of three or four feet.</p>
<p>The heavy rain continued to fall, soaking his hair and his coat, but he didn't feel it at all. The umbrella was tucked at his waist, and he didn't even think about opening it.</p>
<p>"...That's why she always gets first place..." The teacher's voice seemed to still echo in his ears.</p>
<p>This was true! Since Mei Bao was sent to this small school at the age of seven, she had always been the top student in every semester, and she never missed a class and had good conduct. One award certificate after another, printed very poorly, almost covered one wall of Begonia's bedroom, giving him some comfort in an extremely depressed and difficult situation.</p>
<p>"I've decided to send her to middle school in the second half of the year!" He repeatedly calculated this in his heart.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old man, are you crazy? Standing in the heavy rain, why aren't you holding an umbrella?" The school worker came out from inside and shouted when he saw him. "Hurry up, come into the corridor! There are still twenty minutes until class is dismissed."</p>
<p>Hearing him shout this, Begonia began to realize that his clothes were completely soaked. (150)</p>
<p>Military Equipment</p>
<h3>Tank Reconnaissance Vehicle</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>During the recent European war, the German side produced many new weapons, one of which is the steel-armored reconnaissance vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a sturdy wireless radio aerial, which can not only resist damage from enemy artillery fire, but also clear obstacles at the time. This type of vehicle belongs to the German tank division and is used to reconnoiter enemy positions, troop concentrations, and mortar positions, and to transmit various messages to the tanks following behind at any time. It can be called a tank reconnaissance vehicle. In the recent German invasion of the Soviet Union, this type of tank reconnaissance was undoubtedly active on the front line again.</p>

<h3>Performers Create Benefits for Poor Children</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>This is good news:——The "Movie Star" team is going to play against the "Mighty Lions" team. The dates have been set for July 6th and July 13th, and the venue is the Shanghai Poor Children's Education and Training Institute. They will use the box office revenue, after deducting some necessary expenses, all for the fund of the institute, to cultivate poor children and create benefits for the country. This is very worthy of our appreciation.</p>
<p>The leader of the "Movie Star" team is Zhang Shankun. The lineup includes: Yin Xiucen as goalkeeper, Zhang Huichong as right back, Liu Qiong as left back, Wu Yonggang as center back, Wang Yin as center forward, and Han Langan on the right wing and Yue Feng on the left wing. According to Zhang Huichong, all the team members are very excited. "Fat Pig" and "Skinny Monkey" will each have amazing performances. A large number of movie stars will also be invited to form a "cheerleading squad" to cheer on the spot.</p>
<p>The lineup of the "Mighty Lions" is also very strong. The leader of the team is Ding Du, with Xiong Jie as goalkeeper, Pan Wuhai as right back, Tang Genfu as left back, Tang Zuowen as center back, Qian Zuzi as center forward, Wang Husheng on the right wing, and Pan Xin on the left wing.</p>
<p>Therefore, this competition is expected to be very lively, and it will be seen that all fans and movie fans in the city will be mobilized.</p>
<p>Finally, we can also report a message to the readers, that is, the director of the Poor Children's Institute, Guo Shouchun, and Chen Linsen, Zhang Huichong, Han Langan and other passionate comrades, will launch a joint performance of film and drama people. For example, Shi Hui, who plays Wen Tianxiang in "Song of Righteousness", Huang He, who plays Yue Fei in "Pavilion of Wind and Waves", Tang Ruoqing, who plays Ge Nenniang in "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty", Qiu Quan, who plays Zhou Fuxiang in "Gratitude and Hatred", Han Fei, who plays Liu Bowen in "The Biography of Heroes", Ying Zi, who plays Wu Feng in "Home", and movie stars such as Zhou Qi, Wang Yin, Mei Xi, Sun Min, Wang Xianqi, Lan Lan, Murong Wan'er, etc., all feel obliged to participate.</p>
<p>When this lineup is realized, it will naturally cause a sensation, because they are excellent actors in the drama and film circles, and they have never worked together or been on the same stage. When they meet the audience, they will show their artistic talents and acting skills, which will be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The institute currently has more than 280 students. In the past, they never solicited donations from outside. Now, due to the impact of rising living costs, they have to ask for help from all walks of life.</p>
<p>We hope that comrades standing on the art line, in such a harsh environment at this time and place, although they cannot directly serve the country, they should also indirectly do their best for the country, such as promoting good deeds, cultivating poor children, and collective donations, which are the work of everyone and the work on everyone's post.</p>
<p>We believe that today's children are the future masters of the country.</p>
<h3>Hu Rong's Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Tian Sheng</p>
<p>Suspension from School for Requesting Leave for the Sabbath</p>
<p>Famous child star Hu Rongrong, after announcing her retirement, devoted herself to studying hard. She has now transferred to the "Jinde Girls' Middle School Attached Elementary School" and has completed six years of elementary school. She will be promoted to junior high school for further studies next semester. However, recently, it was suddenly heard that Hu Rongrong was "transformed" and suspended from school for requesting leave to observe the "Sabbath". The truth has been found out: According to the Rongrong family's devout belief in Christianity, people inside and outside the film circle all know it. In the Chinese film industry, the Hu family is not the only one who believes in Christianity. Other stars such as Chen Yunshang are also religious families. Hu Die and Li Minghui, before their wedding night, both obeyed the beliefs of the man's family, were baptized and joined the church, and then they were able to sing and follow their husbands. However, the above-mentioned families are not as devout as the Hu Rongrong family. The school's educational affairs office, on the grounds that Rongrong's three siblings, due to the "Sabbath" relationship, ask for half a day off every Saturday, citing that it hinders school rules, announced that starting next semester, it will decline Hu Rongrong's siblings from continuing their studies, and refuse to accept seat fees and issue transfer certificates, but said that if they are willing to change the rules of observing the Sabbath, they will be allowed to study. After receiving the news, Rongrong's parents were very surprised, because this absence from class was due to religious beliefs and had been requested by the parents, which was by no means comparable to students being absent from class for no reason, so it did not involve school rules. They once asked the school authorities to withdraw their decision, but unfortunately it was not allowed. It is now heard that their parents are still making a second request, hoping that the school can "open a favor" and still follow the previous example without raising any objections. The result is still unknown.</p>
<p>It is reported that when Rongrong's sister was studying at Guangxia Middle School and Elementary School, she was also allowed to take leave for the Sabbath, because freedom of belief is a special privilege granted to the people by national law and should be respected. At the same time, Hu Rongrong's sister has always been ranked first in the past examinations, and her grades are better than those of ordinary students. Therefore, observing the Sabbath does not hinder her studies.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve As Ning Wu Can Only Do</p>
<p>His mother was over ninety years old, patted the table and laughed loudly: "Fortunately for my family, the father died for loyalty, the son died for filial piety, the wife died for chastity, and the mother died for righteousness", so she also committed suicide by slitting her throat. Loyalty, filial piety, chastity and righteousness, all came from one family, and are still recorded in the annals of history, forever immortal. If we can imitate the Bian Hu family, wouldn't that be great? Why do you miss me so much? Otherwise, you are an unfaithful and unfilial person, how can you see your ancestors underground? Zhou Yuji listened to his mother's words, and tears welled up in his eyes. He bowed down to his mother again and said: "Mother's golden words are earnestly taught, how dare I give up my life to repay the country?" Liu and his son were also wiping away tears beside him. Zhou Yuji bid farewell to his parents and wife, and went to the government office to sit down. Wang Weiguo came forward to see him. Zhou Yuji then issued a notice to the people, saying that all able-bodied men should come out to help defend the pass, and the rest of the old, weak, women and children could leave here to avoid the disaster. He also checked the food and military equipment in the pass, and was busy for half a day. In the evening, it was suddenly reported that Li Zicheng had sent an envoy to request an audience. Zhou Yuji summoned the man and saw the envoy sending a letter and several gifts. Zhou Yuji opened it and was furious. It turned out that Li Zicheng cherished Zhou Yuji's talent and specifically wrote a letter to persuade him to surrender, using euphemisms such as a good bird chooses a tree to perch on, and a virtuous minister chooses a master to serve, and tempted him with titles and salaries, and threatened him with military power. Zhou Yuji slapped the table and cursed loudly: "The thief Li is playing with soldiers in the pond, disturbing the Central Plains, and will surely be punished by heaven sooner or later. I, Zhou Yuji, am an extraordinary man and a great hero. Since ancient times, there have been generals who have been beheaded, but no generals who have surrendered, how can I be willing to surrender my heart to a thief? Tell him to come and eat my spear." After saying that, he tore the letter to pieces, ordered his subordinates to cut off the envoy's ears, and drove him out of the city. The envoy's ears were cut off, and he returned in a panic. Zhou Yuji also summoned Xu Jing, Zhang Lie, etc. to give them a lecture, saying to them: Li Zicheng has paid attention to me since this time he launched a large-scale attack. When he was in Daizhou, he sent assassins to assassinate me unsuccessfully. This time, he sent an envoy to write a letter to persuade me to surrender. I have torn up all the letters and cut off the envoy's ears and drove him back. Of course, I have angered that guy even more, and maybe he will come here to attack fiercely in the next few days. I have sworn to die to repay the country, and I will not be negligent in the face of difficulties. If Ning Wu loses, I will not be able to live any longer. I will live and die with the city, and I hope you will help me to kill the thieves with all your strength, and I will not let Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan monopolize the beauty first. Xu Jing, Wang Weiguo, etc. all expressed their willingness to obey the military orders and advance without retreat. (107)</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Liyuan Figures</h3>
<p>— Written by Nan Lu Bei Diao, Illustrated by Zhang Yuwozhang</p>
<p>(19) Yuan Shihai</p>
<p>Yuan Shihai is a famous Jing (painted face) actor of the fifth class of the Fu Lian Cheng Troupe. His family was in business. His father used to run the Yuan Ji carriage shop in the old capital. Shihai loved drama since he was a child. When he was twelve years old, his father sent him to the Fu Lian Cheng Troupe to learn acting, studying the patterned painted face. He is a heroic and martial man, with unrestrained stage steps, energetic recitations, and a majestic appearance. His performances have the magic of vivid depiction. He can perform many operas and is an outstanding painted face actor of the fifth class of the Fu Lian Cheng Troupe. The famous Jing actor Hao Shouchen loved his talent and was willing to accept him as a disciple. He formally held a apprenticeship ceremony in Beiping this spring. Hao taught him all the operas he was good at one by one. With Shihai's intelligence and love of learning, the person who will succeed Hao Shouchen in the future will undoubtedly be this child.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on "Wusheng" on Shanghai Stages (3)</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingchun</p>
<p>Mu Chunhua Mu Chunhua is also a strong general among the Wusheng actors on the Gong Stage, but limited to new plays, and with many Wusheng actors on the stage, he has not been able to fully display his talents; however, he is also quite supported by some audiences. He can perform many operas, and he is better at short play then in his armor, and his appearance is average and not annoying. The play "Luosiyu" is slightly better than Guo Chunhua's in the first Dan Gui Stage in the past. His skills are especially the most skilled in using the hammer weapon.</p>
<p>Wang Zhongchen The young Wusheng actor Wang Zhongchen is a new character who came with the Xu brothers. I have seen his "Picking Huache" and "Sijiecun" two scenes. I feel that short play is better than armor. His movements are agile and not chaotic, and everything is regular. In "Picking Huache", Gao Chong's appearance is not good, and when he holds the tiger-headed gold spear and clashes with Jin Wuzhu, he seems to be making a forced and artificial state, or some say that this can really show Gao Chong's bravery and spirit in those years, in line with the plot, but in the end it is too much. I hope that Wang Ling will correct this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Wang Fuying Fuying's art is a top-notch talent among the recent Wusheng actors, but it must be judged by whether he works hard or not. If he is in a good mood, the operas he performs are not inferior to the famous Wusheng actors. He is both smart and competitive, and his body is moderate and commensurate. He has sung in Tianchan for many years and has been very popular. I watched him and Gao (Xueqiao) Wang (Guiqing) perform "Changbanpo" together, dividing Zhao Yun, with Xue Youqin and Xie Wenqin's Mi and Gan, and Sun Junqing's Liu Bei, which is called a good play. However, among these three General Zilong, Fuying's appearance, posture and everything are the most outstanding. This is probably because there is comparison, so he did not dare to be careless. Now he belongs to Gengxin, and it is heard that the head of the stage relies on him very much.</p>
<p>Brief News The Jiliu Drama Club has recently launched a continuous performance in July. The plays that have been rehearsed and decided to be staged include "Meiluoxiang", "Sleepless City" and three one-act plays. In addition to the original five plays, the club has added a children's drama department and a music publication department.</p>
