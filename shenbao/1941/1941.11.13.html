<h3 id="c15">甘地對英態度 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>以戰時不列顚帝國全部的領域而論，印度實爲其心臟，德軍如果深入高加素，日軍如果進窺新加坡或緬甸，印度即成為英帝國作戰的根據地，其地位的重要性，正在與日俱增。顧印度對英態度如何，實唯甘地聖雄的馬首是瞻，茲將美國Look圖畫周報特派員與甘地的談話，譯錄如次：</p>
<p>訪員問：「聖雄你不贊成美國援助英國作戰麽？」</p>
<p>甘地答：「並非不贊成，因為美國不信我所主張的非暴力抵抗主義，」於是聖雄甘地繼續申說印度對於英國的要求如下：</p>
<p>印度對於英國唯一的要求，就是：印度有決定目己前途的權利。這種要求，只要英國肯承認印度合法選舉出來的國民大會所議決的議案，就可以實現。大會的議決案，也許是要完全獨立，但並無必然如此的理由。也許並不是完全獨立，或者，只是一種變相的獨立。或者，僅僅是自治領的地位。總之，印度一經決定，就可以同英國缔結盟約。至少，我自己是如此希望着；因為，印度　不是仇英，只是反對外族的統治罷了。</p>
<p>我們不希望英國民衆遭受任何損害，因為我們是把英國的民衆與英國政府的政策，分別淸楚的。我們並不希望英國民族在這次戰爭中失敗。他們的失敗，就是納粹的勝利，這是我們可決不願意的。</p>
<p>不論別人怎樣想，印度決不希望從央國的災禍中去取得獨立。有些人以為英國人自顧不暇，現在是遽到我們的目標最好的時機了。但是，他們不知道：利用敵人的弱點，趁火打刦，則是早晚自取敗亡的道路。</p>
<p>我雖然不能在戰事的進行上，同英國台作。但在它受納粹猛烈進攻的時期內，我決不願意同它為難，或加害于它。我們也不願意强迫英國政府接受我們的條件。我們願意感動它，使它贊同我們的見解。我們願意同英國締結平等而光榮的條約，我們不願意白白地獲得我們的獨立。</p>
<p>我　願印度為爭取獨立的緣故，無　期的從事于非暴力的　爭，不願它降低它的標準。它必須具有對於任何敵對勢力，能保衛其獨立的把握，纔能眞正享受和平之賜。</p>
<p>若干誠懇而有善意的英國人，至此不免發生疑問：你們眞能統治印度而不需我們的幫助麽，世界上不是有許多國家，如納粹的德國，會因着新印度共和國的困難，而毫不遲疑地來侵略麽？你們眞能使印度敎徒同回敎徒彼此和睦麽？你們眞能維持國內的秩序麼？或者你們想，英國應讓印度進入無統治的狀態，讓它去遭受內亂與外患呢？</p>
<p>這種誠懇英國人的意見，不信印度有防止內亂與外息的能力。其實是種不信任，是問題不能得到光榮解決的最大原因。</p>
<p>我不妨反問他們：如果印度國民大會，對於外國的侵略，自信無抵抗的及解除的能力，他們肯請英國撤退而自取滅亡麽？印度內部有多少弱點及缺憾，必須設法淸除，我是非常熟悉的，淸除的方法，只有一種，就是不打折扣的非暴力中義。他們必須絕對地拋棄暴力，對任何人不懐仇恨。我知道在西方有許多人，以為這種非暴力的生活，是不能做到的，我也承認，這種生活理想的實現，也許為期遙遠，也許我不能看見牠的實現，也許要等待幾世　能實現。</p>
<p>但是，這種理想，一經實現之後，一切內亂的根源，就完全除去。因為，內亂與非暴力，是勢不兩立的，兩者不能並容。</p>
<p>非暴力即使能產生內部的平安，難道也能保護印度，使無外患麽？我相信這是可能的。因為，非暴力主羲的眞正試騐，就是要從能否應付四週不重視此種主義的國家。</p>
<p>我甚至敢說；如果印度敎徒，回敎徙及其他民衆，不能推誠相見，猶如同胞手足，印度連自治也不配享受。因此，我們目前的努力，包括下列幾種目標：</p>
<p>印度敎徒與回敎徒團結</p>
<p>廢除賤民階級·</p>
<p>禁毒與禁酒·</p>
<p>農存紡織運動·</p>
<p>他種農村工業·</p>
<p>農村衛生·</p>
<p>新敎育（即基本敎育·）</p>
<p>成人敎育·</p>
<p>提高婦女地位·</p>
<p>衛生敎育·</p>
<p>統一國語運動·</p>
<p>提倡本國文字·</p>
<p>謀求經濟平等。、</p>
<p>以上各點，是我們工作的目標。我們的愉快，是在掙扎，努力，與艱難困苦裏，而不在勝利的本身。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c25">英國的斷然表示 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>三數月來的太平洋局勢，一向在極端不安中繼續演進，任何人憑着直覺的觀察，都會感到此一危機業已達到緊張的頂點，如再發展下去，無疑便是最後不幸一幕的爆發。唯其如此，所以近頃的各民治國當局對於未來遠東前途任何避免多做肯定的說明，而只是銳意從事於警戒和準備；這在一般人士，固然絕不置疑於英美應變的決心，但也未嘗不認為這種持重的沉默多少是一種遺憾，難免因為引起野心者的誤解且利用這一持重態度以進行其行險徼倖的打算，對於這，英相邱吉爾在倫敦市長就職席上的演說，恰好提供了一個明確的答覆</p>
<p>目前英國正面的敵人是納粹，但是這並不是以把英國對外政策重心拘囿於歐陸一隅，邱吉爾此度演說，無寗到是以遠束大局為其主要對象。本年八月廿四日邱氏對全世界的廣播，卽已申明英國遠東政策與美一致，如果美日談判無所成就，則英國當堅決站在美國方面，至於怎樣去合作應變，在這一次的演說已有補充的說明，表示了英國最後所準備的斷然步驟：「如美國果竟與日衝突，則英國在一小時內卽將繼美國而宣戰。」如此大聲鏜鏜，斬釘截鐵，不惟使投機取巧玩弄戰爭者將絕無施展技倆之餘地，亦且為全世界反抗侵略的國家平添無限勇　。已往民治國家的過分持重躲避戰爭，一向是侵略陣綫所利用的機會，引導歐戰爆發的慕尼黑會議固然是納粹以戰爭恫嚇民治國讓步的傑作，而三國同盟與南進企圖之類又何嘗不是針對着英美無力兼顧的弱點？現在英德仍在敵對，大西洋的威脅亦未减輕，但這些都不足以妨礙英美在必要時對遠東的斷然應付，英相在演說中曾鄭重申明：「吾人現覺力量充實，堪於需要時以力量强大之重海軍附以必要的輔助軍艦，服役於印度洋與太平洋中。」這絲毫沒有誇誕，德義殘餘海軍總和與大西洋的剽襲只、消英帝國海軍艦艇的一小部分已足應付，像喬治第五級的主力艦之類却現在正缺少着作戰的對象。更何祝美國以遠渡重洋作戰而編成的太平洋艦隊，包括着美國海軍主力的最大部分，更據美海長諾克斯隔昨對新聞記者的談話！到明年美國將有軍艦一百二十六艘可以出動，括有戰鬥級者三十五艘，而一二萬五千噸主力艦六艘之最後一艘亦將於明春二月完成，無論日本怎樣的故弄玄虛，把造艦程序秘而不宣，以其現有實力敵英美可能運用到太平洋和印度洋方面的海軍總和，這一成敗利鈍之數，是不難一言而決的。雖然美當局之於太平洋問題至今尙無將與英方駢肩作戰的明確表示，但英美也許至今猶復期望銳意擴展者能够相機止步，從大體形勢看來，民治列强在太平洋已經握有主動和必勝的地位。</p>
<p>目前日本特別議會卽將開會，而來栖特使猶留滯赴美中途，則日前所傳十五日的危機大槪暫可安然渡過，但却絕不容因此而鬆弛應有的警戒。日昨英相的演說，已經充分透示了美日發生衝突的可能性，至於來栖赴美使命及其所携方案，外間雖揣測多端，却沒有任何消息足以瞪明美日雙方立塲與見解有趨於一致的可能。尤其關於中國與蘇聯，美方頃已再提保證，表示美國決不在任何情形下改變其援助中國政府之政策以解決美日爭端，而日方之於蘇聯的東海濱和海參崴，也始終沒有足以使華盛頓方面釋念的表示；更何况有如日軍退出中國問題，越南半島安全問題，在在都存在着無數難關，殊難想像來栖竟能完成野村以及其若干前任所業已失敗了的使命。此一談判而再吿失敗，其前途固已在世人意像之中；如其竟能有所成就，則亦斷不容估量過高，至多不過把迫在眉睫的危機再事推延，俾日方得以期待更有利的時機與作戰準備的更加成熟。邱吉爾質直的表示，如果在三國締盟或歐戰發生以前，容或可能發生顯著的效果，至於今日，則有如鼎沸的遠東大局殆非僅僅英美昭示決心所克使之歸於寗靜，而行動則為比較任何言辭更有力有效的工具。</p>

<p>路透社十二日倫敦電今日國會重開、首相邱吉爾曾於下院辯論時、作三十八分鐘之演說、以答覆各項批評、謂政府內部並無變動之企圖、政府決使議會制度保留充分之活動、余常對於不時檢討戰局與軍略之種種不利、喚起注意、下院對此事亦頗予諒解、故今日恕不再作戰局之討論矣、余將避免對立即之將來作任何預測、回憶一月之前余曾提及希特勒之久不發言、此語似激動希特勒發表其預料莫斯科將於數日內　陷之演說、但就目前之事實而　、已可表示希特勒誠不如緘默之爲愈也（笑聲大　）、關於吾人對蘇聯之援助、如詳述之自將極富興趣、但以恐將秘密洩諸敝人、未便公布、余今可發殺者、爲若干海上戰事之消息、查截至七月爲止　之四個月內、吾人船隻之損失、略過二百萬噸、平均每月五十萬噸、而截至十月為止四個月之數、則减至七十五萬噸（歡呼聲）、平均每月祗十八萬噸矣、且益以捕自鄧方及美國讓予之船隻、故最近四個月內之純損失、尙不及上四個月之五分之一、此項事實應可增加吾人勝利之信念、並使吾人能希望在一九四二年美國偉大造船程序完成之前、照常維持吾人之海上運輸、倘使對付敵潛艇飛機之戰爭、將能繼續現狀，則余之私見、以為自由各國在一九四一三一年時，將可擁有大量船隻、能担任海外之軍事行動、英國目前之資源、確尙不能勝任、同時敵艦之被毀者、較前日見增多、截至十月止之四個月中、被擊沉或受重創之敵船、約近一百萬噸、地中海內敵方損失　巨、並有事實可證明、德·義對於接濟其在非州之軍隊、已極感困雞、最近敵護航隊被吾方完全殲滅事件、尤堪欣慰、綜上所述，使余相信德·義所發將於五月間佔領蘇彝士之狂言、至耶誕亦未能實踐也（笑聲大作）、至於國內之食料情形、現雖有種種限制、但仍敷吾人健康所需要、余希望吾人將能以肉類供給之大部份、給予工人、因彼等對之最為需要也、數月之前、吾人對燃煤情形似頗憂慮、惟至經商務及礦業兩大臣之努力、目下情形已較好轉、吾人之保煤、約較一年以前增多二三百高噸、故前途頗可樂觀、希特勒所作飢餓吾人以至屈服之勞力、必將失敗無疑矣、最後吾人必須作種種準備、以防來春氣候溫暖時敵人之進攻、吾人雖較六個月或一年之前增强不少、但同時敵人亦有充分時間、以作準備也、</p>

<p>進口商會研究行動</p>
<p>昨日下午二時、進口商及製造商組成之協會、在工部局召開特別緊急會議、檢討工部局統制食米價格後之物價情形、及硏究協會應採之平行行動、雖會議結果尙未由工部局疋式透露、但據消息難通之負責方面聲稱、進口商協會將於本週末或下週初、將管理屬於伙食公司與藥房所出售之物件、例如進口或就地製造之食物·調味品·除汚物料·藥品·紙烟·烟草·肥皂·以及飮料等等、至實施之方法、則由進口商協會評定所屬各物之最高價格、交由工部局執行、對於出售數量方面、進口商會亦將明白規定、飭令各零售商店一體遵守、</p>

<h3 id="c66">茶 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>一種東西，只耍是眞正為世人有利益的話，它決不局局促促的只在原產地供少數人的享用，而是一定要遠足遠行，利濟普世的。我現在就把這為我們每日滌煩解渴的茶，所以能逐漸普及到我國和全世界的經過，最簡單的撮述一下。</p>
<p>茶是屬於山茶科的一種常綠灌木，多少年來大家全承認是我國南部的原產。可是在十九世紀後半期，有幾個外國人在印度北部什麽喀沙兒（Caehard）山谷的，發現了幾株野生狀態的茶樹，於是遂狺狺爭辯起茶的祖國究竟是不是在印度來。我以為這只是好奇之過，故意作那翻案文章好聳人耳目的。你想我國南部和印度北部是那麼比鄰相望在同一地帶上，一定要說茶是原產在印度而不在我國，不是有些刻舟求劍了麼？况說只拿幾株野生狀態的茶樹，遂想喧賓奪主的把那自古以來的定案推翻，證據也太嫌薄弱：因為不但我國古籍對於茶樹的記載最早最詳，不但飮茶的習俗是從我國肇始，而且那野生狀態的茶樹，更是我國古書上所記錄的其多難以縷數的，這又怎樣去解釋呢？進一步說，就是現在在我國南部那人跡罕到的名山中，難道說就我不到這種不由人力栽培的茶樹麽？……閒言已多　，請微載籍。我國記載茶樹最古的書籍，除了神農本草係偽託不算外，便只有爾雅和詩經了。爾雅釋木篇「價苦荼」一語，註釋家以為：「樹小似梔子，冬生葉，可煮作羹飮。今呼早采者為茶，晚采者為茗……。」詩經邶風「誰謂荼苦，其甘如薺」一語，大多數的註釋家以為「荼」係苦菜，而蘇東坡則以為這也就是我們所吃的茶。一——荼和茶本係一字，漢朝後纔分而為二。——這樣說來，爾雅相傳是周公創作：假設註釋家沒有曲解了它的原文的話，是我國在公元前十二世紀已竟知道有茶這種植物了。退一步說，該書非周公所著，而為孔子門人所作，以釋六藝之言」如同近人所考信的，那它的年代也在公元前五六世紀哩。詩經年齡之遠在孔子以前，那更是盡人皆知的了。</p>
<p>假設有人嫌以上引證的辭句有點迷離恍惚不足憑信的話，好，我們現在看一篇證據確擊的東西，——王褒僅約，——而且這件事情的本身，說來也是非常滑稽好笑的。原來西漢文學家王褒，於漢宜帝神爵三年，公元前六一年『以事到煎上（今成都）寡婦楊惠舍。有一奴名便了，倩行酤酒。便了捍大杖……曰：「大夫——楊惠死去的丈夫，買便了時，只約守家，不約為他家男子酤酒！……你看這傢伙是多麽神氣，多麼倔强！不由王褒不勃然大怒，而要想法從楊惠手裏把這個寳貝買去，以便敎訓敎訓他了。可是便了怎麽樣呢？他悍然的說：「欲使，皆上券：不上券，便了不能為也！」王褒這纔把他日夜應作的事情，詳詳細細的給他開了一大篇賬當中有一句是客人來了要「炰鱉烹荼。」又有一句是「武陽（在今成都南）買茶。」註釋家把第一句「荼」字解作苦菜，把第——句「茶」字纔解作我們現在所吃的茶：我看第一句也似乎已竟就是我們所吃的茶了。無論怎樣吧，我國人飲茶這種習慣，是在這公元前六十一年，是在這西南方的四川，已竟頗為流行，却是有這鐵般的證據，而為任何人所不能否認的。</p>
<p>要算從三國吳志的韋曜傳上看，那吳國的皇帝孫皓：「每饗宴，無能否，率以七升為限。……　索飲酒不過三升……，當爲救减，或密賜「茶蔣以當酒。」是飮茶這種風氣，到了公元後三世紀中葉，已竟由偏僻的四川，逐漸傳播到長江下游一帶了，雖說道種傳播的路綫我們是沒有法子去追踪尋跡的。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c67">我愛梁專員的「老」法 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 曹爾蒼</p>
<p>看過了曹禺的「蛻變」，誰都會對這位垂垂老矣的梁專員起一種親切的感覺。是的，梁專員確是老了，但我覺得他老得可愛。</p>
<p>一般地說來，中國人大都是愛老的，例如貨物要揀老牌貨，人材要選老成者。自然，愛老的傾向，是趨善的表現，不可厚非。但是一味捧老，問題也就來了。所以這裏倒可加上一個註脚，那是老牌貨的名馳遐邇，並不由於牌子的新老，而由於它未老時的意絲不苟。老成者的得人信任，也並非由於年齡的老少，是由於先前的業蹟卓著。否則未老之先，即已身敗名裂，雖老亦有何用？</p>
<p>不過人類的老法，畢竟還有異於貨色的老。蓋以時間的殘酷，常把人類生命的旅程縮短。身為老年人者，旣不能對遙遙的未來，寄以熱烈的期望，於是看花賞月之餘，即以賣老著稱於時，一面慨嘆着世風的日下，一面又不滿於後生靑年的草率與無用，而他自己却掩蓋在「吾老矣」的大　下縮做一團。</p>
<p>自然這是可笑亦復可憐的老法，而老之不易，也就在這一點上。</p>
<p>臨筆至此，不禁想起兩位老者的隕落。其一是本年六月三十日逝世的波蘭政治家兼鋼琴聖手派特魯　基，另一是八月七日逝世的名震世界的印度詩哲泰戈爾。前者即使在亡國以後，尙在異國作本國難民的救濟工作，後者則直至臨死為止，無時無刻不在想完成理想國際和平的建立。而這樣的老人，在中國也未始沒有，有的從容入獄，萬里　　，若沈鈞儒先生；有的畢生盡瘁，致力敎育，若張伯苓先生。無疑的，這樣的老人，我們應以他們的精神與業蹟來判斷了！他們挾着純潔的操守，燦爛的已往，不太息，不賣老；而要緊的還是由於他們會抓住現實，不做時代的渣　。這樣，銀絲白髪，老態龍鍾，仍不失為是年少者的標記。</p>
<p>「你還年輕，我比你老吶！」是的梁專員確比　西堂老上六歲，然而從這詼諧的氛圍中，它帶來了一個喜訊：他沒有老呀！</p>
<p>我所愛的，就是這樣的老法。</p>

<h3 id="c68">赫德遜誕生百週年 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>英國作家兼鳥禽文學家赫德遜生於一八四一年八月四日，今年剛輪到誕生百週年。英國各報章都為文紀念這位一生為貧病所苦的文人。讓我們乘此良機把他的生平介紹如下：</p>
<p>赫德遜的雙親是美國人。他於離今一百年前生於南美阿根廷的京城，而於一九〇〇年當他定居於倫敦後才加入英國藉的。</p>
<p>從小時候就顯示對於鳥禽的愛好。在他二十九歲時離開南美駛英以前，他一有閒暇就在南美所特有的大草原上閒蕩。這期間所得的經騐對於他日後關於鳥禽文學的寫作是極有關係的。</p>
<p>赫德遜於一八八五年出版他的處女作「紫地」。（這是以烏拉奎為背景的一部愛情小說。）自從那時起，他一直在勤勉地寫作，可是直到二十多年後，他的一部最著名的作品「綠廈」發表后，他才逐漸開始為文壇注意。至一九一五年他的「綠廈」已被認為是一部文學名著，而著名英國作家高爾斯華綏尤其對於赫德遜表示嘆服在「綠廈」新版的序言中，他曾這樣地說：「在所有現存作家中！托爾斯泰旣經逝世！我最愛好的是赫德遜。」</p>
<p>赫德遜直到逝世前不久還在不斷地寫作　。他的最後一部作品「李區蒙公園的一個農僕」就是在他病床寫成，至死後才出版的。</p>
<p>批評家都認為他最得意的是當他描寫自然的時候，而他最失敗的是關於人物性格的刻畫。他自己也承認是自然文學作家而不是小說家。他對於自然家尤其是關於鳥禽的深刻之觀察曾使他產生好幾部極優秀的作品。例如「英國的鳥」，「倫敦的鳥」，「鳥與人」，「英國徒步記」等，在我們提倡生物小品的今日都極値得　以一讀的。</p>
<p>赫德遜的文體被認為是現代英國文學中最簡明最純粹的，他的作品常被採用作大學的文範就是這原故。著名英國作家康拉特曾說：「赫德遜的文字好比草的生長。它是極自然地生長在那裏。」</p>
<p>康拉特和赫德遜終身維持極友好的關係。兩人都向對方的作品表示敬意與欽佩</p>
<p>赫德遜有着極魁偉的體格。他在倫敦街上走着誰都不免回頭來看他。廣闊的雙肩加上六尺三寸長的體高，大頭上長着蓬鬆的頭髮，滿嘴短鬚和一副鷹樣的眼睛，他在任何集會中總是成為受人注目的對象。</p>
<p>勤勉的寫作並沒有使他獲得應有的金錢上之報酬。在沒沒無聞中他於一九二二年八月二日的夜半靜靜　死去，旣沒有經醫生的治療，也沒有售護士的看護。到第二天早晨才被人發見默默地躺在床上。享年八一一歲。</p>

<h3 id="c69">提倡步行運動 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 學範</p>
<p>處於這種牢籠般的環境下，尤其是活躍好動的劃時代靑年，他們不能施展其本能，不能發揮其個性，因此一般意氣稍弱的靑年不能　制苦悶的環境而陷落消極享樂的深淵，這是可怖的事實。</p>
<p>我們在此時此地來從事於「步行運動」，不惟在健康上有所得益，在精神的保持並發展上也正有一種很好的理解。靑年們從今天起，不妨振作起來試試看。</p>
<p>印度民族領袖，甘地在英留學的時期，他眞摯的吿訴我們：「步行運動的習慣是把散步和經濟合而為一，因為旣省了車錢，又得一天走八哩至十哩的路；這個長途散步的習慣，使我在全部留英期間，不曾生過一點毛病，還給了一個很美健的體格，但是，在可能範圍內，房間選擇是能於半點鐘內步行到辦公地方，為最妥善的辦法」。這一段是記載於其自傳中，我們是應該效法的。</p>
<p>英國商業領袖鮑　爾雖常備汽車，馬車數十輛，但其子女每天上學校，並不准許汽車接送，仍令其徒步往返。目睹島上擁資百萬富商的公子哥兒，隨時隨地是不能與汽車分離，好像道路上舖了荆棘似的寸步難行，聽到上述的叙述時，未免會感到內心的漸愧吧！</p>
<p>在多方面的透視之下，「一步行運動」的急宜推行與提倡，是急不容緩的，有一位醫師在「長壽之條件」裏也這樣說：「宜多在戶外作肉體的運動，或從事園藝，或從事競技，如二者不能可以散步代之。平時出外，宜少乘車，多步行，所費時間無多，旣可以代運動，而又不費分文。」</p>
<p>中國人的散步習慣並不講究到，——歪斜的姿勢，散漫的情緒，徘徊　躇，無所適從，在此時此地我們應有極大地決心來改革牠。我們要步行，務使姿勢雄壯，目光向前，一點也不畏縮。</p>
<p>實施步行運動該是最有意義和價値的他非但能鍜錬我們的身體，並能糾正我們的精神。</p>

<p>— 永運</p>
<p>平常我們只聽說有兩用沙發之類，現在更有了兩用書橱。即是白天是裝飾房間的書橱，晚上可以拉開來當床睡。在這寸金之地的都市裏，這種一物兩用的東西，便可以使市民獲益不少。我們希望上海也能看到這種一物數用的傢具。</p>
<h3 id="c71">秋海棠 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>今天秋海棠進來，他瞧那武管事的如此招待，心裏便起了誤會，還當秋海棠是那武管事的親戚或朋友，因此存心挑眼，而使秋海棠做了一個不知情的犧牲者。</p>
<p>不久，臺上打起鬧塲鼓了，後臺頓時忙亂起來</p>
<p>秋海棠便不住着笑，跟武行中的幾個同事敷衍着；在他總以為是很講得過去了，可是偷眼瞧那幾個人的臉，却個個都透着很冷淡的神氣，彷　對自己極不高興的樣子。</p>
<p>「道是什麽意思啊？」他一路穿衣抹彩，一路這樣　　着。</p>
<p>他想同事的感情是最要緊的，慢慢地必須設法聯絡。幸而聽武管事的說，這裏因為唱的是本戲，打武每天祗有一塲，不比唱老戲的館千裏，武行往往要出臺三四次，比較上想必總要省力許多</p>
<p>那知事實偏偏和他的理想相反。</p>
<p>大開打在北方的戲院子裏，祗有很少的　　武戲才用得到，平常的戲都不十分認眞；但在上海，這一幕却是大部分觀眾的趣味的集中點，無論那一本連環本戲，總得來上一塲大開打。所謂「開打　博」等等的形容詞，也往往在廣告裏登得非常的大。所以儘管每天祗打一塲，而在演出的時候，却總是特別認眞；主角配角，至少要打到三四十分鐘以上才能歇手，不然有許多客人是準會請求退票的。（二六一）</p>

<h3 id="c72">論黃桂秋私房新戲 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 炳麟</p>
<p>任何戲劇，演者難，編者尤難。凡有功於世道人心之戲，可稱上乘，否則任何佳構，皆為下品。近聞黄桂秋編演一蘆城俠侶」與「姜皇后」，不特簇簇嶄新，抑且能挽回末俗，力救澆風，可謂結晶極品，逈非尋常諸戲所及。接「蘆城俠侶」，劉太守殉難，風英被掳不屈，足見是忠：收屍哭想，足見是孝：不為馬亂，足見是節；救呂出難，足見是義。桂秋之飾鳳英，乃能於忠孝節義四字全副精神，曲曲傳出，誠非易事。忽而喬裝，忽而遁跡，尤足見活潑靈變之至。若論其扮男盜牌之時，能唱小生音調，可知學有淵源，由來已久。再論哭靈一齣，有二簧倒板，廻龍腔，大段反二簧，足徵桂秋善歌，並非虛譽。蓋桂秋之編是劇，不徒以一己工作見長，且能使生凈丑末，一齊登臺，各奏其技，包羅宏富，得未會有。</p>
<p>至於姜皇后一劇，桂秋飾姜后，雍容華貴，富麗堂皇，確是皇后身價，歷數妲己罪惡，直諫紂王失德，非惟口吻舉肖，而且描摹一種忠君愛國之熱忱，溢於言表，殊堪嘉尙·迨至身遭荼毒，仍不怨恨君王，是不失溫厚敦柔態度，寫盡姜后當日情形，可稱周到。總之桂秋編演兩　新戲，慘淡經營，煞費苦心，其挽救末俗澆漓之風，功不可沒，洵不愧上乘之戲也。（却酬）</p>

<p>卓氏新片繼「大獨裁者」之後，卓別麟又將拍攝一部新片，故事向「大國民」一片任編導及自演的奧遜韋爾士買來。照卓別麟的原意，本想請他任此片主角，但事後經雷電華方面全部工作人員表示反對，就此作罷。現在卓別麟已決計由他自演，祇是所演者並非要角，這便是和卓別麟過往的影片不同的一點。</p>
<p>嘉寳第二　女明星克斯泰夫蓀在好萊塢拍片，已有十六年的歷史，近來她的面貌，愈看愈像嘉寳，所以影迷都稱她「嘉寳第二」。她也是瑞典人，最近為米髙梅拍攝一部新片，有一幕戲裹，她穿着一襲浴衣。她雖然拍過十六年影片，但穿了浴衣上鏡頭，却還是破題兒第一遭呢！</p>
<p>美片重映　荷比法國等處，自淪陷後，對於好萊塢影片停映已久。所以美片的歐洲市塲，兩年來幾有停頓狀態。可是最近出乎意外，好萊塢各大影片公司，突然接到淪陷各國租映影片的定單，聞此舉已微得希特勒的同意。</p>
<p>歌星大忙好萊塢的電影明星，目前最忙的一個，怕是歌唱明星平考斯貝。早年，他在大學讀書時，專攻法柯，但在學校中，對於歌唱就特別髙興。後來和一個志同道合的朋友，組織歌舞班，在各地表演，並在電台播曲，才為好萊塢影片公司所賞識。而今他一面拍片，一面播音，忙得幾乎分身不開呢！</p>

<p>惟有柳隱英默默然不多談話，酒也喝得最少。許靖知道他一定為了去而復返，心上有些不髙興了，當着大家的面也不好和他怎樣說，所以許靖也沒有多喝酒。一會兒張蒼虬已喝得酩酊醉倒，陳飛付去了酒鈔，和許靖扶着張蒼虬送他回營。柴英別有事幹，吿別而去。柳隱英隨在許陳二人之後，送張蒼虬到了營中。看看天色已晚，二人也要回轉他們自己的營帳，所以跨着馬，在晚風夜色中踏月而歸。這晚上月色皎潔，照澈大地，道旁綠柳蓊鬱，遮蔽了月光。柳斷處，銀光耀目。遠遠地大山崔嵬，映着皓月，也好似披上了白甲素袍，許多頂天立地的大戰士，要為國家掃蕩妖魔。春風陣陣，吹拂到人臉上上來。許靖對着這當前的月景，心裹大有感觸。他和柳隱英並轡而行，偶瞧柳隱英低着頭，露出一團不髙興的樣子。馬蹄得得，打破了岑寂的空氣。許靖回頭對柳隱英帶笑說道：「前讀史記，韓信因漢王不用，悄悄離開蜀中，瀟何得知後，連忙把他追回來，請漢王重用，蕭何可謂有知人之明。現在我們走了，偏有柴英把我們追轉。我們雖料吳三桂不能成事，而因柴英的情誼，勉强回來，暫忍着以觀其後。但我看柳賢弟情緒大為不佳，諒必心中很不願意。我若沒有張大哥一言，也早和賢弟走了。（一二八）</p>

<p>United Press International, Washington, 12th: Reliable high-level sources here stated yesterday that the United States has assured Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih that Washington will not, under any circumstances, change its policy of aiding the Chinese government to resolve differences between the US and Japan.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 12th: British Indian Army Commander-in-Chief General Wavell stated to the Indian Council yesterday that during his recent travels in the Far East, he observed that the accommodations of Indian troops were indeed comfortable. During parliamentary questioning, when asked about the equipment and supplies for Indian troops fighting outside of India's borders, Finance Minister Jones replied that equipment lost or damaged by Indian troops in combat is immediately replenished. According to sources here, although General Wavell's trip was extremely brief, he made a short stop in Rangoon to discuss matters with the Burmese Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant Colonel McLeord. Wavell also inspected the Rangoon docks and saw a large amount of war materiel arriving steadily, the majority of which was being transshipped to China.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 12th: Republican Senator Taft of Ohio stated today that he learned that Japan had suggested to the United States that, in addition to stationing troops in five locations in China, it would be willing to completely withdraw its troops from all other areas of China, but was unwilling to guarantee not attacking Vladivostok. This condition failed to satisfy the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally stated that if Japan's peace proposals are genuinely seeking peace in the Pacific and are willing to treat the Chinese with respect, then President Roosevelt would certainly not reject them. The President is determined to maintain peace in the Pacific, but if Japan attempts to station troops in major Chinese cities, it would be tantamount to occupying China and holding China by the neck. He anticipates that the Pacific crisis may be resolved after Kurusu arrives in the United States.</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, Honolulu, 12th: The clipper plane carrying Kurusu across the Pacific remained stranded at Midway Island yesterday due to continued mechanical failures. Officials at Pan American Airlines here stated that the plane will take off on Wednesday.</p>
<p>United Press International, Honolulu, 12th: Mr. Weilyhan, director of Shanghai Weilyhan Company, and Mr. Ferlick, manager of Weilyhan Company, arrived here yesterday aboard a clipper plane, en route to Manila. Before leaving San Francisco, Weilyhan told reporters, "Washington officials are deeply impressed with intelligence on Far Eastern events and have made various preparations to cope with eventualities. Our policies have been declared by Secretary of State Hull and others, and the entire United States is united in unwavering support of these policies."</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th: Columbia Broadcasting System heard a report yesterday from Australian radio that, according to a member of the Dutch East Indies Economic Mission currently in Australia, "If Japan attacks Dutch or British Borneo to obtain oilfields, the world will witness the greatest conflagration in human history." The member stated, "Britain and the Netherlands are preparing, and in such circumstances, Japan should not dare to invade, so Japan is unlikely to commit such an unwise act."</p>
<p>United Press International, Bangkok, 12th: The official radio station in Bangkok issued a warning to the nation last night stating, "Thailand's entry into the war is inevitable. Most Thais do not express disagreement with this. The general mood here is not about whether war will happen or when; there are no signs of panic here, but the belief is that war is a fait accompli. Although the Thai army is weak, its determination to fight to the last man if Japanese troops cross the Thai border is extremely clear."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: The British Colonial Undersecretary stated in the House of Commons yesterday that there is currently no prospect of allowing British refugees forcibly evacuated from Hong Kong last year to return.</p>
<h3 id="e2">British Prime Minister's Declaration of War Speech: Japanese Press Claims Temporary Tolerance; American Press Says Warning Effective; German Statement Denies Peace Overtures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 12th: The Yomiuri Shimbun commented on Churchill's speech yesterday, stating, "We are currently tolerating all insults purely to await the maturity of our opportunities. Japan only responds to amicable gestures, but is prepared to resist pressure." It also stated, "Churchill, the chieftain of European warfare, is trying to drag the Pacific into war. Even if Japan were willing to take steps toward reconciliation with the United States, it would be seen as a sign of weakness."</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 12th: The New York Times editorialized yesterday, stating that Churchill's warning to Japan may be most effective in Tokyo, as it exposes the British naval power sufficient to offer strong assistance, which Japan has long doubted. Japan should not break out of the encirclement by the US, Britain, China, and the Netherlands, as this encirclement can be lifted when Japan ceases its warlike behavior and abandons its attempt to conquer all of East Asia. The newspaper also stated that if Japan is unwilling to do so, then Kurusu's trip to Washington will be futile.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 12th: The Washington Post criticized Churchill's speech, calling it timely. The newspaper continued, "Japan is unwilling to fight, but is forcefully trying to maintain its intimidating maneuvers, attempting to intimidate the anti-Axis powers. Japan's current situation has indeed become a ride on a tiger; only it can save itself." The newspaper further stated, "The aggressor nations have encountered a solid front."</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 12th: Senator Wheeler, a Montana Democrat, vehemently criticized British Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday. He stated, "If Churchill wants to help others, why not help the Soviet Union?" He also stated, "Why must we go to war with Japan? The reason is to help Britain, not America." He further stated, "My sympathy is absolutely beyond that of other people, but America must never go to war with any country because of sympathy for others."</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 12th: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's claims of German peace overtures, stating that this was a component used to stimulate British morale. It should be known that in this war, Germany will not make any peace overtures; Germany will fight until victory is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Far Eastern Interests Cannot Be Ignored; US and Japan at Decision Point; Making Urgent Preparations for Both Oceans; Exerting All Efforts to Create Just Peace; Secretary of the Navy Knox Delivers Speech in Rhode Island <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Providence, Rhode Island, 12th: Secretary of the Navy Knox attended the dedication ceremony of a new naval air base near the Rhode Island military base, and delivered a speech stating that the United States can no longer ignore Japan's actions to undermine American rights. For the past several years, the United States has made various efforts in the Far East aimed at maintaining peaceful relations with Japan, and has shown patience unprecedented in the history of international relations. We have cooperated with peace-loving and stable elements in Japan, and we are still prepared to cooperate with such elements. Although we have tolerated the repeated infringement of our rights, and although our supplies can be banned from export to Japan for reasons of our own defense, we have continued to allow these supplies to be shipped to Japan, because we feel it is necessary for the sake of peace. However, in the lives of individuals and in the lives of nations, there are periods when principles cannot be sacrificed and when vital rights cannot be repeatedly ignored. If we make further concessions at this time, our tolerance will be misunderstood. Our motives in the Pacific are the same as in the Atlantic, purely for reasons of self-defense.</p>
<p>United Press International, Providence, Rhode Island, 12th: Navy Undersecretary Knox stated yesterday that the time for decision between the United States and Japan has arrived. The grave dangers currently facing the United States cannot be overemphasized or overstated. There is a need to take extreme self-defense measures in the Atlantic, and the situation in the Pacific has moved to an alarming possible state. No one can say for sure how we will be tomorrow in this world. But only one thing is certain to us, which is that both the Pacific and the Atlantic require urgent defensive preparations. The safety of our country is extremely important. The interests of Europe and the Pacific have been threatened. Although we were victorious in the last world war, we lost the peace. The United States must exert all its efforts to create a just peace, not a retaliatory peace. Knox proposed four key points for a peace process: A world with political and economic power; Political autonomy should be aligned with economic integration; The free exchange of goods and the free acquisition of raw materials should be the cornerstones of the new world; The United States should assume a leading role in the world; Some kind of international order should be established so that all countries can act together against any aggressor.</p>
<p>United Press International, Providence, Rhode Island, 12th: Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters here yesterday that the U.S. Navy in both oceans will be deployed "earlier" than originally planned for completion in 1946. He stated that 126 warships will be available for deployment in 1941, including 35 battleships. Knox stated that the last of the six 35,000-ton superbattleships will be completed in January, and the first 45,000-ton battleship will be completed next year. However, news of this ship will be kept secret, as "we believe this is our best policy for fighting modern pirates for freedom of the seas. This is only one aspect of our efforts to undermine their morale." The Secretary also stated that the Panama Canal has the largest long-range artillery in the world.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: Today, newspapers here expressed outrage at the Armistice Day speeches of the US President, the US Secretary of the Navy, and the British Prime Minister, considering it strange that the three would simultaneously deliver similar provocative speeches. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Japan cannot ignore these anti-Japanese speeches. "We are currently making various peaceful efforts to prevent a world catastrophe from spreading to the final stage, but our country is also fully prepared to deal with any situation." The Nichi Nichi Shimbun also stated, "Judging from the remarks made by US Secretary of the Navy Knox that peace between the US and Japan has been lost, it should prove who is systematically pushing the US-Japan crisis." Japanese reactions to the US Secretary of the Navy's speech were first seen among officials in contact with the government, stating that it was unwise for the British Prime Minister and US Secretary of the Navy to compete in making provocative statements, given their positions. Japan has not taken any actions against the United States and has been extremely patient, sending Kurusu to the United States at the last minute in the hope of eliminating various difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The US Must Not Stand Idly By as Violence Destroys Civilization; Undersecretary of State Welles Declares Possible Entry into War at Any Moment <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 11th: Undersecretary of State Welles delivered a speech today after attending a memorial ceremony for former President Wilson, stating that the actions of Germany or Japan could involve the United States in the vortex of war at any time. The people of the country should not turn a deaf ear to the developments of the international situation, because if the United States can participate in international affairs with a wise attitude, it will not be difficult to establish greater security for the world. At a time when violence is trying to destroy the foundations of our civilization, the United States must not stand idly by. We have no doubt that freedom and democracy will ultimately prevail, but we cannot predict the duration of the war and how much hardship must be endured. We firmly believe that the future world organization must be based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 12th: Undersecretary of State Welles declared yesterday that the time for the United States to become involved in the war is not far off, and praised China, Britain, and the Soviet Union for their resistance to aggression.</p>
<p>United Press International, Camden, 12th: Lieutenant General Drum stated in a message during the First Army's exercises yesterday that the United States, in the face of crisis, can only save itself through force, and overwhelming force. He said, "We have all witnessed the rise of dictatorial challenges, threatening world peace, and finally driving the democratic countries into another world war. The United States is once again involved. Our freedom of action is once again threatened. The lives and property of the American people have been devastated. Any thoughtful man cannot hope that there will be no further sacrifices and that peace and order can be restored."</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, New York, 12th: Admiral Stirling delivered a speech in Kansas City last night, stating that the United States may occupy the Asor Islands, the Fante Cape Islands, the Canary Islands, Mazunik, and French West Africa, and that the US government will occupy foreign territories to keep the Atlantic sea lanes open.</p>
<p>United Press International, Oakland, California, 12th: Rear Admiral Greenslade, Commander of the 12th Naval District, urged the United States in a speech yesterday to impose a massive naval blockade if necessary, in order to secure the victory of the democratic nations. He stated, "If a blockade is our most powerful weapon against the Axis powers, then we must impose a blockade unprecedented in the world. A naval, land, and air blockade will form a steel wall against the enemy. We should unite with Britain, who is at war, to seize this encirclement of Nazi aggressors and force them to kneel down quickly, so that our losses can be minimized."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Special Cabinet Meeting to Be Held in Tokyo Today <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: The Japanese Cabinet will hold a special meeting tomorrow afternoon. According to the Japan News Agency, the speeches to be delivered by Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, and Finance Minister Kaya at the five-day extraordinary session of the Diet opening on Saturday will be decided and approved at this cabinet meeting. In addition, military and other supplementary budget proposals will be discussed.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 12th: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo held an informal meeting with representatives of the Upper House today and asked the representatives to cooperate with the government. Yesterday, Tojo made a similar speech to members of the Lower House. It is said that Japan is at a critical juncture of prosperity and decline, so he has requested the Emperor's approval to convene a plenary session of the Imperial Diet to discuss and finalize plans to complete Japan's national policy.</p>
<h3 id="e6">US Mission to Arrive in Tehran Soon; Iranian Prime Minister Meets with Reporters, Denies British and Soviet Interference in Internal Affairs <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, London, 12th: Reliable sources here state that the Soviet Union has urged Britain and the Soviet Union to immediately sign a treaty with Iran. A non-British diplomat recently reported from Tehran that most Soviet troops have left Iran for the Caucasus, but there have been no changes in the British and Soviet zones of Iran. The general impression here is that the defense of the Caucasus is proceeding well. The US mission is expected to arrive in Tehran in the near future.</p>
<p>TASS, Tehran, 12th: On the 7th, Iranian Prime Minister Foroughi gave a speech to Iranian reporters in Tehran, referring to the tripartite agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and Iran. He stated that the Iranian government had no intention of participating in this world war, and sincerely hoped to resolve various difficulties and disputes through peaceful means based on mutual understanding. The Iranian government's policy toward its two neighbors has always been based on a spirit of consistent cooperation. As people around the world are currently in a state of terror and crisis, and their governments have had to station troops in Iranian territory, relations between Iran and its neighbors (especially the Soviet and British governments) must be based on mutual understanding and consistency. The Prime Minister further pointed out that as a result of the discussions between the Soviet Union, Britain, and Iran, Iran has obtained results, and thanked the Soviet and British governments for their goodwill. Foroughi stated that the negotiations were based on the principles of freedom and independence for the people of the world and the declarations of Roosevelt and Churchill. Regarding rumors that the Soviet Union and Britain had insisted on the right to interfere in the country's political and military affairs in the proposal, the Prime Minister denied this. He stated that such requests were contrary to Iran's independence and its rights, and the Iranian government would never accept such demands. As for rumors that the Soviet Union and Britain had requested the conclusion of a military agreement, the use of Iranian troops to participate in Soviet and British military operations, and the mobilization of Iranian youth, the Prime Minister also denied this. Foroughi stated, "To avoid suspicion, I hereby declare that the Soviet Union and Britain have not made such requests to Iran. On this point, our government believes that our country's army must serve the interests of maintaining domestic security and national independence. Those who spread such rumors are acting for their own self-interest, trying to create unrest among the people in order to carry out their personal crimes." The Prime Minister concluded by pointing out that the authorities had no intention of calling up young people or changing the existing military service regulations.</p>
<p>TASS, Tehran, 12th: To commemorate the 24th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the Soviet Embassy held a concert in Tehran's largest theater, jointly celebrating the National Day with the Slavic people living there. Actors from the Tajik Theater performed on stage, and newsreels from the front and the film "Lenin in 1918" were screened. The concert was extremely successful. When the images of Lenin, Stalin, Voroshilov, and the Red Army appeared on the screen, the entire audience suddenly cheered. More than one thousand people participated.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Rumors of an Anglo-American Joint Fleet to Strengthen Far East Power <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Stockholm, 11th: London believes that Britain and the United States may establish a joint fleet in the Pacific. The London Daily Express stated that the British government's move to strengthen the defenses of the empire's forward bases was due to pressure from Washington. Hong Kong, which had always been considered unnecessary to defend, is now increasing its defenses at the request of the United States. A Stockholm newspaper's London correspondent reported this morning that Britain and the United States have reportedly reached an agreement to redistribute naval forces in the Far East, with the goal of forming an Anglo-American joint fleet, supplemented by Soviet submarines in Vladivostok, whose strength should exceed the Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, the London Times' Washington correspondent stated that Prime Minister Churchill guaranteed that if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, Britain will declare war on Japan within an hour, but the US government has not issued a corresponding statement. If the United States were to issue a declaration of this nature, it would certainly affect Japan's policies. The pressure that the United States is exerting on Japan is still increasing, accelerating aid to China, Britain, the Netherlands East Indies, and the Soviet Union, which is accelerating and completing the economic blockade of Japan.</p>

This report is purely fabricated from beginning to end, and is extremely foolish and unwise.</p>

<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 12th: British Minister of State in the Middle East, Richard Casey, said in a speech here today that the clouds of war were now threatening the Pacific, but that the situation was not comparable to 1939 and that Britain was prepared, hoping that that preparation would prevent war. "Australia has an unprecedented responsibility and risk," Casey said. "Prime Minister Churchill has told us that our great warships will steam toward this possible epicenter of disaster. Their arrival may prove to be effective."</p>

<p>Chongqing: Today, Chongqing is celebrating the Father of the Nation's birthday. The streets are filled with flags, and people going out for excursions and shopping fill the roads. Today, the sun is shining brightly, and Churchill's speech has rekindled a new spirit of optimism in all sectors of society, so the masses are ecstatic and joyful. Recently, due to the US-Japan negotiations and widespread rumors that the Japanese army was about to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road, the masses were worried. But this worry has now been greatly reduced. According to conversations on the streets, the Chinese people now believe that Britain and the United States will not allow China to engage in the future war alone to protect its lifeline. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Political Department Working Committee held a grand commemorative meeting at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall at 8:00 AM this morning to celebrate the Father of the Nation's birthday. Chairman Guo Moruo first gave an opening speech, which generally stated that the Republic of China exists today because of the Father of the Nation's birthday. The Father of the Nation is a great figure standing tall in thousands of years of history, and a savior for the 450 million people, so today, in commemorating the Father of the Nation, everyone should learn the Father of the Nation's great personality and spirit, and should conscientiously follow the Father of the Nation's teachings. After the Chairman's speech, Liang Hancao and Xu Baoju gave speeches. Liang said that the Father of the Nation has the great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage possessed by Confucius.

<p>The anticipation of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has been fulfilled; Anti-aggression countries will soon take the initiative against Japan. (At least on the Pacific psychological front, this is so.) This is the general reaction caused by Churchill's recent speech guaranteeing that Britain will immediately declare war on Japan if war breaks out between the US and Japan, and by the recent official statements from China, Britain, and the United States. Chinese officials are confident that if Japan attacks the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain and the United States will implement their warnings to Japan. Foreign experts who have lived in China for a long time believe that Japan's only hope of successfully invading Kunming via southern Yunnan Province is to achieve absolute control of the skies. However, the Chinese side pointed out that the Royal Air Force has been rapidly increasing its concentration in Malaya and Burma, and Burma has also announced the construction of multiple military airfields on the border. In addition, there are American volunteer pilots in Burma who will come to China immediately. Therefore, Chinese military officials are confident that Japan will not be able to obtain the necessary complete control of the skies if it attacks the Yunnan-Burma Road. At the same time, the Chinese side also stated that if Japan directly invades Burma from the west via Vietnam and the northern end of Thailand, China is also prepared to fulfill its full responsibility to participate in the ABCD defense of the Yunnan-Burma Road.

<h3 id="e12">Speech by the British Prime Minister Welcomed by All Parties; Britain's Determination to Deal with the Far Eastern Situation is Tantamount to Issuing a Final Warning to Japan <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, the wartime capital, various newspapers on the 12th commented on the British Prime Minister's speech, praising his firm attitude towards aiding the United States and fighting against Japan.</p>
<p>The Central Daily News stated that Prime Minister Churchill's speech was, in effect, a final warning to Japan. His wording and phrasing were truly decisive and exceptionally forthright. It is deeply believed that people worldwide, upon hearing the British Prime Minister's speech, will have profound reflections. Going forward, the United States will never again appease Japan. The Prime Minister's every word undoubtedly represents the British government. It is feared that during the Atlantic Charter talks, such an understanding was already reached and such a policy decided. The current strength of the United States and Britain is sufficient to cope with wars on both oceans. In the event of a conflict between the United States and Japan, (ABCD) will naturally cooperate thoroughly to jointly resolve the issue of Japan. The system of maintaining peace and collective security after the war should be comprehensively planned and a concentrated counter-offensive launched today. And the most important thing for comprehensive planning and a concentrated counter-offensive today is "to first resolve the issue of Japan." (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Newspapers here in Hong Kong have all published Prime Minister Churchill's speech in prominent positions. Chinese observers unanimously believe that Churchill's speech demonstrates Britain's firm determination to deal with the Far Eastern situation. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The speech delivered by British Prime Minister Churchill at the annual banquet of the Lord Mayor of London has been widely welcomed in the wartime capital. In particular, the section of his speech stating, "The British side has made various preparations to defend Britain's Far Eastern interests, which are currently in danger, and our common principles," is viewed by authoritative sources in the wartime capital as a reaffirmation of the solid unity between the British government and other countries invaded in the Pacific. A year ago, when the Burma Road was reopened, Prime Minister Churchill made a statement in the British House of Commons. This speech, however, represents a further and more resolute expression of the British government's position. Prime Minister Churchill is a man of action. If he speaks without preparation or cannot put his words into practice, he would rather remain silent. It is deeply believed here that any reckless actions by Japan hereafter will inevitably strengthen the anti-aggression front. (11th Dispatch)</p>

Overseas Chinese leader Situ Meitang of the United States, recently appointed as an advisor to the Executive Yuan, departed from New York on October 11 to return to China. He is scheduled to board the President Harrison in San Francisco on October 17 to return east. He is expected to stay in Hong Kong for three weeks before flying to Chongqing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and assume his duties. Mr. Situ is currently 75 years old but remains in excellent spirits. He is truly a respected elder in the overseas Chinese community, known for his benevolence, generosity, and courage. Any undertaking beneficial to the overseas Chinese community, once promoted by him, receives universal support and is quickly accomplished. During the war of resistance, he took the lead in organizing the All-Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association. For the past four years, thanks to his efforts and leadership, overseas Chinese compatriots have enthusiastically donated funds. To date, fundraising in New York alone has reached over 40 million yuan in national currency, which is undoubtedly due to his effective leadership. Mr. Situ's ancestral home is in Guangdong. He came to the United States to do business in the fourth year of the Republic and has served as the president of the American Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the director of the American Hongmen Zhi Gong General Hall, among other positions.

<h3 id="e15">Gandhi's Attitude Towards Britain <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Considering the entire territory of the British Empire during wartime, India is truly its heart. If German forces penetrate the Caucasus and Japanese forces advance on Singapore or Burma, India will become the base of operations for the British Empire. Its importance is steadily increasing. However, India's attitude towards Britain is solely dictated by Mahatma Gandhi. The following is a translation of an interview between a special correspondent of the American "Look" magazine and Gandhi:</p>
<p>Interviewer: "Mahatma, do you not approve of the United States assisting Britain in the war?"</p>
<p>Gandhi: "It is not that I do not approve, but the United States does not believe in the non-violent resistance I advocate." Then, Mahatma Gandhi continued to state India's demands to Britain as follows:</p>
<p>India's only demand to Britain is that India has the right to determine its own future. This demand can be realized as long as Britain recognizes the resolutions passed by the National Congress, which is legally elected by India. The resolutions of the Congress may be for complete independence, but there is no necessary reason for this to be the case. Perhaps it is not complete independence, or perhaps it is a form of disguised independence. Or, it may simply be the status of a dominion. In short, once India has decided, it can conclude a treaty with Britain. At least, that is what I myself hope for; because India is not anti-British, but only opposes foreign rule.</p>
<p>We do not wish the British people to suffer any harm, because we clearly distinguish between the British people and the policies of the British government. We do not wish the British nation to fail in this war. Their failure would be the victory of the Nazis, which we absolutely do not want.</p>
<p>No matter what others may think, India will never seek independence from Britain's misfortunes. Some people think that since the British are preoccupied with their own affairs, now is the best time to achieve our goal. However, they do not know that exploiting the enemy's weaknesses and taking advantage of their difficulties is a path to self-destruction sooner or later.</p>
<p>Although I cannot cooperate with Britain in the conduct of the war, I am unwilling to make things difficult for it or harm it during the period when it is under fierce attack by the Nazis. We also do not want to force the British government to accept our conditions. We want to move it, to make it agree with our views. We want to conclude a treaty with Britain that is equal and honorable. We do not want to obtain our independence for nothing.</p>
<p>I wish India to engage in non-violent struggle for an indefinite period for the sake of winning independence. I do not want it to lower its standards. It must have the confidence to defend its independence against any hostile forces in order to truly enjoy the blessings of peace.</p>
<p>Some sincere and well-intentioned British people cannot help but ask: Can you truly govern India without our help? Are there not many countries in the world, such as Nazi Germany, that would not hesitate to invade because of the difficulties of the new Indian republic? Can you truly make Hindus and Muslims live in harmony with each other? Can you truly maintain order within the country? Or do you think that Britain should let India enter a state of anarchy, allowing it to suffer from internal strife and external troubles?</p>
<p>This view of sincere British people does not believe that India has the ability to prevent internal strife and external troubles. In fact, this is a kind of distrust, which is the biggest reason why the problem cannot be gloriously resolved.</p>
<p>I might as well ask them in return: If the Indian National Congress is not confident in its ability to resist and eliminate foreign aggression, would they be willing to ask Britain to withdraw and court their own destruction? I am very familiar with how many weaknesses and shortcomings there are within India that must be eliminated. There is only one way to eliminate them, and that is uncompromising non-violence. They must absolutely abandon violence and harbor no hatred towards anyone. I know that there are many people in the West who think that this kind of non-violent life is impossible to achieve. I also admit that the realization of this ideal may be far away. Perhaps I will not see its realization. Perhaps it will take several generations to realize it.</p>
<p>However, once this ideal is realized, all the roots of internal strife will be completely removed. Because internal strife and non-violence are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist.</p>
<p>Even if non-violence can produce internal peace, can it also protect India from external troubles? I believe this is possible. Because the true test of non-violence is whether it can cope with countries around it that do not value this doctrine.</p>
<p>I would even dare to say that if Hindus, Muslims, and other people cannot treat each other with sincerity, as fellow compatriots, India is not worthy of even enjoying autonomy. Therefore, our current efforts include the following goals:</p>
<p>Hindu-Muslim unity</p>
<p>Abolition of the caste system</p>
<p>Prohibition of drugs and alcohol</p>
<p>Rural spinning and weaving movement</p>
<p>Other rural industries</p>
<p>Rural sanitation</p>
<p>New education (i.e., basic education)</p>
<p>Adult education</p>
<p>Raising the status of women</p>
<p>Health education</p>
<p>Unification of the national language movement</p>
<p>Promoting the native language</p>
<p>Seeking economic equality</p>
<p>The above points are the goals of our work. Our joy lies in the struggle, the effort, and the hardships, and not in the victory itself.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Britain's Resolute Expression <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>For the past few months, the situation in the Pacific has been evolving in extreme instability. Anyone with an intuitive observation would feel that this crisis has reached a tense climax, and any further development would undoubtedly lead to the outbreak of the final, unfortunate act. Precisely because of this, the authorities of various democratic countries have recently avoided making any definite statements about the future of the Far East, and have instead been focused on vigilance and preparation. To the general public, this certainly does not cast doubt on the determination of Britain and the United States to respond to the situation, but it cannot be denied that this cautious silence is somewhat regrettable, inevitably leading to misunderstandings by those with ambitions and allowing them to take advantage of this cautious attitude to carry out their risky and opportunistic plans. In this regard, Prime Minister Churchill's speech at the inauguration of the Lord Mayor of London provides a clear answer.</p>
<p>Britain's current direct enemy is the Nazis, but this does not mean that Britain's foreign policy is confined to a corner of Europe. Churchill's speech this time seems to have the overall situation in the Far East as its main focus. On August 24th of this year, Churchill's broadcast to the world already stated that Britain's Far Eastern policy is consistent with that of the United States, and if the U.S.-Japan negotiations are unsuccessful, Britain will firmly stand on the side of the United States. As for how to cooperate and respond to the situation, this speech has supplemented that explanation, expressing the final and decisive steps that Britain is prepared to take: "If the United States is indeed in conflict with Japan, Britain will declare war on Japan within an hour of the United States." Such a loud, clear, and decisive statement not only leaves no room for those who speculate and manipulate war to use their tricks, but also adds unlimited courage to countries around the world that resist aggression. In the past, the excessive caution of democratic countries in avoiding war has always been an opportunity exploited by the aggression front. The Munich Conference, which led to the outbreak of the European war, was undoubtedly a masterpiece of the Nazis using war to intimidate democratic countries into making concessions, and the Tripartite Pact and the Southern Advance Plan were also aimed at the weakness of Britain and the United States' inability to take care of both. Now, Britain and Germany are still at odds, and the threat in the Atlantic has not lessened, but these are not enough to prevent Britain and the United States from decisively responding to the Far East when necessary. The Prime Minister solemnly stated in his speech: "We now feel that we have sufficient strength to deploy a powerful naval force with the necessary auxiliary warships to the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean when needed." This is not an exaggeration. The combined remaining naval forces of Germany and Italy and the piracy in the Atlantic can be handled by only a small portion of the British Imperial Navy, while battleships like the King George V class are currently lacking a target to fight. What is more, the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which was formed by the United States for long-distance operations, includes the largest part of the U.S. Navy's main force. According to U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox's conversation with reporters yesterday, by next year, the United States will have 126 warships that can be deployed, including 35 battle-class ships, and the last of the six 12,500-ton battleships will also be completed in February of next spring. No matter how Japan mystifies and keeps its shipbuilding program secret, it is not difficult to say in one word whether its existing strength can match the sum of the naval forces that Britain and the United States can deploy to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Although the U.S. authorities have not yet made a clear statement about fighting alongside Britain on the Pacific issue, Britain and the United States may still hope that those who are determined to expand will be able to stop in time. From the overall situation, the democratic powers have already grasped the initiative and the position of sure victory in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Japanese special parliament is about to convene, and Special Envoy Kurusu is still en route to the United States, so the crisis of the 15th, which was rumored a few days ago, can probably be safely overcome for the time being, but there is absolutely no room for complacency. The British Prime Minister's speech yesterday has fully revealed the possibility of a conflict between the United States and Japan. As for the mission of Kurusu's visit to the United States and the plan he is carrying, although there are many speculations from the outside world, there is no news that can prove that the positions and views of the United States and Japan are tending to converge. Especially with regard to China and the Soviet Union, the U.S. side has recently reiterated its guarantee, expressing that the United States will not change its policy of assisting the Chinese government in any circumstances in order to resolve the U.S.-Japan dispute, and the Japanese side has never made any statements regarding the Sea of Japan and Vladivostok that can relieve Washington's concerns. What's more, there are countless difficulties with issues such as the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and the security of the Indochinese Peninsula. It is difficult to imagine that Kurusu can complete the mission that Nomura and his many predecessors have already failed. The prospect of this negotiation failing again is already in the imagination of the world. If it can indeed achieve something, it should not be overestimated. At most, it will only postpone the imminent crisis again, so that the Japanese side can look forward to more favorable opportunities and more mature war preparations. Churchill's straightforward expression may have had a significant effect if it had occurred before the formation of the Tripartite Alliance or the outbreak of the European War. As of today, however, the boiling situation in the Far East cannot be calmed down merely by Britain and the United States declaring their determination, and action is a more powerful and effective tool than any words.</p>
<h3 id="e26">London Parliament Reopens; British King Delivers Speech; Declares Utmost Effort to Aid Soviet Union; No Changes within the Government <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – The British King delivered a speech at the opening of Parliament today, stating that the British government, in consultation with the governments of the Allied nations and with the goodwill of the American government, is considering the pressing issues that various countries currently suffering under tyrannical oppression will face when they regain their freedom. The King also expressed his belief that the nation will wholeheartedly respond to the immense needs placed upon them, providing the army with the tools for victory and offering all possible aid to the Soviet Union's heroic resistance.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – At the reopening of Parliament today, Prime Minister Churchill delivered a thirty-eight-minute speech in the House of Commons, responding to various criticisms. He stated that there is no intention to change the composition of the government and that the government is determined to maintain the full activity of the parliamentary system. He frequently draws attention to the various disadvantages of constantly reviewing the war situation and military strategies, which the House of Commons largely understands. Therefore, he will refrain from discussing the war situation today. He will avoid making any predictions about the immediate future. Recalling that a month ago, he mentioned Hitler's prolonged silence, which seemed to provoke Hitler into delivering a speech predicting that Moscow would fall within a few days. However, based on the current facts, it can be said that Hitler would have been better off remaining silent (loud laughter). Regarding our aid to the Soviet Union, detailing it would be of great interest, but for fear of revealing secrets to the enemy, it is not appropriate to make it public. Today, I can release news of some naval battles. In the four months ending in July, our ship losses slightly exceeded two million tons, averaging 500,000 tons per month. However, in the four months ending in October, this number has decreased to 750,000 tons (cheers), averaging only 180,000 tons per month. Furthermore, with the addition of ships captured from the Axis powers and those granted by the United States, the net losses in the last four months are less than one-fifth of those in the previous four months. This fact should increase our confidence in victory and enable us to hope that our maritime transport will be maintained as usual before the completion of the great American shipbuilding program in 1942. If the war against enemy submarines and aircraft continues as it is, it is my personal opinion that the free nations will possess a large number of ships by 1943, capable of undertaking overseas military operations, something that Britain's current resources are certainly not sufficient for. At the same time, the number of enemy ships destroyed is increasing daily. In the four months ending in October, nearly one million tons of enemy ships have been sunk or severely damaged. The enemy has suffered huge losses in the Mediterranean, and there is evidence to prove that Germany and Italy are experiencing extreme difficulties in supplying their troops in Africa. The recent complete annihilation of an enemy convoy by our forces is particularly gratifying. In summary, this leads me to believe that the Germans' and Italians' wild claims that they would occupy the Suez Canal by May will not be fulfilled even by Christmas (loud laughter). As for the domestic food situation, although there are various restrictions, it is still sufficient for our health needs. I hope that we will be able to give the majority of the meat supply to the workers, as they need it most. A few months ago, we seemed quite worried about the coal situation, but thanks to the efforts of the Ministers of Commerce and Mines, the situation has improved. Our coal reserves are approximately two to three hundred tons greater than a year ago, so the future is quite promising. Hitler's efforts to starve us into submission will undoubtedly fail. Finally, we must make various preparations to prevent enemy attacks when the weather warms up next spring. Although we are much stronger than we were six months or a year ago, the enemy has also had ample time to prepare.</p>

<p>Havas Agency, Helsinki, 11th – Prime Minister Rangell convened a closed-door meeting of both houses of Parliament at 9:00 PM today to read aloud the reply to the U.S. note.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Helsinki, 12th – The American Minister to Finland, Schoenfeld, submitted two memoranda from the U.S. government to Finnish President Ryti on October 27th and October 30th, respectively. Finland's reply was released this morning. The document was personally delivered by Finnish Foreign Minister Witting to the American Minister to Finland. In its reply, the Finnish government refuses to agree to cease current military operations. Finland will continue to fight until Finland's security can be guaranteed. Finland, bordering the Soviet Union, has no choice but to continue taking self-defensive actions against Soviet aggression. Finland can hardly preserve its sovereign integrity unless it personally secures its border. The nature of Finland's combat will not change even though its troops have crossed the 1939 border and occupied enemy territory. Finland will immediately cease fighting once the threat it faces has been eliminated and permanent security is guaranteed. No one has suggested peace to Finland, nor has anyone suggested mediation. Yet the United States wishes to use its rhetoric to make Finland beg for peace. Furthermore, the U.S. government claims that Finland's military actions threaten the security of the Americas. The Finnish government cannot agree with this point either. Finland firmly believes that even a small nation should have the right to exist and defend itself. Therefore, Finland will continue to fight and will not stop until it obtains a firm guarantee of peace and security. At the same time, it will not agree to any attempts to undermine Finland's combat efforts.</p>

<p>Haitong Agency, Rome, 12th – Communist elements in the Italian army caused a bombing incident during a parade in Spalato.

After the incident, the authorities immediately began an investigation and arrested 150 suspects, most of whom were communists. These suspects were held as hostages pending the investigation of the case. They will be tried by a special court of the Ministry of Defense.</p>

<p>TASS, Kuybyshev, 12th – Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau, Lozovsky, told foreign reporters today that the situation near Moscow has improved in the past week. The German advance has been halted, and the Red Army has launched a counter-offensive, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in terms of manpower and material.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – Soviet forces are continuing their counter-offensive around Moscow, while the Germans are rushing to reinforce their troops. A large number of reinforcements of tanks have arrived in the Maloyaroslavets area. German forces have twice attempted to cross the Oka River but have been driven back. The 131st division attempted to cross the river at Alexin but was also repelled, suffering heavy losses. According to the Soviet newspaper Pravda, German forces in Mozhaisk attempted a localized advance but failed. To resist the new German offensive against Leningrad, Soviet forces on the northern front are sending reinforcements to the area between Tikhvin and Lake Ladoga, which is covered in deep snow, to bravely fight the enemy.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – The troops led by Soviet General Zhukov are holding their ground in four locations south and southwest of Moscow, resisting the constant heavy attacks of enemy tanks and aircraft. They have now repelled a new German attack. The four locations are Tula (100 miles south of Moscow), Serpukhov (60 miles south of Moscow, at the confluence of the Nara and Oka rivers), Alexin (midway between Tula and Serpukhov), and Maloyaroslavets (65 miles southwest of Moscow). After a brief respite, German forces on the southern outskirts of Tula have launched a renewed attack, resulting in fierce fighting. The weather on the central front has become severely cold, and German casualties are increasingly heavy. Many German tanks have been destroyed by Soviet artillery fire. German forces in Serpukhov and Alexin have attempted to cross the Oka River but have been repelled, suffering heavy losses. German forces have also attempted to break through the Soviet defenses at Maloyaroslavets but have been repelled. The Soviets claim that large mechanized units of German forces in the Donets Basin have launched renewed attacks without any success. Regarding the Crimean Peninsula, Axis sources report that German troops have advanced to within twenty miles of Kerch, but this has not been confirmed by the Soviets. Yesterday's German High Command communique stated that both Sevastopol and Kerch on the peninsula were effectively bombed by the German Air Force. Berlin admits that Soviet forces in these two ports are putting up strong resistance. The Germans claim to have occupied Tikhvin (a railway town about 100 miles southeast of Leningrad), but this has not yet been confirmed. Lacking other victories, the Germans are exaggerating their gains in Tikhvin, claiming to have cut off Leningrad's transportation to the interior. According to a dispatch from the Turin newspaper La Stampa, reported by the Vichy news agency, when Axis forces entered the city of Yalta on the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula, they found it scarred and desolate. The city, once a famous resort, had only ruins left of its exquisite villas and sanatoriums. A major fire had broken out in the modern building district, leaving almost no building intact.</p>
<p>Soviet Frontline Fierce Fighting; German Offensive Halted</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – A Reuters military commentator states that yesterday's German communique only reported local progress toward Sevastopol and Kerch on the Crimean Peninsula, as well as the bombing of Moscow by German aircraft and minor gains by German-Finnish forces in Karelia. All of this seems insignificant enough to warrant a special announcement from the High Command. The Soviet communique reports fierce fighting on the front lines, with German forces, aided by tanks and aircraft, attempting to advance on Tula and an area northeast of that city. It remains unclear whether this move is intended to relieve pressure from Soviet forces on the northern front or to cover a rumored retreat. In any case, both German offensives have been halted and have suffered heavy losses. Unofficial Soviet sources report that Soviet forces under General Timoshenko, defending the Don River, are now showing a tendency to attack, putting pressure on the German-Hungarian forces north of Kharkov. If the Soviets can muster a sufficiently strong force and strike a heavy blow, the Axis mixed forces in this area will be in an unfavorable situation. The general tone of reports from Moscow is largely optimistic. The German advance in the areas from Leningrad to Rostov seems to have reached its maximum extent, and Soviet forces seem to be preparing to seize the opportunity to counter-attack. As far as the Caucasus is concerned, the Crimean Peninsula may not be a fatal weakness, as the Germans will have to conduct a large-scale military operation to take the strong defensive lines of Sevastopol and Kerch on the peninsula. It is doubtful whether the Germans will launch a major offensive in these two areas during the winter. During the current season, the Black Sea is often subject to storms and darkness, hence its ancient name. Within a few weeks, the entire northern coast from Odessa to Novorossiysk will freeze, and it will not thaw for at least three or four months.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – The Swedish capital reports that German tanks and assault troops are approaching the naval bases of Sevastopol and the Kerch Strait in Crimea. Soviet People's Commissar for the Navy and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Kuznetsov, assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Crimean Front last night. In addition, naval leaders Voktialbinski and Yumashev will assist him. Kuznetsov is currently forty years old and served as commander of the Black Sea Fleet several years ago.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, German Headquarters, 12th – Today's German war report stated that German and Romanian forces in Crimea have advanced to the coast south of Kerch. German aircraft continue to bomb Soviet positions in Sevastopol, Kerch, and Anapa. German infantry and armored columns south of Tula are carrying out an encirclement offensive, defeating several large units of Soviet cavalry. Soviet forces besieged in Leningrad attempted to launch a counter-offensive but were ultimately defeated.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Four Types of Daily Necessities; Legal Foreign Exchange Has Been Obtained; Satisfactory Results from the Director's Trip to Hong Kong; Foreign Exchange Approved for Rice, Flour, Oil, and Coal; French Concession Has Formulated Direct Retail Addresses for Imported Goods <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council’s Information Office, the council has received word from the Chairman, Mr. Little, returning from Hong Kong, that the council’s representative has completed negotiations with the Hong Kong Exchange Fund Committee. The committee has agreed to provide the council with legal foreign exchange to purchase sufficient rice, flour, and cooking oil. As a result, these essential items will be provided to the public at stable prices. The council is making every effort to secure adequate supplies as quickly as possible. In addition, foreign exchange for the purchase of coal has also been obtained, facilitating the continued ordering of coal to meet the necessary minimum demand during the winter.</p>
<p>Three Conditions for Foreign Exchange Items</p>
<p>The Exchange Fund's provision of foreign exchange to the Shanghai Municipal Council is inevitably subject to three basic conditions: 1. Items imported with foreign exchange provided by the Exchange Fund must be sold within the Concession and prohibited from flowing into occupied areas. 2. Items imported with foreign exchange provided by the Exchange Fund will be exclusively sold under the Shanghai Municipal Council’s control, preventing unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating to maintain price stability. 3. For requests from other importers for the Shanghai Municipal Council to apply to the Exchange Fund for foreign exchange, in addition to meeting the conditions of being limited to sales within the Concession and preventing hoarding, the importer must sell the foreign exchange earned from their export operations to the Exchange Fund.</p>
<p>Import Merchants Association Studies Actions</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, an association composed of importers and manufacturers held a special emergency meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council to review the price situation after the Shanghai Municipal Council controlled the price of rice, and to study the parallel actions the association should take. Although the results of the meeting have not been officially disclosed by the Shanghai Municipal Council, responsible sources with reliable news claim that the Importers Association will, by the end of this week or early next week, manage items sold by food companies and pharmacies, such as imported or locally manufactured food, condiments, cleaning materials, medicines, cigarettes, tobacco, soap, and beverages. As for the method of implementation, the Importers Association will assess the maximum price of each item for its members and hand it over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for enforcement. The Importers Association will also clearly stipulate the quantities for sale and order all retail stores to comply.</p>
<p>One Million US Dollars for Coal Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Regarding the four essential items mentioned above—rice, flour, oil, and coal—authorities at the Exchange Fund have decided to provide foreign exchange needed to import 250,000 bags of foreign rice each month, valued at approximately US$2 million. The first batch of 60,000 bags of flour, requiring approximately US$110,000 in foreign exchange (at the Exchange Fund price), equivalent to two million national currency units, has also been approved by the Exchange Fund. The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently preparing for the advance payment, and the batch of flour will arrive in Shanghai shortly. As for coal, it is possible that one million US dollars will be provided each month, but this has not yet been fully decided, as the situation for coal is more complicated due to its sources not being limited to one country. Regarding coal, the Exchange Fund will only provide industrial-use bituminous coal from India, which belongs to the sterling bloc. White coal, because it is produced in Annam and its use is not considered essential, has been denied foreign exchange. However, for coal dust (white coal), which is a raw material for coal briquettes, although it is produced in Hon Gai, Annam, and is classified as a non-essential item, the Shanghai Municipal Council’s request to grant foreign exchange will be approved. Therefore, the one million US dollars mentioned above includes only Indian bituminous coal and Hon Gai coal dust. Most of the cooking oil comes from Qingdao and Dalian, and the required foreign exchange is relatively small. Therefore, the only issue is how the Shanghai Municipal Council can prevent hoarding and control its price.</p>
<p>Direct Retail Addresses Selected</p>
<p>French authorities, after some importers expressed a willingness to sell their imported goods directly to the public at retail prices agreed upon with the French Concession authorities, hereby announce that locations have been reserved for importers within the Eight Immortals Bridge Small Vegetable Market. Those interested can apply to the Finance Department at 375 Avenue Joffre, which will issue licenses in accordance with normal procedures.</p>
<p>Many Reports and Whistleblowers</p>
<p>Since the French Concession Police Department launched its campaign to suppress prices at the beginning of this week, thirty-two shops within the Concession have been punished for hoarding and profiteering. Plainclothes policemen from the French Police Department continued to search for profiteering merchants yesterday morning, and it is expected that more stores will be investigated and punished. To date, most of the shops punished for selling at prices higher than the official fixed price were reported to the French Police Department by the public. According to an official, citizens are now providing the authorities with great assistance, as the public has long suffered under the heavy burden of high prices. Now they are taking the opportunity to come forward and report spontaneously, with some even going to various shops in the morning to inquire about prices and immediately reporting to nearby policemen if they hear prices higher than the official fixed price.</p>
<p>Strict Secret Inspections in the French Concession</p>
<p>It is reported that yesterday afternoon, 34 cans of 5-gallon gasoline were found at 122 and 252A Rue de Menton, with prices exceeding the fixed price. In the French Concession this week, eight shops were punished for not clearly marking prices, sixteen shops were punished for exceeding the fixed price, seven shops were punished for cheating with measuring instruments, and one shop was punished for secretly raising prices. It was also learned that the Zhao Feng Sauce Garden at 76 Rue du Père Froc was found by the French Police Department to be selling oils that did not meet compositional standards, and its products are being suspended and sent for chemical testing and investigation. It is rumored that the French Police Department will gradually conduct random inspections of food stores within the Concession that sell foods that do not meet compositional standards in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Business Corps Assists in Rice Management; Increasingly Thorough <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have assisted the Shanghai Municipal Council in implementing its new rice management regulations issued on Sunday for the past three days, with several squads of corps members being dispatched daily to take on special tasks. Although only over a hundred corps members are on duty in rotation for 24 hours a day, all corps members have been mobilized and ordered to be prepared to respond to emergency calls. First, on Sunday evening, the fourth company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was ordered to be fully armed and dispatched to duty, and then replaced by another team on Monday. In this way, each company of the entire corps must rotate on duty. What can be confirmed at present is that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will continue to carry out its duties past the end of this week.</p>
<p>Currently, two vehicles, a car and an armored car, patrol the "B" area, which stretches from Yuqiaqing Road in the west to North Henan Road in the east, at a speed of about ten miles per hour. Each car carries eight corps members, and the shifts are changed every hour. At night, sentries are stationed around the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Headquarters on Fuzhou Road, with each company assigning at least two sentries per hour. When Shanghai Volunteer Corps members patrol by car, they maintain order in front of the rice shops in the area. The remaining members of the company prepare to respond to any emergencies in the headquarters. Officials claim that the dispatch of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the past few days has eliminated the tense situation in front of the rice shops, and no riots have occurred. At the same time, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps continues to send sentries to the foreign White Rainbow Bridge and North Henan Road defense posts to assist police officers in preventing the transportation of rice to Hongkou or Zhabei, with a total of five people at each post.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Churchill's Speech Has a Significant Impact on Japan; Shanghai Japanese Military Spokesman Publicly Admits; Says It Attempts to Provoke War Between the United States and Japan <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Two non-commissioned officers and three gardeners; each guard puts in an 8 hour shift in rotation.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army spokesman stated at a press conference here yesterday (November 11) that if the United States and Britain continue to provide assistance to the governments with which Japan is currently at war, peace in the Pacific cannot be maintained. This action by the civilian government is intended to contain Japan, and the US and British aid to China is the cause of the current tense situation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister's Speech Is Regrettable</p>
<p>The spokesman mentioned that the British Prime Minister, Churchill, said in his speech that if war breaks out between the United States and Japan, Britain will immediately declare war on Japan, saying that the Prime Minister's speech is quite regrettable and that its purpose may be to try to provoke war between the United States and Japan. If the attempt to resolve the Pacific problem does not take into special consideration the Sino-Japanese War, this attempt cannot be permitted by the Japanese military and civilians. This statement means that if the civilian government does not stop aiding China, the problems between the United States and Japan cannot be resolved. However, the spokesman refused to make a clear contribution on this point, but said,</p>
<p>Shifting Responsibility and Retorting with Intimidation</p>
<p>The recent tension in the Pacific cannot be entirely blamed on Japan. The Japanese people are indeed eager to maintain peace with the United States. The spokesman also said that Churchill's speech was a threat or intimidation to Japan, but the Japanese people, no matter what, are eager to maintain peace and are determined not to change because of such threats or intimidation. If peace can be maintained, then this peace should not be humiliating to Japan. If war breaks out between Japan and the civilian government, war will also be seen in the Indian Ocean, and Britain's transportation money to India will be threatened by the Japanese Navy. The Pope recently delivered a broadcast speech expressing his hope that peace will be maintained in the Pacific. Japan also holds this hope, so a special envoy was sent to Washington to negotiate.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 75th anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. From morning to night, the national emblem was hung all over the two concessions, splendid and solemn, fully demonstrating the loyalty and fortitude of millions of citizens in the city. On the one hand, they actively promoted movements such as saving and dedicating to disaster relief. All sectors of society also respectfully expressed their respect to Chairman Chiang yesterday. Today is the fourth anniversary of the fall of Shanghai to the Western Army. Although all sectors of society cannot hold ceremonies, in order to recall the past and commemorate the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers, citizens will voluntarily stop entertainment and banquets, and eat vegetarian food for one day. At noon, everyone will silently stand in their respective positions for three minutes to mourn the soldiers and compatriots who died in the war.

<p>In view of the fact that the severe winter is approaching and the cold is pressing, tens of thousands of men, women, old, and young refugees and sick, disabled, women, and children in Nanshi whose original cotton clothes and trousers are becoming increasingly tattered and cannot keep out the cold, the Puyi Craft Society respectfully appeals to all sectors of society to avoid starvation and freezing. It is hoped that kind-hearted people in society will give assistance based on their past enthusiasm for disaster relief, or donate cash (15 yuan per set).</p>
<p>Winter Clothing Relief</p>
<p>Or generously donate winter clothes, so that those who have the means to keep out the cold can overcome difficulties. Since the society issued a notice in the middle of the month for the collection of 50,000 yuan, it aims to maintain and expand the original craft relief. It provides relief to about 500 adult refugees every day, including refugees working and the sick, and about 500 children and babies without support, including students and nursery babies. In addition, it also provides relief to more than 200 poor and unemployed refugees, distributing rice and wheat every day to relieve their urgent needs. There are many other poor men and women who register with the society every day to get work, but unfortunately there are more monks than porridge, and limited by economics, they cannot be accommodated and given vocational training. It is hoped that the society will show great sympathy and give active assistance.</p>

<p>— Yang Zhongyi</p>
<p>At the 25th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the origins of Islam, saying: Islam has always been kept secret. Only Wang Dai and Liu Zhi began to write about it, and the origins of the four foreigners are mentioned in Zhifang Waiji, Dizhi Jiuyi, Fangyu Jiyao, Xiyu Shi Di, Xiyu Huibu Zhi, Yuan Zheng Xiyu Kao, Tianfang Jiao Kao, Huijiao Kao Lue, Tianfang Tanpan, Siyi Jiangyu, Fengsu Kao, etc.</p>
<p>The name of the religion is not uniform. Tianfang is based on the place, Qingzhen is based on religious meaning, Islam is based on transliteration, and Hui is based on the transliteration of Huihe and Huihu. Gu Yanwu's Rizhilu and Hang Shijun's Daogutang Ji disagreed with Qian Daxin's Twenty-Two History Kao Yi. The Yuan History calls it Tashiman. The transliteration of the religious message is not uniform. The Tongdian quotes Du Huan's Jingxing Ji as "Mumen," Jia Dan's Sixi Zhi of the Tang Dynasty, and the "Muhammad" in the Da Shi Zhuan of the Tang Dynasty, "Maxiawu" in the Song Dynasty's Lingwai Da Da, "Mahamma" in the Yuan History, "Mahama Yi" in the Ming History's Tianfang Zhuan, "Mohanmode" in the Mo De Na Zhuan, "Mohanmode" in the New Yuan History, "Muhammad" in the World Chronology, "Ma Hemei" in the Geography Beikao, "Mohamai" in the Yinghuan Zhilue, "Muhammed" in the Waiguo Shilue, and "Mahamede" and "Ban Muma Du" in the Wanguo Zongjiao Zhi. The year of birth is difficult to determine. The ancient history of Tianfang says, "E'rsa's tradition is not known, and Muhammad was born 600 years later." The World Events Chronology says, "571 AD, when Emperor Chen Yi built the Great Building for three years," and the World Geography Complete Atlas, Yinghuan Zhilue, Monthly Statistics, etc. also take it as the first year.</p>
<p>Birthplace. The Tang and Song Histories call it Dashi, and the Ming History divides it into Tianfang, A'dan, and Medina. The Moga village is found in the Quan Yu Ji, and the Gu Liezhong is found in the New Tang History. He lost his father at the age of two, his mother at the age of four, and his grandfather at the age of eight. He followed his uncle in business in his youth. The Religious History says that he was a merchant in Bolin at the age of twenty-five and diligently served the wealthy merchant Ma Fu, who married him, and he became rich suddenly. At the age of thirty-eight, he hid in Bira Mountain, meditating and contemplating, and realized the Tao in his prime. He obtained the assistance of the Zoroastrians (according to the Xixi Conghua) and the Christians (according to the Xuefuzhai Zazhe), reformed the heresy of the Trinity, created the religion of the only pure God, and reconciled the various theories of India, Persia, Judaism, and Jesus, and elaborated them into a book called the Koran, which has thirty volumes, one hundred and forty chapters, and six thousand six hundred and sixty-six chapters. The Ming History says that there are more than three thousand six hundred paragraphs, and the Guangdong Tongzhi says that there are more than three thousand six hundred volumes. Hang's Jingjiao Xu Kao, "The ancient history of Tianfang says that there are thirty collections of scriptures in the country, from A'dan to E'rsa, a total of one hundred and fourteen parts." Wei Yuan's Tianfang Jiao Kao is the same. It is also translated as Gelan, originally Fur Jiani, or Gur A'ni, which in Chinese means declaration, or the Heavenly Scripture, or the Precious Life True Scripture. The Haiguo Tuzhi note 1 discusses the name of the scripture given to Mother Pie, which is the Pentateuch of Moses, "then the Burjiang is the name of the scripture given to Da Wu De," which is David, and the Yin Zina, which is the name of the scripture given to E'rsa," which is the four Gospels, and E'rsa Yu Zhengxie said, which is the transliteration of Jesus. Short chapters have only two or three paragraphs, while longer ones have hundreds of thousands of words. (To be continued)</p>

The arrangement and decoration of the burial site and inside and outside the E'li Garden yesterday is said to have reached more than 200,000 gold. Its extravagance is no less than the past rumors of Sheng Xingsheng's funeral, which was uniquely beautiful. A few days ago, on Jing'an Temple Road in front of the garden, there were two large plain-colored arches spanning the road from east to west. The electric lights were bright at night. On the left side of the garden gate, there were blue characters "Deng Qing Yun Jie" and "Cheng Da Zizai". There was also an archway erected at the gate, with "Zun Zi" hanging high. In order to maintain order and protect the guests, the police station specially sent a large number of detectives to be stationed inside and outside the garden.</p>
<p>Entering the Soil at Three O'Clock. From the second gate in the garden to the "Zai Shou Tang" ceremony hall, blue and white cloth curtains were erected along the way, with elegiac couplets and sacrificial essays hanging densely. The "Hai You Ling Tang" was even more surrounded by incense smoke, and the sacrificial table was filled with rare and precious items. A blue neon light with the words "Jia Fan Penglai" and "Da Dian Zi" was suspended in the center, followed by the portrait of Luo Jialing. The Fuxin Company broadcasted in the auditorium, and in the morning, guests came to pay their respects in an endless stream. At about 3:00 PM, the Luo family gathered together, dressed in plain clothes, and lined up to the cemetery next to the Lanjiasesa in the southeast corner of the garden to hold the burial ceremony. Then, sixty-four porters carried Luo's remains to the cemetery, led by the full guard of honor, and hoisted them into the tomb with a crane. She was officially buried and slept with the deceased Hatong. The grand burial ceremony, which had been arranged for many days, also came to an end.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education is paying special attention to the establishment and management of tutoring schools at this extraordinary time. The Regulations on Tutoring Schools have been promulgated before. Recently, a Provisional Method for the Management of Tutoring Schools in Extraordinary Times has been formulated and ordered to be followed by the Education Bureaus of all provinces. The main points of the method are as follows:</p>
<p>Tutoring schools shall not have any words or deeds that violate the Three People's Principles and contradict national policies. During the period of resistance and construction, the establishment of private tutoring schools should be temporarily restricted. Private tutoring schools that have been approved for establishment should be strictly examined by the competent education authorities. Education administrative organs at all levels should prepare a general situation table of tutoring schools within their jurisdiction every six months, detailing the name, founder, location, year and month of establishment, disciplines, number of teachers and students, expenses, and their sources, and report them to the Ministry for record.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Ministry Issued Provisional Rules (4) for Building School Buildings Above the Vocational Level <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Article 11: When newly established or relocated public and private vocational schools are designated by the Ministry to be located in a province, city, or county, the selection of the school site should be located as far away as possible from the bustling urban area. Before building the school building, the school should carefully select the school site, conduct detailed surveys, record the environmental conditions, create charts, and submit them to the Ministry for approval. Article 12: Public and private vocational schools should establish a school building construction committee to engage in design review, supervision, and other matters. Five to seven teachers and staff members from the school's affairs meeting should be elected to organize it. The principal, the head of affairs, and the accounting officer are natural members, and the principal is the chairman of the committee. When necessary, the Ministry may send personnel to the meeting for guidance. After the school building construction committee is organized, national vocational schools and provincial and municipal private vocational schools that have been subsidized by the Ministry for construction expenses should report to the Ministry for record. Provincial and municipal vocational schools should report to the provincial and municipal governments to which they belong for record. When reporting for record, the duties and experience of each member should be attached.</p>
<p>Article 13: National vocational schools and provincial and municipal private vocational schools that have been subsidized by the Ministry for construction expenses should submit an application to the Ministry for approval in accordance with the following steps: 1. Compile and calculate; 2. Send detailed construction plans; 3. Open and award bids; 4. Complete and check and accept. Provincial and municipal vocational schools should submit an application to the provincial and municipal governments to which they belong in accordance with the following steps when building school buildings with provincial and municipal funds. Private vocational schools should submit detailed construction plans to the Ministry for handling in accordance with the second procedure below when building school buildings with private funds or funds from private legal entities.</p>
<p>Article 14: National vocational schools and provincial and municipal private vocational schools that have been subsidized by the Ministry for construction expenses should first compile a temporary expense estimate in accordance with the budget preparation procedure, attach a brief plan, calculate the reasons for construction, the size and form of each proposed unit, the main materials used, and the required expenses, and attach a sketch to be sent to the Ministry for review and transfer. After the budget has been approved and established, the school shall prepare detailed construction plans within the budget and send them for review.</p>
<p>Article 15: When submitting detailed construction plans, the following documents should be obtained: 1. Construction plan form and sketch; 2. School building overview form and school building distribution map; 3. Detailed drawings and work instructions for the construction project; 4. Bidding rules and contract format.</p>
<p>Article 16: After the construction drawings and documents in the preceding article have been approved by the Ministry and put on file, the school may publicly invite bids. When opening and awarding bids, the school should also apply to the Ministry to send personnel to supervise. Projects with a cost of less than 5,000 yuan may be approved to use the comparison method to determine the winner.</p>
<p>Article 17: After the completion of the project, in addition to handling the reimbursement and final account in accordance with accounting procedures, the school should first report the progress of the project to the Ministry and ask the Ministry to send personnel to supervise the acceptance. Article 18: The procedures for provincial and municipal vocational schools to submit budget construction plans and inter-bid award acceptance to provincial and municipal governments are the same as those in Articles 13 to 17.</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Actual Situation of Education in Anhui Province Over the Past Three Years (Part 2) <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>However, due to limited funds and inadequate relief, the Central Relief Committee allocated 10,000 yuan per month in the twenty-ninth year to the education of refugee children. Consequently, the Education Department universally stipulated enrollment quotas for refugee children in all temporary primary schools throughout the province. 36 temporary primary schools were established in the north of the Yangtze River. Except for the temporary primary school in Lihuang, which had an enrollment quota of 150 students, each of the other schools enrolled 30 students. Twelve temporary primary schools were established in southern Anhui, with each school enrolling 20 students. In total, there were 38 temporary primary schools in the province, capable of educating and nurturing 1,140 refugee children. Regarding the printing of primary school textbooks, transportation was disrupted in various regions after the outbreak of war, making it impossible for schools in Anhui Province to purchase textbooks. Recognizing this, the Education Department printed mimeographed textbooks at the beginning of the first semester of the twenty-eighth year and inspected counties to ensure their reproduction. By the twenty-ninth year, the textbooks required by primary schools at all levels were entirely printed by the Education Department and distributed to various counties for purchase and distribution, ensuring they were all available before the start of the school year. Regarding the training of primary school teachers, during the first semester of the twenty-eighth year, the training of local primary school teachers in Anhui Province was originally conducted within the "Anhui Provincial Government Military Cadre Training Class," where qualified individuals were selected for intensive training. However, only one session was held before it was discontinued for various reasons. Subsequently, in the second semester of the same year, the Education Department formulated the "Methods for Counties to Conduct Short-Term Training for Township and Village Primary School Teachers," issuing a circular to all counties to conduct training separately.</p>

<p>Before the war, there were a total of 88 provincial, joint-county, and private middle schools in Anhui Province, comprising 502 grades with approximately 20,000 students. Due to the war, most of the schools located near dangerous areas were relocated to safer regions. Subsequently, as the war spread, with the exception of five provincial schools in southern Anhui, which managed to maintain operations with great effort, the remaining schools along the Yangtze River and Huai River almost entirely ceased operations. Joint-county and private middle schools also struggled to survive due to the Education Department's suspension of subsidies, and many were forced to discontinue schooling. In the summer of the twenty-seventh year, teachers and students from provincial schools successively fled to Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou. The Ministry of Education merged the displaced teachers and students, establishing the National Anhui Middle School in Suoli Town, Qiancheng County, western Hunan (renamed National Eighth Middle School in the twenty-eighth year), and established branches in nearby areas, accommodating over 3,800 students. The Ministry of Education also established the National Anhui First Middle School in Jiangjin County, Sichuan (renamed National Ninth Middle School in the twenty-eighth year), with departments for senior high, junior high, and teacher training, accommodating over 1,800 students. In addition to allocating 16,000 yuan per month from the Anhui provincial contribution funds for regular expenses,</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the education departments of sixteen provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Gansu, Kang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Ningxia, to conduct a detailed review of whether the areas for normal schools in each province have been clearly defined, whether normal schools have been added on schedule, whether adjustments have been made, whether enrollment methods and other improvements have been effectively implemented, and to what extent they have been implemented.

<h3 id="e53">Second Act of the 300 Charity Basketball Game: Paramount Heavily Defeats Blue &amp; White 45-31; Women's Marksmanship: Jingwu Beats Shanghai Star <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The second major battle of the Shanghai Star Sports-sponsored Three-Strength Charity Basketball Tournament took place last night, with Paramount facing Blue &amp; White. Prior to the game, there was a women's performance, with Shanghai Star playing Jingwu. In the previous charity basketball game for student aid, Paramount and Blue &amp; White were separated by the most precious one point. In addition, the women's performance was also wonderful, resulting in a large crowd gathering at the China Youth Ball Room, creating a grand scene. As a result, Jingwu defeated Shanghai Star by a score of 34 to 14 in the opening act. In the main game, Paramount heavily defeated Blue &amp; White by a score of 45 to 31. Blue &amp; White showed promise at the beginning of the game, but their performance declined midway. However, in the second half, they managed to tie the score at 24 points each. Due to Paramount's teamwork and sharp offensive, they ultimately overwhelmed Blue &amp; White by a significant margin. From this point on, Shanghai Star has taken the most advantageous position in the three-strength situation. However, if Blue &amp; White can defeat Shanghai Star on Saturday, they will once again create a balance of power among the three teams, making the championship a confusing situation. If Shanghai Star can maintain its momentum, the championship will be within reach. A brief account of the battle is as follows:</p>
<p>Paramount Takes the Lead</p>
<p>After the women's performance ended in a one-sided affair, the main game continued. Wang Jinghu of Paramount scored four points first. After several possessions, Li Zude of Blue &amp; White made a free throw to open the scoring. Nanhua then made a free throw and another shot. Fan Qingxian and Bao Songyuan then scored nine points in quick succession, taking the lead with a score of 9 to 4. However, in a short time, Paramount followed suit, with Chen Xianglong scoring a bullseye and Youliang and Jinghu continuing to add points, quickly taking the lead again with a score of 11 to 9. Fan Qingxian of Blue &amp; White tied the score at 11 points each. Zhang Shao of Paramount immediately responded. Wang Jinghu scored three more times, giving Paramount a comfortable lead of 19 to 13. By the time Chen Bangzhen scored, the half-time whistle had blown, with Paramount leading 19 to 13.</p>
<p>Blue &amp; White Suffers a Setback</p>
<p>After switching sides, Youliang and Shaoqing scored in succession. After Li Zude of Blue &amp; White scored, Qu Xilin of Paramount committed his fourth foul and was replaced by Da Zhen. Taking advantage of Paramount's loose defense, Blue &amp; White scored three points in succession. Xianglong made a free throw, bringing the score to 14 to 18. Blue &amp; White then had another opportunity, with Fan and Li both scoring, and Qingxian adding another point, creating a tied score of 24 points each. The atmosphere on the court suddenly became tense. However, in a short time, the situation changed again. Youliang made one free throw and one field goal, and Da Zhen and Jinghu also scored free throws and field goals alternately. In a blink of an eye, Paramount took a comfortable lead again with a score of 30 to 24. Bao Songyuan of Blue &amp; White was fouled out for the fourth time, weakening the defense. When Qiu Xiaoci was brought on, Wang Jinghu of Paramount scored again. Although Wang Nanqun of Blue &amp; White responded, Da Zhen and Jinghu continued to press forward. Blue &amp; White brought on Ren Yawei, but it was of no help to the overall situation. Paramount had smooth sailing all the way. Although Chen Xianglong was also fouled out for the fourth time and replaced by Ying Baojia, Paramount ultimately triumphed over Blue &amp; White with a score of 45 to 31.</p>

<p>- Air-conditioned goods are on the market and prices are also rising - Longan meat has not been arriving for a long time. The air-conditioned goods on the market are no different in color from fresh meat, so the market price has been increasing. It was found that the Guangdong No. 1 ship imported a small amount from Xiamen the day before yesterday. Only a few pieces of old goods were opened for sale yesterday, and the quoted price also rose by 200 yuan. New goods can continue to be opened today, and the price will hardly be relaxed.</p>

<p>Walter Nick's sales have been quite brisk recently. Its Western-style clothing is now very popular. The formal and beautiful flannel fabric of Walter Nick is currently very scarce in the market, leading to active sales of colored stripes and checks, herringbones, and light and dark Walter Nick. The production of this factory's goods is also higher than other Western-style fabrics. The cutting and sales of sturdy and thick Walter Nick clothing fabrics are also strong. Navy blue and grass green Walter Nick are also selling very well in the market. Imported goods, which are water-resistant and have a gray-yellow Walter Nick, are in high demand in the Western-style clothing industry, resulting in a shortage of supply. Prices in each bridge are very expensive. Yesterday, gray and hidden Walter Polovers were sold for 130 to 140 yuan per yard. This factory's evergreen and grass green Walter Nick were sold for 62-3 yuan to 70 yuan per yard. Herringbone willow Walter Nick, the first grade was sold for 83-5 yuan, the second grade for 73-5 yuan. British-made goods, the first grade is 140-50 yuan, the second grade is 110-20 yuan. Korean goods are generally sold for about 100 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Tea <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>One thing, as long as it is truly beneficial to the world, it will never be confined to the place of origin for the enjoyment of a few people, but must travel far and wide to benefit the whole world. I will now briefly describe the process by which tea, which soothes our daily worries and quenches our thirst, has gradually spread to our country and the world.</p>
<p>Tea is an evergreen shrub belonging to the Camellia family. For many years, everyone has acknowledged that it originated in southern China. However, in the second half of the nineteenth century, several foreigners discovered several wild tea trees in the Kashmir Valley of northern India, and then began to argue about whether the motherland of tea was actually in India. I think this is just a matter of curiosity, deliberately making that reversal article to sensationalize people. You think that the southern part of our country and the northern part of India are so close to each other in the same zone, and we must say that tea originated in India and not in our country. Isn’t it a bit like carving a boat to find a sword? Moreover, just taking a few wild tea trees to overthrow the established case since ancient times to usurp the host, the evidence is too weak: because not only are the records of tea trees in ancient Chinese books the earliest and most detailed, but also the custom of drinking tea originated from our country, and those wild states are more difficult to count as recorded in ancient Chinese books, so how can we explain this? Furthermore, even now in the famous mountains in the south of our country that are rarely visited, can we say that we cannot see this kind of tea tree that is not cultivated by human power? … There are already many idle words, please describe them in detail. The oldest books in our country that record tea trees, apart from Shennong Materia Medica, which is a forgery, are only Erya and Book of Songs. Erya's "Jia Ku Tu" in the Shimu chapter is interpreted by commentators as: "The tree is small, like gardenia, and leaves grow in winter, which can be cooked as a soup. Today, those who pick it early are called tea, and those who pick it late are called Ming..." The saying "Who says Tu is bitter, its sweetness is like shepherd's purse" in the Book of Songs, Beifeng, is thought by most commentators to be "Tu" which refers to bitter vegetables, and Su Dongpo thought that this is also the tea we eat. One——Tu and tea are originally one word, and they were only divided into two after the Han Dynasty. ——In this way, Erya is said to be created by the Duke of Zhou: assuming that the commentators did not misinterpret its original text, our country already knew about the existence of tea in the twelfth century BC. To take a step back, the book was not written by the Duke of Zhou, but by Confucius' disciples, "to explain the words of the six arts," as recent people have believed, then its era was also in the fifth and sixth centuries BC. The age of the Book of Songs is before Confucius, which is known to everyone.</p>
<p>If someone dislikes the above-quoted words for being a bit confusing and unreliable, well, let’s now look at a piece of concrete evidence—Wang Bao’s article——and the matter itself is very ridiculous and funny. It turned out that Wang Bao, a writer of the Western Han Dynasty, in the third year of Emperor Xuan of Han’s Shenjue, 61 BC, "went to Jian (now Chengdu) to the house of Yang Hui, a widow. There was a slave named Bian Liao, who asked to sell wine. Bian Liao defended with a large staff..." and said: "Sir——Yang Hui's deceased husband bought Bian Liao with the agreement to only guard the house, not to sell wine for other men!..." You see how smug and stubborn this guy is! Wang Bao couldn't help but get angry and wanted to find a way to buy this treasure from Yang Hui so that he could teach him a lesson. But what about Bian Liao? He said angrily: "If you want to use it, you must have a certificate: without a certificate, Bian Liao cannot do it!" Wang Bao then gave him a detailed account of what he should do day and night, including a sentence that when guests came, he should "bake turtle and cook Tu." There is also a sentence that says "Buy tea in Wuyang (south of present-day Chengdu)." The commentators interpreted the word "Tu" in the first sentence as bitter vegetables, and the word "tea" in the second sentence as the tea we eat now: I think the first sentence already seems to be the tea we eat now. In any case, the habit of drinking tea in our country, in this 61 BC, in this southwest Sichuan, was already quite popular, but there is this iron-like evidence, which cannot be denied by anyone.</p>
<p>According to the Biography of Wei Yao in the Wu Zhi of the Three Kingdoms, Sun Hao, the emperor of the Wu Kingdom, "at every banquet, regardless of whether he could drink or not, he limited it to seven liters... Suo drank no more than three liters of wine..., and should be reduced as a relief, or secretly given "tea sauce instead of wine." It was in the middle of the third century AD that the custom of drinking tea had gradually spread from remote Sichuan to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, although we have no way to trace the route of this spread.

<h3 id="e67">I Love Commissioner Liang's "Old" Ways <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ercang</p>
<p>After watching Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," everyone will have a kind of cordial feeling for this old Commissioner Liang. Yes, Commissioner Liang is indeed old, but I think he is lovely in his old age.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese people mostly love the old, for example, goods should choose old brands, and talents should choose experienced ones. Naturally, the tendency to love the old is a manifestation of pursuing good, and it is not to be criticized. But blindly praising the old is a problem. So a footnote can be added here, that is, the fame of old brands is not due to the newness or oldness of the brand, but because of its meticulousness when it was not old. The trust gained by experienced people is not due to age, but due to their previous outstanding achievements. Otherwise, if they have lost their reputation before they are old, what use is it even if they are old?</p>
<p>However, the way humans age is ultimately different from the aging of goods. Because the cruelty of time often shortens the journey of human life. As an elderly person, since he cannot place ardent hopes on the distant future, after enjoying flowers and admiring the moon, he is known for selling his age, on the one hand, sighing about the decline of the world, and on the other hand, dissatisfied with the rashness and uselessness of young people, while he himself covers himself in the big coat of "I am old" and shrinks into a ball.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a ridiculous and pitiful way of aging, and the difficulty of aging lies in this point.</p>
<p>As I write this, I can't help but think of the fall of two elders. One was the Polish statesman and piano virtuoso Paderewski, who died on June 30 of this year, and the other was the world-renowned Indian poet and philosopher Tagore, who died on August 7. Even after his country was destroyed, the former was still working in foreign countries to help refugees from his country, while the latter, until his death, was always thinking about completing the establishment of an ideal international peace. And there is no shortage of such elderly people in China. Some go to jail calmly, thousands of miles away, like Mr. Shen Junru; some devote their lives to education, like Mr. Zhang Boling. Undoubtedly, we should judge such elderly people by their spirit and achievements! They carry pure integrity, brilliant past, do not sigh, do not sell their age; and the important thing is that they will seize the reality and not be the dregs of the times. In this way, silver silk and white hair, old and slow, is still a symbol of youth.</p>
<p>"You are still young, I am older than you!" Yes, Commissioner Liang is indeed six years older than Xi Tang, but from this humorous atmosphere, it brings a good news: he is not old!</p>
<p>What I love is this way of aging.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Hudson's Centennial Anniversary <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>The British writer and ornithological author, Hudson, was born on August 4, 1841. This year marks the centennial of his birth. British newspapers have published articles commemorating this man of letters who suffered from poverty and illness throughout his life. Let us take this opportunity to introduce his life as follows:</p>
<p>Hudson's parents were American. He was born in the capital of Argentina, South America, one hundred years ago. He only became a British citizen in 1900 when he settled in London.</p>
<p>From childhood, he showed a love for birds. Before leaving South America for England at the age of twenty-nine, he spent his free time wandering the unique prairies of South America. This experience was extremely important for his later writing on ornithological literature.</p>
<p>Hudson published his debut work, "The Purple Land," in 1885. (This is a love novel set in Uruguay.) Since then, he has been writing diligently, but it was not until more than twenty years later, after the publication of his most famous work, "Green Mansions," that he gradually began to attract attention in the literary world. By 1915, his "Green Mansions" was considered a literary masterpiece, and the famous British writer Galsworthy especially expressed admiration for Hudson. In the preface to the new edition of "Green Mansions," he said: "Of all living writers! Now that Tolstoy is gone! My favorite is Hudson."</p>
<p>Hudson continued to write until shortly before his death. His last work, "A Shepherd's Life," was written on his sickbed and published after his death.</p>
<p>Critics believe that he was most successful when he described nature, and his greatest failure was in the depiction of character. He himself admitted that he was a writer of natural literature rather than a novelist. His keen observation of nature, especially birds, has led to several excellent works. For example, "Birds in England," "Birds in London," "Birds and Man," and "Afoot in England" are all extremely worthy of reading in today's promotion of biological essays.</p>
<p>Hudson's style is considered the most concise and pure in modern British literature, and his works are often used as models in universities for this reason. The famous British writer Conrad said, "Hudson's writing is like the growth of grass. It grows there extremely naturally."</p>
<p>Conrad and Hudson maintained a very friendly relationship throughout their lives. Both expressed respect and admiration for each other's works.</p>
<p>Hudson had an extremely imposing physique. Walking on the streets of London, everyone couldn't help but turn around to look at him. Broad shoulders coupled with a height of six feet three inches, a large head with disheveled hair, a full mouth of short beards, and a pair of hawk-like eyes made him the center of attention at any gathering.</p>
<p>Diligent writing did not bring him the financial rewards he deserved. He died quietly in obscurity on the night of August 2, 1922, without medical treatment or nursing care. He was found quietly lying in bed the next morning. He was 81 years old.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Advocating Walking Exercise <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>Living in this cage-like environment, especially the active and energetic young people of this era, they cannot exercise their instincts or develop their personalities. Therefore, it is a terrible fact that young people with slightly weaker wills cannot overcome the oppressive environment and fall into the abyss of passive pleasure.</p>
<p>At this time and place, when we engage in "walking exercise," we not only benefit in terms of health, but also have a good understanding of maintaining and developing our spirit. Young people, from today onwards, might as well cheer up and try it.</p>
<p>The Indian national leader, Gandhi, during his studies in England, sincerely told us: "The habit of walking exercise combines walking and economy, because it saves car fare and allows one to walk eight to ten miles a day; this habit of long walks kept me from getting sick at all during my entire stay in England, and also gave me a very healthy physique. However, within possible limits, choosing a room that is within a half-hour walk to the office is the best option." This passage is recorded in his autobiography, and we should emulate it.</p>
<p>The British business leader, Paul, although he always has dozens of cars and carriages, does not allow his children to be picked up and dropped off by car every day to school, but still makes them walk back and forth. Seeing the sons of millionaires on the island who cannot separate themselves from cars anytime and anywhere, as if the road is paved with thorns and it is difficult to move an inch, one cannot help but feel inwardly ashamed when hearing the above description!</p>
<p>From various perspectives, the urgent need to promote and advocate "walking exercise" is imperative. A doctor also said this in "Conditions for Longevity": "One should do more physical exercise outdoors, or engage in gardening, or engage in sports. If both cannot be done, walking can be substituted. Usually when going out, one should take less car and walk more, which does not take much time, can replace exercise, and does not cost a penny."</p>
<p>Chinese people's walking habits are not meticulous enough -- crooked posture, loose emotions, wandering and hesitant, at a loss. At this time and place, we should have a great determination to reform it. When we walk, we must have a majestic posture, look forward, and not be timid at all.</p>
<p>Implementing walking exercise should be the most meaningful and valuable thing. It can not only temper our body, but also correct our spirit.</p>

<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>Usually, we only hear about two-purpose sofas and the like, but now there are two-purpose bookshelves. That is, it is a bookshelf that decorates the room during the day, and can be pulled out to be used as a bed at night. In this city where every inch of land is precious, such a dual-purpose item can greatly benefit citizens. We hope that Shanghai can also see such multi-purpose furniture.</p>

<p>Fourteen, the Life of Fighting Heroes</p>
<p>Today, when Qiu Haitang came in, he saw that the martial arts manager was so hospitable, and he misunderstood. He thought that Qiu Haitang was a relative or friend of the martial arts manager, so he deliberately picked on him and made Qiu Haitang an unwitting victim.</p>
<p>Soon, the stage started beating the riot drum, and the backstage suddenly became busy.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang kept smiling and perfunctorily dealing with several colleagues in the martial arts team; he always thought it was very justifiable, but secretly looking at the faces of those people, they all showed a very cold expression, as if they were extremely unhappy with him.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" He wondered as he put on his costume and makeup.</p>
<p>He thought that the feelings of colleagues were the most important, and he must find a way to connect with them slowly. Fortunately, he heard the martial arts manager say that because this theater was performing local plays, there was only one martial arts performance per day, which was not like the old opera theaters. The martial arts team often had to go on stage three or four times, so it must be much less effort.</p>
<p>Who knew that the facts were completely contrary to his ideals.</p>
<p>Grand fights are rarely used in northern theaters, only in a few martial arts plays. Ordinary plays are not very serious. But in Shanghai, this scene is the focal point of interest for most of the audience. No matter which serial opera it is, there must be a grand fight. The adjectives "grand fight" and "gambling" are often advertised very prominently. So, although there is only one fight per day, it is always particularly serious during the performance; the protagonist and supporting actors must fight for at least thirty to forty minutes before they can rest, otherwise many customers will definitely request a refund.

<h3 id="e72">On Huang Guiqiu's Private New Plays <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Lin</p>
<p>In any drama, performing is difficult, but composing is even more difficult. A play that contributes to the world and people's hearts can be called superior; otherwise, any good structure is inferior. Recently, I heard that Huang Guiqiu compiled and performed "A Couple of Heroes in Lu City" and "Empress Jiang." Not only are they completely new, but they can also restore the decadent customs and save the declining atmosphere. They can be called crystallized masterpieces, far beyond the reach of ordinary plays. In "A Couple of Heroes in Lu City," Magistrate Liu died for his country, and Feng Ying was captured and unyielding, showing loyalty; mourning for the body showed filial piety; not being disturbed by the chaos showed chastity; and saving Lu from difficulty showed righteousness. Guiqiu's portrayal of Feng Ying can fully express the spirit of loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness, which is not easy to do. Sometimes disguised and sometimes in hiding, it shows the ultimate in liveliness and flexibility. When she plays the male bandit, she can sing the tone of a young man, which shows that she has a long-standing and profound academic background. Furthermore, in the crying scene, there are Erhuang Daoban, Huilong tune, and a large section of Fan Erhuang, which shows that Guiqiu is good at singing and is not a false reputation. Guiqiu's compilation of this play is not only notable for her own work, but also allows Sheng, Jing, Chou, and Mo to take the stage together, each showing their skills, encompassing a vast range, which is unprecedented.</p>
<p>As for the play "Empress Jiang," Guiqiu plays Empress Jiang, dignified and luxurious, magnificent and majestic, truly worthy of an empress. Enumerating Daji's sins and directly advising King Zhou on his loss of virtue, not only is the tone of voice similar, but also depicts a kind of loyalty to the monarch and love for the country, overflowing in words, which is very commendable. Even when she suffered persecution, she did not resent the king, which shows that she did not lose her gentle and kind attitude, and wrote about Empress Jiang's situation on that day in a thorough manner. In short, Guiqiu's compilation and performance of two new plays involved meticulous management and painstaking efforts. Her contribution to saving the declining customs and decadent atmosphere is immeasurable, and she is truly worthy of a superior play. (Que Chou)</p>

<p>Chaplin's new film after "The Great Dictator": Chaplin is going to shoot a new film. The story was bought from Orson Welles, the writer, director, and self-performer of the film "Citizen Kane." According to Chaplin's original intention, he wanted to invite him to play the leading role in this film, but later all the staff of RKO expressed opposition, and it was abandoned. Now Chaplin has decided to play it himself, but the role he plays is not the leading role, which is different from Chaplin's previous films.</p>
<p>Garbo II: The female star Kirsten Stevenson has been filming in Hollywood for sixteen years. Recently, her appearance has become more and more like Garbo, so fans call her "Garbo II." She is also Swedish. She recently filmed a new film for MGM, and there is a scene in which she is wearing a bathrobe. Although she has been filming for sixteen years, it is still the first time she has ever appeared in a bathrobe!</p>
<p>American films re-screened: Since the fall of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, Hollywood films have been suspended for a long time. Therefore, the European market for American films has been stagnant for almost two years. However, unexpectedly, the major Hollywood film companies have suddenly received orders for renting films from the occupied countries. It is heard that this move has been slightly approved by Hitler.</p>
<p>Singers are busy: The busiest movie star in Hollywood right now is probably the singing star Bing Crosby. Early on, when he was studying at the university, he majored in law, but he was particularly interested in singing at school. Later, he and a like-minded friend formed a song and dance troupe, performed in various places, and broadcast songs on the radio, which was appreciated by the Hollywood film company. Now, he films and broadcasts at the same time, and is so busy that he can hardly spare himself!</p>

<p>Chapter 19: The Evening's Nomad Cavalry Filled the City with Dust</p>
<p>Only Liu Yinying remained silent and did not talk much, and drank the least wine. Xu Jing knew that he must be a little unhappy because of his return, and he did not want to say anything to him in front of everyone, so Xu Jing did not drink much wine either. After a while, Zhang Cangqiu was drunk and fell down. Chen Fei paid the wine bill and helped Xu Jing send Zhang Cangqiu back to the camp. Chai Ying had other business to attend to, so he said goodbye and left. Liu Yinying followed behind Xu Chen and the others, and sent Zhang Cangqiu to the camp. Seeing that the sky was getting late, the two of them also wanted to return to their own camp, so they rode their horses and returned in the evening breeze and moonlight. The moonlight was bright this evening, illuminating the earth, and the green willows along the road were lush, obscuring the moonlight. Where the willows broke off, the silver light was dazzling. The distant mountains were towering, reflecting the bright moon, and also seemed to be covered with white armor and plain robes, many towering warriors, to sweep away demons for the country. The spring breeze blew in gusts, blowing on people's faces. Xu Jing was deeply touched by the current moonlit scenery. He and Liu Yinying rode side by side, and occasionally saw Liu Yinying lowering his head, revealing a look of unhappiness. The sound of horse hooves broke the silence of the air. Xu Jing turned his head and said to Liu Yinying with a smile: "I read the historical record before, Han Xin quietly left Shu because King Han did not use him. Xiao He learned about it and quickly chased him back, asking King Han to reuse him. Xiao He can be said to have known people well. Now that we are gone, Chai Ying has chased us back. Although we expected Wu Sangui to fail, we reluctantly came back because of Chai Ying's friendship, and endured it for the time being to observe the aftermath. But I see that Liu's brother's mood is very bad, and I must be very unwilling in my heart. If I didn't have Zhang's brother's word, I would have left with my brother long ago. (128)</p>
