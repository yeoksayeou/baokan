<p>社評</p>
<h3>生活程度與生產問題</h3>
<p>原人之有生也，因飢逐食，混沌初開，茹毛飲血，燧人氏敎民烹飪，有巢氏築廬居處，生活由是改觀，而出入起居罔有不備矣。顧我人數千年來之民風禮敎，崇尙樸實儉德，生活簡單，民力始節。君子食無求飽，古之明訓，顏回之一簞食，一瓢飲，尊爲師表；如塗有餓莩而廐有肥馬，則不啻指爲率獸而食人，自絕於人類也。此當時之力求通貧富，均苦樂，而以鍛鍊生活相勉勵，彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>我國開化固早，而生活之因陋就簡，則與西方富麗矞皇之物質文明，適得其反，母怪常被視爲東方之謎。觀夫歷代內亂外禍之頻繁以及生產之落後與經濟之枯竭。而民生仍得維持民族賴以繁衍者，未始不可歸功於簡單之生活。蓋生產雖少而消費亦無激增，視西方之增加生產與膨脹消費，其方法縱有不同，而其結果則或無稍異，烏得而忽視哉！</p>
<p>自我國海禁開放，東西文化溝通以還，我國民族之生活程度突呈爲嚴重之經濟問題。在我國低廉之生活程度先則彌補我落後之生產，而今則復支撑企業之高昂成本。蓋一切成本雖高。而唯獨勞力酬報之水準依然低落。今日廠家之能博微利者，皆出自工人頭上，良非虛語。在國外，，我人民之低廉生活程度曾有重大之貢獻，蓋在新大陸或戰地上舉凡造路開礦耕田種種無不著有我低廉生活勞動者之勞績。</p>
<p>無如事過境遷，我低生活之勞動者復被視爲眼中釘，而受盡其他民族之排擠與嫉視。待我人正欲提高生活之際，郤又遭受意外之阻撓而枝節橫生。此我人生活水準究應站在何點，誠感左右爲難而無所適從矣。</p>
<p>今世上最感受低生活痛苦者則莫過於印度民族。大不列顚工業革命之成功乃反映印度民族生活水準之降低，亦屬公開之事實。印度境內工業愈發達，生產愈擴大，而生活水準則愈降低，經濟壓迫則愈嚴重，此生產進步與生活痛苦並駕齊驅，誠屬現代經濟機構最嚴重之缺陷。</p>
<p>近年來我國物質進步與生活痛苦亦成爲正比例，允以上海一隅爲最著。設資本主義國家仍能利用我國之低生活勞動者，則我人之生活壓迫更將不堪忍受。夫物極必反，我人之低廉生活忽又被視爲有害於西方之生活程度，同時，彼等固極盼改善我人之生活，以溝通東西之國際路綫。此爲我人之福音，毫無疑義，蓋在現代文明進步中，我人自不能長此忍受低生活之痛苦，而復須提高生活水準與促進生產效率，並行不悖，始可底於眞正生產之境域。</p>
<p>我人低生活最能影響之對象，自爲美國，蓋兩國間之政治經濟關係將必爲歷史性之保持。以往彼等惡我低生活之勞動者與低生活勞動者所製造之出品，而特高築關稅堡壘或頒移民條例以爲抵制者，今則皆已棄之九霄雲外。良以我人需要彼工業出品甚殷，而彼亦極盼維持遠東之中國市傷，而今日之問題固爲如何實現此交易耳！爲此字面之解答，自極易易，即我人如有購買力或生產力，便得迎刃而解。顧自實際現狀言之，欲得此購買力或生產力必先自提高勞動者之生活程度始，美人之希望如此，英人之呼籲亦正如此。戰後復興程序中之各國生產問題與生活程度行將爲嚴重之轉捩點，白朗脫氏所著之亞美經濟與生活程度文中言之綦詳，我人樂爲之介紹與闡明者，旨在於斯。</p>

<p>塔斯社六日莫斯科電　蘇聯外决兼情報局副局長羅柴夫斯基、在招待外籍記者時稱、「三强會議已使德方手忙脚亂、在大會未召集前、德雷台稱、此决大會決不能舉行、但當大會召集後、德電台復稱、該會議不致有任何結果、並謂六委會之成立、顯示英美代表故意延長大會、雖然、日前大會已在三日中順利結束工作、德電台旣無法自圓其說、乃竟謂大會草草了事、足證絕未討論重要問題、德宣傳者語調一日數變、自相矛盾、可笑孰甚、」</p>
<p>塔斯社六日斯丹埠電　土耳其報紙撰交評蘇英美代表會議結果、太陽電訊報特別着重會議結束時、莫洛托夫發表演講所云、堅信英美援助必能有效、而紅軍軍力不特足以扺抗敵人、且能戰敗敵人兩點之重要性、該報稱、「此種信心、不能視爲毫無根據」、該報指出蘇聯資源之豐富、蘇維埃人民之團結一致、並無德人所臆想之散漫及頽喪之現象、又稱、「俄軍作戰優良、英之接濟軍需品利於蘇聯之戰勢」、</p>

<h3>蘇聯情報局長　駁希特勒演詞</h3>
<p>塔斯社五日莫斯科電　蘇聯情報局局長許赤巴柯夫以一希特勒欺騙德人民為題、評希特勒本月三日之無綫電演講稱、「希特勒藉口發起「冬季接濟運動動十發表演講、但事實上德在一月前即已從事「冬季接濟」運動、關於此事、希特勒於數星期前即已發表「吿民衆書」由是觀之、希特勒之演講與「冬季接濟」運動果毫無關係也然則希勒不得不發表演講之眞正動機果何在耶、緣德法西斯軍在東綫作戰蒙受巨創、尸引起嚴重之驚懼及對希特勒政策之不滿情緒、德民衆巳不信任關於『德軍獲得無比勝利」之謊言、且已逐漸失去對於戰果之信心、「畏懼後方發生事變」此乃希特勒十月三日播昔演講之眞正理由、據吾人所知、希特勒巳被全世界公認為侵略者、此人違反蘇德不侵犯公的、且未經宣戰或提出要求即遽行向蘇聯進攻、因此、事實證明渠確係帝國主義份子及侵略他國領土奢、</p>
<p>查希特企圖以種種方法掩飾其海盜政策、巳非一决、在其演詞中、希特勒克稱、「渠未進攻蘇聯、但渠預料蘇聯將攻德、是以渠不得不進行自衛戰爭、俾可保全歐洲、」關於此點、吾人憶及當希特勒攫取荷·比·挪·波·希·南時、渠亦曾稱各該國係對歐洲之威脅、目為攻德之根據地、查各該國係英之同盟、是以德方尙可利用此點作為藉口、但蘇聯旣未與英結盟、且與德簽有不侵犯公的、而希特勒猶以此為藉口、實屬荒謬已極、無論如何、此次係德攻蘇、而絕非蘇攻德、此種事實極為明顯、盡人皆知之職業騙子及魔術家希特勒、誠無法一手掩盡天下人耳目、</p>
<p>希特勒誣稱、莫洛托夫在柏林時曾要求佔領海峽、征服芬蘭、並侵入保加里亞、但為德方所反對、此種謊言已由蘇方屢次加以吾認、無庸再加聲辯、事實上當莫洛托夫離柏林時、蘇·德·曾發表聯合公報稱、「對於有關蘇、德利益之各項問題、雙方已在互信空氣下交換意見、並成立共同諒解」此項聯合公報之發表、希特勒豈非巳予以同意乎、希特勒自以為世人健忘、而不復憶及此種事實乎、凡此種種、均足證明希特勒係一職業騙子、實際上、希特勒不特企圖在其背信政策上欺瞞世界輿論、即關於德軍此决在東錢之損失、渠亦屢作荒謬之詞、在本月三日演詞中、希特勒自認對蘇聯力量估計之錯誤、但仍發表荒謬絕倫之紅軍損失報吿、據稱「紅軍損失兵士二百五十萬人、大砲一萬二千尊、坦克一萬八千輛、飛機一萬四千架」此種數字、顯蜀不確</p>
<p>事實上、三個月來紅軍死二十三萬人、傷七十二萬、失蹤十七萬八千人、共計一百十二萬八千人、此外並損失坦克七千輛、大砲八千九百尊及飛機五千三百十六架</p>
<p>希特勒對於其本身損失一字不提、此無他、彼懼以眞情吿德民衆耳、良以此種巨大損失一經宣布、則渠以前所作之「勝利」宣傳，必將等於零也、</p>
<p>希特勒旣不願以眞實損失吿人、蘇聯情報局乃不得不代為宣露、二個月來德軍在東綫死傷及被俘人數逾三百萬人、此種損失、的與第一次大戰時德在兩年中之總損失相等、在物力方面、德方損失亦大、在三個月中德方損失坦克一萬一千輛、大砲一萬三千尊飛機九千架、此為事實、不容德方圖賴」</p>
<h3>讀賣新聞評論　希特勒不樂觀</h3>
<p>路透社六日東京電　讀賣新聞批評希特勒最近之演說、謂希特勒對於戰局之進展、顯未懷抱樂觀、而承認德軍雖獲大勝、但蘇聯現漸成為兵工廠云、</p>
<h3>歐戰叢談（八四）　民治陣綫的大本營</h3>
<p>各種物品與服務需要增加，都會生活失常，生活費自然高漲。據勞工部統計，去年九月生活費指數為一百，到今年三月十五日，低薪水階級已增加至百分之零九，中等薪水階級亦巳遞增。譬如在鬧市午餐最不合算。餐費在半年以來巳增加成至兩成半，而消化不良症，也成為大家的通病了。</p>
<p>至於華盛頓的工商業，對於這種繁榮，却是歡迎之不暇。一年以前，聯邦政府的京內公務員薪給支出為每月二二，五八二，九八〇美兀，此後就每月增加五百萬美元。結果所屆，那些花枝招展的女職員們每天午後下差出來，華盛頓鬧市好像紐的五馬路在聖誕節前夜一般熱鬧。所有商店都要增加夥計。截至今年一月間，首都百貨商店的生意巳較去年同時期，增加百分之二十一。在此决歐戰爆發前，新政運動下的華盛頓，已在大興土木。如在一九三八年時，市區新建住家四千二百七十五所。迄至國防工作人員紛至沓來的時候，即去年下半年間，住宅又增加至六千一百五十一所，這種增加數目至今猶然。政府方面且已着手為黑種人改建住宅區六處，俾在市區四周按置四千二百七十五個新家庭，目擬建築新宿舍一所，俾容納一千名女職員。</p>
<p>首都的社交生活和夜生活也多少受了影響。華盛頓的上流社會每受總統府和各國大使館的感應。但各該方面的社交生活，現巳為戰事所轉移，宴會已味同嚼蠟，並且戰爭愈擴大，發給外交團人員請柬也愈費斟酌。</p>
<p>但總統府和各國大使館方面的宴會雖然稍减，別的地方都興旺起來了。新官上任，這是每天不落空的，便有一連串的宴會，海陸軍官出防，也是一個堂而皇之的宴會名目。若在平時，夏天一到，熱浪開始襲來，社交界的重要人物都到鄉間避暑，但今年已不作此奢望了。</p>
<p>外鄉人一多，社交也隨之熱烈起來。仟何人只要穿一件淸潔的襯衫，彷彿就是交際界人物，結果所屆，各旅館的屋頂餐廳和舞廳，時常一片混亂。現代社交中最嘈雜不堪的，莫過於「雞尾酒」會，這種酒會現在空前盛行。</p>
<p>華盛頓的夜總會，規模雖不能與紐的相較，但家家人滿為患。同時各電影院每晚無不滿坑滿谷，坐無隙地。話雖如此，社交生活究竟仍以喬治區及亞力山大一帶為中心。</p>
<p>當年白賚士爵士論及美國沒有首都的時候，意思是說沒有像歐洲一般蒐集全國精華，使自身成為全國政治文化和商業的中心的偉大國都。這種批評，確是不易之論，在當時如此，今日亦然。十年以來，華盛頓給予全國的極大的政治影響，固屬空前未有，同時，政府管理工商業後，大有成為全國金融與商業的中樞之勢，但在文化方面還是望塵莫及。</p>
<p>華盛頓雖然有許多有聲望有才能的詩人作家和大學敎授，如森德堡和麥克萊許等輩，令人欽佩不置，新政對於理想的文化社會，也多所貢獻，但不能說華盛頓已產生了大批的思想家。它的許多偉大的藝術館和圖書館裏果然藏着許多世界藝術和文學偉大作品，但仍舊令人失望，因為這些圖書館和博物院，多半供別個社會的人，來此應用而巳。</p>
<p>撇開一切說，華盛頓依然是個矛盾的都市；城北忽忙栗六，城南優游自在；白人黑人，窮的富的，結為鄰居；夢想者，愛國者，政治家，憤世者，撤謊者，騙子，雜然並處：此外還有正派，有邪派和落伍派。這種光怪陸離的景像，實是城市與鄕村的混合物。</p>
<p>美國人當初建都，曾經取法歐洲各國的楷模。各種建築，如國會大厦，與巴黎的和平宮並無稍異；最高法院巨厦的屋角四周，恰像羅馬的神殿；林肯紀念牌，有羅馬式的圓柱。除了白宮始終為首都美麗絕倫的建築物其餘都是外國作風</p>
<p>然而正因為這個理由，正因為新舊世界的矛盾，華盛頓似乎堪當現在的地位。現政府發表宣言，昭吿世界後，美利堅合衆國巳成為西方文明的護士了。因為所負使命的重大，這座新奇美麗的都市，正是量適當的塲所吧。（完）</p>

<h3>讀書應有筆記（上）</h3>
<p>— 維德</p>
<p>筆記、是讀書最重要最可靠的基礎工夫、筆記、叉是吸收知識和思想的絕妙方法、吸收進來的知識和思想、無論是看書來的、或是聽講來的、都只是糢糊零碎、也都算不得我們自已的束西、自己必須做一番工夫、用自己的語言紀述過、那種知識和思想、方才可算是我們自己的了、</p>
<p>一，讀書筆記的效用</p>
<p>筆記的重要、都知道的、從前趙翼的廿二史剳記、王念孫的讀書雜誌、俞曲園的羣經評議·諸子評議、孫貽讓的扎迻……都不過提筆記工作的擴大而已、所以無論研究什麼學問、筆記總是需要的、曾國藩嘗以自己生平寫字遲鈍、抄錄扎記不多、引為大憾、即如近人蔡元培氏在他的讀書經騐談裏也說、「我的不得法、第二是不能勤筆一、我們為考核書的勤惰計、為吸收思想和知識計、和為發展我們思想的能力計、筆記是一定不可少的、筆記在讀書法中占極重要的地位、而讀書筆記又在筆記中占重要的地位、這裹、目將讀書筆記的效用、分作四次說明、</p>
<p>（一）遺忘的避免　讀完一冊書、不見得完全都記得、必須要能有溫習的機會、方才不會遺忘、一冊書少則數十頁、多則數百頁、如其不做筆記的工夫、等到應用時雖然知道是什麼書、却不知道在那一章那一節、讀書時要是隨手把所得的知識意思筆記下來、有了溫習的機會、就得認眞地把握住那些知識和意思、</p>
<p>（二）檢查的便利　已經讀過的書、後來忽然想起某章某節的重要點、但又不大淸楚、勢須拿出原書看過、如果我們當時記過筆記的話、那只要翻筆記本、就不必再找原書了、人事浩繁、每日應做的工作不知多少、對於已經讀過的書、要重讀複閱、不惟於時間上太不經濟、也是事實上所覺得很累贅的、機械的記憶罷、那更是不可能的事、只要靠着讀書的筆記、很可便利於我們讀後的檢查的、</p>
<p>（三）記憶的幫助　讀書筆記　、可以直接為記憶的幫助、因為讀時已經得到一次印象、再用我們自己的語言　筆記一次、那麽腦中所保存的觀念也就更多一次印象了、所以有人說、筆記是幫助記憶的唯一工具、</p>
<p>（四）思考的校止　我們讀書時、當時總不免有不明瞭或雖明瞭而還有不能完全理解之處、如其把它筆記下來、經過一次整理的工夫、那末所得的知識和思想、就得有系統而正確的了、</p>
<p>二，讀書筆記的方式</p>
<p>讀書筆記的方式大槪有六　（一）抄錄式　抄錄式的筆記「功用很大、譬如、我們談過的文章、常有遺忘的缺憾、要是把它抄錄一遍、可使自己的印象深刻、這是可以相信的、抄錄一遍、抵得上多談十遍或二十遍、梁任公說、</p>
<p>、我們讀一部名著、觀見他徴引伸着舌頭說道、這個人不知有多大記憶力、記得許多不西、這是它的特別天才、我們不能學步了、其實那有這一回事、好記性的人不見得便有智慧、有智慧的人比較的倒是記性不甚好、你所看人的是他發表出來的成果、不知他這成果、原是從餘積寸累、困知勉行得來、大抵一個大學生平日用功、總是有無數小冊子或單紙片、讀書看見一段資料、覺得有用者即刻抄下、（短的抄全文、長的摘要、記書名卷數頁數、）治療漸漸積得豐富、再用眼光來整理分析它、便成一篇名著、這種工作、笨是笨極了、苦是苦可有了、但眞正做學問的人、總離不了這條路、研究動植物的人懶採　標本、說他會有新發明、天下怕沒有這種便宜事、」</p>

<h3>美百萬青年受軍訓　已接近參戰邊沿　遠東政策以援華為中心　美僑決心保持中美貿易　美敎士回國後返滬談美國備戰姿態</h3>
<p>昨據由美國返滬之夫敎十稱、「一百萬靑年、刻正在接受嚴裕之軍事訓練、美國形式上雖尙米牽入戰爭漩渦、實際上衆已走上參戰之路、美國已付下極大之代價、將以最堅强之姿態、應付世界公義幸福、及秩序之破壞者、」</p>
<p>美國青年　對華同情</p>
<p>該美敎七於去年七月挈眷離華歸美國休假、日前隻身返此、擬兼程赴自由中國、從事敎會靑年事工、返華前、因美國務院限制人民赴遠東、護照不易領得、乃不得不先赴馬尼刺、然後候輪來此、渠旅華多年、深知中國民性、去年返　後、極受美國人民歡迎、要求講述在中國所得之經騐、因「平常被請發言者、多為博士碩士之流、久孚衆望、為人歡迎、但一由華返美之人、即無高等學位、其在華所得之經騐、較之碩彥之學識、更為人所歡迎、蓋美國人民對於中國、極富同情、而對於戰時中國之情形、尤亟欲知悉其實在狀况也、</p>
<p>力主參戰　接受軍訓</p>
<p>渠繼稱、「余在美時、每以中國靑年之活動吿人、頗得廣大之崇敬、因美國亦將繼中國之後、執戈奮起、從事衛國戰爭、則經歷戰爭業已叫年之中國、自可為美國所則效、目前美國靑年、極為活潑、不尙空論、注重實際、不論加入任何團體、所要求者、除「行動」外無他物、其服務社會之熱情、良可欽佩、一百萬靑年之接受軍事訓練、可表示美國靑年忠勇為國之決心、在敎會靑年方面、雖對於參戰問題、意見不一、或則主戰、或則非戰此或因格於宗敎信仰、唯一般言之、美國靑年均力主參戰、與中國靑年最初搬護抗建者相同」、</p>
<p>華府態度　極為堅決</p>
<p>至於目前美國參戰之意向、與上决歐戰時不同、據該敎士表示、「上决歐戰、美國人民强而政府柔人民敦促政府參戰、此决則政府强而人民柔、政府領導人民走向戰爭、此乃必然之事實、囚二十年來、美國人民生活舒適、當此危機、其反應可能不致立即强烈、於是政府當局之領導、自屬必要、姑不論前决戰爭與此决戰爭時、政府與人民之態度有何差異、其結果仍為參戰則一、美國已站在世界大戰之門口、此說殆不為過、余深信美國人民對於政府旣定國策、必一致擁護、參戰一事除少數頑固之孤立派外、可無異議、</p>
<p>入伍通告　遍貼街頭</p>
<p>「除」受訓可見之事實外、軍火工業之發達、生產量之增加、足使整個美國、沉浸於火藥氣息之中、益以街道入伍通吿之遍貼、已使每個人民感覺戰爭不可避免、此外政府領袖之怒吼、尸引起廣泛濃厚之國家意識、此一意識之長成、當然為來日作戰時所需之資本、在此種情形下、生成一不可避免之現象、即生活程度之提高、平均計算、目前美國生活程度、巳增高百分之十至十五、最近尤然、汽車價値、因微奢侈稅之故、高出百分之三十、美國富貧現象、素極顯明、而以戰時或戰爭前夕為尤甚、</p>
<p>遠東外交　政策一貫</p>
<p>記者復以美國之遠東政策相詢、渠雖不作正面直接之回答、但曾暗示美國人民之意旨、大有助於美國遠東政策之決定、基本上美國環山外交、以援華制日為中心、但在運用上稍有攷慮耳、「美國人民始終認為當局不應犧牲中國之利益、而使太平洋上得茍安於一時、」渠稱「美日試探性談話、曾一度在美國羣衆心理中、散佈不安之種于、但事實之演展、美日間絕無妥協可言矣、」觀乎日來美奐援華新姿態之展開、財政專家與軍事使命團之先後來華、可知渠霄之不虛、亦更可見美國在緊急時、不惜在遠東作戰之決心、</p>
<p>美國商人　決心留滬</p>
<p>大陸報云、本市密勒氏評論報編輯兼發行人鮑惠爾之子畢爾、前會供職大陸報者、今夏離滬返國、入密蘇里大學續求深造、入校前、訪其姊於台克薩斯州之鵝溪城、並撰文載該城每日太陽報、略謂上海美僑雖從中國　事開始以來、營業已大受限制、但仍決計在可能範圍內、始終留居上海、去年遠東美僑、雖迭有撤退者、然今居上海與近處之美國公民、仍有千餘人、多數非至被迫出境、不致離華、蓋彼等皆有其商業或代表美國各商號、不願放棄其工作或改變生活狀况也、過去四年來、外僑之生活雖不甚愉快、但似無離華返國　、</p>
<p>愛好上海　專心事業</p>
<p>余（畢爾自稱）信美僑愛好上海之一種原因、為此都會之國際性、如美商英文大陸報載有合衆·路透·哈瓦斯·海通·塔斯與同盟等各國通訊社之電訊、上海除被視為柬方最大都會之一外、且為中國廣大內地之入口處、赴遠東游歷者、上海美僑皆曾晤之、自中日戰事發生以還、在華美商業巳受劇烈之阻减、然上海美僑大多數決計在可能範圍內、久留滬上、彼等多數巳因美國撒回僑居東方之婦孺、而與眷屬分離、但覺彼等長此能對中國人民保持任何種商業、即係維繫中美兩國日後貿易關係之基礎、</p>
<h3>烏鎮路橋堍築笆　新閘橋突嚴查</h3>

<p>本市大宗粗細棉紗、均被一般利令智昏投機奸商囤積、頗多長期堆積倉棧、卒因歷時巳久、紗質起變、每有發生霉爛、不堪使用之情形、昨向紗業界探悉、南洋·香港各幫紗商、在本市搜羅之棉紗棧單、現已出貨裝輪運往、待運至當地後、泰半不能上機織用、受損極鉅、已紛電本市出口商行質詢、並要求退貨、惟此項棉紗棧單、係由囤戶堆儲棧房、經過輾轉買賣、出口商行難以負責、現聞南洋·香港各幫客商、因未獲要領、巳挽請當地商會、準備向本市各廠商積極進行交涉、又悉本市各染織廠商及棉紗實銷用戶所購之棉紗棧單、已有發現同樣受害情形、亦在準備交涉步驟、故前途如何、殊難逆料、</p>
<h3>民國創建卅週　全市預知籌慶祝　追念先烈豐功偉績　各級階層莫不感奮</h3>
<p>本月十日為中華民國國慶紀念日、滬市各界民衆、雖以環境特殊、不能鋪張慶典、惟為追念諸先烈推翻帝制、締造民國之豐功偉績、其當時之處境、正與目下相彷彿、當時因各地民衆響應贊助、卒能在荊棘叢中、建立民國、方今全國上下、齊一步驟、在最高領袖領導下、全面抗建、最後勝利之期在望、故對此偉大之國慶紀念、彌感興奮、決於是日全市一律懸旗、並休假一天、以資慶賀、兩租界警務當局、英美法各國使領館、及外商銀行商號、駐泊浦江外艦、為仲賀中國國慶、除循例休假外、均將懸旗致賀、</p>
<p>推行捐助　情緒熱烈</p>
<p>全市民衆除休假懸旗外、更為表揚愛護國家、同情難胞起見、故曾由工商學各團體發起推行節的儲金、救濟難民捐款等四大遝動、各階層之正義人士、對此莫不興奮熱烈響應、連日代收捐款各處及各慈善機關、收到捐款、殊為踴躍、苦力捐助者、亦復不少、由此更足證明全市同胞愛國情緒、不因環境特殊而稍减退，</p>

<h3>各商業銀行創辦　重慶此期存款　按照滬渝滙價升水　月息可合二分左右</h3>
<p>各商業銀行為導引上海游資內移起見、創辦重慶比期存款、今川幫各銀行巳首先辦理、凡由上海委託存入者、按照當日上海滙渝之滙價折合升水、惟每戶最低額為國幣一千元、最高額暫不予以限制、特定</p>
<p>半月為期</p>
<p>以每月之月半月底為存取日期、如欲期前存入亦可、其利息必須於月牛月底起息、存欶利率、每期以重慶比息為準、每半月規定一次、比較上海為高、的合月息二分左石、並以重慶通用國幣計算、例如由上海存入的</p>
<p>七百餘元</p>
<p>連升水折合重慶約一千元、如欲到期日提取本息、或一部或全部均以重慶通用國幣付給、又如欲在重慶以外之城市（指各自山區域而言）取用時、銀行允予開立滙票、惟如欲在上海取用、應按常日重慶滙上海之滙價折合付給、旨在限制內移之資流回上海、自試辦之後、頗收成效、</p>
<h3>佛敎密宗源流　融五社講</h3>
<p>融五講經社第二十二决講經、由沈覺靈君介紹天津王驤陸講佛敎、王君首謂、調和五敎甚不易、而融五則較易、分析融與調和之義甚精、繼復推崇孔子、謂孔子與釋迦雖出世入世不同、而學說最易融通、其要點在認識本性、反求之己、引中庸天命之謂性喜怒哀樂之未發謂之中以證之、又謂子貢言夫子之文章可得而聞、夫子之言性與天道不可得聞、不知性與天道即在文章中、其言如抽繭剝蕉、引人入勝、</p>
<p>無諍始能融和</p>
<p>未後謂凈土宗禪宗密宗同以無諍三昧為歸、無諍始能融和、不論何法、但須認定一宗、篤實修持、勿見異思遷、久之自能人道、聽講者滿座、皆為神往、掌聲雷動、王君退後、楊中一君繼講「佛敎密宗源流考」云、踐形研究佛學三十餘年、再一二籀繹內典三藏之精華、與中國自有之說、頗多證印、余嘗演三極凡品之分合全表、以普攝世界各大宗敎而融通之、</p>
<p>佛敎超乎諸敎</p>
<p>然後知佛敎雖進演自婆羅門、而高超世界各敎之上、迨一變而為耶、再變而為回、天主眞宰、即佛之大自在天、至老莊稱道家、本晢學而非宗敎、一自茅濛見謠、腊改嘉平、秦政求仙、漢武封禪、葛洪抱朴、伯陽參同、留侯辟穀於前（漢初高帝）、道陵演符於後（漢末順帝）、寇謙之旣崇於北（元魏世祖）、陶弘景更顯於南（梁武帝時）、從此丹鼎符籙、並託道家、玄牝谷神、演為神秘、</p>
<p>密宗思想由來</p>
<p>而其五形九咒、遂啓後日之密宗、日本妻木直良氏云、「抱朴子所說之諸鬼神、及其六甲秘咒、即九字眞言、與五岳眞形圖之靈符，並為後世佛敎之密宗所模倣、此可證明其與抱朴之思想接近也」、說見東洋學報卷一、於是龍樹世親、顯空有於天竺、覺腎羅什、傳象法於中華、考龍樹為羅什舊譯、龍樹傳、菩提流支譯順中論作龍勝、唐新譯龍猛見西域記、過去妙雲相佛、亦曰妙雲自在王如來、現跡於初歡喜地、見三寳感應錄、引金剛正智經、大莊嚴三昧經、弘法付法傳、八宗綱要、</p>
<p>顯密八宗開祖</p>
<p>生婆羅門、博通經爾、馬鳴再傳弟子、提婆之師、佛滅七百年、嗣法統為第十四祖、入龍宮齎華嚴經、開鐵塔傳秘密藏、稱顯密八宗之開祖、釋迦牟尼應身佛所說經典為顯敎、昆盧進那法身佛直授秘法為密宗、實傳婆羅門諸神及敎風、經律論三藏外有儀軌藏、其衛口真言、身印契心觀念、身口意三密相應、密宗所傳曼荼羅圖、有金剛胎藏兩部之不同、在印度無別、始自震旦不空惠果之際、善無畏受那爛陀寺達磨掬多之傳而北來、金剛智在錫蘭受龍樹弟子龍智之傳而南來，邂逅於秦、各以其學授不空、</p>
<p>善無畏與達磨</p>
<p>或云達磨掬多即龍智、或云善無畏傳同門金剛智、或云不空還印、重受龍智兩部、以傳惠果、或云善無畏傳惠果、唐玄宗開元四年、善無畏來、傳胎藏界、八年金剛智來、傳金剛部、不空同來、年僅十六、二十九年歸、天寳五年重來、譯經論百十部、百四十三卷、受代宗優渥、一行先從善無畏、更受金剛智灌頂、日本密宗二、不空患果傳空海、號弘法大師、為東密、睿山之台密、則善無畏派、曼荼羅果胎藏而因金剛與東密反、兩部外圓仁傳蘇悉地法為三部、唐後密宗盛行日本、中國僅存瑜伽燄口、明洪武初、禁傳密敎，西藏喇嘛敎、印度運花生所傳、淸末揚文會弟子桂念祖、沙門顯蔭、大勇持松先後留學日本、粵潮王弘願川程宅安赴日本灌頂、近班禪弟子榮增堪布來滬、受法者衆、他日會通東藏兩密者、必有其人、</p>

<p>槍殺日兵</p>
<p>駐守該處鐵絲網口之日本海軍陸戰隊一等兵名池田正治（現年卅歲）、瞥見有兩短衣者亡命飛奔前往、知非善類、乃搶步上前、意圖截住去路、詎匪等見逃命無路、隨拔槍向該日兵轟擊數槍、池田正治不及躱避、致被射中左面·胸脯·肋部等要害、旋即倒地斃命、盜匪卒被逃逸、</p>
<p>傷一路人</p>
<p>同時有一行人名季鍚炳（年二十五歲）、被流彈擊中左胸、不支而踣、嗣經街捕召救護車、載送靶子路上海療養醫院求治、事後日方軍事當局據報、即將貫通蘇州河之各橋樑予以封鎖、一而會同虹口匯司兩捕房警員、在該處一帶斷絕交通、嚴密跴緝匪犯、直至午夜、尙未蕆事、日兵屍體一具、後由日方用屍車載去、至對閉之蘇州河上各橋樑、於十時三十五分許始開放、</p>
<h3>糖食店被擲糞</h3>
<p>法租界敏體尼蔭路十六號（大世界對門）老申成昌茶食糖菓店、於叫日晚上九時、正在顧客盈鬥、爭購月餅熱鬧之際、突來暴客一人、手持紙包一個、向店內拋擲、詎包內盡屬糞汚、該包擲進店堂、紙破汚汁四濺、一時店堂內夥友、身上及所堆貨物上、均沾糞汁、臭氣四溢、顧客爭相奔避、而拋擲之暴客、即反身奔逃、經店夥尾追出外、嗚捕將拋萬者追獲、訊據供出姓名為劉阿一、紹興人、並稱此事係受人出資、一十元嗾使、餘詞支吾、帶入捕房、聽候查究、茲聞此事與公會勞資糾紛涉有關係、捕房方而根據劉犯供詞、派探緝捕主使犯、務獲併案究辦、</p>
<h3>康年藥廠米警</h3>

<h3>西報記者　巡行南市記</h3>
<p>大陸報云、今日之南市、滿目貧困景象、賭風則甚熾、頗可異也、過去半載內、南市先後設有大賭窟六家、沉緬其中者、盈千纍萬、身入其內、但見賭徒麕集、凝神注視賭博之進行、額際汗珠淋漓、厥狀可哂、，賭櫰軟項之出人、恒以千百計、反顧賭窟外往來於莠草叢生之石子路上者、盡是貧苦人民、共裝束多類農民與苦力、</p>
<p>賭業最盛</p>
<p>目下南市最大之營業、首推賭博、决為舊衣鞋店、亦殊繁盛、此等舊貨店、莫不設於賭窟門口、賭徒恒有輸盡現款、即赴舊貨店售共衣衫鞋帽者、肥者會見一衣冠楚楚之華人、忽忽出賭窟而入舊貨店、迅即去履售得六元、跣足逕返賭窟、作孤注之一擲、各賭窟中、賭徒出入、晝夜不絕</p>
<p>賭徒麕集</p>
<p>記者亦信步入內、即有兩女郞曳余袖至賭檯前、檯旁女郞六人方作「二十一點」賭博、堅邀記者參加、記者素不喜此，僅允以五角作賭注、彼等竟掩口失笑、蓋賭注至少一元、尋常恒為五元也、該賭窟中有大賭檯的三十餘、賭徒圍集、記者目覩一肥胖華人、收出十元紙幣一疊、未幾僅剩其半矣、</p>
<p>少女招徠</p>
<p>賭客可免費飮酒吸烟、携兒童前往者、復得水菓與牛乳樓上免費供給中餐西菜、以至吸毒更有少女侍候、以廣招徠、賭客大負、囊中空空者、賭窟備有汽車五六輛送其返家、最盛之賭博為「大小」、賭注出入甚巨、記者見一「大小」賭檯、在一刻鐘內易手之款奚止數萬、粵人喜賭番攤另有一角中、劃定僅許日人賭博、</p>
<p>斷垣殘壁</p>
<p>約一年前、南市尙極荒凉、僅乞丐與極貧困者棲身其中、今則不然、損壞之屋宇中、縱無門窗屋頂者、亦有住戶、斷垣殘壁、仍到處可見、毀於砲火之房屋、重行建造者、寥寥無幾、瓦礫堆中、不啻公厠、臭氣難當、日方於一年前開放南市時、華人為低廉之房租所吸引、紛粉入內、據記者所悉、南市房租、僅及租界內所索者八分之一、且無小租等弊、</p>
<p>城隍廟內</p>
<p>南市交通、全賴人力車、偶見汽車駛過、皆屬日人或賭窟者、南市商店雖不在少、然皆小舖耳、現居南市之殷富華人、恐不出十人、其住宅圍以鐵絲網、並有持械者守衛、城隍廟中往日香燜燎繞、善男信女、頂禮膜拜、而市集中顧客紛雜、繁盛異常、今則廟中市集已杳、僅往日出售珍寳魚烏之處、有少數貧民買賣米麵而巳、佛像前有乞丐數人、或臥地、或捉虱、寂然無聲、</p>
<p>日人稀少</p>
<p>南市街頭不見日兵、蓋已撇退殆盡、所剩少數日兵、皆居鐵絲綱密佈沙袋高築之兵營內、北平與南京等大城中、日人商店林立、但記者在南市巡行四小時、僅見日人商店一二家、所遇日人、不出十人、居民旣係貧苦階級、自不致為匪徒所覬覦、</p>
<p>偷竊敲索</p>
<p>惟小竊多如牛毛、聞現因欺索偷竊而被捕候審者、至少五千人、據南市居民吿記者、彼等租屋、並無小租、但常遇敲索情事、損失不輕、且居南市之每一華人、咸須出資一元四角、領取居住登記證、苟無此證、即遭拘捕、滬戰時逃出南市之華人、所遺屋宇、日人悉加沒收、今以低價出租、三間平屋月租的三十元、</p>
<p>白粉充斥</p>
<p>南市之雅片館為數頗多、僅登記之烟民、始許入內吸食吸白粉則不須領照、白粉為害之烈、十倍於雅片、而南市白粉充斥、吸者不計其數、毒深致死者纍纍、南市近有電影院兩家開設、罕售滿座、因嗜賭者寗流連於賭窟、而居民百分之九十五、衣食且虞不給、遑論常入電影院也、沿浦江之區、禁衆入內、就記者所見、沿江一帶頗形冷落、僅小船數艘、閒泊江邊、</p>
<p>臭蟲極多</p>
<p>而沿江之工廠、多數停閉、南市乞丐無幾、推源其故、或因居民極貧、無力佈施、以致乞丐雖少、臭蟲極多、記者會經世界各地、除在土耳其與羅馬尼亞外、未見臭蟲多如南市者、此决巡行南市、搭人力車兩决、旋訪友寓小坐片談、均被臭蟲叮噬、</p>

<h3>中西股票上漲之程度</h3>
<p>— 秉中</p>
<p>華商股票，在以前，除少數股票有時偶爾聽見幾個行市外，其他類皆默默無聞。就是有幾家大證券號子，多以公債買賣為正業，股票買賣，無非是一宗副業，可做而不做，助有主顧上門，亦待理而不理。可是一切的事情，都是盛衰無常，平時所瞧不起的，或許一時登壇拜將，枯木有生花之日，難道鈍秀才無發跡之時，華商股票的發軔，大有類於此。</p>
<p>為了有錢的人瞧不起錢，幾乎要將所有的錢；變換得越快越好。不要說是股票，即使竹頭木屑，破銅爛鐵，零布斷綫，那一樣不蒙屯戶垂靑呢。所以在這一種心理下，大有除了鈔票不値錢外，其餘都是可貴的柬西。實則鈔票何嘗不値錢，如果不値錢，那裏來的錢。為了去買洋商股票，有時吃着大虧，買進了，價錢立跌，賣出了，又是飛漲，兩面吃耳光的生意，只見傾筐倒篋，麥克麥克的鈔票，流到外國人袋中去。中國辛辛苦苦做來的錢，何必讓他人去揮霍，利櫛不外溢，還是自己買賣華商股票好。</p>
<p>買賣華商股票稱盛的生意，還是近年來的事，最先以買賣華商股票為營業，號召於社會，倒是中國股票公司。其後附和的人多了，買賣盛了，做華商股票生意亦多了。自從毆戰擴大到德蘇戰爭，美國的態度愈形光明磊落，太平洋中風浪，隨時有爆發可能，一般火對於洋商股票的前途，不無多一層考慮。有許多穩健朋友，愛國富翁，以為倒不如買賣華商股票，一樣是發財，何必舍己之田，耘人之田呢！所以近來倒是華商股票，生意比洋商股票為盛。</p>
<p>現在華洋股票巳漲到什麽地步，在平時報紙上只看見漲上去，而不知道所漲究巳多少。因此將各股票成交價與票面價作一個並列比較，再將他的市價在票面上，或票面下，列在下面。所用的行市，本想用十月一日那一天的，後來揀最近的就是星期五—十月三日這一天，如其那一天沒有行市，也許參考到十月一日，二日去。所用的都是成交價，沒有成交價，也許採用買價的。</p>
<p>洋商股票守舊性眞强，—也可說是惰性；中國早巳廢兩改元了，然而他們的股本到如今仍有以銀兩計算，（亦有用英幣計算），然而他們的行市，巳用法幣叫價。所以為便於讀者比較起見，一律將市價表示的法幣，換算為與票面同樣的幣，以便比較。銀兩以七一五合，本無問題；七十元合英鎊，雖低於目前的兌換價，好在折算率有大小，比率終究是差不多的。</p>
<p>至於各種股票的趨勢，己有表在，不加叙述，讀者十覽便知。</p>

<h3>經濟樷談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>屯積（二）</p>
<p>有謂孔門弟子，子貢善貨殖，故曰：「有美玉於斯，韞櫝而藏諸，求善賈而沽諸。」此非屯積居奇而何？余曰：不然，姑不論子貢借喻以問孔子何以有道而不仕，即就字面論，韞櫝而藏美玉，求善價而沽諸，至多為一種居奇行為。然居奇亦有其分寸，已得善價而猶不肯售，則謂之居奇。若待賈而沽，是不欲街玉以求售，與屯積居奇之義有別。蓋屯積為聚集多量之貨物，待賈而獲致非常之大利茲韞玉於匵，無非視為奇珍，鄭重寳藏也。</p>
<p>然則孟子所謂「求龍斷而登之，以左右望，而圖市利，」可得謂之屯積吾？余曰：然，而程度尙有深淺之別。龍同壟）斷者，田野中高起之岡壟。孟子借以喻商人居貨待售，有若登高左右望，何方之價格高，則售於何方，而以圖利。非謂龍斷即屯積也。惟龍斷用於今之交易所市塲，頗為相近，蓋交易所買賣，頗有左右市價之能力，人心以為高則高，低則低，拍板昌踞高臨下，左顧右盼，大有登龍斷而左右望之狀，然此同非孟子當時所謂龍斷也。英文稱壟斷曰Corner，本訓角隅，負隅而不肯售，固與登斷而望相伯仲，何中西文字之用意甚相似。</p>
<p>若是，則范蠡之「治產積居與時逐，」可當今之屯積矣。余曰：霄雖近似，實際亦不若今之屯積之甚，僅商業中平時之存貨也。越王勾踐旣稱霜，范蠡知不可與共處安樂也，因念計然之策，十用其五而越霜，旣以施之國，吾欲施之家。蠡乃乘扁舟，浮江湖，變姓名，至齊國之陶，自稱為朱公，（稱陶朱公以地名及假名並稱也，朱公之名望大，居於陶，遂稱為陶朱公。）以陶處天下之中，諸侯叫通，貨物之所交易也，乃治產積居與時逐，而不責於人。所謂「產」者，生產之謂也，故「治產」與「治生「並稱。然「產之意義為廣，凡財產俱曰產，以財可生產，疊言之曰財產；產可以立業，故叉曰產業。貨物為財產之大部分，言產即包括貨本貨物於內。治者理也，（唐人避高宗諱，凡「治」統作「理」，）治產即料理其貨物也。積居即今言居積，居有存放之義，積有聚集之意，積居與時逐，言豫居貨物與時逐利也。然經營商業，不能不豫居貨物以應一般之需求，故積居不足為屯積解，惟積居而逢高不售，所積之量，又遠過其所銷之應有準備，斯得謂之屯積。至與時逐利，固商業應有之義也。</p>
<p>惟西漢未所謂「貴庾」，庶幾相當於屯積之意。庾者積也，貴庾者，謂所積之物，必待價貴而後售，此非屯積居奇而何。居奇者，以為奇貨可居也；向之買不肯賣，非達其所欲得之目的不出售，貨至於奇，其自視之高可知矣。然則屯積二字，固何自而來也。余以為本於積草屯糧，積草屯糧，本以充軍糈，非為經商，因馬不可無草料，軍不可無糧食，曰屯曰積，所以聚集大宗之糧草，以備用，遂謂有大宗物品聚集而不時售者曰屯積，沿用於商業，即今屯貨居奇之謂也。</p>
<p>滬商稱囤貨曰塌貨，詢以塌者何謂也，曰塌進；即日塌進，亦不足以盡屯之義。蓋屯者必為聚集多量貨物之謂，豈塌進二字所能賅，故其義必另有在。而不知此「塌」之一義，由來已久，明初，京師（其時之京師為南京）軍民居室，皆官所給，比舍無隙地，因之商貨至，或止於舟，或貯城外，駔儈得上下共價，商人病之，太祖乃命於三山諸門外，瀕水為屋，名塌房，以貯商貨。永樂時，遂命於各地置客店塌房。塌房者，即今之貨棧；凡屯貨必貯於棧，稱塌貨，謂為棧房之貨物也。棧房中之貨物，非盡為屯貨，但存棧之貨常為大宗，屯積之貨必多存棧，此屯貨稱為塌貨之由來。今商人只知其然，而不知所以然，故揭而出之。　（完）</p>
<p>經濟業談，原為偶爾補白及調劑讀者目力，故有時發衣一二則，藉助談興。尙幸發刊以來，雖時斷時續，猶得一部分讀者注意。茲以本刊篇幅有限，除「屯積」，上月排成米及發表仍應續刋者外，嗣後不再在本刊發表。况所發表者亦僅鱗半爪，原不足以汚讀者之目，亦恐未足以饜讀者之望；目待將來有全部發表印行之機會，再求讀者作整個之批評，為有興趣。</p>

<h3>栗</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>栗是屬於殼斗科的落葉喬木，幹高四五丈，葉長橢圓形而端尖，儼如箭鏃，邊緣上有尖銳的鋸齒，下面更有白色的絨毛。五月間開單性花，黃白色，雌雄同株；雄花排列成柔荑花序，雌花平常是三朶聚生，外面有一個總苞包裹着，茁生於雄花長穗的基部。果實為堅果，在由總苞發育而成的殼斗內含着。殼斗麼，就是外面長刺巉巉形如刺蝟而叫我們感覺棘手的那個傢伙。果實到秋天成熟時，便努力的把殼斗張裂開跳躍而出，如同一顆小炸彈爆炸一般：大戴禮上所說的「栗零」，東觀書上所說的「栗駭」，便全是指的這種散播種子的現象，也可見古人觀物辦事的細心了。</p>
<p>栗的祖國在那裏呢？這問題不能够，也不需要討論；因為它遠在有史以前，早已就廣佈在亞歐大陸的各處了，—新大陸上也有—更從那裹去追尋這種傳播的痕跡？按我國最可靠的文獻而論：詩經上豳風東山章『有敦瓜苦，烝在粟薪』二句，是公元前十二世紀時周公的著作：左傳莊公二十四年『女贄不過榛栗棗脩』一語，又是公前六七〇年御孫的言辭；至於詩經唐風「山有漆，隰有栗」，鄘風『樹之榛栗』，禮記內則『子事父母，婦事舅姑』，棗栗飴蜜以甘之」，還有周禮儀禮上的等等句子，全可以證明我國人是從多少年以來就知道吃食這「實擬黃金，漿誇白玉」的栗子啊。</p>
<p>栗的歷史旣是這麼古遠，栗的足跡又是那麼廣闊，為什麼現在人慣常喜歡「良鄕栗子」呢？為什麼「良鄕」二字幾乎變成了栗子的代名詞呢？我嘗翻閱我國自古以來的載籍，而願意尋根問底的明瞭它的來源了！結果呢，知道是自從南宋以來纔有這個名稱，前乎此是找不到一點蜘絲馬跡的！且也，以產佳栗著名的城邑很有幾個，有的比良鄉的資格還老得多哩，然而統統受了淘汰以致隱沒不聞了！可見這種無關實際無關緊要的一點點虛名，也似乎有數存乎其間，並非人或物的自身所能為力的（未完）</p>

<h3>最後三個月</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>聽說不久以前，上海映過一齣美國電影，片中的故事講一個患心臟病的人，醫生告訴他說他的壽命祇有三個月好過了。這叫病人又驚又急，以為在這短促的三個月中，應該做一些對社會有益處的事情出來，以免虛度一生。結果他殺了一個危害社會的人。案發以後，被處死刑。</p>
<p>後來據說在一個基督敎大學的夏令會中，有些學生把「假如我祇能再活三個月」，這有趣的題目提出來討論，由大家自由發表意見。結果衆說紛紜。有人同情雷影中那病人的做法，有些人却反對，另外提出他們利用最後三個月的辦法。</p>
<p>如果祇能瑞活三個月，那麼那些最後的日子，當然是很可貴重的。要是我們真能知道我們的死期，那麼我們必定要想法子去好好地利用剩餘的時日，這是人同此心的事可是在多數人不知道自己的生命的終點，然而人生的神妙，也就是在這裏。我們的生命是短促的，而同時却好像沒有盡期。這叫謹愼的人過着警醒的生活，叫懶惰的人過着糊塗的一生。謹愼的人隨時隨地在盡量利用着可貴的人生，在他最後的三個月中，他是無需焦急，無需改變他的人生計劃的。所以最成功的人，在他的最後三個月中，還是過他平常的生活。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>秋怨</h3>
<p>— 白梅</p>
<p>小姐們當心你的前途</p>
<p>當金小姐聳動着她的校長跟他的太太離了婚以後，心裹高興得什麽似的，以為自己將來一定能和校長先生白頭到老了。可不是嗎？靑年會公開結婚的那一天，眞是多麼快樂的一天哪！因為從那天以後，自己就是堂而皇之的校長太太了，雖然以前的校長太太，在離婚之前，曾經找她談過話，吿訴她：以前他們也是由戀愛而結婚的，結婚的時候，他們倆都才從中學畢了業，為了要使丈夫的前途發展，所以自己只好犧牲了大學不讀，把父親所遺留的存款，供給丈夫進大學，自己做了小學敎員，維持她和老母的生活，等到丈夫畢了業，做了幾年事，積了幾個錢，才能開辦現在的學校。如今丈夫的見異思遷，還不是因為有幾個臭錢，為着年老的母親和一個出世不久的嬰孩，校長太太也會　請她站在婦女的立塲上，不要破壞別人的家庭，但金小姐却巧妙的瞞得一乾二凈。「校長太太，你不要弄錯了，我怎能管你們的家事呢？」</p>
<p>時光過得很快，一年·二年·三年，被離棄了校長太太的老母，為了憂鬰而離去人世，孩子也丟了他的媽媽追隨了外祖母。這時被丈夫，老母，愛子，生離死別所剌激的句憐的女人，竟萬念俱灰而清燈古佛與人無愛亦無憎了。</p>
<p>三年中，金小姐，新的校長太太，當然生活得非常愜意。曾經產生過一個愛的結晶品，但不久就死去了，可是如今第二個賣寳又出了世。就在這第二個寶寶出世之前，佼長先生的心，不知怎的又變了，也許另外又有一位小姐佔領了他的心吧！現在的校長太太，心頭發生一種莫名的恐慌，起初因為校長先生的冷淡，常常彼此口角，後來竟然會彼此動武，回想三年以前，金小姐常常失聲痛哭。</p>
<p>幸福，不知什麼時候，悄悄地離開了金小姐，如今伴着她的，只有整天的憂鬱，可是校長却並不因為她的憂鬰而稍稍的回心轉意，倒反變本加厲的和別一位小姐打得火熱，每當夕陽西下，金小姐斜倚欄杆低唱着悲秋曲的時候，却正是校長和别一位小姐在歌台舞榭出入最忙碌的時候。「忍耐着吧！也许他會有回頭的一天。」金小姐常目己　慰着自已。</p>
<p>當第二個孩子出世一個多月的時候，為了一件細小的事情，校長和太太又是一陣大吵鬧。校長終於宣佈了他最後的政策，提出了離婚。金小姐的美夢現在是整個的破碎了，理智啟示着她要和校長辯個明白：「你為什麼要和我離婚？」因為我不愛你了？」「那以前你為什麼又耍愛我呢？」「此一時彼一時啊！」金小姐氣得什麽話也說不出了。「還是乾脆的簽了離婚書，拿着幾千塊錢一走就完事了，何必多囉嗦呢？以前的太太不是很痛快的榜樣嗎？」校長先生更進一步的逼了出來。「等我考慮些時候再說能。」離婚的問題，就在等着金小姐的考慮而暫時擱置。</p>
<p>答應呢！不答應呢？成了金小姐腦海裏的爭奪戰，「以前的太太，」曾幾何時？自己也變成了以前的太太。以前的太太，在離婚之前，是曾經要求過好站在婦女的立場上，不要破壞別人的家庭，如今自己是不是也該去找那位未來的校長太太來談一談呢？「誰管得你們的家事呢？」這想像的回答，使她失去了勇氣。斜倚欄杆唱悲秋，成了金小姐最近幾個月來唯一的消遣。（稿酬助學金）</p>

<h3>黑人肺</h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>人肺的正常顏色是淡紅色，但大城市的居民却是黑肺人呢。達靈頓醫師解剖了許多紐的人的屍體後說，他們的肺像夜色一樣的黑；另有一位醫師說紐的人的肺黑如煤炭。</p>
<p>其實世界上各大城市居民的肺，都不會比紐的人美麗多少的。因為這是現代文明社會帶來的一種不幸，人們要享受物質文明，暫時只能忍受這種不幸。住在任何地方，城市或鄕村，你都可以使自己的良心淸白；但你却無法不吸空氣呀。那麼你只能讓你的肺一天一天的染黑了。</p>
<p>因為在你到戶外行所謂新鮮呼吸時，吸到的却是含滿了病菌和煤烟的惡濁空氣啊。</p>
<p>據密宣瓦基城的勃拉克外爾博士的估計，該城每方英里地方一月中落下的灰塵幾達一百五十噸。一個人只要在這城市住上五年，他的肺就黑如煤炭了。</p>
<p>因為空氣中充滿了烟塵和煤氣，太陽中射出的紫外光綫便受到跋重的影響，嬰兒的健康也因之受影響，竟致非吃鱉魚肝油滋補不可了。</p>
<p>現在僅有的補救辦法是常常到郊外和鄕下去，與住到較高的房屋中去。但對於上海居民這辦法不是夢活嗎？</p>

<h3>無光電炬</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>美國通用電氣公司之工程師，最近發明一種無光」之電炬可使施行燈火管制之城市，不至黯然無光，而同時敵機仍無法察得其光綫。此種電燈，乃三瓦特之氬氣燈，所發出之光綫，僅一燭光，而普通之馬路電燈，則為四千燭光。此種視而不見之光綫，含有紫外光綫，照射在螢光漆上時，始能明亮。倘在路脾上漆以螢光漆，同時以氬氣電燈照之，則路人及汽車駕駛員均可一目瞭然，而飛機則不能見之也。</p>

<h3>日蝕在重慶</h3>
<p>— 澤南</p>
<p>九年二十一日的日蝕，為百年來罕有的現象，故不但為科學上觀察的機會，就是一般市民，也是難得的眼福。日蝕在滬地觀察的情形，巳詳載於各報，茲得陪都友人來函，述及該日在重慶觀察之結果，因摘錄之，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>「九月一一十一日之日蝕觀則，比地於前一日夜尙有徵雨，但至二十一日晨，雲忽展開，在九時至十二時間，日光甚明，雖間有雲遮沒，但尙無碍觀測，因得作一簡單之觀測。結果得日斑數量　個，在蝕甚時日光下溫度低至攝氏二十五度（約合華氏七十七度），至復圓時日光下溫度高至五十五度（華氏一百三十一度）相差竞有三十度之大，每隔五分鐘便可有二三度之升降。至於空氣中之溫度於日蝕前後祇差三度（攝氏。）氣壓之變動甚微，不過〇·三耗而已。」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十三　流浪到上海</p>
<p>這一長篇的說明，果然很有效地除去了秋海棠一大半的心事。</p>
<p>「爸爸眞的，在我跟孟老掌概的起身的時候，就是那個尙老二的神氣也比先前好得多了！」凑玉崑在燃旺一支香烟的時候，梅習終於忍不住挿進了幾句話來。</p>
<p>「這又為什麼啊？」秋海棠的不明白倒是一些不假的，他覺得事情委實太蹊蹺了。</p>
<p>「這就是我做二哥的給你辦事不肯有一些含糊的好處！」他把一支捲烟夾在右手的指縫裏，透着相當得意的神氣說：「尙老二的所以敢那樣胡來，無非為了兩件事：第一，因為他窮，一個人窮透了頂，就免不得要想盡方法弄錢；第二，他祇知道你也是一個吃過戲飯的人，却不知道咱們是玉振班的學生。憑咱們玉振班那麽許多的師兄弟，他能對付得了嗎？所以，老孟動身的一天，我就立刻瞞着你寫了一封信給唐振祥，——就是咱們下一科裏唱老生唱得挺紅的一個，敎他派人去找到尙老二，先送兩百塊錢給他，一面老實吿訴他梅寳的老子是誰，敎他別讓脂油曚了心，往後到處不能吃飯！小唐當日也曾受過我的好處，而且跟你也一起搭過幾决班，接到了信還有不盡心辦的嗎？我一瞧梅寳跟小狗子回來，便知道尙老二那邊已沒有事了。不然，單讓孟老頭兒一個人去，事情能了得那樣快嗎？」</p>
<p>聽了他這一節話，真使秋海棠感激得不知怎樣才好。（二三〇）</p>

<h3>晚禱　四部獨幕劇</h3>
<p>— 直彥</p>
<p>看過朱雷君「為祖國飛行」的讀者，多少有一點印象罷！這本書銷路很不錯，上演的决數也不，少，「晚禱」是他第二個獨幕劇集，近方出版，「晚禱」共有四個獨幕劇：</p>
<p>（一）「馬兜鈴先生課上」是一支新型的喜劇，叙說一個年老慈祥的中學敎員，他反對塡鴨式的强迫敎育，極力在物質條件極度困頓下的學校裏提倡改革，結果便到處碰壁，笑話百出，允以一個神經質的學生跟校長的女兒求婚，而引起校長大發雷霆一塲，作者力事舖張，令人拜倒。</p>
<p>（二）「晚禱」的風格和「為祖國飛行」相像，故事在一個靜穆華麗的畫面上展開：立陶宛新任民政廳長家裏帶進一個待決的革命黨，剛是廳長太太舊日的愛人凱萊，廳長允許他倆有一刻鐘叙面，凱萊很體諒他太太的苦衷，談話間毫無怨懟可是黛妮（廳長太太）却在雙重摯愛鼓勵下，巧妙地換去了迫飮凱萊的毒酒，在凄凉悲壯的晚禱鐘聲裏仰藥而死了。</p>
<p>（三）「米潮」也是一支喜劇，老爺忙着囤積，太太忙着打脾，結果是人財兩空，小少爺倒給綁票綁了去。全劇以代表都市婦人的太太最妙，一面忙着上吊，一面又忙着白板雙碰了</p>
<p>（四）「紅樓二尤」是一個極美的文藝習作，劇本雖經作者指明不能上演，可是在劇情對白上，筆者認為是寫得最成功的</p>
<p>値得宣揚的是作者對劇藝的態度非常嚴肅，他始終留戀着底層的一環，孜孜不倦的工作着，旣沒有登大雅之堂的雄心，更遑論有收獲與吾，所以這幾個戲也完全寫給小劇團的</p>

<h3>上海戲劇學校　演「得意緣」之優點</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>平劇中之家庭倫理戲最多，無處不將夫婦情分曲曲傳出，如老年夫妻戲之靑風亭，能於口角紛爭時互相顧憐；中年夫妻戲之寳蓮燈，於袒護兒女之際，尙能憶及「不要為了兩偭奴才傷了我二老的和氣」；少年夫妻戲之販馬記，寫狀一塲，閨中情况，委婉如畫，尤足令人迴腸盪氣，而最足使人心醉者，厥唯新婚夫妻戲之得意緣，將閨房小兒女情態，刻劃入微，實為不可多得之佳劇，荀慧生小翠花演是劇各擅勝塲，惜二人年華老去，劇藝雖好，以四十許人而扭揑作小兒女態，似巳甚相宜。該劇全部八本，自訪婿起，務農止，須演十六刻之久，全部精彩僅見於敎鏢說陂惡餞下山等數塲，故普通之不演全者均以雌雄鏢名之。日前觀戲校學生之是劇，由張正芳飾狄雲鸞，薛正康飾盧昆杰，一對小夫妻，討人歡喜，張正芳勁之足，可直追慧生。是劇敎鏢一塲，完全對白，其中拜師辯論以「娘兒們與爺兒們一幾段最難上口，一不留神，就要吃螺絲，口齒無勁者不敢輕於嘗試。尙小雲之雌雄鏢曩年以小翠花飾狄雲鸞，近則由芙蓉草担任，荀慧生之得意緣，非芙蓉草之郞霞玉，不能生色。故雲鸞霞玉能兼工者僅桐珊一人耳。是日別母吵家兩塲，空氣最為緊張，顧正秋之一兒呀你呢一一聲，全塲為之動容。張正芳跪禀一段，對於母女天性及夫妻愛情，旣捨不得離開親娘，又捨不得拋撇郞君，婉轉哀啼，悱惻纏綿，令人泫然。小妮子已能做戲，煞是可人。最難能可貴者，自始至終蹂蹻上塲，科班戲之不偷工减料，即此可見一斑。連泉老去，毛世來之蹻工稱雄一時，正芳苟努力精進，五年以後，未許等閒視之矣。顧正秋為戲校之特殊人材，天賦之厚，超出儕輩，其靑衣戲社會人仕巳有相當之嘉許，其飾郎霞玉，對工之至，餞別一塲，十分動人，恰有幾分神似小雲，非一日之功矣。其餘配角，亦稱　整，不佞於觀劇之餘。對於戲校前途，抱有莫大之厚望也。</p>

<h3>Withdrawal from Zhengzhou After Heavily Damaging Japanese Forces; Chinese Troops Launch Fierce Counteroffensive; Japanese Offensive Blunted After Fierce Attacks from Various Chinese Units; Japanese Forces in Hubei Pursued and Gradually Eliminated by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It is reported that after heavily damaging the Japanese forces, the Central Army withdrew from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 4th. The battle was bloody, and the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the Chinese side's communique acknowledges that the Chinese army has abandoned Zhengzhou. It states that the defending forces of Zhengzhou have made an orderly retreat and are holding new positions near Zhengzhou, continuing to engage the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces entered Zhengzhou from the northeast and southeast at noon on Friday. The Chinese rearguard fought the Japanese in street battles within the city for several hours. The strength of the Japanese forces around Zhengzhou is estimated at over 30,000, supported by 100 aircraft and 70-80 tanks. The forces that entered Zhengzhou were from the central Japanese column, and their cost was 2,500 dead and wounded. The losses on the left and right flanks of the Japanese are equal to those of the central column. Currently, the Japanese left flank is being held up at Rongze, a city less than 20 kilometers northwest of Zhengzhou. Their right flank is currently being fiercely fought by the Chinese army southeast of Zhengzhou. There was no new news from the Xiangbei front yesterday, only a short telegram stating that the Chinese army has successfully dealt with the Japanese forces landing north of Xiangyin from Dongting Lake. At the same time, general speculation that the Chinese army was about to launch a major offensive in Yichang seems to have been answered by a semi-official announcement, stating that during the week starting September 27, while the great battle for Changsha was in progress, the Chinese forces in Yichang, Xinyang, and Suixian attacked resolutely to contain the Japanese forces. Now that the Japanese have retreated from Xiangbei, the battles in the aforementioned areas can be considered to have achieved their purpose. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Fierce fighting is taking place in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. The main force of the Japanese troops that broke into the city has been almost completely wiped out. The Chinese army launched a fierce counteroffensive yesterday. The authorities have also mobilized fresh troops stationed in central Shaanxi to rush to the front lines to fight. After the Japanese forces were fiercely counterattacked by various Chinese units yesterday evening, their momentum was blunted and they were unable to advance further. The Chinese army on the western section of the Longhai Railway has completed a pincer encirclement and is now waiting for the Japanese cavalry to stray in and be annihilated. The military authorities here believe that the battle situation in central Henan will develop rapidly within days, and the Chinese army will not allow the Japanese forces to gain an inch anywhere. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) Since September 27, in order to support the Xiangbei operations, the Chinese army has launched offensives in Yichang, Suixian, Xinyang, and other areas, capturing key points and inflicting heavy losses.

On the central route, the Chinese forces and the Japanese forces engaged in a seesaw battle in the areas of Dongxi Hu Hutong, Jibo City, Shuimo Zhou, and Gucheng until the morning of the 4th, killing and wounding a large number of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese forces then added 4,000-5,000 reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on Zhengzhou. At 3:00 PM on the 4th, part of the Japanese forces broke into the northeast corner of Zhengzhou. The Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese forces, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Fierce street fighting is still ongoing. On the right route, the Japanese forces have also been killed and wounded in large numbers by the Chinese army for several days and are still being blocked in the southeastern area of Zhengzhou. The Japanese forces have made no progress. On the left route, the Japanese forces have suffered heavy casualties for several days at Sanggou Wang (northwest of Rongze), Tianzhuang, Sunzhuang, Handong, Tianbo, Xiedong, and other places, and are showing signs of collapse. They urgently added more than 4,000 troops from the north bank, who invaded the southwestern area by rail on the morning of the 4th and are still being blocked by the Chinese army in the Nawang Village (north of Xingze) and Sanggou areas.

The Japanese soldiers had no fighting spirit and fled as soon as they saw the Chinese army. The Chinese army is still pursuing them. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese forces who fled to the Miluo Xiangjiang Xinqiang Guiyi area were pursued and attacked by the Chinese. Moreover, their return route to the north bank was cut off by the Chinese. On the 5th, more than a thousand civilian boats swarmed out of the Miluo River, trying to escape through Heye Lake. They were constantly shelled by the Chinese army along the way, and countless were killed and wounded. Many drowned. There are no more traces of the Japanese on the south bank of the Miluo River. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Changde: The Chinese army in Xiangbei has been intercepting the Japanese who are retreating north from the outskirts of Changsha along the Miluo River for several days, and has achieved considerable gains. The Japanese who broke through the encirclement and fled to the vicinity of Xiangyin were also surrounded by the Chinese army. Although the Japanese dropped dozens of paratroopers to rescue them, they were immediately wiped out by the Chinese. That Japanese force will soon be eliminated. Japanese warships and boats in Hengling Lake still occasionally come and go. Yesterday, they even used aircraft and gunboats to cover motorboats and civilian boats to attack the Alulin Tan area, but were fiercely resisted by the Chinese garrison and the Japanese did not succeed.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders All Schools to Open on Schedule</h3>

Now, in order to take care of students' studies, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to all schools at all levels to open on schedule. For those who have postponed due to any reason, the missed classes should be made up for.

<h3>Standard of Living and Production Problems</h3>
<p>From the very beginning of humankind, driven by hunger, they sought food. In the initial chaos, they ate raw meat and drank blood. Suiren taught people to cook, and Youchao built shelters. Life thus changed, and everything necessary for daily life was prepared. Considering our nation's customs and morals over thousands of years, we have advocated simplicity and frugality. When living is simple, national strength is conserved. "A gentleman does not seek satiety in food" is an ancient maxim. Yan Hui's single basket of food and gourd of water are respected as a teacher's model. If there are starving people on the roads while the stables have fat horses, it is akin to "leading beasts to devour men," cutting oneself off from humanity. This was at that time a vigorous effort to share wealth and poverty, happiness and hardship, and to encourage each other to cultivate simple living. It is all very clear.</p>
<p>Our country's civilization developed early, but the simplification of living stands in stark contrast to the splendid material civilization of the West. No wonder we are often seen as the enigma of the East. Considering the frequency of internal and external disasters throughout history, as well as the backwardness of production and the exhaustion of the economy, the ability of the people to maintain their livelihoods and the nation to thrive can be attributed to a simple life. Although production is low, consumption does not increase drastically. Compared to the West's increasing production and expanding consumption, the methods may be different, but the results may not be very different. How can we ignore this?</p>
<p>Since the opening of our country's sea ban and the communication between Eastern and Western cultures, our nation's standard of living has suddenly presented a serious economic problem. Our country's low standard of living first compensated for our backward production, and now it supports the high costs of enterprises. Although all costs are high, the level of labor compensation remains low. It is no exaggeration to say that today's factories can only make a small profit from the labor of workers. Abroad, our people's low standard of living has made a significant contribution. Whether in the New World or on the battlefields, everything from building roads and mining to farming and planting has been marked by the achievements of our low-cost laborers.</p>
<p>However, as things have changed, our low-wage laborers have been seen as thorns in the side, and have suffered the exclusion and jealousy of other nations. Just as our people are about to improve their lives, they are met with unexpected obstacles and complications. Where should our standard of living stand? We truly feel torn and at a loss.</p>
<p>The nation that suffers the most from a low standard of living in today's world is the Indian people. The success of the British Industrial Revolution reflects the lowering of the Indian people's standard of living, which is a well-known fact. The more developed the industry in India, the more expanded the production, the lower the standard of living, and the more serious the economic oppression. This progress of production and the pain of living go hand in hand, which is truly the most serious defect in the modern economic structure.</p>
<p>In recent years, the material progress and the pain of living in our country have also become directly proportional, and Shanghai is the most obvious example. If capitalist countries can still use our country's low-wage laborers, our people's living oppression will be even more unbearable. When things reach an extreme, they will reverse. Our low standard of living is suddenly seen as harmful to the standard of living in the West. At the same time, they sincerely hope to improve our people's lives to open up international lines between East and West. This is undoubtedly good news for our people. In the progress of modern civilization, our people cannot continue to endure the pain of a low standard of living for long, and we must improve our standard of living and promote production efficiency in parallel, so that we can reach the realm of true production.</p>
<p>The most affected object of our low standard of living is naturally the United States, because the political and economic relationship between the two countries will inevitably be historically maintained. In the past, they hated our low-wage laborers and the products manufactured by low-wage laborers, and specially built high tariff fortresses or issued immigration regulations to resist them, but now they have all been thrown to the winds. The reason is that our people need their industrial products very much, and they also hope to maintain China's market in the Far East, and today's problem is how to realize this transaction! The answer to this question is very easy, that is, if our people have purchasing power or productivity, it will be easily solved. But from the actual situation, in order to obtain this purchasing power or productivity, we must first improve the standard of living of laborers. This is what the Americans hope for, and the British are also calling for it. The problem of production and the standard of living in various countries in the post-war recovery process will be a serious turning point. Mr. Blanc's book "The American Economy and the Standard of Living" describes it in detail. Our goal is to introduce and clarify it.</p>
<h3>End of Anglo-American Military Conference, Radford Flies Back to Singapore, Situation Severe in the Pacific, Philippine Defense Bill to Pass Soon</h3>
<p>United Press International, Manila, 6th – Marshal Radford, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, and his entourage departed by plane this morning for Singapore. The conference held over several days has concluded. U.S. Army authorities deem it extremely satisfactory. Officials state that this conference provided an opportunity to express shared opinions on matters of common interest.</p>
<p>United Press International, Manila, 6th – Air Vice-Marshal Radford, also Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, is scheduled to fly to Singapore today, marking the conclusion of the conference held here. It is widely believed that this conference sufficiently demonstrates that defense leaders from both Britain and the United States recognize the severity of the situation. Since Radford and U.S. Chief Military Representative to Chongqing, Magruder, arrived here, general confidence in the Philippines has increased. It is generally believed that, should war break out, the Philippines will certainly not be abandoned by Britain and the United States. Radford was invited by top defense and political leaders of the U.S. and the Philippines yesterday to lunch together, which drew considerable attention. The "Manila Bulletin" published an editorial yesterday that reflects the views of Americans here, stating, "Since Marshal Radford's arrival, progress has been made in the cooperation and strengthening of Pacific defenses, and all related issues. This cooperation problem does not only represent Britain, Radford himself exceeds the authority of the British Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. He is a policy maker, and his authority is not limited to the British side. The arrival of this senior official is to build our wisdom and confidence."</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 6th – The House Insular Affairs Committee began hearings on the Philippine defense bill today, aiming to reach a decision between $55,000,000 and $59,000,000. Qualified observers claim that, barring unforeseen events, the bill should pass quickly. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Francis B. Sayre, will deliver a speech today on behalf of the Philippine government in favor of the bill. War Department officials will also attend and deliver speeches. The bill has received the full support of both the U.S. and Philippine governments. It is also reported that the current unstable situation in the Pacific is conducive to the early passage of this measure.</p>
<h3>Most U.S. Senators Favor Repealing Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Invites Leaders for Consultation</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 5th – According to informed sources here, a powerful figure in the government stated this month that President Roosevelt is scheduled to convene five senators on the 7th to discuss repealing the Neutrality Act. It is almost certain that three of them favor the immediate repeal of all restrictive measures in the Act. They are likely to be Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, and Republican Senator Austin, all of whom have publicly supported lifting the ban on arming merchant ships and sailing into war zones. However, of the remaining two, Senate Finance Committee Chairman George favors arming merchant ships but opposes sailing into war zones, while Senate Minority Leader McNary opposes any major changes to the current Neutrality Act. Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will also be invited to attend and listen. It is said that he also favors repealing all restrictive measures contained in the Neutrality Act. In short, Roosevelt's proclaimed policy of freedom of the seas is increasingly gaining popular support. It is widely believed that powerful senators in the majority will urge the President to take advantage of this situation to proceed with repealing the Neutrality Act. The sinking of the U.S. oil tanker "White" has further strengthened the position of these senators. However, it seems that the President currently seeks nothing more than the authority to arm merchant ships. According to preliminary Senate voting results, there will likely be about 20 senators opposing any proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act. These individuals may use "delaying" tactics to prevent the Senate from passing the government's proposed amendment, at least delaying the vote for several weeks. Prominent isolationist Senator Nye publicly declared today that the opposition will strongly oppose the government's arming of merchant ships, and will not allow even a partial repeal of neutrality. It is said that the current issue is Congress's policy on the President's order for the fleet to shoot enemy ships upon sight in American waters. This is our retaliation.</p>
<h3>Twenty U.S. Ships to be Armed, Only Three Crew Members Missing from "White"</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, New York, 6th – According to a representative of the U.S. Maritime Commission the day before yesterday, 12 to 20 U.S. ships flying the Panamanian flag and serving the British have already been equipped with cannons. Other ships will also be armed in the same way to navigate war zones.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th – The New Jersey Standard Company received a radio message from Captain Mayrho of the U.S. oil tanker "White" stating that, after the oil tanker was sunk by a torpedo, only three crew members were missing, and 34 were rescued. The ship was 500 miles southeast of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, Brazil, at 1:15 AM on September 27th.</p>
<h3>U.S. Should Uphold Far East Policy, Grew Speaks Upon Return to U.S.</h3>
<p>International News Service, San Francisco, 6th – Former U.S. Minister to Thailand, Grew, arrived here yesterday and will proceed to Washington to report to President Roosevelt and the State Department. In a meeting with reporters, Grew warned the American people not to be deceived by the subtle caution hidden within Japan's policies. He stated that Japan is "determined" to continue promoting its "New Order" movement in East Asia. Therefore, "if the United States wants to maintain its position in the Far East, it must uphold its policies." It is noted that Grew resigned from his post as Minister to Thailand not long after the State Department agreed. Grew stated that certain events detrimental to the United States forced his resignation, thus his resignation is seen as mysterious.</p>
<h3>Netherlands East Indies Official Responds to Ishii, Supplies Must be Shipped to USSR Because of Soviet War Against Germany</h3>
<p>United Press International, Batavia, 6th – Officials yesterday responded to the Japanese government spokesman's claim that the Netherlands East Indies' shipment of rubber to the Soviet Union was an unfriendly act, stating that the shipment of goods from the Netherlands East Indies to the Soviet Union is simply an inevitable result of the Soviet Union's war against Germany. Officials believe that this position will be maintained, even if Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, is correct in his interpretation of the Japanese government's views. Authoritative sources stated that Dutch policy has recently been clearly explained by Gerbrandy in a radio broadcast, stating that although there is no relationship between the Netherlands East Indies and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is the latest victim of Hitler's aggression. Therefore, the Netherlands East Indies' rubber, tin, salt, and other products will be available for use by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 6th – Kokumin Shimbun criticized the Netherlands East Indies today, saying that the Netherlands East Indies' refusal to transport supplies that it refused to ship to Japan to the Soviet Union is "ignoring Japan's friendly attitude and an arrogant response to Ishii's statement."</p>
<h3>Rumors of Naval Battle Off the Coast of Brazil</h3>
<p>United Press International, Brazil, 6th – Passengers arriving here yesterday from Maragogi, a seaport between Pernambuco and Maceió, claimed that recently, under bright moonlight, two ships of unknown nationality and type engaged in a fierce battle for 30 minutes. However, this information could not be verified. One of the two ships was sunk, and the other escaped after releasing a thick smokescreen. Passengers stated that the sounds of the cannons shook the houses and villages there, and there were no survivors landing ashore. However, a spokesman for the Washington Naval Department stated that he had no information about a naval battle occurring off the northern coast of Brazil.</p>
<h3>Wakasugi Arrives in Mexico, Transfers to Washington, Reportedly Carries New Orders from Japanese Government, About to Participate in U.S.-Japan Negotiations</h3>
<p>United Press International, Mexico City, 6th – A six-member Japanese delegation, led by Wakasugi, arrived in Mexico yesterday and will transfer to Washington immediately. Wakasugi is an advisor to Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura. Therefore, it is rumored that the delegation may participate in the recent U.S.-Japan negotiations. Wakasugi arrived in Acapulco on Saturday night aboard the Tatsuta Maru. It is widely believed that he carries new orders directly from Tokyo to the Japanese Embassy in the United States. It is noted that Wakasugi recently made a hurried trip to Tokyo and then hurriedly crossed the Pacific back to the United States.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 6th – The East Asia Association advised the Japanese people yesterday to keep silent on matters concerning foreign policy. The Association recently convened its Second National Congress, attended by 200 people, and passed a resolution stating, "Japan's relations with Europe and the United States are extremely delicate. The Japanese people should not discuss diplomatic relations and should allow the government to handle them." At the same time, the Association declared that Prime Minister Konoe's 1938 remarks on resolving the "China Incident" should be "observed" by the Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Suzuki-Konoe Meeting</h3>

<h3>Mexico to Receive Huge Loan</h3>
<p>International News Service, Mexico City, 6th – The Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that an agreement for the U.S. to lend Mexico $100 million is almost complete. This agreement is related to the issue of Mexico compensating for the U.S. oil properties confiscated several years ago. However, it is solemnly stated that direct negotiations are currently underway with the oil companies. The oil companies have agreed to receive Mexico's interim payment pending the organization of a committee to determine the amount Mexico should compensate. Part of the U.S. loan will be used to stabilize the Mexican currency, making its exchange rate 4.85 pesos per U.S. dollar. Another $30 million will be set aside to open a new Pan American Airlines route between Mexico and Guatemala. The remaining funds will be used to modernize the Mexican army and establish an air force, with the U.S. aircraft factories providing 100 aircraft.</p>

<h3>Iceland's Population Surge</h3>
<p>United Press International, Reykjavik, 6th – Iceland's population has increased significantly since British and American troops were stationed there. Iceland's original population was 120,000, and the number of British and American troops stationed there is about two-thirds of Iceland's original population. Therefore, Iceland's situation has reached unprecedented prosperity. Due to the increase in population and the prosperity of the market, social problems have also arisen. The value of food, clothing, and other items has soared by 150% to 200%. Hotels and houses are fully booked for up to a year. However, Iceland's unemployment problem has been solved as a result. A U.S. Navy officer stationed in Reykjavik told reporters that he waited two weeks after arriving in Iceland to rent a room in a hotel. Many farmers from the nearby Faroe Islands come here to help build roads, finding it more profitable than working in the fields in their hometown. These roads are funded by the British. All stores are full of harvest goods. Icelandic people and military officials stationed in Reykjavik are currently working hard to find a solution to accommodate the remaining 80,000 soldiers who have not yet been housed or have access to basic amenities. Even in Reykjavik, the entire city has only two cinemas, which are usually very crowded, and individual soldiers rarely have the opportunity to enter and watch a movie. There is also only one swimming pool, which can only accommodate a small number of people.</p>

<h3>Southern Ireland Prime Minister Warns People Not to Relax Vigilance</h3>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 6th – Southern Ireland Prime Minister de Valera, speaking at the conclusion of a local defense forces exercise in Mullingar yesterday, warned the people of Southern Ireland not to relax their vigilance because the main battlefield has shifted elsewhere, saying that major powers rarely show consideration for smaller countries in their path of advance. So far, Southern Ireland's major rights have been respected. In my opinion, it should be acknowledged that Britain, the belligerent nation closest to us, has not acted inappropriately at the urging of some propagandists. The Irish people do not want to be dominated by their former masters, nor do they want to be governed by new ones. The only possible path we have chosen is fraught with difficulties. Now that the main battlefield has shifted, the people of Southern Ireland are in danger of acting unwisely or reducing their vigilance. If this danger continues, it is related to our very survival. Vigilance cannot be relaxed, because the war continues and our danger will inevitably increase.</p>
<h3>German Air Force No Longer Maintains Superiority on All Fronts, Monthly Losses Exceed Production, Losses of Aircrew Are Especially Serious</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – Some aviation experts in London, based on the American estimate of 2,500 German aircraft produced monthly and the Soviet claim of shooting down German aircraft on the Eastern Front, have reached a conclusion that the number of aircraft lost by the Germans on all battlefields each month may exceed their monthly production by about 300. British Prime Minister Churchill's mention in the House of Commons last week of the German shortage of aircraft may be evidence of this. The most important question is how long the Germans can withstand this difference between losses and production without seriously hindering the strength of their air force. It is widely believed that the German Air Force's second line, the reserves, is quite large, but a large number of reserves must now be deployed to make up for the difference between their losses and production. If the above figures are correct, then the German Air Force still maintains its full combat strength, but if the current loss rate continues unabated and the reserves are deployed, the Germans will eventually encounter difficulties. The combined aircraft production of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States is about 6,000 aircraft per month. There have been various interpretations of Churchill's mention of the German aircraft shortage in the House of Commons last Tuesday, and newspapers have also published many articles written by British aviation experts. Their opinions can be summarized as follows: since the outbreak of the war, the Germans have used the vast power of their air force to bring various European countries to their knees, but in the Battle of Britain, the British Air Force has proved that the number of German Air Force aircraft is very large, but not all-powerful. Now, Churchill has mentioned for the first time that the number of German aircraft is no longer vast. It would be rash to say that the German Air Force has become greatly weakened. The German Air Force is still strong today, but several points can be considered. The war has spread to the Middle East and the Soviet Union, and the German Air Force must have exhausted its combat capability to the maximum extent. The loss of well-trained pilots and aircrew is more serious than the loss of aircraft. According to the British Air Ministry, the Germans lost 8,020 aircraft in the first two years of the war. In addition, their losses in the Soviet Union have also been very significant. Estimates vary, but it is believed to be at least between 2,500 and 3,000 aircraft. The German Air Force has suffered heavy losses in both manpower and aircraft, and must operate in a vast area to maintain consistency in the war. Now Germany must maintain a 2,000-mile-long line from northern Norway to Poland, while concentrating its main forces on a 1,500-mile-long Soviet front, and must also have fighter planes in the country for protection, and assist the Italian army in Libya, maintain the occupation of Greece and the islands, and continue to attack British ships in the Atlantic. When the war first started, the German Air Force was extremely large, but the magnitude of the duties it currently undertakes is far beyond what was initially expected. Therefore, it is expected that if the Germans lose aircraft and aircrew on the current scale, they will not be able to maintain general air superiority for many more weeks. In short, the Soviet war has degraded both the quality and quantity of the German Air Force, and it is no longer able to maintain superiority simultaneously on all fronts, because the German attack on the Soviet Union has given Britain the opportunity to establish air superiority.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Raids on Britain Have Decreased, British Air Force Attacks Important Military Targets in Italy</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – Dive-bombing attacks by the Germans have greatly decreased recently in the shipping lanes of the North Sea, which are part of the East Coast convoy routes and are known for German submarine activity. A captain who has traveled this route many times stated that dive bombers used to wreak havoc on the East Coast, but they have not been seen much recently. This cannot but be thanks to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 6th – The Middle East Gazette stated that on Friday, the British Air Force bombed an important railway intersection, a mine factory, and an ammunition factory in Marina di Catanzaro, southern Italy, at low altitude. All targets were hit by heavy bombs and severely damaged. A train of supply cars parked at the intersection was also strafed. In addition, the port of Bardia in North Africa and nearby military targets were heavily bombed by British aircraft for three consecutive nights. A squadron of North and South aircraft participated in these bombings and attacked enemy camps near Solum. British fighters repeatedly flew out to reconnoiter or patrol throughout the week, but only encountered enemy aircraft in skirmishes on several occasions, none of which were decisive. Only one of the British aircraft dispatched did not return.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – Last week, the British Air Force shot down three German aircraft in Soviet territory. No British aircraft were lost in the defense of Britain, and four German bombers were shot down. When the British Air Force attacked the Western European front, it shot down 11 enemy fighters. 30 British bombers and fighters were also lost. In the Middle East, four Axis aircraft were destroyed and several others damaged. 13 British aircraft also did not return. The British Navy shot down one enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Anti-German Warfare Breaks Out in Southern Bosnia, Anti-German Elements in Various Places Contact Each Other, German Troops Have Not Succeeded Despite Using Force</h3>
<p>International News Service, New York, 6th – According to a London broadcast received by the National Broadcasting Company here, large-scale resistance against the German army in the occupied territories is taking place in Bosnia and Serbia. Rebellions scattered in various places are rumored to have merged into a war not to be underestimated. Many people on both sides are participating. According to sources in London, the Serbians are now "holding fast and not retreating." Although the German troops are trying to disperse the rebels with aircraft and artillery, they have not succeeded.</p>
<p>Severe Punishment for Norwegian Popular Resistance</p>
<p>Havas, London, 5th – The Norwegian government here has recently decided to reinstate the death penalty for treason. This death penalty may also be applied after the end of the war at a later date, because the government cannot currently exercise its power within Norway.</p>

<p>Klapka Suddenly Executed</p>
<p>Havas, Swiss Capital, 5th – Dr. Klapka, the former mayor of Prague, was sentenced to death by the Prague People's Court on the 2nd of this month and was executed by firing squad in Bohemia and Moravia today. Klapka testified when the Czech Prime Minister Elias was put on trial by the People's Court. It is still questionable whether Elias was executed, as one of Elias's crimes was knowing that Klapka had embezzled two million crowns (Czech currency) of public funds and not interfering. These public funds were related to a relief fund used to assist the families of Czech dignitaries who went to Britain to support the Benes government, or to help them flee to Britain and engage in political activities. When questioned about this, Klapka only admitted to embezzling public funds, but firmly denied using them to assist dignitaries fleeing abroad.</p>
<h3>A Terrifying Act Occurs in Romania</h3>
<p>Reuter, Romanian Capital, 5th - Since Romania declared war on the Soviet Union, terrifying acts have occurred frequently within the country. The authorities have recently captured several hostages in certain cities, intending to execute them as a retaliatory measure when acts of terror occur. All conspiratorial saboteurs and terrorists will be executed within twenty-four hours of their arrest. At the same time, the military authorities have also issued a notice, urging the people to assist the military police in detecting and arresting terrorists and enemy paratroopers, and promising heavy rewards. Families of residents who are killed by paratroopers will be granted five acres of new land by the authorities as compensation.</p>
<h3>The Tyranny of Croatia</h3>

<h3>Disagreement Over British-German Exchange of Wounded Soldiers; Senior Members of Three British Cabinet Departments Meet to Discuss the Matter</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th - There is still disagreement in Berlin regarding the exchange of wounded soldiers. According to the latest news, the repeatedly delayed exchange of wounded soldiers plan will not be implemented until tonight at the earliest. London stated last night that the ships carrying wounded soldiers could not depart before Sunday. Negotiations are still ongoing. On Saturday, the British government issued a final notice to the German government, stating that if the matter was not resolved by Sunday morning, the wounded German soldiers on the ship would have to be moved ashore. However, the wounded soldiers had not yet left the ship yesterday, presumably because Germany had given a response that allowed for a slight extension of this final notice. The back-and-forth communication between Britain and Germany takes a considerable amount of time, which is clearly a factor contributing to the delay. Yesterday, the British Sea, Land, and Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting that lasted a long time. The wounded men on the ship, under the surveillance of armed guards, took walks on the pier. Military personnel here are in constant contact with the Army Department. It has been learned that the executive branch has proposed that some detained German women should be repatriated at the same time as the wounded soldiers, which the British government has agreed to.</p>
<p>Rumor of German Demand for Hess's Release</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 6th - According to usually reliable sources yesterday, Chancellor Hitler is now demanding that Britain release Hess as a condition for the British-German exchange of wounded prisoners of war. It was rumored several days ago that Hess had requested the British government to release him, claiming that he was a German diplomatic envoy and should not be treated as a prisoner of war. This news could not be confirmed by officials, who refused to comment on the matter. It remains unknown to this day what Hess's true purpose was in coming to Britain.</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Southwestern Front for the Red Army Is Improving Daily; Repulsed Romanian Troops and Recaptured More Than Thirty Places; German Troops in Leningrad Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th - A special correspondent for "Pravda" detailed the battle situation, indicating that the situation for the Soviet army in a certain area on the southwestern front is now greatly improved. It is claimed that the continuous counter-attacks by the Soviet army have been quite successful. In the past three days, they have recaptured thirty inhabited areas from the Romanian and German troops. The front line in this decisive war is not fixed on a straight line. The situation in the front-line area in this area is now also greatly improved, as the movement of refugees has come to an end, and activities on the roads and everywhere are indeed adapting to the needs of the war effort. The people in various places are excited to see the large number of enemy soldiers captured. The Romanian troops invading the "B" area have now been cleared out. The staff officers of the Romanian divisions have either been killed or captured, and all the Romanian war equipment has been seized by the Soviet army. The Soviet army also attacked and recovered the "R" village occupied by the German army from the rear and sides. When the Soviet army conquered the "M" village, many Romanian troops were annihilated. In another area, the Soviet army defended a certain bridge to resist a Hungarian regiment, two companies of which have been annihilated by the Soviet army. In another area, the Soviet army advanced twenty miles in thirty-six hours. The German side is now using intensive air raids to try to slow down the Soviet counter-attack, but the Soviet army is still continuing to advance.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th - According to the Leningrad war report received by the Soviet official news agency, the seven-day battle has resulted in the defeat of the German 123rd Division and the 89th Regiment, which suffered heavy losses. The German side first concentrated artillery, tanks, and trucks full of soldiers, and then advanced in formation, but was blocked by the fierce artillery fire of the Soviet side. Although the German planes wanted to bomb the Soviet artillery positions, they were ultimately ineffective, and the German army's attempt to break through the Soviet fire line ultimately failed. The German army attacked repeatedly, and this continued for three days, until the fourth day, when their energy was exhausted. A captured German soldier stated that the German army had to retreat because the losses were too heavy. If they did not retreat, the German side would only have planes and artillery left without infantry. At the same time, "Pravda" published an article by a Soviet navy member, stating that the German army had repeatedly tried to break into the front line of the Soviet army defending the road to Crimea, but had been repulsed. The German army used various methods to try to break through the Soviet line. At one point, they used herds of cattle as a vanguard in an attempt to cover their advance, but the Soviet army was not deceived. They waited until the cattle were two hundred yards away before opening fire and fiercely attacking them. The cattle then turned back and trampled on the German soldiers. The weather there has already turned cold, and a captured German soldier had frozen fingers.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - The troops under the command of Kalitornov fought tenaciously, and after several days of fighting, inflicted heavy blows on the 8th Romanian Cavalry Brigade and the 399th German Infantry Regiment.

Our troops have captured three tanks, twenty artillery pieces, more than thirty machine guns, countless small artillery pieces, automatic rifles, motorcycles, automobiles, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as a large number of other military equipment. The counting of the spoils is still continuing.</p>

<p>International News Service, Berlin, 6th - The High Command announced today that a new attempt by Soviet troops to break through the Leningrad siege line has failed. German long-range artillery is again heavily bombarding industrial targets within this Soviet fortress. It is claimed that the Kirov Military Factory, one of the largest armaments factories in the Soviet Union, has been heavily bombarded, and another important factory has caught fire and burned. At the same time, it is also reported that the German Air Force has inflicted heavy blows on Soviet ammunition factories near Kharkov. Kharkov is an industrial center of Ukraine and has been the target of the Nazi's recent offensive in the region.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - Recent news from the eastern front continues to focus on local counter-attacks by the Soviet army in many places. It is reported that the Soviet army has consolidated its positions on the approaches to Leningrad, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The German army has made no progress. News from Moscow stated that the Soviet side has achieved local victories in the central region. The situation in Ukraine remains very critical. There is no new news about the German advance towards Kursk. The Soviet side also reported that Romanian troops, assisting the Germans in the fighting, have suffered heavy losses. They are now replenishing their own losses with Spanish and Italian planes.</p>

<h3>All Food in the Territory of Ukraine Has Been Plundered by the German Army</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th - In the occupied villages and towns of Ukraine, everything has been plundered by the Germans. In the Nizhnedneprovsk district, a certain fascist team confiscated all food. A group of fascist generals waited by the roadside, and valuable items from passers-by were snatched away. In the village of Brodajiivka, a collective farm woman and her seven-year-old child were executed by fascists because they refused to give a calf to the soldiers. When the electric wire between Kakovka and Triznyie villages was cut, the fascists executed three farmers who passed by that place first.</p>
<h3>Soviet Authorities Encourage Workers to Work Hard and Manufacture Tanks</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - On the evening of the 4th, the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee hosted workers of the Kirov Factory who had won medals.

The Socialist Hero, Tseitlin, Director of the Kirov Factory, and tank designer Kotin, described their meeting with Stalin. They stated that the meeting with Stalin greatly encouraged all the workers of the Kirov Factory, who resolved to strive for new achievements. Tseitlin said, "The order of Stalin, our Kirov Factory workers, will surely complete it! The production of tanks will increase, the strength of the Red Army will increase, and the enemy will be crushed!"</p>
<h3>Germany Claims Soviet Army in the Sea of Azov Region Is Retreating East Under German Pressure</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th - The German news agency transmitted a communique from the Romanian capital stating that the Soviet army is currently retreating east in the Sea of Azov region east of the Dnieper River. Although the Soviet side has a considerable number of soldiers and artillery, their offensive has been repulsed. Romanian mountain troops, in cooperation with German troops, repulsed an enemy attack in a bloody battle in Ukraine. Furthermore, a German news agency report last night, without disclosing the operational area, only stated that during the large-scale offensive on the eastern front, the German Air Force's actions focused on attacking the Soviet rear's military supplies and railways. A total of twenty trains were completely or partially destroyed by bombing, including one train carrying munitions that exploded after being hit. Twenty enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat, and another six enemy planes were also shot down. Many railway lines were blocked by bombs.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Heavily Bombs Soviet Railways to Prevent Soviet Troops from Going to the Front Line for Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet border, 5th - Military observers here recently stated that the German Air Force is now beginning to heavily bomb the Soviet railway network, so that military supplies often cannot be transported to the front by rail. Each bombing involves more than a hundred German bombers, protected by fighter planes. The scale and destructive power are unprecedented. It is speculated that their purpose is to prevent the Red Army at the front from receiving reinforcements and to prevent General Timoshenko's troops from launching a counter-attack in the central region, thereby forcing the remaining troops to retreat eastward. However, whether this plan will succeed is difficult to say at this moment. As for the front-line battles, fierce fighting is taking place everywhere, with the fighting in the Leningrad region and within the Ukraine being the most intense. There is no news about the Red Army's counter-attack in the central region, but it is learned that the German army has sent reinforcements to prepare to deal with the Red Army's offensive with all its strength.</p>
<h3>British Pilots Help in Soviet Battles; New British Planes Parked at Soviet Airfields</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - A reporter from "Izvestia" interviewed British pilots on the Soviet-German front and wrote, "Around the airfield are parked powerful new planes with British markings. The houses in the headquarters are bright and spacious. The commander of the British Air Force told the reporter, 'My pilots came to the Soviet Union and are honored to fight shoulder to shoulder with the courageous Soviet pilots. We are extremely amazed by the excellent airfield facilities, which are first-class buildings, both able to defend against air raids and equipped with super-class equipment. The British pilots, with the help of Soviet pilots in building the initial project, have already shot down twelve German planes, with only one loss on our side.'" The commander concluded, "Not long ago, our pilots needed a certain important instrument, and I asked your pilots to help us complete it in two or three days. Unexpectedly, all of them were prepared the next morning, and the work was extremely beautiful." The commander invited us to visit the dormitories of the British Air Force, with two rooms for the British pilots, one in the hangar and the other near the airfield, with dining rooms, radio stations, lounges, movie theaters, and bathrooms. We visited the team commanded by Major Luke, whose team came from various ports in England. Recently, British warplanes, together with Soviet bombers, went to the enemy's rear. The British Air Force commander told us that German planes were shot down by Luke's pilots. Pilot Chardern shot down three German planes. He said, "I want to strike the German fascists, that is why I came to the Soviet Union. I want to compete with your pilots, the best of your pilots have shot down ten to fifteen German planes each."</p>
<h3>British Naval Minister Alexander Strongly Emphasizes the Importance of Assisting the Soviet Union; Britain Will Unite with the Soviet Union to Achieve Victory; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Painstakingly Criticizes Contradictory German Propaganda</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th - Naval Minister Alexander said in a speech yesterday that assisting the Soviet Union is an urgent matter. We will see that everything that can be done will be done to assist the Soviet Union. Some say that we have not assisted the Soviet Union, but this does not understand the truth. We will continue to assist the Soviet Union and unite with the Soviet Union to achieve the ultimate victory.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Lozovsky, said while hosting foreign reporters, "The Three-Power Conference has thrown the German side into disarray. Before the conference was convened, German radio claimed that this conference could not be held, but after the conference was convened, German radio claimed that the conference would not have any results, and said that the establishment of the Six Committees showed that the British and American representatives deliberately prolonged the conference. Although the conference had successfully completed its work in three days, German radio, unable to justify itself, claimed that the conference was hastily concluded, proving that no important issues were discussed. The tone of German propagandists changes several times a day, contradicting themselves, which is extremely ridiculous."</p>
<p>TASS, Istanbul, 6th - Turkish newspapers commented on the results of the Soviet-British-American conference. "The Sun Telegraph" especially emphasized Molotov's speech at the end of the conference, which stated the importance of firmly believing that British and American aid would be effective and that the military strength of the Red Army would not only be sufficient to resist the enemy but also to defeat the enemy. The newspaper said, "This confidence should not be regarded as baseless." The newspaper pointed out the abundance of Soviet resources, the unity of the Soviet people, and the absence of the dispersion and decadence imagined by the Germans. It also said, "The Russian army fights well, and the British supply of military supplies is beneficial to the Soviet war effort."</p>
<p>American Labor Federation Calls for Aid to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Associated Press, Seattle, 6th - The Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor argued in its annual report yesterday that the United States should sincerely assist the Soviet Union and should recognize the United States and the Soviet Union as friends. The annual report strongly stated that the Soviet Union's alliance with the armies of the democratic countries in this war was not out of its own will, and that its current show of friendship to Britain and the United States was out of necessity, so Britain and the United States should sincerely provide assistance to strengthen its confidence.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Frequent Conflicts Between German and Romanian Soldiers; Germans Plunder Romanian Livestock, Causing Great Famine to the Romanian Army</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 6th - In the camps of the fascist allies, disputes are constant. Hitler's followers openly treat the Romanians with contempt, insulting and plundering them. This can be confirmed by the "special order" issued by the German military department on the 11th. The "order" stated, "Recently, Romanian military authorities have complained that German troops have robbed Romanian troops of livestock. On one occasion, a German officer robbed livestock from a Romanian military camp. Similar incidents have occurred repeatedly, leading to conflicts between German and Romanian troops." German troops plunder Romanian troops' livestock and bread, resulting in great famine for the Romanian troops. The order continued, "German reserve officers and soldiers insult Romanian troops. The rude attitude of German reserve officers has been noticed by the military department." The one who published this order did not do so out of concern for Romania's national prestige. The prestige of the Romanian people has nothing to do with the Germans. The point they fear most is "that the Romanians will not tolerate the brutality of the Germans and will seize the opportunity to retaliate." This is the true relationship between the German fascists and their Romanian allies.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Leaders to Hold Discussions in Athens</h3>
<p>International News Service, New York, 6th - The Columbia Broadcasting Company here received a report from Rome Radio stating that the German and Italian leaders are currently holding discussions in occupied Athens.

<h3>German Envoy to Iran Returns to Sofia</h3>
<p>Havas, Sofia, 5th - The German envoy to Iran, Eidel, together with personnel from the German and Bulgarian embassies in Iran, and several German expatriates, retreated by train to here today. Representatives from the local National Socialist Party branch and the German Embassy welcomed them at the station. After getting off the train, Eidel said that if our group had delayed leaving Iran by ten minutes, we would have been detained by the British and Soviet military authorities and imprisoned in Siberia and India, respectively, along with the 400 German expatriates who were being held as hostages. Bulgarian Chargé d'Affaires Danilov said that the British and Soviet military authorities did not allow Bulgarian expatriates in Iran to leave.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Soviet Paratroopers Landing in Bulgaria Comes to Light; It Was a Trick by the Bulgarian Authorities to Force Soviet Prisoners of War to Fill the Role</h3>
<p>TASS, New York, 6th - According to a correspondent for the American National Broadcasting Company stationed in Turkey, the truth about the previous report of "Russian paratroopers landing in Bulgaria" has come to light. It is claimed that the Russian paratroopers were actually Russian prisoners of war who, under German-Bulgarian intimidation, were sent onto planes and forced to jump and land in Bulgarian territory. The purpose of this trick was to arouse anti-Soviet sentiment among the Bulgarian people and could be used as a pretext for declaring war on the Soviet Union. It is learned that the German side is still continuing to pressure Bulgaria to declare war on the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Soviet Intelligence Chief Refutes Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Moscow TASS dispatch, 5th - The Director of the Soviet Information Bureau, Shcherbakov, in an article titled "Hitler Deceives the German People," commenting on Hitler's radio address on the 3rd of this month, stated: "Hitler used the excuse of launching the 'Winter Relief Campaign' to deliver his speech. However, the truth is that Germany had already been engaged in the 'Winter Relief' movement a month earlier. Regarding this matter, Hitler had already issued a 'Proclamation to the People' several weeks ago. From this perspective, Hitler's speech has absolutely no connection with the 'Winter Relief' movement. What, then, is the real motivation behind Hitler's having to deliver the speech? It is because the German fascist army suffered a crushing defeat on the Eastern Front, causing severe fear and dissatisfaction with Hitler's policies. The German people no longer trust the lies about 'the German army achieving unparalleled victories,' and have gradually lost confidence in the outcome of the war. 'Fear of events happening in the rear' is the real reason for Hitler's broadcast address on October 3rd. As we all know, Hitler has been recognized by the world as an aggressor. This person violated the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact and, without declaring war or making demands, suddenly launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Therefore, the facts prove that he is indeed an imperialist and a person who covets the territory of other countries.</p>
<p>It has been more than once that Hitler has attempted to conceal his piracy policies through various means. In his speech, Hitler claimed, "He did not attack the Soviet Union, but he anticipated that the Soviet Union would attack Germany. Therefore, he had no choice but to wage a war of self-defense to protect Europe." Regarding this point, we recall that when Hitler seized Holland, Belgium, Norway, Poland, and Greece, he also claimed that these countries were a threat to Europe and were bases for attacking Germany. These countries were allies of England, so the German side could still use this as an excuse. However, the Soviet Union neither formed an alliance with England nor signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany, yet Hitler still used this as an excuse, which is extremely absurd. In any case, this time it was Germany attacking the Soviet Union, and definitely not the Soviet Union attacking Germany. This fact is extremely obvious. The professional liar and magician Hitler can never cover up the eyes and ears of all the people in the world with one hand.</p>
<p>Hitler falsely claimed that Molotov, while in Berlin, requested to occupy the straits, conquer Finland, and invade Bulgaria, but was opposed by the German side. The Soviet side has repeatedly denied this lie, and there is no need to argue it further. In fact, when Molotov left Berlin, the Soviet-German joint communiqué stated, "The two sides exchanged views on various issues related to the interests of the Soviet Union and Germany in an atmosphere of mutual trust and reached a common understanding." Did Hitler not agree to the release of this joint communiqué? Does Hitler think that the world is forgetful and no longer remembers these facts? All of this proves that Hitler is a professional liar. In reality, Hitler is not only attempting to deceive world opinion about his treacherous policies, but he also repeatedly makes absurd claims about the German army's losses on the Eastern Front. In his speech on the 3rd of this month, Hitler admitted to misjudging the strength of the Soviet Union, but still released an absurd report on the losses of the Red Army, claiming that "the Red Army lost 2.5 million soldiers, 12,000 artillery pieces, 18,000 tanks, and 14,000 aircraft." This figure is clearly inaccurate.</p>
<p>In fact, in the past three months, the Red Army has suffered 230,000 deaths, 720,000 wounded, and 178,000 missing, totaling 1,128,000 casualties. In addition, it lost 7,000 tanks, 8,900 artillery pieces, and 5,316 aircraft.</p>
<p>Hitler did not mention a word about his own losses. This is because he fears telling the truth to the German people. Because once such huge losses are announced, his previous propaganda about "victory" will amount to nothing.</p>
<p>Since Hitler is unwilling to tell the truth about the losses, the Soviet Information Bureau has no choice but to reveal them on his behalf. In the past two months, the number of German troops killed, wounded, and captured on the Eastern Front has exceeded 3 million. This loss is equivalent to Germany's total losses in two years during World War I. In terms of material resources, the German side has also suffered great losses. In three months, the German side lost 11,000 tanks, 13,000 artillery pieces, and 9,000 aircraft. This is a fact that the German side cannot deny."</p>
<h3>Yomiuri Shimbun Commentary: Hitler Is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters dispatch, 6th - The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized Hitler's recent speech, saying that Hitler clearly does not harbor optimism about the progress of the war situation and admits that although the German army has won great victories, the Soviet Union is gradually becoming an arsenal.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (84) - The Headquarters of the Democratic Front</h3>
<p>The increased demand for various goods and services, the disruption of urban life, and the high cost of living are all natural consequences. According to the statistics of the Department of Labor, the cost-of-living index was 100 last September. By March 15 of this year, it had increased to 0.09 percent for the low-wage class and had also increased for the middle-wage class. For example, having lunch in the city is the most uneconomical. Meal expenses have increased by as much as 25 percent in the past six months, and indigestion has also become a common ailment.</p>
<p>As for Washington's industry and commerce, they are more than happy to welcome this kind of prosperity. A year ago, the federal government's in-city civil servant salary expenditure was $22,582,980 per month, and since then it has increased by $5 million each month. As a result, those beautifully dressed female employees come out after work every afternoon, and the downtown area of Washington is as lively as Fifth Avenue in New York on Christmas Eve. All stores have to hire more clerks. As of January of this year, the business of the capital's department stores had increased by 21 percent compared to the same period last year. Even before the outbreak of the European War, Washington under the New Deal was already undergoing large-scale construction. For example, in 1938, 4,275 new homes were built in the city. By the time the national defense workers flocked in, that is, in the second half of last year, the number of homes had increased to 6,151, and this increase continues to this day. The government has also begun to rebuild six residential areas for black people, so as to place 4,275 new families around the city, and is planning to build a new dormitory to accommodate 1,000 female employees.</p>
<p>The capital's social life and nightlife have also been somewhat affected. Washington's upper class is influenced by the Presidential Palace and the embassies of various countries. However, the social life in these areas has now been shifted by the war. Banquets have become tasteless, and as the war expands, issuing invitations to diplomatic corps personnel becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>However, although banquets at the Presidential Palace and the embassies of various countries have decreased slightly, things are thriving elsewhere. New officials take office every day, and there is a series of banquets. Military officers leaving for duty is also a legitimate reason for a banquet. Normally, when summer arrives and the heat wave begins, important figures in the social circle go to the countryside to escape the heat, but this year they will not make this extravagant wish.</p>
<p>With the increase in the number of out-of-towners, social life has also become more lively. Anyone who wears a clean shirt seems to be a figure in the social world. As a result, the rooftop restaurants and dance halls of various hotels are often in chaos. The most noisy and unbearable of modern social gatherings is the "cocktail" party, which is now unprecedentedly popular.</p>
<p>Although the scale of Washington's nightclubs cannot be compared with those in New York, every one of them is packed. At the same time, every movie theater is full of people every night, with no empty seats. That being said, social life is still centered around the Georgetown and Alexandria areas.</p>
<p>When Sir Bryce talked about the United States not having a capital, he meant that it did not have a great capital like those in Europe, which collected the essence of the whole country and made itself the center of the country's politics, culture, and commerce. This criticism is indeed an undeniable truth, both at that time and today. For the past ten years, Washington's great political influence on the country has been unprecedented. At the same time, with the government managing industry and commerce, it has the potential to become the center of the country's finance and commerce, but it is still far behind in terms of culture.</p>
<p>Although Washington has many prestigious and talented poets, writers, and university professors, such as Sandburg and MacLeish, who are admirable, and the New Deal has also made many contributions to an ideal cultural society, it cannot be said that Washington has produced a large number of thinkers. Its many great art galleries and libraries do contain many great works of world art and literature, but they are still disappointing because these libraries and museums are mostly for people from other societies to come here and use.</p>
<p>Putting everything aside, Washington is still a contradictory city; the north side is bustling and hurried, while the south side is leisurely and carefree; white people and black people, rich people and poor people, live as neighbors; dreamers, patriots, politicians, cynics, liars, and swindlers live together. In addition, there are the decent, the evil, and the outdated. This strange and bizarre scene is actually a mixture of city and country.</p>
<p>When the Americans first built their capital, they took the model of various European countries. Various buildings, such as the Capitol Building, are not much different from the Palace of Peace in Paris; the corners of the Supreme Court Building are just like the temples of Rome; and the Lincoln Memorial has Roman-style columns. Except for the White House, which has always been the most beautiful building in the capital, the rest are all foreign styles.</p>
<p>However, precisely because of this reason, precisely because of the contradiction between the old and the new worlds, Washington seems to be worthy of its current position. After the current government issued a declaration announcing to the world, the United States of America has become the nurse of Western civilization. Because of the importance of the mission it bears, this new and beautiful city is indeed a very suitable place. (The End)</p>

<h3>Second Act of Scholarship Charity Basketball Game: Shanghai Stars and Paramount Tie, Each Scoring 40 Points; Rescheduled Due to Darkness; Performance: South China Defeats Tongren 55-26</h3>
<p>The charity basketball game was held at the Paramount Ballroom yesterday afternoon. In the opening performance, South China defeated Tongren 55-26. In the Paramount vs. Shanghai Stars game, the two sides fought hard to a tie. When time ran out, each had 40 points. Unfortunately, due to darkness, the game could not continue and was rescheduled. When the statutory time arrived, Liu Fuji of South China first scored a bullseye, and Jiang Shuliang of Tongren immediately returned the favor. Liu Fuji of South China had good luck and scored three consecutive goals. Shen Dashi made a contribution and added a goal. South China was at its peak and was momentarily noisy. Only Jiang Shuliang of Tongren was slightly active. In the first half, South China took the lead 21-12. Amidst the sound of the restart of the battle, Tongren fell into decline. The sound of Liu Fushan and his brother breaking through the basket of South China was endless. As a result, South China defeated Tongren 55-26. As the finale began, Shanghai Stars sent out Xue Chong, Yun Ming, Jin Xuan, Qin Ming, and Guolao, while Paramount sent out Shaoqing, Xianglong, Xiaojia, Dazhen, Jinghu, and Wang Hu. Xue Chong of Shanghai Stars made a long shot and returned with success. Shaoqing still got a goal back. Xianglong shouted and gathered the heroes. He scored a second time. Shanghai Stars called a timeout to temporarily reduce its sharpness. Zheng Qinming found a new life and skillfully hit the net. Xue Chong added the finishing touch, making it 8-15. Paramount took the lead. Wang Jinghu passed through the barriers and easily passed to Shaoqing, who made another contribution. In the first half, Paramount defeated Shanghai Stars 23-16. Changing places to fight again, Shanghai Stars worked hard to strengthen its defense line. Zhang Jinxuan was replaced by Yu Yuzi, and sure enough, the situation improved. Yuzi scored a goal single-handedly, which was a great achievement. After a long period of chaos on both sides, Lu Dazhen of Paramount committed four fouls and was sent off. Shanghai Stars took the opportunity to counterattack. Liang Yunming was agile and scored two consecutive goals. Shanghai Stars was only one point behind at 39-40. Xianglong fouled, and Guorong took the penalty, and sure enough, he lived up to expectations and tied the score at 40 each. When time ran out, the game could not continue due to the dark weather.

<p>Academic Lectures</p>
<h3>Reading Should Include Taking Notes (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Weide</p>
<p>Note-taking is the most important and reliable basic skill for reading. Note-taking is also a wonderful method for absorbing knowledge and ideas. The knowledge and ideas that are absorbed, whether from reading or listening to lectures, are only vague and fragmented, and cannot be considered our own. We must make an effort to record them in our own words. Only then can that knowledge and those ideas be considered our own.</p>
<p>1.  The Effectiveness of Reading Notes</p>
<p>The importance of note-taking is well known. In the past, Zhao Yi's "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories," Wang Niansun's "Reading Magazine," Yu Quyuan's "Commentaries on the Classics" and "Commentaries on the Philosophers," and Sun Yirang's "Zha Yi"... were all just expansions of the note-taking process. Therefore, note-taking is always necessary, no matter what subject one is studying. Zeng Guofan once lamented that he wrote slowly and did not take many notes, which he considered a great regret. Even in modern times, Cai Yuanpei said in his "Talks on Reading Experiences," "My ineffectiveness lies in not being diligent in writing." Whether for examining the diligence of reading, for absorbing thoughts and knowledge, or for developing our ability to think, note-taking is absolutely indispensable. Note-taking occupies a very important position in the art of reading, and reading notes occupy an important position in note-taking. Here, I will divide the effectiveness of reading notes into four points for explanation:</p>
<p>(1) Avoiding Forgetting: After reading a book, one does not necessarily remember everything. There must be an opportunity to review so as not to forget. A book can have dozens of pages or hundreds of pages. If one does not take notes, when it comes time to apply the knowledge, although one knows which book it is, one does not know which chapter or section. When reading, if one jots down the knowledge and ideas one has gained, and then has the opportunity to review, one must earnestly grasp that knowledge and those ideas.</p>
<p>(2) Facilitating Review: After reading a book, one may suddenly remember an important point in a certain chapter or section, but it is not very clear. One must take out the original book to review it. If we had taken notes at the time, we would only need to flip through the notebook and would not need to find the original book again. People's affairs are vast, and one does not know how much work one should do each day. To reread and review books that have already been read is not only too uneconomical in terms of time, but also feels very cumbersome in practice. Mechanical memorization is even more impossible. We can rely on reading notes to make it easier for us to review after reading.</p>
<p>(3) Assisting Memory: Reading notes can directly assist memory. Because one has already gained an impression when reading, and then writes notes in one's own words, the concept preserved in the mind has one more impression. Therefore, some people say that note-taking is the only tool to help memory.</p>
<p>(4) Correcting Thinking: When we read, we inevitably have points that are unclear or, although clear, not fully understood. If we jot them down, and then go through the effort of organizing them, the knowledge and ideas we gain will be systematic and correct.</p>
<p>2. The Methods of Reading Notes</p>
<p>There are roughly six methods of reading notes: (1) Copying: Copying notes is very useful. For example, we often have the regret of forgetting the articles we have discussed. If we copy them once, we can make our impression deeper. This is believable. Copying once is equivalent to discussing ten or twenty times. Liang Rengong said,</p>
<p>"When we read a famous book, we see him quoting and stretching his tongue and saying, 'This person doesn't know how much memory he has, he remembers so many things.' This is his special talent, we can't imitate it. In fact, that's not the case at all. People with good memories don't necessarily have wisdom, and people with wisdom comparatively have not very good memories. What you see is the result he has published, you don't know that this result originally came from accumulating inches and inches, and knowing and doing it diligently. Generally, a college student always has countless small booklets or single pieces of paper. When he reads a book and sees a piece of information that he finds useful, he immediately copies it down (the short ones copy the full text, the long ones summarize, and record the book title, volume number, and page number). Gradually, he accumulates a wealth of information, and then uses his eyes to organize and analyze it, and it becomes a famous work. This work is extremely stupid and extremely bitter, but people who truly do scholarship cannot leave this path. People who study animals and plants are too lazy to collect specimens, saying that he will have new inventions, I'm afraid there is no such cheap thing in the world."</p>

<h3>U.S. Millions of Youths Receive Military Training Already Approaching the Brink of War Far East Policy Centered on Aiding China U.S. Nationals Determined to Maintain Sino-U.S. Trade U.S. Missionaries Return to Shanghai After Returning Home to Discuss U.S. Wartime Preparations</h3>
<p>According to a U.S. missionary who returned to Shanghai yesterday, "One million young people are currently undergoing rigorous military training. Although the United States has not formally been drawn into the vortex of war, it has actually embarked on the path to war. The United States has paid an extremely high price and will deal with those who destroy world justice, happiness, and order with the strongest posture."</p>
<p>U.S. Youth Sympathetic to China</p>
<p>The American missionary left China with his family last July to return to the United States for vacation. He recently returned alone, intending to travel to Free China to engage in church youth work. Before returning to China, because the U.S. State Department restricted people from going to the Far East, it was not easy to obtain a passport. Therefore, he had to go to Manila first and then wait for a ship to come here. He has been in China for many years and knows the Chinese national character well. After returning to the United States last year, he was very popular with the American people, who asked him to talk about his experiences in China. "Usually, those who are invited to speak are mostly doctors and masters, who have long enjoyed public expectations and are welcomed. However, someone who has just returned to the U.S. from China, even without a higher degree, his experiences in China are more welcomed than the knowledge of scholars. This is because the American people are very sympathetic to China, and are particularly eager to know the actual situation of China during the war."</p>
<p>Advocates for War and Accepts Military Training</p>
<p>He continued, "When I was in the United States, I often told people about the activities of Chinese youth, which gained widespread respect. Because the United States will also follow in China's footsteps, taking up arms and rising up to engage in a war to defend the country, China, which has already experienced war for four years, can naturally be a model for the United States. Currently, American youth are very active, do not value empty talk, and pay attention to practicality. No matter what group they join, what they ask for is nothing other than 'action.' Their enthusiasm for serving society is admirable. The acceptance of military training by one million young people can show the determination of American youth to be loyal and brave for the country. In the area of church youth, although there are different opinions on the issue of participating in the war, some advocate for war and some are against war, perhaps due to religious beliefs, generally speaking, American youth mostly advocate for war, which is the same as the initial mobilization and construction of Chinese youth."</p>
<p>Washington's Attitude Extremely Firm</p>
<p>As for the current intention of the United States to participate in the war, it is different from the previous European War. According to the missionary, "In the previous European War, the American people were strong and the government was soft, with the people urging the government to participate in the war. This time, the government is strong and the people are soft, with the government leading the people to war. This is an inevitable fact. Because the American people have lived comfortably for the past twenty years, their reaction may not be immediately strong in this crisis. Therefore, the leadership of the government authorities is naturally necessary. Regardless of the difference in the attitudes of the government and the people during the previous war and this war, the result is still participation in the war. It is no exaggeration to say that the United States is standing at the door of the world war. I firmly believe that the American people will unanimously support the government's established national policy. Except for a few stubborn isolationists, there can be no disagreement about participating in the war."</p>
<p>Enlistment Notices Posted All Over the Streets</p>
<p>"In addition to the visible fact of training, the development of the military industry and the increase in production make the entire United States immersed in the atmosphere of gunpowder. The posting of enlistment notices on the streets has made every person feel that war is unavoidable. In addition, the roar of government leaders has aroused a broad and strong sense of national consciousness. The growth of this consciousness is of course the capital needed for future warfare. Under this circumstance, an inevitable phenomenon is generated, that is, the increase in the standard of living. On average, the current standard of living in the United States has increased by 10% to 15%, especially recently. The value of automobiles is 30% higher due to luxury taxes. The phenomenon of wealth and poverty in the United States has always been very obvious, especially during wartime or on the eve of war."</p>
<p>Far East Diplomacy Consistent Policy</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the United States' Far East policy, he did not give a direct answer, but he implied that the will of the American people greatly contributed to the determination of the United States' Far East policy. Basically, the United States' diplomacy revolves around aiding China and containing Japan, but there are some considerations in its application. "The American people have always believed that the authorities should not sacrifice China's interests in order to obtain temporary peace in the Pacific," he said. "The exploratory talks between the U.S. and Japan once scattered seeds of unease in the minds of the American masses, but in fact, there is absolutely no compromise between the U.S. and Japan." Judging from the recent unfolding of the U.S.'s new attitude of aiding China, and the successive visits of financial experts and military missions to China, it can be seen that his words are not false, and it is even more evident that the United States is determined to fight in the Far East in times of emergency.</p>
<p>American Merchants Determined to Stay in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that Bill, the son of J.B. Powell, the editor and publisher of the China Weekly Review in this city, who previously worked for the Continental Daily, left Shanghai this summer to return to the United States to continue his studies at the University of Missouri. Before entering school, he visited his sister in Goose Creek City, Texas, and wrote an article in the city's Daily Sun, stating that although the business of American nationals in Shanghai has been greatly restricted since the beginning of the China incident, they are still determined to remain in Shanghai to the greatest extent possible. Although there have been repeated evacuations of American nationals in the Far East last year, there are still more than a thousand American citizens living in Shanghai and nearby areas. Most of them will not leave China unless they are forced to leave, because they all have their businesses or represent various American companies and are unwilling to give up their work or change their lives. Although the lives of foreigners have not been very pleasant in the past four years, it does not seem that they will leave China and return home.</p>
<p>Loves Shanghai and Concentrates on His Career</p>
<p>I (Bill said) believe that one reason why American nationals love Shanghai is the city's international nature. For example, the American-owned English-language Continental Daily carries news from various news agencies, including Associated Press, Reuters, Havas, Haitong, TASS, and Allied. In addition to being regarded as one of the largest metropolises in the East, Shanghai is also the gateway to China's vast interior. American nationals in Shanghai have met those who travel to the Far East. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, American businesses in China have been severely hampered. However, the majority of American nationals in Shanghai are determined to stay in Shanghai as long as possible. Most of them have been separated from their families because the United States withdrew women and children residing in the East, but they feel that as long as they can maintain any kind of business with the Chinese people, it will be the foundation for maintaining future trade relations between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>Building Fences at the Ends of Wuzhen Road Bridge Tight Security Checks on New Zhapu Road Bridge</h3>
<p>After the demolition of the bridge on Wuzhen Road that connects to Zhabei in the middle section of New Zhapu Road, fences have been built at both ends of the bridge to prevent accidents. The New Zhapu Road Bridge is still open as usual, and there is a constant stream of pedestrians. Starting yesterday, Japanese soldiers at the north end of the bridge suddenly tightened security checks on pedestrians entering and exiting. Those carrying paper packages were required to open them for inspection. This tense atmosphere did not dissipate until late at night.</p>
<h3>Mold and Rotting Cotton Yarn and Machinery Port Traders Demand Returns Stored for Long Periods, Yarn Quality Changes Many Cannot Be Used for Weaving After Delivery</h3>
<p>Large quantities of coarse and fine cotton yarn in this city are hoarded by speculative merchants who are blinded by profit, and much of it has been stored in warehouses for a long time. As a result, the quality of the yarn has changed over time, and it often becomes moldy and unusable. Yesterday, it was learned from the yarn industry that the cotton yarn warehouse receipts collected in this city by yarn merchants from Nanyang and Hong Kong have now been shipped out. After they are transported to their destinations, most of them cannot be used for weaving, resulting in huge losses. They have sent telegrams to export firms in this city to inquire and demand returns. However, these cotton yarn warehouse receipts are stored in warehouses by hoarders and sold through many intermediaries, so export firms are unable to take responsibility. It is now heard that merchants from Nanyang and Hong Kong have sought assistance from local chambers of commerce and are preparing to actively negotiate with various manufacturers in this city. It is also learned that dyeing and weaving manufacturers and cotton yarn end-users in this city who have purchased cotton yarn warehouse receipts have also discovered similar damage and are also preparing to negotiate. Therefore, it is difficult to predict what the future holds.</p>
<h3>30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic Preparations for Celebrations Throughout the City Remembrance of the Meritorious Deeds of the Martyrs All Levels of Society are Inspired</h3>
<p>October 10th of this month is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Although the people of Shanghai cannot hold extravagant celebrations due to the special environment, they remember the meritorious deeds of the martyrs who overthrew the imperial system and established the Republic. Their situation at that time was similar to the current situation. At that time, the Republic was established in the midst of thorns because the people of various places responded and supported it. Today, the whole country is united, taking steps under the leadership of the supreme leader to comprehensively resist and build. The date of final victory is in sight, so they feel excited about this great National Day commemoration and have decided to fly flags throughout the city and take a day off to celebrate. The police authorities of the two concessions, the consulates of Britain, the United States, and France, and foreign banks and businesses, and foreign warships stationed in the Huangpu River will all fly flags in addition to taking the usual holiday to celebrate the Chinese National Day.</p>
<p>Promoting Donations Enthusiastic Mood</p>
<p>In addition to taking holidays and flying flags, the people of the city are also promoting four major movements to express their love for the country and sympathy for the refugees, including thrift savings and refugee relief donations, initiated by various industry, commerce, and academic groups. Righteous people from all walks of life are excited and enthusiastically responding to this. Donation collection points and charitable organizations have received donations very enthusiastically in recent days. Many laborers have also made donations. This further proves that the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the city has not diminished due to the special environment.</p>
<p>Issuance of National Day Commemorative Stamps The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that October 10th of this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The Bureau has been ordered to issue stamps with the words "30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China" and "October 10, 30th Year" to mark the celebration. The types are as follows: (1) Sun Yat-sen Portrait Stamps, with six denominations: 2 cents, 8 cents, 10 cents, 16 cents, 30 cents, and 1 yuan; (2) Martyr Portrait Stamps, with four denominations: 1 cent, 4 cents, 21 cents, and 28 cents. The above commemorative stamps will be sold at all post offices from Double Tenth Day for a period of one month. From the date of termination of sale until the end of this year, they can still be used normally. Starting from January 1st of next year, they will be abolished and will no longer be used. However, if the public has any remaining stamps at that time, they will be allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices within six months after the abolition. The stamp sales office on the third floor of the Bureau will be open as usual from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the morning of the 10th to sell these commemorative stamps.</p>
<p>Democratic Radio Station Celebration Program</p>

<h3>Taikoo Two Rounds Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 27th of last month, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload cargo. In the evening, there was a sudden accident in the head cabin, causing part of the carpets in the cabin to be destroyed. The remaining cargo was flooded during the firefighting. The wheel was ordered to be driven to the Puxi Lan Yanzong dock the next day, and all the damaged goods were unloaded onto the stack. Now it has started to handle sea damage and other matters, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the wheel is also temporarily suspended due to the handling of sea damage matters. Another Beihai wheel came to Shanghai from Nanhua the day before yesterday (4th). When it sailed to the Copper Sand sea outside the Wusongkou, the ship's body ran aground on a shoal for some reason. The shipowner tried to pull it out and came to Shanghai. The ship's body was slightly damaged, so after entering the port, it was first docked on the Puzhong surface of Zhanghuabang, and then moved to the Lan Yanzong dock in Pudong by order of the company. Yesterday, it began to unload the incoming goods. Once the unloading is completed, it will be repaired in the dock.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Memorial Day Grandly Held</h3>
<p>Twenty days from today is U.S. Navy Memorial Day. Admiral Heald, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, is currently staying in Manila, commanding everything. The Shanghai memorial ceremony will be co-hosted by Rear Admiral Grasford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, to replace Commander Heald's absence from Shanghai. At that time, Admiral Heald will surely have a document here to show his determination to safeguard the interests of the Far East and to crush any attempt at any time. The U.S. fleet in China is now stationed in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Yantai, Shantou, North China Tianjin, and the farthest is Chongqing, with a strong lineup. The U.S. Navy Department will hold a grand memorial ceremony on this day.</p>
<h3>Subscriptions for Warehouse Rice Reach 40,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Dealers Association began to handle the registration of warehouse rice sales by the industry on the 3rd of this month. In recent days, those who have come to subscribe have been very enthusiastic. According to the association's report yesterday, as of yesterday, the number of people who have been certified is (1) 260 in the British Concession, (2) 200 in the American Concession, (3) 250 in the French Concession, and (4) about 150 in the Western District, accounting for more than two-thirds of the association's members. The amount of warehouse rice that has been certified is more than 40,000 bags, so large quantities of warehouse rice can be sold universally at a fair price in the two concessions. Although the association has closed the registration of warehouse rice at 5:00 PM yesterday, it will make an exception for those who failed to register within the specified period today. Those who have been certified and completed the registration procedures can pay at Fuyuan Qianzhuang, 70 Ningbo Road, and collect the delivery order within the date specified by the association (starting today in the Public Concession). The next day, they can present the order to the Rosford pier warehouse on the Bund for delivery.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Various Commercial Banks: Chongqing Fixed-Term Deposits; Interest Rates at a Premium Based on Shanghai-Chongqing Exchange Rates; Monthly Interest Around Two Percent</h3>
<p>To guide the movement of Shanghai capital inland, various commercial banks have initiated Chongqing fixed-term deposits. Banks in the Sichuan (川) financial group have already begun offering these deposits. Funds deposited from Shanghai will be converted at the Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate with a premium. The minimum deposit per account is 1,000 National Currency (國幣) units, with no temporary upper limit.</p>
<p>Fixed for Half a Month</p>
<p>The deposit and withdrawal dates are fixed as the middle and end of each month. Deposits made before these dates are also accepted, with interest calculated from the end of the month. Interest rates will be based on Chongqing rates and reviewed every half-month, offering a higher rate than Shanghai, approximately two percent monthly. Calculations will be based on Chongqing's standard National Currency. For example, a deposit from Shanghai of</p>
<p>Over 700 Yuan</p>
<p>Plus the exchange premium, would be converted to approximately 1,000 Yuan in Chongqing. Upon maturity, the principal and interest, in part or in full, will be paid in Chongqing's standard National Currency. If funds are to be withdrawn in cities outside Chongqing (within the Sichuan region), the bank will issue drafts. Withdrawals in Shanghai will be converted at the prevailing Chongqing-Shanghai exchange rate, aimed at limiting the flow of capital back to Shanghai. Initial trials have been quite effective.</p>
<h3>Origins and Development of Esoteric Buddhism: Melting Five Teaching Society Lecture</h3>
<h3>Melting Five Teaching Society Lecture</h3>
<p>The 22nd lecture of the Melting Five Teaching Society was introduced by Mr. Shen Jueling, featuring Mr. Wang Xianglu from Tianjin speaking on Buddhism. Mr. Wang began by stating that harmonizing the five religions is difficult, but melting them together is easier. He meticulously analyzed the meaning of melting versus harmonizing. He then praised Confucius, stating that while Confucius and Buddha differed in their approach to the world (one engaged, the other withdrawn), their teachings were most easily integrated. The key lies in understanding one's true nature and seeking it within oneself, referencing the Doctrine of the Mean, which says that "what Heaven imparts to man is called nature," and "before joy, anger, sorrow, or pleasure are aroused, it is called the Mean." He added that Zigon said that the Master's literary talent could be heard, but the Master's teachings on nature and the Way of Heaven could not. He pointed out that nature and the Way of Heaven are actually within his writings. His words were like peeling a cocoon or a banana, captivating the audience.</p>
<p>Harmony Comes From Non-Contention</p>
<p>In conclusion, he stated that the Pure Land, Chan, and Esoteric schools all ultimately return to the Samadhi of Non-Contention, and harmony comes from non-contention. Regardless of the path, one must commit to a single school and diligently practice, avoiding changing paths constantly. In time, one will naturally enter the Way. The audience was full, and everyone was captivated, with thunderous applause. After Mr. Wang stepped down, Mr. Yang Zhongyi continued with a lecture on "A Study of the Origins and Development of Esoteric Buddhism," saying he had been studying Buddhism for over thirty years, carefully extracting the essence of the Tripitaka and comparing it with native Chinese teachings, finding many confirmations. He had previously presented a complete table of the division and integration of the Three Extremes, aiming to integrate all the world's major religions.</p>
<p>Buddhism Transcends All Religions</p>
<p>He then realized that while Buddhism evolved from Brahmanism, it surpasses all other religions in the world. It then evolved into Judaism, and further into Islam. The God of Heaven is actually the Great自在天 (Mahadeva) of Buddhism. Laozi and Zhuangzi’s Taoism is philosophy, not religion. Ever since Mao Meng's prophecies, and the renaming of the twelfth month, Qin's pursuit of immortality, Han Wu's Feng and Shan sacrifices, Ge Hong's "Baopuzi," and Boyang's "Cantongqi," Marquis Liu's fasting (during the early Han dynasty) and Daoling's performance of talismans (during the late Han dynasty), Kou Qianzhi's rise in the north (during the Northern Wei dynasty), and Tao Hongjing's further prominence in the south (during the Liang dynasty), alchemy and talismans have been attributed to Taoism, and the Mysterious Female and Valley Spirit have evolved into mystery.</p>
<p>The Origins of Esoteric Buddhist Thought</p>
<p>Their Five Forms and Nine Incantations then inspired later Esoteric Buddhism. Mr. Tsumaki Naora of Japan said, "The ghosts and spirits mentioned in Baopuzi, along with the Six Jia secret incantations, the Nine Syllable True Words, and the Ling talismans of the True Form Chart of the Five Peaks, were all imitated by later Esoteric Buddhism. This proves its close connection with the thought of Baopuzi," as discussed in the "Toyo Gakuho" (東洋學報, Journal of Oriental Studies), Volume 1. Thus, Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu revealed emptiness and existence in India; Kumarajiva and Bodhiruci transmitted the image of the Dharma in China. Nagarjuna was also formerly translated as Kumarajiva, and Bodhiruci translated Nagarjuna's "Sunyatasaptati" (中論, Madhyamaka-karika) as "Long Sheng." The Tang dynasty's new translation of Nagarjuna is Long Meng, as seen in the "Records of the Western Regions." The past Buddha Wonderful Cloud Appearance is also called the Tathagata Wonderful Cloud自在王 (Isvararaja). He appeared in the first stage of joy, as seen in the "Records of Responses to the Three Treasures," quoting the "Vajra Samadhi Sutra," the "Mahavyuhasamadhi Sutra," the "Chronicles of the Transmission of the Dharma," and the "Essentials of the Eight Schools."</p>
<p>Founders of the Exoteric and Esoteric Eight Schools</p>
<p>Born into a Brahmin family, he was well-versed in scriptures. He was the disciple of Asvaghosa's disciple. Seven hundred years after Buddha's Nirvana, he was the fourteenth patriarch in the lineage. He entered the dragon palace and brought back the Avatamsaka Sutra, opened the iron tower and transmitted the secret treasury, and is known as the founder of the Exoteric and Esoteric Eight Schools. The scriptures spoken by Sakyamuni's Nirmāṇakāya (应身佛, transformation body) Buddha are the Exoteric teachings. The secret Dharma directly taught by Vairochana's Dharmakāya (法身佛, dharma body) Buddha is Esoteric Buddhism. He truly transmitted the gods and teachings of the Brahmins. Outside the Tripitaka of Sutras, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma, there is the Ritual Treasury. Its Protective Mouth True Words (衛口真言, Dharani), Body Seals (身印契, Mudras), and Mind Contemplations (心觀念, Mandala) correspond to the Three Mysteries (身口意, Body, Speech, and Mind). The Mandala diagrams transmitted by Esoteric Buddhism have different Vajra and Womb World aspects. These were not separate in India, but began with Subhakarasimha and Vajrabodhi in China. Subhakarasimha received the transmission from Dharmagupta of Nalanda Temple and came north. Vajrabodhi received the transmission from Nagarjuna's disciple Nagabodhi in Sri Lanka and came south, meeting in Qin. They each taught their learnings to Amoghavajra.</p>
<p>Subhakarasimha and Dharmagupta</p>
<p>Some say Dharmagupta is Nagabodhi, others say Subhakarasimha transmitted to his fellow disciple Vajrabodhi, and others say Amoghavajra returned to India to receive both lineages from Nagabodhi, transmitting them to Hui Guo. Others say Subhakarasimha transmitted to Hui Guo. In the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Subhakarasimha came and transmitted the Womb World Mandala. In the eighth year, Vajrabodhi came and transmitted the Vajra Mandala. Amoghavajra came with him, only sixteen years old. He returned after twenty-nine years, and came again in the fifth year of the Tianbao era, translating over a hundred scriptures and treatises in one hundred and forty-three volumes. He received generous treatment from Emperor Daizong. Yi Xing first followed Subhakarasimha, then received initiation from Vajrabodhi. In Japan, Esoteric Buddhism has two branches: Amoghavajra and Hui Guo transmitted to Kukai, known as Kobo Daishi, which is the To-Mitsu. The Tendai sect of Mount Hiei is from the Subhakarasimha lineage. The Mandala is the result of the Womb World and the cause of the Vajra World, which is opposite of the To-Mitsu. Outside the two branches, Ennin transmitted the Susiddhikara ritual, making it the Three Divisions. After the Tang Dynasty, Esoteric Buddhism flourished in Japan, while China only preserved the Yoga Flaming Mouth ritual. In the early Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, the transmission of Esoteric Buddhism was forbidden. Tibetan Lamaism, transmitted by Padmasambhava from India. In the late Qing Dynasty, Yang Wenhui's disciples Gui Nianzu, Shamen Xianyin, and Dayong Chishong successively studied in Japan. Wang Hongyuan of Guangdong and Chaozhou and Cheng Zhaitan of Sichuan went to Japan for initiation. Recently, Rong Zeng Kanbu, a disciple of the Panchen Lama, came to Shanghai, and many received Dharma from him. In the future, someone will certainly integrate the Esoteric Buddhism of East and Tibet.</p>
<h3>There are Still Large Tides Today</h3>
<p>The tide in the Huangpu River has been quite high for the past few days. The measurements are all above twelve feet, and today's tide is expected to be the highest, approaching thirteen feet. The Bund's embankment will be topped by the tide, and water reaching the low-lying Rue du Consulat (雀馬路) is unavoidable. This high tide is expected to subside after the tenth. From then on, autumn floods can be anticipated.</p>
<h3>US Lake-Class Gunboat Sails up the Yangtze</h3>
<p>The US Navy's shallow-water gunboat USS Luzon (呂宋號), stationed in Shanghai, left Shanghai for a cruise on the Yangtze River one day, returning three days later. Details were reported in a previous newspaper. Now, we know that the US gunboat USS Oahu (奧湖號) raised anchor at noon yesterday and departed from the Wusong port at 2 PM, heading up the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Coal at Fixed Prices for Two Industries to be Sold Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association commissioned the Kailuan Mining Bureau to supply 600 tons of "Shushui Coal" (熟水煤, prepared water coal). Sales to the bathhouse industry began yesterday at 10 AM, with each household limited to one ton, priced at 100 Yuan (兀) per ton in National Currency (國幣). From today until the ninth, the "Shushui Shops" (熟水店, hot water shops) can also purchase coal at fixed prices, with the same quantity and price as the bathhouse industry. Owners of hot water shops can apply for membership certificates from the association starting today. They can then take their certificates and original seals to the coal distribution office of the Coal Industry Association at 405 Tianjin Road to obtain "Coal Purchase Certificates." They can then pay at the Yuan Tai Hua Zhong Yi Tai Coal Company to purchase the coal.</p>

<h3>Robbers Flee With Stolen Goods: Killed Japanese Soldier with Gunfire; Soldier Tries to Intercept Approaching Robbers: Shot in a Vital Spot, Also Injuring a Passerby</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road in Hongkou, an incident occurred last night around 8:40 PM in which robbers shot and killed a Japanese soldier on guard duty. A stray bullet also injured a passerby. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Fleeing With Stolen Goods</p>
<p>A robbery occurred at a certain address on East-West Huade Road in Hongkou around 8:40 PM last night. The victim secretly reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives. The robbers, realizing they had been discovered, scattered in all directions with the stolen goods. Two of them ran towards the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, with detectives in hot pursuit, blowing whistles.</p>
<p>Soldier Killed</p>
<p>A Japanese naval landing force private first class, named Ikeda Masaharu (池田正治, age 30), stationed at the wire mesh entrance there, noticed two men in short clothes running frantically. Realizing they were not good people, he rushed forward, intending to block their path. However, finding no way to escape, the robbers pulled out their guns and fired several shots at the Japanese soldier. Ikeda Masaharu was unable to dodge and was shot in vital areas, including his left face, chest, and ribs. He immediately fell to the ground and died. The robbers ultimately escaped.</p>
<p>Passerby Injured</p>
<p>At the same time, a passerby named Ji Xibing (季錫炳, age 25) was hit in the left chest by a stray bullet and collapsed. Street police summoned an ambulance, which transported him to the Shanghai Sanitarium Hospital on Target Road for treatment. Afterwards, the Japanese military authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately blocked all bridges connecting Suzhou Creek. They, together with police officers from both the Hongkou and Public Concession police stations, cordoned off the area and conducted a rigorous search for the robbers. The operation continued until midnight without success. The body of the Japanese soldier was taken away by the Japanese in a hearse. The bridges over Suzhou Creek that had been closed were reopened at approximately 10:35 PM.</p>
<h3>Candy Shop Pelted with Excrement</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at 9 PM, while the Lao Shen Cheng Chang (老申成昌) candy and pastry shop at No. 16 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession (across from the Great World entertainment center) was crowded with customers enthusiastically buying mooncakes, a ruffian suddenly appeared, holding a paper package. He threw it into the shop. The package turned out to be full of excrement. The package broke upon impact, splattering the foul liquid everywhere. The shop assistants and the merchandise were covered in excrement, and a terrible stench filled the air. Customers scrambled to escape. The ruffian turned and fled. The shop assistants chased after him and caught the perpetrator. He confessed his name was Liu A Yi (劉阿一), from Shaoxing, and claimed he was hired for ten yuan to do this. He was vague on further details. He was taken into custody at the police station pending investigation. It is rumored that this incident is related to a labor dispute with the guild. The police are investigating the instigator based on Liu's testimony and are working to arrest and prosecute him in conjunction with Liu.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Kang Nian Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<p>At approximately 10:10 PM last night, a fire broke out at the Kang Nian Pharmaceutical Factory workshop at No. 53 Rue Amiral Bayle in the Public Concession due to careless handling of alcohol. Two workers were burned. Zhang Menghai (張孟海), age 17, from Suzhou, was burned on his left hand, foot, and head. Zhang Hao (張豪) suffered severe burns on both hands and feet, with the skin peeling off, a ghastly sight. An ambulance was summoned to the scene and transported the injured workers to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, there were many people at the factory who quickly extinguished the fire, preventing a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Thugs Demand Festival Fees: Mob Injures Vegetable Vendor</h3>
<p>Li A Si (李阿四), residing at No. 11 Rongchang Lane, Avenue Edward VII, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, has been running a vegetable stall at the Old Zhabei Market. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month (Mid-Autumn Festival) around 4 PM, a thug named Lu A Hai (魯阿海), nicknamed "Little Devil Ah Hai," demanded Mid-Autumn Festival fees from Li, leading to a conflict. This angered Lu, who gathered over twenty thugs, including "Long Legs Ah Gen" and "Shi Lao Ba," carrying iron bars and other weapons. They stormed Li's home and beat him severely before scattering. Li reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station and showed them his injuries. The police dispatched officers to arrest the perpetrators, but Lu A Hai had already fled. A strict search is underway.</p>
<h3>Foreign Reporter's Account of Touring Nanshi</h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that Nanshi today is a scene of poverty, but gambling is rampant, which is quite strange. In the past half year, six large gambling dens have opened in Nanshi, attracting thousands upon thousands of gamblers. Inside, one sees gamblers huddled together, intently watching the progress of the gambling, beads of sweat dripping from their foreheads, a pitiable sight. Outside the gambling dens, on the stone roads overgrown with weeds, are impoverished people, mostly peasants and coolies.</p>
<p>Gambling is Most Flourishing</p>
<p>Currently, the most flourishing business in Nanshi is gambling, followed by used clothing and shoe stores, which are also very prevalent. These used goods stores are located at the entrances of gambling dens. Gamblers often lose all their cash and then go to the used goods stores to sell their clothes, shoes, and hats. The reporter saw a well-dressed Chinese man emerge from a gambling den and enter a used goods store, quickly sell his shoes for six yuan, and then return barefoot to the gambling den for one last desperate gamble. Gamblers enter and leave the gambling dens day and night without ceasing.</p>
<p>Gamblers Huddled Together</p>
<p>The reporter also strolled inside and was immediately approached by two women who pulled at his sleeve, inviting him to the gambling table. Six women were playing "blackjack" next to the table and persistently invited the reporter to join. The reporter dislikes this sort of thing and only offered to bet five jiao. They covered their mouths and laughed, as the minimum bet was one yuan and usually five yuan. There were over thirty large gambling tables in the gambling den, surrounded by gamblers. The reporter saw a portly Chinese man pull out a stack of ten-yuan bills, and soon only half of them remained.</p>
<p>Young Women Hawking</p>
<p>Gamblers can drink and smoke for free. For those who bring children, fruit and milk are provided upstairs, and Western and Chinese meals are provided for free. There are even young women serving those who use drugs, to attract more gamblers. When a gambler has lost badly and is penniless, the gambling den provides five or six cars to take him home. The most popular gambling game is "Tai Sai" (大小, Big Small), and the bets are enormous. The reporter saw a "Tai Sai" table where tens of thousands of yuan changed hands in a quarter of an hour. Cantonese people love Fan-Tan, and there is a special section where only Japanese people are allowed to gamble.</p>
<p>Rubble and Ruins</p>
<p>About a year ago, Nanshi was very desolate, only inhabited by beggars and the extremely poor. Now, however, even damaged houses without doors, windows, or roofs have residents. Rubble and ruins are still everywhere. Houses destroyed by gunfire have rarely been rebuilt. The piles of rubble serve as public toilets, with an unbearable stench. When the Japanese opened Nanshi a year ago, Chinese people were attracted by the low rents and poured in. According to the reporter, Nanshi rents are only one-eighth of what they are in the concessions, and there are no "small rent" (小租) scams.</p>
<p>Inside the City God Temple</p>
<p>Transportation in Nanshi relies entirely on rickshaws. Occasionally, a car passes by, all driven by Japanese people or from gambling dens. Although there are quite a few shops in Nanshi, they are all small stores. There are probably no more than ten wealthy Chinese residents in Nanshi. Their homes are surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by armed men. In the past, the City God Temple was filled with incense smoke, and devout men and women prostrated in worship. The market was crowded with customers and extremely prosperous. Now, the temple market is gone. Only a few poor people buy and sell rice and noodles where rare treasures were once sold. Several beggars are in front of the Buddha statues, either lying on the ground or catching lice, silent and still.</p>
<p>Few Japanese</p>
<p>There are no Japanese soldiers on the streets of Nanshi, as they have been almost entirely withdrawn. The few remaining Japanese soldiers are stationed inside barracks heavily fortified with barbed wire and sandbags. In major cities like Beiping and Nanjing, Japanese shops line the streets, but the reporter only saw one or two Japanese shops while touring Nanshi for four hours. He encountered no more than ten Japanese people. Since the residents are mostly from the impoverished class, they are unlikely to be targeted by bandits.</p>
<p>Theft and Extortion</p>
<p>However, petty theft is rampant. It is said that at least five thousand people are currently arrested and awaiting trial for fraud and theft. According to Nanshi residents, they do not pay "small rent" (小租), but they are often subjected to extortion, resulting in significant losses. Every Chinese resident of Nanshi must pay one yuan and four jiao to obtain a residential registration certificate. Without this certificate, they will be arrested. The Japanese have confiscated the houses abandoned by Chinese people who fled Nanshi during the Battle of Shanghai and are now renting them out at low prices. A three-room house rents for thirty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Heroin is Rampant</p>
<p>There are many opium dens in Nanshi. Only registered opium smokers are allowed inside. Heroin use does not require registration. Heroin is ten times more harmful than opium, and heroin is rampant in Nanshi. Countless people are using it, and many are dying from its toxicity. Two cinemas have recently opened in Nanshi, but they are rarely full, as gambling addicts prefer to frequent the gambling dens, and 95% of the residents cannot even afford food and clothing, let alone regularly go to the cinema. Access to the area along the Huangpu River is prohibited. From what the reporter saw, the area along the river is quite deserted, with only a few small boats idly moored by the riverbank.</p>
<p>Fleas are Abundant</p>
<p>Most of the factories along the river are closed. There are not many beggars in Nanshi, perhaps because the residents are too poor to give alms. Although there are few beggars, there are many fleas. The reporter has traveled all over the world, and he has not seen as many fleas as in Nanshi, except in Turkey and Romania. During his tour of Nanshi, he took a rickshaw twice and visited a friend's home for a short chat, and was bitten by fleas.</p>
<h3>French Police Department: Criminal Report</h3>
<p>Criminal cases in the French Concession in September were roughly the same as in the previous two months, including two assassination cases. The first occurred on September 1st in Lane 401, Avenue Foch. The perpetrator was an unknown person, and the victim was a shareholder of the Chang An gambling den. The second victim was a Russian merchant named Mamontoff, who was shot in the abdomen at 6 AM on September 14th while traveling by rickshaw in front of Lane 1252, Route Lafayette. He died the following day in the Hopital Sainte Marie due to his injuries. After the incident, the French police immediately began investigating. On the second day, the police arrested the gunman and a suspect who was alleged to have incited the murder. A third accomplice was apprehended on the third day. The gunman was a Chinese bodyguard who had been paid seventy yuan in advance. The accomplice who recruited the gunman had received three hundred yuan. Although the victim, Mamontoff, was severely wounded, he was able to tell the police the name of the instigator, identified as Bik, also known as Avans. The motive was personal revenge. All three suspects are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>There was only one kidnapping case involving weapons. The victim was the manager of the Great China Rubber Factory, who was kidnapped by seven bandits at 7 AM on the 7th of the month at his residence on Avenue Haig.</p>
<p>In September, there were nine robberies and armed robberies. After investigation, twenty-eight robbers were apprehended, and three handguns were recovered, one of which was a forgery. In addition, there were two incidents of police officers being robbed. The first occurred on the night of September 1st at the intersection of Route Belles and Rue Montauban when two robbers approached an Annamite policeman on duty and stole his handgun. When the policeman gave chase, one of the robbers fired a shot, killing a passerby who tried to stop them. The second incident occurred on Route Belles No. 25 Lane. A Sikh policeman was robbed by armed robbers. One of the three robbers was shot and killed by a Chinese policeman from the Public Concession. A Mauser pistol was found on his body.</p>
<p>In September, incidents of property damage and burglary decreased slightly compared to August. There were twenty-two cases of property damage and theft, compared to twenty-nine in August. There were twenty cases of burglary, compared to twenty-four in August. Sixteen of these cases have been solved, and fifteen burglars have been apprehended. During the same period, the police received 131 reports of ordinary theft, of which fifty-nine have been solved, and seventy-four suspects have been apprehended.</p>
<p>Among these reports, nine involved the theft of automobiles. All of these automobiles have been recovered, but some of them have had parts such as batteries stolen.</p>
<p>Also, the police conducted 132 searches of hotels and inns in the Concession in September.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warehouse Burned Down: Heavy Losses; One Foreign Firefighter Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that a major fire broke out on Haining Road yesterday (the 5th) at 4 PM, destroying two Japanese-owned warehouses and spreading to a neighboring lumberyard and cardboard box factory. A foreign firefighter from the Public Concession Fire Brigade, Stan辛耐維樞, sustained minor injuries while fighting the fire and was immediately taken to a hospital. His injuries are reportedly not serious. The losses from the fire have not yet been estimated. However, the owner of the burned building stated that all of his property was almost entirely destroyed. The Japanese warehouse contained a large quantity of paper, which is reportedly where the fire started. It quickly spread to the neighboring lumberyard. Five fire engines arrived at the scene and extinguished the fire after four hours.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," at around 3:40 PM on the 5th, a fire broke out in the Yamada warehouse, No. 91 Jiugeng Lane, No. 97 Haimi Road (负责人岩永松之助, Manager Iwanaga Matsunosuke), which belongs to the Stacking Trade Association. The fire quickly spread, and the warehouse and six residential houses were burned down. The fire was extinguished at 5 PM. The cause of the fire is unknown, and the losses are estimated to be very large, totaling 500,000 yuan (兀).</p>
<h3>Five-Year-Old Child Scalded to Death</h3>
<p>Weng Baofu's (翁寳富) only son, Xiao Mao (小毛), age five, residing at No. 1158 Xujiahui Road, was playing outside on the afternoon of the 1st of this month around 4 PM. He bumped into a copper pot of boiling water being carried by a nine-year-old girl. The scalding water burned his right face, abdomen, and legs. He was sent to the Hopital Sainte Marie. Due to the heat toxicity affecting his heart, treatment was ineffective, and he died on the afternoon of the 4th at 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Owner of Rui Feng Rayon Company, Yu Ruilin, Shot to Death: Shot while Riding in a Chartered Car out of the Lane: Struck in the Chest and Abdomen, Died Instantly</h3>
<p>At 10:50 AM yesterday morning, an assassination took place at the entrance of Cuixiang Lane on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession. The victim was Yu Ruilin (俞瑞林), the owner of Rui Feng Rayon Company, who was shot twice and died instantly due to injuries to his chest and abdomen. The details of the case are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Established Silk Company</p>
<p>Yu Ruilin, age 28, from Shaoxing, previously established Rui Feng Rayon Company at No. 16 Yu Yu Lane on Nanjing Road. He moved to No. 9 Cuixiang Lane, No. 446 Ningbo Road, in May of this year due to business expansion. At the same time, Yu lived in the shop with his concubine, Ms. Jin (金氏, age 25, from Shaoxing), and their son (born twelve months ago). Due to the flourishing business, Yu also opened Jifan Silk Factory in Hongkou, serving as its manager.</p>
<p>Shot While in Car</p>
<p>At 10:50 AM yesterday morning, Yu, wearing a gray parisienne long gown and yellow leather shoes, was being pulled out of the lane in his own chartered car No. 11304 by a rickshaw puller named Chen Hairu (陳海如) from Tongzhou. He was heading to meet a client for business. As they were turning east at the lane entrance, two assassins suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, one wearing a cotton shirt and pants, and the other wearing a black gown. The assassin in the short shirt and pants fired a shot. The bullet struck the tire, causing it to explode with a loud bang.</p>
<p>Two Shots Prove Fatal</p>
<p>Yu, hearing the gunshot, quickly jumped out of the car, attempting to take cover. The assassin chased after him and fired two more shots, one hitting Yu in the abdomen and the other in the chest. He immediately collapsed in a pool of blood, gasping for breath. The rickshaw puller, Chen Hairu, was being watched by the other assassin and did not dare to shout for help. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the two assassins mingled into the crowd and escaped without a trace. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the news and quickly summoned a car to take the injured Yu to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he soon died. The police are currently investigating the circumstances of the case. It is also known that Yu has a wife, Ms. Xu (徐氏), who has a son and currently lives in their hometown.</p>

<h3>The Extent of Increase in Chinese and Western Stocks</h3>
<p>— Bing Zhong</p>
<p>In the past, except for a few stocks whose market prices were occasionally heard, Chinese stocks were mostly unknown. Even large securities firms mainly dealt in government bonds as their main business, while stock trading was only a side business, which they could do or not do. If customers came to the door, they might or might not attend to them. However, everything is impermanent, and what is usually looked down upon may suddenly be elevated, and dead trees may bloom. Just as a dull scholar may have a chance to rise, the rise of Chinese stocks is similar to this.</p>
<p>Because rich people look down on money, they almost want to convert all their money as quickly as possible. Not to mention stocks, even bamboo heads, wood scraps, broken copper, scrap iron, and broken threads are favored by hoarders. Therefore, under this psychology, everything is valuable except for banknotes. In fact, banknotes are not worthless; if they were worthless, where would the money come from? In order to buy foreign stocks, sometimes people suffer great losses. When they buy in, the price immediately falls, and when they sell out, it soars. They are slapped on both sides of the face, and the money flows into the pockets of foreigners. Why should the money that Chinese people have worked so hard to earn be squandered by others? Wealth should not flow out, so it is better to buy and sell Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>The flourishing business of buying and selling Chinese stocks has only been in recent years. The first company to focus on buying and selling Chinese stocks as its business and appeal to society was China Stock Company. Later, more people echoed, the trading flourished, and there were more people doing Chinese stock business. Since the expansion of the European war into the German-Soviet war, and the US attitude has become increasingly clear, there is a possibility of a storm in the Pacific at any time. People generally have more considerations about the future of foreign stocks. Many stable friends and patriotic wealthy people thought that it would be better to buy and sell Chinese stocks. It is the same as making money, so why cultivate other people's fields instead of one's own? Therefore, Chinese stocks have recently become more popular than foreign stocks.</p>
<p>To what extent have Chinese and foreign stocks risen now? Usually, we only see them rise in the newspapers, but we don't know how much they have risen. Therefore, we will compare the transaction price of each stock with its face value, and then list its market price above or below the face value. We originally wanted to use the market prices of October 1, but we later chose the most recent day, which was Friday, October 3. If there was no market price on that day, we might refer to October 1 or 2. All the prices used are transaction prices. If there is no transaction price, we may use the buying price.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks are very conservative - or rather, inert. China has long abolished taels and adopted yuan, but their share capital is still calculated in taels (and some in pounds), but their market prices are now quoted in legal tender. Therefore, for the convenience of readers to compare, we will uniformly convert the legal tender used to express market prices into the same currency as the face value for comparison. There is no problem with taels at 0.715. Although 70 yuan per pound is lower than the current exchange rate, it is good that the conversion rate has different sizes, and the ratio is ultimately similar.</p>
<p>As for the trends of various stocks, they are already shown in the table and will not be described further. Readers will understand after a brief look.</p>

<h3>Economic Chats</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Hoarding (II)</p>
<p>Some say that Zigong, a disciple of Confucius, was good at commerce, so it is said, "If there is a beautiful jade here, should I keep it in a box and hide it, or should I seek a good merchant and sell it?" Is this not hoarding for profit? I say: No, let alone Zigong's analogy to ask Confucius why he had the Way but did not serve, even from the literal point of view, keeping a beautiful jade in a box and hiding it, and seeking a good price to sell it, is at most a kind of speculation. However, speculation also has its limits. If you have obtained a good price but still refuse to sell, then it is called speculation. If you wait for a merchant to sell, it is not wanting to sell jade on the street, which is different from the meaning of hoarding. Hoarding is gathering a large amount of goods, waiting for a merchant to obtain an extraordinary profit, while keeping jade in a box is nothing more than regarding it as a rare treasure, carefully treasured.</p>
<p>Then, can Mencius's "seeking a dragon ridge to ascend, to look left and right, and to plan for market profits" be called hoarding? I say: Yes, but the degree is still different. A dragon ridge (long ridge) is a high ridge in the field. Mencius used it as a metaphor for a merchant waiting to sell goods, like climbing high to look left and right, to see where the price is high, and then sell there to make a profit. It is not that the dragon ridge is hoarding. However, the dragon ridge is quite similar to today's exchange market, because buying and selling in the exchange market has the ability to influence market prices. People think it is high, it is high; it is low, it is low. The auctioneer sits high and looks down, looking left and right, very much like climbing a dragon ridge and looking left and right. However, this is not the dragon ridge that Mencius meant at that time. The English word for monopoly is Corner, which originally meant a corner. Refusing to sell in a corner is as good as ascending a ridge and looking around. How similar is the intention of Chinese and Western words?</p>
<p>If so, then Fan Li's "managing property and accumulating goods with the times" can be considered today's hoarding. I say: Although it is similar, in fact it is not as severe as today's hoarding, it is only the usual inventory in commerce. After King Goujian of Yue ascended the throne, Fan Li knew that he could not live in peace with him, so he thought of Ji Ran's plan, used five out of ten, and ascended the throne of Yue. Now that he had applied it to the country, he wanted to apply it to his family. So Li took a small boat, floated on the rivers and lakes, changed his name, and went to Tao in the state of Qi. He called himself Zhu Gong (also called Tao Zhugong, using the place name and pseudonym together. Zhu Gong had a great reputation and lived in Tao, so he was called Tao Zhugong.) Because Tao was located in the center of the world, the lords communicated with each other, and goods were traded there, so he managed property and accumulated goods with the times, and did not demand from others. The so-called "property" means production, so "managing property" and "making a living" are often mentioned together. However, the meaning of "property" is broad, and all property is called property. Because property can be produced, it is called property; property can establish a business, so it is also called industry. Goods are a large part of property, and property includes goods. Managing means managing (the Tang people avoided the name of Emperor Gaozong, so all "managing" was changed to "managing"), managing property means managing goods. Accumulating means storing, accumulating with the times means hoarding goods to profit with the times. However, in running a business, it is necessary to store goods in advance to meet general demand, so accumulating is not hoarding. However, if you accumulate goods but do not sell them at high prices, and the amount you accumulate far exceeds the amount you should have prepared for sales, then it can be called hoarding. As for profiting with the times, it is the proper meaning of commerce.</p>
<p>However, the so-called "expensive granary" in the late Western Han Dynasty is almost equivalent to the meaning of hoarding. A granary is a storehouse. An expensive granary means that the stored goods must wait until the price is high before they are sold. Is this not hoarding for profit? Hoarding is thinking that there are rare goods to hoard; refusing to sell what you have bought, you will not sell until you achieve your desired purpose. When goods become rare, their self-regard is high. Then, where did the word hoarding come from? I think it comes from accumulating grass and storing grain. Accumulating grass and storing grain was originally used to supply the army, not for doing business. Because horses cannot do without grass and the army cannot do without grain, it is called hoarding to gather a large amount of grain and grass for use. It is then applied to commerce, which is what we call hoarding goods for profit today.</p>
<p>Shanghai merchants call hoarding goods "collapsing goods." When asked what collapsing means, they say "collapsing in." Collapsing in is not enough to exhaust the meaning of hoarding. Hoarding must mean gathering a large amount of goods, which collapsing in cannot encompass, so its meaning must be elsewhere. However, I do not know that the meaning of "collapsing" has been around for a long time. In the early Ming Dynasty, the residences of soldiers and civilians in the capital (the capital at that time was Nanjing) were all provided by the government, and there was no space between the houses. Therefore, when merchants' goods arrived, they either stopped on boats or were stored outside the city. The middlemen got the price together, and the merchants suffered. The Taizu then ordered the construction of houses near the water outside the Three Mountains and other gates, called collapsing houses, to store merchants' goods. During the Yongle period, he ordered the establishment of inns and collapsing houses in various places. Collapsing houses are today's warehouses; all hoarded goods must be stored in warehouses, so they are called collapsing goods, referring to the goods in the warehouse. Not all goods in the warehouse are hoarded goods, but the goods stored in the warehouse are often large quantities, and the hoarded goods must be stored in the warehouse in large quantities. This is the origin of calling hoarded goods collapsing goods. Today's merchants only know that it is so, but they do not know why, so I reveal it here. (The End)</p>
<p>Economic Industry Talk, originally meant to fill in the gaps and adjust the readers' eyesight, so it occasionally publishes one or two articles to help the conversation. Fortunately, since its publication, although it has been intermittent, it has still attracted the attention of some readers. Due to the limited space of this magazine, except for "Hoarding," which was arranged into rice last month, and what has been published should still be continued, it will no longer be published in this magazine in the future. Moreover, what has been published is only a glimpse of the whole, which is not enough to sully the eyes of the readers, and I am also afraid that it is not enough to satisfy the readers' expectations; I hope that there will be an opportunity to publish and print it all in the future, and then ask the readers for a complete criticism, which is interesting.</p>
<h3>Dried Shrimp Prices Drop</h3>
<p>Due to the high market price of dried shrimp, the price has recently dropped significantly. Yesterday, the selling price of Jinjun tail was 900 yuan, Tianbian tail was 850 yuan, Chaobian tail was 1,150 yuan, Longxudao tail was 880 yuan, and Jiangbei Kaiyang was 450 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Need to Worry About Sugar: What's the Use of Hoarding Sugar?</h3>
<p>Successive shipments of sugar arriving in Shanghai have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Taikoo Company's Bei Hai vessel arrived in port on Saturday (4th), carrying 1,600 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. In addition, the Jinan vessel arrived in Shanghai this Sunday (5th), also carrying 1,350 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 300 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. It is said that a large batch of Dutch sugar has arrived in Hong Kong. Due to yesterday's Autumn Festival holiday, accurate numbers will only be reported today. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Autumn Festival Hardware Sales Lackluster</h3>
<p>Since the Mid-Autumn Festival, the metal market has been quiet after silver and money businesses, foreign firms and various large and small factories closed for the holiday. Metal transactions are few and far between. The large-scale intake of factories in this street is restricted by customs closure, and sales are lacking. Moreover, foreign customers' purchases before the festival have already stopped, and it is difficult to have further intentions during this holiday period. Therefore, due to the solitary sales, the standards of various metal goods have not shown significant rises or falls. Yesterday, the market price of two-pound black iron billets was 5,200-5,300 yuan per bundle, 8-16 gauge white lead wire was 240-250 yuan per picul, Canadian blue lead was 690 yuan, and Cellpi lead was 620-630 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chestnut</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The chestnut is a deciduous tree belonging to the beech family, with a trunk four or five zhang high, leaves that are long and elliptical with pointed ends, resembling arrowheads, with sharp serrated edges, and white fluff on the underside. It blooms unisexual flowers in May, which are yellow-white, with male and female flowers on the same tree. The male flowers are arranged in catkins, and the female flowers usually grow in clusters of three, wrapped in an involucre, sprouting from the base of the male flower spikes. The fruit is a nut, contained within a cupule that develops from the involucre. The cupule, with its spiky, urchin-like appearance, is prickly to the touch. When the fruit matures in autumn, it vigorously bursts open the cupule and leaps out, like a small bomb exploding: the "chestnut falling" mentioned in the Greater Dai Ritual, and the "chestnut scattering" mentioned in the Eastern Han Records, both refer to this phenomenon of seed dispersal, which shows the ancients' careful observation of things.</p>
<p>Where is the chestnut's homeland? This question cannot and need not be discussed, because it has long been widely distributed throughout the Eurasian continent since prehistoric times—also in the New World—and where can we trace the traces of this spread? According to the most reliable documents in our country: the two sentences in the Bin Feng Dong Shan chapter of the Book of Songs, "There are gourds on the mound, steaming in the chestnut firewood," are the works of the Duke of Zhou in the 12th century BC: the phrase "The tribute of women is no more than hazelnuts, chestnuts, dates, and dried meat" in the 24th year of the Duke Zhuang of Zuo Zhuan, is the speech of Yu Sun in 670 BC; as for the Tang Feng of the Book of Songs "There is varnish on the mountain, and chestnuts in the swamp", the Yong Feng "Planting hazelnuts and chestnuts", the Nei Ze of the Book of Rites "Children serve their parents, wives serve their parents-in-law, sweetening them with dates, chestnuts, malt sugar, and honey", and the various sentences in the Zhou Rites and the Book of Etiquette, all prove that our people have known how to eat this "gold-like, white jade-like" chestnut for many years.</p>
<p>Since the history of the chestnut is so ancient, and the chestnut's footprint is so broad, why do people now habitually like "Liangxiang Chestnuts"? Why has the name "Liangxiang" almost become synonymous with chestnuts? I have tried to read through the records of our country since ancient times, and I want to understand its origins by getting to the bottom of things! As a result, I know that this name has only existed since the Southern Song Dynasty, and before that, there is not a trace of it! Moreover, there are several cities famous for producing good chestnuts, some of which are older than Liangxiang, but all of them have been eliminated and disappeared! It can be seen that this little bit of false fame, which is irrelevant to reality and unimportant, also seems to be predestined, and cannot be forced by people or things themselves (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Last Three Months</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>I heard that not long ago, a US movie was shown in Shanghai. The story in the movie was about a person suffering from heart disease. The doctor told him that he only had three months left to live. This startled and worried the patient, who thought that he should do something beneficial to society in these short three months, so as not to waste his life. As a result, he killed someone who was harmful to society. After the case was discovered, he was sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Later, it was said that in a summer conference at a Christian university, some students brought up the interesting topic of "If I could only live for three more months" for discussion, and everyone freely expressed their opinions. As a result, there were many different opinions. Some people sympathized with the patient in the movie, some people opposed it, and others suggested their own ways of using the last three months.</p>
<p>If one could only live for three more months, then those last days would certainly be very precious. If we really knew the date of our death, then we would definitely find a way to make good use of the remaining time. This is something that everyone would do. However, most people do not know the end of their lives, and that is where the mystery of life lies. Our life is short, but at the same time, it seems to have no end. This makes prudent people live an alert life, and lazy people live a muddled life. Prudent people are constantly trying to make the most of their precious life, and in their last three months, they do not need to be anxious or change their life plan. Therefore, the most successful people still live their normal lives in their last three months.</p>

<h3>Autumn Lament</h3>
<p>— Bai Mei</p>
<p>Ladies, Be Careful of Your Future</p>
<p>When Miss Jin triumphantly caused her principal to divorce his wife, she was overjoyed, thinking she would certainly grow old with the principal. Wasn't it so? The day of their public wedding at the Youth Association was truly a happy day! Because from that day on, she would be the official principal's wife. However, the previous principal's wife, before the divorce, had spoken to her, telling her: They had also married out of love, and when they married, they had both just graduated from middle school. To advance her husband's future, she had sacrificed her own chance to attend university, using her father's inheritance to support her husband through university. She herself became an elementary school teacher, supporting herself and her elderly mother. Only after her husband graduated, worked for several years, and saved some money, was he able to start the current school. Now, her husband's inconstancy was simply because he had some stinking money. For the sake of her elderly mother and a newborn baby, the principal's wife begged her to stand in the position of a woman and not destroy another's family. But Miss Jin cleverly denied everything. "Principal's wife, you're mistaken. How could I interfere in your family affairs?"</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. One year, two years, three years. The elderly mother of the abandoned principal's wife passed away due to sorrow. The child also left his mother, following his grandmother. At this time, the pitiful woman, stimulated by the separation and death of her husband, mother, and beloved child, became completely disillusioned and devoted herself to the Buddha, with neither love nor hate for anyone.</p>
<p>During these three years, Miss Jin, the new principal's wife, naturally lived a very comfortable life. She had once conceived a child of love, but it soon died. However, now a second precious baby had been born. Just before the birth of this second baby, the principal's heart changed again for some reason. Perhaps another lady had captured his heart! The current principal's wife felt a nameless panic in her heart. Initially, due to the principal's coldness, they often argued. Later, they even resorted to violence. Recalling three years ago, Miss Jin often wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Happiness, at some point, quietly left Miss Jin. Now, she was accompanied only by constant depression. However, the principal did not change his mind at all due to her depression. Instead, he became even more intimate with another lady. Whenever the sun set, Miss Jin leaned against the railing, softly singing a sad autumn song, while the principal and another lady were busily going in and out of theaters and dance halls. "Be patient! Maybe he will have a change of heart one day," Miss Jin often consoled herself.</p>
<p>When the second child was just over a month old, the principal and his wife had another major argument over a minor matter. The principal finally announced his final decision and proposed a divorce. Miss Jin's beautiful dream was now completely shattered. Reason told her to argue it out with the principal: "Why do you want to divorce me?" "Because I don't love you anymore!" "Then why did you love me before?" "That was then, this is now!" Miss Jin was so angry that she couldn't say anything. "Just sign the divorce papers, take a few thousand dollars, and be done with it. Why bother talking so much? Wasn't the previous wife a good example?" The principal pressed further. "Let me consider it for a while," Miss Jin said. The question of divorce was temporarily put on hold, awaiting Miss Jin's consideration.</p>
<p>To agree or not to agree? Became the battle in Miss Jin's mind. "The previous wife..." How long ago was it? She herself had become the previous wife. Before the previous wife's divorce, she had asked her to stand in the position of a woman and not destroy another's family. Should she also go talk to the future principal's wife? "Who can interfere in your family affairs?" This imagined answer made her lose courage. Leaning against the railing and singing a sad autumn song had become Miss Jin's only pastime in recent months.

<h3>Black Lungs</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>The normal color of human lungs is light red, but the residents of large cities have black lungs. Dr. Darlington, after dissecting many corpses in New York, said that their lungs were as black as the night. Another doctor said that the lungs of New Yorkers were as black as coal.</p>
<p>In fact, the lungs of residents of major cities around the world are not much more beautiful than those of New Yorkers. Because this is an unfortunate consequence of modern civilization. People want to enjoy material civilization, and can only endure this misfortune for the time being. Living anywhere, city or countryside, you can keep your conscience clear; but you cannot avoid breathing air. So you can only let your lungs be blackened day by day.</p>
<p>Because when you go outdoors for so-called fresh air, you are actually breathing foul air full of germs and smoke.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Blackwell of Milwaukee, it is estimated that nearly 150 tons of dust fall in that city per square mile in a single month. A person's lungs will be as black as coal after living in this city for only five years.</p>
<p>Because the air is full of smoke and gas, the ultraviolet rays emitted from the sun are severely affected, and the health of infants is also affected, even requiring cod liver oil for nourishment.</p>
<p>The only remedy now is to go to the suburbs and countryside often, and to live in higher houses. But isn't this just a dream for Shanghai residents?</p>

<h3>Lightless Torch</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Engineers at the General Electric Company of America have recently invented a "lightless" electric torch that allows cities enforcing blackout regulations not to be completely dark, while enemy aircraft still cannot detect its light. This light is a three-watt argon lamp, emitting only one candle of light, while ordinary street lights are four thousand candles. This invisible light contains ultraviolet rays, which only become bright when shone on fluorescent paint. If the road curbs are painted with fluorescent paint and illuminated with argon lamps, pedestrians and drivers can see clearly, but aircraft cannot.</p>

<h3>Solar Eclipse in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Ze Nan</p>
<p>The solar eclipse on the twenty-first day of the ninth month was a rare phenomenon of the century, so it was not only an opportunity for scientific observation, but also a rare visual feast for the general public. The situation of the solar eclipse observed in Shanghai has been detailed in various newspapers. Now, we have received a letter from a friend in the accompanying capital, describing the results of the observation in Chongqing on that day, which is excerpted to share with readers.</p>
<p>"The observation of the solar eclipse on September 21st was preceded by light rain the night before, but by the morning of the 21st, the clouds suddenly cleared, and the sunlight was very bright between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm. Although there were occasional cloud cover, it did not hinder the observation, so a simple observation was made. The result was that the number of sunspots was found to be 6. During the maximum eclipse, the temperature under the sunlight dropped to 25 degrees Celsius (approximately 77 degrees Fahrenheit). When the sun was fully restored, the temperature under the sunlight rose to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), a difference of as much as 30 degrees. The temperature rose and fell by two or three degrees every five minutes. As for the air temperature, there was only a three-degree difference (Celsius) before and after the eclipse. The change in air pressure was very slight, only 0.3 hao."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>

<p>Thirteen Wandering to Shanghai</p>
<p>This lengthy explanation effectively removed most of Qiu Haitang's worries.</p>
<p>"Dad really, when I and Meng Lao Zhang were getting ready to leave, even that Shang Lao Er's attitude was much better than before!" When Zou Yukun was lighting a cigarette, Mei Xi finally couldn't help but interject.</p>
<p>"Why is that?" Qiu Haitang's confusion was genuine, he felt the matter was truly strange.</p>
<p>"This is the benefit of me, your second brother, doing things for you without any ambiguity!" He held a cigarette between the fingers of his right hand, with a rather smug look, and said: "Shang Lao Er's daring to mess around like that was nothing more than for two things: first, because he was poor. When a person is desperately poor, they can't help but want to find every possible way to make money; second, he only knew that you were also someone who had worked in the theater, but he didn't know that we were students of the Yuzhen Troupe. With so many fellow disciples from our Yuzhen Troupe, could he deal with them? So, on the day Lao Meng set off, I immediately wrote a letter to Tang Zhenxiang without your knowledge -- that is, the one from our next class who sings old men roles very well -- telling him to send someone to find Shang Lao Er, first give him two hundred dollars, and honestly tell him who Mei Bao's father is, tell him not to let greed cloud his mind, or he won't be able to make a living anywhere in the future! Little Tang had also received favors from me in the past, and had even performed in a few shows with you, wouldn't he do his best to handle it after receiving the letter? As soon as I saw Mei Bao and Little Gouzi come back, I knew that Shang Lao Er's side was already taken care of. Otherwise, could things have gone so quickly if we had just sent Old Meng alone?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qiu Haitang was so grateful that he didn't know what to do. (230)</p>

<h3>Evening Prayer Four One-Act Plays</h3>
<p>— Naohiko</p>
<p>Readers who have read Zhu Leijun's "Flying for the Motherland" probably have some impression! This book sold very well, and the number of performances was also quite high. "Evening Prayer" is his second collection of one-act plays, recently published. "Evening Prayer" contains four one-act plays:</p>
<p>(1) "Mr. Madouling's Class" is a new type of comedy, telling the story of an old and kind middle school teacher who opposes cramming-style forced education and strives to promote reforms in a school with extremely poor material conditions. As a result, he encounters obstacles everywhere and makes countless jokes. The play culminates in a neurotic student proposing to the principal's daughter, causing the principal to fly into a rage. The author puts a lot of effort into embellishment, leaving people in admiration.</p>
<p>(2) "Evening Prayer" is similar in style to "Flying for the Motherland." The story unfolds on a quiet and magnificent stage: The newly appointed Minister of Civil Affairs of Lithuania brings a revolutionary party member awaiting trial into his home. This person is none other than Ke Lai, the former lover of the Minister's wife. The Minister allows them a quarter of an hour to talk. Ke Lai is very understanding of his wife's predicament and shows no resentment during the conversation. However, Dai Ni (the Minister's wife), encouraged by a dual love, cleverly swaps the poisoned wine intended for Ke Lai and dies by taking poison amid the desolate and tragic sounds of the evening prayer bells.</p>
<p>(3) "Mi Chao" is also a comedy. The old master is busy hoarding goods, and the wife is busy playing mahjong. As a result, they lose both their wealth and their people, and the young master is kidnapped. The wife, who represents urban women, is the most wonderful character in the play, busy with both hanging herself and playing mahjong with a clean slate.</p>
<p>(4) "Red Mansion's Second You" is an extremely beautiful literary exercise. Although the author has specified that the play cannot be performed, the writer believes that it is the most successful in terms of plot and dialogue.</p>
<p>It is worth promoting that the author's attitude towards theater is very serious. He always stays close to the bottom level, working tirelessly. He has neither the ambition to reach the hall of elegance nor the expectation of reward, so these plays are completely written for small theater groups.</p>
<h3>Qingyun Chess Club Established</h3>

Fellow enthusiasts are welcome to join the club.</p>
<p>Sketches of Movie Stars</p>
<h3>(24) Mickey Rooney</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>He was crowned movie emperor last year, and still holds the highest box office record. This success is by no means accidental, so his acting skills have reached the highest level. He appeared on stage with his parents in a comedy when he was eleven months old. At the age of four, he played a small role in the play "Not to be Trusted," which was very suitable for his innate conditions. He first stepped onto the screen at the age of five. It was not until he starred in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" that he began to attract attention. Now he has leaped to the top of Hollywood. He is very fond of music, especially playing the kettle drums very well. Unfortunately, he cannot grow taller, which everyone regrets for him. He often goes to social events with Linda Darnell, and seems to be thinking about love. His recent work is "Boys Town," co-starring with Spencer Tracy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama School's "A Marriage of Wits" Highlights</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>There are many family ethics plays in Peking Opera, all of which express the love between husband and wife in detail. For example, the old couple in "Qingfeng Pavilion" can care for each other during arguments; the middle-aged couple in "Baolian Lantern," while protecting their children, can still remember "Don't hurt our relationship over two servants"; the young couple in "Selling Horses," the scene of writing the complaint, the situation in the boudoir, is gentle as a painting, especially touching, and the most intoxicating is "A Marriage of Wits," which depicts the feelings of young men and women in the boudoir in great detail, and is a rare masterpiece. Xun Huisheng and Xiao Cuihua each have their own strengths in this play. It is a pity that they are getting old. Although their acting skills are good, it seems inappropriate for people in their forties to pretend to be young children. The entire play has eight books, from visiting the son-in-law to farming, and takes sixteen hours to perform. All the highlights are only seen in the scenes of teaching darts, telling jokes, bidding farewell, and going down the mountain, so ordinary performances that are not complete are all named after "Male and Female Darts." The other day, I watched the students of the drama school perform this play. Zhang Zhengfang played Di Yunluan, and Xue Zhengkang played Lu Kunjie. The young couple were pleasing to the eye. Zhang Zhengfang's strength can directly chase Huisheng. In the teaching darts scene, the dialogue is completely based on improvisation. The arguments about teachers and "girls versus boys" are the most difficult to say fluently. If you are not careful, you will stumble. Those with weak articulation dare not try it lightly. Shang Xiaoyun's "Male and Female Darts" used Xiao Cuihua to play Di Yunluan in the past, but now it is played by Furongcao. Xun Huisheng's "A Marriage of Wits" cannot shine without Lang Xiayu of Furongcao. Therefore, only Tong Shan can master both Yunluan and Xiayu. On that day, the two scenes of saying goodbye to the mother and arguing at home were the most tense. Gu Zhengqiu's cry of "My son, where are you!" moved the entire audience. Zhang Zhengfang's kneeling and reporting section showed the tenderness of mother and daughter and the love between husband and wife. She was reluctant to leave her mother, but also reluctant to abandon her husband, and cried softly, which was very touching. The little girl can already act, which is very cute. The most commendable thing is that she entered the stage on high clogs from beginning to end. This shows that the students of the opera school do not cut corners. Lian Quan is old, and Mao Shilai's stilt skills dominated for a while. If Zhengfang works hard and makes progress, she will not be taken lightly five years from now. Gu Zhengqiu is a special talent of the drama school. Her talent is beyond her peers. Her roles as Qingyi have been well-received by society. Her performance as Lang Xiayu is excellent. The farewell scene is very moving. She is somewhat similar to Xiaoyun, which is not achieved in a day. The other supporting roles are also well-arranged. After watching the play, I have great expectations for the future of the drama school.</p>

As long as I go, he will not dare to release my father." Then he waved for the messenger to leave. The next morning, another scout from the capital rushed back, reporting into the tent. Sangui saw that the scout looked a little flustered, and hesitated to speak. He quickly opened his mouth and asked, "Is Mrs. Chen well?" The scout replied, "Unfortunately, Mrs. Chen was captured by Chuang's general Liu Zongmin and offered to the King of Hell." When Sangui heard this, it was as if a ladle of cold water had been poured over his head, and he did not know whether he felt sour, pain, bitter, or spicy. The pain was more piercing than hearing the bad news of Emperor Chongzhen's martyrdom, and there was no way to describe it. He immediately jumped up, pointed at the scout, and asked, "You... you... are you sure you are not mistaken? How was Mrs. Chen captured by Li Chuang? You must not falsely report this matter, and you must find out the details clearly." The scout was terrified to see Sangui so anxious, and carefully said, "I dare not falsely report, I came to report after I found out the details. When Li Chuang broke into the palace, countless palace people committed suicide or fled. The remaining palace women were all of ordinary beauty. Li Chuang then asked the eunuchs, why are there no beautiful women among the three thousand in the imperial garden? The eunuchs replied that the late emperor shunned sensuality, so there were not many beauties in the palace, except for a Jiangnan beauty named Chen Yuanyuan, who possessed peerless beauty. The state father Tian once offered her to the emperor, but the emperor did not favor her because he was worried about state affairs, and sent her back to the Tian family. Later, I heard that Tian gave her to General Wu. After hearing this, Li Chuang asked the old general for her. The old general was initially unwilling to give her up, but later Chuang's general Liu Zongmin searched the house, and Mrs. Chen hid in the hidden wall."
