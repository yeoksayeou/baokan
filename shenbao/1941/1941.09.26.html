<h3 id="c24">中立法的修改或廢止 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>當本月廿三日美海長諾克斯在新　艦麻州號下水典禮的演說當中，曾經表示：「吾人與中立法爲戲之時已過去</p>
<p>中立法已非復吾人之資產而爲吾人之偵務」。就目前的國際動態來看，情形確是如此。</p>
<p>追溯中立法的產生，正是一九三五年義國準備侵略阿比西尼亞，歐陸危機正緊的時候。彼時前次歐戰所給予美人的反感方極强烈。不再捲入戰爭漩禍乃成爲一般人的普遍要求於是乃於當年八月在國會中通過了臨時中立法、規定總統得以命令禁止運輸軍火及軍用品到交戰國，並禁止美船直接或間接載運此類物品到交戰國。甚至連美人乘坐交戰國船隻也都在禁止之列。此其用意，自然是爲了美國自身的安全，杜絕一切可使戰爭逼近美國的途徑，但另一方面，却對　略者與被侵略者一視同仁，亳不顧及美國在國際正義上所負的責任，在義阿戰爭中，國聯對義制裁的失效，這一中立法案至少要負相當責任的。到次年一月，原案期滿。旋於二月間將原案略加修改，將其有效時期延長到一九三七年五月一日。此次修改中比較重要的一點，就是把美洲國家劃歸例外，如果美洲各國與西半球外各國發生戰爭，美洲各國可不受本法案的束縛。可見當時美國已看出該法案的重大缺陷，但　仍絕不肯爲了美國以外的問題，多冒一點正義的風險，這一點，曾經引起了美國朝野內外人士的嚴重抨擊。及至一九三七年該法案再度滿期的時候，又有過很大的爭辯，但結果除却加入付現自運的條款適用於軍火以外的原料而外，對該法案本質並無變動，且更將該法案變成永久的性質，被時西班牙的人民陣綫與叛軍鏖戰正烈。遠東的中日扣瀕於決裂的前夜，但這一新的中立法却徒然便利了有錢有船的侵略者，並未絲毫爲被侵略國家和人民設身處地着想，中日戰事爆發後，幸而美當局始終不肯援用該項法案，以是中國尙未直接受到中立法的惡果，但那一法案的存在，却無形中窒礙着美國參與國際聯合制裁侵略的遂行。到一九三九年春，西班牙政府軍已瀕貼危，歐洲則戰機益迫，不只美國大多數主持正義的人士業已提出廢止該法案的呼聲，即在羅斯福總統也認爲有加以修改的必要。其間關於禁運軍火的條款廢止問題，幾終爭執，終以孤立份子的梗阻而被擱置，直到此度歐戰爆發之後，纔於十一月初通過修正案，廢止軍火禁運的條款，把現購自運原則通用於軍火，卻依舊禁止美輸駛入戰區，且對於侵略者與被侵略者亦仍無所分別，這自然並未消除其不合理的本質，但按之當時美國內部的情勢，已經是最大限度的修改了。</p>
<p>這一中立法案的存在，固然符合美人「光榮的孤立」的信條，但又正和美國已往所堅決主張的海上自由及中立國權利的傳統相違反：安全與和平都不可分割、以近代戰具與交通技術的進步，任何國家都絕沒有閉關自守不問理亂的可能。更何况美國國土雖與世界其他部分相隔絕，在政治經濟關係上則密切的與世界各個角落相聯繫。在自身利益向外，更在國際條約和正義人道方面負有重大義務和責任。以是當去夏英法不幸在西綫敗北。中立法就已失去了了存在的理由，但羅斯福以下的美當局。他們甯自別闢蹊徑以遂行援助民治國家打擊侵略的任務，而不願呆板的把時問精神耗廢在立法的爭執與無謂的爭辯。諸如租借法案的成立，巡邏範圍的擴大，冰島格林蘭島的收管，對蘇貸款的成立，羅邱宣言的發布、以及最近儘先射擊德義艦艇的命令，在精神上早已超出了中立法案所要防杜的參戰危險有千里之遙，而在形式上則處處並不與該法案的條款有所抵觸。有如美輪的駛赴紅海，必須先之以否認該地帶爲交戰區城，即可見美當局不得不在夾縫中尋覓出路的一斑。尤其滑稽的，美國開赴冰島的商輪，因爲避免違反中立法規定　都不得不改在巴拿馬註册，爲數竟達一百二十五艘之多，這一事實直到最近北大西洋美輪常遭德艇擊沉纔大白於世。這足見美當局的苦心，同時亦更可見中立法存在的不合理。而若干更進一步的迫切任務，有如美輪直駛英國，商船的實行武裝，在巡邏區域以外的軍艦護航，則都格於該法案的條款而無法遂行，於此益可見修改或廢止中立法案在今日之不容或緩。</p>
<p>現在美國參戰呼聲雖甚囂塵上，但除非國際間再發生更重大的變動而外，此舉尙嫌過早，加以孤立份子縱見失勢，却未絕跡，也許美當局暫將提出修改中立法案的建議。俾使援助英蘇與打擊德義的任務能充分有效的實行，適當四十萬萬新租軍經費提出國會之際、此舉自屬必要。至於遠東，已往固未因中立法的存在而在實際上遭到重大損害，其修改或取消當亦不致多所影響；只是中立法如能根本廢止，實足表示美國已具不惜一戰的充分決心，再不是任何玩弄戰爭者所能嚇退　對於遠柬以至世界危局的澄淸，當具有若干重大的微妙功效。</p>

<p>近來棉紗現貨市塲之波濤洶湧、升一降、使人驚懼、實則多空兩方見仁見智、見解不同也、賣者謂國際局勢尙在幻變莫測、認爲紗價底盤、已人高檔、心意傾向於拋出、至於買者之論調、一以雜牌紗價逐步提高、而港幫需求殷切、二則棉花價昂、在此申請購訂外棉未定之時、二十支原料每担價須售四百五十元至八十元、由此一來、成本有關、廠方不願開售、所以在市吸收廠單、可想多空角逐之劇烈、不知鹿死誰手也、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况　形勢轉穩、起伏極爲狹小、全日高低僅六七元之差、當上午開出、雖洋花再升、廠單高出十餘元、而期紗近期因隔昨先事收盤、未遭打擊、故買方尙有納意、但無力再拉之象、是以爲一六六二元做開、尙降六元、十一月期爲六七八元、亦降五元、而遠期則多方鑒於低價吸收、抬爲一七一四元開盤、回上四元、入後廠單果又上游、而未能引起期紗人心之興奮、蓋變幻倏忽之廠單、使般憑藉者、如驚弓之烏、一時不敢隨之而進、致交易未旺、市氣盤旋、午後因現貨與取引所仍又挺進、人心較爲活動、散空略有補進、浮多亦稍收進、樓面微硬、十月份高至一六六九元、十一月份升達六八二元、十二月期漲至一七一七元、但一般賣戶、突叉逢高來出、遂又軋小二三元、結果近月爲一六六六元五角收盤、尙跌一元五角、十一月份爲一六七九元、亦跌四元、十二月期爲一七一四元、獨升四元、茲將經過市價、例表於後、</p>

<p>— 馮柳瑩</p>
<p>屯積（一）</p>
<p>戰事以來，物價屢累而上，迄為猶無止境；當然，亦為統制來源，貨運失暢，供求不調，苛捐勒索，橫徵暴例　，貨本愈高的影響，及黑滙行市漸縮原因。然而屯積居奇之愈出愈凶，遂使物價脫離貨幣的　勒，無限制地升漲上去，亦是最重要的一種因素。</p>
<p>屯積本是商業上一種自然作用，亦是富欺貧一種剝削手段，原不足奇。然所以為世唾罵，正為其貪心無　足，拼命地將物吸收，不絕他將物價抬高，壓迫大眾生活喘不過氣來，甚至為維持生存而拋妻棄子，殺嬰煮孩，種咱喪風敗俗的舉動，慘無人道的人世事，俱為少數有材有勢損人利已一念所造成。然以有涯之生，逐無窮之欲，徒快一時享用，而暗中造孽無窮，清夜反躬，亦知何必孳孳利來。</p>
<p>世人多屯積，而不究屯積之由來；余未嘗屯積，於今偏欲談屯積，得無令　腹費齒冷以為措大偏喜隔靴搔癢。雖然，余所談，非為市場上之屯積，而為文字上之屯積，文字上之屯積，為屯積者所不能談；我雖無能，而固不妨一談。</p>
<p>屯積，通作囤積，余以屯積為是。　需囤者，代　編成之　條，盤圈而止，用以貯米。亦有用稻柴編成直徑三四尺高約一尺許之草囤，層累之以藏米，無論其用竹用柴，俱稱之為米囤。囤者名詞也，與囷相近，觀其形，亦可知其義。在一方圍之中，而禾居其內，非為儲米之器而何。囷之字為古，囤之字較後，蓋囤从囗从屯，因從屯字而来，因其為屯積之器，故於屯之外，加一方圍，以明其為器；又惟其作用為屯，故其意義仍从屯。</p>
<p>屯積，一種動作也，若以囤相稱則不動。蓋屯者聚也；積者居也；聚貨物而居積之，屯積之本意也。屯，本音豚，俗多作豚这上聲讀。亦可讀作頓，故江浙問頗讀屯作頓字音曰頓貨。</p>

<p>江海關於昨日發表有關禁運物品赴自由區之第三十三號佈吿、略謂「自一九四一年九月二十五日起、所有貨品、一概禁止由上海運往非淪陷區仟何口岸及城市、但輪船航行所需之貨物、則不在禁止之列、即祈注意、幷一體遵照辦理」、此一公告、乃由海關總務科日稅務司授權所發、</p>
<p>海外口岸　仍得自由</p>
<p>海關佈吿中對於非淪陷區究指何地、未予說明、唯據消息靈通人士聲稱、此舉目的完全在於禁止任何物品輸往中國自由區、對於香港·仰光·馬尼刺·及海外口岸、仍得自由出口、但不得與英美凍結中日資金後日方爲報復而採取之禁運辦法相抵觸、換言之、除日方發行規定之十餘種貨物外、出口品運往外洋、均不在禁化範圍之內、貨物運往香港、雖未禁止、但須倍加轉口稅、以示限制、唯以後情形如何、尙難料、</p>
<p>貨物內運　無虞中斷</p>
<p>因香港口岸不在禁運之列、故事實上貨物仍得由香港轉口赴目由區、在此方面、對自由區貿易顯無任何影響、僅加重轉口稅而巳、但在另一方面、上海貨物經由浙江福建海口內運者、將有斷絕之虞、蓋目前滬浙滬閩航運業已中斷、實則貨物仍能設法經此兩路運入自由區、故此次禁止貨物運至非淪陷區、恐係指由浙閩轉運內地之貨物、遭受打擊者、自以對浙閩之出口貨物爲限、但以後上海對　之輸出貨物必形增多、故禁運貨物赴自由區之舉、終屬徒然、上海與內地問之貿易、必不致蒙受惡劣之影響、</p>
<p>對平準會　報復行動</p>
<p>據消息靈通之商界人士透露、此次由日方授意宣佈禁運貨物赴內地、實爲對中國外滙平準基金委員會之報復手段、蓋平準會禁止中國資金由香港流入淪陷區及上海、按平準基金委員會爲維護上海友邦幽家貿易、決定按照美匯五元三四三七五及英匯三辦士一八七五之價格供給外滙、此舉乃本凍結會之要義、對日方商業未始不爲一慘酷打擊、同時又竭力防止中國資金流人淪陷區域包括上海在內、因此日方遂禁止物品運人自由區以爲報復、此足徵中芙美三國對日本已展開劇烈之經濟戰爭、</p>
<p>現紗實銷　依然暢旺</p>
<p>禁運一舉、影響於中英美棉紡廠商者至重且大、因棉布棉紗運往內地、將多少遭遇困難也、但日方棉紡廠、則絕不受影響因日貨早經禁止運往非淪陷區、故在禁運宜佈之始、棉紗市價大跌、此實係投機商乘風作浪所致、但昨日起、綠棉紗禁止出口運往非淪陷區一事、對於實際銷路並無影響（香港一路可通）、且港帮零星採辦仍未間斷、故現紗市況、昨又漲、</p>

<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>此時此地，有飯吃已是幸事，何必吃得太飽？目前脹死的人還是有的，但他們並非應該如此；所以如此，於是餓死一班人。</p>
<p>我們在這裏要求足以維持生命的生活資料那倒不是苛求，然而大都一直瘦下去了。人民的營養問題眞是現實最嚴重的一个。不要說街頭的流浪者，他們身上缺乏維他命ABCD，就是最近一班學生羣中，巳有很多營養不良的「太瘦生」，甚至都已變成肺癆病者。這百分比是可怕的。</p>
<p>當你由營養不良而成爲病人的時候，更急切地要來等待醫治，但現在吃磅魚肝油就得廿五元，打什麼賜保命更不得了。去偶而請敎醫生，開出藥方便使你病情加重！</p>
<p>毋庸諱言，一班高貴的醫生似都鑽在象牙之塔裹，深夜拒診算是身份，白天去掛號，黑夜姍姍來遲、。要是診金加倍拔號，就可來得早些，甚或馬上來。</p>
<p>但醫生據說具有割股之心是自古有之的，「痼瘝在抱」的良醫，似非自我作古。做醫生的像煞並非慈善工作，然而即使是「國手」，要是以瓖寳自重，叫平民却步，那倒最自私不過。有些前輩良醫，不治產，病人不啻家人，臨床唯恐不盡吾心，至今膾炙人口，馨香稱頌不已；某種時醫，窮親戚的診金還不折不扣，以示大公無私（？），其實他積錢千萬，仍是何苦來。</p>
<p>日前報載儲麟蓀醫院主辦中國保健會，其宣言倒是一張眞藥方：「……將全國的醫生和重要的藥品一概收歸國有，支配需要的救命的藥品，不能讓人操縱！醫生不是自由職業，是社會的公僕。醫藥的目標是增進健康消滅疾病，不是奢侈品。」此言出諸本行之口，確是沈痛之至。願本此初衷，勇往直前，予人共見，爲社會造福，則幸甚！</p>
<h3 id="c93">爲揩油問題　售票員申訴痛苦 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>頃接英商電車公司售票員吳光吳聲等來函，他們說「這是我們一個集體的要求，是售票員要說而沒有機會說的話。」我們自極同情，所以我們把來函刋在下面。</p>
<p>項東川跌車斃命，是任何人應該關心應該援助的。王萬祥揩油與否，是事實問題，也是法律問題，在事件發生之初，眞相未完全明瞭以前，自難斷定，可是日前法院審判的時候，捕房律師會請處王以刑罪，這巳可見此案之大概，當然王萬祥如果是完全受不白之寃，市民也應代爲洗雪的。</p>
<p>這件來函刊載之後，我們對於王萬祥案，準備靜待法院公正的判決，如有同樣性質之函件，恕不繼續刋載。</p>
<p>自從英商電車公司售票員三五八號王萬祥跌斃乘客項東川案發生以來，一般上海市民及各報與論均羣起責難，我們對於社會有識人仕之意見，大致上並不反對，但我們始終認爲遺憾的，是輿論界並沒有負起敎育上的責任，更沒有把問題分析起來。</p>
<p>售票員王萬祥是否應負起法律上的責仟和是非黑白，終有水落日出的一天，此爲法律問題，我們暫姑不諭及，我們所欲向全上海市民及輿論界有所申訴者爲我售票員之生活實况：這裏第一所謂對於售票員的揩油問題，當有所說明，在全市市民目光裏公司卑價一漲而再漲，全諷爲是售票員揩油而漲的，但是上海的公用事業那一項不是一漲而再漲，法商的電車售票員，是誰都知道是不揩油的，爲什麼他的車價，並沒有比英商便宜呢？如果在英商電車當局對行政上還未取得一個適當的改進辦法，儘管加添查票員，而不在根本上去改善每一員工之最低限度生活待遇，與協同有組織的優良售票員的合作，要根絕這三十餘年來之習俗的行爲，根本是不可能，尤其是在生活高漲下的今日。第二售票員的一般態度問題，我們相信在同是中國同胞面前來談這個問題，是較容易的，在這裏乘客可以細細的想一想，在車廂內乘客少的時候，我們的態度不是非常和氣嗎，在乘客擁擠的時候，稍有一些不好態度是有的，但這不好的態度，並非是有意同乘客作對，又不是同乘客有什麽深仇，况乘客間優劣不等，有的上車不購車票，致被查票員發覺，因此而遭公司之處罰，往往不下一二十元，此項痛苦，社會人仕間是否了解我們的隱痛，絲毫沒有得到一些社會人仕之體諒和同情。</p>
<p>我們的申訴如果能在貴報上刋登，這是我們一個集體的要求，是我們大多數售票員要說而沒有機會說的話。售票員吳光吳聲等上。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 慕風</p>
<p>在我將畢業的那年，父親不幸生病死了。母親決定叫我輟學就業。媽和我奔走的結果，不是遭白眼，定是婉言拒絕，經過了一個時日，媽的小姊妹二姨姨，答應介紹我做各侍應生</p>
<p>一個晴朗的下午，二姨姨帶我上一家大酒店——它便是我工作的地方——鋼骨水泥的建築物，裏面富麗堂皇，幽揚的音樂，時起時伏，摩登仕女們，挽着臂，進進出出，二姨姨和我也就在人羣中走進了這大酒店。我們守了個把鐘頭，很好客易才會見了賬房×先生，一個三十左右的中年人，頭髮梳得光光的，穿一套淡灰色西裝，二姨姨和他客氣了幾句，就把來意說明，於是他把那雙大得可怕的眼睛在我身上打了個轉說：</p>
<p>「樣子很不錯，不過好像太老實了。」</p>
<p>「是呀！我也這末說，無論如何，總要請你幫忙的，我們是有數的。」二姨姨忙接上</p>
<p>「好吧！二小姐，看你的面子，哈……喂！明天來上班好了。」說完一逕走去了。</p>
<p>回家的路上，承二姨姨關切的隆情，敎了我不少待人接物的門徑，並且再三可囑我明天多搽些粉和胭脂，好好打扮一下，假如衣服沒有，她可以借給我，我全答應了。</p>
<p>現在我開始過新生活——一種說不出味兒的生活，整日在酒味菜氣的餐室中伺候着大人，太太，少爺，小姐們，穿來穿去，忙起來，飯也沒工夫吃，空的時候，又不准你走開</p>
<p>X先生老是釘着我瞧大眼睛，骨溜溜的，阿英暗底下吿訴我說：「他是一個壞蛋，專想吃豆腐，看上去，他在轉你的念頭。」</p>
<p>「喂！Boy，不，Girl，快來。」，快來。」</p>
<p>「來了，來了，」</p>
<p>「來呀！×號」年青的傢伙又在招呼我了，他穿着白西服，用手招招接着對他的朋友說：「這是漂亮的一個，新來的。」我已走到餐桌邊。</p>
<p>「你等在這裏，讓我們想想」他說：</p>
<p>「喂！你們說她像誰？」他問着他的朋友們。</p>
<p>「不！麥唐納。」辯護着說</p>
<p>「全不對，像嘉寳，瞧！眼睛不是頂像的嗎？」呵呵……一陣大笑。</p>
<p>「先生們，究竟要什麽？」我忍着氣，裝了笑容問。</p>
<p>「呵，呵……要，要你站在這裏讓我們瞧。」他們很自然的說，並目笑得更萬害。</p>
<p>我麻木了，呆呆地低着頭站着，突然一隻粗魯的手，在我肩上一拍，接著一卷東西在我手中一塞，我抬頭看時，這幾個瘋在的傢伙，巳走下樓梯了，我將手中東西拿起一看，這是二張十元的鈔票，上面附着一張紙條兒，上寫「今晚×華等你，千萬勿誤。」</p>
<p>天呵，這是什么一回事。</p>

<p>— 渠淸</p>
<p>圍棋爲吾國國粹之一，齊梁之世最稱鼎盛，蕭道成蕭衍二人，皆嗜此這，一時朝士習染成風，人才輩出，其盛况可於南齊書梁書北史中見其片鱗殘爪。所惜史家紀戰未詳，而當時圖譜無一流傳，不能與後世棋家較其優劣。唐宋以還棋事甚爲寥落，僅於流傳不廢而已。淸代有過百齡氏（過氏乃明代遺民）整理舊譜，創製新圖（即仙機武庫及四子譜等）徐星友氏首創棋評，（即兼山堂亦譜）弈道始有復興之勢。黃龍士先生在康熙初年，量爲傑出，近人評定吾國棋藝，古今以來，未有超過黃龍士者。（黃名虬，字龍士，泰州人，十餘歲即成國手，杜茶村變雅堂文集，有贈黃之序，後改名霞，字月天）。康熙至乾隆初，國手如林，時稱梁（魏今）程（蘭如）施（襄夏）范（西屏）爲魁。乾隆末年稍衰，當時僅有第二手而無第一手。（見閱微草堂筆記）同光之際，陳子仙周小松最爲有聲，但小松每對人言，自承如遇施范，必不能敵，小松下世後，遂無繼起者。至清末民初，益爲勘藝衰落時期焉</p>
<p>近世幸有閩人吳淸源氏，十六歲巳能壓倒一時各手，乃東渡留學，與彼邦人士切磋琢磨，苦心發明，天元三連星諸陣勢，一時棋風爲之丕變。書坊舊譜，幾至無人問津，東洋人稱其弈品有棋聖秀策之作風，又目爲怪童，（即神童之意）又稱爲花棋國手；（即四四及十四與中心等位棋盤皆有花爲記，又稱爲黑無敵，居東數年，品第猛晋，至二十二歲時因體弱遵醫囑，暫作休養，並曾回國，小住數月，其休養期間約一二年，雖不與外界較角，而孳孳求進之志，迄未稍懈。及再出應敵，棋風尤爲峻厲，最近與木谷實君（前年木谷君曾勝九段本因坊秀哉）十局　，以勝六局占先，復由報界推舉僅存之老八段雁金準一君，出而比賽，的定十局，第一局最新披露，雁金君執黑已中押</p>
<p>其十局之成績，固可想像而知。吳氏在東洋稱七段棋士論，其實力觀其戰績，必已臥九段無疑。而與前代之黃龍士先生堪爲伯仲也。且今方爲二十八歲之靑年，品格性情，均極優美，將來更有進境，不可限量。吾國圍棋界之有吳氏，無異景星慶雲，無怪乎國內弈家談及吳氏之事，輒不勝欣幸興奮之意焉。</p>

<p>— 周貽白</p>
<p>年飯吃完，大家都興高彩烈預備過年，尤其是那些未成年的小弟妹們，忙得更起勁。覺新回到自己的房間，看見盆中的梅花，又看了看以前梅表妹替他畫的一副帳簷，他有點黯然了。同時，覺慧和鳴鳳，也在廳前相遇，正擬互訴衷情，却被他的妹妹淑英把嗚鳳叫去了，因此，覺慧的心裏也有點不快樂。最幸福的，却是覺民和張蘊華，他們同在一個房間，談得頭頭是道，好像兩顆心已經溶台爲一了。</p>
<p>覺新與梅，是旣成的慘局，本來兩不相聞了。不料梅另嫁之後，却在很短的期間內，死了丈夫，重又回到娘家來了。於是此一對寃家，叉相遇在一處，久而久之，李瑞珏也知道了這件事。她雖然很同情梅的境遇，但是沒有方法解決這項糾紛，她曾經一度向梅表白，願意自己讓避，讓梅和覺新結合。可是梅却不敢答應，認爲這未免太損人利己了。</p>
<p>而覺慧一方面，他不但爲了愛嗚鳳而忘記了自己的身份，他甚至坦白地吿訴嗚鳳，他將正式娶她爲妻子。這在嗚鳳一方面，自然是喜出望外，她也吿訴覺慧，她是受過覺慧的大姐的敎誨的。自從覺慧的大姐死去，她除了她的母親之外，只愛着覺慧一個人。她表示她將爲覺慧奮鬥到底，決不以爲自己是奴婢而肯輕易屈服。</p>
<p>至於覺民與張蘊華，雖然巳經心心相印，但對於人事的難料，頗感到一種憂煩。不過他們自己都很相信，這一段姻緣，決不會和覺新與梅那樣，假令眞和覺新與梅的障碍相同，他們也不　輕易分手。因爲蘊華的意志較　　　强，面覺民也比他的大哥有決斷力。</p>

<p>吳三桂見二人都是一般的英俊少年，心裏十分歡喜，當面立授把總之職，和張陳等同在帳下供職。二人謝過恩。吳三桂因聞許靖是從寗武關來此的，遂敎二人坐了，問問流寇的情形。許靖一一回答，說流寇勢力日大，自是可憂，然而可憂的地方官吏不能彼此聯絡，用堅壁淸野的方法對付他們。而朝廷派出的統軍大吏，又都是忽剿忽撫，宗旨不定，沒有當機立斷的決心，而士卒又都不肯用命，所以敵不過流寇了。且各地人民因連年飢饉之故，迫於飢寒，蠢蠢思動，流寇一至，自有許多地痞遊勇難民之流，做他們內應，往往羣起響應，所以其勢如火之燎原，不可嚮邇了。三桂聽了，也以爲是。張蒼此又道：「將軍奉朝廷聖旨，調兵人關去剿流寇，自是緊要之事。然而滿洲挾其方興之勢，虎視鷹瞵，時時想來侵犯，現在的暫安是不足恃的。一旦將軍統率大兵入關，他們豈有不乘隙而動之理？末將恐將軍雄師朝入山海關，而滿洲鐵騎夕馳寗遠了。三桂聽了，點點頭道：「張把總之言未嘗不是。但我若入關，這裏的防務也未可輕棄，當令柴遊擊留守於此，以防萬一。現在的形勢眞是非常危急，對外旣不可忽略，對內尤如救火，不容遲緩。皇上無兵可調，所以召我入關拱衛京師。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battles Unfold in Northern Hunan: Japanese Forces Heavily Mauled on Both Banks of the Miluo River; Advancing Japanese Troops Everywhere Encountered Resistance from Chinese Forces; Chinese Forces in Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces Launch Attacks to Tie Down Japanese Troops <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The battle situation in northern Hunan has reached a fever pitch. Yesterday, Chinese forces engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops everywhere in the area west of Pingjiang and east of Dongting Lake, on both banks of the Miluo River, advancing wave upon wave, disregarding personal safety. Japanese troop casualties on both banks of the Miluo River were very heavy, and the river water was completely red. Fierce fighting was especially intense in Tingjiang southwest of Pingjiang and Lulin Tan across from Xiangyin. A unit of Japanese troops attempted to infiltrate Jinjing yesterday, but was mostly annihilated by a large force of Chinese troops. The Chinese Air Force also flew to the front lines yesterday to assist in the battle. It is believed here that the battle situation has reached a decisive stage, and it is expected that the main force of the Japanese army will be annihilated north of Changsha. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to recent battle reports from the front lines, the situation on the Hunan front is now particularly strained. The Japanese army is currently attempting to probe south towards Changsha in several directions. The Japanese army, currently concentrated in the Xinshi, Wugongshi, and Yukou areas on the south bank of the Miluo River, numbers 20,000 troops. They resumed their offensive on September 23. The left flank of the Japanese army at Yukou advanced southeast, reaching the main road near Lijiangpu on the west side of Pingjiang. Fierce fighting is currently underway in that area, with Chinese troops fighting desperately to resist. The central route of the Japanese army at Wugongshi is currently advancing south and southeast. The left flank of the Japanese army at Xinshi is advancing southwest. At the same time, Japanese warships and aircraft are still heavily bombarding Chinese military positions on the southeastern shore of Dongting Lake, attempting to cover the Japanese landing near Yingtian, but all have been bravely repelled by Chinese forces under machine gun and bomb fire. The Japanese army is currently using giant tank units in an attempt to break through the Chinese defensive fortifications on the shore. Chinese forces in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces are now launching offensives to tie down the Japanese army. Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi have crossed the Xiushui River and are currently attacking the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway near Yongxiu. Chinese forces in northern Hubei are currently attacking Suixian County. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military news: (1) On the south bank of the Miluo River, Japanese troops continued to increase on the night of the 23rd and continued to flee south in different directions. After Chinese troops fought bravely to resist and fought bloody battles, both Japanese and Chinese casualties were heavy by the 24th. Fierce fighting is still underway near Liqiao, Tuojiabao, and Shichong. (2) West of Pingjiang, near Tingjiang, Japanese troops infiltrated Shiawan (southwest of Pingjiang) on the afternoon of the 23rd and continued to flee towards Jinjing on the 24th. After Chinese troops intercepted them, the battle was extremely fierce. (3) Japanese troops who attacked west from Shiawan on the 23rd infiltrated Jinjing at 11:00 AM on the 25th and continued to flee south. They were bravely intercepted by Chinese troops and have been stopped by the Chinese army in the area north of Gaoqiao. Fierce fighting is underway. (4) Japanese troops who fled from Yukou to Banzhaomiao continued to attack south on the 24th and were stopped by Chinese troops in the Ma’anzui area. An extremely fierce battle broke out, with Chinese troops fighting bloody battles with the Japanese, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese also suffered casualties. Afterwards, the Japanese continued to reinforce and continued to flee towards Tuojiabao (northwest of Jinjing) and Luojiaqiao (northeast of Fulinpu), but were still blocked by the Chinese. Fierce fighting is currently underway. (5) Japanese troops who fled to the Shendingshan and Baishui Station area southwest of Xinshi continued to flee east towards Dongqiao via Xinkaishi on the 25th. They were repeatedly intercepted by Chinese troops, and Japanese casualties were very heavy. Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting in the area near Liqiao. (6) In the morning of the 24th, a portion of the Japanese army took multiple motorboats and fled to the Touzhou area northwest of Yueyang, forcibly landing. After Chinese troops intercepted them, many Japanese soldiers were killed. By evening, the Japanese continued to increase their forces and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese. (7) More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers with three artillery pieces attacked south towards Lingchuan from Yinchengzhen (east of Gaoping) on the morning of the 21st. After Chinese troops counterattacked, many Japanese soldiers were killed. Fighting is still underway. (8) Japanese troops who attacked west from Xinhui infiltrated Danshuikou on the night of the 22nd and infiltrated Sanbu on the night of the 23rd. Chinese and Japanese troops are currently continuing to fight bloody battles in the Dieshu Mountain and Lion Mountain area. (9) The number of Japanese troops who fled to Taishan has gradually increased to 4,000 or 5,000, and they continue to attack Chinese forces. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces in the northwestern area of Taishan. (10) More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers who attacked south from Lianyu Mountain (east of Tongling) and other places on the morning of the 21st were intercepted by Chinese troops. Many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the remaining Japanese troops fled. (11) A portion of the Chinese forces in southern Anhui attacked Japanese troops in Wanzhi and other places on the night of the 23rd, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. They are continuing to fiercely attack the Japanese. (12) When a certain unit of Chinese troops attacked Japanese troops in Baiguan northwest of Xiangshang on the night of the 23rd, they stormed into the Japanese positions in one fell swoop, then turned their attack towards Japanese troops in a certain location, advancing quite smoothly. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Changde: This morning, many Japanese warships and boats infiltrated Hengling Lake via Yan’anshan and Qingshan, and at 8:00 AM, they fiercely bombarded the Doumi Ju area. At the same time, several Japanese aircraft flew to the陣上空, alternately bombing. The Chinese lakefront garrison fought bravely despite the intense bombing by Japanese aircraft. They are still fighting bloody battles. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The focal point of the battle in the Siyi region has now shifted to Sanbu (belonging to Taishan). The suburbs are still under Chinese military control. Japanese troops in the Changsha (this is not Changsha in Hunan Province) area were ambushed by Chinese troops, and more than half were killed or wounded. The remaining troops are being encircled and annihilated by Chinese troops. At noon on the 21st, a portion of the Japanese army broke through the encirclement and fled northwest, attempting to attack Kaiping County. Chinese troops counterattacked near Gangxu, and fierce fighting is underway. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The battle situation in Sanbu is still fierce. This afternoon, Japanese troops in the Changsha (belonging to Kaiping) area were all intercepted by Chinese troops. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military sources here announced today that the war in Hunan Province seems to have entered its most critical stage. The fate of Changsha has not yet been decided. There is also fierce fighting in Guangdong. Military sources say that Chinese and Japanese forces are facing each other between Xiangyin and Pingjiang, northeast of Changsha. The fighting is very fierce. The Japanese are also conducting large-scale air raids on Hengyang in Hunan Province. Hengyang has also been attacked. Hengyang is one of the important transportation centers of Free China south of the Yangtze River and is clearly one of the Japanese army's targets in this offensive in Hunan Province. An official communiqué stated that four Japanese columns are jointly heading towards Changsha east of the railway. There are also landing forces on the west side of the railway. Yesterday, they all made slight progress, but suffered heavy casualties. As for the Japanese column on the east side, they advanced south from Pingjiang via Wengjiang (transliteration), their original strength being 7,000 men. They suffered heavy losses on Monday night. Fierce fighting is still underway in that area. The other three columns are fighting in Yukou, Wushengshi (transliteration), Xinshi, and strongholds on the south bank of the Miluo River. There is also fighting in the Lulin Tan area on both sides of the Xiang River. The Japanese army attempted to land in Yingtian on Tuesday morning but was repelled. Regarding the war in Guangdong, the communiqué stated that the Japanese army that attacked from Xinhui occupied Danshuikou on Monday morning. Danshuikou is located north of Taishan and is the confluence of highways, railways, and rivers. Many overseas Chinese in the United States come from that area. Under government orders, they are carrying millions to relieve the refugees in Taishan. Ma Chaojun, the former mayor of Nanjing, declared that the Japanese army is clearly attempting to establish a new front line west of the Pearl River, going from Guanghai via Taishan, Xinhui, Jiangmen, and Shunde to Guangzhou. The purpose of this move is to cut off the supply line in the Xijiang area. Mr. Ma said that it took the Japanese army two days to advance from Guanghai to Taishan, which shows that the strength of the Chinese army has increased. Mr. Ma also said that the wealthy residents of Taishan, because they had experience in the past, so when about 3,000 Japanese troops advanced north from Guanghai, and another 2,000 advanced west from Jiangmen and Xinhui, jointly approaching Taishan. (United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The fighting in northern Hunan is most intense in the Jinjing area on the right flank. From morning to night, artillery fire could be heard from the front lines. The Chinese army is using the mountainous terrain to intercept and flank Japanese troops fleeing south. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: Japanese troops who fled to Wengjiang were severely attacked by Chinese forces at Yujiaguan, and almost the entire army was wiped out. On the morning of the 23rd, Japanese reinforcements reached more than 8,000 and continued to flee to the area. One unit attacked northeast, invading Pingjiang, and another unit attacked Pintang from the southwest. Fierce fighting broke out in both Pingjiang and Pintang, and the situation is extremely tense. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: There have been no major changes in the battle situation along the Miluo River today. Chinese forces are still severely attacking Japanese troops in the Wengjiang and Xinshi areas. (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Officials here announced yesterday that the Japanese army's blockade of the Chinese coast is only effective during the day in many places. Chinese merchants are engaged in anti-blockade activities, and business is booming. Especially in the 100-kilometer stretch between Macau and Pingwu, hundreds of sandboats travel to and from the Xijiang River all night, transporting supplies and various military necessities from Hong Kong and Macau to the interior of Guangdong.

<p>Changsha: Wang Guisheng, the helmsman of the Su Sanye ferry in Baima Township, Xiangyin, was carrying Platoon Leader Cao Hanzhang of a certain division out to the lake to attack the Japanese when he encountered four Japanese motorboats at Lijia Tai. The forces were vastly unequal, and the Japanese rushed onto the boat. Wang shouted to Platoon Leader Cao, engaging the Japanese in close combat with bayonets. Then he tightened the sail rope and used the wind to capsize the boat, dying together with the Japanese army. Also, when the Japanese army occupied Qingshan, there were more than a dozen passionate young people who vowed not to surrender and made heroic sacrifices together. Chairman Xue Jiao was informed and has ordered the Xiangyin County magistrate to issue a commendation and provide generous compensation. At the same time, he has mobilized the people to actively assist in the war, to advance and retreat together with the National Army, to live and die together, to save the country and save the village, to avenge their hatred, and to strive for victory.

<h3 id="e25">Modification or Abolition of the Neutrality Act <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In a speech delivered on the 23rd of this month at the launching ceremony of the new warship Massachusetts, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated, "The time when we could play with the Neutrality Act is past.</p>
<p>The Neutrality Act is no longer an asset but an encumbrance to us." Looking at the current international situation, this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>Tracing the origins of the Neutrality Act, it was precisely during the time when Italy was preparing to invade Abyssinia in 1935, and the crisis in Europe was intensifying. At that time, the aversion to the previous European war was still extremely strong among Americans. The general demand was to no longer get involved in the quagmire of war. Thus, in August of that year, a temporary Neutrality Act was passed in Congress, stipulating that the President could order the prohibition of transporting arms and military supplies to belligerent nations, and prohibit American ships from directly or indirectly carrying such items to belligerent nations. Even Americans traveling on ships of belligerent nations were prohibited. The intention was naturally for the sake of America's own security, cutting off all paths that could bring war closer to the United States. However, on the other hand, it treated the aggressor and the victim of aggression equally, disregarding the responsibility the United States bore for international justice. In the Italo-Ethiopian War, the failure of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy was at least partially the responsibility of this Neutrality Act. When the original bill expired in January of the following year, it was slightly modified in February, extending its validity until May 1, 1937. An important point in this modification was to classify the Americas as an exception. If American countries were to engage in war with countries outside the Western Hemisphere, American countries would not be bound by this act. It can be seen that at that time the United States had already recognized the major defects of the act, but it still absolutely refused to take even a little risk for justice for issues outside of the United States. This point aroused severe criticism from both the government and the public, both within and outside of America. When the act expired again in 1937, there was much debate, but the result was that, apart from adding the "cash and carry" clause applicable to raw materials other than arms, there was no change to the essence of the act. Moreover, the act was made permanent. At that time, the People's Front and the rebels in Spain were engaged in a fierce battle. In the Far East, China and Japan were on the eve of a split. However, this new Neutrality Act only facilitated the aggressors who had money and ships and did not consider the position of the invaded countries and peoples in the slightest. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, fortunately, the U.S. authorities consistently refused to invoke the act, so China has not directly suffered the ill effects of the Neutrality Act. However, the existence of that act has invisibly hindered the United States from participating in the implementation of international joint sanctions against aggression. By the spring of 1939, the Spanish government forces were on the verge of collapse, and the war in Europe was increasingly imminent. Not only had the majority of people in the United States who upheld justice already called for the abolition of the act, but President Roosevelt also believed that it was necessary to modify it. The issue of abolishing the arms embargo clause was almost always a point of contention and was shelved due to the obstruction of isolationists. It was not until after the outbreak of the European war that an amendment was passed in early November, abolishing the arms embargo clause and applying the "cash and carry" principle to arms. However, it still prohibited American ships from entering war zones and made no distinction between aggressors and victims of aggression. This naturally did not eliminate its irrational nature, but in view of the internal situation in the United States at that time, it was already the maximum extent of modification.</p>
<p>The existence of this Neutrality Act certainly conformed to the American creed of "glorious isolation," but it also contradicted the tradition of maritime freedom and neutral country rights that the United States had firmly advocated in the past. Security and peace are indivisible. With the progress of modern weapons and transportation technology, no country can absolutely close its doors and remain ignorant of right and wrong. Moreover, although the United States is geographically isolated from other parts of the world, it is closely linked to every corner of the world in terms of political and economic relations. In addition to its own interests, it also bears significant obligations and responsibilities in terms of international treaties and justice and humanity. Therefore, when Britain and France unfortunately lost on the Western Front last summer, the Neutrality Act lost its reason for existence. However, the American authorities under Roosevelt preferred to explore other paths to carry out the task of assisting democratic countries in combating aggression, rather than rigidly wasting time and energy on legislative disputes and meaningless debates. For example, the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act, the expansion of patrol ranges, the acquisition of Iceland and Greenland, the establishment of loans to the Soviet Union, the issuance of the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, and the recent order to shoot at German and Italian warships first were all, in spirit, far beyond the danger of participation in the war that the Neutrality Act sought to prevent. Formally, they did not violate the provisions of the act. For example, American ships sailing to the Red Sea must first deny that the area is a war zone. This shows the difficulties the American authorities face in seeking a way out. Particularly ridiculous is that American commercial ships heading to Iceland had to be registered in Panama to avoid violating the provisions of the Neutrality Act. The number reached as many as 125. This fact was not widely known until recently, when American ships in the North Atlantic were frequently sunk by German submarines. This shows the painstaking efforts of the American authorities, and it also shows the irrationality of the existence of the Neutrality Act. Certain more pressing tasks, such as American ships sailing directly to Britain, the arming of merchant ships, and naval escorts outside the patrol area, cannot be carried out due to the provisions of the act. From this, it can be seen that the modification or abolition of the Neutrality Act is inevitable and cannot be delayed today.</p>
<p>Although there are loud calls for the United States to participate in the war, unless there are more significant changes in the international situation, such a move is still premature. Moreover, although the isolationists have seen their influence wane, they have not disappeared. Perhaps the American authorities will temporarily propose an amendment to the Neutrality Act so that the task of assisting Britain and the Soviet Union and combating Germany and Italy can be carried out fully and effectively. When the appropriation of 40 billion in new military expenditures is submitted to Congress, this move will naturally be necessary. As for the Far East, it has not suffered significant damage in practice due to the existence of the Neutrality Act in the past, and its modification or cancellation should not have much impact. However, if the Neutrality Act can be fundamentally abolished, it would truly indicate that the United States has the full determination to fight at all costs and can no longer be intimidated by any war-monger. This would have some significant and subtle effects on clarifying the dangerous situation in the Far East and even the world.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 25th - Well-informed sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt's message to Congress next week will not be limited to requesting the repeal of the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - It was reported here yesterday that President Roosevelt will request a revision of the Neutrality Act next week, which is practically equivalent to repeal. It is reported that officials in the government are strongly urging the President to propose deleting the provisions of the Neutrality Act that prohibit American ships from sailing into belligerent ports or combat zones. Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that, with the exception of provisions that are suitable for needs, such as government control of arms exports, the remainder must be deleted. As for the idea that American ships do not sail into combat zones, so they can avoid attack, it is now clearly illusory. The attacks on the merchant ship Robin Moor and the destroyer Greer are proof of this. If the Nazis can attack American ships anywhere, then the United States has no reason to continue to abide by the combat zone restrictions. According to national law, American ships have the right to sail at will on the high seas. Arming American merchant ships is a necessary measure. Nazi submarines, airplanes, and raiders can attack American ships on the high seas where American ships have the right to sail, so American ships should naturally have the right to carry firearms for self-defense. I will initiate an amendment to allow the arming of merchant ships, and I think people in Congress will support it. Speaker of the House Rayburn also predicted that the House of Representatives would pass the merchant ship arming plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, said yesterday that there is no reason to believe that the President does not intend to announce his decision on the arming of merchant ships and the amendment of the Neutrality Act next week. The White House has not received any indications that opponents will obstruct the amendment of the Neutrality Act in Congress.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th - The Navy Department and Congress here said yesterday that the Navy has sufficient cannons to arm American merchant ships not registered in Panama, and has sufficient manpower and resources to arm the entire American merchant fleet. The House Appropriations Committee yesterday released an official request from the Navy, with the Navy Department requesting $75,888,820 to arm ships during the dangerous period when they enter dangerous areas. It is also learned that before the 5-inch guns are delivered, the ships can be equipped with 3-inch to 4-inch cannons.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 24th - New York City Mayor and Chairman of the American People's Air Raid Prevention Committee La Guardia yesterday asked Congress to authorize the committee with as much manpower and resources as possible to deal with any bombing attacks. The mayor told Texas Democratic Congressman and Speaker of the House Rayburn that it was necessary to take this step. He also said that most areas in the United States are at risk of air raids, and it is necessary to take precautions. However, many cities are unable to make self-defense arrangements, such as purchasing gas masks, fire-fighting equipment, medical supplies, and other matters, which should be funded and facilitated by the state.</p>

<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 15th - After inspecting Burmese defenses, British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, who had returned to Rangoon, told reporters today that the current temporary tranquility in the Far East is not a time for complacency. We must know that this tranquility is actually a fluke. We should make as much use of it as possible to obtain real value from this time. Brooke-Popham praised the new airfields he had visited and the roads he had passed. However, he stressed that defensive works and training still need to be greatly improved in order to guarantee the peace and security of Burma. Brooke-Popham solemnly stated that any situation occurring outside of Burma in this war will have a direct impact on Burma. For example, China's situation will directly affect the situation in this region. Therefore, Burma should provide all possible assistance to China. Brooke-Popham concluded by saying that the more prepared Burma is, the fewer chances there will be for Burma to be attacked.</p>

<p>United Press, New York, 25th - The New York Herald Tribune yesterday quoted reliable sources as saying that the U.S.-Japan talks have reached a critical stage, and President Roosevelt is now doing his best to prevent the talks from collapsing. The newspaper reported that the biggest obstacle to the talks is Japan's unwillingness to give a definite guarantee not to attack Siberia.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Fascist leader Nakano said today that the Japanese people need a stronger foreign policy. He does not believe that Britain and the United States will fight for the Dutch East Indies, but if Britain and the United States do fight Japan, Japan may be fully prepared. Nakano also said that unless Japan surrenders, Prime Minister Konoe will not be able to reach an agreement with the United States. If Japan yields to U.S. demands, Japan will be defeated. The Japanese people will never tolerate this.</p>

<p>International News Service, London, 25th - The Daily Express today carried a report from the Agukerss No Money Radio Station stating that twenty Soviet warships have arrived in Vladivostok from the Arctic Ocean, strengthening the strength of the Soviet Far Eastern Fleet.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th - Deputy Spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau Anzai broadcast to the nation last night, explaining the Japanese people's impressions of American aid to the Soviet Union. He said that the US ability to aid the Soviet Union from Vladivostok is limited. He also said that, setting aside the amount of aid to the Soviet Union, American ships carrying aircraft, gasoline, and other goods are being transported to the Soviet Union in areas adjacent to Japanese territorial waters, while at the same time intensifying the embargo against Japan. The general Japanese public views this as being the same as when British warships forcibly inspected Japanese ships near Mount Fuji last year. The entire Japanese population was extremely shocked by this incident, so the Japanese government had no choice but to send notes to the US and Soviet governments.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 25th - Since the German army won on the Eastern Front, various Chinese circles here believe that this matter will bring Japanese-Soviet warfare closer. Therefore, they are now closely monitoring the development of Japanese-Soviet relations. According to reliable intelligence received by military authorities here, the number of Japanese troops concentrated in areas along the Soviet border is approximately 580,000 to 800,000, while the Soviet side has 600,000 troops. The Japanese army will not launch an attack on the Soviet Union until Leningrad has fallen or Moscow is under real threat.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Key to the Pacific Situation Controlled by the United States U.S. and Britain Constantly Station Fleets and Armies The Far East Should Not Experience Incidents <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 25th - Former New York Times Shanghai correspondent Abend, who is currently touring the Dutch East Indies, told reporters here today that he does not trust the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. If the United States places its fleet in the Pacific and Britain continues to station its army in Malaya, and if this remains unchanged, then no incidents will occur. However, if the United States moves its fleet to the Atlantic and Britain withdraws its troops from Malaya, Japan will immediately take the opportunity to steal a march. He predicts that Japan will first attack the Soviet Union and then continue to advance south. Abend is currently reporting to American readers while touring the Philippines and Australia. At the same time, representative of the American National Broadcasting Company, the famous commentator Yang, who recently visited Japan, is also planning to stay here for three weeks. According to his observations, the U.S.-Japan discussions in Washington will continue after Japanese Deputy Ambassador to the U.S. Wakasugi returns to the U.S. from Tokyo. He believes that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura are both capable of fulfilling their duties. Yang also said that the key to the entire situation in the Pacific is in the hands of the United States, and it only needs to be expressed and utilized by the United States.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 25th - British High Commissioner to Australia, Close, said in Melbourne yesterday that British-Japanese relations are "poor" and that Japan should be held responsible for this.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Situation in Thailand Has Become More Moderate Border Defenses are Being Strengthened <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 25th - Important Thai officials said yesterday that they believe the situation in Thailand has recently eased slightly. The reasons for this are: (1) the strengthening of Singapore's defenses and the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies; (2) President Roosevelt's announcement that he will extend the sea lanes through which lend-lease items are sent to include the Pacific Ocean; (3) the rumored concentration of Japanese troops in Manchuria. Although Thailand lacks modern weapons such as airplanes, tanks, cannons, and machine guns, it is still constantly strengthening its eastern and northeastern borders. Many Thai reservists have been called into service, and the current troops have also exceeded their proper period of service and have not been relieved. United Press has learned that obstacles such as landmines, tank traps, outposts, and artillery fortifications in mountain passes are being built on the border. It is believed that Thailand currently has 200 aircraft, and small air-raid shelters to protect against bomb fragments have been built in Bangkok and other centers. However, the main method of air defense is to disperse the population into fields and thickets. Recent news said that Japan has 35,000 to 40,000 troops stationed in Vietnam. Naval officials believe that the acquisition of Saigon is helpful to Japan, but it is not enough to be a first-class base. If they want to make it a first-class base, it will take 18 months to several years of construction. If Japan attempts to occupy Thailand, it will get very little except land and rice. But if it conquers the southern part of old Siam, it can obtain iron ore, especially tin. If you fly from Singapore to Bangkok, you can clearly see that Thailand grows almost nothing but rice. Millions of acres of good land are planted with rice. Rice accounts for four-fifths of Thailand's exports. From the air, Malaya has many rubber, tin, and sugar cane plants in addition to rice. Flying from Singapore to Bangkok via Penang takes seven hours and passes the world's largest tin mine near Penang, which produces two-fifths of the world's output. Thais are similar in constitution and ethnicity to Filipinos. They are self-respecting and happy people with no close ties to Japan.</p>

<p>Reuters, Batavia, 25th</p>
<p>A Dutchman who arrived here from Saigon told reporters today that Vietnam has now almost become a province of Japan, and the French have practically no power. After the newly appointed Ambassador Sawada arrives in Vietnam, he will take over the Vietnamese administration. Although Decoux is still the Governor-General, he is only so in name. Vietnam was completely unable to resist the Japanese military occupation, so Vietnam can now be regarded as no longer belonging to France.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Economic Controls Implemented in Vietnam <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Saigon, 24th - Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux broadcast today, explaining the political and economic situation in Vietnam. He said that Vietnam has already encountered various difficulties in its economy and has no choice but to implement a controlled economy to overcome them. The government has initiated the organization of rubber companies to manage rubber exports, which is one measure. Recently, Vietnam also reached an agreement with Japan, which stipulates regulations for trade in rice and its by-products, which is the second measure. In addition, the Vietnamese government has also sought to maintain trade ties between its affiliated territories and France, as this trade is indispensable to Vietnam. In terms of agriculture, we have also made considerable progress. Large-scale water conservancy projects have been completed, and irrigation is convenient, which has greatly benefited agricultural affairs. Improvements in rubber cultivation have also achieved good results. The government has also recruited experts to establish a rubber research institute to strive for continuous improvement. In short, economic instability will inevitably lead to various difficulties. It is hoped that the Vietnamese people will be able to openly and honestly cooperate with the government, because only cooperation between the upper and lower levels can enable Vietnam to overcome difficulties in the midst of world panic.</p>

<h3 id="e36">In the Leningrad Sector Soviet and German Forces Stage Contest British Planes Participate in the Defense of Leningrad Central Red Army Crosses the Dvina River <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 25th - On the 24th, our army fought with the enemy along the entire front. At a certain point along the entire front, Soviet and German tanks engaged in fierce fighting. The tank team led by Voshnikov defeated a German tank team, destroying 20 enemy tanks and capturing 16 enemy tanks. 117 enemy tank crew members were captured.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 25th - The Leningrad battle, which has been raging for 30 days, flared up again yesterday. This may be the result of the reported Soviet counteroffensive being launched along the entire front. It is quite unclear what the Leningrad battle situation is, but military officials here are quite skeptical of German claims that they have broken through Soviet defenses and reached the outskirts of the city, as the Germans made similar reports a week ago. However, the statement by Leningrad wireless that "enemy forces have reached the gates of the city" seems to confirm the German claims. It is reported that Marshal Voroshilov is still fiercely resisting the German attempts to capture Leningrad and has launched several counteroffensives, and it is reported that three villages have been recaptured in the counteroffensive. Even though the fighting is fierce, Leningrad's defenders have not been broken through or retreated by the Germans, and military officials believe that the battle of Leningrad will not remain deadlocked, as the Germans have already formed a small wedge in the Soviet line that can be used for a final breakthrough. Some reports say that the German military is already anticipating that Leningrad will be occupied within the next two days or no later than next Thursday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 25th - The French official news agency quoted a Stockholm report as saying that British planes are now participating in the defense of Leningrad. With the help of British planes, the Soviet Air Force has inflicted heavy losses on the Germans. The Soviet fleet is also assisting Leningrad's defenders. The actions of German forces on this front are greatly hampered by the rain, and the nights are extremely cold. Soviet forces on the islands of Oesel and Dago, formerly part of Estonia, are still fiercely resisting attacks by Nazi aircraft, paratroopers, and infantry. In the far north, German forces launched a new offensive against Murmansk, which has been repulsed by Soviet forces. Soviet aircraft and warships have sunk several German troop transports and supply ships en route to Norway. In the south, Soviet General Butni has withdrawn part of his troops to new positions on the Donets River.</p>
<p>TASS, 25th, battlefield report - A few days ago, the Central Red Army achieved brilliant results on the banks of the Dvina River. First, the German army forcibly crossed the river and reached the east bank of the river, attempting to continue the offensive, but was blocked by the heroic resistance of the Red Army. The German army then quickly consolidated its positions, attempting to hold firm. The Red Army launched a counteroffensive on the same day. Under the cover of artillery and tanks, the Red Army shattered the stubborn resistance of the Nazi army, capturing key points in succession and forcing the enemy to retreat to the west bank of the Dvina River. The Red Army also captured the military road of Tongda D Village. In this battle, the entire German 102nd Division was defeated, with deaths reaching two regiments.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - According to officials here, it is now believed that the German army is currently developing an offensive against Crimea with four divisions or 70,000 troops. The isthmus has an extremely narrow neck, and the German army is attempting to pass through it in one fell swoop. The German army may also launch another offensive further east on the isthmus, as there is a very small space there that is easy to build pontoon bridges. This German offensive is based on the east bank of the Dnieper River.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Setback for German-Finnish Offensive on the Murmansk Front <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – Yesterday, Berlin and Moscow both broadcast about the terrible struggle in the Leningrad area, describing the back-and-forth between the two armies. The German side claimed to have occupied a "considerably large" city, saying that the German forces encountered staunch resistance from the defending troops before occupying the city, resulting in fierce street battles. The German side also claimed to have seized another section of Leningrad's defenses, stating that the German forces had occupied strong positions and destroyed several fortresses, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet army. However, the Soviet Red Star reported that there was fighting on the bridges leading to Leningrad, and the German offensive had been repelled. The Soviet army also launched a series of counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The Red Star's first-line dispatch stated that on Tuesday, the Soviet army counterattacked and engaged the enemy in fierce fighting throughout the day. The Soviet army forced the German 126th Infantry Division to retreat and captured strongly defended positions. Although the German side used tanks to assist infantry operations, they were still forced to retreat, leaving many German soldiers dead on the battlefield. In the first sector southeast of Leningrad, the German forces launched a wedge-shaped offensive, penetrating the Soviet defenses, but were driven back by Soviet "Cossack tanks." The term "Cossack tanks" is new. The Red Star also stated that when Soviet-Finnish troops attacked on the Murmansk front, the German 136th and 137th Alpine Regiments suffered significant casualties. From August 8th to 15th, 2,000 German soldiers were killed in action, and repeated attacks were repelled.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – According to German military headquarters, the annihilation battle east of Kyiv has entered its final stage, and enemy attempts to break through have been repelled. Leningrad is being increasingly surrounded. According to official Moscow sources, in addition to the Soviet army and the Baltic Fleet, the entire population is participating in the defense of Leningrad. The city is now completely isolated from the interior, and the Soviet fleet in Kronstadt has also suffered heavy damage. The city currently has a military and civilian population of 4.5 million.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 25th – A certain German authoritative military spokesperson stated yesterday that after the German forces broke through the Soviet defense lines and intensified the encirclement of Leningrad, they "have reached the outskirts of Leningrad." The spokesperson reiterated what German newspapers claimed last week: that the citizens of Leningrad are facing the fate of Warsaw due to their determination to defend the city. The German official news agency recently stated that German forces have occupied a certain town on the road to Leningrad, and other German troops are said to have occupied positions outside the city of Leningrad.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Bloody Tank Battle Between Soviet and German Forces in the Ukrainian Orchard Region <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – Activity has increased again on the Odessa front. Near Kherson, the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting, vying for the Soviet-held "N" point. According to dispatches from Moscow, the German side has deployed more reserve troops, but after a bloody battle, they have been repelled by the Soviet army. In this battle, German soldiers were piled up like mountains in tank traps, totaling approximately 1,500 bodies. The Soviet army holds firmly defended positions at "N" point. The German army launched repeated attacks with all its might, once breaking through the first line of Soviet defense. The Soviet commander deployed reserve troops, forcing the German army to retreat. The news carried by the Red Star refutes the German claim that the German army has advanced to the Perekop Isthmus, isolating the Crimean Peninsula. The Red Star did not explicitly state the distance from Kherson where the battle took place. Kherson is located on the high right bank of the Dnieper River, 20 miles from the river mouth, and is one of the largest cities along the Dnieper River. The area can be called the orchard of Ukraine because it produces the best grapes and peaches.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Führer's Headquarters, 25th – Today's German military report stated that the Soviet troops trapped east of Kyiv are fighting desperately, suffering heavy casualties. The remains of Lieutenant General Kirponos, commander of the Southwestern Front of the Soviet army, have been found on the battlefield. The Soviet 5th and 21st Armies have been annihilated. German aircraft heavily bombed military facilities in Moscow last night, as well as the Tula armaments factory.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 25th – The Romanian 13th and 15th Divisions were recently sent to the Odessa front to reinforce and attack Odessa, but they were all repelled by our army. Our army captured two artillery pieces, 100 machine guns, and many other war materials.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd – On the Southern Front, the Red Army achieved a major victory in a certain battle. 1,500 German soldiers were killed, and 4,000 were wounded. Our army destroyed or captured 20 enemy artillery pieces, 70 machine guns, and many other war materials.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Achievements of the Soviet Air Force <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – Yesterday's Soviet broadcast mentioned the combat record of the Soviet naval air force. Its supplementary communiqué stated that the Soviet Baltic Fleet's air force shot down 13 German aircraft on Sunday and destroyed 10 German aircraft on the airfield. Soviet naval bombers also destroyed two German anti-aircraft artillery batteries, 11 anti-aircraft machine gun positions, 14 armored vehicles, and eight artillery pieces on the road to Leningrad. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet's air force also destroyed 11 enemy aircraft on the airfield. TASS, Central Front, 25th</p>
<p>The Red Army Air Force on the Central Front has been extremely active recently. The Red Army Air Force team led by Zhevzhishvili has destroyed 39 enemy aircraft in the past few days. On one occasion, the team attacked an airfield and found no aircraft. It was then discovered that the enemy aircraft were hidden in the adjacent woods, so they were bombed twice in succession, destroying 10 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Germany Claims to Have Destroyed a Large Number of Soviet Aircraft</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – According to responsible authorities here yesterday, 78 Soviet aircraft were lost on Tuesday, including 57 shot down in aerial combat and 14 destroyed on the ground. At the same time, a small squadron of German bombers bombed an important hydroelectric power plant, sluice gate, turbine factory, and transformer station north of Kandalaksha Bay in the White Sea. On the same night, German aircraft bombed factories and supply stations in Moscow, causing fires in several places.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – It was revealed here last night that elite German bomber squadrons heavily attacked enemy artillery positions, fortifications, and railway stations in southern Ukraine. Explosions and large fires occurred everywhere. Photos taken by German reconnaissance aircraft show a large number of heavy artillery and war materials destroyed by German aircraft.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th – The German High Command announced today that in the three months since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the number of Soviet prisoners has reached over 2,200,000. It is noted that in World War I, Germany captured only 1,000,000 prisoners after two years of fighting against Russia, thus the previous record has already been broken.</p>

<h3 id="e42">British Commander-in-Chief in India, Wavell, Flew to London to Discuss the Soviet Union and the Middle East Situation; Home Secretary Denies Preparing to Invade the Soviet Union <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, recently flew to London. After discussing matters with Prime Minister Churchill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Dill, and other military officials, he has now returned to India. It is heard that the purpose of Wavell's trip was to discuss various issues arising from the situation in the Soviet Union and the Middle East.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 25th – Wavell's secret meetings with Dill, other cabinet members, and high-ranking military authorities coincide with German fears that they will reach the Caucasus oil fields in a short period of time. They also believe that Bulgaria poses a danger of attacking Turkey.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – Speculation in British newspapers that Imperial troops may be transported through Iran to the Soviet Union has taken on a new significance. General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, came here in August. Wavell also met with him in Egypt on his return flight to India. Wavell is said to have been responsible for establishing effective liaison with the Soviet Union and ensuring that all traffic through Iran is unimpeded.</p>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 25th – Reliable sources here stated yesterday that Bulgaria has evacuated Turkish people from their villages in Elhovo. The village is located on the Turkish border, near a military airfield. The report stated that after the evacuation of the Turkish people, the village was filled with ammunition, fuel, and other supplies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th – The German official news agency, quoting Sofia, reported that the Bulgarian Home Secretary denied to foreign journalists the French rumor that Bulgaria would soon wage war against the Soviet Union, establish a protectorate on the Crimean Peninsula, control the Black Sea, and participate in the development of the Caucasus oil fields. It was claimed that Bulgaria has no aggressive intentions towards any country and has not been pressured by any party.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 25th – Bulgarian Home Secretary Gabrovski received foreign reporters and explained the domestic situation in Bulgaria. He stated that reports in British, American, and Soviet newspapers that Bulgaria is making large-scale preparations to attack the Soviet Union are completely untrue. Bulgaria has no aggressive ambitions towards the Soviet Union. Normal diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union have not been severed to this day. Another report indicating that Bulgaria has declared a state of emergency and is carrying out general mobilization is also an exaggeration. In order to prevent Soviet sabotage, Bulgaria has had to take some necessary precautionary measures and declare some wartime punishments, but it has not declared a state of emergency or carried out general mobilization. The internal situation in Bulgaria is extremely stable, and the people are extremely quiet. They have all decided to do their best to extinguish Bolshevism. He refused to disclose any details of the paratrooper incident, stating that an official announcement had already been issued regarding the matter, and an investigation is still in progress. It is inconvenient to elaborate at this time, but it is expected that details will be made public to all sectors soon.</p>
<p>TASS, New York, 25th – According to foreign military circles, Bulgaria has been actively preparing for war in the past ten days. Three new divisions of recruits have been mobilized in five days. Martial law has been declared in the Burgas and Varna districts. Foreign ships are not allowed to enter the two ports. All Greek and Yugoslav residents in Bulgaria have also been mobilized. At the same time, disturbances have occurred throughout Bulgaria. The government has closed 19 secondary schools suspected of communist propaganda. Two weeks ago, several houses were burned down near Plovdiv. Warehouses and large quantities of grain in two factories near Sofia were also burned down. The Bulgarian authorities, in view of the serious situation, have stationed a division in the country to maintain order. Due to frequent military transport, railway traffic has been suspended.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 25th – The history of a new world of freedom and peace wrote its first page yesterday at St. James's Palace in London. Representatives attending the Allied International Conference unanimously agreed to adopt the Atlantic Charter as the cornerstone of post-war policy. British Foreign Secretary Eden, as chairman, strongly advocated the need for all free countries to organize in a timely manner and use their resources for the transition from war to peace. He then put forward a motion, the full text of which is as follows: (1) The common purpose of the participants is to ensure that the necessary food supplies and goods are available to the countries liberated from Nazi oppression after the war. (2) The governments and authorities of the Allied countries have a responsibility to prepare for the economic needs of their own people. The plans they formulate should be adjusted in the spirit of joint cooperation among the Allied countries in order to achieve their common goals. (3) For the above-mentioned purposes, each of the Allied countries expresses its willingness to actively cooperate within its capabilities to prepare for the necessary actions. (4) Therefore, the governments and authorities of the Allied countries must each prepare a budget for their urgent needs, listing the types and quantities of food supplies and goods, and indicating the order of priority for the delivery of various supplies. The motion was unanimously passed by the assembly. When presenting this motion, Eden stated that the British government invited the governments and authorities of the Allied countries to hold this meeting in order to provide the necessary supplies to the occupied countries immediately after the withdrawal of German troops. The British government committee has already begun preliminary work on this, and the committee guided by the government's chief economic adviser, Lees-Smith, has also begun studying Europe's needs. Soviet Ambassador Maisky stated that all organizations and groups related to various governments should be composed of equal representatives from each country. Therefore, he suggested that all plans must first be submitted to various governments for consideration. Although he now supports the chairman's proposal, he reserves the right to propose some measures in accordance with this principle in the future. Eden replied that the organization and scope can be modified or expanded as needed. What we want is to carry out the work approved by this meeting. Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Luxembourg, etc. then spoke one after another, expressing their agreement.</p>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 25th – The High Command issued a battle report this morning stating that a British convoy was attacked by several of our submarines near the west coast of Africa. Eleven merchant ships in the convoy, totaling 78,000 tons, were all sunk by our submarines, despite being protected by several destroyers. Only one small ship escaped.</p>

<p>International News Service, Cairo, 25th – The Axis powers are preparing to attack the Middle East. So far, a war in the region may break out soon. Reporters investigating the positions of the British and Allied forces have seen that their strength has been strengthened, enough to cope with future offensives. While the German army is unable to look eastward due to its attack on the Soviet Union, the Allied forces have been able to establish strong positions in Iraq and Iran. At the same time, the remnants of the Italian army in Eritrea and Abyssinia have been cleared. Therefore, elite troops from India and South Africa have been transferred to the Middle East. The island of Cyprus has become the maritime bulwark of the Allied forces in the Middle East. A large amount of American supplies arriving in the Middle East are stored on the island. More and more American observers, trainers, and technicians are coming here to serve, so it is common to hear American accents. Free French forces are also concentrated in various defense areas. The strength of their defense will be evident when the Axis powers reach out.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music is established for children who are gifted and want to pursue further studies in music. Anyone with special musical talent, regardless of poverty, can enroll for free. Many people have registered. Because individual testing is time-consuming, the conservatory has changed its methods and holds tests in stages. The results of the first batch of children's tests show that nine children are very musically talented, with Zhu Changping and Shi Zhongguang being the most outstanding. Zhu is nine years old and will receive a full scholarship, and Shi is six years old and will receive a half scholarship. It is heard that the second batch of children's tests is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on the 28th of this month, still at the conservatory at No. 14 Yuyuan New Village.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Cocoa Cup Charity Softball Tournament; Four Chinese Teams Hold Playoffs; Three Western Teams Decide to Withdraw <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Cocoa Cup Charity Softball Tournament has already held three preliminary games. There are two remaining games: North West Children vs. Portugal, and Jewish vs. Swedish. The Western teams, North West Children, Jewish, and Portugal, must wait for the decision of the Westerners' Association due to the association's charter. The West Union Executive Committee was originally scheduled to hold a regular meeting yesterday, but it has been postponed to next Tuesday due to unforeseen circumstances. The Cocoa Cup organizers have decided to treat the above three foreign teams as having withdrawn from the competition. Currently, in addition to the Dragon Team and the Golden Lion CGO, which advanced after winning in the preliminary round, Swedish also advanced without effort after the Jewish team withdrew. Therefore, the four teams, including the Dragon Team, will hold the playoffs. It is scheduled for this afternoon at 4:00 p.m. to have Qian Weilie and Wang Ruilong preside over the draw to arrange the playoff order. The playoffs will begin this Sunday (the 28th).</p>

<p>Blue White Also Decides to Participate in the Grand Event</p>
<p>The Paramount Sports Association, in order to raise scholarships, is separately donating to the News Daily's Loan Scholarship Fund, the Shen Daily's Scholarship Fund, and the Orphanage's Higher Education Savings Fund, and is holding a charity basketball对抗competition, inviting the strong teams Blue White and Shanghai Black to compete against Paramount separately. The tournament is scheduled to open next Wednesday. It is learned that the Shanghai Star has already agreed to participate, while the Blue White's response has been delayed due to the departure of key players Chen Bangzhen and Li Zude from Shanghai. Now, due to the urging of the organizers, Blue White has agreed to participate, but has requested that Shanghai Star take the lead first. Blue White will be able to participate in two weeks, as Chen and Li will have returned to Shanghai by then. In addition, Wang Nanqun, who recently arrived in Shanghai, as well as Bao Songyuan, Zhang Jinxuan, Fan Qingxian, Qiu Xiaoci and other strong players, have further enhanced the team's strength, making the charity performance even more enthusiastic. Therefore, the organizers will slightly adjust the schedule. In addition to the first game between Shanghai Star and Paramount, which is scheduled to open next Wednesday (October 1st), the second game is scheduled for the following Monday (6th), and the third game will be held on Double Ten Day (Friday). The three games between Blue White and Paramount will begin on the 12th or 14th of next month, so that the player problems of Blue White can be solved easily. Tickets for each game are divided into two types: ordinary tickets at 3 yuan and honorary tickets at 10 yuan. Pre-sales will begin this Sunday (the day after tomorrow). The organizers have also sent a letter to accountant Xu Shuizuo to voluntarily audit the number of tickets, check the ticket revenue, and verify the distribution figures to demonstrate great credibility.</p>

<p>— Tan Lian</p>
<p>Tiexi Kang is most prosperous, with Mianning Rongjing and Hanyuan all being iron producing areas. They can produce four to five hundred tons of iron per month. The iron ore deposits in Huili County are particularly rich, and also contain copper and zinc. The other seven counties of the former Ning Prefecture all produce gold nuggets and gold sand. Gulang, Zhangye, Linze, Gaotai, Jiuquan and other counties in Gansu province produce 20,000 taels of gold annually. Coal is produced in Sichuan, Kang, and Guizhou provinces. As for petroleum, the oil wells outside Jiayuguan in Gansu can produce 60,000 gallons per month. With new machinery installed, this can be increased to 450,000 gallons. The tung oil production of Sichuan province in 1936 was only 150,000 piculs, which increased to 350,000 piculs in 1938. Currently, Sichuan accounts for 40% of the total national tung oil exports, with most of it being shipped to the United States. The Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute and the Foreign Trade Commission implemented a ten-year plan last year to increase tung oil production in Sichuan province from 400,000 piculs per year to 1 million piculs. The Foreign Trade Commission is also cooperating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to implement a five-year plan in Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces to increase tung oil production in each province to 650,000 piculs per year. The gasoline refined from crude oil is of extremely high quality. According to tests conducted by the Northwest Highway Bureau, it has one-third greater mileage than Soviet gasoline (Soviet oil runs 6 kilometers per gallon, while Gansu oil can run 9 kilometers per gallon). Alcohol production has also increased from 920,000 gallons to 580,000 gallons per day. Factories have surged since the war. According to recent surveys, the southwestern and northwestern provinces have a total of 361 chemical factories, 313 mechanical factories, 294 spinning mills, 93 metallurgical factories, 48 power plants, and 269 other factories. These are the agricultural, mineral, and industrial aspects that should be studied.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Yarn and Cotton: Overnight Rumors Prove False, Mill Order Buying Regains Momentum, Southern Seas Demand Still Improves: Blended Yarn Up 10-20 Yuan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had plummeted the day before yesterday afternoon, rebounded yesterday. This was because the rumored incident turned out to be unfounded. Hong Kong traders continued to procure yarn with strong buying interest, and the price of various brands of yarn rose uniformly, increasing by about 10-20 yuan compared to the previous day. As a result, weakened morale was revived, and the market gradually improved. 20s Double Horse was usually 1764 yuan, with a low price of 1746 yuan. The market became tighter after the afternoon opening due to improved demand in Southeast Asia. Several factories sold 600 bales of 20s Double Horse at prices ranging from 1755 yuan to 1770 yuan, boosting buyer morale. The market rose from 1766 yuan to 1771 yuan. After fluctuating at this price for some time, a sudden rumor spread in the market near the close, and selling orders appeared on the trading floor, causing a sharp drop to 1755 yuan. However, buyers flocked in at the low price, and it rebounded to close at 1765 yuan. Today, 1505 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning due to the rebound after the close of the previous day, and a portion of the market absorbed short positions, opening 10 yuan higher at 1795 yuan. However, there were still plenty of sellers, who were battered the previous day. It soon loosened to 1748 yuan. News then spread that Guangdong traders were continuously seeking spot yarn in the market, and prices gradually rose, restoring confidence and pushing the market back up to close at 1764 yuan. According to statistics, 10,445 bales were traded in the morning. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed below:</p>

<p>The recent turbulent spot cotton yarn market, with its ups and downs, has frightened people. In reality, both bulls and bears have different opinions. Sellers believe that the international situation is still unpredictable, considering the yarn price floor already high, and tend to sell. As for the buyers, one reason is that the price of various brands of yarn is gradually increasing and Hong Kong traders have strong demand. The second reason is that cotton prices are high. While applications for purchasing foreign cotton are still pending, the price of 20s raw cotton must be sold at 450-480 yuan per dan. As a result, cost is a factor, and factories are unwilling to sell. Therefore, buying factory orders in the market is a good plan. It is imaginable how fierce the competition between bulls and bears will be, and it is unknown who will win.</p>
<p>Golden Double Horse Futures Market Situation: The situation turned stable, with extremely narrow fluctuations, with a difference of only 6-7 yuan throughout the day. Although ocean cotton rose again and factory orders were over 10 yuan higher at the opening in the morning, recent contracts had not suffered any impact due to the previous day's early close, so buyers were still willing to accept. However, there was no strength to pull it up again, so it opened at 1662 yuan, down 6 yuan. November contracts opened at 678 yuan, also down 5 yuan. However, long-term contracts were absorbed at low prices, opening at 1714 yuan, up 4 yuan. Afterwards, factory orders did indeed rise again, but failed to excite futures yarn sentiment. The volatile factory orders made speculators like frightened birds, and they dared not follow, resulting in sluggish trading and sideways movement. In the afternoon, because spot prices and the exchange still advanced, sentiment was more active, with some short-covering and long liquidation. The market was slightly firmer, with October rising to 1669 yuan, November rising to 682 yuan, and December rising to 1717 yuan. However, general sellers suddenly came out to sell at high prices, resulting in a setback of two to three yuan. As a result, near-month contracts closed at 1666.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan, November contracts at 1679 yuan, also down 4 yuan, and December contracts at 1714 yuan, up 4 yuan alone. The price movements are listed in the table below.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Yarn Market Tight, Cotton Prices Even Higher <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains tight. General opinion is that inventory is becoming increasingly thin, making varieties such as India-flower, and Omra, more rare and expensive, because the problem of future orders cannot be solved effectively. Therefore, the yarn market is tight and the cotton prices are firm. Conversely, cotton prices are not moving.</p>

<p>New York cotton market rose first due to buying in New Orleans futures and poor weather reports, causing strong short covering, and then fell slightly due to some profit taking. Yesterday's closing prices were about 12-13 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell due to a large amount of long liquidation and cotton merchant hedging. As a result, closing prices fell by 5-10 rupees each. It is also predicted that today's opening market price will rise by half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading market situation is very strong due to the firm rise in cotton yarn, and various parties are buying very heavily. The spot cotton trading is quite prosperous.</p>
<p>It is predicted that since direct orders cannot be developed temporarily, various parties can only focus on sourcing spot cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Food: How Can Rice Prices Stay High? <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Imported rice has risen for several days in a row, but suddenly saw a decline yesterday. This is because the stock is considered sufficient, and the source will be cut off. As rice prices have repeatedly increased, people are inevitably wary. It is said that 58-59,000 bags of government-controlled rice will arrive soon, and the rice will still be allocated to rice shops for public sale as usual. It is said that the selling price will only be 125 yuan, in order to reduce the retail price to below 110 yuan. The market was shocked when this news was released, especially the speculators in the warehouses. The arbitrage business was also defeated, and the situation became soft, and the price gradually fell. At the lowest point, Yin Zhan Xiaojiao actually fell below the 110 yuan mark, opening at 109.5 yuan, while Wai Zhan opened at 109 yuan. Afterwards, there was slight recovery due to bargain hunting, returning to the original point. The Yin Zhan closed at 110.05 yuan, and the Wai Zhan closed at 110 yuan, a drop of about 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Among other varieties, except for broken pointed rice, which was active due to the activities of the Hangzhou and Shaoxing traders, there was no change. It opened high at 85-86 yuan, then fell to 82-83 yuan. The rest of the situation was similar to that of Xiaojiao, with a drop of 1-2 yuan. The price of No. 1 Xigui high quality rice was 124-123.5 yuan, Dashibai was 122-121.5 yuan, Zhongguan was 110 yuan, No. 2 Gaobai was 113.5 yuan, followed by 108.5 yuan, No. 2 Gailuo Gao was 111-110 yuan, followed by 107.5 yuan, Mindang milled rice was 121-120 yuan, ordinary rice was 118.5 yuan, Zhongguan Yuanbai was 116-114.5 yuan, and Tokyo pointed tip special grade was 109 yuan, followed by 104 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin Japonica rice prices were also weak due to the influence of foreign rice. Nanhai Zaopo was discounted by 2 yuan, opening at 147-145 yuan. Pudong Xinjiang was not much different because there was not much stock in the market, only dropping by 1 yuan, opening at 152.5-151.5 yuan. As for thick and broken rice, no transactions were heard due to lack of stock.</p>
<p>Sparse appetite for glutinous rice continued to move, and the buying was very tight. Therefore, the sellers could not raise prices, and the result was flat without any changes. Hong Kong special grade opened at 135-136 yuan, Da Shi Bai opened at 133-134 yuan, Zhongguan opened at 131 yuan, and Nuoluo opened at 119 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice was transferred to Qingdao. The Taikoo Company's Poyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to the original large batch of imported rice and sugar being transported to Qingdao, Shanghai also loaded an additional 1,400 bags of imported rice to be transported to Qingdao. (Zu)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Imported Flour Finally Settled <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Imported flour initially stabilized and then returned to settle. The market saw slight fluctuations in the midst of stability. Because there are no new developments in the international situation, both bulls and bears are at a loss. If we consider the abundant inventory and uninterrupted sources, the market should follow the lead of imported rice and fall slightly. However, current retail demand is still active, and major holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. Since the deteriorating relations between the United States and Germany and Japan have not been resolved, the source of American flour is sometimes feared to be blocked, so holders of flour are even more reluctant to sell at a discount. And general speculators are always taking advantage of small opportunities to buy, so the result is that flour is relatively firm, and other varieties are also stable. Cannon brand went from 33.7 yuan to 33.85 yuan, and was suppressed by 0.1 yuan in the evening. Xiangwu was 33.34 yuan, Five Swallow was 23.35 yuan, Golden was 30 yuan, Flower Bird was 33.3 yuan, Jinlong West Warehouse was 31.5-31.78 yuan, and East Warehouse was 32.15-32.3 yuan, all slightly higher than the previous evening. About 20,000 bags were still traded. Bran is in short supply, and local bran was 33.67 yuan, also more popular than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Sold off Stockpiles <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Soybeans Scattered Sales Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market, raw soybean oil due to the influence of Lianyou's (a brand) upcoming arrival in Shanghai, stockpiles suddenly had a large sale, and the market was mixed, seeing alternating increases and decreases. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil futures, long positions, seeing the unfavorable environment, have begun to secretly liquidate positions, so the price fell by 3-4 yuan. The overall market sold 110 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 1,000 cans of Yanting raw oil, 1,730 cans of soybean oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 110 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, over 7,000 dan of Dayou factory's processed oil futures, over 2,000 barrels of Rihua factory's rapeseed oil futures, and 50 barrels of Taishan factory's rapeseed oil. (Prices detailed in the market price section.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the scattered sales of soybeans on this street were quite active. The sellers tried to raise prices, so the market trend was firm. It is estimated that 300 bags of Guide yellow soybeans, 200 bags of Jining yellow soybeans, 2 trucks of Changzhou Niu Pi Qing, and 1 truck of Niu Pi Huang were sold. Prices were about 0.5 yuan higher than before. Today, 500 bags of soybeans will be transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, both the Central Bank and HSBC quotes were flat. HSBC's small counter saw a large number of legitimate commercial settlements for import and export. It is rumored that the Exchange Stabilization Fund telegraphed Shanghai to approve US$400,000-500,000 for tobacco import settlements, at a price of 5.3125 yuan. In the black market for British and American exchange, many Chinese merchants continued to transact, selling to Chinese firms and foreign banks within the fourteen companies, at a price of 4.875 yuan. The activity of importers who are generally not allowed to apply is weakening, so the American exchange rate firmed to 4.75 yuan for purchase, up 0.0625 from the previous day. The British pound rate was 2.8125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened sluggishly this morning, with no changes in any exchange rate.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 15th (Thursday) Telegraph: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. London and New York telegraphic exchange rates were unchanged. Shanghai exchange rate rose 1 yuan, to 87 yuan. The black market rate for joint banknotes rose 0.79, to 47 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Gold Price Unable to Rise <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw small fluctuations for the October contract, with a difference of only 2 yuan. The price finally settled at a decrease of 2 yuan, with about 200-300 taels of transactions, at a price of about 6,891 yuan. The spot price rose first and then fell back, with an uncertain trend. It rose 35 yuan immediately under the buying momentum of the spot gold shops after breaking through the 9,100 yuan mark, when Shihe purchased 60 taels from Wanfeng and 10 taels from Deshun, for 9,110 yuan, and then Chengji purchased 50 taels, rising to 9,120 yuan. Xianghe also came to purchase, rising more vigorously, Shihe purchased 30 taels from Lianxing, for 9,130 yuan, and then Yili, Tianyuan, Wanfeng, Hesheng, Hongqingyong and others purchased 110 taels, rising to 9,150 yuan, Suifu sold 10 taels of Shihe, doing small business to 9,140 yuan, Xianghe purchased over 200 taels from Lianyu, Tianyuan, Chengda, Yongcheng, Chengji, Defu, and others, and then rose to 9,150 yuan.

The price of gold for the brand of Jinmen Jewelry Store was 9,100 yuan for selling and 100 yuan lower than selling for purchasing, and the price of ornamental gold also rose by 10 yuan first and then returned to flat, still 930 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Lifeless</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 6,892 yuan at 9:15, the same as the previous day's closing price.

<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds was unusually sluggish yesterday, with very small fluctuations. Types A and B were relatively weak, and trading still showed no sign of improving. Although numbers 31 and Tongkang continued to sell, there were very few buyers, but they were also unwilling to lower prices, so it became even more meandering. The Sichuan traders continued to sell constantly, and the longs only waited in ambush, so there were no major sellers, and the trend will probably be stagnant for a while. In the morning, numbers 31 and Tongkang sold, and Renchang and Yitai bought. Type C was highest at 1.5 yuan and lowest at 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, numbers 31 and Tongkang were still sellers, and Runli and Hengkang bought. Type C was highest at 1.45 yuan and lowest at 0.3 yuan. Types A and B showed signs of weakness. Market prices for types D and E were unchanged, and the rest were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. Transactions were around 800,000 yuan. The brief listing is listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tight sugar market did not weaken, and continued to move upwards, rising from a few cents to a few yuan. The association's current price of spot 24 coarse white sugar was 137.85 yuan for September arrivals, up 0.8 yuan, 136.873 yuan for August, up 0.5 yuan, 136.47 yuan for July, and 136.65 yuan for June, all up 0.7 yuan.

<p>The tinplate and galvanized iron that have been circulating in the market for a long time have recently seen soaring prices, coupled with a lack of spot goods, purchasers have the worry of having no goods to buy, therefore the off-brand narrow strip iron took the opportunity to rise, its price is much lower than the above-mentioned two genuine goods, therefore it is the purpose of purchase by can factories, toy factories and printing factories on this street, and there are many transactions in recent days, and the industry who holds this goods has seen high sentiment, and there are not many spot goods in the market, so the market is particularly firm. For example, all colors of 2-inch or larger iron were sold at 650 yuan per hundred pounds, while larger sizes were temporarily impossible to find, which also shows one aspect of its circulation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Serious Economic Discussion <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Liuying</p>
<p>Hoarding (1)</p>
<p>Since the war, prices have repeatedly increased, and there is still no end in sight. Of course, it is also affected by controlled sources, poor cargo transportation, imbalanced supply and demand, exorbitant taxes and levies, and increasingly high commodity costs, as well as the gradual reduction of the black exchange rate. However, the increasingly rampant hoarding has led prices to break free from the monetary shackles and rise indefinitely. It is also the most important factor.</p>
<p>Hoarding is a natural function of commerce and an exploitative means for the rich to deceive the poor, which is not surprising. However, it is condemned by the world precisely because of its insatiable greed, desperately absorbing goods and constantly raising prices, making it difficult for the masses to breathe and survive, even abandoning wives and children, killing infants and cooking them in order to survive, and other outrageous and immoral acts. These inhumane events are caused by the selfish intentions of a few powerful people. However, with a finite life, pursuing infinite desires, only enjoying temporary pleasure, and secretly committing endless sins, reflecting on oneself in the quiet night, one knows why one must work so hard for profit.</p>
<p>People mostly hoard, but do not investigate the origin of hoarding. I have never hoarded, but now I want to talk about hoarding. Wouldn't that make people think I am fond of scratching an itch from outside my boot? Although I am incompetent, I might as well talk about it.</p>
<p>Hoarding is commonly written as 囤积 (tún jī), but I think 屯积 (tún jī) is correct. The 囤 (dùn) is what is needed, a woven bamboo container formed into a strip, circled and closed, used to store rice. There are also straw containers woven with rice straw that are three or four feet in diameter and about one foot high, piled up to store rice. Whether made of bamboo or straw, they are all called rice containers. 囤 is a noun, similar to 囷 (qūn). Looking at its shape, one can also know its meaning. Inside a circle, rice is stored. Is it not a container for storing rice? The character 囷 is ancient, and the character 囤 is later. 囤 is composed of 囗 (wéi, enclosure) and 屯 (tún), derived from the character 屯, because it is a container for hoarding, so a circle is added outside of 屯 to show that it is a container; also, because its function is to 屯, its meaning still comes from 屯.</p>
<p>屯积 is a type of action. If 囤 is used, it does not move. 屯 means to gather; 积 means to store; to gather goods and store them is the original meaning of 屯积. The original pronunciation of 屯 is tún, but it is commonly pronounced in the rising tone like 豚 (tún). It can also be pronounced as dùn, so in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, 屯 is often pronounced as dùn and called 顿货 (dùn huò, hoarded goods).</p>

<h3 id="e69">Shanghai Goods Transport to Free Areas Prohibited: Economic Warfare Begins; Overseas Ports Can Still Transport Internally; Increased Re-export Tax Has No Impact on Trade <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 33 yesterday regarding the prohibition of goods destined for free areas, stating: "From September 25, 1941, all goods are prohibited from being transported from Shanghai to any ports and cities in non-occupied areas. However, goods required for ship navigation are not subject to this prohibition. Please take note and comply accordingly." This announcement was issued under the authority of the Japanese Tax Commissioner of the General Affairs Department of the Customs.</p>
<p>Overseas Ports Still Free</p>
<p>The customs announcement did not specify which areas were considered "non-occupied areas." However, sources claim that the purpose of this measure is to completely prohibit the transportation of any goods to the free areas of China. Hong Kong, Rangoon, Manila, and overseas ports are still free to export, but this should not conflict with the Japanese embargo measures taken in retaliation for the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the United States and Britain. In other words, except for the dozen or so types of goods specified by the Japanese, exports to foreign countries are not within the scope of the prohibition. Although the transport of goods to Hong Kong is not prohibited, a double re-export tax will be imposed to show restriction. However, future developments are still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Internal Transport of Goods Not Expected to Be Interrupted</p>
<p>Since the port of Hong Kong is not subject to the embargo, goods can still be re-exported to the free areas via Hong Kong. In this regard, there is no significant impact on trade with the free areas, only an increase in the re-export tax. On the other hand, the internal transport of goods from Shanghai via the seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian will likely be cut off. Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang, and Shanghai and Fujian has been interrupted. In reality, goods can still find ways to be transported into the free areas through these two routes. Therefore, this prohibition of goods being transported to non-occupied areas probably refers to goods transferred to the inland areas via Zhejiang and Fujian. The impact will be limited to exports to Zhejiang and Fujian. However, exports from Shanghai to [blank space in original] will inevitably increase in the future. Therefore, the prohibition of goods going to free areas will ultimately be in vain, and trade between Shanghai and the mainland will not suffer adverse effects.</p>
<p>Retaliation Against the Stabilization Fund</p>
<p>According to informed business sources, the Japanese-instructed announcement of the embargo on goods destined for the mainland is actually a retaliatory measure against the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. The Stabilization Fund prohibits Chinese funds from flowing from Hong Kong into occupied areas and Shanghai. The Stabilization Fund Committee, in order to maintain trade with allied nations in Shanghai, decided to provide foreign exchange at a rate of 5.34375 US dollars and 3.1875 British pounds. This move is the essence of the asset freeze and is undoubtedly a severe blow to Japanese commerce. At the same time, it is also making every effort to prevent Chinese funds from flowing into occupied areas, including Shanghai. Therefore, the Japanese have banned the transport of goods to free areas as retaliation. This is evidence that China, the United States, and Britain have launched a fierce economic war against Japan.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Remain Strong</p>
<p>The embargo will have a significant impact on Chinese, British, and American cotton spinning mills, as the transport of cotton cloth and cotton yarn to the mainland will encounter difficulties. However, Japanese cotton mills will not be affected at all because Japanese goods have long been prohibited from being transported to non-occupied areas. Therefore, at the beginning of the embargo announcement, the market price of cotton yarn plummeted. This was actually caused by speculators taking advantage of the situation. However, from yesterday onwards, the ban on the export of green cotton yarn to non-occupied areas has had no impact on actual sales (the Hong Kong route is open), and sporadic purchases by Hong Kong businesses have not stopped. Therefore, the spot yarn market price rose again yesterday.</p>

<p>The British Residents Association, at its annual meeting decided on Tuesday, will convene a general meeting on November 7, to be held at the Race Course on Jing'an Temple Road. All British residents are expected to attend before 5:30 PM that afternoon. According to association sources, the general meeting will discuss many issues, with particular emphasis on the increase in the price of coal and the "scalping" of tickets by conductors on all trams, buses, and trolleybuses in the Public Concession. After discussion, recommendations will be submitted to the relevant authorities for appropriate measures to eradicate and prevent these issues. The increase in rent will also be a central issue for discussion at the meeting.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a Japanese army information officer here admitted today (the 25th) that Chinese bombers flew to Yueyang, the headquarters of the Japanese army in the Northern Hunan campaign, on Tuesday and dropped bombs. It is reported that the Chinese bombers flew extremely high over Yueyang, making them almost invisible from the ground. Two aircraft dropped two large bombs.</p>

<p>The Public Concession police have been conducting searches within the Concession since Monday of this week, and the situation became even more tense yesterday. Inspection teams were densely deployed in the central district of Guan City. All passers-by, regardless of who they are, must undergo strict searches. It is reported that detectives are also stationed along Nanjing Road, and all Chinese merchant hotels have been subjected to strict searches. It is said that a number of suspects have been arrested so far. This measure is expected to continue to be implemented in the short term.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Council's Roads Committee held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd regarding the issue of levying a special property tax on business premises, and passed it in principle. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Committee held its second meeting in the Council Chamber to continue discussing the matter and submitted the Council's proposed collection method and tax rate for review. The first proposal classified business premises such as exchanges as Category A, and other general business premises as Category B, with tax collection handled according to category. The second proposal was to levy a uniform tax regardless of category. After discussing the two proposals, it was considered that distinguishing between categories in the first proposal would inevitably lead to considerable difficulties in procedure, and that the first proposal, which did not distinguish between categories and levied a uniform tax on various business premises, was more convenient. Therefore, it was decided to cancel the distinction between Categories A and B, and to implement the second proposal in practice. As for the tax rate, it was also decided to levy a special property tax of 8% on the assessed value of the premises, and it was decided that this new tax would be implemented from January next year. It is heard that during the discussion, a comparison was made between the income from classified taxation and uniform taxation. The result was that uniform taxation would only reduce revenue by approximately 13,000 yuan per year compared to classified taxation. Therefore, the above decision was made.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Foreign Exchange Suspension for Film Rental Fees Anxieties in First-Run Cinemas Propose to Temporarily Deposit Rental Fees in Designated Banks Rumors of Sending Representatives to Hong Kong to Request Foreign Exchange <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Most of the films shown in Shanghai's major cinemas come from Europe and the United States, with American films being the main source. German films have completely disappeared since the European War. Recently, in order to prevent opportunism and disrupt the financial market, the central government, after cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange, strictly enforced measures to prohibit the settlement of foreign exchange. Foreign film merchants will no longer be able to remit rental fees out of China after the films are shipped to China.</p>
<p>Annual Rental Fees Approximately 7 Million</p>
<p>It is estimated that American films publicly screened in Shanghai each year have a rental fee of approximately US$350,000 (equivalent to over 7 million legal currency). Recently, more than ten first-run cinemas in the city that exclusively screen Western films have relied on American films to survive. If American film companies actually implement a ban on films being shipped to Shanghai, these cinemas will be forced to close. According to a reporter from Dagong News Agency, after the Stabilization Fund planned the above rules, the Shanghai representatives of American film merchants informed the cinemas that if the suspension of foreign exchange supply is implemented, it will be difficult for new films to be shipped to China.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong Cinemas Jointly Send Telegrams to Request</p>
<p>Therefore, cinemas in Shanghai and Hong Kong that exclusively screen Western films jointly sent telegrams to American companies, requesting the continued supply of new films. Regarding rental fees, if they cannot be remitted to the United States, the rental fees will be deposited in designated banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong at the prevailing exchange rate. Once the restrictions are lifted, the remittance will be made accordingly. Whether American film companies will agree to this approach is still unknown, as no reply has been received in Shanghai. If rejected, in order to maintain their business and the livelihoods of their employees, cinemas that exclusively screen Western films will temporarily transition to domestic films. Therefore, various Chinese film companies in the city are currently planning to improve production in order to take advantage of this opportunity, revitalize domestic films, and indirectly recover huge lost profits.</p>
<p>Cinema Owners Meet to Discuss Increasing Ticket Prices</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that reliable sources say that cinema ticket prices in the city are expected to increase by about 25% starting from the beginning of October. It is expected that cinema owners will meet in the next day or two to make a final decision on the price increase. The new films currently available in Shanghai are sufficient for screenings for the next few months. At the same time, the Shanghai Film Merchants Association and the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund are currently in discussions. The Film Merchants Association may send a representative to Hong Kong to resolve the issue of foreign exchange settlement for film rental fees.</p>

<p>The British ship "Gold Prince" was loaded with a large batch of piece goods, yarn, and sundry goods in Shanghai, intending to transport them to Wenzhou. The secret was discovered, and the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie intercepted the ship before it set sail. For the past twenty days, it has been under surveillance at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. It is reported that as a result of the Japanese search of the ship, in addition to passengers admitting to going to Wenzhou, many permits to sail to Wenzhou were also found. Recently, many pieces of grass-green cotton cloth were found in the loaded piece goods, which aroused further suspicion from the Japanese. It is now learned that all the cargo on the ship has been confiscated. Yesterday, the Japanese sent barges to unload the cargo from the ship and transported it to the Japanese naval warehouse for storage, effectively confiscating it. Although the cargo has been confiscated, there is still no hope for the ship's release.</p>

<p>Public utilities in the French Concession of this city, including electricity (lighting, heating), tap water, and public trams, trolleybuses, and buses, had previously been requested by the French Water and Electricity Company to increase fees with approval from the French Municipal Council in July of this year, which went into effect on July 31. Now, after just two months, the company has notified all utility users and public transportation passengers in the Concession that new prices will be implemented from October 1 of this year. From now on, citizens in the Concession will have an even heavier burden. The small electricity price increase is estimated at 6 cents per kilowatt-hour for lighting, 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for power under 10 horsepower, 3.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for power over 10 horsepower, 7 cents per kilowatt-hour for electric heating, and 14 cents per cubic meter for tap water. The revised price list for trams, trolleybuses, and buses will be displayed in each vehicle at that time. It is rumored that the increase will be about 20%.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Ruogu, editor of the Sino-American Daily, was suddenly arrested by Japanese personnel and French police officers at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin in the French Concession at 1 PM the day before yesterday when he got off a No. 21 public bus. He was taken to the Central Police Station on Avenue Edward VII for questioning. It is reported that several Japanese military police were present during the questioning. Later, at 5 PM, he was handed over to the Japanese authorities by the police station and taken to Hongkou. After Mr. Zhang was detained at the police station, the newspaper heard the news and tried to rescue him in various ways. It is known that Mr. Zhang studied in Belgium, obtained a degree, and returned to China. He has held positions in the press for many years. Later, when the Sino-American Daily was founded, he responded to the invitation and joined the newspaper to edit the supplement "Jina." Mr. Zhang is skilled in art, loyal to his duties, and a devout Catholic. In addition to devoting himself to journalism, he has no other activities. However, he has been repeatedly threatened in recent years. In order to prevent accidents, Mr. Zhang moved into the newspaper office, acted cautiously, and obtained a self-prepared pistol from the Public Concession police for self-defense. On the day before yesterday, Mr. Zhang returned home for dinner. Unexpectedly, when he got off the bus at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin, he was suddenly arrested by the police. Subsequently, Japanese and French personnel searched Mr. Zhang's residence. Mr. Zhang is a pure journalist, and the reason for his sudden arrest is unknown.</p>

<p>Since the weather has been abnormal this summer and autumn, with irregular temperatures, local townships and towns in Songjiang have been experiencing prevalent seasonal diseases, especially dysentery and malaria. The general public already finds it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Once they fall ill, they have no remaining resources to seek medical treatment, causing many poor and sick people to suffer in silence, unable to seek treatment. This is a very pitiful situation. Now, Zhou, the director of the Shanghai office of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, has sent letters to various charitable organizations in Shanghai, such as the United Relief Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations, the Chinese Jisheng Association, and the Chinese Moral Society, requesting them to quickly allocate medicines for distribution to various townships to provide relief.</p>

<p>The Rotary Club is currently collecting various broken toys in order to repair them and distribute them to impoverished children at Christmas. It is said that the target for toy collection is a minimum of 10,000 toys. The scope of collection includes all kinds of books and toys, regardless of whether they are new or old, are welcome. This is because the repair shop is capable of repairing, painting, and renovating broken toys. Books are also being bound. This year's toy repair shop is still located at the Ha Ning Foreign Firm. According to the situation of impoverished children this year, the situation is even worse. It is hoped that all sectors of society will provide enthusiastic assistance. Anyone willing to help can send them to Matti at 640 Route Cardinal Foch, or call 13015 Marseille Wu and someone will be sent to collect them.</p>

<p>Xiang Dongchuan refused to be a pawn in the company's repeated fare increases, citing insufficient expenses, and therefore did not receive a ticket after paying the fare. When he requested one, he was instead pushed and killed by the ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang, who was embarrassed into anger. Public sentiment is very indignant. It is because the scalping of tickets has become an open secret, but everyone thinks it is a trivial matter and does not involve them, so they mostly let it go. But Xiang, with his upright nature, angered the ticket seller and unfortunately died unnaturally. People in society are all saddened by this. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited his home to record the details as follows:</p>
<p>Always Upright, Never Worked in Production</p>
<p>Xiang Dongchuan, courtesy name Junhai, is from Ruian, Wenzhou. He is 42 years old. He studied at Peking University in his early years and is the younger brother of Xiang Weichen, the former director of the Peking Salt Affairs Bureau. Xiang also worked in the bureau. He has always been clean and self-respecting, running around north and south for nearly 20 years. He is kind and approachable, and his nature is upright. He spends all his salary as soon as he receives it. He has eight children, three sons and five daughters. The eldest daughter is already engaged, and the youngest is not yet a month old. His elderly mother is still alive. After the war, he brought his family to Shanghai, but because he was unfamiliar with the people and places, his plans were mostly unsuccessful, so he was unhappy. The family's life cannot be sustained without 400 to 500 yuan, but he is the only one to rely on.</p>
<p>Son Sent to Sister's Home for Care</p>
<p>More than ten days before his tragic death, his wife gave birth to a son. Because she was weak after childbirth and unable to take care of her seven-year-old child, he entrusted the child to Xiang's sister on Avenue Sainte-Marie for care. That afternoon, Xiang took the No. 20 trolleybus from Yuyuan Road to his sister's place to see the child. At that time, he was wearing plain clothes because his father had just passed away, looking like a country bumpkin, and was not valued by people. Therefore, the ticket seller dared to forcibly act illegally, treating human life like grass, and pushed him down violently, causing him to fall and die. This can be based on the testimony of witnesses.</p>
<p>Waiting to Be Fed, Neighbors Feel Sad</p>
<p>Xiang's wife was in the postpartum period when she suddenly heard the bad news. She was devastated, resulting in insufficient breast milk. The newly born baby was hungry and unable to eat, crying sadly, further injuring her heart. She hopes to hire a wet nurse, but has no remaining funds. She also lacks the ability to buy milk powder. She now plans to send the child to a charitable organization to be raised, or to be adopted by someone as a godson. Now that Xiang has died tragically, causing his family to be separated, the neighbors who hear about it all feel saddened. This is truly what is called a living separation and death.</p>
<p>Cash Gifts Temporarily Provide for the Orphans and Widows</p>
<p>The Wenzhou Fellow Townsmen Association values ​​Xiang's character very much. Surprised and saddened by the bad news, in addition to mourning, they plan to launch an appeal for donations at the time of the memorial service for Xiang's family, informing all sectors of society to widely donate gifts, all in cash, so that his orphans, widows, old and young, can maintain their lives for the time being. As for his lifelong pension, his family will file a private lawsuit with the court, calculated at 4,000 yuan per year until Xiang is 60 years old, demanding that the company to which the ticket seller belongs bear the responsibility for payment.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Strict Investigation by Police Authorities: Major Suppression of Drug Trafficking Activities; Unprecedented Sharp Decrease in Drug Cases in the Courts; Significant Reduction in Transportation Difficulties and Transactions <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," it was learned yesterday (the 24th) that in recent months, drug trafficking cases in the area south of Suzhou Creek in the International Settlement have significantly decreased. Those familiar with the situation believe that the main reason for this decline is the increasing difficulty encountered by those smuggling drugs. Last year, the First Special District Court almost daily heard cases of drug smuggling. Today, however, the cases it hears are mostly related to opium smoking and operating "swallows' nests" (opium dens), with only occasional cases of selling heroin and other drugs. This indicates that while drug trafficking activities, once rampant in the International Settlement, have not been completely eradicated, the vigilance of the Settlement authorities has become more stringent, forcing drug traffickers to be more cautious when attempting to bring drugs into the International Settlement. Furthermore, those assisting in this nefarious trade demand even greater compensation, which is another reason for the decline in drug trafficking activities. Although there are still enough ships available for drug traffickers to continue their illicit business, the fact that the number of ships docking at various ports in North China has decreased has dealt a significant blow to drug trafficking gangs. In the past, stokers on these ships would routinely pack opium and heroin in boxes, hide them in the coal piles, and upon arriving in Shanghai, take out the drugs and throw them overboard, where pre-arranged sampans would collect them one by one. While this method is still used today, it is less frequent due to increased surveillance by the authorities, higher smuggling costs, and the reluctance of sailors to participate. Therefore, drug traffickers have had to lie low and wait for easier opportunities to act again.</p>
<p>However, it is generally believed that the decline in drug trafficking activities is only seen in the International Settlement and in areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, as the Police Department has been making every effort to curb drug trafficking for the past six months. Those who sell heroin, opium, and red pills do not have a central organization, and for the convenience of trade, they rely on third parties for distribution. Many of these distributors are Koreans, who pass the drugs to those who run drug dens or to drug users. From the drug cases handled by the courts, it can be seen that after the drugs arrive in Shanghai, they are immediately purchased by Koreans. These people often set up drug dens in Hongkou and Guanbei, and their customers are mainly Chinese. However, when the police raid drug dens, they have also found foreign vagrants among them, who are only fined and then released. Although those who actively engage in drug trafficking are given heavier punishments, they are not as severe as those stipulated by Chinese criminal law. Chinese criminal law stipulates that those who traffic or use drugs, as well as those involved in drug trafficking, are severely punished. Therefore, the First Special District Court sentences such individuals to deprivation of civil rights, imprisonment from five to fifteen years, and other more severe penalties. Many believe that there are currently individuals monopolizing opium in Shanghai, but this has not yet been confirmed. Their central organization is likely located in an area outside the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. Distributors often obtain several ounces or pounds of drugs, which they then sell in the Settlement, always arranging to deliver the goods and receive payment in quiet alleys, and continue to order drugs. Sometimes, they would notify buyers in advance, arranging for them to meet on a certain day to distribute small quantities of drugs. Although drug trafficking activities in the International Settlement have now decreased to an unprecedented level, after the end of the Shanghai war and the westward movement of the Chinese army, the rampant drug trade in Shanghai was unprecedented. Most of the drugs were shipped to Shanghai from ports such as Tianjin, Beiping, and Hankou, apparently due to the lax control over drug exports in these ports. About a year ago, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs seized opium worth four million yuan, which was probably the largest amount of opium seized in the history of the Jianghai Customs. Last year, several drug traffickers were arrested and confessed in the First Special District Court that they belonged to a drug trafficking gang based in Tianjin, and that opium and other drugs were supplied by Tianjin. The gang members have been rounded up with the cooperation of the Tianjin authorities, but this is still not enough to deter others from following suit.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Soliciting Sales of White Rice: Fraudulent Acquisition of Money <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Victims Can Report to the Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a Chinese man went to a residence on Rue Cardinal Foch, soliciting sales of white rice, quoting a price of sixty-eight yuan per picul, which was much cheaper than the market price. The resident immediately instructed his daughter to go and collect the rice. However, on the tram, the rice seller was recognized by someone who had been defrauded of money by him using the same method several days ago. He was then arrested and sent to the police station. The rice seller, named Ye Di-di-di, twenty-seven years old, residing on East Zilaihuo Street, had recently been using the following method to defraud people of money: first soliciting sales of cheap rice, and once the money was in hand, going with the buyer to the delivery location, but upon arriving there, taking the money and disappearing like a yellow crane. The suspect has confessed to committing several similar cases of fraud. Victims are requested to report to the Detective Division of the French Police Station at 22 Rue Tenant de la Tour, in order to verify the case.</p>

<p>More than a thousand workers at the Gonghexiang and Shuntai wharves in Hongkou went on a joint strike on the 18th of last month, due to demands for improved treatment, which resulted in bloodshed. After mediation by various parties, the striking workers resumed work on the 1st of this month. The negotiation phase continued with both parties consulting together. It is now reported that the case has been settled through negotiations between labor and management. Both sides have also signed a complete agreement, providing generous compensation and medical expenses for the workers who were killed or injured in the shooting.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Doctors Are Public Servants of Society! <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>At this time and in this place, having food to eat is already a fortunate thing, so why eat too much? There are still people dying from overeating, but they shouldn't be; because they do, a group of people starve to death.</p>
<p>It is not an exorbitant demand for us to ask for the living resources sufficient to sustain life, but most people have been getting thinner all along. The nutritional problem of the people is truly the most serious reality. Not to mention the vagrants on the streets who lack vitamins ABCD, even among the student groups recently, there are already many malnourished "too thin students," and some have even become consumptive. The percentage is frightening.</p>
<p>When you become a patient due to malnutrition, you more urgently need to wait for treatment, but now it costs twenty-five yuan to eat a pound of cod liver oil, and what about getting a shot of Cibamin? Occasionally asking a doctor for advice and being given a prescription will only make your condition worse!</p>
<p>It is undeniable that a group of noble doctors seem to be holed up in an ivory tower. Refusing to see patients late at night is considered status, and going to register during the day, they arrive late at night. If the consultation fee is doubled, they can come earlier, or even come right away.</p>
<p>But doctors are said to have the heart to cut flesh to save others since ancient times, and good doctors who "embrace the suffering of the people" do not seem to be copying the ancients. Being a doctor does not seem to be a charitable job, but even if they are "national doctors," if they value themselves too much, causing ordinary people to step back, that is the most selfish thing. Some senior good doctors did not accumulate property, and treated patients no differently than family members, and were always worried that they were not doing their best in clinical practice. To this day, they are still highly praised and their good reputation is endlessly praised; some modern doctors, still demand the full consultation fee from poor relatives, in order to show their impartiality (?), but in fact, they have accumulated millions, so what is the point?</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Chulin Sun Hospital sponsored the Chinese Health Association, and its declaration is truly a genuine prescription: "... All the doctors and important medicines in the country should be nationalized and allocated for the life-saving medicines needed, which cannot be manipulated by others! Doctors are not a free profession, they are public servants of society. The goal of medicine is to improve health and eliminate disease, not luxury goods." These words are spoken from the mouth of a professional, and are truly extremely painful. May we, based on this original intention, move forward bravely, allow everyone to see it, and create benefits for society, that would be fortunate!</p>
<h3 id="e94">Ticket Sellers Complain of Suffering Due to the "Squeezing Oil" Problem <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>We recently received a letter from Wu Guang, Wu Sheng, and other ticket sellers of the British Tramway Company. They said, "This is a collective request from us, and these are the words that the ticket sellers want to say but have no opportunity to say." We sympathize with them very much, so we have published the letter below.</p>
<p>Xiang Dongchuan's death in a fall from a tram is something that everyone should care about and help with. Whether Wang Wanxiang "squeezed oil" or not is a factual question and a legal question. At the beginning of the incident, it was difficult to determine before the truth was fully understood, but when the court recently tried the case, the police lawyer requested that Wang be sentenced to criminal punishment, which shows the general situation of this case. Of course, if Wang Wanxiang is completely wronged, the citizens should also help to clear his name.</p>
<p>After this letter is published, we will wait quietly for the fair judgment of the court on the Wang Wanxiang case. If there are letters of the same nature, we will not continue to publish them.</p>
<p>Since the incident of Wang Wanxiang, ticket seller number 358 of the British Tramway Company, falling and killing passenger Xiang Dongchuan, the general public in Shanghai and various newspapers have been criticizing and blaming us. We generally do not oppose the opinions of knowledgeable people in society, but we have always felt that it is regrettable that the media has not assumed its educational responsibility, nor has it analyzed the problem.</p>
<p>Whether ticket seller Wang Wanxiang should bear legal responsibility and what is right and wrong will eventually come to light. This is a legal question, and we will not discuss it for the time being. What we want to appeal to all citizens of Shanghai and the media is the real life situation of our ticket sellers: First of all, there should be some explanation for the so-called "squeezing oil" problem for ticket sellers. In the eyes of the citizens of the whole city, the company raises prices again and again, and the whole public satirizes this as a result of ticket sellers "squeezing oil." But which of the public utilities in Shanghai has not raised prices again and again? Everyone knows that the ticket sellers of the French Tramway do not "squeeze oil," so why is the fare not cheaper than the British Tramway? If the British Tramway authorities have not yet obtained a suitable way to improve the administration, no matter how many ticket inspectors are added, and do not fundamentally improve the minimum living treatment of each employee, and cooperate with well-organized and good ticket sellers, it is fundamentally impossible to eradicate this habit of the past thirty years, especially in today's high cost of living. Secondly, regarding the general attitude of the ticket sellers, we believe that it is easier to talk about this issue in front of our fellow Chinese. Here, passengers can think carefully, isn't our attitude very friendly when there are few passengers in the car? When there are many passengers, there may be some bad attitudes, but this bad attitude is not intentional to be against the passengers, nor is there any deep hatred with the passengers. Moreover, the quality of passengers varies, and some passengers do not buy tickets when they get on the bus, which is discovered by the ticket inspector, and as a result, the company often imposes a penalty of no less than ten or twenty yuan. Do people in society understand our hidden pain? We have not received any understanding or sympathy from people in society.</p>
<p>If our appeal can be published in your newspaper, this is a collective request from us, and these are the words that most of our ticket sellers want to say but have no opportunity to say. Signed, ticket sellers Wu Guang, Wu Sheng, etc. (No remuneration)</p>

<h3 id="e95">How I Work as a Waitress <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>In the year I was about to graduate, my father unfortunately died of illness. My mother decided to ask me to drop out of school and get a job. As a result of my mother and I running around, we were either given the cold shoulder or politely refused. After a period of time, my mother's younger sister, my second aunt, agreed to introduce me to work as a waitress.</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, my second aunt took me to a large hotel - it was the place I would be working - a steel and concrete building, luxurious and magnificent inside, with melodious music, sometimes rising and sometimes falling. Modern ladies, arm in arm, went in and out, and my second aunt and I also walked into this large hotel in the crowd. We waited for an hour or two before we finally met Mr. ×, the accountant, a middle-aged man in his thirties, with his hair slicked back, wearing a light gray suit. My second aunt exchanged a few polite words with him, and then explained the purpose of our visit. Then he turned those large, frightening eyes on me and said:</p>
<p>"The appearance is very good, but it seems too honest."</p>
<p>"Yes! I also said that, no matter what, I must ask you to help, we are sure of it." My second aunt quickly followed up.</p>
<p>"Okay! Miss Er, for your sake, ha... hey! Come to work tomorrow." After speaking, he walked away.</p>
<p>On the way home, my second aunt showed me great concern, teaching me many ways to treat people and handle things, and repeatedly told me to apply more powder and rouge tomorrow, and dress up well. If I didn't have clothes, she could lend them to me. I agreed to everything.</p>
<p>Now I am starting a new life - a life with an indescribable taste. I spend all day in the wine-scented and food-filled dining room, serving adults, wives, young masters, and young ladies, walking back and forth, and when I am busy, I don't even have time to eat. When I am free, I am not allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Mr. X always stares at me with big eyes, rolling around. Ah Ying secretly told me: "He is a bad guy, he specializes in wanting to take advantage of women, he looks like he is thinking about you."</p>
<p>"Hey! Boy, no, Girl, come quickly." The young fellow is calling me again. He is wearing a white suit, waving his hand and saying to his friends: "This is a beautiful one, a new one." I have already walked to the dining table.</p>
<p>"Wait here, let us think," he said:</p>
<p>"Hey! Who do you think she looks like?" he asked his friends.</p>
<p>"No! McDonald." One defended.</p>
<p>"Not at all, she looks like Garbo, look! Aren't the eyes very similar?" Hehe... a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, what do you want?" I asked, suppressing my anger and putting on a smile.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha... we want, we want you to stand here and let us look at you." They said very naturally, and laughed even more recklessly.</p>
<p>I was numb, standing there blankly with my head down. Suddenly, a rude hand patted me on the shoulder, followed by a roll of something stuffed into my hand. When I looked up, these crazy fellows had already walked down the stairs. I picked up the thing in my hand and looked at it. It was two ten-yuan bills, with a note attached that read "Tonight × Hua is waiting for you, don't miss it."</p>
<p>Heavens, what is going on?</p>

<p>Twelve Unexpected Troubles</p>
<p>I am an old man, and those two fellows were useless. They were knocked down as soon as they moved. The person with a black cloth covering his face was the fiercest. In just a flash, he used a rope to tie up Lin Sheng tightly, immediately carried him on his back, and left like a whirlwind... Originally, it was not your family's business, and we wouldn't dare to trouble you, but according to the two fellows who were left behind, they were a group of people..."</p>
<p>The old man spoke almost breathless, and Begonia's heart was already beating faster than boiling water.</p>
<p>"Uncle Wu, this is what they said:" The daughter-in-law of the Meng family was originally a fast talker, and could not wait to interject. "They said that they only have a relationship with you, old man, and as long as you say a word, not only can the person be released, but the previous matter doesn't need to be pursued. So we specially came to beg you, please have mercy on my father-in-law, who only has this one root..."</p>
<p>"Brother Wu, we have been old neighbors for many years, please help me, and I will thank you later!" As Meng Lao Zhanggui said, he repeatedly bowed.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that Begonia was originally a sick person. Although her complexion changed, Meng Lao Zhanggui and his party could not see it.</p>
<p>"But, Lao Zhanggui," he was able to answer as if nothing had happened, only after finally calming down. "This matter is too strange. Who are those people after all? I haven't even seen them. How can I go and reason with them?" (Twenty-two)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Prospects for Go (Part 1) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Qing</p>
<p>Go is one of the national quintessences of our country. It was most prosperous during the Qi and Liang dynasties. Xiao Daocheng and Xiao Yan both loved it. For a time, the officials of the court became accustomed to it, and talents emerged in large numbers. The grandeur of the time can be seen in the fragments of records in the Book of Southern Qi, the Book of Liang, and the History of the North. It is a pity that the historians did not record the war in detail, and none of the diagrams from that time have been passed down, so it is impossible to compare their merits with the chess players of later generations. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, chess matters have been very sparse, only surviving through circulation. During the Qing Dynasty, Guobailing (the Guo family were descendants of the Ming Dynasty) sorted out old diagrams and created new diagrams (namely, the "Xianji Wuku" and "Sizi Pu" etc.). Xu Xingyou was the first to create chess reviews (namely, "Jianshantang Yipu"), and the art of go began to revive. Mr. Huang Longshi was outstanding in the early years of Kangxi. In modern times, the evaluation of our country's chess skills, from ancient times to the present, has not exceeded Huang Longshi. (Huang's name was Qiu, and his courtesy name was Longshi. He was from Taizhou. He became a national player when he was more than ten years old. Du Chucun's "Biantang Wenji" has a preface to Huang, and later he changed his name to Xia, and his courtesy name was Yuetian). From Kangxi to the early years of Qianlong, there were many national players, and at that time, Liang (Wei Jin), Cheng (Lanru), Shi (Xiangxia), and Fan (Xiping) were called the leaders. It declined slightly at the end of Qianlong. At that time, there were only second-hand players and no first-hand players. (See "Yuewei Caotang Notes"). During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, Chen Zixian and Zhou Xiaosong were the most famous, but Xiaosong said to people that he admitted that if he met Shi Fan, he would not be able to defeat them. After Xiaosong passed away, there were no successors. By the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, it was a period of decline in the art.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in modern times, there is Wu Qingyuan from Fujian, who was able to overwhelm all the players of the time at the age of sixteen, and then went to Japan to study, where he learned from the people of that country, worked hard to invent, the "Tengen Three-Star" and other tactics, and the style of go changed suddenly. Old diagrams in bookstores were almost ignored. The Japanese called his chess quality to have the style of the chess saint Shusaku, and also regarded him as a strange child (meaning prodigy), and also called him a flower chess national player (that is, the four-four and fourteen and central and other positions on the chessboard all have flowers as marks), and also called him the "Black Invincible." He lived in Japan for several years, and his rank advanced rapidly. At the age of twenty-two, due to physical weakness, he followed his doctor's advice to take a temporary rest, and also returned to China for a few months. During his rest period of about one or two years, although he did not compete with the outside world, his ambition to improve has never been relaxed. When he came out to face his opponents again, his style of go was even more severe. Recently, in a ten-game match with Mr. Kiyoshi Kitani (Mr. Kitani won the Honinbo title nine years ago), he won six games to take the lead, and then the press recommended the only remaining old eighth dan Jyunichi Karigane to come out and compete, and ten games were scheduled. The first game was recently revealed, and Mr. Karigane, holding black, has already resigned in the middle game.</p>
<p>The results of his ten games can be imagined. Wu is called a seventh-dan chess player in Japan, but judging from his record, his strength must have reached the ninth dan. He can be compared with Mr. Huang Longshi of the previous generation. Moreover, he is only a young man of twenty-eight years old, and his character and temperament are extremely excellent.

<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>After the New Year's Eve dinner, everyone was happily preparing for the New Year, especially the younger siblings who were not yet adults, were even busier. Juexin returned to his room, looked at the plum blossoms in the pot, and then looked at the curtain fringe that his cousin Mei had painted for him before, and he felt a little sad. At the same time, Juehui and Mingfeng also met in front of the hall, intending to confide in each other, but his sister Shuying called Mingfeng away, so Juehui's heart was also a little unhappy. The happiest ones were Juemin and Zhang Yunhua, who were in the same room, talking eloquently, as if their two hearts had already merged into one.</p>
<p>Juexin and Mei were an established tragedy, and they were not supposed to have any contact with each other. Unexpectedly, after Mei remarried, her husband died within a short period of time, and she returned to her mother's home. Thus, this pair of ill-fated lovers met again in the same place, and over time, Li Ruijue also learned about this. Although she sympathized with Mei's situation, she had no way to resolve this dispute. She once confessed to Mei that she was willing to step aside and let Mei and Juexin get together. However, Mei did not dare to agree, thinking that this was too much of a loss to others and a benefit to herself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Juehui not only forgot his status because of his love for Mingfeng, but he even frankly told Mingfeng that he would formally marry her as his wife. This was naturally a pleasant surprise for Mingfeng, and she also told Juehui that she had been taught by Juehui's eldest sister. Since Juehui's eldest sister died, she loved only Juehui, besides her mother. She expressed that she would fight for Juehui to the end and would never easily submit because she was a slave.</p>
<p>As for Juemin and Zhang Yunhua, although they were already in love, they felt a sense of worry about the unpredictability of human affairs. However, they both believed that this marriage would not be like Juexin and Mei's. Even if they faced the same obstacles as Juexin and Mei, they would not easily break up. Because Yunhua's will was stronger, and Juemin was more decisive than his eldest brother.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: A Crown of Fury for a Beautiful Woman</p>
<p>Wu Sangui saw that both of them were handsome young men and was very happy. He immediately appointed them to the position of bajong and had them serve under his command along with Zhang, Chen, and others. The two thanked him for his kindness. Wu Sangui heard that Xu Jing had come from Ningwu Pass, so he asked them to sit down and asked about the situation of the rebels. Xu Jing answered one by one, saying that the power of the rebels was growing day by day, which was worrying, but the worrying thing was that the local officials could not communicate with each other and use the method of fortified walls and clearing the fields to deal with them. And the military officers sent by the imperial court were all sometimes suppressing and sometimes appeasing, with no fixed purpose, and no determination to make decisive decisions, and the soldiers were unwilling to fight, so they could not defeat the rebels. Moreover, the people in various places were forced by hunger and cold due to years of famine and were ready to revolt. As soon as the rebels arrived, many local ruffians, vagrants, and refugees would act as their internal support, often rising up in response, so their power was like a wildfire, unapproachable. Sangui listened and agreed. Zhang Cang also said, "General, you are following the imperial decree to send troops into the pass to suppress the rebels, which is a matter of great importance. However, the Manchus are eyeing us with their newly rising power, always wanting to invade. The current temporary peace is not reliable. Once the general leads a large army into the pass, how can they not take the opportunity to move? I am afraid that the general's mighty army will enter Shanhaiguan in the morning, and the Manchu iron cavalry will rush to Ningyuan in the evening." Sangui listened and nodded, saying, "What Bajong Zhang said is not without reason. But if I enter the pass, the defense here cannot be easily abandoned. I should order Youji Chai to stay here to guard against any eventuality. The current situation is really very critical. Externally, we cannot ignore it, and internally, it is like putting out a fire, which cannot be delayed. The emperor has no troops to deploy, so he summoned me to enter the pass to protect the capital."</p>
