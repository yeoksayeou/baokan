<h3 id="c5">羅斯福宣示緊急狀態存在 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>昨日中午、羅斯付總統在入合世界的緊張期待之中。發表了具有歷史意義的爐邊談話，指出了目前國際局勢的嚴重性，及以巡邏隊保證必要物品運至英國的必要，並且檢討制海權的決定作用，聲述海洋自由的傳統要求。更於演說之後宣布全國無限制緊急狀態之存在，要求將美國國防國力及權威加強到極端限度。此一表示和措施，雖然距離實際參戰尙差一間，羅斯福總統已經在最適當的時機舉起了他的劍。</p>
<p>此决是本屆羅氏就任後第二次的爐邊談話，距去冬那一决為時不過五閱月，而在政策上已有加速度的飛躍，在那决僅止妥求美國為反抗侵略作戰的民主國家担負兵工廠的任務，今茲則不僅進一步引運送戰具到達為已任而且明白聲言美國將以堅決行動應付侵略者的挑釁，以視上决大戰在德方宣布無限制潛艇戰後幾將兩年美國始採參戰行動者，顯然時間與主動的因素，現在已發揮着重大作用。羅氏在講演中要求聽衆對於攻擊意義作現實觀念，須連帶想及今日行動之閃電式行動云云，實為對其自身政策急劇演進之最好的說明。在五個月以前，美當局尙不能不苦心孤詣的以美國不遭戰禍波及為加緊援助民治民國的理由向國民呼籲，時至今日，美國民則已能以緊張而嚴肅的姿態接受無限緊急狀態存在的宣布，足徵羅氏政策之轉趨積極，一方適應着急劇演變的國際局勢，另一方面，又反映着美國人民普遍的心理。至低限度，參戰的機運已有六成以上的成熟，侵略者的戰爭威脅，再不能把美國嚇退了。</p>
<p>所謂海上自由問題，似乎過涉抽象與原則，其實却是美國的傳統要求，曾在威爾遜有名的十四條中間列在第二條的重要地位。當前决大戰開始之際，美國輿情顯見混沌，不似此决自始已表現着非常明顯的反侵略立塲，而且彼時德奧方面在美的外交活動雖遠不如英法之精明透剔，亦較此决之絕無活動餘地者顯有不同，然而却終於增强了美人對德憤恨心理，以至絕對站在協的國方面對德作戰者，主要是海上的種種問題有以促成。現在英德間的海上爭鬥，一方加緊封鎖，一方襲擊商船，正與前此情况相類似。同樣的問題現在又將美國推動動到參戰的邊沿。固然，運送戰具到達英國與實行參戰之間尙隔有相當距離，但是德力拚命阻止美方運送戰具的行動必難免造成比較上决琉西坦尼亞和蘇塞克斯兩輪之被襲擊更為嚴重的後果，彼時美國將除却參戰而外，絕無任何其他途徑可尋。羅斯福總統之所以在要求海洋自由的同時又宣布全國緊急狀態之存在，正是一種爭取機先的必耍準備，用以應付未來非常事變的發生，除非德國有意避免更進一步的刺激美國，抑或英國已有充分力量制服德方在大西洋的剽襲、容或可能延緩美國的斷然行動，但那在目前均鮮可能，以是美國之由目前的緊急狀態存在達到參戰，大槪不會經過很長人的距離。</p>
<p>連日納粹軍在克里特島的戰鬥，出了慘重代價卻未獲得理想的效果，此後即使竭力增援，以孤注一擲的姿態獲取對該島的佔領，亦復無法遮掩業已暴露了的弱點。大西洋的海戰，英方以荷特號拚了德方的俾斯麥號，兩艦本身的損失固然銖輛悉稱，但英方不過去掉了主力艦的十五分之一，德方則竟犧牲到了三分之一，自然也是德方受了更大的打擊。但却不能因此而過份低估德國侵略的實力，即以大西洋與地中海的剽襲而論，最近英方船隻沉沒的統計數字仍舊高到驚人，這無疑是英國的致命打擊　為美方朝野所不能坐視的。而且納粹控制世界的企圖，成功希望固然渺茫，其觸鬚則巳以地中海為中心分途向着亞洲西部和大西洋方面伸張，假如希特勒竟能在東地中海和非洲西北海岸得手，則茫茫廣宇，將沒有一個地方不感受侵略者的威脅。於此益足彰明英國苦戰所提供於整個世界的偉大貢獻，而太平洋上則因中國戰爭的牽制，致使未來準備響應納粹攻勢者至今仍不得不繼續在趦趄觀望之中。羅總統在其演講之中對於中英的作戰盛加讚許，絕非溢美之詞，就着遏阻侵略的世界意義而言，中英確無愧於美國軍用品的擴大援助。</p>
<p>整個的世界已因羅斯福氏的雄偉呼聲與斷然措置而感到莫大的震撼，這是侵略罪惡的喪鐘，同時也就是民治與正義勝利的紀程碑。</p>

<p>倫敦於去年十二月二十九日的夜裏，遭德機大規模轟炸，發生空前大火，文化界所受的浩刦，不下其他各業。著名出版公司如納邇遜，朗孟斯，勃勒克胡特，考林斯，華特洛克，桑沛生羅，赫慶遜，司樸蒂斯伍特，希特韋特，辛普根馬歇爾，以至其他較小書店，多被全部或局部摧毀，損失書籍，不下六百萬册之多。</p>
<p>但英國的出版商和售書商並不稍感氣餒。他們趕緊另覓地址，不到幾天功夫，地址探定，職員紛紛歸來，在新奇的環境中，照常營業了。其中辛普根馬歇爾書店有英語世界最大發行所之稱，此决罹刦慘重，損失書籍三百萬冊，幾乎一蹶不振，嗣由出版業聯合會收買該店全部生財，營業因而不致中斷。</p>
<p>新公司採用合作社的方式，不尙牟利，營業概由出版業聯合會人員管理。在倫敦設中央發行所四處，將各種書籍分發各書店零售，故此後英國出版公司將專做批發。史密斯父子書局原視辛普根馬歇爾書局為批發方面的唯一勁敵，此决也肯在患難中加以援手，眞是難得。</p>
<p>德機轟炸倫敦，圖書館也連帶遭殃，大學院圖書館藏書四十萬冊，被燬的十萬册，其中多係德國歷史與文學珍本。後來從瓦礫中檢點殘册，第一本找到的是「德國文化史」倒很耐人尋味。</p>
<p>英國在空襲之餘，藉以消遺的，讀書即其一種。圖書館事業因而頗有一種新氣象。</p>
<p>例如聖潘克拉鎭，現巳創設流動圖書館，裝在一輛載重汽車上，備書二千冊，每星期往來各地，以便讀者更換書籍。因之，民團汽球防空隊，高射砲隊，以及其他不能擅離職守的部隊，都享到就地讀書的便利。紅十字會等救護團體也都組織圖書服務隊，邱吉爾首相最幼的女公子，亦參加服務。</p>
<p>倫敦各大報，自開戰以來，巳縮小篇幅三分之二。現在售價一便士的報紙，又巳從十九面减至每星期四天出四面，其餘三天出六面。兩便士的報紙，則從二十二面减至十面。</p>
<p>大部份報館（方派每日先驅報和新聞紀事報除外），雖受紙張與銷數的限制及紙漿昂貴的影響（紙漿每噸已從十一　高及幹部人員外，的有百分之鎊五仙令漲至二十六鎊十仙二十五被政府徵發，投筆從戎令），但照舊賺錢。推原其故去了。大部份從報館對於這些約有多端：一，讀者　不過份軍的職員？照　　薪，按半至九鎊。封面四角及評論附近的特等地位，亦已漲至十鎊至十五鎊。廣吿地位最大不得超過兩格十一英寸，其刋價已與戰前半版地位相等。一便士的報紙最近又把每面七格改為八格，每格尺寸縮小，但廣吿費昭舊，這樣一來，廣吿收入就無形中增加了。好在廣吿地位求過於供，各報落得牟利。</p>
<p>各報人手减少之後，編輯先生忙不開交，有時兼充茶房。每日快報編輯克利斯興說得好，我自己倒字紙麓。我們這輩沒有微發出去的人，事事都自己動手，好比一羣看家狗。</p>
<p>各大報篇幅雖然縮小，內容未見遜色。各種新聞，限於地位，都編得實行精編，社論也把握住要點發揮幾句，不得說廢話，經此嚴格的束之後，英國的報紙倒反更加適合讀者口味了。</p>
<p>减少。泰晤士報和每日電報兩家且堅請讀者向附近報攤預先登記，退報的弊端因而無形消滅。二，內部職員，除年事過數發給，因而省下一筆開銷。三，報紙篇幅縮小之後，廣吿費業已大加。普通廣吿地位，戰前每　定五鎊的，現已漲</p>

<p>自由談治軍十誡郭洪迪</p>
<p>現代軍隊在行軍的時候，軍紀是非常重要的。英國方面有鑒於此，特頒佈誡命十條，給下級軍官遵守，內容大要如下：</p>
<p>（一）不要譏諷人，發脾氣，或咒罵人。</p>
<p>（二）不要在人家背後說人壞話，也不要偏袒不公。</p>
<p>（三）自己不準備做的事，別命令別人做，而且你該曉得怎樣做可以做得比別人好。</p>
<p>（四）隨時使部下忙碌而發生興趣。</p>
<p>（五）熱心參加部下的娛樂。</p>
<p>（六）任意下屬家裏的事。</p>
<p>（七）注意部下的飲食起居。</p>
<p>（八）在任何情形之下，設法使服飾整潔。</p>
<p>（九）一個人的失望並非事出無因的，把他失望的原因找出來。</p>
<p>（十）認識並了起解你的部下。</p>
<p>這些雖然是治軍的誡條，但是也可以作在社會上做人的參考。</p>

<h3 id="c25">雞 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 味橄</p>
<p>我從前　北平的時候，畫師齊白石曾贈我一幅小雞圖，活躍如生，我尤愛他用淡墨浸出一重小雞的絨毛，特別溫柔可撫。十年來朝夕相對，使我特別愛好小雞了。現在這些小雞都具體地在我眼前草地上跳動，發出嚶嚶的聲音，多麼惹憐愛。我每日看着它們生長，看到它們每當老鷹飛過屋頂時，也知道躱入草叢中，或跑到屋子里來，我臉上常要浮出一種滿　的微笑。物雖小而保護生命的本能都是有的，造物的力量眞是不可思議呀。</p>
<p>野食旣多，它們便長得特別的快，羽毛漸豐，雌雄也辨得出來了。世界上無用之物，雖遭人唾棄，然而得以全其身，反之，棟樑之材，必遭坎伐，有用之物，終將被人利用。可憐這些小雞，一到雌雄可辨的時候，便是它們死期被注定的關頭。而掌握它們生殺之權的人類，這時便只知為自己打算，把它們的生命早置諸外了。</p>
<p>這時第一件事情，我們想到的，是雄雞的無用。雄雞長大了，雖然美觀，卻不好吃，而且不能生產。我們至多只留下一隻雄雞傳種就得了，其餘的都安排趁着它們骨柔肉嫩的時候，先殺了來吃，炒子雞確是一碗下酒的名菜呢。</p>
<p>我們所養的雞中有四隻是雄雞，都在這種注定的運命之下，先後因主人有客來而被宰割了。最後只剩一隻特別幸運的雄雞，帶着一帬母雞逍遙在我們的屋前屋後。此時我們的心境完全變了，我們都用一種　利主義的眼光來看它們，圖畫上的小雞時代早已過去。它們已經不美了，早失了吸引人的能力，旣無畫意，也無詩情。它們這時對人類唯一的貢獻，就是發揮它們女性的本能，多多地生產，給人類的屠刀下以不斷的供給。</p>
<p>我每天在課餘之暇，看着院子里這一帬雞，心里就有一種感想。</p>
<p>「你看這不是一夫多妻制嗎？」有一天我竟對我的太太無意中這樣說出來。</p>
<p>「你們男子都希望一夫多妻，所以就注意到了；我到從來沒有想到雞也是一夫多妻的。」她以嘲弄的口吻回答了。</p>
<p>「不過這種一夫多妻制，並不是自然的規律，而是人工造成的。我因此而想到的是人類中也有這同樣的事情發生，不過那只是幾個男子的野心，而不是一般男子的野心；而且那幾個男子自己倒並不一定是多妻主義者，不過他們希望其治下的男子都是多妻的。」</p>
<p>「那怎麼講，旣然自己不是多妻者，怎麼希望別人多妻？」她問。</p>
<p>「這不很簡單嗎？事實擺在眼前，誰都看得明白。」</p>
<p>於是我向她說到極權國家的情形。又問她是不是忘記了我們在倫敦報上看見的那個意大利的故事。據說有一次一個母親帶了八個孩子，到羅馬一家旅館里去投宿，旅館主人因見孩子太多，怕擾了其他的客人不安，竟拒絕了收容她們。後來事聞於墨索里尼，便下令把那家旅館封了。理由是國家正在獎勵生育，需要多男的時候，該旅館主人，何物小醜，竟斗膽敢嫌惡小孩，該當何罪！</p>
<p>現在那些極權國家的領袖們，因為抱着侵略的野心，需要無數的男子去當砲灰，所以特別獎勵生育，不僅生有三個兒子以上的母親政府有獎，而且給以津貼，甚至私生子政府亦有明令公認，總之，不論在任何方式之下，只要能給國家多造些國民出來就是好的。因為戰時無論軍火怎樣精良，人不夠總是沒有辦法的。軍火工廠里可以大量生產，人總得一個一個地告母親來生，而且不是臨時可以補充的。起碼得有二十年，才可以長成一個壯丁，供他們驅上戰塲去使用。</p>
<p>侵略家有見於此，所以在獎勵生育之名義之下，無形中早已形成了一種一夫多妻制，這個和我們養雞的辦法，一個道理。旣是獎勵多生兒子，又公認私生子，這自然等於提倡一夫多妻制。而且這種獎勵之下，產生出來的國民，還不是和雞一樣？一旦長成之後，就要送去屠宰的。寫到這里，我對於人為萬物之靈　句老話，覺得懷疑起來。　（完）</p>

<p>— 萍鏡</p>
<p>我剛走進弄堂，看見地上有一小碗飯，一隻肥狗正在拚命得意地嚼吃着。他不顧那隻瘦弱的小貓，這小貓只　偷偷地瞧牠，並不敢走近來一同享受這飯的美味。</p>
<p>我看了這情形，非常的替貓抱不平，耐無可耐地說道：「你應該分一些給這可憐的貓吃呀！」</p>
<p>牠不理我，還是拚命地吃</p>
<p>我怒了，叫道：「你這怎么的狗！」</p>
<p>牠輕視我，從鼻孔中發出冷酷的笑。</p>
<p>我氣極了：「這怎么無恥的狗，好大膽！」</p>
<p>不料牠倒抬起頭來，冷冷地回答道：「你們人類才是世界上最怎么無恥的動物。」同時又對我一笑。</p>
<p>「放屁，你說什麼？」我不能被一隻狗侮辱。</p>
<p>「哼！什麼？別假裝聾子，我說人類是最怎么無恥的。你看，住在高樓大厦中的富人，徧徧還要囤米，囤煤，囤絲，囤……」</p>
<p>我又害怕又憤怒，只當不聽見走開了。</p>
<p>可是道可惡的狗還大聲地叫：「只知囤積，發大財，不顧那千萬萬帬的平民，他們……</p>
<p>我開始放大了腳步逃了，逃到家裏。只聽見那得意揚揚的狗還在哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>「嗚，嗚，嗚，」工廠上工的鳴聲驚醒了我，摸摸頭上的汗，原來是一個夢！</p>

<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「我這個人窮雖窮，神　可大得很！譬如這半個月，我簡直沒有出過一次台，連一毛錢的份子也沒有分到；可是梅寳的病害得最厲害的時候，照樣替她請最有名的大夫，中醫西醫，一天換了幾個，到現在我也沒有替你向人家掛過什麼帳！我這個人就是這一些本領，你也不用　我發愁！」</p>
<p>「怪不得你酒也不喝，烟也不抽，說不公平還為我欠了一大筆的債！」秋海棠在床上輕輕地翻了一個身說：「我原想待七爺把我的東西收拾好送來，大家……！」</p>
<p>不等他說完，玉崑已懂得他要說的什麼話，而且不由不承認他是對的了。</p>
<p>「不錯，就是這幾天裏，你手下那幾個家伙怕要做出事來！」他把兩條衣袖略略擄起了一些，袖管上是至少已有着四五個破洞了。榮奎那小子第一個就靠不住！還虧你家裏沒有媳婦兒養着，不然他準會給你帶走的！」</p>
<p>秋海棠對於他這個師兄的不問什麼時候，不問什麼地方，一味的愛說笑話，直也毫無辦法。</p>
<p>他又在枕上翻了個身，腦神經很快地轉動着。</p>
<p>「二哥，梅寳究竟好全了沒有？」</p>
<p>「怎麼沒有！方才我還扶着她，在院子裏走了兩圈矮步咧！」</p>
<p>「那很好！」秋海棠微微透出了一些笑容說：「二哥，旣然這樣，就請你給我快回去看一看吧！也許現在還來得及。並且七爺畢竟怎麼樣了，我也惦記得很，你一去就可以想法子跟他見見了。」</p>
<p>玉崑不就答應，低下頭躊躇了好一會。</p>

<h3 id="c29">五胞胎個性的發展 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>世界聞名曾在銀幕上出現過的五胞胎，如今已十足的七週歲了。時間過得那麼快，現在的五胞胎，和我們當初在銀幕上所見的，已是完全不同了。在這裹，姑就五胞胎最近的個性轉變，的略的寫在下面。</p>
<p>在五胞胎之中，伊密兒Emile是一個最歡喜作弄的小姑娘。當初担任監護的迪福醫師，給她們五雙套鞋的時候吿訴她們這種鞋子是雨天穿的。但她會想出穿了套鞋，走進浴盆裏去洗浴。的確，她每會想出各種玩　，就是在　育她們的時候，她也最會表示懷疑。</p>
<p>伊密兒和瑪麗Marie，當五胞胎誕生之初，是最小而挺弱的兩個。但無論在氣力方面，活動方面，都慢慢的追到她們的幾位姊姊了。她們有一種習慣，時常注意着幾個姊姊，允其是瑪麗，很勇敢的去模仿姊姊們的動作。但騎自由車，比不上幾個姊姊走得快，可是她能知怎樣騎法。對於自然界，動物，及其他一切，時常會提出疑問。一切的一切，都可表現出她會知道怎樣去運用她的頭腦。所以將來她或許會充當教帥呢！</p>
<p>伊奧妮Yronne和安妮黛Annette兩人，她們巳表現出很有做領袖的資格。她們會替五胞胎中別個姊妹做保護者。伊奧妮的個性比較剛强，她在五胞胎中，和參觀的人是最容易發生友誼的一個。而對於她自己的動作，也最有自信力。人們會相信到將來，在她一個班子裏，人們都會投她的票，選她做領袖也許可成為一個女商人。</p>
<p>安妮黛是對一件事情失收了，會最後表示承認。但任何事件，就是尙未成功，她會首先表示樂觀，自誇起來。新影</p>
<p>茜塞兒Cecile是一個外科醫師有着很漂亮的馬車和極自然的態度。她對於音樂，更表現出有着充分的大才。通常每是會獨唱起來而跳幾下舞，祇要聽到無綫雷與留音機在奏樂，便不自主的跳舞了。將來她許會成一個音樂家或發明家</p>
<p>現在，所有五胞胎的學校敎育，由一個全日上課的敎師担任，並由安的里奧省敎育委員負責監督。宗敎敎育也在推進，她們會做晨夕禱古，並於每星期日，到敎堂中去做禮拜。總之，五個女孩子，愈長愈活潑呢。</p>

<p>第十章　公孫劍氣初第一</p>
<p>許蜻剛仲手去抽取他背上的寳劍時，不由大吃一驚！原來在他的背上祇剩一個空空的劍鞘，自已生平珍愛的赤鳳寳劍忽然不翼而飛了！他定着心神一想，自己在柳家出來時，明明將這寳劍揹在背上的，怎麼到了這裏忽地不見呢？莫不是鬼摸頭嗎？自己平素不信鬼神的，即有鬼物也不敢向我許靖來揶揄。也許給他人乘我不覺時偷取去了。然而自己一路前來，鬼不知神小覺的，並沒給人家窺見，那人在什麼時候把赤鳳劍取去的呢？若果是的，那人的本領又是不小，遠出在我之上了。但是此間除了王永泰，並無他人擅長武術，那麼這件事大足驚異了。這柄赤鳳寳劍是自己心愛之物，得來煞非容易，現在忽然無緣無故的失去，况且又是一刹那間的事，豈可不查個水落石出，以冀珠還合浦呢？於是他丟下室裏的奸夫淫婦，要去找尋竊他寳劍的人。好在他們好夢方酣，不到天曙決不會分　的，讓他們去貪片刻之歡罷。立即返身，飛上屋頂，向四處張望，只因在月黑之夜，自己夜眼的功夫尙淺，望到速處去不甚淸楚。似乎遠遠地在前而有個黑影一閃，他連忙追過去。只見那黑影飛也似的向後面奔跑，他心裏暗想果然有了外邊人了，我的赤鳳寳劍，一定是被那人竊去的，遂加緊脚步追去。那黑影祇向後邊跑，一會兒巳至屋後外牆，飄身落下。許靖一想，被他逃走了，如何肯捨棄呢？跟着跳下；但是等他跳到地下時，却又不見了他追的黑影。再向前走了數步，深巷寂寂，杳無人影，間有一二犬吠聲，凄厲如豹。許靖立定了脚步，心中異常納悶，自己怪自己太疏忽一些，怎麼人家從他的背上竊取寳劍，竟會絲毫沒有覺得呢？這豈非是滑天下之大稽嗎？那黑影又不知到那裏去了，可見那人的本領比我高强數協，即使被我追及，我如何能够向他索還寳劍呢？他若然肯還我的，叉何必竊則？總而言之，自己太沒有功夫，慚愧之至。那麼我回轉威鳳山去嗎？但也自己交代不過了。（七五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. President's Broadcast Speech Yesterday Morning: Declares Unlimited National Emergency <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>States that the U.S. will Definitely Fight if Attacked, Protecting the Provision of Additional Aid to the Government of China</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt addressed the nation and the world last night, delivering a highly anticipated and important speech, declaring that an unlimited national emergency now exists. President Roosevelt stated resolutely that the United States will definitely fight if attacked. The President also reiterated that the United States will fulfill its promise to provide supplies to democracies. He said, "We have guaranteed material assistance to other democracies in the world, and we will fulfill this guarantee. We in the Americas will decide if, when, and where our American interests are attacked or our national security is threatened. We are now placing our armed forces in strategically important positions. We will not hesitate to use these armed forces to repel attacks against us. Given the current state of the world, should the United States hesitate to adopt all the plans necessary to maintain our American freedom? I have issued a declaration on this matter. Our people and government will not hesitate to confront this challenge. We reaffirm the inherent principle of maritime freedom of the United States. If not for two secret factors, Hitler's plan to dominate the world would have been close to success. What are these two factors? They are the heroic resistance of Great Britain and the valiant defense of China. Some may think the U.S. has not been attacked until bombs fall on New York or San Francisco. But know that any base that threatens our security, once dominated, will be the start of an attack on the U.S. The Axis powers will never achieve their goal of world domination unless they first gain maritime power. This is their greatest goal today. To gain maritime power, they must first conquer Great Britain before they can powerfully advance into the Western Hemisphere. If the Axis powers fail to gain maritime power, they will inevitably fail. That is why they are willing to risk everything to try to break through the maritime power plan."</p>
<h3 id="e2">The U.S. Dispatches More Warships and Aircraft to Strengthen Naval Patrol Strength <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. President continued, "The Battle of the Atlantic has now extended to the mid-Atlantic. Germany's most significant attacks are directed at the northern route through which U.S. aid to Britain passes. Germany seeks to occupy Iceland and Greenland, as these two places are stepping stones to Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, and will then invade the northern part of the United States itself, including vital industrial areas. Similarly, if the Azores and Cape Verde Islands are occupied by Germany, it will directly endanger the freedom of the Atlantic and the security of the Americas themselves. Under German control, these islands would become bases from which submarines, warships, and aircraft could launch attacks on areas off the U.S. coast and shipping in the South Atlantic, threatening the integrity and independence of the U.S. and its neighbors. The President asked the audience to think realistically when mentioning attacks, instructing us that when we speak of the word 'attack,' we must immediately think of the lightning speed of today's actions. Some people seem to think that the U.S. has not been attacked until bombs fall on New York and the streets are filled with bomb craters. They are simply closing their eyes and failing to see the fate of the countries conquered by Germany. The attack on Czechoslovakia began with the conquest of Austria. The attack on Norway and Greece began with the occupation of Albania and Bulgaria. The attack on the Suez Canal began with the occupation of Denmark and the invasion of the Balkans and North Africa. The attack on the U.S. in the future will begin with the domination of any base that threatens the security of North and South America. Anyone who knows anything about modern warfare knows that it is extremely dangerous to wait until the enemy has already seized a foothold before taking action. To prevent the enemy from seizing a foothold in the first place, the U.S. has expanded its patrols to the north and south of the Atlantic. We are now adding more warships and aircraft to strengthen the power of our Atlantic patrol fleet. It has greatly increased in the past year and is still constantly expanding. This is well known. The U.S. must be able to stop pirates on the sea, under the sea, and in the sky from approaching. The Americas must be willing to fight for the independence and integrity of the Americas as if protecting their own homes. The U.S. will provide all possible assistance to Britain and to all countries resisting the Axis powers. U.S. patrols are now helping to ensure the delivery of war materials to Britain. The safe delivery of war materials to Britain is extremely important. This can be done, must be done, and will definitely be done," (Reuters, 28th).</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt will now speak for another fifteen minutes. When the President broadcasts his speech, diplomats from Latin American countries, U.S. government officials, and three hundred specially invited guests will be present to listen. This is a special feature of the President's broadcast. In addition to English, this speech will be broadcast to the world in fifteen languages: Arabic, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Greek, Slavic, Serbian, and Croatian (Reuters, 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e3">Calling on American People to Cooperate to Protect Internal Security and Resist External Aggression <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington – The United States was placed on a wartime footing yesterday as President Roosevelt formally declared the nation to be in a state of unlimited emergency. This historic announcement, in addition to being signed by Roosevelt himself, was also signed by Secretary of State Hull. The world, which had been waiting for President Roosevelt to announce his policy, has been notified that "the United States is in a state of unlimited national emergency, and all national sea, land, and air forces, as well as civil defense, must be placed on a ready basis to deter any direct or indirect acts of aggression against the Western Hemisphere." Roosevelt's announcement was made separately during a fireside chat. The announcement stated that a continuous stream of facts is sufficient to prove that the Axis powers' goals are not limited to the nations currently at war but "include overturning the current civilized order of the entire world and attempting to rule the human race's economy with the destructive force of sea, land, and air." The announcement stated that if the United States does not pay attention, it will be in great danger. Common sense tells us that "we should exceed the military procedures of peacetime to a foundation that enables us to immediately and decisively respond to any hostile acts surrounding the Western Hemisphere and to expel foreign saboteurs from our territory and society." The announcement called on all people participating in national defense production to exert their utmost efforts for the country so that a system of government in which private enterprise can exist can be maintained." President Roosevelt also called on loyal workers and employers to "abandon petty differences and take a broad view so that the survival of a government that recognizes the rights of labor and management can be guaranteed." The President also called on national and local leaders, officials, and people's defense groups to cooperate to ensure internal security and repel external forces. He also said that every group should produce as much as possible with as little waste as possible and strive to avoid unnecessary friction. The President said, "I call on all patriotic citizens to make the needs of the nation the first premise of their thoughts and actions so that we can ultimately mobilize all our material strength, all our moral strength, and all our material resources for emergency defense" (Associated Press, 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e4">U.S. President Asks Congress to Approve Appropriations <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to approve an appropriation of $3,319,000,000 so that the Army and Navy could have more aircraft. The President's request was sent in the form of a letter to Texas Democratic Congressman and House Speaker Rayburn. The letter requested $2,790,000,000 to order Army aircraft and $529,000,000 to order Navy aircraft. Although the details are unknown, it is generally believed that the Army's request includes the purchase of thousands of heavy bombers (Taiwan Central News Agency, 28th).</p>
<p>New York - U.S. newspapers are reviewing the powers that President Roosevelt has after declaring an unlimited national emergency, believing that he can issue executive orders to take all necessary measures regarding national defense, but a declaration of war still requires the approval of Congress. His powers include: (1) Closing or confiscating radio stations; (2) Requiring priority for transporting troops and war materials; (3) Prohibiting securities transactions; (4) Instructing the Federal Reserve Banks to conduct business according to the Treasury Department's orders; (5) Prohibiting foreign exchange transactions; (6) Ordering the Coast Guard to be under the command of the fleet (already partially implemented); (7) Prohibiting ships of belligerent nations from leaving U.S. seaports; (8) Prohibiting the loading and unloading of all types of ships; (9) Confiscating goods; (10) Waiving tariffs on urgently needed goods; (11) Abolishing the eight-hour workday law; (12) Prohibiting the public from entering certain areas according to the Espionage Act; and (13) Requisitioning land necessary for military purposes. President Roosevelt has exercised his power to call up the National Guard. U.S. legal scholars do not have a clear distinction between a limited and an unlimited national emergency (Haitong News Agency, 28th).</p>
<p>Greatly Enhancing National Defense Strength</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt declared last night that an unlimited national emergency exists. This state of emergency "requires the utmost authority and strength of our nation and our country." President Roosevelt greatly praised China's war against Japan and guaranteed additional aid to the Chongqing government. He said, "I believe that China's great defense will increase in strength." This defense simultaneously prevents Hitler's plan to dominate the world. The President declared, "The urgent problems we face are men and ships." "We have never concealed that aiding Britain is in our own interests. Britain and Germany both understand this deeply."</p>
<p>War Equipment for Democracies</p>
<p>Continuing to discuss the war situation, he declared, "Britain is still strengthening its national defense." The President declared that U.S. patrols "are currently helping to ensure the transportation of necessary supplies" to Britain and said that the U.S. will take the necessary steps to transport goods. He also said that our Army and Navy experts will begin to adopt any and all further measures or combined measures that can or should be adopted. The experts will implement the necessary additional new defenses with me. The President said that the United States faces a possibility that Hitler will realize his hope of dominating the world. This domination would have been completed if not for the heroic resistance of Britain and its colonies. He said that if the Axis powers lose control of the sea, they will definitely be defeated. President Roosevelt warned in his fireside chat to the nation that "any island in the Atlantic controlled or occupied by the Nazis will harm the immediate security of parts of North and South America and the U.S. island territories, as well as the ultimate security of the U.S. mainland. The first and fundamental fact is that what is happening in the European war will become a world war to dominate the world. This is what the Nazis have been planning all along. Hitler's conquest of Europe has never been considered a great achievement. The conquest of Europe is just a step toward achieving the final goal of conquering other continents. The fact is clear to us that unless the expansion of Hitlerism is now forcefully stopped, otherwise, the Western Hemisphere will be harmed by the Nazis' weapons of destruction." President Roosevelt pointed out that the extent to which the whole country "aids democratic countries is based on our own safety and the safe civilized world in which we want to live." He firmly declared that "every ounce of value in the goods we transport will help stop the dictators outside the Western Hemisphere. Every day the dictators are stopped will give us time to build more cannons, tanks, and airplanes. In heroic resistance, our country has doubled and redoubled production and manufacturing, increasing the material of war month by month for our country, for Britain, and for China, and finally for all democracies. The supply of this equipment will never stop and will increase day by day." He then criticized the closed-door faction's proposal that the government negotiate a peace plan, "Your government knows deeply what Hitler's victory is and what conditions he will impose. The so-called negotiated peace has no conditions to discuss other than Hitler's conditions. Germany's conditions are to divide the world, plant swastikas in all vast areas, dominate other nations, and establish puppet governments. When Hitler is victorious, his guarantees to the Americas will be the same as his guarantees to Austria and Czechoslovakia. I am not speculating, but only repeating the Nazis' list of conquests. The Nazis are preparing</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e5">Roosevelt Declares a State of Emergency Exists <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, President Roosevelt, amidst the world's tense anticipation, delivered a historically significant fireside chat, pointing out the severity of the current international situation and the necessity of using patrols to ensure that necessary supplies reach Britain. He also reviewed the decisive role of sea power, declared the traditional demand for maritime freedom, and announced after the speech the existence of an unlimited national emergency, demanding that the United States' national defense, national power, and authority be strengthened to the extreme limit. Although this statement and measure are still one step away from actual participation in the war, President Roosevelt has already raised his sword at the most appropriate time.</p>
<p>This decision is the second fireside chat of Roosevelt's current term, only five months after the last one last winter, and there has been an accelerated leap in policy. In that decision, the United States only sought to assume the task of arming democracies fighting against aggression. Today, it not only takes the lead in ensuring the arrival of war materials but also clearly states that the United States will respond to the provocations of aggressors with resolute action. Compared to the fact that the United States only took military action almost two years after Germany announced unrestricted submarine warfare, the factors of time and initiative are now playing a significant role. In his speech, Roosevelt asked the audience to have a realistic understanding of the meaning of "attack" and to think about the lightning-like actions of today. This is the best explanation for the rapid evolution of his own policy. Five months ago, the U.S. authorities still had to painstakingly appeal to the public that the reason for stepping up aid to democratic nations was to prevent the United States from being affected by the war. Today, the American people can accept the announcement of an unlimited emergency in a tense and solemn manner, indicating that the shift of Roosevelt's policy to a more active one is adapting to the rapidly changing international situation on the one hand, and reflecting the general psychology of the American people on the other hand. At a minimum, the opportunity to participate in the war has matured by more than 60%. The war threat of the aggressors can no longer scare the United States away.</p>
<p>The so-called issue of maritime freedom seems to involve abstraction and principles, but it is actually a traditional demand of the United States, which was listed as the second most important of Wilson's famous Fourteen Points. At the beginning of the current war, American public opinion was clearly chaotic, unlike the current one, which has shown a very clear anti-aggression stance from the beginning. Moreover, although the diplomatic activities of the German and Austrian sides in the United States at that time were far less sophisticated and transparent than those of the British and French, they were still significantly different from the fact that there was no room for activity this time. However, it eventually strengthened the American people's hatred of Germany, so that the main reason for standing absolutely on the side of the Allied countries to fight against Germany was the various maritime issues that contributed to it. Now, the maritime struggle between Britain and Germany, one side tightening the blockade and the other side attacking merchant ships, is very similar to the previous situation. The same problem is now pushing the United States to the brink of participation in the war. Of course, there is still a considerable distance between transporting war materials to Britain and actually participating in the war. However, Germany's desperate attempt to prevent the U.S. from transporting war materials will inevitably cause more serious consequences than the attacks on the Lusitania and Sussex in the previous war. At that time, the United States would have no other way to go except to participate in the war. The reason why President Roosevelt declared the existence of a national emergency at the same time as demanding maritime freedom is a necessary preparation to seize the initiative in order to cope with the occurrence of future emergencies. Unless Germany intends to avoid further stimulating the United States, or Britain has sufficient power to subdue Germany's piracy in the Atlantic, it may be possible to delay the United States' decisive action, but that is unlikely at present. Therefore, the United States' transition from the current existence of an emergency state to participation in the war will probably not go through a very long distance.</p>
<p>In the battle on Crete Island in recent days, the Nazi army paid a heavy price but did not achieve the desired results. Even if they try their best to reinforce and seize the island in a desperate posture, they will not be able to conceal the weaknesses that have already been exposed. In the Atlantic naval battle, the British side used the Hotspur to fight the German Bismarck. Although the losses of the two ships themselves are equal, the British side only lost one-fifteenth of its main battleships, while the German side even sacrificed one-third, so naturally the German side suffered a greater blow. However, we cannot underestimate the strength of German aggression too much because of this. Even in terms of piracy in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, the recent statistics of British ships sunk are still alarmingly high, which is undoubtedly a fatal blow to Britain that the U.S. cannot ignore. Moreover, although the Nazi attempt to control the world has little hope of success, its tentacles have been extended to the west of Asia and the Atlantic, centered on the Mediterranean. If Hitler could succeed in the Eastern Mediterranean and the northwest coast of Africa, then there would be no place in the vast universe that would not feel the threat of the aggressors. This further highlights the great contribution that Britain's bitter fighting has made to the entire world. In the Pacific, due to the containment of the Chinese war, those who are preparing to respond to the Nazi offensive in the future still have to continue to hesitate and watch. President Roosevelt's praise of the Chinese and British war efforts in his speech is by no means an overstatement. In terms of curbing aggression, China and Britain certainly deserve the expanded assistance of American military supplies.</p>
<p>The entire world has been greatly shocked by Roosevelt's magnificent call and decisive measures. This is the death knell for the sin of aggression and also the milestone of the victory of democracy and justice.</p>

<p>Chinese Army Adopts Mobile Warfare Tactics</p>
<p>Luoyang: According to a dispatch from Betty Graham, a special correspondent for the United Press, Wen Chaoqi (transliteration), Deputy Chief of Staff of the Luoyang Headquarters, told the United Press reporter today that the battle in the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi has entered a new stage. All Chinese troops, including the regular army, are employing mobile warfare tactics and guerrilla strategies in the north and west of the Zhongtiao Mountains. General Hu denied the Japanese claim that seven Chinese divisions had been annihilated and another ten divisions had been cut off. Wen explained that the difficulty of transportation in the past two years has prevented the majority of the effective troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains area from receiving complete supplies. As a result, when the Japanese attacked with a force exceeding the Chinese defenders by as many as seven Japanese divisions, the Chinese army adopted guerrilla tactics. Wen also stated that Wei Lihuang would order the Communist 18th Group Army to take up battle positions. Subsequently, troops from the former Eighth Route Army began attacking on May 10, resulting in the cutting off of several Japanese transportation lines. Wen also stated that the Japanese army in northwestern Hubei Province has withdrawn from its forward positions and that there would be no major battles in southern Henan until the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River to reach the south bank. It is reported that the Japanese army is busy training paratroopers in preparation for this attack.

<p>Communist Army Assists in Wiping Out the Japanese</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang today declared that the Chinese army is currently conducting extensive guerrilla warfare against the Japanese transportation lines in North China to support the Chinese army's counteroffensive in Shanxi. The main Chinese forces are currently attacking the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Tongpu Railways and the highways of North China. The 18th Group Army (i.e., the Communist Army) is also assisting the Central Army in wiping out the Japanese. The Japanese army has urgently rushed reinforcements to Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other cities in southern Shanxi to prevent guerrilla attacks. The Communist New China Daily, to demonstrate the renewed unity of the people and the Communist army in North China, also vigorously publicized today that the Chinese army has cut off the railways controlled by the Japanese in North China. The newspaper stated that "Our troops in western Hebei and northern Shanxi have begun to move towards the Japanese garrison. The Japanese army is quite surprised by our effective cooperation. This can not only shatter the Japanese rumors of an offensive but also demonstrate the actual combat power of our Chinese army. Our Chinese army is resolutely fighting against Japan and is determined to unite as one." (28th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to reports here today, the Japanese rumors that the National Government intends to relocate to Kangding or Suichang in Xikang are completely unfounded. All government offices are currently remaining in Chongqing, and there is not even a proposal to move to other places. Regarding the Japanese bombings, it is said that Chongqing has endured hardships for three years. After extensive destruction each summer, Chongqing will rebuild the new city in the winter months. Due to the increasing number of air-raid shelters, civilian casualties during air raids have decreased year by year. This summer, except for a small number of people who were killed or injured outside of air-raid shelters, the number of casualties was extremely minimal. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>The method to swallow the Balkans is to swallow Central and South America, preparing to strangle the United States and Canada. At that time, people in the United States must compete with slave laborers elsewhere in the world for wages and the length of working hours must be designated by Hitler. The high standard of living, respect, and power of American farmers will be restored. Labor unions will become historical relics. American farmers will suffer an unprecedented calamity that cannot be protected by high tariff barriers. The Nazis will build a wall around the United States within its boundaries. The living institutions that we know now will be completely damaged, but even in this damaged state, we must pay the price of national militarization, labor, and permanent preparedness. The United States will be forced to permanently use all its resources for preparation, and the Nazi plan does not stop at occupying Europe, nor does it stop at occupying Libya, Tripoli, and coveting Egypt, the Suez, the Near East, and the Indian Ocean. Germany also has armed forces ready to occupy Spain, Portugal, take the ports of West Africa and new world outer islands such as the Azores and Green Islands. These islands are only seven hours flying distance from Brazil and control South Atlantic shipping routes. War is approaching our homes, and the ultimate goal of the Axis powers is to control the oceans, but to achieve this goal, Britain must be defeated first. The American people must not mistakenly believe that the Axis powers will not intensify their siege of the United States after defeating Britain, which is the first and most heinous villain.</p>
<p>Taking Full Risks to Control the Oceans</p>
<p>Knowing that failure to control the oceans will lead to disaster, it is necessary to take a gamble and risk everything to fight for control of the oceans. Therefore, if the war can be confined to the land, its entire organization will eventually collapse, the President continued to praise the silent people in the fallen countries who will not fail to be a powerful force in overthrowing the Nazis, and then declared that the entire history of the United States is connected to the freedom of the sea. In a brief review of past US actions to protect the freedom of the sea, he pointed out how efficient the navy was during the First World War, and in the Second World War, this issue is even more serious, because the ocean is attacked by four roads: first, new submarines, second, a large number of heavily armed raiding ships, third, bombers, and fourth, aircraft bombing merchant ships parked in ports. The President said that most of the merchant ship sinkings actually occurred within the territorial waters of the Western Hemisphere. The President continued, "The current extent to which the Nazis are sinking merchant ships is three times the rate at which Britain is replenishing them, and twice the current production of merchant ships by Britain and the United States. This is a frank fact. Our response to this disaster is to rapidly increase our shipbuilding program and secondly to help reduce losses at sea. He pointed out that the danger to the United States is increased by the presence of powerful Nazi warships in the territorial waters of the Western Hemisphere. The President stated the crisis resulting from Germany's occupation of Iceland, Greenland, the Azores and the Green Islands. He said, "These islands will become the actual springboard for attacking the security and independence of Brazil and its neighboring republics." President Roosevelt reaffirmed that "The United States is now gathering manpower and material resources only for defense and repelling attacks. I reaffirm this statement, but when we use the word "attack," it should be done practically. This is particularly relevant to the speed of modern warfare. Some people think that if New York, San Francisco, New Orleans or Chicago are not bombed by aircraft, we cannot say that we have actually been attacked. They are blind to the lessons of the fate of every country occupied by the Nazis."</p>
<p>Resisting German Attempts with Force</p>
<p>The President elaborated on national policy, including (1) resisting Hitler's attempts to extend his power to the Western Hemisphere, if necessary, and (2) providing any possible assistance to Britain and all countries resisting Hitler or his allies by force. The President declared, "The transportation of necessary supplies to Britain is imperative. This can be done, should be done, and will be done." He pointed out that other American countries, regardless of the opposition of a small number of people in the United States, such small numbers of people who believe that we cannot unite and take action, also. The President acknowledged that the country has a small group of honest and patriotic men and women who have a passion for peace that makes them blind to international acts of violence and the need to resist at any cost. The President said that these Americans should feel guilty about the insidious support given to them by the enemies of democracy. The President again assured that the United States would maintain the social progress gained under the "New Deal" and said, "Now is not the time for capitalists to gain and preserve profits." The President warned that the United States' institutions for mediating labor disputes must be implemented early so that industrial progress can be sustained. He said that the government has decided to prevent defense production from being disrupted. President Roosevelt declared at the end of his speech, "We will not accept a world ruled by Hitler. We will not accept the world of 1920, so that Hitlerism will not be able to sprout and grow. I solemnly declare as the President of a united and determined nation, I reaffirm the principles of maritime freedom in the past. I reaffirm the unity of the republics and the Canadian Confederation, that has also guaranteed to originally support the other democracies of the world. We will fulfill this guarantee, we will decide for ourselves when, where, the security and interests of America will be threatened, and we are placing our military power in strategic position, and we will not hesitate to use military force to repel attacks, and we deeply believe in the survival of our republican institutions. Based on God's teachings, I therefore issue a public announcement tonight, declaring that an unlimited period of extreme importance, requiring the strengthening of our national defense to the utmost, has arrived. The nation looks to every individual and every group to fully assume its responsibilities, without hesitation and without selfishness, so that</p>

We deeply know that we should be grateful for the moral and material assistance provided by the American people. We believe that the U.S. President's announcement of unlimited national emergencies can not only strengthen the United States' national defense but also increase its assistance to countries fighting for self-preservation and independence. China and the United States have common goals, and the doctrines and ideals we defend are loved by every American. We can understand the importance of the U.S. President's statement that China's great defense forces are increasing. China must make a choice between freedom or slavery. We have been fighting for freedom for four years, and we will continue to fight to achieve final victory.

<p>Tokyo – Yesterday evening, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka expressed pessimism and fear regarding the future of diplomacy, hoping that a "new order" might salvage it. Matsuoka made this statement at a conference of university presidents. He said, "In the current international crisis, I deeply fear that what I have long feared is about to come to pass." He also stated, "Since I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I have feared that modern civilization will sooner or later fall into decline, because the world places too much emphasis on material aspects. This unprecedented crisis will result in one of two outcomes: either the destruction of modern civilization, leading the world to lean towards material things, or the emergence of a new world order. The Tripartite Pact established last year aims at building a new order. My recent trip to Europe was intended to strengthen my belief in this matter." Matsuoka further stated that Japanese foreign policy aims to realize the spirit of "Hakko Ichiu," which, interpreted, means "to perpetually follow the path of justice."

<p>Tokyo – Yesterday, Japanese Navy spokesperson Ide, in a nationwide radio address, stated that the American fleet, disregarding the possibility of war, is preparing to escort goods to England. He also said that they are currently preparing 200 warships and 4,000 aircraft to deal with the United States if necessary. (International News Service Urgent Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington – This matter, already seen in the statement by the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesperson that America's preparation to send ships to escort convoys in the Atlantic clearly implies participation in the war, this matter or will cause Japan to exist in words of action, but officialdom did not criticize it. The public regards this statement as another act of Japanese psychological warfare. Aside from psychological warfare, it is still doubtful whether Japan truly desires to engage in war with the United States. Japan has made great efforts recently to create a victory similar to that of defeating the Chinese army, but it has not succeeded. In this situation, to have a chance of winning against a first-rate power is highly unlikely. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese Navy Ministry spokesperson's statement will not have any impact on American policy. Japan and Germany will soon clearly understand America's stance in the current world war. At that time, the process by which Japan intends to fulfill its alliance obligations will be seen by all. According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union originally hoped that after the ratification of the Soviet-Japanese agreement, Japan would immediately withdraw its troops from Manchuria and begin its southward advance. Now, seeing that this is not the case, they are disappointed. The situation in Henan remains unchanged. Japanese forces seized a large amount of American goods in Haiphong. The State Department is still awaiting more detailed reports to decide on action regarding this matter. Officialdom will not issue any criticism before receiving detailed reports.

<p>Berlin – This afternoon, sources in charge released news stating that German forces, after fierce battles in Crete, have greatly defeated the enemy forces. The Greek Navy Commander-in-Chief of Crete has been captured. German forces are in pursuit of British and Greek troops. (Haitong Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London and Cairo military sources claim that fierce battles are raging around Maleme and Canea in Crete, and on the plains between the two cities. The Germans continue to send troops to land in Maleme, and the situation is serious. The Germans have suffered heavy losses, but they are only concerned with achieving their objectives, regardless of the losses. The question now is how long the Germans will continue to send troops and aircraft to Crete. The German troops arriving in Crete are not paratroopers, but troops transported by transport planes, landing at the Maleme airport, which is littered with wreckage. The news received here from Crete is only slightly more detailed than the official communiqués. The focus of the battle is east of Maleme. Elsewhere, German forces are still only resisting in the two ports, one of which is near Latimo, along the coast west of Canea. According to dispatches from Cairo, the number of rescued and landed crew members of the destroyers "Juno," "Greyhound," "Kelly," and "Kashmir" is now known. "Fiji": 34 officers, 500 sailors; "Kelly": 8 officers, 120 sailors; "Kashmir": 9 officers, 150 sailors; "Juno": 6 officers, 98 sailors; "Greyhound": 3 officers, 88 sailors.

<p>Berlin – After the sinking of the German Navy's mainstay battleship "Bismarck" yesterday, its strength has been reduced by half. German Fleet Commander Admiral Lütjens died on board. This is a major blow that will greatly affect the German public. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London – The Admiralty released a communiqué last night stating that aircraft of the Command had detected a German battleship and a cruiser, each sailing from Bergen. The British then made certain deployments, ordering the British ships "Norfolk" (Captain Phillips, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Wake-Walker) and "Suffolk" (Captain Ellis) to sail to the Denmark Strait to be on alert. On the evening of May 23rd, Wake-Walker suspected that the speed of the enemy ships had slowed slightly. Coastal reconnaissance aircraft also reported traces of oil on the water where the enemy ships had passed. On the evening of the 24th, the "Prince of Wales" again made contact with the enemy ships. After a brief engagement, the enemy ships immediately turned west and then south. The British ships continued to pursue. At this time, other British ships had also approached. That night, British ships and Canadian aircraft all mobilized, searching until 10:30 AM on the 26th, when the enemy ships were rediscovered. At that time, the "Bismarck" was seen by a Catalina aircraft of the Coastal Command at a location 550 miles west of Cape Finisterre. The aircraft was shot at, causing it to lose contact with the enemy ships. Half an hour later, at 11:15 AM, naval aircraft taking off from the "Ark Royal" (Captain Maund) spotted the "Bismarck" fleeing eastward alone. At this time, the "King George V" and "Rodney" had both approached the area, but had not yet sailed within engagement range of the enemy ships. Admiral Somerville then sent the destroyer "Sheffield" (Captain Larcom) to pursue the "Bismarck." In the afternoon, the "Ark Royal" dispatched a squadron of naval aircraft to attack with torpedoes, but they were unsuccessful. At about 5:30 PM, the "Sheffield" had made contact with the "Bismarck" and pursued it continuously. Within 20 minutes, the "Ark Royal" again dispatched a large squadron of naval aircraft to attack. One torpedo was seen to hit the "Bismarck" amidships, and another torpedo hit the starboard side. It was then heard that the "Bismarck" spun twice when hit by the torpedoes, and its speed decreased. At about 11:00 PM, several tribal-class destroyers led by the British ship "Cossack" (Captain Vian) also made contact with the enemy ships. Between 1:20 AM and 1:50 AM on the 27th, the "Bismarck" was again attacked with torpedoes by the British ships "Zulu" (Captain Graham), "Maori" (Captain Armstrong), and "Cossack." The "Cossack" and "Maori" each launched one torpedo. It was heard that its foretop had caught fire. An hour later, it was heard that the "Bismarck" had stopped. At that time, the ship was 400 miles west of Brest, and had been pursued by British ships for over 1,750 miles. It was then reported that the "Bismarck" moved forward again by eight miles, and could still fire accurate and fierce artillery fire. On the 27th, the "Ark Royal" again launched naval aircraft to attack, but because the visibility was poor, they were recalled. In the evening, the "Bismarck" engaged in artillery fire with the British destroyers. The "Norfolk" first engaged, and soon heavy British warships joined the battle. The details of the artillery battle at that time have not yet been received, but it is known that the "Dorsetshire" (Captain Martin) was ordered to sink the "Bismarck" with torpedoes. At 11:01 AM this morning, the "Bismarck" was finally sunk. As far as is currently known, apart from the "Hood," only the British ship "Prince of Wales" suffered minor damage, as previously mentioned.

The "German General Review" wrote an article commenting that the German ship "Bismarck" traveled far across the ocean, sinking the world-renowned battleship "Hood," establishing great meritorious service. This has shocked the world. Now, the "Bismarck" was harmed by a superior British fleet. Before the ship sank, German Fleet Commander Admiral Lütjens reported the location of the sinking to the German High Command in concise and proud words.

<h3 id="e14">The French Fleet and Colonies Will Never Be Transferred to Germany, Vichy Submits Written Guarantee to the United States, and Inquires About the Intentions of the British in Detaining French Ships <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Washington – The Vichy ambassador to the United States, Henri-Haye, submitted a note containing a firm guarantee to Under Secretary of State Welles. In this note, the French government repeatedly assured the U.S. government that it would never hand over the French navy and colonies to Germany or any other country. Henri-Haye told reporters that he had been instructed by Vichy to draft a note aimed at dispelling American misunderstandings about the scope of Franco-German cooperation. This action by the Vichy government was because Secretary of State Hull had stated last week that if Vichy wanted to prove that its regime was not controlled by pro-German elements, it should provide a written statement of the government's position. Although Henri-Haye was unwilling to disclose the full content of the note, he said that those who wanted to disrupt Franco-American relations would be disappointed to see it. Henri-Haye has inquired with the State Department about the British Navy's interception of the French ship "Winnipeg" in the Caribbean Sea within the neutral zone, saying that he wanted to know whether the British intercepted this ship to check for contraband, or whether they wanted to confiscate it.

Although the German attacks are fierce, the casualties among the military and civilians are relatively light. The elderly, weak, women, and children have retreated into the mountains in advance. Parachutes are everywhere on the slopes around Maleme and Suda Bay, looking like clusters of white flowers from a distance. The British have sent an officer to teach the Greek forces the art of repelling paratroopers. A certain officer from Crete said that the bravery of the islanders cannot be praised enough in words. The authorities did not issue weapons, but they have mostly obtained pistols and rifles, and seized portable machine guns from the soldiers. The mountain people are also cooperating closely with the British forces, searching villages and immediately reporting to the British forces when German soldiers appear, and pointing out the nearest roads to go and capture the enemy. The island's youth once formed the Cretan Division to fight in Greece, and many have died or been captured, and have not yet returned to the island. Although Suda Bay has been heavily bombed, the dockworkers are still working through the night, only resting briefly during air raids. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Hong Kong Dollar Turns Firm Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Market Conditions: The dull market slightly declined and then rose, with the British and American gold pounds ultimately rising by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market barely held steady. American gold notes fell and then recovered to the original level, with a closing price of eighteen yuan and six fen. Compared to the previous day, the Hong Kong dollar has turned firmer. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes are still abundantly supplied, and the market continues to decline. The former retreated to one yuan and nine jiao seven fen, and the latter dropped to one yuan and six jiao five fen. Economic Notes Feng Jian Bank (5) Shi Hua's Manager is Zhu Zhi, who founded the Qiu Xin Machinery Factory more than thirty years ago. Once, someone from the furnace room came to ask if a large batch of Annam silver bars was arriving, willing to purchase them if so, explaining that they contained gold. People in the bank had not heard of this, but later, silver bars did arrive. They were surprised by the source of the information. The furnace room person said that it was notified by someone "sitting as the dealer" in Annam. Each silver bar weighed ten taels and was dark in color. One bar was taken, its corner slightly filed, and nitric acid was poured on it. Where there was gold, the color was clearly different. Zhu was fond of research and also used a crucible, placing the silver bar inside and pouring nitric acid on it, but it did not melt completely after a long time. Someone told him to put it on the stove and cook it, which made it easier for the silver to combine with the acid. He tried it, and indeed it worked. However, the heat was too strong, and suddenly a vapor as beautiful as peach blossoms rose straight up. Zhu was startled and quickly removed the fire, pouring it into a glass bottle. After a long time, there was sediment at the bottom. Some said this was gold, which could be gathered on an iron sheet and forged into gold. He tried it, and although it showed a slightly reddish-purple color, it did not look like gold. However, when viewed under a microscope, it shone with golden light, which was indeed hidden within. Perhaps it was because the heat was not sufficient. He took it to the furnace room and analyzed it with a blowpipe flame, melting it into a gold pellet the size of half a soybean, which was why the furnace room competed to buy it, and he sold each bar for one tael and five qian of profit. Afterwards, a Westerner told someone that Chinese merchants were truly clever: foreigners invented nitric acid, but Chinese people use it as a gold assaying technique, which Westerners did not yet know. This is because nitric acid undergoes a chemical reaction with silver to form silver nitrate; the parts containing gold are not corroded. People in the furnace room use this point to identify whether there is gold in the silver. I have also heard that the furnace room's technology for distinguishing the quality of silver is even more ingenious than this. Even if Westerners use chemical tests, it is not better. In reality, they only rely on experience. Chinese people have scientific ideas and techniques but cannot use them, and they are unwilling to research and delve deeper. Otherwise, with the Chinese mind, combined with knowledge, the future would have unlimited potential. Later, the Ministry of Revenue opened the Ministry of Revenue Bank (the Ministry of Revenue was established and renamed the Daqing Bank). The Ministry of Commerce wanted to open a Commercial Savings Bank, and the Ministry of Posts and Communications wanted to open the Bank of Communications, as well as the establishment of local commercial banks. Originally, I wanted to talk about these. However, this article already feels lengthy, and I am afraid it cannot be fully published in a few days, which would bore readers. It is also not allowed by the newspaper's space. I will leave it for a revised edition to make a statement. This is just a brief writing about the origin of the Chinese banking industry! (End) Answering Reader Questions Since the publication of Economic Notes, it has unexpectedly gained the sympathy of readers. Many people in the writing world have reprinted it, and I have received numerous letters from readers. Because the publication is intermittent, reading it is very inconvenient. Why not publish it daily or in installments? It is also difficult to clip and save it. Both suggestions of printing it into a special book as soon as possible to encourage each other are deeply appreciated. It should be known that the creation of the notes is nothing more than using spare time to occasionally jot down what I have heard and seen in daily life for entertainment, not for publication. Its publication in this newspaper is because commercial news is too rigid. I thought of ways to adjust readers' eyesight, so I sometimes adopt various submissions, select those with similar nature and taste, and insert one or two to decorate things. The notes are just to fill the gaps. This has already been stated before. Now that I have received readers' enthusiastic hope, I will wait for the facts to allow, sort out the entire manuscript, revise it, and publish it in print to seek correction from the world and provide conversation aids. I hereby express my thoughts and apologize for not being able to reply to everyone. Securities Public Bonds Must Wait Until After the Holiday The market seems to have entered a standstill. The black market for public bonds: yesterday's market conditions turned into a standstill again. The interest of dealers has decreased. Most of them are not acting rashly due to the upcoming holiday. However, trading in the morning was still lively, while the afternoon was very quiet. The market slightly weakened, but when there was demand, it was immediately raised. Currently, only 50,000 of the Ding Zhong Lianyi were bought, which was raised from one jiao to seven jiao, indicating that the number of suppliers is gradually decreasing. Today, only half a day of trading is done, and settlements are made in the afternoon. Tomorrow is the Summer Solstice holiday. Yesterday morning, Tiansheng continued to buy Bing Zhong, Lianyi bought Ding Zhong, Hongda continued to proceed very enthusiastically, and Xiexingyuan also entered Bing Zhong. However, Shengda, Yitai, Defu, Runli, and Lianhe sold one after another. Except for Ding Zhong continuing to rise, the rest were slightly weak. Trading was sparse in the afternoon, and major players did not enter the market. Changkang Xinhua slightly bought, while Shengchang, Xinfeng, and Jiufeng slightly sold. The meeting ended in less than half an hour. As a result, except for Ding Zhong being slightly better by two jiao, the rest were slightly lower by five jiao to one to two jiao. The total transaction volume was about 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. The following is a brief table: Stock trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 23 yuan. Also, the stock market outside the Zhongye Public Firm: first fell and then rose, due to the US President's Fireside Chat not being as drastic as predicted. Steel stocks rose by five jiao to 28 yuan, 7 jiao and a half. There were few changes in the rest, and trading was normal. Yarn and Cotton There is Hope for a Turnaround in the Cotton Market The current cotton situation is firm and rising along with the yarn market. The hearts of people dealing in 42-count raw materials are very strong. It is said that the factories have not been operating for a long time. If the yarn market stabilizes, there is hope for prosperity in the cotton market. Another message: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai foreign firms: Although the yarn market has improved, the factories still have no intention to purchase. Only 200 bales of Brazilian cotton have been resold among peers in small amounts for days. However, overseas cotton markets are still strong, and current transportation is quite difficult. Therefore, everyone is bullish, and the market does not weaken due to thin trading. New York Cotton Market: Initially fell due to speculators selling, then slightly rebounded due to peers buying and short covering. As a result, the closing price was slightly down by four to five points compared to the previous day. Indian Cotton Market: Continues to stagnate. As for the prediction of today's opening market, it is expected to be slightly lower by one rupee. Limited Chips Shuang Ma Rises Straight Up The short side has to pay a premium of about three yuan per bale. The rumor of the bulls taking delivery and squeezing the shorts is confirmed. The recent yarn market has been extremely volatile, making it difficult to grasp. According to the market, a large amount of goods have been bought and taken delivery by Western merchants in Shanghai West, who are holding on to them without releasing them. Therefore, Shuang Ma factory orders are extremely scarce in the market. It is very difficult for the shorts who have sold to deliver the chips. Therefore, the factory orders that the shorts have dropped in have to pay a premium of two to three yuan per piece. One can imagine the tightness of the warehouse receipts. As a result, general floating shorts, seeing the unfavorable environment, are scrambling to cover, and the market has changed and risen in a straight line. At the same time, sales in Hong Kong have improved, and morale has been boosted. Market rumors were that everyone was shorting the previous day, but yesterday it was very different. Everyone wanted to buy. In this case, the market price will of course advance. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,440 yuan, and the low price was 1,409 yuan. Initial trading in the afternoon was at 1,442 yuan, rising to 1,445 yuan. Those who profited slightly sold, falling back to 1,436 yuan. However, new buyers were active, and covering and new buying came together, gradually rising to 1,455 yuan. The closing price fell slightly back to 1,447 yuan. The final price was 1,451 to 1,452 yuan. Shuang Ma opened in the morning, continuing the firm upward momentum of the previous day. The opening price was 1,425 yuan, rising to 1,433 yuan shortly after. However, profits were taken, and it loosened to 1,409 yuan. Subsequently, margin prices rose, and rumors that a certain party was not only not selling but also taking delivery and squeezing shorts were even more rampant. The market price rose step by step to 1,440 yuan. The closing price was flat, at 1,435 yuan. It was found that the turnover in half a day totaled 11,755 bales, of which Hong Kong dealers entered 755 bales, and peer-to-peer trading reached 11,000 bales. Piece Goods ◇ Factory Cloth: The market initially fell yesterday and then rose, and the trend has stabilized again. There are still scattered amounts of goods at the end of the month being resold. Wholesale dealers on this street are absorbing them at a low price, and transactions have slightly increased. Sales of fine cloth and twill have rebounded by five jiao per piece, coarse cloth has risen by two jiao and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth is flat. Actual sales to customers are still sluggish. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers bought over 200 pieces of twill, coarse cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth, and Southeast Asian dealers also bought over 100 pieces. Dealers on this street entered over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, grey cloth, colored cloth, and poplin. Eastern Cloth: Initially weak and then firm. The market was initially pessimistic due to the lack of prospects for actual sales, and selling pressure remained strong. Unexpectedly, Shuang Ma yarn reported gains step by step due to short squeezes. Loose shorts in the later market covered their positions in panic, pulling up prices in each round. Fine cloth from the exchange's leading brands surged by one yuan per piece. Spot leading brands rose even faster, closing at 45 yuan, 0 jiao, 7 fen, and a half. Four Gentlemen serge was one yuan, four jiao, two fen, and two li and a half. Sugar Market Sugar Prices Plunge and Slightly Rebound Yesterday's sugar market saw a trend reversal to flat after several days of excessive declines. Public association quotations: the spot price for white sugar arriving in April in groups 24 was 99 yuan, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The initial price for late May was 99 yuan, then rose to 99 yuan, 7 jiao, and then slightly loosened to 99 yuan, 2 jiao to 5 jiao, up one yuan. The initial price for June 10 was softer at 100 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 jiao, then rose to 101 yuan, 6 jiao, loosened slightly midway to 01 yuan to 007 jiao, and closed at 101 yuan, 1 jiao, up 7 jiao. Taikoo Granulated Sugar was flat, B-mark was 106 yuan, 7 jiao, up 1 jiao, H-mark X Dongzhan was 95 yuan and a half. North and South Goods Jin Cai Hao's Prices Firm and Rise Dried lily flowers have had no continuous supply recently, so although the off-season is not booming, market prices have risen instead. Only one batch of Nanzi village dried lily flowers remains, totaling fifteen packages. It was quoted yesterday, with prices far exceeding 180 yuan, more than ten yuan higher than the previous quotation. Market quotations have not been able to keep up, but there is a hint of tightness. Moreover, there is still a month before the new season, so there is a risk of shortages. Shima Longan Stable Shima Longan has had few recent arrivals. Therefore, most of the goods are small to medium-sized, and the stock in the market is suitable for the missing grade. Therefore, dealers are unwilling to loosen prices too much. Yesterday, it was heard that hundreds of boxes were quoted. Goods of pure quality were not much different from the previous quotations, while inferior goods were slightly lower. Coal Hongji Small Coal Slightly Loosens The price of Hongji No. 1 small coal was even higher than lump coal due to the lack of arrivals, and it was difficult to find. Recently, lump coal prices have loosened, and a certain foreign firm is opening up supply without restrictions, so prices have inevitably fallen slightly. Peers are discounting, at 415 yuan per ton, ex-warehouse, which is a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the peak price. Shops on this street deliver to customers at 448 yuan per ton. Metals American Tinplate is in Short Supply and Prices Rise Iron Nails Still Show No Improvement Transactions of 180-pound and 200-pound American tinplate have been driven by Tianjin dealers every day, and purchases have been huge. In addition, the circulating goods in the market are already scarce, and the search has made it even more depleted, especially 180-pound goods. It is found that the purpose of foreign dealers absorbing the goods is for use in other ports, while 200-pound goods only rely on the sales of egg factories in this street. Foreign dealers have no intention of purchasing the goods. The market price is gradually trending parallel to 280-pound goods. However, dealers are very firm because they see the shortage of spot goods in the market and the search trend is fierce. As a result, the market is unusually firm and prices are rising sharply. The current market price is 440 yuan per box for 180-pound goods and 460 yuan per box for 200-pound colored goods, a difference of only 20 yuan, which is due to the large number of people inquiring about 180-pound goods in the market. Because sales in the Nanyang Islands and other places are stagnant, local hoarders occasionally release iron nails, causing a temporary glut of circulating goods, while there are few buyers. Therefore, holders dare not raise their minds, and the market is still showing no signs of improvement. The standard base price is estimated at 160 yuan per barrel, which is not as prosperous as the previous market, but dealers' morale is weak, and the bottom line is loosening. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>

<p>China as a Free Outpost Has Won Worldwide Sympathy Currently Fulfilling the Responsibilities of a Free Outpost The United States Will Surely Provide Full Assistance The Mainland Press's Comments on America's Aid China Week The Mainland Press yesterday commented on the Aid China Week held in the United States, titling it, "China as a Free Outpost." The article stated: The Aid China Week held in the United States has concluded very successfully. During this period, parades, speeches, and other public performances were held in various places. In Washington, there were 7,000 overseas Chinese and 2,500 Americans participating in the parade. In New York City, a total of over 10,000 Chinese and American people participated. After the parade, Republican leader Wilkie and New York Governor Lehman delivered speeches. Both Men's Great Statements Advocate for Aiding China Mr. Wilkie mentioned the crisis currently facing the United States, stating, "Aggressive totalitarian countries are thinking of conquering the free nations of the world. Therefore, we should provide as much assistance as possible to China during this time of hardship. The reason is very obvious: China is our outpost." Mr. Wilkie solemnly explained the necessity of aiding China, equating the situation in the Far East with that in Europe, and stated, "Americans are determined to maintain these free outposts." Governor Lehman's speech also stated, "When freedom is threatened, the United States must prepare to defend it just as China does. China urgently needs our assistance. If we can provide as much assistance as possible, then China will surely continue to fight until the final victory." Lehman continued, "We should never forget all that the Chinese people have done for democratic freedom and other nations of the world. The Chinese people are a resolute and unyielding nation." Strengthening China's Confidence in Victory The significance and nature of the Aid China Week held in the United States is indeed a grand event. This move will not only encourage the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people but will also strengthen their belief in ultimate victory. During China's arduous struggle, only the United States can provide full assistance. The American people's support for China's cause is no less than their support for the United States. Mr. Wilkie's statement that China is a free outpost is indeed the highest compliment that a great statesman like Mr. Wilkie could give to any country. Mr. Wilkie not only made this statement to thousands of listeners but also broadcast it on the radio and in newspapers. When he made this statement to the Chinese people, it reminded the struggling Chinese people that they were serving democratic freedom with their labor and sweat, and were indeed fulfilling their outpost responsibilities. Senior Police Officer Meets with Howard to Discuss Defense After assuming office, Colonel Howard, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, visited military authorities of various countries in this city to discuss defense matters. Yesterday, Public Works Bureau General Inspector Bowen, Deputy General Inspector Smith, and Assistant Inspector-General of District B Ge Laibo visited Colonel Howard at the US Marine Corps headquarters and discussed defense arrangements, which was quite confidential. Narutoman Maru Returns to Shanghai from Yong After Quarantine, it Can Enter the Port The Narutoman Maru, newly dispatched by the Japanese merchant shipping company Dongya Shipping to run the Shanghai-Yongbo line, sailed for Yongbo on a trial run at about 9 pm on Monday evening and returned to Shanghai at dawn yesterday morning. Due to the nature of the trial voyage, there were no passengers or cargo on the round trip. After the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, the Navy Quarantine Office required the ship's crew, who came to Shanghai from the epidemic port of Ningbo, to be vaccinated against epidemics, so it was not allowed to enter the port. It is still anchored outside the port, waiting for the completion of the anti-epidemic procedures before entering the port. The official voyage is still pending the issuance of a navigation permit by the Japanese Navy authorities before it is officially implemented. American President Roosevelt's Speech American Overseas Chinese Enthusatically Support Believe this Decision Will Have Broad Impact But American Business Interests Will Not Change The English-language Greater America Evening Post stated that important American merchants in Shanghai recently met with reporters and unanimously praised President Roosevelt's decision this morning (28th) to declare the existence of an unrestricted national emergency in the United States. According to Hawkins, general manager of the Shanghai Power Company, President Roosevelt's declaration was "the right thing to do." It is still too early, and the impact has not yet been realized in the Far East, but this decision will surely have a broad impact. It was only made after facing the facts. He believes that the defense measures that the United States has already taken will therefore be further improved. A major American merchant who recently returned from the United States said that he was not surprised by President Roosevelt's decision, but he believed that after President Roosevelt made this speech, American business interests would not change. Public Works Bureau American Director Aleman said, "President Roosevelt's steps are just what we expected. The President will do what he says. I believe that what the President said has indeed won the support of American merchants in the Far East." Other foreigners in Shanghai had mixed reactions to President Roosevelt's speech. Most British overseas Chinese expressed their relief, while overseas Chinese from Axis countries tended to underestimate the importance of this decision. A certain Japanese overseas Chinese thought that President Roosevelt's speech was not as severe as expected and admitted that Japanese overseas Chinese here had previously expected President Roosevelt to make a more serious announcement. The Grain Committee May Discuss Lowering the Price Limit for Hong Kong Rice to Match the Scheduled Selling Price of Tribute Rice Three Rice Shops Not Allowed to Sell Hong Kong Rice The French Concession authorities recently announced that the Tribute Rice purchased by the Public Works Bureau will be sold at a price of 87 yuan per stone in the near future. This is an important action to lower rice prices in Shanghai. It is found that the rice price of 87 yuan per stone is the lowest selling price in Shanghai in four months, less than half of the rice price less than a month ago. Currently, the French authorities have transported a large amount of Tribute Rice and will sell it at the new price limit. It is reported that another 42,000 bags of Tribute Rice are being carried by the French ship Bernadian de Saint Pierre and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (29th). It is generally believed that since the rice purchased by the French Public Works Bureau is extremely cheap, the Public and Concessions Public Works Bureau will continue to take steps to reduce the current maximum price limit of 110 yuan per stone. A spokesman for the Public Works Bureau recently stated that the Public Concession Rice and Grain Committee may convene a meeting soon to discuss this matter. Penalties for Over Thirty Rice Shops After the arrival of the low-priced rice managed by the Public Works Bureau in Shanghai, there is no need to worry about the future of the people's food in this city. However, unscrupulous people have used this low-priced Hong Kong rice to cheat and seek profits. There have been a total of four cases that have been discovered by detectives. Yongchang Rice Shop was found to be filling low-quality rice with low-priced Hong Kong rice and was eventually deprived of its right to sell Hong Kong rice. Yuanshengxiang Rice Shop is still under investigation for inconsistencies in quality. Xintai and Yucheng Public Rice Shops filed a lawsuit in court due to adulteration. All of these are enough to warn unscrupulous merchants. According to reports from reporter Ping Mingzuo, yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm received instructions from the Public Works Bureau that more than 30 retail rice shops in the two concessions of this city have been deprived of their right to sell low-priced Hong Kong rice, and Xiangmao Foreign Firm was instructed to quickly notify Tailun and other 17 grain shops not to resell Hong Kong rice to these rice shops. As for the reason for being deprived of the right to sell Hong Kong rice, it is impossible to find out for a while. It is found that these more than 30 rice shops that have lost the right to sell Hong Kong rice include 12 in the French Concession: (1) Taishan, (2) Gongli, (3) Dadong, (4) Guanghua, (5) Dongsheng, (6) Tongshang, (7) Fuchang, (8) Dadong, (9) Yuanhe, (10) Xintai, (11) Futai Xin, (12) Xinkang. There are several in the central area of the Public Concession: (1) Yuchengtai, (2) Jinfeng, (3) Fukang, (4) Huolongxing, (5) Yudafeng, (6) Taikang. There are a total of eight in the Xinzha District and Jing'an Temple District: (1) Gongshangchang, (2) Guchangsheng, (3) Dachunghua, (4) Hegongshungong, (5) Guchangsheng, (6) Jinshengchang, (7) Wanxindong, (8) Zhaoyuanda. There is one in the Putuo District: (1) Jinyulong. There is one in the Hongkou District: (1) Tongsheng. There are several in the Huishan District: (1) Tongkang, (2) Baotai, (3) Tianfeng, (4) Daihengchang, and there is one in the Yangshupu District: (1) Dongxing. The above totals 33 rice shops. French Public Works Bureau's Low-Price Sales Policy In order to thoroughly stabilize the rice market, the French Public Works Bureau adopted the following control force methods for rice purchase and sales: (1) Anyone who purchases foreign rice from the production area of Vietnam must join the Rice Import Committee. (2) The quality and quantity of the rice purchased must be reviewed and approved by the French Concession authorities. (3) This rice must be sold to rice shops in this city for citizens to purchase. (4) Those who operate the rice of the French Public Works Bureau can obtain the following profit margins: (A) 2.5% for import shops, (B) 8% for wholesale rice shops (of which an average of 4% must be removed for losses), (C) 4% for rice shops. Therefore, although the purpose of the French Concession authorities' purchase and sale of tribute rice is also to prevent hoarding and speculation, the methods are quite different from those of the Public Concession. (1) The Public Concession authorities first purchase Hong Kong rice and transport it to Shanghai, and then sell it to rice shops. The French Concession authorities control the tribute rice ordered by rice merchants. (2) The price at which the Public Concession Hong Kong rice is sold to grain shops and rice shops is regulated. The French Concession must settle prices according to foreign exchange, with slight fluctuations, but the retail prices of rice shops are pre-regulated. (3) The foreign rice sold by the Public Concession is all one color of 40-grain Xiaowen rice. Although the French Concession authorities' tribute rice is tribute rice, the quality is determined according to the needs of the rice shops. Saigon No. 1, No. 2, and mixed broken rice are all allowed to be purchased. Foreign Firms Participating in Assisting The French Public Works Bureau originally organized the import committee by Dahu, Fushin, and Fu Jia three foreign firms to handle Chongmi. However, due to the large number of affairs, the three foreign firms were afraid that they would not be able to cope with them. Yesterday, Fuyi, Dafeng, and Jinfu and other foreign firms participated in the cooperation to assist in handling the formalities for transporting Gongmi to Shanghai. If the grain shops want to order, please contact the above-mentioned foreign firms directly. According to the reliable information, this Gongmi has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. It is necessary to wait until the amount ordered in this city is determined before sending a telegram to Saigon to start shipping it to Shanghai. A Few Rice Shops Closed Yesterday All of the 3,000 rice shop employees in the city jointly submitted a request to the rice shop owners on the 24th of this month, requesting an increase in salaries, bonuses, and improved treatment, and limited a satisfactory response within three days. Because the owners did not accept it, it caused dissatisfaction among all employees. The employees of the rice shops announced a joint strike starting yesterday, so ten rice shops closed temporarily yesterday due to the employees' strike, and posted notices at the doors of each shop stating, "This shop is temporarily closed for business." However, most of the rice shops still operated as usual yesterday. The Rice Shop Industry Association held a temporary committee meeting at the Maoyi Lane meeting place on Shanhai Road yesterday afternoon to discuss and resolve the labor disputes between the various closed rice shop owners. As of the time the reporter went to press, there was no news of a good strategy. However, according to the labor side, the requests they made this time were out of necessity. Shanghai Press Thanks Guilin Cultural Circles Decided to Uphold the Original Intention and Strive to Struggle Adhere to the Post and Not Betray the Duty of a Journalist Redouble Efforts to Strive for National Survival Guilin cultural circles and various groups held a celebration on the evening of the 25th of this month to celebrate Dagongbao's acceptance of the honorary award from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The Public Works Bureau Strictly Prohibits the Sale of Flat Flour Mixed with Low Quality and Found Inaccurate Weight from Users If there is such a Situation, you can Exchange the Full Amount Regarding the sale of low-priced flour, the Public Works Bureau contacted the Fuxin Flour Mill and the mill agreed to continue to supply 5,873 bags of low-priced flour daily from May 1st, excluding Sundays, until 300,000 bags (each bag weighing 49 pounds) were sold out, and stipulated that each user should receive flour from more than 20 flour shops on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday each week according to the amount they should receive (a total of 8,318 bags per day). On the one hand, it designated Ruiji, Yuanfeng, Tongshengchang, Dinghouji (namely Yuanfeng), and Wanfeng and Zhengfeng as six flour shops responsible for the distribution. After 35,238 bags of flour from the factory were distributed each week, the remaining 6,352 bags would be offset by one-tenth of the imported foreign flour. The situation has already been published by the Public Works Bureau. Now it is learned that users have found that the foreign flour they received is mixed with water-stained goods and has insufficient weight. They have reported this to the Public Works Bureau for review. After receiving the report, the Bureau believed that if the users' claims were true, it would be contrary to the original intention of the authorities to handle the low-priced sale of flour. In addition to ordering each flour shop to seriously sell the flour, if users find the above-mentioned situation in the future, they can refuse to accept it and exchange the full amount to avoid losses and prevent abuses. At the General Meeting of the Chapter, it was decided to send a telegram to Shanghai press colleagues to pay tribute and comfort the families of the dead colleagues. Shanghai press colleagues sent a reply telegram yesterday to express their gratitude and expressed that they would uphold their original intention and redouble their efforts, etc. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the Guilin Cultural Circles Celebration of the Dagongbao's Acceptance of the Medal Convention, your telegram has been received with respect. Dagongbao's honor of being awarded the Medal from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in the United States not only increases the status of our press circles internationally, but also lays the foundation for close cooperation between the press circles of China and the United States. Dagongbao is even more modest, declaring that it is willing to attribute this honor to its colleagues in Shanghai, and we are even more grateful to your association for its special telegram of encouragement. Although colleagues here are in a difficult situation, they adhere to their posts and strive to struggle, only seeking not to betray the duty of a journalist. From now on, we will uphold our original intention and redouble our efforts to vow to strive for national survival and maintain justice for the world. We also ask the seniors to give guidance from time to time. We look forward to it very much. We respectfully offer our sincerity and remotely wish Dagongbao's special honor, and express our respect to the arduous struggle of the national cultural circles. At the same time, on behalf of the bereaved families of Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, Pu Xubai, and Jin Huating, we express our deep gratitude to your association for its condolences. Shanghai Press Colleagues respectfully bow, (28th)"</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau's New Public Accumulation Ended Yesterday Subscriptions The Public Issuance of 6.5 Million Yuan Subscribers Exceeded 15 Million Yuan The Public Works Bureau's 6.5 million yuan debenture was publicly issued yesterday (28th), and the amount of subscriptions reached more than 15.01 million yuan, exceeding the original amount, which shows that citizens have a new and strong belief in Shanghai's future and the stability of legal tender. It is found that the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession this year on April 17 authorized the Public Works Bureau to issue 9 million yuan of public bonds, issued at 92.5% of the face value, with 2.5 million yuan retained to offset outstanding temporary loans and funds kept by the Bureau.

Major Stephen and others gave speeches to encourage the Czech community. Benes was one of the old European politicians, having entered politics during the First World War. When Masaryk served as the first President of Czechoslovakia, Benes served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then succeeded him as President. The Post Office is Recruiting Mail Carriers The Written Test Has Been Rescheduled After the physical examination of mail carriers recruited by the Postal Administration was completed on the 6th of this month, about 1,300 people passed. The Bureau originally scheduled to hold a written test in the Administration on the 25th of this month, but because of the large number of people, it was not enough to accommodate them, so it was decided to reschedule it to the 8th of next month and hold it in the auditorium of Aurora University on Lovan Road in the French Concession. The dates for the oral test and bicycle test were originally scheduled to be held at the end of next month, but it has now been decided to postpone them. Nearly Three Thousand Corpses Exposed in the Public Concession This Month According to the announcement of Pushan Villa, from the 1st to the 27th of this month, the Villa collected and buried a total of 2,842 corpses in the Public Concession, including 2,250 infant corpses and 596 adult corpses. In a prosperous city, there are so many exposed corpses that cannot be buried, which is really sighing. All Circles Move The Committee for Soliciting Donations from Citizens of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association appealed to all circles to save money on the Dragon Boat Festival to help refugees. It is learned that the Association received 500 yuan from Feng Zhengxiang, 20 yuan from Yu Xiulai, 10 yuan from Pu Qiting, and 5 yuan from Huang Zhaolong yesterday, which is very enthusiastic.

<h3 id="e19">Intense German Air Raids; Britain Admits to Losing Six Ships <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced that the British Navy's operations in the Eastern Mediterranean have prevented the enemy from landing troops by sea on Crete to date, and have heavily damaged enemy transport ships fully loaded with troops intending to reach the island. In addition to the two enemy troop transport fleets already announced as having been routed and suffering heavy losses by the British Navy, British submarines have also shelled and sunk two Greek fishing boats carrying enemy troops. Details are still awaited. Also, two enemy torpedo boats were sunk and two were damaged during combat, and some enemy aircraft were shot down by British ships. Detailed reports have not yet been received. The British Navy, operating in this limited sea area without fighter protection against attacks by large formations of enemy aircraft, has inevitably suffered losses. The Admiralty regrets to announce the loss of the following ships: the cruiser "Gloucester," the "Fiji."</p>
<p>Details of the pursuit of the German 30,000-ton battleship "Bismarck" and a German cruiser after they were reported by British reconnaissance aircraft to have departed Bergen, Norway, followed relentlessly for 1,750 miles until the British cruiser "Dorsetshire" torpedoed and dealt the final blow to the "Bismarck" 550 miles west of Cape Land's End, have been released. The entire British Home Fleet was deployed to ensure that Hitler's boasted "Bismarck" could not escape. The British battlecruisers "Hood" and "Repulse," several battleships (including two diverted from the North Atlantic convoy escort), several British ships diverted from Gibraltar and the northern seas, and cruisers, destroyers, the Naval Air Arm, and British coastal aircraft all participated in the pursuit, lasting four days from the fog-shrouded Denmark Strait to the North Atlantic, ultimately sinking the "Bismarck." According to the communiqué, the British coast reported sighting an enemy battleship and a cruiser, each travelling south at high speed, at a time when visibility in the Denmark Strait was poor and fluctuating. Initially, the British and enemy ships were only six miles apart, but then rain and snow fell intermittently, and thick fog reduced visibility to one mile. However, the "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" continued to pursue the enemy ships relentlessly throughout the night. At the same time, other British naval vessels were ordered to proceed swiftly to intercept the enemy ships for battle.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, the British ships "Rodney" (Captain Kerr, Rear Admiral Holland's flagship) and "Prince of Wales" (Captain Leach) made contact with the enemy ships and began to engage. The "Bismarck" was damaged and was seen to be on fire at one point. One shell exploded in the magazine of the "Hood" (42,100 tons), and the "Prince of Wales" was also slightly damaged. The British ships continued to pursue southwest. The enemy ships tried to escape but failed, and were persistently followed by the "Norfolk" and "Suffolk," maintaining contact. Naval torpedo and bomber aircraft (Captain Vian) launched torpedoes from a distance and were seen to hit the "Bismarck." The "Norfolk," "Suffolk," and "Prince of Wales" continued the pursuit until approximately 3 p.m. on the 25th, when they lost contact with the enemy ships due to deteriorating visibility. At that time, the enemy ships were approximately 35 nautical miles southeast of the southern tip of Greenland. Other British naval vessels immediately deployed to search, with the main force of the Home Fleet, commanded by Admiral Tovey aboard the "King George V" (Captain Patterson), speeding southwest from the northern seas. Other British ships, led by Rear Admiral Somerville aboard the "Repulse," departed from Gibraltar and sped northwest. The British ships "Rodney" (Captain Hamilton) and "Ramillies" (Captain Read), escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic, also turned back towards the enemy ships, in addition to British coastal aircraft and those stationed in Newfoundland.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Culture in Bombarded London <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>During the large-scale German air raids on London on the night of December 29th last year, unprecedented fires broke out, and the cultural sector suffered no less devastation than other industries. Famous publishing houses such as Nelson, Longmans, Blackwood, Collins, Walter Lock, Sampson Low, Hutchison, Spottiswoode, Heit Whitt, Simpkin Marshall, and other smaller bookstores were mostly completely or partially destroyed, with losses of no less than six million books.</p>
<p>However, British publishers and booksellers were not discouraged. They quickly sought new addresses, and within a few days, locations were secured, and staff returned to work as usual in the new environment. Simpkin Marshall, known as the largest distributor in the English-speaking world, suffered particularly heavy losses, with three million books destroyed, almost collapsing. Subsequently, the Publishers Association bought the entire business, thus preventing the interruption of operations.</p>
<p>The new company adopted a cooperative model, not focused on profit, and operations are managed by the Publishers Association. Four central distribution centers were established in London to distribute various books to bookstores for retail, so British publishing companies will focus on wholesale. Smith &amp; Son, which originally considered Simpkin Marshall its only major competitor in wholesale, also offered assistance in this difficult time, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>German air raids on London also affected libraries. The University College Library had a collection of 400,000 volumes, of which 100,000 were destroyed, many of which were rare German history and literature books. Later, when searching for remnants in the rubble, the first book found was "A Cultural History of Germany," which was quite intriguing.</p>
<p>In addition to finding ways to relax during air raids, reading became a form of solace in England. The library business has therefore taken on a new look.</p>
<p>For example, St. Pancras has now created a mobile library, installed in a truck carrying 2,000 books, traveling to various locations every week to allow readers to exchange books. As a result, members of the Home Guard, anti-aircraft balloon squadrons, anti-aircraft artillery units, and other units who cannot leave their posts can enjoy the convenience of reading on-site. Relief organizations such as the Red Cross have also organized book service teams, and Prime Minister Churchill's youngest daughter also participates in the service.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, major London newspapers have reduced their size by two-thirds. Newspapers now selling for one penny have been reduced from nineteen pages to four pages four days a week and six pages for the remaining three days. Newspapers costing two pennies have been reduced from twenty-two pages to ten pages.</p>
<p>Most newspapers (except for the Daily Worker and the News Chronicle) are still making money, despite the limitations on paper and circulation and the impact of expensive pulp (pulp has risen from £11/5/- per ton to £26/10/25). This is due to several factors: First, the number of readers has not decreased. The Times and the Daily Telegraph have even requested readers to register in advance with nearby newsstands, thus eliminating the problem of returned newspapers. Second, the number of internal staff has been reduced. Apart from senior staff, those over a certain age are given severance pay, thus saving expenses. Third, after the reduction in newspaper size, advertising rates have been greatly increased. Ordinary advertising space, which cost £5 per inch before the war, has now risen to between £8 and £9. Prime advertising space on the cover corners and near the reviews has also risen to between £10 and £15. The maximum size of advertising space is two columns and eleven inches, and its price is equivalent to that of a half-page advertisement before the war. One-penny newspapers have recently changed each page from seven columns to eight columns, reducing the size of each column, but the advertising fees remain the same, thus invisibly increasing advertising revenue. Fortunately, the demand for advertising space exceeds supply, allowing newspapers to profit.</p>
<p>With the reduction in staff, editors are extremely busy, sometimes even acting as tea servers. Chris Ewart of the Daily Express said it well, "I myself am a wastepaper basket. People of our generation do everything ourselves, like a pack of watchdogs."</p>
<p>Although the size of major newspapers has been reduced, the content has not diminished. All news, limited by space, is carefully edited, and editorials focus on key points, avoiding unnecessary words. After this strict control, British newspapers have become even more suitable for readers' tastes.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Grain Market: Morning Drop, Afternoon Rise in Rice Prices due to Conservation Efforts <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday saw prices initially fall and then rise, presenting a fluctuating situation. In the morning, rice shops went on strike, disrupting sales. In the International Settlement, Hong rice continued to be sold publicly. The French Municipal Council officially announced an order for 100,000 bags of mixed grade 1 and 2 broken rice, with merchants having already ordered 10,000 bags at a price of 98 yuan per 220-pound bag, with restrictions on profit margins and retail prices. This adds another layer of obstruction to market manipulation by merchants and another layer of protection for the food supply. As a result, selling pressure increased, and both spot and futures rice prices fell. Grade 1 Saigon rice fell from 122 yuan to 118 yuan, grade 2 white rice from 117 yuan to 115 yuan, small-grain rice from 117 yuan to 114 yuan, Yinghua Sze broken rice from an initial price of 111 yuan to 105-6 yuan and then to 103 yuan, small-grain rice from 140 yuan to 137.5 yuan, and grade 1 Saigon rice from 143 yuan to 141 yuan, a decrease of 4-6 yuan compared to the previous market. However, customers in rural villages believed that prices had already bottomed out, and the market announced a one-day closure for the Dragon Boat Festival, suddenly prompting widespread buying, which reversed the decline. Under the repeated manipulation of large players, prices rose steadily. By the close of the market, although prices had not yet recovered to their original levels, all rice prices, except for Min Dang rice, which had previously been popular in rural areas and maintained its leading position, had risen. Due to a lack of goods in Pudong warehouses and difficulty in transporting them, and weak sales within the Settlement, it consistently underperformed, lacking any change. As a result, high-grade rice remained at 116-17 yuan, and lower grades at 114 yuan. Other rice prices only fell by 1-2 yuan, except for small-grain rice, which was even lower than Grade 1 Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Thick and thin粳 rice varieties saw weak sales due to merchants expecting continued weakness in foreign rice prices, leading to hesitant buying in anticipation of the festival. Trading was scarce, making it difficult for the market to stabilize, and prices fell by 2-3 yuan. Thick粳 rice, such as Kunshan special fresh粳 rice, was offered at 132-3 yuan, ordinary fresh粳 rice at 130 yuan. Goods from shops: Nanhang early and late rice were offered at 134.5 yuan for fresh goods, ordinary goods at 132-3 yuan, and lower grades at 130 yuan. Original packages were not offered.</p>
<p>With the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, and other goods trending upwards, the glutinous rice market became oversupplied, leading to a price drop of 2-3 yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice was offered at 112 yuan and 110 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice at 122 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Flour Market: Sudden Rise, Sudden Fall <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The foreign flour market has returned to a volatile state. Prices of various goods have risen and fallen suddenly, fluctuating unpredictably. This is due to sluggish actual sales and abundant inventory. Holders, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately sold off. The price of Fort Brand American flour opened at 30.05 yuan and immediately fell to 29.70 yuan, a decrease of 0.80 yuan. The decline in Golden Dragon flour was lighter, initially opening at 29.20 yuan, rising briefly to 29.30 yuan, and then seeing no buyers. Therefore, subsequent trading saw mutual rejection, and both buyers and sellers became cautious. Market expansion must wait until after the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Wheat trading has been quiet for a long time. Early stocks of old wheat have already been sold off, and there is no supply. Factories are waiting for the new wheat to be launched before resuming business, so the market remains stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Finance: Foreign Exchange Weakens, then Sees Replenishment <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's posted rates. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates initially weakened but then rebounded. This was initially due to Chinese speculators dumping their holdings, followed by competition for Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, causing the futures rate for US dollars to rise to a point where settlement was possible at 5.46875 yuan before returning to 5.4375 yuan at noon. New trading in July futures saw Chinese merchants offering at 5.50 yuan, causing the British exchange rate to also harden to 3 pence 359375 before returning to 3 pence 34315, both the same as the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Also Buys</p>
<p>Since this morning, foreign telegrams showed British, American, and Indian silver prices unchanged. International exchange rates saw an increase of 0.25 in the US to British rate, with the rest unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates remained unchanged. The domestic market opened with banks selling spot British exchange at 3 pence 34375 and US dollars at 5.4375. Foreign banks were eager to supply. Chinese banks and speculators successively purchased May and June US dollars at 5.46875, indicating a weakening trend. HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged. After the balanced silver tax of 23.75% was levied, speculators dumped July US dollars at 5 yuan even, and the June rate also dropped, hardening to a point where it was difficult to sell. British dollars also weakened to 3 pence 359375. After 11:15, there was a rush to buy, and at the same time, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also came to buy June US dollars at 5.46875 and 5.4375. The market gradually rebounded. The market closed at noon with spot and June British exchange at 3 pence 3475 and US dollars at 5.4375, both the same as the previous day's closing price. Trading was quite active.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Gold Market Turns Rapidly Upward After "Fireside Chat," Returns Near 400 Yuan Threshold <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw the unofficial market turn from decline to rise, reaching near the 6,400 yuan threshold. Sentiment has turned from weakness to strength, due to the US President's "fireside chat" focusing on maintaining freedom of the seas and non-aggression, and the foreign exchange market turned from weakness to even. As a result, short sellers, in disappointment, tended to cover their positions. Since the market opened this morning, under selling pressure from securities firms such as Kangyong, Defu, and gold shops such as Chengji, and the US dollar hardened to a point where it was difficult to sell at 5.5 yuan, retail shorts aggressively pushed down. Although buyers tried their best to support, it was not enough, and the price retreated from 6,365 yuan to 6,320 yuan. It was not until after 11:15 that disappointing news arrived. Securities firms suddenly came back to buy, and Yiyuan competed to purchase, leading to rumors of short covering by Shanghai West firms. Retail shorts competed to cover, and the price rose sharply to 6,383 yuan, ultimately reversing the decline and rising 14 yuan. Total trading for the half-day was approximately 40,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday. The off-market price was around 6,385 yuan. The rollover from May to June saw sellers offering a premium to buyers, initially at 73 yuan and then at 70 yuan, slightly lower by 5 yuan. Cash trading was scarce, and prices also rose by more than a dozen yuan. Tianyuan offered public and thirty taels, with prices 360 yuan higher than futures prices. Jewelry gold initially fell by 5 yuan and then returned to even, while customs gold and other rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Futures Rise by 14 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the opening of the June futures contract this morning at 9:15, the price was 6,360 yuan per bar (10 taels), 2 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The opening saw active fluctuations. Yida sold heavily to 6,350 yuan. Tianyuan and Xinyuan strongly bought, pushing the price up to 6,365 yuan, and customs futures for June and May US dollars were also able to settle at 5.46875. As the market trend declined, securities firms such as Kangyong, Defu, Decheng, Chengji, and Yili successively sold heavily, with prices around 6,335 yuan. Buyers struggled, and retail investors supported and bought, with the minimum price being 6,320 yuan. It was not until after 11:15 that news arrived from abroad, and a wave of short covering suddenly arose. Yiyuan, Decheng, Gongda, Dafeng, Yida, Hengji, and retail investors all came to buy. The foreign exchange market turned weak, and prices gradually rose, surging 60 yuan, reaching 6,380 yuan. However, Chengji, Yida, and Xiangxingyong strongly suppressed the price, and Hengji re-emerged, pushing the price down to 6,360 yuan. Soon, Kangyong, Defu, and Mingfeng came to compete to buy, and at 11:55, the price rose to 6,383 yuan. Xinfengyong released more goods, returning the price down to 6,375 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,376 yuan, a rise of 14 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the settlement price of the June US dollar at 5.4375, this was 6,404.6 yuan, a decrease of 28.6 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 6,380 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 63 yuan in the half-day. There was no market in the afternoon. The gold shop's selling price of gold was 380 yuan higher than the unofficial futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Chickens <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Gan</p>
<p>When I was in Beiping, the painter Qi Baishi gifted me a painting of chicks, so lively and realistic. I especially loved the down on the chicks, which he rendered in light ink, so tender and caressable. I've lived with it day and night for ten years, which has made me especially fond of chicks. Now these chicks are jumping concretely on the grass in front of me, making嘤嘤 sounds, so endearing. I watch them grow every day, and I see that they know to hide in the grass or run into the house whenever an eagle flies over the roof, and a smile of full pleasure often appears on my face. Things may be small, but they all have the instinct to protect life. The power of creation is truly incredible.</p>
<p>With plenty of wild food, they grow especially fast, their feathers become abundant, and the males and females can be distinguished. Useless things in the world, though spurned by people, are able to preserve themselves; conversely, pillars of society are bound to be felled, and useful things will eventually be exploited. Alas, these chicks, as soon as the males and females can be distinguished, are at the point where their death is a foregone conclusion. And the humans who hold the power of their life and death at this time only know how to plan for themselves, placing the lives of the chicks outside of their concerns.</p>
<p>The first thing we think of at this time is the uselessness of the roosters. Grown roosters, though beautiful, are not tasty, and they cannot produce. At most, we only leave one rooster to reproduce, and the rest are arranged to be killed and eaten while their bones are still soft and their meat is tender. Stir-fried chicken is indeed a famous dish to go with wine.</p>
<p>Of the chickens we raised, four were roosters, and all were slaughtered one after another under this foreordained fate because the master had guests. Finally, only one particularly lucky rooster was left, roaming with a flock of hens in front of and behind our house. At this time, our mood changed completely. We all looked at them with a utilitarian eye. The era of the chicks in the paintings had long passed. They are no longer beautiful, they have long lost their ability to attract, they have neither artistic nor poetic appeal. Their only contribution to humanity at this time is to develop their female instinct, to produce as much as possible, to provide a constant supply under humanity's knife.</p>
<p>Every day in my spare time from class, I look at this flock of chickens in the yard and have a feeling in my heart.</p>
<p>"Look, isn't this polygamy?" One day I inadvertently said this to my wife.</p>
<p>"You men all hope for polygamy, so you pay attention to it. I never thought that chickens were also polygamous," she replied in a mocking tone.</p>
<p>"But this kind of polygamy is not a natural law, but an artificial creation. Because of this, I think that the same thing happens in humans, but that is only the ambition of a few men, not the ambition of ordinary men; and those few men themselves are not necessarily polygamous, but they hope that the men under their rule are all polygamous."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Since you are not a polygamist yourself, how do you hope that others will be polygamists?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Isn't it very simple? The facts are right in front of us, and everyone can see it clearly."</p>
<p>So I told her about the situation in totalitarian countries. I also asked her if she had forgotten the Italian story we saw in the London newspaper. It is said that once a mother brought eight children to a hotel in Rome to stay, and the hotel owner, seeing too many children, was afraid that they would disturb the other guests and refused to accommodate them. Later, when Mussolini heard about it, he ordered the hotel to be sealed. The reason was that the country was promoting childbirth and needed more men, and the hotel owner, what a clown, dared to dislike children, what a crime!</p>
<p>Now, the leaders of those totalitarian countries, because they have aggressive ambitions, need countless men to be cannon fodder, so they especially reward childbirth. Not only does the government reward mothers who have more than three sons, but also gives them subsidies. Even illegitimate children are officially recognized by the government. In short, in whatever way, as long as it can create more citizens for the country, it is good. Because in wartime, no matter how sophisticated the military equipment is, it is useless if there are not enough people. Military factories can produce in large quantities, but people must be born one by one from their mothers, and cannot be replenished temporarily. At least twenty years are needed to grow into a strong man for them to drive onto the battlefield.</p>
<p>Aggressors, seeing this, have already formed a kind of polygamy under the guise of rewarding childbirth, which is the same principle as our raising chickens. Since it rewards more sons and recognizes illegitimate children, this is naturally equivalent to promoting polygamy. And aren't the citizens produced under this reward the same as chickens? Once they grow up, they will be sent to slaughter. Writing this, I feel skeptical about the old saying that humans are the spirit of all things. (End)</p>

<p>— Ping Jing</p>
<p>I had just walked into the lane when I saw a small bowl of rice on the ground. A fat dog was desperately and gleefully chewing away. He disregarded a thin, weak cat, who just secretly watched him, not daring to come closer to enjoy the delicious rice together.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, I felt very indignant on behalf of the cat, and unbearably said, "You should share some with this poor cat!"</p>
<p>He ignored me and kept eating frantically.</p>
<p>I got angry and shouted, "You damn dog!"</p>
<p>He scorned me, emitting a cold laugh from his nostrils.</p>
<p>I was furious, "What a shameless dog, how dare you!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he raised his head and coldly replied, "You humans are the most shameless animals in the world." At the same time, he smiled at me again.</p>
<p>"Bullshit, what did you say?" I couldn't be insulted by a dog.</p>
<p>"Humph! What? Don't pretend to be deaf. I said humans are the most shameless. Look, the rich people living in high-rise buildings still hoard rice, coal, silk, hoard…"</p>
<p>I was both scared and angry, and pretended not to hear and walked away.</p>
<p>But the hateful dog still shouted loudly, "They only know how to hoard, make a fortune, and disregard the millions of common people, they…"</p>
<p>I started to speed up my pace and ran, running home. I could only hear the triumphant dog still laughing loudly.</p>
<p>"Woo, woo, woo," the factory whistle woke me up. I touched the sweat on my head, and it turned out to be a dream!</p>

<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>"I may be poor, but I have a big heart! For example, these past two weeks, I haven't been on stage once, haven't even received a single penny; but when Mei Bao was at her sickest, I still hired the most famous doctors for her, Chinese and Western medicine, changing them several times a day. And I still haven't put you in debt to anyone for it! This is my ability, you don't need to worry about me!"</p>
<p>"No wonder you don't drink or smoke. It's unfair that I owe you so much!" Autumn Begonia said, gently turning over in bed, "I originally wanted to wait for Seventh Master to collect my things and send them over, so everyone could..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Yu Kun already understood what he was going to say, and couldn't help but admit that he was right.</p>
<p>"That's right, these few days, those guys under you are probably going to cause trouble!" He slightly rolled up his sleeves, which had at least four or five holes. "Rong Kui, that kid, is the first one you can't trust! It's a good thing you don't have a wife at home to support, otherwise, he would definitely take her away!"</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia was helpless about his senior brother always joking, no matter the time or place.</p>
<p>He turned over on the pillow again, his mind racing.</p>
<p>"Second Brother, has Mei Bao fully recovered?"</p>
<p>"Of course! Just now I was helping her walk two slow laps in the courtyard!"</p>
<p>"That's good!" Autumn Begonia said with a slight smile, "Second Brother, since that's the case, please go back and take a look! Maybe it's still not too late. And I'm really worried about what happened to Seventh Master. If you go, you can find a way to see him."</p>
<p>Yu Kun didn't answer immediately, and hesitated for a long time with his head down.</p>
<p>"To be honest, I really don't want to go to the capital! Think about it, it's best to send another group of people!" (118)</p>

<p>Readers may find these monsters in the picture strange. In fact, these are not the humans from Mars mentioned in fantasy novels, nor are they the "ghosts" dancing in Tibetan temple fairs. They are personnel from the British Fleet Air Arm's ordnance factory, wearing asbestos suits that help them rescue personnel from crashed and burning aircraft, and also help extinguish fires on warships carrying aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Development of the Dionne Quintuplets' Personalities <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>The world-famous quintuplets who have appeared on the screen are now a full seven years old. Time flies so fast, and the quintuplets are completely different from what we saw on the screen back then. Here, I will briefly write about the recent personality changes of the quintuplets.</p>
<p>Among the quintuplets, Émilie is the most mischievous little girl. When Dr. Dafoe, who was in charge of guardianship, gave them five pairs of galoshes, he told them that these shoes were for wearing on rainy days. But she would think of wearing galoshes and stepping into the bathtub to take a bath. Indeed, she always comes up with all kinds of games, and even when educating them, she is the most skeptical.</p>
<p>Émilie and Marie were the smallest and weakest of the quintuplets at birth. But in terms of strength and activity, they slowly caught up with their older sisters. They have a habit of constantly paying attention to their older sisters, especially Marie, who bravely imitates her sisters' actions. But she can't ride a bicycle as fast as her older sisters, but she knows how to ride. She constantly asks questions about nature, animals, and everything else. Everything shows that she knows how to use her brain. So perhaps she will become a teacher in the future!</p>
<p>Yvonne and Annette have shown that they are very qualified to be leaders. They will act as protectors for their other sisters among the quintuplets. Yvonne has a stronger personality. Among the quintuplets, she is the easiest to make friends with visitors. And she is most confident in her own actions. People believe that in the future, in her class, people will vote for her and elect her as leader, and she may become a businesswoman.</p>
<p>Annette is the last to admit when she fails at something. But in any event, even if it is not yet successful, she will first express optimism and boast about it. Xin Ying</p>
<p>Cécile is like a surgeon, with a very beautiful carriage and a very natural attitude. She also shows great talent for music. Usually, she sings alone and dances a few steps, and as long as she hears the radio and record player playing music, she dances involuntarily. In the future, she may become a musician or inventor.</p>
<p>Currently, all the quintuplets' school education is handled by a full-time teacher, and supervised by the Ontario Board of Education. Religious education is also being promoted. They do morning and evening prayers and go to church every Sunday to worship. In short, the five girls are becoming more and more lively.</p>

<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin's new work after "Princess Bi Luo" has been decided to be a costume fantasy film "Dragon's Blood Tiger's Blood". The female lead was originally scheduled to be Wang Xichun, but because Wang refused to make costume films, it has been decided to hire Yang Yin instead.</p>
<p>The Oriental Hotel Drama Theater has decided to implement a reorganization on June 1st and has invited Zhou Chu, Zhou Qi, Lu Si, Mao Peng, etc. to serve as special directors. As for the ten famous plays that have been publicized for a long time, it has also been decided to start performing them in order from June 10th. The plays include "Midnight Song," "Living in a Dream," "Telling Lies," "The Misanthrope," "Wedding Night," "Shanghai Like This," "Tears Like Rain," "Ideal Wife," etc.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's play "Swallow Cuts Spring Sorrow", which was planned to be filmed after "Silver Spear Bandit", was not approved when the script was secretly reviewed, so Fang has decided to abandon the play and prepare to film a martial arts film. It is said that the film has been named "White Orchid".</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong, the male lead of "Silver Spear Bandit", has decided to perform "Large-Scale Magic" at the Lyceum Theatre in this city in early June for two weeks. If the box office results are good, he will continue to perform at the Great Shanghai Theatre after the autumn cools down.</p>
<p>Li Hong's new play "Where Does the Soul Return" is actually adapted from the book "The Lost Lamb" by the famous writer Yu Dafu. It is rumored that the script was written by Liu Qiong, which is a misrepresentation.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1 The First Glimpse of Gongsun's Sword Qi</p>
<p>When Xu Jinggang reached out to draw the treasured sword from his back, he couldn't help but be shocked! It turned out that only an empty scabbard remained on his back. The Crimson Phoenix treasured sword, which he cherished all his life, had suddenly disappeared! He calmed his mind and thought. When he left the Liu family, he had clearly carried the sword on his back. How could it suddenly be gone here? Could it be a ghost touching his head? He usually didn't believe in ghosts and gods, and even if there were ghosts, they wouldn't dare to tease him, Xu Jing. Perhaps someone had stolen it when he wasn't paying attention. However, he had been vigilant all the way, and no one had seen him. When did that person take the Crimson Phoenix Sword? If so, then that person's skill is not small, far above his own. But besides Wang Yongtai, no one else here is good at martial arts. Then this matter is very surprising. This Crimson Phoenix Sword is his beloved object, and it was not easy to obtain. Now it has suddenly disappeared for no reason, and it happened in an instant. How can he not investigate thoroughly in order to get the pearl back? So he left the adulterous couple in the room to find the person who stole his treasured sword. Fortunately, they were sound asleep and would not wake up until dawn. Let them enjoy a moment of pleasure. Immediately, he turned back, flew onto the roof, and looked around. Because it was a dark night and his night vision was poor, he couldn't see very clearly in the distance. It seemed that there was a black shadow flashing far ahead, and he hurriedly chased after it. He saw that the black shadow was running away as if flying. He thought to himself that there was indeed an outsider. His Crimson Phoenix Sword must have been stolen by that person, so he quickened his pace to chase. The black shadow only ran backwards, and soon reached the outer wall behind the house, and floated down. Xu Jing thought that he had escaped, how could he give up? He followed and jumped down. But when he jumped to the ground, he couldn't see the black shadow he was chasing anymore. He walked a few steps forward, the deep alley was quiet, and there was no one in sight. Occasionally, there were one or two dogs barking, as fierce as leopards. Xu Jing stood still, feeling extremely puzzled. He blamed himself for being too negligent. How could he not have felt anything when someone stole the treasured sword from his back? Isn't this the biggest joke in the world? Where did the black shadow go? It can be seen that that person's skills are several times stronger than his own. Even if he caught up with him, how could he ask him to return the treasured sword? If he was willing to return it, why would he steal it? In short, he was too unskilled, extremely ashamed. Then should he return to Weifeng Mountain? But he couldn't explain it to himself. (75)</p>

He is enthusiastic about public welfare and loves to do good deeds. He is proficient in trade (dealing in jade and jewelry), good at socializing, and likes to help the poor and weak. Therefore, he has thousands of followers and a good reputation. The 25th of this month was Mr. Gao's 40th birthday. Celebrations from all walks of life were held at the Lido Garden. I was fortunate enough to be a guest. I enjoyed famous plays and the pleasure of sight and hearing. The plays included Xiaoba Su Lian's "Magu Offering Longevity," Guo Kunquan's "Golden Knife Array," Yan Shishan's "Peach Banquet," Xiao Linghong, Liu Binkun, and Han Jinkui's "Playing Flower Drum," Li Zhonglin, Gao Xuezhao, Wang Shaolou, and Chen Xiaomu's "Iron Rooster," Xue Youling's "Female Escort," Bai Su Lian's "Flower Field Mistake," Gai Sansheng's "Sending Off the Bride," Gao Baisui's "Chasing Han Xin," Yu Jimei's (famous amateur) "Meilong Town," Sun Junqing's "Mount Dingjun," and the grand finale was the famous actor Zhao Ruquan's "Celebrating the Yellow Riding Jacket," Yan Jupeng's "Ascending to the Heavenly Altar," and Xun Huisheng's "Hongluan Joy". Every play was wonderful, and every play was the masterpiece of famous amateurs and actors. All the performers were energetic, singing and acting vigorously, so that the Lido dance floor was crowded with people. Listeners were shoulder-to-shoulder, flocking in droves, it can be called an unprecedented grand occasion. When famous artists performed, Yan Zaitang led his staff to film the movie, the lights were shining brightly, luxurious and magnificent, which added a lot of color.</p>
