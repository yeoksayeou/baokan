<p>社評</p>
<h3>基輔的淪陷</h3>
<p>蘇聯軍隊的退出基輔一無疑的，是德蘇大戰本身及世界整個局勢中一個相當重要的事件。可是，無論在軍事上，在國際形勢上。牠並沒有決定的性質。</p>
<p>從軍事方面說，德蘇大戰演成相持狀態。證明德軍整個擊潰紅軍迷夢的根本幻滅。德軍第三度大攻勢的漸漸鈍弱，表示德軍由烏克蘭一路下高加索及近東野心實現的異常艱難。而甚至列甯格勒及奧迪薩兩處爭奪的戰鬥與孤守，也都在在顯示了蘇聯士氣的高漲，守十決心的堅定。像這些在軍事上含着重大決定意義的事件。皆是當前的基輔失守所不能比擬的。再從國際政治力面說，德蘇大戰一爆發、整個世界局勢立刻面臨了一個空前重要的十字路口，而非常迅速的英。美强調援蘇，却把牠引上了一條光明的途徑。接着不久，羅斯福與邱吉爾舉行了創造歷史的海上會議，而英。美兩巨頭三天三夜。嚴重周詳，深思熟慮的談判結果，却凝成了更進一步援蘇到底的表示，這樣，算是完全確定了英·美·蘇在對抗暴力主義者大戰中的密切關聯。這是德·蘇大戰開始以來國際局勢演變的兩重決定關鍵，當然更不是現在基輔的失守所可與之相提並論的。那末，基輔失守的軍事及政治意義畢竟在那裏？主要地說起來，在軍事上，牠不過說明德軍進展與攻擊力量的依然相當强大。而還沒有到了完全耗竭的地步：在國際政治上，牠却對英·美援蘇的程度和方式供給了一個重要的試金石，爲了消滅牠們共同敵人的陰謀和幻想，英·美的援蘇舉動，勢必要更具體。更大規模地加緊起來。</p>
<p>其實純就軍事方面看，　粹指揮下戰事機構今天的依然强大，本是非常明顯，幾乎無需證明的。否則，如果牠現在就到了衰竭，有一舉而被擊潰的地步，那末。也就不成其爲對人類文明的重大威脅了。祇要德軍肯付出像這次進攻基輔的人與物的重大犧牲代價，那末，牠不獨可以佔領基輔，甚至再向前衝進。以同樣代價佔領另一些更在東南一帶的重要地區，恐怕也還是相當可能。現在要指出的，就是，像這樣的重大犧牲，德國人與物的資源絕對不能允許牠再作若干次的重演，這是一；其次，像這一類對於沒有決定戰局性質地域的，浪費資源的攻擊，到底與德國方面是否合算，也是大可懷疑的爭。至於這一回基輔失守的過程，也仍然是德國佔領明斯克等要地的老方式。大槪在對基輔猛烈攻擊的進行中，同時，德軍就另外出動了兩路大軍，一路突過蘇軍的基輔左翼，渡過尼泊河，先行佔領波爾托瓦；另一路由科美爾一帶出動，向蘇軍右翼包抄，這樣，牠就對基輔區的蘇軍，展開了一個局部的鉗形運動打算將集中在這一帶的五十萬蘇軍。一舉而包圍擊潰。這時候，假如蘇軍決定固守的話。牠當然可以依照列甯格勒與奧迪薩的方式，使德軍無法達到佔領的目的。祇要一看蘇軍退出時對基輔破壞的普遍與澈底，則牠這一次退出的純爲主動，實在是非常明顯的。一方面，因爲基輔區本身的重要性，絕對比不上列甯格勒與奧迪薩；另一面，在地理條件上，牠完全是一個內陸性質　缺乏上述兩地那樣良好的港口，因而舉行固守的困難　當然也大大增加了起來。所以總結起來。蘇聯的退出基輔，對於牠的軍事威信及整個戰局的形勢、皆沒有什麼重大的影響，唯一値得注意的損失，大槪是在於經濟及工業方面。</p>
<p>比較重要的，還是基輔失守對於國際政治的意義。在積極方面，牠給予英·美援蘇的進行，以一個非常重大的刺激；而在消極方面，却提高了暴力者的幻想，使英·美·蘇三國都不得不加倍地警惕起來。我們把德·蘇大戰爆發以來的種種反響與表示綜合起來一看，其中最引人注目的現象之一，就是德·義當局的空前絨默。他們對蘇大戰的目標到底在那裏，除了初起時的一篇例定宣言外，一直沒有聽到更明確的闡說。因而推想起來，希特勒在開始對蘇大戰時的幻想，恐怕現在也依然懷抱着。這就是，絕不相信英·美·蘇可以合作到底，而在攻蘇的過程中，他隨時準備對英開始和平攻勢，離間英·美與蘇聯之間的關係。然後，正如邱吉爾所一再指稱過的·萬一英·美受愚而坐視的話，那末，他就會於攻下蘇聯若干地帶後，突然轉與蘇聯締結妥協，一舉而衝向近東與印度等地，從此永遠消滅英·蘇合作的機會　與東方暴力携手，而分頭完成征服的大功。現在基輔的失守，當然給予這種陰謀以一個發動的機會。尤其日本方面這兩天的輿論表示。格外來得露骨；而北進空氣的鼓動，當然也是其中的一部份。德·義·日最嫉視的，是蘇聯的陸空軍，而尤其恐懼英·美·蘇三國的合作。他們當前眞實目標是孤立蘇聯及進攻英·美等國利益，而手段則是反蘇與反共，這是好些年來一貫的，國際政治上的迂迴戰術。</p>
<p>總之，正義陣綫方面爲了確保勝利，今天最重要的，還是自身的完全加强合作。莫斯科三强會議舉行及美·日談判停頓兩舉動，已經足夠抵銷基輔失守的不利影響而有餘了。</p>

<p>印度棉市、先因國外棉市和空及多頭了結而跌、後雖因同業買進略漲、最後市况再因散戶吐出而跌、結果收盤價格各跌四五羅比小等、</p>
<p>又預　今日開盤市况繼續看小　　七五　比、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日　現棉情況尙屬熱鬧、定貨交易又因運輸問題、發生影響、而見平淡、預料因上海地位頗形複雜、同時申請所費手續頗煩、直接訂購外棉、得之非易焉、</p>
<h3>金融　期現金市　意興闌珊</h3>
<p>咋日金市烚赤、十月期貨了結交易四百餘兩、市價起落更狹、僅二元高低、在六千八百九十一二元間、當日高低亦祇、一元、現金起伏亦轉小、晨由祥和出鑫源廿兩、爲九千元、即做低五元、俄見祥興永買進、立升廿元、計進德孚廿兩、成記上兩、爲九千〇廿元、祥和來售予明豐五十兩、永成十兩、合盛十兩、略退至九千〇十元、叉出天元·合盛各十兩、爲九千〇廿元、祥興永進天元十兩、升至九千〇卅元、見義豐進金號四十兩、爲九千〇廿五元、後祥和出鑫源卅兩、德成·德孚各廿兩、午收爲九千元、下午祥興永進祥和四十兩、合盛十兩、價已升至九千〇廿元、後　有成交、價比上日軋升十五元、當日有卅元高低、成交三百數十兩、金號本牌金、門市售價九千〇五十元、收進比售出低二百元、飾金未更、仍九百廿元、</p>

<p>十月期烚赤晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市、天元首出慶泰永十兩、價六千八百九十二元、計開低一元、後少成交、直至正午天元又出聚豐永廿兩、正午收市六千八百九十五元、下午天元出新鹽豐永廿兩、開市爲六千八百九十元、後慶泰永買進、故收市六千八百九十一元、比上日價降二元、當日高低亦差二元、</p>
<p>飾金兌價不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛九百廿元、（收進减五十元）云、</p>

<h3>證劵　市塲呆滯</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市交易極爲稀少、上落亦極爲微末、多空互相觀望、各有期待、變化尙在其後、惟近日木埠事宜、頗感棘手、且觀其後、昨市上午開盤、丙種微好一角、在震康怡泰信孚仁豐等買進中、丙種曾高至二元一角、繼以聯和中孚生大賣出爲多、稍稍抑制、午後交易更淸、丁戊兩種始終無人顧問、是以下午竟未有成交、丙種微疲、永昌怡泰仁豐等稍有買進、同康信昌鑫豐及和豐均係賣出、但無多大成交、市價結果、甲丁丙種微小五分一角、餘則均好起一角至三角不等、成交數全日不過七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中法藥房新股一千股、價為二十四元半、</p>
<p>衆業股市尙活潑、成交額較過去爲少、晨初開盤價幾與前收同、嗣又現動盪之象、下午市况稍見穩定、收盤潛勢亦佳、橡皮股成交極稀、價隨實業股同進退、</p>
<p>英商中國國際信託投資有限公司定於十月十日分派中期股息、每股國幣十五元、</p>
<p>倫敦廿二日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英國各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>糧食　機會主議使　米商揚眉　新囤皮球並作</h3>
<p>昨洋米雖呈盤旋局勢、然以人心向上、有謂基輔失陷、將使機會主義之野心者、北窺南進作一番活動、米商得此消息、不獨皮球幫掀風作浪、業內外大戶客囤亦擬趁此國際時局不靖之際、米市尙未脫離平檔之時、小絞前晚雖有一百十一元之暗盤喊聲、而市上却無正式成交、乃咋晨開價、立即跳到一百十二元、外棧則抵百十一元、其他各貨相隨見昂、惟不若小絞活絡、價增亦較遜一籌、此後因獲利浮散等戶頗多乘高出籠、而本鄉實銷、更以價高棘手、一動轉懈、形呈出多進少、迄中市、銀行棧小紋復至原盤、開百〇九元、外棧百〇八元半、至此進出互見、一路平穩、直迨收市之際、突有大戶乘廉出手、及浮散等戶繼之紛起吸收、市形始又吿緊、各價再度激昂、結果收盤行情銀行棧小絞爲百十元、外棧百〇九元半、他如一號西貢高貨爲百廿二元、大市百廿元、中關百十七八元、二號百十二元、次百十元、二號暹邏百〇八九元、中關百〇六元半、百〇六元、敏黨碾頭貨百十八元、原自中關百十二元、碎尖高自八十四五元、次至八十二三元、統計比上日繼漲一二元不等、</p>
<p>英華司交易更旺、現小紋一百卅二元、路小絞自一百卅六元半、一百卅七元、一百卅八元不等、二號暹邏現一百廿七元、碎米九十三元、均比前市加起一二元、午後雖無正式交易、然以人心望好、貨方居奇、喊價又復報緊、全日成交亦見加多、現米二萬五千包、而英華司則有二千噸以上、叉聞苞米有供酒精廠製造糖蜜之用云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、其南巷早破自前朝一度猛甩後、昨則引起本鄉店胃乘廉活動、雖來源續旺、市面轉定、計開百四十九元二角次至百四十七元、無錫厚破前旣數朝乏貨、茲乃一旦應市、鮮佾非凡、但見作客爭先恐後、不惜價高競取、於是貨主遂居奇猛喊、售開竟達百五十五六元、浦東新粳忽以到貨中斷、人心轉慌、羣起添備一時供不應求、市色挺秀、售價頓亦回高一二元、開百五十三元半、次百五十二元、</p>
<p>糯米在洋米繼漲聲中、步武後塵、並續見秀價增元砠、開香港特元百卅五六元、大市高自百卅四元、次百卅元、糯茶百十七八元、</p>
<h3>洋粉實銷零星</h3>
<p>洋粉昨日本客零星實消、依然活潑如故、惟業外大戶移神油米投機、買興略見懈退、而一般已經獲之浮散皮球、頗有趁機吐出、故漲風已挫、市面轉形平站之象、全日交易亦减到萬包以內、行情雖中市一度升降、而結果仍與前晚相似、計砲臺三十三元至二十三元一角、金龍西棧三十一元二三角、東棧三十一元八角至三十二元、小麥廠方進價迄未變改、惟昨以天雨各路途運見阻、到源更稀、執有手貨者亦圖趁機扳俏也、</p>
<h3>油市　油儈重施操縱　期油抬高七八元</h3>
<p>昨日食油投機買風頗爲興盛、蓋以一般油儈故態復萌、又欲重施操縱市面、無稽謠言百出、惑動人心、大事拉抬、期貨行情頓被抬升七八元、甫平之生豆油亦吿由疲轉昂、然查實銷仍屬淸閒、來源則絡繹於途、新到又有四百桶、大連油亦有萬桶在接洽中、瞻望前途、設若當局不將買空賣空式之期貨交易禁止、市面勢必復被搗亂無疑、統市做開靑島生油二百桶、大有廠淸油期貨達一萬多擔、日華廠菜油五千桶左右、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球劃一廠盤</h3>
<p>煤球廠盤、前週因同業競爭、暗盤曾一度下跌、近日已雙方妥協、劃一廠盤、明暗市已趨一致、義泰興南洋國華等大廠貨同業自車棧單、每噸三百二十元、送到另加車力、本街門莊則參差不一、每擔目十六元六角至十七元二角、高低相去六角之多、</p>
<h3>進出口　雜糧棉布運港厦</h3>
<p>今日出口貨物、運往厦門、計有豆子三百五十包、豆餅一千張、另有疋頭三十二件、運往香港、計有疋頭三百八十五件、茶葉九十九件、</p>
<h3>軟木櫧（二）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>軟木櫧每次能供給的軟木量，要看樹身的粗細而定：大概從一公斤起，到一百九十公斤，最多到二百公斤止。按每公畝可栽租軟木櫧樹一千棵計算：但伊比利半島上就有這種森林面積達六十萬公畝！其中大半數屬於葡萄牙，而且生產量極高，人也可以想見它的利息是多麽豐厚了。至阿爾日利亞和突尼斯二地方，雖說也有差不多五十萬公畝的林地面積，然而這種　業的開發是比較後起的，人也了草從事而小大注意，况說還有一種定期的火災來大肆破壞，所以它的軟木出產量是微小的可憐哩！</p>
<p>人把採取下來的軟木板片，大小不整的裝成包，運到裝木塞的工廠裏；再把這些板片堆集在露天地裏，凹面向下，壓上重大的石塊，一直陳列好幾個月的工夫，然後施以揀選的手續，除去窳敗的部分，按品質分門別類起來；以後就該放在關　堅嚴的大蒸氣鍋裏，還是用重物壓着，施以蒸煮的手　了，這種手續爲的叫軟木板片平直是必不可少的。後來人把這蒸煮過的板片放在空氣流通的敞棚裏，再晾上五六個月的工夫，再蒸煮一次，那種軟木就更柔軟，容易加以削琢的功夫了。</p>
<p>蒸製好了的軟木板片，是按照着厚度，伸縮性，脈紋的細度，和顏色等而分開的：看人是要做那種木　，或鞋底與其他種種物品，　因材施宜的。譬如製木塞時，人就把板片由大塊分成小塊，用特製的機器，或者由工人用極鋒利的薄刀把它剝削而成。用機器工作快，棄材多；用人手成效遲，廢物少：所幸現在就是製木塞等剩下來的殘餘巾有很好的用途，所以也不怕機器的多糟蹋柬西了。</p>
<p>剝削完畢的木塞，在應市以前，還要受番薰蒸的手續：就是把木塞盛在用鐵　作底的抽屜中，外面封閉　嚴，在下邊焚燒硫磺，這種薰蒸的目的，是要把存在於軟木細胞或隙孔中的有機胞子加以殲滅：因爲這種東西　某種環境之下，就能產生黴菌，對於瓶中所藏的飲料是非常有害的，一個好木塞的條件，應該是組綫均勻劃一的，乾燥的，有伸縮性的，和沒有毛病的。　平常的用度或普通的飲　，次一等的木塞也就可以將就過去了；可是爲保藏上等的名酒，特別爲能够起沫的美酒，却非上七選不可：因爲只有最優良的木塞，纔不致　氣或改變酒的味道。　（未完）</p>

<h3>十四家友邦銀行　確已停止黑匯　絕對未接受新戶交易　惟遠期客戶尙待軋清</h3>

<h3>希望與策勵（二）　寫在工商組助學金後　第四十六號申請人撰</h3>
<p>感想</p>
<p>在上述統計的數字中，很明顯的現出許多難以想像的事跡：</p>
<p>第一『孤島從業員求知的熱狂」，尤其是店員學徒，幾佔全數之三分之二（當然我們暫不能以全市店員學徒的總數來比）。從這個中間，十分明白的吿訴社會人士，今日店員學徒處境之堅苦，及求知的渴切，也是啓示了我們唯有一個勞苦者，才覺得切身的苦楚，才能奮起求智，以應改造社會之責任。</p>
<p>第二「把握了當前的時代」，時代是不同了，我們的大門已洞開，國粹固須保存與發揚，然西洋之科學及技能也不能不多多的接受，以備締造新中國之用。同時上海是通商的大埠，與外人貿易，缺不了語言作媒介，所以選修工業與英文者特多。再因今日商業機構之繁複，舊的帳務的刷新，新的營業方法之樹立，因之專修商科者有百分之二十。這許多正是反映今日激盪及繁雜的社會，與明日社會的動向。也能看出上海覺性靑年都能把握時代的信心，努力於本位求光明。</p>
<p>第三「高瞻遠謀的行號經理」我知道舊式商店之習俗，</p>
<p>個學徒或夥計，晚上不能有多餘的時間來讀書的。然道次却有無數學從，夥計，得到當局的允准，來完成讀書的志願。我相信在申請人中間對各該行號公司的經理，所給予的方便，一定表示深切的感謝。</p>
<p>第四「濁土上的奇葩」，在核准名單上十二個是失業，三個是工役，二個是舞廳的職工。我對這十七位得助者，不願多說話，然使我最感動，最佩服，因爲他們沒有想到自己的低卑，或是一被棄者，他們有自信，能抬起頭來向人羣中努力。我是要向他們學習。</p>
<p>末了一點，嚴格的說，應該是一個遺憾，就是未能眞止普及到每一角落，猶似新新公司申請者四十餘人，而永安先施在職員的數量上，不比新新少，但申請求學者反少。餘如烟兌業雜貨號也極少發見。不過這些決不能說某一部份店員的腐化或不思上進；我相信他們本來是極欲申請，而格於同事之譏諷，或自己不必要自尊與過慮，以致萎縮而退，希望第二次舉辦時，幸勿坐失良機</p>
<p>希望</p>
<p>希望於各補習學校者：戰後上海，人口驟增，造成無數乘機而起「頗爲便利」之補習學校。學校林立，固屬喜象，然旣有人譽校爲「店」的時候，我們一羣不得不向辦校當局與敎師呼籲，今後必嚴爲管敎，乘此時機竭圖改善，革除過去補校隨便兒戲的態度，（如果眞有的話），淸掃社會人士不良的「店」的觀念，此諒爲辦校先生所樂於接受的。</p>
<p>希望於助金委員會者：我個人苛求諸位，希望今後由諸委員隨時督促，鼓勵，與考查得助員生求學情形，務使不浪費諸捐輸者的一角一分。固然，此項工作是比申請時審查等更爲鉅大，但不妨由得助之員生中，擇有服務能力者担任。如此，一方面工作求學，一方面又開始社會服務之鍛鍊。未知諸公認爲如何？</p>
<p>希望於各公司商行當局者：在此核准名單中，反映出許多店員，都是優秀的，他們有上進心，肯努力，他們願忠於職守，爲服務的商行盡職。像這種人員，是一個商行未來發展之不可多得的人才，是建築一行號穩固基礎的柱石。他們出身苦，知道一切創業的艱鉅，他們實務做得多，最了解行內一切脈絡。因此，對此單員生加以倍植，我相信將來對公司的幫助，比任何效力都大。所以我誠懇希望各公司商號當局，每年樽節一些別的費用，移作「仝人敎育金」。如此，不必再去叨擾社會人士，又免剝去較小行號店員讀書的機會，助人利己，一舉二得。質諸賢明經理，以爲如何？</p>
<p>希望於職業敎育及諸學者：從業員求學是忙中偷閒，他們極希望尋求一最短的路綫，獲到最高的目的」。至少他們不願走寃枉路。所以我希望賢明的學者，隨時在報端或舉行公開講座，發表各科修學方法的要旨及讀書的基本態度。其他如人生的正確觀念之灌輸。工商從業員已由申報及其讀者在深水中挽起，然前路遙長，其步伐尙有待先進的先生們予以提携與指導。</p>

<h3>為電車售票揩油命案　我們的平凡期望</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>十日以來，我們接到讀者為項東川君被電車賣票推跌致死　案，請為主持公道的文字，不下六七百件。我們同情讀者的熱情，敬佩讀者的正義感，我們抑制我們的刺激，我們再三冷靜頭腦，蘄求理智公平的判斷。到今天，我們讀了法院審判本案的新聞，再也不能忍住我們所要說的話。過去我們的少說話，所期待的是不欲以文字情感來可能的影響法律裁判。現在捕房律師已請將王萬祥從嚴法辦，可謂與我們所要說的話，是相同的。我們尊重法律，確信法律對於這件慘案，決不會有負社會人士的一致熱望。因此對於王萬祥應得之罪，只要靜待法院判決，仍不願在此多所論列。</p>
<p>現在所要說的：乃是爲了根絕賣揩油，社會人士對於電車公司的協作，所盡的力量，是超過了電車公司本身整飭風紀的力量，項東川君就是一個小容疑問的代表，項君也就是　個不居名義不支薪水的公司義務公正的查票員，遭此橫禍，公司方面應如何以答謝他的道德行爲，這是公司的事，也是我們需要知道的。至於公司皇皇布吿，促請乘客「付值與票價是否相同」「隨時報吿公司」的話，乘客爲了公司利益，也爲了公衆利益，對於賣票員的不正當行爲，加以糾正，糾正無效，而至於發揚正義的抗爭，乃竟被推跌致死，社會信任公司，愛護公司，公司應如何以謝社會，以謝乘客，這不是人道問題，而是公司應該勇於負責的問題。</p>
<p>本案既有許申金被推同時跌下之證人，忽又來一僞證嫌疑嚴　發，事跡昭然，我們不欲詞費，可是如果法院偵查明確，嚴　發竟屬僞證，則其忍心害理天良何在。嚴德發自有其應得之罪，而教唆嚴德發僞證者，自亦不容逍遙法外，這是我們又一點的希望。</p>
<p>我們最大的希望，不是鳴不平，不是僅為死者伸冤，我們盼望王萬祥安心法律的判決，來吿訴後之來者，警覺，感悟。王萬祥是代替了揩油者受社會抨擊受法律制裁，果能因這次慘案，此後能廓清揩油，那末王萬祥雖為了自己受罪，也爲一部分揩油的賣票員做了救拔的工作，他年罪刑期滿，我們也可以說王萬祥為揩油而肅清了多少年不能肅清的揩油之風，豈不一人獲罪，大衆蒙利。</p>
<p>一個小孩失足墮水，其他小孩粉粉再也不敢走到河邊，小孩如此，成年可知，我們希望如此，如此希望！</p>
<p>在這裏，特闢「生活圈裏」一欄。凡一切人等，不論屬於各生活領域，各職業部門的，都歡迎賜稿。生活經騐，切身感受，一一抒寫，大可作大家的借鑑。題材必須現實，「寫你所深知者」；行文總以積極而富有建設性者爲佳。不滿於現狀而祇諾諾連聲的固然不行，吃一行怨一行抱「王小二過年」主義者也是要不得的。每篇字數應在四五百字左右，請以「我的職業生活」為總題目。</p>
<p>生活圈裡</p>
<h3>紗廠生活的素描</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>白雪公主空城計花紅蘋果糖山楂</p>
<p>「了得！了得！」</p>
<p>只要我一說到我是在紗廠裏做事的，就會引起旁人異樣的羡慕來，像是這只飯碗安置在國際飯店最高層似的？</p>
<p>我想，至少我可以藉此「神氣」一下！</p>
<p>到底紗廠飯碗了得嗎？給你瞧瞧：</p>
<p>走街巡捕</p>
<p>兩條腿，是紗廠工作員的大本錢；整十二小時，從「中弄一跑到「邊弄」，「頭排」走到「四排」，難得脚是停的，一旦失了業，我們對投考巡捕一職，具有十分把握，漫說站崗，就是整天作巡街的，也綽綽有餘。</p>
<p>大交響曲</p>
<p>鐵，馬達，皮帶，合奏着大交響曲，包你的耳鼓飛上半空中，沒有耳福聆會這音樂，常會出了工塲半天，還是一句話也聽不見，而我們却勝任愉快。</p>
<p>白雪公主</p>
<p>棉絮，跟着數萬枚紗錠的腚轉而飛揚起來，整個工塲像降大雪一般，每一個工作者的髮上，衣服上，鞋子上，點綴得十分美麗，幾小時後，不是聖誕老人，便是白雪公主！</p>
<p>鮑魚之肆</p>
<p>「濕度」是織布間的性命，所以窗門是從來不收的，還得實着霧，以免紗支因乾躁而「斷頭」，漿了的紗布，再加上這潮濕的空氣，味兒够好！</p>
<p>有一次我領着一位友人參觀，進去不久，他就撫着鼻子退了出來，他是經營鹹貨生　的，我嘻問他：「鮑魚之肆其然乎？」他搖着頭笑道：「亦嘆弗如爲！」</p>
<p>唱空城計</p>
<p>大概爲了體力消耗太甚吧，紗廠工作員的飯量簡直嚇人，一吃五六碗，一點不算希奇，一般紗廠的菜餚都是「搭漿」的，那裏經得起這班狼虎朋友一掃，所以「欲免有飯無菜，惟求動作閃電」已成了飯堂座右銘，不然，就得準備羽綸上塲，大唱空城計了。</p>
<p>揩油有術</p>
<p>每一個紗廠工作員都是欠了的夜班，兩片眼皮，像鎖起來一般，於是，只好出於「揩油」，揩油者，偷着休息之謂也。</p>
<p>要想既揩油而又不妨礙工作，只好連絡宕管（女工頭），宕管喝了幾口迷湯，十分起勁，代你監督工人，比你自己還要忠心，儘你放心揩油休息便了！</p>
<p>花紅蘋果</p>
<p>多人看了紗廠飯碗眼紅，大概就是這個「紅利」作祟，不錯，這也的確成了一般紗廠職員希望的中心，每到決算期近，彼此都忙着探詢究竟　了若干？——不知吃「花紅」？還是吃「蘋果」？</p>
<p>十個月到二十個月的紅獎叫花紅，二十個月以上，就算吃蘋果——大花紅了！</p>
<p>可是，時常會花紅蘋果不到手，僅吃着一顆糖山楂（三個月）那就只好再望明年了。</p>
<p>所供句句是實，如果有人還以爲紗廠不失爲一只好飯碗，那我很願意以最低代價出頂，盍興乎來？</p>

<h3>貍案人物志</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>四　仁宗與八賢王</p>
<p>仁宗直至劉后死，方知爲非劉后所生，語之者皇叔燕王元儼也。劉皇后死於三月甲午日（是月大，應爲二十九日，月小應爲二十八日）四月初七日燕王爲仁宗言之，始知爲宸妃所生，大爲悲慟，立尊李妃爲皇太后。（其後追尊爲莊懿皇太后，劉后爲莊獻皇太后）燕王又言妃死於非命，仁宗聞之，更悲不自勝，不視朝者累日，並下詔自責。九月中，親至洪福寺祭吿，換易梓宮，見李妃玉色如生，冠服一如皇太后，蓋屍以水銀養之，故得不壞。仁宗嘆曰：人言其可信哉！蓋其時臣下在仁宗前屢　劉后之短，至是亦知有不可信，劉后之身後禮遇益加厚。</p>
<p>仁宗旣知爲李妃所生，蔡襄乃上言晏殊嘗奉詔誌宸妃慕，而不言帝爲宸妃所生晏因是貶官。晏則以劉后方臨朝，不敢斥言，謂非其罪。呂夷簡亦以爲附劉后而罷相，及後知李妃之殮，皆出於呂意，復相如初，晏殊後亦復官。</p>
<p>燕王者，即小說中之八賢，誤以爲太祖子，實則太祖諸子，早已在太宗時死亡盡，何得延至此時。王在太宗諸子中，行居八，故有八太保之稱。少奇頴，太宗以其類已，特愛之，每朝會宴集，令其侍左右，嘗曰，非年至二十，不令其出外就封，故宮中稱爲一十八太保。及眞宗即位，仍處宮中，眞至大中祥符八年四月以侍婢妃姦縱火焚簾，災及殿閣內庫（淳化閣圖書碑帖，同歸一炬），獲　，始出居駙馬石保吉第。因其處宮中久，宮中事知之特詳，（仁宗出世，燕王尙在宮中）。且生得廣顙豐頤，嚴毅不可犯，以是大小百官，宮中上下，咸崇憚之，名聞外夷，即劉后亦獨畏忌之。劉后臨朝，王即深目沉悔，閉門却絕人事，蓋自知厲尊望重，恐爲劉后所忌，故意謬語陽在，不複預朝謁。及劉后崩，仁宗親政，益加尊寵，故小說中，每遇有大事危念，必以八賢王出而解決，固亦有所本也。蓋當時燕王一語褒貶，朝野感動，如聞元昊未平，王即謂如此安用宰相爲，聞者莫不畏其言，可知其聲望之重矣。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「沒有你的事！在我身上還你一個女兒就是啦！」玉崑也眞古怪，偏不肯對他說明。「總之，打今兒起，你給我好好地睡覺，吃藥，至多再隔半個月，梅寳準可以回來了！」</p>
<p>說完道一套話，他又順便向秋海棠做了一個鬼臉。雖然日子已隔二十多年，可是他的性格竟還像當初在玉振班裏學戲的時候一樣。</p>
<p>秋海棠勉强耐着性兒，躺在坑上，祇聽他在外面的兩間屋子裏忙亂了一陣，便又搶着走了。要不是他以前曾經有過打醫院里換回梅寳的一件事，秋海棠對他沒有信心，這時候是決不敢讓他走的。</p>
<p>小狗子的兄弟大概已經也給他囑咐過了，待他一走，便提早把前門上了閂。</p>
<p>玉崑的所以不先把自己的計劃吿訴秋海棠，原也有他的苦衷；可是秋海棠在沒有明瞭他那個葫蘆裏究竟賣些什麼藥之前，心神也委實不能安定。</p>
<p>時辰鐘打過八下，樟樹屯道樣一個小村集，差不多已經完全靜止了。秋海棠和張老六兩個人，不約而同地側着耳朶，分別在左邊的臥室里，和右邊的堂屋里危坐着，用心傾聽外面街上的動靜。（二一一九）</p>

<h3>The Hua Army Clamps Down on Both Banks of the Miluo River with Success; Northern Hunan War Situation Tends Towards Stability; Japanese Troops on the Front are Forced to Retreat to the Riverbank Under Chinese Pressure; Fierce Battle Unfolds in the Area of Lulin Pool</h3>
<p>Changsha: On the 22nd, the Japanese, once again reinforcing their invasion of Lulin Pool, launched a strong attack with land, sea, and air forces. The Chinese army engaged the Japanese in a fierce and unprecedented battle. The area was lost and regained twice and is currently being firmly defended by the Chinese army. More than ten Japanese warships were also discovered retreating in defeat after sustaining damage. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese on the front of the Miluo River, after being fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese, are now being forced back to the riverbank. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Wengjiang area. The Chinese army, taking advantage of its superior terrain, continues to inflict fatal blows on the Japanese. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the war situation on the northern Hunan front seems to be stabilizing. The Japanese army is now turning eastward to defend against the flanking attacks of the Chinese army. The main threat to the Chinese army is being applied to the Japanese flanks, stationed on the north bank of the Miluo River, from the center of the three Chinese army columns advancing from the east and west. The central column has recovered Guanwang Temple, defeating the Japanese left wing. It is reported that the Japanese are currently reinforcing to counterattack in that area, and the Japanese advance on the Miluo River city bank has been halted. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese army's tactic of clamping down on both banks of the Miluo River with encirclement has proved successful. The Japanese army on the south bank of the Miluo River was fiercely attacked by the Chinese army yesterday, abandoning most of its positions in the area of Xinshi and Wukou, and retreating north across the river. The Chinese army on the north bank of the Miluo River controls the positions around Dajing Street and Changle Street, and the Japanese communication lines are in danger of being cut off by the Chinese army. Japanese cavalry landing on the east bank of Dongting Lake in the Nanyingtian and Lulin Pool area was surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, unable to advance. Since the Japanese invasion of northern Hunan, the Chinese river defense artillery in Dongting Lake, south of Lujiao, has sunk five Japanese warships. Japanese ships are also frequently being sunk or destroyed by mines. In view of the overall war situation, the Japanese army's decline has become a certainty. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: The Japanese invading Changle Street, north of the Miluo River, suffered heavy casualties after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese sent reinforcements to counterattack, but were again fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. A Japanese force that invaded Xinshi has now been lured into Shending Mountain by the Chinese and is being concentrated for attack. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military news: (1) On the north bank of the Miluo River, after the Chinese army captured Guanwang Bridge, the Japanese reinforced with about two or more regiments and launched a counterattack against the Chinese. After a concerted and fierce attack by the Chinese forces, the Japanese were completely defeated. Subsequently, the Japanese continued to send large reinforcements. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting in the area west of that place. A Japanese force of over 3,000 in the Changle Street area launched a counterattack northeast towards Langshan Bridge and was also defeated by the Chinese. Many Japanese were killed by the Chinese in the Yanglin Street area. (2) The Japanese on the riverbank south of the Miluo River were subjected to a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army on the dawn of the 20th. By 6:00 AM on the 21st, many Japanese had been killed or wounded. A portion of the Japanese in the Wusongshi area retreated to the north bank, but were held back by the Chinese. The Japanese retreating to Xinshi have indeed been surrounded by the Chinese. The Japanese in the Guiyi area are still confronting the Chinese across the river. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese troops retreating to the north bank of the Miluo River retreated eastward from Wukou and Changle Street. On the morning of the 22nd, they were surrounded by the Chinese army in Yujia Pass and are currently being concentrated for attack. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesman today gave an optimistic account of the battle in northern Hunan, but could not say for certain the purpose of this Japanese operation. He stated that the battlefield was approximately 70 kilometers wide and deep, and that the Japanese had used over 80,000 troops, over 20 warships, over 200 motorboats, and over 100 aircraft. On the morning of the 18th, they crossed the Xinqiang River and launched an offensive. Their vanguard force of over 10,000 troops crossed the Miluo River in five routes on the morning of the 20th. The Chinese army immediately rose up to meet them in battle, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The strong Chinese forces stationed between the two rivers simultaneously launched a flanking attack from east to west. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, they captured Guanwang Bridge. The Japanese troops in that area, numbering approximately 14,000, suffered heavy losses and retreated westward. As a result, a portion of the Japanese troops south of the river retreated back to the north bank, while the rest remained on the south bank, confronting the Chinese army. As of this morning, both sides are still fighting on both banks, and the Japanese casualties have reached 15,000. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: On the evening of the 21st, Japanese warships fiercely attacking Lulin Bay on the northwest opposite bank of Xiangyin attempted a full-scale forced landing. The Chinese army fought valiantly and finally repelled the Japanese. The Chinese artillery then bombarded them, and the Japanese warships suffered heavy damage. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>A Military Expert Discusses the Intense Battle in Northern Hunan</p>
<p>Chongqing: The great battle in northern Hunan, which began on the 18th of this month and continued until the 22nd, has entered a fierce stage. As a result of the Chinese army's fierce attacks over the past five days, the Japanese forces have weakened and are gradually showing signs of wavering. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a military expert on the 22nd to inquire about the Japanese army's intentions in this invasion and the latest war situation. The expert gave the following detailed explanation: The Japanese, exhausted from repeated defeats in recent battles, decided to concentrate their land, sea, and air forces to launch a large-scale invasion of northern Hunan, attempting to reverse their decline. Therefore, they first invaded Huadayun Mountain on the 7th of this month, attempting to both destroy the Chinese forward positions and cover the concentration of Japanese troops from various locations. This conspiracy was anticipated by the Chinese army, which employed a magnet warfare tactic, attracting the Japanese forces entrenched on all fronts, making them a narrow line, and then counterattacking, flanking, intercepting, or clamping down on them, turning them into several points, and then destroying them one by one. Since the dawn of the 18th, the Japanese have crossed the Xinqiang River southwards via several routes at Zhonggangkou on land, and then advanced to the banks of the Miluo River via Guanwang Temple and other places. The Chinese army briefly resisted at that time and then retreated according to strategy to predetermined areas. By sea, the Japanese attempted to land at Shangqingshan, a deeper area of Dongting Lake, but the Chinese prevented them. The Japanese attempts to land at Yanjia Mountain and Nanyingtian were not only unsuccessful, but also resulted in the sinking of many Japanese motorboats by the Chinese. After the Japanese reached the banks of the Miluo River, they crossed the river southwards on the dawn of the 20th, but were suppressed by Chinese firepower. No more than 6,000 people crossed, and they were unable to advance, suffering even greater damage. The Guiyi route was even forced to retreat. On the 21st, the strong Chinese forces left on the north bank of the Miluo River began to exert their power, launching a fierce attack on the left flank of the Japanese from Yanglin Street to Guanwang Temple before dawn. Their morale was extremely high, and the Japanese forces could not withstand the pressure. The Japanese in the Guanwang Temple area, numbering about 10,000, were completely defeated, and many corpses were left in the mountains and valleys. The Chinese army then recovered Guanwang Temple and has now reached the area near Dajing Street. The route attacking Yanglin Street has also made considerable gains. Another Chinese route attacked the rear of the Japanese entrenched in Changle Street, forcing the Japanese to shift their front and brace themselves northwards, and many Japanese were killed by the Chinese on the spot. The military expert concluded by saying that the Japanese forces are now very weak, but they still have reserve forces in the rear. Whether they will reinforce and try again, or advance north early, is up to the Japanese to decide. If they continue to neither advance nor retreat, it is expected that the Japanese troops along the Miluo River will soon be completely repelled by the Chinese. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Lakeside Artillery Sinks Japanese Warships</p>
<p>The Chinese lakeside artillery in Changde has been bombarding Japanese warships in recent days, unleashing great power. On the 19th and 20th, dozens of Japanese warships and motorboats were sunk or damaged by the Chinese in the Xiang River and Lotus Lake area. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: Japanese warships in the Dongting Lake area attempted to invade the areas near the lake shore, but were all repelled by the Chinese army. On the evening of the 21st, Japanese warships fiercely attacking Lulin Bay on the northwest opposite bank of Xiangyin twice attempted a full-scale forced landing, but the Chinese army finally repelled them. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: Several Japanese boats, along with more than ten civilian ships, carrying over a thousand Japanese soldiers, sailed towards the mouth of the Boluo River on the morning of the 22nd, attempting to land at Hejiatang. They were fiercely attacked by the Chinese, and two motorboats were sunk. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Attack on Taishan Thwarted by Chinese</p>
<p>Chongqing military news: (1) Recently, over 5,000 Japanese troops have been sent from Guangzhou to Xinhui and Jiangmen, south of Guangzhou. On the morning of the 20th, over 3,000 of them were divided into routes and acted recklessly westward from Xinhui. One route attacked Yasha Mountain, east of Daze, and another attacked Tishan, northeast of Daze, but were thwarted by the Chinese army, resulting in a stalemate. One route attempted a forced landing at Niule, southwest of Daze, but was repelled by the Chinese. At noon, the Japanese sent reinforcements to invade Daze. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese are confronting each other in the area around the Upper, Middle, and Lower Jiaofeng peaks.

<p>Hong Kong: A Macau correspondent for the China Mail announced today that the Japanese army is advancing towards Taishan, ninety miles southwest of Hong Kong, with the apparent goal of cutting off one of China's secondary lifelines, Taishan, believed to be a storage site for Chinese goods shipped from Hong Kong to the United States. The China Mail reported that the Japanese landed at Guanghai, fifty miles southwest of Macau, under the cover of warships, and advanced into the interior of Taishan County. The Chinese civilians of Taishan are currently evacuating, and the Chinese security forces and village guards are resisting the Japanese army. (23rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: Over 2,000 Japanese troops in Guangdong sailed in many warships to the Sanxia River area of Guanghai at dawn on the 20th and forcibly landed. They engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese defending troops in Doushan. In the afternoon, they reached Chonglou, attempting to advance on Taishan along the Taishan Highway. This morning, the Chinese and Japanese were still engaged in a fierce battle near Taishan. On the same day, the Japanese in Xinhui attacked westward from Huicheng along the Xinkai Road, attempting to seize Danshuikou, but were intercepted by the Chinese in the Daze School, and the Upper, Middle, and Lower Jiaofeng areas. They are still fighting. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chinese Army Shoots Down a Japanese Plane</p>

<h3>Effective Implementation of Foreign Exchange Controls; Black Market in Hong Kong Eliminated; Frozen Legal Tender Deposits in Various Banks; Prohibition of Free Trading on the Market</h3>
<p>Chongqing: An official spokesman for the Ministry of Finance announced today that the black market in Hong Kong, after the Exchange Equalization Fund and the Hong Kong government agreed to freeze all legal tender, has been completely eliminated, just like in Shanghai. It is now stipulated in Hong Kong that all legal tender cannot be withdrawn from Hong Kong banks, and checking accounts, whether in the name of private individuals, foreign firms, or banks in Shanghai, cannot be withdrawn either. (23rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Referring to the freezing of legal tender in Hong Kong, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated today that since Britain and the United States issued the freezing order, the black market in Shanghai has been eliminated under the order of the Legal Tender Stabilization Fund Committee and with the cooperation of various foreign banks. However, if Hong Kong still allows the free trading of legal tender without taking action, the black market cannot be completely eliminated. The existence of this situation is sufficient to affect the procedures established by the National Government regarding foreign exchange and the equalization of foreign exchange rates. After a recent meeting, the Foreign Exchange Control Committee of the National Government decided to submit this matter to the Legal Tender Stabilization Fund Committee for consultation with the Hong Kong government. Subsequently, the Hong Kong government agreed to freeze the legal tender deposited in various banks and prohibit free trading in the market. Now that the black markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been eliminated, foreign exchange controls can be further strengthened. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Fall of Kyiv</h3>
<p>The retreat of Soviet troops from Kyiv is undoubtedly a rather important event in both the German-Soviet war itself and the overall world situation. However, neither militarily nor in terms of the international situation does it have a decisive nature.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, the German-Soviet war has evolved into a stalemate, proving the fundamental disillusionment of the German army's dream of completely crushing the Red Army. The gradual weakening of the German army's third major offensive indicates the extreme difficulty in realizing the German army's ambitions to advance from Ukraine all the way down to the Caucasus and the Near East. Even the battles and isolated defense of Leningrad and Odessa all demonstrate the high morale of the Soviet Union and the determination to defend to the death. Events like these, which contain significant decisive military significance, cannot be compared to the current loss of Kyiv. Furthermore, from the perspective of international politics, the outbreak of the German-Soviet war immediately placed the entire world situation at an unprecedentedly important crossroads, and the very rapid British and American emphasis on aid to the Soviet Union led it onto a bright path. Shortly thereafter, Roosevelt and Churchill held a history-making sea conference, and the three-day, three-night, serious, thorough, and deliberate negotiations between the British and American giants solidified into an expression of further aid to the Soviet Union to the end. In this way, the close association of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union in the war against violent ideologies was completely determined. These are two decisive key moments in the evolution of the international situation since the beginning of the German-Soviet war, and of course, they are even less comparable to the current loss of Kyiv. So, what is the military and political significance of the loss of Kyiv after all? Primarily speaking, militarily, it only shows that the German army's progress and attack power are still quite strong and have not yet reached the point of complete exhaustion. In international politics, it provides an important touchstone for the extent and manner of British and American aid to the Soviet Union. In order to eliminate the conspiracies and fantasies of their common enemies, the British and American aid to the Soviet Union must be stepped up in a more concrete and larger scale.</p>
<p>In fact, purely from a military point of view, it is very obvious and almost doesn't need proving that the war machine under Nazi command is still powerful today. Otherwise, if it had already reached the point of exhaustion and could be crushed in one fell swoop, then it would not constitute such a major threat to human civilization. As long as the German army is willing to pay a heavy price in human and material sacrifices like in this attack on Kyiv, then it can not only occupy Kyiv, but perhaps even rush forward again and occupy some other important areas further southeast at the same price. What must be pointed out now is that the resources of the German people and materials absolutely cannot allow it to repeat such a thing several times. That's one thing. Secondly, it is highly doubtful whether this kind of attack that wastes resources on areas that do not determine the nature of the war situation is worthwhile for the German side. As for the process of this fall of Kyiv, it is still the old way of the German occupation of Minsk and other important places. Roughly, during the fierce attack on Kyiv, the German army simultaneously dispatched two other large armies. One route broke through the Soviet army's left flank in Kyiv, crossed the Dnieper River, and occupied Poltava first; the other route set out from the Komel area, encircling the Soviet army's right flank. In this way, it launched a local pincer movement against the Soviet army in the Kyiv area, intending to encircle and crush the 500,000 Soviet troops concentrated in this area in one fell swoop. At this time, if the Soviet army decided to stand firm, it could of course prevent the German army from achieving its occupation goals in the manner of Leningrad and Odessa. Just by looking at the widespread and thorough destruction of Kyiv by the Soviet army when it retreated, it is very clear that this retreat was purely proactive. On the one hand, because the importance of the Kyiv area itself is absolutely not comparable to Leningrad and Odessa; on the other hand, in terms of geographical conditions, it is completely an inland area lacking the good ports of the above two places, so the difficulty of holding out there is greatly increased. So, to sum up, the Soviet Union's retreat from Kyiv has no major impact on its military prestige or the overall war situation. The only noteworthy loss is probably in terms of economics and industry.</p>
<p>More important is the significance of the fall of Kyiv for international politics. On the positive side, it provides a very significant stimulus to the ongoing British and American aid to the Soviet Union; while on the negative side, it raises the illusions of violent elements, forcing Britain, America, and the Soviet Union to be doubly vigilant. If we look at the various reactions and expressions since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, one of the most striking phenomena is the unprecedented silence of the German and Italian authorities. They have never heard a clearer explanation of what the goal of the Soviet war is, except for an example of a statement at the beginning. Therefore, it is speculated that Hitler's fantasies at the start of the Soviet war are probably still held today. This is that he never believes that Britain, America, and the Soviet Union can cooperate to the end, and that in the process of attacking the Soviet Union, he is ready at any time to start a peace offensive against Britain, alienating the relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. Then, as Churchill has repeatedly pointed out, if Britain and America are foolish and sit idly by, then he will suddenly turn to conclude a compromise with the Soviet Union after capturing some areas of the Soviet Union, and rush to the Near East and India in one fell swoop, permanently eliminating the opportunity for British-Soviet cooperation, joining hands with Eastern violence, and completing the great task of conquest separately. The fall of Kyiv, of course, provides an opportunity to launch such a conspiracy. Especially the opinions expressed by Japan in the past two days are particularly blatant, and the agitation of the northward advance is certainly part of it. What Germany, Italy, and Japan are most jealous of is the Soviet Union's army, navy, and air force, and especially the cooperation of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. Their current true goal is to isolate the Soviet Union and attack the interests of Britain, America, and other countries, and the means are anti-Sovietism and anti-communism. This has been a consistent roundabout tactic in international politics for many years.</p>
<p>In short, in order to ensure victory, the most important thing for the side of the justice front today is to completely strengthen its own cooperation. The holding of the Moscow Three-Power Conference and the suspension of US-Japan negotiations are more than enough to offset the adverse effects of the fall of Kyiv.</p>
<h3>US President and Congressional Leaders Confer on Aid to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union; Secretary of State Hull Tells Reporters the Neutrality Act Will Be Largely Amended</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 23rd - President Roosevelt yesterday discussed with several congressional leaders the procedure for expediting the $6,000,000,000 new Lend-Lease Act, to provide additional assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt also discussed the possibility of requesting an additional $100,000,000 in defense funds to ensure the continued support for countries fighting the Axis powers. Congressional leaders predicted that the process of reviewing the new Lend-Lease would take two weeks. They also discussed the necessity of implementing price control legislation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - In an effort to expedite the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, President Roosevelt convened a meeting with congressional leaders yesterday morning after returning to Washington. Attendees included House Majority Leader McCormack, Vice President Wallace, Speaker of the House Rayburn, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee Cannon, Congressman Woodrum, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally, and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee McKellar. The President learned that the Lend-Lease Act could be passed quickly, but would require the addition of certain provisions such as defense spending. Therefore, the bill may not be submitted to the House within half a month. McCormack later told reporters that German pressure on Britain may intensify, and the President felt it was necessary to immediately expand the production of armaments under the Lend-Lease Act. Before departing for Hyde Park on Sunday, the President held a press conference and instructed reporters to prepare to attend a White House reception upon his return to the capital, demonstrating the President's emphasis on expanding the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had long wanted to express his view that the Neutrality Act should be amended, but he did not want to predict when the act might be repealed or amended. He had discussed the repeal or amendment of the act with congressional leaders to further advance aid to Britain. The Lend-Lease Act is based on self-defense and includes room for further increases when defense needs increase, Hull said. Hull also stated that when the Neutrality Act was passed, he said that the act could either keep the United States out of the war or bring the United States into the war. Merely removing the arms embargo from the Neutrality Act is not enough to open the way for aid to Britain, he said. When asked if the situation in the Soviet Union was overly pessimistic, Hull replied that based on observations of the Soviet Union's war situation, there did not seem to be any pessimism. Hull concluded by saying that diplomatic negotiations are still underway to resolve the dispute between Peru and Ecuador. Hull's comments on the Neutrality Act are seen by Washington insiders as the first salvo in a campaign to persuade Congress to repeal the Neutrality Act. This Neutrality Act currently prevents the authorities from advancing their policy of aiding various countries to jointly resist the Axis powers. If this act is repealed, the President could not only arm merchant ships but also send armed merchant ships into combat zones. The US Navy can now protect British and other foreign ships crossing the Atlantic and can fire on German warships and aircraft, but cannot protect US ships entering combat zones. Many Americans consider this situation an anachronistic absurdity, and the practice of sending US ships flying the Panamanian flag to Iceland and other places is particularly inappropriate. Hull's opinions have considerable influence in both the government and the opposition, and a movement to repeal the Neutrality Act seems to have emerged in Congress.</p>
<p>British and American Delegations Arrive, the Three-Power Conference to Commence Immediately</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - The British and American representatives who will participate in the Three-Power Conference on September 22nd have arrived in Soviet territory by plane.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 23rd - The British and American delegations arrived here yesterday and immediately discussed the Anglo-American plan to expedite aid to Britain. The formal meeting of the three countries' representatives is scheduled to begin today.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 23rd - Authoritative sources have recently stated that the German offensive in the southernmost part of Soviet territory has reached the point of threatening Rostov-on-Don on the Sea of Azov and the main lines of communication to the Caucasus. This fact may lead to a decision on whether Britain should fight alongside the Red Army.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 22nd - Gayda recently published an article in "The Italian Daily" discussing the upcoming meeting of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union in Moscow, stating briefly that the three countries would discuss the following matters: (1) The German occupation of Soviet-owned islands in the Gulf of Finland; (2) The siege of Leningrad; (3) The continuous reinforcement of German troops in the Smolensk region of the central sector; (4) Three German supply convoys are continuing to advance along the Moscow highway, having reached a certain point, but this has not been announced due to military secrecy; (5) A large-scale annihilation battle is underway east of Kiev; (6) Significant changes are expected to occur in the Kharkov area, as German aircraft, artillery, and infantry are cooperating in the operation, and the German army is advancing very rapidly, making the situation in the area very serious.</p>
<p>Soviet Ambassador Delivers Speech Hoping for Material Assistance from Friendly Countries</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky delivered a speech here today, stating that according to appropriate estimates, German losses on the Eastern Front, including those killed, wounded, and missing, total approximately three million men. The number of aircraft lost in three months is around eight thousand five hundred. The Soviet Union's current war is not only for itself but also for the safety and freedom of other countries. The fate of humanity will likely be decided around Leningrad and in the battles within Ukraine. Many amateur strategists speak of "severe winter" and "mud," but they do not know that such comforting words are extremely dangerous. The people of the Soviet Union prefer to base their expectations on facts rather than seek solace in wishful thinking. There is no doubt about the overturning of Hitler's original plan and the failure of the blitzkrieg tactics. The German losses are particularly severe. The figures announced by the German High Command a few days ago are not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. However, current facts prove that the German war machine is still very strong. The Soviet Union is currently facing a tense and difficult situation. The war on the Eastern Front will not come to a standstill in the autumn or winter. The Soviet people will never base their views on this questionable calculation. Currently, the enemy has occupied several important industrial areas. The Soviet Union has been forced to evacuate some of its factories and plants. It will take considerable time to reopen them at new locations. Therefore, the Soviet Union will find it increasingly difficult to replenish its material losses. During this period of hardship, assistance from other freedom-loving countries is urgently needed. The Soviet people have the right to hope for this assistance, because their brave fighting is not entirely for themselves, but in fact for the safety and freedom of other countries. Therefore, other countries should recognize that sending aircraft and tanks to the Soviet Union is in fact saving themselves.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd - Reliable sources announced today that the Soviet icebreaker fleet will try to keep the sea route to Arkhangelsk open during the winter to receive the American military supplies that have already begun to be transported along that route. The Soviet Union has established a special agency called the "Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration" to regulate various activities in the Arctic, such as icebreaking, Arctic aviation, meteorological observations, and commerce. Most of the American goods shipped to the Soviet Union will be transported from California, around Alaska, through the Bering Strait, the Arctic Ocean, and northern Siberia.</p>
<h3>American Ship Sunk Again Near Iceland; First American Ship Sunk Since Roosevelt Issued Shoot-on-Sight Warning</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd - The State Department announced last night that the US government-owned cargo ship "Pink Star" had been sunk in waters near Iceland. The ship was registered in Panama. This is the first American ship to be sunk since President Roosevelt ordered the Navy to shoot on sight any Axis ships found in American defensive waters. It is unknown how the ship came to be near Iceland, but Iceland is under American protection. The "Pink Star" weighed 6,850 tons and sank 45 miles northwest of the location where the "Sessa" incident occurred on August 19. The "Pink Star" was formerly a Danish ship and was requisitioned by President Roosevelt on July 12 under the authority granted by Congress and placed on the American shipping routes. The crew consisted of 24 sailors, whose condition is unknown. The sailors included one Dane, six Englishmen, one Canadian, three Belgians, eight Dutchmen, one Pole, one Frenchman, one Portuguese, one Irishman, three Chinese, and one Ecuadorian. The ship departed from New York to Iceland on September 3.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister of Burma Arrives in England, Will Visit the United States</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 23rd - The Prime Minister of Burma, U Saw, flew to England today. During this trip, he will also visit the United States and meet with President Roosevelt. It was announced on September 1st that U Saw is carrying a letter of goodwill from the government and people of Burma to Britain.</p>
<h3>One Million Japanese Troops Gather in Manchuria and Korea, Preparing to Invade Siberia; Anti-American Rhetoric Resurfaces in Tokyo Newspapers; US Strengthens the Far East Economic Front with Four Nations</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd - According to reliable reports from Manila, at least one million Japanese troops have been transferred to Manchuria and Korea in recent weeks. Since June of this year, and especially since the German army has been winning victories in Soviet territory, the Japanese army has shown a tendency to invade Siberia. According to those familiar with Japanese affairs, almost all Japanese horses have been transported to Manchuria, which is a very significant move. The preparation for war at any time is self-evident. The Japanese believe that they must first expel the Soviet troops from Vladivostok before Japan can hope to continue its southward advance towards Thailand, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. If they immediately advance southward, it will inevitably lead to military conflict with Britain, and the Soviet Union will also rise up to assist Britain, using its air force to bomb the Japanese mainland and its fleet.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sulek, 23rd - The Tokyo correspondent of the Turin People's Daily has frankly corrected the earlier assertions made by Italian newspapers that the Soviet Union had greatly reduced its troops stationed in Asia due to the need to reinforce the Western Front. It is claimed that, apart from Vladivostok, other Soviet bases along the coast, the Bering Sea islands, and the Kamchatka Peninsula have been rapidly fortified. The Soviet Far East Fleet has many submarines, high-speed icebreakers, gunboats, torpedo boats, and other more important warships. Recently, twenty Soviet warships arrived in Vladivostok and entered Asian shipyards for repairs.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 23rd - Since the beginning of US-Japan negotiations, anti-American rhetoric, which had long subsided, is now rampant again. The Nichinichi Shimbun wrote an editorial criticizing President Roosevelt's aid to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, stating that it was intended to achieve American global hegemony and to drive various countries to fight until they were exhausted. The newspaper said, "Pope Pius XII would never approve of the Roosevelt administration's daydream, recognizing its actions as a just war." The Hochi Shimbun commented on the US implementation of the convoy system, saying, "The United States insists that other countries must abide by international law, but it does its best to destroy all diplomatic norms." However, the Japan News Weekly, under the title "Patience," wrote that there was no reason for the US-Japan negotiations to be stalled. We should not be anxious because of the lack of official information on the US-Japan negotiations. The leaders of both countries must deeply understand the center of gravity of the current situation. We can trust that they will do their best to make the negotiations successful. Both countries should greatly change their attitude based on past differences. This is what Washington calls "exploratory talks." The newspaper concluded, "We believe that the relationship between the US and Japan will soon have a concrete manifestation, proving that it is proceeding on a concrete path towards peaceful coexistence."</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 23rd - The New York Times commented on the US-Japan talks today, saying, "This exchange of views will not lead to any loss, and may even be beneficial." But the newspaper insisted, "If the issue of the talks is selling out China to buy peace, then we do not want to hear it, and we especially never want to hear it."</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd - President Roosevelt's personal representative to India, Galbraith, recently gave a speech here, stating briefly that his mission is to strengthen the economic front between the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands in the Far East, to establish a barrier against aggression and to prevent any gaps. In this economic struggle, we must provide economic assistance to China and the Philippines. At the same time, the procurement of rubber, iron ore, and oil by the United States in the Far East must also be organized.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 23rd - The government formally denied yesterday that the French ambassador had requested the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam when he spoke with the US Secretary of State last week, but the government admitted that the discussion had mentioned the Pacific issue.</p>

<h3>Soviets to Establish New Defense Line on East Bank of the Donets River; Germany Announces Battle Results East of Kiev</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating, "On September 22nd, our troops engaged in fierce battles with the enemy along the entire front."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - Moscow radio telegrams stated that German troops besieging Odessa were counterattacked by the defending forces and retreated several miles. The official German news agency also admitted that General Vokshirov's troops in the Leningrad area had launched a strong counterattack. Soviet troops in the central war zone are still forcing the German army to retreat step by step. Although Smolensk is still in German hands, Soviet troops are currently advancing rapidly towards the city from all sides. In Ukraine, the Soviet troops who withdrew from Kiev are now attacking the German army fiercely east of the city. It can be seen that General Budyonny is trying to repeat his successful strategy in western Ukraine to allow his troops to withdraw safely without loss. It is reported that the Soviet counterattack around Leningrad is extremely fierce. Soviet troops are now using large numbers of tanks and heavy artillery to fight. Nazi Stuka dive bombers attempted to invade the defenses of Leningrad to supplement the lack of mechanized troops. The German communique also did not announce any progress in the area, which shows the success of the defending forces.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 23rd - The Hungarian High Command announced last night that the Soviet troops who broke through and retreated eastward east of the Dnieper River are being pursued. Their rearguard attempted to counterattack, but the communication between the Soviet troops seems to have been broken, and their resistance is weakening. This shows that the Soviet High Command has abandoned its efforts to continue fighting between the Dnieper and Donets Rivers and is concentrating on organizing the retreating Soviet troops on the opposite bank of the Donets River.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - In a certain location on the central front, our troops engaged in fierce battles with the enemy for five days. As a result, our troops annihilated six enemy infantry battalions belonging to the enemy's 123rd, 251st, and 102nd divisions. The Red Army also captured seven artillery pieces, 1,800 shells, and many other war materials. In another location on the central front, our troops annihilated 400 enemy officers and soldiers, and destroyed eight tanks and many armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 23rd, German Headquarters - This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet troops trapped east of Kiev are collapsing. German dive bombers hit a Soviet cruiser yesterday, which caught fire south of Odessa. Another torpedo boat and a patrol boat were hit. Nine Soviet cargo ships (15,000 tons) were destroyed. In the Kronstadt area, German aircraft sank one Soviet cruiser and one destroyer yesterday, and another cruiser and two destroyers were hit, and an oil tanker caught fire.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - According to a special war report released by the German High Command at the Fuehrer's headquarters, the Soviet troops east of Kiev attempted to break through, but have not succeeded. Soldiers are deserting in droves and have been captured. The number of prisoners has increased to 280,000. Soviet troops have lost or had destroyed 570 tanks and 2,100 artillery pieces, and 50 Soviet divisions have been annihilated. The commander of the Soviet 5th Army has been captured.</p>
<h3>Allied International Conference to be Held in London, Discussing Post-War World Reconstruction Plan; Soviet Union Will Participate for the First Time</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that an Allied international conference will soon be held in London. The theme of the discussion will likely be the Atlantic Charter signed by Roosevelt and Churchill and the post-war reconstruction plans of the Allied countries. Churchill will be the chief representative of the British side at the meeting. The Soviet Union will also attend such a meeting for the first time. It is expected that its representative will be Soviet Ambassador Maisky. All Allied countries will naturally express their agreement with the goals of the Atlantic Charter. As for post-war plans, the conference will discuss the conversion of war production to peacetime production, including the collection and storage of raw materials, and the distribution of them to the countries that need them most. The main purpose of the conference is to deal with international post-war reconstruction in a way that is based on cooperation rather than on each country's self-interest.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Lodges Another Protest, Soviet Union Sternly Rejects it; Claim that Paratroopers Landed is Fabricated; Bulgarian Prime Minister Issues Anti-Soviet Remarks</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 21st</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Bulgarian Secretary-General for Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with Alexanderoff, the counselor of the Soviet legation in Bulgaria, stating, "On August 11th and 28th, several Soviet armed personnel landed on Bulgarian territory along the Black Sea coast in rubber boats. On September 13th and 14th, some Soviet paratroopers also parachuted from airplanes in the Bulgarian territory of Duberlik." It was also stated, "On July 13th and 14th, the number of Soviet paratroopers who landed in Duberlik village was not just three, but six." The Soviet representative delivered the following reply from the Soviet government to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry: "The Soviet government completely rejects the protest of your government. The 'facts' claimed by your police are purely fabricated and not worth denying. In fact, on July 14th, your Foreign Ministry claimed that the number of Soviet paratroopers who landed was three. Two months later, your Foreign Ministry suddenly increased the number to six. This contradictory report proves that the claim that Soviet paratroopers landed on Bulgarian territory is entirely fabricated and of a provocative nature."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 23rd - The Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov gave a speech yesterday, stating that eradicating communism is the Bulgarian government's first task. Communism is a permanent threat to European culture, peace, and order, and its ideas are absolutely incompatible with the Bulgarian people's concept of freedom. Therefore, the Bulgarian people should do their best to eradicate this terrorist force. After the Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov went to the countryside for vacation, he probably won't be able to return here until after the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>New York Predicts Bulgaria Will Join the War</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd - Newspapers here predicted last night that Bulgaria will join the war, which shows Germany's intention to advance the war in Ukraine in the winter. However, Hitler may not be able to get much help from Bulgaria.</p>

<h3>If China Wins in the Far East, the European War Can Be Resolved Sooner: Gu Weijun Elucidates China's Three Major Goals in Fighting, Urging the Two Major Democratic Countries to Continue to Provide Practical Assistance to China</h3>
<p>London – My ambassador to the UK, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech on the BBC tonight, stating that the early achievement of China's aspirations in the East will certainly accelerate the victory of the West's war for freedom. It can be asserted that the trend of the Far Eastern war has definitely turned in China's favor. China's indomitable fighting spirit, great manpower, and increasing combat strength will exhaust Japan's energy. Although the Japanese army continues to reinforce, it will be of no avail. As of today, Japan is eagerly seeking to end the war against China. Even if it has not reached a state of complete despair, it is already in dire straits. Japan clearly knows that there is no other way to end the war except to abandon all that it has invaded. The democratic front's intensified economic sanctions against Japan have further increased its anxiety. The sacrifice and bloodshed of the entire Chinese nation's resistance over the past four years and two months have not dampened China's fervent fighting spirit, but have instead strengthened its determination to continue fighting until the aggressors are driven out of the country. Mr. Gu then put forward three basic reasons why China continues to fight unyieldingly: (1) China is fighting thoroughly for freedom and national survival; (2) If Japan's power is not eliminated, there can be no lasting peace in the Far East; (3) China's confidence in the ultimate triumph of good over evil cannot be shaken. Ambassador Gu continued that the Chinese people have a strong will, fight bravely, and need continued increased assistance from overseas in order to achieve victory sooner. Mr. Gu also analyzed indirect ways to assist China: (1) Do not supply Japan with military supplies; (2) Completely maintain the freezing of Japanese funds; (3) Do not relax or intensify economic sanctions. As for direct ways to assist China, Mr. Gu said that supplying China with military aircraft, tanks, and artillery will end the actions of [illegible] and make aggressive countries tremble, and realize that aggression will ultimately not pay off. The troops of free China, in [illegible], will be able to serve in other regions, thus making a greater contribution to the general principles of world democracy and freedom. Its huge manpower and abundant natural resources will be even more conducive to the concentration of the democratic front's strengths, and the result will greatly benefit the early achievement of the final victory for all parties. The war in China and the war in Europe are inseparable in terms of their mutual responsibilities and influences, he said. (21st dispatch)</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Guangdong Merchants Procure Single Yarn, Shuangma Make Up for Short Positions Eagerly</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been fluctuating the previous day, turned upward yesterday due to good spot transactions. Hong Kong merchants bought about 1,300 bales of various yarns. Most of their purchases were 32-count single yarns, and very few 20-count yarns were purchased, only 23-count Golden Rooster yarn. As a result, the sluggish morale was boosted, and the shorts, seeing the improvement in the environment, started to cover their positions, showing signs of recovery in the market. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,753 yuan, the lowest price was 1,736 yuan, the opening price in the afternoon was 1,755 yuan, rising to 1,763 yuan, and the closing price was 1,761 yuan. It is generally expected that the previous high of 1,772 yuan was seen before, and if the opening price today breaks through this price, it is feared that a price of 1,780 yuan will be seen. Today's shipments included 10 pieces to Xiamen and 25 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening of Shuangma in the morning was lackluster, saying that Hong Kong banned the export of drafts, US cotton continued to fall, and morale was poor. The opening price was 1,736 yuan, with little fluctuation around 38-39 yuan. The opening of the exchange was flat, and the market situation did not change much. At 1,743-44 yuan, it was then heard that Guangdong merchants were eager for 32-count single yarn, the market price rose, and morale was boosted. The trading floor suddenly tightened, and the bulls did not move. The shorts covered their positions, and the market gradually moved upward, rising to 1,753 yuan at the close. It is found that the total transaction volume in the morning was 10,295 bales. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,295 Fellow Traders 9,000</p>
<p>Total 10,1195</p>
<p>The Shuangma futures market situation, from weak to firm, seems to have turned upward. When it opened in the morning, the morale was still weak due to the near-term rise and far-term fall of US cotton. Factory orders were opened first, and immediately declined. Subsequently, the opening of the yarn futures, due to the chaos of the environment, the floating longs inevitably took the road, and for a time, the selling side took a strong position on the trading floor. Therefore, the October contract opened at 1,660 yuan, a drop of more than 6.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The November contract was 1,673 yuan, also down 3 yuan, and the December contract was 1,703 yuan, a slight drop of 1.5 yuan. After entering, it turned firm in a roundabout way, and the pulling of large households was particularly strong. Especially the gradual rise of factory orders, further aroused the excitement of yarn futures buyers. Therefore, the near-term and far-term rebounded successively, and the foothold was quite sturdy. The afternoon close had risen to 1.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan. In the afternoon, with the factory orders continuing to be firm, the bulls held and pulled up without loosening, and the market price fluctuated with a steady trend. Especially the far-term longs absorbed the most fiercely. As a result, the near-term closed at 1,669.5 yuan, up 3 yuan. The November contract was 1,682 yuan, up 6 yuan. The far-term closed at 1,717.5 yuan, a sudden increase of more than 13 yuan. Observing its trend, if the bulls insist on pulling up, without unexpected news stimulation, the market atmosphere may continue to rise. The market price is listed below:</p>
<h3>Belief in Coarse Velvet is Getting Stronger: Spot Cotton Trading is Booming, Autumn Rain Destroys the Quality of New Cotton, Ordering Foreign Cotton is Not Easy</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation has turned better, and the public's belief in the grouping velvet printing is getting stronger. This is because the yarn market has improved, and the quality of new cotton has been damaged again by the autumn rain.

<p>The New York cotton market fell because of a large number of cotton merchants hedging and the longs closing out. Yesterday's closing price was down about 10 pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first because of the closure of foreign cotton markets and the closure of longs and shorts. Although it rose slightly due to purchases by the industry, the market situation fell again due to the release of retail investors. As a result, the closing price fell by four or five rupees, etc.</p>
<p>It is also expected that the market situation will continue to be small when the market opens today.</p>
<p>Another news report said that the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was still lively. The order transaction was affected by transportation problems and was flat. It is expected that the position of Shanghai is quite complicated. At the same time, the application procedure is quite cumbersome. It is not easy to order foreign cotton directly.</p>
<h3>Finance: Period Cash Market, Interest is Low</h3>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the Central Bank and HSBC both hung up evenly. The black market exchange rate of British and American currencies continued to tighten. Chinese businessmen speculators had a total of 15,000 US dollars hedging each other, and the price was 5 yuan. There were still millions above [illegible] of speculative longs and shorts. The long side could sell to the bank at a price of 9 yuan 375, and the short side could not cover due to the cessation of supply from 14 banks. Therefore, among the speculators active towards the long side, even importers who were generally not allowed to apply had a stomach for 4 yuan 625. The closing price was about 1 pound 8125 and 4 yuan 625 for US dollars, which was the same as the previous day for British currency and 0625 tighter for US currency, it is said.</p>

<h3>Grain: Opportunistic Dominance Makes Rice Merchants Raise Eyebrows, New Hoarding of Leather Balls Occurs</h3>
<p>Although the foreign rice market presented a swirling situation yesterday, people's hearts were upward, and it was said that the fall of Kiev would make the opportunistic ambitionists look north and move south. Rice merchants got this news, not only did the leather ball gang stir up trouble, but also large outside customers also planned to take advantage of this unstable international situation, when the rice market has not yet broken away from the flat file, Xiao Jiao, although there was a secret plate shouting of one hundred and eleven yuan the night before, but there was no formal transaction on the market, the opening price was suddenly jumped to one hundred and twelve yuan, the outer stacks resisted one hundred and eleven yuan, and other goods followed the Ang, but not as active as Xiao Jiao, the price increase was also a bit inferior, after that, due to the profit floating and other households have a lot of high-rise exit cages, and the local real sales, more expensive and thorny, a move to turn loose, forming a more out less in, until the city, the bank stack small lines returned to the original plate, opened one hundred and nine yuan, the outer stacks one hundred and eight and a half yuan, so the entry and exit saw each other, all the way smooth, until the close, suddenly there were large households cheap to start, and the floating scattered and other households followed the absorption, the market began to tell the tension, each price once again excited, the results of the closing market bank stack small lines for one hundred and ten yuan, the outer stacks one hundred and nine and a half yuan, such as the No. 1 Saigon high goods for one hundred and twenty-two yuan, the market one hundred and twenty yuan, Zhongguan one hundred and seventeen yuan, No. 2 one hundred and twelve yuan, second one hundred and ten yuan, No. 2 Siam one hundred and eight yuan, Zhongguan one hundred and six and a half yuan, one hundred and six yuan, Min Tang rolling head goods one hundred and eighteen yuan, from Zhongguan one hundred and twelve yuan, broken tip high from eighty-four five yuan, second to eighty-two three yuan, statistics than the previous day continued to rise one or two yuan,</p>

The total daily transaction also increased. The current rice is 25,000 bags, and Yinghua Co. has more than 2,000 tons. It is also heard that corn is used for the production of molasses by alcohol factories, it is said.</p>
<p>The thick and thin Japonica rice, after the Nanyang Zao Po, which was once thrown away fiercely by the previous dynasty, yesterday caused the local stores to take advantage of the low-priced activities. Although the source continued to be strong, the market turned fixed, and it was calculated that 149 yuan and 2 corners came to 147 yuan. The Wuxi Thick Po had been lacking goods for several dynasties. Now, once it should be on the market, it is fresh and extraordinary. I saw the guests scramble to take advantage of the high price, so the cargo owner lived in the strange shouting, and the sale reached 155-6 yuan. Pudong New Japonica suddenly interrupted the arrival of goods, people's hearts turned panic, and the group raised the preparation for a time to supply, the market color is Tingxiu, and the price also returned to one or two yuan, opened 153 yuan and a half, second 152 yuan,</p>

<h3>Spot Sales of Tapioca Starch are Scattered</h3>
<p>Spot sales of Tapioca Starch yesterday were as active as before, but large outside customers moved their minds to oil and rice speculation, and the buying interest slightly subsided. However, the general floating leathers that have already been obtained are quite likely to take the opportunity to spit out, so the rising wind has been frustrated, and the market has turned into a flat stand. The total daily transaction also decreased to less than 10,000 bags. Although the market rose and fell once in the middle of the market, the results were still similar to the previous night. The artillery was calculated to be 33 yuan to 23 yuan and 1 corner, Jinlong Xizhan 31 yuan 23 corners, Dongzhan 31 yuan 8 corners to 32 yuan. The factory purchase price of wheat has not changed so far, but yesterday the rain blocked the transportation of each road, and the arrival source was even rarer. Those who held the hand goods also tried to take the opportunity to make a profit.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Merchants Resort to Manipulation Again, Oil Futures Raised by 7-8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the speculative buying of edible oil was quite prosperous, because the general oil merchants recurred the old ways, and again wanted to manipulate the market, there were hundreds of unscrupulous rumors, confusing people's hearts, and greatly raised the price. The futures market was raised by 7-8 yuan. The raw soybean oil, which had just been flattened, was also reported to turn from tired to Ang, but the actual sales are still Qingxian, and the source is continuous on the way, and another 400 barrels have arrived, and Dalian oil is also in contact with 10,000 barrels. Looking forward to the future, if the authorities do not prohibit the futures transactions of buying and selling short, the market will inevitably be disturbed again. Tongshi opened 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and Daoyou factory Qing oil futures reached more than 10,000 Dan. Rihua factory vegetable oil was about 5,000 barrels. (See the market price column for the price details.)</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Ball Uniform Factory Plate</h3>
<p>The coal ball factory plate, in the previous week, due to competition among the same industry, the secret plate had once fallen. Recently, both sides have reached a compromise, and the uniform factory plate, the Ming and dark markets have tended to be consistent. Yitaixing Nanyang Guohua and other large factory goods are sold by the same industry from the car stack list, each ton is 320 yuan, and the delivery is added to the car force. The main street door village is mixed, each load is sixteen yuan six corners to seventeen yuan two corners, the high and low are separated by six corners.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Miscellaneous Grains and Cotton Cloth are Transported to Hong Kong and Xiamen</h3>
<p>Today's export goods, transported to Xiamen, include 350 bags of beans, 1,000 sheets of bean cakes, and 32 pieces of piece goods. Transported to Hong Kong, there are 385 pieces of piece goods and 99 pieces of tea leaves.</p>
<h3>Cork Oak (II)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The amount of cork that cork oak can supply each time depends on the thickness of the tree body: roughly from one kilogram to one hundred and ninety kilograms, and at most to two hundred kilograms. According to each acre can be planted with 1,000 cork oak trees: but the Iberian Peninsula has a forest area of 600,000 acres! Most of them belong to Portugal, and the production is extremely high, and people can imagine how rich the interest is. As for Algeria and Tunisia, although it is said that there are also nearly 500,000 acres of forest land, the development of this industry is relatively late, and people are also grassy and pay little attention. What's more, there is a periodic fire to carry out large-scale destruction, so its cork production is pitifully small!</p>
<p>People pack the collected cork planks of different sizes into packages and transport them to the cork factory; then stack these planks in the open air, with the concave side down, and press them with heavy stones. After several months of display, they are then subjected to the selection procedure, removing the damaged parts, and classifying them according to quality; after that, they should be placed in a steam pot that is tightly controlled and subjected to the steaming process while being pressed with heavy objects. This procedure is necessary to make the cork planks flat and straight. Later, people put these steamed planks in an air-circulating open shed, and then dry them for five or six months, and steam them again, the cork is more soft and easy to be chipped.</p>
<p>The steamed cork planks are separated according to thickness, extensibility, fineness of grain, and color: depending on whether people want to make that kind of wood, or shoe soles and other kinds of items, they should be suitable for the material. For example, when making corks, people divide the planks into small pieces from large pieces, and peel them off with special machines, or by workers with extremely sharp thin knives. Working with machines is fast, but there is more discarded material; manual work is slow, but there is less waste: Fortunately, now there is a good use for the remnants left over from making corks, etc., so you are not afraid of the machine's too much waste of the East and West.</p>
<p>The stripped corks, before being put on the market, must also be subjected to a smoking process: that is, the corks are placed in a drawer made of iron bottom, which is tightly sealed on the outside, and sulfur is burned below. The purpose of this smoking is to destroy the organic spores existing in the cork cells or pores: because this kind of thing can produce mold under certain circumstances, which is very harmful to the beverages stored in the bottle. The condition of a good cork should be that the tissue is uniform, dry, extensible, and without defects. For ordinary use or ordinary drinking, the second-class cork can also be used; but to preserve the top-quality famous wine, especially for the sparkling wine that can foam, it must be the top seven choices: because only the best cork will not change the taste of the wine.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Issues Special Purchase and Transportation Permits to Regulate Commodity Prices; Divided into Two Types: Exclusive Use and Importer Sales; Sugar and Kerosene are Eligible for Special Permits</h3>
<p>Since the Stabilization Fund Committee announced that starting August 18th, it would provide foreign exchange for the import of essential goods at new prices, with the full cooperation of various Allied banks and the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, the Shanghai market has shown signs of improvement, and the interests of legitimate merchants have been safely and firmly protected. However, due to the special environment of Shanghai, the orders issued by the authorities have been difficult to implement, inevitably leading to confusion. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, recognizing the significant impact of this matter on the interests of all merchants in Shanghai, yesterday specially investigated the truth of various measures from relevant parties.</p>
<p>Three New Measures Have Been Established</p>
<p>To promote the consistency of measures and enhance the efficiency of implementation, the Ministry of Finance announced on September 1st the repeal of the originally established: (1) Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods, (2) Measures for Obtaining Import Permits for Goods Prohibited from Import During Extraordinary Periods, (3) Measures for Obtaining Import Permits for Gasoline, (4) Measures for Cracking Down on the Commercial Sale of Goods Prohibited from Import, (5) Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods to Obtain Exchange Rate Differences, (6) Measures for Reporting and Transporting Foreign Exchange Settlement for Export Goods, (7) Implementation Measures for Selling and Settling Foreign Exchange for Postal Packages, and (8) Revised Measures for Restricting the Reporting and Transport of Export Goods for Transit. At the same time, it also announced the revised Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods, Measures for Cracking Down on the Commercial Sale of Goods Prohibited from Import, and Measures for Reporting and Transporting Foreign Exchange Settlement for Export Goods that Should Be Settled. These three measures are extremely important, but due to space limitations, the "Revised Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods" will be published later. The remaining two measures all have strict regulations and will be published at a later date.</p>
<p>Import Permits are Divided into Two Types</p>
<p>Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods: (1) All imported goods specified in the Customs Import Tariff numbers listed in the appendix to these measures shall be prohibited from import. (2) Goods prohibited from import in accordance with these measures shall also not be allowed to be reported for transit, except for those that were taxed for import in accordance with the National Government Import Tariff before the promulgation of the ban (before July 1, 1939) and have not yet been designated for sale. (3) If the import of prohibited goods is for the purpose of regulating market prices, supplying special uses, or for other legitimate reasons, and has been verified by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may issue a special purchase and transportation permit based on actual needs. (4) Import permits are divided into two types: exclusive-use permits and commercial-use permits. The scope of their application is as follows: (A) Scope of application for exclusive-use permits: 1. Government agencies intending to purchase prohibited goods to regulate domestic market prices or for special purposes. 2. Public and private organizations, individuals, and all legitimate enterprises intending to purchase prohibited goods for scientific, industrial, medical, health, charitable relief, educational, cultural, religious, or other special purposes, with genuine needs. 3. Others that the Ministry of Finance approves as eligible for the issuance of exclusive-use import permits. (B) Scope of application for commercial-use import permits: 1. Sugars under Customs Tariff Numbers 397A and 397B. 2. Kerosene under Customs Tariff Numbers 532A and 532B.</p>
<p>Matters to be Applied for When Obtaining a Special Permit</p>
<p>(5) For goods falling within the scope of exclusive-use permits, the purchaser shall first clearly state in detail the type, name, brand, country of import, quantity required, specific purpose, etc. of the goods to be transported in an application form, submit it to the central competent department for verification, attach opinions, and forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and issuance of an exclusive-use import permit, based on which the goods can be reported for transportation. (6) For goods falling within the scope of commercial-use permits, the purchaser shall first clearly state in detail the type, name, brand, country of import, estimated sales quantity, sales area, etc. of the goods to be transported in an application form, submit it to the central competent department for verification, attach opinions, and forward it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and issuance of a commercial-use import permit, based on which the goods can be reported for transportation. (7) The provisions of these measures shall also apply to prohibited import goods sent by mail from overseas or transferred for transit from domestic ports. However, gift packages mailed by overseas Chinese, declared by the consignor or recipient, and verified by the import customs as being used for gifts, may be exempted from obtaining a special permit and allowed to be imported. (8) In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of these measures, the Ministry of Finance shall establish a special committee for the review of special purchase and transportation of prohibited import goods to handle the review of applications from various agencies and merchants for the purchase of goods prohibited from import during extraordinary periods.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection, Verification, and Rewards for Smuggling Suppression</p>
<p>(9) The import permit obtained by the purchaser shall be submitted to the customs or freight inspection office for verification and release upon import. (10) Prohibited import goods transported without an import permit shall be confiscated by the customs or freight inspection office in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, and the matter shall be reported for verification and handling. Those discovered by the designated freight inspection agency shall be immediately transferred to the customs or freight inspection office for handling. (11) The prohibited import goods confiscated by the customs or freight inspection office shall be rewarded from the proceeds of the sale according to the following percentages, with the remaining funds reported and remitted in accordance with regulations: (A) For those discovered by the Shanhaiguan or freight inspection office: 1. Personnel of the discovering agency: 20% to 30%. 2. Personnel of the assisting agency: 10%. (B) For those discovered by the customs or freight inspection office based on informant reports: 1. Informant reward: 50%. 2. Personnel of the discovering agency: 10% to 20%. 3. Personnel of the assisting agency: 10%. (C) For those discovered by the designated freight inspection agency and transferred to the customs or freight inspection office for handling, regardless of whether there is an informant: 50% reward shall be given uniformly, to be distributed by the inspection agency itself. (12) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Slight Changes to Prohibited Goods</p>
<p>The prohibited import goods in the revised measures include various goods specified in 165 Customs Tariff numbers, which are slightly different from those promulgated on July 1, 1939 (the original text can be found in the August 22nd report). According to a comparison made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, there are only decreases and no increases in the goods in the revised measures. The deleted items, which have been decontrolled, are as follows: Tariff Number 139: Rattans; Tariff Number 381: Bulk Pepper; A: Black Pepper; B: White Pepper; Tariff Number 520: Mineral Motor Oil, Naphtha, Flat Chen Gasoline, and Various Unlisted Engine Fuels, including A: Cased; B: Bulk. All other items remain unchanged. According to the Customs Import Tariff, there are a total of 671 items, divided into 16 major categories. In addition to the 165 items prohibited from import, the remaining 507 items can still be freely imported.</p>
<h3>Special Property Tax to be Levied Next Year; Principles Already Decided; Approved After Review by the Advisory Committee; Various Industrial and Commercial Sectors Will Be Taxed Equally</h3>
<p>The Advisory Committee established to decide whether to agree to the Shanghai Municipal Council's levy of a special property tax on business premises held its first meeting at 4:30 p.m. on the 22nd in the Shanghai Municipal Council's conference room. The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, and the Secretary-General, Phillipo, delivered speeches successively, and then discussed the Municipal Council's proposal to levy a special property tax on business premises. After review, it was unanimously passed in principle, but it was considered necessary to review the proposal to classify exchange and other business premises as Category A and other general business premises as Category B, and it was advocated to abolish the distinction between Category A and Category B. At the same time, it was agreed in principle that the Shanghai Municipal Council would begin implementation in January next year. The various issues that have not yet been decided will be discussed at the second meeting to be held at 4:30 p.m. on the 24th. According to the original plan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the tax would be levied in two categories: Category A would include securities, finance, and commodity exchanges, with a special tax of 15% levied annually based on the assessed value of the property; Category B (excluding those used purely as residences and those listed in Category A) would include offices, shops, pawnshops, factories, warehouses, docks, etc., with a special tax of 8% levied annually based on the assessed value of the property.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Allied Banks Have Indeed Stopped Black Market Foreign Exchange; Absolutely No New Customer Transactions Accepted; Only Forward Customers Still Need to Be Settled</h3>
<p>Rumors that the black market for foreign exchange is still active, and that the fourteen banks have not been able to completely disassociate themselves from the black market, were inquired about by a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency from relevant parties yesterday. It was said that since the Hong Kong meeting decided to take thorough and effective measures to crack down on the black market, it has absolutely not participated in black market transactions. This move has been assisted by Allied governments, so the fourteen banks have been able to cooperate effectively with the Stabilization Fund Committee from beginning to end. The reason why the black market has not been completely eliminated is mostly due to banks other than the fourteen buying and selling their own positions, but the scope is very narrow and the number of transactions is small, and it cannot influence the market. A senior staff member of Mercantile Bank also said that the fourteen banks have indeed stopped black market trading as of now and have not accepted new transactions. However, one thing must be explained, that is, forward transactions made in August, such as September futures, must be settled with customers before the end of September. Since the banks have a contractual relationship, they cannot break the contract, and there are private transfers between them. For example, if Mr. Zhang made September futures, he sold them to Mr. Li because he did not need them. When the bank settles, Mr. Zhang still comes forward, then the bank cannot interfere with the private transfer transaction between Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li. Also, if Mr. Zhang's customer does not use the September futures and cannot find a suitable customer for a while, he will transfer to October futures, and the bank will only accept his request. But it can be asserted that this kind of transaction will inevitably become less and less in the future and will eventually tend to decrease.</p>
<h3>Suspects in the Post Office Embezzlement Case Released Again; Two Others Heavily Suspected; Heard They Have Been Transferred Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration embezzlement case, the suspects, Wang Xuchu, an employee of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and three old clerks, and two guards, who were taken to Hongkou by the Japanese and detained in the old site of Wing On Bank, except for Wang Xuchu, who was released last month, the remaining five people, including the old clerks and guards, have not been released. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, it was learned that two of the above-mentioned detained suspects were released last week, but the post office did not admit it, so it is still difficult to confirm. It is also learned that the two most suspected of them have been transferred elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Chilean Consul-General in Shanghai Inspects British Troops</h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's Fourth Regiment will hold an invitation for Mars to inspect the troops at the Racecourse tomorrow (the 25th) at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>President Tyler Ordered to Sail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The President Tyler, which supplements the voyage between the Eastern Route and Shanghai, was originally one of the twelve ships allocated by the U.S. Maritime Commission for sailing. The ship was formerly a cargo ship of the President Lines and was usually used to carry cargo. Since seven ships, including the President Coolidge, were requisitioned, the President Tyler will sail directly to Shanghai from San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Guam in the first week of next month, and will arrive here with a large amount of American goods. Since the President Lines' ships were requisitioned, there were seven vacancies, but twelve ships were adjusted and dispatched by the U.S. Maritime Commission to sail to the Far East one after another for cargo transportation. In fact, it is equivalent to an increase of five ships, but since the Coolidge and McKinley have resumed voyages, and the President Pierce will soon (the date of arrival in Shanghai is said to be postponed to the 27th of this month) resume voyages from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the shipping has increased by eight ships, so the Far East shipping will be more frequent. Other ships will also arrive in Shanghai one after another.</p>

<h3>Labor Disputes Gradually Subside; More Than 200,000 Workers in Factories in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Since the rise in commodity prices in this port, labor disputes in various industries have fluctuated. After the active adjustment by the Settlement authorities, commodity prices have gradually fallen back recently, and both labor and management have been sincere with each other, adhering to the meaning of sharing the same boat and cooperating sincerely. Labor disputes have gradually decreased. According to statistics released by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the number of labor disputes that occurred last month has decreased to 17 in the International Settlement, with 5,926 workers on strike, resulting in a loss of 48,153 working days. There were 4 cases in the French Concession and 2 cases on the roads outside the boundary, resulting in a loss of 110,433 working days. Statistics also show that the number of workers employed by factories in the International Settlement and on the roads outside the boundary has now reached 227,750, an increase of more than 20,000 compared with 201,590 in the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Autumn Seasonal Diseases Unabated; More Than 1,000 Deaths Last Week</h3>

In the French Concession, 249 Chinese residents and 12 foreigners died, totaling as many as 1,268. Among them, diseases such as typhoid and malaria have tended to decrease, but influenza is quite prevalent.</p>

<h3>False Testimony Proposed in the Case of the Ticket Seller Pushing a Passenger to Death; Questioning of Yan Defa's Evasive Testimony; Instructions for Further Verification; A Visit to the Home of Witness Jiang Jing</h3>
<p>The case of Wang Wanxiang, a ticket seller from Haimen on Tram No. 358 of the British-owned Tram Company, who pushed Xiang Dongchuan, a passenger from Wenzhou, to his death due to skimming money, was heard in court yesterday. The presiding judge, Shi Meiyu, detained the witness, Yan Defa, for giving false testimony and transferred him to the prosecutor's office for investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office specially appointed Prosecutor Wu Qihua to handle this case. Mr. Wu immediately opened a criminal court and brought Yan to the case to question him about the reasons for giving false testimony and who instigated him to do so. However, Yan's testimony was vague, so Prosecutor Wu ordered him to be detained and continued to interrogate the witness after summoning him.</p>
<p>Public Opinion Praises the Courage to Act for Justice</p>
<p>In the case of Xiang Dongchuan being pushed to death by Wang Wanxiang for a ticket, the only witness is Jiang Jing, a student at St. John's Middle School. Because he happened to be on the tram that day to return home, he witnessed the entire tragic incident and, undeterred by intimidation, stood up to testify. His courage to act for justice has aroused social sympathy and great praise from public opinion. Yesterday, a special visit was made to his home, and the details are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Powell Subsidizes His Schooling</p>
<p>Jiang Jing is from Changzhou. His father, Jiang Bingliang, used to open the Wuzhou Shoe Store on Sanma Road, but due to his weakness and incompetence, he was eventually calculated by others and left. His family is very poor, and he has five younger siblings who cannot afford to study. Only he was subsidized by Mr. Miller's Powell and was able to study at St. John's Middle School. In March of last year, he once planned to go to the interior to find another way out, but he was troubled by travel expenses and returned to Ningbo, still studying at his original school.</p>
<p>Witnessed the Incident on the Way Home from School</p>
<p>On September 13th, it happened to be Saturday and also his birthday. His family prepared noodles to celebrate. He took Tram B No. 352 on Route 20 to go home and witnessed the details of the tragic incident. Unwilling to let the deceased's injustice sink to the bottom of the sea, he stood up to testify. He told his mother what he had encountered, but his mother was timid and thought that the deceased was already dead. She did not want to convict someone with his words, which would not only be uneasy for her conscience but also invite resentment. Jiang thought that his mother's teaching was indeed the guideline for those who only cared about themselves, but he could not help but feel uneasy about the deceased's injustice sinking to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Mother and Son Argued Slightly</p>
<p>He also cited the example of Zhang Sixu, the manager of the Ta Mei Evening News, who died in the Kislings, and even that foreigner was motivated by righteous indignation, disregarding difficulties and dangers, and rushed to pursue and arrest the gunmen, even though he suffered tragic injuries, and his righteous heart eventually won praise from public opinion. What is this person to do? If everyone embraces self-preservation, how can the public safety of society be guaranteed? At that time, the mother and son had a slight argument due to different opinions.</p>
<p>Yan's Wife Hesitated in Her Words</p>
<p>Yan Defa's testimony may only be based on Jiang's mother's teachings, and concealed Jiang's true intentions. Yan and Jiang live together, and there are only two plank beds in the house, which were insured for 2,000 yuan. When the reporter visited, Yan Defa was detained for testifying, but his wife was talking and laughing as usual, and did not show any unhappiness because her husband was detained. When asked when Yan chatted with the leather craftsman Zhou Zhijiu about this matter, she was immediately stunned and did not know how to answer. Then she said that it was when eating dinner in the alley, and then she said that she was not very clear. Later, when the reporter asked Zhou Zhijiu when Yan talked to him about this matter, Yan's wife wanted to interrupt, but Zhou stopped her and replied that it was at about 10 o'clock. Such a situation is really incomprehensible. Later, according to Jiang Jing's mother, since Jiang came out to testify, strange men have come to the house from time to time, uttering intimidating words, and even threatening that if he does not change his testimony, he will have no place to die. Now Jiang dares not live at home.</p>
<h3>"Butterfly Grass" Anti-Smoking Pills Contain Large Amounts of Poison; Police Raided and Seized More Than 70,000 Pills; Yesterday They Were Sent to the Court Pending Further Verification of the Arrest of the Main Culprit</h3>
<p>There are many types of anti-smoking drugs in this city, which are too numerous to mention. However, in reality, there are many deceptions. The Butterfly Grass anti-smoking pills produced by the Yunnan Tiannan Pharmaceutical Bureau sold by the Xinguang Pharmacy at No. 61 Lloyd Road have various advertisements that are dazzling and confusing. The promotional materials even include a registration certificate and a chemical verification certificate from the Central Health and Chemical Verification Institute to prove that they do not contain any anesthetic ingredients. However, after investigation by the anti-drug personnel of the Public Concession Police Department, the so-called Yunnan production and no toxic ingredients in the drug are all deceptions. The drug is manufactured inside the Xinguang Pharmacy, and its main ingredient is morphine. Those who take it will not only fail to quit smoking, but will also become addicted to drugs, which is extremely harmful. In order to prove the facts, on the 12th, twelve Butterfly Grass pills were purchased from the pharmacy for 3.6 yuan and placed in a bottle, which was handed over to the Public Works Department's health department for chemical verification. According to the report of the chemical verification results, each pill weighs 0.306 grams, and its morphine content is 1.5 milligrams (one-forty-fourth of a gram). According to international law, it can be said to be a drug if it contains only a few milligrams. Now the morphine content of the drug reaches 1.5 milligrams, and its toxic ingredients are huge. Therefore, an application was made to the First Special District Court for a search warrant, and Chief Detective Ye Yuxi, Detective Wang Shusen, Detective Zhao Baosheng, and Guo Shouxin rushed to search the pharmacy. They seized about 828 bottles, totaling more than 70,000 pills, as well as a large number of promotional materials, glass bottles, etc., worth tens of thousands of yuan, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, explained the situation and requested that they be dealt with. Then, the detective reported the situation of the search, saying that when they went to the pharmacy to search, a man named Jiang Yinwan claimed that the drug came from other places, and there were only twelve bottles containing twelve pills each, which he handed over to them. However, they could not believe it completely. When they searched upstairs, they found seven or eight apprentices working, bottling Butterfly Grass pills. The workers were wearing mouth covers, which clearly showed that the drug contained poison. If the drug did not contain a large amount of poison, why would the workers need to wear mouth covers? The Jiang man seemed to be a responsible person, but the police are still secretly investigating who else is involved. Judge Feng reported to the court and ordered that all the seized items be temporarily stored in the warehouse, and that the case be verified again after the arrest of the person in charge.</p>
<h3>Two Cars Collide on Avenue Edward VII Last Night</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 p.m. last night, at the Hook Bridge intersection on Avenue Edward VII, a French-owned Public Bus No. 21, number 835, driven by driver No. 85, was speeding east when a black-plated car, registration number 7328, approached from the opposite direction. Because it was too late to avoid it, a collision occurred. The two front lights of the black-plated car were shattered, and the fenders were badly damaged. The front of the bus was also slightly damaged. A passenger in the car, named Lin Furen (30 years old, local, owner of Renxin Detang Chinese Medicine Store in Dapu Bridge), suffered a severe head injury and lost consciousness on the spot. Chinese police officer No. 1852 from the Old Gate Police Station arrived, recorded the number of the public bus and the driver who caused the accident, and immediately accompanied the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shimada Shot, Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Ta Mei Evening News, a Japanese man named Shimada Inosuke, 41 years old, was shot while walking along Nanjing Road near Shanxi Road at 3:05 p.m. yesterday (the 23rd). A bullet hit his left abdomen, and another bullet hit his brain and came out of his back. He was rushed to Fumin Hospital, where surgery was performed to remove the bullet from his abdomen, but his injuries were serious, and his survival is uncertain. It is widely believed that this case was due to political reasons, as Shimada is the representative of the Nanjing Japan Insurance Company. It was also reported that a Chinese pedestrian was hit by a stray bullet in the leg and was sent to Renji Hospital. After the bullet was removed, he has now left the hospital, and his injuries are minor.</p>
<p>It was also reported that Shimada Inosuke, a Japanese man and a special commissioner of the Japan Maritime Insurance Company stationed in Nanjing, was shot at around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday while passing through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. He is currently being treated at Fumin Hospital. As for Cai Qiusheng, the pedestrian who was hit by a stray bullet, the bullet has been removed from Renji Hospital. It is also heard that the police have arrested seven suspects after the incident.</p>
<h3>The Chen Family is Not the Owner of the Jinling Restaurant in the Bomb Case</h3>
<p>In the Jinling Restaurant at Nos. 419 and 421 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, a hand grenade was suddenly thrown in as a threat at noon on the 21st of this month. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Jinling Restaurant is a partnership organization and has been established for many years with a total capital of 10,000 yuan, divided into dozens of shares. Chen Guanghai, the Cantonese man whose young son was kidnapped, only invested 250 yuan, accounting for one-fortieth of the total shares. Chen is neither the owner nor the manager. As for the throwing of the hand grenade, it was actually due to a misunderstanding. Chen has stated to the police that his son was kidnapped because the bandits mistakenly believed that he was wealthy and coveted his wealth.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Mu Weijun Joins Thurburn and Brook Law Firm</h3>
<p>Lawyer Mu Weijun, the son of economist Mu Shensis, graduated from Shanghai Law and Politics College in his early years, majoring in law. He has more insights into commercial law and has published many papers in major daily newspapers and magazines, which are highly respected by society. It has recently been heard that due to the urging of relatives and friends, he will soon join the Thurburn and Brook Law Firm to handle civil and criminal litigation, Chinese and foreign litigation, and all non-litigation matters. In the future, he will serve society based on what he has learned and will definitely make many good contributions.</p>
<h3>Increase in Wages and Meal Allowances for Paint Industry Workers</h3>
<p>Approximately over four thousand workers in the city's paint industry recently requested an increase in meal allowances due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, sending representatives such as Yu Zhiqing to negotiate with employers. Yesterday (the 23rd), after negotiations between the representatives and industry association leaders Ni Fusheng, Li Qingtang, and others with employers, the employers agreed to increase wages by 2.70 yuan per worker and meal allowances by 2.50 yuan, totaling 5.20 yuan. This labor dispute was successfully resolved thanks to the mediation of Ni Fusheng.</p>

<h3>Hope and Encouragement (2): Written after the Industry and Commerce Group Scholarship Fund, by Applicant No. 46</h3>
<p>Reflections</p>
<p>In the statistics mentioned above, many unimaginable facts are revealed very clearly:</p>
<p>First, "the fervent thirst for knowledge of employees in the 'Isolated Island' era," especially shop assistants and apprentices, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total (of course, we cannot compare this with the total number of shop assistants and apprentices in the city at the moment). From this, it is very clear to tell the public about the hardship faced by shop assistants and apprentices today, and their eagerness for knowledge. It also reveals that only a laborer can feel the personal hardship and strive for wisdom to meet the responsibility of transforming society.</p>
<p>Second, "seizing the current era." The era is different. Our doors have been opened wide. While the national essence must be preserved and promoted, Western science and technology must also be accepted more and more to prepare for building a new China. At the same time, Shanghai is a major trading port, and trade with foreigners requires language as a medium. Therefore, many people choose to study industry and English. Furthermore, due to the complexity of today's commercial institutions, the updating of old accounting practices, and the establishment of new business methods, 20% of people specialize in business subjects. These things reflect the turbulent and complex society of today, and the trends of tomorrow's society. It can also be seen that Shanghai's conscious youth have the confidence to seize the era and strive for light in their respective positions.</p>
<p>Third, "forward-looking business managers." I know the customs of old-fashioned shops.</p>
<p>Generally, apprentices or employees don't have extra time to study at night. However, there are countless apprentices and employees who have been allowed by the authorities to fulfill their desire to study. I believe that among the applicants, there is a deep sense of gratitude for the convenience given by the managers of the respective firms and companies.</p>
<p>Fourth, "rare flowers on muddy soil." In the approved list, twelve are unemployed, three are laborers, and two are employees of dance halls. I don't want to say much to these seventeen beneficiaries, but I am most moved and admired because they didn't think of their low status, or being abandoned. They have self-confidence and can raise their heads and strive in the crowd. I want to learn from them.</p>
<p>Finally, strictly speaking, it should be a regret that it has not really been popularized to every corner. For example, there are more than 40 applicants from the Sincere Company, but the number of employees at Wing On and Sun Sun is no less than that of Sincere, but the number of applicants for study is less. The same is true for the tobacco and miscellaneous goods industries, which are rarely found. However, these cannot be said to be corruption or a lack of ambition among some shop assistants; I believe they originally wanted to apply very much, but were hindered by the ridicule of their colleagues, or unnecessary self-esteem and excessive worry, which led to shrinking back. I hope not to miss the opportunity during the second event.</p>
<p>Hope</p>
<p>Hope for various tutoring schools: After the war, Shanghai's population increased sharply, creating countless "convenient" tutoring schools that sprung up. The proliferation of schools is indeed a happy sign, but since some people praise schools as "shops," we, a group, have to appeal to the school authorities and teachers to strictly manage education in the future, take this opportunity to improve as much as possible, eliminate the past casual and playful attitude of tutoring schools (if there really is one), and clear the bad concept of "shop" among the public. This is expected to be accepted by the school's teachers.</p>
<p>Hope for the scholarship committee: I personally demand that you, the committee members, supervise, encourage, and investigate the students' learning situation from time to time, so as not to waste a cent of the donations. Of course, this work is larger than the review during the application, but it may be undertaken by capable beneficiaries. In this way, on the one hand, they work and study, and on the other hand, they begin the training of social service. I don't know what you think?</p>
<p>Hope for various companies and business firms: In this approved list, it reflects that many shop assistants are excellent. They have ambition, are willing to work hard, and are willing to be loyal to their duties and do their best for the serving firms. Such personnel are rare talents for the future development of a firm and are the pillars of building a solid foundation for a business. They come from hardship and know the difficulty of starting a business. They do a lot of practical work and understand the internal workings of the industry. Therefore, giving these employees more attention, I believe that the future help to the company will be greater than any effectiveness. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the authorities of various companies and firms will save some other expenses each year and transfer them to the "colleagues' education fund." In this way, there is no need to bother the public anymore, and it avoids depriving shop assistants from smaller firms the opportunity to study, which helps others and benefits oneself, killing two birds with one stone. What do wise managers think?</p>
<p>Hope for vocational education and scholars: Employees study by stealing time from their busy schedules. They are extremely eager to find the shortest route to achieve the highest goal. At least they don't want to take a roundabout path. Therefore, I hope that wise scholars will publish in newspapers or hold public lectures from time to time to publish the essentials of learning methods and the basic attitude of reading for each subject. Other things such as the correct concept of life are instilled. Industrial and commercial employees have been rescued from deep water by the Shen Bao and its readers, but the road ahead is long, and their steps still need to be guided and guided by advanced teachers.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Implementation of Itinerant Teaching Methods, Divided into Long-Term Assembly and Temporary Assembly Teaching</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education, based on the Interim Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education, has issued and implemented the Measures for the Implementation of Itinerant Teaching. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 10, Paragraph 3 of the Provisional Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Compulsory Education. Article 2: In areas where there are the following circumstances, itinerant teaching classes may be set up in more than two locations, with one teacher providing instruction itinerantly: (1) Areas that are vast, with scattered villages and inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to concentrate children; (2) Areas that are barren, sparsely populated, and unable to set up schools; (3) Nearby schools are full, unable to expand, and unable to accommodate all out-of-school children; (4) Children who cannot attend school full-time or half-day due to transportation, living, or occupational reasons. Article 3: Itinerant teaching classes are divided into the following two types: (1) Long-term assembly: one class is set up in each village or at a suitable location, with a minimum of 15 students per class. If the number of children in each class is less than 10, one teacher must teach at least two classes. Children attend school full-day or half-day in the morning or afternoon. When the teacher is at the school, the teacher directly teaches or assesses. When the teacher leaves the school, the student leader leads and guides self-study. (2) Temporary assembly: one class is set up in each village or at a suitable location, with approximately 5 to 15 students per class. The teacher must teach at least three classes. Children are usually scattered and gather at a scheduled time. The teacher comes to the class to teach, or the student leader leads the study. Article 4: To implement itinerant teaching, a survey should first be conducted on the local situation and the location of the classes, and the method of setting up the classes and the time and frequency of instruction should be determined. Article 5: Itinerant teaching should be based on the principle that each class receives itinerant instruction every day, but the itinerant instruction system may be adopted every other day depending on local conditions. The length of time for each class is determined based on the distance and the number of classes. Article 6: The curriculum of the itinerant teaching class should be based on the short-term primary school class curriculum, but it may be based on the regular junior primary school curriculum depending on local needs. Article 7: School board members, assistant school board members, village heads, and people who are enthusiastic about education in the itinerant teaching area should assist itinerant teachers in borrowing common houses or civilian houses as locations for setting up classes. Article 8: The equipment for itinerant teaching classes, such as desks and chairs, should be provided by the children's families or borrowed from existing public objects as a principle, without being restricted by form. When necessary, they may be purchased in appropriate quantities. Article 9: Itinerant teaching classes may use tools such as itinerant teaching vehicles or education boxes when necessary. Article 10: Teachers for itinerant teaching classes should be selected from those with relatively good teaching performance. They should also be given appropriate training before implementing itinerant teaching. Article 11: Each itinerant teaching class should train older and outstanding students to be student leaders to lead children to study on their own when the teacher is not present, and to assist the teacher in handling teaching and moral education matters. Article 12: Teachers of itinerant teaching classes should pay attention to assessing children's academic performance and must hold a term examination at the end of each semester. Article 13: The period for ending itinerant teaching classes is based on the completion of the curriculum. Those who pass the examination at the end of the period may be given a certificate, which is considered to have received short-term compulsory education. Article 14: The funding for itinerant teaching classes shall be allocated from the compulsory education funds of each county and city. Article 15: These measures shall be implemented by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Yu Junxian Inspects Overseas Chinese Education in Singapore</h3>

<h3>Our Ordinary Expectations Regarding the Tram Ticket Scalping Homicide</h3>
<p>— Pingye</p>
<p>Over the past ten days, we have received no fewer than six or seven hundred articles from readers requesting that we uphold justice for the case of Mr. Xiang Dongchuan, who was pushed and killed by a tram ticket seller. We sympathize with the readers' enthusiasm and admire their sense of justice. We restrain our excitement, repeatedly calm our minds, and pray for a rational and fair judgment. Today, after reading the news of the court's trial of this case, we can no longer hold back what we want to say. In the past, our reluctance to speak was out of a desire not to influence the legal judgment with words and emotions. Now that the police lawyer has requested that Wang Wanxiang be severely punished according to the law, it can be said that it is the same as what we want to say. We respect the law and are confident that the law will not disappoint the unanimous hopes of the community regarding this tragic case. Therefore, as for Wang Wanxiang's deserved punishment, we are willing to quietly await the court's judgment and still do not want to discuss it further here.</p>
<p>What we want to say now is: In order to eradicate ticket scalping, the efforts made by the community to cooperate with the tram company have exceeded the tram company's own efforts to rectify discipline. Mr. Xiang Dongchuan is a representative of small doubts, and Mr. Xiang is also an unpaid, unpaid, and impartial ticket checker. In the event of this misfortune, how the company should repay his moral behavior is the company's business, and it is also what we need to know. As for the company's majestic announcement urging passengers to "check whether the amount paid is the same as the fare" and "report to the company at any time," passengers should correct the dishonest behavior of ticket sellers for the benefit of the company and the public. If the correction is ineffective, and even leads to a struggle to promote justice, resulting in being pushed and killed, the society trusts the company and cares for the company. How should the company thank the society and the passengers? This is not a humanitarian issue, but a question of whether the company should bravely take responsibility.</p>
<p>Since there is a witness, Xu Shenjin, who was pushed down at the same time, but suddenly a suspect of perjury, Yan Defa, appeared, the facts are clear. We do not want to waste words, but if the court's investigation is clear and Yan Defa is found to be a perjurer, then where is his conscience? Yan Defa has his own deserved punishment, and those who instigated Yan Defa to commit perjury should not be allowed to go unpunished either. This is another hope of ours.</p>
<p>Our greatest hope is not to cry out for injustice, nor is it merely to seek justice for the deceased. We hope that Wang Wanxiang will accept the legal judgment with peace of mind and tell those who come after him to be vigilant and enlightened. Wang Wanxiang is taking the place of the scalpers to receive social criticism and legal sanctions. If this tragic case can clear up scalping in the future, then even though Wang Wanxiang has suffered for himself, he has also done the work of rescuing some scalping ticket sellers. When his sentence expires in the future, we can also say that Wang Wanxiang eliminated the scalping trend that could not be eliminated for many years because of scalping. Isn't it true that one person is punished, and the public benefits?</p>

<h3>Sketches of Life in a Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>— Phile</p>
<p>Snow White, Empty Fort Strategy, Candied Hawthorns</p>
<p>"Amazing! Amazing!"</p>
<p>The moment I mention that I work in a cotton mill, it elicits strange envy from others, as if this job were located on the top floor of an international hotel?</p>
<p>I think, at least I can use this to "show off" a bit!</p>
<p>Is a cotton mill job really that great? Let me show you:</p>
<p>Street Patrol</p>
<p>Two legs are the greatest asset of a cotton mill worker; for a full twelve hours, from "Middle Alley One" to "Side Alley," from "Front Row" to "Fourth Row," it's rare for the feet to stop. Once unemployed, we are very confident in applying for the position of patrolman, more than capable of standing guard or patrolling the streets all day long.</p>
<p>Grand Symphony</p>
<p>Iron, motors, and belts, together playing a grand symphony, guaranteed to send your eardrums flying into the air. Without the good fortune to listen to this music, you often can't hear a word for half a day after leaving the factory, but we are more than capable.</p>
<p>Snow White</p>
<p>Cotton fibers, following the rotation of tens of thousands of spindles, fly up, making the entire factory look like it's snowing heavily. Every worker's hair, clothes, and shoes are decorated beautifully, after a few hours, either as Santa Claus or Snow White!</p>
<p>Abalone Shop</p>
<p>"Humidity" is the lifeblood of the weaving room, so the windows are never closed. It must be really foggy to prevent the yarn from "breaking" due to dryness. The sized yarn, plus the humid air, smells great!</p>
<p>Once I took a friend to visit, and soon after entering, he retreated, holding his nose. He runs a salted goods business. I playfully asked him: "Is it like entering an abalone shop?" He shook his head and laughed: "I sigh that I can't compare!"</p>
<p>Singing the Empty Fort Strategy</p>
<p>Probably because the physical exertion is too great, the cotton mill workers' appetite is simply frightening. Eating five or six bowls is not considered unusual at all. The dishes in most cotton mills are all "thickened with starch," so how can they withstand the sweeping of these wolf-like friends? Therefore, "to avoid having rice without vegetables, one must seek lightning-fast action" has become the cafeteria's motto. Otherwise, you have to prepare your war attire and sing the Empty Fort Strategy.</p>
<p>Art of Skimming</p>
<p>Every cotton mill worker is in debt to the night shift. The two eyelids are like locked up. Therefore, one can only resort to "skimming," which means secretly resting.</p>
<p>To be able to skim without hindering work, you can only contact the "supervisor" (female foreman). The supervisor, after drinking a few sips of flattery, becomes very enthusiastic, supervising the workers for you, more loyal than yourself, so you can rest assured and take a break!</p>
<p>Candied Apples</p>
<p>Many people are envious of the cotton mill job, probably because of this "bonus." Indeed, it has become the central hope of most cotton mill employees. As the settlement period approaches, everyone is busy inquiring about how much they will get. "Candied Hawthorns"?(three months' bonus)</p>
<p>A bonus of ten to twenty months is called a candied apple, and more than twenty months is considered eating an apple - a big bonus!</p>
<p>However, often the candied apple doesn't arrive, and you only get to eat a candied hawthorn (three months), so you can only hope for next year.</p>
<p>Everything I've provided is true. If anyone still thinks a cotton mill is a good job, I'm willing to give it up at the lowest price. Why not come and try?</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Characters in the The Case of the Swapped Prince</h3>
<p>— Liutang</p>
<p>4\. Emperor Renzong and the Eighth Prince</p>
<p>Emperor Renzong only learned that he was not born to Empress Liu until after her death, from his uncle Prince Yan. Empress Liu died on the Jiawu day of the third month (the month had 29 days, if it was a small month, it would be the 28th). On the seventh day of the fourth month, Prince Yan told Renzong that he was born to Consort Chen, and he was greatly saddened, and he honored Consort Li as Empress Dowager. (Later she was posthumously honored as Empress Dowager Zhuangyi, and Empress Liu as Empress Dowager Zhuangxian) Prince Yan also said that Consort Li died unnaturally, and Renzong was even more saddened and did not attend court for several days, and issued an edict blaming himself. In the ninth month, he personally went to Hongfu Temple to worship and replace the coffin. He saw that Consort Li's complexion was as lifelike as if she were alive, and her crown and clothes were the same as the Empress Dowager's. She was preserved with mercury, so she did not decay. Renzong sighed: "Are people's words credible?" At that time, the ministers repeatedly criticized Empress Liu in front of Renzong, and by then he knew that some things were not credible, and Empress Liu's posthumous treatment was even more generous.</p>
<p>After Renzong knew that he was born to Consort Li, Cai Xiang reported that Yan Shu had once been ordered to write an epitaph for Consort Chen, but did not mention that the Emperor was born to Consort Chen, and Yan was demoted for this. Yan said that Empress Liu was in power at the time, and he did not dare to say it directly, so it was not his fault. Lü Yijian was also dismissed as prime minister for supporting Empress Liu, and was reinstated after it was known that Li Fei's burial was all due to Lü's intentions. Yan Shu was also reinstated later.</p>
<p>Prince Yan, also known as the Eighth Prince in novels, is mistakenly thought to be the son of Emperor Taizu, but in fact all the sons of Emperor Taizu had already died during the reign of Emperor Taizong, how could they have survived until this time? Among the sons of Emperor Taizong, the prince ranked eighth, hence the title of Eighth Grand Protector. As a child, he was quick-witted and intelligent, and Emperor Taizong especially loved him for his resemblance to himself. At every court gathering and banquet, he ordered him to attend by his side, saying that he would not allow him to leave the palace to take up a fief until he was twenty years old. Therefore, he was called the Eighteenth Grand Protector in the palace. When Emperor Zhenzong ascended the throne, he still stayed in the palace. In the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, he had an affair with a palace maid and set fire to the curtains, causing a disaster to the palace pavilions and internal treasury (the Chunhua Pavilion books and rubbings were all burned). He was caught and began to live in the residence of the Emperor's son-in-law, Shi Baoji. Because he had been in the palace for a long time, he knew the palace affairs in detail (Emperor Renzong was born when Prince Yan was still in the palace). Moreover, he had a broad forehead and a full face, and was stern and unapproachable. Therefore, the officials of all ranks, both high and low, and the people in the palace all respected and feared him, and his name was known to foreign countries. Even Empress Liu alone was afraid of him. When Empress Liu was in power, the prince kept his eyes closed and hid his remorse, closing his doors and cutting off contact with people. He knew that he was highly respected and feared that Empress Liu would be jealous of him, so he deliberately spoke nonsense and feigned insanity, and no longer attended court. When Empress Liu died and Emperor Renzong took power, he was even more honored and favored. Therefore, in novels, whenever there are major events and crises, the Eighth Prince always comes out to solve them, which is based on historical facts. At that time, Prince Yan's words of praise or criticism moved the court and the public. When he heard that Yuan Hao was not subdued, the prince said, "What's the use of a prime minister?" Those who heard it were all afraid of his words, which shows how important his reputation was.</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12\. Unexpected Disturbance</p>
<p>"It's none of your business! I'll return a daughter to you through myself!" Yu Kun was really strange, refusing to explain it to him. "In short, from today onwards, you give me a good sleep, take your medicine, and in at most half a month, Mei Bao will definitely be back!"</p>
<p>After saying a set of words, he also made a face at Qiu Haitang. Although more than twenty years had passed, his personality was still the same as when he was learning opera in the Yuzhen troupe.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang barely endured it and lay on the kang. He only heard him busy in the two rooms outside for a while, and then rushed away again. If he hadn't previously had the experience of exchanging Mei Bao back from the hospital, Qiu Haitang wouldn't have had confidence in him and would never have dared to let him go at this time.</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi's brother had probably already been instructed by him. As soon as he left, he locked the front door early.</p>
<p>The reason why Yu Kun didn't tell Qiu Haitang his plan first was because he had his own difficulties; but Qiu Haitang couldn't really settle down until he understood what kind of medicine he was selling in that gourd.</p>
<p>The clock struck eight, and a small village market like Zhangshucun was almost completely still. Qiu Haitang and Zhang Laoliu, both unconsciously cocked their ears, sitting precariously in the bedroom on the left and the hall on the right, respectively, listening attentively to the movements on the street outside.

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Tan Fuying and Cheng Yanqiu</h3>
<p>— Jingchun</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai National Opera scene is far from its previous prosperity. Besides the renowned Kun female performers Zhang Wenjuan and Ma Yanfen performing old plays, the rest are all performing new plays to entertain the audience. The Tianchan Theater's "Emperor Liang Wu," the Xin Xin Theater's "New Journey to the West," the Gong Stage Theater's "That's Me," and the Da Stage Theater's "Legends of Gods and Swordsmen," have all had considerable appeal since their performances, but those who love singing feel listless and are disappointed not to see pure Peking Opera! Wenjuan's art is still enough to satisfy opera fans; but as a weak woman, there is no excessive expectation. If Tan Fuying is hired by the Da Stage Theater, and Cheng Yanqiu takes the stage one after another after Zhang Ling, then in the future, not only can one choose what one likes and listen to it freely, but also the isolated national opera scene that has been dull for a long time can be restored to its original state and present a lively atmosphere. According to reports, Fuying's previous performance at the Xin Xin Theater was excellent. This time, all the supporting roles are even better than the previous ones. And Yanqiu's plays, such as "Mei Fei," "Locking the Kylin Pouch," "Wenji Returns to Han," and "Golden Lock Record," are especially enjoyable no matter how many times you listen to them! Someone said: "Such a situation of confrontation will inevitably compete with each other," but Cheng is a Qingyi, and Tan is a Xusheng. The opera paths are different, so there is no competition at all, and there is no possibility of competition. It is said that the total salary of all the actors in the Tan troupe is 40,000 yuan for a month. As for Yanqiu's Xiaosheng, it was originally Jiang Miaoxiang, but because Jiang and Tan have a relationship as father-in-law and son-in-law, he decided to follow Fuying, and the Golden Authority has invited Yu Zhenfei to cooperate with Cheng.</p>
<p>In the future, she does not hope to rely on filming movies like her father. Her ambition is in drama work, and she wants to live a stage life for the rest of her life. The future of this artist is limitless.</p>
<h3>Standard Little Thing Wang Wei (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>Soon she went to "China Travel" to guest star. In "Ge Nen Niang" she played Li Shiniang, in "Sunrise" she played Little Thing, in "Thunderstorm" she played Sifeng, and she also had roles in "The True Story of Ah Q" and "Hua Mulan"</p>
<p>Tianfeng was established, and she was recruited as a basic actor. In "Gratitude and Hatred," she played Xiaoxiang, and in "Sunrise" she still played Little Thing. — She is the only standard Little Thing on the stage!</p>
<p>When the Huasheng Drama Society performed "Yue Fei" at the Lyceum, she guest-starred as Xing'er, who assassinated Qin Hui. According to her, this play was the most satisfying and most memorable to perform.</p>
<p>Recently, through Xia Xia's introduction, she joined the Shanghai Drama Society. She is rehearsing "Miaofeng Mountain" these days.</p>
<p>She had only been to the film studio once to see her father filming. Naturally, she admired her father's villainous style. She told reporters:</p>
<p>"I have seen most of the films my father has been in. He is a very good person, but on the screen, he simply makes me want to die of anger."</p>
<p>Playing the piano, singing, and watching movies are Wang Wei's hobbies.</p>
<p>Among Hollywood actresses, she most admires the acting skills of Bette Davis.</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Opera Figures</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi wrote the biography, Zhang Yizhang produced the illustrations</p>
<p>(1) Xue Yanqin</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin (Huang Yongni) is to female roles what Mei Lanfang is to male roles. They are both worthy of being called unprecedented figures in the opera world. However, Mei Lanfang is still from a family of actors. His fame, although relying on his own inventions, is also half due to his family background, so he achieved success very early. Xue Yanqin's background is just an irrelevant role in Tianqiao. She strove forward and was able to achieve success, and her artistic achievements reached a profound level, laying the foundation for her later status. This sharpness is indeed admirable, and compared with Mei Lanfang, there is a distinction between difficulty and ease, and it can also be said to be a spiritual mushroom without roots, and a sweet spring without a source. Xue Yanqin's opera initially benefited a lot from Shang Xiaoyun's guidance, but on stage, her "voice," "appearance," and "singing," "dialogue," and "expression" all followed the right path and achieved naturalness. Shang Xiaoyun sometimes can't help but be overshadowed, and the praise of surpassing her teacher is truly worthy of her. As for her graceful demeanor and generous behavior, she is not only the leader among female roles, but also among male roles, except for Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, there is no way to place her. She has now married into a noble family of the Qing Dynasty and no longer performs.</p>
<h3>Movie Story of "Family" (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>After the New Year's Eve etiquette was held, they ate the New Year's Eve dinner. The old and young of the Gao family all gathered together at this time. In addition to the old master Gao, there were the next generation, Kemin, Kean, and Keding. The next generation, Juexin, Juemin, Juehui, Juequn, and Jueying, etc. In addition, there was the old master's favorite concubine, Aunt Chen, and the stepmother of Juexin, Juemin, and Juehui, Zhou. With the dependents of Kemin and others, they were all lively and prosperous, which can be said to be the best of times. At this time, the old master was generously talking about his fantasies in his prime, so he took the opportunity to express his wonderful theory of five generations living together, and at the same time, he earnestly taught his descendants, asking them not to forget the good teachings of the ancients.</p>
<p>Although Gao Juexin occupies the position of the eldest brother among the younger generation, his personality is like a tame sheep. He only knows how to obey in everything and only bows to people. However, Juemin and Juehui are very different. They are born with a kind of rebelliousness. They do not agree or follow blindly. Especially Juehui, has a stubborn character. He had long deeply felt dissatisfied with the system of the big family, but his seniority was too small to express it.</p>
<p>Aunt Zhang and Miss Qin also came</p>
<h3>Crimson Petals in a Shower of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17 A Crown Angered for a Beauty</p>
<p>He returned to Ningyuan, and all the generals under his command came to visit. At this time, Xu Jing and Liu Yinying had already gathered with Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei, talking about everything. Zhang and Chen did not want to leave distant guests in the camp without the commander, so they invited the two to stay at a small inn nearby, and ordered the innkeeper to treat them well and not neglect the guests. The innkeeper saw that it was General Zhang who had invited them, so he naturally obeyed the order and did not dare to neglect them. After the two stayed at the inn, Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei came to accompany them to drink and talk every day. Sometimes they rode horses together to hunt in the mountains. Liu Yinying's镖method was indeed very powerful, and there was a clang when it was fired. However, from the fierce birds in the sky to the脱兔at the edge of the grass, every shot was hit, and none could escape, even Chen Fei, who was good at shooting and drawing arrows, was greatly admired. Zhang Cangqiu watched and stroked his beard and smiled, extremely proud. They selected the delicious ones from the hares they hunted and brought them back to cook, and tasted the wild flavors. Sometimes everyone carried various military equipment and practiced martial arts in the rear of the camp, dancing swords and knives, which was also very interesting. In this way, they waited for Commander-in-Chief Wu to return. Sure enough, Wu Sangui had returned from the capital. Wu Sangui had a close guard who was very skilled, named Bai Shi'er, about thirty years old, very loyal to Wu Sangui, and liked to drink, but he respected Zhang Cangqiu's martial arts very much, and often drank with Cangqiu and others. Sometimes he told them some things about Wu Sangui. Zhang Cangqiu also got along very well with him. This time Wu Sangui went to the capital, Bai Shi'er naturally followed him, and when he came back, he naturally wanted to meet Zhang Cangqiu and others. (176)</p>
