<h3>澳洲海相休士宣佈　英艦隊將增防遠東　在事態緊急時作有效之自衛此為對日再行南進直接警告</h3>
<p>路透社四日雪梨電　澳洲海相休斯、昨日發言謂、美國所予英國之援助、當可使英國於需要時遺其艦隊、前來太平洋云、陸相史本特稱、澳人必須防備轉瞬可至之危險、澳洲必須儘速達到其最高軍力、過去三四個月中、澳洲軍事效率之增進、即為澳洲旨趣　堅定之明證、軍隊今皆終日準備、隨時可全都出發、澳洲已採行應付嚴重時局之重要計畫、惟澳洲全境今尚有不少嬉遊、當陰　漸將密佈時、吾人應停止娛樂云、外相史都華、亦發言糾正若干方面所有澳洲未似其他自治領積極參加對日經濟限制之印象、謂自一九三六年以還、澳日間未有商的、僅有貿易辦法、故無需正式通</p>
<p>路透社四日新加坡電　澳海相休士所發英國如有必要、能派遣艦隊至太平洋之宣言、已引起此間之甚大興奮、各方面皆期特英國對付日本侵略之效力、因英國在太平洋中、未有强大艦隊而大爲减削、一般人雖以爲萬一與日本周旋之日、美國必將派其艦隊加入太平洋中之任何爭鬥、但今知英艦隊亦可參加之消息、自將更收安慰人心之效、任何人明知英國派遣艦隊前來遠東、將須若干時日、惟皆信仟英國現在遠東之强大軍力、巳可在任何緊急中作有效之防衛、以待艦隊之到達、並預料英艦駛抵之後、英國在此方面世界之態度、將由守勢而迅速改爲攻勢、此間華方人士均坦白承認對於英國此項堅決之表示、有深刻之印象、據某重要華人語路透社訪員云、英國因越南事件、已毫不猶豫加日本以制裁、現於日本開始脅迫泰國之際、英國又作以上之宣言、故可認爲係對於日本再行前進之一種直接威脅云、</p>

<p>合衆社四日東京電　去週間美日兩國雖因互採經濟報復行動、而見緊張、惟東京今日有連續不斷之謠言、謂美日有進行談判、以在遠東成立妥協之可能、據稱、屆時日本希望美國承認日本在東之盟主地位、日本則願對民治國採較和緩之政策、並願中止進一步之侵略、截止至目前、美日成立妥協之努力、僅在試探性質之階段中、惟所可重視者、厥爲日本並不乘美國凍結日本資金之機會、而使兩國關係惡化、反取較爲溫和之政策、此舉可於藏相小倉撰著論文、謂日本願鬆弛凍結之限制、僅須美國願同樣行動見之、此間均認美日間之關係、現已達有史以來、最惡化之階段、惟衆鄭重指出、日本現已處於歧路之間、必須當機立斷、非選擇一反以前所爲之最後政策、卽斷然投入軸心協物、衆又指出日本現時之政府、實由退伍海軍領袖所組成、此輩對商業有重大關係、主張與能與日本貿易之國家爲　、而不　　僅　與日本作政治上往還之國家爲友、蓋從後者之中、日本於危機到來時、實不能取得　何援助也、此間對美國凍結日本資金之事、雖有不少採取敵對之反響者、惟失部份人十之反　、則實　溫和、卽有所　響、亦僅係國內利益着想、若對目前之反響加以分析、則是表示日本一般輿情、　屬溫和可親、被者一方建議互相放寬凍結、一方面則向日本人民保證、謂政府已準備應付　對美貿易斷絕而起之後果、「報知新聞」　日撰評稱、”本已決定向南面以和平　式發展勢力、以抵制英美之包團、而應付任何　聯之威　、</p>
<p>美日仍在討價還價</p>
<p>野村　使顧問忽忽自華盛頓趕回日本之事、此間咸認或係與野村之調停計劃有關、權威當局指出美日如能愼重進行探討、互和接近之可能問題、則局勢將甚微妙、因兩國咸願取得最有利於討價、還價之地位也、是以眾認美日兩國、將大舉宣傳、各稱、已之政策未變、關於此點、一般人士可劃分政策與外交之分野、日本心目中所謂　策、即爲在東亞成立和平及合作、以避免歐戰延及東亞、此事與三强公的並無根本上之關係、而僅爲響時之外交血已、「朝日新聞」記者、曾訪問日本派駐越南之首席軍事代表澄田、澄田稱、日本「東亞新秩序」、建議、已內與越　成立聯防協定而告「完成」、此舉與日本報紙一部份所稱、越南步驟乃在「保證日本後門之安全」、並謂日本不致再有南進侵略之語、互相吻合、「國民新聞」同時以樂觀口氣預稱、日本殊有與荷印成立新協定之可能、屆時日本可以和平方式、取得荷印油類、英美外交界於是遂對與日本早日能接近一事、極　關切、渠等指稱、軸心之一貫技倆、即在每一重要行動之後、而宜佈此後不再作更進一步之壓力、吾人有良好之理由、是以得信日本目前所遭受之經濟壓力、對其政府領袖、實應加以權衡、以此爲觀點、</p>
<p>日財相願與美談判</p>
<p>如小倉最近在「日日新聞」上曾對華盛頓宣布、如美國能認淸日本因建立「東亞新秩序所費之人力財力、日本願與美國商討、惟渠又指出、日本對此項損失、必須獲得補償、自德蘇戰事爆發以後、德國在日本之勢力業已削弱、蓋日本顯已逐漸自作主張、而持獨立之政策也、此對於德國大使沃特亦頗能認為極確買者、與此相關連者、則為德國之突然「承認」「南京政權」、此事頗堪重視吾人可以猜想、其用意在安慰日人、蓋日人素望德人進攻英倫、而非蘇聯也、此一事件、如今竟强迫日本停止其對荷印之經濟談判、而造成最近英美聯合對日制裁之經濟壓力、報知新聞記者武藤曾稱、野村大將蓄意改進美日關係、但其結果、則適得其反、美人業已獲一結論、謂日本無論如何、不能反對美國矣、彼又稱、當美國對日封鎖日益嚴厲之際、此項政策如繼續實施、甚至可造成一種誤解、「認爲吾人乃在獻媚」、彼稱、此非野村外交之成功、美國之所以不敢用武力向日挑戰者、其眞正原因實爲美海軍之毫無準備也、」一讀賣新聞」則一再着車於美蘇在遠東之關係、認爲美蘇一旦接近、而在遠東成立軍事協定、必將加緊封鎖日本也、美國以油類迷往蘇聯、足以表示擊盛頓已決定取道太平洋航綫、並已不再顧及日本對三國盟的之關係矣、「讀賣新聞」又稱、美國接濟蘇聯、其所取得之補價爲在堪察加覓取根據地、而取譴阿留西安羣島、運兵至阿拉斯加云、</p>
<p>國際社華盛頓四日電　華盛頓官方表示、日本倘於五月中、物不見德國在、蘇戰局中、獲得決定性之優勢、將與美國重行修好、若輩之立論有二、（一）日本不擬白荷印奪取油類供給、以冒與民洽國開戰之危險、（二）美國之汽油及油類禁運、堪與日本之戰鬥力以致命打擊、譏是之故、行見日本一百察知德蘇衝突形成消耗戰時、即將建言美國、緩和油類禁運政策云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海人士應培養定力</h3>
<p>此旬日來、上海人心，又起浮動，惴惴然若不可終日，嘗研究其所以致此之故，由於局勢變更者半；由於人爲者亦半。局勢之突趨激變，若日軍之進佔越南，美英之凍結中日資金，均足以引起南太平洋之大戰，一髮牽動全局，或將影響上海之地位，個人安全，利害切身。疑慮恐惶，在所難免，此或猶有可說。若夫人爲之震驚，則純由投機者之掀風作浪，造謠生事，其消息之詭譎離奇，有爲事理所必無者，而亦輾轉相語，騰播市塵；往往僅憑私人臆測之詞。奔走言說，不旋踵間，遽成一「確切不移」之消息，聽者固未敢斥其謬妄，言者自亦認爲理有固然，於是彼此互詰，更從而推闡之，愈求證實，愈趨歪曲；社會人心，受其鼓動，無法抑制情感，益增惶懼之思，此種人爲之震驚，影響所及，爲害甚鉅，言之固屬可憫，要亦無可宥恕者也。</p>
<p>吾人嘗有一感覺，竊以爲上海人心浮動之眞正因素，殆由於缺乏定力。所謂定力者，心凝於一境，無可變動，無可搖撼，能破除亂想，能克服困難，質言之，即在任何環境之下，秉此定力，具一貫之思想，抱堅强之意志，絲毫不爲外物所更易是也。今者上海人士似不易獲得此種定力；而神經又異常銳敏，每一風暴之來，、非特無法應，抑且先自騷動，每因無謂之驚疑，招致若干禍患，即以物價言之，物價初未嘗高也，乃因憂慮或有激漲之一日，遂向之須備一月者，茲乃積一年之需，凡食糧燃料以及一切爭先囤儲、日用物品，莫不大事搜購，以作一勞永逸之計，殊不知憑此浮動之心理，反足以刺激物價之上騰，需求失其準衡，物價遂以飛漲，而投機囤積之徒，又從而推波助瀾，於是生活日高，莫可遏阻，升斗小民，遭受痛苦，此均由於人心浮動，缺乏定力所激成。</p>
<p>以言上海在目前所處之地位，上海前途，誠屬可慮，然而亦有可不慮者在，蓋上海爲一具有國際性之城市，商業權益，爲各國所共具，不僅華人應予以葆愛，，即英美人士亦應予以關切，、要亦各國人士所應共同予以愛護者。使上海一旦而遭受毀滅，固華人之不幸，亦豈英美與各國之福？吾人推論上海之地位，似未可囿於上海一隅，而應就其遠者大者言之，夫吾人所公認爲圖謀不利於上海者，其最大慾望，乃在上海以外，設使其所謀不遂，，海固無所損也，設使所謀而就，上海又髯能倖免？今者民治陣綫與侵略國之分野判然，吾人就民治國家之文塲言，所冀望者乃在民治陣綫之最後總勝利，不必斤斤於一時之得失，與夫片刻之茍安，惟有定方者始能有此期待，亦始能獲得此最後之光明。</p>
<p>猶有若干微妙之事件，都因憂疑惶懼而招致，譬之某一舉動，其最初或根本無此意嚮，乃亦妄加揣測，以爲必有此一日，而好事渲染者，更百般張羅，根據法理，詳加徵引，大事抨擊，一若此事之來，即將迫在眉睫者。吾人試一思之，在此種情况之下，凡抱有企圖者，縱不欲有所行動，殆不可能，於是由毫無事實之謠傳而竟成爲事實，「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，皆人心浮動之咎由自取也。</p>
<p>吾人侷居於孤島之上，晏然嬉然，苟一念及顚沛流離之同胞，午夜自省，慚感交縈，若猶不力自振拔，惴惴然於小我之得失，是誠何心哉！時至今日，舉世殆無寗靜之土，欲謀絕對安全，斷非僥俸所可致，亦非一個人或少數人所可獲致，更非神經銳敏終日惴惴者所能企求而得。吾人必須依靠自己，依靠自己的國家，求百年之長治久安，非求一朝一夕之苟安。</p>
<p>於此，應正告土海人士者，吾人當從事培養定力，袪除浮動之心理；而定力之培養，允須從加强信念入手，蓋信念不立，定力即無由生。果具堅强之信念，即能懸一正確光明之鵠的，禱祀以求，悉力以赴，任何艱難困苦，必能從容應付，任何憂盧焦思，必能强自克制，徒自相驚擾何爲哉！</p>
<h3>郭外長在中樞紀念週　報告最近國際情勢　英美對日一致加強反侵略陣綫民主國澈底經濟封鎖日必崩潰</h3>

<p>抵抗意志</p>
<p>絕未鬆弛、該訪電又稱、德官方宣佈、將東加里西亞置於德方民事行政官管轄下、而成波蘭德政府之一部份已使烏克蘭國家主義派發生此區將成獨立烏克蘭的一部份之希望云、南區蘇軍司令布特尼上將昨稱、德軍已在基輔之西與南布成廣大弧形陣綫、此綫從最北端之柯洛斯丹起、向南而至激戰多日之傑吐米爾、復向東南折往貝拉雅左柯夫（基輔西南四十五哩）云、或傳德軍在烏克蘭展開鉗式運動、旨在截斷蘇聯中部與烏克蘭鑛區及敖得薩啣接之重要鐵路錢、目下烏克蘭已成主要戰綫、且今日又傳到極北前綫續有戰事之消息、芬方承認該區蘇軍</p>

<h3>日艦司令　行抵西貢</h3>
<p>路透社四日東京電　據某日報接訊、駐越南海面日艦隊總令司親見海軍中將、昨由康瀾灣行抵西質、於招待新聞記者時宜稱、日軍開至越南、今幾告成令功、日法締結聯防越雨協定、日本按照協定條款加派軍隊駐紥越甫、毫不停滯、此誠可爲建設東亞共榮圈賀者也、渠將恪守聯防之精神、越南政府與人民竭誠與日軍合作、以便利日軍開入越南、渠實不勝感慰云、</p>
<h3>日海軍將在　康瀾灣設防</h3>
<p>合衆社叫日東京電　日日新聞駐西貢特派通訊員本日報稱、日本海軍將在越南康瀾灣設防、以爲應付中英美荷包圍之行動根據地、日文報紙對於所傳中英美冀圖使蘇聯加人包圍集團一說、仍甚爲注意、</p>

<h3>民治陣綫的總賬房</h3>
<p>財政部職務的門類，一般人都不大熟悉，除徴收關稅和國家歲收，發行及償付公債外，還包括造幣廠和鈔票印刷廠，並有擔任特務工作的麻醉品緝私局，平時還有海防隊。近年以來，財部職權更大大擴充，旣須管理關係各國的平準基金，還須依照民治國援助法與英國接洽在美購買軍火事宜，以及保管凍結的外國資產。這些資產總額，截至今年六月底止，的在叫十四萬萬美元以上。最近被凍結的日本資產，及中國自動要求凍結的資產，數目可觀，尙未計算在內呢。</p>
<p>指導如此大規模的事功，實是一種扛鼎的工作。所以財政部人員除了埋頭苦幹，因時制宜之外，別無其他出路了。從外表上看來，財政部大廈那冷冰冰大理石覆蓋的一列長廊，以及舊式鍍金的壁柱，不大會使人相信裏面工作的繁劇。殊不知在沿走廊一排嵌白板窗的大門後面，財政專家們，一天到晚，在那裏動腦筋打算盤，草擬稅則，推進國防儲蓄，計劃新債券，注視金融市塲的發展和資金的進口出口。本國國防和援英援華，支出浩繁，所籌經費，不得不超過原額，以便應付裕如。</p>
<p>摩根曹是慣於早起的人。每晨六時半起牀，到七時半照例閱讀紐的及華盛頓兩地的報紙，並用電話和一兩個屬員通話。他最喜的一個部員，從自已家裏出發，步行兩哩，到部辦公。每晨八時四十五分，摩根曹必已坐在辦公桌前，準備處理一天的工作。每晨九時半，財政部有一個幹部人員會議，參加的有次長和各級司長，自十人至十二人。</p>
<p>會議地點是在二樓西南角部長辦公廳。室內充滿優雅，柔和，莊嚴的空氣，與其說是辦公廳，不如說是私人圖書館。這座百年大廈的共餘屋子也與此髣髴。</p>
<p>參加此項會議的幹部人員，環坐部長四周，部長開頭照例報告一些大家應該知道的重要情報。於是逐一詢問圍坐的一圈人，請他們發表高見。會議具有討論性質，有時非常熱烈，但從不作意氣之爭。這是部長規定的原則。</p>
<p>至於家根曹本身，他坦白承認財政是他畢生的事業。他不顧別的事情攪擾他的興趣。白天辦公不算外，晚上往往帶一束報紙回家，以備晚餐後閱讀。</p>
<p>他除開每星期一天在白宮陪總統午餐外，平常總在辦公室底下一間小室裏進午膳，上下有私人電梯可通。這間屋子裏有一張橢圓形的桌子，上次歐戰後，那不幸的債務條的，就是在這裏討論和簽字的。（完）</p>

<h3>法電工人昨又怠工　各路車輛均停駛　因待遇不平等引起糾紛當局竭力調停早日復工</h3>
<p>法商水電公司工人要求增加津貼、經推代表會同法捕房政治部向公司交涉、公司大班允考慮後十日以前答復、車務等工人認爲公司無誠意接受、於昨日下午三時三十分、相率自動怠工、所有各路電車·公共汽車·完全停駛、一部份拋錨、停於各馬路旁、旋經公司設法駛入盧家灣工廠、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>中外職工待遇兩歧</p>
<p>法商水電公司自八月一日起、對電燈·自來水·電車·公共汽車一律增價後、並接受職工之請求、普加津貼、宣佈工人之津貼增加百分之十五、但華籍職工因公司內西籍職工、一律加薪百分之五十、何得厚彼薄此、故引起不滿、堅决要求同等待遇、資方迄無相當答復、致勞方已有再度怠工之傾向、昨日午後、由法捕房治部會同工人代表、與公司大班協商、公司對工人之要求、允考慮後於八月十日以前答復、惟車務等工人、認爲不滿意、於下午三時三十分、宣佈怠工、</p>
<p>工人怠工車輛全停</p>
<p>工人自動怠工後、所有行駛法租界內之有軌電車·無軌電車·公共汽車、相率停駛或駛入盧家灣工廠、或拋錨停於各馬路旁、公司得悉工人怠工後、即請法捕房派中西探捕、駐守盧家灣工廠四週及公司門首、並由西籍職工設法將各車輛拖至廠內、因此昨日下午四時後、法租界一·二·五·七·十等路有軌雷車、十七·十八·二十四路無軌雷車、二十一及二十二路公共汽車、完全停駛、</p>
<p>各方勸告卽解決</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、法捕房政治部等、頃已囑工人代表勸告工人尅日復工、以維交通、靜待公司八月十日以前答復、並負責設法調處、因公司對工人之要求與外筆職員同樣增加津貼百分之五十一層、並不堅決拒絕、况已允考慮後答復、聞至昨晚截止、工人對先行復工問題、尚未允許、但預料此决怠工風潮不致擴大、短期內或有解決希望、因爭執之點、並不十分嚴重、</p>
<p>英電車停入法租界</p>
<p>英商上海雷車公司之五路有軌電車、以及十七·十八·二十四路無軌電車、向有公共租界與法租界互相通車之辦法、自法商水電公司工人怠工後、以上各路車輛、耶中止駛法租界、五路有軌電車駛至東新橋爲止、十七·十八路無軌電車駛至大世界掉頭、廿四路無軌電車駛至西摩路福煦路口爲止、法租界境內自電車公共汽車停駛後人力車莫不利市三倍、市民深感不便、</p>
<h3>日軍搜查南市　抄獲軍火</h3>
<p>南市鐵門自遭封鎖後、迄至昨日、形勢始略告鬆弛、日方已將新開河救火會旁之鐵絲網開一小道、准許婦孺出外、但仍絕對禁止在民國路上通行、規定凡欲往租界者、須繞道自新開河自來水亭子對過之觀音閣街、斜越穿過民國路、至該鐵絲網缺口處外出、但壯齡靑年、則除有日方之特別證明書外、仍無法出外、至於日軍連日在南市難民區內嚴密搜查、被認爲嫌疑而遭逮捕者、爲數殊多、外傳前日在城隍廟附近之某屋中、曾被破獲一機關、抄出手溜彈及槍械甚夥、昨日起居戶所裝電話、均告不通云、又另據消息、此項搜查工作、明日可告完竣、鐵門亦有開放可能、但亦無從證實、叉據昨由南市出來之人告稱、南市封鎖四日、食量已大告缺乏、食米漲至每升三元、尚無買處、大餅每隻四角、蔬菜因來源斷絕、無從購買、猪肉尚有應市、每斤須售六元、致近日南市居民、奐不叫苦連天、</p>
<h3>正當商人申請外匯　辦法異常嚴密　須信譽可靠並詳述用途經過審核始付外滙支票　英政府已授權匯豐等三銀行辦理</h3>
<p>自美國於上月二十五日宣佈凍結中日二國資金後、美財政部即發出二種照會、一特許夏威夷及菲列濱維持對中日間正常貿易關係、一授權上海十四家外商銀行、供給外滙、維持中國對美國·南美洲·英帝國·蘇聯荷印之正常賀易、辦法規定在第五十八及五十九號一般照會中、自可有所遵循、英國則僅下令凡中國或中國以外之分行、將所有英鎊存款僓券現金、不分中外、悉予封存、杜其栘動、雖說明對中國及英鎊集團間之進出口貿易、仍予維持、但未詳示辦法、英商銀行乃紛去電倫敦、有所請示、據大中社記者探悉、此項覆電、業已於昨日抵滬、英政府巳授　滙豐·麥加利·有利、三英商銀行、辦理申請供給外滙事宜、茲分誌昨日所得各項消息於後、</p>
<p>申請規定甚為周密</p>
<p>關於申　外滙辦法、美國方面之規定、其要點爲（一）必需爲善意的進出口貿易、（二）限制申請者、必爲在今年三月十四日以前在中國經營進出口之中外人民、（三）申請供給之外滙、應與其進出口貿易價値相等現下所有外商銀行、對有人申請供給美滙、即依上述原則辦理、至中請供給英鎊辦法、覆電已於昨日扺滬、電文未公佈、據滙豐銀行高級職員透露消息、爲英政府已授權滙豐·麥加利·有利·三英商銀行對向在上述三行立戶之商人、其信用行爲、必需經三銀行經理認爲可靠者、可向三行供給外櫃、在申請書中、須詳細載明付給何地何行、購辦何種貨物、需要數目、送請三行審核、經三行經理核准後、然後付以外滙支票、准其動用、辦法甚爲審愼嚴密、</p>
<p>英僑准提生活費用</p>
<p>此外、英政府所宣佈之凍結令，對凡中國或中國以外之分行、限令娘將所有英　存款債券現金、不分國籍、全部予以封存、遂致英僑資金、亦被凍結在內、無法支取、使彼等於最低限度之生活費用及其他正當用途、亦不可得、各銀行循英僑請求、亦曾雷倫教請示辦法、予以改善、在昨日覆電中、英政府是吾已有辦法指示、記者尚米能證實、僅知滙豐銀行鑒於恃存款爲生者之苦衷、經妥善考慮後、業已將絲毫不得動用之辦法、予以變更、即對英僑存戶、已允許支取三鎊五鎊小額款項、充暫時生活費用、若超過此等數目、則碍難核准、</p>
<p>對滬輸出勢必減少</p>
<p>至英美銀行、自凍結令實施後、對外滙已不能自由供給、於本市對外貿易、自不無相當影響、某英商銀行高級職員曾對記者談及一顯著之自然現象、認英美兩國、勢將减少對滬輸出、據稱、目下本市各外商銀行、均已拒絕承做押滙、如某商人擬以貨物一萬元、輸往國外、往昔僅須向銀行付以貨値三分之一之外滙、即可裝輪出口、其後押滙增加至二分之一、目下則更增至百分之百、即一萬元之貨物、非先付以一萬元之外滙不可、此舉目的、顯在預防貨物運至中途、航路中斷、或因時局變動而發生其他影響、</p>
<h3>虹口日軍轄境　發現天花</h3>
<p>本市入夏以來、天時不正、雖近日酷暑、已入正軌、惟七月下旬、霪雨霏霏、連日爽凉、宛若秋天、蓋因氣候忽凉忽熱、忽睛忽雨、致時疫猖獗、據悉楊樹浦於前日、叉發現天然痘、患者名金井政吉、年三十餘歲、朝鮮人、居住楊樹浦元芳路麥克脫路二二六號、經醫診斷、決定其為天然痘時疫、乃送同仁會八字橋醫院醫治、日軍乃將該處附近一帶封鎖、斷絕交通、施行大消毒、並將住居該處之華日居民、約二百餘人、均施行臨時種痘、以資預防、</p>
<h3>旅華英僑　籌款購機</h3>
<p>旅華英僑近曾籌募巨款、獻呈政府、購機一隊、編入英空軍、名爲「僑華英人機隊」、茲英僑方面定於八月十五日前募足英金二十萬鎊、以便續購第二隊「僑華英人機隊」、增强英空軍之實力、</p>
<h3>法租界米糧評委會　開會檢討米市　議決維持洋米原定價格</h3>
<p>法租界米糧評價委員會、對於滬市整個民食、深切關懷、鑒於此决米價之上升、純係投機米商惡意佈謠、操縱壟斷所致、該會不忍坐視、爰於上月二十八日邀集米業·煤業·牛羊業·華洋雜貨業·醬園業·鮮肉業等業負責代表、籌商穩定民食及抑平各種物品售價事宜、後經討論結果、當塲評定四種洋米標準售價、並飭令全市米號一體遵行、該會爲檢討已評定之米價是吾適合標準起見、復於昨日下午三時三十分、邀集上述各業負責代表、籌商繼續抑平米價、計出席者有米號業。煤業·華洋雜貨業等代表十餘人、法公董局華文秘書朱一桂亦參加列席、主席仍由維納担任、商業結果、已評價之四種洋米仍照原價、即一號西貢（石計一百六十市斤）一百一十六、（二）二號西貢一百十九元、（三）平價小絞米一百十六元、（四）一·二號西貢混合碎米八十九元、</p>
<h3>英美應採嚴峻行動　使泰國守望中立　並予以保護及經濟便利挽救泰國時機稍縱卽逝</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報昨刊伍德海氏評論、暢論泰國所受日方之威脅稱、苟欲挽救泰國免遭與法屬越南同樣之命運、各民洽國務必立刻採取嚴峻行動、目須互相調整、始能奏效、傳聞日方刻向泰國强索者、實際上等於獨佔其貿易、而爲要求利用泰境陸空軍根據地之先聲、</p>
<p>緊急控制鉅額貸款</p>
<p>傳日本向此方面推進之最先行動、爲已向泰國銀行團獲得信用借款達泰幣一千萬枚、的合一千六百萬日元、以一小國貸此款予他國、數可謂鉅甚、允因民治國若盡最大的可能範國、實施近所宣布之經濟報復、則借款之國、有經濟毀滅之虞爲然也、抑日方此舉、必須視爲在經濟上與政治上控制泰國之第一步</p>
<p>續以土地割讓泰國</p>
<p>明顯行動、據近電所傳、日方此後行動、所將採取之方式、爲續以越南領土割讓泰國、速著名安格科古跡地亦在割讓之例、以易取泰政府之簽訂協定、准許日方在泰境設陸空根據地、此與日政府於泰越邊界協定簽字時所發之保證及其上週向維希（與英大使）所發之諾言、當然牴牾、蓋日方曾於三月十一日泰越邊界協定簽字時保證協定條款爲「確定不易」者、並向維希擔保日本當嚴格履行其尊重越南土地與主權完整之義務然安格科固在三月間商定的割讓地之外也</p>
<p>須予荷印切實保證</p>
<p>民治國可用以阻制日方侵入泰國之辦法有數端、其一必須加緊向日本所施之直接壓力、而聲明非待日本棄其對泰作政治上或經濟上侵略之任何意響、則實施經濟報復、決無絲毫伸縮性、關於此點、英美爲易取荷印之誠摯合作計、似須予荷印以切實保證、而使荷印不稍懷疑於英美、若對日本或日方控制區完全禁運、致日方威脅或竟攻擊荷印時、英美必取對付行動、且英美苟非保證予荷印以保護、實不應使荷印成爲對日報復先鋒、</p>
<p>英美對泰向極友好</p>
<p>再英美務須擬定對泰國本身之確定政策、英笑政府對泰國之關係、迄今向頗友好、而以互信爲基礎、凡消息靈通之泰國人士、無有懷疑英美對泰藏何侵略意嚮者、英方在泰國邊陲附近從事軍事戒備，曾通知泰政府、並說明理由、從盤谷出發之泰方軍事團、甫於數日前受英方之歡迎、並參觀防務區域、盤谷方面報紙日前且以英方在馬來與緬甸所施辦法及日方在越南之行動作對比、而對英方加以好評、</p>
<p>英國准許石油輸泰</p>
<p>兩月之前、英方准許石油產物從英屬地輸入泰國、按分用、此可證明英方關切泰國福利、泰國不得英荷合作、即不能獲得石油之接濟、英美今應立刻聲明泰政府若作危害英美利益之讓步、即無石油可得、日本處境、固無力以石油供給泰國也、實際上英美荷禁運石油、而使之眞正奏效、則越南境內日方陸海空軍所需汽油與石油產物、皆須從日本運往、而使日方之存底枯竭、</p>
<p>所希望者嚴守中立</p>
<p>又有須予闡明者、泰國若成日方繼續侵峪之根據地、則英美荷對日本資金所頒凍結令、將以同樣嚴峻程度、施諸泰國、但英美之行動、不得專恃威脅、更應保證泰國若守嚴格中立之政策、必予以經濟上與金融上便利、並加保護、英美國不欲使泰國對日起糾紛、蓋所望於泰國者、厥爲中立、而非積極合作也、泰國若拒不讓步、以免被用以攻擊遠東英荷或美國之屬地、則英美亟應保證其領土完整與經濟自主、毫無猶豫、蓋欲挽救泰國、免成所謂「大東亞新秩序」之其决遭殃者、時機不容稍失也、</p>

<p>滬戰第四週年將屆、本市各界民衆、以滬市環境特殊、故對此偉大神聖之紀念、決不舖張紀念儀式、但爲表示對抗建信念之堅決、及悼念死難將士及同胞起見、故經各團體公決於是日全市停止娛樂突會並茹素一天、並於正午各就原位起立靜默悼念、同時決加緊推動獻金救難運動、以堅決行動、作沉着紀念、</p>

<p>本市照相業全體共有一百五六十家、營業大小及藝術　低、至爲不齊、雇有職工一千二百餘人、工資每月自三五十元至二百餘兀、亦不一律、最近由體全職工組織職工會、向店方</p>

<p>昨洋米到多銷細、人心異常軟弱、蓋存底旣日益加增而來源又絡繹不絕、轉口旣無暢化、本街又有平價港米供應、且匯縮產劃、人心更虛、開市後期現兩米一致下游、雖値週一本客添辦之際、而各戶納胃極呆、故開價已見下游、英華司允見不振、小絞路貨祇一百四十八元二角、二號暹邏祇一百四下元、碎米一百〇四五元、均比上週六小去二三元、亦無大戶整化、統市紙開五百多噸、現米均被帶小一二元、成交的有一萬多包、收盤、一號曲貢高自百卅三元半、百卅三元、决至百廿八元、二號百廿二元牛、百廿三元、一號暹邏百廿七元、二號百廿元〇五角、次至百十八元、敏黨高自百卅一元决至百廿五元、茄佛米百廿八元半百廿八元、小絞銀行棧自百廿二元半至百廿一元、外棧自百廿一元至百廿元、次百十九元、東京　尖特別百十七元半、百十六元、米茶自十一元、碎尖特自九十五元半、决至八十九元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳昨則復以到貨轉旺、人心回軟、蓋時値暑令、貨易變化、不耐擱置、致貨主售意頓鬆、今時一般作客、亦以，此理不敢多辦、銷塲並懈、於是在出多進少之局面、厚薄兩粳行悄均難維持、以南港早晚稻身骨軟弱、貨又較多、貶短計二元有奇、開百五十三元至百五十一元、無錫原包白粳則僅降元砠、開百四十六元、至百四十二元、</p>

<p>五日出口、有豆子四百九十五包運香港、豆餅二千二百四十塊運香港、</p>

<p>雙馬晨開、因美棉大漲、人心良好、首緊價爲千五百七十元、少頃漲至一千五百七十六元、繼聞粤幫交易並未十分旺盛、同時　言申新廠有大量的開出、致人心軟化、空頭叉復活動而向下、降至一千五百五十四元、但取引所行市堅挺、有一部份復來收進幾包、市盤又回昻至一千五百六十三元收盤、查午日間成交統計七千三百六十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、同行七、〇〇〇香港三六五統　七、三六五</p>
<p>金燮馬期紗市况、晨初開　因美棉　風變本加厲、金號與證券商在近期購進、八月漲五元、允月漲一元、十月則以多頭猶在出籠、忽跌五元、入後以外滙與金價無甚特殊、港銷欠發展、近月多頭了結鬆動有掉進遠期者、市價近鬆而遠回、午收八月漲一元、九月漲一元半、十月漲半元、成交五千三百五十包、後市初開近疲遠堅、入後因傳某方有接收法院之說、新買與補空車振、八月期度高至一千四白五十五元、九月期一千五百三十元、十月期一千五百叫十九元、漸略回、晚收結果、八月期比上星期六漲八元、九月期漲十九元、十月期漲二十三元、金日共成交一萬二千百三十包、比上日增加七千五百八十包、再將全日開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>

<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續趨漲、且較前爲銳、大槪人一二家補空、乃有二三家以爲有機可乘、隨勢買進、市價乃爲之抬高、丙種居然抬出七元、內空頭而抵補所致、其繼續上漲、亦無甚理由、而其隱　、則仍尚無袪除樂觀、昨上午生大公成德昌買進、久豐潤德聯和及聯益賣出、午收市價即好四五角、午後協興元同康買進、鴻大益昌乘機吸收、聯益補回、久豐潤德聯和三家繼續斬結、生大轉賣、怡泰趁勢出脫、丙種抬出七元、市上求過於供、結果一致續漲五角至九角半之多、成交的二百五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>呢羢襯裏節節高</h3>
<p>呢羢裏子襯頭之類、如絲光羽紗、馬鬃袖裏·花洋布·法西襯·黑灰襯·軟襯等、新近復又上漲、因原料缺貴、廠方開支浩大、成本提昻、且織造者小若前之夥、買方咸有問津故耳，昨大同蠟綫絲光羽紗、每碼批沽二元八角、陳和慶蠟紗二元二三角、雜牌决號貨爲元算、普通絲織馬鬃袖裹售三元八九角、紗織三元二角半、花洋布頭號二元四角、二號永成牌子二元、洪盛法西襯一元九角、寅豐一四七〇爲一元七角、大業一元五角、源記盛一元、黑灰襯全毛七元半至八元、　紗二元二三角、紗毛五六元不等、寅豐星牌子四元二角半、公平太極圖軟襯一元八角、洪盛二元一角、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>人生價值</h3>
<p>— 簫雲</p>
<p>因爲文藝作品，戲劇，與電影有病態與健全之分，有麻醉與淸醒之分，有有毒與無毒之分，所以我們此後對於文藝，戲劇或電影的評價，除了看它的藝術價値以外，還要看它的人生價値。不，我們應該在不忽略藝術價値的原則下，把人生價值看在藝術價值之上。我們把人生價值罷在前面，因爲我們是先有人生而後有藝術的。</p>
<p>這樣，我們對於讀物的選擇，就有一個準則可循了。</p>
<p>使靑年沉溺在夢幻的，虛無的，空想的，消極的境地中的讀物，無疑地是有毒素的。它所灌輸給靑年的，是一種逃避的，退化的，保持現狀的，歪曲的，低級趣味的思想，使他們失去生之勇氣，不敢面向現實。</p>
<p>有益的進步讀物，雖然不全是關於光明面的譽揚，也有不少是關於醜惡的描寫與暴露的，但是在字句之中，言外之意，無形中表現出一種深惡痛絕的含意，使請者都能體會其用意，腦中豁然開朗，在現實的世界中更能積極奮鬥，按着書中的暗示走上正路。</p>
<p>當然，這種精神上的毒質或補品，紙能够用體會的方法去分辨與抉擇。把分辨毒素的或衛生的讀物的責任放在靑年身上是不應該的。這責任是要由文藝作家與書評家肩負起來去加倍努力的。</p>

<h3>國防聲中的代替品</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>美國現在爲了要讓國防工業獲得足够的物料起見，也在勵行節的各種金屬，橡皮，絲，軟木與某幾種木材了。但是一般的消費者郤用不到恐慌，因爲政府與私人機關同時都在竭力發明代替品。</p>
<p>有一種所謂『黏土』（Ｐlastics）工業，如今幾乎已經發展得非常成功。從前一部或全部必須以鉛，鎂，錫，鉻與鋅製造的金屬機件，目前差不多都被道種『黏土』代替了過來。無論是風扇葉子，照相機，粉匣子或飛機另件都能够用『黏土』來做成。據製造冰箱與汽車的各工廠宣稱：『黏土』這東西對於它們的用處亦大得驚人。福特汽車公司中的那些硏究員則還在作更大的努力，希望使『黏士』在國防上能够有更多的貢獻。許多人都相信，在不久的將來，飛機上的翼子也可以用『黏土』製造，以省下大量的鋁與不銹鋼，來用在別種需要的地方。</p>
<p>人造的樹脂琺瑯（ＲesinＥnameL）已被人們廣泛地用作製造洋鐵罐頭的主要原料了。據美國利學學院的估計，每年從舊的洋鐵罐頭中至少可以提煉出一萬二千噸的新錫來。所以，凡是當家的女子，現在都叫她們儘可能地不要將舊罐頭拋棄掉。</p>
<p>華盛頓地方有一個由冶金學專家組織成功的生產管理局，其最大的目的，就在於研究怎樣來製造國防上所需要的各種金屬的代替品。他們最着重於鋁與鎂的節省；其他則尚包括錫，鎢與鉛片等等幾種。</p>
<p>人造橡皮與銅也引起了人們很大的注意。橡皮在美國的產量原極少，但是需要郤特別來得多。據實地試用的結果，人造橡皮並不比天然的產品壞，如今最大的問題祇是不能大量地生產。</p>
<p>『尼侖』（Ｎylon，這久已熱悉了的人造絲，乃是眞絲的絕好替代品。目前正有許多人在埋頭研究如何用它來製造降落傘。</p>
<p>最近，美國的惠斯汀好渥斯電氣公司叉聲稱：它們已發現了一種新的所謂『磁鋼』（Ｍagnetic　Ｓteel），可用以代替鋼與銅的需要。鋼與銅原都是製造槍彈的原料，這樣一來，簡直就像替國防上建立了一個非常大的功勞。</p>
<p>在上次歐戰中，我們曾得到了許多代替品；那麽在這决大戰中，無疑的，我們也將看到大量新奇的東西。讀者們祇要等着瞧，我這句話決不是瞎說的。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>我是職業輸血人</h3>
<p>— 允夷</p>
<p>在生活指數步步高漲的威脅下，我終於也被迫而出賣自己的心血了，並且還是一個職業輸血者呢！一年來輸血結果，雖然得以塡飽了肚子，但在對鏡自照時，啊！我實在不禁驚駭地叫起來。往日强健的體魄，豐滿的臉龐，炯炯的目光，現在鏡中顯出的影子，竟前後判若兩人。强健的已經變成瘦弱，豐滿的也就這麼淸癯，而那平素炯炯有神的眼呢？同時也給蒙罩上一層灰枯的色彩，已近似一具活屍　但是，為着要生活下去，總還得掙扎着一點殘餘的喘息，負起本位的責任來，拯救那比我更貧血，更危險的一般病家，直至輸完我自身最後的一滴血爲止。</p>
<p>然而我的輸血却和旁人不同，就是事前不必經過醫師檢騐血型的手續，祇須將自已平日抽取的血液，賣給一般醫師們，以供他們隨時爲病家注射。</p>
<p>我的血液就是藍墨水，自來水筆，當然等於抽取血液的封筒了，當我將一支銳利筆尖，放進藍墨水瓶時，正好像針頭刺入了血管一樣，雖則暫時感覺着一陣心痛，但是當想到將我的血液能去拯救一個貧血的同胞時，我的心終於又霍然而安了。</p>
<p>不過輸血的酬報，是相當低微的，然而還會常常遭到一般勢利醫生——刊物和報館的編輯——的摧殘。在他們的貿然拋棄之下，於是一次，二次，……都作了無謂的犧牲。可是我畢竟祇是一個弱小的輸血者，對於道類的手段，叉有什麽辦法呢？除了暗暗痛惜自己被毀的心血之外，但是依舊還要在人前裝出苦笑，表示虛偽的安閑，掩蓋內在的痛苦！</p>
<p>有時經過長時間的抽血之後，對於這已經瘦弱的身體，更覺得萎頓不堆，往往跌撲在床上，就好比暈了過去一般，但叉不會就這麼安穩地睡去，倒是雞啼成了我的催眠鐘，祗有破曉的一刹那，才是我稍得恢復疲勞的寳貴時間。</p>
<p>我每天都是在這般「欲哭强笑」的極端矛盾情形中討生活。但是，如果在這全市來仔細調查一下，必定還有不少和我一樣的同業，也在這種勢利的醫生手腕下，度着慘痛的生活呢！（移費捐助學金）</p>
<h3>溫度調節床褥</h3>
<p>— 增修</p>
<p>據紐的科學圖畫雜誌的消息，發明家最近創造了一種裝有溫度調節設備的床褥。這件消息眞是喜歡高枕而臥者的福音。那種床褥的內部，有一種新奇的裝置，能够保持恒溫，所以冬暖夏凉，使在床上睡淸的人遍體舒適。睡廣的人的身體，被那種褥子裹住一半，直到腰部爲止，不論冬夏，決無過熱過冷之弊。控制瘟度調節器的機關裏面，有一種利用電力的機件，牠的作用止和電鐘，無綫電收音機，烘麵包器和電爐盤裏面的同類機件相似。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「爸爸！爸爸！我冉也不敢了！你饒了我這一次吧！」還虧梅寶搶在他的面前，立刻跪在地上，用力抱住了他那兩條病後始終還小曾恢復原狀的雙腿，噙着滿眶淸淚，一邊哭一邊袁求着。「好爸爸！我眞沒有想到會把你氣得這種模樣，你的病還沒有好全，求你別跟我鬧得太認眞了！明兒要是我再去學戲，憑你打死我也不怨……。」</p>
<p>梅寳這一陣大哭大喊，才把秋海棠的理智漸漸喚醒了過來。</p>
<p>「爸爸，好爸爸，快坐下去歇息一會吧！今天起，我再也不上孟家去了！」梅寳跪在地上，繼續哽咽着說。</p>
<p>理智雖然已漸漸恢復了，但燒遍了全身的怒火，一時却還不容易就壓平下去；秋海棠低下頭來，睜大着一雙眸子，看在梅寳那一張涕淚縱橫的臉上，半響不說一句話。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你還不肯饒我嗎？我的意思原想學會了戲，將來的日子咱們可以過得比較舒服些。旣然爸爸小要我去學，那還不是很容易的事，只要我不去就行了！好在師傳要我寫字據……」</p>
<p>「寫字據？」秋海棠的眼睛睜得更大了，一種又慌急，又害怕的神情，充分地流露出來。</p>
<p>「不，爸爸，沒有寫咧！」梅寳一面用衣袖拭去臉上的淚水，一面來不及的回答。「尚家的舅公原說道一張紙必須要你出面寫的，所以一直躭擱到現在。」（一七六）</p>

<h3>宋雅海妮嫁後重登銀幕</h3>
<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>「溜冰皇后」宋雅海妮自以「鳳舞銀冰」「片躍登銀壇後，因爲她的溜冰玩意兒精湛美妙，所以風靡影城，而她的銀幕事業，也就一帆風順了。一九三八年榮列「十大賣座明星」之第三位，僅次於秀蘭鄧波兒與克拉克蓋博。在她最初的「鳳舞銀冰」，「銀色舞后」，「冰雪驚鴻」三部作品裏；都是以瑰麗偉大的溜冰塲面爲主要的，而情節與結構則比較屬於决要，因此在觀衆方面，未免感到要有換換口味的必要。宋雅海妮本人和公司當局有鑒於此，所以她的第四部作品「夜開花」，却和已往諸作不同，換句話說：「夜開花」因戲情的緊凑與結構的精巧，在演出形式上是已超過已往任何片子了。然而賣座仍未見起色，同時宋雅海妮也以下嫁紐的靑年富翁譚托平而傳播一時。</p>
<p>今有消息傳來，宋雅海妮婚後決定繼續從影，不過她表示要是她的前途萬一有不順利的話，那時她決定脫離水銀燈。現在她的新作已在開始拍攝中，名爲“Ｓun　Ｖal　ley”世紀福斯公司爲了這張片子化了五萬美金，建設一個滑冰塲，供她練習，她的滑冰裝已變成和浴衣相似的服裝，宋雅海妮說：「我發現這種緊身的衣服，使我滑起冰來更爲舒服，可以增加我一倍的速率。」在這張片子裹，宋雅海妮除貢獻溜冰技藝外，並將唱一支歌曲，而滑冰的地板也由銀白色的改爲新頴別緻的黑色地板，本片是宋雅海妮婚後改變風格的作品，我們等着瞧吧！</p>

<p>先由包君幼蝶唱鐵鏡公主搖板及倒板慢板，余與師善操社，幼蝶嗓音淸脆如昔，且具裂音，不同凡響。師善二胡亦　絲入扣，繼由周東山唱春秋　原板，操琴者爲南京胡琴票友王汝霖，幼蝶和以二胡，工穩可喜。繼唱頭本太眞外傳，則爲陸君聚生，奏琴由聞克立與朱慶觥兩君合作，而朱君之二胡，手音特別響亮，而又毫無火氣。聞君胡琴亦包腔嚴密，聆之殊爲過癮。再次爲黎寳蓀歌生死恨，由其老搭擋朱氏昆仲為之，二人弓子同起同落嚴如王徐，殊不易易、實蓀藝事近來猛進不已，扮相之佳，身材適合，票界一致公認。所機憾者，即唱腔方面，深受荀氏影響，未能純照梅法耳。此會自二時半開始，直至七時半始已，如此盛暑，而諸君子且唱且拉，從無一人有道「熱」之一字者，可見雅興之不淺矣。是日淸唱均爲靑衣，老生殊屬寥寥，座中有善謔者，謂爲陰盛陽衰，聞之乃爲軒渠不置。更有一事，余頗引爲恨事者，即梅派名票祭酒楊君畹農，遠在陪都，未能參加，及近在咫尺之胡琴名宿倪秋萍氏，與得梅親授之沈君柏年，均未蒞臨，斯爲美中不足耳。</p>

<h3>對女子越劇的今昔（下）</h3>
<p>— 錦濤</p>
<p>除了優點以外，我認爲也有幾種弱點。——至少是美中不足——我是紹興人，我愛紹興，我更想幫助越劇界，把它寫下來，希望前臺後臺，大家注意改進。</p>
<p>（一）調子</p>
<p>唱的調子太簡單，缺少變化，兩三句短句後，接着來一句長句，長句的末尾，總是一個「Ａ」的聲音。這樣聽的人好像在聽宣卷，懂是容易懂的，不過聽久了，會得感覺乏味，疲倦。——調子竟不及申曲的有變化——我的意見是需要增加改變，轉腔，換調，使它活潑，生動，詞句，口氣，不妨保持鄉音，腔調儘量可以抄襲，一如皮簧的包含梆子，崑腔……冶衆長於一爐，是好事，不是壞事。</p>
<p>（二）穿插</p>
<p>有幾處地方，對唱對白太多，唱的人吃力，聽的人掃興。像「盤夫」一戲，就是一個例子，二三個人，竟唱到一小時以上，眞太沉悶，這種地方，編劇的應該利用聰明，穿揷一些輕鬆的動作，抓住聽衆的注意力和興趣。</p>
<p>（三）其他</p>
<p>臺幔自從平劇界的梅蘭芳自備以來，一般名伶，羣起仿效，這原未可厚非，不過花絞不要太俗，像做喜事的禮堂一樣。一樣的繡花，一樣的出錢，索性請美衛家設計，畫張圖案，色彩不要太多，圖案以大方簡單爲主，掛起來那多美呢？——桌圍椅披等多須改良，其餘像「男女一之事，千萬不要表演得近於誨淫，這些地方，是有方法避免直接演出的。講到前臺，雖然不是越劇根本問題，但也很有關係，女子越劇的「唱」，調門是不高的，看的人如果不能靜，那便影響到戲劇，所以頂好是小孩也要買票，而且不論手抱嬰孩，也須全票，這樣無知識的僕人是少帶了；要哭的囝是沒有了；全塲肅靜，唱詞句句送人耳鼓，容易使人發生好感，可以吸收不少的周郞。還有臺上燈光，可仿話劇塲成法，戲一開塲，前臺的燈，除太平門和厠所外面的幾隻外，一律關熄。這樣觀衆的目力不傷，而且可以幫助「靜」的實施。</p>
<p>（編者按）錦濤先生對越劇的現狀和改進的意見，說得切實而透澈，眞是難得的具體辦法。我們爲愛護越劇的前途，希望越劇從業員與編劇導演諸君，加以深切的注意。</p>

<h3>Australian Naval Minister Hughes Announces: British Fleet Will Increase Defense of the Far East to Effectively Defend in Case of Emergency – Direct Warning to Japan Against Further Southern Advance</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 4th – Australian Naval Minister Hughes stated yesterday that the aid provided by the United States to Britain would allow Britain to send its fleet to the Pacific when needed. Minister of Land Forces, Spender, stated that Australians must prepare for imminent danger and that Australia must reach its maximum military strength as soon as possible. The increase in Australia's military efficiency over the past three to four months is a clear demonstration of Australia's intent. Troops are now ready all day and can all depart at any time. Australia has adopted important plans to deal with serious situations. However, there is still a lot of frivolity throughout Australia. When the dark clouds gradually gather, we should stop entertaining ourselves. Foreign Minister Stewart also spoke to correct the impression in some quarters that Australia was not as actively involved in economic restrictions against Japan as other self-governing dominions, stating that since 1936, there had been no commercial treaty between Australia and Japan, only trade arrangements, so there was no need for formal communication.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 4th – Australian Naval Minister Hughes' declaration that Britain could dispatch a fleet to the Pacific if necessary has caused great excitement here. All parties expect the effectiveness of Britain in dealing with Japanese aggression, which has been greatly diminished due to the lack of a strong British fleet in the Pacific. Although it is generally believed that the United States will send its fleet to join any conflict in the Pacific in the event of a confrontation with Japan, the news that the British fleet can also participate will undoubtedly have a more reassuring effect. Anyone knows that it will take some time for Britain to send a fleet to the Far East, but all believe that the strong British military power now in the Far East can provide effective defense in any emergency, pending the arrival of the fleet. It is expected that after the British fleet arrives, Britain's attitude in this part of the world will quickly change from defensive to offensive. Chinese sources here frankly admit to being deeply impressed by this firm expression from Britain. According to a prominent Chinese person speaking to a Reuters reporter, Britain has unhesitatingly imposed sanctions on Japan due to the Vietnam issue. Now that Japan has begun to threaten Thailand, Britain has made the above declaration, which can be regarded as a direct threat to Japan against further advances.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 4th – A team of elite soldiers selected from British and Australian troops stationed in Malaya arrived in Rangoon yesterday for forest warfare training. This team will train in Burma with newly organized independent units, enabling them to conduct lightning strikes in enemy territory. The war in Abyssinia has provided a precedent for the successful operation of such independent units. Burma has various terrains suitable for forest warfare training. The arrival of the Malayan elite and the establishment of special training demonstrate the close cooperation of the Eastern Command in defense. When the first batch of Australian soldiers arrived here from Malaya, Lieutenant General Macleod personally boarded the ship to welcome them.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th – Although tensions between the United States and Japan have increased over the past week due to mutual economic retaliation, there are continuous rumors in Tokyo today that the United States and Japan may be engaged in negotiations to establish a compromise in the Far East. It is said that Japan hopes the United States will recognize Japan's position as a leader in the East, and Japan is willing to adopt a more moderate policy towards democratic countries and is willing to cease further aggression. As of now, efforts to establish a compromise between the United States and Japan are only in the exploratory stage. However, what is noteworthy is that Japan does not take the opportunity of the United States freezing Japanese assets to worsen relations between the two countries, but rather adopts a more moderate policy. This can be seen in the essay written by Finance Minister Ogura, stating that Japan is willing to relax the freeze, provided that the United States is willing to act in the same way. It is generally believed here that relations between the United States and Japan have now reached the worst stage in history. However, it is solemnly pointed out that Japan is now at a crossroads and must make a decisive decision, either choosing a final policy that reverses its previous actions, or resolutely joining the Axis powers. It is also pointed out that the current government of Japan is actually composed of retired naval leaders, who have significant business interests and advocate friendship with countries that can trade with Japan, rather than just countries that have political relations with Japan, because Japan cannot obtain any assistance from the latter in times of crisis. Although there have been many hostile reactions here to the United States freezing Japanese assets, the reaction of some people is actually more moderate. Even the reactions that exist are only for domestic interests. If the current reactions are analyzed, it indicates that Japanese public opinion in general is moderate and friendly. One side suggests mutually easing the freeze, while the other side assures the Japanese people that the government is prepared to deal with the consequences of the severance of trade with the United States. The "Hochi Shimbun" wrote in its commentary today, "We have already decided to develop our power peacefully in the south to resist the encirclement of Britain and the United States and to cope with any threats of alliance."</p>
<h3>The US and Japan are Still Bargaining</h3>
<p>The sudden return of Mr. Nomura's advisor from Washington to Japan is generally believed here to be related to Nomura's mediation plan. Authoritative sources point out that if the United States and Japan can carefully explore the possibility of mutual rapprochement, the situation will be very delicate, because both countries are willing to obtain the most favorable position for bargaining. Therefore, it is believed that the United States and Japan will publicize extensively, each claiming that its policies have not changed. In this regard, the general public can divide the policy and diplomacy. The so-called policy in Japan's mind is to establish peace and cooperation in East Asia to avoid the spread of the European war to East Asia. This matter has no fundamental relationship with the Tripartite Pact, but is only an expedient diplomatic measure. A reporter from the "Asahi Shimbun" interviewed Mr. Sumida, the chief military representative sent by Japan to Vietnam. Sumida said that Japan's "East Asia New Order" proposal has been "completed" by concluding a joint defense agreement with Vietnam. This coincides with what some Japanese newspapers have said, that the Vietnam move is to "ensure the safety of Japan's back door," and that Japan will not make further southward aggression. At the same time, the "Kokumin Shimbun" optimistically predicted that Japan has a very good possibility of establishing a new agreement with the Dutch East Indies, at which time Japan can obtain Dutch East Indies oil peacefully. Therefore, the British and American diplomatic circles are extremely concerned about an early rapprochement with Japan. They point out that the consistent tactic of the Axis powers is to announce that they will no longer exert further pressure after each major action. We have good reason to believe that the current economic pressure Japan is suffering should be weighed on its government leaders. From this perspective,</p>
<h3>Japan's Finance Minister Wishes to Negotiate with the US</h3>
<p>As Ogura recently announced in the "Nichinichi Shimbun" to Washington, if the United States can recognize the human and financial resources Japan has spent on establishing the "East Asia New Order," Japan is willing to discuss with the United States. However, he also pointed out that Japan must be compensated for this loss. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Germany's influence in Japan has weakened, because Japan has obviously gradually acted on its own and pursued an independent policy. This is also considered extremely certain by German Ambassador Wirth. Related to this is Germany's sudden "recognition" of the "Nanjing regime," which is quite noteworthy. We can guess that its intention is to appease the Japanese, because the Japanese have always hoped that the Germans would attack Britain, not the Soviet Union. This incident has now forced Japan to stop its economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, creating the recent economic pressure of the joint British and American sanctions against Japan. Hochi Shimbun reporter Muto said that General Nomura intended to improve US-Japan relations, but the result was the opposite. The Americans have reached a conclusion that Japan cannot oppose the United States no matter what. He also said that as the US blockade against Japan becomes increasingly severe, this policy, if continued, could even create a misunderstanding, "believing that we are currying favor." He said, "This is not the success of Nomura's diplomacy. The real reason why the United States does not dare to challenge Japan with force is the lack of preparedness of the US Navy." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" repeatedly focuses on the US-Soviet relations in the Far East, believing that once the US and Soviet Union approach each other and establish a military agreement in the Far East, they will tighten the blockade of Japan. The United States' supply of oil to the Soviet Union is enough to show that Washington has decided to take the Pacific route and no longer cares about Japan's relationship with the Tripartite Pact. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also said that the compensation obtained by the United States for assisting the Soviet Union is to find a base in Kamchatka and take possession of the Aleutian Islands to transport troops to Alaska.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 4th – Washington officials stated that if Japan does not see Germany gain a decisive advantage in the Soviet war by mid-May, it will re-establish friendly relations with the United States. There are two reasons for this view: (1) Japan does not intend to seize oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies at the risk of going to war with democratic countries; (2) The US embargo on gasoline and oil can fatally strike Japan's combat power. For this reason, Japan will soon realize that when the German-Soviet conflict becomes a war of attrition, it will suggest to the United States to ease the oil embargo policy.</p>

<h3>Thailand and Vietnam to Conduct Border Demarcation in Early September</h3>

The Commission will discuss and decide on the specific procedures for border demarcation in August.</p>
<h3>Long Yun Meets with Reporters to Discuss Japan's Recent Movements, Stating that the Recent Occupation of Saigon is in Preparation for its Southern Advance, and it Dares Not Advance North Before the German-Soviet War Reaches a Decisive Stage. If It Invades China, It Will Either Take Kunming Directly or Cut Off the Yunnan-Burma Transportation Route.</h3>
<p>Kunming, July 29 (Airmail) – Recently, the international situation has undergone rapid changes due to the German-Soviet war, and Japan's recent movements have attracted more attention. Long Yun, Director of the Kunming Provisional Headquarters, met with reporters and made a statement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Japan's recent occupation of Saigon is only in preparation for its southward advance, and it will definitely take action soon. In terms of northward advancement, it will definitely not dare to act rashly before the German-Soviet war reaches a decisive stage. It is hoped that the two major democratic countries of Britain and the United States can take advantage of this opportunity to use the combined strength of their navies to give a fatal blow to the ringleader of Far East aggression, so that not only can the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East be ensured, but the peace and order of the Pacific can also rely on this to be stabilized. (2) The Franco-Japanese Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement poses a great threat to us and to Britain and the United States. If the enemy wants to take this opportunity to invade us, regardless of its own strength, and open up a new battlefield in our southwest, its route will undoubtedly be: a) Take Kunming directly; b) Invade Burma from Thailand, and cut off the Yunnan-Burma transportation route in the vicinity of Mandalay. As for the general view that the enemy may directly take XX and other places, (taking action within the western Yunnan border) is an uninformed discussion of geography and terrain, and inevitably involves mobilizing troops and planning afar. If the enemy advances from that road, either invading from Simao to the Lancang River, or circumventing from Jinghong in Thailand, its journey is twice as far as from Hanoi to Kunming. Finally, when reporters inquired about the defense measures against Japanese actions in the Yunnan border recently, Long smiled and said, "Hua Fang had already arranged this matter according to the original plan, but it is related to military affairs, so please forgive me for not answering."

<h3>Sichuan Silk to Be Improved</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese observer suggested today that Sichuan Province is the easiest to develop and make it another source of silk for the United States, to replace Japan. Sichuan is the third largest silk-producing region in China. The reason why it has not been able to achieve an important position in exports in the past is because the quality of Sichuan silk has not reached the standard and American machinery has not been used. Chinese sources say that experts want to improve the silkworm breeds here, which is very easy, and better machines should be used so that the products can meet the needs of the United States.

<h3>US Assistant Secretary of State to Come to the Far East for Investigation, Main Destination Being the Philippines, and Will Also Go to China, the Dutch East Indies, etc.</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 4th – Reliable sources announced today that Assistant Secretary of State Grady will soon be ordered to go to the Far East to study and adjust the pressure exerted by the democratic countries on the Axis powers in the Far East. Grady's mission will focus on the Philippines. Grady will examine the economic situation of the Philippines to determine (1) its possible response when war occurs in the Pacific, (2) its needs in the current situation of ship shortages and reduced export markets, (3) the possibility of saving its economy with agricultural loans and other assistance. Reliable sources know that when Grady inspects the Philippines, he will be assisted by Hayesdegar, the economic advisor to the US High Commissioner in the Philippines, Sayre. The various situations Grady examines will be kept strictly confidential. It is understood that Grady will take a clipper from San Francisco to Manila on August 12, stay there for two weeks, and then go to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Burma, and possibly Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Chongqing. Sources familiar with the situation are extremely cautious about this part of Grady's mission, but said that Grady will definitely discuss with economic experts from various countries, and then compile a list of economic assets and local institutions, as well as prepare to be used when taking specific actions, such as oil embargoes, financial cooperation, or controlled shipping. The same sources announced that the Ministry of Finance has also dispatched banking experts to implement the freeze order and supervise the transactions of Japanese banks in the territory. They will not take action automatically, but, like Grady, will provide factual basis for the United States to take further action when diplomatic policy requires it.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>People in Shanghai Should Cultivate Composure</h3>
<p>In the past ten days, the hearts of the people in Shanghai have been restless again, living in fear as if they could not live through the day. After studying the reasons for this, half of it is due to changes in the situation, and half is due to human causes. The sudden and drastic changes in the situation, such as the Japanese army's occupation of Vietnam and the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the United States and Britain, are all sufficient to trigger a major war in the South Pacific. A single hair can move the whole body, and may affect Shanghai's status, personal safety, and immediate interests. It is inevitable to have doubts and fears, which may still be understandable. However, if it is the shock caused by human beings, it is purely due to speculators stirring up trouble and creating rumors. The strangeness and bizarre nature of the news is something that is impossible in terms of reason, but it is also spread around and broadcast in the city. Often, relying only on private speculation, they rush to speak, and in no time, it becomes a "definite" piece of news. Listeners dare not reject its absurdity, and the speakers themselves also believe that there is a reason for it. So they question each other and then elaborate on it, the more they seek confirmation, the more distorted it becomes. The hearts of the people in society are agitated by it, unable to restrain their emotions, and increase their fears. This kind of man-made shock has a great impact and is extremely harmful. It is certainly pitiful to talk about it, but it is also unforgivable.</p>
<p>I have always had a feeling that the real factor in the restlessness of the people in Shanghai is the lack of composure. Composure means that the heart is focused on one state, immovable, unshakable, able to eliminate chaotic thoughts, and able to overcome difficulties. In short, it means that in any environment, with this composure, one has a consistent thought, a strong will, and is not changed by external things at all. Nowadays, it seems that people in Shanghai cannot easily obtain this kind of composure, and their nerves are abnormally sensitive. Every time a storm comes, not only is there no way to respond, but they also stir up trouble themselves. They often cause some disasters due to unnecessary panic and suspicion. Taking prices as an example, prices were not high at first, but because of worries that there might be a sharp rise one day, they prepared for a month, and now they are accumulating a year's worth of needs. All food, fuel, and daily necessities are rushed to hoard, as a way to solve all problems once and for all. They do not know that with this restless mentality, they are enough to stimulate the rise in prices. Demand loses its balance, and prices soar. And the speculators who hoard goods then add fuel to the fire, so life becomes more expensive day by day, which cannot be stopped, and the common people suffer. All of this is due to the restlessness of the people and the lack of composure.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai's current position, Shanghai's future is indeed worrying, but there are also things that are not worrying. Shanghai is a city with internationality, and its commercial interests are shared by all countries. Not only should the Chinese cherish it, but also the British, Americans, and people from other countries should care about it. Should Shanghai be destroyed one day, it would be an unfortunate event for the Chinese, but would it be a blessing for the British, Americans, and other countries? We infer that Shanghai's status should not be limited to Shanghai itself, but should be viewed from a broader and larger perspective. The greatest desire of those who are generally recognized as plotting against Shanghai lies outside Shanghai. If their plans fail, Shanghai will not be harmed. If their plans succeed, how can Shanghai be spared? Nowadays, the division between the democratic front and the aggressor countries is clear. From the perspective of the democratic countries, what we hope for is the final victory of the democratic front, without having to focus on temporary gains and losses, and temporary peace. Only those who have composure can have this expectation, and can only obtain this final light.</p>
<p>There are also some subtle events that are caused by worry and fear. For example, a certain action may not have had this intention at the beginning, but people speculate wildly, thinking that it will happen one day, and those who like to make a big deal out of things will make various preparations, citing legal principles and criticizing it severely, as if the matter is about to happen imminently. Let us think about it, in this situation, those who have intentions, even if they do not want to take action, it is almost impossible. Thus, rumors that have no basis in fact become reality. "There is nothing wrong in the world, but fools trouble themselves," all due to the restlessness of the people.</p>
<p>We live on an isolated island, living in peace and happiness. Once we think of our compatriots who are displaced and wandering, and we reflect on ourselves in the middle of the night, we feel ashamed and intertwined. If we do not strive to rise up, but worry about our own gains and losses, what is this? Today, there is almost no peaceful land in the world. Seeking absolute safety cannot be achieved by luck, nor can it be achieved by one person or a few people, nor can it be sought by those who are nervous and worried all day long. We must rely on ourselves, rely on our own country, and seek long-term peace and stability, not temporary peace.</p>
<p>Here, I should tell the people of Shanghai that we should engage in cultivating composure and eliminating the mentality of restlessness. The cultivation of composure must start with strengthening our beliefs, because without beliefs, composure cannot be born. If we have strong beliefs, we can set a correct and bright goal, pray for it, and do our best to achieve it. Any difficulties and hardships can be dealt with calmly, and any worries and anxieties can be strongly restrained. Why disturb each other for nothing?</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Guo's Report on the Recent International Situation at the Central Memorial Week: England and the United States Consistently Strengthen the Anti-Aggression Front, Democratic Countries Thoroughly Economically Block Japan, Which Will Inevitably Collapse</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Joint Memorial Week was held on the morning of the 4th. President Chiang presided over the ceremony. After the ritual, Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported in detail on the diplomatic and international situation in the month since taking office. The main points of Minister Guo's report are recorded as follows: "The second major event since I took office was the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, which made the positions of the two democratic and axis camps even clearer: one of aggression and one of anti-aggression. Following this, England and the Soviet Union established a military mutual assistance agreement. Although the Anglo-Soviet agreement is limited to Europe, the British Prime Minister declared in the House of Commons that England and the Soviet Union are in an alliance. The United States also officially announced its active assistance to the Soviet Union and sent a special envoy, Hopkins, to Moscow for consultations. Thus, the Soviet Union, which has been helping our country resist aggression, officially joined the anti-aggression front. The joint front of China, the United States, England, and the Soviet Union can be considered fully established and can work together to strive for victory. In these world changes, Japan has been truly fickle. Its attitude towards England, the United States, and the Soviet Union has changed several times and is self-contradictory. The recent second collapse of the Konoe cabinet showed their embarrassing state of indecision. Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese people have changed six cabinets, while our country has always been under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, implementing its consistent policy with unwavering determination. Now, it is gaining more support, while the Japanese are increasingly isolated and in a difficult situation. The trend of their advantages and disadvantages, success and failure, is now becoming increasingly clear. However, we must pay attention to the fact that the Japanese still want to rely on the Axis powers to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia and carving up the Pacific. After Germany and Italy recognized Nanjing, the President judged that Japan would definitely take a new adventurous move. Sure enough, the Japanese pressured the Vichy government and advanced into Vietnam. Their purpose, in addition to currying favor with Germany and Italy, is to expand the aggression against Vietnam, make the entire territory of Vietnam a Japanese military occupation area, and spy on Thailand, Burma, and our Yunnan. Thirdly, it is to prepare a starting point for threatening Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines in the future. They were confident that bullying the defeated France would not provoke action from England and the United States. Unexpectedly, this speculative move triggered extremely serious repercussions from England and the United States. England and the United States unanimously gave them the most severe economic sanctions. Now, the United States' attitude towards Japan is completely the same as its attitude towards England's enemies, Germany and Italy. The British Empire has also taken parallel steps with the United States towards Japan, further cooperating in the Pacific and strengthening the anti-aggression front. This point is worthy of our attention and gratification. England, the United States, and the Netherlands have already officially announced the deposit of Japanese funds. England and the United States have also, at our country's request, frozen our country's funds in England and the United States to prevent the Japanese from seizing foreign exchange. Recently, the United States announced an embargo on oil to Japan, and the United Kingdom announced the abolition of commercial treaties between various parts of the British Empire and Japan. From now on, Japan will not be able to access these vast markets in India, Australia, New Zealand, overseas colonies, Canada, and South Africa. If China, the United States, England, and the Soviet Union can make the economic blockade of Japan airtight, Japan will inevitably collapse economically. I have been in Europe for nine years and have personally witnessed the detailed process of the changing European situation. I feel that Japan is the main culprit in this worldwide catastrophe. After the previous Great War, countries around the world originally wanted to establish a permanent peaceful order based on the League of Nations. Japan was elected as one of the four permanent members of the council. Unexpectedly, it disregarded the importance of the trust, broke its promises, and took risks. In 1931, it launched an aggression against the three northeastern provinces of our country, first destroying the League of Nations, destroying the League of Nations, the non-war pact, and all international treaties, which led to this world war. From this, it can be proved that Japan is a country without credibility and absolutely cannot bear the responsibility of a first-class country in terms of political morality. In the future, in building a new world order, we must never trust such a country. It has completely lost the qualification to participate in the construction of a new world. At the same time, we see the evolution of the world situation in recent months, and we also deeply feel that Japan is the weakest link in the chain of the aggression group. As long as the democratic countries persist in and strengthen the economic blockade against it, it will soon move towards the path of collapse. The collapse of the Axis front will definitely first manifest in Japan, and the victory of the democratic group will definitely start in the Far East, without a doubt." (4th dispatch)</p>

<h3>England and the Soviet Union to Conduct Large-Scale Joint Operations in the Far North, Large British Naval Contingent Arrives in the Arctic Ocean, Germany Also Prepares for Third Blitzkrieg</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - Finnish newspapers recently reported that England and the Soviet Union may conduct large-scale joint operations in the Arctic Ocean. Responsible parties in London believe that the German High Command is currently preparing for a third decisive blitzkrieg in an attempt to break through the Soviet army's resolute resistance. This is why the Eastern European front has become more stable in the past week. Many believe that the Nazi's third offensive may be a turning point in the war. The current situation is favorable to the Soviet Union, as the Soviet army's lines of communication are now properly maintained, unlike the German army's. The Soviet army only needs to keep its lines of communication intact to be in an advantageous position when the third test comes. As far as the German army is concerned, the deeper it goes into the Soviet Union, the greater its difficulties will be. One thing that can be predicted now is that if the German army's currently planned third blitzkrieg fails, it will be very unsuccessful. When winter comes, it will be inconvenient for the German army to operate, and it will be easily attacked by the Soviet army, which is accustomed to the harsh winter climate of the Soviet Union. At the same time, Finnish newspapers reported that a large British naval contingent has arrived in the Arctic Ocean, and a large Soviet army is also concentrating in the north. This shows that the British air raid on Petsamo was not an accidental attack, but part of a large-scale joint operation plan between England and the Soviet Union in the Nordic regions. According to Finnish news, the activity of the Soviet army on the entire Finnish front is increasing, especially north of Lake Ladoga, where the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked. The Finnish side admits that although Sortavala is under Finnish artillery fire on nearby small islands, it is still in the hands of the Soviet army. The Finnish side believes that the reason why the Soviet army is determined to defend Sortavala is to protect the necessary retreat route through the territory, as transportation on Lake Ladoga is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Red Army Gains Combat Experience, Resistance Grows Stronger</p>
<p>News from Hanko reports little other news except that fresh Soviet troops have arrived one after another. However, the Swiss capital believes that the Soviet army in Estonia is under heavy pressure and is currently retreating to 결戈. Other fronts seem to have few changes, only German sources report that the war is now taking place further east. A Soviet official reviewed the Eastern Front situation in a news report, stating that the struggle of the 　Fascist army has now entered a new stage of fierce battles to determine the battle situation, but it has already shown that Hitler's all-out, one-shot blitzkrieg has been defeated. However, we do not mean that the German Fascist army has been defeated, because the enemy army is still stubborn, and although its manpower and equipment have suffered heavy losses, it is still trying to invade new territories. Our army is calmly responding to the battle, allowing the Fascist tank corps to advance, then cutting off its connection with the infantry, and then thoroughly annihilating the enemy infantry. At the same time, we are using the air force to bomb its 조크 vehicle corps and destroy the enemy paratroopers who have landed. The enemy army has repeatedly used old tricks, attempting to encircle the Red Army units, but the Red Army bravely breaks through the encirclement and uses clever tactics to encircle and annihilate the enemy army instead. The Red Army has learned how to defeat the enemy army, and the strength of our army's resistance is growing stronger day by day, and fresh troops are constantly arriving at the front line, with unusual courage. The news report concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has gained practical combat experience in the forty days of war, and its superior qualities have been further enriched.</p>
<p>German Major Offensive from Arctic Ocean to Black Sea Has Halted</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - A Reuters military commentator said that the Germans themselves have now admitted that the German major offensive against the Soviet Union on the entire front line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea has now halted. It is now impossible to regroup and attack again in a decisive and large-scale manner. German military spokesmen and newspapers have said that the enemy army is not only numerous but also well-equipped, and the news obtained by London from various forces also confirms that the Soviet army is indeed powerful. The German side has now stated the facts. If the military situation is like this, the German army's strategic position in the Soviet Union is very precarious. Hard fighting, long journeys, and various supplies are in short supply, and the treatment of the wounded and dead is also delayed. All of these have a great impact on the German army's combat effectiveness. The German soldiers' escape and surrender to the Soviet side is now common, but in addition to this adversity, there is one thing that is most likely to shake morale, which is the realization of failure. When the army is advancing victoriously and the enemy is crumbling, it can bravely support itself despite all kinds of hardships and losses, because the 滕 army rarely cares about its wounds. But if it fails and the army is hindered, and failure is feared and victory is hopeless, then the fighting spirit will quickly disappear. Therefore, an offensive war that is confident of achieving a great victory, if it ends in failure and suffers many losses, is more likely to shake the support of the army than a defensive war that fails. This fact was seen in Germany's failure twenty-three years ago and will now be discovered again. Soon we will ask, "Can the German army hold out for another month or until winter?" In my opinion, it is almost impossible.</p>
<p>England Prepares to Strike Germany, Land and Air Forces to Launch Expedition in the Spring</p>
<p>The German army has been blocked on all fronts for half a month, and in this half month, fierce battles of a consuming nature have continued. The Soviet army in the far north has indeed driven back its enemy, and the British air raid on Petsamo and Kenks in northern Norway last Friday is indeed meaningful. This is a sign of Britain's close support for the Soviet army in the far north, so there may be developments in the far north in the future. The sea power of the Baltic Sea is still in the hands of the Soviet Union, which often destroys Nazi ships and still guards Hanko, and northern Estonia is still in Soviet hands. The Soviet army is currently engaging in a counterattack in the Smolensk region, but this is only a corner nature. A large-scale general counterattack has not yet been carried out. It will be weeks before a big one can be launched. Its direction is certainly unpredictable, but if a counterattack is launched in the Minsk area, it could achieve extremely decisive results. Judging from the information I have obtained, the Soviet Union still has a large number of well-equipped reserve forces, and the land and air forces stationed in Siberia to defend against Japan have not been calculated in. What will be the future of the Soviet front? It is certainly not possible to say at this time, but before October, it would not be surprising if the German army withdrew from all or part of the front line. Germany can only defend what it can defend in winter, while the Soviet Union will reorganize its large army in winter and prepare for an offensive in the spring. Britain will also prepare to strike Germany in several places on the European continent, and at that time, superior air and land forces will be ready to implement the expedition plan. There has been no act of war against Japan yet, but England and the United States have clearly understood that Japan's strength is far less than that of Germany, and its position is as dangerous as that of Germany. US Vice President Wallace recently said, "Whether there is a chance for peace with Japan now depends only on whether we express it with all kinds of actions and attitudes that we are completely willing to fight." This statement should be our policy towards Japan.</p>
<h3>British Submarine Fires Torpedoes, Bombards Italian Cruiser, One Ship Hit, Whether Sunk or Not Is Uncertain, German Airport on Crete Bombed</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 叫日 - Last night, the Central Navy Public Report stated that yesterday, an Italian cruiser equipped with six-inch guns was torpedoed twice by a British submarine in the Mediterranean. It immediately released smoke to protect itself. Several destroyers were then seen circling the place where the cruiser was hit. As for whether the cruiser sank or not, it could not be confirmed because it was covered by smoke. British submarines in the Mediterranean also torpedoed and sank two supply ships of 6,000 tons and 1,600 tons, less than a mile off the Italian coast, protected by Italian destroyers, and a floating dock towed by two tugboats and two torpedo boats were also attacked by the English submarine. The floating dock was hit by at least one torpedo.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 4th - The British Air Force in the Middle East announced today that on Saturday, a large number of German dive bombers, guarded by fighter planes, attacked British ships off the coast of North Africa. British fighter planes took off to intercept them, shooting down 叫架 enemy bombers and one fighter plane, and severely damaging several enemy planes. Three British fighter planes are missing. On Friday night, British bombers initially bombed enemy-occupied airfields on Crete. After Candia was attacked, there was a violent explosion, followed by a fire, indicating that the gasoline pile had been hit. After Maleimi was attacked, the bombs seemed to have hit an ammunition depot, causing explosions and fires, and thick smoke covered the sky. Also, on Friday morning, British bombers attacked enemy ships off the coast of Lampedusa Island. Two enemy merchant ships, each with a load of 300 tons, were hit by several bombs, and the enemy machine gun positions were also severely attacked. One Italian plane was destroyed and several were severely damaged at the Polizzo airfield in Sicily. Only one British plane that went out to fight did not return.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - According to information from the British Ministry of Aviation, on Saturday, a team of British four-engine and two-engine bombers attacked the center of Berlin and dropped a large number of bombs. The British fleet arrived outside Berlin at 1:30 am and began bombing at 1:94 am. When the British planes circled over Berlin, there were also some German bombers in the sky, so the land defenses could not focus on shooting at the British planes. After the bombs fell, there were three large explosions, and the fire rose like a volcanic eruption. The red light illuminated the sky, and it could still be seen 80 miles away. Hamburg and Kiel in Germany were also heavily attacked, no less than Berlin. Therefore, the battle on Saturday night caused heavy damage to the three major cities of Germany. This is the second time Berlin has been attacked since the British Air Force's summer offensive began.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 叫日 - An Aviation Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday, the British Air Force dispatched to the Strait and the skies of northern France for offensive flights and attacked many enemy targets. Sea patrol boats, land planes, troops, artillery positions, and airfields were all subjected to low-flying strafing and bombing by British planes. Four enemy fighters were shot down, and one British plane did not return.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 叫日 - An Aviation Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday afternoon, a German plane sneaked to a certain place on the southeast coast and dropped bombs, causing slight damage to the area. A British fighter plane shot down an enemy bomber in the skies over the Strait架.</p>
<h3>US Senator George Believes Japan Will Not Attack the Philippines, Japan Plans to Occupy Thailand and Vietnam to Attack British Territories, America Still Hopes to Avoid a Pacific War</h3>
<p>United Press International, 4th - Washington - Retired Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator George, told a United Press reporter yesterday that if Japan takes any action in 赤南 in the future, it will definitely include attacking the滇缅 Highway. Senator George does not believe that Japan will attack the Philippines in the near future. He said, "I have never thought that Japan will attack the Philippines. Their course of action is very clear. They want to occupy Vietnam and Thailand, and then use these sections as bases to attack China or other British territories from the 滇缅 Highway." Joe also said that Japan's determination to occupy Vietnam and its recent decisions all show that it was deeply aware in advance that the United States would take economic retaliation. When Japan made these decisions, it obviously knew what kind of economic pressure the United States would take on Japan. He continued that the United States' policy will continue to be based on the hope of avoiding a Pacific war. He urged everyone to pay attention to the fact that the United States' order to restrict oil exports is not an absolute embargo on Japan, and predicted that after the adjustment of US-Japan relations, if Japan does not make any further aggression, the trade between the two countries will still be based on the pre-war situation, with a small amount of exchanges continuing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Deputy Envoy to the United States Returns Home to Report</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - According to sources at the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese Deputy Envoy here, Wakasugi, has been ordered by the Japanese Ambassador Nomura to depart for Tokyo today to report on matters here to the Japanese government in person.</p>

<h3>Ukraine War in Progress: Soviet Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive; German Forces Divide to Probe Odessa</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th: The focus of the six-week-old Soviet-German war has suddenly shifted to the southern sector, where a new major battle is underway in Ukraine. The fate of Kyiv and Odessa hinges on the outcome of this campaign. Recent German reports acknowledge that Soviet forces have launched a fierce counteroffensive, and state that powerful German air forces have joined the battle. According to Berlin reports received by Su Lieke,</p>
<p>German Forces Halted</p>
<p>before Kyiv are now attempting to divide their forces to probe the Black Sea port of Odessa. The German high command's attention is now focused on the southern front. According to a Berlin dispatch from the Basler Nachrichten, German military sources claim that the German-Romanian allied forces in the extreme south have been ordered to advance on Odessa, having forcibly crossed the Dniester River at several points near its estuary. Further north, German and Romanian troops who have crossed the river opposite Kishinev are advancing in a southeasterly direction to join forces. Neither of these accounts has been confirmed by Moscow. Recent German reports of an "annihilation battle" taking place 150 miles south of Kyiv are likely related to the assault on Odessa. The claim of new battles south of Kyiv indicates that the German direct southwest assault on Kyiv failed, and they are now applying new pressure on Kyiv from the south in an attempt to resolve the battle for Kyiv. A Berlin dispatch from the Basler Nachrichten, criticizing the intensity of the fighting, states that news of the Soviet counteroffensive and holding actions indicates that the Soviet forces' fighting capacity or</p>
<p>Will to Resist</p>
<p>has not diminished. The dispatch also states that the German official announcement placing East Galicia under German civil administration as part of the Polish German government has dashed the hopes of Ukrainian nationalists that this area would become part of an independent Ukraine. General Buteni, commander of the Soviet forces in the southern sector, stated yesterday that German forces have formed a broad arc-shaped line west and south of Kyiv, extending from Korosten in the far north, south to Zhytomyr, where fierce fighting has taken place for days, and then southeast to Bila Tserkva (45 miles southwest of Kyiv). It is rumored that the German forces are launching a pincer movement in Ukraine aimed at cutting off the vital railway lines connecting central Russia with the Ukrainian mining region and Odessa. Ukraine has now become the main front, and news of continued fighting on the far northern front has arrived today. Finnish sources acknowledge that Soviet forces in that area are</p>
<p>Repeatedly Counterattacking</p>
<p>and there is also fighting on the Estonian and Baltic fronts. The situation in the central sector around Smolensk remains largely unchanged, and Smolensk itself remains in Soviet hands. The battle record of the Soviet 99th Division, which has been fighting continuously since the German invasion, has only now been revealed. The division has been repeatedly surrounded, but has always fought its way out, moving hundreds of miles eastward, and launching fierce counterattacks whenever the opportunity arises. In the first four weeks of the fighting, the division annihilated six German regiments. German propaganda now insists that Soviet guerrillas behind German lines must be eliminated before a major victory can be achieved. However, a Reuters dispatch from Moscow states that this is to</p>
<p>Prepare the Germans</p>
<p>for a longer war than they had anticipated. The activity of Soviet guerrillas has undermined German confidence and greatly frustrated German troops accustomed to following plans. According to a Soviet naval announcement, Soviet forces have sunk at least eleven enemy submarines, nine destroyers, twelve transport ships, three oil tankers, and one munitions ship in the Baltic and Black Seas.</p>
<h3>Soviet Mechanized Troops Fight Valiantly to Defend Kyiv, Containing Large-Scale Attacks from Two Directions; Heavy Losses for Elite German Units</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 4th: It was announced here today that Soviet tank columns, infantry, and cavalry are fighting valiantly to defend Kyiv, preventing it from being encircled by German forces. Yesterday, they successfully repelled large-scale attacks from two directions against Kyiv. Elite German units suffered heavy losses in the face of fierce Soviet counterattacks, and many retreated. Large numbers of Soviet tanks and two regiments of mechanized Soviet infantry flanked and annihilated two German regiments in the Zhytomyr area. The battle lasted six hours, with over 1,500 German soldiers killed. The remaining 340 officers and soldiers surrendered to the Soviet side. The commander of the Southern Front is reportedly deploying infantry, cavalry, tanks, and mechanized forces to strengthen Kyiv's defenses. Residents of Kyiv can hear the sound of artillery fire 40 miles to the south.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report for the night of the 3rd, stating that during the day, fighting continued in the Smolensk, Korosten, and Bila Tserkva areas, as well as on the Estonian front. There were no changes in our troop positions in other sectors. Our air force and army jointly struck enemy motorized columns, mechanized columns, infantry units, and cavalry units. On the 2nd, our air force destroyed thirteen enemy aircraft, while we lost nineteen. Two hundred German aircraft raided Moscow at night, and two were shot down. We suffered no losses. A German submarine was sunk in the Baltic Sea. According to confirmed reports, our aircraft attacked the port of Constanta on the night of the 1st, hitting an enemy destroyer and other ships.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 4th: Soviet authorities state that the powerful German forces attempting to seize Kyiv have made some progress, but their losses since the 4th have been alarming. The areas where German forces are attacking most fiercely are reportedly the Smolensk, Korosten, and Bila Tserkva areas, followed by the Tallinn area. Korosten is 90 miles northwest of Kyiv, while Bila Tserkva is 50 miles southwest of Kyiv.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th: German motorized units crossed the N River using pontoon bridges and attacked our units in the D area, but were fiercely repelled. Our troops took a defensive position, forcing the enemy to retreat to the riverbank. At the same time, soldiers of the Red Army under Adjutant Snilorev operated behind enemy lines, blowing up the pontoon bridges and cutting off the enemy's retreat. Our defending troops fired directly at the enemy with machine guns, resulting in a complete rout. Over 4,000 German soldiers were killed or drowned, 40 military vehicles were destroyed, and 120 men were captured.</p>
<h3>Italian Expeditionary Force Joins the Attack on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th: The German official news agency reports that the Italian Expeditionary Force, which has now arrived on the southern front, will join the battlefield within days to attack Soviet forces. Elite Italian troops from northern Italy have arrived directly at the front line by train, fully equipped.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 4th: A Romanian General Staff communiqué states that the rear of a large Soviet force fighting between the Dniester and Bug Rivers is now threatened. German and Romanian forces continue to advance between these two rivers. Motorized units there have penetrated deep into the Soviet lines, threatening a large enemy force from the rear. Efforts to encircle the enemy are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Only a Few German Aircraft Invade Soviet Capital</h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 4th: German aircraft raided Moscow again on the night of the 2nd and morning of the 3rd. The alert was lifted after three hours. Officials stated that only a few bombers penetrated the city, with the rest being repelled by anti-aircraft fire and night fighters on the outskirts of Moscow. German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs from high altitude, causing several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. It was discovered that although Moscow was bombed by German aircraft, the damage was minimal.</p>
<h3>Hopkins Returns to England from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th: U.S. President's Special Envoy Hopkins has returned here last night after visiting the Soviet Union and meeting with Stalin and Soviet government and General Staff personnel.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 4th: Hopkins has left Moscow. Molotov, Director of the Drafting Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and Evstigneev, Director of the Foreign Relations Department of the People's Defense Committee, escorted him to the border.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Commander Arrives in Saigon</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: According to a Japanese newspaper report, Vice Admiral Kinoshita, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in Vietnamese waters, arrived in Saigon yesterday from Cam Ranh Bay. In a reception for journalists, he stated that the Japanese military's entry into Vietnam is now almost complete. With the conclusion of the Japan-France joint defense agreement for Vietnam, Japan is dispatching troops to Vietnam in accordance with the agreement without delay. This is truly something to celebrate for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He will abide by the spirit of joint defense, and he is deeply gratified that the Vietnamese government and people are sincerely cooperating with the Japanese military to facilitate their entry into Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy to Establish Defenses at Cam Ranh Bay</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th: A Saigon-based correspondent for the Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese Navy will establish defenses at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam as a base of operations to counter the encirclement by China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Japanese newspapers continue to pay close attention to rumors that China, Britain, and the United States are attempting to bring the Soviet Union into the encirclement.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on the European War (7) (2)</p>
<h3>The Bookkeeper of the Democratic Front</h3>
<p>The functions of the Ministry of Finance are generally unfamiliar to most people. Besides collecting customs duties and national revenue, issuing and redeeming government bonds, they also include the mint and banknote printing plant, as well as the Narcotics Suppression Bureau, which undertakes special operations, and peacetime coastal defense forces. In recent years, the powers of the Ministry of Finance have greatly expanded. It must manage the equalization fund relating to various countries, negotiate with Britain on the purchase of arms in the United States in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, and manage frozen foreign assets. The total amount of these assets, as of the end of June this year, is over $14 billion. The recently frozen Japanese assets and the assets that China has voluntarily requested to be frozen are substantial and have not yet been included in this calculation.</p>
<p>Guiding such large-scale undertakings is truly a monumental task. Therefore, personnel at the Ministry of Finance have no other option but to immerse themselves in their work and adapt to changing circumstances. From the outside, the cold, marble-covered corridors of the Ministry of Finance building and the old-fashioned gilded pilasters hardly suggest the intensity of the work going on inside. But behind the row of doors with white-paneled windows lining the corridor, financial experts are racking their brains day and night, drafting tax laws, promoting national defense savings, planning new bonds, and monitoring the development of the financial market and the inflow and outflow of funds. With substantial expenditures on national defense, aid to Britain, and aid to China, the funds raised must exceed the original amount in order to cope with any contingency.</p>
<p>Morgenthau is accustomed to waking up early. He gets up at 6:30 every morning and spends from 7:30 reading newspapers from New York and Washington and speaking by phone with one or two staff members. One of his favorite employees walks two miles from his home to the office every morning. By 8:45 every morning, Morgenthau is already at his desk, ready to handle the day's work. At 9:30 every morning, the Ministry of Finance holds a staff meeting, attended by the Undersecretary and various Directors, from ten to twelve people.</p>
<p>The meeting takes place in the Secretary's office in the southwest corner of the second floor. The room is filled with an air of elegance, serenity, and solemnity, more like a private library than an office. The other rooms in this century-old building are similar.</p>
<p>The staff members attending the meeting sit around the Secretary, who begins by reporting some important information that everyone should know. Then, he asks each person sitting around the circle to express their opinions. The meeting is of a discussion nature, sometimes very lively, but never contentious. This is the principle prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p>As for Morgenthau himself, he frankly admits that finance is his life's work. He does not allow other things to distract his interest. In addition to working during the day, he often brings a stack of newspapers home to read after dinner.</p>
<p>Except for one day a week when he has lunch with the President at the White House, he usually has lunch in a small room under his office, accessible by a private elevator. In this room is an oval table where the ill-fated debt agreements were discussed and signed after the last European war. (End)</p>

<h3>French Tram Workers Strike Again Yesterday; All Tramcars Halted; Dispute Arises from Unequal Treatment; Authorities Exert Efforts to Mediate for Early Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>Workers of the French Water and Electricity Company demanded an increase in allowances, and through their representatives negotiated with the political department of the French police. The company manager agreed to consider the request and respond before the 10th. Tram and other workers believed that the company was not sincere in accepting their demands, and at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, they spontaneously went on strike. All tramcars and buses were completely halted, some abandoned by the roadside. The company then managed to drive them into the Lokawei factory. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Disparities in Treatment Between Chinese and Foreign Employees</p>
<p>Since August 1st, when the French Water and Electricity Company uniformly increased the prices of electricity, water, trams, and buses, they also accepted the employees' request to generally increase allowances, announcing a 15% increase in employee allowances. However, Chinese employees were dissatisfied because Western employees in the company received a 50% salary increase across the board, treating them differently. They firmly demanded equal treatment, but the company has not given a satisfactory response, leading to a tendency for labor to strike again. Yesterday afternoon, the political department of the French police, together with worker representatives, negotiated with the company manager. The company agreed to consider the workers' demands and respond before August 10th. However, tram and other workers were dissatisfied and announced a strike at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Workers Strike, All Vehicles Halt</p>
<p>After the workers spontaneously went on strike, all trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating within the French Concession stopped or were driven into the Lokawei factory, or abandoned by the roadside. Upon learning of the workers' strike, the company immediately requested the French police to send Chinese and Western detectives to guard the Lokawei factory and the company's gate. Western employees then managed to tow the vehicles to the factory. As a result, tram routes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10, trolleybus routes 17, 18, and 24, and bus routes 21 and 22 were completely halted after 4:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Persuasion from All Sides for Immediate Resolution</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the political department of the French police and others have instructed worker representatives to persuade the workers to resume work as soon as possible to maintain traffic, and to wait for the company's response before August 10th. They also took responsibility for mediating the situation, as the company did not firmly reject the workers' request to increase allowances by the same 51% as foreign employees, and had agreed to consider and respond. As of last night, the workers had not yet agreed to resume work first, but it is anticipated that this strike will not escalate, and a solution may be hoped for in the short term, as the point of contention is not very serious.</p>
<p>English Trams Stop at the French Concession Border</p>
<p>The English Shanghai Tramway Company's tram route 5 and trolleybus routes 17, 18, and 24 have a mutual route plan between the International Settlement and the French Concession. Since the French Water and Electricity Company workers' strike, the above routes have stopped operating in the French Concession. Tram route 5 stops at Dongxinqiao, trolleybus routes 17 and 18 turn around at the Great World, and trolleybus route 24 stops at the intersection of Seymour Road and Avenue Foch. Since the tram and bus service in the French Concession was suspended, rickshaw drivers were making three times their usual business. Citizens felt greatly inconvenienced.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Search Nanshi, Confiscate Arms</h3>
<p>The situation in Nanshi, which has been blockaded by iron gates, has eased slightly as of yesterday. The Japanese have opened a small path in the barbed wire next to the Xin Kai He Fire Brigade, allowing women and children to leave, but strictly prohibiting passage on Min Guo Road. It is stipulated that those wishing to go to the concessions must detour from Guanyinge Street opposite the Xin Kai He Water Works, diagonally crossing Min Guo Road, and exit through the gap in the barbed wire. However, young adults cannot leave without special certification from the Japanese. As for the Japanese troops conducting strict searches in the refugee area of Nanshi for several days, a large number of people have been arrested as suspects. It is rumored that a machine gun was seized from a house near the City God Temple the day before yesterday, along with many hand grenades and firearms. Telephones installed in residents' homes have all been disconnected since yesterday. According to other news, the search is expected to be completed tomorrow, and the iron gates may be opened, but this cannot be confirmed. Furthermore, according to someone who came out of Nanshi yesterday, after four days of blockade, food is in short supply. Rice has risen to three yuan per liter, and there is nowhere to buy it. Each pancake costs four corners. Vegetables cannot be purchased due to the disruption of supplies. Pork is still available, but it costs six yuan per catty, causing residents of Nanshi to cry out in distress.</p>
<h3>Proper Merchants Apply for Foreign Exchange, Procedure Extremely Strict; Must Be Creditworthy and Detail Purpose; Foreign Exchange Checks Only Paid After Review; British Government Authorizes HSBC and Three Other Banks to Handle Applications</h3>
<p>Since the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds on the 25th of last month, the US Treasury Department has issued two types of notes: one authorizing Hawaii and the Philippines to maintain normal trade relations with China and Japan, and one authorizing fourteen foreign banks in Shanghai to provide foreign exchange to maintain normal trade between China and the United States, South America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. The procedures stipulated in General Notes 58 and 59 could be followed. Britain, on the other hand, simply ordered all branches in China or outside China to seal all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, regardless of nationality, to prevent them from being transferred. Although it was stated that import and export trade between China and the sterling bloc would still be maintained, no detailed procedures were specified. British banks then sent telegrams to London for instructions. According to reports from the Great China News Agency, the response has arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, three British banks, to handle applications and provide foreign exchange. The following are the details of the information obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Application Regulations Very Thorough</p>
<p>Regarding the procedures for applying for foreign exchange, the main points of the US regulations are: (1) must be bona fide import and export trade; (2) the applicant must be a Chinese or foreign person engaged in import and export trade in China before March 14th of this year; (3) the foreign exchange applied for should be equal to the value of the import and export trade. Currently, all foreign banks are handling applications for US dollars in accordance with the above principles. As for the procedures for applying for pounds sterling, the response arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The text of the telegram has not been made public. According to sources from senior HSBC bank officials, the British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, three British banks, to provide foreign exchange to merchants who have accounts with the above three banks and whose creditworthiness has been deemed reliable by the managers of the three banks. The application must specify in detail to which place and bank the funds are to be paid, what goods are to be purchased, and the amount required, and be submitted to the three banks for review. The foreign exchange check is then paid after approval by the managers of the three banks, allowing them to use the funds. The procedure is very careful and strict.</p>
<p>British Nationals Allowed to Withdraw Living Expenses</p>
<p>In addition, the British government's announced freeze order, ordering all branches in China or outside China to seal all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, regardless of nationality, has resulted in British nationals' funds being frozen as well, making it impossible for them to withdraw funds for even the most basic living expenses and other legitimate uses. At the request of British nationals, the banks have also telegraphed London for instructions on how to improve the situation. In yesterday's response, the British government has reportedly provided instructions on how to improve the situation. The reporter has not yet been able to confirm this, but it is known that HSBC, in view of the plight of those who rely on deposits for their livelihood, has made changes to the policy of not allowing any withdrawals after careful consideration. It has allowed British depositors to withdraw small amounts of three or five pounds for temporary living expenses. It is difficult to approve amounts exceeding these.</p>
<p>Exports from Shanghai Inevitably Reduced</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the freeze order, British and American banks have been unable to freely provide foreign exchange, which has inevitably had a significant impact on Shanghai's foreign trade. A senior official of a British bank told the reporter about a noticeable natural phenomenon, believing that Britain and the United States will inevitably reduce exports to Shanghai. It is said that at present, all foreign banks in Shanghai have refused to undertake exchange pledges. For example, if a merchant intends to export goods worth 10,000 yuan to a foreign country, in the past, they only needed to pay the bank one-third of the value of the goods in foreign exchange to be able to load the goods onto the ship for export. Later, the exchange pledge increased to one-half, but now it has increased to one hundred percent, that is, for goods worth 10,000 yuan, they must first pay 10,000 yuan in foreign exchange. The purpose of this move is clearly to prevent the goods from being interrupted en route, on the way, or other impacts due to changes in the situation.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Discovered in Japanese-Administered Hongkou</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer in Shanghai, the weather has been abnormal. Although the recent heatwave has returned to normal, the late July rains were continuous and cool, resembling autumn. Because the climate has been suddenly cold and hot, and suddenly sunny and rainy, epidemics are rampant. It is reported that smallpox was discovered in Yangshupu the day before yesterday. The patient, Kim Jeong-gil, a 30-year-old Korean, lived at 226 MacTaggart Road, Yuanfang Road, Yangshupu. After diagnosis by a doctor, it was determined that he had smallpox, and he was sent to the Tungren Society Baziqiao Hospital for treatment. The Japanese military then sealed off the surrounding area, cut off traffic, carried out large-scale disinfection, and temporarily vaccinated approximately 200 Chinese and Japanese residents in the area for prevention.</p>
<h3>Overseas British Nationals in China Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>British nationals in China recently raised a large sum of money and presented it to the government to purchase a squadron of aircraft to be incorporated into the British Air Force, named the "China British Squadron". The British nationals have set a goal to raise £200,000 sterling by August 15th to continue purchasing a second "China British Squadron" to strengthen the British Air Force's power.</p>
<h3>French Concession Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Meets to Review Rice Market; Resolves to Maintain Original Prices of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The French Concession Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is deeply concerned about the overall food situation in Shanghai. In view of the current rise in rice prices, which is purely due to malicious rumors and manipulation by speculative rice merchants, the Committee could not bear to stand idly by. On the 28th of last month, it invited responsible representatives from the rice, coal, beef and mutton, Chinese and foreign groceries, soy sauce, and fresh meat industries to discuss stabilizing the food supply and suppressing the prices of various goods. After discussion, the Committee determined the standard sales prices of four types of foreign rice on the spot and ordered all rice shops in the city to comply. In order to review whether the rice prices that have been evaluated are suitable for the standard, the Committee convened responsible representatives from the above industries again at 3:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss continuing to suppress rice prices. More than ten representatives from the rice, coal, and Chinese and foreign groceries industries attended. Zhu Yigui, Chinese Secretary of the French Municipal Council, also attended. The meeting was still chaired by Vina. As a result of the discussion, the evaluated four types of foreign rice will remain at the original prices, namely: (1) No. 1 Saigon (160 city catties per stone) 116 yuan, (2) No. 2 Saigon 119 yuan, (3) Fair Price Small Broken Rice 116 yuan, (4) No. 1 and 2 Saigon Mixed Broken Rice 89 yuan.</p>
<h3>England and America Should Adopt Stern Measures to Keep Thailand Neutral and Provide Protection and Economic Assistance to Save Thailand; the Opportunity is Fleeting</h3>
<p>An editorial by Mr. Woodhead was published in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" yesterday, extensively discussing the threat to Thailand from Japan. It stated that to save Thailand from suffering the same fate as French Indochina, all democratic nations must immediately take stern measures that are coordinated with each other to be effective. It is rumored that Japan is currently making excessive demands on Thailand, effectively monopolizing its trade and paving the way for using Thai territory as a military base for land and air forces.</p>
<p>Emergency Control of Huge Loans</p>
<p>It is reported that Japan's first action in this direction was to obtain a line of credit from a Thai banking group for 10 million Thai baht, equivalent to 16 million Japanese yen. For a small country to lend such a large amount to another country is remarkable. If democratic nations implement the recently announced economic retaliation to the greatest extent possible, the lending country risks economic ruin. Japan's move must be seen as the first step in economically and politically controlling Thailand.</p>
<p>Continuing Land Cessions to Thailand</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams, Japan's subsequent actions will involve ceding Vietnamese territory to Thailand, including the famous Angkor temple site, to induce the Thai government to sign an agreement allowing Japan to establish land and air bases in Thailand. This obviously contradicts the guarantees made by the Japanese government when signing the Thai-Vietnamese border agreement and the promises made to Vichy (and the British ambassador) last week. Japan guaranteed on March 11, when the Thai-Vietnamese border agreement was signed, that the terms of the agreement were "inviolable" and assured Vichy that Japan would strictly fulfill its obligation to respect Vietnam's territorial and sovereign integrity. However, Angkor was not part of the territory ceded during the negotiations in March.</p>
<p>Must Give the Dutch East Indies Real Guarantees</p>
<p>There are several ways that democratic nations can prevent Japan from invading Thailand. First, they must increase direct pressure on Japan, declaring that unless Japan abandons any intention of political or economic aggression against Thailand, economic retaliation will be inflexible. In this regard, to facilitate sincere cooperation from the Dutch East Indies, Britain and America must give the Dutch East Indies a real guarantee that they will not doubt that if Japan threatens or even attacks the Dutch East Indies due to a complete embargo against Japan or Japanese-controlled areas, Britain and America will take countermeasures. Britain and America should not make the Dutch East Indies the vanguard of retaliation against Japan without guaranteeing their protection.</p>
<p>Britain and America Have Always Been Very Friendly to Thailand</p>
<p>Furthermore, Britain and America must formulate a clear policy towards Thailand itself. The British government's relationship with Thailand has always been quite friendly, based on mutual trust. No well-informed Thai person suspects that Britain and America harbor any aggressive intentions towards Thailand. The British military preparations near the Thai border were notified to the Thai government with explanations. A Thai military delegation from Bangkok was recently welcomed by the British and visited defense areas. Newspapers in Bangkok recently compared the measures taken by the British in Malaya and Burma with the actions of the Japanese in Vietnam, praising the British.</p>
<p>Britain Permits Oil Exports to Thailand</p>
<p>Two months ago, Britain permitted the import of petroleum products from British territories to Thailand on a pro-rata basis. This demonstrates Britain's concern for Thailand's welfare. Thailand cannot obtain oil supplies without British-Dutch cooperation. Britain and America should immediately declare that if the Thai government makes concessions that harm British and American interests, no oil will be available. Japan is in no position to supply oil to Thailand. In fact, a British-American-Dutch oil embargo, if truly effective, would require the Japanese land, sea, and air forces in Vietnam to transport gasoline and petroleum products from Japan, depleting Japan's reserves.</p>
<p>Hoping for Strict Neutrality</p>
<p>It must also be clarified that if Thailand becomes a base for further Japanese aggression, the freeze on Japanese funds imposed by Britain, America, and the Netherlands will be applied to Thailand with the same severity. However, the actions of Britain and America should not rely solely on threats. They should also guarantee that if Thailand adheres to a strict policy of neutrality, it will receive economic and financial assistance and protection. Britain and America do not want Thailand to have disputes with Japan; what they hope for from Thailand is neutrality, not active cooperation. If Thailand refuses to make concessions to avoid being used to attack British, Dutch, or American territories in the Far East, Britain and America should guarantee its territorial integrity and economic autonomy without hesitation. The opportunity to save Thailand from becoming a victim of the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" must not be lost.</p>
<h3>Staff of Southern Goods Store Attempts to Harm Mother-in-Law but Fails; Encounters a Female Server, Marries Last Autumn and Cohabitates; the Woman's Mother Repeatedly Makes Demands, Leading to Enmity</h3>
<p>Wang Linbao, from Ningbo, is 19 years old. He lost his parents at a young age and recently worked as a clerk at the Sanyang Southern Goods Store at 630 Nanjing Road. Last November, he went to the rooftop garden of Wing On Company, where he met Wu Ailian (also known as A Yuan), a 17-year-old female server in the cinema department from Nanjing. He fell in love at first sight. Learning that she was unmarried, Wang went to her home at 19 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession to court her. They fell in love, and he discussed marriage with her mother, Wu Qiang.</p>
<p>Talking About the Bride Price</p>
<p>of 3,600 yuan, as she had no son, it was as good as recruiting Wang as a son-in-law. Wang Linbao's parents were deceased, but he had an aunt, Ms. Song, who lived on North Shansi Road and owned the Dafeng Southern Goods Store, possessing considerable wealth. Wang told her about his intention to marry A Yuan and sought her support. However, Aunt Song had arranged a marriage for him with a woman from their hometown, but Wang had divorced her because he found her unsophisticated. Therefore, she ignored his request. Wang Linbao, infatuated with A Yuan, made vows of eternal love with her.</p>
<p>Engaged to Be Lifelong Partners</p>
<p>He gradually handed over the bride price of 3,600 yuan to her mother, Wu Zhang, who accepted it. In March of this year, he and the woman inspected a house at 185 Mike Tor Road and moved from the French Concession to live there as husband and wife. They planned to get married before the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, Wu Zhang demanded an additional 1,100 yuan for the wedding ceremony, which Wang Linbao refused, leading to a dispute. Wang suddenly had a malicious thought to kill her. He recently purchased</p>
<p>Poisonous Mercury</p>
<p>in a package from the Zhu Bonian Medicinal Materials Store on Fujian Road and hid it inside a cardboard box of Rendan pills, waiting for an opportunity to act. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, at 8:30 AM, Wang bought a large bowl of oily tofu vermicelli from a street vendor and brought it back. He divided it into three glasses and secretly added the mercury to one of them, giving it to A Yuan to feed to her mother, Wu Zhang, to harm her life. She felt severe abdominal pain after drinking it and hired a vehicle to Renji Hospital for treatment. She learned that the oily tofu vermicelli contained poison, which Wang Linbao had added due to past grudges. Fortunately, the toxicity was mild. After some time, the pain subsided, and she returned home clear-headed. She reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent detective Chen Boqin to the Sanyang Southern Goods Store</p>
<p>to Arrest Wang</p>
<p>He was taken to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution for attempted murder, requesting an investigation. Wu Zhang testified about the incident, and detective Chen presented the Rendan box, glass, and the remaining poisonous mercury. Questioned, the defendant confessed that he had put mercury in two glasses, one for Wu Zhang and one for himself, intending to commit suicide together. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ordered him to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Former Chinese General Manager of Swire, Yang Meinan, Passes Away</h3>

The funeral is scheduled for 10:00 AM today at the International Funeral Parlor. Mr. Yang was a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, and was 71 years old. He worked for Swire for more than 40 years and retired last June, just one year and two months ago. Yang was kind and amiable, and all his colleagues, both Chinese and foreign, respected him.

The company flew its flag at half-mast yesterday in mourning for Mr. Yang.</p>
<h3>Approaching the Fourth Anniversary of the Shanghai War; All Sectors Prepare for Commemoration; Step up Donation Drives for Disaster Relief; Concessions Decide to Implement Joint Alert</h3>
<p>The fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War is approaching. Given the special environment of Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city have decided not to hold extravagant commemorative ceremonies for this great and sacred anniversary. However, to express their firm belief in resistance and to mourn the martyrs and compatriots who died in the war, various groups have jointly decided to suspend all entertainment activities and observe a vegetarian diet for one day. At noon on that day, everyone will stand up in their respective places and silently mourn. At the same time, they will step up the donation drive for disaster relief, using resolute action as a solemn commemoration.</p>
<p>Joint Alert by Concession Authorities</p>
<p>In view of the approaching anniversary of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council have decided to implement a joint alert to maintain security within the concessions and prevent any disturbances. The various measures and methods have been jointly agreed upon by the two authorities. In addition to deploying the defense forces and merchant corps to assist in the alert, they have also decided that from the 9th onwards, no organization within the concessions may hold meetings, form associations, march, or demonstrate. Police officers will be stationed in all public places to closely monitor and strictly enforce curfew laws. Traffic on roads, lanes, and bridges will be subject to security measures as needed.</p>
<h3>Photography Industry Employees Suddenly Go on Strike Yesterday; Workers Try to Persuade Others to Join, Leading to Conflicts; One Employee Injured; One Person Arrested</h3>
<p>There are a total of 150 to 160 photography studios of various sizes and artistic levels in Shanghai, employing more than 1,200 workers. Wages range from 30 to 50 yuan to over 200 yuan per month, also varying widely. Recently, all employees organized a trade union and</p>
<p>Made Demands</p>
<p>to the studios, requesting a wage increase of 20% to 90%, a monthly rice subsidy of three dou per person, 20% of the annual profit as a bonus, and the implementation of an eight-hour workday, among 15 other conditions. The photography studios had previously had no contact with each other. Therefore, all the studio owners organized the Shanghai Photographic Trade Association. After its establishment, they elected representatives to negotiate with the labor representatives. The two sides met twice, and the results were satisfactory. They scheduled</p>
<p>Another Discussion</p>
<p>for the 7th. However, the employees believed that the employers lacked sincerity and suddenly went on strike yesterday morning. Some employees had not yet joined the union. Striking workers went to persuade them to stop working and join the strike. When the striking workers went to the Baille Photography Studio at 614 Avenue Joffre, the employees of the studio did not understand their intentions and refused to stop working, leading to a conflict. As a result, some of the studio's equipment was slightly damaged, and one employee was injured in the head. The incident was reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched a large number of detectives</p>
<p>to Suppress the Scene</p>
<p>One hat-wearing worker was arrested on the spot. At the same time, the Guangyi Photography Studio at 538 Jing'an Temple Road was also vandalized by striking workers, who destroyed camera boxes and other equipment, causing significant losses. The political departments of the International Settlement and the French Concession have sent personnel to investigate separately to convene both parties for mediation.</p>

<h3>Finance; Importers Settle US Dollar Advances</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed rates for various currencies did not change. The black market rate for British currency was slightly soft. Gold prices returned to level after being soft. After the morning opening, British and American commercial banks were willing to supply. French-owned Banque de l'Indochine also released some funds. However, importers only managed to settle half of their 50,000-yuan demand at a rate of 5.25 yuan per US dollar. Due to continued difficulties in securing Russian currency, the market tended to level off. However, the rate for British gold hardened to 31/25, at which it could be settled. In the afternoon, speculators engaged in new transactions for the September term. British and American commercial banks supplied, and the market saw little change. The closing prices were higher than the previous Saturday for British currency and level for US dollars. Trading activity was not brisk.</p>
<p>British and French Commercial Banks Provided Supply</p>
<p>Since morning, the London and New York metal markets showed no activity, and the price of Indian silver remained unchanged. International exchange rates saw British currency against Shanghai rise by 0.03125, while other rates remained level. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. At the opening of the domestic market, banks offered spot British currency at 31/32.09375, Indian currency rose by 0.015625, and US dollars remained level at 5.2875 yuan. Upon hearing this, British and French commercial banks supplied, and the market immediately hardened. HSBC's listed rates remained level. The silver equalization tax remained slightly at 24.25%. At HSBC's small counter, the US dollar rate remained at 5.1875 yuan. Later, importers came to secure US dollars for the August term at 5.25 yuan. Benefiting and some American banks supplied 25,000 yuan, which Banque de l'Indochine sold at the same price. Since foreign banks absorbed the supply, it softened again and became difficult to settle. However, after Chinese banks conducted mutual transactions for August British gold at 21/25, it stabilized. The afternoon closing prices were 31/32.125 for British currency and 5.12875 yuan for US dollars.</p>
<p>New Prices for September British Gold Also Appear</p>

New prices for the September term were also released (according to Reuters), with British gold at 31/32.109375 and US dollars at 5.2875 yuan, the same as the spot price.</p>
<p>Quiet Trading in Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange</p>
<p>The Hong Kong exchange market was closed yesterday, and no telegrams were received. The Tianjin exchange market has also been inactive for several days. It was heard yesterday that exchanging 100 yuan of 法幣in Shanghai to Tianjin could fetch 50 yuan of "聯鈔," but this was only on the black market. Since trading was very quiet, some have stopped these transactions.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Spot Prices Reach Unprecedented Highs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold prices on the black market continued to decline, with prices falling below the 6,700-yuan mark. Everyone was exhausted and speculated that US-Japanese relations were about to break down. The US dollar was at 5.25 yuan, and British and American commercial banks were willing to sell. HSBC and securities firms rushed to sell, and the price fell from an opening of 6,705 yuan to a low of 6,670 yuan. Unexpectedly, purchases by importers to settle 50,000 US dollars brought the price back to around 6,690 yuan. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were even narrower, only 9 yuan high or low. The final result was a small 16-yuan gain. After the market closed, there were rumors of a US-Japanese compromise, and the price immediately rose to 6,704 yuan. Total trading volume exceeded 20,000 taels. Cash prices rose again and reached unprecedented highs. In the morning, Yida and Wanfeng each acquired 10 taels of 懂記金, priced at 8,250 yuan.

Jewelry gold also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 855 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Prices Fall Below 7,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price for each tael (10 taels) was 6,705 yuan at 9:15 AM, 2 yuan lower than the noon closing price on the previous Saturday. It was rumored that foreign exchange rates were softening, and US dollars could be settled at 5.25 yuan. Xinfengyong, Dingsheng, Yida, and Xinyuan rushed to sell, and retail investors also sold. The market price fell, dropping below 6,700 yuan. The decline accelerated, dropping by 35 yuan. At 9:45 AM, it fell to 6,670 yuan, which was aggressively bought by 天元 and 熾大, who covered their short positions and raised the price to around 6,680 yuan. Xinfengyong came back to buy, pushing the price up to 6,692 yuan. The market was flat at noon, with little fluctuation, and had fallen to a low of 6,685 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,688 yuan.

<h3>Grain: Java Rice Arrives Again, Rice Prices Drop Further</h3>
<p>Another shipment of Java foreign rice has arrived. The Zhibaide postal ship of Java Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 2nd) at noon, carrying about 11,000 bags, totaling 1,100 tons, of foreign rice loaded from Java, as well as over 500 bags of corn. It docked at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of foreign rice led to sluggish sales and a weak market sentiment. This was because inventories were steadily increasing, the source of supply was continuous, transshipment had no outlet, the local market had a supply of affordable Hong Kong rice, and exchange rate contraction further dampened market confidence. In the late trading session, both current and forward rice prices declined across the board. Despite it being a week when local merchants usually replenish their stocks, purchases remained sluggish. Consequently, opening prices already showed a downward trend. The Yinghua Company saw no improvement, with Xiaojiao Road goods at only 148.2 yuan, and second-grade Siamese rice at only 144 yuan. Broken rice was at 104.5 yuan, all down by two or three yuan from the previous Saturday. There were also no large-scale transactions. The total market paper showed over 500 tons, and current rice prices were dragged down by one or two yuan. Transactions amounted to over 10,000 bags. At closing, first-grade Qu Gong rose from 133.5 yuan to 133 yuan, and then fell to 128 yuan; second-grade was at 122.5 yuan, then 123 yuan; first-grade Siamese rice was at 127 yuan, and second-grade at 120.5 yuan, then falling to 118 yuan; Min Dang rose from 131 yuan and fell to 125 yuan; Jia Fo rice was at 128.5 yuan, then 128 yuan; Xiaojiao Bank Warehouse was from 122.5 yuan to 121 yuan; outside warehouses were from 121 yuan to 120 yuan, then falling to 119 yuan; Tokyo Superior Special was at 117.5 yuan, then 116 yuan; rice tea was at 11 yuan, and broken special rice was from 95.5 yuan, falling to 89 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, thick and thin japonica rice rebounded with increased arrivals, leading to a return to weak market sentiment. This was because it was during the summer season, making goods susceptible to spoilage and unable to withstand prolonged storage, which loosened the sellers' intentions. Nowadays, general merchants are also wary of overstocking for the same reason, and sales are sluggish. As a result, in a market with more outgoing than incoming goods, thick and thin japonica rice traders found it difficult to maintain prices. Due to the soft texture and increased supply of early and late rice from Nangang, prices were lowered by more than two yuan, opening at 153 yuan to 151 yuan. Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice only dropped by one yuan, opening at 146 yuan to 142 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, with its seasonal decline, had a continuously weakening outlet. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high at 125.5 yuan, then fell to 122 yuan; glutinous mung beans were at 115 yuan to 112.5 yuan; and Guo Yuan was at 127 yuan, showing a softening of nearly one yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Rebounds</h3>
<p>Flour prices tended to soften because customer demand was not strong. Yesterday, there were more transactions of the Jinlong flour, initially opening at 32.15 yuan, then falling to 32.05 yuan, and further to 31.95 yuan, 31.85 yuan, 31.75 yuan, and 31.65 yuan. Paotai flour was at 33.05 yuan. Lianlou and Huawu flour, such as those stored in bank warehouses, were priced around 34.23 yuan, while Taigu and Roosevelt warehouse goods were below 34 yuan. None of these transactions were completed, indicating a possible continuation of market softening.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Red Beans Reach Peak – Breakthrough at 90 Yuan –</h3>
<p>The arrival of yellow beans has been scarce recently, and the declared reserves have gradually decreased. Coupled with the repeated surge in oil prices, market sentiment is unanimously optimistic. Yesterday, Shantou and Xiamen traders, as well as local stockpilers, purchased 600 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan, nearly 1,000 bags of Guide yellow beans, 500 bags of Qingkou yellow beans, and 300 bags of Jiaozhou yellow beans. Prices uniformly rose by two yuan. (See the market price section for detailed market conditions.)</p>
<p>Red bean arrivals were scarce and inventories were depleted, coinciding with the peak sales season. Consequently, market prices steadily increased. Yesterday, Guangdong traders purchased 50 bags of Tianjin red beans at a record high of 90 yuan, a significant jump of ten yuan compared to the previous level.</p>
<p>On the 5th, 495 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and 2,240 bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Hold Firm</h3>
<p>Two batches of new orchid bamboo branch goods arrived, totaling dozens of boxes. Due to the limited overall quantity, the market held steady, maintaining the original price of 340 yuan. Sixty or so boxes of old goods arrived, and the traders offered 30-40 yuan more. They have already telegraphed the owners to inquire, but no agreement has been reached yet.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Shenxin Factory Issues Price List, Double Horse Attempts to Advance but is Thwarted, Futures Yarn Sees Stronger Gains in Distant Months</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but market sentiment varies. Many believe that the goods purchased by Hong Kong traders have already been shipped out without issues. On the one hand, Hong Kong traders continue to actively trade in current yarn. It is reported that 2,600 bales of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, American cotton rebounded after a fall, leading to optimistic market sentiment. On the other hand, although sellers are trading in current yarn, the inland transportation lines are extremely difficult, which is predicted to prevent large-scale transactions from developing. Furthermore, factories show interest in selling, thus leaning towards selling off rather than continuous shortages, demonstrating the fierce contention between bulls and bears. In this regard, a tug-of-war between 550 yuan and 600 yuan is possible. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,577 yuan, and the low price was 1,554 yuan. In the early afternoon, it started at 1,560 yuan, then rose to 1,569 yuan, with the final price at 1,566-67 yuan. Shenxin Factory issued a factory price list for 20-count Double Horse at a current advance price of 1,540 yuan, totaling 1,500 bales.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with good sentiment due to the surge in American cotton. The initial tight price was 1,570 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,576 yuan. Subsequently, reports indicated that transactions with Guangdong traders were not very robust. At the same time, the Shenxin factory announced a large-scale offering, causing market sentiment to soften and short sellers to become active, pushing prices down to 1,554 yuan. However, the exchange market remained firm, and some traders returned to buy in several bales, causing the market to rebound to 1,563 yuan at closing. The statistical volume of transactions for the afternoon was 7,365 bales. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed as follows: Fellow Traders 7,000, Hong Kong 365, Total 7,365.</p>
<p>The Jin Xie Ma futures yarn market situation: The initial opening in the morning saw heightened volatility due to American cotton fluctuations. Gold firms and securities firms bought in near-term positions, with August rising by 5 yuan and September rising by 1 yuan. October, however, saw a sudden drop of 5 yuan as bulls were still emerging. Subsequently, due to the lack of any specific changes in foreign exchange and gold prices, and a lack of development in Hong Kong sales, many near-term bulls concluded their positions, with some shifting to distant positions. Market prices were soft in the near term but rebounded in the distant term. The afternoon closing saw August rise by 1 yuan, September rise by 1.5 yuan, and October rise by 0.5 yuan, with a total of 5,350 bales traded. The initial market opening indicated weakness in the near term but strength in the distant term. Later, due to rumors of a certain party taking over the court, new buyers and short covering drove prices up, with August reaching a high of 1,455 yuan, September reaching 1,530 yuan, and October reaching 1,519 yuan, before slightly retreating. The evening closing results showed August up by 8 yuan compared to last Saturday, September up by 19 yuan, and October up by 23 yuan. A total of 12,130 bales were traded today, an increase of 7,580 bales compared to the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded as follows (these are net closing prices):</p>
<p>Market Announcement: Market conditions have gradually stabilized in recent days. The special security deposit of 50 yuan per bale for new buying and selling transactions, which was separately levied from July 31st, has been cancelled from the 4th of this month.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Led by American Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has turned upward due to the unabated rise in American cotton prices, which has led to a firm market sentiment. However, demand from current cotton manufacturers has not shown significant development. Nevertheless, sentiment among recyclers has turned firm again. Rangoon Cotton 272 bales, Sulun 22 bales were sent to factories, and also 268 bales from No. 101 were delivered to the warehouse, and also High Grade 267 No. 5 and also 200 bales, and also 278 and also 100 bales, and also Brazilian Cotton 49 and also 129 bales, and also High Grade 505 and also 116 bales, and also Subgrade 490 and also 30 bales, and also Pengjiapo 381.5 and also 100 bales, and also Huishideng 381.5 and also 100 bales, and also Xingheng Cotton 280 and also 100 bales, and also.</p>
<h3>Oil and Wax: 800 Tons of Foreign Wax Arrive</h3>

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rebound – Xiangtai Lumber Stock Soars –</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, even more sharply than before. Roughly one or two firms covered their short positions, while two or three others saw an opportunity and bought in, pushing up market prices. Class C bonds were surprisingly bid up to seven yuan, due to short covering. There was no substantial reason for the continued rise, and the hidden uncertainties still remain. Yesterday morning, Shengda Public, Chengdechang bought in, while Jiufeng, Runde, Lianhe, and Lianyi sold off. The afternoon closing price improved by four to five jiao. In the afternoon, Xiexing and Yuantong bought in, while Hongda and Yichang took the opportunity to absorb them. Lianyi covered its positions, while Jiufeng, Runde, and Lianhe continued to cut losses. Shengda resold, and Yitai took the opportunity to dispose of its holdings. Class C bonds were bid up to seven yuan, with demand exceeding supply. As a result, prices uniformly continued to rise by five jiao to as much as nine and a half jiao. The transaction volume was around 2.5 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 14 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market opened modestly, and prices remained stable throughout the day. Xiangtai Lumber stock experienced another surge, soaring from 83.5 yuan to close at 91.5 yuan. The transaction volume was substantial. Gangye shares also rose from 32 yuan to 34.5 yuan. Rubber shares were quiet but also showed an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Java Sugar Arrives</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw a downward trend yesterday because the source of supply can be continuously loaded. 1,500 tons of Java sugar arrived yesterday, which caused a weak market sentiment and a relatively sharp decline in prices. In company futures trading, the initial price for August 10th was 103.2 jiao, which later fell to 100.75 jiao, a decrease of 2.5 jiao. The August 20th price was 103 yuan, 2.5 jiao, a decrease of 2.2 jiao.

<h3>Piece Goods: Sales of Hong Kong Cloth Flourish, Market Sentiment is Enthusiastic, Eastern Cloth also Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm, and market sentiment was enthusiastic. This was because demand from Guangdong was increasing, and local merchants' interest in trading was also strong. Cloth prices rose across the board. White cotton cloth and twill rose by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 1 yuan. Over 600 pieces of various cloths were traded in the lumber district. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders purchased over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, twill, and coarse cloth. Tianjin traders from the north purchased over 100 pieces of flannel, coarse cloth, and broadcloth. Overseas Nanyang traders purchased 5-6,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. On the 3rd, 910 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, and on the 5th, another 1,950 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 685 pieces were shipped to Calcutta.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: Yesterday, due to active spot sales, market prices continued to rise. Futures for various months of fine cloth on the exchange rose sharply, by 1.1 to 1.44 yuan per piece. The closing price for spot Lung Tou fine cloth was 52.6 yuan, up 0.8 yuan. Colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" serge, new batch with new taxes, was scarce, with the closing selling price opening at 1.725 yuan, a sharp increase of about 0.05 yuan per yard. New batch with old taxes was at 1.7015 yuan, and old batch with old taxes was at 1.665 yuan, also up about 0.03 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Linings and Interlinings Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Items such as linings and interlinings, like mercerized feather yarn, horsehair sleeve linings, printed foreign cloth, French interlining, black and gray interlining, and soft interlining, have recently risen again. This is due to the scarcity and high cost of raw materials, high factory overheads, increased costs, and fewer weavers than before. Buyers are eagerly inquiring about them. Yesterday, Datong wax thread mercerized feather yarn was wholesaled at 2.8 yuan per yard, Chen Heqing wax yarn was at 2.23 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were priced at one yuan. Ordinary silk-woven horsehair sleeve linings were sold at 3.8-3.9 yuan, and yarn-woven ones were at 3.25 yuan.

<h3>Coal: Tongdeli Coal is Being Hoarded – Market Conditions are Chaotic –</h3>
<p>The market conditions for Tongdeli white coal have been extremely chaotic recently. This is entirely due to traders hoarding their supplies, leading to a shortage of spot goods and creating a red-hot situation. Although Bingxing is still quoting the old price of 438 yuan, it is a market with prices but no goods, making it futile. A certain company opened at 455 yuan, plus 17 yuan for old orders. Therefore, prices in local shops also vary greatly. Screened lumps delivered to customers require 472 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Sells Rapidly</h3>
<p>Honeysuckle has been scarce recently, with depleted inventories. The cost of bringing goods here is very high, leading to a sudden tightening of the market. Yesterday, dozens of packages opened at 580 yuan for high-quality goods, with slightly lower prices for lesser quality, a significant increase of about 100 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>A Small Talk</p>
<h3>The Value of Life</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>Because literary and artistic works, dramas, and movies can be divided into morbid and healthy, anesthetizing and sobering, poisonous and non-toxic, we should, in the future, evaluate literary and artistic works, dramas, or movies, not only by their artistic value but also by their life value. No, we should, under the principle of not neglecting artistic value, place life value above artistic value. We put life value first because we have life before we have art.</p>
<p>In this way, we have a standard to follow for the selection of reading materials.</p>
<p>Reading materials that immerse young people in a dreamy, nihilistic, idealistic, or passive state are undoubtedly poisonous. What they instill in young people is a kind of escapist, degenerate, status quo-maintaining, distorted, and low-taste thinking, causing them to lose the courage to live and dare not face reality.</p>
<p>Beneficial progressive reading materials, although not all about praising the bright side, also include a lot of descriptions and exposures of ugliness, but in the words, beyond the words, an intense hatred is expressed imperceptibly, so that the requesters can understand its intention, and their minds suddenly open up. In the real world, they can fight more actively and follow the right path according to the hints in the book.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of spiritual poison or tonic can only be distinguished and chosen by the method of experience. It is not right to put the responsibility of distinguishing toxic or hygienic reading materials on young people. This responsibility should be shouldered by literary writers and book critics to make double efforts.</p>
<p>Invention</p>
<h3>Substitutes in the Voice of National Defense</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>In order to enable the national defense industry to obtain sufficient materials, the United States is now also working hard to conserve various metals, rubber, silk, cork, and certain types of wood. However, general consumers do not need to panic, because the government and private institutions are simultaneously doing their best to invent substitutes.</p>
<p>A so-called "plastics" industry has now developed almost very successfully. Metal parts that used to have to be made entirely or partially of lead, magnesium, tin, chromium, and zinc have now been almost completely replaced by this "clay." Whether it is fan blades, cameras, powder boxes, or aircraft parts, they can all be made of "clay." According to the statements of various factories that manufacture refrigerators and automobiles, "clay" is also surprisingly useful to them. Researchers at Ford Motor Company are still making greater efforts, hoping that "clay" can make more contributions to national defense. Many people believe that in the near future, aircraft wings can also be made of "clay" to save a large amount of aluminum and stainless steel for use in other needed areas.</p>
<p>Artificial resin enamel has been widely used as the main raw material for manufacturing tin cans. According to estimates by the American Institute of Sciences, at least 12,000 tons of new tin can be extracted from old tin cans every year. Therefore, all homemakers are now being told to avoid discarding old cans as much as possible.</p>
<p>There is a Production Management Bureau organized by metallurgical experts in Washington, D.C., whose greatest purpose is to study how to manufacture substitutes for various metals needed for national defense. They focus on the saving of aluminum and magnesium; others include tin, tungsten, and lead sheets.</p>
<p>Artificial rubber and copper have also attracted a lot of attention. The production of rubber in the United States was originally very small, but the need was particularly high. According to the results of on-site testing, artificial rubber is no worse than natural products. Now the biggest problem is that it cannot be produced in large quantities.</p>
<p>"Nylon," this long-familiar artificial silk, is an excellent substitute for real silk. Currently, many people are working hard to study how to use it to manufacture parachutes.</p>
<p>Recently, Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States has also claimed that they have discovered a new so-called "magnetic steel," which can be used to replace the need for steel and copper. Steel and copper were originally raw materials for manufacturing bullets, so this is like making a very big contribution to national defense.</p>
<p>During the last European war, we obtained many substitutes; then in this great war, undoubtedly, we will also see a large number of novel things. Readers just wait and see, my words are definitely not nonsense.</p>
<p>Profession</p>
<h3>I am a Professional Blood Transfuser</h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>Under the threat of the ever-increasing cost of living, I was finally forced to sell my own blood, and I am even a professional blood transfuser! After a year of blood transfusions, although I was able to fill my stomach, when I looked in the mirror, ah! I really couldn't help but scream in horror. The strong physique, full face, and bright eyes of the past, now the shadow shown in the mirror, are completely different people before and after. The strong has become weak, the full has become thin, and what about the usually bright eyes? At the same time, it is covered with a layer of gray and withered color, which is almost a living corpse. But, in order to live, I still have to struggle with a little remaining breath, take on the responsibility of my position, and save the general sick family who are more anemic and more dangerous than me, until I have transfused the last drop of blood from my own body.</p>
<p>However, my blood transfusion is different from others, that is, I don't have to go through the procedure of a doctor checking the blood type in advance, I only need to sell the blood I usually draw to general doctors for them to inject into patients at any time.</p>
<p>My blood is blue ink, and the fountain pen is of course equivalent to the envelope for drawing blood. When I put a sharp pen tip into the blue ink bottle, it is just like a needle piercing into a blood vessel. Although I temporarily feel a burst of heartache, when I think that my blood can save an anemic compatriot, my heart finally calms down.</p>
<p>However, the reward for blood transfusion is quite low, but it will often be devastated by general snobbish doctors - editors of publications and newspapers. Under their rash abandonment, one, two, ... all made unnecessary sacrifices. But I am only a small blood transfuser after all, what can I do about this kind of means? In addition to secretly regretting my ruined blood, I still have to put on a bitter smile in front of people, express false ease, and cover up the inner pain!</p>
<p>Sometimes after a long period of blood extraction, I feel even more wilted and unable to pile up for this already weak body, and I often fall on the bed, just like I have fainted, but I will not sleep so peacefully, but the rooster crows become my hypnotic clock, only the moment of dawn is the precious time for me to recover from fatigue.</p>
<p>I live every day in this extremely contradictory situation of "wanting to cry and forcing a smile." However, if you investigate carefully in this city, there must be many colleagues like me who are also living a painful life under the snobbish doctor's methods!

<h3>Temperature-Adjusting Mattress</h3>
<p>— Zeng Xiu</p>
<p>According to news from New's Scientific Pictorial magazine, inventors have recently created a mattress equipped with temperature-adjusting equipment. This news is really good news for those who like to sleep soundly. Inside that mattress, there is a novel device that can maintain a constant temperature, so it is warm in winter and cool in summer, making people who sleep on the bed feel comfortable all over. The body of the sleeping person is half-wrapped by that mattress, up to the waist, and there is no risk of overheating or overcooling, whether in winter or summer. Inside the mechanism that controls the plague degree regulator, there is a kind of electrical component, whose function is similar to the same kind of component in electric clocks, radios, toasters and electric stove pans.</p>

<p>Eleven Midnight Song</p>
<p>"Dad! Dad! I don't dare anymore! Please forgive me this time!" Thanks to Mei Bao rushing in front of him, he immediately knelt on the ground, hugged his two legs that had not yet recovered their original shape after the illness, and pleaded while crying with tears in his eyes. "Good Dad! I really didn't expect to make you so angry. Your illness hasn't fully recovered yet, please don't be too serious with me! If I go to study opera tomorrow, you can beat me to death and I won't complain..."</p>
<p>Mei Bao's burst of crying and shouting gradually awakened Qiu Haitang's reason.</p>
<p>"Dad, good Dad, sit down and rest for a while! From today on, I will never go to the Meng family again!" Mei Bao knelt on the ground and continued to sob.</p>
<p>Although reason has gradually recovered, the anger that has burned all over the body is not easy to suppress for a while; Qiu Haitang lowered his head, widened his eyes, looked at Mei Bao's face with tears and snot, and did not say a word for a long time.</p>
<p>"Dad, are you still unwilling to forgive me? My original intention was to learn opera so that we can live a more comfortable life in the future. Since Dad doesn't want me to study, isn't that easy? As long as I don't go! Fortunately, the teacher wants me to write a note..."</p>
<p>"Write a note?" Qiu Haitang's eyes widened even more, and a kind of panic and fear was fully revealed.</p>
<p>"No, Dad, I didn't write it!" Mei Bao wiped the tears from his face with his sleeves, and replied without time to spare. "Uncle Shang's uncle originally said that this piece of paper must be written by you in person, so it has been delayed until now." (176)</p>

<h3>Song Ya Hani Returns to the Screen After Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>"Skating Queen" Song Ya Hani has been on the silver screen since "Phoenix Dance on Silver Ice". Because her skating skills are exquisite and beautiful, she has become popular in the film city, and her silver screen career has been smooth sailing. In 1938, she was ranked third among the "Top Ten Box Office Stars", second only to Shirley Temple and Clark Gable. In her first three works, "Phoenix Dance on Silver Ice", "Silver Dance Queen", and "Ice and Snow Jinghong", the main focus was on magnificent and great skating scenes, while the plot and structure were relatively important, so in terms of the audience, it is inevitable to feel the need to change the taste. Song Ya Hani herself and the company authorities were aware of this, so her fourth work, "Night Blooming Flower", is different from her previous works. In other words, "Night Blooming Flower" has surpassed any previous film in terms of the compactness of the plot and the sophistication of the structure in the performance form. However, the box office has not improved, and at the same time, Song Ya Hani has been widely reported to have married Tan Tuoping, a young rich man in New York.</p>
<p>Now there is news that Song Ya Hani has decided to continue acting after marriage, but she said that if her future is not smooth, then she will decide to leave the limelight. Now her new work has begun shooting, named "Sun Valley". 20th Century Fox spent 50,000 US dollars to build a skating rink for this film for her to practice. Her skating costume has become a costume similar to a bathrobe. Song Ya Hani said: "I found that this kind of tight-fitting clothes makes me skate more comfortably and can increase my speed by one time." In this film, in addition to contributing skating skills, Song Ya Hani will also sing a song, and the skating floor has also been changed from a silver-white color to a novel and unique black floor. This film is Song Ya Hani's work after marriage to change the style, let's wait and see!</p>
<p>Daqian Society</p>
<h3>Mei School Tsing Yi Gathering and Unaccompanied Singing</h3>
<p>— Ruoqi</p>
<p>Wu Dou, Li Jiashan, and Li Shishan brothers play amateur opera and are all skilled in Tsing Yi. They love to play the strings. On their bath days, they invited more than ten famous Mei School amateurs and erhu masters in Shanghai to the Daqian Society for a banquet and a grand unaccompanied singing performance. Many talented people gathered in one room, talking to each other. As the strings moved, the high singing reached the clouds. In this isolated island life, which is boring and monotonous, this gathering is an extraordinary event. The author has been playing the qin for fifteen years, and although his skills still need to be improved, he did not expect to be invited because of the resonance of the ying wu. At two o'clock, I took the qin to go. The host, the Li brothers, were already there. After a while, Zhu Qinghui from Changsha, Zhu Qinggong, as well as Wen Keli, Li Baosun, Bao Youdie, Li Shiwen, Zhou Dongshan, Wang Rulin, and Lu Jusheng arrived one after another, and then the unaccompanied singing began.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Bao Youdie sang the Allegro and Inverted Allegro Slow Allegro of Princess Tie Jing. I and Shi Shan played the society. Youdie's voice was as clear as before, and it had a cracked tone, which was extraordinary. Shi Shan's erhu was also closely connected. Then Zhou Dongshan sang the Spring and Autumn Allegro. The qin player was Wang Rulin, an erhu amateur from Nanjing. Youdie harmonized with the erhu, which was stable and pleasing. Then Lu Jusheng sang the first part of the Tale of Genji, and Wen Keli and Zhu Qinggong cooperated to play the qin. Zhu's erhu had a particularly loud tone and no anger at all. Mr. Wen's huqin was also tightly wrapped, which was very enjoyable to listen to. Again, Li Baosun sang Life and Death Hate, and his old partners, the Zhu brothers, played for him. The two of them started and stopped their bows together, strictly like Wang Xu, which was not easy. Shi Sun's skills have been improving rapidly recently, and his good looks and suitable figure are unanimously recognized by the ticket industry. The only regret is that his singing style is deeply influenced by Xun and cannot be purely based on the Mei method. This meeting started at half past two and ended at half past seven. In such hot summer, the gentlemen sang and pulled, and no one said a word of "heat," which shows that their elegance is not shallow. On this day, the unaccompanied singing was all Tsing Yi, and there were very few old students. There was a joker in the seat who said that it was Yin Sheng Yang decline, and he could not stop smiling when he heard it. There is one more thing that I regret very much, that is, Yang Wanong, the leading Mei School amateur, is far away in the accompanying capital and cannot participate, and Ni Qiuping, the famous huqin master who is close at hand, and Shen Bainian, who was personally taught by Mei, did not come, which is a fly in the ointment.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiongpa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Refusing to Bow Down in the Grassroots</p>
<p>After a while, the wine and food were set up. When it was time to eat, Xu Jing was hungry and did not be polite, and sat down with Liu Yinying to eat and drink together. Zhang Cangqiu also asked about Li Xin's news. Xu Jing had not yet known about Li Xin's fall from the car, and said that there was no news, and he did not know whether he was dead or alive. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei could not help but sigh. They thought that Li Xin must have met with misfortune, but who knew that Li Xin was on Qingxi Mountain, newly married with Hong Niangzi, and dominating the green forest? Xu Jing's father asked the two about their recent situation. Zhang Cangqiu replied: "After we rushed to this place, we met my friend Chai Ying. He is working as a guerrilla here. Seeing that we came when we were called, he was very happy, so he led us to see General Wu. That General Wu is indeed romantic and suave, not a clumsy person. He is stationed here and can still live in peace with Manchuria. Manchuria also does not dare to start a war rashly because they have heard of General Wu's fame. His subordinates have more than 10,000 people, who can fight when advancing and defend when retreating, and can still be called a strong army. We two have been entrusted by General Wu with the position of general. Although we have been able to live here, we hate that there is no opportunity to try our copper tendons and iron ribs. If the Tartars come to invade sooner or later, I will definitely kill him happily." Xu Jing heard this, and toasted Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei each a cup with Liu Yinying. He also said to Zhang Cangqiu: "Brother Liu and I came here, but we just wanted to do something for the country and make a career for ourselves. Since General Wu is a contemporary hero and worthy of relying on, we can also settle down here and are willing to follow the two brothers and jointly hold the weapons. But I don't know where General Wu has gone at the moment, when will he return? Is there anything important?" Zhang Cangqiu said: "This time General Wu was summoned to Beijing. Yesterday, there was news that the emperor had sealed General Wu as the Earl of Pingxi, and entrusted him with great importance. General Wu is grateful for the kindness of knowing and meeting him, and he will definitely be able to spare no effort to repay the master." Chen Fei said: "We and others have heard that the power of the bandits in the customs has become a prairie fire, and we often want General Wu to ask the court to send troops to suppress the bandits and eliminate the hidden dangers. It is a pity that General Wu has not been able to promote the realization of this proposal." Xu Jing sighed: "Internal troubles are indeed worrying, but external troubles cannot be ignored. Manchuria is on the rise, Feng Zhi Chang Snake, recommending food to the upper country, ambitious and ready to move, I am afraid that General Wu will not be easily moved either." Liu Yinying also nodded in agreement. Alas! The four heroes were worried about the affairs of the country and were discussing the situation outside the customs, and they had great hope for Wu Sangui. How did they know that in this time of four suburbs and many fortresses, and the state of the earth, the romantic and elegant General Wu was in Beijing, lamenting silk and hao bamboo, selecting dance and recruiting songs, and obsessed with a peerless beauty?

<h3>On the Past and Present of Women's Yue Opera (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jintao</p>
<p>In addition to the advantages, I think there are also several weaknesses. ——At least it is not perfect——I am from Shaoxing, I love Shaoxing, and I want to help the Yue Opera circle even more, so I write it down, hoping that everyone in the front and back stages will pay attention to improvement.</p>
<p>(1) Tune</p>
<p>The tunes sung are too simple, lacking in change. After two or three short sentences, a long sentence follows. The end of the long sentence is always an "A" sound. Listening to this is like listening to a proclamation. It is easy to understand, but listening for a long time will feel boring and tired.——The tune is not as varied as Shenqu——My opinion is that it needs to be increased, changed, turned, and changed to make it lively and vivid. The words and tone may retain the local accent, and the tunes can be copied as much as possible, just like the inclusion of bangzi and Kunqiang in Pihuang... It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to bring everyone together in one furnace.</p>
<p>(2) Interlude</p>
<p>In some places, there are too many duets and dialogues, which are tiring for the singers and disappointing for the listeners. The play "Pan Fu" is an example. Two or three people sing for more than an hour, which is really too dull. In this kind of place, the screenwriter should use his intelligence to intersperse some relaxed actions to grab the audience's attention and interest.</p>
<p>(3) Other</p>
<p>Since Mei Lanfang of the Peking Opera circle prepared the stage curtain himself, the general famous actors have followed suit. This is not too critical. However, the flower pattern should not be too vulgar, like a wedding hall. The same embroidery and the same money. It is better to ask a beauty guard to design and draw a pattern. The color should not be too much, and the pattern should be simple and generous. How beautiful it is to hang it up!——Table skirts and chair covers need to be improved. As for "the affairs of men and women", do not perform them in a way that is close to pornography. There are ways to avoid direct performances in these places. Speaking of the front stage, although it is not a fundamental problem of Yue Opera, it is also very related. The "singing" of women's Yue Opera is not high. If the viewers cannot be quiet, it will affect the drama. Therefore, it is best for children to buy tickets, and even if they are holding babies, they must also pay full tickets, so that servants without knowledge will bring less; there will be no crying children; the whole audience is quiet, and the lyrics are sent to people's eardrums, which easily makes people feel good and can absorb a lot of Zhou Lang. There are also stage lights, which can imitate the success of the spoken drama stage. When the play starts, all the lights in the front stage, except for the ones outside the Taiping Gate and the toilet, are turned off. In this way, the audience's eyesight is not damaged, and it can also help the implementation of "silence."</p>
<p>(Editor's note) Mr. Jintao's opinions on the current situation and improvement of Yue Opera are practical and thorough, and are really rare concrete methods. For the sake of protecting the future of Yue Opera, we hope that Yue Opera practitioners and screenwriters and directors will pay close attention to it.</p>
