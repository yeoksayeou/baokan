<p>合衆社二十三日巴達維亞電　本日調查所知、東印度荷人對於日本東條內閣之成立、非常冷淡、官方之非正式評論、曾表露事態嚴重、但對於最近之將來、並無憂懼、荷印領袖則不打宣述官方對於日本最近內閣變動之意見、荷文報紙亦依照此項一般之意旨、警吿爪哇民衆謂、有發生任何事故之可能、但並未反映特別憂慮、數日之前、荷人對於日本之發展或有不同之觀感、但現時荷印之居民已有充分之確信心、彼等曾見彼等之軍隊已發展爲有力之機械化軍隊、並有無數美國運來之戰鬥飛機爲之後盾、英·美及澳洲之參謀官員、仍源源來至荷印、彼等常常談及共局進攻及美·英·中·荷陣綫巳經屢决聽聞之「維持原狀但勿觸忤日本」之口號、似已被遺忘、而代之以嚴肅之絨默、消息靈通方面稱、荷印防務所僅存之困難、爲缺乏一確實簽訂之民主國共同防務協定、某重要荷人語記者稱、「如英。美肯以書面應允遇吾人被攻擊時、與吾人以援助、則反對日本南進之堅決立塲之最後障碍、即可除去云、</p>
<h3>日在越南邊境　建軍事根據地</h3>
<p>路透社二十三日盤古電　政治色彩各異之秦國日報兩家、今日皆載有越南日軍在泰國邊界附近調動之消息、斯利克倫報稱、西貢勃倫本等與泰國邊界相距不遠之處、皆有日兵出動、大的日軍將在勃倫本地方建造軍事根據地云，蘇巴般斯報稱、日軍已從河內與越南南部調至湄公河越南方面之邊界、由巴克斯而至西貢之主要公路、現爲日軍所使用、僅訐有軍事交通云、</p>

<h3>東條新閣雖組成　日本態度仍持重　對華戰事冀早結束</h3>
<p>路透社二十三日華盛頓電東京近日傳來之消息、明白表示新閣雖已組成、然日本仍爲日本、東條內閣在職數日、日本依然持重、但準備於任何機會發生時設法利用之、日本政權雖在陸軍掌握中、但內閣中未有眞正極端份子、亦未羅致偏向軸心之特殊人物、雖有更急進政策之可能、然迄未作趨向此途之步驟、日本眞正局勢之最好徵象、似爲德國對於日本未有利於柏林計畫的發展之失望、消息靈通之每週外交通訊謂、東條未以親善軸心之許多著名日人延入內閣、而仍繼續美日談話、德國對此頗覺惶遽不安、</p>
<p>對蘇施展　神經戰爭</p>
<p>華盛頓人士相信、日本之唯一關切、在增進其在歐戰中之地位、至於此種目的是吾聯合軸心國、抑聯合民治國而達到之、則爲决要的考慮問題、現有理由可信、日本之政策、在以有限的壓力加諸民治國、以視有何反響、大的日本將加强其在越南之地位、一面注視英美之反響、日本或更將對泰有所舉動、以擾英國、俾查知英國援泰拒日之程度、同時日本將對蘇聯施展神經戰、以散布日軍集中滿洲之消息、而日本報紙則作日本在西伯利亞有傳統的權利之宣傳云、該外交通訊又謂、東條政府現正以談判和平之意向重慶接洽、蓋以中國鑒於美日談話不無惶慮、故日本乘機有此舉也、惟此間人士覺日本今欲以任何代價結束在華戰爭、但不久則仍將對華作戰、以補其和平運動之不足云、此外交通訊之言也、要知凡熟悉遠東事件者、皆覺中國如果有此惶慮、則殊不必、蓋彼等認美日談話、乃凍結現有關係之努力、而非成立折中的妥洽之努力也、談話之繼續、無非在最後決裂前拖延時日之舉動耳、一</p>
<p>美決斷續　援華作戰</p>
<p>吾人須知美國實力允其是海軍、現方逐日加强、再美日談話令後將由國務幫辦威爾斯與日參贊若杉進行之、而國務卿赫爾與日大使野村、則須俟確有可討論者時始親自折衝、此種事實已可見美日談話之初步的或試探的性質矣、吾人尙有須知者、日本在其大軍陷於中國泥津中、而此對華戰爭依然消耗日本資源時、不能有充分力量與第一等國作戰、美國苟得可使日本在華疲於奔命之保證、則對華援助必繼續增多、中國對日作戰愈力、則中國愈可多得美國之援助、華盛頓方面確未有出賣中國之趨向、如當局果有此政策、則必遭全國之反對、可無疑也、德方現正誘引日人、以爲美國商船可毀、美國軍艦可擊、而美國絕未發生眞正鼓噪、東京何必以美國爲慮、因美國決不能在兩個陣綫作戰、故亦未必在任何一陣綫作戰也、德方此言是吾確當、將來自可證明之或不久即有分曉、未可知也、</p>
<p>日德觀察　大相逕庭</p>
<p>路透社二十二日倫教電　秦晤七報華盛頓訪電　稱、據華府可恃消息、自東條內閣成立後、東京德人屢欲日政府發表重申日本依附軸心之正式言論、但至今未遂其謀、且聞蘇德戰爭發生以來、德方常許日方觀察家獲有爲英美所不能得之種種情報與觀察、而東京對於蘇德戰爭結果之見解、則殆與柏林所宣傳者、在要點上大相逕庭、而與哈立曼星期一日向美總統報告者相近、就事態察之、東條與其閣員、顯欲愼重將事、聞日皇且諭其在有關對美關係之事件上勿魯莽從事、據衆猜測、日本目前之最大旨趣、大的將在軍事上與政治上、以各種壓力加諸中國、冀結束中國事件、今且有人傳說、東京與蔣委員長左右、確巳有若干接觸、刻在研究中、</p>
<p>美婦女團體請　調解中日戰爭</p>

<h3>「到西北去」！　朱家驊廣播演詞</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）朱部長家驊九月廿五日在中央廣播電台播講，題爲「到西北去」，原詞錄次：</p>
<p>諸位聽衆，我剛從西北各省長期旅行回來，西北的情形是值得介紹給諸位的。我們不到西北，不知西北的偉大，也就不見中國的偉大。沒有到過西北的，有些人常有兩種不正確的觀念，第一以爲西北是我們的邊疆，第二以爲西北是一片荒凉的地方，這是大錯特錯的。從中國整個地形來說，西北是我們的腹地，蘭州纔是全國的中心，所以總理孫先生從前有過建都蘭州的擬議。我們的國家到處都是</p>
<p>錦繡河山，西北不特不是例外，而且如果我們的國家缺少了他，便不行的。我們要知道西北是人文薈萃之地，沃野膏腴，呈現在我們的眼前講到中國民族發達的歷史，西北更是最有價值的了。原來西北是我國文化發祥地，歷代尤其是秦漢唐的文物制度，豐功價績，都建樹在這一帶地方。所以我們在西北到處都可看到古蹟，在甘肅的河西一帶，更可以看到我們祖先開疆闢土的精神，和各種遺跡，像古長城，千佛洞，和種種稀世之寶，如木簡，佛經，手卷，和壁畫等等。所以敦煌更是世界有名的考古勝地，是各國考古學家窮年累月所研究的對象。西北氣候，最適宜於人體的健康，即使一個人整天不斷的工作，因爲氣候的舒適，也不會感覺疲倦。我想有病的人一</p>
<p>到西北去，也必然很快的會恢復他的健康。看看西北同胞們身體的壯健，能吃苦耐勞，眞使我們南方的同胞們望塵莫及。西北蘊藏着無窮盡的寶藏，沒有開發的礦產很多，地面上的生產，可以說是應有盡有。加以黃河及各種渠流的灌溉，土地益增肥美，種植茂盛，收穫充實，一切農作物皆與土壤和氣候適宜，眞可謂種瓜得瓜，百物滋長了！我們在那裏可以看見種樹造林正在開始進行中，有幾處規模宏大。我們更可以看見以千百計的牛羊羣和結隊載運的駱駝，這些都是別的地方不易見到的。至於內地制宜的手工業，加毛紡織等等是西北所特有的，近來各種機器工業，各地都有舉辦，並且不斷增加。到西北經營</p>
<p>各種事業都有很好的環境和很多的機會，你夫從事科學事業，到處都是處女地，可以創作和發現新東西：你去從事敎育，那裏師資最感缺乏，到處受人歡迎，你去辦報，辦刊物，大家正在衆口同聲的要求「文人」去：你去務農或墾殖，荒地很多，地價很賤；你去開工廠，競爭極少，工資尤廉，你去經商，各樣買賣都好做，交通四達，還有國際路綫……總之，到西北去不愁沒有事做，而且做起車來，一定是很順利的。諸位：西北地大物博，但人口的密度還很不够，西北極需要的是人力，假使西北地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流的話，非大量增加人力不爲功。我們要開發西北，就要實行到曲北去。這樣不僅盡了國民的資仟，個人的事業和個人的生活問題。也都可迎刃而解。那裏各種事業的機會很多，生活程度也較低，容易立身立業。以上所說的，都是我這次親自到西北去考察後所得的感想，希望同胞們風起雲湧，趕快到西北去工作！</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>援蘇路線的安全問題</h3>
<p>步隨着蘇德戰事的激烈進行，如何加緊援蘇，已成一極迫切之問題。對蘇聯具有同盟關係的英國，旣認爲一時還沒有在陸地上建立第二戰塲的可能，而僅能出動其空軍，以破壞德國之後方，運用其海軍，以確保海洋之控制，然則直接援蘇的任務，主要的自有賴於美國之達成。美國赴蘇代表團領袖哈立曼氏，近已返美，謁見羅總統，對蘇聯作戰力量，表示深刻之信任，但也坦白陳述蘇聯急需戰具之補充，和物質之援助。據前日路透社華盛頓電訉，美總統對於哈立曼氏報告，完全同意，且已下令加速並擴大對蘇聯之援助。所以美國的積極援蘇，在本質上原來不成問題；目前所尙成爲問題的，只杲這些援蘇物品的運輸問題，尤其是運輸路綫的安全問題。</p>
<p>蘇聯的對外交通、向來依賴四重門戶，就是北方的亞爾干日爾，西方的列甯格勒，南方的敖得薩，和東方的海參崴。現時列甯格勒和敖得薩，無論其是吾仍在蘇聯手中，因爲出海通路的阻塞，都根本沒有利用的可能，而亞爾干日爾位置較僻，冰期較長（每年達一百七十日），且其對外航綫須經挪威北岸，今挪威處德軍占領下，行船危險殊多。所以海參崴對於蘇聯的重要性，也即西比利亞區域對於蘇聯的重要性，現在實已大大增加了。海寥崴和歐俄本部之間，本有西比利亞大鐵路爲之聯繫，然此路東段，沿黑龍江省邊境建造，易受日本破壞，故近年蘇聯又築成一條貝穆鐵路，起自貝加爾湖區之塔什脫，與西比利亞鐵路相接，東經科蘇木爾斯克，而至蘇維埃港（在海參崴北）。而海參崴及蘇維埃港對於更在北方的廟街及堪察加半島，其交通亦頻有發展。所以蘇聯極東部分的對外門戶，現時是充分可以吸收援蘇物品的。</p>
<p>但是軸心德國在遠東方面、早有一番勾結，一番布置。蘇聯的海參崴或蘇維埃港，乃至整個的濱海省，實全處於受包圍的形勢下。蘇聯的遠東駐軍，固被認爲具有自衛之實力，可是此一區域內蘇聯交通機構之遭遇到外來的嚴重威脅，要亦不容否認。昨天華盛頓電稱，美國航務委員會已宣布暫時放棄海參崴之接濟蘇聯路線，而改道亞爾干日爾；美官方旣吾認此種改變爲對日讓步，則其實質的意義，未嘗不可以解釋爲已感受到一種外來威脅。因爲就西比利亞鐵路的輸送力量判斷，倘謂海參崴儲油量已達飽和點、是不易令人置信的；何况亞爾干日爾的設備及環境，也並不合理想。現時蘇聯於勢旣急需大量吸入美國援助品，則對於疏通美蘇間的交通，並確保其安全，當然要全力以赴。</p>
<p>爲求避免受軸心集團之强烈威脅，蘇聯除了取道亞爾干日爾外，其對美國的交通，尙有兩途可循：一是通過白令海峽及蘇聯極北區，二是取道印度洋及伊蘭高原。（一）關於前者，白令海峽只有五十哩左右的寬度，通過不難，而蘇聯極北區的交通，近年亦經積極之開發，設有一大北方海運管理處」（Glawsevmorputj），自一九三九年以來，由巴巴寗氏任處長職，他不但管理該區之交通　務，兼且握有科學的和軍事的大權。現時蘇境極北的波立納衣（在麥孟斯克附近），普洛維登斯角（在阿拉斯加對面），及彼得羅帕夫羅夫斯克（在堪察加半島上）三地，皆已建大規模的海陸軍根據地，彼得羅帕夫羅夫斯克尤針對着日本；而强大的空軍根據地，也已建立於狄克孫島，鄂畢多斯克，諾維港，惠倫，及波舍里决科（在堪察加半島上）諸地。蘇聯一面在北極區設了許多海上兵站，一面更加緊開發陸上交通，並且又布置了稱為一史達林航空綫」的航空綱。這一切，再經一番調整，則蘇聯和美國阿拉斯加間的交通，便直接而且緊密聯擊起來了。（二）關於後者，又有二途：其一經印度阿富汗以通中亞，另一取道伊朗。伊朗的公路相當發達，由波斯灣至裏海的縱貫鐵道也已於前年築成，與蘇聯高加索區銜接。今冬氣候轉寒，德蘇戰局重心定將南移，那時伊期交通綫將更增其重要。所以最近　蘇的聯合進兵伊期，驅除納粹第五縱隊，而控制其交通，實具重大之戰略意義。</p>
<p>但是這兩條新的援蘇路綫—或通過白令海峽及極北區，或通過印度洋及伊蘭高原—在數量上和效率上，恐怕仍都不能與取道海參崴及西比利亞大鐵路者相比較。且即使這兩條新的路綫，也仍未能謂爲可以完全不受遠東軸心國家之剽襲。所以現時美國援蘇，儘管可以有數平行路綫，而對於此諸路綫的安全，依然不能不作最根本之考慮，且終不能不聯合中美蘇英諸國，共謀撲滅遠東之軸心國的破壞勢力。這一點，應當是最近將來遠東大局整個發展中的一個重要關鍵。</p>

<p>金雙馬暴漲漫無止境、雖通吿先交證金、而未能節制收買之氣燄、廠單連漲停板已四日、人心惶惶、空頭不及抵補、新多者當亦縮手、故市價雖昂、而交易轉稀、期紗晨開十一月期因隔昨未有漲足、開出即吿漲停板爲二二六九元、十二月二二九〇元、高五十二元、旋會做低至二二五八元、一月份二二八〇元、後以取引所上落靡定、乃亦降至二二七〇元、午收已各升三五十至百兀不等、午後近期追證齊後、再度開做、雖廠單無市、但以取引所於收盤時標布突升停板、人心又議上、十一月份猛升至二三五五元收市、竟劇漲一百八上五元、上二月二三五八元、一月份二三五五元、各好一百元、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>停止新買後　搜囤現布愈急</h3>
<p>廠布　咋市因取引所停止新買賣、囤戶搜羅現布益見緊迫、而本街門市及淪陷區實需基盛、致布價暴騰、如醉如在、白貨粗細布斜紋每疋漲五元至七元二角半、開布市歷來漲價之新紀錄、漂染布及綸昌怡和印染布疋因廠方觀望、手貨求過於供、甚少做開、本街成一交各布千數百件、惟浙東定海寗波及南京杭州等淪陷區需貨雖殷、而領搬出證仍感困難、</p>
<p>東布　白貨期布停止新交易後、現貨市塲頓形熱鬧、蓋業外囤戶鑒於黃金飛騰、漫無止境、此拉彼抬、愈漲愈烈、龍頭細布新單晚收在升至八十五元七角、其他雜牌細布細斜每疋亦俱各漲起六七元不等、四君子嗶嘰晨盤二元八角左右、逐步上升至晚售見三元一角五分、但漲風太暴、反動亦易耳、</p>
<h3>似此漲風　究屬何為</h3>
<p>此决漲風、起於雙十節假後開關、荏苒二星期、大非當時面目、茲將昨日價及比前日所漲、又與十一日行市比列於後、</p>
<h3>米價狂跳　無一不超過公賣米　公賣米質恐有問題</h3>
<p>怡和洋行阜生輸、咋日下午二時許到埠、由香港裝來洋米五千一百包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米漲風愈見騰踊、晨開即見最高價、一度盤旋後冉見拾級上升、英華司前日未曾漲足、更見鋒鋩、小絞路貨開價即爲一百七十八元、繼自一百八十元、到一百八十二元、則比前午正式價跳起十二元之鉅、小絞現貨一百五十元開價到一百五十五元、一號西貢一百六十四五元到七十元、二號一百五十一二元到九十七八元、均比前晚暗盤漲七八元、午後買氣加旺、囤胃更貪、市價一度再加二三元、然因工部局以結到外匯、續有九千噸小絞以前盤一百三十九元七角六分電洽、據傳有成議可能、因此人心轉平、市價回平二三元、晚收乃與午收相等、全日成交計有三萬多包、又一千六七白噸、其他如一號退邏開一百六十五元、二號一百五十二元、敏黨一百五十七元至一百五十四元半、銀棧小絞一百五十五元半、外棧一百五十四元半。一百五十四元、碎尖高自一百二十三元、次至一百二十元、亦比工部局小絞米爲高、遂使百分之四十碎米標準、似乎近來市上所售、恐不止此數、因見碎粒格外多、有謂此亦必然之趨勢、現在一百五十八斤之小絞米要賣一百五十餘元、工部局米一百六十斤只賣一百十七元、比碎米尙錢、那得使市上所售不爲變質、何况工部局米之成色、一般食戶、只知米店說是此等貨、即是此等貨、「盲子看畫壁」、無從辨別其好壞、是以要辦公賣、只許有一個、不許有例外、纔有辦法、可是慣於做生意的、不論中西、總是從生意着眼、此一週內洋米價一路飛升、達二十餘元、且比上春最高峰亦已穿出十餘元</p>
<p>厚薄新破兩粳、暴騰十數元、計開南港早破及崑山新粳與夫靑角窰種楓涇百哥均達一百七十八元、而泗涇野稻因兩朝時鮮、尤爲出色、售開一百八十元、不過早市初開、價有參差、均在一百七十三四元至一百七十一元左右、</p>
<p>糯米比前僅增三四元、開香港白元高自一百八十二元、次至一百七十八元、黃色高元祇一百七十五元、不過糯茶、在貨稀不敷分配之下、市價遂續飛漲七八元、開高自一百七十二元半、次至一百六十九元、</p>
<p>麵粉買氣蓬勃、投機尤見活躍、砲臺開價即爲四十五元九角、繼至六元、金龍自四十四元五七角漲達四十五元、午後獲利多頭鑒於平賣之必須實現、乃趁高回出、市乃回小一二角、收市砲臺四十五元八九角、黃金四十五元、金龍四十四元八丸角、均比前市大七八角、成交仍有七八萬包、</p>
<p>不斷食糖向北流　市價乃刺激昂漲</p>
<p>近日糖價銳漲、雖云是金市高漲刺激所致、然尙有其他二種原因、（一）華北方面、因不能獲致外滙、故糖之直接購辦數量見减、而需要則反之增旺、遂趨而之滬市搬運、故前日甫有食糖進口、而今午即由太古公司凉州輸裝運二萬零三百包赴津、更有怡和洋行阜生輪、昨日到滬、由香港裝來砂糖一千八百包、明日仍由原船運往天津、可見食糖由滬運往華北之數之多、市價安得不隨之而升、（二）由於搬運愈廣、引起囤戶居奇之念、故雖高價迭出、而囤藏不衰、因囤藏不衰、而市價更高、循環因果、致糖價之高乃不可嚮邇惟、昨日因有囤戶趁高稍有出籠、趨勢轉平、</p>

<h3>英僑擁護管理理物價　建議組進口協會</h3>
<p>零售商倘抬價氣絕供貨　對當局措施公衆應協助</p>
<p>工部局議決委祥茂洋行籌辦平價麪粉</p>
<p>英僑協會會於二十一日、在外灘二十七號會所、舉行每兩星期召集一决之例會、由考拉氏主席、決定於下月七日下午五時半、在跑馬廳舉行年會、屆時英總領喬治、將出席演說戰時基金問題、</p>
<p>公衆同情有裨實益</p>
<p>席間復討論管理物價問題、認爲英僑協會對當局之措施、應竭誠擁護、蓋公衆之同情、可以協助當局、克服甚多之困難也、有人以爲現時擾亂物價者、零售商實佔其大部、故建議組織一進口商人協會、對於違反法定價格者、拒絕供給貨物、此舉對於管理零售物價、必大有助益云、</p>
<p>委托祥茂籌辦平粉</p>
<p>公共界界工部局、於上週舉行特別會議時、曾議決仿照出售平價港米辦法、繼續辦理出售平便麵粉、茲據大中社記者探悉、工部局刻仍委托英商祥茂洋行籌辦其事、該行現已開始調查本市經售麵粉之批發行家、及零售商店之營業情形與銷數、一俟調查竣事、即呈報當局備查、同時、工部局方面、現正請求平準會申請供給外滙、運銷麵粉、據銀行界消息、平準會可予以核准、</p>
<p>供滙之後售價可跌</p>
<p>據記者調查、本市每日麵粉實銷數目爲一萬袋、每月的需三十萬袋、目下每袋價格、因受投機份子之操縱、已售至四十餘元、若能獲得法定外滙、則其售價、當可减低十餘元、聞此項平價麵粉、係由香港某大麵粉廠供給、該廠規模甚大、以之供給本市所需要之麵粉、當可無虞匱乏、又悉、本市阜豐福新兩麵粉廠、因內地小麥來源全被日方壟斷、已停工數月、致本市食用之麵粉來源、須由美國澳洲等處運滬、致價格遂被投機份子所操縱、</p>

<p>炸彈已觸其肩　幸未爆炸墮地</p>
<p>密勒氏評論報主筆美國人飽戚爾J．B．Powell、在遠東從事記者生涯有年、主持正義、素負盛譽、鮑之寓所、在福州路花旗總會、其事務所則在愛多亞路一百六十號、每日往返辦公室及寓所、以路途匪遙、嘗徒步往來、最近鮑以環境非佳、特僱一保鐵、隨身侍衛、乃昨日下午七時、鮑與保鑣自愛多亞路辦公室出外、步行至四川路、在下內門大厦鬥前、忽有人從後面向彼擲一紙包、正觸其肩、當卽墮地、鮑大爲驚異、亟俯身探視、見地上係一報紙所包之紙包、拆開一看、乃赫然爲一手溜彈、幸未爆炸、其保鑣返身查看、則擲彈者已不知所往、聞飽近在密勒氏評論報上曾作一文、頗多牽涉、或卽爲此次擲彈之所由來也、</p>

<h3>僑滬協約國人民　盡力捐輸國難</h3>
<p>婦女集體工作編織衣襪　英僑搜售廢紙得款滙英</p>

<h3>美法商輪經營不輟　南洋航運敏捷</h3>
<p>海外交通毫無停滯跡象　世界班輪縮短滬美航程</p>
<p>爲一般人密切注意之上海海外交通及貨運問題目前並未因局勢傾向而有惡化之象、據新聲社記者昨自航業界之權威方面探悉、上海之海外交通路綫、與嚴重之階段、相差尙遠、目前海外交通路綫之繼續維持者、或戰後新興者、計有（一）美國總統郵船公司、暨其代理之美國先鋒輪船公司。美郵公司·曁魯根勃滋輪船公司。等之美國遠東綫、所屬輪船除總輪外、如亞伐拉號·弗萊脫雷號·桃樂賽號·及哈萊號·等均在內、（二）法國輪船公司之大達南開庭·及金第亞·輪等、行統駛西貢上海綫、（三）渣華郵船公司之上海香港·爪哇綫、輪船如芝沙丹尼號等、（四）達拉雷瑪綫、如加拉大·卡地那·卡蒙那·及卡倍那等輪、行駛上海·香港·馬尼刺·洛杉磯·及紐的間、（五）KPN綫、由渣華公司代理、所屬輪船由滬駛澳洲·新西蘭。及南菲洲等、現均至香港轉口、（六）盤恩斯腓而普綫之滬澳綫、（七）華倫洋行之南洋綫、所屬之格蘭輪挪斯商人輪等、行駛滬貢滬緬之問、（八）日木郵船株式會社及大阪商船株式會社等、以上數家輪公司、貨運範圍、包括美國·加拿大·菲列濱·香港·馬萊·南洋·澳洲·越南·南菲·等數處、他如歐洲國家、事實上不能直達、祇能由美國轉運、但其重要性也大不如前、</p>
<p>太平洋上美旗飄揚</p>
<p>以上數家輪船之往來、雖水脚增高、但始終能保持貨運無虞中斷、在太平洋上、目下美輪首屈一指、加拿大·美國·火奴魯魯·菲列濱·香港·及上海之間、美旗飄揚、所在皆是、因局勢變幻莫測、故此種輪船之使命極大、蓋自英國全力注意於大西洋方面後、如昌興輪船公司之俄國·日本·亞細亞·坎拿大·等皇后輪、暨大英輪船公司之郵輪、悉自太平洋上撒退、被調回服務軍運、因此英輪原駛之航綫、全由美輪代之、雖美總統輪多隻被徵軍用美航務委員會仍趕緊建造新輪二百艘、期於年內完成、分配兩洋、維持航運、如上述之亞伐那輪及茀萊脫電輪等、均爲新建者、故太平洋上之貨運、仍可保持常態、至美郵船行程行期保守秘密、祗爲策謀安全、與航運之進行無關、</p>
<p>南洋货運力求敏捷</p>
<p>在南洋航運方面、最重要者即爲上述法航。渣華·華倫·盤恩斯、美郵之滬港馬尼刺綫、及世界班綫等等、此區內最富有工商性質之港口爲香港·馬尼刺·新嘉坡·西貢·仰光·海防·爪哇·墨爾缽各地、南洋之貿易、就目前之情形言之、對　關係殊爲密切、主要航商全由美荷法三國擔任、唯自遠東局勢一度轉緊以後、荷輪有停駛遠東之說、但迄未廓淸、法國航務公司方面各輪、一般由西貢或海防直放上海、不靠香港、有時繼續自滬駛日、主要任務爲裝載米煤等必需品、美商之滬港菲綫、及世界班綫、頗爲有力、最近亦有輪專放新嘉坡者、查美總統公司之世界班、其正班航綫爲波士敦·紐的·巴拿馬運河·洛杉磯·舊金山·火奴魯魯·上海（目下美輪一概不灣日本）、香港·馬尼刺·新嘉坡·錫蘭·孟買·南菲好望角、越大西洋返美、此綫環繞全球、上海爲其中心、於貨運助益甚大、該公司爲中美航運敏捷起見、將世界班各輪縮短航程、由美開出來滬、南駛至新嘉坡爲止、不往孟買好望角轉道返美、即由新嘉坡回駛、循原航綫返美、</p>
<p>內河航運極為黯淡</p>
<p>至內河航運、如黃浦江·蘇州河·長江·珠江等、戰前行駛輸船、各國競爭頗烈、而今則完全爲壟斷操縱、目下壟斷之公司、爲數甚多、但其輪船均簡陋、設備亦惡劣、珠江航運、亦頗黯淡、浦江蘇州河輪隻之行動、範圍更窄矣、又南北洋輪船、戰前以怡和太古等佔上、今因怡和太古輪船或有被徵爲其他用途者、且所受阻撓及限制甚嚴、故未有起色、</p>
<p>轉讓華輪八十九艘</p>
<p>又據航業界權威方面透露、戰事發生以後、華商輸船之改由洋商經營以策保護者、計八十九隻、合十三萬九千噸、其中以葡商之廿八艘一萬一千餘噸爲最多、意商十四艘、其噸數則遠超葡商、計三萬餘噸、美商一艘、祇卅一噸、茲將詳細統計錄下、（一）美商一艘、卅一噸、（二）英商三艘、八千五百六十六噸、（三）德商五艘、六千六百卅七噸、（四）意商十四艘、三萬五千八百五十七噸、（五）葡商廿八艘、一萬七千一百七十四噸、（六）挪威商七艘、二萬一千二百另九噸、（七）荷商二艘、六千五百廿五噸、（八）希臘商十五艘、三萬一千二百九十九噸、（九）其他十四艘、一寓一千八百另二噸、</p>
<h3>織廠減工</h3>
<p>江海關日籍副稅務司小山、於十月十八日起佈告禁止棉紗疋頭以及其他紡織品等出口及轉口後、上海有關各業均受極大之影饗、雖規定特許者不在此例、但欲運往香港以及南洋各地、與由仰光轉口至自由區域各地者、均遭拒絕、所能獲得特許者、爲淪陷區域各地而已、因此棉紗市塲交易實銷毫無、全爲投機者所買賣、各棉織毛巾織襪等廠、被迫停歇夜工或减工一部份、向以南洋帮爲最大顧主之有關各業、其所受打擊更甚、最近由上海駛港各外商輪船、均無棉紗及棉織品等出口、輪船公司營業亦已受影響、</p>
<p>泡立司業工潮解決</p>
<p>西式木器業泡立司工潮、巳吿圓滿解決、增加工資一項、亦已談妥、自九月份起一律普加四成半、各店工人、巳於昨日恢復工作、</p>
<h3>麺粉雖濫漲　餅饅不加價</h3>
<p>平民必需食糧　攸關一般生活</p>
<p>工部局已調查本埠現有經售麵粉號家之總數、以便來日辦理銷售事宜、其平售辦法即將實現、近日各種粉製食品暨餅乾·切麵等、均因受粉價濫漲影饗、已先後酌增售價、茲悉上海市餅饅業同業公會、昨經通吿各店主、原文云、一際此粉價高漲、成本增加、理應將零售價格酌予修改、但此次工部局對投機粉商非法抬價、已具縝密計劃、良深欽佩、查吾餅饅食品、爲全市平民日常之必需食糧、苟若再行加價、則與整個社會、生活攸關、爲特通吿各會員、在工部局平售麵粉辦法未實施前、仍希維持原價，大餅饅頭等每件以五分至一角爲限、不得私行加價、違則依照業規處罰、」</p>
<h3>日方銀行投機棉紗　虧蝕達數百萬元</h3>
<p>因江海關禁出口大事拋空　詎料反動激烈補進已不及</p>
<p>大陸報云、據商界消息、此間數家日方銀行、近在上海棉市塲作投機活動、結果虧蝕達數百萬元之鉅、先是日方銀行風聞江海關將禁止一切棉貨從滬輸出、乃在棉市塲、大事拋空活動、蓋料禁止出口之結果、棉價將趨跌也、不意禁止出口後數天、棉價激昇、並無趨疲之象、日方銀行急忙補進、惟棉價步步上漲、致虧蝕甚鉅、</p>
<h3>煤斤到九千噸　平準會對滬市應用煤斤　在需要範圍內充分供匯</h3>
<p>連日煤斤大量到滬、怡和洋行外洋部經理之巴拿馬商輪諾特號、由爪哇運來大批煤斤，已誌昨報、茲悉該公司經理之怡隆公司神佑輪、亦由荷屬東印度裝來煤斤一千八百八十噸、巳於昨晨到埠、停泊三十·三十A號浮筒起卸、太古公司三輪亦裝來大批開平煤、成都輪前日（廿二日）抵埠、由秦皇島裝來煤斤二千二百噸、蘇州輪昨日到滬、亦由秦皇島運來煤斤二千五百噸、又南寗輪與蘇州輪同日抵埠、亦由秦皇島裝來煤斤二千四百噸、三輪均靠開澳煤棧碼頭起卸、至外傳本市煤况、巳露一綫曙光、因平準會准考慮供匯之故、但平準會對本市煤斤供應，極爲注意、與米糧並重、無論何時、決不使發現煤荒、毋庸鰓慮也、</p>

<p>一竊自軍興以還、滬市人口激增、一般房主乘機加租、不一而足、推其　結之所在、蓋爲房主者、利用房屋之需求迫切、對承租人嚴訂期限、半年或一載不等、每屆期滿輙先向承租人通知遷讓、迫使加租、並從而種種需索、循環不已、予取予求、居民負担日增、房租糾紛迭起、按之法律、並無防止此項弊病之規定、坐令此種特殊之事態、</p>

<p>基督敎靑年會少年部、以我國本以禮義之邦聞名天下、而尤以孝忠爲人所欽佩、當此新舊道德衝突之時、少年對於孝親之道、每多疏忽輕視、違背親意、浪費金錢、脫離父母、逆倫等案層出不窮、爲重振舊道德、發揚數千年來固有之美德起見、曾於去年規定十月爲孝親月、（寓不忘懷胎十月之意）並規定是月之最末之星期日款待雙親、敬贈恩物（自己創作）、茲以本月廿六日爲最末星期日、故定是日集合會員、舉行第二屆雙親日、除備茶點招待會員雙親外、並有音樂表演、此外並在各敎會學校及各基督圑體作熱烈之宜傳、發揚孝思、以挽頽風、</p>

<h3>寗波四明銀行存款　在滬提取辦法</h3>

<h3>上海的盜竊　（上）</h3>
<p>— 百敏</p>
<p>上海竊盜之風素熾，年來尤見猖在，刦案竊案日必多起。匪徒的竊盜手段，雖不如美國匪徒的精巧，但藉兩租界的典當或收贓者銷贓的方法，却和美國匪徒相似。財物一旦被刦，大多無從尋覔，因爲市民對於被刦之物，很少能追道其詳的。但財物被刦，經警務處刑事科用巧妙方法，偵查尋獲的也有三分之一。假使市民對於較易被刦的財物，一一錄下其形式等特點，那末如果被刦，警務處偵查起來，更易着手，而查獲原贓，必更迅速。</p>
<p>以錶爲例，市民知道自己所備錶的牌名者必很多，可是記得錶上所鐫號碼的能有幾人？所以扒手在人羣中竊得錶等貴重物品，設法脫手後，原主往往無法追尋。每逢刦案發生，警方立即繕具被刦財物的名目和價值單。刦戶往往　報被刦財物的價值，致使偵查是案的警員，平添許多困難，甚至偵查時誤人歧途，因而延緩贓物的尋獲。</p>
<p>醫務處刑事科每天必有一份通吿，發給公共租界各典當，通吿用中英文印成，內載失竊和被刦物品名稱，假使典當接得通吿所開贓物，必須報吿警務處。偵查刦案的探員，循例到各典常調查，如果發現贓物，便有向典當主起訴的可能。</p>
<p>本市的匪徒除藉典常外，都托收贓者銷贓。收贓者常在自以爲警方眼綫所不知的地點，和匪徒會晤，一面交贓，一面交錢，於是原主很難尋獲失物，尤以珍寶為然。貴重物品中以戒指最難探　綫案，收贓者購下戒指，常將寳石拆下，轉售給珠寳商者，改磨式樣，携至外埠脫售；戒指如係金質或銀質，便溶化成塊出賣。</p>

<h3>迅速制止日用品飛漲！</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>日來日用品的飛漲，眞已到了「熱昏」的程度；市民們焦頭爛額，莫可名狀，長此以往，其何以堪！投機者造謠生事，掀風作浪，混水撈魚，至此巳極！不要說五金建築材料，呢絨，藥品，化學工業原料，由他手裏處置，就是最起碼的生活日用必需品，也是步步陷阱，無孔不入。上海市機製切麵業等同業公會，曾於日前建議工部局，將現存各堆棧麵粉，評定標準售價，囑令出籠公賣，這正是迫切的要求；茲悉平準會對工部局辦理麵粉，請匯亦將予以邀准。</p>
<p>米麵一日不可缺如，但在目前，陽春麵一小碗，由二角半，而三角，而三角半，而四角半；米呢，攙雜劣米不算，還取銷倉米掛牌，而且黑市盛行，市民們眞難以爲繼。幸而後者也由當局正式布吿闢謠，洋米最高零售價仍爲每石一百十七元；並嚴厲禁止非法出售。</p>
<p>其他日用品呢？肥皂每塊由五角而六角；火油每斤七角八角而九角；……火柴每匣兩角而至兩角半！總之無物不漲，有囤皆賺。大家要求管理各種日用品物價，當局亦曾有所表示。</p>
<p>我們以爲到最後關頭，斷然實行公賣，讓當局來劃出專門一部勉任各種物品之進口事務，從事於市民消費合作，亦是可能而必要。故以爲重要物品逃避運滬，而致此地缺貨者，則調整合作甚至取而代之，正可糾正上項顧慮；何况囤戶們在標準價格下還有大利可圖。現在或以後的倉中也正不嫌缺少堆積如山的貨物。</p>
<p>當局過去評定米煤限價，成效尙著，此番應客觀迫切要求，來管理物價及公賣，不患沒有成就；但望進行「謹愼」而更「迅速」「正確」，則庶幾於社會秩序，更能多方顧到。要不該囤戶叫　　突，多方作亂，唯有斷然處置；此固能使大衆離水火而登袵席，於囤戶本身亦未嘗非醍湖灌頂之一法，省得將來難免有人將倉中山積的存貨，作某種不付酬應用。</p>
<p>本地風光</p>
<h3>買米記</h3>
<p>— 左蕙</p>
<p>因爲我以前會一度短時間的在米店裏混過，所以對於米我是相當的熟識。因此，一幢屋子裏買米的事，都作成我去做了。</p>
<p>在米店的櫃檯前站定，端起一把米來，一邊隨便的問：「喂，現在頭號的大米哈格價錢？」</p>
<p>『一百六十二。』</p>
<p>『哦，你倒拿一把讓我看看－價錢相當便宜米。』說話之間我隨時流露着內行人的口氣。</p>
<p>夥計相當的慇懃，可是當我撥弄一下放在夥計掌上的被稱爲頭號的大米，我就現出一付勿樂意的樣子，雖然那種米店的玩意兒是我意料中的事。我問：『道是頭號的大米嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的。』</p>
<p>『可是你別瞎說罷，這明明是閩米，還說頭號呢！』閩米顆粒甚長大，色白，混在大米裏眞不是門外漢所能知道的，有的或者還說這種和着閩米的大米好呢；可是米店倌要來瞞過我，那眞是失着了。我說：「朋友，假使我高興買閩米，我會向你要閩米的，現在我向你要大米呀！」</p>
<p>米店倌有些不好意思，連忙改口說：『大米的還有。』</p>
<p>『什麽價錢？』</p>
<p>『一百七十二。』</p>
<p>『你剛才不是說頭號的大米一百六十二元嗎，現在怎麽啦？』</p>
<p>『……』夥計不能回答。</p>
<p>『價錢太貴了，我不要。』</p>
<p>夥計簡直對我有些討厭。可是爲了想占他一些便宜，於是我又和他演價：『那末現在的工部局米什麽價錢呀？』</p>
<p>『和別的人家一樣賣一百十七元。』</p>
<p>『好的，那末我就買一石。』我說：『不過最好請你給我一把樣子看。』</p>
<p>夥計交給我一把工部局米我想；他大的已知道我是一個內行了罷，可是不，夥計還想對我有一次欺瞞。看了那米樣子後，我慍然作色道：『這是工部局米嗎？那，那——你們沒有騙人罷。』</p>
<p>米店夥計胆怯的：『怎麼我們可以騙主顧呢？』</p>
<p>話很好聽，可是我疑心他正在騙我呵！</p>
<p>『先生，你要買我們替你揀一石特別好的就是了。』</p>
<p>聽了這句話，我又硬起來了，我說：『我倒不要你們揀一右特別好的。我向你們買工部局米，我只要你們給我工部局米就是了。』</p>
<p>我走的時候夥計深深的看了我一眼。我吿訴他們地址，不一回，米送來了。</p>
<h3>投信要仔細</h3>
<p>— 劉捷</p>
<p>昨天我經過靜安寺路，看見孤立在人行道上的綠色郵筒，就順便投了一封信，當我投時，有一個人正在那裏投，他投了就跑，不知道他底信已經漏了出來，我便把牠拾起，和我底一併投下去，不料又回了出來，眞奇怪，仔細一看，原來有一封很大的信，向外微微傾斜地欄置在縫口，後來經我觸了好幾下，才跌了下去，聽聲音不至一封，大的有三四封，我想誰如此粗心，要知道信筒雖大，而進口很狹，並且上下唇都非常厚。</p>
<p>據說從前美國一度常常發現信件上缺郵票，一天有一個巡警，見好幾個童子探手在郵筒裏面摸，便把他們捉住，審查的結果，他們偷過擱起在郵筒中的信，已不知多少了，有此「前車之鑒」，我們不得不要仔細。</p>
<p>我寄信時，往往見到郵筒口總有一二封信，擱在那裏的，要是碰到了卑鄙的人，就偷了去，照樣把郵票撕下來，再把信撕毀，這豈不是對你是損失嗎？</p>
<p>擱置在筒口，對他個人固然有損失而對他人亦頗有關係，就像昨天的那封信吧，這和人行道上四五個人並肩而行一樣的不道德，並且有過之無不及。</p>
<h3>預告</h3>
<p>— 二月</p>
<p>——請問先生，這裏附近你看見巡捕嗎？</p>
<p>——沒有，我連一個影子都沒有看見。</p>
<p>——很好，那末請你把大衣和錢袋一起都交給我。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>「爸爸我瞧報紙上有招請女職員的，回頭我去試試看行不行？」梅寳把才借來的一張申報攤放在膝蓋上，透着很興奮的神氣說。</p>
<p>秋海棠最初還是竭力反對，因爲他把上海這個地方看得太可怕了，簡直不願讓他女兒獨自走出去跟上海的空氣接觸。後來梅寳很堅決地說：</p>
<p>「與其坐在家裏死守，還不是出去冒險試一試，也不見得上海人個個都是壞蛋！」</p>
<p>最後，秋海棠便接受了梅寳的建議，一起整整衣服，趕到那一家登報的公司去。這一家公司倒是很正式的，然而來應徵的人却太多了；而且他們所規定的最起碼的資格是初中畢業生，這一點梅寳就不及格。雖然主考的人允許通融，但上海這地方是把英文當「國語」的，商業機關尤其注意，梅寳從小在北方受敎育，英文程度很有限，幾句會話先對付不了，何况其他？（二四四）</p>

<p>前兩天看上海銀行崑劇彩排，使我忽然感覺到仙霓社爲什麼不訓練幾個女伶？因爲紹興戲，滬劇，話劇，說書，無一不有曼妙婀娜的好女子，而且還要掛頭牌，上海人看戲，先要注重女角，尤其耍扮相美麗，舉動靈活，行頭漂亮，眼鋒傳情，一輩子老老小小，大太太姨太太，都要來賞光賞光。</p>
<p>崑腔戲有幾齣正氣彌天的劇本，是伍員寄子，蘇武望鄉，建文慘覩，貞娥刺虎，看了不會頹志，假使女伶上臺唱佳期，思凡，正配看客胃口，臺下吃香的人一定很多。</p>
<p>有人對我說，唱崑曲要衷氣好，又要名手吹笛，女人嗓子總是鬆細，只有旦角可以勉强，倘然唱正生勿會成功。但是男女合演，無所關係，琴挑的陳妙常，亭會的謝素秋，恰襯身分，倘要講唱女老生，平劇話劇中，也是鳳毛麟角，就是唱小生還恐不相宜，因爲女人屁股大，台步不方便，只有紹興戲裏串串無妨的。</p>
<p>蘇州女子的原來蘇白，軟糯得很，說出來天然本事，鄭傳鑑，張傳芳是這邊人，大可以請他親戚朋友中選兩個絕色佳人來，學弄學弄，上了臺崑劇一定可以復興，就要掛出客滿的脾子來了。</p>

<p>聯邦公司係由團聯·金星·國華·民華·等數公司合力組織者，專營竇邦電影膠片，今當竇邦膠片來源將中斷聲中，記者曾訪該公司負責人卞毓英君，據談：「聯邦尙有存貨二百餘萬元，大約可以維持各公司的需要到明年四月底，同時並已向美國總公司電購二百萬元，務使盡可能的以最迅捷的方法寄到。此批新貨，大概亦能維持半年光景。不過在此缺貨當口，寳邦膠片，除只供給國聯金星國華民華等有關各公司外，拒絕新戶購買，此事已由前日之董事會議決定的了。」</p>

<h3>Full Cooperation between the US, UK, Netherlands, and India: Negotiations Have Reached a Decision Stage; Australia and New Zealand Discuss the Pacific Situation; Dutch East Indies Navy to Conduct Four-Day Exercises Next Week</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 23rd (United Press) - Observers here believed yesterday that negotiations between the British, American governments, and the Dutch East Indies have reached a stage where, in the event of incidents, Pacific nations can establish full cooperation. It is reported that Australian Prime Minister Curtin is maintaining close contact with Washington through Australian Minister Casey. It is said that, apart from the existing close understanding, no definitive joint defense plan has been established in the Pacific. However, negotiations have reached a decisive point to ensure that precautionary steps are taken so that goods can be transported to Australia to cope with the crisis. The Cabinet announced the latest developments last night. Curtin also informed the ministers about the negotiations over the past two weeks. Curtin declined to disclose the details, considering them "not in the public interest." Officials pointed out that Australia would not conclude special agreements with the United States or the Dutch East Indies without discussing them with the United Kingdom. However, the basis of the current steps is to ensure that defense issues are fully discussed.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 23rd (Reuters) - According to an announcement by Australian Prime Minister Curtin after the meeting, the Australian War Advisory Council today discussed in detail the general relationship between Australia and New Zealand regarding the Pacific situation. The supply of goods to the two autonomous territories and Australia's role in the Eastern supply group were also debated.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 23rd (Reuters) - After consulting with the Australian War Cabinet and military leaders, and further reviewing Australia's northern defenses, a meeting was held yesterday. The resolutions will be discussed by the War Trial Council today, and New Zealand Prime Minister Nash will also attend. After the cabinet meeting, Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated that the government would be satisfied only when all unemployed workers are employed and labor is utilized in the best way. The Australian government's plan is to control investment and organize manpower so that available manpower can be mobilized to meet war needs, and to absorb excess income and encourage people to donate voluntarily to carry out the war. Since the beginning of the war, 450,000 people have been incorporated into the military. The total amount of military pay for this year is 150 million pounds more than the pre-war level.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (United Press) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Dutch East Indies had notified Japan that from October 28th to 31st, all ships would be prohibited from entering the two-mile-wide waterway of Javanese territorial waters facing Batavia due to Dutch naval exercises.</p>
<p>Batavia, 23rd (United Press) - According to investigations today, the Dutch in the East Indies are very indifferent to the establishment of the Tojo cabinet in Japan. Unofficial comments from officials have revealed the seriousness of the situation, but there is no fear for the immediate future. Dutch East Indies leaders do not openly express official opinions on Japan's recent cabinet changes. Dutch newspapers also followed this general intention, warning the Javanese people that there is a possibility of any accident, but did not reflect any particular anxiety. A few days ago, the Dutch may have had different views on Japan's development, but now the residents of the Dutch East Indies have full confidence. They have seen their army develop into a powerful mechanized army, backed by countless American-shipped fighter planes. British, American, and Australian staff officers continue to come to the Dutch East Indies. They often talk about joint offensives, and the US, UK, China, and Netherlands front has repeatedly resolved. The slogan "maintain the status quo but do not offend Japan" seems to have been forgotten, and replaced by serious silence. Well-informed sources say that the only remaining difficulty in the Dutch East Indies defenses is the lack of a truly signed joint defense agreement between democratic countries. A prominent Dutchman told reporters, "If the UK and the US are willing to promise in writing to assist us if we are attacked, the last obstacle to a firm stance against Japan's southward advance can be removed."</p>
<h3>Japan Builds Military Bases on the Vietnamese Border</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 23rd (Reuters) - Two Thai newspapers with different political leanings today both carried news of the movement of Japanese troops in Vietnam near the Thai border. Sri Krung Daily reported that Japanese soldiers were dispatched in areas not far from Saigon, Prun, Bon, and other places near the Thai border. A large Japanese army will build a military base in the Prun Bon area. Subabhans Daily reported that Japanese troops have been transferred from Hanoi and southern Vietnam to the Vietnamese side of the Mekong River border. The main highway from Pakse to Saigon is now used by the Japanese army and is only used for military traffic.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Reuters) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, will depart for his post on October 28th. After attending farewell parties in Kobe and Osaka, Yoshizawa will depart on the Osaka Shosen Kaisha ship on the 31st. Eleven other officials have been appointed to assist Yoshizawa.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Reuters) - A Yomiuri Shimbun correspondent in Bangkok today again accused the UK and the US of conspiracies in Thailand and Southeast Asia, saying that the US, UK, China, and the Netherlands are now trying various methods to prevent Thailand from cooperating with Japan. The British government is also negotiating with the Dutch authorities to place the Dutch East Indies under the direct jurisdiction of Singapore. It is reported that Duff Cooper will soon return to England to report everything to the British government.</p>
<p>Manila, 23rd (United Press) - Major Leechmon, the British liaison officer of the Governor of Burma, arrived here yesterday en route to Hong Kong on an official mission. Major Snowchmon denied the rumors in the newspapers that Burma is pro-Japanese. He said that it is indeed true that there is a strong national sentiment in Burma, but the sane Burmese people do not want self-government at this time because they have seen what has happened in French Vietnam and must realize what Thailand and Burma will encounter once the United Kingdom no longer protects them.</p>
<h3>Although the Tojo Cabinet is Formed, Japan's Attitude Remains Cautious, Hoping to End the War with China Early</h3>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Reuters) - News from Tokyo recently clearly indicates that although the new cabinet has been formed, Japan is still Japan. The Tojo cabinet has been in office for several days, and Japan remains cautious but is prepared to take advantage of any opportunity that arises. Although the Japanese regime is in the hands of the army, there are no truly extreme elements in the cabinet, nor have any special figures inclined towards the Axis powers been recruited. Although a more radical policy is possible, no steps have yet been taken in this direction. The best indication of Japan's true situation seems to be Germany's disappointment that Japan's development has not been beneficial to Berlin's plans. The well-informed Weekly Foreign Communications stated that Tojo did not bring many famous pro-Axis Japanese into the cabinet and continued US-Japan talks, which Germany felt quite apprehensive about.</p>
<p>Waging a Psychological War on the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Washington sources believe that Japan's only concern is to improve its position in the European war. As for whether this goal is achieved by uniting with the Axis countries or the democratic countries, it is not a decisive consideration. There is reason to believe that Japan's policy is to exert limited pressure on the democratic countries to see what the reaction is. Japan will greatly strengthen its position in Vietnam while watching the reaction of the UK and the US. Japan may also take action against Thailand to disturb the UK to find out the extent to which the UK will aid Thailand in resisting Japan. At the same time, Japan will wage a psychological war on the Soviet Union to spread news of the concentration of Japanese troops in Manchuria, while Japanese newspapers will publicize that Japan has traditional rights in Siberia. The Foreign Communications also stated that the Tojo government is now contacting Chongqing with the intention of negotiating peace, because China is apprehensive about the US-Japan talks, so Japan takes the opportunity to do so. However, people here feel that Japan now wants to end the war in China at any cost, but will soon continue to fight China to make up for its peace movement. This is what the Foreign Communications said. It should be known that all those familiar with Far Eastern events feel that China does not need to be apprehensive if it has this anxiety, because they believe that the US-Japan talks are an effort to freeze the existing relationship, not an effort to establish a compromise. The continuation of the talks is nothing more than a delaying tactic before the final break.</p>
<p>The US Decides to Continue Aiding China in the War</p>
<p>We must know that the strength of the United States allows it to have a navy, which is now being strengthened day by day. Furthermore, after the US-Japan talks, the talks will be conducted by Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State, and Sugawara, the Japanese Counselor, while Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador Nomura will personally negotiate only when there is something definite to discuss. This fact shows the preliminary or exploratory nature of the US-Japan talks. We still have to know that Japan, with its large army trapped in the Chinese quagmire, and with this war against China still consuming Japanese resources, cannot have sufficient strength to fight a first-class country. If the United States can obtain a guarantee that Japan will be exhausted in China, then aid to China will continue to increase. The more China fights Japan, the more aid China can get from the United States. There is definitely no tendency in Washington to sell out China. If the authorities have this policy, it will undoubtedly be opposed by the whole country. The German side is now enticing the Japanese, thinking that American merchant ships can be destroyed, American warships can be attacked, and the United States has never had a real uproar. Why should Tokyo worry about the United States, because the United States can never fight on two fronts, so it may not fight on any front. This statement by the German side is not accurate and will be proven or soon be revealed in the future, which is unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese and German Observations Differ Greatly</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Reuters) - The Washington telegram from Qin Wu Qi Bao stated that, according to reliable sources in Washington, since the establishment of the Tojo cabinet, Germans in Tokyo have repeatedly wanted the Japanese government to issue official statements reaffirming Japan's adherence to the Axis powers, but they have not succeeded so far. It has also been heard that since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the German side has often allowed Japanese observers to obtain all kinds of information and observations that the British and Americans cannot obtain. Tokyo's view of the outcome of the Soviet-German war is almost entirely different from what Berlin has publicized on key points and is similar to what Haliman reported to the US President on Sunday. Judging from the situation, Tojo and his cabinet members obviously want to handle things cautiously. It is heard that the Japanese Emperor even instructed them not to act rashly in matters related to US relations. According to speculation, Japan's greatest interest at present is to exert various pressures on China militarily and politically in the hope of ending the Chinese incident. Now there are even rumors that Tokyo and Chiang Kai-shek's entourage have indeed had some contact and are currently under study.</p>
<p>US Women's Groups Ask to Mediate the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (United Press) - The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom urged President Weisford and Secretary of State Hull yesterday to quickly mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The women's community said that the United States should cooperate in actively mediating Far Eastern issues, such as negotiating commercial agreements with Japan and canceling the Exclusion Act. A new policy should be adopted towards China, so that the British, American, and Japanese concessions should be returned to China, all foreign troops should be withdrawn from China, and all foreigners should give up all extraterritorial rights in China.</p>
<h3>Olay Urges Congress to Quickly Approve Merchant Ship Armament; Hull Criticizes German Terrorist Policy; All Crew Members of the Lehigh Ship Rescued</h3>
<p>Washington, 23rd (United Press) - White House spokesman Olay yesterday actually urged Congress to quickly abolish Articles 2 and 6 of the Neutrality Act (the provision prohibiting merchant ship armament), allowing American ships to sail anywhere on the seven oceans under the protection of their own cannons and flags. After the announcement on Tuesday that the ninth and tenth ships managed by the United States had been sunk, Olay issued a statement to the press. Olay read the main points of the President's message to Congress on October 9, requesting (1) the abolition of Article 6 as soon as possible to allow merchant ships to be armed, (2) Congress to give "early and earnest attention" to the abolition of Article 2, and open the ports of belligerent countries to American ships.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (United Press) - Secretary of State Hull criticized Germany yesterday, saying that the sinking of the American ship Lehigh in the South Atlantic was the best example of "the Nazi attempt to create terror, threats, and lawless policies on the high seas." He said that Germany's procedure aims to intimidate countries like the United States, preventing them from completing the necessary self-defense. He said that many people in the government are seeking to abolish the two provisions of the Neutrality Act to allow American merchant ships to enter the ports of belligerent countries, which is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (United Press) - Twenty-two missing crew members of the American freighter Lehigh have landed in Freetown, Africa. The Maritime Commission said that all crew members of the ship were reportedly rescued.</p>
<h3>The US Navy Assumes a Major Mission to Maintain Freedom of the Seas</h3>
<p>New York, 23rd (United Press) - Rear Admiral Andrews, who was appointed to serve on the new American destroyer "Bristol", warned yesterday, "The Navy Department has a major mission at the moment." It is noted that the "Bristol" is a sister ship to the "Cole," and the two ships are among the first twelve destroyers recently built. Rear Admiral Andrews said, "We must maintain freedom of the seas, remembering that the fate of a ship in war is tied to one person. In the shortest period of time, we will encounter this test."</p>
<h3>A Major War Will Soon Break Out in the Libyan Region</h3>
<p>German and Italian Troops Equipped for Desert Warfare Arrive in North Africa to Prepare to Deal with British Troops</p>
<p>German Border, 23rd (Reuters) - According to news from Milan, the general impression in Italy is that a major war will soon break out in Libya. The British army or the Axis army may take the initiative. German and Italian troops fully equipped for desert warfare have arrived in North Africa, except for those lost in the convoy. Italian General Bastico has completed his inspection of the Axis forces in Libya, and the storms in Apia have stopped. The weather is gradually favorable for military operations.</p>
<p>German and Italian Troop Transports Attacked by British Forces</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) - The Admiralty issued a public statement yesterday, reporting that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in the Mediterranean reported that the British Navy continued to attack the enemy's supply lines and was quite successful. A convoy of enemy ships protected by many warships was attacked by British submarines en route to Libya. Two supply ships were torpedoed, one of which sank. Another British submarine risked the fire of coastal defenses and opened fire on the Apollonia airfield in the Cyrenaica region, hitting hangars and other buildings.</p>
<h3>The President Madison Turns Back to Honolulu; US Maritime Association Announces Construction of 263 Ships</h3>
<p>Honolulu, 23rd (United Press) - The President Madison, ordered by the US Navy Department to report to the port of a "friendly country" nearby, returned to Honolulu yesterday morning. The ship left here on October 12 and is believed to have traveled 1,400 miles in four days of sailing east. However, it returned due to the order issued by the Navy Department last Saturday. It is believed that the ship will set sail again today. There are more than 100 Chinese passengers on board, who were forced to leave Panama for Shanghai before the recent coup there.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Havas) - The Maritime Commission announced that it will build 263 small ships to supplement the losses of British ships and develop American shipping. The plan to build 1,200 large ships is still proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Build an Airport in Macau</h3>
<p>New York, 23rd (United Press) - Last night, an Australian radio station broadcast a report from Shanghai saying that Japan is currently planning to build an airport in Macau. This move is similar to the nature of the new route from Japanese-controlled Isla Palma to Timor, which was opened under the recent Japan-Portugal agreement. The construction of this base will give Japan an advantage over Hong Kong's air routes by occupying the sea and air, and will control the sea and air routes from Manila and Singapore to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>International Conference of Anti-Aggression Representatives</h3>
<p>London, 22nd - Representatives of the invaded countries have recently established the International Conference in London. The purpose is to discuss issues related to each country by freely exchanging opinions. The conference does not make resolutions and is an independent group not controlled by the government. Sir Cecil is the chairman. Several Chinese expatriates have now joined the conference and elected Guo Bingwen as their representative. Participants include China, the US, the UK, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Free France, Greece, the Netherlands East Indies, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, and South Ralaf and other countries.</p>
<h3>Icelandic Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Icelandic Capital, 23rd (United Press) - The Icelandic coalition cabinet resigned yesterday due to disagreements on maintaining living standards, increasing salaries, and other issues related to the influx of British and American troops.</p>
<h3>US Route for Supplying the Soviet Union Will Take the Route to Akancha, the Vladivostok Route Will Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>Washington, 23rd (United Press) - The US Maritime Commission announced yesterday that after October 28, the commission will abandon the Vladivostok route for supplying the Soviet Union. The Commission stated, "From now on, transportation will take the route to Akancha because the quantity of supplies needed by the Soviet Union is constantly increasing. From now on, American supplies will be shipped from Boston, so that various ports can be used to avoid congestion. Officials denied that this change was a concession to Japan. Well-informed circles said that they believed that the United States adopted Akancha for several reasons. They said that the oil storage in Vladivostok has reached saturation, and the Soviet Union is now feeling that the long Siberian Railway is insufficient. The port of Vladivostok is also freezing. The route from Boston to Akancha is more direct and can obtain the advantage of quick delivery. The reason why this route was not adopted before was because of the winter freezing, but the Soviets now say that there is a way to keep the port open all year round. Another reason for this change is related to the Congressional debate on amending the Neutrality Act, because unless the registration is changed to another country, the US round cannot sail to Vladivostok."</p>

<h3>Belgian Ambassador Ji Youmu Flies from Hong Kong to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Belgian Ambassador Ji Youmu and his wife flew back to Chongqing from Hong Kong on a China Airlines flight at 8:30 am on the 23rd. Vice President Kong's representative Chen Yaodong, External Affairs representative Ling Qihan, and Belgian Embassy Secretary Smith and others went to the airport to welcome them. After getting off the plane, the Belgian Ambassador went straight back to the embassy to rest. According to the ambassador, on the way from Ping to Shanghai and then to Hong Kong to Chongqing, he was delighted to hear the good news of the great victories in northern Hunan and western Hubei and was extremely excited.

A tea party will be held within days to celebrate. (Telegram of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Changes May Be Made to Personnel of the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Issue of Establishing a Ministry of Trade Has Not Yet Been Resolved; Chen Yi Will Soon Take Office as Director-General of Military Supplies</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to news from private sources, there may be slight changes in the personnel of the Chinese government soon. The issue of establishing a Ministry of Trade has not yet been resolved. Although the government has decided in principle to establish this ministry, it is heard that a suitable person has not yet been found for the position of minister. Chen Guangfu has been repeatedly asked to take this position, but Chen has always declined. When Li Guochin, the manager of the Hua Chang Trading Company in New York, recently arrived in Chongqing, there were rumors that Li would be the Minister of Trade, but Li flew to New York after staying in Chongqing for half a month, so the rumors quickly subsided. The Road reporter heard that the government did not ask Li to take this position, because the government and Li never mentioned this matter in their correspondence. Until a suitable person is found, the establishment of the Ministry of Trade may be postponed indefinitely. The road management rights under the Ministry of Communications have been transferred to the Transportation Control Bureau under the Military Affairs Commission, so Yu Feipeng recently went to Kunming to take over various offices and factories. Another important change is that Chen Yi, the former chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has been appointed as the Director-General of Military Supplies to succeed Yu. It is heard that although Chen has not yet agreed to take office, everyone generally expects that he will eventually take this position soon. (Reuters telegram of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Guangwu Were Finally Repelled by Chinese Forces After Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Japanese troops dividing into groups to invade south of Cenhekou were all blocked and attacked. Fierce fighting is still ongoing near Yuyangzhen.</p>
<p>Chongqing Military News: (1) On the day the Chinese fought the Japanese in the Tanggang area of Guangwu Township, a unit of over a thousand Japanese soldiers sneaked to Mengzhai at 4 PM on the 21st and continued to invade Gaocun. After the Chinese army bravely blocked and attacked them, a fierce battle ensued until the evening, finally repelling the Japanese, causing them heavy casualties. Currently, Chinese and Japanese forces are still engaged in combat in the Tanggang area. (2) A unit of over a thousand Japanese soldiers who had been harassing Guangwu, infiltrated through Hezhai and Niangniangzhai to the west of Suzhai (northeast of Rongyang) before dawn on the 22nd. They were promptly intercepted by the Chinese army. The battle lasted until 2 PM. Many Japanese were killed or wounded, and the remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue them, and fierce fighting is currently taking place in the southwestern suburbs of Guangwu. (3) After the Japanese forces that invaded Suzhai from Guangwu were repelled by the Chinese army, the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to attack the Japanese. By the morning of the 23rd, they had also defeated the Japanese forces who had infiltrated and occupied Hezhai, Niangniangzhai, Houwang and other places south of Guangwu, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Japanese fled eastward. (4) The number of Japanese troops who had been infiltrating south from Shashi via Cenhekou to places such as Zifusi increased again on the 21st and continued to divide into groups to infiltrate south.

<h3>"Go to the Northwest!" Zhu Jiahua's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Minister Zhu Jiahua broadcasted on the Central Broadcasting Station on September 25th, with the topic "Go to the Northwest." The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Listeners, I have just returned from a long trip to the northwestern provinces, and the situation in the Northwest is worth introducing to you. If we don't go to the Northwest, we won't know its greatness, and we won't see the greatness of China. Some people who have never been to the Northwest often have two incorrect views: first, they think the Northwest is our borderland; second, they think the Northwest is a barren place. This is completely wrong. From the perspective of China's overall terrain, the Northwest is our hinterland, and Lanzhou is the center of the country, so Premier Sun Yat-sen once had the idea of ​​establishing the capital in Lanzhou. Our country is full of beautiful rivers and mountains, and the Northwest is not only no exception, but our country cannot do without it. We must know that the Northwest is a place where culture gathers, with fertile fields and rich resources. When we talk about the history of Chinese national development, the Northwest is the most valuable. Originally, the Northwest was the birthplace of Chinese culture. Dynasties, especially the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties, established their meritorious achievements and systems in this area. Therefore, we can see ancient sites everywhere in the Northwest. In the Hexi area of Gansu, we can see the spirit of our ancestors in pioneering and developing the land, and various remains, such as the ancient Great Wall, the Thousand Buddha Caves, and various rare treasures, such as wooden slips, Buddhist scriptures, hand scrolls, and murals. Therefore, Dunhuang is a world-famous archaeological site, and is the object of research for archaeologists from various countries year after year. The climate in the Northwest is most suitable for human health. Even if a person works all day long, he will not feel tired because of the comfortable climate. I think a sick person will surely recover his health quickly after going to the Northwest. Looking at the strong and healthy bodies of the Northwestern compatriots, their ability to endure hardship and hard work truly makes our Southern compatriots inferior. The Northwest contains endless treasures. There are many undeveloped minerals, and the production on the ground can be said to be all-encompassing. In addition, with the irrigation of the Yellow River and various canals, the land becomes more fertile, planting is lush, and the harvest is abundant. All crops are suitable for the soil and climate, so it can be said that you reap what you sow, and everything grows! We can see tree planting and afforestation is beginning there, with several large-scale projects. We can also see herds of thousands of cattle and sheep and convoys of camels, which are not easily seen elsewhere. As for the local handicrafts, such as wool spinning and weaving, are unique to the Northwest. Recently, various machine industries have been held everywhere and are constantly increasing. Operating various businesses in the Northwest has a good environment and many opportunities. If you are engaged in scientific work, there are virgin lands everywhere where you can create and discover new things. If you go to engage in education, there is a great shortage of teachers there, and you will be welcomed everywhere. If you start a newspaper or magazine, everyone is clamoring for "literary people" to go. If you engage in farming or reclamation, there is a lot of wasteland and the land price is very cheap. If you open a factory, there is very little competition and wages are especially low. If you engage in business, all kinds of businesses are easy to do, transportation is accessible in all directions, and there are also international routes... In short, you don't have to worry about not having anything to do when you go to the Northwest, and things will definitely go smoothly. Everyone: The Northwest is vast and rich in resources, but the population density is not enough. What the Northwest urgently needs is manpower. If the land in the Northwest is fully utilized, the resources are fully utilized, and the goods are freely circulated, a large increase in manpower is necessary. If we want to develop the Northwest, we must implement the plan to go to the Northwest. This will not only fulfill the responsibilities of citizens, but also solve personal career and personal life problems. There are many opportunities for various careers there, and the cost of living is relatively low, making it easy to establish a career. The above are all my feelings after personally going to the Northwest to conduct research this time. I hope that compatriots will rise up and quickly go to the Northwest to work!</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Kang Development Company to be Formally Established Next Month</h3>
<p>Capital of 70 million yuan, the Central Government will Provide 30 million yuan, Zhang Qun and Deng Hanxiang will Serve as Chairman and General Manager Respectively</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Sichuan-Kang Development Company, which is being prepared by the Sichuan-Kang Construction Committee, will be formally established at the beginning of next month. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, is scheduled to come to Chongqing at the end of the month to participate. Zhang will soon hold the position of chairman of the company, while Deng Hanxiang will be the general manager. The company's capital is 70 million yuan, with the Central Government contributing 30 million yuan, Sichuan Province contributing 3 million yuan, Kang Province contributing 3 million yuan, and the remaining 30 million yuan being raised through commercial shares. Half of the amount has already been fully subscribed in Chongqing. The amount raised in the other provinces has not yet been fully reported, but those in charge estimate that the mere 15 million yuan will definitely not be a problem. The purpose of the company is not only to increase production in the rear to meet the needs of the war of resistance, but also to become the industrial center of western China after the end of the war, so as to avoid the disadvantages of concentrating factories along the coast.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Safety Issue of the Aid to Soviet Route</h3>
<p>With the intensification of the Soviet-German war, how to step up aid to the Soviet Union has become an extremely urgent issue. Britain, which has an alliance relationship with the Soviet Union, believes that it is not yet possible to establish a second battlefield on land at this time, and can only dispatch its air force to destroy the German rear and use its navy to ensure control of the ocean. Therefore, the main task of directly aiding the Soviet Union naturally relies on the United States. Mr. Harriman, the leader of the American delegation to the Soviet Union, has recently returned to the United States and met with President Roosevelt, expressing deep trust in the Soviet Union's combat power, but also frankly stating that the Soviet Union urgently needs replenishment of war equipment and material assistance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington the day before yesterday, the American president fully agreed with Mr. Harriman's report and has ordered the acceleration and expansion of aid to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States' active aid to the Soviet Union is not a problem in essence. The only problem that remains at present is the transportation of these aid goods, especially the safety of the transportation routes.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's foreign transportation has always relied on four gateways, namely Arkhangelsk in the north, Leningrad in the west, Odessa in the south, and Vladivostok in the east. At present, whether Leningrad and Odessa are still in Soviet hands, they are simply impossible to use due to the blockade of sea routes, and Arkhangelsk is located in a remote area with a longer ice period (170 days per year), and its foreign routes must pass the north coast of Norway, which is currently occupied by German troops, making sailing very dangerous. Therefore, the importance of Vladivostok to the Soviet Union, and thus the importance of the Siberian region to the Soviet Union, has now greatly increased. There is the Siberian Railway connecting Vladivostok and the European Russian headquarters, but the eastern section of this railway is built along the border of Heilongjiang Province, making it vulnerable to Japanese sabotage. Therefore, in recent years, the Soviet Union has built another Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM), starting from Taishet in the Lake Baikal region, connecting to the Siberian Railway, passing through Komsomolsk to Sovetskaya Gavan (north of Vladivostok). Vladivostok and Sovetskaya Gavan have also frequently developed transportation to Nikolayevsk and the Kamchatka Peninsula further north. Therefore, the Soviet Union's external gateway in the Far East is now fully capable of absorbing aid supplies.</p>
<p>However, Axis Germany has long engaged in collusion and deployments in the Far East. The Soviet Union's Vladivostok or Sovetskaya Gavan, and even the entire Primorsky Krai, is actually completely surrounded. The Soviet Union's Far East garrison is certainly considered to have the strength for self-defense, but it cannot be denied that the Soviet Union's transportation infrastructure in this region is encountering serious external threats. Yesterday, a Washington telegram stated that the US Shipping Board has announced the temporary abandonment of the Vladivostok route for supplying the Soviet Union and has switched to Arkhangelsk. Since the US official has not recognized this change as a concession to Japan, its substantial meaning cannot be interpreted as having felt an external threat. Because based on the transport capacity of the Siberian Railway, it is not easy to believe that the oil storage capacity of Vladivostok has reached saturation; moreover, the facilities and environment of Arkhangelsk are not ideal. Now that the Soviet Union urgently needs to absorb a large amount of American aid, it must go all out to clear the transportation between the United States and the Soviet Union and ensure its safety.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being strongly threatened by the Axis powers, the Soviet Union has two other routes for transportation with the United States besides taking the route through Arkhangelsk: one is through the Bering Strait and the Soviet Union's far north region, and the other is through the Indian Ocean and the Iranian Plateau. (1) Regarding the former, the Bering Strait is only about 50 miles wide, making it easy to pass through, and transportation in the Soviet Union's far north region has also been actively developed in recent years, with a "Great Northern Sea Route Administration" (Glawsevmorputj) established, with Mr. Babanin serving as its director since 1939. He not only manages the transportation affairs of the region, but also holds scientific and military power. At present, large-scale naval and land military bases have been built in Polyarny (near Murmansk), Providence Bay (opposite Alaska), and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (on the Kamchatka Peninsula) in the far north of the Soviet Union, with Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky especially aimed at Japan; and powerful air force bases have also been established in Dikson Island, Obdorsk, Novy Port, Uelen, and Bolsheretsk (on the Kamchatka Peninsula). While establishing many naval supply stations in the Arctic region, the Soviet Union has also stepped up the development of land transportation and deployed an aviation network known as the "Stalin Aviation Line." After some adjustments, the transportation between the Soviet Union and Alaska in the United States will be directly and closely linked. (2) Regarding the latter, there are two other routes: one passes through India and Afghanistan to Central Asia, and the other passes through Iran. Iran's highways are relatively developed, and the longitudinal railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea was completed the year before last, connecting to the Soviet Caucasus region. As the weather turns cold this winter, the center of gravity of the German-Soviet war will definitely shift south, at which time the Iranian transportation line will become even more important. Therefore, the recent joint Soviet-British invasion of Iran to drive out the Nazi fifth column and control its transportation has great strategic significance.</p>
<p>However, these two new aid to the Soviet routes—either through the Bering Strait and the far north region, or through the Indian Ocean and the Iranian Plateau—are probably still not comparable in quantity and efficiency to those taking the route through Vladivostok and the Siberian Railway. And even these two new routes cannot be said to be completely immune to the plundering of the Far East Axis countries. Therefore, even though the United States can have several parallel routes to aid the Soviet Union at this time, the safety of these routes must still be given the most fundamental consideration, and the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain must jointly seek to eliminate the destructive forces of the Axis powers in the Far East. This should be an important key to the entire development of the Far East situation in the near future.</p>
<h3>Soviet Chief of Staff Appointed Commander of Central Front</h3>
<p>Soviet Counteroffensive Around Moscow Gains Momentum, Signs of Exhaustion Appear in German Marching Offensive</p>
<p>Reuter, Kuybyshev (Samara), 23rd - General Zhukov, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, has been appointed commander of the central front, replacing Marshal Timoshenko amidst fierce fighting in Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. Simultaneously, while announcing Zhukov's replacement of Timoshenko, the Pravda stated that despite suffering extremely heavy losses, the German army continues to dispatch troops to reinforce the brutal fighting around Moscow. The sector commanded by Zhukov, including the front 120 kilometers west of Moscow, has become the most critical area of the entire war. Assisting Zhukov is Lieutenant General Artonanov, commander of the Moscow garrison. (According to our correspondent, the Samara dispatch did not reveal whether Timoshenko was reassigned, recalled, or dismissed.) Today marks the 22nd day of the German offensive on Moscow, yet life in the Soviet interior remains normal, as if unaware of the war. The government has intensified work and increased motorization. The government and Zhukov are currently preparing Moscow to resist German attacks and organizing vast and structured resources to defend Moscow's rear. The nature and strength of the Soviet forces and equipment in reserve remain unknown, but the government's preparations lead people to believe they must be very substantial. The Soviet government, relocated east of Moscow, continues to conduct official business as usual, and the populace remains calm and orderly, showing no signs of discouragement.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - According to recent reports received here, there are various signs that the German offensive on Moscow has, at least temporarily, reached a point of exhaustion. The Soviets have inflicted heavy damage on the German air force, with many German aircraft crashing and being damaged while landing on waterlogged airfields, preventing them from taking off to evade Soviet attacks. The Moscow Gazette stated that as of last Sunday, no fewer than 500 German aircraft had been destroyed on land in the central sector. The entire Moscow battlefield is now covered in snow, with biting winds that cut like knives. Roads are knee-deep in mud.</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 23rd - The Soviet midnight communiqué stated that after days of intense fighting, the Soviet army withdrew from Taganrog on the Sea of Azov (approximately 50 miles west of Rostov) after killing and wounding 35,000 German soldiers. Yesterday, Soviet forces engaged the enemy along the entire front, destroying 34 enemy aircraft on Tuesday, while losing eight Soviet aircraft. Seventeen German aircraft were shot down near Moscow on Tuesday and fourteen yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - Soviet forces are currently launching fierce counterattacks around Moscow. There have been no significant changes in the overall situation. The German forces from Leningrad south to the Ilmen front are now adopting a defensive posture. In the south, after the Soviet withdrawal from Taganrog, the situation in its vicinity is reportedly severe. It is said that in this area and elsewhere, the Germans have a large advantage in the number of tanks. Soviet authorities have ordered Soviet soldiers to destroy enemy tanks at all costs and have urged Soviet workers to redouble their efforts to produce tanks. Recent reports from the front indicate that the Soviet army is taking advantage of the adverse weather conditions to hinder the German advance. The Soviet side claims that the German advance towards the Donets River basin has slowed, and the German advance on Rostov has been temporarily halted. In the Orel region, halfway between Ukraine and Moscow, German forces have not exerted further pressure since the successful Soviet counterattack. It is reported that the Germans are now using small units, each with three to five tanks and twenty motorized vehicles, to seek out weak points in the Soviet lines. Positions west of Moscow are repeatedly lost and regained. In the northwest, near Kalinin, in the area where the Leningrad railway crosses the upper Volga River, the Germans attempted to launch another offensive but were met with fierce Soviet resistance. Reports from Moscow indicate that enemy troops who crossed the river have been annihilated.</p>
<p>Around the City of Moscow, Millions of Workers Dig Trenches</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - As Moscow faces a critical situation, countless socialists, non-party members, workers, employees, and cultural figures are going to the socialist party committees, city military committees, and the Krasnaya Presnya district every day, requesting to be sent to the front to defend Moscow. An army composed entirely of volunteers has been formed in two days. This army is stationed at a certain gate in Moscow and is currently undergoing intensive training. Fortifications are being built rapidly, and millions of laborers are helping to dig trenches and set up anti-tank guns and machine guns. Under the command of Dr. Arseniev, a worker from a legal institution, defensive positions were built non-stop yesterday. Their enthusiasm for work is unprecedented. "Work for the front, work for victory" has become their slogan. Factories produced massive amounts of military equipment in a single day yesterday. In addition to the armies organized by workers, factories have also formed factory guard teams. This is the daily life of the people of the Krasnaya Presnya district. They have an unwavering determination to do everything in their power to defend Moscow and turn the gates of Moscow into a graveyard for Hitler's followers.</p>
<p>In the Rostov Area, the Germans are Forced to Adopt a Defensive Posture</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - According to recent reports from the southern front, in certain areas around Rostov-on-Don, Soviet forces have halted the enemy advance. The Germans, unable to resist or counterattack, have been forced to adopt a defensive posture. Fighting in the Taganrog area continues to be intense. Regarding Moscow, the Soviet news agency reports that German pressure near Orel has eased, and they are now attempting to penetrate Soviet lines with small units. Enemy tanks attempted to cross the N River but were prevented by Soviet forces, with not a single tank making it across. As for the Soviet-held bank, twenty enemy aircraft were destroyed by the Soviet Air Force at the Orel airfield. On the highway leading to the area, twenty-three enemy tanks, eight armored vehicles, eleven trucks, and fifteen transport vehicles were also destroyed. Yesterday, the German High Command announced in a communiqué that the German army and its allies had gradually expanded their occupation of the Soviet industrial area in the Donets River basin. German forces south of Belinsk cleared the battlefield, captured another 5,000 enemy soldiers, and seized one heavy tank and 56 artillery pieces. Yesterday's Soviet supplementary communiqué reported heavy German losses in the southwest (largely referring to Ukraine). It claimed that in one sector of the front alone, German forces suffered over 5,000 casualties in five days due to attacks by Soviet infantry and tanks. Near the village of Mossomovka, 300 German corpses, ten destroyed tanks, thirteen anti-tank guns, and six armored vehicles were left on the battlefield. In another sector of the front, the Soviet Air Force assisted the ground forces, bombing and killing 25,000 enemy soldiers and destroying 327 trucks, 45 artillery pieces, ten motorized vehicles, and 300 vehicles carrying grain and ammunition.</p>
<p>Stalin and Kalinin Both Remain in Moscow</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 23rd - Moscow Radio announced today that Stalin and Chairman Kalinin will remain in the eastern city of the Soviet Union. Yesterday, Stalin issued an order promoting several air force officers. At the same time, he also awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and the Gold Star Medal to those who had fought bravely and exemplified the execution of orders.</p>

<h3>Chips Absorbed Drier and Drier, Gold Price Exceeds 16,000 Yuan Mark, Six Consecutive Days of Increases Totaling 5,590 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot trading was completely manipulated by reckless speculators. First, they pressed down, then vigorously raised prices, creating a day of breathtaking fluctuations of 1,940 yuan. At the opening, Tianjin interests heavily sold 300 to 400 taels, once pushing the price down to 14,460 yuan. However, in an instant, a certain bank and the Hong Kong-Chaozhou group showed a tendency to acquire, and the chips suddenly dried up, causing the price to soar. In the afternoon, a new high of 16,400 yuan was reached, a squeeze of 1,580 yuan. The six consecutive days of increases totaling 5,590 yuan can be described as an unprecedented speculative frenzy. Trading volume was 4,500 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Fluctuations Near 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The upward trend in spot prices is difficult to curb and there have already been swings along the way. From the early morning news of Tianjin interests selling, it was 200 yuan lower. De Fu offered 20 taels of "composite" at 14,600 yuan. De Fu and others scrambled to sell, and the price once retreated to 460 yuan. Unexpectedly, Ming Feng and the He Tai Bank successively entered the market, causing the price to soar and break the 5,000 yuan mark. The rise became even faster, totaling over 1,000 yuan. Wan Feng entered the money business with 10 taels at 5,850 yuan. Suddenly, there were certain Sino-Japanese rumors, causing a sharp reversal and decline. Tian Yuan and others scrambled to exit, causing a plunge of 950 yuan to 14,900 yuan. Xiang He vigorously entered with 200-odd taels, exiting in an instant, and closed at 15,150 yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, buyers were eager to enter, and the price was raised to 700 yuan. He Sheng began to enter with 10 taels from Zhong Xing, opening high at 550 yuan. A certain bank and Tong Kang Yong vigorously sold, falling back 350 yuan. Soon, Ming Feng and others started another surge, sellers disappeared, and the price soared again by 1,050 yuan, seeing a new high of 16,400 yuan. Tian Yuan exited again, as did Xiang He, falling to 6,160 yuan. Tian Bao bought in, rising another 200-odd yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 16,380 yuan, an increase of 1,580 yuan compared to the previous day. It has risen for six consecutive days, totaling 5,590 yuan. There were fluctuations of 1,940 yuan on the day. The gold shop's list price for gold was 16,500 yuan, with a reduction of 500-600 yuan for purchases.</p>
<p>Futures Also Squeezed Up 700 Yuan</p>
<p>The October futures market opened in the morning, immediately rising 50 yuan to 8,650 yuan, due to the rise in spot prices. Xiang Xing Yong compensated for short positions on behalf of customers, raising the price to 700 yuan with no sellers. It closed at 8,720 yuan in the afternoon. The market opened 80 yuan higher in the afternoon, and Xiang Xing Yong continued to push for entry, but still had few counterparts, so it rose to a high closing price of 9,300 yuan at 4:00 PM, squeezing up 700 yuan. There was a high-low range of 650 yuan on the day.</p>
<p>Jewelry and Sycee Silver Both Soar</p>
<p>The retail price of jewelry gold at silver shops, Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, increased from 1,490 yuan in the morning to 1,620 yuan, and then dropped back to 1,550 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose again to 1,670 yuan at 4:00 PM, a squeeze of 160 yuan (purchases reduced by 60 yuan). There were twelve changes in the price in one day. Sycee silver also increased by two yuan, reaching 14 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>US Exchange Rate Too Expensive, Transactions Difficult, Gold Notes Not as Firm as Gold Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC posting flat rates. The HSBC small counter also had fixed exchange rates for British and American currencies. The black market for British and American currencies trended towards tightness, entirely because the price of gold was rising, causing suppliers to hoard and refuse to release supply. A certain broker actually quoted a selling price of only three yuan on behalf of Chinese merchants, but importers, although eager to buy, were unwilling to pay too much. Many even offered 3.25 yuan to enter the market, but no transactions were heard throughout the day. Until the late closing at 4:00 PM, the British exchange rate tightened to 2 shillings 0.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate to 3.125 yuan, both unprecedentedly high prices, tightening by 0.0625 and 0.025 yuan respectively compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a surge, with British and American gold pounds each rising by a substantial 60 yuan. The trend of British gold notes remained relatively stable, while American gold notes did not rise as sharply as British and American gold pounds. This is because gold pounds are ultimately coins, while American notes are paper money. Therefore, many people sold off American notes and invested in spot gold and gold pounds, leading to a surge of American note sales and limiting the extent of the increase. The trend of Hong Kong notes remains firm. Japanese and Korean gold notes also trended upwards, with the former rising to 3.40 yuan and the latter to 2.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Rise to Cover Shorts</p>
<p>The government bond market suddenly rebounded yesterday, triggered by the covering of temporary short positions from the previous day, causing general shorts to enter the market. Although there was a small correction in the middle, with Class C bonds seeing a low price of 65.5 yuan, it was immediately followed by a sharp rise, with a high price of 7.3 yuan. Buyers were all covering shorts and there were no investment transactions. Class C bonds opened in the morning at 66.4 yuan, looking peaceful compared to the previous day. In an instant, it broke through 6 yuan and saw a low price of 65.5 yuan. Afterwards, with large-scale short covering, it broke out of 6 yuan again. In the afternoon, there was an intention to push up prices again and re-cover short positions. Class C bonds once again broke through 7 yuan. According to daily statistics, except for Class D bonds, which continued to decrease by 0.3 yuan, all others increased by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. Transaction volume was 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 600 shares of Wing On Company were traded at 42.5 yuan per share. The following dividend was declared by rubber stock companies:</p>
<p>Final Interim</p>
<p>Berham 0.18 Garendon 0.04</p>
<p>Sengkrat Deoli 2.75 Bertram Anon 0.10</p>
<p>Kota Bahru 0.20 Consolidated 0.45</p>
<p>Tomiran 0.60</p>
<p>Supreme 0.50</p>
<p>Johore 0.00</p>
<p>The opening of the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce was stable, then turned uncertain, and the trend was also slightly soft. The market situation did not improve until a few minutes before the close. Jardine's Brewery shares saw a very large trading volume, and the price rose by about one yuan. Steel shares also rose by 2.5 yuan. Rubber shares were relatively quiet.</p>
<h3>Limit-Up for Four Consecutive Days, Uncertain Outcome for Shuang Ma, Spot Sales Completely Eliminated: Coarse Yarn 200 Yuan Cheaper</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be at its daily limit-up, and the market situation is chaotic. This is due to the surge in gold prices, which makes people feel uncertain, but actual transactions have been completely eliminated. Twenty-count Shuang Ma factory orders immediately reached the limit-up level when they opened, and the price of 2,410 yuan was announced to have stopped trading. There were some dark market sales, which pulled back to 385 yuan. Later, the exchange rebounded, and buyers returned, gradually rising to 445 yuan. By this time it was 10:30 AM, and everyone dispersed. After 12:00 noon, it was heard that the exchange's cotton cloth was slightly soft, and it was said that someone wanted to sell at 400 yuan, but few accepted. The market closed as usual in the afternoon. However, the exchange rebounded again at the close due to the return of high gold prices. As for the price of spot yarn, it is 100-200 yuan cheaper than Shuang Ma factory orders. The future of the yarn market is uncertain. Generally, prudent people adopt a cautious approach, because it is running wild every day, at its daily limit-up for four days. Once it hits a wall, there may be bloodshed. This kind of situation is not good for the yarn industry.</p>
<p>The soaring price of Jin Shuang Ma has no end in sight. Although a notice was issued requiring prior payment of margin, it failed to curb the momentum of acquisition. Factory orders have been at their daily limit-up for four days, causing panic. Those short are unable to cover their positions, and new longs are also likely to shrink back. Therefore, although the market price is high, trading has become scarce. October futures opened in the morning because they had not increased sufficiently yesterday, opening at the daily limit-up of 2,269 yuan, and December at 2,290 yuan, 52 yuan higher. The market then went down to 2,258 yuan, and January to 2,280 yuan. Later, due to the unstable fluctuations on the exchange, it also dropped to 2,270 yuan. The market closed at noon, with each increasing by 30 to 100 yuan. In the afternoon, after the near-term positions made up the margin, trading reopened. Although there was no market for factory orders, the cotton exchange suddenly increased to its daily limit-up at the close, and people speculated that it would rise again. November surged to 2,355 yuan at the close, a dramatic increase of 185 yuan. December was 2,358 yuan, and January was 2,355 yuan, each up 100 yuan. A table is listed below.</p>
<h3>After Stopping New Purchases, the Search for Stockpiled Spot Cloth Becomes More Urgent</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, because the cotton exchange stopped new trading, hoarders became even more eager to find spot cloth, and the actual demand in the street market and the occupied areas was strong, causing cloth prices to skyrocket. The price of white goods, coarse and fine cloth and twill increased by 5 yuan to 7.25 yuan per bolt, a new record for the price increase in the cloth market. Due to the wait-and-see attitude of the factories, there was more demand than supply for bleached and dyed cloth and Luen Cheong and Ewo printed cloth bolts, and there was very little trading. The street market traded several thousand bolts of cloth. However, although the demand for goods in the occupied areas such as Dinghai, Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, and Nanjing and Hangzhou was strong, it was still difficult to obtain removal permits.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: After the suspension of new trading in white goods futures, the spot market became lively. It is believed that due to the soaring price of gold, which has no end in sight, speculators are pushing up prices, becoming more and more intense. The latest evening price for Longtou fine cloth bolt was 85.7 yuan, and the price of other miscellaneous fine cloth fine twill also increased by 6-7 yuan per bolt. The morning price for Four Gentlemen Serge was around 2.8 yuan, gradually increasing to 3.15 yuan in the evening, but the rise was too violent, and the reaction will be easy.</p>
<h3>What is the Reason for This Rising Wind?</h3>
<p>This sharp rise began after the Double Tenth Festival holiday, and after two weeks, the situation is completely different from what it was then. The price yesterday, the increase compared to the previous day, and the price on the 11th are listed below.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Jump Wildly, All Exceeding Government-Controlled Rice, Concerns About the Quality of Government-Controlled Rice</h3>
<p>The Ewo cargo ship from Jardine Matheson, the Fook Sang, arrived at the port at around 2:00 PM yesterday, with 5,100 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. (祖)</p>
<p>The upward trend in imported rice became increasingly vigorous. The market opened with the highest price, and after a period of consolidation, it was followed by a step-by-step rise. The prices from Ing Wah Sze had not risen enough the day before, and saw greater activity. The small milled rice from Kiao Chiao Road opened at 178 yuan, then increased from 180 yuan to 182 yuan, which was a jump of 12 yuan compared to the formal price on the day before yesterday. Small milled spot goods opened at 150 yuan and increased to 155 yuan. No. 1 Saigon opened from 164-5 yuan to 170 yuan, and No. 2 opened from 151-2 yuan to 159-8 yuan, all increasing by 7-8 yuan compared to the evening price before. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment increased, the hoarders became even more greedy, and the market price increased by another 2-3 yuan. However, because the Municipal Council used foreign exchange to settle, there were continued inquiries about 9,000 tons of small milled rice at the previous price of 139.76 yuan, and it was rumored that an agreement was possible, so people's minds turned to calm, and the market price returned to 2-3 yuan. The evening closing price was the same as the afternoon closing price. The total transaction volume was more than 30,000 bags, as well as 1,600-700 tons. Other varieties such as No. 1 Tuo Luo opened at 165 yuan, No. 2 at 152 yuan, Min Tang at 157 yuan to 154.5 yuan, Yinhang small milled rice at 155.5 yuan, and Waihang at 154.5 yuan and 154 yuan. Broken pointed rice was as high as 123 yuan, and then 120 yuan, also higher than the Municipal Council's small milled rice. Therefore, the standard of 40% broken rice seems to be that what is sold on the market recently may not be limited to this number, because there are extra fine particles. There are those who say that this is also an inevitable trend. Now a 158-jin bag of small milled rice sells for more than 150 yuan, and the Municipal Council's 160-jin bag sells for only 117 yuan, which is cheaper than broken rice. How can what is sold on the market not be of poor quality, not to mention the color of the Municipal Council's rice. Ordinary eaters only know that the rice shops say that this is the kind of goods, that is the kind of goods, "a blind man looking at a painted wall," and there is no way to tell the quality. Therefore, to run a government sale, there must be only one, and no exceptions are allowed, so that there is a way. But those who are used to doing business, regardless of Chinese or Western, always look at it from a business perspective. In the past week, the price of imported rice has skyrocketed by more than 20 yuan, and has already exceeded the highest peak of the last spring by more than 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice of both thick and thin, new and broken varieties, surged by more than ten yuan. The prices of early broken rice from southern ports, new glutinous rice from Kunshan, and Qingjiao kilned Fengjing Hundred Ge each reached 178 yuan, while Ye Dao from Sijing was particularly outstanding due to its freshness in both dynasties, selling for 180 yuan. However, the prices varied in the early morning, generally around 171 yuan to 173 or 174 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of glutinous rice increased by only 3-4 yuan compared to before, with Hong Kong white rice opening as high as 182 yuan, and then 178 yuan. The price of yellow glutinous rice was only 175 yuan. However, the market price of glutinous tea continued to soar by 7-8 yuan due to the scarcity of goods and insufficient distribution, opening as high as 172.5 yuan, and then 169 yuan.</p>
<p>The buying sentiment for flour was vigorous, and speculation was particularly active. Fort opened at 45.9 yuan, then increased to 46 yuan. Golden Dragon increased from 44.57 yuan to 45 yuan. In the afternoon, long holders who had made profits, in view of the need to realize profits through selling, took the opportunity to return, and the market returned by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The closing price for Fort was 45.89 yuan, Golden Silk 45 yuan, and Golden Dragon 44.89 yuan, each up 0.7-0.8 yuan compared to the previous market. The transaction volume was still 70,000-80,000 bags.</p>
<p>The Continuous Flow of Sugar Northward Stimulates a Sharp Rise in Market Prices</p>
<p>Although it is said that the recent sharp rise in sugar prices was caused by the stimulation of the high gold market, there are two other reasons: (1) In North China, due to the inability to obtain foreign exchange, the direct purchase of sugar has decreased, while the demand has increased, so it has become a trend to transport it from the Shanghai market. Therefore, sugar had just been imported yesterday, and this afternoon 20,300 bags were loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Liangzhou and transported to Tianjin. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's cargo ship Fook Sang, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, brought 1,800 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong and will still transport them to Tianjin on the original ship tomorrow. It can be seen that the number of sugar transported from Shanghai to North China is large, and how can the market price not rise accordingly? (2) Due to the increased transportation, hoarders are led to hold out for higher prices. Therefore, although high prices are repeatedly offered, hoarding is not reduced. Because hoarding does not decrease, the market price is even higher. This cyclical cause and effect leads to sugar prices being unaffordable. Only yesterday, some hoarders took advantage of the high prices to release some sugar, and the trend turned flat.</p>

<h3>British Residents Support Management of Commodity Prices, Suggest Forming Import Association</h3>
<p>If Retailers Raise Prices, Supply will be Cut Off, the Public Should Assist the Authorities' Measures</p>
<p>Municipal Council Resolves to Entrust Jardine Matheson with the Preparation of Low-Priced Flour</p>
<p>The British Residents Association held its bi-weekly meeting at the clubhouse on the Bund on the 21st, chaired by Mr. Coultrap. It was decided that the annual meeting will be held at the racecourse at 5:30 PM on the 7th of next month. At that time, the British Consul General, George, will attend and speak on the War Time Fund.</p>
<p>Public Sympathy is Beneficial and Practical</p>
<p>During the meeting, the issue of managing commodity prices was discussed. It was believed that the British Residents Association should wholeheartedly support the authorities' measures, as public sympathy can assist the authorities in overcoming many difficulties. Some people believe that retailers are largely responsible for disrupting commodity prices at present, so it was suggested to form an association of import merchants to refuse to supply goods to those who violate the legal prices. This move will certainly be of great help in managing retail commodity prices.</p>
<p>Entrusting Jardine Matheson with the Preparation of Low-Priced Flour</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, at its special meeting last week, resolved to continue to sell low-priced flour, similar to the method of selling low-priced Hong Kong rice. According to information obtained by a Greater China News Agency reporter, the Municipal Council is still entrusting the British firm Jardine Matheson with preparing the matter. The firm has now begun to investigate the business situation and sales volume of the wholesale merchants and retail stores in the city that distribute flour. Once the investigation is completed, it will be reported to the authorities for reference. At the same time, the Municipal Council is requesting the Stabilization Fund to apply for foreign exchange to transport and sell flour. According to banking sources, the Stabilization Fund may approve it.</p>
<p>After Supplying Foreign Exchange, the Selling Price can Fall</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the actual daily sales volume of flour in the city is 10,000 bags, and the monthly demand is 300,000 bags. The current price per bag has been manipulated by speculators to more than 40 yuan. If legal foreign exchange can be obtained, the selling price can be reduced by more than ten yuan. It is heard that the low-priced flour will be supplied by a large flour mill in Hong Kong. The mill is very large in scale, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of supply to meet the city's needs. It is also learned that the Futung and Foohsin flour mills in the city have suspended work for several months due to the Japanese monopoly over the source of wheat from the mainland. As a result, the source of flour for consumption in the city must be transported from the United States, Australia, and other places, which has caused the price to be manipulated by speculators.</p>
<h3>Tedoff Punished, Escorted to Isolated Island to Serve Sentence</h3>
<p>According to information from the United States diplomatic mission in China, Mr. Douse, the retired traffic director of the Municipal Council eleven years ago, has now been appointed as a special deputy executive officer, responsible for escorting Tedoff to McNair Island to serve his sentence. Mr. Munce was sworn in yesterday, with Mr. Curling administering the oath. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Tyler, which will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Powell Frightened Last Night</h3>
<p>Bomb Touched His Shoulder, Luckily Did Not Explode and Fell to the Ground</p>
<p>J.B. Powell, the American editor of the "China Weekly Review," has been a journalist in the Far East for many years, upholding justice and enjoying a high reputation. Powell's residence is at the Citibank building on Fuzhou Road, and his office is at 160 Edward Road. Every day, he commutes between his office and residence. As the journey is not short, he often walks. Recently, Powell, feeling the environment was not ideal, hired a bodyguard to accompany him. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Powell and his bodyguard left his office on Edward Road and walked to Sichuan Road, in front of the Downer Building, when someone suddenly threw a paper package at him from behind, hitting him on the shoulder, and immediately falling to the ground. Powell was greatly surprised and quickly bent down to examine it, seeing a paper package wrapped in newspaper on the ground. Upon opening it, he was shocked to find it was a hand grenade, fortunately not exploded. His bodyguard turned back to check, but the thrower had disappeared. It is heard that Powell recently wrote an article in the "China Weekly Review" that was quite implicating, which may be the reason for this bombing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Embassy in Japan Counselor and Others Leave Japan for Shanghai, Returning to America</h3>
<p>Major Merrill, the military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Japan, and Leiner, the attaché at the Argentine Embassy in Japan, arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo yesterday and will transfer to an American steamer to go to America. Mr. Leiner will take up his new position as the Argentine Consul-General in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Allied Nationals in Shanghai Do Their Best to Donate to the National Crisis</h3>
<p>Women Collectively Work to Knit Clothes and Socks; British Nationals Collect and Sell Waste Paper, Transferring the Proceeds to England</p>
<p>Yesterday it was learned that the Allied nationals in Shanghai, in addition to donating to war funds, are also making various other contributions. According to a member of the Allied Nationals Joint Committee in this city,</p>
<p>Norwegian nationals in Shanghai are currently sending knitted goods to troops stationed in the Near East. Norwegian merchants and family members of consular diplomats gather weekly to knit woolen socks and underwear to donate to soldiers.</p>
<p>Polish nationals in Shanghai send an average of 10,000 comfort bags to Singapore each month to support the troops. The bags contain cigarettes, razors, toothpaste, sweets, and vegetables.</p>
<p>The British Women's Association has been continuously collecting large quantities of clothing, socks, and other necessities since the start of the European war, transporting them to various central locations in England for distribution to the troops. These items are donated by all parties, not limited to British women.</p>
<p>Greek nationals are also doing their part in the war. Under the leadership of Yannoulatos, the Greek Consul-General, they donate monthly to help the Greek Red Cross. This money is transferred to the Greek government in London.</p>
<p>The activities of Dutch nationals are varied. They also hold weekly meetings and publish an illustrated weekly magazine, with all proceeds donated to military expenses. The former Dutch Minister to China, Sobeck, and his wife founded this weekly magazine and have now been entrusted with a government mission to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, but the weekly magazine continues to be published. Finally, the British Residents Association's</p>
<p>Waste Paper Committee collects waste paper and sells it to Chinese paper mills. The proceeds are handed over to the British Residents Central War Fund Committee, which, together with other donations, is transferred to the Lord Mayor of London. On average, £10,000 is transferred monthly. As of September 30, waste paper sales alone had yielded over 154,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Various Circles Form慰劳Group to the Northern Hunan Frontlines to Console the Troops</h3>
<p>A Group of Seven Led by Jiang Bocheng Left Shanghai Before the Double Tenth Festival and Has Now Arrived in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd telegram, With the major victory of the Chinese army in Northern Hunan, various places have organized consolation groups or remitted funds for consolation. Various circles in Shanghai have delegated representatives to organize a consolation group, which left Shanghai before the Double Tenth Festival and has already arrived in Hong Kong. The group of seven, led by Jiang Bocheng, will join Shanghai and Hong Kong business circles to go to the frontlines to console the troops.</p>
<h3>American and French Merchant Ships Continue to Operate, Nanyang Shipping is Agile</h3>
<p>Overseas Traffic Shows No Signs of Stagnation; World Liners Shorten Shanghai-U.S. Voyage</p>
<p>The Shanghai overseas traffic and cargo transport issues that are closely watched by the general public have not deteriorated due to the trend of the situation. According to a New Voices News Agency reporter's inquiries from authorities in the shipping industry yesterday, Shanghai's overseas traffic routes are still far from a serious stage. The overseas traffic routes that continue to be maintained or are newly emerging after the war include: (1) the American President Lines and its agent, the American Pioneer Shipping Company. American Mail Line and Rootes-Berks Lines and other American Far East Lines, the ships included are the President liner, as well as the Arava, Fleetline, Dorothy, and Halle, etc. (2) the French Steamship Company's D'Artagnan and Kindia, etc., sailing on the Saigon-Shanghai line. (3) the Java Mail Line's Shanghai-Hong Kong-Java line, with ships such as the Tjisaroea, etc. (4) the Dollar Line, such as the Calawaii, Cardina, Carmona, and Capena, sailing between Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Los Angeles, and New York. (5) the KPM Line, represented by the Java Company, whose ships sail from Shanghai to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, etc., now all transship in Hong Kong. (6) the Burns Philip Line's Shanghai-Australia line. (7) the Jardine Matheson Line's Nanyang line, with ships such as the Glen Line Norseman, sailing between Shanghai-Saigon-Shanghai-Burma. (8) Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Osaka Shosen Kaisha, etc. The cargo transport range of the above-mentioned shipping companies includes the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaya, Nanyang, Australia, Vietnam, South Africa, and other places. Other European countries cannot be directly reached in practice, but can only be transshipped through the United States, but their importance is not as great as before.</p>
<p>American Flags Flutter on the Pacific</p>
<p>Although the freight rates of the above-mentioned ships have increased, they can always maintain the cargo transport without interruption. In the Pacific Ocean, American ships are now second to none. Between Canada, the United States, Honolulu, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, American flags flutter everywhere. Because the situation is unpredictable, the mission of these ships is extremely important. Since Britain is fully focused on the Atlantic, the Empress liners of the China Navigation Company of Russia, Japan, Asia, and Canada, as well as the mail ships of the British Shipping Company, have all withdrawn from the Pacific and been transferred back to serve military transport. Therefore, the original routes of British ships are all replaced by American ships. Although many American President Liners have been requisitioned for military use, the U.S. Maritime Commission is still rushing to build 200 new ships, scheduled to be completed within the year, allocated to both oceans to maintain shipping. The aforementioned Avana and Fleetline, etc., are all newly built. Therefore, cargo transport in the Pacific can still maintain a normal state. As for the itineraries of American Mail ships being kept secret, it is only for security purposes and has nothing to do with the progress of shipping.</p>
<p>Strive for Agility in Nanyang Cargo Transport</p>
<p>In terms of Nanyang shipping, the most important are the above-mentioned French lines, Java, Warun, Burns Philip, the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Manila line of the American Mail Line, and world liner lines, etc. The ports in this area with the most commercial and industrial characteristics are Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Saigon, Yangon, Haiphong, Java, and Melbourne. The trade of Nanyang, in the current situation, is closely related to . The main shipping companies are all undertaken by the United States, the Netherlands, and France. However, since the situation in the Far East once became tense, there was a saying that Dutch ships would suspend their operations in the Far East, but this has not yet been clarified. The ships of the French shipping company generally go directly from Saigon or Haiphong to Shanghai without relying on Hong Kong, and sometimes continue to sail from Shanghai to Japan. The main task is to load necessities such as rice and coal. The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Philippines line of American merchants and the world liner lines are quite powerful. Recently, there have also been ships dedicated to releasing new Jia Slope. The regular route of the World Liner of the American President Company is Boston, New York, the Panama Canal, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, Shanghai (at present, American ships generally do not bay Japan), Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, Ceylon, Bombay, the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and back to the United States across the Atlantic. This line circles the globe, with Shanghai as its center, which is of great help to cargo transport. In order to expedite Sino-American shipping, the company has shortened the voyage of the World Liner ships, starting from the United States and sailing south to Singapore only, without going to Bombay or the Cape of Good Hope to return to the United States, that is, returning from Singapore and returning to the United States along the original route.</p>
<p>Inland River Shipping Is Extremely Bleak</p>
<p>As for inland river shipping, such as the Huangpu River, Suzhou River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River, various countries competed fiercely for transport ships before the war, but now it is completely monopolized and manipulated. At present, there are many monopolized companies, but their ships are simple and the equipment is poor. Pearl River shipping is also quite bleak. The actions of ships on the Pujiang and Suzhou Rivers are even narrower. Moreover, before the war, Jardine Matheson and Taikoo accounted for the majority of North and South Ocean shipping. Now, because Jardine Matheson and Taikoo ships have been requisitioned for other purposes, and are subject to severe obstruction and restrictions, there has been no improvement.</p>
<p>Transfer of 89 Chinese Ships</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, since the outbreak of the war, 89 Chinese merchant ships have been transferred to foreign merchants for operation to ensure protection, totaling 139,000 tons. Among them, Portuguese merchants have the most, with 28 ships and more than 11,000 tons. Italian merchants have 14 ships, and their tonnage far exceeds that of Portuguese merchants, totaling more than 30,000 tons. American merchants have one ship, only 31 tons. The detailed statistics are recorded as follows: (1) American merchants, 1 ship, 31 tons; (2) British merchants, 3 ships, 8,566 tons; (3) German merchants, 5 ships, 6,637 tons; (4) Italian merchants, 14 ships, 35,857 tons; (5) Portuguese merchants, 28 ships, 17,174 tons; (6) Norwegian merchants, 7 ships, 21,209 tons; (7) Dutch merchants, 2 ships, 6,525 tons; (8) Greek merchants, 15 ships, 31,299 tons; (9) Other, 14 ships, 1,882 tons.</p>
<h3>Weaving Mills Reduce Work</h3>
<p>After Oyam, the Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Customs at Jianghai Customs, issued a notice on October 18 prohibiting the export and transshipment of cotton yarn piece goods and other textiles, various industries in Shanghai have been greatly affected. Although it is stipulated that those with special permits are not subject to this restriction, attempts to transport goods to Hong Kong and various parts of Nanyang, and to various free areas transshipped from Yangon, have been rejected. Only those who can obtain permits are those in the occupied areas. As a result, there is no actual sales transaction in the cotton yarn market, and all are bought and sold by speculators. Cotton weaving, towel weaving, sock weaving, and other factories have been forced to suspend night work or reduce some work. Industries that have always regarded the Nanyang gang as the largest customers have been hit even harder. Recently, foreign merchant ships sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong have had no cotton yarn or cotton textile exports, and the business of shipping companies has also been affected.</p>
<p>Paulis Industry Labor Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the Western-style wood industry, Paulis, has been resolved satisfactorily. The wage increase item has also been agreed upon. Since September, all workers have received a uniform increase of 45%. The workers in each store resumed work yesterday.</p>
<h3>Although Flour Prices Are Rampant, Buns and Mantou Are Not Increased</h3>
<p>The People's Essential Food, Related to the General Life</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has investigated the total number of flour dealers currently operating in this city in order to handle sales matters in the future. Its flat-price sales method will be realized soon. Recently, various flour products, including biscuits and cut noodles, have successively increased in price due to the shadow of rampant flour prices. It is learned that the Shanghai Buns and Mantou Trade Association issued a notice to all shopkeepers yesterday, the original text of which reads, "At this time of high flour prices and increased costs, the retail price should be appropriately modified, but this time the Municipal Council has detailed plans to deal with the illegal price increases of speculative flour merchants, which is deeply admired. We investigate our buns and mantou foods as a daily necessity for the city's civilians. If prices are increased again, it will be related to the entire society and life. We specially inform all members that before the Municipal Council's flat-price flour method is implemented, we still hope to maintain the original price, with large buns and mantou limited to 5 cents to 1 dime per piece, and no private price increases are allowed, or penalties will be imposed in accordance with industry regulations."</p>
<h3>Japanese Banks Speculate in Cotton Yarn, Losing Millions of Dollars</h3>
<p>Due to Jianghai Customs' Ban on Exports, Massive Dumping, Unexpectedly Violent Rebound, Replenishment Too Late</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that, according to business sources, several Japanese banks here have recently engaged in speculative activities in the Shanghai cotton market, resulting in losses of millions of dollars. First, Japanese banks heard that Jianghai Customs would prohibit all cotton goods from being exported from Shanghai, so they engaged in massive dumping activities in the cotton market, expecting that the result of the export ban would be a drop in cotton prices. Unexpectedly, several days after the export ban, cotton prices soared, with no signs of weakness. Japanese banks hurriedly replenished their positions, but cotton prices rose step by step, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<h3>9,000 Tons of Coal Arrived, Price Stabilization Association Will Fully Supply Coal to the Shanghai Market Within the Required Range</h3>
<p>Large amounts of coal have arrived in Shanghai in recent days. The Panama merchant ship Nort, managed by Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, brought a large amount of coal from Java, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the God Bless ship of the Elong Company, managed by the same company, also brought 1,880 tons of coal from the Dutch East Indies, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and berthed at pontoons 30 and 30A to unload. Three Taikoo ships also brought large quantities of Kailan coal. The Chengdu ship arrived at the port the day before yesterday (22nd), bringing 2,200 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Suzhou ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also bringing 2,500 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Nanning ship arrived at the port on the same day as the Suzhou ship, also bringing 2,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. All three ships are berthing at the Kailan Coal Stack pier to unload. The coal situation in this city has revealed a glimmer of dawn, due to the Price Stabilization Association's approval of the consideration of supply and transfer. However, the Price Stabilization Association pays close attention to the coal supply in this city, giving it the same importance as rice, and will never allow a coal shortage to occur at any time, so there is no need to worry.</p>

<h3>Various Public Groups Telegraph Authorities to Promulgate Measures for Handling Rent, Requesting the Application of the Rent Dispute Regulations of the Provisional Capital, and Requesting that All Levels of Courts in This City Quickly Comply</h3>
<p>Various public groups in this city, in view of the increasingly fierce housing rental disputes and the increasingly serious housing problem for citizens, jointly submitted a petition to the authorities, requesting that the Ministry of Justice quickly order all levels of courts in this city to handle rent and lease dispute cases, applying the housing rental measures of the provisional capital, in order to stabilize the people's residence. An excerpt is given below</p>
<p>Original Petition as follows</p>
<p>"Ever since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai has surged, and landlords have taken the opportunity to increase rents arbitrarily. The root cause lies in the fact that landlords are using the urgent need for housing to strictly set deadlines for tenants, ranging from six months to a year. Every time the term expires, they first notify the tenants to move out, forcing them to increase rents and making all kinds of demands, endlessly extracting and taking as they please, increasing the burden on residents day by day, and causing frequent rent disputes. According to the law, there are no provisions to prevent this kind of abuse, allowing this special situation to</p>
<p>Escalate</p>
<p>It is thought that most tenants come from war zones, having already suffered great damage in their hometowns, and come to Shanghai to take refuge, only to be repeatedly subjected to the suffering of landlords' clever seizure and extortion. If this trend is not curbed, how can the people's livelihood endure? It is appropriate to issue laws and strictly restrict them. The provisional capital has promulgated seventeen articles of housing rental measures, of which Article 8 stipulates that if the lease has a term, in addition to the situation where the landlord recovers it for his own use upon the expiration of the term stipulated in Article 11, if the tenant notifies one month before the expiration of the term, continuing to lease under the original lease conditions, the landlord</p>
<p>Must Not Refuse</p>
<p>Article 9 stipulates that if the landlord refuses to accept the rent paid by the tenant on a monthly basis in accordance with the lease, the tenant may deposit the rent in accordance with the law. Article 10 stipulates that if the tenant sublets part or all of the house in accordance with the provisions of Article 443, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, the rent shall be calculated according to the proportion of the original rent and shall not exceed 20%. Article 11 stipulates that when the lease expires, or if the lease has no fixed term, if the landlord recovers the house for his own use, he must notify the tenant three months in advance, obtain a guarantee from the local Baojia chief, and apply to Chongqing City for permission.</p>
<p>The aforementioned recovered houses shall not be leased in whole or in part to a third party by the landlord within one year. The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis to the transferee under Article 425 of the Civil Code. If the above provisions can be applied to the citizens of this city, they will benefit immensely.

<h3>YMCA Promotes Filial Piety Movement Second Annual Parents' Day</h3>
<p>The Boys' Department of the Young Men's Christian Association believes that our country has been known throughout the world as a land of etiquette and righteousness, and filial piety is especially admired by people. At this time of conflict between new and old morals, young people often neglect and despise the way of filial piety, disobeying the wishes of their parents, wasting money, breaking away from their parents, and cases of discrediting ethics emerge one after another. In order to revive the old morals and promote the inherent virtues of thousands of years, October was designated as Filial Piety Month last year (implying not forgetting the ten months of pregnancy), and the last Sunday of the month was designated to treat parents well and present them with gifts of grace (self-created). As the 26th of this month is the last Sunday, it is scheduled to gather members on this day to hold the Second Annual Parents' Day. In addition to preparing tea and snacks to entertain the parents of members, there will also be musical performances. In addition, enthusiastic publicity is being carried out in various church schools and Christian groups to promote filial piety and save the declining trend.</p>

<h3>Thefts in Shanghai (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Min</p>
<p>The prevalence of theft in Shanghai has been rampant, especially in recent years. Robberies and thefts occur daily. Although the methods of Shanghai thieves are not as sophisticated as those of American thieves, their means of selling stolen goods through pawnshops or receivers in the two concessions are similar to those of American thieves. Once property is robbed, it is mostly impossible to find it, because citizens rarely know the details of the stolen items. However, about one-third of stolen property is recovered by the Criminal Division of the Police Department using clever methods. If citizens record the characteristics of easily stolen items, it will be easier for the Police Department to investigate and recover the stolen goods more quickly.</p>
<p>Taking watches as an example, many citizens know the brand names of their watches, but how many remember the numbers engraved on them? Therefore, after pickpockets steal valuable items such as watches in crowds, the original owner often has no way to track them down. Whenever a robbery occurs, the police immediately prepare a list of the names and values of the stolen items. Robbery victims often inflate the value of the stolen property, causing the police officers investigating the case many difficulties and even misleading the investigation, thus delaying the recovery of the stolen goods.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division of the Medical Department issues a notice every day to pawnshops in the Public Concession. The notice is printed in Chinese and English and contains the names of stolen and robbed items. If a pawnshop receives stolen goods listed in the notice, it must report to the Police Department. Detectives investigating robbery cases routinely investigate pawnshops, and if stolen goods are found, there is a possibility of prosecuting the pawnshop owner.</p>
<p>In addition to pawnshops, the city's thieves entrust receivers to sell stolen goods. Receivers often meet with thieves at locations they believe are unknown to the police, exchanging stolen goods for money. Therefore, it is difficult for the original owner to find the lost items, especially jewelry. Among valuables, rings are the most difficult to trace. Receivers often remove the jewels after buying rings and resell them to jewelers, who redesign them and take them to other cities to sell. If the rings are made of gold or silver, they are melted into blocks and sold.</p>

<h3>Landlords Show Understanding, School Building Disputes Decrease</h3>

Since the national crisis, some have been forced to close due to pressure from landlords, and many more are suffering and unable to focus on education, which is truly appalling.

<h3>Hong Kong Football Association Decides on Interport Games to Be Held in Hong Kong During the Lunar New Year; Other Teams Will Be Invited If the Shanghai Team Cannot Attend</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The Hong Kong Football Association held a committee meeting to discuss the venue and personnel for the Poppy Day charity match on November 11, and also made some decisions on the upcoming (1941-1942) Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match. The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport match has a history of more than 30 years, held once a year, alternately in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In 1938, when it was Shanghai's turn to host the competition, Hong Kong did not send a team due to the Sino-Japanese War. The following year, it failed to materialize for the same reason. In 1940, the Shanghai Westerners' Football Club tried its best to invite the Hong Kong team to Shanghai. The Hong Kong Football Association selected an all-Westerner representative team, led by Dalihanshan Nu, as the leader and captain, to go to Shanghai because the Chinese players were unwilling to participate. As a result, the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport match, which had been suspended for two years, was resumed. The Shanghai team was originally scheduled to visit Hong Kong for a return match during the 1940-1941 football season. Unfortunately, at that time, the Shanghai Westerners' Association again raised issues such as player leave, berths, landing, and guarantees due to the unpredictable situation in the Far East. After many telegrams and letters were exchanged, the Shanghai side finally replied that the environment did not permit it and that it could not be done, and looked forward to next year. Now that the current football season has begun, the Hong Kong Football Association has set the date of February 14, 15, and 16 next year (that is, the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year) for the interport match. The Association, in view of the time spent on arranging the previous match, discussed the matter at this month's committee meeting in advance. If the Shanghai team breaks its promise again, other interport matches such as Hong Kong-Philippines or Hong Kong-Vietnam can be arranged as early as possible to add some flair.</p>
<h3>Second Act of Charity Basketball Game: Show Postponed to Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Black Man Cup Charity Final: Tickets Go on Sale</h3>

In order to increase charity income and arouse audience interest, the authorities specially invited Wen Lant亭and Yuan Ludeng to invite the Mixed Team to play against Leyou in an exhibition match. The program is exceptionally exciting. Guests are bound to be crowded at the time, so tickets have gone on sale. The tickets are divided into four types: 10 yuan honorary tickets, 5 yuan sponsorship tickets, and 2 yuan and 1 yuan. The pre-sale points are located at the head office of Huizhong Bank at 579 Henan Road and the Poor Children's Education Institute on Jiaozhou Road. The income from the tickets, excluding expenses, will all be allocated to the funds of the Poor Education Institute and the Poor Children's Arts and Crafts Institute. Those holding the honorary tickets and sponsorship tickets from the previous time can enter the venue to watch. All the prizes have been arranged by Cheng Zhiliang and Wei Shigeng. The championship silver cup is tall and magnificent, unprecedented in miniature football games.

No tickets will be sold. Zhang Junyuan, Li Feixiang, Yang Changjia, Li Zaichun, and Yang Changxi were given the right to final.

<h3>Quickly Stop the Soaring Prices of Daily Necessities!</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>The soaring prices of daily necessities these days have truly reached a point of "sunstroke"! Citizens are frantic and indescribable. If this continues, how can they bear it! Speculators create rumors and cause trouble, stirring up trouble and fishing in troubled waters. It has reached its extreme! Not to mention hardware building materials, wool fabrics, medicines, and raw materials for the chemical industry, which are handled by them, even the most basic daily necessities are full of traps. The Shanghai Machined Noodles Industry Association suggested to the Public Works Department a few days ago that the existing flour in each warehouse should be assessed at a standard selling price and ordered to be sold publicly. This is a pressing requirement. It is learned that the Stabilization Fund will also approve the Public Works Department's application for flour.</p>
<p>Rice and noodles are indispensable, but at present, a small bowl of Yangchun noodles has risen from 25 cents to 30 cents, then to 35 cents, and then to 45 cents! As for rice, not counting the mixing of inferior rice, the listing of warehouse rice has also been cancelled, and the black market is prevalent, making it difficult for citizens to make ends meet. Fortunately, the authorities have formally announced a refutation of the rumors, and the maximum retail price of foreign rice is still 117 yuan per stone, and illegal sales are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>What about other daily necessities? Soap has risen from 50 cents to 60 cents per bar; kerosene has risen from 70 cents or 80 cents to 90 cents per catty... Matches have risen from 20 cents to 25 cents per box! In short, everything is rising, and those who hoard make money. Everyone is asking the authorities to manage the prices of various daily necessities, and the authorities have also expressed some intentions.</p>
<p>We believe that at the final juncture, it is imperative to implement public sales and let the authorities be responsible for the import of various items, engaging in citizen consumer cooperation, which is also possible and necessary. Therefore, it is believed that the act of evading transportation to Shanghai, resulting in shortages here, can be corrected by adjusting cooperation or even replacing it. Moreover, hoarding families can still make a lot of profits under standard prices. Now or in the future, warehouses do not mind lacking mountains of goods.</p>
<p>In the past, the authorities assessed and set price limits for rice and coal, and the results were effective. This time, the authorities should manage prices and public sales in response to objective and urgent demands, and there is no fear of failure. However, it is hoped that it will proceed "cautiously" and more "quickly" and "correctly," so that social order can be given more consideration. If not, the hoarding families will cry and make trouble, and the only way is to dispose of them decisively. This can enable the public to escape from water and fire and ascend to comfort. It is also a method of awakening for the hoarding families themselves, saving them from the inevitable situation in the future where someone will use the stockpiled goods in the warehouse for some unpaid application.</p>

<h3>Buying Rice</h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>Because I used to work in a rice store for a short time, I am quite familiar with rice. Therefore, I was assigned to do the rice buying for the whole house.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the counter of the rice store, I picked up a handful of rice and casually asked, "Hey, what's the price of No. 1 rice now?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and sixty-two."</p>
<p>"Oh, let me see a handful—rice that's worth the price." As I spoke, I casually revealed the tone of an insider.</p>
<p>The shop assistant was quite attentive, but when I fiddled with the so-called No. 1 rice in the shop assistant's palm, I showed a look of displeasure, although that kind of rice store trick was what I expected. I asked, "Is this really No. 1 rice?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But don't talk nonsense, this is clearly Min rice, and you're still saying it's No. 1!" Min rice has very long grains and is white. Mixed in with rice, it's really something that outsiders can't tell. Some people might even say that this kind of rice mixed with Min rice is good. But if the rice store man wants to deceive me, he's really made a mistake. I said, "Friend, if I wanted to buy Min rice, I would ask you for Min rice. Now I'm asking you for rice!"</p>
<p>The rice store man was a little embarrassed and quickly changed his tune, saying, "We have rice."</p>
<p>"What's the price?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and seventy-two."</p>
<p>"Didn't you just say that No. 1 rice was one hundred and sixty-two yuan? What's going on now?"</p>
<p>"..." The shop assistant couldn't answer.</p>
<p>"The price is too expensive, I don't want it."</p>
<p>The shop assistant was simply getting annoyed with me. But in order to try to get some advantage, I negotiated with him again: "So what's the price of the Public Works Department rice now?"</p>
<p>"We sell it for one hundred and seventeen yuan, the same as other stores."</p>
<p>"Okay, then I'll buy one stone." I said, "But you'd better show me a sample."</p>
<p>The shop assistant handed me a sample of Public Works Department rice. I thought; he must know that I'm an insider, but no, the shop assistant still wanted to deceive me one more time. After looking at the rice sample, I said with displeasure, "Is this Public Works Department rice? Then, then——you haven't cheated people, have you."</p>
<p>The rice store shop assistant timidly said, "How can we cheat customers?"</p>
<p>The words sounded nice, but I suspected that he was cheating me!</p>
<p>"Sir, if you want to buy, we'll pick out one stone that's especially good for you."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I became firm again. I said, "I don't want you to pick out a stone that's especially good. I'm buying Public Works Department rice from you, I just want you to give me Public Works Department rice."</p>
<p>When I left, the shop assistant gave me a deep look. I told them the address, and after a while, the rice was delivered.</p>
<h3>Be Careful When Mailing Letters</h3>
<p>— Liu Jie</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I was passing by Jing'an Temple Road, I saw the green mailbox standing alone on the sidewalk, so I dropped off a letter. When I dropped it off, someone else was dropping off a letter there. He dropped it off and ran, not knowing that his letter had leaked out. I picked it up and dropped it in together with mine, but it came back out. It was really strange. On closer inspection, I saw that there was a very large letter leaning slightly outward against the opening. Later, after I touched it several times, it fell down. Judging from the sound, there wasn't just one letter; there were three or four large ones. I wondered who was so careless. You should know that although the mailbox is large, the entrance is very narrow, and the upper and lower lips are very thick.</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, the United States often found letters with missing stamps. One day, a patrolman saw several children reaching into the mailbox, so he arrested them. The result of the investigation was that they had stolen countless letters that were stuck in the mailbox. With this "lesson from the past," we must be careful.</p>
<p>When I mail letters, I often see one or two letters left at the opening of the mailbox. If they happen to be encountered by despicable people, they will steal them, tear off the stamps as before, and then tear up the letters. Wouldn't this be a loss for you?</p>
<p>Leaving the letters at the mailbox opening is not only a loss for him personally, but also has a significant impact on others, just like yesterday's letter. It is as immoral as four or five people walking shoulder-to-shoulder on the sidewalk, and even more so.</p>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p>— February</p>
<p>——Excuse me, sir, have you seen any police officers around here?</p>
<p>——No, I haven't seen a single shadow.</p>
<p>——Very good, then please hand over your coat and wallet to me together.</p>
<h3>Firewood Vendor Cheats and Donates Money to Help Students</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that this afternoon, while buying firewood, I noticed that the seller suddenly inserted a small iron block, about an inch long, into the gap where the weight was placed on the scale, adding about 50 catties to the weight (I became suspicious because the weight suddenly increased at that time). I hurriedly checked the scale, and he forcibly pulled off the iron block and tried to run away. Then I realized his fraudulent behavior. Everyone questioned him, and he could not escape. Knowing that he was wrong, he pleaded repeatedly. Considering that he was operating on a small scale, we finally agreed that he would pay ten yuan in national currency to be used for charitable purposes, and said that future transactions would be fair and without deception. Now, I am attaching the ten yuan in national currency to this letter, asking your newspaper to transfer it to the student aid fund to benefit many students. Also, in order to expose the bad habits of merchants in society, I am specifically listing the true facts in the hope that</p>
<p>Your column will publish a corner as a mirror for careful shopping, specially, respectfully wish you peace.</p>
<p>Zhou Qi, No. 3, Lane 1265, Edward Road, 30, 10, 17. Editor's note: This kind of cheating by vendors is quite common in the market, and customers should be aware of it to avoid being deceived. The money sent by Mr. Zhou will be allocated to the student aid fund of this newspaper and will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Fourteen: Living the Life of a Fallen Hero</p>
<p>"Dad, I saw in the newspaper that they're hiring female staff. I'll go try it out later, okay?" Mei Bao said, spreading the borrowed Shen Bao newspaper on her lap, looking very excited.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang initially strongly opposed it, because he viewed Shanghai as such a terrible place that he simply didn't want his daughter to go out alone and come into contact with the air of Shanghai. Later, Mei Bao said very firmly:</p>
<p>"Instead of sitting at home and stubbornly waiting for death, why not go out and take a chance? It's not like everyone in Shanghai is a bad person!"</p>
<p>In the end, Qiu Haitang accepted Mei Bao's suggestion. They tidied up their clothes together and rushed to the company that had placed the advertisement. This company was indeed very formal, but there were too many people applying; and the minimum qualification they stipulated was a junior high school diploma, which Mei Bao didn't have. Although the examiner was willing to be flexible, Shanghai treats English as the "national language," and commercial institutions pay particular attention to it. Mei Bao received her education in the north from a young age, and her English proficiency was very limited. She couldn't even handle a few conversational sentences, let alone anything else. (244)</p>

<h3>The Problem of Female Performers in Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Di Feng</p>
<p>The other day I watched the Shanghai Bank's Kunqu Opera dress rehearsal, which made me suddenly wonder why the Xian Ni Society doesn't train a few female performers? Because Shaoxing opera, Shanghai opera, spoken drama, storytelling, all have graceful and charming women, and they even have to be the leading stars. Shanghai people watch opera and first pay attention to the female roles, especially those who are beautifully made up, move nimbly, have gorgeous costumes, and convey emotions with their eyes. Old and young, wives and concubines, all want to come and enjoy the show.</p>
<p>Kunqu opera has several plays with righteous and inspiring themes, such as Wu Zixu Sending His Son, Su Wu Longing for Home, Jianwen's Tragic Sight, and Zhen'e Assassinating the Tiger. Watching them will not make you lose your ambition. If female performers sing The Good Time and Thinking of the Mortal World, it will suit the tastes of regular theatregoers, and there will definitely be many popular people in the audience.</p>
<p>Someone said to me that singing Kunqu opera requires good vocal power and a master flute player. Women's voices are always soft and delicate. Only Dan roles can barely manage, and it would not be successful to sing Zheng Sheng. However, male and female performances are not related. Chen Miaochang in Qin Tiao and Xie Suqiu in Ting Hui perfectly match their roles. If you're talking about female Lao Sheng singers, they are also extremely rare in Peking opera and spoken drama. Even singing Xiao Sheng might not be suitable, because women have big butts, making stage movements inconvenient. Only Shaoxing opera can add them without any problem.</p>
<p>Suzhou women's original Suzhou dialect is very soft and pleasant to listen to. It is a natural talent. Zheng Chuanjian and Zhang Chuanfang are from this area and can be invited to select two beautiful women from their relatives and friends to learn and practice. Once they are on stage, Kunqu opera can definitely be revived, and it will be sold out.</p>
<h3>Federal Film. Federal Stock is Plentiful</h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>The Federal Company is organized by several companies including Tuanlian, Jinxing, Guohua, and Minhua and specializes in Dupont movie film. Now that the source of Dupont film is about to be cut off, this reporter visited Mr. Bian Yuying, the person in charge of the company, who said: "Federal still has more than two million yuan in stock, which can probably meet the needs of various companies until the end of April next year. At the same time, it has already telegraphed the US headquarters to purchase two million yuan, so as to send it as quickly as possible. This batch of new goods will probably also last for about half a year. However, at this time of shortage, Baobang Film, in addition to only supplying to related companies such as Guolian, Jinxing, Guohua, and Minhua, refuses new customer purchases. This matter was decided by the board of directors the day before yesterday."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Flying Curtain Theater (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Que Wei</p>
<p>Yang Baosen's performance of the "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" segment was particularly excellent due to the incorporation of Little Yu's vocal techniques and the subtle accompaniment of Yang Baozong's Huqin, resulting in continuous beautiful melodies. Even the cries of the little barbarian were done in falsetto, which was wonderful. The numerous crying segments, again due to the Huqin's peculiar sound, were truly like the cries of a crane in the sky or the calls of a monkey in the Wu Gorge, making it unbearable to listen to. The "flowing water" melody was like a clear spring washing over rocks, capturing the essence of purity. Apart from the "dangling fur and throwing hair" technique, where it couldn't match Fu Ying, in other aspects, Fu Ying was strong and bold, while Baosen was light and skilled, each having their own strengths, with no clear superiority. Zhang Junqiu's portrayal of Princess Tie Jing was not as pleasing as her portrayals of Su San in "Yu Tang Chun," because wearing the Manchu headdress made her face appear too long, and the rouge, applied from the brow to the cheekbones, made the white powder below the nose seem too much, lacking balance. This should be improved in the future. Her voice was very sweet and smooth, but her vocal skills were not yet deeply refined, demonstrating ample ability but insufficient practice. Compared to Cheng Yanqiu's princess, the scene of guessing her inner thoughts featured different facial expressions and vocal techniques for each guess. The several segments of "flowing water" melody had an unparalleled ability to cut through iron. The regrettable aspect was that the beauty of Cheng's singing lies in the transition from loud to soft and from soft to loud, like a silkworm spinning silk, seemingly broken, continuous, present, and absent, enticing the audience to listen more and more, but making it difficult to hear clearly. Those seated further back might have trouble hearing the details. Some have suggested installing a sound system on the Golden Stage, but the amplified sound would lose its natural beauty. The only solution is for ladies from all walks of life to urge Yanqiu to slightly raise his low notes to satisfy the public's desire. That is probably the best hope.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Vowing to Eradicate the Huns, Regardless of Personal Safety</p>
<p>However, I left Beijing in haste without taking Yuan Yuan with me, thinking that I would be returning to Beijing soon, so there was no need to go to that trouble. Who knew that before I could even reach Beijing, the rebel bandits had broken into the capital city, and Yuan Yuan had been captured by the rebel leader Li Chuang, her fate unknown. I missed her terribly and couldn't sleep or eat in peace. Although I have now vowed to lead troops to suppress the rebels, the rebel forces are strong, and I fear that I will not be able to recapture Yanjing and drive away the rebel leader soon. What if this drags on for a long time? What will happen to Yuan Yuan then? I think the best plan would be to send someone secretly to sneak into the capital city and rescue Yuan Yuan from Li Chuang's palace. This is the safest plan. But this task must be done by someone with skill to be effective and safe. Therefore, someone like Kunlun Huangshan is especially rare and valuable. Your flying skills are still good, so I was thinking of having you take a trip to Beijing, assess the situation, and act accordingly. Do you think you can handle it well and happily? Bai Twelve listened to Wu Sangui's words and said, "I am obliged to serve you, General, because of your kindness. But I think my martial arts skills are limited, and it would be difficult for me to enter the capital and rescue her alone. The rebel's palace must be heavily guarded, and I dare not act rashly and betray the General's beloved concubine. However, I know that Captain Zhang and Captain Chen are not only excellent in martial arts on horseback, but also possess extraordinary flying skills, far superior to mine. If the General is determined to rescue his beloved concubine, it will only work if you entrust it to a few of them. I am willing to recommend them as replacements." Wu Sangui nodded after hearing this and said, "You're not wrong. Zhang Cangqiu and the others are indeed extraordinary talents. If they are willing to serve me, that would be the best thing. Go find out their intentions for me, okay? (200)</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Cun Ren</p>
<p>Li Duokui's "Xu Mu Scolding Cao" and Zhao Manyun's "New Cotton Spinning" will be performed and sung on their farewell commemorative day. As for Huang Guiqiu, it must wait until Guan Dayuan arrives in port, scheduled to go on stage at the same time on the second of next month.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun has been hired by Tianchan Theater and has also invited the female role Bai Yuwei. The performance period is tentatively set for one month, with the total salary being nearly 100,000 national currency. They will arrive in Shanghai on the 6th of next month and go on stage before the 14th. The first batch of actors for next spring has been set as Shang Xiaoyun, and his son Shang Changlin will come with him. After the Da Jing class at Yong'an Tianyun Building stopped performing, it was decided to reorganize again, and roles are currently being extended. There is a possibility that the Kun Dan Jiang Yanqin will be hired.</p>
<p>Brief News: Previously, for the 30th birthday of Mr. Luo Wenlou and the full moon of his second son, friends said that he would not make it at 30 and would not make it at 40, so he invited relatives and friends to the Da Li Restaurant, with more than 300 participants. Among the guests, there was a congratulatory speech by Zhang Hepu, a senior member of the silk industry, and there were also Peking opera performances at various ticket halls on the sea, day and night, at the height of the event.</p>
