<h3 id="c8">和戰問題中之日本 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>凡百政治性質的問題，無論其爲一國的或國際的，往往比較他種性質的問題更爲因緣噯昧，表裏逈殊，形態紛雜，虛實錯綜；使聞者見者自始無從體認明白。或且終於感覺迷茫；然而某一種問題或者祗須看準了其中的一點，便得覷破似乎玄之又玄的一切者，亦往往而有之。</p>
<p>據昨日華盛頓電訉，美國國務卿赫爾氏對於蘇聯方面所傳播的消息，即所謂中日媾和運動的「試探汽球」重張之時，指爲美國政府主動其事，業予剴切吾認。原來中日戰爭影響整個世局，夙爲舉世所關心而注自；茲値太平洋波濤洶湧，中國正期待並接受美國繼續其大量的援助，假使美政府對中日兩國眞是發動排解，則中國國民政府雖未必遽爾動搖了作戰到日軍全撤的信念，然美政府的意態自必爲世人所刮目相看；故赫爾氏所吾認者，正是世人所欲聞。其實美國態度鮮明堅定，認識日本，不信任日本，屢由美政府當局加以毫不客氣的指摘，無所忌憚的斥責；決小會主動的向日本謀取妥協，曾何待赫氏吾認；謠言遍傳，何難覷破其虛妄？祗是謠言，不成爲所謂政治性質的問題。</p>
<p>在中美兩國不成爲問題者，在日本確是當前的唯一問題。決非厚誣，但證以：日本自歷任內閣總理，外務大臣，海陸軍閥，乃至於各有關衙署的發言人，聲明亟求解決所謂中國事變者，無慮千百决，可見其爲問題之至急至大至嚴重。因此之故，日方提示條件，申請排解云云，無論透露之於何種方式之下，無論既有了若十决透露，若干次喧傳，若干决吾認的經驗，但每次皆爲世人所視爲其來有自，決非意外；雖如是經驗者再千百次，世人猶必千百次作如是觀。蓋在日本，眞是問題；而五天之前的試探汽球，遂悠悠然飛越了全球。當汽球悠然之際，亦頗有人疑信參半而日這一决和平空氣究竟如何？這次試探的結果，可謂反應黯淡；衡之預期的反應，可謂結果惡劣。汽球吹破了。而昨日東京電訉，日本當局却亦出之以譏誚的口吻，從而吾認之；謂若就過去之美國對日態度而言，日本何至向美國提出此項建議。這又何必，指此譏誚爲解嘲；這又何必，指明過去之美國對日態度雖若此，往後之態度猶必若此；指明日本希望歡迎松岡遊美，亦即希望對美國獲得妥協與所謂諒解，這一態度，在日本過去未遠，或且還未過去。然而昨日東京電訉所稱日方吾認，必屬不訛；至少，這一次又吾認了。</p>
<p>透露，喧傳，吾認，至再至三乃至千百决，使聞者見者每决覺得來無跡，去無蹤，不明不白，迷迷茫茫；如此不憚煩勞的試探，却是何爲而使然？無他，祇因爲問題至急至大至嚴重，而其性質則「太政治」了，聞者見者，莫爲所眩，莫爲所欺；要知道吾認雖不問如何的正式，不問如何的負責，然不問如何方式的透露與喧傳，則是一律非正式的，是一律不負責的。故試探徒見其窮極無聊，情不自禁，而亦僅止於試探；不惟試探的反應絕非他所把握得，即試探的本體亦非他所主宰得。這决試探的時候，陪襯了一派主張媾和，一派主張續戰的消息，可見性質的「太政治」，問題的無主宰！覷破了無主宰的這一點，凡百試探皆不値加以注意，更遑論計議實行撒軍謀和的大計！</p>
<p>發動侵略與放棄侵略，是政策的絕大轉變。平心而論：在任何國家任何政策的轉變時期，內部發生正反兩面的絕異主張，這是過渡的現象，政治的常情，不足爲奇，不足爲怪，故日本目前有上述兩派的對立，亦不足爲日本恥，不足爲日本譏。確有種種證據，種種理由，可以斷言日本現任內閣總理近衛首相雖於侵華具有繫鈴解鈴的抱負，然而已經完全失敗，喪失其主宰過渡的可能了。可以斷言於終近衛之任，必不能解決所謂中國事變。覷破了這一點，可知關於中日戰爭，日方今後的可能的最重要消息，不是千百次的如何謀和，如何決戰，而是再一决的近衛下臺，內閣改組。</p>

<h3 id="c45">港米售價極爲合理　工部局決不牟利　由港運滬各費頗爲浩鉅　批發商利潤亦並不豐厚　已經售完港米各米號不應朦混懸牌塞責 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>據工部局發表、本局頃據報告、外界對於本局洋米之售價一層、加以淺膚之批評、此殆由於將杳港與上海兩地之另售價格比較而起、</p>
<p>查杳港另售價格、目下等於上海幣制每石八十八元之數、此數應加上港地運費水脚·保險費·兵險費·本埠起卸與上棧費用·海關碼頭捐火險費·利息·以及斤量虧耗等等、故本局洋米之另售價格定爲每石一百十元者、對於批發商人與另售米店、僅予以一極爲合理之營業利潤而已、同時、本局並不牟利、其所可獲得之貨價餘額、爲數渺小、用以應付關於運米之各種開支、</p>
<p>倘因滙價變動而獲得意外之利益、則此種利益、將用以抵補同樣之意外損失、或用以達成本局穩定米市之初衷、使米價站在可能的最低水準也、</p>
<p>港米已到　十萬餘包</p>
<p>工部局爲調劑民食、抑平米價、先後向杳港方面採辦廉價洋米來滬、委託全市各米行號代爲出售、據悉、此項港米到滬之總數、連同昨日下午由泰生輸運來之一萬包在內、共計爲十萬一千六百零九包、由祥茂洋行經手批售與雜糧行者、爲七萬餘包、直接分由各米號在門市零售者、計三萬餘包、所有一切發售手續、均巳辦竣、至於第三批運滬洋米、已交由怡和公司之富生輸及太古公司之蘇州輪裝載來滬、今明日內當可到埠、</p>
<p>團體工廠　購置辦法</p>
<p>自工部局取消限制購買港米之數量、並准各團體工廠訂購後、髒買者頗爲衆多、因此有一部份米號、港米巳銷售一空、現已續向立基洋行中請訂購、至團體工廠購買此項港米之辦法、據悉、如僅購買少量者、可向各米號直接訂購、若數量過多者、則必須辦理申請手續、經該行調查確實自行食用者、方司核准、並命各米號如數售給、聞連日申請者甚多、經調查後多　核准、</p>
<p>售罄米號　勿再懸牌</p>
<p>不肖米商攙雜出售港米、企圖破壞當局計劃、殊令人髮指、但若輩竟猶飾詞、昨曾向公會籲請、要求代爲更正、該會即加以拒絕、局方於日前發給數百小袋平價米米樣、分發各捕房探捕、悉心調查、據悉不肖之徒、均係用</p>
<p>西貢碎米攙入平價港米中、而毀損港米成色、昨又定製西貢碎米米樣數百小袋、分發各捕房探捕、隨時偵查、以杜奸商巧施技倆、又據祥茂洋行負責人語平明社記者稱、木埠各米號、如將其訂購之平價港米售罄時、即須速向立基祥茂兩洋行或工部局指定之泰潤等十七家雜糧行</p>
<p>繼續訂購不能用他種米糧充售、以免再蹈永昌米號之覆轍、查永昌米號、受停止小售工部局洋米權利之處分後、昨日上午、該米號主趙俊蓀、即親往祥茂洋行解釋、據稱、該號因巳將工部局洋米售罄、故將他種洋米售與市民云云、但西捕則認爲該店中旣已無工部局洋米出售、則</p>
<p>不應懸掛「本店出售工部局洋米」之木牌、故認該號有朦混嫌疑、聞祥茂洋行已將此事經過詳情、呈報當局靜候處斷、又據法租界賈西義路二二五號施長義米號范樹九昨函稱、報載因攙雜出售港米、被吊銷執照一節、實無其事、</p>
<p>小車運米　應加注意</p>
<p>前日下午三時許、善鐘路捕房基號華捕、在值崗時瞥見有小車一輛、儎有食米六包、乃上前查訊、始知係白爾路望志路口義和米號所送、惟因該項食米、係公董局廉價平米、依例不得車送如許之多、當連同車輛、一併帶返捕房、經予沒收、並予嚴懲、</p>

<p>亦因戰事影醫，大不如前。而物價則以投機囤積之故，瘋在的飛漲上去；尤其是米煤，消費量不變，而價格比以前漲起十倍餘，以有固定性的經費　入，應付變動不居上漲不絕的物價支小，頓使三百六十八名孤兒日用生活所需，發生絕嚴重的困難。不說　的　單就食米一項來說，每　需米二石半，以一百元一石論，每大即需三百五十元，一月即需一萬零五百元，一年即需十二萬六千元，再加燃料水電菜蔬鞋襪衣着零用，那一樣說是可少，件件皆須由院供給，試想一年支小擴張，收入减少，在這一種人不敷出狀態下，主持者苦心毅力的支持，實在令人欽佩到萬分。</p>
<p>然而，我想，上海社會人士的樂善好施，却也不少；不看新普育堂經費竭　到極點，經本報不斷爲之呼籲，獲得社會上絕大同情，得淸甚大的收穫，據設所收到各方面的捐款，將近十萬兀之數。以土山灣孤兒院八十六年的歷史，內中有最完美的設備，留養孤兒已達五千五百餘名之衆。加以天主敎士不重宣傳，只知工作，眞所謂名副其實的實幹。又爲了平時可以自給自足，不向社會募捐，而社會人士亦漠然置之。如今爲了戰事不絕，漸已感覺到拮据地步，使這一座孤兒的樂園，得以度此難關，步人康莊，這不是孤兒院主持諸君及天主敎徒之責，乃是全社會人士人人應有之責，因共敎養孤兒，不盡是爲天主敎而服務，亦是爲全社會而服務，所以維持的責任，也應由全　會共同夫擔負。</p>
<p>事實如此，不容抹殺，他們的工藝品，正希望社會人士去參觀，而且可以接受各式各樣的日用器具及美術上工藝上爲外界所不能承辦的一切製品，大衆試想，這亦是孤兒院辦理最有成績的一種表示。</p>
<p>我們參觀了出來，離了孤兒院，與志堯先生一路同車回來，記着張神父所寫給我們看的，是該院最誠懇的一句法文呼號，原文是：</p>
<p>Tout　ctient　est　unbienfaiteur　de　I'orphelinat</p>
<p>我雖讀過一年的法文，可是三十年前事，早已還之於趙志游先生了？如今我祇記得這一句中文譯義是：</p>
<p>「凡髒孤兒出品的，就是孤兒的恩人！」</p>
<p>我想這最便利不過的救濟了！買物可以救濟人，上海有錢的人多，眞是惠而不費的事情。何况孤兒院的出品，不以營利爲目的，而以信譽相擔保，眞當得起「貨眞價實」四字，又何樂而不爲？（稿費移助慈雲小學）</p>

<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後氣勢轉平、檯　續疲、首盤價爲一千四白三十五元、機升至一千四百三十六元、但此盤一開、賣者紛至沓來、跌至一千四百十五元、繼以盈利者補空、又復回好　一千四百二十三元、迨至十一點半以後、聞現紗交易不旺、及外匯趨鬆、標金下降、人氣突虛、賣風在起、直下至一千四百零二元、此時賣聲振天、惟有一部份乘虛拖進、又復回好至一千叫百十元收盤、半日問成交統計一萬七千零五十包、內香港幫辦五十包、同行佔一萬七千包、</p>

<p>現棉交易仍岑寂、但人氣尚鎭定、不過廠方需要仍擯持而勿動、然外棉趨勢堅昂、所以情熊尙堪維持、太倉花價爲二百十五元、</p>
<p>洋行外棉交易、良以國際情勢變幻莫測、同時現紗情形逐步趨跌、因之不諭中外商紗廠皆無採　意向、昨日除同業轉售巴西棉三百包、售價四百零六元外、其餘未之聞也、</p>
<p>印棉由港轉運來滬、上海至印度航綫、肉歐戰擴張後、大英公司各輸被海軍部徵發、致船隻缺乏、遂之停航、惟香港印度間仍繼續行駛、故印度棉花不能直接　滬、祇能由孟買或喀爾喀搭運至香港、然後轉運來滬、怡和洋行泰生輪、由港裝來印棉八百七十九件、昨日下午到埠、停羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>紐約棉市頗屬活潑而堅昂、因有同業買進、及華盛頓再度凍結、政府貸款而漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲八磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市，先因空頭抵補及歐州出口商買進而漲、續後又因投機者售出、及多頭了結而回跌、昨日收盤價格、漲跌一羅比左右不等、又預測今日開盤市况看小一羅比、</p>

<p>廠布昨市趨勢暗淡、售盤續見下瀉、乃因賣氣濃重、買戶束手、結果白貨細布斜紋每疋跌五角至七角半、粗布跌二角半之譜、漂染布無正式行市做開、價甚混亂、本街成交各布二百餘件、同業乘廉略見吸收、客銷呆滯、煙臺幫辦組布色布等一百餘件、粵　南洋幫辦粗布斜漂染印花布三百餘件、今有疋頭五百十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布因實銷呆疲如故、業內外賣風特盛、跌勢甚劇、白貨龍頭細布期貨每疋猛跌一元五六角、廠單跌一元左右、下午收市價爲四十五元八角、色貨四君子嗶嘰廠單每碼跌三分半、收盤價一元四角、</p>

<p>烟屑行情、邇來雖步見下降、但下檔貨大批在途、絡續湧到、昨日某號又由內地裝來龍潭屑三千噸、業巳抵埠、適當回疲時間、不得不削價傾銷、同業行拆、碼頭貨每噸開價一百十元、但在此淡銷時節、高貨不動、次檔自亦難能爲力、故成　寥寥、無人問津、</p>

<p>黑鐵坯子日前因銷　滯、現貨多、市勢呆鈍、近來有本街製坯廠印鐵廠機器廠家等起而採辦、漸見轉機、同業心思又堅、開價回升、昨每紮喊價須三千三百元、較前的漲起四五十元不等、全市成交者約三四十捆光景、</p>

<p>戶部議復云：</p>
<p>「中國通商銀行，由部借撥官軟一百萬兩，按年生息。……現在各處分行，開辦伊始，遽令各省關凡解存官款，統交　行收存滙解，無　人不相信，未便强以所難，亦恐跡近把持，於市面商情多所窒　。惟是各省關存解官款，若爲原奏所稱，專交私家銀號，絕不與銀行相涉，則是公家所開之銀行，公家先不相信，又安望商民之共信，殊非國家所以維持銀行振與商務之意。……擬飭各省嗣後凡有通商銀行之處，各項官款滙解，如查明改交通商銀行仍不至受虧，滙費當可輕减者，即均交通商銀行安愼辦理。」</p>
<p>從兩段文字中，須注意者，（一）所調「中國銀行」，乃與「西國銀行」一種對待之稱，蓋謂係中國人開辦之銀行，非若今之中國銀行，以中國爲其行名之謂也。（一）按盛宜懷之任鐵路總辦，係在光緒廿二年八月之後，而盛宜懷之條陳，又在其後，故中國通商銀行之發動，爲光緒廿二年，開辦則在光緒廿三年四月，而以廿二年開辦者誤。（三）按通商銀行，爲其時通行之一名詞，如光緒廿四年四月，盛京將軍伊克唐阿請發紙幣疏中，亦　及發鈔　歸於銀行，並有「各處口岸，則由關道籌款設立通商銀行」，足見當時之欲開辦銀行，爲通商關係，故盛　以此名其行。（四）戶部議復，不願將省關官款存解，交由通商銀行辦理，即爲後來設立戶部銀行之張本。</p>
<p>至通商銀行之發鈔，亦見於戶部議復盛京將軍依克唐阿請發楮幣疏中，其言曰：</p>
<p>「光緒二十二年京師盛宣懷請先在京師上海設立中國銀行，各省會口岸設立分行，由商董自行經理，並印造銀票與現銀相輔血行，會責成招集股本合力興辦，並賞給官款一百萬兩，以爲之倡，現請飭盛宣懷查明上海銀行開設以來所擬足以挽回利權，切實復奏，再行酌奪。」　（未完）</p>

<p>四·圖畫的理論</p>
<p>中西繪畫的學習方法、旣有不同、理論上大有差異、現在再分別的說明、使學習繪畫的同志、得到進一步的研究、中國畫的理論、非常玄妙、立論很多、其中最有力量而乾脆的、就算南齊時候謝赫的六法了、一曰氣韻生動、二曰骨法用筆、三曰應物象形、四曰隨類敷彩、五曰經營位置、六曰傳移摹寫、第一項的氣韻生動、是屬於精神的、因爲繪畫沒有精神、等於人類動物失了生命、不能生活一樣、第二項的骨法用筆、就是用筆的綫條問題、用以描寫湊合的、在中國繪畫上也是非常重要的原子、第三項的應物象形、就是勾勒物體的輸廓、不過、此地的勾勒輪廓、不比西洋畫的純粹在意明暗、遠近透視的、大都略了攝取對象的概狀、很有伸縮改造的餘地、第四項隨類敷彩、就是設色的問題、中國繪畫的設色、並不是重要問題、有很多的畫、只用水墨來表現、絕不借車色彩的點染、別具神情、在單純的墨色中、分出深深淡淡的顏色來、所謂「墨分五色」、第五項經營位置、就是章法了、章法在中國繪畫中佔有十分重要的地位、中國畫雖然也應用「應物象形」的寫生方法、但在畫面上的章法配合、須有充分的變化、周詳的策劃、所謂「成竹在胸」、多一筆太多、少一筆太少、非常的微妙、使畫面達於最美的境界、第六項的傳移摹寫、就是摹臨巳成的繪畫作品、中國畫旣要從臨摹人手、前面巳經講過、假使沒有經過相當的臨摹、是不能從事中國繪畫的、尤其是古人的名作、非臨不可、但是、也不可一味死臨、死臨非但得不到好處、而目養成懶惰、缺少創造能力的、一般人對於中國繪晝往往抱有懷疑、我們從道六法上研究、就可瞭然於胸、</p>

<p>— 堅</p>
<p>「老爺，太太，下來吃飯。」</p>
<p>「少爺，小姐，下來吃飯。」</p>
<p>老娘姨使勁的在樓下喚着。</p>
<p>在上面的人聽見了這四聲都慢吞吞的走下樓去。</p>
<p>十歲的小弟弟第一個竄下去很快的就回上來了。</p>
<p>「弟弟爲什麼又上來了，快下去吃飯。」二姊攔住他叫他下去。</p>
<p>「我不耍吃，一隻好的菜也沒有。」弟弟嘟着嘴向房間裏走。</p>
<p>「不許，今天一定要下去吃，每天讓你點了一隻菜，今天忘了買號不吃飯嗎？」父親嚴厲地</p>
<p>弟弟祇好下去了，桌子上碗內的蝦·魚·肉絲都不合他的胃口。每天他一定要有一塊塊的排骨才吃得下飯；還有他有一個怪脾氣，蝦魚肉一定得淸燒，放進了一些菜葉子或別的東西那就不行了，他會連整碗的東西都不要吃。</p>
<p>「快些吃飯，要不吃以後什麼都不買給你吃了。」父親今天特別兇也不知爲了什麼。</p>
<p>弟弟拿起筷，淚水一點一點滴下來滴在飯碗裏。可是倔强的他，一隻菜餚也不揀，一口一口的把白飯往口裏塞，二分鐘不到就走下桌子算是吃好了。</p>
<p>「怎麼，媽還不下來吃飯，」三妹忽然發覺媽沒有下來這樣嚷起來，她派娘姨上樓去請。</p>
<p>「太太說今天肚子有些不舒服，不要吃飯，她等一會買麵吃好了！」娘姨這樣下來回報。</p>
<p>「二姊，我分一點飯給你好嗎？」十妹剛從大三。回來，肚子裏簡直裝小進一粒飯了，可是又怕爸說，所以祗能勉强的來裝裝　子。</p>
<p>「我自己也吃不下，今天點心吃得太多了，你還是分給大姊吧！」</p>
<p>「不要你瞎介紹，我們今天學校裏開茶話會，糖果點心肚子裝飽了。」大姊趕快的說了一大堆理由。</p>
<p>「小姐，吃小下飯，剩下來，等一會兒可以給阿花吃」聰明的阿金解決了這米飯過多的「恐慌。」</p>
<p>「以後少吃點心，米價這樣貴，你們還要老嚷着吃不下去，你們想想馬路上的乞丐肚子餓了沒有飯吃，那才會滿足呢？」又是爸爸的聲昔。</p>
<p>其實他自己每大差不多都在外面吃飯，請客帖子老是不斷的來，「金門」「國際飯店」「美華」……，他自己告訴我們說：這些菜餚他都吃厭了，他倒喜歡在家裏點一　隻靑菜豆腐吃。</p>
<p>「爸爸我們又不是每天都吃不下飯的，你目己難得在家裏吃一頓飯，止巧我們今天都吃飽了點心。」三妹俏皮的說着。</p>
<p>爸爸也不響什麼了。可是以後每天吃飯的時候，還是老樣子，還是大家嚷着，「吃不下飯！」</p>
<p>什麼米價漲了跌了，什麼投機家操縱　積，這些我們這家庭裏的人是全不顧問的。</p>
<p>馬路上看見　三搶米，給巡捕抓住了痛打。</p>
<p>「唉！年靑的人不做工，卻在搶米，眞是活該」三姐感嘆似的說。</p>
<p>街上排列艦一長條衣衫襤褸的人羣，老的，小的，中年的都爭先恐後的不知在幹些什麼。</p>
<p>「大姊，這些人幹什麼的。」小弟弟詫異地問</p>
<p>他們是搶着買碎米的」大姊平淡地回答着。</p>
<p>「碎米也可以吃嗎？」小弟弟更覺奇怪了。</p>
<p>「像你有了白飯不吃，一定要揀排骨，這些窮人連碎米也買不到呢！」</p>
<p>小弟弟雖然不響了，可是他心中想着；他們怎麼可以跟我們比呢，我爸爸每大有錢賺回來的，他們是窮人，我們是富人呀！弟弟腦子一轉，忽然又想到了一句：</p>
<p>「大姊：你不用說我，你們不是也每天嚷着「吃不下飯」嗎？」</p>

<p>宗先生現出憔悴的苦險，呆坐在大沙發上，窗外嘈離得很。他仍然保持他的靜穆。</p>
<p>宗太太，着上初夏的新裝，飄襲然踱進臥室，雖然她的皮鞋聲，是那樣的響亮，可是並不能改變宗先生的態度。</p>
<p>宗太太看見她丈夫的態度失常，詫異起來。「甚麼！又不開心了嗎？誰惹怒了你！」</p>
<p>宗先生放出他慘黯的目光，在他的妻子身上，旋轉了一回，仍然靜默着。</p>
<p>宗太太愈加奇怪，但又沒有方法去引起她丈夫底與致，她沒精打彩地脫去了她的春裝，除去了她的皮鞋。</p>
<p>室內肅靜無聲，祇有「的達」「的達」的鐘聲，來消除雙方的隔膜。</p>
<p>「晚飯吃過了嗎？」宗太太淸脆的發問。</p>
<p>「沒有吃呢！」宗先生輕輕地。</p>

<p>但是在歌舞昇的此地，舞廳鬥首却掛着「武裝兵士概不招待」的牌子。同是一種享樂的形式，但却包含着兩種不同的內容。（Uniform　unwelcome）。</p>

<p>壽星非神，非佛，非鬼，壽星是人。</p>

<p>壽星本來叫王八。</p>
<p>打什麼時候被喚起說不淸了。在什麼地方喚起也記不淸了。好像王八生出來就該做壽星似地；壽星不出，奈蒼生何？</p>
<p>雖然，有時候高與起來對着鏡子「瞻仰」那麼一會兒：額角長得像洗衣裳板于，加上三角眼，鷹爪鼻，獅子口，可又一點兒也……但壽星總究是壽命，「天經地義」的！</p>
<p>王八，不！壽星今年高壽，不多不少，剛剛四十多歲。正介乎老「幼」之間焉；所以「老吾老以及人之老；幼吾幼以及人之幼」，全對勁兒！</p>

<p>可是人家莫明其妙。</p>
<p>於是，他哭到這邊，跳到那邊；假使你吃飽了飯沒事做去勸，他便會當你就是五百萬市民的「代表」；大駡一頓，「敎訓」一通，搖頭嘆氣而去也。</p>

<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>在影城好萊塢，可以說各色人等都有，形形色色的產生了許多有趣的新聞。那裏也有靠幾句江湖訣混飯喫的算命先生，因爲女明星中有很多是相信迷信的，所以那班算命先生生意倒也興隆。</p>
<p>最近有一個星相家安塞爾，他發表了一點關於女明星合婚的種種，猶如「喬太守亂點鴛鴦譜。」亂七八糟得好玩，他以爲「紅花艷曲」，「仙樂街」的女主角蓓蒂葛萊寶（最近當選爲好萊塢「體態最佳」之女明星）是天月星，做事總猶豫不決的，應該嫁給像泰羅鮑華那樣的人。但不知他把安娜蓓拉怎樣處置？（蓓蒂葛萊寶的前夫是十年前的紅童星今已隱退的賈克哥根。）</p>
<p>他以爲去年新從百老滙重返影壇的「舊歡新寵」的女主角凱塞玲赫本，應該嫁給一個像音樂家史篤考夫斯基那樣的人，凱塞玲赫本在好萊塢是被人認爲「神秘女星」的，她的婚姻直到現在還始終沒有個歸宿，按史驚考夫斯基現在年紀已經很老了，凱塞玲赫本祇够得上做他的女兒的年齡，你想這個推算荒唐不荒唐？</p>
<p>他還說了許多奇特的話，如琴逑　吉絲應嫁唐亞曼契，露珊玲羅賽兒應嫁愛德華羅濱遜，蓓蒂台維絲應嫁勞倫斯奧立佛，露茜鮑兒應嫁「淸平樂」主角小提琴專家傑夏海菲茨，狄安娜竇萍應嫁亨利方達，但在事實上有幾個還是新婚不久的，如狄安娜竇萍與馮保羅，蓓蒂台維絲與亞瑟凡恩斯華士，而有幾個　經是子女成羣的了呢。</p>

<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated that the Chinese forces in the Zhongtiao Mountains and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi are still holding firm. Troops defending the northern front have shifted their positions to more advantageous locations. The spokesperson announced that the Japanese army only maintains a small garrison at the Yellow River crossing, while the main force has moved north towards the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army is also consolidating its positions along the Jiyuan-Yuanqu highway, but Chinese forces have attacked the road from both the north and south. The spokesperson also stated, "I strongly suspect that the Japanese army destroyed the Chinese army's positions in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Zaoyang, in northern Hubei, 142 miles northwest of Hankou, has been captured and lost three times since it was occupied by the Japanese army on May 12. As a result, the Chinese army recaptured the area on May 16. The Japanese army has now retreated to its original positions." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to an official report released by the Chinese side last night, the Chinese army recaptured Zhuji, a strategic military location in Zhejiang province, on Tuesday, killing 4,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army has retreated north. Zhuji was the main concentration point for Japanese troops recently occupied. The official report also announced that since May 9, the Japanese army has transferred more than 10,000 soldiers from various towns east of Huizhou to Bowie and Huizhou. The Japanese army is now surrounded in Huizhou and Boluo. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: According to telephone reports from the front lines, there are still occasional artillery battles from the foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains to the Yellow River coast. The Japanese army's attempt to cross the Zi River from the north bank a week ago has not been seen recently, which proves that the strong posture of the Chinese army is gradually stabilizing. According to observations from responsible parties, although the battle situation in the Zhongtiao Mountains is still tense, the Chinese side is indeed increasingly confident in its victory.

<p>Shaoguan: (1) On the 18th, the Chinese army recaptured Hengli, and the Japanese army was defeated and retreated towards Shuikou. The Chinese army is currently pursuing and attacking the rear. The city of Huizhou is now surrounded by Chinese forces, and there is no trace of the Japanese. (2) Many Japanese soldiers on the Guangshan and Guangjiu lines have recently contracted the plague, with more than a thousand Japanese corpses being transported back to Guangzhou's Henan Shitou for cremation. (3) On the 17th, two Japanese warships sailed from Hebao Island to the Guanghai sea area and fired several shells at the shore, all of which landed on the riverbank, destroying several civilian boats.

<p>Chongqing: Sixty-eight Japanese planes attacked Sichuan today in four groups. The first and third groups, with ten planes each, strafed with machine guns after reaching the vicinity of Chengdu. The second group of twenty-six planes, including twenty-seven, dropped bombs in Chengdu, Suining and other places.

Eighty-one Japanese planes dropped four hundred bombs on Chengdu, causing a major fire in the city center and damaging property. It is not yet reported whether any Japanese planes were shot down in the aerial battles in Chengdu and Liangshan. Yesterday, forty-seven Japanese bombers took off from Yuncheng and bombed various cities in Gansu and Shaanxi. Lanzhou, the provincial capital of Gansu, and the northwest of Xi'an were bombed.

<p>Chongqing: Hu De, a pilot for the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), told a United Press reporter last night that he did not believe Japanese warplanes forced a CNAC plane to land in Xufu on Tuesday afternoon and strafed it with machine guns. He pointed out that the Japanese planes only bombed the CNAC passenger plane with bombs when it was parked at Xufu Airport. Mr. Hu told a United Press reporter when he arrived at Chongqing Airport last night, "There was no machine gun fire. When we landed in Xufu, we heard that Japanese planes were very close, so we didn't have time to take off. The passengers and crew left the plane and took cover. When the Japanese planes arrived overhead, everyone was safely in their hiding places. Afterwards, the Japanese planes dropped many bombs, one of which destroyed the plane's right wing. The engine and other parts of the plane were not damaged, and only a few places were pierced by shrapnel, but it did not affect anything. The main damage was that large pieces of mud fell on the wings. There were no casualties among the passengers, and all the passengers transferred to Chengdu without incident." It is understood that one of the crew members started repairing the plane yesterday, and the plane may have already flown out. Hu De has been in China since 1933 and is very famous in China. In 1938, he was piloting a Douglas DCZ "Guilin" when it was shot down by Japanese planes in Guangdong. Several passengers were killed and injured at that time, and Mr. Hu was also injured. Mr. Hu joked to the United Press reporter, "I don't understand why this kind of thing always happens to my planes." Mr. Hu took a vacation in the United States last year and flew an American plane to England. Mr. and Mrs. Bai Lang, who were passengers on the plane, arrived in Chengdu yesterday.

<h3 id="e8">Japan in the Question of Peace and War <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>All political issues, whether national or international, are often more ambiguous, different in appearance and reality, complex in form, and intertwined with fact and fiction than other types of issues. Listeners and viewers often cannot understand them clearly from the beginning, and may even end up feeling confused. However, there are often cases where one only needs to focus on one point to see through everything that seems mysterious.</p>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, US Secretary of State Hull, regarding the news spread by the Soviet Union, that is, the "trial balloon" of the Sino-Japanese peace movement, which was falsely claimed as initiated by the US government, gave a clear denial. Originally, the Sino-Japanese war affects the entire world situation and has long been a matter of concern and attention to the world. Now, at a time when the Pacific Ocean is turbulent and China is expecting and receiving large-scale assistance from the United States, if the US government really launches a reconciliation between China and Japan, the Chinese National Government may not immediately waver in its belief to fight until the Japanese army completely withdraws. However, the attitude of the US government will inevitably attract the attention of the world. Therefore, what Mr. Hull denied is exactly what the world wants to hear. In fact, the US attitude is clear and firm, recognizing Japan and distrusting Japan, and has repeatedly been subjected to unceremonious accusations and uninhibited reprimands by the US government authorities. It will never take the initiative to seek compromise with Japan. Why would there be a need for Mr. Hull's denial? Rumors spread everywhere, and it is not difficult to see through their falsity. It's just a rumor, not a so-called political issue.</p>
<p>What is not a problem between the United States and China is indeed the only current problem in Japan. It is by no means a malicious accusation. But it can be proven by the fact that Japanese prime ministers, foreign ministers, military warlords, and even spokespersons of various relevant government departments have declared that they are eager to resolve the so-called China Incident countless times. This shows that it is an extremely urgent, large, and serious problem. Therefore, whether the Japanese side proposes conditions or applies for reconciliation, no matter under what form it is revealed, no matter how many times it has been revealed, how many times it has been publicized, or how many times it has been denied, each time it is seen by the world as having its origin and not being unexpected. Even if such experiences happen thousands of times again, the world will still view it in the same way thousands of times. Because in Japan, it is really a problem. And the trial balloon five days ago floated leisurely across the globe. When the balloon was floating leisurely, some people were half-doubting and half-believing, saying, "What will this round of peace atmosphere be like?" The result of this trial can be said to be a dim reaction. Measured against the expected reaction, the result can be said to be bad. The balloon burst. And yesterday's Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese authorities also came out with a mocking tone to deny it, saying that given the past attitude of the United States towards Japan, why would Japan make this proposal to the United States? Why bother to point out that this ridicule is a way to excuse oneself? Why bother to clarify that although the past attitude of the United States towards Japan was like this, the future attitude will still be like this? To clarify that Japan hopes to welcome Matsuoka's visit to the United States, that is, hopes to reach a compromise and so-called understanding with the United States. This attitude has not been far in Japan's past, or may not have passed yet. However, yesterday's Tokyo dispatch claiming the Japanese side's denial must be true. At least, it has been denied again this time.</p>
<p>Revealing, publicizing, and denying, again and again, even thousands of times, make listeners and viewers feel that they come without a trace and go without a trace, unclear and confusing. Such tireless trials are made for what? There is no other reason, only because the problem is extremely urgent, large, and serious, and its nature is "too political." Listeners and viewers, do not be dazzled by it, do not be deceived by it. Know that although the denial may be formal, no matter how responsible, the revealing and publicizing in any form are all informal and irresponsible. Therefore, the trial only shows that it is extremely boring and uncontrollable, and it is only a trial. Not only is the reaction of the trial not something it can grasp, but the trial itself is not something it can dominate. At the time of this trial, it was accompanied by a group of messages advocating peace and a group of messages advocating continued war. It can be seen that the nature is "too political" and the problem is without a master! Seeing through this point of no master, all trials are not worth paying attention to, let alone discussing and implementing the major plan of withdrawing troops and seeking peace!</p>
<p>Launching aggression and abandoning aggression are major changes in policy. Objectively speaking, in any country during the transition period of any policy change, the emergence of diametrically opposed views, both positive and negative, is a transitional phenomenon and a political commonplace, and there is nothing strange or surprising about it. Therefore, the current opposition between the above-mentioned two factions in Japan is not something for Japan to be ashamed of or ridiculed. There is indeed all kinds of evidence and reasons to assert that although the current Japanese Prime Minister, Konoe, has the ambition to resolve the China Incident by tying and untying the bell, he has completely failed and lost the possibility of dominating the transition. It can be asserted that during the term of Konoe, he will not be able to resolve the so-called China Incident. Seeing through this point, it can be known that the most important possible news from the Japanese side regarding the Sino-Japanese war in the future is not how to seek peace or how to fight to the death thousands of times, but rather another round of Konoe's resignation and cabinet reshuffle.</p>

The Ta Kung Pao's letter said, "The method of US assistance to China and self-help is to provide China with enough military equipment and money to last for four weeks, and China can defeat Japan." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesperson for the central authorities declined to comment on the Ta Kung Pao's published comments urging the Communist troops. He said that the Ta Kung Pao's comments could only express the newspaper's views and had nothing to do with the views of the military authorities. The above statement was issued because someone had asked the spokesperson whether the comments clearly stated that the Communist Party did not participate in the southern Shanxi war and could be regarded as disobeying orders. Someone also asked whether the highest authorities of the Chinese army had ordered the 18th Route Army to participate in the war. The spokesperson replied that he could not confirm it and needed to return to the office for research. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hart, Continues in Office. <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Navy Secretary Colonel Knox yesterday called for a revision of the "terrible Neutrality Act." Colonel Knox stated that the United States should return to the policy of freedom of the seas so that American merchant ships can sail directly to Britain and other war ports to provide aid to democratic countries. However, he declined to discuss the issue of convoys. He said that it would be "foolish" for us to advocate the adoption of a convoy system based on the effective experience of the last World War. His remarks led observers to believe that a better method than convoys might emerge. It is understood that the authorities are conducting experimental work on this matter. Colonel Knox also stated that the U.S. naval air force is being strengthened and that the Navy hopes to realize its ideal of 19,000 naval aircraft by 1943. The U.S. Navy is studying plans to build small aircraft carriers to cope with the dangers to shipping. Production Management Director Knudsen announced that the government has formally notified Ford, Boeing, Lockheed, and Douglas aircraft factories that the government will soon sign contracts with them to build heavy bombers. This is in accordance with the President's recent plan to build a large number of bombers. Following this announcement, these factories can prepare in advance. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

Knox refused to comment on whether the Far East situation is becoming more serious, nor would he comment on the Navy's plans to continue to retain senior generals who have reached retirement age. When asked if the Navy had any information about the recent collective flight of "Flying Fortress" bombers to Hawaii, Colonel Knox replied that even if he knew, he would not be at liberty to disclose it.

He did state that the raiders are now quieter than before. Coates also stated that U.S.-made bombers have now arrived in New Zealand and began aerial patrols on Monday. It is generally expected that U.S. long-range bombers will patrol the New Zealand seas. Coates and New Zealand Land Minister Langstone are leading a group of eight New Zealanders on the Clipper to Washington. They arrived here last night. Langstone said that he would discuss trade issues with U.S. representatives, while Coates said that he was particularly concerned with military and war needs. Coates said, "I will discuss with allied people and let them know what we need," indicating that New Zealand hopes to receive U.S. aid as stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act. Coates pointed out that New Zealand's greatest contribution to the war is to provide manpower and food, and that the proportion of New Zealanders in the military is greater than any part of the British Empire. He also said that he believes that the New Zealand troops in the last European war were the best army in the world, and that the current New Zealand army is even better than before because its knowledge is more complete and it can adapt to modern warfare. Coates declined to comment on the rumor that New Zealand would send its first ambassador to the United States. Langstone, commenting on New Zealand's role in the war, said that never has a country in the world been so unified in its will and able to create a peace based on goodwill and good neighborliness as New Zealand. We will never be swayed by the threats of dictators. We realize that dictators cannot place every country under military rule, nor can they create a trade system in which all countries contribute to Germany. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

Britain Decides to Defend the Island's Coastline. <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Cairo: The British General Headquarters issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that yesterday, multiple groups of German paratroopers and air legions continued to land in various parts of Crete. British and New Zealand troops, assisted by Greek and Cretan troops, are making every effort to annihilate them. The British army fought bravely, and three counterattacks were very successful. The enemy's losses yesterday were greater than before. By nightfall, the situation in all areas except Maleme was very successful. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: At a meeting of the House of Commons yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Churchill reported on the latest war news from Crete, saying that at 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday, there was continued aerial attack on Suda Bay, with 3,000 paratroopers landing. By 6:30 p.m. that evening, most of the paratroopers had been dealt with. The fighting had not stopped, and by 9:00 p.m. the situation was under control. The German method of attack was to use dive bombers and Messerschmitt fighters first, followed by glider squadrons and paratrooper squads. Paratroopers in the Heraklion and Rethymno areas began their attack at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and transport planes landed. However, many transport planes crashed. It is expected that the fighting will continue to be intense. A member asked that if German soldiers landed wearing British uniforms, how would this be dealt with in accordance with international law? The Prime Minister replied that the enemy soldiers did wear New Zealand uniforms, but in reality, the details of this matter had not been fully reported, so it would have to be handled by the local military authorities at their discretion. A communiqué from the Central Army Headquarters in Cairo on the afternoon of the 21st stated that Crete was subjected to intense aerial attacks throughout the day on Tuesday, and paratroopers and others landed in various places. There was fierce fighting all day, and the enemy suffered heavy losses, while the British suffered relatively minor losses. A German unit even broke into the outskirts of Canea, but was quickly surrounded and dealt with. The fighting is still ongoing. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to military sources here, the two points where German paratroopers first landed on Crete at 1:00 a.m. on May 20th were Suda Bay and Maleme. Suda Bay is one of the most important British naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean after the German invasion of Greece, and Maleme is the site of an important airfield. The Germans sent paratroopers to land after a day of heavy bombing. Shortly after, paratroopers also landed at Canea (the capital of Crete) and Heraklion on the peninsula north of Suda Bay. At 6:30 a.m. on the 20th, the bombing continued unabated, and paratroopers landed again in Heraklion and Rethymno. The fighting continued until night, and the situation was quite chaotic because many paratroopers were wearing New Zealand uniforms. The war situation on the 21st is still unknown. According to responsible parties yesterday, the claim that the enemy navy had landed on Crete is not true, but the Germans had sent small boats to attempt a landing. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London: British bombers have launched extensive attacks on German-occupied airfields in Greece to deter German attacks on Crete. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Alexandria: Egyptian Greek expatriates were very angry to hear the news of the attack on Crete. Greeks and Cretans in Egypt unanimously stated that this action by the Germans strengthened the determination of the Greeks to fight to the end. The capture and killing of paratroopers is clear proof that aggression from the air is bound to fail. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e33">British and Greek Troops on the Island Fight German Paratroopers in Bloody Battles <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London: Determined British and Greek troops, having heard the news, separately engaged in mortal hand-to-hand combat with countless German paratroopers in mountain ridges, valleys, highlands, and beaches this morning in order to save Crete from falling into Nazi hands. Unofficial but extremely reliable sources said that the number of German soldiers landing on Crete, having been dropped by low-flying aircraft arriving in succession, may have exceeded 15,000. The Germans had apparently prepared to sacrifice the majority of their soldiers in order to seize the island, and hoped to frustrate the morale of the British and Greek troops through attacks by large numbers of aircraft and paratroopers, thereby rendering the island indefensible. According to various sources, there are still 40,000 German troops in Greece, preparing to set off to intensify their frenzied blitzkrieg and air invasion. The Germans are apparently extremely determined to drive the British out of Crete, which Prime Minister Churchill has declared he is determined to defend to the death. It is reported that British troops are resisting German troops attempting to land in small boats, and it is reported that these small boats have been driven toward the small bays and remote beaches along the northwest coast of Crete, but authoritative sources have not yet revealed what the outcome will be. The British Navy seems to be using its great power to protect the island's coastline. Military experts doubt whether the Germans can use very large ships to put pressure on the British fleet operating around Crete. However, they pointed out that the Germans have concentrated a number of small boats in the Greek coast and islands, as well as in Rhodes, which may be able to pass through the British naval defenses at night. However, the troops stationed in Crete, led by General Freyberg, have prepared to launch a head-on attack on any enemy troops attempting to land. Naval experts also warned that Hitler may use the Italian navy to assist in a certain maritime invasion, and then follow it up with German troops transported by aircraft. Naval experts believe that the Germans will probably be able to use Italian ships, and may even be able to use amphibious tanks, just as they did when crossing the Meuse River in France. However, they vehemently stated that the Germans have no such intention at this time, and believe that the British Navy will definitely be able to quickly crush this German attempt. They also pointed out that the defenders of the island have prepared to defend the coast and inland with thorough anti-tank methods. What General Freyberg is most anxious about now is that the operational convenience of British fighter planes may be lost, as it is reported that British planes are currently unable to compete with German planes in terms of numbers in terms of driving away German planes, landing soldiers, and bombing Cretan airfields, with a ratio of one to twenty-three compared to German planes. Yesterday, British and Greek troops and German troops were still engaged in a life-and-death "hide-and-seek" battle, while British troops maintained strict vigilance along the coast to prevent soldiers from the sea. As of yesterday afternoon, apart from what authoritative sources in London called a relatively small-scale attempt by German troops, there was no news of German troops landing by sea, and the one section referred to by authoritative sources cannot be considered a formal invasion. Authoritative sources pointed out that the Germans lacked tools other than smaller warships that could be used for an invasion of the Mediterranean. Therefore, their only opportunity to break through the British naval defenses may be to use the Italian fleet, which has recently been stationed in several places, and drive it to battle. As there are currently no official reports, it is generally believed that the Germans will continue their means of Tuesday, that is, using airplanes to transport troops to fight. However, regarding the actual situation in Crete, everything is not very clear except that the war has not yet reached a decisive stage. Officials also admitted that it is difficult to estimate the exact number of Germans landing on Crete, because the landing techniques of the invading troops, especially the paratroopers, are particularly good. The skies over Britain have been very still for more than ten days. People here are now speculating whether the Germans have now temporarily suspended their long-term threat of a major assault on London, and whether the bomber groups now stationed on the northern border of France will cross the Mediterranean and launch a large-scale assault on Suez.

<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declined to disclose the situation of the war on Crete, only citing British reports and saying that the situation is becoming more serious. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy: Although the war report released by the German High Command today regarding the war on Crete did not mention a single word, in reality, large-scale warfare has been taking place on the island since yesterday morning. According to reports from London, seventy German soldiers have landed on the island by parachute. This move is one of the most important parts of the Axis military plan, and it is expected that attacks will gradually unfold in other areas at the same time. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to reports from London, the British public is watching the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that the war in the Near East may also occur in the British mainland. Therefore, the British mainland has increased anti-aircraft guns. The British public believes that the war on Crete is a major battle in the current European war, and its implications are very significant. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Times of London reported that if Crete falls into the hands of the enemy, the enemy will control the key to attacking Egypt, and the activities of the British Navy in the eastern Mediterranean will also be hindered. The Germans will launch a fierce attack on the island, and German planes flying to the island are closer than British planes taking off from Egypt, Cyprus, or Palestine. The German attack on the island may be carried out entirely by the air force, or may seize landing points along the coast at night. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Six Greek cabinet members fled to Cairo before German planes bombed Crete. Well-informed sources in London confirmed this report yesterday. The British government tried to keep it secret, fearing that the news of the Greek cabinet members fleeing to Cairo would have a negative impact on British public opinion. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Vichy Imitates Nazis: Adopts Scuttling Policy; Shipping Department Orders All Captains to Scuttle; France Currently Has 1.5 Million Tons of Merchant Shipping <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London: The Vichy government has imitated the Nazis and adopted a policy of scuttling ships. The Vichy shipping department has ordered all French ship captains to scuttle or destroy their ships if necessary to prevent them from being captured by the British authorities. This order was signed by Auphan, representing Darlan, and recently obtained by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. It stated that failure to comply with this order would result in severe consequences for existing French transportation permits, and the captains themselves would be punished. According to responsible sources in London, the reference to permits indicates that French ships now require the permission of the Armistice Commission to sail. In fact, all French merchant ships have been chartered by the Germans. All orders issued to French merchant ships must be submitted to the Armistice Commission, so the movements of French merchant ships are controlled by the commission. In February, Vichy broadcast that it was estimated that France had a total of 2.5 million tons of merchant shipping at the time of the armistice. The British have detained 190 French ships, totaling 450,000 tons. French ships under the command of General de Gaulle total 43,000 tons. Another 57,000 tons of merchant shipping have been reported lost. At the time of the armistice, 250,000 tons of French ships were confiscated or detained by the Germans, and 170,000 tons were detained in neutral ports. From this, it can be seen that France currently has about 1.5 million tons of merchant shipping. There have been no reports of French ships being scuttled. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Hong Kong Rice Price Extremely Reasonable; Municipal Council Does Not Profit; Various Costs of Shipping from Hong Kong to Shanghai Are Very High; Wholesale Merchants' Profit Margins Are Not High Either; Rice Shops That Have Sold All Their Hong Kong Rice Should Not Deceive Customers by Leaving Up Signs <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council has received reports of superficial criticism regarding the selling price of its foreign rice. This is likely due to comparing the retail prices of Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The current retail price in Hong Kong is equivalent to 88 Shanghai currency dollars per stone. This number must be added to shipping fees, freight charges, insurance fees, war risk fees, local unloading and storage fees, customs wharf dues, fire insurance fees, interest, and weight loss. Therefore, the Council's retail price of 110 dollars per stone provides wholesale merchants and retail rice shops with only a very reasonable profit margin. At the same time, the Council does not profit. The remaining balance of the proceeds is minimal and is used to cover various expenses related to rice transportation.</p>
<p>If unexpected profits are gained due to exchange rate fluctuations, these profits will be used to offset similar unexpected losses, or to achieve the Council's original intention of stabilizing the rice market and keeping rice prices at the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 Bags of Hong Kong Rice Have Arrived</p>
<p>To regulate the food supply and suppress rice prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council has procured inexpensive foreign rice from Hong Kong and entrusted various rice shops throughout the city to sell it. It is reported that the total amount of this Hong Kong rice that has arrived in Shanghai, including the 10,000 bags transported by the Taishun yesterday afternoon, is 101,609 bags. Over 70,000 bags were handled by Xiangmao Foreign Company for wholesale to miscellaneous grain stores, and over 30,000 bags were directly retailed by various rice shops. All sales procedures have been completed. As for the third batch of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai, it has been loaded onto the Fusheng of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the Suzhou of Butterfield &amp; Swire, which should arrive in port in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Purchase Methods for Organizations and Factories</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council lifted restrictions on the quantity of Hong Kong rice that can be purchased and allowed various organizations and factories to order it, many are purchasing it. As a result, some rice shops have sold out of Hong Kong rice and are now continuing to apply to Liji Foreign Company for orders. As for the methods for organizations and factories to purchase this Hong Kong rice, it is reported that if only a small quantity is purchased, orders can be placed directly with various rice shops. If the quantity is excessive, then application procedures must be completed, and the application is only approved after the foreign company investigates and confirms that it is for self-consumption. And each rice shop is ordered to sell the rice as requested. It is reported that many applications have been filed in recent days, and most have been approved after investigation.</p>
<p>Do Not Display Signs After Rice Is Sold Out</p>
<p>Dishonest rice merchants are selling mixed rice, attempting to undermine the authorities' plan, which is outrageous. But they even continue to embellish excuses. Yesterday, they appealed to the Rice Merchants' Association, requesting it to correct their behavior, which the association refused. The Bureau distributed hundreds of small bags of low-priced rice samples to various police stations' detectives some time ago to investigate carefully. It is reported that the dishonest merchants are using</p>
<p>Saigon broken rice mixed into the low-priced Hong Kong rice, ruining the quality of the Hong Kong rice. Yesterday, hundreds of small bags of Saigon broken rice samples were made again and distributed to various police stations' detectives for investigation at any time, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from using tricks. According to the person in charge of Xiangmao Foreign Company, he told a Peace Daily reporter that if the various rice shops in the district sell out of their ordered low-priced Hong Kong rice, they must quickly order from Liji, Xiangmao, and the 17 designated miscellaneous grain stores such as Tairun.</p>
<p>They cannot sell other types of rice to fill the order, so as not to repeat the mistake of Yongchang Rice Shop. After Yongchang Rice Shop was punished by being suspended from the right to retail Municipal Council foreign rice, the owner of the rice shop, Zhao Junsun, went to Xiangmao Foreign Company to explain yesterday morning. He claimed that his shop had sold out of Municipal Council foreign rice, so he sold other types of foreign rice to the citizens. However, the Western police officer believes that since the shop no longer has Municipal Council foreign rice for sale, it</p>
<p>should not display a wooden sign stating "This store sells Municipal Council foreign rice". Therefore, it is believed that the shop has a suspicion of deceiving customers. It is reported that Xiangmao Foreign Company has reported the details of the incident to the authorities for judgment. Furthermore, Fan Shujiu of Shichangyi Rice Shop at No. 225 Jiaxiyi Road, French Concession, wrote yesterday stating that the report that he was had his license revoked for selling mixed Hong Kong rice was untrue.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Rickshaws Transporting Rice</p>
<p>Around 3 PM the day before yesterday, a Chinese policeman from the Shanzhong Road police station saw a rickshaw carrying six bags of rice while on duty. He went forward to question the driver and learned that the rice was sent by the Yihe Rice Shop at the intersection of Baer Road and Wangzhi Road. However, since this rice was a low-priced rice of the Municipal Council, it was not allowed to be transported in such large quantities by rickshaw. He immediately brought the rickshaw and the driver back to the police station, confiscated the rice and the rickshaw, and severely punished the driver.</p>

<h3 id="e53">San Francisco Shortwave Radio Station Broadcasts Chinese Programs, Named "China Good Neighbor Time," Shanghai Can Listen at 5 PM <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>According to news from San Francisco, the KGEI shortwave radio station in the Chinatown central district of that city, which was established by General Electric Company, has strong broadcasting power. It now broadcasts special programs to Asia every night, named "China Good Neighbor Time." The program is broadcast exclusively in Mandarin and Cantonese, using accurate world news and the best Chinese opera and music. For special events, such as the Chinese New Year and the Rice Bowl Movement, Chinese reporters bring recording equipment to the liveliest places to broadcast the current events.</p>
<p>Establishing Friendship Among Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>KGEI radio station is the first to broadcast Chinese-language programs from a radio station outside of China. The radio station is located in San Francisco, where the most overseas Chinese live on the North American continent. Therefore, it can add this special program. Its purpose is to establish contact and harmony between overseas Chinese in the United States and overseas Chinese in Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, East India, and Asia.</p>
<p>Extremely Clear Reception in the East</p>
<p>Because the radio station is on the west coast of the United States, only this radio station's broadcast can be clearly heard in the East. Other shortwave radio stations in the United States are all east of the Mississippi River, broadcasting directly to Europe and Latin America. "China Good Neighbor Time" broadcasts programs from midnight to 1:00 AM (Shanghai summer time 5 to 6 PM). The frequency is 9670. The director is Mr. Huang, a Chinese businessman leader in Oakland, California. The technical supervisor is Mr. Tang of the Kingstar Radio Company. The China Six Company and its Director Mr. Feng are also actively cooperating. Mr. Feng recently flew to Chongqing and has just returned to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sent a Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>When the "China Good Neighbor Time" program was broadcast for the first time at midnight on April 19, a grand ceremony was held, and congratulatory telegrams from US President Roosevelt, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and dignitaries from the government and the public were read out. The Chinese Ambassador to the United States entrusted the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco (C.T. Feng) to represent him at the event. Two Chinese singers who recently arrived in the United States also flew from New York to San Francisco to participate in the first broadcast program. The musicians were the Chinese orchestra from the Chinese Theatre in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously established a refugee factory to raise funds. Therefore, the dance hall group asked various dance halls to make slight relief donations from the dancers. Dance halls with dance prices within 1.5 yuan were classified as Class A dance halls, and each dancer donated 10 cents. Dance halls with dance prices above 1.5 yuan were classified as Class B dance halls, and each dancer was charged 5 cents. Since its implementation, it has been two years and three months, with an average monthly income of about 10,000 yuan. In 27 months, 270,000 yuan has been received. This amount will be used as the refugee factory fund, and it will be established as soon as the funds are collected. In April, due to the warm weather, it was very suitable for dancing, so the number of tourists in the dance halls increased sharply, and business was particularly prosperous. The relief donation income also broke past records. In one month, a total of 11,499.7 yuan was received, an increase of about 1,700 to 1,800 yuan compared to previous months.</p>

<p>Also due to the shadow of war, medical treatment is not as good as before. And prices are soaring wildly due to speculation and hoarding; especially rice and coal, consumption remains unchanged, and prices have risen more than ten times compared to before, with fixed funding income, to cope with the ever-changing and rising prices, it suddenly made the daily life of 368 orphans face extremely serious difficulties. Not to mention the single item of rice, each time needing two and a half stones of rice, at 100 yuan per stone, each day needs 350 yuan, each month needs 10,500 yuan, each year needs 126,000 yuan, plus fuel, water, electricity, vegetables, shoes, socks, clothing, and pocket money, which one can be said to be less, each must be provided by the hospital, imagine the annual expenditure expansion, income reduction, under this kind of deficit state, the perseverance and effort of the hosts is really admirable to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, I think that the charitable nature of people in Shanghai society is also not small; without seeing that the funds of the New Universal Nursery have been exhausted to the extreme, and after this newspaper constantly appealed for it, it has gained great sympathy from society, and has had very large gains, according to the funds received from all parties, it is close to a number of 100,000 yuan. With the 86-year history of the Tushan Bay Orphanage, it has the most perfect equipment and has raised more than 5,500 orphans. In addition, the Catholic priests do not emphasize propaganda, but only know how to work, it is really a well-deserved practical work. Also, in order to be self-sufficient in peacetime and not solicit donations from society, people in society are also indifferent. Now, due to the continuous war, it has gradually felt the difficult situation, so that this paradise for orphans can get through this difficult time and step into Kangzhuang, this is not the responsibility of the hosts of the orphanage and the Catholics, but the responsibility that everyone in the whole society should have, because the common education of orphans is not only to serve for Catholicism, but also to serve the whole society, so the responsibility of maintaining it should also be borne by the whole society.</p>
<p>The facts are like this, and cannot be erased, their crafts are hoping that people in society will visit, and can accept all kinds of daily utensils and everything that the outside world cannot undertake in art and crafts, everyone thinks, this is also a kind of expression of the orphanage's most successful management.</p>
<p>We visited and came out, left the orphanage, and returned with Mr. Zhi Yao in the same car, remembering the most sincere French appeal that Father Zhang wrote for us to see, the original text is:</p>
<p>Tout　ctient　est　unbienfaiteur　de　I'orphelinat</p>
<p>Although I have studied French for a year, it was 30 years ago, and I have already returned it to Mr. Zhao Zhiyou? Now I only remember that the Chinese translation of this sentence is:</p>
<p>"Whoever buys orphan products is the benefactor of the orphan!"</p>
<p>I think this is the most convenient relief! Buying things can relieve people, there are many rich people in Shanghai, it is really a benevolent and inexpensive thing. Moreover, the products of the orphanage are not for the purpose of making profit, but are guaranteed by reputation, and they can really afford the four words "genuine goods at a fair price", so why not do it?

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice continues to arrive in port. Jardine Matheson's Taisheng ship, loaded with 10,000 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai at about 2:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition to carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, the ship also carried 1,000 bags of flour. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market changed from a drop to a rise. The selling prices of both forward and spot were initially low and then high, and the final results were two or three yuan better than the day before. Early morning sales were weak, but current inventories are gradually increasing. There are also continuous deliveries of public sale rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council. Orders for April and May will arrive one after another. People's hearts are weakening, and rice prices are consistently going down. Later, because the negotiated price of 1,000 tons of broken grains for foreign merchants failed to reach an agreement, it again attracted the attention of scattered speculative households. Spot sales also slightly increased. Sellers took the opportunity to defend, and prices rose again gradually. Broken grains rebounded from the lowest price of 105 yuan to 109 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was 112 yuan to 114 yuan, Min Dang high grade was 108 yuan, general grade was 106 or 107 yuan. Only the lower-grade goods, Saigon No. 2 and Siamese Saigon, were more thoroughly sold at the lower prices of the past, and the tastes of the local people were suitable, so the route suddenly became lively, with an increase of more than two yuan. Saigon No. 2 opened at 107 yuan, 106 yuan half, Siamese No. 2 from 104 yuan, sharp tip 99 yuan half, then to 103 yuan half. As for the broken tip high-grade goods, the sales are quite smooth, opening at 86 yuan, there is little change compared to the decisive price, opening at 84 or 5 yuan, deciding to 81 yuan half. Yinghua Company also rebounded at the same time, the April-May broken grain from 128 yuan to 129 yuan half, Saigon No. 1 from 134 yuan to 136 yuan, broken rice from 95 yuan to 97 yuan. The total market traded 800 tons of Yinghua Company and more than 10,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice and other types of rice arrived yesterday, totaling more than 400 stones. Sellers wanted to defend the price, but it was not effective, and the result was a stable situation. Wuxi fresh japonica rice opened at 132 or 3 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica rice opened at 130 yuan, the general market was 118 yuan to 116 yuan, Nangang early and late rice was fresh at 127 or 8 yuan, the next day to 122 yuan half, original package at 127 or 8 yuan. The supply and demand of glutinous rice was similar, with no significant difference. Hong Kong white ordinary goods opened at 110 yuan, 109 yuan, but special goods were very rare on the market and were quite sought-after, making up to 114 yuan. Zhongguan national glutinous rice also opened at 114 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour Market Hovers</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market continued to hover. Because of the continuous decline, many speculative stocks had been mostly sold off. Major firms were not eager to sell. New wheat will be on the market soon, and people's hearts are not good. The general market opened with Huawu brand Australian flour (Bank Stack) at 29 yuan 6 cents, Golden Dragon flour at 29 yuan, Fortress flour at 29 yuan 5 cents, and Green Treasure flour at 28 yuan. More than 20,000 bags were traded. Muji Street handled more than 10,000 bags, and the rest were purchased by customers. The flat-priced flour from Chinese factories was still 29 yuan, with little change for the time being. The retail price of flour on the market was as high as 31 or 2 yuan, with very high profits, not related to the official market, and there was a lack of regulation, so they did whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Wheat was stagnant as usual. All factories are waiting for the new wheat to be on the market before buying again, so the supply and demand of old wheat has long been quiet. The current market price is at 45 or 6 yuan, but there is no formal trading.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes and Corn Sold to the Interior</p>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain and oil cake market lacked new stimulus, so there was little exciting performance on both sides of the trade. The market was quite lively. Under the concept of different long and short positions, the pulling and resistance forces were evenly matched, so the overall situation turned into a roundabout trend. Statistics show that 160 or 70 loads of soybean oil were traded, more than 2,000 bags of various soybeans, and more than 3,000 bags of corn (sold to Yantai in the interior). More than 30,000 pieces of forward and spot soybean cakes were traded. Forward cakes were used as bargaining chips, while spot cakes were for the interior. Today, 480 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Finance Speculation on Foreign Exchange Returns Vigorously; British and American Banks Show Strong Appetite <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listed exchange rates. However, the black market exchange rates for British and American currencies tended to loosen and depreciate, causing the price of gold to plummet to below 6,400 yuan. Speculators initially retreated slightly but then returned vigorously. The US dollar was firm at 5.4375 yuan at noon, while the British pound softened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. This was due to a certain American bank solely purchasing 100,000 US dollars, which then stabilized the market slightly. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Japan would actively advance southward and that the US Congress had passed the cancellation of the Neutrality Act. Chinese speculators aggressively sold, but the British and American banks did not show weakness in their appetite for purchases. Consequently, the market did not loosen and remained relatively stable. The final gains for the day were 1.5615 for the British pound and 0.02125 for the US dollar, resulting in extremely active trading.</p>
<p>US Dollar Rises to 4375</p>
<p>According to morning foreign telegraphic reports on the silver market, both the large bars and the American silver were level. Indian silver depreciated again. Exchange rates in various countries showed a slight decrease of one point against Shanghai, with the rest remaining level. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Domestic spot prices opened level with bank selling prices. The British exchange rate was 2.96875 shillings per ounce, and the US dollar was 5.375 yuan. After the opening, speculators continued the previous day's buying spree, settling 10,000 US dollars for June at a price of 5.40625 yuan. Foreign banks continued to supply, causing the market to harden. The HSBC listed exchange rates remained unchanged. After the silver equalization tax remained at 24.25%, speculators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and bank transactions were scarce, indicating stability. Near noon, speculators suddenly aggressively sold June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, with Citibank alone purchasing 100,000 US dollars. American banks also absorbed some supply, and the market stabilized at noon. The US dollar closed at 5.40625 yuan at noon, and the British pound also hardened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. In the afternoon, speculators continued to aggressively sell June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, with more negative rumors circulating. However, foreign British and American banks were still interested in buying, keeping the situation relatively stable. Until the 4 pm close, spot and June futures were both 2 shillings and 3.125 pence for the British pound and 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, which were gains of 0.015625 for the British pound and 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the previous day's noon closing price.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Telegram: Spot Exchange Tight</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Thursday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened level this morning. There were no changes in the British and Japanese exchange rates. The US dollar spot rate was tight at 0.0625, at 24.4375 yuan. The Shanghai spot rate decreased by 5 jiao, to 454 yuan (yesterday's was 454 yuan and 7.5 jiao).</p>

<p>Gold Market Futures and Spot Prices Diverge</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, after initially fluctuating on the black market, suddenly declined again, with prices falling back below the 6,400 yuan level, which was quite unexpected. The sentiment of all parties, which had turned firm the previous day, became weak again. This was because the foreign exchange market suddenly tended to loosen due to improved bank selling sentiment. Securities firms resumed their activities, with Huipiao merchants Xinfengyong continuing to emerge. Under the pressure of selling, the price fell from 6,417 yuan in the morning to 6,357 yuan, which was resisted by the gold firms. The price rose slightly. In the early afternoon, the market was very stable. However, news of a sudden sharp drop in foreign stocks caused negative rumors, including that the US Congress had passed the cancellation of the Neutrality Act and that Japan would soon advance southward. Amidst sparse trading, Yiyuan and Gonghe competed to sell, pushing the price down to a low of 6,348 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market did not loosen accordingly. Securities firm Defu aggressively bought, raising the price by 30 to 40 yuan. The market closed with a small gain of 32 yuan. Total trading volume was 50,000 to 60,000 taels. Swaps (May rolling into June) were initially offered at a premium of 75 yuan by sellers, later narrowing to 70 yuan. In the afternoon, buyers offered a premium of 78 yuan, with some transactions occurring. For cash, Qingtai sold 50 taels to Chengji, and Taikangrun sold 100 taels, and Yifeng sold 50 taels, which were bought by Zhongyu and Xintianbao. The prices were all 310 yuan higher than the futures price. At noon, Chengji further bought 10 taels from Yifeng at a price 340 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Taikangrun sold 90 taels to Chengji at a price 330 yuan higher. Shunyuan and Xinyuan each sold 10 taels at a price 335 yuan higher, and Hesheng sold 30 taels at a price 340 yuan higher, all of which were bought by Shihe. This was an increase of approximately 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold also rose by 5 yuan, to 695 yuan. Guan Jin, etc. remained level.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Futures Fall Back 32 Yuan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The June futures opened at 6,415 yuan per bar (ten taels) at 9:15 am, a decrease of 2 yuan. The price rose to 6,417 yuan, but upon hearing that June US dollars could be settled at 5.40625 yuan, sentiment, which was already uncertain, softened. Hengji, Xiangyu Yong, Xinfengyong, Defu, and Tongkangyong aggressively sold, causing the price to fall by over 30 yuan to below 6,400 yuan, retreating to 6,372 yuan. Xinyuan, Defu, and Chengji aggressively bought, pushing the market up to 6,392 yuan after 10 am. Soon after, the foreign exchange market loosened again, and securities firms Tongkangyong, Defu, Chida, Jufengyong, and Xinfengyong sold, causing the market to fall by over 30 yuan, dropping to 6,357 yuan. Chengji and Yiyuan bought, raising the price by over ten yuan, and the market closed at 6,375 yuan at noon. The market opened at 6,370 yuan at 2 pm. Afterwards, supply and demand were scarce, and price fluctuations were narrow, retreating from 6,376 yuan to 67 yuan, and then rising twice to 80 yuan. After 3 pm, negative rumors suddenly arose, and Gonghe and Yiyuan aggressively sold, causing the market to plummet by over 30 yuan, dropping to 6,348 yuan. Defu, Shunyuan, Rencheng Yong, and Xinfengyong bought, pushing the market up again to 6,386 yuan. The market closed at 6,385 yuan at 4 pm, a decrease of 32 yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the settlement price of June US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, the implied gold price was 6,441.62 yuan, a premium of 56.62 yuan. The price rose to 6,390 yuan after the close, and finally to 85-87 yuan. There was a difference of 69 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold by reputable firms was 350 yuan higher than the hot red futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current mark gold.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the hot red market price break into the 400 yuan level again, causing both the British pound and gold pound to fall by one yuan. British gold tickets remained stagnant as before, with the market price holding steady. US dollar tickets once retreated to 0.08 points, but eventually closed at 18.15 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.08 points compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets had even supply and demand, with the market price holding steady. The decline in Japanese gold tickets has already stopped, and the evening market remained at the original level of 2.04 yuan. Korean tickets tended to decrease, with the evening market retreating to 1.72 yuan.</p>

<p>Public Price Black Market: Yesterday, sentiment was relatively strong, with slight adjustments to cover short positions, but trading did not improve significantly. In the morning, Yitai bought, and Datong Dechang also bought a significant amount. Lianhe, Jiufu, and Changkang sold, and the market price showed signs of firming. In the afternoon, Yitai suddenly turned to selling again, and Lianhe also disposed of some holdings, with the two firms selling approximately 500,000 yuan, which were completely absorbed by Tiansheng, Hongda, and Qianyi. The price was even firmer than in the morning, eventually rising back by 0.051 to 0.25, with a trading volume of 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Yarn and Cotton: Heavy Pressure on Yarn Market, 400 Yuan Level Almost Broken <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising together for ten days, suddenly declined yesterday, with a trend as chaotic as hemp. Recently, the short side has been strong, with numerous rumors. At the same time, all the bullish announcements come from the short side. However, the large traders and buyers with significant capital remained firm, rolling their acquired positions daily without any intention of closing out. As for the general outsiders, their intention to short was strong, resulting in heavy pressure. In the morning, the 20s Double Horse narrowly escaped breaking the 400 yuan level. It is said that a certain group has already shifted from short to long, leading to a slight rebound, but sales remain sluggish. The high price for 20s Double Horse was 1,436 yuan, and the low price was 1,402 yuan. In the early afternoon, the price was 1,416 yuan, but due to active short selling, it fell to 1,402 yuan. However, a certain large trader continued to buy, pushing the price back up to 1,409 yuan. Finally, news of a rebound in the gold price boosted sentiment, raising the price to 1,418 yuan. Trading was exceptionally active in the afternoon, reflecting the intense speculation among traders. 490 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and due to the weakening momentum of the previous afternoon, the market continued to be weak. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, briefly rising to 1,436 yuan. However, as soon as this price opened, sellers rushed in, causing the price to fall to 1,415 yuan. Subsequently, those who profited covered their short positions, causing the market to rebound to 1,423 yuan. After 11:30 am, upon hearing that spot yarn trading was weak and that foreign exchange was loosening, and mark gold was declining, sentiment suddenly turned weak, and selling resumed, falling directly to 1,402 yuan. At this time, the selling pressure was overwhelming, but a portion of traders took advantage of the weakness to buy, pushing the market back up to 1,410 yuan at closing. Total trading volume for the half-day was 17,050 bales, including 50 bales by Hong Kong firms and 17,000 bales by local firms.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Indian Cotton Arrived Yesterday: 879 Bales <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading remains quiet, but sentiment remains calm. However, the factories' needs remain restrained. Nevertheless, foreign cotton trends are firm and rising, so the situation can still be maintained. Taicang flower is priced at 215 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Trading by Foreign Firms: Because international conditions are unpredictable, and at the same time, spot yarn prices are gradually declining, both domestic and foreign cotton spinning mills have no intention of purchasing. Yesterday, apart from a resale of 300 bales of Brazilian cotton among peers at a price of 406 yuan, there was nothing else to report.</p>
<p>Indian cotton transshipped from Hong Kong: The Shanghai-India shipping route, after the expansion of the European war, saw the British company's ships requisitioned by the Admiralty, resulting in a shortage of vessels and the suspension of service. However, the Hong Kong-India route continued to operate, so Indian cotton could not be shipped directly to Shanghai, but could only be transported from Bombay or Calcutta to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Taishang Wheel, carrying 879 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday afternoon and was unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quite lively and firm, due to buying by peers and the renewed freeze in Washington, and the increase in government lending. As a result, the closing price rose by 8 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, but subsequently fell back due to selling by speculators and profit-taking by longs. Yesterday's closing prices varied by about one rupee. The forecast for today's opening is a slight decline of one rupee.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Stagnant <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was dull yesterday, with selling prices continuing to decline. This was due to heavy selling pressure and hesitant buyers. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, while coarse cloth fell by approximately 0.25 yuan. There was no formal market price for bleached and dyed cloth, and prices were very chaotic. Local street transactions involved over 200 pieces of various cloths, with fellow traders absorbing some at low prices. Sales to customers were stagnant. Shandong firms handled over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, dyed cloth, etc., and Guangdong/Nanyang firms handled over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, bleached, dyed, and printed cloth. 510 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Due to continued sluggish sales of East cloth, the selling pressure from both inside and outside the industry was particularly strong, leading to a sharp decline. The futures price of Longtou fine cloth, a white good, fell sharply by 1.56 yuan per piece, and the factory order fell by around 1 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 45.8 yuan. The factory order for the Four Gentlemen serge, a colored good, fell by 3.5 fen per yard, and the closing price was 1.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Sugar Market: Futures Continue to Rise <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise. The guild quoted a price of 106 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar ex-warehouse and 103.5 yuan for goods arriving in January. Futures for settlement at the end of this month opened at 107-108 yuan, closing back down to 106.3 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan. Futures for settlement on the 10th of next month were 107.5-108 yuan, closing at 107 yuan, with an equal increase. Taikoo granulated white B mark, Western warehouse, was 108-108.5 yuan, Eastern warehouse, 108.5 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. DY mark, bagged, was 99 yuan, and provincial packed, 100 yuan, also an increase of 1 yuan. The rest were lacking market activity.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Coal: Longtan Powder New: —Over Three Thousand Tons— <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Although the price of dust coal has recently been declining, a large batch of lower-grade goods is on the way and arriving continuously. Yesterday, a certain firm again shipped 3,000 tons of Longtan powder from inland, which has already arrived. To cope with the declining prices, they have to reduce prices for quick sales. Among the traders, the asking price for wharf goods is 110 yuan per ton, but in this slow selling season, high-grade goods are immobile, and lower-grade goods are also difficult to move, so transactions are few and far between, and no one is interested.</p>
<p>Hardware: Rebar Situation Turns</p>
<p>Black iron billets were previously sluggish due to slow sales and abundant inventory. Recently, local billet manufacturers, iron printing factories, and machinery manufacturers have started purchasing, and the situation is gradually turning around. Traders' sentiment is also firm, and asking prices have risen back up. Yesterday, the asking price per bundle was 3,300 yuan, an increase of 40 to 50 yuan compared to before. Total transactions for the city were approximately 30 to 40 bundles.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Banks (2) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Revenue replied:</p>
<p>"The China General Commercial Bank is to be granted a loan of one million taels of government silver by the Ministry, with interest calculated annually... Currently, the branch offices in various places are just beginning operations. To immediately order all customs offices in each province to deposit and remit official funds to the said bank, which is not trusted by all, would be difficult to enforce and might appear to be monopolistic, obstructing commercial transactions in the market. However, if the official funds deposited and remitted by the customs offices in each province, as stated in the original memorial, are to be exclusively entrusted to private silver firms without any involvement with the bank, then the government-established bank will not be trusted by the government itself. How can it be expected that merchants and civilians will trust it? This is not in line with the state's intention to maintain banks and promote commerce... It is proposed that the provinces be instructed that, in the future, in places where there is a General Commercial Bank, the remittance of all official funds should be entrusted to the General Commercial Bank for prudent handling, provided that it is verified that this will not result in losses and that remittance fees can be reduced."</p>
<p>From these two paragraphs, it is important to note that (1) the term "Chinese Bank" is used in contrast to "Western Bank," referring to a bank established by Chinese, not like the current Bank of China, which uses China as its name. (2) Sheng Xuanhuai's appointment as Director-General of Railways was after August of the 22nd year of Guangxu, and Sheng Xuanhuai's memorandum was even later. Therefore, the initiation of the China General Commercial Bank was in the 22nd year of Guangxu, and the commencement of operations was in April of the 23rd year of Guangxu, but it is mistaken to say that it was established in the 22nd year. (3) The term "General Commercial Bank" was a common term at the time. For example, in the memorial of Shengjing General Yiketang'a in the 24th year of Guangxu, asking to issue paper currency, it also mentioned assigning the issuance of banknotes to the bank, and stated, "At various ports, funds will be raised by the Customs Daotai to establish a General Commercial Bank," indicating that the intention to establish banks at the time was related to commerce. Therefore, Sheng used this name for his bank. (4) The Ministry of Revenue's unwillingness to entrust the depositing and remitting of official funds from the provinces and customs offices to the General Commercial Bank laid the foundation for the later establishment of the Ministry of Revenue Bank.</p>
<p>The issuance of banknotes by the General Commercial Bank is also mentioned in the Ministry of Revenue's reply to Shengjing General Yiketang'a's memorial asking to issue paper currency, which states:</p>
<p>"In the 22nd year of Guangxu, Sheng Xuanhuai requested to first establish a Chinese Bank in Beijing and Shanghai, with branch offices established in provincial capitals and ports. The bank would be managed by merchants and directors, and silver notes would be printed to circulate alongside silver. He would be responsible for raising capital jointly to establish the bank, and would be granted one million taels of official funds as an incentive. It is now requested that Sheng Xuanhuai be ordered to investigate the measures proposed by the Shanghai bank since its establishment that would be sufficient to recover economic rights and report them in detail for further consideration."

<p>The Jingwu Cup 4th Annual Table Tennis Championship, organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association, is scheduled for the grand finals on the 25th of this month (Sunday) at 9:30 AM (new time) at the Daxin Ballroom on Yuqiaqing Road. This year's cup competition has been recognized by the Shanghai Table Tennis Association as the Shanghai Table Tennis Player of the Year competition. The ten group championships are mainly contested by the top three strong teams in Shanghai. Although it is directly an individual championship, it indirectly relates to the reputation of each team, so the competition is fierce. Unexpected upsets have occurred repeatedly. Xue Xuchu has won all eight matches, with only the final match against Lu Hanjun remaining. The former is a rising star from Huayi, and the championship seems within reach. The latter is a pillar of Qingyun and has won the cup twice. To maintain personal honor, he will fight to the death. Wang Jiuqing has only lost one match and originally had hopes for second place. If Lu Hanjun can beat Xue Xuchu, then Xue and Wang will face off in a close battle, and it is uncertain who will win. Ouyang Wei, a strong player from overseas, has the demeanor of a great general, not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Although he has four wins and three losses, he is still willing to give it his all. Others such as Chuan Qifang, Zhang Zhihong, Yang Zhaoxiang, and Wang Huizhang are evenly matched. It is reported that tickets are available in two denominations, one yuan and two yuan. The two-yuan tickets are for reserved seating and are already on sale at the association.</p>

<p>Chinese-Western Cup Women's Table Tennis Tournament: Women's Youth Team Defeats Jewish Team; Perennial Champions Suffer a Narrow Loss; Hualian Women Have a Good Chance of Winning</p>
<p>In the Chinese-Western Cup Table Tennis Tournament, the Women's Youth Team once again faced the perennial champions, the Jewish team, at the auditorium of the Women's Youth Association the night before last. Besides Zhang Jiazhen, the other four players, Fang Xiuwen, Hu Jiahe, Xu Ruilan, and Zhang Dexin, are all outstanding students of the veteran table tennis player Mr. Chen Linsheng. Their skills are extraordinary. In the first round, the Women's Youth Team was defeated by the Jewish team due to incomplete personnel. This second encounter was a battle between rivals. Under the leadership of Mrs. Difey, the latter had been invincible since the start of the tournament. Moreover, due to Hualian's withdrawal last time, they were almost certain to win this year's championship. Hualian was only one point behind, so their hope of winning the championship rested on the Women's Youth Team's match against the Jewish team. The serious nature of the match was related to international honor, so both sides went all out to compete. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. In the four rounds, they tied each other ten times. At the start of the final round, Mrs. Difey relied on the spin of her chopping technique to defeat Zhang Jiazhen of the Women's Youth Team. Jewish newcomer Su Lun defeated Zhang Dexin, giving them an absolute advantage with a score of 12-10. If the Women's Youth Team lost another match, all their efforts would be in vain. Unexpectedly, Xu Ruilan of the Women's Youth Team performed exceptionally well, winning a point against Miss Newman of the Jewish team. Hu Jiahe continued the momentum and defeated Hai Xutuo, bringing the Women's Youth Team back to a tie of 12-12. The final game was the focus of the outcome for both sides. Miss Fang Xiuwen of the Women's Youth Team relied on her bold and powerful strokes, which were accurate and effective, and she became more courageous as she fought. In the end, Fang lived up to expectations, defeating Liu Fan 21-16. The entire team finally defeated the Jewish team 13-12. Not only did they avenge their previous defeat, but they also created hope for Hualian to win the championship. It is reported that Hualian and the Jewish team have decided to hold a championship match next Friday. It is expected that Hualian can retain the championship, which is truly an honor for the Chinese people. The results of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Women's Youth Wins/Losses Jewish Wins/Losses</p>
<p>Zhang Dexin 1 4 Mrs. Difey 5 0</p>
<p>Xu Ruilan 3 2 Su Lun 4 1</p>
<p>Hu Jiahe 3 2 Newman 1 4</p>
<p>Fang Xiuwen 3 2 Hai Xutuo 1 4</p>
<p>Zhang Jiazhen 3 2 Liu Fan 1 4</p>

<h3 id="e80">How to Study Painting (4) By Shi Chongpeng <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>4.  The Theory of Painting</p>
<p>The methods of studying Chinese and Western painting are different, and there are also great differences in theory. Now I will explain them separately to help comrades who are learning painting to gain a deeper understanding. The theory of Chinese painting is very mysterious, and there are many viewpoints. Among them, the most powerful and straightforward is Xie He's Six Principles from the Southern Qi Dynasty: 1. Qi Yun Sheng Dong (Spirit Resonance, or Vitality), 2. Gu Fa Yong Bi (Structural Method in Using the Brush), 3. Ying Wu Xiang Xing (Resemblance to the Object), 4. Sui Lei Fu Cai (Suitability in Applying Colors), 5. Jing Ying Wei Zhi (Planning and Composition), 6. Zhuan Yi Mo Xie (Transmission by Copying). The first principle, Qi Yun Sheng Dong, belongs to the spiritual realm, because painting without spirit is like a human being or animal without life, unable to live. The second principle, Gu Fa Yong Bi, is about the lines used in brushwork, which are used to depict and assemble. It is also a very important element in Chinese painting. The third principle, Ying Wu Xiang Xing, is about outlining the shape of objects. However, the outlining here is not like Western painting's focus on light and shadow, perspective, but rather capturing the general appearance of the object, with plenty of room for stretching and transformation. The fourth principle, Sui Lei Fu Cai, is about the application of color. The use of color is not a crucial issue in Chinese painting. There are many paintings that only use ink to express themselves, without borrowing the embellishment of color, and still possess a unique charm. Different shades of color are distinguished within the simple ink color, which is called "ink dividing into five colors." The fifth principle, Jing Ying Wei Zhi, is about composition. Composition occupies a very important position in Chinese painting. Although Chinese painting also applies the "Ying Wu Xiang Xing" method of sketching from life, the composition and arrangement on the canvas must have sufficient changes and careful planning, what is called "having bamboo in the chest," one more stroke is too much, one less stroke is too little, it is very subtle, so that the picture achieves the most beautiful state. The sixth principle, Zhuan Yi Mo Xie, is about copying existing paintings. As mentioned earlier, Chinese painting requires starting with copying. Without proper copying, one cannot engage in Chinese painting, especially the masterpieces of the ancients, which must be copied. However, one should not simply copy blindly. Blind copying not only does not bring benefits but also fosters laziness and a lack of creativity. In general, people often have doubts about Chinese painting. By studying the Six Principles, we can understand it clearly.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Another World: Unable to Eat <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>"Master, Madam, come down for dinner."</p>
<p>"Young Master, Miss, come down for dinner."</p>
<p>The old nanny called loudly from downstairs.</p>
<p>Those upstairs heard these four calls and slowly walked downstairs.</p>
<p>The ten-year-old little brother was the first to dash down, but he quickly came back up.</p>
<p>"Why are you coming back up, little brother? Come down and eat," his second sister stopped him and told him to go down.</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat. There's not a single good dish," the little brother pouted and walked toward his room.</p>
<p>"No, you must come down and eat today. We let you order a dish every day, but today we forgot to buy it, so you won't eat?" his father said sternly.</p>
<p>The little brother had no choice but to go down. The shrimp, fish, and shredded meat in the bowl on the table did not suit his taste. Every day, he had to have chunks of spareribs to eat. He also had a strange habit: the shrimp, fish, and meat had to be plain stir-fried. If some vegetables or other things were added, he would not eat it; he would refuse to eat the whole bowl of food.</p>
<p>"Eat quickly. If you don't eat, we won't buy anything for you to eat in the future," his father was particularly fierce today, for some reason.</p>
<p>The little brother picked up his chopsticks, and tears dripped into his rice bowl. But stubborn as he was, he didn't pick at any of the dishes, but stuffed mouthfuls of white rice into his mouth. In less than two minutes, he left the table, considering himself to have finished eating.</p>
<p>"Why isn't Mom coming down for dinner?" his third sister suddenly noticed that Mom hadn't come down and exclaimed. She sent the nanny upstairs to invite her.</p>
<p>"Madam says she's feeling a little unwell today and doesn't want to eat dinner. She'll buy noodles to eat later!" the nanny reported back.</p>
<p>"Second sister, can I share some of my rice with you?" his tenth sister had just come back from college and barely had room for a grain of rice in her stomach, but she was afraid of being scolded by her father, so she could only force herself to pretend to eat.</p>
<p>"I can't eat either. I ate too many snacks today. You should share it with our eldest sister!"</p>
<p>"Don't you go recommending me. We had a tea party at school today, and I filled my stomach with sweets and snacks," his eldest sister quickly said, giving a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>"Miss, if you can't eat, leave it. We can give it to Ah Hua later," the clever Ah Jin resolved this "crisis" of excess rice.</p>
<p>"Eat fewer snacks in the future. Rice prices are so expensive, and you still keep saying you can't eat. Think about the beggars on the streets who are hungry and have no food to eat. Then you'll be satisfied!" It was his father's voice again.</p>
<p>In fact, he himself ate out almost every day, and invitations to banquets kept coming: "Jinmen," "International Hotel," "Meihua".... He himself told us that he was tired of eating these dishes and preferred to order a plate of green vegetables and tofu at home.</p>
<p>"Dad, it's not like we can't eat every day. You rarely eat at home, and it just so happens that we're all full of snacks today," his third sister said playfully.</p>
<p>His father didn't say anything. But after that, at every meal, it was still the same: everyone kept saying, "I can't eat!"</p>
<p>What with rice prices rising and falling, what with speculators manipulating the market, people in this family paid no attention.</p>
<p>On the street, three people were seen snatching rice, and they were caught by the police and beaten severely.</p>
<p>"Ah! Young people don't work, but they snatch rice. They deserve it!" his third sister said with a sigh.</p>
<p>On the street, there was a long line of people in rags, old, young, and middle-aged, all vying to do something.</p>
<p>"Eldest sister, what are these people doing?" the little brother asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"They're scrambling to buy broken rice," his eldest sister answered calmly.</p>
<p>"Can you eat broken rice?" the little brother was even more surprised.</p>
<p>"You have white rice but won't eat it and only want spareribs. These poor people can't even afford broken rice!"</p>
<p>Although the little brother didn't say anything, he was thinking in his heart: How can they compare to us? My father earns money every day. They're poor people, and we're rich! With a turn of his mind, the little brother suddenly thought of a sentence:</p>
<p>"Eldest sister, you don't need to talk about me. Don't you also say 'I can't eat' every day?"</p>

<p>— Huiran</p>
<p>Mr. Zong looked haggard and distressed, sitting blankly on the large sofa. It was very noisy outside the window, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zong, wearing a new summer outfit, drifted into the bedroom. Although the sound of her leather shoes was very loud, it did not change Mr. Zong's attitude.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zong was surprised to see her husband's abnormal attitude. "What! Are you unhappy again? Who angered you!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zong cast his dim gaze over his wife, lingered for a moment, and remained silent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zong was even more puzzled, but she had no way to elicit her husband's thoughts. She listlessly took off her spring dress and her leather shoes.</p>
<p>The room was quiet, with only the "tick-tock" of the clock dispelling the barrier between the two.</p>
<p>"Have you had dinner?" Mrs. Zong asked clearly.</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten!" Mr. Zong said softly.</p>
<p>"Then should I call and order a meal for you?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to eat. I can't eat!"</p>
<p>"Who are you quarreling with! You don't even want to eat dinner!" Mrs. Zong took advantage of the only opportunity to entice her husband to tell her the reason for his depression.</p>
<p>"Damn it, rice prices have fallen to such a low point!"</p>
<p>"Then the five hundred bags of rice you bought last week will be a loss!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it! Last week I bought them for one hundred and thirty-five yuan, and now they've fallen to one hundred and fifteen yuan. It's a loss of more than ten thousand!"</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you to sell them when they were at one hundred and fifty yuan! You insisted that rice prices would reach two hundred yuan. Now, good, not only didn't you earn anything, but you've lost so much!"</p>
<p>"Who wants you to taunt me? The situation is already like this. I just won't sell them. I'll see how low they can go!"</p>
<p>"Strange, what is the reason they've fallen like this!"</p>
<p>"......"</p>

<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>I happened to see an illustration in an American magazine of a dance hall in a city near the front lines of a European warring country. Although many still maintain their business, they are only for the entertainment of frontline soldiers, and civilians are not allowed to enter. Therefore, a sign with the words "Uniform only" is newly hung at the entrance of some dance halls.</p>
<p>But in this place of singing and dancing, the dance hall has a sign that says "Armed soldiers are not welcome". The same form of enjoyment, but contains two different contents. (Uniform unwelcome).</p>
<p>I am very interested in these two contrasts.</p>

<p>(8) Appreciable Friendship</p>
<p>"Sure! Why wouldn't it be possible?"</p>
<p>"However, if you have to pay extra, Lao San, it can only be charged to your account!" As he rang the bell, he pretended to be very serious.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Would it be possible for us to get a box of matches?" The nurse came in, and Yu Kun stood up and said to her, "Also, may I ask you, is it possible for my friend to eat something now?"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang really didn't expect that he would take this opportunity to coax him to eat.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't it be? The difficulty lies in him not wanting to eat himself!" The nurse said solemnly.</p>
<p>"He feels better now, probably because he saw me!" Seeing his funny look, the female nurse couldn't help but smile. "So I persuaded him to eat something, and he himself is willing to eat."</p>
<p>"Okay, then I'll go get the chicken soup right away!" The nurse immediately went out again.</p>
<p>Yu Kun picked up the rumpled long gown that he had just taken off from the chair and threw it casually over his shoulder. The crumpled and bent cigarette was stuffed back into his pocket again.</p>
<p>"Lao San, Meibao is doing well. According to my inquiries from everyone, everyone says her mother is also doing well. Yuan the Fat Man didn't make things difficult for her, and she's doing well in Beijing right now. That way, your heart can be at peace!" He stood between the hospital bed and the door, with a seriousness on his face that had never been seen before. "I can't delay any longer. The doctor wants to buy a few foreign biscuits for Meibao to eat! We can't talk about anything else right now. I just want to persuade you to rest and recuperate. It doesn't matter if you can't eat as an actor. No one in the world starves to death! If you worry so much that you don't eat or sleep, you'll really kill yourself! Good brother, please put your mind at ease!"</p>

<h3 id="e85">Longevity Star <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>The Longevity Star is neither a god, nor a Buddha, nor a ghost. The Longevity Star is a person.</p>
<p>But the reason why he is called the Longevity Star is because he "does good deeds"!</p>
<p>The Longevity Star was originally called Wang Ba (turtle).</p>
<p>It is not clear from what time he was called that. It is also not clear where he was called that. It seems that Wang Ba was born to be the Longevity Star. If the Longevity Star does not appear, what will happen to the people?</p>
<p>Although, sometimes he is happy and "admires" himself in the mirror for a while: his forehead is as long as a washboard, plus triangular eyes, an eagle nose, and a lion's mouth, but it's also a bit... But the Longevity Star is ultimately about longevity, "by the mandate of Heaven"!</p>
<p>Wang Ba, no! The Longevity Star is this year a ripe old age, no more, no less, just over forty years old. He is right between old and "young"; so "respect your elders as you would your own; care for the young as you would your own", he is perfect!</p>
<p>Once, he "stored" rice; once, he "stored" coal; and many times, he "stored" many things. There is a "reason" for this; and this "reason" is said to have been given to him by Jesus, that is, in the future, when Shanghai is truly "isolated", the five million citizens will not have to stretch out their legs and wait for death.</p>
<p>"I have to think for others every day I live!" he often said in a very "serious" manner, and his chest was like a copper drum, beating with a booming sound. "I would rather "tire" myself to death than let people "in the future" starve to death!"</p>
<p>But people are confused.</p>
<p>Now, the news of the sale of Hong Kong rice has reached his ears, and the Longevity Star has changed: "You don't understand me, they don't understand me, you can't let good people lose money!" This time he is not patting his chest; he is stamping his feet.</p>
<p>But people are confused.</p>
<p>So, he cries on this side and jumps on that side; if you are full and have nothing to do and go to persuade him, he will take you as the "representative" of the five million citizens; scold you a lot, "teach" you a lesson, shake his head, sigh, and leave.</p>
<p>The Longevity Star is so "wronged", I am afraid there are no ancient people before him, and there will be no future generations after him!</p>
<p>No wonder the Longevity Star wants to be like "true"; several new lines have been added to his forehead, his beard is as messy as overgrown thatch, and he is as dull as wood...</p>

<h3 id="e86">Tangled Matchmaking: Hollywood's Fortune Tellers <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>In Hollywood, it can be said that there are all kinds of people, and many interesting news of all kinds have been generated. There are also fortune-tellers there who make a living by reciting a few incantations, because many female stars believe in superstition, so those fortune-tellers' business is also booming.</p>
<p>Recently, an astrologer named Ansel has published some information about the marriage of female stars, just like "Justice Qiao matching couples at random." It's fun because it's so messy. He thinks that Betty Grable, the leading actress in "Red Flower and Fragrant Song" and "Immortal Music Street" (recently elected as the "best figure" female star in Hollywood), is a moon star, and she is always hesitant in doing things. She should marry someone like Taylor Power. But I don't know what he will do with Annabella? (Betty Grable's ex-husband is Jack Coghen, a red child star from ten years ago who has now retired.)</p>
<p>He believes that Katharine Hepburn, the leading actress in "Old Love, New Favor," who recently returned to the film industry from Broadway, should marry someone like the musician Stokowski. Katharine Hepburn is considered a "mysterious female star" in Hollywood, and her marriage has never been settled. But Stokowski is already very old, and Katharine Hepburn is only old enough to be his daughter. Do you think this prediction is absurd?</p>
<p>He also said many strange things, such as Jean Arthur should marry Dana Andrews, Susan Hayward should marry Edward G. Robinson, Bette Davis should marry Laurence Olivier, Lucille Ball should marry Jascha Heifetz, the violin expert of "Melody of Spring," and Diana Durbin should marry Henry Fonda. But in fact, some of them have only been married for a short time, such as Diana Durbin and Vaughn Paul, and Bette Davis and Arthur Farnsworth, while some already have children.</p>

<p>Minhua's fourth work has been named "Tears of Longing." It is said that the script was submitted from the outside and the plot is quite novel. However, because the company's photography studio has been temporarily taken back by Meicheng to produce "Hong Guanjiao," the play has been decided to postpone production until mid-September.</p>
<p>Li Ming, a newcomer from Guolian, has not developed in the company, so it has been rumored recently that he will join the Lubaobao Theater. It is said that Gu Menghu is currently in negotiations, and it is likely to become a reality.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work after "Blue Sea, Blue Sky" has been named "Soul Returns to Autumn River." The film was originally scheduled to star Chen Yanyan, but because Chen played an important role in the play "Home," she could not handle both, so it was decided to have Yuan Meiyun play the lead role.</p>
<p>The ancient costume film "Wang Zhaojun" was originally intended to be discontinued, but because the Guolian authorities did not want to waste the film, it has been decided to continue production. However, the position of director has been changed to Yang Xiaozhong.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Theater Company's "City of Sorrow" is said to be adapted into a film by a certain company. However, because the play is a severe satire of rice merchants, the content of the play will be slightly changed.</p>

<p>The first object of life is to advocate labor. Everyone should practice the idea that hands are all-powerful and labor is sacred, with each person being a productive component. The second is to strive to serve others. I serve others, and do not allow others to serve me. Everyone should consider it their duty to help others stand and to help others succeed.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Why Does He Pity You, Arriving at the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>Because Liu Yinyang was being coy and wouldn't take off his long gown, and Liu Yinying's aunt was also there, he felt it inconvenient to take it off himself. He simply tucked the corners of his gown into his belt, front and back, drew the Crimson Phoenix sword from its scabbard, walked to the center of the courtyard, and said to Liu Yinyang, "How presumptuous." Slowly, he began to dance, moving forward and backward, left and right, up and down, all in time with the rhythm. Xu Jing this evening was doing his best to show off his skills. He only regretted that his swordsmanship was ordinary, with nothing striking about it, and he couldn't compete with others. Therefore, after dancing a routine of Plum Blossom Swordplay, he immediately stopped and said to Liu Yinyang with a smile, "A poor donkey's skill, this is all there is to it. Please don't laugh at me, Brother Liu." Liu Yinying, after watching Xu Jing's sword dance, smiled and said, "This is already not easy, but if you want to reach the highest level, you still need to practice diligently." Xu Jing said, "I have no famous teacher to instruct me, so I am stuck in place, making no progress. Now that I have met Brother Liu, I hope you will not hesitate to give me some guidance. After I finish my dance, I would like to see Brother Liu's profound swordsmanship, so that I may get a glimpse of the secrets." Liu Yinying then swung his sword and said, "Then I will also make a fool of myself once." So, he raised the White Energy Sword upwards, performing the White Crane Soaring to the Sky posture, swooshing and rattling as he danced faster and faster, like a hawk swooping down on a rabbit, like a phoenix soaring and flying, with dazzling swordplay in a myriad of forms. Xu Jing clapped his hands and exclaimed, "Excellent!" Liu Yinyang's aunt laughed and said, "Tonight, Ying'er is so elegant, dancing for a while is enough. Quickly stop and accompany Master Xu to eat." Liu Yinying abruptly stopped the sword dance, stood smiling in front of Xu Jing, and said, "My meager skills are barely worthy of your sight. I hope they do not offend our esteemed guest?" Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship is so brilliant, yet he is so humble, which makes me even more ashamed." The two then returned to the guest room, put down their swords, returned to their original seats, and poured each other a full cup. The little maid had already brought up a plate of cooked chicken. Liu Yinying accompanied Xu Jing in drinking another cup. Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship is unparalleled in the world, and I am completely overwhelmed. May I ask Brother Liu to tell me about his life experience? There must be something surprising and delightful about it." Liu Yinying shook his head and said, "The past is something that makes people sad when brought up, and it is not something to be told to outsiders. Let's wait until later to tell you. In short, I am an isolated person, drifting around the world. Only my aunt here is my closest relative. Master Xu, let's drink a few more cups." Seeing that Liu Yinying repeatedly refused to speak directly, he guessed that he had some unspeakable secrets, and did not dare to press him. He raised his cup and drank another cup, and then poured more wine. He saw Liu Yinying supporting his chin with one hand, looking at the lamplight, as if recalling the past. He picked up the wine cup and said, "Please." (70)</p>

<p>— Wu Ming</p>
<p>Since Jin Xinmin founded the Minhua Company and successfully produced the film "Confucius," which received critical acclaim, he has, in effect, established his superior position in the film world. Recently, Jin Xinmin has also partnered with Zheng Weixian of the MGM Dance Hall and others to establish the Yu Gu Restaurant, located in the western part of the New World. After more than four months of renovation, it officially opened yesterday, with Xu Qianlin, Wen Lanting, and He Wuliang, prominent figures, officiating the opening.</p>
<p>The opening time was 10 a.m. The reporter squeezed into the Jin Gu in the crowd. The entrance was filled with flower baskets sent by various circles, exuding a burst of fragrance, attracting the attention of passers-by. Stepping on the stairs, a bright, colorful parrot was nodding to everyone who went upstairs to greet them. It is said that this parrot was sent by Fei Mu and his three brothers and is worth over a hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Upstairs, there are a total of five rooms, including two large rooms, a large hall, and the Flying Scissors, each with a deck. In each room, He Ming broadcasts the latest Chinese and Western music, leaving the guests with a beautiful impression. The "Confucius" song was specially broadcasted by He Ming yesterday, which is a solemn and sacred song that has never been heard on the market. It is said that the new design of Jin Gu was designed by Fei Kang, the younger brother of Fei Mu, and constructed by the Yaping Decoration Company. The air conditioning was installed by the Hezong Company. All the equipment is unique and novel, making it a leader in Shanghai.</p>
