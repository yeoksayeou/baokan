<h3>赫爾發表正式文告　美國遠東政策不變　援華事項將由霍浦金辦理　中常會討論日蘇條約後果</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨在招待新聞記者時改變其平日習慣發表正式文告、內稱報載蘇日中立條約之意義、易為人過分重視、其實此約似說明兩國間早已存在之一種局勢耳、故無足驚異、而雙方政府願否如約辦理、尚有疑問、至於美政府之政策、當然始終不變云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　中國駐美大使胡適博士昨稱、蘇聯與日本簽訂中立協定、乃足使中國「感到失望」之事胡適博士與財長毛根韜會晤後告人、「吾人未得蘇日協定全文之前、不能預測該約如何重要、惟該約實為值得遺憾之事、吾人希望蘇聯將不致停止對華援助焉、」胡博士又稱、「蘇聯已於過去若干時期中予中國以援助、中國復期望此種援助仍將繼續、」宋子文氏與財部官員晤談時、胡大使則與財長毛根韜談話、宋氏謂、渠相信中美不日成立鞏固基金協定之情形、「極為順利」云、（十五日合眾社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　財長毛根韜昨日聲稱、美國對華之援助、最低限度、將維持目前之程度、霍浦金氏將辦理此項事務、霍氏為前任商務部長、其援華之事項、將由財部之若干專家予以襄助云、（十五日合眾社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中常會昨晨討論日蘇條約所造成之局勢、歷時頗久、有關係之各部部長、亦於午後集合、研究此項問題、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>渝各報皆表示不滿　新華日報則加辯護</h3>
<p>重慶　國民黨及中央軍之官方機關報、皆表示中央政府對於星期日在莫斯科簽訂之日蘇中立條約極為不滿、但共黨機關報新華日報則謂此種評論、皆係不公正之無理取鬧、國民黨機關重慶政府之主要發言工具中央日報謂、該約殊可惋惜、並謂該約暨其附隨之共同宣言皆違反一九三七年之中蘇不侵犯公約及一九二四年之中蘇協定、中央日報評論標題為「侵害中國主權」、內稱「蘇聯當局屢次表示決意不承認滿洲國、但言猶在耳、而彼等已忘却此項諾言」云、該報警告蘇聯政府謂與日本所訂之協定、皆係不可靠者、中央軍機關報掃蕩報亦同樣批評日蘇條約、該報評論稱、「吾人對於國際正義之展望、非常悲觀、並認吾人友邦（蘇聯）所採之行動極可惋惜」、中國共黨機關報、新華日報則極力反對蘇日公約之批評、並謂甚至與該約同時在莫斯科發表之共同宣言、亦無影響外蒙及滿洲之土地完整、蘇聯之允諾不侵滿洲國、應解釋為蘇聯宣布不以武力侵略滿洲、並不能解釋為蘇聯承滿洲國為獨立國家、亦不影響於吾人之從事收復滿洲、至謂新約與一九三七年之中蘇不侵公約相抵觸、則實屬不通、因兩約之性質完全不同也、吾人不能容忍反蘇宣傳、以反蘇之立場、惡意批評此事、天主教益世報攻擊日蘇條約頗烈、謂其違反中蘇不侵公約、該約規定、蘇聯有不與中國之敵人締結條約之義務、日蘇條約且亦違反一九二四年之協定、該協定由蘇聯完全承認外蒙為中國領土之一部、益世報評論云、「現在蘇聯公然將外蒙與滿洲國同視、此舉使蘇聯之威望受重大損失、蘇聯為松岡所欺矣、」益世報謂、日本顯欲在德蘇如發生戰事時、保持中立而不受三強公約之拘束、該報復預言日蘇締約之後、而蘇聯則將在巴爾幹作反德活動、該報又謂日蘇新約、將使美國增加對英國中國希臘及南斯拉夫之援助云、（十五日合眾社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中央日報載、記者昨午往蘇聯大使館訪問蘇大使潘友新、由該館二等秘書郭瓦爾夫接見、據稱、潘大使頃患胃病、未能接見賓客、甚以為歉、後記者雖就國際形勢提出書面問題數項請益、潘大使亦因病未能致答、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美各報對中立條約意見紛歧頗不一致</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國各重要報紙對於蘇日中立條約之反響與推測、殊不一致、惟一般論調、咸認為條約對於全世界局勢、俱有影響、而對於美國之影響為尤大、各報對於下列三層、俱表一致之意見、（一）日本已向在太平洋上自由活動、美國之注意力因而不得不加緊援助應該、而轉移至太平洋上、（二）蘇聯在亞洲已告安全、可以在西方自由行動、蓋蘇聯在西方之利益、已受納碎勢力之威脅也、（三）締約國彼此仍有猜忌之心、蘇日條約僅能在彼此有利之期間發生效力、兩國家能否藉蘇日條約獲得其目下所宣傳之種種利益、須視條約成立時之環境是日方將來如何利用條約兩　以為斷蘇日是否將積極與軸心合作、殊成疑問、但中立條約成立以後、日本已予蘇聯以實施反德政策之自由、蘇聯則予日本以推行反美反英政策較大之自由、倘若蘇聯當局認為對日略予鼓勵、即可以加速日本之崩潰、並壓迫美國自太平洋全部撤退至大西洋、俾遠東可屬蘇聯所有、則在蘇聯而論、對日略予鼓勵、自屬必然也紐約時報稱、蘇日條約足使英國不徒不在新加坡駐剳大軍、據該報解釋、此為希特勒外交上之勝利、但結果或有相反之可能、紐約午報認為新約為蘇聯擬在巴爾幹有所活動之先聲、故此實為希特勒在外交上之失敗、希特勒希望對南戰事結束以後、可自巴爾幹進攻近東、新約為蘇聯對德之警告、說明蘇聯即擬改變過去之政策、在西伯利亞邊境之紅軍五十萬人、尚未至調防期間、日本似不致即將滿洲駐軍他調、此外日本在太平洋上有美國艦隊之威脅、對華戰事亦無結束之希望、此亦為日本重大之問題、華盛頓明星報認為新約對美殊為不利、新約之重要性若何、須視締約國之解釋若何暨兩方彼此之信賴若何、就表面上觀察、新約似為松岡外交上之勝利、但蘇聯對於德國在巴爾幹之勝利、顯然感覺不安、自願對日妥協、希望蘇聯在他處捲入戰禍時、日本不致攻蘇、荷華德系報紙國際新聞編輯辛姆斯認為、新約乃對美一大威脅、太平洋大戰有爆發之虞、華盛頓日報稱、倘若締約國認為彼此可於五年內不論情勢若何、均能信守條約之文字與精神、則新約誠為非常重要之條約、但兩方似僅擬於彼此有利之期間內實踐新約耳、巴爾的摩太陽報謂、倘若日本解釋新約為旨在阻止美國參戰、以為如此、即可使美國之政策趨於不致超過去年三國公約對於美國政策之影響、美國當加緊注意太平洋之局勢、但此非謂美國將停止援助英國或採取其他應付時局所必要之措置、以維護其利益與安全云、（十四日電）</p>
<h3>日蘇各項問題　尚難解決　消息報之評論</h3>
<p>莫斯科　今日消息報載稱、蘇日協定並未解決蘇日關係所有之多方面問題、不過以開闢一趨向解決之直接途徑而已、兩國漁業條約、貿易協定、及經濟問題等談判所遭遇之困難、久已著名、此種情形之發生、顯係由於正常關係之缺乏、目前兩國關係既已轉入新階段、預料必有良好之結果云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯駐法大使保證對華政策並無變更</h3>
<p>維希　可靠方面本日語合眾社稱、中國政府現正向蘇聯政府正式探詢日蘇中立公約締結後蘇聯對華之意向如何、據稱、新任蘇聯駐法大使包高莫洛夫曾向此間中國大使顧維鈞博士保證謂、蘇聯對重慶政府之態度、並無變更、且蘇聯繼續以軍用品供給中國、但消息靈通方面並不知蘇大使是否係受莫斯科方面之訓示抑僅係表示其個人之意見、法國觀察家則斷定新約有利於德蘇日三國、而係英美外交之失敗、尤其是美國云、彼等宣稱美政府已不復能希望與蘇聯締結任何協定、以使蘇美在中國亞洲東南或太平洋採取平行之政策、法方並謂日蘇德三國間之互相畏忌、已因新約而消去一大部云、（十五日合眾社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　塔斯社昨日在此間發表消息稱、蘇聯邊境衛軍、曾在亞洲邊境上、消滅武裝之越界隊伍一隊云、（十五日合眾社電）</p>
<h3>眞理報謂日已認識對蘇友好之重要性</h3>
<p>莫斯科　關於蘇日中立協定、真理報評稱、「自日俄戰爭結束迄今已三十六年矣、當時俄方敗續、簽訂朴茨茅斯條約、然則被擊敗者果非俄國、或俄國人民也、而實係不受民眾擁戴之帝俄政權耳、自此以後、日俄及日蘇之關係、至為緊張、有時且造成嚴重之武力衝突、如一九一八——一九二二年日本干涉遠東之行動、若干日本政治家強迫蘇聯接受彼等意旨之企圖、卡山湖事件及紅軍消滅進攻者諾蒙亨之役、均可顯示蘇日關係、距離正常兩個字甚遠、若干日本政治家企圖以蘇聯作為彼等侵略政策之目標、此誠大誤、良以蘇聯素以和平為職志、從不亦決不任令他人左右其政策、以致違反其本身利益也、今日所發表之中立協定及宣言、係含有極廣泛政治重要性之文件、此項文件實為兩國改善邦交之重要步驟、就此方面言、蘇日政府之願望係在增強兩國之和平及友好關係、中立協定、規定雙方保證維持友好關係、並互相尊重彼此領土之完整及其不可侵犯性、該協定同時更指定茍簽約國任何一方、成為另一或多數第二強國攻襲之目標、則另一方面、應在戰爭進行全部期內、遵守中立、蘇日共同宣言、亦極重要、該項宣言、遵循中立協定之精神、並言明互相保證尊重蒙古人民共和國及滿洲國領土之完整及不可侵犯性、此點已結束所有邊境衝突、查此項邊境衝突、非特破壞蒙滿邊境和平、且亦造成蘇日兩國間繼續不止摩擦、蘇日中立協定締結時、正值第一次世界帝國主義大戰擴展之秋、此點尤為重要、在此時期中、蘇日關係之改善及歸於正常、確係和平之重要步驟、同時與蘇聯之和平及睦鄰政策、亦完全符合、蘇日中立協定已使漁業問題等懸案獲得解決途徑、查蘇日懸案、雖含有極大之重要性、但仍被延擱、其癥結實由於蘇日間未能成立一種政洽諒解、而此種政治諒解、實係解決經濟問題之先決條件也、目前此先決條件已告獲得、而雙方政府亦誓為友好關係奮鬥、至此、以前阻止蘇日關係發展之一切障礙、乃完全消除、前日政府有時或未能瞭解對蘇友好之重要性、但目前日本政府、包括近衛及松岡均已明瞭蘇日友好關係、確係兩國繁榮及發展最重要之條件、蘇日兩國自簽訂中立協定後、已負有確實之義務、此種義務必能予以履行、因兩國之發展傾向、已使彼等必須成為良好之鄰邦、消弭一切仇視因素、及避免妨礙彼此完成歷史任務之行動也、吾人對中立協定及宣言、極表歡迎、並深信此項協定、必可造成真正之蘇日友好及和平關係、」（十五日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>英報咸認該約締結由於蘇將有事歐洲</h3>
<p>倫敦　關於蘇日成立中立條約事、曼哲斯特報導稱、蘇聯因畏懼德國、故與日本訂約、萬一德蘇間發生戰事、若日本保持中立、則對於蘇聯目極有利、惟對德國則形不利耳、若德蘇果戰、則德日兩國對於三國公約中第五條應作何解釋、則尚有問題也、蘇聯所以尤對日本保持中立</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>動盪中的國際形勢</h3>
<p>最近十幾天來，國際有比較異常的兩事　一是·德義不辭與蘇　增加磨擦，武力侵入巴爾幹；一是蘇日間雖有種種基本利害相衝突，而訂立了政治的妥協的條的。此二事，當然會影響當前及未來的國際形勢。</p>
<p>關於德義侵入巴爾幹後最値得注意的國際反響，一是各被侵國本身的態度，二是英國的表示，三是蘇，七的立塲。南希兩國的可怕犧牲與蹂躪，毅然與暴力周旋，這一點，使德義所預期的輕易戰勝，歸於泡影，造成了牠們東西兩錢作戰的形勢。英國方面，照首相邱吉爾前幾天的演說，確具不計成敗利鈍，與南希駢肩奮鬥到底的決心。這與歐非兩洲近日戰况相對照，可見英國現在漸漸偏重於歐洲方面。至於蘇土方面的反應，除去蘇聯打破向來沉默的老例，對匈牙利表示譴責外，土耳其也在邊境區域開始撒退平民；當然，蘇土並沒有堅明表示其反對德義的舉動，但與往日的態度大不相同了。把這些現象併在一處，顯示了巴爾幹的一切都在積極醞釀之中，而目前雙力在軍事上的進退，都是次要的。</p>
<p>關於蘇日簽訂所謂「中立條的」之後的國際反響，最可注意的，是締的兩方的第二步行動，其次是與蘇日有密切利害關係的中英美以及德義方面的反響。推考締的國兩方的目的，都不在於這條的的本身，而在於牠對另外一些國家態度所起的作用；至於蘇日本身之閒的基本關係，並不因這一條的而變更。而所以有此一舉者，在蘇聯方面，是對於德義向巴爾幹一帶併力東進的一種有力警告；在日本方面，要在對英美再試其恫嚇，企圖使牠們緩弛經濟上的封鎖。及政治上的壓力。然而這是無效的單想思。中國已經明白表示不承認。英美兩國似乎都以此爲不足重視，換句話說，僅僅這一紙條的，絕對不能使英美改變當前堅强立塲。至於德，義，至今還沒有什麼正面表示，然不難覘知其不安與不快。蓋這一條的，絕對小是由於德義從中促成，且與三國同盟條的，及蘇德親善關係，不相平行。</p>
<p>把所有這些反響綜合起來，可知國際形勢的整個發展裏，現在又在翻騰着相當的波瀾；而其未來的歸趨，僅此兩三天來的一些，還不能取爲估計的充實根據，諸待其他國際上許多重心因素的演變。現在可以指出來的，大概不外三個。</p>
<p>第一是蘇德的關係。假定因爲德國猛烈東進，使穌德間引起重大磨擦而正面衝突，則這些年來所醞釀着的國際反侵略集團，就可促成。蘇聯與一切正義力量携手的情形下，不獨歐洲的烽火可以很快熄滅，即連世界其他任何區域的正義力量。也很快的，就可得到了最後勝利。反過來，如果蘇聯始終接濟德國，使牠暫時不向烏克蘭進攻，則德義也許可以設法與蘇聯間不生直接衝突，而最後，則使歐洲戰亂無限延長，替蘇聯本身招致了重大危機與未來禍害。再不然，如果蘇聯取一個中間途徑，徹底斷絕對德義的援助接濟，則戰禍也就會縮短。</p>
<p>第二是美日關係。假如美國認爲蘇聯的用意，是在於促進美日衝突，而且日本確有南進的力量與勇氣，則美日在東方，必然加速的强調其行動。反過來，如果美國認爲無足重輕而日本還是觀望待變，則太平洋上的風波，終必平熄。</p>
<p>第三是中蘇關係。如果蘇聯繼續向來的援助中國政策，則目前的一切波瀾，不過都是表面泡沫，而不影響牠的主流；反過來，則國際形勢的安定，更需時日了。者、係希望日本能與美國在太平洋上發生新戰事、而德國固亦甚願見英國之同盟國能捲入新戰爭漩渦也、每日快報稱、蘇日條約僅爲日本之（窗飾），表示蘇聯已不復信任德國，若德國果行東進、則日本將不復爲助而已、蘇聯之政策無他謀有以自利耳、又新聞紀事報稱蘇聯在羣雄角逐之際、努力建設國力、將來交戰國兩敗俱傷時、蒙其利者、僅一蘇聯，而前此蘇聯固未感受德國之威脅也、乃近日德國突向巴爾幹推進、形勢突爲之一變、蘇聯欲應付歐局、亟欲保證西伯利亞之安全、今蘇聯予日本以向南太平洋推進之機會、即其所付保障西伯利亞之代價也、每日前鋒報外交訪員稱蘇日條約成立後、日本已可免去北　之憂、今後可以南進向英美挑戰矣、（十五日電）</p>

<p>在發現敵人的一刹那閒，全船官兵大家都緊張異常。年富力强的校尉們，猱升砲塔。水兵們試騐電鈴，電碼，電話，把火藥袋搬到上層的起運室中。砲手們搬運一千四百磅至二千磅重的砲彈，準備施放。引擎間中的水手，也全部守着自己的崗位。水手們行動之時，安靜而非常敏捷，緊閉不漏水的室門和艙門，把室中的燈泡都徐了下來，能移動的什物零件，都堆置地上，或緊縛起來。像鬥，椅，框架，桌子，銀器等，堆放在地板上。要是在眞芷作戰時，那末像沙發桌椅等，都得一一拋入海中。因爲艦上施放大砲時，它的回震力量非常大，木片碎塊等打在人的肉體上，其爲害比了鐵片還要大，所以作戰前非得一一把它們都淸除掉纔妥。這時候，軍艦內部除了綠色而光亮微弱的訊號燈外。全部漆黑。祇有　藏在內部的作戰參謀室，裹面充滿了各種輪盤，機械，探測瞄準器，以及開砲計算者等人，却是燈火通明。軍艦上平時充當理髮匠，厨子的，都派有作戰專職，或淸除被砲火損壞的一切殘餘。艦中各都份都各自隔絕起來，艙面上也早已淸除一空。在慘淡的綠色燈光之下，艦上的牧師步入後部救護室，等待傷兵的釗來。</p>
<p>敵驅逐艦來襲　敵人和美國兩大艦隊集合成交戰隊形，幾乎成爲平行綫。美國海軍設法把它較大而速率較遲的戰艦集合起來。在這個萬分緊張的當兒，敵海軍總指揮恃其速率較高之戰艦，擬於美海軍正在集合成隊形之頃，來一個下馬威的當頭痛擊。他的詭計，是利用驅逐艦的襲擊方法。</p>
<p>起初，他派出兩隊驅逐艦，計八艘，向後開着倒車，噴出一股墨黑的烟幕。驅逐艦隊中其餘的二十六艘，被掩護在這烟幕之後。在老遠的右角上，則有敵方的輕巡洋艦支持着作戰。霎時間，這許多條驅逐艦，以錯綜交織的密集姿態，衝出了烟幕，直向美國艦隊的陣綫撲來。美國的驅逐艦立刻出來應戰。此時敵方的輕巡洋艦向美國驅逐艦轟擊。美國的巨型巡注艦則向敵人的輕巡洋艦開砲。美國海軍防禦陣綫中的輕巡洋艦，却大大的顯出了英雄作戰的本領。它們猛烈的砲火，已把敵方的驅逐艦隊摧毀了大部份，破碎漂浮的受損艦身，沉浮於大洋之上，到處可見。</p>
<p>作戰前室內一切零星東西都除了下來</p>
<p>正在混戰之間，敵方逐驅艦隊中未被擊沉的三條船，却乘閒穿過了火綫，鼓輪而來。它們已把砲口瞄準。水雷也已經準備開放了。大的離開美國陣綫三英里之遙，它們轉舵以舷側向着美方陣綫，每條驅逐艦一排地放了八個水雷美國巨型戰艦把船身一側，並非逃開敵入，却向敵方駛去。使那危險性的水雷，從艦側滑溜過去，而不致使它們受損。敵人的進攻計劃全此已吿粉碎，他們的驅逐艦隊烟幕亦已消散。這時候美國驅逐艦和巡洋艦的進襲時機則已成熟。戰事至此，已入戰艦主力交鬥的最後階段了。（求完）</p>

<h3>怎樣研究國文（六）薛無競</h3>
<p>（五）寫作應注意之點閱讀是材料的吸收、寫作是思想的發表、大概閱讀一多、鬱積於中，自然會由情感及理智中流露出一些文章來、茲將注意之點、分述於下、</p>
<p>（甲）寫字是人的外表、雖談不到什麼蠅頭小楷、簪花妙格、然而最要的、第一是正確、第一是整齊、第三是迅速、凡破體·簡筆·潦草·均要力忌、而音同義異、如辨·辯·辮·形似義異、如羸·嬴·贏、均須一一分別認淸、不可下筆便錯、萬一有誤、即另製一正誤表、時時加以檢點、出而應世、便綽有餘裕了、（乙）作　作文之道、一是用字、二是造句、三是謀篇、文法不可錯誤、辭句須要淸通、再進而求其音節和諧、修辭美麗、而最要的還是描寫動人、情感眞摯、思想高尙、至於典故的運用、宜淺不宜深、宜通俗不宜冷僻、文體的練習、由純熟而巧妙、由慕擬而創造、雖超矩矱之外、而常在格律之中、遝用之妙、在乎一心、那就盡爲文之能事了、講到發表的機會、命題作文、原是對初學而言、如果思想已漸成熟的人、那就作剳記也好、作日記也好、隨時隨地、加以觀察、只要情動乎中、自會形之於外、其他如集合同志、硏究文藝、限期報吿心得、興趣如能提高、作文的泉源、自然滔滔汨汨、如長江大河、有一瀉千里之勢、</p>
<p>六·工具</p>
<p>工欲善其事、必先利其器、國文的利器、是說文·辭源·和字典、自從漢代許叔重編了一部說文、才把造字的源流、六書的體例、形聲義的區別、原原本本、詳加解釋、道是一部文字學的奇書、縱起而作說文的人、不知凡幾、其中以段氏（玉裁）說文、王氏（筠）說文句讀、及朱氏（駿聲）說文通訓定聲、都是不朽之作、要想深人國文堂奧的人、當然有涉獵的必要、就是最低的限度、也要先看一部文字蒙求、才瞭然於字之來歷、不致模糊影嚮、望文生義了、字典的編纂、以言內容的豐富、莫過於康熙字典、以言檢查的迅速、莫過於王雲五四角號碼的字典、均應人人一部、留置案頭、以便翻閱、而出典之考查、始有辭源、繼有辭通、終有辭海、人所皆知、母庸我再贅言、</p>
<p>七·修養</p>
<p>我敎了二十年的國文、除了中人之資的學生外、而最佳之子弟、一是犬才橫逸、下筆成章、一是劬學深思、點鐵爲金、這兩種人、往往分道揚鑣、不可兼得、我現在拈出修養二字、正是要把他們鍾鍊成一片、入手處就是要博覽古今的書籍、考察人羣的動態、觀其通、扼其要、使得情操豐富、理智深沉、人格高尙、那就長言之、短言之、六轡在手、控縱自如、才可以登峯造極、成一出類拔萃之人、試覜沒有岳武穆的義憤、那裏會有滿江紅、沒有王充的才思、那裏會有論衡、而子輿之壯闊、寄托於孟子、仲尼之偉大、表現於論語、眞正有志於國文深造的人、並非打兩句古文的腔調、寫一套幽默諷刺的文章、就可以算得你是一位卓越千古的文豪、滿養你的性情、捉高你的人格、從至性中流露出來的文章、才是千秋萬世的盛業呢、（完）</p>

<h3>糧食　米價狂漲竟難稍平　米糧新到又有十萬餘包　囤虎操縱依然肆無忌憚</h3>
<p>洋米昨市、初站繼落、終又伏、結果雖比前日午市見漲一二元、然比之前日晚市則反小半元至一元也、當晨間開市時、承前日漲風、買氣依然活潑、各檔洋米售價一致漲達前日晚市　盤之髙價、一號西貢立時開價至一百二十二元、二號及小絞至一百十八元半、其他各米無不上升、比之前日午市較大二三元、然價昂後　銷已呆、且種種問人自擾之謠諑、亦經證實無足介意、新囤觀望、浮多既有七八元一石之厚利、樂得乘機脫手、市乃即午刻回小二元、惟至下午又被囤老虎借謠言激刺、買氣又見濃厚、各米售價再漲一元半、結果雖呈挺站之象而行情終比前晚為低、英華司回籠米開一號西貢一百三十七八元、碎米一百十二元半至一百十一元、小絞一百四十元至一百四十一元半、成交約一千五百噸、現洋米一萬五千包、</p>
<p>米老虎猖狂之勢不衰、掃墓節開關後橫漲暴騰、</p>
<p>殊駭聽聞、但觀洋米仍有大量到埠、　賜洋行席拉斯Therese　Maller號馬勒輪、由仰光運來大批洋米計五千餘噸約有五萬五千包之鉅、前日（十四日）傍晚抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧起缷、又中通公司經理之Essi號輪、由海防道接運來洋米一萬六千零二十九包、昨晨進口停靠浦東隆茂碼頭起缷、太古公司太原輪亦於昨晨到滬、由香港裝來洋米五千二百六十五包、停法租界本行碼頭起缷、怡和洋行裕生輪昨日下午到埠、亦由香港運來洋米二千六百五十一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭、昨晚連夜起缷、</p>

<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨轉稀、所以貨主售心更堅、續在扳俏、而銷場方面亦以價盤已較洋米價廉、店舖納胃仍暢、是以厚薄兩粳價　能增髙二元之譜開常幫清坯真特粳斛見百二十八元、特粳百二十六元、崑山斛見特粳百二十五元、次之百二十元、青角斛見薄稻百十七元、糥米早市見洋米繼呈漲風、曾相隨一度帶緊、惟後亦跟踪回疲、結果一升一降、適成定局、所開各價與前相仿、</p>
<h3>洋粉漲風稍戢</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉漲風稍戢、蓋自泰國統制食米出口、及蘇日訂約、市價激升頗速、各貨行情均已躍出三十元關外、惟有一部分踢皮球買賣、獲利散戶、稍有了結、故市面欲漲乏力、花鳥牌澳粉回鬆至三十元〇五角、金龍牌坎粉由三十元〇三角降至三十元、比前回小二三角、堪稱大漲小回、　廠平　粉照常二十五元、惟廠方以原料不足、將有停供之說、刻正在設法中、</p>
<p>麵粉大量出口、有麵粉八萬五千包、裝大古公司涼州輪、今日運往天津、又有二萬二千包、裝漢陽輪、今午出口、運往廈門上項運出之麵粉、均屬澳貨、昨日渣華公司芝比沙號輪、昨午抵滬、自爪哇裝來麥子一千包、現停浦東藍烟囱起缷、（祖）</p>
<p>小麥　尚不脫堅靜之局、按內地杜麥供源久枯、偶有零星到貨、為數甚微、大都被日廠方面收去、價仍在四十五六元之間、市場買資、依然無形停頓、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆苞米　實銷不起</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆苞米市面、因實銷不旺、計苞米下瀉元許、成交現貨一千三四百包、（行情詳市價欄）、期貨二百五十噸、黃豆妥成千許包、豆油先跌後平、做開大連現油五百桶、價自一百五十四元至五十六元、訂四月下交一千餘桶、價自一百五十四元半、跌至五十三元半、旋升至五十六元二角半、後為五十五元七角半、又成交烟岐油五十件、價為一百零三元、花生油平平、計開膠州油二百件、價為一百十九元、江北本坊聽裝油五百餘廳、一百六十元至一百六十一元、豆餅亦無甚變遷、市先堅後平定、實銷略有點綴、投機仍占多數、統計做開期現各餅一萬三四千片、</p>
<p>十六日豆子出口、運廈門六百七十包、運香港二百十包、又生油運香港一千聽、又二百四十件、</p>
<h3>證券　內債一時難好</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、經過四天休假後、昨日照常開市、因環境上變化稍有出入、如日蘇訂定中立條約、雖無關大局、究與中國多少受其影響、因此人心極為鬆軟、更以多方後又暫行住手、一瀉幾及元許、午後因多方又有大量　胃、乃又回上數角、目下行市、本因前數日裕興代售出之領　滿期貨、為數可觀、一般多方已感滿足、致　方漸覺無力、前途暫時尚無正式好面、昨日經過、上午開盤即小、恒孚　出甚湧、協康久豐賣出亦極踴躍、散戶亦出多進少、買方同康怡泰較為熱鬧、潤和協　　及鼎康買進亦不弱、午收仍屬賣方佔優勢、比前小去數角至一元、午後同康仍有大量進　約五十萬、怡泰進量亦強震昌順昌及聯益買進亦不弱、雖震康聯和同順和豐等賣出、而行市仍被抬髙數角、結果行市僅小三四角至六角不等、成交總數共計約二百十餘萬九、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實業社股五十股、價為二十四元正、</p>
<p>眾業股市開盤、價格暴落、嗣即逐步回堅、市況轉形活潑、成交極盛、下午收盤、雖較晨開價尚髙、趨勢復告軟化</p>
<h3>金融　洋行趁賤時　猛結進口匯票</h3>

<p>投機賣轉穩</p>
<p>後市初定、嗣因國外消息利空、投機家即起賣意、本月份美滙五元三一二五想塞、而外行則扳持五元三四三七五、故市面微現鬆動、三時後華行前來收吸、狀態　平、計吃過本月份美匯五元三一二五、結果現期收盤英金均告三便士二三四三七五、美滙俱為五元二八一二五、較假前英緊零一五六二五、美　零三一二五、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價、期現俱漲、英美金鎊、因亦各升二元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票呆定如故、市價站平角七分、繼而步髙至四角半、午收四角、午後舉行第一屆掉期、聞買方貼予賣方為七分、故匯市雖較上午為鬆、而美票則髙至十八元四角六分收盤、比假前軋升一角、香港票需要旺盛、市價挺漲、日金票趨勢堅挺、晚市髙至一元九角九分、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍站一元七角一分原盤、</p>
<h3>紗花　港銷活躍　紗市扶搖直上　雙馬近一千五百元關</h3>
<p>假後之紗市、突然上騰、此因港幣對於雙馬紗需要繼續暢旺、同時申新廠對於棧租問題、業已解決、自四月十五日起每包僅加三元計算、於是多頭安定、於大局無關輕重、加之外匯稍縮、標金昂升、皆使多方活躍、因之買風　　、市盤乃扶搖直上、二十支雙馬髙價為一千四百九十四元、低價為一千四百三十二元、午後初做一千四百九十四元、升至九十七八元、回下至一千四百八十一二元、旋以大戶拖進、復升至一千四百九十一二元、目前紗市、因四二支紗價太髙、與雙馬價距離太遠、所以有收進者、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人氣平平、因上日消息、蘇日已訂中立條約、多頭了結、首盤價為一千四百四十五元、此盤一開、賣者紛紛、但市場秩序紊亂、叫喊進出聲不一、即降至一千四百三十二元、旋後市情忽變、謂標金價好、買勢陡熾、直升至一千四百六十元、在此價略有往返、繼聞廣幫採辦甚健、雙馬一牌買去二千包、現紗市價頻頻前進、人心一致向上、於是盤子越開越髙、直達至一千四百九十四元、惟有一部份盈利者吐出、微回至一千四百九十八元收盤、查　日間成交總計一萬一千包、又棉紗今有十二件、運往香港、又三件運往廈門、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港三、〇〇〇同行八、〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計一一、〇〇〇</p>
<h3>最近雙馬紗　猛晉之原因</h3>
<p>殊久之二十支雙馬紗、最近幾天、忽然飛騰、茲將昂升之素因列左、</p>
<p>（一）在封關前、人心大都轉向看好、因為廠方增收棧租問題、尚未明瞭、謹慎者一律了結、以免四日之風險、所以由一千四百五十五元跌至一千四百三十一元、</p>
<p>（二）上日報載蘇日已訂中立條約、市價當然看壞、豈料外匯復縮、條子上漲、且四二支綫價已售二千六百元、予雙馬價相差一千一百元外、復以近來布疋銷路暢盛售價有漲無跌、至於原料亦不鬆落、投機者對於澹泊之變馬、興緻突然濃厚、收買者紛至前來、市盤乃直綫上騰、</p>
<p>（三）昔日因雙馬紗存貨　積、廠方為推動減輕存貨、獎勵出口起見、南洋需要大為興奮、本日又有成交二千包之說、加以增收棧租問題已解決、僅收三元、廠方為節約電力、減工一層舊事重提、市場上議論下來、二十支紗比較獨廉、那末投機買風一鼓而來、所以市價直升、</p>
<p>（四）　以前多數心理為雙馬價太髙、買進雜牌、掉出雙馬、因之場中空額變馬較夥、近來雜牌紗既提髙、又不能套出、雙馬形勢一緊、空頭又起惶恐而扒補、由此多方狂喊、要到一千五六百元、不足為奇、根本問題、還在實際銷路上着想、南洋方　出口量、是否源源而不斷也、</p>
<h3>花價上騰　細絨漲勢尤銳</h3>
<p>現棉情況、隨紗市而升騰、四二支原料猛昂十七元之譜、因雙股綫價已售二千六百元外、廠方盈利奇昂、所以對於原料方面亦願出價收買、然市上現貨單薄、因之人心尤挺、至於二十支原棉、受印度棉關係、漲勢較為和緩、然二十支紗價前途看好、唇齒相依之原棉、當然跟踪而抬頭矣、照此成交興奮、市價步步上升、昨日紗廠及花號互做共計二千三百四十五件、又五百包、價漲五元至十元、茲將成交現棉行市列左、</p>
<p>米得林　四　〇永安　四　〇件送廠</p>
<p>米得林　三九五同行　一〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>米得林　三九九協同興一〇〇件棧交</p>

<p>火機草包二〇六　豐　二〇〇　棧交</p>
<p>火機劃包二〇七　豐　三〇〇　棧交</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因各方奮起競購而市況活躍、蓋國際風雲漸呈緊急、海外採購頗感困難、因之連日紗市突飛猛進、客幫皆爭力購進、以便轉運銷售、於是棉市亦　之進入熱鬧狀態、不論同業廠方、皆有大批採辦之意向也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、活潑而堅定、因有同業購買、及現貨商買進而漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日挺進六至十三磅因不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進而漲、旋因棉商套賣而跌、但最後再因投機者買進而漲、昨日收盤價格、除平　　低落三　比外、其餘各漲二三　比不等、又預測今日開盤市況看髙二　比弱、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布髙昂</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢堅昂、同業心思看髙、各貨售盤一費漲五角至一元、色布·色斜漲近一元、漂布府綢囤戶吸收、每疋亦漲五角至七角半、本街成交各布一千餘件、客路粵港滇幫辦華豐一九〇士林布二羊嘩嘰粗布斜紋等貨三百餘件、　　等地辦漂布·粗布·香港布等貨一百數十件、十六日疋頭運廈門二十件、運香港一千四百二十五件、</p>
<p>東布　晨漲午回、結果續升、白貨龍頭細布上午髙峯升至五十二元二角半、下午低盤見五十一元七角半、收盤續昂、為五十一元八角半、較封關前每疋漲四角半、四君子嗶嘰一元五角五分、八七五每碼漲二分七釐半、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白邁步進</h3>
<p>昨糖市初甚堅昂、中途稍見回鬆、最後復向髙峯邁進、公會劃盤、期貨粗白本月二十日打單初為九十元零二角、一角、旋由九十元、微鬆至八十九元九角、八角、九角、更由九十元升至九十元〇四角、升七角、本月底劃開盤九十一元、一元一角、一元、九十元〇九角、八角、七角、八角、六角半、七角、八角、九角　後稍緊為九十一元、一元二角、一元、至九十元〇九角、升四角、荷赤　平、為六十八元五角至三角、太古事白升三五角、B嘜西棧九十二元半、DY嘜八十五元三角、HX嘜西棧八十五元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　興化桂圓</h3>
<p>散戶時有脫售</p>
<p>興化桂圓、邇來乏到、但市上散戶客貨不欲久守、漸有鬆出、如興化四元之類時有脫售、較之前盤、又小十餘元不一、其餘雜路貨當然未能樂觀、大約在焙汛前、或須再開一小部份、價可續鬆云、</p>
<h3>從按月發薪改為分期發薪</h3>
<p>— 鄭世賢</p>
<p>本市生活費指數，髙到了興戰前一與六·八之比。一般恃薪水為活的人，難其收入，較戰前多少有些增加，但其增加數額的比例，絕對趕不上生活費激增的程度。所以今日一般薪水階級的生活困苦的情形，確有非豐衣足食者所能意想得到的。在此種情形下，除了各廠店行號當局，顧念職工生活原困苦，僅可能的增加職工薪工或津貼外，我覺得還有一個辦法，有助於薪水階級經濟的調度與支配，值得各廠店行號採行的，那便是改良發薪制度。</p>
<p>我國工商界，於職工薪水，向以月計。發放之期，亦多在月杪或月初。這在前幾年，物價低，開繳省，一個普通薪水階級的家庭，每月支出，不過二，三十元至百元左右。數目較少，調度較易。但到了今天，（未完）</p>

<h3>工潮蠭起攸關治安　勞資應接受調解　茂昌眼鏡公司昨被搗毀　水木業工潮定日內調處</h3>
<p>警務當局決取締聚衆滋事越軌行動</p>
<p>米償有漲無落、煤球燃料一切實用品、無不一再漲價、本市工人生活、遂岌岌可危、旬日以來、米價煤球價益漲、以致已頻解決之工潮、又　不可遏止、自水木業罷工後、以該業工人人數極夥、關於社會安寗綦鉅、形勢，趨嚴重、其他各業勞資糾紛、當局尙在磋議調解中、迄今罷工者全市已數禺人、資方一再讓步、盼勞方在最低限度之可能情形下、接受調解、以維秩序、至聚衆滋事、强迫行動、兩租界警務方面、決加取締、</p>
<p>搗毀茂昌眼鏡公司</p>
<p>南京路雲南路口茂昌眼鏡公司　店門市部、於昨日下午三時十分、忽被別家眼鏡製造工人、糾衆闖入、搗毀生財等物、致一度發生紛擾、當即恢復秩序、照常營業、其事緣本市眼鏡業應製鏡片工人、近因生活維艱、向資方耍求增加工資未遂、於本月六日起實行罷工、迄未解決、惟一部分同業勞資感情融洽、未曾參加、茂昌眼鏡公司、亦爲其中之一、乃有六七十人、於昨日下午三時許許、至該公司、不問情由、用石塊及木棒等、將沿南京路及雲南路之大玻璃窗六扇、及櫥窗內大批貨物搗毀一空、其時老閘捕房因近在咫尺、已接得報吿、立派大批探捕驅車到塲彈壓、肇事者見探捕到來、即紛粉作鳥獸散、結果被捕工人二十餘人、並將割斷之電話、一併帶人捕房偵訊、候今晨解送法院訴究、聞茂昌公司此决損失甚鉅、不下數千金、</p>
<p>沙遜系旅業仍怠工沙遜系華懋飯店·華懋大厦·都城飯店·及漢彌爾登大厦·等工潮、昨日形勢又擴大、各該旅社之膳食部侍役、亦已加入怠工、以致各旅客不得不另至他處就食、而資方態度、叉復甚爲堅決、故一時甚難獲得解決希望、據其總經理人奥伐第昨稱、關於各該旅社職工罷工一事、對於工人有何要求、現尙茫然不知、蓋工人迄今尙未有正式要求提出也、昨日兩飯店之電梯司機、亦加入怠工、於是二飯店之電梯司機、由白俄代替維持、</p>
<p>怠工原委</p>
<p>據華懋飯店華懋公寓都城公寓漢密爾登大厦工人聲述罷工原委稱、「我們道一班在華懋公司工作、都有很久歷史、大多數從開店到現在、平常對於工作方面、都是非常地盡職、所以勞資兩方、能够融洽到現在、値茲非常時期、生活程度日日增高、而我們的工資、只有二十六元、另加米貼三十餘元、總共不過六十元左右、並且在一月之中、只有三星期的工作、還有一星期是空班、在空班期內、工資和米貼一律扣除、在此物價高漲的今日、這些微少的數目、怎樣能維持我們的生活、所以我們在前數月、會向資方當局請求加薪、未獲資方的允准、決議申請資方本勞資互惠的精神、允許四條件、</p>
<p>四項條件</p>
<p>（一）薪金在三十五元以下者、加百分之百、在三十五元以上者、加百分之七十五、（按照本年三月份薪金計算）（二）不得藉故開除及裁退職工、並恢復被裁職員工作、（三）臨時生活津貼二十元（包括煤貼在內、）（四）米貼照舊一斗半、全體推派代表、持函懇請資方當局予以誠意答覆：乃一概不予接受、我們不堪資方壓迫、被逼全體離職、靜候資方給我們公允的答覆、以上的情形、是我們經過的事實，」</p>
<p>水木工潮卽日洽商</p>
<p>本市水木業工人、人數以萬計、原分兩租界及閘北兩部、工資微有高下、木工較泥工低一角、自滬市生活飛漲後、已經普加米貼、此决所提要求、業經資方允准增加百分之九十、乃有一部份工人、以爲資方所加工資、不足維持生計、强迫罷工、以致工潮逐漸擴大、該會業經分別呈請工部局公董局備案澈查、現在全市建築工程悉陷停頓狀態、傳今日勞資將再接洽、</p>
<p>搬塲公司今日復工</p>
<p>茂泰·上海·兩搬塲公司司機小工的八百名、前因要求增加工資不遂、於十日罷工後、茲悉由司機工會孫連山·劉永福·徐項城等三人及勞方代表錢　·唐根發等、會　資方代表王友堂、於十五日下午五時談判後、業已獲得圓滿解決、資方除接受八項條件外、並允罷工期內工資照給、故勞方巳定今日上午全體　工、聞太平·中國·永安·上天·等四家資方、仍未接受談判、故工潮仍難解決、</p>
<p>大東煙廠復工困難</p>
<p>赫德路八三七號大東烟廠、於本年一月閒、因所有爐灶陳舊不能應用、故計劃一律換新、惟在停業期間、每日由廠方發給津貼六角、始於本月一日全部裝竣、於八日起開始工作、旋於本月十三日、該廠切烟部男女工友數十名、向廠方提出加薪要求九條、惟廠方以目前並未工作、故對勞方所提要求、表示絕無考慮餘地</p>

<p>日僑亦願局勢轉好</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今晨（十五日）工部局某職員對記者稱工部局所建議之新組織已獲得日方附議、，故公共租界之全部局勢、將有好轉之希望、而蘇州河北區、或將重歸於工部局能轄之下、以此閒日籍居民、願見上海之恢復正常狀態、其熱誠不亞於其他各國僑民、故不久之將來、現狀之調整、頗屬有望、</p>
<p>北區警權尚未解決</p>
<p>聞三浦建議之一、擬將虹口區另設一警區、以日籍警官一名爲主任、而以英籍警官副之、而仍隸屬於警務處管轄之下、當時此項談判進行、頗爲順利、其後談判又吿中止、結果自去年八月以來、迄未作第二度之討論、同時、據悉公用事業機關、如上海電車公司等、曾向日當局要求准許收回公共租界北區之電車行駛權、目下蘇州河北區由「華中公　汽車」二百八十輛載客行駛、該項公共汽車、旣無特許權、亦未向工部局繳納照會費、且此種公共汽車之駕駛、並未領有駕駛執照、遇有車輛肇禍等事、彼等每視法律如弁髦、而此種公共汽車之乘容、常受辱駡、除此以外、尙有求捐照會之自由車、在公共租界北區行駛、且自由車與黃包車夫時有在途上發生爭吵冲突之事、妨碍交通、而日當局均視若無覩也、</p>
<h3>猛抬物價危害治安　密查已告竣事　俟局勢平靜後依法處治　前昨又到洋米十一萬包</h3>
<p>本市因環境特殊、不顧平民生計、及社會治安者、一味肆虐市塲、猛抬物價、米煤允甚、殊堪令人心痛、惟各類物價、卒被若輩頻頻抬高、迭見新高峯、茲向關係方面探悉、當局關懷全滬中外居民生計、至殷至切，雖曾三令五申、抑平物價、及敦勸商人顧全大局、勿擅抬物價、卒因若輩秉性難改、陽奉陰違、爲懲戒起見、自經開船密查以還、頃已吿完全就緒、正式入　　　聞　至　當　機、決將依法嚴厲懲辦、</p>
<p>米市謠戢昨尚平靖</p>
<p>米市塲管理委員會、於昨日下午、假米行公會舉行談話會、對疏通來源、穩定市塲營業、及抑平米價數點、曾作精審之商討、但仍未作若何決定、據悉本市米業團體、刻正靜候兩租界當局頒佈取締投機穩定米市之各項辦法、俾資遵行、據悉本市目前華洋各米糧堆棧存貨數額、爲二年來最充實之時期、况現今因米價翔貴、一般平民以購糶麵粉、或其他雜糧替代裏腹、故每日米糧去路、顯已無前之浩繁、按諸眼前情形而言、存米決不至减尠、倘無作祟、則民食恐慌不難迎刃而解、故當局之澈查存米、懲辦米蠹、殊不容再緩、昨日米市塲開做後、因證實謠言無稽、人心已趨安定、國洋米糧漲跌互見、</p>
<p>兩日到米十餘萬包</p>
<p>本市米價高漲不已、平民生計堪虞近日當局處置一般團戶起見、有澈查堆淺、限期出售、吾則予以嚴申處荊等情、平民得聞之後、對當局如此措處非常滿意、並表感戴、認爲米價有回落之希望、不料報章宣布後、非但不能回落、反形上漲、以致大爲失望、查洋米來源、大量接踵進口、前昨兩日洋米到埠、共十一萬三千餘包之鉅、故對米價依舊高漲之原理、無法推測</p>

<h3>日在江灣東北　訓練降落傘兵　衆信此係日圖擴張徵象　日軍一聯隊近過滬他調</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（十四日）午後三時至四時三十分、本市上空有日方新式巨型運輸飛機三十架、參與降落傘兵演習、此乃日方謀擴張之微象、但向何方擴張、尙未可知，演習時、市中心區以北與向浦東方面天空中、有許多日陸軍士兵皆張降落傘而下、江灣東北面之日方大飛機塲則禁止閒人觀望、然日方傘兵自驅逐機與戰鬥機護送之運輸機躍出、已顯見該區有何活動矣、</p>
<p>如何配備無法獲悉</p>
<p>日機約飛至一萬呎高空、傘兵始從飛機躍下、在公共租界邊界遠眺、未能獲見傘兵是吾携有步槍或機關槍等特別配備、據該處附沂鄕民入公共租界後謂、彼等見狀、頗感驚詫、風向轉變、「汽球」東飄、若干「汽球」似有墜入浦江之虞云、惟彼等未知有無喪生情事、該區並無射擊傘兵人民防隊、自不待言、</p>
<p>大批日機襲浙贛</p>
<p>查日來公共租界上空所見大批日轟炸機乃往襲擊寗波乍浦與江西省內之華軍者、觀察者見日機携有諒係二百五十磅之炸彈達十五枚之多、滬寗鐵路一帶來訊、傳日軍若干聯隊、刻正開來上海區、</p>
<p>日軍一隊倉卒他調</p>
<p>又據本市可靠消息、日軍一聯隊開抵楊樹浦兵營僅二十四小時、即登船他調、據日文每日新聞載稱、自去年十月以後、毫無生氣堅守緘默之蘇聯駐滬總領事館、刻爲加强在遠東外交陣錢計、將於本月內再開、當去年九月駐日蘇聯大使館曾派佛托克里斯基秘密來滬、與留滬蘇領館職員謝里科夫。柏其的爾金及其他關係工作人員屢次會談後、即決定再開、本年佛氏又再度來滬、經與該館留滬人員作具體協議後遂決定於該館下設總務·護照·司法·商務·新聞五科、由莫斯科方面派遣五人、東京蘇聯大使館派遣五名、及留滬人員的十名共同組織、現因鑒於遠東情勢之轉變、故爲增强遠東蘇聯外交機構計、遂定於本月中旬冉開、留滬人員計爲庫里米科·阿爾庫斯·謝里科夫·伊瓦恩基焉科等、去處不詳、昨日午後、跑馬廳觀衆雲集、參觀跑馬、忽聞飛機軋軋聲、咸昂首上視、見日機二十七架、隊形緊密、後隨另一隊日機、亦係二十七架、相率飛過、</p>
<p>衆信德人　從事教練</p>
<p>又英文大美晚報云、日陸軍運輸機今（十五日）晨續在江灣區舉行降落傘演習、若干人士相信日軍不久或將仿德蘇陸軍之方法、而用傘兵對華軍作戰、今日與前三日來、皆有大批日軍運輸機轟炸機與驅逐機飛行於上海天空、衆信日機飛行之主要原因、在訓練此間日軍成傘兵隊、一般人又信德方「敎練」數人刻正協助日軍進行傘兵練習、</p>

<h3>各有巧妙不同</h3>
<p>— 陳鑫奎</p>
<p>作文有「筆法」，打仗有「槍法」，那末大商人做賣買，豈可沒有「漲法」？</p>
<p>「漲法」很多，並且法法高明，已經實騐而生效的，有下面的種種：</p>
<p>穩紮穩打法——今天漲一分，等兩天漲兩分，然後跌一分，再漲兩分，如是步步高升，或者退一步進兩步，不消兩個月，即漲上了兩三角。例如食油，從七角左右到一元餘，就是這般漲起來的。</p>
<p>漲貨不漲價法——價錢日慢增漲，貨色先行减少，如此和漲價有異曲同工之妙。譬如草紙吧，買一刀回來，老是覺得張數縮了些，原來便是出的這個花樣。</p>
<p>次貨應市法——上等貨鎖好了等待善價脫手，先拿决貨當上等貨賣出去，價錢仍舊，這樣有漲價的實惠，無漲價的惡名。這一類敎訓，凡是出頭號米價錢購食一號米的人們，諒必都已領敎得够了。</p>
<p>欲漲反跌法——漲呀漲呀，漲得糊裏糊塗，簡直連自己也不相信了。果然漲足之後，生意也不對了，那就轉個灣吧，發發善心，今朝落下一點點，明朝落下一點點，三日五日之後，就誘動了投商人的心腸，忙着來「扒啊」「吸啊」了，於是價鈿快快重行增漲。道樣，店主得意，因爲父漲着了；投機商人也得意，囚爲他料定該貨必定耍回漲的；　有小市民羣挺倒霉，買一日，貴一日。像刻下的肥皂火柴等物，無不充分的表現着這種姿態。</p>
<p>連跑帶跳法——說也奇怪，漲風開，生意反而大好，喜得老闆們笑口常開，到了這個地步，文縐縐一成成的漲價，業已不合乎時　的需要，祗好連跑帶跳的迎頭趕去了。請看美金票的價格，兩月內雖常在十八元上下盤旋，而美孚油的零售價，每聽則由十七八元飛躍到了二十三四元，這般淸楚的例子，還不够明白嗎？</p>
<p>大漲特漲法——漲了還要漲，還要漲，但是輿論不容，人言可畏，不能不用一層烟　，於是乎先佈成緊張空氣，又造個大大的謠言，而後扭扭揑揑的來一套啟事，樣樣準備舒齊，立即展開聯合陣錢，「橫」字當頭，發個狠勁，放大膽量，管它娘的漲上去！反正一樣要挨駡的，漲就漲它一個不折不扣，拾拾足足！像這種漲法，非大本錢營業不可，自然僅有米呀煤呀，才够得到這般資格哩。</p>
<p>此外，還有「改訂價目法」，「團結漲價法」，「叫苦連天法」，「要錢不要命法」，和「什麼什麼法」與「一切一切法」……大商人的「漲法」無窮，鄙人的「肚才」小廣，而此地的篇幅有限，那裏寫得盡許多。好在窮人也有「法」，此「法」曰「强賒硬買法」信不信過　便知。</p>

<p>大報光榮史，高文黼繡張，筆花開上座，靈爽寄新堂，揭幕神如在，搞詞澤共長，跫晉今絕響，遺愛夢鐙凉。</p>
<p>良辰感逝</p>
<p>永慨成今日，長眠負好春，前　江燕語，殘夢海漚身，遠浦難爲別　彌天補欲眞，黯然千古　，吹淚滿風巾</p>
<h3>蜀中來鴻</h3>
<p>— 書生</p>
<p>—告訴你一些生活情形—</p>
<p>川中舊貨商店的營業最發達，都是跟着需要應運而生的。物價貴得驚人，一般薪給人員，新貨買不起，只有到舊貨商店裏去找他所需要的東西。於是到處都是道種舊貨舖。半年之內，成都開出了七十幾家，樂山在兩個月內開出了十幾家。這是不化本錢的生錢的買賣，有舊貨的人，寄托舊貨店代售，店主在脫售之後，賺一筆較大的扣頭。這種店的營業，家家賺錢，但是以後都要陸續關門了，一則這種店太多了，二則從前在下江帶來的物件，現在减少了；郵寄物也减少了；舊貨缺乏無法營業了。</p>
<p>兩年前我在樂山化五十元購一套章華灰色嗶嘰西裝，穿了兩年，褲後臀部快要洞穿，最近寄在舊貨商店求售，結果是售洋兩百十元，被扣手續費一成，實得一百八十九元，白穿了兩年反而賺了一百四十元。然而做這套衣服的時候，這里的米賣六分錢一斤，化五十塊錢可以買八百三十四斤米；現在五十元變成了一百八十九元，這是何等大的利息，然而以目前每石二百六十元的米價計算，郤只能買到一百二十七斤米，反而虧了七百零七元。</p>
<p>初到樂山的時候，理髪只要八分錢，洗澡只要兩角錢。去年十一月理髪與洗澡還都只要五角，現在呢，單剪髪三元，搽黃凡士林另加六角，搽白凡士林另加一元，洗頭另加一元，敲背另加一元，搽花露永雪花膏再加一元。單洗澡五元，擦背另加五元，擦全身另加十元，扦脚再加六元，冷水如要炭火取暖，另加三元。相隔短短四月，變化如此之大。我理髮本來每月兩决，現在只好改四十天一决，洗澡本來每星期一次，以後亦只好永遠不去了。大學敎授不如手藝人和苦力。</p>
<p>然而除了薪水階級，其餘的人，他們理髮·洗澡·吸香烟·上菜館，都還是和以前一樣，毫無吝色，滿不在乎。最最氣人的是做衣服：西裝裁縫店主的顧客，現在都是些不三不四的下層階級，六百元一套，八百元一套，一千元一件大衣，聽憑裁縫老闆開口，幾乎連價都不計較；而白面書生近於絕跡，要想添置也只好到寄賣社去買舊貨。我的一位助教和一個寗波裁縫合開的西服店，現在每月盡縣六千元，以全年計，每人可凈賺三萬兀。</p>
<p>商人請客，動輒以大砲台香烟敬客，大大砲台在這里現在賣三十六元一聽，我們這里二百多敎職找不到一個吸大英牌的了，只能吸那辛辣無比的土產旱烟了·（三月十七日信）</p>
<h3>有人什焚燒鈔票</h3>
<p>— 中及</p>
<p>不1嗎？有許多人在焚燒鈔票。雖然他們很窮。</p>
<p>她們或是他們，把一張張的鈔票，燃着火，燒成灰，灰在空中飛，好似一雙雙的粉蝶。於是笑了，好似做了一件快慰的事。</p>
<p>一刀杭箔，至少要一元二角錢，每刀九十張計算，每張的値國幣一分三厘。</p>
<p>隔壁的老太太，昨晚買了六盒用錫箔摺成的「元寳」。我暗暗地替她計算，每只「元寳」的合國幣二分許。</p>
<p>不是嗎！有許多人在燒鈔票。不知道，誰留下的鬼話：「焚燒後的錫箔是鬼用的錢幣。」</p>
<p>淸明時節，焚燒鈔票的人更多。只見這邊烟，那邊烟，粉蝶飛滿了天。我猜不透，這是什麼心理？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 泰瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）　愛情結晶品</p>
<p>當他受了好幾個前輩同行的迫促，老遠趕到瀋陽去唱一决堂會戲的時候，預算距離湘綺臨盆的日子，已祇差三四十天工夫了，孩子的問題，日夜在他心頭縈繫着，上了台，再也不用想打起精神唱戲，一齣四五花洞，別人都拼命的冒上，他自己却險些連詞兒都忘掉，幾乎不能下台。</p>
<p>在瀋陽住了五天，別人都興高采烈的往各處去亂跑，他却統共祇上日本地去了一次。</p>
<p>臨走的一天早上，金大個子和榮奎等一干人全上街去買東西了，秋海棠却獨自留在旅館裹，沒精打采的躺在床上出神；也不知道經過了多少時候，才突然發覺屋子裏已來了一個人</p>
<p>「這幾天我瞧你心事在上，一直倒忍不住要來見你「見了！」說話的就是趙玉崑，剃着光頭，敞着衣襟，說話很乾脆，行動又輕快，又沒有聲息；半年多不見，什麼都不曾改變，祇是今天時候還早，臉上居然例外的找不到一絲醉容。</p>
<p>「啊！是你？」這倒不是秋海棠所預料得到的，心裏頓時就高興了許多。</p>
<p>「不是我是誰啊？」說着，他照例又扮了一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>「這樣說起來，這幾天堂會裏的那個草上飛，一定就是你了！」秋海棠立刻從床上蹦了起來，歡天喜地的拉着玉崑的手說：「你這個人也眞古怪，打天津一走，居然闖到關外來了。這是什麼一會事啊？」</p>
<p>「什麼一會事？吿訴你吧！要吃飯！」玉崑瞧他一站起來，便自己躺了下去。「你要問我爲什麼改了這個名字，那還不是和你把吳玉琴三個字改成秋海棠一個樣兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「我瞧你倒還混得不差吧？」秋海棠也不和他客套，便自己拉通一張椅子來，靠着床沿坐了（八二）</p>

<h3>「洪宣嬌」觀後</h3>
<p>— 孟公威</p>
<p>歷史是一面鏡子。「洪宣嬌」的上演，在觀衆言，他是提供了如洪宣嬌在第五慕中所說的：「這是可怕的回憶，不，這是血的敎訓！」在中旅本身言，也是如此。洪秀全（唐槐秋飾）在他臨死前說：「這樣的滅亡也好！也可以讓百年後我們的子孫知道，在大敵當前的時候，自己的內部要是小互相團結，互相諒解，顧到共同的利益，在共同的願望底下，盡其赤誠的向前進，前途—實在可怕得很！」台上台下情緒的激動，不是沒有理由的。</p>
<p>魏如晦用他史家的春秋之筆，在「洪官嬌」中指出了太平天國所以滅亡的原因，（見「公演前記」）而對於楊秀淸輩「掌兵權，專征伐」者排除異已，坐視不救，甚至不惜陷友軍於死地，使淸兵遂其以　制漢之心願者，更寄其無限的悲憤。他使我們如吞了一塊熾熱的鐵，我們的心在燃燒，我們的眼淚流着，代替了燙得說不出口的話。</p>
<p>導演者費穆導演話劇在上海還是第一决。他是電影界著名的導演，因此他的導演手法和一般的舞台劇導演是有不同所在的，他特別注意到每塲戲的氣氛，允其是第四第五幕，空氣的轉變如我們在他的影片中所見到那樣，操縱如意，戰爭塲面的有條不紊和熱烈緊張，在過去的舞台上更是不曾見過。如果說「洪宣嬌」最大的好處是編劇者的熱情如潮，那麼加强其中題，但又不使其成　無韁之馬，應該是導演者的功績。電影手法之應用到舞台上，替以後話劇壇開闢了一條新路，更是「洪宜嬌」最大的收獲之一。</p>
<p>在演員方面：唐若靑在第五慕中差不多一個人支持了一幕，是她的「殺手銏」。唐槐秋是舞台老將了，但他在此决重返上海以後，却不曾演過一個好戲，在「洪宜嬌」的第四幕中，那才重吐他的光芒，使人相信他的雄風還在。邵華的楊秀淸在第一二幕中是演得挺好的，第三幕則不够風流瀟洒葛鑫的石達開還欠沉着堅定。廖凡的章昌輝則有的地方失之於過份粗暴。</p>
<p>這一决燈光可以說很不壞，得力於蘭心舞台構造良多。效吳在第四五幕很好，前三幕則較差，唱滿江紅歌時，如果有更多人合唱，一定更好，如現在祇有一二個人唱，是不够的。</p>

<p>第六章　暫醉佳人錦瑟旁</p>
<p>李信以爲有隙可乘，胸中盤算純熟。便在這天夜裏，故意和紅娘子調笑逗歡，格外親密，要和紅娘子月下歡飲。紅娘子當然同意，便敎廚下端整幾樣可口的菜餚，開了一罎陳酒，即在庭中和李信對坐着飲酒閒談。這時正是十二三裏，明月快耍圓滿，月色甚好，照得庭中十分光明。李信和紅娘子各喝了二三杯酒，便取出一枝洞簫，嗚嗚地吹着，如怨如慕，非常悅耳。一闋奏罷，又斟着酒勸紅娘子暢飲數杯。紅娘子平日酒量本很淺的，今夜囚爲心中十分快活，多喝了幾杯，兩頰紅得如玫瑰一般，大有醉意，對李信嬌聲說道：「我已喝得够了，不能再飲，不如早些安睡吧。」李信帶笑說道：「我們再喝了三杯，方才可以回房，否則有負那皎潔的月兒了。」紅娘子被李信苦苦逼着喝酒，又喝了三杯，竟醉得言語含糊，不能自支了。李信遂敎人把殘餚撤去，自己把紅娘子徑輕抱起，假意說道：「你怎麼醉得這個樣子呢？我抱你去睡吧。」紅娘子也不回答，伊的嬌軀伏在李信身上，任憑李信怎樣擺佈。李信把伊抱入房中，放倒床上，紅娘子鼾聲已起。李信見伊已是睡熟，這正是難得的機會，本可以把伊一刀殺死，以絕後息，但因自己和伊也有一個月的恩愛，况且伊待自己眞心相愛，並沒有待錯的地方，若是把伊乘醉害死，未免太殘忍無情了。自己只要脫身下山就是哩。他想了一想，便拉過一條薄被，蓋在伊的身上，自己向抽屜中取了一些銀子，藏在身邊，走出房來，輕輕掩上房門。又到外邊去竊得一柄寳劍，佩在腰邊，以作防身之用。且喜無人知覺，悄悄地走到寨後，從廐中偷得一匹坐騎，跨上馬背，連加數鞭，疾馳下山而去。月光照着山徑，很自淸楚。他下得靑石山，以手加額，嗜自慶幸。（三九）</p>

<h3>Hull Issues Formal Statement: U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged; Aid to China to be Handled by Hopkins; Central Executive Committee Discusses Consequences of Soviet-Japanese Treaty</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull, abandoning his usual practice, issued a formal statement yesterday while receiving journalists, stating that the significance of the reported Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty had been overestimated. In reality, the treaty seemed to describe a situation that already existed between the two countries, so there was nothing surprising about it. However, whether both governments would abide by the treaty was still a question. As for the policy of the U.S. government, it would, of course, remain unchanged. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington – Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., stated yesterday that the Soviet Union's signing of a neutrality agreement with Japan was something that would "cause disappointment" in China. After meeting with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Dr. Hu told reporters, "Before we have the full text of the Soviet-Japanese agreement, we cannot predict how important the agreement is. However, the agreement is indeed regrettable. We hope that the Soviet Union will not cease its aid to China." Dr. Hu also stated, "The Soviet Union has provided aid to China in the past, and China expects this aid to continue." While Mr. T.V. Soong met with officials from the Treasury Department, Ambassador Hu spoke with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Mr. Soong said that he believed the situation regarding the imminent establishment of a consolidated fund agreement between the U.S. and China was "extremely smooth." (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared yesterday that U.S. aid to China would, at a minimum, maintain its current level. Mr. Hopkins would handle this matter. Mr. Hopkins is the former Secretary of Commerce, and several experts from the Treasury Department would assist him in matters of aid to China. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Executive Committee discussed the situation created by the Soviet-Japanese treaty yesterday morning for quite some time. Ministers of the relevant departments also gathered in the afternoon to study this issue. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction; Xinhua Daily Defends</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Official newspapers of the Kuomintang and the Central Army have expressed the central government's extreme dissatisfaction with the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty signed in Moscow on Sunday. However, the communist newspaper Xinhua Daily stated that these comments were unjust and unreasonable faultfinding. The Kuomintang's Central Daily News, the main mouthpiece of the Chongqing government, said that the treaty was extremely regrettable and that the treaty and its accompanying joint declaration violated the 1937 Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. The Central Daily News's commentary was titled "Infringement of Chinese Sovereignty," stating, "The Soviet authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination not to recognize Manchukuo, but no sooner were the words out of their mouths than they forgot their promise." The newspaper warned the Soviet government that agreements made with Japan were unreliable. The Central Army's Saodang Bao also similarly criticized the Soviet-Japanese treaty. The newspaper's commentary stated, "We are very pessimistic about the prospects for international justice and believe that the actions taken by our ally (the Soviet Union) are extremely regrettable." The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, strongly opposed the criticism of the Soviet-Japanese pact, stating that even the joint declaration issued simultaneously in Moscow did not affect the territorial integrity of Outer Mongolia and Manchuria. The Soviet Union's promise not to invade Manchukuo should be interpreted as the Soviet Union declaring that it would not use force to invade Manchuria and should not be interpreted as the Soviet Union recognizing Manchukuo as an independent country, nor does it affect our efforts to recover Manchuria. As for the claim that the new treaty conflicts with the 1937 Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, this is simply illogical because the nature of the two treaties is completely different. We cannot tolerate anti-Soviet propaganda or malicious criticism of this matter from an anti-Soviet stance. The Catholic Yishi Bao strongly attacked the Soviet-Japanese treaty, saying that it violated the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, which stipulated that the Soviet Union had an obligation not to conclude treaties with China's enemies. The Soviet-Japanese treaty also violated the 1924 agreement, which fully recognized Outer Mongolia as part of Chinese territory by the Soviet Union. Yishi Bao's commentary stated, "Now the Soviet Union openly equates Outer Mongolia with Manchukuo. This move has greatly damaged the Soviet Union's prestige. The Soviet Union has been deceived by Matsuoka." Yishi Bao said that Japan clearly wanted to remain neutral in the event of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, without being constrained by the Tripartite Pact. The newspaper further predicted that after the Soviet-Japanese treaty, the Soviet Union would engage in anti-German activities in the Balkans. The newspaper also said that the new Soviet-Japanese treaty would increase U.S. aid to Britain, China, Greece, and Yugoslavia. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News reported that a reporter visited the Soviet Embassy yesterday afternoon to interview Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin. The reporter was received by Guo Waerfu, the Second Secretary of the embassy, who stated that Ambassador Pan was suffering from a stomach ailment and was unable to receive guests, for which he was very sorry. Later, although the reporter submitted several written questions about the international situation, Ambassador Pan was unable to answer due to illness. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Newspapers' Opinions on the Neutrality Treaty are Divided and Inconsistent</h3>
<p>Washington – The reactions and speculations of major U.S. newspapers regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty are quite inconsistent. However, the general tone is that the treaty has an impact on the global situation, especially on the United States. The newspapers expressed unanimous opinions on the following three points: (1) Japan has been freed to operate in the Pacific, and the United States' attention must shift from aiding Europe to the Pacific. (2) The Soviet Union is now secure in Asia and can act freely in the West because the Soviet Union's interests in the West are threatened by Nazi forces. (3) The signatory countries still harbor suspicions toward each other, and the Soviet-Japanese treaty will only be effective as long as it benefits both parties. Whether the two countries can achieve the various benefits they are currently proclaiming through the Soviet-Japanese treaty depends on the circumstances at the time the treaty was concluded and how Japan will utilize the treaty in the future. It is questionable whether the Soviet Union and Japan will actively cooperate with the Axis powers. However, after the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty, Japan has given the Soviet Union the freedom to implement anti-German policies, while the Soviet Union has given Japan greater freedom to pursue anti-American and anti-British policies. If the Soviet authorities believe that slightly encouraging Japan can accelerate Japan's collapse and force the United States to withdraw entirely from the Pacific to the Atlantic, so that the Far East can belong to the Soviet Union, then from the Soviet Union's perspective, slightly encouraging Japan is inevitable. The New York Times stated that the Soviet-Japanese treaty would prevent Britain from stationing a large army in Singapore. According to the newspaper's explanation, this was a victory for Hitler's diplomacy, but the result may be the opposite. The New York Afternoon Newspaper believes that the new treaty is a prelude to the Soviet Union's activities in the Balkans. Therefore, this is actually a diplomatic failure for Hitler. Hitler hoped that after the end of the war in the South, he could attack the Near East from the Balkans. The new treaty is a warning from the Soviet Union to Germany, indicating that the Soviet Union intends to change its past policies. The 500,000 Red Army soldiers on the Siberian border have not yet reached the time for redeployment. Japan does not seem likely to transfer its troops stationed in Manchuria to other locations immediately. In addition, Japan faces the threat of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, and there is no hope of ending the war against China. This is also a major problem for Japan. The Washington Star believes that the new treaty is very unfavorable to the United States. The importance of the new treaty depends on how the signatory countries interpret it and how much trust they place in each other. On the surface, the new treaty seems to be a victory for Matsuoka's diplomacy, but the Soviet Union is clearly uneasy about Germany's victory in the Balkans and is willing to compromise with Japan in the hope that Japan will not attack the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union is drawn into war elsewhere. Sims, the international news editor of the Dutch-American newspaper, believes that the new treaty is a major threat to the United States, and a major war in the Pacific is likely to break out. The Washington Daily News stated that if the signatory countries believe that they can adhere to the letter and spirit of the treaty within five years, regardless of the situation, then the new treaty is indeed a very important treaty. However, both parties seem to intend to implement the new treaty only during periods when it benefits them. The Baltimore Sun said that if Japan interprets the new treaty as aiming to prevent the United States from entering the war, believing that this will prevent the United States' policy from exceeding the influence of last year's Tripartite Pact on U.S. policy, the United States should pay closer attention to the situation in the Pacific. However, this does not mean that the United States will stop aiding Britain or take other measures necessary to deal with the situation in order to safeguard its interests and security. (14th)</p>
<h3>Various Soviet-Japanese Issues Still Difficult to Resolve - Izvestia's Commentary</h3>
<p>Moscow – Today's Izvestia stated that the Soviet-Japanese agreement has not resolved all aspects of Soviet-Japanese relations, but it has opened a direct path toward resolution. The difficulties encountered in negotiations on the fisheries treaty, trade agreement, and economic issues between the two countries have long been known. The occurrence of this situation is clearly due to the lack of normal relations. Now that relations between the two countries have entered a new stage, it is expected that there will be positive results. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to France Assures that Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Vichy – Reliable sources told United Press today that the Chinese government is currently formally inquiring with the Soviet government about the Soviet Union's intentions toward China after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. It is reported that the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, assured Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador here, that the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Chongqing government had not changed and that the Soviet Union would continue to supply China with military goods. However, well-informed sources do not know whether the Soviet ambassador was instructed by Moscow or was merely expressing his personal opinion. French observers, on the other hand, asserted that the new treaty was beneficial to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, and was a failure of British and American diplomacy, especially that of the United States. They declared that the U.S. government could no longer hope to conclude any agreement with the Soviet Union to enable the U.S. and the Soviet Union to adopt parallel policies in China, Southeast Asia, or the Pacific. The French also said that the mutual distrust among Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union had been largely eliminated by the new treaty. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow – TASS announced here yesterday that Soviet border guards had eliminated a team of armed border crossers on the Asian border. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Pravda Says Japan Has Recognized the Importance of Friendship with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement, Pravda commented, "Thirty-six years have passed since the end of the Russo-Japanese War. At that time, the Russian side lost repeatedly and signed the Treaty of Portsmouth. However, it was not Russia or the Russian people who were defeated, but the Tsarist regime, which was not supported by the people. Since then, relations between Japan and Russia, and between Japan and the Soviet Union, have been very tense, and have even led to serious armed conflicts, such as Japan's intervention in the Far East from 1918 to 1922, attempts by some Japanese politicians to force the Soviet Union to accept their will, the Lake Khasan Incident, and the Red Army's annihilation of the invaders in the Battle of Nomonhan, all of which show that Soviet-Japanese relations are far from normal. Some Japanese politicians have attempted to make the Soviet Union the target of their aggressive policies, which is a grave mistake. This is because the Soviet Union has always been committed to peace and will never allow others to control its policies in violation of its own interests. The Neutrality Agreement and Declaration announced today are documents of far-reaching political importance. This document is an important step for the two countries to improve relations. In this regard, the wishes of the Soviet and Japanese governments are to strengthen the peace and friendly relations between the two countries. The Neutrality Agreement stipulates that both parties guarantee to maintain friendly relations and mutually respect each other's territorial integrity and inviolability. The agreement also specifies that if either signatory country becomes the target of an attack by another or multiple other strong countries, the other party shall observe neutrality throughout the entire period of the war. The Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration is also extremely important. The declaration follows the spirit of the Neutrality Agreement and states that both sides guarantee to respect the territorial integrity and inviolability of the Mongolian People's Republic and Manchukuo. This has put an end to all border conflicts. These border conflicts have not only disrupted the peace on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, but have also caused continued friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. The conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement is particularly important at a time when the First World Imperialist War is expanding. During this period, the improvement and normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations is indeed an important step for peace and is also fully in line with the Soviet Union's policy of peace and good neighborliness. The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement has provided a way to resolve pending issues such as the fisheries problem. Although Soviet-Japanese pending issues are of great importance, they have been delayed. The crux of the matter is the failure to establish a political understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan, and this political understanding is a prerequisite for resolving economic issues. This prerequisite has now been met, and the two governments have vowed to strive for friendly relations. At this point, all obstacles that previously hindered the development of Soviet-Japanese relations have been completely eliminated. In the past, the Japanese government sometimes failed to understand the importance of friendship with the Soviet Union, but now the Japanese government, including Konoe and Matsuoka, has realized that friendly Soviet-Japanese relations are the most important condition for the prosperity and development of the two countries. Since signing the Neutrality Agreement, the Soviet Union and Japan have assumed a firm obligation, and this obligation will certainly be fulfilled, because the development trends of the two countries have made it necessary for them to become good neighbors, eliminate all factors of hostility, and avoid actions that hinder each other from completing their historical missions. We warmly welcome the Neutrality Agreement and Declaration and firmly believe that this agreement will create a true Soviet-Japanese friendship and peaceful relations." (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Generally Believe that the Treaty Was Concluded Because the Soviet Union Was Facing Events in Europe</h3>
<p>London – Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, the Manchester Guardian reported that the Soviet Union signed the treaty with Japan because it feared Germany. If Japan remained neutral in the event of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, it would be extremely beneficial to the Soviet Union, but it would be detrimental to Germany. If war were to break out between Germany and the Soviet Union, how Germany and Japan would interpret Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact would still be a question. The reason why the Soviet Union is particularly keen on Japan remaining neutral is</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Turbulent International Situation</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been two relatively unusual events in the international arena: first, Germany and Italy have not hesitated to increase friction with the Soviet Union and have used force to invade the Balkans; second, despite various fundamental conflicts of interest between the Soviet Union and Japan, they have signed a political compromise treaty. These two events will, of course, affect the current and future international situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the most noteworthy international reactions after Germany and Italy's invasion of the Balkans, the first is the attitude of the invaded countries themselves, the second is Britain's expression, and the third is the Soviet Union's position. The terrible sacrifices and trampling suffered by Greece and Yugoslavia, who resolutely confronted violence, have shattered Germany and Italy's expected easy victory, creating a situation in which they are fighting on two fronts. On the British side, according to Prime Minister Churchill's speech a few days ago, there is indeed a determination to fight to the end alongside Greece and Yugoslavia, regardless of success or failure. This, in contrast to the recent war situation in Europe and Africa, shows that Britain is now gradually focusing on the European front. As for the reaction of the Soviet Union and Turkey, apart from the Soviet Union breaking its usual silence and condemning Hungary, Turkey has also begun to evacuate civilians in border areas. Of course, the Soviet Union and Turkey have not clearly expressed their opposition to Germany and Italy's actions, but their attitude is very different from the past. Putting these phenomena together shows that everything in the Balkans is brewing actively, and the current military advances and retreats of the two forces are secondary.</p>
<p>Regarding the international reactions after the Soviet Union and Japan signed the so-called "Neutrality Treaty," the most noteworthy is the second step taken by the two signatories, followed by the reactions of China, Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy, which have close interests with the Soviet Union and Japan. Analyzing the purposes of the two signatories, they are not focused on the treaty itself, but on the effect it has on the attitudes of other countries; as for the fundamental relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan themselves, it will not change because of this treaty. The reason for this move, on the Soviet side, is a strong warning to Germany and Italy's concentrated eastward advance into the Balkans; on the Japanese side, it is to try to intimidate Britain and the United States again, in an attempt to get them to ease economic blockades and political pressure. However, this is an ineffective wishful thinking. China has already clearly stated that it does not recognize it. Britain and the United States seem to consider it insignificant; in other words, this mere piece of paper will definitely not cause Britain and the United States to change their current firm stance. As for Germany and Italy, they have not yet expressed anything positive, but it is not difficult to see their unease and displeasure. This is because this treaty was definitely not facilitated by Germany and Italy, and it is not parallel to the Tripartite Pact and Soviet-German good relations.</p>
<p>Combining all these reactions, it can be seen that in the entire development of the international situation, there is now considerable turbulence again; and its future trend, based only on what has happened in the past few days, cannot be taken as a sufficient basis for evaluation, and we must wait for the evolution of many other key factors in the international arena. What can be pointed out now is probably no more than three things.</p>
<p>The first is Soviet-German relations. Assuming that because of Germany's aggressive eastward advance, a major friction and direct conflict arises between the Soviet Union and Germany, the international anti-aggression group that has been brewing for years can be promoted. In the situation where the Soviet Union joins hands with all just forces, not only can the flames of war in Europe be quickly extinguished, but also the forces of justice in any other region of the world can quickly achieve final victory. Conversely, if the Soviet Union continues to supply Germany, preventing it from attacking Ukraine for the time being, then Germany and Italy may be able to find a way to avoid direct conflict with the Soviet Union, but in the end, it will infinitely prolong the European war and bring major crises and future disasters to the Soviet Union itself. If the Soviet Union takes a middle course and completely cuts off aid and supplies to Germany and Italy, the war will also be shortened.</p>
<p>The second is US-Japan relations. If the United States believes that the Soviet Union's intention is to promote conflict between the United States and Japan, and that Japan does have the strength and courage to advance southward, then the actions of the United States and Japan in the East will inevitably accelerate and intensify. Conversely, if the United States considers it insignificant and Japan is still waiting and seeing, then the storms in the Pacific will eventually subside.</p>
<p>The third is Sino-Soviet relations. If the Soviet Union continues its past policy of aiding China, then all the current turbulence will only be superficial bubbles and will not affect its mainstream; conversely, the stabilization of the international situation will take more time. It is hoped that Japan can create a new war with the United States in the Pacific, and Germany is also very willing to see Britain's allies drawn into a new whirlpool of war. The Daily Express stated that the Soviet-Japanese treaty is merely (window dressing) for Japan, indicating that the Soviet Union no longer trusts Germany. If Germany actually moves east, then Japan will no longer be of assistance, and the Soviet Union's policy has no other purpose than to benefit itself. The News Chronicle also said that the Soviet Union is striving to build up its national strength while the powers are competing, and the only winner when the warring countries are both defeated will be the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union did not feel threatened by Germany before, but recently Germany's sudden advance into the Balkans has drastically changed the situation. To cope with the European situation, the Soviet Union urgently wants to guarantee the security of Siberia. Now the Soviet Union is giving Japan the opportunity to advance into the South Pacific, which is the price it pays to guarantee Siberia. The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent said that after the Soviet-Japanese treaty was concluded, Japan could be free from worries to the north and could now challenge Britain and the United States by advancing southward.

<p>Melbourne – Today, Japanese Minister to Australia, Kawai Tatsuo, stated that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Agreement did not contain any meaning of southward threat. Japan's policy toward Australia is an absolute and unchanging policy of peace and friendship. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, when receiving news reporters, was asked about the future relationship between the Soviet Union and the Chongqing government regarding the Soviet-Japanese Agreement. Ishii replied, "I hope that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Japan will be good from now on." Someone also asked whether the Soviet Union's aid to Chongqing with war supplies violated neutrality. Ishii replied, "That question needs to be discussed in the future. That question is not directly related to the Neutrality Agreement. It is hoped that the Soviet Union's attitude toward Japan will improve after the new treaty is established." The main point of the new treaty is that it contains the meaning of the Soviet Union's recognition of Manchukuo. However, the biggest point is that both parties must abide by neutrality. The treaty once used the word "inviolable" in place of "mutually non-aggression." The government will approve the treaty as soon as possible, approximately before Foreign Minister Matsuoka returns to Tokyo. The full text will be announced after approval. However, the outline announced on Sunday night is essentially nothing more than this. The treaty text is written in both Japanese and Russian, and both texts are authoritative. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters that the Soviet Union and Japan will sign a trade agreement within days.

<h3>German Army Adopts Pincer Offensive; Near East Faces Serious Threat; British Forces in North Africa Ordered to Retreat to Matruh; Fierce Battle Underway at Sollum and Tobruk</h3>
<p>Vichy: The Istanbul radio station reported that the German High Command plans to use the eastern Mediterranean as a base to capture Palestine, Suez, Egypt, and other places in the Near East, and to launch a pincer offensive with the German forces in southern Libya to encircle the British forces on the Nile River, and then to aid the besieged Italian forces in Abyssinia. Hitler may choose either the Soviet Union or Turkey to allow troops to pass through. German secret agents have already contacted Persia, Iraq, Syria, and other countries to negotiate passage. It is likely that it will be very difficult for German troops to pass through Turkey. According to reliable information, German expeditionary forces are arriving in Libya in large numbers. These troops have undergone long-term special training to withstand the extreme heat in the desert. They are required to live in artificially created hot rooms in Germany, with a temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit, covered with dry sand. They practice in these "hot ovens" for several months. Only those who are unharmed are sent to Africa. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: It is estimated that the Axis forces in Libya have two to four German mechanized divisions and four Italian divisions. The danger now facing the Suez Canal is far more serious than it was before the British launched their offensive on December 9 last year. German tanks are larger and stronger than British tanks. Now that the German army has captured air bases on the Libyan border, it is foreseeable that German aircraft will heavily bomb British military installations in Egypt and ships in the Suez Canal. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: German motorized units yesterday launched a strong challenge to British dominance in the Mediterranean, the likes of which the British Empire has never seen. The vast war in Egypt and the war in Greece appear to be about to begin. According to a communiqué, the Allied forces in Tobruk have repelled the joint German-Italian attacks, and the fierce battle in Sollum seems to be still ongoing. It is not yet known whether General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, intends to establish a defensive line near Sollum to defend Alexandria and the Suez Canal. People here do not regard the retreat of the British-Greek Allied forces from northern Greece as a defeat, as they do not know the details of any major battles. It is generally believed that the British-Greek Allied forces must be consolidating their positions and preparing to launch a large-scale operation. Furthermore, wireless reports from Athens state that the military situation in Greece is quite satisfactory and that the morale of the troops is even higher than when the German army began its attack. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>New York: According to the Ankara correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System last night, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, has ordered all troops in the Western Desert to withdraw to the defensive line in Matruh, which is located east of Sidi Barrani and is a strong stronghold on the Egyptian coast, fifteen miles west of Alexandria. British personnel in Ankara have received this news. It is said that the British army does not intend to defend Sidi Barrani. It is reported that the German army in Libya now has a total of three mechanized divisions, while the Germans say that there are four British motorized divisions in Tobruk. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: A communiqué from the War Office announced that on Monday morning, enemy infantry, assisted by tanks, attacked Tobruk.

The British forces have re-established contact with each other and inflicted heavy losses on the vanguard of the enemy forces near Sollum. In Abyssinia, British forces are continuing to pursue the disorganized and retreating enemy forces and have captured many prisoners, including a division commander and a brigade commander.

<h3>Nazi Mechanized Units Advance Towards Florina; British-Greek Allied Forces Hold Strong New Defensive Line; Greek Army Conducts Strategic Withdrawal from Koritza</h3>
<p>London: A communiqué from the War Office announced that British forces in Greece retreated to new positions on Saturday night. As they retreated, enemy forces continued to exert pressure on the eastern sector of the British lines, but were heavily defeated by the British covering forces and suffered heavy casualties. There was significant activity on the right flank of the British lines, but no major engagements. German forces also continued to attack the central sector of the British lines, but failed due to intense British artillery fire. Snow is now falling in the area and the weather is extremely cold. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: According to recent news received here, although powerful German forces, including mechanized units, are advancing towards Krichani and Siatista, fifty miles south of the Monastir Gap and Crete, the overall situation in the Balkans remains very encouraging. It is believed that the German advance in the Florina area has been achieved because of the British withdrawal to new positions over the weekend. It is reported that the new British positions are all in naturally dangerous terrain, where mechanized units will be of no use. The three places where the Germans are currently advancing—Krichani, and Siatista—are located midway between Salonika and Albania, forming a triangular area. It is reported that Krichani is not within Albania. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>Athens: Athens Radio broadcast a communiqué from the Greek Ministry of the Army stating that the enemy appears to be concentrating troops and supplies in the Monastir region. British and Greek aircraft are heavily bombing and strafing German forces in the area. The failure of the German forces to break through the lines in the first few days and the continuous reinforcement of the Allied forces' resistance lines have strengthened the general belief that the Allied forces have established a strong line from the Adriatic Sea to the Aegean Sea. The positions held by the Allied forces are naturally strong strongholds, and the enemy's mechanized blitzkrieg tactics are ineffective against them. All sources say that the situation can be considered satisfactory, and there is nothing else of major importance to report. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: Authoritative sources here stated last night that the Italian Ninth Army has now recaptured Koritza and its surrounding areas in Albania. Koritza is located in southeastern Albania, not far from the Greek border. It was occupied by Greek forces after the outbreak of the Italian-Greek War. (Haitong Telegraph of the 14th)</p>
<p>London: According to an official announcement from Athens, the Greek army has also conducted a strategic withdrawal from the Koritza area south of Lake Ohrid. This is because after the German army occupied southern Nischiraf, the flanks and rear of the Greek forces there were exposed, so a withdrawal was necessary. The Greek communiqué stated that the Germans only discovered the Greek withdrawal twenty-four hours later and urgently dispatched motorcycle units to pursue and search, but it was too late. Dozens of these units have already been captured by the Greek army. In the area of western Macedonia, fierce battles have taken place between tank units in the Ptolemaios area. In Albania, enemy forces have launched attacks in various places, but have been repelled, and over two hundred enemy soldiers have been captured. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: Berlin claims that British forces have begun a general retreat from Greece, which British senior officials dismiss as "hardly worth discussing."

<h3>Serbian Army Displays Fighting Spirit, Situation in Southern Country Greatly Improves</h3>
<p>Athens: The Athens Radio broadcast a statement from the Ministry of Information stating that the main forces of the Serbian army in the southern country appear to have retreated entirely into the mountains, making it easier to defend and posing a permanent threat to the flanks of the invading army. The situation in the northern part of the southern country is unclear. The Serbian forces there appear to have retreated from the plains of Croatia, Slovenia, and Banat, moving south into the highlands of Bosnia and Herzegovina, approaching Seville to defend strong defenses. The situation in the southern part of the southern country has greatly improved in the past forty-eight hours. It has been confirmed that the Serbian forces have broken the German lines of communication and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy forces. The German communiqué stated that its mechanized and armored units could not be used in this highland area. At the same time, an official communiqué from the capital of Bulgaria stated that British and Serbian aircraft had again attacked targets in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia on Monday night.

(Havas Telegraph of the 15th)</p>
<p>London: According to Athens Radio news, although German troops have now broken through the southern end of Yugoslavia, the situation in the mountainous areas of the south has improved significantly. Because German troops cannot use mechanized units in this mountainous area, the Serbian army has seized the opportunity to launch continuous attacks, inflicting heavy losses and cutting off its lines of communication. It is now reported that the Serbian army has advanced towards Skopje, which was recently occupied by the Germans, and there are reports that the Serbian army has recaptured the city. (Reuters Telegraph of the 15th)</p>

<h3>Balkan War Approaching Turkish Border; Turkey Trains Civilians to Defend Against Paratroopers; US Consul Advises American Citizens in Turkey to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Istanbul: The Turkish government has today begun a large-scale recruitment of Istanbul university students to organize special corps to be trained to resist paratroopers. Turkey's recent emergency measures to deal with possible incidents have been prompted by the German invasion of Southern Greece and the occupation of Bulgaria. At the same time, it is reported that Germany will hold large-scale naval and air force exercises near the Soviet Black Sea coast off the coast of Romania and Bulgaria within a week. Twenty German submarines gathered in the Romanian naval port of Constanta will participate in the exercises. Since the US Consul in Istanbul issued a third notice to Americans in Turkey to leave as soon as possible, the imminent threat to Turkey's borders has become increasingly clear.

<h3>British and German Air Forces Unusually Active; Piraeus Again Subjected to Air Raids</h3>
<p>Cairo: The British Air Force Command recently issued a communiqué stating that our aircraft continued to bomb German troops in Italian Libya today to hinder their advance, and attacked enemy supply columns between Mues and Sollum.

<h3>American Flying Fortress Arrives in London for the First Time; Range Can Reach Over Two Thousand Miles; Powerful Weapon for Aerial Warfare</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent reports that a new American four-engine Flying Fortress has crossed the Atlantic, breaking all records, and has already arrived in Britain. These aircraft are Boeing B-17-C models. This is the first time the British Aircraft Production Department has obtained this new type of aircraft, and it will soon be incorporated into the fleet to join British aircraft and other American four-engine bombers in combat, continuing to strengthen the power of the British Air Force's bombing offensive. The new Flying Fortress is manufactured by the Boeing Company's Seattle factory and is equipped with significant improvements. The four engines are Wright Cyclone engines, each with 1,200 horsepower. The speed is 300 miles per hour at an altitude of 25,000 feet, so it can fly 2,450 miles, enabling it to fly from Britain to the Norwegian border in the Arctic, the eastern border of pre-war Poland, or the southeastern corner of Italy and return. Its bomb load is also very heavy. The aircraft is fifteen and a half feet high, sixty-eight feet long, with a wingspan of over one hundred feet, and can carry seven to nine crew members.

<h3>Southeast Asian Defense Strengthened, Japan's Southern Advance Difficult, Japanese Troops in South China Fear Chinese Counterattack, Shenzhen Bao'an Troop Increase to 10,000</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to opinions of American military observers here, since the defenses of the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaya have been strengthened, it has become increasingly difficult for Japanese troops to invade these areas. The defense authorities of the various colonies are able to cooperate, so the air force strength has also been increased. The number of first-line fighter planes in the aforementioned island nations has exceeded one thousand, while Japan's total air force strength is only about two thousand. It is rumored that Japan has obtained blueprints for German Messerschmitt and Stuka dive bombers, but due to a lack of materials and manpower, they are still unable to manufacture them themselves. Japan's southern advance requires the assistance of a large air force, but observers point out that Japan's current air force strength is insufficient for a southern advance, as the distance from Japan's bases is at least 2,500 miles. Although Japan has bases in Taiwan and Hainan Island, the facilities are limited and can only provide small-scale supplies and repairs. Because the southern advance is not likely to be launched temporarily, the Japanese troops in Hainan Island and Vietnam have been summoned to Guangzhou and Bao'an to strengthen their position in southern China. Chinese newspapers report that the Japanese troops in Shenzhen Bao'an have increased to 10,000, which has caused considerable concern among people here, as it is very close to Hong Kong. However, well-informed sources say that the Japanese troops are very afraid of a counterattack by a large Chinese army from northern Guangdong, so their troop increase is only for self-defense. The Japanese army is determined to defend Danshui to block the Guangzhou-Shaoguan highway. At the same time, the Japanese navy is strengthening the coastal blockade line from Shantou to Macau to prevent the entry of supplies into the mainland. Hong Kong's commerce reached an unprecedented peak three months ago, but it has now declined sharply due to the blockade. People in Hong Kong are excited to hear that the Chinese army will launch a large-scale counterattack to drive the Japanese troops out of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Danshui, as this would restore prosperity to Hong Kong. However, this has not yet materialized. Recently, it was rumored that General Xue Yue, the commander of the Chinese army in Hunan, will be sent to Shaoguan to lead the counterattack. Xue Yue has defeated the Japanese army on the Longhai Railway, in Jiangxi and Hunan, and has a good reputation. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>A View of the United States Navy</h3>
<p>Fleet Prepared for Battle: We are now steaming westward in the Pacific. After receiving news of an enemy attack, Chief of Staff Taft, holding a military conference on the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," first ordered the head of the reconnaissance department, Androzhi, to search for traces of enemy ships. The reconnaissance department is composed of heavy cruisers and patrol bombers. Their actual task is to find the enemy's tracks, and then, carrying intelligence, retreat to the formation within the defense line. Before long, traces of the enemy were found. The axis of the 20-mile-wide fleet's ring formation advanced directly toward the enemy's location. Destroyers rushed out of the outer perimeter at high speed, battleships steamed forward, until the entire fleet assumed an advancing posture. The commander-in-chief expected that the enemy might turn south during the engagement. Therefore, he sent a large number of destroyers and light cruisers, driving out from the left to prepare for the enemy's destroyers to attack, so they could be netted and annihilated. However, for the sake of complete security, he retained some destroyers and light cruisers in the center of the formation. The commander-in-chief stood on the bridge of his flagship. The captain of the flagship, like the captain of any warship, stood in the conning tower, behind 16-inch-thick steel plates, directing the battle.</p>
<p>At the instant of discovering the enemy, all the officers and soldiers on the ship were extremely nervous. Vigorous junior officers climbed up the gun turrets. Sailors tested electric bells, codes, and telephones, and moved gunpowder bags to the upper hoist room. Gunners moved shells weighing 1,400 to 2,000 pounds, preparing to fire. Sailors in the engine room were all guarding their posts. When the sailors moved, they were quiet and very agile, closing the watertight doors and hatches tightly, removing the light bulbs in the room, and piling or tying down all movable objects and parts on the ground. Items such as buckets, chairs, frames, tables, and silverware were piled on the floor. If it were a real battle, sofas, tables, and chairs would have to be thrown into the sea one by one. Because when a cannon is fired on a ship, its recoil is very large, and wooden fragments, etc., hitting a person's body are more harmful than iron fragments, so they must be cleared out one by one before the battle. At this time, the inside of the warship was completely dark except for the green and faintly shining signal lights. Only the combat staff room hidden inside was brightly lit, filled with various wheels, machines, detection sights, and those calculating the firing. On warships, those who usually serve as barbers and cooks are assigned special combat duties, or clear away all the debris damaged by the artillery fire. All parts of the ship are isolated from each other, and the deck has long been cleared. Under the dim green light, the ship's chaplain entered the rear infirmary, waiting for the arrival of the wounded.</p>
<p>Enemy Destroyers Attack: The enemy and the two major fleets of the United States assembled into a combat formation, almost forming parallel lines. The United States Navy tried to assemble its larger and slower battleships. At this extremely tense moment, the enemy naval commander-in-chief, relying on his faster warships, planned to deliver a surprise blow while the US Navy was assembling into formation. His trick was to use the attack method of destroyers.</p>
<p>At first, he sent out two teams of destroyers, a total of eight ships, driving in reverse, spewing out a cloud of inky black smoke. The remaining twenty-six ships of the destroyer fleet were covered behind this smokescreen. In the far right corner, the enemy's light cruisers supported the battle. In an instant, these many destroyers, in a complex and interwoven dense formation, rushed out of the smoke screen and pounced directly on the front line of the American fleet. The American destroyers immediately came out to meet them. At this time, the enemy's light cruisers bombarded the American destroyers. The giant American cruisers opened fire on the enemy's light cruisers. The light cruisers in the defense line of the US Navy greatly demonstrated their heroic combat skills. Their fierce artillery fire had destroyed most of the enemy's destroyer fleet, and broken and floating damaged hulls were visible everywhere on the ocean.</p>
<p>All Scattered Things Were Removed from the Room Before the Battle</p>
<p>In the midst of the melee, three ships of the enemy's destroyer fleet that had not been sunk took the opportunity to pass through the line of fire and steamed forward. They had already aimed their guns. Mines were also ready to be released. Three miles away from the American front line, they turned their rudders to face the American front line with their broadsides, and each destroyer released eight mines in a row. The giant American battleships turned their hulls to the side, not to escape the enemy, but to sail toward the enemy, so that the dangerous mines would slide past the side of the ship without damaging them. The enemy's attack plan was completely shattered, and the smoke screen of their destroyer fleet had also dissipated. At this time, the attack opportunity for the American destroyers and cruisers was ripe. At this point, the battle had entered the final stage of the main battle between the battleships. (The End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, Teacher Strike Unabated, Both Main and Branch Schools Temporarily Suspend Classes, School Releases Information on the Strike</h3>
<p>The teacher strike at the Shanghai Women's Supplementary School, caused by teachers demanding higher pay which the school refused to accept, resulted in the Hua Long Road main school being unable to hold classes due to the lack of teachers yesterday morning, and therefore students were unable to attend classes and the school was at a standstill. Yesterday morning, the Bai Ke Road branch school also posted a notice announcing a temporary suspension of classes for one week. The main school also posted a notice announcing a temporary suspension of classes.</p>
<p>Teacher Demands: The teachers of the school have made a total of six demands. The following is an excerpt: (1) The base salary per hour should be calculated at one-tenth of the tuition fee charged by the subject, and individual teachers should receive the same treatment, with subsidies remaining unchanged. (2) Salary increases should be calculated based on the number of registered students, without being limited to 100%. (3) Except for summer and winter vacations, salaries should not be deducted for other holidays. (4) Teachers should not be dismissed on any pretext during the semester. (5) Letters of appointment for the next semester should be issued one month before the semester examination. (6) This regulation will be implemented from April 1941. The above six articles must be answered in writing before noon on April 12.</p>
<p>School Statement: According to the person in charge of the school, the school was founded in the autumn of 1932 and has been operating diligently for nine years, resulting in today's achievements. The occurrence of this incident was due to some teachers presenting the following conditions last Friday: (1) Double the base salary, (2) Salary increase based on the number of registered students, (3) The original 30% subsidy remains unchanged, (4) Holiday salaries are paid as usual, (5) Teachers should not be dismissed midway, (6) Letters of appointment for teachers for the next semester should be issued one month before the end of the semester, and a reply must be given by noon the next day, otherwise it will be difficult to continue. It is found that the school's colleagues' salaries were increased by 20% last semester, and another 10% this semester. For full-time teachers who teach for four hours a day, such as Mr. Dai, a university graduate, the monthly salary is 156.6 yuan, and for Mr. Tang, a middle school graduate, the monthly salary is 111.9 yuan. As for those with lower monthly salaries, they are all part-time teachers who are paid by the hour, about 80 cents per hour. Moreover, most teachers have lunch at the school, and the school also provides transportation. Such treatment is not low compared to other cram schools. However, now that prices are rising and colleagues are having a difficult time, the principal is quite considerate and is planning to increase the subsidy again. As for holidays, salaries are not deducted. There has never been a case of dismissing teachers midway. This is a decision to hire new teachers, which is being prepared by advertising for new students to open new classes. There is no intention to dismiss the original teachers. The director of education has been mediating and has already approved a slight increase in the subsidy. The teachers also agreed to attend classes as usual. On Monday morning, most of the teachers attended the first two classes and then left. Unfortunately, some students broke into the principal's office to question them, resulting in such a dispute, which is a phenomenon that has not occurred in the school for nine years. It is very regrettable. Efforts are currently being made to mediate, hoping that the situation will not escalate and will be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Study Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Study National Language (6) Xue Wu Jing</h3>
<p>(5) Points to Note in Writing: Reading is the absorption of material; writing is the expression of thought. Generally, after much reading, what is accumulated within will naturally flow out in the form of articles from emotion and intellect. I will now discuss the points to note, dividing them as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Handwriting is a person's appearance. Although one cannot speak of minute calligraphy or elegant strokes, the most important things are, first, correctness, second, neatness, and third, speed. One must strongly avoid broken characters, simplified strokes, and sloppiness. Also, words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as 辨 (biàn, distinguish), 辯 (biàn, debate), and 辮 (biàn, braid), and words that look similar but have different meanings, such as 羸 (léi, weak), 嬴 (yíng, win), and 贏 (yíng, win), must all be clearly distinguished. Do not make mistakes when writing. If there are any errors, create a table of corrections and review it often. Then, when facing the world, you will be more than capable. (B) The Way of Composition: First, use words correctly; second, construct sentences; third, plan the composition. Grammar must not be incorrect, and sentences must be clear and coherent. Further, strive for harmonious rhythm and beautiful rhetoric, but the most important thing is still moving description, genuine emotion, and noble thought. As for the use of allusions, they should be shallow rather than deep, and popular rather than obscure. Practice writing styles from proficiency to ingenuity, from imitation to creation. Although beyond the rules, it is always within the framework. The subtlety of using them depends on the heart, and that is the extent of literary ability. Speaking of opportunities for publication, assigned writing is for beginners. If a person's thinking has gradually matured, then write notes or diaries, observe at any time and any place. As long as emotions stir within, they will naturally manifest externally. Other ways, such as gathering comrades to study literature and reporting findings within a set time, can increase interest, and the source of writing will naturally flow torrentially, like the Yangtze River, with a momentum of a thousand miles.</p>
<p>6. Tools</p>
<p>If one wishes to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. The sharp tools of the national language are Shuowen, Ciyuan, and dictionaries. Since Xu Shu Chong of the Han Dynasty compiled the Shuowen, he thoroughly explained the origins of character creation, the format of the six scripts, and the differences between form, sound, and meaning. It is truly a remarkable book of philology. Although many have written about Shuowen, the Shuowen annotations by Duan Yucai, the Shuowen punctuated readings by Wang Yun, and the Shuowen Tongxun Dingsheng by Zhu Junsheng are all immortal works. Those who wish to deeply enter the hall of national language must, of course, browse through them. Even at the lowest level, one must first read a primer on characters to understand the origins of characters, so as not to be confused and interpret them literally. As for the compilation of dictionaries, the Kangxi Dictionary is the most comprehensive in terms of content, and Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Code Dictionary is the fastest to check. Everyone should have one of each on their desks for easy reference. And for the investigation of sources, there is first Ciyuan, then Citong, and finally Cihai, which everyone knows, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>7. Cultivation</p>
<p>I have taught the national language for twenty years. Besides students of average talent, the best students are either highly talented, writing fluently, or diligent in study, turning base metal into gold. These two types of people often go their separate ways and cannot be combined. Now I put forward the word "cultivation" precisely to refine them into one. The starting point is to broadly read books of ancient and modern times, observe the dynamics of human groups, observe their commonalities, and grasp their essentials, so that emotions are rich, reason is profound, and personality is noble. Then, whether speaking at length or briefly, with the six reins in hand, one can control them freely, can reach the peak and become an outstanding person. Try to see if there is the righteous indignation of Yue Wu Mu, where would the Man Jiang Hong be? Without Wang Chong's talent and thought, where would the Lun Heng be? And Ziyu's magnificence is entrusted to Mencius, and Zhong Ni's greatness is expressed in the Analects. Those who truly aspire to deep learning in the national language cannot simply strike two lines of classical Chinese or write a set of humorous and satirical articles to be considered an outstanding literary figure for thousands of years. Nourish your temperament, elevate your personality, and articles that flow from your true nature are the great works of thousands of years. (End)</p>

<h3>Food Grain: Rice Prices Soar, Difficult to Stabilize; Over 100,000 More Bags of Rice Arrive; Hoarders Still Operate Recklessly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign rice saw initial gains followed by a drop, and then a recovery. Although the final result was a rise of one or two yuan compared to the midday market of the previous day, it was still down by half a yuan to one yuan compared to the evening market of the previous day. When the market opened in the morning, following the upward momentum of the previous day, buying interest was still active. The selling prices of various grades of foreign rice all rose to the high prices of the previous evening. No. 1 Saigon immediately opened at 122 yuan, No. 2 and Xiaojiao at 118.5 yuan, and other rices all rose, two or three yuan higher than the previous midday market. However, after the high prices, sales became sluggish, and various rumors of self-inflicted troubles were proven to be insignificant. The new hoarders, seeing a thick profit of seven or eight yuan per picul, were happy to take the opportunity to unload, and the market fell back by two yuan at noon. However, in the afternoon, the hoarders used rumors to stimulate the market again, and buying interest became strong again, with selling prices of various rices rising by another 1.5 yuan. Although the result showed a firming trend, the market was ultimately lower than the previous evening. Yinghua Company's returned rice opened at 137-138 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 112.5-111 yuan for broken rice, and 140-141.5 yuan for Xiaojiao. The transaction volume was about 1,500 tons. There are currently 15,000 bags of foreign rice.</p>
<p>The rampant momentum of the rice hoarders is not weakening. The surge after the Tomb Sweeping Festival is shocking.</p>
<p>However, it can be seen that a large amount of foreign rice is still arriving at the port. The Therese Maller, a liner of the 賜洋行席拉斯, transported a large batch of foreign rice from Rangoon, totaling over 5,000 tons, or about 55,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th and docking at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload. In addition, the Essi, managed by the manager of the Zhongtong Company, transported 16,029 bags of foreign rice from Haiphong, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload. The Taigoo Company's Taiyuan also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 5,265 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docking at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,651 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf, unloading overnight last night.</p>
<p>In addition, a large batch of Java pearl rice is coming to Shanghai. The Java Company's Zhibisha sailed directly from Surabaya to Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 34,000 bags of corn and docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 3,548 bags of corn from Hong Kong and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rices has become scarce, so the sellers are more determined to raise prices, continuing to push higher. The sales side also believes that the prices are already cheaper than foreign rice, and the shops are still willing to stock up, so the prices of both thick and thin japonica have been able to increase by two yuan. Changbang Qingpi Zhente Japonica is seeing 128 yuan per dan, Special Japonica 126 yuan, Kunshan dan seeing Special Japonica 125 yuan, the next grade 120 yuan, Qingjiao dan seeing thin rice 117 yuan. Glutinous rice saw foreign rice continue to rise in the early market and once tightened along with it, but then it also followed the decline, and the result was a settlement with one rise and one fall. The prices quoted were similar to before.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour's Rising Momentum Slightly Checked</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the rising momentum of foreign flour was slightly checked. Since Thailand controlled the export of rice and the Soviet Union and Japan signed a treaty, market prices rose quite rapidly, and the prices of various goods have all jumped out of the 30 yuan mark. However, some "kick the ball" trades, profit-taking retailers, have slightly closed out their positions, so the market lacks the momentum to rise. Huaniao Brand Australian flour has eased back to 30.05 yuan, and Jinlong Brand Kan flour has fallen from 30.03 yuan to 30 yuan, a slight retreat after a large rise. Factory flour is still 25 yuan, but the factory is said to be facing a shortage of raw materials and may stop supplying, and is currently trying to find a solution.</p>
<p>A large amount of flour is exported. There are 85,000 bags of flour on the Taikoo Company's Liangzhou, which will be shipped to Tianjin today. Another 22,000 bags are on the Hanyang, which will be exported this afternoon and shipped to Xiamen. All of the above flour is Australian goods. Yesterday, the Java Company's Zhibisha arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 1,000 bags of wheat from Java, which is currently being unloaded at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. (Zu)</p>
<p>Wheat: Still not breaking free from a firm and quiet situation. The supply of inland Dumai has been dry for a long time, and there are only occasional scattered arrivals, in very small quantities, which are mostly taken by Japanese factories. The price is still between 45 and 46 yuan. Market buying interest is still invisibly stagnant.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans and Corn, Actual Sales Can't Afford It</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for yellow soybeans and corn was weak due to sluggish actual sales. Corn fell by about one yuan. Transactions involved 1,300-1,400 bags of spot goods (market details in the market price column), and 250 tons of futures. Yellow soybeans settled about 1,000 bags. Soybean oil fell first and then stabilized, with 500 barrels of Dalian spot oil traded, priced from 154 yuan to 156 yuan. Over 1,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April, priced from 154.5 yuan, falling to 53.5 yuan, then rising to 56.25 yuan, and later settling at 55.75 yuan. Another 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded, priced at 103 yuan. Peanut oil was flat. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at 119 yuan. Over 500 cans of Jiangbei Benfang canned oil were priced at 160-161 yuan. Soybean cake also did not change much. The market was firm first and then stabilized, with actual sales slightly embellished, and speculation still accounting for the majority. A total of 13,000-14,000 pieces of both spot and futures cake were traded.</p>
<p>On the 16th, 670 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen, and 210 bags were exported to Hong Kong. Another 1,000 cans of raw oil and 240 pieces were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Difficult to Improve Temporarily</h3>
<p>After a four-day holiday, the over-the-counter market for public bonds opened as usual yesterday. Because there were slight changes in the environment, such as the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, although it did not concern the overall situation, it did affect China to some extent. Therefore, the public's sentiment was very soft, and the selling side took the opportunity to temporarily stop, causing a plunge of almost one yuan. In the afternoon, because the buying side had a large appetite again, it rose back several jiao. At present, the market is originally due to the matured futures of the leaders sold by Yuxing in the previous few days, which is considerable in amount. The general buying side is already satisfied, causing the selling side to gradually feel powerless. There is no officially good prospect in the short term. The opening was small yesterday morning, with Hengfu selling very actively. Xie Kang and Jiufeng were also very eager to sell. Retail investors also sold more and bought less. The buying side, Tong Kang and Yi Tai, was more lively. Runhe and Xie also and Dingkang buying was also not weak. Although Zhenkang Lianhe and Tong Shun He Feng sold, the market was still pushed up by several jiao. As a result, the market only decreased by three or four jiao to six jiao. The total transaction volume was about 2,109,000. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 24 yuan.</p>
<p>When the public industry stock market opened, prices plummeted, and then gradually strengthened, and the market situation turned active, and transactions were extremely prosperous. The market softened again after closing in the afternoon, although it was higher than the morning opening price.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Firms Take Advantage of Low Prices to Aggressively Settle Import Bills</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. Over-the-counter trading of British and American exchange was active after the holiday, but the state was still quiet, and the underlying trend showed a loosening first and then a tightening. This was because foreign firms had a large number of settlements, such as the foreign rice item, which had 500,000 to 600,000 US dollars (some say one million US dollars), and Japanese banks also bought in 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars. Therefore, although foreign telegraphs and local merchants were selling at first, it loosened to 3 pence 265625 and 5 yuan 34375 (bank selling price), but soon tightened to 3 pence 234375 and 5 yuan 28125. After entering, although there were telegraphs conveying news of British military defeats, and investment merchants sold again, Chinese banks still had a good appetite, resulting in a slight tightening in the end, contracting by zero one five six two five and zero three one two five compared to before the holiday. Speculators were mostly waiting quietly for the actions that Japan would take regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement.</p>
<p>Large Foreign Rice Settlements</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, because the London Grand Cable was nearly far and long, zero six two five, New York silver prices and London raw gold remained stable, and the exchange rate of British to American exchange did not move, while the exchange rate to Shanghai fell by zero three one two five, and American to British contracted by a small half, and to Shanghai by a point. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 3 pence 25 for British gold and 5 yuan 3125 for American exchange, both without any honors or disgraces compared to before the holiday. After opening, foreign telegrams were selling, and local speculators also followed suit slightly, and the market hardened. The transaction volume for US exchange in April and May reached 5 yuan 34375 and 375. At this time, the bank's spot price of 5 yuan 34375 and 3 pence 265625 were willing to supply. When HSBC's listed price was announced, it remained unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was also announced as flat. After this, the foreign firm suddenly bought aggressively at low prices, and also had foreign rice settlements, and Japanese banks also competed to absorb, and the market suddenly tightened. It traded US exchange in the current month at 5 yuan 34375 and 3125, and US exchange in May at 5 yuan 3125. At noon, speculators also turned from selling to buying, and the situation reversed. At the tightest, US exchange in May was absorbed at 5 yuan 28125. At the close, the British gold was announced at 3 pence 234375 and the US exchange was announced at 5 yuan 28125, with the British tightening by zero one five six two five and the US by zero three one two five compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>Speculation Turns to Stability</p>
<p>After the initial settlement, speculators immediately intended to sell due to unfavorable foreign news. US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 3125 was thought to be sold, while foreign firms supported 5 yuan 34375, so the market showed a slight loosening. After 3 o'clock, Chinese banks came to collect and absorb, and the state was flat. US exchange for the current month was purchased at 5 yuan 3125. The results for spot settlement were all announced at 3 pence 234375 for British gold and 5 yuan 28125 for US exchange, with British tightening by zero one five six two five and US by zero three one two five compared to before the holiday.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Fluctuates, Unstable, Falls First and Then Rises, Spot Goods Also High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, the cooked red over-the-counter market, the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday has ended, and the market opened as usual. The situation was quite unstable, the changes were very severe, falling and losing, waiting for a sudden rise, returning to outside the 6,500 yuan mark, and the hearts of all parties turned from fatigue to firmness.

<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Hong Kong Sales Active, Yarn Market Soars, Double Horse Near 1,500 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market after the holiday suddenly rose, because Hong Kong dollars' demand for double horse yarn continued to be prosperous, and Xin Shen factory's lease problem has been resolved, starting from April 15, only 3 yuan per bag will be added, so the multi-headed is stable, and it has nothing to do with the overall situation. In addition, the foreign exchange rate has shrunk slightly, and the spot gold has risen, all making the bulls active, so the buying is , the market soared, and the high price of 20 count double horse was 1,494 yuan, and the low price was 1,432 yuan. At the beginning of the afternoon, 1,494 yuan was traded, rising to 978 yuan, falling back to 1,4812 yuan, and then rising to 1,4912 yuan due to large households dragging in. At present, the yarn market, because the price of 42 count yarn is too high, and the distance from the double horse price is too far, so there are buyers entering.</p>
<p>Double horse morning opened with mediocre popularity, because of the news from the previous day that the Soviet Union and Japan had signed a neutrality treaty, the bulls closed out, and the first market price was 1,445 yuan. As soon as this market opened, sellers rushed, but the market order was chaotic, and the shouts in and out were inconsistent, and it fell to 1,432 yuan. Suddenly, the market situation changed, saying that the spot gold price was good, and the buying momentum suddenly increased, rising directly to 1,460 yuan. There were slight round trips at this price, and then it was heard that the Guangbang was purchasing very well, and 2,000 bags of the double horse brand were bought. The current yarn market price is frequently moving forward, and people's hearts are unanimously upward, so the market is opening higher and higher, reaching 1,494 yuan, but some profit-takers vomited it out, slightly returning to 1,498 yuan closing, checking the total transaction volume during the day totaled 11,000 bags, and 12 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 3 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount bought by each gang mouth is listed as left,</p>
<p>Hong Kong 3,000, peers 8,000</p>
<p>Total 11,000</p>
<h3>Recent Reasons for the Sharp Increase in Double Horse Yarn</h3>
<p>The 20 count double horse yarn, which has been around for a long time, has suddenly soared in the past few days. The reasons for the rise are listed on the left,</p>
<p>(1) Before the customs closure, most people's hearts turned to optimism, because the factory's problem of increasing warehouse rent was not clear, and the prudent ones closed out to avoid the risk of the four days, so it fell from 1,455 yuan to 1,431 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The newspaper reported the previous day that the Soviet Union and Japan had signed a neutrality treaty, and the market price was naturally looking bad. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange rate shrank again, the strips rose, and the 42 count line price was sold at 2,600 yuan, with a difference of 1,100 yuan from the double horse price. In addition, the sales of cloth recently have been smooth and the selling price has risen without falling. As for the raw materials, they are not loose, and speculators suddenly have a strong interest in the changing horses of Danbo, and buyers are coming one after another, so the market is soaring.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, most of the psychology was that the price of double horse yarn was too high, buying miscellaneous brands and dropping double horse. Therefore, there were more vacant horses in the field. Recently, the price of miscellaneous brands of yarn has been raised, and they cannot be cashed out. The double horse situation is tight, and the shorts are panicked and make up for it. Therefore, the bulls shouted wildly, it is not surprising to want to go to 1,5600 yuan, the fundamental problem is still thinking about the actual sales, whether the export volume from Nanyang is continuous.</p>
<h3>Flower Price Rises, Fine Velvet Rises Especially Sharply</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is rising with the yarn market. The raw materials for 42 count are rising by 17 yuan. Because the double strand line price has been sold at 2,600 yuan, the factory profits are rising strangely, so they are also willing to bid for raw materials. However, the spot goods on the market are thin, so people's hearts are particularly strong. As for the 20 count raw cotton, the rise is more moderate due to the relationship of Indian cotton. However, the future of 20 count yarn is optimistic, and the raw cotton that depends on it will naturally rise in response. According to this transaction excitement, the market price is rising step by step. Yesterday, the yarn factory and the flower number did a total of 2,345 pieces, and another 500 packages, and the price rose 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The current market price of traded spot cotton is listed as left,</p>
<p>Midland 4 0 Yong'an 4 0 pieces sent to the factory</p>

<p>Fire machine grass bag 206 Feng 200 Warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Fire machine drawing bag 207 Feng 300 Warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Another message, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, due to the enthusiastic competition of all parties, the market is active, because the international situation is gradually becoming urgent, and it is quite difficult to purchase overseas, so the yarn market has soared in recent days, and the guests are all striving to purchase in order to transfer and sell, so the cotton market has also entered a lively state, whether it is the same industry factory, have the intention to purchase in large quantities.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is active and firm, rising due to industry purchases and spot traders buying in, and the result is that the closing price is six to thirteen pounds higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to speculators buying in, and then fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales, but finally rose again due to speculators buying in, and yesterday's closing price, except for flat low three ratio, the rest rose two or three ratio. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be higher than two ratio weak.</p>

<h3>Dried Goods: Xinghua Longan</h3>
<p>Retailers Occasionally Selling Off</p>
<p>Xinghua Longan: Arrivals have been scarce recently, but retailers in the market are unwilling to hold onto their goods for long and are gradually selling off. For example, Xinghua goods priced at four yuan are occasionally being sold, a decrease of over ten yuan from the previous price. Other miscellaneous goods are naturally not expected to be optimistic. It is predicted that before the drying season, another small portion may need to be released, and prices may continue to ease.</p>
<h3>Changing from Monthly Salary Payments to Installment Payments</h3>
<p>— Zheng Shixian</p>
<p>The cost of living index in this city has risen to a ratio of 1 to 6.8 compared to before the war. For the general population who rely on salaries for a living, their income is somewhat higher than before the war, but the proportion of the increase absolutely cannot keep up with the drastic increase in the cost of living. Therefore, the difficult living conditions of the general salaried class today are truly unimaginable to those who are well-fed and clothed. Under these circumstances, besides the authorities of various factories, stores, and companies considering the original difficult lives of their employees and increasing employee salaries or allowances as much as possible, I think there is another method that can help the salaried class manage and allocate their finances, and it is worth adopting by various factories, stores, and companies, and that is to improve the salary payment system.</p>
<p>In China's industrial and commercial sectors, employee salaries have always been calculated on a monthly basis. The payment period is also mostly at the end or beginning of the month. In the past few years, when prices were low and expenses were manageable, the monthly expenses of an average salaried family were only about 20, 30 to 100 yuan. The amount was small, and management was easier. But today, (unfinished)</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest Rises, Affecting Public Order: Labor and Management Should Accept Mediation: Maochang Optical Company Smashed Yesterday: Labor Dispute in Water and Wood Industries Scheduled for Mediation Within Days</h3>
<p>Police Authorities Determined to Suppress Illegal Actions of Gathering Crowds and Causing Trouble</p>
<p>Rice prices rise without falling, and coal briquettes and all essential commodities have repeatedly increased in price. The lives of workers in this city are in imminent danger. In recent days, rice and coal briquette prices have increased even more, causing labor unrest that had been frequently resolved to become unstoppable again. Since the strike in the water and wood industries, due to the extremely large number of workers in that industry, social tranquility is greatly affected, and the situation is becoming serious. Labor-management disputes in other industries are still under negotiation and mediation by the authorities. To date, hundreds of thousands of people have gone on strike throughout the city. The management has repeatedly made concessions, hoping that the labor side will accept mediation within the lowest possible limits to maintain order. As for actions of gathering crowds, causing trouble, and forcing action, the police in the two concessions are determined to suppress them.</p>
<p>Maochang Optical Company Smashed</p>
<p>The store of Maochang Optical Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road was suddenly stormed by a crowd of workers from other eyeglass manufacturing companies at 3:10 PM yesterday, who smashed property and other items, causing a disturbance. Order was immediately restored, and business resumed as usual. The incident was caused by the fact that workers who make lenses in the eyeglass industry in this city have recently demanded wage increases from the management due to difficult living conditions, but were unsuccessful, and implemented a strike starting on the 6th of this month, which has not yet been resolved. However, some colleagues have harmonious labor-management relations and did not participate. Maochang Optical Company was one of them. As a result, sixty to seventy people came to the company at around 3:00 PM yesterday, without asking why, using stones and wooden sticks, smashing six large glass windows along Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, and a large number of goods in the display windows. At that time, the Laozha Police Station, being nearby, had received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to suppress the situation. The perpetrators scattered as birds and beasts when they saw the detectives arriving. As a result, more than twenty workers were arrested, and the cut telephone lines were taken to the police station for interrogation, pending referral to the court this morning. It is reported that Maochang Company suffered very heavy losses, no less than several thousand taels of silver.</p>
<p>Sasoon Group Hotel Industry Still Works Slowly: The Sasoon Group's Cathay Hotel, Grosvenor House, Metropole Hotel, and Hamilton House, etc., experienced further expansion of labor unrest yesterday. Waiters in the catering departments of these hotels have also joined the slowdown, forcing travelers to eat elsewhere. The management's attitude is also very firm, so it is difficult to obtain any hope of resolution at this time. According to their General Manager Ovardi yesterday, regarding the strike of employees in these hotels, what demands the workers have are currently unknown. This is because the workers have not yet formally submitted any demands. Yesterday, the elevator operators of the two hotels also joined the slowdown. As a result, the elevator operators of the two hotels were replaced by White Russians to maintain operations.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Slowdown</p>
<p>According to workers at the Cathay Hotel, Cathay Mansions, Metropole Apartments, and Hamilton House, the reason for the strike is, "We have all been working at the Cathay Company for a long time, most of us from the opening until now. Usually, we are very dedicated in our work, so labor and management have been able to get along until now. In these extraordinary times, the cost of living is increasing every day, but our wages are only 26 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of over 30 yuan, totaling only about 60 yuan. And in a month, there are only three weeks of work, and one week is off. During the off week, wages and rice subsidies are deducted. In today's high-priced era, how can these meager amounts maintain our lives? Therefore, in the past few months, we asked the management for a salary increase, but the management did not approve it. We decided to apply to the management based on the spirit of labor-management mutual benefit and allow four conditions:</p>
<p>Four Conditions</p>
<p>(1) Salaries below 35 yuan will be increased by 100%, and those above 35 yuan will be increased by 75% (calculated according to the March salary of this year). (2) Employees should not be dismissed or laid off for no reason, and laid-off employees should be reinstated. (3) Temporary living allowance of 20 yuan (including coal subsidy). (4) The rice subsidy will remain the same at one and a half dou. Representatives were elected to earnestly request the management to give a sincere reply: However, it was not accepted at all. We could not bear the oppression of the management and were forced to all leave our jobs and wait for the management to give us a fair answer. The above situation is what we have experienced."</p>
<p>Water and Wood Industry Labor Dispute Will Be Negotiated Immediately</p>
<p>The water and wood industry workers in this city number in the tens of thousands, originally divided into the two concessions and Zhabei, with slight differences in wages. Carpenters are paid one jiao less than plasterers. Since the cost of living in Shanghai has soared, rice subsidies have already been universally increased. The demands now being made have been approved by the management for an increase of 90%. However, some workers believe that the wages increased by the management are not enough to maintain their livelihood and forced a strike, causing the labor unrest to gradually expand. The association has already submitted reports to the Public Works Department and the Directorate of Public Works for investigation. Currently, all construction projects in the city are at a standstill. It is reported that labor and management will negotiate again today.</p>
<p>Moving Companies Resume Work Today</p>
<p>The 800 drivers and laborers of the Mao Tai and Shanghai moving companies, who went on strike on the 10th due to demands for wage increases not being met, have now learned that the labor representative Qian, Tang Genfa, etc., met with the management representative Wang Youtang on the afternoon of the 15th, after negotiations, a satisfactory solution has been reached. In addition to accepting eight conditions, the management also agreed to pay wages as usual during the strike period. Therefore, the labor side has scheduled to resume work today. It is reported that the four companies of Taiping, China, Wing On, and Shangtian have not yet accepted negotiations, so the labor unrest is still difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Resuming Work at Datong Tobacco Factory</p>
<p>The Datong Tobacco Factory at 837 Hart Road, in January of this year, because all the stoves were old and could not be used, a plan was made to replace them all with new ones. However, during the shutdown period, the factory paid a subsidy of six jiao per day. All the installation was completed on the first of this month, and work began on the 8th of this month. On the 13th of this month, dozens of male and female workers in the cutting department of the factory made nine wage increase requests to the factory. However, the factory stated that it had not yet started work, so it indicated that it had absolutely no room for consideration of the demands made by the labor side.</p>

<p>Japanese Residents Also Hope the Situation Will Improve</p>
<p>The English-language *North China Daily News* reported that a certain official of the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters this morning (the 15th) that the new organization proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been endorsed by the Japanese side. Therefore, there is hope for improvement in the overall situation of the International Settlement, and the area north of Suzhou Creek may return to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The enthusiasm of Japanese residents in this area to see Shanghai return to normalcy is no less than that of other foreign nationals. Therefore, there is considerable hope for an adjustment of the current situation in the near future.</p>
<p>Police Authority in the Northern District Has Not Yet Been Resolved</p>
<p>It is said that one of Miura's proposals is to establish a separate police district in the Hongkou District, with a Japanese police officer as the director and a British police officer as the deputy director, but still under the jurisdiction of the Police Department. At that time, the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. Later, the negotiations were suspended, and as a result, there has been no second discussion since August of last year. At the same time, it is learned that public utilities such as the Shanghai Tramways Company have requested permission from the Japanese authorities to take back the tram operation rights in the northern district of the Public Concession. Currently, 280 "Huazhong Public Motorcars" operate in the area north of Suzhou Creek, carrying passengers. These public cars have neither special licenses nor have they paid registration fees to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Moreover, the drivers of these public cars do not hold driver's licenses. In the event of an accident, they treat the law like a piece of discarded shoe. Furthermore, passengers on these public cars are often subjected to insults and scolding. In addition, there are pedicabs seeking donations and registration fees operating in the northern district of the Public Concession. Pedicabs and rickshaw pullers often have disputes and conflicts on the road, hindering traffic, and the Japanese authorities turn a blind eye to them.</p>
<h3>Sharply Raising Prices Endangers Public Order: Secret Investigation Completed: Legal Action to Be Taken After the Situation Calms Down: Another 110,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday and the Day Before</h3>
<p>In this city, due to the special environment, those who disregard the livelihood of ordinary people and social order recklessly manipulate the market, sharply raising prices, especially for rice and coal, which is very distressing. The prices of all kinds of goods have been repeatedly increased by these people, reaching new highs. According to inquiries from relevant parties, the authorities are deeply concerned about the livelihood of both Chinese and foreign residents in Shanghai. Although they have repeatedly issued orders to suppress prices and urged merchants to consider the overall situation and not raise prices without authorization, these people are difficult to change their nature and obey in appearance but disobey in reality. For the sake of deterrence, since the launch of the secret investigation, it has now been completely completed and formally entered the next phase. It is heard that as soon as the opportunity arises, they are determined to severely punish them in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Rumors in the Rice Market Subsided Yesterday and Remained Peaceful</p>
<p>The Rice Market Management Committee held a discussion meeting at the Rice Merchants Association yesterday afternoon, and made detailed discussions on several points such as unblocking sources, stabilizing market operations, and suppressing rice prices, but no decisions were made. It is learned that rice industry groups in this city are currently waiting for the authorities of the two concessions to promulgate various measures to suppress speculation and stabilize the rice market so that they can comply. It is learned that the amount of goods currently stored in Chinese and foreign rice warehouses in this city is the most abundant in two years. Moreover, due to the high rice prices, the general public is buying ground wheat and other miscellaneous grains as substitutes. Therefore, the daily flow of rice has clearly become less substantial than before. Judging from the current situation, the amount of rice in storage will definitely not decrease. If there is no sabotage, the food panic will not be difficult to resolve. Therefore, the authorities' thorough investigation of rice reserves and punishment of rice parasites cannot be delayed any longer. After the rice market opened yesterday, because rumors were proven to be baseless, people's minds tended to stabilize, and the prices of domestic and foreign rice rose and fell alternately.</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in Two Days</p>
<p>Rice prices in this city continue to rise, and the livelihood of ordinary people is worrying. Recently, the authorities have taken action to deal with general groups, such as thoroughly investigating stockpiles, setting deadlines for sales, and severely punishing those who violate the rules. After hearing this, the public was very satisfied with the authorities' handling of the situation and expressed their gratitude, believing that there was hope for rice prices to fall. Unexpectedly, after the announcement in the newspapers, not only did the prices fail to fall, but they even increased, causing great disappointment. It is found that the source of foreign rice is arriving in large quantities. In the past two days, a total of more than 113,000 bags of foreign rice arrived at the port. Therefore, the reasons for the continued high rice prices cannot be guessed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Training Paratroopers in Northeast Jiangwan: Many Believe This is a Sign of Japanese Expansion: One Japanese Regiment Recently Passed Through Shanghai and Was Transferred Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM yesterday (the 14th), thirty new-style large Japanese transport planes participated in a paratrooper exercise over this city. This is a sign of Japanese expansion, but it is not yet known in which direction. During the exercise, many Japanese army soldiers descended by parachute over the skies north of the city center and towards Pudong. The Japanese airfield in northeast Jiangwan was closed to onlookers. However, the fact that Japanese paratroopers jumped from transport planes escorted by fighter planes showed that there was some activity in the area.</p>
<p>How They Are Equipped Cannot Be Ascertained</p>
<p>The Japanese planes flew to an altitude of about 10,000 feet before the paratroopers jumped. Looking from the boundary of the Public Concession, it was not possible to see whether the paratroopers were carrying special equipment such as rifles or machine guns. According to the villagers near that area who entered the Public Concession, they were quite surprised by the sight. The wind direction changed, and the "balloons" drifted eastward. Some "balloons" seemed to be in danger of falling into the Huangpu River. However, they did not know if there were any casualties. It goes without saying that there were no people's defense forces shooting at the paratroopers in that area.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Japanese Planes Attacked Zhejiang and Jiangxi</p>
<p>It is found that the large numbers of Japanese bombers seen over the Public Concession recently were attacking Chinese troops in Ningbo, Zhapu, and Jiangxi Province. Observers saw that the Japanese planes were carrying as many as fifteen bombs, believed to be 250 pounds each. News from the Shanghai-Ningbo Railway area said that several Japanese regiments are currently heading to the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>One Unit of Japanese Troops Hastily Transferred Elsewhere</p>
<p>According to reliable sources in this city, a Japanese regiment arrived at the Yangshupu Barracks and boarded ships to be transferred elsewhere after only twenty-four hours. According to the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun*, the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai, which had been lifeless and silent since October of last year, will reopen this month to strengthen the diplomatic front line in the Far East. Last September, Fotokhritsky, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, secretly came to Shanghai and repeatedly met with Soviet consulate officials in Shanghai, Sherikov, Bachidin and other relevant staff. Then, it was decided to reopen and set up five sections under the Consulate General: General Affairs, Passport, Justice, Commerce, and News, which would be co-organized by five people dispatched from Moscow, five people dispatched from the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo, and ten people stationed in Shanghai. Now, in view of the changes in the situation in the Far East, in order to strengthen the Soviet diplomatic organization in the Far East, it has been decided to reopen in mid-month. The personnel stationed in Shanghai include Kurimiko, Arkus, Sherikov, and Ivankienko, among others. Their whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday afternoon, crowds gathered at the racetrack to watch the horse races. Suddenly, the sound of planes was heard, and they all looked up and saw 27 Japanese planes in tight formation, followed by another squadron of Japanese planes, also 27, flying overhead.</p>
<p>Many Believe Germans Are Involved in Training</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* also reported that Japanese army transport planes continued to conduct parachute exercises in the Jiangwan area this morning (the 15th). Some people believe that the Japanese army may soon imitate the methods of the German and Soviet armies and use paratroopers to fight against the Chinese army. Today and on the previous three days, large numbers of Japanese army transport planes, bombers, and fighters have been flying over Shanghai. Many believe that the main reason for the Japanese planes flying is to train Japanese troops here into a paratrooper force. It is also believed that several German "instructors" are currently assisting the Japanese army in conducting paratrooper training.</p>

<h3>Soviet Ships Arrive in Shanghai for Repairs; Four More Remain</h3>

Three ships have already returned to Vladivostok after repairs. Four ships are still undergoing repairs and docked at the Xiangfeng Shipyard in Pudong: Komiles, Soviet, Maxim Gorky, and Kovda, which arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. The most recent ships to return to Vladivostok were the Svir and Smolny. Both Soviet ships departed Shanghai empty. Another Soviet ship, Volkhov, loaded four to five thousand boxes of tea when it left Shanghai for Vladivostok. The above three ships have already arrived in Vladivostok. The four Soviet ships that have not left Shanghai do not currently have a departure date. All ships came to Shanghai for repairs. The rumor that they are operating a regular service in the Far East is unfounded.</p>

<h3>Japanese Arrest the Wu Family on Ferguson Road; Seize a Radio Transceiver and Two Bundles of Documents; Detain a Visiting Youth and Take Him to Hongkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:30 PM, more than ten Japanese plainclothes personnel, including one Chinese person, in three cars, two of which were military license plates (482) (187), and another black license plate (5139), went to the Louza French Concession Police Station and requested that detectives accompany them to search the residence of the Wang family at No. 218 Ferguson Road. The police authorities granted their request and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to accompany them to the address.</p>
<p>Searching the Wang Residence</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the location, the detectives and Japanese personnel knocked on the door and asked if Mr. Wang was at home. His family said that he was not at home. The Japanese personnel and detectives immediately conducted a thorough search of his residence, resulting in the seizure of two bundles of documents and a radio transceiver. After half an hour, the search was completed. Because the Wang person the Japanese personnel wanted to arrest had not yet returned home, they waited at the residence.</p>
<p>The Whole Family is Arrested</p>
<p>At about 5:00 PM, Mr. Wang finally returned to his residence in his private car, license plate (3136). As soon as he entered the house, he was arrested by the Japanese personnel. His wife, three children, three servants, and the driver were also arrested along with the seized items. It is said that they were first taken to the French police station, where they were detained for a while, and then Wang and his family were taken to Hongkou. Mr. Wang's name could not be investigated for the time being. According to a notice from the post office, due to transportation difficulties, all bulk and small packages to Hunan Province will be temporarily suspended from acceptance starting from the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>A Thousand Cans of Kerosene Consumed by Fire; Owners and Craftsmen Burned</h3>
<p>At 11:20 PM last night, a double-fronted tobacco and paper shop at No. 316 Mêling Road, Avenue Amiral de l'Orient, stored more than a thousand cans of kerosene. One of the cans had a slight crack in the lead, and the kerosene leaked out. The owner of the shop, He Guoxiang, immediately asked a coppersmith to solder the cracked area with tin. Unexpectedly, the kerosene caught fire and immediately burned fiercely, with thick smoke. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out. As a result, a thousand cans of kerosene and the building were consumed by the fire, resulting in huge losses. When the fire was raging, the owner He Guoxiang (58 years old) and the coppersmith Lu Rongsheng (26 years old) were severely burned. They were taken to Baolong Hospital by ambulance for treatment. Both are in serious condition and their lives may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Passengers from Detained Zhoushan Ships Disembark One After Another</h3>
<p>A total of five merchant ships have been detained in the waters of Zhoushan, some for more than two months. The release date is still unknown. Yesterday, it was learned that some of the passengers on these ships had disembarked in Zhoushan and transferred to other ships to Shanghai. According to passengers, the foreign ships detained in Zhoushan are still the Meifu, Changde, Ammanli, Jiangsu, and Afumariya. Except for the Changde and Avimariya, which only carried cargo, the other ships also carried passengers. Initially, the Japanese side prohibited passengers from disembarking, but the food and fuel supplies on the ships were limited. The passengers were stranded on the ships and almost had nothing to eat. At one point, local enthusiastic people raised funds to provide relief. After several negotiations with the Japanese side, they were recently allowed to disembark, but the crew members were still not allowed to leave the ships, and the cargo was not allowed to be unloaded.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police, Together with the Police, Attempt to Arrest He Yuanming; He Escapes Arrest Because he is Out; They Depart After Conducting a Search</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in this city dispatched several plainclothes military police officers in a car to the Louza French Concession Police Station, requesting that Chinese and Western detectives accompany them to No. 8, Lane 291, Route de Guignes, to arrest the accountant He Yuanming. When the Japanese military police and detectives arrived at He's residence, He had already left, so he was not arrested. After questioning his family and conducting a search, they found no important documents. The military police then left. The two lawyers, Yao Yunbo and Zhang Hongwei, and the former principal of Qianwu Lun Girls' High School, Zhu Lin, and Tong Muge, a teacher at Minli Girls' High School, who were arrested recently, are currently detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. It is said that the investigation has begun, but the reasons for the arrest are still unclear.</p>
<h3>Case of Plotting to Kidnap the Bei Family and Others; Criminals All Convicted; Bandit Vehicle Crashes into Manure Cart, Hostages Escape; Kidnapping and Extortion Still Under Investigation</h3>

<p>Plotting to Kidnap Yao Juyan; Extorting He Yingjie</p>
<p>The Chinese detective team led by Shan Zhaoxian, Gao Yongan, and Zhou Wenqing of the Lao Zha Police Station previously arrested five people, including Pang Ying (nicknamed Xiao Hei Hui) from Qingpu, Zhou Axing from Changzhou, Shen Zhongbao from Jiangbei, Wang Enzong from Shanghai, and a woman named Shen Wangshi, at No. 24 Jinyecun, Yidingpan Road, and No. 14, Lane 229, Weihaiwei Road.

It was found that Pang and others had kidnapped Dr. Yao Juyan at No. 869 Wuding Road at 6:00 PM on October 18 of last year and demanded a ransom. However, the bandits' vehicle crashed into a manure cart while passing Route des Soeurs. The bandits escaped, and Yao narrowly escaped danger. They also sent a letter to He Yingjie, the owner of the Xin Ya Rubber Printing Factory at No. 26, Lane 434, Route Paul Henry, at 2:00 PM on February 1 of this year, attempting to extort 310,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Court President Feng continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru BaoYi stated that Wang Sizong and Shen Wangshi were found to be unrelated and requested their release. As for Pang and the other three, it was feared that they had committed other crimes, so he requested a postponement. Court President Feng ordered the release of Tu Sizong and Shen Wangshi and ordered Pang Ying and others to be detained for a later interrogation.</p>
<p>Sending a Letter to a Leather Factory; Attempting to Extort 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Guben Leather Factory at No. 55, Lane 200, Guangdong Road, is owned by Zhang Ruzhou. At 7:30 PM on the 11th of this month, three young men suddenly delivered a letter to the factory, instructing it to be handed over to Zhang. The factory staff saw that the letter was bulging, as if there was something inside. They felt it and realized that it was a pistol bullet. They did not open it and immediately reported it to the lane patrol officer No. 1717, who gave chase and arrested Zhou Guiquan (23 years old) from Pudong on Henan Road. He was taken to the Central Police Station. The Chinese detective team led by Wu Chunrong, Yang Zhaoqing, and Tian Changyuan opened the letter, revealing an attempt to extort 100,000 yuan in national currency. The letter stated that a representative would be sent to collect the money the next day, otherwise "we will suffer a major disadvantage." It was signed "The First Unit of the National Protection Army." Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru BaoYi stated that the police were currently verifying the handwriting and investigating the accomplices, so he requested permission to postpone the interrogation. Court President Feng interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for a later interrogation.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Kills Infant; Scheduled to be Sent Back to the US</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Private First Class Keithmon (22 years old) of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai killed an infant aged one year and three months.

<h3>Xu Xiaolan Sues Tong Yuejuan to Confirm Parental Relationship; Defendant's Lawyer Firmly Denies, Saying Father's Name Wan Jilu Passed Away Long Ago</h3>
<p>Tong Yuejuan, formerly a Kunqu opera actress and now a movie star, has been married to the movie industry tycoon Zhang Shankun for many years. Recently, Xu Xiaolan (57 years old, residing at No. 35, Hequn Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour) from Hunan, through Lawyer Zhang Fukang, filed a lawsuit against Tong Yuejuan and Zhang Shankun in the Civil Mediation Office of the Special First Court, claiming that Tong was her biological daughter, originally named Xu Xingguan. However, because Tong and others did not acknowledge this, the mediation failed. This has been reported in detail. Xu still hired Lawyer Zhang to file a lawsuit against Tong Yuejuan in the Civil Court of the Special First Court to confirm the parent-child relationship. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff was originally from Hunan and lived in Hangzhou. She married Wu Baozhen, and the defendant was born to them at noon on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jia Yin year. Her name was Xingguan (nicknamed A Xing). Later, Wu took the daughter and left, and they have not been able to meet since. Now, she knows that her daughter has changed her name to Tong Yuejuan, has become a famous star in the stage and film industry, and has married Zhang Shankun. Because she does not recognize the plaintiff as her biological father, she is filing this lawsuit. (Zhang Shankun was not included as a defendant in this lawsuit). Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Wei'ao opened the Third Civil Court to hear the case. Tong Yuejuan did not attend, and Lawyer Yuan Yangan represented her in court, stating that Tong's age was 28, she was from Hangzhou, and lived at No. 543 Route Haig. The court then inquired about the facts from Xu Xiaolan herself. She replied that the defendant was born to her wife Wu on the 15th day of the seventh month of the Jia Yin year at noon in Xiaofen Lane No. 20, Hangzhou. At that time, she was working for the Wujiang County Government. In the Ji Wei year, Wu took her daughter and left, and her whereabouts were unknown. She once worked as the director of the watchhouse in the Shaoxing District Court. In 1934, a neighbor named Ding from Hangzhou told her that the defendant was performing on stage in Shanghai. She came to Shanghai once and went to the backstage of the stage to see the defendant, but she did not succeed. Later, she learned that she had married Zhang Shankun and had become a star, so she came to Shanghai to file this lawsuit, requesting that the defendant be confirmed as her biological daughter. Lawyer Yuan Yangan defended Tong Yuejuan, completely denying all the allegations made by the plaintiff. He said that the defendant's original name was Wan Xiuying, and her father, Wan Jilu, died in 1926. She and her mother, Wu, depended on each other. Later, she learned art from a teacher and changed her stage name to Tong Yuejuan. The plaintiff's request was like a bolt from the blue. Her biological mother, Wu, is still alive, but she does not know the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawsuit has no legal basis and should be dismissed. The court then ordered the parties to go outside for reconciliation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gambling King Escorted Back to the US; Seeking Pardon for Past Crimes; Lawyer Prepares Application; Signed by Foreign Nationals from Various Countries</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", Jack LaLaine, the king of slot machines in Shanghai, was sentenced to 18 months in McNeil Island Penitentiary for operating gambling. He is now being escorted back to the United States on the President Cleveland. However, Jack committed a theft in Oklahoma, USA, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison in that state.</p>
<p>He escaped in May 1925 after serving only two years. Therefore, if he returns to the United States, he may be sent back to Oklahoma prison after serving his sentence in McNeil Island Penitentiary to complete his 23-year sentence and another 10 years for escaping from prison. Mr. Luo Qiu, an American lawyer in Shanghai who defended Jack in the US Assessor's Office, in view of this, is currently preparing to</p>
<p>prepare an application to submit to the Governor of Oklahoma, requesting a full pardon for Jack's past crimes. Luo Qiu is unwilling to disclose the details of the application, only saying that Jack's friends will sign the application this week. It is believed that more than a thousand foreign nationals from more than ten countries living in Shanghai will sign the application.</p>

<h3>Each Has Different Skills</h3>
<p>— Chen Xinkui</p>
<p>Writing has "penmanship," fighting has "gunmanship," so how can a big businessman doing business not have a "rising method"?</p>
<p>There are many "rising methods," and each method is clever. The following are various methods that have been tested and have taken effect:</p>
<p>Steady and Sure Method - Raise the price by one cent today, wait two days, and then raise it by two cents. Then drop it by one cent, and raise it by two cents again. In this way, step by step, or take one step back and two steps forward. In less than two months, it will rise by twenty or thirty cents. For example, cooking oil, from about seventy cents to more than one yuan, rose up in this way.</p>
<p>Raise the Goods, Not the Price Method - The price increases slowly day by day, but the quality of the goods is reduced first. This is similar to raising the price in different ways. For example, with grass paper, when you buy a stack, you always feel that the number of sheets has shrunk a bit. It turns out that this is the trick.</p>
<p>Inferior Goods on the Market Method - Superior goods are locked up waiting to be sold at a good price. First, take inferior goods and sell them as superior goods. The price remains the same. This way, there is the practical benefit of raising the price without the bad name. Those who purchase the number one rice at the price of the number one rice should have learned this lesson well.</p>
<p>Want to Rise, But Fall Method - Rise and rise, rise in a daze. I simply don't even believe it myself. Sure enough, after rising sufficiently, business is no longer right. Then, let's turn a corner, show kindness, lower a little bit today, lower a little bit tomorrow. After three to five days, the hearts of the investors are moved. They are busy "digging" and "absorbing." So the price quickly rises again. This way, the store owner is proud because the price has risen. The speculators are also proud because they are sure that the goods will rise again. Only the poor citizens are extremely unlucky, buying one day, more expensive another. The current soap and matches fully demonstrate this posture.</p>
<p>Running and Jumping Method - Strangely enough, when the rising wind blows, business is actually better. The bosses are so happy that their mouths are always open. At this point, the well-written, one-tenth increase in price is no longer in line with the needs of the times. One can only greet and catch up by running and jumping. Please look at the price of US dollars. Although it often hovered around eighteen yuan within two months, the retail price of Mobil Oil soared from seventeen or eighteen yuan to twenty-three or four yuan per tin. Is this clear example not clear enough?</p>
<p>Great Rise and Special Rise Method - After the price rises, it must rise again, it must rise again, but public opinion does not allow it, people's words are terrible, so one must use a smokescreen. First, create a tense atmosphere, and then create a big rumor. Then, twist and turn and come up with a set of announcements. Everything is prepared and ready. Immediately, the United Front is launched. The word "horizontal" is at the forefront. Show a fierce energy, be bold, and ignore whether to raise it! Anyway, one will be scolded the same way. Raise it thoroughly, completely! This kind of rising method requires a large capital operation. Naturally, only rice and coal are eligible for such a qualification.</p>
<p>In addition, there are the "revision of price method", "united price increase method", "bitter crying method", "want money not life method", and "what method and everything method" ... The "rising method" of big businessmen is endless, and my "stomach talent" is small, and the space here is limited, so how can I write so much. Fortunately, the poor also have a "method".

<p>(One sent from Holland) On the occasion of congratulating Yu on the publication of Jing Yuan Tang Poetry and Painting Collection</p>
<p>In early years, we shared pure conversations by the window, You held high positions and governed the nation, Your blessings, wisdom, and literary talent are unparalleled, Your talent and style are unmatched in the world. Searching for secluded northern homes thousands of miles away, Entering my dreams like the weeping lake, I pour a jar of tears, The phoenixes and cranes sing in the sky, I recall the spring river in the sound of painting eyebrows. Believing in the death of people and the exhaustion of the nation, My sorrow increases with time year after year, The three-life bond in vain neighbours the old, Leading the world in sorrow and toil, 廉政 is unparalleled, Grass and trees, weapons and soldiers, together with Du Fu, Separation and turmoil, sorghum and millet, different from Tao Qian, Exerting effort to be upright and brave, worthy of remembrance, One pillar resists the torrent, knowing it is dangerous and severe.</p>
<p>In Memory of Mr. Zhang Yunhe's Love of Freedom</p>
<p>Sheng</p>
<p>The great newspaper has a glorious history, High literary talent decorates Zhang, Writing flowers bloom in the upper seat, Spiritual aura resides in the new hall, The unveiling is like the spirit still present, Poetry and diction share the long love, The footsteps of Jin are now silent, The love of freedom is like a cool dream lamp.</p>
<p>A Sentimental Reflection on a Fine Day</p>
<p>Eternal grief fills today, Long sleep is contrary to spring, Before the terrace, the river swallows speak, Remaining dreams are like sea bubbles, The distant shore is hard to bid farewell, Filling the sky and wanting truth, Darkly, eternally, Blowing tears fill the handkerchief.</p>
<h3>Letters from Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Scholar</p>
<p>—Telling You About Some Living Conditions—</p>
<p>The business of secondhand shops is most developed in Sichuan, all arising in response to needs. Prices are shockingly high; ordinary salaried workers can't afford new goods, so they have to go to secondhand shops to find what they need. As a result, secondhand shops are everywhere. Within half a year, more than seventy have opened in Chengdu, and more than ten have opened in Leshan within two months. This is a money-making business with no investment. People with used goods entrust them to secondhand shops to sell on their behalf, and the shopkeeper earns a large commission after the sale. Every one of these shops makes money, but they will all gradually close down later. One reason is that there are too many such shops; the second is that the items brought from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have now decreased; postal items have also decreased; and the lack of secondhand goods makes it impossible to do business.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I bought a set of Zhanghua gray serge suits in Leshan for fifty yuan. After wearing them for two years, the rear of the trousers was about to be worn through. Recently, I sent them to a secondhand shop for sale, and the result was that they were sold for 210 silver dollars. After deducting a 10% handling fee, I actually got 189 yuan. Wearing them for two years made me 140 yuan instead. However, when this suit was made, rice here sold for six cents a catty, and fifty yuan could buy 834 catties of rice. Now, fifty yuan has become 189 yuan, which is such a big interest, but calculated at the current rice price of 260 yuan per picul, I can only buy 127 catties of rice, losing 707 yuan instead.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Leshan, a haircut only cost eight cents, and a bath only cost twenty cents. Last November, haircuts and baths still only cost fifty cents each. Now, a single haircut costs three yuan, applying yellow Vaseline costs an additional sixty cents, applying white Vaseline costs an additional one yuan, shampooing costs an additional one yuan, a back massage costs an additional one yuan, and applying Florida Water or Snow Cream costs an additional one yuan. A single bath costs five yuan, a back scrub costs an additional five yuan, a full body scrub costs an additional ten yuan, and a pedicure costs an additional six yuan. If you want to use charcoal to warm the cold water, it costs an additional three yuan. In just four short months, the changes are so great. I originally got a haircut twice a month, but now I have to change to once every forty days. I used to take a bath once a week, but now I'll have to give it up forever. University professors are not as good as craftsmen and coolies.</p>
<p>However, apart from the salaried class, other people still get haircuts, take baths, smoke cigarettes, and go to restaurants as before, without any stinginess, and completely indifferent. What's most annoying is getting clothes made: the customers of Western-style tailors are now mostly some nondescript lower-class people, six hundred yuan for a suit, eight hundred yuan for a suit, a thousand yuan for a coat, letting the tailor boss set the price, almost without even haggling; while white-faced scholars are almost extinct, and if they want to add clothes, they can only go to consignment shops to buy secondhand goods. A Western-style clothing store opened by one of my teaching assistants and a Ningbo tailor now makes a net profit of six thousand yuan per month, which, calculated on an annual basis, allows each person to earn thirty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>When merchants invite guests, they often offer "Big Cannon Platform" cigarettes to their guests. "Big Cannon Platform" cigarettes now sell for 36 yuan a can here. Among the more than 200 faculty members here, not one can afford to smoke "British Brand" cigarettes. They can only smoke the incredibly spicy local sun-cured tobacco. (Letter of March 17th)</p>
<h3>Someone is Burning Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ji</p>
<p>Aren't they? Many people are burning banknotes. Even though they are very poor.</p>
<p>She or they, light the banknotes one by one, burn them to ashes, and the ashes fly in the air, like pairs of pink butterflies. Then they laugh, as if they have done something satisfying.</p>
<p>A stack of Hangzhou foil costs at least 1.2 yuan. Each stack has 90 sheets, making each sheet worth 1.3 fen in national currency.</p>
<p>The old lady next door bought six boxes of "yuanbao" folded from tin foil last night. I secretly calculated for her that each "yuanbao" is worth about 2 fen in national currency.</p>
<p>Aren't they! Many people are burning banknotes. I don't know who left the nonsense: "Burnt tin foil is currency used by ghosts."</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, even more people burn banknotes. You can only see smoke here and smoke there, and pink butterflies fill the sky. I can't guess what the psychology is.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Tai Shou'ou</p>
<p>(6) The Crystallization of Love</p>
<p>When he was urged by several senior colleagues to rush to Shenyang to sing a show, he estimated that the date of Xiangqi's delivery was only thirty or forty days away. The problem of the child was on his mind day and night. When he went on stage, he couldn't think of singing the play with energy. In a four- or five-flower cave show, everyone else was desperately trying to stand out, but he almost forgot the words and almost couldn't get off the stage.</p>
<p>He stayed in Shenyang for five days. Everyone else was excitedly running around everywhere, but he only went to the Japanese concession once.</p>
<p>On the morning of the day he was leaving, Jin Daguo and Rong Kui and a group of people all went to the street to buy things, but Begonia stayed alone in the hotel, lying listlessly on the bed in a daze; he didn't know how much time had passed before he suddenly noticed that someone had come into the room.</p>
<p>"I've seen that you've been troubled these past few days, and I couldn't help but come to see you!" The one who spoke was Zhao Yukun, with a shaved head and an open collar, speaking very directly, moving lightly, and without a sound; more than half a year had passed since they last met, and nothing had changed, except that today it was still early, and surprisingly, there wasn't a trace of drunkenness on his face.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you?" This was not what Begonia had expected, and he felt much happier in his heart.</p>
<p>"Who else would it be but me?" As he spoke, he made another funny face as usual.</p>
<p>"So, the grass-on-flying character in these few days' performances must be you!" Begonia immediately jumped up from the bed, happily took Yukun's hand and said, "You are really strange. After leaving Tianjin, you actually came to the northeast. What's going on?"</p>
<p>"What's going on? I'll tell you! I need to eat!" Yukun saw him stand up, so he lay down himself. "If you want to ask me why I changed this name, isn't it just like you changed the three words Wu Yuqin to Begonia?"</p>
<p>"I see you're doing pretty well, aren't you?" Begonia didn't stand on ceremony with him, so he pulled up a chair and sat down by the edge of the bed (82)</p>

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>After Watching "Hong Xuanjiao"</h3>
<p>— Meng Gongwei</p>
<p>History is a mirror. The performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" provides the audience with what Hong Xuanjiao said in the fifth act: "This is a terrible memory, no, this is a lesson in blood!" The same is true for the China Travel Troupe itself. Hong Xiuquan (played by Tang Huaiqiu) said before his death: "Such destruction is also good! It can also let our descendants know a hundred years later that in the face of a strong enemy, if our own internal factions can unite with each other, understand each other, take into account the common interests, and move forward with all sincerity under a common desire, the future—is really terrible!" The excitement of the emotions on and off the stage is not without reason.</p>
<p>Wei Ruohui used his historian's Spring and Autumn Annals style in "Hong Guan Jiao" to point out the reasons for the demise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (see "Before the Premiere"), and he expressed his infinite grief and indignation towards those like Yang Xiuqing who "wielded military power and monopolized conquests" to eliminate dissidents, sat idly by and did not offer help, and even did not hesitate to trap friendly forces to death, allowing the Qing soldiers to fulfill their wish to use Yi to control Han. He made us feel like we had swallowed a piece of burning iron, our hearts were burning, our tears were flowing, replacing the words that were too hot to speak.</p>
<p>Director Fei Mu is directing a stage play in Shanghai for the first time. He is a famous director in the film industry, so his directing techniques are different from those of ordinary stage directors. He pays special attention to the atmosphere of each scene, especially the fourth and fifth acts. The change in the atmosphere is just like what we have seen in his films, manipulating it as he pleases. The orderly and intense war scenes have never been seen on the stage before. If the greatest advantage of "Hong Xuanjiao" is the playwright's surging passion, then strengthening the theme without letting it become an unbridled horse should be the director's achievement. The application of film techniques to the stage has opened up a new path for the stage world in the future, and is one of the greatest gains of "Hong Yijiao."</p>
<p>In terms of actors: Tang Ruoqing almost single-handedly supported one act in the fifth act, which is her "killer mace." Tang Huaiqiu is an old stage general, but he has not performed a good play since returning to Shanghai this time. In the fourth act of "Hong Yijiao," he regained his brilliance, making people believe that his heroic spirit is still there. Shao Hua's Yang Xiuqing performed very well in the first two acts, but the third act was not suave enough. Ge Xin's Shi Dakai still lacked composure and firmness. Liao Fan's Zhang Changhui was sometimes overly rude.</p>
<p>The lighting in this play can be said to be very good, benefiting greatly from the structure of the Lyceum Theatre. Xiao Wu was very good in the fourth and fifth acts, but worse in the first three acts. If more people had sung the Man Jiang Hong song, it would have been better. As it is, only one or two people sing, which is not enough.</p>
<h3>Theatrical News</h3>
<p>— Juexin</p>
<p>Xiao Yang Yuelou has been away from Shanghai for two years. His daughter, Yang Juping, has always followed him, but recently she has also reached a position where she can stand on her own, so she left her father to perform alone, hanging the "leading lady" sign.</p>
<p>They have been stationed in Tianjin for a long time. Now, they have gone from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan, and from Shanhaiguan to Tangshan, performing at the Yongsheng Grand Theatre. Cooperating with Juping is a young martial arts actor, Guo Yukun. They are both pillars of the stage, taking turns performing the main show.</p>
<p>A letter from a friend brought good news that Yang Juping and Guo Yukun have gotten engaged and have scheduled a wedding ceremony to be held in Shanghai in the second half of the year. Before, when they were in Shanghai, they were already very "close." Now, "lovers are finally united."</p>
<h3>The Performance Rights of "The Biography of Yang E"</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Xin Yi Internally Designates it as the Second Work; Tian Feng Also Lists it in the Preview Repertoire</p>
<p>Amidst the performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" by the China Travel Troupe, we have also received a pleasant piece of news, which is that Mr. Wei Ruohui's "The Biography of Yang E," following "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" and "Hero of the Sea," has been internally designated by the Xin Yi Drama Club as its second work. Moreover, the responsible personnel of Xin Yi are already making active plans, preparing to perform it in a short period of time.</p>
<p>We remember that Xin Yi's debut work, "Hero of the Sea," was performed during the most adverse days of time and place, but the recommendation of public opinion and the praise of the audience finally made "Hero of the Sea" have an excellent page in the history of the troupe!</p>
<p>Although the basic staff (including actors) of Xin Yi is weak, under a common will and a unified front, the public is willing to cooperate in terms of manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Tian Feng Drama Troupe, organized by Tian Feng Company, also announced the news that "The Biography of Yang E" will be performed. Xin Yi, of course, felt very suspicious about this and immediately went to the original playwright, Wei Ruohui, to inquire. The result was that Wei Ruohui was also surprised because Tian Feng had not obtained his permission.</p>
<p>But according to news from Da Feng, "This has already been contacted with Wei Ruohui, and a portion of the payment has already been sent."</p>
<p>Whether there is a misunderstanding in the middle, we do not know now, but we only hope that "The Biography of Yang E" will be performed soon, and we do not hope that there will be a "The Biography of Yang E" dispute.</p>
<h3>Wei Ruohui's Original Letter to Xin Yi</h3>
<p>Dear Sir: I have heard that "The Biography of Yang E" was transferred to Tian Feng for rehearsal and that I had received a portion of the performance tax in advance. The facts of the matter are slightly different from what is published in the newspapers. According to Tian Feng, the two plays "Empress Dowager Cixi" and "The Biography of Yang E" were announced in advance. I did not know about it beforehand, or it may have been that a friend acted on my behalf without informing me, which cannot be determined; because many of Tian Feng's responsible persons are old friends of mine. However, Mr. Zhao Zhiyou of "The Biography of Yang E" contacted me twice, first hoping that the play could be transferred to Tian Feng for performance, and second hoping that it could be performed jointly by Xin Yi and Tian Feng. I immediately told him that the play had already been announced by Xin Yi and that the approval of the Xin Yi Standing Committee was required. As for what Tian Feng's lawyer said at the reception for news reporters about Ms. Ying Yin transferring a "portion of the payment," I have not received a single cent, and I do not know if there is any error in this. I hereby reply to this letter, hoping you will check it. Wei Ruohui respectfully. April 15.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Beauty in Transient Drunkenness by the Brocade Zither</p>
<p>Li Xin thought he had an opportunity to take advantage of and had a well-thought-out plan in his mind. So, on this night, he deliberately joked and flirted with Red Maiden, being particularly intimate, and wanted to have a moonlit drink with her. Red Maiden naturally agreed and instructed the kitchen to prepare some delicious dishes, opened a jar of aged wine, and sat facing Li Xin in the courtyard, drinking and chatting idly. At this time, it was between midnight and one o'clock, the moon was almost full, and the moonlight was very good, shining brightly in the courtyard. Li Xin and Red Maiden each drank two or three cups of wine, then Li Xin took out a dongxiao flute and played it mournfully, very pleasant to hear. After playing a tune, he poured wine again and urged Red Maiden to drink several cups. Red Maiden's alcohol tolerance was usually very low, but tonight she was very happy in her heart and drank several more cups. Her cheeks were as red as roses, and she was quite drunk. She said to Li Xin in a delicate voice, "I've had enough to drink and can't drink anymore. It's better to go to sleep early." Li Xin said with a smile, "Let's drink three more cups before we go back to our rooms, otherwise we'll be letting down the bright moon." Red Maiden was forced to drink by Li Xin and drank three more cups. She became so drunk that her words were slurred and she couldn't support herself. Li Xin then instructed people to remove the leftovers and picked up Red Maiden, pretending to say, "Why are you so drunk? Let me carry you to sleep." Red Maiden did not answer, her delicate body lying on Li Xin, letting Li Xin do whatever he wanted. Li Xin carried her into the room, laid her down on the bed, and Red Maiden began to snore. Li Xin saw that she was fast asleep. This was a rare opportunity. He could have killed her with one knife to eliminate future troubles, but because he had a month of love with her, and she had treated him with true love and had not treated him wrongly, it would be too cruel and ruthless to kill her while she was drunk. He only needed to escape down the mountain. After thinking about it, he pulled a thin quilt over her body, took some silver from the drawer, hid it on his body, walked out of the room, and gently closed the door. He went outside and stole a precious sword, wore it on his waist for self-defense. Fortunately, no one noticed. He quietly walked to the back of the寨, stole a mount from the stable, mounted it, and lashed it several times, galloping down the mountain. The moonlight shone on the mountain path, very clear. He descended from Qing Shi Mountain, put his hand to his forehead, and secretly rejoiced. (39)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Life in Struggle</h3>
<p>There are only three weapons for struggle: knowledge, ambition, and courage. Cultivating knowledge, cultivating ambition, and cultivating courage are the skills of self-cultivation. The psychological construction of struggle has been generally discussed. If you want to obtain systematic thought and how to put it into practice, you can read my book "The Life of Struggle" carefully. Next time, I will change the topic to discuss the philosophy of action.</p>
