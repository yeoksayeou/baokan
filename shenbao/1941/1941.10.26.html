<p>美國一部份援蘇物資決定改變航綫之後，日本方面沾沾自喜，硬說這是美國對日讓步，並以外交勝利自炫，但據一昨華盛頓方面的解釋，則根本上不過是一種適應需要的技術措置，因爲經由海參崴運蘇，需時十日，如果取道亞爾干日爾，則僅需四十八小時，在這紅軍企待接濟萬分迫切的時候，美國不顧德國在北極海方面所可發動的威脅破壞，毅然決定採取較爲艱險但事實上却是較短的航綫，似乎正足以表示美國援蘇的積極和勇敢，奈何便曲解爲對日綏靖？唯一可訾議的，是航務委員會縱有這樣的決定，根本不必公開發表文告，予以宣佈，致蒙「以有用情報供給德國剽襲艦」之譏，怪不得此一文告發表之後，國務院白宮以及英蘇兩國使館均爲之感覺詫異，</p>
<p>赤裸裸講，東條組閣的主要意義，祇在造成一個便於隨時行動的局面，過去徒以日本國力已因對華作戰消耗過半，以及遠東反侵略陣綫早已相當堅强兩重原故，所以非有「適當機會」，不敢貿然從事規模過大或冒險過多的行動；假使這一機會突然出現，則相信美國即使綏靖，恐也休想能拉得住日本，像改變援蘇物資航綫這一類間接而又間接的「小惠」，尤其談不到能使日本止步。何况退一步講，即使假定美國航運委員會此一決定，與目前尙在進行中的美日談話不無關聯，但事實上此項談話旣毫無業已完成的跡象，則美國政府縱有綏靖日本之意，也用不着不待談話結束，便提前滿足日方的要求，因爲如果吾人記憶不錯的話，似乎這次美國對日談話的基本原則，是在以經濟讓步換取日本的放棄侵略，今茲日本不但尙未提供任何保證，反而出現了一個較前更急進的內閣，在這種情形之下，美國更沒有前倨後恭，自貶身價的理由。</p>
<p>或謂美國一則鑒於蘇聯前綫戰事頗呈嚴重，二則納粹在大西洋上的威脅又日見迫近，所以不得不暫時對日委蛇，以避免兩面作戰的危險，此說在表面上似乎言之成理，但若進一步加以剖析，則仍爲似是而非之談，第一，這幾天莫斯科形勢非常危急，固係事實，然觀於紅軍抵抗力量依然堅强，遷都及調集援軍各種舉措、依然井然有秩，可信莫京即使陷落，史達林決不致棄戰言和，一如法國所爲，加以轉瞬冬令，納粹即使奪得紅都，今後的攻勢，在冰天雪地的環境之下，恐怕也非經過一相當時期的補充準備，絕難再接再厲。第二，大西洋威脅雖大，但英國的實力堅强完整，當然尙堪一用，過去所以始終不肯貿然在西歐開闢第二戰塲，相信其根本用意，即係着眼於此；所以爲美國計，當前的問題，祇在如何武裝商船，如何實行護航，以各種必要的軍械物質充分供給英蘇　俾一方使紅軍仍能繼續抗戰　另一方使英國在納粹凶鋒萬一西轉時，得以有備無患的姿態，作堅强有效的迎戰；故在英國未有不支徵象之前，美國根本上還談不到參加歐戰問題，德國潛艇的一再襲擊美艦，雖無疑地意在刺激美國，迫其提早宣戰，俾予日本以行動機會，但觀於華盛頓政府的始終持重，可知其早已洞燭其奸，決不致草率從事，墮入納粹誘導美國兩面應戰的毒計。從這一點講，祇要英蘇兩國力足拖住軸心，美國在大西洋參戰的準備即使完成，參戰的機運即使成熟，也仍以愈遲參加爲愈佳，原因是美國在參加歐戰之前，必須先在太平洋上解除後顧之憂，決不是綏靖政策所得濟事，因爲暫時的綏靖，等於予對方以伺機襲擊的機會，這一點常識，相信素來對於侵略陣綫認識最深的羅斯福總統，必能透澈領悟。</p>
<p>綜上所述，吾人殆敢斷言美國決無綏靖日本的意思，因爲不僅無此需要，抑且明知行之無益；如果推而廣之，吾人更不妨斷言美國今後不參加歐戰則已，若果參戰，則必在事前把遠東方面的隱患，先行解除，而且決不是用綏靖手段去解除，因爲這種綏靖，等於自掘陷阱，決非一個準備參戰的國家所樂爲，至於在這種局勢未出現之前，則祗有間接借重他人的力量，去消耗搆成這一隱患的力量，換句話說，祗有協助中國去打擊日本，正如其協助英蘇去打擊德國一樣。關於這一層，美國海長諾克斯上校隔昨所發「美日衝突終難避免」的言論，似乎正是一個有力佐證。</p>

<h3 id="c27">法國人的苦悶 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>我作此文的主旨，並不是要說明法國何以會瓦解，或是　咎於任何人，或仟何團體，或任何思想系統。這一件事，已由比我資格更高的人去做了。我並無何種野心，要在當時身居法國，親歷一九四〇年五六兩月空前巨變者的見解之外，再加上我個人的意見。</p>
<p>而且我雖然是一個法國人，當這巨變發生的時候，我却還在海外，身居美國，我的觀點，當然不免要受一已所處環境的影響。</p>
<p>可是禁不住要想。實則像我的許多同志一樣，幾個月來，我很想得到某種的結論，並以極審愼的態度，謀解決因法國失敗所引起的問題，不僅是對於法國人的問題，而且是對於不願放棄自由判斷像美國人者所引起的問題，我當然知道我身在美國，有思想，言論，著作的自由，而獲得絕大的利益。可是我也知道無論我的思想如何，據我現在法國的同志看來，俱無所用，祇因爲我可以享受最足自豪的自由，而他們却已失去這自由了。</p>
<p>因此我所得到的結論，別無其他價値，祇不過爲一個偶然做了法國人，而父無法知道他的思想感情，是否能與身居分崩離析的法國者相同的個人意見而己。</p>
<p>據我看來，法國現狀的基本因素，有下列諸點：</p>
<p>（一）波爾多政府請求休戰的第一着錯誤，就是假定法國已經戰敗，英國也不能再支持到幾星期以上。</p>
<p>（二）一着旣錯，便引起許多無可挽救的困難，致有維希政府使人草測的政策，和無法解決的心理衝突，一方面，對於英國的獲勝重生希望，但仍以爲過於不可思議，一方面則有相信戰敗者祇能和戰勝者携手合作，方有挽回的現實主義派。</p>
<p>（三）民衆對於德人的仇視，事實上是日益加甚。</p>
<p>（四）法國所處地位，具有永久的流動性，法人雖欲自謀解決，實際此戰爭已包括全世界，而且日在擴大之中，欲於此時期推想將來，這是無從想起的。</p>
<p>關於第一點，當波爾多會議的時候，法人深信英國在法軍戰敗以後，不能再支撑多少星期，最後始決定法國應向德國請求休戰，經長時間的辯論以後，並決定政府應留駐法國，這一件事實，我不曾　　　一個法國人有何異議。　伐　如何說服勒勃倫總統，使　放　赴菲計劃的經過情形，可在維希政府的正式報吿中看到。魏剛將軍似乎在索未河抵抗失敗以後，首先建議休戰，貝當元帥和其他許多人便很快的附和這個建議。</p>
<p>下面這一件事，足以證明一般人都相信英國決不能單獨抵抗德國的進攻。</p>
<p>當法國休戰代表團在貢比臬辨論休戰條件的時候，法國保證不再援英的一條也在討論之列。法國代表團中有一人說道：「觀於英國不久便將退出戰爭的事實，此一條豈不是多餘的嗎？」德國季台爾將軍却答說，他當然希望那位法國朋友的話是不錯的，但德軍却不能這樣的希圖僥倖。</p>
<p>假使當時法國領袖，能預見英國抵抗的成功，他們就可採取許多別種路綫，只是到了今日，再去臆測，已無所用了。波蘭的形勢遠不如法國，但仍能抗戰到底。法國戰敗以後，英國的地位已岌岌可危，在納粹現實主義者的眼光中看來，幾已絕望，而邱吉爾却不顧他同盟國的失敗，決定繼續抗戰。可是法國的將領和多數政治領袖，已確信法國的戰敗即是戰爭的結束。（未完）</p>

<p>穩定滬法幣為主要任務　對外匯管理作實際研討</p>
<p>據昨日所得可靠消息、自英美經濟專家聶梅雅，柯克蘭來華後、對中國戰時經濟問題、曾先後在港渝兩地、與中國方面官員、歴次舉行會議、聞已有重要決定、穩定上海法幣、即爲目的之一、惟在新措施付諸實施前、將廣微港滬金融界之意見、以供委考、柯克蘭氏來滬、即負有此種任務、</p>
<p>在滬將有　兩周勾留</p>
<p>柯克蘭氏已於昨日下午四時二十分、由香港乘怡和公司明生輸抵滬、在外灘羅斯福碼頭登陸、美國駐滬總領事洛克赫德、親赴輪埠迎迓、柯氏於抵滬時、守口如瓶、對往訪記者所詢各問題、均婉拒答復、據悉、柯氏將以平準會經濟專家資格、與滬銀行界討論穩定滬法幣問題、並將調查平準會在滬管理外匯工作情形、同時聆取本市商界方面之報吿、俾知美國實施凍結令後所引起之後果、在滬將有兩星期之勾留、然後返港復命、並聞平準會與英美經濟專家、對管理外匯問題、將於下月在港召集一重要會議、聶梅雅氏現方在渝、稍待即赴港出席、柯氏是否趕往參加、迄咋尙無確實消息、惟外間謠傳謂中國政府將放棄上海市塲之消息、則證之上述種種情形、則不攻自破矣、</p>
<p>精密研究　實際情況</p>
<p>關於柯克蘭氏此行來滬之使命、雖原則上與以前平準會美委福克斯·暨其帮辦泰萊博士之來滬、大同小異、但柯氏此來、適在重慶三國經濟會議之後、而又値香港金融會議舉行之時、實有特殊之意義、據消息靈通人士意見、柯氏此來之使命、將確實調查上海進口貿易情形、以及上海市塲對於物品進口需要之程度、研究上海各國商務利益錯綜複雜之狀况、並規定分辨友邦國家及非友邦國家之地位、考察上海畸形黑市外滙之眞情、探究其所以生成之原因及防杜之方法、決定平準基金委員會核給上海貨物進口所需外滙之數量、將使各種貿易均受其惠、而勿由少數特殊貿易獨享優越外滙、</p>

<p>外滙問題　或即解決</p>
<p>按海格氏曾在香港作長時期之勾留、與平準會作數度洽商、以期獲得充份外滙、俾本市電影院可繼續營業、不受美國凍結令之影響、據海格氏稱、渠已將此行經過情形、報吿亞洲影業公司當局、此後是否能繼續營業之問題、即可解決、又有影片商數人對記者談、亦認爲除非獲得充份外滙、滙至美國支付片價、則勢將停止營業、設美影片商停止營業、則上海所需要之美國影片來源勢將斷絕、據影片商意見、最近重慶官塲方面、要求進口大量美國影片、運往自由中國、則平準會對彼等要求、自應加以考慮、</p>

<h3 id="c43">工部局平米　供應絕無問題 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>倘米店拒售可報捕究辦　米市塲暗中交易待制止</p>
<p>工部局頃發布吿略稱、據報近有若干經售本局洋米之米店、藉口存貨吿罄、拒絕發售、爲此再發布吿、市民倘有發現上項情事、務希立即就近報吿捕房、以憑核辦、同時不論何人或任何團體、除購備自用外、不准購買本局洋米、並不得採購超過一個月之用量、本局現有充分之存到洋米供給、足以應付一切需要、關於供應一層、絕無堪以顧慮之理由、</p>
<p>下午米市　亟待制止</p>
<p>愛多亞路十五號雜糧油餅交易所同業買賣規章、雖經一再頒訂、卒因受投機市儈作崇影響、所有規章、不無等於具文、而尤以禁絕下午米糧交易、除該業公會一再通吿禁止外、同時法租界警務處亦曾命令遵照在案、但若輩米奸竟陽奉陰違、胆敢故遠足章、每日下午仍在該市塲暗中買賣米糧、並故意將市價做高、貽害民食匪淺、截至目前益趨盛熾、此種非法交易、若再繼續蔓延、則民食前途、勢將遭受嚴重影響、今望法租界當局予以尅日派員澈查該市塲黑市、藉以穩定市况、</p>
<p>米市竟以　黃金作價</p>
<p>本市民食存底之充沛、爲最近數十年來所罕見、而尤以戰爭以來之最豐厚時期、况國洋米來源、仍蟬聯於途、每月運滬數額、甚爲可觀、根據江海關報吿、九月份洋米運滬總達四四七·六七三公担、價値四·七五一關金、合値國幣一二·七三五·七六一元、同時國米運滬亦較過去便利湧旺、民食前途何處、但一般米商竟一味以撈獲非法利潤爲目的、以致整個米市倐鬆倏緊、恐慌卒難解除、但最近米商在塲買賣、竟以黃金漲跌爲作價、此種不法情事、殊不能容共繼續存在、亟待當局嚴厲禁絕、</p>
<p>消費合作　可收宏效</p>
<p>我人就現狀加以觀察、即可知數年來大部份商業、俱有祇圖近利、不顧後果之心理、一年前曾建議制止物價高漲、而使物價與貨幣購買力相符合之唯一辦法、厥爲組織一消費者協會、該會應有廣大權力、在必要時、可舉辦消費合作事業、售與會員之物品、祇收最低利益、換言之、該會可左右日用必需品之價格、使民衆可以生活、不僅餬口而已、</p>
<p>黑市交易　斷絕往還</p>
<p>現法公董局及工部局、已實行管理物價、惟　獲一部份之效果、現聞雙方又在考慮規定物價、恐所得者亦屬一部份之成功耳、何故、蓋未得有力之消費者協會爲之作後盾也，如有消費者協會之組織、則可與當局合作、該會會員、將一致拒絕向黑市或未經註冊之商人購買超過規定售價之貨物</p>
<p>違法交易　應予處分</p>
<p>英國人民、有向未經註册之商人按照超過政府規定價格購貨、終至此等違法者、即僱客與貨主、俱將受罰款處分、今工部局亦將施行此辦法耶、如囤積汽油者、罰款三十元、此舉並不能禁止囤積、適足以鼓勵囤積、總之、在無論何種管理物價辦法中、設無消費者及註冊之商人爲之作後盾、管理物價、殊難成功也、</p>
<p>囤積貨品　前途危險</p>
<p>深恐戰事爆發而囤積貨品以圖抬價出售者、應就實際利害、加以考量、設戰祌果因日本攻擊英美而光臨上海、則不論何方佔領上海、不論為軍隊需要或民衆需要、此等滿儲貨物之倉庫、無疑均將被徵用、可知戰時囤積貨物、誠足自食其果、希望獲利者、勢將失利、屆時一般人民、亦將認爲囤戶應與社會大衆、應患難相同、而無人同情其所受之損害矣、</p>
<p>中外人士　利害相同</p>
<p>現時戰爭未必光臨、而囤積漁利者、仍復存在、則將放任彼等以貨倉製成之手槍、向人民爲所欲爲、若中外人士消費者協會之組織、則彼等又何能胡作胡爲、總之、物價問題對於中外人士、實具同一意義、即爲貨幣購買力問題、深信堅强之消費者協會、可解決種種消費問題、並使兩租界當局所遭遇之困難、得以解決、而數百萬人民之購買力亦得以增高</p>

<p>析產辦法</p>
<p>並不合法、因羅迦陵乃一華人而非英國公民、查哈同遺產之爭奪、於十月三日羅迦陵去世之前、即已開始、緣上月間有居報達者十人、俱姓哈同、要求析產百分之六五·二、並謂此數乃伊拉克之遺產法所規定者、蓋故哈同原籍伊拉克、後改入英籍也、日律師岡本受此十人之託、向羅迦陵</p>

<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」，這是現代兒童很足引以自豪的。可是小朋友們不要忘記，二十世紀也是個科學的世紀。所以，二十世紀的兒童，都要有一個科學的頭腦和一雙科學的手，來應付這二十世紀的科學世紀，才配做這世紀的主人翁。</p>
<p>小朋友在學校裹學習的「自然」，便是增進你們科學知識的學科，能把你們的頭腦變成一個科學的頭腦。你們應該用心去學習，深　地　考，細細地研究，求個澈底的明白。在課外，還要多看科學的書報，並且常和大自然接觸，實地觀察自然界的一切事物，獲取豐富的科學知識，以充實你的科學頭腦。</p>
<p>光是一個科學的頭腦，還是不行，更要加上一雙科學的手。「用手又用腦，才是大好老！」你們見過這個標語嗎？在實騐之中，才可以造成一雙科學的手。所以，你們有了科學的知識，就該親自動手，去做科學實騐。</p>
<p>這樣手腦結合起來，不但可以增加研究的興味，而且還能創造新的事物。要知道，任何偉大的發明家，他們也不是什麼天生的怪人，我們的腦和手，和他們並沒有兩樣，有爲者亦若是。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！現在我們的國家正在苦難中奮　，我們還不急起直追，負起推進科學的使命，迎頭趕上去嗎？</p>
<p>有一天鴨哥哥和鷄弟弟一同出門遊玩，半路上鷄弟弟不見了；鴨哥哥找了許久，找不到它，小朋友！你們能不能代它找到嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c73">扶輪社與舊玩具 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>扶輪社這個名詞，我們也許已聽熱了吧？這是一個團體，組織的方法和別個團體不同。不拘國籍，各國的士女，都可加入，每星期開會一次，召集人由社員輪值，扶輪社的名稱，就因此而來。而且開會的時候，也不拘儀式，特別的一點，就是社員集會，絕對不談政治問題。</p>
<p>扶輪社的歷史，到現在還祇三十多年。當初僅由　國芝加哥幾個人發起這個團體，可是三十年的今日，扶輪社已佈滿整個世界，有幾千之多，而加入的社員，也以萬計了，發展不可謂不速。在中國，像北平，南京，漢口，廣州，上海等各大都市，而今也都有扶輪社的成立。</p>
<p>扶輪社的宗旨，一方在聯絡社員感情，一方在做些慈善事業。像上海的扶輪社，照例除每星期四集會一次外，在耶誕節一定要做些善事，最特別的就是徵集苦兒玩具。除了登報徵求破舊玩具之外，更公映影片，不收票資，祗收新舊玩具，每人一件。</p>
<p>目前時局雖非常混沌，但扶輪社此項工作，本年繼續進行。因爲他們看到在慈幼機關中，不知有多少兒童，他們終年不見玩具的面目，非常可憐。所以徵集破舊玩具，加以修理之後，在耶誕之前，分給貧苦兒童，當一份禮物，使他們可和別的兒童一樣，有玩具可玩。</p>
<p>十月廿六日，就是這一個星期日，上午十時半，扶輪社假南京大戲院公映徵集玩具新片。你要去看影片，不必花錢，祇要拿一件舊的玩具去。好在破舊玩具，放在家裹，又毫無用處，又可使苦兒得到玩具，原是一舉兩得，小朋友們何樂不爲呢！</p>
<p>扶輪社有着一個玩具醫院，僱有不少專家，修理玩具。所以徵集到了破舊玩具，經過玩具醫院修理過後，就像新的無異。每一個年頭，他們用種種方法，向各界徵集破舊玩具。修好之後，再在耶誕節分給全上海的苦難兒童，這也是一件值得贊助的慈幼工作吧？</p>
<h3 id="c74">我失學了 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>我是一個沒有恒心的人。不要說別的，就是讀書也沒恒心。父母給我付了學費，本來應該好好地讀書；但是我這脾氣壞極了，偏偏日夜吵著要學生意。終於在上星期六的一天退了學，投到一片製藥廠中去。在那裹，偌大的機器一天要我　十二小時，二天以後，我實在吃不消了，於是，又回到了家中；但是，我因此就失學了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們看了上面的一段事實，希望你們一心一意的讀書，不要像我這樣沒有恒心，辜負了父母的一番心血</p>
<h3 id="c75">再談最厲害的飛機 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>上一次，阿慰的哥哥只講了關於一架無聲飛機有趣的鎖聞，他因爲有一些事而中斷了他的話頭，於是阿慰隨時在找尋好機會，來要求他哥哥繼續的講下去，因爲他實在聽出滋味來了。居然在一天的下午，傍晚的時候，他哥哥正躺在沙發上在看報，他便抓住了這一個機會對他哥哥說：「哥哥，你上次不是答應我，如果有機會，再把最厲害的飛機講下去，今天的機會不是很好的嗎？你能不能再講下去嗎？我對於飛機是最喜歡聽的。」</p>
<p>「好，講下去，上次是講的無聲飛機，今天講的是一種可裝大砲的飛機，也可算是最厲害的飛機了。這種裝置大砲的飛機，　是由英國人發明的，到現在已經成功了。聽說這種飛機，每一小時能飛二百多英里，這速度是好算好的了，面目在飛行的時候，還可開砲攻擊，並能很準確的擊中目標，開砲的人可以安然的坐在飛機的艙裹，瞄準所要攻擊的目的，不論在什麼地位，砲彈一開出去，射中目標可以說是一定的了；因爲砲彈的開出去，不是用人工的，完全用一種自動的裝置，和裝甲兵艦上的砲座開砲的情形一模一樣。還有一種撒佈防空塵的飛　，這種飛機不是攻擊對方，而是防備對方飛機的濫炸城　，也是英國人發明的。據說這種防空塵是一種像烟務一般的金屬粉末，一聽得對方飛機來進　警報的時候，防空的飛機立刻升到空中去撒布防空塵，祇要幾架的飛機，在短時間內，便能夠把一個緊要城市的天空四周，密佈了一層看不見的防空塵，任何對方的飛機一入了這塵務中，金屬的　末便能破壞對方飛機上的發動機，它便不能再前進，而有墜下的可能。假使對方飛機已知道了防空塵的高度，而要飛到防空塵的上面去，如果對方是巨型的轟炸機的話，實是一個最困難的事，所以這是一種安全的防空的妙法，不過使用起來也不是一件容易的事情，因此至今也在報紙上還沒有看見利用這個方法來防空的。還有一種烟務噴射飛機，外形和軍用機一樣，不過在　中裝置一座噴射瀝青（俗叫柏油）烟霧的機器，在轟炸的時候，便不須飛到低處去擲彈，只要在空中把瀝青再加上毒藥和容易燃燒的藥品所製成的炸彈，投擲下去，那彈便在空中噴射烟霧後才落地，便可燒毀對方的　藥物，更可悶死兵士等，這種飛機是很可怕的了。最後有一種神秘飛機，是美國人發明，利用無綫電機來自動駕駛，所以在飛機裹不需要一個人，據說在太平洋上飛行了三小時，速度也很快，結果已算成功。在戰事中，只要把這種飛機滿載了炸彈，飛到對方去轟炸，如果遇到了意外的話，至多損失了一架飛機，而不須犧牲一兵一卒的生命了。這幾種都是最厲害的飛　。」</p>

<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>論譚富英的嗓音</p>
<p>每一伶人的嗓音，因環境關係，必有變化，（一）年齡的增進，由童子音變爲少壯時的音，再變爲蒼老；（二）用工的勤惰，不常用工，嗓音生澀，像鋼鐵牛銹；（三）身體的强弱，身强氣充，嗓音大而有力，衰弱有病態，則氣短音空，譚富英在富運成坐科時才十二三歲，他初出台唱戲，我就聽過，音是童子音，腔是科班的普通腔，人生得相貌不錯，比現在胖得多，很討人歡喜，後來倒了嗆，嗓音好久不出來，調門很低，唱着很費勁，因此改了低腔，對付嗓子，不免帶了一點鼻音，這樣子有很長的時期。後來他看着馬述良獨出鋒頭，這纔發憤用工，居然能把嗓音練得很寬，且又高又響，一躍和馬連良打個平手。道幾年譯馬二人，爲顧全同行同科的義氣，兩下相讓，不肯同時在上海兩個舞台上對壘，這是一種很好的辦法。上次富英在更新演唱，我聽了幾次，嗓倒寬亮，亦很爲賣力。此番他又在大舞台登塲，有聽過他唱的人說；嗓音比上次稍覺窄些，我聽這話，很爲罣心。富英唱摘纓會的這天，被我聽到了，這齣戲本是老戲，意思很好，但塲子稍冷，唱句不甚多，有許多人聽着不大過癮，我亦不去評論，今單論其嗓音，比其上次進退如何？富英去年在更新時，嗓音之寬，可稱無敵，但我細品其音，尙覺寬而不緊，有一證據，嘎調不起，乃是不能逼緊喉嚨的緣故，如今我聽他唱摘纓會的嗓音，比去年較爲充實緊勁，放大的地方，亦能嚮堂，照此看來，富英的嗓子，是有了進步，想必嘎調亦能上去了，這是一件喜事。其父小培應該說：「待我謝天謝地」其祖英秀，泉下有知，亦當含笑云：「有這嗓音，方不愧是譚門後代」了。我還有好心獻上，我勸富英，把唱工再追求。身體再保養，好讓我們聽着解解愁恨。</p>

<p>一件玩具換一票</p>
<p>整個世界雖充滿了恐怖，時間却過得那麼快，耶誕又離得不遠了。上海扶輪社，照例在耶誕之前，要公映幾次徵集玩具影片。把徵集到的玩具，於耶誕時節，分發給終年沒有看見玩具的苦兒。</p>
<p>此徵集玩具影片，本年繼續公映，第一次已定於今日（星期日）上午十時牛，假南京大戲院公映一塲。所映的影片，卡通·新聞·滑稽片等，無所不有。</p>
<p>想去看電影的人，不必破鈔，祇要帶一件玩具去，就可換到門券一紙。玩具的新舊，倒是不拘的，倘若沒有玩具，那當天在劇院門口，也有玩具出售的。</p>
<p>所有舊的玩具，　集到後，立卽送到扶輪社的玩具醫院去修理，務使耶誕時節，能够發給全市慈幼機關中的苦見，當做一份禮物。　扶輪社預定的目標，可徵集玩具一萬件。所以在南京竹第一次公映影片後，說不定還要在其地影院公映呢。</p>

<p>俺生的一副銅筋鐵肋，吳將軍不令俺在戰塲上痛痛快快的多殺幾個流寇，却反敎俺去做崑崙奴，代他盜出紅綃，俺老張雖是個粗莽武夫，計算起來，却不値得，不比在承平之世，俺受了吳將軍的豢養，代他幹一下子，也無不可。此刻俺却不願做私人的走狗」陳飛道：「吳將軍倘能決心和流寇厮殺，早應該起了人馬，殺上北京去，方是道理，那麼他的寵姬也能從流寇手裏救出來了。誰敎他退到道裏來，一仟　流寇猖獗的呢」？白十二見大家都不贊成三桂的請求，他知道張蒼虬等衆人性情豪邁，直爽，不論什麽事，據理直言，不諛所私的。旣然他們都如此說，這件事料來難有希望了，便說道：「小弟也不過轉逹吳將軍的意思，諸位若然不願前去，當然不敢勉强，我等且多喝數杯」。張蒼虬道：「要敎俺喝酒，俺必遵命。醉臥沙塲君莫笑，古來爭戰幾人回，倘然喝够了酒，出去厮殺一回，雖死亦甘。現在退守於此，實在沮喪士氣的，不敢贊同。」柳隱英微笑道：「小弟現知吳將軍的性情很多猶豫遲疑，缺少果決，要求他担當重大的責任，是很難的事，我前番所說的話不幸而中了。料他一顆心完全繫戀在寵姬身上，國事倒反在後面呢」。（二〇二）</p>

<p>Lanzhou: President Yu went to Qinghai today for inspection. A reporter visited President Yu upon his return from Hexi to inquire about his impressions of his trip to the west. He said that over the past four or five years, various aspects of Hexi have been improving daily through the adjustments made by the authorities and the hard work of local party and government personnel. The general public's efforts in complying with laws and regulations and assisting in road construction demonstrate their efforts in resisting the Japanese and building the nation, which is commendable. What he found most gratifying was the gradual development of local education, with teachers and students showing excellent spirit and full of new vitality. However, due to the vastness of the area, universal education is still needed. In addition, he discussed the abundance of surface and underground resources in Hexi. Just considering the fruits produced along the two thousand-mile route, the development of transportation in the future will be a major source of revenue for Hexi. When discussing the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, President Yu happily stated that this is "the ocean of art for various Eastern ethnic groups and a national treasure of our country." However, due to inadequate preservation, there is a risk of it being submerged. He said that he has decided to establish the Dunhuang Art Academy and appoint the famous painter Zhang Daqian, who is currently surveying the caves, to preside over it in order to preserve this precious legacy of the ancients.

<p>Chongqing: The National Savings Promotion Association attaches great importance to the effectiveness of the savings movement in reaching the general public. It has instructed provincial branches to send personnel to various counties to supervise the work of the branch associations. According to recent reports from along the Longhai Railway line, primary school teachers in many counties are utilizing gatherings to explain the benefits of saving to the public, which has been effective but still needs to be strengthened. The savings amount averages between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan per county, mostly in small amounts. Later, enthusiastic compatriots from the area also participated in savings. In a location near the front lines, the commander of the self-defense forces purchased 10,000 yuan in bonds, taking the lead in promoting savings, and the response was very enthusiastic. The Special Party Headquarters of the Xth War Zone launched a savings campaign for soldiers, coordinating with local post offices and military post offices to implement savings, which was particularly arduous. Despite the irregular geography along the Longhai Railway, it has gradually taken shape shortly after its establishment, which is commendable. The Association is currently compiling reports from various sources to conduct further research, with the aim of promoting even faster development. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>

The original membership fee was one yuan, but now it is hoped that the average will be two yuan per person. (Havas dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 24th: Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that the US government has protested to Germany over the sinking of the US ship "Robin Moor" by a German submarine in August of this year, but has not yet received a reply from the German government.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: The Department of Commerce's Foreign Commerce Weekly reports that Japanese trade with major overseas countries has been suspended, and there is a great shortage of raw materials. Industry and commerce are gradually losing normalcy. Ships between Japan and the United States, the British Empire, and the Dutch East Indies have almost all been suspended. These locations account for 75% of Japan's foreign trade, and have traditionally supplied Japan with steel, lead, zinc, aluminum, copper, tin, cotton, gasoline, machinery, and other goods. Now, Japan can only rely on the Japanese-held group region. However, it is almost impossible for Japan to achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials in this region in the short term. Therefore, Japan is now making every effort to conserve raw materials. All hardware items, even broken spades, boilers, sewer covers, etc., are being collected as much as possible. It goes without saying that gasoline retailers are closing down one after another, and there is a growing shortage of food for the people. The future of the Japanese silk industry is very uncertain, and the import and export of cotton goods have almost ceased. Raw cotton from South America is difficult to transport due to limited shipping, and the amount of cotton produced in the occupied areas of China is not as high as expected.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japan Will Not Abandon Expansion Plans; Although a Far East Conflict is Avoidable <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>US Naval Chief Declares the Current Situation Extremely Tense; Assisting Britain and the Soviet Union is the Most Important Task at Present</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: US Navy Secretary Knox stated yesterday to several naval munitions manufacturers that if Japan does not abandon its expansion plans, a Far East conflict is inevitable. The situation in the Far East is currently extremely tense. We know that the Japanese have no intention of abandoning their expansion plans. If they continue down this path, conflict is unavoidable. Knox made these remarks while discussing how to transport munitions to assist the Soviet Union. Knox had rushed back from another meeting. He did not say with whom he was meeting, but said that everyone present agreed that supplying Britain and the Soviet Union with war materials was extremely important. Knox urged the munitions manufacturers not to miss any opportunity to produce quickly, and said that maintaining the Soviet army in the war is one of the most important events we should do in this decisive battle. There are three ways to transport supplies into the Soviet Union: Arkhangelsk, Vladivostok, and around Africa and into Persia. Of these three routes, Arkhangelsk is the best, but it is located in the far north and has many difficulties. Icebreakers must be used to keep the port open. Ships traveling on this route cannot be expected to be fast, and are vulnerable to German bomber attacks. Furthermore, Arkhangelsk does not have sufficient transportation facilities. At the same time, the situation in the Far East makes the continued use of the Vladivostok route a problem. This route is just as undesirable as Arkhangelsk. The third route requires a 12,000-mile voyage, and inland transportation will also be very difficult, such as building railways through Persia, etc.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th: Colonel Knox, the Navy Secretary, convened several dozen ammunition manufacturers and shipping industry representatives today to discuss the issue of the United States supplying the Soviet Union with arms. He also gave a speech during the meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: The Sea and Land Army Weekly published an article written by Navy Secretary Knox on the Navy Memorial Day, stating, "The East is like a large powder keg that can explode at any time. The sound of its explosion will be heard overseas. Democratic countries are now praying that the Soviet Union can maintain its military strength. The Axis armies not only threaten East Africa and the African coast across the Atlantic from the Americas, but India and Singapore will also be the next targets of the Axis powers. US warships are now patrolling the US seas and are instructed to sink Axis ships upon sight."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th: Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, wrote in the current issue of Sea and Land Army Weekly, "The Navy should prepare to deal with any current power or combined powers, regardless of whether the threat comes from the Pacific or the Atlantic."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: The local newspapers unanimously commented on the statement by US Navy Secretary Knox that a conflict is possible in the Far East, saying that it can be seen as an indication that the US government is ending its policy of appeasement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: Senator Pepper told reporters today that the United States should immediately blockade Japan to cut off the supply of all military supplies to Japan. He agreed with Navy Secretary Knox's statement that the situation in the Pacific is extremely tense, and said that we should take action before Japan launches a pincer attack on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press, Santiago, Chile, 25th: "La Prensa" yesterday advised the Chilean government to take necessary measures as the US-Japanese Pacific war approaches. The newspaper outlined the political, military, and economic crisis of such a war, stating that the crises that will inevitably be encountered are the occupation of Easter Island and the various Chilean overseas islands. It also said that the recently annexed Antarctic territories will be suitable for supplying raiding ships and submarines. In addition, Japan will be able to cut off Chile's supply to the United States.</p>
<p>Japan Issues Official Announcement Expressing Dissatisfaction with US Naval Chief's Speech</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th: The Cabinet Information Bureau issued an official brief announcement today, saying that US Navy Secretary Knox's speech yesterday was unfortunate because US-Japanese negotiations are underway, and Knox's speech is far from the spirit of these negotiations. Japanese observers said that the meaning of Knox's speech to munitions manufacturers is not surprising in light of his past views, and that it is clearly intended to stir up war sentiment at home when the situation in Europe is unfavorable to Britain, rather than to intimidate Japan. They said that Knox's pro-war remarks seem strange because recent news from Washington said that the government has banned non-diplomatic officials from making hostile remarks against Japan. Japanese evening newspapers all prominently published Knox's speech, with headlines mostly accusing him of insulting Japan.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th: The Japan Times and Mail, known as the mouthpiece of the Foreign Ministry, argued strongly today that the United States should try to be friendly with Japan and not cause Japan to join the Axis powers to strengthen the already powerful striking force of the Axis. If the United States believes that Nazi Germany is its enemy, then why must the United States force Japan to join the war to aid the enemies of the United States? The United States should make all reasonable concessions to keep Japan neutral in order to assist Britain and the Soviet Union. If the United States continues to aid Chongqing, there is also a risk of forcing Japan to join the war, and this move will only make it necessary to greatly increase the production of American military equipment. If the United States stops material assistance to China, it can save a lot of military supplies that will need to be used to deal with Japan. Japan has sufficient naval and military forces to exclude the Allied trade from the Pacific and even the Indian Ocean. This factor is very important in the balance of power in the wartime world. According to the newspaper, the British government should have made some adjustments with Japan months ago. The solution should be decided by Britain. Britain has made all the wars and suffered all the losses on behalf of the United States, and should know better than Washington what it means to add an enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Tokyo Officials Claim Yesterday: Nomura Temporarily Will Not Return to Japan; Wakasugi and Welles Continue Talks <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th: Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister to the US and advisor to Ambassador Nomura, met with Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday, apparently continuing the exploratory talks between the US and Japan. Afterwards, Wakasugi declined to comment on whether the Japanese Embassy had received new instructions from Tokyo. It has now been learned that, unless the situation in the Pacific becomes too tense to leave his post, Nomura will return to Tokyo soon to confer with Tojo's new cabinet. If Nomura cannot be spared, Counselor Iguchi of the embassy may go to Tokyo instead. Kojima, Nomura's special advisor, will depart for Japan tomorrow. It is widely known that Nomura is deeply aware of American public opinion regarding Japan and its future actions in the Far East, and clearly believes that if the United States goes to war with Japan, it will undoubtedly have the support of the people. American public opinion also believes that the United States will win without much effort. It is believed that Nomura wants to inform his government of this view, as he believes that all issues between the two countries can be resolved through diplomacy. What he fears is that the question of Japan's circumstances may render diplomacy ineffective.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th: According to a special dispatch from the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun in Washington, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura may personally return to his country to report to Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo, or send an embassy counselor back to report. Officials here say that this news is speculative rumor and is unlikely to materialize at present.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: Last night, a semi-official Japanese source stated that reports of American sentiment gradually advocating inviting Japanese representatives to Washington to adjust relations between the two countries have aroused great interest. There is no inherent animosity between Japan and the United States. The Japanese government and the current government have stated their peaceful intentions, as far as possible to achieve their goals in East Asia. Therefore, the result of the US-Japan talks depends entirely on the sincerity of the United States. By "sincerity" is meant a correct understanding of the limits of Japan in the US-Japan talks. The United States should now seize the current opportunity and adopt the views expressed by the new Japanese Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th: Government leaders are pessimistic about the current US-Japan negotiations. In recent days, government authorities have repeatedly warned political commentators who believe that the United States will adopt a policy of appeasement in the Pacific not to jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>American Sentiment Opposes Any Appeasement Actions</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: The announcement issued by the Maritime Commission, stating that materials being shipped to the Soviet Union would depart from Boston, was obviously drafted hastily and without consideration. In fact, this statement should be interpreted as meaning that all goods passing through the Atlantic Ocean will depart from Boston, not that all aid to the Soviet Union will depart from this route. The facts may be stated plainly and simply: aid to the Soviet Union will still pass through Vladivostok, but goods departing from the American East Coast will be shipped to Archangel. This is because goods produced in the American states must be transported by rail over a long distance to San Francisco, and then transported by rail for five thousand miles from Vladivostok to the Soviet front. Therefore, it is easier to transport goods produced in the eastern states to Archangel. After reaching Archangel, it is only a few hundred miles to the Soviet positions. It is reported that Moscow has requested that some supplies be shipped in via Archangel. A critic here, Mr. Krabb, stated that the State Department and the President's Office were greatly surprised by this announcement from the Maritime Commission, and the New York Times even quoted Crocker as saying that not only were the British and Soviet embassies shocked by this announcement, but the Maritime Commission itself felt uneasy about the announcement as reported in the newspapers. Tokyo was delighted by this appeasement action by the United States, but this self-congratulation is premature, as the United States has no intention of appeasing Japan in this plan. It is said that because the Unified Committee released this news, it directly supplied useful information to the German Navy, so there is much criticism of the committee. The Washington Post published an editorial stating that American public opinion firmly opposes any action containing a hint of appeasement toward Japan, or any concession under Japanese threat. The significance of this announcement by the Maritime Commission is that the US authorities believe that Moscow will not fall into German hands in the short term, so some supplies are being shipped to the Soviet front lines via Archangel.</p>
<p>Japanese Political Commentators Advocate Convening an Axis Conference</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 25th: Shimizu, a political commentator for the Hochi Shimbun, called in the morning newspaper for the Japanese government to find a way to hold a conference with Germany and Italy. He said that this conference is more important than the Japanese-American negotiations. Japanese diplomacy is based on the Tripartite Pact and cannot allow the Japanese-American negotiations to violate the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. He also said that if Japan does not know whether Germany wants to completely defeat the Soviet Union, or intends to cease fire soon and retain the conquered territory, then Japan cannot decide its policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>French Leaders Discuss Curbing Assassinations; Parisian Public Outraged by Execution of Hostages</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 24th: It is widely rumored that Marshal Petain plans to go to the occupied zone in person to act as a "hostage" in order to prevent the German military authorities from massacring hostages indiscriminately. However, when asked of people close to Marshal Petain, they all refused to make any statement.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 25th: Internal Affairs Minister Pucheu attended a cabinet meeting today. After hearing that the German authorities had postponed the execution of one hundred French hostages, he set off for Paris. At the same time, the mayor of Bordeaux asked the residents of the city to cooperate with the authorities in apprehending the murderer in the assassination of a German officer.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 25th: According to what was announced here yesterday, the issues discussed by Petain and Interior Minister Pucheu were the attacks by French people on German soldiers in Nantes and Bordeaux. Political circles here believe that the government will take strict measures to curb such illegal activities.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: According to news from the French border, the Parisian public is deeply angered by the execution of hostages. Lists of those executed, which were recently posted in prominent locations in Paris, have been torn down, so the reposted lists are now guarded by police to prevent them from being torn down again. On October 17th, eight members of the French Academy were arrested, and about 300 university professors and other educators were also detained for refusing to sign a declaration supporting the new order. The arrest of these people has made a great impression on the French people. At the same time, all Jews in France continue to be arrested, regardless of their nationality. There are now almost no Jewish residents in Paris. It is reported that the Spanish representative is quite displeased that Spanish Jews are also among those arrested, and has reportedly stated that Spain has no racial issues.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 25th: The British Admiralty announced that the British destroyer HMS Broadwater was sunk by a torpedo while on escort duty in the North Atlantic. The crew's relatives have been notified. The HMS Broadwater had shelled an enemy submarine the day before it was sunk, possibly sinking it. This is the second of the fifty destroyers transferred by the United States to Britain to be sunk. Among the officers killed on board was Major Parker of Boston, USA, who belonged to the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. It is believed that Parker is the first American to die while serving in the British Navy. The first destroyer transferred by the United States to Britain to be sunk was the HMS Bath, manned by the Norwegian Navy. The now-sunk HMS Broadwater, formerly the USS Mason, was built by the Bath Iron Works near Boston.</p>

<p>United Press, New York, 25th: This morning, five US Army aircraft and three civilian aircraft went missing. Earlier, two Army aircraft crashed, killing five crew members in one of them. A Flying Fortress landed in Charleston, where it caught fire. Three of the nine crew members parachuted out on the pilot's orders, while the other six remained in the plane. The fire was extinguished. A squadron of nineteen single-seat P-40 fighter planes was scattered by a storm in the mountains of Central California. It is reported that only fourteen have landed safely. One crashed after the pilot bailed out, and four others are missing. A US Army bomber, reportedly piloted by a colonel, has been missing since leaving Yuma last Tuesday. On Friday, an R-18 bomber crashed on Mount Home in California, killing five Army pilots.

<p>Reuters, Sydney, 25th: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced that Duff Cooper will arrive in Australia on November 5th and stay for two weeks, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, and other places before going to New Zealand. It is expected that Duff Cooper will discuss with the Australian government the measures to be taken to defend the Pacific, and may be invited to attend meetings of the War Cabinet and the War Advisory Council.

<h3 id="e25">On US-Japan Relations Again <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>After the decision to change the shipping route of a portion of American aid to the Soviet Union, Japan became complacent, insisting that this was an American concession to Japan and boasting of a diplomatic victory. However, according to an explanation from Washington yesterday, this was fundamentally just a technical measure to adapt to needs, because shipping to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok takes ten days, while taking the route via Archangel only takes forty-eight hours. At a time when the Red Army is waiting urgently for supplies, the United States, disregarding the threat of destruction that Germany could launch in the Arctic Ocean, resolutely decided to take a more difficult but actually shorter route. This seems to be enough to show the United States' active and courageous support for the Soviet Union. How can it be misinterpreted as appeasement of Japan? The only thing that can be criticized is that even if the Maritime Commission had such a decision, it was not necessary to publicly announce it, which was criticized as "supplying useful information to German raiders." No wonder that after this announcement was made, the State Department, the White House, and the British and Soviet embassies all felt surprised.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the main significance of Tojo's cabinet is only to create a situation that is convenient for action at any time. In the past, only because Japan's national strength had been consumed by more than half due to the war against China, and because the anti-aggression front in the Far East was already quite strong, it did not dare to rashly engage in actions that were too large-scale or too risky without a "suitable opportunity." If this opportunity suddenly appears, then it is believed that even if the United States appeases, it is feared that it will not be able to restrain Japan. "Small favors" like changing the route of aid to the Soviet Union, especially, cannot be said to be able to stop Japan. Moreover, to take a step back, even if we assume that this decision by the US Maritime Commission is not unrelated to the ongoing US-Japan talks, the fact is that these talks show no signs of completion. Therefore, even if the US government intends to appease Japan, there is no need to meet the Japanese demands ahead of time before the talks are over, because if our memory is correct, it seems that the basic principle of this US-Japan talk is to exchange economic concessions for Japan's abandonment of aggression. Now, Japan has not only not provided any guarantees, but has instead emerged with a more radical cabinet than before. Under these circumstances, the United States has even less reason to be two-faced and devalue itself.</p>
<p>Some say that the United States, firstly, seeing that the Soviet front-line battles are quite serious, and secondly, that the Nazi threat in the Atlantic is becoming increasingly imminent, has no choice but to temporarily appease Japan to avoid the danger of fighting on two fronts. This statement seems reasonable on the surface, but if we analyze it further, it is still a specious argument. First, it is true that the situation in Moscow has been very critical in the past few days, but seeing that the Red Army's resistance is still strong, and that the relocation of the capital and the gathering of reinforcements are still in good order, it is believable that even if Moscow falls, Stalin will not abandon the war and make peace, as France did. In addition, winter is approaching in a blink of an eye, and even if the Nazis capture the Red Capital, their future offensive, in the icy and snowy environment, will probably require a considerable period of replenishment and preparation, and it will be difficult to continue their efforts. Second, although the threat in the Atlantic is great, Britain's strength is strong and complete, and it can certainly still be used. The reason why it has always been unwilling to rashly open a second battlefield in Western Europe is believed to be its fundamental intention, which is to focus on this. Therefore, as far as the United States is concerned, the current problem is only how to arm merchant ships, how to implement escorts, and how to fully supply Britain and the Soviet Union with all necessary military and material resources, so that on the one hand, the Red Army can continue to resist, and on the other hand, Britain can be prepared to meet the Nazi onslaught with a strong and effective posture in case of a westward turn. Therefore, before Britain shows signs of collapse, the United States cannot fundamentally talk about joining the European war. Although the repeated attacks on American ships by German submarines are undoubtedly intended to provoke the United States and force it to declare war early, so as to give Japan an opportunity to act, it can be seen from the consistent prudence of the Washington government that it has long seen through its tricks and will not act rashly and fall into the Nazi plot to induce the United States to fight on two fronts. From this point of view, as long as Britain and the Soviet Union are strong enough to hold back the Axis powers, even if the United States' preparations for joining the European war are completed, and even if the opportunity to join the war is ripe, it is still better to join as late as possible. The reason is that before the United States joins the European war, it must first eliminate its worries in the Pacific, which will not be achieved by a policy of appeasement, because temporary appeasement is tantamount to giving the other party an opportunity to attack. This common sense, it is believed that President Roosevelt, who has always had the deepest understanding of the aggression front, will be able to understand thoroughly.</p>
<p>In summary, we dare to assert that the United States has no intention of appeasing Japan, because not only is there no such need, but it also clearly knows that it is useless. If we extend this further, we might as well assert that the United States will not participate in the European war, but if it does participate, it will first eliminate the hidden dangers in the Far East, and it will not eliminate them by means of appeasement, because such appeasement is tantamount to digging its own grave, which is not something a country preparing to go to war would be happy to do. Before this situation occurs, it can only indirectly rely on the strength of others to consume the strength that constitutes this hidden danger. In other words, it can only assist China in attacking Japan, just as it assists Britain and the Soviet Union in attacking Germany. Regarding this, the remarks made by US Navy Secretary Knox the day before yesterday that "a US-Japan conflict is ultimately inevitable" seem to be a powerful proof.</p>
<h3 id="e26">De Zeng Deploys Reinforcements, Determined to Seize Soviet Capital in Decisive Battle <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Side Reaffirms Determination to Fight a Protracted War, German Side Announces Capture of Kharkov City</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch - Moscow Radio reports, according to the latest war report received by the "Pravda" at 3:00 AM this morning, that the Germans are now preparing for a decisive battle to seize Moscow. Fierce fighting took place on the front lines all day yesterday, but there were essentially no changes. German troops appear to be increasing reinforcements. At dawn yesterday, artillery fire began to roar. German tanks and infantry launched continuous attacks throughout the day without respite. South of Maloyaroslavets, German forces forced the Soviets to retreat at two points, but their continued advance was halted, and attempts to cross the Oka River also failed. Soviet forces in the northern sector of the Moscow front are still holding their original positions. The fighting west of Moscow near Mozhaisk is particularly fierce, with German forces attempting to develop offensives in both the northeast directions. Soviet forces are making every effort to defend every village. Soviet air force is now bombing the highways used by German reinforcements. In one area, they destroyed 70 German tanks and armored vehicles, 200 trucks, two infantry regiments, and two anti-aircraft artillery teams. The report concludes by stating that the German offensive on Moscow has now lasted 23 days, which shows that Hitler's plan to seize the city with a blitzkrieg has failed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 25th, German Headquarters Dispatch - Today's German military report states that German forces captured Kharkov yesterday, an important center of Soviet military industry and industry. Yesterday, Belgorod, a key transportation hub 75 kilometers west of Kharkov, was also captured.</p>
<p>International News Agency, 25th, Kuibyshev Dispatch - Soviet official spokesman Lozovsky announced here at the temporary Soviet capital yesterday for the first time to news reporters that the Soviets will fight for several years and that a new Second Red Army is being formed. "How long the German forces can maintain is still uncertain. They will soon be convinced that the Soviet reserves have not been exhausted." Marshal Timoshenko has been relieved of his command of the Central Front and has now succeeded Marshal Budyonny as commander of the Southern Front. (London sources speculate that Marshal Budyonny may have been ordered to command another independent Red Army, so that he can jointly defend the Caucasus with the British forces when the German forces break through the Southern Front.) The Red Star newspaper stated that the situation on the Southern Front is critical everywhere, "The enemy is trying to advance in order to occupy the most fertile areas of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 24th, Moscow Dispatch - The Moscow Garrison Command broadcast a message this morning stating that the vanguard of the German forces has reached a certain stronghold, only 14 miles away from Moscow.</p>
<p>Reuters, 25th, London Dispatch - The latest Soviet communique announced that it had stopped the German advance southwest of Moscow, but the situation on the Southern Front remains serious. The weather conditions on the front lines are currently hindering military operations. A Berlin spokesman stated that German forces are currently struggling through mud. The German military also expects that decisive battles cannot be engaged in until the ground freezes solid. A German official news agency quoted military commentators as saying that victories unrelated to the overall situation do not require constant reports. German forces have won ten major battles, which can bring the current war to an end, and victory will ultimately belong to Germany. At the same time, German front-line correspondents sent dispatches lamenting the difficult situation, stating that German forces are 100 miles away from Moscow, with Soviet troops gathered in between, and there are also battles on both sides of the road where German forces are advancing. Soviet artillery and aircraft are further increasing the difficulties for German forces. Moscow sources reported that the German side has deployed more fresh troops, including Finnish troops transferred to the Leningrad front and Romanian troops transferred to the southern front to assist in the battle. Several German regiments have suffered losses of six or seven tenths. The Soviet Red Star newspaper stated that the situation on the Southern Front remains serious, and the enemy forces are trying to occupy the most important industrial center, so they have stepped up their attacks on Rostov-on-Don, and the positions near the cities of Stalino and Makeevka in the Don River basin have repeatedly changed hands. Berlin claimed that one Soviet force had retreated behind the Donets River. At the same time, there are also fierce battles in Crimea. Moscow said that the enemy forces in Perekop have invaded the Soviet defense line, forming a wedge. The German side also reported that Soviet forces are currently attacking across the Neva River near Leningrad. The latest Soviet communique stated, "On October 24, our forces engaged the enemy in the Taganrog and Makeevka areas. In the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas, the German fascist forces fiercely attacked our positions, suffering heavy blows and retreating. The enemy forces suffered heavy losses. On October 23, 10 German aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviet forces also lost 6 aircraft. On October 24, 17 enemy aircraft were shot down near Moscow." The Moscow Air Defense Command announced that the German side has lost 305 aircraft in air battles near Moscow, of which 100 were shot down in the past few days.</p>
<p>Germany Launches Offensive in the Northern Sector, Encounters Fierce Soviet Resistance, No Progress Made</p>
<p>Reuters, 25th, Moscow Dispatch - The Red Star newspaper dispatch stated that the war situation in the Donets Basin on the southern front remains serious. The enemy forces' plan to occupy the extremely important industrial center by a pincer attack has failed. After a short period of silence, the German forces resumed their attacks but were still repelled. However, in one area, the Soviet forces withdrew to new positions. The German forces in that area suffered heavy losses and have been forced to adopt a defensive posture. A Pravda war dispatch describing the activities on the northern front stated that after the German forces invaded the Kalinin region, they attempted to launch an offensive in the northwest, especially near Lake Ilmen. Fierce fighting has occurred in the past few days, but the enemy forces have now been driven back to their original positions, suffering considerable losses. In this battle, one German battalion, formed into a column one kilometer long, was heavily bombarded by strong Soviet artillery fire and mostly annihilated. In another area, after paying a heavy price, the enemy forces made a wedge-shaped breakthrough into the Soviet positions. The Soviet forces quickly launched a series of fierce counterattacks, and the German forces were unable to withstand it and fled in disarray, and the houses in the village of Kolmi, which they had occupied, were burned down by fire. The German forces in Novgorod, which had been inactive for a long time, recently attempted to cross the Pola River under the cover of morning fog, but were repelled by the Soviet forces' fierce artillery fire. In the three days of fierce fighting in the Lake Ilmen area, it is estimated that the German forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties and were not only unable to gain an inch but were also forced to withdraw from the village of Beli. Regarding the war situation on the Moscow front, the Soviet official news agency reported that extremely fierce fighting is continuing. The German forces are paying a heavy price in casualties, making slight intrusions into the Soviet positions, especially around Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. German forces are currently desperately trying to break through the Soviet defenses. In one area, German forces have also deployed Romanian and Finnish troops to assist in the battle. At a certain point that was previously broken through by the German forces, the Soviet forces have launched a counterattack and recaptured it. On the night of the 22nd, the enemy forces launched another attack, and Soviet artillery fire prevented the advance of the German infantry and tanks. The road leading to the Soviet fortifications was covered with German corpses.</p>
<p>TASS News Agency, 25th, Central Front Battlefield Report Dispatch - Today, the enemy's offensive at all points on the central front was repelled. The Red Army led by Rokossovsky achieved particularly outstanding results. On the 24th alone, the team destroyed 80 enemy tanks and 200 military vehicles, while also annihilating two enemy infantry battalions. Fierce fighting is still continuing.</p>
<p>Landmine Explosion in Odessa City, Two Romanian Generals Killed</p>
<p>Reuters, 25th, Vichy Dispatch - A dispatch from Bucharest states that Odessa was bombed, and the Romanian commander of the fortress occupying the city, General Glugojanu, and 50 officers and soldiers were killed in the bombing. In addition, a certain building recently occupied by the Soviet secret police was occupied by the Romanian forces. When they turned the faucet to get water, they triggered a detonating cord, causing a huge bomb to explode, killing many Romanian soldiers. Lieutenant General Avirell, who was appointed as an administrative official in the city to carry out relief work, also died unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Depression of the French People <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The main purpose of my article is not to explain why France collapsed, or to blame anyone, any group, or any system of thought. This matter has already been done by people more qualified than me. I have no ambition to add my personal opinions to the views of those who were in France at the time and personally experienced the unprecedented changes of May and June 1940.</p>
<p>Moreover, although I am a Frenchman, I was still abroad, in the United States, when this change occurred. My views are inevitably influenced by my environment.</p>
<p>But I can't help but think. In fact, like many of my comrades, for months, I have wanted to reach some kind of conclusion and, with extreme caution, seek to solve the problems caused by the failure of France, not only the problems for the French people, but also the problems caused for those who do not want to give up free judgment like the Americans. Of course, I know that I am in the United States and have the freedom of thought, speech, and writing, and I have gained great benefits. But I also know that no matter what my thoughts are, according to my current comrades in France, they are of no use, simply because I can enjoy the most proud freedom, while they have lost this freedom.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion I have reached is of no other value than the personal opinion of someone who happened to be a Frenchman and whose father cannot know whether his thoughts and feelings are the same as those of someone living in a disintegrating France.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the basic factors of the current situation in France are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The first mistake of the Bordeaux government in requesting an armistice was to assume that France had been defeated and that Britain could no longer support itself for more than a few weeks.</p>
<p>(2) One wrong move led to many irreparable difficulties, resulting in the Vichy government's baffling policies and unsolvable psychological conflicts. On the one hand, there was hope for Britain's victory and rebirth, but it was still considered too incredible. On the other hand, there was a belief that the defeated could only join hands with the victors to have a realistic faction that could save the situation.</p>
<p>(3) The public's hatred of the Germans is actually increasing.</p>
<p>(4) France's position has permanent fluidity. Although the French want to find their own solutions, in reality, this war has included the whole world and is expanding day by day. It is impossible to imagine the future during this period.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, during the Bordeaux Conference, the French firmly believed that Britain would not be able to sustain itself for many weeks after the French army was defeated. Finally, it was decided that France should request an armistice from Germany. After a long debate, it was also decided that the government should remain in France. I have not heard any Frenchman disagree with this fact. The process of how to persuade President Lebrun to abandon the plan to go to the Philippines can be seen in the official report of the Vichy government. General Weygand seems to have first suggested an armistice after the failure of the resistance on the Somme River. Marshal Pétain and many others quickly echoed this suggestion.</p>
<p>The following fact is enough to prove that people generally believed that Britain could not resist the German attack alone.</p>
<p>When the French armistice delegation was discussing the terms of the armistice in Compiègne, the clause that France would no longer support Britain was also under discussion. One of the French delegates said, "In view of the fact that Britain will soon withdraw from the war, is this clause not superfluous?" General Keitel of Germany replied that he certainly hoped that what his French friend said was correct, but the German army could not take such chances.</p>
<p>If the French leaders at that time could have foreseen the success of British resistance, they could have taken many other routes. It is useless to speculate now. Poland's situation was far worse than France's, but it was still able to resist to the end. After the defeat of France, Britain's position was precarious. In the eyes of Nazi realists, it seemed almost hopeless, but Churchill, regardless of the failure of his allies, decided to continue the war. However, the French generals and most political leaders were convinced that the defeat of France was the end of the war. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Gold Prices Rise for Eight Consecutive Days, Increase by More Than 8,300 Yuan, Newly Established Banks Only Know How to Collect Gold <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market prices saw an increase of 200 yuan for the October futures contract compared to the previous day. However, with only 40 taels traded that day, the price remained unchanged at 8,800 yuan. The cash market, on the other hand, was still in a state of turmoil, fluctuating outside the 18,000 yuan mark. Sales came from the Tianjin and Chaozhou syndicates and gold shops, while the newly established large and small speculative banks, each with a professional name in name only but essentially the same, absorbed huge amounts of capital, which they had no use for, and then used to absorb the remaining gold, colluding with large hoarders, competing to buy in. With this two-pronged approach, the gold market suddenly felt like a tiger with soaring momentum, and prices moved forward with a high head. It once rose from 17,100 yuan to 18,500 yuan, and soon turned to hover, but still closed up 950 yuan, with 4,500 taels traded in half a day.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the Central Bank and HSBC both had flat listings. The HSBC small counter price was stagnant. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still stable. There were still many importers of non-essential goods seeking to settle, and there may have been small amounts of supply and sale positions at three yuan. The British exchange rate was still two pence and there was still no transaction, and it finally closed flat with the previous day's closing price. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, British and American gold pounds rose sharply by 20 yuan along with the cash price. The British gold ticket was as stable as ever, and the market price stood flat. The American gold ticket rebounded to 34 yuan and 3 jiao, a rebound of 5 jiao from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong tickets was strong, and the market price rose by 1 jiao. The Japanese gold ticket was slightly firmer, and the evening market was as high as 3 yuan and 4 jiao.

<h3 id="e30">The Yarn Market Frequently Rises, Not Without Vigilance, The Situation is Gradually Losing its Former Stability <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market situation is still fluctuating and unstable, the trend is slightly quieter, this is because of the continuous sharp rise, so that new buyers are all vigilant, and at the same time, the cash market situation, which has been running wildly every day, has also turned peaceful, some bulls have spat out, and the market has returned to looseness. The 20-count Double Horse factory order had already turned weak in the afternoon of the previous day, and yesterday the opening price was 2,410 yuan, and it immediately fell to the limit, but the sellers outside the market were not extinct, and gradually loosened to 2,385 yuan. Later, when I heard that the cash had rebounded, the people's hearts were lifted, and the meeting plate was raised to 2,440 yuan. The current yarn transaction is still rare, but many parties still come to pull up the price, and most of the current yarn in the hands of the industry is covered in the futures market, ready to untie the lock, and cannot be sold. As for the exchange's yarn cloth for this month, it is the last day, and the squeeze is fierce. I wonder if it can be loosened a little next Monday. Shenxin Maru Factory opened 1,550 bales of 20-count Double Horse on the previous day, and the price was 2,500 yuan, which was accepted by the industry.</p>
<p>The gold-transformed horse futures are stable and see fatigue, fatigue and then rise, the foothold seems to be still strong. The morning opening factory order first fell to the limit, and various gangs spread rumors, and for a time people's hearts were uneasy, and there were many scattered bulls coming out. The period yarn opened in the afternoon above had fallen to the limit, so it was not affected. The November opening was 2,350 yuan, once leaked to a low price of 2,275 yuan, and then returned to high. The December opening was 2,350 yuan, seeing an increase of 12 yuan. The January period opened at 2,400 yuan, and after entering, it rose and fell like a rabbit, and the trend was firm. The trend is that the rise and fall are too fast, and both parties cannot buy and sell calmly, so this kind of trend is difficult to trade under general monopoly. Although there are still blind ins and outs, it is also difficult to avoid escaping from the battlefield, and dare not hold it for a long time. If it is hit, its return wind will also be terrible, and those engaged in it must be more cautious. The list is after,</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is slightly flat, and transactions are not prosperous, because its price is slightly loose, and manufacturers are also unwilling to do more, so the daily industry ball transactions are large, and yesterday, because of the relationship of Saturday, most people are watching, that is, the ball transactions also suddenly feel lonely.</p>

The 10-pound Three Rabbit coarse cloth closed at noon at 70 yuan, and the afternoon opening was 70 yuan and 5 jiao, and the rest of the coarse and fine cloth twill rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan, with mutual differences, and the market transaction was slightly quiet, because it was a return after the fall, and people's hearts were not stable, and it was worth the risk of two nights, and it was estimated that the street transaction was more than 500 pieces, and the customer sales to the northern gang and eastern Zhejiang totaled more than 200 pieces.</p>
<p>The eastern cloth was first tired and then rose, and the situation was still high. The exchange's period cloth for this month continued to rise by 1 yuan, and the closing price was 79 yuan. The January period rose by 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 9 fen to the highest plate. The spot market transaction was very busy, and the cloths were uniformly firmly rising. The Longtou fine cloth factory order, the noon closing price, was 85 yuan and 2 jiao, a gain of 1 yuan and a half per piece.

The No. 1 Saigon high goods were also only 170 yuan, and the ordinary goods were 1678 yuan. Later, because the price was low, it caused large households to absorb again, and the ball tracked actively, and the market shape was still tight, and the silver vault small dumplings suddenly returned to 153 yuan, and the foreign vault was 152 yuan, and the No. 2 Saigon high goods recovered to 1712 yuan. How could the large households have come out again in groups, and because it was a holiday on Sunday, it was estimated that the closing dumplings market would return to 1489 yuan, a step increase of about 23 yuan compared to the previous morning closing price, but the rice weevils would not be silent and rest, and in the afternoon, they would again fabricate that the municipal bureau of works' rice continued to be 5,000 tons of unsold said, in order to stir up people's hearts, and the buying atmosphere was revived.

<p>Yesterday's foreign vermicelli morning market was flat, and Jinlong opened at 43 yuan and 12 jiao, but it was soon absorbed by speculators taking advantage of the small hoarding, and the northern gang was even more active because of the cheap exchange rate. Although the daily flat powder is inevitable, it is said that the flat powder is only for the consumption of the small dumplings at a flat price, and the re-export still needs to be given to the commercial goods, so the buying atmosphere is suddenly strong, and Jinlong's spleen arrived in the afternoon at 44 yuan 56 jiao, and Yantai in the morning was 45 yuan 45 jiao, and the afternoon rose to 46 yuan, and also increased by 1 yuan and 35 jiao from the previous night, and the transaction was also more than 70,000 bags.

<h3 id="e40">American Economic Expert Kirkland Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing Shanghai's Legal Tender as the Main Task, Practical Study of Foreign Exchange Management</p>
<p>According to reliable sources obtained yesterday, since the arrival of British and American economic experts Nie Mayer and Kirkland in China, they have held several meetings with Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Chongqing on China's wartime economic problems. It is said that important decisions have been made, one of which is to stabilize Shanghai's legal tender. However, before the new measures are implemented, the opinions of the financial communities in Hong Kong and Shanghai will be sought for consideration. Mr. Kirkland's arrival in Shanghai is for this purpose.</p>
<p>Two Weeks' Stay Planned in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkland arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:20 pm from Hong Kong on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Ming Sheng ship and landed at the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart, personally went to the wharf to greet him. Upon arrival in Shanghai, Mr. Kirkland remained tight-lipped and politely declined to answer questions from visiting reporters. It is understood that Mr. Kirkland will discuss the issue of stabilizing Shanghai's legal tender with the Shanghai banking community in his capacity as an economic expert from the Exchange Equalization Fund, and will also investigate the management of foreign exchange in Shanghai by the Exchange Equalization Fund. At the same time, he will listen to reports from the Shanghai business community to understand the consequences of the U.S. implementation of the freezing order. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two weeks before returning to Hong Kong to report. It is also reported that the Exchange Equalization Fund and British and American economic experts will convene an important meeting in Hong Kong next month to discuss the management of foreign exchange. Mr. Nie Mayer is currently in Chongqing and will soon go to Hong Kong to attend. It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kirkland will rush to participate. However, the rumor that the Chinese government will abandon the Shanghai market is refuted by the above circumstances.</p>
<p>In-Depth Study of the Actual Situation</p>
<p>Although the mission of Mr. Kirkland's trip to Shanghai is in principle similar to that of Mr. Fox, the American representative of the Exchange Equalization Fund, and Dr. Taylor, his assistant, Mr. Kirkland's arrival is particularly significant because it comes after the Three-Nation Economic Conference in Chongqing and at the time of the Hong Kong Financial Conference. According to well-informed sources, Mr. Kirkland's mission is to conduct a thorough investigation of Shanghai's import trade, the extent to which the Shanghai market needs imported goods, the complex commercial interests of various countries in Shanghai, and to define the status of friendly and non-friendly nations. He will also examine the true situation of Shanghai's abnormal black market foreign exchange, explore the reasons for its formation and methods to prevent it, and determine the amount of foreign exchange allocated by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee for Shanghai's import of goods, so that all types of trade can benefit from it and not be exclusively enjoyed by a few special trades with preferential foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Film Industry Representative Returns to Shanghai on the Same Ship</p>
<p>Mr. Hague, the representative of Asia Film Company, who went to Hong Kong last month with representatives from other industries in Shanghai to contact the Exchange Equalization Fund on the issue of foreign exchange, returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Ming Sheng ship with Mr. Kirkland. Although Mr. Hague was unwilling to disclose the specific measures decided by the Exchange Equalization Fund regarding the film industry's request for foreign exchange, he indicated that the consultation had yielded considerable results and was not completely hopeless.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Problem May Be Solved Soon</p>
<p>It is understood that Mr. Hague stayed in Hong Kong for a long time and consulted with the Exchange Equalization Fund several times in order to obtain sufficient foreign exchange so that Shanghai cinemas could continue to operate without being affected by the U.S. freezing order. According to Mr. Hague, he has reported the progress of this trip to the authorities of Asia Film Company, and the issue of whether it can continue to operate can be resolved soon. Some film merchants also told reporters that they believe that unless sufficient foreign exchange is obtained and remitted to the United States to pay for film prices, they will have to stop operating. If American film merchants stop operating, the source of American films needed by Shanghai will be cut off. According to film merchants, recently officials in Chongqing have requested the import of a large number of American films to be transported to Free China, and the Exchange Equalization Fund should consider their request.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Store Goods Should Be Marked with Prices <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Stores in the French Concession should mark the prices of their goods in accordance with the police regulations. However, someone sent a letter to the newspaper expressing dissatisfaction with some stores that do not comply. The French Concession authorities hope that all sectors will cooperate with the Price Evaluation Committee and report to the nearby police station if they encounter stores that do not mark the prices of the goods they sell.</p>
<h3 id="e42">The International Merchants Corps Seeks Members to Strengthen Defense Forces <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Merchants Corps in the Public Concession recently stated that the defense of "Zone B" is important, and because more than 200 British members have left Shanghai to join the military in the past two years, it has launched a campaign to recruit new members in order to strengthen its strength. The Corps' Motor Patrol held its annual meeting the day before, where Acting Commander Lieutenant Hans Lai gave a speech, urging all members to recruit new members to increase defense capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="e43">There Is Absolutely No Problem with the Supply of Imported Rice by the Public Works Department <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>If Rice Shops Refuse to Sell, They Can Be Reported to the Police for Investigation. Underground Transactions in the Rice Market Must Be Stopped</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that some rice shops selling foreign rice from the Bureau have been reported to refuse to sell, claiming that they are out of stock. Therefore, it is hereby re-announced that if citizens discover the above situation, they are requested to immediately report to the nearest police station for verification. At the same time, no one or any organization is allowed to purchase the Bureau's foreign rice except for self-use, and no one may purchase more than one month's supply. The Bureau currently has a sufficient supply of foreign rice in stock to meet all needs. There is absolutely no reason to worry about the supply.</p>
<p>Afternoon Rice Market Needs to Be Stopped Urgently</p>
<p>Although the industry trading rules of the Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Edward Road have been repeatedly promulgated, they have ultimately been rendered useless due to the influence of speculators. In particular, the ban on afternoon grain trading has been repeatedly announced by the industry association, and the French Concession Police Department has also ordered compliance. However, these rice dealers are deliberately defying the regulations and secretly buying and selling grain in the market every afternoon, deliberately driving up prices and seriously harming people's food supply. This illegal trading is becoming increasingly rampant. If it continues to spread, the future of the people's food supply will be seriously affected. It is hoped that the French Concession authorities will immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the black market in the market in order to stabilize the market situation.</p>
<p>Rice Market Actually Pricing in Gold</p>
<p>The abundance of food reserves in the city is rare in recent decades, and it is the most abundant period since the war. Moreover, the source of domestic and foreign rice continues to arrive, and the monthly amount transported to Shanghai is considerable. According to the Jianghai Customs report, the total amount of foreign rice transported to Shanghai in September reached 447,673 hectoliters, valued at 4,751 customs gold units, equivalent to 12,735,761 yuan in national currency. At the same time, domestic rice transported to Shanghai is also more convenient and abundant. What is the prospect of the people's food supply? However, rice merchants are single-mindedly aiming to obtain illegal profits, resulting in the entire rice market being suddenly tight and difficult to alleviate. Recently, rice merchants in the market have even been pricing based on the rise and fall of gold. Such illegal activities cannot be allowed to continue to exist and urgently need to be strictly prohibited by the authorities.</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperation Can Achieve Great Results</p>
<p>By observing the current situation, we can see that most businesses in recent years have had a mentality of only seeking short-term gains and disregarding the consequences. A year ago, it was suggested that the only way to curb rising prices and make prices consistent with the purchasing power of money is to organize a consumer association. The association should have broad powers and, if necessary, can conduct consumer cooperative enterprises and sell goods to members at the lowest profit. In other words, the association can control the prices of daily necessities, so that the public can live, not just survive.</p>
<p>Cutting Off Contact with Black Market Transactions</p>
<p>The current French Municipal Council and the Public Works Department have implemented price controls, but they have only achieved partial results. It is heard that both parties are considering setting prices again, but it is feared that only partial success will be achieved. Why? Because there is no powerful consumer association to back them up. If there is a consumer association, it can cooperate with the authorities. The members of the association will unanimously refuse to purchase goods exceeding the regulated selling price from the black market or unregistered merchants.</p>
<p>Illegal Transactions Should Be Punished</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, people who purchase goods from unregistered merchants at prices exceeding the government's regulated prices will be fined, including both the customer and the merchant. Will the Public Works Department also implement this method? For example, those who hoard gasoline will be fined 30 yuan. This measure will not prohibit hoarding but will only encourage it. In short, in any price control measure, it is difficult to succeed without the support of consumers and registered merchants.</p>
<p>Hoarding Goods Is Dangerous in the Future</p>
<p>Those who fear the outbreak of war and hoard goods in order to raise prices for sale should consider the actual advantages and disadvantages. If the war really comes to Shanghai due to Japan's attack on the United Kingdom and the United States, then regardless of who occupies Shanghai, whether for military or civilian needs, these warehouses full of goods will undoubtedly be requisitioned. It can be seen that hoarding goods during wartime is truly self-defeating. Those who hope to profit will inevitably lose. At that time, the general public will also believe that hoarders should share the same hardships as the rest of society, and no one will sympathize with their losses.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreigners Share the Same Interests</p>
<p>At present, the war may not come, but those who hoard and profit still exist. Then, they will be allowed to use the guns made of their warehouses to do whatever they want to the people. If there is an organization of Chinese and foreign consumer associations, how can they act recklessly? In short, the price issue has the same meaning for both Chinese and foreigners, that is, the issue of the purchasing power of money. It is firmly believed that a strong consumer association can solve various consumer problems and solve the difficulties encountered by the authorities in the two concessions, and the purchasing power of millions of people can also be increased.</p>

<p>Immigrant Council Meets Today, Discussing Banning Aid to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai White Russian Immigration Committee is scheduled to meet on the 26th (today) to discuss increasing income tax on members and intensifying the ban on members continuing to support the Soviet Union. 30,000 White Russians in Shanghai are waiting for the results of this meeting. They have little complaint about the increase in income tax, but the vast majority of them completely sympathize with the Soviet Union, regardless of the policies of the Immigration Committee. Furthermore, the Committee threatens members who sympathize with the Soviet Union with depriving them of their membership. Many White Russian leaders have expressed resentment about this. At the same time, the number of White Russian immigrants donating to the Soviet Red Cross is increasing every day. Hundreds of people have applied to the Soviet Consulate in Tokyo for Soviet citizenship due to the ambiguous attitude of the Immigration Committee. Many believe that the decision of the Immigration Committee has given White Russians here a greater opportunity to obtain Soviet passports.</p>

<p>By Mr. Mense, Scheduled to Leave Shanghai Next Tuesday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Tait Pomp, the former deputy executive officer of the U.S. Court for China, who was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement of public property and concealment of the truth, will be escorted back to McNeil Island Penitentiary in the United States. Due to the difficulty in obtaining cabin space on ships between Shanghai and San Francisco, and the lack of anyone to escort him back to the United States, Tait is currently imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison. U.S. Marshal Mr. Mense, who has retired as the director of the Traffic Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, will depart for Seattle to work for the U.S. government. He was asked to be responsible for escorting Tait back to the United States. Mr. Mense was sworn in as a special deputy executive officer at the U.S. Court on Thursday and is scheduled to escort Tait to board the French Postal Company's Dada Nanhao next Tuesday to leave Shanghai and land in Manila. Tait will be temporarily detained in the local prison for about five days, and then board the President Holbrook to San Francisco and then to McNeil Island, where Tait will be handed over to the prison authorities.

<p>Assist the Authorities in Effectively Managing Prices, Refuse to Purchase Goods Exceeding the Price</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published an article yesterday, which is translated as follows. According to economic principles, prices increase faster than wages, and wages fall faster than prices. However, this principle seems to no longer apply to Shanghai, just as other economic principles do not apply to Shanghai. The so-called wages do not refer to the currency circulating in Shanghai. Currency is merely a symbol. Every worker, whether Chinese or foreign, is greatly related to the purchasing power of money. If supply and demand can be adjusted to maintain the normal state of purchasing power, the social situation may not be so pessimistic. The misapplication of economic principles has led to various adverse environments.</p>

<p>All Equipment Provided for American Military Use, Weekly Film Screenings and Dances</p>
<p>The U.S. 4th Marines Club was originally located opposite the Zonghui on Xiejiao Road in Jing'an Temple Road, but because the building was sold to the Jewish General Association for one million yuan, it was sold at the beginning of this month. However, as there were no suitable buildings available for the time being, the club's work was suspended. The department originally intended to rent the Baishanjing Hall on Avenue Edward VII and the fifth floor of the Great World Company, but neither was successful. According to news yesterday, after compromise negotiations, the department has decided to rent the Navy YMCA on Sichuan Road as the club's location. Yesterday, the U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai announced that the staff of the Navy YMCA have agreed to provide all the equipment of the association for the use of the U.S. military. The success of this matter is entirely due to the cooperation and assistance of Mr. Su Sen, the general secretary of the association. As for the club's schedule, there will be film screenings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Starting next week, there will be dances every Saturday night from 8:00 pm to 11:15 pm.

<p>Accused of Illegally Setting Up Radio Station in the French Concession, Unwilling to Be a Prisoner, Dies by Suicide</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that White Russian General Molochkovsky, 45, who had served as a military advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and participated in military affairs in the Chinese army, lived at 559D Route Lafayette. The French Concession Police Department discovered that he had set up a secret radio station in the concession. At 8:05 am this morning (the 26th), they went to his residence to arrest him. Mr. Mo shot himself.</p>
<p>Radio Station Uncovered, Involving Mr. Mo</p>
<p>The matter was subsequently officially announced by the French Police Department. It was stated that a secret radio station was uncovered yesterday (the 25th) at 19 Route Tenant de la Tour, and a Chinese radio operator was arrested. Under strict interrogation, it was learned that the radio station was managed by a White Russian. Therefore, this morning, detectives were sent to Mr. Mo's residence at 559D Route Lafayette. According to an officer of the French Police Department, the detectives only wanted to conduct an inquiry.</p>
<p>Detectives Arrive, Suicide by Shooting</p>
<p>However, when Mr. Mo saw the detectives enter his residence, he immediately shot himself. The bullet entered his temple and he died instantly. At the time, Mr. Mo's wife and two young children were also in the residence. It was found that Mr. Mo had become a Chinese citizen and had assisted Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for many years. However, it is believed that he severed relations about eight months ago and has been working in Shanghai for private organizations in Chongqing for the past few months. During the Shanghai War in 1932, Mr. Mo participated in the planning in the 88th Division, assisting the 19th Route Army in fighting in Zhabei and Jiangwan. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Mr. Mo commanded a column of armored trains at the North Railway Station and Zhabei, covering the retreat of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Long Time in China, Participated in Important Matters</p>
<p>Mr. Mo's first wife died in South China, leaving behind two sons. Mr. Mo then remarried and brought his family to Shanghai two years ago. In 1926, Mr. Mo first came to China from Siberia and served under Zhang Zongchang. In 1928, he managed the military trains in North China. The following year, he joined Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and was appointed as a general in the Chinese National Army.</p>
<p>Four Chinese Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the Public Concession Police Department, together with the Japanese Military Police, arrested four Chinese radio operators in the Public Concession this morning (the 26th).

<h3 id="e59">The Struggle for Luo Jialing's Estate Intensifies After Her Death <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Two Wills Discovered with Complex Content, Competition for the Estate Intensifies</p>
<p>The Jewish tycoon Hardoon and his wife, Luo Jialing, passed away one after the other. The distribution of their enormous estate, valued at eighty million yuan, has attracted widespread attention. Currently, there are four parties competing for the estate, and the four-way battle has just begun, with the situation</p>
<p>Escalating</p>
<p>This was to be expected, and even impartial observers are unable to predict the outcome. According to yesterday’s Shanghai Times, one of the parties contesting the estate consists of ten individuals residing in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, who claim to be close relatives of the late Hardoon. They have engaged Okamoto, a Japanese lawyer in this city, to represent them and demand 65.2% of Hardoon’s estate. It is reported that Okamoto has already submitted a notice to the British Assessor’s Office on behalf of his clients, stating that the</p>
<p>Estate Distribution Method</p>
<p>Determined by Luo Jialing is illegal because Luo Jialing was a Chinese citizen, not a British citizen. The dispute over Hardoon’s estate began even before Luo Jialing’s death on October 3. Last month, ten individuals named Hardoon, residing in Baghdad, requested 65.2% of the estate, claiming that this amount was stipulated by Iraqi inheritance law, as the late Hardoon was originally from Iraq and later became a British citizen. Okamoto, the Japanese lawyer, was entrusted by these ten individuals to</p>
<p>Make This Request</p>
<p>To Luo Jialing, but received no response. With Luo Jialing’s sudden death at the beginning of this month, the competition for the estate became even more intense. According to Luo Jialing’s will, the lawyers Abraham and Laid from Gao Yi Law Firm were appointed as estate administrators, and the British Assessor’s Office was requested to verify the will. Anyone who believed that the will should not be executed was required to declare their objections to the two lawyers within ten days. Before the ten days were up, another party suddenly argued that Luo Jialing was a Chinese citizen,</p>
<p>Not a British Subject</p>
<p>And therefore had no right to dispose of the estate, lodging a protest with the British Consulate General in Shanghai. Reliable sources report that diplomatic action is currently being taken on this matter. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Luo Jialing had left a second will, written after the first will, dated September 30, 1937, rendering the first will invalid. The exact date on which it was drawn up</p>
<p>Second Will</p>
<p>Was handled by Rogers, an American lawyer at the law firm of Rogers, and a notice has also been sent to the British Assessor’s Office. Notably, the first will appointed Laid and Abraham as estate administrators, while the second will replaced Laid with Ji Juemi as administrator alongside Abraham.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Puyi Arts and Crafts Society Solicits Rags and Old Clothes, Raising Funds to Aid and Educate Disaster Victims <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>In view of the suffering of many refugees who are starving, cold, exposed to the elements, the Puyi Arts and Crafts Society has been organizing arts and crafts relief work for three and a half years. Fortunately, thanks to the support of all sectors of society, it has been able to continue to this day. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficulties in providing supplies, in order to maintain all existing programs and expand the scope of relief, it launched a 50,000-yuan fundraising campaign last week, hoping that people from all walks of life will actively support and cooperate.</p>
<p>Relief Numbers</p>
<p>The society provides daily relief to more than 1,000 elderly, weak, and disabled refugees, including 250 refugee workers who are provided with food, clothing, and wages to sustain their lives, as well as vocational training in over 40 different skills. Over 500 are orphans and out-of-school children, whom the society educates and cares for so that they can study and learn. Over 300 are refugees suffering from various diseases, to whom the society provides free medical care, distributing cod liver oil, oatmeal, and other foods as needed to supplement their inadequate nutrition. Another 200 or so are elderly, sick, unable to work, pregnant, giving birth, or bereaved, whom the society assists by distributing rice, wheat, and cash to prevent these impoverished people from becoming beggars.</p>
<p>Training Refugee Workers</p>
<p>The society trains hundreds of male and female refugee workers every day, utilizing old clothes, rags, furniture, machinery, toys, and other waste materials donated by all sectors of society, under the guidance of technicians or foremen, to train them so that "everything is used to its fullest potential, and everyone is used to their fullest potential." After a certain period, efforts are made to introduce them to work in various places to promote the spirit of self-reliance. Since this newspaper introduced the society, people from all walks of life have been writing to the society, entrusting it to find talent and arrange introductions, and then training unemployed vagrants or refugees to fill their vacancies. Such extensive relief not only reduces the number of vagrants foraging along the streets, posing a serious threat to citizens, but also prevents sick beggars from dying on the streets and spreading disease.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Support</p>
<p>Since the society launched the 50,000-yuan disaster relief fundraising campaign, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have actively supported it, donating cash or clothing, which has been increasing daily, demonstrating that the society's active arts and crafts relief has won the sympathy of society. However, the target is still far away, and continued support is hoped for. This week, the society has received 300 yuan from Xi Shijing, 100 yuan from Zhang Daosheng, 1,010 yuan raised by Tang Shuming, 100 yuan from the estate of Ms. Chen Shufang, 200 yuan from Ms. Zhu Jizhen, 500 yuan from Chengdetang, 100 yuan from Lida Foreign Company, 400 yuan raised by Ding Dafu, 2,821 yuan raised by Qingxin Girls' School, 490 yuan jointly donated by 16 others, 235 yuan from three Westerners, totaling 6,256 yuan in cash. In addition, Tongyi Yarn Factory donated a large package of 20-count yarn worth over 2,000 yuan. Those who wish to donate, please call 16082 or notify the society's office at 115 Hankou Road, 2nd floor.</p>

<p>Movie Stars Avenge Their Loss with a Great Victory Over Performing Arts Friends - Winning in Overtime</p>
<p>The charity basketball tournament to benefit education unfolded its fifth act yesterday, still held at the Paramount court on Jessfield Road. Blue and White severely defeated Paramount with a score of 50 to 42 last week. Unfortunately, in yesterday's game, Blue and White's main player, Bao Songyuan, was ejected for four fouls, and the team was left without a leader, resulting in a crushing defeat of 31 to 46. In the intermission, Central China and Hua Nan tied at 27 to 27. In overtime, Central China finally defeated Hua Nan with a score of 37 to 32. In the second intermission show, the plump star Gu Xiucen substituted for Zhou Xuan to perform the opening ceremony. The movie stars, in extremely unfavorable circumstances, defeated their performing arts friends with a score of 33 to 16, washing away their previous humiliation. In the final game, Blue and White's Bao Songyuan scored the first point. Paramount's offense was strong, and Blue and White's counterattack resulted in a tie of 9 to 9. Paramount narrowly won the first half with a score of 19 to 18. In the second half, Paramount's Chen Xianglong worked hard, and Zhang Shaoqing made every shot. After a long struggle, Bao Songyuan was ejected for four fouls, and Blue and White became even more unsustainable. As a result, Paramount defeated Blue and White with a score of 46 to 31.</p>

<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>"The 20th century is the century of children," which is something that modern children can be very proud of. But children, don't forget that the 20th century is also a century of science. Therefore, the children of the 20th century must have a scientific mind and a pair of scientific hands to cope with the scientific century of the 20th century in order to be worthy of being the masters of this century.</p>
<p>The "Nature" that children learn in school is the subject that enhances your scientific knowledge and can turn your mind into a scientific mind. You should study hard, think deeply, study carefully, and seek a thorough understanding. Outside of class, you should also read more scientific books and newspapers, and often come into contact with nature to observe everything in the natural world and acquire rich scientific knowledge to enrich your scientific mind.</p>
<p>Having a scientific mind alone is not enough. You also need a pair of scientific hands. "Use your hands and your brain, that's the best!" Have you seen this slogan? A pair of scientific hands can only be created through experimentation. Therefore, once you have scientific knowledge, you should do scientific experiments yourself.</p>
<p>Combining your hands and brain in this way can not only increase your interest in research, but also create new things. You must know that any great inventor is not a natural freak. Our brains and hands are no different from theirs. Those who have the will can also achieve it.</p>
<p>Dear children! Our country is now struggling in suffering. Shouldn't we catch up quickly, take on the mission of promoting science, and catch up?</p>
<p>One day, Brother Duck and Little Chicken went out to play together. Little Chicken disappeared halfway. Brother Duck looked for it for a long time but couldn't find it. Children! Can you find it for him?</p>

<h3 id="e73">Rotary Club and Old Toys <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow Dull</p>
<p>We've probably heard the term "Rotary Club" a lot, right? It's an organization, but its structure is different from other groups. Regardless of nationality, men and women from all countries can join. Meetings are held weekly, and the convener is rotated among the members, hence the name "Rotary Club." Moreover, the meetings are informal. A unique aspect is that members absolutely do not discuss political issues at gatherings.</p>
<p>The Rotary Club's history is only about thirty years old. It was initially founded by a few people in Chicago, USA. However, today, after thirty years, the Rotary Club has spread throughout the world, with thousands of branches. The number of members is also in the tens of thousands, demonstrating rapid growth. In China, major cities like Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shanghai now have Rotary Clubs.</p>
<p>The Rotary Club's purpose is twofold: to foster camaraderie among members and to engage in charitable activities. For example, the Shanghai Rotary Club, in addition to its regular weekly meetings on Thursdays, always does charity work during Christmas. A special activity is collecting toys for underprivileged children. Besides placing advertisements in newspapers to solicit old toys, they also screen films for the public, charging no admission fee, only accepting new or used toys, one per person.</p>
<p>Although the current situation is very chaotic, the Rotary Club is continuing this work this year because they realize that there are many children in charitable institutions who never see toys all year round, which is very pitiful. Therefore, they collect old toys, repair them, and distribute them to poor children before Christmas as gifts so they can play with toys like other children.</p>
<p>On October 26th, this Sunday, at 10:30 AM, the Rotary Club will publicly screen a new film for toy collection at the Nanjing Grand Theater. You don't have to spend money to see the movie; just bring an old toy. Fortunately, old toys are useless at home. Giving them can provide toys for underprivileged children, which is killing two birds with one stone. What wouldn't the children want to do that!</p>
<p>The Rotary Club has a "toy hospital" and employs many experts to repair toys. Therefore, after the collected old toys are repaired by the toy hospital, they are as good as new. Every year, they use various methods to collect old toys from all walks of life. After repairing them, they distribute them to underprivileged children throughout Shanghai during Christmas. Isn't this a charitable work worth supporting?</p>
<h3 id="e74">I Dropped Out of School <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>I am a person without perseverance. Not to mention anything else, I don't even have perseverance in studying. My parents paid my tuition, and I should have studied hard; but my temper is terrible, and I insisted on learning a trade day and night. Finally, I dropped out of school one day last Saturday and joined a pharmaceutical factory. There, the huge machines required me to work twelve hours a day. After two days, I couldn't take it anymore, so I returned home; but because of this, I dropped out of school.</p>
<p>Children! After reading the above, I hope you will focus on your studies and not be as lacking in perseverance as I was, disappointing your parents' efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e75">More About the Most Powerful Airplane <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Last time, A-Wei's brother only talked about the interesting anecdotes of a silent airplane. Because he had something to do, he interrupted his story. Therefore, A-Wei was always looking for a good opportunity to ask his brother to continue the story because he was really enjoying it. Finally, one afternoon, in the evening, his brother was lying on the sofa reading the newspaper. He seized this opportunity and said to his brother, "Brother, didn't you promise me last time that if you had the chance, you would continue talking about the most powerful airplane? Isn't today a good opportunity? Can you continue the story? I like hearing about airplanes the most."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's continue. Last time, I talked about the silent airplane. Today, I'm talking about a type of airplane that can be equipped with a large cannon, which can also be considered the most powerful airplane. This type of airplane equipped with a cannon was invented by the British and has now been successfully developed. It is said that this airplane can fly more than two hundred miles per hour, which is a good speed. Moreover, it can fire cannons while flying and can accurately hit the target. The person firing the cannon can sit safely in the airplane's cabin, aiming at the target to be attacked. No matter what the position, the cannonball is guaranteed to hit the target once fired because the cannonball is fired not manually but entirely by an automatic device, just like the cannons on armored warships. There is also a type of airplane that spreads anti-aircraft dust. This type of airplane does not attack the enemy but defends against enemy airplanes indiscriminately bombing cities. It was also invented by the British. It is said that this anti-aircraft dust is a metallic powder similar to smoke. As soon as an alarm is heard that enemy airplanes are approaching, the anti-aircraft airplanes immediately ascend into the air to spread the anti-aircraft dust. Just a few airplanes can quickly create a layer of invisible anti-aircraft dust around the sky of an important city. If any enemy airplane enters this dust, the metallic powder can damage the enemy airplane's engine, preventing it from advancing and causing it to crash. If the enemy airplane already knows the height of the anti-aircraft dust and wants to fly above it, it is a difficult task, especially for large bombers. Therefore, this is a safe and effective anti-aircraft method, but it is not easy to use, so we have not yet seen this method used for air defense in newspapers. There is also a type of smoke-spraying airplane that looks like a military airplane, but it is equipped with a machine for spraying asphalt (commonly called tar) smoke. When bombing, it does not need to fly low to drop bombs. It can simply drop bombs made of asphalt, poison, and easily combustible chemicals from the air. The bomb will spray smoke in the air before landing, burning the enemy's supplies and suffocating soldiers. This type of airplane is very scary. Finally, there is a type of mysterious airplane invented by the Americans that uses radio waves to automatically pilot itself, so there is no need for a person in the airplane. It is said to have flown over the Pacific Ocean for three hours at a fast speed, and the result is considered successful. In wartime, as long as this type of airplane is fully loaded with bombs and flown to the enemy to bomb, if there is an accident, at most an airplane is lost, without sacrificing the lives of any soldiers. These are the most powerful airplanes."</p>

<p>Since Dr. Wang Boyuan took charge of the Chinese Hospital, he has carefully planned and prepared on a large scale. The internal organization is well-structured, and the various facilities are complete. The main departments include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, cardiology, gastroenterology, dermatology, urology and reproductive medicine, emergency poisoning treatment, otolaryngology, X-ray, physical therapy, electrotherapy, etc. Each department is staffed by specialized physicians responsible for treatment. With their rich experience, they fulfill their professional duties to the fullest. Therefore, patients who seek treatment often recover quickly, and the hospital has gained a good reputation, with its services becoming increasingly developed, benefiting patients greatly. The hospital is affiliated with the Hongkou Public Obstetrics Hospital, which provides safe childbirth services with remarkable results. It also provides free childbirth services to extremely impoverished mothers, offering dedicated service and earning the praise of society. The hospital's main address is at Huajie Road, Tilanqiao, and the branch is at Xinzhazhi Road, Park Road. The telephone numbers are 50004 and 37047. There are no other branches.</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>On Tan Fuying's Voice</p>
<p>Every actor's voice changes due to environmental factors: (1) With increasing age, the voice changes from a boy's voice to a young adult's voice, and then to an old voice; (2) The diligence or laziness in using the voice. If the voice is not used often, it becomes stiff, like rusty steel; (3) The strength or weakness of the body. A strong body has abundant energy, and the voice is loud and powerful. Weakness and illness lead to shortness of breath and an empty voice. Tan Fuying was only twelve or thirteen years old when he entered the Fuyuncheng opera school. I heard him sing opera for the first time when he made his debut. The voice was a boy's voice, and the tune was the ordinary tune of the opera school. He had a good appearance and was much fatter than he is now, which was very pleasing. Later, he lost his voice, and it took a long time for his voice to come back. The key was very low, and singing was very strenuous. Therefore, he changed to a low tune to cope with his voice, inevitably using a bit of a nasal tone. This lasted for a long time. Later, seeing Ma Shuliang stand out, he began to work hard and was able to train his voice to be very wide, high, and loud, leaping to a level playing field with Ma Lianliang. For several years, the two Mas, in order to safeguard the friendship between colleagues and classmates, gave way to each other and refused to compete on two stages in Shanghai at the same time, which was a good approach. Last time when Fuying performed at the Gengxin Theater, I listened to him several times. His voice was wide and bright, and he was very energetic. This time, he is performing on the Grand Stage again. People who have heard him sing say that his voice is slightly narrower than last time, which makes me very concerned. I heard Fuying sing "The Tassel Unseating" that day. This play is an old one with a good meaning, but the atmosphere was a bit cold, and there were not many singing lines. Many people did not find it very satisfying, and I will not comment on it. I will only discuss his voice. How does it compare to his performance last time? Last year at the Gengxin Theater, Fuying's voice was so wide that it could be called invincible, but I carefully tasted his voice and felt that it was wide but not tight. One piece of evidence is that he could not sing in a high falsetto because he could not tighten his throat. Now, I hear his voice in "The Tassel Unseating" and feel that it is more full and tight than last year. When he sings loudly, it can also resonate throughout the hall. Judging from this, Fuying's voice has improved, and he should be able to sing in a high falsetto. This is good news. His father, Xiao Pei, should say, "Let me thank heaven and earth." His grandfather, Yingxiu, if he knew in the afterlife, would also smile and say, "With this voice, he is worthy of being a descendant of the Tan family." I also have good advice to offer. I advise Fuying to pursue his singing skills further, take good care of his body, so that we can listen to him and relieve our sorrows.</p>

<p>One Toy for One Ticket</p>
<p>Although the world is full of terror, time passes so quickly, and Christmas is not far away.

<p>The screening of this toy-collecting film will continue this year. The first screening is scheduled for today (Sunday) at 10:30 AM at the Nanjing Grand Theater. The films screened include cartoons, newsreels, and comedies, covering a wide range of genres.</p>
<p>People who want to see the movie don't have to spend money; just bring a toy to exchange for a ticket. The condition of the toy, whether new or old, doesn't matter. If you don't have a toy, there will be toys for sale at the theater entrance that day.</p>
<p>All the old toys collected will be immediately sent to the Rotary Club's toy hospital for repair so that they can be distributed to underprivileged children in charitable institutions throughout the city during Christmas as a gift. The Rotary Club's target is to collect 10,000 toys. Therefore, after the first public screening at the Nanjing Grand Theater, it may also be screened at other theaters.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Swearing to Wipe Out the Huns Regardless of Personal Safety</p>
<p>"I was born with copper muscles and iron bones. General Wu doesn't order me to kill a few more rebels happily on the battlefield, but instead orders me to be a Kunlun slave, stealing the red silk for him. Although I, Lao Zhang, am a rough martial artist, calculating it, it's not worth it, unlike in times of peace, when I was raised by General Wu, it wouldn't hurt to do it for him. But at this moment, I don't want to be a private lackey." Chen Fei said, "If General Wu could decide to fight the rebels, he should have raised his troops and horses long ago and attacked Beijing, that would be the right thing to do, so that his beloved concubine could be rescued from the hands of the rebels. Who told him to retreat here, allowing the rebels to be rampant?" Bai Shier saw that everyone did not agree with San Gui's request. He knew that Zhang Cangqiu and others were heroic and straightforward in temperament. No matter what happened, they spoke frankly and did not flatter private interests. Since they all said so, this matter was unlikely to be hopeful, so he said, "I am just conveying General Wu's meaning. If you are not willing to go, of course I would not dare to force you. Let's drink a few more cups." Zhang Cangqiu said, "If you want to teach me to drink, I will obey. 'Don't laugh at me for lying drunk on the battlefield; since ancient times, how many have returned from battle?' If I drink enough wine and go out to fight once, I will die happily. Now retreating here is really discouraging, I can't agree." Liu Yinying smiled and said, "I now know that General Wu's temperament is very hesitant and indecisive, lacking determination. It is very difficult to ask him to take on a major responsibility. My previous words unfortunately came true. It seems that his heart is completely tied to his beloved concubine, and national affairs are secondary to him." (202)</p>
