<p>社評</p>
<h3>變態的國際局勢與危機</h3>
<p>德國這次竟得規避和排除了蘇聯與土耳其以及其他的一切國際阻力，一舉而進佔保加利亞，又完成了國際的另一閃電戰。這原來是土保簽訂互不侵犯條的後必然的發展，所以値得驚異之點，不在這次德軍入保，而在前此土耳其態度的突然轉變；而英國艾登與狄爾等人的急速訪問巴爾幹，正是企圖補救搶堵這一個漏洞。現在保加利亞的運命已經確定了，這一帶其他的可能發展、却在積極醞釀之中。所可注意的：德國大軍出現在土耳其邊境上以後，土耳其對於戰略地位的考慮，以及蘇聯在這一方面的立塲，究將如何？其次，保加利亞這次接受德國的控制，是採取加入所謂「新秩序」的方式；蘇土兩國與新秩序的緩衝地帶自此撒除，而軸心勢方亦已向巴爾幹與近東猛進；故兩國對於新秩序，或承認，或反對，已到了必選擇其一的關隘；徘徊餘地、愈縮愈小，戰爭危機，愈迫愈近，然則兩國究將如何？</p>
<p>嚴格的說，這次一方面是德國的暫時勝利，另一方面，除了英希所受打擊而外，蘇土所受戰略地位的損失，及所招安全上的危機，亦甚嚴重。溯本窮源，英蘇邦交始終未能調整，是這次英希蘇土保五國不幸遭遇的最大禍根，且其為禍尙在繼續不斷的發展之中；也許會有更驚八的國際事件出現，給軸心國以分頭個別擊破的可乘之隙。急起直追，怎樣調整彼此邦交，怎樣齊一彼此步驟，這不獨是英希當前的緊急課題，同時也是蘇土兩國方面的緊急課題。</p>
<p>僅就巴爾幹的形勢來看，德國這次進兵保加利亞的作用，顯然是在挽救義大利；牠的第二步，當不外是壓迫希臘，接受與義大別休戰談和的提議，而恐怕並不是逕直對希臘用兵。這一點從最近幾天來德國，義大利，土耳其及保加利亞四國所發出的種種言論上，皆可以得釗一個相富的徵象。此其歸宿，却有絕大岐途：一是英希因種種關係，由希臘忍痛屈服了；一是英希毅然抗戰到底，待決於疆塲；一是土耳其堅決以實力反對德國攻進希臘、蘇聯同時完全支持土耳其這一立塲。三條岐途，各有其相當可行的理由。其中關鍵，要視艾登前幾天在土京及目前在希京所活動，究得如何成果；而最近將來的英希實際舉措，將予世人以具體的答復。推其影響所及，遠東局勢，亦將感受莫大的波動。蓋東方暴力主義者，或視此為可乘之隙，一則威脅英美而悍然南進，二則努力於調整對蘇邦交，二者皆成題中應有之義了。</p>
<p>昨夜最後消息，蘇土英等國均已分別表明自己堅定的立塲，這是國際形勢好轉的重要端倪；不過僅此口頭與紙片的表明，絕對不足以阻遏惡化；事實的好轉，端倪的後勁，惟繫於反對暴力者緊密而迅速的協同動作！</p>
<h3>二屆國民參政會議　蔣委員長演詞　爭取最後勝利完成安全國防</h3>
<p>重慶　（續昨）在目前世界大變局中、我們中國的地位、已因三年餘的血戰而提高、然而我們中國的責氏、亦從此格外加重、這幾年以來、中國不獨是保衛和平的先覺、也做了保衛和平的前衛、到了此時、更證明了中國是捍衛象西和平正義的主要力量、中國作戰的堅決有效、旣增加了世界對我的同情與信賴、並使中國與一切利害共同國家、關係更臻密切、中國的作戰已不是一個單獨的孤立事件、而成為世界安危治亂所關的主要因素了、在這一個新形勢之下、本人要請我全體參政員同人、以及我全國同胞、共同認淸我國的目標、作更進一步的努力、什麼是我們的目標呢、我鄭重的吿訴各位、第一作戰必須爭取</p>
<p>最後勝利　第二建國必須達到國防絕對安全、三民中義所要建設的國家、是一個國防鞏固、民海發展、民生樂利的國家、三民主義的國防建設、是以自衛為目的、所以不獨不致妨碍民權和民生、而正是要使民權和民生　在國防安全的保障下、得到眞實和永久的解決、今天我們的國力、雖有長足進步、國際形勢亦復十分有利、但爲了爭取我們最後勝利、適應世界大局、克盡我們中國更重大的責任、必須要求我全國國民有澈底的自覺、須知我們過去之努力、尙不足適應今後之需要、必須要求國民覺悟、惟有完成我們絕對完全的國防、纔得完成我們作戰建國全部的工作、因此</p>
<p>一切建設　必須國防化、全體國民必須军事化、根據這個認識、本人要向各位提出下列意見、希望由各位而普遍達到全國的同胞、第一、在政治方面、我全國同胞必須認識一切黨派觀念、及所謂左傾右傾之意識理論、已經是陳腐落他的舊時代的空談、不能適應今天的世界了、我們必須正視世界森嚴的現實、並接受作戰中的痛苦敎訓、以建設絕對安全之國防爲第一目標、歐戰證明、惟有能戰鬥能勝利之國家、始得保其獨立生存、否則必被征服、而為奴隸、而且因為現在軍事技衛的進步、及經濟宰制的嚴密、一旦被人征服、將永永沒有以自力恢復獨立之希望、今天以後被征服的民族、永遠不得翻身、這是與二十年三十年前絕對不同的、所以在今天、惟有適於戰鬥的政治、始為新時代的政治，能够自衛、始克保障民治、不能戰鬥、即在民治可言、試看已經亡國的國民、還有什麼資格講民治、同樣資本與勞動、在被征服國家、一切都為征服者所有、而一切政治上的主張、一經亡國、均歸無用、中國國民黨所致力的國民革命、第一目的在救國、在求中國之自由平等、所以中國國民黨、一貫以</p>
<p>凝結民力　鞏固國防為任務、不獨從來洞察國防之重要、呼號於國民之前、現在更組織起全國同胞、作空前自衛之血戰、而為完成這一任務起見、決無黨派成見可言、惟有要求全體同胞、向保衛國家之唯一目標、共同奮鬥、在政府方面、自當整飭紀網、以提高行政效率、推行地方民治、以確立民治根基、國民大會雖延期召集、但這正是要政府加重責任、來加緊推行縣以下的地方自治、造成全國各地堅强的基層組織、時代的潮流已　我們不能不負起空前艱鉅的責任、然而同時亦不得不要求全體國民、確認國族至上、國防至上的眞理、放棄一切不合時代的舊觀念、而使全國成為一個統一强固的戰鬥體、證實中國為一個足以自衛生存、與維護芷義和平的偉大力量第二在軍事方面、要求全體國民、提高對國防之認識及信仰、並耍求全體國民之思想行動與知能，一切均合於民挨戰鬬之需要、共同為加强國防力量而服務、今後建國之中心為建軍、而政治經濟敎育文化、以及國民生活、亦必須戰時組織化、以與建軍事業相配合而並進、所以一面當</p>
<p>加强軍隊　整訓、充實軍事力量、改着兵役制度、普及軍事訓練、提高戰鬬技能、一面只須提高國防意識、及戰鬬紀律、以完成建國建軍的使命、第三在經濟方面、必須趁此戰時機會、榭立國防經濟的基礎、而根據國防需要，迅速完成經濟建設的工作、此種戰時經濟建設、不僅限於現在作戰時期、且必須延長至戰後、以達絕對安全的守勢國防之日為止、為了完成這一目的、政府當採取各種步驟、以調整生產及金融、改進交通與運輸、並要求全國同胞之普遍刻苦動勞、集中資本、普及勞動、更須政府人民、一致努力保護資源發展軍需工業、提高國家生產力量、實施一切經濟活動必要之機構、培養民力、安定民生、使整個國力、不斷增長、以適應國防建設的需要、以扶植我們經濟建設的進行、本人更深信中國經濟之鞏固及開發、對於全世界有莫大之利益、國父在第一次歐戰結束時所提出之實業計劃、不特爲政府進行國防建設的基本方針、而曠觀大勢、更非完全實現此一計劃不司、因為此次大戰的規模、遠過於上次的歐戰、將來大戰結束後的機器技術、如能輸入中國、發展中國終濟、不獨可以解決世界上因經濟失調而造成之恐慌與爭奪禍息、並可奠定東亞和平的百世之基礎、不過這必須我國能在戰時樹立國防經濟基礎、且能共同一致堅苦忍痛、以完成戰時建設基本事業為前提、不自努力的國家、決無資格希望</p>
<p>國外資本　技術的援助與合作、即使有之、亦不是平等互惠的合作、這是我們應該深切明白的、此外，無論在敎育文化方面、國民生活方面、無論政府和國民、均必須根據這一方面、作更大的努力、我們必須論揚民族道德、促進科學知能、普及國民敎育、獎勵勞動服務、使國家均能盡其建設國防之大職、必須撫卹傷亡、救濟災難、優待抗屬、保護婦孺、幷推進衛生體育、以謀人口之安全與健全、總之、今天不能戰鬥就一定滅亡、沒有國防就沒有國家、沒有國防就不能保障民族的生存、更不能保陣民權和民生、三民主義的根本精神、是鞏固國防安全、以保障國民幅利、我們一切政策、一切設施、都要以國防為中心、一切是非、要根據國防來判斷、我們的軍隊必須成爲高度國防的武力、我們的政治、必須成為動員國防力量的總機構、我們的經濟、必須是培養國防力量最大的根源、我們的同胞、也必須是個個具有</p>
<p>戰鬥知能　決心為國效命、並恪守國家法令的國民、一切文化敎育事業、亦必須適合國防的需要、成為國防的一部分、我們要建設一個具有充分國防的國家、來保障民權和民生、我們必須降低個人生活到最低限度、發揮個人精力、到最高限度、我們必須放粱落伍的、狹隘的、私利派別的觀念、改正腐敗的、散漫的、苟且萎靡的習性、使全國成為一個堅强的戰鬥體、方能達到驅逐日軍的目的、因此、今後我國的施政方針、一面要澈底的執行抗建綱領、一面更要以造成健全國防的目標、本人深信今後我們全國、必須更加齊一意志、齊一行動、我們要動員及組織全國力量、爭取最後勝利、來保障三民主義的實現、同時要與一切反對侵略政策之國家民族、密切合作、以共同捍衛世界及東亞之和平、各位參政員先生、今天全世界是遭逢一絕大之變局、而我們中國正在作殊死之戰鬥、就世界來說、各國精神物質生活、均將有</p>
<p>極大變化　一切政治經濟理論、亦必有極大之變化、但有一點是毫無可疑者、必須强大新式武力、與具備現代組織之國家、始能自保生存、而凡足以削弱戰鬥力量、及不適於民族戰鬥之思想行動、必受時代之淘汰、就我們中國來說、我國因有地廣人衆物博之優良憑藉、又幸而早已發動了民族自衛之戰、國民的精神意志、正適官于新時代之奮鬥、在國際上我們又有强大忠實之同情與援助、可以說我們國家之前途、已展開了莫大的光明與希望、然而克日制勝的關鍵、全在我全體國民、能否充分認識新的世局、來作新的努力、在此世變方殷、作戰愈緊的時期、本屆參政會第一次集會、本人特將自已的信念、陳述于諸位先生及全體同胞之前、希望本屆參政會、體察時代環境、根據國家需要、集思廣益、多所貢獻、協助政府、領導人民、實現我們整個民族、爭取最後勝利、完成建設國防的便命、（二日電完）</p>

<h3>巴爾幹大戰迫眉睫　土耳其決心禦侮　越保德軍向希土邊疾進　沿聖路瑪河流域建陣地</h3>
<p>倫敦　昨晚安加拉無綫電播音稱、德軍之佔領保加利亞、為戕賊小國自由之又一事件、並謂德國侵略巴爾幹之眞正理由、係德方各領袖已決定西方之勝利為不可能、故必須向其他方面試探、以期發見英國之有無隙罅可乘、軸心國之使戰事蔓延至巴爾幹半島、其唯一用意、即欲將大部份世界捲入漩渦、保人現或自信將可避免戰爭、但不久必將警悟、並發見其國家已成充滿恐怖之戰塲、土耳其之地位早已決定、土耳其人民現正以鎭靜態度默察時局、並深信彼等之領袖最近之活動、將不能使最後結果有絲毫改變云、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>安加拉　土耳其現注意由德軍佔領保加利亞而引起之局勢、極為密切、衆料土耳其不久將採取各種特殊防禦手段、以保障其利益、土外長薩拉卓格魯最近曾謂、保加利亞為土之鄰邦、似在土耳其安全區域之內云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>保京　據悉、淸晨灰色德國軍隊漫山遍野、通過保加利亞向馬其頓方面開進、大規模之巴爾幹戰爭、似已近在眉睫、先頭部隊聞已在保國邊境成立陣地、可由該處通過山地入希臘電、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>保京　德軍先鋒在保疾進、以加速央國與軸心國之決鬥、正値保國靜度其獨立紀念之際、據傳德機械化分遣隊已在保京以南及貼近希邊之聖路瑪河流域、建立前哨兵站、此間消息、一部分德軍正開至土邊、到達聖路瑪河流域若千地點之德軍、傳正建立作戰之陣地、該處離薩洛尼加不足六十哩、（八日國際電）</p>
<p>保京　德軍先頭部隊十一至十五師團、昨日由運輸汽車開過保加利亞、鞏固其前鋒在希保邊境之陣地六處、此等陣地之正確位置刻尙米悉、然據接近軸心者稱、謂係古拉達·達拉耶·巴瑪和·及能維戈、該方面吾認德軍已佔領希保邊境之維林格勒之消息、並謂德國目前不願作敵視土耳其之行動、（四日台衆電）</p>
<p>保京　保京昨日謠傳德軍已有二十師開入保國、其中十五師正向十國邊界進發、此等謠諑顯係納粹對土國神經戰之一部份、此間軍事專家謂如此龐大之軍隊、依理為不可能、因德方所獲保境三條公路、米能在此時期中運過十五師大軍也、且德國十五師亦不能遽即佈防於保國陸軍未曾駐紮之土國邊陲、軍事專家以為德軍五師開往邊界、或屬可能、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　據海通社接獲目睹德軍開入保加利亞之人士之電話、略稱、德軍先鋒於西北風中、開入保國、道路結凍、而車輛不絕前進、損毀之車輛均由修理隊隨時修理、德軍通過山區備嘗艱苦云、（四日海通電）</p>
<p>保允德軍入境　蘇聯嚴辭譴責</p>
<p>莫期科　蘇聯人民外交委員會副委長維許尼斯基昨以下項答覆交保加里亞駐蘇公使史丹米諾夫、「三月一日保加里亞外部代表亞爾第諾夫向蘇聯駐保公使聲明、保政府確已同意德軍開入保境、並謂此舉目的、係保障巴爾幹之和平、關於此事、蘇政府認為有作如下答復之必耍、（一）保政府自認其所採取之立塲、係屬正確、對於此項意見、蘇聯政府並不贊同、無論保政府之眞意何在、此種立塲決不能鞏固和平、相反的、保政府所採取之立塲、將使戰事擴大、而保加里亞本身被牽入戰禍、（二）根據此點、蘇聯政府為維持其和平政策、對於保政府實施上項政策、「不能予以任何援助、最近保加里亞報紙大造謠言、根本曲解蘇聯之眞正立塲、因此蘇聯政府不得不作上述之聲明」、（四日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　若干方面解釋蘇聯對於德軍入保之宜言、為勿干預土耳其及韃靼尼爾之可能的警吿、惟惟息靈通方面對於德軍衝入希臘、是吾將積極干預、表示懷疑、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　蘇聯譴責保加利亞行動之消息、因到達過遲、各報多不及評論、但「每日電聞」報載稱、此項消息土耳其方面必須認之為其東北邊陲安全之重要保證、巴特華特氏亦在新聞紀事報發表議論、謂蘇聯之宣言、或係意在警吿德國、惟亦或為蘇官方未能支持保加利亞之飾辭、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間外交界今日謂、蘇聯方在外交上作最大努力、使德軍在巴爾幹不向韃靼尼爾、而向西前進、此間政治觀察謂、據莫斯科方面傳來消息、蘇已因德估保國有潛在危險而受驚、蘇德間接衝地帶愈趨愈狹、蘇聯之神經亦愈敏、若干外交家以為蘇向保所提抗議、乃「蘇外交政策重要之改變」、又有外交家謂，此僅表面文章、以悅英美而已、英新聞協會外交記者今日以懷疑態度謂、「熱知巴爾幹局勢者、仍不信蘇之抗議、即其行動之前奏」據指稱、抗議係向保國提出、而非佔德國提出者、但倫敦多數政治許論家、一致以為雖有德蘇公約、蘇聯之抗議乃蘇聯不安之顯著反映、（四日國際社電）</p>
<p>携希特勒函件　德專使抵土京</p>
<p>斯丹埠　德國亨格爾轟炸機一架、載有携帶德國外交函件之專使一人到達此間、該專使立卽乘快車赴土京、（三日海通電社）</p>
<p>匈京　據此間接獲斯丹埠消息、携有希特勒致土耳其總統專函之使者、昨夜由德機載抵斯丹埠、據息、此函係欲向土國重行保證、德國在巴爾幹之和平意志云、（四日國際社電）</p>
<p>對保協定認已失效　土積極作軍師準備</p>
<p>紐約　據此間美國無綫電臺廣播消息、土京半官方面聲稱、保加利亞加入德義日三國同盟條約之後、德軍卽開入保境、因此土國認為土保兩國前此所成立之互不侵犯協定業已無效、緣以保國國內局勢而論、實已喪失獨立、土國自可不復認為尙受此項互不侵犯協定之束縛、德軍倘進攻希臘或土國本土、則土國唯有以武力週旋云、（三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>安加加　據未證實報吿英轟炸機曾往保加利亞之黑海港口伐爾那、又土耳其正式下令召集三級後備兵入役、同時令另三級兵士復員、官方否認韃靼尼爾海峽已佈置水雷之說、惟經過該處之船舶、必須由土國領港開駛、靈通方面相信、英外相艾登及參謀長狄爾必已與土國議定、如德國攻希、則英艦可有通過韃靼尼爾海峽之權、英陸空軍並可在土國取得根據地、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>斯丹埠　此間各報仍以保國附從軸心公約為主要論題、「凡丹報」稱、保國此舉為「巴爾幹被侵略之先聲、土國務須加倍警備」、「人民黨機關報」稱、保國久有加入該約之意、唯保國為奴之日期、直至目前始決定耳、其他各報皆謂保國旣簽訂土保不侵犯協定、乃墨瀋未乾、即取此最近行動、其理由何在、必須解釋、「烏勒期報」稱、土保協定重申保國對於鄰邦不藉武力解決問題之意嚮、但此點全視德義日與保國同盟所含義務如何實施為定、英土同盟已助使巴爾幹與中東保持和平、今尙希望保國運用其勢力而利用二國公約以保和乎云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　此間觀察家相信、蘇聯之牒文不過欲表示反對德方之舉動、並欲使軸心國注意蘇聯並一未放棄其巴爾幹之利益而已、衆料蘇聯在目下不致較、「紙上抗議」作更進一步之行動、（四日國際電）</p>
<p>納粹大軍壓境　旨在迫希求和</p>
<p>保京　此間希臘外交界稱、尙未聞德方向雅典施用外交壓力情事、大約納粹師團開至希臘邊界時、將開始施此壓力、開抵保京之德軍爲數尙甚微少、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約　德軍在巴爾幹最近舉動、已明顯表示希特勒運用最高度壓力、恫嚇希臘使向義大利乞和、保加利亞之加入軸心、德軍之雲集保境、當然引起新近喪失國家棟樑（總理梅泰薩斯）之希臘之極度恐慌、亟須從速決定和戰、觀察家均紛紛猜測梅泰薩斯之繼承人柯里齊斯在可怖之德國大軍壓境下、能吾繼承梅氏之事業、希臘現時需要者為堅强能幹之卓越人氏、以掌政府之國柄及維持戰鬬精神於不墮、然已往數星期、阿爾巴尼亞之希軍作戰已吿弛懈、此亦不可完全諉諸當道指揮之乏力、實因冬季之嚴寒凛烈、冰雪封沍、妨礙戰事者匪淺、同時義大利援軍大至、防務增强、但倘使天假之年、當時梅克薩斯並未將星隕落、則今日希軍殆已攻克代洛那突、梅氏不獨為一最高軍略家、且有領導全國之能力及堅强之意志、實為抗戰之棟樑、在今日巴爾幹情形下、希臘不獨須繼續以前之奮鬬精神、而國內尤應團結一致、梅氏生前政敵雖復不少、而因其人格偉大、尙無公然反抗、今日則德國正竭力設法破壞希臘之團結、煽動各反對派互鬬、此即德國使館仍保持於雅典之原因、因如此可作宣傳及外交活動也、此後不久或將再度勸誘希臘乞和、以前已試過二三次、在德人心中、當以為銀行家出身之總理、應較軍人出身之總理易於威迫利誘、但迄今尙未能成功耳、或者希臘之取舍、當視英美兩國所能接濟援助之量而定也、（四日合家電）</p>
<p>英希當局賡續談話　希具抗戰到底決心</p>
<p>雅典　英財相艾登與希臘當局談話、始於星期夜、至夜半後始止、今日午後將賡續晤談、英帝國軍參謀長狄爾將軍亦出席與議、衆料艾登與狄爾將在此盤桓數日、民衆歡迎極為熱烈、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>雅典　今日此門各晨報多發表評論稱、縱合巴爾幹事態之發展、而令局勢發生仟何困難及艱辛、希臘決將繼續戰鬥、觀察家均認報紙之評論、足以反映希臘全國人民之眞正情緒、若輩又稱、此種情緒且係反映新任總理柯里齊斯前星期六對美廣播所發表之意見、緣新總理於廣播中曾稱、希臘自四個月前戰爭爆發以來、卽猛戰不息、吾人之勝利將受全世界之慶祝、因此次勝利乃係公理克勝暴行之勝利也、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>德國威逼利誘　南國處境困難</p>
<p>南國京城　南斯拉夫攝政保祿親王昨在其斯羅文尼亞（南匈義交界點附近）私邸、接見德外長里賓特羅甫、此訊係從可靠方面探知者、並確悉保祿親王星期夜乘專車離南國京城北行、惟南國情報當局昨夜正式吾認保祿與里賓特羅甫會晤之說、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>南國京城　此間可靠方面今日稱、德國正要求南國發表利有於軸心之宣言、謂此舉非但足以保障該國之領土現狀、且可取得希軍重要軍港薩朗洛尼加，南國高級方面稱、南國殊有加入軸心之可能、惟此係數星期後之問題、而非數日內之問題云、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>南國京城　正當巴爾幹之德國大軍向南橫掃保國之際、納粹外交大砲已向南土兩國施放、其目的顯係欲使此項斯拉夫民挨、迅速投入軸心國之懷抱、並調和土國人士、南國現正處於繼續保守中立及加入軸心國陣綫兩難之間、其事更屬顯明、據可靠方面悉、德駐南大使希倫曾與克羅西亞獨立運動領袖會談、希氏已着手進行欲在南國之克羅西亞區、造成又一蘇台德區、又據稱、德已要求南國出而調停希義戰事、據此間外交界方面之意見、巴爾幹是吾將有戰事、以後數日間局勢展開時、即能分曉、（四日國際電）</p>

<h3>倫敦泰晤士報　論巴爾幹局勢　納粹軍閥今後行動　預料唯有三途可循</h3>
<p>倫敦　泰晤士報論巴爾幹方面之今後行動云、英外相艾登及英軍總參謀長狄爾將軍在安加拉時、已能證明土耳其矢忠對英同盟之堅決、並討論如何使同盟發生效力、以應付德方新威脅之手段與辦法、艾狄兩氏之訪問雅典、亦具有同樣目的、並有種種理山可預料此行之將獲得同等效果、德軍之侵保決不能以此為止、納粹軍閥似有三途可循、即或將進攻南斯拉夫希臘或土耳其是、數年前南斯拉夫雖曾一度採取傾向德國之政策以對抗義大利、但德國始終未博得南國人民之歡心、况南國人民天性上不為恫嚇所屈服、參加軸心將成為最不受歡迎之行動、貝爾格萊特方面已竭力吾認有採取此種途徑之任何意嚮、但南國之軍略地位、現已完全受軸心之包圍、並有德軍臨共與保加利亞之邊境、殊覺極端國難、外傳納粹軍隊已集中希調邊境外各地點之說、或為侵犯之開端、或為發最後通牒前之初步示威、均不可知、希軍聽參謀部及與之會商之英當局對於上述之種種可能性、自已熟加檢討、巴爾幹境內之地勢、無一處如波蘭或北法之一片平原、可供德國機械部隊之馳騁、天然障碍可予少數堅決守軍以莫大之帮助、各希軍在阿爾巴尼亞之表現、儘量利用山陵之形勢、但英方在陸地允其為空中之援助、亦在所必需、此種援助自將儘量給予、現在雅典進行之談話、無疑對此已有詳細之討論、至於土耳其何時可將其偉大之資源供最有利之運用、在此次土政府及參謀部與英國兩貴賓之長時間談話中、已有澈底之商討、須知土耳其對於德國所加於希臘之打擊、皆不能毫無影響也、英國因冬季戰事之勢如破竹、及埃及英方根據地安全之危脅已經消除、現時必須聯合其近東兩同盟國家、共同準備以應付希特勒最近演詞中所預示之春季攻勢云、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>維希　本日探悉法政府希望日本在調停計劃中規定保護割讓地中之法人及越南人、東京方面傳來之官方消息稱、日外相向法大使現在商討最後協定之措辭、日方將以該最後協定致送維希及盤谷、官方消息稱、法方會要求在最後協定內、規定割讓地中之法人及土著之地位、法政府已接受日方之調停辦法、以為解決泰越邊界爭端之根據、據信法政府欲使割讓地內之法越人民可將家財遷至法國地帶、但此辦法、涉及法人及越人所有之橡皮種植、據信、法政府欲確保泰政府將補償此輩橡皮種植者云（四日合衆社）</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（七）　英法聯軍　戰爭初期的失着</h3>
<p>關於法國戰敗的痛史，歐美各國雜誌書報的紀載，一時風起雲湧，至今未息，其中法國文學家莫樂所著法蘭西的大悲劇一書，堪稱傑作，並已由本報譯出，絡續發表，茲尚餘一篇，因譯稿擁擠之故，延攔至今始得揭戰如下，俾讀者得窺全豹：</p>
<p>一九三九年十月初，第一批英軍剛纔開到法國之後，我就被邀請到英軍總司令部任聯絡員，準備隨着戰事的進展，用著作演講和無綫電播昔等各種方法，維繫英國軍隊和法國平民間的接觸。</p>
<p>上次世界大戰時，我也曾在英軍中仟聯絡員，駕輕就熟，當然喜不自勝。我穿着中尉（這是我一九一八年的軍職）制服，往阿拉斯謁見英軍總司令戈特子爵。</p>
<p>這時戈特將軍駐節在阿拉斯附近哈巴克堡。我由兩個副官接待。一位是蘇格蘭軍官戈登，一表堂堂，穿着格子絨的蘇格蘭褲，一把鑲着銀柄光彩奪目的短劍，揷在有綫條的長統襪內。另一位是和藹可親的蒙間透爵士，是英王威廉四世非正式結合的後裔。他們在一問小室中招待我，請我飲一種烈性啤酒，酒味與衆不同，他們喚做「哈巴克的恐怖」，我領情了以後，他們就引導我去見總司令。</p>
<p>總司令部辦公室的簡陋，眞是生平所未見。門上用四隻圖畫釘，釘着一張卡片，上面字跡潦草，寫着「總司令行營」室中一無陳設，兩隻白木櫈子，擱上一塊木板，就算是總司令的辦公桌。戈特子爵相信，統兵將領須和士卒同甘苦，所以這樣的因陋就簡。他天性好動，但在道戰爭時期，祇有以散步爲唯一消遣。天方黎明，他就在阿拉斯四周泥濘的道路上行走，兩肘緊靠身旁，直着豚子，大踏步向前，頭上數着金打色軍帽，把雨點完全擋住，後面一個副官，氣喘如牛地緊隨着。</p>
<p>戈登吿訴我說，有一天總司令帶他向往克利洪旅館，和甘茂林將軍開軍事會議。他滿想可以到巴黎暢遊一宵，很是高興。不料吃過夜飯，戈特便對他說「現在我們可以去散步一會　。」</p>
<p>他兩肘緊貼身體，直着脖子向前，足不停步，繞羅佛宮兜了三個圈子，再跑回睡覺，戈登則在後面垂頭喪氣跟着。</p>
<p>我與戈特尚是第一次會面，見他那副靑年氣概，活潑有生氣，使我非常感動。英國陸軍大臣倍立厦，已使英軍司令部面目一新，朝氣蓬勃，着實不錯。我們談話很迅速，也很從容，戈特子爵先談希特勒的計劃。</p>
<p>戈特將軍說道，「希特勒會假道比利時嗎？我想是會的，因爲這是德國惟一進兵的路綫呀。你總記得福煦將軍「戰爭之時，當不顧一切，能做即做，能用即用一的名言。可是法蘭特區域在冬季泥濘遍地，我想希特勒是不會在此時進攻的。假使幾個月一無動靜，恐怕我們的軍心就要懈怠了。」</p>
<p>我說，「一九一四年中，我們也曾終日躱在戰壕呢。」</p>
<p>一那是時勢不同，不能執一而論。當時我們身臨大敵，自然不能輕懈。現在却守着列黎和杜華之前的一道防綫。」（說到道裹，他突的站起來把地圖上那條防錢指給我看。）「在我們前面，祇有一個中立的比利時。照此情形，要維持軍隊的戰鬥精神，可不是容易的事吧！假使像道樣拖延下去，非設法轉移他們的注意不可。」</p>
<p>他又說道，「你要多把法軍情形，告訴英軍，也要多把英軍的情形，轉達法軍。我們也要使各部隊常有彼此會見的機會，你們第七軍駐在英軍左翼，我自己也常拜訪他們的司令吉勞特將軍。他眞不愧是一員虎將。」</p>
<p>戈特將軍在戰爭時，一向把無用之物完全拋棄，這是他的原則，所以連捲烟灰盤也沒有一個。</p>
<p>第二天我開始視察前綫。正如戈特將軍所說，在防錢前面，除却關卡和比利時警察之外，別無所見。但是德軍一旦侵比，這一帶就將成爲戰塲了。防錢這樣的脆弱，使我不禁爲之胆寒。</p>
<p>一九三九年十月，列黎前綫的情形又怎樣呢？四周圍着鐵絲網的鋼骨水泥小碉堡，星羅棋布，相隔一二公里，每座碉堡裹面都有英軍駐守。每座碉堡有一架潛望鏡，俯視戰塲，又有一架機關槍和一架白倫式輕機關槍。此外雖聽說尚有一尊平射砲，其實祗有砲座，砲海沒有運到哩。</p>
<p>一條防禦戰車的塹壕蜿蜒其間，掘得不深，而且尚未完工。再向後面，則一羣英國兵士，正忙着挖掘壕溝和掩蔽所。但在每年此季，法蘭特一帶總是泥濘沒脛，這種工作，不免徒勞無功。他們掘不到幾尺深，便有一股水從地底湧出。他們異想天開，把木板數以草泥，想擋住那無孔不入的泉源。結果自然使人失望。</p>
<p>某記者問着，「這就是我們的防綫嗎？眞是天曉得！現在的攻擊力量，比一九一四年要利害十倍，我們的防禦工程却反比一九一四年减弱了十倍！」</p>
<p>許多新聞記者的忠實報道，都被嚴厲的檢查處扣留。他們出於無奈，只好把焦慮收起，一味敷衍民衆。但是據守這條防錢的軍官，却儘力裝出不必悲觀的樣子，一個軍官把部下艱苦掘成的一條壕溝指給我看，用解嘲的口吻說道，「這條壕溝，顯然一輛戰車也阻止不住。但是前面究竟還有一座森林，我們儘可希望敵軍的戰車，不會從這條路來呀！」</p>
<p>可是以後數星期中，英法的軍事專家已着手廣泛的防禦工事。防綫之後，無數工人胼手胝足，努力初築鋼骨水泥的新工事。戰塲上到處可見鋼骨矗立，做新碉堡的輪廓，附近還有英國派來的水門汀專家，把泥沙石子混合成三和土。在法軍防區，新碉堡的僞裝非常巧妙，多像平常房屋一般，總司令部深爲滿意。</p>
<p>這時法軍中人多在閱讀沙維尼將軍所著「侵略還可能嗎」一書。這位將軍是陸軍大學的敎授，他得着一個結論說，鋼骨水泥碉堡，已使侵略絕對不成問題。道種工事可以迅速築成，甚至敵人佔領第一道防錢時，守軍已能築成第二道防錢了。可惜他完全忽略了兩件事實：第一，攻擊鋼骨水泥的砲臺，或者尚有新的方法；第二，敵軍突破一點，就可抄到鋼骨水泥防錢的背後。其實，英法軍隊冒着嚴寒雨雪，在整個隆冬辛苦築成的這條防綫，從未受到敵軍正面的攻擊。</p>
<p>非但如此，多數軍事專家一致誤認德軍攻擊比利時是不會有的事。今日的比軍，實力雄厚，配備精良，德國又何苦要爲淵敺魚，增一勁敵呢？他們又深信馬奇諾防綫有金湯之固，因此希特勒祇有了兩條進兵的路綫，一從荷蘭，一從羅馬尼亞，但是荷蘭的洛特丹，是德國最後的呼吸器官，羅馬尼亞又早已把她剩餘的汽油輸往德國所以這兩條路，都是走不通的。他們的結論都說，德國在今夏勢將無所舉動，時間可於我們有利，至一九四一年，我們即可獲得制空權，至一九四二年，我們即可有很多的戰車重砲，足以摧毀德國的齊格飛防錢了。這種見解，在那時到處流露，前錢每次聚餐，都以此作爲談助，我自己也有這種錯覺。</p>

<p>洋米抬價操縱、昨日更爲肆無忌憚、櫻花司原包小絞現貨限九十二元、昨竟加貼價一千元成交一百噸、即每包貼十元、爲一百零二元也其他現洋米貼五六六元七八元者、已成秘密公開、限價云云、已被若輩奸商破壞無遺、而當局視若無睹矣、但洋米棧存八十多萬包外、新到源源不絕私人秘密囤積儲蓄者數亦不少、故公開調查與勒限出售之舉、似不能再緩矣、新交易成交三四月碎米一千噸、價九十六元、合義拋出、建源討九十七元、在電洽中、其他亦有多起在接洽、但進口商亦趁此混亂局勢、宜稱水脚增高、而喊高其定價、此抬彼扳、必令民無食始已也、</p>
<p>米於市上經囤戶拉住不出、已同死市仍祗香港糯一項稍有出售、然價格繼續飛漲二三元、開自九十五元次至九十三元、餘惟厚薄粳國米而已、但以一般店舖感夫洋米難購、遂都改採國米、致銷塲突旺、來源旣寥、貨主居奇之下、行情突飛猛進、升高三四元之巨、開常幫斛白粳百十五元、崑山斛粳一百十二三元、靑角薄稻斛見特自百零九元半、次至百零七元半、</p>

<p>小麥　昨日市况、依然堅俏內地杜麥、堪稱來源告絕、洋麥雖有運到、新到又有二萬包、供給粉廠尚感不足、聞租界存棧麥喊價頻昂、竟達四十五元之叫盤、日廠門市收價、亦在暗放、但亦無貨可收、故市面暗俏益盛、</p>

<h3>保財妙法</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>遠在去年筆者爲本報寫金融述評時、鑒於遠東局勢的嚴重和在外匯市塲上投機的不智，因而勸告一般資余所有者從速將資金內移。並鼓勵購買金公債。在當時筆者雖然言之諄諄，而資金所有者則聽之藐藐，事實　於雄辯，南太平洋上的局勢是一天緊張一天，美日戰爭隨時有爆發的可能，上海租界也隨時有被日本佔領的可能，一般資金所有者終於被火藥臭味所驚覺，對於暫時託庇於租界的安全性開始恐慌起來，不知究竟如何處置資金才是保財的唯一妙法－存儲外滙？購藏黃金？囤積貨物？可是外匯有被凍結的危險，黃金的現貨籌碼太少，貨物有被沒收的可能。</p>
<p>資金固然是向安全地帶流動。但是資金流到安全地帶還不是絕對的安全，一勞永逸的安全，僅是相對的安全，暫時無碍的安金。資金絕對的安全是建立在國家權力能加以保護的基礎之上，從沒有脫離國家權力所能保護的資金是安全無碍的，雖然資金是在安全地帶存留着，這雖然是理論，但同時也是事實：目今上海一般資金保有者所惴惴不安的形態便是這理論的反映。</p>
<p>上海實在不是資金存留的絕對安全地帶，但是叨中國政府的金融勢力和英美對中國政府的友善關係，資金在此存留是相對的安全了很久，可是目今的相對安全，隨時有變爲絕對的危險。南太平洋上的戰爭一日不爆發，則因中國的金融勢力和英美對華友善關係底存在，一日不危險。然而誰也不能保證明日的南太平洋上的戰爭不發生，那末誰也不能保證在上海的資金不趁機預爲佈置是不危險。在事實上南太平洋上的戰爭一旦爆發，那時日本一定要估領租界，中國的金融勢力也撤退了，英美對中國的友善關係也撤退了，目今資金藉以相對的安全的因素是不再存在了。</p>
<p>那末如何處置資金才是保財的唯一妙法呢？</p>
<p>中國政府對於當前的危急情形，雖然沒有公佈什麼保全資金的妙法，但在過去早已開闢好幾條投放資金的康莊大道。不幸這些辦法不但是被一般資金所有者所返忘，恐怕從來就沒有認識過，筆者用將這幾種投放資金的情形介紹如後：（未完）</p>
<h3>證券　債市漲跌均難</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况仍未脫盤旋狀態、上午稍小、下午又稍稍回好、欲漲不易、欲跌更難似此一再醞釀、顯係空頭過於擁擠之故、前途因空方壁壘愈築愈高、誠恐難免再蹈去年漲風之覆轍、不過日期問題而已、昨日交易、信孚仍在不斷買進、爲期已將旬日、以上逢低吸收、絕不抬價、爲力之雄厚、可以想見作用如何、固不可知、而未來之變化、即在其中矣、餘如順昌聯和鼎康等亦均買進居多、惟同康則始終賣出、已經多日、餘則忽進忽出、並無一貫作用者、則殊不乏人、大都候機觀變、待時而動而已、昨日市價結果、僅甲種微好一角、丁種因較與上月二十六日比較、故獨小八角、丙戊種做小一角左右、乙種不動、成交總數的一百四五十萬兀、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股、價爲十九元正、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市爲謠所挫　多空不易捉摸</h3>
<p>紗市飄忽無定、皆以謠言紛紜、以致投機者心神恍惚、因之市盤忽起忽降，殊難捉摸、就目前狀態測之、紗市前途仍在搖盪不定中、因爲看好存底則充斥、如果看壞、標金一升、外滙一縮、投機買戶立刻而來、目大家在多頭地位、能漲最樂、一鬨　高、但價格連二三日已上數十元、盈利者不乏出籠、籌碼一鬆、反動下墜亦速、所以目前紗市、猶如火鍋上的螞蟻也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百二十四元、低價爲一千三百八十六元·午後初做一千三百九十一元、漸後做至一千四百〇一元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、多頭一律出動、大家互相高抬、由一千四百〇六元、直升至一千四百二十四元、炭以獲利吐出、又復回至一千四百十一元、但新買者紛紜、又見上升、詎料已近十一時三刻外、聞外滙又有凍結之說、標金下落、一霎間紗市跌風忽起、且塲中在喊賣出聲、一時只聞叫賣聲、不見成交、直瀉至一千三百八十六元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千七百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉市淸凉如故</h3>
<p>現棉情况稍形堅穩、但實際消費求見發展也、所以棉市仍在徬徨之途中、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、同業皆取觀望之態、故市况平淡而無特色、結果較之上日收盤價格低落的二三磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因空頭抵補而漲、繼之投機售出、及棉商套賣回跌、結果昨日連同預測略漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、冷淡而無人過問、市價亦略見軟、如目下環境不能改善、則棉市前途良堪憂也，</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布廠盤　晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢不定、忽漲忽落、乃因同業投機心思旺盛、逢漲則進、逢跌即吐、市盤晨漲午跌、結果平平、富貴大鵬細布晨漲每疋五角、午後回跌五角、怡和粗布晨漲二角半之譜、午後亦復上日原盤、漂染布不動、散額手貨略有廉價轉售、本街成交各布四百餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布色斜等一百數十件、閩幫辦錢呢嗶嘰監布等五六十件、粵港幫辦士林布　布色斜府綢等一百數十件、又棉布今（五日）已有三百件、運往靑島、</p>
<p>東布　初平纔漲、收盤又回、結果牛穩、無大軒輊、十一磅龍頭細布爲四十八元六角、取行所本月期仍昂、收盤四十九元四角、四君子嗶嘰晨盤最高見一元三角四分、後市回跌至一元三角二分七五、</p>
<h3>春花呢最動銷</h3>

<h3>糖市　食糖繼漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市以進戶較多、致趨勢續向上游、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨本棧八十一元、外棧起伏不定、初爲八十元六角至八角、後回至六角至五角、結果升六角、三月十日打單八十元零九角至八角、二十日打單八十一元二角至八十一元、升七角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十二元五角、至三元、後復回至八十二元六角、計升一元六角、DY嘜東棧七十九元五角、升五角HX嘜西棧七十九元二角、</p>
<h3>雜項　肥皂繼漲增高</h3>

<h3>煤炭　同得利白煤　－好起十餘元－</h3>
<p>同得利白煤、月前因老棧單過多、囤　塞　、曾跌至二百三十二三元、無人接受、日來因越南風雲緊張、市塲又起利多傳說、日昨暗盛與明市相　、好起十餘元行情、公司掛牌、雖仍爲二百四十五元、棧單亦有限制、故本街門莊、亦已提高、送到客戶、篩塊每噸二百六十元云、</p>

<p>中英同盟　絕對否認</p>
<p>當寇爾爵士偕大使夫人下裕生輪跨上碼頭時、記者中尤以日籍爲多、紛紛爲之攝影，並以各種問題相詢、然大使則未予答復、並不肯發表共對中國戰時首都之一般局勢之意見、惟常記者詢以外傳中英計劃成立軍事同盟之說、是吾確實時、英大使稱、「此爲無稽之談、」並稱、渠旅途殊感愉快、</p>
<p>在滬勾留　爲期甚暫</p>
<p>據大使私人秘書麥更孜君（I．C．Mackenzle）談稱、與大使同行來滬者、僅大使夫人及本人二人、在途除在香港小憩外、未有躭擱、大使來滬目的、爲處理此間事務、並無其他任務、大使在滬、將有短時期之勾留、時間或爲一月、但以甫行抵埠、故尚未能決定、大使經常半年留渝、半年留滬、大使以去年八月離滬返渝、將屆半年、故而來滬、逕赴該處休息、但此次聞已決定改居終華懋飯店、</p>

<h3>工董會今日討論　核減電流辦法　根據電力公司所提方案　並協助獲取運煤斤船隻</h3>
<p>工部局所組織之研究當流供給問題委員會，特於昨日上午十一時、在工部局二樓會議室召集會議、討論電力公司所提出减少電流供給之計劃、及工部局如何援助電力公司獲得煤斤汽油運輸之船隻、而使電力得有充分之供給、至會議結果如何、須待今日下午四時半召開之工部局董事會討論後、方可決定、如果實行减電辦法、逐漸推行、俾本市工商界不致因而遭遇重大影響、聞華商及日商紗廠、已因此開始减工二成至五成不等、</p>
<p>正當用途　充分供給</p>
<p>據向上海電力公司探悉、該公司所貯煤觔、現能供給三個月之需、但如能獲得運輪上之便利、而得大量之煤觔、則電力之供給、可無短少之虞、該公司所需煤觔、大多來自華北及柬印度二地、今因運輸上發生困難、不得不作减供電流計劃、但深望市民能節省不必要之耗電、得使電流能充分供給正當用途、又據向某工業界探悉、電力公司果煤觔來源缺乏而减供電流、則一部份工廠、將因此而受影響、但一部份以電熱工作之工廠尚可改用自來火、但費用較爲昂貴、</p>
<p>本市存油　足敷數月</p>
<p>字林西報云、關於上海之汽油有缺乏之可能一事、據美孚火油公司某職員昨日（三日）語記者、該公司對於任何油類、不擬限定額量、渠承認目下本埠缺乏機油（即柴油）、並不能說明何時海外將續有述到、昨日汽油可能缺乏之恐慌、使木埠一般汽車行及遝輸公司大量購進、但據調查所得、本埠所存汽油、尙足敷數月之用、據另一方面消息、所謂汽油可能缺乏一節、乃係投機家所發之謠言、希圖藉此抬高油價、以遂其囤積牟利心願、機油之缺乏、爲時過久、確將使本埠運輸事業遭受打擊、但若干方面相信、三月底將有新貨可到、</p>
<p>工業界注　視核减量</p>
<p>據工部局工業社會處二月份報告稱、上月末週、上海電力公司曾宣布核减電流供給之可能性、詳細辦法、雖尚未正式公布、但此事已引起工業界之注意、據某某數家工廠表示、倘電流供給額核减不多、渠等尚能應付、萬一遽予大量减少、則不無困難耳、各工廠如玻璃廠。熱水瓶廠·燈泡廠·輾銅廠等、使用柴油者、預料將因缺乏油料之供給而感受困難、至若利用蒸汽之廠等、亦在顧慮燃料短絀之虞、有廠房卅所、在昔作爲絲廠者、現因缺乏厚利、已改作堆棧·鐵工廠·紡績廠·及色染廠矣、</p>
<p>煤斤現貨　已被操縱</p>
<p>滬市因大宗煤斤被操縱、以致市塲現貨籌碼驟减、人心堅挺、昨日煤斤市價、竟被做高、近以上海電力公司因存煤短缺、擬將每日電力供應較諸過去减低、故一般利令智昏者、乘機蠢動、把持大宗囤貨、殊屬非是、今煤球市價、每担（一百市斤）已有售九元者、中下階級平民生活將愈感窘迫、據煤業界透露消息、裝日商Mitiren　Maru輪於昨日上午七時運抵大宗鴻基煤屑、據悉該項煤屑、係兩大煤球廠所訂、備市上應用者、望及早售淸、以平市價、</p>
<p>馬達電力　已受限制</p>
<p>工部局頃發布告、略稱、茲因燃料短絀、到貨困難、自即日起、迄另發通告之日爲止、所有請求接用馬達電力、無論爲新裝抑或擴充、上海電力公司將一律不予接受、本局對於此事業予同意矣、</p>

<h3>伍德海之南京印象</h3>
<p>評論家英人伍德海，在其主編之東方時事月報上刊登南京遊記一篇，內云：著者於一九四〇年三月間，曾往南京一行，今年二月初，因休息及銷假之暇，重作南京之遊。乘車之先，須由日軍部核准，每人繳相片二張，雖不收費，但須塡寫冗長之塡表二份，至少五日之久，甚爲不便。此層實係日人並不歡迎外人在南京居留過久，余曾請求旅居三個月，而日方只准予住十日。</p>
<p>今日之南京，與十一月以前之南京無甚改觀，中山路較前略有修埋，但仍足震壞汽車之輪簧。各小街上則礮彈痕及炸彈巨穴，比比皆是，須繞道而行。政府官署之屋宇，仍有數所在斷坩頹壁中。城門檢查綦嚴，除嚴格之搜查外，中國人及日本平民，必須一律下車，脫帽向日守兵致敬。步行過城洞後，始得再登軍。英美政府，曾一再向日當局明白表示，必不能容忍英美人民之向日守兵行禮，但此事在南京仍爲對日磨擦原因之一，日哨兵且曾迫令英美高級海軍人員下車步行人城。手續最煩者，爲下關之城門，該處因有和記廠房，外人進出頻繁，極感不便。發生磨擦最多者，爲外人進出以赴高爾夫球塲之城門。</p>
<p>由京今日之外觀，已完全成爲一日軍之衛戍營，較一九四〇年三月間什遊時允甚。在街中無時無處不見日兵日海軍日旗及日本軍用汽車，重要房屋，均有日兵把守，大房產多被日軍圈用。外商在寗，已無營業可言，較大之廠，仍留最低限度之職員數人，以看管利益。汀邊之外商產業、仍在日軍佔領之下，現時一息僅存之外商貿易，厥爲少量之煤油及紙烟。南京市內麵粉，糖，火柴，牛油，煤等日用品奇缺，電燈，電話，自來水等費，均須用軍用票交付。城內野山鷄甚多，故准人民射擊。南京已失從前敎育中心之地位，各大學僅留中西職員數人看守房屋而已。</p>
<p>作者曾與一日軍談稱，南京之外表，甚似一日軍之衛戍營，該軍官謂，維持治安之軍隊，方在訓練中，日本駐屯「不久」可以撤退云，但著者目睹日軍之圈用房地產，及圖佔外人產業等事，絕不似爲作短期勾留之形象。</p>
<p>日軍正式聲明開放南京以下之長江，巳逾一年於茲，迄無實行之意今日能駛過南京之外船，僅有長江中之美國砲艦。大的每月往來於上海·蕪湖。一次，中間經過鎭江·南京·至駛往漢口之美砲艦，的每三個月一次，須由日艦偕行「保護」。各方均驚奇爲何外人往南京遊歷者不甚踴躍，實則倘使手續不如此繁重者，外人或不至如此裹足。余所領者除准照外，尚須有防霍亂證書，牛痘證書等繁重手續，故今日之南京，雖有山川風景之淸秀，不能引起外人興趣也。</p>

<h3>肉食者鄙</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>肉食者何鄙，實在有點兒「莫明其妙」，可是以情推本，或為「殺生」故耳。</p>
<p>當然，這「肉」專指：豬，牛，羊……決不是人！</p>
<p>但現在竟也有了「食人者」。非但有，不僅有，並且多得很。</p>
<p>狗吃糞吃慣了，而不覺糞之臭；人「吃人」吃久了，也不覺「吃人者」之在「吃人」；這是頗合「自然」原則的……</p>
<p>『若要人不知，除非己莫為。』「吃人」儘管「自然」，「血腥氣」和「吃剩的骨頭」到底還很容易被別人發見而起來反抗的。呼籲抑低米價，請求制裁囤商，便是鐵證！（雖然呼籲請求的結果也許是『只聞樓梯響，不見人下來』）</p>
<p>因此，「肉食者」豈止「鄙」而已哉！</p>
<h3>別再上「人上人」的當</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>『吃得苦中苦，方為人上人。』</p>
<p>這句俗話，往往是一般忠厚長者。勸那些心頭好動的毛頭小伕子的老成話。但是，有些時候却成了一般人自己安慰自己的「靈藥」。於是把這裏邊所包含着的「蹊蹺毛裏病」，全都給忽視了。</p>
<p>我想，一定有人要問，這明明是一句「金玉良言」，你這人怎麽可以信口胡說，而推翻古人的訓條呢？』不錯，這是「古訓」，但是，古訓難道就絕對不會有錯誤的嗎？我相信，這問題，恐怕沒有一個人敢回答一聲，這是「絕對」不會有錯的。</p>
<p>那末，既然有錯，我們就得在此中找出錯的根由來，而再不能讓它像沒有發覺以前似的繼續錯下去，甚至一直保守着緘默而不作一聲。因為過去我們，自己已經受了欺騙，所以一定得把其中的秘密告訴別人，而使他們能覺悟過來，去為真正做一個人而奮鬥。</p>
<p>首先，我們得指出，『吃得苦中苦，方為人上人』這句「金玉良言」是句不折不扣的自欺欺人之談，和叫人只知「安分守己」，「聽天由命」的「鬼話」，而把人們的進取思想，一筆勾銷了。而多少年來的社會，也就在這兩句話之下，被封建制度統治着，而使成千纍萬的痛苦者不得翻身；同時，也就不想翻身。這真跟拿「命運論」來欺騙人們的手段是如出一轍的。</p>
<p>不過，事情却不是這樣簡單，宿命論者告訴你，你自己的「命」苦，就該一生一世的苦下去，不要再想這個，想那個了。這樣，倒是挺乾脆的把你註定了得永世做奴隸。可是『吃得苦中苦，方為人上人』，那就更進一步了，你現在不妨先做做奴隸，將來是好翻身，但翻身的條件就是你眼前必須先做牛馬，否則，將來也就休想做什麽『人上人』！於是，多少人都給騙得服服貼貼，甚至連做得像牛馬一樣地死去都甘心情願，而沒有一句怨言。</p>
<p>可是，我們的受騙者，似乎也太忠厚了一點。你看：被剝削的朋友，今天是在做人「下」人，有着「人上人」高高居上；不過，要是一旦人下人也給爬到了人上人的地位（但究竟是少數中的少數），那末，在自己身下的，還是有着無數的大眾，所不同的，祇是你自己一個人的高昇而已。</p>
<p>但是，不幸得很，慘劇的展開，也就在這一個根由上面：因為有着人上人，也同時存在着人下人，於是人人都想做人上人，因此人下人都拼命地想往上爬，頂，攻，結果，就鬧成了人下人與人上人的鬬爭，這樣，就像今天的整個社會，整個世界，整個人類，也就永遠的被絞在這漩渦裏得不到安寗或靜止的時候。</p>
<p>所以，我們要呼籲，我們不願意做人下人，但同時也絕對不想做人上人而希望是，這世界上的人，一律在平等互惠的原則下，做　個彼此不分上下的人！而我們今天的工作，也就應該在澈底改造現在這種人上頭有人，甚至存着十幾層人上人的社會制度而努力！</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 綠沙作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「有辦法了！」他從三十多級的樓梯上奔上來，氣急得像一頭才耕過三畝田的老牛一樣。「咱們就去見見袁太太再說！」</p>
<p>他把一條肥手拉住了秋海棠，大有立刻要秋海棠走的意思。</p>
<p>「可是袁鎮守使也在這裏嗎？」秋海棠不大就敢相信地問。</p>
<p>「三爺在不在倒沒有關係，」趙四把一頂已經破了的黑呢帽，揪住左手裏，當一柄扇子似的扇着，而他的肥險上，也的確累得已經在流汗了。「這裏的胡太太跟督軍馬廳長的內眷都有往來，你只要去見一見她便行了！」</p>
<p>秋海棠聽他說得似乎很有理，而方才也的確已給那些光棍們擾得有些昏亂了，便不暇再顧其他，真的就站起來，跟着趙四便走；直至找到了袁寶藩的金屋，在門口遇上袁寶藩最親信的一個馬弁季兆雄之後，才覺得自己來得太冒昧了。</p>
<p>「啊！這件事怕有些難辦。」季兆雄先把秋海棠和趙四兩個人讓進了會客室去，聽他們把此來的目的講了一遍，然後皺皺三角眉，從他那一對凹得很深的眼眶裏，發出兩道怪尖銳的光芒來，打秋海棠的臉上轉了幾轉，同時慢吞吞說：「這裏的太太不是和你從沒有見過嗎？吳老板……。不過，打聽倒真虧你們打聽得到的！」</p>
<p>「是我跑了一個上半天才打聽到的。」趙四彷彿很得意地說：「現在既然來了，好歹請老兄給我們去說說看！」</p>
<p>季兆雄的臉上，還是透出了很為難的神氣「你們那裏知道！這位太太的脾氣，真和京裏的三位大不相同呢！」他壓低了聲音，故意裝得很機密似的說：「鎮守使見了她也有幾分害怕。而且她最悵的就是唱戲的人，從前鎮守使在京裏，不是天天請了你們許多好角兒，到家裏來大唱大喝的嗎？可是在這兒就不行！不相干人，他老人家簡直不敢再帶進來。……」</p>
<p>他的話還沒有說完，秋海棠差不多就要失望得走了。</p>
<p>「但是，我們老板跟三爺和七爺的交情，多少和別人不同一些，裏面也應該知道吧！」趙四却還不肯放棄這一條門路。「請大哥幫個忙，進去試試行不行？」</p>
<p>這馬弁還是搖頭。　（四六）</p>
<h3>一天的日記</h3>
<p>— 失業者</p>
<p>很早就起了身，看見媽已在昏暗的灶角邊摺箔了。她那張削瘦的臉上，蒙着無盡的愁色，我知道：家裏是再也沒有飯能給我吃了。</p>
<p>開水亦沒有下一點肚，就挾着幾本投考指南，歷屆試題跑出了家門。</p>
<p>幸而身上還有一件破而髒的藍布長衫穿着，並趁那管理員在整理雜誌的時候，給我混進了×年會的閱覽室。</p>
<p>翻閱報架上的報紙，還不見寄出已十天的一篇「飢餓」刋登出來，這使我萬分憂愁和忿怒；腦海裏隨即意識到哈姆生做的那一本書裏，說着這樣的一段話：「編輯處那隻張着龍口的大字紙簍，好像連人骨頭都吞得下去似的！」</p>
<p>剛坐停還看不上三而書，飢餓的光芒，已開始湧擠到眼球裏來。它使我失去了識別那書本上每一字句的能力，抬起頭來，突然見到映在對面大玻璃上的臉像，竟使我跳了起來。祇不過是半個月的失業，已使我的雙頰凹進，兩眼深陷，菜色而鐵青的臉上，披着散亂的枯髪。</p>
<p>我是再也沒有忍耐的勇氣，去坐在那裏讀書了；便急促地退了出來。當我那無力的手臂去推扇彈黃門時，管理員的銳利的眼光，直向我身上掃了過來，釘住在腋下的幾本書上。這我倒並不怕，怕的却是他來向我要「會員證」。</p>
<p>飢餓的驅迫，使我再也想不到「面子」這二字，這時，我恍惚已走到南京路的一家綢緞局前，去找我的叔父。</p>
<p>雖然蒙着他的同情，答應借我一塊錢，但是當他進去拿錢的時候，「高鼻子」的皮鞋脚送了過來。我是經不起他的再演的，當然只得走，錢借不到而吃「外國火腿」，那你去怪誰呢？</p>
<p>低着頭，在一條弄子裏撫摸着創痛，看見一張五分幣票，從一個孩子的衣袋裏落了出來。這時我並不知道什麽叫「誠實」和「廉恥」，敏捷地伸過手去拾了起來，再愉快的溜了出來。</p>
<p>在一個攤子上，我把這五分錢，買了一塊燒餅送進嘴裏，雖然是乾而硬的東西，但是被口液的潤濕，隨即變成一個「食球」在嘴裏打滾，發出津津的甜味。我想着：三十五塊錢一客大菜，在那些終日飽暖的富人嘴裏，決不曾有這樣的美味吧？我得意而驕傲起來，緊扼着咽頭細細地咀嚼，希望這「食球」永久的存在，可是一刻兒，嘴裏又空了起來，</p>
<p>回到家裏，媽還是坐在那昏暗的灶角邊，摺着從錫箔店裏取來的紙錠。看那紅腫的雙眼，知道她已哭泣過了。我脫下身上那件「獨一無二」的藍布長衫，遞給她說：「媽，別再傷心啦，過幾天郵務員給我考取了，不是我們可以過活了嗎？這衣服去當了，買些米，來煮些粥喝喝吧。」</p>

<h3>談劉硯亭</h3>
<p>— 澹然</p>
<p>南北談名淨者，僅知有郝金侯李，獨於劉硯亭，隻字不提，余甚惑焉。郝除嗓音宏實，練字有勁以　，唱腔，臉譜，身段，皆不趨大路。少山嗓子雄厚，臺風偉梧，但唱腔，身上之隨　，為其一大缺點。倨喜　無嗓，身材又瘦小，僅持神氣作派，亦非花臉全材。李春恒嗓音充實，銅鎚架子皆宜，「盜御馬」「忠孝全」「普球山」「打龍袍」等劇，不在郝金侯以下，近十年來，力學郝壽臣，狠勁頗有似處，但地位反因此降落。李年與郝等不相上下，又不能置於孫盛文袁世海裘盛戎王泉奎之間，上不能與郝金侯並提，下又不得列入後輩花臉隊中，李春恒三字以是反不為外行所注意矣。</p>
<p>劉硯亭為楊小樓之愛婿劉硯芳之兄，久依小樓。小樓班中之武淨原有錢金福，故硯亭在班中為二路武淨；且錢金福以下，尚有一許蔭棠之子許德義，劉在楊班地位在許德義下，故有時兼演二路架子戲，私淑黃潤甫金秀山甚力，「落馬湖」關泰，「連環套」大頭目，必由硯亭演之。楊小樓貼「長板坡」，張飛錢金福，曹洪許德義，派硯亭扮張邻。小樓末次出來，因錢金福年老未與，乃由劉硯亭替錢演唱：「落馬湖」之李佩，「長板坡」之張飛，「挑滑車」之金兀术，「鐵龍山」之司馬師，居然無遜於錢金福。全福無嗓，硯亭能唱，則此固勝於彼也。數年前郝壽臣因故辭班，凡郝之戲，楊小樓胥派硯亭演之，精彩不減壽臣。自郝卑回楊班，劉嘗隨譚富英奔走南北；「法門寺」之劉瑾，「定軍山」之夏候潤，「空城計」之馬謖，「羣英會」之黃蓋，「戰太平」之陳友諒，「摘纓會」之先蔑，「烏盆計」之包公，「八大鎚」之金兀术，「鎭濟州」之牛皋，「珠簾寨」周德威俱不弱；其中馬謖夏候潤二角，尤優為之，以視南方以此二角出名之程少餘似勝一籌也。曾見與李洪春合演「詩陽園」「古城會」（代訓弟）「下河東」，堪稱好戲。偶演「靑風寨」「取洛陽」亦卓然不凡。馮小隱君評劇，對於目下伶工，極少稱許，而於硯亭獨具雙眼，謂「看郝候之劇　看劉硯亭。」實以硯亭之藝，樸實無華，無驕揉做作之處，馮君之所以捨郝侯而取劉硯亭也。</p>

<h3>奮鬥的人生觀</h3>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第一章　人生何處不相逢</p>
<p>胡亂混了幾年，靠着弟兄們的出力，居然有吃有穿，逍遙度日。可是靜中捫心自問，天生俺這一具銅筋鐵肋，不能為國家仗劍立功，上馬殺賊，留一個靑史美名，却長此埋沒在這草澤中嗎？心裏未免有些不甘。後來逢到了一個江湖上相識的人，姓柴名英。他是到山海關吳三桂總兵部那裏去投軍的。他勸俺不必幹這綠林生活，不如棄暗歸正，也到官軍中去效力。俺就答應了他，留他在山上住了數天。他臨去時對俺說，他若投軍得收，當託人來送信給俺。果然他去了不到一年，便有一個人帶着他的一封信來，喚俺同去。因此俺散了夥，便下山登程，投奔吳將軍去。隨身衹帶着俺的两件寳物，一是門外拴着的那匹烏騅名馬，全身毛色純黑，蹄長耳圓，眞有日行千里夜行八百之能。此外還有一柄靈　寳刀，是魏晋間遺下的。張蒼虬說到這裏，將手一按腰間的刀柄，很得意的笑了一笑，然後接着說道：「今天俺路過這裏，正想向人家吿求一餐，却闻你書聲朗朗，讀得正是好聽，未免驚動你，打擾你了。但是方今之世，大亂將起，你在這裹閉戶讀書，即使讀好了，也有何用呢？俺還沒有請敎主人姓名，話已說多了，請你見吿吧。」</p>
<p>那少年聽了他的話，覺得他出言吐語，非常慷爽，不愧是風塵中的健兒。自己平時也很羨慕游俠，以為朱家郭解之徒，今世難得。今天逢着這位不速之客，大有虬鬆公一流人物的光景，且能放下屠刀，立志從軍，更是難能可貴。所以他非常高興，便說道：「鄙人姓許，單名一個靖字。世居於此杞縣城外。先父在時是個老秀才，終身未取功名，不得已灌　耕田，老死牗下。他易簀的當兒，曾再一囑我好好讀書，將來代他一吐抑塞之氣。無奈我不喜帖括之學，雖中了童子試，以後却數次名落孫山，幾乎把我的心全灰了。在此閉戶讀書，侍奉老母，侷促如轅下駒，壯士幸勿見笑。」（三）</p>
<h3>藝壇散記</h3>
<p>— 守無</p>
<p>新華公司最近本來有一個「閃電」計劃，仿照「聯華交響曲」前例，請各導演各明星合作來一部「國聯交響曲」，後經巨頭會議結果，決定改變原議，將此全副精力，用在「家」的攝製上。「家」由上海劇藝社演出至今，始終客滿，故新華些舉，頗有「生意眼」也。</p>
<p>璇宮劇院由趙志游以二萬　代價　下後，外聞有傳上海劇藝社將搬至璇宮演出，並將改為「中國藝術劇院」名議。茲據探悉，此說本來有七分可靠，現在則已成為過去。</p>
<p>香港新生公司司徒慰敏導演之「祖國之戀」，本月中才能開始，現在招考男女演員中。望文生義，該片為寫僑胞生活者，故外景或將遠征爪哇或菲列濱攝製。</p>
<p>民華之「古中國之歌」，昨日拍「水淹七軍」，瑞德寳演關公，梁連柱演周倉，實為不可多得之搭配。瑞之關公戲曾為淸庭供奉，其藝之精，可想而見，而此後則將「供奉」與大衆共賞矣。至梁連柱為富連成班之老前輩，上海之淨行中，算起人頭來，更少不了他一個，無怪聞風來參觀抬戲者，為數殊衆，都為欣賞劇藝而來。</p>
<h3>影城動態</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>「蝴蝶夢」的英籍名導演歐佛希區考在努力完成又一力作「斯密士夫婦」，他曾在二百二十五個女郎中尋覓一個適合該片的女主演員，但是仍使他失望。於是他大發牢騷說：「在全好萊塢中沒有一個美麗的女子。」這眞是影城奇談！</p>
<p>直到現在還有人在替茀雷亞　坦和琴逑羅吉絲兩人拆夥可惜不已。他倆合作的歌舞片，如「雨打鴛鴦」及「風流艦隊」等至今深印影迷腦海中。自從拆夥之後，兩人都鬱鬰不得志，都沒有找到滿意的搭擋，雖然琴球羅吉絲已改　了作風。</p>
<p>在銀幕上專扮頑固的老太太的梅勞勃蓀，她已獻身於影業有五十六年的功夫了，她有一個年齡四歲的曾孫女，現在正在訓練她成為一個舞台童星。以勞勃蓀的經騐和學識加以孩子的天才，那個曾孫女大有成為秀蘭鄭波兒第二的可能。</p>
<p>銀幕上的「殺坯」詹姆士賈克奈自「都市風光」一片問世後，更　影迷歡迎，並有獲金像獎希望。賈克奈近作係與麗泰海華絲及奧麗薇哈佛蘭通力合演之「楊梅夫人」，由大導演羅爾華許負責導演。</p>

Minister Kong indicated that he would respond separately in writing. At 3 p.m., the group review committees were originally scheduled to meet separately to review the proposals, but due to the late adjournment in the morning, it was decided to cancel the meeting. It is said that the deadline for submitting proposals from councilors is 10 a.m. on the 5th, and over a hundred proposals have already been received. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>People from China and Burma Organize Yunnan-Burma Highway Committee; Aims to Unify Transportation on the Entire Route; Head of American Red Cross, Baker, to Serve as Chairman</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - According to reliable Chinese sources, the Yunnan-Burma Highway Committee, jointly formed by Chinese and Burmese individuals, is currently being organized. The purpose of the committee is to unify transportation on the entire route. It is said that transportation on the road is facing great obstacles due to the lack of a proper organization. Baker, the head of the American Red Cross in China, has been nominated as the chairman of the committee, but Mr. Baker has not accepted the position because he needs to wait for permission from the American Red Cross headquarters in New York. Mr. Baker recently came to Hong Kong with Cooley, an administrative assistant to President Roosevelt. When asked about this news, he refused to comment or deny it. It is noted that Mr. Baker was known worldwide eleven years ago for organizing and leading the Yangtze River flood relief efforts. He transported 600,000 tons of American barley and flour to the flood-stricken areas for distribution. (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Going to Burma Must Obtain Passports</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese citizens traveling overland from Yunnan Province to Burma normally do not need passports. However, the Burmese government amended the Burmese passport law in December last year, stipulating that all Chinese people entering Burma via the land route along the Sino-Burmese border, except for seasonal immigrants engaged in camel transport or seeking seasonal work, must hold passports. It has been decided to implement passport checks on the Sino-Burmese border on April 1 of this year. From then on, Chinese citizens going to Burma, whether by land or by plane, must obtain passports and have them signed by the consulate before departing. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Exchange Stabilization Fund Temporarily Not Moving to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Last night, official sources announced that the Central Bank would resume foreign exchange trading in Chongqing. When this was asked of well-informed Chinese banking circles here, they replied that the political significance of this move outweighed the economic significance. The management of the Exchange Stabilization Fund may not be moved from Hong Kong to Chongqing. It is said that this decision is only a precautionary measure, as developments may lead to a split in the Shanghai-Hong Kong foreign exchange market. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Government Raises Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Luoyang - During the recent northern invasion by Japanese troops in Xinyang, the southwestern and southeastern lines of Henan Province suffered greatly.

<h3>Coal and Iron Production in the Interior Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to figures released by the Steel and Iron Control Council of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the free areas of China produced a total of 300,000 tons of iron ore and 100,200 tons of pig iron last year, of which 34,000 tons were produced in Sichuan Province, and the remainder was produced in Shaanxi, Hunan, and Yunnan Provinces. Last year, the total value of coal produced in the Chinese interior was 114,000,000 yuan, and the value of steel and iron was 127,000,000 yuan. Before the war, the mainland China produced less than 2 million tons of iron and 15 million tons of coal. Before the war, there were 20 steel mills in China, all of which have been lost. However, 12 new steel mills have now been established in the interior to maximize production, which is sufficient to meet military and industrial needs. It is expected that China will be self-sufficient in steel and iron by the end of this year, as the new steel mills will be fully operational by then. Tin production is expected to be over 10,000 tons this year, and the production of antimony and tungsten is expected to increase by half compared to last year. The oil produced by the Gansu oil fields is also expected to increase. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing - According to sources arriving here, the Japanese have concentrated 400 bombers in Yichang, seemingly planning to bomb Chongqing again. In addition, authoritative Chinese sources said that 15,000 Japanese troops, with special mountain climbing equipment, a large amount of military supplies, and an air force squadron, have concentrated in Tokyo. However, the exact target of their attack is still unknown. However, if these sources are to be believed, the Japanese may be planning to cut off China's communications with Burma.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Abnormal International Situation and Crisis</h3>
<p>Germany has managed to circumvent and eliminate resistance from the Soviet Union, Turkey, and other international actors, and in one fell swoop has occupied Bulgaria, completing another blitzkrieg on the international stage. This was an inevitable development following the signing of a non-aggression pact between Turkey and Bulgaria, so the surprising point is not Germany's entry into Bulgaria, but the sudden change in Turkey's attitude prior to this. The rapid visits to the Balkans by Britain's Eden and Dill were attempts to remedy and plug this loophole. Now that Bulgaria's fate has been determined, other possible developments in the area are being actively brewing. What is noteworthy is: after the appearance of the German army on the Turkish border, what will Turkey's considerations regarding its strategic position, and the Soviet Union's position in this regard, be? Secondly, Bulgaria's acceptance of German control this time is in the form of joining the so-called "New Order"; the buffer zone between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and the New Order has been removed, and the Axis powers have advanced rapidly into the Balkans and the Near East. Therefore, the two countries have reached a critical juncture where they must choose either to recognize or oppose the New Order; the room for maneuver is shrinking, and the crisis of war is becoming more pressing. So, what will the two countries do?</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this time is a temporary victory for Germany on the one hand, and on the other hand, in addition to the blows suffered by Britain and Greece, the loss of strategic position and the crisis of security incurred by the Soviet Union and Turkey are also very serious. Tracing the source, the failure to adjust relations between Britain and the Soviet Union has been the greatest root of the unfortunate situation encountered by Britain, Greece, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Bulgaria, and its harm is still developing continuously. Perhaps more shocking international events will occur, giving the Axis powers the opportunity to break through individually. How to catch up quickly, how to adjust relations with each other, and how to unify each other's steps are not only urgent issues for Britain and Greece at present, but also urgent issues for the Soviet Union and Turkey.</p>
<p>Judging solely from the situation in the Balkans, the effect of Germany's dispatch of troops to Bulgaria is clearly to save Italy; its second step will probably be to pressure Greece to accept the proposal to negotiate peace with Italy, rather than directly using force against Greece. This can be inferred from the various statements issued by Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Bulgaria in recent days. However, the outcome has a very large fork in the road: one is that Britain and Greece, due to various reasons, reluctantly submit in Greece; one is that Britain and Greece resolutely resist to the end, awaiting the outcome on the battlefield; and one is that Turkey resolutely opposes Germany's attack on Greece with force, and the Soviet Union fully supports Turkey's position at the same time. Each of the three paths has its own reasonable grounds. The key depends on how effective Eden's activities in Ankara a few days ago and currently in Athens are; and the actual actions of Britain and Greece in the near future will provide the world with a concrete answer. The impact of this will also have a great impact on the situation in the Far East. Eastern violentists may see this as an opportunity to threaten Britain and the United States and brazenly advance south, and to work hard to adjust relations with the Soviet Union. Both are essential.</p>
<p>The latest news last night is that the Soviet Union, Turkey, Britain, and other countries have all separately stated their firm positions, which is an important sign of improvement in the international situation; however, this mere verbal and written statement is absolutely not enough to stem the deterioration; the improvement of the situation and the follow-up momentum of the signs depend on the close and rapid coordinated action of those who oppose violence!</p>
<h3>The Second National Political Consultative Conference: Chairman Chiang's Speech - Striving for Final Victory and Achieving Secure National Defense</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) In the current global upheaval, China's position has been elevated due to more than three years of bloody battles. However, China's responsibilities have also increased accordingly. In recent years, China has not only been a pioneer in defending peace but also a vanguard. At this time, it further proves that China is a major force in defending Eastern peace and justice. China's resolute and effective operations have not only increased the world's sympathy and trust in us but have also brought China into closer relations with all countries with common interests. China's operations are no longer an isolated event but have become a major factor in the world's safety and order. Under this new situation, I would like to ask all my fellow councilors and compatriots across the country to jointly recognize our country's goals and make further efforts. What are our goals? I solemnly tell you: First, the war must strive for final victory. Second, national construction must achieve absolute national defense security. The country to be built by the Three Principles of the People is one with solid national defense, developed civil rights, and prosperous people's livelihood. The national defense construction of the Three Principles of the People is for the purpose of self-defense, so it not only does not hinder civil rights and people's livelihood but is precisely to enable civil rights and people's livelihood to obtain true and permanent solutions under the guarantee of national defense security. Today, although our national strength has made great progress, and the international situation is also very favorable, in order to strive for our final victory, adapt to the world situation, and fulfill our greater responsibilities as China, we must require our national people to have a thorough self-awareness. We must know that our past efforts are not enough to meet the needs of the future. We must require the people to realize that only by completing our absolute and complete national defense can we complete all of our war and nation-building work. Therefore,</p>
<p>All construction must be national defense-oriented, and all citizens must be militarized. Based on this understanding, I would like to put forward the following opinions to you, hoping that they will be widely disseminated to compatriots across the country. First, in the political aspect, our national compatriots must recognize that all party concepts and the so-called left-leaning and right-leaning ideologies and theories are outdated and cannot adapt to today's world. We must face the grim reality of the world and accept the painful lessons of the war, with the construction of an absolutely secure national defense as the primary goal. The European war proved that only countries that can fight and win can maintain their independent survival; otherwise, they will be conquered and enslaved. Moreover, due to the progress of modern military technology and the strictness of economic control, once conquered, there will never be hope of regaining independence through one's own efforts. Today, the conquered nations will never be able to turn over, which is absolutely different from twenty or thirty years ago. Therefore, today, only politics suitable for combat is the politics of the new era, and only the ability to defend oneself can guarantee democracy. If one cannot fight, democracy is meaningless. Just look at the people who have already lost their country. What qualifications do they have to talk about democracy? Similarly, capital and labor in conquered countries all belong to the conquerors, and all political propositions become useless once the country is lost. The primary goal of the national revolution pursued by the Chinese Kuomintang is to save the country and seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, the Chinese Kuomintang has consistently taken</p>
<p>Consolidating popular strength and strengthening national defense as its mission, not only has it always understood the importance of national defense and called out to the people, but now it is also organizing compatriots across the country to wage an unprecedented bloody war of self-defense. In order to accomplish this mission, there is absolutely no room for party prejudice. It only requires all compatriots to strive together towards the sole goal of defending the country. On the government's side, it should rectify discipline to improve administrative efficiency and promote local democracy to establish the foundation of democracy. Although the National Assembly has been postponed, this is precisely to make the government take on greater responsibility to step up the promotion of local autonomy below the county level and create a strong grassroots organization throughout the country. The trend of the times has arrived, and we cannot but assume unprecedentedly difficult responsibilities. At the same time, we must also require all citizens to confirm the truth that the nation and national defense come first, abandon all outdated concepts that do not fit the times, and make the whole country a unified and strong combat entity, proving that China is a great force capable of self-defense and maintaining righteousness and peace. Second, in the military aspect, we must require all citizens to raise their awareness and faith in national defense, and we must require that the thoughts, actions, knowledge, and skills of all citizens meet the needs of a national war and serve to strengthen national defense forces together. In the future, the center of nation-building will be military construction, and politics, economy, education, culture, and national life must also be organized in a wartime manner to cooperate and advance with the military construction cause. Therefore, on the one hand, we should</p>
<p>Strengthen the army, reorganize training, enrich military strength, reform the conscription system, popularize military training, and improve combat skills. On the other hand, we must only raise national defense awareness and combat discipline to complete the mission of building the nation and the army. Third, in the economic aspect, we must take advantage of this wartime opportunity to establish the foundation of a national defense economy and, based on national defense needs, quickly complete the work of economic construction. This kind of wartime economic construction is not only limited to the current war period but must be extended to the post-war period until the day when an absolutely secure defensive national defense is achieved. In order to achieve this goal, the government should take various steps to adjust production and finance, improve transportation and transportation, and require all compatriots across the country to be universally frugal, work hard, concentrate capital, popularize labor, and further require the government and the people to work together to protect resources, develop military industry, improve national production capacity, implement necessary institutions for all economic activities, cultivate national strength, stabilize people's livelihood, and make the entire national strength continue to grow to adapt to the needs of national defense construction and support the progress of our economic construction. I also deeply believe that the consolidation and development of China's economy will be of great benefit to the whole world. The Father of the Nation's industrial plan put forward at the end of the First World War is not only the basic policy for the government to carry out national defense construction, but, looking at the overall situation, it is impossible not to fully realize this plan. Because the scale of this war is far greater than the previous European war, if the machinery and technology after the end of the war can be imported into China to develop China's economy, it can not only solve the panic and scramble caused by economic imbalances in the world but also lay the foundation for a century of peace in East Asia. However, this requires our country to establish a national defense economic foundation during the war and be able to work together to endure hardships and pains in order to complete the basic cause of wartime construction. Countries that do not work hard on their own are not qualified to hope for</p>
<p>Foreign capital, technological assistance and cooperation, even if there is, it is not equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. This is what we should deeply understand. In addition, whether in education and culture, or in national life, whether the government or the people, must make greater efforts based on this aspect. We must discuss and promote national morality, promote scientific knowledge and skills, popularize national education, and reward labor services, so that the country can fulfill its great duty of building national defense. We must comfort the wounded and dead, relieve disasters, give preferential treatment to anti-Japanese families, protect women and children, and promote health and sports to seek the safety and health of the population. In short, today, if we cannot fight, we will surely perish. Without national defense, there is no country. Without national defense, we cannot guarantee the survival of the nation, let alone protect civil rights and people's livelihood. The fundamental spirit of the Three Principles of the People is to consolidate national defense security to protect the welfare of the people. All our policies and all our facilities must be centered on national defense. All right and wrong must be judged according to national defense. Our army must become a highly national defense force. Our politics must become the general institution for mobilizing national defense forces. Our economy must be the greatest source for cultivating national defense forces. Our compatriots must also have</p>
<p>Combat knowledge, the determination to sacrifice for the country, and abide by the national laws and regulations. All cultural and educational undertakings must also meet the needs of national defense and become a part of national defense. We want to build a country with full national defense to protect civil rights and people's livelihood. We must reduce our personal lives to the lowest limit and exert our personal energy to the highest limit. We must abandon backward, narrow, self-interested factional concepts, and correct corrupt, lax, and decadent habits, so that the whole country becomes a strong combat entity, and then we can achieve the goal of driving out the Japanese army. Therefore, in the future, our country's administrative policy, on the one hand, must thoroughly implement the program of resistance and construction, and on the other hand, must also aim at creating a sound national defense. I deeply believe that in the future, our country must be more united in will and action. We must mobilize and organize the national forces to strive for the final victory to ensure the realization of the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, we must cooperate closely with all countries and nations that oppose the policy of aggression to jointly defend the peace of the world and East Asia. Gentlemen and councilors, today the whole world is encountering a great change, and our China is engaged in a desperate struggle. In terms of the world, the spiritual and material life of all countries will have</p>
<p>Great changes, all political and economic theories, will also have great changes, but one thing is undoubted, that only a country with a strong new-style military force and a modern organization can protect itself and survive, and all ideas and actions that weaken combat power and are not suitable for national combat will be eliminated by the times. In terms of our China, our country has the advantage of having a vast land, a large population, and abundant resources, and it is fortunate that it has already launched a war of national self-defense. The spirit and will of the people are adapting to the struggle of the new era. Internationally, we also have strong and loyal sympathy and assistance. It can be said that the future of our country has unfolded with great light and hope. However, the key to victory lies entirely in whether our national people can fully recognize the new world situation and make new efforts. During this period when the world is changing and the war is becoming more intense, at the first meeting of this Political Consultative Conference, I would like to express my beliefs to you gentlemen and compatriots across the country, hoping that this Political Consultative Conference will understand the times, be based on national needs, pool wisdom, make many contributions, assist the government, lead the people, and realize the ambition of our entire nation to strive for the final victory and complete the construction of national defense.

<h3>Japanese Warship Sunk off the Coast of Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Jinhua On the 27th of last month, a Japanese warship sailed to the waters off Gou Dong Men Mountain in Songmen, a county under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou. It dropped a small boat, loaded with Japanese soldiers, attempting to land on Gou Dong Men Mountain. The Chinese army bombarded it fiercely, sinking a Japanese warship, killing many Japanese soldiers, and capturing two alive. On the 28th, twenty more Japanese warships sailed over and fired more than a hundred shells at Songmen. The Chinese suffered no losses. (4th day telegram)</p>

<h3>The Balkan War Approaches: Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression, German Troops Rapidly Advance Towards Greek-Turkish Border, Building Positions Along the Struma River Valley</h3>
<p>London: Last night, Ankara Radio broadcast that the German occupation of Bulgaria was another incident of murdering the freedom of small nations, stating that the real reason for Germany's aggression in the Balkans was that German leaders had decided victory in the West was impossible. Therefore, they must explore other avenues, hoping to discover any exploitable gaps in Britain's defenses. The Axis powers' intention in spreading the war to the Balkan Peninsula was solely to draw a large part of the world into the vortex. Bulgarians may now believe they can avoid war, but will soon awaken and discover their country has become a battlefield filled with terror. Turkey's position has long been decided. The Turkish people are now calmly observing the situation and deeply believe that their leaders' recent actions will not alter the final outcome in the slightest. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkey is paying extremely close attention to the situation arising from the German occupation of Bulgaria. It is widely expected that Turkey will soon adopt various special defense measures to protect its interests. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu recently stated that Bulgaria, as Turkey's neighbor, seems to be within Turkey's security zone. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Sofia: It is reported that grey German troops were seen traversing the mountains and plains this morning, advancing through Bulgaria towards Macedonia. A large-scale Balkan war seems imminent. It is reported that the vanguard has already established positions on the Bulgarian border, from where they can enter Greece through the mountains. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The German vanguard is advancing rapidly in Bulgaria to accelerate the showdown between the Allied and Axis powers, precisely as Bulgaria quietly observes its Independence Day. It is reported that German mechanized detachments have established forward outposts south of Sofia and in the Struma River Valley, close to the Greek border. According to sources here, some German troops are moving towards the Turkish border. The German troops who have reached certain locations in the Struma River Valley are reportedly establishing battle positions, which are less than sixty miles from Thessaloniki. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The German vanguard, consisting of the 11th to 15th divisions, passed through Bulgaria yesterday in transport vehicles, consolidating its forward positions at six locations on the Greek-Bulgarian border. The exact locations of these positions are currently unknown. However, according to sources close to the Axis powers, they are near Kulata, Dala Yev, Bama, and Nevrokop. It is believed that German troops have occupied Velingrad on the Greek-Bulgarian border. It is also said that Germany currently does not wish to take any action hostile to Turkey. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Rumors circulated in Sofia yesterday that twenty German divisions had entered Bulgaria, with fifteen divisions advancing towards the Greek border. These rumors are clearly part of a Nazi psychological warfare campaign against Turkey. Military experts here say that such a large force is logically impossible, because the three highways Germany has acquired in Bulgaria could not have transported fifteen divisions in this period. Moreover, fifteen German divisions could not be immediately deployed on the Turkish border, where Bulgarian troops have never been stationed. Military experts believe that it is possible that five German divisions have moved to the border. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a telephoned report received by the Havas News Agency from someone who witnessed German troops entering Bulgaria, the German vanguard entered Bulgaria amidst northwesterly winds. The roads were frozen, but the vehicles advanced continuously. Damaged vehicles were repaired by repair teams accompanying the troops. The German troops experienced great hardship passing through the mountainous areas. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Bulgaria Permits German Troops Entry; Soviet Union Issues Stern Condemnation</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky yesterday gave the following reply to Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, Stamenov: "On March 1, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ardinoff declared to the Soviet Minister to Bulgaria that the Bulgarian government had indeed agreed to the entry of German troops into Bulgarian territory, stating that the purpose of this move was to ensure peace in the Balkans. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to make the following response: (1) The Soviet government does not agree with the Bulgarian government's assertion that its position is correct. Whatever the Bulgarian government's true intentions, this position will not consolidate peace. On the contrary, the position taken by the Bulgarian government will expand the war and drag Bulgaria itself into the conflict. (2) Based on this point, in order to maintain its peace policy, the Soviet government cannot provide any assistance to the Bulgarian government's implementation of the above policy. Recently, Bulgarian newspapers have spread false rumors, fundamentally distorting the Soviet Union's true position. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to make the above statement." (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Some interpret the Soviet Union's statement regarding the entry of German troops into Bulgaria as a warning not to interfere with Turkey and the Dardanelles. However, well-informed sources express doubt that they will actively intervene against the German advance into Greece. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The news of the Soviet Union's condemnation of Bulgaria's actions arrived too late, and most newspapers did not have time to comment. However, the "Daily Telegraph" reported that Turkey must recognize this news as an important guarantee for the security of its northeastern border. Mr. Batterworth also published an article in the "News Chronicle," stating that the Soviet Union's declaration may be intended to warn Germany, but it may also be a disclaimer that the Soviet officialdom could not support Bulgaria. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Diplomatic circles here stated today that the Soviet Union is making its greatest diplomatic effort to ensure that German troops in the Balkans move westward rather than towards the Dardanelles. Political observers here said that, according to news from Moscow, the Soviet Union has been alarmed by the potential danger of Germany occupying Bulgaria. The indirect buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Germany is becoming narrower, and the Soviet Union's nerves are becoming more sensitive. Some diplomats believe that the Soviet Union's protest to Bulgaria is "a significant change in Soviet foreign policy." Other diplomats said this is merely a superficial show to please Britain and the United States. The diplomatic correspondent of the British Newspaper Association said skeptically today, "Those who are keenly aware of the Balkan situation still do not believe that the Soviet Union's protest is a prelude to its actions." It is pointed out that the protest was made to Bulgaria, not to occupying Germany. However, most political commentators in London unanimously believe that, despite the German-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union's protest is a clear reflection of Soviet unease.

<p>Carrying Hitler's Letter: German Special Envoy Arrives in Ankara</p>
<p>Istanbul: A German Henkel bomber carrying a special envoy with German diplomatic documents arrived here. The special envoy immediately took a fast train to Ankara. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to news received here from Istanbul, the messenger carrying a special letter from Hitler to the Turkish President was brought to Istanbul last night by a German plane. According to reports, this letter is intended to reassure Turkey of Germany's peaceful intentions in the Balkans. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Recognizing the Agreement with Bulgaria as Invalid: Turkey Actively Makes Military Preparations</p>
<p>New York: According to a broadcast from an American radio station here, semi-official sources in Ankara claimed that after Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, German troops immediately entered Bulgarian territory. Therefore, Turkey believes that the non-aggression pact previously established between Turkey and Bulgaria is now invalid, because Bulgaria has lost its independence in terms of its domestic situation. Turkey is no longer bound by this non-aggression pact. If German troops attack Greece or Turkish territory, Turkey will have no choice but to resist with force. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Ankara: According to unconfirmed reports, British bombers visited Varna, a Black Sea port in Bulgaria. Turkey has officially ordered the mobilization of the third-tier reserves, while ordering the demobilization of another three tiers of soldiers. Officials deny the rumor that mines have been laid in the Dardanelles Strait. However, ships passing through the area must be piloted by Turkish pilots. Well-informed sources believe that British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff Dill have agreed with Turkey that, if Germany attacks Greece, British warships will have the right to pass through the Dardanelles Strait, and British land and air forces can obtain bases in Turkey. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: The newspapers here continue to focus on Bulgaria's adherence to the Axis Pact. "The Tanin" states that Bulgaria's move is "the prelude to aggression in the Balkans, and Turkey must be doubly vigilant." The "People's Party Organ" states that Bulgaria has long intended to join the pact. However, the date of Bulgaria's enslavement was only decided at this moment. Other newspapers all say that Bulgaria signed the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, but the ink was barely dry before it took this recent action. What is the reason? It must be explained. "The Ulus" states that the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement reiterates Bulgaria's intention not to resolve issues with neighboring countries by force. However, this depends entirely on how the obligations contained in the German-Italian-Japanese alliance with Bulgaria are implemented. The British-Turkish alliance has helped maintain peace in the Balkans and the Middle East. It is still hoped that Bulgaria will use its influence and utilize the two-nation pact to maintain peace. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's note is merely intended to express its opposition to Germany's actions and to draw the Axis powers' attention to the fact that the Soviet Union has not abandoned its interests in the Balkans. It is widely expected that the Soviet Union will not take any action beyond "paper protests" at this time. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Nazi Troops Pressing the Border: Aiming to Force Greece to Seek Peace</p>
<p>Sofia: Greek diplomatic circles here say that they have not yet heard of Germany exerting diplomatic pressure on Athens. It is expected that this pressure will begin when the Nazi divisions arrive at the Greek border. The number of German troops arriving in Sofia is still very small. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New York: Germany's recent actions in the Balkans have clearly indicated that Hitler is using the highest degree of pressure to intimidate Greece into suing for peace with Italy. Bulgaria's accession to the Axis powers and the concentration of German troops in Bulgarian territory have naturally caused extreme panic in Greece, which recently lost its national leader (Prime Minister Metaxas), and it urgently needs to decide between war and peace. Observers are speculating whether Metaxas's successor, Koryzis, can continue Metaxas's work under the pressure of the formidable German army. What Greece needs now is a strong and capable outstanding person to take charge of the government and maintain the spirit of war without faltering. However, in recent weeks, the Greek army's operations in Albania have slackened. This cannot be entirely blamed on the lack of leadership of the authorities, because the severe winter and ice and snow have greatly hindered the war. At the same time, Italian reinforcements have arrived in large numbers, strengthening the defenses. But if Heaven had granted more time, and Metaxas had not fallen like a star, then the Greek army would have likely conquered Tepelena by now. Metaxas was not only a supreme strategist, but also had the ability to lead the country and a strong will, and was the mainstay of the resistance. In today's Balkan situation, Greece must not only continue its previous fighting spirit, but also unite internally. Although there were many political enemies of Metaxas during his lifetime, due to his great personality, there was no open resistance. Today, Germany is making every effort to undermine Greece's unity and incite various opposition factions to fight each other. This is the reason why the German embassy is still maintained in Athens, because this allows for propaganda and diplomatic activities. In the near future, Greece will likely be persuaded to sue for peace again. This has been tried two or three times before. In the Germans' minds, a prime minister from a banking background should be easier to intimidate and entice than a prime minister from a military background. But so far, they have not succeeded. Perhaps Greece's decision will depend on the amount of aid that Britain and the United States can provide. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>British and Greek Authorities Continue Talks: Greece Determined to Resist to the End</p>
<p>Athens: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Eden's talks with the Greek authorities began on Sunday night and ended after midnight. Talks will continue this afternoon. British Imperial Chief of Staff General Dill also attended the meeting. It is widely expected that Eden and Dill will stay here for several days. The public's welcome is extremely enthusiastic. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens: The morning newspapers here today mostly published commentaries stating that, despite the development of events in the Balkans making the situation difficult and arduous, Greece will continue to fight. Observers believe that the newspapers' comments are sufficient to reflect the true sentiments of the Greek people. These people also said that this sentiment also reflects the views expressed by the new Prime Minister Koryzis in his broadcast to the United States last Saturday. The new Prime Minister said in the broadcast that Greece has been fighting fiercely since the war broke out four months ago. Our victory will be celebrated by the world, because this victory is a victory of justice over brutality. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Germany Coercing and Enticing: Southern Country in Difficult Situation</p>
<p>Southern Capital: Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday at his private residence in Slovenia (near the Yugoslav-Hungarian border). This news was learned from reliable sources, and it is confirmed that Prince Paul left the Southern Capital by special train on Sunday night, heading north. However, the Southern National Intelligence Agency officially denied reports of a meeting between Paul and Ribbentrop last night. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital: Reliable sources here stated today that Germany is demanding that the Southern Country issue a declaration beneficial to the Axis powers, stating that this move will not only safeguard the country's territorial status quo, but also obtain the important Greek military port of Thessaloniki. High-ranking Southern Country officials said that the Southern Country may join the Axis powers, but this is a matter of weeks, not days. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital: As the German army in the Balkans sweeps southward through Bulgaria, Nazi diplomatic cannons have been fired at both the Southern Country and Turkey. The purpose is clearly to get these Slavic peoples to quickly join the Axis camp and to reconcile with the Turkish people. The Southern Country is now in a clear dilemma between continuing to maintain neutrality and joining the Axis front. According to reliable sources, German Ambassador to the South, Hiren, has held talks with the leader of the Croatian independence movement. Hiren has begun to create another Sudetenland region in the Croatian region of the Southern Country. It is also said that Germany has asked the Southern Country to mediate the Greek-Italian war. According to diplomatic circles here, it will become clear in the next few days whether there will be war in the Balkans when the situation unfolds. (International News Service, 4th)</p>

<h3>London Times Discusses the Balkan Situation: The Nazi Military Leaders' Future Actions Are Expected to Follow Only Three Paths</h3>
<p>London: The Times commented on the future actions in the Balkans, stating that British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Chief of Staff General Dill were able to prove Turkey's firm loyalty to the British alliance in Ankara and discuss how to make the alliance effective in responding to the new German threat. Eden and Dill's visit to Athens also has the same purpose, and there are various reasons to expect that this trip will achieve the same results. The German invasion of Bulgaria cannot stop there. Nazi military leaders seem to have three paths to follow, namely, attacking Yugoslavia, Greece, or Turkey. Although Yugoslavia once adopted a policy of leaning towards Germany to counter Italy a few years ago, Germany has never won the hearts of the Yugoslav people. Moreover, the Yugoslav people are inherently not subdued by intimidation. Joining the Axis powers will be the most unpopular action. Belgrade has made every effort to deny any intention of taking this path. However, the Southern Country's strategic position is now completely surrounded by the Axis powers, with German troops facing its border with Bulgaria, making it extremely difficult. Rumors that Nazi troops have concentrated in various locations outside the Greek border may be the beginning of an invasion or the initial demonstration before issuing an ultimatum, which is unknown. The Greek General Staff and the British authorities who are consulting with it have thoroughly reviewed the above possibilities. No terrain in the Balkans is like the flat plains of Poland or northern France, where German mechanized units can gallop. Natural obstacles can provide tremendous help to a small number of resolute defenders. The Greek army's performance in Albania makes full use of the terrain of the mountains, but British assistance on land and in the air is also necessary. This assistance will be provided as much as possible. The talks currently taking place in Athens have undoubtedly discussed this in detail. As for when Turkey can put its great resources to the most advantageous use, the Turkish government and General Staff have thoroughly discussed this in their long talks with the two British dignitaries. It must be understood that Turkey cannot be unaffected by the blows that Germany is inflicting on Greece. Now that Britain has eliminated the threat to its bases in Egypt and the momentum of the winter war, it must unite its two allies in the Near East to jointly prepare to deal with the spring offensive predicted by Hitler in his recent speech.

<h3>British-Bulgarian Relations on the Brink of Rupture: Bulgarian Ambassador to Britain Resigns and is Approved</h3>
<p>Sofia: Non-official circles expect that British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, will announce the formal severance of British-Bulgarian relations today. Because the severance of relations between the two countries is imminent, British citizens in Sofia were busy yesterday preparing to leave the country, likely traveling to Istanbul via Burgas. Currently, there are only three British citizens in Sofia, apart from the approximately fifty personnel from the two embassies and consulates. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Bulgarian Minister to Britain, Momtchilov, resigned from the Bulgarian government due to his disapproval of the Bulgarian government's policy of joining the Axis powers. Yesterday, he received a reply from Sofia formally accepting his resignation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Turkey's New Budget: Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Turkish government's 1941 budget is 304,971,000 Turkish Lira, which is a significant increase from the 268,476,000 Turkish Lira in 1940. It is said that most of the increase is used for military purposes. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Thai-Vietnamese Border Disputes to End in a Few Days: Vichy Accepts Thai Demands in Principle, Japanese Advance Southward May Take This as a Turning Point</h3>
<p>Saigon: Lieutenant Colonel Koike, Secretary-General of the Japanese Military Delegation in Vietnam, recently told a United Press reporter that French representatives in Tokyo will sign a peace treaty with Thailand tomorrow or Thursday. (French officials said that Thailand's demands had been somewhat altered as a result of the French side insisting on its views, despite the expiration of the ultimatum's deadline. These people believe that the Vichy government has agreed in principle to the demands made by Thailand and Japan, and has ordered French representatives in Tokyo to sign a treaty that will result in significant losses of French territory.) Koike said, "I dare to assert that the French representatives in Tokyo will be able to sign a peace treaty tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Vichy has accepted the demands of Japan and Thailand in principle. Vietnam will cede a portion of its land, but not as much as Thailand originally demanded." He further said that Japan had sent an ultimatum to Vietnam, but he did not believe that the ultimatum threatened that Japan would take military action if the French side refused to accept it. He said, "If Japan had threatened with war, then Japan would have already attacked by the time the ultimatum expired if the French side had not yet yielded." Koike said that the Japanese residents in Saigon have been extremely alarmed in the past few days. Koike also accused French soldiers and detectives of insulting and assaulting Japanese people. Several Japanese people have suffered swollen eyes, injuries, and even had their teeth knocked out. "I really don't know why the French hate the Japanese," he said. He also said that Japanese residents will not withdraw from Vietnam. Koike also denied reports that the Japanese were continuing to ship large quantities of military supplies to Thailand, saying that this was natural because Thailand has no factories. Authoritative sources also said that there are now more than 300 Japanese aircraft at Japanese airfields in Hanoi and Haiphong. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: It was learned today that the French government hopes that Japan will stipulate the protection of French and Vietnamese people in the ceded territories in the mediation plan. Official news from Tokyo said that the Japanese Foreign Minister is discussing the wording of the final agreement with the French Ambassador. The Japanese side will send this final agreement to Vichy and Bangkok. Official news said that the French side will request that the status of French and indigenous people in the ceded territories be stipulated in the final agreement. The French government has accepted the Japanese mediation plan as the basis for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. It is believed that the French government wants to allow the French and Vietnamese people in the ceded territories to move their assets to French territory. However, this approach involves rubber plantations owned by French and Vietnamese people. It is believed that the French government wants to ensure that the Thai government will compensate these rubber planters. (United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: Observers here said that, given the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, France finally succumbed to Japan. It remains to be seen what Japan will do in the future and how it will expand its power in Vietnam. Although Thailand gained much from France's concessions, what Japan gained from France's concessions is no less than Thailand, or even more than Thailand. Whether Japan will now advance southward is still a matter of speculation here. If Japan continues to advance southward, then Britain will undoubtedly want to resist it. This is unquestionable. Reliable sources say that if the Dutch East Indies are attacked, they will formally declare war. It is said that the Dutch East Indies' first-line air force has several hundred new American aircraft, which are superior to those possessed by Japan. Therefore, the claim that the Dutch East Indies will declare war is not without basis. The only question now is what the United States will do if Japan intends to seize Singapore or the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that the United States is currently deliberately trying to keep Japan guessing. However, judging from the sentiment here, it would be risky to conclude that the United States will not act. At the same time, the internal situation in China remains a matter of concern. News about the friction between the Nationalists and Communists is quite complex and contradictory. Sympathy here tends towards Chongqing, hoping that both sides will cease fighting, unite the country, and support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Urges British Dominions to Assist Motherland in War; Safety of Each State Tied to Britain's Safety; Australia Does Not Favor Southern Countries Ignoring Current Crisis</h3>
<p>London – Australian Prime Minister Menzies, in a speech in London yesterday, stated that our objective has always been to be close to Japan. We do not want to make mutual jealousy our goal. We must be adults, not children; realists, not fantasists. As realists, we in Australia have adopted a local self-defense policy aimed at enabling us to resist any attacks from aggressor nations with our own strength. We have no reason to believe that the Pacific cannot live up to its name, as long as the people living on both sides of the Pacific are straightforward, intelligent, patient, and work hard to seek mutual understanding. Regarding Australian-American relations, if we truly believe that Americans are the same as Australians, then we should understand the relationship between America and Australia more deeply. Americans have their own ideals, and these ideals do not necessarily coincide with those of Australians. Americans also have their own interests, and these interests do not necessarily coincide with those of Australians. Australian foreign policy is never dictated by fear. The fact that Australia has dispatched diplomatic representatives to other countries does not indicate any trend toward separation within the British Empire. Anyone who holds this view is greatly mistaken. Now that Japan has reached a compromise with the Axis powers, Australia should not blindly place itself in an atmosphere that is at least questionable and, in fact, dangerous toward Japan. We must not be enveloped by the darkness of this kind of mist, nor can we be sacrificed by the most dangerous habit, which is the deep belief that war is unavoidable. Apart from the events that have already occurred in Europe due to the failure to drive out thieves, I do not believe that there are extremely straightforward international relations in the world that cannot avoid conflict or resolve difficulties. We are adults, and adults do not engage in childish brawls. If opinions differ, they can be voiced. For this reason, we have established direct and full diplomatic authority in Tokyo, but this only adds a strong line to the British organization. Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, or South Africans have never had any doubt about the crucial point that their own safety is tied to the safety of Britain. Today, the deployment of troops from French territories to assist in the war is no accident. Those in the dominions with even a little knowledge know that if the center of the British Empire is struck, then other parts will be greatly affected. The people of the British Empire everywhere now understand that if all parts are united, then Britain will certainly not fail. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Signs Order Freezing Bulgarian Funds in the US</h3>
<p>Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently stated that the US government will issue a new "asset freeze" order today. While Morgenthau declined to comment specifically on the scope of this order, he hinted that it may apply to all countries. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday signed an order freezing Bulgarian deposits in the United States. This action was proposed by Secretary of State Hull to the Treasury Department. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's freezing of Bulgarian deposits will not have a major impact on the financial world. President Roosevelt signed this order just two days after German troops entered Bulgaria. According to recent surveys, Bulgarian investment in the United States is less than $10 million, while American investment in Bulgaria is less than $10 million. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium last spring, this order freezing Bulgarian deposits is the eleventh such freezing order. It is said that the Treasury Department has prepared an executive order freezing Italian and German deposits, but it is only awaiting the President's signature. However, some people believe that President Roosevelt's order freezing German and Italian deposits may be issued after the Lend-Lease Act is passed. It is estimated that German deposits in the United States amount to $113,000,000, and Italian deposits in the United States amount to $82,000,000, totaling approximately $200 million.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Leaders in the Philippines Hold Meeting to Discuss Methods of Protecting Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Manila – Japanese sources say that overseas Chinese leaders from all over the Philippines have been summoned to attend a meeting at the Chinese Consulate in Manila this afternoon to discuss ways to protect overseas Chinese in the Philippines in the event of an imminent crisis in the Pacific. At the meeting, the Chinese Consul read out ten measures to protect overseas Chinese and instructions from the Chinese government in Chongqing. The meeting decided to establish a committee to protect overseas Chinese in the Philippines, which will continue to meet tomorrow to discuss other emergency measures. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Army Department Orders Gas Masks</h3>
<p>Washington – The US Army Department has ordered gas masks for non-combatants in military administrative areas. The Army Department announced this yesterday, saying that a limited number of gas masks have already been ordered, and five manufacturers will supply some low-priced gas masks. There are currently no plans to expand the convenience of gas mask manufacturing. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Raid Central London, South Wales Targeted; British Planes Bomb French Coast</h3>
<p>London – Last night, German planes raided central London, targeting a city on the coast of South Wales. It appeared that one German plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. German planes dropped a large number of incendiary bombs, and then bombed the fires. Many civilian homes were destroyed, and the number of dead and wounded is likely to be high. Enemy planes also dropped bombs along the northeast coast and southeastern Scotland. Some houses were destroyed, but the damage was not great. The main target of the German planes was the city of Cardiff in South Wales. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – On Sunday night, the British Air Force launched a fierce attack on the invasion ports on the French coast. The attack could be clearly seen from the south coast of England, but due to the strong winds in the Channel, the sound of explosions could not be heard. Large fires broke out in Calais and Boulogne, filling the sky with red light. Searchlights shone along 20 miles of the French coast. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters Air Force correspondent said that it is noteworthy that Germany has changed from indiscriminately bombing London and other major cities to a more planned blockade air raid, with coastal cities as its main target. The German Air Force on the Western Front is now focusing on attacking ships, laying mines, and bombing ports in order to strike the source of supplies from the United States to Britain. To date, Germany has transferred approximately 600 aircraft to the Balkans, but it is believed that the German side has not yet prepared forward bases in Bulgaria. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on Albanian Front, Italian Counterattacks Fail</h3>
<p>London – The Greek radio station in Athens broadcast a message from the Greek intelligence department, stating that the Greek army had twice repelled fierce attacks by the Italian army. The Italian army first bombarded heavily with artillery, and then attacked at sunset, while the Greek army fiercely struck from a height of 5,000 feet, preventing the Italian army from advancing. The Italian army's two attacks after dusk were also repelled, suffering heavy losses. According to the Greek communique broadcast last night, Greek infantry operated in small units, and the artillery was also fierce and successful. The Greek Air Force shot down two enemy planes, and no Greek planes were damaged. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British and German Troops Encounter in Coastal Area of Libya, British Troops Continue to Make Progress on East African Front</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German news agency reported that British and German patrols had an encounter in the coastal area of Libya. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters special correspondent with the troops cabled from the Keren front, stating that the city of Keren, located approximately 75 miles from Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, has a steep terrain and strong defenses. The Italian side has also deployed elite troops to defend it to the death, so it is not easy for the British Empire forces surrounding the city to capture it for the time being. Currently, the artillery of both sides is fiercely attacking each other. The British artillery moves quickly, constantly changing positions, surprising the enemy and bombarding them fiercely. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo – The British General Headquarters announced this morning that British troops are continuing to advance beyond Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland. It is said that British troops penetrated deep into Italian territory and occupied the important village of Afgoi, 80 miles northeast of Mogadishu, yesterday. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters special correspondent cabled from an air force base on the Sudan-Eritrea border, stating that the British victory in Italian Eritrea is due in no small part to the British Air Force's bombers, South African fighter planes, and Rhodesian squadrons. These British troops have been fighting in the sweltering heat for many weeks and have driven the Italian Air Force out of the sky, so British infantry on the front lines now rarely see Italian planes. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – According to official announcements, a total of 140,000 Italian soldiers have been captured in the Libyan campaign. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Painful History of the European War (7) – The British and French Allied Forces' Initial Missteps in the War</h3>
<p>Regarding the painful history of France's defeat, the records in magazines and newspapers in Europe and America have been surging up like a storm, and have not yet subsided. Among them, the book "The Great Tragedy of France" by the French writer Morlot can be called a masterpiece, and has been translated by this newspaper and published in succession. Now there is one more article left. Due to the crowding of translated manuscripts, it has been delayed until now to be published, so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture:</p>
<p>In early October 1939, after the first batch of British troops had just arrived in France, I was invited to serve as a liaison officer at the British Army Headquarters, preparing to maintain contact between the British army and French civilians through various methods such as writing, lecturing, and radio broadcasting as the war progressed.</p>
<p>During the last World War, I also served as a liaison officer in the British army, and I was naturally overjoyed to be able to do it with ease. Wearing my lieutenant's uniform (this was my military rank in 1918), I went to Arras to meet Lord Gort, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army.</p>
<p>At this time, General Gort was stationed at Fort Habarcq near Arras. I was received by two adjutants. One was a Scottish officer, Gordon, who was handsome, wearing a checkered Scottish kilt, and a bright, silver-handled short sword inserted in his striped stockings. The other was the amiable Sir Montagu, a descendant of King William IV of England's informal union. They received me in a small room and offered me a strong beer, the taste of which was unique. They called it "The Terror of Habarcq." After I accepted it, they led me to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the Commander-in-Chief's office was truly unprecedented in my life. A card was nailed to the door with four drawing pins, on which was written in a scrawled handwriting "Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters." There was no furniture in the room. Two white wooden benches were placed on top of a wooden board, which was considered the Commander-in-Chief's desk. Lord Gort believed that a commanding general should share the joys and sorrows of his soldiers, so he was so simple and crude. He was naturally active, but during the war, walking was his only pastime. At dawn, he walked on the muddy roads around Arras, his elbows close to his sides, his neck straight, striding forward, a khaki military cap on his head, completely blocking the raindrops, with an adjutant panting and following closely behind him.</p>
<p>Gordon told me that one day the Commander-in-Chief took him to the Claridge Hotel for a military conference with General Gamelin. He was very happy, thinking that he could enjoy a night out in Paris. Unexpectedly, after dinner, Gort said to him, "Now we can go for a walk."</p>
<p>He kept his elbows close to his body, straightened his neck forward, and walked non-stop, circling the Louvre Palace three times, and then ran back to sleep, while Gordon followed behind him dejectedly.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had met Gort. I was very moved by his youthful spirit and vitality. The British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, had indeed revitalized the British Army Headquarters. Our conversation was very quick and easy. Lord Gort first talked about Hitler's plan.</p>
<p>General Gort said, "Will Hitler go through Belgium? I think he will, because that is the only route for Germany to advance. You must remember General Foch's famous saying: 'In times of war, we must do everything, do what we can do, and use what we can use.' However, the Flanders region is muddy everywhere in winter, and I don't think Hitler will attack at this time. If there is no movement for a few months, I am afraid that our morale will be slack."</p>
<p>I said, "In 1914, we also hid in the trenches all day."</p>
<p>"That was a different situation. We can't generalize. At that time, we were facing a formidable enemy, so naturally we couldn't be lax. Now we are guarding a line in front of Lille and Douai." (As he said this, he suddenly stood up and pointed out the defensive line on the map to me.) "In front of us, there is only a neutral Belgium. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to maintain the fighting spirit of the army! If it drags on like this, we have to find a way to divert their attention."</p>
<p>He also said, "You should tell the British army more about the situation of the French army, and you should also convey the situation of the British army to the French army. We must also give the various units frequent opportunities to meet each other. Your Seventh Army is stationed on the left wing of the British army, and I myself often visit their commander, General Giraud. He is truly a brave general."</p>
<p>General Gort's principle during the war was always to discard useless things completely, so he didn't even have an ashtray.</p>
<p>The next day, I began to inspect the front lines. As General Gort said, there was nothing to be seen in front of the defensive line except for checkpoints and Belgian police. But once the German army invaded Belgium, this area would become a battlefield. The fragility of the defensive line made me shudder.</p>
<p>What was the situation on the Lille front in October 1939? Steel-reinforced concrete bunkers surrounded by barbed wire were scattered around, one or two kilometers apart. Each bunker was manned by British soldiers. Each bunker had a periscope to look out over the battlefield, as well as a machine gun and a Bren light machine gun. In addition, although I heard that there was also a flat-trajectory gun, there was actually only a gun mount, and the gun had not been delivered.</p>
<p>A trench to defend against tanks meandered between them, dug not deep enough, and not yet completed. Further back, a group of British soldiers were busy digging trenches and shelters. But at this time of year, the Flanders region is always ankle-deep in mud, and this kind of work is inevitably futile. They couldn't dig a few feet deep before a stream of water gushed out from the ground. They fancifully used wooden planks and grass mud to block the all-pervasive source of water. The result was naturally disappointing.</p>
<p>One reporter asked, "Is this our defensive line? God only knows! The attacking forces now are ten times more powerful than in 1914, but our defensive works are ten times weaker than in 1914!"</p>
<p>Many news reporters' faithful reports were detained by the strict censorship office. They had no choice but to suppress their anxiety and perfunctorily deal with the public. But the officers who guarded this defensive line tried their best to appear not pessimistic. One officer pointed out a trench that his subordinates had painstakingly dug to me, and said in a self-deprecating tone, "This trench obviously can't stop a tank. But there is still a forest in front, and we can only hope that the enemy's tanks won't come this way!"</p>
<p>However, in the following weeks, British and French military experts began to extensively construct defensive works. Behind the defensive line, countless workers worked hard to build new steel-reinforced concrete fortifications. Steel skeletons were visible everywhere on the battlefield, forming the outline of new bunkers. Nearby, there were also cement experts sent by the British, mixing mud, sand, and gravel into concrete. In the French defense zone, the camouflage of the new bunkers was very clever, looking like ordinary houses, which the General Headquarters was very satisfied with.</p>
<p>At this time, many people in the French army were reading General Chauvineau's book "Is Aggression Still Possible?" This general was a professor at the Army University, and he came to the conclusion that steel-reinforced concrete bunkers had made aggression absolutely impossible. Such works can be built quickly. Even when the enemy occupies the first defensive line, the defenders can already build the second defensive line. Unfortunately, he completely ignored two facts: first, there may be new ways to attack steel-reinforced concrete fortresses; second, once the enemy breaks through one point, they can copy to the back of the steel-reinforced concrete defensive line. In fact, the British and French armies braved the cold rain and snow and worked hard throughout the long winter to build this defensive line, which was never subjected to a frontal attack by the enemy.</p>
<p>Not only that, most military experts mistakenly believed that the German army would not attack Belgium. Today's Belgian army is strong and well-equipped, so why should Germany drive fish into the deep sea and add a strong enemy? They also firmly believed that the Maginot Line was as solid as a rock, so Hitler only had two routes to advance: one from the Netherlands, and one from Romania. But Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Germany's last respiratory organ, and Romania had already transported her remaining gasoline to Germany, so both of these routes were impassable. Their conclusions were that Germany would not take any action this summer. Time was on our side. By 1941, we could gain air superiority, and by 1942, we could have many tanks and heavy artillery enough to destroy Germany's Siegfried Line. This kind of view was everywhere at that time, and it was used as a topic of conversation at every front-line dinner party. I myself also had this illusion.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Relief for Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Schools – Principles of Universality and Fairness – Statements Released by Education Authorities –</h3>
<p>Allocation Standards Not Yet Officially Ordered, Various External Rumors are Untrue</p>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Since the Shanghai education community requested higher salaries and government relief due to the ever-increasing cost of living, relevant authorities, recognizing the admirable spirit of educators persevering on this isolated island despite meager incomes and difficult living conditions, immediately submitted a request to the Ministry of Education, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan. The Yuan approved the allocation of relief funds. The news was met with jubilation. However, specific measures have not yet been officially ordered, and the outside world, unaware of the truth, has made many conjectures and even spread various rumors, causing widespread discussion. To clarify the truth, a reporter from Dahua News Agency inquired with relevant authorities. The responsible official released the following statement:</p>
<p>Various External Rumors are Groundless</p>
<p>Regarding the central government's relief for teachers and staff in Shanghai, it is indeed true that a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Education and forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which has approved it and instructed the Ministry of Education to handle it. This is a completely accurate fact. However, as of now, no specific measures have been officially ordered. Various external rumors should not be easily believed. Before receiving the Ministry's order, no one dares to say that a decision has been made. From this, it can be inferred that the so-called allocation by the Ministry is without any legitimate basis.</p>
<p>Only Received Ministry Order to Report Numbers</p>
<p>On the Shanghai education administration side, regarding the allocation of relief funds, we have only received an order from the Ministry of Education to investigate and report the number and class levels of teachers and staff who should be given relief. There are no other instructions whatsoever. The number of teachers and staff to be reported has been compiled based on the survey forms reported by various schools and telegraphed for approval. It includes all teachers and staff of public middle schools and private registered primary and secondary schools, indicating that the administrative side's allocation of this relief fund is entirely based on the principle of universal relief. How the Ministry of Education will review and approve it, no one can predict before receiving an official order. This common sense is expected to be understood by the general public.</p>
<p>Public Schools to Seek Other Sources of Funding</p>
<p>It is true that public schools are financially strapped and teachers and staff are poorly paid. The government will naturally try to remedy the situation to the best of its ability. However, since the allocation of relief funds should be based on the principle of universality, it cannot be resolved within the same measures, but should seek other sources of funding. Therefore, the Shanghai administrative side's opinion is that the case of increasing subsidies for public schools should be handled separately as a special case.</p>
<p>Brainstorming, Forming a Committee to Preside</p>
<p>In summary, the Shanghai education authorities are entirely taking into account the overall situation and working together with colleagues in the education community. They have decided to respect the opinions of educators themselves and will invite other party and government agencies and relevant organizations to form a special committee to preside over the allocation, in order to implement their original intentions. It is hoped that all teachers and staff in the city will not easily believe rumors, so as to avoid being ridiculed for creating unnecessary disturbances. Once the Ministry of Education's official order is decided and the funds are allocated, it will be announced to the public as soon as possible and distributed as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held for the Late Musician Xiao Youmei – Teaching Tirelessly for Thirty Years – Memorial Service Scheduled for the 8th of This Month</h3>
<p>The death of Xiao Youmei, the principal of the National Conservatory of Music, is a great loss to Chinese musicians. In his early years, Xiao was appreciated by the Founding Father and joined the Tongmenghui. For 30 years, he taught music tirelessly. When the war broke out, the National Conservatory of Music was destroyed by artillery fire. He was ordered by the Ministry of Education to continue his work in Shanghai. Although the surroundings were difficult, Xiao continued to struggle. Recently, he fell ill due to worry and overwork, and eventually passed away. His circumstances after his death were bleak, and there was almost nothing to pay for his funeral. In addition to the school's teachers and students requesting preferential treatment from the central government and the Ministry of Education, it has been heard that Xiao's funeral committee has scheduled a memorial service for 2 pm on the 8th of this month at the American Church at 53 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. Famous musicians at sea, Zhao Meibo, Zakharoff, Shushlin, Shertzoff, and Livshitz, have been specially invited to perform Xiao's posthumous works. People from all walks of life are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Board Meeting of the Orphanage for Refugee Children – Gao Huailiang and Qu Zhenju Elected as Director and Deputy Director</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Orphanage for Refugee Children held its third plenary board meeting at the Shipping Club at 3 pm yesterday. More than 50 board members, including Ding Fangyuan, Zhang Lianfang, Gu Wensheng, Zhang Qulin, Wang Shirong, Dong Wenti, Sheng Zhiren, Dai Chunfeng, Fu Qiangeng, Chen Xianmo, Ge Futian, Qu Zhenhua, Cheng Kefan, Jiang Yangbin, Yuan Ludeng, Gao Huailiang, Xu Wenzhao, Jiang Guiqing, Mao Derun, Lu Yien, and Ye Ruizhai, etc., attended. Yuan Ludeng chaired the meeting. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that since the reorganization committee took over the reorganization of the orphanage, the internal affairs have been adjusted in detail, and all orphanage affairs have been gradually improved. The previous concerns of the outside world have been clarified. Previously, I also served as the director, as a transitional arrangement, temporarily serving concurrently. Now that the orphanage affairs are on track, I can no longer serve as the director concurrently. Therefore, this meeting is convened to elect a director and a deputy director, so that they can be responsible for handling the orphanage affairs. Then, the discussion began, and Gao Huailiang was elected as the director and Qu Zhenhua as the deputy director. Everyone agreed and passed the resolution. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Food: 1,020,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai in the Past Two Months; Roughly Enough to Feed the Entire City for Four Months; The Crime of Hoarding and Speculation by Profiteers is Clearly Outrageous</h3>
<p>The source of foreign rice is related to the city's food supply, so this newspaper pays special attention to it. Special reporters are dispatched to the Valley Shipping Company every day to investigate and disclose information at any time, which is presumably seen by people in the community. It was found that a total of 539,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in January this year, which has been recorded in previous reports. A total of 479,798 bags of foreign rice arrived in February, including 24,000 bags directly from Fangfang, 122,889 bags from Saigon, 20,969 bags from Siam, and 121,000 bags from Rangoon. The remaining 189,940 bags were from Hong Kong. Foreign rice imports in February were 59,468 bags less than in January. The total for the two months was 1,019,064 bags. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yau Sang, arrived from Hong Kong with 4,404 bags of broken rice. The ship berthed at Roosevelt Wharf at 3:00 PM and began unloading today. The foreign rice on board is the first batch for March. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Premium of 1,000 Yuan: 100 Tons of Small Ground Rice Traded; To Date, Only Hoarding and Intensified Price Increases of Foreign Rice Seen</h3>
<p>The price manipulation of foreign rice was even more unscrupulous yesterday. Sakura Company's original packaged small ground rice spot goods were limited to 92 yuan, but yesterday a premium of 1,000 yuan was added to trade 100 tons, that is, a premium of 10 yuan per bag, for 102 yuan. Other existing foreign rice with premiums of 5, 6, 6, 7, and 8 yuan have become secretly public. The so-called limited price has been completely destroyed by these profiteers, and the authorities turn a blind eye. However, in addition to the 800,000 bags of foreign rice in the godowns, there are also many private secret hoards and savings of newly arrived rice. Therefore, the public investigation and order to sell should not be delayed any longer. New transactions were made for 1,000 tons of broken rice in March and April, at a price of 96 yuan. He Yi threw it out, and Jian Yuan asked for 97 yuan, and was in the process of telephoning. There were also many other transactions in progress, but importers also took advantage of this chaotic situation to claim that water transportation costs had increased and shouted up their prices. This lifting and pulling will surely lead to people having no food to eat.</p>
<p>Rice in the market has been pulled out by hoarders and is no longer available. It is the same as the dead market. Only Hong Kong glutinous rice is being sold slightly, but the price continues to soar by 2-3 yuan, starting from 95 yuan to 93 yuan. Only thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice are available. However, because ordinary shops feel that foreign rice is difficult to purchase, they have all switched to domestic rice, resulting in a sudden boom in sales. With few sources of supply and hoarders speculating, the market suddenly soared, rising by a huge 3-4 yuan. Chang Bang’s white japonica rice opened at 115 yuan per dan, Kunshan’s japonica rice at 112-113 yuan, and Qingjiao’s thin japonica rice saw a special price from 109.5 yuan to 107.5 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Flour Hoarding Even More Severe; Foreign Flour and Wheat Both Arriving</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's trading was quite active. Although new foreign wheat has arrived at the Chinese factories selling flour at a flat price, they have not yet supplied flour. At this time, there are many rumors, and overseas sources are feared to be interrupted at any time. Everyone wants things to be good, and customers who hoard rice have come to hoard flour. The market is full of buying interest, and sellers are simply pushing up prices. It is said that the opening price of Australian flour from the Flower Bird Clock Tower was 28 yuan, and it immediately rose to 10 and 50 cents. Golden Dragon Spleen Flour also rose from 27 yuan to 27.3 yuan. However, in the afternoon market, it was rumored that the Philippine Gies had brought 60,000 bags of American flour and 10,000 bags of foreign wheat, which had arrived in port, and people's hearts softened slightly. The Flower Bird brand returned to 28.1 yuan, and the Ming Long brand returned to 27.1 yuan. After the market price, it was rumored that the newly arrived foreign flour had been sold out, so the market trend once again became firm. In the end, in the face of the changing situation, food is a necessity of life, so ordinary floating capital hoarders are paying attention to purchasing food and daily necessities, resulting in this kind of environment, which is really worrying for the future of people's food.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was still firm. The source of domestic Dumai wheat can be said to be completely exhausted. Although foreign wheat has been transported, the new arrival of 20,000 bags is still not enough to supply the flour mills. It is said that the price of wheat stored in warehouses in the concession has been rising frequently, reaching a call price of 45 yuan. The daily factory gate collection price is also being secretly released, but there is no goods to collect, so the market is becoming more and more secretly firm.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Floating Households Emerge; Rise in Soybean Oil Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>The market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes yesterday was still crazy in the early morning. The market price seemed to rise endlessly, but after that, the positive atmosphere dissipated, and the general profit-taking floating nationals emerged, causing the price rise to be slightly reduced, like a ball being kicked out. It is estimated that the current oil market has stabilized. The oil that rose by 1 yuan first, and then hung up half a yuan. Yellow beans are guarding the original plate from the previous day, corn rose first and fell later, and bean cakes rose slightly by 10 cents. The overall situation is because the bulls are strong and difficult to shake for the time being. However, it is not surprising that there may be small fluctuations in the short term.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Softens in Both Official and Black Markets; Speculation is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate was announced at 9:00 AM, and all of them were reduced. The British flag was changed to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.375 yuan. Other exchange rates such as the Dutch guilder and the Japanese yen were uniformly reduced by varying amounts. As for the situation in the domestic market, the wind once rippled. The current US exchange rate was once quoted at 5.46875 yuan, but near noon, due to negative rumors, the situation turned stable. The after-market also initially showed signs of loosening, but later, due to the Hong Kong power company entering the market, speculators changed from plugging to pulling, causing the trend to recover. Due to tense relations between Britain and Germany, and various other news, people's hearts were unsettled. The result of the evening close was a current US exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, and a British exchange rate of 3 shillings and 3.75 pence, each softening by 0.03125 compared to yesterday.</p>

The British gold price was 3 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day. After the opening, the foreign exchange industry had only inflows and no outflows, so the market had already softened. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold spot shillings to foreign exchange companies at 3 shillings and 3.90625 pence. Soon after, the Japanese bank first traded spot US exchange rates, which also tightened to 5.5 yuan. At 9:30, the HSBC exchange rate was announced, and all exchange rates were reduced. The British exchange rate was changed to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.375 yuan, which fell by 0.0625 and 0.125 respectively. After this, speculation and Hong Kong power purchases were quite strong. The current US exchange rate was once quoted at 5.46875 yuan. When the Sass Bank made some supplies, the potential trend slightly shifted. It is estimated that the Chinese bank's selling price for the March US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan. Later, it was learned that speculators were still paying, so the foreign exchange companies sold the March US exchange rate to speculators again at 5.4375 yuan. By noon, there were sudden negative rumors, and the buying momentum subsided slightly. The spot US exchange rate was 5.5 yuan, and the shilling was 3 shillings and 3.90625 pence.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Electric's Purchasing Appetite is Huge</p>
<p>In the after-market, speculators sold first, and a certain American bank ate up the volume. Therefore, the March US exchange rate was first opened at 5.53125 yuan. Later, Hong Kong Electric entered the market with a huge amount, and foreign exchange companies supplied quickly, so the market was more cheerful. The March rate reached 5.46875 yuan, and speculators could not keep up with the trend. The evening close resulted in a spot US exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, and the March rate was 5.46875 yuan. The spot and current shilling rates were both 3 shillings and 3.75 pence, which was 0.03125 yuan tighter than the closing price of the US exchange rate on the previous day, and the British exchange rate was also 0.03125 tighter.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Reported Loose</p>

The Shanghai exchange rate of 1.5 yuan was 88.5 yuan, and the black market exchange rate of "Lianchao" was 3.25 yuan, which was 75.75 yuan. (The telegraph code may have errors and needs to be verified)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Uncertain</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Tuesday) Electric, the exchange market opened this morning with volatility and uncertainty. The British and Japanese exchange rates were still changing.

<h3>Amidst Rumors, the Gold Market Rose and Fell Uncertainly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the Shanghai black market fluctuated greatly, rising sharply and then falling, and finally returning to an upward trend. Speculators believed that the important key of 5.5 yuan for the US exchange rate had been broken, but under negative news, the upward momentum of all directions was repeatedly suppressed. Initially, continuing the upward trend of the previous day, foreign exchange was reported to be tight, and securities companies, bank silver companies, and gold companies pushed hard, and it was once seen at 6,390 yuan. However, the good times did not last long. At around 11:40, the situation suddenly changed. It was rumored that the United States had expanded the freezing of funds worldwide, and foreign exchange loosened amidst the chaos. Moreover, Xin Yuan came out, resulting in news that a bull company in Shanghai West was selling. Those who followed the trend gathered, and there was a 200 yuan decline, retreating to a low price of 6,190 yuan. At noon, the gold companies absorbed and raised the price, and in the afternoon it rose again to over 6,300 yuan. The relationship between the United States and Germany deteriorated, and the United States will recall its ambassador to Germany, and Germany also plans to withdraw overseas Chinese businessmen in the United States. The price fell again at one time, and finally rose again, still squeezed by a small 6 yuan. The total transaction for the whole day was more than 40,000 taels. Cash was issued by Cheng Ji, Chu Xing, and Yong Yi for 100 taels, and the price was 510 yuan higher than the forward price. Yong Feng issued 200 taels to Xiang He, 520 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Ju Feng Yong issued 10 taels each to Yu Tai Yong and Xiang Yu Yong, 510 yuan higher. The price of jewelry gold has been raised by a small 10 yuan to 690 yuan.</p>
<p>200 Yuan Fell from the Sky</p>
<p>In the early morning, after the close of the previous day, the off-market price rose. But the bull's mentality saw an increase. At the opening, only buying was heard on the table, raising the price to 6,360 yuan, more than 60 yuan better than the previous day. After the opening, under Xiang He's strong purchase, it rose another 10 yuan to 6,370 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong, Cheng Ji, and Heng Ji and others sold and filled, and the rising momentum was blocked, and was first suppressed to 6,315 yuan. However, the domestic and foreign exchange rates were reported to be tight, and the buyer's confidence was extraordinarily brave, such as De Fu, Gong He, Cheng Ji, Heng Ji, Fu Shi buying trend, straight up to 6,390 yuan. But at this time, a negative rumor suddenly arose in the market, and the public was slightly moved and tended to sell, and the falling trend was also fast, even breaking through the 300 and 200 yuan marks, retreating to 6,190 yuan. Afterwards, it began to hover, relying on Cheng Ji, Xiang He, Da Feng and other households to absorb, and promoted to 6,260 yuan to close. The opening in the afternoon was quite expensive, at 6,290 yuan, but retail investors came to spit, reaching a small 6,260 yuan, and finally Cheng Da, Da Feng, etc. entered the market one after another, and the trend went upward. Tian Yuan once acted as an agent for Xie Tai Yong to enter 110 taels, for a high price of 6,308 yuan. Later, Heng Ji. Tong Kang Yong and others sought to sell, and slowly dropped to 6,245 yuan. The exchange market was still reported to be tight at the time, and De Fu and Cheng Ji Xin Yuan and others were dredging, and soared to 6,292 yuan. The closing was 6,290 yuan, 6 yuan smaller than the previous day. According to the closing price of 5.46875 yuan for the March US gold, it was 6,368 yuan, which is estimated to be 78 yuan. The off-market price after the close was about 6,300 yuan, and the rise and fall for the whole day was 200 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold brand of the cash number was higher than the Shanghai black market (spot price higher by more than 10 yuan, the buying price was lower by 30 yuan), and there was no market for the current spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Returned to a Small 10 Yuan</p>

<h3>Gold Pound Slightly Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency situation, because of the Shanghai black market price, rose and fell flat, but the cash tended to soften, so the British and American gold pounds each fell by 2 yuan. The British gold ticket remained unchanged, and the market price stabilized. The British gold ticket had once risen to 18 yuan, 1 dime and 1 cent, but finally settled at 17 yuan, Wan Jiao Ban, which was 5 cents lower than the previous day.

<h3>Wonderful Ways to Protect Wealth</h3>
<p>— Saint Ke Qiong</p>
<p>As early as last year, when the author was writing financial commentary for this newspaper, in view of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East and the imprudence of speculation in the foreign exchange market, I advised general asset owners to promptly transfer their funds inland and encouraged the purchase of gold public debt. At that time, although the author spoke earnestly, asset owners listened with contempt. The fact is more eloquent than words. The situation in the South Pacific is becoming more tense day by day, and the possibility of a US-Japanese war breaking out at any time is high. The Shanghai Concession is also likely to be occupied by Japan at any time. General asset owners are finally alarmed by the smell of gunpowder, and begin to panic about the safety of temporarily sheltering in the Concession. They don't know what the only wonderful way to dispose of funds to protect wealth is - storing foreign exchange? Collecting gold? Hoarding goods? But foreign exchange has the risk of being frozen, the spot gold chips are too few, and the goods may be confiscated.</p>
<p>Funds are of course flowing to safe areas. But funds flowing to safe areas are not absolutely safe, permanently safe, only relatively safe, temporarily harmless. The absolute safety of funds is based on the foundation of national power being able to protect them. There has never been funds that are safe and harmless when separated from the protection of national power. Although funds are stored in safe areas, this is both a theory and a fact: the anxious state of general fund owners in Shanghai today is a reflection of this theory.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not really an absolutely safe zone for storing funds, but relying on the Chinese government's financial strength and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States and the Chinese government, funds have been relatively safe here for a long time. But the current relative safety may turn into absolute danger at any time. As long as the war in the South Pacific does not break out in a day, it is not dangerous because of the existence of China's financial strength and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States. However, no one can guarantee that the war in the South Pacific will not happen tomorrow, then no one can guarantee that it is not dangerous not to make arrangements for the funds in Shanghai in advance. In fact, once the war in the South Pacific breaks out, Japan will definitely seize the Concession, China's financial strength will also withdraw, and the friendly relations between Britain and the United States and China will also withdraw. The factors on which funds currently rely on for relative safety will no longer exist.</p>
<p>So, what is the only wonderful way to dispose of funds to protect wealth?</p>
<p>Although the Chinese government has not announced any wonderful ways to protect funds in the face of the current emergency, it has already opened up several major avenues for investing funds in the past. Unfortunately, these methods have not only been forgotten by general fund owners, but probably have never even been recognized. The author will introduce these several situations of investing funds as follows: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Securities: Debt Market Difficult to Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>The black market for public debt yesterday still did not break free from the hovering state. It was slightly smaller in the morning and slightly better again in the afternoon. It is difficult to rise and even more difficult to fall. It seems that this repeated brewing is due to the fact that the shorts are too crowded. In the future, because the short barrier is built higher and higher, I am afraid that it will be difficult to avoid repeating the cover of last year's rising tide, but it is only a matter of time. Yesterday's transaction, Xinfu is still buying non-stop, the period has been almost ten days, more absorption on every dip, never raising the price, the strength of the force can be imagined how the role, is unknown, and the future changes, that is in it. The rest, such as Shunchang Lianhe Dingkang, etc., are also mostly buying, but Tongkang has always sold, for many days, and the rest are suddenly entering and suddenly exiting, without any consistent role, which is not lacking, most of them are waiting for an opportunity to observe changes, waiting for the time to move only, yesterday's market results, only Grade A slightly better a dime, Grade D is unique because it is compared with the 26th of last month, less than eight dimes, Grade C and E are about a dime less, Grade B does not move, the total number of transactions is one hundred and forty-fifty thousand. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The stock transaction成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股一百股, the price is 19 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of the public utilities is still very dull, the price is trending downward, the transaction is sparse, and speculators and investors are unwilling to be active at this time, and rubber stocks are also soft in a dull way.</p>
<h3>Dividend for Water Company Stock</h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Water Company will hold its annual shareholders' meeting on March 27, and at the same time pay dividends for 1940, the 7% cumulative preference shares and 6.5% cumulative preference shares will each pay a next dividend of 3.5% and 3.25%, the last dividend for common shares, A pays 6.5% (including 4% of supplementary interest for 1939), equivalent to 26 shillings of British gold, plus an interim interest of 1%, for a total dividend of 7.5% for the whole year, for a total of 30 shillings of British gold, and also pays 1 shilling and 2 pence under the heading of off-boundary water supply and ship water supply, for a total payment of 31 shillings and 2 pence for the whole year, B pays 4.5%, equivalent to 10.8 pence of British gold (also including 2% of supplementary interest for 1939), plus an interim dividend of 5.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 2 pence of British gold, and also pays a dividend of 0.7 pence per share under the heading of off-boundary water supply and ship water supply, for a total payment of 1 shilling and 1.9 pence, C pays 5.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 1.2 pence of British gold, plus an interim of 6.5%, equivalent to 1 shilling and 3.6 pence of British gold.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Frustrated by Rumors, Difficult to Grasp Whether Long or Short</h3>
<p>The yarn market is fluctuating and unpredictable, with rumors flying everywhere, causing speculators to become disoriented. As a result, the market rises and falls suddenly, making it very difficult to grasp. Judging from the current state, the future of the yarn market is still uncertain. Because those who are bullish have sufficient inventory, if they are bearish, the margin increases, and the foreign exchange shrinks, speculative buyers will immediately come. Everyone is currently in a bullish position, hoping for the greatest gains. A surge upward, but prices have risen by dozens of yuan for two or three consecutive days. Many who are profiting are taking their profits and leaving the market. Once the chips are loosened, the reaction and fall are also rapid. Therefore, the current yarn market is like ants on a hot pot. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,424 yuan, and the low price is 1,386 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,391 yuan, gradually rising to 1,401 yuan.</p>
<p>When the Double Horse market opened in the morning, the bulls all came out in force, raising prices for each other, rising directly from 1,406 yuan to 1,424 yuan. Some who had made profits sold off, returning to 1,411 yuan. However, new buyers were numerous, and prices were seen to rise again. Unexpectedly, shortly before 11:45 AM, it was heard that there was another freeze on foreign exchange, and the margin fell. In an instant, the yarn market experienced a sudden downturn, and there were shouts of "sell" in the market. For a time, only selling was heard, with no transactions taking place, plunging straight to 1,386 yuan at closing. It is found that 6,700 bales were traded in half a day. The amount bought by each guild is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 895 Ningbo: 5</p>
<p>Counterparts: 5,800 Total: 6,700</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Cool</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly firmer, but actual consumption needs to develop. Therefore, the cotton market is still on a path of hesitation.</p>
<p>In the New York cotton market, traders are all taking a wait-and-see approach, so the market is flat and unremarkable. The result was a drop of two or three pounds compared to the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>In the Indian cotton market, prices rose first due to short covering, followed by speculative selling and a fall in cotton merchants' hedge selling. As a result, yesterday, including forecasts, prices rose slightly by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Transactions of imported cotton in Shanghai are cold and no one cares about them. Market prices have also slightly softened. If the current environment cannot be improved, the future of the cotton market is of great concern.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Factory Prices Rise in the Morning, Fall in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was uncertain, rising and falling suddenly, because traders' speculative minds were strong. They bought when prices rose and sold when prices fell. The market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, resulting in a flat outcome. The morning price of Fugui Dapeng fine cloth rose by 5 jiao per bolt, and fell back by 5 jiao in the afternoon. The morning price of Ewo coarse cloth rose by about 2.5 jiao, and also returned to the original price of the previous day in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged. Small amounts of hand goods were resold at slightly lower prices. More than 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Ningbo guild handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, etc. The Fujian guild handled 50 to 60 pieces of money cloth, kersey, and blue cloth, etc. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds handled more than 100 pieces of shirting, poplin, colored twill, and pongee, etc. Also, 300 pieces of cotton cloth are being shipped to Qingdao today (5th).</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: Initially flat, then rising, and then falling back at closing. The result was stable, without major fluctuations. 11-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 48.6 yuan. The current month for spot goods remains expensive, closing at 49.4 yuan. The morning price of Four Gentlemen kersey reached a high of 1.34 yuan, and the market fell back to 1.3275 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spring Wool Gabardine is the Most Popular</h3>
<p>Spring thin wool gabardine is very popular, and prices are rising daily. The inventory of imported goods from the East and West is extremely scarce. The genuine spring thin wool gabardine from this factory is also produced in small quantities. Yesterday, the wholesale price of the top-grade spring thin wool gabardine made in England was 70 yuan per yard, and the price of ordinary grades was around 60 yuan. The Italian-made 42,000-grade was 30 yuan. The top-grade Japanese goods were 43 or 44 yuan, the second-grade were 30 yuan, and the ordinary grades from this factory were all sold at 22 or 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward due to the relatively large number of importers. The guild set the price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar at 81 yuan at the local warehouse. Prices at outside warehouses fluctuated, initially from 80.6 yuan to 80.8 yuan, then falling back to 80.6 yuan to 80.5 yuan, resulting in a rise of 6 jiao. The price for March 10 contracts was 80.09 yuan to 80.8 yuan, and the price for March 20 contracts was 81.2 yuan to 81 yuan, rising 7 jiao. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark at the Western warehouse was 82.5 yuan to 83 yuan, then falling back to 82.6 yuan, an increase of 1.6 yuan. DY Mark at the Eastern warehouse was 79.5 yuan, rising 5 jiao. HX Mark at the Western warehouse was 79.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Soap Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The supply of soap is scarce and demand is high, and buying prices have risen again. Currently, Guben soap is selling for 37 yuan per case, with a small amount available on the market. Baixiangmao soap is 23 yuan per case, Huangxiangmao soap is 27 yuan per case, and Scissors soap is 28 yuan per case, all of which are higher than last week.</p>
<h3>Coal: Tongdeli White Coal - A Good Rise of More Than Ten Yuan -</h3>
<p>Tongdeli white coal, because there were too many old warehouse orders a month ago, the hoarding was congested, and it had fallen to 232 or 233 yuan, with no one accepting it. In recent days, due to the tense situation in Vietnam, there are rumors of more favorable news in the market, and the dark market and the open market have been competing, with a good rise of more than ten yuan. The company's listed price is still 245 yuan, and warehouse orders are also limited. Therefore, the shops on this street have also increased their prices, delivering screened lumps to customers for 260 yuan per ton, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Far East Situation is Gradually Becoming Tense: The British Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Gracefully: He Did Not Readily Reply to Various Questions, But Denied the Conclusion of a Military Alliance Between China and Britain: Accompanying Him Were the Ambassador's Wife and Attending Secretary</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, left Shanghai for Chongqing in September last year. In Chongqing, he met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for close talks. The Ambassador's wife left Shanghai for Hong Kong a few weeks ago to welcome her husband. The Ambassador left Chongqing by plane on the 25th of last month and stayed in Hong Kong for three days, taking the Ewo Company's Yuesheng round to Shanghai. The ship arrived in port at 3:30 PM yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. At that time, dozens of French Concession police officers and plainclothes detectives were densely deployed around the wharf, and the security was very tight. George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and representatives from various British institutions in Shanghai went to welcome him.</p>
<p>The Ambassador and His Wife Retained Their Former Demeanor</p>
<p>The Ambassador wore a blue-gray coat, a brown woolen overcoat, and yellow leather shoes. His complexion was ruddy and he was full of energy. He smoked a pipe, carried a white leather briefcase, and his attitude was calm and dignified. He shook hands and greeted Consul-General George and others one by one. Mrs. Kerr wore a white fox fur coat, a yellow dress, and a scarf that was also yellow. The silver-white hair was even more noticeable. At 3:45 PM, the Ambassador and his wife, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. George, took a special diplomatic car No. 16 and car No. 4426 and went straight to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Secretary Mackenzle also followed in another car.</p>
<p>Absolutely Denied the Sino-British Alliance</p>
<p>When Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and his wife stepped onto the wharf from the Yuesheng round, there were many reporters, especially Japanese reporters, who took photos of them and asked various questions. However, the Ambassador did not respond and refused to express his general views on the situation in China's wartime capital. However, when a reporter asked about the rumored plan for a military alliance between China and Britain, the British Ambassador said, "This is nonsense," and said that he enjoyed the journey very much.</p>
<p>His Stay in Shanghai Will Be Very Short</p>
<p>According to Mr. I. C. Mackenzle, the Ambassador's private secretary, only the Ambassador's wife and himself accompanied the Ambassador to Shanghai. Except for a short rest in Hong Kong, there were no delays on the way. The Ambassador's purpose in coming to Shanghai was to handle matters here and there were no other tasks. The Ambassador will have a short stay in Shanghai, which may be one month, but it has not been decided yet as he has just arrived. The Ambassador usually stays in Chongqing for half a year and in Shanghai for half a year. The Ambassador left Shanghai for Chongqing in August last year, which is almost half a year ago, so he came to Shanghai and went straight there to rest. However, it is heard that he has now decided to move to the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>Handle General Necessary Affairs</p>
<p>Many believe that the Ambassador's arrival is due to the increasingly urgent southward advance of Japan, and the United Kingdom must take appropriate measures. Secondly, British expatriates in the Far East are gradually evacuating, and there must be good steps. Thirdly, today, the upper</p>
<p>Photos of the British Ambassador Kerr and his wife arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>When reporters asked whether the rumors spread by the Japanese that the Ambassador would go to Manila were reliable, it was said that nothing was known yet. According to reports, the Ambassador was originally scheduled to leave Chongqing for Shanghai in early February, but it was rumored that his departure was delayed because the secret documents of Japanese Navy Admiral Koshirō Oikawa's southward advance were obtained by the Chinese army. The current situation in Shanghai, the sea situation, is of concern to the United Kingdom and the United States, which have the greatest interests. Mr. Kerr said that in order to understand the current situation in Shanghai, it is extremely necessary to come here from Chongqing. Although Mr. Kerr will not publicly express any opinions during his stay in Shanghai due to environmental constraints, diplomatic activities will inevitably be tense. In addition to instructing his subordinates with government diplomatic secrets to respond to contingencies, Mr. Kerr will also listen to reports from relevant officials to serve as a reference for the United Kingdom's decision-making policy.</p>
<h3>Women's Circles Prepare to Celebrate the March 8th International Women's Day</h3>
<p>March 8th is International Women's Day, the starting point for women in various countries around the world to fight for freedom, liberation, and equality. Women's groups in this city, such as the City Women's Association, Women's Association, Women's Temperance Union, Women's Mutual Aid Society, and China Women's Society, originally planned to convene women from all over the city to hold a grand celebration meeting. However, due to the special environment and the authorities' prohibition of gatherings, it was decided to suspend the formal expression. In addition to jointly publishing a letter to women in the city on this day, encouraging them to take on the national responsibility of saving the country and seeking survival, aiming for the ultimate victory, in the face of the era and the current responsibilities, and the meaning of "every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country."</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships in Eastern Zhejiang Have a Southward Appearance: Japanese Planes Bomb Haimen and Yongjia: Japanese Warships Fire Two Shells with Heavy Guns</h3>
<p>The details of the bombing of Haimen and Yongjia by more than 20 Japanese planes in Eastern Zhejiang the day before yesterday are unknown. According to information from the shipping industry in this port yesterday, a Japanese warship passing through Chuanshanyang sailed north to ×× place at 2:27 PM on the 2nd, firing heavy artillery at the shore, but only fired two shells, which fell into the mud and caused no losses. The warship then sailed north. Also, Ningbo issued a total of four air raid alerts over three days, and 16 Japanese planes passed through the area. According to news from the shipping industry, most of the Japanese warships in the Zhejiang Sea recently have been preparing to sail south, so their actions are frequent. Yesterday alone, a total of 13 Japanese warships of various sizes, including many transport ships, arrived at sea from Zhenhai in the west to Chuanshan and Xiangshan in the east. First, one Japanese warship arrived, followed by seven, and then four more. The batch of Japanese warships all sailed away one after another in the afternoon and were still moored on a certain island in Zhoushan to replenish supplies and had a southward appearance.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market Has No Restrictions: The Situation is Getting Worse: Not Only Exceeding the Limit, But Also Implementing Subsidies: All Parties Should Be Sincere in Suppressing Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The rice market has recently been shrouded in rumors again, and rice prices have continued to rise, seemingly determined to put the poor to death. It is found that the import of foreign rice this year is very strong. A total of 539,200 bags arrived in January, which has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that a total of 479,700 bags also arrived in February. The total number of bags arriving in two months is 1,019,000 bags. The first arrival of foreign rice this month was the Yuesheng round of Jardine Matheson yesterday, which brought 4,404 bags from Hong Kong. It is heard that the French company has five ships arriving in Shanghai within ten days, bringing a large batch of foreign rice. Therefore, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Discussions by All Parties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that representatives from the Public Concession Board of Directors, the French Concession Municipal Council, and the "Municipal Government," as well as the Japanese authorities, held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon (3rd) to discuss the serious situation in Shanghai caused by food shortages. This meeting was initiated and convened by "Mayor" Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Authorities</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the rice market transactions this morning (4th) not only exceeded the official maximum price set by the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee but also implemented subsidies, making the rice situation in Shanghai even worse. It is heard that the rice market transactions subsidize 1,000 yuan for every 100 bags, so the No. 2 tribute rice exceeds the official maximum price of the No. 1 tribute rice. Mr. Hederqui, Deputy Director-General of the Public Concession Board of Directors, declined to comment on this when he met with reporters this morning. It is said that the Public Concession Board of Directors is only in the position of supervising the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee composed of major rice merchants. There are rumors in the market that the relevant responsible parties have discussed steps to deal with the current crisis, but the alleged meeting between Mr. He and representatives of the committee this morning has not been confirmed. It is heard that the Portuguese round Pluto has recently arrived in Shanghai with more than 10,000 bags of tribute rice, and it is estimated that the current rice stock in this city is more than 1.5 million bags, equivalent to more than 2 million dan.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Notice</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Industry Association issued a notice to its members yesterday, saying that rice prices in this city are soaring and increasing without end. In order to supply the market, fellow traders have to purchase goods to meet the market demand. If we want to keep the limit price, we have no goods to buy. If we want to buy goods, we must endure the pain of exceeding the limit. Not only is the sacrifice too great, but it also violates the authorities' arrangements. If we hesitate and do not enter the market, there will be no goods to supply the market, and the people will be panic-stricken. The people's food and public order are all related. Our fellow traders are in extreme difficulty. In addition to reporting the above situation to the authorities of the two concessions truthfully and seeking remedial measures quickly, we hereby notify you and hope that all fellow traders will check and take the overall situation into consideration. In this tense period, take into account the livelihood of the common people as the most important thing. Whether it is wholesale or retail, we must strictly abide by the limit price and must not exceed it in the slightest. Wait for the authorities' instructions to handle the matter in order to maintain the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>National Medical Civilian Hospital Asks for Help from Society: A Monthly Shortfall of 4,000 Yuan: Hoping for Donations from All Parties</h3>
<p>The National Medical Civilian Hospital's medical services are developing day by day, so the economic aspect cannot offset income and expenditure. At a recent board meeting, it was said that the hospital's funding, in addition to the Zhenwei Association's monthly grant of 2,000 yuan, the remainder was income from outpatient registration fees and hospitalization fees, amounting to 600 to 700 yuan per month, while the amount of expenditure was about 7,000 yuan per month, a monthly shortfall of about 4,000 yuan. And there are 70,000 people treated each year. All the funds have been used up, and the hospital's bedding was originally insufficient, and it has been damaged over time, making it more difficult to maintain. How to add more is also a problem. In addition, three executive directors are missing and should be re-elected, and Director Lu Bolong proposed adding an obstetrics department. After discussions by the board of directors, although there are solutions, it is still hoped that enthusiastic people in society will do their best to support and maintain the hospital so that it will not be ruined and create benefits for poor patients.</p>
<h3>Fangdan Case: Continued Hearing Today</h3>
<p>The Consular Court is scheduled to continue the ninth hearing of the case of four Chinese landlords suing the Public Concession Board of Directors for collecting Fangdan property tax at 2:30 PM today in the conference hall on the second floor of the Public Concession Board of Directors. Because the scope involved in the case is very wide, it is not easy for both parties to end the provision of evidence. However, Judge Lang stated last time that he hoped that both parties could end the evidence part in court today, so it is expected that today will be the last investigation court, and the fierce debate between the two parties will also exceed the previous several times. According to a certain landlord yesterday, about 60% of the land in the concession belongs to Tao Deed land, and 40% belongs to Fangdan land. Since foreigners have no land ownership in Chinese territory, those who hold Tao Deed land only have the right to permanent lease of the land and must pay rent and taxes to the Public Concession Board of Directors. However, Fangdan land is different, because those who hold Fangdan land have ownership of the land and pay a certain amount of land tax to the Chinese government. Now, if the Public Concession Board of Directors wants to collect Fangdan land tax, it violates Chinese land laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>The Board of Directors Will Discuss Today: Measures to Reduce Electricity: Based on the Plan Proposed by the Power Company: And Assist in Obtaining Coal Transport Vessels</h3>
<p>The Committee on Studying the Problem of Current Supply organized by the Public Concession Board of Directors convened a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the Public Concession Board of Directors to discuss the plan proposed by the power company to reduce the supply of current and how the Public Concession Board of Directors can assist the power company in obtaining vessels for transporting coal and gasoline so that the power company can have a sufficient supply of electricity. The results of the meeting will have to wait until the Board of Directors meeting at 4:30 PM this afternoon before a decision can be made. If the electricity reduction measures are implemented gradually, it is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles in this city will not encounter major impacts as a result. It is heard that Chinese and Japanese-owned yarn factories have already begun to reduce work by 20% to 50%.</p>
<p>Adequate Supply for Proper Use</p>
<p>According to inquiries with the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the company's coal reserves can now meet the needs for three months. However, if transportation can be facilitated and a large amount of coal can be obtained, there is no need to worry about the shortage of electricity supply. Most of the coal needed by the company comes from North China and Cambodia India. Now, due to transportation difficulties, a plan to reduce the supply of current has to be made, but it is hoped that citizens can save unnecessary electricity consumption so that the current can be fully supplied for proper use. According to inquiries with a certain industrial circle, if the power company lacks coal sources and reduces the supply of current, some factories will be affected as a result. However, some factories that use electric heat can switch to gas, but the cost is more expensive.</p>
<p>Sufficient Oil Reserves in this City for Several Months</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai News, regarding the possibility of a shortage of gasoline in Shanghai, an employee of Mobil Oil Company told reporters yesterday (3rd) that the company does not intend to limit the amount of any type of oil. He admitted that there is currently a shortage of lubricating oil (i.e., diesel) in this port and could not say when new supplies would arrive from overseas. The fear of a possible shortage of gasoline yesterday caused a large number of car dealers and transportation companies in this port to purchase large quantities. However, according to investigations, the gasoline reserves in this port are still sufficient for several months. According to other sources, the so-called possible shortage of gasoline is a rumor spread by speculators, hoping to take the opportunity to raise oil prices in order to achieve their hoarding and profiteering desires. The shortage of lubricating oil has lasted for too long and will indeed cause a blow to the transportation industry in this port, but some quarters believe that new goods will arrive by the end of March.</p>
<p>Industrial Circles Pay Attention to the Amount of Reduction</p>
<p>According to the report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Office of the Public Concession Board of Directors in February, the Shanghai Electric Power Company announced the possibility of reducing the supply of current at the end of last month. Although the details have not been officially announced, this matter has attracted the attention of the industrial circles. According to several factories, if the amount of current supply is not reduced by much, they can still cope with it. If it is reduced by a large amount suddenly, there will be difficulties. Factories such as glass factories, thermos bottle factories, light bulb factories, and copper rolling factories that use diesel oil are expected to experience difficulties due to the lack of oil supply. As for factories that use steam, they are also worried about the shortage of fuel. There are 30 factories that used to be silk factories, but now they have been converted into warehouses, iron factories, textile factories, and dyeing factories due to the lack of profits.</p>
<p>Spot Coal Has Been Manipulated</p>
<p>Because a large amount of coal in Shanghai is being manipulated, the spot chips in the market have suddenly decreased, and people's hearts are firm. Yesterday, the market price of coal was actually driven up. Recently, the Shanghai Electric Power Company intends to reduce the daily electricity supply compared to the past due to a shortage of coal reserves, so some people who are blinded by profit have taken the opportunity to move and control a large amount of hoarding, which is not the right thing to do. Now, the market price of coal balls is 9 yuan per dan (100 city catties), and the lives of the middle and lower classes will become more and more difficult. According to news from the coal industry, the Japanese merchant ship Mitiren Maru transported a large amount of Hongji coal dross to the port at 7:00 AM yesterday. It is learned that the coal dross was ordered by two major coal ball factories for use on the market. It is hoped that it will be sold off as soon as possible to stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>Motor Electricity Has Been Restricted</p>
<p>The Public Concession Board of Directors has recently issued a notice, stating that due to the shortage of fuel and the difficulty of delivery, from now until the date of another notice, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will not accept any requests for connecting motor electricity, whether it is newly installed or expanded. The Bureau has agreed to this.</p>
<h3>Preparedness Will Be Implemented for the Anniversary of the Death of the Premier: The Measures Have Not Yet Been Announced</h3>
<p>The 12th of this month is the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China. The authorities of the two concessions will implement preparedness in various parts of the concessions on that day. As for the specific preparedness measures to be adopted, police officers refused to comment yesterday, but said that terrorists within the concessions have been very active recently, so the authorities may adopt "unexpected measures." At the same time, various Chinese groups have formulated a number of commemorative measures for the anniversary of the death of the Premier, and various institutions, banks, schools, and shops will also fly flags at half-mast on that day. All entertainment venues will suspend entertainment, and the public will silently mourn together.</p>
<h3>Birthday of the Late President of Czechoslovakia Today: Celebrated by Czech Expatriates</h3>
<p>Today is the 91st birthday of the late President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of the Czechoslovak Republic. Czech expatriates in this city are holding commemorations to show their celebration. Masaryk was the leader of Czechoslovakia before World War I and traveled around the world, fighting for the national revival movement. His footprints almost covered Italy, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Russia, China, Japan, the United States, and other countries. As a result, various countries recognized Czechoslovakia as a member of the Allied Powers. After Germany, Austria, and other countries surrendered, Czechoslovakia became a republic, and Masaryk was elected as the first president. He served for 17 years. At the age of 85, he retired due to fatigue and Edvard Beneš succeeded him. Masaryk died a year before the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Masaryk was not only the leader of Czechoslovakia but also one of the great men in the world. Czech expatriates in this city said that he was very similar to Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary leader of China. The Nazis did not allow Czechs in the German-occupied areas to hold any celebrations or commemorations and did not allow Czech newspapers to mention Masaryk's name.</p>

<h3>High Second Branch President Xu Weizhen Abducted Yesterday - Encountered Bandits on the Way Back to Hualong Road Apartment - Wife and Driver Were Forced Out of the Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around six o'clock, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred on Hualong Road in the French Concession. The kidnapped person was Xu Weizhen, President of the High Second Branch. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dusk After Finishing Official Business - Returning Home by Car</p>
<p>Xu Weizhen, courtesy name Xuying, President of the High Second Branch on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession, is sixty-two years old, from Tongxiang, Zhejiang. His residence in Shanghai is at No. 52, Yang's Apartment, No. 30 Hualong Road, French Concession. He routinely takes the branch's official car (Concession Permit No. 2262) to the branch office at 9:00 AM and returns home at 5:00 or 6:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon, his wife, Wang, a Suzhou native, fifty-six years old, went to the court for business. After Xu finished his official duties at 6:00 PM, he and his wife Wang took the branch car to return home.</p>
<p>Xu Weizhen's Recent Photo</p>
<p>Bandits Waiting in Ambush - Car and People Taken</p>
<p>As the car was about to arrive at the entrance of his residence and was stopping, five bandits dressed in Chinese attire, who had been waiting on the side of the road, suddenly rushed out in front of the car. Three bandits brandished pistols, threatening and intimidating, forbidding anyone to make a sound. The remaining bandits opened the car door and told Wang to get out. After Wang got out of the car, four bandits successively got into the car, held Xu hostage, and poked his waist with a gun barrel. Another bandit drove the chauffeur out of the car. The bandits also got into the car, accelerated, and drove north, turning onto Avenue Joffre and speeding westward.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives - Arrived at the Scene to Investigate</p>
<p>After his wife watched the car speeding away without a trace, she returned home and telephoned the French Concession police station, which immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. The police station also notified the Public Concession police authorities to assist in the search. At that time, the car the bandits were originally in (Concession Permit No. 2015) was also closely following Xu's car.</p>
<p>Long-Term Legal Career - Highly Reputed</p>
<p>Xu holds a Doctor of Law degree from Indiana University in the United States. During the late Qing Dynasty, he worked for the Ministry of Posts and Communications and later served as a judicial officer at the Naval Department. After the Republic of China was established, he served as a judge of the Supreme Court, a lecturer in law at National Peking University, the Chief of the Higher Court of Shanxi Province, the Secretary-General of the Committee for Investigating Legal Rights, a professor of law at Soochow University, a counselor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, and a counselor of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. He is currently the President of the High Second Branch of Jiangsu and Shanghai. He is known for his impartiality and integrity and enjoys a high reputation. Since this case occurred, people in society have been astonished that Xu, as a judicial officer of the city, was actually abducted. Therefore, everyone is paying close attention.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consul General's Office - Busy Processing Passports</h3>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai receives 400 applications for immigration passports each month. Some are approved, and some are rejected. One of the reasons for the surge in the number of requests for immigration passports is that Shanghai has seen a large influx of refugees from Europe in recent years. It is reported that in addition to issuing immigration passports, the U.S. Consulate also handles the issuance of tourist passports and student passports, as well as passports for travel to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Two More Russian Ships - Arrived in Shanghai - The "Simairne" is Nearing Completion of Repairs - Scheduled to Depart for Little Luzon with Cargo</h3>
<p>After two Soviet ships arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok last month, they are currently undergoing repairs in Shanghai. According to Hongyun Shipping Agency, the agent for Russian ships, two more Soviet ships will arrive in port from Vladivostok in the next day or two. They will also remain in the Wanguo Shipyard dock in Pudong for inspection and repairs. Neither of these cargo ships is carrying passengers or cargo. One of the two ships is named "Sovet," with a deadweight tonnage of 1,385 tons, and the other is named "Maxim Gorky," with a deadweight tonnage of 2,256 tons. For three and a half years, the arrival of Russian ships in Shanghai had been absent. Since the "Simairne" first arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of last month, followed by the "Komiles," and now the "Sovet" and "Maxim Gorky," which are expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow, the number has reached four. The "Simairne," which first arrived in Shanghai, is nearing completion of repairs. This ship has a deadweight tonnage of 2,154 tons and is scheduled to leave Shanghai around the 10th or 11th of this month, loading cargo and heading to Little Luzon. The "Komiles" has a deadweight tonnage of 2,255 tons. The date of its departure and destination after the completion of repairs are yet to be determined. When asked whether the shipyards in Vladivostok were too busy working for the Russian fleet to attend to merchant ships, which were thus opportunistically sailing to Shanghai for repairs, the reporter did not receive detailed information, but it is known that after the repairs are completed, the ships will gradually join the Far East shipping operations, carrying cargo between Shanghai and various ports in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Alcott - Denies Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Famous radio reporter Alcott published an article in the Continental Daily yesterday, denying rumors that he would be withdrawing from Shanghai. He stated, "People in Shanghai have been widely spreading rumors that the author plans to withdraw from Shanghai. The number of inquiries from radio listeners has reached several per day. My boss, fearing that I would leave Shanghai, paid me my monthly salary a week in advance. In fact, I currently have no plans to leave Shanghai. Apart from continuing my broadcasting career, I have no definite plans for the future. Last year, I had hoped for a three or four-week vacation, but this plan has now changed. For three years, except for Christmas, New Year, and the flood, I have been broadcasting on the radio regardless of the weather, without interruption."</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications - Shanghai Branch Relocates - New Address on Jing'an Temple Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications has recently leased the building at No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road, at the intersection of Moore Road, as the original address on Avenue Joffre was insufficient for office space. It will relocate to the new location today. The Savings and Trust Department of the bank, which was originally located at the intersection of Amherst Avenue and Route Voyron, will also move to the new location on Jing'an Temple Road on the same day. The branch of the bank on Avenue Joffre will continue to operate as usual at its original address, No. 889 Avenue Joffre.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Yiji Charity Association - Plans to Expand Dining Halls at Peace Hotel - Yu Qiaqing and Others Enthusiastically Help the Poor</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yiji Charity Association has been providing free meals and porridge for over three months, and has been able to maintain operations thanks to the enthusiastic donations of benefactors from all walks of life. In particular, Yu Qiaqing alone donated 100,000 yuan, benefiting the poor in no small measure. The association is chaired by Yu Qiaqing and Huang Jinrong, with Fan Kaitai as the executive director and Cheng Xiwen as the general director. Recently, there are plans to cancel the porridge distribution points and expand the free meal locations to twenty, each costing 10,000 yuan per month, totaling</p>
<h3>Chinese Guerrillas - Lay Mines in the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese side has announced that Chinese guerrillas, acting on orders from the authorities, are constantly laying mines in the Yangtze River. The Japanese Navy is continuing to clear them. No less than five floating mines were removed last week. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that ordinary merchant shipping along the Yangtze River is entirely safe. Furthermore, the Japanese Navy is implementing a blockade, searching 4,600 sailboats last week. Among them, twenty were carrying firearms and ammunition, which were confiscated, costing 200,000 yuan. The locations of the free meal distribution points that have already been determined include one at the Cotton Cloth Association at No. 406 Route des Pères, and one at the Tianhou Palace Refugee Relief Branch, No. 40. Others are being selected. At a time when the cost of living is high and rice prices are soaring, this move by the association is truly commendable. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously, so that the association's work can be sustained permanently.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Students Save Candy Money - Donate to the New Pu Yu Orphanage</h3>
<p>Xiao Yaorong and other students from the Muse Primary School in this city, seeing the reports in this newspaper about the financial difficulties of the New Pu Yu Orphanage, have been saving their candy money to make donations. The willingness of young students to do good deeds is a testament to the greatness of human compassion. The orphanage has received considerable donations from all walks of life, but it is still far from its goal. It is hoped that donations will continue. The donations received yesterday are listed below: Xiao Yaorong 4 yuan, Chen Wenrong 3 yuan, Chen Eping 2 yuan, Lin Shouyuan 2 yuan, Chen Shuqiao 1 yuan, Hu Zhenhua 1 yuan (all students from Muse Primary School), Zhu Ren 50 yuan, Zhang Xinhang 30 yuan, Mingji 20 yuan, anonymous 10 yuan, Ge Li'an 2 yuan, Hou Yujian 2 yuan. We would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the orphaned children of the orphanage. The location for donating goods to the orphanage is in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<h3>Cotton Products Sold to Other Ports - Exemption from Registration and Approval for Sale</h3>
<p>In order to expedite the procedure for applying for a certificate of Chinese goods for cotton products sold to other ports, starting from March 1st, the registration and approval procedures will be waived, and the procedure will be revised as follows: (1) Starting from March 1st, when cotton products are sold to other ports, six copies of the application form must be filled out to apply for a certificate of Chinese goods, and the sales receipts from the yarn factory or cloth factory used as raw materials must be attached. On the back of the receipt, a table should be used to indicate the date (i.e., the date of applying for the certificate for the finished product), the quantity of raw materials used (yarn indicated in kilograms, cloth indicated in pieces), and the remaining quantity. If the entire quantity is not used at once, after verifying the remaining quantity, the original receipt will be returned when the certificate is issued for continued use next time (when continuing to use, a table must still be used to indicate the quantity used on a certain date and whether there is any remaining quantity). After the remaining quantity is used up, the receipt will be cancelled and kept on file. (2) Those who have registered before and have not finished using will continue to have their receipts approved for sale until they are used up. (3) For those who applied for registration before March 1st but have not completed the registration procedure, the registration documents will be returned after verification, and the procedure will be carried out according to Article 1. Those that are still in the hands of the guild and have not been verified and transferred will be directly returned by the guild.</p>
<h3>French Inspector Lafon - Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>After French Inspector Lafon of the French Concession police station died on March 2nd, the coffin was sealed at Guangci Hospital at 8:20 AM yesterday morning. After a memorial mass was held at Saint-Trobe Church on Rue Lutetia at 8:30 AM, the funeral procession proceeded along Route des Pères and Rue Sapeur to the Lujiawan Cemetery. Two small teams of Chinese and Vietnamese policemen held wreaths as the vanguard of the procession. The Superintendent of the French Concession Police and the bereaved family closely followed the coffin. Those who participated in the funeral included representatives from the French Consul General, the French Army, the French Municipal Council, the French Concession Police, special patrol officers, the fire brigade, and representatives from the Public Concession Police. After the coffin arrived at the cemetery, the Superintendent of the French Concession Police delivered a eulogy and presented a silver medal on behalf of the French Consul General.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army - Fundraising Nearing Target</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army's fundraising campaign, as of yesterday, has received donations that are very close to the total of 175,000 yuan. Those who wish to donate can send their donations to the Salvation Army headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House.</p>
<h3>Five Teachings Introduction - Deadline to Pick Up Books</h3>
<p>Last June, Mr. Feng Bing and Mr. Liang held five days of lectures on the Five Teachings in honor of their mother's birthday, and at the same time, they distributed pre-booked tickets to the listeners for picking up the Introduction to the Five Teachings book. Since the lectures on the Five Teachings and the publication of the Introduction to the Five Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam last year, there have been many people who have picked up the books with their tickets, but there are also those who have not. On the other hand, the number of schools, organizations, and individuals who have requested the books is even greater, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, the period for picking up books with tickets must come to an end before the books can be distributed to others. The deadline for picking up books with tickets is extended to the end of March. After this deadline, the tickets will be void, so that all remaining books can be transferred to those who love to read and request them. The location for picking up the books is at the Tongren Law Office, Feng Jishentang Accounting Office, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Museum Road.</p>
<h3>Woodhead's Impressions of Nanjing</h3>
<p>Critic Woodhead, in his edited "Eastern Miscellany," published a travelogue of Nanjing, which reads: "The author traveled to Nanjing in March 1940 and revisited Nanjing in early February this year, taking advantage of rest and leave. Before taking a car, one must be approved by the Japanese military. Each person must submit two photos. Although there is no fee, one must fill out two lengthy forms, which takes at least five days, which is very inconvenient. In fact, the Japanese do not welcome foreigners to stay in Nanjing for too long. I requested to reside for three months, but the Japanese only allowed me to stay for ten days.</p>
<p>Today's Nanjing is not much different from Nanjing before November. Zhongshan Road has been slightly repaired, but it is still enough to damage the wheel springs of cars. On the small streets, there are cannonball marks and bomb craters everywhere, making it necessary to take detours. Some of the government offices are still in ruins. The city gate inspection is extremely strict. In addition to rigorous searches, Chinese and Japanese civilians must get out of the car and take off their hats to salute the Japanese soldiers. Only after walking through the city gate can they board the car again. The British and American governments have repeatedly made it clear to the Japanese authorities that they cannot tolerate British and American people saluting Japanese soldiers. However, this matter is still a cause of friction with the Japanese in Nanjing. Japanese sentries have even forced senior British and American naval personnel to get out of the car and walk into the city. The most troublesome procedure is at the Xiaguan city gate, where foreigners frequently enter and exit because of the Jardine Matheson factory, which is extremely inconvenient. The most friction occurs at the city gate where foreigners enter and exit to go to the golf course.</p>
<p>From today's perspective, Nanjing has completely become a Japanese military garrison, which is much worse than when I visited in March 1940. Japanese soldiers, Japanese sailors, Japanese flags, and Japanese military vehicles can be seen everywhere and at all times in the streets. Important buildings are guarded by Japanese soldiers, and many large properties have been requisitioned by the Japanese military. Foreign merchants in Nanjing have no business to speak of. The larger factories still retain a minimal number of staff to oversee the assets. Foreign-owned industries on the banks of the river are still under Japanese military occupation. The only foreign trade that survives now is a small amount of kerosene and cigarettes. Daily necessities such as flour, sugar, matches, butter, and coal are extremely scarce in Nanjing. Fees for electricity, telephone, and tap water must be paid with military scrip. There are many wild chickens in the mountains near the city, so people are allowed to shoot them. Nanjing has lost its former status as an educational center. The universities only retain a few Chinese and Western staff to guard the buildings.</p>
<p>The author spoke with a Japanese soldier who said that the appearance of Nanjing was very much like a Japanese military garrison. The officer said that the troops maintaining security were still in training and that the Japanese garrison could withdraw "soon." However, the author, seeing the Japanese military's requisition of real estate and attempts to seize foreign-owned properties, did not think it looked like they were planning a short stay.</p>
<p>It has been over a year since the Japanese officially declared the opening of the Yangtze River below Nanjing, but there has been no intention to implement it. Today, the only foreign ships that can sail past Nanjing are the American gunboats in the Yangtze River. The large ones travel between Shanghai and Wuhu once a month, passing through Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The American gunboats that sail to Hankou only come once every three months and must be accompanied by Japanese warships for "protection." Everyone is surprised why foreigners are not very enthusiastic about traveling to Nanjing. In fact, if the procedures were not so cumbersome, foreigners would not be so hesitant. In addition to a permit, I was also required to have a cholera vaccination certificate, a smallpox certificate, and other cumbersome procedures. Therefore, although Nanjing has beautiful mountains and scenery, it cannot arouse the interest of foreigners."</p>

<h3>British and Japanese Candidates for Municipal Council - May Be Announced This Week - Rumor That the Japanese Side Will Nominate Five More - British and Americans Hope to Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council elections are less than a month away, but the British and Japanese residents of the Public Concession have not yet "made a decision" regarding the nomination of candidates for the Municipal Council. As of yesterday, neither side had nominated candidates. The American residents previously nominated Oliver and Mills to participate in this year's election through the American Residents Association. The Japanese side remained silent yesterday morning regarding the question of when the election would begin, but hinted that the Japanese election campaign might begin this week. It is believed that the Japanese side will follow last year's practice and nominate five candidates, hoping that all five will be elected. The British and Americans, however, hope to maintain the status quo, that is, to maintain the gentleman's agreement of nine British directors, two American directors, and one Japanese director. The British residents are expected to nominate candidates this week and hold a primary election before the 15th of this month. McDonald, an independent British candidate who participated in the Municipal Council election last year, told reporters yesterday morning that he might participate in the election again this year, but he has not yet made a decision and will not announce it until the day before the deadline for submitting candidates (March 16).</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Sues Resident for House Tax</h3>
<p>The Fang case has attracted attention from all walks of life. Now, the Municipal Council is in dispute with Mr. Shan Yuhua, a lawyer at No. 118 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, over house tax in the First Special District Court. Lawyer Shan Yuhua has resided in Dazhong Lane for many years. The house he lives in is old, so the landlord has not increased the rent. However, Shan opposes the Municipal Council's collection of taxes based on the proportion of rent increases in the lane and insists on paying taxes based on the landlord's rent receipt. Therefore, the Municipal Council refused to accept the house tax for last winter and this spring. Shan, based on the rent receipt, calculated the amount of tax and sent a check to the Municipal Council. Although the Municipal Council accepted it, they claimed that it was still 20 yuan and 4 jiao short. Shan argued that the Municipal Council has always based its tax collection on rent receipts, and many residents in the lane have not had their rent increased, and they all pay taxes based on rent receipts. Therefore, Shan opposed the Municipal Council's actions, leading to litigation. Yesterday, Judge Guo of the First Special District Court opened a civil court and summoned both parties. The arguments were fierce. The court stated that although both parties had their own arguments, the facts were clear. The trial was concluded, and a verdict was scheduled for the 8th.</p>
<h3>Public Buses and Trucks - Crushed Two Children to Death - Families Searched - Repeated Admonitions</h3>
<p>On Yunnan Road and Zhifu Road in the Public Concession, at around 5:00 PM yesterday, a student, about fourteen or fifteen years old, wearing a blue cloth gown, with a shaved head, and a Jinghai Primary School badge hanging on his lapel, was walking through the area when a truck sped past. The truck failed to avoid him, causing him to be knocked to the ground, his skull crushed, and he died on the spot. Chinese police officers from Laozha No. 3400 arrived, recorded the vehicle number of the truck, and sent the body to Renji Hospital for examination at the coroner's office. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a No. 10 public bus (vehicle number 1503) was speeding west on Connaught Road at the intersection of Tokyo Road when a Ningbo child named Zhang Jiaying (eight years old) suddenly tried to cross the road from north to south. The bus failed to avoid him and knocked him down. His whole body rolled under the wheels, his brains splattered, his abdomen was ruptured, and his intestines spilled out. The scene was too gruesome to bear. Police officers at the post rushed to the scene and urgently summoned an ambulance. The child was sent to Baolong Hospital, but due to his severe injuries, he had already died by the time he arrived at the hospital.</p>
<h3>Waiter Training at the Dahua Hotel</h3>
<p>The Dahua Hotel, a giant in the Hong Kong hotel industry, is excellently equipped and pays attention to the training of its waiters. The current waiters have all received education above the secondary level. Its daily customers are mostly domestic and foreign dignitaries and celebrities. Because of the influence of the hotel's environment, its staff are extraordinary. Recently, the hotel has been recruiting a number of waiters aged between 16 and 18 with a junior high school education level in Shanghai. The treatment after being hired is excellent. During the training period, in addition to daily work, university professors are specially hired to teach various basic knowledge. The registration office is at Huimin Company, No. 451 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Small Suitcase Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>At 8:45 AM yesterday, someone left a black suitcase in the third-class compartment of a No. 1 tramcar near the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lutetia. It is probably a student's schoolbag. Ticket seller No. 595 is responsible for keeping it. The owner can claim it from the tram company.</p>
<h3>Robbed Men's Overcoats Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>At 9:00 PM on February 26th, Chinese police officer No. 813 of the French Concession police station encountered an armed robber and two accomplices on Rue Bourgeat as they were stripping an overcoat from a Chinese man. He immediately arrested them. The robber, named He Erchang, also known as Wang Ailin, 24 years old, residing in Shanghai 4, confessed that in February this year, he and two accomplices who are still at large robbed pedestrians of their clothes multiple times on Rue Bourgeat, Rue Maignan, and Rue Kraetzer. Detectives from the French Concession police station are displaying four men's overcoats at various police stations. Three of them have not been claimed by their owners. The owners are requested to see the newspaper and go to the detective office of the French Concession police station at No. 22 Rue Sherva Litzky to claim them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory reported at 4:30 PM yesterday that Shandong and its surroundings were sunny and cold, with fog and southeast to southwest winds. It was sunny and warmer here, with fog in the morning and north to east winds. In the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island, it was cloudy with strong northeast monsoon winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 50.2 degrees and the lowest was 28.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 44.6 degrees and the lowest was 39.4 degrees.</p>

<h3>Meat Eaters Are Base</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>"Meat eaters are base," is truly a bit "inexplicable." However, based on sentiment, perhaps it is because of "killing."</p>
<p>Of course, this "meat" specifically refers to: pigs, cattle, sheep... certainly not people!</p>
<p>But now there are actually "cannibals." Not only are there some, but there are also many.</p>
<p>Dogs are used to eating feces and do not feel the stench of feces. People have been "eating people" for a long time and do not feel that "cannibals" are "eating people." This is quite in line with the principles of "nature"...</p>
<p>"If you don't want people to know, don't do it." "Eating people" may be "natural," but the "bloody smell" and "bones left over" are still easily discovered by others, leading to resistance. Appeals to lower rice prices and requests to sanction hoarders are ironclad proof! (Although the result of appeals and requests may be "only hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but not seeing anyone come down.")</p>
<p>Therefore, "meat eaters" are more than just "base"!</p>
<h3>Don't Be Fooled by the "Superior Person" Anymore</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>"One must endure bitterness to become a superior person."</p>
<p>This proverb is often what kind and honest elders use to advise those restless young fellows. However, sometimes it becomes a "spiritual medicine" for people to comfort themselves. As a result, all the "hidden tricky problems" contained within it are ignored.</p>
<p>I think someone will definitely ask, "This is clearly a 'golden saying,' how can you arbitrarily speak nonsense and overturn the teachings of the ancients?" True, this is an "ancient teaching," but could it be that ancient teachings are absolutely without error? I believe there is probably no one who dares to answer that it is "absolutely" without error.</p>
<p>Well then, since there is error, we must find the root cause of the error in this, and we can no longer let it continue to be wrong as before it was discovered, or even keep silent and not say a word. Because in the past we ourselves have been deceived, we must tell others the secrets within it, so that they can awaken and strive to truly be a person.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that the "golden saying" "One must endure bitterness to become a superior person" is an outright self-deception, and "ghost talk" that tells people to only "be content with their lot" and "resign themselves to fate," and wipes out people's enterprising thoughts. And for many years, society has been ruled by the feudal system under these two sentences, causing thousands of miserable people to be unable to turn over; at the same time, they don't even think about turning over. This is truly the same as using "fatalism" to deceive people.</p>
<p>However, things are not that simple. Fatalists tell you that your own "fate" is bitter, so you should be bitter for life, and don't think about this or that anymore. In this way, you are quite simply destined to be a slave forever. But "One must endure bitterness to become a superior person" goes a step further. You might as well be a slave first, and it will be good to turn over in the future, but the condition for turning over is that you must first be like a beast of burden, otherwise, you shouldn't even think about becoming a "superior person" in the future! As a result, many people are deceived into being obedient, and they are even willing to die like beasts of burden without a word of complaint.</p>
<p>However, our deceived ones seem to be a bit too honest. Look: the exploited friends are now "inferior" people, with "superior" people high above; but if the inferior people climb to the position of superior people (but this is a minority among minorities), then there are still countless masses under them, the only difference is that you yourself have risen.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, the unfolding of the tragedy lies in this one root cause: because there are superior people, there are also inferior people, so everyone wants to be a superior person, so the inferior people desperately want to climb up, push, and attack. As a result, it turns into a struggle between inferior people and superior people. In this way, the entire society, the entire world, and the entire humanity today are forever being twisted in this vortex, unable to find peace or stillness.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to appeal, we are not willing to be inferior people, but at the same time we absolutely don't want to be superior people, but hope that people in this world are all equal and mutually beneficial, and are people who do not distinguish between superior and inferior! And our work today should be to thoroughly transform the current social system where there are people above people, and even dozens of layers of superior people!</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Written by Lü Sha</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"There's a way!" He ran up the thirty-odd steps, panting like an old ox that had just plowed three acres of land. "Let's go see Mrs. Yuan first!"</p>
<p>He grabbed Begonia's plump hand, as if he wanted her to leave immediately.</p>
<p>"But is Commander Yuan here?" Begonia asked, not quite daring to believe it.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter whether Third Master is here or not," Zhao Si grabbed a torn black呢 hat, held it in his left hand, and fanned himself like a fan, and his fat face was indeed sweating from exhaustion. "Mrs. Hu here has dealings with the wives of Governor Ma's secretaries. You just need to see her!"</p>
<p>Begonia felt that what he said seemed very reasonable, and he had indeed been a little dizzy from the harassment of those hooligans just now, so he didn't have time to think about anything else, and really stood up and followed Zhao Si. It wasn't until he found Yuan Baofan's golden house, and met Ji Zhaoxiong, one of Yuan Baofan's most trusted orderlies, at the door, that he felt that he had come too rashly.</p>
<p>"Ah! This matter may be a little difficult." Ji Zhaoxiong first let Begonia and Zhao Si into the reception room, listened to them explain the purpose of their visit, and then frowned his triangular eyebrows, and from his pair of deep-set eye sockets, sent out two strange sharp rays of light, turned around a few times on Begonia's face, and slowly said, "Hasn't the Madam here never met you before? Boss Wu.... But, it's really to your credit that you were able to find out!"</p>
<p>"I ran for half a day to find out." Zhao Si said as if very proud, "Now that we're here, please help us ask!"</p>
<p>Ji Zhaoxiong's face still revealed a very embarrassed expression. "You don't know! This Madam's temper is really very different from the three in Beijing!" He lowered his voice, deliberately pretending to be very confidential, and said, "The Commander is also a little afraid of her. And what she hates most is opera singers. In the past, when the Commander was in Beijing, didn't he invite many of you good actors to his house to sing and drink every day? But it's not okay here! He simply doesn't dare to bring in unrelated people....”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, Begonia was almost disappointed and about to leave.</p>
<p>"But, the friendship between our boss and Third Master and Seventh Master is somewhat different from others, they should know that inside too!" Zhao Si still refused to give up this avenue. "Please help us, Brother, and try to see if it works?"</p>
<p>The orderly still shook his head. (46)</p>
<h3>A Day's Diary</h3>
<p>— Unemployed Person</p>
<p>I got up very early and saw my mother already folding gold paper by the dim stove corner. Her gaunt face was covered with endless sorrow, and I knew that there was no more food at home for me to eat.</p>
<p>Without even drinking a drop of boiled water, I ran out of the house with a few test guides and past papers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I still had a ragged and dirty blue cloth gown to wear, and I took advantage of the fact that the manager was tidying up the magazines to sneak into the reading room of the ×-year association.</p>
<p>Flipping through the newspapers on the newspaper rack, I still didn't see the "Hunger" article that I had sent out ten days ago published, which made me very worried and angry; my mind immediately realized the passage in the book that Hamsun wrote, saying: "The large wastepaper basket with its dragon mouth in the editor's office seems to be able to swallow even human bones!"</p>
<p>As soon as I sat down and didn't even read three pages, the light of hunger had already begun to crowd into my eyeballs. It made me lose the ability to recognize every word on the book, and when I looked up, I suddenly saw my face reflected on the large glass opposite me, which made me jump up. Just half a month of unemployment had made my cheeks sunken, my eyes deep-set, and my pale and bluish face was covered with disheveled, withered hair.</p>
<p>I no longer had the courage to sit there and read; so I quickly withdrew. When my weak arm pushed the fan-spring door, the manager's sharp eyes swept directly over me, nailing on the few books under my arm. I wasn't afraid of this, but what I was afraid of was that he would ask me for my "membership card".</p>
<p>The compulsion of hunger made me no longer think about the word "face". At this time, I seemed to have walked to a silk shop on Nanjing Road to find my uncle.</p>
<p>Although moved by his sympathy, he agreed to lend me a dollar, but when he went in to get the money, the "high-nosed" leather shoes kicked me. I couldn't stand his encore, so of course I had to leave, and who can you blame for not being able to borrow money and eating "foreign ham"?</p>
<p>Lowering my head, I stroked my wound in an alley and saw a five-cent bill falling out of a child's pocket. At this time, I didn't know what "honesty" and "shame" were, and I quickly reached out and picked it up, and then happily slipped out.</p>
<p>At a stall, I used this five cents to buy a sesame cake and put it in my mouth. Although it was a dry and hard thing, it was moistened by saliva and immediately turned into a "food ball" rolling in my mouth, emitting a delicious sweet taste. I thought: thirty-five dollars for a big dish, in the mouths of those rich people who are full of warmth all day long, there is definitely no such delicious taste, right? I became proud and proud, tightly choking my throat and chewing carefully, hoping that this "food ball" would exist forever, but in a moment, my mouth was empty again.</p>
<p>When I returned home, my mother was still sitting by the dim stove corner, folding paper ingots taken from the tinfoil shop. Looking at her red and swollen eyes, I knew she had been crying. I took off the "one and only" blue cloth gown on my body and handed it to her, saying, "Mom, don't be sad anymore. In a few days, when the postman informs me that I've been hired, won't we be able to live? Take this clothes to pawn, buy some rice, and cook some porridge to drink."</p>

<h3>Talking About Liu Yanting</h3>
<p>— Danran</p>
<p>When discussing famous net performers in the North and South, people only know Hao Jinhou and Li, but they don't mention Liu Yanting at all, which makes me very confused. In addition to his loud and solid voice, Hao's practice of calligraphy has strength, and his singing style, facial makeup, and body movements do not follow the mainstream. Shaoshan's voice is strong and his stage presence is majestic, but his singing style and body movements are a major shortcoming. Ju Xi has no voice and is also thin and small, only maintaining his air and style, and is not a complete talent for painted faces. Li Chunheng's voice is full and suitable for both bronze hammer and frame roles. Dramas such as "Stealing the Imperial Horse," "Loyalty and Filial Piety," "Puqiu Mountain," and "Beating the Dragon Robe" are no less than Hao Jinhou. In recent years, he has worked hard to learn from Hao Shouchang, and his fierceness is quite similar, but his status has instead declined because of this. Li is comparable to Hao in age and cannot be placed between Sun Shengwen, Yuan Shihai, Qiu Shengrong, and Wang Quankui. He cannot be mentioned alongside Hao Jinhou, and cannot be included in the younger generation of painted faces. Therefore, the name Li Chunheng is not noticed by outsiders.</p>
<p>Liu Yanting is the brother of Liu Yanfang, Yang Xiaolou's beloved son-in-law, and has long been with Xiaolou. There was originally Qian Jinfu as a martial net performer in Xiaolou's troupe, so Yanting was the second-tier martial net performer in the troupe; and below Qian Jinfu, there was also Xu Yintang's son Xu Deyi. Liu's position in Yang's troupe was below Xu Deyi, so he sometimes also performed second-tier frame plays. He privately admired Huang Runfu and Jin Xiushan very much. Guan Tai in "Luoma Lake" and the big boss in "Chain Set" must be played by Yanting. When Yang Xiaolou posted "Changban Slope," Zhang Fei was Qian Jinfu, Cao Hong was Xu Deyi, and Yanting was assigned to play Zhang Liao. When Xiaolou came out for the last time, because Qian Jinfu was old and did not participate, Liu Yanting replaced Qian in singing: Li Pei in "Luoma Lake," Zhang Fei in "Changban Slope," Jin Wuzhu in "Picking the Carriage," and Sima Shi in "Iron Dragon Mountain" were not inferior to Qian Jinfu. Quanfu had no voice, and Yanting could sing, so this was indeed better than him. A few years ago, Hao Shouchang resigned from the troupe for some reason, and Yang Xiaolou assigned Yanting to perform all of Hao's plays, and the performance was no less wonderful than Shouchang. Since Hao returned to Yang's troupe, Liu has followed Tan Fuying to travel north and south; Liu Jin in "Famen Temple," Xia Houlun in "Dingjun Mountain," Ma Su in "Empty City Stratagem," Huang Gai in "Gathering of Heroes," Chen Youliang in "Battle of Taiping," Xian Mi in "Picking the Tassels," Bao Gong in "Pot Case," Jin Wuzhu in "Eight Great Hammers," Niu Gao in "Zhenjizhou," and Zhou Dewei in "Pearl Curtain Village" were all not weak; among them, the roles of Ma Su and Xia Houlun were especially excellent, and seemed to be better than Cheng Shaoyu, who is famous in the South for these two roles. I once saw him perform "Shiyang Garden," "Gucheng Association" (substituting for his younger brother), and "Down to Hedong" with Li Hongchun, which can be called good plays. He occasionally performed "Qingfeng Village" and "Taking Luoyang" and was also outstanding. Feng Xiaoyin, a critic of operas, rarely praises current actors, but he has a unique eye for Yanting, saying "Watching Hao Hou's plays is like watching Liu Yanting." This is because Yanting's art is simple and unadorned, without arrogance or affectation. This is why Mr. Feng abandoned Hao Hou and took Liu Yanting.</p>

<p>Before struggling, you need to know some theories of struggle; and the completion of the theory lies entirely in practice. You can only constantly struggle with adversity, and after a long time and many failures, you can gradually complete your theory, which is unbreakable.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Ba</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Where in Life Do We Not Meet?</p>
<p>I muddled through a few years, and with the help of my brothers, I actually had food and clothing and lived a carefree life. But when I asked myself in quiet, I wondered if this copper-筋铁肋 body of mine was born to be buried in this wilderness, unable to wield a sword and perform meritorious service for the country, go to battle and kill thieves, and leave behind a beautiful name in history? I couldn't help but feel a little unwilling. Later, I met a person in the Jianghu that I knew, named Chai Ying. He was going to join the army at Wu Sangui's military headquarters in Shanhaiguan. He advised me not to do this Green Forest life, but to abandon darkness and return to righteousness, and also go to the official army to serve. I agreed to him and let him stay on the mountain for a few days. When he was about to leave, he said to me that if he was accepted into the army, he would ask someone to send me a letter. Sure enough, less than a year after he left, a person came with a letter from him, calling me to go with him. Therefore, I disbanded the gang and went down the mountain to embark on the journey to join General Wu. I only carried my two treasures with me: one was the black horse tied outside the door, whose whole body was pure black, with long hooves and round ears, and it was really capable of traveling a thousand miles a day and eight hundred miles a night. In addition, there was a Ling Bao sword, which was left over from the Wei and Jin dynasties. Zhang Cangqiu pressed his hand on the hilt of the sword at his waist, smiled very proudly, and then continued: "Today I passed by here, and I was just about to ask someone for a meal, but I heard you reading aloud, and you were reading very nicely. I couldn't help but disturb you. But in today's world, a great chaos is about to rise. What is the use of you studying behind closed doors here, even if you study well? I haven't asked the host's name yet, but I've already said too much. Please tell me."</p>
<p>When the young man heard his words, he felt that his speech was very straightforward and worthy of being a strong man in the wind and dust. He himself had always admired wandering knights, thinking that the disciples of Zhujia and Guo Jie were rare in this world. Today, meeting this uninvited guest, he had the appearance of a Qiu Songgong-like figure, and it was even more commendable that he could lay down his butcher knife and resolve to join the army. So he was very happy and said, "My name is Xu, and my given name is Jing. I have lived here outside Qixian City for generations. My late father was an old scholar, and he never took a meritorious name in his life. He had no choice but to irrigate and farm the fields, and died of old age under the window. When he was about to die, he repeatedly told me to study hard and to express his repressed feelings for him in the future. Unfortunately, I don't like the study of the examination system. Although I passed the boy's examination, I failed the exam several times after that, which almost completely discouraged me. I study behind closed doors here to serve my old mother, confined like a foal under the shaft. Please don't laugh at me, strong man." (3)</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shouwu</p>
<p>Xinhua Company recently had a "Lightning" plan, imitating the precedent of "Lianhua Symphony", inviting directors and stars to cooperate on a "National League Symphony". After a meeting of giants, it was decided to change the original proposal and use all this energy on the filming of "Home". "Home" has been performed by the Shanghai Drama Art Society and has been fully booked since then, so Xinhua's move has a "business eye".</p>
<p>After Zhao Zhiyou rented the Xuan Palace Theater for a price of 20,000 yuan, there were rumors that the Shanghai Drama Art Society would move to the Xuan Palace to perform, and would be renamed "China Art Theater". According to the latest information, this statement was originally 70% reliable, but it is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Director Situ Weimin of Hong Kong New Life Company's "Love of the Motherland" will not start until the middle of this month, and is now recruiting male and female actors. Judging from the literal meaning, the film is about the life of overseas Chinese, so the location may be filmed in Java or the Philippines.</p>
<p>Minhua's "Song of Ancient China" filmed "Flooding the Seven Armies" yesterday. Ruidebao played Guan Gong and Liang Lianzhu played Zhou Cang, which is a rare combination. Rui's Guan Gong opera was once offered to the Qing court. The exquisite nature of his art can be imagined, and from now on, "offering" will be shared with the public. As for Liang Lianzhu, he is a veteran of the Fu Liancheng troupe. Among the net performers in Shanghai, counting heads, he is indispensable. No wonder so many people came to visit and watch the show, all to appreciate the art of drama.</p>
<h3>Movie City Trends</h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>Alfred Hitchcock, the British director of "Rebecca", is working hard to complete another masterpiece, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith". He searched for a suitable actress for the film among 225 girls, but was still disappointed. So he complained, "There isn't a single beautiful woman in all of Hollywood." This is really a strange story in the movie city!</p>
<p>Even now, some people still regret the breakup of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The musicals they collaborated on, such as "Swing Time" and "Follow the Fleet", are still deeply imprinted in the minds of movie fans. Since breaking up, both of them have been depressed and have not found a satisfactory partner, although Ginger Rogers has changed her style.</p>
<p>May Robson, who specializes in playing stubborn old ladies on the screen, has dedicated herself to the film industry for 56 years. She has a great-granddaughter who is four years old and is now training her to become a child star on the stage. With Robson's experience and knowledge and the child's talent, that great-granddaughter has a great chance of becoming the second Shirley Temple.</p>
<p>James Cagney, the "killer" on the screen, has become even more popular with movie fans since the release of "City for Conquest", and there is hope of winning an Oscar. Cagney's recent work is "The Strawberry Blonde", co-starring with Rita Hayworth and Olivia de Havilland, directed by the great director Raoul Walsh.</p>
