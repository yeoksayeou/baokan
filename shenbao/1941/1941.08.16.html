<h3>英美商妥合作計劃　時局將有迅速發展　兩國協約有成為同盟可能　英政府宣布禁絕商品輸日</h3>
<p>合衆社十五日倫敦電　英國本日預期英美關於戰爭之合作，將有迅速之發展，外交及政治評論家謂就斯福及邱吉爾會唔時、英美兩國之海陣空軍領袖皆在塲，故謂此次會唔之結果、或將使美積極參戰、據信英美海陸空軍領袖之分別會晤、係等於參謀會商、且據信彼等係集中於大西洋之戰及日本云、「每日電訊報」外交訪員宜稱、「關於兩國在該兩處重要地方所能採取之一致行動顯　已獲有決定」、</p>
<p>合衆社十五日華盛頓電　此間觀察家本日宜稱、邱吉爾及羅斯福總統之會商　朁彼等與英美軍事領袖之會談結果、必至使美國更大集中其軍事實力、以為英蘇之後盾、但彼等指示此種援助、不致達到作戰之程度、此項英美領袖之重要會議、本身雖不足以使美國更近臨於實際宜戰、但此次會議所採取之決定、結果使英美及蘇聯更密切合作、因此實際之效果、將為增加美國對於戰事結果之衝突、負責方面宣稱、羅斯福總統已造成一英美協的、此項協的可為將來軍事同盟之前奏、戰後和平目標之八點程序反映美國政府之態度、並為協的之根據、在國際危機需嬰時、並可發展而為正式同盟云、</p>
<p>路透社十五日華盛頓電　今日美京一般情緒、皆以為英美即將有決定性之幷行措施、以實踐舛邱兩氏海上會議所商妥之各項政策、此間消息靈通之外交人士咸以為此項會議之結果、將遠過於舛一紙說明和平目的之聯合宣言、若干官塲人士之意見、則認羅期福總統或將於爐邊談話中繼續發表海上會議之詳情、</p>
<p>路透社十五日紐約電　目前各報及無綫電中所反映之美國興情、漸信此次美總統與英首相合談之範圍、實遠超於戰爭目的之上、並有許多社論家及無綫電評論家指稱、倘無有計劃之行動為後盾、則此項宣言姝少意義、故彼等皆預料將有行動、現時美國之干涉派皆期待文字之後、將繼以行動、而孤立派則黯然暗示美總統現所從事之秘密擔任、</p>
<p>路透社十五日紐約電　「紐約時報」今日社論、謂美國孤立時期現已過去、而美國在此世界大戰中担負責任之時期今已開始、此次英美聯合宣言將指導英美兩國之努力、而測度其進行至戰爭終止和平奠定而後已云、</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　英政府已宣布對日本採取新的經濟行動、商部頃發命令從八月十五日起、禁止一切出口品運往日本、包括日方代管各島中之卡拉芬島·及朝鮮·關東租借地·台灣·與滿洲在內、唯領得商部執照者除外、前發許運往上述各地之出口執照、現一律取消、</p>
<p>合衆社十五日倫敦電　衆信英政府此項步驟、乃英美會議以後之第一次堅强措施、觀察家稱、此舉乃在向日本證明英美兩國決維持遠東之現狀、此舉並表示於必要時英美且將作更强硬之措施、以阻止足以直接影響英美利益之進一步侵略、</p>
<p>路透社十五日東京電　英商部近禁止若干物品遝至日本、並未引起日人之反動、因自戰事爆發但、日英間實際已停止買易也、衆意新禁令於日影響甚微、</p>
<h3>天羽繼大橋　任日外次</h3>
<p>合衆社十五日東京電　官方頃稱，前駐義大使天羽英二已被任為外次以代大橋、</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　熟諳遠東事務之某觀察者評述天羽被任日外次事云、鑒於日本若干極端親軸心報紙曾批評日外相豐田並勸其任命能澈底了解如何實行日本之決定政策者為外次、故天羽此次之任命、殊堪注意、因天羽向被認為駐英大使重光葵之一派、而重光則又為日本與外國人士所共認比較謹愼之人物、不以繼續冒險為然者也、</p>
<h3>大批澳生力軍　開抵星島增防</h3>
<p>合衆社十五日新加坡電　官方頃發布公季稱、有力之澳洲軍業已抵新加坡增防、此項增防軍隊包括各種隊伍、內並有航空員、以是使馬來之防禦益為强固、大量澳洲軍之來此增防、足以表明澳洲已決意協助馬來以遏阻南太平洋之侵略、又權威人士發表談話稱、來此增防之澳洲軍隊為數極多、為開抵馬來增防軍隊中所僅見之浩大軍隊、兩星期來此為抵達此間之第三批英國軍隊、該軍隊包括步兵·砲兵·服務隊·工程隊野戰救護隊等、雖來此之該軍亦携有配備、然多數配備如勃倫砲·平射砲　摩托運送車等均已先期扺達、英遠東總司令樸芳及駐馬來亞澳軍司邊納德均致詞歡迎新到之澳軍、</p>
<p>路透社十五日新加坡電　今日澳洲生力軍之到達、此間人十皆認為係澳洲之決心以新加坡為其第一道防綫之似象、並表示英澳及其在太平洋之協的國家現採取不屈不撓之政策、以抵抗仟何國家干預該區域人民自由之企圖、現時分佈馬來之數萬英澳及印度軍隊、實為抵禦任何繼續侵略之最好屛藩、今日馬來人民之歡迎澳軍、係由於感覺本區現已較任何時更為安全之一念、</p>
<p>路透社十五日墨爾缽電　軍事顧問委員會曾全日開會、但未發表正式文告、聞係透澈討論遠東之大局、與其他國際問題、衆信並曾提及孟席斯赴倫敦問題、惟覺該問題應由國會決之、戰爭內閣與全體內閱、均將於星期二日在雪梨開會、</p>
<h3>美遠東軍司令　朂勉將士用命</h3>
<p>合衆此十五日馬尼刺電　美國遠東軍總司令麥克奧塞中將本日在薩百蘭航空塲所舉行之典禮中演說、歡迎菲列賓空軍隊加入美國陸軍、麥氏稱、「余歡迎此一羣優良之靑年士加人美國陸軍中服役、汝等現為遠東軍之一份子、余　信如戰爭來臨、汝等之責任」云、非官方估計編入美國陸軍之菲空軍隊人員、約有飛行官員一百人、軍人五百名、</p>
<h3>美運油船第一艘　離美駛海參崴　載機油九萬五千加侖　荷印貨物改運至蘇聯</h3>
<p>合衆社十五日華盛頓電　昨日官方發表、第一艘運飛機油至蘇聯之　油船懸美　國旗、已於昨日離洛杉磯赴海參崴、此係四艘運油至蘇聯油船中之一艘、共載飛機油九萬五千加崙、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十四日倫敦電　英國廣播電台頃發出消息稱、據荷蘭政府宣佈、原當運往日本之貨物、現已留待改運蘇聯、蘇船多艘並已滿載此項貨物駛回海參崴港云、</p>
<h3>泰國切望　保持和平　美駐泰公使易人　日泰使節互昇格</h3>
<p>合衆社十五日盤谷電　議會昨日薄暮時通過政府非常法案、建立一交通部、該法案在一次會議中即被通過、同時據外交部之公吿、否認美國駐泰公使格朗特曾建議以美國車事援助取泰國之親日政策、該文云、「關於此種建議並無事實之根據、泰國之政策係人盡為友、」又言格朗特與首相宋格南之會議、在增進兩國邦交而已、同時時事評論家三夜來連續向國內播送一「根據菩薩精神」之和平言論稱、政府擬向有關各國作和平建議、</p>
<p>路透社十五日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統已指定北平美大使館參贊裴克、為美國駐泰公使、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>薪脩階級之生活費調查</h3>
<p>自凍結資金辦法公表以來，所加於匯市者，未若所加於物價者之嚴重，蓋物價如颶風突起，霎時上漲甚多。尤以大連油之把持如中風疾走，所漲最烈。蔬菜食用諸品，本以資人類生活，買賣自由，今則微賤如靑菜豆芽，比之四年前，亦肉食不啻。國人何辜，遭此塗炭；物產何往，專為共用。自有此共用圈加諸國人之身，而國人之生活受盡桎梏縲絏之苦，日益加甚。雖然、為共用所予生活上之威脅壓迫至如何地步，一般但知其為高壓，為苦痛，為窒悶，為呻昑，未有器具以測度之，未有數字以表示之，則其程度雖深刻，而不易明嘹其深刻之為如何深刻、更不易使人一目了然於深刻乃至如此地步，於是而知尺度之不可不備，猶似長短之不可不知，深淺之不可不曉也。</p>
<p>然則，為之尺度者誰何，即一般之生活費指數是也。生活費指數者，用數字指示一般生活費用之高低也。報章所習見，則為工人生活費指數。但生活未可以一概論，享用之優劣懸殊，程度之高低不一，固有窮至炊餅度日，亦有富至珍饈猶難下咽。然有優厚之收益，高貴之生活，則如物價雖昂騰，不難利用其資力以囤積居奇，投機操縱；即利用房地產高抬租金、攆逐房客，濫收小費；開設工廠商店者，則可一切加於貨價之中，轉嫁於消費者之身，一言以蔽之，巧取豪奪藉於人，以補償其所不足耳，祇有定量收益之薪工階級，但見物價望前跑，而其生活向後退。非謂其收益一無增加也，良以薪津所增加之速率，遠不逮物價高漲之速率為迅且速。故從生活費用支出數字上以為觀察，則大事擴充，進步不少；而從生活享用上以為衡量，則日見惡劣，大不如前，退步良多。此種生活矛盾之現象，於今為甚。在工人已有生活費指數，在西人亦有其指數，固不難將其生活之情况，用數字表現之。惟有中國薪脩階級，占社會之主堅部分，方憔悴熬煎於生活壓迫之中，獨無有與衆共見之機會。而遇有生活上合理之調整，亦苦於缺乏準繩，旁取證於工人生活費指數。雖日薪工階級之處境相同，同為定量收益，同係勞務取償，同是被雇傭者、然從其生活上形式言之，或有不盡相同之處。俚語常有「一件長衫最害事」；「長衫」云者，蓋為薪脩階級之一種象徵，非謂工資階級之不穿長衫也。為習用此一襲長衫，頓使生活上平添許多支出，一切飮食起居服御，往往比工人為高，而其收益未必盡優於工資階級虛塲面之支撑，大為薪脩階級之累，然既不改變其生活方式，不作事賓實上之檢討，奚為而怨天尤人。惟有薪脩階級，轉將其生活情况之輪廓，同樣托出，此則生活費指數尙矣。</p>
<p>薪脩階級生活費指數，從事編製，十餘年前已有此說。惟從職與工言之，當時工人生活之改善，有急於職，故先之以工人生活費指數之編製。而使薪脩階級之生活費調查，因循迄今，未見諸事實，亦職是之欽。昨報始見有工部局工業社會處支薪階級之生活費調查，自係當務之急。蓋欲編某一階級之生活費指數，必先明瞭某一階級生活費支出之實况，而後知其為某一部分費用，占其全部分費用之若干，方可計算某一部分物價之升降，所影響於其某一部分生活者如何！家計調查，即為此準備工作耳。今所徵集之記帳家庭，以薪脩家庭為限，不限行業，而以農工及自設行業者除外。家主之收入，以月入不出一千元者占十之三，五百元以下者占十之七，偏重於月入小額方面，深得大衆化之意。記帳期限為三個月，時間短而易舉。夫以上海薪脩階級之衆盛，及邇來生活之艱困，痛心疾首於目前生活之無法解決，焦急惶慮於未來生活之如何得度，乃得有此機會，將其實際生活所必需之費用，稍費數分鐘紀錄之勞，供獻於社會，直接亦自為計，間接即為全體薪脩家庭計。以上海薪脩階級智識之提高，及主婦之受敎育者漸多，家庭記帳，非為難事，可必其應徵之家庭，當不止此數，惟是記帳家庭之戶數愈多，則其分析比較之間，愈精密為可靠。記帳時間能酌量延長，則其所包括生活費用之品彙愈備，與生活的實際情况愈接近。此則終須視編制方面人力經費之厚薄，及薪修階級記帳家庭贊助之多寡以為斷。然工業社會處既有此一舉，觀成不遠，願且拭目以待之。</p>

<p>河內　官方頃發表公報稱、「外國方面、尤其是英人方面、日昨曾散佈謠言、謂法國駐越南軍隊、業已集中雲南廣西兩省邊境附近、掩護日軍侵華、英方又從重慶發出消息、謂此項法軍、係在掩護日軍側翼、中法兩國關係旣已惡化、則此舉原不足異云云、茲須鄭重聲明者、此項謊報、全出反法宣傳一貫作風、實係向壁虛造、絕無其事」、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>泰氏出身名門，其父Devendranath　Tagore，當時的人稱之為Mlaharishi（意即大隱士或大師），家居加爾各答。泰氏我於一八六一年五月六月出世。據民國十三年五月十九日泰氏在北平眞光戲院公開演講，謂當時有三種有歷史意義的巨潮：一是宗敎改革運動，二是新文學運動，三是國民自主運動。泰氏自謂，對於第二種運動，比較有相當貢獻。又說，現在人們往往喜新厭舊，拋棄固有文化，去接受西洋文化。其實選擇文化的標準，不在乎新與舊，而在乎文化所含的精神價値。</p>
<p>敎育理想</p>
<p>泰氏生性，從小崇拜自然，酷愛自由，最反對傳統敎育對於兒童所加的束縛。一九三〇年九月，泰氏游游莫斯科，曾對學生作自傳式的講話，茲節譯數段如下：</p>
<p>「我年輕時，也曾進過學校，但我最不喜歡在課室內上課，因我愛好自然。有些敎員，對我缺少同情，他們不能了解有些兒童有一顆柔嫩靈敏的心靈，反而以壓力相加。其實呢，兒童的不服從，正足以表示敎員所用方法的失敗。我到了十三歲，就從學校中逃出，以後我永遠不再進學校了。從學校逃走後，我就開始自力硏究。我隱居在一個靠近恒河的地方，多半時間，住在一只小船上。我在那裏寫詩，寫小說，寫劇本，做我甜蜜的夢。不久，我的名聲，漸漸宣揚出去了。在此，就有許多人從各地來要同我結識，而我的隱居生活，也就不能再行繼續下去了。</p>
<p>「我對於敎育事業，從來沒有辦過。我怎樣敢大膽地去辦敎育，連我自己也是莫明其妙。不過，我自信對於兒童具有深刻的同情心，而且我所選擇的地點，非常幽靜美麗（按即平安鄉），遠大離都會的惡濁環境。這種幽美的環境，能激發人類所固有的創造力。我在那裏，招集了五六個兒童。我不但敎導他們，而且做朋友，唱歌給他們聽。我製成了譜曲劇本，他們就幫我演唱。這就是我所創辦的學校的開始情形。</p>
<p>「我盡量讓我的學生有自由發展及發表的機會，我竭力引起他們對於自然，音樂，藝術及鄉邨的興趣。這種敎育，我覺得是最理想的。不過，後來學生人數增加了，不得不有相當改變。如收學費的辦法，就是改變的一端。因為，舊時印度的理想，敎師不但免費供給敎育，而且係擔負學生生活上一切需要。等到人數增加，這種辦法，自然無法繼續。不過，我後來雖然不能不收費，但是，我仍舊保守着師生必須共同生活的一點，而且在各種活動上，師生必須合作。所可惜的，共同生活的一點，而且在各種活動上，師生必須合作。所可惜的，有些從外面請為的敎員，因傳統敎育的背景，有時未能澈底了解我的敎育宗旨。有一次，一個新敎員，因為看見有幾個學生，爬到上去預備功課，他就大生其氣，要責罰他們。我那時不得不廻護，這些學生，並且吿訴之位先生說：不要責罰他們。因為不久他們到萬惡的社會裏去，也許要與大自然脫離關係。即使要想爬樹，恐怕也屬不可能了。</p>
<p>「此外還有一點，我也特別注重我竭力在學校中造成一種國際空氣，我常請東西各國的聞人，來校演講。這樣學生狹窄的胸襟，漸漸可以擴大，我自信對於此點，已有相當成功。最後還有一點，我在附近村荘中，設立了許多夜班，使我的學生擔任夜校敎書的工作。同時，他們可以在我所舉辦的農邨事業中，獲得許多練習的機會。這樣，敎育與生活，就可以打成一片了。」</p>
<p>我們看了以上一段自白，不但可以知道泰氏的生平，更可了解泰氏的敎育理想。</p>
<p>森林哲學</p>
<p>「森林的使命」貫澈着泰氏的全部思想，全部藝術，好像詩歌的疊句一樣。泰氏曾說：「森林與沙漠　石或洋海不同，它是活的，它覆育人類的生命。在森林裏，古代印度的隱者，體認了人生與宇宙間的和諧性，及眞理的統一性。而且，他們從此體認出自我精神與全宇宙的連鎖。」在生命的實現（按此書為氏在哈佛大學演講集）裏，泰氏吿訴聽衆說：「印度文化起源於樹林之中，樹林的環境，形成了印度文化的品質。森林的偉大，並未使人生感覺渺小，相反地，森林的環境，刺激了人生固有的創造性，擴大了人類的同情性。後來，農業發展，都市興起，森林逐漸减少，但是印度人仍　留戀着回憶着，森林的文明。因此，印度人的觀點，與西洋人所主張的以自然為非人的人須征服自然的觀點，逈乎不同。」</p>
<p>這種崇拜自然使人生與自然合一的思想，其形成自有它歷史的與地理的原因。但旣經形成之後，對於文化，就有深刻的影響。印度敎的環境所產生的森林哲學。我們讀泰氏的詩文、如Chitra和Gi'anjali等名著，處處流露着這種森林哲學。如Chitra中的Brahmana篇，泰氏描寫森林學校的　幕如下：</p>

<h3>英美宣言發表後　滬中外一致振奮　期待世界眞正和平實現中國最後勝利愈臻具體</h3>
<p>自美總統羅斯福與英首相邱吉爾·在海上會談、英美兩國發表共同宣書後、本埠所有中西人士、對於聯合宜言、一致表示眞心之擁護、而以丹麥·荷蘭·比利時·捷克·希臘·挪威·南斯拉夫·自由法國·波蘭等因戰事而疆土淪陷之國家僑民、更感興趣、因在戰後世界新秩序中、「各國在其疆陲之內、可以安居」、而「被武力剝奪之各國、均能恢復主權與自主政府也、</p>
<p>各國僑民信心益堅</p>
<p>各該國僑民、鑒於新世界秩序、必能實現、因此信心愈爲堅强、除竭力策動留滬僑民一致團結外、又推進各項服務運動、如籌集紅會捐款·航空基金及派遣志願軍赴前綫與敵人作殊死之戰</p>
<p>英美人士大受鼓勵</p>
<p>至滬英美當局、對於此種新發展以事實俱在、不願多所論述、但兩國僑民無不默祝此一歷史性之宜言、能保證世界眞正和平之實現、使人民均能安居樂業、尤以英方之僑民團體、如皇家空軍協會·戰時服務協會·英僑協會等、愈因此一宣言、蒙受極大之鼓勵、</p>

<p>奠定世界合理基礎</p>
<p>英國情報處摩萊氏昨晚在ＣＤＮ電台作一週間時事廣播、略稱、羅斯福與邱吉爾秘密而有戲劇性之海上會議、已因英國掌　大臣阿特里之報吿、其眞相大明、羅邱二氏共同聲明之八原則、不但確定最後勝利、目健全世界將獲有史完美更合理之基礎、預料希特勒因侵蘇之失敗、勢必自他處進攻、以獲得高加素首富之油田、最可能作爲希特勒假道之處、即為土耳其與伊郎、惟英蘇已聯合向土耳其作堅決之保證、苟一旦遭受攻擊、英蘇二國必全力予以援助、此一保證、巳獲得安哥拉懇摯之歡迎、故不論希特勒是否將作此孤注一擲、然其失敗、殆已前定、且羅邱之會議、將使世界兩大壁壘之陣營、益加明顯、敵人所揑造可恥之和平謠言、已不攻自破、</p>

<h3>七災童申請助學　自述家庭遭遇　一片童心至情流露　立場向學並氣餒</h3>
<p>在幼敎養院畢業的七個難童，這一學期都考取了蘇州中學，他們由敎養院的介紹，向本報申請「讀者助學金」。前天下午他們很有紀律的，集團到館來面叙他們的家世和遭遇，都是火藥氣息下的流浪者，有的喪父，有的亡母，還有一個是父母雙亡的，雖然是這樣，他們並不氣餒，一致的立志向學。下面是他們每一個人的筆述。</p>
<p>歐德標</p>
<p>「八一三」以前，吾在閘北新民路，來安里某號居住，戰爭爆發，房子被佔據，我便和父·母·姊弟，逃出到新世界收容所，住了一年多，後因新世界的房方要收回房屋，便遷到文藝司路的廣慈第一收容所。不幸父母生傷寒症，在醫院裏便與我永別了！我中有靠着姊姊過日子。但終算不幸中之幸，出該所的主任介紹到工華收容所裏去，住了一年，便由工華收容所改組了幼幼敎養院到現在。我在院中已經畢業了。近聞貴報館發起「申報讀者助學金」，我們眞是歡喜的了不得。經院中老師們給我們到蘇州中學去報名投考，眞是使我想不到的快樂，後來我們便考取了，老師們便叫我們馬上塡表，送到貴報館來，希望貴報館盡力幫助我們，使我們不至有失學的危險。我更要努力用功，才不失貴報的先生們和各界慈善家一番熱心的贊助。</p>
<p>陸家良　「八一三」以前，是在寳山縣鄕下，戰爭爆發以後，從鄕下逃出來，跑了一天進租界，過着流浪的生活。後來有親戚介紹我們到慈生收容所，住了一年多。我父母回家去看看家鄕，可是都被燒掉了，只有一片瓦礫。我父母再回上海，領我一同到鄕下去，在親戚家裏住下，住有了，食怎樣呢？我父親很傷心，就去做工，可是一天的工資只有一元，不能過生活，我們上海的親戚知道了，就來信介紹我到工華收容所，住了一年，就改組幼幼敎養院，我已在六年級上學期，這時候，不幸我父親死了，母親就在家中過着一個人的生活，現在我已六年級畢業，無力再升學，所以來請助</p>
<p>黃榮生　我住在南市斜土路魯班路口首元里某號，有我的雙親和弟弟，我父是做木匠的。我在附近的小學裏讀書，是免費的。我弟弟沒有讀書，到了我十歲的時候，我媽去世了，我心裏非常悲傷。我弟弟天天號哭，可是後來戰爭爆發，我父親和我還有我弟弟，一同逃到租界上來，將晚的時候，仁濟堂的卡四送我們到慧成收容所，後來有熟人把我送到工華收容所，過了幾年，工華收容所改組，就是現在的幼幼敎養院。</p>
<p>高忠德　父任職商務印書館，戰時失業，一家八口，多逃往福州路復興收容所，一年以後，復興收容所解散，後來就進慈願收容所，在這時，我母親請求一位朋友介紹我到幼幼敎養院，廿九年十一月廿一日，我母親就和我們父子幾個長別了，我母親逝世的一年，我已十五歲了，我哥哥做小販為業，弟弟在慈願求學，現在我在幼幼敎養院已經小學畢業，特向貴報館申請助學金，以便繼續求學。</p>
<p>張超倫</p>
<p>滬戰之前，家住上海附近鄕下，我九歲時死了母親，父親在上海做事，家中經濟尚稱富裕，戰事爆發，一家四口逃往租界，父親失業，因此生活難能維持，後幸熟人介紹至國際救濟會第六難民收容所，供給膳宿，還有寳貴的讀書機會，後因所中經濟關係解散，我被所　送進幼幼敎養院工華收容所，繼續求學，現已小學畢業，仍想繼續求學，但是學費沒有辦法，見到貴報發起助學金，專為淸寒子弟造福，眞是做夢也想不到的。</p>
<p>嚴厚章</p>
<p>戰事未爆發以前，我家住在南市董家渡，一家五口，我在董家渡天主堂正修第一小學讀書，戰爭爆發後，就逃到本鄕吳興縣，過了二年後，逃回上海，那時父親已經失業，經親戚介紹，到十六舖去做伙計，一月只賺二十元，勉强維持生活，我經人介紹到幼幼敎養院去讀書，一轉眼已經小學畢業，後來申報上登着助學金，我們的級任老師同我講去考蘇州中學，同時再考新北中學等，總算錄取，因為申報館是同我們出學費雜費等，這是多麽幸福的一件事！眞是感謝不盡！</p>
<p>胡繼生</p>
<p>從我家鄕被佔後，我就離難到上海來，到我舅父家裏，因為舅父家裏人多，每月開支不够，我就不能久居，所以請舅父找救濟難民學校，結果把我送進幼幼敎養院，我很歡喜，院裏有書讀，有飯吃，眞是好像家庭，我讀了二年，就畢業，但是我感覺我的常識和技能不够，所以很悲痛，現在貴報館能幫助窮苦的學生！是很難得的，所以我來申請助學金；希望能求得豐富的學識。</p>

<h3>求雨遊行</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>據一位新到上海的朋友吿訴我，某地亢旱六個月，土地龜裂，農民叫苦連天，縣老爺爲體恤民衆的痛苦，特發起求雨遊行，並迫令小學校的學生全體參加。結果不詳。</p>
<p>上古時代，我們的祖光把自然界的風雨雷電看做不可了解的神秘現象，以爲是神靈震怒顯威，這在愚昧無知的古代，是不足引以爲異的。然而在科學昌明的二十世紀，我們早已明瞭這是自然界的現象，與神靈無關。在蘇聯，科學家正在試騐人造雨，據說已有相當的成續。預料在不久的將來，人類能呼風喚雨，並非奇事。</p>
<p>然而可憐的是，在我們中國，一部份人民的思想，遠與原始時代的人類榷差無幾。我們還以爲雨是可以求而得的，我們還以爲亢旱是上天的旨意，也許有人還以爲這是神靈的責罰呢。</p>
<p>學校應該是傳播科學智識的敎育機關，學童是未來的社會中堅，然而在我們中國，却得放棄了科學智識去參加求雨遊行，這是多麼可憐可笑的事。</p>
<p>在科學上思想上，我們跟別人實在是相差太遠了。我們還得急起直追啊。</p>
<p>風土</p>
<h3>寒帶的砇羣</h3>
<p>— 錢家駿</p>
<p>一般人都以爲氣候炎熱的地方該是蚊蟲最多爲害最烈的區域了。但是這是錯誤的，要知道成羣結隊的蚊蟲，也正佈滿在寒冷的亞歐美三洲的北部呢。</p>
<p>在蘇俄戰爭中，德芬聯軍發動了歐陸北部的攻勢以後，其進展的遲緩爲小可否認的事實。這固然是蘇俄的奮勇抵抗之功，不過埋伏在森林與池沼地帶的蚊蟲，也有一部份功勞的。當德軍作戰或酣睡的時候，牠們就立即施行「空襲」，藉尖利的嘴，拚命吸吮日耳曼人血液，然後得意洋洋，安然飛返原防。這種「飛機」簡直使納粹軍隊覺得比英國的旋風式和噴火式飛機還要害怕，因爲即使克虜伯兵工廠所造的最好高射砲，也無法對付牠們呀。</p>
<p>在加拿大的北部，一個美國探險隊發現那邊的蚊蟲委實大多了。把手掌打在食桌上，準會打死百以上，有時手竟完全變成了紅色。幕帳上平均每六方吋有三十個蚊子，所以一個幕帳共有萬四千隻之多。有幾個探險隊員會將手放在空間五分鐘，便有五六十隻蚊蟲停下來。</p>
<p>我國外蒙古的集幾處地方，當旅行者或商隊要長途跋涉的時候，每到天晚了，就揀着乾燥的高地過夜。這裏的蚊蟲也相當多，日落以後，無數的吮血魔王從鹹湖中飛出來。所以有牲畜的話，更要特別留心，否則在寂靜的夜裏，可以聽到羊羣的亂奔和哀叫，正在躱避蚊羣的襲擊，或者在次日早晨，便可看到皮膚血淋淋的馬，爲了發癢，和車輪極力地磨擦着。</p>
<p>東三省的森林中，一塊白的蓬帳布可以被蚊蟲停滿而成黑色。若是將捕蟲網在空中搖動一會，即可以有磅多的蚊蟲捉住，牠們所有的血集合起來，據估計達一品脫以上。是以在樹林裹行走，必須戴上面紗和手套。倘使皮膚露出外面，幾百蚊子就紛紛來吮血，要傷處回復原狀，一定需要二三個星期。</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>禽滑釐</h3>
<p>— 祝敔</p>
<p>——艾子新解之二</p>
<p>艾子有一天講一段故事。</p>
<p>三皇時代有個人叫田巴，住在稷下的地方，自稱辦事最精，任何大問題都能經他迎刃而解。大家對他佩服得不得了。　　田巴有個弟子叫禽滑釐，學至了他老師不少高見妙論。</p>
<p>一天，禽滑釐傲視闊步地在街上走，忽被一個老婆子拖住。</p>
<p>「田巴的高足，老媼有個問題想問」。老婆子說。</p>
<p>「儘管問來，我禽滑釐遝不會逢到過不能解決的問題」</p>
<p>老婆子說「馬鬃向上而短，馬尾向下而長，是什麽緣故呢？」</p>
<p>「喔哈哈」！那位邏輯專家笑了起來，「那容易得很啊，馬鬃向上，表示倔强，所以天罰它短；馬尾向下，表示謙虛，所以天賜它長」。</p>
<p>「但是，禽先生，頭髪這樣儸强地上搶爲什麽長？鬍鬚這樣謙虛地下垂爲什麼短？」</p>
<p>「這個啊……」禽滑釐的邏輯碰了壁，沒辦法，說了，「讓我去問老師吧。請你在這裹等等，我還要給你千只貝壳的賞。」</p>
<p>禽先生大汗滿面地到了田巴家裏，氣喘喘地報吿一切，說怎樣以逆順之理解決了馬毛，但解決不了人毛，最後加了一句：</p>
<p>「先生，那個死老婆子還在外面等候我們的賞金！」</p>
<p>田巴足足想了一個時辰，沒有方法回答，領了弟子由後門溜走，心理想：「幸虧是小事。若是國家大事那才怎麼好？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>說着：他就拉開了一扇小門想跨出去。</p>
<p>「時候已經不早了，還不想睡嗎？」秋海棠望着他的背影說。</p>
<p>「睡不睡倒沒有關係。」玉崑的身子已經在門外了。「今晚你女兒已回來了，我不能再跟你在一屋子裏睡，回頭叫小狗子給我在地上舖幾綑麥桿兒，你就不用問我幾時回來！。」</p>
<p>他的聲音越說越遠，最後一句話，秋海棠簡直祇聽淸楚了一半。</p>
<p>玉崑這一决上樟樹屯來，實際上已不願再跟秋海棠提起羅湘綺的事了，但梅實一見了他，却就禁不住連想起三年前他怎樣到這裏來，勸他父親上北平去和她母親相見的那一番情形了。</p>
<p>因爲心裏有着這麽一重心事，上了坑以後，一直睡不熟，但秋海裳問她的關於學堂裏的許多話，她却也是答非所問；秋海棠聽了，還道她太疲倦而就想睡的緣故，便不忍再問她絮聒，忙也靜下心，默默地睡去。</p>
<p>結果倒是老的先睡熟了，小的却還儘在坑上翻身。</p>
<p>「不知道媽現在一個人在那裏？」她閉上眼睛，深深地思索着。「趙老伯總應該是知道的。明兒一定要向他打聽一個明白，即使爸爸不讓我立刻找去見她，可是祇要開了學，我好歹就可以跟她通信了……。（一八六）</p>
<h3>狗裝假牙</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>近年牙科醫術之進步與發展，實造福人羣不鮮。不但患有牙疾之病人，可以不再受無謂之痛苦，即年高牙脫之老翁，亦均得重享咀嚼之樂趣。最近美國支加哥有一牙科技師，畜狗一頭，牙齒多已脫落。該技師見而憐之，乃爲裝置假牙一套，使其愛犬於狂吠之時，仍能顯露其可大怖之白牙，而於食物之時，亦不致感受無齒之不便矣。</p>
<p>現在有多少人不這樣「妙論風生」呢，即使對於國家大事？</p>

<p>（一）通天教主桃李盈門（下）</p>
<p>雪艷琴·毛劍佩·杜麗雲·華慧麟·新艷秋·章遏雲·馬艷雲·胡碧蘭·趙岫雲。朱超華·王玉蓉·張雲燕·鄧德芹·趙金蓉·馮余芙·王余蘭·金和茗·侯玉蘭。白玉薇·張貫珠·嚴月秋·楊艷霞·張梅雲·（以上女性）等五十餘人。此外尙有票友不少，未曾列入。但以實際論，上述五十人未必都能算是瑤卿的弟子，像梅蘭芳·王蕙芳。姜妙香均係陳石頭德霖之門徒。瑤卿爲陳門六大弟子之一，（所謂六大弟子者即王瑤卿·王蕙芳·梅蘭芳·姜妙香·王琴儂·姚玉芙·與蘭芳·蕙芳·妙香，固屬同門師兄弟也。至於尙小雲·荀慧生·小翠花，都是科班出身，程硯秋係榮蝶仙之徒，爲瑤卿之再傳弟子。這些人後來向瑤卿請益，寄名爲師，或許有之，斷不能稱王門入室弟子也。今瑤卿每言桃李之衆，必將四大名旦列入其間，未免虛張聲勢矣。至於瑤卿最得意之弟子，坤角不論，男伶中，當推趙桐珊（芙蓉草）程玉菁二人。桐珊南來已久，比較玉菁與瑤卿最爲接近，瑤卿對玉菁愛護備至，一切優於儕輩，瑤卿獨有之傑作「烈火旗」，「忠烈鴦鴛」，僅授玉菁一人。瑤卿嘗對人云：「我能之藝，玉菁無不能之。」瑤卿之厚於玉菁由是可見一斑。而玉菁在王門因得師寵，乃有不可一世之槪，同門中咸以「大師兄」呼之。允以一般坤角對此大師兄無不執禮甚恭，蓋王門之女弟子學戲，多係由玉菁代表老師說戲，賢如章遏雲新艷秋輩，亦復如是，故王門桃李雖衆，在古瑁軒上聲勢赫赫者，則唯程君玉菁一人而已。</p>
<h3>「實音」普及塲</h3>
<p>— 伯益</p>
<p>對於那些認實音一週年音樂會爲難得聽到的好演奏會的朋友們，這里是一個非常好的消息。實騐音樂社已決定在後天＝八月十八日假座福煦路俄國藝術劇院舉行一次普及塲。時間遝是晚上八點鐘。</p>
<p>在非「音樂通」的朋輩之間談真情為，一向對這合唱演出式覺得不易接受，我們都有一個敎堂式合唱的不良印，象因而發生一種偏見，那是認爲合唱一種聲部多餘和人力浪費的合作。</p>
<p>但實音的社員却有着他們的「說服經」，我遇到兩個都向我作如下的解釋，即假如我能聽得懂的話，便刀能聽懂他們的合唱。</p>
<p>這話是有兩種聽法的：一是演奏得使人理解，二是幼稚是只消聽聽詞句。我去聽，我便馬上懂了他們的話。</p>
<p>我們愛實音的合唱，正因爲他歌頌需要歌頌的一切。「從邊疆到邊疆」可以作爲我保衞國土之安全的戰歌，「普天同哭」爲我們殉難的英雄的憤怒，而「囚徒歌」和「逃亡」那直接是一種控訴了。</p>
<p>生活決定趣味。我不敢說每個人都能愛好實音所介紹的作品，但我敢於向祖國不甘低首於夢幻的兒女們介紹說：道音樂會決不使你失望。</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Agreement on Cooperation Plan: Rapid Developments Expected in the Current Situation; Possibility of the Two Nations’ Accord Becoming an Alliance; British Government Announces Ban on Commodity Exports to Japan</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 15th – Britain today anticipates rapid developments in Anglo-American cooperation regarding the war. Diplomatic and political commentators state that, as naval and air force leaders of both Britain and the United States were present during the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, the outcome of this meeting may lead to active US participation in the war. It is believed that the separate meetings of the British and American naval, land, and air force leaders are equivalent to staff consultations, and it is believed that they focused on the war in the Atlantic and Japan. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" stated, "A consensus on unified action that the two nations can take in these two important areas has clearly been reached."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 15th – Observers here today stated that the consultation between Churchill and President Roosevelt, as well as their talks with British and American military leaders, will inevitably lead the United States to further concentrate its military strength to support Britain and the Soviet Union. However, they indicated that this assistance would not reach the level of actual combat. Although this important meeting of Anglo-American leaders is not enough in itself to bring the United States closer to actual war, the decisions taken at this meeting will result in closer cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the actual effect will be to increase the United States' involvement in the outcome of the war. Responsible parties declared that President Roosevelt has created an Anglo-American accord, which could be a prelude to a future military alliance. The eight-point program for post-war peace goals reflects the attitude of the US government and serves as the basis for the accord, which can be developed into a formal alliance when international crises require it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th – The general sentiment in Washington today is that Britain and the United States will soon take decisive parallel measures to implement the policies agreed upon at the maritime conference between Churchill and Roosevelt. Well-informed diplomatic sources here believe that the outcome of this meeting will far exceed a joint declaration stating peaceful aims. Some officials believe that President Roosevelt may continue to announce details of the maritime conference in a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 15th – The American sentiment reflected in newspapers and radio currently increasingly believes that the scope of the talks between the US President and the British Prime Minister extends far beyond war aims. Many editorial writers and radio commentators point out that this declaration has little meaning without planned actions to back it up, so they all expect action. The interventionist faction in the United States now expects action to follow words, while the isolationist faction darkly hints at the secret role the US President is now undertaking.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 15th – "The New York Times" editorial today stated that the era of American isolation is now over, and the era in which the United States assumes responsibility in this world war has now begun. This Anglo-American joint declaration will guide the efforts of Britain and the United States and measure their progress until the war ends and peace is established.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – The British government has announced new economic actions against Japan. The Board of Trade has issued an order, effective August 15th, prohibiting all exports to Japan, including Karafuto Island, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Manchuria, all under Japanese administration, except for those with a license from the Board of Trade. Export licenses previously issued for shipment to the above-mentioned areas are now all canceled.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 15th – It is widely believed that this measure by the British government is the first strong action following the Anglo-American meeting. Observers say that this move is to demonstrate to Japan that Britain and the United States are determined to maintain the status quo in the Far East. This move also indicates that Britain and the United States will take even tougher measures if necessary to prevent further aggression that directly affects the interests of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th – The British Board of Trade's recent prohibition of certain goods to Japan has not caused a reaction from the Japanese, because trade between Britain and Japan has virtually stopped since the outbreak of the war. It is generally believed that the new ban has very little impact on Japan.</p>
<h3>Amau Succeeds Ohashi as Japanese Vice Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th – Officials have announced that former Ambassador to Italy, Eiji Amau, has been appointed as Vice Foreign Minister to replace Ohashi.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th – An observer familiar with Far Eastern affairs commented on Amau's appointment as Japanese Vice Foreign Minister, saying that given the criticism from some extreme pro-Axis newspapers in Japan of Foreign Minister Toyoda and their urging to appoint someone who thoroughly understands how to implement Japan's determined policies as Vice Foreign Minister, Amau's appointment is particularly noteworthy. This is because Amau has long been considered to be in the faction of Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, who is recognized by both Japanese and foreigners as a more cautious figure who does not favor continued adventurism.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Australian Reinforcements Arrive in Singapore to Strengthen Defenses</h3>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 15th – Officials have announced that a strong Australian military force has arrived in Singapore to strengthen defenses. This reinforcement includes various units, including airmen, which will further strengthen the defense of Malaya. The arrival of a large number of Australian troops to reinforce defenses demonstrates that Australia is determined to assist Malaya in deterring aggression in the South Pacific. Authoritative sources have also stated that the number of Australian troops arriving to reinforce defenses is extremely large, the largest military force ever seen arriving in Malaya to reinforce defenses. This is the third batch of British troops to arrive here in two weeks. The troops include infantry, artillery, service corps, engineering corps, and field ambulance units. Although the troops coming here also carry equipment, most of the equipment, such as Bren guns, anti-tank guns, and motorized transport vehicles, has already arrived in advance. The British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Brooke-Popham, and the Commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, Bennett, both delivered speeches welcoming the newly arrived Australian troops.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 15th – The arrival of fresh Australian troops today is seen by the local population as a symbol of Australia's determination to make Singapore its first line of defense. It also indicates that Britain, Australia, and their allies in the Pacific are now adopting an unyielding policy to resist any country's attempt to interfere with the freedom of the people in this region. The tens of thousands of British, Australian, and Indian troops currently stationed in Malaya are the best barrier against any further aggression. The welcome of the Australian troops by the people of Malaya today is due to the feeling that the region is now safer than ever.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 15th – The Military Advisory Committee met all day but did not issue a formal statement. It is reported that the committee thoroughly discussed the overall situation in the Far East and other international issues. It is believed that the issue of Menzies going to London was also mentioned, but it was felt that the issue should be decided by Parliament. The War Cabinet and the full Cabinet will meet in Sydney on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>US Far East Army Commander Urges Soldiers to Serve With Dedication</h3>

<h3>Thailand Eager to Maintain Peace; US Minister to Thailand Replaced; Japanese and Thai Envoys Promoted</h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 15th – The parliament passed a government emergency bill at dusk yesterday, establishing a Ministry of Transportation. The bill was passed in one session. At the same time, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it denied that the US Minister to Thailand, Grant, had suggested using American military aid to change Thailand's pro-Japanese policy. The statement said, "There is no factual basis for such suggestions. Thailand's policy is to be friends with everyone." It also said that Grant's meeting with Prime Minister Songgram aimed to enhance the friendship between the two countries. At the same time, current affairs commentator Sanya has been continuously broadcasting a peaceful speech for three nights, based on the "spirit of the Bodhisattva," saying that the government intends to make peaceful proposals to all relevant countries.</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Living Expenses of the Salaried Class</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the freeze on funds, the impact on exchange rates has not been as severe as the impact on commodity prices. Commodity prices have risen suddenly like a hurricane, increasing significantly in an instant. In particular, the control of Dalian oil has been like a stroke, with the most drastic increases. Vegetables and other food items are meant to sustain human life, and trade is supposed to be free, but now even humble items such as green vegetables and bean sprouts are no different from meat in price compared to four years ago. What crime have the Chinese people committed to suffer such misery? Where are the products going, being used exclusively for "common use"? Since this "common use" circle has been imposed on the Chinese people, their lives have been subjected to the hardships of shackles and bonds, which have been increasing day by day. However, although the general public knows that the threat and pressure on life caused by this "common use" are high-handed, painful, suffocating, and groaning, there is no means to measure it, no numbers to represent it. Therefore, although its degree is profound, it is not easy to clearly understand how profound it is, and it is even more difficult to make people see at a glance that it is profound to this extent. Thus, we know that a yardstick is indispensable, just as it is indispensable to know lengths and to understand depths.</p>
<p>So, who is to provide this yardstick? It is the general cost-of-living index. The cost-of-living index uses numbers to indicate the level of general living expenses. What is commonly seen in newspapers is the cost-of-living index for workers. However, life cannot be treated as a single entity. The quality of enjoyment varies greatly, and the degree of sophistication is uneven. There are those who are poor enough to live on baked cakes, and there are those who are so rich that they find it difficult to swallow even the most delicious delicacies. However, those with generous incomes and high-class lifestyles can easily use their resources to hoard and speculate, even if prices are soaring; they can also take advantage of real estate to raise rents, evict tenants, and collect excessive tips. Those who open factories and stores can add everything to the price of goods and pass it on to consumers. In short, they use cunning and plunder to compensate for what they lack. Only the salaried class with fixed incomes sees prices running ahead while their lives fall behind. It is not that their income does not increase at all, but that the rate at which salaries increase is far slower than the rate at which prices rise. Therefore, if we observe from the numbers of living expenses, there is a major expansion and much progress; but if we measure from the enjoyment of life, it is deteriorating day by day, far worse than before, with much regression. This phenomenon of living contradiction is now at its peak. There is already a cost-of-living index for workers, and there is also one for Westerners, so it is not difficult to express their living conditions in numbers. Only the Chinese salaried class, which occupies the main and solid part of society, is withering and suffering under the pressure of life, without the opportunity to be seen by the public. When there is a need for a reasonable adjustment in life, they also suffer from a lack of a yardstick, taking evidence from the worker cost-of-living index. Although the situation of the salaried class and the working class is the same, with the same fixed income, the same labor compensation, and the same being employed, there may be differences in the form of their lives. There is a saying: "A long gown is the most troublesome thing." "Long gown" is a symbol of the salaried class, not that the working class does not wear long gowns. The habit of wearing this long gown adds many expenses to life, and all food, clothing, housing, and transportation are often higher than for workers, while their income may not be better than that of the wage-earning class. The burden of supporting a superficial appearance is a major burden for the salaried class. However, since they do not change their way of life and do not make a factual review, why complain and blame others? Only if the salaried class can present the outline of their living conditions in the same way will the cost-of-living index be complete.</p>
<p>The idea of compiling a cost-of-living index for the salaried class has been around for more than a decade. However, in terms of occupation and work, the improvement of the living conditions of workers at that time was more urgent than that of salaried workers, so the compilation of the worker cost-of-living index was given priority. The investigation of the living expenses of the salaried class has been delayed until now and has not been realized. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is conducting a survey on the living expenses of salaried employees, which is now an urgent task. To compile the cost-of-living index for a certain class, it is necessary to first understand the actual situation of living expenses of a certain class, and then know how much a certain part of the expense accounts for the entire expense, in order to calculate how the rise and fall of a certain part of the commodity price affects a certain part of their life! A household budget survey is to prepare for this work. The bookkeeping households collected now are limited to salaried families, without limiting the industry, excluding farmers, workers, and self-employed persons. Of the household heads' income, those with a monthly income of no more than 1,000 yuan account for 30%, and those with a monthly income of less than 500 yuan account for 70%, with a bias towards lower monthly incomes, which is deeply in line with the meaning of popularization. The bookkeeping period is three months, which is short and easy to complete. Given the large population of the salaried class in Shanghai, and the current difficulty of living, the pain and distress over the current inability to solve life problems, and the anxiety and worry over how to survive in the future, there is now an opportunity to contribute their actual necessary living expenses, which only takes a few minutes of recording labor, to society. This is a direct calculation for themselves and an indirect calculation for the entire salaried family. With the increase in knowledge among the salaried class in Shanghai, and the increasing number of educated housewives, household bookkeeping is not a difficult task. It can be certain that the number of families responding will be more than this number. However, the more households that keep accounts, the more precise and reliable the analysis and comparison will be. If the bookkeeping time can be appropriately extended, the more comprehensive the categories of living expenses included will be, and the closer it will be to the actual situation of life. This will ultimately depend on the thickness of the manpower and financial resources on the compilation side, and the amount of support from the salaried class's bookkeeping families. However, since the Industrial and Social Affairs Department has already taken this initiative, the completion is not far away, and we are willing to wait and see.</p>
<h3>Report of French Troops Opening Up the Yunnan-Guangxi Border: No Information Received by the Chinese Side; If France Assists Japan in Invading the Chinese Border, Chinese Troops Will Take Action</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman said yesterday that four Japanese mechanized units, each carrying 150 tanks, had been transported from Japan to Manchuria, two of which had already arrived, and the remaining two were on their way. From August 18th, Chinese or foreigners will not be allowed to enter the three northeastern provinces. He also said that this area has not received reports of French troops arriving at the Yunnan-Guangxi border, but if French troops assist Japanese troops in attacking the Chinese border, Chinese troops will take action. Japanese troops in Vietnam are currently advancing south rather than north. The spokesman mentioned the battle in western Hubei, saying that Japanese troops who had invaded near Hao Xue in Yichang had been repelled, with 4,000 Japanese casualties. Chinese troops are currently attacking the Japanese bases in Shashi and other places (Reuters, 15th).</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a reception for foreign journalists today, Major General Bao Kai, a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, was asked by a reporter whether it was true that French troops had been transferred to the Yunnan-Vietnam border, as reported by the British side. Bao immediately replied that this area had not received any information to confirm this report (Havas, 14th).</p>
<p>Hanoi – Officials recently issued a communiqué stating, "Foreign parties, especially the British, have been spreading rumors in recent days that French troops stationed in Vietnam have concentrated near the borders of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, covering Japanese troops invading China. The British have also issued a message from Chongqing stating that these French troops are covering the flanks of the Japanese troops. Since relations between China and France have deteriorated, this move is not surprising. It must be solemnly stated that this false report is entirely a consistent style of anti-French propaganda, fabricated out of thin air, and completely untrue" (Havas, 14th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Yunnan</h3>

<h3>Since the Past Four Years, Results of the Chinese Air Force: More Than 1,500 Japanese Planes Shot Down; More Than 1,000 Japanese Air Force Personnel Killed</h3>
<p>Chengdu – "August 14th" is the second Chinese Air Force Day. The Aviation Commission announced the results of the Chinese Air Force's battles over the past four years, totaling more than 1,500 Japanese planes shot down, 1,208 Japanese Air Force personnel killed with verifiable names, and even more without verification. However, based on reliable estimates of the number of Japanese plane losses, it should be over 4,000. 69 prisoners were captured. Among them were renowned Air Force personnel such as the "King of Fighters," the "King of Bombers," and the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the fighter squadron, all buried in the vast Chinese wilderness (13th dispatch).</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life in Chongqing Commemorate Air Force Day</p>
<p>Chongqing – The rally to commemorate Air Force Day in the capital and the General Association for Comforting the Troops, as well as the evening party to entertain Air Force officers and soldiers, were held together on the 14th evening. Chairman Gu Zhenggang hoped that the citizens would expand the aircraft donation campaign, the national defense science campaign, and the gliding movement. The attendees responded enthusiastically on the spot and passed a telegram to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to pay tribute to the Air Force officers and soldiers (14th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Declaration of Eight Principles Lays the Foundation for the Future of Democracy; Echoes Wilson's Fourteen Points; Those Who Use Force to Subdue Others Will Ultimately Fail</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th – Secretary of State Hull stated that the joint declaration by Churchill and Roosevelt is a document of basic principles and shared basic policy concepts in implementation. These principles and concepts are recognized by all civilized countries and have always been supported by the world. However, since some countries decided to launch a universal movement to destroy the structure of civilized relations between countries and establish rule by barbaric force to conquer others, these principles have been hindered and remain so to this day.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 14th – After the official release of the joint declaration by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, the various rumors about the President's actions in recent days have finally been clarified. During the meeting between the President and Churchill, the White House and the Department of the Navy maintained strict secrecy, issuing only brief communiqués about the President's travels. Political figures here believe that this declaration was expected and does not indicate surprise. They only indicate that the eight principles listed in the declaration echo the fourteen points proposed by President Wilson during World War I. On the surface, it is a reaffirmation of the common desire to defeat Germany, but in reality, it adds some active factors to the Anglo-American cooperation. The rumors that Britain and Germany are about to sign a peace treaty can be dispelled by this declaration. In short, the specific results of this meeting will inevitably be seen in the facts one after another in the future, and it is undoubtedly certain that the two sides have decided to act in unison in Europe and the Far East, although this is not mentioned in the official communiqué. Regarding this matter, the authorities' intention is probably not to allow domestic isolationist elements to regain their strength to oppose any Anglo-American agreement, so they do not want to make the Anglo-American political connection too close to give grounds for attack. As for the nature of the cooperation between the two sides, it is not difficult to know from the participation of senior naval and land army officers of the two countries in the meeting at the same time. Moreover, after attending the meeting, British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook also accompanied US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall here to deploy everything on a resolution to supply the countries fighting against Germany with military supplies from the United States.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 15th – The highest government officials have reserved formal criticism of the joint declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill because they have not yet received its official original text. However, they stated that they believe this meeting is extremely important and is extremely important for all of humanity in the world. As China is a member of the anti-aggression group, it has a direct and deep concern for the plans to reorganize the world in the future. An official indicated that if the disarmament of the Axis powers is implemented, it will result in the use of force against Japan, because Japan will certainly not be willing to be disarmed without war. Following the joint declaration was the news that Britain banned exports to Japan, which has had a very good impression on official and private circles here. Newspapers here all published the joint declaration on the front page, but because the news arrived here quite late, they have not yet commented on it. A senior official told United Press that the important point is that Britain and the United States have dedicated themselves to defeating Nazi tyranny. If this matter can be completed, the problems of Japan and the Far East will be automatically solved. If Britain and the United States can shift their joint attention to this aspect, then Japan will not be able to continue its current behavior. Based on the general Chinese view, the two points that there will be no territorial changes and that the people have the right to freely choose their own government are extremely important. Qualified observers pointed out that China has repeatedly stated its war goals, including recovering all territories lost to Japan, and that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that if Japanese troops completely withdraw from Chinese territory, China is prepared to conclude peace.</p>
<h3>Pacific War Crisis Spurs Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting: Two Giants to Conduct Thorough Exploration of the Entire European and Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>London, Associated Press, 15th - It is widely believed that the threat of war in the Pacific is one of the reasons for President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's historic meeting at sea. Now that this meeting has been announced, we can declare that it was initiated by President Roosevelt. Although Mr. Hopkins traveled to the United States several times before the war to reach out to Churchill, he never met with President Roosevelt. However, when Churchill was Prime Minister, he often spoke with the President by telephone, raising numerous issues, especially regarding prompt and effective assistance to the Soviet Union. Other issues requiring exploration include the supply of American provisions to the UK and the Near East, and the transport of American-made tanks and other raw materials to the war zone. Vichy's submission to the Axis, including the fate of French Northeast Africa and the defense of the Western Hemisphere, will necessitate new policies by Britain and the United States. More distant issues, such as Germany's influence in Iran, are also attracting widespread attention. Many who were formerly apprehensive now realize for the first time that Germany can be defeated by Soviet resistance. Germany is now deploying four-fifths of its national strength to attack the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom and the United States must urgently take firm action. Reliable sources say that all of these issues are sufficient for Roosevelt and Churchill to discuss at length. If these facts are still not sufficient reason for the meeting, then Japan's disregard for the warnings of the United Kingdom and the United States is undoubtedly the direct cause of the meeting. The recent smooth progress of the British-Australian-Dutch conference necessitates that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill discuss the second phase of defense measures in the Pacific. If Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands can establish a defense alliance, the United States will endorse it. At that time, Washington may explicitly declare that the territorial integrity of the Dutch East Indies is within the scope of American security. Observers believe that President Roosevelt has thoroughly reviewed with Prime Minister Churchill the consequences that Japan's further southward advance into Thailand and its continued troop increase in Siberia would entail. They may have even received recent intelligence from London stating that Japan plans to double its current 240,000 troops stationed in Manchuria by early September. It is reported that Japan has transferred two divisions from its home country and two divisions from China to Manchuria. The Japanese army previously stationed in Manchuria already consisted of as many as sixteen divisions. It is also rumored that Tokyo plans to dispatch an additional ten to eleven divisions to Manchuria.</p>
<p>Enhanced Anglo-American Cooperation Greatly Excites London</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 15th - The Roosevelt-Churchill meeting at sea was proposed by President Roosevelt, and Churchill gladly accepted it, traveling far from his country to hold this important conversation. The Dominions were not formally consulted, so Churchill only represents the British government. Now that the joint declaration has been issued, the British are very excited. All the evening newspapers published special editions, recognizing this as evidence of the increasingly close relationship between Britain and the United States in general policy, and as a very important event in the war. The participation of land, sea, and air leaders in this meeting proves that the entire war situation has been discussed in detail, and that various issues concerning the European and Far Eastern situations have been studied in an atmosphere of complete secrecy and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Ottawa, Reuters, 15th - Canadians believe that the eight war aims jointly declared by Britain and the United States represent lofty ideals, which all peace-loving people should support. The close cooperation between Britain and the United States is especially evident in this, increasing people's confidence. The statement mentions governments cooperating with Germany, naturally paying special attention to the solution to the Japanese situation. As far as is known, no Canadian officials participated in this sea meeting. Canadian Prime Minister King commented on the meeting, expressing deep satisfaction, believing that this move could make the future relationship between Britain and the United States even closer, and stating that this joint declaration is worthy of the most thorough study and will have a significant impact on world public opinion. This document expresses complete understanding and cooperation in the conduct of the war, as well as complete agreement on the ultimate goal of a peace that is victorious rather than retaliatory.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Policy Unanimously Supported Across America</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 15th - Yesterday morning, people in Washington had already expected exciting developments in the situation and were not disappointed. Hundreds of millions of people across the country were listening intently to the announcement that officials had promised to issue beforehand, but soon learned that the announcer was a British spokesman in London and that what he announced was the process and important results of the important meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt at sea. At about 9 a.m., all radio stations rebroadcasted the statement made in London by British Lord President Attlee. After the rebroadcast was completed, the radio announcers told the audience that the White House had issued the same document. Some observers, upon hearing this announcement, said that this was almost the same as a joint agreement that the United States would support the war alongside Britain. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also expressed his opinion after hearing the broadcast, recognizing that this document represents general American public opinion, from which it can be seen that Congress will definitely support the President. It is widely believed that this Anglo-American declaration is an outline of the conditions for a peace treaty that the United States can support or even jointly guarantee. Observers here see the most important feature of this as preventing Hitler from launching his peace offensive in the near future and ensuring that American public opinion fully supports the government. Because there is a segment of domestic public opinion that previously questioned what the future would hold and why the Allies did not declare their peace goals, they will now recognize that this document has declared the nature of the peace treaty at this time, as any country can. As far as is known here, President Roosevelt is still at sea. This joint declaration was telegraphed to the White House for publication from a location unknown to the public. Before this declaration was issued, anxiously awaiting news reporters had gathered in the White House reception room. After the printed joint declaration was issued, the reporters rushed to grab a copy and quickly went to the telephone rooms and telegraph offices to transmit the document. At the same time, members of Congress, such as Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, also went to radio stations after listening to British Attlee's broadcast to express their satisfying opinions on this document to the people through the airwaves. The initial reactions everywhere are satisfactory. When the President returns to the capital, he will definitely receive a grand welcome. The principles that the President cherishes most, which have been repeatedly seen in the President's fireside chats since the outbreak of the European war, are now all included in this joint declaration. Items four and five embody the doctrine that President Roosevelt used to launch his new initiatives. Item six contains one of the President's most important beliefs. Item seven is the doctrine of freedom of the seas, which the President has most strongly supported and repeatedly declared as American policy when announcing the U.S. Navy and Air Force patrols of the Atlantic Ocean a few weeks ago. Item eight is perhaps the most important principle, in other words, Britain and the United States have decided that all aggressor nations, namely Germany, Italy, and Japan, must be disarmed. An important American figure told a Reuters reporter that this document is more concise than the Four Freedoms that the President announced in his fireside chat in May. Those who previously opposed the President's policies, such as Senators Austin Barkley and Johnson, and Representative Bloom, immediately issued opinions praising this document.</p>
<p>Situation of Sea Meeting: White House Issues Photos</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 15th - The U.S. cruiser Augusta, formerly the flagship of the U.S. fleet, which was docked in the Huangpu River during the Shanghai battles in 1937, was the location of the historically important meeting between U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill. Photos released by the White House last night showed the leaders of the two great democratic nations sitting in wicker chairs under awnings on the ship's deck, talking to each other. Assistant Secretary of State Welles and the U.S. President's two sons in military uniforms were also on board. Another photo showed participants in the meeting including Pound, a senior official from the British Admiralty, Dill, the British Chief of the General Staff, Stark and Marshall, the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Chief of Staff of the Army, as well as Hopkins and Harriman. King, Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, also attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Reactions from Axis Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 15th - The intense reactions of Japanese newspapers and semi-official sources to the Anglo-American declaration may indicate that there is still no hope of reversing the decision on Japan's future policy. The Asahi Shimbun, traditionally known for its conservatism, launched its most violent attack on democratic nations tonight. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun also called the declaration a treacherous international conspiracy.</p>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 15th - Political circles here say that the Anglo-American declaration is stale news and there is no reason to attach importance to it.</p>
<p>Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 15th - The Foreign Ministry said last night that Roosevelt and Churchill issued a joint declaration in the hope of salvaging their residual situation. The declaration aims to make people in the world deeply believe that Roosevelt and Churchill are both very concerned about a solemn and lasting peace plan. According to Berlin's opinion, the so-called Roosevelt and Churchill having no territorial ambitions whatsoever is actually an exposure of the ambition to make the Treaty of Versailles, which has created all the inequalities in Europe and used flesh and blood to construct the British Empire, continue to be effective.</p>
<h3>Beaverbrook Arrives in Washington to Discuss Arms Supply Issues</h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 15th - British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook has recently arrived in Washington. Beaverbrook attended the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting and is now in Washington to discuss issues concerning the supply of arms.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 15th - After arriving in Washington, British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook told reporters that Britain has obtained the benefit of trillions of dollars worth of value under the lease-lend program, but Britain still has many needs. Answering reporters' continuous questions, Beaverbrook said that what we need are food, tanks, and airplanes, especially bombers. We have obtained surprising results from American-made bombers. In fact, the best bombers we have come from the United States. We already have many tank divisions and tank brigades. Although we have manufactured many tanks, it is still not enough. We want to obtain tanks. Beaverbrook was unwilling to add anything to what had already been published regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, nor would he say that Hopkins participated in the discussion. Beaverbrook revealed that when he was Minister of Aircraft Production, Britain received a total of 2,200 American aircraft, many of which had to be modified to install British-made machine guns. By the time he left office, 1,200 had gone to war.</p>
<h3>Hiranuma's Condition Unchanged, Motivation for Assassination Attributed to Nazi Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Associated Press, 15th - Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information Bureau, declared today that Baron Hiranuma, who was wounded in yesterday's assassination attempt, showed no change in his condition last night. Regarding the assassination and the extent of Hiranuma's injuries, it is not yet possible to know more. The police are still investigating the circumstances of the assassination. Japanese newspapers today strongly condemned the assassination attempt on Hiranuma. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun declared that the assassination was terrible, painful, and regrettable, and expressed the hope that Hiranuma could return to work soon and continue his efforts. The newspaper also said that in the encirclement of Britain and the United States, Japan should show a united and harmonious front. The Chugai Shimbun pointed out that since the Meiji era, there have been ten cabinet members who have been assassinated, but this is not enough to prove that Japan is an uncivilized country, but it also cannot deny that there are fanatical and impetuous people among the Japanese, whose minds are narrow and cannot understand the other side of the facts. The newspaper said that although Hiranuma had allowed the zealous to deliberate at length, he was still unavoidably attacked. The newspaper also said that zeal is enough to make the country rich and strong, but some instigators are abusing the old San Francisco wireless broadcast carried by a certain foreign news agency, saying that Hiranuma's assassination was due to his relationship with the army, which is contrary to the facts. Taipei Public News Agency, 15th, Tokyo - As of last night, the government has not yet announced anything about the condition of Hiranuma Kiichirō, Minister without Portfolio. Hiranuma was assassinated in his private residence yesterday morning. International News Service, 15th, Washington - Today, confidential Far Eastern diplomatic reports were received here stating that the attempted assassination of Japanese Minister of State Hiranuma Kiichirō was part of a German conspiracy. It is said that Germany is planning to instigate a military coup in Japan to make Japan join the war.</p>

(3) The Japanese troops invading Wujiadian (southwest of Pingchang) advanced in three routes on the 10th, one towards Gaolidian, one towards Xiaoduandian, and one towards Heishandian, attempting to encircle Pingchangg Pass from Ganyangtai. After being severely attacked and defeated by the Chinese troops, they crossed east of the Huai River again and invaded Pingchang Pass. The Chinese troops are currently encircling them.

Many Japanese soldiers were killed and four Japanese blockhouses were destroyed. (3) According to people coming from Shaoyuan, Yamada, the Japanese battalion commander stationed in Duancun west of Shaoyuan, was killed on July 28 when he led Japanese soldiers to scout positions in the Taoshan area. He was suddenly shot by the artillery of a certain Chinese unit. Yamada was killed on the spot, and many Japanese soldiers were also killed. (Telegraph from 12th)</p>
<p>The Saying that Japanese Troops are Leaving Guangzhou is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Hong Kong: It was learned here today that the repeated reports in local Chinese newspapers that Japanese troops will withdraw from the occupied areas of Guangdong Province on October 10 have no basis. The Japanese High Command currently has no intention of withdrawing Japanese troops from the occupied areas of Guangdong Province. The Japanese side admits that about 11,000 Japanese troops have been withdrawn from the Guangzhou area to serve in Vietnam and Manchuria, but sufficient troops remain to guard all important strongholds near Guangzhou, Shantou, Kowloon, and Zhongshan. The semi-official Chongqing newspaper Ta Kung Pao recently carried news from Shaoguan stating that the Japanese women, children, and factories in Guangzhou, Shantou, and Kowloon have been ordered to evacuate immediately because the Japanese army may launch another southward advance soon, so there is fear that the aforementioned cities may be subjected to retaliatory bombings. There are only rumors that the Pearl River will be blockaded. The American ship Falun, the French ship Fashan, and the Japanese ship Shiragane Maru are still maintaining navigation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. (National Festival Telegraph from 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents of Hong Kong Leave One After Another: Funds Frozen, Nothing to Do, More Than 400 People Prepare to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Japanese residents of Hong Kong are leaving one after another because their funds have been frozen and Japan has banned exports, so there is nothing to do. There are still about 400 people remaining, who are now selling their property and preparing to withdraw. (Reuters Telegraph from 15th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Japanese Consul-General Yano announced today that Japanese residents of Hong Kong will return home because commercial activities have come to a standstill due to the impact of the freeze. Yano said that 30 women and children and some men are scheduled to return to Japan today. There are still about 400 Japanese residents here who are going through the procedures of selling their businesses before returning home. (Associated Press City Telegraph from 15th)</p>
<p>Freezing Funds in Hong Kong Does Not Hinder Business for Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Commissioner of Foreign Exchange Control in Hong Kong, Mr. De, told reporters that the freezing of Chinese funds in Hong Kong was at the request of the Chinese government, so the measures are designed to not hinder business for Chinese merchants. If the Chinese government has any proposals, it will be happy to adopt them. Furthermore, remittances for the purchase of cotton yarn and grain will be approved as much as possible.

<h3>German Troops Invading Soviet Union Suffer Heavy Losses, Difficult to Realize Original Schedule, Soviets Withdraw from Two Towns on the Bug River, Report of Odessa Falling Proven Incorrect</h3>
<p>Moscow, Reuters, 15th - The heavy price that the Germans have paid for invading the Soviet Union can be glimpsed in the numbers of German losses announced here yesterday. According to the Soviets, these numbers are not yet complete, and they include the destruction of a German tank regiment, eleven German divisions, and thirteen German regiments. Another twenty-one divisions have lost more than half their strength. The battle for Smolensk, lasting more than three weeks, which gave the Soviet army time to deploy new positions, is part of the price that Germany has paid. The casualties among the soldiers will be difficult to replenish. Hitler's original schedule was for General von Kleist's German troops to enter Leningrad on August 1, General Bock's German troops to enter Moscow, and General Rundstedt's German troops to occupy Kiev. However, it has now been delayed by two weeks and has not yet succeeded. The German troops that have been destroyed include the 39th Tank Regiment, the 8th, 18th, 16th, 19th, and 20th Tank Divisions, the 27th Mechanized Division, the 5th, 68th, 110th, and 137th Infantry Divisions, and the famous Death's Head SS Division. Among the German divisions that have lost more than half their strength are five tank divisions and five SS divisions. The trend of the Smolensk salient is that, under the current circumstances, an attack on Moscow is hopeless. Judging from the communique, in addition to attacking Ukraine, the German army has resumed its offensive in the northwest in the past two days in an attempt to seize the famous swamp of Staraya Russa south of Lake Ilmen. This move by the German army is intended to cut off the railway traffic between Leningrad and Moscow sixty miles southeast of Staraya Russa. However, the terrain there is difficult and will be impassable for weeks, so if the German army does not win immediately, it will be in a predicament.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 15th - Soviet Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau Lozovsky yesterday denied the German claim that they had occupied Odessa, saying, "This is just wishful thinking." Lozovsky also denied that the Southern Soviet Army had been surrounded. German propaganda is now loudly proclaiming that the German army and its allies have gained advantages in Ukraine. The German official news agency broadcast the news that the Soviet army was making a similar Dunkirk-like withdrawal in the Black Sea. Yesterday's Soviet communique only stated that nothing significant had happened on the lines on Wednesday. The German command boasted, "The Soviet defenses in the Ukrainian heartland are nearing complete collapse under the pressure of the continuous pursuit of the German, Hungarian, and Italian troops." It also said, "Odessa has been surrounded, Nikolaev (seventy miles northeast of Odessa) has been attacked from the east and west, and the large Soviet force west of the Bug River will be annihilated. German mobile units are advancing towards the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and have occupied the Krivoy Rog iron sand area, which produces 19 million tons of iron sand annually, so the Soviets have lost more than 61 percent of their iron production quota and have suffered extremely serious military and economic blows." Furthermore, the German official news agency claimed that the Soviet forces in Odessa and Nikolaev are withdrawing towards the Black Sea. The troop transports carrying Soviet soldiers were fiercely attacked by the German air force, and the German navy also participated in the battle, dispatching large numbers of warships to fight in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Arctic Ocean, and has blockaded the Soviet northern port of Arkhangelsk. According to news from Stockholm, the Swedish correspondent in Berlin reported that in the Odessa and Ochakov areas along the Black Sea coast, the Soviet army has been surrounded on land and is preparing to retreat from the sea to Crimea and the Caucasus. The German army may have suffered heavy losses in weakening the resistance of the surrounded Soviet army in other areas, so it hopes to destroy them without engaging in costly battles when the Soviet army boards ships to evacuate. The Swedish correspondent also reported that the Germans claimed that the crossings on the Dnieper River were destroyed one by one by German aircraft, and the railway to Leningrad was cut off in several places by German aircraft. The German army is now being transferred east from the Smolensk area and is launching a major attack in the southern area of the vast front in an attempt to seize valuable resources and the oil fields of the Caucasus. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique as follows: On August 14, the Soviet army fought the enemy along the entire line from the White Sea to the Black Sea. The Southern Soviet Army has withdrawn from the towns of Kirovograd and Pervomaisk (on the Bug River northwest of Nikolaev). The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, continued to strike the enemy and destroyed enemy aircraft on the airfields. On the 13th, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 74 enemy aircraft in aerial combat and bombing enemy airfields. The Soviet also lost 27 aircraft. The Baltic Fleet sank a submarine.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Associated Press, 15th - The official communique said yesterday that the enemy forces on Lake Ladoga are fighting fiercely under pressure from our army, and some enemy forces are even trying to withdraw from the lake.</p>
<p>Moscow, Associated Press, 15th - Officials announced today that no German aircraft appeared over Moscow last night. The German air force has not attacked Moscow for two consecutive nights.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Comment on Soviet Withdrawal as Having Strategic Significance</h3>
<p>London, Associated Press, 15th - Authoritative British figures recently commented on the Soviet Union's acknowledgment of its withdrawal from Kirovograd and Pervomaisk in Ukraine, saying that the Soviets have withdrawn to a line east of the Dnieper River, but the German army has not yet shown any signs of crossing any section of the Dnieper River, and stated that if the Soviets withdraw most of their southern forces to the line east of the Dnieper River, this withdrawal would be of strategic value, because the Soviet Union would also be able to build a strong defense to protect the important Donets Basin.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers to Hold Meeting at Month's End to Discuss the Partition of Territories</h3>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 15th - It has been confirmed here that Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and other countries will hold a meeting in Vienna at the end of August. The reason for convening this meeting is that various Axis powers have developed different opinions regarding Germany's "New Europe" plan, and the meeting will resolve issues of territorial distribution. (It is reported that Germany had promised the same territory to several allies, thus causing disputes.) The Turkish press believes that this meeting will inevitably fail because none of the Axis countries are willing to give up territory. As for the ownership of Bitov, Kichevo, and Gostivar, these are particularly difficult issues to resolve, as Italy and Bulgaria are both vying for these cities. In addition, the meeting will also discuss Bulgaria's participation in the war, Finland's formal accession to the Tripartite Pact, and joint actions by countries in the Tripartite Pact against the United States.</p>
<h3>Poland to Send Chargé d'Affaires to Moscow to Promote Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 14th - Following the establishment of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland, the Polish government in London has dispatched Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Retinger to Moscow to promote diplomatic relations between the two countries. Mr. Retinger met with Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov today for discussions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Launch Fundraising Campaign to Aid British Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Singapore, 14th - The General Association of the Nanyang Chinese Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee has decided to hold a seven-day fundraising campaign throughout Malaya to aid victims of the London Blitz, in response to the fundraising campaign led by the Mayor of London. The General Association has obtained the consent of Governor Thomas. In his reply, the Governor stated, "I believe this action by your association demonstrates the Chinese people's recognition that Britain is fighting for world freedom and that the British government is working to protect Malaya."</p>
<h3>New York Financial Institution Sends Personnel to the Far East</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 15th - A major New York financial institution with substantial investments in the Far East has recently sent additional personnel to the Far East via Clipper. This is quite interesting and allows one to infer the trend of the Pacific crisis. The reason is that many employees and their families of the institution had recently been evacuated from the Far East, but now there is a sudden move to send personnel back, indicating a belief that Japan does not want to launch a war that would lead to its own destruction.</p>
<h3>President Coolidge Sends SOS Signal; News Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 15th - This afternoon, rumors are rife here that the "President Coolidge," which left Shanghai yesterday carrying 250 passengers bound for the United States, sent out a distress signal. Enquiries to the American President Lines have so far been unable to confirm it. The naval authorities are also keeping silent on the matter.</p>
<h3>Vichy Elements in Syria Violate Armistice Treaty, Obstructing French Troops from Joining Allied Forces; British Authorities Resolve to Take Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th - Following repeated violations of the armistice treaty by Vichy elements in Syria, it is reported that the Allied forces will now take actions they deem necessary to ensure that Vichy troops can freely choose their allegiance, as stipulated in Article 8 of the armistice treaty. The Allied Commander has had to lodge a special protest against three actions by the Vichy elements that violate the treaty: (1) Former Syrian High Commissioner General Zheng Zi denounced French soldiers willing to join the Free French forces as deserters. (2) The families and baggage of many French soldiers awaiting the opportunity to choose their allegiance have been hurriedly transported to embarkation points. (3) When the armistice treaty was signed, the Vichy authorities sold large quantities of war equipment to civilians. During the negotiations, British prisoners were even taken out of Syria, some even being handed over to Axis control. As a result, General Deng Zi and 34 Vichy officers were also detained. In addition, the obstacles imposed by the Vichy side are too numerous to mention. For example, 50 French soldiers willing to join the Free French forces were arrested by military police in Tripoli. British authorities had to arrest these military police to rescue the detained French soldiers. As of a week ago, several thousand Vichy soldiers had defected to the Allied forces, and the flow has continued unabated. On one day, 60 Vichy officers came to defect. Months ago, Vichy had specially established a headquarters for elite troops to fight the Allied forces in Syria. These troops were sent from France, but they are now gradually defecting to the Allied forces. In the coming days, thousands more Vichy soldiers will surely come to defect. At the same time, the Free French are now showing generosity to Syria. Lebanese people also have a civil aviation school in the Syrian government, and many people have enrolled for training. Syria has linked itself to the Sterling Area to facilitate its economic recovery.</p>
<h3>Recollections of Tagore's Visit to India (II)</h3>
<p>— Xu Baoqian</p>
<p>According to the Professor of Indian Philosophy at International University who explained it to me, Indian opera can be divided into northern and southern schools, and what Tagore advocated was actually a mixture of the two schools, to achieve harmony.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning on the eighth, we participated in the students' prayer meeting, and afterwards, we audited the students' classes, both of which were held outdoors. The most noteworthy point for us was that the number of students in each class was less than fifteen. After the auditing, we went together to a village nearby named Sri-niketan to visit Tagore's rural work (details below). In the afternoon, the faculty and students of the college invited Ms. Lester, the head of the visiting delegation, to speak about the prospects for the new world, and also invited China to build the country. That evening, we left Peace Village.</p>
<p>Tagore's Life</p>
<p>Tagore came from a distinguished family. His father, Devendranath Tagore, was called Mlaharishi (meaning great hermit or master) at the time and lived in Calcutta. Tagore was born on May 6, 1861. According to Tagore's public speech at the Zhenguang Theater in Beijing on May 19, 1924, there were three historical waves with historical significance at that time: the religious reform movement, the new literature movement, and the national self-determination movement. Tagore said that he had made considerable contributions to the second movement. He also said that people often like the new and dislike the old, abandoning their inherent culture to accept Western culture. In fact, the standard for choosing a culture does not lie in whether it is new or old, but in the spiritual value contained in the culture.</p>
<p>Educational Ideal</p>
<p>Tagore was born with a nature that admired nature, loved freedom, and opposed the constraints imposed on children by traditional education. In September 1930, Tagore traveled to Moscow and gave an autobiographical speech to students, which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"When I was young, I also went to school, but I didn't like taking classes in the classroom because I loved nature. Some teachers lacked sympathy for me. They couldn't understand that some children have tender and sensitive hearts, but instead, they added pressure. In fact, children's disobedience is enough to show the failure of the methods used by teachers. When I was thirteen years old, I escaped from school, and I never went back to school again. After escaping from school, I began to study on my own. I lived in seclusion in a place near the Ganges River, mostly living on a small boat. There, I wrote poetry, wrote novels, wrote plays, and had my sweet dreams. Soon, my reputation gradually spread. Many people came from all over to get to know me, and my secluded life could no longer continue.</p>
<p>"I have never run an educational institution. I don't know how I dared to boldly run education, even I myself am inexplicable. However, I am confident that I have deep sympathy for children, and the location I chose is very quiet and beautiful (ie, Peace Village), far away from the evil and turbid environment of the metropolis. This beautiful environment can stimulate the inherent creativity of human beings. There, I gathered five or six children. I not only taught them but also made friends, singing to them. I made musical scores and scripts, and they helped me perform. This is how the school I founded began.</p>
<p>"I try my best to give my students the opportunity to develop and express themselves freely, and I try my best to arouse their interest in nature, music, art, and the countryside. I think this kind of education is the most ideal. However, later the number of students increased, and there had to be considerable changes. The method of charging tuition fees is one end of the change. Because, in the old Indian ideal, teachers not only provided education free of charge but also bore all the needs of students' lives. When the number of people increased, this method naturally could not continue. However, although I later had to charge fees, I still retained the point that teachers and students must live together, and teachers and students must cooperate in various activities. It is a pity that some teachers hired from outside, due to the background of traditional education, sometimes failed to thoroughly understand my educational purpose. Once, a new teacher, because he saw a few students climbing up a tree to prepare their homework, he became very angry and wanted to punish them. At that time, I had to protect these students and tell the gentleman: Don't punish them. Because soon they will go to the evil society, and maybe they will be separated from nature. Even if you want to climb a tree, I am afraid it will be impossible.</p>
<p>"In addition, there is another point that I also pay special attention to. I try my best to create an international atmosphere in the school. I often invite famous people from the East and West to give lectures at the school. In this way, the narrow minds of students can be gradually expanded, and I am confident that I have achieved considerable success in this regard. Finally, there is one more point. I set up many night classes in nearby villages, so that my students can serve as night school teachers. At the same time, they can get many opportunities to practice in the rural undertakings I run. In this way, education and life can be integrated."</p>
<p>After reading the above confession, we can not only know Tagore's life, but also understand Tagore's educational ideals.</p>
<p>Forest Philosophy</p>
<p>"The mission of the forest" runs through Tagore's entire thought and art, like a refrain in a poem. Tagore once said: "The forest is different from the desert, stone, or ocean. It is alive. It nurtures human life. In the forest, the hermits of ancient India realized the harmony between life and the universe, and the unity of truth. Moreover, they recognized from this the chain between self-spirit and the entire universe." In the realization of life (this book is a collection of speeches given by him at Harvard University), Tagore told the audience: "Indian culture originated in the forests, and the forest environment formed the quality of Indian culture. The greatness of the forest did not make people feel small. On the contrary, the forest environment stimulated the inherent creativity of life and expanded human sympathy. Later, agriculture developed, cities rose, and forests gradually decreased, but Indians still miss and remember the civilization of the forest. Therefore, the Indian viewpoint is very different from the Westerners' view that nature is inhuman and must be conquered."</p>
<p>This idea of worshiping nature, making life and nature one, has its own historical and geographical reasons for its formation. But once formed, it has a profound impact on culture. The forest philosophy produced by the environment of Hinduism. When we read Tagore's poems and prose, such as the famous works Chitra and Gi'anjali, this forest philosophy is revealed everywhere. In the Brahmana chapter of Chitra, Tagore describes the scene of the forest school as follows:</p>

<h3>Gauze Cannot Be Compared with Gauze Cloth; Soaring Cotton Prices Make Speculation Alarming; Midling Raised to 667 Yuan</h3>
<p>Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai are very active, because both the speculative "football" business and buyers are more active than the actual needs of factories. As a result, the prices of all goods have risen sharply. The price of American cotton Midling in the exchange has even reached a high of 650 yuan in June, which is incomparable with the calm cotton yarn market. As for factories that directly order American cotton or Brazilian cotton from foreign companies, their intention to purchase is also diligent. Yesterday, it was estimated that Chinese-owned yarn factories ordered 500-600 bales of Brazilian cotton, and other foreign-owned yarn factories also purchased about 1,000 bales. At the same time, all of these are fine-velvet raw materials that will arrive in Shanghai soon. The New York cotton market first fell due to long covering and selling at declining prices, then rose again due to some short covering and inter-dealer buying. As a result, the closing price was about 13-14 points higher than the previous day as reported.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to buying by European exporters, then fell due to selling by retail investors and profit-taking. Finally, the market rose again due to short covering and retail support. Yesterday's closing prices rose by about 5-6 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will fall by two and a half rupees.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton situation rose step by step, and fine-velvet raw materials were particularly scarce and expensive. The speed of its rush was like electricity, which made those with spot goods even more reluctant to sell. However, the rising trend in the yarn market has stopped, and the factories seem to be weakening in activity. The speculative "football" business is quite lively, and it does not seem to be affected by the recent arrival of a batch of goods, which has increased inventories.</p>
<h3>Large Investors Take Profits and Exit; Yarn Market Plunges</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned from high to low. This is because the degree of continuous rise in recent days has been considerable, causing large investors to take profits. At the same time, the sales of 20-count yarn were still narrow, and the demand for 32-count single yarn was also less than the previous day. The rising momentum of margins has been curbed, and the market has declined as a result. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,663 yuan, and the low price was 1,643 yuan. Noon transactions were extremely quiet. Although there were people at the meeting, the asking prices were different. The reason is that the establishment of the Yarn Industry Association Exchange has made transactions cumbersome, and people are unwilling to do more transactions. At the same time, the reaction against yarn prices fell by 12-13 yuan, and morale was even more dispersed. The initial price of Double Horse yarn was 1,647 yuan, which fell to 1,642-1,643 yuan. About 100-200 pieces were traded but not finalized. Today, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and 645 pieces were transported to other destinations.</p>
<p>Double Horse Morning Opening: Because the sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day was good and buying was still strong, the initial price was 1,656 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 1,654 yuan. Then, due to the tightening of margins and strong buying interest, it rose to 1,663 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain trader liquidated a large amount of profits, causing the market to loosen and fall back to 1,643 yuan. Some profit-takers covered short positions, and it rose again to 1,658 yuan. By the time the market closed, it was heard that the exchange price had fallen back, and market sentiment turned loose, closing at 1,644 yuan. The total volume traded in the half-day was 7,780 bales. The amounts bought by various trading groups are listed below: Hong Kong 280, other traders 7,500, totaling 7,780.</p>
<p>The Double Horse Futures market first rose and then fell, and the result was a decline. When the market opened in the morning, the news reported that foreign exchange had to be settled within a time limit, factory vehicles were becoming more expensive, and foreign exchange was shrinking. For a time, people were panicked, and most were inclined to buy. When the market opened in the morning, the August contract was at 1,493 yuan, and it rose rapidly to 1,500 yuan. Then, factory orders turned negative, and the gold market declined sharply. As a result, floating longs sold out their positions while making profits, and the market price declined. The September contract was quoted at 1,590 yuan, up 11 yuan, and the October contract was at 1,595 yuan, down 1 yuan. After entering the afternoon session, the market was weak, and the price continued to fall by 6-7 yuan. The noon close for the August contract was 1,489 yuan, unchanged. The September contract was 1,572 yuan, down 7 yuan. The October contract was 1,584 yuan, also down 2 yuan. The turnover of the spot market was 12,284. Afternoon trading turned weak. Large investors watched from the sidelines and did not take action. The market price fluctuated narrowly, only hovering between 2 and 8 yuan. Because the selling power was relatively strong, the price was slightly lower. As a result, the August contract closed at 1,483 yuan, down 6 yuan. The September contract was at 1,568 yuan, down 11 yuan. The October contract was at 1,584 yuan, down 12 yuan. The total daily turnover was approximately 16,130 bales, a decrease of 310 bales from the previous day. The daily price chart is listed below:</p>
<p>Market Notice: Trading of the August yarn contract will end on the 20th. The November contract will be added on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Food; Small-Grained Rice Used as a Speculative Tool; People Watching for Incidents in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Yesterday's transactions in the foreign rice market were mostly speculative, with the most being small-grained varieties. Because the outlets are wider, it has become a bargaining chip for speculation. Yesterday's market was still in this state, so at the opening of the morning market, speculators and retail investors, after seeing the report on the Far East policy issued by Britain and the United States, seemed to think that the prospects for the rice market were quite promising. Then they moved again, using small-grained rice as a bet, capturing and releasing each other. Therefore, under the impact of the crowds, the market price was suddenly excited. At that time, the opening price of small-grained rice at the bank warehouse was 120.5 yuan, and at the foreign warehouse it was 123.5 yuan. Later, as more rice was released, the price once fell slightly. The small-grained rice at the bank warehouse returned to 124 yuan, and at the foreign warehouse it was 123 yuan. After hovering for a while, unexpectedly the atmosphere rose again, and everyone absorbed it. The warning sounded, and the market felt even tighter. The closing price broke through the morning price, and small-grained rice even opened to 125 yuan at the bank warehouse and 124 yuan at the foreign warehouse, an increase of 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Other mid-range goods such as No. 2 Saigon and Siam also increased by 0.5 yuan to nearly 1 yuan. The opening price of No. 2 Saigon was 124.5 yuan, old rice was 126.5 yuan, and rice was 126 yuan. No. 2 Siam was 122.5 yuan to 119.5 yuan. As for high-quality goods such as No. 1 Saigon Siam, Mindang, and Jiafo, as well as broken rice, they have only been sold through actual sales outlets. Now, the street shops are still not smooth, so although the market is inevitably tight, the selling price has not changed much, which can still be called a fixed price. No. 1 Saigon opened at 135.2 yuan to 133.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam opened at 132 yuan to 130 yuan, Jiafo rice was 131-130 yuan, Mindang ordinary goods were 131 yuan, and broken rice was 95-91 yuan. However, as new indica rice from various inland areas will be available soon, and the Municipal Council is continuing to negotiate for Hong Kong rice small-grained varieties, there have been discussions on a fixed price of 144.95 yuan and an allocation price of 151.7 yuan. Yinghua Company small-grained rice ranged from 149 yuan to 150 yuan to 150.05 yuan, No. 2 mixed varieties ranged from 142.24 yuan, 143.58 yuan, and 144.2 yuan, with a maximum of 144.5 yuan. Transactions totaled more than 700 tons. There are now 14,500 bags of foreign rice arriving.</p>
<p>In the thick and thin japonica rice market, because the supply of glutinous rice is abundant, morale is low, and in a state of sluggish sales, the price continues to fall by 1-2 yuan. Fresh early and late rice from South Port opened at 151-152 yuan, Wuxi original package special japonica was 153 yuan, high-quality japonica was 150 yuan, and Zhongguan was 146-144 yuan. As for new japonica rice, a total of 16 stones arrived yesterday, and sales in stores are still behind, resulting in oversupply and a price decline of 1 yuan, opening at 155-156 yuan. Glutinous rice is still only some small-volume demand, so although the owners have little stock, the asking prices are all similar to before.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>In the current foreign flour market, the rising trend has intensified. This is because there are many Taiping factories, and speculators do not see good prospects. Although there is talk of importing large quantities of American flour, there are fears that the supply will not be sustained, so Japanese merchants are responding. Near noon, a large trader took in 10-20 thousand bags, so the prices of Jinlong flour and Paotai flour have risen to 33 yuan and 34 yuan respectively. Jinlong flour opened at 32.9 yuan to 33.1 yuan, Paotai flour opened at 34.1 yuan to 34.4 yuan, and Xiangjiao brand opened at 33.5 yuan, and Caishen brand opened at 34 yuan, all increasing by 4-5 jiao compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled about 30,000 bags, and the market is very active.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, there was a slight source of new wheat, with more than 300 bags brought from the suburbs, all of which were taken in by Japanese factory stores, priced at 41-42 yuan. On the Chinese side, there is still no considerable supply to be taken. Buying and selling in the market is imitating stagnation.</p>
<h3>Financial Market Fluctuates; Foreign Exchange Unstable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: The HSBC registered exchange rates did not change. The gray market for British and American exchange continued to tighten, and the trend was erratic. It opened tight in the morning, and in the double storm of speculators and importers, banks lacked the intention to supply, so August US dollars at 4.78125 were once difficult to trade. However, soon it was heard that HSBC's small amount of US exchange was still 4.8125, and the bank sold a huge amount at the above price. The storm had already subsided, but Huashang Bank suddenly started to sell, and Chinese merchants also turned to sell, and the trend suddenly hardened. US dollars at 4.875 were difficult to sell. British exchange was still stable. In the afternoon, silk exporters sold export bills of exchange, and British banks, HSBC, had profitable absorption.

<h3>Fluctuations in the Gold Market, Highly Variable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced a volatile trading session on both the official and black markets. Prices initially rose, then fell, breaking through the 7,200-yuan mark before retreating, and then fluctuated upwards again. Market participants were both apprehensive and hopeful. This was due to the foreign exchange market, which initially tightened, then stabilized, and finally softened. Building on the previous day's gains, buyers rushed in, pushing prices up to a high of 7,265 yuan. Later, rumors spread that HSBC was offering US dollars at 4.8125 yuan, and that other banks in China were also selling dollars, further easing the exchange rate. These rumors dispelled earlier anxieties. With sentiment stabilized, long positions were sold off. Under pressure from Xinyuan and securities firms, along with retail investors taking short positions, short sellers in the Shanghai West district became active, causing prices to plummet to 7,122 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market tightened again. With buying interest from Yida, Xiangxing, Yongxin, Fengyong, and Yonglitai, prices rose to 7,180 yuan. However, strong selling by Yiyuan forced prices back down, and the market closed with a gain of only two yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 150,000 to 160,000 taels.

Amidst the chaos, prices rose to 7,220 yuan. Defu and Tianyuan aggressively sold, dropping the price to 7,190 yuan. At that time, the supply of foreign exchange was low, making it difficult to settle even at 4.78125 yuan. Xinfeng, Yongxiang, Hede, Cheng, and retail investors aggressively bought, pushing prices up by more than 70 yuan to 7,265 yuan. Because HSBC was still offering US dollars at 4.8125 yuan, the market momentum was thwarted. Chengji, Yida, Dingsheng, Tianyuan, and Defu rushed to sell, causing a sharp decline of 120 yuan to 7,140 yuan. Then, with Yida, Shunyuan, and short covering, prices rebounded by 55 yuan, reaching 7,200 yuan.

The midday closing price was 7,132 yuan. After the close, prices rose to 7,145 yuan, then fell back to around 7,130 yuan.

With foreign exchange reports tightening, Xiangxing, Yong, Yida, Decheng, and retail investors aggressively bought, causing a sharp rise to 7,170 yuan. Yiyuan, Yifeng, Chengji, and Defu sold, pushing prices back to 7,135 yuan. Xiangxing and Yong then aggressively bought again. Yida, Xinfeng, Yonglitai, Tongkang, and Yongjun all absorbed supply, resulting in positive sentiment. Prices then rose to 7,180 yuan. Dachang, Yifeng, and retail investors sold, suppressing prices to a closing price of 7,152 yuan, only two yuan higher than the previous day's close. Calculated based on the September US dollar exchange rate of 4.8125 yuan, the settlement price was 7,236 yuan, a difference of 84 yuan. After the close, Xinyuan and Tongkang absorbed supply, raising the price to 7,165 yuan. There was a difference of 143 yuan that day.

<h3>Shanghai Celebrates the Anglo-American Declaration</h3>
<p>#### Chinese and Foreigners Alike Encouraged, Awaiting the Realization of True World Peace as China's Final Victory Becomes Increasingly Concrete</p>
<p>Since the meeting at sea between US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill and the subsequent issuance of the Anglo-American joint declaration, all Chinese and Westerners in this city have unanimously expressed their sincere support for the joint statement. Nationals from countries such as Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Norway, Yugoslavia, Free France, and Poland, whose territories have been lost due to the war, are even more interested. This is because, in the post-war world order, "all countries can live in peace within their borders" and "all countries that have been deprived by force can restore their sovereignty and autonomous government."</p>
<h3>Confidence Strengthens Among Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>Foreign nationals from these countries are increasingly confident, given that the new world order will surely be realized. In addition to vigorously mobilizing foreign residents in Shanghai to unite, they are also promoting various service movements, such as raising donations for the Red Cross, aviation funds, and dispatching volunteers to the front lines to fight to the death against the enemy.</p>
<h3>British and Americans Greatly Encouraged</h3>
<p>As for the British and American authorities in Shanghai, they are reluctant to comment much on this new development as the facts are clear. However, foreign nationals from both countries are silently praying that this historic declaration will guarantee the realization of true world peace, so that people can live and work in peace. British foreign national groups, such as the Royal Air Force Association, the Wartime Service Association, and the British Residents Association, have been greatly encouraged by this declaration.</p>
<h3>Chinese Unanimously Support It</h3>
<p>As for Soviet foreign nationals, they believe that the Anglo-American joint declaration demonstrates the determination of both countries to eliminate the Nazis and their enthusiasm for helping the Soviet Union. They are all overjoyed. On the Chinese side, close attention is being paid to this development. It is believed that the United Kingdom and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the Far East through this declaration, curb the spread of Nazi allies, and make the hope of China's final victory more concrete and certain.</p>
<h3>Laying a Rational Foundation for the World</h3>
<p>Mr. Morley of the British Information Office broadcasted on CDN radio last night on current events. He stated briefly that the secret and dramatic meeting at sea between Roosevelt and Churchill had been made clear due to the report of British Chief Secretary Attlee. The eight principles of the Roosevelt-Churchill joint statement not only confirmed the final victory, but also built a more perfect and reasonable foundation for the world in history. It is predicted that Hitler will inevitably attack from other places to obtain the rich oil fields of the Caucasus due to the failure of the invasion of the Soviet Union. The most likely places for Hitler to pass through are Turkey and Iran. However, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have jointly made firm guarantees to Turkey that if it is attacked, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will provide full assistance. This guarantee has been warmly welcomed by Ankara. Therefore, regardless of whether Hitler will make this desperate move, his failure is predetermined. Moreover, the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will make the camps of the world's two major blocs more obvious. The shameful peace rumors fabricated by the enemy have been defeated without being attacked.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Going to the Northeast Will Be Obstructed</h3>

<h3>New American Commercial Counselor Arrives in Shanghai, Determined to Maintain Trade</h3>
<p>#### Vowing to Overcome All Difficulties and Striving to Improve the Situation in Shanghai as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The newly appointed American Commercial Counselor to China, Mr. Grove, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 14th aboard the President Coolidge. He stated that he intends to take office immediately and will overcome difficulties to maintain American commerce. The commercial situation here is tied to the international political situation. Any restrictive measures are harmful to trade and normal commerce. Therefore, the freezing and retaliatory measures that have been implemented are bound to have an adverse impact on trade.</p>
<h3>The United States Aims to Protect Its Rights</h3>
<p>When asked about the US government's attitude towards the Far East, Mr. Grove expressed his belief that Washington would not obstruct trade unless absolutely necessary and would improve the situation here as much as possible. For example, even though a freezing order has been issued, licenses are still issued for legal American business, which is an example of this. The reason why the United States is implementing restrictions on the Far East is no different from the reason why it is implementing restrictions on Europe, namely, to protect American interests.</p>
<h3>Hoping to Maintain Ongoing Trade</h3>
<p>Mr. Grove also mentioned that American trade here has declined due to various restrictions and a lack of ships. He stated that American businessmen should maintain ongoing trade. Even if the amount is reduced, it is better than letting it stop completely. According to Mr. Grove, he has been working for the US government since 1919, serving in commercial positions in Europe, including France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and the Balkan countries. However, this is his first time in the Far East. Also, the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the new American Commercial Counselor to China, Mr. Grove, said that American trade with China may be reduced if necessary, but it must be maintained so that it does not stop abruptly. He believes that Washington will do its best to maintain and improve the situation in Shanghai.</p>

All banks engaged in foreign exchange have now complied with the order and have each found ways to settle their outstanding foreign exchange transactions before July 26 (including August and September futures transactions). The total amount to be entrusted to the Central Bank to handle the redemption in New York, USA, is 1.5 million US dollars, all transferred into the Central Bank's account.

<h3>No News from Huaian</h3>
<p>According to unconfirmed reports received by personnel from the Shanghai American Presbyterian Church, the female missionary belonged to the Presbyterian Church and was strangled to death about a week ago, but this information has not been confirmed because the church in Shanghai cannot communicate with Huaian.

<p>#### It is Rumored That It Will Be Passed Based on the Original Plan and a Final Decision Will Be Made on September 3</p>
<p>In order to make up for the budget shortfall for this year, the Municipal Council plans to levy a special business tax. On the 24th of last month, the Tax System Committee submitted a report to the Municipal Council meeting. After discussion, it was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Committee for review. Because the Municipal Council meeting was on vacation during the summer, the first meeting after the summer vacation will be held on September 3, so the Finance Committee did not immediately convene a meeting. However, the financial situation of the Municipal Council is becoming more and more difficult, and it is believed that it is necessary to submit it for review immediately. Therefore, it was decided to convene a meeting in the Municipal Council conference room at 4:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month to conduct a detailed review of the case. It is rumored that the original plan will be passed based on the report of the Tax System Committee, and then submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for discussion and a final decision.

The defendant was unwilling to accept this and instigated Japanese people such as Toshio Eguchi to come forward and gather people to Zhou's law office, intending to abduct him to Hongkou to handle the matter. The police stated that this was a legal issue and advised the Japanese not to arbitrarily arrest people. However, the Japanese insisted that they must take Zhou Lawyer to Hongkou.

At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Ji emerged from the Citibank building, west of the Central Police Station on Foochow Road. Ji was wearing a light grey suit and white leather shoes. As he walked across from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, intending to board his personal car, license number 6681, two thugs lying in wait there. One of them pulled out a pistol and fired one shot at Ji, hitting him in the mouth, passing through the back of his head, immediately causing blood to gush out. He fell to the ground and died instantly. Seeing their objective achieved, the assailants jumped into a car, license number 3475, parked nearby, and sped west along Foochow Road to escape. The Central Police Station, located nearby, received the report and immediately dispatched detectives to pursue them, firing shots at the car. The thugs in the car also frequently fired back, resisting arrest. This led to a rare major gunfight in the Central District. The sound of gunfire on Foochow Road was dense, bullets flying like rain. Police officers at various intersections also joined the pursuit, with intense gunfire and blaring sirens. The car fled to the intersection of Foochow Road and Fujian Road, where it was blocked by police officers facing them. Realizing the situation was dire, the thugs exited the car and fled, while continuing to shoot. They struck Chinese police officer number 1199 in the chest, who fell to the ground, dying in the line of duty in front of the Tongxing Restaurant. The two thugs fled to the Hubei Road intersection, where they shot Chinese police officer number 880 in the right knee, causing him to collapse in front of the Qinglian Pavilion. Detectives were still pursuing closely behind. As a result, one thug, wearing a grey-colored Paletot suit, was shot several times at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Nanjing Road, near the Maochang Optical Company, and was captured. He was identified as Tang Chunshan (22 years old), who died soon after due to his injuries. The other thug was surrounded and arrested at the Hubei Road intersection and has confessed to participating in the assassination.</p>
<p>Nine Bystanders, Male and Female, Injured</p>
<p>After the incident, the police immediately cordoned off the Foochow Road area and conducted a thorough search. It was reported that two more suspects were apprehended and taken in for questioning. As the thugs resisted arrest along the way, bullets flew in all directions. Stray bullets hit nine pedestrians, including: (1) Sun Yunsheng (30 years old), (2) Chen Jinan (31 years old), (3) Jiang Xiasong (29 years old), all injured in the buttocks; (4) Li Yousong (21 years old), injured in the thigh; (5) Chen Guanghui (32 years old), grazed in the chest; (6) Zhuang Da (31 years old), injured in the right foot; (7) Wang Xuechun (31 years old), injured in the thigh; (8) Chen Wangshi (38 years old), and (9) Zhang Maoshi (17 years old), both injured in the feet. They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The bodies of Ji Kunsheng and the Chinese police officer were sent to the coroner's office, while the injured police officer was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital. At the same time, the large glass windows of the Zhonghua Book Company and Wuzhou Pharmacy were also damaged by gunfire. There were also rumors that there were about a dozen thugs, traveling in two cars, lying in wait on Foochow Road, beside the Central Police Station. Some escaped in another car, while the others tried to escape in car number 3475, but were intercepted by detectives. The license plate number 3475 was registered to a foreign doctor, suggesting it was forged by the assailants. It was also rumored that the car was stolen from a Chinese person in front of the Paramount Ballroom a few days ago.</p>
<p>Young, Handsome, and Successful</p>
<p>Ji was born in Chongqing on November 16, 1913. His father, Ji Zhishou, is 64 years old and currently in Chongqing, serving as the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance and the General Manager of He Cheng Bank. Ji himself graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai in 1936 and then engaged in business in Shanghai. He first worked at the American Asiatic Underwriters and later served as the Shanghai Manager of He Cheng Bank, which specialized in domestic remittances and had a thriving business. At the same time, he founded the Kejing Company, specializing in the export of lace. In his spare time, he would write articles and publish them in English financial and commercial weekly journals. Ji was young, handsome, and amiable in his dealings with people, and had never participated in any political activities. This sudden assassination is unclear. It is said that Ji had recently received threatening letters, so he moved to the American Club for safety, but unfortunately, he was still assassinated. Those who heard of this were filled with sorrow. His body has been examined and sent to the International Funeral Parlor. The funeral is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Two Baskets of Gifts Delivered, Two Hand Grenades Discovered: Threats to Wu Bosheng, Manager of a Cotton Mill, Who Previously Received Two Threatening Letters</h3>
<p>Wu Bosheng, a native of Anhui, is 58 years old and resides at No. 80, Lane 201 (Wanyi Lane), Luban Road in the French Concession. He is currently the factory manager of the British-owned Xinhe Cotton Mill at 26 Moganshan Road in West Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, a middle-aged man wearing a worker's uniform suddenly arrived, carrying two bamboo baskets filled with bananas and apples, claiming they were gifts for Mr. Wu. The maid brought the two baskets to the mistress of the house and asked the man to wait in front of the door. Later, the mistress accepted the gifts and gave the maid a few dollars to give to the man, but when the maid went outside, the man had disappeared. The mistress was very surprised and examined the two baskets of gifts. She discovered that the top basket contained bananas, while the bottom basket contained two wooden-handled hand grenades, she was terrified and immediately reported to the police. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and took the two hand grenades to the police station for investigation. It is said that Wu Bosheng had received two threatening letters three days ago, demanding a loan of several tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<h3>Seven Orphaned Children Apply for Scholarships, Describing Their Family Experiences; Childlike Innocence and Genuine Emotions Revealed, Determined to Learn and Not Discouraged</h3>
<p>The seven orphaned children graduating from the Youjiao Nursery have all been admitted to Suzhou Middle School this semester. Through the introduction of the nursery, they applied to the newspaper for the "Readers' Scholarship Fund." The day before yesterday afternoon, they came to the office in an organized group to describe their family backgrounds and experiences. They are all wanderers from the atmosphere of war, some lost their fathers, some lost their mothers, and one is an orphan with both parents deceased. Although this is the case, they are not discouraged and are all determined to learn. Below are the written statements from each of them.</p>
<p>Ou Debiao</p>
<p>Before August 13th, I lived at a certain address in Lai'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. When the war broke out, the house was occupied, and my father, mother, siblings, and I escaped to the New World Shelter. After living there for more than a year, the New World was reclaiming the property, so we moved to the Guangci First Shelter on Wenyi Road. Unfortunately, my parents contracted typhoid fever and said goodbye to me forever in the hospital! I had to rely on my sister to survive. Fortunately, the director of the shelter introduced me to the Gonghua Shelter, where I lived for a year, before the Gonghua Shelter was reorganized into the Youjiao Nursery until now. I have already graduated from the nursery. Recently, I heard that your newspaper is launching the "Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund," and we are really happy. The teachers at the nursery took us to Suzhou Middle School to register for the entrance exam, which was an unexpected joy. Later, we were admitted, and the teachers told us to immediately fill out the forms and send them to your newspaper, hoping that your newspaper will do its best to help us so that we will not be at risk of dropping out of school. I will study hard so as not to let down the kindness and support of the gentlemen of your newspaper and philanthropists from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Lu Jialiang</p>
<p>Before August 13th, I was in the countryside of Baoshan County. After the war broke out, I escaped from the countryside and wandered into the concession for a day. Later, relatives introduced us to the Cishi Shelter, where we lived for more than a year. My parents went home to see the hometown, but it was burned down, with only a pile of rubble left. My parents returned to Shanghai and took me back to the countryside to live with relatives. We had a place to live, but what about food? My father was very sad and went to work, but a day's wages were only one yuan, which was not enough to live on. Our relatives in Shanghai found out and wrote to introduce me to the Gonghua Shelter, where I lived for a year before it was reorganized into the Youjiao Nursery. I was in the first semester of sixth grade. At this time, unfortunately, my father died, and my mother lived alone at home. Now that I have graduated from sixth grade, I cannot afford to continue my education, so I am asking for assistance.</p>
<p>Huang Rongsheng</p>
<p>I lived at a certain address in Shouyuan Lane, Xietu Road, Luban Road in the Nanshi, with my parents and younger brother. My father was a carpenter. I studied at a nearby primary school for free. My younger brother did not go to school. When I was ten years old, my mother passed away, and I was very sad. My younger brother cried every day. But later, the war broke out, and my father, my younger brother, and I fled to the concession. In the evening, the Renji Hall card sent us to the Huicheng Shelter. Later, an acquaintance sent me to the Gonghua Shelter. After a few years, the Gonghua Shelter was reorganized into the current Youjiao Nursery.</p>
<p>Gao Zhongde</p>
<p>My father worked at the Commercial Press but lost his job during the war. Our family of eight fled to the Fuxing Shelter on Foochow Road. A year later, the Fuxing Shelter was disbanded, and we entered the Ciyuan Shelter. At this time, my mother asked a friend to introduce me to the Youjiao Nursery. On November 21st of the 29th year of the Republic, my mother said goodbye to us forever. The year my mother passed away, I was already fifteen years old. My older brother is a hawker, and my younger brother is studying at Ciyuan. Now that I have graduated from primary school at the Youjiao Nursery, I am specially applying to your newspaper for a scholarship so that I can continue my studies.</p>
<p>Zhang Chaolun</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai War, my family lived in the countryside near Shanghai. When I was nine years old, my mother died. My father worked in Shanghai, and the family's finances were considered wealthy. When the war broke out, our family of four fled to the concession. My father lost his job, so it was difficult to maintain our livelihood. Fortunately, an acquaintance introduced us to the International Relief Committee's Sixth Refugee Shelter, which provided food and lodging, and valuable opportunities to study. Later, due to economic reasons, the shelter was disbanded. I was sent to the Youjiao Nursery Gonghua Shelter to continue my studies. Now that I have graduated from primary school, I still want to continue my studies, but I cannot afford the tuition. Seeing that your newspaper is launching a scholarship fund specifically to benefit underprivileged children, I could not have dreamed of it.</p>
<p>Yan Houzhang</p>
<p>Before the war broke out, my family lived at Dongjiadu in the Nanshi, a family of five. I was studying at Dongjiadu Catholic Church Zhengxiu First Primary School. After the war broke out, we fled to my hometown of Wuxing County. After two years, we fled back to Shanghai. At that time, my father had already lost his job. Through a relative's introduction, he went to the Bund to work as a clerk, earning only 20 yuan a month, barely making ends meet. Through an introduction, I went to the Youjiao Nursery to study. In the blink of an eye, I have already graduated from primary school. Later, the Shen Bao published information about the scholarship fund. Our class teacher told me to take the entrance exam for Suzhou Middle School, as well as Xinbei Middle School and others. Fortunately, I was admitted. Because the Shen Bao is paying for our tuition and miscellaneous fees, this is such a happy thing! I am truly grateful!</p>
<p>Hu Jisheng</p>
<p>After my hometown was occupied, I fled to Shanghai to my uncle's house. Because my uncle's family had many people, the monthly expenses were not enough, so I could not stay for long. Therefore, I asked my uncle to find a school for refugee relief. As a result, he sent me to the Youjiao Nursery. I was very happy that the nursery had books to read and food to eat. It was just like a home. I studied for two years and graduated, but I felt that my knowledge and skills were not enough, so I was very sad. Now your newspaper is able to help poor students! This is very rare, so I am applying for a scholarship; I hope to acquire rich knowledge.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Teachers Come to Shanghai to Appeal; Ningbo Fellow Association Provides Relief</h3>
<p>Since Ningbo was occupied, the elementary schools in the counties of Ningbo have been closed one after another, and the original teachers of each school have suddenly become unemployed.

<h3>Praying for Rain Parade</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>According to a friend who just arrived in Shanghai, a certain place has been suffering from drought for six months. The land is cracked, and the farmers are suffering. The county magistrate, to show compassion for the people's suffering, initiated a parade to pray for rain and forced all the students in the elementary schools to participate. The result is unknown.</p>
<p>In ancient times, our ancestors regarded natural phenomena such as wind, rain, thunder, and lightning as incomprehensible mysteries, believing them to be manifestations of the anger and power of the gods. This was understandable in an ignorant and unenlightened ancient society. However, in the scientifically advanced 20th century, we have long understood that these are natural phenomena that have nothing to do with gods. In the Soviet Union, scientists are experimenting with artificial rain, and it is said that they have already achieved considerable success. It is expected that in the near future, humans will be able to control the wind and rain, which will not be a strange thing.</p>
<p>However, it is pitiful that in our China, the thinking of some people is not much different from that of people in primitive times. We still believe that rain can be obtained by praying for it, that drought is the will of Heaven, and perhaps some people still believe that it is the punishment of the gods.</p>
<p>Schools should be educational institutions that disseminate scientific knowledge, and school children are the backbone of the future society. However, in our China, they have to abandon scientific knowledge to participate in parades to pray for rain. This is such a pitiful and ridiculous thing.</p>
<p>In terms of science and thought, we are too far behind others. We must catch up quickly.</p>

<h3>Mosquito Swarms in the Frigid Zone</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiajun</p>
<p>Most people think that the hottest climates have the most mosquitoes and the most intense harm. However, this is incorrect. The northern parts of Asia, Europe and America are teeming with swarms of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>During the Soviet-Finnish War, after the German-Finnish forces launched an offensive in northern Europe, the slowness of their advance was an undeniable fact. While this was certainly due to the Soviet Union's valiant resistance, the mosquitoes lurking in the forests and swamps also played a role. When the German soldiers were fighting or sleeping soundly, they immediately launched "air raids," desperately sucking the blood of the Germanic people with their sharp mouths, and then triumphantly flying back to their original defenses. These "airplanes" made the Nazi army feel even more afraid than the British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft, because even the best anti-aircraft guns made by the Krupp arms factory could not deal with them.</p>
<p>In northern Canada, an American expedition discovered that the mosquitoes there were indeed much larger. Slapping one's palm on the table was sure to kill over a hundred mosquitoes, sometimes turning the hand completely red. On average, there were thirty mosquitoes per six square inches on the mosquito nets, so each net contained as many as fourteen thousand mosquitoes. Several explorers found that if they put their hands in the air for five minutes, fifty or sixty mosquitoes would land on them.</p>
<p>In several places in Outer Mongolia, when travelers or caravans had to travel long distances, they would choose to spend the night on dry highlands every night. Mosquitoes are also quite numerous here. After sunset, countless blood-sucking demons fly out of the salt lakes. Therefore, if there are livestock, special care must be taken. Otherwise, in the silent night, one can hear the sheep running around and wailing as they flee from the mosquito swarms, or the next morning, one can see horses with blood-soaked skin rubbing frantically against the wheels because of the itching.</p>
<p>In the forests of Manchuria, a white tent cloth can be covered with mosquitoes and turn black. If one shakes an insect net in the air for a while, one can catch pounds of mosquitoes, and all their blood collected together is estimated to be more than a pint. Therefore, one must wear veils and gloves when walking in the woods. If the skin is exposed, hundreds of mosquitoes will rush to suck blood, and it will take two or three weeks for the wound to return to its original state.</p>
<p>Historical Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Qin Hua Li</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>— Ai Zi's New Interpretation, Part 2</p>
<p>Ai Zi told a story one day.</p>
<p>During the era of the Three Sovereigns, there was a man named Tian Ba who lived in Jixia and claimed to be the best at handling matters, able to resolve any major problem. Everyone admired him immensely.</p>
<p>Tian Ba had a disciple named Qin Hua Li, who had learned many of his teacher's insightful and brilliant theories.</p>
<p>One day, Qin Hua Li was strutting proudly down the street when he was stopped by an old woman.</p>
<p>"Disciple of Tian Ba, this old woman has a question to ask," the old woman said.</p>
<p>"Ask away, I, Qin Hua Li, have never encountered a problem that I cannot solve."</p>
<p>The old woman said, "The horse's mane points upward and is short, while the horse's tail points downward and is long. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, ha ha!" the logic expert laughed, "That's very easy. The horse's mane points upward to show stubbornness, so Heaven punishes it by making it short. The horse's tail points downward to show humility, so Heaven rewards it by making it long."</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Qin, hair grows upward defiantly, so why is it long? The beard droops downward humbly, so why is it short?"</p>
<p>"This ah..." Qin Hua Li's logic hit a wall. Helpless, he said, "Let me go ask my teacher. Please wait here, and I will give you a thousand cowrie shells as a reward."</p>
<p>Mr. Qin, dripping with sweat, arrived at Tian Ba's house, breathlessly reporting everything, how he had resolved the horse's hair with the logic of defiance and obedience, but could not resolve human hair, and finally added:</p>
<p>"Teacher, that damned old woman is still waiting outside for our reward!"</p>
<p>Tian Ba thought for a full hour but could not find a way to answer. He led his disciple out the back door, thinking, "Fortunately, it's a small matter. What if it were a major national affair?"</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Serenade at Midnight</p>
<p>As he spoke, he opened a small door and tried to step out.</p>
<p>"It's getting late, aren't you going to sleep yet?" Qiu Haitang asked, looking at his back.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter whether I sleep or not." Yu Kun's body was already outside the door. "Your daughter has returned tonight. I can no longer sleep in the same room with you. Tell Xiaogouzi to spread a few bundles of wheat stalks on the ground for me. You don't have to ask me when I'm coming back!"</p>
<p>His voice faded as he spoke, and Qiu Haitang could barely hear half of the last sentence.</p>
<p>Since Yu Kun decided to come to Zhangshupu, he had not wanted to mention Luo Xiangqi to Qiu Haitang, but as soon as Mei Shi saw him, she couldn't help but think of what happened three years ago when he came here to persuade her father to go to Beiping to meet her mother.</p>
<p>Because she had such a heavy matter in her mind, she had been unable to sleep well after getting into bed, but when Qiu Haitang asked her many questions about school, she gave irrelevant answers. Qiu Haitang thought that she was too tired and wanted to sleep, so she couldn't bear to ask her any more questions and tried to calm down and quietly fall asleep.</p>
<p>As a result, the older one fell asleep first, while the younger one continued to toss and turn in bed.</p>
<p>"I wonder where Mom is now?" She closed her eyes and thought deeply. "Uncle Zhao should know. I must inquire about it from him tomorrow, and even if Dad doesn't let me go see her immediately, as long as school starts, I can at least write to her... (186)</p>
<h3>Dog Wears Dentures</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>The progress and development of dentistry in recent years has undoubtedly benefited mankind. Not only can patients suffering from dental diseases no longer suffer unnecessary pain, but also elderly people who have lost their teeth can enjoy the pleasure of chewing again. Recently, a dental technician in Chicago, USA, kept a dog that had lost many of its teeth. The technician felt sorry for it and fitted it with a set of dentures so that his beloved dog could still show its terrifying white teeth when barking madly and would not experience the inconvenience of being toothless when eating.</p>
<p>How many people do not engage in such "brilliant arguments" now, even when it comes to major national affairs?</p>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>— Canaan</p>
<p>Money is the most useless thing in the world. - Henry Ford</p>
<p>All great misers are pessimistic. - Helen Woodward</p>
<p>Money is not the secret to leadership. - G.B. Shaw Fame is more valuable than money, wealth, or anything else. Money cannot buy it. - J.P. Morgan</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles</h3>
<p>— Xiaoxian</p>
<p>(1) The Tongtian Sect Leader Has Many Students (Part 2)</p>
<p>Xue Yanqin, Mao Jianpei, Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, Xin Yanqiu, Zhang Eyuan, Ma Yanyun, Hu Bilan, Zhao Xiuyun. Zhu Chaohua, Wang Yurong, Zhang Yunyan, Deng Deqin, Zhao Jinrong, Feng Yufu, Wang Yulan, Jin Hemei, Hou Yulan. Bai Yuwei, Zhang Guanzhu, Yan Yueqiu, Yang Yanxia, Zhang Meiyun, (the above are female) more than fifty people. In addition, there are many amateur performers not listed. However, in reality, not all of the above fifty people can be considered Yaoqing's disciples. Mei Lanfang, Wang Huifang, and Jiang Miaoxiang were all students of Chen Shoutou Delin. Yaoqing was one of Chen's six major disciples (the so-called six major disciples are Wang Yaoqing, Wang Huifang, Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Wang Qinnong, and Yao Yufu. Lanfang, Huifang, and Miaoxiang are indeed fellow disciples. As for Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, and Xiao Cuihua, they all came from opera schools. Cheng Yanqiu was a student of Rong Diexian, making him Yaoqing's grand-disciple. These people may have sought advice from Yaoqing later and registered as students, but they cannot be called Wang's inner disciples. Now, when Yaoqing talks about his numerous students, he always includes the Four Great Dan, which is inevitably exaggerated. As for Yaoqing's most successful disciples, regardless of female roles, among the male actors, Zhao Tongshen (Furong Cao) and Cheng Yuqing are the most prominent. Tongshen has been in the South for a long time, but Yuqing is the closest to Yaoqing. Yaoqing treats Yuqing with great care, better than his peers. Yaoqing's unique masterpieces "Fiery Flag" and "Loyal Mandarin Ducks" are only taught to Yuqing alone. Yaoqing once told people, "Yuqing can do everything that I can do." Yaoqing's favor towards Yuqing is evident. Yuqing, in Wang's school, became arrogant because of his teacher's favor. His fellow disciples respectfully called him "Senior Brother." Generally, female actors are very respectful to this Senior Brother because Yuqing often spoke about the plays on behalf of the teacher. Even virtuous ones like Zhang Eyuan and Xin Yanqiu were no exception. Therefore, although Wang's students are numerous, Cheng Yuqing is the only one who is influential in Gu Mao Xuan.</p>
<h3>"Real Sound" Popularization Event</h3>
<p>— Boyi</p>
<p>For those friends who consider the Real Sound's anniversary concert a rare and excellent performance, here is very good news. The Real Sound Music Society has decided to hold a popularization event at the Russian Art Theatre on Fuxu Road the day after tomorrow, August 18th. The time is still 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Among non-"music experts," it has always been difficult to accept this type of choral performance. We all have a negative impression of church-style choirs, leading to a prejudice that choral music is a collaborative effort with superfluous voices and wasted manpower.</p>
<p>However, the members of Real Sound have their own "persuasion tactics." I met two who explained it to me as follows: if I can understand the words, then I can understand their choral music.</p>
<p>There are two ways to interpret this statement: one is that the performance makes it easy to understand, and the other is that one only needs to listen to the lyrics. I went to listen, and I immediately understood their words.</p>
<p>We love Real Sound's choral music precisely because it sings about everything that needs to be sung. "From Border to Border" can serve as a war song to protect our national security, "Universal Lament" expresses the anger for our martyred heroes, and "Prisoner's Song" and "Escape" are direct accusations.</p>
<p>Life determines taste. I dare not say that everyone can appreciate the works introduced by Real Sound, but I dare to recommend to the sons and daughters of the motherland who refuse to bow their heads to dreams: this concert will not disappoint you.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan Enters Primary School in Fine Clothes</p>
<p>The lyricist listened to Yuan Yuan's words with doubt, saying: "Your plan is good, but how can I leave with you? Won't your family accuse me of enticing you to run away? And if they tell them, how would your stepmother allow you to leave with me? Besides, my family wouldn't allow me to do this." Yuan Yuan sighed: "You are too timid! It is not easy for me to be willing to go with you! In ancient times, Hong Fu Nu eloped with Li Jing, wasn't it the same? If you are afraid of being implicated, we can hide for a while, and then show our faces after they go back. As long as we leave a secret message before we leave, we won't be guilty. They'll just think that you and I went to Hangzhou to burn incense, and they can't say anything bad, and we can make excuses in front of Tian Hongyu. After you go back today, bring some clothes, utensils, and books, hire a small boat, and come to my place tomorrow at noon. Have the boat wait quietly at the north of the bridge. Tonight, I will take care of some valuables and go with you. To tell you the truth, over the past few years, I have secretly saved a lot of money, so please don't worry. Until tomorrow night, we can leave through the back door with our families behind our backs, which they won't expect. Do you think this is a good idea?" The lyricist saw that she was both bold and intelligent, and couldn't help but nod and say: "This plan is great, I will definitely go with you. You are willing to do this as a woman, how can I refuse? It's a pity that although you are a second Hong Fu, I am ashamed that I can't learn to be Li Jing." Yuan Yuan smiled slightly: "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Those who try can be like this! Haven't you read these few sentences? Those who have the will shall achieve their goals, and as long as you can be determined, what can't be done?" The lyricist was encouraged by her words and turned his sorrow into joy. Looking around and seeing that there was no one else, he couldn't help but embrace Yuan Yuan's waist and gently kissed her cheek. Yuan Yuan gave him a reproachful look, but just as she was about to speak, a little maid rushed upstairs and said: "Lord Tian is here!" (143)</p>
<h3>Special Mini-Chronicles of Pear Garden People</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guo Yi Writes the Biography, Zhang Yizhang Creates the Drawings</p>
<p>(31) Li Shifang</p>
<p>Li Shifang is the so-called "Little Mei Lanfang" among the current Four Little Famous Dan. When Shifang performed in the opera school, Lanfang happened to return from Shanghai. Someone introduced him to join Mei's school, but Lanfang decided to stay in Beijing for a very short time. Although Shifang once observed the disciple's ceremony, he may not have obtained Lanfang's legacy and suddenly become a legitimate talent. However, I see that the photos of him in opera costumes are elegant and beautiful, and the expression in his eyes resembles Lanfang, which is the reason for his nickname, "Little Mei Lanfang". I have not visited the old capital for ten years, and I have not seen Shifang's plays. Based on the electricity, his Qingyi is better than Song Dezhu and Mao Shilai, who have no foundation, but I don't know how he compares to another of the Four Little Famous Dan, Zhang Junqiu.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Drama Notes</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>Huang Jin invited Cheng Yanqiu to Shanghai in early August of the lunar calendar. He will be performing in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Yanqiu has a new play, "Daughter's Heart," which will be performed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Opera Association welcomed comrades Yu Zongying, He Yuru, and Wang Ruilin, who returned from Xiamen, at the temporary office of Hexingfang on Danshui Road, expressing gratitude for the 3,000 yuan in donations they brought.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yu Zongying visited his teacher Zhou Xinfang to report on his performance in Xiamen. He has been invited by the stage manager to rejoin the troupe.</p>
<p>Hu Xudong's Peking Opera "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" has been completed, but Zhang Yipeng is not preparing to perform it in the short term due to problems such as scenery and costumes.</p>
<p>After leaving the Datage, Kunling Zhang Shuxian originally planned to return to Tianjin, but she did not go with Liang Yiming. According to her, although she will stay in Shanghai for a few more days, there are no other developments.</p>
<h3>Film World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Zhang Fukang is willing to pay a price of three thousand coins to invite Han Langen to come to the South and star in a film. This amount is quite expensive. Yesterday, reporters met Han and asked him about the situation. He said: "Although money is good, feelings are also important. My relationship with Guolian's boss Zhang is harmonious, so I cannot leave."</p>
<p>The Jin Xing Film Company established a film and drama training class half a year ago. The students have achieved excellent results, especially Ding Ciming and Cheng Lingzhi, who have the most promising futures. The Jin Xing authorities have scheduled a graduation ceremony for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM at Raffay, and will also stage a drama.</p>
<p>The American Victory Record Company will be making large-scale regular recordings starting in the fall, and has recently publicly solicited new singers and song works. The contact address is the Music Department of the company in the Guohua Building on Beijing Road.</p>
