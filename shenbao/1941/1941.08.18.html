<p>國際社十七日倫敦電　星期畫報今日載一未證實之消息稱、英首相邱吉爾或將會晤斯達林舉行會議、一如其與羅期福總統在海上舉行談話然、「雷諾斯日報」力稱、衆料蔣介石將軍不久即將啓程赴莫斯科、與紅軍諸領袖討論遠東局勢、足示中蘇兩國有簽訂針對日本之互助公的可能云、</p>
<p>塔斯社十七日莫期斯科電　十五日英美兩國駐蘇大使晋謁斯達林、以羅斯福總統及邱吉爾首相聯合電文呈交期氏、關於英美準備助蘇向德作戰一點、期氏已代表蘇聯政府請求英美大使代向羅總統及邱首相表示謝意、至於羅邱兩氏建議在莫期科召開會議以便討論原料及軍火分配一節、斯建林亦表示歡迎、斯達林並謂渠將採取各項步驟、務使三强會議可儘早舉行、斯達林接見英美大使時、莫洛托夫亦在座、</p>

<p>國際社十七日華盛頓電　此間外交界預測、行將在莫斯科舉行之英美蘇三强會議、有三重目的、（一）英美欲努力使蘇加入民治國新秩序、（二）英美欲察知蘇軍對德作戰在戰略上之地位、並使斯達林知悉、英軍事顧問有協助蘇參謀部之可能、（三）英美欲獲得保證、無論西綫發展如何、蘇遠東軍常駐西伯利亞以牽制日本、衆信斯達林對良好世界秩序合作程度將視英美在此次戰事中援蘇程度而定、同時聞華府倫敦亟欲知悉西綫蘇軍之眞正地位、</p>

<p>合衆社十七日梅恩州洛克蘭電　羅斯福總統昨日稱、渠與英首相邱吉爾最近在歷史性之海上會議中起草戰後和平目標之程序時、對於世界上各大洲之局勢、成立英美之充分諒解、羅總統稱、美國並不較以前更接近參戰、渠係於昨日由「波多瑪克」游艇登岸後所舉行之新聞招待會中發言、羅斯福總統宜稱、渠目前所計劃、係假定蘇聯於明年春季尚與納粹作戰、渠謂蘇聯並未被邀在英美宣言中之八原則中參預意見、並謂渠對於任何邀請蘇聯參加之計劉、並無所知、渠稱、蘇聯之需要包括二類、第一爲立可獲得之原料、以援助夏季之戰事、第二種需要係以假設冬季戰事半陷停頓爲根據、此種需要包括明年春季戰事可以獲得之原料、羅總統稱、渠與邱吉衞首相晤談時、英美同等官銜之官員則各舉行多次會議、渠拒絕披露會議之地點、與會議時間之久暫、謂守此秘密理由甚明、羅總統指稱、第一項積極之發展、爲請求國會擬出數千兆之新預算、以補充原有之七十萬萬租借費、渠謂此種在國會中之請求頃在研究中、羅總統稱、英美之諒解對於世界局面之各點均屬完備係暗示美國與英國已於協定中聯合一致、俾便兩國於應付任何事變時得以順利行事、總統謂渠與邱吉爾首相在前亞洲艦隊旗艦「奧格斯脫」號及英戰艦「威爾斯親王」號上舉行會議時、對各大洲均嘗加以討論、渠謂在「奧格斯脫」號艦上僅舉行會議一次、某記者詢以「君認吾人已更爲接近參戰吾」、羅總統立予答覆稱、渠殊不認爲美國已接近實際之參戰、渠拒絕准許新聞記者直接引用上述之答語、羅總統稱、渠與邱吉爾首相意見之交換、多係涉及當前及未來、渠顯明表示渠之與英首相草擬聯合之行動、以對付世界上任何部分所發生之事件、惟渠並無絲毫之表示謂美國之合作將較前此更爲直接、即作爲民主國家之軍火廠是也、以言法國政局、謂渠因消息缺如之故、未能洞悉其內幕、一俟返抵華府之後、即當與赫爾國務卿討論此事、同時並當就遠東局勢最近之發展、與國務卿有所會商、渠前嘗宣佈渠希望與坎特公爵於下星期在海德公園晤談、羅斯福總統表達英國及邱吉爾氏不恤任何代價擊敗納粹政權之決心、渠謂計論家多已忽略納粹侵入更多國家之際、英美兩國交換關於世界局勢之意見之需要、渠宣稱、此項問題愈加探討、則納粹染指更多國家之思想愈見可怕、羅總統稱、各民主國家對此問題、應出以最愼重之探肘、羅總統宣稱、赴會一行包括陸軍總參謀馬歇爾將軍陸軍之空軍部長安諾爾少將·海軍參謀長史達克上將·大西洋艦隊總司令金少將·國務副卿威爾斯·哈里曼氏·及總統之私人隨員等、羅斯福總統宣稱、蘇聯非在租借程序之下獲得援助、因蘇聯擁有償付戰爭原料之現款也、總統於午後四時離開游艇乘專卓赴華盛頓、</p>
<p>會議動機　路透社十七日洛克蘭電羅斯福總統稱、渠與英相會議之動機、始於本年二月、目係共同計畫、嗣因希臘與克里地之戰事、致使會議日期延緩三月、渠以爲聯合宜言中與宣言批評中、皆忽視一事、其事維何、即對於納粹治權下各處情形互換意見之必要是、淪陷區或納粹勢力區中之情形、愈加硏究則愈覺境內有此勢力之可怖、</p>
<p>艦上祈禱　總統言及八月十日邱吉國在「威爾斯親王」號戰艦上舉行祈禱事、謂參加叶次禮拜者、咸感覺此爲有歷史性之重要祈禱、主持祈禱儀式者爲英美敎士各一人云、</p>
<p>英相行踪　又謂渠與邱吉爾會商不止一日、在目前與將來情報互換上甚著功效、至於邱吉爾之行踪、則總統拒不宣布、僅謂以渠所知、英相不擬來游美國、而渠本人亦不擬此時往游英國云、羅斯福總統在招待新聞記者時精神健旺、態度從容、口含烟捲、對趨入招待室之各記者含笑爲禮、招待旣畢、總統登岸、觀衆歡聲雷動、旋赴車站乘專車向華府出發、由江干至車站之各街皆懸旗歡迎、觀者如堵、白宮警備隊長斯塔林上校率秘密警探多人於游艇駛抵前、即已　洛克蘭從事戒備、地方軍警亦在總統所經過之途中担任保衛工作、</p>

<h3>美日關係前途　視日行動而定</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日華盛頓電「史格外嗡斯霍華特」、京報紙評論家丹尼昨稱、由於納粹在蘇境前進及美國援蘇物品抵遠西伯利亞、將使美日戰事之危險於兩星期內趨入新高峯、丹氏云、除非日本能先發制人、以有效方法阻止美援抵蘇否則蘇聯將成爲中英美荷在遠東反日防禦同盟份子之一、又言、蘇聯在海參崴之轟炸機、乃係世上距離日本最近之飛機、丹氏又言、過去三日之事件、使太平洋暫趨平諍，而英美軍寥家具有更大之信心、　係日本現正迅這喪失其漢　軍之中動、但渠又云、所　者　　因斯謂武士精神及　全面子計、戒備加速隅息　、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>八項原則與十四條件</h3>
<p>關於此决延及亞歐非三洲戰爭的目標，在侵略者方面早已公然表示是爲了所謂「新秩序」的建立·換言之·也就是爲了確保各該國家在遠較其本土爲廣大的區域之內的政治經濟雙方的領導和支配。而在民治國方面，其對於摧毀侵略暴力，保全被侵略國的獨立自由，立塲固極鮮明，但却始終缺乏一個顧及全盤的方案。其間屢經美總統在歷屆爐邊談話中宣示其重要信念，邱吉爾與艾登亦曾一再說明英國作戰目標，也迄未釐訂爲槪括的原則。目前距離戰爭結束之期尚遙·以言戰後方案·或未免稍失過早，但所謂戰後方案者實際上亦即作戰的終極目標爲了加强作戰信心，促進勝利實現。決不應讓此一問題長此形成世人心目中一個重大的謎。</p>
<p>現在這一缺憾已在此度羅斯福鴨與邱吉爾的會談之後獲得補償了。自然，英方於十四日所公布的八項原則及那一宣言並非會議中惟一成就，各方所最加重視的，也許更在於那些關防嚴密的如何實際應付歐亞危局的種種步驟。但却絕不容對於這較涉抽象的和平方案忽視其重要含義。使國際大局陷於今日之混亂和黑暗者，無疑前决大戰後的解決方案是重要原因之一，二十年來若干不幸事變都應富從巴黎和會溯其根源，而美國自身之並未參加威爾遜總統所倡導的國際聯盟，更使那一解決國際爭執的政治機構自其開始成立之日就注定了失敗和沒落的命運。是以如果世人不願再蹈前此覆轍，使未來世界能漸决接近理想境地，則這一戰後方案實有首須加以注視的必要。</p>
<p>在此次入項原則之中，前三項申述英美的政治立塲和抱負·中三項表明經濟方面的理想，第七項重申美國傳統政策的海洋自由主張，第八項反對武力的被使用，並着重於侵略國家武裝的解除。雖然這裏只有槪括的原則，其間經緯萬端，關於如何具體實施尚有待於更縝密詳明的探討、但舉凡今日國際間的最大癥結和爭執。則都已提出了正確解決的途徑、爲民治國家對於世界前途所抱博大精微的理想信念，畫出一個提綱挈領的輪廓。在這樣的目標之下，預料必能發揮更偉大的戰鬥力量。使大局早獲澄淸之效</p>
<p>此次八項原則的揭櫫、自然使人立刻聯想到一九一八年威爾遜總統所宣布的十四條件，這裏必須加以說明的就是二者精神固有若干共通之點，但此次却絕非十四條件的重述，相信其亦不致重蹈威爾遜氏失敗的覆轍。第一，十四條件是在若干專家協助之下所組成的威爾遜個人信念，即在美國，亦未能獲得舉國一致的擁護，以是雖在當時受有世人普遍歡迎，却始終缺乏拘束力量：而此决八項原則則爲英美雙方當局協議所得的結論，同時也就是國策的宣揚，步驟的闡明。第二，威爾遜的主張大部分都限於政治上的問題。關於更基本的經濟方面，則殊少建樹，而國際聯盟的組織亦因並未考慮到經濟基礎問題而强使在經濟上相互衝突對立的國家在政治上實行合作以致失敗。此决在經濟方面特加致力，在第四條表示將使各國無論大小强弱抑或戰勝戰敗、皆可以平等條件享受其經濟繁榮所必需的貿易與原料。第五項表示將促使各國在經濟方面充分合作·第六項希望各國在戰勝納粹之後能使各國在其疆界之內安居樂業，這不但將使以「不滿足」爲藉口的侵略者失掉其理論上的根據，而且也是促進世界眞正和平與安寗的必要途徑。第三，在十四條件當中，除却由第六條到第十三條分別陳述對於歐洲雙方各交戰國戰後領土主權等問題的處置而外，其關於如何祛除世界不安及防範未來變亂均少具體見解，一切都委之於國聯去解決，此次英美的共同宣言固不曾提及國聯與其前途，但倘使各項規定都能圓滿遂行，則國際前途可望完全改觀，最後當不難促進各國間更有效的政治合作。對於威爾遜氏及其偉大抱負，吾人初無加以菲薄之意，但無疑此决英美宣言所宣示更較切實而具體，這一點自然是時代的關係、同時也證明了人類理性與智慧都在不斷進化當中。</p>
<p>當前最重要的問題自然是如何取得反侵略戰爭的勝利，同時也史應顧到如何使戰後的一切獲得合理解決，這自然都還是個艱苦的任務，但就目前所已經昭示者看來，可以斷言光明之必將到來，而且也必不會重蹈歷史上失敗的覆轍。</p>

<p>美國名作家赫明威夫婦，今春中香港乘飛幾至韶，再由汽車，馬匹，輪船歷經艱難，以抵前綫視察，對於中國士氣堅强，至爲欽遲。即就泛太平洋無綫電活與Collier's報編奢詳述視察經過，茲特轉譯於后。照片爲名作家赫明威氏所攝，文爲赫明威夫入　Mr.Gellhorn　所著。</p>
<p>赫明威夫婦近攝</p>
<p>由港至韶</p>
<p>我們踏上河岸，在泥淖中跑路。靠近一所竹屋前面，有一小隊兵士站在雨中。面對着小隊兵士的是八個馬夫，頭上戴着一頂圓錐形大草帽，同時還可當傘用，黃油布衣，下身穿短褲和草鞋。他們扣住了七匹馬的馬勒，第八匹馬原先是香港的一匹跑馬。兵士，馬夫，馬匹都給冷雨淋得發抖，水滴從身上淌到軟爛的泥田中。</p>
<p>雨水浸透了的軍隊向我們敬禮後，就上馬出發。我騎的一匹馬忽然大發脾氣，騰躍有如一個小孩一般，把我們的舌人撞下，他只能站在污泥中。馬匹發了脾氣，苦力們敲打馬的鼻子，尖聲打着呼嘯。馬發出一陣長鳴，想去咬馬夫。我們排成單行在一條油滑的小徑中進行。每一馬夫總是跑在馬的前面。八匹馬的姿態像健身房中雷馬一般顚簸翻動。大雨如注，把我們的衣服都浸濕。山溪在雨中頓然顯得漲大了不少，像是要把此地一部份的污穢衣服都蕩滌乾凈的樣子。我們沿着由邊小徑跑去，低頭讓開濕漉漉的矮樹，閃避低垂的樹枝，策馬涉水過小溪時，我們把腿提高，以免浸入水中。一行人在雨中靜靜地前進。</p>
<p>我們是出發赴某戰區前綫去的。五天前，我們黑夜中到香港飛機塲。在那裏等了三小時，以候天氣轉佳。後來氣候報告傳來，據說在南雄飛機，無法升空，濃雲密結，在機上不能觀察，因此飛行即告取消。决日我們在低雲四佈的天空中起飛，歷時一小時又半，經過叢山峻嶺，日軍的佔領錢，在中國後方的泥田中降落。我們弄到了一輛陳奮汽車，於是和另外五個華人登車，在一條黃泥路上迤邐前進，薄暮，抵達韶關。　我們所住旅館名「韶光」，租賃的房間有一小休息室，其中陳設竹椅數事，桌一，兩盞煤油燈，一個痰盂。後面就是一間沒有窗子的臥室，有兩張床舖。再後面由小門通達至浴室，附有面盆，痰孟，和鏡子。我們把床氈和蚊帳打開，（現在雖值天寒，但蚊虫仍多，這種蚊虫飛動遲緩，後脚蜷起－是一種瘧蚊）很高興的在這「皇宮」中住下。</p>
<p>翌日，此地戰區的總司令請我們去吃午飯。他看來像一個溫和愉快的菩薩。在一間暗淡的石塊作墻的房屋中，飮茶，按例五致敬意，談笑了一會。這正式儀節結束後，我們與參謀長等一同進餐。菜餚豐盛，有魚翅湯，皮蛋，竹笋和饅首。就是在嚴禁飮酒的軍隊，對於客人總有些酒預備的。所以總司令與數軍官一一向其他人乾杯致敬。我們在飮酒時敬祝中美二大領袖，委星長眞羅斯福總統的政躬康泰，並祝我等旅程順利。</p>
<p>總司令飲酒多杯，出汗極多，兩個軍官亦面色如酡。舌人亦已醉，赫明威很高興的說敬祝華軍最後勝利時，已訥訥不能贊一辭。我因酒味猛烈，本應乾杯的，只呷了一半。赫明威痛飮無所顧忌，總算爲我們掙了不少面子，後來總司令用華語說酒蹲巳空。鬥酒才告結束。大家暢懷大笑，筵席在歡愉中結束。（未完）作者行在前綫山麓留影，自左起本文作者赫明威夫人古</p>

<h3>泰戈爾訪問的回憶（四）</h3>
<p>— 徐寳謙</p>
<p>泰氏著作等身，早年成名。文字完全用本加里，五十歲時始用英文著述，手譯Gitnnjali名滿全宇。泰氏英文文藝著述，計有：</p>
<p>國際大學</p>
<p>和平鄉本來是一片荒地，為盜賊出沒之所。一八六三年某日，泰氏之父光臨到此，忽然受感，發為禱詞曰：「牠是我生之居所，我心之音樂，我靈之安宅，一於是建立帳幕，以為禱吿之所。盜者為氏父所感，竟棄刀相從。至今校之一隅，有石碑植立，碑上所鐫者，即此　詞也。一九〇一年，泰氏在和平秀創辦學校聚徒五六人。一九一八年藝術學院成立，同年硏究院成立。一九二一年正式改組，更名為國際大學。一九二二年農邨建設院成立，一九三七年，中國學院成立，由　雲山氏主持之。</p>
<p>學校生活</p>
<p>學校以自然為環境，上課多在戶外林間，泰氏以為最能啟發兒童之敎師，即為樹林，晨夕，月光，風雨。每日旦幕，師生禱於林下，唱詩頌神。蓋其敎育之用意，在使個人與帬，自然，及神護，得和諧之關係也。宿舍布置，男女分居。每舍有一敎師，與學生共起居。每日上午七時至十時及下午二時至四時為上課時間，晚間有團體遊戲，並有各種文藝競賽。每遇月圓之夜，全校師生，由女生製膳款待。而女生戶外之舞蹈遊戲，尤為人所鑒賞。全校採男女同學制，唯女生另有家事等課，且另有課外活動之團體。在敎授方面，全校分本部，即中小學，大學及硏究院。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>中小學校</p>
<p>年齡以六歲到十六歲，師生接觸，異常密切。每班人數不得過十五人，課程特別注重校址附近植物之硏究，藉以訓練兒童之觀察力。較長之兒童，並須與村中居民發生接觸。此外，圖書，手工，音樂，亦極注重。手工一門包括製造日用　俱，園藝，道路，木工，紡織及釘　，木刻，油漆等。</p>
<p>大學部</p>
<p>宗旨有二，一以培養　深文藝學術，一以增進學生謀生之技能。歷史敎程，不重政事與戰爭，而重各時期文化上之成績。於印度與外界之關係，尤三致意。凡大學生須明瞭時事，洞悉各國社會情形及新興運動。農村建設學院中設有工業農業各種課程。藝術學院，自一九一八年成立以來，已成為全國主要藝術學院之一。本院藝術作品，自成一派。一方保守印度固有之藝術精神，同時吸收各國藝術之長。其壁畫尤為著名。泰氏本人所製成之譜曲，不下二千五百首，對全國音樂有絕大貢獻。至於舞蹈，本院貢獻，亦頗不小。大學圖書館藏書頗富，除英德法義各種近代文字外，各種現代印度文，梵文，西藏文，中文之書籍，亦頗不少。此外，並有三千種可貴的手抄卷軼。又　中附設有少年圖書。</p>
<p>硏究院</p>
<p>於一九一八年成立，宗旨在建立一東方學術之中區。課程包括吠陀經及古梵文經典，印度敎，耆那敎，佛敎，各種宗敎哲學，印度阿里安語言學，波斯敎文學，巴里文，現代各種印度文，比較宗敎學　。此外，硏究院敎技們正在協助Mlahabharata一書原文之校尠工作，並從西藏文及中文佛經重譯，已經失去之梵文佛經。來硏究院求學之學生，包括英，法，德，挪威，義大利，荷，捷克，奧，荷屬東印度及中國。</p>

<h3>上海局勢異常安定　可確保中立地位　各國人士必須一致合作　美軍維護益決不撤離</h3>
<p>表示兩國將進一步採取一致行動之英美聯合宣言、巳形成一種安定世界之偉大勢力、而民治陣營、亦因是加强、足以戢止侵略國家兇燄之蔓延、並使之消滅、上海環境、數年來始終在侵略勢力包圍之中、尤以月來南進之佈置、增加太平洋上新戰爭之可能性、益使上海之地位、岌岌不可終日、在此種悄形下、有識之士、莫不大聲疾呼、力促英美兩國剷除綏靖主義之遺孽、對遠東局勢、對上海可能遭遇之危機與威脅、不再姑息容忍、而選擇最有效之理論與實踐、維護百年來具有傳統性之上海中立地位於不墜、而今英美旣已發表歷史性保障人類辛福和平之宣言、不啻爲對玩火者之最嚴重警告、使之有所顧忌、</p>
<p>維護上海六大原則　上項意見、乃上海某外僑領袖對新聲社記者所談、又據渠稱、根據英美聯合宜言之八大原則、吾人所擬定一保障上海地位之宜言、（一）上海不可在任何一國擴大權力及攫取領土之野心下犧牲、（二）上海之領土、屬於中國、非依照人民之意旨、不得變更、（三）上海租界當局應尊重人民選擇粗界行政機構形式之權利、租界行政權、應保持傳統之形式、不容任何一國把持操縱、（四）上海之進出口貿易、爲滿足經濟繫榮之需要、必須不受限制、自由往來、（五）海之關係國家、應在各方面竭力合作、應付時艱、而保經濟進步及社會安寗、（六）上海在中國勝利以後、應恢復戰前之和平狀態、人民得安居樂業、獲得生命財產及自由之保障、豐盛有餘、無足恐懼、</p>
<p>華人應具國家意識　要之、爲使上列六項原則神聖不可侵犯、上海五百萬之中西人士、常有最高度之警覺性、西人方而應在英美領導之下、羣策羣力、聯合一致、華人方面應提高純正之國家意識、奠定堅强精神之基礎、任何人能相信上海之合法地位、祗能在辟惡就善之人民決心中保持不墜、否則整個上海有被惡勢力吞噬危險</p>
<p>駐滬美軍決不撤退　昨日本埠日文每日新聞、忽又登載美國駐滬第四聯隊兵士將全部自滬撒退一消息、略謂、美國駐滬第四聯隊兵士、最近已秘密準備撤退、本月二十五日將先撤退一部份至美國及非列濱兩處、足見遠東情勢、已呈緊迫狀態據本埠外籍權威方面人士語平明社記者稱、此項消息、殆與過去此間英商地產之費買、誤會爲英國將自滬撤退一事如出一轍、顯見別有用意、羅邱會議之結果、美國在遠東地位、顯已增强、美國必不放棄上海權益、美駐滬第四聯隊、純爲保護此間美僑之利益而設、果如某方所傳、美駐滬第四聯隊行將撇退、即係美國放棄上海權益之先聲、其不合邏輯、無待贅言、</p>
<p>第四聯隊官員更動　美海軍醫務隊賽斯氏、奉命來滬、任駐滬第四海軍聯隊外科醫務團指揮、以代在任經年之指揮官潘雷齊氏離滬之缺、查指揮業於本月十三日、由馬尼刺乘柯立芝總統輸抵此、昨由第四海軍聯隊正式發表、查指揮於一九一穴年畢業加里芬尼亞醫科大學後、投身美海軍部醫務隊供職、旋調海軍陸戰隊、查指揮於未來滬任職前、曾供職馬尼刺美海部凡時一載、美第四海軍聯隊第一大隊指揮官、亦經官方文告、發表任命皮却少校爲指揮官、皮少校繼查氏乘哈立遜總統輸由舊金山於本月十叫日抵滬、皮少校當第一决世界大戰時、被遣派海外統率第六海軍陸戰隊作戰、曾身受重傷、愈後重上戰綫、聯合潘勳將軍統率軍隊作戰、以其勇敢作戰、先後獲得榮譽之銀質寶星獎章、以及赫德·葛雷·揚子服務將八章、與其他勝利之四戰爭摺刀鈕扣等獎章、另有美海軍新任第四海軍聯隊第三大隊之歇爾隊長、與戚廉姆兩氏、亦已於十四日乘哈立遜總統輸同來履新、</p>
<p>日人認爲可保現狀　據日文大陸新報記載、上海貿易、完全以海外情勢爲轉移、因此對於倫敦·華盛頓·東京之動向、採取愼重注視態度、東京自德英及德蘇戰事相繼爆發後、即採取繼續維持狀態、嗣對英國各銀行發出凍結令後之第二日、英商各公司因無法提取存款、對店員薪資、以無法支付、感受極大困難、嗣後限制稍緩和、但英商方面、所受影響、仍極顯著、其中允以海關統制輸出、船隻不足爲史甚、刻下各美商公司、正與當地總領事館接洽、希望能獲得必要之輸入許可證、而各美商銀行資金之提取、亦比較容易、惟以上海方面統制出口、故滿載貨物來滬之船隻、因無法輸出貨物、祇好空船歸去、然因輸入不受限制、故上海仍將成爲一國際的物資供給地、不論物價如何、物資之供應、決無問題、此種戰時之畸形發展、究能維持至何時、今後頗爲一般人所推測、</p>
<h3>格拉第奉命飛菲　準備戰時航運　調查遠東全部經濟機構　必要時將採取特定行動</h3>
<p>美國總統輪公司主席、曾任國務院幫辦之格拉第氏、奉羅斯福總統命、來遠東作全部經濟調查、俾中英美荷四强軍防之聯繫、得以益趨華固而完善、格氏之來、即對於達東美英航運、亦將重行分配、使亞洲原料運往民治國家、其幾構益爲加善、免一疏忽、落入軸心國之手、茲悉格氏准於明日由美飛抵馬尼刺、然後循荷印馬來亞各地考察、順道將往戰時中國首都一行、此間華方朝野、咸示歡迎、</p>
<p>此行使命集中菲島　據新聲社記者向關係方面探悉、格氏此來、其使命將集中於菲島、俾決定（一）太平洋發生戰事後之可能反響、（二）鑒於戰時船隻缺乏、（甲）美航務委員會微用美輪命令之實施、（乙）美輸代英輸行駛遠東之程度、（丙）美輸替代英輪行駛太平洋、俾抽出噸位、加强英國在大西洋之貨運、（丁）鑒於澳洲希臘輸航行於太平洋之重要、決定出口市塲减失之情况下所需要、（三）農作貸款及其他援助、拯救其經濟、</p>
<p>調整中菲聯絡運動　格拉第於調查第三點時、雖調查範圍僅爲　東各相關各國、而特別對於拯救中國方面、於經濟上、予以更多囊奧助、其菲律濱與中國之關係、此後兩國貿易於緊急狀態下之需要、亦將加以調整、俾美國於最短期內、將中國所需要者、由距華最近之菲島運華、據悉、此事將由美駐菲專員沙意之顧問海斯德氏加以從旁襄助一切、格氏留遠東時期、的須自六星期至八星明、</p>
<p>或將來滬邀集會議　格氏嗣後足跡所遍、將至新加坡·緬甸·荷屬東印度·馬來亞印度·錫蘭·香港·重慶、皆在視察之列、並或將來上海一行、格氏並擬與各國經濟專家集議、然後將經濟資產及各地機構、列成一表、以便於採取行動時、加以特定行動、如禁邋油類、財政合作等、或統制遠東與太平洋航務時應用、</p>
<p>航運問題　特予攷慮　另一方面、格氏之目的、係獲取關於民主國家在對太平洋上戰爭之威脅所可用之一切經濟力量之詳細資料、至於凍結實施令發表後、在華及對日之凍結、均在格氏調查範圍以內、美商以後遠東航運問題、允爲此來所注意者之一、蓋航運爲戰爭中之生命錢也、按格氏早歲畢業美國巴的摩爾之聖瑪利學院、旋執敎於紐的、一九一九年任商務參贊渡英後、擢升爲國務院帮辦、本年初、被任美國總統輸公司總經理之職、</p>

<h3>清寒學生渴望者同清和援助　助學訪問記之九</h3>
<p>「命運將使我墮入失學的苦海，忽然見到了申報讀者助學金的義舉，眞使我快樂得什麼似的，急急地趕辦了手續，默默地禱告成功，天天盼望着調查員的蒞臨，希望得到同情和援助。」</p>
<p>這是一位遭遇很不幸，環境將不允許她繼續求學的女學生誠摯的呼籲。</p>
<p>她的父親在戰事發生後調往重慶服務，二年前的薪金是七十元。所幸留居在上海的祇有她和她的母親二個，並且寄居在姨母家裏，房租不出，所以開支很少，靠着父親匯寄來的少數款項，和母親針綫所得的報酬，刻苦維持生計，有時還能稍有餘蓄，不料她父親自去年春天起，忽然斷了音訊，幾次雙掛號的去信也沒有得到回執，截至現在爲止，還沒有方法得到她父親是吾安全的確實消息。經濟方面當然成了問題，所有的些微積蓄，已經完全用罄，現在的膳食便也依賴了並非富有的咦母家中。在這樣的境况下，她要繼續求學，是多麼的困難啊！</p>
<p>當她母親申述她們的境遇時，聲音在顫抖着，眼眶在紅着；女兒低垂了頭，默默地似乎在體會遭遇的苦痛。</p>
<p>「盼望於先生們的幫助，正像希望得到我父親的音訊一樣的迫切」！</p>
<p>這是這位求學心很切，環境將不允許她繼續學業的女學生誠摯的寄語。（Ｃ）</p>
<p>可紀念的過程</p>
<p>一位敎會女中的高材生；她經歷過人生荊棘的旅途。下面記述的一段，便是她一生可以紀念的過程：</p>
<p>無情的砲火，燬滅了她的家鄕，家中僅有的少許房產，化爲灰燼。在四年前的這時節，於地方情形極度混亂，公共交通十分不便中，跟了父母，領了弟弟，逃出了戰地－家鄕，來到了上海。但上海旣沒有可以依靠的親友，又沒有能力租賃房屋，便只得投入了徐家匯天主堂所主辦的難民收容所，度着難民的生活。很欣幸的，那難民所裏也有着難童學校的設備，她就在難民所內繼續她的學業，一年後，那時上海一隅的戰事，巳告平靜，該所也就辦理遺散了。當然她們也不能例外。但是她本人却因在該所學校內的成績優異，蒙天主堂某神父的特別提携，保送到鄰近的某敎會女中繼續求學，一切學雜膳宿等費，都由這位神父供給，這二年她能安心用功求學，可以說完全是那位神父所賜。誰知好景不常，那位神父忽然於本年春間奉命他調，繼仟的神父，因爲她不是敎徒，便結束了她的優遇，學校方面也因同樣的理由，拒絕了她的優待。從本學期起，一切必須和其他的學生一樣，繳納學雜膳宿等費，這一個相當鉅大的數額，四她怎樣去籌措呢！雖然說她父親自從回鄕後，從事於整理他舊有的商業，巳能勉强維持家裹的費用，但對於女兒偌大的敎育費，仍然是無法應付。經她父親東拼西凑，纔集成了一個數目，但距離所需的費用，還是相差很多，她不得巳便向本報申請一部份的學雜費。希望得到同情和援助，以竟她求學的志願。</p>
<p>誠懇的態度，端正的品行，尤其是這位學生的優點。（Ｃ）</p>
<p>日擬在滬　增設司法領事</p>
<p>日本外務省、最近鑒於在華日僑人數增多、訴訟案件、亦隨之激增、原有司法領事人員不敷、故擬添設司法總領事、下置領事副領事二十八名、書記生二十六名、刻巳派定外務省條的司第二科長佐藤俊太郎、於下月中句來滬、與駐滬日總領事館接洽、關於設置司法總領事事宜、</p>
<p>煤球撤消限價　籌劃平賣</p>
<p>自煤球售價頻頻抬高以還、升斗小民益受嚴重威脅、上海市機製煤球業同業公會爲籌商善策、定於今日召開執監委員會議、昨巳正式繕發通告、據該會各委員稱、現有五大煤球廠、竟敢藉端企圖退出木會、以遂其漲價慾望、惟本會始終一貫、爲全體會員謀福利、決不容若輩倒行逆施、本會該日集議者的有下列各點、（一）計劃繼續領導全體同業、主辦平價煤球、（二）建議兩租界當局、改善煤球評價辦法、期收著效、（三）籌商制裁非法煤奸商具體辦法、</p>
<h3>道教源流攷  楊中一</h3>
<p>融五講經社第二十决講經，楊中一君講「道敎源流玫」，丁仲祜君講「却病療養法」，二君先後更迭講演，聽衆格外注意，故興會特佳，到底不懈。楊君道敎源流攷云：中庸言「修道」，孔子曰「一貫」，道本公名，莊子天下篇以道術起，史公六家要旨以道德結，皆非漢志之道家。漆園以「一曲之士，得一自蔽，道術裂而爲方術」，蘭綾以「道體常而盡變，六子之蔽，皆道之一隅」，雖博大眞人如老聃，蒙叟但云古之道術有在干是者」，未敢遽以內聖外王之道許之」。</p>
<p>自班固采劉向七略以志藝文，始以黃老雖道家，後漢襄楷傳「黃老垺屠」並稱，南史陶宏景傳「道人道士」並稱，尚以沙門號道人，是道爲三敎之公名。秦皇，漢武，並好方士，桓譚新論尚稱方士，時未有道敎之名」。</p>
<p>王莽時，有道士西門君惠，後漢第五倫傳始「號爲道士」。襄楷傳順帝時，瑯琊宮崇，上其師，于吉神書百七十卷，號「太平淸領書」，三國志張魯傳，「祖陵，學道鵠嗚山，造道書」，雲笈七籤二十八「付天師張道陵，受正一盟威之道」。宋陳元靜歲時廣記，有漢天師家傳，茶香室三鈔卷十八天師條引之，子衡，孫魯，後漢皇甫嵩傳，「鉅鹿張角」號太平道。典略「漢中有張修」，號五斗米道，角誅修亡，魯據漢中，後降曹操，號天師道。子盛，移江西龍虎山，續道統。宋大中祥符八年，賜龍虎山張正隨號虛靜先生，建上淸觀。元至元十三年，召六十六代張宗演，封嗣漢天師，演道靈應冲和眞人，世襲領江南道敎。傳至今張恩溥，六十三代，其父曉初孝廉，工詩詞。癸亥冬，李佳白博士請往尚賢堂講道敎眞理，時余爲國際敎務聯合會孔敎總代表，因得與酬唱。</p>
<p>晋王義之傳「王氏世事張氏五斗米道」，孫恩傳「世奉「五斗米道」，叔父泰，爲會稽王道子所誅，恩襲會稽，害內史王凝之」。鍾嶸詩品謝靈運，家以子孫難得，寄養天師道所設之杜治，十五歲還，故名客兒」。</p>
<p>道敎始于三國而盛于六朝，史記始皇紀集解引太原眞人第盈內紀「曾祖濛」，即謠云「神仙得者茅初成，駕龍上升入太淸，繼世而往在我盈」。按世系作高祖濛，曾祖偃，祖熹，父祚。生司命君盈，定錄君固，保命君表南朝號三茅道。晋葛洪傳「從祖玄吳時得仙術授鄭隱，洪就隱學」，作抱朴子百六十篇，言黃白者名內篇</p>
<p>梁陶弘景傳，「得葛洪神仙傳，有養生志，隱句容句曲山，即第八洞宮，者金壇華陽之天，漢咸陽三茅君得道處。」按茅山志及陶隱居眞誥，開祖南嶽魏夫人，以黃庭經傳司徒公府長史楊義，再傳護軍長史許穆，八傳而至山中宰相陶貞白。魏書釋老志「道士寇謙之，太上老君授天師位，賜雲中音誦新科之誡二十卷，牧土上師李譜文授鑲圖眞經，太武崇奉改元太平眞君，諸帝即位，必親至道壇受符籙，」儼然羅馬敎皇。抱朴子遐覽篇，有魏伯陽內經，五代後蜀彭曉參同契解義序云，「密示靑州徐從事，徐隱名注之，桓帝時，復授同郡淳于叔通。」朱子與蔡元定訂正之，爲作考異化名空同道士鄒訢。</p>
<p>按眞仙譜系，老聃傳東華，再傳漢鍾離權，三傳唐呂巖，開金丹一派。巖傳遼劉操，其徒張瑞以悟眞篇著稱，累傳而有南宗七眞之名。又傳金王嘉，分爲北宗七派，而邱長春獨受元祖隆遇，統管僧道，號全眞敎，見釋祥邁至元辯偽錄。又元史釋老志，志于全眞正一兩派外，又云「金劉德仁五傳至酈希誠，見知憲宗號眞八道。」「金蕭抱珍傳太三元法鑲，敎號太一。」道藏經典，肇始漢志道家術數方伎諸書，然道家究非道敎也。</p>
<p>漢末有太平經，晋以後道經漸繫，見抱朴子遐覽篇。隋書經籍志，宋鄭樵通志藝文略，張君房靈笈七籤序，稱天富寶藏錄成七藏。明白雲霄道藏目錄詳注，分爲洞眞·洞玄·洞神·太玄·太平·太淸·正一七部，號三洞四輔。又有續道藏，道藏輯要等，皆沿行至今。</p>

<p>本文作者陳鳳書教授，早歲留英，專攻經濟，回國後，即供職金融界，並兼任聖約翰及大同大學等敎務值此凍結效果未見而惡現象頻生之日，各方對於此「問題，益覺嚴重。本刋過去數期已了表多文，有所論述；現又得陳教授此文之夾論，幸讀者注意之。　（編者）</p>
<p>美國凍結外國資金意義</p>
<p>凍結資產之意義，即所有外國在美動產及不動產之享受及使用權，一概暫予剝奪按凍結之範圍，的有兩種：一爲全部凍結，如凍結德義及其估領國之資金是也；爲　部份凍結，如此次凍結中日在美之資產是也；蓋美仍與中日兩國維持正常國際貿易，但以獲取許可證者及現金買　爲限</p>
<p>至於凍結資產之目的，概括言之，不外下列三點：（一）凍結資產，具有經濟制裁之作用，如凍結德，義，日三國資產是也；（二）防止資產移轉於侵略者之手，如凍結丹麥挪威以及中國淪陷區之資產是也；（三）具有援助友邦經濟政策之推行，如此决徇中國政府之請求而凍結中國在美之資產是也。</p>
<p>北歐諸國凍結經過</p>
<p>茲將美國凍結外資產之經過，略述如次：自去歲四月間，歐戰擴大至北歐諸國時，美國遂開始實行凍結在美歐洲淪陷國之資金。當一九四〇年四月八日，德軍向丹麥及挪戚進攻之時，美國乃根據一九一七年十月六日所施行對敵交易取締法，於四月十日，遂將丹麥及挪戚兩國在美之資產，加以凍結。其後戰事日益擴大，而凍結之國家亦日增，茲依决言之：五月十日，荷蘭比利時及盧森堡三國在美之資產，美政府予以凍結。六月－七日，美政府復宣佈凍結法國在美之資產。七月十五日，又宣佈凍結拉脫維亞愛沙尼亞以及立陶宛三國在美之資產。十月十日，又宜佈凍結羅馬尼亞在美之資產。本年三月十三日，美政府復將匈牙利在美之資產，加以凍結。三月二十五日，叉宜佈凍結南斯拉夫在美之資產。叫月二十八八日，希臘在美之資產，巳被凍結。六月十四日，德·奧·但澤·捷克·波蘭·義大利·及阿爾巴尼亞等七國在美之資產，一一加以凍結。美國自去年四月十日，凍結丹麥挪威至此决凍結中日之資產止，其凍結之國家，已有二十四國之多；被凍結之資產，的在六十萬萬美元以上。此外尚有芬蘭·葡萄牙·西班牙·瑞典·瑞士·蘇聯等六國，在美之資產，亦均置於有條件之凍結令下，蘇德戰事爆發後，蘇聯之資產則已予以解凍。</p>
<p>中國資金被凍結之概況</p>
<p>自七月一十六日美英相繼凍結中日資金後，荷印亦步美英之後塵，而宣佈凍結日本在荷印之資金；同時日本亦巳採取反凍結之報復手段，而宣佈凍結美英荷印在日本及其佔領地之資金；此種經濟戰爭之經過措施，以及影響於中國之戰時經濟諸端，茲爲篇幅所限，僅就美英凍結中國資金之經過及其影響，擬作一簡要說明如次</p>
<p>美國凍結並不徹底</p>
<p>美國財政部　於七月二十六日宣佈凍結日本資金，二十七日起即生效，同時美國政府徇中國政府之請求，而宣佈凍結中國在美之資金，至於凍結中國資金之理由，的而言之，不外下列數點：（一）美政府凍結中國在美之資金後，那可阻止中國資金成入美國與中國以外之區域；（二）俾使中國政府對其人民所有之資金，皆有統制之權；（三）此舉足以防止日人利用中國法幣而套取外匯。</p>
<p>美國爲維持中美兩國正常貿易起見，乃發出五十八及五十九兩號一般照會，授權予中國十叫家外商銀行，得在中國境內經營外匯，並授權各該銀行，對於中國之任何部份（東北除外）與美國·拉丁美洲·英帝國·蘇聯以及荷印間之進出口貿易，予以金融上之協助。此十四家銀行，即大通。花旗·友邦·美國通運，（以上四家爲美商）匯豐·有利·麥加利·通濟隆·老沙遜·新沙遜·及沙遜銀行，（以上七家爲英商）莫斯科國民銀行，（蘇聯）和蘭銀行·安達銀行，（以上爲荷商）但對封存之美金存款，則不得請求轉移與提款；上述之銀行，在未發給信用證書，承受或支付匯票，或根據進出口貿易而准許之其他付款或轉賬等情形，必領符合下列之條件：（一）此種貿易必須爲正當之進出口，而其進出口貨品之價值，必須相當於所申請外滙之數額：（二）此種進出口，須符合本照會所規定之條款。</p>
<p>美國政府對於中國之國家銀行，另有照會送達，指示辦法，略述如次：美政府發給中中交農四行之照會，其內容與發給十四家外商銀行之照會略有出入，該項照會准許中中交農四行買賣外滙，惟其範圍限於一般照會所規定者；至於經營外滙之其他華商銀行，此後於可能限度內，仍可繼續經營外滙業務，但在七月二十六日以前，尚未了結之外滙業務，則由中央銀行處理之。茲將其辦法分別述之如次：</p>
<p>美國政府給予中央銀行之一般照會，則爲第六十號，此項照會特許中央銀行接受人民之請求，以中央銀行之名義，而將其被封存之存款支付或轉帳於國內銀行，或將已被封存之有價證券，轉移於國內銀行。至於七月二十六日以前，所有華商銀行買賣之外滙，統由中央銀行代爲收付，但此項收付外匯，係指並不在凍結之列之外滙而言；其代收付外滙之日期，則於八月十五日截止。此項牧付外滙之實際辦法分述如左。</p>
<p>（一）支付外滙辦法華商銀行如須支付外匯時，必須立即電交倫敦或紐約之大通銀行，請其收入中央銀行（中國）之帳內；同時請求倫敦或紐的之大通銀行回電至上海分行，轉告上海之中央銀行，證實該款業已收訖；再由中央銀行代申請者轉付予原受款人，但該受款人必須爲未被凍結國之人民。（Unblocked　National）　（二）買入外滙辦法中央銀行以其本行之名義，代申請之華商銀行收受應得之外滙，逕收入該華商銀行之帳內，如提存時，須依照規定條款辦理之，美國政府給予中國·交通·中農三行之一般照會，則爲六十一號，其內容與發給十四家外商銀行者大致相同，故從略。</p>
<p>關於華商銀行經營外滙者，以未經美國政府之特准，按理將不得冉行經營外滙業務，但美國對於中國資金之凍結，並不澈底，故於正常進出口貿易之外匯業務，仍可經營，但對於投機買賣則絕對不得承做</p>
<p>英國辦法較爲嚴密</p>
<p>英國政府於七月二十九日徇中國政府之請求，而宣亦凍結中國之資金，其帝國政府亦相繼照辦，英國政府乃於七月二十九日，即行通知在華之英商銀行，無論共在中國或中國以外之分行，所有英鎊存款，債券及現金，悉應封存。此外對於中國及英鎊集團區域之進出口貿易，仍予資助，並得淮行某種　兌交易。</p>
<p>關於申請供給英鎊辦法，英國政府巳授權匯豐·麥加利·有利三銀行，凡已立戶之商人，其　用行爲，必須經三行經理認爲確實可靠者，則可向三行中請供給外滙；但在申請書中，必須詳細載明，付給何地何行，購買何種貨品，以及需要之數目，送請三行經理核准後，然後付以外滙支票，准其動用。其辦法甚爲謹愼嚴密，至其詳細辦法則不得而知。</p>
<p>美英兩國凍結中國資金之概况？已略如上述，茲就其不同之點加以詳述：查英政府所指定之英商銀行，對於中國外滙存戶付給法幣之辦法，予以廢止，英鎊存款債券及現金一併予以對存，絕對不得自由提取；但美商銀行對中國美金存戶，仍可依照黑市滙價折合而付給法幣，故英商銀行之辦法，較美商銀行爲嚴密。</p>
<p>中國經濟所受影響</p>
<p>自美英兩國實行凍結中日資金後，而日本亦採取反凍結之措置，對於上海一般經濟之影響，自不待言，茲僅就貿易·外滙·內滙·金市</p>
<p>物價數方面，加以概括之檢討：</p>
<p>貿易　上海之貿易情形，自實行凍結後，並無顯著之變動，蓋資金雖被凍結，而正常之國際貿易，仍可依照一般照會之規定而辦理之，凡進口商所需要之外滙，則可向指定之十四家銀行請求購結；而出口商所獲得之外滙，亦可向該十四家銀行出售；但在被禁止貿易之貨物，其來源自然中斷，而必須品之進口，如無其他政治之變動，自可繼續採講。</p>
<p>外滙　自凍結資金後，上海黑市，法幣對美金及英鎊之價值，均趨下降，按理本應上昇，究其原因，不外下列數點：（一）日商銀行在資金尚未被凍結前，深恐一旦被凍，則將無法運用，遂速日大量拋售外滙，迨至美政府將凍結令頒佈後，始悉並不如預料之嚴密，益以修正令之頒布，更顯凍而不結，乃重行補進，致使滙市緊縮。（二）在投機在潮中，空方深恐無法獲致外滙以抵補，不得不竭力及早購進，遂致滙率更趨緊縮；此後黑市滙率應漸趨於穩定，其理由不外下列二點：（一）外滙之投機買賣，旣爲凍結令所制，而對於滙率之壓力因之减少：（二）依照第五十九號一般照會之規定，今後之貿易，必須爲正常進出口，非正常之進口，爲之减少，粽上所述二種理由，故黑市滙率將趨於穩定、</p>
<p>內滙　自美英相繼宣佈凍結資金後，上海之銀行家與財政家，急電其內地各分行，出售上海法幣，致數年來變動微細之滙市，大起波動；例如八月一日滙率之上昇，竟達百元之鉅；數年來上海滙市之變動，往往爲重慶昆明所影響，而此决之變動，上海竟由被動而處於主動地位，一般以爲此後滙率將繼續上昇，而達於上海內地間平滙之趨勢；詎事實所示，則不盡然，而滙率反趨下降，究其原因，厥爲香港巳成法幣避難之尾閭，內地資金紛向該地移動，其原因的有下列四點：（一）香港華人得自由以法幣購買港幣；（二）香港居民得自由提取港幣存款，不受限制，非居民經核准後亦可照辦；（三）每人每月得滙法幣一千五百元至金鎊以外集團，鉅數經核准後，亦可照辦；（四）在金鎊集團內，並可購貿其他貨幣。</p>
<p>金市　自凍結令頒佈發，外滙滙率頓形緊縮，金價因之在漲，且因黑市現金不在凍結之列，故購買者日衆，金價益高，按金價之變動，係根據滙豐銀行之貿易滙率，設若滙豐銀行貿易滙率，停止掛牌，則黑市黃金市塲之存在，恐亦發生動搖。</p>
<p>物價　上海物價，本已無法統制，自凍結令頒佈後，一般人民過份惶慮，以爲外滙旣難獲得，則外貨進口自然减少，將來勢必趨於高漲；投機者以外滙旣被凍結，大量游資正無出路，遂乘機興風作浪，竭力操縱囤積，滬市物價遂致節節上勝；此爲暫時現象，將來之趨勢如何，則所關係之因素甚多，殊難預料。</p>
<h3>中國的農貸  陳禾章</h3>
<p>中國農村過去久苦於資金的枯竭，而迭成高利貸的普遍現象。據中央農業實騐所農情報告，全國負債農家，佔農戶總數百分之六十二，借錢的農家佔百分之五十六，借物的農家佔百分之四十八。至農民借款的來源，據農情報告的分析，百分之二十五來自商人，百分之二四·二來自地主，百分之一八·四來自富農，百分之一三·一來自商店，百分之八·八來目典當，百分之五·五來自錢莊，百分之二·六來自合作社，百分之二·四來自銀行，可知農民資金的週轉來自新式余融機構者不過百分之五，而百分之九十五則由地主，鄕紳，商店，典當及其他高利貸者所支配。農村經濟枯竭的情形，由此己可概見一斑。</p>
<p>農貸的需要</p>
<p>然而增加農業生產，調整土地利用與分配。以及改進農產運銷，在在需要賴於圓滑資金的融通。自民國十六年北伐成功後，政府鑒於農業金融的迫切需要，於是有新式農業金融機關的創設。、此時中國金融界也轉移目光於農村方面，實行農村放款，同時更注意到農業倉庫的經營。一般水深火熱的農民，雖未能完全解除一切金融上壓迫的痛苦，確亦獲得相當的利益。</p>
<p>到蘆溝橋戰事發生爲止，全國性的農業金融機關，有中國農民銀行與農本局，，省單位的農業金融機關有江蘇省農民銀行，江西省合作金庫，四川省台作金庫及各省地方銀行；縣單位的農業金融機關，有浙省的縣農民銀行，縣農民借貸所，各縣市的縣市合作金庫等。此外，尚有一般公私銀行也經營農貸業務，如中國銀行，交通銀行，上海銀行，金城銀行等。其後四聯總處添設農業金融處，負調整全國農貸業務。所以農貸業務頗呈蓬勃氣象</p>
<p>最近的動態</p>
<p>軍興以後，政府對農貸的推行，更是不遺餘力。農貸的數字，年有增加，據四聯總處報告，各政府自二十八年穴月至二十九年二月止，對各省的農貸，計達一五一，三二四，四八一·四六元。其分配情形，依區域，列表示之如下：</p>
<p>從上表看來，四川省佔最大部分，其比例爲百分之二八·〇八：其决爲江西，佔百分之七·八六；再决爲江蘇，佔百分之七·八二。至於山西及綏遠因環境特殊，故所佔成分極微。</p>
<p>如依農貸對象分類，則合作社佔總數百分之四七·二三；合作金庫佔百分之二七·二一；農倉佔五·四三。其群情如下表：</p>
<p>又據四聯總處後决的報告，二十九年份放給各省的農貸，共爲二〇九，五〇二，一六七元。茲列表明之如下：省份農貸數（單位元）百分比四川　八〇、七四大、三八五　二八·五四西康　八四七、〇〇〇　〇·四〇貴州　一四、二二三、五八九　六·七九廣西　一二、一七八、七九七　六·〇〇寗夏　四〇大、〇〇〇　〇·一九雲南　七、八七四、〇三三　三·七六湖南　一八、三〇六、三四二　八·七四江西　二、三八五、四四〇　五·四三廣東　六〇　四、四四四　〇·二九浙江　四、八七三、〇四一　二·三五河南　四、五七五、五三一　二·一八陝西　一三、一五一、七八三　六·二八甘肅　九、七一一、〇〇〇　四·六四江蘇　一、九大一、五四五　〇·九四安徽　八、四三九、〇〇〇　四·〇三河北　一、四一四、〇〇〇　〇·六八綏遠　五七、〇〇〇　〇·〇三山東　三、一三六·〇〇〇　一·五四湖北　八、〇六大、六三五　三·八五福建　一、一九二、〇〇〇、〇·五七山西　二〇二、〇〇〇　〇·一〇其他　六六五、六〇二　〇·三二川黔陝湘邊區　五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇二·三九總計　二〇九、五〇二、一六七　一〇〇、〇〇</p>
<p>由上表、可知除陝西省以外、農業金融的流通，多集中於西南諸省、四川·貴州·廣西·雲南及湖南五省的農貸，即達一三三，七二九，一四六元，而佔總數在分之六三·八三·　（未完）</p>

<h3>維他命  菲</h3>
<p>在　食物中的維他命，對於身體的發育和健康的保持，疾病的預防，都是必需的，現在把各種維他命的功用和來源，分述於後：</p>
<p>維他命Ａ：能彀輔助發育，增加精力，保護身體，預防鼻部喉部和肺部疾病。孕婦，乳母和兒童，更爲需要，黃色和綠色食物中，都有維他命Ａ，經過高熱和長時期的暴露在空氣中，足以减少維他命Ａ的成分。</p>
<p>來源：魚肝油，牛奶，乳酪，肝，蛋黃，腰子。菠菜，萵苴，靑豆，蕃薯，番茄，蘆够，卷心菜。香蕉，桃子，橘子，棗子，西瓜等。</p>
<p>維他命Ｂ：可以促進發育，使胃口增進，消化力强，因爲能在水中溶解，有時候把食物在水中洗滌以後，維他命Ｂ的成分就失去了。</p>
<p>來源：牛奶，腰子，腦，肝，心，精肉，蠔。榖食，豆，蕃薯，葱，卷心菜，甜菜葉。檸檬，橘子，香蕉，頻菓，棗子，米，麥，麥片，杏仁，胡桃，花生等。</p>
<p>維他命Ｃ：這是保持身體健康的必需品，旣能扺禦疾病，使有創口者早日復原，並能防止蛀牙和牙齦病和壞血病。</p>
<p>來源：橘子，楊梅，西瓜，檸檬，香蕉，蘋菓。卷心菜，番茄，蕃薯，葱，黃瓜，玉蜀黍等。</p>
<p>維他命Ｄ：人身需要維他命Ｄ去調整體內的鈣質和燐質，身體在陽光下照射可以得到維他命Ｄ。維他命Ｄ更能防止軟骨病。</p>
<p>來源：最好的來源是魚肝油，此外如牛奶，蛋黃，乳酪，蠔和沙丁魚中，都有維他命Ｄ的成份。</p>
<h3>怎樣洗綢衣  一元</h3>
<p>在　這炎熱的夏日，着絲綢衣服是比着布質的衣服輕飄，而且又是比較地舒適，但是，爲着我們身體有許多汗液排泄出來，必須時常地洗換，方合於衛生之道，可是絲綢衣服一類的東西，質地大抵是比別種衣料來得薄，稍不經意，很容易被損壞，這裏有種簡易方法，介紹給讀者：</p>
<p>一：無論那一種綢衣，如果要洗滌的話，可以用楊柳樹葉煎成液汁，把這液汁輕輕洗濯，洗妤之後，要放置在陰暗的地方陰乾，不要放在陽光下面暴曬，可以使原色不褪。</p>
<p>二：如果綢衣是白色的，切忌用河水和肥皂洗滌，否則汚處容易被吸住不下，應先用豆腐在汚處揉搓，然後再用淸水洗濯，放在陰處使乾，便可潔白如新。</p>
<p>三：洗白綢衣最好而最簡單的方法，莫如用肥皂片，溫解在溫水中，把衣服放入，用軟刷或海綿輕輕地摩擦，最後加醋酸（或硫酸）一二滴，將洗浄的衣服，浸五六分鐘，這樣可以增加絲的光澤，洗淨後宜於陰乾。</p>
<p>四：洗滌淺顏色的綢衣，宜用檸檬少許傾入沸水之中，待其冷後方可洗滌，洗畢，放在透風的地方吹到牛乾，收下摺好皺痕，然後再晾乾，切忌曬在日光之下。</p>
<p>五：如果你要想使布的身骨堅實的話，那麽在你洗綢衣時，先將皂片放進暖水略加浸溶，再把衣服浸透，然後取出用軟刷輕刷，最後用溫水，淸洗二三遍。也可以拿衣服放入溶解了阿摩尼亞的溫水中，浸了不久，拿出來用淸水洗淨，這種洗法，往往能使你有件堅實的綢衣。</p>
<p>六：萬一不幸有血沾上你底白綢衣，這時，您可別大驚小怪，趕快把它卸下，把海棉或布片蘸水洗表裏兩面，或者用白布一塊放在汚處，上面放一塊冰也好還有一種方法，就是將白蘿蔔，削成薄片，放在血點上，但需更換幾决，血汚就完全被牠吸去，然後再用冷水洗滌，但切忌熱水。</p>
<p>其他洗漲綢衣的方法，常然還有很多，不過上列六種方法要是你能熟記的話，巳經足彀應付你洗綢衣時所感到的困難了！</p>
<h3>綠紗窗設計  長俊</h3>
<p>窗　子多，窗口大，能夠使空氣暢快流通。本來是居室的主耍條件之一，特別是在初秋的熱大。然而如果因爲流通空氣，而使蚊蠅在室內猖獗，甚至危及健康，那就得不償失了。</p>
<p>兩全之道，只有裝置紗窗</p>
<p>在都會裏，西式建築的高貴家庭，對於這些，本來是一點也沒有問題的。他們設備完全，窗子寬大而多，裏外業置鐵紗，窗上有明淨的玻璃，把窗子打開，空氣旣極易流通，蚊蠅無從飛入</p>
<p>但是普通家庭，切設備，都沒有那麽完美，但到了熱天，因爲生活的需要，於是代替品－絲紗窗使產生了。雖然在效用上不及鐵紗窗那樣好，可是在經濟條件下，仍是値得介紹的。</p>
<p>自己製造，並不困難，只耍預備些綠紗，綠紗有粗細兩種，我們最好用細的一種，因爲白蛤子能從組紗的隙際進來，如果要糊組紗，必須糊雙層，似乎又不合算。</p>
<p>糊製的方法，是用粗麻繩紮成個糊刷，漿糊耍黏的，以糊刷先在窗櫃周圍刷一層漿糊，再把綠紗貼上，或是先以按釘，再就窗紗上刷漿糊，等窗紗糊平，再徹夫按釘，沿窗框邊上，糊一層白紙取齊，這樣比較好看一些。</p>
<h3>驅除蒼蠅法  得之</h3>
<p>時　　秋季，蒼蠅尙四出活動，傳播病菌，吾人於此，勞彿遭遇無數之無形轟炸機，向吾人作漫無限制之擲彈工作，其危險孰甚，故熱季之蒼蠅，實爲人類之大敵。</p>
<p>蠅之傳播細菌，蠅之種類雖多，然其媒介病菌者，，大都爲屬於家蠅科之蠅，其長喙，能自由伸縮，前端廣而內有無數細襞，所以便於吮物舐物，肢有毛，末端有粘盤分泌一種粘性分泌物，所以便其粘附於物，故蒼蠅若停於有菌之飲食物，或有菌之糞便上，從其喙吸入無數細菌，又從其足粘附無數細菌，再飛至另一食品之上，必立時傳播無數細菌，蓋不待言而明矣。對於蒼蠅之傳播細菌，據達尼爾爵遜氏愛司顚氏等之研究，先使蒼蠅不粘附細菌，再縱之於不潔之處，經一定時間，捕而檢查之，則見每蠅平均粘附有十萬以上之細菌，又就自然飛翔之家蠅四十只，用種種方法，詳加檢查，見每蠅最少者粘附細菌五百五十萬，最多者粘附細菌六百六十萬，又查取多之菌，爲大腸菌，對於人類之直接危險，幸而較少，然此菌與傷寒菌，赤痢菌，假性傷寒菌，霍亂菌等，頗有因緣，故以上各種病菌類，一有機會，亦常可粘附於蠅，隨之而傳播。蠅之驅除法：欲驅除此極危險之蒼蠅，宜在其卵蛆蛹未化蠅以前，即將其剿滅，普通以煤油乳劑，石灰硫黃劑，除蟲菊，木炭粉，漂白粉，粗製苦列曹兒肥皂等，傾入糞坑垃圾桶等發生蒼蠅之處，每二週間傾入决，然傾入藥品後，仍不免間有蒼蠅發生，最好能設法遮斷蒼蠅之交通，此法允爲妥當。捕蠅之法，雖有捕蠅紙，玻璃製捕蠅器等等，但其誘蠅方法不佳，致效果亦少，最簡最佳之方法，可用福爾麻林，牛乳，及水之混合液盛於皿中，置於蠅多之處，蠅往舐，即死於其近處，此種中毒捕蠅法，尙有種種，最多者用除蟲菊紛或丸，惟用此，每致藥品飛散於四週，又蒼蠅死屍散亂各處，目中毒程度之輕者，又立時可以復生，此二端爲其缺點，故不如用福爾麻林牛乳及水之混合液爲佳也。</p>
<h3>素食輯語　（編者）</h3>
<p>素食與迷信，在國人心理中，常有混合之誤，以爲素食者必係迷信之徒，不迷信者，不尙素食也，此以我國之吃素者，其動機輙起於奉佛，即六月素一種，亦以雷齋素稱之，以致一般主張破除迷信者，幷素食亦認爲不値提倡，此實大謬也。</p>
<p>稍具欽食常識者，成知肉類之營養，種遜於菜蔬，蓋肉類所無之維他命及續物質，英蔬有之，而肉類恒有之毒素廢料及寄生蟲等，菜蔬則俱無有之也。再言消化，淸潔，經濟等等，亦皆菜蔬遠勝肉類，故素食爲絕對衛生，已無疑　，是以聞蘭亭丁福保諸先進，除實行素食外，復立素食會以提倡之，此外復有世界蔬食聚餐會之舉行，參加者俱屬一時彥俊，可見宗敎之信仰由人，而素食之奉行，實爲衛生之要道也。</p>
<p>要本食譜以國內智識中人，漸知素食之價値，並以素食之確有提倡必耍，因擬採取各種素食之烹調方法，以供參考，朱子云園蔬逾珍羞，園能烹調得法，則朶頤之快，寧稍讓於熊掌駝峰哉。諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油，鹽，醬，醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當卽專差送奉，不取送力。</p>
<p>一星期家常菜單　玉　蜀黍又稱苞米，俗稱珍珠米，是人人愛吃的東西，內中包含維他命很豐富，常吃是很有益於身體的。它雖可當作點心吃，而一粒粒剝了下來，也可以做菜，那種香味大可開胃。近來我家就常常利用它來做湯。做葷的，可和牛肉捲心菜馬鈴薯一同淸燉，有時和雞雜火腿片同煮，允其鮮美。做素的，可和雞毛菜毛豆子同淸燉，也覺得淸杳可口，這種吃法，比了吃整個的玉蜀黍，來得有意味些，讀者們何妨一試。</p>

<h3>一個提議　推行家庭教師運動　葛椿　課家庭教育補學校不足課餘教讀可自闢生路</h3>
<p>讀了「申請助學金的兩個大學生」之後，對社會，我有一個小小的提議。　供給大學生們的助學金，我以爲學程高了一些覺得一方面好像不勞而穫，另一方面又似乎略略减低了他們的自尊心。爲了這個綠故，陋見以爲不如讓他們半工半讀來的好。並月還有許多人不願倚賴父親的血汗求學，可是又不願剝奪他人的助學金，當然，他們是極度的盼望有個半工半讀的機會的。</p>
<p>至於晚間的工作向那兒去找呢？</p>
<p>這裏我希望有子北的公館能聘請一個大學生在晚上，或在星期六和日補習他們的子弟。薪俸每半年一發，那莫非但可以或就他們的學業，還養成他的獨立奮關的精神</p>
<p>憑着一年來課餘的家庭敎師的經騐，我深切地覺得學校敎育的不够。我並不是說應該廢止學校敎育，我的意思就是送孩子入學校外還須替他們補習。</p>
<p>我所敎導的幾個小孩中的一個。看看他校中的算術練習簿，裏面差不多都是一百分。也許是由於好奇心，我將其中他所演算過的幾問算術，命他重做一遍。結果害得他對白紙呆望了半個鐘頭，經過我再三的探詢，才知道他每决都是抄襲旁座的人的。這種情形在學校並不少，可是假使個小孩進了學校後，從初小開始抄起，一直抄到高小六年級爲止。哈，畢業了！試想，他究竟得到一些什麼呢？這現象非但小學，中學大學也然，凡是過來人大約部知道的吧！</p>
<p>假使你有個弟妹，或則兒女們在學校中讀書的，不妨在空閒時拿他們的書來問問他們看，結果會使你很失望的。嚴厲的問他們，在校中爲什麽不聽。個說：「前面兩個人一天到晚的講閒話，先生敎書聽也聽不出。」</p>
<p>一個說：「學校中的先生，敎書太快，我去拾一張紙頭，等到回來已經一大段跳過了。」</p>
<p>在天眞無瑕的小心中，或許這是事實。不過，這能怪敎師嗎，全級四五十個人，每個全般顧及，那是不麻煩死人嗎？所以的確需要替他們在家中溫習。可是做父親的在晚上很疲倦的同來，那裏能够敎他們。母親爲了家務事煩惱着，那裏有這閒心思，所以還是讓大學生或高中學生在課餘來執行這任傷中！</p>
<p>你或許想學校中教了，家中再敎，豈不是多餘的嗎？是的，假使那孩子是非常非常聰明的話，但是一個平常的孩子，一遍或二遍的敎書，他只能領略一半，那恐怕他還是用心的聽呢。要使他達到一旦豁然貫通的境地，那非要五六遍不可。並且二個人敎一本書，可以使學生兼得他們的畏處。譬如以前我讀塊肉餘生時，敎師有二人一位是我所佩服的謝先生，另一位是校長，一個英國的紳士。謝先生替我們詳細的解釋，校長卻有純粹英國調的讀音，他還常常告訴我們央國的風俗習慣。我覺得謝先生敎我們那校長所不會敎的，可是校長敎我們謝先生所想不到的。所以有兩個人敎，遠較任何的一人勝得多呢。（稿酬贈助學金）</p>

<h3>「花瓶」應聘記  茵子</h3>
<p>上月十三我在萬分巴望中，居然收到一封通知信。我把牠拆開看過之後，眞的，那時我歡喜極了。我私下忖度半年來的失業是得救了。原來某公司徵求女司賬，我是微倖地被錄取了。但回想在面試的那天，我是何等的提心弔膽呀！</p>
<p>信上通知我十五號進公司服務。</p>
<p>進公司那天，我由前幾天面試的那位副理夏先生的介紹，認識了經理王先生。他是瘦長而滑稽的三十開外男子，當下他對我在五十多個女應徵者中而被錄取表示十分欽佩；並對我的英日文字及中外賬務的來得更表頌揚。</p>
<p>「蜜斯余，我們得到像你這樣一個有天才的司賬，眞是我們的幸運啊！噯……這在營業上的確有很大發展的，你說對嗎？」</p>
<p>從此他便老是蜜期長蜜斯短地旋着我。二三天後的晚上，公司剛打烊時，他走來問我大光明看電影去嗎。當時我借故推却了。第二天，不知怎的，他忽然買了什麼香水啦，脂粉啦，寇丹啦等來預備送給我。我很奇怪：他這是什麼意思！我說：「王先生，謝謝你的好意，我是不用這些的。請收回送給你的太太去用吧！」</p>
<p>「哈哈」他笑了。「蜜斯余，你還不知道我還沒有女人啦……」</p>
<p>但結果我沒有接受他的「禮物」。不過以後我想在工作上與人格上來影響這位經理，想把他的人格提高，不要那樣無聊。可是，沒等數天，他竟又要我到××舞廳去跳舞；但我却嚴辭地拒絕他：我們決不可在這種情形下談愛的。我又說：「旣然你愛我，難道我們不能在事業上先結起愛來嗎？」其實這是我在窘困下敷衍他而不得不這樣說的。</p>
<p>突然在三十一號那天，那位副理夏先生却對我說：「余小姐，我們感覺很抱歉，就是昨天有一筆賬你弄錯了，這顯然是你的疏忽。因此，王先生的意思是……噢…其實經理說你冷淡得太不會交際了……這里是你半個月的工錢，十五塊……明天你可不必來了。」（却酬）</p>

<p>打醮，誰都知道是一種迷信的舉動。可是每年每個里弄始終有這種儀式，不過規模略有大小吧了。它舉辦的來由，有的或許是目願助金，有的是被里弄中的特殊份子打秋風所致的，至於打醮對於滅疫到底有沒有功勞，我們有知識者現在似乎也太舌焦脣敝了。</p>
<p>單以打醮所耗的人力，物力，財力，巳很覺驚人，如果它確有人事之功，那末這些所消耗的錢財人力，還有點値得。你們看：孤島上不是每年有上很多人，仍爲疫病而死的嗎？時疫醫院不是門庭若市嗎？人事還不曾盡，何必去事鬼呢？</p>
<p>孤島上的朋友們！你們難道還不覺得生活程度的高漲嗎？你們爲何還要消耗這許多金錢呢？你們爲何不將這些金錢來做些「人事」呢？</p>

<h3>Chinese Military Delegation Arrives in Soviet Capital; Sino-Soviet Leaders Fu and Chiang to Meet; Moscow Tripartite Conference to Be Held Soon; US and UK to Be Represented by Wallace and Eden</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Labor Daily" on Sunday claimed that General Chiang Kai-shek will soon travel to Moscow to discuss military issues with Red Army leaders. This will be the first official meeting between Chiang and Stalin. A Chinese military delegation has now arrived in Moscow. It is rumored that any threatening actions by Japan against the Soviet Union will be met with a Sino-Soviet mutual assistance response. The joining of the Red Army and the Chinese army will form a pincer movement against Japan. At the same time, the last of the four different peace conditions proposed by Tokyo has been rejected by General Chiang Kai-shek. Japan clearly wants to keep China out of the Far Eastern war before it breaks out. The correspondent also said that although the burden on the Soviet Union's wartime industry is currently very heavy, the supply of munitions and aircraft to China has not stopped or decreased.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 17th. The "Sunday Pictorial" today carried an unconfirmed report stating that British Prime Minister Churchill may meet with Stalin for a conference, similar to his talks with President Roosevelt at sea. The "Reynolds News" strongly suggests that General Chiang Kai-shek will soon depart for Moscow to discuss the Far Eastern situation with Red Army leaders, indicating the possibility of a mutual assistance agreement between China and the Soviet Union directed at Japan.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th. On the 15th, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union called on Stalin to present him with a joint telegram from President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill regarding Anglo-American preparations to assist the Soviet Union in fighting Germany. Stalin, on behalf of the Soviet government, requested the British and American ambassadors to convey his thanks to President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. As for Roosevelt and Churchill's suggestion to hold a conference in Moscow to discuss the allocation of raw materials and munitions, Stalin also welcomed it, and said that he would take all steps to ensure that the tripartite conference could be held as soon as possible. Molotov was also present when Stalin received the British and American ambassadors.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 16th. According to local newspapers, representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to hold a conference in Moscow in early September, which will be personally presided over by Stalin. The United States will be represented by Vice President Wallace, and the British representative is said to be Foreign Secretary Eden.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 17th. Since Stalin accepted the joint invitation from President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, it is expected that an important conference to establish a strong alliance between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to resist Nazism will be convened in Moscow in a few days. When accepting the invitation yesterday, Stalin told the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union, "We are now trying to arrange for the conference to be held as soon as possible." In their joint communiqué to Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill stated that the main goal of the conference was the distribution of military equipment and raw materials. Soviet diplomatic circles predict that the main result of the Anglo-American-Soviet conference will be the establishment of a "warehouse" for the three countries' military supplies. At the same time, according to news from London, the head of the British delegation to the Soviet Union will be either British Foreign Secretary Eden or British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook, while Hopkins will represent the United States at the conference. After receiving the communiqué from Roosevelt and Churchill, Stalin requested the British and American ministers to convey the Soviet Union's sincere gratitude to their leaders for the aid that the United Kingdom and the United States would provide in the Soviet Union's liberation war against Hitlerism. Roosevelt and Churchill's communiqué stated, "Further battles on other fronts have not yet begun." This phrase implicitly suggests that the United Kingdom may soon launch an attack on continental Europe, in order to force Germany to withdraw its troops from the Eastern Front. All sectors of Soviet society are very interested in this phrase.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 17th. Diplomatic circles here predict that the upcoming Anglo-American-Soviet tripartite conference in Moscow has three objectives: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States want to work to bring the Soviet Union into a new order of democratic countries; (2) The United Kingdom and the United States want to ascertain the strategic position of the Soviet army in the war against Germany and to inform Stalin that British military advisors may assist the Soviet General Staff; (3) The United Kingdom and the United States want to obtain assurances that, regardless of developments on the Western Front, the Soviet Far Eastern Army will remain stationed in Siberia to contain Japan. It is believed that the extent of Stalin's cooperation on a good world order will depend on the extent of Anglo-American aid to the Soviet Union in this war. At the same time, it is rumored that Washington and London are eager to know the true position of the Soviet army on the Western Front.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Arrive in Indochina Non-Stop, Reaching 80,000 to 100,000</p>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 17th. The second batch of Japanese troops almost reached Cape Saint Jacques last night, and are scheduled to begin landing in Saigon today. Kun is stationed in Vietnam as the overall commander. The leader of the Japanese mission, Sumida, returned to Hanoi yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 17th. Thirty British expatriates arrived here yesterday from Saigon on a French ship, describing the situation of Japanese troops entering Vietnam non-stop. They said that there were already 80,000 to 100,000 Japanese soldiers in Vietnam, but their equipment seemed sufficient for 160,000 troops. A neutral observer said that the general French population is completely pro-British, hoping that the British will win, as this is the only hope to prevent Vietnam from becoming a Japanese colony.</p>
<h3>Overall Review of the World Situation; UK and US Reach Full Understanding; President Roosevelt Announces Progress of the Conference; Says the US Is Not Closer to Entering the War as a Result</h3>
<p>United Press, Rockland, Maine, 17th. President Roosevelt said yesterday that during the recent historic maritime conference with British Prime Minister Churchill, when drafting the procedures for postwar peace goals, the UK and US established a full understanding of the situation in major continents of the world. President Roosevelt said that the United States is not closer to entering the war than before. He made the remarks at a press conference held yesterday after disembarking from the yacht "Potomac." President Roosevelt stated that his current plan assumes that the Soviet Union is still at war with the Nazis in the spring of next year. He said that the Soviet Union was not invited to participate in the eight principles of the Anglo-American declaration, and that he knew nothing about any plans to invite the Soviet Union to participate. He said that the Soviet Union's needs include two categories. The first is readily available raw materials to aid in the summer war, and the second need is based on the assumption that the winter war will be half-stalled. This need includes raw materials that can be obtained for the spring war next year. President Roosevelt said that when he and Prime Minister Churchill met, officials of equal rank from the UK and the US held multiple meetings. He declined to disclose the location of the conference or how long it lasted, saying that the reason for keeping this secret was very clear. President Roosevelt pointed out that the first positive development was to request Congress to draft a new budget of several trillion dollars to supplement the original 70 billion lend-lease funds. He said that this request in Congress was currently under study. President Roosevelt said that the Anglo-American understanding was complete on all aspects of the world situation, implying that the United States and the United Kingdom have united in an agreement to facilitate the two countries' actions in dealing with any contingency. The President said that when he and Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting on the former Asian Fleet flagship "Augusta" and the British battleship "Prince of Wales," they discussed all continents. He said that only one meeting was held on the "Augusta." When a reporter asked, "Do you think we are closer to entering the war?" President Roosevelt immediately replied that he did not think that the United States was close to actual participation in the war. He refused to allow newspaper reporters to directly quote the above answer. President Roosevelt said that his exchange of views with Prime Minister Churchill mostly involved the present and the future. He made it clear that his joint actions with the British Prime Minister were to deal with events occurring in any part of the world, but he had no indication whatsoever that the United States' cooperation would be more direct than before, that is, as a munitions factory for democratic countries. Regarding the French political situation, he said that he was unable to understand its inner workings due to a lack of information. Once he returned to Washington, he would discuss the matter with Secretary of State Hull, and would also consult with the Secretary of State on the recent developments in the Far East. He had previously announced that he hoped to meet with the Duke of Kent at Hyde Park next week. President Roosevelt expressed Britain and Churchill's determination to defeat the Nazi regime at any cost. He said that many commentators have ignored the need for the United Kingdom and the United States to exchange views on the world situation as the Nazis invade more countries. He declared that the more this issue is explored, the more terrifying the idea of the Nazis seizing more countries becomes. President Roosevelt said that all democratic countries should carefully explore this issue. President Roosevelt declared that the delegation included General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General Arnold, Minister of the Air Force of the Army, Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, Major General King, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, Under Secretary of State Welles, Harriman, and the President's private attendants. President Roosevelt declared that the Soviet Union did not receive aid under the lend-lease program because the Soviet Union had cash to pay for war materials. The President left the yacht at 4 p.m. and took a special car to Washington. All the streets from the river bank to the station were decorated with flags to welcome him, and the viewers were like walls. Colonel Starling, the White House guard captain, led many secret detectives to Rockland before the yacht arrived to carry out security. Local military and police also took on security work along the President's route.</p>
<p>Motivation for the Conference, Reuters, Rockland, 17th. President Roosevelt said that the motivation for his conference with the British Prime Minister began in February of this year, with the goal of joint planning. Later, the date of the conference was delayed by three months due to the wars in Greece and Crete. He believes that both the joint declaration and the criticisms of the declaration ignore one thing, and that is the need to exchange views on the situation in various places under Nazi rule. The more the situation in the occupied areas or Nazi-controlled areas is studied, the more terrifying it feels to have this power in the area.</p>
<p>Prayers on Board the Ship. The President mentioned that Churchill held a prayer on the battleship "Prince of Wales" on August 10, saying that all those who participated in the worship felt that this was an important prayer of historical significance. The prayer ceremony was presided over by one British and one American priest.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Whereabouts. It was also said that he and Churchill consulted for more than one day, which was very effective in exchanging information in the present and the future. As for Churchill's whereabouts, the President refused to announce it, only saying that to his knowledge, the British Prime Minister did not intend to visit the United States, and he himself did not intend to visit the United Kingdom at this time. President Roosevelt was energetic, calm, and smoking a cigarette when he received the reporters. He smiled and greeted each reporter who entered the reception room. After the reception, the President disembarked, and the audience cheered loudly. Then he went to the station and took a special train to Washington. All the streets from the river bank to the station were decorated with flags to welcome him, and the viewers were like walls. Colonel Starling, the White House guard captain, led many secret detectives to Rockland before the yacht arrived to carry out security. Local military and police also took on security work along the President's route.</p>
<h3>UK and US Plan to Send Troops to Defend the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 17th. Informed sources here, in view of Japan's plan to attack the Soviet Far Eastern Army and the deteriorating relations between Chongqing and Vichy, expect that there will soon be a decisive battle in the Pacific. According to Chinese sources, the United Kingdom and the United States are currently making active plans to help China defend the road through Burma in order to prevent the Japanese from cutting off China's lifeline. It is rumored that the United Kingdom has begun to build eight new air force bases in Burma, and is building three new roads in northern Burma, so that when Japanese planes attack the railway between Yangon and Kunming, traffic to China can be maintained. The Chinese believe that although the Japanese continue to put pressure on Thailand, their main goal is still to attack the Soviet Union. The reason why they are currently active in Vietnam and Thailand is nothing more than to prevent British and American intervention. If Japan wants to wage a large-scale war in Southeast Asia, it must have at least 200,000 troops, but there are only 50,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam today.</p>
<h3>The Future of US-Japan Relations Depends on Japanese Actions</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th. "Scripps-Howard" newspaper commentator Danny said yesterday that due to the Nazis' advance in Soviet territory and the arrival of American aid to the Soviet Union in the Far West Siberia, the danger of a US-Japan war will reach a new peak within two weeks. Denny said that unless Japan can preemptively prevent American aid from reaching the Soviet Union in an effective way, the Soviet Union will become one of the members of the Sino-British-American-Dutch anti-Japanese defense alliance in the Far East. He also said that the bombers of the Soviet Union in Vladivostok are the planes closest to Japan in the world. Denny also said that the events of the past three days have temporarily calmed the Pacific, and the military leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States have greater confidence. It is because Japan is now rapidly losing its initiative in the military. But he also said that what is needed is to speed up precautions because of the spirit of the samurai and the overall plan for the future.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th. When Secretary of State Hull received reporters yesterday, he declined to comment on the rumor from London that the United States would protect the Pacific after the Roosevelt-Churchill conference. Hull said that he has repeatedly issued warnings, pointing out the dangers facing the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, because some places in South America, especially areas that produce excess raw materials, may be invaded. When a reporter asked what efforts the United States and other American republics are currently making to resist Nazi activities in the Americas, Hull replied that nothing could be disclosed about those who are currently doing their best to conquer the world.</p>
<h3>Japan Refuses US Ship to Sail to Japan to Transport US Citizens Back Home; Coolidge Ordered to Sail Directly to San Francisco; Both Parties Are Negotiating Exchange of Evacuees</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th. The State Department announced yesterday that Japan had refused the American ship "President Coolidge" to sail to the Japanese coast to transport 100 American citizens away from Japan to return home. Japanese observers said that the reason why Japan refused the American ship to transport American citizens back to the United States was obviously to use them as hostages, on the one hand to guarantee the departure of Japanese citizens from the United States, and on the other hand to guarantee better treatment for Japanese ships in American ports. According to reports, these 100 American citizens originally intended to take a Japanese ship back home, but the trip was canceled. The State Department formally announced that the reason why the State Department originally sent the "President Coolidge" to Japan to evacuate American citizens after leaving Shanghai last Thursday was because the original Pan Pacific route to Japan had been canceled. The US Embassy in Tokyo contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry, but the Foreign Ministry only allowed the "President Coolidge" to carry 20 American officials back to the United States, but was not allowed to carry American citizens. Washington then ordered the ship to sail directly to San Francisco.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th. The "Asahi Shimbun" reported today from San Francisco that Japanese Consul General Muto received instructions from Japanese Ambassador Nomura and has gone to Washington to discuss dispatching a special ship to the United States to evacuate Japanese citizens residing in the United States. At the same time, Japan today allowed several American ships to sail from Japan to Shanghai.</p>

Filipinos have not given up their ultimate goal, but this issue is no longer in the hands of Filipinos or others. If the result of this war is to guarantee the rights of small countries, then the Philippines will definitely be independent. If we are a small country relying on the breath of big countries, Filipinos can only bid farewell to independence. We are a democratic country, we trust democratic life, so we share life and death with the United States. Quezon also spoke about the next presidential election, saying that he was nominated as a candidate for president, saying that if elected, he would serve the country, but he did not want to campaign.</p>

<p>Mexico Prepares to Restore Diplomatic Relations with the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Reuters, Mexico City, 17th.</p>
<p>The Mexican Senate recently passed a resolution by a majority to urge the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Mexico. The diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Mexico were severed in May 1938 due to the Mexican government's confiscation of British oil fields in Mexico.</p>

<h3>Japan Speculates That UK and US Are Using Intermediaries to Induce Japan to Distance Itself from the Axis; The Anti-Aggression Camp Is Gradually Expanding; Japan Cannot Hide Its Anxious Emotions</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th. Political observers here said yesterday that they believe the Roosevelt-Churchill peace goals declaration is intended to induce Japan and small European countries to separate from Germany. They said that Japan must not allow itself to fall into the trap of the United Kingdom and the United States, but should continue to implement its "established policy." Political commentators said that the maritime conference convened by the British and American leaders must have established some secret military understandings, otherwise there would be no need for naval and military experts to attend the meeting. It was also said that this declaration was an "empty, pleasant, clever, and cunning action" so that Central America could use it to cope with future developments. The "Japan Wide News" said that this decisive meeting may attempt to deal with Hitler's peace offensive because the German peace appeal, if it reaches the ears of the British and American people before the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration, may have an important reaction. The newspaper also said that Japan has the same goals as Roosevelt and Churchill, but it is doubtful whether Japan will still have freedom of the high seas without a navy. The commentary said that the document was an "Atlantic appeal" meaning that it has nothing to do with Japan.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th. Japanese newspapers today paid close attention to the meeting to be held in Moscow by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and predicted that the three countries would plan military strategies to deal with Japan and Germany. The newspapers said that this meeting shows Moscow's dependence on anti-Axis forces, which is very important for Japan because the Soviet Union will be responsible for delivering supplies to anti-Axis countries. The "National News" said that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union, the war may spread to the Far East, Stalin may abandon the Soviet Union in Europe and consolidate his position in Siberia, and then attack Japan. The newspaper said that if the current military and industrial plan in Siberia is completed, Japan will no longer be able to occupy it alone. The newspaper also strongly advocated the abundance of mining in Siberia. The "Hochi Shimbun" said that Japan's resource allocation plan will have a considerable impact on Japan-Soviet relations, and said that the Soviet Union has followed the British into a trap and dug its own grave. The newspaper also said that if Moscow participates in the opposition to the Axis powers, resulting in a break in Japan-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility. The newspaper also urged the Soviet Union to consider its position.</p>
<p>United Press, St. Peter, 17th. The American oil tanker "Claral" sailed yesterday with 95,000 gallons of aircraft fuel to Vladivostok. This is one of the four oil tankers received by the Shipping Board to transport oil to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Eight Principles and Fourteen Points</h3>
<p>Regarding the objective of this war extending to the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa, the aggressor has already openly stated that it is to establish a so-called "new order." In other words, it is to ensure the political and economic leadership and control of these countries in regions far larger than their own territories. On the other hand, the democratic countries have a very clear stance on destroying aggression and violence and preserving the independence and freedom of the invaded countries, but they have always lacked an overall plan. During this time, the US President has repeatedly declared his important beliefs in his fireside chats, and Churchill and Eden have also repeatedly explained the war objectives of Britain, but they have not yet been formulated into general principles. It is still a long way to the end of the war. To talk about a post-war plan may be a bit premature, but the so-called post-war plan is actually the ultimate goal of the war. In order to strengthen war confidence and promote the realization of victory, this issue should never be allowed to form a major mystery in the minds of the world for a long time.</p>
<p>Now this shortcoming has been compensated for after the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. Naturally, the eight principles and that declaration announced by the British side on the 14th are not the only achievements of the meeting. Perhaps the most important thing for all parties is the various steps that are strictly guarded to deal with the crisis in Europe and Asia. But it is absolutely not allowed to ignore the important meaning of this more abstract peace plan. What has plunged the international situation into today's chaos and darkness is undoubtedly one of the important reasons is the solutions after the previous Great War. Some unfortunate events in the past 20 years should be traced back to the Paris Peace Conference, and the United States itself did not participate in the League of Nations advocated by President Wilson, which made the political organization for resolving international disputes doomed to failure and decline from the day it was established. Therefore, if the world does not want to repeat the previous mistakes and make the future world gradually approach the ideal state, then this post-war plan must be paid attention to first.</p>
<p>Among the eight principles this time, the first three elaborate on the political stance and aspirations of Britain and the United States; the middle three express the ideals in the economic aspect; the seventh reiterates the United States' traditional policy of freedom of the seas; and the eighth opposes the use of force and emphasizes the disarmament of aggressor countries. Although there are only general principles here, with many details, and how to implement them concretely still needs more meticulous and detailed discussion, all the biggest problems and disputes in the international community today have been put forward with correct solutions, drawing a succinct outline for the democratic countries' broad and profound ideal beliefs about the future of the world. Under such a goal, it is expected that it will be able to exert greater combat power and make the situation clear as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The disclosure of the eight principles this time naturally reminds people of the fourteen points announced by President Wilson in 1918. What must be explained here is that although the spirit of the two has some common points, this time it is by no means a restatement of the fourteen points, and I believe it will not repeat Wilson's failure. First, the fourteen points were Wilson's personal beliefs formed with the assistance of some experts. Even in the United States, they failed to gain unanimous support from the country. Therefore, although they were generally welcomed by the world at the time, they always lacked binding force; but the eight principles this time are the conclusions reached by the agreement between the British and American authorities, and at the same time, they are the promotion of national policy and the clarification of steps. Second, most of Wilson's propositions were limited to political issues. There are very few achievements in the more basic economic aspect, and the organization of the League of Nations also failed because it did not consider the economic foundation and forced countries with conflicting economic interests to cooperate politically. This time, special efforts have been made in the economic aspect, and Article 4 states that all countries, regardless of size, strength, or whether they win or lose, can enjoy the trade and raw materials necessary for their economic prosperity on equal terms. The fifth item states that it will promote full cooperation among countries in the economic aspect, and the sixth item hopes that after defeating the Nazis, all countries will be able to live and work in peace within their borders. This will not only make the aggressors who use "dissatisfaction" as an excuse lose their theoretical basis, but also is a necessary way to promote true peace and stability in the world. Third, among the fourteen points, in addition to Article 6 to Article 13, which separately stated the handling of the postwar territorial sovereignty and other issues of the warring countries on both sides of Europe, there were few specific insights on how to eliminate world unrest and prevent future turmoil. Everything was entrusted to the League of Nations to solve. This joint declaration of Britain and the United States did not mention the League of Nations and its future, but if all the provisions can be implemented satisfactorily, the international future can be expected to be completely changed, and in the end it will not be difficult to promote more effective political cooperation among countries. We have no intention of belittling Wilson and his great aspirations, but there is no doubt that the declaration of Britain and the United States is more practical and concrete. This point is naturally related to the times, and it also proves that human reason and wisdom are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>The most important issue at present is naturally how to win the victory in the anti-aggression war, and at the same time, we should also consider how to make everything after the war be resolved reasonably. This is naturally still an arduous task, but judging from what has already been revealed, it can be asserted that the light will surely come, and it will certainly not repeat the mistakes of history.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Absolutely Supports the Joint Declaration of Britain and the United States, and the Democratic Front Is Becoming More Solid, With the Confidence to Defeat Nazi Dominance</h3>
<p>TASS Moscow, 17th – Regarding the joint declaration of Britain and the United States, the "Pravda" today commented, "In essence, the British-American declaration is full of strong determination to win victory over Hitler and destroy Nazism. All nations that love freedom and oppose the brutal Nazis will surely warmly welcome this declaration. The meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill has extremely important political significance. The talks between the leaders of Britain and the United States show that the cooperation between the two countries and all anti-Nazi countries is becoming more extensive and consolidated. The decisions made by Roosevelt and Churchill have given Hitler a new blow, and at the same time have increased Germany's isolation in the international community. The expansion of British-American cooperation has promoted the unity of anti-Hitler forces, which is of great importance. The conclusion of the Soviet-British military agreement and the Soviet-American economic agreement, as well as further cooperation between Britain and the United States, will enable us to complete the glorious task of liberating mankind from the threat of Hitler. Hitler is now against the three most powerful countries in the world, and these three major powers already have the cooperation of all people who love freedom and have suffered from fascist oppression. The further consolidation of the anti-Hitler democratic front has confirmed Stalin's words. Stalin once said, 'In this great war, we will gain loyal allies in Europe and the Americas (including the Germans oppressed by Hitler). Our war will be mixed with the struggle for independence and freedom in Europe and the Americas, and become a united front against the threat of Hitler.' The Soviet people absolutely support the joint declaration of British and American political leaders to strengthen the anti-Hitler struggle. After the declaration is issued, there should be more extensive and practical steps to destroy fascist aggressors and Nazi tyranny. The Soviet people deeply believe that the united strength of the people who love freedom will surely bring the war to a victorious end."</p>
<p>Chongqing Welcomes It – Reuters, Chongqing, 17th</p>
<p>The Central Daily News welcomes the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, saying that August 14, 1941, will be a memorial day for world peace and construction, because the closer and more determined cooperation between democratic countries will surely resolve the aggressor countries as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill: The Chinese government and people warmly welcome it. "President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's joint declaration, which lists the basic goals of resisting aggression, is not only a statement for democratic countries, but also expresses the wishes of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people for a truly new world order. Even among the people of the Axis countries, there must be many sympathizers. And the plan of this main point is deeply in line with the principles of the Kuomintang and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's idea of a world commonwealth. This is what China is pleased with. The construction of the post-war world is more difficult than winning the war. The restoration of the freedom of the conquered nations, the economic cooperation between countries, and the improvement of living standards, and the establishment of a permanent organization for overall security, all require the supreme efforts and firm political talents of the democratic countries and their leaders. China is prepared to bear its due responsibilities in this regard, just as it has spared no unprecedented sacrifices in manpower and material resources for more than four years to express its arduous obligations and has never slackened. China is convinced that the last elimination of world aggression forces, the shortcut is to strengthen the encirclement of the Far East, and first defeat Japan, and this kind of this encirclement structure, Japan is the only architect.

Peck was born in China and began his diplomatic career in 1906. Therefore, he said that he had witnessed the increasing growth of China's national power and had followed the Chinese government from Nanjing to Hankou, and then from Hankou to Chongqing. He has had many experiences of being bombed by Japanese planes.

His rise to prominence is due to his complete grasp of Far East issues. He will take a plane to Bangkok to take office." (16th telegram)</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 17th - The Department of Commerce briefly described the commercial situation in the United States yesterday, saying that the production of military supplies now occupies an important part of the country's total production, which shows the progress of the national defense program.

Reuters, New York, 17th - National Defense Petroleum Coordinator Harold L. Ickes said yesterday that the adequacy of gasoline supply can determine the victory of the overseas war. He believes that the US oil industry will be able to quickly double its oil refining capacity to fully supply the oil needed for aircraft. Oil industry representatives and Petroleum Administration officials met last week and have agreed on preliminary investigation methods. If the United States does not greatly increase its oil refining capacity, the United States will not be able to continue to build and use thousands of aircraft, and at the same time will not be able to supply the needs of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>

A total of 684 Japanese planes participated in the attack, of which 86 planes went to attack Chengdu and other places, and the rest dropped bombs in Chongqing and its suburbs. Most of the bombs fell in the new urban area, and both bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped. However, Chongqing's fire protection project has made progress, so although more than 20 fires broke out, no major disasters occurred. Only the Fuxing Flour Factory and the Yuhua Yarn Factory suffered slightly heavier losses, but they were also less than 400 yuan. Several hundred civilians were bombed to death, and the number of people who were slightly injured or seriously injured was double that. On the whole, the rescue process was satisfactory.

<h3>Four Years of Chinese Warfare: Unity Among Provinces, Determined to Repel Aggression and Rebuild China; People Now Have a Favorable Impression of Soldiers</h3>
<p>London - The Times reports that four years of war have brought about fundamental changes in China. One of the most significant lessons the Chinese have learned from their arduous struggles is that the salvation of the country lies solely in their own efforts. Another change is the wealth of the Chinese interior, where the central government is rapidly establishing a great fortress with industrial and transportation resources. A third historical change is the elimination of provincialism; the animosity between provinces has been replaced by a common unity, determined to first repel aggression and then rebuild China. In addition, the people's attitude towards soldiers has also changed. Those who once feared the army like snakes and scorpions now see it as the savior in the government. The Chinese are still fighting on the battlefield because they cannot accept the idea of defeat. Although the Japanese deny that China is fighting for democracy, the Chinese instinctively feel that their struggle is for the right to autonomy. This "awakening" has, as a result of the war, expanded to the world outside of China. It is no longer surprising to find schoolchildren or farmers in the Chinese interior expressing their opinions on China's place in the world war. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>American Writer Ernest Hemingway and Wife Enjoy Trip to Mountainous Defense Line (1)</h3>
<p>Famous American writer Ernest Hemingway and his wife traveled from Hong Kong to Shao this spring by plane, and then by car, horse, and boat, overcoming many difficulties to reach the front lines for inspection. They were deeply impressed by the strong morale of the Chinese. They described their inspection experience in detail via Pan-Pacific Radio Live and Collier's magazine. The photos were taken by the famous writer Ernest Hemingway, and the text was written by Hemingway's wife, Ms. Gellhorn.</p>
<p>Recent Photos of Ernest Hemingway and Wife</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Shao</p>
<p>We stepped onto the riverbank and ran through the mud. Near the front of a bamboo house, a small squad of soldiers stood in the rain. Facing the squad of soldiers were eight grooms, wearing large conical straw hats that could also be used as umbrellas, oilcloth coats, shorts, and straw sandals. They held the reins of seven horses; the eighth horse was originally a racehorse from Hong Kong. The soldiers, grooms, and horses were all shivering in the cold rain, and water dripped from their bodies into the soft, muddy ground.</p>
<p>After the rain-soaked troops saluted us, they mounted their horses and set off. The horse I was riding suddenly lost its temper, leaping like a child, knocking our interpreter down, who could only stand in the mud. The horses lost their tempers, the coolies hit the horses' noses, and whistled sharply. The horses let out a long neigh, trying to bite the grooms. We proceeded in single file along a slippery path. Each groom always ran in front of the horse. The movements of the eight horses were as turbulent as a steed in a gymnasium. The heavy rain soaked our clothes. The mountain stream suddenly seemed to swell in the rain, as if to wash away some of the dirty clothes here. We ran along the small path, lowered our heads to avoid the wet bushes, dodged low-hanging branches, and raised our legs to avoid getting wet as we forded the stream. The group moved quietly in the rain.</p>
<p>We were setting off for the front lines of a certain war zone. Five days ago, we arrived at the Hong Kong airport in the dark of night. We waited there for three hours for the weather to improve. Later, the weather report came, saying that planes could not take off in Nanxiong, because of thick clouds and poor visibility. Therefore, the flight was canceled. The next day, we took off in a sky covered with low clouds, and after an hour and a half, passing through towering mountains and the Japanese-occupied area, we landed in the mud in the rear of China. We managed to get a dilapidated car, and then we and five other Chinese people got into the car and meandered along a yellow dirt road, arriving at Shaoguan at dusk. The hotel where we stayed was called "Shaoguang." The rented room had a small lounge furnished with several bamboo chairs, a table, two kerosene lamps, and a spittoon. Behind it was a windowless bedroom with two beds. Further back, a small door led to the bathroom, which was equipped with a washbasin, a spittoon, and a mirror. We opened the bedspreads and mosquito nets (although it was cold now, there were still many mosquitoes, slow-flying mosquitoes with their hind legs curled up – a type of malarial mosquito). We were very happy to settle in this "palace."</p>
<p>The next day, the commander-in-chief of the war zone here invited us to lunch. He looked like a gentle and happy bodhisattva. We drank tea, bowed five times as customary, and chatted for a while in a dimly lit stone house. After this formal ceremony, we dined with the chief of staff and others. The dishes were sumptuous, with shark fin soup, preserved eggs, bamboo shoots, and steamed buns. Even in the army, where drinking alcohol was strictly prohibited, some wine was always prepared for guests. So the commander-in-chief and several officers toasted everyone one by one. When we drank wine, we wished the two great leaders of China and the United States, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Roosevelt, good health and wished us a smooth journey.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief drank many glasses of wine and sweated profusely, and two officers also had flushed faces. The interpreter was also drunk, and Hemingway was very happy to say when toasting the final victory of the Chinese army, stuttering and unable to say a word. Because the taste of the wine was strong, I should have emptied my glass, but I only sipped half of it. Hemingway drank heartily and without restraint, which saved us a lot of face. Later, the commander-in-chief said in Chinese that the wine jars were empty. The drinking contest finally ended. Everyone laughed heartily, and the banquet ended in joy. (To be continued) The author took a photo on the foothills of the front lines, from left to right, the author of this article, Ms. Hemingway's wife Gu'erhang, interpreter Ma, Hemingway, and two soldiers.</p>

<h3>The War on the Soviet Fronts Has Reached Its Most Intense Stage; Germany is Trying its Utmost to Achieve Victory Before the Cold Season; Nikolaev Reportedly Occupied by Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - The large-scale war in southern Ukraine is still underway. The situation there is quite unclear. Neither side's communiqués yesterday revealed the truth. However, the army under the command of Soviet General Butny is still able to fight back bravely, which shows that the victories boasted by the Germans in the past few days are not entirely credible. Because the general's subordinates still maintain their ability to fight, unlike what the Germans said about their rout. Yesterday, the German war report on Ukraine did not mention any place names, only saying that the war in the east is proceeding smoothly according to plan. The land lost by the Soviets in Ukraine has industrial and agricultural value, which cannot be ignored. But how much of a price has Germany really paid? According to the disclosures in the German newspapers in the past three days, one general, five battalion commanders, seventeen artillery captains, and twenty-nine detachments have died. These numbers are of course only a small part of the total number of deaths. However, the heavy losses of the German army can also be seen from this. In some places, the German army seems to have been forced to abandon the old trick of densely charging into the Soviet positions with a large number of tanks, and has resumed the old method of tanks, infantry, and artillery supporting each other, because the tank squadrons lost contact with the support after going deep alone, resulting in many losses. Germany started its offensive against the Soviet Union with 170 divisions, including 60 mobile mechanized divisions, and tank troops accounted for 26 divisions. According to Soviet estimates, no less than 15 of these 60 divisions have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Lei, said that the Soviet communiqué on Friday night mentioned fierce fighting along the entire line, but did not specify areas or locations, only saying that it has now reached one of the most intense scenes in the war. Soviet newspapers said yesterday that fierce battles were launched on not only one front, which shows that Hitler wants to use all his strength to achieve victory before the cold season arrives. Moscow had a very weak air raid yesterday morning after two days without alerts. This shows that German aircraft are busy on the battlefield. Hitler's alleged personal command on the Eastern Front further indicates the importance Germany attaches to the current war. The most attention is paid to the Ukrainian front. According to war reports from yesterday afternoon, the war on Friday night was extremely tenacious. The Smolensk position is slightly stabilized. The Germans are remembered for digging trenches there to consolidate themselves. Their main force is advancing fiercely towards the Soviet industrial areas and transportation lines, not only wanting to hinder Soviet supplies, but also to disrupt the Soviet economic life. The Germans are eager to cut off the Nikolaev area, obviously wanting to seize the grain stored there, and because the area has important naval shipyards. There is currently no clear evidence that the German army has invaded the iron industry area in the Nikolaev Bay. It is expected that the Soviet army will definitely defend the iron industry area after abandoning the western Ukrainian agricultural area. Responsible Soviet officials have not said that a large number of Soviet soldiers have been captured, which shows that the Soviet retreat is well-organized. The Germans also planned to invade the railway from Moscow to Leningrad, but have not yet succeeded. It will be known in a few days whether the German army has extended its transportation lines and needs a little time to rest. Guerrilla warfare is still in progress, especially in the northwest, because the northwest has more forests, which is more conducive to guerrilla warfare than plains.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - The Soviet Information Bureau issued the following war report: "On the 16th, fierce fighting took place on the entire Soviet-German front. The fighting in the south was particularly fierce. Our air force inflicted heavy blows on the enemy."</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - On the night of the 15th, the Soviet Air Force once again attacked Berlin and the Stettin area, dropping incendiary and high-explosive bombs on military and industrial targets, causing large fires. All Soviet aircraft returned safely to their defenses.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 17th - The General Command announced this morning that the German and Hungarian allied forces have already occupied the Soviet Black Sea port of Nikolaev, which is located about 100 miles northeast of the port of Odessa.</p>
<h3>Germany Declares Relentless Bombing of Retreating Soviet Troops</h3>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 17th - Authoritative German sources said yesterday that the massive Soviet war has reached the end of its eighth week. Soviet Marshal Butny is now exhausting his available troops in an attempt to establish a new defense line east of the Dnieper River. This defense line includes the industrial area of the Donets Basin east of Ukraine. At the same time, according to German sources, the Red Army is making every effort to withdraw the remaining troops from western Ukraine, while the Germans are relentlessly and continuously bombing the Soviet troops surrounded in the "pocket" on the Dnieper River bridges in an effort to prevent their retreat. It is also said that the German air force is also assisting in the continuous bombing of troop carriers attempting to withdraw a portion of the Soviet troops from Odessa and Nikolaev. The German News Agency said that on Friday, the German army had encircled the strong Soviet troops in southern Ukraine in a new encirclement. The exact number of Soviet losses in manpower and materials in the area is currently unknown. It also said that in another area of the same front, the Soviet army suffered heavy losses and twenty people were captured, and six cannons, fourteen flat-shooting cannons, and four infantry cannons were lost.</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Attack on Leningrad; Ukraine Also in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 17th - According to news from Berlin, the German offensive against Leningrad is intensifying, especially in the northeast. Military sources say that the entire territory of Ukraine between the Dnieper River and the Black Sea has multiple Soviet troops surrounded, but the surrounded area is quite large, so the Soviet troops can still move freely. According to Norwegian news, railway transportation is greatly restricted to carry German wounded soldiers from northern Finland exclusively.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 17th - A German military spokesman announced last night that German armored units and mechanized units launched a new offensive in the central region yesterday, continuing the lightning strikes that advanced approximately 225 to 300 miles in Ukraine over the past week, and advanced towards the Soviets. According to the Germans, the battle of Ukraine is advancing in a three-pronged formation, attempting to break through the large pocket positions of Marshal Butny's army. It is reported that the army of a certain formation is partly composed of Romanian troops, advancing south along the Dniester River, threatening Odessa. The second formation is advancing south along the Bug River from the direction of Uman, threatening Nikolaev on the Black Sea. The third advance is advancing southeast from Uman. According to the German claim, it has occupied the iron ore area of ​​Krivoy Rog, which has clearly threatened Dnepropetrovsk. The German spokesman said that each road has advanced more than 250 miles in the past week, and he believes that the position of Marshal Butny's army is extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>Britain Uses Flying Fortresses to Bomb Brest; British and German Aircraft Bomb Each Other Fiercely</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 17th - The Flying Fortresses shipped from the United States bombed the Brest dockyards again yesterday morning, and the British Air Force also flew to the coastal areas of French territory across the Strait yesterday during the day. Authoritative sources said that as a result of the air battle, 19 enemy aircraft were shot down, and four British aircraft were also missing.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 17th - British and German aircraft formations bombed each other fiercely yesterday. According to the United Press correspondent in Folkestone, the British Air Force raided the German-occupied areas of Europe yesterday, lasting all afternoon. Countless bombers and fighters participated in the bombing. In addition to bombing northern France, they also flew over the North Sea. On Tuesday, the British and German Air Force, together with the Flying Fortresses, made a fierce daylight raid on Cologne across the North Sea. An official communiqué stated that a small number of German aircraft arrived on the British coast on Friday evening and made sporadic air raids. One or two aircraft flew inland, causing minor losses in northwestern England, East Anglia, and eastern Scotland, and some deaths and injuries in some places.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Attack German Convoy; Dutch Submarines Cooperate with Britain to Sink Axis Ships</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 17th - The Middle East Air Force Command issued a communiqué last night saying that on Friday, the British naval air force attacked an enemy convoy in the Mediterranean and achieved great success. Five enemy ships were escorted by several destroyers. When the British aircraft attacked, three enemy ships and one destroyer were hit by torpedoes. One of them, loaded with 6,000 tons, exploded instantly. Another ship, loaded with about 3,000 tons, was also hit and leaned to one side. It is estimated that these two ships and one destroyer have sunk, because according to reconnaissance aircraft reports, only three merchant ships were seen entering the port of Tripoli.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 17th - The Dutch official news agency said yesterday that a Dutch submarine, in cooperation with the British Navy, sank an enemy supply ship of 5,000 tons in the Mediterranean, and also sank an enemy liner of approximately 1,000 tons. It also said that Dutch submarines have recently destroyed 26,000 tons of enemy ships.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - The Ministry of Aviation announced today that last night British aircraft bombed the Rhineland and Ruhr in bad weather. The main targets were the docks of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Rotterdam, and Ostend, which were also attacked by British aircraft. Thirteen aircraft were missing. One German fighter was also shot down by a British bomber.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Warn the Iranian Government Again</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - According to sources here, the British and Soviet envoys to Iran have once again drawn the Iranian government's attention to the fact that the British and Soviet governments are very concerned about the excessive number of Germans in Iranian territory. They fear that the Iranian government does not have a proper understanding of the importance of this issue, so they suggest again that effective measures should be taken as soon as possible to eliminate the crisis hidden by the activities of these Germans.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Germany Ordered the Arrest of the Romanian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>International News Agency, New York, 17th - Yesterday, Moscow Radio reported that Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu has been ordered to be imprisoned by the German High Command.</p>
<h3>Turkish Government Allows Italian Oil Tanker to Pass Through the Straits</h3>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 17th - Authoritative sources revealed yesterday that the Turkish Navy and port authorities will release the Italian oil tanker "Dari Viso". It is expected that the ship will soon pass through the Dardanelles to Constanta. The Turkish government guarantees that it will not give the Italian oil tanker any facilities, and will not allow ships belonging to any country's navy when the war began to pass through the Dardanelles in the future. The British said that the "Dari Viso" was previously listed as a warship, but has recently changed, apparently in an attempt to obtain passage through the Dardanelles.</p>
<h3>The United States Uses a Huge Amount of Funds from the Lend-Lease Act to Send a Medical Team to China Because Workers Building the Yunnan-Burma Railway Need Good Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th - Reliable sources announced yesterday that the United States is now preparing to send a medical team of 16 people to China to be in charge of the health and treatment of 250,000 coolies building a new railway in Yunnan, Burma, Xufu, and China. This railway is parallel to the Burma Road and will be another major route for the Chinese. Well-informed sources said that the government will use $1,150,000 from the Lend-Lease Act for the expenses of this group, which is expected to be named the "Yunnan-Burma Railway Medical Team". The team will set up 50 camps and 16 hospitals. The team members will leave the United States this autumn and will be stationed in China for one year. It is known that the British government is building the part of the railway on the Burmese border, and the Chinese are building the part of the railway in Xufu on the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>Memories of Visiting Tagore (4)</h3>
<p>— Xu Baoqian</p>
<p>Tagore's works are numerous, and he became famous early in his life. He used Bengali exclusively for his writing, and only began writing in English at the age of fifty, and his hand-translated Gitanjali became famous throughout the universe. Tagore's English literary works include:</p>
<p>International University</p>
<p>Shantiniketan was originally a wasteland, a place where thieves roamed. One day in 1863, Tagore's father came here and was suddenly moved, uttering a prayer: "It is the place where I live, the music of my heart, the home of my spirit. So I will build a tent here as a place of prayer." The thieves were moved by his father and gave up their swords to follow him. To this day, a stone tablet stands in one corner of the school, inscribed with these words. In 1901, Tagore founded a school in Shantiniketan, gathering five or six students. In 1918, the Academy of Art was established, and in the same year, the Graduate School was established. In 1921, it was formally reorganized and renamed International University. In 1922, the Rural Reconstruction Institute was established, and in 1937, the Chinese Academy was established, headed by Mr. Tan Yunshan.</p>
<p>School Life</p>
<p>The school takes nature as its environment, and classes are mostly held outdoors in the forest. Tagore believed that the best teachers to inspire children are forests, mornings and evenings, moonlight, wind and rain. Every morning and evening, teachers and students pray under the forest, singing hymns to praise God. The purpose of his education is to harmonize the relationship between the individual and the group, nature, and God. The dormitory arrangements separate men and women. Each dormitory has a teacher who lives with the students. Class time is from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. In the evening, there are group games and various literary competitions. On the night of every full moon, all the teachers and students in the school are treated to a meal prepared by the female students. And the outdoor dance games of the female students are especially appreciated. The whole school adopts a co-educational system, but the female students have separate household affairs and other classes, and there are also extracurricular activities groups. In terms of teaching, the whole school is divided into the headquarters, that is, primary and secondary schools, universities, and graduate schools. These are described below:</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>For ages six to sixteen, the contact between teachers and students is extremely close. Each class must not exceed fifteen students. The curriculum pays special attention to the study of plants near the school site, in order to train children's observation skills. Older children must also come into contact with the residents of the village. In addition, books, handicrafts, and music are also very important. The handicraft course includes manufacturing daily necessities, gardening, roads, woodworking, textiles, and nails, wood carving, and painting.</p>
<p>University Department</p>
<p>There are two purposes: one is to cultivate profound literary scholarship, and the other is to improve students' skills for making a living. The history curriculum does not focus on politics and war, but on the achievements in culture of each period. Special attention is paid to the relationship between India and the outside world. All university students must understand current affairs and have insight into the social conditions and emerging movements of various countries. The Rural Reconstruction Institute has various industrial and agricultural courses. The Academy of Art, since its establishment in 1918, has become one of the main art colleges in the country. The works of art of this academy have formed their own school. On the one hand, it preserves the inherent artistic spirit of India, and at the same time absorbs the strengths of art from various countries. Its murals are especially famous. Tagore himself composed no less than 2,500 songs, which have made a great contribution to national music. As for dance, the contribution of this academy is also quite significant. The university library has a wealth of books, including various modern texts in English, German, French, and Italian, as well as various modern Indian texts, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese books. In addition, there are 3,000 valuable handwritten volumes. There is also a children's library attached to the school.</p>
<p>Graduate School</p>
<p>Founded in 1918, its purpose is to establish a central area for Oriental studies. The curriculum includes the Vedas and ancient Sanskrit classics, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, various religious philosophies, Indian Aryan linguistics, Persian literature, Pali, various modern Indian languages, and comparative religion. In addition, the faculty of the Graduate School are assisting in the proofreading work of the original text of the Mahabharata, and are retranslating the lost Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist scriptures. Students who come to study at the Graduate School include those from England, France, Germany, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Austria, the Dutch East Indies, and China.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Situation Unusually Stable, Can Ensure Neutral Status, People of All Countries Must Cooperate, U.S. Military Maintenance Absolutely Will Not Withdraw</h3>
<p>The joint Anglo-American declaration, indicating that the two countries will take further concerted action, has formed a great force for stabilizing the world, and the democratic camp has also been strengthened by this, enough to curb the spread of the fierce flames of aggressive countries and eliminate them. The environment of Shanghai has been surrounded by aggressive forces for several years, especially the southward deployment in recent months, which has increased the possibility of a new war in the Pacific, making Shanghai's position precarious. Under this quiet situation, people of insight have loudly called for the United Kingdom and the United States to eradicate the remnants of appeasement, and to no longer condone or tolerate the Far East situation and the possible crises and threats Shanghai may encounter, but to choose the most effective theory and practice to maintain Shanghai's traditional neutral position of a hundred years. Now that the United Kingdom and the United States have issued a historic declaration guaranteeing human happiness and peace, it is tantamount to the most serious warning to those who play with fire, causing them to be wary.</p>
<p>Maintaining Shanghai's Six Major Principles The above opinion was expressed by a foreign leader in Shanghai to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency. According to him, based on the eight principles of the Anglo-American Joint Declaration, we have formulated a declaration to guarantee Shanghai's status: (1) Shanghai must not be sacrificed under the ambition of any country to expand its power and seize territory; (2) Shanghai's territory belongs to China and must not be changed without the will of the people; (3) The Shanghai Concession authorities should respect the people's right to choose the form of the Concession administrative organs, and the administrative power of the Concession should maintain its traditional form and not allow any country to control or manipulate it; (4) Shanghai's import and export trade must be unrestricted and free in order to meet the needs of economic prosperity; (5) The countries related to the sea should cooperate in all aspects to cope with the difficulties of the times and ensure economic progress and social peace; (6) After China's victory, Shanghai should restore the peaceful state before the war, and the people should live and work in peace, with guaranteed life, property, and freedom, abundant and without fear.</p>
<p>Chinese People Should Have National Consciousness In short, in order to make the above six principles sacred and inviolable, the five million Chinese and Western people in Shanghai must always have the highest degree of vigilance. On the Western side, under the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States, they should work together, unite, and cooperate. On the Chinese side, they should enhance their pure national consciousness and lay a solid spiritual foundation. Anyone can believe that Shanghai's legal status can only be maintained in the people's determination to avoid evil and pursue good; otherwise, the entire Shanghai is in danger of being swallowed by evil forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Stationed in Shanghai Will Never Withdraw Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun suddenly published a message that the soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai would all withdraw from Shanghai. It stated that the soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai had recently secretly prepared to withdraw, and a part of them would be withdrawn to the United States and the Philippines on the 25th of this month, which shows that the situation in the Far East is already in a state of urgency. According to authoritative foreign sources in this port, the reporter of the Pingming News Agency said that this news is probably the same as the past mistaken purchase of British commercial properties in this area as the United Kingdom's withdrawal from Shanghai. It is clear that there are other intentions. As a result of the Luoqiu Conference, the United States' position in the Far East has obviously been enhanced. The United States will never give up its interests in Shanghai. The U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai is purely for protecting the interests of the American expatriates here. If, as rumored by a certain party, the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai is about to withdraw, it would be a precursor to the United States giving up its interests in Shanghai. Its illogicality is self-evident.</p>
<p>Changes in Officers of the Fourth Regiment Seth of the U.S. Naval Medical Corps has been ordered to come to Shanghai to serve as the commander of the Surgical Medical Corps of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, to replace Commander Pan Leiqi, who has been in office for many years and is leaving Shanghai. It is learned that the commander arrived in this city on the 13th of this month from Manila aboard the President Coolidge, which was officially announced by the Fourth Marine Regiment yesterday. It is learned that after graduating from the California Medical University in 191x, the commander joined the U.S. Navy Medical Corps and served in the Marine Corps. Before serving in Shanghai, the commander had served in the U.S. Navy Department in Manila for a year. The commander of the First Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment has also been officially announced to appoint Major Pi Que as the commander. Major Pi arrived in Shanghai on the 14th of this month from San Francisco aboard the President Harrison, succeeding Commander Zha. During the First World War, Major Pi was sent overseas to lead the Sixth Marine Corps in combat and was seriously wounded. After recovering, he returned to the front line and joined forces with General Pan Xun to lead the troops in combat. For his bravery in combat, he has successively won the Silver Star Medal of Honor, as well as the Hurd Gray Yangtze Service Medal and other victory war lapel buttons. In addition, Captain Xieer and Qi Lianmu, the newly appointed captains of the Third Battalion of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, also came to take office on the 14th aboard the President Harrison.</p>
<p>Japanese Believe Current Situation Can Be Maintained According to the Japanese-language Mainland News, Shanghai's trade is completely dependent on the overseas situation. Therefore, it adopts a cautious attitude towards the movements of London, Washington, and Tokyo. After the outbreak of the German-British and German-Soviet wars, Tokyo adopted a policy of continuing to maintain the status quo. The day after issuing a freeze order to British banks, British companies were unable to withdraw deposits, and it was extremely difficult to pay the salaries of their employees. Later, the restrictions were slightly relaxed, but the impact on the British side was still very significant. Among them, the control of exports by customs and the lack of ships were the most serious. At present, various American companies are in contact with the local consulate general, hoping to obtain the necessary import permits. The withdrawal of funds from various American banks is also relatively easy. However, due to the control of exports from Shanghai, ships coming to Shanghai loaded with goods have to return empty because they cannot export the goods. However, because imports are not restricted, Shanghai will still become an international supply base for materials. No matter how the prices are, there will be no problem with the supply of materials. How long can this abnormal development in wartime be maintained? This is what people are speculating about in the future.</p>
<h3>Gela Di Ordered to Fly to the Philippines to Prepare for Wartime Shipping, Investigate the Entire Economic Structure of the Far East, Specific Actions Will Be Taken When Necessary</h3>
<p>Mr. Gela Di, Chairman of the U.S. Presidential Shipping Company and former Assistant Secretary of State, was ordered by President Roosevelt to come to the Far East to conduct a comprehensive economic investigation, so that the connection between the military defenses of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands can become more robust and perfect. Gela's arrival will also redistribute U.S.-British shipping to and from East Asia, so that Asian raw materials can be transported to democratic countries, and the mechanism will be improved to avoid negligence and fall into the hands of the Axis powers. It is learned that Gela is scheduled to fly from the United States to Manila tomorrow, and then inspect the Dutch East Indies and Malaya. He will also travel to the wartime Chinese capital. The Chinese government and the public here have expressed their welcome.</p>
<p>The Mission of This Trip Is Concentrated in the Philippines According to the New Voice News Agency's inquiry to relevant parties, Gela's mission will focus on the Philippines, in order to determine (1) the possible repercussions after the outbreak of war in the Pacific; (2) in view of the lack of ships in wartime, (A) the implementation of the U.S. Maritime Commission's micro-use of U.S. shipping orders, (B) the extent to which U.S. shipping will replace British shipping in the Far East, (C) U.S. shipping will replace British shipping in the Pacific, so as to extract tonnage and strengthen British freight in the Atlantic, (D) In view of the importance of Australian and Greek shipping in the Pacific, the needs in the event of a reduction in the export market are determined; (3) agricultural loans and other assistance to save its economy.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Sino-Philippine Liaison Movement When Gela Di investigates the third point, although the scope of the investigation is only for the relevant countries in the East, he will especially provide more assistance to China in terms of economics. The relationship between the Philippines and China and the needs of trade between the two countries in an emergency will also be adjusted, so that the United States can transport what China needs from the Philippines, which is closest to China, in the shortest possible time. It is learned that this matter will be assisted by Mr. Haiste, the adviser to Mr. Shayi, the U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines. Gela's stay in the Far East must be from six weeks to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Meetings May Be Convened in Shanghai in the Future Gela's subsequent footsteps will reach Singapore, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, India, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and Chongqing, all of which are on the inspection list. He may also come to Shanghai for a trip. Gela also plans to hold discussions with economic experts from various countries, and then list the economic assets and institutions of various places into a table, so that specific actions can be taken when taking action, such as prohibiting oil, financial cooperation, etc., or used to control shipping in the Far East and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Shipping Problems Are Specifically Considered On the other hand, Gela's purpose is to obtain detailed information on all the economic forces available to democratic countries in the face of the threat of war in the Pacific. As for the freezing of the implementation order, the freezing in China and against Japan are within the scope of Gela's investigation. The shipping problem of American merchants in the Far East in the future will be one of the things that will be paid attention to during this trip. After all, shipping is the lifeline in wartime. According to Gela, he graduated from St. Mary's College in Baltimore, USA, in his early years, and then taught at New York. In 1919, he served as a commercial counselor and went to the United Kingdom, and was later promoted to Assistant Secretary of State. At the beginning of this year, he was appointed as the general manager of the U.S. Presidential Shipping Company.</p>
<p>Confucius' Birthday Is Approaching, Flags Are Hung to Celebrate</p>
<p>The 27th of this month is the birthday of the most sage and teacher Confucius. All sectors of the public in this city regard this day as a national memorial festival. According to the flag-hanging measures agreed upon by various groups and the Concession authorities, it is decided that the Blue Sky White Sun National Flag shall be hung for one day on this day. However, due to the special environment of Shanghai and the extraordinary period, it is not intended to celebrate the ceremony in a big way, but to engage in spiritual commemoration.</p>
<p>Offices Are Closed The Jianghai Customs, Post Office, First Special High Court, Second Court, silver and money industry member firms and villages, money industry reserve, rice market, Public Works Bureau, Municipal Council, and their affiliated agencies, factories, and organizations in this city have all been notified that they will be closed for one day on this day. All counties will also celebrate with flags. All levels of schools in the city, with Confucius' birthday coinciding with the third National Teachers' Day, will suspend classes and hold memorial ceremonies to explain the meaning of the memorial.</p>
<p>Police Alert The police authorities of the two Concessions, although Confucius' birthday is not a revolutionary memorial, but due to the special environment, are sincerely afraid that unscrupulous elements will take advantage of this memorial date to engage in illegal activities and endanger the entire security of the Concession. Therefore, it has been decided to prohibit all gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 25th, and strictly enforce the curfew laws. At the same time, all sectors of society are promoting the Cold Clothing Donation Movement.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Newspaper Reduces Size</h3>
<p>Japan, due to a lack of materials and insufficient paper, has ordered domestic newspapers to reduce their size by half a page, reducing the number of pages to two large pages in the morning and evening. That is, the two Japanese newspapers in this port, the Mainland News and the Shanghai Daily News, also notified readers on the 16th that they will be implemented from the 18th. The Mainland News explained the reason as "in accordance with the national policy of saving on newspapers." In the future, the morning and evening newspapers will publish a total of one and a half pages, which is half a page smaller than before. On Sundays and memorial days, the evening newspaper will be closed. The Shanghai Daily News explained the reason as "in order to save on newspapers, maintaining the status quo is impossible." In the future, the morning newspaper will publish one page every Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, two pages will be published.</p>
<h3>Needy Students Long for Fellow Qinghe to Help, Ninth Record of Aid Student Visit</h3>
<p>"Fate will make me fall into the bitter sea of dropping out of school. Suddenly, I saw the righteous act of the Shen Bao readers' scholarship, which made me so happy. I hurriedly went through the formalities, silently prayed for success, and looked forward to the arrival of the investigators every day, hoping to get sympathy and help."</p>
<p>This is a sincere appeal from a female student who has encountered a very unfortunate situation and whose environment will not allow her to continue her studies.</p>
<p>Her father was transferred to Chongqing to serve after the war broke out. Two years ago, his salary was 70 yuan. Fortunately, only she and her mother lived in Shanghai, and they lived in her aunt's house, so there was no rent and the expenses were very small. Relying on the small amount of money sent by her father and the rewards earned by her mother's needlework, they worked hard to maintain their livelihood, and sometimes they could even have a little surplus. Unexpectedly, her father suddenly lost contact in the spring of last year, and several registered letters did not receive a reply. As of now, there is still no way to get the exact news of her father's safety. Of course, the economic aspect has become a problem. All the meager savings have been completely used up, and now the food also depends on the not-so-rich aunt's house. Under such circumstances, how difficult it is for her to continue her studies!</p>
<p>When her mother stated their situation, her voice was trembling and her eyes were red; her daughter lowered her head and seemed to be silently experiencing the pain of her encounter.</p>
<p>"Hoping for the help of the gentlemen is as urgent as hoping to get news from my father!"</p>
<p>This is the sincere message of this female student who is very eager to study and whose environment will not allow her to continue her studies. (C)</p>
<p>A Commemorative Process</p>
<p>A top student in a church girls' school; she has experienced a thorny journey in life. The following is a commemorative process in her life:</p>
<p>The ruthless artillery fire destroyed her hometown, and the few properties in her family were reduced to ashes. At this time four years ago, in the midst of extreme chaos in the local situation and extremely inconvenient public transportation, she followed her parents and led her younger brother, fleeing from the war zone - her hometown - and came to Shanghai. But Shanghai had no relatives or friends to rely on, and no ability to rent a house, so they had to enter the refugee camp run by the Xujiahui Catholic Church and live the life of refugees. Fortunately, there were also refugee school facilities in the refugee camp, and she continued her studies in the refugee camp. A year later, the war in one corner of Shanghai had calmed down, and the camp was disbanded. Of course, they were no exception. However, because of her excellent grades in the school, she was specially promoted by a priest of the Catholic Church and sent to a nearby church girls' school to continue her studies. All the expenses for tuition, food, and accommodation were provided by this priest. It can be said that she was able to study with peace of mind for these two years thanks to this priest. Who knew that good times would not last long. The priest was suddenly ordered to be transferred in the spring of this year. The succeeding priest ended her preferential treatment because she was not a Catholic. The school also rejected her preferential treatment for the same reason. From this semester, everything must be the same as other students, paying tuition, food, and accommodation fees. How can she raise this considerable amount! Although her father, after returning to her hometown, was engaged in reorganizing her old business, she has been able to barely maintain the expenses of the family. However, she still can't cope with the huge educational expenses of her daughter. After her father pieced together a number of money, but it was still far from the required expenses, so she had to apply to this newspaper for a portion of the tuition fees, hoping to get sympathy and help, so as to fulfill her wish to study.</p>
<p>Sincere attitude, upright character, especially the advantages of this student. (C)</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Establish Additional Judicial Consuls in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently decided to add judicial consuls, with 28 consuls and vice-consuls and 26 clerks, in view of the increase in the number of Japanese residents in China and the sharp increase in litigation cases, which is not enough for the original judicial consular personnel. It is learned that Shuntaro Sato, the second chief of the Treaty Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been assigned to come to Shanghai in the middle of next month to contact the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai regarding the establishment of a judicial consul general.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Price Limit Abolished, Plan to Sell at Flat Price</p>

The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association has decided to convene an executive and supervisory committee meeting today to discuss a good plan, and has formally issued a notice yesterday. According to the members of the association, the existing five major coal briquette factories dare to try to withdraw from the association on the pretext of wanting to increase prices. However, the association has always been consistent in seeking the welfare of all members, and will never allow such people to act against the trend. The points to be discussed at the association's meeting that day are as follows: (1) plan to continue to lead all colleagues and host flat-priced coal briquettes; (2) recommend that the two Concession authorities improve the coal briquette evaluation method and expect to achieve effective results; (3) discuss specific measures to punish illegal coal profiteers.</p>
<h3>A Study of the Origins of Taoism Yang Zhongyi</h3>
<p>At the 20th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on "A Study of the Origins of Taoism," and Mr. Ding Zhonghu lectured on "Methods for Preventing and Curing Diseases." The two gentlemen alternated their lectures, attracting the special attention of the audience, resulting in an exceptionally good and sustained atmosphere. Mr. Yang's "A Study of the Origins of Taoism" stated: The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of "cultivating the Way," and Confucius said "one thread runs through it all." The Way was originally a public name. Zhuangzi's "Tianxia" chapter began with the techniques of the Way, and Sima Qian's "Essentials of the Six Schools" concluded with morality, but neither of these is the Taoism of the Han History. The man of Lacquer Garden believed that "a scholar with limited views finds self-concealment; the techniques of the Way were fractured into methods," while Lan Ling believed that "the essence of the Way is constant yet ever-changing; the limitations of the six masters are all but a corner of the Way." Even broad and great perfect men like Lao Dan, Meng Ke only said, "The ancient techniques of the Way exist in what they do," not daring to immediately approve it as the Way of inner sagehood and outer kingship.</p>
<p>Since Ban Gu adopted Liu Xiang's "Seven Summaries" in the "Treatise on Literature and Art," he began to regard Huang-Lao as Taoism. Later, Xiang Kai of the Later Han Dynasty transmitted the saying "Huang-Lao and Buddhism are equally revered." Tao Hongjing of the Southern History Biography referred to "Taoist people and Taoist masters" together. Even monks were called Taoist people, indicating that "Tao" was a public name for the three teachings. Emperor Qin and Emperor Wu of the Han both favored magicians. Huan Tan's "New Treatise" still referred to magicians, indicating that the name "Taoism" did not yet exist.</p>
<p>During Wang Mang's time, there was a Taoist priest named Ximen Junhui. The "Biography of Fifth Lun" of the Later Han Dynasty began to use the term "Taoist priest." Xiang Kai's biography states that during the reign of Emperor Shun, Gong Chong of Langye presented his teacher Yu Ji's divine book of one hundred and seventy chapters, titled "Book of Great Peace and Purity." The "Biography of Zhang Lu" in the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" states that "Ling, the ancestor, studied Taoism at Huming Mountain and created Taoist books." Chapter 28 of the "Cloud Satchel of the Seven Tablets" states that he "transmitted it to Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, who received the Way of Orthodox Oneness and Covenantal Majesty." Song Chen Yuanjing's "Extensive Records of Seasonal Observances" contains the ancestral biography of the Han Celestial Master. The "Tea Fragrance Chamber's Three Jottings," Volume 18, Tian Shi article cites it, as well as Zi Heng and Sun Lu. The "Biography of Huangfu Song" in the Later Han Dynasty mentions "Zhang Jiao of Julu," who called himself the Way of Great Peace. The "Dian Lue" states that "Zhang Xiu was in Hanzhong" and called himself the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. After Jiao was executed and Xiu perished, Lu occupied Hanzhong and later surrendered to Cao Cao, calling it the Way of the Celestial Master. His son Sheng moved to Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi, continuing the lineage of Taoism. In the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era of the Song Dynasty, Zhang Zhengshui of Longhu Mountain was bestowed the title of Master of Emptiness and Tranquility, and the Shangqing Temple was built. In the thirteenth year of the Yuan Dynasty, the sixty-sixth generation Zhang Zongyan was summoned, bestowed the title of Celestial Master Who Inherits from the Han Dynasty, and made a spirit-responsive, peaceful, and harmonious perfect man, hereditarily governing the Taoism of Jiangnan. It has been passed down to the current Zhang Enpu, the sixty-third generation. His father, Xiaochu, was a licentiate who excelled in poetry and lyrics. In the winter of Guihai, Dr. Li Jiabai invited him to Shangxian Hall to lecture on the true principles of Taoism. At that time, I was the chief representative of the Confucian Teaching of the International Educational Affairs Federation, and thus had the opportunity to exchange verses with him.</p>
<p>The "Biography of Wang Yizhi" of the Jin Dynasty states that "the Wang family served the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice of the Zhang family for generations." The "Biography of Sun En" states that he "served the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice for generations. His uncle Tai was killed by Wang Daizi of Kuaiji. En attacked Kuaiji, harming the Inspector Wang Ningzhi." Zhong Rong's "Shi Pin" (Poetry Ranking) mentions Xie Lingyun, whose family, because it was difficult to have sons and grandsons, entrusted him to the Du Zhi established by the Celestial Master's Taoism. He returned at the age of fifteen, hence the name "Guest Child."</p>
<p>Taoism began in the Three Kingdoms period and flourished in the Six Dynasties period. The "Collected Explanations" of the "Chronicle of Emperor Qin" in the "Historical Records" quotes the "Inner Records of the First Ying of the Perfect Man of Taiyuan": "The great-grandfather Meng," which is the ballad that says, "The immortals obtained were the first made of thatch, riding dragons rising into the Great Purity, continuing for generations, arriving in me Ying." According to the genealogy, he was the great-grandfather Meng, the great-great-grandfather Yan, the grandfather Xi, and the father Zuo. He gave birth to Lord of Destiny Ying, Lord of Established Records Gu, and Lord of Preserved Life Biao, who were called the Three Maos of the Southern Dynasties. The "Biography of Ge Hong" of the Jin Dynasty states that "his ancestral uncle Xuan obtained immortal techniques during the Wu period and taught them to Zheng Yin. Hong studied under Yin," writing "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity" in one hundred and sixty chapters, with those discussing alchemy named the Inner Chapters.</p>
<p>The "Biography of Tao Hongjing" of the Liang Dynasty states, "He obtained the 'Biography of Divine Immortals' by Ge Hong, which contains the 'Record of Nourishing Life.' He secluded himself in Jurong's Jurong Mountain, which is the Eighth Grotto Palace, the heaven of Jintan Huayang, the place where the Three Mao Lords of Xianyang of the Han Dynasty attained the Way." According to the "Records of Mao Mountain" and Tao Yinju's "True Declarations," the founder was Madam Wei of Mount Heng, who transmitted the "Yellow Court Classic" to Yang Yi, the chief scribe of the Situ Gongfu, which was then passed on to Xu Mu, the chief scribe of the Protectorate General, and eight generations later to the mountain recluse Tao Zhenbai. The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the "Book of Wei" states that "Taoist Priest Kou Qianzhi was granted the position of Celestial Master by the Supreme Lord Lao, bestowed with twenty volumes of commandments for chanting new rituals in the clouds, and Li Puwen, the Master of the Soil, bestowed the inlaid true scripture. Emperor Taiwu revered and obeyed, changing the era name to True Lord of Great Peace. When the emperors ascended the throne, they would personally go to the Taoist altar to receive talismans," resembling the Pope of Rome. The "Remote Survey Chapter" of "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity" mentions Wei Boyang's "Inner Classic." Peng Xiao's "Preface to the Annotated Meaning of the 'Book of Correspondences'" of the Later Shu of the Five Dynasties states, "He secretly showed it to Xu Congshi of Qingzhou, who hid his name and annotated it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, it was again bestowed to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery." Zhu Xi and Cai Yuanding emended it, naming the altered name Taoist Zou Xin of Kongtong.</p>
<p>According to the genealogy of true immortals, Lao Dan transmitted it to Donghua, who transmitted it to Zhongli Quan of the Han Dynasty, who transmitted it to Lü Yan of the Tang Dynasty, founding the school of golden elixir. Yan transmitted it to Liu Cao of the Liao Dynasty, whose disciple Zhang Rui was famous for his "Awakening to Reality," which was transmitted through generations to become the Seven Perfect Ones of the Southern Lineage. It was also transmitted to Jin Wang Jia, dividing into the Seven Schools of the Northern Lineage, and Qiu Changchun alone received the Yuan Ancestor's great favor, governing both monks and Taoists, called the Quanzhen Teaching, as seen in the "Distinguishing Falsehood Records" by Shi Xiangmai. Moreover, the "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" in the "History of Yuan" states that in addition to the Quanzhen and Zhengyi schools, "Liu Deren of the Jin Dynasty was transmitted five times to Li Xicheng, who was seen by Emperor Xianzong and called the True Eight Ways." "Xiao Baozhen of the Jin Dynasty transmitted the Taishang Sanyuan Fawang, teaching the Taiyi." The Taoist canon began with the books of techniques, numbers, and magic in the "Treatise on Literature" of the Han History, but the Taoist school is ultimately not Taoism.</p>
<p>At the end of the Han Dynasty, there was the "Classic of Great Peace." After the Jin Dynasty, Taoist scriptures were gradually compiled, as seen in the "Remote Survey Chapter" of "The Master Who Embraces Simplicity." The "Treatise on Scriptures and Books" of the "Book of Sui," Zheng Qiao's "General Treatise on Literature and Art" of the Song Dynasty, and Zhang Junfang's "Preface to the Seven Tablets of the Spiritual Box" claimed that the Heavenly Treasury Record was completed in seven treasuries. The "Detailed Annotations to the Directory of the Daoist Canon of Bright Clouds and Empyrean" divides them into the Dongzhen, Dongxuan, Dongshen, Taixuan, Taiping, Taiqing, and Zhengyi seven sections, called the Three Caverns and Four Supplements. There are also continued Taoist canons, essential extracts of the Taoist canon, etc., which are still in circulation today.</p>

<p>Shot Upon Exiting the Car At around 1 p.m. yesterday, Fan was supposed to attend a friend's banquet. He took car No. 671 to the Grand Theater for work. Unexpectedly, as the car stopped in front of the theater, and Fan leaned over to get out, three men suddenly jumped out from the roadside and opened fire on Fan. Caught off guard, Fan was shot in the right buttock. Fresh blood flowed, and his white silk long gown was stained bright red. He collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest and Opening Fire Seeing that their goal was achieved, the shooters quickly fled eastward into the alley next to the Grand Theater. Fan's driver, Shun Sheng, a native of Chuansha, saw his employer injured and shouted for help. The patrol police at the scene heard the alarm and rushed to pursue, whistling as they gave chase. The shooters opened fire in resistance, and a burst of gunfire erupted. Subsequently, the shooters turned south onto Zhejiang Road and fled for their lives.</p>
<p>One Police Officer Dies on Duty The Old Kaifu police station received the news and quickly dispatched a large number of detectives to pursue and encircle the shooters.

<p>Teacher Training Institute for Secondary School Women's and Infant Hygiene Enrolling Students</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that physiological hygiene is extremely important to domestic affairs, and that attention should be paid to pregnant women's hygiene, postpartum hygiene, infant care, etc., which are all related to obstetrics. Therefore, the curriculum standards for domestic affairs for junior and senior high school girls have been revised to expand the scope of teaching, so that they can obtain basic obstetrical knowledge and acquire knowledge and skills in family medical care and hygiene. The midwifery education circle in this city believes that these teachers need special training to truly benefit secondary school students. Therefore, Wu Yichu, Zhang Senyu, Zhu Yanggao, Qu Shaohang, Yang Yuanji, and others have initiated the establishment of a Teacher Training Institute for Secondary School Women's and Infant Physiological Hygiene. The institute is attached to the two midwifery schools of Zhongde and Dade. The courses are taught by Cheng Mugu, Yang Yujie, Wu Yichu, Huang Zhongqiang, Zhang Senyu, Tong Zhiqing, Su Zenhsiang, Zhu Yanggao, Fei Zhonghua, Qu Shaohang, Yang Yuanji, and others from the medical community. It is heard that the main purpose of their teaching is to integrate the theories and experiences of various subjects into one furnace. Therefore, not only can those who wish to teach physiological hygiene in junior and senior high schools receive a wealth of knowledge, but also those who do not teach but perform midwifery duties can also gain unlimited experience.</p>

<h3>Physical Education Training in Vocational Schools: Ministry of Education Issues Implementation Measures to Appropriately Strengthen Students' Physique</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Dispatch) The Ministry of Education, concerning physical education in vocational schools, previously stipulated a 20-minute exercise period between classes daily. However, due to the heavy academic and practical workloads of the schools, many were unable to comply. Noting that the "Provisional Measures for Compulsory Extracurricular Exercise in Secondary Schools," promulgated by the Ministry, were also difficult for vocational schools to implement due to heavy workloads, the Ministry, recognizing the urgent need to provide adequate physical training for students, has now specifically stipulated the following four measures for implementing physical education training in vocational schools:</p>
<p>1.  Daily morning exercises for 15 minutes. 2. An additional two hours of physical education classes per week (schools where weekly teaching and practical hours already reach 48 may appropriately reduce lecture and practical hours by one hour). 3. The original stipulation of 20 minutes of physical education daily for each subject is canceled. 4. The stipulation of compulsory exercise after 3 PM may be temporarily suspended if teaching and practical hours are excessive and insufficient time remains. All of the above should be forwarded to all public and private vocational schools under your jurisdiction for strict compliance.</p>

<h3>Review of Frozen Chinese Funds Chen Fengshu</h3>
<p>The author of this article, Professor Chen Fengshu, studied economics in England in his early years. After returning to China, he worked in the financial sector and also taught at St. John's University and Datong University. As the effects of the freeze are not yet apparent and negative phenomena are frequently occurring, various parties are increasingly aware of the seriousness of this "problem." Our publication has already published multiple articles on this topic in past issues. Now, we have received Professor Chen's insightful article. We hope readers will pay attention to it. (Editor)</p>
<p>Significance of the United States Freezing Foreign Funds</p>
<p>The significance of freezing assets is that the rights to enjoy and use all movable and immovable property in the United States belonging to foreign entities are temporarily deprived. The scope of freezing can be divided into two types: one is a complete freeze, such as the freezing of funds belonging to Germany, Italy, and their occupied countries; the other is a partial freeze, such as the current freezing of assets belonging to China and Japan in the United States. This is because the United States still maintains normal international trade with China and Japan, but only for those who obtain permits and make cash purchases.</p>
<p>As for the purpose of freezing assets, generally speaking, it is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Freezing assets has the effect of economic sanctions, such as freezing the assets of Germany, Italy, and Japan; (2) To prevent assets from being transferred to the hands of aggressors, such as freezing the assets of Denmark, Norway, and the occupied areas of China; (3) To promote the economic policies of friendly countries, such as freezing Chinese assets in the United States at the request of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Process of Freezing Funds of Nordic Countries</p>
<p>The process of the United States freezing foreign assets is briefly described as follows: Since the outbreak of the European war in the Nordic countries in April of last year, the United States began to implement the freezing of funds in the United States belonging to European countries that had fallen under occupation. When German troops attacked Denmark and Norway on April 8, 1940, the United States, based on the Trading with the Enemy Act enacted on October 6, 1917, froze the assets of Denmark and Norway in the United States on April 10. Subsequently, the war expanded, and the number of countries frozen also increased. Specifically: On May 10, the US government froze the assets of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in the United States. On June 17, the US government announced the freezing of French assets in the United States. On July 15, it also announced the freezing of the assets of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania in the United States. On October 10, it also announced the freezing of Romanian assets in the United States. On March 13 of this year, the US government froze the assets of Hungary in the United States. On March 25, it announced the freezing of Yugoslav assets in the United States. On April 28, Greek assets in the United States were frozen. On June 14, the assets of Germany, Austria, Danzig, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Italy, and Albania in the United States were frozen one by one. Since the United States froze Denmark and Norway on April 10 last year until it froze the assets of China and Japan, the number of countries frozen has reached as many as 24, and the assets frozen are worth more than 600 million US dollars. In addition, the assets of Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union in the United States are also subject to conditional freezing orders. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the assets of the Soviet Union were unfrozen.</p>
<p>Overview of the Freezing of Chinese Funds</p>
<p>Since the United States and Britain successively froze Chinese and Japanese funds on July 16, the Dutch East Indies also followed suit and announced the freezing of Japanese funds in the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Japan has also taken retaliatory measures by declaring a freeze on US, British, and Dutch East Indies funds in Japan and its occupied territories. Due to space constraints, this article will only provide a brief explanation of the process of the US and British freezing of Chinese funds and its impact on China's wartime economy.</p>
<p>The American Freeze Is Not Thorough</p>
<p>The United States Department of the Treasury announced the freezing of Japanese funds on July 26, which took effect on the 27th. At the same time, the United States government, at the request of the Chinese government, announced the freezing of Chinese funds in the United States. As for the reasons for freezing Chinese funds, generally speaking, they are nothing more than the following points: (1) After the US government freezes Chinese funds in the United States, it can prevent Chinese funds from entering regions outside the United States and China; (2) To give the Chinese government the power to control all funds belonging to its people; (3) This measure can prevent the Japanese from using Chinese legal tender to obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In order to maintain normal trade between the United States and China, the United States issued General Licenses No. 58 and 59, authorizing ten foreign banks in China to engage in foreign exchange within China, and authorizing these banks to provide financial assistance for import and export trade between any part of China (excluding Northeast China) and the United States, Latin America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. These fourteen banks are Chase, Citibank, American International, American Express (the above four are American banks), HSBC, Standard Chartered, Mercantile, Banque de l'Indochine, Old Sassoon, New Sassoon, and Sassoon Banking Corporation (the above seven are British banks), Moscow Narodny Bank (Soviet Union), and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, Banque de l'Union Parisienne (the above are Dutch banks). However, requests for transfer and withdrawal of blocked US dollar deposits are not permitted. The above-mentioned banks, before issuing letters of credit, accepting or paying drafts, or permitting other payments or transfers based on import and export trade, must meet the following conditions: (1) This trade must be legitimate import and export, and the value of the imported and exported goods must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange applied for; (2) This import and export must comply with the terms stipulated in this circular.</p>
<p>The United States government also sent separate circulars to China's national banks, instructing on methods. The contents of the circular issued by the US government to the four banks of China (Central Bank of China), Bank of China, Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China are slightly different from the circular issued to the fourteen foreign banks. The circular allows the four banks of China to buy and sell foreign exchange, but its scope is limited to those stipulated in the general circular; as for other Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange business, they can continue to engage in foreign exchange business within possible limits in the future, but foreign exchange business that has not been completed before July 26 will be handled by the Central Bank. The methods are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>The general circular issued by the US government to the Central Bank is No. 60. This circular authorizes the Central Bank to accept requests from the people to pay or transfer their frozen deposits to domestic banks in the name of the Central Bank, or to transfer the frozen securities to domestic banks. As for all foreign exchange bought and sold by Chinese commercial banks before July 26, the Central Bank will collect and pay on their behalf, but this collection and payment of foreign exchange refers to foreign exchange that is not on the frozen list; the deadline for this collection and payment of foreign exchange is August 15. The actual methods for this collection and payment of foreign exchange are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Method for paying foreign exchange: If a Chinese commercial bank needs to pay foreign exchange, it must immediately telegraph Chase Bank in London or New York to credit it to the Central Bank of China account; at the same time, request Chase Bank in London or New York to send a telegram back to the Shanghai branch, informing the Central Bank of China in Shanghai to confirm that the payment has been received; then the Central Bank will transfer the payment to the original recipient on behalf of the applicant, but the recipient must be a citizen of an unfrozen country (Unblocked National). (2) Method for buying foreign exchange: The Central Bank, in its own name, receives the foreign exchange that the applying Chinese commercial bank should receive, and directly credits it to the account of the Chinese commercial bank. When withdrawing the deposit, it must be handled in accordance with the regulations. The general circular issued by the US government to the three banks of China, the Communications Bank, the Central Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, is No. 61, and its contents are roughly the same as those issued to the fourteen foreign banks, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange, without the special approval of the US government, they will not be allowed to engage in foreign exchange business again in principle. However, the US freeze on Chinese funds is not thorough, so foreign exchange business in normal import and export trade can still be conducted, but speculative transactions are absolutely not allowed.</p>
<p>The British Method Is More Rigorous</p>
<p>The British government, at the request of the Chinese government, announced the freezing of Chinese funds on July 29, and the imperial government followed suit. The British government immediately notified British commercial banks in China on July 29 that all pound deposits, bonds, and cash, whether in China or branches outside China, should be sealed. In addition, assistance is still provided for import and export trade between China and the pound sterling area, and certain foreign exchange transactions may be approved.</p>
<p>Regarding the method for applying for the supply of pounds sterling, the British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile, and Standard Chartered banks. Merchants who have established accounts and whose credit behavior is deemed reliable by the managers of the three banks can apply to the three banks for the supply of foreign exchange; however, the application must specify in detail to which place and bank the payment is made, what kind of goods are purchased, and the amount required. After being approved by the managers of the three banks, a foreign exchange check is issued to allow them to use it. The method is very careful and rigorous, but the detailed method is unknown.</p>
<p>What is the general situation of the freezing of Chinese funds by the United States and Britain? The above is a brief description, and the differences between them will be described in detail: The British government has abolished the method for British commercial banks to pay Chinese foreign exchange depositors in legal tender, and pound deposits, bonds, and cash are all sealed together and absolutely cannot be withdrawn freely; however, American commercial banks can still pay Chinese US dollar depositors in legal tender according to the black market exchange rate, so the method of British commercial banks is more rigorous than that of American commercial banks.</p>
<p>Impact on the Chinese Economy</p>
<p>Since the United States and Britain implemented the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds, and Japan also adopted counter-freezing measures, the impact on Shanghai's general economy is self-evident. This article will only provide a general review of the trade, foreign exchange, domestic exchange, gold market, and price aspects:</p>
<p>Trade: The trade situation in Shanghai has not changed significantly since the freeze was implemented. Although funds are frozen, normal international trade can still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the general circular. Importers can request to purchase and settle foreign exchange from the designated fourteen banks; and exporters can also sell the foreign exchange they obtain to the fourteen banks; but the source of goods that are prohibited from trading will naturally be interrupted, and the import of necessities, if there are no other political changes, can continue to be carried out.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Since the freezing of funds, the value of legal tender against US dollars and pounds sterling in the Shanghai black market has tended to decline. In principle, it should have risen. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: (1) Before the funds of Japanese commercial banks were frozen, fearing that they would be unable to use them once they were frozen, they quickly and massively sold foreign exchange. After the US government issued the freezing order, it became clear that it was not as strict as expected. With the promulgation of the amending order, it became even more apparent that it was frozen but not blocked, so they re-entered, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten. (2) In the speculative frenzy, the shorts, fearing that they would not be able to obtain foreign exchange to offset their positions, had to try their best to buy in as early as possible, resulting in a further tightening of the exchange rate; thereafter, the black market exchange rate should gradually stabilize. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following two points: (1) The speculative buying and selling of foreign exchange has been restricted by the freezing order, and the pressure on the exchange rate has therefore been reduced; (2) According to the provisions of General License No. 59, future trade must be normal import and export, and non-normal imports have been reduced. Due to the two reasons mentioned above, the black market exchange rate will tend to stabilize.</p>
<p>Domestic Exchange: Since the United States and Britain successively announced the freezing of funds, Shanghai's bankers and financiers telegraphed their branches in the interior to sell Shanghai legal tender, causing the exchange market, which had been slightly volatile for several years, to fluctuate greatly; for example, the rise in the exchange rate on August 1 reached as much as 100 yuan; the changes in the Shanghai exchange market over the years have often been affected by Chongqing and Kunming, but this time, Shanghai took the initiative instead of being passive. It is generally believed that the exchange rate will continue to rise in the future and reach the trend of parity exchange between Shanghai and the interior; however, the facts show that this is not the case, and the exchange rate has instead tended to decline. The reason for this is that Hong Kong has become the final refuge for legal tender, and funds from the interior are moving to that place. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) Chinese in Hong Kong are free to buy Hong Kong dollars with legal tender; (2) Hong Kong residents are free to withdraw Hong Kong dollar deposits without restrictions, and non-residents can also do so after approval; (3) Each person can remit 1,500 yuan in legal tender per month to groups outside the gold pound sterling area, and larger amounts can also be done after approval; (4) Within the gold pound sterling group, other currencies can also be bought and sold.</p>
<p>Gold Market: Since the freezing order was issued, the foreign exchange rate has suddenly tightened, and the price of gold has risen as a result. Because black market cash is not on the frozen list, the number of buyers has increased, and the price of gold has become higher. The change in the price of gold is based on the trade exchange rate of HSBC Bank. If the trade exchange rate of HSBC Bank stops quoting, the existence of the black market gold market may also be shaken.</p>
<p>Prices: Prices in Shanghai were already difficult to control. After the freezing order was issued, the general public was overly worried, believing that since foreign exchange was difficult to obtain, the import of foreign goods would naturally decrease, and prices would inevitably tend to rise in the future. Speculators, seeing that a large amount of idle funds had no way out since foreign exchange was frozen, took the opportunity to stir up trouble and do their best to manipulate and hoard goods, causing prices in Shanghai to rise steadily; this is a temporary phenomenon, and the future trend depends on many factors and is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>China's Agricultural Loans Chen Hezhang</h3>
<p>China's rural areas have long suffered from a shortage of funds, resulting in the widespread phenomenon of usury. According to the Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, indebted farm households account for 62% of the total number of farm households nationwide, farm households borrowing money account for 56%, and farm households borrowing goods account for 48%. As for the sources of farmers' loans, according to the analysis of the Agricultural Information Report, 25% come from merchants, 24.2% from landlords, 18.4% from rich peasants, 13.1% from stores, 8.8% from pawnshops, 5.5% from money houses, 2.6% from cooperatives, and 2.4% from banks. It can be seen that only 5% of the turnover of farmers' funds comes from new-style financial institutions, while 95% is controlled by landlords, gentry, shops, pawnshops, and other usurers. The situation of economic exhaustion in rural areas can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The Need for Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>However, increasing agricultural production, adjusting land utilization and distribution, and improving the marketing of agricultural products all rely on the smooth flow of funds. Since the success of the Northern Expedition in the Republic of China in the 16th year, the government, in view of the urgent need for agricultural finance, established new-style agricultural financial institutions. At this time, China's financial circles also shifted their attention to rural areas, implementing rural loans, and also paying attention to the operation of agricultural warehouses. Although the generally impoverished farmers have not been able to completely relieve all the pain of financial oppression, they have indeed obtained considerable benefits.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, the national agricultural financial institutions were the Farmers Bank of China and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau. The agricultural financial institutions at the provincial level were the Farmers Bank of Jiangsu Province, the Cooperative Treasury of Jiangxi Province, the Cooperative Treasury of Sichuan Province, and the local banks of various provinces; the agricultural financial institutions at the county level were the County Farmers Bank of Zhejiang Province, the County Farmers Loan Office, and the county and city cooperative treasuries of various counties and cities. In addition, general public and private banks also engaged in agricultural loan business, such as the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Shanghai Bank, and the Jin Cheng Bank. Later, the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks added an agricultural finance department to adjust the national agricultural loan business. Therefore, the agricultural loan business showed a vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the government has spared no effort in promoting agricultural loans. The number of agricultural loans has increased year by year. According to the report of the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks, from July of the 28th year to February of the 29th year, the agricultural loans to various provinces totaled 151,324,481.46 yuan. The distribution is shown in the following table according to region:</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that Sichuan Province accounts for the largest part, with a proportion of 28.08%: followed by Jiangxi, accounting for 7.86%; followed by Jiangsu, accounting for 7.82%. As for Shanxi and Suiyuan, due to the special environment, the proportion is extremely small.</p>
<p>If classified according to the target of agricultural loans, cooperatives account for 47.23% of the total; cooperative treasuries account for 27.21%; and agricultural warehouses account for 5.43%. The situation is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>According to the later report of the Joint Savings Society of the Four Banks, the agricultural loans issued to various provinces in the 29th year totaled 209,502,167 yuan. The following table shows the details: Province Agricultural Loan Amount (Unit: Yuan) Percentage Sichuan 80,744,385 28.54 Xikang 847,000 0.40 Guizhou 14,223,589 6.79 Guangxi 12,178,797 6.00 Ningxia 400,000 0.19 Yunnan 7,874,033 3.76 Hunan 18,306,342 8.74 Jiangxi 2,385,440 5.43 Guangdong 604,444 0.29 Zhejiang 4,873,041 2.35 Henan 4,575,531 2.18 Shaanxi 13,151,783 6.28 Gansu 9,711,000 4.64 Jiangsu 1,981,545 0.94 Anhui 8,439,000 4.03 Hebei 1,414,000 0.68 Suiyuan 57,000 0.03 Shandong 3,136,000 1.54 Hubei 8,068,635 3.85 Fujian 1,192,000 0.57 Shanxi 202,000 0.10 Other 665,602 0.32 Sichuan-Guizhou-Shaanxi-Hunan Border Area 5,000,000 2.39 Total 209,502,167 100.00</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that, except for Shaanxi Province, the circulation of agricultural finance is mostly concentrated in the southwestern provinces. The agricultural loans in Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces reached 133,729,146 yuan, accounting for 63.83% of the total. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Honey Dates Offer New</p>
<p>New honey dates have recently been launched one after another. A small number arrived initially, and the first market sold for 400 yuan. As the source has increased, the market price has dropped by dozens of yuan. The price of Tu Tu is 330 yuan, with each upper and lower grade adding or subtracting 4 yuan. The market is mediocre.</p>
<p>New Branch Dry Back Loose</p>
<p>The first two batches of new lychee dried on mixed roads arrived in small quantities, and the prices were firm. Now the third batch has arrived in slightly larger quantities, and the destocking is relatively quiet, so the market atmosphere has loosened. Yesterday's market price has dropped by ten or twenty yuan, and hundreds of pieces were traded.</p>
<p>Shrimp Tails and Scallops Soar</p>
<p>The price of shrimp tails has been soaring continuously. For example, the price of Longsong Island tails was only 700 yuan in the previous market, but it has recently risen sharply to 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market opened even higher at 1,180 yuan, a step increase of nearly 500 yuan. Tianbian tails are called 1,200 yuan, Chaobian tails are called 1,500 yuan, and ordinary goods of Yuan Dong tails are called 950 yuan. The arrival of dried scallops is also scarce, and the market price is very tight at 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Bitter Almonds Rebound</p>
<p>The destocking of bitter almonds has recently become more active, and dealers are very interested in buying, so the price has risen. For example, the market price of white-skinned bitter almonds is currently 110 yuan, and the price of red-skinned goods is 105 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared with the previous price. The market may continue to rise. It has been found that this product has been sluggish for a long time, and there may be a reversal of fortune in the future, so it is possible to rise by dozens more yards.</p>
<p>The market for white lead wire from No. 8 to No. 20 has not been weak for a long time. Since the day before yesterday, due to the lack of demand from factories in this street, the number of transactions has been increasing day by day. Yesterday's market opened with about 450 dan thrown away, so dealers' minds are firm and rising, and the standard market price has been raised accordingly. It was found that yesterday's market price was 250 yuan per dan for No. 8 to No. 17, and 280 yuan per dan for No. 17 to No. 20, an increase of ten to several yuan compared with the previous price.</p>
<h3>Matches, Soap, and Candles Are Heavily Hoarded</h3>
<p>In the midst of the rising prices of all goods, the market situation of daily necessities has also attracted attention from all parties. As the foreign exchange market tightens and the situation in the Far East is getting tighter, the supply of raw materials may be interrupted, leading to a resurgence of hoarding. Market prices are rising every day. Yesterday's market price of Beautiful Brand matches rose to 880 yuan per case, Phoenix Brand to 860 yuan, Gu Ben soap to 57.5 yuan per case, You Xiang soap to 48 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap to 45.5 yuan, and Sailboat Brand candles to 37.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Vitamins - Fei</h3>
<p>The vitamins in food are essential for the body's development, health maintenance, and disease prevention. Here's a breakdown of the functions and sources of various vitamins:</p>
<p>Vitamin A: Helps with development, increases energy, protects the body, and prevents diseases of the nose, throat, and lungs. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children need it even more. Yellow and green foods contain vitamin A. High heat and prolonged exposure to air can reduce the amount of vitamin A.</p>
<p>Sources: Cod liver oil, milk, cheese, liver, egg yolk, kidney. Spinach, lettuce, green beans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus, cabbage. Bananas, peaches, oranges, dates, watermelon, etc.</p>
<p>Vitamin B: Can promote development, improve appetite, and strengthen digestion. Because it is soluble in water, the vitamin B content can be lost when food is washed in water.</p>
<p>Sources: Milk, kidney, brain, liver, heart, lean meat, oysters. Grains, beans, sweet potatoes, green onions, cabbage, beet greens. Lemons, oranges, bananas, apples, dates, rice, wheat, oatmeal, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, etc.</p>
<p>Vitamin C: This is essential for maintaining good health. It can resist disease, help heal wounds, and prevent cavities, gum disease, and scurvy.</p>
<p>Sources: Oranges, waxberries, watermelon, lemons, bananas, apples. Cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, green onions, cucumbers, corn, etc.</p>
<p>Vitamin D: The body needs vitamin D to regulate calcium and phosphorus levels. The body can get vitamin D through exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D also prevents rickets.</p>
<p>Sources: The best source is cod liver oil. In addition, milk, egg yolk, cheese, oysters, and sardines also contain vitamin D.</p>
<h3>How to Wash Silk Clothes - One Yuan</h3>
<p>In this hot summer, wearing silk clothes is lighter and more comfortable than wearing cotton clothes. However, because our bodies excrete a lot of sweat, we must wash and change them frequently to maintain hygiene. However, silk clothes are generally thinner than other fabrics, and can be easily damaged if not handled carefully. Here are some simple methods to introduce to readers:</p>
<p>One: No matter what kind of silk clothes you want to wash, you can use willow leaves to boil a liquid, and gently wash them with this liquid. After washing, place them in a shady place to dry, and do not expose them to the sun, which can prevent the original color from fading.</p>
<p>Two: If the silk clothes are white, do not wash them with river water and soap, otherwise the stains will be easily absorbed and difficult to remove. First, rub the stains with tofu, then wash them with clean water, and place them in a shady place to dry, so they can be as white as new.</p>
<p>Three: The best and easiest way to wash white silk clothes is to dissolve soap flakes in warm water, put the clothes in, gently rub them with a soft brush or sponge, and finally add one or two drops of acetic acid (or sulfuric acid). Soak the washed clothes for five or six minutes, which can increase the luster of the silk. It is best to dry them in the shade after washing.</p>
<p>Four: When washing light-colored silk clothes, it is advisable to pour a little lemon into boiling water, and wash them after it has cooled. After washing, place them in a ventilated place to dry until they are half dry, fold the wrinkles, and then dry them completely. Do not expose them to the sun.</p>
<p>Five: If you want to make the fabric firm, then when you wash silk clothes, first put the soap flakes in warm water and soak them slightly, then soak the clothes thoroughly, then take them out and brush them lightly with a soft brush, and finally rinse them two or three times with warm water. You can also put the clothes in warm water dissolved with ammonia, soak them for a while, then take them out and wash them with clean water. This kind of washing method can often give you a firm silk garment.</p>
<p>Six: If you unfortunately get blood on your white silk clothes, don't be alarmed. Quickly take them off, dip a sponge or cloth in water to wash both sides, or place a piece of white cloth on the stain, and put a piece of ice on top of it. Another method is to cut white radish into thin slices and place them on the blood spot, but you need to change them a few times, and the blood stain will be completely absorbed by them, and then wash with cold water, but avoid hot water.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other methods for washing silk clothes, but if you can memorize the above six methods, it is enough to cope with the difficulties you feel when washing silk clothes!</p>
<h3>Design of Green Gauze Windows - Chang Jun</h3>
<p>Many windows and large windows can make the air circulate freely. Originally, it was one of the main conditions of the residence, especially in the hot early autumn. However, if the circulation of air causes mosquitoes and flies to run rampant indoors, and even endanger health, then the loss outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>The best of both worlds is to install screen windows.</p>
<p>In the metropolis, Western-style buildings and noble families originally have no problem with these. Their equipment is complete, the windows are wide and numerous, and iron screens are placed inside and outside. The windows have clear glass. When the windows are opened, the air circulates easily, and mosquitoes and flies cannot fly in.</p>
<p>However, ordinary families do not have such perfect equipment. However, when it comes to hot weather, due to the needs of life, a substitute - silk screen windows - is produced. Although it is not as good as iron screen windows in terms of effectiveness, it is still worth introducing under economic conditions.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to make it yourself, just prepare some green gauze. There are two types of green gauze, coarse and fine. We should use the fine one, because white clams can enter through the gaps in the coarse gauze. If you want to paste coarse gauze, you must paste two layers, which does not seem cost-effective.</p>
<p>The method of pasting is to use coarse hemp rope to tie a paste brush. The paste should be sticky. First, brush a layer of paste around the window frame with the paste brush, and then paste the green gauze, or first use pushpins, and then brush the paste on the window screen. When the window screen is pasted flat, remove the pushpins, and paste a layer of white paper along the edge of the window frame to make it look better.</p>
<h3>Methods to Repel Flies - De Zhi</h3>
<p>In the autumn season, flies are still active everywhere, spreading germs. We are here, as if encountering countless invisible bombers, bombing us without restriction. The danger is great, so flies in the hot season are the great enemy of mankind.</p>
<p>Flies spread bacteria. Although there are many kinds of flies, most of those that transmit germs belong to the housefly family. Their long proboscis can be freely stretched and retracted. The front end is wide and has countless fine folds, so it is easy to suck and lick things. The limbs have hairs, and the ends have adhesive discs that secrete a sticky secretion, so they can adhere to objects. Therefore, if flies stop on food or excrement that contains bacteria, they will suck countless bacteria from their proboscis, and stick countless bacteria from their feet. When they fly to another food, they will immediately spread countless bacteria. This is self-evident. Regarding the spread of bacteria by flies, according to the research of Sir Daniel Jacobson and Eisdian, flies were first prevented from adhering to bacteria, and then released into unclean places. After a certain period of time, they were captured and examined, and it was found that each fly adhered to an average of more than 100,000 bacteria. In addition, 40 houseflies flying naturally were examined in detail using various methods, and it was found that the minimum number of bacteria adhered to each fly was 5.5 million, and the maximum number of bacteria adhered to each fly was 6.6 million. In addition, the most common bacteria found were E. coli, which poses a relatively small direct danger to humans. However, this bacterium is closely related to typhoid bacteria, dysentery bacteria, paratyphoid bacteria, cholera bacteria, etc. Therefore, the above-mentioned bacteria can often adhere to flies and spread with them if they have the opportunity. Fly repellent methods: To get rid of these extremely dangerous flies, it is advisable to eliminate them before their eggs, larvae, and pupae turn into flies. Usually, kerosene emulsion, lime-sulfur mixture, pyrethrum, charcoal powder, bleaching powder, and crude cresyl soap are poured into cesspools, garbage cans, and other places where flies breed. Every two weeks, pour in the solution. However, even after pouring in the chemicals, flies will still inevitably occur from time to time. It is best to find a way to block the flies' transportation. This method is guaranteed to be appropriate. Although there are flypaper, glass fly traps, etc., the fly-attracting methods are not good, so the effect is small. The simplest and best method is to mix formaldehyde, milk, and water in a dish and place it in a place where there are many flies. The flies go to lick it and die near it. There are various kinds of poisoning methods for catching flies. Most people use pyrethrum powder or pills, but using this often causes the chemicals to scatter around, and the corpses of flies are scattered everywhere. Those with a mild degree of poisoning can recover immediately. These two points are its shortcomings, so it is better to use a mixture of formaldehyde, milk, and water.</p>
<h3>Vegetarianism - Editor</h3>
<p>Vegetarianism and superstition are often mistakenly mixed up in the minds of Chinese people. It is believed that vegetarians must be superstitious, and non-superstitious people do not advocate vegetarianism. This is because the motivation of vegetarians in our country often stems from following Buddhism, even the vegetarian diet in June is called Lei Zhai vegetarian diet. As a result, those who advocate breaking superstitions generally believe that vegetarianism is not worth promoting. This is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Those with a little knowledge of food know that the nutrition of meat is inferior to that of vegetables. Vegetables contain vitamins and continuous substances that meat does not have, while meat often contains toxins, wastes, and parasites that vegetables do not have. Furthermore, in terms of digestion, cleanliness, economy, etc., vegetables are far superior to meat. Therefore, vegetarianism is absolutely hygienic, there is no doubt. Therefore, advanced scholars such as Wen Lan Pavilion and Ding Fubao not only practice vegetarianism, but also establish vegetarian associations to promote it. In addition, there are world vegetarian banquets held, and the participants are all contemporary outstanding talents. It can be seen that religious belief is up to each individual, while the practice of vegetarianism is an essential way to health.</p>
<p>To help intellectuals in China gradually understand the value of vegetarianism and the need to promote it, we plan to adopt various vegetarian cooking methods for reference. Zhu Zi said that garden vegetables are more delicious than delicacies. If they can be cooked properly, the pleasure of eating them will not be inferior to bear paws or camel humps. Everyone... if you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu soy sauce extract", as well as oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special delivery will be arranged immediately without taking delivery charges.</p>
<p>One Week of Home-style Recipes - Yu - Corn, also known as corn, commonly known as pearl rice, is something that everyone loves to eat. It contains abundant vitamins, and eating it often is very beneficial to the body. Although it can be eaten as a snack, it can also be peeled off grain by grain and used as a dish. The aroma can be very appetizing. Recently, my family has often used it to make soup. For meat dishes, it can be stewed with beef, cabbage, and potatoes. Sometimes it is cooked with chicken giblets and ham slices, which is very delicious. For vegetarian dishes, it can be stewed with shepherd's purse and edamame, which also feels light and delicious. This way of eating is more meaningful than eating the whole corn. Readers may wish to try it.</p>

<h3>Heat Protection Rules</h3>
<p>The health authorities of Pittsburgh, USA, have issued several rules for individuals to follow in hot weather, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention when entering a cold place from a hot place.</p>
<p>(2) Drink more cold boiled water</p>
<p>(3) Do not overeat.</p>
<p>(4) Do not eat spoiled or unclean food.</p>
<p>(5) Do not get angry.</p>
<p>(6) Seek moderation in everything.</p>

<h3>Food Trivia</h3>
<p>In 1837, the regulations of Hall Institute University in the United States stipulated that women entering the school must know how to make a fire and how to wash sweet potatoes. A dog weighing 40 pounds can hold the food of three people weighing 150 pounds in its stomach, so the food that dogs eat is often more than their owners.</p>
<p>Currently, one-third of the world's humans use knives and forks, one-third use chopsticks, and the remaining one-third still use their fingers.</p>
<p>At a recent welcome meeting held in Arabia, the most valuable dish was roasted camel, with three sheep as accessories, as well as eggs and dried fruits, eaten with white rice.</p>
<p>In the United States a hundred years ago, beef, pork, salted fish, and sweet potatoes were preserved and eaten all year round.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of all fish in the UK are sold in hot fish shops. There are 30,000 of these shops. (Hundred)</p>
<p>Who says "people's food is difficult"? There are many people who dislike the fact that a banquet costing two hundred yuan is not grand enough! (Fanxing)</p>

<h3>A Proposal - Promoting the Tutor Movement - Ge Chun - Home Education Supplements School Deficiencies, After-school Tutoring Can Open Up a New Path</h3>
<p>After reading "Two College Students Applying for Scholarships", I have a small proposal for society. I think that for scholarships for college students, the higher the level of study, the more it seems like unearned income on the one hand, and on the other hand, it seems to slightly reduce their self-esteem. For this reason, I think it is better to let them work part-time while studying. And there are many people who do not want to rely on their father's hard work to study, but do not want to deprive others of scholarships. Of course, they are extremely eager to have a part-time job opportunity.</p>
<p>As for where to find evening work?</p>
<p>Here, I hope that public houses with children can hire a college student to tutor their children in the evening or on Saturdays and Sundays. The salary is paid every six months, which can not only or support their studies, but also cultivate their spirit of independence and hard work.</p>
<p>Based on my experience as a part-time tutor for the past year, I deeply feel the inadequacy of school education. I am not saying that school education should be abolished, I mean that in addition to sending children to school, they also need tutoring.</p>
<p>One of the children I taught. Looking at his math exercise book in school, almost all of them are 100 points. Perhaps out of curiosity, I asked him to redo some of the arithmetic questions he had done. As a result, he stared blankly at the white paper for half an hour. After my repeated inquiries, I learned that he had copied from the person next to him for every question. This situation is not uncommon in schools. But if a child enters school and starts copying from elementary school all the way to sixth grade. Ha, graduated! Think about what he has gained? This phenomenon is the same not only in elementary schools, but also in middle schools and universities. Everyone who has been through it probably knows it!</p>
<p>If you have younger siblings or children studying in school, you may wish to take their books and ask them about them in your spare time. The result will be very disappointing. If you ask them sternly why they don't listen in school. One said: "The two people in front are talking all day long, and I can't hear what the teacher is teaching."</p>
<p>One said: "The teacher in school teaches too fast. I went to pick up a piece of paper, and by the time I came back, a large section had already been skipped."</p>
<p>In the innocent hearts of children, this may be the truth. However, can this be blamed on the teachers? With forty or fifty people in the whole class, it would be too much trouble to take care of everyone. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to review them at home. But the father comes back very tired in the evening, how can he teach them? The mother is worried about housework, how can she have this free time, so it is better to let college students or high school students take on this task in their spare time!</p>
<p>You may think that if they are taught in school and then taught at home, isn't that redundant? Yes, if the child is very, very smart, but an average child can only grasp half of what is taught in one or two lessons, and that is probably when he is listening attentively. To make him reach a state of sudden enlightenment, it will take five or six lessons. And two people teaching a book can allow students to gain the best of both. For example, when I was reading Kuai Rou Yu Sheng before, there were two teachers, one was Mr. Xie, whom I admired, and the other was the principal, an English gentleman. Mr. Xie explained to us in detail, while the principal had a pure English accent. He also often told us about English customs and habits. I felt that Mr. Xie taught us what the principal could not teach, but the principal taught us what Mr. Xie could not think of. Therefore, having two people teach is far better than any one person.

<h3>Odds and Ends - Peng Fei</h3>
<p>Son: "Dad, didn't you say before that this is what the lower class eats? Why are you eating it now?"</p>
<p>Father: "Because the lower class can't afford it now!"</p>
<p>Grandma: "I've lived for eighty years, I never dreamed that a dan of rice would cost more than a hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>Daughter-in-law: "Then, is the old saying "rice like pearls, firewood like cassia" only true now?"</p>
<p>Grandma: "…… I forgot that you are the daughter of a rice merchant."</p>
<h3>Eleven - Midnight Song</h3>
<p>She vaguely heard a dog barking wildly in the street.</p>
<p>"Maybe Uncle Zhao is back." She thought this guess was mostly right.</p>
<p>But later she didn't hear the sound of opening and closing the door.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better if Mom could come back today?" She continued to think vaguely. "If I told Mom about learning opera, she definitely wouldn't be angry, maybe she would laugh happily!"</p>
<p>But could her mother, whom she hadn't seen for nine years, still be as young and beautiful as in the photo? Would she already be as old as her father and completely different from before? This was something Mei Bao couldn't imagine at all. She yawned on the pillow, and gradually felt tired. Three or four minutes after she closed her eyes, she seemed to feel that she had returned to the girls' dormitory of Hengshui County Middle School.</p>
<p>"Miss Wu, there is a lady outside looking for you." Just as she was reviewing her lessons, an old nanny ran in excitedly and said to her.</p>
<p>"Where?" She stood up immediately.</p>
<p>"Waiting in the reception room!"</p>
<p>After just one turn, she walked to the entrance of the reception room. At the end of the long rectangular table, which was covered with a white cloth all year round, sat a graceful and elegant young woman, who hugged her eagerly as soon as she saw her.</p>
<p>"Mei Bao, why didn't you come to see me once in nine years?" Mom asked with red eyes.</p>
<p>She seemed to know where her mother lived, and felt very embarrassed when asked this way. (187)</p>
<h3>The "Vase" Job Application - Yin Zi</h3>
<p>On the thirteenth of last month, I actually received a notification letter in great anticipation. After I opened it and read it, really, I was extremely happy at that time. I secretly thought that my unemployment for the past six months had been saved. It turned out that a certain company was recruiting a female accountant, and I was luckily selected. But when I recalled the day of the interview, how apprehensive I was!</p>
<p>The letter notified me to start working at the company on the fifteenth.</p>
<p>On the day I entered the company, I was introduced to Manager Wang by Mr. Xia, the deputy manager from the previous interview. He was a tall, thin, and funny man in his early thirties. He immediately expressed great admiration for my being selected from among more than fifty female applicants; and praised my English, Japanese, and Chinese and foreign accounting skills.</p>
<p>"Miss Yu, we are really lucky to have an accountant with such talent as you! Well... this will indeed have a great development in business, don't you think?"</p>
<p>From then on, he kept calling me "Miss Honey" this and "Miss Honey" that. Two or three days later, when the company was just closing in the evening, he came over and asked me if I wanted to go to Da Guangming to see a movie. At that time, I declined with an excuse. The next day, I don't know why, he suddenly bought perfume, rouge, nail polish, etc. to prepare to give to me. I was very surprised: what does he mean by this! I said: "Mr. Wang, thank you for your kindness, I don't use these. Please take them back and give them to your wife to use!"</p>
<p>"Haha" he laughed. "Miss Yu, you don't know that I don't have a woman yet..."</p>
<p>But in the end, I didn't accept his "gift". However, I later wanted to influence this manager in terms of work and personality, and wanted to improve his personality so that he wouldn't be so bored. But, before a few days had passed, he actually asked me to go to the ×× dance hall to dance; but I sternly refused him: we must not talk about love under such circumstances. I also said: "Since you love me, can't we start loving each other in our careers first?" In fact, this was what I had to say to get rid of him in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the thirty-first day, Deputy Manager Xia said to me: "Miss Yu, we feel very sorry, but yesterday you made a mistake in an account, which is obviously your negligence. Therefore, Mr. Wang's meaning is... oh... actually the manager said you are too cold and don't know how to socialize... Here is your half-month's salary, fifteen yuan... you don't have to come tomorrow." (Payment)</p>
<h3>Are They Going to Hold a Religious Ritual Again? - Zhu Juran</h3>
<p>The autumn brought by the hurricane has arrived in the world. The people on the isolated island are mostly prescient; they are going to decorate the autumn, and there will be gongs and drums in the alley, which is the autumn ritual on the isolated island.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that holding a ritual is a kind of superstitious act. However, every year every alley always has this kind of ceremony, but the scale is slightly different. Some of the reasons for holding it may be to raise money, and some are caused by special elements in the alley taking advantage of the situation. As for whether the ritual is helpful for eliminating epidemics, we knowledgeable people seem to have been arguing about it for too long.</p>
<p>Just the manpower, materials, and financial resources consumed by holding a ritual are very alarming. If it really has the effect of human affairs, then these consumed money and manpower are still a little worthwhile. Look: isn't it true that many people on the isolated island still die from epidemics every year? Aren't the epidemic hospitals crowded? Human affairs have not yet been exhausted, why bother with ghosts?</p>
<p>Friends on the isolated island! Don't you still feel the high cost of living? Why do you still want to waste so much money? Why don't you use this money to do some "human affairs"?</p>
