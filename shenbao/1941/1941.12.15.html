<h3>傳統先敎授講科學的人生觀　（續八日）</h3>
<p>人生苦樂</p>
<p>「人生的過程」根据前面所討論的結果、人生猶時需要刺激、遇到刺激、復設法克復之、而人與貓之不同處、即刺激越來越精緻、克服刺激之法也愈益巧妙、使新的回復更爲美善、　「何謂苦樂」生命之本身無所謂苦樂、苦樂之人類心理上對外界所發生的一種主觀的感覺、其他動物與人在同一環境中、不會有同一苦樂感覺、二個人對同一事件亦不能有同一主觀、樂就是需要之得到滿足、苦可說是經過相當努力、未曾得到滿足、所以苦和樂是不能不分開的、天下沒有無苦的樂、也沒有無樂的苦、　「人生是否苦的呢」答案是這個世界、這個人生是一個最可能的愉快世界、只有這個世界裏面、才有快樂、我們承認這個世界是苦的、釋迦牟尼說人生有八種苦、即生苦·老苦·病苦·死苦·愛別離苦·怨悄離苦·求不得苦·五陰盛苦·但是我也覺得人生有八樂、爲生樂·靑年樂·平安樂·不死樂·愛相會樂·怨憎離樂·求知得樂·五陰適中樂·總而言之、寡慾足以减苦、發展文化足以加樂、但人生是一種不斷奮鬥的過程、奮鬥成功就是樂、奮鬥失敗就是苦、</p>
<p>人生目的</p>
<p>「人生發展之階段」從心理學或文化歷史學上看來、先爲物理世界、本身物質條件、應備齊全、其次爲生理階段、用本能上的行爲以滿足維持生命必需的條件、再爲心理世界累積過去之經騐解決現在的困難、打開將來的出路、最後爲精神世界、在維持自我生命延續種族血統之外、再追求較高價値、如枓學家的求理、藝術家的求美、宗敎家的求善、　「人生發展之趨向」由毫無自我之表現進而至無意識之受自然界之絕對支配而漸起自覺、再進而自我支配外界而不能支配內心、最後將進於同時支配外界支配自我、　「人生目的」即人類從支配自然界來延續我們的生命、再進而控制內心、以求眞美善的最高價値、　「如何達到此目的」則不外乎擴充自我、與毀滅自我兩方面、這已經是講到我們做戲應該怎樣做法問題、這大概有三種看法、（一）即是何不脫了戲裝還我本來面目、「這是根本辦不到」（二）即是何不馬馬虎虎唱戲、做完下塲了事、這結果給其他做戲的人罵、看戲人扔茶杯、必無好下塲、（三）雖是做戲、不妨假戲眞做、做的人也得意、看的人也起勁、那又何樂而不爲呢、而且台上做戲認眞、我想下台後、大槪還可說是一個好人、（完）</p>

<h3>各銀行定明日起恢復營業原狀　提款採用滙劃制度　票據交換亦即恢復</h3>

<p>戲劇雜話</p>
<h3>談鬚生</h3>
<p>— 恕吾</p>
<p>鬚生也稱老生，居劇中重要角色之一。因此對於他的一切，限制得很是嚴密。別的角唱「倒」一二個字還不打緊，如果鬚生唱倒了字，那就是大毛病了。所以對於他的定則是「字正腔圓」。不過字要唸得正，腔要唱得圓，實在不是容易的事。像現今的一般靑衣和花旦，每句唱詞總有十分之三四的字是唱倒的，然而她們仍不失其爲名旦。鬚生呢，就不成了，因爲他的一切，必須得特別講究。</p>
<p>皮簧中本來是拿鬚生爲主的，後因人材缺乏，旦角便漸漸提高，而鬚生的地位也因是顯出低落；這原因或者是一般學戲劇的人，以爲鬚生好學，以致馬虎從事，產不出傑出的人才。例如小生的字要咬緊了；靑衣的字要讀得準，而習鬚生的對此反不研究，以爲道也是小生，靑衣的規矩，却不知鬚生的字尤其要咬得緊和準！如此現在要找全材鬚生就太少了。</p>
<p>全材鬚生除了「字正腔圓」外，還得「唱，做，唸，打俱佳，文，武，崑，亂不擋！」以前老譚在世，確是當之無愧。鑫培死後，論者皆謂「叔岩得其功架，又宸得共唱工」。實則叔岩較又宸高明些，只有叔岩可算是全材鬚生，他除了唱比老譚的韻味薄一些外，其餘都能與老譚對抗，「定軍山」「別母亂箭」統是他的名劇，無論唸白，咬字全下過一番刻苦的攻夫，如「定軍山」白口之驚人，別母亂箭」神氣之佳妙，「焚棉山嗓音之淸越，「白莽台」聲容之並茂等。而且他的嗓子雖小和低，但坐在末一排的聽衆也可以聆得十分眞切，比那大嗓子一味瞎喊的伶人反覺淸楚動聽。</p>
<p>其次，可來談個高慶奎。此老本以做工勝，雖然，有一部分人喜歡他的大嗓子，實際上他的唱工，除韻較厚味外，並不怎麼高明：武工也只能對付，比譚富英差得遠。尤其是，眼上無神，嘴上乏勁。他好在那裏呢？在於能把唱，做完全戲劇化。常見有些伶人在唱的時候什麼都不管很把劇中的情感拋開，唱完了再做戲。這是最要不得的。馬連良母唱悲劇原板，動聽和興奮，可使人忘去愁悶，忘去劇中的他或是將死的人；不過如此一來把悲劇的空氣打破了。</p>
<p>我們看高慶奎的「哭秦庭」，可使聽者忘掉他在唱戲，在他唱大段反調時，只見其哭，「空城記」他唱得更佳，那一段二六好像和司馬懿談話一樣，是多麼的自然，和諧。像這種表演才是合乎戲劇的。</p>

<h3>克拉克蓋博的趣事</h3>
<p>— 慰曾</p>
<p>當克拉克還是很落魄地當着臨時演員的時候，某晚他在回家途中碰到了一個漂亮的臨時女演員，他就請她乘他那部老爺汽車回家。他在車中對她講他家中是怎樣的富有，他的拍戲完全是娛樂性質的。大約離他們的目的地還有一哩路的時候，克拉克突然轉着了一個念頭，他就裝得很輕鬆地對她說：「這兒我要轉灣了，我們再見吧？」於是那個女郞祇得徒步回家。而克拉克轉了灣後把車子停在路旁後也步行返家。三天後他借到了買汽油的錢後才把車子取回。這個女郞便是珍妮蓋諾，而此後她便不大理睬他了。克拉克對人家說：「這或許是我無謂的虛榮，但是我從未有機會能向她解釋讓她獨自回家的理由呀！」</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十九章　黃昏胡騎塵滿城</p>
<p>我想你是吳三桂心中最最寵愛的人，那小子此次不肯投降於我，反向我苦苦作對，就是爲了你。他無非要想從我手中把你取還，好如了他的心願，所以……，」李自成說到這裏，上下牙齒一咬，臉色益發可怕了，戟起二指，指着圓圓又說道：「我偏不使他如願，硬起心腸來，把你砍了，看那小子到那裏去找你？」圓圓驟聞此語，心中驚駭萬分，玉容失色，勉强極力鎭定，說道：「啊呀！大王竟忍殺害賤妾嗎？賤妾的性命本來輕如鴻毛，一死何足惜？但大王獨不爲自己打算嗎？」李自成聽了，面上又露出疑訝之色，問圓圓道：「你說這話是什麼意思？」圓圓道：「賤妾初聞吳將軍接得大王招降的書文，本要捲甲來歸的，祇因賤妾的緣故，所以又興干戈。現在大王倘然殺了賤妾，恐怕他益發懷恨大王，務要報仇，那麼死一賤妾，於大王又有何益呢？還請大王三思爲幸。」李自成一聽這話，不免又躊躇起來，臉色漸漸放下。又對圓圓說道：「那麼我就不殺你了。帶你同行吧。」圓圓聽了，心裏又是一急，暗想自己若被李闖帶去，那又是非常危殆的，只此一去，不知何時重返了。忙又說道：「賤妾旣事大王，豈不欲跟隨大王同行，但恐吳將軍因賤妾之故，更要窮追不已；大王走到那裏，他也要追到那裏的。現請大王三思而後行。倘然大王的兵馬能够殺得退吳將軍的，那麼賤妾即當　裳跨騎以從。」李自成聽圓圓這樣說，他低倒頭凝思不巳。（二三九）</p>

<h3>Japanese Reinforcements in Malaya 100 Miles from Singapore; Japanese Troops Capture Kowloon and Advance on Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Special Dispatch from This Port, 14th: According to a broadcast from Manila, authoritative sources in London claim that Japanese troops in Malaya are only 150 miles from Singapore. The size of the Japanese reinforcements is still unknown, but it is said to be substantial.</p>
<p>Gong Wen Da Mei Evening News, Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: "Asahi Shimbun" reported today from Shanghai that fresh Japanese troops, munitions, and military supplies are being continuously transported to Malaya to reinforce Japanese forces fighting against the British.</p>
<p>London, 13th: Reuters, citing official sources, reported that Japanese aircraft attacked Penang Island three times today.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 14th: Regarding the Malayan war, Reuters' Singapore correspondent reports that British troops in Malaya are facing significant difficulties in their fight against the Japanese. While official communiqués remain silent about the frontline battles, it is an undeniable fact that the Jitra area is preparing for a fierce battle. Japanese troops advanced into the area from Thailand two days ago, and the fighting is taking place in dense forests. The Japanese army has overcome difficulties in this mountainous terrain, swimming across rivers in several engagements and appearing behind British lines. Japanese infantry also have lightly motorized units supporting them along the railway lines. As for the British forces, including Indian, English, and Scottish units, they are fighting bravely, determined to resist to the last man and the last bullet. The British air force, originally intended to prevent Japanese landings, is now also assisting infantry operations, but unfortunately, the air force cannot exert its power in the dense jungle areas, so infantry must rely on their own strength in the northern region. In addition, Australian, British, and Dutch fleets are attacking Japanese concentrations in areas without jungle cover, and Japanese motorized units are also being targeted for bombardment. As for other areas on the Malayan front, the situation remains unchanged. 600 women and children have been evacuated from Penang Island and efforts are being made to send them to safer locations.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Refuses to Surrender</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 14th: The British Broadcasting Corporation has confirmed that the Governor of Hong Kong has rejected the Japanese demand for the city's surrender to avoid unnecessary sacrifice.</p>
<p>English Da Mei Evening News, Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Of the enemy's major bases, Hong Kong is the most likely to be occupied by Japanese forces first in the five days since the start of the Pacific War. After occupying Kowloon eighty hours after the start of the war, the Japanese army has now begun a fierce attack on Hong Kong, and the fall of the city is imminent, as the Japanese army completed the encirclement of Hong Kong on Wednesday night when they occupied Kowloon. The Japanese General Headquarters announced this morning that the Japanese army has begun attacking Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong area has been subjected to continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft for the past few days. The British garrison in Hong Kong retreated from the first line of defense yesterday after Kowloon was occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>English Da Mei Evening News, Allied News Agency, Kowloon, 14th: British artillery positions in Hong Kong began bombarding Kowloon yesterday in an attempt to contain the Japanese advance. At the same time, six ships were seen destroyed by Japanese aircraft in the waters between Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula. British soldiers were patrolling the opposite shore, indicating that the Japanese army will advance at any time.</p>
<p>London, 13th: War analysts say that if the Japanese army occupies the mountains surrounding Kowloon, Hong Kong will become a target for Japanese artillery. The entire Victoria City and the residential areas will be only four or five miles from the Japanese artillery positions, and the situation in that area is not optimistic.</p>
<p>British Forces Launch Three-Pronged Attack on Thailand</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: According to a report in the "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" from Bangkok, British and Chinese forces crossed the border at Xing Simai in northern Thailand and engaged in fierce fighting with Thai troops from the afternoon of the previous day. They have now been repelled by Thai forces and retreated to the north.</p>
<p>Bangkok News: The Thai Defense Command announced that in the northern sector, on the afternoon of the 12th, British forces invaded Chiang Mai in northern Thailand from the Burmese border, and were repelled by Thai troops. In the western sector, on the morning of the 13th, Burmese forces invaded Thai territory near Mae Sot and engaged in fierce fighting with Thai troops. In the southern sector, on the morning of the 12th, Indian-Burmese forces invaded Thai territory near Pula Jo in the Pan Zhuba area, and were immediately repelled by Thai regular army and police forces.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 13th: The British Broadcasting Corporation has just announced that "the British authorities have declared the port of Calcutta in India and East India to be danger zones."</p>
<p>Japanese Paratroopers Land in Luzon</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 13th: The Philippine Defense Command has just issued a military communiqué stating that a squadron of Japanese aircraft bombed Cebu City and Clark Airfield again today. "Japanese troops are only conducting skirmishes on Luzon Island, and the fighting is not significant. The Japanese operational plan has been completely exposed, and their goal is to occupy temporary air bases, which are all defended by our land forces."</p>
<p>London, 13th: According to Reuters, hundreds of Japanese paratroopers and landing troops in the mountains of northern Luzon engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Philippine troops for several hours.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies to Adopt Scorched Earth Policy</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 14th: According to news from London, Batavia has announced that the Dutch East Indies government is preparing to adopt a large-scale destruction policy, similar to that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Vichy Denies Vietnamese Mobilization; Western Newspapers Comment on Japanese-Vietnamese Alliance</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 13th: Responsible sources here have denied the claim that the Governor-General of Vietnam has ordered a general mobilization.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 14th: According to newspapers, the signing of a military alliance treaty between Japan and Vietnam is a major international event.

<h3>Thailand Freezes British and American Funds; Cabinet to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>English Da Mei Evening News, Allied News Agency, Bangkok, 14th: Thai Prime Minister Sangran has announced the freezing of British and American funds in Thailand and stated that Thailand will sever diplomatic relations with Britain and the United States, which is a "natural consequence" of Thailand's alliance with Japan. The Thai Prime Minister made the official announcement to reporters at 11:00 AM, stating that this move was taken to counter the steps taken by the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: According to "Asahi Shimbun" from Bangkok, regarding the reorganization of the Thai cabinet, the new Foreign Minister will be Pananda, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Commerce. He is a close associate of Prime Minister Songkran and Education Minister Song Kramaya. The cabinet is expected to be reorganized by the beginning of next week, and pro-British and American cabinet members will resign.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The Japanese Embassy in Thailand is preparing to establish a Japanese-Thai Committee to promote political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Fighting Continues on Wake and Midway Islands; Communications with Guam Interrupted</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 13th: The Navy Department has issued a communiqué stating that "submarine and wireless communications between the United States and Guam have been interrupted. The island has likely been occupied by Japanese forces. The American garrison consists of only 400 personnel, 159 of whom are U.S. Marines. According to the last reports from Guam, the island was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and paratroopers landed in several locations. However, Wake Island and Midway Island are still resisting."</p>
<h3>Pacific War - A Week in Review</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th: In the week from December 6th to 12th, the European War transformed into a World War due to Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States on the 8th. Germany's situation is completely different from that of World War I. Japan's opening of a second battlefield in the Far East has diverted a large number of enemy forces. Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States on the 12th. Japan launched a lightning-fast offensive against Britain and the United States simultaneously. Pearl Harbor in the United States was heavily bombed, losing three battleships and one aircraft carrier. In addition, four battleships and four cruisers were damaged. Guam and Wake Island were occupied. Japanese troops landed on Luzon Island, surrounding the port of Manila, and destroyed one aircraft carrier. At the same time, Japanese troops also obtained the right to pass through Thailand. On the 10th, the British naval battleships "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse," totaling 60,000 tons, were sunk by Japanese aircraft. In Hong Kong, Japanese troops have launched a land offensive. British troops attempting to invade Thailand have been repelled. Large numbers of Japanese troops continue to land on the Malay Peninsula. Japanese troops have established airfields in Kota Bharu and Kuantan. Singapore has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Previously, it was only known that one German commerce raider was in the Pacific and had sunk the Australian cruiser "Sydney." It is now confirmed that several more will appear in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<h3>Hawaiian Islands Bombed; U.S. Navy Secretary Returns to Capital After Inspection</h3>

<h3>German-Soviet War Stalled; Quiet on Libyan Front</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Switzerland, 13th: According to a dispatch from the "Basler Nachrichten" correspondent in Berlin, German public opinion is focused on the war in the Pacific. The Eastern Front war has stalled due to the winter and is being viewed with indifference. As for the Libyan war, news is scarce. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech shows that the British acknowledge that their planned military objectives have not been achieved. All parties in Germany have complete confidence in General Rommel, commander of the Axis forces in Libya. Hitler's recent speech only mentioned General Rommel's name. British claims of victory are only of a local nature, and a war of attrition is now taking place.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th: Military experts supplemented the German military report of yesterday to Haitong News Agency as follows: On the Eastern Front, there were only local actions. Soviet attacks were all repelled by German forces. The German Air Force's airstrikes on Soviet concentrations and railway lines were very successful, destroying one train and heavily damaging another. The tracks were cut in several places. German aircraft also attacked Moscow at night. In North Africa, the German Air Force destroyed many British vehicles. The port and airfield of Tobruk were heavily bombed again, and a fuel depot caught fire after being hit.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 14th: The Finnish Command announced yesterday that there was enemy artillery activity in the western part of the Karelian Isthmus on Friday. An attempt by a Soviet patrol to advance was repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Several Soviet artillery positions on the Svir Front were silenced. Finnish troops occupied several small islands south of Vosyaveri, and more than one hundred Soviet soldiers were captured or killed. The Finnish Air Force intermittently bombed the Murmansk Railway, and one enemy aircraft was shot down in an air battle north of Kronstadt.</p>
<h3>Spain's Policy Unchanged; Portuguese Military Representative Visits Britain</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 14th: Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer informed U.S. Minister to Spain, Mr. Feitel, that although Spain is experiencing these turbulent times, it will maintain the same diplomatic policy. This is the Spanish authorities' response to the American Minister's inquiry.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Lisbon, 13th: A six-member Portuguese military delegation flew to London today for a visit.</p>

All British nationals must register with the police authorities within 48 hours. When the European War broke out in 1939, there were approximately 500 British nationals in Hungary.

<h3>Finland's Diplomatic Relations with the U.S.; Finland Claims No Consideration of Severance</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Helsinki, 13th: A government spokesman stated that neither Finland nor the United States has considered severing diplomatic relations. Commentators believe that Finland is unlikely to change its attitude towards the U.S., as approximately 300,000 Finnish nationals reside in the U.S., accounting for about one-tenth of the country's population, and the two countries have close ties. However, while Finland is at war with the Soviet Union, it maintains close relations with Germany, making it difficult to avoid disputes with the United States. According to some diplomatic circles, future developments will depend on the war between Japan and the Soviet Union. If Britain and the United States request Soviet assistance in the war against Japan, Finland will be forced to take a clear stance, declare war on the United States, or at least sever diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>

All newspapers also made the same claim.</p>

On other bridges, such as the Tianhou Palace Bridge and the New Garbage Bridge, the barbed wire erected on the bridges has openings through which people can pass, but must be inspected by Japanese sentries who are suspicious. However, foreigners are separately designated to enter and exit via the Zha Pu Road Bridge, with recently issued passes.</p>
<h3>Registration Deadline for British and American Residents</h3>
<p>The registration for British and American residents handled by the Japanese authorities in this city was originally scheduled to end at noon the day before yesterday. However, to give those who had not yet registered a final opportunity, the Japanese Military Police Liaison Department, located in the Hamilton House, decided to extend the deadline to 2:00 PM yesterday. A considerable number of British and American residents have been going to register in recent days. As of the day before yesterday, the number had reached 8,607. However, the Japanese authorities believe that there are still some people who have been unable to register in person due to illness or other obstacles, and they believe the total number should be around 10,000. According to The Times, among the 8,000+ registrants, British citizens account for the largest number, with 5,101, followed by Indian citizens with 2,001, then American citizens with 1,156, and finally Filipino citizens with only 349. This registration started on the 9th of this month and has lasted for five days as of the day before yesterday. However, it is heard that many people have been unable to register in person due to illness, so the Japanese military authorities decided to extend the deadline to allow all British and American residents to register. However, there are no plans to extend it further, so yesterday was the final day.</p>

<h3>Traditional Education Professor Discusses the Scientific Outlook on Life (Continued from the 8th)</h3>
<p>The Joys and Sorrows of Life</p>
<p>"The Process of Life": Based on the results discussed earlier, life still requires stimulation. When encountering stimulation, one must find ways to overcome it. The difference between humans and cats is that stimulation becomes increasingly refined, and the methods of overcoming stimulation become increasingly ingenious, making the new recovery more beautiful and good. "What are joys and sorrows?" Life itself has no joys or sorrows. Joys and sorrows are subjective feelings in human psychology toward the external world. Other animals and humans in the same environment will not have the same feelings of joy or sorrow. Two people cannot have the same subjectivity toward the same event. Joy is the satisfaction of needs, and sorrow can be said to be the failure to achieve satisfaction after considerable effort. Therefore, joys and sorrows cannot be separated. There is no joy without sorrow in the world, and no sorrow without joy. "Is life sorrowful?" The answer is that this world, this life, is the most likely pleasant world. Only in this world can there be joy. We acknowledge that this world is sorrowful. Sakyamuni said that there are eight kinds of sorrows in life: birth, old age, sickness, death, separation from loved ones, meeting with enemies, not getting what one seeks, and the suffering of the five aggregates. But I also feel that there are eight joys in life: the joy of birth, the joy of youth, the joy of peace, the joy of immortality, the joy of meeting loved ones, the joy of separating from enemies, the joy of gaining knowledge, and the joy of the five aggregates being in harmony. In short, reducing desires can reduce sorrow, and developing culture can increase joy. But life is a process of constant struggle. Success in struggle is joy, and failure in struggle is sorrow.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Life</p>
<p>"Stages of Life Development": From a psychological or cultural-historical perspective, the physical world comes first. Material conditions should be fully prepared. Next is the physiological stage, using instinctive behaviors to satisfy the necessary conditions for maintaining life. Then comes the psychological world, accumulating past experiences to solve present difficulties and open up future paths. Finally, there is the spiritual world, seeking higher values beyond maintaining one's own life and continuing the lineage, such as the scientist's pursuit of truth, the artist's pursuit of beauty, and the religious person's pursuit of goodness. "Trends in Life Development": From the absence of self-expression to the unconscious absolute control by the natural world, self-awareness gradually arises, then advancing to self-domination of the outside world but inability to dominate the inner world, and finally progressing to simultaneously dominating the outside world and dominating the self. "The Purpose of Life" is for humanity to prolong our lives by dominating the natural world, and then to control the inner world to seek the highest values of truth, beauty, and goodness. "How to achieve this goal" lies in both expanding the self and destroying the self. This has already touched on the question of how we should act in a play. There are probably three views on this: (1) Why not take off the costume and return to my original self? "This is fundamentally impossible." (2) Why not just act carelessly, finish the play, and be done with it? The result is being scolded by other actors and having teacups thrown by the audience, and there will be no good ending. (3) Although it is acting, it might as well pretend to be real. The actor is happy, and the audience is excited. Why not do it? Moreover, if one acts earnestly on stage, I think one can still be said to be a good person off stage. (End)</p>
<h3>Deposited Fresh Crabs Stolen</h3>
<p>Wan Fulin, a local resident residing at No. 2, Yongqing Lane, Jixiangfang, Lemei Road, French Concession, brought 170 catties of fresh crabs, worth 640 yuan, from Qingpu a few days ago. After arriving in Shanghai, he asked Shi Zhifu (who lives at No. 32, Hengmao Lane), whom he knew well, to deposit them at Heji Refrigerator Store at No. 30, Mengshenfu Road, for gradual sale. Unexpectedly, the next day, he discovered that the crabs had been stolen in their entirety. Wan then found out that Shi had stolen them and reported it to the police. The police instructed detectives to arrest Shi and bring him to the police station. According to Shi's confession, he vehemently denied it. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and verification of the truth.</p>
<h3>Curfew Enforced as Usual</h3>
<p>It was rumored that the curfew measures in the two concessions had been cancelled for a time. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement, the curfew in the Public Concession is still being enforced as usual. The French Concession is also taking the same measures and has not changed them. The curfew time is still 12:30 AM. Residents are advised to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Banks to Resume Normal Operations Tomorrow; Withdrawals to Use Transfer System; Check Clearing to Resume</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, banks and other financial institutions in Shanghai restricted deposits and withdrawals. This has lasted for a week, and now things are gradually returning to normal. After being ordered to resume business, Chinese and foreign banks complied with the Shanghai Municipal Council's instructions. The Council's restrictions on deposits and withdrawals were originally limited to three days. However, due to the adjustment of finances, it was impossible to complete the preparations in a short time. Therefore, the restrictions were extended for another three days starting from the day before yesterday (the 13th), and all Chinese and foreign banks will lift the restrictions and restore their previous business status tomorrow (the 16th). Withdrawals will be paid using a transfer system. For foreign businesses, the Yokohama Specie Bank will handle check clearing. For Chinese businesses, the Shanghai Check Clearing House will continue to handle it. Various industry trading markets are also holding meetings to discuss resuming operations. It is understood that all markets will resume trading within a day or two.</p>

<h3>Shooting Incident Occurred on Avenue Petain Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>One Japanese person shot in the neck; tight security in the extra-settlement area afterward</p>
<p>Near Yidingpan Road on Avenue Petain in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Area, at around 10:25 AM yesterday, a Japanese person was passing by when he was shot in the neck. He immediately bled profusely, fell to the ground, and was injured. The assailant then fled with the weapon and disappeared without a trace. The injured person was then taken to Fumin No. 2 Hospital on Yuyuan Road for treatment. It is said that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening. After the incident, martial law was imposed in the Shanghai West area, blocking traffic and searching pedestrians. As of dusk, things had not yet returned to normal. It is understood that barbed wire fences were set up at the junctions of Singapore Road, Jiaozhou Road, Connaught Road, and Yanping Road. Traffic on Quanxi Road, Haig Road, and Yuyuan Road within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station was also blocked. Pedestrians and vehicles of all kinds were prohibited from passing until midnight, when they were still not opened.</p>
<h3>Four Paper-Wrapped Handguns Were All Fake</h3>
<p>At the entrance of Lane 248, opposite No. 351, Avenue Albert, French Concession, at around 2:30 PM yesterday, a paper package was found containing four handguns. Someone reported it to the French Police. When the police arrived to open it, although the four guns had exquisite and novel designs, they were all made of wood and were fake. The police then took them back to the police station for destruction.</p>
<h3>Daylight Lamp Fee Rate</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council's Board of Directors reviewed the report of the Chief of the Technical and Political Office and recognized that daylight lamps have reasons for increasing electricity costs due to technical factors. It was resolved to allow the company to implement the following measures: A. For existing installation users, they may choose one of the following two: Pay an additional 30% of the normal rate due to power reasons; or install a single-coil transformer on all equipment that can indicate the Cos value, the limit of which will be negotiated by the Municipal Council and the company in the future. B. For new equipment, equipment with a Cos value less than the limit must not be connected to the power lines.</p>
<h3>Rental Cars Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Xiangsheng, Yunfei, Tailai, and Yinse, the four rental car companies in Shanghai, have had their stored fuel tanks sealed. They were only able to operate on the small amount of fuel stored in the cylinders. As of the 13th, all of it had been used up. Therefore, they had no choice but to announce their closure one after another. The four rental car companies have a total of 400 cars: 125 for Xiangsheng, 120 for Yunfei, 65 for Yinse, and 90 for Tailai. Among them, only Yinse was newly established after the war, while Xiangsheng is a giant in the industry, with nine branches. It is heard that other smaller rental car companies have also mostly closed down due to the depletion of gasoline. Therefore, it is temporarily impossible to use rental cars for transportation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Robbery Incidents Recorded</h3>
<p>At No. 631, Zhoujiazui Road, Shanghai East, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, seven robbers broke in, four of whom were armed with guns, and prohibited any noise. They robbed cash and clothes estimated to be worth 3,500 yuan.</p>

<h3>News from the Hubei Native Place Association</h3>
<p>Relief for Disaster-Stricken Compatriots at Ping An Inn: The Ping An Inn on Zhubao San Road in this city was accidentally set on fire by a negligent paper shop next door on November 29th. All the buildings were burned down. The details have been repeatedly reported in various newspapers in this city. All the travelers were awakened from their dreams, scrambling to escape for their lives. All their luggage and clothing could not be taken out. At this time of severe winter, they were hungry and cold, a truly pitiful situation. The Ping An Inn mainly housed refugees from various places who brought their families with them, as well as small-scale merchants and peddlers. Most of them were from Hubei Province. The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai has initiated the organization of the Hubei Native Place Association Preparatory Committee for the Relief of Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in the Ping An Inn Fire to provide relief. In recent days, members of the association have been voluntarily donating money. In addition to providing particularly generous condolences to the dead and injured, those who are being sent back to their hometowns are given 160 yuan per female, 150 yuan per male, and 60 yuan per child under eight years old. Over 300 people have already been sent back.</p>
<h3>Fire on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>At 3:50 AM yesterday, a Russian business on Avenue Joffre, No. 809, French Concession, suddenly caught fire. The fire brigade was notified and rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which took an hour to extinguish. As a result, two rooms were burned down. The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>
<h3>First Special District Court Has Not Resumed Office; Everything Inside Remains the Same and There Are No Changes</h3>
<p>The First Special District Court in this city (North Zhejiang Road) was taken over by the Japanese army on the 8th of this month. The remaining inspectors and all staff members, as well as the families of the hospitalized, were still allowed to move freely. Only three soldiers were stationed outside the hospital gate for protection. The temporary office of the First Special District Court in the Zhirenyong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road and Seymour Road, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road, were only occupied and protected by the Japanese army until the morning of the 10th. However, these courts have not been able to resume court sessions immediately due to various reasons and are still in a state of suspension. It is rumored that court sessions will continue on Monday, the 15th of this month, but the time is probably not enough. Since the court stopped operating on the 8th, all the criminals captured by the police stations have been temporarily detained in the police stations and have not been interrogated. Therefore, once the court resumes operation, the cases handed over by the police stations on the first day will inevitably be extremely crowded.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball Tournament Continues Tonight: Two Games in Group B</h3>
<p>Shanghai Bank vs. West Qing Monarch Blue and White vs. Chen You; Blue and White Withdraws from Group A Due to Insufficient Players</p>
<p>The 14th West Qing Basketball Tournament, which was suspended for a week last week, is scheduled to continue tonight, but the time has been advanced to start at 6:20 PM. There will still be three games. Tonight, there will be two Group B games. Shanghai Bank will play West Qing Monarch (Kings). Both teams are making their first appearance. The latter has exceptionally strong strength and aspires to win the championship. There is bound to be a bloody battle when they meet. In the second game, Blue and White B will meet Chen You. The former is the incarnation of a strong star and its strength should not be underestimated. Chen You's lineup is weaker, and Blue and White B is expected to win. The finale was originally scheduled to be Group A Blue and White A vs. Lianxing. The meeting of the two giants in the game is no less than the final. It is expected to be exciting. Unfortunately, most of the soldiers under Blue and White are students from various universities. Due to the end of the semester, they have left Shanghai and returned to their hometowns. Now there are only three or four team members left, and they cannot form a team. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the West Qing organizers stating their withdrawal. It is a pity that Blue and White was very confident in winning the championship in Group A. The departure of a strong opponent from the group has increased Lianxing's chances of winning the championship. The order of the two Group B games tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Monarch - Shanghai Bank Team 6:20 PM</p>
<p>Blue and White B - Chen You Team 7:15 PM</p>
<h3>Situation of Each Group in the Da Zhong School Small Ball Tournament; Games Suspended Due to Rain Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Da Zhong School Small Ball League, which has been underway for a month since its opening, originally had six games scheduled for yesterday from 1:00 PM, but due to inclement weather and continuous drizzle, the games could not be played and were all postponed. According to the recent situation announced by the organizers, in the university group, Aurora has taken the lead with three wins in three games, followed closely by Pudong with two wins in two games. In addition, Fanhuang also remains undefeated. The championship seat in the future will probably be among these three teams. In High School A, Aurora A also holds the top spot firmly with three wins in all three games, and the remaining teams cannot match it. In High School B, Guangxia and Aurora B each have five points and are tied for first place. Jinlian is in third place with two wins and one loss. In Junior High A and B groups, Aurora and St. Francis are in the leading position. However, Guangxia and Xuhui in Junior B have not been defeated and are eyeing the top spot, so St. Francis cannot be optimistic. The full situation is explored below:</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Commercial Activities During a Week of Publication Suspension</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has been suspended since the 9th, and it has been a week now. Around 4 a.m. on the 8th, the sounds of gunfire and cannons erupted, startling residents from their sleep. Around 10 a.m., Japanese troops entered the concessions in multiple directions, causing a considerable degree of panic at the time. Many businesses and banks that were already open were forced to close again. However, after the Japanese military issued a proclamation ensuring the security of the concessions and stating that private property of the general public would be absolutely respected with no other intentions, the panic gradually subsided. Recently, the Japanese military police commander also prohibited taking advantage of the public's anxiety to seek personal gain through unscrupulous means, threatening severe punishment. After this proclamation, it is hoped that the spirit of the rule of law will be followed, treating people of all nations with fairness and righteousness, which should further stabilize public sentiment. However, in the past week, the various scenes and rumors in the market seemed to warrant documentation despite the newspaper's suspension, so that readers would not feel a sense of interruption. Therefore, I have gathered some news and observations, though they may be belated, to provide some supplementary information.</p>
<p>Crowds Gathered in Front of Bank Counters</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, the Shanghai Municipal Council posted a notice stating that banks would soon reopen. Sure enough, at 9 a.m., various banks opened their doors one after another. However, at 10 a.m., another notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council announced a temporary closure. Starting from the 11th, banks would operate for three hours, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., with a limit of 500 yuan for each household's withdrawal. The frequency of withdrawals was to be determined by each bank based on its own financial situation, with some setting a limit of one withdrawal every three days, others one withdrawal per week, and some stipulating that if a withdrawal was not made in one week, it could not be combined with the next week's allowance. In reality, this was largely a superficial gesture. One bank adopted the third approach for general customers, imposing extremely strict restrictions. However, it was heard that it still secretly accommodated familiar acquaintances, allowing them to withdraw cash every three days. Some with skillful means even managed to withdraw 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in cash and leave. Generally, the counters of all banks were crowded with people. Observing the various banks, although the staff were busy with hardly a moment to rest, many were still able to handle matters calmly, providing patient guidance to customers whose procedures were incomplete, or whose deadlines had not yet arrived, or who had already withdrawn some funds but not the full amount, without becoming impatient. There were also those who habitually put on airs, easily taking out their frustrations on customers, displaying an arrogant and rude attitude that was both infuriating and laughable. The noise level during withdrawals made it difficult for people to hear, so some stood on the counter, shouting out numbers and paying based on tickets to avoid errors. Generally, there were fewer people using Western checks than Chinese checks at each counter. The number of savings account holders and current account holders varied, but at times, savings account holders were more numerous, as they mostly consisted of residents withdrawing cash for daily living expenses. Current account holders were mostly businesses, and the amount of 500 yuan was insufficient for business activities, so some did not even bother to withdraw. Fortunately, the banks were able to open as usual, providing some comfort amidst the panic. There were many rumors circulating in the market, suggesting that if only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would open its vaults and allow other banks to withdraw, the market could be restored. If this could not be done immediately, then for large transactions, only transfers should be allowed, while still permitting cash withdrawals within the limited amount, and relaxing the withdrawal methods, so as not to repeat the high discount rates and limited withdrawals seen after August 13th. Discounting only serves to exploit the interests of depositors and creates more opportunities for profiteering for the banking industry. The operating hours should not be further restricted, as placing both cash withdrawal and time restrictions seems to only consider the convenience of the banking industry while neglecting the convenience of the public. Furthermore, limiting the time adds a serious overtone that is also undesirable. Let's see if there will be improved measures in the near future.</p>
<p>Premium on Banknotes Becomes Prevalent</p>
<p>Since banks have limited cash withdrawals, there is a general need for cash to pay employees' salaries and other expenses. Therefore, it has become necessary to discount banknotes from shops. Currently, most banknotes are in the hands of grain merchants, sellers of northern and southern goods, soy sauce shops, distilleries, salted goods stores, oil factories, daily goods stores, and large companies. There is already an unofficial premium of 2% on banknotes, and even higher in some cases. However, recently, the premium has been smaller. Because banks have restricted cash withdrawals, even current account holders with cash dare not deposit it, regarding it as a rare commodity. Banks are disbursing more than they are receiving, making it difficult to cope. As a result, damaged and torn banknotes are being passed on to depositors, regardless of whether they are usable in the market or not. It is considered a great favor by the bank to still provide cash to depositors in the current situation, as long as the banknote is countable, regardless of whether it is usable in the market or whether the depositor suffers a loss. However, if one is familiar with the bank staff, one can directly enter the inner office, whispering and conferring. One is not subjected to crowding, nor does one have to wait long, and one receives intact banknotes. The various conveniences are too numerous to mention. The unequal treatment of bank customers is a sign of the bankruptcy of commercial ethics and the decline of service. In particular, the attitude of counter number 12 at a certain bank on Sima Road is the worst, with employees often making hurtful remarks. Almost everyone who has had contact with that counter agrees on this. However, this is still a matter of the bank's poor employee management. Considering the overall situation, any restriction often easily leads to the opposite effect. Therefore, restrictions should only be used for temporary emergencies. If the market is to return to normal, it is best not to have restrictions. This can reduce the congestion at bank withdrawals and allow some cash to return to bank vaults. However, restrictions can be placed on unnecessary spending and collateral that promotes speculation and hoarding, which is also a way to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>Various Markets Temporarily Stagnate</p>
<p>Since British and American banks such as HSBC suspended trading, the black market exchange rates ceased to exist. American dollars and Hong Kong dollars also came to a standstill due to the declaration of war by Japan against Britain and America. Those holding these currencies were in a state of panic, unable to dispose of them. There was no official market price, and rumors were rampant, leaving people at a loss. Gold shops initially maintained the exchange rates from the previous Saturday (December 6th), at 1,430 yuan per tael. Later, due to the lack of market activity, many small gold shops removed these price listings, while some still listed 1,500 yuan. Most of the overseas stocks belonged to British and American businesses. Due to these changes, the various trade associations suspended trading, so there were no market prices to speak of. In this state of tight credit, no Chinese merchant had the mood to buy or sell stocks. As a result, those who wanted to sell were forced to accept low prices. Many small pawnshops closed their doors because there was no speculation to be done. Speculative markets such as cotton yarn and raw silk were naturally among those that were suspended. These speculative transactions disrupt the market, shake commodity prices, and easily become a medium for manipulation and hoarding. In the current situation, it is fortunate that they have stopped. As for other various markets, there were only a few spot transactions. Most goods were sealed in warehouses. If the market is to revive, it is necessary to revive the financial system. There is no other solution.</p>
<p>Maintaining People's Food Supply Nears Starvation</p>
<p>Since the control of rice and grain, there has not been panic under the orderly process. However, purchasing has been inconvenient. Now, residents are greatly affected. In order to buy rice, they rise before dawn, inquiring everywhere about where it is sold. If it is available, they rush to wait in line regardless of the distance. They wait regardless of how long it takes, enduring rain and wind, ignoring hunger and cold, in order to obtain rice. Two liters of rice is hardly enough to feed a family, so they bring the old and the young, pushing and shoving, with their chests and backs pressed together, hoping to secure their portion. As a result, there are often thousands of people. For example, on December 12th, when the Xie Chang De rice shop at the intersection of Park Road sold rice, the people waiting to buy rice stretched westward from the shop door, then turned north, along Rue Mayet, near Shanhai Pass Road, resembling a long snake. Even at dusk, it was still so crowded. One can only imagine how many people there were that day. At a certain rice shop on Weihaiwei Road, before 8 a.m., people had already reached the middle section of New Dagu Road. The situation was the same in other places. If rice shops did not refuse to sell rice, there would always be a constant stream of people. Those who could not buy rice turned to buy flour. Once the flour was sold out, with nothing to eat, they rushed to buy cut noodles. Cut noodles were expensive, costing 1.5 yuan per catty, but people were still crowded. So, they put up the "closed" sign and traded from the square window. Some went to buy small breads to fill their stomachs, which usually sold for 0.25 yuan but were now selling for 0.35 yuan. The sweet potato market was too strong, and there was nowhere to buy them. Large pancakes were considered too expensive. Although corn flour cakes did not suit their taste, they were also selling very well. On the sidewalks, the cart pullers' rice vendors sold bowls of rice for 0.3 yuan, and those squatting to eat were no longer just cart pullers. In front of the rice shops, most of the signs said "Rice Sold Out." Because there were few places selling rice, and the number of people waiting to cook rice was large, living on porridge was not uncommon these days. It has only been a few days, and many still have rice in storage. However, the difficulty of buying rice is already like this. In the future, if the number of people waiting to buy rice increases, it will put the entire city's population at risk of starvation. The people's food supply is a major prerequisite for social order. It is heard that private rice and grain stored in warehouses are now allowed to be released, but only a few people benefit from this. Shouldn't we consider improving the current situation for public rice and grain to help the majority of people? The following should be done immediately:</p>
<p>* Immediately release 100,000 bags of rice stored in warehouses and distribute them to rice shops throughout the city for sale.</p>
<p>* Remove the 2-liter limit and change it to 5 liters per unit to reduce possible crowding, reduce the labor of rice shops, and facilitate residents' purchases.</p>
<p>* Residents should not be arbitrarily stopped and confiscated when carrying rice across the road. There have been cases where people borrowed rice from relatives and friends, only to have it intercepted on the way, claiming it was contraband. There was even a case where someone carrying something other than rice, thinking it was a cloth bag, was ordered to stop and forcibly searched. Only when they saw it was not rice did they leave angrily. There was also a case where someone brought rice to Shanghai from the mainland and a cyclist searched and took it away, causing them to sit on the ground and cry. It is unthinkable that carrying food rice is not comparable to theft, yet they are subjected to such harsh treatment. Although this comes from hearsay, those responsible for local security must be aware and must prohibit their subordinates from doing so, regardless of whether it is true or false.</p>
<p>* Now that foreign rice cannot come in, the rice stored in warehouses in the concessions should be completely placed under control. Negotiations should be held with the Japanese military to dredge up the source of rice in the interior, in order to provide for the food supply of the concession residents and seek the reality of living in peace and working happily. Not only should those transporting rice from outside the concession into the concession not be stopped, but they should also be given permits to facilitate circulation within the concession, increase the food supply, and strictly prohibit harassment.</p>
<p>* If rice shops are to be rotated for sale, the areas should be assigned and the rice shops should be rotated daily, so that residents do not have to travel east and west and still have the pain of not being able to buy rice.</p>
<p>* The French Concession authorities should use French ships to obtain rice from Annam and other places to provide for the food supply. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Traded Last Week</h3>
<p>Settled in Full, Reopening Still Undecided</p>
<p>Our newspaper has been suspended for a week since its publication on the 8th of this month. The public bond market also suspended trading from the 8th. However, the transactions made on the previous Saturday (the 6th), totaled about 500,000 yuan. The transactions on Monday and Tuesday of last week were not settled. Subsequently, due to the good market order, all industries returned to normal operation, and financial institutions gradually recovered. Therefore, the transactions made on the previous Saturday were fully settled by Wednesday because the banks issued payment orders and the industry followed suit. There were no problems with the long and short positions. Although the market did not officially open for business on Friday and Saturday, there was still some activity in off-market trading, mostly in Classes A and C. According to the writer's knowledge, over 200,000 yuan was traded successively by Lianyi and Lianhe. The transactions made by other firms are not included in this. The highest price for Class C was 64.9 yuan, and the lowest was 64.3 yuan. Class A traded at 70 yuan even. Class C was several jiao higher than the previous minimum price of 64 yuan. Public sentiment is still stable. However, the routine 12th draw for Class E was not held, or may have been temporarily postponed. It has not yet been decided when the public bond market will reopen as usual.</p>
<p>According to Yongchang Firm, stock transactions that have been completed can still be settled in full in the short term. There have been no unexpected events, nor have there been any urgent requests to sell.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Due to the long-term lack of overseas arrivals of hardware and metals, the inventory is not very abundant. In the past, although daily sales to customers were scarce, the quantity of purchases was still not weak. However, since yesterday and today, sales from the Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao groups have been sluggish, and manufacturers in this street have no appetite at all, so the market has been quite quiet all day. Prices will also be difficult to rise. Yesterday, 200-pound tinplates sold for 1,400 yuan per box, and 200-pound ferrous sheets sold for 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per box (due to the different sizes of the boxes, the thickness and unevenness, and the number of sheets).</p>
<h3>Daylily Costs are High</h3>
<p>Recently, daylilies have become more expensive due to the flat drop in Tianjin exchange rates, resulting in fewer sources. Although the Hong Kong group has suspended operations, the base accumulation is already small. However, inland groups such as Shenjiamen in Ningbo are still handling them, mostly taking mid-range goods. The most recent transaction was for Suqian vegetables, priced at 310 yuan.</p>

<p>Drama Miscellany</p>
<h3>Talking About Lao Sheng (Old Male Roles)</h3>
<p>— Shu Wu</p>
<p>Lao Sheng, also known as Xu Sheng (Bearded Male Roles), hold one of the most important roles in dramas. Therefore, the restrictions on everything about them are very strict. It doesn't matter if other characters sing a word or two "backwards", but if a Xu Sheng sings a word backwards, that's a major problem. Therefore, the rule for them is "correct pronunciation and round intonation". However, it is not easy to pronounce words correctly and sing intonation roundly. Like today's general Qing Yi (Virtuous Female Roles) and Hua Dan (Vivacious Female Roles), about three or four tenths of the words in each singing line are sung backwards, but they are still known as famous Dan (Female Role) actors. Xu Sheng, however, cannot do that, because everything about him must be particularly emphasized.</p>
<p>Pihuang (Peking Opera) was originally based on Xu Sheng, but due to a lack of talent, Dan roles gradually rose in prominence, and the position of Xu Sheng also declined. This may be because people who generally study drama think that Xu Sheng are easy to learn, resulting in careless work and a lack of outstanding talent. For example, the words of Xiaosheng (Young Male Roles) must be tightly bitten; the words of Qing Yi must be read accurately, but those who study Xu Sheng do not study this, thinking that the rules of Xiaosheng and Qing Yi are also the same, but they do not know that the words of Xu Sheng must be bitten even more tightly and accurately! As such, it is now too rare to find a Xu Sheng with all-round skills.</p>
<p>In addition to "correct pronunciation and round intonation," a Xu Sheng with all-round skills must also be "good at singing, acting, reciting, and fighting; proficient in literary, military, Kunqu, and miscellaneous styles!" When Lao Tan (Tan Xinpei, a famous Peking Opera actor) was alive, he was indeed worthy of the title. After Xinpei's death, commentators all said that "Shuyan (Tan Xiaopei's stage name) got his skills, and Youchen (Yu Shuyan's stage name) got his singing." In fact, Shuyan was more brilliant than Youchen. Only Shuyan can be considered a Xu Sheng with all-round skills. Except that his singing lacked some of the flavor of Lao Tan, he could rival Lao Tan in everything else. "Dingjun Mountain" and "Farewell Mother Amidst Flying Arrows" were all his famous plays. Whether reciting or biting words, he had put in a lot of hard work, such as the shocking white mouth in "Dingjun Mountain," the excellent demeanor in "Farewell Mother Amidst Flying Arrows," the clear and melodious voice in "Burning Cotton Mountain," and the complete voice and appearance in "White Mang Terrace." Moreover, although his voice was small and low, the audience sitting in the last row could hear it very clearly, which was clearer and more pleasant than those loud-voiced actors who just shouted blindly.</p>
<p>Next, we can talk about Gao Qingkui. This old man is known for his acting. Although some people like his loud voice, in fact, his singing, except for a thicker rhythm, is not very good. His martial arts can only cope, which is far worse than Tan Fuying. In particular, his eyes lack spirit and his mouth lacks strength. What is he good at? He can completely dramatize singing and acting. It is common to see some actors who do not care about anything when singing and completely abandon the emotions in the play, and then act after singing. This is the most undesirable thing. When Ma Lianliang sings a tragic original board, it is moving and exciting, which can make people forget the sorrow and forget that he is a dying person in the play; however, this breaks the atmosphere of the tragedy.</p>
<p>When we watch Gao Qingkui's "Crying at the Qin Court," we can make the audience forget that he is singing a play. When he sings a long section of counter-tune, we only see him crying. He sings "Empty City Stratagem" even better. That section of "Er Liu" (a type of Peking Opera aria) is like talking to Sima Yi, which is so natural and harmonious. This kind of performance is what is in line with drama.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Art World</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's new costume film "Wang Zhaojun" will be filmed simultaneously with "Private Love," as it has been scheduled to be released on New Year's Day in Shanghai. The male lead, Liu Qiong or Mei Xi, has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Li Lihua's new work is "Songstress's Lament," directed by Yan Youxiang, with Yan Hua as the male lead.</p>
<p>For the new play "Plum Blossom Dream" by Tianfeng Drama Society, Fei Mu plans to personally ask Ying Yin to guest star in a role. Whether this will become a reality is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Jin Xing's new film "Jade Broken, Pearl Round" has been completely completed. Zhang Shichuan's "Shadow of Red Tears" began filming on the 10th.</p>
<p>Shao Hua, an actor from China Travel Troupe, will also join the National Film Company.</p>
<h3>Amusing Facts about Clark Gable</h3>
<p>— Wei Zeng</p>
<p>When Clark Gable was still a struggling extra, one night on his way home, he met a beautiful extra actress and offered her a ride home in his old car. In the car, he told her how wealthy his family was and that his acting was purely for entertainment. When they were about a mile from their destination, Clark suddenly changed his mind and casually said to her, "I'm turning here, goodbye!" So the girl had to walk home. After Clark turned the corner, he parked the car on the side of the road and walked home. Three days later, he borrowed money to buy gasoline and then retrieved the car. This girl was Janet Gaynor, and after that, she didn't pay much attention to him. Clark told people, "Maybe it was my pointless vanity, but I never had the chance to explain to her the reason for leaving her to go home alone!"</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, the Nomad Cavalry, Dust Filling the City</p>
<p>I think you are the most beloved person in Wu Sangui's heart. That kid is unwilling to surrender to me this time, and is bitterly opposing me because of you. He just wants to take you back from my hands, so that his wish can be fulfilled, so..." Li Zicheng said here, biting his upper and lower teeth, his face becoming even more terrible. Raising two fingers, he pointed to Yuanyuan and said, "I just won't let him get his wish, I'll harden my heart and chop you up, and see where that kid goes to find you!" Yuanyuan suddenly heard these words, and was shocked in her heart. Her jade face paled. She barely tried to calm herself and said, "Ah! Does the King really have the heart to kill this humble servant? This humble servant's life is as light as a feather, and death is nothing to regret. But doesn't the King think about himself?" Li Zicheng listened, and a look of doubt appeared on his face again. He asked Yuanyuan, "What do you mean by saying this?" Yuanyuan said, "This humble servant first heard that General Wu had received the King's letter of surrender, and was going to return with his armor rolled up. Only because of this humble servant, he started the war again. Now, if the King kills this humble servant, I am afraid that he will hate the King even more and will definitely seek revenge. Then what benefit is there for the King to kill a humble servant? I hope the King will think again." When Li Zicheng heard these words, he could not help but hesitate again, and the expression on his face gradually softened. He said to Yuanyuan again, "Then I won't kill you. I'll take you with me." When Yuanyuan heard this, she became anxious again. She thought to herself that if she were taken away by Li Chuang, it would be very dangerous again. Once she left, she did not know when she would return. She quickly said, "Now that this humble servant serves the King, how can I not want to follow the King? But I am afraid that General Wu will pursue endlessly because of this humble servant. Wherever the King goes, he will chase there. Please the King think again and then act. If the King's army can defeat General Wu, then this humble servant will ride in ceremonial attire to follow." Li Zicheng listened to Yuanyuan's words, and lowered his head to ponder endlessly.
