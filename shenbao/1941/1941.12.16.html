<h3>洋米搬運証續發　堆棧已逐漸啓封　各米號昨提取倉庫存米民食情况可望日趨鬆弛　麪包廠停止工作已在磋商解決中</h3>
<p>頃悉、日方於宣布本市一切存貨除軍用性質者外，將供公衆使用後、昨日（十七日）下午、開始啓封食物堆棧、其已啓封者、有貯大批米粉之堆棧三或四所、某官員且預料將有更多之貨棧、逐日啓封、</p>
<p>糧食接濟漸有頭緖</p>
<p>工部局刻正以大量洋米　趕速撥交各零售米店、而米店前列隊候購局米之市民、乃開始减少、工部局人員、且料從明日（十九日）起　　局米之羣衆、將逐漸消失、在最近將來、市民可望獲得更多之糧食接濟、因料日當局今日將　續啓封各堆棧也、工部局某員謂、該局與日當局磋商啓封食物堆棧事、進行頗稱滿意、一說日方已許麵粉堆棧重啓、以應民需、</p>
<p>指定堆棧提取洋米</p>
<p>工部局撥派各米店供給零售之洋米、前經發出手動證、指定由厦门路信源棧提取後、各米店業已分別提取、今日可普遍發售、其數量每人仍限為三升計國幣四元、洋米辦事處、昨由各米號繼續携款申請、提取封存於各倉庫之洋米、人數頗衆、經該處先在下層天井中、發給號碼牌、依次序登樓、遞入洋米辦事處、付款塡單申請、當經該處繼續發給搬運證、指定白克路茂泰棧及大華路茂泰棧兩處堆棧提取、以供各米店賡續辦理門售零糶、各米號前向太古棧提取封存洋米、因手續有待完備、而未吿成功、昨日則已可提取、工部局洋米辦事處、撥派若干家米號之洋米、仍指定太古棧提取、故本埠零售米問題、經工部局不斷撥派供應、情勢就鬆弛、</p>
<h3>進口洋米　售價略增</h3>
<p>工部局頃發布吿略稱、定自本月十九日起、進口洋米售與米店之本局售價、改為每重二二四磅（出棧總重量）國幣一百六十二元、同時最高零售價格改為每三升國幣四元一角、</p>
<p>糴米將蓋化學印章</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、工部局鑒於各零售米店、　糴人數之擁擠、難免有一人分數次連續購糴情事、仳於老弱購糴者、殊受其　　、且供求失其平衡、現已決定日內即可由工部局發給各米號以印章及化學顏料一種、是種印章、蓋於每一零糴者之手掌、因是項顏料有化學作用、過二十四小時後、能自動泯滅、如此則可以杜絕上項流弊、</p>

<p>麪包商突停止製造</p>
<p>自工部局訂定麵包限價後、各中國麪包製造商、突於昨日停止製造麵包、此外、兩租界內之外商麵包廠家、亦因所存麵粉之缺乏、及憂慮將來之供應故、而减缓其工作、惟此種困難情形、可望立即尅服、蓋日當局已開始啓封食糧堆棧、而租界當局、亦正加緊撥放麵粉、以供公衆之消費也、壉悉麵包商之代表與工部局方面、已於昨日舉行會議、謀定解決辦法、並取得法租界當局之合作、據稱、中國麵包製造商於過去期間、已獲利不少、當此　艱之際、理應與公衆合作、惟麵包商方面、則謂彼等之麵粉、係於租界當局訂定麵粉與麵包限價之前購進者、故成本頗高、若以目前之麵包限價售出、必致虧本也、又據工部局職員稱、麵包限價殊為公正、若麵包商堅持其立斱、則「吾等將無疑地加以制裁」</p>

<h3>娛樂事業</h3>
<p>— 香谷</p>
<p>上海戰事爆發的時候，上海的娛樂事業雖然一度停頓，但是稍縱即逝；更因社會環境的畸形發展，娛樂事業及較戰前蓬勃；新型的電影院，跳舞塲。在每一個角落里建築趕來；北來角兒的座價高過從前的一担米價；即使始終被上海人所輕視的「維揚新戲」，「高尙越劇」也佔據了娛樂事業的首席……這四年來，上海人是極盡聲色之　了。</p>
<p>遠東戰事又爆發了，一般居民的排隊購米和煤球，依然如舊，但是浸淫在聲色之娛的夢中另一階級的人們，也遭遇到了空前的危難，他們也開始在銀行門前練習一字長蛇陣了；他們所支撐着的娛樂事業，因此一落千丈自然是意想中事，然而客觀環境的演變，更是娛樂事業的最大打擊。</p>
<p>表面的：電車，公共汽車提早在九時前進廠，自備汽車因汽油的統制而「凍結」，夜都市的引擎當然跟着停止活動。首輪電影院最後一塲雖然提早一小時開映，觀衆却祇限於附近的居民了；平劇院已改演日塲，跳舞塲祇能維持二三小時的最高潮，也是創史以來的新紀錄。</p>
<p>至於內在的危機，在最近的將來，這七折八扣的娛樂事業或許也不能維持下去了。因為西片已運抵上海而尙未公映的，據非正式統計，在二百部左右，其中為環境關係而不能公映的，恐在半數以上。報載亞洲影院宣稱，　輪西片也將採取從前二輪西片的輪流放映制，片給的恐慌可想　了。國產影業公司現在還在繼續工作，不過底片的來源已斷，上海的「存底」能够維持幾多？而况國片的最大市場——南洋正在砲火連天聲中！</p>
<p>平劇院的「人」的問題自然沒有關係，平角兒縱不　下，南方伶人能獨擋一面的也都集中在上海，不過平劇的經常開支都相當龐大，最普通的都在每天三千元左右。現在已改演日塲，先無形損失了每星期六日的兩台日戲，每天每院要有二千觀衆來維持這個局面　是困難的事。</p>
<p>那末，門票買一送一的遊戲塲，及座價三角五角的三四輪電影院是否「衆矢之的」呢？洋行，工廠的停業，淪在飢餓綫上掙扎的數十萬工作人員，現在的幾毛錢恐怕也寶貴的了。</p>

<p>生活特寫</p>
<h3>安步當車</h3>
<p>— 韋格</p>
<p>從前有人住在滬西越界築路地帶，每天早晨七時模樣就安步當車，走向達在黃浦江畔的辦公處所去，知道他的都說他獃，表示不屑。　着大好現代交通器其不去享受，而搬動着原始人類也生有的二條大腿，在短促時間內跑送麼遠路，在當時確是超越常人的行動。誰知時至今日，因受太平洋戰事爆發的影響，煤和汽油的供應，發生嚴軍問題，於是公共汽車，電車，都已縮短經過路程，减少行駛時間，，而出差汽車，則已於數日前停止營業了。現在人們還啊短時間的電車公共汽車可坐，但數量較前大爲减少，即這現况容能維持多久，還有問題，那末普遍的安步當車是勢在必行了。</p>
<p>無論坐公共汽軍或電車，車中的張務人員態度却也改善了些。而揩油之風依然很盛。這幾天，因爲車輛經過路程的縮短，和行駛時間的限制，乘客更　得特别擁擠，他們似乎仍不屑作安步當車的練習，而在儘希享受這有限的近代交通利器。因爲乘客的擁擠。這幾天在公兩車輛中所見到聽到的更覺刺耳觸目，自然這是隔岸觀火者的感想，至於身當其衝的我想信定會轉念到「安步當車」這句古人名諺，而亟於預備實行了。</p>
<p>私人汽車也將繼公用車輛及出差汽車而絕迹　頭，是必然的事。所以有人在設計馬車事業的復興。包車和人力東是祇受人力影響的，主人有能力長此喂得飽包車夫的肚子，他也就長此可以站在「安步當車」之　以外，但到底這是少數；坐人力車從望平街到跑馬廳至少要五角，依此類推，所費足可乘坐以前的出差汽車。想來謀節約的人一定很多，而毅然實行安步當車，於是人力車平陛一級，而將爲不置包車而且不願安步當車者所垂靑。</p>
<p>「安步當車」於健康有益是不成問題的，省却一筆可觀的車資，也是顯見的事實，時代叫大家吃苦，大家就練練脚勁吧。</p>

<h3>茶（五）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>唐朝在公元八世紀中葉安史倡亂以後，又是回　和吐蕃交相入侵的時期，他們因為和中國接　頻繁了，也逐漸漬染華風，學會了飲茶。在唐書陸羽傅上就明明的說：「時回　入朝，始　馬市茶。」康李　國史補上也記載着一條說：「常魯公使西蕃，烹茶賬中。贊普—吐蕃王—問曰：「此爲何物？魯公曰；滌煩療渴，所謂茶也。」贊普曰：「我亦有此！」遂命出之，以指曰：「此壽州者，此舒州者，此顧渚者。…」這兩條可以看作飲茶的風俗已竟傳到西域和西藏的鐵證。至於那時的高麗和安南，完全是中國的郡縣，想情度理，這種風氣也應該自然而然的傳人；然而宋史占城國—今安南南部—傳上却明明說「地不產茶；或者從反面上看，我們也可以把它常成已竟「有茶」的證據了吃？蓋所謂「不產」者，乃由他處輸入之謂也：不然者，何必記？至於鷄林類事記朝鮮方言曰：「茶，曰茶。」却是已竟有茶的鐵證了。</p>
<p>我國唐宋時代，又是和大食帝國的阿刺伯人與波斯人交通頻繁的時期。我國在廣州，泉州，杭州等處，設立「市舶提舉司」以管理和他們通商的事宜。他們遠涉重洋的　集我國，其數量是很爲可觀的。　如安史亂時，田神功屠揚州，胡商死的有幾千人。唐末胡商留居　州的有十幾萬人，而且他們住的地方如今現在的租界一樣，特稱爲「蕃坊」。想起來飲茶這種日常的舉動，他們絕不能視若無諸而不也沾染成習的。可是我國茶葉果否此時已竟遠輸到亞洲西部呢？却苦於在我國載籍上沒有法子證明，或謂在公元九世紀中葉，有一個回敎商人名叫蘇利曼的，在所作遊記中已竟提到中國人飲茶，可是他究竟是否把茶傳到西燕，還是疑問哩！</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>漫談香港的游藝</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>香港在這一次的太平洋戰爭中，成了一個衝要的據點，在香港關於游藝方面的情形如何，當然也値得爲讀者報導一下的。</p>
<p>香港的居民約一百五十萬，內中雖大半是貧民，但富人也是不少。尤其自中日戰爭後，從中國各地洮到香港去的，多半是有錢人。有了錢，當然要尋找娛樂，所以在太平洋戰爭未爆發前，香港正和上海一樣，所有的娛樂事業，如雷影院，劇塲等，每一家都吿客滿，熱鬧的情形，可以說香港有史以來從未見過。</p>
<p>香港是國際性的一個島市，各國的僑民都有，因此，經常所表演的音樂，戲劇，也帶有國際性的，所以各國特有的音樂，或離奇的戲劇，在香港都有表演。據說自戰事爆發後，香港雖迭遭空襲，但居民仍保持鎭靜，甚至空襲過後，抱樂觀的人，依舊往電影院去觀看影片，以作消遣呢！</p>
<p>就電影說來，香港各大影院，公映的影片，也全是西片，當然大半也是好萊塢出品。但爲了香港的一百五十萬居民中，華人佔百分之九十八，所以國產影片，歷來在香港亦佔有相當的市塲。自太平洋戰爭爆發後，港滬交通斷絕，此後上海所製的國片，將無法運往香港公映，這在國產影片，當然也是一個莫大的打擊呢！</p>
<h3>觀「孤島男女」</h3>
<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>「孤島男女」一劇顧名思義必然是表現戰後上海的形形色色，在這一點上，這劇不僅給孤島作了一般暴露，而目也盡了深入地剖析的能事；它比「愁城記」不同之處，也就是「愁城記」雖然有一支很明顯的主綫，而巨富於戲劇性，但在表現孤島這點，則祇是膚淺的浮面，遠不及「孤島男女」那樣深切現實，這也許是兩位作者所處空間不同的關係，一切文學作品離不開作者的生活經歷和體騐，我看「孤島男女」能够倍覺親切有味，大約是因爲劇作者和我同樣是多年困居孤島之故？</p>
<p>「孤島男女」的主題是對一切被迷眩於孤島現實環境中的男女，都予以自新之路；它所叙寫的如做許多不正當營業的商人，銷沉的敎授，墮洛的學生等，都表出不是各人的本願，而是某種惡勢力的誘惑和環境壓迫，所以依作者的啓示，在這個環境中將無可作爲，一切人力財力，惟有內移，才是正路。</p>
<p>導演的手法有不凡之處，舞嘉裝置第一三兩幕用雙層式不僅美觀，也能打破許多時裝劇舞臺裝置的陳套；第二幕的大飯店經理室還不够堂皇，尤其是兩側平民向內斜成八字形，不大台理。演員除張李氏一角處理得不够明確外，其餘各人的個性都很具型，使各人都利用許多小動作，爲全劇生色不少。演員極勻稱，全體能認眞努力，上官雲珠飾演劉湘君一角，更能給人以深刻的印象。</p>
<h3>取消開鑼戲</h3>

<p>第二十章　蠟炷迎來在戰塲</p>
<p>他們四人且喝且談，直至黃昏。許靖柳隱英因要早婦營房，所以辭去，依然跨馬而歸。當二人行至途中時，見那一條　　較為冷僻，又沒有街燈，十分黑暗。但是天上有一鈎淡月，在雲層　時現時隱，稀朗朗幾顆小星，風吹得很大，越顯得夜景黯淡。聽得在那衢衕裏有打門叫囂的聲音，二人用夜眼瞧去時，見有三四個淸兵，正打開一家人家進去。柳隱央在馬鞍上向許靖說道：「攝政王自稱軍有紀律，不擾良民。靖哥，方纔我們出來時，瞧見許多淸兵有的整隊遊行，有的縱轡疾馳，神采飛揚，意高氣傲，自以爲關東的健兒，氣蓋一世，瞧在眼裏，實在令人有些氣悶。現在你看他們不是也要背着將帥做出那些狗盜的行爲，和流寇何異？小第旣然撞着了，却不肯饒恕他們。不如隨他们進去瞧個究竟何如？」許靖今晚多喝了些酒，也不怕多事，點頭說一聲好。二人立即跳下馬來，各按着腰下實劍，躡足追蹤而入。裏面是一個很寬敞的庭院，有些化木的影子。朝外一排三開間的半屋，左首一間隱隱有黯淡的燈光，透露在窓紙上，其時那幾個淸兵早已如狼如虎的撲進那間屋子去，只聽裏面有女千慘呼的聲音。二人忙跟至門邊，站在黑暗裏，向室中看時，只見有一個一十多歲的少婦，正跪在地上向淸兵哀求。雖然蓬頭粗服，不加膏沐，也有數分姿色。（二四三）</p>

<h3>Portuguese Government Announces Austro-Dutch Troops Occupy Timor, Portuguese Cabinet Convenes to Discuss Response, External Statement: Macao Remains Peaceful</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Lisbon, 17th – The Portuguese government issued a public statement today, stating, "It is understood that a serious incident has occurred on our colony of Timor Island (near the Dutch East Indies). The cabinet held a special meeting at the Palácio de São Bento to discuss it. The government has decided on the attitude it should adopt towards this matter, but does not intend to announce anything further before obtaining a detailed report."</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 18th – The Portuguese government announced last night that Australian and Dutch East Indies troops had invaded Portuguese Timor Island in the East Indies. The Portuguese government convened an emergency meeting at 5 pm yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Although precise details are not yet available, the Portuguese government believes it must inform the public of the invasion. Furthermore, the Timor radio station has ceased broadcasting.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th – The Dutch government announced that Allied forces have landed in Portuguese Timor. The Allied forces entering Timor will withdraw from the area as soon as the situation permits or the emergency ends.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 18th – According to Reuters, a Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the Allied forces encountered no resistance when landing in Portuguese Timor.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 18th – The occupation of Portuguese Timor Island by Australian and Dutch troops has once again focused world attention on the island. It has an area of 7,500 square miles and a population of approximately 464,000, mostly natives. Its capital is Dili. Its main exports are coffee, copra, wax, and sandalwood. Given the island's important military position, the British government protested to Portugal when Portugal allowed Japanese airlines to establish air routes.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 18th – The Portuguese people were satisfied yesterday with the German spokesperson's statement that rumors of German-Portuguese tensions were spread by certain individuals. It is expected that the authorities here will adopt strict measures to crack down on terrorists. The Diário de Notícias reported that the authorities are closely monitoring the development of the war and its impact on Portugal. The newspaper warned the people not to listen to rumors and to unite in support of the government.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Lisbon, 17th – Rumors that Japanese troops had occupied Portuguese Macao were formally denied by the Portuguese Foreign Ministry, which stated that the news was absolutely unfounded. At the same time, "A República" also reported that a certain foreign broadcasting station had spread rumors yesterday that Macao, near Hong Kong, had been occupied by Japanese troops, and that Major Teixeira had been captured. According to official sources, these rumors are completely unfounded. The situation in Macao is peaceful and normal. The Navy Department received its regular report from the flagship stationed in the Far East this morning, which made no mention of any changes. Furthermore, telegraphic communication between our government and the Governor of Macao has not been interrupted, sufficient to show the above rumors are groundless. Moreover, under the current circumstances, Portuguese-Japanese relations are normal and there is no cause for concern.</p>
<h3>British Troops Retreat South from Kedah, Hong Kong Still Under Artillery Fire, German Aircraft Spotted in Penang, Thailand</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Singapore, 18th – The British Far East Command Headquarters issued a battle report today: "Last night, our troops safely retreated from the south of Kedah and Province Wellesley to a new position south of Sungai Krian. There was fighting near Kulim yesterday, but there was no activity today."</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 18th – Responsible sources here have stated that after the British retreat to the south bank of the Sungai Krian River, the threat to Penang has increased.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 17th – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that a German Dornier Do 24 flying boat was spotted in Thailand and Penang.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Singapore, 17th – Reuters has reported that British troops on the front lines in Kedah, Malaya, have been fighting hard for seven days without rest. A large number of reinforcements have now arrived and will be sent to the rear. These reinforcements are well-equipped, and it is hoped that British troops will be able to prevent Japanese mechanized units from continuing to advance along the road from Kedah.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Singapore, 17th – According to reports from Reuters war correspondents, the Japanese tactics in the Kedah region of the Malay Peninsula involve using mechanized units as the vanguard and tank columns as the rearguard, advancing along roads and through jungle areas. The mechanized units are supported by dive bombers and fast aircraft. Once they break through a British position, they take advantage of the momentum to advance several miles, then stop and build defensive fortifications on the spot. Meanwhile, Japanese infantry trained in forest warfare pass through the jungle in a fan shape on both sides of the road, advancing to the fortified positions established by the mechanized units. By the time the objective is reached, the Japanese positions have become more secure. The mechanized units then advance along the road again, and the infantry repeat the process, passing through the jungle. The Japanese troops operating in this area mostly use handheld machine guns. This Japanese strategy is extremely fierce, and it is difficult for the defending forces to resist unless they have air superiority. As for the Kelantan area, the Japanese offensive has come to a standstill, and their main force is concentrated in the Kedah area, with the appearance of attempting to seize Penang.</p>

<h3>Battles Intensifying in the Philippines, US Reinforces Midway and Wake Islands, Hawaiian Defense Commander Replaced</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th – A Reuters military analyst published the following analysis: The war in the Far East continues to spread. Besieged Hong Kong is now engaged in an unforgettable war. Fierce fighting is taking place in the rice paddies and jungles of Malaya. Battles in the Philippines are intensifying. Japanese troops have landed in Sarawak (i.e., North Borneo). On the Malayan front, the performance of Japanese bomber squadrons appears to be superior to that of fighter squadrons. As a result, the large number of Japanese aircraft has forced the British Air Force to undertake arduous tasks. The British airfields suffered heavy losses during the recent Japanese attacks from their bases in Thailand. However, the British Air Force's counterattacks against the Japanese are now more successful than initially. The valiant fighting on the Philippine Islands is noteworthy. Japanese attempts to land at Lingayen Gulf in 150 small boats have failed. The Japanese aims in attacking Johnston Island and Maui Island in the Hawaiian Islands appear to be to make it difficult for the United States to pinpoint the location of the Japanese fleet. The US military is reinforcing Midway and Wake Islands.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 18th – Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that Lieutenant General Emmons arrived in Honolulu today to succeed General Short as commander of the Hawaiian defenses.

Regarding Burma, the news of the Japanese occupation of Victoria Airfield on Sunday has been confirmed. In addition, Japanese troops have landed in the areas of Myitkyina and Shingbwiyang and dispersed the British mechanized units. The Japanese Air Force has inflicted heavy damage on the US Air Force in the Philippines over the past few days, greatly weakening the US Air Force's resistance. Although the weather in Burma and Malaya is extremely bad, the Japanese Air Force is still quite active.</p>

The investigative committee was only appointed by President Roosevelt yesterday.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Manila, 17th – Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, told reporters that the US defense plan, apart from minor adjustments, remains largely unchanged. In fact, we have never had any offensive plans.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Stockholm, 18th – According to Washington, authoritative sources in naval circles stated yesterday that the US Pacific Fleet will not relinquish its primary task of protecting American interests in the Pacific region.

<h3>French Ship Normandie Requisitioned by US, Compensation to Be Paid</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 17th – The French ocean liner "Normandie," moored in New York harbor, has been requisitioned by the United States. This has been officially confirmed. Responsible sources here stated that this action by the US authorities is completely different in spirit from the measures taken by Britain when it detained French ships. The United States will certainly provide fair compensation to France, but the nature of this compensation is currently unknown. According to information, the De Gaullists have long been urging the United States to seize this large ocean liner. The ship has likely been converted to use De Gaullist sailors. The ship's captain has repeatedly protested about this in American newspapers. However, this ocean liner cannot sail unless it continues to use its original sailors, as it is not a regular ship and is a masterpiece of French industry. As for the other French ships moored in American ports, they have not yet been requisitioned.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Vichy, 18th – The ship has a displacement of 83,423 tons, a length of 293 meters, a width of 36 meters, a maximum speed of 31.5 knots, and an average of 28.5 knots.

After the ship's engineers refused to work, American engineers spent several months studying how to operate the ship. It is widely believed that the US authorities will use the ship as a troop transport.</p>

<p>Haitong Agency, Madrid, 18th – Spanish newspapers have not carried news from London for several days. Yesterday they continued to publish it, but it was much delayed and had been edited by British censors. It is said that after discussions with the United States, the British government decided not to ask the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan, but only to provide assistance to the Soviet Union in its war against Germany. The British War Cabinet believes that Germany remains the main enemy and that the Soviet front is the most vulnerable point of attack. People in London believe that the war has entered a decisive stage and that the war will become more intense and prolonged. Roosevelt and his confidants have been proclaiming a ten-year war. The United States has now adopted the various measures of Britain, with all sectors of national life being prioritized by the state, no longer maintaining a standard of luxury and comfort. Factories work seven days a week, and activities that are not directly related to national defense are restricted. Waste paper, scrap iron, and aluminum are being collected. The limits on British clothing coupons continue to decrease, and restrictions on food will also be tightened, as shipping is decreasing.</p>

<h3>Turkish-Bulgarian Relations Gradually Tense, Turkey Takes Important Measures</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Budapest, 17th – Diplomatic circles here are closely watching developments in relations between Bulgaria and Turkey. Although it cannot be said that relations between the two countries have become tense, it is safe to say that they are not as friendly as usual. Turkish newspapers have expressed anger and discontent towards Bulgaria. The Turkish government has also taken important measures, suspending passenger trains and extending the length of compulsory military service. The reason for this is that Bulgaria has taken the position of a belligerent, which has caused deep dissatisfaction in Turkey. In short, relations between Turkey and Bulgaria are unlikely to deteriorate, but it is also not an exaggeration to say that they are strained. Under the current circumstances, it is difficult for Bulgarian troops to attack the Dardanelles Strait. Even if they had the intention, it is not the right time.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Sofia, 17th – The cabinet meeting recently decided that all businesses engaged in the grain and bean trade should be mobilized and authorized the Ministry of the Army to requisition privately held cotton.

<h3>Import of Foreign Rice Continues; Warehouses Gradually Being Opened; Rice Shops Extracted Rice Stored in Warehouses Yesterday; Food Situation Expected to Ease; Bread Factories' Suspension of Work Being Resolved Through Consultation</h3>
<p>It has been learned that after the Japanese side announced that all stockpiles in the city, except for those of a military nature, would be available for public use, the opening of food warehouses began yesterday (the 17th) afternoon. Among those already opened are three or four warehouses storing large quantities of rice flour. An official also predicted that more warehouses would be opened daily.</p>
<p>Gradual Progress in Food Relief</p>
<p>The Municipal Council is quickly allocating large quantities of imported foreign rice to various retail rice shops, and the number of citizens queuing to buy Municipal Council rice in front of the rice shops has begun to decrease. Municipal Council personnel also expect that from tomorrow (the 19th) onwards, the crowds for Municipal Council rice will gradually disappear. Citizens can expect to receive more food relief in the near future, as it is expected that the Japanese authorities will continue to open various warehouses today. A Municipal Council official said that the negotiations between the Council and the Japanese authorities regarding the opening of food warehouses are progressing satisfactorily. It is said that the Japanese side has allowed the reopening of flour warehouses to meet civilian needs.</p>
<p>Designated Warehouses to Extract Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council to various rice shops for retail sale, which had previously been issued with manual permits designating extraction from the Xiamen Road Xinyuan Warehouse, has already been extracted by the rice shops separately. It can be generally sold today, with the quantity still limited to three sheng per person, equivalent to four yuan in national currency. Yesterday, rice shops continued to carry funds to the Foreign Rice Office to apply for the extraction of foreign rice sealed in various warehouses. A large number of people were involved. The office first issued number plates in the lower-level courtyard, and then, in order, they went upstairs, submitted payments, filled out forms, and applied. The office continued to issue transport permits, designating the Maotai Warehouse on Baker Road and the Maotai Warehouse on Dahua Road as the two warehouses for extraction, so that the rice shops could continue to handle door-to-door retail sales. The rice shops' previous attempt to extract sealed foreign rice from the Taikoo Warehouse had not been successful due to pending formalities, but extraction was possible yesterday. The Municipal Council's Foreign Rice Office has allocated the foreign rice of several rice shops to be extracted from the Taikoo Warehouse. Therefore, the situation regarding the retail rice problem in this port is easing due to the Municipal Council's continuous allocation and supply.</p>
<h3>Imported Foreign Rice Prices Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that, starting from the 19th of this month, the Municipal Council's selling price of imported foreign rice to rice shops will be changed to 162 yuan in national currency per 224 pounds (total weight out of the warehouse). At the same time, the maximum retail price will be changed to 4 yuan and 1 jiao in national currency per three sheng.</p>
<p>Rice Purchasing to be Stamped with Chemical Seal</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Municipal Council, in view of the congestion of rice purchasers at various retail rice shops, where some people inevitably purchase rice multiple times continuously, causing hardship for the elderly and weak rice purchasers and disrupting the balance between supply and demand, has decided that within days, the Municipal Council will issue to each rice shop a seal and a type of chemical dye. This type of seal, stamped on the palm of each retail purchaser, has a chemical effect and will automatically disappear after 24 hours. This will prevent the aforementioned malpractices.</p>
<p>Relief and Food Distribution Continue Unabated</p>
<p>The United Charity Association is finding the refugee feeding problem very difficult. The association houses more than 5,000 refugees. Although one meal of rice and one meal of porridge has been changed to two meals of porridge per day, the existing food supply is only enough for ten days. Yesterday, the Municipal Council approved the transport of more than 170 bags of foreign rice from sealed warehouses. This foreign rice should be available today, temporarily resolving the refugee feeding problem. At the request of its members, the Sanjiao Daode Shanyi Association purchased a large quantity of foreign rice from the Public Concession Municipal Council to organize rice purchasing for its members. All members of the association can apply for registration (the quantity supplied depends on the number of people). Registration began yesterday, and purchases were very enthusiastic. As for the work of distributing food to street refugees, 20 porridge shops in the two concessions are still entrusted to issue porridge and clothing vouchers. Sincere and New Sincere companies are selling them on behalf of the association, with a price of 13 yuan in national currency per set. The association's office is located at 14, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone number 91067.</p>
<p>Bread Manufacturers Suddenly Stop Production</p>
<p>After the Municipal Council set a price limit on bread, various Chinese bread manufacturers suddenly stopped manufacturing bread yesterday. In addition, foreign-owned bakeries in the two concessions are also slowing down their work due to a shortage of flour and concerns about future supplies. However, this difficult situation is expected to be overcome immediately, as the Japanese authorities have begun to open food warehouses, and the Concession authorities are also stepping up the allocation of flour for public consumption. It is reported that representatives of bread manufacturers and the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday to seek solutions and obtain the cooperation of the French Concession authorities. It is said that Chinese bread manufacturers have made considerable profits in the past and should cooperate with the public during this difficult time. However, the bread manufacturers said that their flour was purchased before the Concession authorities set price limits on flour and bread, so the cost is quite high. If they sell it at the current bread price limit, they will inevitably lose money. According to a Municipal Council official, the bread price limit is very fair, and if the bread manufacturers insist on their position, "we will undoubtedly impose sanctions."</p>
<h3>Attention Purchasers of Rice</h3>
<p>Reporters have witnessed in recent days that a very small number of rice shops are continuing to sell foreign rice to maintain the food supply, and the number of people queuing to buy rice, men, women, old and young, is constantly over a thousand. This kind of crowding is unprecedented. In order to prevent accidents, the police authorities recently ordered that children under the age of fourteen are not allowed to buy rice. In fact, elderly men and women and those who are weak and physically unable to bear the squeezing should not participate in rice purchasing to avoid accidents. According to witnesses yesterday, a young pregnant woman was injured in the abdomen while buying rice, resulting in a hemorrhage and death. If this is true, it is a great tragedy.</p>
<h3>Briquette Factory Door Sales Department Selling Hours Divided Into Two Sessions, Morning and Afternoon</h3>
<p>In addition to continuing to supply each small factory with one ton of briquettes daily to meet retail needs, large factories such as Yitaixing and Nanyang Jinghua are also continuing to sell briquettes at the temporary door sales departments set up in the factories. The Municipal Council has recently stipulated that the selling hours are from 7:30 AM to 11:00 AM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The retail limit at the temporary door sales departments of the major factories remains half a dan (i.e., 50 jin), with a price of 20 yuan per dan. The retail limit for each small factory remains 2 yuan per person (i.e., 10 jin). The gathering of civilians purchasing briquettes at the door sales departments of factories such as Yitaixing has become less crowded than in previous days. The stock of coal dust at the factories is still plentiful, and the supply should not be lacking.</p>
<h3>After Limiting Electricity Consumption, Residents Automatically Reduce the Number of Lamps to Save Electricity</h3>
<p>Due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, the French Concession authorities have implemented measures to conserve electricity supply, closing the traffic control lights on various roads and reducing the number and brightness of streetlights. Therefore, red and green lights are no longer seen in the French Concession in recent days, and traffic is controlled by police officers. The reduced number and brightness of streetlights on various roads at night have resulted in a dim appearance, a far cry from the dazzling brightness of the past. The French Concession authorities have now ordered the residents of various lanes and alleys in the Concession to reduce the number of lamps. This measure has been implemented since the 10th of this month, and the French-owned Tramway and Electric Lighting Company has issued a notice in various newspapers as follows: "This company hereby once again informs all electricity users that new restrictions on the use of electricity are effective from December 10, 1941. From this date, each user must not exceed 80% of their monthly average electricity consumption. Violators will be penalized (surcharge and suspension of electricity supply)." Therefore, residents should automatically save electricity, reduce the number of lamps, and fully cooperate with the authorities.</p>
<h3>Registration of Two Types of Goods</h3>
<p>Wheat Bran</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that all businesses, organizations, and individuals in the port who have more than one week's worth of wheat bran for their own use must register with the Council's Office No. 703 before 12:00 noon on the 20th of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be confiscated without compensation. Furthermore, starting from the 19th of this month, all types of wheat bran will not be allowed to be transported within or out of the Public Concession without a permit. Transport permits can be obtained from the Council's Business Association.</p>
<p>Fats</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that all those who have local or imported animal and vegetable tallows and palm oil must register with the Council. Factories that use the aforementioned materials must also register their existing and required quantities. Registration must be completed before 4:00 PM on the 24th of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be confiscated without compensation. Registration forms can be obtained from the Council's Business Association playground (entrance and exit at Fuzhou Road). Until further notice, all of the aforementioned materials will not be allowed to be transported without a permit. Transport permits can be obtained from the aforementioned address.</p>
<h3>Starting from 9:00 AM Next Monday, Private Cars Will Not Be Allowed to Drive</h3>
<p>Vehicles Necessary for Business Are Still Allowed, but Permits Must Be Obtained Within 24 Hours</p>
<p>According to a Municipal Council notice, in view of the limited gasoline reserves in the port, the Council, with the consent of the French Concession authorities, has decided that starting from 9:00 AM on Monday, the 22nd of this month, all private cars will not be allowed to drive in the Public Concession, except for those in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>A small number of vehicles belonging to physicians and obstetricians, to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Trucks, etc., transporting essential goods and issued with transport permits.</p>
<p>Permits Are Valid in Both Concessions</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to use a car in any of the above circumstances (except for the fifth) should apply for a permit from the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road within 24 hours and prove their need. The vehicle permit will be issued by the Transport Permit Office of the Council's Head Office, Office No. 29, but the corresponding transport permit must be presented. A permit valid in the Public Concession is valid in the French Concession, and a permit valid in the French Concession is also valid in the Public Concession. The above measures do not affect various vehicles that do not use gasoline or diesel.</p>
<p>The Authorities Intend to Purchase Gasoline</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the Council is willing to purchase the gasoline inventories of car owners at a price of 5.20 yuan per gallon. These inventories should be used for essential services. Those who have previously unreported inventories and can sell them to the Council immediately will be exempted from penalties. Applications for reporting the location and container of the inventories should be submitted to the Transport Office, Office No. 36 of the Council for verification.</p>
<h3>Method for Chinese Banks to Withdraw Deposits from HSBC; All Transactions Handled Through the Yokohama Specie Bank</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Japanese side has allowed Chinese banks in the port to withdraw deposits previously stored in foreign banks such as HSBC, but before withdrawal, the purpose must be clearly stated. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Japanese side's method for withdrawing these deposits is that foreign banks must first open an account with the Yokohama Specie Bank for transactions, and then Chinese banks can withdraw from the Yokohama Specie Bank. It is also heard that this matter has been largely determined and will be implemented within days.</p>
<p>Safes Still Not Opened</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, the safes of various foreign banks were still not opened yesterday. Therefore, Chinese and foreign people waiting at various foreign banks to withdraw their belongings were disappointed to learn that they were still not open and returned home dejectedly. The business hours of various foreign banks remain from 10:00 AM to 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Salaries of Foreign Bank Employees</p>
<p>As for the salaries issued by various foreign banks since the 8th of this month, it is stipulated that, regardless of nationality or rank, each person will receive 20 yuan per day from Monday to Saturday, amounting to 500 yuan per month per person.</p>

<p>Statement by the Chief of the Japanese Military Press Section</p>
<p>Regarding the announcement of the declaration of important materials, the chief of the press section of the Japanese Army and Navy issued the following statement yesterday: "The purpose of the announcement regarding important materials issued by the Supreme Command of the Japanese military in Shanghai is nothing more than to prevent the dispersion of important materials and to clarify their location, so that the goods can be used most effectively and to provide the longest possible supply to the general public. The Japanese military will handle a portion of the declared materials in the most appropriate way in accordance with international law. However, for other materials, in order to maintain the livelihood of the general public in Shanghai, the appropriate agencies will supply the needs of the general public in a fair and effective manner. Furthermore, the Japanese military will compensate the owners of the goods purchased by the Japanese military with a fair and appropriate price. Furthermore, if the enemy country does not confiscate the private property of our people, the Japanese military will never resort to uncompensated confiscation of the private property of the enemy country. Therefore, we hope that the general public will not be alarmed and will implement the telegraph in the fastest and most accurate way. Those who intentionally delay the declaration, or who know of someone intentionally delaying the declaration and fail to report the facts to the Japanese Military Police, or who falsely accuse the facts, will be severely punished. The points to be noted by the declarers are as follows: 1. Declaration forms can be obtained from the branch office of the Japanese Consulate General located in the Yokohama Specie Bank Building, 24 Bund. 2. Declaration acceptance will begin on December 19 at the branch office, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. 3. All people, regardless of nationality, must declare. 4. This announcement is completely different from the announcement regarding the transfer of real estate issued on December 8. 5. Special attention should be paid to the points recorded on the declaration form as follows: (A) Record according to the type of material on separate sheets (for example, when the same declarant declares copper, automobiles, and aspirin (Western medicine), three separate sheets should be used). (B) The location of the materials should be recorded in the most detail (that is, the location where the materials are stored, street name, lane number, warehouse number, etc., must be recorded).</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The following table lists the average retail prices of commodities from November 16 to December 15. This price table was compiled by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>British Interests Entrusted to Swiss Consul-General</h3>
<p>The Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Fundary, has been entrusted to manage British interests in Shanghai and in areas occupied by the Japanese military in China. The location for handling the aforementioned British interests will be announced separately in the newspapers in the near future. All British nationals can apply to the office for protection at that time.</p>
<h3>Post Office Branch Business Hours Close at 7:00 PM</h3>
<p>According to a post office announcement, effective immediately, the business hours of all branch offices will close at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Survey of Foreign Ships in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The foreign ships currently berthed in the Huangpu River include the French ships Grand Dadenam and Averini, the Italian ship Conte Verde, the German ship Berliikon, and the Portuguese ship Berreto, as well as four Panamanian ships. The Russian ship S.S. TYmlat is berthed at buoys 27 and 28. The British ship New Beijing was captured by the Navy on the 16th and brought to Shanghai, and is now berthed at buoys 14 and 15. There are more than ten Italian ships berthed in the South Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Industry</h3>
<p>— Xiang Gu</p>
<p>When the Shanghai war broke out, Shanghai's entertainment industry, though briefly paused, quickly rebounded; even flourishing more than before the war due to the abnormal development of society. New movie theaters and dance halls were built in every corner. The fees for performers from the north were higher than the price of a dan (unit of weight) of rice. Even the "Yangzhou New Opera" and "Elegant Yue Opera," always looked down upon by Shanghainese, occupied the top spots in the entertainment scene... In these four years, the Shanghainese indulged in extravagant pleasures to the extreme.</p>
<p>Now, the Far East war has broken out again. The general population continues to queue for rice and coal briquettes as before, but the other class of people, steeped in the pleasures of entertainment, is also facing unprecedented difficulties. They too have begun practicing the long snake formation in front of banks. It is natural to expect that the entertainment industry they supported would plummet as a result. However, the evolution of objective circumstances is an even greater blow to the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>On the surface: streetcars and buses return to the depot early, before 9 PM. Privately owned cars are "frozen" due to gasoline rationing. The engine of the nightlife naturally stops running. Although the last showing at first-run movie theaters is moved up an hour, the audience is limited to nearby residents. Peking opera theaters have switched to daytime performances, and dance halls can only maintain their peak for two or three hours, a new record since their inception.</p>
<p>As for the underlying crisis, in the near future, even this reduced entertainment industry may not be able to sustain itself. According to unofficial statistics, there are about 200 Western films that have arrived in Shanghai but have not yet been released. Due to environmental factors, it is feared that more than half of them cannot be released. Newspaper reports state that the Asia Theater claims that first-run Western films will also adopt the rotation system used for second-run Western films. The panic about available films is imaginable. Domestic film companies are still working, but the source of film stock has been cut off. How long can Shanghai's "inventory" last? Moreover, the largest market for domestic films - Southeast Asia - is engulfed in the sound of gunfire!</p>
<p>The problem of "people" for Peking opera theaters naturally doesn't exist. Even if prominent performers don't come down, southern opera singers who can hold their own are all concentrated in Shanghai. However, the regular expenses of Peking opera are quite large, the most basic being around 3,000 yuan per day. Now that they have switched to daytime performances, they have invisibly lost two daytime performances every weekend. It is difficult for each theater to have 2,000 spectators every day to maintain this situation.</p>
<p>Then, are amusement parks with "buy one get one free" tickets and third- and fourth-run movie theaters with ticket prices of three or four jiao (cents) "targets of public criticism"? With the closure of foreign firms and factories, hundreds of thousands of workers are struggling on the brink of starvation. Even a few mao (cents) are probably precious now.</p>
<h3>Yang Fukang Attacked</h3>
<p>Local resident Yang Fukang, who works at the post office, was walking near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Beijing Road at around 6 PM last night when a person lying in ambush on the side of the road suddenly splashed nitric acid on his face from a bottle, causing him to lose sight in one eye. In pain, he collapsed to the ground. The perpetrator took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The injured person was carried to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Gasoline Hidden in Ditch Explodes, Injuring People; Eight Feces Boats Affected; Police Investigate Perpetrator Who Stored Gasoline</h3>
<p>In the gutter in front of the Tongrentang Chinese pharmacy at 445 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, someone recently hid a large amount of illicit gasoline. Unexpectedly, at around 8:10 AM yesterday, the gasoline suddenly ignited in the gutter, causing thick smoke and the smell of oil to rise from all the nearby gutters. The gutter in front of the pharmacy was particularly severe. With a loud bang, the concrete brick cover of the gutter was shattered, scattering debris and injuring Gu Keming (26 years old, resident of Lane 5, No. 432 Xujiahui Road) from Nanhui in the head, a child named Wang Asan (10 years old) from Jiangbei in the leg, and Yao Yangshi (42 years old), a woman on a feces boat docked by the bank, in the face. At the same time, the gasoline in the gutter was burning fiercely, with sparks flying everywhere, causing partial damage to eight feces boats docked at the shore. Upon receiving the news, the French police and fire brigade dispatched a large number of detectives and fire trucks to extinguish the fire and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. The police are currently rigorously investigating the principal offender who hid the gasoline and caused the accident.</p>
<h3>Check and Rice Distribution Voucher Found, Returned to Owner; Returning Lost Items is Admirable</h3>
<p>A Mr. Wang, who works at the Dadong Rice Store at 94 Baliqiao Street in the French Concession, was walking near the Catholic Church on Avenue Edward VII the other day when he lost a letter bag containing two checks from the Dazhong Bank, totaling 38,600 yuan in national currency, and a rice distribution voucher. Wang was alarmed and searched everywhere, but could not find it. He had no choice but to return to the store and report the loss truthfully. He also urgently notified the Dazhong Bank to stop payment. Fortunately, a gentleman who found the letter bag personally delivered it to the Dazhong Bank half an hour later and returned the items to the owner. This gentleman's act of returning lost items is admirable and worthy of special recognition.</p>
<h3>French Police Search Dunhe Lane</h3>
<p>The French police, led by Chinese and Western detectives, were ordered to search house by house in Dunhe Lane at the intersection of Route du Consulat and Route Remi at around 8 AM yesterday, cutting off traffic until around 10 AM. The result was nothing found.</p>
<h3>Gambling Debt Confession</h3>
<p>Yu Zhengui from Changzhou, resident of No. 1060 Maba Road, Xiaoshadu Road, was working as a debt collector at the American Haiduo Foreign Firm at 51 Guangdong Road. On the 13th of this month, he was ordered to go out to collect debts, totaling 1,100 yuan. Yu took the money to a gambling den in Nanshi and gambled wildly, spending all the money. Unable to report back, he surrendered himself to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation, the detectives confirmed the facts, and Yu was taken into custody to be sent to court for questioning in the future.</p>
<h3>Robbery Notes</h3>
<p>At 7 AM yesterday, four thieves broke into a household at No. 6, Lane 357, Tianjin Road. The thieves first locked the rear residents in a room, guarded by two thieves who strictly forbade them from making noise. Meanwhile, the other two thieves coerced the head of the household to point out the location of the valuables. As a result, they stole cash and valuables worth 10,000 yuan and fled. By the time the Laozha Police detectives arrived after hearing the alarm, the thieves had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Five robbers broke into No. 9, Lane 501, Route Tenant de la Tour, at around 6 PM last night. Two of them were armed. They robbed jewelry, estimated to be worth 1,000 yuan, and fled without a trace.</p>
<h3>List of Post Offices Handling Parcels in Hangzhou Area</h3>
<p>The Post Office hereby lists the names of the bureaus in the Hangzhou Administration area of Zhejiang Province that have opened and not opened parcel and small package mail services for reference.

<h3>Fire Accidents Last Month; Sixteen Deaths</h3>
<p>Last month, the Fire Brigade of the Public Works Department received a total of 91 alarms, including two malicious false alarms and six special alarms. The estimated value of property lost due to fires in the Public Concession and areas outside the Shanghai Western border roads was approximately 1,179,405 yuan in national currency. A total of sixteen citizens died in fires, and twenty were injured. A total of three people were injured due to special accidents, and a total of ten fire brigade personnel were injured while fighting fires.</p>
<h3>Pushan Villa Plans to Use Handcarts to Collect Corpses</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa's work of transporting corpses of those who die on the streets of the Public Concession and those unclaimed will also be greatly delayed due to the lack of gasoline. According to an official of the Villa, the Villa has five trucks dedicated to transporting the corpses of those who die on the streets for burial. In the severe winter, the number of corpses that die from freezing increases. Although all the vehicles are dispatched, it is still not enough. Due to the difficulty of gasoline supply, one of the above-mentioned trucks has been suspended since yesterday, with only three departing. In about a week, all of them will be suspended. In the future, the corpses will be transported by hand-pushed carts. At that time, due to the delay in collection and burial work, the time for removing corpses from the streets will be delayed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai United Music Society Charity Concert</h3>
<p>As winter approaches, the number of beggars freezing to death on the streets has increased sharply. In view of this, the Shanghai United Music Society has initiated a charity concert to be held at the Great Shanghai Theater on Yuqiaqing Road at 10 AM on the 26th of this month. Famous Chinese and Western musicians will be invited to perform refined music. Tickets are priced as follows: Honorary tickets at 100 yuan each, regular tickets at 20 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. All major music stores in Shanghai sell tickets. Mr. Feng Shuxun has been specially invited by the Society to host this event. It is expected that the scene will be lively and bustling.</p>
<h3>Shanghai YMCA Christmas Concert Led by Mr. Wu Zhengqian, Starting at 5:30 PM on the 23rd</h3>
<p>The Christmas concert organized by the Shanghai YMCA, originally scheduled to be held at the Grand Auditorium of the YMCA at Baxianqiao at 8 PM on the 23rd of this month, has been moved to 5:30 PM due to traffic conditions. In addition to Mr. Wu himself performing solo, many famous musicians from Shanghai will participate in the performance, such as baritone singer Ge Chaozhi, soprano singer Yu Zhilan, mezzo-soprano singer Pang Jiaju, violinist Cai Keji, cellist Ji Hanwen, pianist Chen Shixi, and flutist Zhang Zhuang. It is said that this performance is purely for the purpose of popularizing music education and celebrating Christmas. Tickets are priced at two yuan and one yuan, and are sold at the YMCA news office. Many people have been buying them recently. Music lovers in Shanghai should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Zhijiang Church Revises Worship Time</h3>
<p>The Zhijiang University Church in this city will hold its Sunday worship service as usual at the Dahua Cinema every Sunday. It is now learned that the worship time will be changed to 10 AM starting from the 21st of this month. This Sunday is a music worship service to celebrate the birth of Christ. In addition to Dr. Ming Side giving a sermon, there will be programs such as a choir, instrumental trio, and solo performances by the church's sacred music group.</p>
<h3>Tongyu Installs Small Electricity Meters</h3>
<p>Since the company authorities stipulated the number of electricity units used by each user, any use of electricity exceeding the stipulated amount will be subject to a fine of 25 times the amount. This restriction is originally intended to save fuel and maintain public utilities, and we should do our best to cooperate. However, if the amount of electricity used by landlords and subtenants is not measured with small electricity meters, it will be impossible to prove their responsibility. Therefore, those who have not installed small electricity meters should quickly entrust Tongyu at 625 Avenue Edward VII to install them to avoid excuses. Those who have installed small electricity meters should save electricity and not exceed their previous usage.</p>
<h3>Swiss Miss Winter Festival Gift Information</h3>
<p>The Swiss Miss Winter Festival New Year's Gift Fair held by the Jiufu Company at the intersection of Peking Road and Boone Road has been going on for more than ten days, and the participation has been very enthusiastic. It is said that anyone who buys Swiss Miss malted milk powder will receive a gift voucher. The prize will be drawn on the 21st of this month according to the numbers on the vouchers. There are a total of 500 prizes, all of which are valuable gifts, with a total value of more than 30,000 yuan. All kinds of gifts are displayed in major companies such as New World Company, Welfare Company, Wing On Company, Parke Davis Company, Zhang Yu Company, etc. The display is colorful and very rich. Swiss Miss is a collection of various nutritional products, with remarkable effectiveness, and deeply meets the needs of all walks of life for winter nourishment. Now, with the addition of valuable gifts, buyers are even more enthusiastic, and the threshold is almost broken.</p>
<p>Life Feature</p>
<h3>Walking as a Carriage</h3>
<p>— Wei Ge</p>
<p>In the past, someone lived in the extra-settlement road area of Shanghai West. Every morning at around 7 AM, he would walk to his office on the banks of the Huangpu River. Those who knew him said he was stupid and expressed disdain. Not enjoying the great modern transportation and moving his two legs, which primitive humans also had, to run such a long distance in a short period of time was indeed an extraordinary act at the time. Who knew that today, due to the impact of the outbreak of the Pacific War, the supply of coal and gasoline has become a serious problem. As a result, buses and trams have shortened their routes and reduced their running time, while taxis have stopped operating a few days ago. Now people still have short-distance trams and buses to ride, but the number has been greatly reduced. Even how long this situation can be maintained is a problem, so widespread walking is inevitable.</p>
<p>Whether you take a bus or a tram, the attitude of the staff in the car has improved a bit. However, the practice of squeezing onto the bus is still very prevalent. These days, because of the shortening of the bus routes and the limitation of the running time, passengers are even more crowded. They still seem to disdain practicing walking and are trying their best to enjoy this limited modern transportation tool. Because of the crowding of passengers, what I have seen and heard in the two buses these days is even more jarring and eye-catching. Naturally, this is the feeling of an observer on the other side of the river. As for those who are directly affected, I believe they will turn their minds to the famous ancient saying "walking as a carriage" and are eager to prepare to implement it.</p>
<p>Private cars will also follow public vehicles and taxis and disappear from the streets. So some people are designing the revival of the horse-drawn carriage industry. Rickshaws and manual carriages are only affected by manpower. If the owner has the ability to feed the rickshaw puller's stomach for a long time, then he can stand outside of "walking as a carriage" for a long time. But after all, this is a minority. Taking a rickshaw from Wangping Street to the racecourse costs at least five jiao. By analogy, the cost is enough to ride the previous taxi. It is expected that there will be many people who want to save money, and they will resolutely implement walking as a carriage. As a result, rickshaws will level up and will be favored by those who do not own carriages and do not want to walk.</p>
<p>"Walking as a carriage" is undoubtedly beneficial to health. Saving a considerable amount of money on transportation is also an obvious fact. The times are asking everyone to suffer, so let's practice our leg strength.</p>

<h3>Three Western YMCA Basketball Games Tonight; Tongren Faces French Army; Yiguang Plays Shanghang; Blue and White Against Lingyou</h3>
<p>There are three Group B games in the Western YMCA basketball tournament tonight. They will be held at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road starting at 6:20 PM. The first game is between Shanghai Bank and Yiguang. Both teams have been defeated by Monac this week. Their strengths are comparable. However, Shanghang once took the lead in the banking industry basketball tournament and should have veterans such as Zhou Jun and Ye Zuyou under his command. Yiguang is ultimately inferior, so it is expected that Shanghang will be able to win. The other game is between Tongren Xu's team and the French Army. Tongren defeated Chengyou 38-17 in the game, starting off well. The French Army has one win and one loss, defeating Lingyou 31-27 and losing to the French Police 18-33. The last game is between Blue and White B and Lingyou, which will also be a fierce battle. In the recent situation of Group B, South China is in the top spot with three wins and no losses. Monac is closely following with one loss and two wins. Tongren and Storm are tied for second place with one win and one loss. The order of play for tonight is: Yiguang - Shanghang (Group B) 6:20 PM Tongren - French Army (Group B) 7:15 PM Blue and White - Lingyou (Group B) 8:15 PM</p>
<p>Order for Monday (22nd): Storm vs. Monac (Group B) 6:20 PM Liangxi vs. Zhongyi (Group A) 7:15 PM</p>

<h3>National Rice Flows Steadily, People's Hearts Gradually Stabilize, Rumors of Government Monopoly on Oil Sales</h3>
<p>Under the principle that national rice can circulate freely, the source of supply was strong yesterday. In addition to vendors carrying rice in bags, wholesale shipments also arrived, totaling nearly 300 dan. Therefore, the national rice market saw a slight rebound. Superior japonica rice continued to sell for 280 yuan, while thin indica rice was priced from 275 yuan to 272 yuan. The general price for street vendors ranged from 26 yuan to 28 yuan per dou (unit of volume), depending on the distance of their transportation. Compared to this, the buying and selling of foreign rice was said to be limited to the opening of small scales for glutinous rice and the like. However, it seems difficult to believe this because the scales at various rice shops have not yet been opened. As for the first batch of 2,500 bags of Pingmi Wujian arriving in Nanshi, they have already been distributed to the rice shops in the area. People crowded around, and the rice was sold out in an instant. It is said that the second batch of 2,500 bags has also arrived, and another 5,000 bags are being loaded onto ships in Wuhu for shipment to Shanghai. The registration procedure for foreign rice in the market is about to be completed. It is said that the scales will be opened for public sale today or tomorrow. It is hoped that there will be a method to facilitate citizens' purchase of rice, so that unscrupulous merchants cannot profit from the rice, and that the good citizens will not be squeezed out and fall into a state of hardship and starvation.</p>
<p>There is no formal market for wheat. Direct delivery to Japanese factories is still around 75 yuan, but this is only a small amount. It will be difficult for flour to develop in the short term. Bran, on the other hand, is being sold by itinerant merchants, who are unwilling to lend. As a result, the market is gradually falling. Yesterday, orchid bran was 54.5 yuan and Sanxin bran was 57 yuan, a decrease of two or three yuan compared to the high prices of the previous days.</p>
<p>Transactions of miscellaneous grains were still sluggish yesterday. There were only a few transactions of each item. The market was unusually quiet. The total market transaction for Jiangbei raw oil was 100 cans, priced at 350 yuan. Rapeseed oil was 238 yuan to 244 yuan. 50 bags of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan were priced at 103 yuan. 60 bags of Chongming sand red were priced at 93 yuan to 92 yuan. 20 bags of sand silkworms were priced at 60 yuan. 100 bags of Saigon new corn were priced at 55.8 yuan. 100 bags of Dutch white corn were priced at 53 yuan. 200 bags of yellow corn were priced at 52 yuan to 51.7 yuan.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Japanese factory has negotiated with the joint-venture boundary and the Japanese military authorities to set the price of raw soybean oil at 260 yuan, and Rong oil and cottonseed oil at 240 yuan, and to monopolize the entire sales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Resumes Today</h3>
<p>All speculative markets will pay attention to this shift. In the Shuangma factory single market, the dark market was slightly relaxed. The opening price on the previous day was 1,935 yuan. Today, it is said that someone is willing to offer 1,900 yuan, but no transaction has been made. The Variable Horse Exchange Office held a meeting to discuss the amount of transactions made by the bulls and bears on the 8th, and the majority agreed to settle the price at 2,190 yuan based on the closing price on the 8th. Unexpectedly, it could not be realized due to the opposition of a part of the people. Recently, the attitude of the bulls has changed, and it is estimated that the price can only be settled at 2,190 yuan. It is also rumored that the Lanfeng Caiqiu Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been scheduled to resume operations normally tomorrow (the 19th) and open for auction as usual. The problem of the Golden Horse Exchange will not be delayed.</p>
<p>The price of cotton in the dark market has not been transacted since the Pacific incident. After the yarn market recovers, the factories may purchase.</p>
<h3>Cash Gold Sold in Large Quantities, Further Decline of 500 Yuan Compared to Previous Day</h3>
<p>The price of cash gold (10 taels) continued to decline sharply. In the early morning, it was 13,850 yuan. Because the silver houses and money exchange shops depreciated and scrambled to sell, it immediately rose to 13,600 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels, and it slightly recovered to 13,650 yuan. Suddenly, the Shicheng Silver House and others sold 60 taels to a certain gold shop, and it immediately fell to 13,550 yuan. The clients of the small money shops and a certain gold shop shouted to sell at a lower price, and the decline was sharp, another step down by 350 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop, the lowest being 13,200 yuan. At noon, buyers offered the above price, and sellers asked for 13,400 yuan. There was still no improvement in the afternoon, and no further transactions were made. The price has fallen to 13,300 yuan, with no buyers, a decrease of 500 yuan compared to the previous day. The Datong and Xintong gold shops still quoted 1,450 yuan for gold jewelry, and the purchase price has been reduced to 1,200 yuan. Silver is still quoted at 20 yuan, and the black market is only 10 yuan at the lowest, then around 12 yuan, with a discount of two yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Remains Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>The price of US dollars remains firm. Around 11 AM, there was a transaction at 20 yuan. Afterwards, there were no buyers, and sellers offered 19.7 yuan. Sellers were still offering 20 yuan, with a premium of 0.2 yuan. Hong Kong notes were slightly lower at 3.57 yuan. The Japanese military note market has not resumed operations, and the over-the-counter price is also unknown because most have temporarily suspended buying and selling.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Inevitably; Ewo Shares Rise Again</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter settlements of government bond transactions are gradually coming to an end, and the number of transactions is decreasing. Yesterday, there were only seven or eight transactions. Type C bonds traded at a high of 60.9 yuan, with only 5,000 transacted, 8 jiao transacted, about 30,000, 7 jiao transacted 120,000, and finally 7 jiao was offered for sale, but there were no takers. Type A bonds were offered for sale at 71 yuan, Type B bonds were offered for sale at 66.8 yuan, and Type E bonds were sold at 63.5 yuan. Buyers only offered 3 yuan, so transactions were scarcer than before. People's hearts are gradually falling, so the twelfth lottery for Type E bonds, which should have been drawn on December 10th, was not held, and there was no statement of postponement. Therefore, the ticket holders suspect what will happen to the twelfth期 principal and interest due at the end of January 31st, and people's hearts are shaken by this. The future is still unknown.</p>
<p>Among foreign shares, Ewo Silk Factory shares rose to 35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Iron Shops in Suzhou Road Area Resumed Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>The metal market was slightly better yesterday than a few days ago. The reason is that yesterday afternoon after 3:00 PM, metal shops around North Suzhou Road were opened and started business. However, only Canadian green lead was transacted, and the number was not large. Compared to the golden age of the past, the market price has fallen by as much as 100 yuan. Yesterday's quoted price ranged from 850 yuan to 900 yuan per dan, with some fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Ingredients and Arrowheads Sluggish</h3>
<p>There has been little recent arrival of medicinal ingredients and arrowheads, but because of the numerous obstacles to delivery, the market is tired and the highest price has fallen by more than 100 yuan. There are still few takers. The current market is quoting more than 200 yuan, but there are still no deals.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Still Suspended</h3>
<p>The sugar market was still suspended yesterday, and the guild could not trade because gatherings were prohibited. Only two hours in the afternoon were used as a venue for the import and export of southern goods, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Squid and Dried Scallops Both Rose</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of Western goods has been cut off, and even Eastern goods are not arriving. Therefore, squid and dried scallops have both risen. Yesterday's market prices for squid were 1,050 yuan, and dried scallops were already 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea (5)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>After the An-Shi Rebellion in the mid-8th century, during the Tang Dynasty, there were also frequent invasions by the Uyghurs and Tibetans. Because of their frequent contact with China, they gradually adopted Chinese customs and learned to drink tea. The Biography of Lu Yu in the Book of Tang clearly states: "At that time, the Uyghurs came to court and began horse markets for tea." The Historical Supplement of Kang Li Guo also records a line saying, "Chang Lugong was an envoy to the Western Regions and brewed tea in his tent. The Zanpu—Tibetan King—asked, 'What is this?' Lugong said, 'It quenches thirst and eliminates烦恼, it is called tea.' The Zanpu said, 'I also have this!' Then he ordered it to be brought out, pointing and saying, 'This is from Shouzhou, this is from Shuzhou, this is from Guzhu...'” These two pieces of evidence can be seen as irrefutable proof that the custom of drinking tea had spread to the Western Regions and Tibet. As for Goryeo and Annam at that time, they were completely Chinese counties, so it is logical that this custom should have naturally spread there as well. However, the History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Champa—present-day southern Annam—clearly says, "The land does not produce tea." Perhaps, from the opposite perspective, we can also consider it evidence that they already "had tea," right? The so-called "does not produce" probably means it was imported from elsewhere; otherwise, why record it? As for the Jilin Leishi, which records the Korean dialect, "Tea is called tea," that is irrefutable proof that they already had tea.</p>
<p>The Tang and Song Dynasties of our country were also periods of frequent contact with Arabs and Persians from the Great 食 Empire. Our country established "Shipping Inspectorates" in Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Hangzhou, and other places to manage trade with them. The number of them traveling across the ocean to gather in our country was quite considerable. For example, during the An-Shi Rebellion, Tian Shengong massacred Yangzhou, and several thousand foreign merchants died. At the end of the Tang Dynasty, tens of thousands of foreign merchants resided in Guangzhou, and their residences, like the current concessions, were specially called "Fanfang." Thinking about it, they could not possibly ignore such a daily activity as drinking tea without also becoming accustomed to it. But was Chinese tea already being exported to western Asia at this time? Unfortunately, it is difficult to prove this in our country's records. Some say that in the mid-9th century, a Muslim merchant named Sulaiman mentioned Chinese people drinking tea in his travelogue, but whether he actually brought tea to the Western Regions is still a question!</p>

<p>The World of Arts</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion of Arts in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Hong Kong became a crucial stronghold in this Pacific War. What the situation is in Hong Kong regarding the arts is, of course, also worth reporting to readers.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has a population of about one and a half million. Although most are poor, there are also many rich people. Especially after the Sino-Japanese War, most of those who fled from various parts of China to Hong Kong were wealthy people. With money, of course, one wants to seek entertainment. Therefore, before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Hong Kong, like Shanghai, had every entertainment business, such as cinemas and theaters, filled to capacity. The lively scene could be said to be unprecedented in Hong Kong's history.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is an international island city with residents from various countries. Therefore, the music and dramas that are often performed also have an international flavor. Thus, music unique to various countries or bizarre dramas are performed in Hong Kong. It is said that since the outbreak of the war, although Hong Kong has suffered repeated air raids, the residents have remained calm. Even after the air raids, optimistic people still went to the cinema to watch movies for entertainment!</p>
<p>In terms of movies, the films publicly screened in Hong Kong's major cinemas are all Western films, mostly produced by Hollywood. However, because Chinese people account for 98 percent of Hong Kong's one and a half million residents, domestically produced films have always occupied a considerable market in Hong Kong. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation between Hong Kong and Shanghai has been cut off. Since then, domestically produced films made in Shanghai will not be able to be transported to Hong Kong for public screening. This, of course, is also a great blow to domestically produced films!</p>
<h3>Viewing "Islands of Men and Women"</h3>
<p>— Bi Cheng</p>
<p>The play "Islands of Men and Women," as the name suggests, must represent the various aspects of Shanghai after the war. In this respect, this play not only generally exposes the isolated island but also does its best to provide an in-depth analysis. The difference between it and "Chronicles of a Sorrowful City" is that, although "Chronicles of a Sorrowful City" has a very obvious main thread and is rich in drama, its representation of the isolated island is only a superficial surface, far less profound and realistic than "Islands of Men and Women." This may be due to the different spaces in which the two authors were located. All literary works are inseparable from the author's life experience and experience. I think "Islands of Men and Women" feels more intimate and interesting, probably because the playwright and I have both been trapped on the isolated island for many years?</p>
<p>The theme of "Islands of Men and Women" is to give a new path to all men and women who are fascinated by the real environment of the isolated island. The play describes merchants who engage in many improper businesses, depressed professors, depraved students, etc., all showing that it is not their own wishes, but the temptation of certain evil forces and environmental pressure. Therefore, according to the author's revelation, there is nothing to be done in this environment. All manpower and financial resources can only be transferred internally to be the right path.</p>
<p>The director's technique is extraordinary. The stage installations of the first, third, and second acts use a double-layered style, which is not only beautiful but also breaks many clichés of stage installations in fashion dramas. The manager's office in the second act's Grand Hotel is not grand enough, especially the common people on both sides are inclined inward in a figure-eight shape, which is not very reasonable. Except for the character of Zhang Li, who is not handled clearly enough, the personalities of all the other characters are very typical, so that each person uses many small actions to add a lot of color to the whole play. The actors are very even, and the whole team can work hard seriously. Shangguan Yunzhu's performance as Liu Xiangjun gives people a deep impression.</p>
<h3>Opening Drama Canceled</h3>
<p>— Art News Agency</p>
<p>The Golden Grand Theater has changed to performing day shows from the 17th (the other day), canceling the opening drama, and famous actors immediately take the stage. It is heard that the Tianchan Stage will also follow suit, but it will still perform evening shows, which will be shorter than the Golden Grand Theater's shows, each show being about two hours shorter. Although the Golden Grand Theater has extended its performance time to six hours per show, it still cannot finish on time due to the excessive length of the戏码. For example, the show finished twenty minutes late the other day, and today's show will also finish late.</p>
<h3>Guidance for the Lost</h3>
<p>Mei Xi and Yuan Meiyun (Yi)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>Xia Zhichao, a famous amateur actor, will join the stage at the Grand Theater's day show tomorrow, performing the play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" with the Kun Dan Wang Jiqiu.</p>
<p>Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan of the Golden Grand Theater will perform until the 21st. Starting next week, students from the Shanghai Drama School will continue to perform.</p>
<p>The Gong Stage will change the concert time on Saturdays, with the day show being from 12:00 to 4:30 and the night show being from 6:00 to 10:00. On Sundays, it will perform "Jin Qianbao Steals the Soul Bell Continuously."</p>
<p>Liang Beichao returned to Ping by car the other night. His father wrote to say that he had been engaged on the 26th day of the tenth lunar month.</p>
<h3>Crimson Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Lighting Candles to Welcome the Battlefield</p>
<p>The four of them drank and talked until dusk. Xu Jing and Liu Ying had to return to the women's barracks early, so they bid farewell and returned on horseback as before. As the two traveled along the road, they saw that it was more remote, with no streetlights, and very dark. But there was a faint crescent moon in the sky, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing in the clouds, and a few sparse small stars. The wind was blowing hard, making the night scene even more dim. They heard the sound of knocking on doors and shouting in the alley. When the two looked with night vision, they saw three or four Qing soldiers opening a house and entering. Liu Ying said to Xu Jing on the saddle, "The Prince Regent claims that the army is disciplined and does not disturb civilians. Brother Jing, when we came out just now, we saw many Qing soldiers, some marching in formation, some galloping with reins, looking high-spirited, arrogant, and self-righteous, thinking they were strong men from Guandong, with a spirit that could cover the world. Seeing them in my eyes really made me feel a little stuffy. Now, look, aren't they also doing those dog-stealing behaviors behind the backs of their generals, no different from bandits? Since I have bumped into them, I am not willing to forgive them. How about we follow them in to see what's going on?" Xu Jing had drunk a little too much wine tonight and was not afraid of making trouble, so he nodded and said yes. The two immediately jumped off their horses, each pressing their real swords at their waists, and tiptoed in pursuit. Inside was a very spacious courtyard, with some shadows of osmanthus trees. There was a row of three-bay half-houses facing outwards, and in the leftmost room, faint lamplight was faintly revealing on the window paper. At that time, those Qing soldiers had already rushed into that room like wolves and tigers, and there were only sounds of female wailing inside. The two hurriedly followed to the door, stood in the darkness, and looked into the room. They saw a young woman in her teens kneeling on the ground, begging the Qing soldiers. Although her hair was disheveled and she was wearing rough clothes, without makeup, she still had some beauty. (243)</p>
