<h3>平價米者仍擁擠應改善出售辦法工人相率回鄉用量漸減米糧評價或將重行議訂</h3>
<p>本市整個食米問題自經兩租界當局積極設法穩定以還、據悉食米供應、已可無虞匱乏、各米號即將普遍發售國洋米糧、目前購糴羣衆之擁擠情形、或可逐漸减退、咋據食糧管理委員會某君稱、該會對評市米糧售價、將予另行評訂、</p>

<h3>聖誕掇拾</h3>
<p>— 鴨溪</p>
<p>照例地，西國人的冬至節邪誕來而又去了，眞的，上海是屬於耶誕的，耶誕活躍在上海！瞧吧！</p>
<p>馬路上交織着人流的纖網，猩猩般的女人，花花公子，西裝，革履，鬈髮，胭脂，香水，……油光雪亮的汽車，來去以陣風！（可惜稀少得很）！銀樓的玻璃窗裏，陳列着華貴飾品，多惹眼！綢緞局懸掛着的綾羅綢緞，閃耀生光，多漂亮！點心店裏藕粉桂花糕，松　鵝油捲，五元一件，十元一件，多美味！公司的櫥窗裹，聖誕老人發禮品，不過，禮品落在櫥窗裏！啊！那　樣不是窮奢極慾！那一樣不是極盡誘惑的能事！然而，這都是為了慶祝聖誕！</p>
<p>舞廳裏－「一年一度，聖誕狂歡，盛况空前」；「新景象，聖誕佳節，更鬧猛」；「貴族中菜，每席五百元，豐腴大菜，每客五十元」；「還有名貴玩具，分贈來賓」；「名花美人伴舞；陣容堅强，音樂有勁」！</p>
<p>戲院里－「太虛道人」「遊戲紅塵」；「大鬧百貨店」「奈何天」；暖氣中，女人的身上飄出香的氣味來，裝着窈窕的姿式，偎在啣了雪茄烟的紳士懷中！</p>
<p>大世界門前，女人特別多，婀娜的身段，戴遍了花，首飾和綢緞；嘴紅紅的，眠睛閃着希望的光輝，向你徐送秋波，你知道，這是肉市塲的貨物</p>
<p>你走路若不是冒失鬼，朋友，如果用白相的神氣蕩馬路，聽：（隨時可以聽到的）！</p>
<p>－喂！老李，昨天我那個三翻，眞運氣！摸一隻寳，再打槓上摸一張，嚇！自摸淸一色平和呀！哈……</p>
<p>－嗨氣呀！他媽的八圈輸五底，眞可有點邪氣！</p>
<p>或者：</p>
<p>－前天到麗都去擺擺測字攤，那個新來的…不是？－是準美人的王莉莉</p>
<p>－不錯！……</p>
<p>酒樓，不是吹牛皮，熱鬧可並不遜於前，大的，小的，鴻運樓，大發樓，夜市一開，燈紅酒綠，眞是「座上客常滿，罇中酒不空」！「於戲，猗歟乎盛哉」！</p>
<p>你知道這些都是聰明的人物，「人生如朝露」，「今朝有酒今朝醉」呀！在這亂世，不尋求快活，還找苦吃不成？</p>
<p>還有－舟山活火鷄、臘腸臘肉湯，慶祝聖誕，不可不備</p>
<p>來個「新聞剪貼，」點綴這中西佳節……</p>
<p>「徐達泉砍斃胞兄，判處徒刑十年。…</p>
<p>「平安旅社，火災慘案眞相，被難同人，嗷首待援…」</p>
<p>「公館馬路發現兩炸彈。」</p>
<p>維持民食重要步驟，抑平麵粉價成功…」漸次地在蒼茫的天色下變得模糊，可是夜底感覺却並不因此而存在。馬路上泛濫着人底潮流，閃光的鋼軌是照樣地忙亂，擁擠喧嚷！</p>
<p>但，現在巳時過境遷，雖是聖誕之枚，除了一兩個地方，仍是車水馬龍，繁華如昔之外，其餘的地方，大都已墮入蕭索的境況！</p>
<p>高大的洋房，靜悄悄地排列在兩旁，黯淡的路燈，把兩旁禿頂的樹木，一條一條倒映在地。天公忽然無情地洒下濛濛的雨絲，故意作弄似地，聖誕老人哭喪着不知隱匿何處去了？</p>

<h3>經濟談</h3>
<p>— 馮</p>
<p>經濟業談，前戶聲明不再在本刊發表，但咋為耶誕，商業新　缺乏，不得已將此短文以補白。</p>
<p>沙船</p>
<p>在輪船未盛行前，沿海交通，往北多賴沙船，據淸道光間齊彥槐海道南運議中有云：</p>
<p>「出吳淞口迤南，由浙及閩粵，皆為南洋。迤北由通海崇山東直隸，及關東皆為北洋。南洋多磯島，水深瀾巨，非鳥船不行。北洋多磧，水淺礁硬，非沙船不行。鳥船必吃水丈餘，沙船大者才吃水四五尺。……沙船聚於上海，約三千五六百艘，其船大者載官斛三千石，小者一千五六百石。船主皆崇。通。海。南滙。寳山。上海。土著之富民，每造一船，須銀七八千兩。其多者，至一主有船四五十艘，故名曰船商。自康熙二十四年開海禁，關東豆麥，每年至上海者千餘萬石，而布茶各南貨至山東直隸關東者，亦由沙船載而北行。」</p>
<p>至何以名為沙船，行船提要有云「江南海船，名曰沙船，以其船底平闊，沙面可行可泊，稍擱無礙，常由沙港以至淮安，販蟹為業，是以沙　淺深，最為嫻熟，沙港者，沙間之深溝也。浙江海船名蛋船，又名三不像，亦能過沙，然不能貼近淺處，以船身重於沙船故也。惟閩廣海船底圓面高，下有大木三段，貼於船底，名曰龍骨，一遇淺沙，龍骨即陷泥沙中，風潮不順，便有疎虞，蓋其行走南洋，山礁業雜，船有龍骨，則轉灣趨避，較為靈便。（按即前文所謂鳥船是也）若赴天津，須先至江南盡山停船，等候西風，向東開行一日，避出淺沙北行，方保無虞，故赴天津奉天，歲止一次。」（未完）</p>
<h3>存糖有新擬議</h3>
<p>昨糖市因租界登記事未竣、尙不能自由通運、故依然無市、惟有新擬議、或將成立一新合作社　試二成之說、能否實現、尙未可必云、</p>
<h3>橘餅斷檔</h3>
<p>一橘餅近以輪　吿阻、絕無到貨、查前批所到數十件、業已告罄、即陳貨貢餅亦已售完、本廠一小數出品、售價甚昂、未能合銷香烟無甚榮辱</p>
<h3>香烟無甚榮辱</h3>
<p>香烟行情步趨高翔、昨為例假、同業賣買、殊少做開、故價無甚榮辱、計大英牌三千八百元、老刀牌三千六百兀、品海牌三千元、小仙女牌二千七百四十元、五華牌二千六百三十元、五十支大英牌每萬七百元、五十支大前門八百廿元、十支大前門八百廿元、日用品如火柴皂燭買價因當局限制嚴厲、無重大上落、鳳凰牌火柴一千四百五十元、黃祥茂皂五十一元五角、帆船牌洋燭三十九元、</p>
<h3>水電又加價矣！</h3>
<p>— 寥然</p>
<p>近日來哀哀小民，為了生活，眞是急得走頭無路：十萬三千根毛孔根根緊張；，四十二對大神經對對在閙着總動員，為了米，得四處張維，張羅之不足，又要「排班，為了煤球，得千方請託，請託之不已，仍然要「列隊」，魚貫蛇行而進；前天風聲一起，麵包大餅又頓起恐慌，又使巿民層急得成為油鑊邊的蟻！</p>
<p>幸虧兩租界當局，為維持民生，窮思竭慮，盡其最大可能，不斷採取抑减物價之步驟，俾能　止危機。數百萬市民如不知感激，那就是十足的糊塗。</p>
<p>連日在萬分之緊張中抑平了麪粉價，糴米擁擠情形雖未見鬆弛，總理會當　有好辦法。　芸芸衆生，熙熙攘攘，所為何來，為了生活，不得已也。</p>
<p>然而法商電車電燈公司又於昨天發表了水電增價。（電力公司叉有啓事）這是個意外的　雷，農得用戶們目瞪口呆，央掉知覺！此番「改變」個格，祇是聲明「將」自某月某日起實行」，作風叉與上次所謂「調整」者更為乾脆；雖　、　調整」，較上上次及卜日上次等等的直率的「加價婉曲有致得多，但綜上所述，價格平陞，奇民峯突起，則初無二致。民非水火不能活，　棄亦然；但由此使人民急了米　和煤球，似亦不得不來急急水電。在不得不照加的前提之下，吾儕小民，在暖洋洋的聖誕前後，實在除了囊螢映雪，喝喝一天落水之外，竟無絲毫辦法。</p>
<p>早些安息，省得俾　作夜，這為了應付現實，當局已數度吿誡，使大家小戶一體遵守，節省　力，這確有苦裏存在，我們認為對極，　母庸議；不過在嚼大餅吃麪疙瘩時，把省下來自每斤一元五角减至九角五分的　粉　（這不是夢話麺粉的確已在前天减價了，特此鄭重聲明），要來貼補貼補一膏火之資」，在「飲水思源」之餘，眞有「　肉　　」之痛。而且在公司當局看來，數度出此奇舉，不免有傷天地之和。但我們亦並非眞個希望法公司當局剜肉補瘡」，大也難小也難，誠如尊言，公共事業雖非「刻薄成家式的營業謀利化可比，但完全四平八穩的挺蝕，似亦大可不必。然則，何以言之？「允執厥中」；又曰：「雖不中，不遠矣。」斯可矣。平心論之，近來水電加費，十月一日一次，十二月一日一次，明年元旦又須一次，中間距離二個月不足，竟一月而再遷，確使人「永矢勿忘」；如不加限制，恐有一月三遷者矣。而且賬單上所謂附加費己被公司當局在八月中痛快地取消，難道附加中再附加不巳有碍觀瞻嗎？還是附加費已鷄零狗碎，不足以「變本加厲」嗎？如調超出預算，此種「利得預算」，不免啓人疑惑而不解：然而會計制度似非兒戲，各部份的　目總是最淸楚不過的。</p>
<p>兵法雖有云：「出其不意，攻其　備」；但在工　局拯民水火的立塲上言之：「　如為山，未成一　，止。吾止也！」而金而後，這「緊急通過辦法」，頗有嚴加愼重考慮的必要！</p>
<h3>一九四一年聖誕夜在上海</h3>
<p>— 孟公</p>
<p>「工部局頃發布吿略謂：査酒館菜館旅館以及舞塲等公共塲所，嗣後此類塲所在特別令節之收塲時間，應以夜晚二時為限。」</p>
<p>「禁駛私人汽車，已於咋晨九時起實施，工部局對于行駛准許證之發給，限制頗為嚴格，聞汽車之申請繼續行駛者共約一千五百起，而得工部局批準准者僅約六百五十起。」</p>
<p>一九四一年的聖誕節在這樣的局面中悄悄地降臨了。雖然報紙上的舞塲廣吿還依然佔着滿滿的一面，　用「狂歡通　」「贈送精美玩具」等字樣，甚至是Kiss競賽的字樣來點綴這個「特別令節」，然而困於糧食燃料中的市民對於今年的這個「特別令節」顯然感不到多大興趣，它是來得那麼悄悄地，宛如一個窮親戚走到正在敗落中的富家之家去，不為人所注意。</p>
<p>晚上十點半鐘，天在下着雨，使聖誕夜的空氣格外　得悽淸，公共車輛都進了廠了，悠長的馬路成了無人之域，　不夜的都市—上海睡了。</p>
<p>我懷着劉姥姥的心理，到一家門票貴至十二元的頭級舞塲去，要看看這個所謂「嚴高樂府」在今天究竟是怎樣一種情况。</p>
<p>門裹和門外是兩個世界。當從沉寂如死的馬路上冒着寒風而來，簡直無法想像在這睡了的上海還有這麽一個近乎瘋狂的所在；當淑女用她的纖纖玉手挽在紳士的臂灣中拾級登樓的時候，你是難以想像當他們在雨絲中從黃包車中狼狽地</p>
<p>樓上舞廳中的熱鬧氣象並不亞于往年。聖　花在銀瓶揷中吐出嫣紅，紳士淑女們套上了紙冠，相親地笑了，忘了剛股。舞女們打扮得花枝招展地，希望在這難得的特別令節」多收入一點舞票，洋琴鬼施展他的全身本領，希冀博得貴賓們的一點歡心。烟霧酒氣，把舞池織成了一片薄紗，在各個角落裏，不時有一匹銀光一閃，原來是紳士淑女們在這稍縱即逝的歡樂的機會中，請攝影師用閃光燈泡來為他們的愛，他們的友情留下一點痕跡。</p>
<p>掛在天花板上的三串汽球，是舞客們希望和幸福的象徵誰也不知道這些汽球會在何時撤下，但誰都無時無刻不加以注意，汽球稍稍移動，舞池便壅塞不通了，站在中聞，等候「幸福」的降臨，然而換得的是幾次失望。</p>
<p>歡娛苦短，時間在偷偷地溜走，當從烟，酒，音樂，媚笑，大腿，紅脣所織成的瘋狂的歡樂中　然發覺時間的推移，於是紳士淑女們用遺憾的口吻交換意見了，</p>
<p>怎麼，走吧？已經十一點半了。」</p>
<p>那個不信地看了看他自己的手表，戀戀地：「還可以再坐一刻鐘。」</p>
<p>這時汽球下來了，紳士們露出了他原始的本相。汽球在自已的手中碰到了，又被人輕輕地一拍升了上去，終於在爭奪中破碎了，發出拍拍的響聲。於是戴着低冠的紳士和淑女幻滅了他們的希望和幸福。看完了兩次表演，烟霧，酒氣，音樂，媚笑，紅脣，大腿巳不似先前那樣的容易刺激了，於是「收　時間，應以夜晚二時為限」的工部局通吿又在紳士們的記憶中甦醒過來，而舞客們便在逐漸的减退了。</p>
<p>「就是在最歡樂的時候，也抹不了心底的暗影。」我想到忘記自己也不是容易的事情，我站了起來。</p>
<p>門外的雨還在淅瀝　下着。集結在在門口的黃包車至少有一百</p>
<p>上海還在睡着未醒，也許睡得更沉了。</p>

<h3>Major Sea and Air Battle Between Britain and Japan Somewhere in the Pacific, Japanese Forces Order Ceasefire, Hong Kong Falls Yesterday</h3>
<p>Singapore, 24th (Havas) - Military authorities here have just released a communiqué stating, "Multiple Japanese warships, in ××××××××, were fiercely attacked by our country's warships and aircraft, and a major sea and air battle is now taking place. Detailed circumstances are currently unknown," it said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters, Army Division, announced at 8:45 PM today that the British military authorities in Hong Kong opened the city and surrendered at 4:50 PM on the 25th. Japanese forces immediately ordered a ceasefire at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Hong Kong (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (Reuters) - The evening of the 24th was the most crucial Christmas Eve in Hong Kong's history. During this festive season, the defending soldiers fought particularly bravely, determined to sacrifice everything to hold firm. All residents of Hong Kong Island welcomed this festive season with joy and unwavering resolve amidst the booming artillery fire. Although Japanese forces had landed a few days ago, the island's defensive lines were still holding firm. Repeated Japanese attacks were repelled, resulting in heavy casualties for them. Cables of encouragement from the British King, Prime Minister, and various parts of the British Empire continuously arrived in Hong Kong to boost the morale of the military and civilians, thus the spirits of all sectors were extremely high. When Chinese citizens heard that the Chinese army was bravely fighting in the Shenzhen area, they were all very proud, for China had contributed its strength to assist in defending this outpost of the ABCD powers.</p>
<p>Hong Kong (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 24th (Reuters) - An official communiqué released at 3 PM today stated that there were contacts in various forward areas, with small-scale encounters at outposts. Our side was quite successful. A large fire broke out in Kowloon and is currently burning.</p>
<p>Hong Kong (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th - The British government issued a communiqué on Christmas morning stating, "Japanese forces are exerting strong pressure on Repulse Bay. British forces have successfully withdrawn to Stanley Peninsula, and the battle for control continues fiercely." Governor Young issued a Christmas message to the military and civilians, saying that those who fought bravely to protect Hong Kong and resist the Japanese attacks should continue to be courageous and promote the spirit of nobility. Furthermore, he said that the Chinese troops in this area had advanced close to the New Territories, reducing the pressure on Hong Kong, which was greatly encouraging.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reinforcements Arrive in the Philippines, Little Change in the Situation, Powerful American Tank Brigade Moves to the Front Lines, Air Raid Alarms in Manila Sounded Three Times a Day</h3>
<p>Manila (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (Reuters) - A U.S. military spokesperson stated this morning that Japanese forces are still sending reinforcements continuously. There is fighting along the entire front line, but there are no significant changes in the battle situation.</p>
<p>Manila (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (United Press) - A communiqué from the U.S. Far East Command stated that there is not much news from the front lines, indicating that the defending forces on all lines have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>Washington (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 24th (Reuters) - A powerful U.S. tank brigade...</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese forces are currently advancing towards Manila in five routes. The threat of the Philippine capital being surrounded has gradually increased. On the 21st of this month, Japanese forces landed at ××××××. On Monday, they landed at ××××. The next day, they landed in ××× Bay. Yesterday, they landed again on the eastern coast of Luzon. With each landing, Japanese aircraft intensified their air raids. Currently, Japanese forces have occupied ××× city.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - The War Department released a communiqué today stating that a large number of Japanese transport ships have been discovered near the southwest of Luzon, apparently seeking a landing site south of Manila in order to attack Luzon from both sides.</p>
<p>Manila, 24th (Havas) - Air raid alarms were sounded three times here today. The first was at noon, when several Japanese aircraft flew overhead and bombed port facilities, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. Residents throughout the city maintained order and strictly followed the orders of the air raid wardens. The second alarm was at 2 PM, when several Japanese aircraft bombed industrial areas outside the city. The third alarm was at 3 PM. Although Japanese aircraft flew overhead, they did not drop any bombs. The alarm was lifted at 3:40 PM.</p>
<p>Manila (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (Reuters) - Belligerent nations have unofficially regarded Manila as a undefended city, which can be seen from the following incident: Three groups of Japanese aircraft circled overhead for an hour today and did not drop any bombs, and anti-aircraft guns did not fire at the Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters, Army and Navy Divisions, jointly announced at 11:35 AM this morning that Japanese army troops, under the cover of naval artillery fire, began landing on the east coast of Luzon yesterday at dawn. The battle situation is now turning in favor of the Japanese forces. At the same time, Japanese forces who landed in Lingayen Gulf are advancing south on Luzon, it was stated. Furthermore, the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" criticized this morning the Manila radio station's claim that the U.S. defense authorities in the Philippines are currently considering declaring Manila an undefended city, expressing surprise. It is said that this is likely a propaganda tactic by the U.S. side. It is almost unimaginable that Manila could be regarded as an undefended city, for no one knows better than the U.S. authorities in the Philippines how well-defended Manila is. Moreover, it is well-known that Manila has long been regarded as an extremely important base for the United States when attacking Japan. If Manila is designated as an undefended city, then Singapore, Chongqing, and Hong Kong must also be regarded as undefended cities, it was said.</p>

<h3>Washington Conference Continues to Discuss Military Cooperation Issues, Roosevelt and Churchill to Deliver Important Speeches, General King Says U.S. Needs to Replenish Naval and Air Power Urgently</h3>
<p>Washington (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 25th (United Press) - Senator Barkley announced that Churchill will deliver a speech to a joint informal session of Congress on the 26th. Members of the Supreme Court, cabinet members, and other senior government officials will attend. Roosevelt is also likely to attend. Churchill's speech will be broadcast.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - According to various newspapers, the main topics of the military conference currently being held here between Britain and the United States are: 1. The possibility of German leader Hitler opening a new battleground or launching a new offensive. If so, the anti-Axis countries will need to allocate more important war materials to various battlefields. 2. Whether the main countries participating in the war, namely Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, will focus all their efforts on the Soviet and Middle Eastern fronts, and whether the war against Japan in the Pacific will be temporarily put on the back burner, all of which will be decided. Furthermore, according to reports here, there is no immediate threat to the Pacific fortresses along the American continent. As for establishing a unified command, as General Foch did in the last World War, it is difficult to achieve due to the excessive distances between the current battlefields, it is said. Washington (Rebroadcast from Chongqing), 24th - It is understood that the issue to which the Anglo-American war conference is paying the most attention is strict naval and army action, rather than supply and economic issues. At the close of the first meeting yesterday, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson told reporters that he believed the meeting was very successful. It is understood that the possibility of the Nazis suddenly seizing the French navy and its bases was considered during the discussion of naval issues. On this point, Britain and the United States have indicated to Vichy that if the French navy surrenders, Britain and the United States will regard it as a hostile act. Senator George said that he believes that the result of strategic cooperation between Britain and the United States may be that the leaders of the two countries will separately command their armies and implement an overall strategic plan. This plan includes large-scale American participation in the Atlantic battle. The routes from South America to South Africa and then to the Middle East and China and India will become the main supply lines for the Allied countries in the Far East, it was said.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - According to a dispatch from the "New York Sun's" Washington correspondent, one of the important issues discussed by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill during their talks was the possibility of organizing an American expeditionary force and sending it to various battlefields.</p>

<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief Ernest King recently told reporters, "The road to victory is not only very long, but also very difficult. We must do our best and take good care of ourselves. But we need more planes and warships. Once we have a large number of planes and warships, we can strike a painful blow. Given time, we will definitely win," he said.</p>
<h3>Pope Pius XII's Christmas Message Advocates Five Principles to Eliminate International Disputes</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vatican, 25th - Pope Pius XII delivered a Christmas address, in which he said, "If we look at this world, it is difficult to find comfort. Humanity will destroy itself through war. In this sacred moment, we hear a strange call from the spire of the Church, saying, 'The King of Peace is surrounded by a glorious atmosphere, and the people of the world want to see his true face,' but this call soon disappears. Now, millions of people and families around the world are in a miserable situation, but we can also see everywhere in the world people bravely defending their inherited rights and territories, sacrificing themselves, and fighting for justice and righteousness. When we think of the injured and the prisoners of war, the bitter fate, the physical and mental torture, the death and destruction, the large cities and industrial areas that have suffered air raids, and the countless people who have fallen into poverty and hunger, we cannot help but be saddened. But today, the way to find a solution is still far away, because the goals of both sides are so far apart that it is not easy to achieve mutual understanding." The Pope does not recognize the failure of Christianity as one of the causes of this war. He said, "Christianity has not failed, but people have violated the true Christian spirit and teachings. The prosperity of material things and the progress of technology are not in themselves a disease, because what is harming the world today is what benefited us yesterday. The solution to all of this is to return to the throne of God, believe in God, and find the rights and obligations that are endowed to every individual and every group, and rebuild a strong foundation. Regarding the relationship between countries, the misuse of freedom and power should be restricted. The future reconstruction work can lead to good or evil. Only people with vision, determination, and courage are needed to bear this heavy responsibility, but often some people dream of establishing a new world order and seeking new paths because of the victory in the war. The original intention is to bring prosperity, happiness, and progress in the future, but if their construction work violates reason, justice, and humanity, they will inevitably deviate from the original intention and cause tragic results. We have learned from history that peace agreements, their spirit and provisions, are often contrary to our conscience, so they have no ability to exist. The existence of long-lived peace agreements has never been seen in history, which is a clear proof. The pain caused by this war is truly unbearable for mankind. To avoid such a catastrophe, it cannot be done by the power of one country or one group. All countries must find a way to avoid it. Therefore, it is a worldwide event, so it cannot be achieved without seeking Christ's help. I am now calling on the people of the world to pay attention to this danger that threatens peace, and it is also my responsibility. If the countries of the world want to avoid the horror of war, they must act in accordance with God's natural law." The Pope then suggested five essential conditions for maintaining international order, namely: 1. Under a new order based on religious principles, no matter the size or strength of a country, it must not violate the freedom, security, and territorial sovereignty of others. 2. Under this new order, the rights and special interests of minority groups in terms of faith, language, economic activities, and natural prosperity must not be openly or secretly oppressed. Within this scope, the state may require its minority groups to fulfill their civic responsibilities. 3. Under this new order, raw materials and natural resources of others must not be acquired in a selfish way. Often many countries disregard this principle, so most of the disputes of the "giver" of raw materials arise from this. 4. We must not allow the horror of war, the economic, social, and moral degradation to strike mankind a third time. If we want to prevent mankind from suffering again, then limiting armaments is necessary. International treaties must be observed, and all treaties must be concluded in accordance with the principles of justice and equality. Although there are many difficulties, if the leaders of all countries can cooperate sincerely, they will definitely achieve their goals. 5. In the new order, there must be no embarrassment of religious affairs, because faith is the gateway to moral sanctity, so that all kinds of virtues can enter the treasure house of the soul. Faith can create a strong character, which is absolutely necessary for building a new world order. Regarding social issues, if employers and employees both believe in the one God, then the solution to the matter is as easy as flipping the palm of one's hand. Atheism, which opposes God, is a great enemy of the new order. All those who believe in Jesus Christ and his laws, their spirit of love and sacrifice, can make a great contribution to social transformation.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 25th - Premier Pétain, last night on French radio, made a Christmas broadcast to the French prisoners of war. He said that the French prisoners of war hoped to spend Christmas with their families this year, but it was not realized, because the war is still spreading in other countries, the world is becoming darker, and peace is still remote. Pétain further asked the French prisoners to strengthen their minds, train their thoughts, and assured them that the government would do its utmost to enable the French prisoners of war to return to their homes as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Germany Will Not Stop Military Action Against the Soviet Union Until Victory is Achieved</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 24th - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop told a Spanish news agency interviewer yesterday, "The war on the Eastern Front cannot be stopped until Europe is no longer threatened from the East, and any reason for fear there has been completely eliminated. It is expected that this Soviet problem can be resolved by next year. The German army, navy, and air force, under the personal command of the leader, are taking this as their main task. However, the war should not be limited to the Soviet Union. In other battlefields, Britain and the United States will also encounter fierce battles from the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact. In short, Germany and its allied countries will definitely win. This is as certain as the earth revolves around the sun," he said.</p>

<h3>Goebbels Delivers a Radio Address</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 25th - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio address to the German people and frontline soldiers last night, stating that Germany is able to celebrate this third Christmas during the war. Although we have to be slightly thrifty, at least we do not have to fear the threats of the enemy. This is all thanks to the brave men who protect the motherland. Those who are abroad, in this festive season, their love for the motherland and compatriots will naturally arise. These brave soldiers can keep the motherland from being engulfed in the flames of war, and they are truly proud. Goebbels then declared to Germans overseas, "Most of you live in a hostile world. We Germans are fighting to protect our right to exist, but unexpectedly, we are envied everywhere. Our overseas compatriots are often surrounded by groups of hatred. We, who are in the country, only occasionally learn one or two things from the newspapers. You, who are in the situation, have almost no day without tasting this unfair treatment. Only because the few are no match for the many, our innocent compatriots are threatened and insulted by others for no reason, and are the target of their malicious propaganda. The reason why they are willing to endure humiliation without saying anything is only because they love our motherland. Today, the motherland knows how much responsibility they have fulfilled for the motherland. They do not want us to fail. We vow to work hard for them. If the motherland itself is not prepared to sacrifice, then the sacrifices made by millions of people today will inevitably be equal to being wasted. We must work hard, we must prepare to sacrifice. Victory is not a gift given by others, it must be strived for by our efforts. Everyone should fulfill their responsibilities. We must work together to win victory. The more we think of the leader, the more we should work harder to complete Germany's strongest front line. We must make our nation a greater and more beautiful nation after this war, and complete our free country. This is what we should promise the leader tonight. The leader can rely on his people at the front, in the country, and abroad. He is the leader for the rest of us. We vow to follow him with one heart. Carry the German flag, move forward. When the day of victory comes, the German flag and the country will be safe and sound. I wish you all a Merry Christmas. The hymns we sang in the past were to pray for world peace. Today we should strive to achieve this peace. 'Seek peace from victory.' This is our slogan," he said.</p>

<h3>China Boy Scouts Hold Local Administrative Talks</h3>
<p>Since the China Boy Scouts have been under the central leadership, it has been fifteen years in a blink of an eye. In order to thoroughly improve and widely promote the organization, so that children and youth across the country can universally receive this excellent training, and to meet wartime needs, the China Boy Scouts Association has specifically scheduled a discussion on local Boy Scout administration at 2:00 PM on the 26th at the Ministry of Education.

<h3>Crowds Still Swarm to Buy Low-Priced Rice; Selling Methods Should Be Improved; Workers Return to Their Hometowns in Droves; Rice Prices May Be Re-Negotiated</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken active measures to stabilize the city's overall rice supply, it is reported that there is no need to worry about rice shortages. Rice shops will soon universally sell domestic and foreign rice. The current crowded situation of people buying rice may gradually decrease. Yesterday, a certain gentleman from the Food Management Committee stated that the committee will re-evaluate and set the selling price of rice.</p>
<p>Workers and Their Families Return to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>The warehouses in the city, both Chinese and foreign, are still very full. According to a survey, the total rice storage in the city (including Hongkou, Pudong, West Shanghai, and the Central District) is over 650,000 bags. However, recently, many factories have suspended work, and most of the workers and their families have returned to their hometowns. The number of dockworkers who have dispersed is even greater. Therefore, the city's population is clearly decreasing. Statistics show that the majority of citizens who have left Shanghai this month are estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. The exact number cannot be determined. It is estimated that a monthly consumption of 210,000 bags of rice will be sufficient to meet the demand. Moreover, the bad practice of hoarding is gradually disappearing. Progress has also been made in dredging Vietnamese rice. Two million dan of Anhui rice are ready for transport. The food problem for Shanghai citizens can be expected to improve.</p>
<p>Crowds Still Buy Rice; Planning to Improve</p>
<p>Although the committee is now making every effort to maintain the balance of rice supply and demand, it hopes that residents will understand and cooperate, and not be alarmist and hoard food, so as not to weaken the rice warehouse storage. In the future, for the benefit of the public, it is possible to continue to strictly prohibit illegal hoarding, and if necessary, conduct large-scale investigations to suppress bad practices. According to rice shop owners, the best way to solve the crowding problem in retail sales is for the rice office to improve its collection methods to be quick and efficient. More collectors should be assigned, and the retail quantity limited to three *sheng* per person should be moderately increased. Rice shops should be evenly distributed and universally sell rice to avoid rice buyers running around and crowding each other.</p>
<p>The Trade Union Urges People to Collect Rice Coupons</p>
<p>According to the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association, the rice coupon issue for various rice shops in the public concession has been completely processed. However, there are still seven rice shops in the French Concession that have not collected these rice coupons. The association is eager to disclose the handling of rice coupon matters and hopes that these seven rice shops will quickly collect them to complete the procedures.</p>
<p>Abnormal Weather; Winter Feels Like Spring</p>
<p>The local weather is still controlled by the anticyclone, and the climate is very hot and humid. Although it is mid-winter, it feels like spring, and the humidity is very high, which poses a serious threat to public health. Therefore, many hospitals have cases of diphtheria, typhoid, and relapsing fever. Agricultural production has also been affected, and spring plowing is a major concern. The price of vegetables has also been surprisingly low in recent days.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Administrative Council Approves Next Year's Budget, Which Greatly Exceeds This Year's; Mayor Maurice Speaks</h3>
<p>Havas's Shanghai dispatch: The French Concession Administrative Council held its last meeting of the year on the 23rd of this month and approved the budget for next year. The total amount is 51,943,879.43 yuan, which is a significant increase compared to this year's 33,183,358.55 yuan. The reasons for this increase are attributed to the following three factors: 1. Increased prices of raw materials; 2. Doubled public relief expenses; 3. Salary adjustments for French Concession staff in various agencies. Before the adjournment, Councilor Maurice spoke, stating: "First, the members of the council, taking advantage of the last meeting of the year, would like to express their respect to the chairman of the council, Consul General of France in Shanghai, Mr. Magre, for his leadership since taking office, especially during these turbulent times. In addition, the council also requests the Consul General to convey their regards to Colonel Fabre, Chief of Police of the Concession, Mr. Tan Gu, Director General of the Municipal Council, and all staff members." Consul General Magre then delivered a response, saying: "All the staff of the French Concession Police and the Municipal Council have been able to remain loyal to their duties, regardless of any sacrifice. For example, the deaths of Judge Dugue and Sergeant Rutinon are proof of that. The council is composed of representatives of Chinese and French residents and expatriates from various countries, who have been able to cooperate effectively in their joint work. The council members have given me great help in spirit and in material terms, for which I am deeply grateful. I hope that in the coming year, I will continue to rely on your strong support to alleviate the suffering of residents due to unemployment and food supply difficulties. I believe that we can overcome our current difficulties by cooperating with the Japanese authorities."</p>
<p>Thirteen Ounces of Gruel per Bowl Distributed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Benevolent Association, Yusheng Association, Lianyi Benevolent Association, Huangwan Association, and more than a dozen other benevolent organizations jointly organized a gruel distribution association. Yesterday, a meeting was held to revise the distribution quantity of gruel. The following is an excerpt from its official letter to various organizations: “Dear Sirs, a meeting of various gruel distribution organizations was convened at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Regarding the issue of the amount of gruel distributed, it was decided that the original gruel tickets (six *fen*) will still be used, with three tickets exchanged for one bowl of gruel, weighing thirteen ounces according to city scales. Each organization will be responsible for the investigation, and in addition to notifying the various gruel shops to strictly comply, the gruel shops will adjust the price every three days and verify the records."</p>
<h3>Public Buses Now Run All Day, Cancelling the Morning, Noon, and Evening Shift System; However, the Number of Vehicles is Reduced and They Return Earlier</h3>
<p>Public buses in the Public Concession, previously limited by the insufficient storage of gasoline, had to be changed to a morning, noon, and evening shift system to facilitate traffic. However, due to the shortened operating hours on each route, the number of passengers along the way has increased sharply, causing crowding and disorder, and concerns about accidental dangers to passengers. Therefore, the company has tried to increase the number of services and has achieved satisfactory results. Yesterday, all bus routes 1, 2, 9, 10, and 14 have officially resumed operation from morning to night. However, the number of vehicles on each route has been reduced, and all buses are scheduled to return to the depot at 6:00 PM every evening. However, bus route 7, which runs to Xujiahui, will remain suspended.</p>
<h3>Tenants Rejoice as Landlords Are Temporarily Prohibited from Forced Eviction</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has announced that landlords will not be allowed to forcibly evict tenants who are temporarily unable to pay rent before March 31 of next year. Tenants generally rejoiced upon hearing the news. According to some tenants, if a tenant has the ability to pay rent, they will certainly not use this order from the Municipal Council to refuse to pay rent or demand rent reduction. Moreover, such a move is unlikely, as all rent disputes that cannot be resolved amicably should be submitted to the Conciliation Committee of the Municipal Council for review. The Municipal Council's order benefits citizens in that there are indeed many tenants who are temporarily unable to pay rent, or can only pay a portion of the rent, due to the current economic situation. They were extremely worried about being forcibly evicted. Upon hearing the announcement of this order by the Municipal Council, they all felt relieved.</p>
<h3>Crime Log</h3>

<h3>Christmas Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Ya Xi</p>
<p>As usual, the Westerners' winter solstice festival, Christmas, has come and gone. Indeed, Shanghai belongs to Christmas. Christmas is active in Shanghai! Look!</p>
<p>The streets are interwoven with the fine web of human traffic: ape-like women, playboys, suits, leather shoes, curled hair, rouge, perfume... shiny cars coming and going like gusts of wind! (Too few, unfortunately!) The silver shops' glass windows display luxurious ornaments, so eye-catching! The silk and satin bureaus hang dazzling brocades and satins, so beautiful! In the confectionery shops, lotus root powder osmanthus cakes, and crispy goose oil rolls, cost five yuan each, ten yuan each, so delicious! In the company's display windows, Santa Claus distributes gifts, but the gifts remain in the display windows! Ah! What isn't luxurious and extravagant! What doesn't do its utmost to entice! Yet, all this is to celebrate Christmas!</p>
<p>In the dance halls: "Annual Christmas Carnival, Unprecedented Grandeur!"; "New Look, Christmas Festival, Even More Lively!"; "Nobleman's Chinese Cuisine, 500 Yuan Per Table, Sumptuous Dishes, 50 Yuan Per Guest!"; "Also Precious Toys Distributed to Guests!"; "Famous Beauties Dance Together; Strong Lineup, Powerful Music!"</p>
<p>In the theaters: "Taixu Taoist," "Playing in the Mortal World"; "Riot in the Department Store," "Helpless Destiny"; in the warm air, the scent of women wafts out, posing gracefully, nestled in the arms of gentlemen with cigars!</p>
<p>In front of the Great World, there are particularly many women, with graceful figures, adorned with flowers, jewelry, and silks; their mouths red, their eyes flashing with hopeful light, slowly sending you autumn waves. You know, these are the goods of the meat market.</p>
<p>If you are not a careless walker, my friend, if you stroll down the road with an attitude of leisure, listen (you can hear it at any time)!</p>
<p>- Hey! Old Li, yesterday my three reverses, what luck! I drew a treasure, then drew another one on the *gang*, wow! Self-drawn Clear One Suit and Peacefully Won! Ha...</p>
<p>- Damn it! Eight rounds and lost five bottoms, really weird!</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>- The day before yesterday I went to Lidu to set up a fortune-telling stall, that newcomer... isn't she? - That's right, the beauty Wang Lili.</p>
<p>- Correct!…</p>
<p>The restaurants, I'm not bragging, are no less lively than before. Big and small, Hongyun Restaurant, Dafa Restaurant, once the night market opens, the lights are red and the wine is green. It really is "Guests fill the seats, the wine jars never empty!" "Oh, how glorious and magnificent!"</p>
<p>You know that these are all clever people, "Life is like morning dew," "Drink today's wine today!" In this chaotic world, why not seek pleasure?</p>
<p>Also - Zhoushan live turkey, sausage and bacon soup, essential for celebrating Christmas.</p>
<p>Let's have a "news clipping" to embellish this Sino-Western festival...</p>
<p>"Xu Daquan hacked his brother to death, sentenced to ten years imprisonment…"</p>
<p>"The truth about the tragic fire at the Pingan Hotel, the victims cry out for help…"</p>
<p>"Two bombs found on Gongguan Road."</p>
<p>"Important steps to maintain people's food supply, successful suppression of flour prices…" gradually became blurred in the vast sky, but the feeling of the night remained. The streets flooded with the tide of people, and the flashing steel rails were just as busy, crowded, and noisy!</p>
<p>But now, time has passed, and although it is Christmas, apart from one or two places that are still bustling and prosperous as before, most other places have fallen into a desolate state!</p>
<p>The tall foreign buildings stand quietly on both sides, and the dim streetlights cast long shadows of the bare trees on the ground. The heavens suddenly shed a drizzle of rain mercilessly, as if to deliberately tease, Santa Claus has disappeared into who knows where, crying.</p>
<h3>Current Bank Withdrawal Procedures Remain Unchanged Before the New Year Holiday; No Definite Procedures for Withdrawal and Salary Payment</h3>
<p>Banking circles in the city, both Chinese and foreign, have indicated that various banks' payment procedures will not be further modified until after the holiday. Banks will be closed on the 25th and 26th, and the first three days of next year.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Foreigners' Withdrawals Remain</p>
<p>Recently, major British, American, and Dutch banks have been following the same rules and procedures for withdrawing cash from personal accounts, with no special changes in terms of procedures. Foreign banks continue to implement remittance procedures as usual. Currently, British, American, and Dutch expatriates are allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan from banks each month. People from non-enemy countries against Japan are allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan per week, totaling 4,000 yuan per month. Chinese banks allow individuals to withdraw 500 yuan every three days from their accounts. However, the payment methods still vary slightly.</p>
<p>Withdrawal and Salary Payment Procedures Unclear</p>
<p>Various businesses continue to apply to HSBC, Citibank, and Chase Bank for withdrawals to pay salaries, but the details are still unknown. According to people in the banking industry, it is still too early, and the procedures for how businesses will be able to withdraw funds to pay salaries have not yet been clearly explained.</p>
<h3>New French Water and Electricity Prices</h3>
<p>The French Concession's French water and electricity company yesterday notified users in the Concession, stating that from January 1, 1942, charges will be collected according to the newly established prices. The newly established prices are excerpted below: - Electricity for lighting: 6.2 *jiao* per KWH; - Electricity for power: 0.4 *yuan* and 0.39 *yuan* per KWH, depending on whether the total installed capacity is below or above 14 horsepower; - Electricity for heating: 0.38 *yuan* per KWH; - Tap water: 0.38 *yuan* per cubic meter.</p>
<p>Power Company Imposes Temporary Surcharges</p>
<p>For ordinary users whose electricity usage period is revised within January 1942, the Shanghai Power Company should add a fuel adjustment fee and various basic charges (including electricity price, appliance rental fee, and various service fees) to the bills for the temporary surcharges collected. The temporary surcharges for the fuel adjustment fee have been approved by the Municipal Council and are calculated as follows: - Fuel adjustment fee: 1.626 *qian* per degree; - Temporary surcharge: 200%.</p>
<h3>No Permit Required for Transporting Coal Under 1 Ton</h3>
<p>It is reported that coal merchants transporting any smoke-free white coal under one ton do not need to obtain a transportation permit from the Coal Management Committee. For quantities of two tons or more, standard procedures must be followed. A permit fee of 4 yuan in national currency is charged per ton. It is heard that coal merchants within the French Concession can apply for permits from the French Police Department. However, the transportation permit is only allowed for transporting coal within the two concessions and is strictly prohibited from being transported to other places. Otherwise, if discovered, it will be confiscated and forfeited.</p>
<h3>Guangxia Cup Successfully Concludes; Yiguang Triumphantly Wins the Grade A Championship; Shisheng Suffers a Narrow 5-4 Defeat in the Final; Ruilong and Mengshi Draw in the Exhibition Match</h3>
<p>The second Guangxia Cup Small Ball League successfully concluded yesterday, and the champions and runners-up of each group have also been determined. In Group C, Youyong defeated Guangxia 2-1 to win the championship. In the exhibition match, Ruilong and Mengshi B each scored one goal and drew. In the final match of Grade A, Yiguang narrowly defeated Shisheng 5-4 in extra time to win the Grade A overall championship and the large silver cup donated by Chen Shichang. During the Youyong vs. Guangxia match, Guangxia player Sun Defu's behavior was improper and repeatedly violated the rules of the game. The referee, Jiang Yinsheng, announced the cancellation of the player's right to participate in any cup competitions held at the Guangxia field forever as a warning.</p>
<p>In the Grade C match, Youyong took the initiative and scored the first goal. The first half ended. Guangxia's counter-attack was ineffective, giving Youyong another opportunity to attack and score another goal. Two minutes before the end of the match, Guangxia finally pulled one goal back. As a result, Youyong won the championship 2-1.</p>
<p>Exhibition Match</p>
<p>Mengshi used a mixed team of Grade A and B players. Tang Genfu received the ball on the line and shot powerfully, scoring the first goal and ending the first half. Ruilong did not want to be outdone. Chen Linxiang received support from Xu Xisheng and shot into the goal from ten yards. Time ran out, and both sides tied 1-1 and shook hands in peace.</p>
<p>Grade A Championship</p>
<p>Yiguang's Zhao Yongfang went deep into enemy territory alone and scored a goal. Shisheng counterattacked, and Liao Shiyi built a goal on the border line and tied the score. Before long, Shisheng's Ye Yiting scored a goal from a distance, taking the lead by one goal. In less than five seconds, Tao Tingfu attacked, and Ye Qingfu put the ball in the net. The first half ended with a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Re-Fight</p>
<p>Shisheng's Zhu Weizhong scored another goal. Yiguang's Zhao Yongfang resumed his role and scored a goal, making it 3-3. Before long, Yiguang's Li Guanghua fouled and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty, which Liao Shiyi took. Shisheng took the lead again. The good times did not last long. Defender Tang Yongfang committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty in the same way. Zhao Hefang took the penalty and scored. Time ran out, and the score was tied 4-4. No one could tell who was the champion, so they played for an additional ten minutes. Yiguang had a good opportunity for a corner kick, which Lin Zhaojun scored. Yiguang finally defeated Shisheng 5-4 and won the Grade A overall championship. The recorded match results are listed below:</p>
<p>Youyong Wins Guangxia (Grade C Final) 2-1</p>
<p>Ruilong and Mengshi Tie (Exhibition) 1-1</p>
<p>Yiguang Wins Shisheng (Grade A Final) 5-4</p>

<h3>Economic Talk</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The economic talker previously stated that he would no longer publish in this magazine, but yesterday was Christmas, and new commercial topics were lacking, so this short article was used as a filler.</p>
<p>Sandboats</p>
<p>Before the prevalence of steamships, coastal transportation, especially to the north, relied heavily on sandboats. According to Qi Yanhai's "Proposal on Maritime Transport to the South" during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty:</p>
<p>"Going south from the mouth of Wusong, through Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, is called the South Ocean. Going north through Tonghai, Chongming, Shandong Zhili, and Guandong is called the North Ocean. The South Ocean has many islands and reefs, with deep and turbulent waters, making it impossible for bird boats to navigate. The North Ocean has many shoals, with shallow and hard reefs, making it impossible for anything but sandboats to navigate. Bird boats must have a draft of more than ten feet, while large sandboats only have a draft of four or five feet... Sandboats gather in Shanghai, about three to five hundred ships. The large ships can carry three thousand *dan* of official grain, and the small ones can carry one thousand five to six hundred *dan*. The shipowners are all wealthy people from Chongming, Tongzhou, Hainan, Baoshan, and Shanghai. Each ship costs seven to eight thousand taels of silver to build. Some own as many as forty or fifty ships, so they are called ship merchants. Since the lifting of the maritime ban in the twenty-fourth year of Kangxi, over ten million *shi* of soybeans and wheat from Guandong arrive in Shanghai every year, and cloth, tea, and various southern goods are also carried north to Shandong, Zhili, and Guandong by sandboats."</p>
<p>As for why they are called sandboats, "Treatise on Sailing" says, "Jiangnan sea boats are called sandboats because their bottoms are flat and wide, and they can travel and anchor on sandy surfaces without being hindered by slight grounding. They often travel from sand ports to Huai'an, trading crabs. Therefore, they are most familiar with the depths of the sandbanks. Sand ports are deep channels between sands. Zhejiang sea boats are called egg boats, also known as 'three unlikes,' and can also pass through sand, but cannot get close to shallow places because their hulls are heavier than sandboats. Only the Min and Guangdong sea boats have round bottoms and high sides, with three large pieces of wood attached to the bottom, called keels. When encountering shallow sand, the keel sinks into the sand, and if the wind and tide are unfavorable, there may be problems. This is because they travel in the South Ocean, where mountains and reefs are mixed, and ships with keels are more flexible in turning and avoiding obstacles (i.e., the bird boats mentioned earlier). If going to Tianjin, they must first go to Jinshan in Jiangnan to stop the ship, wait for the west wind, and sail east for a day to avoid the shallow sand before sailing north to ensure safety. Therefore, they only go to Tianjin and Fengtian once a year." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>New Proposals for Sugar Storage</h3>
<p>Because the sugar market's registration in the concession has not been completed, free circulation is still not possible, so there is still no market. However, there are new proposals, such as the establishment of a new cooperative to try the 20% tax theory. It is uncertain whether it can be realized.</p>
<h3>Tangerine Peel Candies Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Tangerine peel candies have recently been blocked by ships, and no goods have arrived. The previous batch of dozens of pieces has already been sold out. Even the old stock of tribute cakes has been sold out. A small number of products from this factory are sold at very high prices and have not been successfully integrated into cigarette sales.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes: Not Much Honor or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices are trending upwards. Yesterday was a regular holiday, and there were few transactions among peers, so there was no significant increase or decrease in price. Big Ben brand was 3,800 yuan, Old Knife brand was 3,600 yuan, Pinhai brand was 3,000 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 2,740 yuan, Fifty-Five brand was 2,630 yuan, fifty Big Ben brand was 700 yuan per 10,000, fifty Big Front Door brand was 820 yuan, and ten Big Front Door brand was 820 yuan. Daily necessities such as matches, soap, and candles did not fluctuate significantly due to strict government restrictions. Phoenix brand matches were 1,450 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap was 51.5 yuan, and Sailboat brand candles were 39 yuan.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Prices Increase Again!</h3>
<p>— Liao Ran</p>
<p>In recent days, the poor common people have been truly desperate for a way out in order to live: all 133,000 pores are strained; the forty-two pairs of major nerves are all clamoring for a general mobilization. For rice, they have to seek help everywhere, and even that is not enough, so they must "queue up." For coal briquettes, they have to plead in every way, and even after pleading, they still have to "line up" and proceed in a snake-like manner. The day before yesterday, when the rumor spread, bread and pancakes were once again the cause of panic, turning the citizens into ants on the edge of a hot wok!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to maintain the people's livelihood, have racked their brains and done their utmost to continuously take steps to suppress prices, so as to stop the crisis. If the millions of citizens do not appreciate this, they are utterly foolish.</p>
<p>After days of intense effort, the price of flour has been suppressed. Although the crowding to buy rice has not eased, the General Council must have good solutions. All living beings, bustling and hustling, what are they doing? For the sake of life, they have no choice.</p>
<p>However, the French Tramway and Electricity Company yesterday announced an increase in water and electricity prices. (The power company also has an announcement.) This was an unexpected thunderbolt, leaving users stunned and numb! This time, the "change" is only a statement that it "will" be implemented from a certain month and day, and the style is even more straightforward than the last so-called "adjustment." Although the euphemism of "adjustment" is much more tactful than the direct "price increase" of the last time and the time before that, the overall result is the same: prices rise sharply, and the people's discontent erupts. People cannot live without water and fire, and the same goes for electricity. But this forces people who are already scrambling for rice and coal briquettes to also scramble for water and electricity. Under the premise of having to accept the increase, we common people, around the warm Christmas season, really have no other choice but to collect fireflies for light and drink rainwater all day long.</p>
<p>Go to bed early, save electricity for the night. The authorities have repeatedly warned everyone to abide by this together, large and small households alike, to save power. This is indeed hardship, and we think it is absolutely right, there is no need to discuss it. However, while eating pancakes and noodles, using the money saved from the reduced price of flour (this is not a dream, the price of flour did indeed decrease the day before yesterday, we solemnly declare this), from one dollar and fifty cents per catty to ninety-five cents, to subsidize the cost of electricity, while "drinking water, remembering the source," there is a true "cutting flesh to heal a sore" pain. Moreover, in the eyes of the company authorities, taking such extraordinary measures repeatedly cannot help but harm the harmony of heaven and earth. But we do not really hope that the French company authorities will "cut flesh to heal sores." It is difficult to do both big and small things well. As you said, public utilities are not comparable to "running a business by being stingy," but it is also unnecessary to operate at a complete loss. So, what should be done? "Hold fast to the middle ground." It is also said, "Though you miss the mark, you are not far from it." This is acceptable. Frankly speaking, water and electricity fees have increased recently: once on October 1st, once on December 1st, and again on New Year's Day next year. The interval between them is less than two months, actually changing twice in one month, which truly makes people "never forget." If there are no restrictions, I fear there will be three changes in one month. Moreover, the so-called surcharge on the bill was happily canceled by the company authorities in mid-August. Isn't adding a surcharge on top of a surcharge unsightly? Or is it that the surcharge has become too insignificant to "intensify"? If the adjustment exceeds the budget, this kind of "profit budget" cannot help but arouse suspicion and confusion. However, the accounting system does not seem like child's play, and the items in each part are always very clear.</p>
<p>Although military strategy says, "Attack where they are unprepared, strike where they are unguarded," from the perspective of the Public Works Bureau rescuing the people from water and fire, "If you build a mountain and stop before completing one basket, stop. I stopped!" And then after that, this "emergency measure" needs to be considered very carefully!</p>
<h3>Christmas Eve 1941 in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Meng Gong</p>
<p>"The Public Works Bureau recently issued a notice stating that the closing time for public places such as bars, restaurants, hotels, and dance halls on special holidays should be limited to 2:00 AM."</p>
<p>"The ban on private cars has been in effect since 9:00 AM yesterday. The Public Works Bureau is very strict in issuing driving permits. It is reported that there were about 1,500 applications for continued driving, but only about 650 were approved by the Public Works Bureau."</p>
<p>Christmas 1941 quietly arrived in such a situation. Although the dance hall advertisements in the newspapers still occupy a full page, using words such as "carnival all night" and "giving away exquisite toys," and even the words "Kiss competition" to decorate this "special holiday," the citizens trapped in food and fuel shortages obviously do not feel much interest in this year's "special holiday." It comes so quietly, like a poor relative going to the home of a declining wealthy family, unnoticed.</p>
<p>At 10:30 PM, it was raining, making the air of Christmas Eve particularly desolate. Public transportation had all returned to the factory. The long streets became a no-man's-land. The sleepless city—Shanghai—was asleep.</p>
<p>With the mentality of Grandma Liu, I went to a top-class dance hall with a door ticket as expensive as twelve yuan, to see what this so-called "Yan Gao Yuefu" is like today.</p>
<p>The inside and outside of the door are two different worlds. Coming from the silent, dead streets in the cold wind, it is simply impossible to imagine that in this sleeping Shanghai there is such a near-crazy place. When a lady holds the arm of a gentleman with her slender hands and ascends the stairs, it is difficult to imagine when they are caught in the rain from the rickshaw.</p>
<p>The lively atmosphere in the upstairs dance hall is no less than in previous years. Christmas flowers are blooming in silver vases, gentlemen and ladies put on paper crowns and smile affectionately, forgetting the current situation. The dancers dress up flamboyantly, hoping to earn more dance tickets during this rare "special holiday." The foreign musicians display all their skills, hoping to win the favor of the VIPs. Smoke and alcohol weave the dance floor into a veil. In every corner, a flash of silver light occasionally appears. It turns out that gentlemen and ladies are using flashbulbs to leave a trace of their love and friendship in this fleeting opportunity of joy.</p>
<p>The three strings of balloons hanging from the ceiling are symbols of the dancers' hope and happiness. No one knows when these balloons will be taken down, but everyone pays attention to them at all times. The slightest movement of the balloons causes the dance floor to become congested. Standing in the middle, waiting for "happiness" to descend, but what is gained is several disappointments.</p>
<p>Joy is short-lived. Time is quietly slipping away. When one suddenly realizes the passage of time in the crazy joy woven by smoke, alcohol, music, flattering smiles, thighs, and red lips, gentlemen and ladies exchange opinions in a regretful tone,</p>
<p>"What, let's go? It's already eleven thirty."</p>
<p>The one who didn't believe it looked at his own watch and said reluctantly: "We can sit for another quarter of an hour."</p>
<p>At this time, the balloons came down, and the gentlemen revealed their original nature. The balloons touched each other in their hands, and then were gently patted and raised again, and finally shattered in the scramble, making a snapping sound. So the gentlemen and ladies wearing low crowns shattered their hopes and happiness. After watching two performances, the smoke, alcohol, music, flattering smiles, and red lips were no longer as stimulating as before. Then the Public Works Bureau's notice that "the closing time should be limited to 2:00 AM" revived in the memories of the gentlemen, and the dancers gradually diminished.</p>
<p>"Even in the most joyful times, the dark shadow in the heart cannot be erased." I thought that forgetting oneself is not an easy thing either, and I stood up.</p>
<p>The rain outside the door was still falling pattering. At least one hundred rickshaws gathered at the entrance.</p>
<p>Shanghai is still sleeping, perhaps sleeping even more deeply.</p>

<h3>Sun Min in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xiepu Ke</p>
<p>Sun Min, a fellow townsman of Naiyi, is one of the actors who has recently begun to stand out for his portrayal of young men in the film industry. He is a typical "pretty boy" with a sly smile. He is truly like an elegant and refined young master. His personality is particularly suited to playing "纨绔子弟" (playboys), and one often sees him flirting and teasing in Star Film productions!</p>
<p>He is from Shiganwan, Wuxi, Naiyi. Speaking of Sun Jun's childhood stories, they are quite amusing and show that Sun Jun had an interest in art from a young age.</p>
<p>He was playful and endearing as a child! He once studied at Donglin School in Wuxi. After graduating, his parents planned for him to learn commerce, but he always avoided it, failing at everything. His parents had no choice but to let him enter the "circle of life" on his own. Because of his lively and active personality, he aspired to roam freely. He was willing to abandon industry and commerce and devote himself to the film industry. He initially worked as a young actor at Dayi Company, founded by the Shao Zuiweng brothers, and then transferred to Star Company. His skills improved rapidly, quickly catching up with Jin Yan, Wang Yin, Gao Zhanfei, Gong Jianong, and others!</p>
<p>The writer has disturbed his "family lunch" at his residence several times. The cooking of his Changzhou wife was perfectly suited to the Naiyi palate and was very delicious. The fragrance still lingers to this day. I haven't seen him since the incident, and I can't help but feel a sense of longing!</p>
<h3>Trends in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>According to an authority in the film industry: It is expected that all film companies in this city will be forced to close in February next year. The shortage of film stock is one reason, but the main reason is that the sale of domestic films to the South Seas has always accounted for over 40% of total revenue. Now, transportation has been cut off and the area has been included in the war zone. Furthermore, since the implementation of earlier closing times for entertainment venues and public transportation in this city, business has decreased by half compared to before January 28th. Under the current circumstances, where human and material resources are twice as expensive as before, the companies will inevitably lose a lot of capital and have no choice but to close down.</p>
<p>Some days ago, Mr. Fen Yu reported that Queen of Bengbeng Opera, Bai Yushuang, would come to Shanghai to perform, but a friend from Tianjin brought reliable news that Bai Ling is suffering from a severe venereal disease and is receiving treatment in a hospital in that city. It is feared that she will not recover for some time.</p>
<p>The Tianfeng Drama Society suddenly dismissed more than ten members last week. The reason is unknown. The new play "Plum Blossom Dream" is a Qing dynasty costume drama, and the capital invested is no less than the sensational drama "Grievances of the Qing Palace."</p>
<p>Recently, amateur drama societies in this city have been exceptionally active. They are all rushing to rehearse new plays, which will be staged successively during the Lunar New Year. These include the Canghai Drama Society's "The Beauty Trap," the Shengchi Drama Society's "Ten Thousand Miles Return," the Xuanduo Drama Society's "Sleepless City," the Yemo Drama Society's "A Way Out," and the Yixing Drama Society's historical drama "Paint Your Body and Swallow Charcoal."</p>
<h3>Rushing to Film "Fallen Plum Blossoms": Wang Xichun Boards at Hualian Factory</h3>
<p>— Bei Shi</p>
<p>Dacheng Factory and Hualian Factory have been cooperating in terms of manpower and resources for a long time. Since "New Fisherman's Song" and "The Fragrance of Home Flowers" were completed and released, Dacheng Factory took a temporary rest, and now they are working actively again. In this period, they are filming two films: one is "Wedding Night in the Bridal Chamber," directed by Zhu Shilin and starring Chen Yanyan and He Bin; and the other is "Fallen Plum Blossoms," written by Tu Guangqi, co-directed by Zhu Shilin and Tu Guangqi, and starring Wang Xichun.</p>
<p>In order to speed up the work, they plan to rush to film "Fallen Plum Blossoms" in a short period of time, and to prevent changes in the middle, all the actors and workers in "Fallen Plum Blossoms" are boarding at Hualian Factory. Therefore, Wang Xichun also bid farewell to her room on the upper floor of the International Photo Studio and moved to the triangle area in Xujiahui yesterday.</p>
<p>Hualian Factory is located in the suburbs of Shanghai, where the scenery is excellent and the air is fresh. Therefore, Wang Xichun and others said that being able to take a break from the city and live in that natural sanatorium can help with their health!</p>
<p>The Music Education Association, in order to discover and promote musical talents widely, has specially established courses in composition, singing, violin, piano, etc., and is recruiting free students. The number of applicants has exceeded the limit in recent days. It is reported that the association, at the request of the majority of music students, has decided to hire more professors and expand the number of students. Anyone who is interested in learning music can register at the Yongyu Qin Hang, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mahe Road.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Precious Flowers</h3>
<p>— Kuang Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Welcoming the Candlelight on the Battlefield</p>
<p>When Chen Yuanyuan saw San Gui, she couldn't help but cry with joy, and said in a trembling voice: "General Wu, things are unpredictable, and disaster has befallen us. After we parted, who would have thought that I would encounter such a great catastrophe. I almost thought I would never see the General again in this life." As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes. San Gui reached out and held her soft hand, not knowing what to say to comfort her, but said: "When I received the bad news outside Shanhaiguan that you had been seized, I couldn't sleep or eat, and worried day and night. I wished I had wings to fly to your side and rescue you from danger, so I vowed to send troops to suppress the bandits and rescue my beloved. Fortunately, the Qing soldiers were able to abandon their grievances and help me drive away the rebels. But when I arrived in the capital, I couldn't find any news about you, and I was very anxious. I was afraid that the rebel leader had taken you away, so I quickly pursued them. Heaven is kind, you stayed in the capital and didn't leave. This is also our fate as husband and wife, that we can repair the broken mirror." Yuanyuan was very moved by San Gui's words, and just shed tears. San Gui then asked her to get out of the carriage and sit in the precious carriage he had prepared to welcome her. The carriage was filled with a strange fragrance, making it fragrant and sweet. He himself sat in the carriage with Yuanyuan, and the drums and music played, and the flags were arranged in rows, surrounding them in front and behind, all the way back to the brocade tent. San Gui said to Yuanyuan in the carriage: "I recognized your beautiful appearance in Tian's residence before, and I was amazed by your celestial beauty. Fortunately, Tian Wan agreed to give you to me, and I carried you back in a jeweled carriage. Who knew that just as I was realizing my beautiful dream, I had to sing a farewell song? I had just left the pass, and the capital had already been captured by the rebels? At that time, when I received the news that my family property had been confiscated, I thought that the wealth that came unexpectedly was not worth cherishing. As long as I returned to the capital, it would not be difficult to take it back. Later, when I heard that my father had been killed, I was not very worried, because he could not die for his country, and besides, he had already surrendered to Li Zicheng, and he could be pardoned sooner or later. At that time, he was still writing a letter to recruit me to surrender, and I was still a little hesitant in my heart. But as soon as I heard the bad news that you had been captured by the bandits, I vowed not to stand with the bandit Li, and I must take back my beloved, so that I would have no regrets. Today, my wish has finally come true, and the pearl has been returned. How can I not be overjoyed? But I don't know how you endured these difficult days after you fell into the hands of the bandits, and why Li Zicheng didn't take you away when he left. Isn't this God's will to bring us together again?" (249)</p>
