<h3 id="c11">第四次攻勢與反攻 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>從希特勒本月三日晚在柏林　演說，大家可以知道，在那時以前的四十八小時內，有一個「異常巨大的攻勢」，已經對蘇軍在加緊進行之中了。換句話說。牠是於一號晚上正式發動的，這就搆成了德軍第四决的猛烈攻勢。一週以來。牠不獨沒有造成相當的戰績。足以和以前三度的攻勢相比擬。甚至在有些地區。反因蘇軍的局部反攻。而被迫後退。不過希特勒本人宣稱。他這次攻勢是耍一擊敗」東方敵人的，所以牠動用的實在力量、當然未可輕視，也許會於長時間惡鬥後突然向某些點綫衝破前進，亦未可知。但如僅以這開始的一週結果而論。牠似乎已經足夠表明了：一方面。是德軍攻勢的力量一度比一度削弱；同時，蘇聯的抵抗力量因戰塲越向本國境內移轉，也就越見加强。目前最値得注意的。當然是希特勒發動這决攻勢的意義。在他的演辭中，他明白透露拆散英·美·蘇三國的合作為不可能、因而他這一决攻勢。比較起來，已經較少含有打擊蘇聯，逼牠儘先屈服前意思在內。那末餘下來的兩個可能目的，不是企圖澈底擊潰蘇聯軍事機構。就是企圖集甲力量攻擊一點，以便突出重圍。前者的實現，根本是不可能的，現在幾乎早已成為定論：比較有幾分前途的。看起來，還是由烏克蘭這一帶衝向近東及印度。所以德國這决攻勢進展的方向，現在就成了各方面注意集中的所在了。如果牠的目標是在於企圖撒底擊潰蘇聯軍事機構。那末。牠的前淮路綫應該是向蘇聯政治軍事等重心的京城莫斯科推進，或是由南北兩翼展開一個鉗形運動再或是由中央舉行突破的進攻。不然，假使牠打算突圍的話，那末，牠未來的前進路綫，大概不出於由克里米島到喀可夫這一帶的地區。然而面對着已經到來的冬季。德國要想在明年春季前取得決定勝利，無論如何，看上去是不可能的。</p>
<p>不過一等明年春季到來，事實上，那時問題的重心已不僅僅是德軍的主動進攻問題了。而更重要的，祇要今年冬季內蘇軍能夠非常有效地阻止德軍的前進，則那時英。蘇。兩軍聯合大反攻的發動，實在是非常的可能。依照最近英國駐美大使哈立法克斯在華盛頓的表示、英國朝野各方現在最關懷的，也就是這個攻勢的發動。接着，對於這一舉所以遲遲尙未出現的原因，他認為是由於運輸及配備沒有十分充足。因之在冬季戰事比較緩和的時期以內。英國方面勢必要動員一切力量，向着這個目標積極邁進。那是不待說的。不過我們必須知道，這個聯合總反攻的發動。並不是一個單純的技術及配備的問題，而實際上是含有更廣泛。更深刻的許多意義。譬如，最重要的一點。當然是在於國際政治方面。任何聯合反攻的發動。必須以在這一方面英·美·蘇三國完全的一致為前提。其次。是資源器械的溝通分配與負担的問題。再其次，是整個的戰略計劃及統一或協調指揮的機構。這些，都是搆成任何聯合攻勢發動前，最重要的大前提工作；經過這一决莫斯科會議之後，在基本上，似乎已經多半得了結論，今後僅剩比較决要的實際技術問題。隨時隨地都可以完全解決。而促進大反攻的實現。所以，莫斯科會議前為我們勢難合理期待出現的央·蘇聯合大反攻，從此後，却可以時時期待着，盼望着了。</p>
<p>比這總反攻發動更進一步的實際問題，不用說，應當是兩力面力量的對比。海軍方面。英·蘇兩國聯台力量或與美國總和的力量，顯然對德·義·兩國或德·義·日三國居於壓倒的優勢。空軍方面。德國現在最致命的地方，第一是在生產速率的落後。目前英·美·蘇三國每月的總產量，大概已達到六千架左右，尤其美國的產量，還未達最高峯；而德國呢，最多超不出兩千五百架。其决在消耗方面目下在這樣廣大的戰塲上，德國每月所損毀飛機的速率。已經空前地增加到兩千八百架左右，意思就是說，德國今後縱想維持現在的總機數，也不大可能了。還有一點，德國熟諳駕駛人員犧牲的慘重，使牠的補充問題日見嚴重起米。這當然主要是由於德國過去好多决濫用傘兵及空中兵團戰術，浪費牠本國人生命的結果。所以看起米，像克里特島那樣大規模的空中進攻，在德國方面，此後殆絕不可能、最後陸軍方面，正義陣綫各國的資源與人力，顯然的，遠過於侵略國家的總和。現在的問題，就在首先穩定各方面的戰局，然後在資源人力逐漸動員下。不久的將來，定有一天可以一舉而擊敗侵略者於廣大戰塲之上。</p>
<p>最後、與總決戰聯帶的，是美國的參戰問題。那時，不獨為了增加正義陣綫實力，同時即使為牠本身增强在世界重建工作中的地位，而取得決定的發言權。美國十之八九也要和上决歐戰中的情形一樣，於最後緊急決定的關頭，挺身一戰。</p>

<h3 id="c38">美使命團抵港　加強中國戰鬬力　中英美三國行動趨一致　若竟開釁以空戰決勝負　華軍事專家組成聯絡團會商策略 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>英美在菲島馬尼刺會議甫畢、美軍事使命團馬格魯德將軍一行繼之乘機抵達香港、眾信美國巳依照軍火租借法案規定、逐步對華實施援助、庶協助站在太平洋前哨之中國、為　由大局而奮鬥、</p>
<p>華軍事家　組聯絡團</p>
<p>大陸報昨載社評、論美國軍事使命團抵華事稱、美國初决派來中國之軍事使命團首腦馬格魯特少將、在馬尼刺參與美英軍事會議後、巳偕美國陸軍高級車官五員、行抵香港、彼等目前之計劃、固未可知、惟聞重慶華當局切望使命團即赴陪都、並巳派曾在美受訓之中國軍事專家、組成聯絡團、與該使命團合作</p>
<p>三國目的　完全一致</p>
<p>美國派軍事使命團來華、實乃中美英三國從事更廣大的積極的軍事合作、以擊敗日本之另一步驟、而上星期六馬尼刺之英美軍事會議、亦係朝同一方向前進之行動、其目的如東京報紙所言者為迫「使日本不得行動一、並加强反日包圍陣錢、馬尼刺會議與軍事使命團來華之目的、端在阻止日本之圖謀、無庸諱言、日方亦作此解、固正確無誤也、對日採取軍事行動之計劃、必巳擬定、是吾付諸實施、將視日本在最近將來之舉動而　、</p>
<p>空中武力　將決勝負</p>
<p>馬格魯特少將一行、乘美海軍轟炸機飛往香港一事、意義頗為重大、日本若竟與英美蘇開戰、則空中武力將決定戰局之勝負、空軍之打　力、巳較假想敵為弱、據若干專家之意、日本於無意中疏忽、未將其空軍發展至泰西各國空軍之標準、致日本在戰略上處於荏弱之地位、</p>
<p>最後戰局　漸見展開</p>
<p>各方對於美國軍事使命團之抵華、咸鄧歡迎、以其乃中國對日作戰的最後打的階段之開端也、中政府領袖極願在可能範圍內、對美英專家之一切軍事建議、予以最大之合作、際此納粹在歐侵略、迄未達其目的之時、中國人民因遠東之軸心與國亦將遭遇同樣之失敗、必大感振奮、</p>

<h3 id="c49">汽車經理商目光中之　滬市汽車業前途　汽油限額分配不影響營業　華人購車者日增存車售罄 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>據汽車業領袖稱、本埠汽車主購買汽油雖受限制、經理英美各廠出品之本埠汽車商、對於滬市汽車業前途、仍表示樂觀、一俟本月底大量汽油運抵本埠時、汽車界所遭遇之困難情形、當可迎刃而解矣、</p>
<p>汽油問題　可以樂觀</p>
<p>本埠領袖汽車行之職員、一致認為目前之汽油情勢、不足為慮、本埠之整個汽油業務、全視英美政府對於各廠製造一九二四年式汽車所採取之態度以為決定、本埠多數較大之汽車商、亦謂因現時無車可售、故不致受汽油限制之影響、惟據指稱、倘明年汽油情勢每况愈下、則即使一九四二年汽車裝運來滬、本埠汽車商亦必遭遇困難、以此項問題詢諸各汽車行職員、則大都表示樂觀、據稱、汽油供給情形、必逐漸好轉、而返於常態、</p>
<p>明年新車　紛紛預定</p>
<p>觀於滬市民衆在過去三年內購買汽車之踴躍情形、明年新車到滬時、必能繼續購貿、又悉、本埠主要汽車商、大都巳向英美各廠預定汽車、惟英美政府限制汽車出產量、是吾准許此項汽車輸入本埠、尙屬疑問、據本埠經營汽車業之商人稱、上海向為中國汽車交易之中心市塲、謂今後汽車將不准輸入中國、殊難使人置信、同時據稱、明年本埠汽車業或將異常發達、刻巳有多數主顧、定購一九四二年汽車、聞今日新主顧購買汽車時、立被介紹至本埠汽油公司、以便購取所需汽油、汽油商當吿以派給汽油份量、買主大概毫無異議、據稱凡自本埠主要汽車公司購買汽車者、均須同時在汽油公司登記、</p>
<p>限制進口　恐非事實</p>
<p>記者於調查本問題時、雖覺一般人均表示樂觀、然汽車商方面仍多少懷有若干疑慮、若干進口商對記者問話答稱、在進出口方面、不免有各種困難、且英美政府或有限制汽車工業之可能、惟據一再指稱、本埠汽油之限額分派制度、與本市汽車營業前途、無甚關係、即使現時之限制、繼續存在、對於汽車商亦不足為慮、但如汽油來源完全斷絕、則本埠汽車市塲當然全部停頓矣、惟吾人應知其他用油工業、將同受影響、恐英美政府未必願造成此種情勢也、</p>
<p>美生產額　成績驚人</p>
<p>通用汽車公司別克汽車公司總經理寇蒂斯最近宣稱、別克及其他汽車、在一九四二年將繼續運滬、此則本埠汽車商對於前途表示樂觀之一種原因、美國各大汽車公司、除福特外、均已停止製造一九四一年汽車、聞福特公司將遵照原定計劃、繼續出品至上月底為止、但此事僅足影響一九四一年美國汽車之出產量、美國雜誌載稱、汽油問題雖變化莫測、美國汽油工業繼續表現驚人之成績、即此一事、巳足表示美國對於一九四二年國內外汽車出產量及汽汕售賣、抱有樂覜、</p>
<p>汽車需要　有增無减</p>
<p>某汽車同謂、美國多數汽車廠雖已從事於戰時生產、一九四二年美國汽車　業仍有發達之希望、此為本埠汽車商對於來年汽車業表示樂觀之另一原因、在過去三年問、上海向為汽車銷售之中心市塲、自滬戰停止以後、重大卡車及私人汽車之需要大為增加、允其私人汽車之需求、隨戰時致富者之增加以俱增、木埠各式汽車之經理商、預料一九四二年汽車之需求量將有增無巳</p>
<p>推銷計劃　已經擬定</p>
<p>據稱、輪入上海之各式汽車、幾已銷售一空、華人購者允夥、上海之汽車業、在本市商業中常佔重要地位、英美油公司中國經理處之發售汽油、大半依賴私有汽車主、而以滬市之汽油需求量為最大、倘滬市汽車業因英美政府限制國外工廠而受打擊、則汽油公司必將迺受重大之打擊、現本埠各主要汽車公司、巳擬具一九四二年汽車推銷計劃、其詳情此時尙無從探悉、</p>

<p>檢察官決　提出證據</p>
<p>檢察官希爾茲起稱、訴肤中所列一款、均屬一罪、依據法律規定、該罪之最高判刑、為監禁十年或罰金一個萬元、或兩者並科、檢察官繼向庭上稱、渠擬提出證據、證明被吿於一九四〇年十二月間失業、當時眾有友人二人、其一即為此問執行吏李却生、另一為不知姓名之非美國人、彼時李却生向被吿稱、執行吏彼得遜不久將辭退、被吿或可遞補其職、泰脫龐接獲此一消息後、即與另一友人接洽稱渠如能就任執行吏後、每年可得官俸美金一千八百元、另加房貼美金六十二元、故託共友人設法覓取指紋三組、及照片三幀、</p>
<p>案情牽涉　李却生氏</p>

<h3 id="c77">如何推進舊書運動 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 朱文斛</p>
<p>採用循環傳遞制度</p>
<p>子弟的學費固是家長的一個重大負擔，然就書籍費一項而言，亦未始小是一個重大負擔。那般淸寒的學生們，更難以支持。即使學費由助學金啦，獎學金啦，免費額啦代為付淸，保送進學，然而書籍還是要自買的。進了學校而無書可讀，那是不可能的事。於是一般淸寒的學生們，不免踟蹰舊書攤頭，手摸着口袋，心有餘而力不足，眞够可憐！</p>
<p>事實是這樣，書價的飛黃騰達，不僅加重家長負擔，威脅淸苦學生的失學，即如大學敎授，小學敎員也莫不受其影響，，這實在是文化界當前急需解決的問題，特在此為困難學生呼籲，希望各界有以協助之。</p>
<p>目下正是舊書運動澎湃的時候，不少社會熱心人士籌劃種種方法，去推行這個運動。例如：交換舊書——這雖不失為一個良好方法；但這批書祇限於比較高深些的，或專門科的。中學大學中是可以推行的，中學以下未必見效，因為中學以下敎科書，事實上是漫無系統的，各校用不同書局所出版的書。這樣，交換書籍就不易「兩相吻合」。</p>
<p>此外，亦有人往圖書館裹借書，權常課本，這祇是臨時的辦法。</p>
<p>以我管見，治本的辦法，就是施行所謂「循環傳遞制度」。這個制度推進的方式有兩種：一種是由學生來擔當；另一種是廣義的，是由學生，學校及社會人士共同協助的。</p>
<p>第一種方法，由學校方面購買大批書籍，分配給每個學生，而每個學生在學期終了的時候，仍歸還學校，到了下學期開學時，學校當局又可分發各學生。周而復始，添新換舊。不是可以維持幾個學期嗎？維持添新換舊的費用，祇需極少的數目就够小斷地購買新書，中學，大學均可依法辦理。如此自小舉第一學年第一學期起，以至大學畢業止，書籍費總計很少，不然，雖千數百元亦不够。</p>
<p>第　種方法。這是一種更有效的方法，就是由畢業班學生們發起，捐出一部或全部讀過的書，或課本以外的書，作為紀念母校，（將來他需用的時候，仍可用通訊方法或親自到校借讀）。另一意義，就是「集腋成裘』，「嘉惠後學」，校方對捐者，應予相當的獎勵。此舉且能響應全校的學生，師長，甚至離校已久同學們，更可以得社會上一般熱心敎育人士的援助。而在校的同學祇犧牲一學期或一學年讀過的舊書，便可享受無限的便利。</p>
<p>現在我希望，這兩種方法最好能够同時進行，那麼可以很快的得到效果。這個制度，應當由小學儘先採用，讓學生們，從小就可以養成習慣。使他們，直接知道愛惜公物，有責任心，有互助心；間接可以養成惻隱心——這都是做人的基礎。非但因此增進學生與學校間的聯繫；亚目學校方面，可以藉此機會來充實圖書館。所以，今後學生們所要高喊的，「學校是我，我是學校」，不是空談了。</p>
<p>總之，在現時代，生產者固然應當竭力節的；消費者，更應非常刻苦，節省物力財力，對得起我們的國家。</p>

<p>說到包龍圖，至今猶無人不知，小說戲劇之力量眞大。宋代置殿閣學士官，殿為觀文殿，崇政殿等等。閣有龍圖閣，天章閣，寳文閣等十一閣，皆設有學士，直學士，待制，等官。包拯嘗為龍圖閣直學士，故後世俱知有包龍圖，而竟有以龍圖為其名者。但在宋時，童稚婦孺，莫不知有包待制，蓋以包拯曾為天章閣待制，知諫院，數論斥權倖大臣，是以直聲振天下，婦稚咸知，故稱為包待制。再擢為龍圖閣直學士。其後以喪子，乞便郡，乃命其知揚州，蓋包拯為廬州合肥人，故以揚州為便。又徙廬州池州，遂自江寗府，召權知開封府。開封府府尹，在宋時，為親民官之最尊者；宋太祖時，命太宗為開封府尹，因之共地位甚高貴。包拯性剛毅，不畏權勢，能為民除害，貴戚權宦，見之無不歛手，聞包拯名，莫不畏憚，故當時以「包拯笑比黃河淸，」極言其難得也，想見其鐵板面孔，絲毫不肯容情之神氣。是以京師（即開封）為之語曰：「關節不到，有閻羅包老。」蓋世俗以閻羅王為最不畏權勢，無論為殺人不眨眼的魔王，富貴尊榮的帝王享盡人世快樂的達官富商，日夜思算計人的奸刁巨豪，以及損人利己，爭權奪勢，與夫乞丐飢民，瘪三苦力，在人世間强凌弱衆暴寡，惟有閻王一視同仁，勾魂票一出，不能用人力，財力，權力，武力，女色力，惡勢力，能勾通搪塞過去，所謂「閻王料定三更死，斷不留人到五更，」纔用閻羅來比仿包拯之嚴正，乃竟有以包拯為閻羅王，尸屬可笑。更有以閻羅王尙且包庇屬下弄權舞弊，濫死無辜，編成包龍圖鍘判官一戲，以見包龍圖比閻王還要公正嚴明，此皆後人借以譏世諷俗，不可當實有其事觀。</p>

<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>近年來，文藝小說搬上舞台攝成影片的，着實不少，但像「家」那樣偉大的產物，却不多覯，而角色支配之得宜，陣容之堅强，允為我國電影史上年來所未曾有過的，我們對此中國影壇空前歷史性的豪舉，表示極大感奮。</p>
<p>正角方面：姜明的高老太爺，王元龍的高克文，黎明的高克明，梅熹的覺新，劉瓊的覺民，顧也魯的張惠如等，都能合乎理想，但是王引的覺慧，在年齡上似乎太「老氣」了，個性倒還相合。反角方面：允能使我們興奮，洪警鈴的克安，王獻齋的克定，實無懈可擊。女角方面：胡蝶的淑雲，陳雲裳的張蘊華，袁美雲的錢梅，陳燕燕的鳴鳳，顧蘭君的李瑞珏，張婉的陳姨太，李紅的淑華，陳娟娟的淑貞等等：也都就各人個性，演技而分配。其他如徐莘園的張師長，韓蘭根的張公子，殷秀岑的馮樂山，袁竹如的周氏，童月娟的婉兒，顧梅君的喜兒等等：也能使我們滿意。雖然照嚴格地說，這樣的陣容，還不是最最優秀的，可是一般的，已能合乎我們的理想了。</p>

<p>— 貝士</p>
<p>「蜆變」是曹禺先生戰時的傑作，他的作品，始終把握着時代意義的。巴金曾經說過下面一段關於「蛻變」的話：「從『雷雨』起，我就是他的作品最初的讀者他的每一本戲都是經過我和另一個朋友的手送到讀者面前的。他相信我們，如人相信他的眞實的朋友。但這本「蛻變」却是例外。牠到我的眼前時，劇中人物和故事已經成了各處知識份子談話的資料了。我攤開油印稿本在昆明西城角寄寓的電燈下一口氣讀完了「蜆變」，我忘記夜深，忘記眼痛，忘記疲倦，我心里充滿了快樂，我眼前閃爍着光亮，作者的確給我們帶來了希望。」</p>
<p>巴金的話，確是我們心中要說的，在「蛻變」中出塲的人物里，每人都具獨特的風格，譬如正義的梁專員，勇敢的丁大夫，以及淘汰中的秦院長馬主任等等，這些人物，代表着非常時期中的兩代人，曹禺所以用「蜆變」劇名者，就是說：舊的沒落了，新的起來了。</p>
<p>「蜆變」雖寫後方醫院的一瞥，但祗如巴金說：「作者的確給我們帶來了希望。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Another Victory Reported After the Great Victory in Northern Hunan: Chinese Troops in Western Hubei Capture Yichang, Recovered Strongholds in the Suburbs of Zhengzhou, War Situation Stabilized, Remnants of Japanese Isolated Forces on the South Bank of the Miluo River Completely Eliminated <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, after a lightning attack by the Chinese army, they entered Yichang this morning and street fighting is ongoing. The above news has not yet been officially confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing A Central News Agency report stated that the Chinese army has captured Yichang and has been engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army since dawn this morning. A Chinese military spokesman said that he has not yet received confirmation of this news, but revealed that the Chinese army is only one mile away from this important Yangtze River port in Hubei Province. When the Central News Agency news spread, the public was extremely happy, because the recovery of Yichang will have a very good impact on the economic life of Free China. As Chinese people spread the news that Yichang would soon be recovered, prices here fell sharply, and those who had hoarded goods were also prepared to sell them. Reliable Chinese sources had predicted that the Chinese army could enter Yichang tonight. These sources said that due to the fierce attacks by the Chinese army, and because troops had been dispatched to Manchuria and northern Hunan, the garrison in Yichang had been reduced, and they were now on the verge of collapse. These sources also said that the Japanese army had set fires in Yichang a few days ago, which indicated their intention to retreat. Yesterday, four Japanese planes near Yichang attacked Chinese army positions, and one was shot down by the Chinese army. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing A telegram from the Chinese side in Luoyang today stated that the Chinese army has withdrawn from Rongze, 15 kilometers northwest of Zhengzhou. Although there are continuing battles in the areas south of the city and southeast of Zhengzhou, it is believed that the situation in that area has become stable. As for the Changsha battle, it seems to be nearing its end. However, the Chinese telegram still mentioned that Chinese troops pursuing the enemy had inflicted losses on the Japanese army north of the Miluo River. Another report stated that the Japanese army had parachuted paratroopers near Xiangyin, aiming to rescue the surrounded Japanese troops, but the number of these paratroopers was very small, and they were wiped out by the Chinese army after landing. The surrounded Japanese troops are also being quickly eliminated. It is also reported that the Japanese army retreated by boat from the Miluo River, and many boats were sunk by Chinese artillery fire, resulting in heavy losses. The Japanese troops isolated on the south bank of the Miluo River have been completely eliminated. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing The battle in the Zhengzhou area is fierce. After the Chinese army received reinforcements, it continued to launch counterattacks against the Japanese army yesterday, engaging in bayonet charges, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. Many strongholds in the suburbs of Zhengzhou have now been recovered, and the Japanese cavalry in the city are being besieged. The invading Japanese troops in Rongze also suffered casualties due to Chinese ambushes. By last night, most of them had been driven out and retreated north. The struggle between the two sides in the villages south of Zhongmu is also fierce. Most of the Japanese advance troops have been repelled. Chinese reinforcements have recently crossed the Jialu River, attacking the Japanese flanks. A part of the reinforcements is also continuously heading east from Luoyang along the Longhai Railway. The front-line situation will unfold within days. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing A military spokesman reported today that the Japanese side's decision to use troops in northern Hunan, in addition to the original division stationed in Yueyang, was to transfer troops from western and northern Hubei and Jiangxi Province. Therefore, the Chinese army had feigned offensives towards Yichang and between Suixian and Xinyang, while the Japanese telegrams feared that the Chinese side would transfer northern forces to attack Zhengzhou to contain them. Therefore, the Zhengzhou battle is not very important. Currently, the Japanese troops on the northern Hunan front have retreated to the Miluo River. It is feared that those who have crossed the river are less than 20,000. The troops remaining on the south bank have considerable combat power, so the northern Hunan battle has not ended. The Chinese army will not be complacent because of this initial victory, nor will it slacken its efforts, but will strive to inflict a major blow in the short term, and then report the results of this battle. As for those who recently landed in Yingtan and Xiangyin, they were Japanese naval landing forces. Their main task was because a large number of wounded soldiers remained near those places and could not be transported away, so they were taken away by ships. At the same time, it did not play a role in covering the Japanese retreat. It has now been driven away by the Chinese army. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Changsha The Japanese troops who retreated from Xiangshi Guiyi launched another attempt to break out to the west on the 5th. Their boats and ships prepared for escape were subjected to concentrated artillery fire by the Chinese army and were mostly destroyed. A small number of Japanese troops who fled towards the Jiangmian area between Yingtan and Xiangyin were also repelled by the Chinese army. Japanese warships and transport ships sailing from outside the mouth of the Xiang River came to pick up these defeated Japanese troops. The Chinese army followed and chased them to the river bank, and fired with intense firepower on the river bank, sinking many Japanese warships. As a result, the Japanese troops downstream of the Miluo River who resisted were completely eliminated. (Dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Dr. Laughlin Currie, Economic Envoy of President Roosevelt, arrived here today from Chongqing, accompanied by Fox, the American representative of the Chinese Stabilization Fund. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Laughlin Currie, an expert dispatched by the US Treasury Department to the Far East to investigate the economic situation, stated today that what he had noticed during his recent travels in the Far East was how to ensure that the ABCD democratic group obtained raw materials, and at the same time prevent raw materials from falling into the hands of the Axis powers. Currie, who represents the Federal Loan Agency and works directly under Jones of the Department of Commerce, arrived here by plane from Chongqing today to participate in the tripartite economic conference to be held here this week regarding the exchange of raw materials needed for American defense. Currie stated that what he was concerned about was transporting goods to the Far East and transporting raw materials back to the United States. Currie revealed that the Dutch East Indies and Malaya urgently needed equipment for tin mining, so he would return home to report and promptly supply this equipment. Currie said that there were two aspects to the supply of raw materials, namely, how we obtain raw materials and how to prevent the Axis powers from obtaining raw materials. Currie expressed his belief that the increase in ABCD bases in the Pacific, mainly Cavite, Surabaya, Singapore, Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam, The defense situation is quite satisfactory. Currie also said that his trip to Chongqing was to encourage the flow of raw materials. He said, "We have a contract with the Chinese government for a certain number of minerals, and the Chinese side is very satisfied with the delivery of this contract. We hope this delivery can be faster. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing US Assistant Secretary of State Laughlin Currie flew to Hong Kong by plane at 7 p.m. on the 6th, accompanied by Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Fund Committee, and Yang, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance. Those who went to the airport to see them off included Ling Qihan, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wu Jingchao, secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Zou Bingwen, Deputy Chairman of the Trade Commission, and Wang Yingbao, representative of the Foreign Exchange Management Committee.

He visited various industrial constructions in the four suburbs of Chongqing, met with various Chinese authorities multiple times, and discussed with the economic and transportation authorities regarding the supply and transportation of Chinese materials necessary for American defense. Foreign Minister Guo, at today's reception for reporters, praised Currie's trip, saying that it was "a mutually beneficial trip of four days." After arriving in Hong Kong, Currie plans to stay for two days and is scheduled to fly to Manila on the 8th, and then fly directly back to Washington from Manila on the 17th to report to President Roosevelt on his trip to the Far East.

<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Letter: Transmitted to Roosevelt by Currie</p>
<p>Hong Kong Laughlin Currie, Personal Economic Envoy of President Roosevelt, spoke to reporters tonight about his trip to the Far East, saying that the confidence of the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and the Philippines had greatly increased. Currie concluded his four-day visit to Chongqing this morning and flew here, accompanied by Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Fund Committee, and Yang, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance. According to him, he felt deeply that the defenses of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies had been greatly strengthened compared to a year ago, and that the various American bases in the Pacific were also becoming stronger. Wherever he went, he felt that it would be very difficult for any country to drive straight in. Currie also said that he had an interesting conversation with General Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, and Chiang asked him to convey a certain letter to President Roosevelt. In addition, he had satisfactory discussions with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Economic Minister Weng Wenhao. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Singapore Dr. Romulo, publisher of the Manila Herald Tribune, told a Central News Agency reporter this morning that he believed that the Sino-Japanese War could end within two years, and that China would be on the victorious side. He said that this belief was based on his talks with General Chiang Kai-shek, Chief of Staff He, and Foreign Minister Guo, as well as various information he obtained in Chongqing, which stated that the Sino-Japanese War and the European War were inseparable. Events in Europe that are unfavorable to the Axis powers will also be unfavorable to Japan. The situation on the Burma Road is quite good. Japanese bombing of the road is ineffective. The Chinese repair teams on the road are very efficient. Romulo arrived in Singapore yesterday, and had previously visited Rangoon, Bangkok, and Vietnam. He is scheduled to transfer to the Dutch East Indies within days. During his stay in Singapore, he will visit Malayan Governor Thomas, British Commander-in-Chief Popeong, and inspect Singapore's defenses. He is scheduled to return to Manila in early December.

<p>Northern Hunan Front A group of foreign reporters departing from Chongqing arrived on the northern Hunan front yesterday. Japanese planes are very active, in addition to bombing the Guangdong-Han Railway between Hengyang and Changsha, and other locations in the Changsha area, they are also circling and reconnaissance over the Changsha area all day long. On Sunday, nine Japanese planes bombed the railway north of Hengyang, and on Monday, there were 20 planes circling over Nanyue (south of Changsha), where Hengshan is located. The group of foreign reporters only stayed in Guilin for two hours and immediately boarded a specially prepared Douglas passenger plane to leave for the northern Hunan front. The streets of Guilin are crowded with pedestrians and the shops are piled high with goods, making it one of the most prosperous cities in the southwest. The situation in Hengyang is very different because of the repeated bombing by Japanese planes. Residents go out of the city to hide in the countryside in the morning and only return in the evening. All shops are only open at night. When the reporters went to the front, they saw that the Chinese army's transportation organization had obviously improved. There were very few troops in the towns and cities, and the wounded were quickly cared for and transported to the rear hospitals. At the same time, because the traffic south of Changsha has been systematically destroyed by the Chinese army, it may take some time for the traffic on the rivers and roads to return to normal. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Hengyang After the foreign reporters and military attachés of various countries' embassies departed from Guilin by special train last night, although the weather was hot, the cool breeze at night was quite refreshing. The members of each group did not feel tired and chatted happily in the car. Looking at the bright moon, the fertile fields stretched for thousands of miles, and they all deeply praised this beautiful land. They fell asleep at midnight, and the car moved forward smoothly the next morning. The excellent spirit of the service personnel and the completeness of the station facilities along the way were praised by the members of each group. The passenger trains between Heng and Gui were running as usual, and the number of freight trains surprised the members of the group. They said that it was commendable that traffic could be maintained so calmly near the front, and that it already had a modern transportation scale. Whenever the special train exchanged trains, the members of each group constantly asked about the situation of the people's evacuation in case of emergency. The stationmaster and employees all spoke frankly and said that there was no emergency phenomenon on the Henggui Road. Even on the Hengchang Road, it was not tense. The people of Hunan were very calm and had the strongest confidence in the battle. After the reporters entered Hengyang City to inspect, they became more convinced of this report. When the car arrived in the Santang area, everyone was talking about the heroic deeds of the Chinese generals and soldiers who were shedding blood and killing the Japanese, especially the story of a sergeant who woke up in his sleep and killed a Japanese officer and eight soldiers, and captured important Japanese operational documents. The reporters were most excited after hearing this. When the car arrived in Hengyang, the reporters followed the inspection group into the city. When they met some wounded soldiers on the road, they went forward to comfort them. Seeing the scars all over their bodies, they were not very conscious of them. According to the talk, it was the result of hand-to-hand combat. They were full of energy, with smiles on their faces, and competed to tell about the situation of killing the Japanese. The members of each group expressed their admiration and frequently comforted them. Hengyang City is commercially prosperous and densely populated, with a secondary capital, making it difficult to believe that this is an important town close to the front. At that time, the reporter took Commander Xue's car, and his driver frequently told about the heroic battles on the front. When I mentioned Mrs. Xue, he repeatedly said that Mrs. Xue was really brave. When the Japanese disguised troops entered the outskirts of Changsha, she was still in the city assisting the commander in his work. She only came to Hengyang to evacuate women and children, and she has already gone to the front to慰勞 the troops. The car passed north of Hengyang and met He Yiming, the Director of the Traffic Office. He told the reporter that the bravery of the Hunanese children has not started today. In the past, they assisted in the transportation of military food, and hundreds of thousands of people had been dispatched. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Guilin Chairman Huang Xuchu attended the Prime Minister's Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th and reported on the Northern Hunan Campaign and the comparison of the two campaigns. He said that the Japanese had no thorough preparations in the first campaign, but they had sufficient preparations in this campaign, with more than 100,000 troops, equipped with paratroopers, and strong strength, but they retreated in less than ten days, which proves that China's combat strength is becoming stronger and stronger.

<h3 id="e11">The Fourth Offensive and Counter-Offensive <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>From Hitler's speech in Berlin on the evening of the 3rd of this month, it is clear that in the 48 hours prior to that, an "exceptionally large offensive" had been intensified against the Soviet forces. In other words, it was officially launched on the evening of the 1st, constituting the German army's fierce fourth offensive. For a week, it has not only failed to achieve comparable results to the previous three offensives, but in some areas, it has even been forced to retreat due to local counter-offensives by the Soviet army. However, Hitler himself declared that this offensive was aimed at "defeating" the enemy in the East, so the actual strength he has deployed should not be underestimated. It is possible that after a prolonged and fierce struggle, he may suddenly break through and advance at certain points or lines. But based solely on the results of this first week, it seems to be sufficient to indicate that, on the one hand, the strength of the German offensive is weakening with each attempt; at the same time, the Soviet Union's resistance is strengthening as the battlefield shifts further into its own territory. The most noteworthy aspect at present is, of course, the significance of Hitler launching this offensive. In his speech, he clearly revealed that breaking up the cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is impossible. Therefore, this offensive contains less of an intention to strike at the Soviet Union and force it to surrender as a priority. Then, the remaining two possible objectives are either to attempt to completely destroy the Soviet military apparatus or to concentrate forces to attack a single point in order to break through the encirclement. The former is fundamentally impossible, and this has almost become a foregone conclusion. The latter, which seems to have some prospect, is to advance from the vicinity of Ukraine towards the Near East and India. Therefore, the direction of progress of this German offensive has now become the focus of attention for all parties. If its goal is to attempt to completely destroy the Soviet military apparatus, then its advance route should be to push towards Moscow, the Soviet capital and center of politics and military affairs, or to launch a pincer movement from the north and south flanks, or to carry out a breakthrough attack from the center. Otherwise, if it intends to break through, then its future advance route will probably be in the area from Crimea to Kharkov. However, facing the already arrived winter, it seems impossible for Germany to achieve a decisive victory before next spring, no matter what.</p>
<p>However, once next spring arrives, in fact, the focus of the problem at that time will not only be the German army's initiative in launching an offensive. More importantly, as long as the Soviet army can very effectively prevent the German army from advancing this winter, then the launch of a joint large-scale counter-offensive by the British and Soviet armies at that time is very possible. According to the recent remarks of British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in Washington, what all parties in Britain are most concerned about now is the launch of this offensive. Subsequently, regarding the reasons why this move has been delayed, he believes that it is due to insufficient transportation and equipment. Therefore, during the relatively mild period of winter warfare, the British side must mobilize all forces to actively move towards this goal. That goes without saying. However, we must know that the launch of this joint general counter-offensive is not a simple issue of technology and equipment, but actually contains many broader and more profound meanings. For example, the most important point, of course, lies in the international political aspect. The launch of any joint counter-offensive must be premised on the complete agreement of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in this area. Secondly, there is the issue of communication, distribution, and burden-sharing of resources and equipment. Furthermore, there is the overall strategic plan and the unified or coordinated command structure. These are the most important prerequisites for launching any joint offensive. After this Moscow conference, it seems that most of them have been concluded in principle, and only the more decisive practical technical issues remain. They can be completely resolved at any time and anywhere, thus promoting the realization of a large-scale counter-offensive. Therefore, the large-scale British-Soviet joint counter-offensive, which was difficult for us to reasonably expect before the Moscow conference, can now be expected and hoped for at any time.</p>
<p>A more practical issue than the launch of this general counter-offensive is, needless to say, the comparison of strength between the two sides. In the naval aspect, the combined forces of Britain and the Soviet Union, or the combined forces of the United States, clearly have an overwhelming advantage over Germany and Italy, or Germany, Italy, and Japan. In the air force aspect, Germany's most fatal weakness now is, first, the lag in production rates. Currently, the total monthly output of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is probably around 6,000 aircraft, and the output of the United States in particular has not yet reached its peak; while Germany's maximum output does not exceed 2,500 aircraft. In terms of consumption, the rate at which Germany is destroying aircraft each month on such a vast battlefield has unprecedentedly increased to around 2,800 aircraft, meaning that it is unlikely that Germany will be able to maintain its current total number of aircraft in the future. Another point is that the heavy losses of German experienced pilots have made its replenishment problem increasingly serious. This is of course mainly due to Germany's past abuse of paratroopers and airborne corps tactics, wasting the lives of its own people. Therefore, it seems that large-scale airborne offensives like the one in Crete are almost impossible for Germany in the future. Finally, in the army aspect, the resources and manpower of the just alliance are clearly far greater than the sum of the aggressor countries. The current issue is to first stabilize the war situation in all aspects, and then, with the gradual mobilization of resources and manpower, there will surely come a day when the aggressors can be defeated in one fell swoop on the vast battlefield.</p>
<p>Finally, linked to the general decisive battle is the issue of the United States' participation in the war. At that time, not only to increase the strength of the just alliance, but also to enhance its own position in the world reconstruction work and gain a decisive voice, the United States will in all likelihood, as in the last European war, stand up and fight at the final critical moment.</p>

<p>Reuters, Singapore, 7th. Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, returned here by air last night in high spirits. He was very pleased with the results of his trip to Manila. In addition to meeting with Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and other US defense leaders, Sir Robert personally witnessed the many improvements in the Philippine defenses in recent months, which are still under development. Sir Robert discussed with the leaders many issues of common interest to Britain and the United States, and also considered with Lieutenant General Magruder, head of the US military mission to Chongqing, how to effectively organize the transportation of supplies from the United States to aid the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 7th. Moore, a well-known foreign reporter who accompanied the Magruder military mission to Chongqing, told a Reuters reporter today that the mission will do everything possible to help China, except for the United States actually going to war with Japan. The mission will offer advice on the use of transportation Australia supplies, will teach the Chinese how to use artillery and airplanes, and will probably also build a platform for how the American giant fighter planes and volunteer pilots can be used most effectively. If the work is heavy, the mission can increase the necessary staff at any time, without limiting the number. Moore crossed the Pacific to get here and will go to Kaiji in the next few days.</p>
<p>Hong Kong. General Magruder, head of the US military mission, told reporters today that the United States has allocated huge sums of money to aid China in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. The US industrial zone is concentrating all its efforts to implement the provisions of the aid-China plan. The purpose of this mission is to find the most effective way to aid China with all its strength in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. Mr. Ma's brief remarks were limited to technical matters, and he did not discuss other military matters because he was instructed by the Army Department not to. Mr. Ma is 54 years old this year. He served twice as a military attaché at the embassy in China from 1920 to 1914 and from 1926 to 1930, and is a capable talent in the Army Department. He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute. The current members of the delegation in Hong Kong are: MacMillan, Tweedle, Sutherland, Prina, Cottrell, Trettel, and others, nine in total.

<p>Singapore. Mr. Moller, a famous American reporter, came to Singapore on a clipper plane from Guam with General Magruder, head of the US military mission, a few days ago. It is said that the United States' dispatch of a military mission to China is its most valuable way of assisting China. The delegation will seek to assist China with various strategies other than the United States participating in the war against Japan. General Magruder told me that the delegation will be stationed at Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters and will increase the number of personnel in the delegation at any time depending on the needs of the situation. Mr. Moore said that China is an unconquerable country, and the dawn of China has already arrived. (Electric message on the 6th)</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 7th. Sir Earl Page, the Australian Cabinet representative to London who arrived here yesterday, met with General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Army, for a long time this morning. According to the headquarters, the talks were in the nature of an exchange of information on prisoner affairs, including affairs from all over the world. This decision talk has no special political significance. However, it happened to be held because Page passed through here on his way to London.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th. Japanese newspapers are taking the meetings held by senior British and American military officers in Manila as an effort to complete the encirclement of Japan. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" believes that this decision is aimed at strengthening many weaknesses in the British and American encirclement of Japan. The "Asahi Shimbun" believes that the issue of cooperation between Italy and Myanmar must also be discussed. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that holding this meeting at a time when Japan and the United States hope to peacefully resolve various issues between the two countries is extremely inappropriate, as it will give people the impression that a Pacific war cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 7th. Qualified observers said yesterday that Japan's failure to prove that the government is strong enough to control the military has led to "the threat of failure in the Tokyo-Washington talks. Some believe that the Japanese army opposes the government's search for understanding with the United States or intends to create incidents in China to prevent any third country from coming forward to mediate the Far East situation. This move has been seen repeatedly in the past. It is also said that the United States is now trying to prove that the Japanese army can be controlled. If this guarantee cannot be obtained, then it is generally believed that the current US-Japan negotiations will fail. Observers also said that the situation in China can be used to get a glimpse of what will happen in the diplomatic field. If the Japanese army does something that damages the interests of the United States, then the talks will fail. It is learned that the State Department has sent a telegram to Chongqing to inquire about the alleged bombing of an American church in Guangdong Province by Japanese planes. The Japanese army's attacks in Changsha and Zhengzhou may also complicate the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th. Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Wei An Yi told foreign reporters this morning that there have been no new developments in the US-Japan negotiations in Washington. In reply to a question, he said that he knew nothing about the report that Ambassador Nomura had discussed the conclusion of a shipping agreement with Secretary of State Hull. In reply to another question, he admitted that trade between Japan and Malaya had virtually come to a standstill. Japan is currently working hard to maintain and increase trade with Latin America.</p>

<p>London. It is believed here that Japan's recent actions in Vietnam are a phenomenon in its "digestion" of Vietnam. Those with inside information said that some of the recent events in Vietnam have hinted at its future trend. First, Japan's seizure of warehouses and civilian houses near the Saigon pier is an indication that Japan is disregarding French sovereignty and using force to achieve its goals. It also proves that Japanese soldiers are using coercive means to force the government to occupy the entire Vietnam. Second, Japan's arrest of overseas Chinese and other actions are deliberate actions aimed at making overseas people believe that Japan is the true owner of Vietnam and reflecting the incompetence of the French authorities. Third, in order to "promote" French-Japanese trade, Japan has implemented a monopoly system. As a result, the so-called trade only benefits Japan. Japanese ships sailing to Vietnam come empty and leave fully loaded with food, rice, rubber and other supplies. This is probably a manifestation of Japan's seizing Vietnam's rich resources.

Tungsten, which is used to make high-speed rate tools, comes from the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Mica, which is used to make tanks and airplanes, comes from India. In addition, the United States, India, and the Philippines all produce manganese for military use. The United States cannot allow the transportation lines of these materials to be blockaded. China currently has 3 million troops, who are well-trained and have complete officers. The guerrillas who are bothering the lone front lines of the invaders in various provinces are not included. Anyone who has traveled to China knows how fragile the invaders' occupation is. China will surely win.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Central Route German Army Launches Offensive, Attempting to Peer into Moscow; German Offensive on Crimean Front Again Thwarted; German Pressure Around Leningrad Eases <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The Soviet war, now in its sixteenth week, is seeing its fiercest battles along the entire 1,500-mile front. The Soviets are exerting all their strength to resist the German offensive, while the Germans are also using all their military power in an operation aimed at capturing Moscow. According to recent reports, Soviet forces are currently containing the German war machine, and both sides claim to have achieved local victories. The main German force is now concentrated on the north and south sides of Smolensk in the central sector, where General Timoshenko's Soviet troops have launched a counteroffensive. The Germans are launching an unprecedented large-scale pincer movement, with two starting points south of Valdai Hills (200 miles northwest of Moscow) and the city of Roslavl (113 miles southwest of Moscow), aiming to encircle the Soviet forces led by Timoshenko while attempting to capture Moscow. The German forces advancing towards Kharkov are also aggressive, but Moscow claims that the enemy has now been stopped near Poltava (80 miles southwest of Kharkov). This is due to the reinforcements received by General Budyonny's forces, which have enabled a successful counteroffensive. This Soviet force has also contained the German left flank advancing on Crimea, forcing the German forces to fight on two fronts. The German pressure around Leningrad has eased. Moscow claims that the city is no longer in imminent danger of being occupied, and road and rail traffic remain open. Moscow Radio reported that savings bank activity in Leningrad has significantly increased in the past ten days, with new depositors. The besieged city of Odessa on the Black Sea coast continues to repel the attacking enemy forces. Soviet naval paratroopers have landed behind the Romanian lines, using automatic rifles, grenades, and bayonets to wipe out multiple enemy units. A recent Soviet communiqué stated that fierce fighting occurred along the entire front yesterday. On October 4th, 63 enemy aircraft were destroyed, while the Soviets lost 25 aircraft. In the Barents Sea, a German transport ship was sunk.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 7th – A Swedish newspaper citing Berlin dispatches reports that the German army always conducts large-scale air raids before attacking Soviet troops to disrupt Soviet rear communications. Hitler's recent so-called major offensive is intended to encircle Moscow, but in any case, the German objective is to reach the Volga River line before winter, with Moscow also being one of its targets. The battle for Kharkov is still ongoing. Berlin sources believe it is the first line of defense in the Perekop Isthmus. Once broken, the gateway to Crimea will be more than half open.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th – The Soviet Information Bureau announced that the battle report for the night of the 6th and 7th stated that on the 4th, our forces and the enemy engaged in intense fighting along the entire line. Sixty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed on the 4th, of which 53 were shot down in air combat, and 10 were destroyed at the airfield. A German cargo ship was sunk in the Barents Sea.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th – The German High Command issued a report stating that German air fleets bombed the port of Rostov on the Black Sea coast (the port is at the mouth of the Don River) for the first time today. The situation is intense in the Sea of Azov. The entire staff of the Red Army's 9th Corps was captured, and the corps commander escaped by plane.</p>
<p>Italian Reports Near Leningrad Harbor: Hundreds of Soviet Ships Attack German Positions</p>
<p>International News, London, 7th – British wireless listeners heard a report last night relaying news from the People's Daily stating, "Hundreds of Soviet warships" bombarded German positions in the Leningrad area. The Soviet garrison in that area now totals two million, "protected by countless latest-model fighter planes. The mission of these fighter planes is to engage the Germans attacking Soviet positions." The Daily Herald carried news from Stockholm that the German army is trying to conduct a blitzkrieg on Moscow. The German army is deploying a large-scale pincer formation to open a new front. Its troops are now beginning to advance from the northwest and south. Soviet equipment remains excellent, and the situation on the northern and southern fronts has also improved.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 7th – The battles of the past two weeks, especially since the fall of Bryansk, have been chaotic, but it can now be said that the situation in the central sector of the front has greatly improved and is promising. After the fall of Kiev, the Soviet situation was undoubtedly difficult, and both manpower and material resources suffered losses, but not as severe as the Germans claimed. The reporter learned from responsible sources that the Soviets have reorganized and strengthened their various army corps, so the German offensive in Crimea has not yet succeeded. The situation in Crimea is currently not a cause for concern. After the Germans occupied Poltava, the advance on Kharkov has indeed been stopped. The Three-Power Conference has had a very exciting impact on the Soviet army. The Soviet army firmly believes that as long as Britain and the United States make great efforts, sufficient weapons will continuously arrive in the Soviet Union. However, at present, Soviet equipment is still excellent, and the equipment of the Soviet forces on the front lines is even better. The fact that the German army has more tanks is openly acknowledged, but although the Soviets have lost some raw materials, their aircraft production industry can still be maintained satisfactorily. The Soviets also admit that German infantry has more automatic weapons, but this slight advantage is not enough to give the German army a decisive advantage. Although the German army has heavily concentrated its forces in the Leningrad area to launch an offensive, the Soviet army is confident and declares that the city is not in danger of being occupied, and road and rail transportation to Leningrad will be maintained. Leningrad's important industries are inevitably isolated from the outside world but continue to produce in the face of difficulties to meet the needs of the front lines of the city. Unless the German army suddenly wins an unexpected major victory, the security of the Leningrad area and the Baltic Fleet is not a cause for concern. The German army may have a million troops in the Leningrad area, forced to fight in winter conditions, and the supply problem is becoming increasingly difficult. The German army must have greatly felt the difficulty of supplying warm clothing to its troops, so it hopes to complete at least most of the war before winter, and the hasty mobilization to rush to make winter clothing shows that its previous estimates were seriously wrong. The Soviet Union is equipped with a large amount of warm clothing, which will be issued to soldiers in early winter, and the amount is sufficient for use until now. The most significant industrial losses for the Soviets are the iron ore and steel plants in the Krivoy Rog and Dnepropetrovsk areas, but it is reported that the expansion of factories in the Ural Mountains is progressing rapidly, and large-scale British and American aid is extremely important before the expansion is completed. In short, although there may still be major setbacks before winter, the situation in the Leningrad area and the southern sector is indeed more promising than before.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 7th – There was fierce fighting north of the Sea of Azov. The German army penetrated deep into the Soviet defenses and captured the staff officers of the Soviet 9th Corps. Budyonny reassembled his troops and repelled the German forces attacking Kharkov.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 7th – According to Soviet war reports, Marshal Budyonny (German news previously claimed that Budyonny's army had been completely annihilated east of Kiev) has regrouped his Ukrainian and Crimean forces and is engaging in breaking the powerful German offensive towards Kharkov. The communiqué stated that Soviet forces are counterattacking along the front and heavily damaging the advancing German forces. The Soviet High Command stated that in the past 24 hours, the German army lost 54 tanks, 30 aircraft, 90 trucks, and a large amount of military supplies. The High Command also disclosed that the German army is now receiving reinforcements and launching a more powerful attack in the Leningrad area, but all have been repelled by the Soviet defenders in Leningrad. In some locations, the German army has even been forced to retreat two or three miles. TASS reported that Soviet guerrillas are now active behind the German lines in the Leningrad area and are providing great assistance to the Soviet regular army.</p>
<h3 id="e18">British-German Prisoner Exchange Plan Still Not Agreed Upon; British Hospital Ship Did Not Sail as Scheduled <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The British-German plan to exchange sick and wounded prisoners of war has encountered further obstacles, so the British hospital ships Dina and St. Julian were unable to sail to Dieppe (northern France) this morning as scheduled. According to an announcement by the British Army, "In view of the German radio broadcast tonight (Monday) regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war, the hospital ship will not sail." This is because the German broadcast said, "One hundred prisoners will exchange for one hundred prisoners, roughly speaking, an eye for an eye." British crew members had sailed the two hospital ships to the outer harbor last night in preparation for sailing away this morning. Upon receiving the Army Department's order to cancel the voyage, they sailed the two ships back into the harbor. According to broadcasts from the Bremen and Luxembourg radio stations, the German government is only considering exchanging a portion of the prisoners and is preparing to exchange 100 British prisoners for the same number of German soldiers. Diplomatic negotiations on expanding the continued exchange of prisoners are still in progress. Before the Army Department issued this order, the British and German governments exchanged radio messages through the Calais radio station and the British Broadcasting Corporation. The British side completed all arrangements and hoped that the two hospitals would return the first batch of sick and wounded British prisoners and other British people eligible for repatriation by noon on Sunday. Unexpectedly, just before departure, they encountered another setback.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The British government has condemned Germany for violating good faith in the matter of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war and has recently canceled the departure of two hospital ships currently docked in Newhaven and ordered the prisoners who had boarded the ships to be sent back to the detention camps. All German prisoners began disembarking at 1:30 PM. It is reported that the British government received a telegram from the U.S. government yesterday morning stating that Germany is only prepared to agree to a limited exchange of tendered numbers, which is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention signed by Germany in July 1939. When War Secretary Margesson announced this matter in the House of Commons today, he said that the British government is not prepared to take risks and be deceived by Germany's breach of faith.</p>

<h3 id="e22">British and American Timely Aid, War Materials Continuously Shipped to the Soviet Union, Transportation Line Through Iran Overcomes Difficulties, Archbishop of Canterbury Views British-Soviet Alliance as an Honor <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – According to Soviet broadcasts, ships loaded with British and American tanks and aircraft have now arrived at Soviet ports.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – After the outbreak of the European war, the Soviet Union's trade with Germany was closely monitored by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. After Germany launched its war against the Soviet Union, the Ministry immediately sent an economic mission to Moscow, so it was able to estimate the Soviet Union's real need for raw materials and plan how to aid the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time. Now, Stalin's expression of gratitude for the abundant supplies that have arrived in the Soviet Union shows that Britain has already provided some assistance at a time when some people are accusing Britain of not providing much assistance to the Soviet Union. If the figures for this assistance were to be announced now, the world would see how Britain has strived to aid the Soviet Union while having to plan for its own domestic and foreign needs for land, sea, and air forces. Items that have already been shipped to the Soviet Union include rubber and tin, and in the future, they will be supplied continuously as far as transportation is possible, until the Soviet Union's needs are met. The Soviet Union's transportation methods are very effective, so the concerns of Londoners that goods arriving at Soviet ports will be congested and unable to be shipped out in time have been dispelled. The development of convenient transportation through Iran is sure to greatly assist in supplying the needs of the Soviet Union, and the direct contact between British and American representatives Beaverbrook and Harriman with Stalin is particularly meaningful for aiding the Soviet Union. This is a good sign for the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The Archbishop of Canterbury spoke at a church assembly, asking for donations to be raised for the Soviet Union, saying that Britain is honored to have the Soviet Union as its new ally. When we look back on the past, we truly see this as a strange alliance. There are still some people whose conscience is troubled every time they think of this alliance, because we cannot forget all the cruel killings and oppression during the Russian Revolution. However, in recent years, there have been signs that the spirit of some Soviet administrators has changed, and they have admitted and corrected some of their mistakes. In view of the serious problems we face today, we must not only think of the past and ignore the present and future. We know that the fighting soldiers and civilians of the Soviet Union urgently need medicine, which is sure to be one of the essentials. The British Red Cross and the St. John War Organization are now undertaking the task of striving to meet this need and have issued an appeal to raise £250,000. I hereby ask all citizens to contribute generously, no matter how much or how little, all are welcome.</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 7th – Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson said yesterday that he obtained a lot of evidence during his trip to Hawaii last year proving that Japanese residents in Hawaii and along the Pacific coast are suspected of espionage. He said, "Although most Japanese residents in Hawaii are law-abiding residents, they are willing to carry out the orders of the Japanese government." Johnson and Illinois Democratic Senator Gillette have jointly proposed a suggestion requesting the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to allocate funds to subsidize a committee dedicated to investigating pro-Axis propaganda organizations in the United States, especially Japanese organizations. It is believed that the Foreign Relations Committee will consult the State Department on this matter. It is believed that the State Department may reject this request to avoid worsening the delicate situation.</p>

<p>International News, New York, 7th – Republican leader Willkie today strongly urged the repeal of the Neutrality Act and, on behalf of the Republican Party, took the lead in proposing a stronger foreign policy. Willkie criticized the government, saying, "It is weak and useless not to lead the people in international affairs, but to follow after the people." At a banquet held by the Republican Club in honor of British Ambassador Halifax, Willkie said in a speech that the Neutrality Act is pretentious, self-deceiving, and used to comfort oneself with temporary peace.

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th – A spokesman for the Information Bureau admitted this morning while hosting foreign reporters that Japan's closure of the Polish Embassy in Tokyo is actually equivalent to recognizing Germany's annexation of Poland. He also said that the German government will probably take over Japan's Polish affairs, which is a factual matter. Japan's action was taken because it received a formal note from the German government regarding the annexation of Polish territory. When asked whether Japan would also close the embassies of other occupied European countries in Japan, the spokesman replied that Germany has not sent a note to Japan regarding the annexation of other territories, only occupation, which cannot be considered annexation. When asked about Iran's suspension of the diplomatic privileges enjoyed by the Japanese Embassy, the spokesman formally acknowledged for the first time that Japan had lodged a strong protest with the Iranian government, but said that the Iranian Embassy in Tokyo is still unrestricted, but Japan may consider this point. Finally, when asked about the date of the German note on the annexation of Poland, the spokesman declined to answer. He was then asked whether Japan would recognize the Soviet Union's annexation of eastern Polish territory. The spokesman replied that the Soviet Union had not sent a note to Japan regarding this matter. He also said that Japan is not concerned about the boundaries of Polish territory as claimed by Germany.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Cotton Yarn: Price Surge Uncontrollable, Spot and Futures Hit Limit Up <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Prices Soar Over a Hundred Yuan, Straight to the 2,000 Yuan Mark; Speculators Rush to Cover Losses, Some Even Reverse to Buying; Let's See the Outcome of the Bullish Trend</p>
<p>The yarn market is rising, and the intensity of the price surge is unprecedented. This is because of strong buying pressure, coupled with continuous sales of Nanyang yarn, and factory orders exceeding supply. This forces shorts to cover their positions in a panic, and some even seem to be reversing to buying. As a result, the market becomes tight and people are gripped by fear. Moreover, the market has been fluctuating daily in recent days. The public mentality is to buy heavily when prices open low, turning speculation into reality. The manipulators in the speculative market are truly frightening. In the past, when orders poured in from Nanyang, sellers were very excited and suppressed the market. Recently, overseas telegrams cannot be forwarded and market sentiment is universally enthusiastic. Shorts are rethinking their positions and covering, causing prices to soar. On that day, there were fluctuations of more than 100 yuan. In the afternoon, the range of ups and downs expanded greatly, and the market was busy collecting margin calls and was unable to open. Some say there may be settlement issues, but the market claims it is a spot market, so there is no way to settle. How the future will change is difficult to predict. In short, the market has entered a high level, and the waves are huge. 20-count Double Horse yarn reached a high of 2,030 yuan and a low of 1,917 yuan. In the afternoon, it hit the limit up with no market. There are rumors about cotton costs, but they are all bullish sentiment. Cotton is monopolized and there is nothing to be done. The provision of US cotton with foreign exchange is not prohibited, but there are issues with the amount.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning at 1,917 yuan, but buyers rushed in and the price rose to more than 1,950 yuan in an instant. However, buyers in the market still flocked in like a tide, pushing the price straight to over 1,990 yuan. After a brief pause, the price continued to rise. Because shorts were eager to cover, they did not limit the price and bought in at market. The market turned into a frenzy and rose to the limit up of 2,030 yuan. After the market closed, it was traded at 2,025-26 yuan outside the market. According to statistics, 16,850 bales were traded in half a day. The amounts bought by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 550 Nanyang 310</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 16,000 Total 16,850</p>
<p>On the 8th, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 55 pieces to Yangon, 125 pieces to Pinang, 67 pieces to Singapore, and 30 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Another dispatch reports that 20-count Double Horse yarn is soaring, and the talk of price increases is unprecedented. Yesterday (7th), in half a day, it surged by more than 100 yuan. From the moment it opened at 1,917 yuan, it went straight to the clouds. After briefly fluctuating at 20-30 yuan, 40-50 yuan, and 60-70 yuan, and reaching 80-90 yuan, it approached 2,000 yuan, broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, reached 2,003-4 yuan, and then 2,014-17 yuan, soaring rapidly without looking back, causing a clamor, and reaching an unprecedented new record of 2,030 yuan. It finally led to the suspension of trading due to margin calls. The price of Double Horse yarn has reached a critical point. Because shorts (customers) cover their positions at any cost, the margin they continue to provide is far from enough to cover the losses. Even customers who are long and have reaped windfall profits and gradually sell small amounts, not only will they not receive their profits at settlement, but even the margin they paid may be lost. A friend of mine went short 100 pieces of 20-count Double Horse yarn last month at a price of only around 1,700 yuan. He is now losing more than 30,000 yuan. At this point, at the end of his rope, he can only ignore it, willing to sacrifice 10,000 yuan in margin to let it go. One wonders what "windfall profits" long customers can still make. The strangest thing is that during the chaotic yarn market, the buying and selling brokers, who take advantage of the situation, are the ones who benefit. When longs take profits and sell, the market price is already close to 2,000 yuan. When they ask the broker to sell at a certain peak, the broker replies "can't sell," deliberately lowering the price by five or six yuan. Conversely, they say "can't buy," deliberately raising the price by three, four, five or six yuan. If you don't see through this inside story and rashly sell or buy, you will suffer greatly. Telephone trading is popular for a while, but it is actually the easiest tool to use for tricks. (Long)</p>
<p>After a day of closure, the Gold Double Horse futures market is soaring. The intensity of the surge is rare since the market's inception. Recently, factory orders have been rushing in from various groups, and the chips have been greatly depleted due to the monopoly. Therefore, it is not easy for shorts to borrow, so there are fees. This causes the market to reach a peak and the rise to be endless. Futures yarn is rising rapidly, and new highs are emerging one after another. When the market first opened in the morning, factory orders opened low, and the futures yarn trend was still flat. October opened at a low of 1,830 yuan, and November opened at a low of 1,870 yuan. After entering the market, the spot market surged, and futures yarn surged accordingly. The buying sentiment on the surface was so strong that there were buyers but no sellers. For a while, shorts were panicked, and longs took the opportunity to fuel the flames and search for more chips. The market was full of rumors, and the price soared to the sky. The November close was already at the limit up, rising by more than 100 yuan. In the afternoon, it was still high. October and November opened and immediately hit the limit up, so trading was not active. Looking at the trend, its rising power has not yet weakened. Moreover, all exchanges have announced a limit up, and factory orders are priced even higher in the black market. Therefore, a reversal is not easy to see. As a result, both near-term and far-term contracts rose by more than 100 yuan. A list is shown below:</p>
<h3 id="e28">Cotton Yarn Boosts Momentum, Cotton Prices Soar, Up 20-30 Yuan, Foreign Exchange is Not a Problem <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation continues to rise, and people unanimously expect higher prices. Everyone believes the supply is tight and the yarn market is rising, making the price surge even more intense.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose due to speculator buying, then fell due to Southern hedging and long liquidation. As a result, the closing price was down about 10 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to speculator selling and cotton merchant hedging, then rebounded due to European exporter buying and short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose about 5 rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open lower by 1.5 rupees today.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Outport Cotton Trading: Because the cotton yarn market is rising endlessly, spot cotton is rising by 20-30 yuan at the same time. Therefore, both general factories and fellow traders have the opportunity to directly order foreign cotton. In recent days, except for a few who cannot settle foreign exchange and are temporarily watching, most factories with liquid funds in foreign banks in Shanghai are making good opportunities to directly buy foreign cotton. As for the lower selling price and the thicker profits after arriving in Shanghai, the current situation is different from the past due to the difficulties of shipping and the scarcity of supply. This is really caused by various complicated situations.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Booming, East Piece Goods Futures Hit Limit Up <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices soared yesterday, stimulated by the soaring futures of cotton yarn and cloth. Therefore, the rise in the morning was relatively moderate, but in the afternoon it became even more sharp. Holders of goods are deeply hidden and refuse to sell. As a result, white cloth and coarse cloth rose by 2 yuan, fine cloth and twill rose by 2.5 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by 2-3 yuan. Factories are opening fewer goods, and transactions are difficult for buyers to make because sellers are hoarding goods, making them scarce. More than 400 pieces were traded on this street, mostly by speculators and dyeing factories. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Nanyang dealers purchased more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and Zhejiang East dealers purchased more than 100 pieces.</p>
<p>East Cloth: The price surge is intensifying. The closing price of the leading fine cloth futures contract on the exchange for this month was 67.5 yuan, a sharp increase of 4.4 yuan per piece compared to before the customs closure. Other November to January contracts hit the limit up in the second and third sessions, but have already risen by 3.3 to 3.5 yuan. This is because of active spot sales and speculators surging in and out of the industry, creating a situation where prices only rise and never fall. The spot market lacks goods and is becoming increasingly tight. White cloth, fine cloth and fine twill have all risen by 3.5 to 4 yuan per piece. The closing price of the leading new factory order was 68.7 yuan. Serge in colored goods rose by 1.25 cents per yard. The closing price of the new tax and new order was 2.485 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market soared due to a short squeeze in the morning and absorption by large players in the afternoon, causing trading to be suspended at one point. In the afternoon, black market trading was at a premium of 2-3 yuan, showing the strong market sentiment. The company's futures contract for delivery on the Double Tenth Festival was at 157 yuan at the opening and 60.09 yuan at the close, with a high of 61.6 yuan and a low of 57 yuan. Black market trading was at 61.8 yuan. At 12 o'clock, it reached 67 yuan, and trading was suspended.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice rose in the morning and was flat at noon. In the afternoon, prices rose again. In the morning, the market continued the price surge from before the holiday, and buying interest was strong. Therefore, Xiaojiao opened at 120 yuan, up 1 yuan compared to before the holiday. The surge then flattened slightly due to a slight pullback from speculators. Xiaojiao fell back to 118-19 yuan. Yinghua Xiaojiao was as high as 145.5 yuan, and settled at 140 yuan, which was similar to before. However, in the afternoon, there were sudden positive rumors, and speculators became active again. In addition, oil speculators abandoned their positions and joined in, and the market suddenly saw a surge in buying interest and active trading. All rice prices rose in unison. Xiaojiao spot rice at bank warehouses rose from 120 yuan, gradually to 121 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 2 yuan, and 2.5 yuan. The closing price in the evening reached 123 yuan, a huge increase of 3-4 yuan compared to before the holiday. Other rice prices all followed and rose by 2-3-4 yuan. More than 30,000 bags of spot rice were traded. Yinghua had thousands of tons of broken rice, and Broken Tip was especially popular due to the movement of the Hangzhou group. The highest price opened at 98.5 yuan, and ordinary goods ranged from 97 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin new broken early japonica rice had a slight accumulation due to market closures in both regions. Qingjiao new kiln seeds have also been launched, totaling more than 20 shi, priced at 149 yuan. As for Kunshan new japonica rice, the sales were quite strong, so although arrivals were not weak, the market did not change, opening at 150 yuan and settling at 147 yuan. Nankang early broken rice was slower to sell because the guest group preferred new japonica rice, causing the price to fall by 2-3 yuan, opening at 150.05 yuan and 148 yuan. The supply and demand of new Dujian rice was similar, and was also flat, opening at 131 yuan to 130 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of glutinous rice was quite balanced. The opening price was similar to before the holiday. Hong Kong white rice still opened high from 143 yuan to 141.5 yuan. However, glutinous tea was extremely tight due to the scarcity of goods and insufficient distribution, rising by another 1-2 yuan and opening at 135-36 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Flour Speculation Booms Accordingly <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign flour market rose even more sharply. In addition to the customer groups on this street responding to the market, there was also a great deal of speculation. Those who were unsuccessful in edible oil flocked here, and the large holders of goods raised prices first, followed by speculators who expected good prices. Prices rose step by step in a lift and release. The opening price of Paotai in the morning was 36.5 yuan, then 36.95 yuan. The afternoon closed at 37 yuan to 37.4 yuan. Banana opened at 36.2 yuan, and Jinlong Xizhan opened at 34.5 yuan and closed at 34.9 yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, it closed at 35.1 yuan to 35.5 yuan. Dongzhan opened at 35.5 yuan in the morning and rose to 35.9 yuan in the afternoon, reaching 36.1 yuan, a huge increase of 1 yuan and 1.24 yuan compared to before the holiday. More than 50,000 bags were traded, 60-70% of which were traded by speculative groups. Local flour was still within 34.5 yuan before the holiday, but yesterday it also rose to 35.5 yuan. There was no market for wheat bran, and the production price of wheat was becoming more expensive and arrivals were decreasing. Yesterday, a Japanese factory bought a batch of durum wheat, and the seller was asking for 55 yuan, which may be traded. Local factories have no way to obtain it.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Finance: Gold Prices Rise Straight Up <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market suddenly underwent an astonishing transformation. Both spot and futures gold prices rose sharply. Despite all kinds of unfavorable rumors, market sentiment was remarkably strong. Spot gold was even more favored by pawnshops and groups from Tianjin and Chaozhou. Xianghe first sold and then bought, soaring sharply. Spot gold reached an unprecedented peak of 10,000 yuan, the same as on August 23, a huge increase of 550 yuan. Even futures gold, which was unclear about the exchange rate in Hong Kong, was favored by buyers. Bill brokers and gold merchants, as well as Mingfeng, bought, and the price soared from 7,610 yuan to 7,830 yuan. Finally, some sellers took profits and pulled back the rise. As a result, the market closed up 171 yuan. Trading also increased to 3,000 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Price Reaches 10,010 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot gold trading was very active, and prices continued to rise towards new peaks. From the opening in the morning, the price was already 40 yuan higher. Xianghe first bought 30 taels at 9,490 yuan from a certain pawnshop, then continued to buy 40 taels from Hesheng and 20 taels from Chengji for 9,500 yuan. Pengfeng bought 10 taels from Hesheng for 9,510 yuan, Xianghe bought 20 taels from Hesheng and 10 taels from Yongcheng for 9,500 yuan, Shihe bought 10 taels from Yongcheng for 9,510 yuan, and another 10 taels for 20 yuan. Zhongxing bought 10 taels from Hesheng for 9,510 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from Xianghe and 10 taels from Xiangxingyong for 9,530 yuan. Then, it bought another 50 taels from Xianghe, and Yongcheng sold 10 taels to a certain pawnshop for 9,535 yuan. Hengji sold 10 taels to Zhongxing, a slight drop to 9,530 yuan. Xianghe sold 80 taels to Yifeng, 20 taels each to Zhongxing and Tianyuan, and 60 taels to Xiangxingyong, all for 9,540 yuan. Then, it sold 110 taels to Shihe, 80 taels to Xiangxingyong, and 10 taels to Zhongxing for 9,535 yuan. At noon, it sold another 20 taels to Shihe, 5 taels to Jingfu and 10 taels to Hesheng, closing at 9,530 yuan. In the afternoon, Xianghe suddenly bought again, and the price was raised by 70 yuan, first buying 50 taels from Chengji for 9,600 yuan, and then buying 10 taels from Chida, which was actually for 9,900 yuan. In an instant, it raised the price by another 300 yuan. Soon, Xinyuan sold 10 taels to Gonghe for 9,820 yuan. Then, Gonghe, Chengda, Decheng and Hesheng bought, and were supplied by Chengji and Xiangxingyong. Therefore, it fluctuated around 9,840-50 yuan for a long time. Seeing that Shihe sold 10 taels to Chengda for 9,900 yuan, Fulai bought 50 taels from Dafeng for 9,930 yuan. Xianghe bought 20 taels from Xinyuan for 9,980 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from Hesheng. Mingfeng bought 60 taels from Decheng, Hesheng bought 40 taels, and Chatianyuan bought 10 taels from Deda, closing at 10,000 yuan, up 550 yuan compared to the noon close last Saturday, with a fluctuation of 510 yuan. A total of 1,200-1,300 taels were traded.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Import and Export Firms Negotiate Barter Deals <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC listing prices as flat. The small counter prices of HSBC and other banks remained relatively unchanged. The black market exchange rates for British and American currency still lacked a definite price, depending entirely on the supply and demand at the time. A certain American bank suddenly sold US dollars at 4.5 yuan, which was said to be settled by an importing firm, which was quite unexpected. Telegraphic transfers continued to see demand without supply at the above price. In the afternoon, applications for settlements for imported foreign flowers were also returned, and the market became even tighter. In the evening, the US exchange rate had softened to 4.375, but it was not certain that it could be settled, 25 tighter than the previous Saturday before the holiday. The British exchange rate was 2 shillings and 6.25 pence for large transactions, 1.875 tighter. According to reliable sources, the city's exporters and importers have established contact, and telegrams for export exchange are no longer being sent to Shanghai to offset import telegraphic transfers to the city that are not allowed to be applied for. Therefore, future foreign trade will be on a barter basis.</p>
<h3 id="e35">US Dollar at 24.2 Yuan, Unprecedented High Price <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise by 10 yuan each, and British gold notes fell back to flat after a fall. The demand for US dollar notes increased sharply, and the evening market rose to 24.2 yuan, a sharp increase of 1.4 yuan compared to before the holiday. Hong Kong notes also tended to rise, and the evening market rose to 5.5 yuan. Canadian and Philippine notes were also quite strong. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both tended to rise, the former rising to 2.44 yuan and the latter rising to 1.07 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 2,412 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were thrown out again, still priced at 245 yuan. At the same time, 2,800 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were also contracted for delivery in October, priced at 155 yuan. A wholesale amount of Tianjin refined oil is also being negotiated. However, spot oil continued to be tight because sellers were still holding on tightly. The unified market sold 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, and 150 barrels of crude oil, 500 tins of Yantai crude oil, and 30 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil. As for cottonseed oil and rapeseed oil futures, speculators were frightened after receiving warnings before the holiday, so there was no trading.</p>
<p>Corn futures trading was quite active yesterday, because speculators in edible oil suddenly favored it, leading to a lively buying sentiment. The price rose sharply by 3-5 yuan compared to before. The unified market traded more than 4,000 tons of Saigon new corn for October and November delivery. Spot sales were sluggish, with only 200 bags of Dutch white corn sold, priced similarly to before.</p>
<p>On the 8th, 410 bags of beans were exported to Singapore, and 200 bags of groundnut kernels were exported to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Public bond black market: After being closed for three days, the market opened as usual yesterday. In these three days, the situation has brewed many changes, and financial changes have been significant, such as various cotton yarns rising by more than 100 yuan and being suspended from trading, and cash rising to 10,010 yuan, yet there are still people who need it. The surge has been reflected in public bonds, causing Sichuan and Guangdong groups to come and sell, selling goods to seek wealth, and turning to hoarding goods. Therefore, public bonds fell sharply. After Class C bonds entered the two-yuan level, they almost broke through the one-yuan level again, with Class A bonds falling the most sharply by more than one yuan. Yesterday morning, Yitai, Tongshun, Renchang, Zhongyi, and Runde bought, while Zhenchang, Baolong, Hefeng, Lianyi, Hengkang, and Tongkang sold. Class C bonds opened at 1.8 yuan, Class A bonds broke the 1-yuan level, Class B bonds broke the 3-yuan level, and Class D bonds also entered the 9-yuan level. The noon close fell slightly by 4-5 jiao. In the afternoon, Baolong and No. 25 sold the most aggressively, and Runde, Tongshun, Yitai, Renchang, Runli and others bought, while Tongkang, Lianyi, Hongda, Yichang, Dazhong, and Jiufu were all sellers. Class C bonds once saw a low price of 1.1 yuan. At the close, Runde bought more than 100,000, so it recovered to 4.5 jiao. The closing market prices all fell by 5 jiao to 1.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 300 shares of the Dachunghua Match Company were traded, priced at 54.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Zhongye stock market opened with prices rising sharply. After the opening, buying sentiment was even stronger, and the shares rose in a straight line, rarely turning back, eventually closing at the highest prices. The transaction volume broke all previous records. Rubber shares closely followed the trend of industrial shares.</p>

<h3 id="e38">US Mission Arrives in Hong Kong to Strengthen China's Combat Power, China, Britain, and the United States Align Actions, If War Breaks Out, Aerial Warfare Will Decide Victory, Chinese Military Experts Form Liaison Group to Discuss Strategies <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Following the conclusion of the Anglo-American conference in Manila, Philippines, the US military mission led by General Magruder arrived in Hong Kong by plane. It is widely believed that the United States has gradually implemented aid to China in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, to help China, which is standing on the Pacific outpost, fight for the overall situation.</p>
<p>Chinese Military Experts Form Liaison Group</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reported yesterday in an editorial on the arrival of the US military mission to China, stating that Major General Magruder, head of the US military mission initially decided to be sent to China, participated in the Anglo-American military conference in Manila and then traveled to Hong Kong with five senior US Army officers. Their current plans are unknown, but it is heard that the Chongqing government is eager for the mission to go to the capital and has sent Chinese military experts trained in the United States to form a liaison group to cooperate with the mission.</p>
<p>The Aims of the Three Countries Are Completely Consistent</p>
<p>The United States' sending a military mission to China is actually another step in the military cooperation among China, the United States, and Britain to defeat Japan. The Anglo-American military conference in Manila last Saturday was also an action moving in the same direction. Its aim, as stated by Tokyo newspapers, is to force Japan to refrain from taking action and strengthen the anti-Japanese encirclement. The aim of the Manila conference and the military mission to China is to prevent Japan's plots. There is no need to hide the fact that the Japanese side has also correctly and accurately interpreted it this way. Plans to take military action against Japan must have been formulated. Whether we implement them will depend on Japan's actions in the near future.</p>
<p>Air Power Will Determine Victory</p>
<p>The fact that Major General Magruder and his party flew to Hong Kong in a US Navy bomber is of great significance. If Japan goes to war with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, air power will determine the outcome of the war. Air power is weaker than the presumed enemy. According to some experts, Japan has inadvertently neglected to develop its air force to the standards of Western air forces, putting Japan in a weak strategic position.</p>
<p>The Final Battle Is Gradually Unfolding</p>
<p>All parties welcome the arrival of the US military mission to China, as it marks the beginning of the final fighting stage of China's war against Japan. Chinese government leaders are extremely willing to provide the maximum cooperation to all military suggestions made by US and British experts within the scope possible. At a time when Nazi aggression in Europe has not yet achieved its aims, the Chinese people will be greatly encouraged by the fact that the Axis powers in the Far East will also encounter the same failure.</p>
<p>Mr. Grady Arrives in Shanghai Briefly</p>
<p>US Assistant Secretary of State Grady visited Chongqing on the evening of the 6th and returned to Hong Kong to attend the trilateral conference held in Hong Kong to discuss the current financial problems of the Chongqing government and how to provide more effective assistance. Before coming to the Far East, Grady revealed in Manila that he planned to visit Shanghai after visiting Chongqing as a destination in his original itinerary. US officials here were naturally eager for Grady to visit Shanghai, but yesterday the US Consulate General reported that Grady would not be coming to Shanghai. No telegram has been received from US Consul General Smith in Hong Kong. However, as Grady urgently needs to return home, it is widely believed that he must know about the financial situation in Shanghai and the interests of the American community upon arrival in Hong Kong, and that his trip to Shanghai can be cancelled.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Chongqing's Compared-Term Deposits: Enthusiastic Depositors, Banks Establishing Deposit Methods, Attractive Interest Rates with High Premiums <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>To guide Shanghai's floating capital inland, various commercial banks, led by banks from the Sichuan community, have launched Chongqing compared-term deposits. Depositors are very enthusiastic. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency obtained the following detailed information from Sichuan Meifeng, He Cheng, and other banks yesterday: (1)</p>
<p>Amount</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on the size of the deposit amount, but the minimum amount per account must be 1,000 national currency units. (2) Term: This deposit is a half-month fixed-term deposit, with the middle and end of each month as the deposit and withdrawal dates. If depositors wish to deposit before the term, they can do so with the bank's consent. However, interest will still accrue from the middle or end of the month to facilitate Chongqing's deposits and withdrawals. If depositors wish to withdraw part or all of their deposit before the term, they can do so with the bank's consent. However, interest for that term will not be paid. (3)</p>
<p>Interest Rate</p>
<p>The interest rate for this deposit fluctuates each term, based on the interest rate in Chongqing. The bank sets the rate once every half month. (The interest rate for the previous term this year was around 2% per month.) (4) Deposit: This deposit is calculated in Chongqing's general-use national currency. Deposits in Shanghai are converted based on the exchange rate between Shanghai and Chongqing on that day. (For example, if the Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate yesterday was 880 yuan deposited in Shanghai to withdraw 1,000 yuan in Chongqing.) (5) Withdrawal: If depositors wish to withdraw part or all of the principal and interest on the due date (please notify us three days in advance for large amounts), the bank can convert it to Shanghai currency at the Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate on that day. Also, if depositors wish to withdraw funds in Chongqing or other cities outside Chongqing, the bank will issue a draft without additional fees. However, telegraphic transfers will incur additional telegraph fees. If there is a remittance fee from Chongqing to the withdrawal location, that fee must also be paid separately. (6)</p>
<p>Renewal</p>
<p>When the deposit matures, if the depositor does not come to withdraw it, the bank will automatically renew it and compound interest. Depositors can come to the bank at any time to complete the renewal procedures, without being restricted to a specific time. (7) Deposit Certificate: The bank will issue a deposit certificate as proof of this deposit. The numbers on the deposit certificate are all in Chongqing's general-use national currency. The interest rate for each term and subsequent renewals, as well as withdrawals and other items, will be recorded on the back of the deposit certificate. Please pay attention to checking whether the registered amounts are correct. (8) Supplementary Provisions: The bank may revise the various methods in this chapter and section at any time in accordance with market conditions, without further notice.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great Evening Post" reports that sugar prices in the city rose again today (the 7th). Sugar merchants are continuing to ship stored sugar to Tianjin, where sugar prices must be extremely high. It is said that yesterday (the 6th), 12,000 bags of Shanghai sugar were loaded onto ships bound for Tianjin, and another 3,000 bags are scheduled to be loaded onto the Fusheng ship bound for Tianjin on the 8th. In the past week, Shanghai merchants have shipped a total of 35,468 bags of sugar, including 30,900 bags from Singapore and the rest from Hong Kong. The supply is quite abundant, but prices continue to rise, with each bag rising another two to four yuan this morning. The main reason is the large number of speculators and the transfer of sugar to Tianjin, which is also related to the soaring sugar prices. Today, the retail price of salt has also increased by one jiao per small bag.</p>

<p>According to news yesterday, the National Children's Welfare Association of China will launch a fundraising campaign on the Double Tenth Festival to raise one million yuan to aid refugee children. According to Mr. Ding, the secretary of the association, the association is currently preparing for everything. However, because hundreds of foreigners, who previously donated to charitable causes every year, have already returned to their countries, this fundraising campaign will be very difficult.</p>
<p>10,000 Fundraising Letters to be Sent</p>
<p>The association will print 10,000 letters in Chinese, half of which will be sent to past donors to the association, and the other half to relatives and friends introduced by them. In addition, 500 letters in English will be printed and sent to foreigners in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about charity. Those who donate 100 yuan will be given a silver medal by the association, and those who donate 1,000 yuan will be given a glass mirror frame. All Chinese letters issued will be signed by all members of the association's finance committee, while the English letters will be signed by Bishop Ward and six others, including Alerman.</p>
<p>More Than 500 Refugee Children to Benefit</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will last for three weeks and has been decided by the executive committee of the association at a meeting held at the YMCA. The funds raised will be used to continue maintaining the three refugee shelters run by the association. These refugee shelters house a total of 400 refugee children, 140 homeless orphans, and 40 infants. Due to rising prices, the estimated annual cost of these shelters is approximately 350,000 yuan. The association hopes that enthusiastic members of society will donate generously.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Prospects of Shanghai's Automobile Industry in the Eyes of Automobile Managers: Gasoline Rationing Does Not Affect Business; Number of Chinese Car Buyers Increases Daily; Cars in Stock Sold Out <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>According to leaders in the automobile industry, although car owners in Shanghai are subject to gasoline restrictions, car dealers in Shanghai who manage products from British and American factories remain optimistic about the future of the automobile industry in Shanghai. Once a large amount of gasoline arrives in Shanghai at the end of this month, the difficulties encountered by the automobile industry can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Optimism About Gasoline Situation</p>
<p>Employees of the leading automobile company in Shanghai unanimously believe that the current gasoline situation is not a cause for concern. Shanghai's entire gasoline business depends entirely on the attitude of the British and American governments towards the production of 1942 model cars by various factories. Most of the larger car dealers in Shanghai also stated that because there are currently no cars for sale, they are not affected by gasoline restrictions. However, it is pointed out that if the gasoline situation continues to deteriorate next year, even if 1942 model cars are shipped to Shanghai, car dealers in Shanghai will inevitably encounter difficulties. When this issue was raised with employees of various car dealerships, most expressed optimism, stating that the gasoline supply situation will gradually improve and return to normal.</p>
<p>New Cars for Next Year Being Reserved One After Another</p>
<p>Given the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai in buying cars in the past three years, when new cars arrive in Shanghai next year, they will definitely continue to be purchased. It is also learned that most of the major car dealers in Shanghai have already reserved cars from British and American factories. However, the British and American governments have restricted the production of cars, so it is still questionable whether these cars will be allowed to be imported into Shanghai. According to merchants engaged in the automobile industry in Shanghai, Shanghai has always been the center of automobile trading in China. It is difficult to believe that cars will not be allowed to be imported into China in the future. At the same time, it is said that the automobile industry in Shanghai may be extremely developed next year. Many customers have already reserved 1942 model cars. It is heard that when new customers buy cars today, they are immediately introduced to gasoline companies in Shanghai in order to purchase the gasoline they need. The gasoline merchant will inform them of the amount of gasoline allocated, and the buyer will probably have no objection. It is said that anyone who buys a car from a major car company in Shanghai must also register with the gasoline company at the same time.</p>
<p>Restriction on Imports May Not Be True</p>
<p>Although I felt that people generally expressed optimism when investigating this issue, car dealers still had some concerns. Some importers replied to reporters' questions, saying that there are bound to be various difficulties in terms of import and export, and the British and American governments may restrict the automobile industry. However, it has been repeatedly pointed out that Shanghai's gasoline rationing system has little to do with the future of the automobile business in the city. Even if the current restrictions continue to exist, car dealers have nothing to worry about. However, if the source of gasoline is completely cut off, the automobile market in Shanghai will naturally come to a complete standstill. However, we should know that other oil-using industries will be affected in the same way, and the British and American governments may not want to create such a situation.</p>
<p>Amazing Performance of American Production</p>
<p>Curtis, the general manager of Buick Motor Company of General Motors, recently declared that Buick and other cars will continue to be shipped to Shanghai in 1942. This is one of the reasons why car dealers in Shanghai are optimistic about the future. All major automobile companies in the United States, except for Ford, have stopped producing 1941 model cars. It is heard that Ford will continue to produce until the end of this month according to the original plan. However, this only affects the production volume of American cars in 1941. American magazines report that although the gasoline issue is unpredictable, the American gasoline industry continues to show amazing performance. This alone is enough to show that the United States is optimistic about the production and sales of automobiles and gasoline at home and abroad in 1942.</p>
<p>Automobile Needs Increasing, Not Decreasing</p>
<p>A car dealer said that although most automobile factories in the United States are engaged in wartime production, there is still hope for the development of the American automobile industry in 1942. This is another reason why car dealers in Shanghai are optimistic about the automobile industry next year. In the past three years, Shanghai has been the center of automobile sales. Since the cessation of the Shanghai War, the need for heavy trucks and private cars has greatly increased, and the demand for private cars has increased with the increase in people who have become rich during the war. Managers of various types of cars in Shanghai expect that the demand for cars in 1942 will increase rather than decrease.</p>
<p>Promotion Plans Already Formulated</p>
<p>It is said that various types of cars shipped to Shanghai have almost been sold out, and there are many Chinese buyers. The automobile industry in Shanghai often occupies an important position in the city's commerce. The sale of gasoline by the British and American Oil Company's China office mainly relies on private car owners, and Shanghai has the largest demand for gasoline. If Shanghai's automobile industry is hit by the British and American governments' restrictions on foreign factories, the gasoline company will inevitably suffer a major blow. Currently, the major automobile companies in Shanghai have formulated automobile promotion plans for 1942, but the details are not yet known.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that in the case of Te Taipang being accused of concealing the truth, the U.S. Court in China specially appointed Lou Deng. Today (the 7th), it has ruled on the request made by the defendant's lawyer, Wilderding, to dismiss the first charge.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyer Seeks Acquittal</p>
<p>Mr. Wei stated in court that each charge in the complaint must be independent. He also stated that when the defendant, Te Taipang, filled out the certification card, his intention was never to use it as the basis for applying for bailiff. In fact, he only reported to the FBI in Washington that someone was already in custody. The defendant's lawyer also stated that Te Taipang's omission of the scar item on the certification card was an unintentional negligence. Perhaps Te Taipang did not want to fill in all the scars on his legs on the certification card as a personal advertisement. Te Taipang's appointment as deputy bailiff was due to the recommendation of the former bailiff, Li Quesheng, and approved by the judge of the U.S. Court in China. We cannot prosecute him for a criminal offense simply because he omitted one line on the certification card. The defendant's lawyer continued, "It doesn't matter much to me if the first charge is dismissed. However, we should not kick a man when he is down."</p>
<p>Prosecutor Decides to Present Evidence</p>
<p>Prosecutor Shields stated that each charge listed in the complaint is a crime. According to legal regulations, the maximum penalty for the crime is imprisonment for ten years or a fine of 10,000 yuan, or both. The prosecutor continued to tell the court that he intended to present evidence to prove that the defendant was unemployed in December 1940. At that time, there were two friends, one of whom was this bailiff, Li Quesheng, and the other was a non-American whose name was unknown. At that time, Li Quesheng told the defendant that Bailiff Peterson would resign soon, and the defendant could replace him. After receiving this news, Te Taipang contacted another friend, saying that if he could take office as bailiff, he could get a salary of 1,800 U.S. dollars per year, plus a housing subsidy of 62 U.S. dollars, so he asked a friend to find three sets of fingerprints and three photos.</p>
<p>Case Involves Mr. Li Quesheng</p>
<p>The prosecutor continued, "If I present this evidence to the court, it will show that the U.S. Court bailiff intended to make Te Taipang the deputy bailiff without sending the fingerprints to Washington." Later, Washington telegraphed the bailiff's office, explaining that they had not yet received the fingerprints of the person to be appointed regarding the appointment of the deputy bailiff. After that, Te Taipang sent another set of fingerprints to Washington. At the same time, the bailiff wrote to Washington, requesting the speedy appointment of Te Taipang as deputy bailiff. The prosecutor then stated that the evidence he intended to present would establish a preliminary evidence against the defendant. The case will continue to be heard in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, before dawn, Japanese sentries stationed near the Xiaoshadu Wharf on the Suzhou River saw a sampan boat passing by and fired at it without asking any questions, firing more than ten shots. Stray bullets flew into the concession area, but fortunately, it was late at night and no one was injured. It is said that the reason why the Japanese soldiers fired was that there were too many passengers on the boat, which violated the regulations. Another theory is that the boat was carrying goods intended to be transported to the occupied area, so the Japanese soldiers fired to stop it from sailing. It is not known whether anyone was injured in the sampan boat, but it is known that all passengers and boatmen were arrested by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Wang Hanqing, manager of the Tongchangxiang Copper and Tin Shop on Xinza Road in the Public Concession, was suddenly shot and killed by someone around 6:30 PM yesterday evening, hitting his right waist. The murderer fled. Details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>One Bullet Fatal</p>
<p>Tongchangxiang Copper and Tin Shop at No. 150 Xinza Road, at the intersection of Wenzhou Road, is a single-story shop that has been open for many years. The shop's shareholder and manager, Wang Hanqing, was 50 years old and from Nanjing. At around 6:30 PM yesterday, Wang was browsing the evening newspaper next to the counter at the door when a thug suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at him without any reason, hitting Wang's right waist and piercing through his left rib. The bullet also shot into the wall, forming a small hole. After being wounded, Wang shouted loudly that it was not good, and immediately fell to the ground and died. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, hurriedly fled west with his weapon and disappeared.</p>
<p>Alone in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the incident, other shopkeepers reported it to the Xinza Road Police Station, which ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. However, the murderer had already disappeared. Wang was covered in blood and had died. A ambulance was called to transport the body to Baolong Hospital. One bullet casing was recovered, and it was determined to be a revolver bullet. It is heard that Wang was alone in Shanghai, and his family lived in his hometown of Nanjing. He only had one son, named Songnian, who was 23 years old and lived at home as a farmer.</p>
<p>Mourning in the Industry</p>
<p>According to the shop's staff, Wang was amiable, and when there were disputes in the industry, he would always step forward to mediate and make peace. Making peace was Wang's motto. Now that he has been tragically shot, it is truly unfathomable. When the reporter arrived at the scene to investigate, generally those who heard the news from the industry were nearly full of the room, sighing and lamenting endlessly. According to witnesses, the murderer was a short man wearing a black short coat, barefoot and wearing shoes, looking like a coolie. After firing the shot, he fled west on Xinza Road. The police are currently investigating.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) There were previously three Hong Kong overseas Chinese education groups: the Hong Kong branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association, the Kowloon Education Association, and the Kowloon Teachers' Union. The current authorities, to achieve unification, are organizing the Hong Kong branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association to unify these groups. This association is affiliated with the Overseas Chinese Education Federation (located in Chongqing) and has designated the first board of directors and supervisors. A preliminary meeting was held at the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Middle School, attended by approximately one hundred directors and supervisors. Zheng Hongnian was publicly elected as interim chairman, and discussions began. Attendees expressed disagreement with the procedures for the formation of the board, leading to lively debate. After three hours of intense discussion, a provisional agreement was reached at 7:00 PM to hold an inauguration ceremony for the board on Double Tenth Day. Regarding the issue of the board's formation procedures, it was decided that two months after the directors and supervisors of the two associations swore their oaths of office, a re-election would be held. A specialist stationed in Hong Kong by our Ministry of Education reported on the preparatory progress as follows: 1. After the formation of this association, a Hong Kong branch will be established under the Overseas Chinese Education Federation. All directors and staff of this association will consist of the directors, supervisors, and staff of the original groups, plus the addition of university presidents and education scholars. 2. The Overseas Chinese Education Federation has stipulated ten work plans for the 30th year, which overseas branches should implement: (1) Investigate the conditions of local overseas Chinese schools; (2) Study matters related to the promotion and reform of local overseas Chinese education; (3) Promote vocational teacher education and civil education; (4) Assist overseas Chinese students in returning to China for further education; (5) Establish overseas library supply agencies; (6) Organize achievement exhibitions; (7) Organize sports meets and health competitions; (8) Guide and assist members in pursuing further studies; (9) Assist members in improving their lives and resolving employment issues; (10) Handle matters entrusted by the government. The work plan for the 30th year of this association should be drafted by the board of directors based on the federation's regulations. However, here is one suggestion for everyone: this year's work should focus on (1) implementing health education; (2) discussing school administration; (3) holding moral education conferences; (4) promoting safety activities; (5) addressing issues of school flags, badges, and uniforms; (6) investigating unregistered private schools; (7) promoting phonetic Mandarin; (8) establishing people's schools and charity schools; (9) promoting rent reduction campaigns; (10) researching school fee reductions; (11) discouraging formalistic education; (12) organizing evening continuing education classes for teachers; (13) assisting the government in detecting counterfeit diplomas and academic records; (14) rectifying school name campaigns. The outline will be drafted by the board of directors and discussed at the next meeting.</p>

Han Yu said, "Recorders must extract the essentials, and compilers must grasp the main arguments." Extracting the essentials and grasping the main arguments are also the so-called "outline style" of notes. When creating an outline, pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>1. Briefly browse the entire book, paying attention to the key points of each section.</p>
<p>2. During this brief reading, you must select the main topics to use for the outline of the work.</p>
<p>3. Write down the key points of the first section, and then carefully read the text from which these key points are derived, briefly noting one or two sentences of explanation.</p>
<p>4. Repeat the above method, filling in the other sections in the outline.</p>
<p>5. The so-called outline is only a guide to the material we have just read. It is not necessary to narrate; simply state the essential points and key explanations.</p>
<p>6. When the outline is completed, compare it with the original text to see if it is accurate.</p>
<p>(3) Critical Style: If we read carefully, we will inevitably gain insights. Once we have insights, we should immediately record them. By gradually accumulating these insights, we will surely have points of agreement and disagreement, or what we consider to be right and wrong. We must have reasons for our agreement, disagreement, rightness, and wrongness. Noting these reasons is the critical style of reading notes. Furthermore, if we feel that there are points that can be supplemented in a book, we can record them in our notes, which is also the critical style of reading notes. Do not make groundless criticisms or use opinions arbitrarily. It is not acceptable to be foolish and self-righteous.</p>
<p>(4) Explanatory Style: When reading, if we encounter words or sentences that we cannot understand, we should note them down so that we can ask teachers and friends for clarification or consult other books. After receiving clarification from teachers and friends or obtaining information from other books, we should annotate them in our notes. Although this type of note may seem inferior to the previous three, this hands-on approach is still very beneficial. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Establishing the Eternal Life of Life <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Hirano</p>
<p>Luo Jialing, the wife of Hardoon, died. As a wealthy woman, she quietly passed away, leaving behind what people cherish, giving people what kind of feelings, and what kind of questions are people focusing on after her death?</p>
<p>Ms. Pearl S. Buck said in her "My Faith": Positive force is life, negative force is death. So-called life means dynamic, forward-moving, containing vitality, automatically growing, or being promoted by everything it touches to grow, and giving positive reactions to external stimuli. So-called death means static, evasive, non-automatically growing, and giving negative reactions to external stimuli.</p>
<p>Mozi said: In ancient times, the death of the benevolent was rest, and the death of the unrighteous was hiding.</p>
<p>We don't need to pursue the feelings associated with the death of Luo Jialing. As for the questions after her death, some people naturally care about them, and some people don't care about them.</p>
<p>Einstein said: "Conscious people often feel that life is a kind of adventure, but life must be rescued from death." In today's Shanghai society, many people are pursuing "wealth that can be sought, even if it is holding the whip, I will do it," but feel "if it cannot be sought, follow what I like," I am afraid there are still very few. It is hoped that those who are pursuing it will recite Einstein's words, go out of death and into life, and establish the eternal life of each individual's life.</p>
<h3 id="e77">How to Promote the Used Book Movement <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wenhu</p>
<p>Adopting a Circular Transmission System</p>
<p>Children's tuition is indeed a major burden for parents, but the cost of books is no small burden either. It is even more difficult for poor students to support themselves. Even if tuition is paid by scholarships, grants, and free places, guaranteeing admission, the books still need to be purchased. It is impossible to enter school without books to read. Therefore, poor students cannot help but hesitate in front of used book stalls, touching their pockets, their hearts willing but their pockets not capable enough, which is really pitiful!</p>
<p>The fact is that the soaring price of books not only increases the burden on parents and threatens the dropout of poor students, but also affects university professors and primary school teachers. This is indeed an urgent problem that needs to be solved by the cultural circle. I am making an appeal here for students in difficulty, hoping that all sectors of society will help.</p>
<p>Right now is the time when the used book movement is surging, and many enthusiastic people in society are planning various methods to promote this movement. For example: exchanging used books - although this is a good method; but this batch of books is limited to more advanced or specialized subjects. It can be promoted in middle schools and universities, but may not be effective below middle school, because textbooks below middle school are, in fact, unsystematic, with different schools using books published by different bookstores. In this way, exchanging books is not easy to "match up."</p>
<p>In addition, some people borrow books from libraries to temporarily solve the problem of textbooks.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the fundamental solution is to implement the so-called "circular transmission system." There are two ways to promote this system: one is to be undertaken by the students, and the other is broad-based, and is jointly assisted by students, schools and people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>In the first method, the school purchases a large number of books and distributes them to each student, and each student returns them to the school at the end of the semester. When school starts in the next semester, the school authorities can distribute them to each student again. Round and round, adding new and replacing old. Can it not last for several semesters? The cost of maintaining the addition of new books and replacing old books only requires a very small amount instead of constantly buying new books. Middle schools and universities can all do this. In this way, from the first semester of the first academic year to graduation from university, the total cost of books is very small. Otherwise, even thousands of yuan will not be enough.</p>
<p>The second method is a more effective method, which is initiated by graduating students to donate part or all of the books they have read, or books other than textbooks, as a memorial to their alma mater (they can still borrow them from the school by mail or in person when they need them in the future). Another meaning is to "gather strength from all" and "benefit future students." The school should give donors appropriate rewards. This move can also resonate with students, teachers, and even alumni who have been away from school for a long time, and can also get the help of people who are generally enthusiastic about education in society. While students in school only sacrifice old books they have read for one semester or one academic year, they can enjoy unlimited convenience.</p>
<p>Now I hope that these two methods can be carried out at the same time, so that we can get results quickly. This system should be adopted by primary schools as soon as possible, so that students can develop the habit from an early age. So that they can directly know how to cherish public property, have a sense of responsibility, and have a sense of mutual assistance; indirectly they can cultivate compassion - these are the foundations of being a human being. This will not only enhance the connection between students and schools, but also allow schools to take this opportunity to enrich their libraries. Therefore, what students will shout in the future, "The school is me, I am the school," is not empty talk.</p>
<p>In short, in the current era, producers should certainly try their best to save; consumers should be even more frugal, saving material and financial resources to be worthy of our country.</p>

<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>6.  Bao Longtu</p>
<p>Speaking of Bao Longtu, to this day, there is still no one who does not know of him. The power of novels and dramas is truly great. During the Song Dynasty, the official position of Academician of the Hall of the Imperial Palace was established. The Halls included the Guanwen Hall and the Chongzheng Hall, etc. The Pavilions included the Longtu Pavilion, the Tianzhang Pavilion, and the Baowen Pavilion, etc., eleven pavilions in all, each with Academicians, Associate Academicians, and Awaiting-Command officials. Bao Zheng once served as an Associate Academician of the Longtu Pavilion, so later generations all knew of Bao Longtu, and some even used Longtu as his name. However, during the Song Dynasty, even children and women knew of Bao Daizhi, because Bao Zheng had served as Awaiting-Command of the Tianzhang Pavilion, and concurrently knew of the Censorate. He frequently criticized powerful and favored ministers, so his reputation for integrity shook the world, and women and children all knew of him, so he was called Bao Daizhi. Later, he was promoted to Associate Academician of the Longtu Pavilion. Afterwards, due to the death of his son, he requested a convenient prefecture. He was then appointed to administer Yangzhou, as Bao Zheng was a native of Hefei in Luzhou, so Yangzhou was convenient for him. He was then transferred to Luzhou and Chizhou, and then summoned from Jiangning Prefecture to serve as Acting Prefect of Kaifeng Prefecture. The Prefect of Kaifeng Prefecture, during the Song Dynasty, was the most respected of the officials who were close to the people. During the reign of Emperor Taizu of Song, he appointed Emperor Taizong as the Prefect of Kaifeng Prefecture, thus its position was very noble. Bao Zheng was stern and resolute, unafraid of power, and able to eliminate harm for the people. Relatives of the nobility and powerful eunuchs all restrained themselves when they saw him, and no one did not fear his name. Therefore, at that time, people said, "Bao Zheng smiling is rarer than the Yellow River running clear," which extremely emphasized how difficult it was to see him smile. One can imagine his iron-faced countenance, his spirit of not tolerating any leniency. Therefore, the capital (i.e., Kaifeng) had a saying: "If connections don't work, there's Yama Bao." Because the common people considered Yama, King of Hell, to be the most unafraid of power. Whether one was a bloodthirsty demon king, a wealthy and honored emperor enjoying worldly pleasures, a cunning and wealthy merchant scheming against others day and night, or someone who harms others for their own benefit, contends for power, or beggars, starving people, or oppressed laborers, in the human world the strong bullying the weak and the violent oppressing the few, only Yama treats everyone equally. Once the summons for one's soul is issued, no amount of human effort, wealth, power, martial force, seductive women, or evil influence can be used to collude or evade it. As the saying goes, "Yama decrees death at the third watch, and will not let anyone live until the fifth watch." Only then did they use Yama to compare Bao Zheng's strictness and impartiality, and some even considered Bao Zheng to be Yama, which is truly laughable. Furthermore, some even claimed that Yama still protects his subordinates who manipulate power and commit corruption, causing the unjust death of the innocent, and created a play called "Bao Longtu Judges the Officials," to show that Bao Longtu was even more just and upright than Yama. All of this is later generations using it to satirize the world and ridicule customs, and should not be regarded as actually having happened.</p>

<p>13.  Wandering to Shanghai</p>
<p>"Second Brother, Meibao will definitely repay your kindness in the future!" He crossed his hands in front of his chest, originally intending to bow to Yukun, but then he thought that they shouldn't be too distant as people who know each other well. Perhaps if he bowed, Yukun would be unhappy, so he quickly stopped himself.</p>
<p>Yukun threw one of the braised tails in his hand at Begonia's head like a dart. With a "whoosh" sound, it landed right in the spittoon.</p>
<p>"There's no need to say such things!" He pulled up the sleeve of the ramie short jacket he was wearing and wiped his face with it for a while. "You father and daughter are finally reunited, and I'm tired of staying here too. Zhang Laoliu, pack up my few ragged clothes, and we'll see each other again in winter!"</p>
<p>Although Begonia, Meibao, and the two brothers Xiaogouzi didn't want him to leave in such a hurry, Yukun was a natural oddball. He would leave when he said he would leave, and stay when he said he would stay, and no one could keep him.</p>
<p>"These pleasantries are also unnecessary!" He not only refused their attempts to keep him, but also insisted that no one see him off when he left the village. "I just hope you live peacefully here, and I can come anytime. Who wants you to line up to see me off like in the opera 'The Linked Rings'?"</p>
<p>Begonia's family had no choice but to smile and see him out the door, staring blankly at his short figure slowly disappearing in the pale yellow light of the setting sun. (231)</p>

<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been quite a few literary novels adapted for the stage and filmed, but few are as magnificent as "The Family." The proper allocation of roles and the strength of the cast make it unprecedented in the history of Chinese cinema. We express our great excitement for this unprecedented and historic achievement in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>As for the lead roles: Jiang Ming's portrayal of Old Master Gao, Wang Yuanlong's of Gao Kewen, Li Ming's of Gao Keming, Mei Xi's of Juexin, Liu Qiong's of Juemin, and Gu Yelu's of Zhang Huiru all fit the ideal. However, Wang Yin's Juehui seems too "old" in age, although his personality matches the role. As for the supporting roles, they excite us. Hong Jingling's Ke'an and Wang Xianzai's Keding are impeccable. As for the female roles: Hu Die's Shuyun, Chen Yunshang's Zhang Yunhua, Yuan Meiyun's Qian Mei, Chen Yanyan's Mingfeng, Gu Lanjun's Li Ruijue, Zhang Wan's Aunt Chen, Li Hong's Shuhua, and Chen Juanjuan's Shuzhen, etc., are all cast according to their individual personalities and acting skills. Others such as Xu Xinyuan's Commander Zhang, Han Langen's Young Master Zhang, Yin Xiucen's Feng Leshan, Yuan Zhuru's Zhou, Tong Yuejuan's Wan'er, and Gu Meijun's Xier, etc., also satisfy us. Although strictly speaking, this cast is not the most outstanding, it generally meets our ideal.</p>
<p>This year, New York once screened a "star-studded" film titled "How the West Was Won," distributed by MGM, and compiled and edited by the great director Cecil B. DeMille. The content describes the history of the American West, entirely compiled from various Western history films. The stars who participated in the performance include: Bette Davis, Gary Cooper, Fredric March, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Claudette Colbert, George Raft, Harry Carey Jr., Thelma Ritter, and Don Ameche, etc. That is indeed an unprecedented "star-studded" event. Although we do not have the "pleasure of seeing" it, looking at this list is enough to be "thrilled"!</p>

<p>Hollywood filmmaker William Dieterle recently wrote a letter to the director of "Children of the World," Mr. and Mrs. Auerbach, and his tone showed great concern for China's film industry. The original letter said: "Mr. and Mrs. Auerbach: It is truly gratifying news that you are producing films in Shanghai. Our collaboration on "The Life of Emile Zola" was a happy memory. I know your abilities and believe that you will achieve the greatest success in a very short time, just like you did in Europe. And you will improve Chinese films to the highest level. I hope to see your Chinese films in America in the near future." (Omitted below) William Dieterle.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: William Dieterle was originally a British stage and film actor. After moving to the United States, he became a director, having directed blockbuster films such as "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "The Story of Louis Pasteur." Auerbach has filmed "The Life of Emile Zola" three times, and Dieterle was the male lead in the second version.</p>

<p>— Bei Shi</p>
<p>"Transformation" is Mr. Cao Yu's masterpiece during the war. His works always grasp the significance of the times. Ba Jin once said the following about "Transformation": "From "Thunderstorm" onwards, I have been the first reader of his works. Each of his plays was sent to the readers through me and another friend. He trusted us, as one trusts his true friends. But this book, "Transformation," was an exception. When it came to my attention, the characters and stories in the play had already become topics of discussion among intellectuals everywhere. I opened the mimeographed manuscript and read "Transformation" in one breath under the electric light in my residence in Xicheng Corner, Kunming. I forgot the late hour, forgot the eye pain, forgot the fatigue, my heart was full of happiness, and my eyes were filled with light. The author has indeed brought us hope."</p>
<p>Ba Jin's words are indeed what we want to say in our hearts. In the characters who appear in "Transformation," each has a unique style, such as the righteous Commissioner Liang, the brave Dr. Ding, as well as the outdated Dean Qin and Director Ma, etc. These characters represent two generations in a very special period. The reason why Cao Yu used the title "Transformation" is to say that the old is declining, and the new is rising.</p>
<p>Although "Transformation" depicts a glimpse of a rear hospital, it is just as Ba Jin said: "The author has indeed brought us hope."</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu, a generation of female actors, rose to prominence, embellishing the singing stage and changing the atmosphere of music appreciation. Since then, female opera singers have also known to follow the right path and compete with male actors in appearance and demeanor, no longer like the previous fashionable opera troupes, specializing in seductive appearances to stir people's hearts with beauty. This is a very good phenomenon and a major key to the transformation of the opera world. At that time, Jin Youqin and Zhang Eyun followed in the footsteps of Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu. They were about the same age, and their fame was not too different, so those who liked to meddle compared them to Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun, and the four were hailed as the four famous dan of female actors. However, Jin Youqin married the earliest. She was only popular for a short time before disappearing from the stage. Youqin's appearance is very pure and beautiful. The only drawback is that she has some of Li Xiangjun's regrets; her delicate body is slightly short (as is Zhang Eyun's), but the beauty of her voice can be compared to Xue Yanqin, which Zhang Eyun and Xin Yanqiu cannot match. Her early performances were not based on any school, which was inevitably messy. Later, she hired Xu Lanyuan to specialize in learning from Mei Lanfang, and her reputation soared, but it was also only a flash in the pan, and she soon found a home. Therefore, among the four great female dan, only her talent would not have reached its limit and stopped on its own.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Bloody Rain and Jade Flowers <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17.  Enraged for the Sake of a Beauty</p>
<p>"Liu Zongmin could not find her, so he beat and interrogated all the family members in the residence. One of the young maids couldn't bear the torture and told the truth, so Madam Chen was not spared." When San Gui heard this, his hair stood on end in anger, and his blood rushed upward. He thought to himself that he only loved Yuanyuan in his life. It was rare that Tian Hongyu gave her to me as a gift. I thought that a famous general and a beautiful woman were a natural match, and that we could be together forever and grow old together. But because there was a royal order, I couldn't stay. And because of my father's order, I stayed in the capital. Who would have thought that disaster would come unexpectedly? One miscalculation led to a big mistake. Now the beauty has been taken by Shachili. I am a general only in name, but I can't save Yuanyuan. I have betrayed my seven-foot body! Thinking about it, it's all my father's fault. He shouldn't have been afraid that a fragrant carriage would offend the emperor, or that a fierce wife would be jealous and stir up trouble. In fact, these were all overthinking. Now it's too late to regret. He still wants to come and recruit me to surrender to that thief Li Chuang? The more I think about it, the more I hate it. Anger filled my chest. I drew my sword from my waist and slammed it down on the military desk in front of me and said, "Can there be such an unfortunate thing? If my father is small-minded, how can I follow you to surrender to the enemy?" With a "shu ran" sound, half of the desk was chopped off. The scout was shocked and paled, prostrating on the ground. San Gui shouted, "Get out!" The scout immediately retreated out of the tent. San Gui walked several times in the tent, sat down on the chair, sighed deeply, propped his chin with one hand, frowned, and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, he jumped up again, gritted his teeth and said, "Li Chuang stole my Yuanyuan. This hatred is irreconcilable. How can I let him enjoy the bliss! I vow to kill him in the capital and take back the beauty, to vent this grievance!" (188)</p>
