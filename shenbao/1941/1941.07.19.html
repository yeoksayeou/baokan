<h3>日新閣換湯不換藥基本政策不致變更</h3>
<p>合衆社十八日華盛頓電　　衛本日再度出任首相、即可見在最近之將來、日本政策不致受極端派所操縱、以近衛爲政府之首領、則日本之政策必較爲緩和、日本政界中、曾抨擊軍部而仍維持其政治生命者唯近衛一人而已、近衛曾公然宣稱不能任軍部統治全國、近衛並非隨波遂流之庸弱無能者、渠有極大之勇氣、且或係日本現今之最　著愛國者、渠有一定之計劃而堅決不移、前外相松岡實施之方案、有計多係爲近衛所反對者、渠於六個月之前本可推翻松岡、但恐引起內部變動、現時渠可淸除內部而促日本獲得新出發矣、（按此電係合衆社東京分社長湯姆生所發、湯氏僑日五載現回華盛頓未久）</p>
<p>合衆社十八日紐約電　斯基里浦霍華德各報紙昨日評論宣稱、日本最近之閣潮、不致變更日本之基本政策、即使組織閣新者爲自由派及反軸心派領袖、彼等之政策及性命仍操之於軍事獨裁者之手、日本之政客不過爲軍閥前綫、而眞正之握權者爲恐怖份子、評論主張無論英　在大西洋之需要如何、美國應在太平洋保留其海軍及空軍力量之均衡、此舉較之其他一切更足以防止遠東戰爭云、紐約時報宜稱、近衛內閣二度辭職、表示日本政府係自首至尾的分裂、並透露日本領袖間之政見無法調和云、　　御前會議所決定之政策、乃以政府與軍事當局成立完全妥協爲根據、斷不變更、而欲在未來緊急時期實施此項政策、首應組成全國人民所一致信任服從之政府、內閣所以改組、職是故也、半官機關日本泰晤士報載稱、未來內閣「將以全力擴大政府之政治權力、完成大規模的經濟計劃」、「朝日新聞」稱、新外相之物色問題、將爲近衛改組內閣之主要工作、「讀賣新聞」稱、日本基本政策已定、茲應放棄消極態度、俾此項政策具有積極性及彈性、以應付業已變更的國際形勢云、</p>
<h3>英願保持　遠東和平</h3>
<p>路透廿十八日舊金山電　英國駐美大使哈立法克期動爵、昨在此間聯邦俱樂部發表演說、謂希特勒或將提出和平建議、但余可斷言不論條件如何、均將遭受拒絕、哈氏又論及遠東之局勢云、英國已決定之政策、渠信美政府亦然、即爲儘力保持太平洋之和平是、英國毫無與日本爭鬥之意、日本如願商洽遠東方面與具有影響之各項問題、而對於其他有關各國之權　加以相當之尊重者、則余誠不解何以須發生任何困難、而將引起衝突云、</p>
<h3>日本態度瞻顧徘徊心屢作强烈暗示</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十七日瑞士京城電　日本近衛內閣總辭職之後、歐洲各國之視綫均集在東京、並紛紛揣測此次閣潮之意義、巴塞爾日報載稱、在柏林方面、迭以德義日三國同盟條約爲</p>
<h3>內閣改組主要原因皆在加强政治機構</h3>
<p>瓦斯社十七日東京電</p>
<p>此間政界人士咸認爲第三屆近衛內閣、將爲眞正的戰時內閣、即加强組織、俾能以應付任何事變之謂、此次內閣改組、其主要目的有二、其一、使政府在外交上有更大之自由、以執行七月二日御前會議所決定之國策、其二、則以廣泛之權力　予政府、以統制國民生活、尤其經濟金融機構云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯世界電訊社十八日東京電　此間各報評論內閣改組、僉以內政方面爲重、並謂七月二日言、此在沮利希日報則載稱、自德蘇戰爭爆發以還、日本從未作與德國一致行動之表示，德國政府業已予以諒解、按之事實、日本保守緘默、巳歷一月之久、日本現所遭遇間題之嚴重、可於此獲一明證、至於義國方面、據瑞士電訊社所發出消息、義大利人民報之意見、日本於於美國參戰之可能性與日俱增、不得不於此際說明態度、「當此列强均將參戰之際、日本殆難置身事外」、但謂日本基本政策行將改絃易轍、仰仍難置信、「日內瓦講堰報」載有駐羅馬訪員來電稱、因美國有參戰之可能、故日本不得不決定途徑、此一途徑對於日本雖極危險、但亦有極大裨益云</p>
<p>海通社十八日羅馬　電義國官方對於日近衛內閣總辭職一事力守緘默、義國素不喜顧問他國政事、對於其摯友日本尤甚、負責方面人士深覺遠東形勢已日趨嚴重、義國對於日本所擬採之措施、正以同情目光注視中、義國人民深信日本政策必將以基本國利益爲前提云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>糧食行政之敷施</h3>
<p>自有糧食部成立，而糧食乃亦厠於行政之列。就其大處以言之，土地農業水利諸政策，俱包涵在內。然土地豈僅分配一端，尙須得地之利。農業又豈止肯種改良除蟲而已，須得天之時。水利亦豈僅溝洫隄防之類，尤當兼顧林政。故欲解決糧食一問題，實須多方兼籌，不能着眼於一隅；於分工合作之中，而收指臂之成效也。</p>
<p>自其功用言之，無非爲解決民食問題。然欲解決民食問題，求其足食，則在於產之豐穰。求其以有餘補不足，則在於儲之充牣。求其調準之相宜，則在於連之流暢。求其分配之平勻，則在於銷之管制。四者具而後民食行政之功效，顯然猶未爲解決之上策。蓋爲政在全民之福利，不拘拘於一階級·一種類之利害，而以爲能興利除害。糴甚貴傷民，甚賤傷農，此在二千三百餘年前李悝已言之。故惟有產銷平準，民農兼顧，而後民不病其貴，農不害其賤；舉熙熙攘攘，樂其業而享其利，斯爲民食問題之成功　　中國號稱以農立國，而無如饑饉代有，振恤不絕；倉儲制度，發達雖早，制作雖良，仍無以舒民食之急，說者不無以爲疑。實則中國在最近二千餘年來，名爲重農，而農之地位實賤；名爲賤商，而商之地位實尊，戰國秦漢以來已如此。時亦未嘗不思耕者有其田，致力於均田授分之制，以迄於唐，不爲無人。但仍無以解決農民之土地問題，生產問題者，一則農民生活利於安定，而戰亂頻仍，饑患迭作。農民之生產本薄弱，一經顚沛流離，盡喪所有，於是乘機而兼併之風大盛。二則中國農民爲中國唯一之生產者，亦即一切負担之最後歸歸宿者，賦稅出於農，商賈鬻販之利綠於農，高利盤剝在於農。而一言農之生產能力，實至脆薄，委心任運聽於天，水旱虫害歸於命，剝削操縱由於人，利益之歸諸人者多，而享諸己者少，於是饑荒之來，反以生產見稱之農民首受其殃。三則農民墨守耕種舊法，雖有其良好經驗，但亦缺乏應變求進之本能；又加以不受敎育，而少吸新吐故之機會，緣是地位日益凌夷，乃成爲人羣中之被壓迫者。故歷代未嘗不於政法之名義上抑商崇農，而農終無由抬頭者，智識限制之、財力束縛之，社會勢力桎梏之也。</p>
<p>徵收實物，在中國舊時農業生產制度下早已皆然，所謂本色是也。自商業資本逐漸發展，唐德宗改征夏秋兩稅，以錢穀定稅，於是用錢緡及其後用銀兩上稅者爲大宗，本色亦多以折色行之，而實物之徵收寖廢。淸末民初積穀與積錢之論爭頗烈。顧當時之所以力主積穀不如積錢者，正有鑒於積穀之辦理不易，積錢之運用自如。今則似又趨向於積錢不如積穀矣。諒爲物價昂貴，幣値低落，收折色不如收本色之爲實際也。由可知積錢積穀，非如狙公賦芋之智不相逮，而爲時代之變遷使然。但實物之徵收綦難，折耗重重，何所取償。取償於納稅人，則舊時火耗之一類問題（火耗本指銀言，糧米亦有耗，乃亦併言、）將以起，是否不爲額外之徵收乎？如耗歸於公，則耗折之多寡，爲承辦官吏之責任問題，刻扣侵肥而不足，踢斛淋尖而俱來，弊將由是而滋生。何况尙有徵收上種種手續，納稅人種種弊竇，以及一地之人風政情，俱有兼籌並顧之必要。尤當注意者，聚糧之時，糧價往往爲吸收而昂貴；返糧之時，又爲外放而平落。若還之以陳糧，則糧之爲糧，不知何如。還之以新糧，則一出一納，仍爲農商。觀於歷代常平倉之出陳易新，利弊互見，可以爲法矣。竊糧政一端，規模遠大，向以分屬於諸部，未能統籌萬端，著有良模。今則旣有負責建設之專部，必能澈底爲中國糧產民食，軍糈積儲，建立丕基，奠定民生。此不僅十五年來，社會人士，民食問題之鼓吹提倡，至今如朝曦初露，始有發揚光大之望；而民生主義之實現，吃飯問題之解決，胥於此利賴焉！</p>
<h3>英報檢討日本政策統治東亞徒成迷夢</h3>
<p>路透社十八日倫敦電泰晤士報昨載長文檢討日本政策、顯爲「日本之夢想與現實」、首述十六世紀以還之日本外交政策、追叙其隔離閉關自守主義之經過情形、機謂今之中國事件、已予人以日本統治東亞的野心非僅爲夢想的明證、歐戰旣起、近衛內閣認爲絕好機會、乃決定傾向其所認爲定獲勝利之國家、以便事前得其同意、使日本得分獲其勝利品、而剷除日本途徑中所有之障碍、松岡所著關於日本世界使命之新書、內稱日本目的之梗概約在三十年內可使人共曉、而在五十年內可開始、產生效果、據非官塲但權威方面之言論、日本目的包括在第一百八十度子午綫與阿刺伯海中問所有各地在內、凡印度馬來澳洲與世界半數人民皆羅致　中、而其將來統治之形式可於名爲獨立實爲日本屬地的滿洲國之構造中及日本外務省機關日本時報所載勝利國要求、（一）英美將自直布羅陀至夏威夷各要點改爲小駐兵區域、（二）太平洋歐人領土悉予獨立自治、而以日人爲其政府顧問、使共榮圈內各種合作形式得臻合理化之和平條件中見之、雖日方政治家皆以日本未有土地野心、及憎惡西方帝國主義爲言、但亦公然聲稱、凡不誠摯或不理解日本眞正意旨如中國者、定將受其鞭　、近衛內閣完贊同納粹所擬分世界爲四個或五個集團之辦法、（一）爲德義集團、歐非兩洲全部屬爲、（二）爲蘇維埃集團、包括東亞與中亞部份、（三）爲美利堅集團、南北美洲屬焉、（四）爲英帝國集團、但以英國依允妥洽的和局爲條件、（五）爲大東亞集團、以日本爲領導、日本爲進行其目的起見、一面傾注其新努力以從事對蔣委員長之戰事、並擬增强南京政權以推進和平運動、一面進兵越南强迫調解泰越之土地爭點、並締結可使日本開拓越南利源之商約、惟日本此種政策遭遇兩種頓挫，一爲蔣委員長之繼續抵抗、一爲荷印之態度、日本於此無怪疑及其幕者、乃美國援助有以致之、而日本報紙亦力詆荷印政府、指爲英美之傀儡、是以日本至此遇有先須對英美解決、而後始能進行其計畫、或脫出其在華窘境之必要、但日本對此雖有種種建議、終不能如願以償、近衛內閣現不放棄其政策、亦唯有保持其英美終必失敗之理想而已、日本報紙固大聲叫號、指英美失敗必不可免、然大多數日人則不信其說、且漸覺日木之入歧途矣、較有保守性質之日本政治家不願作冒險行動者、及一般商人知日本繁榮緊於對外貿易（戰前日本對民治國之貿易佔全額百分之七十）者、皆未見日本開罪英美之必要、事有可注意者、日本應助德義參戰之說、已被斥爲德方第五縱隊之工作、惟日本國策之目的爲全國所贊同、此乃無可否認者、故今之唯一問題、厥在政府所採途徑是否適當耳、日人皆欲見其國家代有英美等白人在大東亞之權利、但不願出以禍及國家之代價、日人固爲現實主義者也、一九三六年二月二十六日之軍事叛變雖被蕩平、然其潛伏之思想猶爲新機構之基礎、不過日本之全能制度爲三種因素所阻遏、一爲國會雖云無力、然在上屆會議時猶表示其所預期之力量、二爲保守份子、此派以內相平沼爲領袖、三爲較高之陸軍領袖、彼等曾由慘苦經營、發覺軍人與官僚之統制實業、不獨不增高其效率、且反使生產大减、因此內閣乃羅致軍人與事業界中人之從事於小倉所指導的經濟戰爭者共同組織之、此即目前日本內閣所有之槪况也、</p>

<h3>徐謨出使澳洲</h3>
<p>中華民國和澳大利亞聯邦決定互換使節，澳國已由外相史都華特宣布，中國亦於五月十四日由外部公表，謂鑒於太平洋現狀，中澳亟應互派使節。經過兩個月來的遴選首任公使人選，澳方已決定派埃格爾斯坦爲首任駐華大使，中國亦預定以歷任外次多年之徐謨充任。此在中澳外交史上，是開闢了新紀元，尤其澳大利亞在太平洋上目前地位之重要，互派使節，是一件很可注視的事。</p>
<p>做過中學敎員曾任新聞記者</p>
<p>徐謨，字叔模，吳縣人，才智卓越，學識精湛，爲外交界傑出人才。他早年畢業北大法科，留擊美國，得法政學碩士，是民國八年外交官考試最優等第一名。他在江蘇第八中學當過敎員，也担任過新聞記者，在上海當過臨時法院推事兼刑庭庭長。後來歷任外部參事，歐美司長，江蘇交涉員，現任外部政務次長。他滿口吳儂軟語，身材短小，在外交界短小精悍的人物，他和許世英，蔣廷黻鼎足而三。他從來很靜默，而富有很强的記憶力，外交上各種條約，幾乎都可以背誦，這是他天才特點之一。</p>
<p>太平洋風雲中佔重要的一環</p>
<p>講到澳大利亞，在今日太平洋風雲中，極占重要的一環。牠派遣遠征軍，替英國製造飛機，在人力物力，對於英國的幫助，是很偉大的。牠農牧之盛，蘊藏之富，將來必爲世界一重要經濟國家。人口七百餘萬，而軍火生產超過印度，遠逾加拿大，每年產金値上一千一百萬鎊，銀値五百萬鎊。工廠生產年値四萬一千四百餘萬鎊。羊毛生產居世界第一位。</p>
<p>爲民治而奮鬥兩國永敦睦誼</p>
<p>澳大利亞和中國的關係，過去雖具友誼，未臻密切，民國二十三年澳聯邦副總揆兼外長藍山氏率者察團來華，謁中國當局。藍氏歸國後，即任波登氏爲澳州駐華商務專員，駐節上海。秋間，澳女童軍六十人來華觀光，在邦交上始漸增進。直至木年，中國現任外長郭泰棋，與英，澳各方洽談，中澳均感有亟速互派使節的必要，乃於最近遴定人選。中澳兩國，在不遠的將來，不但增進了兩國的友誼，對於世界的貢獻，必定有着光輝的前途。</p>
<p>即將出國使澳之許謨</p>

<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　路透社外交記者稱、關於報載國外傳來日方現以壓力加諸維希迫其放棄越南根據地之消息、今日英方官塲稱、本月初上海已有此同樣消息傳來、駐日英大使克萊琪以此質諸日當局、日外次當即切實聲明此說不確、英官塲又稱、如日方不顧其聲明而藉壓力與威脅或藉兵力在康　灣等處設立根據地、則此種步驟將使日本更與他國所有之土地相接近矣、倫敦與華盛頓現仍如前以密切之注意視察時局、昨日英軍總司令樸芳在新加坡吿路透訪員之言、可見遠東英當局之縱事戒備、至於日內閣之辭職此時尚未能發表批評、惟據東京消息、日內閣之改組旨在成立更有力之政府、以應付國內與國際局勢、查日本近來確有可使日本人民對於前途發生期望與焦慮之徵象、如日本第二大口岸神戶之封閉十日、後備兵之召集與軍隊之調動等是、凡此種種、便日本以壓力加諸維希之說更為有力、德國雖寗願見日本在蘇聯後門發難、但亦未可於此時援助其維希附庸而反對其遠東軸心國同志也、</p>
<p>路透社十八日馬尼刺電　觀察家雖表示數星期內日本將南趨越南之意見、但負責軍事界則不願討論日本目的及其南進動作之傳說、自一九三　年起、日本所採國際政策之基石、不外乎向外開拓、過去十年來開拓趨向顯在南方、目前尤為不戰而可向南深進之絕好機會、蓋敘利亞事件已表示法國領土崩潰瓦解、法人雖欲保衛越南、亦有所不能也、有識方面咸信日本將於數星期內進取越南而奪其軍事要點如康瀾灣等處、因日本力能為此而不致引起民治國方面之衝突也、日內閣之變更、殆為主張侵略之軍閥所促成、此亦為日本行將有所舉動之一證、此外尚有其他表徵、即近來日軍之調動與日本大商船之徵用是、日本現方急需外匯、茍無極好理由決不肯徵用商船、致自招金融上巨大損失、且若運兵不多亦無需許多船隻、然日本今竟徵用大批商船、可見其欲駐兵十萬至十二萬五千人於越南南疆以防英國與泰國、並據有軍事根據地、為將來進窺馬來與荷印之張本也、雖進攻馬來非短時間內所能實現、但日本不妨待之、其故以越南幅員頗廣、暫時儘可供可囊括也、據有識者意見、日本此時如攻西比利亞將無所獲、故不致北進、蓋若蘇聯為德所欲得者、若蘇德戰爭拖長、則蘇聯勢將撤其遠東駐軍以固西疆、而日本屆時亦可處於更優之進攻地位也、就全局通盤察之、日本南進之期殆不在遠、其主要原因厥為民治國之願為法作戰、但若日本進攻香港·菲列濱、馬來或荷印、則勢必引起民治國方面之迅速行動也、</p>

<h3>美陸軍參謀長　勸吿美國備戰　悲慘局勢將臨西半球　美國會應宣佈國家緊急狀態</h3>
<p>合眾社十八日華盛頓電　陸軍參謀長馬歇爾大將、昨吿參院軍事委員會稱、陸軍今已預知西班牙葡萄牙及非洲將相繼墮入軸心之手、並警吿稱、美國正遭遇一「悲劇的局勢、」除非美國有作戰之準備、渠稱、世界今日正遭遇一「龐大之軍事行動、」此軍事行動開始於奧地利、現已延至蘇聯、此作戰之機構每次在一處發動、其他未被波及之國家則為條約及貿易協定所催眠、無疑地吾人如無作戰之準備、則悲慘的局勢將臨於吾人之身、吾人因不能以一己之安全作孤注之一擲也、馬歇爾云、陸軍素採保守政索、惟素對希特勒政府之行動、作針鋒相對之準備、渠稱、外傳德國有陸軍三百師團、其中二十師團係鐵甲部隊、又稱、美國現正以財力供給巴西拓大空軍軍備、使西半球處於週密之保護中、以應付「流氓式之某國、」又稱、美水兵佔領冰島者、因美國陸軍隊伍缺乏足以他調之官員、而陸軍目前之入伍員及後備軍、復無調至西半球以外之法理許可、馬歇爾大將又稱、國會對延長入伍員及國衛軍之服役日期、是否將加接受或否決、八月一日實為最後期限云、</p>
<p>路透社十八日華盛頓電　陸軍參謀長馬歇爾又對參院軍事委員會陳述意見、力言在軍事立塲上、國會宣布國家緊急狀態存在之絕對必要、俾兵士入伍之一年期限、得以展長、馬歇爾稱、吾人僅於上年着手進行吾人能為使人驚奇之工作、吾人可臻於保障吾人一切利益之堅强地位、今若半途中止、實為不智、蓋就陸軍部所見、目前時局至為嚴重、惟陸軍部不能發表其關於新近發展之情報耳、如兵士入伍期以一年為限、則陸軍部將不能應付裕如、陸軍部迄未能派遣二十四架戰鬥機之機隊前往冰島、以增該處水兵之實力、如謂渠有組織海外遠征隊之意、則實屬荒謬云、</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（六）（九）</p>
<h3>美國擴充海軍現狀</h3>
<p>美國擴充海軍已達白熱化的階段。美國現有戰鬭艦共十五艘，新近落成三艘，尚有十四艘在建造中。第一綫巡洋艦現有三十七艘，在建造中者五十四艘。航空母艦現有六艘，在建造中者十二艘。驅逐艦，除以　舊的九十艘讓給英國外，尚存一百六十四艘，在建造中者七十八艘，其中「吐多格」號等艘排水量達一千七百五十噸，與驅逐艦不相上下。此外還有魚雷汽艇無算。</p>
<p>戰鬭艦的建造，向被認為工程最大最費時日，今年上半年內，竟一氣完成三艘，都較預定時間提早五六個月，真是一樁　舉。三艦一名「北加羅利那」號，係於今年四月間在紐約勃洛克林海軍船塢下水；一名「華盛頓」號，係於五月間在費城下水；另一艘名「南達科泰」號，係於六月初在紐遮賽州卡姆頓港下水，排水量各三萬五千噸。美國兩洋艦隊的新戰鬭艦十七艘，至此已完成三艘了。</p>
<p>美國海軍自一九二三年十二月造成戰鬭艦「摩薩斯特」號後，迄無何項偉大建樹，此次「北加羅利那」號首先完成，實為美國海軍史上劃時代的一頁。該艦係於一九三七年十月二十七日海軍節按置龍骨，原定須至今年九月一日完竣，結果提早五個月落成了。造價原來估計為六七，七二五，五〇〇美元，但全部裝配完竣後，恐將達七千萬美元。全艦官兵共一千五百名。</p>
<p>「北加羅利那」號，「華盛頓」號和「南達科泰」號次第落成後，大約至七月間即可正式編入艦隊，屆時美國海軍共有戰鬭艦十八艘，在質量方面，堪稱舉世無敵。但在數量上所佔的優勢為時恐不能久。英國原有戰鬭艦十五艘，新造的三艘，完成在即。待至年底，日本亦將完成新戰鬭艦兩艘，所有戰鬭艦總數將增至十二艘。</p>
<p>至於世界各海軍國現有戰鬭艦及至今年年底可造成的戰鬭艦總數大抵如下：</p>
<p>國別　現在艦數　年底艦數</p>
<p>美國　十五艘　十八艘</p>
<p>英國　十五艘　十七或十八艘</p>
<p>日本　十艘　十二艘</p>
<p>德國　四艘　四艘</p>
<p>義大利　五六艘　五六艘</p>
<p>蘇聯　三艘　三艘</p>
<p>法國　二艘　二艘</p>
<p>上表中英國已損失的戰鬭艦如「荷特」號等均不列入。德國除第一綫戰艦外，尚有袖珍戰鬭艦一艘，（另一艘俾斯麥號，最近已被英國擊沉）及改充練習艦的舊戰艦兩艘。法國的「鄧寇克」號和「斯特拉斯堡」號，前往西菲奧朗港受創甚重，諒已修復，法國碩果僅存的戰鬭艦大約盡在於此。</p>
<p>就美國戰艦的質地而論，各國無能望其項背。「北加羅利那」號各姊妹艦標準排水量三萬五千噸（實際載重約三萬八千噸至三萬九千五百噸）；艦身在水平綫上長七百零四英尺，闊一百零八英尺（較巴拿馬運河現有水閘，僅狹兩英尺），平均吃水量二十六英尺八寸。</p>
<p>艦身架設十六英寸口徑四十五英寸圓徑大砲九門，分裝三聯砲塔三座，每分鐘內能向十五英哩以外的目標，發射砲彈二十噸左右。輪機為四螺旋推進機，尾部裝有雙舵。</p>
<p>該艦四聯輪機可發動十一萬五千匹馬力，每小時速率二十七海里以上。所裝巨型輔助砲可以攻擊　　艦和飛機，小口徑的各種高射砲林立。平時載偵察機三架，必要時可以增加。全身所裝鐵甲，在戰鬭距離內，可抵擋十六英寸直徑的砲彈和飛機的炸彈，艦底除裝鐵甲三重外，並有密度分水配備，以測騐魚雷或水雷的損害程度。</p>
<p>「北加羅利那」號比較英國新造的「喬治五世」號，實力史為勁强。美艦架設十六英寸口徑九門，英艦僅架設十四英寸口徑砲十尊，美艦的輔助砲威力尤大，英艦在速率上或較美艦快一二海里，也未可知，但美艦裝甲之厚，非具所及。</p>
<p>「北加羅利那」號優於法國的「鄧扣克」號和「斯特拉斯堡」號（排水量二萬六千五百噸，備十三寸口徑砲八門）及德國，的「香好斯脫」號和「格奈生拿」號（排水量二萬六千噸，備十一英寸口徑砲九尊），是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>德國的新戰鬭艦「俾士麥」號（已被英國擊沉）和「鐵爾畢資」號，艦身長七百三十英尺，較「北加羅利那」號長出二十六英尺，闊一百十八英尺，超過美艦十英尺，其他各國艦身的闊度，無與匹敵。該艦所架十五英寸口徑砲八門，火力雖不及美艦十六英寸九門的强大，但係分裝四座砲塔，　分散火力的便宜。美艦的輔助砲較　艦優越，但德艦速率較大。德艦排水量三萬五千噸，平均載重量可達三萬七千五百噸。</p>
<p>日本在建造中的新艦，詳情不得而知，預料較「北加羅利那」級各艦為大，排水量四萬噸左右，架十六英寸口徑砲八門或九門，每小時速率二十九至三十海里。</p>
<p>「北加羅利那」號和他的姊妹艦「華盛頓」號及「南達科泰」號，即當編入美國第一綫艦隊。目下美國太平洋艦隊保有戰鬭艦十二艘，實際已罄其所有，在大西洋保有火力不遠的　式戰鬭艦三艘。有此生力軍加入之後，美國在兩洋的實力，自當刮目相看了。</p>

<p>近日紗市亦的混亂局面口、客銷旺、市價反向下、現貨交易淸、市盤則能上升、足使人心飄忽靡定、實則對於雙馬廠單、有一部份大戶時收時放之故也、一般小投機的人們、隨波逐流、頻頻吃虧、所以盤旋之勢頗强也、又有一郁、市面本有下降可能、無奈有多頭公司織組、計四大名家擁軋廠單、因此市况被撑住矣、但又一議論、此番由一千三百七十二元、直升至一千六百四十五元之高峯、其中有幾家大量拋空之額、僅的一千四百元左右賣出、豈偶粵幫來了一批交易、於是市盤步步提上、空頭無力支持而倒閉、不過目前拋賣之額甚微、二則的低檔時、未曾盤足、雖有多頭組織、然缺乏籌碼可擠也、彝此而論、實銷興繁、基礎當固、否則或來一記反面文章也、多頭掉期貼出一元半、最後為七角半、空頭收進利鈾、二十支雙馬市價為一千五百九十四元、低價為一千五百八十七元、午後初做一千五百九十六元、升至一千六百零七元、最後價為一千六百零一·二元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開即堅昂、因多頭公司關係、散戶急補、首盤價一千五百八十九元、直升至一千五百九十四元、後以標金平平、客銷二十支紗仍不動、港幫僅買三十二支六十五包、人心平平、跌至一千五百八十七元、迨至收盤價為一千五百九十二元、收後做九十四元、查半日間成交統計六千五百六十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如打、香港　六五　同行六、五〇〇</p>
<p>統計六、五六五</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、因外滙與金價個股報緊俏、且本月期停拍的邇、空戶乏貨交解者相率抵補、故漲勢頗銳、七月期較昨漲十元、八月期漲八元、拍至九月多頭稍有轉賣、獨跌五元半、開後忽聞美棉漲跌不一、印棉回跌、而香港幫需要形同停頓、多頭復　轉賣、七月期曾小至一千四百三十六元、八月期一千四百五十二元半、九月期平定、入後以金價極形有力、新買與補空頻起、價遂重趨上昇、午收七月期漲十元、八月期漲八元、九月起漲四元半、成交七千九百七十包、後市有傳某方接收某會之郁、七月份曾高至一千四百四十五元、八月期一千四百六十六元、九月期一千五百二十四元半、價則先漲後回、結果七月期比上日漲九元、八月期漲十元、九月期漲六元、全日共成交一萬三千四百二十包、比上日减少二千一百十包、再將全日開收高低價錄打、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>印棉成交絕旺</h3>
<p>現棉情况雖堅定、然廠方成交不旺、不過人心依然挺秀、但細絨棉價已達相當的高度、銷路較减、投機買賣之目標、已移向粗絨上做矣、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉定貨交易、人心興奮、購意熱烈、各方鑒於訂購美印棉頗費手續、而轉向現貨交易甚力、同時更因廠需較切、而市况步堅、連日除同業轉售大批印棉及巴西棉外、各廠方亦成交棉近千包右左</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因投機者賣出而跌、但續後又因同業及外商買進而回漲、結果收盤價格較之上日漲跌二三磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市頗屬平淡、因有投機者賣出、及遠東局勢混亂而跌、昨日收盤價格、各跌二三羅比左右、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看漲〇·七五羅比、</p>

<h3>粉市稍見轉好</h3>
<p>昨日現洋粉市况、稍見回好、因連日鬆疲、價位漸低、本客實銷、趁低稍有進了、囤戶方面、鑒於匯縮金漲、亦有發動之意、故市面由疲轉堅、計開金龍粉三十一元九角至三十二元、及砲台粉三十二元八角至八角半、成交總計一萬包有奇、雜牌交易不多、聞有直接配客者、價亦帶堅、市面脚地漸形鞏固、小麥仍無市</p>

<h3>以社會福利為前提　煤氣核減附加費　公司自願實行毅力可偑　其他公用事業應加取法　議案已經公用事業委員會宣吿通過</h3>
<p>本月十七日下午、啊部局公用事業委員會召開會議時、曾討論一令人聞之欣悅之議案、即為上海英商自業火公司請求減少附加費之建議、該建議提出後、當經該會縝密協議、僉以减價之舉、旣由公司自願實行、當無阻止之理、遂即宣吿通過、</p>
<p>附加費約减三成半</p>
<p>嗣後記者自靈通方面獲悉、自來火公司請求减少附加費之數目、大約為百分之三十五左右、按該公司附加費憶徵收至百分之二百五十、所减之數、雖屬微細、但的目下各項公用事業一再增價之際、獨自來火公司能顧念用戶之負擔、而毅然宣佈减價、其以公眾利益為念之精神、無疑將獲得市民之同情與欽佩、聞該公司實行减價之原因、為生產設備合理化與副產物產量增加之故、亦即開源與節流之結果、</p>
<p>公用事業　應予效法</p>
<p>因之一般市民均聯想及公共租界其他公用事業之增價、尤其電車及公共汽車最近增價達百分之六十以上之一舉、使生活遭遇一新的苛重負擔、一般人雖對電車及公共汽車公司迭進忠吿、勸其能開源節流、但顯未獲得效果、售票員揩油之風、盛行如故、即其明證、因此市民於聞悉自來火公司實行减價之消息後、莫不盼望其他各公用事業、亦能追隨其後、厲行開源節流、俾减輕市民負擔、而挽回所謂公用事業之信譽、</p>
<p>下星期四　正式公布</p>
<p>又聞自來火公司此項减價提議、雖經公用事業委員會通過、但尚須提交於下星期三下午四時半召集之啊部局常會予以批准、下星期四可望有關於此事之公報發表、一般相信、此案之實行、已可無疑問、</p>
<p>南洋煤斤　運滬日增</p>
<p>本市前因運煤輪隻缺乏、到貨稀少、煤商把持囤貨、市價猛漲、如啊廠所用之烟煤、暨住戶所用之煤球原料煤屑、莫不飛漲、匝月以來、因太平洋局勢漸明、越南鴻基煤暨婆羅洲·印度·基隆等處煤斤數量、運滬極鉅、存底充足、市價趨跌、而市民日常所需之煤球、亦已由十七元跌至十五元八角、或至十六元、昨日又有烟煤一萬噸運抵本市、</p>

<p>電力當局　盼望實現</p>
<p>據電力公司總裁霍浦金吿記者、彝渠所知電力公司自一九三七年起與開　礦務局商妥按月從華北運煤二萬五千噸來滬接濟之辦法、並無變更云、本市開　分局主任魏君亦謂、渠未知曾有增加此煤斤數額之磋商、查上海電力公司之燃料接濟、以開　煤為主、關係方面對於哈瓦斯社所傳消息、雖不置信、惟霍浦金希望此訊屬實、至於載煤來滬之船隻問題亦無重大變化</p>

<h3>接受文明的恩賜</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>世界上的人，誰不愛惜自己的性命呢？</p>
<p>為了要救活人命，科學家與醫學界的人士，不知在實騐室中耗費了多少的心血，時間與精神，消磨多少的精力與生命。他們的犧牲是重大的，可是他們的努力並不是徒然的。</p>
<p>自從巴斯德發明了種痘，後來的醫學界又相繼發明了打防疫針以後，不知救活了多少寳貴的性命。這是人類文明的眞恩賜！這些恩賜，便利，與保障，都是白白地賜給我們的。人羣是科學家努力的目標。祗要人類能得到這些恩賜，他們就心滿意足了，他們並不回我們索還任何的代價。</p>
<p>然而世界實在是無奇不有的。為公衆服務的白衣人在路上替人免費打防疫針，儘有許多繞道疾走，避之唯恐不及的人。醫院林立，醫生到處都有，然而他們不肯打針，他們怕痛，他們怕輕微的發熱，他們均臂膀痠腫，他們以為打防疫針是多餘的事。他們不願意接受偉大的人類忠僕的恩賜。</p>
<p>要是巴圳德地下有知，不知將作何感想？</p>
<p>即使不是為了自己，那麼為了公衆的衛生，為了做其他較無知的下屬社會民衆的好模範，我們都該踴躍忍受那刹那間的輕微的痛楚，去接受這文明的禮物。</p>

<h3>我愛北碚</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>我們的團體是流動性的，所以我們也隨着踏遍了整個川中，不過大部份的時間，還是逗留在北碚。</p>
<p>北焙，我就是愛這塊地方，她像上海的江灣一般，平淡中帶着嫵媚，豪爽！慣居重慶的人，偶然到這裏小住一下，準會使您覺得無形的愉曠！</p>
<p>現在的北碚，已經不是醫生的集中地了，代起為主人翁的，就是充着朝氣的學生們！從「俺咱」的山東老鄕起，到「嘸懂得」的廣東姑娘止，都在書本上發掘他們的前程！他們苦學的精神，够叫一班捧着洋裝書當裝飾品的羞愧？</p>
<p>說起「洋裝書」，在內地是一個很生疏的名字了。高中以上的課本，全都是土紙講義，不止土紙，油墨也是土烟做的，難得幾本破字典豎在書架上，已經够神氣的了。　　　生活程度，一點不比重慶低；大米每市石四百元，肉三元一斤，鷄蛋也漲到三毛錢一只，因此，錢是不能隨便花的了，當心您的肚子要叫哩！</p>
<p>說苦吧，的確相當的苦，但「怨」苦的人，郤找不到一個，「苦」已經造成了堅忍不拔的意志，所以「苦」不必冉作嘴裏的嘆息！</p>
<p>一個新從北方來的朋友吿訴我！</p>
<p>「天津人的眉是「八」字形的，上海人的眉是「一」字形的，重慶人的眉郤是「〇」字形的」。</p>
<p>她的意思：天津所見的是一張哭臉，上海是一張愁臉，是重慶卻是張笑臉，——不止笑臉，還帶着氣臉！</p>
<p>的確，不單是重慶，北碚，整個大內地所顯示的，却是愉快！沉毅！積極！</p>
<p>「不放鬆自己」！不是口號，不是借條，乃是行動！</p>
<p>我的工作雖忙得可以，但，也是一般地愉快！給榮譽的勇士們治病，至少自己覺得有點榮譽的。當他們述說一些前綫風光時，陡使我們的心活躍起來。</p>
<p>一件事是奇特的，奇特得與我們同在一塊的美國大夫扳起大姆指來！</p>
<p>就是沒有一個傷兵是「頽化」的，他們給對方的估價，一致地脫不了「不足道」三字！</p>
<p>您問我「把握」兩個字，我想這「不足道」已經够象微了吧？總之，隨着時間和空間的進展，信念已經是一個緊握了的老拳。</p>
<p>我們就是等着瞧這老拳所發揮的力量！</p>

<h3>自然界的音樂家</h3>
<p>— 江水</p>
<p>公園里紅花似錦，綠草如茵，無疑的，我們知道：「又是鳥兒們歌唱的時候了。」但這里要請諸位讀者們留意。大自然的音樂家，不祗是這些飛鳥而已：此外還有那些昆蟲，靑蛙，蟾蜍之類，也正是自然界里出名的「貝多芬」與「莫柴脫」呢。</p>
<p>在昆蟲中，最著名的音樂家當推蟬了。他們有一種很奇怪的發音器官。更奇怪的，這種器官只有雄蟬有，雌蟬是沒有的。所以許多人就說：「這乃是蟬哥哥實在唱得太好了的緣故，才替他配上個啞妻子，否則豈不格外要被人們羨慕嗎？」可憐呀，雌蟬的肚皮只不過比雄蟬尖一些，她就祇能做「啞吧」了。至於他們的孩子－－幼蟲－呢，都住在很深的地下室里，以樹根當作食物。牠們比別人家的孩子有一點地方不同，就是要在地下空里住一個長久的時期。在美國，有一種蟬非得滿足十七歲，可不允他出門一步。雄蟬的發音器官就是一對像鼓樣的膜，位於腹部底下，由於强有力的肌肉的振盪，膜一受激刺，聲音就發出來了。他們唱歌的動機，據說就是為了想吸引異性的伴侶。</p>
<p>另外有一種昆蟲音樂家－蚱蜢。專門喜勸在晚間舉行音樂會。女太太小姐們穿起了那種明亮的綠衣裳，上面閃耀着點點白得像珍珠般的斑點，再配上了美麗的品紅色的花邊，那才誘人呢。</p>
<p>最後還有一種靑蛙。據一般熱悉他們的知己說：「他們的歌唱純粹是為了快樂，所以到了六七月里他們仍是歡喜唱。」至靑蛙嘴的里層，生有一對氣囊，呼吸時空氣從鼻孔里打進去，因此回響特別來得大。如果有幾十只或幾百只靑蛙唱起大合奏來的話，即使遠在一哩路外，亦準會聽到他們的聲音。這秤氣囊，非但是他們的樂器，幷且還是他們安置孩子—蝌蚪的臥房啊。　　自然界的音樂家眞不止這幾個，請你隨時去發現吧。</p>
<h3>新戒酒法  增修</h3>
<p>紐約有兩位醫師，發明了一種科學化的戒酒法，據說成成效卓著，値得介紹。　　那兩位醫師將一種能够使人嘔吐的藥劑，注入酒徒的體中，然後請那些酒徒坐在一間陳設富麗的酒吧間裏面。藥性發作以後，醫師請他們儘量喝酒，一杯一杯地灌下去，直到藥性停止才罷。這種方法，實行了一星期，結果那些酒徒，不必再注射藥劑，看見了酒瓶就想嘔吐，因此戒絕了傷神費財的嗜好。</p>

<h3>母子合用的防毒面具</h3>
<p>— 沈剛</p>
<p>近年有人發明一種可供母子二人合用的防毒面具，把嬰孩放在一個不透空氣的橢圓形囊中，母親則帶防毒面具。因為呼吸設備安排得非常巧妙，母親將空氣吸入容氣中，不僅足够她自己用，而且還可以供她的孩子用。因為嬰孩的呼吸普通都是很弱的，不能掀動活塞把新鮮的空氣吸入肺中。所以這種新式的防毒面具，對「未來的主人翁」們實在是裨益不淺的。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>幾十天來，因為時常在吳家出入的緣故，孟家的媳婦對於秋海棠的不捨得為自己多化一個錢的怪脾氣，已經也很有些認識了。</p>
<p>「這個我知道。」她微笑着點了點頭。「其實他老人家在錢的上面，何必這樣想不透呢？」</p>
<p>因為年紀一天一天的大起來，梅寳對於她父親的經濟狀况，就漸漸地明白了，從前所有的那種觀念，以為他父親的苦吃苦用純粹是一個傻子，現在她心裏可再也不這麼想了。</p>
<p>「嫂子，你們是開着舖子做賣買的，錢出去了還可以回來；咱們家的情形可就不同了。」梅寳低下頭，把那藍布短襖上才沾到的灰土用手指撣去了一些。「一年十二月，祇有兩三個月可以賣掉一些麥干豆子，收進很少的一些錢，餘下的十個月，簡直儘把洋錢鈔票送出去。你想那得叫我爸爸不愁呢？」</p>
<p>這一下可又合了孟家媳婦兒的口味了；今天，她家裏本來沒有事，正間得發慌，特別是那張最歡喜說話的嘴，敎它閉上着不動，眞比死還難受；現在經不起梅寳跟她一提家務，她的興緻，便立刻湧起來了。</p>
<p>「論理，咱們兩家是大門對大門的近鄰，應該總比別家親熱些；可是說也笑話，咱們當家的跟我公公兩個，一天到晚儘忙着在做賣買，因此一直就不曾跟你們爸爸親近過，大家倒像顯得怪生分的……的。」她那流利淸脆的聲音，聽在梅寳的耳朶裏，眞像是一頭叫得最煩絮的黄螢一樣。「難得妹妹你不把我當外人，什麽事都跟我說，那末我也要不客氣的問問你了。你們家裏畢竟種着多少田？你爸爸在外面可還有什麼賣買做着沒有？這幾年田裏的收成能不能抵得過一家的吃用？還有，除了這樟樹屯以外，別處你們可再有什麽親戚嗎？」（一六二）</p>

<h3>狄安娜竇萍談婚後生活</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>欲享家庭之樂者—値得一讀</p>
<p>十八歲姑娘狄安娜竇萍，如今已是一位有夫之婦了。她與馮保羅的事結合，曾獲得影迷們一致的讚許，認為是「天作之合」，祝頌他們白頭偕老。所以，一般人都急於要知道她的婚後生活如何？現的她做了兩個月新娘之後，坦白地對各界發話了。</p>
<p>儷影　在竇萍起坐室的鋼琴上邊，懸掛着一張五彩的雙人照片，她穿着一件樸素的白色襯衣，在棕色的髪項上加以白的絲帶。馮御着白底黑條的襯衫，把竇萍挽在自己的胸前，傲然地顯出丈夫的姿態。「這一張照片是我倆在結婚前一星期拍的。」她指着照片說。</p>
<p>獻花　「他非但是個十全十美的丈夫，」她驕傲地郁：「而且是一個思想的情人，他從來不會忘掉我的工作日程，我們的約會，或是我們第一次見面的日子。到了該送我鮮花的日子，他沒有一次會忘記。假使遇到我不舒服，或是他工作忙不能伴我出游的時候，也總要選些上等鮮花來安慰我。」</p>
<p>性情　「他又十分注意體貌，即使是細微末節也不忽略。我每次進房時他總要立起身來，雖然屋中只有我們兩人。不過他有時會無故煩惱，逢到這時候，只有隨他怎樣不要理會，他會一人踱去踱個不停，甚至要踱上半天，如果太長久了，我彝要阻止他，他便立刻停止。他也會發脾氣，不過總是為了較大的事情足以使任何人發脾氣的原因才會。他並不是個急躁的人，決不會為了一點小事而使性，事實—他發脾氣的時候眞是非常少。</p>
<p>體貼　「有一件事他會不愉快，那就是叫他等候着我慢吞吞梳裝打扮，赴一個宴會。他覺得女子們叫男子等候他們化裝，實在沒有理由，他說，女子們費去許多時候把自己打扮得美麗，當然是們的權利，別人不能干涉，只是她應該注意時刻，事先就要提早預備才對。不該臨時叫人等候的。</p>
<p>家務　「家中的一切他須絕對作主，一個家庭當然應該如此。他確實代替了我的家務，僱用或停歇僕人完全由他掌管。家裏舉行什麽宴會，他就調排酒食，和我一同商討節目。家用帳目也由他料理，他喜歡把一切整理得井井有條。</p>
<p>游樂　「他並不輕易交朋友，但你如果和他結交了的話，他就成了你的終身好友，即使你犯了重大罪過，他還是不會和你斷絕的。雖然他自己不怎樣喜歡深夜的逛游樂塲所，但是他知道我有時喜歡去玩玩，他就伴我同去，並盡可能的使我玩得開心暢快。</p>
<p>服務　「當然，他不反對我的工作。因為家中事務很少，他也感到我閒在家裏沒事，倒不如外面有工作的好。但是等我們有了孩子，他就不再准許我出外工作了。他淸楚地解釋到那時我應該完全屬於家庭，執行主婦的責任。」</p>
<p>從她的話中可以看出，他們二人是怎樣地相愛着。共同享受閒房之樂，過着一種興趣而愉快的生活，沒有爭吵，只有那光明的可羨的幸福，的確他們眞算是天作之合了。</p>

<p>銀壇春秋</p>
<h3>金星退出大同　加入美成合作　國華拉攏民華　爭取金城片子</h3>
<p>— 貝士</p>
<p>戰後的銀壇，除了去年競攝民間電影，以致鬧出雙包案的笑話外，大家向來採取門羅主義，毫無什麽風浪的。然而，在最近的一星期來，若干電影業巨頭，却都以政治的手段，在彼此間互相門爭了。這里，出面的公司，計有金星，國華，民華，大同，美成，出塲的人物，則有周劍雲，柳口浩，顏鶴鳴，金信民等等，內幕錯綜複雜，眞是偵得一記的一頁銀壇春秋！</p>
<p>這里，記者站在客觀的立塲，作消息的報道：</p>
<p>首先，金星公司創辦的時候，攝影塲是向大同租借的，不過大同的攝影棚，F却是國華公司主人柳中浩出資建造，所以金星與大同的租借合同到六月十五日滿期後，柳中浩表示收回自用，不預備再租給金星攝片了。金星負責人周劍雲，雖與大同也有密切的關係，却也毫無辦法，表示接受，一面趕拍「雨夜槍聲」，一面就找尋新攝影棚了。</p>
<p>恰巧這時，金星內部發生糾紛，曾萬舖等六股東宣吿始退出，當然，這是一個嚴重的問題。因此，柳口浩就與周劍雲商量，願意收買曾等的股票，不過要求一半以上，如此，金星就也可在柳口浩的操縱之下了，繼續在大同的攝片問題，當然跟着可以解決，然而周劍雲加以拒絕了。</p>
<p>這樣，金星的新股東，却由盛不華完全認下，盛是上海目前巨商，聲勢立刻浩大，而攝影塲的問題，就去與美成的顏鶴鳴接洽了，經過數次的談判，全部問題解決，金星自八月一日起，加入美成合作，不過在金星是被迫而成的，但因金星急需要解決攝影棚問題，就只得加以接受。</p>
<p>金星退出大同攝影塲後，無形口，與國華間發生了摩擦，以後的出品，當然不會再放在金城公映了，而且盛丕華又是新華大戲院的大股東，今後的金星片子，毫無疑義地，是由新華獲得的。因此，柳口浩國華即使多出片子，但無論如何不能在金城金都兩戲院接連公映的，於是，就去訪民華主人金信民，希望金信民以民華的立塲，拒絕金星在八月間加入（民華是與美成經常合作的）然而，金信民感到民華的職演員極少，遲兩個月拍片無關緊要，而金星却不相同了，所以並不答應，柳口浩的第一個計劃沒有成功後，就又與金信民商量，希望合作，他的目的，無非金城金都將來鬧起片子恐慌時，如能與民華合作，那麽，民華的出品，就可在金城金都公映了，這柳中浩第二個的策略，是否如願，金信民尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>綜觀以上局勢，門爭的空氣實在非常濃厚，今後發展，尚待事實的證明。</p>

<h3>Konoe Fumimaro Resumes as "Matchmaker" - Formation of New Japanese Cabinet - Teijiro Toyoda Succeeds Matsuoka as Foreign Minister - Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Oikawa Remain in Office</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - The new Japanese cabinet was fully formed this afternoon, just 24 hours after Konoe was ordered to form a cabinet. Navy Admiral Teijiro Toyoda, who served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the second Konoe cabinet, has been appointed Foreign Minister to succeed Matsuoka. Other noteworthy appointments include former Justice Minister Yanagawa being appointed Minister without Portfolio, and former Minister without Portfolio Ogura being appointed Finance Minister. Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Oikawa will both remain in their positions. The full list of the new cabinet is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Justice Minister: Konoe Fumimaro; Foreign Minister and Colonial Minister: Navy Admiral Toyoda Teijiro; Interior Minister: Tanabe Harumichi; Finance Minister: Ogura Masatsune; Army Minister: Lieutenant General Tojo Hideki (reappointed); Navy Minister: Navy Admiral Oikawa Koshiro (reappointed); Education Minister: Hashida Kunihiko; Agriculture and Forestry Minister: Ino Takuyo; Minister of Commerce and Industry: Navy Lieutenant General Sakonji Seizo (former president of the North Sakhalin Oil Production Company); Minister of Railways and Communications: Murata Shozo; Welfare Minister: Lieutenant General Koizumi Chikahiko; Minister without Portfolio: Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke (former Justice Minister), Lieutenant General Suzuki Teiichi.</p>
<p>Former Interior Minister Hiranuma Kiichiro has also been decided to be appointed as Minister without Portfolio. Cabinet Planning Board President Lieutenant General Suzuki will continue to concurrently serve as Cabinet Secretary-General Tomita Kenji, Legislation Bureau Director-General Murase Naoyasu, and Information Bureau Director Ito Suetsugu will also remain in their original positions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (United Press) - After 48 hours, the Emperor personally presided over the inauguration ceremony for the new cabinet members selected by Prime Minister Konoe at 8:50 PM this afternoon in the Phoenix Hall of the Imperial Palace. The Emperor approved the list of new cabinet members submitted by Konoe at 7:00 PM this afternoon and rejected the resignations of the former cabinet members who were not selected for the third Konoe cabinet. The new cabinet formed by Konoe is more streamlined, with a total of only fourteen members, compared to sixteen in the previous cabinet. Fourteen former cabinet members remain, eleven of whom hold cabinet positions. A notable feature of the new cabinet is the presence of three Ministers without Portfolio, compared to only one in the previous cabinet. The new Foreign Minister Toyoda is a key member of the Mitsubishi company and the son-in-law of Navy Lieutenant General Takeda. He previously served as a naval attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the UK. He is from Wakayama Prefecture, the same hometown as Ambassador to the US Nomura.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Konoe began the process of forming the new cabinet at his official residence this morning. Informed sources believe that a draft list could be completed by today afternoon, after which the new cabinet members will be formally appointed by the Emperor in the palace. At 1:10 AM this morning, Konoe invited outgoing Commerce Minister Toyoda to his official residence for a meeting, which concluded at 11:45 AM. Konoe also invited Sakonji, the president of the North Sakhalin Oil Company, to a meeting at 10:10 AM, who then left the Prime Minister's residence. At 11:35 AM, he visited outgoing Navy Minister Oikawa, who then returned to the Prime Minister's residence to report on the discussions to Konoe. Konoe also invited former Finance Minister Tada of the Hiranuma cabinet to a meeting at 12:10 PM this afternoon. Meanwhile, Kaya, the president of the North China Development Company and financial advisor to the Ministry of Finance, visited outgoing Minister without Portfolio Ogura at his private residence for discussions. When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked by reporters this morning whether there would be any changes to Japan's basic policies following the cabinet change, the spokesman replied that he could not add anything beyond the statement released by the Information Bureau regarding Konoe's resignation. Meanwhile, newspapers are speculating about the selection of the new Foreign Minister, as this is seen as the key to forming the new cabinet. Newspapers are emphasizing the need to address the world situation with agility and decisiveness. According to Miyako Shimbun, outgoing Army Minister Tojo sought the opinion of Foreign Ministry diplomatic advisor Saito after consulting with outgoing Navy Minister Oikawa, with the selection of the Foreign Minister being a key topic of discussion. It is also reported that Minister of State Kido discussed the issue with Vice Minister Ohashi. The Prime Minister is currently seeking opinions from all sides and is making every effort to find a satisfactory solution to the issue. According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, diplomatic advisor Saito was very busy last night, first visiting Prime Minister Konoe at 7:20 PM, followed by a visit to former Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka, despite being ill at home, still discussed state affairs with Saito and said that he would visit Konoe today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Financial circles generally believe that Konoe's appointment to form a cabinet indicates that there will be no immediate changes to domestic and foreign policies. Leaders in the financial and business sectors believe that the third Konoe cabinet will seek to intensify state control over oil, coal, and chemicals in order to increase the production of war industries, implement new currency management procedures, and tighten control over food supplies.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Cabinet is "Old Wine in New Bottles" - Basic Policies Unlikely to Change</h3>
<p>Washington, 18th (United Press) - Konoe's reappointment as Prime Minister today indicates that Japanese policies will not be manipulated by extremists in the near future. With Konoe as the head of the government, Japan's policies are likely to be more moderate. Konoe is the only figure in Japanese politics who has criticized the military and still maintained his political life. Konoe has openly stated that he cannot allow the military to rule the entire country. Konoe is not a weak or incompetent person who simply follows the tide. He has great courage and may be the most prominent patriot in Japan today. He has a definite plan and is determined not to waver. Many of the policies implemented by former Foreign Minister Matsuoka were opposed by Konoe. He could have overthrown Matsuoka six months ago, but he feared causing internal turmoil. Now he can clear out the internal elements and promote a new start for Japan. (Note: This dispatch was sent by United Press Tokyo bureau chief Thomson, who resided in Japan for five years and recently returned to Washington.)</p>
<p>New York, 18th (United Press) - The Scripps-Howard newspapers commented yesterday that the recent cabinet reshuffle in Japan would not change Japan's basic policies. Even if the new cabinet is formed by liberals and anti-Axis leaders, their policies and lives will still be in the hands of military dictators. Japanese politicians are merely the front line for the military, and the real power holders are the terrorists. The commentary argued that regardless of Britain's needs in the Atlantic, the United States should maintain a balance of its naval and air power in the Pacific. This measure is more effective than anything else in preventing war in the Far East. The New York Times stated that the two resignations of the Konoe cabinet indicate that the Japanese government is divided from top to bottom and reveal that the political views among Japanese leaders are irreconcilable. The policies decided by the Imperial Conference are based on a complete compromise between the government and the military authorities and will not change. To implement this policy in future emergency situations, the first priority is to form a government that is trusted and obeyed by the entire nation. The reason for the cabinet reshuffle is precisely this. The semi-official organ The Japan Times stated that the future cabinet "will expand the political power of the government with all its strength and complete large-scale economic plans." Asahi Shimbun stated that the selection of the new Foreign Minister will be the main task of Konoe's cabinet reshuffle. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan's basic policies have been set and that it should abandon its passive attitude so that this policy has a proactive and flexible approach to cope with the changing international situation.</p>
<h3>Britain Wishes to Maintain Peace in the Far East</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 28th (Reuters) - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, stated yesterday at the Federal Club here that Hitler may offer peace proposals, but he can assert that they will be rejected regardless of the conditions. Halifax also discussed the situation in the Far East, saying that Britain has decided on a policy, and he believes the US government has as well, which is to do its best to maintain peace in the Pacific. Britain has no intention of fighting with Japan. If Japan is willing to negotiate on various influential issues in the Far East and give due respect to the rights of other related countries, then he truly does not understand why any difficulties should arise that would lead to conflict.</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude is Hesitant and Vacillating, Repeatedly Making Strong Hints</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland, 17th (Havas) - After the resignation of the Japanese Konoe cabinet, the eyes of European countries are focused on Tokyo, and they are speculating on the meaning of this cabinet reshuffle. The Basler Nachrichten stated that in Berlin, the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was</p>
<h3>Main Reason for Cabinet Reshuffle is to Strengthen Political Institutions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Havas)</p>
<p>Political figures here generally believe that the third Konoe cabinet will be a true wartime cabinet, that is, to strengthen the organization to cope with any eventuality. The main purposes of this cabinet reshuffle are two: First, to give the government greater freedom in diplomacy to implement the national policy decided by the Imperial Conference on July 2nd; Second, to grant the government broad powers to control national life, especially economic and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Havas World News Agency) - Newspapers here are commenting on the cabinet reshuffle, focusing on internal affairs, and say on July 2nd. The Züricher Tagesanzeiger stated that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Japan has never indicated that it would act in concert with Germany. The German government has already understood this. In fact, Japan has remained silent for a month, which is clear evidence of the seriousness of the problems Japan is currently encountering. Regarding Italy, according to a dispatch from the Swiss Telegraphic Agency, the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia believes that Japan must explain its attitude at this time because the possibility of the United States entering the war is increasing daily. "At a time when the great powers are about to enter the war, it is difficult for Japan to stay out of it." However, it is still difficult to believe that Japan's basic policies will change course. The Journal de Genève reported that its Rome correspondent said that because the United States may enter the war, Japan must decide on a path. This path is extremely dangerous for Japan, but it also has great benefits.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th (Haitong Agency) - The Italian government is maintaining silence regarding the resignation of the Japanese Konoe cabinet. Italy does not like to advise on the internal affairs of other countries, especially its close friend Japan. Responsible figures deeply feel that the situation in the Far East has become increasingly serious. Italy is watching the measures Japan intends to take with sympathy. The Italian people firmly believe that Japanese policy will be based on fundamental national interests.</p>

<h3>Implementation of Food Administration</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Ministry of Food, food has also been included in the ranks of administration. In broad terms, policies related to land, agriculture, and water conservancy are all included. However, land is not just about allocation; it also requires utilizing the benefits of the land. Agriculture is not just about cultivating, improving, and pest control; it also requires seizing the right time of the year. Water conservancy is not just about ditches and embankments; it should also take into account forestry policies. Therefore, to solve the problem of food, it is necessary to plan comprehensively and not focus on one aspect. Cooperation in division of labor is necessary to achieve effective results.</p>
<p>In terms of its function, it is nothing more than solving the problem of food for the people. However, to solve the problem of food for the people, seeking sufficiency lies in abundant production. Seeking to make up for deficiencies with surpluses lies in ample storage. Seeking appropriate adjustments lies in smooth transportation. Seeking equitable distribution lies in sales controls. With these four factors in place, the effectiveness of food administration will be evident, yet it may still not be the best solution. Governance lies in the welfare of the entire people, not just focusing on the interests of one class or one type, and considering it capable of promoting benefits and eliminating harm. Too high prices hurt the people, while too low prices hurt the farmers. Li Kui mentioned this more than 2,300 years ago. Therefore, only by leveling production and sales, taking into account both the people and the farmers, can the people not suffer from high prices, and the farmers not suffer from low prices. Everyone will be happily engaged in their work and enjoy its benefits. This is the success of solving the food problem.</p>
<p>China is known as a country based on agriculture, but famines have occurred repeatedly, and disaster relief has never ceased. The system of granaries, although developed early and well-made, is still unable to relieve the urgency of the people's food needs, which has caused doubt among commentators. In fact, in the past two thousand years or so, China has been nominally emphasizing agriculture, but the status of farmers has been low. It has been nominally devaluing merchants, but the status of merchants has been high. This has been the case since the Warring States, Qin, and Han dynasties. At times, there has been consideration for farmers to have their own land, and efforts have been devoted to the system of equal land distribution, up until the Tang dynasty, and there were people making the attempt. However, it was still impossible to solve the problems of land ownership and production for farmers. Firstly, farmers' lives are best suited for stability, but wars occurred frequently, and famines occurred repeatedly. Farmers' production was already weak, and once they were disrupted and displaced, they lost everything. As a result, the trend of seizing land became widespread. Secondly, Chinese farmers are the only producers in China, and they are the ultimate bearers of all burdens. Taxes come from farmers, the profits of merchants accrue to farmers, and high-interest exploitation is on farmers. However, in terms of farmers' production capacity, it is extremely fragile. They entrust everything to fate, attribute floods, droughts, and insect pests to destiny, and blame exploitation and manipulation on people. The benefits that accrue to others are many, while the benefits that they enjoy are few. Therefore, when famine comes, the farmers, who are known for their production, suffer the most. Thirdly, farmers adhere to old farming methods. Although they have good experience, they also lack the ability to adapt and improve. Furthermore, they do not receive education and have few opportunities to absorb new ideas and discard old ones. As a result, their status has become increasingly degraded, and they have become the oppressed in society. Therefore, although dynasties have nominally suppressed commerce and valued agriculture in terms of laws and policies, farmers have ultimately been unable to improve their status. They are limited by knowledge, bound by wealth, and shackled by social forces.</p>
<p>Collecting physical goods has long been the practice under the old agricultural production system in China, the so-called "natural color." Since commercial capital gradually developed, Emperor Dezong of the Tang dynasty changed the collection of taxes to summer and autumn taxes, with the tax rate determined by money and grain. As a result, the use of money and later silver for paying taxes became the dominant method, and the collection of physical goods gradually declined. At the end of the Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, there was a fierce debate over whether to accumulate grain or money. However, the reason why people strongly advocated accumulating money rather than grain at the time was precisely because they recognized that it was difficult to manage grain and easy to use money. Now it seems that we are moving towards the opposite direction, accumulating grain rather than money. This is likely because prices are high, the value of currency is low, and collecting physical goods is more practical than collecting money. From this, it can be seen that accumulating money or grain is not like the monkeys of Old Man Ju who were unable to understand giving chestnuts but is due to changes in the times. However, the collection of physical goods is extremely difficult, and losses are heavy. How can these losses be compensated? If compensation is sought from taxpayers, the old problem of "fire consumption" (originally referring to silver, but grain also has losses, so both are mentioned together) will arise. Will this not be an extra levy? If losses are borne by the government, then the amount of loss is a matter of responsibility for the officials in charge. If they are not enough to cover the costs through embezzlement and graft, then the practice of "kicking the bucket and dripping the tip" will come into play, and abuses will arise from this. Moreover, there are various procedures in the collection process, various loopholes for taxpayers, and the customs and sentiments of people in different regions, all of which must be taken into consideration. What should be particularly noted is that when grain is gathered, the price of grain often becomes expensive due to absorption. When grain is returned, it becomes cheap due to external release. If old grain is returned, it is not clear what the value of the grain will be. If new grain is returned, then the process of taking and giving is still for merchants. Looking at the history of the Ever-Normal Granary, with its pros and cons of releasing old grain and replacing it with new grain, it can serve as a lesson. Food administration is a large-scale undertaking that was previously divided among various departments, making it difficult to coordinate everything and establish a good model. Now that there is a specialized department responsible for construction, it will be able to thoroughly establish a foundation for China's grain production, people's food, military supplies, and storage, and lay the foundation for people's livelihoods. This will not only fulfill the promotion of the food problem by people in society for the past fifteen years, but also provide hope for the realization of the Three Principles of the People and the solution of the problem of eating!</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Examines Japanese Policy: Dominating East Asia is Just a Dream</h3>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - The Times published a long article yesterday examining Japanese policy, entitled "Japan's Dreams and Reality." It first described Japanese foreign policy since the 16th century, tracing the course of its isolationist policies. It argued that the current events in China are clear evidence that Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia is just a dream. When the European War broke out, the Konoe cabinet saw it as an excellent opportunity and decided to lean towards the country it believed would win in order to gain its consent in advance, so that Japan could share in its spoils and remove all obstacles in Japan's path. Matsuoka's new book on Japan's world mission states that the gist of Japan's goals will be understood in about thirty years and will begin to produce results in fifty years. According to non-official but authoritative sources, Japan's goals include all areas within the 180th meridian and the Arabian Sea, including India, Malaya, Australia, and half of the world's population. The form of its future rule can be seen in the structure of Manchukuo, which is nominally independent but actually a Japanese colony, and in the demands of the victorious countries published by the Japan Times, an organ of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: (1) Britain and the United States will change all key points from Gibraltar to Hawaii into small garrison areas; (2) European territories in the Pacific will be granted independent autonomy, with Japanese as their government advisors, so that various forms of cooperation within the Co-Prosperity Sphere can achieve rationalized peace conditions. Although Japanese politicians say that Japan has no territorial ambitions and hates Western imperialism, they also openly state that those who are not sincere or do not understand Japan's true intentions, such as China, will be whipped. The Konoe cabinet fully agreed with the Nazi plan to divide the world into four or five groups: (1) the German-Italian group, which includes all of Europe and Africa; (2) the Soviet group, which includes parts of East Asia and Central Asia; (3) the American group, which includes North and South America; (4) the British Empire group, but only if Britain agrees to a negotiated peace; (5) the Greater East Asia group, led by Japan. To achieve its goals, Japan is pouring its new efforts into the war against Chiang Kai-shek and is planning to strengthen the Nanjing regime to promote the peace movement. It is also sending troops to Vietnam to force a mediation of the land dispute between Thailand and Vietnam and is concluding a commercial treaty that will allow Japan to exploit Vietnam's resources. However, this policy of Japan has encountered two setbacks: one is the continued resistance of Chiang Kai-shek, and the other is the attitude of the Dutch East Indies. Japan is no stranger to suspicion and its machinations, which are due to the aid of the United States. Japanese newspapers are also vigorously denouncing the Dutch East Indies government, referring to it as a puppet of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan has reached the point where it must first resolve its issues with Britain and the United States before it can proceed with its plans or escape its predicament in China. However, although Japan has made various proposals in this regard, it has not been able to achieve its wishes. The Konoe cabinet has not given up its policies and can only maintain its belief that Britain and the United States will eventually fail. Japanese newspapers are loudly proclaiming that the failure of Britain and the United States is inevitable, but most Japanese people do not believe this and are gradually feeling that Japan is on the wrong path. More conservative Japanese politicians who are unwilling to take adventurous actions, and merchants who know that Japan's prosperity depends heavily on foreign trade (before the war, Japan's trade with democracies accounted for 70% of the total), do not see the need for Japan to offend Britain and the United States. It is noteworthy that the idea of Japan assisting Germany and Italy in the war has been denounced as the work of Germany's fifth column. However, the goal of Japan's national policy is supported by the entire country, which is undeniable. Therefore, the only question now is whether the path taken by the government is appropriate. Japanese people want to see their country replace the rights of white people such as Britain and the United States in East Asia, but they do not want to pay the price of harming the country. Japanese people are realistic. Although the military rebellion of February 26, 1936, was suppressed, its latent ideology is still the basis of the new institutions. However, Japan's totalitarian system is hindered by three factors: one is the Diet, which, although said to be weak, still showed its expected strength in the last session; two is the conservative faction, led by Interior Minister Hiranuma; three is the higher-ranking army leaders, who have discovered through bitter experience that the control of industry by soldiers and bureaucrats not only does not increase its efficiency but also greatly reduces production. Therefore, the cabinet is organized jointly by soldiers and people from the business community who are engaged in the economic war led by Ogura. This is the general situation of the current Japanese cabinet.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Reaffirms Maintaining Friendship with Japan - Denies Ceding Pacific Base - Fisheries and Trade Negotiations are in Progress</h3>
<p>Moscow, 18th (United Press) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky told reporters yesterday that the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its friendly relations with Japan since the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, and that Stalin and Konoe have fully understood this statement. Lozovsky also denied reports that the Soviet Union was negotiating with the United States to cede border areas in the Pacific as a base, saying that this report was a wartime newspaper rumor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Reuters) - Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin visited Vice Minister Ohashi at 10:00 AM today for an hour. When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii was asked by reporters this morning about the Soviet Union establishing a dangerous area in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk, the spokesman replied that he did not know whether the Japanese government had protested to the Soviet government. Regarding the Japanese-Soviet fisheries and other negotiations, the spokesman said that these negotiations are still in progress. When asked about reports that Britain, the United States, and the Chongqing government were jointly purchasing raw materials in Vietnam and Thailand, and what Japan's reaction would be, the spokesman replied that this would depend on the amount purchased, but that there was no official information to verify this report.</p>
<h3>Japan Exerts Pressure on Vietnam - Hoping to Obtain Base</h3>
<p>London, 18th (United Press) - Neutral sources in contact with the Vichy government today expressed interest in confirming reports that Japan is continuing to exert significant pressure on Pétain to hand over Cam Ranh Bay to Japan, otherwise Japan will seize this military seaport by force. Other diplomatic sources have also received similar reports to those published by the London Times' foreign affairs correspondent yesterday, that Japan threatened to attack Vietnam in order to obtain this base. One diplomatic source said that Tokyo only gave Pétain a certain amount of time to decide whether to yield or fight. This source pointed out that Japan has a large number of air forces in Vietnam as a backing for its negotiations. Previously, about 130 Japanese aircraft were based in Hanoi and Haiphong, and this number has recently increased. It is reported that there are 300 aircraft stationed on Hainan Island, 180 on the Spratly Islands, and 300 in Taiwan. It is generally expected that after making new demands, Japan may adopt a more radical policy than it has recently taken towards Vietnam. Although Japanese leaders have been influenced by industrial leaders and conservative leaders, there are still those who believe that Japan can obtain favorable concessions from Vietnam without causing effective intervention or opposition from Britain and the United States. According to interpretations here, Japan's opinion is that this procedure will ensure that Japan obtains new sources of food and raw materials, which are useful bases. At the same time, it can also convince Hitler that Japan is cooperating diligently with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Vichy, 18th (Havas) - Regarding French-Japanese relations, there have been many rumors lately. Informed sources here recently stated that in terms of diplomacy, there are currently no signs that French-Japanese relations have changed. Japanese Ambassador Kato's visit to Assistant Darlan yesterday was not a negotiation and did not introduce any new factors into this relationship.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Various Parts of China Have Recently Begun to Withdraw; Only a Small Number of Troops Remain to Guard Strongholds; Japanese Troops in China Will Not Launch a Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>Chongqing The attention of the Chinese side is still focused on the changing tides in Japan, but so far, all predictions about future developments are based entirely on speculation, because the current strict censorship of news in Japan makes it difficult to obtain concrete information. At the same time, according to reports received by reliable Chinese sources here, it is suggested that Japanese troops in various parts of China have recently been withdrawing. However, Chinese sources have emphasized that this withdrawal does not necessarily mean that the Japanese intend to abandon any important cities they occupy in China. On the contrary, judging from the strong defensive works built by the Japanese army in various important cities, it can be seen that they intend to hold them. The only conclusion that can be drawn at present is that Japan, at least for the time being, does not plan to launch any large-scale offensive in China. After building strong defensive works, Japan will be able to withdraw most of its troops and only station troops sufficient to guard these strongholds. The general opinion is that the possibility of a Japanese attack on Chongqing has been eliminated, or at least it will be difficult to achieve before next summer, because the preparation for such a large-scale military operation will take some time. There is also news that Japan's mobilization is currently underway, and four divisions have completed mobilization. As for whether the troops withdrawn from China and those mobilized in Japan are intended for a northern offensive or a southern advance, it is still impossible to determine.

<h3>Twenty-Seven Japanese Aircraft Raided Chongqing Yesterday; The Most Damaged Was the Press Association; A Bomb Also Landed on the Residence of the British Embassy</h3>
<p>Chongqing Chongqing was bombed for the twentieth time this year. The bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft were heavier than usual. One of them landed on top of the air raid shelter of the British Embassy's hilltop residence. The ambassador and his staff were shaken, but no one was injured. A total of 27 Japanese aircraft flew over Chongqing at 1:00 p.m., forming a long and uneven line, bombing the western district. The most damaged was the Press Association. It is believed that there were few casualties in the densely populated residential area between the city headquarters. No foreign property was damaged, but the former French Embassy, which had been hit many times this year, was damaged again this time. One of the first bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft landed on the roof of the basement where British Ambassador Kerr and his staff were living. Although they suffered an unusual shock, no one was injured. The British Ambassador's residence was also slightly shaken and not damaged.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases One Week of Battle Situation (July 11th to 17th)</h3>
<p>Chongqing The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission discussed the battle situation for the week from July 11th to 17th. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Japanese, although worried and depressed, are still actively preparing and seizing opportunities. Therefore, this week, there were only minor disturbances in eastern Guangdong and northern Jiangxi. A brief account is given below:</p>
<p>Eastern Guangdong The Japanese army in Huanggang City (east of Chao'an), as we reported last week, one unit invaded Qiandong to the west and had reached north of Zhanglin. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, more than 1,000 reinforcements suddenly invaded the north of Dengtawei and advanced towards Fushanwei. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until the morning of the 9th. The Japanese army, having suffered losses, retreated towards Huanggang City. Then, the Chinese army, together with the troops that had captured Shangxincun from Fenshuiguan, attacked Huanggang City. By the evening of the 11th, the Japanese army was unable to resist and abandoned the city, retreating towards the coast. The Chinese army then recaptured Huanggang City and continued to clear the area towards the coast. At present, there is no trace of the Japanese army in Huanggang City and the area to the east. In this battle, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi The Japanese army invaded the mountainous area in several routes. (1) On the evening of the 6th, a part of the Japanese army from Hege to Henglieshan'ao, west of Ruichang, confronted the Chinese army. (2) On the same evening, the Japanese army, advancing from Wangjiapu, southwest of Ruichang, in the Beiyashan Lukeng Zhang area, was met by the Chinese army and retreated after suffering losses on the evening of the 7th. (3) The Japanese army, invading Tianqiaohe Xiajiaqiao and other places northeast of Wudu, joined forces on the morning of the 8th to invade Xinxiyuan, north of Wuning. After being met by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xixi from Tianqiaohe. One unit from Xiajiaqiao is still fighting the Chinese army at Meixiushan. (4) More than 1,000 Japanese troops in the area north of Anyi invaded Shixia Yu, northeast of Jing'an, on the night of the 10th. After being met by the Chinese army, many Japanese were killed. On the morning of the next day, the Japanese reinforced and invaded Tangping Wang. By noon, the Chinese army had completely defeated the Japanese army and seized Tangping Wang Shixia Yu and other strongholds in succession. The Japanese army retreated along the original route and has now restored its original state.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese army in Daye, southern Hubei, invaded Damushan on the 8th and was encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Qingyang Yinjiahui invaded Dawangmiao Dalangshan on the 7th and was repelled. The Japanese army in Chaoxian invaded Zhaoguan on the 8th and also suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army in Zhangdian, Jinpu, invaded Dalangmiao on the 7th and more than 100 Japanese soldiers below the rank of major were killed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army has been sporadically active everywhere, and the Chinese army cannot but launch small-scale attacks. (1) On the evening of the 7th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Wanshe Street She Dian Wei and other places south of Nanchang, destroying three layers of barbed wire and seizing many rifles and military supplies. (2) On the evening of the 8th, a certain Chinese unit attacked the Japanese army in Xiao'ao, southwest of Ruichang. The Chinese artillery fired to assist in the battle. By the next morning, many Japanese soldiers had been killed and wounded, and the roads and bridges from Xiao'ao to Tianjiazhuang had been completely destroyed. (3) On the 6th and 7th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Emeiling, Yepingfan, southwest of Chongyang, and captured many spoils. At the same time, another Chinese unit completely destroyed the transportation between Dashaping, north of Dizhoufan, and Laokoushi. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>

<h3>Xu Mo Appointed Envoy to Australia</h3>
<p>The Republic of China and the Commonwealth of Australia have decided to exchange envoys. The Australian side has been announced by Foreign Minister Stewart, and China also announced on May 14 that, in view of the current situation in the Pacific, China and Australia urgently need to send envoys to each other. After two months of selecting candidates for the first envoy, the Australian side has decided to send Eggerston as the first ambassador to China, and China is also expected to appoint Xu Mo, who has served as the Foreign Minister for many years. This marks the opening of a new era in the diplomatic history of China and Australia. Especially given Australia's current important position in the Pacific, the exchange of envoys is a very noteworthy event.</p>
<p>A former middle school teacher and journalist</p>
<p>Xu Mo, courtesy name Shumo, is a native of Wuxian. He is a man of outstanding talent, profound knowledge, and an outstanding talent in the diplomatic world. He graduated from the Law Department of Peking University in his early years, stayed in the United States, and obtained a Master of Laws and Politics. He was the first in the most outstanding class of the diplomatic official examination in the eighth year of the Republic of China. He worked as a teacher at Jiangsu No. 8 Middle School, and also served as a journalist. He worked as a judge and chief judge of the criminal court in the Shanghai Provisional Court. Later, he served as a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director of the European and American Department, and Jiangsu Negotiator. He is currently the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He speaks fluent Wu dialect, is short in stature, and is a small and capable figure in the diplomatic world. He, Xu Shiying, and Jiang Tingfu are three giants. He has always been very silent, but has a very strong memory. He can recite almost all kinds of diplomatic treaties, which is one of his genius characteristics.</p>
<p>An important part of the Pacific situation</p>
<p>Speaking of Australia, it occupies an extremely important part in today's Pacific situation. It sends expeditionary forces, manufactures aircraft for Britain, and its help to Britain in terms of manpower and material resources is very great. Its prosperity in agriculture and animal husbandry and its wealth of reserves will surely make it an important economic country in the world in the future. It has a population of more than 7 million, and its arms production exceeds India and far exceeds Canada. Its annual gold production is worth 11.1 million pounds, and its silver production is worth 5 million pounds. The annual value of factory production is 41.4 million pounds. Wool production ranks first in the world.</p>
<p>Striving for democracy and eternal friendship between the two countries</p>
<p>Although the relationship between Australia and China has been friendly in the past, it has not been close. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Australian Federal Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Lanshan led an inspection group to China to meet with the Chinese authorities. After returning to China, Lan appointed Boden as the Australian Commercial Commissioner to China, stationed in Shanghai. In the autumn, 60 Australian girl scouts came to China for sightseeing, and diplomatic relations gradually increased. Until this year, Guo Taiqi, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, negotiated with Britain and Australia. China and Australia both felt the need to send envoys to each other as soon as possible, and they have recently selected candidates. In the near future, China and Australia will not only enhance the friendship between the two countries, but also make a brilliant contribution to the world.</p>

<h3>Major Battles Erupt Between Soviet and German Forces on Four Main Lines; Soviet Counterattack at Smolensk is Successful; German Forces in the North Advance Towards Leningrad</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th The German offensive on the Eastern Front appears to have developed into a four-pronged major attack, with fierce fighting continuing in all areas. The first route is towards Leningrad. Regarding the war in this area, the Moscow Gazette claims that a major battle is underway in the area south of Lake Peipus, about 150 miles from Leningrad. It also said that Moscow Radio announced that the enemy had encountered extremely fierce resistance in this area, because a large number of civilians had joined the guerrillas, destroying railways, destroying German tanks, and disrupting their rear. In the central area, the German forces are trying to break through to Smolensk. The fighting seems to be still fierce. News from the Kiev front said that the German offensive towards Ukraine had been contained a few days ago. There is still fighting in the Novgorod to Volynsk area. As for the major battle currently underway in Bessarabia, there is very little news. The German forces in that area seem to have made slight progress. According to the Soviet military bulletin issued last night, on the evening of July 17, fierce fighting continued in the areas of Pskov, Smolensk, Bobruisk, and Bessarabia. There was little change in the positions of the two armies on the front line. The Soviet Air Force continued to attack the enemy's mechanized units and bombed enemy aircraft at various airports. According to preliminary reports, the German side lost a total of 22 aircraft, and the Soviet side also lost 8 aircraft. At the same time, the German High Command bulletin stated that a major battle was underway on the Eastern Front and that our side had gained an advantage.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 17th According to news received here, the armies of Germany and the Soviet Union are continuing to fight fiercely along a 2,000-mile front. The battle for Leningrad and Moscow has gradually entered a critical stage. The general situation on each battlefield is as follows: (1) The battle for Leningrad is inherently complementary to the battle for Moscow. The war on both sides is becoming increasingly fierce. However, judging from the current situation, Leningrad may fall. Finnish troops are intensifying their encirclement from the north of the city, but are not attacking for the time being, waiting until the German troops approach from the south before launching an attack, in order to coordinate with each other. The vanguard of the German army has occupied the town of Loga in Estonia, about 60 miles south of Leningrad. Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, is in great danger. The Red Army in that area has been surrounded, but the Red Army in the Pskov region is still fighting bravely. (2) Regarding the battle for Moscow, according to Soviet war reports, fierce fighting is taking place between the two sides in the Smolensk region, which is only 170 miles from Moscow, and its importance is evident. Although the counterattack launched by the Red Army in the southern section of the line has been very successful, the German troops are advancing section by section in the northern section. The Red Army must make a strategic retreat immediately to avoid being surrounded. Generally, the Red Army will use the Dnieper River as the final defense line, in order to use the natural barrier to contain the German advance. (3) The battle for Ukraine takes Kiev, the capital of the state, as the main target. The German advance is very slow. Fierce fighting has been going on for ten days in the Novgorod-Volynsk region, and the German troops have not achieved anything. However, the Red Army commander has decided to abandon Kiev, so the fall of the city is imminent. (4) The German troops in the Bessarabia region have not been very active. Soon, they will join forces with the Hungarian and Slovak troops to launch an attack. After the fall of Chisinau, the capital of Bessarabia province, the German troops have built many bridgeheads on the Prut River in order to spy on the Dniester River.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 18th According to the German military department, since the Stalin Line was broken, the war on the entire front is proceeding fiercely. Although the Soviet resistance is fierce, the German troops are making progress everywhere. It is reported that the last batch of Soviet reserve troops has been sent to the front. At present, there are about 9 million troops on both sides, which is more than the Western Front campaign last year. It can be said that it is unprecedented in history. The length of the front is also unprecedented. The decisive battle that follows will determine the fate of Europe for centuries to come.</p>
<p>Havas, a certain place on the Soviet border, 17th Twenty-six days have passed since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Since the German troops broke through the Stalin Line, the city of Smolensk has been in imminent danger. It has now been occupied by the German troops, which is a major turning point in the German-Soviet war. According to historical facts, after Napoleon I's army occupied the city of Smolensk, it went straight to Moscow. Therefore, the general public is asking whether the German occupation of the city marks the successful conclusion of the German offensive. According to a German military spokesman today, there will be major developments soon. Berlin is also rumored that the German troops entered the suburbs of Kiev this afternoon, and street fighting has broken out there. Whether this statement is true or not is debatable, but it can be concluded that after the German troops broke through the Stalin Line, the Soviet Union's second line of defense suffered a major blow.</p>
<h3>German Forces Use Artificial Fog to Advance Towards the Kiev Fortress</h3>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 18th The German war machine is advancing eastward under artificial fog in "the greatest struggle in world history." Yesterday, it was heard that it had occupied Smolensk and Chisinau, the three chief towns of Bessarabia, which is the last major line of defense for Kiev.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 17th The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after the Red Army in the Kiev region was defeated by the German troops, it repeatedly used armored vehicle units to cover a large-scale counterattack, attempting to prevent the German advance. The German troops in the central route continued to advance. After a fierce battle in the Orsha area, the German troops expanded their stronghold on the other side of the Dnieper River. The Red Army was forced to retreat and transferred reserve troops to the front. However, the German artillery constantly bombarded the Soviet positions and covered the infantry to advance forward.</p>
<h3>Germany Determined to Win or Lose: Outcome Uncertain</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - As the threat to Leningrad reaches a critical stage, military experts here believe that the Germans are now using all their national strength in a "win or lose" struggle, attempting to defeat Soviet resistance and capture Leningrad and Moscow. The German high command, aware that the Soviet Union continues to make an orderly retreat eastward, destroying transportation and storage facilities along the way, making it impossible for the German army to advance, has exhausted all efforts to prepare for defeating the Soviet army. This German strategy must be carefully executed to maintain the need for a large amount of military supplies and requires great courage and determination. Although the German rear is restricted by transportation difficulties, it is generally believed that the German army can advance with the air force and armored divisions from the German border to the front lines. This is because the current Nazi plan is to use the power of the air force and armored divisions to attack. However, it is difficult for the German army to sustain such a massive operation for long. Experts believe that the outcome of this German tactic will soon be evident. Some experts also believe that if the German army fails to capture Leningrad and Moscow within three weeks, it will definitely fail. The German army is now trying to gain more strongholds in the south, so that it can control the railways and highways leading to Leningrad from the south and southeast, preparing for a direct attack. This German advance from the south may take place simultaneously with another army's advance across the Karelian Isthmus from the north. If the German army adopts a pincer attack strategy, Leningrad will be in extreme danger. However, it is generally expected that the Soviet army will put up fierce resistance at that time, and it is reported that Leningrad now has one million well-equipped Soviet troops. If the German claim of occupying Polotsk and Smolensk is true, then the area between these two places, Vitebsk, will probably also fall into German hands. The area between Vitebsk and Smolensk, the Dvina and Dnieper River section (gap), is the weakest part of the Soviet northern defense line, on the road to Moscow. If this triangular area is lost, then the Soviet railway line from north to south, in other words, the very long railway line from Leningrad via Vitebsk to Smolensk, and then from there to Kiev and Odessa, will also be lost.</p>
<h3>German and Finnish Forces Jointly Attack the Far Northern Front: Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 17th</p>
<p>"Dagens Nyheter" reported that the joint German-Finnish forces under the command of German General Falkenhorst have penetrated into the Soviet territory of the Salla region on the far northern front and fierce fighting has already broken out. The Allied forces are attacking the cities of Kandalaksha and Kumo, and it is not yet known how far they have advanced. It is only known that they have not yet reached the railway from Leningrad to Murmansk, which has been bombed by the German Air Force, disrupting traffic. In addition, the Finnish army has begun an offensive on the Ladoga Lake front, attempting to cut off traffic in the Trokscha-Votersk district to contain the main force of the Red Army until the German army arrives near Leningrad.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 17th - The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the terrain of the Kola Peninsula is rugged and uneven, and the German army's progress is very slow. In addition, transportation is inconvenient, and it is extremely difficult to send reinforcements. Wounded soldiers on the front lines are being transported back by seaplane.</p>
<p>Havas, Helsinki, 17th - The Finnish Intelligence Bureau issued a battle report stating, "Our air force has assisted the army in combat, with great success. It has bombed enemy railway cars, armored trains, troops, and motorcades, and strafed the ground with machine guns. Soviet railway equipment has been destroyed, causing trains to stop, and troops have dispersed in all directions, while motorcades have caught fire and burned. Our aircraft have also been very successful in bombing Soviet artillery positions. The railway to Murmansk has also been bombed by our aircraft, with heavy losses, especially in the areas of Lolanmberto and Petroskaya."</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Appears to Hold the Advantage: Active Partisan Warfare Behind the Lines</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 18th - Soviet Air Force Captain Gruzden wrote an article published in "Red Star" stating that Hitler has sent his best aircraft to participate in the Eastern Front campaign. However, the Soviet Air Force still holds the advantage in aerial combat. Soviet pilots are determined to destroy enemy aircraft whenever they encounter them, and will not allow them to escape. When German vanguard aircraft come into contact with Soviet fighters, they immediately flee. In order to encourage German pilots to fight to the death, the German command does not allow them to carry parachutes. However, even with large numbers, German aircraft may not gain any advantage.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Moscow experts highly praised the Soviet fighter planes, saying that most of them are superior to the German Messerschmitt fighters, and the Soviet dive bombers are also quite good. The Germans have failed to gain permanent air superiority in any location, while the Soviet Air Force is always able to operate behind the lines, bombing rear traffic and transportation. The so-called guerrillas can be divided into two types: (1) large units of Soviet soldiers closely coordinated behind the main lines to cut off the supply of enemy tanks; (2) small units of Soviet soldiers operating far behind enemy lines, causing great trouble. It is not clear how these Soviet soldiers left in the retreat zone find food, as all food in the retreat zone has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 18th - This evening, a radio station here broadcast a message stating that Soviet guerrillas in the German-occupied areas are becoming more active. In the Smelensk region, seven enemy tanks and many trucks have been destroyed. Enemy supply lines, railways, and telephone communications are also frequently disrupted.</p>
<h3>Moscow: People Remain Calm and Confident of Victory</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - A Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that the people of Moscow, upon hearing the news of the German advance, are not only not discouraged but also more determined than a week ago, believing that the eventual defeat of the German army after suffering setbacks is absolutely inevitable. This belief stems from the slow pace of the German advance and the impact of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The situation in Moscow and the tone of Soviet propaganda both reflect this belief. Daily life in Moscow seems more normal than a week ago, with crowded theaters and cinemas, and riverside parks, restaurants, theatrical performances, and exhibitions all teeming with visitors.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Czech Agreement Signed in London</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - According to "Soviet War News," a Soviet-Czech agreement was signed today at the Soviet embassy here, agreeing that the two governments will exchange diplomatic representatives and jointly fight against Germany under Hitler's rule. The agreement is written in both Russian and Czech. The signatories were the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, and the Czech Foreign Minister, Masaryk.</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister Expresses Friendship to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - The Greek Embassy in London recently released a statement by Greek Prime Minister Tsouderos upon his arrival in South Africa, stating that Greece has declared friendship and solidarity with the Soviet Union. Greece continues to fight for freedom and is not concerned about its views on the "current development and changes of socialist parties." Greece will do everything in its power to provide the Soviet Union with all kinds of assistance in this war against a common enemy.</p>
<h3>Hopkins Arrives in England to Discuss Aid to Britain; US Aircraft and Military Production Are Rapidly Increasing; Combined Efforts of Two Countries Will Overthrow Fascism</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins, who is now in London, told visiting reporters today that he will stay in England for a week or ten days to discuss the entire issue of supplies to Britain and the Middle East with the British government and the US Ambassador, Winant. The production of US war equipment, especially aircraft and tanks, has increased rapidly. The United States is now undertaking the largest merchant ship construction program ever undertaken by any country, so that there will be sufficient ships to transport these goods to every country in the world fighting for democracy. The United States plans to complete one million tons of merchant ships this year, six million tons next year, and even more in 1943. Regarding munitions, we have embarked on a large aircraft production program, which is now progressing rapidly. Many new factories, especially those manufacturing four-engine heavy bombers, will soon be producing aircraft. These heavy bombers can fly to the easternmost parts of Germany and destroy its factories and sources of supply. We are confident that the number of these aircraft built in the United Kingdom and the United States will far exceed that of Germany, and their quality will also exceed that of Germany. The United States has also greatly increased the production of tanks and anti-tank guns. In short, US output is increasing daily and will expand to unimaginable levels in the future. The total production efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States must ensure that the supply of armaments is sufficient to overthrow the fascist dictators. Its sole purpose is to whip the blind followers. When a reporter asked whether the United States would protect its goods being transported across the Atlantic, Hopkins replied that President Roosevelt had stated that US goods would arrive safely. All he can say at present is that we will comply with this and we will protect these ships, but he cannot discuss the details.</p>
<h3>Turkey Denies Territorial Disputes with Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Havas, Ankara, 18th - A radio station here recently broadcast a message denying rumors of territorial disputes between Turkey and Bulgaria, and stating that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty is still in effect, and the two countries are determined to maintain friendly relations.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Active Over French Territory</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - The British Air Ministry announced that yesterday, British fighter planes were active in the skies over northern France and the Channel. Two German fighters were shot down in the skies over northern France, and three German fighters were shot down over the Channel. Two British aircraft are also missing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 18th - Berlin officials announced last night that yesterday afternoon, British aircraft, covered by a large number of fighter planes, attempted to intrude into French territory. They were attacked by German fighter planes. In addition to one British Blenheim aircraft being shot down by anti-aircraft guns, three Spitfire aircraft were shot down in aerial combat.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - Officials announced that on Wednesday night, British coastal aircraft attacked enemy ships. An enemy 6,000-ton oil tanker and a 3,500-ton supply ship are believed to have been sunk. Two other supply ships may also have been damaged.</p>
<h3>Prominent Bulgarian Figures to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 18th - Officials announced today that Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov will arrive here on July 21 for an official visit and will meet with Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<h3>New Cuban Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Reuters, Havana, 18th - Cuban President Batista formed a new cabinet yesterday, retaining some old cabinet members, some of whom have been appointed to new positions. Former Cuban President Laredo Bru has been appointed as the Minister of Justice in the newly formed cabinet.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Intensifies Economic Sanctions Against the Axis Powers: South American Merchants Trading with Germany and Italy Placed on Blacklist and No Longer Supplied with US Goods</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - The United States recently announced the names of 1,800 merchants and firms in Latin America, prohibiting Americans from trading with them, in order to enhance national defense and block channels of export to Germany and Italy. This list was compiled after a long-term investigation by the US Department of State, Treasury, Justice, Commerce, and Export Control Board. It will be added to or subtracted from at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt announced yesterday a "blacklist" of 1,800 Latin American individuals and businesses, prohibiting US businesses from exporting goods to them. This move is clearly an economic blow to the Axis powers. The blacklist is the result of a long-term investigation and includes all businesses suspected of "acting as front-line agents" for totalitarian groups. It is claimed that the purpose of this move is to prevent interference in legitimate Pan-American commerce. The list includes those "acting in the interests of Germany and Italy. If goods are exported to them, it would harm national defense interests. The businesses include German and Italian banks, chemical plants, management offices, arms companies, photographic material companies, public utilities, and airlines."</p>

<h3>White House Convenes Meeting to Discuss the Overall Situation in the Far East: Four Navy Leaders Invited to Participate; Joint Anglo-American Action to Prevent Japanese Advance Southward</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt convened a meeting of key naval advisors on Thursday evening. Those present included Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Rear Admiral King, and Director of Naval Operations Tactical Division Rear Admiral Turner.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - It is generally believed that the overall situation in the Far East was also discussed at the meeting of naval advisors convened by President Roosevelt on Thursday. However, those present refused to disclose any information.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that he could not comment on the overall situation in the Far East because the information he received about developments was very fragmentary. When asked whether US Ambassador to Japan Grew had sent any information, Welles replied that he had received many different messages. When asked whether he could reveal anything about his meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday morning, Welles replied that he had only given the President several pieces of information.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that regarding reports circulating abroad that Japan is now putting pressure on Vichy to give up its base in Vietnam, British officials said today that the same news had been received in Shanghai earlier this month. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, questioned the Japanese authorities about this, and the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs immediately stated firmly that this was incorrect. British officials also said that if Japan disregarded its statement and established bases in Cam Ranh Bay and other places by means of pressure, threats, or military force, this step would bring Japan closer to the territories of other countries. London and Washington are still closely monitoring the situation as before. What the British Commander-in-Chief, Brooke-Popham, told a Reuters reporter in Singapore yesterday shows that the British authorities in the Far East are fully prepared. Regarding the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, no criticism can be made at this time. However, according to news from Tokyo, the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet is aimed at establishing a more powerful government to deal with domestic and international situations. Japan has recently shown signs that are causing the Japanese people to have both expectations and anxieties about the future, such as the closure of Kobe, Japan's second largest port, for ten days, the conscription of reservists, and the movement of troops. All of these things make the claim that Japan is putting pressure on Vichy more credible. Although Germany would rather see Japan cause trouble on the Soviet Union's back door, it cannot at this time help its Vichy puppet and oppose its Far East Axis partner.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 18th - Although observers have expressed the view that Japan will move south to Vietnam within a few weeks, responsible military circles are unwilling to discuss the rumors about Japan's intentions and its southward movements. Since 1931, the cornerstone of Japan's international policy has been nothing more than external expansion. Over the past decade, the trend of expansion has been clearly southward. There is now an excellent opportunity to advance deeply south without a fight, because the Syrian crisis has shown the collapse of French territories, and even if the French want to defend Vietnam, they cannot. Knowledgeable people generally believe that Japan will take Vietnam within a few weeks and seize its military strongholds, such as Cam Ranh Bay, because Japan has the power to do so without causing a conflict with the democratic countries. The change in the Japanese cabinet was probably caused by the militarists who advocated aggression. This is also evidence that Japan is about to take action. In addition, there are other signs, namely, the recent movement of Japanese troops and the requisition of Japanese merchant ships. Japan is now in urgent need of foreign exchange, and would never requisition merchant ships without extremely good reason, causing itself a huge financial loss. Moreover, if it is not transporting many troops, it does not need so many ships. However, Japan is now requisitioning a large number of merchant ships, which shows that it wants to station 100,000 to 125,000 troops in southern Vietnam to guard against Britain and Thailand, and to have a military base as a foundation for future incursions into Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Although an attack on Malaya cannot be realized in the short term, Japan may as well wait. The reason is that Vietnam is quite wide, and can be temporarily included. According to knowledgeable sources, Japan will not gain anything if it attacks Siberia at this time, so it will not advance north. If the Soviet Union is what Germany wants, if the Soviet-German war drags on, then the Soviet Union will inevitably withdraw its Far East garrison to secure its western border, and Japan will be in a better position to attack at that time. From an overall point of view, the date of Japan's southward advance is probably not far away. The main reason is that the democratic countries are willing to fight for France, but if Japan attacks Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, or the Dutch East Indies, it will inevitably cause rapid action on the part of the democratic countries.</p>
<h3>The United States Has Recently Launched Twenty-Two Warships</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 18th - The US Navy Department said that in the four weeks ending July 10, 22 US ships were launched, including one South Dakota-class battleship, two destroyers, one submarine, seven high-speed motor torpedo boats, and several other small warships. Also in these four weeks, the US shipyard began building new ships, almost one every day.</p>
<h3>US Army Chief of Staff Advises the United States to Prepare for War: A Tragic Situation Will Come to the Western Hemisphere; US Congress Should Declare a National Emergency</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - Army Chief of Staff General Marshall told the Senate Military Committee yesterday that the Army now foresees that Spain, Portugal, and Africa will fall into the hands of the Axis powers one after another, and warned that the United States is encountering a "tragic situation" unless the United States is prepared for war. He said that the world today is encountering a "huge military operation." This military operation began in Austria and has now extended to the Soviet Union. This war machine is launched in one place at a time, and other countries that are not affected are hypnotized by treaties and trade agreements. Undoubtedly, if we are not prepared for war, a tragic situation will befall us. We cannot risk our own security. Marshall said that the Army has always adopted a conservative policy, but has always been prepared for tit-for-tat actions against the Hitler government. He said that there are rumors that Germany has 300 army divisions, 20 of which are armored units. He also said that the United States is now providing financial resources to Brazil to expand its air force, so that the Western Hemisphere is under close protection to deal with "a rogue country." He also said that the US sailors who occupied Iceland did so because the US Army lacked officers sufficient for other transfers, and the Army's current recruits and reservists do not have legal permission to be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. General Marshall also said that August 1 is the deadline for Congress to accept or reject the extension of the service period of recruits and the National Guard.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - Army Chief of Staff Marshall also presented his views to the Senate Military Committee, strongly stating the absolute necessity, from a military standpoint, for Congress to declare a state of national emergency so that the one-year term of enlistment for soldiers can be extended. Marshall said, "We only started last year to carry out what we can make people amazed at. We can reach a strong position to protect all our interests. It would be unwise to stop halfway, because from the Army Department's point of view, the current situation is extremely serious, but the Army Department cannot publish its information on recent developments." If the enlistment period is limited to one year, the Army Department will not be able to cope with it comfortably. The Army Department has not yet been able to send a squadron of 24 fighter planes to Iceland to increase the strength of the sailors there. It is absurd to say that he intends to organize an overseas expeditionary force.</p>
<h3>British Public Expresses Goodwill Towards Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - Last night, Soviet Ambassador Maisky went to the Albert Hall concert. After the orchestra played music by famous Russian composers, the ambassador left the hall and was surrounded by the crowd, who cheered unanimously.</p>
<h3>United States Completes Two More Naval Bases: One in Newfoundland and One in Trinidad; Available for Fleet Berthing and Repair</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - The US Navy Department announced last night that the United States will use two naval bases with complete deployments, one in Newfoundland and one in Trinidad. These two places will provide convenience for accommodating and repairing warships in the Atlantic. The Navy Department previously announced that the Newfoundland base was only a naval aircraft station, but today the Navy said that it can accommodate a fleet and allow battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, etc. to have the convenience of adding fuel and repairs. The cost of the Newfoundland base is $17,855,000. Both of these places are within the eight places leased from Britain.</p>
<h3>Lindbergh Dissatisfied with Interior Secretary's Remarks; Writes to President Roosevelt Demanding That Ickes Apologize</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - US Interior Secretary Ickes said on French National Day, July 14, that "studying the methods used by Hitler to disintegrate the internal organization and morale of other countries can make us understand how harmful Lindbergh and others are to the country." Ickes also referred to Lindbergh as a German nobleman and said that Lindbergh's remarks encouraged Hitler and undermined the willingness of the people to resist Nazism. Lindbergh has now written to the President, demanding that Ickes apologize, and declaring that he has no relationship with any foreign government. His receipt of medals was when he was working at the US Embassy. Ickes recently told reporters that he had never said that Lindbergh had a relationship with a foreign government. He only said that Lindbergh went to various places in the country to promote appeasement, shaking national unity, which was beneficial to the German government. Lindbergh should have returned his German Order long ago, regardless of how, when, or where he got it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Believes Mexican Embargo Is Clearly Aimed at Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - Today's Miyako Shimbun commented that Mexico's ban on the export of major goods to countries outside the Western Hemisphere was actually initiated by the United States behind the scenes. The newspaper said, "This move is clearly aimed at Japan, because only Japan buys these goods outside of the Americas. Japan should lodge a strong protest with Mexico regarding this matter."</p>
<h3>US Public Approves of the Occupation of Iceland: According to Public Opinion Poll Results</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 18th - A public opinion poll conducted by Gallup and published today showed that 61% of the US public approved of the US occupation of Iceland, while 20% opposed the move and 19% refused to make any criticism.</p>
<h3>North Ireland Permits Free Action by the US</h3>
<p>United Press, Belfast, 18th—Andrew, in Northern Ireland, gave the United States freedom of action in Northern Ireland yesterday. When asked for his opinion on American technical experts in Northern Ireland, Andrew told reporters, "The United States is free to act as it wishes in Northern Ireland. Any results negotiated between the United States and the United Kingdom can be endorsed by the Northern Ireland government." When asked if this included the landing of American armed forces, Andrew replied, "Of course, I will go to welcome them and shake hands with their commander." Regarding the presence of American troops in Northern Ireland, Andrew declined to elaborate, but when asked his opinion on the United States entering the war, he said, "The sooner, the better."</p>

<p>The United States is expanding its navy at a feverish pace. The United States currently has a total of fifteen battleships, three newly completed, and fourteen under construction. There are currently thirty-seven first-line cruisers, with fifty-four under construction. There are currently six aircraft carriers, with twelve under construction. As for destroyers, in addition to the ninety old ones given to the United Kingdom, there are still one hundred and sixty-four, with seventy-eight under construction, including the "Tudor Greig" and others with a displacement of 1,750 tons, comparable to destroyers. In addition, there are countless torpedo boats.</p>
<p>The construction of battleships has always been considered the largest and most time-consuming project. In the first half of this year alone, three ships were completed in one go, all five or six months ahead of schedule, which is truly a remarkable achievement. One ship, the "North Carolina," was launched in April at the New York Brooklyn Navy Yard; another, the "Washington," was launched in May in Philadelphia; and the third, the "South Dakota," was launched in early June in Camden, New Jersey, each with a displacement of 35,000 tons. Three of the seventeen new battleships for the US two-ocean fleet have now been completed.</p>
<p>Since the United States Navy built the battleship "Maryland" in December 1923, there had been no major achievements. The "North Carolina" being the first to be completed marks a new era in the history of the United States Navy. The keel of the ship was laid on Navy Day, October 27, 1937, and was originally scheduled to be completed by September 1 this year, but it was completed five months ahead of schedule. The cost was originally estimated at $67,725,500, but the total cost after completion will likely reach $70 million. The ship has a crew of 1,500 officers and men.</p>
<p>After the "North Carolina," "Washington," and "South Dakota" are completed successively, they should be formally incorporated into the fleet by July, at which time the United States Navy will have a total of eighteen battleships, which can be said to be unparalleled in the world in terms of quality. However, the advantage in quantity may not last long. The United Kingdom originally had fifteen battleships, and the three new ones will be completed soon. By the end of the year, Japan will also have completed two new battleships, bringing the total number of battleships to twelve.</p>
<p>The total number of battleships currently owned by the world's naval powers and those that can be built by the end of this year is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Country      Current Ships     Ships by Year-End</p>
<p>USA          15 ships          18 ships</p>
<p>UK           15 ships          17 or 18 ships</p>
<p>Japan        10 ships          12 ships</p>
<p>Germany      4 ships           4 ships</p>
<p>Italy        5-6 ships        5-6 ships</p>
<p>USSR         3 ships           3 ships</p>
<p>France       2 ships           2 ships</p>
<p>The above table does not include the battleships that the United Kingdom has lost, such as the "Hood." In addition to first-line battleships, Germany also has one pocket battleship (the "Bismarck" was recently sunk by the United Kingdom) and two old battleships converted into training ships. The French "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg" were severely damaged in Mers-el-Kébir and have likely been repaired. The remaining French battleships are probably all there are.</p>
<p>In terms of the quality of American battleships, no other country can match them. The "North Carolina" and its sister ships have a standard displacement of 35,000 tons (actual displacement of about 38,000 to 39,500 tons); the hull is 704 feet long and 108 feet wide at the waterline (only two feet narrower than the existing locks of the Panama Canal), with an average draft of 26 feet 8 inches.</p>
<p>The ship is equipped with nine 16-inch diameter, 45-caliber guns, divided into three triple turrets, capable of firing about 20 tons of shells per minute at targets 15 miles away. The engine is a four-screw propeller, with double rudders at the stern.</p>
<p>The ship's four sets of engines can generate 115,000 horsepower, with a speed of over 27 knots per hour. The giant auxiliary guns are used to attack ships and aircraft, and various small-caliber anti-aircraft guns are mounted everywhere. It usually carries three reconnaissance aircraft, which can be increased if necessary. The armor all over the ship can withstand 16-inch diameter shells and aircraft bombs at battle distances. In addition to triple armor on the bottom of the ship, there is also a density distribution system to assess the extent of damage from torpedoes or mines.</p>
<p>The "North Carolina" is more powerful than the newly built British "King George V." The American ship is equipped with nine 16-inch guns, while the British ship is only equipped with ten 14-inch guns. The auxiliary guns of the American ship are particularly powerful. The British ship may be one or two knots faster than the American ship, but the armor of the American ship is thicker.</p>
<p>The "North Carolina" is clearly superior to the French "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg" (displacement of 26,500 tons, equipped with eight 13-inch guns) and the German "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" (displacement of 26,000 tons, equipped with nine 11-inch guns).</p>
<p>The German new battleships "Bismarck" (already sunk by the United Kingdom) and "Tirpitz" are 730 feet long, 26 feet longer than the "North Carolina," and 118 feet wide, exceeding the American ship by 10 feet. The width of the hull of other countries' ships is unmatched. The ship is equipped with eight 15-inch guns, the firepower of which is not as strong as the nine 16-inch guns of the American ship, but they are divided into four turrets, making it easier to disperse the firepower. The auxiliary guns of the American ship are superior to those of the German ship, but the German ship is faster. The German ship has a displacement of 35,000 tons, with an average load of 37,500 tons.</p>
<p>The details of the new ships being built in Japan are unknown, but they are expected to be larger than the "North Carolina" class, with a displacement of around 40,000 tons, equipped with eight or nine 16-inch guns, and a speed of 29 to 30 knots per hour.</p>
<p>The "North Carolina" and its sister ships "Washington" and "South Dakota" are about to be incorporated into the United States First Fleet. Currently, the United States Pacific Fleet has twelve battleships, effectively all that it possesses, while the Atlantic Fleet has three older battleships with limited firepower. With the addition of these new forces, the strength of the United States in both oceans will be significantly enhanced.</p>

<h3>Finance: Unpredictable Foreign Exchange, Japanese Merchants Entering and Exiting Abruptly, Speculation Turning from Buying to Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the exchange rates quoted by HSBC. The gray market for British and American currency suddenly tightened, due to fewer US dollars being released by Japanese banks. Later, they stopped selling and instead aggressively bought British currency. Speculators began to buy on speculation, aggressively buying 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of US dollars. The price of gold had already soared past the 6,500 yuan mark, contributing to the tightening trend. Although foreign banks like Favorably and others were still supplying, the tightening trend became even more pronounced at noon. In the afternoon, the US dollar softened to 5.3125 yuan. Unexpectedly, Japanese banks began selling again, and speculators followed suit, causing the market to turn stronger again. Spot prices of 5.0375 yuan were briefly difficult to sell, and both British and American currency ultimately remained tight. Overall, trading was extremely active.</p>
<p>Tightening Trend Even Sharper at Noon</p>
<p>Since the morning's foreign telegrams showed flat tin prices and stable exchange rates in various countries compared to Shanghai, the Central Bank's quoted exchange rates were also flat. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices of 3 pence 28125 for spot British currency, and 5.40625 yuan for US dollars. Japanese banks initially sold August US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, creating a softening trend. Foreign banks traded July currency among themselves at the same price. HSBC's small counter quoted US dollars at 5.375 yuan, allowing the black market to settle August currency at 5.40625 yuan again. Later, Japanese banks stopped selling, and speculators started buying aggressively, reaching 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, at a price of 5.375 yuan, supplied by foreign banks such as Favorably. At noon, HSBC's small counter reduced US dollar quotes by 0.0625, to 5.3125 yuan. The gray market tightening trend became even sharper, and banks became less willing to supply. The noon closing price for British gold was 3 pence 234375, and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars.</p>
<p>The Market Gradually Stabilized at Closing</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, the price of gold continued to rise, so the US dollar softened to a tight price of 5.3125 yuan. Soon, Japanese banks began selling aggressively, and speculators turned to selling, selling to China Bank at 5.34375 yuan for August US dollars. Japanese banks then offered spot US dollars at 5.375 yuan, turning the market from tight to flat. At the 3:30 closing, both spot and August futures for British currency were at 3 pence 234375, and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars. Compared to the previous day's closing price, British currency tightened by 0.046875 and US dollars tightened by 0.0625.</p>
<p>No Change in Hong Kong Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th (Friday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no change in British, American, or Japanese exchange rates. (The previous day's spot closing price for US dollars was 24.625 yuan). The Shanghai exchange rate alone rose by 2.5 yuan to 457 yuan (the previous day's closing price was 454.5 yuan).</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Rising Sharply, Hovering Around 6,500 Yuan, Swap Premiums Have Decreased</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw active trading and rising prices, but reversed before the late closing. After breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, it re-entered, and the mood of various parties seemed uncertain. This was due to the US dollar easing as Japanese banks resumed aggressive selling, causing the buying on speculation to cease abruptly. Since the market opened high in the morning, rumors spread that the Exchange Equalization Account would only maintain the local US dollar exchange rate at 5.25 yuan, that the Central Bank would increase the issuance of banknotes, and that a certain party would take over the court. In addition, the foreign exchange market tightened sharply due to Japanese banks briefly halting sales. The Shanghai West gang and securities firms in the market added to their positions and aggressively bought, causing prices to rise from 6,455 yuan. At noon, it broke out of the 6,500 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams indicated the addition of a thousand taels, further increasing the upward momentum, reaching 6,535 yuan. Unexpectedly, the US dollar eased again due to Japanese banks selling, and rumors arose that a new cabinet would be formed in Japan and would advance in a favorable direction. The Shanghai West gang reduced their positions, scattered notes were settled, and prices reversed, falling by more than 40 yuan to below 6,500 yuan. However, the result was still a rise of 52 yuan. Total trading volume was more than 100,000 taels. The swap premium (July to August) was lowered by the seller to the buyer, with the premium falling to 50 yuan. Cash was in short supply all day, with prices 4562 yuan higher than the goods, an increase of over 40 yuan from the previous day. Jewelry was listed higher by 5 yuan, totaling 715 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Recovered Quickly</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the previous day's upward momentum, and the opening was immediately buoyed by buying, rising 42 yuan to 6,480 yuan. After Shanghai West Gu released supply, firms like Chengji, Deda, Xinfengyong, and Litai sold, and the market slightly decreased by 25 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, it advanced to 6,455 yuan. Litai, Tongkang Yongyi Yuan, and Hongqingyong bought, and upon hearing that speculators were aggressively buying August US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the market rallied, immediately rising 40 yuan, reaching 6,495 yuan. Xiangxingyong and Yinhao retreated to 6,477 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange market tightened further, and under the favorable rumors, Yiyuan started aggressively buying again. Chengda, Xinfengyong, Yida, Hongqingyong, and Dingsheng bought even more aggressively, increasing the upward momentum, suddenly soaring out of the 6,500 yuan mark, reaching 6,518 yuan, at which point Yifeng, Defu, and Dafeng sold, causing a small setback. The noon closing price was 6,510 yuan. The afternoon opening price was 6,515 yuan, 5 yuan higher. Tianyuan, Hengji, Yida, and Defu aggressively bought, continuing to push the price up to 6,535 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that Japanese banks were selling US dollars again, causing a reversal and easing, and the market declined. Yiyuan and Xiangxingyong released supply, while Tongkangyong and Yida all sold, and the price gradually decreased by over 40 yuan, falling below 6,500 yuan, retreating to 6,487 yuan. The 3:30 closing price was 6,490 yuan, a recovery of 52 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of 5.34375 yuan for August US dollars, it was 6,517 yuan, a difference of 27 yuan. After the closing, Shanghai West Gu resumed buying, and the final price was 6,4989 yuan. The total price range for the day was 80 yuan. The gold price for the main brand was 470 yuan higher than the futures price, and the purchase price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Heavily Listed Again</p>
<p>The exchange price for silver jewelry per tael was increased by 5 yuan at 11:30 in the morning by Datonghang and Xintonghang, totaling 715 yuan, with a 40 yuan reduction for purchases.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Recovered Strongly, US Dollar Futures Calculated in Hundreds of Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw strong prices, with British and American pounds rising by one yuan each. British gold notes remained unchanged, and market prices were stable. US dollar futures opened at 1,856 yuan (hereafter calculated per 100 US dollars). After opening, it retreated to 55 yuan, but then suddenly Zhihe, Liji, Chengfeng, Zhengda, Lianhe, Dongsheng, Heng, and others competed to buy, raising the price to 1,871 yuan at the closing. In the afternoon, the opening price was 1,870 yuan. After opening, Yili, Zhihe, Xiangyuanyong, Zhenhe, Dongsheng, Heng, and others bought, raising the price to 76 yuan. Xiangyuanyong, Yonghe, Zhengda, and others sold, retreating to 1,864 yuan at the closing. Hong Kong notes recovered by two cents, and Japanese gold notes recovered by one and a half cents. The evening market rose to 2 yuan and 02.5 cents. The trend for Korean exchange was also strong, with the evening market reaching 1 yuan and 66 cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Stagnant Hong Kong Sales, Double Horse Yarn Rising, Rumored Support from Bullish Companies, Tight Supply for Short Covering at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market has been in a chaotic state recently. Despite strong sales, market prices have declined. Spot transactions are clear, but the market has been able to rise, making people feel uncertain. In reality, a portion of large players are intermittently buying and selling Double Horse factory orders. Small speculators generally follow the trend, frequently suffering losses, so the trend of rotation is quite strong. There is also the idea that the market had the potential to decline, but was unfortunately held up by a group of bullish companies. Four major firms joined together to squeeze factory orders, thus supporting the market situation. But another argument is that, from 1,372 yuan all the way to the peak of 1,645 yuan, several large volumes of short sales were only sold around 1,400 yuan. Unexpectedly, a batch of transactions came from the Cantonese community, and as a result, the market gradually rose, and the short-sellers were unable to support it and went bankrupt. However, the amount of short sales is currently very small, and in addition, they were not able to cover sufficiently at the lower end. Although there is a bullish group, there is a lack of chips to squeeze. In light of this, actual sales are flourishing, and the foundation should be solid, otherwise there may be a reversal. Bulls posted a swap premium of one and a half yuan, with the final price at 7.5 cents. Shorts collected profit. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,594 yuan, and the low price was 1,587 yuan. Early afternoon trading was at 1,596 yuan, rising to 1,607 yuan, and the final price was 1,601.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened strong in the morning due to the presence of bullish companies. Retail investors rushed to cover, and the opening price was 1,589 yuan, rising directly to 1,594 yuan. Later, due to flat spot gold, sales of 20-count yarn remained unchanged. The Hong Kong community only bought 65 bales of 32-count yarn, and morale was flat, falling to 1,587 yuan. The closing price was 1,592 yuan, and after-hours trading was at 94 yuan. Statistics show that 6,565 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases by each community is listed below: Hong Kong: 65; Counterparts: 6,500.</p>
<p>Total: 6,565</p>
<p>The futures market situation for Golden Double Horse yarn: In the early morning opening, the atmosphere of the foreign exchange and gold prices rose sharply, and because the current period was coming to an end, short holders generally covered their positions, so the rise was quite sharp. The July contract rose 10 yuan from yesterday, and the August contract rose 8 yuan. Selling was slightly turned over in September, falling only 5 and a half yuan. After the opening, it was suddenly heard that the price of US cotton was mixed, Indian cotton fell, and the needs of the Hong Kong community were like a standstill. The long again turned to selling, and the July contract once fell to 1,436 yuan, the August contract to 1,452 and a half yuan, and the September contract was stable. After the entry, the price of gold was very strong, new buying and short covering rose frequently, and the price re-trended upward. The noon close was 10 yuan for July, 8 yuan for August, and 4 and a half yuan for September, with a turnover of 7,970 bales. It was later rumored that someone would take over the association. The July price once reached 1,445 yuan, the August contract 1,466 yuan, and the September contract 1,524 and a half yuan. The price increased first and then returned, and the result was 9 yuan for the July increase and 10 yuan for August from the previous day. The September contract was up 6 yuan, and the total daily turnover was 13,420 bales, a decrease of 2,110 bales from the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high and low prices are recorded (net offer).</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Transactions Extremely Active</h3>
<p>Although the spot cotton situation is firm, the factory transactions are not strong. However, morale is still very good, but the price of fine lint cotton has reached a considerable height, and sales have been reduced. The goal of speculative trading has been transferred to coarse lint.</p>
<p>Another message is that the foreign cotton ordering transactions of Shanghai foreign firms were exciting and eager. All parties were very keen on trading spot cotton, seeing that the ordering of US Indian cotton was cumbersome. At the same time, the city's situation is becoming firm due to the need for factories. In addition to the resale of large quantities of Indian and Brazilian cotton by peers, each factory has also transacted nearly a thousand bales of cotton on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell due to speculative selling, but then rose again due to buying by peers and foreign merchants. As a result, closing prices were up or down two to three points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was quite bland, falling due to speculative selling and a chaotic situation in the Far East. Yesterday's closing prices fell by two to three rupees each.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that today's opening will be up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Best-Selling Block Printed Cloths</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, and morale was firm. The selling of each cloth was slightly less than usual, but there were various goods, such as Qiankun printed gold three-tower bleached cloth and Yihuo Lun Chang factory, and the goods sold mostly increased. The sale of thin twill cloth was less powerful and was unable to rise, and the spot market transaction for each cloth this street was more than 500 pieces, and the transaction for flannel was gradually increasing. The South Ocean and Hong Kong community handled dyed printed cloths of about 10,000 pieces, and 250 pieces were transported to Yantai, and another five pieces were transported to Weihaiwei. Yesterday, 850 pieces were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dongbu went to the local and North Korean offices to deal with spot, and there was a high demand for narrow cloths. The company paid special attention to the product, and it strengthened. Each piece increased by 50 to 75 cents. Longtou's late price of a thin cloth factory order was 49 yuan and 25 cents, and it only increased by 25 cents, but the futures rose sharply in the exchange, and the result was a rise of 70 to 80 cents from the previous day. The morning price of the color goods Four Gentlemen Serge rose by one yuan and 61 and a half cents, and the later market reversed slightly by one yuan and 61 cents.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Scraps - Can Also Be Sold</h3>
<p>Wool prices are getting higher and higher, and a new business has been found, which is the use of waste. People are being sent out to collect scraps of wool, with the price of 3 yuan and 50 cents per catty for first-class (dismantled wool scraps) and 2 yuan and 78 cents per catty for second-class (tailor's wool scraps).</p>
<h3>Food: Floating Yang Rice, The Min Party Is Tired</h3>
<p>Yang rice is constantly arriving in ports. The Taigu Company's Suzhou wheel was informed in the past that it arrived in Shanghai on the 17th from Hong Kong with 22,000 bags of Yang rice. The (ancestor) berthed near Pudong for import, and yesterday it was transferred to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Today, 2,400 bags of maize will be transported to Yantai on the Taigu Company's Shuntian wheel.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the daily volatility of Yang rice was relatively flat. Since the rise and fall were small, speculators felt that their heroism was useless, and most large households watched with their arms folded. Floating households and retail customers still rose and fell with the market, but the actual elimination was greatly reduced, and the market finally saw smoothness and no surprises. The daily initial decline and then rise was only about half a yuan, and the trading volume was clear. In total, there were less than 10,000 bags in stock. Yinhua Temple still has more than 1,000 tons, and although speculative big customers have not cleared their minds, small customers have taken advantage of the low price to pull in. The early market opened with each Yang rice for the early phase compared to the previous day. After a drop of half a yuan, the market was fatigued and then pulled again, and the result was no difference. Only Yinhua Temple was a little more active, and the current rice was leveled by Hong Kong rice. Yinhua Temple was more active. The next term was at 149 yuan, the current was at 148 yuan and 20 to 30 cents, the scrap meter road was at 160 yuan and 50 to 60 cents, and number 2 Siamese rice was at 139 yuan and 50 cents to 140 yuan. It is now sold from 120 yuan and 50 cents to 119 yuan. The second is 117 yuan and 50 cents, number 1 Saigon is 128 yuan to 127 yuan and 50 cents, and the second is 126 yuan. Number 2 is 120 yuan to 119 yuan and 50 cents, the second is 116 yuan, and the scrap meter is 93 yuan to 91 yuan and 50 cents, the second is 89 yuan, and number 3 is 80 yuan. Due to the shutdown of the countryside and the small sales, the Min Party was also abruptly rubbed against by Pingmi yesterday, resulting in an unusually weak and tired state, depreciating 20 to 30 yuan. If the special goods were only 131 yuan, the general goods were 167 yuan, and the port clearance was 134 yuan.</p>
<p>The thick and thin Japanese rice and the Guoyang glutinous rice market both saw Yang rice return to flat, and the people were consistent and tended to stabilize. The supply and demand are similar, and all kept the original disk. The freshly opened fresh early and late rice from Nangang was 141 yuan and 50 cents, to 139 yuan. The Wuxi white japonica was 133 yuan, and the aged japonica was 130 yuan. The Hong Kong glutinous rice was 100 yuan. The high point was 123 yuan and 50 cents, the second point was 118 yuan, the glutinous lvk was 1134 yuan, and the Jindan was 1234 yuan. The second point was 1134 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Powder Market Has Seen A Slight Turn For The Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot Yangfen market situation saw a slight improvement. Due to the continuous fatigue, the price position gradually decreased, and this customer actually sold, and slightly entered at a low price. The hoarding households also intended to launch in view of the exchange rate and the price of gold. Therefore, the market turned from fatigue to firm. It is estimated that Jinlongfen was 31 yuan and 90 cents to 32 yuan, and Pao Tai Fen was 32 yuan and 80 cents to 80 cents. The total transaction was 10,000 packs. There were not many miscellaneous brand transactions. It was heard that there were people who directly matched customers, and the price was also firm, and the market gradually consolidated. There is still no market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Still Hover</h3>
<p>Public bonds on the unofficial market hovered between five and six jiao yesterday. The market price has fallen for three consecutive days, but Category C bonds have consistently failed to break through the one-yuan mark. The strength of the bulls can be seen here. Yesterday, sellers gradually felt weak, and some bears have already covered their positions. The situation for those receiving interest this period is gradually stabilizing, and even if there is a transfer, there are no major discrepancies. The market price trend may be moderately stable. Yesterday morning, Ding Kang Hong Da aggressively covered shorts, while Xie Kang Xie and Yuan bought more aggressively. Shuntai Xinfu Yichang went long, while Lianhe Runli Zhongyi and No. 16 sold. The morning session closed slightly firm. In the afternoon, it gradually felt stable, fluctuating only by one or two jiao. Lianhe bought back, Jiufeng slightly covered positions, and Yitai slightly absorbed supply. Renfeng Runde also made considerable purchases. Hongda's He Ji, Xinchang, Shengda, and No. 38 sold. Major bullish players shifted positions, gradually stabilizing. As a result, the market price, except for Category D bonds which remained unchanged, all others showed only slight changes of about five fen or one jiao. The turnover was estimated at about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 82 yuan and one jiao.</p>
<p>Various Industries: The stock market's activity has not diminished, and general prices are higher than the previous close, but the trend is still difficult to determine. Rubber stocks are stagnant and not firm.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Thursday) Cable: Today, the listed market prices of foreign government bonds and Far Eastern companies' stocks were all calm, with no changes in quotations.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Buying White Corn, Yellow Soybean Land Prices Reportedly Rising</h3>
<p>Corn: Yesterday's market was sluggish and then surged, due to a sudden large-scale purchase by the Japanese. They successively purchased over 3,000 bags of white corn, which boosted confidence, and prices surged by more than two yuan. The rest followed, rising by half a yuan to more than one yuan. The prices were as follows: Holland white corn, priced at 25.5 to 27.5 yuan; Yinghua Si, 48 yuan; yellow corn, 27.3 to 28 yuan; Saigon corn, 26.5 yuan; and new corn, 26.7 to 27 yuan. The total transaction volume reached more than 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yellow Soybeans: Japanese merchants have been continuously selling well, and with land prices in Tianjin reportedly rising, customers have been frequently buying in, so morale is high. Yesterday, 500 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, over 400 bags of Jiaozhou yellow soybeans, and nearly 1,000 bags of Guide yellow soybeans were sold, and prices surged again by about half a yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday (18th), there were 515 bags of soybeans, 3,000 pieces of soybean cakes, and 1,020 bags of sesame seeds shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Southern Dried Longan Suddenly Surges</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan: It is reported that the new crop has a poor harvest, and the stock in Shanghai is also low, so customers are unanimously optimistic. Sellers have only a small amount left, and prices rose again by forty or fifty. Dozens of pieces were traded. Market prices followed, and cold storage goods were even more firm and popular.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Fish Maws Expensive, Old Jellyfish Heads Firm</h3>
<p>Dried fish maws are expensive because of difficulties in sourcing. Although the new crop has already appeared on the market, prices remain high: Ningbo goods 250 yuan, Zhoushan goods 410 yuan, Yantai goods 340 yuan.</p>
<p>Jellyfish heads and jellyfish skins: Old goods are better, so old goods are firm and new goods are weak. Yesterday, new jellyfish skins were 120 yuan, Dong goods were 150 yuan, new jellyfish heads were 80 yuan, and Sun goods were 125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Very Little</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much fluctuation in the sugar market. The Association's spot market: current two-four raw white sugar for February arrival was 93 yuan, March arrival was 93 yuan to 93.45 yuan, April arrival was 94 yuan, June arrival was 96 yuan, July 20th delivery was 96.1 yuan, all showing slight increases. July 30th delivery remained at 96.4 yuan. Dutch red, one or two jiao better; KD mark, 76.5 yuan; NT mark, 74.2 yuan; Taikoo Car White B mark, 117.5 yuan; DY mark, 104.3 yuan; HX mark, new goods 94 yuan, old goods 93.5 to 93.7 yuan. In addition, 3,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin today (19th).</p>
<h3>Metals: Wire Rods Look Promising</h3>
<p>The recent market conditions for new wire rods are considered very good, due to the impact of the continued interruption of overseas supplies. Moreover, nail factories, wire drawing factories, and machinery factories in this street have the intention to purchase frequently, and the turnover is not sluggish. The industry is in high spirits. Looking at the future trend of this commodity, the market is promising due to supply issues. Standard quotations are also rising. Yesterday, good quality goods were sold for 235 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while ordinary goods were quoted at around 225 yuan, about 5 to 10 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>

<h3>With Social Welfare as the Premise: Gas Company Reduces Surcharges, Company Voluntarily Implements, Perseverance Worthy of Praise, Other Public Utilities Should Emulate, Motion Already Declared Passed by the Public Utilities Committee</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, when the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council held a meeting, it discussed a proposal that made people happy to hear about, namely, the suggestion of the Shanghai British-owned Gas Company to reduce surcharges. After the proposal was put forward, it was carefully discussed by the committee, and it was unanimously agreed that since the price reduction was voluntarily implemented by the company, there was no reason to prevent it, and it was immediately declared passed.</p>
<p>Surcharge Reduced by About 35%</p>
<p>Afterwards, reporters learned from well-informed sources that the amount of the surcharge that the gas company requested to reduce was about 35%. According to the company, the surcharge was levied at 250%. Although the reduced amount is small, at a time when various public utilities are repeatedly increasing prices, only the gas company is able to consider the burden on users and resolutely announce a price reduction. Its spirit of considering the public interest will undoubtedly win the sympathy and admiration of the citizens. It is said that the company's reason for implementing the price reduction is the rationalization of production equipment and the increase in the production of by-products, that is, the result of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Should Emulate</p>
<p>As a result, the general public is reminded of the price increases of other public utilities in the International Settlement, especially the recent increase of more than 60% in tram and bus fares, which has caused a new and heavy burden on life. Although the general public has repeatedly given advice to tram and bus companies, urging them to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, it has apparently not been effective. The practice of ticket collectors skimming profits prevails as before, which is clear evidence of this. Therefore, after the citizens heard the news that the gas company was implementing a price reduction, they all hoped that other public utilities could also follow suit, vigorously increase revenue and reduce expenditure, so as to reduce the burden on the citizens and restore the so-called reputation of public utilities.</p>
<p>Officially Announced Next Thursday</p>
<p>It is also heard that although the gas company's price reduction proposal has been passed by the Public Utilities Committee, it still needs to be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting to be convened at 4:30 pm next Wednesday for approval. A public announcement regarding this matter is expected to be issued next Thursday. It is generally believed that the implementation of this case is without doubt.</p>
<p>Nanyang Coal Shipments to Shanghai Increase Daily</p>
<p>Due to the lack of coal transport ships in the city earlier, the arrival of goods was scarce, coal merchants hoarded goods, and market prices soared. The bituminous coal used by the Municipal Council factory and the raw materials of coal balls and coal dust used by households all skyrocketed. In the past month, as the situation in the Pacific has gradually become clearer, the quantity of coal from Hong Gai Coal in Vietnam, Borneo, India, Keelung, and other places shipped to Shanghai has been huge, and the inventory is sufficient, and market prices are trending downwards. The coal balls needed for daily use by citizens have also fallen from 17 yuan to 15.8 or 16 yuan. Yesterday, another 10,000 tons of bituminous coal arrived in the city.</p>
<p>Rumor Tangshan Coal Supplying Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Havas News Agency's Tianjin news published in a Japanese newspaper stated that the Shanghai Power Company has recently engaged in consultations with the Kailan Mining Bureau and Portuguese shipping companies, and several Portuguese ships will carry Tangshan coal from the Kailan Mining Bureau from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai for supply. Regarding this statement, neither the Shanghai Power Company nor the Kailan branch have confirmed it.</p>
<p>Power Authorities Hope for Realization</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hopkin, president of the Power Company, he told reporters that as far as he knew, the Power Company had agreed with the Kailan Mining Bureau since 1937 to transport 25,000 tons of coal per month from North China to Shanghai for supply, and there was no change. Mr. Wei, director of the Kailan branch in this city, also said that he did not know of any consultations to increase the number of coal shipments. An investigation revealed that the Shanghai Power Company's fuel supply is mainly based on Kailan coal. Although the parties concerned do not believe the news from the Havas News Agency, Hopkin hopes that this news is true. As for the issue of ships carrying coal to Shanghai, there is no major change either.</p>
<h3>Local Russian Émigrés Enthusiastically Donate to the Moscow Red Cross</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war three and a half weeks ago, the total amount of donations from Russian émigrés in Shanghai to the Russian Red Cross Special Fund has reached about 40,000 yuan, of which 25,000 yuan was collected by the Russian-language newspaper and transferred to the Moscow National Bank, and 10,000 yuan was donated by members of the Soviet General Association. In addition to these two formal institutions collecting donations for the Red Cross, the Henry Road Russian-Chinese Credit Cooperative has also collected several thousand yuan in donations from Russian émigrés. It is said that the Russian-Chinese Credit Cooperative was recently accused by the White Russian Immigration Committee of being a non-Russian institution because it collected donations for the comfort of the army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Taxpayers' Association Changes Name</h3>
<p>The Japanese Taxpayers' Association held a meeting on the 12th to discuss the issue of reorganization. At that time, it was decided to change the name to the "Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council Japanese Taxpayers' Association Settlement Issues Consultation Committee," and actively carry out the organization, set up a sub-committee, and on the 17th, it was decided to appoint the following eight people as members of the association, and appointment letters have been issued. The list is as follows: Hashimoto Gojiro, Mimura Masataka, Kannō Ekisaburō, Tsutsumi Takashi, Yasui Gengo, Sugimura Hirozo, Sakamoto Keiji, Watari Ichigoro.</p>
<h3>British Association in China Registers Women to Replace Men Serving in the Military</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the General Affairs Committee of the British Association in China announced at a meeting on the 15th of this month that it had established a special committee in accordance with the suggestion made by Ms. Mann at the members' meeting on June 27th to register British women overseas. Any British woman who is willing to work overseas or is prepared to replace the positions of British men so that men can serve in the military can go to register.</p>
<h3>Chinese Taxpayers' Association Suddenly Occupied Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association at No. 303, Bank Association Building, 54 Hong Kong Road, International Settlement, had been closed for business for a long time, and all the staff had left. Therefore, the association closed the office, and only the police were stationed there regularly. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., De Shouqi suddenly arrived with two Japanese nationals. The police officers on duty stopped them. They telegraphed the police station, and the police sent personnel. After some consultation, the police officer stated that he would not interfere. De entered the address, collected various documents, and sent people to guard the premises.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Leaves Shanghai for Tianjin This Morning, Will Transfer to Peiping to Handle Affairs, Will Return to Shanghai from Beidaihe After Autumn Cools</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing this spring and has remained in Shanghai and Tianjin in North China, rarely interacting with the outside world except for handling embassy affairs. After Cosme recently arrived in Shanghai by plane from Peiping, Shanghai newspapers repeatedly reported that the ambassador would go to Beidaihe for summer vacation, but this was denied by the official authorized Havas News Agency. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency has learned from relevant parties that Cosme does indeed have a trip to the north. He is scheduled to fly directly to Tianjin from Datong by plane this morning. After a short stay in Tianjin, he will go to Peiping to handle official duties and then go to Beidaihe for summer vacation. He will return to Shanghai when the autumn cools. The air ticket has been booked early. The embassy in Shanghai telegraphed Peiping on the 17th to report the travel schedule.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Wheel Parts Unloaded Yesterday, Japanese Side Says Further Research Required, The Wheel Approved for Export on Monday</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel, which was carrying more than 200 boxes of machinery parts entrusted by Anli Foreign Company to Singapore, was exported at noon on the 10th of this month. It was detained by the Japanese Navy at the mouth of Wusong and berthed at the Donggou Junpu Bureau Wharf. It has been more than a week since the Japanese side delayed checking the machinery parts, delaying the voyage of the ship. It is said that the more than 200 boxes of machinery parts loaded on the ship began to be unloaded yesterday and piled up on the wharf. The Japanese side still needs to check it. The ship is scheduled to continue exporting next Monday and sail to Singapore and Yangon. However, Anli Foreign Company has long denied the so-called machinery parts being transported to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Luo Yunyan Escorted to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, according to sources from the Christian community, Legislative Councilor Luo Yunyan has now been escorted to Jiangning.</p>
<h3>Summer Night Curfew Strictly Enforced in Border Areas</h3>
<p>Recently, the police departments of the two concessions, in view of the arrival of hot weather, may be lax about the night curfew. In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from infiltrating and ensure the security of the concession, they have strictly strengthened the curfew and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western armed detectives to check pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving at the border, such as the intersection of Haig Road and Shantou Road, the intersection of Foch Road and Great West Road, and the traffic arteries of Jing'an Temple Road, Yu Ge Road, and Jessfield Road. All passengers in passing vehicles must get out of the car and be searched one by one, and packages and objects are also strictly inspected to prevent carrying weapons. In addition, the number of pedestrians detained for violating the curfew has also increased in recent days.</p>
<h3>Customs Anti-Smuggling Hopes for Cooperation</h3>
<p>According to news from the Jianghai Customs yesterday, although the Customs feels difficulties in anti-smuggling due to environmental pressure, it still tries to order all tax police to pay attention to the cargo transportation of merchants. All merchants who transport domestic and foreign goods in and out must report to the Customs for inspection, and can only be shipped after inspection. Whether the domestic goods are transported from the production area to Shanghai by water, land or air, and are intended to be transshipped to other ports from Shanghai, they must also pay the transit tax to the designated office of the Customs or to the temporary checkpoint before they can be transshipped to other ports, otherwise they will be regarded as smuggling private goods and will be severely punished in accordance with the established regulations. However, in addition to repeatedly ordering the tax police under its jurisdiction to work hard to combat smuggling, the Customs also hopes that merchants and people will give their full cooperation to jointly eliminate the evil habit of smuggling, thereby increasing national tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of Five Kinds of Unified Bonds Due Paid in Full</h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers' four banks to discount and pay the eleventh principal and interest due on the unified public bonds of the Republic of China in the twenty-fifth year, Class A, B, C, D, and E. The Central Bank and the China and Communications Banks entrusted by it throughout the country are designated to pay the money. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to handle the payment from the 31st of this month, and has rushed to handle the payment procedures. It is hoped that bondholders will go to collect it at that time. Domestic debts guaranteed by the current customs surplus can be paid in full, which is deeply supported by bondholders.</p>
<h3>British Court in China First Hears Lease Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British Court in China in this city heard the first case of a foreign lease dispute. It is understood that the plaintiff's lawyer is also the participant in the same case, so it has aroused interest from all parties. The reason for the lawsuit is that the defendant wanted to sublet the disputed house to a third party, which was not satisfied by the plaintiff, so he filed a lawsuit with the court for an injunction. The case was heard by Judge Moser. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jones, requested the court to prohibit the defendant from subletting the disputed house and to order the payment of four months' rent, totaling 1,340 yuan. It is said that although the defendant has not sublet the house now, the defendant is about to leave Shanghai, and this kind of behavior is likely to occur. However, according to the contract between the two parties, subletting is prohibited. Judge Moser ruled that the defendant did not appear in court and should be prohibited from disposing of the disputed house in any way before the end of the litigation.</p>
<h3>Post Office Recruits Letter Carriers, More Than 500 People Admitted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration publicly recruited letter carriers, and the written examination was rescheduled to be held on the 8th of last month, and was held on a regular basis. However, the number of people admitted was previously rumored to be between 150 and 200. According to a reporter from Dalian News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office has never announced the number of employees recruited at all levels in the past. Those who pass the examination will be admitted and appointed to fill vacancies. Therefore, there were more than 540 people admitted on the list released on the previous (13th) day.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Shanghai Charity Organizations</h3>
<p>Since the sudden changes in the situation, the French Concession Charity Organization has been planning for several years by local philanthropists, and it has felt stretched and extremely difficult. Since this year, it has been even more painful. Because the Charity Organization has long had the reputation of having property, and donations have never been solicited, various charitable donations are often rejected. However, it is not known that the property of the organization, such as the central part of the city, has been largely destroyed by war, with only half of the building remaining. If it is left alone, it will be dismantled by petty thieves; if it is repaired, the cost will be huge. If one or two are selected for repair, there are very few reliable tenants. The previously large income has been transformed into expenses. Even in the concession area, the rent has always been low, and the landlord is responsible for water and electricity. Now that water and electricity have soared, there is little profit after deducting expenses. If the intention is to increase, it is often said that charitable organizations should not be compared with operators, half asking for help and half smiling sarcastically. After many persuasion, only a few have increased. In addition, the land rent has been scarce for several years, so let's leave it alone. Last year, the income was more abundant, and the land rent was naturally larger. However, local agencies collect donations and taxes, and local tycoons collect fees. After deducting here and there, the remaining rent is almost insufficient to cover the local expenses. In addition, various stocks, etc., have stopped paying interest since the war. As for the subsidy from the Municipal Council, after repeated negotiations, the increase is very small. In short, even though philanthropists from all sides occasionally give alms every month, it is just a drop in the bucket. This is the general situation of income.</p>
<p>As for the current expenditure, all the good deeds such as the Vagrant Training Center, the Qingjie Hall, the Nursery, the Vocational Training Center, and the schools are given a certain amount to each person every month due to practical difficulties to make a slight change in relief. Medicine is given, and it is still continuing. All of this can be done by trying to make do with the surplus and deficit. However, the most difficult thing is the coffin burial of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and the food supply of the nursing home. The price of boards has been increasing monthly. What used to be four or five yuan per coffin is now more than fifty yuan. What used to be three or four hundred coffins per month is now more than six hundred coffins. The cost of boards alone requires more than 30,000 yuan per month. The other ancillary expenses will naturally increase with it. Since the price of rice has risen repeatedly, the food supply of the nursing home has also become a major problem, as well as the rice subsidies and salaries of the staff and workers, which are all affected, and there is no month without a slight increase, and there is no month without problems. This is the general situation of expenditure.</p>
<p>The income is like that, and the expenditure is like this. Now, like pulling vines to repair the roof, the excavation has been exhausted. The accounts of the lumber store for the Dragon Boat Festival have not been settled yet. Before the war, there were already many debts for construction projects. If we move and take again, there is no pledge, and the budget is just a formality, and the aftermath is difficult to predict. If the price of boards rises again and epidemics prevail, it will affect both the social appearance, residents, and hygiene. Those who die on the road cannot be ignored for a day, and the elderly cannot be unsupported for a day. There is no way to turn stone into gold, and it is difficult to cook without rice. We must ask local philanthropists to generously donate money and jointly provide relief.</p>
<h3>Director-General of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Kiuchi, Rushes Back to China</h3>
<p>Kiuchi Shiro, former Finance Officer of the Ministry of Finance stationed in China, was transferred to the Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. He was originally scheduled to return to China on the Kobe Maru on the 24th. However, due to the change of the Japanese cabinet and changes in the political situation, he decided to move forward to return to China by plane on the morning of the 19th to take office.</p>

<h3>Ten American Ships Carrying Relief Supplies to China, Crushed Wheat and Medicines Already on Their Way, Meyer to China to Assist in Distribution</h3>
<p>Regarding the American Red Cross's relief efforts to China, the message received this week is that large quantities of crushed rice, crushed wheat and medicines have been transported to China by the American Red Cross. On July 13, the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington announced that medical supplies worth one million US dollars would be transported to China by the first American cargo ship sailing from the Pacific coast. According to Red Cross President Davis, the total value of relief supplies shipped to China has reached 3.5 million US dollars. It is understood that the Red Cross relief supplies that are currently on their way to China include the Collis Worth wheel carrying 39,998 bags of crushed wheat, totaling 19,999,900 pounds, and three large boxes of gauze. The Kodak Brock wheel also carries a large number of medicines. In addition, 490,000 pounds of crushed wheat have been shipped from Seattle to Shanghai by the Faraway Ray wheel. In addition, the West Leif wheel, which departed from Seattle on June 15, also carried 200 pounds of crushed wheat. The Kapura wheel, which departed from the same place on June 25, also carried 2 million pounds of crushed wheat. In addition, the Rugan Xinzi wheel, which departed from San Francisco on June 20, also carried 400,000 pounds of crushed wheat. The Coolidge President wheel, which left Seattle on July 13, also carried 400,000 pounds of crushed wheat. The Johnson President, scheduled to leave San Francisco on July 23, will also carry 400,000 pounds of crushed wheat. The Clifford President, which left San Francisco on the 3rd of this month, also carries 400,000 pounds of crushed wheat. It is learned that the churches in Ningbo and Shaoxing have sent telegrams to the Shanghai Red Cross, requesting that as much relief wheat as possible be shipped to these two places because of the serious famine in these areas. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed to have Japanese ships carry it. It is also learned that the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington has sent Mr. Meyer to China to assist Mr. Wesley, the chief executive of the Red Cross in China. Meyer will manage the distribution of medicines, food, and clothing. These items are all transported to the interior of China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Meyer has served the Red Cross for 23 years. He engaged in relief work in the war zone during the European War, and also worked in Siberia. His footprints have spread almost all over the United States, and he has extremely rich experience in deploying relief projects.</p>
<h3>Crime Reduced Sharply in the International Settlement, Only 17 Criminal Cases Yesterday, Lowest Record for Trial Cases</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that only 17 criminal cases were tried in the First Special District Court today (18th), breaking the lowest record of 27 cases on Tuesday, which shows that criminal activity in the International Settlement has been reduced to the lowest new level. Usually, the five courts of the First Court hear more than 100 cases a day. The sharp reduction in the number of cases this time is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Japanese Nationals and Japanese Troops in Central China: Over 130,000 Japanese Nationals, Over 600,000 Japanese Troops</h3>

<h3>Shinai Wheel Out of Danger</h3>
<p>The British Yilong Company's Shinai Wheel, which was carrying rice from Yangon to Tianjin, encountered danger in the waters of Chengshan, Shandong. The company authorities immediately sent a wheel to rescue it. According to Yilong Company yesterday, after unloading part of the rice, the ship was out of danger. Now the ship has left Chengshan carrying the original goods and continued to Tianjin, and will arrive at its destination soon.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Registration Begins Next Week; Monks Contribute Alms for Scholarship: Yesterday's Receipts Exceeded Previous Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of fundraising for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund. Donations from all quarters have been increasingly enthusiastic. From dawn till dusk, over eight hundred yuan were collected. Many readers have expressed their willingness to donate goods to the newspaper for a charity sale, which is deeply appreciated. However, due to the complexity of charity sale procedures, we regret that we cannot proceed with it. We kindly request that donations be converted into cash for convenience. The application forms and registration forms that were drafted previously will be printed shortly, and we anticipate that applications and registration can begin within the next week.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donation Record</p>
<p>Yesterday's donors included Mr. Bian Zongyuan, two hundred yuan; Mr. Ma Zhigang, two hundred yuan; Mr. Feng Zhengxiang, two hundred yuan; Mr. Zheng Liangbin, two hundred yuan; Mr. Shi Naixiu, twenty yuan; Ying She, fifteen yuan; Mr. Gu Qiying's fundraising from four people, four yuan; Monk Guangjue, three yuan; Mr. Cheng Yaoting, two yuan; Mr. Jiang Guang, one yuan and twenty-five cents. The above totaled eight hundred forty-six yuan and twenty-five cents. The total to date is four thousand three hundred twenty-three yuan and seventy-two cents.</p>
<p>Even Outsiders Do Not Stand Idly By</p>
<p>Monk Guangjue of the Yuanming Lecture Hall on the Great Western Road was deeply moved by the scholarship fund launched by this newspaper. He sent three yuan via mail yesterday, stating in the letter that compassion is inherent in all humanity and is a factor in promoting society. Although monks renounce the world to study Buddhism, how can Buddhist teachings be separated from worldly affairs? Moreover, compassion is the gateway to enlightenment, and charity is the foremost of the six perfections. To break free from delusion and greed, one must focus on it. The academic aspirations of Ni, Bao, and Wu are strong, but they are hindered by circumstances. Their situation is pitiful, and their ambition is commendable. I am ashamed that I cannot provide substantial assistance. I humbly offer three yuan from my alms. The amount is small, and I feel ashamed, but accumulating like ants carrying burdens is each doing their best.</p>
<p>A Reader's Benevolent Act of Donating Found Money is Commendable</p>
<p>Reader Mr. Jiang Guang found one yuan and twenty-five cents in legal tender at the corner of the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre the night before last. After waiting for a long time with no one claiming it, he immediately sent it yesterday as a donation. Mr. Jiang's honesty in returning found money is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Scholarships are a National Duty</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Zhigang wrote, "Your newspaper's initiation of a readers' scholarship fund benefits disaster victims and brings blessings to humanity. I deeply agree with this righteous act. I offer a check for two hundred yuan as a small contribution to fulfill my national duty." Also, Mr. Bian Zongyuan of Chang Ji Trading Company wrote, "Our family tutor taught classes in the disaster children's education center and mentioned Ni's academic progress. Please consider providing assistance. At the time, I promised to help with his book and stationery expenses. Now that I know your newspaper has a comprehensive plan to help with his food, lodging, and other expenses for three years, I have already promised to help with his book expenses, which are estimated to be about one hundred yuan for the entire junior high school. I am donating an additional one hundred yuan to the scholarship fund." The enthusiasm of Mr. Ma and Mr. Bian is deeply admired by our colleagues.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Readers Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yinbin of Muir Road generously donates fifty yuan per semester and wrote to express his views: "... I deeply admire the rigorous organization and grand scale of your newspaper's scholarship fund. In my opinion, this matter should be sustained. Relying solely on temporary donations may lead to interruptions, as was seen in refugee relief efforts. However, refugees can be dispersed at any time, but the education of disaster victims cannot be abandoned halfway. At that time, advancing or retreating will be difficult, and one will feel the pain of building a mountain but failing to complete it. Therefore, in addition to temporary donations, it is more appropriate to solicit permanent donations, such as recognizing several disaster-stricken children each semester. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai, and they can devise proper methods." In addition, Ying She and young Gu Qiying also have good ideas, but due to length constraints, they are not recorded.</p>
<h3>Female Leg Discovered in the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The Water Police Department is currently investigating a bizarre case of a dismembered female thigh. The case occurred at 6:00 AM yesterday. A sampan of the Water Police Department was patrolling near the Tianhou Temple Bridge on the Suzhou Creek when they discovered a section of a snow-white human leg floating in the water. It was immediately retrieved and taken for inspection. The leg had been severed at the knee, and the toes were intact. Based on the skin and flesh, it was determined to be the leg of a young woman and must have been severed not long ago, as the leg showed no signs of decay or swelling. However, why it was severed and where the woman's body is remain under investigation by the police. General observations suggest that the case likely involves a romantic entanglement.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Manager Assaults a Patron</h3>
<p>A major fight occurred at the Cosmopolitan Dance Hall, 577 Jing'an Temple Road, at approximately 8:00 PM on the 12th of this month. A man named Tang Zhujiu visited the hall that evening and, for some unknown reason, had a verbal dispute with the dance hall manager. Unexpectedly, the hall gathered over ten people and surrounded Tang, severely beating him and causing him multiple injuries. The dance hall not only insulted a patron on whom they depended for their livelihood but also dared to gather over ten people to beat him, causing him serious injuries. This is truly a disregard for the law. He has entrusted lawyer Qian Zheng to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special District Court against the assailants and has also submitted an injury report to the forensic department. The case will be heard in court soon.</p>
<h3>Shen Yuan Gambling Den Cracked Down On: Owner Arrested; Two More Small Gambling Dens Raided</h3>
<p>After the closure of the Shanghai West gambling dens, some gamblers secretly set up gambling dens to lure people to gamble. The Shen Yuan gambling den on Connaught Road was one of them. However, due to a lack of secrecy, it was cracked down on by Pan Da and his police officers. It is reported that the owner of the gambling den, a notorious gangster nicknamed "Tiger Wang," Wang Jingfu, was also arrested yesterday.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Pan Da, the special police officer of Shanghai West, personally led special police officers to raid two small gambling dens on Robison Road and Kangjiaqiao on the afternoon of the 17th. The special police department admitted that there are still some small gambling dens existing in the Western District but claimed that they would be closed down as soon as they are discovered.</p>
<h3>Tian Yuan Xiang Jewelry Store Burglarized in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>At approximately 2:00 PM yesterday, several vagrants loitered in front of Tian Yuan Xiang Jewelry Store, 289 Avenue Joffre, French Concession. At the time, the store and pedestrians did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, the vagrants smashed the glass of the display window at the store entrance and grabbed the diamonds and jewelry on display, scattering and fleeing. After the store employees discovered the theft and chased after them to report it to the police, one person was arrested. It is said that the value of the diamonds and jewelry stolen from the store was over nine thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Post Office Wins Prize in the Third Installment of Prize-Linked Savings Bonds</h3>

<h3>Smokeless Tobacco Stolen from the Maotai Trading Company: Both People and Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Six barrels of smokeless tobacco worth 18,000 yuan were stolen from the warehouse of the British-owned Maotai Trading Company at 285 Lundy Lane between May 29th and June 29th. Five suspects, including broker Wu Qifu from Yangzhou, have been arrested by the Huishan Police Department and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The date is being changed. The Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case, based on the confession of Yongren Fang Dechun, who was arrested at the Sanhua Foreign Warehouse on Guangdong Road, continued to apprehend Chai Zengbao from Suzhou, Fan Xixiang, Hu Ming, Gu Asan, Yongren Ma Rongqing, Fang Yougen, and six others at the Huamei and other smokeless tobacco shops at 446 Xiaoshadu Road, Lane 10, 725 Xinzha Road, and 623 Tong Road, and seized sixteen bundles of the stolen smokeless tobacco. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the defendants had all purchased the smokeless tobacco from Zhu Afu, who is at large, at a low price. He requested detention for a detailed investigation and a later joint trial with Wu Qifu and others. The defendants claimed that they had heard that the smokeless tobacco was cheap goods auctioned off by the Fuhe Trading Company and that they were unaware that it was stolen goods, and they pleaded for leniency. The court ordered them to be returned to custody for a joint trial with Wu Qifu and others and denied bail.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Report on the General Education Conditions by the Director of Education of Guangdong: Emphasizing Both the Examination of Teachers' Qualifications and Increased Funding; National Education Can Be Implemented in the New System Counties</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Airmail Report) The Guangdong Provincial Provisional Assembly held its fifth general meeting at 9:00 AM on July 8th. The report on the general education conditions was given by Huang Linshu, Director of Education, and Secretary Chen Jiaqi reported on behalf of him. Director Huang himself answered when questions were asked. Secretary Chen's report mainly focused on the promotion of national education. In terms of schools, it was stipulated that starting from January of last year and this year, the 27 counties such as Qujiang, which began implementing the new county system, should increase the number of township national schools without central schools by at least 40% of the number of counties. The 12 counties such as Jieyang and Xinyi, which began implementing the new system in July of this year, must set up all the townships and towns without central schools within this year, ensuring that the national schools should reach at least 30% of the number of counties. Regarding the counties behind the front and not implementing the new county system, such as the 30 counties and bureaus such as Lingshan, at least half of the townships and towns should have central schools within this year, and the national schools that should be set up should reach at least 20% of the number of counties. Regarding the implementation situation since May, the counties have obeyed the order to establish 1,551 township (town) central schools and 7,035 national schools. Among them, those who have handled it quickly and can set up sufficient central schools according to the original plan include 34 counties such as Qujiang. Those who can establish national schools according to the plan include 21 county bureaus such as Meixian and Xingning. According to statistics on the number of schools, since the implementation of national education, as of May, there are a total of 1,581 central schools, which is still 900 schools short, and a total of 7,055 national schools have been established, which is still 4,000 schools short. It is believed that the plan to set up schools this year can be completed by continuing to prepare for the establishment at the beginning of the next semester. In terms of teachers, as of April of this year, 11,861 qualified teachers and 1,158 substitute teachers were examined and qualified. The unqualified teachers will continue to be examined and identified in all counties of the province from June 15th to August 15th. Secondly, one-year simple normal schools will be set up separately in the counties, and the quality and quantity of normal subjects for high school students will be increased, emphasizing both. In terms of funding, the national education funding for this year is a total of 1.3 million yuan, an increase of more than 570,000 yuan compared with last year. The new system counties have paid great attention to the implementation of national education, which is a good phenomenon. The more important thing is to promote the self-raising of funds in various townships (towns), making it a trend. Secondly, regarding the general situation of secondary schools, a total of 305 schools have been reported for record, which has restored the number of schools that withdrew from Guangzhou. Regarding the lack of books and instruments, the Education Department has been actively trying to find a solution. After the report was completed, Senator Zhang Guangdi asked: 1. What are the disposal methods for counties that do not implement education orders? 2. Have surveys been conducted on school-age children in various places who are out of school? 3. What measures are taken for normal school graduates who are unwilling to serve? Senator Chen Zhiqian asked a total of nine questions about the problems of primary and secondary school teachers, which were answered separately by Director Huang and then dismissed.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Plans to Establish a Branch School in Fujian; Shanghai School Continues as Usual</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Yong'an telegram stated that National Jinan University was about to move inland. According to the person in charge of the school in this city, it is a fact that the school has repeatedly requested to move inland. However, recently, an order was received from the Ministry of Education only allowing the establishment of a branch school in Fujian. After receiving the order, the school immediately telegraphed the Fujian Education Department for assistance and has sent personnel on their way to prepare everything a few days ago. The Shanghai school is still proceeding as usual and there is no talk of moving inland.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Student Relief Association: Summer Relief Work; Allocates Huge Sum of Money to Open Student Cafeteria</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA, in addition to operating student relief funds and a student economic dormitory, also plans various new undertakings this year, which have been well received by people from all walks of life. According to Lin Yonghou, a staff member of the YMCA Student Department, the following is a detailed report to the Dahua News Agency regarding the recent summer relief work conducted by the association:</p>
<p>Summer Social Service Work</p>
<p>Hundreds of students have already applied to participate in this work. The association will select 100 people to engage in work after strict review. Because this type of work contains the meaning of social understanding and self-help education, those who participate in the work will be given corresponding rewards depending on their work performance. Social service work is roughly divided into three types: (1) Social life survey. The survey of beggar children's lives is temporarily set, and experts from Shanghai are invited to guide it. (2) Lane children's education work. Participants will be trained for a considerable period of time before engaging in work. (3) Church youth work. Encourage church youth to pay attention to and participate in various activities in the church.</p>
<p>Student Cafeteria Under Active Preparation</p>
<p>In view of the seriousness of the student food problem in Shanghai, the association has specially requested the National General Association to allocate a huge sum of money to open a student cafeteria in order to solve the food problem for general students under the three principles of nutrition, hygiene and economy. It is learned that the association has invited Yang Huaiseng and others to form a committee to actively arrange the interior so as to meet the needs of the students when the schools open in the next semester, and will investigate some extremely poor students and give them certificates to enjoy special discounts when they go to eat in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Relief Application for the Next Semester</p>
<p>The application date for student relief funds for the next semester will begin in mid-August. Applicants are requested to complete the procedures for the school transcript and the school's introduction letter as soon as possible. The amount of relief money has increased slightly, with high school students receiving 70 yuan per person and university students receiving 100 yuan per person.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Art College Holds a Student Exhibition</h3>
<p>Suzhou Art College is hosted by the famous painter Yan Wenshou. The school has a well-established reputation, and the students' achievements are quite remarkable. Since the fall of Suzhou, it has rented a school building on the seventh floor of the Enterprise Building on Sichuan Road in Shanghai and has continued to operate for more than three years. Usually, there are many insights between teachers and students in their studies, and the past art exhibitions have been well received. It is learned that a student exhibition will be held at the original site of the school for five days from the 20th to the 24th of this month. The achievements of the students in recent years will be brought together. It is expected that there will be a number of good works for evaluation by all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Academic Lecture</p>
<h3>The Research Methods of History (5) Lan Wu Jing</h3>
<p>A. Discovery of Ape-Men. In 1918, the Swedish man Anderson went to Zhoukoudian, Beijing, to investigate. In 1921, Shidanski helped Anderson to excavate. In 1923, a piece of jawbone was discovered. In 1926, two human teeth were found, one upper molar and one lower premolar. In 1929, an ape-man bone was found. Pei Wenzhong estimated it to be a female skull. At that time, Dr. Glib named it "Peking Man". Later, after comparative research by Dr. Butasz, it was identified as "Chinese Ape-Man of the Peking species", confirming it as a human being between modern humans and "apes". As for the era of its existence, it was in the Old Ice Age. Anderson believed that it was earlier than the previously discovered humans, Erect Ape-Man, Heidelberg Man, and Dawson Man in the world. They lived in caves and knew how to use fire, stone tools, and bone horns. They are the ancestors of the Chinese people. The throne of Pangu should be given to him. According to experts, it was about 400,000 to 500,000 years ago, or about one million years ago. Before other humans were discovered, it could also be said to be the ancestors of humans in the world. The old saying that the origin of the Chinese nation came from the East is self-defeating.</p>
<p>B. Determination of the Stone Age. Human evolution has progressed from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, and then to the Iron Age. This statement is not accepted by those who entrusted the ancients to reform the system. However, facts speak louder than words. The determination of the Stone Age in China is also a major discovery by archaeologists. The Old and New Stone Ages are described below.</p>
<p>(A) Discovery of the Old Stone Age</p>
<p>In the summer of 1925, the American Central Asia Expedition, under the guidance of Nelson, discovered rock fragments in Aro Nor, Mongolia, that were similar to humans. In the autumn of 1923, Fader Rizhen and Gong Sang Yizhihua discovered stone tools in Youfangtou, Yulin County, Shaanxi, mostly made of coal. In Ningsha County, Ningxia, there were hundreds of stone tools in the Donggou south of Ningsha County. The Sarawusu Gully in southeastern Ordos discovered extremely rich broken bones and a tooth, which can be regarded as the first discovery of Old Stone Age human bones in Asia.</p>
<p>Other stone tools have been discovered in the Gobi Desert and Zhoukoudian. The period they experienced was about 20,000 to 30,000 years, before the beginning of the New Stone Age.</p>
<p>(B) Discovery of the New Stone Age</p>
<p>In the summer of 1921, Anderson unearthed relics in Shaguotun, Jinxi County, Liaoning: (1) stone tools, (2) pottery, (3) miscellaneous tools, (4) bones. In the winter of the previous year, he obtained stone axes, knives, stone pestles, stone arrowheads, etc. in Yangshao Village, Mianchi County, western Henan. In 1923 and 1924, relics from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages were discovered in various parts of Gansu, divided into six periods. Using the names of the places where they were obtained, they were called the "Qijia Period", the "Yangshao Period" (or thought to be the Xia Dynasty or the Xia clan era), the "Machang Period", the "Xindian Period", the "Siwa Period", and the "Shajing Period". The first three periods were the Neolithic period, and the last three periods were the early Bronze Age. Each period averaged about 300 years. Gansu culture may have originated around 3500 BC and ended around 1700 BC.</p>
<p>Other Neolithic relics have been discovered in Xiyin Village in Xia County, Shanxi, Chengzhiya in Longshan Town, Jinan, Shandong, the Liaodong Peninsula, Rehe, Heilongjiang, Ang'angxi, and Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Accepting the Gifts of Civilization</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>Who in the world does not cherish their own life?</p>
<p>In order to save lives, scientists and medical professionals have spent countless efforts, time, and energy in laboratories, consuming much energy and life. Their sacrifices are great, but their efforts are not in vain.</p>
<p>Since Pasteur invented vaccination, and the medical community subsequently invented vaccinations, countless precious lives have been saved. This is a true gift of human civilization! These gifts, conveniences, and safeguards are given to us freely. The crowd is the target of scientists' efforts. As long as humans can receive these gifts, they will be satisfied, and they will not ask us for any price in return.</p>
<p>However, the world is truly full of wonders. White-coated people serving the public give free vaccinations on the road, yet many people detour and flee, avoiding them as if they were plagues. Hospitals are everywhere, and doctors are everywhere, but they refuse to get vaccinated. They are afraid of pain, they are afraid of mild fever, they are afraid of arm soreness and swelling, and they think that vaccinations are superfluous. They are unwilling to accept the gifts of the great servants of humanity.</p>
<p>If Pasteur knew this in the afterlife, I wonder what he would think?</p>
<p>Even if not for ourselves, then for the sake of public health, and to be a good example for other less knowledgeable members of society, we should all actively endure that momentary slight pain and accept this gift of civilization.</p>

<h3>I Love Beipei</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>Our group is mobile, so we have traveled all over Sichuan, but we spend most of our time in Beipei.</p>
<p>Beipei, I just love this place. It's like Jiangwan in Shanghai, plain but charming and forthright! People who are used to living in Chongqing will feel an intangible sense of joy when they stay here for a while!</p>
<p>The current Beipei is no longer a concentration of doctors. Instead, the masters of the house are students full of vigor! From the Shandong natives who say "an zan" to the Guangdong girls who say "mou dong de", they are all digging into their future in books! Their spirit of hard work is enough to shame a group of people who hold foreign books as decorations?</p>
<p>Speaking of "foreign books," it is a very unfamiliar name in the inland. Textbooks above the high school level are all made of local paper lecture notes. Not only is it local paper, but the ink is also made of local smoke. It is already quite impressive to have a few broken dictionaries standing on the bookshelf. The standard of living is no lower than that of Chongqing; rice is 400 yuan per stone, meat is three yuan per catty, and eggs have also risen to three cents apiece. Therefore, money cannot be spent casually, be careful your stomach will be growling!</p>
<p>It is indeed quite bitter, but no one can be found to "complain" about the bitterness. "Bitterness" has created a strong and unyielding will, so "bitterness" does not need to be a sigh in the mouth!</p>
<p>A new friend from the north told me!</p>
<p>"The eyebrows of Tianjin people are in the shape of an 'eight', the eyebrows of Shanghai people are in the shape of a 'one', but the eyebrows of Chongqing people are in the shape of an 'O'."</p>
<p>Her meaning: what is seen in Tianjin is a crying face, Shanghai is a sad face, but Chongqing is a smiling face - not only a smiling face, but also a face full of energy!</p>
<p>Indeed, not only Chongqing, Beipei, but the entire inland shows cheerfulness! Determination! Proactiveness!</p>
<p>"Don't let yourself go"! It is not a slogan, it is not an IOU, it is action!</p>
<p>My work is so busy that it is okay, but it is generally happy! It feels at least a bit honorable to treat the glorious warriors. When they tell some stories about the front line, it makes our hearts active.</p>
<p>One thing is peculiar, so peculiar that the American doctors with us give us a thumbs up!</p>
<p>That is, not a single wounded soldier is "decadent". Their evaluation of the other side is invariably inseparable from the three words "not worth mentioning"!</p>
<p>If you ask me about the two words "grasp", I think this "not worth mentioning" is enough to symbolize it, right? In short, with the progress of time and space, belief has become a tightly clenched old fist.</p>
<p>We are waiting to see the power exerted by this old fist!</p>

<h3>Musicians of Nature</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shui</p>
<p>The parks are full of flowers and green grass. Undoubtedly, we know: "It's time for the birds to sing again." But here, I want to ask you readers to pay attention. The musicians of nature are not just these birds: in addition, there are insects, frogs, toads, and the like, who are also famous "Beethovens" and "Mozarts" in nature.</p>
<p>Among insects, the most famous musician is the cicada. They have a very strange sound-producing organ. What's even stranger is that only male cicadas have this organ, while female cicadas do not. So many people say: "This is because the cicada brother sings too well, so he is given a mute wife, otherwise, wouldn't he be even more envied by people?" Poor thing, the belly of the female cicada is only a little sharper than that of the male cicada, and she can only be "mute". As for their children—larvae—they live in very deep basements, using tree roots as food. Their children are different from other people's children in that they have to live in an underground vault for a long time. In the United States, there is a type of cicada that must be 17 years old before it is allowed to go out. The sound-producing organ of the male cicada is a pair of drum-like membranes located under the abdomen. Due to the vibration of powerful muscles, when the membrane is stimulated, the sound is emitted. It is said that their motivation for singing is to attract partners of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>There is another type of insect musician - the grasshopper. They specialize in holding concerts in the evening. The ladies and misses put on bright green clothes, which are shining with white pear-like spots. When matched with beautiful pink edges, they are really tempting.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a type of frog. According to people who are familiar with them, "their singing is purely for fun, so they still like to sing in June and July." Inside the mouth of the frog, there is a pair of air sacs. When breathing, air is forced in from the nostrils, so the reverberation is particularly large. If dozens or hundreds of frogs sing a grand ensemble, their voices will be heard even a mile away. These scales are not only their instruments, but also the bedrooms for their children—tadpoles. The musicians of nature are really more than just these few, please discover them at any time.</p>
<h3>New Method for Quitting Alcohol (Revised)</h3>
<p>Two doctors in New York have invented a scientific method for quitting alcohol, which is said to be very effective and worth introducing. The two doctors inject an emetic drug into the bodies of alcoholics, and then ask them to sit in a luxuriously decorated bar. After the drug takes effect, the doctors ask them to drink as much as possible, cup after cup, until the drug stops working. This method was implemented for a week, and as a result, those alcoholics no longer needed to be injected with drugs, and they wanted to vomit when they saw wine bottles, thus giving up the habit of harming their minds and wasting money.</p>

<h3>Gas Mask for Mothers and Children</h3>
<p>— Shen Gang</p>
<p>In recent years, someone invented a gas mask that can be used by both mother and child. The baby is placed in an airtight oval bag, and the mother wears the gas mask. Because the breathing equipment is arranged very cleverly, the mother inhales air into the air chamber, which is not only enough for her own use, but also for her child. Because the baby's breathing is usually very weak, it cannot move the piston to inhale fresh air into the lungs. Therefore, this new type of gas mask is really beneficial to the "future masters".</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>11. Midnight Song</p>
<p>For dozens of days, because she often came and went to the Wu family, Meng's daughter-in-law had also gained some understanding of Qiu Haitang's strange habit of not being willing to spend an extra penny for himself.</p>
<p>"I know this." She nodded with a smile. "In fact, why does the old man have to think so hard about money?"</p>
<p>As she grew older day by day, Mei Bao gradually understood her father's economic situation. The kind of idea she had before, thinking that her father's hard work and frugality was purely a fool, was no longer in her mind.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, you have a shop and do business, and the money can come back after it goes out; our family's situation is different." Mei Bao lowered her head and dusted off some of the dust that had just stained her blue cloth short coat with her fingers. "Only two or three months out of the year can we sell some wheat straw and beans, and receive very little money. For the remaining ten months, we simply send out silver dollars and banknotes. Do you think that can keep my father from worrying?"</p>
<p>This immediately suited Meng's daughter-in-law's taste; today, she had nothing to do at home and was feeling bored. In particular, that mouth that liked to talk the most was more uncomfortable than death when asked to keep it shut; now, Mei Bao's mention of family affairs immediately aroused her interest.</p>
<p>"In principle, our two families are close neighbors with doors facing each other, so we should be more affectionate than other families; but it's funny to say, our masters and my father-in-law are busy doing business all day long, so they have never been close to your father, and everyone seems very estranged..." Her fluent and clear voice sounded like the most annoying firefly in Mei Bao's ears. "It's rare that you don't treat me as an outsider, and you tell me everything, so I'll ask you impolitely. After all, how much land does your family have? Does your father have any business outside? In recent years, has the harvest from the fields been able to cover the family's expenses? Also, do you have any relatives elsewhere besides this Zhangshu Village?" (162)</p>

<h3>Diana Durbin Talks About Married Life</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Worth Reading for Those Who Want to Enjoy Family Happiness</p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Diana Durbin is now a married woman. Her marriage with Vaughan Paul was unanimously praised by fans as a "match made in heaven," wishing them a long and happy life together. Therefore, everyone is eager to know what her married life is like? Now, after being a bride for two months, she frankly spoke to all walks of life.</p>
<p>Couple Portrait. Above the piano in Durbin's sitting room hangs a colorful double photo. She is wearing a plain white shirt with a white ribbon on her brown hair. Vaughan is wearing a white shirt with black stripes and holds Durbin to his chest, proudly showing the posture of a husband. "This photo was taken a week before our wedding," she said, pointing to the photo.</p>
<p>Flowers. "He is not only a perfect husband," she said proudly, "but also a thoughtful lover. He never forgets my work schedule, our appointments, or the day we first met. He never forgets to send me flowers when it is time to send them. If I feel unwell, or he is busy with work and cannot accompany me on outings, he always chooses some high-quality flowers to comfort me."</p>
<p>Temperament. "He also pays great attention to appearance, even the smallest details are not neglected. He always stands up every time I enter the room, even if there are only two of us in the room. However, he sometimes gets annoyed for no reason. When this happens, I just leave him alone and don't pay attention to him. He will pace back and forth, even for half a day. If it's too long, I will stop him, and he will stop immediately. He also gets angry, but only for bigger things that would make anyone angry. He is not an impatient person and will never lose his temper over trivial matters. In fact, he rarely gets angry.</p>
<p>Considerate. "There is one thing that makes him unhappy, and that is when I make him wait for me to slowly dress up for a banquet. He feels that it is unreasonable for women to make men wait for them to put on makeup. He says that it is of course their right for women to spend a lot of time making themselves beautiful, and no one can interfere, but they should pay attention to the time and prepare in advance. They shouldn't make people wait temporarily.</p>
<p>Household Affairs. "He must have absolute control over everything in the house, and a family should of course be like this. He really takes over my housework, and he is in complete charge of hiring or firing servants. When we hold a banquet at home, he arranges the food and wine and discusses the program with me. He also manages the household accounts. He likes to organize everything in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Recreation. "He doesn't easily make friends, but if you make friends with him, he will be your lifelong friend, even if you commit a serious crime, he will not break off with you. Although he himself doesn't like to go to amusement places late at night, he knows that I sometimes like to go out and have fun, so he accompanies me and tries his best to make me have a happy and enjoyable time.</p>
<p>Service. "Of course, he doesn't object to my work. Because there are few household affairs, he also feels that it is better for me to have work outside than to be idle at home. But when we have children, he will no longer allow me to work outside. He clearly explained that at that time I should belong completely to the family and fulfill the responsibilities of a housewife.</p>
<p>From her words, it can be seen how much they love each other. They share the joy of leisure time and live an interesting and happy life. There are no quarrels, only that bright and enviable happiness. Indeed, they are truly a match made in heaven.</p>

<p>Hao Shouchen, the net performer, is known as the "yellow bell and great Lu". When he raises his voice and sings, everyone in the audience is shocked! His acting skills are of a great school, and Cao Cao's plays are unique in today's opera world; the role of Lu Zhishen is especially known as a "unique skill". Although his body is slightly fat, it is not enough to be a defect in a wise man. When Yang Xiaolou was alive, he relied on him as his right and left hand; after Xiaolou passed away, Hao had a sigh of "who can I compare with". He once took the lead in Pingzi and formed a troupe to perform. In recent years, he has intended to retire.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn in the Silver Screen</p>
<h3>Gold Star Withdraws from Datong, Joins Mei Cheng Collaboration; Guohua Courts Minhua, Seeks Jincheng Films</h3>
<p>— Bashi</p>
<p>In the post-war film scene, apart from the joke of the double production case last year when everyone rushed to film folk stories, everyone has traditionally adopted a Monroe Doctrine, with no major storms. However, in the past week, several film industry giants have been engaging in mutual disputes using political means. The companies involved include Gold Star, Guohua, Minhua, Datong, and Mei Cheng. The figures involved include Zhou Jianyun, Liu Zhonghao, Yan Heming, and Jin Xinmin, among others. The inner workings are complex, truly a chapter worth recording in the annals of the silver screen!</p>
<p>Here, the reporter stands on an objective position to report the news:</p>
<p>First, when Gold Star Company was founded, it rented the studio from Datong. However, Datong's studio was built with funds from Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua Company. Therefore, after the lease contract between Gold Star and Datong expired on June 15th, Liu Zhonghao stated that he would take it back for his own use and would not rent it to Gold Star for filming anymore. Zhou Jianyun, the person in charge of Gold Star, although having close ties with Datong, could do nothing and expressed acceptance, rushing to film "Gunfire in the Rainy Night" while looking for a new studio.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, at this time, internal disputes occurred within Gold Star, with six shareholders, including Zeng Wanpu, announcing their withdrawal. Naturally, this was a serious problem. Therefore, Liu Zhonghao discussed with Zhou Jianyun, willing to buy Zeng's shares, but demanding more than half, so that Gold Star could also be under Liu Zhonghao's control, and the problem of continuing to film at Datong could of course be solved. However, Zhou Jianyun refused.</p>
<p>Thus, the new shareholder of Gold Star was completely taken by Sheng Buhua. Sheng is a major businessman in Shanghai, and his influence immediately became vast. The problem of the studio was then negotiated with Yan Heming of Mei Cheng. After several negotiations, all problems were resolved. Gold Star joined Mei Cheng in cooperation from August 1st. However, Gold Star was forced to do so, but because Gold Star urgently needed to solve the studio problem, it had to accept.</p>
<p>After Gold Star withdrew from Datong Studio, friction arose between it and Guohua. Naturally, future productions would no longer be screened at Jincheng. Moreover, Sheng Buhua is also a major shareholder of Xinhua Grand Theater. There is no doubt that Gold Star's films will be obtained by Xinhua. Therefore, even if Liu Zhonghao's Guohua produces more films, they cannot be screened consecutively at both Jincheng and Jindu theaters. Thus, he visited Jin Xinmin, the owner of Minhua, hoping that Jin Xinmin would, from Minhua's position, refuse Gold Star's joining in August (Minhua often cooperates with Mei Cheng). However, Jin Xinmin felt that Minhua had very few actors and actresses, and delaying filming for two months was not a big deal, while Gold Star was different, so he did not agree. After Liu Zhonghao's first plan failed, he discussed cooperation with Jin Xinmin again. His purpose was nothing more than to ensure that if Jincheng and Jindu face a film shortage in the future, they could cooperate with Minhua, so that Minhua's productions could be screened at Jincheng and Jindu. Jin Xinmin is still considering whether Liu Zhonghao's second strategy will succeed.</p>
<p>Looking at the above situation, the atmosphere of strife is indeed very strong. Future developments remain to be proven by facts.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Ultimately, Ning Wu Can Do Nothing</p>
<p>Zhou Yuji knew he could not hold the city, looked up to the sky and sighed, and led two or three hundred of his trusted soldiers, along with Zhang Lie, down the city to meet the rebel soldiers and engage in street fighting with them. The bandit general Zuo Jinhu rode his horse to kill, wanting to capture Zhou Yuji to establish a great merit. Zhou Yuji wielded the gilded spear in his hand urgently. How could Zuo Jinyu be his opponent? In less than twenty rounds, Zhou Yuji stabbed him in the shoulder with one spear, knocking him off his saddle, and the rebel soldiers rescued him. When the bandit general Shetian rushed up, Zhou Yuji roared with angry eyes, his eyes almost bursting. Shetian dared not engage in battle and turned his horse to flee. When Zhou Yuji chased after him, he drew out the iron whip from his waist and struck him on the back, hitting Shetian so hard that he vomited blood and leaned on his saddle to flee. At this time, Li Chuang was riding his horse into the city, and when he heard that Zhou Yuji was still fighting like a trapped beast, he ordered his eight battle generals to fight together, determined to capture Zhou Yuji alive and reduce his family. Therefore, although Zhou Yuji killed dozens or hundreds of people, the bandits became more numerous the more they were killed, and surrounded him on all sides. He knew that there was no hope of survival, and he was willing to sacrifice himself to achieve righteousness, leaving righteousness in the world, only seeking to kill more bandits and obtain a significant price. Zhang Lie also followed his master, fighting desperately. The two of them killed crazily, blood flowing over their robes and armor, and they were both wounded in several places, and their subordinate soldiers were almost completely dead. The bandits were somewhat frightened by the ferocity of the two. One bandit general, confident in his bravery, raised his great axe and came to fight Yuji. Zhou Yuji used all his strength in both arms, and with a series of fierce spear thrusts, forced him to retreat in disarray. Zhou Yuji thrust his spear to pursue, but unexpectedly the warhorse he was riding was exhausted and suddenly collapsed, kneeling on the ground and throwing Zhou Yuji off his saddle. The bandit general was overjoyed and was about to turn his horse's head to capture Yuji when Zhou Yuji roared like a tiger and leaped up from the ground, sweeping his whip, reversing the situation and striking the bandit general, causing his brains to burst and die. When another bandit general charged, Zhang Lie chopped off half of his head with a single blow from behind. With the death of two generals in a row, the bandits were even more shocked and retreated one after another. Zhou Yuji was still thinking about his old mother, wife, and children at home, so he and Zhang Lie, along with seven or eight wounded soldiers, rushed out of the alley and killed their way to their own home. Li Zicheng heard that Zhou Yuji was so brave that it was difficult to capture him by force, fearing that he would escape, so he ordered the archers to release their arrows. At this time, there were bandits on both sides of the houses, and Zhou Yuji saw them clearly. Everyone drew their bows and released their arrows, and the arrows flew like locusts, flying towards Zhou Yuji's side. Zhou Yuji threw away his spear, wielding his iron whip, leaping and dodging on foot, killing dozens of people with his bare hands. The shadow of the whip flew horizontally, and many arrowheads fell to the ground and piled up. (119)</p>
