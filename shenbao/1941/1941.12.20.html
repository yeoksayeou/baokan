<p>本市米號公會現與兩租界當局磋商、擬於短　　內、改善各米號領售棧有洋米手續、俾普遍發售、而安人心、過去兩週間、因米號領售俴米無確切時間、以致雖　登記、但無法按時領得、屢次發生缺米情形、倘領米辦法若能正式商定、則米號售米可吿無虞中斷、</p>
<p>昨售米量較為增加</p>
<p>工部局洋米辦事處撥各米號向厦門路信源棧搬運之米、各米號昨日次第提到、故於午後已出售、以應零雜平民之需要、因出售洋米之米店、家數已多、故擁擠情形已减、米糧辦事處、昨日仍繼續發給各申請米號之搬運許可證、其搬運之米、指定由茂泰棧及太古棧兩處提取、各米號申請人數殊衆、</p>
<p>駐公之不再發還</p>

<p>烘焙麵包</p>
<p>據餅乾糖果罐頭麵包業同業函稱、近來因麵粉供給不暢、不得已减少焙製數量、又因原料續漲、開支激增、造具成本表、迭派代表、向工部局請求重訂售價、以免虧本、間有一二廠家停業、因迫於麵粉告罄、無法购備所致、且亦得工部局之諒解、一俟用粉有着、亟須複業、與工部局規定售價問題、絲毫不涉、</p>

<h3>戲院更改時間之商榷</h3>
<p>— 王奇</p>
<p>本市各游藝塲，爲節省電費，以及夜問交通之不便，一致議決更改開演時間，提早散戲，現已大家實行此議。</p>
<p>專演平戲之舞臺，如黃金，更新，大舞臺，共舞臺，天蟾……原係每天祇演夜塲，大致七時開演，十一時半散塲，除逢星期六，日，始加日戲一，現在這幾家戲院，已提早由二時開　，演至夜間八時為止，跨白天而演到夜晚，足有六整小時之久，一般說來，時間放長，戯碼也隨之增加，當然受人歡迎，實則這時間定得不尷不尬，說日塲不是日塲，說夜塲不是夜塲，而普通說來，六時之後，正是夜飯時間，爲了看戲，夜飯就得丟開不吃，否則亦須肚皮受一點飢餓，延到散戯後再回來吃夜飯，眞有點令人吃不消，故各戲院所定的時間，實有商榷之必要。</p>
<p>夜飯問題之外，還得顧及交通問題，據公共車輛所定每日交通時間，現規定行駛四小時半，下午十二時半至一時半止及叫時半至六時半止，基此原則，各戲院開演時間亦以由一時至下午六時爲止最爲適富，非但午夜二餐不相衝突，目往戲院及妝戲時均有車可乘，較前定時間便利多矣。</p>
<p>現在各電影院同樣亦已改定了開映時間，且由每天四塲减爲三塲，不過，電影與平劇不同，每塲至多僅二小時，且電影院比平劇館爲多，更以地段之不同，故各院所定放映時間，尙未能完全一律，依筆者愚見，電影　塲之開映時間，以一時，四時及夜易六時半至八時半此三個時問爲宜，同時爲挹注所减去之一塲之營業損失計，嗣後早塲，除原定星期日外，星　星六亦不妨開映一塲，時間以十時半起映至十二時半爲止。</p>
<p>質諸戲院當局，其亦以鄙見爲然否？</p>
<h3>梨園瑣記</h3>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>第二十章　蠟炷迎來在戰塲</p>
<p>早有一個淸兵抓起那少婦跑到床邊去。只聽床上有老年婦人的聲音抖抖地哀求。以及少婦慘呼和抗拒的聲音。柳隱英實在忍不住了，拔出白龍寶劍一個箭步跳進房去。燈光下是那淸兵把刀插在床邊桌子上，正雙手摟着那少婦登床去褫伊的褻衣，想幹禽獸的勾當。床上有一個病容滿面的老婦，身子縮做一團，口裹不住的哀求。柳隱英已直奔淸兵背後，邊旁的淸兵一時不防，也沒有攔阻。柳隱英的寳劍，倏的向那淸兵頸上掃去，骨碌碌的一顆人頭已滾落床邊，屍首仰後而倒，鮮血滿地。老婦慘呼了一聲，昏暈過去。旁邊的淸兵突然聞見來了一個明將，砍死了他們的伙伴，如何不驚怒交加？大家立即舉起兵刃，和柳隱英猛撲。而許靖也已揮動赤鳳寳劍跳進房來，加入這個戰團。柳隱英寳劍的左右盤旋，又刺傷了一個淸兵的手臂，淸兵只得退出房去。大家在庭院中惡鬬，叮叮噹噹地一片刀劍聲。料這區區四個淸兵業已死一傷一，怎敵得過許靖柳隱央兩人？柳隱英一劍橫掃過去，又一淸兵已倒在血泊中。許靖見柳隱英連殺兩卒，他的勇氣亦不由陡增不少。（二四四）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Ongoing as Japanese Troops Land in Hong Kong Yesterday; Ten Chinese Divisions Gather Around Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters and the Navy Ministry jointly announced this morning at 6:55 a.m. that Japanese naval and land forces landed at three locations in northeastern Hong Kong last night and are advancing towards military zones.</p>
<p>Singapore, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Military authorities here today admitted that the situation in Hong Kong is serious. According to Reuters, fierce battles are taking place after Japanese troops landed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Havas) – Officials announced that as of 2:00 p.m. today, defending forces are still holding part of the port.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) – Deputy spokesman of the Japanese Information Department, Mr. Hori, criticized the heavy concentration of Chinese troops behind Hong Kong when he met with foreign journalists today, stating that it seems certain that ten divisions of Chinese troops led by General Yu Hanmou are gathered around Guangzhou, and there are several thousand irregular Chinese troops north of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Shortly after the Imperial General Headquarters confirmed the successful landing of Japanese troops in Hong Kong, it was learned here that part of the key areas of Hong Kong had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. After landing in Hong Kong early Friday morning, the Japanese army immediately occupied the surrounding areas of Hong Kong, including Victoria Peak, where British anti-aircraft artillery positions were located. According to another source, although British anti-aircraft fire was fierce, Japanese aircraft continued to bomb military targets in Hong Kong on Friday morning. Bombs landed on the cliffs near the Governor's Office and barracks. The British headquarters and other important buildings were bombed. From the air, the streets of Hong Kong were deserted, and the residents of Hong Kong had taken refuge indoors. Soldiers around the barracks and fortresses were clearly visible. Before the Japanese army landed in Hong Kong, there was a twelve-hour bombardment. When the Japanese army landed, the British army fired with machine guns, and then launched a bayonet fight. The Japanese army advanced step by step and finally captured the British fortress. At 9:50 p.m., the Japanese army released a signal indicating that the landing operation in Hong Kong had been successful.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – Hong Kong Governor and Commander of Hong Kong Forces, Sir Mark Young, replied to a letter from Colonial Secretary Lord Moyne on the 17th, stating, "I have received your transmission of His Majesty the King's remarks, and all personnel participating in the defense of Hong Kong are deeply moved. We will definitely persevere to the end."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – It was learned here today that Japanese troops have landed at three locations in Hong Kong. By 11:00 a.m. this morning, half of Hong Kong was under Japanese control. Qiaoting Mountain, 470 meters above sea level, has been occupied by the Japanese army, which can overlook the entire island. Several British troops are still trying to resist stubbornly, but it is only a local war. Japanese heavy artillery and aircraft are currently bombarding their resistance nests. It is said that the fortresses built in Hong Kong can only strike far out to sea and are not suitable for close combat. The Qiaoting Mountain occupied by the Japanese army is located in the center of the island, so the British defense system in that area has actually been broken through by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Official sources in London confirmed tonight that Japanese troops landed in Hong Kong today with powerful forces, and fierce battles are in progress. British officials admitted that the situation in Hong Kong is critical. The British Colonial Office denied that the Governor of Hong Kong has left the island. London also stated that there are not many troops stationed in Hong Kong, most of whom are Canadian troops, and the area they defend is very vast.</p>
<h3>British Forces Establish New Defense Line in Northeastern Malaya, Preparing for a Decisive Battle to Contain the Japanese Offensive; British Announce Withdrawal from Penang</h3>
<p>Singapore, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Military sources report that British Imperial forces have established a new defense line in northeastern Malaya and are fighting a decisive battle in the paddy fields in the hope of containing the Japanese offensive on the flank of the Penang naval base. This new defense line stretches from Ruila to Kelai. The main force of the defending army is the Indian army. In addition, the British military is quite confident in the resistance of the British army in the northwest of Kedah, where Japanese troops are threatening the town of Bedong. If the Japanese army occupies this town, it will be sufficient to attack Penang from the side.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Officials announced today that British troops have withdrawn from Penang.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, declared at the New Delhi intelligence conference yesterday that Britain has no ability to rescue Penang, but is now taking various measures to alleviate the serious situation in the Malay Peninsula. Penang is located near Kedah in the northwest of the Malay Peninsula, and Kedah is already in the hands of the Japanese army. George Town, the capital of Penang, has a population of approximately 170,000.</p>
<p>Singapore, 18th (United Press) – As of 10:30 a.m. this morning, Imperial troops in northeastern Malaya are holding the new position of Jitra. The army is mainly composed of Indian troops. Military personnel do not seem anxious about the advance of the Japanese army in the northeast region. It is said that the Japanese army lacks destructive offensive power, while the British Imperial army is prepared to launch it in the short term.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – The London Times wrote today about the Malayan war, stating that two strong Japanese armies have landed in Malaya and are advancing inland. However, once Penang falls into Japanese hands, the Japanese army will use it as a gateway to enter the Indian Ocean, and maritime traffic west of Singapore will be seriously threatened. The air force in Malaya should be strengthened. Hundreds of miles of land are mostly jungle. If the Japanese army advances, fierce battles will inevitably occur. However, if the defense of Singapore becomes passive, waiting for the Japanese to take the initiative to advance south, it would be a serious mistake. Whether fortresses and ports can be maintained depends on their offensive power. The Japanese army has bases in Thailand and Vietnam for attacking us. We should not only hold our positions but also eliminate Japanese power.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – A report received here this morning stated that Singapore authorities said last night that on the eleventh day after the outbreak of the Pacific War, British troops have been able to stop the Japanese advance on the western coast of Malaya and have greatly reduced the rate of the Japanese army's southward advance, which has penetrated 100 miles into Malaya from the Thai border. The Japanese army, which landed at Singora on the first day of the war, has recently received reinforcements, but so far the Japanese army in the area has not made significant progress. After the Japanese army advanced to the Songkhla River on the border between Kedah and Perak, it has isolated Penang and Wellesley Province from other British-controlled areas. Although the military importance of this second Malayan port has been lost, the Japanese army is still 300 miles away from its primary target, Singapore. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses when it advanced from Thailand to Kedah. The Japanese army has not defeated the British army in large-scale battles, but small groups of light tanks equipped with automatic weapons have been operating extensively. The forest areas have been extremely humid in recent days. After the Japanese air force heavily bombed Penang and nearby land areas last week, there has been no intense bombing activity. Although Singapore has issued air raid alerts many times since the 9th, no bombs have fallen.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – The British Information Department issued a statement stating that according to a telegram from Singapore, British residents of Selangor (in western Malaya) denied that the British authorities planned to evacuate women and children from there and Kuala Lumpur. On the contrary, the British government has urged the people to remain calm and persevere.</p>
<h3>Second Air Raid Alert in Manila; Iloilo City Bombed</h3>
<p>Manila, 19th (Havas News Agency) – An air raid alert was issued here at 12:35 p.m. today. Several Japanese bombers flew over the city and bombed Cavite Naval Base, but withdrew within minutes. A second alert was issued an hour later.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here this morning, Iloilo, the second largest city in the Philippines, was bombed by more than 30 Japanese aircraft at 10:00 p.m. last night, resulting in casualties and damage. Iloilo is located on Panay Island, approximately 180 miles south of Manila.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters issued an official report last night stating that the main force of the enemy army in the Philippines has been defeated, so the resistance encountered by the Japanese army is minimal. The Japanese troops landing in the southern part of Luzon Island are now pursuing the defeated army, and the Japanese Air Force has repeatedly bombed enemy airfields near Manila.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Attacks Pearl Harbor Using Midget Submarines</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from Washington, the Japanese Navy used midget submarines when attacking Pearl Harbor. After inspecting a captured submarine, the US Navy stated that the midget submarine is only 40 feet long and the observation tower is 5 feet high. It was apparently launched from a large warship 100 miles from Oahu Island and then advanced towards the target. The submarine is a streamlined vessel, manned by only two people. Examiners estimate that the submarine has a range of approximately 200 miles and is electrically powered. Its crew must sacrifice their lives to achieve the expected results.</p>

<h3>British Under-Secretary States Position on Thailand</h3>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) – British Under-Secretary Cadogan stated in the House of Commons today in response to a member's inquiry that regarding the establishment of an agreement between Japan and Thailand allowing Japanese troops to pass through Thai territory, there is no detailed information on the scope of the agreement. If the Thai army cooperates with Japan, Britain has no choice but to regard Thailand as an enemy. The British government has consulted with relevant governments, and in economic terms, Thailand has already been regarded as an occupied territory.</p>
<h3>Vichy Spain Maintains Neutrality</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Domei News Agency) – A telegram from Washington stated that French Ambassador to the United States, Henri-Haye, announced to the newspapers today that he had declared to US Under-Secretary of State Welles that the Vichy government maintains neutrality in the US-Japan war.</p>
<p>Madrid, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Today's official gazette carried a government decree stating that Spain maintains neutrality in the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in the Far East Conduct Large-Scale Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 19th (Domei News Agency) – An Associated Press dispatch from Washington relayed news from Chongqing stating that Soviet troops are conducting extensive exercises along the border between Siberia and Manchuria.</p>
<h3>US, Britain, and Soviet Union Prepare to Convene Allied Military Conference; Striving for Unified Military Command, Pooling Manpower and Resources for Joint Warfare</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed sources in Washington stated that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are preparing to convene an Allied military conference in Washington in January next year. Governments of all exiled European countries will send representatives to participate in the conference.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th (Reuters) – According to reliable sources, the anti-Axis countries will soon hold a conference here to coordinate all resources and manpower to facilitate combat.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th (Havas News Agency) – The issue of unified military command has recently been commented on by political figures here, who said that this is a prerequisite for successful combat. Only in this way can victory be achieved in the shortest possible time, and losses in manpower and material resources can be reduced to a minimum. The lessons learned from the last Great War can serve as proof. If the Allied Powers had not established a unified command early on, it would have been difficult to win. In the current war, it is necessary to strengthen the coordination of actions in military, naval, economic, and political aspects, because the Axis powers are united, strong, and able to respond quickly to situations, and are even more able to fight according to a general plan. However, this issue includes various fundamental issues, and in military terms alone, it is closely related to production issues. Therefore, a common policy should be determined, and any decision must be submitted to the heads of state of the relevant countries for consultation. However, at present, there is no unified agency for the military command of the United States and Britain. Whether in the United States or Britain, the army and navy are commanded separately and go their own way. In the United States, the air force is also commanded separately. Moreover, both the United States and Britain lack a chief of staff who can be fully trained and have rich experience in naval, land, and air warfare to lead the three services, just like Hitler commanding the German army. No matter how difficult this issue is, it will be resolved satisfactorily. Given President Roosevelt's prestige, it would be most appropriate for him to serve as chairman of the Supreme Military Council, as the Washington Post stated. Although the sacrifices made by the United States in the current war are smaller than those of Britain and the Soviet Union, the United States is the arsenal of democracy and is qualified to assume this responsibility. In addition, key figures from China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Canada in Washington will be able to overcome political and geographical obstacles and establish an Allied Supreme Military Council in Washington.</p>
<h3>US Army and Navy Leaders Hold Meeting at the White House</h3>

<p>Sydney, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Army Department recently announced that Lieutenant General Winter will replace General McLay and serve as Commander of the Australian Far East Forces, taking office tomorrow.

<h3>Soviet Troops in the Central Sector Recapture Aleksin; German Reinforcements Arrive in Mozhaisk to Resist; German Aircraft Bomb Soviet Troop Concentrations</h3>
<p>Moscow, 19th (TASS) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced on December 17 that the Red Army occupied the city of Aleksin. According to preliminary incomplete statistics, when occupying the city of Aleksin (west of Tula), our army captured the following spoils: 73 cannons, 6 tanks, 2 tankettes, 7 ammunition wagons, 265 cars, 16 motorcycles, 58 mortars, 56 machine guns, 17 automatic rifles, 897 rifles, more than 700,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 4,000 landmines, and 110 war horses. German troops left more than 1,000 wounded officers and soldiers in the battlefield around the city of Aleksin.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – German officials released the following supplementary war report to Haitong News Agency interviewers yesterday, stating that the German Air Force is extremely active on the Eastern Front. In the southern sector, many defensive works, supply depots, troop concentrations, coastal batteries, and airfield facilities were destroyed. Ships in the port of Sevastopol were also bombed. In the central sector, German aircraft targeted trucks, artillery batteries, anti-aircraft positions, and tanks, destroying 13 tanks and 200 trucks. Two stations on the Murmansk Railway were bombed. Soviet troops on the Finnish front attacked an airfield and suffered heavy damage.</p>
<p>Northwestern Front, 10th (TASS) – Since the enemy troops along the Tikhvin retreated along two parallel routes, there are many forests and swamps along the way. The wind and snow are heavy. The tank team led by Gavrilov set off to Village L to intercept the retreating German troops. Their actions were swift, and the German troops were surrounded. These fascists were pitifully wading through the snow in their clothes. Some of them held up white cloths and surrendered to the Soviet tanks. The German troops will obviously encounter the same fate as Napoleon's army. Along the way, the troops of the German General Schmidt abandoned many corpses and weapons, and their embarrassed situation is self-evident.</p>
<p>Kalinin, 19th (TASS) – A special correspondent of Pravda stated that after our army recaptured Kalinin, it continued to pursue the German army to the southwest. The fascist rearguard resisted stubbornly. In the past 24 hours, our army recaptured 18 more villages. The German army abandoned a large number of war materials.</p>
<p>Mozhaisk Area, 19th (TASS) – The Germans are fiercely resisting our advancing troops and are sending reinforcements to continue fighting.

<h3>Portugal Expresses Concern About the Occupation of Timor; Japan Says Relations with Portugal Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the occupation of Timor Island by the British-Dutch Allied forces, political figures here are extremely calm, saying that no matter what assurances the Portuguese government receives, it will never recognize the maintenance of that country's future sovereignty over the island. In short, this incident will inevitably cause serious repercussions in international politics. It is obvious that those responsible for this incident failed to anticipate in advance the serious consequences of occupying this small island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Although the Japanese government has not received an official report of the occupation of Timor Island by the Allied forces, Tokyo stated last night that Japanese-Portuguese relations remain unchanged. Portugal has always treated Japan with a friendly attitude, so after the occupation of Timor Island, Japan's attitude towards Portuguese Macau will not change.</p>

<h3>The Public's Need for Rice Remains Extremely Urgent; Rice Shops Must Sell Broadly; Yesterday's Rice Sales Increased Relatively; Procedures for Obtaining Rice from Warehouses Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The city's Rice Shop Guild is currently in negotiations with the authorities of the two foreign concessions to improve the procedures for all rice shops to obtain and sell foreign rice from warehouses within a short period, in order to reassure the public. In the past two weeks, because there was no fixed time for rice shops to obtain and sell allocated rice, even though people registered, they could not receive it on time, leading to repeated shortages. If the procedures for obtaining rice can be officially agreed upon, the sale of rice by rice shops can be guaranteed without interruption.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Rice Sales Increased Relatively</p>
<p>The foreign rice office of the Public Works Department allocated rice to various rice shops to be transported from the Xin Yuan Warehouse on Xiamen Road. The rice shops received the rice yesterday one after another, and it was sold in the afternoon to meet the needs of small retailers and ordinary people. As the number of rice shops selling foreign rice has increased, the crowding situation has decreased. The Rice and Grain Office continued to issue transport permits to rice shops that applied yesterday, designating the Mao Tai Warehouse and the Taikoo Warehouse as the places to pick up the rice. The number of applicants from various rice shops was very large.</p>
<p>Rice Confiscated by the Police Will Not Be Returned</p>
<p>Because some people inquired at the Rice and Grain Office, hoping to reclaim foreign rice that had been confiscated by the police for violations, the office issued a special notice stating, "All rice that has been confiscated by the police will not be returned. Rice and Grain Office Announcement." Therefore, the owners of the above-mentioned confiscated rice and grain need not inquire at the office again.</p>
<p>National Rice Shipped to Shanghai is Guaranteed</p>
<p>Shipping national rice to Shanghai is more convenient than in the past, so rice merchants are purchasing in large quantities to regulate the market on time. It is understood that the national rice that has been traded has been gradually shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that recently, about 1,500 bags are shipped to Shanghai every day. Statistics show that in the past few days, about 150,000 bags of rice and grain have been shipped to Shanghai, but purchasing remains difficult. At the same time, small-scale trafficking is also quite frequent, and the price per picul has fallen by about ten yuan.</p>
<p>Rice and Flour Freight</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently stipulated that the maximum freight for transporting rice or flour by truck or handcart is two yuan per bag of rice and five jiao per bag of flour. Any vehicle owner who refuses to transport rice or flour according to the above-mentioned freight rates will have their vehicles confiscated.</p>
<p>Baking Bread</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association, due to the recent disruption in the supply of flour, they have been forced to reduce the quantity of baking. Also, due to the continued rise in raw materials and the sharp increase in expenses, they have prepared a cost list and sent representatives to the Public Works Department to request a revision of the selling price to avoid losses. Occasionally, one or two factories have closed down because they were forced to run out of flour and could not purchase it. They have also obtained the understanding of the Public Works Department and will resume business as soon as flour is available. This has nothing to do with the selling price set by the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Public Warehouse Committee Dissolved</h3>
<p>Hoping That All Industries Will Promptly Recover Advance Payments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee, due to the issue of whether to continue or abolish the committee, held an inaugural meeting at the Public Works Department at 2:00 PM on the 9th of this month. It was unanimously resolved to dissolve the committee immediately, and all funds advanced by various industries and individuals for the committee will be returned in full. From the 10th to the 20th of this month, those with the committee's previous official receipts can go to the Fuyuan Money Exchange at 70 Ningbo Road to collect the full amount. It is understood that the committee hopes that all industries and individuals who advanced funds will promptly go to collect the money to complete the dissolution.</p>
<h3>Tram Service to Hongkou to Resume; Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of tram service between the Public Concession and the Hongkou district, it is understood that the Public Works Department has been negotiating with the Japanese side and has basically reached a decision. All the details are still under discussion, and the date of implementation has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Warehouse Unsealed Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the Taikoo Roosevelt warehouses were sealed, there was talk of opening them the day before yesterday. The situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is understood that the customers storing goods in the warehouses of the two companies had not completed the procedures for picking up their goods the day before yesterday, so they had not picked them up. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese military police opened the Taikoo Warehouses No. 13 and 14 on the Xin Kai River, and foreign rice and sugar were taken out, but the exact amount is unknown. The Roosevelt Warehouse was not seen to be opened yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Announcement: Taxes Must Still Be Paid; Strict Measures Will Be Taken Against Those Who Owe Taxes; Statement Issued by the Head of the Japanese Military News Department</h3>
<p>According to news from the Public Works Department, some citizens, given the current emergency situation, believe that there is no need to fulfill their obligations to pay taxes and fees to the bureau. The bureau specially issued a sincere announcement stating that although it is in an emergency situation, the bureau, at the request of the Japanese authorities and with their full cooperation, continues to perform its duties as usual and seeks welfare for the Public Concession. All citizens within the concession must promptly pay all kinds of taxes and fees to the bureau, and outstanding taxes must also be recovered. The bureau will take strict measures against those who owe taxes, not only prosecuting them according to law but also depriving them of the municipal benefits they should receive.</p>
<p>The head of the Japanese military news department issued a statement yesterday, saying that regarding the issue of tax payment by Chinese people in the Public Concession, the Public Works Department authorities have already issued a warning today. The Japanese military's entry into the concession this time has often led Chinese and foreigners in the concession to misunderstand the true intentions of the Japanese military and to despise the Public Works Department, disobey its orders, or even refuse to pay their taxes. Although the Japanese military has entered the concession this time, it is willing to respect administrative power and, to the extent possible, enable the Public Works Department's functions to operate smoothly as usual, except where necessary for the Japanese military. Therefore, if anyone violates the Public Works Department's orders or deliberately delays paying taxes, the Japanese military will do its utmost to assist the Public Works Department in taking action against such people. This is a special warning.</p>

<h3>Deposit and Withdrawal Procedures for Banks Will Change Soon; Ample Funds Should Be Available After HSBC Deposits Are Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The Japanese side has allowed the withdrawal of deposits from HSBC by various Chinese commercial banks. The procedure will be for HSBC to open an account with Yokohama Specie Bank as a transaction, and the Chinese commercial banks will then withdraw from Yokohama Specie Bank. It is understood that this matter is in progress and will be implemented soon. The circulation of finance in this city, the supply of funds, and the limits on deposits and withdrawals will improve.</p>
<p>As for the restrictions on deposits and withdrawals by HSBC, the most recent measures stipulate that British and American depositors can withdraw a maximum of 2,000 yuan from December 11 to December 22, but a maximum of 1,000 yuan from December 16 to December 22. Depositors of other nationalities can withdraw a maximum of 1,000 yuan from December 16 to December 22. The above measures apply equally to savings and demand deposits. Although many Chinese commercial banks have withdrawn funds since the 8th, they are restricted, and it is said that the total amount is about tens of millions of yuan, only about one or two percent of the total deposits.</p>
<p>In order to keep pace with various banks and money shops, the local Qian Dui Tong Ye (Money Exchange Association) has also changed its business hours, opening at the same time as other Chinese commercial banks and money shops. The business hours are now changed to opening at 10:00 AM and closing at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>The British, American, and Dutch banks will allow depositors to withdraw a total of 1,000 yuan in the week leading up to next Monday. Foreign banks other than British, American, and Dutch banks will have no restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. The withdrawal of salaries by employees of British, American, and Dutch banks is limited to 300 yuan per person in the first half of this month, and then temporarily limited to forty-odd yuan per person per week. This measure will be abolished from next Tuesday, and the Public Works Department will then announce new business measures for the banks.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has set the rice subsidy for Chinese employees in December at 52.50 yuan per person, it is said.</p>
<h3>Authorities Deny Purchasing All Cooking Oil</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that the report in today's (19th) newspaper that the authorities decided to purchase all cooking oil is not true, and the bureau has no intention of purchasing all cooking oil. This special announcement is made as above.</p>
<h3>Population Survey Under Preparation</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Price Control Committee, in view of the dense population of the city and the large-scale use of daily necessities, and because of international relations, the general wealthy class is using floating capital to purchase large quantities of daily necessities, attempting to illegally hide them. In order to crack down on this, there is a plan to distribute goods and grain according to the population. It is now planned to first survey the population within the concession. All measures are generally prepared, and No. 1 The Bund has been designated as the office, and it will start on a fixed date. In the future, if necessary, there will be a basis for action.</p>
<h3>Fuel Supply Shows Promise; Transport Permits Approved</h3>
<p>The city's coal briquette factories have agreed with the two concessions on a method for supplying coal briquettes to coal, firewood, and charcoal shops. The results of the registration of the industry have been reported to the two bureaus for review to facilitate the issuance of transport permits. The validity period of this permit is one week, and it must be renewed after the expiration date, otherwise, the right to transport will be revoked.</p>
<p>Electricity Company's Next Year's Budget</p>
<p>It is understood that the Leili Company's coal consumption has always been very large. Recently, due to the difficulty in obtaining supplies, it has been making every effort to economize and encourage users to cooperate and limit consumption in order to last. The company needs 40,000 to 50,000 tons of coal annually. The current situation is not good, so the total coal consumption for next year is planned to be reduced to more than 30,000 tons, but it still needs to be determined based on future circumstances, and there may be temporary changes.</p>
<p>Procedures for Applying for Transport Permits</p>
<p>For coal exceeding one luo (125 kg) or coal briquettes exceeding half a dan (25 kg), it has been approved to apply for a transport permit. If the consumption location of the coal or the destination to which it is transported is within the Public Concession, an application can be made to the Public Works Department, regardless of where the coal is stored. If the consumption location of the coal or the destination to which it is transported is within the French Concession, an application can be made to the Food and Price Management Section of the French Concession at 2 Fulvli Road. The fee for coal is four yuan per ton, and the fee for coal briquettes is two yuan per ton, or one jiao per dan.</p>
<h3>Water Chestnuts, Stockpiled Sugar, and Rice Confiscated by French Police</h3>
<p>For days, the French Concession Police Department has continued its investigation and search of residents and businesses in the concession for stockpiles of essential goods. Yesterday, police officers discovered that Tang Yunqing, the owner of the Ye Biji Tea Food Shop at 157 Mintiniyin Road, had a large amount of rice and sugar hidden on the second floor, so they sent personnel to search. As a result, 70 bags of rice and 50 bags of sugar were confiscated, and Tang was taken to the police department for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fire on Tongfu Road; Yaoming Shoe Polish Factory Destroyed</h3>
<p>The Yaoming Shoe Polish Factory at 33 Lane 23, Tongfu Road, Public Concession, suddenly caught fire at 3:18 PM yesterday. For a time, fierce smoke rose and the fire blazed, immediately piercing through the roof and becoming uncontrollable. After the fire brigade received the news, they rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which took a long time to extinguish.

It is also reported that when the fire started, two residents were burned.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Clearing and Cash Undecided; Futures Market Still Temporarily Suspended; Discount Varies From 3 to 8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news from various markets in this city: the cotton exchange had announced the resumption of business yesterday, but unexpectedly, the clearing and remittance between Chinese commercial banks and money shops and Japanese commercial banks caused some problems, resulting in inconvenience for brokers to collect and remit funds, so yesterday they still could not conduct auctions. They are currently trying to find a solution, so a temporary notice was issued suspending the market for two days. It is reported that more than a dozen banks and more than 20 money shops have agreed to cooperate and will officially start the auction next Monday (22nd). The gray market for gold yarn, government bonds, etc., was active. The discount on clearing bills was quite stable yesterday, with a discount price of 3 to 8 yuan per thousand yuan, up one yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hoarding Gold Causes Anxiety; Rushing to Sell; Plunging by 1,100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cash is scarce, and the fall is unstoppable. The opening price this morning was already as low as 13,000 yuan. First, Danji of Jiuchu Xianji offered 10 taels, and a certain gold shop offered Gonghe 10 taels, priced at 12,900 yuan. A certain gold shop then offered Yangqinghe 10 taels, retreating to 12,700 yuan. One side then re-entered Xintianbao 10 taels, priced at 12,600 yuan, and upon hearing unfavorable rumors, the decline intensified. Money shops and collectors were greatly anxious, and real goods were sold off. More than a hundred taels were subsequently traded, and the price fell sharply by another 400 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 10 taels from a customer, priced at 12,200 yuan. At noon, it rebounded slightly to 12,350 yuan, but then fell back again. There was even less improvement in the afternoon, and it fell further to 12,200 yuan with no buyers. Compared with the previous day, it fell sharply by 1,100 yuan, and the transaction price for the whole day differed by 700 yuan. Decorated gold, Daxiin and his colleagues hung at a small 50 yuan around 11 o'clock, and at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the fork was 50 yuan lower, (per tael) sold at 1,350 yuan, and collected about 1,100 yuan. Silver was sold at 20 yuan, and the black market was 12-13 yuan, rebounding slightly.</p>
<p>The military ticket market did not resume business yesterday. The asking price outside the market was still 3.70 yuan for purchase, and the selling price was 3.90 yuan. US dollar tickets continued to weaken, with sellers at 19.5 yuan and buyers starting at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Sale of Rice Opened; More Rice Selling Locations; National Rice Down About 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market showed a lively atmosphere. Because the public sale of foreign rice was opened, and the price was increased by two yuan, people's hearts were stable, and small bargain prices were also close to the new limited price. National rice was constantly being touted along the way. It is said that after the arrival of Wu Xian rice one after another, rice prices in the suburbs have also returned to level, and if a large amount of Wu Xian rice comes to Shanghai, white rice can gradually be shipped to Shanghai. More than 200 bags were reported to the market yesterday, and transactions were officially opened, but the market price has fallen by about 10 yuan. Early indica rice was 270 yuan in the morning market and only 260 yuan in the afternoon market. Northern japonica rice was 272 yuan, and early indica rice was 265 yuan. The afternoon market is still looking small, and more than 100 bags have been traded. The asking prices of porters are also falling accordingly, with each dou now only 24-25 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour is still difficult to develop, and wheat bran will also be controlled. There were no transactions yesterday. However, it was heard that the asking price for wheat bran has been reduced by several yuan. Wheat still needs 75 yuan, but there is a shortage of storage, and it has the appearance of being available at a price but unavailable.</p>
<p>Regarding the edible oil problem, it was heard yesterday that most of it has been purchased by the Shanghai Oil Distribution Office, which is mainly organized by the Japanese military. Only a small amount is circulating in the market, and the market is generally slightly weak. Soybeans, corn, etc. are also in a soft state. It is calculated that 1,000 cans of Jiangbei raw oil are priced at 350 yuan, 300 dan of Dayou Factory clear oil are priced at 238 yuan to 234 yuan, and 200 dan of rapeseed oil are priced at 244 yuan. 40 bags of Wuhu corn are priced at 52 yuan, 160 bags of Saigon new corn are priced at 53.5 yuan delivered by Peidong Warehouse, Fork Puxi 交 paid 55 yuan 100 bags of Dutch white corn, priced at 52 yuan, and more than 200 bags of Tianjin new Jinyuan, priced at 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shuangma Settlement Price Under Discussion</h3>
<p>The single market situation of Shuangma Factory is relatively weak. Someone tried to sell at 1,925 yuan, but the transaction was not completed. However, the sales in French Concession door shops are still quite good. Japanese factories ship goods as usual. Regarding the issue of the settlement price of the Bianma Exchange, the two sides are still in separate negotiations. It is heard every day that people outside the market are willing to settle at 2,190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Many Government Bonds Still in Account</h3>
<p>There are still settlement transactions outside the government bond market, which shows that the number of accounts is still large. After all, which of the hundreds of companies does not have account transactions, with a small amount of 180,000 and a large amount of more than a hundred million. Although there are transactions, they are not enough to clear them. Small banks also sell positions, but there are also buyers. The temporary meeting place is only in one corner, and the meeting time is extremely short. In the afternoon, they are gone with the wind. Yesterday's transactions were mostly sales. The first transaction price for Type C was 64 yuan and 8 jiao. After that, the price gradually decreased due to the prevalence of sellers. The minimum price was 64 yuan with 5,000 transactions, but it was a 100 yuan ticket. The final market was slightly firm. The first transaction for Type A was 70 yuan and 05, and after entering, 70 yuan could not be sold. The first transaction for Type E was 63 yuan and 3 jiao, and after entering, it was only 63 yuan, which shows that the market is not easy to be optimistic about. Type E should have been drawn on the 8th but it was not held. It is a pity that the Fund Management Committee has not made a statement to this day. The Yihe Yarn Factory, which rose to 35 yuan and traded on the previous day in the Zhngye Public Office stock market, suddenly fell back to 30 yuan yesterday with sellers, and entrants also paid 28 yuan. Jardine Matheson's price was between 60 and 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dutch Red Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Because most of the Dutch Red is stored in foreign warehouses and has been sealed, although it has been registered, it cannot be released, so the market storage is extremely short and the trend is very tight. Scattered sales are going on in this street, and the price is very close to that of white sugar.</p>
<h3>Golden Vegetables Continue to Loosen</h3>
<p>Because the shipping routes for the Nanyang and Hong Kong gangs of Golden Vegetables are blocked, the price has fallen, so although the arrival of goods is scarce, there is still a continued shadow. Recently, only the Wintai and Taiwan gangs have slightly purchased, with a price of about 200 yuan. Most of the commodity goods are in the bank warehouse and cannot be delivered, and there is also a lack of opening, the trend is flat and soft, and it is temporarily difficult to report.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes, Candles, and Soap Are Stagnant</h3>
<p>The buying of cigarettes is weakening, because the shipping routes for guest gangs have become narrower, so there is little interest in this street, and the supply exceeds the demand. The quoted price is 3,600 yuan for the British brand, 3,400 yuan for the old brand, 2,400 yuan for the Pinhai brand, 1,400 yuan for the Wuhua brand, 800 yuan for 10 schools of Daqianmen per 10,000, 780 yuan for 10-pack Daqianmen, and the price of 50,000 sticks is 100 yuan to 200 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Matches and soap are stagnant. Phoenix brand is 1,450 yuan, Rose brand is 1,470 yuan, Baixiangmao soap is 69 yuan, and Guben Pi soap is 87 yuan. The actual sales of foreign candles are still ongoing, because the Japanese authorities restrict the number of stocks, so people are eager to get them out of the cage, and the purchase price has dropped by as much as 6 yuan. The Sailboat brand is priced at 44 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Another Change in Woolen Cloth Shops</h3>
<p>Woolen cloth import foreign firms are mostly famous for British and American merchants. The situation has changed drastically, and warehouses have been checked and sealed, and even writing rooms are often inspected. Goods stored in foreign warehouses by shop families are also closed together, and business has mostly stopped. Most foreign firms are now changing to Chinese trademarks. If there is a Chinese firm that has friendship with Japanese firms, and its name is a British merchant, if it has not been checked and sealed, it will send the freight car to be stored on its behalf. There are many people like this.</p>
<h3>Tea (6)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The Yuan people, prosperous and encompassing Europe and Asia, with post roads crisscrossing and transportation unobstructed, tea leaves perhaps had the possibility of being imported into Europe, but it is also impossible to obtain concrete proof from historical records. The Venetian Marco Polo served as an official in China for nearly 20 years during the reign of Emperor Shizu of Yuan, and his travels covered almost the entire country, but in his travelogues he could only see a few specialties such as silk and sugar, and there was no mention of tea, which was already well known at that time and had truly become one of the seven things to start the day. (?) According to Feng Chengjun's translation of Marco Polo's Travels, the footnote under Chapter 100, "The Wine Drunk by the Khitans," states, "The custom of drinking tea had been popular for a long time at that time, but Marco Polo did not mention it, probably because he was influenced by the habits of the Mongols, who only drank horse wine and other fermented beverages." However, in 1559 AD, the Venetian Ramusio first made a note of tea, and in 1567 AD, the Russian Petroff and others introduced tea leaves to Russia, which can probably be regarded as the earliest tea leaves imported into Europe.</p>

<p>Arts and Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>Deliberation on Changing Theater Hours</h3>
<p>— Wang Qi</p>
<p>All the entertainment venues in this city, in order to save electricity costs and the inconvenience of night traffic, unanimously resolved to change the opening hours and end the shows earlier. This proposal has now been implemented by everyone.</p>
<p>Stages that specialize in ordinary plays, such as the Golden, Renewal, Grand Stage, Public Stage, Tianchan... originally only performed evening shows every day, generally opening at 7:00 PM and closing at 11:30 PM, except on Saturdays and Sundays, when day shows were added. Now these theaters have advanced the opening time to 2:00 PM and will perform until 8:00 PM at night, crossing from day to night, for as long as six full hours. Generally speaking, with the time lengthened, the program will also increase accordingly, which is of course welcome, but in fact this time is set neither here nor there, neither a day show nor a night show. Generally speaking, after 6:00 PM, it is dinner time, and in order to watch the show, dinner has to be put aside and not eaten, or else one has to endure a bit of hunger and wait until after the show to come back to eat dinner, which is really a bit unbearable. Therefore, the time set by the theaters really needs to be deliberated.</p>
<p>In addition to the dinner problem, the traffic problem must also be taken into account. According to the daily traffic hours set by public transportation, it is now stipulated to run for four and a half hours, from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM and from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Based on this principle, the opening hours of each theater should be from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is the most appropriate. Not only will the two meals, lunch and dinner, not conflict, but there will also be cars to take when going to the theater and after the show, which is much more convenient than the previous set time.</p>
<p>Now all the cinemas have also changed the showtimes, and reduced from four shows a day to three shows. However, movies are different from ordinary dramas, each show lasts at most only two hours, and there are more cinemas than ordinary drama theaters, and because of the different locations, the showtimes set by each cinema have not been completely uniform. In my humble opinion, the opening hours of each movie should be 1:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM, which are three appropriate times. At the same time, in order to make up for the business loss of one show that has been reduced, in the future, in addition to the originally scheduled Sundays, it is also possible to open a show on Saturdays, starting at 10:30 AM and ending at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>I ask the theater authorities, do they also think my humble opinion is correct?</p>
<h3>Trivial Notes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>When the Golden Grand Theatre hires Ma Yunliang to come south next year, it will also invite Kun Dan (female role in Peking opera) Zhang Yunyan to partner with him. Ma Zhizhong is currently in negotiations. Once the agreement is obtained from his teacher, the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing, there should be no problems.</p>
<p>Kun Dan Bi Yuzhen returned to　via the Ningbo Maru a few days ago. After a short rest, she will join the Qiankun Theatre at the Great World.</p>
<p>The Tianchan Stage authorities received a letter from Qin Kunshan, the owner of the Hongchun Troupe, stating that the troupe will hold a farewell performance in Tianjin on the fifth of next month. They will set off for Ningbo on the fifth, perform for half a month, and then come to Shanghai to perform.</p>
<p>Kun Jiao (female role) Xu Sheng (male role) Zhang Wenjuan is scheduled to return to　today by car.</p>
<p>Art World will publish　the Art World Third Annual Edition. After two months of preparation, it has been fully printed and will be published on Christmas Day. The content will be a comprehensive publication of film, drama, music, and refined recreational activities. All are written by various experts, and the selection of materials is extremely careful. The cover is in a three-color edition, with more than ten copperplate illustrations. It is magnificent and splendid. The price for one thick volume is one yuan, and it is distributed by China Book and Magazine Company.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama and Art Society　Suddenly Announces Dissolution</h3>
<p>— Yi Tong</p>
<p>Following the disbandment of the Shanghai Professional Troupe, the Shanghai Drama and Art Society, which has dominated the Shanghai theater scene for three years, has now also decided to dissolve. They are currently busy wrapping up unfinished business. The members are reluctantly saying goodbye, and the atmosphere feels quite bleak. It is truly another unfortunate piece of news for the Shanghai theater scene.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20 Wax Candles Welcome the Battlefield</p>
<p>An Qing soldier grabbed the young woman and ran to the bedside. The trembling voice of an elderly woman could be heard pleading from the bed, along with the young woman's screams and sounds of resistance. Liu Yinying couldn't bear it any longer. He drew his White Dragon Sword and leaped into the room. Under the lamplight, the Qing soldier had stuck his knife on the table beside the bed and was embracing the young woman with both hands, climbing onto the bed to strip her of her undergarments, intending to commit a beastly act. On the bed was an old woman with a sickly face, curled up in a ball, incessantly pleading. Liu Yinying had already rushed behind the Qing soldier. The Qing soldiers on the side were caught off guard and did not stop him. Liu Yinying's sword swiftly swept towards the Qing soldier's neck, and with a thud, a human head rolled to the edge of the bed. The corpse fell backward, and blood was everywhere. The old woman screamed and fainted. The Qing soldiers nearby suddenly heard that a Ming general had arrived and killed their comrade. How could they not be shocked and enraged? Everyone immediately raised their weapons and pounced on Liu Yinying. Xu Jing also swung his Crimson Phoenix Sword, jumped into the room, and joined the battle. Liu Yinying's sword circled left and right, also wounding a Qing soldier's arm, and the Qing soldier had to retreat from the room. Everyone fought fiercely in the courtyard, with the clanging of swords and weapons filling the air. Considering that these mere four Qing soldiers had already suffered one death and one injury, how could they withstand Liu Yinying and Xu Jing? Liu Yinying swept his sword horizontally, and another Qing soldier fell into a pool of blood. Seeing Liu Yinying kill two soldiers in a row, Xu Jing's courage also increased greatly. (244)</p>
