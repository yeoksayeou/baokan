<p>社評</p>
<h3>英美與遠東</h3>
<p>西方民治列强對遠東的關切，最近確是達到歷史上空前的程度。英國戰事內閣於八月廿六日派特夫古柏爲特別代表前來遠東，考察是吾有在新加坡設置戰時內閣機關的必要，月餘以來，他不斷僕僕風塵於馬來菲島緬甸印度之間，作種種重耍的接洽和視察，並曾於本月初間在新召集會議，與會者有英遠東軍總司令樸芳，海峽殖民地總督湯瑪斯，駐華艦隊司令萊頓，駐華大使寇爾，駐泰大使克勞斯倍，和澳洲商相佩奇，這一會議的重大性質，是不難從與會的人物得到相當槪念的。此外在財政經濟方面英倫銀行總裁聶梅雅，美國財長的技術輔助員高克蘭，均於九月秒由美飛來遠東，協助中國解決財政問題；同時前來遠東調查經濟情形的美助理國務卿則已於二日前飛抵中國陪都，受中國朝野的熱烈歡迎，並將於今日赴港與聶高二氏一同參加在港召集的三國財政會議。而尤其値得重視者，則爲遠東的英美軍事領袖，如英美的遠東軍總司令樸芳及麥克奧特，美遠東艦隊總司令赫德，美方派來中國的軍事代表團馬格魯特等三代表，於前昨兩日正齊集馬尼刺，從事重要討論。雖事關軍事機密，外間無由知悉詳情，但據樸芳所表示此次會議範圍之廣爲向所未有一語看來，可斷言其必與在發展中的遠東現局息息相關，並爲ABCD陣綫在遠東軍事合作的具體商討，而如何使英美援華物資能確切迅速交付中國，則更經明白表示爲此一會議重耍議題之一。最近的中國。已以湘北鏖戰的大捷表現其決不辜負全世界正義人士的期許，確可以負起遠東反侵略戰爭獨當一面的重任而無愧。以是雖然連日蘇德戰事復趨熾烈，南大西洋的美油船也續遭納粹毒手，初禾能轉移此人對於遠東的興趣和注視。</p>
<p>前此的日本，曾不斷以遭受包圍爲言，其實那只是其準備從事擴展的藉口，彼時民治各國之在遠東，確是暴露在孤立無備狀態之下的。英美的遠東防務固在不斷增强之中，但却缺乏有計畫的聯合行動，允其是對於正在對日苦戰的中國，一向沒有取得必要的聯繫。三國同盟成立後，英美始進而考慮到遠東方面的應變準備，其入於具體的措施，則爲今夏日本進兵越南以後的事。局勢發展至此，日本已達到其和平南進的最大限度，其在戰略上固已攫得進退自如的便利，却顯然絕不足以應付ABCD實力的總和，是以乃有最近兩月以來的猶豫和持重，另一方面則以對美進行談判作解除經濟重壓的嘗試。這是以退爲進，也是期待着對華戰爭的解決與蘇德戰事的最後分曉，但是就一般趨勢看來，日本業已處於類似窒息的境地當中，其實力也只有消耗和減弱，儘管把一切可能的經濟動員計畫都付諸實施亦難望有顯著的改善；至於遠東ABCD陣綫的實力，則正在積極增强之中，並將隨美國租借法案與國防程序的推進而益見强化。如果說擊潰軸心應該先由其最弱的一環下手，最近的遠東恰好符合這種條件。</p>
<p>在民治列强，其對於遠東的關切和準備固都達到最高限度，而其視擊敗納粹車於一切的觀念，則迄今似尙無所改變，美日談判之仍呈藕斷絲連狀態就是一證。而據特夫古柏與樸芳的談話，前者則表示英美均不欲戰事蔓延至太平洋，後者則明謂遠東則戰爭是英人心目中的最後一步，希特勒纔是英人的大敵。由此可見英美雙方在遠東的種種措施，在本質上仍屬於消極的，換言之也就是要等好戰者有所行動纔不得已起而應付，至低限度還不立時準備以積極措置求遠東危局的澈底澄淸；而期望日本覺悟之意念縱極微弱，亦尙未斷念。以此之故，乃不能不避免一些可能觸忤日方的必要措施，有如英美對蘇聯在遠東的合作，始終無所從事，似乎英美雙方對此都屬有意規避。納粹自然是民治國家的大敵，而居心叵測的納粹羽翼尤其不容寬縱：最近希特勒方對蘇再度大舉進犯，日軍亦復重整其在華的攻勢，其是吾出於有計畫的預謀未可知，而希特勒日前演說中法日關係正在增進中一語究屬未容輕視。爲了計出萬全，英美實有在遠東攷慮更積極主動措施與步驟的必要</p>
<h3>英國軍人於湘北會戰後　對華軍印象極深刻　日邀滬外記者視察長沙事　已成爲倫敦新聞界之笑談</h3>
<p>倫敦（遲到）　英國軍界人十對於華軍在湘北會戰中所表現之力量獲有極深刻之印象、日方邀請滬外籍記者視察（日軍佔領下之長沙）一事、已成爲倫敦新聞界之笑談、日內閣發言人石井最初作誇大之言、其後有人詢以湘北戰事對美日談話、將發生何種影響時、則僅答稱（請詢問美政府可也）、其語調之前後不同、適相映成趣、日方之挫敗已使其（强大之軍力）大形削弱、此在英國及同盟國人士之眼中所謂日方（强大之軍力）殊不堪一蹴也、反之、中國已以事實而不徒託空言之成就提高華方將領與士兵之威望云、（二日電）</p>

<h3>國貨南銷機會已屆　促進對荷印貿易　英美對日經濟封鎖强化　華僑利用時機爭取市場　美棉輸日斷絕後印棉又禁止運往</h3>
<p>因事來滬不久之荷印華僑商界鉅子某君、昨語記者稱、「荷印華僑業已組織中荷貿易促進委員會，以便竭力推銷國貨、而荷印當局爲保護土產、已實施限制進口辦法、且因最近之凍結日資、日貨巳無法在荷印傾銷、此舉當於我國有利、希望國貨廠商、能把握此一良好機會、加倍努力、爭取南洋國貨市塲、</p>
<p>利用時機　競爭市場</p>
<p>該君續謂、「至於中荷貿易、吾人不容諱言、中國過去非農非工、農產品旣仰外來、工業品亦少輸出、反觀荷印、農產豐富、煤油錫礦、所在皆是、其仰給外國者、僅爲洋貨布疋、但此兩者、過去中國均不能與日本爭衡、故荷印與中國貿易、每年均出超、而今日貨旣已無法運銷荷印、則大好機會、國貨廠商必須善爲利用、尤以棉織方面、更爲重要、當竭力改良品質、幷增加產量、則荷印市塲、可唾手而得、中荷貿易促進委員會之成立、其目的原在此耳、</p>
<p>英美與日　經濟斷絕</p>
<p>據日文大陸新報記載國對日經濟封鎖、益形强化、頗給上海經濟界以衝動、在英國頒布對日資產凍結令之初、一般觀測、頗具相當伸縮性、印度棉花、年產的五百萬担、因不適用於全部印度及英國之紡織機、故對日輸出、依然如故、但現已禁止對日輸出、並由印度政府發表對日輸出必須許可制、故印棉輸入、可以樂觀說、就現狀論、與當初理想適相反、致使印棉運日、陷於困難狀態、今印度政府之意見、已與英本國强硬態度一致、業已判明、美棉輸入希望斷絕之現階段、印棉輸入又全部斷絕、是以今後大量棉布需要印棉者、將以何種方法活動、頗覺困難」、</p>
<p>華僑力量　極為充實</p>
<p>渠繼述目前荷印僑胞概况、謂「荷印在南洋之地位、比較馬來亞。越南·菲列濱及泰國、更覺重要、當地華僑人數雖少、但其經濟力量、則有過？而無不及、故當地政府、對我僑胞、亦頗重視、華僑經濟力量雖大、但其缺點亦多、機構之不健全、商業新智識之缺乏、難以應付現代之商業競爭、環觀全境、無一百數十萬元資本之大企業公司、而土人之智識、反與日俱增、設僑胞不圖改進、則過去優越之地位、將隳於一旦、因此中荷貿易促進委員會之設立、自屬必要、</p>
<p>熱望祖國　必勝必成</p>
<p>最後記者復詢及荷印僑胞對祖國之期望、據稱、當與其他各地僑胞有同一觀感、首先希望祖國必勝必成、使華僑地位、更爲提高、其决希望當局能善待歸僑、妥爲保護、因僑胞在外、刻苦耐勞、晚年歸國、當欲求、舒適生活、或返國投資、故於祖國治安、更望予以改善、使得保障、此外華僑因遠離祖國、對國內情形、未免隔閡、若欲僑資內移、應有完善之指導機關、例如香港爲僑胞出入之交通樞紐、倘能在港設立一專爲華僑服務之機關、貫通兩地消息、情影當能改觀云、</p>
<h3>格拉第　有來滬傳說</h3>

<p>上海一行</p>
<p>俾與此間美國官憲會晤、並從事調查經濟情形、加强制裁軸心效率、故格氏或將於三國財政會議後來滬一行、格氏於八月十二日奉命來遠東考察經濟、由舊金山乘機抵達馬尼刺、據關係方面消息、格氏此來任務、爲調查整個民主國家在遠東對軸心所施壓力、俾使ABCD四强</p>

<h3>英電組織　秘密查票</h3>
<p>據平明社記者昨日獲得消息、英商電車公司爲決心制止買票昌舞弊起見、特已訓令若干外籍高級職員、組織秘密稽查隊、的二三人一組、此項人員、受有特權、均可不顧電車是吾在開動、可隨時令其停止、而上車加以檢查、如經查出、即將按照公司規則處罰、又悉、最近電車公司各路電車之賣票人、自經賣票員王萬祥推斃項東川案發生後、致引起輿論公憤、一致指摘、現各賣票員舞弊之風、已見减少、</p>
<h3>鮑恩總巡明春返滬　辭職說非事實　史密斯代總巡昨特否認</h3>
<p>自日籍特別副總巡赤木被刺身死、總巡鮑恩在休假赴加拿大旅行中、日方即向工部局要求、改組警務處機構、擴大日籍副總巡職權、圖與總巡駢肩行事、日方報紙爲呼應起見、故速日鼓吹鮑恩已辭職、此後不致返滬銷假、工部局副總巡代理總巡史密斯、以此事並非事實、特於昨日發表談話、予以否認、以正視聽、據稱、「最近外傳鮑恩總巡辭職說、據余所知、絕非事實、鮑恩至遲於明年三月十七日前、必返滬銷假、以渠旣無辭職之理由、且與特別副總巡問題絕不相關、在過去歷任總巡、均有長期休假旅行之舉、若謂此舉即係辭職、實爲不可想像之事、關於特別副總巡問題、係以職權爲中心、刻正由當局與日本總領事館方面交涉中」、</p>
<h3>各銀行通力合作　辦理信托存款　導引游資內移已趨急切　存款利息優厚並予紅利</h3>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、自英美凍結中國資金、以及平準基金會消滅上海黑市之後、上海滙市完全改觀、法幣匯價業已公定五元三四三七五、各業因正當需要外匯者、均得向平準基金會申請、經核准之後方得結滙、故上海滙市實已進入管理階段、與昔日之自由買賣逈不相同、外滙買賣旣經限制、則有豐富游資欲作外滙投機亦屬不可能、因此上海游資之出路發生重大問題、</p>
<p>導引內移　較前急切</p>
<p>過去上海法幣滙價之維持、實為抑制上海物價鞏固法之信用、更因上海與內地之經濟運帶關係、間接防止內地物價之飛漲、凍結以後外滙投機雖已不可能、但巨額游資已多移轉目標而囤積貨物、作崇情形、不亞於前、內地物價亦隨之影響、惟有獎勵游資內移、方克抑制物價、是故現在游資內移問題、實與昔日之維持黑滙有同樣之重要性、反較以前更爲急切、今中中交農四行、對游資內移、已訂有優待保障辦法、以全力辦理、</p>
<p>各銀行已　通力合作</p>
<p>本年以來、上海　部分游資、鑒於國際局勢之變幻莫測、多已自動內移、迄六月止、共達八萬五千萬元、其中以四月份爲最多、計達三萬萬元、然而留滬游資爲數仍巨、總計的達三十萬萬元、如不能因勢利導、將來上海與內地之物價、將不堪設想、今各銀行深鑒於此、已與政府通力合作、努力吸收信託存款、由政府運用於內地產業、而對存戶除保障優厚利息外、更予以分紅、委託代放之款、由滬滙人內地、予以升水、期滿得在內地領取十足法幣云、</p>
<h3>難民給養　入不敷出　本月起加造散費</h3>
<p>上海市難民救濟協會、自本年度初、開始積極遣散所屬各收容所難胞以來、截止目前止、已由一萬九千餘人减至一萬三千餘人、據該會辦事員稱、目下本市生活程度高漲、實為該會遺散工作不能如期進行之最大原囚、因一般難胞、深恐一旦離所後、食宿無所、故大都小願離去、</p>

<h3>廢物生產（昨續）</h3>
<p>— 復圭</p>
<p>工藝救濟特訪</p>
<p>義務學校　難童樂園</p>
<p>該社並注意難工子弟之敎育間題，利用大南門淸心中學男女二部原來校舍，設立義務完全小學及幼稚園各一所，在學者小學四百五十人，幼雅園五十人，學生大部份爲難工子弟，街頭流浪兒童亦儘量使之入學。同時附設成人識字班。分晨夜二班，使難工之不識字者及附近貧苦文盲有讀書機會。以上所述學校，完全免費，並供給午膳，以後一切文具書籍，更有一特點値得提出的，就是該校師生所應用的全係捐來之廢物，斷筆破紙，皆加利用，而成績却並不因之遜色。記者嘗參觀敎師休息室，見玻梱內陳有學生作文美術等課卷，正面爲字爲畫，反面則赫然爲已用過之帳單，蓋係某西餐社大量捐投於普益袋中者。該校敎師亦多爲難工干弟出身，故服務母校，益見奮勉，視爲他們最樂願担任之工作。</p>
<p>兒童食堂　行將斷糧</p>
<p>設於校內的免費食堂，每日供給數百兒童之午膳，以前全賴美國紅十字會所捐之米麥，同時以所餘救濟附近老弱難胞，菜餚則由該社附設之難工農塲供給。自上海美國間輪運减少後，此項美紅會米麥，就宣吿自下月起不再繼續運來，這眞是一個致命的打擊。據云凍結資金實行後，美國敎會方面的經濟接濟，亦日趨困難。在二重危機下，貧苦兒童，行將斷糧，而不能在安心讀書後，獲得一餐免費午膳了。這是何等嚴重的事實，而需要社會人仕在物質上予以幫助與挽救的！</p>
<p>（附誌）普益工藝社在公共租界渶口路一百十五號二樓設有辦事處。</p>

<h3>上海生死攸關（鼎談錄）</h3>
<p>鼎談日期　中華民國三十年十月二日下午一時起</p>
<p>鼎談地點　內外政治經濟編譯社內</p>
<p>日美戰事，在所難免。砲聲前的談判，不過肆殺前挨延時日上應有的準備吧？日美開戰，上海完了嗎？不戰，上海也能長此維持下去嗎？許多人認爲決定上海前途的關鍵在於當地的政治；殊不知交通問題，關係更大。這是筆者三人此次鼎談時一致的意見；本文便是這决鼎談的結論。是耶吾耶？質諸高明。吾人認爲此非智者見智，仁者見仁，可以敷衍過去；實係上海與上海人生死攸關的問題。瞻望前途，似已爲日無多；試問如何而後可？</p>
<h3>政治重於交通歟　交通重於政治歟</h3>
<p>上海前途的關鍵在那裏？如果撖開政治問題，那該是貨遝交通問題了罷。其實就是從政治的觀點來說：對外交通的能否維持？關係也十分重大。因爲英美船隻繼續來滬，那末英美和上海的關係也就可以加緊。當然：英美船隻萬一停止來滬，並非就是英美放棄上海或從上海撒退的表示。但在這種局勢下面，就是上海對外交通成爲問題的那時，上海的政治局面也許也就不能和現在一樣了吧？這就是說：上海的對外交通間題，也可決定上海的政治局面。然上海的政治局面，却不會決定上海對外交通問題的。決定上海對外交通問題的關鍵，不在上海的政局，而在世界的政局。如果國際政局不變，那末無論上海的政局感受任何壓力，英美決不會停止其船隻的來滬，也許還會適得其反。因爲由於上海是英美在遠東的最後堡壘，決不因當地發生任何情勢就變更其固定的政策。因此吾人可以說：上海前途的關鍵，倒在於上海對外的貨運交通問題，上海當地的政治情勢，實在不像一般人想像的那麽重大。似乎不是武斷吧？</p>
<p>上海交通斷絕時如何</p>
<p>爲什麼貨運交通問題會對上海前途具有如此重大的決定性呢？理由很簡單：特別是在經濟方面。試申述之：</p>
<p>（一）上海雖已變成孤島，但依然做着全國領域中部分的集散中心。淪陷區裏的物產，靠這裏呑吐；就是後方的物資供需，部分的也靠這裏呑吐。甚至速日木國內的，靠着上海港口的轉出入，爲數更不少。然而完成這種集散任務的條件，便是貨運交通。一旦對外交通停滯，上海在經濟上的地位就要完全變觀，是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>（二）上海雖是遠東最大的商業港，但也不失爲一大工業都市。中國的出口土產，在上海加工製造。進口原料，在上海精造。全國最大的民族紡織工業和麵粉工業乃至一切輕工業和簡眾的機械工具製造業，都集中在上海。然而不論是土產原料或舶來品原料，如果一旦停止運滬，上海的整個工業機構，便全盤崩潰。而這些原料的對滬供給，便以貨運交通爲其先決條件。</p>
<p>（三）近年上海的繁榮，不是靠着戰爭景氣而是靠着戰事的惡果，戰爭景氣的構成，基山戰爭對於物資的需要；而上海的繫榮，完全靠着人口和游資的集中。因人口集中，生活品的需耍及其關係商業便繫興。因爲游資集中，投機事業便發在的興起。萬一海外交通停頓，生活品接濟中止，集中的人口勢必分散；游資也跟着分散，投資事業必也跟着衰落。而投機事業的衰落，也能加速人口的分散。目前上海的市面，可以說完全靠着投機事業支持的。</p>
<p>竟然有三種非非之想</p>
<p>現在有一批想入非非的所謂人們，他們以爲上海萬一因太平洋戰事揭開而跌進十足的淪陷局面時，上海的現有經濟機構仍不致停頓。一因有日輪代英美商輪進出，二因日本對上海生產設備有絕對需要。還有另一批的妄想，以爲日本爲了需要繼續取得海外的物資供給，可能放任上海處於中立性的地位。那時上海的局面，當然要變成另一種樣子，但並非就是大上海的毀滅局面。姑不談這種觀念上的奴性，只把牠和交通之與上海前途的決定性聯繫起來，那就是說：決定上海前途的不是交通問題，而是政治問題。</p>
<h3>死港荒島廢埠　大上海的毀滅</h3>
<p>雖有船亦將無貨可運</p>
<p>我們不否認政治問區對於上海的決定性，比交通問題來得大。但無論如何，上海當地的政治問題，決不會變更上海對外的交通情勢：除非整個國際局勢發生變化時，才會影響到上海的對外交通。上海對外交通條件發生變化，那時上海的局勢，可能變成那些幻想家們所幻想的那副樣子。但不幸的，對外交通旣有了問題，那些幻想着的局面也就救不了大上海的毀滅。砲毀大上海，也許不會在未來的太平洋戰爭中出現，但因交通停滯使大上海窒息而死是頂可能的。事情非常明顯：英美旣和日本發生戰爭，那末英美及其領屬地的物資，自然不會再供給日本勢力支配中的地區，上海也就不會例外。那時的日本商船隊，即使尙有餘力可供運貨，恐也有無貨可運之虞吧？何况牠有吾這種餘力？尙屬一大疑問。</p>
<p>工廠烟囪則無烟可吐</p>
<p>英美及其領屬地包刮南洋各島在內，由於太平洋大戰之故，對日本勢力圈內的物資交易完全停頓的結果，上海的生產設備日本即使計劃利用，也將陷入無米爲炊的局面。天不怕地不怕的機器，獨怕沒有原料。如果僅僅靠着淪陷區裹的原料來維持，試間淪陷區能有什麽原料司供十海現有的工業設備之用吧？米，麥，棉花，大豆，生絲，和極微少的煤和鐵砂，果然可以得之於中國的淪陷區。然而這些不是日本所想科用上海工業設備的目標。何况太平洋戰事一開，各地華軍勢必奮起反攻，淪陷區物資對上海的洪給力，更將大大衰退。因之上海屋頂上聳起的那些工廠烟囱，日本即使不予破壞而預備加以利用，也不會吐着烏燜，像現在一樣；是不　想像得之。</p>
<p>日人如此這般的算盤</p>
<p>替日本設想，到了太平洋大戰發生，而踏進不可避免的原料饑荒之時，對於上海現有的集散地性質，理應加以珍惜和愛護。到那時，放任上海的國際中立地位之繼續，使上海變成日本取得民主陣綫國家物資供給的中繼站，確於日本有絕對的利益。作此幻想的日本人，也許也比其他種人更多吧？但不幸的這只是日本方面的如意算盤，試問民主陣綫保留上海這個門戶，還有什麼好處？換句話說：爲什麼民主陣綫還要保留上海這個港口？爲什麼還要對上海供給物資以齊敵呢</p>
<p>依日本的幻想家，像上海每日新聞的記者在美英宣佈凍結中日資金那時所發表的幻想：他們以爲今日歐洲大戰雖使軸心國和民主國的經濟關係完全割斷了，但雙方必需交換的物資，仍能在瑞士這中立國的市塲上進行交易。保留瑞士的中立，在軸心和民主國雙方都屬有利。而保留上海的中立，他們以爲情形亦復相同。因之在遠東大戰之中，上海可能變成瑞士一樣。</p>
<p>日本人的這種幻想，會給擔愁上海前途同時又迷戀上海的那般人們大爲興奮。然而幻想終究是幻想，上海和瑞士却有其絕對不同的命運，決不因上海具有複雜的國際關係，便可和瑞士在複雜的巴爾幹半島上維持其中立地位，合乎同等的資格了。</p>
<h3>政治經濟與地位　上海非瑞士可比</h3>
<p>第一上海並無獨立的資格，那是中國領土的一部，由種種外交條約而變成今日這副國際都市的狀態，與但澤自由市等本質上絕對不同。與瑞士之具有獨立資格更屬絕對不同。因爲瑞士具有獨立國的資格，所以他的中立，便產生於他的第三者的地位，他在軸心和民主雙方的鬥爭中，只要不作左右袒，雙方就無法侵犯其中立，同時且應尊重共中立，從而也得利用其中立。上海那就不同，淪陷部份是在日本勢力控制之下；租界上的所謂複雜關係，其實仍不脫民主　綫和軸心陣錢的兩重關係之交錯罷了。因之僅僅在中日戰爭的今日，要使租界恪守中立，已戞戞乎爲難之至，到租界的大老板英美和日本業敵對了的場合，在上海也就絕對無中立的可能。當然，夢想家慣會發夢囈，甚至猜測未來大戰中英美將把上海租界交給第三者代管，並推測這第三者將是誰？並斷言這第三者，必受日本的優待而讓他　逍遙於集中營之外的人。然而到那時，所謂第三者，若非　本卵蠶下的產物，就不會有第三者。因之在遠東大戰的塲合，上海決無一個眞正的第三者出現之可能。</p>
<p>第二英德雙方保留瑞七的中立市場，並加以充分的利用，不僅由於瑞士確具第三者的資格和主權，同時又確實有利用此中立市塲的價値。因爲德國的重工業之過剩出品，民主陣綫未始不可予以歡迎；而民主國的工業產品和工業原料，在德國的軍需工業上也屬求之不得之物。雙方都有利用這中立市塲的價値，這中立市塲便得隨之而發展與繁榮，並可屹立不動了。然在未來的遠東大戰塲合，試問英美等國所求於日本的是什麽？而日本所能出口供給英美的又有什麽？人造絲，綢緞布疋，玩具，罐頸魚類，是日本上號出品，又是都非英美軍需經濟中所歡迎的。英美何求之有？英美及其領屬地對日的供給品：石油，鋼材，機械，五金原村料等，日本果然歡迎之不暇，然英美豈願繼續供給呢？總而言之，英德保留並利用瑞士中立市塲，有其保留的必要，有其利用的價値。至於上海，如果要使他變成中立市塲，在日本固有保的必要和利用的價値，在英美却絕無此種必要，絕無利用價値。最多爲了减少其在滬僑民之財產損失，不作隨地抗戰，那是給予未來上海最大一種的優待了。</p>
<p>第三就地理形勢上說：瑞士雖高懸巴爾幹半島的阿爾俾斯山峯之上，南北爲德意的軸心圈環裹，但東部和法蘭西接境。於是軸心國的過剩產品之流入瑞士的中立市塲，果極容易，就是英美等民主國的過剩產品，也可假道自由區法蘭西的市塲而達瑞士的市塲。然而上海的地位如何？可說藏在日本海軍防綫的腹地之區，試問日本有無膽量開放其海軍防綫，使所謂中立國的船隻得一通路，航到上海？到那時即使偶一有之，但決不能挽回上海這死港的厄運，是可想而知的。</p>
<p>總而言之：維持上海，只有日本有利，對於英美乃至中國的戰爭經濟，可說無利可言。因之到了國際政局大變時，日本即使不以政治壓力加諸上海，上海也耍變成死港。那就是說：到那時上海的政治局面即使不變，也不能希望海外交通的繼續。而國際政局維持現狀不就惡化時，上海前途的命運，更取決於交通條件的圓滑與吾。依現狀來說：上海的海外交通，正在一天不如一天的糟下去，不僅是船隻的减少，而且是水脚的激漲，這一面是加重上海物價市塲上的壓力，同時也在加重上海市面內在的破局。而船隻减少和水脚高漲的趨勢，尙在方興未艾，有遠見的上海產業資金曷不先事防範？</p>
<h3>交通環境越糟　囤貨危險越大</h3>
<p>儼然是英雄所見相同</p>
<p>近幾年來，上海人雖已飽歷許多虛驚，膽子却也大了不少。一派樂觀論：包刮日美不會開戰，開戰後的上海也不會無事可爲……，起初原不過是無可奈何中聊以自慰的說法，現在似早已變成他們的一種信念。船隻一天天减少下去，他們知道的；貨物的供給一天天减少下去，他們也知道的。然而他們另有一把算盤：進口少，出口也少；有錢決無問題。所以爬錢是第一要緊。有錢還靠不住，最好是實在的貨物。有了貨物，包可百無禁忌。人家越慌，他們那就越得法。究因他們對於日美開戰，將信將疑。死囤不如活囤，旣可以不把資金擱煞，又可以從多一决進出中，多賺一筆錢。一個兒進出，資力畢竟有限：何不利用市塲上的游資來擴大他自已的計劃？於是他們便構成了一個邏輯：囤貨不如投機，投機不如開銀行，擴大進行。開銀行，旣可以吸收存款，又可以經營各秤投機；一旦風吹車動，更可以大規模囤積居奇。而且銀行業不比其他，交通斷也好，通也好，都沒有關係。最近新銀行蓬勃產生，眞可謂英雄所見相同。</p>
<p>辦銀行也是危機重重</p>
<p>但不幸的，這種新銀行的產生，只會增加他們資金上的危險，同時又把上海的市面推向更大的危險路上去。理由非常簡單。只就他們的資金危險上說吧。</p>
<p>（一）銀行業根本是一種信用事業，在人心浮動的戰時，隨時會碰到倒霉的事。八一三戰事發生中上海銀錢業所以能應付過去，完全靠着安定金融辦法。近年來銀錢業所以能續享繁榮，則全靠戰事不在上海，與投機事業獲得順利的發展。而對外交通的繼續維持，尤爲使上海得以構成現局的最大原因。在多變的今後，情形恐將完全相反。</p>
<p>（二）銀行家與一般存戶，都有囤錢不如囤貨的心理，因之交通條件露骨變化的塲合，勢必發生存戶提存以囤貨，而銀錢業則出囤以資應付提存。市塲的混亂局面且不必說，銀行本身先大倒其霉，是應母庸疑的了。</p>
<p>交通與囤貨者的利害</p>
<p>（三）當前國際局勢的推演，只有使上海對外交通益益惡化的可能，沒有使上海對外交通得以轉危爲安的希望。可以想像的德蘇戰事跟天氣的凍結而凍結之後，德英間的海戰將繼之而激化。而美國對中英蘇實物援助的急進，船舶需要勢必也耍强化。於是上海的對外交通情勢也就越糟了。</p>
<p>上海對外交通情形越惡化，上海對於日本的利用價值也就减退。這種因果，等於法幣和日本的關係完全相同。法幣的匯兌統制效力越大，那就是日本套購外匯的可能越小。日本套購法幣外匯的可能越小，法幣對於日本的利用價値也就越小。於是日本對於法幣的破壞企圖，可能再燃。現在法幣的匯兌統制力雖已增强，但日本多少尙可套購一些。這聊勝於無的狀態，才穩定了他現下的苦悶情緒。</p>
<p>日本希望上海市塲的有在，目的在於利用上海這港口以取得他在本國所不易獲得的英美貨物。上海的對外交通條件越糟，上海對於他的利用價値自然也越小。於是在他極度感受物資恐慌的時期，豈肯放過租界區裹的大批囤貨？日本對他國民的貨物尙且在普通徵發，難道反肯放鬆上海人不成？</p>
<p>「日本沒收上海倉庫裏囤貨」一詞，決非嚇小孩子的話，現在所以不就進行，政治問題是一點，上海之尙有利用價值也是一點；上海對日本所以尚有利用價值，號入上海的對外交通尙未完全阻斷；雖則船舶一天天减少，畢竟是聊勝於無。之後，國際局勢越緊，則使日本的備戰益亟，一面使日本的物資恐慌益重，另一面又使日本對於上海港的利用價値越小。在此無可奈何之祭，自然只有殺鶏求卵之一途。母鶏沒有病而殺之求卵，果是笨伯所爲。母鶏旣有病了，情形就不同。所以上海對外交通越糟，物價果也跟着越糟，囤貨者的利益似乎也像越大；可是他們的危險却也越厲害。</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>受過教育的主婦能彀做些什麼工作？</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>許多人會經發出了　樣的疑問：「家庭婦女，能彀做些什魔工作？」　在確是個問題，許碰有聞階級，在這樣一個疑問之下，於是終日打牌閒逛，麻木了伊們的理智。</p>
<p>其實，一個受過相當敎育的主婦，在家事的餘暇中正有許多事情可以做，尤其是關於文化方面的，因爲男子們爲着維持家庭的進款，也許沒有充裕的時間可以實行。</p>
<p>如果你有一點餘暇，那末你可以從事研究，從事寫作，從事收集，從事編纂，有許多有價値的書籍，亦可以從此產生。因爲偉大的工作需要不斷的努力，即使每天只有一小時的餘閒，有一年二年的時間，也可以大有成就了。</p>
<p>其次愛好音樂的爲什麼不試試作曲，愛星內裝飾的，爲什麼不多讀些書，愛好圖畫的，爲什麽不創立一種新的作風，這些事，都是適合婦女的個性的能彀選擇一種，不斷地努力，人生不將更有意義嗎？</p>
<h3>托爾斯泰太太的怨言</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>凡是對於文學有相當愛好的人，終知道托爾斯泰這個偉大人物，他生於一八二八年，歿於一九一〇年，生平的著作很多，尤以一戰事與和平」一書，使他躍登文壇，佔着崇高的地位。</p>
<p>然而他不能享受他的家庭生活，他的太太，曾經發生了下列的怨言：「他實在是沒有眞正的熱忱的，因爲熱忱只是他的主義，而並不是由心中發出來的，在他的傳記中固然可以看到他幫助勞工挑水，然而在家裏他始終不使我有一些休息的時間（在三十二年的結婚生活中，始終如此），他也不曾給他的孩子喝一點水，也從不會在我的床邊坐上五分鐘，使我得到一點安愉。」</p>
<p>雖則對於實際情形，我們不得而知，但從表面看來，托爾斯泰的夫婦情感，一定不會十分和睦。而他的太太所發的怨言，是有一些偏見的，一個畢生盡瘁於文學的丈夫，對於家庭方面的偶有疏忽，並不是一種罪過。一個從事寫作的人，他必須全神貫注在他的工作上面，絲毫不容疏忽，方始有偉大的成就；如果他以家庭生活爲重，那末他決不能有偉大的著作產生出來。爲妻子自身的安樂着想，在現代頗有「不要下嫁一個作家」的論調，然而爲社會和國家着想，而把自身放在最後，那末有一個像托爾斯泰一樣的丈夫是多麽榮幸的事。（這裏所說的榮幸，我的意思是國家的榮幸，社會的榮幸，文化的榮幸。最後方纔是自身的榮幸）所以一個妻子如果能够明瞭丈夫的偉大而使他對於社會有相當的貢獻，精神上所得到的安愉將十倍於形體上不得到的快樂。</p>
<p>附帶地記述一下，托爾斯泰在一九一〇年突然離開了他的家庭，躱在一個亞斯塔布哇的小屋中，不久就爲着心臟病而逝世了。</p>
<p>&gt;我的家庭問題</p>
<p>[P「我的家庭問題」徵文揭曉　後母手中的子女</p>
<p>— 余中</p>
<p>這次徵文，收到很多，足見讀者對於本刊愛護的熱忱，現從本期起，當按期發表。</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>一提到家，總令人想到「溫暖」「美滿這兩個形容詞來。然而我的家，郤是冷如冰霜，而沒有絲毫値得留戀的。</p>
<p>爸娶了後母，又因了職務關係，每月只回家兩决，因此我便成了伊手中的雛雀，一任伊的擺佈和磨折。</p>
<p>每天早晨五時半我就起身，生煤爐，侍候弟弟妹妹們（後母生的）上學，倒馬桶，收拾房間，然後自己上學。到了中午，回來之後，還要燒飯，洗衣服。幸而校中每天要到下午三時才上課，所以還勉强可以應付。晚學後，回來燒晚飯，代弟弟妹妹們做鞋子，補襪子，整天爲了這些家事忙個不了。媽起身極遲，每天坐在外邊看牌，所以任何的雜事都落到了我的肩上。</p>
<p>十時之後，該是我預備功課的時候了，然而妹妹說開了電燈睡不着，媽因此照例發一頓牢騷：『女孩子念什麽書？識得幾個字就算了。一天到晚捧着書，眞要中女狀元了。本來末，我怎麽管得了人家，別人獨斷獨行，我那兒有做娘的份。」伊又轉身向妹妹說「死鬼！睡不着也要睡！說話眼也不開，人家錢多呀，這麼貴的電燈儘開。』天呀！這樣的環境中我怎麽念得下書．可是媽早就說過：『花了錢就該考得好，成績非在三名之內，下學期不准再繼續下去！」</p>
<p>爸回來了，媽當潘衆人的面叉是一番訴說：「什麼事都不會做，一天到晚讀書寫字，紙有我老娘姨受苦。唉！做晚娘眞難呀！再待伊好些，伊也不知道。』如果這時我做着家事，伊就得添上這麽一句：「做什麽面子呀，念你的書去！』伊會立刻搶去我手中的活計，將我推在一旁。此外，伊阻止我和爸單獨見面，其實就是和爸兩人在一起，我也沒有什麼好說的，爸老了，我不願傷他的心。侍伊知道了這層之後，伊待我更險惡了。</p>
<p>我的家就是這樣的家，寫到這兒，媽輸了錢回來，又指桑駡槐地咕嚕起來……</p>
<p>像余中女士的情形，我敢說在中國家庭中是很多的。我們不反對男子們續娶，然而續娶的男子，決不能爲了自身的幸福而忘記了子女的前途。所以凡是在後母手中嚐到苦痛的子女，他們的父親實在應該負相當的責任，因爲後母的子女，決不是在結婚時就帶來的，至少在初婚的時候，做父親的就可以做一些工作，避免後母的歧視前妻所生的子女，而同時也可以從中使前妻所生的子女對於後母不要另生一種觀念，認爲後母終是要虐待前妻的子女的。</p>
<p>自然，這種悲劇中的主動者旣然是後母，在受過一些敎育的後母終不應該有什麼歧視，或虐待的舉動。在這樣一個大時代裏，子女不再是父母的私產了，他們是國家的，那末爲什麼要爲了自己生養的一些關係而破壞家庭中和平的空氣呢。</p>
<p>無論如何，這是一個値得討論的問題，希望讀者有更具體的意見貢獻，略誌數語，無非拋磚引玉而已。　編者</p>

<h3>一班辦公制</h3>
<p>— 畏三</p>
<p>這幾天，上海外商硏究所謂一班辦公制，並且已有美商十二家通告實行。目的是在於節省煤斤的消耗，因爲現在天時漸短，轉瞬叉交冬令，一到下午，電燈和熱水汀所需要的煤量，着實可驚，在這煤貴如金的時代，此一舉措，在表面上看來，似乎確屬必要。</p>
<p>照美商的辦法，是把上下午兩班的工作，併成一班，從上午八時開始工作，至下午一時辦公終了，中間並不休息，至於下午一時以後，那就任各職員自由回家去了。我們對於道個新的建議，從事實上和利弊上着想，覺得有硏討的必要，當然，我們並不是批評外商改革辦公時間的得失，不過僅憑客觀的立塲，就事論事而已。</p>
<p>我們認爲凡是一種制度，除非萬不得已外，在新的辦法未有良好結果保證以前，不能把舊的制度輕易廢掉，因爲有時推行新制，未見其利，反而弊端叢生，如再重返舊制，則又何必多此一舉。現在上海整個社會，都是實行兩班辦公制，巳爲傳統習慣，一且改爲一班，大家必覺不便。經營商業，與各方接觸，最爲頻繁，如果甲公司實行一班辦公，乙公司於下午有重大交易須與甲公司接洽，則將待之明日，其間的損失，是小言而喩的。除本埠外，外埠及國際間電報訊件的往返，躭擱半日，關係也不能算小。我們除爲便利自己着想，同時應當爲別人打算，所謂利己利人者是，如果只圖利己，在原則上是不能成立的。</p>
<p>至於節省煤斤，究竟至如何程度，在未有精確統計以前，現在還不能論斷。總之，我們認爲開源是一件事，節流又是一件事，如果營業進展，事務忙碌，則辦公室中，電火通明，雖至薄暮，還應有人工作，當然不斤計較於煤費之負擔了。若說職　擔任一班工作，可省一趟車資，則回家以後，自下午一時至午夜九時，在這很長的時問中，說不定要去看電影，跳舞，共所化費的，當數十倍於一趟車資。</p>
<p>中國人眞是値得自傲的，我們夙興夜寐，刻苦耐勞的精神，從老祖宗一直傳到現在；雖然都市之中，需要電燈，消耗煤斤，但是鄕村之中，或者根本就用不着煤，上海的普通商店中，也從來不曾有過熱水汀。我想，在今年的冬天，我們大家多穿些衣服，無庸生火爐，至於不必要的電燈，可儘量减少光支，從堅苦卓絕中，節省煤斤消耗，我們不必仿行一班辦公制，我們應當加緊工作，努力生產，維護從早至晚的長班辦公制。</p>
<h3>冷禪老人續絃幽默話</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>冷禪老人，將於中秋節後某日續娶，木道人曾贈以一聯，有踰東家牆而摟其處子之句，其友吹萬居士，以摟字爲傳神之筆，即以摟宇爲首句，戲塡十六字令六國以賀之，謔而不傷稚，並寓箴規之意，頗堪一噱。</p>
<p>十六字令六闋有序</p>
<p>半個道人，修到神仙之半，禪巢居士，參來歡喜之禪，（半個木道人禪巢居士均木道人爲冷禪所取號）占生稊之枯楊，定多吉夢，撫着花之老樹，安有醜枝。敢進箴規，聊寓諧謔，詞歌小令，抵十六字之眞傳，月朗中秋，頌一百年之好合。</p>
<p>摟，老去風情未减吾？房須謹，愛氣莫輕遊。</p>
<p>摟，溫了重溫柔更柔，魂消未？眞個且休休。</p>
<p>摟，刺頰吟髭異樣修，誰能數，不許一莖留。</p>
<p>摟，今夜懷中試一投，同床夢，寗可隔鴻溝。</p>
<p>摟，室有雙魚好注眸，相追逐，紅艷映瓷甌。</p>
<p>摟，防有師窺在上頭，休在放，老樹不禁秋。</p>
<p>「註」老人所居之室有金魚兩尾，爰名曰雙魚精舍，老人一舉一動，木師無不知者，故第六闋云云。</p>

<h3>節邊送禮忙</h3>
<p>— 方揚</p>
<p>『阿二，到邵萬生去背隻蔣腿轉來，大的四十多點再到冠生園拿兩盒月餅，到先施或是永安去帶四瓶張裕葡萄酒，再乘手買籃水菓』，裝好個現成花籃，念幾只洋一只！二房東李先生在神氣地關照着車夫。</p>
<p>『記得牢哦？此地一百五十塊，儂點點看！』東家像很信任地委托了他。</p>
<p>其實，阿二是忠實的，在李家做了將近十四年了，而我搬來住以後，也老聽見房東說他的好處，所以，阿二很安心地爲主人像牛一樣地服役着。雖然，偶或有點怨言，但他總以爲，主人總是主人，我們做傭人的，就只好如此了。</p>
<p>今天，他很高興，因爲一則是主人相信他，二則，最實惠的，倒是又有「脚錢」好「進賬」了！</p>
<p>我看他興忽忽的出去了。他替主人節儉得很，不趁電車的。他常吿訴我！</p>
<p>『方先生，你想，我們車夫的腿，去着是跑路的，現在不拉車了，空了身子，難道，還要趁電車嗎？』</p>
<p>大概兩個鐘頭吧，阿二搬了四樣東西，走了回來，兩隻手給繩子切得都是一條血紅的印子。</p>
<p>東西給主人過了目，繳淸了賬，四張發票一共是一百零一元四角。</p>
<p>『你買得不壞！』李先生稱贊了他一聲。</p>
<p>『現在馬上替我送到馬浪路××號×公館去，那是位銀行經理的住宅，你進去當心點！』李先生去一邊抽着雪茄，一邊吩咐着。</p>
<p>阿二連幾聲『是，是，是』！就頭也不回的小心地拿着走了。</p>
<p>停停阿二回來了很開心，說是拿到了十二塊錢「力鈿」，分給娘姨兩塊，自己拿了十塊！</p>
<p>這幾天來，我耳朶裹就只聽見二房東在忙着送禮出去，人家送禮進來，這一筆錢的化費，想必不在五百元以內吧。可是，我不懂爲什麼許多社會事業需這樣費錢。而這樣的習俗，不知到幾時才能絕跡，可是，在這樣『千錯萬錯「馬屁」勿錯』的社會上，又怎麼辦呢？我不能回答。</p>
<p>晚上，二房東嫂嫂又在咕嚕了，「雷燈用得加傷，大家省省』！接着一記，關了門上樓去了。豁刺刺，倒出來的是牌聲，大約又要在一百支光底下又天亮了吧！</p>
<h3>腳氣病</h3>
<p>— 臧煥椿</p>
<p>病人：「先生！我覺得脚裹很不舒服，走路很不大方便？」</p>
<p>醫生：「這是上海最流行的所謂脚氣病！因爲吃了洋秈米飯，生理上缺少維他命所致。」</p>
<p>病人：「不！先生，我們家裏每天吃的常錫杜米呀；而且常服維他命ABCD」</p>
<p>醫生：「那末一定你是少作四肢運動！」</p>
<p>病人：「唉！先生，我每天差不多都在跳舞廳裏作運動呢？」</p>
<p>醫生：「那末……」</p>
<h3>胡言一束</h3>
<p>— 呂景朗</p>
<p>先生稱讚金</p>
<p>嘉明；「媽媽，今天學校裏的黃先生稱讚我了！」</p>
<p>媽媽：「黃先生怎麽說呢？」</p>
<p>嘉明：「黃先生說嘉明倘使能够把一切壞脾氣改掉，便是一個好孩子了！」</p>
<h3>一笑錄</h3>
<p>— 鄧仕頤</p>

They launched a major offensive towards Changsha starting on September 6th. After 22 days and nights of fierce ambush, flanking attacks, rear attacks, and encirclement by the Chinese army in the Dayun Mountain, Xinqiang River, Miluo River, Laodao River, Liuyang River, and Dongting Lake areas, the Japanese were finally lured to the decisive battle area between the Huaiyang River and Laodao River on the 27th of last month. The Chinese army launched a heroic and decisive encirclement from Pingjiang, Miluo, Xiangyin, Changsha, and Liuyang. The Japanese army fought bloody battles for four days and nights, during which they destroyed and captured over 250 armored vehicles transporting grain and ammunition southward. As a result, the fleeing Japanese troops not only suffered staggering casualties but also ran out of ammunition and supplies. They began to break through and retreat northward at 2 PM on October 2nd, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing and intercepting them. The Japanese army launched a major offensive with a massive force of 100,000 troops, determined to seize Changsha. Fortunately, Generalissimo Chiang's virtue was far-reaching, the plan was thorough, all the commanders provided guidance and assistance, and all the generals and soldiers fought valiantly, finally ensuring that Dongting Lake remained calm and Changsha remained safe, completing the great victory of the second decisive battle of Changsha. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) Luoyang, 9 PM on the 4th: The Japanese troops who sneaked into the Jibocheng (northeast of Zhengzhou) area and the Tenlipu, Gengzhuang (southeast of Zhengzhou) southeastern areas continued to receive substantial reinforcements on the night of the 3rd, and launched a fierce attack on Zhengzhou at dawn on the 4th under the cover of aircraft, tanks, and the release of poison gas. The Chinese army fought fiercely, giving ground step by step in order to exhaust the enemy, engaging in bloody hand-to-hand combat. Chinese and Japanese casualties were heavy, and by noon, Chinese and Japanese troops were in a chaotic battle near Zhengzhou. (2) Changsha, 4th: Chinese troops on all fronts continued to pursue and intercept the Japanese who broke through and fled northward, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese who crossed the north bank of the Miluo River are also being strongly intercepted by the Chinese in various locations. (3) Qingyuan, called on the 4th: The Chinese troops who crossed Mujiaowei (south of Qingyuan) to pursue the defeated Japanese troops captured Da Jie Xu on the morning of the 3rd. By 2 PM, they had defeated the Japanese at Lubao Xu, killing many Japanese on the spot. The Japanese collapsed and fled southwest towards Sanshui. After the Chinese fully recaptured Lubao Xu, they continued to pursue southward, and by the 4th, they had restored the original situation. (4) Tunxi, 4th: At around 4 AM one day, a Japanese medium-sized transport ship sailing upstream near the Qianjiangkou (near Anqing) on the front river surface was sunk by Chinese mobile artillery. All the military supplies on board sank to the bottom of the river. (5) Somewhere in Shandong, 4th: During the Tengxian Xulou battle last month, a captured Japanese sergeant, Fukuda Wasuke, confessed that he was 21 years old this year, from Nishisyodo County, Tokyo, a graduate of elementary school, and currently a sergeant in the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 212th regiment of the 12th division. During the Xulou battle, the regimental commander, Huiteng Chuan, has already gone missing. Japanese domestic males who are 15 years old are conscripted into the army. Material shortages are severe, and life is becoming more difficult every day. Under the high pressure of the warlords, the people dare not speak out. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese authorities have not acknowledged the Japanese claim that Zhengzhou fell yesterday. According to telegrams received here last night from the northern front, a fierce hand-to-hand battle took place outside Zhengzhou yesterday afternoon. After Japanese reinforcements arrived, they are now attacking the Chinese defenders from the northeast and southeast. The telegram stated that the Japanese launched the offensive at dawn yesterday, assisted by tanks and aircraft. It is reported that the Chinese army is resisting the Japanese advance very strongly. At the same time, the attention of the Chinese people remains focused on the situation in northern Hunan. (5th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese here all believe that the military actions currently being taken by the Japanese around Zhengzhou are largely for political purposes, namely to cover up the failure in the Hunan campaign. It is said that Zhengzhou is located at the intersection of the Longhai and Pinghan railways. Since the Japanese occupied the eastern section of the Longhai and the north-south sections of the Pinghan, it has long lost its military importance. For three years, the Japanese army has been separated from Zhengzhou only by the Yellow River, and it is located on the plains, making it difficult to defend once the Japanese troops cross the river. (5th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Xingji: In the southeastern Shanxi areas of Changzhi, Gaoping, Yangcheng, Fushan, Yicheng, Linfen, Liangmazhen, and other places, the Japanese gathered about 20,000 people and launched an offensive towards the Taiyue Mountains on the 27th of last month in five routes, passing through the Mabi, Wangbi, Kongtan, Zhengzhuang, Yunshou, Wangcun, and Xianwengmiao (southeast of Anze and northeast of the Fenshui) areas.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States, and the Far East</h3>
<p>The concern of the Western democratic powers for the Far East has recently reached an unprecedented level in history. The British War Cabinet sent Duff Cooper as a special representative to the Far East on August 26 to investigate the necessity of setting up a wartime cabinet mechanism in Singapore. For more than a month, he has been constantly traveling between Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, and India, making various important contacts and inspections. He also convened a meeting in Singapore earlier this month, attended by British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham, Straits Settlements Governor Thomas, China Fleet Commander Layton, Ambassador to China Kerr, Ambassador to Thailand Crossby, and Australian Minister of Commerce Page. The significant nature of this meeting can be easily understood from the attending figures. In addition, in terms of finance and economy, Bank of England Governor Niemeyer and U.S. Treasury Secretary's technical assistant Cochraine both flew from the U.S. to the Far East in early September to assist China in solving financial problems; at the same time, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, who came to the Far East to investigate economic conditions, arrived in the Chinese capital two days ago, receiving a warm welcome from the Chinese government and people, and will go to Hong Kong today to join Niemeyer and Cochraine in attending the trilateral financial meeting convened in Hong Kong. What is particularly noteworthy is that the British and American military leaders in the Far East, such as British and American Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham and MacArthur, U.S. Far East Fleet Commander Hart, and the U.S. military delegation to China, Magruder, gathered in Manila the day before yesterday to conduct important discussions. Although it concerns military secrets and the outside world has no way of knowing the details, judging from Brooke-Popham's statement that the scope of this meeting is wider than ever before, it can be asserted that it must be closely related to the developing current situation in the Far East, and is a concrete discussion of military cooperation in the Far East by the ABCD line-up. How to ensure that British and American aid materials can be delivered to China accurately and quickly is also clearly stated as one of the important topics of this meeting. Recently, China has demonstrated with the great victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan that it will never fail the expectations of all righteous people in the world, and can indeed shoulder the important task of the anti-aggression war in the Far East single-handedly without shame. Therefore, although the Soviet-German war has become more intense in recent days, and American oil tankers in the South Atlantic have continued to fall victim to Nazi actions, it is difficult to shift people's interest and attention away from the Far East.</p>
<p>In the past, Japan has constantly claimed that it is being surrounded, but that was just an excuse for its preparations for expansion. At that time, the democratic countries in the Far East were indeed exposed in an isolated and unprepared state. British and American Far East defenses were constantly being strengthened, but there was a lack of planned joint action, and especially with regard to China, which was fighting hard against Japan, the necessary connection was never established. After the formation of the Tripartite Pact, Britain and the United States began to consider emergency preparations in the Far East. Concrete measures were taken after Japan's advance into Vietnam this summer. As the situation has developed to this point, Japan has reached the maximum extent of its peaceful southward advance. Strategically, it has indeed seized the convenience of advancing and retreating freely, but it is clearly not enough to cope with the combined strength of the ABCD powers, so there has been hesitation and prudence in the last two months. On the other hand, it is attempting to lift the economic pressure by conducting negotiations with the United States. This is a retreat to advance, and it is also looking forward to the resolution of the war against China and the final outcome of the Soviet-German war. However, judging from the general trend, Japan is already in a state similar to suffocation, and its strength can only be consumed and weakened. Even if it implements all possible economic mobilization plans, it is difficult to expect significant improvements. As for the strength of the ABCD line-up in the Far East, it is being actively strengthened, and it will be further strengthened with the advancement of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act and defense programs. If it is said that the Axis should be defeated by starting with its weakest link, the recent Far East happens to meet this condition.</p>
<p>Among the democratic powers, their concern and preparation for the Far East have indeed reached the highest level, but their view of defeating the Nazis above all else still seems unchanged, as evidenced by the fact that U.S.-Japan negotiations are still in a state of being "藕断丝连" (connected like a broken lotus root). According to the conversation between Duff Cooper and Brooke-Popham, the former stated that both Britain and the United States do not want the war to spread to the Pacific, while the latter clearly stated that war in the Far East is the last step in the eyes of the British, and Hitler is the great enemy of the British. From this, it can be seen that the various measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East are still essentially passive, in other words, they are waiting for the belligerents to take action before reluctantly rising up to respond, and at the very least, they are not immediately preparing to take active measures to seek a thorough clarification of the dangerous situation in the Far East; and the hope that Japan will come to its senses, even if extremely weak, has not yet been abandoned. For this reason, it is necessary to avoid some necessary measures that may offend Japan, such as the fact that Britain and the United States have never engaged in cooperation with the Soviet Union in the Far East, and it seems that both Britain and the United States are deliberately avoiding this. The Nazis are naturally the great enemy of the democratic countries, and the Nazi henchmen with sinister intentions should not be tolerated, especially. Recently, Hitler launched another large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, and the Japanese army has also reorganized its offensive in China. It is not known whether this is a planned conspiracy. Hitler's recent speech that French-Japanese relations are improving should not be taken lightly. In order to be prepared for all eventualities, Britain and the United States have the necessity to consider more active and proactive measures and steps in the Far East.</p>
<h3>British Military Personnel Deeply Impressed by Chinese Army After Battle of Northern Hunan; Japanese Invitation to Foreign Reporters in Shanghai to Inspect Changsha Becomes a Laughing Stock in London News Circles</h3>
<p>London (Delayed): British military personnel have a very deep impression of the strength shown by the Chinese army in the Battle of Northern Hunan. The Japanese invitation to foreign reporters in Shanghai to inspect (Japanese-occupied Changsha) has become a laughing stock in London news circles. Japanese Cabinet spokesman Ishii initially made exaggerated statements, and when someone later asked what impact the Battle of Northern Hunan would have on U.S.-Japan talks, he only replied that "Please ask the U.S. government." The different tones before and after are quite interesting. The Japanese defeat has greatly weakened its (powerful military force). In the eyes of people in Britain and allied countries, the so-called (powerful military force) of the Japanese is not worth mentioning. On the contrary, China has raised the prestige of Chinese generals and soldiers with its achievements based on facts, not just empty words. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreign Reporters Arrive in Guilin, Transfer to Hunan for Inspection</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received by the official Central News Agency today, a group of foreign reporters heading to the front lines of Changsha arrived in Guilin by plane last night. These people took the train north to Hunan and are scheduled to arrive at the Chinese military headquarters today. Among these people are U.S. Embassy Military Attaché Colonel MacGuire, British Embassy Colonel Fletcher, TASS's Yakov Semin, United Press's Fisher, Associated Press's Mosa, Reuters' Zhao Jun Sydney, Morning Post's MacDonald, and Central News Agency's Lu. The Soviet military attaché canceled his trip at the last minute because the plane was full and he was unable to bring his Russian translator. (5th dispatch from Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Guo Sets National Day for Reception of Foreign Guests</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi has set the afternoon of National Day to hold a large-scale tea party to receive foreign guests, and personnel from embassies and consulates of various countries, as well as foreign personnel serving in public and private institutions here, have been invited. Although the reason has not been stated, it is believed to be to welcome the U.S. military delegation led by General Magruder, so government authorities will also participate at that time. (5th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Sets National Day for English Broadcast</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In addition to the announced programs for the celebration of National Day in Chongqing, the following items will be added: (1) Gliding performance, performed by 1,000 students who graduated from the Gliding Training Class on the 1st of this month, coming from Chengdu to Chongqing to perform. (2) 30 million tablets of quinine donated by overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have arrived, and a ceremony will be held on that day to present the medicine to the Military Affairs Commission, which will be accepted by Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin on behalf of the commission. In addition, Madame Chiang will deliver a speech in English via broadcast on that day. (4th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Henan Land Tax Changed to Collection of In-Kind, to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>Luoyang: Preparations for the change of Henan land tax to collection of in-kind are complete, and collection will begin on the 16th. The Provincial Land Tax Management Office has assigned 20 supervisors to depart for various counties within days to conduct publicity and guidance. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Affected by Freezing Order, Commercial Activity Depressed</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to statistics published here, Tianjin is one of the major Chinese commercial ports most severely affected by the freezing order. Tianjin has always been a prosperous commercial area, but now it is lifeless. The freezing order has caused goods worth millions of dollars shipped from Tianjin by Japanese ships via Japanese ports to the UK and the US to be stranded in Japan. Taking the leather goods shipped from Tianjin as an example, the goods currently frozen in Kobe are worth about US$750,000, equivalent to more than 15 million Chinese currency. In addition, there are also bristles, peanuts, carpets, eggs, and other items. Currently, Japanese shipping companies do not have ships traveling between the US and Japan, so the only way to remedy the situation is to send ships from the US to load the goods. However, this is a matter that needs to be discussed between the US and Japanese governments. Although merchants are running around busily, the prospect of transporting goods to their destination or shipping them back to Shanghai from Japan to await transfer by US ships is very bleak.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Prepares to Form Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In order to facilitate overseas Chinese investment in the motherland, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is preparing to form a large-scale Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company to engage in various industrial, mining, and agricultural businesses. It will also handle investment entrusted by overseas Chinese. The total capital amount has not yet been determined, but the government may contribute 40% of the total amount as an initiative. Overseas Chinese subscriptions will be calculated in US dollars, with each share priced at ten dollars. According to sources from the Commission, overseas Chinese interest in domestic investment is growing daily. The Cuban Chinese Chamber of Commerce plans to invest one million US dollars, and overseas Chinese in Peru are also initiating the establishment of a South American Overseas Chinese Enterprise Company.

<h3>Briefings</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The China Development Bank has decided to establish a branch in Chongqing, with Luo Tanghua in charge of preparations. They have already purchased a building in the commercial center and are undertaking repairs, with plans to open within the year. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>British and German POW Exchange Postponed</h3>
<p>London Official Announcement: Hess Will Not Be Returned</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th: An official announcement last night stated that the exchange of British and German prisoners of war, scheduled to take place today in the English Channel, has been postponed due to various difficult issues. The declaration stated that the issue lies in Germany's request to change the British organization for returning German prisoners of war. In response to inquiries regarding Hess, the third Nazi to fly to Scotland, he is not included in this prisoner exchange. The declaration explained that international law does not include individual detainees, only those within the scope of prisoners of war. It also stated that both sides are now considering when this exchange can be realized. Reuters, London, 5th: Last night, it was learned that the reason for the temporary suspension of the exchange of wounded prisoners between Britain and Germany was that the German government, in the final negotiations, pointed out that the number of German prisoners of war being returned was less than that of British prisoners of war, and therefore requested that German civilian prisoners also be included, but not as a necessary condition for the exchange of prisoners. The British government replied that it had long declared its willingness to mutually repatriate men and women of age and children over military service age. In order to express this intention, it is willing to return the first batch of 60 German civilians along with sick and wounded German soldiers. On Friday, the German government replied that the German side needed a little more time to consider the British reply and was not prepared to proceed with the exchange of prisoners in accordance with the original plan. If the British side does not receive a satisfactory reply by Sunday, the German prisoners of war in the hospital ship will disembark and take a short rest. The British authorities are simultaneously carrying out the necessary arrangements for the return of the first batch of German civilians. It is estimated that 50 German women, all supporters of Hitler, left the concentration camp in the Isles of Man and arrived in London yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The British War Office stated yesterday that 300 Indian soldiers captured by the enemy, all from the state of Punjab and of the Hindu faith, are now being detained in a large prisoner-of-war camp in Germany. They are admired by the German guards for their carefulness, cleanliness, and orderliness. Most are assigned to labor, especially in agriculture, while others serve in industries such as painting, bricklaying, road repair, and papermaking. Their treatment appears to be good. One concentration camp in a small village has various entertainment and sports facilities.</p>

<h3>Soviet Forces Fighting Along Entire Front, Situation Extremely Tense, Nazi Offensive Focused on Both Flanks, Soviet Counter-Offensive Against Central Sector</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report stating that on the 4th, our army fought the enemy along the entire front. On the 2nd, 51 enemy aircraft and 2 observation balloons were shot down in air combat, and our side lost 19 aircraft. On the 3rd, three enemy aircraft were shot down at the mouth of Moscow, and on the 4th, five were shot down. An enemy cargo ship was sunk in the Barents Sea.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: A Reuters military commentator stated that the Soviet situation has now reached an extremely tense stage. To understand this situation, the entire front must be viewed as one large battlefield. The final decision in this war has not yet arrived. The Nazi attack is currently focused on both flanks of the Soviet front, while the Soviet army is launching a major counter-offensive against the central sector of the German front, making slow and steady progress. Smolensk is surrounded and under threat. The Soviet army is currently at both extremes of its battle line, one near Leningrad in the north and the other east of Poltava and on the Crimean Isthmus in the south, responding to fierce attacks with local, forceful counter-offensives and strong defenses. The Nazis have mobilized all available troops, artillery, and tanks in an attempt to achieve results in these two major attacks. The final reserves are now almost fully mobilized. The outcome of this battle is still uncertain. This is a critical period for both sides as they engage in all-out fighting. However, the Soviet Union is not without hope and has the possibility of a major victory. If that is the case, the final outcome of the war and its duration will be decisively influenced. Even if the Soviet army achieves only a minor victory in this battle, it will not mean a complete loss of the war, because the Nazis' fate is not tied to this battle in the same way.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Today marks the 16th week of the Soviet-German War. According to reports from both sides and other war news, the battle situation on all fronts can be summarized as follows: (1) After six weeks of encirclement, the defenders of Leningrad are not only able to hold firm but also seize opportunities to counter-attack. According to Moscow dispatches, new Soviet tanks have joined the fighting in the area, which shows their determination. On the island of Hango, west of the city, German forces are also encountering strong Soviet resistance. The Soviet fleet claims that 16 small islands in the vicinity are now occupied by Soviet troops. (2) Moscow also reported today that Soviet forces have achieved new local victories in the central sector. When the Soviet army discovers the enemy's weakness, it launches counter-attacks at several locations simultaneously. The Nazis are attempting to stop the Soviet army with tanks, aircraft, and heavy artillery, but they are no match for the Soviet Air Force's fierce attacks and are retreating. The Soviet army is still pressing the enemy and attempting to reach their lines of communication. (3) The German forces in Ukraine have made the most progress. After 13 weeks of bloody fighting, they have captured Kiev. The situation in northern Ukraine is still quite critical. The German forces are now launching their main force toward Kharkiv, but the Soviet army will fight with all its might for every inch of land. (4) Since General Butny launched a large-scale counter-offensive in Crimea, there has been fierce fighting on the mainland north of the peninsula. The Soviet army is attacking Perekop from the northwest in an attempt to cut off the German forces fighting on the isthmus. The German side has apparently seen this danger and has therefore deployed a large number of reinforcements to join the fighting there. The Soviet naval air force is currently providing great assistance to the Crimean defenders. According to the Soviet Information Bureau, the total losses of the Soviet and German forces are as follows: (1) Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and missing: 1,128,000 men, 7,000 tanks, 8,900 artillery pieces, and 5,300 aircraft. (2) German soldiers killed, wounded, and missing: over 3,000,000 men, 11,000 tanks, 13,000 artillery pieces, and 9,000 aircraft.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 5th: The fate of the Soviet forces fighting desperately to defend the approaches to Crimea has not yet been announced today. High command only announced indirectly that the Red Army continued to resist on the entire front overnight, but Izvestia stated that the German 183rd Infantry Division and the 89th Regiment were annihilated while fighting in a certain sector of the western front. Soviet forces recovered nine villages occupied by German forces and seized vehicles, machinery, and military supplies. The Red Army is continuing to pursue the German forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 5th, from the German Führer's Headquarters: The German military report this afternoon stated that the Eastern European war is progressing smoothly. In southern Ukraine, a German division is engaged in fierce fighting with entrenched Soviet forces. German forces cleared the remaining enemy forces south of the mouth of the Dnieper River and on small islands in the Black Sea, capturing 12,000 Soviet soldiers and seizing 34 tanks, 179 artillery pieces, and 472 machine guns. German troops captured the island of Abrulka. Finnish forces continue to advance in eastern Karelia. Last night, the German Air Force bombed important armaments factories southeast of Kharkiv and military installations in Moscow and Leningrad.</p>
<h3>German Offensive Near Murmansk Thwarted</h3>
<p>TASS, 5th, from the Northern Front Near Murmansk: Near Murmansk, two German regiments forcibly crossed the Licha River and consolidated their defenses on the east bank in order to attack the ice-free port of Murmansk. The Red Army was ordered to attack, surrounded the enemy forces, and drove them out of the east bank. Under heavy Red Army artillery fire, the German 138th and 139th Regiments suffered heavy losses. Hundreds of German soldiers drowned while trying to escape during the river crossing. The 139th Regiment was almost completely wiped out, and its headquarters was also destroyed. The enemy suffered 1,500 dead and several thousand wounded. There are now no enemy traces on the east bank of the Licha River.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: A Pravda correspondent in Leningrad reported: "In this war to defend Leningrad, the Soviet tank units have made great contributions. Recently, in a village near Leningrad, Morozov's tank unit annihilated 150 enemies. Tanks led by Savelyev have also repeatedly attacked enemy positions. In tank battles, the Soviet Union has consistently demonstrated superior combat effectiveness. On one occasion, Rasumov's tank was attacked by three enemy tanks. Although the odds were greatly against him, he fought back bravely and eventually destroyed two enemy tanks, while the other retreated hastily."</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 5th: A Pravda correspondent in Leningrad reported that the defenders of Leningrad are now using new types of tanks, which are formidable weapons, to counter the German mechanized forces, with considerable effect. These new weapons are manufactured in Leningrad itself and are still in production.</p>
<p>TASS, Stockholm, 5th: Military circles here say that General Leeb, commander of the German forces attacking Leningrad, has submitted his resignation to Hitler, but Hitler has rejected it because Leeb has not yet completed the tasks assigned by high command.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 5th: Izvestia reported yesterday that, according to news from Leningrad, the Soviet army had won a major victory after fierce fighting near the town of Garrian-Ismails at point "B". This area is a key point on the German front line, and therefore the Soviet victory has eliminated the threat to Leningrad. The report also mentioned that Finnish forces have strengthened their defense lines to use as a base for attacking Soviet positions. It is reported that the Soviet army has carefully prepared a counter-offensive, using artillery to destroy Finnish machine gun emplacements, concrete bunkers, and bridges. Heavy tanks flattened defensive structures, and Finnish soldiers fled from burning houses. The report stated that the troops commanded by Major Pelsnok-Tsekai had captured an important area of the Finnish defenses. There was also fierce street fighting in the battle, and the Soviet army captured a large amount of war materiel.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Soviet Counter-Offensive Launched in the Staryno Area</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Although recent German communiqués announced heavy aerial bombardments of Moscow and Leningrad on Friday, they remained vague about the large-scale war in progress, without mentioning any place names. Therefore, there is no way to confirm Hitler's prediction of a major battle on the Eastern Front. According to London sources, Soviet General Butny has launched a large-scale counter-offensive, moving out from the direction of Staryno, aimed at pinning down the German flanking offensive in Crimea. Although German forces have entered the southern end of the Perekop Isthmus, they have so far failed to reach the Crimean positions. The result of the current Soviet counter-offensive is unknown, but if it is successful, it will be a first-rate military tactic.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Red Army defending Odessa launched a counter-offensive against enemy forces near the city yesterday, achieving remarkable results. In addition to annihilating a large number of enemy troops, they also captured 45 artillery pieces and many machine guns.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Red Army on the Southwestern Front launches frequent attacks. In one sector, the Red Army inflicted heavy damage on an enemy motorized unit yesterday. The spoils of war included 500 military vehicles and 250 motorcycles. On the other hand, 650 enemy officers and soldiers were killed by landmines on the Southern Front.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: After several days of fierce fighting, the Red Army on the Southern Front inflicted heavy damage on the Romanian 8th Cavalry Brigade and the German 399th Infantry Regiment. The enemy suffered hundreds of casualties. Our army also captured three tanks, 20 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns, thousands of shells, and many other war supplies.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: Near Poltava on the Southern Front, the Soviet Air Force annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry and destroyed four enemy tanks and 44 trucks. In air combat, four German aircraft were destroyed. Also, in the N area, our air force annihilated two enemy transports and destroyed 45 military vehicles and six artillery pieces.</p>
<h3>Hull Condemns Germany After Sinking of "W. C. Teagle," "Lawless Like a Pirate," Must Be Dealt with from a Self-Defense Perspective</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th: Secretary of State Hull, while hosting reporters yesterday, specifically authorized reporters to relay his original words, saying, "The sinking of the "W. C. Teagle" appears to be a lawless, pirate-like act, aimed at intimidation. This kind of behavior is related to the general movement of expelling others from the Atlantic Ocean, and this movement is part of a world conquest movement." Hull answered reporters' questions, saying that regardless of what flag the "W. C. Teagle" flew, and regardless of whether it was under our escort, all countries have the inherent right to self-defense to deal with attacks aimed at conquering the world. In such extraordinary circumstances, acts that violate international law must be dealt with from a self-defense perspective. The United States must implement a policy of vigorously supplying Britain with what it needs. Every time a submarine sinks a ship carrying American supplies, the American aid-to-Britain policy is affected. If we were to say that the ships sunk were flying neutral flags, and therefore we could not take any action, then our aid-to-Britain policy would become a bubble. Secretary Hull made the above remarks in response to reporters' inquiries about the Standard Oil Company's claim that the "W. C. Teagle" was registered in Panama, but had been transferred to Britain, and that the ship was under British orders when it was torpedoed. Hull continued, saying that when aggressor nations move into certain new areas to conquer them, part of their plan is to seize control of the high seas, and then we recognize the right of all nations to self-defense. If such a plan succeeds, no country will be able to defend itself. Hull also said that he had not read Hitler's recent speech because he determined that there was absolutely nothing new in his speech, and that he could not at this time imitate his actions and make empty pronouncements. It is reported that the "W. C. Teagle," which encountered misfortune on its way from South America to South Africa, was the eighth American merchant ship to be sunk since the outbreak of the European war. News of this incident reached the American capital on the day that government leaders were trying to lobby Congress to amend the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: It has just been learned that 34 of the 38 crew members of the American ship "W. C. Teagle," which was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean recently, have been rescued.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th: Secretary of State Hull said that the sinking of the "W. C. Teagle" by a torpedo on September 27 in the American neutrality zone was more serious than previous ship sinkings.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th: Administrative leaders stated yesterday that they firmly believe that the torpedo attack on the "W. C. Teagle" oil tanker strengthened President Roosevelt's determination to ask Congress to amend the Neutrality Act. Alabama Democratic Congressman Hill said that the sinking of the ship indicated the Nazis' clear determination to drag the Western Hemisphere into the war. This is another warning to our country. We should abandon all appeasement and take every possible step to defend our country.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Bombing of Germany as Prelude to Invasion of Europe, Halifax Addresses Reporters for the First Time After Returning to Washington</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th: British Ambassador Halifax, after returning to his post from England, met with reporters for the first time yesterday. He expressed gratitude for American aid and described in detail the current state of British defenses and the reasons why Britain, in its current state, cannot invade the European continent. He said that the British, like the Americans, feel that Britain should take advantage of the three-month hiatus in German air activity in England to send troops to invade the European continent. However, current shipping and equipment are not sufficient to carry out such a large-scale operation. Now, the only option is to bomb Germany on a large scale to create conditions that will allow the war to end sooner. This is also the best way to reduce the pressure on the Soviet Union and prevent German fighters from being deployed entirely on the Soviet front. Therefore, the production of heavy bombers is of paramount importance. One bomber delivered this year is better than two or three delivered next year. As for Hitler's recent speech, he has not yet read it in full. He feels that Hitler's words are merely intended to boost German morale in preparation for the winter war. In fact, no one in London believes Hitler's claim that the war against the Soviet Union is proceeding according to plan.</p>
<h3>US President Schedules Meeting with Congressional Leaders Tomorrow to Discuss Amending or Repealing the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 4th: Political figures here say that President Roosevelt is scheduled to meet with leading members of both the House and Senate in the White House on the 7th to discuss the issue of amending or repealing the Neutrality Act. Although this matter is of great importance, it is rumored that President Roosevelt has not yet made a final decision. It is believed that the President hopes that the House of Representatives will quickly pass other proposals that can be put forward in the future and that he is also preparing to make some concessions to the opposition. It is expected that the proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act, although not entirely to his liking, will at least require that the clause prohibiting the arming of American merchant ships be abolished. Both houses will generally agree to this. However, if the President requests that the clause prohibiting American merchant ships from sailing to belligerent ports and traveling in war zones also be abolished, the isolationists will inevitably rise up in opposition.</p>
<h3>British Troops Concentrated on Turkish Border</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 5th: According to neutral reporters, who arrived here from Cairo via Beirut, many British troops are moving through Palestine and Syria toward the Turkish border. A large army, including Polish, Czech, Greek, Indian, Serbian, Dutch, and other nationalities of soldiers, has been concentrated in northern Syria.</p>
<h3>Taylor Returns to New York with Valuable Information</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: Roosevelt's personal envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned here yesterday. He told Reuters that he was carrying extremely valuable information, which he would report to the President and Secretary of State Hull. This information was obtained from his meetings with many relevant people overseas. It is believed that Taylor will visit the President at Hyde Park, as the President has come to New York for private matters and is now at his residence in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>British Aircraft Attack Military Targets</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The Air Ministry issued a communiqué yesterday describing the activities of the British Air Force on Friday night. It stated that British bombers attacked dockyards in Dunkirk, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Brest last night, hitting their targets. British coastal aircraft also attacked targets such as the Aalborg airfield in Denmark. British fighters, during offensive patrols at dusk, attacked an enemy airfield in northern France with small cannons and machine gun fire. One British coastal aircraft is missing.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 5th: Recent British Air Force communiqués state that on the nights of Thursday and Friday, British heavy bombers again attacked the port and ships of Benghazi, and strafed enemy transport vehicles on the roads. Bardia was also subjected to continuous night attacks, causing large fires and significant damage. The city was also heavily bombed by the South African Air Force during the day. British fighters were also very active, engaging several German aircraft in the Sidi Barrani area and damaging several German aircraft. Four British aircraft are missing from the above-mentioned raids.</p>
<h3>Seven More Czechs Shot, Yugoslav Guerrillas Capture German Officers and Soldiers as Hostages</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: German authorities are working hard to destroy all resistance in the occupied countries, so Nazi executioners and secret police have continued to work tirelessly in the past 24 hours. According to a wireless telegram from Prague, seven more Czechs have been executed recently, including former Prague Mayor Dr. Krabga, who, after being sentenced to death on Friday, preferred to be executed rather than beg for mercy. One of the seven was Colonel Balaban, whom the Germans considered to be a member of the revolutionary organization. Three of the seven were Jews, who were accused of hiding weapons and were all shot. Meanwhile, according to Vichy sources, six so-called communists in France have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to twenty years in Douai.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 5th: CBS broadcast a British wireless message yesterday stating that Yugoslav guerrillas had captured 65 German soldiers, including at least 40 officers, and were holding them hostage. If the Germans continue to kill Yugoslavs, these German officers and soldiers will also be executed. The wireless message stated that, according to a telegram from Prague, five Polish school children have been sentenced to eight years of hard labor.</p>
<h3>German Overseas Chinese Arrive in Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 5th: German overseas Chinese from Iran, led by the German Minister to Iran, arrived yesterday at the Bulgarian border town of Svirengrad. The Bulgarian Minister to Iran, the Hungarian Chargé d'Affaires to Iran, and embassy staff also arrived in Bulgaria. The Italian Minister and expatriates will arrive in the city today. The Bulgarian authorities have sent a special envoy to welcome them.</p>
<h3>German Military Announces Sinking Statistics</h3>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 5th - The German High Command announced that in September, a total of 682,000 tons of British merchant ships were sunk. Among them, German submarines sank 452,000 tons, torpedo boats sank 38,500 tons, and the air force sank 19,000 tons. The losses of Soviet merchant ships are not included. To date, the total number of British ships sunk has reached 10,230,000 tons, of which 75% were sunk by submarines. The Italian naval and air force attack on British ships in the Western Mediterranean was the most significant event of the past week. A British convoy, protected by the battleship HMS Nelson and other aircraft carriers and warships, was spotted by Italian reconnaissance aircraft near Sicily. The Italian naval and air forces immediately launched an attack, sinking two large merchant ships (3,000 tons). In addition, two heavy cruisers and one light cruiser were sunk by torpedoes. The battleship HMS Nelson was also hit by a torpedo and damaged. Another battleship, six cruisers, and one destroyer were also hit by torpedoes in succession. Eight Italian aircraft did not return. In another incident, a German submarine attacked a convoy in the Mediterranean, sinking twelve ships. In the Atlantic, a 12,000-ton oil tanker was sunk, followed by the sinking of three merchant ships and one oil tanker, totaling 28,000 tons. In addition, the German and Finnish navies actively laid minefields near Kronstadt.</p>
<h3>Iraqi Prime Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Reuter, 5th - A report from Beirut states that Iraqi Prime Minister Matfa has resigned. The Iraqi Ambassador to Egypt, Nori, has been summoned back to Baghdad and has departed by plane. It is noted that Mr. Matfa took office as Prime Minister in March of this year.</p>
<h3>Results of the Moscow Conference: Joint Strategy Decided; U.S. Aid to the Soviet Union to Become More Practical and Expanded; Soviet Union Regards the Conference as a Blow to Germany</h3>
<p>TASS, London, 5th - British newspapers are focusing on the results of the Three-Power Conference. All evening papers carried the full text of Molotov's speech at the conference. The Standard Evening News headlined Molotov's speech with "Hitler's Plans Destroyed" and "Decisive Cooperation Between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States." The News Chronicle's headline was "Molotov Vows to Fight to the End, Three Powers Will Defeat Hitler." All morning papers and diplomatic observers have written articles commenting on the resolutions of the Three-Power Conference. The News Chronicle's diplomatic observer, Clemence, said that the Moscow Conference has established a solid foundation for cooperation and has gained a broad new understanding. The Times stated that the main task now is to immediately implement the results that have been achieved. The paper pointed out that the close alliance of the three powers has hindered Hitler's conspiracy to defeat them one by one. According to The Times' diplomatic observer, the Moscow Three-Power Conference planned a strategy to achieve victory, namely, strengthening the Eastern front while applying pressure on Germany in other areas. The Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post wrote that the Moscow Conference will occupy an important page in history, as it has decided on a powerful joint strategy for the cooperating countries.</p>
<p>TASS, New York, 5th - American newspapers have widely commented on the Moscow Three-Power Conference. The Chicago Daily News' correspondent in Moscow, Steele, said that the conclusion of the conference was particularly swift and that, in addition to material cooperation, the conference has promoted new developments in the political relations of the three countries. The New York World-Telegram's correspondent in Washington, Schreiber, said that the heroism of the Russian resistance exceeded Hitler's and Germany's expectations, and the war has become protracted. American aid will influence the outcome. A Sunday newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that the general opinion in Washington is in favor of providing the Soviet Union with the greatest possible assistance, and current aid measures to the Soviet Union are becoming more practical.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th - The resolutions of the Soviet-British-American Three-Power Conference have been supported by all Soviet citizens. Personnel from various factories, companies, and institutions have held meetings to discuss the issue. The military and civilians in the Soviet Far East also welcomed the results of the Three-Power Conference. Red Army personnel Kartchkov said, "Hitler's Germany will soon feel the combined strength of the three powers. In all countries enslaved by fascism, anti-German movements are also expanding. The time for them to rise up and kill the enemy is approaching."</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 5th - Soviet spokesman Lozovsky said yesterday that Hitler's speech on Friday was the clearest indication that the Moscow Three-Power Conference was a major blow to Germany. Hitler felt the need to speak to reassure the people. The most important point in his speech was Hitler's admission of an error in his assessment of Soviet strength. The German reaction to the Moscow Three-Power Conference is very interesting. After the Roosevelt-Churchill sea conference, German propaganda predicted that no further conference would follow. When the names of those attending the Moscow Conference were announced, German radio said that the attendees would inevitably clash. When the Moscow Conference formed a subcommittee, the Germans said that the conference would be bogged down in protracted procedures. Now that the conference has ended in just three days, the Germans have been spreading propaganda that the Moscow Conference has broken down, but at present, they cannot explain the establishment of an agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Unable to say anything else, Hitler is fabricating lies about how heavy the Soviet losses are, which is ridiculous.</p>

<h3>U.S. Defense Spending Greatly Increased; Accounts for 18% of National Income</h3>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 5th - U.S. Budget Director Smith told reporters here yesterday that in the past three months, national income spent on national defense has accounted for over 14%, while in the past fiscal year, defense spending accounted for only 8% of national income. It is expected that in the near future, spending on national defense will reach 18% of national income. The latest estimate is $25 billion more than what was calculated a few months ago. The reason for the increase is the acceleration of defense construction, the rise in certain prices, and the allocation of new funds. According to his estimate, British war expenditure currently accounts for at least 40% of national income, while German war expenditure accounts for 50%. U.S. national income has increased significantly, so even while paying for defense expenditures, a great deal of money is still being used for civil expenses, which is much more than when the defense plan was not adopted. It is expected that by the spring of next year, defense spending will reach $2 billion per month. The total defense expenditure for the fiscal year ending June 1942 will total $18 billion, which does not include the $10 billion used by Britain. As for how much the total defense expenditure will be, Smith declined to comment due to the Lend-Lease program.</p>
<h3>Nomura Visits Hull, Expresses Willingness to Conclude an Agreement with the U.S.; Attempts to Restore Normal Shipping in the Far East</h3>
<p>Reuter, New York, 5th - According to news from Washington, Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura presented an oral note to Secretary of State Hull at the State Department on Friday, the content of which has not been disclosed, but it is known to be related to exploratory U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 5th - Diplomatic circles revealed yesterday that the Japanese proposal to restore limited Pacific shipping is being considered by the U.S. Previously, Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Admiral Nomura told Secretary of State Hull that Tokyo is willing to conclude an agreement with the U.S. to allow a small number of ships from both countries to sail to each other's ports to transport mail and passengers. It is believed here that Tokyo's proposal is the first step towards restoring friendly relations between Japan and the U.S. The Japanese government apparently believes that restoring normal shipping is very important for a general understanding of the Pacific problem.</p>

<h3>Golden Lion Dragon Team Secures Finals Spot: Golden Lions Defeat Rui Tang, Dragon Team Overcomes White Lions</h3>
<p>The Koko Cup charity mini-football semi-finals were held yesterday afternoon at the Poor Children's Education Institute, with nearly two thousand spectators. The first match featured Hong Zhang against Lao Ye. In the first half, Hong Zhang's Zhou Qinxiong established his merit, resulting in Lao Ye losing with a score of 0-2. In the second semi-final, the Dragon Team faced the White Lions. Although the Dragon Team had famous players such as Zhang Lingen and Fei Chunhua, the White Lions originally planned to borrow players from Portugal and Greece, but due to the regulations of the Western Union, Fafan, Smiling England, and others could not assist. The Dragon Team eliminated the White Lions with a score of 5-2, securing a spot in the finals. In the final match, the Golden Lions battled Rui Tang. The Golden Lions had ambitious goals of winning the championship. They had previously conceded defeat three weeks prior, but their strength was formidable. Rui Tang's lineup was also not weak. The battle between the two sides was full of highlights. Ten minutes before the end of the match, Han Longhai passed the ball to Jia Youliang, who raised his foot and shot, sending the ball into the net. In the end, the Golden Lions defeated Rui Tang with a score of 2-0. They are scheduled to compete against the Dragon Team this Wednesday (8th) for the championship.

<h3>Opportunity for Domestic Goods to Sell in Southeast Asia Has Arrived: Promote Trade with the Dutch East Indies, Economic Blockade of Japan by Britain and the United States Intensifies, Overseas Chinese Seize the Opportunity to Capture the Market, After the Interruption of American Cotton to Japan, Indian Cotton is Also Banned from Being Shipped</h3>
<p>A certain gentleman, a prominent figure in the Chinese business community in the Dutch East Indies, who recently came to Shanghai, told reporters yesterday, "The Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have already organized the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee in order to vigorously promote domestic goods. In order to protect local products, the Dutch East Indies authorities have implemented import restrictions. Moreover, due to the recent freezing of Japanese assets, Japanese goods can no longer be dumped in the Dutch East Indies. This measure is beneficial to our country. It is hoped that domestic goods manufacturers can seize this good opportunity and redouble their efforts to capture the Southeast Asian domestic goods market."</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity to Compete in the Market</p>
<p>The gentleman continued, "As for Sino-Dutch trade, we cannot deny that China in the past was neither agricultural nor industrial. Agricultural products relied on imports, and industrial products were also rarely exported. On the other hand, the Dutch East Indies is rich in agricultural products, with abundant coal, oil, and tin mines. The only things it relies on foreign countries for are foreign goods and cloth. However, in the past, China could not compete with Japan in these two areas. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies had a trade surplus with China every year. Now that Japanese goods can no longer be shipped to the Dutch East Indies, domestic goods manufacturers must make good use of this great opportunity, especially in the area of cotton textiles. They must strive to improve quality and increase production. Then the Dutch East Indies market can be obtained easily. The establishment of the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee is for this purpose."</p>
<p>Economic Severance between Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>According to the Japanese "Mainland News", the economic blockade against Japan is becoming increasingly intensified, which has given a shock to the Shanghai economic community. When Britain issued the order to freeze Japanese assets, general observations were quite flexible. Indian cotton, with an annual output of five million dan, was still exported to Japan as usual because it was not applicable to all Indian and British textile machines. However, now it has been banned from being exported to Japan, and the Indian government has announced a permit system for exports to Japan. Therefore, it is not optimistic to say that Indian cotton is imported. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is contrary to the original ideal, making it difficult for Indian cotton to be transported to Japan. Now that the Indian government's opinion is consistent with the strong attitude of the British mainland, it has been determined. At the current stage when the hope of importing American cotton has been cut off, the import of Indian cotton has also been completely cut off. Therefore, what methods will those who need a large amount of cotton cloth in the future use? This is quite difficult."</p>
<p>The Strength of Overseas Chinese is Extremely Substantial</p>
<p>He continued to describe the current situation of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, saying, "The position of the Dutch East Indies in Southeast Asia is more important than Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. Although the number of local Overseas Chinese is small, their economic strength is greater. Therefore, the local government also attaches great importance to our Overseas Chinese. Although the economic strength of Overseas Chinese is great, they also have many shortcomings. The unsoundness of institutions and the lack of new commercial knowledge make it difficult to cope with modern commercial competition. Looking around the whole territory, there is no large enterprise company with a capital of one hundred and several million yuan, and the knowledge of the local people is increasing day by day. If Overseas Chinese do not seek improvement, their past superior position will be destroyed in one day. Therefore, the establishment of the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee is necessary."</p>
<p>Ardently Hope that the Motherland Will Surely Win and Succeed</p>
<p>Finally, when reporters asked about the expectations of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their motherland, it was said that they have the same feelings as Overseas Chinese in other places. First of all, they hope that the motherland will surely win and succeed so that the status of Overseas Chinese will be further improved. They also hope that the authorities can treat returned Overseas Chinese well and protect them properly. Because Overseas Chinese work hard and endure hardship abroad, they want to seek a comfortable life or return home to invest when they return to their country in their later years. Therefore, they hope that the security of the motherland will be improved to guarantee them. In addition, Overseas Chinese are far away from the motherland and are inevitably alienated from the domestic situation. If they want Overseas Chinese capital to move inland, there should be a perfect guidance agency. For example, Hong Kong is a transportation hub for Overseas Chinese to enter and exit. If an agency dedicated to serving Overseas Chinese can be established in Hong Kong to connect the news between the two places, the situation can be changed."</p>
<h3>Gradey: Rumors of a Visit to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Gradey, Assistant Secretary of State of the United States, who is currently stranded in Chongqing and is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong today, will attend the Tripartite Financial Conference in Hong Kong after visiting the central authorities in Chongqing to further strengthen the economic cooperation between the three allied countries and the United States. Before coming to China, Gradey's itinerary originally included a visit to Shanghai after visiting Chongqing to meet with American officials here, investigate economic conditions, and strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions against the Axis powers. Therefore, Gradey may visit Shanghai after the Tripartite Financial Conference. Gradey was ordered to come to the Far East on August 12 to investigate the economy, arriving in Manila by plane from San Francisco. According to sources, Gradey's mission this time is to investigate the pressure exerted by the entire democratic countries on the Axis powers in the Far East, so that the ABCD four powers can strengthen and complete their military defense ties and transport the raw materials of the East to various democratic countries to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Axis powers. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies, Malaysia, Burma, India, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Shanghai are all on the list of inspections.</p>
<h3>British Electric Organization Secretly Checks Tickets</h3>
<p>According to news obtained by the Pingming News Agency reporters yesterday, in order to resolutely stop ticket fraud, the British Electric Car Company has specially instructed several foreign senior staff members to organize a secret inspection team of two or three people each. These personnel have special privileges and can stop the tram at any time, regardless of whether the tram is in motion, and board it to check tickets. If fraud is found, they will be punished according to company rules. It is also learned that the ticket sellers of various trams of the Electric Car Company have seen a reduction in fraud since the incident in which ticket seller Wang Wanxiang pushed and killed Xiang Dongchuan, which caused public outrage and unanimous criticism.</p>
<h3>General Patrol Bowen Will Return to Shanghai Next Spring: Resignation is Not a Fact, Acting General Patrol Smith Specifically Denied Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the death of Special Deputy General Patrol Akagi, who was assassinated, and General Patrol Bowen was on vacation traveling in Canada, the Japanese side has requested the Public Works Bureau to reorganize the police department and expand the authority of the Japanese Deputy General Patrol in an attempt to work side by side with the General Patrol. In order to echo this, the Japanese newspapers quickly promoted that Bowen had resigned and would not return to Shanghai to cancel his vacation. Deputy General Patrol Acting General Patrol Smith said that this was not true and specifically made a statement yesterday to deny it in order to correct the record. It is said, "The recent rumor that General Patrol Bowen has resigned is not true as far as I know. Bowen will definitely return to Shanghai to cancel his vacation by March 17 at the latest. He has no reason to resign and has nothing to do with the special deputy general patrol issue. In the past, all the general patrols have had long vacations and travels. It is unimaginable to say that this is a resignation. The issue of the special deputy general patrol is centered on the authority of the position and is currently being negotiated between the authorities and the Japanese Consulate General."</p>
<h3>Banks Cooperate to Handle Trust Deposits: Guiding Hot Money to Move Inland is Becoming Increasingly Urgent, Deposit Interest is Generous and Dividends Are Given</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that since Britain and the United States froze Chinese funds and the Exchange Stabilization Fund eliminated the black market in Shanghai, the Shanghai exchange market has completely changed. The legal tender exchange rate has been officially set at 5.34375 yuan. All industries that need foreign exchange for legitimate needs can apply to the Exchange Stabilization Fund. After approval, they can exchange foreign exchange. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange market has actually entered the management stage, which is completely different from the free trading of the past. Since foreign exchange transactions have been restricted, it is impossible for abundant hot money to speculate on foreign exchange. Therefore, the way out for Shanghai's hot money has become a major issue.</p>
<p>Guiding Inward Movement is More Urgent Than Before</p>
<p>In the past, the maintenance of the Shanghai legal tender exchange rate was to suppress Shanghai's prices, consolidate the credibility of the legal tender, and indirectly prevent the soaring of prices in the interior due to the economic ties between Shanghai and the interior. Although foreign exchange speculation is no longer possible after the freezing, a large amount of hot money has shifted its target and hoarded goods, and the situation is no less serious than before. Prices in the interior have also been affected. Only by encouraging the movement of hot money inward can prices be suppressed. Therefore, the problem of hot money moving inward is as important as the maintenance of the black market in the past and is even more urgent than before. The four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture have formulated preferential guarantee measures for the movement of hot money inward and are doing their best to handle it.</p>
<p>Banks Have Cooperated Fully</p>
<p>Since this year, some hot money in Shanghai, in view of the unpredictable international situation, has automatically moved inward. As of June, it has reached 85 million yuan, of which April had the most, reaching 30 million yuan. However, the amount of hot money remaining in Shanghai is still huge, totaling 300 million yuan. If it cannot be guided properly, the prices in Shanghai and the interior will be unimaginable in the future. Now all banks are deeply aware of this and have cooperated fully with the government to absorb trust deposits, which will be used by the government in the inland industry. In addition to guaranteeing generous interest rates, depositors will also be given dividends. The funds entrusted for lending will be remitted from Shanghai to the interior and given a premium, and the full amount of legal tender can be collected in the interior upon maturity.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Fund is Insufficient: Scattering Fee to be Increased Starting This Month</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been actively scattering refugees from its various reception centers. As of now, it has reduced from more than 19,000 people to more than 13,000 people. According to the staff of the association, the high cost of living in the city is the biggest reason why the scattering work of the association cannot proceed as scheduled. Because the general refugees are deeply afraid of having no food or shelter once they leave the center, most of them are unwilling to leave.</p>
<p>Relief Fund Doubled The number of refugees currently accommodated by the association has been reduced by more than 6,000 compared with the beginning of this year, but the cost of relief for refugees has to be increased by more than one-half due to rising prices. At the beginning of this year, the average cost for each refugee was set at 10 yuan in national currency, but now it has increased to 16 yuan in national currency. Therefore, the relief for more than 13,000 refugees still requires more than 200,000 yuan per month. The income and expenditure of donations from various places cannot offset each other. Therefore, the citizen group of the association is now trying to raise funds to make up for it.</p>
<p>Incentivizing Departure</p>
<p>Starting this month, in order to encourage refugees to leave the center voluntarily, the association has increased the scattering fee. It is stipulated that adults who leave voluntarily will be given a scattering fee increased from 33 yuan to 50 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan. Children will be given a scattering fee increased from 25 yuan to 38 yuan. It is expected that this measure may encourage some refugees to leave voluntarily. According to the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency, the association has a total of twelve reception centers, including two women and children reception centers, two children reception centers, one disabled reception center, one elderly reception center, and the remaining six centers are for accommodating refugees who are adults and women and children living together.</p>
<h3>Two American Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, two more American ships will arrive here one after another soon. The first ship is the President Coolidge of the American President Lines, which will arrive here for the second time from San Francisco, Honolulu, Little Luzon, and Hong Kong tomorrow. This ship is coming to Shanghai with sufficient cabin space for American expatriates staying in Shanghai. The Coolidge is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one week and then set sail back to the United States. The other ship, the freight ship "Aleiva", represented by the local Fulai Foreign Company, will also arrive in Shanghai directly from Seattle on the 7th of this month. It is reported that the "Aleiva" has a deadweight of 6,551 tons and a net weight of 4,100 tons. It is one of the medium-sized merchant ships among the 200 merchant ships built by the 77th US Congress. It is said that it also carries a large batch of American goods this time.</p>
<h3>Procedure for Obtaining American Passport is Simplified</h3>
<p>The Yulin West News reported that it was learned yesterday that the procedure for obtaining an American passport has been simplified. If the applicant can first obtain a passport from the Canadian immigration authorities and present proof documents issued by the British Consulate, they can obtain a transit passport in this port. According to well-informed sources, this method only applies to people traveling to Canada via the United States and to British and Canadian citizens, and does not apply to applicants immigrating to or traveling to the United States. This newly revised procedure makes passport visas much faster and authorizes the American authorities in this port to issue the necessary passports to people who have proof documents issued by the British authorities in this port.</p>
<h3>Soviet Overseas Chinese Donate Money to Comfort the Troops: British Women Assist</h3>
<p>According to the Soviet agency in Shanghai for collecting donations to comfort the troops, as of the 4th of this month, it has received a total of 15,000 yuan in Chinese legal currency and other comforting items, mostly donated by Soviet Overseas Chinese groups. There are also a large number of items such as soap, cigarettes, and socks, mostly donated by poor Russian expatriates. The Moscow Bank has also abandoned receiving 130,000 yuan of comfort money.</p>
<p>Clothes Transported to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Russian Daily News published that 1,000 pairs of socks and 1,000 pieces of underwear will now be transported from Shanghai to the front-line Red Army to keep them warm. All Soviet Red Cross Society's soliciting and comforting goods committee will try to transport them to Hong Kong and then transfer them to Suzhou. Those who transport comfort goods here include Chinese, British, American, Russian, French, Polish, Australian, and German Jewish refugees. In addition to the Moscow Bank, the Russian Daily News and the Soviet Union Club in Shanghai accept donations. Every little bit helps, and it is hoped that all walks of life will donate.</p>
<p>British Women Sympathize</p>
<p>The British Women's Association sympathizes with the Soviet Red Army for fighting against aggression and defending the territory. Since the weather is already in the dead of winter and snow has fallen in the Soviet Union, the front-line Red Army needs winter clothes to protect themselves from the cold. Therefore, they also wrote to the Russian Daily News, stating that the association is launching a campaign to solicit comfort goods and is also raising underwear, socks, and other items to assist the Soviet Red Cross Society in collecting enough.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Prices Have Fallen</h3>
<p>The market prices of various smoke white coal, lump coal, and cinder in Shanghai are hovering, and it is difficult to be rampant. The coal ball factory's disk has opened as low as 315-6 yuan per ton, but there are still few inquiries. In particular, the coal ball business of various firewood and charcoal firms is only half of what it used to be. The reason is that after the coal ball price broke a new record, various users have saved money or switched to burning kerosene and firewood.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants in Shanghai Receive Letters from Branches: Recalling Before and After the Recapture of Fuzhou: A Large Number of Tea Leaves and Warehouse Goods Have Been Lost: American Consul's Car Hit by 18 Bullets</h3>
<p>The "Zi Lin Bao" reported that a certain foreign merchant firm in Fuzhou sent a letter to the Shanghai firm on September 8, stating that when the Japanese army withdrew from Fuzhou, they took away all the goods stored in various warehouses. When American Consul Wright and Mr. Bixu Pu of the Christian Church drove through the city, they were strafed by a Japanese plane. Fortunately, they were not injured. The letter said in brief:</p>
<p>Missing Goods Worth Millions</p>
<p>On August 27, it was heard that the Japanese army had entered Sandu'ao, and some goods stored in the Asiatica Oil Company's godown in that port, and boxed tea leaves stored in the surrounding areas, worth millions of yuan, had been lost. On August 28 and 29, all the goods stored in the Qingji Tea godown were transported away. At 6 pm on the 29th, the Japanese army completely withdrew from the Nantai district. At 1 am on August 30, a fire suddenly broke out in a village on the outskirts of the city. Nearby fire trucks rushed to put out the fire, but were blocked by the Japanese army's cordon. At 9 am on the same day, the Japanese army withdrew from the Japanese schools and clubs next to the Asiatica Oil Company. Before leaving, they dismantled and took away all the wood from the doors, windows, tables, chairs, and floors in the house. From August 3 to September 2, a large number of goods were continuously loaded onto ships at the new dock across the river and transported down the river. At 2 pm on September 2, the Japanese army traveled down the river on 38 steamships, and several fishing boats carried Japanese Chinese along with them. It was known that the Japanese army was indeed withdrawing, because the Chinese army was heavily gathered at the foot of the mountains on the outskirts of the city, and it was extremely difficult for the Japanese army to cope. At about 1:30 am on September 2.</p>
<p>Militia Fiercely Fought Explosions in the City</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison near the Fuzhou! Gate was surrounded by the vanguard of the Chinese army (militia). A fierce battle ensued. At 4:30 am, a violent explosion occurred in the city. The reason was unknown. It was probably the signal set by the Japanese to order the rearguard troops to retreat to the new wharf for the final retreat. At 9:30 am, a Japanese ship in the river sounded its whistle three times and sped towards Mawei with troops. At 10 am, there was no Japanese soldier in Fuzhou and Nantai. At the same time, the militia poured into the city from all sides, numbering thousands. They were the vanguard of the regular army, many of whom were Fuzhou students. At about 11:30 am on September 3.</p>
<p>Bullets Entered the Carriage and Hit the Key</p>
<p>American Consul Wright and Mr. Bixu Ai of the Christian Church drove past the, on their way to visit Pastor Hua Lin, the principal of the high school outside Ximen. Suddenly, they were strafed by a Japanese seaplane. Although there were no markings on the car, there were only six cars left in Fuzhou, all of which were owned by foreigners. Eighteen bullets hit the car. One bullet penetrated the carriage and hit a bunch of keys in the trouser pocket of Bishi, the driver, grazing his body. The two were fortunate not to suffer other injuries. After a short pause, they drove forward and met Bi Lin. They learned that Bi's school had also been strafed. It was heard that the Japanese army had withdrawn from Mawei that afternoon, but thick smoke was seen billowing from the direction of the Mawei Arsenal. It was soon learned that the arsenal had been burned down that morning, and the residence of the naval academy's naval general and supervisor and other residences in the mountains behind the arsenal had also been burned down. The main force of the Japanese army retreated from Mawei towards Jianfeng at 9:30 am, leaving only one transport ship to wait for the Japanese army withdrawing from Fuzhou. As soon as the Japanese army withdrew, the residents of Mawei returned home. Two hours later, two Japanese seaplanes flew low and strafed, and dropped four bombs on the crowded market area, killing more than 20 people and seriously injuring more than 30 people. Dr. Jillette of the hospital in that area did his best to treat them. Many of the seriously injured died. The residents of Mawei said that the first attack by the Japanese plane was because they refused to set off firecrackers when the Japanese army withdrew. In the evening.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Militia with Firecrackers</p>
<p>People gathered in the mountains and on the streets of, welcoming the orderly militia and giving them gifts of tea, meals, and paper, and the sound of firecrackers was incessant. The party flag was flying everywhere, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. At 8 am the next morning, Japanese seaplanes bombed and strafed the old county government and barracks in Dongjie. At 10:30 am, two more Japanese seaplanes flew from Mawei and strafed, but there were no casualties. Then, three Japanese land twin-engine bombers scattered leaflets in the city and then went to Guling, where the seaplanes dropped four bombs before flying towards Mawei. On the night of the day and the 3rd and 4th, the firefighters automatically patrolled the streets to maintain order. Military officers also visited the city one after another. From the 4th, the city situation returned to calm.</p>

<h3>The Bodyguard and Driver of Ji Juemi Arrested for Stealing Documents; Two Others Arrested and Released; Incident Due to Misunderstanding, Ji Does Not Intend to Prosecute</h3>
<p>The Times reports that seven hours after the death of Luo Jialing, the wife of Jewish tycoon Silas Hardoon, the bodyguard of Ji Juemi, compradore of Hardoon &amp; Co., was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department in connection with the theft of important documents from Hardoon &amp; Co. at 221 Nanjing Road. The bodyguard was still detained at the Central Police Station last night and has not yet been publicly prosecuted.</p>
<p>Entered the House and Stole Documents</p>
<p>The removal of the documents occurred between 10:30 PM and 11:00 PM on Friday (the 3rd). At that time, there were three Chinese, one of whom was identified as Ji's bodyguard, and another as his chauffeur, who took the opportunity to sneak into the Hardoon &amp; Co. office. Two employees were inside, already asleep. The watchman heard a noise and got up to investigate, immediately reporting it to nearby detectives, and stating that he witnessed three people throwing a paper package from the back window onto the roof of a neighboring building. The three then jumped from the window onto the roof of the neighboring building and escaped by car.</p>
<p>The Three Arrested Released</p>
<p>Afterward, an informant rushed to Ji Juemi's Hardoon Villa on Jing'an Temple Road, met with Mr. Ji, and then returned to the original location, bringing the bodyguard, chauffeur, and a Chinese person to the Central Police Station. After questioning, the three led the police to a neighboring building of Hardoon &amp; Co., produced a paper package, with a special symbol stamped on it, which was rumored to be important documents related to the Hardoon estate. The paper package was kept by the police last night. The two Chinese were detained overnight and released yesterday morning (the 4th).</p>
<p>Incident Due to Misunderstanding, Lawsuit Withdrawn</p>
<p>However, according to reliable police officers, the bodyguard was still detained at the police station yesterday. According to another senior police officer, the matter has now been clarified as a misunderstanding, so the bodyguard will be released immediately, and all documents returned to Ji. It is said that Ji had sent the three to the Hardoon office to retrieve the documents, which were previously the responsibility of Ji to keep. Now that Ji has not filed a lawsuit, the case will naturally be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Estate Dispute Intensifying</p>
<p>The Hardoon &amp; Co. office was protected by police officers sent by the police station yesterday, and the police officers stationed on the Hardoon property have been increased. Recently, ten people claiming to be relatives of Hardoon have demanded to inherit Hardoon's estate of 43.7 million yuan. This case has intensified due to the death of Mrs. Luo Jialing. Mr. Okamoto, the lawyer handling the case, previously stated that Luo Jialing did not respond to his letters, and only found out the reason on Friday. According to Mr. Okamoto, he and the assistant lawyer Hicks sent a letter yesterday to inquire about the client's future steps in the case.</p>
<p>Luo's Body Embalmed Yesterday</p>
<p>It is also learned that Luo Jialing's body was embalmed yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Aili Garden following Buddhist rituals. Yesterday, those who came to pay their respects, from morning to night, were endless. Organizations included the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, the Shanghai Orphanage Band, and the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association. The authorities also sent seven Chinese and Western Indian police officers to provide close protection. It is heard that the funeral will be held this Wednesday, and the burial will be next to Hardoon's tomb in the garden. According to a reporter from Dazhong News Agency, the Leshan Tongren Society, which Mrs. Luo presided over during her lifetime, will continue to operate. It is also heard that the adopted children will continue Mrs. Luo's wishes and establish a university in the garden to cultivate talents. According to reports, Mrs. Luo once founded Huayan University, which was later renamed Cangsheng Mingzhi University, but was later closed for some reason.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of labor unrest among parts workers in the local printing industry, the number of incidents of striking workers harassing various printing houses has been increasing day by day. Although some workers have been arrested by the police on the spot, the labor side's harassment has not been curbed. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lu Fuchang, a worker from the Xinsheng Printing House on Datong Road, was arrested while distributing leaflets in front of the Chengye Printing House. It is also learned that more than ten companies, including Chunhua Printing House in Gaoshou Lane on Shanxi Road, Lichang on Qipu Road, and Yongfa on Haining Road, have had striking workers go to persuade them to stop working, resulting in serious conflicts. Several workers were also arrested at that time. In addition, the Shenjiang Printing House on Fuxing Road and several other companies have also had conflicts when striking workers went to persuade them to stop working, resulting in heavy losses.</p>

<p>Ms. Liu Wang, a 54-year-old woman from Ningbo, had her mooncake snatched by a beggar in front of 343 Fade Road on the night of the 1st of this month. Ms. Wang went to chase after him and was hit and killed by Tram No. 10 of the French Concession. Details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the police authorities have investigated and found that the tram driver was not at serious fault at the time of the accident, and the blame lies with the deceased herself. However, the family of the deceased is poor, so they have temporarily borrowed money for the funeral and plan to go to the police station today to request negotiations with the tram company, demanding considerable compensation and a consolation payment to repay the funeral debt.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Woman Going to Hospital by Rickshaw; Fetus Falls Out on the Way</h3>
<p>Ms. Liu Li, a 23-year-old Cantonese woman living at 19 Kangti Road, whose husband works as a professional on a foreign ship, was left alone in Shanghai. Recently, due to being full-term in her pregnancy, she was unable to afford a doctor for delivery due to poverty. Therefore, at 7:00 AM on the 4th, she was accompanied by Chen Li, who lived with her, to take a rickshaw to the Zhongde Hospital to await delivery. Due to the bumpiness of the road, the fetus was shaken out in front of 216 Malang Road, and the pregnant woman also fainted in the rickshaw. A policeman saw it, reported it to the police station, and sent a detective to investigate. The pregnant woman Liu Li was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but the male infant who fell out had already died. The infant's body was sent to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Fire Suddenly Broke Out at a Japanese Warehouse in Hongkou Yesterday Morning; Heavy Losses and Spread to Neighboring Houses; Extinguished by Firefighters After Four Hours</h3>
<p>At about 4:18 AM yesterday morning, a large fire suddenly broke out at a Japanese warehouse at 97 Haining Road. At that time, the fire was extremely fierce. After receiving the news, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade immediately dispatched many fire trucks to the rescue, but because the warehouse contained mostly mats and rice used by the Japanese, as well as other flammable Japanese daily necessities, it was impossible to put out the fire for a while. The flames shot up into the sky and became uncontrollable. As a result, it also spread to the neighboring lumber warehouse and the Jinggong Box Factory, and these lumber and cardboard boxes were also easily flammable materials, so it was not extinguished by firefighters until about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, lasting a total of three and a half hours. The total loss this time was quite large, and it is learned that when fighting the fire, a Russian firefighter, Snail Weiqu, fell and injured his back and right hand due to his brave rescue efforts.

<h3>News about Zou Mengchan's Calligraphy and Seal Carving</h3>
<p>Zou Mengchan, a famous calligrapher and seal carver, has been immersed in the study of epigraphy and philology for over thirty years. He has a deep understanding of the classics, histories, and philosophical works, and has completed a collection of annotations on Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals. In the past, Zhonghua Book Company admired his name and hired him to compile the Cihai dictionary, where he made many definitive judgments on old words. His calligraphy is excellent in all styles from great and small seal script to clerical script, and is both ancient and simple, far beyond what modern people can imitate. His seal carving follows the style of Qin Ying, and is free from the vulgarity of modern times, carving gold and cutting jade, directly entering the room of the ancients.

<h3>Waste Production (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Fu Gui</p>
<p>Special Visit to the Handicraft Relief Society</p>
<p>Obligatory School and Paradise for Refugee Children</p>
<p>The society also pays attention to the education of refugee workers' children, using the original school buildings of the boys' and girls' sections of the Qingxin Middle School at Dananmen to establish an obligatory primary school and a kindergarten. There are 450 students in the primary school and 50 in the kindergarten. Most of the students are children of refugee workers, and street children are also admitted as much as possible. At the same time, adult literacy classes are attached, divided into morning and evening classes, so that illiterate refugee workers and nearby poor illiterate people have the opportunity to study. The above-mentioned schools are completely free, and lunch is provided. In addition, all stationery and books have a special feature worth mentioning, that is, all the things used by the teachers and students of the school are donated waste. Broken pens and waste paper are all reused, but the results are not inferior because of this. The reporter once visited the teachers' lounge and saw student essays and art papers displayed in glass cabinets. The front is words and paintings, and the back is clearly used bills, which are mass-donated by a Western restaurant in Puyi bags. Most of the teachers in the school are also from refugee worker families, so they are more diligent in serving their alma mater and regard it as the work they are most willing to undertake.</p>
<p>Children's Canteen About to Run Out of Food</p>
<p>The free canteen set up in the school provides lunch for hundreds of children every day. In the past, it relied entirely on rice and wheat donated by the American Red Cross, and at the same time used the remainder to relieve the nearby elderly, weak, and refugees. The dishes are supplied by the society's affiliated refugee worker farm. Since the reduction in the number of American ships coming from Shanghai, the American Red Cross rice and wheat have been declared to no longer be shipped from next month, which is a fatal blow. It is said that after the implementation of the frozen funds, the economic assistance from the American church is also becoming increasingly difficult. Under the dual crisis, poor children are about to run out of food and cannot get a free lunch after studying in peace. This is such a serious fact that it needs material help and salvation from people in the society!</p>
<p>(Note) Puyi Handicraft Society has an office on the second floor of 115 Hankou Road in the Public Concession.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Life and Death (Roundtable Discussion)</h3>
<p>Date of Roundtable Discussion: October 2, 1941, starting at 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Location of Roundtable Discussion: Inside the Internal and External Political and Economic Translation Agency</p>
<p>A war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. Negotiations before the gunfire are just a preparation that should be made to delay the time before the slaughter, right? If Japan and the United States go to war, is Shanghai finished? If there is no war, can Shanghai continue to maintain this situation for a long time? Many people believe that the key to determining Shanghai's future lies in the local politics; but in fact, the transportation problem is even more important. This is the unanimous opinion of the three of us in this roundtable discussion; this article is the conclusion of this roundtable discussion. Is it true or is it false? We question the experts. We believe that this is not a matter of intelligence seeing intelligence, and benevolence seeing benevolence, which can be perfunctorily passed off; it is a matter of life and death for Shanghai and the people of Shanghai. Looking forward to the future, it seems that there are not many days left; how can we then be able to do it?</p>
<h3>Is Politics More Important than Transportation? Or is Transportation More Important than Politics?</h3>
<p>Where does the key to Shanghai's future lie? If we leave aside the political issue, then it should be the cargo transportation problem. In fact, even from a political point of view: whether or not foreign transportation can be maintained? The relationship is also very important. Because if British and American ships continue to come to Shanghai, then the relationship between Britain and the United States and Shanghai can also be strengthened. Of course: if British and American ships stop coming to Shanghai, it does not mean that Britain and the United States have abandoned Shanghai or withdrawn from Shanghai. But under this situation, that is, when Shanghai's foreign transportation becomes a problem, Shanghai's political situation may not be the same as it is now, right? This is to say: Shanghai's foreign transportation problem can also determine Shanghai's political situation. However, Shanghai's political situation will not determine Shanghai's foreign transportation problem. The key to determining Shanghai's foreign transportation problem is not in Shanghai's political situation, but in the world's political situation. If the international political situation does not change, then no matter what pressure Shanghai's political situation is under, Britain and the United States will never stop their ships from coming to Shanghai, and may even have the opposite effect. Because Shanghai is the last fortress of Britain and the United States in the Far East, they will never change their fixed policy due to any situation that occurs locally. Therefore, we can say that the key to Shanghai's future lies in the problem of Shanghai's foreign cargo transportation, and Shanghai's local political situation is not as important as the average person imagines. It doesn't seem to be arbitrary, right?</p>
<p>What Happens When Shanghai's Transportation is Cut Off</p>
<p>Why is the cargo transportation problem so decisive for Shanghai's future? The reason is very simple: especially in the economic aspect. Let me explain:</p>
<p>(1) Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, it is still acting as a part of the national territory's collection and distribution center. The products of the occupied areas are swallowed and exhaled here; even the supply and demand of materials in the rear areas are partially swallowed and exhaled here. Even those inside and outside Japan rely on the transfer in and out of the port of Shanghai, and the number is even greater. However, the condition for completing this collection and distribution task is cargo transportation. Once foreign transportation stagnates, Shanghai's economic position will completely change, which is obvious.</p>
<p>(2) Although Shanghai is the largest commercial port in the Far East, it is also a major industrial city. China's export native products are processed and manufactured in Shanghai. Imported raw materials are refined in Shanghai. The country's largest national textile industry and flour industry, as well as all light industries and simple machinery and tool manufacturing industries, are concentrated in Shanghai. However, whether it is native raw materials or imported raw materials, if the supply to Shanghai is stopped once, Shanghai's entire industrial structure will completely collapse. And the supply of these raw materials to Shanghai takes cargo transportation as its prerequisite.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai's prosperity in recent years is not based on the wartime boom, but on the evil consequences of the war. The wartime boom is based on the need for materials for the war; and Shanghai's prosperity completely relies on the concentration of population and floating capital. Because of the concentration of population, the needs of daily necessities and the commercial relations are thriving. Because of the concentration of floating capital, speculative business is flourishing. If overseas transportation is stopped, and the supply of daily necessities is suspended, the concentrated population will inevitably disperse; and the floating capital will also disperse, and investment business will also decline. And the decline of speculative business can also accelerate the dispersion of the population. The current market in Shanghai can be said to be completely supported by speculative business.</p>
<p>There Are Three Ridiculous Thoughts</p>
<p>Now there is a group of so-called people who indulge in fantasy. They believe that if Shanghai falls into a completely occupied situation due to the opening of the Pacific War, Shanghai's existing economic structure will not stop. One reason is that Japanese ships replace British and American merchant ships in entering and exiting, and the second reason is that Japan has an absolute need for Shanghai's production equipment. There is another batch of delusions, thinking that in order to continue to obtain overseas material supplies, Japan may let Shanghai be in a neutral position. At that time, Shanghai's situation will certainly become another kind of appearance, but it is not the scene of the destruction of Great Shanghai. Putting aside this slave mentality, just linking it with the decisive nature of transportation to Shanghai's future, that is to say: the decisive factor for Shanghai's future is not the transportation problem, but the political problem.</p>
<h3>Dead Port, Deserted Island, Abandoned Wharf - The Destruction of Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>Even If There Are Ships, There Will Be No Goods to Transport</p>
<p>We do not deny that the political issues are more decisive for Shanghai than the transportation issues. But no matter what, Shanghai's local political issues will not change Shanghai's foreign transportation situation: unless the entire international situation changes, it will affect Shanghai's foreign transportation. If Shanghai's foreign transportation conditions change, then Shanghai's situation may become the kind of appearance that those fantasists are fantasizing about. But unfortunately, once there is a problem with foreign transportation, those fantasized situations will not save the destruction of Great Shanghai. The destruction of Great Shanghai by artillery fire may not appear in the future Pacific War, but it is very possible that Great Shanghai will be suffocated to death due to the stagnation of transportation. The matter is very clear: since Britain and the United States are at war with Japan, then the materials of Britain and the United States and their territories will naturally no longer be supplied to areas under Japanese control, and Shanghai will not be an exception. At that time, even if the Japanese merchant fleet still has the spare capacity to transport goods, I am afraid that there will be no goods to transport, right? Besides, does it have this kind of spare capacity? It is still a big question.</p>
<p>The Factory Chimneys Will Have No Smoke to Emit</p>
<p>The British and the United States, and their territories, including the islands of Southeast Asia, completely stopped the material trade with the Japanese sphere of influence due to the Pacific War. Even if Japan plans to use Shanghai's production equipment, it will fall into a situation where there is no rice to cook. Machines that are not afraid of anything are only afraid of not having raw materials. If they only rely on the raw materials in the occupied areas to maintain them, may I ask what raw materials can the occupied areas supply for the existing industrial equipment in Shanghai? Rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, raw silk, and very little coal and iron sand can indeed be obtained from the occupied areas of China. However, these are not the targets that Japan wants to use Shanghai's industrial equipment for. Moreover, once the Pacific War starts, the Chinese troops in various places will inevitably rise up to counterattack, and the supply of materials from the occupied areas to Shanghai will be greatly reduced. Therefore, even if the factory chimneys rising on the roofs of Shanghai are not destroyed by Japan and are prepared to be used, they will not emit black smoke like they do now; isn't it imaginable.</p>
<p>The Japanese's Calculations Like This</p>
<p>Thinking for Japan, when the Pacific War breaks out and enters an inevitable raw material famine, the nature of Shanghai's existing collection and distribution center should be cherished and cared for. At that time, continuing to let Shanghai's international neutral status continue, making Shanghai a transit station for Japan to obtain material supplies from the democratic front countries, is definitely in Japan's absolute interest. Perhaps there are more Japanese people who have this fantasy than other kinds of people, right? But unfortunately, this is just the Japanese's wishful thinking. May I ask what good is it for the democratic front to retain Shanghai as this gateway? In other words: why does the democratic front still want to retain Shanghai as this port? Why should they continue to supply materials to Shanghai to help the enemy?</p>
<p>According to the Japanese fantasists, like the fantasies published by the reporter of Shanghai Daily News when the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds: they believed that although the European War today has completely cut off the economic relations between the Axis countries and the democratic countries, the materials that both sides must exchange can still be traded in the market of Switzerland, a neutral country. Retaining Switzerland's neutrality is beneficial to both the Axis and democratic countries. And they believe that the situation is the same for retaining Shanghai's neutrality. Therefore, in the Far East War, Shanghai may become like Switzerland.</p>
<p>This kind of fantasy of the Japanese will greatly excite those people who are worried about Shanghai's future and at the same time are obsessed with Shanghai. However, fantasy is still fantasy, and Shanghai and Switzerland have their absolutely different destinies. It is impossible for Shanghai to maintain its neutral position in the complex Balkan Peninsula on an equal footing with Switzerland just because Shanghai has complex international relations.</p>
<h3>Political Economy and Status: Shanghai is Not Comparable to Switzerland</h3>
<p>Firstly, Shanghai does not have the qualification of independence. It is a part of Chinese territory, transformed into its current state as an international city through various diplomatic treaties, fundamentally different from the Free City of Danzig. It is even more absolutely different from Switzerland, which possesses the qualifications of an independent country. Because Switzerland has the status of an independent nation, its neutrality arises from its position as a third party. In the struggle between the Axis and the Democratic sides, as long as it does not lean towards either side, neither can violate its neutrality. At the same time, both should respect its neutrality and thus utilize it. Shanghai is different. The occupied part is under the control of Japanese forces. The so-called complex relationships in the concessions are, in reality, still nothing more than the intertwining of the Democratic line and the Axis front. Therefore, merely in the current Sino-Japanese War, it is already extremely difficult to make the concessions adhere to neutrality. When the concession's big bosses, Britain and America, become enemies with Japan, there will be absolutely no possibility of neutrality in Shanghai. Of course, dreamers are accustomed to daydreaming, even speculating that in a future war, Britain and America will hand over the Shanghai concessions to a third party for trusteeship, and predicting who this third party will be, asserting that this third party must be someone who is favored by Japan and allowed to live freely outside the concentration camp. However, by that time, the so-called third party, if not a product born from the testicles of Japan, there will be no third party. Therefore, in the arena of a Far Eastern war, there is absolutely no possibility of a true third party appearing in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Secondly, both Britain and Germany retain and fully utilize the neutral market of Switzerland, not only because Switzerland genuinely possesses the qualifications and sovereignty of a third party but also because there is indeed value in utilizing this neutral market. Because the surplus products of Germany's heavy industry can be welcomed by the Democratic front, and the industrial products and raw materials of the Democratic countries are also highly sought after by Germany's military industry. Both sides have value in utilizing this neutral market, and this neutral market can then develop and prosper accordingly and stand firm. But in the future Far Eastern war arena, what do Britain and America seek from Japan? And what can Japan export and supply to Britain and America? Artificial silk, silk fabrics, toys, and canned fish are Japan's top products, but none of them are welcomed by the military economies of Britain and America. What do Britain and America seek? The supplies from Britain and America and their territories to Japan: oil, steel, machinery, hardware raw materials, etc., Japan would indeed welcome them with open arms, but would Britain and America be willing to continue supplying them? In short, Britain and Germany retain and utilize the Swiss neutral market because there is a need for its retention and a value for its utilization. As for Shanghai, if it were to be turned into a neutral market, Japan certainly has a need to protect it and a value in utilizing it, but Britain and America have absolutely no such need and no value in utilizing it. At most, in order to reduce the property losses of their expatriates in Shanghai, refraining from resisting on the spot would be the greatest favor they could grant to the future of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in terms of geographical situation: Although Switzerland hangs high above the Alpine peaks of the Balkan Peninsula, surrounded by the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to the north and south, it borders France to the east. Thus, the inflow of surplus products from the Axis countries into Switzerland's neutral market is extremely easy. Even the surplus products of democratic countries such as Britain and America can reach the Swiss market via the free zone of the French market. But what is the position of Shanghai? It can be said to be hidden in the hinterland of the Japanese naval defense line. Does Japan have the courage to open its naval defense line to allow ships from so-called neutral countries to pass through and sail to Shanghai? Even if it happens occasionally, it is foreseeable that it cannot reverse the misfortune of Shanghai as a dead port.</p>
<p>In conclusion: Maintaining Shanghai is only beneficial to Japan. For the war economies of Britain, America, and even China, it can be said that there is no benefit to speak of. Therefore, when the international political situation changes drastically, even if Japan does not exert political pressure on Shanghai, Shanghai will become a dead port. That is to say: even if the political situation in Shanghai does not change at that time, there can be no hope for the continuation of overseas traffic. And when the international political situation maintains the status quo and does not deteriorate, the fate of Shanghai's future depends even more on the smoothness of transportation conditions. According to the current situation: Shanghai's overseas traffic is getting worse day by day, not only is the number of ships decreasing, but also the freight rates are soaring. This is both increasing the pressure on Shanghai's commodity price market and also increasing the internal disruption of the Shanghai market. And the trend of decreasing ships and soaring freight rates is still in full swing. Why don't Shanghai's industrial capital with foresight take precautions in advance?</p>
<h3>The Worse the Traffic Environment, the Greater the Danger of Hoarding</h3>
<p>It Seems Heroes Think Alike</p>
<p>In recent years, although the people of Shanghai have experienced many false alarms, their courage has grown a lot. A school of optimism: including Japan and the United States will not go to war, and Shanghai after the war will not be idle..., at first it was just a self-comforting statement in helplessness, and now it seems to have become a belief for them. They know that the number of ships is decreasing day by day; they also know that the supply of goods is decreasing day by day. However, they have another calculation: less imports, less exports; there is no problem with money. So making money is the first priority. If you can't rely on money, it's best to have real goods. With goods, you can be unscrupulous. The more panicked others are, the more successful they will be. After all, they are skeptical about the war between Japan and the United States. It is better to hoard alive than to hoard dead, which can not only avoid shelving funds but also earn more money from more decisions. An children's access is, after all, limited in strength: Why not use the floating funds in the market to expand their own plans? So they formed a logic: it is better to speculate than to hoard goods, it is better to open a bank than to speculate, and expand. Opening a bank can not only absorb deposits but also engage in various scales of speculation; once the wind blows, it can hoard goods on a large scale to drive up prices. Moreover, the banking industry is different from others, it doesn't matter whether the traffic is cut off or not. Recently, new banks have sprung up, which can be said to be the same thing that heroes see.</p>
<p>Opening a Bank is also Full of Crises</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the emergence of these new banks will only increase the danger of their funds and push the Shanghai market to a greater danger. The reason is very simple. Just talk about the danger of their funds.</p>
<p>(1) The banking industry is fundamentally a credit business. In wartime when people's minds are floating, you will encounter bad luck at any time. The reason why Shanghai's financial industry was able to cope with the "August 13" war was entirely due to stable financial measures. In recent years, the reason why the financial industry has been able to continue to enjoy prosperity is entirely due to the fact that the war is not in Shanghai and the speculation business has achieved smooth development. And the continued maintenance of foreign traffic is the biggest reason why Shanghai can form the current situation. In the changeable future, the situation may be completely reversed.</p>
<p>(2) Bankers and ordinary depositors have the mentality that it is better to hoard money than to hoard goods. Therefore, in the situation where the traffic conditions change blatantly, depositors will inevitably withdraw deposits to hoard goods, and the financial industry will have to sell the hoards to cope with the withdrawals. Not to mention the chaotic situation in the market, the bank itself will be greatly unlucky first, which should be beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The Interests of Traffic and Hoarders</p>
<p>(3) The current development of the international situation only makes it possible for Shanghai's foreign traffic to deteriorate more and more, and there is no hope for Shanghai's foreign traffic to turn danger into safety. It can be imagined that after the German-Soviet war is frozen with the freezing of the weather, the naval battle between Germany and Britain will intensify. And the rapid advance of the US's in-kind assistance to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the demand for ships will inevitably also be strengthened. As a result, Shanghai's foreign traffic situation will also worsen.</p>
<p>The worse the foreign traffic situation in Shanghai, the more the value of Shanghai's utilization for Japan will decline. This cause and effect is exactly the same as the relationship between the legal tender and Japan. The greater the effectiveness of the foreign exchange control of the legal tender, the smaller the possibility for Japan to buy foreign exchange. The smaller the possibility for Japan to buy foreign exchange of the legal tender, the smaller the value of the legal tender for Japan. As a result, Japan's attempts to destroy the legal tender may reignite. Although the foreign exchange control of the legal tender has been strengthened now, Japan can still buy some of it. This state of better than nothing has stabilized his current depressed mood.</p>
<p>Japan hopes that the Shanghai market exists because it wants to use the port of Shanghai to obtain the British and American goods that it is not easy to obtain in its own country. The worse the foreign traffic conditions in Shanghai, the smaller the value of Shanghai for his utilization will naturally be. So in the period when he is extremely feeling the material panic, how can he let go of the large number of hoards in the concession area? Japan is still requisitioning the goods of his own people, so how can he relax the people of Shanghai?</p>
<p>The term "Japan confiscates the hoards in Shanghai warehouses" is definitely not a word to scare children. The reason why it is not being carried out now is that the political problem is a point, and the fact that Shanghai still has utilization value is also a point; the reason why Shanghai still has utilization value for Japan is that the foreign traffic entering Shanghai has not been completely cut off; although the number of ships is decreasing day by day, it is better than nothing after all. Afterwards, the tighter the international situation, the more urgent Japan's preparations for war will be, on the one hand, making Japan's material panic heavier, and on the other hand, making Japan's utilization value of the port of Shanghai smaller. In this helpless sacrifice, there is naturally only one way to kill the chicken to get the eggs. Killing the hen to get the eggs when the hen is not sick is indeed what a fool does. The situation is different when the hen is sick. Therefore, the worse the foreign traffic in Shanghai, the worse the prices will follow, and the interests of hoarders seem to be getting bigger and bigger; but their danger is also getting more and more severe.</p>

<h3>What kind of work can an educated housewife do?</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Many people have asked the same question: "What kind of work can a housewife do?" That is indeed a question. Under such a question, they spend their days playing cards and strolling around, numbing their minds.</p>
<p>In fact, an educated housewife has many things to do in her spare time from housework, especially in terms of culture because men may not have enough time to implement them in order to maintain the family's income.</p>
<p>If you have a little spare time, then you can engage in research, engage in writing, engage in collecting, engage in compiling. Many valuable books can also be produced from this. Because great work requires constant effort, even if there is only one hour of spare time every day, there can be great achievements in one or two years.</p>
<p>Secondly, why don't those who love music try composing? Why don't those who love interior decoration read more books? Why don't those who love painting create a new style? These things are all suitable for women's personalities. Wouldn't life be more meaningful if they could choose one and continue to work hard?</p>
<h3>Mrs. Tolstoy's Complaints</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Anyone who has a considerable love for literature knows Tolstoy, this great figure. He was born in 1828 and died in 1910. He wrote many books in his life, especially "War and Peace," which made him leap onto the literary scene and occupy a lofty position.</p>
<p>However, he could not enjoy his family life. His wife once made the following complaints: "He really has no genuine enthusiasm because enthusiasm is just his doctrine and does not come from his heart. In his biography, you can certainly see him helping workers fetch water, but at home, he never gives me any time to rest (this has been the case throughout the 32 years of marriage). He has never given his children a drop of water, nor has he ever sat by my bed for five minutes to give me some comfort."</p>
<p>Although we cannot know the actual situation, from the surface, Tolstoy's marital relationship must not have been very harmonious. And his wife's complaints have some prejudices. A husband who has devoted his life to literature and occasionally neglects the family is not a crime. A person who is engaged in writing must concentrate all his energy on his work and allow no negligence in order to have great achievements; if he focuses on family life, then he will never have great works produced. For the sake of the wife's own comfort, there is a modern saying: "Don't marry a writer." However, for the sake of society and the country, and putting oneself last, then how honorable it is to have a husband like Tolstoy! (By honor here, I mean the honor of the country, the honor of society, and the honor of culture. Only last is one's own honor.) Therefore, if a wife can understand her husband's greatness and enable him to make a considerable contribution to society, the spiritual comfort she gets will be ten times greater than the physical pleasure she does not get.</p>
<p>As an aside, Tolstoy suddenly left his family in 1910 and hid in a small house in Astapovo, where he soon died of heart disease.</p>
<p>&gt;My Family Problems</p>
<p>[P "My Family Problems" Essay Contest Results Announced: Children in the Hands of Stepmothers</p>
<p>— Yu Zhong</p>
<p>This essay contest received a lot of submissions, which shows the readers' enthusiasm for the magazine. Starting with this issue, we will publish them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Whenever home is mentioned, people always think of the adjectives "warm" and "happy". However, my home is as cold as ice and has nothing worth cherishing.</p>
<p>My dad married a stepmother, and because of his job, he only came home twice a month, so I became a chick in her hands, subject to her disposal and torment.</p>
<p>Every morning at five-thirty, I get up, light the coal stove, serve my younger siblings (born to my stepmother) to school, empty the chamber pots, tidy up the rooms, and then go to school myself. When I come back at noon, I have to cook and wash clothes. Fortunately, classes at school don't start until three in the afternoon every day, so I can barely cope. After evening classes, I come back to cook dinner, make shoes for my younger siblings, mend socks, and spend the whole day busy with these household chores. My mom gets up very late and sits outside playing cards every day, so all the chores fall on my shoulders.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, it's time for me to prepare my homework, but my sister says she can't sleep with the lights on, so my mom habitually makes a fuss: "What are girls studying for? Knowing a few words is enough. Holding books all day long, you really want to be a female champion. I can't control other people, but I don't have the role of a mother." She turned to her sister and said, "Dead ghost! You have to sleep even if you can't sleep! You don't even open your eyes when you talk. They have a lot of money, so they keep the expensive lights on." Heavens! How can I study in such an environment? But my mom had said long ago: "If you spend money, you should get good grades. If you don't get in the top three, you won't be allowed to continue next semester!"</p>
<p>When my dad comes home, my mom starts complaining in front of everyone: "She can't do anything, reading and writing all day long. Only I, her old nanny, suffer. Alas! It's really hard to be a stepmother! No matter how good I am to her, she doesn't know." If I'm doing housework at this time, she'll add this sentence: "What are you doing for show? Go read your books!" She'll immediately snatch the work from my hands and push me aside. In addition, she prevents me from meeting my dad alone. In fact, even when I'm alone with my dad, I don't have much to say. My dad is old, and I don't want to hurt his feelings. After she found out about this, she treated me even more wickedly.</p>
<p>My home is like this. As I write this, my mom came back after losing money and started grumbling, pointing fingers and scolding...</p>
<p>I dare say that Ms. Yu Zhong's situation is very common in Chinese families. We don't object to men remarrying, but men who remarry must not forget their children's future for their own happiness. Therefore, fathers of children who have suffered in the hands of stepmothers should bear considerable responsibility because the children of stepmothers are definitely not brought along at the time of marriage. At least at the time of the initial marriage, fathers can do some work to avoid discrimination by stepmothers against children born to their former wives, and at the same time, they can make the children born to their former wives not have another concept of stepmothers, thinking that stepmothers will always abuse the children of their former wives.</p>
<p>Naturally, since the initiator of this tragedy is the stepmother, educated stepmothers should not have any discriminatory or abusive actions. In such a great era, children are no longer the private property of their parents; they belong to the country. So why destroy the peaceful atmosphere in the family for the sake of some relationship with the children you have given birth to?</p>
<p>In any case, this is a problem worth discussing. I hope readers will contribute more concrete opinions. A few words are just to elicit valuable opinions. Editor</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>One Shift System</h3>
<p>— Wei San</p>
<p>In recent days, foreign businesses in Shanghai have been studying the so-called one-shift system, and twelve American companies have already announced its implementation. The purpose is to save on coal consumption because the days are getting shorter, and winter is approaching. The amount of coal needed for electric lights and radiators in the afternoon is truly astonishing. In this era of coal being as precious as gold, this measure seems necessary on the surface.</p>
<p>According to the American companies' plan, the morning and afternoon shifts are combined into one, starting work at 8:00 AM and ending at 1:00 PM without a break. After 1:00 PM, employees are free to go home. We believe this new proposal deserves study from both practical and advantageous/disadvantageous perspectives. Of course, we are not criticizing the gains or losses of foreign companies reforming their office hours, but merely offering an objective opinion.</p>
<p>We believe that any system should not be easily abolished unless absolutely necessary, before there is a guarantee of good results from the new method. Because sometimes implementing a new system may not bring benefits but rather cause problems. If we then revert to the old system, why bother with the change in the first place? Currently, the entire Shanghai society practices a two-shift system, which has become a traditional habit. Once changed to a single shift, everyone will feel inconvenienced. Commercial operations involve frequent contact with various parties. If Company A implements a one-shift system, and Company B has a major transaction in the afternoon that requires contact with Company A, it will have to wait until the next day. The resulting loss is self-evident. Besides this city, delays of half a day in the exchange of telegrams and messages with other cities and internationally also matter. We should not only consider our own convenience but also consider others, which is what is called benefiting oneself and others. If we only seek to benefit ourselves, it is untenable in principle.</p>
<p>As for the amount of coal saved, it is currently impossible to judge without precise statistics. In short, we believe that increasing revenue is one thing, and reducing expenses is another. If business is booming and things are busy, the office should be brightly lit, and people should still be working even until dusk. Of course, we shouldn't be concerned about the cost of coal. If employees working one shift can save on one trip's transportation cost, they might go to the movies or dancing during the long period from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM after returning home, spending many times more than the cost of one trip.</p>
<p>The Chinese are truly worthy of pride. Our spirit of starting early and working late, enduring hardship and being hard-working, has been passed down from our ancestors to the present. Although cities need electricity and consume coal, villages may not need coal at all, and ordinary stores in Shanghai have never had radiators. I think this winter, we should all wear more clothes and not use stoves. As for unnecessary electric lights, we can reduce their use as much as possible. Saving on coal consumption through perseverance and hard work, we do not need to imitate the one-shift system. We should intensify our work, increase production, and maintain the long shift system from morning to night.</p>
<h3>Elder Lengchan's Humorous Words on Taking a Second Wife</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Elder Lengchan will take a second wife sometime after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Wood Taoist once presented him with a couplet, containing the line "leaping over the eastern neighbor's wall to embrace her maiden." His friend, Layman Chuwan, considered the word "embrace" (摟) to be a lively and expressive choice. He then used the word "embrace" as the first word of six *Sixteen-Character Song* poems to congratulate him. These poems are jocular without being rude, and contain gentle admonitions, making them quite amusing.</p>
<p>Sixteen-Character Song, Six Songs, with Preface</p>
<p>A half-taoist, cultivating to half-immortality; Layman Chan's Nest, participating in the joy of meditation (Both "Half-Taoist Wood" and "Layman Chan's Nest" are sobriquets given to Wood Taoist by Lengchan). Occupying the sprouting of a withered willow, surely many auspicious dreams. Stroking the old tree of flowers, how can there be ugly branches? Daring to offer admonitions, I've included jests. The lyrics of a small poem are equivalent to the true transmission of sixteen characters. Under the bright moon of mid-autumn, I sing of a hundred years of blissful union.</p>
<p>Embrace! Has the old man's amorousness not diminished? Pay attention to your chamber; do not lightly indulge your *qi*.</p>
<p>Embrace! Warming and re-warming, the tenderness is more tender. Has your soul dissipated? Truly, you must rest.</p>
<p>Embrace! Carved cheeks and combed whiskers, an unusual refinement. Who can count how many you do not allow to remain?</p>
<p>Embrace! Tonight, try a throw into your bosom. Share the same bed in dreams; how could you allow the gap of a great divide?</p>
<p>Embrace! Your room has two fish, good for staring. They pursue each other, their red brilliance reflecting in the porcelain cup.</p>
<p>Embrace! Beware of a master peering from above. Do not release so freely; the old tree cannot bear the autumn.</p>
<p>"Note": The old man's room has two goldfish, hence the name "Double Fish Hermitage." Every move of the old man is known to Master Wood, hence the sixth song.</p>

<h3>Busy with Gift-Giving Before the Festival</h3>
<p>— Fang Yang</p>
<p>"Ah Er, go to Shao Wansheng to bring back a Jiang ham, one that costs over forty dollars. Then go to Guanshengyuan to get two boxes of mooncakes. Go to Sincere or Wing On to get four bottles of Changyu wine, and buy a basket of fruit by the way." Pack a ready-made flower basket, and count a few foreign dollars! Landlord Li was spiritedly instructing his rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>"Remember everything? Here's one hundred and fifty dollars; you count it!" The landlord entrusted him with great trust.</p>
<p>In fact, Ah Er was honest. He had worked for the Li family for nearly fourteen years, and since I moved in, I had often heard the landlord praising his virtues. Therefore, Ah Er served his master diligently like an ox. Although he occasionally grumbled, he always thought that the master was the master, and we servants had no choice but to do as we were told.</p>
<p>Today, he was very happy, partly because his master trusted him and, most importantly, because there would be "commission money" to "earn"!</p>
<p>I watched him go out excitedly. He was very thrifty for his master and didn't take the tram. He often told me!</p>
<p>"Mr. Fang, think about it. A rickshaw puller's legs are meant for running. Now that I'm not pulling a rickshaw, my body is free. Should I still take the tram?"</p>
<p>After about two hours, Ah Er brought back four items, his hands marked with red welts from the ropes.</p>
<p>The master inspected the items and settled the accounts. The four invoices totaled one hundred and one dollars and forty cents.</p>
<p>"You didn't buy badly!" Mr. Li praised him.</p>
<p>"Now, immediately deliver these to No. ×× Malan Road, to the residence of the bank manager. Be careful when you go in!" Mr. Li instructed, smoking a cigar on the side.</p>
<p>Ah Er replied with several "Yes, yes, yes!" and carefully left without looking back.</p>
<p>After a while, Ah Er returned, very happy, saying that he had received twelve dollars in "tips," giving two dollars to the maid and keeping ten for himself!</p>
<p>For the past few days, all I've heard is the landlord busy sending gifts out and receiving gifts in. The expenses for this sum of money must be within five hundred dollars. However, I don't understand why so many social affairs require so much money. When will this custom disappear? However, in this society where "a thousand wrongs are acceptable, but not wronging a sycophant," what can be done? I cannot answer.</p>
<p>In the evening, the landlord's wife was grumbling again, "The lights are being used too much; everyone, save some!" Immediately after, she closed the door and went upstairs. The sound of mahjong tiles echoed, and it would probably be dawn again under a hundred electric lights!</p>
<h3>Beriberi</h3>
<p>— Zang Huan Chun</p>
<p>Patient: "Doctor! I feel very uncomfortable in my feet and it's very inconvenient to walk."</p>
<p>Doctor: "This is the most popular so-called beriberi in Shanghai! It is caused by eating foreign Xian rice, which lacks vitamins."</p>
<p>Patient: "No! Doctor, we eat Changxi Du rice at home every day; and we often take vitamin ABCD."</p>
<p>Doctor: "Then you must not be doing enough exercise with your limbs!"</p>
<p>Patient: "Alas! Doctor, I exercise in the dance hall almost every day!"</p>
<p>Doctor: "Then..."</p>
<h3>A Bundle of Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Lu Jinglang</p>
<p>Mr. Praises Jin</p>
<p>Jiaming: "Mom, Mr. Huang at school praised me today!"</p>
<p>Mom: "What did Mr. Huang say?"</p>
<p>Jiaming: "Mr. Huang said that if Jiaming could get rid of all his bad temper, he would be a good child!"</p>
<h3>A Record of Laughter</h3>
<p>— Deng Shiyi</p>
<p>Female Passenger: Hey! Give me a one dollar and twenty cent ticket.</p>
<p>Ticket Seller: Oh. Why take the streetcar on such a hot day? It would be better to walk.</p>
<p>Male Passenger: How unreasonable! What does it matter to you if she takes the streetcar? Why do you have to nag?</p>
<p>Ticket Seller: (Smiling) Sir, please don't get angry. She is my wife!</p>
<p>Woman A: Today's youth is really getting worse and worse. Look, they are barely old enough, but they know everything.</p>
<p>Woman B: No, I say today's youth is much more well-behaved.</p>
<p>Woman A: How do you see that?</p>
<p>Woman B: Twenty years ago, when I walked on the road, those young men would stare at me. Now when I walk on the road, they don't even look at me. Isn't that much more well-behaved? (Chuckles)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Thirteen: Wandering to Shanghai</p>
<p>"Oh! Elder Brother, what do you know?" Begonia put down his teacup, shaking his head continuously, saying: "You are a bachelor, of course you are not afraid of anything! If you are happy to go to Tianjin today, then go to Tianjin. If you want to go down to Jiangnan tomorrow, then go down to Jiangnan. But we can't do that! Besides, I am now a farmer, and I have nothing to eat except farming. How can I compare to you?"</p>
<p>Yu Kun saw that he was almost frantic, so he jumped down from the table with a thud, showing a more serious expression and said:</p>
<p>"Good brother, what's the rush! I am also someone who has eaten old rice for more than thirty years. No matter how clueless I am, I will never leave you with any more trouble." Saying that, he pointed his hand at the opposite street. "Look, how have the young couple of the Meng family been treating you these days? You can relax! To be honest, when I started this matter, although there were three hooligans from Beihe Town helping me, they didn't know why they were robbing someone, or who they were robbing; once we got to the temple, I gave each of them ten dollars and sent them away. After that, I learned from Zhang Yide, Lord Zhang San, personally untied Lin Sheng, and even apologized to him. Later, I lived in that temple for more than ten days, and I treated him with good meat and wine every day. I also often explained to him your hardships and how Shang Lao Er didn't follow the rules, and even he said that everything was Shang Lao Er's fault. If he still bears a grudge against you in the future, that kid is not human!" (229)</p>
