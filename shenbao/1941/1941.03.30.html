<p>羅馬尼亞京城　「世界報」刋載消息、德駐南公使希倫昨日曾向南國新外長寗齊志有所詢問、南國所提出之答覆似未能使德方滿意、緣軸心國對於模稜兩可之表示、決不能視為滿足故也云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南反軸心情緒高張　德僑奉命自南撤退</h3>

<p>柏林　德國外交部發言人今午宣稱、吾國現正密切注意南國京城之發展、及南國政治領袖仇德力量之生長、德國官方對南國局勢尚未發表評倫、南國因塞爾維亞急進份子勢力高漲、故有反德傾向、德國駐南公使希倫參加彼得二世加冕典禮、在途中遭遇羣衆侮辱、卽為此輩急進份子所激起、希倫昨日曾與南國總理西摩維志及外長會晤、此訊業經證實、就南國之一般局勢而論、似尚未改變其外交基本政策、但局勢迄未廓淸、故仍有關於南國意向傳說不一之消息繼續傳至此間、當南國加入三國公約之時、德國曾表示穩定東南歐局勢之希望、故南國　有某種力量反抗此項目的所將引起之後果、其責任應由彼等負之云、（二十九日海通電）</p>

<p>紐約　美國各報對於南斯拉夫之政變、皆認其為希特勒喪失威嚴、惟關於希氏是否將應用武力或政治手段、以恢復德國在巴爾幹之有利地位、則意見頗不一致、美國各無綫電臺批評家對於蘇聯顯然贊助南國新首機西摩維樞將軍之政變、均有深刻印象、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　南國於本月二十六日夜間發生政變、前政府所有重要官員均遭逮捕、被圈禁於參謀本部大厦內、頃由政府予以開釋、惟前內閣總理施維柯維志與南國京城警察署長殷歇區二人仍未釋放、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹局勢前瞻</h3>
<p>距今恰是一星期，南南斯拉夫當局正在投向納粹的懷抱之深處，德國已忻然準備驗收這一新夥計的最後手續，希臘以外的巴爾幹半島可謂大勢已定了。其時本報評述其事，旣申慨歎，却在那頻於絕望之際，提出了兩句保留：以為德意志對南國欲得安然其為盟主，一須希特勒不作進一小的勒索，二須南國政權並無鉅變。詎知最近三日來，竟然實現了鉅變。</p>
<p>這不是向讀者衒示前論的談言微中。確也不是把握住了鉅變實現的必然性。祇是我們的心靈上伏有一種牢不可破的信念，由此信念，產生感應。這種信念與感應，絺非我們所獨有；但因近年世變似乎到處見得瘋狂至於絕無情理與常軌可言，遂使最平凡的信念受了蒙蔽，遂使一般應有的感應陷於麻木狀態之中。云何信念？即民族自珍自愛的意識，以及獨立自由的要求，在每一開明的民族，是先天的，是天賦的；平時隱藏着，及至危急存亡之秋，其發動後之力量是不可遏止的，其發動後之結果是天公地道而成功的。這在侵略者，根本否認這一信念的可以成立，而希特勒的收獲又幾乎證明了這一信念之空虛；像中國，像希臘，反而被視為近乎例外。我們在理智上以此信念為千古不磨，雖事實上不幸目覩希特勒權威之下的種種反證，信念還是信念；而南國實現這次鉅變以前之民氣張揚，輿情憤激，使我們在目覩近乎狂瀾旣倒之前的一霎那，本能的，直覺的，發生了可能促成鉅變的感應。現在，鉅變竟得實現了！</p>
<p>這一次，南斯拉夫於本月二十五日簽字加入軸心，希特勒正在得意地歡迎他的嘉賓松岡，炫耀他的外交勝利；却不想十七齡半的彼得二世，竟於二十七日淸晨一時，收回政權，實行新政，悄悄派兵士二十名，把負責簽訂盟約的閣員逮捕，完成了所謂「不流血的政變」然後一方頒發詔書，安撫人心，一方任命陸軍領袖西摩維志將軍組成新閣，全國翕然；於是，在短短數小時中，一個形同待決之囚的「軸心附庸」，一躍而成為獨立自主，朝氣蓬勃的有為國族。人們觀乎兩日來南國全國人民歡欣鼓舞，慶祝自由的熱烈狀况，眞像英相邱吉爾說的一樣，感覺到這個國家已在最後一剎那，重新找到了好怕「國魂」。這不是揶揄吧，使柏林方面興高采烈的軸心官員們，以及行裝甫卸，備受慇懃招待的盟國上賓，感覺到本來已在口邊的羔羊，現已變為不可控制的猛虎雄獅；本來可以誇張勝利，現在却不得不承認失敗。軸心陣綫在外交方面遭了如此嚴重打擊，其意義與影響，可與義大利在阿比西尼亞和伊里特利亞方面的軍事挫敗，等量齊觀，或尤過之。</p>
<p>此一鉅變，成功雖然奇速，形跡似是突兀，但察其過程踨跡，却非常自然。遠在資維哥維區內閣不顧民意的反對，不聽英美乃至蘇聯的勸告，一意孤行，決定入盟的時候，三位閣員拂袖而去，若干城市居民未威反對，這皆顯明的朕兆。據莫斯科報紙消息，南國執政當局於簽約返國羣衆開槍掃射，其釀成民變，自屬意料中事；何况英國外交，在艾登外相親自指導之下，始終沒有一刻忽視了南國；他如穌聯，旣已不滿於保加利亞的允許德軍假道，當然不願另一斯拉夫國家（塞爾維亞族屬於斯拉夫種）追步後塵，繼之屈從德國；南國幼主和一般頭腦淸醒，酷愛自由的軍人和政治家，在這種內受民意鞭策，外經友邦鼓勵之情景下，脫頴而出，解脫桎梏，豈可視為意外。</p>
<p>盛傳南國新政府業已宣佈「獨立」，它是否逕將簽字不到五天的盟約廢棄，此際雖不可知，但若德國還想援引此約企業侵犯南國的主權和完整，則在反德運動業已瀰漫全國，英美政府相繼宣佈準備援助的今日，事實上恐已至必然引起武力抗戰的境地。據聞德國政府已向貝爾格拉德提出「緊急文件」，要求說明兩點：　對於軸心國抱何態度？　對於三國盟約取何立塲？但一般人推測，此二問題的答案決難使軸心滿意。關於第一問，南國一定聲明願與一切國家友好相處，但必須人不犯我，我不犯人，否則不辭一戰；關於第二問，則惟有請德國注意南國國內近日所發生之事實，舊政府旣為盟約而倒，新政府即使仍準備和軸心簽什麽協定，至少已需要換一種方式和內容。</p>
<p>又自另一方面言之，南國覺醒之後，整個巴爾幹已受到莫大的波動，一說土南兩國不日即將成立互助公約，一說土南希三國準備考慮軍事合作；甚至有人說羅馬尼亞的獨裁首相已發表聲明，要求修改割讓外錫爾伐尼亞的維也納協定，以免引起國內紛擾。然則，瞻望前途，不僅巴爾幹協商公約或將復活，即業已屈膝的若干巴爾幹國家，今後似也有聯帶受到波動的可能。</p>
<p>無怪南菲決理斯末資將軍這樣說：「德國在巴爾幹戰爭中，已被一個幼童彼得所擊敗，」這是一個非常的奇　！</p>
<h3>南國新君秉政　英美致電祝賀</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫國京城　新君彼得二世業於昨日宣誓即位、其誓文內容如下、「朕於即位之初、謹誓於上帝之前曰、朕當致力於民族之統一、國家之獨立與領土之完整、依照憲法治理國政、並時刻以人民福利為念、願上帝助朕、亞們」、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>英候選人傳已推定</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日來盛傳本市英美日三方刻正進行更變工部局董事席之種種討論、惟據今日（二十九日）探悉、英僑方面業已推定英董候選人五名、故本年度工董退舉結果如何、仍未可決、聞央董五候選人、即係現任英董凱斯威（工部局總董）·鮑威爾·海萊·米契爾·與麥唐納五氏、惟工部局某員今晨拒不披露已推定各英董之姓名、據稱、推定之候選人、容有變更、故局方非至推舉候選人已屆截止期、則不便披露其姓名、</p>

<h3>法租界當局將竭力　獲取運米船隻　到米由兩租界合作分配　米號二百餘家要求保障</h3>
<p>英文上美晚報云、工部局頃已宣布、不久將設置小組委員會、旨在借租船隻、得由仰光每月運米一萬五千噸至二萬頓來滬、至局勢好轉時為止、至於法租界方面、據公董局某員聲稱、該局雖不致直接參與租船之舉、但已表示必與工部局全力合作、以應付一般米况之意嚮云、聞法租界當局將竭其所能、獲取法政府統制之船隻、從越南運米來此、而米糧運到時、兩局將合作分配之、</p>
<p>米號要求</p>
<p>關於前日山西路萬源米號、被控超越限價、判處徒刑、全市米號、認為營業無保障、昨日下午、有二百餘家同業、相的粉紛到該公會請示辦法、要求保障、經該會某委員囑令靜候當局公允解決、始各散去、</p>
<p>行棧存底</p>
<p>工部局據豆米行業同業公會本月二十六日列單報吿、截至同日為止、浦東虹口以及蘇州河以南兩租界內各行棧、總結存米八四一·二七五包、比一星期前所報吿者、增加三八·三七〇包、</p>
<p>公倉催款</p>
<p>上海食米公倉委員會、自議決訂購第一批倉米八萬包後、經該會負責人各方接洽、商定價格、茲聞現巳完全決定、向接孚洋行訂立合同、該批倉米、大的五月中可以由仰光裝運抵滬、至各業對於倉米認購款項、續收有五金業一萬一千五白四十二元五角、紗廠業三萬元、荳米雜糧業八萬六千、一百七十五元、總計連前所收者、共述六百七十七萬四千六百零五元、惟荳米雜糧業中、廣幫愼守堂應派二千五百包、允担任七百四十五包已繳四百二十五包、潮糖雜貨業應派二千五百包、允一千包款尚未繳、又米號業及泉漳會館、始終未有切實認數、業已函催、務望照原派數額、設法籌足、即日照繳、以免貽誤、</p>
<h3>减電限制辦法　將有變更</h3>
<p>上海電力公司、以燃科缺乏、前曾取得工部局同意、公佈凡用電量每月超過一千度者、必須减少百分之三十、此項辦法、雖已實行、但以其並非科學化、且對日商獨厚對華商則頗予打擊</p>
<p>亦不公平</p>
<p>故該公司特邀請中英日三國專家組織專門委員會、俾研究一最公允適當之辦法、經數旬來將全市用戶用電狀况等各項報吿縝密討論後、業已分全巿用戶為十大類別、其中除有關社會安全之各項事業、決予暫不限制其需要外、聞對其餘各類之供給辦法、亦已大部</p>
<p>草擬完成</p>
<p>故該會任務在最短期內、即可吿一段落、至一般之减電數量、聞或有較、所公佈百分之三十之數字更多减少之可能、但詳情則未允發威、此新擬辦法、全部完成後、將由工部局核准予以實施、屆時减電之臨時辦法、即宣佈取消、</p>

<p>南華綫</p>
<p>上海至溫州頭等（即官艙）五十五元、二等（即房艙）四十五元、三等（即吊鋪）三十五元、四等（即統艙）二十元、至福州頭等六十五元、二等五十元，三等四十元、四等二十八兀、至厦門頭等八十五元、二等五十五元、三等四十五元、四等三十五兀、至汕頭頭等九十元、二等六十五元、三等五十元、四等三十五元、至香港頭等一百十元、二等八十五元、三等六十五元、四等四十五元、廣州雖無直達英輪可去、其價目照例頭等一百二十元、二等一百元、三等七十二元、四等五十元</p>
<p>滬防綫</p>
<p>即上海至海防、經海口海口前因軍事關係、亦曾一度停灣、近來太古公司輪船、每二星期有一船可兼灣、北海至今尙停靠、客票價目依然規定、上海至海口頭等一百四十五元、二百一百十元、三等八十元、四等五十五元、至北海頭等一百六十五元、二等一百三十五元、三等九十元、四等六十五元、至海防頭等二百二十元、二等一百六十五元、三等一百十元、四等八十五元、海防係法屬越南境、入境須納稅、稅額計頭等八元、二等四元、三四等均為二元、査上述</p>

<h3>自來火大量用戶　廢止折扣</h3>
<p>據工部局發表、本局頃核准上海自來火公司廢止大量煤氣用戶之付費折扣辦法、此後各用戶煤氣費用、一律按照現行收費率徵收、即每十立方呎收費三分、外加附加費、</p>
<p>査本局在本年正月問核准目來火公司提增附加費至百分之二五〇之時、曾將該公司所提關於供給條件之修改辦法若干項、加以考慮、上項修改辦法、目的在乎限制煤氣之消費量、蓋因煤氣消費量之較增、於是需用煤斤與燃油亦較多也、本局一面復將公司收費情形、加以硏究、結果認為大量用戶、仍如平時之享受折扣利益、此於一般家庭用戶、有欠公允、故折扣辦法、應予廢止、並准自用戶煤氣用期在下次抄表以後起開始實行、</p>

<h3>辣斐德路上的文化</h3>
<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>辣斐影戲院是附近兒童們的唯一的樂園。這戲院是仿照國泰戲院建築的，沒有樓座，相當的軒敝，座位很寬舒、也沒有別家小戲院那種污濁噪雜的現象。所映的影片，都是美國第一流片子，而以大光明映過的片子最多，偶而也放映一二張中國影片。所以看影戲的觀衆，可不上大光明去購那高貴的座位，而守候着到辣斐上演的時候去看，遲看早看那有什麽關係呢。雖然近來辣斐的座價也漲到五角和七角，比較人影戲院究竟還是便宜的。每當星期六的下午和星期日，戲院門前常擠滿着無數的觀衆，而以孩子們佔着最大多數，等候裏面的觀衆散塲出來，爭着湧走去搶奪較好的坐位。因為每塲影戲老是這樣擁擠，而孩于們總是乖巧地不顧一切去爭搶坐位，大人們反而不好意思和她們競爭，只得落後了。</p>
<p>因為成羣的學童在這段馬路上從早到晚不息地來來往往，辣斐影戲院的營業是這樣的發達，所以附近的商店也都加倍的利市。近一年來文具商店。舊書店，小書攤等等，不斷地添設出來。因為書價高漲了，一般中學生等都到這裏來搜購他們所需要的舊敎科書。這裏的舊書攤有五六處，還有一家單開間的舊書店，常在報上登着徵求看小說的基本讀者的廣吿。他是道段馬路上的舊書大本營，特別多的是各色新舊小說。舊書攤上生意最好的是敎科書。這些書攤都是用肥皂箱裝着書陳列在馬路旁邊。還有家書店獨多綫裝石印木板的舊籍，所以他的顧客都是戴眼鏡八字鬚的老先生。有一家的書攤規校相當的大，而以學生顧客最多，每當攤主有事或遇天雨的時候，他總在攤基的牆壁上掛着一條市招，說明木書「店」今天因事或因雨停止營業等字樣，這似乎也是招攬主顧的一法。還有一個書攤，專售從前被稱為一折八扣書的小說筆記，這種書現在都印上了五彩的封面，售價也高貴了許多。還有一家啟明書局的分號，啟明是隨一折八扣書興盛的時代崛起的，他當初是編集現代的創作，為便利一般的讀者，用最低的定價類乎一折八扣的價格出售的。而現在則以世界名著的譯本的重譯為大宗，此外也編印了不少的辭典之類，營業是很發達了。此外還有一爿書報雜誌攤，我最初是這報攤上的老主顧，和這靑年的灘主混得很熟，也曾為他而寫個一篇特寫。他最初的規模很小，僅有幾種大小各報，現在是五花八門各種報紙雜誌，如旅行雜誌，天下事，西風，良友，以及各種電影畫報歌曲之類都有。年靑的攤主是戰後失業而自力更生的人，我天天看到他的報攤逐漸地擴充興盛起來，我常暗暗地為他欣喜而祝福他。（續完）</p>

<h3>金市曲折多盤　而變動不大</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤情况、依然平疲、終日徘徊於六千五百元內外、原以匯市續硬、人心散漫無勁、價遂難以向上、晨初一度曾見六千四百七十五元低盤、中以恒記成記天元拋塞允力、嗣幸大豐新豐永等補空、德大亦撈、遂可升至六千五百十八元、後雖再度跌入六千五百元關、惟收盤賴恒記拉提、故尙有六千五百零八元、結果又跌二十八元、交易尙旺、的計一萬四千兩、掉期三月轉入四月、初由祥和貼進過四十五兀、做開一百七十兩、最利益大肯五十元貼出、有四百兩成交、現金亦疲、合盛售予公和一百兩、價照期交高一百八十元、益大出聯興二十兩、高一百九十元、比上日的軋小四十元、飾余等仍平、</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市即低二十六元、計六千五百十兀、時市勢稍形混亂、退至六千四百九十元、又抬至六千五百十元、恒記成記犬元益利來售出、聞滬西幫亦出、步降三十五元、至六千四百七十五元、九點半後、新豐永大生匯票商買進、益大亦買、因德大力進、故有代滬西幫說，盤出六千五白兀外、升至六千五百十八元、鑫源恒記又力售、撳小至六千四百八十五元、恒記復進、順源亦買、時散空補建、當又抬至六千五百十元、正上收市六千五百零八元、比上日收價再小二十八元、査已運降三天、共小一百十二元、照四月美金五元三叫三七五結價、為六千五百十七九、計撳九元、上半有四十三元上落、收後又升至六千五百二十元、乃鑫源益大買進也、下午無市、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高二百元、收進比售出低八十九、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍跌六百九十元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<p>外幣續見下降</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤由價報續下降、英美金鎊因亦續降一元、英金票仍呆定、美金票一度退至十八元四角、卒為十八元四角四分、比上日軋跌四分、香港票需要不稀、市價挺漲，日金票及朝鮮票仍不易抬頭、前者續退至二元、後者輪降為一元六角七分、</p>
<h3>銀行準備會　减低劃頭利率　定四月一日起實行　在定額以外不計息</h3>
<p>上海巿銀行業聯合準備委員會、昨日分函各銀行略云、本市因國外時局關係、流資增多、本會交換存款與同業存款均增、坐耗利息頗鉅、與中中交三行商妥、劃頭存款利率依各行平時應付票款需要及存款平均情形、分別酌定存款計息限度、逐日餘額在限度以內者、交換銀行存款改按年息一厘半計算、其他同業存款、改按年息一厘二毫生計算，超過限度者、均不計息、定四月一日起實行云云、聞各銀行限額、高低不一、由該會分別規定、自數百萬元至數十萬元不等、</p>
<p>查銀行準備會劃頭存款利率、原為一律三厘、自去年十一月一日起將交換銀行存款减一厘、改為二厘、交換銀行以外之同業存款减一厘二毫牛、改為一厘七毫牛、當時各商業銀行、有即借用該會减息之理由、實行减低活息、現在各行活期存款利率、祇有年息二三厘、如各銀行再隨之而减低存息、勢必促存戶多以其齊作他用、或即為銀行所利用、兩者必有一於是、現在各銀行頗多於定章以外、種種限制、的束存戶、一再嫂變、焉知不有轉向存戶收保管費之日、以各銀行皆於效舉、恐有不免、（公）</p>
<h3>證劵　統戌有人專收</h3>
<p>公　佔暗盤、昨日市况、趨勢九略帶堅、惟戌種最俏、此因其多日來順昌號專收戊種、每日收進十萬二十萬不等、致行市無形中巳被抬高、丙種平時多頭因其將於四月十日抽籤、故均會集於此、多頭太多、逢高即有人吐出、是以抬頭不起、餘不過隨時起落而巳、昨為週六、祇做上午一盤、順昌仍有買進、餘如信孚·同康·新華·等雖為數無多、但仍係一貫買進、順亨·聯益·中一·等均有進胃、聯和多頭出籠較多、大通·大中·德隆·五和·均有賣出、結果大都略漲五分一角至三角半、丙種微小五分、成交的共一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>股　票交易、成交華商證劵交易所股二百股、價為三十二元五角、</p>

<h3>紗花　多空相持不下　紗市盤旋</h3>
<p>紗巿復人於盤旋之途、但多空兩方爭持依然劇烈也、所以徬徨甚力、但實際銷路殊為沉悶、本日港幫僅十包交易、其他完全係皮球生意、大家踢來踢去、甚為熱鬧、實際絕無生色也、二十支雙馬最高價為一千三白九十四元、低價為一千三百八十四元、午後因週末、鴉雀無聲、目前紗巿等待新變化來、再有大上下也、多方因百物高昂看升、空方為銷路海運狹隘、存貸有增無减望下、</p>
<p>變馬晨開承上日虛弱之氣續見不振、首盤價為一千三百八十九元、少頃微升至一千三百八十八元半、旋聞金價開出下降、人氣稍衰、賣者活動、跌至一千三百八十五元、然低價一見而不下、反有盤勢、盈利者一扒、及新多者活躍、父升至一千三百九十四元、但現紗交易不佳、又回下至一千三百九十二元收盤、査牛日間成交統計六千〇十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一〇同行六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計六、〇一〇</p>
<h3>棉市廠商觀望</h3>
<p>昨日棉巿平而無特色、惟價格依然堅昂、蓋以滬埠存底日减、外棉到埠亦頗不易、如美種細絨之類、大衆咸為重視、廠家納胃不張、又以週六關係、共計成交外棉五百五十件、又華棉一千〇三十六包、價漲一元之譜、致交易尙不踴躍、茲錄昨日成交行巿如左、</p>
<p>惠司登　二九〇·〇　同業一〇〇件</p>

<p>又　三〇·〇　又　六〇〇包</p>
<p>美米得林三九〇·〇　又　一五〇件</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因大衆買進、及農部委員會同意棉麥借款之消息、從華成盛頓傳來而高漲、唯續後又因一部分獲利了結而稍有降落、結果收盤價格、較之上日高滙十六七磅音不等、</p>
<p>又同日紐的電、去年八月一日起至今年二月二十八日止統計錄後、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>共上市九　九、六八一、〇〇〇包</p>

<p>至英國　三三八、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>至德國　三九一、〇〇包</p>
<p>現存　六、四三、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印度棉市、晨初因大戶竭力支持而漲、又因棉商套賣而跌、後冉因投機者取巧買進而漲、結果又因大衆了結、及股票軟弱而缺、昨日收盤價格低落三至六羅比不等、又預測今日開盤尙堅、看高二羅比有半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、仍在逡巡小進之狀態、廠方大半抱觀望態度、無意採購、但市况尙織堅定、而有挺進之趣向也、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖漲風愈勁</h3>
<p>昨糖巿據荷蘭電訊、荷赤隆價為美金二·八五、照C·I·F例、粗車白因新囤戶繼起吸收、漲風方興未艾、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白初為八十八元至八十七元八角、旋升至八十八元半至八十九元、升一元八角、期貨四月十日打單八十八兀二角至五角、後又升至八十九元·九元半·九元四角、四月二十日打單八十八元八角·九元·九元半、後更升至九十元至九十元〇五角·三角，升一元二角至一元半、荷赤六十八元八角至六十九元、升一元、太古車白Ｂ嘜八十九元至九十元、升一元四角、ＤＹ嘜八十四元五角至八十五元半、升一元一角、ＨＸ嘜八十三元八角至八十四元半、本一號冰一百十四元、晶明冰一百十五元、均升一元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　海峯煤暗市　—又加三十元</h3>
<p>白煤中氣、近日愈形尖銳、推其原因還在行家大批囤藏、關住不出、明盤有行無市、店家祗得高價搜收棧單、以資應巿、致暗市步步喊高、昨海峯白煤老棧單、巳開三百五十元、又加三十元、本街門莊、送到客家、篩塊每噸三百六十八元云、</p>
<h3>五金　點錫鋼條並昂</h3>
<p>點錫　九九九成點錫巿面、隨各貨標準之疾漲、亦吿挺昂、昨市已喊五千元出零、且無躉批之現貨、査該貨新加坡及香港等處之來源、早經斷檔、所能應市者、僅本街之存底而已、因之同業人心、異常奮發、行盤節節上騰、</p>
<p>鋼條　竹節鋼條交易、雖建築幫納胃淸閒、客戶去化寥寥、然因巿貨不豐、來路缺乏，執貨者心思依然高昂、標準市價反見有漲無落、查其原因、除囤戶幫極力吸進外、執貨者居奇心思亦應參半、故昨市已沽二千元關外、</p>
<h3>絲茶　綠茶微有走銷</h3>
<p>洋莊茶葉交易、僅不着色之鳳眉蝦目等貨、美莊微有走銷、昨由怡和錦隆等行、買進該項綠茶百餘箱、售價自二百六十元至二白八十五元、此外無色珍眉綠茶、行家亦有電訊發出推銷、但未開始動辦、二十九日有茶葉六十四件自香港來、</p>
<h3>疋頭　白直貢呢價貴</h3>
<p>白直貢呢、現市塲上極形缺乏、且本廠貨無出品、東西舶來品運到大减、舊存底貨有限、而其出路方面、大半雖說昂貴、但其實銷仍暢、因之隨成求過於供、市氣趨俏、標準行情、漲之又漲、昨好華二二　老牌白直貢呢、每碼批售五十元、普通英製貨齊售四十元左右、福泰牌子售三十二元、東貨頭號售三十一元、二號甘七八元、三號廿三四元、</p>
<h3>雜項　牛皮羊毛有進口</h3>
<p>二十九日進口貨自喀爾喀搭來者有蔴五百四十八件、由香港來者、有羊毛二百七十七件牛皮九十件、</p>
<h3>南北貨　山東枝降十元</h3>
<p>雜路枝下、近以去化較狹、趨勢轉疲、査號貨前到者迄水開通、故最近開出一批、巳降十餘元、行盤遂亦跟跌、昨山東枝售七十二元、海口枝四十元、其他鳥葉枝囚走塲寥寥、竟乏正市云、</p>
<h3>藥材　山查片去化漸活</h3>
<p>山查片自開價見緊以來、港粵幫去胃亦漸活動、故市勢因之轉挺、昨市凈貨售四十四兀、毛貨四十二元、査近日乏到、而巿存亦不過厚、後市看有續緊可能、</p>
<h3>玉蜀黍</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>新大陸這座「寳藏，」自從公元一四九二年被哥倫布首先把它打開以後，便有多少不可估價的奇珍環寶，源源的流向世界各處，以作我們世人養身餬口，醫病提神的資料啊！「玉」蜀黍！「珍珠」米—又是一個絕好的例子。</p>
<p>玉蜀黍又名珍珠米，或苞穀，在我國北方最普通的名字，則是棒子：字不見於字書，它得這名字的由來，也無從査考；或者因為它成熟的穗子彷彿一隻棒棰，由棒字傳訛變成棒字了吧。西班牙人稱它為Maiz，大概係美洲印第安人的原來的稱呼。我國的初有玉蜀黍，當然是在明末的時候：然而它是由葡萄牙人從澳門傳人的呢？或者如同番薯一樣是從呂宋的移植？現在極力搜索，尙苦得不着一點蛛絲馬跡；至於輸入或廣播它的功臣的名字，—比方我們至少尙可知道金學曾和林懷蘭的輸入番薯，—更是不用提了。</p>
<p>我國對於玉蜀黍最早的記載，莫過於李時珍的本草綱目，他說：『玉蜀黍樓出西士，種者亦罕。其葉苗俱似蜀黍肥肥矮，亦似薏苡。苗高一四尺，六七月開花成穗如秕麥狀。苗心別出一苞，如樓魚形，苞上出自鬚垂垂；久則苞折子出，顆顆攢簇。子亦大如棧子，可菜炒食之：炒折白花，如炒折糯米之狀。』徐文定公在農政全書上也說：「薥詐，古無有也，後世或從他方得其種。……別有一種玉米，或稱玉麥，或稱玉薥梳，蓋亦從他方得種，其曰米，麥，薥梳，皆借名之也·」李時珍說「種出西方，』徐文定公說「蓋亦從他方得種，』固然可以證明玉蜀黍不是我國的土著，可是怎麽知道它的祖國是在新大陸呢？以下所引證的，是不按原文次序的法國Contiere所著生物世界的大意，並加以補充和說明。</p>
<p>古埃及人和印度人全沒有玉蜀黍這種植物的名詞，在宗敎方面，也找不出有拿它作為祭祀或其他儀式的痕跡來。希臘人與羅馬人也不認識它是什麽東西。—就是我們中國的「一農生九穀：」其中所包括的有黍稷豆麥等，也何嘗有玉蜀黍的影蹤？無疑的，它的祖幽是不在舊大陸上，而是社美洲啊。</p>
<p>當白種人發現了美洲而在各處探尋它的各種寳藏時，他們南從阿根廷的拉巴拉他河口起，北到加拿大的哈得遜灣止，到處可以見到這葱籠繁茂，雄壯高偉的玉蜀黍。而且印第安人對它，各部落有各部落特別的名稱：不特每日三餐用以果腹的惟它是賴，就是在大數告盡嗚呼哀的時候，也是拿它的穗子作為在墳墓中殉葬的極重要的材料：這，或者是拿它作為在其國旅行時的資斧，或者是預備餽送牛頭阿旁，作為平息他們怒氣的苞苴—印第安人也相信鐵面無私的閻羅，是可以用賄賂叫他們軟化的，眞是奇怪——不特此也，印第安人為崇功報德所恭敬的大神，也是「玉蜀黍神：」每年有例定的祀神的日期，所陳列奉獻的各種神秘的祭品，也沒有不是用玉蜀黍的麵粉作成的（未完）</p>

<h3>兒童節給小朋友們</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>親　愛的小朋友們！</p>
<p>四月四日的兒童節快要來了。在這生氣蓬勃的佳節中，春光早巳把你們籠罩住了。你們有的是天眞的心地，有的是活潑的精神，快樂之神在你們面前搖擺着。你們的前途是遠大的，你們的希望，是無限的，親愛的小朋友呵！這兒童節的良辰，是你們極樂的時候，你們共同在父母的撫養和師長的訓導之下，嘗着了甜蜜生活的滋昧，這快樂的人生，巳是被你們佔有了，你們那個小期望人生的快樂的呢？那個不承認生命是寳貴的呢？你們的淸晰靈活，潔凈的頭腦，一定不會健忘了這個：但我更鄭重地祝福你們，祝你們永遠抱着這快樂的人生觀，而把這敏慧的心思，去用在將來為人羣謀生存，為社會謀幸福的工夫上面去，因此我更望你們別要妄動，別要盲從，幸福不是從祈禱中得來的，也不是人家所給予的，是須要由你們自己奮鬥得來。你們的前進目標，首先求自己身心健全的發展，再進而謀全人羣的快樂！</p>
<p>你們是現社會的生力軍，你們須用毅力去奮鬥，用積極持久的精神，以博得你們最後的勝利。你們千萬不要害怕，不要退縮。親愛的小朋友們呀！這黑漆漆的宇宙，正待你們去開鑿光明之路，在沉睡迷醉的人生，正待你們的天眞去推醒他們，去溫熱他們的巳冷的心窩……</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們呵！千萬請你們原諒，別鄙視，別摒棄，而接受了我這淺薄的好意吧！祝你們生命之花璨爛！</p>
<h3>利用春假</h3>
<p>— 影東</p>
<p>今　年的春假，和往年有所不同，時間方面，變更了一些。自黃花崗紀念，三月二十九日起，一連放假九天，到四月六日為止。九天的時間，說畏並不長，但說短也不短，而我們大可利用這九天的假期，作學術上的進修。俗語說，「一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨。」明白到這一點，那麽我們該把這一個春假抓住了，充分的去利用一下才對。如果要利用春假，那麽第一步，小朋友，就可就定一個計劃。</p>
<p>首先，在春假裹面，就是學校方面並不規定春假作業，但我們也應得自動的確定了在九天的假期之中，將做些什麽工作。無論是看書也好，寫作也好。小考已經考過了，那麼可尋出那幾科成續不大好的，在春假中溫習；要是春假後就要小考，那麼止好利用這春假來預備考試。他如所有課外作業，如大小楷，日記，算術習題等，就是老師沒有指定，也得照平常一樣的工作，切勿因假期而荒廢。這樣雖然祇九天，當也有相當的進步。</p>
<p>讀書，當然也不能一天到晚讀，所以我們可把九天的假期，劃定一個界限。照我看來，每天早上，無論如何，要溫習功課的，午後不妨當作運動或遊春之用。往常春假之中，我們都要作遠足旅行，但現在戰事尙未結束，要想遠足，也為環境所不許，那祇有往幾個公園裏去遊玩，或邀幾個朋友，在一起運動，如打乒乓，踢小球，或討論學術，不拘形式，於智力旣可進步，於身體又可健康。總之，到野外去踏靑，放風箏，都是有益的，大家可各隨所喜，分頭做去。</p>
<p>槪括的說，春大是大好的光陰，無論讀書遊樂，都是適宜，而特別可貴的是春犬的早晨，空氣新鮮，腦筋靈敏，無論讀書寫字，都容易進步。所以在春假裏，至少應把每大的上午，充分的去利用，作為進修學業的時間，希望小朋友們，大家勿荒廢掉呢！</p>
<h3>兒歌遊戲</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>春天到，</p>
<p>天氣好，</p>
<p>草兒靑，</p>
<p>鳥兒唱。</p>
<p>有的鳥，</p>
<p>飛來了。</p>
<p>小朋友：</p>
<p>請你猜猜看，</p>
<p>這是什麽鳥？</p>
<p>（把下圖的數目字連接起來便可知道了！）</p>
<h3>競爭本領</h3>
<p>— 雅民</p>
<p>有天，太陽和風正在競爭本領，費了許久，終不能決定孰勝孰負？後來它們看見一個老年人在路上蹣跚而行。風就提議說：「誰能使路上的老年人脫去衣服，誰就算勝利。」太陽立刻和議了。</p>
<p>風開始發展它的暴力，拼命底在吹，可是老年人見風吹得越猛烈，他越把衣服裏得緊。風雖弄得筋疲力盡，終不能使那老年人脫去衣服。等到太陽放出了和煦的陽允後，那老年人覺得溫暖起來，便自動地脫去衣服。結果風遭了失敗。</p>
<p>因此太陽很得意的，且帶些訓敎的語調，對風說：「倚仗暴力，脅迫他人是無用的，不若溫和一點的好呢！」</p>
<h3>滿足</h3>
<p>— 童友</p>
<p>有人問佛蘭克林道：「富人爲什麽也不幸福？」佛蘭克林看見一籃蘋果，取了一隻遞給在房內玩耍的一個孩子，小孩用他的小手接了去。佛蘭克林連忙又給他一個，小孩伸出另一隻手來取去。佛蘭克林撿了一隻更大的，又給了他，孩子還想用手去拿，可是三隻蘋果都掉在地上，孩子便大哭起來。</p>
<p>於是佛蘭克林道：「你看小孩不能滿足他的財物，這就是富人不幸福的原因。」</p>
<p>讀了上面的故事，我們知道侵略者也不是幸福的。</p>
<h3>康元玩具徵文父母之部第二名　我的孩子與康元玩具</h3>
<p>— 鄭理農</p>
<p>飄流到了孤島，已整整三年了。看着孩子們一個個大了起來，才想到自己，漫步踱入了中年。在他們天真的笑臉上，我感着已逝的一段青春，又在身邊活躍了。</p>
<p>我懷念中的故鄕，有泥土香的故鄉：那裏依着靑山，繞着小河，有無際的田野，沐在靜靜的陽光中。春天放紙鳶；夏天捉蟈蟈；秋夜裏我數着繁星，做了個螢籠，懷着滿天星斗入夢；冬天下雪的日子，是最快樂的時候了—宇宙是一座大工廠，有無窮的玩具，讓你拾取。</p>
<p>如今局促於斗室之中，戶外是嘈雜的街，衖口又是煩囂的街。三年以來，心情也變得更蒼老了。回到家裏，眼看兩個孩子，在不潔的環境下生活着，覺得簡直是一種罪惡。妻主張不能讓他們在外面玩，免得染了吵架，吃小食的惡習慣，道是合理的。然而室內幾尺周圍，在他們幼茁的心靈中，天地眞是太小了。像兩朶憔悴的花，沒有太陽雨露的滋潤，我懷疑將來，他們會有飽滿健全的精神。</p>
<p>去年聖誕節相近，帶了他們從公司裏回來，也帶回了一大堆夢想；吵着買玩具。他們不知道，在高貴的標價上，巳把做爸爸的高興打散了。但當我迥想幼年，在白禮氏洋燭中，拆得一隻紙做的撰球，是我唯一的恩物時的心情，我有說不出的悵惘了。故鄉的天地，雖是廣闊，然而令我不能忘懷，還是洋燭將用完了的一種等待，和吹了開來，非拍碎不止的快樂。那末在五光十色的擺駛窗裏，引起孩子們的驚奇，向我訴說，向我要求，是並不過份的事了。有一天，我下了決心，在預算中勉强加了玩具一項。心想：在這都市裏，五月草長，沒有蝴蝶也罷，孩子們應有一隻『活動蝴蝶』。又當那新秧初挿，水田蛙聲，依然在奏靜夜的交響曲，而孩子們却遠離它們而來上海了。我應買給『隻跳蛙』，併吿訴他們萬千蛙聲合奏的音樂。</p>
<p>兩個月來，斗室的沉悶空氣，突然打破了，原因是我買了不少康元玩具。這不是說我在店裏加了薪，而是說康元出品比舶來便宜十倍甘倍，乃一般所能負担的。孩子們玩厭了就拋，等一會又想玩了，康元出品多是鉛皮做的，不容易毀壞。於是『小鷄：小鴨子」，也養了幾隻了，「金虫」「蝴蝶」也在飛了。把籘椅倒了過來，當作籬笆，面盆算是池塘，故鄕的田園，彷彿就在目前，我們又把是主人了！</p>
<p>阿大是二年級，似乎懂得戰爭的意義了。把『發火坦克車』，『巨型飛機』，「機關槍」。收住了成為他個人的機械化步隊，不肯讓弟弟玩。但是弟弟却喜歡「升線猴」和「鱷魚」，大概是到過兆豐公園動物院，想抱猴子回來的緣故吧？更喜歡用鱷魚同哥哥的步隊來鬥，並堅決相信鱷魚曾吞下一切的。看鱷魚一拐一拐地爬着，把我們也引樂了。</p>
<p>『終有一天，阿大也許眞的駕着一輛坦克車，在戰塲上馳騁吧？』我倚在牀上想着。</p>

<h3>明星的合同條件</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>好萊塢的電影雜誌上時常有令人莫測高深的消息吿訴我們，是事實抑是宣傳，弄得局外人如墮五里霧中。如明星們合同中的許多奇怪而有趣的條件，亦是其一。</p>
<p>默片時代紅極一時的滑稽明星裴斯間登，他底合同上是特別有一條訂定：在銀幕上不許一展笑容，吾則便以不履行條的罪向法院起訴，所以裴斯開登被稱為「冷面滑稽」。</p>
<p>闢嘴巴喬意勃朗的合同中，規定他不許留髭，因為他的動人之處，就在口部的特別關大，假使留了髭鬚，豈不是要把他的特點遮掩了嗎？</p>
<p>埃洛茀林於台同中，訂明彼於攝製二片之間，須有兩星期之完全休息。在此時期中，公司裏不論有何重大事項，須取問於彼者，即致一電話亦屬不能，亦條件中之別開生面者。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥的合同最為詳盡，瑣屑如何時到塲工作，何時返家，均一一言明，是亦可見其性格之一斑。</p>
<p>嘉寳及考爾門拍戲向不喜外人參觀，於訂的時言明公司不能强彼等以眞面目示人。</p>
<p>勞萊哈台的合同中，均有明文眼定，人體重必須在某種重量之上或之下，逾此即有解約危險，故二人對於體育上之活動，不得不特別注意，以免發胖與消瘦。</p>
<p>華雷斯皮萊是出名的「看鐘朋友」，只要辰光一到，他便不顧一切，不問這幕戲是如何重要，這幕佈景費了多少余錢，他總是毫無關係似的大踏步而出，公司中人，無可奈何，因合回中訂定如此也。</p>
<p>巳故大明星千圖人郞却乃，彼所號召者為化裝術、神奇，公司視如珍寳，乃不許其以眞面目示人，故欲得睹其廬山眞面目，非先向公司疏通不可。</p>
<p>總之好萊塢著名明星合同中之條約，常有異想大開不敢令人前信者，其實都是「宜傳」之道而巳。</p>

<p>李信以為他們是要錢，便吩咐一個家人到裏面去取。又問大漢道：「你們從那裏來？這位姑娘的技藝着實不錯，是你的什麽人？」大漢答道：「我姓佟，伊是我的妹妹，一路賣解到此的。」李信點點頭，說聲「很好」。家人巳託了一盤紋銀出來，盤中裝着五十兩銀子，放在桌上。李信便指着銀子，對二人說道：「這一些銀錢是我送給你們的，請你們不要客氣，收了吧。」大漢聞言，對紅衣女子笑了一笑，却不答語。李信以為他們嫌少，正要再說時，大漢早走到李信身邊，輕輕說道：「我們有幾句緊要的話要和李爺一說，請李爺屛退左右，方敢直言。」李信聽了，不由怔，遂咐吩旁邊伺候的莊丁一齊退去。大漢又囁嚅着不說。這個樣子，李信怎小懷疑起米？忍不住問道。「你們有什麼話，儘管直說好了？此地又沒有旁人，請你放心。」那大漢又向兩邊望了一望，方說道：「剛才我向李爺說的話，尙有不實之處，務請李爺原諒。我們並非賣解的人，實在是靑石山上的頭領。我是佟天豹，伊是我的妹妹佟天鳳，就是人家稱說，「紅娘子」的。因我們本來也是走江湖賣藝的，後來我們到了青石山上，聚集一般弟兄，幹起綠林生涯來。現聞陝西李自成等揭竿而起，聲勢很盛，意欲在此響應，將來可以爭取天下，共圖富貴。不過覺得自己的聲勢還小盛大，尙須得信望素著的人，舉旗而起，號召四方·素知李公子在這裏有孟嘗平原之名，豪傑之士都願歸附，若得李爺允許，同我們一齊起義，河南之地不難唾手而得。現在明室的國祚亦將吿終，草莽間英雄奇士應當乘時而起，李爺原是第一平原公子，何不乘勢以圖天下？（二五）</p>
<h3>且莫輕視「打英雄」</h3>
<p>— 耑員</p>
<p>武行共分武生，武旦，武凈，武其及「打英雄」等數種，「打英雄」即「上下手」之別名，此類角色乃係武戲中之襯手，如「慶頂珠」之衆敎師，「連環套」之衆頭目，皆屬於「打英雄」之短打一路戲者；長靠戲則如「長板坡」之曹營八將，「八大鎚」之衆錘將是也。（但此八人中，自不能完全以「打英雄」充之，因其中之著名大將，仍須由武凈或二一路武生飾演，至不重要之將官，始由「打英雄」充之。）</p>
<p>梨園慣例，凡任武行開者，多係摔打花臉，後臺雖各有負責人，然事無論大小，仍須與其斟酌辦理。多數之打英雄者，對唱唸作白，從不研究，內行中有「上手怕戰盤河，下手怕武當山」兩句術語，良以上下手皆不能開口，而「戰盤河」之家將一角，例由上手飾演，應有「大事不好了，二老爺被亂箭射死了」兩句唸白；又「武當山」之看守角，例由下手扮演，應有「天氣尙早，打擂臺的還沒有來」兩句唸白，故此二角色，上下手均被為畏途。</p>
<p>當名武生李春來盛時，嘗自帶所謂哼哈二將，四大金剛，十六個「筋斗虫」者：沈韻春，鞠德奎，譚永奎等胥屬於兩將四金剛列；即所謂「筋斗虫」者，亦草不武藝高强，功夫出衆也。</p>

<h3>Uncontrollable Balkans: Nations Trapped in Dilemma; Romania Follows Suit, Demanding Revision of Territorial Cession Decision; Greece and Turkey May Establish Military Alliance</h3>
<p>New York - Yugoslavia's anti-Axis coup d'état has caused Germany serious and complex consequences. Hitler is in a dilemma, having to decide whether to use force to restore the old government of Yugoslavia or wait for future developments to avoid future dangers. If Hitler adheres to the policy of conquering small countries by diplomacy rather than force, he will probably not take hasty action. The German side believes that the alliance agreement has been signed by Yugoslavia and that there is no need to interfere in its internal affairs. However, if the Yugoslav government officially does not recognize the alliance treaty, Hitler will hesitate to launch a military strike. The Yugoslav parliament has not yet ratified the agreement, which is a legitimate procedure for delaying the treaty. If Hitler uses force to suppress Yugoslavia, the resistance of the Yugoslav army will inevitably be aided by British troops stationed in Greece, easily igniting a major fire in the entire Balkans. The revolution is highly contagious, and Germany's control in the Balkans will become increasingly difficult. Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu is engaging in major negotiations with Hungary regarding the treatment of Romanians in Transylvania, and there are frequent reports of Bulgarian sabotage of industry. Turkey's attitude is particularly influenced by the situation in Yugoslavia. According to news from the past 48 hours, Moscow originally intended to reconsider its friendship with Germany if Yugoslavia were to be drawn in by Germany. Therefore, the impact on Germany is very complex. If force is not used, it will inevitably affect Germany's prestige in the Balkans. Even more unfortunately, this matter has made a very poor impression on Matsuoka Yosuke, who is currently visiting Berlin. Germany originally tried to demonstrate how it controls Europe, but what Matsuoka saw was Germany's weakness. It is difficult to predict what course of action Hitler will take in the future, as even he himself cannot decide. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Newspapers here recently published the following declaration by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu: "I recently had to request the authorities in Berlin and Rome to revise the Vienna Award, otherwise there will be incidents in Romania. I believe that unless the issue of Transylvania is resolved, there will be no peace in this part of Europe." (Note: According to the Vienna Award, Germany ordered Romania to cede Transylvania to Hungary). Local official reports commented, "The strange declaration of the Romanian leader" and stated that the declaration will shock the world. (TASS, 29th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Romania will change its existing system of government. According to news from Bucharest received by the Vichy News Agency, the current military regime in Romania will soon be replaced by a civilian government. Although General Antonescu will remain Prime Minister, representatives of the Liberal Party and the National People's Party will join the government. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Yesterday, a source from an Axis country here stated that it is rumored in Istanbul that a mutual assistance pact between Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece may be signed soon. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Diplomatic circles here predicted yesterday that a treaty of mutual assistance and military alliance between Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece will soon be announced. It is said that Yugoslav troops are currently concentrated on the Monastir to 　 Ding Qilian front in southern Serbia. (International Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Army Moves Million to Border Daily; Turkey Conducts Paratrooper Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>Belgrade - Reliable sources here declared yesterday that Yugoslavia yesterday dispatched 1.25 million troops to the four defense zones on the German border at full speed and notified Hitler in advance that "certain points" in the Axis treaty were unacceptable to the public. It is now heard that the new Prime Minister General Simović and the entire nation are awaiting a German response in writing or in action. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Ankara - A defense parachute unit exercise was held in Izmir Port on the Aegean coast of Turkey. The scale of the exercise was the largest in the Turkish air force. The public also participated in the exercise, some carrying rifles and other weapons. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Diplomatic sources reported from Bulgaria today that German troops are fully prepared to launch a sudden attack on Greece, but have not yet done so for political reasons. It is reported that German troops have concentrated 150,000 troops in the Pirin region in the southwestern corner of Bulgaria and are preparing to advance westward into the Vardar River valley or southward into the Robel Pass toward Greece. Diplomatic sources said that vehicles departing from Plovdiv have transported German troops to various locations along the eastern border of Thrace. Most of the Bulgarian troops are concentrated on the Turkish border, and the actions and troop deployments of the 　 army now indicate that their first move is against Greece. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Queen Mother Prepares to Return Home; Hears of Son Reclaiming Power; Chronic Illness Suddenly Cured</h3>
<p>London - Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, who was ill in a 16th-century village house in Huntingtonshire, was overjoyed when she received the news that her son Peter II had reclaimed power. Her chronic illness has suddenly been cured, and she will return home with her two young sons who are currently studying in Surrey. She told people, "I have deep faith in my son's future, and I naturally want to be by his side at this time." (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Estimated Strength of Yugoslavia: Land, Sea, and Air Forces Capable of Fighting</h3>
<p>London - Military observers declared today that the Yugoslav army is estimated to have about 1.25 million people. They need anti-tank guns, mechanized units, and mortars. The Yugoslav combat units are well-equipped with rifles and automatic weapons. There are two cavalry divisions, some of which are mechanized, but they still need tanks, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons. Experts also stated that the Yugoslav air force has 48 squadrons with 900 aircraft, of which 450 are first-line fighters, including German Messerschmitt 109s, British Hurricanes, Fierce Fighters, British Blenheims, and German Dornier bombers. The Yugoslav navy was established not long ago and has 8 destroyers, 10 old torpedo boats, 10 motor torpedo boats, 4 submarines, several smaller warships, and 190 merchant ships. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters naval reporter stated that although the Yugoslav navy is small, it is quite strong. If Yugoslavia decides to fight the Axis powers, the Yugoslav navy will greatly trouble the remaining Italian navy. The Yugoslav navy has a total of 6,300 officers and men and 1,120 reservists. Some officers, especially those belonging to submarines, have received training in the British navy. The Yugoslav fleet has 4 good destroyers, with the fifth about to be completed, 4 submarines, several torpedo boats, 6 mine-laying ships and mine-sweeping ships each, several other small boats, and 1 old-fashioned light cruiser. The Yugoslav coast has 3 good naval bases, namely 　 Pula, Kotor, and Šibenik, with Šibenik being the most difficult to attack. The secrets in the straits between the small island bases and various ports are only known to the Yugoslavs. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Germany Decides to Send Memorandum to Yugoslavia, Setting Deadline to Clarify Attitude</h3>
<p>London - The British "Exchange Telegraph" recently carried a telegram from Zurich stating that Germany has decided to give Yugoslavia a deadline of three days to decide its attitude towards the Tripartite Pact. Hitler, Goering, Ribbentrop, and Keitel held a special meeting yesterday, and as a result, this final memorandum was decided. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - "The World News" published a message stating that the German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, inquired of the new Yugoslav Foreign Minister Ninčić yesterday. The response given by Yugoslavia did not seem to satisfy the German side, as the Axis powers cannot regard ambiguous expressions as satisfactory. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - According to well-informed sources here, the German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, has been recalled to his country. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that Germany had not negotiated with the new Yugoslav government's policies, but had received information about anti-German actions in Yugoslavia, so it would protest to the Yugoslav government. One of the clauses in the Tripartite Pact stipulates that the pact is effective in the signatory countries, so it should be implemented without ratification. At the same time, the official German news agency received news from the capital of Bulgaria that traffic between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia has been cut off. Since the coup d'état on Thursday, railways 　 telegraphs and telephones have been completely out of service. The German Foreign Ministry did not express any opinion on the conflicting news coming from Yugoslavia and the difficulties caused by the situation in the Yugoslav capital. German officials only stated that traffic was obstructed, so the situation in Yugoslavia was difficult to determine, and the news was contradictory, making it even more difficult to judge. Political circles in Berlin did not express anything, only stating that the declaration issued by the new Yugoslav government did not reveal its attitude towards the Tripartite Pact. The official German news agency also received news from the capital of Southern Germany stating that the Yugoslav government seemed not to have decided on the policy direction it should adopt. However, there have been important changes in the Yugoslav news agency, with a pro-British figure appointed as president and many editors replaced. According to Nazi opinion, the Axis Pact does not require ratification, so Yugoslavia's accession to this long-standing alliance does not pose a problem. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Sentiment High in Yugoslavia; German Nationals Ordered to Evacuate from Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Belgrade - This afternoon, authoritative German sources stated that not only German nationals in Belgrade City must evacuate, but also German nationals throughout Serbia. However, German nationals residing in Croatia and Slovakia can remain as usual. Only three reporters from Germany remain in Serbia, and the rest have evacuated. One of the three remaining is a reporter from the Haitong News Agency. In total, approximately 300 to 400 German nationals will be evacuated. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared this afternoon that our country is closely monitoring the developments in the capital of Yugoslavia and the growth of anti-German forces among Yugoslav political leaders. The German government has not yet issued a statement on the situation in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has an anti-German tendency due to the high tide of Serbian radicals. The German Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heeren, encountered insults from the crowd on his way to attend the coronation ceremony of Peter II, which was incited by these radicals. It has been confirmed that Heeren met with Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović and Foreign Minister yesterday. In terms of the general situation in Yugoslavia, it does not seem to have changed its basic diplomatic policy, but the situation has not yet been clarified, so there are still conflicting reports about Yugoslavia's intentions continuing to be transmitted here. When Yugoslavia joined the Tripartite Pact, Germany expressed the hope of stabilizing the situation in Southeast Europe, so any 　 forces in Yugoslavia that resist this objective should bear the consequences. (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Communists Hold Demonstrations; Coup Apparently Supported by Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - 30,000 demonstrators from the Yugoslav Communist Party disregarded the ban on gatherings in the streets yesterday and poured into the city center 　, making rebellious pro-Soviet expressions. All available soldiers, tanks, and machine guns in the capital were deployed to key locations to prevent the demonstrations from becoming uncontrollable. However, the demonstrators were clearly carefully organized and maintained good order. A steamboat on the Danube River will carry all Germans leaving the capital of Yugoslavia on Monday. Knowledgeable people say that Germany is preparing to apply unlimited "maximum pressure" to obtain the cooperation of the new Yugoslav regime with the Axis powers. Last night, the Yugoslav United Front seemed to be gradually splitting, which has a serious impact on the future of Yugoslavia. Croats have begun to express opposition to the military in the new regime. Serbians, who are determined to fight Germany, may refuse to support the government's maintenance of neutrality. As for the new government, although it is under pressure from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Greece, it is determined to respect the treaties signed by the previous regime, including the pact to join the Axis powers, but any secret conditions must be abolished. It is said that a "principled" guarantee has been given to the Axis powers. (International News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>New York - American newspapers believe that the coup d'état in Yugoslavia is a loss of prestige for Hitler, but opinions are quite divided on whether he will use force or political means to restore Germany's favorable position in the Balkans. American radio critics were deeply impressed by the Soviet Union's apparent support for the coup d'état by the new Yugoslav leader General Simović. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia had a coup d'état on the night of the 26th of this month. All important officials of the former government were arrested and detained in the headquarters of the General Staff. They have now been released by the government, but former Prime Minister Cvetković and the head of the Belgrade Police Department, Inchkić, have not yet been released. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Balkan Situation</h3>
<p>Just a week ago, the Yugoslav authorities were deeply embracing the Nazis, and Germany was happily preparing to complete the final procedures for accepting this new partner. The Balkan Peninsula, except for Greece, could be said to be largely settled. At that time, this newspaper commented on the matter, expressing its sighs and regrets, but in that moment of despair, it put forward two reservations: Firstly, if Germany wanted to ensure Yugoslavia's peaceful submission as its ally, Hitler must not make further demands; and secondly, there must be no major changes in the Yugoslav regime. Who knew that in the last three days, a major change would actually occur.</p>
<p>This is not to show off to readers that the previous argument was subtly correct. It is certainly not to grasp the inevitability of the realization of the major change. It is only that we have an unshakable belief in our hearts, from which inspiration arises. This belief and inspiration are not unique to us; but because recent world events seem to be everywhere showing madness to the point of having no reason or normality to speak of, the most ordinary beliefs have been obscured, and the usual inspirations have fallen into a state of numbness. What is this belief? It is the consciousness of national self-respect and self-love, as well as the demand for independence and freedom, which are innate and endowed to every enlightened nation; they are hidden in ordinary times, and when it comes to the autumn of danger and survival, the power after their mobilization is unstoppable, and the result after their mobilization is just and successful. The aggressors fundamentally deny that this belief can be established, and Hitler's gains have almost proven the emptiness of this belief; countries like China and Greece, on the contrary, are regarded as almost exceptions. We intellectually believe that this belief will never be erased, even though we have unfortunately witnessed various counter-evidences under Hitler's authority, the belief is still a belief; and the vigorous public opinion and popular indignation in Yugoslavia before the realization of this major change made us, in the moment before witnessing the near collapse of the tide, instinctively and intuitively feel the inspiration that could promote the major change. Now, the major change has actually been realized!</p>
<p>This time, Yugoslavia signed the Axis Pact on the 25th of this month, and Hitler was proudly welcoming his guest Matsuoka, flaunting his diplomatic victory; but he did not expect that Peter II, who was seventeen and a half years old, would reclaim power at one o'clock in the morning on the 27th, implement a new government, and quietly send twenty soldiers to arrest the cabinet members responsible for signing the alliance, completing the so-called "bloodless coup." Then, on the one hand, he issued an edict to appease the people, and on the other hand, he appointed the army leader General Simović to form a new cabinet, and the whole country responded. Thus, in just a few hours, a "vassal of the Axis" who was like a prisoner awaiting trial jumped to become an independent, self-reliant, and promising nation. People who have observed the enthusiastic situation of the Yugoslav people celebrating freedom in the past two days truly feel, as British Prime Minister Churchill said, that this country has found its precious "national soul" again at the last moment. Is this not ironic, that the Axis officials in Berlin, who were elated, and the allied guests who had just unpacked and were receiving courteous treatment, felt that the lamb that was originally at their lips had now turned into an uncontrollable fierce tiger and lion; that they could originally exaggerate victory, but now they had to admit defeat. The Axis front has suffered such a serious blow in diplomacy, the significance and impact of which can be equated with the military setbacks of Italy in Abyssinia and Eritrea, or even surpass them.</p>
<p>Although the success of this major change was surprisingly rapid and seemed abrupt, it was actually very natural to observe its process. As early as when the Cvetković cabinet disregarded the opposition of public opinion and ignored the advice of the United States, Britain, and even the Soviet Union, and insisted on joining the alliance, three cabinet members left in anger, and some city residents protested, all of which were clear signs. According to news from Moscow newspapers, the Yugoslav ruling authorities shot at the crowds who returned home after signing the treaty, and it was expected that this would lead to civil unrest; moreover, British diplomacy, under the personal guidance of Foreign Secretary Eden, never neglected Yugoslavia for a moment; as for the Soviet Union, having already been dissatisfied with Bulgaria's permission for German troops to pass through, it certainly did not want another Slavic country (the Serbian ethnic group belongs to the Slavic race) to follow suit and succumb to Germany; under the circumstances of internal public opinion and external encouragement from friendly countries, the young Yugoslav monarch and the generally sober-minded, freedom-loving military men and politicians emerged, broke free from their shackles, and could this be regarded as unexpected?</p>
<p>It is widely rumored that the new Yugoslav government has declared "independence." Whether it will directly abolish the alliance that was signed less than five days ago is not known at this time, but if Germany still wants to invoke this treaty to infringe upon Yugoslavia's sovereignty and integrity, then in today's situation where the anti-German movement has spread throughout the country and the United States and British governments have successively declared their willingness to provide assistance, it is feared that it will inevitably lead to armed resistance. It is heard that the German government has submitted "urgent documents" to Belgrade, demanding clarification on two points: What is Yugoslavia's attitude towards the Axis powers? What is Yugoslavia's position on the Tripartite Pact? But it is generally speculated that the answers to these two questions will be difficult to satisfy the Axis powers. Regarding the first question, Yugoslavia will certainly declare its willingness to be on friendly terms with all countries, but it must be that others do not offend me, and I do not offend others, otherwise it will not hesitate to fight; regarding the second question, it can only ask Germany to pay attention to the facts that have occurred in Yugoslavia in recent days. Since the old government fell because of the alliance, even if the new government is still prepared to sign some kind of agreement with the Axis powers, it will at least need to change its form and content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after Yugoslavia's awakening, the entire Balkans has been greatly shaken. Some say that Turkey and Yugoslavia will soon establish a mutual assistance pact, and others say that Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece are preparing to consider military cooperation; some even say that the Romanian dictator has issued a statement demanding the revision of the Vienna Agreement on the cession of Transylvania to avoid causing domestic unrest. Therefore, looking ahead, not only may the Balkan Entente be revived, but some Balkan countries that have already yielded may also be affected in the future.</p>
<p>No wonder South African General Smuts said, "Germany has been defeated in the Balkan war by a young child, Peter." This is a very strange 　!</p>
<h3>New Yugoslav Monarch Takes Office; Britain and the United States Send Congratulations</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - The new monarch Peter II was sworn in yesterday. The content of his oath is as follows: "At the beginning of my reign, I solemnly swear before God that I will devote myself to the unity of the nation, the independence of the country, and the integrity of the territory, govern the country in accordance with the Constitution, and always have the welfare of the people in mind. May God help me, Amen." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London - King George VI of England, on the occasion of the accession of the new Yugoslav monarch, sent a telegram to Peter II 　 expressing his congratulations. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram congratulating King Peter II of Yugoslavia, saying that the Yugoslav people are brave and independent people, and sincerely wished for the health of the Yugoslav King and the freedom and independence of Yugoslavia. The telegram also stated, "I hope that the relationship between the United States and Yugoslavia will benefit each other by supporting the principles of freedom and tolerance embraced by the peoples of both countries." (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslav Peter II was sworn into office in front of the Prime Minister and civil and military officials yesterday, and then held a solemn prayer ceremony in the Great Cathedral. When the new King entered and exited the Great Cathedral, the people flocked to watch and celebrate, and the scene was rare. The new monarch smiled and raised his hand to thank the people. Thanksgiving ceremonies were also held in other churches. The previous coup was completed in one hour, and the pre-arrangements were meticulously planned, so the revolution was completed without bloodshed. Peter II personally took power at night 　 o'clock, and then ordered a military officer to lead twenty soldiers directly to Prime Minister 　 Cvetković's official residence, urging the Prime Minister to get up and informing him that he was ordered to arrest him. Other pro-German cabinet members were also treated in the same way and quietly arrested. At the same time, the new Prime Minister Simović summoned former cabinet members who had resigned in opposition to German compromise day and night. At 7:00 in the morning, all radio stations in the capital of Southern China broadcast the King's proclamation. In less than an hour, crowds had gathered outside the embassies of various European countries, expressing their support for democratic countries. Outside the British embassy, crowds held up national flags and sang patriotic songs. The Greek ambassador was even raised over the shoulders by the crowd to show the Yugoslav people's support for the Greek soldiers and civilians 　, while military police were stationed outside the German and Italian embassies to protect them, in case of disturbances. At the same time, people marched through the streets carrying flags, shouting long live the King and the Army, and demanding an alliance with the Soviet Union. In the morning, German tourists suffered minor damage, and in the afternoon, smoke was still coming out of the社址 (unsure on translation of this term, possibly a typo). All the Croats who took office had agreed to cooperate with the new government, but the effectiveness of their cooperation depended on the plan to stop the activities of the Franco faction. The Franco faction is a faction among the Croatian ethnic group that advocates separation. This faction has provided assistance to German Croatian propaganda and often supported the regime that collapsed on Thursday. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Follows a Policy of Independence; Armed Neutrality is Held as a Creed</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia announced yesterday its "independence" and notified Germany, saying that the situation in Yugoslavia could be clearly demonstrated by the facts themselves. Yugoslav troops, under a full mobilization order, marched grandly to the border to resist threats from any side. Well-informed sources said that the German Embassy here had been notified that the situation in Yugoslavia could speak for itself, and that "certain points (i.e., the Tripartite Pact) can only be accepted by the people with the greatest difficulty." The first declaration stated that the Yugoslav government hoped that its neighbors would not encounter difficulties, but that Yugoslavia would henceforth follow a policy of independence. This declaration was issued after a midnight cabinet meeting and a enthusiastic parade yesterday afternoon, when King Peter II and his cabinet members went to church for a thanksgiving service. The people of the capital were given another opportunity during the special thanksgiving service, flocking to the city center, shouting hoarsely. The crowds repeatedly broke through police cordons, surrounded the cars of British and American diplomats, and cheered for Britain, the United States, and Roosevelt. When the cars of Axis nationals passed by, the citizens merely watched in silence. Cars from Poland, Turkey, Greece, and the Soviet Union were also welcomed by the crowds. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - How will Yugoslavia's foreign policy move after the coup? This is a matter of global concern. Well-informed sources here recently commented, "Neutrality" is still Yugoslavia's creed. Although Yugoslavia does not oppose the alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is now attempting to improve relations with Turkey based on the Turkish government's previous proposal of mutual cooperation in important areas of both countries. It can be asserted that General Simović's cabinet has telegraphed the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gavrilović, to return home as soon as possible to be appointed as a minister without portfolio. It is reported that Gavrilović took the road through Hungary last night to return home and will take office as soon as he arrives. According to news from Zagreb, it has not yet been decided whether Maček, the leader of the Croat people, will join the new cabinet. The administrative head of the Cetingrad district, Žeba, has been dispatched to participate in today's cabinet meeting as a stand-in. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Maček's Entry into the Cabinet Undecided; Announcement of Political Views Still Pending</h3>
<p>Belgrade - It was generally expected that the new Yugoslav government would announce its platform this morning, but this did not materialize. It is said that political views cannot be revealed before Dr. Maček, leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, indicates whether or not he will join the cabinet. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Will Not Abandon the Pact; Secret Clauses Not Binding</h3>
<p>London - A special correspondent for the Exchange Telegraph Company stationed in the Swiss capital declared today that officials in the Yugoslav capital said that Yugoslavia would not abandon the published Tripartite Pact. According to officials in Nanjing, the new Yugoslav government has inherited all the obligations of the previous government, so the declaration of Germany and Italy guaranteeing Yugoslavia's sovereignty and integrity should still be considered valid. However, if there are any secret clauses attached to the pact (which seems quite possible), the new government is not bound by them because it does not know their content. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Declares Martial Law; Prevents Outsiders from Causing Disturbances</h3>
<p>Vichy - Vichy News Agency - A dispatch from the capital says that Yugoslavia has declared martial law and issued a notice to the people of the country. When the Yugoslav capital radio station broadcast this news, it urged the people to obey orders to prevent any "foreign elements" from taking the opportunity to cause disturbances. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Order in the Capital Gradually Restored; Former Premier Not Yet Released</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Since last night, order has been completely restored here. Residents are following the advice of the Prime Minister to remain calm and avoid friction with neighboring countries. The troops stationed in various agencies and key areas in the capital have been withdrawn, but there are still a few tanks patrolling the streets. Traffic has returned to normal and shops have reopened. This afternoon, thousands of farmers were seen wandering through the thoroughfares, a different sight from the past, as these people came to the capital from the suburbs to celebrate the young king's accession to the throne.

<h3>British Forces Advance Towards Addis Ababa; 130,000 Italian Troops Surrounded; Indian Troops Establish Great Merit in the Battle of Keren; It is Expected that the East African War Will Soon End</h3>
<p>Cairo - British forces advanced yesterday towards the Addis Ababa (i.e., the capital of Abyssinia) Djibouti railway and Asmara. It is reported that 130,000 troops have been surrounded. It is said that the troops in Harar have retreated in a panic to Dire Dawa (37 miles north of the railway), and it is also planned to evacuate the citizens of Addis Ababa. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Cairo - British military personnel here, who are not prone to making rash statements, recently said that it is not overly optimistic to say that the East African war is expected to end soon. The Battle of Keren was quite large in scale, and that place is a rare and excellent natural fortress in the world. Considering this, the casualties of the British army in the Battle of Keren can be said to be relatively light. Many Indian troops who won this battle, including several famous British infantry divisions, made the greatest contribution. The Palestinian army, the Free French army, the Cape Town motor transport vehicles, and some French Foreign Legion units also contributed. A British military spokesman said that one of the most important impacts of the Battle of Keren was to give the patriotic Abyssinian army a stimulant. These Abyssinian troops will be delighted to hear the news. Thousands of Italian troops were captured in Keren, and the Italian army abandoned a lot of equipment in a panic. The British army took advantage of the victory to advance, and the next target is Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. It is generally believed that the Italian army will not make such a stubborn resistance in Asmara, and there are many Japanese Italians who have taken refuge in Asmara. It is generally believed that Abyssinian Governor-General Aosta must now consider how to deal with the non-combatants in Abyssinia. Regarding the British army's occupation of Harar in Abyssinia, it is expected that Dire Dawa, 25 miles from that place, will also be captured soon. The railway from Dire Dawa to Addis Ababa has been severely bombed by the British Air Force and is no longer of much use. According to the communiqué, when British aircraft recently attacked the railway, a troop train five miles east of Addis Ababa was strafed and damaged. The British Air Force also bombed enemy camps north of Lake Rudolf with great success. When the British army besieged Keren, the British Air Force, the South African Air Force, and the Rhodesian Air Force jointly assisted in the battle, constantly bombarding the position, ignoring enemy anti-aircraft fire, flying as low as fifty yards to drop drinking water, milk, food, and cigarettes to supply the vanguard British army, which made great contributions.

<h3>Asahi Shimbun Implies Japanese Warships Will Assist German Raiding Operations in the Pacific; Tokyo Apparently Acknowledges Matsuoka's German Visit Aims to Counteract the Effect of the US Lend-Lease Act in Aiding Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo - In an editorial, Asahi Shimbun implied the true purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Germany, saying, "How much hope does Germany place on the future work of the Japanese Navy?" Although the Japanese Foreign Minister has repeatedly stated that the trip to Berlin was only for mutual acquaintance, there is still much speculation here about the true purpose of his visit to Germany. Some speculate that when Germany launches its blitzkrieg strategy in the spring, Germany, Italy, and Japan may launch a three-pronged attack at the same time, while others say that Matsuoka may obtain Hitler's peace terms on this trip and entrust the United States to convey them to Britain. There are all kinds of rumors. However, both official and private circles clearly acknowledge that the Foreign Minister's trip aims to find ways to counteract the effect of the US Lend-Lease Act. Therefore, this responsible commentary by Asahi Shimbun can be regarded as a clue to the Axis's plan to counteract American aid to Britain. Since the United States can do its best to aid Britain, why should Japan not follow suit to support the Axis powers? The technical difficulties of transferring Japanese warships to Germany and Italy can be easily solved. German crew members can be transported to ports in North China via Siberia and board the warships that the Japanese Navy can allocate. There is no need to sail to German ports or enter the Atlantic Ocean, because there are many British ships in the Pacific Ocean that can be used as targets for German raids. It is not possible for outsiders to know what kind of warships and how many warships the Japanese Navy can allocate. However, Japan does not need to worry about any sea power's maritime attack. It is believed that a small part of the Japanese fleet is sufficient to cope with possible attacks on the Siberian coast of the Soviet Union. Although the Japanese Navy has important work in the war against China, most of the work it undertakes is auxiliary in nature, because the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast lies in occupying various ports, not in blocking goods transported by sea into China. Although Europe and Asia are far apart, Japan cannot be a backer for Germany and Italy except by threatening the United States. However, the transfer of Japanese warships, even if only used in the East, is also a way to help Germany and Italy, and Japan will not be dragged into the war, because Japan's aid to Germany and Italy is just like the United States' aid to Britain.

<h3>Matsuoka to Convene Diplomatic Envoys Conference in Berlin for Practical Discussions on the European Situation; Difficult to Expect Adjustment in Relations between Japan and the United States and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, upon returning to Berlin from Rome on April 4th, will convene Japanese ambassadors stationed in Germany, Italy, and Turkey, as well as the Chargé d'affaires in France, to hold an "important conference" to discuss the practical European situation. It is said that Matsuoka is scheduled to leave Berlin for Rome by the end of the week. At the same time, careful political observers here believe that while Matsuoka outwardly insists that he does not intend to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, this is actually the purpose of his trip. According to Matsuoka's repeated declarations, his trip is solely for the purpose of seeking better friendship with Hitler, Mussolini, and other Axis leaders, and there is no other purpose. However, observers recall that when the Tripartite Pact was signed, the Soviet Union was not included. At that time, the Japanese government expressed hope that Soviet-Japanese relations could improve through Germany's effective mediation. Observers believe that Matsuoka's discussions, especially those with Hitler, will be nothing more than an attempt to have Germany exert pressure on the Soviet Union to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan. Observers also recall that during the most recent recess of the Japanese Diet, many Diet members suggested that Matsuoka himself travel to Moscow to meet with Stalin to negotiate a non-aggression pact to protect Japan's northern defenses. They believe that this is one way to deal with the increasing pressure from the United States on Japan. Matsuoka should make every effort to address this matter when he passes through Moscow on his way back to Japan. He had already briefly discussed this matter when he was personally received by Stalin in Moscow last week. Observers also stated that Matsuoka has little confidence in concluding a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. This can be seen from his repeated statements that the purpose of his trip is only for "making friends." This trip does not reflect the Japanese government's optimism about improving US-Japanese relations. This can be seen from the Japanese government's deep concern that this trip will hinder US-Japanese relations and obstruct Ambassador Nomura's efforts in Washington. As for the views of Japanese people here on the Foreign Minister, they believe that it is an opportunity for Japan to receive direct European intelligence. This intelligence will be of great benefit to Japan in deciding its future policies. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Matsuoka to Visit Italy Soon</p>
<p>Berlin, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has concluded his visit to Germany and is heading to Italy. According to the German official news agency, Matsuoka met with Ribbentrop again today. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin, General Goering, Minister of Aviation, received Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin, It is rumored that Germany will assist Japan in organizing an East Asian economic system. It is reported that an agreement has been reached in yesterday's meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Matsuoka also investigated Japan's economic relations with German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk and had dinner with Chancellor Hitler. It is widely believed that Matsuoka discussed the position of the United States (with particular emphasis on US aid to Britain) and the general situation in the Far East with Hitler and the German Foreign Minister. It is said that the Chinese resistance and methods to end the Sino-Japanese war were also important points of discussion. It is widely believed that the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations was also raised in the Soviet-Japanese talks, as well as the possibility of a Soviet-Japanese alliance against British and American aid to China. (International News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Attacking the United States in Talks in Germany</p>
<p>Berlin, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka strongly attacked the American newspapers in a conversation with reporters yesterday afternoon, saying that American newspapers actually despise Japan's national power and Japan's determination to fight in China. Matsuoka said that the United States cannot understand Japan and the Japanese people, and therefore underestimates Japan. He also said that the attacks of American newspapers cannot shake the confidence of knowledgeable people outside the United States. He also said, "I dare to announce to the world that Japan can fight in China for ten years or even more without fatigue." When asked to comment on the American newspapers' claim that Japan's strength has been exhausted due to the war in China, Matsuoka replied that it is a mistake for Americans to hold this view. Matsuoka reiterated that Japan will not only not weaken in the future, but will become stronger. Because while Japan is busy with the war in China, it is actually continuing to develop its production. The Japanese Foreign Minister clearly stated that if the United States joins the war, Japan will definitely attack it, but he also said that he has not given up hope of making the Pacific Ocean a peaceful ocean. Matsuoka also pointed out that the construction of the "New Order" in both Europe and East Asia must not be hindered. "I have had this fantasy of a 'New Order' for thirty years," so Japan will fight with full determination to build this "New Order." Regarding the question of his talks with Hitler, Matsuoka refused to comment. When asked if he saw a huge map of Germany in the Chancellor's office when he talked with Hitler, and whether they used this map in their negotiations, Matsuoka smiled and said, "I have a map in my heart." When asked if a Japanese-Soviet agreement could be signed, Matsuoka refused to answer, but he said that when he left Tokyo, he knew that Soviet-Japanese relations were continuing to improve. His talks in Moscow did not change his opinion. Matsuoka finally declared that he has had a dream for many years to place Soviet-Japanese relations on a rock-solid foundation. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Publishes Editorial Advising Matsuoka</p>
<p>The London Daily Telegraph, in its editorial on the revolution in Yugoslavia, offered some advice to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. It said: "Mr. Matsuoka, you have chosen a very interesting time to visit Europe, arriving on the day that a European country recalled its soul. As a wise man, you should realize what is happening. The world has been weary and confused for many years, without expressing itself. The rulers of Germany, Italy, and Japan are vying to expand their territories. This may have been a good idea before 1940, but today the world has leaned up and woken up. What is discovered in one country will quickly spread to all countries. Now that the world has its own opinions, it will expel the dictators who only know how to fight and do not want anything else. The tide has turned, and those who hold guns and want to hold on to them must change direction. The Nazi's public pronouncements on the South were instantly reduced to ashes in the flames of popular anger. In the same week, Britain's lease of naval and air force bases to the United States was signed, and both parties to the agreement are determined that this should be a permanent reality. What is tied to this is not only the safety of those who signed the agreement." (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Board Elections; Rumors of Increasing Number of Seats; Expansion from Fourteen to Eighteen Seats; It Is Said That Relevant Countries Have Not Fully Agreed</h3>
<p>According to news obtained by foreigners yesterday morning, the Municipal Council is currently considering several plans to reallocate the number of seats on the Municipal Council Board. In addition to discussing the proposals put forward by various parties, the Council has also considered changing the method of determining the number of directors. According to a source, one of the plans under consideration by the Council is to increase the number of directors by four, from fourteen to eighteen. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed to this plan. The allocation method is as follows: four each for England, the United States, China, and Japan, one for Germany, and one for a neutral country. Whether this plan or other plans can be implemented depends on whether the relevant countries can unanimously agree. It is said that any such agreement is of a temporary nature. At the same time as this plan, it is said that the Chairman of the Board has two votes. If the votes for or against each director are equally divided at the Council meeting, the Chairman can use his second vote to make a decision. Another feature of this plan is that the Chairman will be either British or American. It is said that the Council hopes to make a decision on this issue before the Council elections.</p>
<p>Rumor That British Candidates Have Been Nominated</p>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" stated that there have been rumors in recent days that the British, American, and Japanese sides in this city are conducting various discussions to change the seats on the Municipal Council Board. However, according to inquiries today (the 29th), the British community has already nominated five British director candidates. Therefore, the outcome of this year's Council Board elections is still uncertain. It is said that the five candidates for the British directors are the current British directors Casevitz (Chairman of the Municipal Council), Powell, Hiley, Mitchell, and McDonald. However, an official of the Municipal Council refused to disclose the names of the British directors who have been nominated this morning. It is said that there may be changes to the nominated candidates, so the Bureau is inconvenient to disclose their names until the nomination period has expired.</p>
<p>Agenda of Taxpayers' Meeting Announced</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the following proposals will be submitted for discussion at the annual meeting of taxpayers to be held on April 17 at the Public Stand of the Racecourse: (A special meeting of taxpayers convened by the Bureau will be held at 2:30 pm on the same day before the annual meeting.) (1) To elect Judge Hallimick as Chairman of the meeting; (2) To elect Mr. Bethslay as Secretary of the meeting; (3) The effective rules of procedure of the previous annual meeting will be used this year and will remain in effect until the next annual meeting; (4) To elect Mr. Ashbek as the Land Committee member for the next year; (5) To elect Mr. Hellay, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Boerrensen, and Dr. Mingside as Directors of the Public Hospital; (6) To approve the Municipal Council's report and accounts for 1940; (7) To approve the Municipal Council's budget for 1941, together with all its recommendations, and to authorize the Bureau to collect and supplement the proposed taxes and fees. Furthermore, if deemed appropriate, to approve the Bureau to raise an amount not exceeding 9 million yuan or the equivalent thereof, to cover the various items specified in the temporary budget.</p>
<p>Special Meeting to Ratify Changes to Board</p>
<p>According to the "New Voice News Agency", as announced by the Municipal Council yesterday, a special meeting of taxpayers will be held at 2:00 pm on April 17, before the annual taxpayers' meeting. Although the agenda of the special meeting has not been announced, sources revealed that the important agenda of the special meeting may be related to the change in the number of directors on the Board. In other words, the reorganization of the Municipal Council Board will be recognized by the special meeting, and then the usual annual meeting of Western taxpayers will proceed. In addition, when the special meeting of foreign taxpayers was held on February 5 this year, Chairman Casevitz announced the formation of a tax system research committee to resolve the tax system issue. It is now said that the committee has ceased its work, and it is expected that the report and opinions it drafted will be submitted to the special meeting for discussion on April 17 to end the tax collection issue within the concession. In general, the special meeting on April 17 will be very short, probably less than an hour, and will be completed. In fact, this special meeting is nothing more than a prelude to the taxpayers' annual meeting, and its significance is far less important than the last special meeting.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Factory Labor Strike Resolved Late Last Night</h3>
<p>After the workers of the coal ball factory in this city went on strike, the labor and management sides directly negotiated yesterday afternoon. The management side agreed to three principles in principle: (1) The monthly salary of coal ball makers will be increased by 15 yuan to 39 yuan; (2) The salary of truck workers will be increased by 11.1 yuan to 56 yuan per month; (3) The subsidy for tricycle and "tiger car" delivery workers will remain at 6 cents per load, with an additional 1.5 dou of rice subsidy per person, priced at 50 yuan per stone. The workers' representatives immediately conveyed this to all the workers. After obtaining their consent, the negotiations were resolved at 10 pm last night. Starting today, the six major coal ball factories of Yitai Hing, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, Huatong, and Jinghua will resume work.</p>
<h3>Dr. Vida of the Paris School of Psychotherapy Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The French-language "Shanghai Daily" reported that Dr. Vida, a famous psychotherapist from Paris, is traveling around the world, spreading psychotherapy, and has now arrived in Shanghai and is staying at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs; The City was Solemn and Respectful; All Circles Encouraged Each Other to Be More Loyal and Steadfast</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, which was designated by the Central Government as the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day (including the martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan, the martyrdom of Chen Ying Shi, the martyrdom of Liao Zhongkai, the martyrdom of Zhu Zhixin, the death of Huang Keqiang, and the death of Hu Hanmin. All commemorative days will be held together). All sectors of the population in this city followed the regulations of the National Government and, under the leadership of the City Party Department, expressed their respect for the great achievements of the martyrs by lowering the flag to half-mast, suspending entertainment banquets, and making solemn commemorations. Because of the special environment of Shanghai, no large-scale ceremonies were held. On the one hand, the campaign of saving the country through frugality was promoted spontaneously, and on the other hand, the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country was firmly supported. Therefore, yesterday, the entire city, in the atmosphere of drizzle, showed an even more solemn and respectful scene. The people's hearts were inspired, and they deeply believed that the final victory was just around the corner. In addition, yesterday, a large number of patriotic leaflets were found on various roads in this city, such as Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Joffre, Bubbling Well Road, Nanking Road, and Avenue Lafayette, all of which were posted on utility poles and walls.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Authorities Will Make Every Effort to Obtain Rice Transport Vessels; Joint Distribution of Arriving Rice by the Two Concessions; More Than 200 Rice Shops Demand Guarantees</h3>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the Municipal Council has announced that it will soon set up a subcommittee to charter vessels to transport 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice per month from Rangoon to Shanghai until the situation improves. As for the French Concession, an official of the Municipal Council stated that although the Bureau would not directly participate in the chartering of vessels, it has expressed its willingness to cooperate fully with the Municipal Council to cope with the general rice situation. It is said that the French Concession authorities will do their utmost to obtain vessels controlled by the French government to transport rice from Vietnam to this city. When the rice arrives, the two Bureaus will cooperate in its distribution.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Demand</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Wan Yuan Rice Shop on Shanxi Road being charged with exceeding the price limit and sentenced to imprisonment the day before yesterday, the rice shops throughout the city believe that there is no guarantee for their business. Yesterday afternoon, more than 200 businesses went to the guild to ask for instructions and demand guarantees. A member of the guild instructed them to wait for the authorities to resolve the matter fairly before they dispersed.</p>
<p>Warehouse Inventory</p>
<p>According to the list reported by the Bean and Rice Industry Guild on the 26th of this month to the Municipal Council, as of the same date, the total inventory of rice in the warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, and the two concessions south of the Suzhou Creek was 841,275 bags, an increase of 38,370 bags compared to the report one week earlier.</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Demands Payment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Rice Public Warehouse Committee, since resolving to order the first batch of 80,000 bags of warehouse rice, has been contacted by the responsible persons of the committee in all directions to negotiate prices. It is now heard that the contract has been completely finalized and signed with Jie Fu Foreign Company. The batch of warehouse rice is expected to be shipped from Rangoon and arrive in Shanghai in mid-May. As for the collection of funds for the purchase of warehouse rice from various industries, the five gold industry has remitted 11,542.5 yuan, the spinning mill industry has remitted 30,000 yuan, and the bean and grain industry has remitted 86,175 yuan, totaling 6,774,605 yuan including the previous collections. However, among the bean and grain industry, the Guangbang Shenshou Hall was supposed to allocate 2,500 bags, but only promised to undertake 745 bags and paid for 425 bags. The Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Industry was supposed to allocate 2,500 bags, but only promised 1,000 bags and has not yet paid. In addition, the rice industry and the Quanzhang Guild have not made any firm commitments. A letter has been sent to them urging them to raise the full amount as originally allocated and pay it immediately to avoid delays.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Electricity Reduction Will Be Changed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the lack of fuel, previously obtained the consent of the Municipal Council to announce that all users whose electricity consumption exceeds 1,000 degrees per month must reduce it by 30 percent. Although this method has been implemented, it is not scientific, and it is particularly preferential to Japanese businesses while it strikes at Chinese businesses.</p>
<p>Also Unfair</p>
<p>Therefore, the company specially invited experts from China, England, and Japan to form a special committee to study the fairest and most appropriate method. After several weeks of detailed discussion of various reports on the electricity consumption of users throughout the city, the committee has divided all users in the city into ten categories. Among them, in addition to various undertakings related to social security, it has been decided to temporarily not restrict their needs. It is said that the supply methods for the remaining categories have also been largely</p>
<p>Drafted Completely</p>
<p>Therefore, the task of the committee will be completed in the shortest possible time. As for the general amount of electricity reduction, it is heard that it may be more than the announced 30 percent. However, the details have not been released. After the new proposed method is fully completed, it will be approved by the Municipal Council and implemented. At that time, the temporary method of electricity reduction will be announced.</p>
<h3>South China Route; British Ships Increase Fares; Increase of 10 to 15 Percent; Fares from South China to Shanghai to be Determined Separately</h3>
<p>Since the loss of the various ports along the Yangtze River in China, the Yangtze River routes of third countries have been tacitly abandoned. Although the North and South China routes of British merchants have also been severely hit, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire are still trying to maintain them. Business on the North China route is slightly inferior, while transportation on the South China route is more prosperous than before. Due to the sharp reduction in foreign exchange, freight rates have been changed from Chinese currency to Hong Kong dollars, and they have been increased again and again. The prices of ship tickets have also risen again and again, still calculated in Chinese currency. It has been found that the ticket prices were recently increased starting from November 1st of last year. It has only been four months since then, and the two companies have suddenly decided to increase them again, to be implemented starting on the 7th of the month (April) (Monday). The new price list is recorded below.</p>
<p>South China Route</p>
<p>Shanghai to Wenzhou: First class (i.e., official cabin) 55 yuan, second class (i.e., room cabin) 45 yuan, third class (i.e., hammock) 35 yuan, fourth class (i.e., steerage) 20 yuan. To Fuzhou: First class 65 yuan, second class 50 yuan, third class 40 yuan, fourth class 28 yuan. To Xiamen: First class 85 yuan, second class 55 yuan, third class 45 yuan, fourth class 35 yuan. To Shantou: First class 90 yuan, second class 65 yuan, third class 50 yuan, fourth class 35 yuan. To Hong Kong: First class 110 yuan, second class 85 yuan, third class 65 yuan, fourth class 45 yuan. Although there are no direct British ships to Guangzhou, the price is calculated as usual: First class 120 yuan, second class 100 yuan, third class 72 yuan, fourth class 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Fang Line</p>
<p>That is, Shanghai to Haiphong, via Haikou. Haikou was once closed due to military relations. Recently, Butterfield &amp; Swire's ships have been able to stop there once every two weeks. Beihai is still closed. Passenger ticket prices are still regulated. Shanghai to Haikou: First class 145 yuan, second class 110 yuan, third class 80 yuan, fourth class 55 yuan. To Beihai: First class 165 yuan, second class 135 yuan, third class 90 yuan, fourth class 65 yuan. To Haiphong: First class 220 yuan, second class 165 yuan, third class 110 yuan, fourth class 85 yuan. Haiphong is in French Vietnam, and a tax must be paid to enter the country. The tax amount is 8 yuan for first class, 4 yuan for second class, and 2 yuan for third and fourth class. It has been found that the above</p>
<p>New Ticket Prices</p>
<p>Are 10 to 15 percent higher than the old ticket prices. The fares from South China to Shanghai are different. The entry procedures for passengers traveling to Hong Kong and Haiphong remain the same and have not changed. This point must be noted. The old prices are not raised.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Discounts for Large Volume Gas Users</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, the Bureau has approved the Shanghai Gas Company to abolish the discount payment method for large volume gas users. From now on, the gas costs for all users will be collected according to the current charging rate, that is, 3 cents per ten cubic feet, plus a surcharge.</p>
<p>When the Bureau approved the increase of the surcharge proposed by the Mulla Fire Company to 250 percent in the first month of this year, it considered several items regarding the proposed changes to the conditions of supply. The purpose of the above-mentioned amendments is to limit the consumption of gas, because the greater the consumption of gas, the greater the need for coal and fuel oil. The Bureau also studied the company's charging situation and concluded that it is unfair to ordinary household users if large users still enjoy the benefits of discounts as usual. Therefore, the discount method should be abolished and allowed to be implemented from the time users use gas after the next meter reading.</p>
<h3>Boy Kidnapped; Son of Manager of Guangqin Textile Company; Rescued Home Only to be Kidnapped Again</h3>
<p>The son of Mr. Yang, manager of Guangqin Textile Company in West Shanghai, named Zifang, is 11 years old and is from Wuxi. He is studying at a certain school. At about 5:30 pm on the day before yesterday (the 28th), he was returning to his residence after school, riding in his own chartered car passing through the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, when he suddenly encountered two kidnappers. One of them was armed with a gun, stopped the chartered car, and threatened him. As a result, the boy Yang Zifang was forcibly dragged out of the chartered car and taken to a Yunfei car parked on the side of the road, which sped away, and his whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the chartered car driver returned to the residence to report the kidnapping of his young master and reported to the Gordon Road Police Station to request arrest.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning Three Telegraph Bureaus; Messengers Go On Strike</h3>
<p>More than a hundred messengers hired by the foreign merchants of Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Telegraph Bureaus in this port have asked to improve their treatment due to the high cost of living and have submitted five demands to the authorities to maintain their livelihood. After several days, their request has not been granted, so they went on strike starting at 11:30 am yesterday. It is heard that the telegraph authorities will give a concrete response tomorrow (Monday). During the strike, the messengers will not deliver telegrams. If merchants and civilians expect telegrams to arrive in Shanghai, they can go to the bureaus to inquire at any time.</p>
<h3>Famous Female Writer Xie Bingxin in Chongqing: Rumors of Her Death in Yunnan Untrue; Ba Jin's Recent Letter Describes Her Current Condition</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping on the 27th, Xie Bingxin, a professor at the Southwest Associated University and a famous female writer, recently passed away in Kunming due to a lung ailment. Xie is one of the earliest renowned female writers since China's May Fourth Movement. Her works, such as the early novel "Superman" and poetry collection "Stars," and later essays such as "To Young Readers," have a wide readership. She was even elected as a member of the National Political Council this year. News of her death caused shock and concern among various circles, especially in cultural circles. However, some people wondered why, if Xie passed away in Kunming, the news originated from Peiping. Therefore, this reporter visited Xie's literary friends in Shanghai, but none of them had heard of this. Xie's sister-in-law, who currently resides in Shanghai, also stated that it was absolutely untrue, confirming that the Peiping dispatch was a groundless rumor. According to writer Xu Diaofu, who is close to Xie, Xie's whereabouts are actually in Chongqing, not Kunming. She is currently in Chongqing with her husband, Wu Wenzao (a famous Chinese professor), participating in the National Political Council. Furthermore, he had received a letter from the writer Ba Jin, currently in Sichuan, dated March 13, which mentioned Xie's recent situation, but did not mention any lung ailment. This proves that the aforementioned rumor is untrue. Xu already sent a letter to Chongqing yesterday to inquire about the situation, and it is expected that Xie will soon send a reply to Shanghai, which should clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Central Bank and Farmers Bank to Resume Operations on the 1st; Jiangsu Farmers Bank to Resume Operations Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources: (1) The Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at 539 Avenue Joffre and its exchange office at 282, announced yesterday that they will resume operations tomorrow. (2) The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at 439 Avenue Albert and its office on Route des Soeurs officially announced yesterday that after repairs, the two branches are roughly ready and will resume operations on April 1st. (3) The Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank at 67 Avenue Joffre and its office on Avenue Haig were contacted by telephone by a reporter from the Central News Agency. It was said that the bank's resumption of operations would be on the same day as the Central Bank, on April 1st.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Under Special Alert Since Last Night; To Be Lifted at 8 PM Tonight</h3>
<p>It was widely rumored in Shanghai yesterday that the two concessions would implement special martial law starting at 8 PM last night, leading the general public to believe that martial law would be implemented earlier. In fact, the police departments of the two concessions, due to yesterday being the Memorial Day for the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs and today being the Anniversary of the National Government's Return to Nanjing, feared that unscrupulous elements would take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, it was decided to implement an emergency alert starting last night. In addition to deploying more detectives to patrol and search, non-essential locations on various roads were temporarily sealed off. Dance halls closed early last night. Today, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French Defense Forces of the French Concession will be fully mobilized for security. This special temporary alert will be lifted at 8 PM tonight. However, the curfew hours will remain the same as before.</p>

<h3>Assassin of Wang Yanqin, Du Hongbin, Commits Suicide: After the Incident, He Lodged in a Small Inn Under an Assumed Name; With Nowhere to Turn, He Drank Poison</h3>
<p>Wang Yanqin, the second adopted daughter of the famous Shanghai opera singer Wang Xiaoxin, was twenty years old this year and also a famous Shanghai opera actress. She fell in love with Du Hongbin (twenty-two years old this year), a student of Liu Ziyun, a colleague in the same troupe and from Pudong. They made a vow of love and took a commemorative photo with intertwined arms. They even received the consent of Wang Xiaoxin and his wife, who allowed Yanqin to marry Du Hongbin. However, recently, Yanqin's sister-in-law, Wang Yaqin, fell ill and was invited to the Shanghai Opera Troupe (i.e., the Queen's Theater) to perform in her place, suddenly developing a heart for</p>
<p>Abandoning the Old and Loving the New.</p>
<p>She fell in love with another person, forming a love triangle, and disregarded Du. Du requested a formal engagement with Yanqin, but was firmly rejected. She even cut up the photos they had taken together and returned them to Du, indicating her determination to break up. Du, heartbroken and resentful, harbored the thought of killing her to vent his anger. At 6 PM on the 23rd of this month, Yanqin was walking from the Shanghai Opera Troupe back to her residence in the Ju'an Lane, on Rue Marco Polo, when she passed the Great World and was</p>
<p>Lured into</p>
<p>the Great World Open-Air Cinema. Du suddenly produced a sharp blade and stabbed Yanqin in the throat, causing her death. Du fled after the incident, and the French Concession Police issued an arrest warrant. The details have already been reported in this newspaper, and the incident caused a sensation in Shanghai. Du Hongbin, after the incident, fled east and hid everywhere, knowing that he would have to pay for murder with his life and could not escape the law. He then conceived the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 27th, he</p>
<p>Bought Poison</p>
<p>and sneaked into the Ronghua Small Inn at 146 Avenue des Soeurs, opposite the Franco-Chinese School, under the assumed name of opening room number 20 on the pretext of borrowing a place to stay. He committed suicide by taking poison. At 9 PM that night, he was poisoned, and the tea boy discovered it and reported it to the police. He was sent to the Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save him. He died at noon the next day. Later, the detectives found his pass and photo on his person and realized that he was the culprit who killed Wang Yanqin. They notified Wang Xiaoxin and Liu Ziyun to identify him.</p>
<p>It was confirmed that it was indeed him. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. However, the deceased had no family members. His parents had died early, and his aunt had sent Du to Liu Ziyun to learn Shanghai opera. It is unknown who will claim his body for burial, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Tao Guangchuan Still in Custody; Family Visited</h3>
<p>Tao Guangchuan, principal of the Lequn Middle School at 970 Avenue Haig, was suddenly taken away from his office at the school yesterday afternoon by four foreigners, together with police officers. He is currently detained at the Central Police Station. When the foreigners and police officers arrived, they monitored the actions of all teachers and staff and conducted a thorough search of the school, but found nothing. Tao's family, upon hearing the news, went to the police station twice that night to visit him, and again yesterday morning. They found Tao to be quite comfortable. Tao is the founder of the school and is usually enthusiastic about education, with no other activities. His arrest may be due to a misunderstanding, and it is expected that he will be released soon.</p>

<h3>After Jack La Lai's Arrest, the U.S. Court Will Continue the Trial; Possible Sentence of Eighty-Five Years; After the Sentence is Final, He Will Be Sent Back to the United States for Trial</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Jack La Lai, the "Slot Machine King" of Shanghai, who fled last year to escape justice, was arrested in Hongkou yesterday (the 28th) and detained in the Ward Road Jail. The U.S. Court is preparing to resume the trial next week. Attorney Rogers will defend La Lai. U.S. Court officials stated this morning (the 29th) that La Lai will not be charged with new crimes for jumping bail. However, La Lai has already been charged with operating gambling, and if the investigation is true, he could be sentenced to eighty-five years. It is expected that after La Lai's trial in Shanghai is completed, he will be sent back to Oklahoma, USA, for trial, as he was sentenced to twenty-five years for theft in that state in 1925 and then escaped from prison.</p>
<h3>Culture on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The Avenue Joffre Cinema is the only paradise for the children nearby. This cinema is built in the style of the Cathay Cinema. It has no balcony, is quite spacious, and the seats are very comfortable. It does not have the dirty and noisy atmosphere of other small cinemas. The films shown are all first-class American films, and most of them have been shown at the Grand Cathay. Occasionally, one or two Chinese films are also shown. Therefore, the audience who want to see movies do not need to go to the Grand Cathay to buy those expensive seats, but wait for them to be shown at the Avenue Joffre. What difference does it make to see them later or earlier? Although the ticket prices at the Avenue Joffre have also risen to fifty cents and seventy cents recently, they are still cheaper than those at the Grand Cathay after all. Every Saturday afternoon and Sunday, the entrance of the cinema is often crowded with countless spectators, with children making up the majority, waiting for the audience inside to leave the venue, and scrambling to rush in to grab the better seats. Because every movie is always so crowded, and the children always skillfully rush to grab seats regardless of everything, the adults are embarrassed to compete with them and have to fall behind.</p>
<p>Because groups of students come and go on this road from morning to night, the business of the Avenue Joffre Cinema is so prosperous, so the nearby shops have also doubled their profits. In the past year, stationery stores, second-hand bookstores, and small bookstalls have been continuously added. Because book prices have risen, most middle school students come here to search for the old textbooks they need. There are five or six second-hand bookstalls here, and there is also a one-room second-hand bookstore that often posts advertisements in the newspapers soliciting basic readers who enjoy reading novels. It is the main base for second-hand books on this road, especially all kinds of new and old novels. The textbooks have the best business on the second-hand bookstalls. These bookstalls are all loaded with books displayed on the roadside using soap boxes. There is also a bookstore that has a particularly large collection of thread-bound, stone-printed, and woodblock-printed ancient books, so its customers are all old gentlemen with glasses and handlebar mustaches. One of the bookstalls is quite large in scale, and most of its customers are students. Whenever the stall owner has something to do or encounters rainy weather, he always hangs a sign on the wall of the stall base, stating that the "bookstore" is closed today due to business or rain, which seems to be a way to attract customers. There is also a bookstall that specializes in selling novels and notebooks that were previously known as 20% discount books. These books are now printed with colorful covers, and the prices are also much more expensive. There is also a branch of the Qiming Bookstore. Qiming rose up with the prosperity of 20% discount books. It initially edited modern creations and sold them at the lowest prices, similar to 20% discount prices, to facilitate the general readers. Now, it mainly focuses on re-translations of world famous works. In addition, it has also compiled and printed many dictionaries, and its business is very developed. In addition, there is also a newspaper and magazine stall. I was initially a regular customer of this newspaper stall, and I got very familiar with the young stall owner. I also wrote a special feature about him. His initial scale was very small, with only a few kinds of newspapers of various sizes. Now, there are all kinds of newspapers and magazines, such as travel magazines, "Tianxia Shi," "West Wind," "Liangyou," and various movie pictorials and songbooks. The young stall owner is a person who lost his job after the war and is self-reliant. I see his newspaper stall gradually expanding and prospering every day, and I often secretly rejoice for him and bless him. (To be continued)</p>

The assailant immediately fled without a trace. After the incident, the situation in Nanshi was very tense. There was a strict search, and all the iron gates to the concessions were closed.</p>

<h3>Grains: Ships Will Be Allocated to Transport Burmese Rice Exclusively; Small Grains Rice Plummets; Another Sixty to Seventy Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice and Corn Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice have been imported in recent days, which is considerable. As reported in this newspaper, the Java Company's Zesarea arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 28th), bringing a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong. According to the company yesterday, what was brought was not foreign rice, but corn (i.e., pearl rice) 4,500 tons, totaling more than 45,000 bags, also produced in Vietnam and transshipped through Hong Kong. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Tai Sheng arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong with 14,524 bags of foreign rice and 470 bags of corn. Also, the Fusheng arrived at the port yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong with 11,876 bags of foreign rice. Both ships were docked at the Roosevelt Wharf and began unloading yesterday. (Zu)</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice began to fall yesterday, with prices declining uniformly across all grades. The decline was especially significant for small grains rice. The opening price for small grains rice was already following the weak trend of the previous night, and the selling pressure was very strong. The speculators were afraid of the Municipal Council cracking down on excessive price increases and punishing three rice shops including Wan Yuan Rice Shop, and therefore did not dare to openly manipulate the market. Although囤戶 tried to buy at low prices, the brokers who were accomplices were watching the situation. The market eased significantly. The key factor was the rumor that the Municipal Council would allocate ships to transport small grains rice from Yangon to Shanghai, which undermined the rice merchants' excuse for high prices due to transportation problems. Therefore, the decline was greatest for small grains rice. From this, it can be seen that only facts can control facts. As long as the rice market is slightly regulated, it can be guaranteed that the price of rice will not reach today's level. It is still hoped that the Municipal Council will take further effective measures. This is fortunate for the people's livelihood. Yesterday, the opening price for small grains rice fell by 4,000 yuan, then decreased from 3,800 yuan to 3,600 yuan. No. 1 fell from 3,300 yuan to 3,100 yuan, No. 2 from 3,500 yuan to 3,300 yuan, and broken rice to 2,500-2,600 yuan, all down by 200-400 yuan compared to the previous night. Compared to the high prices of the previous day, the drop was as much as 400-600 yuan. Only 6,000-7,000 bags were traded throughout the day, because Japanese merchants stopped and囤戶 were watching. Local real sales were light.</p>
<p>Due to the source of thick and thin粳 and other national rice being rare due to the wind and rain, the sales in stores were still sluggish. In addition, with the falling price of foreign rice, the sellers were unable to reverse the situation, and prices fell by one or two yuan. The opening price for special粳 was 120-123 yuan per斛,昆山粳 from 111-118 yuan, and Qingjiao薄稻 112-113 yuan. Original packages still lacked trading.</p>
<p>Because there was little market货 for glutinous rice, and the inventory was limited, sellers had no intention of selling it cheaply, so although the market was not smooth, the market was still勉定. The prices opened were similar to before. Hong Kong white yuan was still high from 108 yuan to 102-103 yuan, glutinous 菉 from 97 yuan, and broken rice 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Mediocre</h3>

<h3>Gold Market: Many Twists and Turns, but Little Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the烚赤 black market was still 平疲. It hovered around 6,500 yuan all day. Originally, because the exchange market continued to harden, people's hearts were scattered and listless, and the price was difficult to rise. In the early morning, it once saw a low of 6,475 yuan. In the middle, Hengji, Chengji, and Tianyuan put forth the 力, and luckily Dafeng, Xinfeng, Yong, and others covered shorts, and Deda also bought, so it could rise to 6,518 yuan. Although it fell into the 6,500 yuan level again later, the closing price relied on Hengji pulling it up, so it still had 6,508 yuan, resulting in another drop of 28 yuan. Trading was still旺, calculated at 14,000 taels. To change the period from March to April, initially Xianghe貼 into more than 45 yuan, and做開 170 taels.

The market was slightly chaotic, retreated to 6,490 yuan, and then raised to 6,510 yuan. Hengji, Chengji, 犬元 and Yili came to sell, and it was said that the 沪西帮 also came out. Step down 35 yuan to 6,475 yuan. After 9:30, Xinfeng, Yong, Dasheng and remittance dealers bought in, and Yida also bought.

Hengji复进, and Shunyuan also bought, and when the scattered shorts were补建, it was raised again to 6,510 yuan. It closed at 正上 6,508 yuan, 28 yuan less than the closing price of the previous day.

<h3>Bank Reserve Committee Reduces Clearing Rate; Effective April 1st; No Interest Paid Beyond the Fixed Amount</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Reserve Committee sent a letter to each bank yesterday, stating that due to the international situation in Shanghai, the liquidity has increased, and the committee's exchange deposits and interbank deposits have increased, resulting in a significant loss of interest. After consultation with the China Central Bank, the clearing deposit interest rate will be determined according to each bank's usual needs for payment of bills and average deposit situation, and the deposit interest limit will be determined separately. The balance within the limit will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 1.5% for exchange bank deposits, and other interbank deposits will be calculated at an annual interest rate of 1.25%. No interest will be paid on amounts exceeding the limit. It will be effective from April 1st. It is said that the limit of each bank varies, and is stipulated by the committee separately, ranging from several million yuan to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>The bank reserve committee's clearing deposit interest rate was originally a uniform 3%. Since November 1st last year, the exchange bank deposit has been reduced by 1%, and the改 has been changed to 2%. The interbank deposit outside the exchange bank has been reduced by 1.25%, and the改 has been changed to 1.75%. At that time, each commercial bank had the reason for borrowing the interest reduction of the committee, and implemented the reduction of floating interest. Now the interest rate of current deposits of each bank is only 2-3% per annum. If each bank continues to reduce the deposit interest, it will inevitably promote depositors to use their齊 for other purposes, or it will be used by the bank. One of the two must be the case. At present, many banks have various restrictions outside of the regulations, and each time the change is made, how do they know that there will not be a day when they turn to charge depositors a保管 fee? As each bank is 于效举, it is feared that it will not be avoided. (公)</p>
<h3>Securities - Someone Specially Collects Type Xu</h3>
<p>Public and off-market trading: Yesterday's market conditions showed a slightly firm trend overall. Type Xu was the most popular, mainly because Shunchang Trading Company has been specially collecting Type Xu for several days, taking in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands each day. This has invisibly driven up the market price. Type Bing usually has many bulls due to its lottery drawing on April 10th. Because there are too many bulls, people are selling at high prices, preventing the price from rising. The rest just fluctuated. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one session in the morning. Shunchang continued to buy. Others like Xinfu, Tongkang, and Xinhua, although not in large quantities, still consistently bought. Shunheng, Lianyi, and Zhongyi all showed interest. There were more bulls selling off from Lianhe. Datong, Dazhong, Delong, and Wuhe all had sell orders. As a result, most prices rose slightly by five cents, one dime, to three dimes and a half. Type Bing rose slightly by five cents. The total transaction volume was about one million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>Stock Transactions |  |  |  |</p>
<p>Stock Transactions - 200 shares of Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange stocks were traded at a price of 32 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

It was resolved to increase the total capital from 3 million yuan in national currency to 6 million yuan in national currency.

<h3>Yarn and Flower - Bulls and Bears at a Stalemate - The Yarn Market Hovers</h3>
<p>The yarn market has returned to a hovering course, but the contention between bulls and bears remains fierce. Therefore, it is very hesitant, but the actual sales are very dull. Today, the Hong Kong group only had ten bales traded. The rest is entirely a bouncing ball business, everyone kicking it around, which is very lively, but there is absolutely no brilliance. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,394 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,384 yuan. In the afternoon, it was silent due to the weekend. The current yarn market is waiting for new changes before making any major moves up or down. The bulls are looking up because of the high prices of all goods, and the bears are looking down because of narrow sales and sea transportation, with increasing inventory and loans.</p>
<p>Bian Ma (changed horse) opened in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day. The opening price was 1,389 yuan. After a short while, it rose slightly to 1,388.5 yuan. News then came that gold prices had opened lower, and confidence weakened slightly. Sellers became active, and the price fell to 1,385 yuan. However, once the low price was seen, it did not go any lower, and there was a rebound. Profit-takers and new bulls became active, and the price rose to 1,394 yuan. However, due to poor actual yarn trading, it fell back to 1,392 yuan at the close. It is found that the total transaction volume during the day was 6,010 bales. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 10 bales</p>
<p>Other Firms: 6,000 bales</p>
<p>Total: 6,010 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market - Manufacturers Waiting and Watching</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market was flat and unremarkable, but prices remained firm and high. This is because the inventory in Shanghai is decreasing daily, and it is also quite difficult for foreign cotton to arrive at the port. Types such as American upland cotton are highly valued by the public. Manufacturers are not actively purchasing, and due to the Saturday situation, a total of 550 bales of foreign cotton and 1,036 bales of Chinese cotton were traded. The price increased by one yuan, resulting in less enthusiastic trading. The trading prices for yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hui Shi Deng: 290.0, 100 bales from the same industry</p>
<p>Huo Ji Hua: 192.5, Also, 134 bales</p>
<p>Huo Cao Bao: 197.0, Also, 152 bales</p>
<p>Peng Jia Po: 279.0, Also, 100 bales</p>
<p>Also: 281.0, Also, 10 bales</p>
<p>Also, High Grade: 290.0, Also, 100 bales</p>
<p>Tai Cang Cao: 207.0, Also, 150 bales</p>
<p>Also: 30.0, Also, 600 bales</p>
<p>Mei Mi De Lin: 390.0, Also, 150 bales</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose initially due to large-scale buying and news from Washington that the Department of Agriculture Committee had approved cotton and wheat loans. However, it later fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day by sixteen or seventeen pounds.</p>
<p>Also, on the same day, a telegram from New York stated that the statistics from August 1 of last year to February 28 of this year are recorded below (per bale of 500 pounds):</p>
<p>Total listed: 9,681,000 bales</p>
<p>Cotton used by yarn factories: 6,798,000 bales</p>
<p>Total exports: 796,000 bales</p>
<p>To Japan: 78,000 bales</p>
<p>To China: 30,100 bales</p>
<p>To England: 338,000 bales</p>
<p>To Germany: 39,100 bales</p>
<p>Current inventory: 6,43,000 bales</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose in the morning due to strong support from major players, then fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales. Later, it rose again due to speculative buying, and then fell again due to public liquidation and weak stocks. Yesterday's closing price fell by three to six rupees. It is also predicted that the opening price today will still be firm, with a rise of two and a half rupees expected.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is still in a state of hesitant progress. Most factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude and are not interested in purchasing, but the market is still relatively firm and tending to advance.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - The Rising Trend of Sugar is Getting Stronger</h3>
<p>According to a Dutch telegram yesterday, the price of Dutch Red Long sugar was US$2.85. According to C.I.F. practice, the rising trend of crude white sugar is gaining momentum due to the continued absorption by new hoarders. According to the association's trading, the initial price of Grade 24 crude white sugar was 88 yuan to 87.8 yuan, then rose to 88.5 yuan to 89 yuan, an increase of 1.8 yuan. The price for April 10 delivery was 88.2 yuan to 88.5 yuan, then rose to 89 yuan, 89.5 yuan, and 89.4 yuan. The price for April 20 delivery was 88.8 yuan, 89 yuan, and 89.5 yuan, then further rose to 90 yuan, 90.05 yuan, and 90.3 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Dutch Red sugar was 68.8 yuan to 69 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Taikoo Refined White B Mark was 89 yuan to 90 yuan, an increase of 1.4 yuan. DY Mark was 84.5 yuan to 85.5 yuan, an increase of 1.1 yuan. HX Mark was 83.8 yuan to 84.5 yuan. This Grade 1 ice sugar was 114 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar was 115 yuan, both up 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal - Hai Feng Coal on the Black Market - Increased by Another 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>The shortage of white coal is becoming increasingly acute. The reason for this is still the large-scale hoarding by industry insiders who are holding back from selling. The listed price is only nominal, and shopkeepers have to search for warehouse receipts at high prices to meet market demand. As a result, the black market price is rising step by step. Yesterday, the old warehouse receipt for Hai Feng white coal opened at 350 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan. The price for delivering screened lumps to customers from the street door shop was 368 yuan per ton, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals - Tin Ingots and Steel Bars Are Both Rising</h3>
<p>Tin Ingots: The market price of 99.9% pure tin ingots has also risen sharply along with the rapid rise in the price of various standard goods. Yesterday, the market price was already calling for 5,000 yuan, and there was no spot available for wholesale. It is found that the sources of this product in Singapore and Hong Kong have long been cut off. Only the inventory on this street can meet the market demand. Therefore, the industry is in high spirits, and market prices are rising steadily.</p>
<p>Steel Bars: Although the construction industry is slow to take interest in the trading of ribbed steel bars and the customer uptake is limited, the holders of the goods are still thinking high because of the lack of goods on the market and the lack of incoming supplies. The standard market price is rising rather than falling. The reason for this is that, in addition to the hoarders actively buying, the intention of the holders to hoard for profit should also be considered. Therefore, yesterday the market was selling at 2,000 yuan outside the pass.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Green Tea Has Slight Sales</h3>
<p>In the foreign firms' tea trade, only uncolored Fengmei and Xia Mu goods are being sold slightly by American firms. Yesterday, Yih Ho and Jin Long, etc., bought more than a hundred boxes of this green tea at a price of 260 yuan to 285 yuan. In addition, there are also telegrams sent out by industry insiders to promote colorless Zhenmei green tea, but it has not yet started to be handled. On the 29th, 64 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - White Straight Tribute Serge is Expensive</h3>
<p>White straight tribute serge is extremely scarce on the market, and the factory does not produce it. The shipping of goods from the West has been greatly reduced, and the old inventory is limited. Although the outgoing prices are said to be high, sales are actually still good. As a result, supply is falling short of demand, and the market is trending upwards. The standard market price is rising again and again. Yesterday, good Hua 22 old brand white straight tribute serge was sold wholesale at 50 yuan per yard. Ordinary British-made goods were sold at around 40 yuan. The Futai brand was sold at 32 yuan, the first-class East goods were sold at 31 yuan, the second-class goods were sold at 27 or 28 yuan, and the third-class goods were sold at 23 or 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items - Cowhide and Wool are Imported</h3>
<p>On the 29th, 548 pieces of hemp came from Kalgan, and 277 pieces of wool and 90 pieces of cowhide came from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods - Shandong Twigs Down 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The trend of miscellaneous road twigs has turned weak recently due to narrower sales. The goods that arrived earlier from Chaohuo will be opened up at the water's edge, so the recent batch that has been opened has already dropped by more than 10 yuan. The market price has also followed the decline. Yesterday, Shandong twigs were sold for 72 yuan, and Haikou twigs were sold for 40 yuan. Other bird leaf twigs had few customers, and there was a lack of formal market, it is said.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials - Hawthorn Slices Are Gradually Becoming More Active</h3>
<p>Since the opening price of hawthorn slices became tight, the take-up by the Hong Kong and Guangdong groups has gradually become active, so the market has turned stronger. Yesterday, the market price for pure goods was 44 yuan, and the price for raw goods was 42 yuan. It is found that there has been a lack of arrivals recently, and the market inventory is not very high. The market is expected to continue to tighten.</p>
<h3>Corn</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Since Columbus first opened this "treasure" that is the New World in 1492 AD, how many priceless treasures have flowed to all parts of the world, as a source of nourishment, healing, and refreshment for us mortals! Corn! "Pearl" rice – yet another excellent example.</p>
<p>Corn, also known as pearl rice or baogu (husk grain), is most commonly called bangzi in northern China: the character is not found in dictionaries. The origin of the name cannot be traced; perhaps it is because the mature ear resembles a bangchui (club), and the word bang was corrupted into bang (stick). The Spanish call it "Maiz," which is probably the original name used by the American Indians. Corn was first introduced to China, of course, at the end of the Ming Dynasty: but was it introduced by the Portuguese from Macau? Or, like sweet potatoes, was it transplanted from Luzon? Now, I am making every effort to search, but I am still struggling to find a shred of evidence. As for the names of the heroes who imported or popularized it—for example, we at least still know that Jin Xuezeng and Lin Huailan imported sweet potatoes—there is no need to mention them.</p>
<p>The earliest Chinese record of corn is no more than Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, in which he says: "Corn originates from the West, and it is rare for people to plant it. Its leaves and seedlings are all similar to sorghum, fat and short, and also similar to Job's tears. The seedlings are one to four feet high. In June or July, it blooms and forms ears like shattered wheat. The center of the seedling produces another bud, like the shape of a lou fish, with whiskers hanging from the bud. After a long time, the bud breaks and the seeds come out, clustered together. The seeds are also as large as zhanzi (fodder), and can be stir-fried and eaten: the stir-fried seeds turn white, like stir-fried glutinous rice." Xu Wending Gong also said in the Complete Book of Agricultural Administration: "Shu zha (sorghum) did not exist in ancient times, but later generations obtained its seeds from other places... There is another kind of corn, sometimes called yu mai (jade wheat) or yu shu shu (jade sorghum comb), which was also obtained from other places. The words "mi (rice)," "mai (wheat)," and "shu shu (sorghum comb)" are all borrowed names." Li Shizhen said that it "originated in the West," and Xu Wending Gong said that it "was also obtained from other places." Of course, this can prove that corn is not native to China, but how do we know that its motherland is in the New World? The following quotations are taken from the gist of The Biological World by the Frenchman Contiere, not in the original order, and are supplemented and explained.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians and Indians had no term for corn, and in religion, no trace can be found of it being used for sacrifices or other rituals. The Greeks and Romans did not recognize what it was—even our Chinese "One Farmer Produces Nine Grains:" which includes millet, sorghum, beans, wheat, etc., does not have any trace of corn. Undoubtedly, its ancestral home is not on the Old Continent, but in the Americas!</p>
<p>When the white race discovered America and explored its various treasures in various places, they could see this lush, prosperous, majestic, and tall corn everywhere, from the mouth of the La Plata River in Argentina in the south to Hudson Bay in Canada in the north. Moreover, the Indians have special names for it in each tribe: not only do they rely on it for the only three meals a day, but also when they breathe their last breath, they also take its ears as a very important material to be buried with them in the tomb: this may be to take it as the capital when traveling in their country, or to prepare it as a bribe to appease the anger of the bull-headed Apar—the Indians also believe that the iron-faced and selfless Yama can be softened with bribes, which is really strange—not only that, the great god whom the Indians respect for their merits and virtues is also the "Corn God:" every year there is a fixed date for worshiping the god, and none of the various mysterious offerings displayed are made with corn flour (to be continued)</p>

Therefore, the committee must reconsider the current issue of building a simple and practical building, it is said.</p>

<h3>A Message to Children on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Dear Children!</p>
<p>Children's Day on April 4th is almost here. In this vibrant festival, the spring light has already enveloped you. You have innocent hearts and lively spirits. The goddess of happiness is swaying before you. Your future is bright, your hopes are boundless, dear children! This auspicious day for children is your time of great joy. Together, under the care of your parents and the guidance of your teachers, you are tasting the sweetness of life. This happy life is already yours. Who does not yearn for a happy life? Who does not recognize that life is precious? Your clear, agile, and clean minds will certainly not forget this. But I earnestly wish you, may you forever hold onto this happy outlook on life, and use your keen minds in the future to strive for the survival of the masses and the happiness of society. Therefore, I hope you will not act rashly or blindly follow. Happiness does not come from prayer, nor is it given by others. It must be earned through your own efforts. Your goal is to first seek the wholesome development of your own body and mind, and then strive for the happiness of all people!</p>
<p>You are the vital force of today's society. You must strive with perseverance and with an active and persistent spirit to win your ultimate victory. Do not be afraid, do not retreat. Dear children! This dark universe awaits you to forge a path of light, and the sleeping and intoxicated lives await your innocence to awaken them, to warm their cold hearts...</p>
<p>Dear children! Please forgive me, do not despise, do not reject, but accept my shallow good intentions! Wishing you a radiant flower of life!</p>
<h3>Utilizing Spring Break</h3>
<p>— Ying Dong</p>
<p>This year's spring break is somewhat different from previous years, with some changes in the timing. Starting from the Huanghuagang Memorial on March 29th, there will be nine consecutive days of vacation, ending on April 6th. Nine days may not seem long, but they are not short either. We can certainly use these nine days of vacation to make academic progress. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year is made in spring, and the plan for the day is made in the morning." Understanding this, we should seize this spring break and make full use of it. If we want to utilize the spring break, then the first step, children, is to make a plan.</p>
<p>First, even though the school does not assign spring break homework, we should still automatically decide what work to do during the nine-day holiday. Whether it is reading or writing, the mini-exams have already been taken, so we can find the subjects in which we did not do well and review them during the spring break. If the mini-exams are after the spring break, then it is best to use this spring break to prepare for the exams. As for all extracurricular assignments, such as calligraphy, diaries, and arithmetic exercises, even if the teacher has not assigned them, we should still do the same amount of work as usual and not neglect them because of the vacation. In this way, even if it is only nine days, there will be considerable progress.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot read all day long, so we can set a schedule for the nine-day vacation. As I see it, we should review our lessons every morning, no matter what, and use the afternoon for exercise or spring outings. In the past, we would go on hiking trips during spring break, but now that the war is not yet over, we are not allowed to go on hiking trips due to the environment. We can only go to a few parks to play, or invite some friends to exercise together, such as playing table tennis, kicking a small ball, or discussing academic topics in an informal way. This can improve our intellectual abilities and keep our bodies healthy. In short, going to the countryside for a spring outing and flying kites are all beneficial activities that everyone can do according to their preferences.</p>
<p>In general, spring break is a great time, suitable for both reading and recreation. The mornings are especially valuable, with fresh air and sharp minds, making it easier to make progress in reading and writing. Therefore, during the spring break, we should at least make full use of every morning as a time for academic progress. I hope that all the children will not waste it!</p>
<h3>Children's Song Game</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Spring has arrived,</p>
<p>The weather is good,</p>
<p>The grass is green,</p>
<p>The birds are singing.</p>
<p>Some birds,</p>
<p>Have flown here.</p>
<p>Children:</p>
<p>Please guess,</p>
<p>What kind of bird is this?</p>
<p>(Connect the numbers in the picture below to find out!)</p>
<h3>Competing Abilities</h3>
<p>— Ya Min</p>
<p>One day, the sun and the wind were competing in ability. After much effort, they could not decide who was superior. Later, they saw an old man walking slowly on the road. The wind suggested, "Whoever can make the old man on the road take off his clothes will be the winner." The sun immediately agreed.</p>
<p>The wind began to exert its force, blowing desperately, but the more fiercely the wind blew, the tighter the old man held his clothes. Although the wind was exhausted, it could not make the old man take off his clothes. When the sun released its warm rays, the old man felt warmer and automatically took off his clothes. As a result, the wind failed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sun said to the wind with great pride and a tone of instruction, "Relying on violence to coerce others is useless. It is better to be gentle!"</p>
<h3>Contentment</h3>
<p>— Tong You</p>
<p>Someone asked Franklin, "Why are rich people not happy either?" Franklin saw a basket of apples, took one and handed it to a child playing in the room. The child took it with his small hands. Franklin quickly gave him another one, and the child reached out his other hand to take it. Franklin picked up an even bigger one and gave it to him, but the child still wanted to use his hands to take it, and all three apples fell to the ground. The child began to cry.</p>
<p>Then Franklin said, "You see, the child cannot be satisfied with his possessions. This is why rich people are not happy."</p>
<p>After reading the story above, we know that aggressors are not happy either.</p>
<h3>Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest: Parents' Section Second Place: My Child and Kang Yuan Toys</h3>
<p>— Zheng Linong</p>
<p>I have been drifting on a desert island for three full years. Watching the children grow up, I realize that I have entered middle age. On their innocent smiling faces, I feel a lost youth revive beside me.</p>
<p>I miss my hometown, a hometown with the scent of earth: where the green hills lean, the small river winds, with boundless fields bathed in the quiet sunlight. In the spring, we flew kites; in the summer, we caught grasshoppers; on autumn nights, I counted the stars and made a firefly lantern, falling asleep with a sky full of stars; the days when it snowed in winter were the happiest—the universe was a large factory, with endless toys for you to pick up.</p>
<p>Now I am confined to a small room, the outdoors is a noisy street, and the alleyways are even more chaotic. For three years, my mood has become even more aged. Returning home, seeing two children living in an unclean environment, I feel like I am committing a sin. My wife's suggestion that we shouldn't let them play outside to avoid picking up bad habits like arguing and eating snacks is reasonable. However, a few feet around indoors, in their young and growing hearts, the world is too small. Like two withered flowers, without the nourishment of sunlight and rain, I doubt that they will have full and healthy spirits in the future.</p>
<p>Near Christmas last year, I brought them back from the company, along with a pile of dreams; they clamored to buy toys. They didn't know that the high prices had shattered the joy of being a father. But when I recalled my childhood, when getting a paper-made spinning top under a Price's candle was my only treasure, I had an unspeakable sense of loss. Although the world in my hometown was vast, what I cannot forget is the anticipation of the candle burning out, and the joy of blowing it out and smashing it. So, it is not too much for the children to be amazed by the colorful displays in the shop windows, to tell me, to ask me for them. One day, I made up my mind and reluctantly added a toy item to the budget. I thought: in this city, it doesn't matter if the grass grows in May without butterflies; the children should have a "moving butterfly." And when the new seedlings are planted, the sound of frogs in the paddy fields still plays the symphony of the quiet night, but the children have come to Shanghai far away from them. I should buy them a "jumping frog" and tell them about the music of thousands of frogs singing together.</p>
<p>For two months, the dull air in the small room has suddenly been broken, because I bought a lot of Kang Yuan toys. This is not to say that I got a raise at the store, but rather that Kang Yuan products are ten times cheaper than imported ones, which is affordable for the average person. The children throw them away when they are tired of playing, and then want to play again after a while. Kang Yuan products are mostly made of tinplate and are not easily damaged. So, we have raised several "chickens and ducklings," and the "golden bugs" and "butterflies" are also flying. We turned the rattan chair upside down to serve as a fence, and the washbasin as a pond. The pastoral scenery of my hometown seems to be right in front of me, and we are the masters again!</p>
<p>Ah Da is in the second grade and seems to understand the meaning of war. He has taken in the "fire tank," "giant airplane," and "machine gun" and turned them into his personal mechanized infantry unit, refusing to let his younger brother play with them. But his younger brother likes "climbing monkeys" and "crocodiles," probably because he has been to the Zhaofeng Park Zoo and wanted to bring a monkey back? He also likes to use crocodiles to fight his brother's infantry, and firmly believes that crocodiles have swallowed everything. Watching the crocodile crawl along, it amuses us as well.</p>
<p>"One day, Ah Da may really drive a tank and gallop on the battlefield?" I thought, leaning on the bed.</p>

<h3>Contract Terms for Stars</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Hollywood film magazines often have unfathomable news telling us whether it is fact or promotion, making outsiders feel lost. The many strange and interesting conditions in the contracts of stars are one of them.</p>
<p>Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, a comedic star who was extremely popular during the silent film era, had a special clause in his contract stating: he was not allowed to show a smile on the screen, otherwise, he would be sued in court for breach of contract, so Roscoe Arbuckle was known as the "stone face comedian."</p>
<p>Eddie Cantor's contract stipulated that he was not allowed to grow a mustache, because his charm lies in the special size of his mouth. If he grew a mustache, wouldn't he be concealing his characteristics?</p>
<p>Eddie Quillan's contract stipulated that he must have two weeks of complete rest between filming two films. During this period, no matter how important things are in the company, even a phone call to ask him is not allowed. This is also a unique aspect of the conditions.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford's contract is the most detailed, specifying everything from when to arrive at the set to when to return home, which also shows one aspect of her personality.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo and Ronald Colman never liked outsiders to visit during filming, so they stipulated in the contract that the company could not force them to show their true faces.</p>
<p>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's contracts all had clearly stated that their body weight must be above or below a certain weight. If it exceeded this, there would be a risk of termination. Therefore, the two had to pay special attention to their physical activities to avoid gaining or losing weight.</p>
<p>Wallace Beery was a famous "clock watcher." As long as the time arrived, he would disregard everything, no matter how important the scene was or how much money the set cost. He always walked out with large strides as if it had nothing to do with him. People in the company had no choice because the contract stipulated it.</p>
<p>The late great star Lon Chaney, whom they called the magician of makeup, was regarded as a treasure by the company, but he was not allowed to show his true face. Therefore, to see his true face, you had to first get through to the company.</p>
<p>In short, the clauses in the contracts of famous Hollywood stars often have imaginative ideas that are hard to believe. In fact, they are all just "promotion" methods.</p>
<h3>A Striving Outlook on Life</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>"The way is near, but sought far away; the matter is easy, but sought in difficulty." If you think of solutions this way, the more you think, the more confused you become. Then you sigh and say, "I really have no way." Who knows that the solution is laughing at you in front of you for being useless!</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Swallows Kick Flying Flowers, Falling on the Dancing Banquet</p>
<p>Li Xin thought they wanted money, so he ordered a servant to go inside and get some. He also asked the big man, "Where do you come from? This young lady's skills are really good. What is she to you?" The big man replied, "My surname is Tong, and she is my younger sister. We came here selling entertainment all the way." Li Xin nodded and said, "Very good." The servant had already brought out a plate of patterned silver, containing fifty taels of silver, and placed it on the table. Li Xin pointed to the silver and said to the two, "This silver is a gift from me to you. Please don't be polite and accept it." Upon hearing this, the big man smiled at the red-clothed woman, but did not reply. Li Xin thought they thought it was too little and was about to say more when the big man had already walked to Li Xin's side and said softly, "We have a few important words to say to Master Li. Please dismiss the people around you so that we can speak frankly." Li Xin was taken aback upon hearing this and ordered the servants nearby to leave together. The big man still hesitated to speak. How could Li Xin not suspect something? He couldn't help but ask, "What do you have to say? Just say it. There is no one else here. Please rest assured." The big man looked around again before saying, "What I said to Master Li just now was not entirely true. Please forgive me. We are not performers. We are actually leaders from Qing Shi Mountain. I am Tong Tianbao, and she is my younger sister, Tong Tianfeng, who is known as 'Red Maiden.' Because we were originally street performers, we later went to Qing Shi Mountain, gathered a group of brothers, and started a bandit career. Now we hear that Li Zicheng and others in Shaanxi have raised the banner of rebellion and are gaining momentum. We intend to respond here and strive for the world in the future and share wealth. However, we feel that our momentum is still not great enough. We still need someone with a well-established reputation to raise the banner and call upon the people from all directions. We know that young Master Li has the name of Mengchang and Pingyuan here, and heroes are willing to join him. If Master Li agrees to join us in the uprising, the land of Henan will not be difficult to obtain. Now the fate of the Ming Dynasty is coming to an end. Heroes and extraordinary people in the grass roots should take advantage of the time to rise. Master Li is originally the First Pingyuan Master. Why not take advantage of the situation to plan for the world?" (25)</p>
<h3>Don't Underestimate "Fighting Heroes"</h3>
<p>— Zhuan Yuan</p>
<p>The martial arts profession is divided into martial students, martial actresses, martial warriors, martial others, and "fighting heroes." "Fighting heroes" is another name for "upper and lower hands." This type of role is a supporting role in martial arts plays, such as the many teachers in "Celebrating Ding Zhu" and the many leaders in "The Linked Ring," all of which belong to the short-handed category of "fighting heroes." Long-armored plays include the eight Cao camp generals in "Changban Slope" and the many hammer generals in "Eight Great Hammers." (However, these eight people cannot be completely filled by "fighting heroes" because the famous generals among them must still be played by martial warriors or second-rate martial students, and only unimportant generals are filled by "fighting heroes.")</p>
<p>According to the custom of the pear garden, most of the people who lead the martial arts are wrestling painted faces. Although the backstage has people in charge, all matters, large and small, must still be discussed and handled with them. Most of the "fighting heroes" never study singing, reciting, acting, and speaking. There are two professional terms among insiders: "The upper hand is afraid of fighting Pan He, and the lower hand is afraid of Wudang Mountain." This is because the upper and lower hands cannot speak, and the role of the family general in "Fighting Pan He" is usually played by the upper hand, who should have the line, "Something bad has happened! The two old masters have been shot to death by random arrows." Also, the role of the guard in "Wudang Mountain" is usually played by the lower hand, who should have the line, "It's still early. The people fighting on the ring haven't come yet." Therefore, these two roles are feared by both the upper and lower hands.</p>
<p>When the famous martial student Li Chunlai was in his prime, he often brought his so-called "Hum and Ha Generals," "Four Great Vajras," and sixteen "Somersault Insects." Shen Yunchun, Ju Dekui, Tan Yongkui, and others all belonged to the ranks of the two generals and four vajras. The so-called "Somersault Insects" were also people with high martial arts skills and outstanding kung fu.</p>

<p>Indian stage star Leela stayed in Shanghai for nearly two months. On the 19th and 21st of this month, at the invitation of friends from all walks of life, she gave public performances at the Lyceum Theatre, which were well received. It is understood that she is scheduled to depart for the United States on the Mika Baoma La tomorrow. Hollywood, the area where artists from all over the world gather, will have one more Indian star. I hope she will not follow in the footsteps of Sabu and become a "guide" in aggressive movies.</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Kun actress Green Peony (Qi Meiyu) is marrying Sheng actor Sun Pengzhi today. She and Golden Peony (Qi Shanlan), who married far away to the Philippines, are both daughters of the late actress Qi Yanbing and nieces of Qi Houqing. They are also pillars of the Peony Opera Troupe. Now that they both have their destinations, it is certainly a good thing, but for the Peony Opera Troupe, it cannot be said to be a great loss.</p>
<p>Currently, the Peony Opera Troupe still has several young actors, including Pink Peony, Peony King, Silver Peony, and White Peony. However, Pink Peony is Qi Houqing's wife, with the status of the boss's wife. Silver Peony has already completed her apprenticeship, and White Peony will also complete her apprenticeship this year. Only Peony King is still unmarried and bears the responsibility of supporting the family. According to her, she will not discuss marriage until she is over fifteen years old.</p>
<p>The Green Peony of the Peony Opera Troupe is hereditary. Over the years, Qi Yanbing, Huang Yulin, Yao Yuchan, and the recently married Qi Meiyu have all used Green Peony as their stage name. Then, this vacancy should belong to Peony King. A pair of treasures "Western" Laurel and Hardy</p>
