<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾會談終了　英美發表共同宣言　願被侵各國恢復自主政府　心裁減軍備維持永久和平　皮佛勃洛克赴美商詩細則</h3>
<p>路透社十四日倫敦電　代理首相阿特理、今日午後發表一般人所殷待之言論云、美國羅斯福總統與代表英政府之首相邱吉爾、曾在海上會見、同行者有兩政府之官員、包括海·陸·空軍高級人員在內、美總就與首相曾經數度會議、考慮德國希特勒政府及其各附庸政府所抱軍事統制政策之危及世界文明、並表明英·美應對此項危險所採取之步驟、雙方同意發表聯合宣言如下、</p>
<p>美總統與英首相今茲會見、認爲對於彼等國策之若干共同原則、應有所說明、（一）兩國並無擴大權力、攫取領土及其他野心、（二）兩國不願見有遠反人民意旨之領土變更、（三）兩國尊重一切人民有選擇其政府形式之權利、並願見被武力剝奪之各國恢復主權與自主政府、（四）兩國將致力使世界所有國家、不論大小、不論勝敗、皆可以平等條件享受其經濟繁榮所需要之貿易及原料、而對於現有之條的義務、則予相當之尊重、（五）兩國願促成所有國家在經濟方面充分合作、目的在獲得一切改善之勞工標準、經濟進步及社會安寗、（六）兩國希望在納粹暴虐之最後破壞以後、能建立一種和平、將使各國在其疆陲內可以安居、並將保證各地居民得自由生活、不復再有恐懼及不足之虞、（七）上述和平、應使所有人類得自山橫越各海洋、不受阻礙、（八）兩國深信、世界所有國家、因現實及精神上之理由、必須放棄使用武力、因各國如繼續應用海·陸·空軍備威脅或侵略境外、則未來和平即難維持、彼等又信、在廣大及永久的一般安全制度成立前、上項國家實有解除或裁减軍備之必要、彼等對於足以慰藉愛好和平人民之其他實際辦法、更將予以援助及鼓勵、雙方對於租借法案所規定、以軍火供給英國及積極抵抗侵略各國之全部問題、亦經續加研究、英國供應部大臣皮佛勃洛克動爵、會參加此項談話、並將前往華盛頓與美官方討論細則、屆時將更包括對蘇聯之接濟問題、</p>
<p>路透社十四日倫敦電　代理首相掌璽大臣阿特里、今晚發表之言論、除在英國廣播公司之國內及海外節目中播送外、更由美國廣播系統在美洲轉播、英國廣播公司又將以各種方言、在外語播音節且中、播送此項言論、　合衆社十四日倫敦電　官方本日宣稱、邱吉爾偕其隨員二十三人、離英時極其秘密、故其一行人中、亦有不知目的用爲何處者、</p>
<h3>菲駐美專員　廣播演說　擁護美國政策</h3>
<p>合衆社十四日華盛頓電　菲列濱駐美專員愛里莎爾特、昨晚向全美人士播音、謂菲人巳深悉除非民治國家在目前大戰中獲勝、否則彼等決不能實踐共獨立之理想、渠構人已宜當、在任何事變下、均擁護美國　計、維持中國海區域之現狀、質爲至要、吾人如因綏靖而聽任該區域爲帝國主義國家所控制、則美國及其他民治國家保存自由世界之努力、即將大蒙其害、現時所處於危險中者、全世界自由貿易及重要原料之輸美亦在其中、</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　致書斯達林　重申援蘇決心</h3>
<p>合衆社十四日倫敦電　可靠方面本日透露、羅斯福總統、邱吉爾首相曾共同致書斯達林、表示彼等對於蘇聯立塲之欽敬、並重申彼等之決心給與蘇聯以、切可能之援助、</p>

<p>合衆杜十四晶華盛頓電　白宮昨晚宣布、在星期四東方日光節約時間上午九時三十分至十時之間（上海時間下午十時十分至十一時）白宮將發生重要文告、其性質並未發生、</p>
<p>合衆社十四日華盛頓電　消息靈通界昨稱、一俟羅斯福總統出遊歸來、約值六十萬萬元之第二次租軍程序、即將向國會提出、觀察家相信，該款一大部份、將用以購買食糧、其餘則大部將用以購買巨型及中型之轟炸機、彈藥及大砲云、</p>
<h3>日本國務大臣　平沼騏一郞被刺　兇手藉口求親筆字跡　約時來訪竟出槍射擊　平沼負傷追捕兇手西山當就逮</h3>
<p>合衆社十四日東京電　日本國務大臣平沼麒一郎、本日在私邸遇刺、被槍擊致傷、警察宜佈兇手名西山、年三十五歲、藉口求平沼之親筆字跡、約時來訪、詎竟用手槍射擊、</p>
<p>彈中頸部　平沼雖受傷、仍追捕兇手、追至門外、兇手即爲守衛所獲、日皇下午一時派遣御醫松永前往診視、並與皇后共同致送水菓數筐、近衛首相暨其他政府高級官員、亦皆至平沼之私邸探視、偵查該案之警察、在下午一時始許報紙發表此事、</p>
<p>據同盟社宣稱、東京地方刑事法院檢事處宣布、此决冀圖行刺事件、係於本日上午八時發生於平沼家中、檢事處報告、石矢係於上午八時往訪平沼、二人在平沼家中會客室談話時、石矢突然拔出</p>
<p>手槍開放　平沼之狀况、檢事處並未透露、平沼於一九三九年一月五日在第一次近衛內閣崩潰後、即拜命組閣、但八閱月之後、渠之內閣亦於蘇·德簽訂不侵公約之後崩潰、在近衛二次組閣時、平沼被任爲內相、至近衛第三次組閣時、平沼仍留內閣中任政務大臣、平沼年七十六、久以「日本之頭號法西斯主義者」見稱、乃反動愛國團體國粹社之領袖、爲一切自由主義之勁敵、但在一九三九年一月五日就任首相時暨在最近之談話中、平沼常表示政黨應可在政府中發言、人民之願望亦應尊重、渠之友人謂、渠之</p>
<p>加心轉意　乃因年事已高之故、平沼向係獨身、此在日本殊爲罕見、因爲兒女籌措婚事、乃日本父母之最重要義務也、平沼偶然飮酒、亦喜日本之土酒、而不喜洋酒、此爲平沼之國端國家主義之一端、但渠吸烟則喜吸英國之威斯明斯特牌、而不喜日本士產、平沼出身貧困、誕生於日本西北部之岡山縣、一八八八年畢業於東京帝國大學法科後、即入法省、積資升遷至大審院院長、一九二三年山本組閣時渠任法相、渠雖出任　職、但渠一向仍在東京帝國大學研究並敎授法律、一九〇七年該大學贈與法學博士學位、一九二六年年</p>
<p>授予男爵　爵位、平沼任法相後、即入貴族院、至一九二六年獲得爵位後、即任樞密院副院長、一連十年、平沼皆未能任樞密院院長、其中主要原因、乃因渠公然反對日皇之最高顧問牧野、牧野爲自由主義者、於一九三六年二二六事變遇刺、同年平沼即升任樞密院院長、自此以後、平沼即與國粹社脫離關係、數年前平沼曾表示其反國粹社之見解、謂「法西斯主義在意大利或甚佳、但余並不以為法西斯主發、共產主義或希特勒主義係對於日本有利」、通常可靠方面稱、平沼</p>
<p>一眼被擊　中、但政府今午拒絕證實此點、日內閣情報局副發言人石井宣稱、「平沼乃日本現時之重要人物、故必須先行澈底偵查、始可向報界發表正式文告」云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>亞洲的經濟戰</h3>
<p>第一次世界大戰中的亞洲民族，除少數參與毀減勾當外，中日兩國幸免捲入漩渦，因此亞洲處女的經濟實力、于以保存。今日重演世界大戰，自可推繹其根由於第一次的爆發，武器之犀利與士卒之用命，旣有精進之表演，它激成全亞民族擇定陣綫而參戰。安祥仁慈之亞洲民族乃分荷愴執戈，以待死神之來臨，此豈咎由自取，抑為天　物競之淸算，必使全人類經此階段，而始登彼岸？顧無論此事演變之趨向如何，亞洲人民縱欲保持戰前之原狀與秩序，殆將為事實所勿許，此固我人所急應綢繆未雨者也。</p>
<p>亞洲資源之充裕，甲於全世界，而我國得天獨厚儲蓄人皆知，所惜未能及時開拓利用，以致迎蜂惹蝶，由來已久，此異族侵略之所以日趨嚴重，而將於大戰中獲得總解決。</p>
<p>納粹近竟根據經濟資源分布之現狀，將世界劃分為四大自給自足之國家：納粹統治歐洲全部與非洲全部，蘇聯統治中亞與西伯利亞，美國統治南北兩美洲，日本統治東亞洲海濱全部。此種狂妄夢囈之理想，當置諸勿論，但其昭示爭奪經濟之目標，則可一覽而盡。近日南太平洋已呈劍拔弩張，一觸即發之勢，足徵各國已忍無可忍，而將訴諸武力之解決。顧人類所欲取給於亞洲者，固何所指，請試言之。</p>
<p>亞洲之主要資源而為西方各國所賴以維持生產者，有絲，鎢，銻，橡皮，錫，錳等出品，其中為美國所採用着約佔半數。美國之鋼業，罐頭，汽車，與農具等製造廠需要鉅量之成錫，而成錫之製造須先將亞洲之生錫運至英國或荷蘭鍊製，然後運至美國。若產錫區域全為日軍佔領或南太平洋航路為日軍所截斷，美國之軍需工業即將大受打擊，而陷於停頓，蓋目前絕無有效之補救方法也。錳與銻亦全恃亞洲之供給，古巴與巴西雖略有生產，但無濟於事，且無代用品，故為必爭之國防原料，此滇緬公路之所以成為重要國際運輸綫也。至於鎢與絲皆有代用品，在美國不足為患，而美國反得利用此點以攻擊日本，蓋美國不購日絲而再禁油料輸日，即足予日本以重創。關於橡皮之供給，則有墨西哥與巴西兩國源源接濟，在美國絕無中斷之虞。</p>
<p>今觀日本南進之目的何在，論者嘗以為日本之覬覦荷屬東印度為攫取其橡皮，錫與礦油大宗出品，以充實其軍需原料，而揆諸事實，則又不盡然。蓋越南與泰國同屬生產橡皮之區，每年每國生產五萬噸左右，每年可合產十萬噸，而日本之軍需至多不得超過五萬噸，是以一國之產額即足供日本之消費，無向東印度搜索之必要·又兩國之錫產亦足敷日本之軍需。惟礦油一項則為東印度天賦之特產，而兩國所產極尠，此為日本南進目的之一，自無疑義。同時截留此唯一國際路綫輸出之錫，銻，與錳，以打擊美國，亦必為其目的之一。美國固可遏止日本取東印度之礦油，而日本亦未嘗不可大吹大擂，阻撓美國攫取其錫。至於亞洲大陸上所產之錫，銻，與錳，自必易為日軍所搜括，而美國必倍感還擊之困難。南太平洋經濟資源爭奪之形勢殆如此。</p>
<p>我國地大物博，天時地利人和三者俱備，惜未能盡其用，而致遭强鄰之虎視耽耽，誠屬憾事。顧我人非特無吝嗇之念，且主張與各國志同道合者合作，開發我國之資源，以供世界人類之共同享受。第我人所力爭者，經濟合作，必須互惠互助，而非片面的。若採取侵略之行為，强取豪奪，決非吾人所能忍受，必須予以有力之打擊。</p>
<h3>美國運接濟品　八十萬噸來華　為美援華程序一部份　緬甸公路貨運可增加</h3>
<p>重慶　據此間負責方面消息、美國現運接濟品八十萬噸來華、為美國援華程序之一部份、美藉運輸專家於視察緬甸公路之後宜稱、目前經過該路之貨運噸位、可增加一倍甚至兩倍云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>中國留美學生　美允前往</h3>

<h3>印度詩聖　泰戈爾訪問的回憶（一）</h3>
<p>— 徐寶謙</p>
<p>八旬高翁的印度詩聖泰戈爾氏，巳於本月十七日在加爾各答逝世了，東方文明喪此木鐸，誠如將委員長唁電所云。記者曾於兩年前，因赴印出席世界基督敎大會之便，得遍訪印度當代名人，如甘地，泰戈爾，尼赫魯之流，會蒙泰氏招待，在氏所創辦之國際大學，逗留兩日，得親瞻泰氏丰采，親聆泰氏言論，並得參觀氏所舉辦之敎育事業及農村改良事業，私衷常引以為快。茲因申報友人之囑，特為撰文數篇，藉以介紹泰氏生平，文章，思想及事業之一斑。</p>
<p>訪問團的發起</p>
<p>世界基督敎大會，於民國二十七年十一月底在印度瑪都拉城開會，一部份中國代表即邀請熟悉印度情形且曾經數度到過中國的英國友人雷斯德女士，發起一個國際訪問團，當時加入的共十餘人，代表英美中日加拿大南非（黑種人）幾個國籍。日本基督敎聞人賀川丰彥本擬加入，因事中止，改由村尾加入。我們一行於三十日上午離瑪都拉北行，翌日晨到華特哈，行數哩即達聖雄甘地的住處，邨名Swgaon。二十八年一月二日晨離華特哈，四日晨到加爾各答，七日到Santiniketan（和平鄉之意），即泰氏所居地，亦即國際大學所在地。</p>
<p>訪問泰氏的經過</p>
<p>泰氏所辦國際大學給我們第一個印象，就是它看來並不是普通大學的校址，而是一座大森林。古樹參天，環境幽靜。等到我們看見了各處散布着的建築物，及三五成羣的男女學生，方始恍然大悟，原來這是一所林間學府。</p>
<p>泰戈爾氏對於我們特別優待，我們所住的是西式房屋，吃的也是西餐，這種情形，同甘地那邊招待客人的情形，眞是大不相同了、</p>
<p>七日下午一時三刻，蒙泰氏破例（據說泰氏通常會談時間常在下午五時）伺我們作三刻鐘的談話。時泰氏年已七十八歲了。雖以腰背稍彎，但目光炯炯，精神奕奕，白髮下垂，銀鬚修長，御絲質長袍，身長鼻高。使我們不能不連想到照相中所見俄國文豪托爾斯泰的神采。我們一行，圍着泰氏環坐着，在三刻鐘裏問了他許多關於各方面的問題。照我記憶所及，多半集中在泰氏對於國民運動的態度，氏的國際思想，及氏所手辦的敎育事業及農村工作。</p>
<p>泰氏坦白地告訴我們，他對於國民運動，表示深刻的同情。他很佩服甘地的人格及領導民衆的才能。他也很讚賞尼赫魯，認為是「後起之秀」。不過他說：他已經老了，而且他到底是個詩人，所以對於這個偉大的民族解放運動，不能多作貢獻，這是使他覺得抱歉的地方。</p>
<p>泰氏還告訴我們：不幸得很，他蒙了詩人的「惡名」，因此，人們總想他是不注意人生的實際問題的。其實呢，他所辦的敎育，完全是同人生打成一片。而且，他所辦的農村工作，還是開風氣之先，因為，那時甘地所領導的國民運動，還未曾着手改革農邨。</p>
<p>泰氏又說：他在文藝作品中，提倡解放受壓迫的階級，在數十年前已開始了。如今晚我們所能看到的舞劇，劇本是泰氏中年時代的作品。泰氏根據佛經中阿難受魔女試探的故事，編成這個劇本。他把魔女放在幾種階級內，末了，她與阿難同蒙佛光普照，獲得救度。這樣，表證了泰氏解放平民的思想。</p>
<p>泰氏主張調和東西文化，主張國際和平。他竭力反對一切侵略的戰爭。他對日本文化固有的優點，深表欽佩。但對於日本近來傾向軍國主義的潮流，深表不滿。八一三戰事發生時，中國成千成萬無辜人民，遭受轟炸，引起了印度全國輿諭的不滿。日本著名詩人野口素與泰氏相識，他為愛國心所驅使，於　十七年春間，寫信給泰氏，對於日本優華的舉動，為政府辯護。因此，引起了泰氏的不滿。野口因泰氏的復書，措詞直率，於八月間，又致書泰氏。泰氏得書後，對野口大失所望，復書嚴責。泰氏曾將與野口往復辯難的四封信，分印成本，分送我們各一冊。我讀後曾詢同行的日人村尾，據答曰，此必泰氏請人代寫的罷，一其措詞可謂巧妙。</p>
<p>參觀泰氏的事業</p>
<p>七日下午三時半，我們被請參加泰氏招待印度某親王的盛大交誼會。書說，親王的父親，是泰氏的摯友，對於泰氏所辦的事業，曾捐過不少款項。會中遇見三位中國學生：一名王君晶（女士），因家住緬甸，所以就近來學；一名石岫盧，（江蘇人）；一名石法週，兩人俱已受戒出家，且曾在錫蘭住過一年。我們在他鄉相遇，自然另有一種情感。會後，參觀國際大學校舍及內部設備（詳情見下文）。七日晚七時至九時，國際大學的男女學生，為某親王表演泰氏所寫的歌舞劇，劇名Chadra，內容叙述阿難尊者受魔女試探及蒙如來佛神通救度的故事。（未完）</p>

<h3>美已完成必要準備　對遠東具有決心　預計明春將有重大轉變　世界和平現已奠定基礎</h3>
<p>據大陸報昨日所刋華盛頓特電、美已將其海空軍全部準備就緒、決心遏阻日本在遠東之新冒險行動、故兩國關係、大有一觸即發之勢、如蘇聯能抵抗德軍至要年冬、並由中英美荷協力於明年春擊敗日本、則英國必能將在遠東之兵力、移至歐洲、消滅希特勒勢力、則一九四二年末、世界和平、即有實現希望、美國務卿赫爾、十二日所發表之聲明、殆即為說明美國之最終目的、</p>
<p>大陸報昨日曾刊載一華盛頓十三日特電云、今日之美日關係、已達一觸即發之勢、據消息靈通方面聲稱、美國方面、似早決定將其海空軍全部準備就緒、以遏制日本在遠東方面之新擴展、今日之英美、在政策上與行動上、已全趨一致、設日本以軍事行動南進或北犯、則日本必遭遇武力制裁、</p>
<p>美國佈置攻守咸宜</p>
<p>據此間有資格之遠東問題觀察家談、在過去二年中、美國政策、頗使大多數華人失望、惟此一政策、殆在使美國得以從容佈置軍事、並使英國在西歐天空中、獲得一更鞏固之地位、俾阻遏軸心國在世界各處獲得勝利、二年前、美國毫無準備、國會行動、旣甚遲鈍、而民衆態度又復冷淡、任何激烈措置、在彼時均屬不宜、二年前、新加坡與緬甸、均未有準備、且羅斯福總統以美國驅逐艦交換所得之大西洋根據地、其時亦未有攻守咸宜之設施、設美日在其時作戰、則英國所能獲得之少量美國飛機、將被截阻、並足以促成英國失敗、而使日本得可能之勝利、然今日之情勢、巳迥不相同、因德對蘇作戰、大量消耗人力及機械、故信對希特勒如能遏阻至本年冬、則民主國必可獲勝利、</p>
<p>分工合作反抗侵略</p>
<p>該觀察家吿記者、如德國受挫、則世界全面戰爭之「大戰略、」即在打擊日本、並由中英美荷之協力同心、在來春將日本擊敗、此戰略設能完成、則希特勒之情况、將吿絕望、日本之威脅巳除、太平洋之局勢、即可轉趨穩定、則中國自菲列濱·夏威夷·馬來亞·及荷屬東印度等地、獲得飛機之供給、中國是時之責任、即在掃蕩被困中國本部之日本軍隊、在此種情形下、英國在新加坡之全部軍力、荷印軍力、以及美國遠東艦隊、均可栘調至大西洋、使希特勒在歐洲陣地毀滅、觀察家深信蘇俄必能遏阻德軍以至本年冬、在來年春前、並能削弱日本之實力及其威脅、如此犖犖數大端能實現、則一九四二年末、將與和平俱來、</p>
<p>赫爾聲明態度堅決</p>
<p>此間洞悉國會及美國民衆雖無說明、然對向日作戰之熱烈贊助、遠勝於贊助參加純粹歐戰、美國大部人民、仍認歐戰為一純粹關於歐洲之戰事、故對希特勒之西半球計劃、不探多加注意、然一般美國人士、在了解日本者、皆深信日本並非一理想之友邦、昨日美國國務卿赫爾、對美國目的及政策之申明、並非用以作對日或其他國家之誘餌、而係就本旨對美國政策作一最後之綜述、此項政策、向以合理渙當之方法、以維持和平為根據、臻此即將參戰之際、此申明殆為肯定說明美國之目的也、</p>
<h3>英情報處原址　準備遷讓</h3>
<p>昨載北京路二號格令蘭大廈之日方業主、巳通知該廈內英情報處遷讓一訊、據英文大美晚報云、頃接英情報處稱、日方業主雖未勒令遷出、但已通知於租約期滿時遷讓、故英情報處現正作此準備、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海盛傳華懋地產公司巳將漢彌登大廈售予某中日商號、而出售河濱大廈、亦在談判中一說、頃由華懋地產公司某員加以切實否認、</p>
<h3>善團舉辦　南市急賑　封鎖狀態未除　施賑界域擴大</h3>
<p>南市飢饉載道各慈善團體深致關懷、本市同孚路中敎道義會、自組織救濟組、推動南市貧民急賑後、連日散放賑品、繼績不輟、前日值滬戰紀念日、亦照常派車前往放發麥餅饅首麥粉等賑品、現施賑範圍、已推及唐家灣·城隍廟·海潮寺路·斜土路、龍華路·高昌廟·等各處、據悉。該會此項急賑、將繼續至封銷狀態完全消除為止、以惠一般貧民、</p>
<h3>各銀行未了結外匯　限令今日軋平　泰萊將提管理匯市方策　申請外匯尙無具體辦法</h3>
<p>自英美兩國凍結令付諸實施後、中外各銀行在執行上、有欠明瞭及發生困難之處甚多、平準委員福克斯幫辦泰萊氏之來滬即為作指示與調查、泰萊氏抵滬後、業已於十三日與花旗銀行等各外商銀行、作初步接洽、但截止昨日、尚未聞與中國銀行界方面發生接觸、聞泰氏返港、將就在滬上調查結果、按照政府決心穩定滬上滙市、及切實管理與跋防日方套取原則、向平準會作一建議、盛傳有維持美滙五元、英匯三便士說、</p>
<p>華商銀行將有建議</p>
<p>華商銀行方面、聞亦將向外滙平準基金委員會提出一建議、請示對中國正當商人申請外滙、是否需要辦理申請手續、以關於此點、中國財政當局、迄未頒佈具體辦法、致無所運循、按現時權宜辦法、凡屬正當商人、向中外銀行申請外滙、（一）祗須與銀行向有往來者、（二）提出證件、證明確係正當需要者、其辦法之簡易、頗多流弊、以日方儘可利用上海自由貿易港作為媒介、由上海轉口、吸收外來物資也、</p>
<p>限期今日軋平外匯</p>
<p>中國銀行會通吿各經營外滙之華商銀行、對七月二十六日前簽發之支票與押滙票據、如能依照一般照會五十五號規定、仍准與美國各行往來賬戶辦理收付、如欲轉賬、則可按照一般照會六十號之規定、由中央銀行代辦、茲悉中央銀行已限令各行、將上項未收付外匯、限令日軋平、代為辦理收付、此項辦法、端在使此等銀行、避免因資金凍結而遭遇業務上之困難、蓋以八月期而論、華商銀行之外匯買賣、竟發生賣空現象、因此舉含有投機性質、中央銀行乃嚴飭有此等情事之華商銀行、即日補進、限於今日一律軋平淸楚、昨日報載中央銀行將公佈管理黑市外滙辦法之說、乃限期軋平外滙買賣之誤、中央銀行為恐傳聞失實、影響匪淺、已於昨日正式切實否認，</p>
<p>黑匯猖獗籌劃補救</p>
<p>常凍結資金之令發出後、本埠市塲人心、大都以外匯黑市即將無形消滅、至少亦不致再有過去之劇烈變化、不料黑市外匯、買賣依舊自由、與以前一般無二、且實際上外匯之控制權、已轉入十四家外商洋行之手、連日以來、公司結款甚多、投機商又藉進口洋行名義、暗中扒吸、於是外商銀行乘機扳俏、不肯多所供給、雖有賣價還出、但如向之求結、往往不能如數得到、於是求過於供、匯價趨緊、匯豐掛牌連縮三日、美匯黑市敲破五元大關、英匯緊况空前、欲穩定黑市而不得、</p>
<h3>商團華隊　協助警戒</h3>
<p>本屆滬戰第四週年紀念、當局對於戒備佈防、較往年更為嚴密、除警捕全體出動外、萬國商團團員亦參加協助出防、中華隊乃繙譯隊各員亦奉命特組車巡隊二十六組、自九日黎明五時起、至昨晨八時止、乘武裝車日夜輪流巡邏中區各要道、故戒備期問、界內秩序安然、絕無意外發生、至二隊其餘各員、於該戒備期內、亦均戎裝候令、隨時準備出動、此次商團全體華員、不避炎暑、踴躍參加、且有少數隊員、抱恙出防、其熱心服務地方之精神、深堪敬佩、洵為我華人爭光不少、今日起兩租界仍恢復普通戒備、</p>
<h3>工商局工業社會處調查　支薪階級生活費　徵求華籍記賑家庭五百家</h3>
<p>近來物價日高、對於支薪階級之生活費用、頗有影響、工部局工業社會處現有生活費指數、原為工人西僑而編、不適用於中國支薪階級、茲為適應需要起見、添編支薪階級生活費指數一種、以中國籍家庭為限、其入手辦法、為徵求職員家庭五百家、每家自民國三十年十月一日起、記收支細賬三個月、該處印有特製賬冊、按月分寄各記賬家庭、每家編有號碼、賬冊封面、不戰姓名、只有號碼、分析之後、發表指數、此外毫無其他用意、亦無任何費用、</p>
<p>記賑家庭三項標準</p>
<p>凡對於此項統計深感興趣諸家庭、可於九月五日以前、將姓名住址、逕寄江西路工部局工業社會處、記賬家庭標準如後、（一）記賬家庭、限於上海中國籍支薪階級、家中職務、不限行菜、惟農民工人或自設企業者不合選、（二）家主薪津及其他收入等、不問多寡、惟平均每月以不出法幣一千元為限、家數分配、在五百元以下者、應占十之七、五百至一千元者、占十之三、其薪給為外幣者、不合選、（三）家庭人口、至少夫妻二人、連同子女及依賴者、以不出十人為度、寄寓者及僕役在外、</p>

<h3>被拋棄了十年　傾吐無限隱痛　助學金申請者訪問記之八</h3>
<p>L小姐今年十九歲，暑期後擬進某敎會大學的英文系；她的妹妹，十二歲，已考取某敎會女學；她倆同時來申請助學金。在L小姐的略歷項下塡着：「父於申請人八歲時因有外遇，棄家不顧，迄今已達十餘載」。我看到了這張申請表，引起熱切的注意，便於收到證件的翌日，就去訪問。</p>
<p>乘廿二路公共汽車到福履理路祁齊路口下車，再往西走了不遠的路，找到了她們的住址，敲了幾下石庫門上的銅環，一位少婦開開了門。</p>
<p>『這裏有姓L的嗎？」我問這位少婦。同時我瞥見客堂裏做着房間，非常整潔。</p>
<p>『你是那裹來的？有什麼事？』這位少婦謙和地問我。</p>
<p>『我是報館裏　為助學金事情來的。我要訪問兩位L小姐，是不是住在這裏？」</p>
<p>「是的，這裏有姓L的。他們住在三樓亭子間裏。』</p>
<p>『我可以從這裹進去嗎？」因為客堂是房間，我不敢造次進去，得到了她的許可，並引我穿過客堂，走上扶梯，我回身向她道聲謝謝。</p>
<p>走上三樓的亭子間，一位五十左右的女太太，已在房門口應聲迎迓。我走進亭子間，這位太太請我在一只方凳上坐下，倒了一杯開水，她便坐在我對面的床舖上。室中的陳設很簡單，但很潔凈，我已測知這個家庭是相當高貴的。</p>
<p>「兩位小姐　向我們報館裏申請助學金，今天特地來訪問的；這兩位小姐都出去了嗎？這位就是L太太嗎？」</p>
<p>「不敢當，正是。眞是不巧，她們兩人都有點事情出去了。』L太太輕聲軟氣地帶着沉着的語氣回答我的問話。</p>
<p>L小姐考××大學　諒必錄取了吧？看成續她的學業是挺好的。」</p>
<p>『考期還沒有到。她們還算用功，大的一個在中學讀書的時候，一面就担任家庭敎師，補貼零用，因為經濟太困難了。』</p>
<p>『L小姐有幾位　姊妹弟兄？L先生做什麼事？他現在那裏呢？』</p>
<p>L太太聽了我的話，嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「我們的家庭　應該可以儘量幫助人家的，誰料到現在過着這樣的艱難的生活，孩子們讀書還要請求人家來幫助！』L太太帶着傷感的語氣，述說她的遭遇和家庭情形。『孩子們的父親是政府裹的立法委員，十年前把我們拋棄了！當初我曾向法院起訴，開了幾庭沒有結案，後來他向外埠一溜，這訟案便擱了起來，從此他便把家庭整個的遺棄了，子女也不顧了！</p>
<p>「大兒子今年二十六歲，已成家，現在秦皇島海關做事，現在每月全靠他寄來一百元，維持我們。第二個女兒，二十四歲，閒在家裏。第三個女兒，二十二歲，担任着一家的家庭敎師。第四個女兒十九歲，剛剛中學畢業，要想進大學，所以向貴報館申請，因為我自己不識字，當然希望子女都能好好的給她們讀書，可是現在那有力量呢？第五個兒子，十七歲，去年到後方投軍去了，聽說現在什麼軍官學校裹。第六個女兒，十二歲，小學剛畢業，巳考取了××女學。她們都很好，不過小女兒下半年進中學，路途很遠，往返很不便，費用也很大：她不能像她姊姊一面讀書，一面敎書，賺幾個零用錢咧。」</p>
<p>家庭間的糾葛，個人心上的創痛，平素原不肯輕易對人傾吐；但為了申請助學金的訪問，在道義上我原不想，也不該窮究人家過去的一切，只探問目前的經濟生活狀况。不料却因此引起申請人的家長們內心的創痛，毫不隱藏地向我們傾吐她們的人生悲苦的歷程。這是我們萬分抱歉而尤應寄予無限同情的。</p>
<p>我很懷疑一位國家的立法委員竟不能「立」他自身的「法」</p>
<p>「L太太，你的子女都很有志氣，你還是有福氣的人啊！」我臨別時同情地安慰她。（T）</p>

<h3>紗花　期紗多頭粉至沓來　現紗行市節節帶高</h3>
<p>紗市又轉上風、此因盤旋多日、引起多頭活動、因之反動尤烈、同時港幫對於三二支單紗需要殷切、而售價步騰、以致人心良好、加之取引所紗布市况節節上漲、於是一般投機商心思更濃、買風驟起、市盤乃前進矣、不過港幫對於二十支紗交易依然淸淡、實力充足之空額尙不抵補、一般浮空、鑒於局勢緊張、開始由空翻多、所以穿出百六元關外、漲力校强也、二十支雙馬高價為一千六百四十一元、低價為一千六百二十四元、午後初做一千六百三十三元、因取引所價昂、人心又旺、買勢愈烈、直升至一千六百五十五元、最後價為一千六百五十二三元、目前紗市情形、有人說漲了幾十元要賣、反之則進、完全投機作用也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人氣即熱烈、因上日取引所價已高、多頭跟進、首盤價為一千六百三十元、少頃跌至一千六百二十四元、然聞藍鳳紗價不鬆、買方加碼、浮空處此環境之下、無力抵抗、紛起扒補、又升至一千六百四十一元、然盈利人吐出、又鬆至一千六百三十二元、收盤價為一千六百三十六元、查半日間成交統計七千七百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、香港　二○○同行七、五○○統計七、七○○</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、續承上日之餘威、再度猛晋、展初開出、雖現紗因前日無市而猛漲二十餘元、但期紗則徘徊不前、八月期開出為一四七五元、尙軋小三元、九月期為一五五四元、亦降落三元、十月期為一五六八元，小元半、入後以金市吿昂、取引所亦多上升、故人心激昂、多頭家紛至沓來、市價於買氣籠罩下節節上漲、第以浮多與散戶時有售出、乃午收八月期為一四七八元、九月期一五六一元、十月期一五七八元五角、尙呈參差、成交九千二百二十包、午後市態益呈挺秀、利多消息頻傳、加以現紗脚地堅穩、更引起買戶之憑籍、是以檯面求過於供、價格直上靑雲、尤以近收盤時、因金市塲外做近二百元、故三盤十月期一度破出一千六百元大　之外、結果八月期為一四八九元、收市軋漲十一元、九月期為一五七九元、高升二十二元、十月期為一五九六元、猛漲、二六元五角之多、近遠期相差一百○七元、全日共成交一萬六千四百四十包、比上日增加六千九百四十包、觀紗市脚地之挺硬、不無多頭家之拉抬、與其他之因素、加以散空之抵袖、恐尙有造成上升之機會也、茲列全日經過市價表於後、</p>
<h3>美棉貸款業已通過　細絨已是有漲無跌　紐約買進同業投機補空皆有　滬上成交細絨不及粗絨之多</h3>
<p>本埠棉市情况更形熱烈、交易活潑、價格堅挺、四十二支及三十二支原料、依然有漲無跌、惟細絨究以價格過昂、現貨無多、做開較少、粗絨需要雖不旺、然號家交易稱盛、以致外棉交易、因人心興奮、而有熱烈展開、美棉米特林及高級巴西棉皆較上日挺進五六元不等、良以各方購意不惡、及美印棉再見堅昂、一般花號家及囤戶意向、羅致現貨、再接再厲、同時少數廠方亦紛紛定購九十月抵滬之大枇巴西棉、藉以競爭、昨日怡和洋行裕生輪晨此滬、由印度喀爾喀塔運來棉花四千五百件、堆儲於羅斯福棧房、經此到貨不絕、紗廠原料、即使時局有變化、尙不至有匱乏之虞、惟人心皆為本棉悉遭攘奪、不得不惟洋花是求、致有此現象耳、咋日棉花交易如下、</p>
<p>紐約棉市先因賣方壓力而跌、但繼之即因華盛頓政治消息、國府順利通過司密斯議案而反漲、同業買進、投機買進、及一般空頭抵補者、均活躍一時、結果收盤價格、較之上日猛漲五十地至五十六磅音左右、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因歐洲出口商買進而漲、旋因散戶賣出而跌、但續後又因空頭扺袖、及投機者買進再漲、昨日收盤價格、各漲二至六羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况、因美棉漲勢猛烈、而看漲五羅比、</p>

<p>投機繼起爭扒</p>
<p>自晨外　印銀略縮、美英銀市均平、各國滙兌英對滬小○三一二五、美對滬縮三分、餘平、中央掛牌各滙米更、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英滙二辦士九二一八匕五、美金四元九○六二五、日商洋行首來扒進九月美金四元八七五、即趨軟化、滙豐掛牌未更、小櫃檯未滙仍四元八七五、白銀平衡稅仍微百分之二四·二五後、局勢趨穩甚久、洋行力扒美金四元八七五、十點後續緊、滙豐小櫃檯美滙亦改縮至四元八一二五、投機家及老中庸扒進八月四元八四三七五、華商冉扒八月四元八一二五為最緊、滙豐與美銀行有供意、一度四元八七五可結、但至正午收市四元八四三七五、美金二辦士九○六二五、</p>
<p>沙遜亦有需要</p>
<p>下午中外商行供意稍佳、故在沙遜與華商及日行三重扒風中、均力結九月期新交易為四元八七五、市勢反稍帶硬、直至三點半收市、現貨至九月期、均英滙二辦士八九○六二五、美金四元八四三七五、（四元八七五為難結難賣價）、比上日收市英緊○三、二五、美緊○六二五、</p>
<h3>金市又吿抬頭</h3>
<p>八月期臨去依然堅挺</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市、即聞外匯趨緊、即抬至七千一百元外、為七于一百二十元、計開高三十六元、嗣大戶進出不一、多空方掙扎、故升至七千一百三十元、又退至七千一百十元、證券幫買意興濃、同康·永·益大·德孚及鼎盛·天元·恒記力進、頓見哄起三十元、為七千一百四十元、熾大·新豐永吐售、聞匯豐小櫃檯美匯掛牌仍四元八七五、當見回退至七千一百○二元、因證券幫不斷收吸、祥興永仁承永亦進、轉趨穩堅、十點後小櫃標美匯改縮至四元八一二五、人心更形振奮、祥興永合盛、晋元誠達、義元收吸、又哄上四五十元、達七千一百八十五元、午刻美滙回硬至四元八七五可結、引起賣風、義豐·益大·祥和·祥興永·均來售出、立降四十元、至七千一百四十五元、義元再進、升二十餘元、午收七千一百六十八元、軋升八十四元、有八十三元差度、</p>

<h3>到米萬八千包　存糧充沛　可是米蠧心不死</h3>
<p>洋米來源湧旺、本星期來已有十萬句到滬、太古公司北海輪、前日（十三日）傍晚抵埠、由暹羅裝來洋米一萬三干三百十包、經香港又裝來四千六百二十一包、共計一萬七千九百三十一包、停靠浦東本行碼明起卸、又怡和洋行裕生輪昨晨到滬、由香港運來洋米四千零八十七包、由喀爾喀塔裝來印度洋米二百五十包、該洋米係本市印僑採購、（祖）</p>
<p>昨洋米市呈盤旋之象、早早晨進出兩平、市無出入、繼因洋米到頭有暹米三萬八千零五十包外、尙有緬越港米數批亦將相繼到埠、浮多立即趁平回出、本街內地納胃亦呆、囤戶亦未儘興收買、市面乃轉小為跌、期現各米一致小去元外、但價落後本客即有隨市添辦、而投機客囤又以南洋不能無事、趁平吸收、人心望好、市價立即反疲為挺、結果部期現貨仍與前收相似、而大部四仍較小數角（碎米英華司上週末一百零九元外者昨紙一百零八元三角、小絞自一百叫十八元半、九元、九元半、大至一百五十元、暹羅二號自一百四十一二元至一百四十三四元不等、總計成交七八百噸、現米成交仍有萬餘包、新糙客秈昨由蕪湖到　批、的百餘包、價開一百二十元、蕪湖及附近長江帶今年收成極佳、故後首或能讀到、不過產雖自有、權為人操、能否供我食用、且觀其後、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、因朝停市、到貨頓見積多、且兼出新日旺、致人心立餒、本鄕店銷旣滯、貨主售意更鬆、若南港早晚稻價傾瀉二元左右、祇開百五十三元、百五十一元、無錫原包白粳則因市貨素稀、而搬運又以產地路途較遠、頗多不便、故價雖貶不多、僅略被帶落元砠、開新鮮貨百五十五元至百五十二元、决貨百四十七元、浦東新粳因假前一度貶短後、去路較爽、尙無愛化、仍開百五十七元、較次者百五十六元、</p>
<p>糯米雖屬落令、銷塲零星但市貨亦寥、故供求頗勻、市乏榮辱、繼開杳港白元高自百二十六七元、次至百二十四兀、糯茶百十五元至百十三元、國糯白二十八九元、</p>

<h3>孱弱者的自白：我對於申請助學金者的希望</h3>
<p>— 新塘</p>
<p>頭腦固然要健全　身體也絕對康强</p>
<p>我離開中學已六年了，我還有强烈的讀書慾望，但我是一個殘廢的人了，一個肺病息者。我很艷羨你們申請助學的人，從不可能的環境中得到了熱心的記者們的呼籲，和社會至善人們的資助，可以繼續的上進，我為你們的前途歡忭，但我前日在「訪問記」裏見到有一位體質單薄的申請者，不禁記起了我的悲劇，這正好給申請者的一個參考。我家裏也很窮，全靠了五畝田地活的，比你們幸運一點的，就是親戚好，常常的資助我，得進了中學，後來又得了一位堂房伯父的幫助，終算進了高中，將在畢業的兩年，預備進中央政治學校，那裏是不要一切費用的。於是日夜的用功，每夜非十二點睡覺不可，疲倦的時候，拚命的飮紅茶，頗有效騐，所以像化學，物理，是沒有一個字不給我讀熟的，但這樣的支持了兩月，終於身上起了變化，前瘦固不免，胸部時時的覺酸痛並且還失眠，我先天本來不甚佳，所以到了第三個月，得了怕人的吐血症，整大口的吐，每次終要一痰盂，從此漸漸不起了，就停了學，當時伯父把我叫了去，在他家裹，幫動些文件的事，還僥倖不為生活所迫，苟延到現在，但這命運是悲慘的呵。</p>
<p>勤讀是要緊的，但體格也同樣的重要，我見到好多同學，勤讀了許多年，後來都有了肺病，使每個為之失望，痛惜。</p>
<p>申請助學的同學們，我想都是優秀的人才，但快快注意你們的體格，不要作我這樣笨讀的自斵。讀每一本書的時候，做札記很有幫助的，數學祗耍心思靈活而多做，……處理功課，望以興趣加之，我們精力必須有適當的分配，身心要有相宜的調劑，讀書到若干時候，運動請千萬不要忽略，散散步，打打拳，最為有益，廢了自己的身體，像廢了自己的學業一樣的使人失望，你們更是艱難的苦子弟，營養是說不上，同時這裏有許多人的熱誠寄托在你們的身上，萬不可使人失望，所以注意學業之外，也須注意你的身體。</p>
<p>我記起了吳稚暉先生的學生三大要素：</p>
<p>（一）Bright愉快。</p>
<p>（二）Usefnl有用。</p>
<p>（三）Honest誠實。</p>
<p>愉快是重耍的，無論如何的窮蹇迫着我們，許多成人的歷史吿訴我們，窮困是策勵我們上進的鞭子。</p>
<p>（酬移助學金）</p>
<p>編者按：筆者曾見過許多同學們呈繳本報的助學金申請書，大都凄切地叙述一已身世及求學志願，更有諸位先生的實地調查報告：窮處一隅，鶉衣百結，一種學子悲酸之狀，眞悽絕鏖實，予我以無上的感動，杜甫有云：「安得廣厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士俱歡顏」，不過是同病相憐，無能為力耳；然而在嗚咽之餘，却得到一種莫明的安慰：在窮困中才能上進，所謂置之死地而浚生，諸位淸寒學子的志願甚宏，如百折不撓，必能成功，舜何人也，予何人也，有為者亦若是。惟在此奮鬥過程中，願如何排除萬難，善養吾浩然之氣。諸同學的物質環境已盡現於諸位先生眼間筆底，其精神上的苦悶，則恐非親歷者不能道其萬一。諸同學申述時大都失聲痛哭，無怪其然，然而千萬請在平時保持胸襟之樂觀，種種物質上如營養不良不足，居處汚濁狹隘，已不及於人，心理上的苦悶，更會破壞身體的健康，由此而陷於精神上的病態，則難矣了。有健全之身體方有健全之頭腦，願三思之。在單純的苦學歷桿中，亦應如此。古人懸梁刺股，囊螢映雪，傳為美談，但請問如無强壯之身體，加以適度的勞助，精神的修養，其苦幹精神祇足與病魔紋纏綿而已，那可實現他的理想？新塘君所云，就是他以前不知體格訓練所致，「一心只讀眼前書，兩耳不開窗外事」，方法太舊，流弊極多，務請同學同時注意勞作與修養的必要，方可瑧茲完滿的佳境。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>那個人不就答話，先用很滑稽的神氣，向梅寳混身打量了一陣。</p>
<p>「怎麼不行啊？她有的是一雙手，祇要拿得起戒方，下得很勁打自己不心痛的孩子。當先生有什麽不成呢？」</p>
<p>說得梅寳也笑了，同時她已從這個中年人態度滑稽，言語可笑的兩點上，記起他就是三四年前，到樟樹屯來看過他們的那位趙伯父了。</p>
<p>趙伯父似乎已來了好幾天了，這一次居然還帶了許多鄉下買不到的東西，和一大包留着不曾坼開的西洋糖，雖然他自己穿的衣服還是像上次一樣的破舊。這一晚，因為梅寳也打城裏帶回了一些食物，再加上一籠新蒸的水餃，和小狗子做的幾個炒菜，所以誰都吃得很高興；秋海棠父女兩個都給趙玉崑灌了好幾杯五茄皮，他自己更和小狗子兩個沒命似的搶着吃喝，直到他所帶來的最後兩瓶五茄皮也一起喝空，才肯把手裏擎着的杯筷放下去。</p>
<p>「老二，你這樣天坍不問的脾氣，看來是到老也不能改啦！」</p>
<p>秋海棠站在靠牆的一邊，一面看小狗子和梅寳收拾杯盤，一面向玉崑含着笑說。</p>
<p>「這樣不好嗎？不然，我怎麽能天天嘻嘻哈哈的像過新年一樣呢？」玉崑脚步踉蹌地打板櫈上站起來。「今晚與緻很好，我還得上村外去繞幾個圈子咧！」（一八五）</p>
<h3>讀社評</h3>
<p>— 李家霖</p>
<p>靑年必修</p>
<p>今日的上海，有許多地方，充滿了糜爛，汚濁。</p>
<p>靑年在課餘所進修的不是桃角的報道，便是灰色的新聞，一般的讀物是太糟了。但我們要在今日的大報紙上找一找我們靑年需要的讀品。毫無疑意的，社評就是其中主要的一個，可是我知道天天讀它的人，恐怕為數不多，因為還是一件比較枯燥的工作。</p>
<p>我們學校裹的陳老師，他在暑期中，仍舊替我們義務補習，他可囑我們讀社評，暫時指定天天讀申報社評，陳老師說：社評中有很多極好的材料，這種材料，普通時候去搜集搜集，倒不是一件容易的事，而且社評的文學價値，也很可貴，對於成語的應用，詞句的結構，却有頗可愜意之處，尤其是能切題。</p>
<p>至於我們讀社評，最大的收穫是甚麼呢？那就是讀了它，可以使我們多明瞭目下的國際局勢，我們曉得社評中，評論國際局勢、評論得相當透澈、見解也相當的高超；於今世界多事之秋，我們不是愚人，不是盲人，豈能毫不關心今日國際局勢的演變，老實說，國際局勢的演變，和我們國家，我們本身，都有莫大的利害關係，我眞痛心有一般所謂高等華人，所謂知識靑年，他們對於甚麼桃色報道啊！灰色新聞啊，非常的關心，但若是你和他們談談現今的國際局勢，他們會牛頭不對馬嘴地，瞎扯上一大堆，或者他們不高興時候，他們也許要對你說，他們不願意漫談時事。</p>
<p>最後，我要說，我並不願意攻擊那些漠不關心世界局勢的人們，不過我勸大家讀社評，尤共是靑年們，我相信，我這動機總不能算壞吧！</p>

<p>乙：不見得，不見得。</p>

<p>乙：我想最好能够入政界裏去混混。</p>
<p>甲：不錯！我也是這個意思，你看政府裹的大老那一個不是文學家出身……現在老兄一定讀了好久，快要畢業了吧。</p>
<p>乙：不！今天上午我正在應該校的入學考試，大概錄取是不生問題的。</p>

<h3>菊國春秋</h3>
<p>— 鄧小閒</p>
<p>（一）　通天敎主桃李盈門　（上）</p>
<p>話說北國梨園行有一位通天敎主，那就是誰人不知那個不曉的王瑤卿老闆。講到王瑤卿，可以稱得起是一代名伶，當年他和譚大王叫天搭配，眞是譽滿大江南北，論藝術他的玩藝兒委實有獨到的地方，尤其是演旗裝戲和刀馬旦戲，眞為一般人所不及。近十數年來，瑤卿年事已高，而且限於嗓音，所以不復粉墨登塲，而以敎徒自娛。瑤卿的徒弟本來就有不少，近十年來旣以敎徒為業，一般人復紛粉拜入王氏門牆，於是古瑁軒上（瑤卿自號古瑁軒）桃季盈門，弟子之衆，為數不可勝計。因此同行送給他一個一通天敎主」的銜頭，有人說這「通天敎主」四個字除去上面所說的原因以外，還包含着兩種意思：一則就是說他肚子寬，玩藝兒會得多，法術無邊；還有一層是說他雖然法術無邊，但係左道旁門，所以稱他為「通天敎主」。否則為什麼不叫他「原始天尊」呢？遭話說得雖然有點那個，但事實上却也有理。</p>
<p>有人問我王瑤卿。到底有多少徒弟？在這一節中確有寫出來吿訴讀者的必要，據瑤卿自己統計有果香林，羅小寳，梅蘭芳，程硯秋，荀慧生，尙小雲，小翠花，王意芳，姜妙香，榮蝶仙，黃玉麟，馬艷冰，王芸芳，戴衍萬，吳蘭芳，郭效靑，李緝之，程玉菁，趙桐珊，李凌楓，金碧艷，李香勻，南鐵生，王盛意，孫成芳，蘇敬字，章小山，宋德珠，（以上男性）</p>

<h3>Roosevelt-Churchill Talks Concluded: Anglo-American Joint Declaration Issued: Wishing Invaded Nations to Restore Autonomous Governments, Resolving to Reduce Armaments and Maintain Lasting Peace; Beaverbrook to Visit the US to Discuss Details of Lend-Lease</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - Acting Prime Minister Attlee today made a statement that people have been eagerly awaiting. President Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Churchill, representing the British government, met at sea. Officials from both governments accompanied them, including senior personnel from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The US President and the Prime Minister held several meetings, considering the danger posed to world civilization by the military control policies of the German Hitler government and its vassal governments. They also stated the steps that Britain and the US should take in response to this danger. Both sides agreed to issue the following joint declaration:</p>
<p>The US President and the British Prime Minister, having met, believe that some common principles of their national policies should be stated: (1) Neither country seeks aggrandizement, territorial or other; (2) Neither country desires to see any territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; (3) They respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them; (4) They will endeavor to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity; while respecting existing obligations; (5) They desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security; (6) After the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want; (7) Such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance; (8) They believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers. They believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments. Both sides also continued to study all issues stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act regarding the supply of arms to Britain and all countries actively resisting aggression. British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook will participate in this discussion and will travel to Washington to discuss the details with US officials, which will further include the issue of supplies to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - Acting Prime Minister and Lord Privy Seal Attlee's remarks tonight, in addition to being broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation's domestic and overseas programs, will also be rebroadcast in the Americas by the American Broadcasting System. The British Broadcasting Corporation will also broadcast this statement in various dialects and in foreign language broadcasts. United Press, London, 14th - Officials announced today that Churchill and his entourage of 23 people left England in great secrecy, so that even some of his party did not know their destination.</p>
<h3>Philippine Resident Commissioner to the US Broadcast Speech Advocating US Policy</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th - Philippine Resident Commissioner to the US, Elisa Ysalte, broadcast to the entire United States last night, saying that the Filipino people are deeply aware that unless democratic countries win in the current great war, they will never be able to realize their ideal of independence. The Philippine people have already decided to support the United States in any event. It is essential to maintain the status quo in the China Sea area. If we allow this area to be controlled by imperialist countries through appeasement, the efforts of the United States and other democratic countries to preserve the free world will be greatly harmed. At risk now is the free trade of the entire world and the export of important raw materials to the United States.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Churchill Write to Stalin Reaffirming Their Determination to Aid the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 14th - Reliable sources revealed today that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill jointly wrote to Stalin, expressing their admiration for the Soviet Union's position and reaffirming their determination to provide the Soviet Union with all possible assistance.</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister of State Kiichirō Hiranuma Assassinated: Assailant Claimed to Seek Autographed Calligraphy; Made an Appointment to Visit, Then Opened Fire; Hiranuma Injured While Pursuing the Assailant, Nishiyama, Who Was Apprehended</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 14th - Japanese Minister of State Kiichirō Hiranuma was assassinated at his private residence today, suffering a gunshot wound. Police announced the assailant's name as Nishiyama, 35 years old, who claimed to be seeking Hiranuma's autographed calligraphy and made an appointment to visit. Unexpectedly, he used a handgun to shoot.</p>
<p>Shot in the neck, Hiranuma, despite being injured, pursued the assailant to the gate, where the guards apprehended him. At 1:00 PM, the Emperor dispatched imperial physician Matsunaga to examine him, and he and the Empress jointly sent several baskets of fruit. Prime Minister Konoe and other senior government officials also visited Hiranuma's private residence. Police investigating the case did not allow newspapers to publish the matter until 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to Domei News Agency, the Tokyo District Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office announced that this attempted assassination occurred at 8:00 AM today at Hiranuma's home. The Prosecutor's Office reported that Ishiya visited Hiranuma at 8:00 AM. While the two were talking in the reception room of Hiranuma's home, Ishiya suddenly drew a</p>
<p>handgun and opened fire. The Prosecutor's Office did not disclose Hiranuma's condition. Hiranuma was appointed to form a cabinet on January 5, 1939, after the collapse of the first Konoe cabinet, but his cabinet also collapsed eight months later after the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. In Konoe's second cabinet, Hiranuma was appointed Minister of Home Affairs. In Konoe's third cabinet, Hiranuma remained in the cabinet as a Minister of State. Hiranuma, 76 years old, has long been known as "Japan's number one fascist" and is the leader of the reactionary patriotic organization Kokusuikai, and an opponent of all liberalism. However, when he took office as Prime Minister on January 5, 1939, and in recent conversations, Hiranuma often stated that political parties should be able to have a say in the government and that the wishes of the people should be respected. His friends said that his</p>
<p>change of heart was due to his advanced age. Hiranuma has always been single, which is rare in Japan, because arranging marriages for children is the most important obligation of Japanese parents. Hiranuma occasionally drinks, and he prefers Japanese sake to Western liquor. This is one aspect of Hiranuma's nationalistic tendencies, but he prefers to smoke British Westminster brand cigarettes instead of Japanese-made ones. Hiranuma came from a poor background and was born in Okayama Prefecture in northwestern Japan. In 1888, after graduating from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University, he entered the Ministry of Justice and rose through the ranks to become President of the Supreme Court. Although he held a</p>
<p>high position, he continued to study and teach law at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1907, the university awarded him a doctorate in law. In 1926, he was</p>
<p>granted the title of Baron. After Hiranuma became Minister of Justice, he entered the House of Peers. After receiving the title of nobility in 1926, he became Vice President of the Privy Council for ten consecutive years. The main reason why Hiranuma failed to become President of the Privy Council was his open opposition to Makino, the Emperor's top advisor. Makino was a liberal and was assassinated in the February 26 Incident in 1936. In the same year, Hiranuma was promoted to President of the Privy Council. Since then, Hiranuma has severed ties with the Kokusuikai. Several years ago, Hiranuma expressed his anti-Kokusuikai views, saying, "Fascism may be good in Italy, but I do not believe that fascism, communism, or Hitlerism is beneficial to Japan." Generally reliable sources said that Hiranuma</p>
<p>was shot in the eye, but the government refused to confirm this point this afternoon. Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, stated, "Hiranuma is an important figure in Japan today, so a thorough investigation must be conducted before a formal statement can be made to the press."</p>

<h3>Special Party Branch of the Aviation Commission Issues Letter to Compatriots: Japanese Air Force Suffered Heavy Losses in the Past Four Years; Calls on Compatriots Nationwide to Build a New Air Force</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Tomorrow, August 14th, is Air Force Day. The Special Party Branch and the Political Department of the Aviation Commission issued a letter to compatriots nationwide and a letter to overseas Chinese, calling on compatriots at home and abroad to build a new air force. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Special Party Branch and Political Department of the Aviation Commission issued a letter to compatriots nationwide for Air Force Day, stating in part: Our Air Force has been in existence for a full four years. During these four years, a total of 2,054 Japanese aircraft have been shot down and destroyed by us, and a total of 2,650 Japanese air force personnel have been captured and killed by us. Many coastal commercial ports have been occupied, and the capital has been moved from Nanjing to Chongqing. The Jiaoqiao airfield has also been trampled upon, but our young Air Force has not only not been destroyed, but has grown and developed. It has made progress in both equipment and technology. The Japanese are carrying out a planned aggression, an aggression that has taken place after the Air Force has been established for twenty years. But our Air Force was only recently established, and the war of resistance has not affected its rapid growth. We acknowledge the inferiority of the Chinese Air Force, but because of our flexible use, we have achieved some victories. Today, our dark period has passed. Now, in the war of resistance against aggression, the great democratic countries such as China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are completely on our side. There is no doubt that final victory will belong to us. However, the future environment requires the use of subjective conditions, and the final victory requires the struggle of self-reliance. What is this subjective condition? In terms of the Air Force, the first is to contribute money and effort to support the Air Force vigorously and effectively. The second is the construction of a new Air Force. The Chinese Air Force is determined to shed blood, but hopes that compatriots across the country will have a timely understanding and rise up to assist the government in order to quickly promote the establishment of a large Air Force.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Economic War in Asia</h3>
<p>During the First World War, the Asian nations, except for a few who participated in destructive activities, the Chinese and Japanese countries were fortunate to avoid being drawn into the vortex, so the virgin economic strength of Asia was preserved. Today, the World War is being re-enacted, and its roots can be deduced from the first outbreak. The sharpness of weapons and the dedication of soldiers have been improved and demonstrated. It has stimulated all Asian nations to choose a line and participate in the war. The peaceful and benevolent Asian nations are divided into carrying spears and waiting for the arrival of death. Is this self-inflicted, or is it a liquidation of natural competition, and must all mankind go through this stage before reaching the other side? Regardless of how this matter develops, it will be difficult for the Asian people to maintain the status quo and order before the war, and this is what we should prepare for urgently.</p>
<p>Asia's abundant resources surpass the rest of the world, and our country is blessed with innate savings that everyone knows, but unfortunately, it has not been developed and utilized in time, resulting in long-standing attraction for foreign powers. This is why foreign aggression has become increasingly serious and will be completely resolved in the great war.</p>
<p>Recently, the Nazis divided the world into four self-sufficient countries based on the current distribution of economic resources: the Nazis rule all of Europe and Africa, the Soviet Union rules Central Asia and Siberia, the United States rules North and South America, and Japan rules the entire coastline of East Asia. This kind of arrogant dream should be dismissed, but it shows the goal of competing for economy at a glance. Recently, the South Pacific has shown a sword-drawing posture, which is on the verge of breaking out, which is enough to show that countries have been unbearable and will resort to force to solve the problem. What do human beings want to obtain from Asia? Let's try to say it.</p>
<p>The main resources of Asia that the Western countries rely on to maintain production include silk, tungsten, antimony, rubber, tin, manganese, etc. The United States uses about half of them. US steel, canned food, automobiles, and farm implement manufacturing plants require huge amounts of tin, and the production of tin must first transport Asian raw tin to the United Kingdom or the Netherlands for refining before transporting it to the United States. If all tin-producing areas are occupied by the Japanese army or the South Pacific route is cut off by the Japanese army, the US military industry will be greatly hit and will be shut down, because there is no effective remedy at present. Manganese and antimony also rely entirely on the supply of Asia. Although Cuba and Brazil have a slight production, they are of no avail, and there are no substitutes, so they are must-contend national defense raw materials. This is why the Burma Road has become an important international transportation line. As for tungsten and silk, there are substitutes, which are not a problem in the United States, and the United States can use this point to attack Japan. If the United States does not buy Japanese silk and then prohibits the export of oil to Japan, it will be enough to give Japan a heavy blow. Regarding the supply of rubber, Mexico and Brazil have a continuous supply, and there is no danger of interruption in the United States.</p>
<p>Now, what is the purpose of Japan's southward advance? Some commentators believe that Japan's coveting of the Dutch East Indies is to seize its large output of rubber, tin, and mineral oil to enrich its military raw materials, but in fact, it is not entirely the case. Vietnam and Thailand are both rubber-producing areas, each producing about 50,000 tons per year, and they can jointly produce 100,000 tons per year. Japan's military needs will not exceed 50,000 tons at most, so the output of one country is enough to supply Japan's consumption, and there is no need to search for it in the East Indies. Also, the tin production of the two countries is also enough to meet Japan's military needs. However, mineral oil is a natural specialty of the East Indies, and the output of the two countries is extremely small. This is one of the purposes of Japan's southward advance, which is undoubtedly. At the same time, intercepting the only international route for the export of tin, antimony, and manganese to hit the United States must also be one of its purposes. The United States can stop Japan from taking mineral oil from the East Indies, and Japan can also make a big fuss about preventing the United States from seizing its tin. As for the tin, antimony, and manganese produced on the Asian continent, it must be easily plundered by the Japanese army, and the United States will feel more difficult to fight back. The situation of the competition for economic resources in the South Pacific is probably like this.</p>
<p>Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and is endowed with the right time, place, and people, but unfortunately, it has not been used to its full potential, resulting in the covetous gaze of strong neighbors, which is indeed a pity. However, we not only have no stingy thoughts, but also advocate cooperation with countries that share the same goals to develop our country's resources for the common enjoyment of mankind. The point we strive for is that economic cooperation must be mutually beneficial and not one-sided. If we take aggressive actions and seize them by force, we will never tolerate it and must give them a powerful blow.</p>
<h3>The United States Transports 800,000 Tons of Supplies to China, Part of the US Aid Program to China; Cargo Transportation on the Burma Road Can Be Increased</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to sources in charge here, the United States is currently transporting 800,000 tons of supplies to China, which is part of the US aid program to China. US transportation experts stated after inspecting the Burma Road that the current cargo tonnage passing through the road can be doubled or even tripled. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Students Studying in the United States Allowed to Travel by US</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Due to the increasingly tense international situation, the US government ordered the President Shipping Company, which sails to the Far East, to prohibit ordinary Chinese passengers from traveling to the United States. Those holding official passports must also be handled by the company at its discretion. Only those holding diplomatic passports are not restricted. Many Chinese students who were going to study in the United States this summer were stranded in Hong Kong and could not depart. After learning of this matter, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the US side. It has now received a reply from the US Embassy in Hong Kong stating that the US State Department has instructed the shipping company to allow Chinese students to buy tickets and take ships to the United States as usual.

<h3>Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation: August 8th to 14th</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Weekly war situation, August 8th to 14th, the spokesman of the Military Commission said that this week the Japanese Air Force suddenly carried out long-term and extensive bombing in the cities of China's rear, especially in China's capital. According to the Japanese spokesman, its purpose is to achieve various fantasies and to make China submit: (1) Destroy the productivity of China's vast rear; (2) Attack the tenacity of China's anti-Japanese people; (3) Shake the stability and strengthening power of Chongqing, etc. The rest said that not only is there no tactical or strategic significance, but this kind of behavior is enough to show their boredom and entrapment in the quagmire. The various fantasies of Japan cannot be realized, but instead give China various gains, that is, in the spiritual aspect: (1) Exercise our physique to make it agile; (2) Strengthen our hatred of the enemy; in fact, (1) The Japanese side lost more aircraft, gasoline and personnel, and the Chinese side lost less houses and roads; (2) All the work on the Chinese side is still proceeding as usual and has not been affected in the slightest. It can be imagined that the newspapers that are clearly visible are still published every day as usual, and all other institutions can be imagined. It is a dream to solve the war in this way. As for the Japanese army, in the battle northeast of Yichang, except for a small part of the Japanese army near Caojiayu that was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese, the rest have returned to their original positions. In this battle, a total of more than 5,000 Japanese were killed or wounded, and a large number of spoils of war were captured. It was the first victory of the Chinese army in western Hubei since the summer of this year. In the battle in the Jingzhou and Shashi area, Hao Xue was completely recovered by the 10th, and the Japanese retreated north to Cenhekou. The Japanese in Xinkou and Jinjiabu were also defeated and retreated north, abandoning a large number of military supplies along the way. On the south bank of Taihu Lake, a Chinese unit captured the Japanese stronghold of Xinchen Town northwest of Jiaxing on the evening of the 8th, killing and wounding more than 400 Japanese. The Chinese army captured 5 light machine guns, 148 rifles, and many other spoils of war. On the evening of the 6th, a Chinese unit in northern Hunan attacked the Japanese near Linxiang and bombed a Japanese army train, killing and wounding more than 300 Japanese and burning more than 400 barrels of Japanese gasoline. Other scattered war situations are omitted. (14th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Re-attack Chongqing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Yunnan Provinces All Attacked, Losses Everywhere Extremely Minor</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Three waves of Japanese bombers, totaling one hundred and seventeen planes, flew over Chongqing for two and a half hours today, the seventh consecutive day of bombing. The attacks over the past few months have reached twenty-six times. The Japanese planes today still focused on the western city walls and the area between the already destroyed press club. The press club has been bombed repeatedly for two years, resulting in its destruction yesterday. A village one mile upstream in a safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River, as well as areas on the north bank of the Yangtze River and Jiangbei, one mile from the urban area, were all bombed by Japanese planes. The first wave of Japanese planes, totaling sixty-three, were divided into small groups and flew from all directions to bomb Chongqing for ten minutes. Three fires broke out, but were quickly extinguished. The Haitang Temple (transliteration) area near the safe zone was also bombed by twenty-three Japanese planes. A Chinese military spokesman said that these continuous air raids clearly show that the Japanese army needs to show combat performance in China due to its plan to advance north.

<h3>Representatives of Four Countries, Britain, the United States, Australia, and Canada, Hold a Meeting on the Far East Situation; The U.S. Approves Treaties to Enhance Friendship</h3>
<p>United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: British, American, Australian, and Canadian officials held a meeting on the Far East situation yesterday at the office of Secretary of State Hull. Key figures at the meeting included Duff Cooper, the former British Minister of Information, who is now going to Singapore to take up a new position. The meeting was originally for the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to exchange ratifications of the three treaties concluded to promote peace and friendship among the aforementioned countries. After the completion of the mutual recognition ceremony, they discussed Japan's actions in the Far East and other matters. It is reported that Hull and the Canadian Chargé d'Affaires to the U.S., the New Zealand representative (represented by the British Ambassador Halifax), and the Australian Minister to the U.S. had previously entered into an agreement to establish a committee to handle disputes.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington dispatch, 14th: Former British Minister of Information Duff Cooper, on his way to take office in the Far East, passed through here and met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Afterwards, he told people that Britain is prepared to cooperate with the United States on parallel lines around the world. Cooper only said regarding the tense situation in the Far East that Britain feels it cannot allow Japan to act arbitrarily in the Pacific. Cooper also participated in the ceremony when representatives of the four countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, formally exchanged the signed texts of treaties to promote peace. This treaty replaces the old treaty of 1914 and stipulates that each country will organize committees to resolve various issues, instead of being handled by a single committee composed of Britain and the United States. This treaty was negotiated last year and is now formally signed.</p>
<p>United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: In response to the question of what influence the Soviet Union has on the Far East situation, Duff Cooper replied, "The Soviet Union has always been helpful in the global situation (the Far East is also a part)."</p>
<p>Reuters Melbourne dispatch, 14th: The Australian War Cabinet discussed various important policy matters with the leaders of the three armed services yesterday and continued to discuss the situation in the Far East.

The procedures for implementing the Cabinet's proposal that Australian Prime Minister Menzies should go to London were also extensively discussed. It is expected that the War Cabinet will continue to consider this matter at today's meeting, and a resolution will probably be submitted separately to both houses of Parliament. At present, the general focus of the Labor Party is on the Labor Party conference during the parliamentary session, but the vast majority of the Labor Party is expected to support this resolution.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Batavia dispatch, 14th: Authoritative sources say that the Dutch feel that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a direct threat to the Dutch East Indies. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to restore normal business relations with Japan. The Japanese announcement that the Dutch-Japanese economic negotiations have reopened is incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Burma Prepares to Resist Aggression; Sends Personnel to Chongqing to Study Air Defense</h3>
<p>Reuters Rangoon dispatch, 14th: With the threat of war closing in on Burma's neighbors, the Burmese are now actively preparing to defend against attacks on Burmese territory. Burmese people generally say that if other countries endanger the lives and happiness of Burma's sixteen million people in their desire to contend for power and profit, then we will defend ourselves to the last person. We are not isolated and helpless. Burma is a country that reveres Buddhism and has religious ties with other countries in the Far East. Having not known war for sixty-three years, it now realizes that if its borders are invaded, then its religion will not be preserved. Those who covet Burma have been broadcasting special propaganda to Burma for months, but the Burmese always scoff at it, because in the eyes of the Burmese, those who violate the law and kill and plunder peaceful countries will be punished by heaven. When Governor of Burma Smith recently inspected various places, the chiefs of the border tribes welcomed him holding British flags and singing war songs, and swore to him that they were willing to die for freedom and promised to implement blackout regulations and accept other restrictions, and to organize guerrilla teams when necessary. The enthusiasm was extremely high. The attitude of the Burmese can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Reuters Rangoon dispatch, 14th: In order to further accelerate the progress of the air defense measures he has adopted, the Burmese Minister of Home Affairs has now decided to send one air defense officer, one medical officer, and one police officer to Chongqing for a week to study the actual bombing situation. The three members are Chief Administrative Officer Captain Tong Laine, Director of Medical Services of the Defense Force Aliason, and Rangoon Police Chief U Tong Aung.</p>

The modern equipment and weapons in the Indian army are all supplied by local Indian arsenals or shipped from overseas." General Wavell said that he was extremely satisfied with the recent inspection of the Northwest and the training of Indian troops. Wavell also said that "any enemy who tries to invade India within the realm of possibility will encounter our fierce obstruction."</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Talks; Contents Kept Secret; The "Tokyo Newspaper" Comments on the Situation, Saying It Has Reached a Serious Stage</h3>
<p>United Press Tokyo dispatch, 14th: The British Embassy here refuses to announce the contents of the recent talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda. When asked if the contents were about joint defense of the Dutch East Indies, officials said that this was a "new meeting" for us. The "Zhongwai Business Newspaper" criticized the actions of the United States over the past two weeks in a weekly commentary, saying that before a possible complete severance of relations, an absolute embargo and the withdrawal of consuls are the only possible steps in the future. It also said that the United States had previously been unwilling to make a firm response to Japan's southward advance, but Washington has now decided to take firm action. Therefore, the situation has progressed to a serious stage. The newspaper commented on the domestic situation, saying, "The government must show the people of the country, tell them the country's position and how the people should act. Today, the government has reached a critical period and must not hide the truth from the people for fear of divulging the country's strength to the world. Foreign countries already know Japan's strength, but the Japanese people do not." The "National News" vehemently criticized the ABCD countries for attempting to stop Japan's "co-prosperity" activities, and warned the United States that if the latter takes any further steps against Japan in any form, the relations between the U.S. and Japan will undergo the most severe change. It also said that Britain has been exhausted by two years of war, so it deliberately misinterprets the situation in national defense. It also said, "The New Order in East Asia" should be interpreted as "requiring very little self-defense," so the United States should not be used by Britain to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Britain.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented U.S. War Games Held on the West Coast</h3>

The fleet continued to sail south, and in Seattle, McChord Airfield and half of the defending air force were judged to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Britain Strengthens Far East Air Force; Warships Escort Ten Thousand Miles; A Large Number of Soldiers Arrive in Singapore</h3>
<p>Reuters London dispatch, 14th:</p>
<p>The British Air Ministry's Information Office recently stated that the convoys that have sailed to the Far East in the past few months have all arrived safely after a long journey of ten thousand miles, without the loss of a single person or plane due to enemy action. This is due to the proper protection of warships and aircraft along the way. These convoys carried thousands of soldiers to strengthen the British Air Force in the Far East. The second largest ship, which departed from a port in northern England in the past half month, arrived safely in Singapore a few days ago, without seeing any signs of enemy submarines or aircraft along the way. The voyage was as comfortable as before the war. Those who have now arrived in the Far East have not only replaced the soldiers whose tours of duty have expired, but also provided fresh troops needed for the airfields in Malaya and Burma. Most of them have been transferred from the British bomber and fighter squadrons and have full experience in air combat day and night, so they are of great help to the defense of the Far East.</p>

<h3>Soviet Communiqué Admits Withdrawal from Smolensk; Situation in Southern Ukraine Deteriorates; No Changes in Warfare in Other Areas</h3>
<p>TASS Moscow dispatch, 14th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued the war report for August 13th as follows: On the 13th, our army fought the enemy in the Kholm, Staraya Russa, Smolensk, and Velikiye Luki areas. A few days ago, our army withdrew from Smolensk. Our air force continued to strike the enemy. On the 12th, 43 enemy planes were destroyed, and we also lost 35 planes. On the Baltic front, our submarine sank a German oil tanker of 5,000 tons. Also, the Finnish radio station claimed that Soviet planes bombed Dobruja, which the Soviet official has absolutely denied.</p>
<p>Reuters London dispatch, 14th: There have been no major changes in the long Soviet front line, but the Soviets admit that the situation in southern Ukraine has deteriorated. In other areas, fierce fighting is continuing. Neither side has made significant favorable progress. Another place where the Germans claim progress is only north of Lake Peipsi. According to unconfirmed reports, German troops there have reached the Baltic Sea, cutting off Soviet traffic to Tallinn (the capital of Estonia). If this is true, then the German left wing will encounter strong resistance from isolated troops, and the German lines of communication will also be threatened. Tallinn itself is heavily defended, and the Soviet army can use it and Hango Island, across the Gulf of Finland, to completely control the narrow gulf. If Tallinn falls, then the situation of Hango Island will also be greatly threatened. There have been no changes in the war situation around Murmansk in the north or Kiev in the south. Although the German army, which is trying to cut off the ports of Odessa and Nikolaev, is currently advancing, the German side may not shift its main offensive force to this area. It is generally believed that the German army intends to trap the Soviet fresh troops in this area when it resumes its real offensive towards Moscow. It is believed that the number of Soviet troops in this area is not very large, because with the Black Sea under Soviet control, the German eastward advance does not seem to be advancing too far. Currently, the German army is still far from the Dnieper River. If it attacks the river, it will threaten the Don River coal-producing region, which is close to the important Soviet industrial center. It is believed that Odessa must have strong defenses, especially along the coast. The Soviet fleet is strong enough to control the Black Sea. In summary, the threat to Odessa now seems more imminent, but it must be understood that the German goal is not Odessa, but Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev.</p>
<h3>Germany Pressures Bulgaria to Send Troops to Participate in the Attack on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>TASS Bern dispatch, 14th: According to reliable sources, Germany has requested that Bulgaria send two divisions of "reliable" soldiers to the Eastern Front "in the name of volunteers." In Hitler's eyes, this method would allow Bulgaria to participate in the Hitler government's "anti-communist crusade" without having to declare war on the Soviet Union. It is reported that Bulgaria has not yet responded to this request. The Bulgarian authorities explained to Germany that Bulgaria's non-participation in the war could give Germany more food aid, so it is best not to participate. The Bulgarian authorities believe that if Bulgaria participates in the war, it will inevitably lead to internal divisions.</p>
<h3>Germany Plots to Seize Two Black Sea Ports to Seize Large Quantities of Food There</h3>
<p>Reuters Moscow dispatch, 14th: Regarding the German claim that the German army is advancing rapidly in Ukraine, the Soviet military responded yesterday that "nothing important happened on the front line on Tuesday." If something very important had happened on the front line, the Soviet side would not have said this, and yesterday's Soviet communique did not mention new place names, indicating that the main German force had not made progress, but this does not mean that the German vanguard would not risk attacking again, because the German army may try to seize the Black Sea port of Nikolaev (70 miles northeast of Odessa) in an attempt to seize large quantities of stored grain there. Currently, Nikolaev has not suffered a serious threat. If it does, then there is every reason to believe that the Soviet side will follow Stalin's policy and transfer the stored grain inland. In any case, the grain has now been harvested. If the Soviet side needs to make a strategic withdrawal, it may abandon a part of the agricultural land in Ukraine and defend the strong positions in the Dnieper River Bay. From an industrial point of view, protecting the Dnieper River is very important.</p>
<p>Reuters London dispatch, 14th: The German and Soviet war reports on the Eastern Front are both silent on the development of the war. The Soviet communiqué said that there was nothing to report, while the Germans still said that the war is proceeding according to plan. Currently, the new war seems to be concentrated in Ukraine. The Berlin communiqué said that the German and Romanian allied forces are now attacking General Patton's troops. German radio said that it has reached the Black Sea coast between Odessa and the Bug River estuary. The latest Soviet communiqué declared that on the evening of August 13, nothing of importance had been reported on any front. The Soviet Air Force cooperated with the army to severely attack enemy mechanized units, infantry, and airfields.</p>
<p>Havas Berlin dispatch, 14th: The official has just issued a communiqué saying that the German army has reached the Black Sea coast between the Soviet port of Odessa and the Bug River estuary.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Will No Longer Recognize the Vichy Pétain Government; If the Axis Powers Invade Africa, Weigand's Resistance; The U.S. Will Implement the Lend-Lease Act to Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: Yesterday, the U.S. will provide assistance, but conversely, if General Weygand can separate from the Vichy government and does not cooperate with it, and if the French forces led by General Weygand do not resist when the Axis powers of Europe invade Africa, then the United States will resume recognizing the Vichy government, and will instead recognize the "Free France" led by de Gaulle, and will implement the Lend-Lease Act. He will be recognized as the head of the honorary Free France movement. General Weygand is afraid that he will not give Pétain and Admiral Darlan military cooperation in order to attach himself to the Axis powers, because General Weygand left Vichy and went to Africa when Pétain announced cooperation with Germany. It is also learned that if Weygand immediately surrenders to Germany, the United States will seize Martinique and other French territories in the Americas with other Western Hemisphere countries.</p>
<p>All United Press Washington dispatch, 14th: Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that he is waiting for information from U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy before issuing a statement on future U.S.-French relations, and fully analyzing Vichy's new actions. When asked, Hull refused to discuss this speculation. This question believes that if full cooperation" to the Axis powers in the invasion of French territories in Africa has been established, then the United States is prepared to take appropriate action. In answering questions from the press about rumors that the United States is considering seizing Martinique Island, Hull said that Washington has no information on this issue other than the German rumors.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch, 13th, Washington: After French Head of State Pétain gave a broadcast speech yesterday, most members of both houses of Congress here advocated severing diplomatic relations with France. The American newspapers also did not like Pétain's speech, and strongly stated that if the naval bases on the coast of French West Africa were allowed to be used by Germany, it would pose a serious danger to the United States. However, the official side remained silent on this and refused to comment, only saying that the government authorities would have to reopen negotiations with the French government on the issue of French Martinique Island and French territories in the Western Hemisphere in order to obtain assurances that they would not be used by forces hostile to the United States.</p>
<p>Pétain Establishes Political Tribunal Havas dispatch, 13th, Vichy: According to well-informed sources here, Head of State Pétain announced yesterday when he broadcast that he would establish a political tribunal, but this does not mean that the Lyon Supreme Court will stop trying those responsible for the "disaster of the country," because its purpose is to enable Head of State Pétain to quickly convict all political criminals in the future. Even before the formal verdict, the Head of State has the power to punish them, because the Head of State is the supreme judge. According to the establishment of the Lyon Supreme Court a year ago, it was set up to try various ministers who had been derelict in their duties. Former Prime Minister Daladier, former Commander-in-Chief of National Defense Gamelin, former Prime Minister Blum, former Minister of the Interior Mantel, and former Minister of Aviation Cote are all among those accused, and are still in prison. In short, the political tribunal decided to be established this time is roughly a consultative body, and does not conflict with the Lyon Supreme Court. It is heard that the person in charge will prepare his opinion letter on October 15 and submit it to Head of State Pétain for review.</p>
<h3>Darlan Issues Letter to the Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch, 14th, Vichy: After Darlan took over as Deputy Chief of State and Minister of National Defense, he recently issued a letter to the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, saying that he was honored to be entrusted with this important task by the Head of State, and would do his best to perform his duties with impartiality and treat all officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force equally, regardless of rank. Head of State Pétain has dedicated himself to the country, and with his great wisdom and courage, he has opened up a path for us. I will naturally follow this path, and all my comrades must take the four words of glory, motherland, discipline, and character as the norm.</p>
<p>International News Service Washington dispatch, 14th: Secretary of State Hull yesterday denied that Washington was about to take action on Martinique Island. Germany claimed that as a result of Vichy's cooperation with the Axis powers, the U.S. was prepared to seize the French West Indies. Hull commented on the news, saying that the German rumors are the only basis for the news. (Authoritative sources in Berlin claimed last night that the U.S. will seize Martinique Island on the grounds that French-German cooperation will threaten the Western Hemisphere. The same source strongly stated that France and the Axis powers will strongly denounce British and American joint intervention in European affairs. German-French peaceful cooperation can harm the United States, which is generally considered "laughable." At the same time, well-informed sources said that Washington is now considering severing commercial relations with French North Africa. According to the U.S.-French agreement, the U.S. can transport various necessities, including oil, to French territories, but once the commercial agreement is cancelled, U.S. relations with France will be on the verge of collapse.</p>
<h3>Japan Implements Mobilization Law; Prices Greatly Affected; Stocks and Shipping are Under Control; Similar Orders in North China</h3>
<p>United Press Tokyo dispatch, 14th: Since the National Mobilization Commission implemented four articles of the Imperial Mobilization Law, Japan today has officially entered the wartime foundation. The four bills are about controlling the stock market, various shipping, the government's official pricing of corporate bonds and prices, and controlling prices regulations, which will replace the price regulation regulations of last September. There are 7,000 kinds of goods affected by it. The move to control stock prices is to avoid the collapse of market prices in order to facilitate the slight call of capital for the expansion of factories. The detailed rules for controlling prices have not been announced, but this regulation is to prevent poor distribution and hoarding. As for the regulations on controlling shipping, they enable government agencies to have direct and complete guidance on domestic commercial shipping. This new shipping management includes regulations on all shipping-related charges. The "Manchukuo" also has a mobilization bill similar to that of Japan. Often, after the first step is implemented in Tokyo, "Manchukuo" will follow suit. North China also has similar economic orders to cooperate with Japan in establishing a "Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<h3>British Planes Bomb Italy Fiercely; Chemical Plant</h3>
<p>Reuters Cairo dispatch, 14th: Since the British Air Force has stepped up its attacks on Germany and northern France, its scope of activities has been expanding day by day. On Sunday, it even flew to southern Italy and fiercely bombed a chemical plant in Jing Luotoni. According to a communiqué issued by the British Air Force Command in the Middle East here, when British planes attacked this area in southern Italy, they dropped many bombs, hitting the storage depot and severely damaging it. The entire target caught fire and the flames soared into the sky. Other British planes destroyed military buildings in Caliati. Several targets in the western Sineka area were also bombed by the British Air Force on Sunday night. After British planes bombed Gatzella Airfield, the results could not be clearly seen due to low clouds. Military buildings attacked in Badia caught fire, and the levee in Duna was also bombed and damaged. Also, on Sunday night, enemy planes flew over Malta and dropped bombs, causing minor material damage. British fighter planes intercepted them and shot down two enemy planes. On the same night, British bombers made a long-distance attack on the port of Tripoli, destroying buildings in the port and starting a fire near the power plant. British planes also fiercely strafed enemy motor vehicles on the nearby coastal highway. One British plane was lost in the above battles.</p>
<h3>Turkish Cabinet: Rumors of Reorganization, British Ambassador Hosts Turkish Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Hava Khan, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital:</p>
<p>Rumors of a cabinet reshuffle have been rife recently. It is said that the current Prime Minister, Seydan Ruogu, will resign, and Foreign Minister Samsala Zhuoge Lu will succeed him in forming a cabinet. As for the selection of the new foreign minister, it will likely be either the ambassador to Germany, Jie Laide, or the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Meinai Gezhuo Lu.</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital: British Ambassador Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Samsala Zhuoge Lu and four Turkish cabinet members last night.</p>
<p>Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from the Turkish capital: The British Ambassador recently delivered a letter to the Foreign Minister, stating that the British and Soviet declaration to Turkey has in no way altered the 1939 treaty, nor has it expanded the limits and obligations of this treaty. The meaning of the declaration is merely to reiterate the obligations to Turkey contained in the first clause of the treaty signed in October 1939.</p>
<h3>Germany Building Defense Works in Norway</h3>
<p>United Press, 10th – A dispatch from London: A senior Norwegian source told the United Press today that, according to reliable information received in London, German troops are actively building fortifications in Norway, and a large number of workers have been sent from Denmark and Germany. German troops are now stepping up their control over Norway. They anticipate that British or Allied forces may attack the German forces via the North Sea because a new front has been established on the Soviet-Finnish border. The accelerated construction of airfields and coastal defenses in Norway has been particularly noticeable in the past two weeks.</p>
<h3>US President Approves Establishment of Special Protection Force to Prevent Espionage</h3>
<p>Reuters, 14th – A dispatch from Washington:</p>
<p>President Roosevelt has approved a plan to establish a special protection force to defend naval facilities and prevent sabotage and espionage.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of a Visit with Indian Poet Laureate Tagore (I)</h3>
<p>— Xu Baoqian</p>
<p>The eighty-year-old Indian poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore passed away in Calcutta on the 17th of this month. The loss of this "wooden-tongued bell" of Eastern civilization is truly as stated in Chairman Chiang's condolence message. Two years ago, I had the opportunity to attend the World Christian Conference in India, and I was able to visit contemporary Indian celebrities such as Gandhi, Tagore, and Nehru. I was honored to be hosted by Tagore and stayed for two days at the International University he founded, where I had the opportunity to witness Tagore's demeanor, listen to his words, and visit the educational and rural improvement projects he held. I have always felt fortunate. Now, at the request of friends at the Shen Bao, I am writing a series of articles to introduce aspects of Tagore's life, writings, thoughts, and career.</p>
<p>The Initiation of the Visiting Group</p>
<p>The World Christian Conference was held in Madura, India, at the end of November of the 27th year of the Republic. Some of the Chinese representatives invited Ms. Lester, a British friend familiar with the situation in India and who had visited China several times, to initiate an international visiting group. More than ten people joined at that time, representing the nationalities of Britain, America, China, Japan, Canada, and South Africa (blacks). Mr. Kagawa Toyohiko, a prominent Japanese Christian, originally intended to join, but stopped due to matters, and changed to Murao. We left Madura and headed north on the morning of the 30th, and arrived in Wardha the next morning. After several miles, we reached Mahatma Gandhi's residence, named Swgaon. We left Wardha on the morning of January 28th, and arrived in Calcutta on the morning of the 4th. We arrived at Santiniketan (meaning "Abode of Peace") on the 7th, which is Tagore's residence and the location of the International University.</p>
<p>The Process of Visiting Tagore</p>
<p>The first impression of the International University run by Tagore was that it did not look like the site of an ordinary university, but a large forest. Ancient trees stood tall, and the environment was quiet. Only when we saw the buildings scattered everywhere and the groups of male and female students did we suddenly realize that this was a forest academy.</p>
<p>Tagore treated us with special courtesy. We lived in Western-style houses and ate Western food. This was very different from the way Gandhi entertained guests.</p>
<p>At 1:45 p.m. on the 7th, Tagore made an exception (it is said that Tagore's usual talk time is often at 5 p.m.) to give us a quarter of an hour of conversation. At that time, Tagore was already seventy-eight years old. Although his waist was slightly bent, his eyes were piercing, his spirit was high, his white hair hung down, his silver beard was long, he wore a silk robe, and his nose was high. We could not help but think of the demeanor of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy in the photographs. Our group sat around Tagore, asking him many questions about various aspects in a quarter of an hour. As far as I can remember, most of them focused on Tagore's attitude towards the national movement, his international thoughts, and the educational and rural work he had done himself.</p>
<p>Tagore frankly told us that he expressed deep sympathy for the national movement. He admired Gandhi's personality and ability to lead the masses. He also admired Nehru and regarded him as a "rising star." However, he said: He was already old, and he was a poet after all, so he could not contribute much to this great national liberation movement, which made him feel sorry.</p>
<p>Tagore also told us: Unfortunately, he was accused of the "bad name" of a poet, so people always thought that he did not pay attention to the practical problems of life. In fact, the education he ran was completely integrated with life. Moreover, the rural work he did was still pioneering, because at that time, the national movement led by Gandhi had not yet started to reform the rural areas.</p>
<p>Tagore also said: In his literary works, he advocated the liberation of the oppressed classes and started decades ago. The dance drama we can see tonight is a work from Tagore's middle age. Tagore adapted this script based on the story of Ananda being tempted by a demon girl in the Buddhist scriptures. He placed the demon girl in several classes. Finally, she and Ananda were bathed in the Buddha's light and gained salvation. In this way, it demonstrates Tagore's idea of liberating civilians.</p>
<p>Tagore advocated the harmony of Eastern and Western cultures and advocated international peace. He tried his best to oppose all aggressive wars. He deeply admired the inherent advantages of Japanese culture. However, he was deeply dissatisfied with Japan's recent trend towards militarism. When the August 13th Incident occurred, tens of thousands of innocent Chinese people were bombed, which aroused dissatisfaction among the public opinion of India. Noguchi Ujo, a famous Japanese poet, knew Tagore. Driven by patriotism, he wrote to Tagore in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic to defend the government's actions in invading China. This caused Tagore's dissatisfaction. Noguchi was greatly disappointed by Tagore's reply, which was straightforward, and wrote to Tagore again in August. After receiving the letter, Tagore was very disappointed in Noguchi and severely rebuked him in his reply. Tagore printed the four letters in which he and Noguchi debated and distributed one copy to each of us. After reading it, I asked Murao, a Japanese who was traveling with me. According to the answer, it must have been written by someone else for Tagore, and the wording can be said to be skillful.</p>
<p>Visiting Tagore's Career</p>
<p>At 3:30 p.m. on the 7th, we were invited to attend Tagore's grand social gathering to entertain an Indian prince. It is said that the prince's father was a close friend of Tagore and had donated a lot of money to the cause run by Tagore. At the meeting, we met three Chinese students: one named Wang Junjing (Ms.), who came to study nearby because she lived in Myanmar; one named Shi Xiulu (from Jiangsu); and one named Shi Fazhou, both of whom had been ordained as monks and had lived in Ceylon for a year. We met in a foreign land, and naturally had another kind of emotion. After the meeting, we visited the International University campus and internal facilities (see details below). From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the 7th, the male and female students of the International University performed Tagore's song and dance drama for a certain prince. The name of the drama is Chadra, and the content describes the story of Ananda being tempted by a demon girl and being rescued by the supernatural power of the Tathagata Buddha. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The United States Has Completed Necessary Preparations and Has Determination in the Far East; Major Changes Are Expected in the Spring of Next Year; The Foundation for World Peace Has Now Been Laid</h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Washington published in the Continental Daily News yesterday, the United States has fully prepared its naval and air forces and is determined to curb Japan's new adventures in the Far East. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries is on the verge of erupting. If the Soviet Union can resist the German army until the winter of the year, and China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands work together to defeat Japan in the spring of next year, then Britain will be able to transfer its forces in the Far East to Europe to eliminate Hitler's forces. Then, at the end of 1942, there is hope for the realization of world peace. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the 12th almost explained the ultimate goal of the United States.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News published a special telegram from Washington on the 13th yesterday, saying that the relationship between the United States and Japan today has reached the point of eruption. According to well-informed sources, the United States seems to have decided early on to fully prepare its naval and air forces to curb Japan's new expansion in the Far East. Today, the United Kingdom and the United States are completely consistent in policy and action. If Japan advances militarily to the south or north, Japan will inevitably encounter armed sanctions.</p>
<p>The United States Arranges for Both Offense and Defense</p>
<p>According to qualified observers of the Far East problem here, in the past two years, the US policy has been quite disappointing to most Chinese people. However, this policy has allowed the United States to calmly arrange military affairs and allow Britain to gain a more solid position in the skies of Western Europe, so as to prevent the Axis powers from winning victories in various parts of the world. Two years ago, the United States was completely unprepared. The actions of Congress were very slow, and the attitude of the public was indifferent. Any drastic measures were inappropriate at that time. Two years ago, Singapore and Myanmar were not prepared, and the Atlantic base that President Roosevelt exchanged for the US destroyer also lacked facilities for both offensive and defensive purposes. If the United States and Japan were at war at that time, the small number of American aircraft that Britain could obtain would be intercepted, which would be enough to contribute to Britain's failure and enable Japan to win a possible victory. However, today's situation is very different. Because Germany's war against the Soviet Union has consumed a large amount of manpower and machinery, it is believed that if Hitler can be contained until this winter, the democratic countries will surely win.</p>
<p>Division of Labor and Cooperation to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>The observer told reporters that if Germany is frustrated, the "grand strategy" of the global war will be to attack Japan, and China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands will cooperate to defeat Japan in the coming spring. If this strategy can be completed, Hitler's situation will be hopeless. Japan's threat has been removed, and the situation in the Pacific can be stabilized. Then, China will receive aircraft supplies from the Philippines, Hawaii, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. At this time, China's responsibility is to sweep away the Japanese troops trapped in mainland China. Under these circumstances, the entire military force of the United Kingdom in Singapore, the Dutch-Indian military force, and the US Far East Fleet can be transferred to the Atlantic to destroy Hitler's positions in Europe. The observer firmly believes that Soviet Russia will be able to contain the German army until this winter, and before the coming spring, it will be able to weaken Japan's strength and its threat. If these major aspects can be realized, the end of 1942 will come with peace.</p>
<p>Hull's Statement is Firm</p>
<p>Although the Congress and the American people have no explanation, the enthusiastic support for the war against Japan far exceeds the support for participating in a purely European war. Most Americans still believe that the European war is a purely European affair, so they do not pay much attention to Hitler's Western Hemisphere plan. However, the general American people, who understand Japan, are deeply convinced that Japan is not an ideal ally. Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull's statement on the purpose and policy of the United States was not used as a bait for Japan or other countries, but was a final summary of the US policy on its own purpose. This policy has always been based on maintaining peace in a rational and appropriate way. Approaching the point of entering the war, this statement is almost a clear statement of the US goal.</p>
<h3>Former Site of British Intelligence Agency Prepared to Be Relocated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese owner of Greenland Building, No. 2 Beijing Road, notified the British Intelligence Agency in the building to relocate. According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the British Intelligence Agency recently stated that although the Japanese owner has not ordered them to move out, they have been notified to relocate when the lease expires. Therefore, the British Intelligence Agency is now making preparations for this.</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that Shanghai has been rumored that the Cathay Land Company has sold Hamilton House to a certain Sino-Japanese business, and that the sale of Riverside Apartments is also being negotiated. A certain member of the Cathay Land Company firmly denied this.</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations Hold Emergency Relief in the Nanshi Area; Blockade Status Not Removed; Relief Area Expanded</h3>
<p>The famine in Nanshi is full of cries. All charity organizations are deeply concerned. The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association on Tongfu Road in this city has organized a relief group and promoted emergency relief for the poor people in Nanshi. It has been distributing relief supplies continuously for days. On the former memorial day of the Shanghai War, it also sent vehicles to distribute relief items such as wheat cakes, steamed buns, and wheat flour as usual. The scope of relief has now been extended to Tangjiawan, Chenghuang Temple, Haichao Temple Road, Xietu Road, Longhua Road, Gaochang Temple, and other places. It is reported that the association's emergency relief will continue until the blockade status is completely eliminated, so as to benefit the general poor.</p>
<h3>Banks Are Ordered to Balance Unsettled Foreign Exchange Today; Taylor Will Propose Measures to Manage the Foreign Exchange Market; There Is No Specific Method for Applying for Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the freezing orders of the United Kingdom and the United States were implemented, there have been many unclear points and difficulties in the implementation of Chinese and foreign banks. Mr. Taylor, an assistant to the Stabilization Commission, came to Shanghai to provide instructions and investigations. After arriving in Shanghai, Taylor has already made preliminary contact with foreign banks such as Citibank on the 13th, but as of yesterday, no contact with the Chinese banking community has been heard. It is said that Taylor will return to Hong Kong and make a suggestion to the Stabilization Fund based on the results of the investigation in Shanghai, in accordance with the government's determination to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market and effectively manage and prevent the Japanese from taking advantage of the principle. It is rumored that there is a saying that the US exchange rate will be maintained at 5 yuan and the British exchange rate will be 3 pence.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Will Have Suggestions</p>
<p>It is heard that Chinese banks will also submit a suggestion to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, requesting instructions on whether Chinese legitimate merchants need to go through application procedures when applying for foreign exchange. The Chinese financial authorities have not yet promulgated specific methods for this point, resulting in no way to follow. According to the current expedient method, all legitimate merchants applying for foreign exchange from Chinese and foreign banks must (1) have dealings with the bank, and (2) submit documents to prove that they are indeed a legitimate need. The simplicity of the method has many drawbacks, because the Japanese can use the Shanghai free trade port as a medium to transship and absorb foreign materials from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Deadline to Balance Foreign Exchange Today</p>
<p>The Bank of China will notify Chinese banks operating foreign exchange that checks and mortgage bills issued before July 26 may still be handled for receipt and payment with the US banks' accounts in accordance with the provisions of General Note No. 55. If they wish to transfer funds, the Central Bank may handle them on their behalf in accordance with the provisions of General Note No. 60. It is now learned that the Central Bank has ordered all banks to balance the above-mentioned unreceived foreign exchange by the deadline today and handle the receipt and payment on their behalf. The purpose of this method is to enable these banks to avoid business difficulties due to the freezing of funds. Taking August as an example, Chinese banks have experienced short selling of foreign exchange. Because this move contains speculative nature, the Central Bank has strictly ordered Chinese banks with such circumstances to make up for the short sales immediately and balance them all by today. Yesterday's report that the Central Bank will announce measures to manage the black market foreign exchange is a misunderstanding of the deadline for balancing foreign exchange trading. The Central Bank, fearing that the rumors were untrue and would have a profound impact, officially and firmly denied it yesterday.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange is Rampant and Planning for Remediation</p>
<p>After the order to freeze funds was issued, most people in the local market believed that the black market for foreign exchange would disappear invisibly, or at least not undergo the drastic changes of the past. Unexpectedly, the black market foreign exchange trade is still free, just as before. In fact, the control of foreign exchange has been transferred to the hands of fourteen foreign firms. In recent days, many companies have settled their accounts, and speculators have secretly absorbed them in the name of import foreign firms. As a result, foreign banks took the opportunity to raise prices and were unwilling to provide much. Although there were selling prices, they often could not be obtained in full when they were asked to settle. As a result, demand exceeded supply, and the exchange rate tightened. HSBC's listing has shrunk for three consecutive days, and the black market for the US exchange rate has broken through the 5 yuan mark, and the British exchange rate is unprecedentedly tight, and it is impossible to stabilize the black market.</p>
<h3>Business Corps Chinese Team Assists in Guarding</h3>
<p>This year's fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War, the authorities are more strict in preparing and defending than in previous years. In addition to the full mobilization of police and arresters, members of the International Business Corps also participated in assisting in the defense. The Chinese team and the translation team members were also ordered to form 26 car patrol teams, which took armed vehicles from 5:00 a.m. on the 9th to 8:00 a.m. yesterday, taking turns patrolling the main roads in the central district day and night. Therefore, during the standby period, the order within the boundary was safe and no accidents occurred. As for the remaining members of the two teams, they were also armed and waiting for orders during the standby period, ready to be dispatched at any time. This time, all the Chinese members of the Business Corps enthusiastically participated despite the hot weather, and a small number of team members went out to defend despite their illnesses. Their spirit of enthusiastically serving the local area is deeply admirable and is a great honor for our Chinese people. From today, the two concessions will resume ordinary standby.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Conducts Survey of Living Expenses of Salaried Class; Seeks 500 Chinese Household Budgeting Families</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have risen day by day, which has had a great impact on the living expenses of the salaried class. The current cost of living index of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council was originally compiled for workers and Westerners and is not applicable to the Chinese salaried class. Now, in order to meet the needs, a cost of living index for the salaried class is added, limited to Chinese families. The method of starting is to seek 500 official families. Each family will record detailed income and expenditure accounts for three months from October 1, 30th year of the Republic. The department has printed special account books, which are sent to each account-keeping family every month. Each family is assigned a number. The account book cover does not contain the name, only the number. After analysis, the index is published, and there is no other intention or any cost.</p>

<p>Attention to All Schools</p>
<p>To be cautious, the checks issued by this newspaper to applicant students, bearing the school's name, will have the phrase "or bearer" crossed out to prevent abuse. Students can then submit these checks to their paying bank or school. This method poses no problem for schools with bank accounts, but may present difficulties for those without. Therefore, we have requested the issuing bank to honor the checks when presented by the bearer, with the school's seal and responsible person's endorsement. We kindly ask schools to accept these checks when students submit them for tuition payments and not refuse them, appreciating the students' difficulties and the need for strict scholarship disbursement procedures.</p>
<p>High School and University Group</p>
<p>The High School and University Scholarship Committee will convene on the 19th of this month for the final review. The list of approved recipients is scheduled to be announced on the 10th. Please pay attention. If there are any changes to the "Intended School" listed on the application form, please notify this newspaper with a letter and attach the admission notice immediately. If school exam results are not released before the 19th, please inform this newspaper. Otherwise, checks bearing the name of a school different from the one the student attends will not be cashed. We hope for your attention and cooperation.</p>

<h3>Abandoned for Ten Years; Pouring Out Endless Hidden Pain: Visit to Scholarship Applicant, No. 8</h3>
<p>Miss L. is nineteen years old this year, and plans to enter the English Department of a certain church university after the summer vacation. Her sister, twelve years old, has been admitted to a certain church girls' school. They both applied for scholarships at the same time. In Miss L.'s resume section, it was filled in: "Father abandoned the family and did not care for it when the applicant was eight years old because he had an affair, and it has been more than ten years since then." When I saw this application form, it aroused keen attention, so I visited her the day after receiving the documents.</p>
<p>I took the No. 22 bus to the intersection of Fulu Road and Qiqi Road, walked not far west, and found their address. After knocking on the copper ring on the shikumen for a few times, a young woman opened the door.</p>
<p>"Is there a Miss L. here?" I asked the young woman. At the same time, I glanced at the living room, which was very clean.</p>
<p>"Where are you from? What's the matter?" the young woman asked me politely.</p>
<p>"I am from the newspaper for the scholarship matter. I want to visit two Miss Ls. Do they live here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there are Miss Ls here. They live in the pavilion room on the third floor."</p>
<p>"Can I go in from here?" Because the living room was a room, I dared not rush in. After receiving her permission, she led me through the living room and walked up the escalator. I turned around and said thank you to her.</p>
<p>Walking up to the pavilion room on the third floor, a lady in her fifties was already welcoming me at the door. I walked into the pavilion room, and the lady invited me to sit on a square stool and poured me a cup of boiled water. She sat on the bed opposite me. The furnishings in the room were very simple, but very clean. I already knew that this family was quite noble.</p>
<p>"Two ladies applied for scholarships to our newspaper, and I am here to visit today. Have the two ladies gone out? Is this Mrs. L.?"</p>
<p>"I don't dare, yes. It's really unfortunate, they both have something to go out. "Mrs. L. answered my questions in a calm tone.</p>
<p>"Miss L. took the ×× University exam. I think she must have been admitted? Looking at the results, her studies are very good."</p>
<p>"The exam period has not arrived yet. They are still diligent. When the eldest one was studying in middle school, she also worked as a tutor to supplement her pocket money because the economy was too difficult."</p>
<p>"How many sisters and brothers does Miss L. have? What does Mr. L. do? Where is he now?"</p>
<p>Mrs. L. sighed after hearing my words.</p>
<p>"Our family should be able to help others as much as possible. Who would have thought that we are now living such a difficult life, and the children have to ask others for help to study!" Mrs. L. said in a sad tone, telling her experience and family situation. "The children's father is a legislator in the government. He abandoned us ten years ago! At first, I sued him in court. After several hearings, the case was not closed. Later, he ran away to another place, and the lawsuit was shelved. Since then, he has abandoned the entire family and does not care about the children!"</p>
<p>"The eldest son is twenty-six years old this year. He is married and is now working at the Qinhuangdao Customs. Now we rely entirely on him to send 100 yuan a month to support us. The second daughter is twenty-four years old and is idle at home. The third daughter is twenty-two years old and works as a family teacher. The fourth daughter is nineteen years old. She just graduated from middle school and wants to go to university, so she applied to your newspaper, because I am illiterate myself, of course I hope my children can study well, but now there is no strength? The fifth son is seventeen years old and went to the rear to join the army last year. I heard that he is now in some military academy. The sixth daughter, twelve years old, just graduated from elementary school and has been admitted to ×× Girls' School. They are all very good, but the younger daughter is going to middle school in the second half of the year. The journey is very long and it is very inconvenient to go back and forth, and the expenses are also very high: she cannot read and teach like her sister to earn some pocket money."</p>
<p>Family disputes and personal trauma are usually not easily confided to others. But for the sake of a scholarship application visit, I didn't want to, and shouldn't have, inquired into everything in the past, but only asked about the current economic life situation. Unexpectedly, this aroused the inner trauma of the parents of the applicants, and they confided to us, without any concealment, the course of their life's misery. This is something we are very sorry for and should give unlimited sympathy.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that a national legislator cannot "establish" his own "law".</p>
<p>"Mrs. L., your children are very ambitious, you are still a blessed person!" I comforted her sympathetically when I left. (T)</p>

<h3>Welfare Bakery Fire; Four Killed and Injured; Apprentice Jumps Out Window and Dies in Flames; Three Injured Severely Climbing Through Skylight</h3>
<p>Around 2:25 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at Welfare Bakery Company, established by Shandong native Yang Guanlin at Nos. 483-491 Rue du Consulat. The fire spread rapidly and could not be contained, resulting in a total of four deaths and injuries. The fire was extinguished around 4:00 PM, causing severe losses. Welfare Bakery Company, which also manufactures candies and biscuits, has been in operation for many years and has a thriving business, having opened three branches on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Oil Pan Explodes</p>
<p>Around 2:25 PM yesterday afternoon, while the company was busy at work, the diesel oven pipe on the upper floor of the workshop at No. 485 suddenly ruptured with a loud noise, causing diesel to spill and catch fire. The fire quickly spread to Nos. 487 and 483. Within five minutes, five rooms on the floor were engulfed in flames. Seeing this situation, the workers scattered to find exits. However, the floor had only one staircase leading to the retail department at No. 493, and all the windows were covered with wire mesh, making it impossible to jump down. Zhang Wenjie (32 years old), Tong Zhiding (24 years old), and Xu Yaoxing (around 30 years old) climbed through the skylight and jumped from the roof. They were all covered in flames. Zhang was the most severely injured, with burns to his head, chest, hands, and feet. Xu Yaoxing suffered burns to his hands and feet, and his head was fractured from the fall. Tong Zhiding was the least injured. All three were taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Apprentice Burned to Death</p>
<p>An apprentice, only 15 years old, panicked at the sight of the fire. Unaware that the windows were nailed with wire mesh, he tried to climb out of the window. However, the fire had already reached him, and he perished in the flames. When the fire broke out, the fire department was immediately notified and dispatched fire engines to the scene. However, since oil is lighter than water, the burning oil floated on the water surface. Therefore, despite efforts to spray water, the fire only intensified. The fire was gradually extinguished using chemical foam. After investigation, it was found that five large rooms were destroyed. The company had reportedly insured for 150,000 yuan with an insurance company. The person in charge of the company stated that this was the previous insurance policy, and with the current high prices, the losses would exceed 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ding's Ointment Sells Well</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been humid and sultry, and various surgical conditions such as redness, swelling, pain, dampness, and heat boils have become prevalent. As a result, the sales of Ding's Ointment produced by China No. 1 Pharmaceutical Factory have increased, surpassing imported products. It is said that this ointment can eliminate the shape and traces of early-stage heat boils in two hours. If the swelling has already subsided, it can also drain pus and close the wound. When used for dampness, it can immediately draw out large amounts of moisture and toxins, clear internal toxins, and often heal the affected area quickly.</p>

<h3>Yarn; Bulls Rush into the Future Yarn Market; Spot Yarn Prices Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned upward again. This is because the consolidation for several days has triggered bullish activity, resulting in a particularly strong rebound. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants have a strong demand for 32-count single yarn, and prices are rising. As a result, market sentiment is good. In addition, the yarn and cloth market conditions on the exchange are rising steadily, further intensifying the speculative mood of general traders and triggering a buying spree, pushing the market forward. However, transactions of 20-count yarn by Hong Kong merchants remain weak. The deficit of those with sufficient capital is not being offset. General speculators, given the tense situation, are starting to switch from short to long positions. Therefore, the price has broken through the 160 yuan mark. The upward momentum is strong. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,641 yuan, and the low price is 1,624 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,633 yuan. Due to the high prices on the exchange and strong market sentiment, the buying momentum intensified, rising directly to 1,655 yuan. The final price was 1,652 yuan. Regarding the current situation of the yarn market, some say that if the price rises by several tens of yuan, they will sell, while others will buy, which is a purely speculative effect.</p>
<p>The morning opening of Double Horse was enthusiastic because the exchange price had already risen on the previous day, and the bulls followed. The opening price was 1,630 yuan, and it soon fell to 1,624 yuan. However, it was heard that the price of Blue Phoenix yarn was not loosening, and buyers increased their bids. Under this environment, those who were short had no power to resist and scrambled to cover their positions, pushing the price back up to 1,641 yuan. However, those who were making profits sold, causing the price to loosen again to 1,632 yuan. The closing price was 1,636 yuan. It was found that the total volume of transactions during the half-day was 7,700 bales. The amounts purchased by each trading group are listed below: Hong Kong, 200 bales; Traders, 7,500 bales; Total, 7,700 bales.</p>
<p>The future market for Gold Double Horse yarn continued the momentum of the previous day and advanced sharply again. At the initial opening, although the spot yarn price rose sharply by more than 20 yuan due to the lack of market on the previous day, the future yarn price hovered. The opening price for the August contract was 1,475 yuan, slightly down by 3 yuan. The September contract was 1,554 yuan, also down by 3 yuan. The October contract was 1,568.5 yuan, slightly down by 1.5 yuan. Later, as the gold market rose sharply and the exchange also rose, market sentiment became excited. Bulls came one after another, and the market price rose steadily under the cover of buying sentiment. However, as floating longs and retail investors sold from time to time, the noon closing price for the August contract was 1,478 yuan, the September contract was 1,561 yuan, and the October contract was 1,578.5 yuan, which were still mixed. 9,220 bales were traded, During the afternon session, the market situation became increasingly strong, and positive news spread frequently. In addition, the spot yarn foundation was solid, which further aroused the trust of buyers. Therefore, demand exceeded supply on the trading floor, and prices rose sharply. Especially near the close, due to the gold market being outside the market by nearly 200 yuan, the three-lot October contract once broke out of the 1,600 yuan range. As a result, the August contract was 1,489 yuan, an increase of 11 yuan at the close; the September contract was 1,579 yuan, a high increase of 22 yuan; and the October contract was 1,596 yuan, a sharp increase of 26.5 yuan. The difference between the near and far terms was 107 yuan. The total volume traded during the day was 16,440 bales, an increase of 6,940 bales compared to the previous day. Observing the strong foundation of the yarn market, there is no lack of bulls pushing up the price and other factors. With the addition of short selling from retail investors, there is a chance for further increases. The table of market prices during the day is listed below.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Loan Passed, Fine Cotton Inevitably to Rise, New York Buying, Industry Speculation, and Short Covering All Present, Shanghai Transactions of Fine Cotton Not as Numerous as Coarse Cotton</h3>
<p>The local cotton market situation is even more enthusiastic, transactions are active, prices are firm, 42s and 32s raw materials inevitably rise, but fine cotton is too expensive after all, there is not much spot, and less trading, although the demand for coarse cotton is not strong, the transaction of the traders is prosperous, so the transaction of foreign cotton is enthusiastically expanded due to the excitement of the people, American cotton, Mitelin and high-grade Brazilian cotton are all up five or six yuan from the previous day, because all parties have a good buying intention, and American and Indian cotton have risen again, the general intention of the traders and hoarders is to collect the spot, and continue to work hard, at the same time, a few factories are also ordering large batches of Brazilian cotton arriving in Shanghai in September and October to compete, yesterday Jardine Matheson's ship "Yusheng" arrived in Shanghai in the morning, transporting 4,500 bales of cotton from Calcutta, India, stored in the Roosevelt Warehouse, after this arrival continues, the yarn factory's raw materials, even if the situation changes, will not be in danger of shortage, but people think that this cotton has been plundered, and they have to seek foreign cotton, resulting in this phenomenon, yesterday's cotton transactions are as follows,</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to selling pressure, but then rebounded due to political news from Washington, the National Government successfully passed the Smith Bill, industry buying, speculative buying, and general short covering were all active for a while, as a result, the closing price rose sharply by fifty to fifty-six points per pound from the previous day,</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first rose due to buying by European exporters, and then fell due to selling by retail investors, but then rose again due to short covering and speculative buying, yesterday's closing prices each rose two to six rupees, and it is predicted that the opening market today will rise by five rupees due to the sharp rise in American cotton,</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Prefer to Settle Foreign Exchange Inward, Making Large New Transactions</h3>

<h3>Confessions of a Weakling: My Hopes for Scholarship Applicants</h3>
<p>— Xintang</p>
<p>A Sound Mind is Essential, and a Strong Body is Absolutely Necessary</p>
<p>I have been out of middle school for six years, and I still have a strong desire to study, but I am a disabled person, a lung disease sufferer. I am very envious of you scholarship applicants, who have received the enthusiastic appeals of zealous reporters and the support of society's most kind people from impossible circumstances, allowing you to continue to advance. I rejoice in your future, but the other day, when I saw in a "visiting record" a scholarship applicant with a thin physique, I couldn't help but remember my tragedy, which is a good reference for applicants. My family is also very poor, living entirely off of five acres of land. I am a little luckier than you, in that I have good relatives who often support me, allowing me to enter middle school. Later, I received help from a cousin uncle, finally getting into high school. In the two years leading up to graduation, I prepared to enter the Central Political School, where there are no costs. So I studied hard day and night, never going to bed before twelve o'clock every night. When I was tired, I desperately drank black tea, which was quite effective, so there was not a single word in chemistry or physics that I did not read thoroughly. But after supporting myself like this for two months, my body finally changed. It was inevitable that I would become thinner, my chest felt sore from time to time, and I also suffered from insomnia. My innate constitution was not very good, so in the third month, I contracted the frightening symptom of spitting blood. I spat out large mouthfuls, each time filling a spittoon, and from then on, I gradually became unable to get up and stopped going to school. At that time, my uncle called me to his house, where I helped with some paperwork, and I was fortunate enough not to be forced by life, barely surviving until now, but this fate is tragic.</p>
<p>Diligence in reading is important, but physical fitness is equally important. I have seen many classmates who studied diligently for many years and later developed lung disease, disappointing and regrettable everyone.</p>
<p>Scholarship applicants, I think you are all excellent talents, but quickly pay attention to your physical fitness, and do not be like me in blindly reading and destroying yourself. It is very helpful to take notes when reading each book. Mathematics only requires a flexible mind and doing a lot of practice... When dealing with homework, I hope you add interest to it. We must have appropriate allocation of energy, and our bodies and minds must have suitable adjustments. When reading to a certain point, please do not neglect exercise, taking a walk, practicing boxing, which are most beneficial. Wasting your body is as disappointing as wasting your studies. You are even more hardworking children from difficult backgrounds, and nutrition is out of the question. At the same time, many people's enthusiasm is placed on you, so you must not disappoint them, so pay attention to your body in addition to your studies.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Wu Zhihui's three major elements for students:</p>
<p>(1) Bright and happy.</p>
<p>(2) Useful.</p>
<p>(3) Honest.</p>
<p>Happiness is important. No matter how poor and difficult we are, many adult histories tell us that poverty is the whip that encourages us to move forward.</p>

<p>Editor's note: The writer has seen many scholarship applications submitted to this newspaper, most of which describe their own circumstances and educational aspirations in a sad way, and there are also on-site investigation reports from various gentlemen: living in a corner of poverty, wearing ragged clothes, a sad picture of scholars, truly sad and real, giving me unparalleled emotion. Du Fu said: "How can I get thousands of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world," but it is only sympathy for the same illness, and I am powerless. However, after sobbing, I got a kind of inexplicable comfort: only in poverty can we make progress, the so-called put to death and then live, the aspirations of the poor scholars are very ambitious, if they do not give up, they will succeed. What kind of person is Shun, what kind of person am I, those who have the ability are also like this. However, in this struggle process, I hope to overcome all difficulties and cultivate our noble spirit well. The material environment of the students has been fully shown in the eyes and writings of the gentlemen, and the mental distress is probably only known to those who have experienced it. Most of the students cried out loud when they stated their cases, no wonder, but please keep optimism in your heart at all times, and various material things such as malnutrition, poor and cramped housing, are already inferior to others, and mental distress will destroy the health of the body, and thus fall into mental illness, then it is difficult. Only with a healthy body can there be a healthy mind, please think twice. This should also be the case in a simple and arduous academic career. The ancients hung their heads and pricked their thighs, and collected fireflies to illuminate the snow, which were passed down as beautiful stories, but may I ask, if there is no strong body, coupled with moderate labor, and spiritual cultivation, their hard work will only be entangled with the demons of disease, how can they realize their ideals? What Mr. Xintang said is due to his previous lack of physical training, "focusing only on reading the books in front of him, and not opening his ears to things outside the window," the method is too old, and there are many drawbacks, please students also pay attention to the necessity of labor and cultivation at the same time, so that they can reach the perfect state.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Eleven Midnight Song</p>
<p>That person did not answer, but first sized up Mei Bao with a very funny expression.</p>
<p>"Why not? She has a pair of hands, as long as she can pick up the ruler and hit her own unfeeling child with force. What's wrong with being a teacher?"</p>
<p>Mei Bao also laughed, and at the same time, she remembered that he was Zhao Uncle, who had come to Zhangshu Village to see them three or four years ago, from the middle-aged man's funny attitude and laughable words.</p>
<p>Zhao Uncle seemed to have been here for several days. This time, he even brought many things that could not be bought in the countryside, and a large bag of unopened Western candies. Although the clothes he was wearing were still as old and worn as last time. This evening, because Mei Bao had also brought back some food from the city, plus a basket of freshly steamed dumplings and a few stir-fried dishes made by Xiao Gouzi, everyone ate very happily. Qiu Haitang and his daughter both poured several glasses of Wujiapi for Zhao Yukun, and he and Xiao Gouzi rushed to eat and drink like crazy, until the last two bottles of Wujiapi he brought were also emptied, before he was willing to put down the cup and chopsticks in his hand.</p>
<p>"Lao Er, it seems that you will not be able to change your sky-is-falling-down-I-don't-care temperament even when you are old!"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang stood against the wall, watching Xiao Gouzi and Mei Bao clean up the dishes, and said to Yukun with a smile.</p>
<p>"Isn't it good this way? Otherwise, how could I be able to be happy like it's New Year's every day?" Yukun stood up from the bench with staggering steps. "Tonight is very good, I still have to go around a few circles outside the village!" (185)</p>
<h3>Reading Editorials</h3>
<p>— Li Jialin</p>
<p>Essential for Youth</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai is full of depravity and filth in many places.</p>
<p>What young people study in their spare time is either peach-colored reports or gray news, and the general reading materials are too bad. But we have to look for the reading materials that our young people need in today's major newspapers. There is no doubt that the editorial is one of the main ones, but I know that there are probably not many people who read it every day, because it is still a relatively tedious task.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen in our school is still tutoring us for free during the summer vacation. He told us to read editorials, and temporarily designated us to read the Shenbao editorials every day. Mr. Chen said: There are many excellent materials in the editorials. It is not easy to collect these materials at ordinary times, and the literary value of the editorials is also very valuable. There are many satisfactory aspects to the application of idioms and the structure of sentences, especially the ability to be relevant.</p>
<p>As for what is the biggest gain for us to read editorials? That is, reading it can make us more aware of the current international situation. We know that in the editorials, the commentary on the international situation is quite thorough, and the insights are quite superb. In today's turbulent world, we are not fools, not blind people, how can we not care about the evolution of today's international situation? To be honest, the evolution of the international situation has a great relationship with our country and ourselves. I am really sad that there are some so-called senior Chinese people, so-called intellectual youths, who are very concerned about peach-colored reports and gray news! But if you talk to them about the current international situation, they will be irrelevant and talk nonsense, or when they are unhappy, they may say to you that they do not want to talk about current affairs.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say that I do not want to attack those who are indifferent to the world situation, but I advise everyone to read editorials, especially young people. I believe that my motivation cannot be considered bad!</p>
<h3>A Lot of Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Huanjun</p>
<p>A: Oh! Long time no see, old brother, you are always making a fortune.</p>
<p>B: No, studying.</p>
<p>A: Studying, that's great, studying is better than doing business, you will definitely have a good future. May I ask which school you are at?</p>
<p>B: Zhongnan University.</p>
<p>A: So, old brother is a talented student from Zhongnan University, I am very disrespectful. What major are you studying now?</p>
<p>B: Liberal Arts.</p>
<p>A: Studying Liberal Arts is the best, I didn't see that you, old brother, are a future writer.</p>
<p>B: Not necessarily, not necessarily.</p>
<p>A: Then what do you plan to do after you graduate?</p>
<p>B: I think it would be best to get into politics and hang around.</p>
<p>A: That's right! That's what I mean too, look at the big shots in the government, which one is not a writer... You must have been studying for a long time now, and you are about to graduate, right?</p>
<p>B: No! This morning, I was taking the entrance exam for that school, and there is probably no problem with being admitted.</p>
<p>A: Oh...</p>
<h3>What's So Funny?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Rurong</p>
<p>"Where did you go just now?" The manager was unhappy. "To the barber to get a haircut." "You can't use office hours to do your private affairs." "Isn't my hair growing during office hours too?" "Not all of it." "Therefore, I didn't shave my hair clean."</p>
<p>The voice on the phone: "Hello, can you please ask the doctor to come to my house immediately? My child swallowed a needle." The doctor's maid: "The doctor is busy operating on a patient right now. If you need the needle right away, I can send one over first."</p>
<p>When a wealthy man was visiting a hospital, he was touched by the exquisite equipment inside, so he said to the head nurse: "If I have an accident on the road in the future, I hope to come here to recuperate." The head nurse said: "Sir, having an accident is not enough. There must be a physiological miracle, because this is a women's hospital!" (Remuneration for Scholarship Fund)</p>

<h3>The Annals of the Chrysanthemum Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Deng Xiaoxian</p>
<p>(1) The Tongtian Sect Leader Has a Full House of Disciples (Part 1)</p>
<p>Speaking of the North Country Pear Garden, there is a Tongtian Sect Leader, that is, the well-known Wang Yaoqing boss. Speaking of Wang Yaoqing, he can be called a generation of famous actors. In those days, he and Tan Da Wang called the sky to match, and his reputation really filled the north and south of the Yangtze River. In terms of art, his skills really have unique places, especially in performing Qizhuang opera and Daomadan opera, which is really unmatched by ordinary people. In recent decades, Yaoqing has been old, and limited by his voice, so he no longer puts on makeup and goes on stage, but amuses himself by teaching his disciples. Yaoqing originally had a lot of disciples, and in the past ten years, he has been engaged in teaching his disciples, and people have flocked to join Wang's family. Therefore, the ancient Mao Xuan (Yaoqing's self-proclaimed ancient Mao Xuan) has a full house of disciples, and the number of disciples is countless. Therefore, his colleagues gave him the title of "Tongtian Sect Leader". Some people say that the four words "Tongtian Sect Leader" contain two meanings besides the above reasons: one is that he has a wide belly, knows a lot of skills, and has boundless magic; the other is that although he has boundless magic, he is a heretic, so he is called "Tongtian Sect Leader". Otherwise, why not call him "Original Heavenly Venerable"? Although the words are a bit like that, they are actually reasonable.</p>
<p>Someone asked me Wang Yaoqing. How many disciples are there in the end? In this section, it is really necessary to write it out and tell the readers. According to Yaoqing's own statistics, there are Guo Xianglin, Luo Xiaobao, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, Xiao Cuihua, Wang Yifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Rong Diexian, Huang Yulin, Ma Yanbing, Wang Yunfang, Dai Yanwan, Wu Lanfang, Guo Xiaoqing, Li Jizhi, Cheng Yuqing, Zhao Tongshan, Li Lingfeng, Jin Biyan, Li Xiangyun, Nan Tiesheng, Wang Shengyi, Sun Chengfang, Su Jingzi, Zhang Xiaoshan, Song Dezhu, (above are male)</p>
<p>Mr. Deng Xiaoxian, a special writer for this publication, wrote "Annals of the Chrysanthemum Kingdom", which is novel, tortuous, interesting and meaningful. Please pay attention to it, readers. (Editor)</p>

<h3>Drama Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>Huang Jin represents Jin Yuansheng. After Sun Lan arrived in Beiping, he contacted Ma Yunliang for business.

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Shuo Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters, Delicate Gauze</p>
<p>The lyricist, upon hearing Yuan Yuan's words, scratched his head and sighed, saying, "Yuan Yuan, of course, I don't want anything bad to happen to you. It's just that regarding our matter, my mother has already agreed, but my father still won't budge. It can only be realized after I pass the autumn examination, so I have to wait patiently, preparing to make a name for myself in one fell swoop, and our good fortune can also be fulfilled, and my father won't object. How can I open my mouth to my father now? Moreover, if I want to free you from the registry of entertainers, I have to spend a lot of money in front of your adoptive mother. How can I get that money in a snap?" After the lyricist finished speaking, he sighed again for a long time, rubbing his hands frequently, but all in vain. Yuan Yuan said, "I regret going on that Lingyan trip with you the day before yesterday, otherwise, I wouldn't have met that Tian Hongyu." The lyricist said, "It's useless. Since Tian Hongyu came here, how could he not want to visit the beautiful women of Jiangnan? Your fame has long been all over the southeast, how could he not know? Moreover, his father has that 'butterfly' there encouraging him. The 'butterfly' originally wanted to find a way to ruin us because she was jealous of our love. Even if we didn't meet at Lingyan, she would have led him to you." Yuan Yuan stamped her small foot and said, "That bastard is too hateful! Is it really my fate to be afflicted by evil stars? You love me, but if, unfortunately, what you fear becomes a reality, what will we do? It's better to be prepared. Can't you think of a good way?" Yuan Yuan said, her voice trembling slightly, tears welling up in her eyes, almost about to cry. Seeing her like this, the lyricist really had no good plan for a while, and he felt very uncomfortable, as if needles were pricking him. After a while, he scratched his head with his hand, then clenched his fist and knocked on the table, like an ant on a hot pan. After a long time, he blurted out, "Then...then...what should we do? Shouldn't you move again?" Seeing him so embarrassed, Yuan Yuan felt both pity and annoyance. She frowned and then said, "According to me, there is only one way, which is for you and me to leave here together tomorrow night and avoid meeting them. Then Tian Hongyu won't be able to do anything to us."</p>
