<p>社評</p>
<h3>美軍事使節團來華</h3>
<p>以馬格魯德爾將軍爲領袖之美軍事使節團，在前數日，已有米華的傳說，至日咋始由羅斯福總統於招待新聞記者時予以證實；此一舉措，顯係實施大西洋釣游會議中決定的重要政策之一。吾人於獲悉此興奮消息之際，在直覺上，已深切認識美國的賢明政策是如何堅定；而痛擊遠束暴力的軍事專家，現在確已眞正地踏上了征途，數日來因美日談判而起的一切疑慮情緒，至此都廓然澄淸。就此舉意義上來研究，得到下列幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，羅邱在大西洋會議中所決定的最大原則，是把擊潰東西兩暴力的工作，支配與英美兩國；美國却肩起了東方艱鉅的任務。英相邱吉爾已迭决發表聲明，萬一美日發生衝突，英國必然援助美國，此種保證，顯然暗示美國今後在太平洋上所承乏的使命。美國最近表示，如果英蘇在伊朗軍事成功，則美國的太平洋艦隊決不離去太平洋，並將自美國西海岸起，護送軍事供應至英國及蘇聯，經由英屬馬來亞而至印度及波斯灣，再越過伊朗或裏海而至蘇聯之東南部。照這樣看來，美國爲加强民治陣綫之聯繫與軍事上需要起見，實有研究各國戰略和一般局勢的必要。</p>
<p>第二，世人對於最近美日談話，認爲或係綏靖政策的變相復活，雖然華盛頓方面，一再闡述其一貫政策與夫維護九國公的的決心，但中國對於此項談判的原則在根本上小無多少懷疑。今美國遣派軍事團來華，擔任實際工作，可將此項疑慮，完全打消，質言之，就是證實了綏靖政策已完全消滅，美國決不會與日本妥協。赫爾曾明告野村，「日本如繼續侵略，則美國不願對日妥協，並將進一步對日施行經濟壓力」，這句話也不是無因的。</p>
<p>第三，美日非正式談話，尚在不斷進行中，美國以最大的忍耐，希望取得美日異見之和平解決，這在美國，不是畏懼日本；亦不是畏懼戰爭，牠所蘄致的，是避免不必要的犧牲而獲得公允的和平解決方案。吾人應得明暸美國一面從事於懸有崇高目標的談判，一面却又努力着一般實際行動，這就是具體說明了牠的眞正意嚮，如果日本放棄侵犯，則一切可從長計議，否則惟有以武力打擊武力。美國固努力與日談判，同時也努力採取行動，此决軍事團之來華、不能不承認是美國重要行動之一。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，美軍事團之來華，在意義上極堪重視，至於此來之任務，據華盛頓電訉所傳：一，會同中國與其他當局研究中國境內軍事局勢及其戰具之需要，二，編製其所需各物種類與數量上之條陳，三，襄助此種需要物在國內之羅致與對華之解交四提出適當性質之建議、，以期租借案下之對華援助，得有儘量可能之效率，以有益於美國中國與世界反抗武力征服運動之努力。</p>
<p>賦有這樣重要使命與這樣廣大權力的軍事使節團，將於半月內啟程來華，吾人現在不必研究其職務之如何執行，工作之如何開始，但吾人可斷言者、今後中國戰略，在友邦軍事專家貢獻意見之下，必可獲得多少新的改進，有利於將來的總反攻。關於機械化部隊及空軍的訓練，得專家之指示、亦將以簇新的姿態，在戰地與天空發揮驚人的咸力。至於新式武器的按時到達，數量的增加與夫如何保衛滇緬路。以利運輸等事，則又是使節團與中國當局朝夕所研討的問題，更不待言說了。</p>
<p>誠如胡適大使所言，羅邱會議，並未忽視中國，吾人對於美國此一舉措，認爲具有遠見卓識，確予中國以莫大的根本援助，與精神上的鼓勵，抑且以事實向世人說明了對日綏靖政策的中止。吾人且可斷言，此後美國必有更堅決更具體的事實，不斷的在遠東方面表現，予暴力以制命的打擊。</p>

<h3>郭泰祺對合衆社記者談　美決不致出賣中國　中國已已成世界外交界中活動份子　對現時國際局勢發展有重大貢獻　太平洋問題非中國合作不得解決</h3>
<p>重慶　郭泰祺博士昨晚復申言、渠相信在現時在華盛頓舉行之日美談判中、美國決不致出賣中國、郭氏為補充其在星期一對外國記者所發表之官式文吿、並因中國民衆方面尚有對於日美談判感覺不安者、故特專對合衆社作上述聲明、郭外長原來發表之文吿、係評論邱吉爾在星期日所發表之無綫電演說、渠言中國並不應憂慮及被出賣、渠稱一許多外人甚至有　輩華人、皆忽視中國久已不復僅為外國外交政策之客體之事實、中國經四年之前綫鬥爭、並為反侵略之前鋒、已成為世界外交舞台中之活動份子、中國對於現時國際局勢之發展、有極重要之貢獻、對於戰後之建設、亦願有所貢獻、中國乃一合夥者、因此若非中國同意合作、則在太平洋上不能獲得終局之解決、最後郭氏復笑言曰、「中國並不欲被犧牲」云、（二十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>中共分析英美宣言</p>
<p>重慶　新華日報延安電、中共對美總統羅斯福及英首相邱吉爾聯合宣言、及行將召集之莫斯科會議、十九日發表聲明、略謂此項宣言及會議、表示了英美打擊法西斯主義的決心、故對蘇、對英美、對中國、對世界、均完全有利、美國表明決心、乃反法西斯侵略陣綫、已在政治上完成、莫斯科會議則將在組織上完成之、羅邱宣言未提及日本、其中第四第七條且暗示企圖拉攏日本現狀維持派、但第二第三第八各條、是積極反日的、故全中國人民均歡迎英美宣言、歡迎行將在莫斯科召集的英美蘇會議、一我們相信、只要全國人民、增加努力、則團體便能鞏固、政策便能堅持、反攻便能實現、中國是有資格參加世界反法西斯陣綫、而成為一個有能力的方面軍的、全中國與全人類的命運、關係於這一反法西斯主義的决鬥、中國各黨派、應該善處引種千載難逢的時機、團結全國人民、一致向好的進步的方面努力、這是我們共產人所深切希望的、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>西南空中的旅程（二）　香港·重慶·昆明·臘戌</h3>
<p>臘戌一瞥</p>
<p>在昆明稍停，上落乘客，加注汽油。天色薄暗，日機竟日沒有飛臨城郊，現在也不會再來了。有一美國無綫電工程師在此間航空學校中任敎，據他說日機駕駛員大都？還是在航校的學生。</p>
<p>最末一桶汽油加好後我們再行起飛。在比校惡劣的氣候中，我們在黑暗裹飛越航程中最高的山嶺。沒有一人對於這種惡劣氣候担心，後來有一個受驚的華籍旅客竟因飛機振盪劇烈，從座位上滑到通道中。飛機在一萬四千呎高空，你覺得有點心神不安，氣候寒冷，同時兩腿發麻。你把身體伸伸直，坐坐正，心想爲什麼會這樣的。DC-2號機如在大浪中翻騰的一條海船。離昆明時幾個華籍旅客本來是嘻嘻哈哈的，現在却沉靜下來。你現在能見到的是山中有無數大的火圈，原來農民把山上叢樹燒光，好讓山洪衝下，灌溉田畝。這是美麗而不可思議的：在一片昏黑中驟然見到萬道紅光，蔚如奇觀。於是飛機側飛降落下來，我們把身體都繫在坐位上。我們直到降地了才知道這是臘戍機塲。</p>
<p>脚伕把行李送到機塲辦公處。那辦公處是一所竹搭山屋，點着一盞煤油燈。幾個混血種的檢查員，汗出如漿，忙着看我們的護照。這是夜間十時。我們在空中已有十二小時，經過路程，比了自美國的綠山磯至聖路易斯還要長。我們睡在床上，睡得很熟。有大浴盆洗澡，食物亦像預期的一般好。明天我們出去觀察街景。臘戍是東方新興的城市，由仰光來的鐵道以此爲終點，通到中國的緬甸公路以此爲起點。所見到的景象有：一個生動而汚穢的市集，幾所兵營，木建的西式住宅，土著女人很羞怯地就公共水管邊周身揩抹，一家珠寶店中收買並不十分珍貴的寶石。（據印度店主說，他並不藏有上好寶石，因爲這大危險）</p>
<p>我們回到飛機塲，大小只及美國標準戰塲的一半。在竹屋辦公處外面，一塊漆得很整齊的牌上寫着：紐的離此一二九二三哩，舊金山離此一〇二四〇哩。我見許多緬甸男子女子，和黃牛在機塲上舖平紅土，有一隊澳洲驅逐機將在此降落，這地位就是留給他們的。</p>
<p>我們坐在日光下等待氣候報告。報告來了。天氣極好，有另外二十七架日機正在轟炸昆明，須等警報解除後才出發。我們要在日機剛離昆明時抵達，再等日機尚未來之前的黎明，飛離昆明。如由緬甸公路乘汽車自臘戍到昆明，路上一切順利的話。至少要一星期可到。但乘飛機，順風二小時十分可到。現在時候還早，緬人趕着牛羣在犂地，日光很熱。</p>
<p>昆明景象</p>
<p>我們現在已飛抵昆明，從空中下瞰被炸區域極爲渺小。在飛機上你不會知道房屋摧倒時的樣子是怎樣，聲音是怎樣的；你也不會知道有人活埋在房屋下面，你更不會曉得先前住在房屋中的人現在無家可歸。從上面看一炸彈掉下來是很簡單的。</p>
<p>飛機現在己降地，我們回到旅館。城中被炸區城，黯然無光。我們坐了人力車。車夫氣喘吁吁，喊着，「噲！嗆，」也懶得用車鈴了。你可以從殘瓦頹垣中，嗅到一股塵埃的氣味，還在燃燒中的房屋升起一縷黑烟，人民愈聚愈多。車夫現在跑得慢了，砌在街道中的石塊都已翻出路面，電話綫電燈綫盤得滿街都是。一羣人守在一家大電影院門前。影院中正放映五彩片香姝寶馬（Kentucky），華人在黑暗中靜靜地守候，等電綫修好後再看電影。</p>
<p>你如其要在被彈片洞穿的地方跑跑，總有給栽倒的危險。狹仄的街上充滿了中國人：男人穿了黑色或業色褪色的衣裳，幾個小脚女人在街上顚躓行走，農婦裹了垂到背上的髮辮，穿着黑色衣褲，孩子在人流中穿梭來去。他們都是靜靜地走得很慢。自來水總管已被彈片所中，陰溝中與街上全給水浸滿。你可以聽到人們的走動，可以聽到鎚子與鐵鏟的聲音，向堅硬的泥塊或石頭中發掘。人民借了燭光或煤油燈光，沿備開掘道路，回到目己受炸的家中。</p>
<p>昆明的人口有五十萬。空襲警報來時他們連大門都來不及鎖好，逃避郊外。城中並無防空設備，脆弱的房屋又沒有任何保障；人民逃到山中，看空城中投彈。也有小逃的人，那是疲勞過份，或者是害病的，或是討厭每天去跑長路，但都給炸死。現在天色已晚，人民正從郊外安全地帶回來，看看他們的家損毀到如何程度。</p>
<p>我們住在歐洲飯店，那家旅館沒有受炸。我們飲一點酒，這是算豪華了，而且是很有意思的事情。我同羅埃說，這已是一整天過去了，事實上已經是二日。當然這對於他不算什麼。他在中國飛行已有六年之久，他曾當過少帥的私人機師，把蔣委員長夫婦從西安刦持中飛出。他於是即任蔣的私人機師。</p>

<p>歐戰業談（七）（六）</p>
<h3>英內閣三健將寫照</h3>
<p>人人都知道英國飛機製造部第一要務在收集鋁金。當時聽說英國有缺乏鋁的消息。缺乏的原因乃是部中秘密，然而皮孚勃洛克心理中的反應却很迅速簡單。他說：「假使果有缺乏，我要矯正這個情形。」經他用最足動人的態度發出呼籲，全國數十百萬的主婦，便立刻收集自己家庭中的各種鋁質器具，放在附近的廢物堆上，表示她們的愛戴。她們這樣的急公好義，慷慨爲懷，固然受到感激，然而皮孚勃洛克的所爲却不祗此。他已把國家最緊急的需要陳於國人之前了。因此他所主持的一部便常掛人齒頰，飛機工人亦被抬到公衆目光的最前綫。這决關於鋁金的呼籲，出諸本能，不得不歸功於他早年在每日快報所受的訓練。</p>
<p>其次，因爲皮孚勃洛克熟悉加拿大與美國金融界的內情，故能得到許多有力者的幫助。他要美國飛機，居然就能得到美國飛機，且將逐月增加數量。但他並沒有表示過份的樂觀。憂愁困難，和勞苦工作，都是他所十分重視的。</p>
<p>當他厭倦了「强盜男爵」和「傳道牧師」的角色時，皮孚勃洛克常喜做一個搖頭的悲觀者。他扮演這樣的角色，却給與他以發生很大作用的機會。然而他最後把頭略搖一搖之後，便把英國最近飛機製造數量發表出來，於是他就露齒而笑了。這是皮孚勃洛克最大的秘密。在他寫字檯上每天的數目字足以代表世界工業史上稀有的競賽。</p>
<p>有一個美國新聞記者問着「馬克期是代表什麼？」</p>
<p>一個曾在弗利脫街和皮孚勃洛克同過事的英國人答道，「代表最高數量。」</p>
<p>美國新聞記者道了聲「多謝」，便把他記了下來。其實呢，「馬克斯」一字乃是「馬克斯威爾」一字的縮寫，並不代表什麼呀。</p>
<p>現在要講英內閣中其餘兩位健將了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾首相在唐寗街十號相府的時候，假使有一僩德國駕駛員，毫不經意的投下一顆炸彈，多數英國人相信，他們下一仟首相，不是五十六歲的勞工大臣貝文，便是五十二歲的保安大臣莫利遜。</p>
<p>貝文身體矮胖，相貌嚴肅，現任勞工大臣。他看上去像</p>
<p>皮孚勃洛克之子媳一頭牛。實際上他也具有許多牛性，他能很快的看破鬥牛戲中屠牛者的詭計，而在幾秒鐘內明瞭全局，假使他能倖免—死，便決不能再把牠牽入圈中了。貝文是一個狡獪的戰略家。他有公牛的勇氣，在紛擾的會塲中，他會聳起廣闊的肩膀，突出粗大的頸項，低倒了頭，兩眼在眼鏡中露出光芒，以與人家鬥智角力。人家都說員文的反對共產黨，比較任何一頭公牛對於赤色的反應還要快呢。</p>
<p>至於保安大臣莫利遜，却像一頭啾啾喞喞的小鳥，面上時常露着微笑。他對於辦事庸碌者却不肯輕易放過，有如麻雀的攫取麵包屑一般。他常似公鷄一樣的昂首伸頭，睥睨一切。他驕傲的本性，使他成爲一個辯駁家而不似一個演說家。他具有工作的絕大能力。他坐在寫字檯前，雙袖捲起，領帶解開，頭髮根根豎起。可是他的頭腦中秩序井然，絲毫小亂，有如編號排列的檔案櫥，無論大小事件，可以一檢即得。</p>
<p>一九四〇年五月加入邱吉爾內閣的七個工黨領袖，他們就是其中的兩個。當時保守黨在下議院仍佔着三分之二的多數，照例英國應當組成一個保守黨內閣，他們竟會加入，眞是一件奇事，然而“治主義比較計算下議院的席數史重要，由此證明了。</p>
<p>他們知道這一次戰爭，乃是全民戰爭，而不是閣員和軍隊的戰爭，所以政府必須代表全體人民，而不僅代表一黨一派。假使要請工人爲民治主義而犧牲，必先令他們深信自己是民治主義的一部份。英國要從事全面戰爭，唯有實行全民政治。英國工人在這許多年的妥協期間，常是反法西斯主義者，他們知道德國工人的遭遇怎樣，他們承認西班牙戰爭僅是此决戰爭的起端，所以極願與法西斯主義奮鬥，但必須負起完全的責任，立在他們所信仰之人的後面。</p>
<p>張伯倫政府已失去全國的信任。保守黨自知威望盡失，不滿人意，欲望作戰有效，非邀請工黨加人政府共負責任不可。邱吉爾羅致工黨份子入閣，並非專取人才主義，而是因爲他們能代表全國人民中的一個重要部份。他們能得工人的信任，所以在政治上頗佔勢力，假使他們失去這種信任，則貝文與莫利遜只不過是兩個幹練人員罷了。</p>
<p>貝文從來沒有當過平常人所謂政治家。英國人在他沒有出任勞工大臣以前，多不知道他的大名，然因他是工會運動的首領，在過去二十年中，却是英國最有勢力人物之一。他本極不喜政治家，自從九三一年麥唐納，史諾登，和湯麥斯背棄勞工邋動之後，更不免嗤之以鼻。（未完）皮孚勃洛克之子媳</p>

<h3>經濟談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>畫線</p>
<p>畫線在近年來　漸為工商界中所採用，其先衹統計工作人員用之。統計之爲世重，爲國民政府成立後之一大成就，亦爲國民政府以前之報章及諸學者提倡之成功。蓋自民國十六年以後，國民政府所屬之內外各機關，年有工作報告，往往藉統計數字圖表，以表示其成績；辦公室中，應客室內，亦常以統計圖表作點綴；胡漢民長立法院時，且有統計月報之編印，選材頗精審，因出於劉季陶所主編，其後則由統計處編行。各學校允而傚之，滿壁圖案，皆爲統計。此風一開，於是大公司商店耳濡目染，亦以爲不可無所裝飾品，經理室內，人事科中，及營業報告書類，固不乏花樣百出之統計圖。雖於統計猶缺乏眞正之認識，但依樣葫蘆，亦固收效匪淺矣。</p>
<p>不念二十餘年前，中國刊物之中，即一粗陋簡單之統計圖，亦不可多得。自商報出版，商業金融新聞中，始有金融商業統計圖表刊布，一時風氣頓開，報章雜誌，踵事仿行，寖成習慣，故今日統計學識圖表固遠較前爲精深博；然一念當初之簡陋工作，其艱難亦不亞於今，蓋無所師承，亦無從商榷，一切惟從書本中得其大略（其時統計畫亦求之不得），跡其形似，從　比擬之，模做之，以待逐步之改進。繪</p>
<p>圖也，而圖紙不可得，方　　眼，一　皆須且爲之，一不愼，稍有墨汚，則全功盡棄。繪圖旣無素養，器械亦多簡陋，欲求其工，憂憂其雞，以視今日之工具完備，使用便利，學有專長者，其難易不可以道里計矣。</p>
<p>應用書線統計工作於市價之升降，在二十年前亦祇兪寶澄（　韶）一人而已。兪以學者而經商，時交易所初開辦，上海證券物品交易所之聲勢垃赫異常，各交易所之開辦，亦風起雲湧，紗花標金證券之買賣，突然稱盛。兪喜做條子，（標金十兩爲一條，故買賣稱爲條。做奢，買賣之代名詞，以買賣爲做交易，故即以做字代表買賣。）逐日就市價之上下升降，實行其畫線工作，以察市面之趨勢。其時之交易所經紀人，市塲上伸手之代理人，及一本小紙簿一枝小鉛筆抄塲帳之學徒，（而今恐亦有不少爲市塲上赫赫之投機家矣）見書有線格之紙張上，點點畫畫，正不知葫蘆裏賣什麼藥，更茫然不解共所以然，只見一線，曲折，上下起伏，有時若奇峯突起，倐爾如山谷下降，遂有比之爲市塲畫符，亦有以爲徒費精神，無甚用處。此外只日本商人，亦多有在市塲實行其　線工作，他已不可多觀。不意經年深月久之功夫，亦有知畫線工作，便於觀察，乃亦竊相仿傚，試之果有用，於是亙相傳播，善用其心思者，遂多以畫線工作爲研究趨勢之用。近且見有論畫線之專書問世，行見畫線工作，愈加普遍。不禁廻首前塵，廿年駒光，工商界之經營方式，固有不少之進步，爲之竊喜。</p>
<p>中國舊時工商界對於市價之趨勢，雖無畫線等工作，以資比較研究，亦自有共經騐，頗能億」屬中。其最所重者爲關口，此則與畫線作觀察，有其大同小異處。關口，何謂也；係從俗語而漸沿用於買賣，幾已成爲商業名詞矣。蓋關口所以阻隔內外，盤究奸宄，稽徵市稅，行旅之出於是途者，遂有進關出關盤關等種種名目，小兒之遊戲，戲劇之表演，口頭之道白，亦有把住關口，逃出潼關，文昭關，……不一其說之關。商塲中乃以所預測之市價，將來所欲到之數目，謂之關。如某種商品今已在一百五十五元左右盤旋，則假定以一百六十元爲關口，若竄出關，則市價尚有上升之可能。反之盤旋而下，甚至跌至一百五十元，亦有以爲跌進關，或許有重下之趨勢·惟其所謂關者無一定，大致言零數者以整爲關，言小數者以大數爲關，一視商人之假定爲何如耳！</p>
<h3>糖蘿葡</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>糖蘿葡的拉丁學名叫Beta　Vulgaris，我國又稱它爲甜菜，莙蓮采，或砂糖萊菔等。我以爲只有「糖蘿葡」這一名稱能把它的特性表現得恰到好處，所以題目採用了它。它是原產在南默地中海沿岸的一種屬於藜科的蔬類植物：野生狀態的有十餘種，園圃栽種的只有它和另外一種不生塊根而莖葉可佐盤餐的它的一位同胞兄弟。現在祇簡略述一述它的形態吧。</p>
<p>糖蘿葡的葉作卵形，邊緣上有很深的缺刻，質厚，有葉柄。夏天，長出一公尺上下的莖來，莖上分枝，在葉腋或梢上，開多數黃綠色的五出的小花，呈長穗狀花序；花是雄蕊五枚雌蕊一枚，花後結實，被原來的花萼包裹着。然而人最應該加以注意的，當然還是它那地下作紡棰形的肉質塊根了：這種同蘿葡相似而却含着糖質的塊根，有紅，黃，白，淡紅各色，含糖量各不相同；大致說起來，露在地面上的一節塊根，富於含氣物，沒有糖分；藏在地下面的纔有糖質。</p>
<p>現在有一個不易解決的生物學上的問題：就是和糖蘿葡同種的那些野生狀態的，或連以前說過的那也在園圃中栽種的那一種Beta　Vulgaris，它們的根全是非常織細微弱的，怎麼惟獨糖蘿葡的根知道囤積養料，而能够發揚光大到這麼頓預臃腫的地步呢？—胡蘿葡和野生狀態的根的分別同此。——據法國自然科學家Cortiere的意見。：這不能獨歸功於「人的培養，」因爲另外那一種也是從多少世紀來就受人的培養的，可是它的根並沒有發達膨脹起來。那應該歸功於什麼呢？第一，野生狀態植物的根，原來就有這擊粗變大的傾向；第二，偶然而又偶然的受了異花受精—雜交—的影響，而遂把這種優點繼續保存下來。用天演學說的名詞來表示，就是這完全是「天擇」的結果。這件事情，據晚近科學家用「優生學」的見地去實地試騐的結果，已竟得到充分的證明了：譬如它的含糖量，也能因着優生的法子，叫它由原來百分之四的如增到百分之十八或二十！這不是很淸楚的一個註脚麼？</p>
<p>糖蘿葡這種寶貴的植物，最初埋沒在榛莽當中，不爲人們所欣賞，注意，至多只是充當牛羊牲畜的草料罷了；大概是德國人首先拿它當生菜吃，或者把它刴成零碎的小塊，和臠切的鷄肉一同燒着吃。眞的，它那甜蜜蜜的滋味，紅頳頳的顏色，至今還爲歐洲大部分人，允其是德俄兩國人民所最喜歡吃的一種東西哩。據法國人的記載，它在公元十六世紀纔由意大利傳入法國。有那時一位名叫Olivier　de　Serres的描述它說：「有和防風一類名叫糖蘿葡的柬西，從意大利傳來不久。這是一種頗肥大的塊根，葉長圓形，一切全可烹調了吃。它的根作紅巴，夾雜在嫩肉當中，烹調時津液殷紅如硃砂，是非常美麗可觀的。」</p>
<p>從多少世紀以來，造糖的特權是被甘蔗所壟斷着的。—不說我國用米孽麥芽所製出的飴。—眞的，它那巍然不可動搖的黃金寶座，有什麼植物敢妄冀非分同它分庭抗禮呢？可是竟有這共貌不揚的糖蘿蔔要來同它一較身手了！原來在公元十八世紀有一僩名叫馬兒格拉夫Marggraff1709-1782）的德國名化學家，學業精深，二十九歲時已竟被選爲柏林國立科學院的會員。他在公元一七四七年發表他用糖蘿蔔製出純糖的結果，就是他簡單的把曬乾的糖羅蔔圓片浸在酒精裏，然後想法提鍊出它的糖分來。他也證明那種白角的糖蘿蔔，就是他們所稱爲「西里西亞省種」的，含糖量最爲豐富，的合本身重量的百分之七。他也預言將來人能够從甘蔗以外的植物提取出純糖的希望。</p>
<p>馬兒格拉夫在學術上的試騐雖說成功，可是這種不特事倍功半的工作，離工業上實用的道路還算遠着呢。幸而繼承他的志向作努力的研究的，有他的門弟子亞沙爾（Achard1753-1821）：他也是著名的化學家兼自然科學家，爲柏林國立科學院物理系的主任。他在公元一七八六年，得到由普王贈給他的一塊農業試騐田，—在柏林附近—遂廣植糖蘿蔔以供試騐。是他首先於一八〇二年在西里西亞省創建之第一座糖蘿葡造糖廠，而把他老師馬兒格拉夫的製糖法子改良，和把他的理想實現起來。眞的，用糖蘿蔔製糖眞正成功的光榮，是應該歸他享受的。</p>
<p>不要忘了這公元十八十九世紀之交，是法國大革命和緊接着拿破崙第橫行歐洲的時期。法國人所吃的蔗搪，以前完全是西印度羣　中它的屬島像海地等　供給的。—那時海地島是執着世界產糖地帶的牛耳而位居第一的。—可是法國在它革命的初期，已竟和英國兵戎相見了；英國仗恃它那廣多的艦隊，海上的覇權，便把法國和它殖民地的交通生生截斷，蔗糖的供給當然發生嚴重問題了。法國也以爲自己殖民地的蔗糖不能運輸，凡能輸入的東西全是百世不解之仇的敵人英國人所經營的，於是便向蔗糖課以極重的稅額，以事報復：譬如最初每一百公斤蔗糖課稅一百法郎，最後直提高到蔗糖價值的百分之五十！稅額愈高，私運的風氣愈熾，海關上後來反一無所獲。然而蔗糖的供不應求，大大缺少和貴璽的情形也可想而知了。及至拿破崙第一得勢，和英國的競爭愈演愈烈：他也如同現在的希特勒一樣，是恨不得把英倫三島一舉而蕩平之的。可是公元一八〇五年，在西班牙南部Trafalgar灣的一戰，他的海軍完全被英將納爾遜所傾覆，直接征服英國的計劃變成泡影，他不得已纔於一八〇六年宣佈「大陸封鎖政策」，禁止英國一切的商品在歐陸上出售，想用經濟戰以困英國：於是蔗糖這在民生日用上佔那麼重要位置的寶貴食品，更幾乎絕跡於歐陸的市塲了！</p>
<p>糖這種東西，雖說比不得柴米油鹽等，以致人「得之則生「弗得則死；然而它在十九世紀的歐洲，也早已變成開門幾件事之一，爲人生所絕不可少的必需品了·現在因大陸封鎖的緣故，竟至影斷跡絕，你想歐陸上的人民要感覺多麼大的痛苦吧。就是那震撼全歐洲的魔王拿破崙第一，亦何嘗不感覺出口蔗糖的重要性而要設法彌補這種缺憾呢？於是巴黎「獎勵本國工業協會」成立了，對於蔗糖的代替品也縣賞以徵求之了。實話說。，有了這種大有力的提倡和獎勵，糖蘿葡裝糖工業纔能一鳴驚人一飛冲天的邁上了實用的大道。吾則它要伈伈俔俔永遠雌伏下去也水可知哩！</p>
<p>法國在十八世紀後半期，已竟得到那所謂西里西亞種的糖蘿葡；公元一七九九年，普國人亞沙爾從糖蘿葡中提鍊出純粹糖質的消息，也傳遍了法國的學術界和工商界：可是就是在法國最高學府那所謂「國立科學院」中，也有許多人不肯相信而嗤之以鼻的！現在呢？爲時勢所迫，有許多人不能不埋下頭去，以接續亞沙爾的工作了。公元一八一〇年，有一個叫Deyeux的藥物學家，把從糖蘿葡裏製造出來的兩塊糖奉獻給拿破崙；又有一個名叫Derosne　的，把他創造的機器和糖，贈送給巴黎獎勵工業協會，然而這時的糖蘿葡出糖量，不過佔原料的百分之四而已。　接着那活動力非常偉人的大銀行家Delessert（1773-1847），在巴黎附近的Passy鎭，建設了第一痤糖蘿葡製糖廠；不久以後，他自己獨力統共創設了二十一座！所以在一八一二年時，全法國已竟有了這秤糖廠共四十座了。拿破崙第一爲的鼓勵人參加這種事業起見，親自往Passy鎭參觀Delessert的製糖工廠。他也聽了首相名化學家Chaptal的勸告，當着那些目瞪口呆的工人面前，親手把自己胸前佩帶的十字動章摘下來，然後親手在Delessert的胸前，並且把糖廠製出的糖，一律免稅五年以示獎勵！根據Chaptal的統計，這座糖廠因爲沒有同業和它競爭，共費去兩萬五千法郎，壓榨了五十萬公斤的糖蘿葡，利息得到百分之二十五。</p>
<p>公元一八一四和一八一五年，拿破崙第一失敗，法國本殖民地的蔗糖和外國的蔗糖，又潮水般的湧到法國，以致進口稅的比例由三三〇降落至四四。那新興的糖蘿葡製糖工業，當然抵禦不了這無情的打擊，而霎時一落千丈了。不過這種打擊雖然重大，並不是致命的，並沒有把糖蘿葡製糖工業置之死地。反之，這種工業，利用拿破崙第一只豁免它五年的稅捐，復辟的法國政府不加注意，而它却把這種優權一直享受下去：所以實話說，它不聲不響在暗地裹的滋生繁榮，却並沒有一日停止哩。人算計着：法國在公元一八二五年，已竟有這種製糖工廠的百家之譜；一八二九年的產糖，還只等於本國消費量的十六之一哩；不久，大的在一八三五年，已竟年產糖四百九十萬公斤，而全國的消費量亦只是五百九十萬公斤而已！</p>
<p>糖蘿葡的製糖工業旣然蒸蒸日上，法國海外的種棺甘蔗家和海上運輸業，視爲莫大的威脅，便齊心努力的向政府方面進攻；結果，糖蘿葡製糖工業也加上了無情的稅捐；甚至有一决法國內閣受了英國政府的壓力，幾乎在「睦鄰」的口號下面禁止了在法國本部製造這種土糖！無論怎樣吧：法國的糖蘿葡製糖工業，在重重束縛種種困難之下，仍能突飛猛晋，以致到了公元一八七五年，產糖量已昇到四十五萬噸，而是在全歐洲的國家中首屈一指</p>
<p>同時從公元一八五〇年以來，有一個名叫Louis　deVilmorin的法國科學家，超時代的　在奧國大遺傳學家Mendel以前，已竟知道用人工擇配的法子改良糖蘿葡種子，而造出許多優良的種類來。而且「騐糖計」的發明，也對於化學家有莫大的助力。所以在一八六一年Louis　de　Vllmoriu竟得到一種出糖量佔百分之十六的糖蘿葡比較普國最優良的類種還超過一倍呢。史足以錦上添花的，是有一個名叫Rillieux的美國人，發明了一種　造糖機器，能節省無數的　能，對於糖蘿葡製糖工業也算助了很大的一臂之力哩。</p>
<p>最可惜的是法國這種製糖工業，在一八七五年達到最高峯以後，便馬上衰落下來，由第一位退居到第四位：原因是Louis　de　Vilmorin用人工得到的含糖量豐富的優良糖蘿葡種子，不爲水國所重，沒有人栽培它；而且徵稅制度的不合理由是一種很大的障碍，因爲法國微稅，是按製出之糖量計算的，用去的原料在所不問；至於其他各國像德俄奧等，聽說Louis　de　Vilmorin的改良糖蘿葡種子，便馬上栽培起來；而它們的徵稅制度呢，是按壓榨罷了的糖蘿葡的渣濘計算，以致製糖工業家以多出糖少留糟粕爲莫大的利益，，無形中把出糖量給提高了。况且出糖量超過了某某限度，國家還有特別的補助金哩。這種賢明的舉措，不久就把它們的出糖量給提高了一倍！法國要不是急起直追，在一八八叫年一切也採取了外國的辦法，恐怕不但不能保持它那產糖業的第四位，就是完全破產也說不淸哩。</p>
<p>總結一句吧：在第一决歐戰前，歐洲各國對於糖蘿葡製糖的出產量，全已達到了百分之十八的水準。德國出產最多，年達二百七十萬噸，其决是俄國，年產二百萬噸；奧國屬第三，年產一百三十七萬五千噸；法國居第四，年產九十六萬噸。最近還是納粹的德國，一向　持着那光榮的第一把交椅：可是現在呢，恐怕它已竟把這能够爲人羣造福利的製糖工廠，一變而爲製造飛機大砲和一切屠段人類工具的地方吧</p>

<h3>衛生修學法（上）（寫給大中學生）</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>在現代的中國、誠然不能像從前閉關時代一樣、抱着我行我素惟我獨尊的態度、而是要效法他人的長處、來補自己的短處的、但是最要緊的、是在取人的長處、而不放棄自已的長處、不是徒事模仿、而是在能創造、不是將自己同化於人、而是在如何適應現在的環境、現在他目不談、僅就衛生學來講、孔夫干說過「士志於道、而恥惡衣惡食者、未足與議也、」又說、「士而懷居、不足以爲士矣、」可見我國古之十君子別有懷抱、對於衣食住、並不十分重視的、可是自從西學東漸、孔子學設、已經束之高閣、衣食住遂成爲衛生問題的中心、物質文明的表現、於是衣必講求輕暖、食必再三選擇、務求其容易消化、富於滋養、夏必赴海濱避暑、冬必赴溫泉頣養、以爲不如此不是衛生、不知此種衛生、已成老生常談、時代落伍、今日國難當頭、完全不適用了、</p>
<p>今日之靑年、即將來復興民族之份子、大中學生、正當發育之年、對於衛生、允其不可誤解其意義、作者本醫學立塲、爲諸君講說衛生原理、原來人生大地之間、無時無刻、不在艱苦之中討生活、風寒暑濕燥火的刺激、各種病菌的侵襲、均是人類的外侮、而我們四肢白體的每一個細胞、都具有抵抗外侮的能力、似乎目然界對於我們一切生物、都給與一種壞的環境、而同時又給與我們一種抵抗壞環境的工具、抵抗得過去、就適宜於這種環境、即謂之適應、就可以圖生存、抵抗不過去、那就是不知道適應、不適宜於這種環境、就歸於滅亡之路、可是這種抵抗能力、適應機能、可以訓練得來、愈抵抗、愈會抵抗、愈適應、愈會適應、反過來說、這種抵抗能力適應牌能、因不練習而會消失、愈不抵抗、愈不會抵抗、愈不適應、愈不會適應、所以衛生的眞正意義、就是在如何訓練我們的抵抗能力適應機能、</p>
<p>根據這個原則、我們可以談談大中學生的衛生修學法、一·刻古　俗語說得好、「吃得苦中苦、方爲人上人、」孟子也說過「故天之將降大任於斯人也、必先苦其心志、勞其筋骨、餓其體膚、空乏其身、行怫亂共所爲、所以動心忍性、增益其所不能、」這些話歸總起來、就在增益其所不能」一句、人所不能處的環境我能處、人所不能吃的苦我能吃、假使沒有充分的抵抗力、如何能够達到這個目的呢、蔡禹門先生說過、一隆冬之際、應常薄其衣、不必重裘、更不必烤火、務使皮膚慣受嚴寒、更以冷水拭身、可使皮膚增强其調節作用、如是加以練習、則逢氣候之驟變、即不易犯感冒、反之如常裹厚衣、則稍犯寒風、即罹感冒、故在平素若於寒氣之調節作用不知練習、即易失去自然機能之素養、又如平日宜常吃硬物、即不易消化之物、亦不必絕對禁忌、使胃腸平日能練習增强其工作、否則一味小心冀翼、不敢稍吃不易消化者、則其胃部即慣於輕鬆之動作、稍遇不消化物、即不能勝任其勞、本來胃並不弱者、因過於謹愼、而反致變弱、」又如行路、最好安步當車、不必時覔代步、凡此種種、皆所以刻苦自勵、臥薪嘗膽之義也、</p>

<h3>學徒自修的權利</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>世界上的幸與不幸，與其說是由境遇來決定，母寗說是由有沒有奮鬥的精神來決定。</p>
<p>與西裝革履，手挾洋書入校求學的靑年比較起來，商店的學徒也許是不幸的。然而身爲學徒的靑年並不必因此自餒，學徒的前途無需受這種環境上的不幸所限制。</p>
<p>俄國的文豪高爾基，不是學徒出身的嗎？美國的科學家兼政治家佛蘭克林，不也是從商店裏出來的嗎？憑着他們好學進取的精神，學徒的生活成爲他們進步的一個階段，變做他們成功的基石。</p>
<p>高爾基與佛蘭克林的天才，當然不是每個人所能有的。因此有奮鬥的精神的學徒不一定每一個都能一舉成名。然而一個人的成功與吾，並不是由他的聲名來衡量的。時間，機會與能力的盡量利用，才是成功的標準。</p>
<p>學徒業餘的讀書與自修，是人類所應享受的合理權利，因爲進取之心，是人所共有的，決不是頑固的思想與經濟的壓力所能摧殘得了的。</p>

<h3>「以不變應萬變」！</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>陪都最近盛呼着一句非常實際化的口號：——以不變應萬變！</p>
<p>這是我們的領袖倡說的。因爲國際形勢，早變夕更，若要跟着跑，只好整天鬧着開會了。可是領袖認爲已定國策，絕對不因環境轉移，始終以「不變」應付紛至沓來的「萬變」。短短的歷史，已經吿訴我們，領袖的認識是準確的。</p>
<p>現在，這個關於國策方針的「不變」主義，已經廣泛地成了陪都人民的生活原則了。似乎誰都會咬緊牙關地吿訴您一聲：「不變」！</p>
<p>許多外埠的人會想：陪都，這緊張的工作，這高昂的生活，這可怕的空襲，大概他們都像熱鍋中的螞蟻那般忐忑了？實際，您瞧，陪都像微波，像夜鶯，像　文詩，平靜得你相信不來！這就是「不變」的果子。</p>
<p>歐陽小姐不是你那級中最摩登的位嗎？吿訴你，她現在也在學習「不變」了（當然，這不是說摩登不變，乃是說再不變作摩登人物了）。聽她說：</p>
<p>「兩件布衫，却退色了，我想做兩件新的，但是，士林布要一元八毛錢一尺哩！後來我想把舊的複染一下吧，可是，每件染費又得六塊錢。好，還是仍舊穿上那件退色的吧！」</p>
<p>實際上，歐陽小姐所做的，還不是內地一般人民的寫眞？要在「行頭」上趕上時代，已不是我們所願的了。芳剛從香港來，說了一大堆燙髮的什麼花籃式，雲梯式，把我們笑的幾乎牙根都掉了。別瞧不起我們的捲香蕉髮，着實大方哩！</p>
<p>兩年來，我們這機關的薪給還是「不變」，可是我們並不氣餒，在精神十還他個「不變一！政府供給我們「公米」，（每石三十元）　的間題解決了，還求什麼　他？</p>
<p>口袋裏個錢也沒有，嘴裏還在哼進　曲，陪　就是多這班人！我們並不是樂天派，這乃是心裏堅强的流露！</p>
<p>可以說，陪都的同胞已經領會：個人的意志和力量是平面的，集體的纔是立體的；所以「集中意志」和「集中力量」會成作勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>「不變應萬變」，從口號而化作生活，陪都人民在「集中意志」方面，至少這是一個成就。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3>手提噴火器</h3>
<p>— 思中</p>
<p>德軍在巴爾榦半島作戰時，曾使用一種手提噴火器，使我國曉得現代的戰塲上又有了一種最可怕的新武器。那種武器，由專家設計製成，共有五種用途。使用它的兵士，受過特別訓練，穿着避火的石綿衣服，以免自己受傷。</p>
<p>噴火器的基本作用是噴射火熖和燒得滾燙的油。同時吐出有毒的一氧化碳，這種　體在密不通風的地方，能致人死命。它父能吸盡空氣中的氧氣，使坦克車不能前進，因爲坦克車的馬述，一定需要氧氣。另一種作用是迭成有效的烟幕，掩護使用它的兵士。最後一種用途是使士氣大爲沮喪，無心作戰。</p>
<p>這種德國人發明的噴火器在軍隊向坦克車和暗砲臺襲擊的時候，功效最佳。一道一道的火熖，從坦克車和砲臺的開口的地方噴進去，簡直可可以使坦克車和砲裏面，熱得像火爐一樣。縱使裏面的兵士，能忍得住，但是發燄的熱油，順着缺口往裏鑽，便能產生一氧化碳。</p>
<p>手提噴火器的最遠射程是一百多英尺。每具連續噴火叫十决，每决的火燄維持人的一秒鐘。使用它的兵士、背部縛着兩個筒，一個裝油？個裝壓縮空氣。當兵士打開通氣活瓣的時候，油從噴嘴中射出來，過着一根導火錢，便點着了</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>

<p>「人總是有良心的。」他自己的爸爸已對尙老二開出了那樣優待的條件，尙老二也是一個人，良心總不致沒有，但能仔細想想，便未必再會找來糾纏了。</p>
<p>常陰曆正月十四的一天，她在嚮午的時候，跟王舍監和三個先到的寄宿生喝了一兩杯酒，大家不覺都把興致提起來了，王舍監便說：</p>
<p>「反正學堂現在還沒有開課，而且又在大正月，咱們今兒就放肆一下吧。梅影，聽說你唱的戲很好，快唱一段給我們聽聽！」</p>
<p>老師這麼一說，其餘二個學生那還肯讓梅實推辭嗎？</p>
<p>梅寳一來禁不住那三個同學扭糖人兒的死纏，一來自己也喝了些酒，多少已有四五分醉意，便果然依着她們，不用胡琴，空口乾唱了一段「祭塔。」</p>
<p>唱完之後，大家當然父異口同聲的在讚了她一陣。</p>
<p>「是誰敎給你的？梅影。」方舍監斜乜着一雙老花眼，用一種很糢糊的醉音問，平時她那種精明嚴謹的態度已不知看到那裹去了。</p>
<p>「最初是有一個師傳敎的。」提到師傳兩個字，梅寳的心，便不自覺地跳了一跳。「去年冬天回去，我爸爸時高興，又給我說了好幾齣，他敎的倒比師傳敎的還好得多。因爲他……」</p>
<p>梅寳乘着酒興，正想一路敞着嘴，把那些眞情全說出來的時候，門房裏的校工陳大突然奔進了膳廳來。（一九六）</p>

<h3>飛行電衣</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>現代飛行學中有一重要而頗難解決之間題，即飛行員之衣着是。蓋在高空中，溫度往往較地而爲低，因是航空人員於飛行時，乃不得不穿着極厚之笨重衣服，然此種服裝，對於駕駛方面，頗爲不便。最近美國發明家，已製造新式電衣一種，輕巧利便，以電流保持衣服之溫度。即使溫度在零點下華氏六十度之高空中，飛行員之體溫，仍能保持常態。此種電衣，現已試騐成功，並已由美國陸軍當局予以採用云。</p>
<p>倘若德軍果欲進犯英倫，他們大概又要用出這種法寳。主要的用意是使民氣頹喪，並減低抵抗力。</p>

<p>— 姜志剛</p>
<p>爲什麼男的總比女的長些？我先吿訴你，這不是生理上的問題，而是嚴重的，社會制度的問題！一位「課外導師以爲這是「男性中心制度所造成的！」這是爲了營養上的原內。在以男子爲中心的封建社會裏面，女子處在男子的壓迫下而。一切好的，優美的享用，總儘先讓男子暢快地享受了，才輪得到女子。當初的差別雖然極小，小到幾平看不出來，但經過幾百，幾十代以後，女子自然就比男子矮了。</p>

<p>社會</p>
<h3>好老闆</h3>
<p>— 江水</p>
<p>美國芝加哥城有一位名叫輿托，愛許姆的，一般人都叫他作『全美國最好的老闆』。O·E，這裏就用伙計們所慣用的稱呼來叫他吧，在芝城開設着一家植物油公司；他的公司，就像是一個甜蜜的家庭一樣。公司方面每天把早餐免費地供給各員工；O·E自己就與他們坐在一張桌上進食，談着笑着，並且出及每個伙計對於公司有無不滿的地方，如果感到有不滿意的，則儘管可以向老闆大胆說出，以便從事改良—但歷來除了大家啜咖啡的聲音之外，總沒聽見過一句怨語。在公司的底層，O·E還設置了一個遊戲間，裏面備有乒乓與撲克，供職工們在業餘玩要。對於女職員，這位老闆允其可謂討好，每月他老要送她們許多書籍，糖果與化裝品，襪子等等。每屆年終，他就給每個伙計以一封信，裏面吿訴他（或她）有些什麼應該改進的地方。職工們都得寫回信給他，回答他的觀察有無錯誤。</p>
<p>自從一九一一年該公司成立以來，這老闆就沒辭退過一個職工，或减過一决工資。職工方面也從沒有過一决爭吵或罷工。O·E還利用他的餘暇在寫歷史書。他相信：祇有職工與經理間有相互的瞭解與共同的合作，才能使營業蒸蒸日上。</p>

<h3>隱形飛機</h3>
<p>— 閎</p>
<p>最近來自歐洲的報吿，說英國通常用以轟炸德國工業中心的轟炸機，是用某種新發明的油漆漆過的，地面上的探照燈照着這種飛機，他們就好像隱形一樣地看不見了。</p>
<p>根據另一報吿，說美國軍隊已在應用一種特別的淡黃色油漆，這種油漆吸收光綫，所以漆過的飛機即使被探照燈照着，反射到敵人眼中的光綫也殆近於無。</p>
<p>日間用的飛機，機身上漆着兩種顏色，腹部漆着青色，以便和天色混淆，背部漆着較深的顏色，以便和陸地的顏色混淆，靠着這種方法，上面和下面的敵人，部很難看見機身子。</p>

<h3>菊國春秋</h3>
<p>— 少閒</p>
<p>程玉菁風流韻事多（下）</p>
<p>故都有兩大巨賈，就是同仁堂（北方著名藥舖）樂家，和瑞蚨祥（北平最大之綢緞莊）孟家，樂孟二家，非但是富商，而且是戲迷。單說瑞蚨祥孟家吧，掌櫃（即老闆）的孟大爺，常年爲捧徐碧雲，所耗不下十數萬金，這位孟大爺專寵甚多，第四房姨太太，有一個養女，叫張梅雲，從小就愛唱戲，孟大爺故後，這位四姨太太索性就讓梅雲正式拜了師傳，她的開蒙師是李緝之，（王瑤卿的弟子，就是張君秋的師傳李凌楓。）那時張梅雲不過十幾歲，她的藝術如何暫且不論，然而小妮子的愛好風流，却不能不提。當時她因爲向李緝之學戲緣故，間接得到和張君秋見面的機會，而她竟會愛上了君秋。李緝之呢？對於君秋期望旣殷，管敎夙嚴，當然不能坐視不管。爲了避免麻煩起見，李緝之竟因爲這一層，而謝絕敎張梅雲的戲。</p>
<p>孟家四姨太太住在大馬神廟，王瑤卿家恰巧在孟家對門，張梅雲時常到瑤卿家裏去，瑤卿家裏的人都管她叫孟家小妹妹，自從李緝之不敎梅雲的戲以後，梅雲常到王家去和瑤卿討敎，而且想拜瑤卿爲師，但是瑤卿因爲她是緝之的徒弟，爲了輩份的關係，不能收她。但是她以小孩子天眞的姿態，自說自話的叫瑤卿「師傳」，瑤卿因爲她是小孩子，所以她糊裏糊塗的叫，瑤卿也就糊裏糊塗的答應；於是一般人也就默認張梅雲是瑤卿的徒弟了。而瑤卿自己也正因爲當她是個徒弟，所以叫「大師兄」程玉菁代表去敎她戲，孰斜這位大師兄醉翁之意不在酒，竟以敎戲爲名，和梅雲發生苟且，甚至於梅雲一連打過三决胎，直到最近，他們彼此似乎已到不能在隱瞞下去的局面，於是玉菁就公開向瑤卿陳說，要娶梅雲爲妾，而瑤卿因爲王菁現在尙不能維持一妻的生活，何能再另外納妾？極力的向玉菁規勸，同時更因爲玉菁的妻子華慧雯聞訊之下，屢决到瑤卿面前來哭訴，所以瑤鄉更堅決的對於此事表示不能贊同。孰料玉菁竟因為瑤卿的極力反對，而懷恨在心，演成此决毆師事件。雖然事後玉菁會對人表示此事的發生，側面原因是由於黃桂秋拜師，其實這是他的「賴詞」，說來說去玉菁拈花惹草的本事太大，害了他的一生，這决事情的演變，骨子裏還是由於「桃色」而起的。</p>
<h3>「職業婦女」觀感</h3>
<p>— 譚風</p>
<p>這决有機會看到郵務工會演出的職業婦女，不能不說是件幸事。首先劇本就挑得合適。它是一顆炸彈，以它的力量對惡勢力之下的權威者給以嚴重的打擊；它是一把小刀，以它的鋒口將一般冒牌的正人君子的假面具割得粉碎；然而它也是一盞明燈，以它的光芒引着願意上進的人走十他們正當的方向！</p>
<p>演這個戲是有意義的，以演出者的地位來說，我個人覺得演這戲更有意義。無論從那一方面來看，都可以感到他們的努力。一個業餘劇團能有這樣優美的或績確實可喜。演員最成功的當是飾方局長的陳致通君，發音和動作都能顯出他舞台經騐的豐富。祇是第二幕開始進塲如出塲跑路都嫌太匆忙，似乎與他那以呵欠來表示疲倦有些不協調。陸維華（飾張鳳來），鄭桂生（飾張進中），李頌（飾長福）諸君都有很好的演技。可惜飾賣花女的國譜欠正確；李濟寬的發音太平弱；方以拙過於油滑，李濟猛近乎生硬。其餘尙能稱職。燈光和地位都美。</p>

<p>所以山帶離恨，水含別愁，旅途風景，益增愁懷。異方之昔，不入耳之言，更是令人初怛。到得燕京後，田宏遇搶圓圓至府，上下許多人等一見圓圓明眸皓齒，翠眉朱顏，似這般可喜娘罕曾見，都覺得全家粉黛無顏色，又驚又喜，又妬又羨。田宏遇別闢數間紅樓，安藏圓圓，預備選個吉日，正式納圓圓爲姬人。不料他的女兒田妃聞知伊父親新携江南美人陳圓圓回京，立刻差內監來請他入宮，說有要事面吿。田宏遇不敢怠慢，馬上進宮去見他的女兒。坐定後田宏遇便說「我方從江南掃墓回來，尙沒有來見你，且有幾樣土物，以及南方繡貨送給你。不知你有什麼要緊事情要和我談？」田妃道：「聽得父親此决回家，會迎得一位吳中佳麗，姓陳名圓圓的，欲納爲妾，此事可眞嗎？」田宏遇不由微微一笑，點點頭道：「果有其事。我此番南下，在蘇州小作勾留。一天有興去遊靈岩，恰巧遇見一位麗姝，驚爲絕色，經人告訴後，方知這是艷名久著的陳圓圓。以後遂到伊樓閣中去盤桓數日，未免有情，誰能遺此？所以量珠載還，你要笑我做父親的年老而心不老嗎？哈哈！」田宏遇說到這裏，掀髯而笑。田妃含笑說道：「食色天性，我知道父親雖然年高，而一晌自命多情的，一旦遇此佳麗，怎肯捨去？自然要想把伊藏之金屋，紅袖添香了。」田宏遇笑道：「你說得不錯，可謂知父莫若女了！」又是一聲哈哈。但田妃又對伊父親說道：陳圓圓果是天生麗質，我說句冒昧的話，要向父親，吿借這位佳人給我，不知父親能不能允許我？」（一五三）</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Formally Announces the Dispatch of Military Missions to China and the Soviet Union. To Effectively Assist China as Much as Possible Under the Lend-Lease Act. Foreign Minister Guo Issues Statement of Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 27th (United Press) - Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, in commenting on the U.S. dispatching a military mission to China, told a United Press reporter that "China welcomes the U.S. military mission to China, as this move not only represents an increase in concrete assistance but also symbolizes enhanced cooperation among anti-aggression countries in the Pacific." Guo emphasized that the simultaneous dispatch of military missions to China and the Soviet Union demonstrates that this cooperation will be more resolute than any previous action. U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, in a speech at the Sino-American Cultural Association, also stressed that American assistance will flow continuously to China, adding that such assistance should be brought by China to Free China. Gauss also recalled President Roosevelt's statement on March 15 that the U.S. might immediately expand its assistance to China and provide all possible aid. The U.S. does not give aid lightly, nor does it consider such aid a light matter. This aid is about to arrive in China, and after its arrival, it will rely on your ability to transport it into the country. This is to provide appropriate personnel to assist China under the Lend-Lease Act, and to contribute opinions and suggestions as much as possible to make it effective, so that both China and the United States benefit, and to contribute to the world's efforts to resist all acts of aggression by force. The President also stated that the government intends to dispatch another similar mission to the Soviet Union, with the same objectives as the one sent to China." He also mentioned that the "authorities" he referred to, other than the Chinese side, actually referred to territorial authorities of other countries, such as Burma, as these places are necessary routes for the transportation of raw materials to China. He also noted that this also applies to the Soviet Union. Observers believe that the President's words indicate that the U.S. delegation to the Soviet Union will also discuss everything with other relevant authorities, such as the Middle East region, although the President did not explicitly point this out. After meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Dr. Hu Shi stated that the President had decided to send a military mission to China to investigate supply issues and military strategy. Dr. Hu, in commenting on his meeting with President Roosevelt, said, "Most of what I discussed with the President concerned China's needs (needs during China's resistance). The President assured me that he and Churchill did not forget the issue of China's needs during their historic meeting. Overall, I am very satisfied with my meeting with the President." It is noted that General Magruder is currently 54 years old, served as a military attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Peiping from 1920 to 1924, and as a senior attaché from 1926 to 1930. He taught military technology at the Virginia Military Institute for four years and served as a military attaché in Bern from 1939 until he was assigned to Fort Drum on December 28 of last year.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt, when hosting news reporters yesterday, announced the dispatch of a military mission to China, stating that the dispatch of this mission is the same as the mission to the Soviet Union, currently under consideration, and that they are parallel and have the same purpose, except that the mission to the Soviet Union does not handle assistance under the Lend-Lease Act. The mission to China is expected to depart within half a month. Its duties are (1) to consult with China and other authorities to study the military situation within China and its needs for military equipment; (2) to compile an itemized list of the types and quantities of materials needed; (3) to assist in the procurement of these needed materials domestically and their delivery to China; and (4) to propose recommendations of an appropriate nature to ensure that assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act is as effective as possible, benefiting the efforts of the U.S., China, and the world to resist the movement of armed conquest. The leader of this mission will be General Magruder, who has served as a military attaché in China twice and has many years of experience, so he will surely be able to work harmoniously with people who are already acquainted with each other.</p>
<p>The U.S. Continues to Adopt a Firm Policy in the Far East</p>
<p>Chongqing, 27th (Reuters) - The announcement by President Roosevelt of the dispatch of a military mission to China, as well as the Soviet Union's warning to Japan, have been warmly welcomed here. It is believed that this will dispel the doubts recently held by some people here about the possibility of the U.S. continuing to attempt to appease Japan. According to the Chinese interpretation, this new mission will not only demonstrate the U.S.'s willingness to cooperate closely with the Chinese government but also prove the U.S.'s lack of hesitation in taking steps that are bound to offend Japan. The Chinese side points out that there is currently the closest cooperation between Washington and Chongqing, because in addition to the aforementioned U.S. military mission, several important U.S. missions have come to Chongqing, including the air force mission led by General Claire Chennault, the transportation mission led by Arne Schelven, and Lattimore, the personal advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Fund Board, who are still in Chongqing. Chinese figures here have expressed satisfaction with the statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hull that the solution to the Far East situation must be based on the fourteen points he issued in July 1937. Hull also condemned the use of force as an instrument of national policy and interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>Washington, 26th - Observers believe that the U.S. dispatching a delegation indicates that U.S. aid to China is becoming more active and firm. Afterwards, the U.S. will continue to adopt a firm policy to prevent further Japanese actions in the Far East.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (United Press) - The Washington Times-Herald reported yesterday that the U.S. dispatching a military delegation to China was the result of negotiations led by Soong Tzu-wen, who represented China in obtaining supplies under the Lend-Lease Act. However, Soong refused to issue a statement regarding Wu's mission. He only said that he was very pleased with President Roosevelt's decision to send a military delegation to Chongqing. Apart from this, Soong refused to make any other comments to American reporters. Washington, 27th (International News Service) - After President Roosevelt announced the dispatch of a military mission to China, he immediately invited Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Hu Shi to inform him of this matter. Ambassador Hu immediately expressed gratitude on behalf of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek that the Anglo-American conference had not neglected China. According to news from Chongqing, Chinese officials have welcomed the appointment of General Magruder as the head of the delegation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Reuters) - According to the Japanese news agency, sources close to the Foreign Ministry said today that the U.S. sending a military mission to Chongqing is an unfriendly act towards Japan, and this move contradicts the British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast speech in which he said that Britain and the United States are willing to peacefully resolve the existing problems with Japan.</p>
<h3>Australian Cabinet Decides Not to Resign</h3>
<p>Canberra, 27th (United Press) - The Cabinet meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM last night. Prime Minister Menzies refused to issue a statement. However, authoritative sources claim that the government will not resign. After the Labor Party rejected the Prime Minister's proposal to form a national government including all parties, it requested Menzies to resign and allow the Labor Party to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>Canberra, 27th (Reuters) - The Australian Cabinet's decision not to resign has been communicated to the Labor Party. It is expected that the Labor Party will express opposition to Prime Minister Menzies in the Lower House today. Although Menzies seemed tired, he was still cheerful. Last night he told people that although the Labor Party had resolved to oppose him going to London again, he had not changed his attitude. If there is a change, he will announce it in due course.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Rebukes Rumors</h3>
<p>Washington, 27th (Reuters) - A reporter asked President Roosevelt for his opinion on rumors of the misuse of Lend-Lease Act funds. The President replied that someone was obviously organizing a propaganda campaign to spread rumors and slander in order to undermine the process of aiding those resisting Hitler. The President asked about the content of the rumors. A reporter told him about reports that the British were squandering money extravagantly in Washington restaurants. The President said that the British would never seek compensation from Lend-Lease Act funds. The President also mentioned the spreading of rumors, saying that the sections described by Reuters were good evidence.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The U.S. Military Mission to China</h3>
<p>The U.S. military mission, led by General Magruder, had been rumored for several days, but it was only confirmed by President Roosevelt yesterday when he hosted news reporters. This move is clearly one of the important policies determined in the Atlantic Charter meeting. Upon learning of this exciting news, we instinctively deeply recognize how firm the wise policies of the United States are, and the military experts who will strike a blow at the violence in the Far East have now truly embarked on their journey. All the doubts that have arisen in recent days due to the U.S.-Japan negotiations have now been completely cleared up. Studying the significance of this move, we have the following impressions:</p>
<p>First, the greatest principle decided by Roosevelt and Churchill at the Atlantic Conference was to divide the task of defeating the two violent forces in the East and West between the United States and Britain. The United States has taken on the arduous task in the East. British Prime Minister Churchill has repeatedly issued statements that if a conflict occurs between the U.S. and Japan, Britain will definitely assist the U.S. This guarantee clearly implies the mission that the U.S. will undertake in the Pacific in the future. The United States recently stated that if the British and Soviets are militarily successful in Iran, the U.S. Pacific Fleet will not leave the Pacific and will escort military supplies from the U.S. West Coast to Britain and the Soviet Union, via British Malaya to India and the Persian Gulf, and then across Iran or the Caspian Sea to the southeastern part of the Soviet Union. From this perspective, the U.S., in order to strengthen the connection of the democratic front and for military needs, really needs to study the strategies and general situations of various countries.</p>
<p>Second, the world considers the recent U.S.-Japan talks as a disguised revival of the appeasement policy. Although Washington has repeatedly explained its consistent policy and determination to safeguard the Nine-Power Treaty, China fundamentally doubts the principles of these negotiations. Now, the U.S. is sending a military mission to China to undertake practical work, which can completely dispel these doubts. In essence, it confirms that the appeasement policy has been completely eliminated, and the U.S. will never compromise with Japan. Hull once clearly told Nomura, "If Japan continues to invade, the U.S. is unwilling to compromise with Japan and will further exert economic pressure on Japan." This statement is not without reason.</p>
<p>Third, informal U.S.-Japan talks are still ongoing. The U.S., with the greatest patience, hopes to achieve a peaceful resolution of the differences between the U.S. and Japan. For the U.S., this is not out of fear of Japan, nor is it out of fear of war. What it seeks is to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and obtain a fair and peaceful solution. We should understand that the U.S., while engaging in negotiations with lofty goals, is also working hard on practical actions. This concretely explains its true intentions. If Japan abandons aggression, everything can be considered at length; otherwise, the only option is to strike force with force. The U.S. is making efforts to negotiate with Japan, and at the same time, it is also working hard to take action. The decision of the military mission to come to China cannot but be recognized as one of the important actions of the U.S.</p>
<p>Looking at the above, the arrival of the U.S. military mission to China is of great significance. As for the mission of this visit, according to news from Washington: 1. Consult with China and other authorities to study the military situation within China and its needs for military equipment; 2. Compile an itemized list of the types and quantities of materials needed; 3. Assist in the procurement of these needed materials domestically and their delivery to China; 4. Propose recommendations of an appropriate nature to ensure that assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act is as effective as possible, benefiting the efforts of the U.S., China, and the world to resist the movement of armed conquest.</p>
<p>A military mission with such an important mission and such broad powers will depart for China within half a month. We do not need to study how its duties will be executed or how the work will begin, but we can assert that in the future, Chinese strategy, with the contribution of opinions from friendly military experts, will certainly gain some new improvements, which will be beneficial to the future general counteroffensive. Regarding the training of mechanized units and the air force, with the guidance of experts, they will also display amazing combined power in the battlefield and in the sky with a brand-new posture. As for the timely arrival of new weapons, the increase in quantity, and how to defend the Yunnan-Burma Road to facilitate transportation, these are all issues that the mission and the Chinese authorities will study day and night, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>As Ambassador Hu Shi said, the Roosevelt-Churchill conference did not neglect China. We believe that this move by the United States is far-sighted and provides China with immense fundamental assistance and spiritual encouragement, and it also demonstrates to the world in fact the termination of the policy of appeasement towards Japan. We can also assert that the United States will definitely have more resolute and concrete facts to continuously demonstrate in the Far East, dealing a fatal blow to violence.</p>

<h3>Guo Taiqi Tells United Press Reporter That the U.S. Will Not Betray China. China Has Become an Active Participant in the World Diplomatic Scene. Makes Significant Contributions to the Development of the Current International Situation. The Pacific Problem Cannot Be Solved Without China's Cooperation.</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Dr. Guo Taiqi reiterated last night that he believes that the U.S. will not betray China in the current U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. Guo made the above statement specifically to the United Press to supplement his official communique to foreign reporters on Monday and because the Chinese people still feel uneasy about the U.S.-Japan talks. Foreign Minister Guo's original communique was a commentary on Churchill's radio address on Sunday. He said that China should not worry about being betrayed. He said that many foreigners, even some Chinese, ignore the fact that China is no longer merely the object of foreign foreign policies. After four years of fighting on the front lines and being the vanguard against aggression, China has become an active participant in the world diplomatic arena. China makes extremely important contributions to the development of the current international situation and is willing to contribute to post-war reconstruction. China is a partner, so a final solution cannot be obtained in the Pacific without China's agreement to cooperate. Finally, Guo laughed and said, "China does not want to be sacrificed."

<p>CCP Analyzes British and American Declaration</p>
<p>Chongqing - Xinhua Daily, Yan'an dispatch, the CCP issued a statement on the 19th on the joint declaration by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill and the upcoming Moscow Conference, stating that this declaration and conference show the determination of Britain and the U.S. to combat fascism, so it is completely beneficial to the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States, China, and the world. The U.S.'s expression of determination means that the anti-fascist aggression front has been politically completed, and the Moscow Conference will complete it organizationally. The Roosevelt-Churchill declaration did not mention Japan, and the fourth and seventh articles even hint at attempting to win over the status quo maintainers in Japan. However, the second, third, and eighth articles are actively anti-Japanese, so the entire Chinese people welcome the British and American declaration and welcome the upcoming British, American, and Soviet conference in Moscow. We believe that as long as the people of the entire country increase their efforts, the group can be consolidated, the policy can be adhered to, and the counterattack can be realized. China is qualified to participate in the world anti-fascist front and become a capable field army. The fate of the entire China and the entire humanity is related to this anti-fascist duel. The various parties in China should make good use of the rare opportunity to unite the people of the entire country and work together in a good and progressive direction. This is what we Communists deeply hope for. (27th dispatch by Havas)</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang and His Wife Fete Mrs. Devi</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Mrs. Kamala Devi, a representative of the Indian National Congress, has been traveling around the world for two years. She arrived in Chongqing from the U.S. four days ago, visited central figures, and was feted by Generalissimo Chiang and his wife. The New Life Movement Women's Guidance Association also invited her to a luncheon to report on the wartime work of Chinese women. Mrs. Devi is extremely interested in the situation of China's resistance and the activities of women and will write about her impressions after returning home. She is now scheduled to fly to Yangon to return to India the day after tomorrow. Chongqing is actually the last stop on her round-the-world trip. According to a reporter from the Shishi Xinbao, "I love Chongqing very much, purely because it is China's wartime capital. Although the climate here is relatively poor and air raids are frequent, it cannot affect this feeling in the slightest. The Indian people, regardless of men, women, old, and young, all deeply hope that China will win victory soon to lay the foundation for true peace in the Far East. In addition, Mrs. Devi, like other foreign travelers, praised Chongqing's natural air defense situation and well-equipped facilities, saying that London is truly beyond comparison."

<h3>Successful Advance of British and Indian Troops: Occupation of Important Iranian Oil Region; Four Northern Iranian Cities Under Soviet Control; Axis Vessels in the Persian Gulf Captured</h3>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Simla, 27th: Headquarters intelligence announced yesterday that British and Indian forces entered Iran from three directions on Monday morning. An Indian force landed in Abadan with the cooperation of naval and air forces, and captured two German vessels (destroyed) and three Italian vessels (slightly damaged) at Bardar Sharpur. Three other stranded German vessels and their crews were also captured. The intelligence further stated that British forces are attempting to protect British expatriate families working for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It also stated that British and Indian forces, including infantry and armored units, entered Iran simultaneously from Khrnikin and that the Naftishan oil region and Qasrishiran were occupied without resistance. The residents showed no hostility.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Simla, 27th: An official communiqué stated that the advance of British and Indian forces in southwestern Iran continues systematically. Indian forces have cleared Iranian troops near the oil stations in the Abadan area, capturing two cannons, three armored vehicles, and 350 soldiers. Malit, 40 miles north of Abadan, has also been occupied. Banda Shapur is tranquil. Qilan in the Qanaqin region has been occupied by Indian forces after bombardment. Another force is advancing towards the Patak Pass, having crossed Sla-pul. The British Air Force continues to assist the advancing forces and is distributing leaflets in various cities. In the air battles so far, at least six Iranian aircraft have been destroyed and several damaged. All British aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>It is reported that among the prisoners captured by the Allied forces in Banda Shapur are a large number of Germans and Italians. It is now known that the British airborne troops have landed in Haft Kel to protect the employees of the oil company. British forces have now completely occupied Banda Shapur, Khorramshahr, Shalaman, and Quisha Xia Ke, and all areas west of Khorramshahr to Abadan are now in British hands. On the south bank of the Karun River, British forces have occupied a naval dock and secured control of the waterway between Basra and Abadan. Iranian troops on Abadan Island have been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Simla, 27th: Military commentators state that the British forces' entry into Iran through the three locations of Khankin, Khorramshahr, and Abadan is most important through Khankin because that is an oil field that the British want to secure to prevent sabotage. Khorramshahr, at the mouth of the Khorram River, is the starting point of an important transportation route. Abadan is also important, housing one of the world's largest oil refineries and employing a large number of Indians. In addition, Banda Shapur, where British forces landed, is at the southern end of the Persian railway. The British government had strongly urged the Iranian authorities to take action against the German and Italian vessels remaining there, including oil tankers, hoping that Iran would order the German and Italian crews to leave the ships and send Iranian soldiers on board to prevent the ships from being scuttled.</p>
<p>TASS News Agency, Moscow, 27th: According to the Soviet-Iranian agreement, Soviet troops entering Iran have occupied Tabriz, Ardabil, Visha, and Dilman on the 26th. Soviet troops are continuing their advance according to plan.</p>
<p>Tabriz is the second-largest city in Iran and an important northern center, with a population of 220,000, located 60 miles south of the Soviet border. Ardabil has a population of 45,000 and is 25 miles from the Caspian Sea. Dilman is located between Lake Urmia and the Turkish border.</p>
<p>British Aircraft Cover Army Advance: Leaflets Distributed Over Iranian Capital</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, London, 27th: The British military headquarters in Cairo first published a British Air Force bulletin regarding the Iranian incident Sunday afternoon, stating that British Air Force medium bombers dropped leaflets over Tehran and other Iranian cities yesterday. British fighter planes protected the advancing British forces and destroyed three Hawk aircraft in Iranian airfields that were preparing to take off and attack British forces. British transport planes cooperated with the army in transporting troops and supplies.</p>
<p>International News Service, Simla, 27th: American-made giant transport planes, larger than those used by the Germans in the Battle of Crete, landed British soldiers near the Iranian oil region to protect the oil fields from destruction by retreating Iranian troops and to defend the lives of British families in the oil region. It is said that this move by the British is of strategic importance because it could teach Turkey a lesson about what kind of action Britain is prepared to take against those who support the Axis powers. Troops transferred from North Africa and Iraq, under the command of General Wavell, are consolidating their positions along the railway leading to the Iranian capital. These Indian troops have participated in battles in Iraq and North Africa.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 27th: According to a report by the "Ya Bao" correspondent in London, Asiya, London believes that the war against Iran will be conducted with lightning speed. British forces transferred from Egypt, Syria, and Abyssinia have concentrated on the Iranian border, and a large number of aircraft transported from the United States have also arrived at the front lines. The British forces attacking Iran number 500,000, while the Iranian army numbers only 200,000.</p>
<p>Iranian King Receives British and Soviet Envoys: Capital Residents Remain Calm as Usual</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, London, 27th: The Iranian King is now personally handling the Iranian situation, but its nature is currently unknown. According to responsible sources in London, the British and Soviet ambassadors to Iran notified the Iranian Foreign Minister at dawn on Monday of the British and Soviet governments' intention to take action against the German fifth column, and guaranteed that British and Soviet troops would withdraw as soon as their military presence in Iran was no longer necessary. The Iranian King then requested to meet with the British and Soviet ambassadors. The two ambassadors met with the Iranian King at 10:00 AM on Monday to conduct discussions. Reuter's News Agency, London, 27th: A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent stated that although there is no confirmation of rumors that the Iranian government may seek a peaceful resolution with Britain and the Soviet Union, there is no doubt that the Iranian King has recognized the formidable nature of the Allied forces' joint entry into Iran. It is generally believed that the Iranian government must now understand the legitimacy of the Allied action and the importance that the Allied nations place on Iran's position. It is reported that the British envoy to Iran will meet with the Iranian King again today.</p>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 27th: Tehran Radio reported yesterday that Prime Minister Mansur addressed the parliament on Monday evening, urging the Iranian people to remain calm. He stated that Soviet troops have begun attacks in Tabriz, Hasas, Ben Ham, Ramsha, and Shapur, while British troops are attacking in Memens Mansur. The Prime Minister urged the people to maintain order and stated that the cabinet will discuss all necessary measures to deal with the "aggression." The cabinet will notify the parliament after a decision is made.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tehran, 27th: On Tuesday, the second day of the British and Soviet invasion of Iran, the situation in Tehran was no different from usual. The people's attitude was calm and peaceful. According to an eyewitness account of the Soviet attack on the port of Pahlavi on the Caspian coast, a Soviet aircraft dropped eight 18-kilogram bombs on the 25th, but they all fell into the sea without causing any damage.</p>
<p>Iranian Fleet Suffers Heavy Losses: Naval Admiral Killed in Action</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Simla, 27th: The losses of the Iranian Navy include two small ships sunk, four gunboats captured, in addition to a supply ship, two tugboats, and a floating dock capable of accommodating 6,000-ton vessels. Iranian Naval Admiral Baunter was also killed in action while leading the counterattack. British ships suffered no losses. Seven of the eight German and Italian ships remaining in Banda Shapur have been captured, and one has been sunk. Of the seven captured, two are intact and five can be repaired. There were no British casualties. The Germans and Italians had made detailed plans to destroy all eight ships, but the British acted quickly to prevent total loss.</p>
<p>Basra Declared a War Zone: Turkish Troops Mobilized to Defend Border</p>
<p>Tonghai News Agency, Ankara, 27th: News from Baghdad reports that Basra, Iraq's important seaport, has now been declared a war zone. Basra is located 100 kilometers from the port of Banda Shapur, where British forces landed the previous morning.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 27th: The Mashakiro newspaper reports that Turkish troops have mobilized to defend the border facing the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>German Plot in Near East Foiled: Pressure May Be Applied to Turkey</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Bern, 27th: Reports in the Swiss newspapers regarding the Allied forces' entry into Iran indicate that Germany, unable to provide direct assistance to Iran, will compensate by applying pressure to Turkey. The Axis news agency Vichy reports that Turkey's attitude is now causing special concern. Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan signed the Sa'dabad Pact of non-aggression in Tehran in 1937. The Turkish government is greatly constrained by this pact, and Germany may use this pact to achieve its goals. The news agency also stated that we do not know what actions Germany intends to take, only to urge Ankara to remember the literal meaning of the treaty. According to news from several cities, the German military command has made some arrangements. According to a Berlin report in the Swiss newspaper, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated, "Germany believes that it is not related to the Iranian incident. Germany will take countermeasures when the time is right, but when to take these measures is the question because Berlin understands that the British have all possible strategic advantages in the Middle East, and Germany is not sure of the real possibility of providing military assistance to Iran at this time. Berlin now expects Iran to resist, although the resistance may not be long, it will give Germany the possibility to carry out strategic goals in the Black Sea and gain valuable time." A Berlin report in the "New Zurich Newspaper" also stated that Germany is now paying special attention to Turkey's attitude.</p>
<p>Afghanistan Resolves to Strictly Adhere to Neutrality: All Parties Express Sympathy to Britain and the Soviet Union</p>

<p>Reuter's News Agency, Quetta, British Baluchistan, 27th: The general tribal people on the Indian-Iranian border feel that the British and Soviet forces' entry into Iran indicates Britain's determination to prevent the war from spreading to the Middle East and the Islamic countries on the Indian border, and feel that if Britain had not taken the current action, the Axis powers may have occupied the entire Iran. The British declaration that they have no territorial ambitions in Iran has been welcomed by the tribal people.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Damascus, 27th: Political circles in Syria expressed the view that it was necessary for the Allied forces to take the initiative in Iran in order to consolidate the security of the Middle Eastern countries. Newspaper comments expressed sympathy for the actions of Britain and the Soviet Union and compared this action to the intervention in Syria, calling it the second stage of suppressing the Nazi conspiracy in the Middle East.</p>
<h3>A Journey in the Southwest Air (II): Hong Kong, Chongqing, Kunming, Lashio</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Lashio</p>
<p>A brief stop in Kunming to load and unload passengers and refuel. The sky was dim. Japanese planes had not flown over the city suburbs all day and would not come again now. An American radio engineer teaching at the aviation school here said that most of the Japanese pilots were still students in flight school.</p>
<p>After the last tank of gas was filled, we took off again. In weather worse than before, we flew over the highest mountains of the journey in darkness. No one worried about this bad weather, but later one frightened Chinese passenger actually slid from his seat into the aisle because of the severe shaking of the plane. The plane was at an altitude of 14,000 feet. You felt a little uneasy, the weather was cold, and both legs were numb. You stretched out your body, sat up straight, and wondered why it was like this. The DC-2 was like a ship rolling in big waves. The Chinese passengers, who were laughing and joking when they left Kunming, were now silent. What you could see now were countless large circles of fire in the mountains, where farmers had burned the trees to allow mountain floods to irrigate their fields. It was beautiful and unbelievable: in the darkness, suddenly seeing thousands of red lights, a spectacular sight. Then the plane banked and landed, and we all fastened ourselves to our seats. We didn't know it was the Lashio airport until we landed.</p>
<p>Coolies took the luggage to the airport office. The office was a bamboo hut lit by a kerosene lamp. Several mixed-race inspectors, sweating profusely, were busy looking at our passports. It was 10 p.m. We had been in the air for twelve hours, and the journey was longer than from Greensboro to St. Louis in the United States. We slept in bed and slept very well. There was a large bathtub for bathing, and the food was as good as expected. Tomorrow we will go out to observe the street scene. Lashio is an emerging city in the East, with the railway from Yangon ending here and the Burma Road to China starting here. What we saw was a lively and filthy market, several barracks, Western-style wooden houses, native women shyly scrubbing their bodies around public water pipes, and a jewelry store buying and selling not-so-precious gems. (According to the Indian shop owner, he does not keep the best gems because it is too dangerous.)</p>
<p>We returned to the airport, which was only half the size of a standard American battlefield. Outside the bamboo office, a neatly painted sign read: New York 12,923 miles, San Francisco 10,240 miles. I saw many Burmese men and women and oxen smoothing the red soil on the airport. A squadron of Australian destroyers was about to land here, and this place was reserved for them.</p>
<p>We sat in the sun waiting for the weather report. The report came. The weather was extremely good, but another twenty-seven Japanese planes were bombing Kunming, and we had to wait for the all-clear before departing. We would arrive in Kunming just as the Japanese planes left, and leave Kunming again at dawn before the Japanese planes came. If we took a car from Lashio to Kunming on the Burma Road, it would take at least a week if everything went smoothly. But by plane, it would take two hours and ten minutes with a tailwind. It was still early, and the Burmese were driving cattle to plow the fields, and the sun was hot.</p>
<p>Kunming Scenery</p>
<p>We have now flown to Kunming, and from the air, the bombed area looks very small. On the plane, you don't know what the houses look like when they are destroyed, what the sounds are; you don't know that people are buried alive under the houses, and you don't know that the people who lived in the houses before are now homeless. From above, it is very simple to see a bomb drop.</p>
<p>The plane has now landed, and we returned to the hotel. The bombed areas in the city were dim and lightless. We took rickshaws. The rickshaw pullers were gasping for breath and shouting, "Hui! Qiang!" and were too lazy to use their bells. You could smell the dust from the rubble and debris, and a wisp of black smoke rose from the burning houses, and more and more people gathered. The rickshaw pullers were now running slowly, the stones embedded in the streets were turned out of the road, and telephone and electric light lines were all over the street. A group of people stood in front of a large movie theater. The theater was showing the Technicolor film Kentucky, and the Chinese were quietly waiting in the dark, waiting for the power lines to be repaired before watching the movie.</p>
<p>If you want to run around in a place pierced by shrapnel, there is always the danger of being tripped. The narrow streets were full of Chinese people: men wearing black or faded clothes, several women with bound feet walking unsteadily in the street, farm women wrapped in braids hanging down their backs, wearing black clothes and pants, children were weaving back and forth in the crowds. They were all walking quietly and slowly. The water pipe manager had been hit by shrapnel, and the sewers and streets were all flooded with water. You could hear people moving, you could hear the sounds of hammers and shovels, digging into hard clods of earth or stone. People used candles or kerosene lamps to light the way and return to their bombed homes.</p>
<p>Kunming has a population of 500,000. When the air raid siren sounded, they didn't even have time to lock their doors and fled to the suburbs. There were no air defense facilities in the city, and the fragile houses had no protection; people fled to the mountains to watch the bombing of the empty city. There were also those who escaped a little, because they were too tired, or sick, or hated running long distances every day, but they were all bombed to death. Now it was getting late, and people were returning from the safe zones in the suburbs to see how badly their homes were damaged.</p>
<p>We stayed at the European Hotel, which was not bombed. We drank a little wine, which was considered luxurious and very interesting. I told Roy that it had been a whole day, but it was actually two days. Of course, that didn't mean anything to him. He had been flying in China for six years, he had been the personal pilot of the Young Marshal, and he had flown Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek out of the Xi'an Incident. He then became Chiang's personal pilot.</p>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Issues Statement, Sharply Rejects Japanese Protest, Warns Against Obstructing Soviet-American Trade, Otherwise Considered an Unfriendly Act</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 27th – On August 25th, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, presented a statement to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, stating that the United States is transporting oil, petroleum, and other materials purchased by the Soviet Union to Vladivostok. From the Japanese perspective, this action has caused a very delicate and difficult situation, as these goods are bound to pass close to Japanese territorial waters. In view of this, the Japanese government must request the Soviet government to pay serious attention to this issue and agree to consult on the route and method of this shipment. Molotov replied to Tatekawa that on August 23rd, the Japanese Foreign Minister had also made the same statement to the Soviet Ambassador to Japan. The Soviet government instructed the Soviet Ambassador to Japan to convey the following reply to the Japanese Foreign Minister: "The Soviet government believes that there is absolutely no reason for Japan to worry, as the oil and petroleum purchased by the Soviet Union from the United States, as you pointed out, are being transported to the Soviet Union via normal trade routes (including Soviet Far Eastern ports). Similarly, the Soviet government will never be deeply concerned about Japan's purchases from foreign countries. On this point, the Soviet government believes it must state that any attempt to hinder normal Soviet-American trade relations (via Soviet Far Eastern ports) will be regarded by the Soviet side as an unfriendly act. At the same time, the Soviet government confirms that the purpose of Soviet purchases from the United States is primarily to meet the increased needs of the western region after the Soviet Union was forced to engage in a war of self-defense, as well as the current economic needs of the Soviet Union in the Far East."</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 27th – Officials announced yesterday that the Soviet Union has warned Japan not to interfere with American ships sailing to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Japan Issues Protests to Both the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th – According to Japanese news agencies, the Japanese government has protested to both the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the transportation of American gasoline to the Soviet Union. The Japanese government has pointed out that the route to Vladivostok passes too close to Japan, and that American aid to the Soviet Union consists of high-grade gasoline. Newspapers tonight are all printing the Japanese move in large characters, saying that the government is watching the situation with the utmost concern and eagerly awaiting a written or active response. It is noteworthy that the newspapers do not use the word "protest," but rather call this action "negotiation" or "warning." Although the content of the Japanese negotiation has not been announced, according to the most right-wing Kokumin Shimbun, Foreign Minister Toyoda's adoption of this action is because the Japanese government, from the standpoint of maintaining peace in East Asia, cannot take a light view of this shipment. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan is faithfully adhering to its neutrality pact with the Soviet Union and will inevitably pay serious attention to the passage of the shipment near Japanese territory. Therefore, it has now taken diplomatic action, and at the same time, the government is also planning other appropriate measures. The Jiji Shimbun's headline stated that Japan has formally notified the relevant countries of its serious concerns. Miyako Shimbun stated that the gasoline that has already been shipped from American ports includes 2,700,000 gallons shipped from San Francisco on August 15th, 3,900,000 gallons from Los Angeles on August 16th, 3,792 barrels from San Francisco on the same day, and 7,800 barrels shipped from San Francisco by a Soviet ship on August 19th. Those currently being loaded or scheduled to depart include 4,300,000 gallons from San Francisco and 7,500 barrels from Los Angeles. According to Japanese sources, the American Embassy in Tokyo has not received any Japanese negotiations regarding the oil shipment. Embassy officials have said that negotiations are currently being conducted by Japanese representatives and State Department officials in Washington. American Embassy Counselor Dooman visited the Foreign Ministry this afternoon, but the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 27th – An Information Bureau spokesman confirmed today that Japan has protested to the United States and the Soviet Union about certain American goods being shipped to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. Domei News Agency stated that Japan pointed out in the protest that the nature of the aid goods being shipped to the Soviet Union and the supply route chosen are sufficient to cause unease. It also stated that since the Roosevelt-Churchill conference, Soviet and American ships transporting high-grade aviation fuel and other military supplies to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok have greatly stimulated Japanese sentiment, especially because aviation gasoline has recently been banned from being shipped to Japan, but it is now passing in front of Japan and being shipped to the Soviet Union, which makes the Japanese extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 27th – Washington officials are maintaining silence today regarding Japan's attitude toward the Pacific question. However, knowledgeable sources explain that the change in Japanese tone is clearly a cautious measure taken pending clarification of the Soviet-German war situation. These people do not believe that Japan is about to split with the Axis powers. Regarding the issue of American military supplies to the Soviet Union, many believe that the remarks of Japanese Information Department Acting Spokesman Ishii are a sign of a softening of Japan's Pacific policy.</p>

<h3>German Special Communiqué Claims Capture of Two Major Soviet Industrial Cities</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – Regarding the situation on the Eastern Front, the Soviets only stated that fierce fighting took place along the entire line yesterday. The German High Command issued a special communiqué from Hitler's headquarters, announcing that German troops had occupied Dnipropetrovsk, a major city on the west bank of the Dnieper River. The city is located in the center of the Dnieper River bend, has a population of over 500,000, and is an important industrial center in Ukraine. The German communiqué stated that the rapid advance units of General Kleist's mechanized corps had captured the bridgehead and, after fierce fighting, occupied the city of Dnipropetrovsk. The enemy had thus lost its last strong foothold on the west bank of the Dnieper River downstream from Kiev.

<p>Soviet Union Has Strong Manpower and Material Resources, Nazis Will Find It Difficult to Achieve Decisive Victory</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – A Reuters military commentator said that although there has been no decisive change in the Soviet front, the situation remains critical. The German offensive, after making great progress in several places, has been checked, but has not achieved its true purpose, namely, to destroy the Soviet army and occupy the three major Soviet cities. The Soviets rely not on their fortresses or natural obstacles, but on their soldiers and weapons. The Soviet soldiers have not lost their faith and determination and appear to have ample weapons and equipment. If this situation persists, the Germans will not be able to achieve a decisive victory. General Moloshenko's counterattack has been quite successful. Although the extent of the counterattack is not known, it is quite important, as the Soviet army has clearly not been destroyed or annihilated in terms of morale and manpower as the Germans have claimed. The German third decisive offensive against Leningrad, Odessa, and the Dnieper River line, although not completely blocked, has gradually slowed down. The German supply problem must now be extremely difficult. In addition, there are manpower and material problems. It is doubtful whether the Germans can still maintain the confidence of their soldiers and the effectiveness of their mechanized vehicles. Once German confidence wanes and the mechanized corps lose their necessary effectiveness, the German army will inevitably collapse. At the same time, the entry of British and Soviet troops into Iran has greatly enhanced the Soviet position and the overall situation in the Middle East. A strong British-Soviet joint front has been established to prevent German advances eastward.</p>

<h3>Public Funds in Argentina Diverted by German Embassy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Argentinian Capital, 27th – Part of the public funds donated to local charities and cultural undertakings in Argentina appears to have been diverted by the German Embassy. The authorities have asked the Minister of Justice to inform the Supreme Court, which can try diplomatic cases, of the procedures that should be taken against the German Embassy. Also, the head of German intelligence in Argentina, Sandschieder, was scheduled to appear in court for questioning yesterday, but he fled by plane a few hours before the trial of the reactionary conspiracy case began. The authorities have notified the Brazilian Foreign Minister by telephone, as it is expected that Sandschieder will arrive in the Brazilian capital tonight.</p>

<h3>A Portrait of Three Key Figures in the British Cabinet</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the top priority of the British Ministry of Aircraft Production is collecting aluminum. At the time, there were rumors of a shortage of aluminum in Britain. The reason for the shortage was a secret within the ministry, but the reaction in Lord Beaverbrook's mind was swift and simple. He said, "If there is indeed a shortage, I will correct this situation." After he made an appeal in the most moving manner, millions of housewives across the country immediately collected all kinds of aluminum utensils from their homes and placed them on nearby garbage piles, expressing their devotion. While their public-spiritedness and generosity were appreciated, Lord Beaverbrook did more than that. He had presented the country's most urgent need to the people. As a result, the ministry he headed was often on people's lips, and aircraft workers were brought to the forefront of public attention. This decisive appeal for aluminum must be attributed to his early training at the Daily Express.</p>
<p>Secondly, because Lord Beaverbrook was familiar with the inner workings of the Canadian and American financial circles, he was able to get the help of many powerful people. He wanted American planes, and he was able to get American planes, with the quantity increasing month by month. But he did not express excessive optimism. Worry, hardship, and hard work were all things he valued greatly.</p>
<p>When he was tired of playing the roles of "robber baron" and "preaching pastor," Lord Beaverbrook often liked to play the role of a pessimistic naysayer. Playing such a role gave him the opportunity to have a great impact. However, after shaking his head slightly, he announced the recent quantity of aircraft production in Britain, and then he grinned. This is Lord Beaverbrook's biggest secret. The numbers on his desk every day are enough to represent a rare race in the history of world industry.</p>
<p>An American journalist asked, "What does 'Maxes' stand for?"</p>
<p>A Briton who had worked with Lord Beaverbrook on Fleet Street replied, "It stands for the highest quantity."</p>
<p>The American journalist said "Thank you" and wrote it down. In fact, the word "Maxes" is an abbreviation of "Maxwell" and doesn't stand for anything.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the other two key figures in the British Cabinet.</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Churchill is at Number 10 Downing Street, if a careless German pilot dropped a bomb, most Britons believe that their next Prime Minister, after a thousand tries, would be either the fifty-six-year-old Minister of Labour, Bevin, or the fifty-two-year-old Minister of Home Security, Morrison.</p>
<p>Bevin is short and stout, with a stern appearance, and is currently the Minister of Labour. He looks like</p>
<p>Lord Beaverbrook's son and daughter-in-law, a bull. In fact, he also possesses many bovine qualities. He can quickly see through the tricks of the bullfighter in a bullfight, and understand the whole situation in a few seconds. If he is spared death, he will never be led into the ring again. Bevin is a cunning strategist. He has the courage of a bull. In a noisy meeting, he will shrug his broad shoulders, stick out his thick neck, lower his head, and his eyes will shine through his glasses, to compete with others in wit and strength. People say that Bevin's opposition to communism is faster than any bull's reaction to red.</p>
<p>As for the Minister of Home Security, Morrison, he is like a chirping little bird, with a smile on his face at all times. He is not willing to let go of those who are mediocre in their work, like a sparrow grabbing breadcrumbs. He often raises his head and stretches his neck like a rooster, looking down on everything. His pride makes him a debater rather than a speaker. He has a great capacity for work. He sits at his desk, sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, hair standing on end. But his mind is orderly, without the slightest confusion, like a numbered and arranged file cabinet, where any event, large or small, can be found immediately.</p>
<p>They are two of the seven Labour leaders who joined Churchill's cabinet in May 1940. At that time, the Conservative Party still held a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons. According to convention, Britain should have formed a Conservative cabinet. It was a strange thing that they joined, but "adhering to principles is more important than calculating the number of seats in the House of Commons," which proves this point.</p>
<p>They knew that this war was a war of the whole people, not just a war of cabinet members and the army, so the government must represent the entire people, not just one party or faction. If workers are to be asked to sacrifice for democracy, they must first be convinced that they are part of democracy. Britain must engage in total war, and only by implementing total politics can this be achieved. British workers have always been anti-fascists during these many years of compromise. They know what the German workers have suffered, and they recognize that the Spanish Civil War was only the beginning of this decisive war, so they are extremely willing to fight fascism, but they must take full responsibility and stand behind those they believe in.</p>
<p>The Chamberlain government had lost the trust of the whole country. The Conservative Party knew that its prestige was completely lost and unsatisfactory, and wanted to fight effectively, so it had to invite the Labour Party to join the government and share responsibility. Churchill's recruitment of Labour members into the cabinet was not solely based on talent, but because they could represent an important part of the national population. They could gain the trust of the workers, so they occupied a strong position in politics. If they lost this trust, then Bevin and Morrison would only be two capable staff members.</p>
<p>Bevin has never been what ordinary people call a politician. Before he became Minister of Labour, most Britons did not know his name, but because he was the leader of the trade union movement, he has been one of the most powerful figures in Britain for the past twenty years. He has always disliked politicians, and since MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas betrayed the Labour movement in 1931, he has scorned them even more.

<h3>Finance: Every Hard Coin is Remarkably Expensive Because of the Collection and Lack of Small Change</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association, in the past, in order to regulate finance, submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins. They circulated for a while on the market, but now they have disappeared again. It is said that someone is buying them at a high price, and each yuan can increase in value by thirty or forty cents. In the past, the five-cent aluminum coins were supplied to various industries by the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry as much as possible. Recently, because it was heard that there was a premium for buying them on the market, plus the demand for exchanges was too crowded, since last week, only member banks and firms are allowed to exchange them. It is rumored that the purchase and exchange of aluminum coins is a planned action, with the intention of creating a shortage of one-cent and five-cent coins in order to profit from it. (Shou)</p>
<p>Not only aluminum coins, but also one-cent and five-cent banknotes are not as widely circulated as before, and if they exist, they are so tattered that they are unusable. Because the current printing cost of one-cent and five-cent coins and notes is actually more than these amounts, they will inevitably not be reprinted in the future, but their use has gradually narrowed. One-cent coins are still occasionally needed on streetcars, but their use in other markets is almost negligible. Five-cent coins are slightly more widely used than one-cent coins, but due to the soaring prices in the past month, there are not many things that five cents can buy. Previously, there were still large pancakes, oil-fried snacks, dried tofu, and dried radishes, but now all these things start at a minimum of one dime, so the use of five cents is only useful for transactions of one dime or more.</p>
<p>Nickel coins are even more incredible. Twenty five-cent nickel coins can be exchanged for more than ten yuan in legal tender, ten ten-cent nickel coins can be exchanged for nine yuan, and ten twenty-cent nickel coins can be exchanged for about seventeen yuan.</p>
<p>The Financial Network of Gansu</p>
<p>—Gradually Completed, Interest Rates Falling—</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai financial industry, before last year, various counties in Gansu Province had established a total of fifty-six branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank, the Gansu Provincial Bank, the Shaanxi Provincial Bank, and the Suiyuan Provincial Bank. This year, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank, and the Gansu Provincial Bank have added thirty-six branches, totaling ninety-two branches, distributed in sixty-four of the province's sixty-six counties. The four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, now have a total of twenty branches in the province, located in Lanzhou, Tianshui, Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou, Pingliang, and other places. Among them, the Central Bank is more active. Before the establishment of the Central Bank's branch, the exchange rate for remittances from Gansu to Shanghai was eight hundred yuan per thousand yuan. It has now dropped to ten yuan, and the market interest rate has dropped from four percent to one percent. (Shou)</p>
<h3>Food: 35,000 Bags of Tribute Rice</h3>
<p>Arrived in Port Yesterday Morning, Large Quantities of Bean Cake Shipped South</p>
<p>More tribute rice has arrived in port. The French company's Kai Ding Hao vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 35,000 bags of foreign rice directly from Saigon, docking at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou to unload.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains and foreign rice were all suspended from the market yesterday, but today (the 28th), a considerable amount of bean cake is being exported to Southeast Asia, including 1,796 bags of soybeans shipped to Singapore, 1,240 pieces of bean cake shipped to Xiamen, 500 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 620 pieces shipped to Singapore, 1,780 pieces shipped to Siam, and 450 bags of sorghum shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Take a Look at Last Month's Cotton Prices, All Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>The cotton market in July: the situation in the first ten days was mediocre. After the middle ten days, due to the rise of foreign cotton and the tense situation in the Far East, there were concerns about obstacles to the source of foreign cotton. The inventory in Shanghai was not abundant, and factories and flower shops were actively purchasing, and market prices rose daily. By the end of the month, each type of cotton had risen by twenty-five to forty yuan compared to the beginning of the month. 196,520 dan were traded, an increase of 66,550 dan compared to the previous month. American cotton rose by 142 to 158 pounds/sound, and Indian cotton rose by 1/2 to 12 1/2 rupees up and down. A list of the prices of each type of cotton is recorded on the left (based on Sima weight).</p>
<h3>American Cotton is Infested with Pests, Prices Surge by Ten Pounds/Sound, Yarn and Cloth are Shipped South in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market: first, prices rose due to reports of insect pests affecting cotton production and harvests, and then due to purchases by peers and Wall Street, the market surged. As a result, closing prices rose by thirty-five to forty-three pounds/sound compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was closed for one day. It is predicted that the market will open today and prices will rise by about four rupees due to the high prices of American cotton.</p>
<p>Today, 1,150 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 195 pieces were shipped to Siam, and 24 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 965 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 70 pieces were shipped to Singapore, 19 pieces were shipped to Lou Lang, and 155 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Inside Story of the Drastic Increase in Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War in 1939, Jardine Matheson's Paisley woolen fabrics, which averaged only four yuan per yard in 1938, sold for five yuan after the outbreak of the European War in 1939. After the drastic change in foreign exchange on May 2, 1940, the price immediately rose to twelve yuan per yard. Since the British government controlled the transport of wool to China and the US dollar was frozen this year, the price has jumped from twenty yuan to twenty-five yuan. It can also be seen that the force of the drastic increase in the current year and the previous two years is strong. Other spring, summer, autumn, and winter woolen fabrics for men and women in various thicknesses and colors, seventy to eighty percent of them, have price increases equal to those of Paisley. The main reasons for the price increases are mostly attributed to the lack of goods, limited production by local factories, and the reduction of foreign exchange, etc. However, it is not known that (1) the isolated island economy is now abnormally developed, it is easy to make money, and it is also easy to spend money. Western-style and Chinese-style woolen fabrics for men and women in various colors are still selling briskly, and most of the customers who come to the door are more generous than before the incident. This is because they are all aware of the high prices of goods now. (2) Speculators have recently occupied an important position, taking advantage of the situation and speculating with each other, like tigers with wings. There were more of them last year than the year before, and even more this year than last year. (According to the current classification of speculators): (A) Large wholesalers and trading companies use manipulative means to monopolize and hoard goods. (B) Shops selling new and used clothing for men and women follow the lead of large wholesalers and collect as much as possible in advance. (C) Outsiders and semi-insiders or people in the industry collude to hoard goods in bulk. (D) Customers who actually wear the clothes, in view of the fact that prices are increasing once they buy, and there is no end to the increase, those who can afford it conveniently purchase and store them in large quantities. Moreover, it has been proven that the earlier they buy and make the clothes, the cheaper it is, so more and more people buy and store them. Although it is said to be retail, the total amount is considerable. For many reasons like these, how can the price of woolen fabrics not increase drastically? (Qi)</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds are Expensive</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds are in short supply due to the poor harvest of new goods, and the number of arrivals is very small. In addition, the production price is increasing, so the market situation is very firm. Yesterday, the price for large-sized goods opened at 280 yuan, and it is said that there was only a small profit when calculated based on the ground price.</p>
<h3>Economic Talk</h3>
<p>—By Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Drawing Lines</p>
<p>Drawing lines has been gradually adopted by the industrial and commercial sectors in recent years, and was first used by statistical workers. The importance attached to statistics is a major achievement since the establishment of the National Government, and also a success advocated by newspapers and scholars before the National Government. Since 1927, the internal and external agencies under the National Government have had annual work reports, often using statistical figures and charts to show their achievements; in offices and reception rooms, statistical charts are often used as decorations; when Hu Hanmin was the head of the Legislative Yuan, he also compiled and printed a statistical monthly report, selecting materials that were quite refined and rigorous, because it was edited by Liu Jitao, and later edited and published by the Statistical Office. Various schools followed suit, and the walls were covered with patterns, all of which were statistics. Once this trend started, large companies and shops were also influenced by what they saw and heard, and thought that they should have some decorations. In the managers' offices, personnel departments, and business reports, there were many statistical charts with various patterns. Although there was still a lack of true understanding of statistics, imitating the example also achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that more than twenty years ago, even a crude and simple statistical chart was rare in Chinese publications. Since the publication of the Shang Bao (Commercial News), commercial and financial statistical charts have been published in commercial and financial news, and the trend was opened up at once. Newspapers and magazines followed suit, and gradually became a habit. Therefore, today's statistical knowledge of charts is far more profound and extensive than before; however, when one thinks back to the simple work at the beginning, the difficulty was no less than it is today, because there was nothing to learn from, and there was no way to discuss it. Everything was only learned from books (at that time, it was impossible to obtain statistical drawings), tracing their shapes, comparing them, imitating them, and waiting for gradual improvement. When drawing, drawing paper was not available, and everything had to be done by hand. If one was not careful and there was a slight ink stain, all the work would be ruined. Since there was no background in drawing and the equipment was simple, it was difficult to achieve perfection. Compared with today's complete tools, convenient use, and people with specialized knowledge, the difficulty cannot be measured.</p>
<p>The application of drawing lines to statistical work on the rise and fall of market prices was only done by Yu Baocheng (Yu Shao) twenty years ago. Yu was a scholar who engaged in business. At that time, the exchanges had just opened, and the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange was extremely influential. The opening of various exchanges also flourished, and the trading of yarn, flowers, margins, and securities suddenly became prosperous. Yu liked to make notes (a margin of ten taels was one note, so trading was called notes. "Zuo she" was a substitute name for trading, using "zuo jiaoyi" for trading, so "zuo" was used to represent trading). Every day, he carried out his drawing line work on the rise and fall of market prices to observe the trend of the market. At that time, the exchange brokers, the agents who reached out their hands in the market, and the apprentices who copied market accounts in small paper notebooks with small pencils (and now there are probably many who are prominent speculators in the market) saw dots and dashes on lined paper, and did not know what was going on, and were even more at a loss as to why. They only saw a line, twisting, rising and falling, sometimes like a strange peak rising, sometimes like a valley falling, so they compared it to drawing talismans in the market, and some thought it was a waste of energy and not very useful. In addition, there were also many Japanese merchants who carried out their drawing line work in the market, but they were not often seen. Unexpectedly, after years of effort, some people realized that drawing lines was convenient for observation, so they secretly imitated it and tried it, and it turned out to be useful. So they spread the word to each other, and those who were good at using their minds used drawing line work to study trends. Recently, there have even been specialized books on drawing lines published, and it is seen that drawing line work is becoming more and more common. I can't help but look back on the past, and I am secretly pleased that the business methods of the industrial and commercial sectors have made a lot of progress in the past twenty years.</p>
<p>Although the old Chinese industrial and commercial sectors did not have drawing line work to compare and study the trend of market prices, they had their own experiences and were quite able to make accurate assessments. What they valued most was the "guan kou" (barrier), which had great similarities and differences with drawing lines for observation. What is "guan kou?" It gradually evolved from colloquial language to be used in trading, and has almost become a commercial term. The "guan kou" is used to isolate the inside and outside, investigate traitors, levy market taxes, and travelers must pass through it, so there are various names such as entering the "guan," leaving the "guan," and checking the "guan." In children's games, theatrical performances, and oral recitations, there are also "holding the guan kou," "escaping from Tongguan," "Wenzhao Guan,"... countless types of "guan." In the business world, the predicted market price and the number that is desired to be reached in the future is called the "guan." For example, if a certain commodity is hovering around 155 yuan, then 160 yuan is assumed to be the "guan kou." If it breaks through the "guan," the market price may rise further. Conversely, if it hovers and falls, even falling to 150 yuan, it is also considered to have fallen into the "guan," and there may be a tendency to fall further. However, what is called the "guan" is not fixed, generally speaking, whole numbers are used as "guan" for fractional numbers, and large numbers are used as "guan" for small numbers, depending on what the merchant assumes!</p>
<h3>Sugar Beet</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The Latin name for sugar beet is Beta Vulgaris. In our country, it is also called sweet beet, beet greens, or sugar radish. I think that only the name "sugar beet" can perfectly express its characteristics, so I used it as the title. It is a vegetable plant of the Chenopodiaceae family, originally from the southern Mediterranean coast. There are more than ten species in the wild, and in gardens, only it and another of its siblings are planted, which does not produce tubers, but its stems and leaves can be used for salads. Now, let me briefly describe its morphology.</p>
<p>The leaves of the sugar beet are oval with deep serrations on the edges, thick in texture, and have petioles. In the summer, it grows a stem of about one meter in length, which branches out. In the leaf axils or at the tips, it blooms numerous small, yellow-green, five-petaled flowers, forming long spike-like inflorescences. The flower has five stamens and one pistil. After flowering, it bears fruit, which is wrapped in the original calyx. However, what people should pay most attention to is, of course, its underground fleshy tuber, which is spindle-shaped. This tuber, similar to a radish but containing sugar, comes in red, yellow, white, and light red colors, each with a different sugar content. Generally speaking, the section of the tuber exposed above the ground is rich in gaseous substances and contains no sugar, while the part hidden underground contains sugar.</p>
<p>There is now a difficult biological question to solve: those wild species of the same species as sugar beet, or even the kind mentioned earlier that is planted in gardens, Beta Vulgaris, all have very fine and weak roots. How is it that only the sugar beet's roots know how to store nutrients and can grow to such a swollen and plump extent? – The difference between carrots and wild roots is similar to this. -- According to the opinion of the French natural scientist Cortiere: this cannot be attributed solely to "human cultivation," because the other species has also been cultivated by humans for many centuries, but its roots have not developed and expanded. So, what should it be attributed to? First, the roots of wild plants originally have this tendency to thicken and enlarge; second, they accidentally and occasionally undergo cross-fertilization—hybridization—and thus continue to preserve this advantage. Using the terminology of evolution, this is entirely the result of "natural selection." This matter, according to recent scientists' practical experiments from the perspective of "eugenics," has been fully proven: for example, its sugar content can also be increased from the original four percent to as much as eighteen or twenty percent through eugenic methods! Isn't this a very clear annotation?</p>
<p>This valuable plant, the sugar beet, was initially buried among the thickets, unappreciated and unnoticed by people, and was at most used as fodder for cattle and sheep. It was probably the Germans who first ate it as a fresh vegetable, or chopped it into small pieces and cooked it with diced chicken. Indeed, its sweet taste and reddish-brown color are still a favorite food of most Europeans, especially the people of Germany and Russia. According to French records, it was introduced to France from Italy in the 16th century AD. Olivier de Serres, a man of that time, described it as follows: "There is something similar to parsnip called sugar beet, which has been recently introduced from Italy. It is a rather large tuber, with long, round leaves, and everything can be cooked and eaten. Its roots are reddish-brown, and when mixed with tender meat, the cooked juice is as red as vermilion, which is very beautiful and spectacular."</p>
<p>For many centuries, the privilege of sugar production was monopolized by sugarcane. – Not to mention the maltose made from rice and wheat malt in our country. – Indeed, what plant would dare to presume to compete with its majestic and unshakable golden throne? But this unassuming sugar beet wants to compete with it! It turned out that in the 18th century, there was a famous German chemist named Marggraff (1709-1782), who was deeply accomplished in his studies and was elected as a member of the Berlin National Academy of Sciences at the age of twenty-nine. In 1747 AD, he published his results of making pure sugar from sugar beets, which was simply to soak dried sugar beet slices in alcohol and then find a way to extract its sugar. He also proved that the white-angled sugar beet, which they called the "Silesian variety," was the richest in sugar content, accounting for seven percent of its own weight. He also predicted the hope that people would be able to extract pure sugar from plants other than sugarcane in the future.</p>
<p>Although Marggraff's academic experiments were successful, this work, which was twice as difficult with half the results, was still far from the road of industrial application. Fortunately, his disciple Achard (1753-1821) continued his aspirations and worked hard to research it. He was also a famous chemist and natural scientist, and the director of the Physics Department of the Berlin National Academy of Sciences. In 1786 AD, he received a piece of agricultural experimental land from the King of Prussia – near Berlin – and planted sugar beets extensively for experiments. He was the first to establish the first sugar beet sugar factory in Silesia in 1802 AD, and improved his teacher Marggraff's sugar making method and realized his ideal. Indeed, the glory of truly succeeding in making sugar from sugar beets should be attributed to him.</p>
<p>Don't forget that the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries was the period of the French Revolution and the subsequent rampages of Napoleon I in Europe. The cane sugar eaten by the French was previously entirely supplied by its island dependencies in the West Indies, such as Haiti. – At that time, Haiti was the leader in the world's sugar producing area and ranked first. – But France had already gone to war with Britain in the early days of its revolution. Britain, relying on its vast fleet and maritime hegemony, cut off France's transportation to its colonies, and the supply of cane sugar naturally became a serious problem. France also believed that the sugarcane from its own colonies could not be transported, and that everything that could be imported was operated by the enemy, the British, whom it hated for centuries, so it imposed extremely heavy taxes on sugarcane as a means of retaliation: for example, it initially taxed 100 francs for every 100 kilograms of sugarcane, and finally increased it to 50 percent of the value of sugarcane! The higher the tax, the more rampant the smuggling became, and the customs later gained nothing. However, the situation of insufficient supply, great shortage, and expensiveness of sugarcane can be imagined. When Napoleon I came to power, the competition with Britain intensified. He, like Hitler today, wished he could wipe out the British Isles in one fell swoop. But in 1805 AD, in the Battle of Trafalgar Bay in southern Spain, his navy was completely defeated by the British General Nelson, and the plan to directly conquer Britain became a bubble. He had no choice but to announce the "Continental Blockade Policy" in 1806 AD, prohibiting the sale of all British goods on the European continent, and wanted to use economic warfare to trap Britain: as a result, sugarcane, a valuable food that occupied such an important position in people's daily life, almost disappeared from the markets of Europe!</p>
<p>Sugar, although not as important as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, so that people "live when they get it and die when they don't," had already become one of the first things to do when opening the door in 19th-century Europe, an indispensable necessity for life. Now, due to the continental blockade, it has completely disappeared. You can imagine how much suffering the people of Europe felt. Even Napoleon I, the demon king who shook the whole of Europe, also felt the importance of exporting sugarcane and wanted to find a way to make up for this deficiency. As a result, the "Association for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry" was established in Paris, and rewards were offered for substitutes for sugarcane. To be honest, with such powerful advocacy and encouragement, the sugar beet sugar industry was able to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat and embark on the road of practicality. Otherwise, it is not known whether it would have remained dormant forever!</p>
<p>France had already obtained the so-called Silesian variety of sugar beet in the second half of the 18th century. In 1799 AD, the news that the Prussian Achard had extracted pure sugar from sugar beets also spread throughout the academic and business circles in France: but even in the highest institution in France, the so-called "National Academy of Sciences," there were many people who refused to believe it and scoffed at it! Now? Forced by the times, many people have to bury their heads and continue Achard's work. In 1810 AD, a pharmacist named Deyeux presented two pieces of sugar made from sugar beets to Napoleon; another person named Derosne presented his invented machine and sugar to the Paris Association for the Encouragement of Industry, but at this time, the sugar yield of sugar beets was only 4% of the raw materials. Then, Delessert (1773-1847), a banker with great activity, built the first sugar beet sugar factory in Passy Town near Paris; soon after, he independently established a total of twenty-one! Therefore, in 1812 AD, there were already 40 such sugar factories in the whole of France. In order to encourage people to participate in this cause, Napoleon I personally visited Delessert's sugar factory in Passy Town. He also listened to the advice of his Prime Minister and famous chemist Chaptal, and in front of the stunned workers, he personally took off the cross badge he was wearing on his chest, and then personally pinned it on Delessert's chest, and exempted all the sugar produced by the sugar factory from taxes for five years as a reward! According to Chaptal's statistics, this sugar factory, because it had no competitors, spent a total of 25,000 francs, squeezed 500,000 kilograms of sugar beets, and earned a profit of 25%.</p>
<p>In 1814 and 1815 AD, Napoleon I failed, and cane sugar from French colonies and foreign countries poured into France like a tide, so that the proportion of import tariffs fell from 330 to 44. The emerging sugar beet sugar industry, of course, could not withstand this ruthless blow, and suddenly fell sharply. However, although this blow was significant, it was not fatal, and it did not put the sugar beet sugar industry to death. On the contrary, this industry, taking advantage of Napoleon I's exemption of only five years of taxes, and the restored French government's lack of attention, continued to enjoy this privilege: so to be honest, its silent growth and prosperity in the dark never stopped for a day. People estimated that in 1825 AD, France already had a hundred of these sugar factories; the sugar production in 1829 AD was only equal to one-sixteenth of the country's consumption; soon, in 1835 AD, it produced 4.9 million kilograms of sugar annually, while the national consumption was only 5.9 million kilograms!</p>
<p>Since the sugar beet sugar industry was booming, the sugarcane planters and maritime transportation industry overseas regarded it as a great threat, and they worked together to attack the government; as a result, the sugar beet sugar industry was also subject to ruthless taxes; even a certain French cabinet was under pressure from the British government, and almost banned the production of this local sugar in mainland France under the slogan of "good neighborliness"! In any case, under numerous restrictions and difficulties, the French sugar beet sugar industry was still able to make rapid progress, so that by 1875 AD, its sugar production had risen to 450,000 tons, making it the leader among all European countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, since 1850 AD, a French scientist named Louis de Vilmorin, ahead of his time, already knew how to improve sugar beet seeds using artificial selection methods before the Austrian geneticist Mendel, and created many excellent varieties. Moreover, the invention of the "sugar meter" was also of great help to chemists. Therefore, in 1861, Louis de Vllmoriu even obtained a kind of sugar beet with a sugar yield of 16%, which was more than double that of the best variety in Prussia. What is even more icing on the cake is that an American named Rillieux invented a sugar making machine that can save countless energy, which has also been a great help to the sugar beet sugar industry.</p>
<p>It is most regrettable that this sugar industry in France, after reaching its peak in 1875 AD, immediately declined, falling from first place to fourth place: the reason is that the excellent sugar beet seeds with rich sugar content obtained by Louis de Vilmorin through artificial means were not valued by France, and no one cultivated them; moreover, the unreasonable taxation system was a major obstacle, because French taxation was calculated based on the amount of sugar produced, regardless of the raw materials used; as for other countries such as Germany, Russia, and Austria, they immediately cultivated Louis de Vilmorin's improved sugar beet seeds when they heard about them; and their taxation system was calculated based on the sugar beet residue after squeezing, so that sugar industrialists considered it a great benefit to produce more sugar and leave less residue, and invisibly increased the sugar yield. Moreover, if the sugar yield exceeded a certain limit, the state would also provide special subsidies. This wise measure soon doubled their sugar yield! If France had not caught up quickly and adopted foreign methods in everything in 1884, it would probably not only have been unable to maintain its fourth place in the sugar industry, but would have gone completely bankrupt.</p>
<p>To sum up: before the First European War, the sugar production of sugar beet sugar in European countries had all reached the level of 18%. Germany produced the most, reaching 2.7 million tons annually, followed by Russia, with 2 million tons annually; Austria was third, with 1.375 million tons annually; France was fourth, with 960,000 tons annually. Recently, Nazi Germany has always held the glorious first place: but now, I am afraid that it has already transformed this sugar factory, which can create benefits for the people, into a place for manufacturing airplanes, cannons, and all kinds of tools for slaughtering mankind.</p>

<h3>Iron Netting Erected Around the Concessions; Many Bridges Subjected to Interception and Secret Searches; Japanese Deny Intention to Blockade Concessions; Chinese Banned from Approaching Hongkou and Yangshupu Areas at Night</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, a spokesperson for the Japanese Army, stated yesterday in a meeting with reporters that the purpose of deploying barbed wire around the two concessions is to prevent terrorists from infiltrating the defense zone, and denied rumors that the Japanese Army intends to blockade the Public Concession or the French Concession. It is reported that the Japanese Army will install barbed wire at various locations, including parts of the Chinese areas and western Shanghai. Some alleys and small lanes will be closed, but main thoroughfares will remain open. Furthermore, according to Major Hasam, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, all bridges in Yangshupu, except for two main bridges, have been closed. It is claimed that this measure is also intended to prevent terrorists. The exact time when the bridges will be reopened is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Food and Groceries Intercepted</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that this morning (the 27th), the Japanese authorities began implementing their planned restrictions at Hongqiao, intercepting Chinese coolies carrying food and groceries intended for foreigners in the Hongqiao area. However, Japanese military authorities responded to inquiries about this matter, stating that it may be due to a misunderstanding, as the Japanese side has not imposed restrictions on foreigners. At the same time,</p>
<p>Foreign Cars Not Allowed to Cross Bridges</p>
<p>The Japanese side continued to adopt measures to prevent terrorist activities in the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts, so Chinese people passing through bridges were subjected to strict searches, and their packages and vehicles were inspected. Foreign cars were also searched. Some people traveling south across the Waibaidu Bridge from Hongkou were stopped by Japanese sentries and prevented from crossing the bridge. A Chinese child carrying a package of lace wanting to leave Hongkou was also stopped and forced to return.</p>
<p>Buses Suspended, Traffic Difficult</p>
<p>To facilitate the search of Chinese people on the bridges of Hongkou, Japanese buses have been suspended on Broadway Road since yesterday (the 26th), causing great inconvenience to many foreigners and Japanese who wanted to take Japanese buses from the Waibaidu Bridge station. This morning, the traffic on the bridges was extremely congested, even more so than in the previous few days.</p>
<p>Bridges Blocked, Open and Closed Intermittently</p>
<p>According to reports, on Monday night, after two Japanese were stabbed on Seward Road, the Japanese immediately blocked all bridges, and Chinese and foreign citizens were not allowed to pass. As a result, some foreigners were stranded in cars on the Waibaidu Bridge waiting for dawn. Yesterday, the bridges were opened and closed intermittently. A foreign doctor wanting to go to the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road was delayed until noon before being able to cross the bridge to the hospital. Currently, Japanese soldiers on the Yangshupu Road Bridge, Pingliang Road Bridge, and Ward Road Bridge have also intensified their search operations.</p>
<p>Night Closure, Effectively Martial Law</p>
<p>Furthermore, The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese side has implemented new regulations to prevent terrorist activities starting last night, stipulating that Chinese people are prohibited from entering or leaving Hongkou and Yangshupu every night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM. This indefinite nightly closure of the bridges over the Suzhou Creek is effectively martial law.</p>
<p>Terrorists Prevented from Infiltrating</p>
<p>However, according to sources from the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, this law does not apply to Japanese and foreigners, nor does it restrict Chinese people from entering or leaving Hongkou during the day. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, a spokesperson for the Japanese Army, stated at a press conference yesterday that the Japanese Army is currently intensifying efforts to prevent terrorists from infiltrating Shanghai from other areas and is erecting barbed wire around the two concessions, cutting off small lanes and narrow alleys, but main roads remain open.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Searches Conducted in the Northern Districts</p>
<p>In addition, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy stated that the Japanese Naval Landing Forces are cooperating with the Army to conduct large-scale searches in the northern districts, and to be more effective, all bridges on the Yangshupu Creek, except for two, have been closed. However, both spokespersons firmly denied rumors that the Japanese side's actions were a blockade of the concessions. The Navy spokesperson also said that he could not say how long this preventive measure would last. Foreigners will not be treated the same as Chinese during searches.</p>
<p>Increased Vigilance in the Nanshi Area</p>
<p>In recent days, the situation in the Nanshi area has suddenly become alarming. At all traffic points, iron gates have been reinforced, and Japanese military police and armed police have been dispatched to inspect and guard. Starting yesterday afternoon, Japanese Army and military police, riding in military trucks equipped with two machine guns and accompanied by two small tanks, conducted staged patrols and inspections on Zhonghua Road and Minguo Road. At the same time, all areas where military police were stationed in Nanshi, such as Penglai Road and Xinkai Xinqiao Street, were closed off to pedestrian traffic in stages, while vehicles were still allowed to travel back and forth.</p>
<h3>Two Batches of Japanese Nationals from Southeast Asia Evacuated to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The first batch of 157 Japanese nationals evacuated from Southeast Asia arrived in Shanghai on the French Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes' General Chaffee liner on Monday morning (the 22nd) of this week. They had already returned to Japan on the Asama Maru and Kobe Maru, two ships, the day before yesterday. The second batch, totaling 139 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the French ship the Kaiting, which docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. The Japanese nationals disembarked and transferred to ships to return to Japan within the day. The third batch, evacuated from Manila, consisting of 234 people, has already set sail for Shanghai on the company's D'Artagnan, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow. It is reported that the Kaiting also carried 15,000 bags of贡米 (tribute rice) from Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Chaffee Expected to Arrive the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Also, according to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the American President Lines' President Chaffee and President Grant liners are expected to arrive in port the day after tomorrow on their maiden voyages to Shanghai. Because the ships are the best equipped of all the President liners, many foreigners in the city have booked cabins on the ships.</p>
<p>Polish Jews Granted Permission to Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that according to responsible sources, 29 Polish Jewish refugees who recently came to Shanghai from Japan have been granted permission by the authorities to depart for Palestine within a few days to engage in colonization work. These Jewish refugees were expelled by the Nazis after the invasion of Poland. After residing in Japan for ten months, they came to Shanghai with 226 other Polish Jewish refugees and settled in the Jewish General Association on Muir Road and the Jewish Refugee Shelter in Hongkou. Twenty-nine of them will leave Shanghai on a Taikoo Shipping Company ship, traveling via Mumbai and Basra to Palestine to engage in cultivation work.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a Japanese Military Officer Being Sniped in Hongkou; However, the Japanese Authorities Have Firmly Denied It; Strict Security Measures Suddenly Implemented in Hongkou the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, according to unconfirmed reports circulating in the Public Concession, a high-ranking Japanese military officer was shot and killed by a Japanese soldier on Dixwell Road in Hongkou yesterday (the 26th). However, the Japanese authorities have firmly denied this claim. However, the fact that the Japanese authorities implemented the strictest security measures in Hongkou from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM yesterday may serve as evidence of the unusually serious events in Hongkou starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Chinese People Prevented</p>
<p>Last night, armored vehicles patrolled the northern part of Hongkou all night, and all roads in the northern and southern parts of Hongkou were closed. Many areas and bridges were subjected to strict searches, and the number of sentries was also increased compared to normal, causing tens of thousands of Chinese people to be unable to enter Hongkou. The congestion was similar to the situation after the bridges over the Suzhou Creek were blocked following the shooting of two Japanese people on Ward Road on Monday night. Hundreds of trams were parked along the Bund, end to end, waiting for permission to cross the bridge and enter the Hongkou tram depot. Other vehicles, such as cars and trucks, were also blocked. Countless Chinese people waited on the sidewalks on both sides of the Bund, waiting for the bridges to open. Foreigners were allowed to enter and leave Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Restrictions on Gasoline Purchases; Oil Companies Deny; Confident in Supply</h3>
<p>Executives of the Socony and Texaco oil companies generally believe that it is unlikely that gasoline purchases in Shanghai will be restricted. According to an employee, his company has no such plans and is confident in the future supply of gasoline. It is reported that foreign-supplied gasoline and oil are still being shipped on schedule, and Shanghai has a large inventory of oil. There are rumors that restrictions on oil purchases may eventually be implemented, requiring users to have special oil purchase coupons to purchase a limited amount of gasoline, similar to the measures implemented in places like the United Kingdom. However, oil companies here have denied this claim, as a normal supply of oil is expected to continue to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Business Public Bus Labor-Management Negotiations Commence: Labor Party Proposes Seven Articles, Company Accepts in Principle</h3>
<p>Following the strike initiated on the 25th by workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company demanding increased subsidies, etc., two preconditions were initially agreed upon. Resumption of work was originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, but a temporary misunderstanding caused complications, and the resumption failed to materialize. Yesterday, the workers presented seven conditions for direct negotiation with the company. The company accepted the principles of the conditions proposed by the workers and advised them to resume work first, then consider the matter at length. The workers decided to submit the negotiation process to today's workers' congress for a decision. The British Tramway Company has specially increased the number of trams and trolleybuses on all routes to maintain public transportation.</p>
<p>Labor Party Conditions: The seven conditions proposed by the workers yesterday were: (1) Increase workers' subsidies by 65.54%, including all income of workers, except for rice subsidies; (2) Reduce workers' workload and working hours; (3) Improve personnel management and facilitate leave, with detailed methods to be discussed individually and directly by representatives of each department; (4) Wages to be paid as usual during the strike period; (5) Workers who were dismissed without cause should be reinstated immediately, including drivers No. 65, No. 501, and No. 128, ticket sellers No. 87 and No. 79, and coppersmith No. 1108, whose wages should be paid as usual during the period of sentencing by the court for official business; (6) The positions of workers should be fixed, and they should not be arbitrarily reassigned; (7) The special preparatory class for representatives of each department should be changed to six people, and the status of the representatives should be respected.

<h3>Henderson Ship Carries American Troops to Shanghai for Defense: Expected to Arrive Today or Tomorrow If Weather is Good</h3>
<p>The US Navy transport ship Henderson, with a displacement of 10,000 tons, will be carrying supplies from the United States to Shanghai. This was confirmed by US officials on the US Yangtze River gunboat Luzon. It is said that if the sea weather is good, the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow. As far as they know, the ship also carries a detachment of replacement troops to Shanghai to replace some of the US Fourth Naval personnel who have completed their service in the East and are leaving Shanghai. The Henderson will be berthed in Shanghai for about a month before leaving on the Ryuta Maru, which will evacuate from Japan. Officials from the American Consulate will be on board the ship to return to the country.</p>
<h3>Four Chinese People Suddenly Arrested</h3>
<p>At around 11:30 PM the night before last, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters suddenly dispatched several plainclothes military police officers in two cars to the Public Concession Police Station. They then went with Chinese and Western detectives to the Huaji Apartment at No. 1025 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Because the area was an American military defense zone, Chief of Police Kristen requested ten soldiers from the American defense forces to assist in surrounding the apartment. As a result, four Chinese people were arrested in room No. 2, and some documents were confiscated. All of them were immediately taken to the Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou by the Japanese military police.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Iranian Nationals After the Change in the Situation in Iran: Saying They Are Observing the Situation and Hoping for a Quick Resolution</h3>
<p>There are approximately 607 Iranian nationals in Shanghai, including about 960 Jews and Armenians. They do not express much concern about the political situation in Iran after the entry of British and Soviet troops. They say they are observing the situation and hoping for a quick resolution. So far, there have been no reports from Iran to Shanghai regarding the situation in the country.</p>
<p>The Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai, which is responsible for the welfare of the Iranian community in Shanghai, declined to comment on the reaction of the Iranian community in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yan Chengde Reportedly Mistakenly Kidnapped</h3>
<p>At around 8:50 AM the morning before yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred at No. 666, Tiantong Road, at the entrance of Baoqing Lane. The kidnapped person was Yan Chengde from Shaoxing, manager of the China One Trust Company at No. 270, Beijing Road. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Yan is an ordinary employee of the trust company, a salaried worker, and comes from a poor family with no savings. This sudden kidnapping may be due to a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Ringleader of Copper Ingot Theft Deprived of Nationality</h3>
<p>Last year, a large number of copper ingots stored by the American firm Moller &amp; Co. in a warehouse on Sichuan Road suddenly disappeared. After investigation, it was found that they were stolen by a Swiss man named Huite. However, when he was arrested, he was obstructed by the Japanese and was able to escape the law. Later, the copper ingots were sold by Moller &amp; Co. to the Japanese. It is now known that the Swiss Consul General Fantani issued an order the day before yesterday, no longer recognizing Huite as a Swiss national. At the same time, the punishment for Huite was immediately revoked.</p>

<p>The China Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, in order to safeguard the legitimate trade of legitimate merchants, stipulates that the new Shanghai exchange rate will supply foreign exchange for the import of necessities. It has specially dispatched Chinese Assistant Manager Taylor and British member Holbach to Shanghai to investigate the Shanghai exchange market and negotiate settlement methods with the banking community. They have now been summoned back to Hong Kong to hold a meeting with the Chinese and American members of the Stabilization Fund Committee who have arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing to make a final decision on implementation.

<p>Procedures Required to Apply for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking community that for the import of necessities, it is necessary to entrust the designated banks to apply to the Stabilization Fund Committee in advance. Applicants should first obtain blank application forms, blank approval forms, and blank import certificates from the bank for completion. The application form requires three copies, original and duplicate, and one approval form, all of which should be filled in by the applicant in Chinese according to the format, or in both Chinese and English, and submitted to the entrusted bank for transfer along with the supporting documents. The applicant should pay the bank in legal currency at the same value as the amount applied for in accordance with the regulations on the purchase of foreign exchange for imported goods when submitting the application form, and submit the bank's duplicate receipt together with the application form. After approval and notification, the bank will transfer the foreign exchange to the original applicant, and those who are rejected will be returned to the original applicant through the original bank, and the legal currency prepaid will be returned at the same time. The original handling bank may collect the prescribed handling fee from the applicant for those approved.</p>
<p>Sugar, Oil and Other Categories Obtain Special Permits</p>

<h3>Deliberations on Affairs Outside the Western District Resume: Philippe Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Philippe, the General Manager and President of the Municipal Council, has completed his vacation and returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 26th). The Public Concession authorities and the central area will resume deliberations on matters such as the collection of taxes and automobile registration fees on roads outside the Western District. Philippe went to Japan on vacation a month ago. During his absence, his duties were temporarily handled by Bo Liang, the lawyer of the Municipal Council. Before Philippe left Shanghai for vacation, he consulted with both the central area and the western district on the issue of tax collection and registration fees. The other party proposed a plan for a common registration fee for the concession and the western district. There have also been several talks on the issue of tax collection. It is also reported that the Municipal Council Board of Directors will hold its first meeting after the summer vacation on September 3 to reorganize municipal affairs and discuss various important issues.</p>
<h3>No Definite News on Postal Rate Increase</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that domestic postal rates will increase from September 1, the Datong News Agency reporter learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration that the bureau has not yet received a clear order from the General Administration, so it is difficult to guess whether this statement is true. However, it is certain that it will not be implemented on September 1. It is necessary to have sufficient time to prepare in advance for the implementation of price increases in the past, and it cannot be implemented hastily. In addition to the Shanghai Post Office, other inland post offices have not received orders from the General Administration regarding the increase in postal rates as of now.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a large number of people came to the newspaper office to obtain application forms for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship for Industrial and Commercial Employees.

<h3>A Judge Reprimands a Man for Rape and Assaulting a Female Guide: The Plaintiff Withdraws Additional Charges</h3>
<p>Yang Lianfu, a Ningbo native residing at No. 10, Lane 52, Xinzha Bridge Road, claimed to be the owner of the Da Jiangnan Hotel outside and usually sought pleasure with prostitutes. He had a relationship with Xiangxue Princess, a female guide from the Tao Tao Guide Agency. Xiangxue Princess shared a room at No. 9, Delin Lane, Yunnan Road, with Liu Yaying, another guide from the same agency. The room only had a tatami mat. At 6:00 AM on June 30 this year, Liu returned home from work and suddenly saw Yang and Xiangxue Princess sleeping together. She questioned them, but Yang became angry out of shame and beat Liu, causing her multiple injuries. The case was reported to the police station, and because Yang fled afterwards, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has now been arrested by Chinese Detective Zhang Xingyan of the Old Gate Police Station and sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Chuzhu opened the Fifth Criminal Court for trial. Police Lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law, and Liu Yaying expressed that she did not want to sue. Judge Zhu then reprimanded Yang, "Your actions are not the actions of a righteous person. Seeking pleasure with a prostitute is close to being a rogue, and you even dared to commit assault. You should be severely punished, but since the plaintiff does not want to sue, this court will give you a chance to reform. You should strictly abide by your duties in the future, and if you commit any illegal acts again, you will be severely punished." After the reprimand, he declared that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Broker Embezzles Necklace</h3>
<p>Ding Bowen, a Ningbo woman residing at No. —, Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road (her husband was formerly in the Wanfeng Silk and Satin Bureau and has now passed away), recently entrusted Li Renbao, a Suzhou jewelry broker, to sell a string of diamond-studded platinum necklaces (worth over 10,000 yuan) in Room 208 of the Zhongnan Hotel on the 13th. However, Li embezzled the necklace and avoided meeting her. It was not until the day before yesterday that Ding ran into Li on Edward Road and reported it to Chinese Detective Liu Junjie, who arrested Li and brought him to the Old Gate Police Station. Li's confession was cunning, initially claiming that the necklace was a fake, and then claiming that it was lost by a thief. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court, and Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi requested detention for investigation. Judge Feng reported and ordered detention pending a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Sugar Merchant Zheng Zenan Assassinated Last Night: Gunman Fired One Shot, Hitting a Vital Spot</h3>
<p>A shooting occurred at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Guangxi Road in the Public Concession at around 7:20 PM last night. The victim was Zheng Zenan, a major figure in the sugar industry. The bullet hit a vital spot in his chest, and he died on the spot. The details are explored in the following article.</p>
<p>Zheng Zenan, a native of Meiting Mountain, Suzhou, was 51 years old and a sugar merchant. He was a major figure in the sugar industry and wealthy. He formerly served as the chairman of the Sugar Industry Association and is currently a member of the Executive Committee. He resides at No. 14, Zhoushan Road, in the French Concession. He has a Daxing Marketing and Trading Company in the building, dealing in sugar, grains, and northern goods on a large scale.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Assassination</p>
<p>Due to business entertainment, Zheng was invited by a friend at around 7:20 PM last night to take a chartered car to a Bai Yushuang brothel at the end of South No. 2 Lane, Fuyu Lane, Guangxi Road, for a banquet. When the car arrived at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Guangxi Road, just as he got out of the car, a pre-arranged gunman suddenly drew his gun and fired a shot at him, hitting his chest and passing through his back. He fell down, bleeding profusely, and died immediately.</p>
<p>The Assassin Flees</p>
<p>Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assassin fled with his weapon, disappearing without a trace. Upon receiving the report, the Old Gate Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, but the assassin could not be found. They then summoned an ambulance to the scene and sent the deceased to Renji Hospital, then transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination. The cause of Zheng's death is currently under investigation by the police. Afterwards, according to eyewitnesses, the assassin was wearing a Zhongshan suit.</p>
<p>Family Situation</p>

<h3>Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide in a Room: Woman Dead, Man Also in Danger</h3>
<p>Hu Shidi, a young man from Shanghai, 20 years old, accompanied Ni Cuiying, a beautiful woman of the same age from the same hometown, to check into Room 47 of the Southeast Hotel at No. 12, West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession at 11:00 PM on the 16th. For unknown reasons, the two took poison together that night and committed suicide. It was not until 7:00 AM yesterday that the tea attendant discovered that both the man and woman were unconscious. He immediately reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate and summoned an ambulance to send the man and woman to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, Ni was too poisoned and died before she could be rescued. Her body was transferred to the coroner's office. It was found that Ni was wearing a striped Western-style cheongsam and light red long silk stockings. Her hair was not permed. It is speculated that the reason for the suicide was lack of freedom in marriage. It will not be clear until the family members claim the body.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese Naval Landing Force Headquarters announced last night (the 26th) that the third warehouse of Mitsubishi Corporation at No. 40, Diswei Road, was set on fire yesterday afternoon. The fire was discovered and extinguished by the Japanese who were guarding the warehouse. Earlier, at around 1:00 PM yesterday, 30 workers were loading soybean cakes into the warehouse. At 3:40 PM, smoke and fire suddenly appeared from the resin stored in a corner. They quickly used sand to extinguish it and found two bottles of phosphorus in the resin, one of which was on fire. It was obvious that someone had secretly placed them there to commit arson.

<h3>Responsibility of Harmonizing Five Religions (Continued) Research on National Music After the Loss of the Classic of Music</h3>
<p>Three Systems of Pitch</p>
<p>Although the theories of music and pitch in ancient and modern China and foreign countries are divided into three systems, they are all a compromise of Xuan Ling and are the ancestral sect of pitch for all ages. During the prosperity of Tang and Yu, the eight tones were in harmony. The "Southern Wind" qin emblem specifically used harmonic tuning. During the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty, the teacher's teachings were prepared. Guan, Zuo, Gou, and Lü knew the most about pitch. Guanzi's "Xiao Su" actually measures the degree of string sound. Lü's "Han Shao" is the foundation of tube pitch. Guo Yu's "Li Jun" harmonizes sound and voice. According to Wei Zhao's note, it is Jing Fang's standard. Cai Yong's flute and Liang Wu's understanding are similar. The "Chu Du" measures pitch and stacked instruments, which is the system of the "Qi Qing" in the Examination of Craftsmen. The "Zhong Sheng Huang Zhong Palace" determines the country of singing. The "Chen Jun" of the Book of Rites stops the type of sound. The "He Le" of compound tones is passed down from the Spring Officer. The "Huan Gong" of transposition is recorded in the Book of Rites. The Zhou Feng Ya reached its peak, which was the Sumeru Peak of national music. Confucius learned the qin and listened to Shao, deleted the poems and corrected the music. All 300 poems were sung. After the Classic of Music was lost, the ancient pitch was not transmitted. For two thousand years, the long night has continued to this day. Huainan Ma Ban only understood the standard pitch, causing Zhong Lu to not be able to regenerate. Huang Zhong knew the ancient principles, but did not know the ancient methods. He Chengtain's twelve even pitches restored Zhong Lu. The method is recorded in the Song Zhi, but it is a pity that he did not use the harmonic tuning of the Zhou Dynasty. Liu Zhuo's twelve equal temperament pitches were reduced by three points, the book was abolished and useless. Wang Pu's twelve positive sound pitches in the Later Zhou Dynasty had different weights for Yu and Jiao compared to the old numbers, but the pitch standard was close to "Chen Jun". If one understands Guanzi's saying "return to its original place", it can be circulated endlessly. Qin players all know that the harmonics should sound when they are on the emblem, but they do not know that the real sound must also sound when it is on the micro. The world is confused by the vulgar pitch after the Han Dynasty, and they are used to being wrong. The harmonics are lost, causing the wonderfulness of harmony to disappear, and they doubt that the world's advanced music is not as pure as Western music.</p>
<p>The Wonder of the Intercalary Palace</p>
<p>During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Italians brought Western theories to China, with only six sounds: Gong, Shang, Jiao, Qing Jiao, Wei, and Yu. When they reached Yu, they could not advance further, so they raised Jiao to Qing Jiao and started six more sounds. When Gong could not retreat further, they lowered Qing Jiao to the Jiao position and retreated six more sounds. The key lies in the lowering of Qing Jiao. During the Qianlong period, a person called the New Method appeared and realized that the seventh sound of the variable palace was the "He" of Huainan. Then the positions were used to compose music, and various methods emerged. Our Chen Zhou He Le had already reached the wonderfulness of sound and harmony. One thousand five hundred years ago, Qiu Gongming of the Liang Dynasty used harmony in the full string of Youlan Cao. All the Western harmonies, including the increased and decreased degrees of length, were used completely. After the Sui Dynasty, the Hu customs usurped the orthodox lineage, and there was no one who knew ancient music. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty recited poetry at night and established the Yuefu. The Han Dynasty had the Zhi clan, and the Wei Dynasty obtained the remaining veins of Du Kui's ancient music, which relied on to not decline. The Qin had Qing Ping Ce Se and various tunes. The Southern Dynasties still had Qing music. The Sui Dynasty inherited the Northern Zen, and the music used the music of the sacrifice. The Tang Dynasty integrated the Hu customs and invented the intercalary sound, which was used for the 28 tunes of the Yan music pipa. Ruan Xian's five-stringed bronze pipa in the Jin Dynasty was like the Qin system, with twelve columns, which still existed during the Tang Dynasty. Ling Tingkan's Yan Le Kao Yuan quoted Zhang Hu's five-stringed poem to say that the Tang Dynasty had five. The Song Dynasty's Emperor Taizong added one string to make it six strings. Emperor Huizong did not know how to borrow the Gong string to kill the Zheng and supplement the Zheng Jiao two tunes. The Southern Song Dynasty also changed the Zheng to become ten tunes and eighty melodies. Shen Kuo and Jiang Kui's descriptions differ. Chen Yang wrote Yue Zhu, but it is a pity that the recovery of the Zheng lost the wonderfulness of the intercalary palace, and only the seventh tune of Xiaogong remained, which was the seventh tune of Xiaogong. The Yan music was lost, when will it be restored? Those who have the skill and elegance of music bear this responsibility on their shoulders. (The end)</p>
<h3>A Limestone Boat Sank at the Old Garbage Bridge Yesterday Morning: The Loud Explosion Terrified Residents, the Crew Escaped and Was Fortunately Not Injured</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a limestone boat suddenly exploded and sank at the northern border of the Old Garbage Bridge on Zhejiang Road. According to the investigation, the boat was loaded with limestone from a certain place and arrived in Shanghai the night before last. It was docked on the riverbank at the northern end of the Old Garbage Bridge, ready to unload the cargo yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, when the boat arrived at the port, the bottom of the boat had been slightly damaged and water had entered. However, the crew did not notice it. After a night, the water had filled the boat, and the limestone dissolved in the water. Because the boat was quite large, the huge amount of limestone it contained suddenly exploded at around 9:00 AM yesterday. For a time, thick smoke filled the sky, and limestone splashed everywhere. The explosion was huge, shocking, and terrifying. For a time, nearby residents were frightened and did not know what had happened. At the time of the explosion, there were several crew members on board who were working. Because they escaped quickly, no one was injured, and the boat sank immediately, disappearing without a trace. When the police station received the report, they immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate. The water police also had personnel on the scene to investigate. It is said that the boat and the limestone it was carrying were completely destroyed, with losses of no less than 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Great Asia Company Fraud Case: Perpetrators All Convicted</h3>
<p>Civil Law Immigration Court Hearing</p>
<p>Zhang Mingtong, Gao Ren, and others, employees of the Great Asia Transportation Company at No. 37 Nanking Road, allegedly defrauded fabric merchants by claiming to transport fifty bales of cotton cloth, valued at 76,000 yuan, to Nanking. They embezzled the funds and secretly moved the Great Asia Company to Yuanmingyuan Road. The cloth merchants, through investigation, discovered this and reported it to the Central Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhang Mingtong and others, and they were sent to the First Court for trial. Yesterday morning, a decision was made. Zhang Mingtong was sentenced to one year in prison for jointly using fraud to induce people to hand over property, and fined 500 yuan. Gao Ren was sentenced to eight months in prison and fined 300 yuan. Zhang Weixing, Dong Mingyao, Yang Songtang, Xu Tingrong, and Shen Xiaokang were each fined 500 yuan.

<h3>Silk Broker Defrauds</h3>
<p>Cai Zuoqing, a native of Hangzhou who owns a silk store there, previously purchased silk fabrics worth over 11,000 yuan from Lu Jiazhen, a silk merchant at No. 762 Daqing Lane, Nanking Road. At that time, he first paid two checks worth 8,700 yuan to Lu Chun Zhuang. Upon maturity, when they went to collect, the store claimed that the checks had no funds and were not in the name of the drawer, so they returned the checks. Cai disappeared, and they realized they had been deceived. Lu then hired lawyer Qian Zheng to report to the old police station to arrest him. It wasn't until the other day that Chief Detective Tao Gengrong and others apprehended him. Many pawn tickets and blank checks were found on Cai's person, indicating that the number of people Cai had defrauded was not small. Yesterday, he was sent to the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, requested detention to investigate and recover the stolen goods. Judge Zhu reviewed the report and ordered him to be detained pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Japan Feels Population Shortage, Encourages Childbirth</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the issue of enhancing "human resources" during wartime is extremely important. In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has established a Population Bureau with the goal of cooperating with the people of the country to increase the domestic population to 100 million. Therefore, they are very active in promoting the childbirth encouragement movement. At the same time, they also attach importance to the marriage problems of young Japanese men and women in various overseas communities. Currently, the Welfare Section of the Japanese-owned China Shanghai Railway Company plans to create happy families for 1,000 single employees of the company (600 men and 400 women). Therefore, they have prominently displayed the slogan "Local Marriage, Mainland Bride" (bride meaning marriage), and are acting as "matchmakers," providing appropriate guidance on the marriage hopes and ideals of some men and women. For single employees who have opinions such as fear of marriage and the marriage ideals of married employees, they have specially organized a "Consultation Center," which has been formally established. All single employees can go to apply for registration, listing their opinions, desired conditions, and ideal bride or groom to seek a match. According to Mr. Kitamura, the head of the Welfare Section of the company, marriage is very difficult for young men and women in the mainland. For example, the marriage rate among Japanese residents in Shanghai is only five couples per year. Therefore, he hopes to encourage single people with an average age of 22 for men and 20 for women to marry. For this reason, they have established a marriage consultation center, hoping that all young Japanese men and women in China can form good relationships.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks Accounting Families, Teachers Should Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Zhengya, the statistics director of the Industry and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, broadcasted the compilation of the cost of living index for salaried Chinese classes on XMHC radio the other night. Mr. Cai first explained the meaning and compilation method of the cost of living index, and emphasized the necessity of detailed accounting of income and expenditure. He also said that the response to the call for families was very enthusiastic, and many people automatically applied. However, due to the summer vacation, letters were not easily delivered to school teachers, so there were not many applicants. In terms of the city's population, teachers occupy an important position. It is hoped that they will send their names and addresses to the Industry and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road to facilitate the work.</p>
<h3>Shen Weiya, Owner of Wan Zhenyuan Fried Cake Shop, Assassinated, Three Shots Fired All Missed, Police Arrived and Captured the Assailant</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Chinese-Western Swimming Competition Xu Heng Wins, Overwhelming Western General Flower United's Overall Score Suffers a Small Setback, Women's Relay Hua United Team Wins</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The swimming competition between the Hong Kong Victoria Sports Association and the Western Youth Association, mixed against the Chinese United Team, was held on the evening of August 9th at the Victoria Association Swimming Pool. Almost all of Hong Kong's famous swimmers participated in the competition, and the results were extremely close. As a result, the Western Youth Mixed team narrowly beat the Chinese United team with 16 points to 10. One of the most exciting scenes of this competition was that Xu Ting of the Chinese United Team overwhelmed He Qianchen, a famous Western short-distance general in Hong Kong, in the men's 100-yard freestyle. Xu Heng took the lead at the start, followed closely by Huang Zhaolin and He Qianchen. Swimming to the last pool, He Qianchen sprinted hard. Although he surpassed Huang Zhaolin, Xu Heng had sufficient stamina and reached the finish line first by half a body, with a score of exactly 57 seconds. (The Shanghai record is 57.1 seconds, set by Hammett in 1934) In the women's 300-yard freestyle relay, the Chinese United team was slightly behind at first, but the fourth person caught up with the opponent. In the end, the Chinese United team reached the finish line first by a few inches. However, because the referee believed that one of the players had entered the water before the previous person reached the finish line, they were disqualified, which was a pity. Otherwise, it would have been possible to win in terms of the overall score. In the men's 300-yard freestyle relay, Yu of the Chinese United team took the lead as soon as he entered the water. After that, he gradually overtook the others. The last person reached the finish line half a pool ahead, with an excellent score of 2 minutes 35.2 seconds. The full results are listed below:</p>
<p>(Women's 150-yard Fancy Relay) (1) Hua United (Sha Huiying, Li Baolian, He Huiqiong, Cheng Jiao 1 minute 51.2 seconds), (2) Western Youth Mixed Team, score 1 minute 51.3 seconds.

<p>(Women's 300-yard Freestyle Relay) (1) Western Youth Mixed Team, 3 minutes 25.1 seconds, (2) Hua United, score canceled.</p>

<p>Study Lecture</p>
<h3>Hygiene and Learning Methods (Part 1) (Written for Middle School and College Students)</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In modern China, we certainly cannot adopt the same closed-door, self-centered attitude as in the past. Instead, we should learn from the strengths of others to make up for our own weaknesses. However, the most important thing is to adopt the strengths of others without abandoning our own, to create instead of merely imitating, and to adapt to the current environment instead of simply assimilating ourselves into others. Today, I will only discuss hygiene. Confucius said, "A scholar who is devoted to the Way and ashamed of poor clothes and bad food is not worth discussing [the Way] with." He also said, "A scholar who is attached to his home is not worthy of being called a scholar." It can be seen that the gentlemen of ancient China had different aspirations and did not place much importance on clothing, food, and shelter. However, since Western learning spread eastward, Confucian teachings have been shelved, and clothing, food, and shelter have become the center of hygiene issues and the expression of material civilization. As a result, clothing must be light and warm, food must be carefully selected to be easily digestible and nutritious, and people must go to the beach to escape the heat in summer and to hot springs to recuperate in winter, believing that anything less is unhygienic. Little do they know that this kind of hygiene has become commonplace and outdated, and is completely inapplicable in today's time of national crisis.</p>
<p>Today's youth are the people who will revitalize the nation in the future. Middle school and college students are at the age of development. It is crucial that they do not misunderstand the meaning of hygiene. From a medical standpoint, I will explain the principles of hygiene to you. Originally, people live in hardship on earth at all times. The stimulation of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, and the invasion of various germs are all external insults to mankind. Every cell in our limbs and body has the ability to resist external insults. It seems that nature gives all living things a bad environment while also giving us a tool to resist that bad environment. If we can resist, we are suitable for this environment, which is called adaptation, and we can survive. If we cannot resist, it means we do not know how to adapt, and we are not suitable for this environment, so we are on the road to destruction. However, this ability to resist and adapt can be trained. The more we resist, the better we resist; the more we adapt, the better we adapt. Conversely, this ability to resist and adapt will disappear if we do not practice. The less we resist, the less we will be able to resist; the less we adapt, the less we will be able to adapt. Therefore, the true meaning of hygiene lies in how to train our ability to resist and adapt.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, we can talk about hygiene and learning methods for middle school and college students. 1. Deliberate Hardship. As the saying goes, "Only by enduring the bitterest of the bitter can one become the best of men." Mencius also said, "Therefore, when Heaven is about to assign a great task to a man, it always first frustrates his heart, strains his sinews and bones, starves his body, empties him of everything, and disrupts his actions. In this way, it stimulates his heart, strengthens his character, and enhances his abilities." All these words can be summarized in the sentence "enhances his abilities." I can endure environments that others cannot endure, and I can eat hardships that others cannot eat. If we do not have sufficient resistance, how can we achieve this goal? Mr. Cai Yumen said, "In the dead of winter, one should always wear thin clothes, without heavy fur coats or fire, so that the skin is accustomed to the severe cold, and one should also wipe the body with cold water to enhance the skin's regulatory function. If one practices in this way, one will not easily catch a cold when the climate changes suddenly. Conversely, if one always wears thick clothes, one will catch a cold even with a slight breeze. Therefore, if one does not practice the regulatory function of cold air in normal times, one will easily lose the natural ability to resist. Also, one should usually eat hard things and not absolutely avoid things that are not easily digested, so that the stomach and intestines can practice strengthening their work on a daily basis. Otherwise, if one is always cautious and dare not eat anything that is not easily digested, the stomach will become accustomed to easy movements, and will not be able to handle hard work when encountering something indigestible. The stomach was not weak in the first place, but it has become weak due to excessive caution." For example, when walking, it is best to walk slowly and steadily, and not always look for a substitute for walking. All of these are for the purpose of self-discipline and enduring hardship.</p>

<h3>The Right of Apprentices to Self-Study</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>Whether a person is fortunate or unfortunate in the world is determined not so much by circumstances, but by whether or not they have the spirit of struggle, as Ning Lao says.</p>
<p>Compared to young people in suits and leather shoes, carrying foreign books and going to school, shop apprentices may be unfortunate. However, young people who are apprentices do not have to be discouraged because of this. The future of apprentices does not have to be limited by this kind of environmental misfortune.</p>
<p>Wasn't the Russian literary giant Gorky an apprentice? Wasn't the American scientist and politician Franklin also from a shop? With their spirit of learning and enterprise, the life of an apprentice became a stage for their progress and a cornerstone for their success.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone can have the genius of Gorky and Franklin. Therefore, not every apprentice with the spirit of struggle can become famous overnight. However, a person's success is not measured by their fame. The maximum utilization of time, opportunity, and ability is the standard of success.</p>
<p>Apprentices' after-work reading and self-study are reasonable rights that human beings should enjoy, because the heart of enterprise is common to all, and it can never be destroyed by stubborn thinking and economic pressure.</p>

<h3>"Responding to All Changes with No Change"!</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>The wartime capital has recently been shouting a very practical slogan: "Responding to all changes with no change!"</p>
<p>This was advocated by our leader. Because the international situation changes rapidly, if we want to keep up, we will have to hold meetings all day long. However, the leader believes that the established national policy will absolutely not change due to environmental shifts, and will always use "no change" to deal with the "ten thousand changes" that come one after another. Short history has already told us that the leader's understanding is accurate.</p>
<p>Now, this "no change" doctrine regarding national policy has become widely adopted as the principle of life for the people of the wartime capital. It seems that everyone will grit their teeth and tell you: "No change!"</p>
<p>Many people from other places might think: the wartime capital, with its tense work, high cost of living, and terrible air raids, are they probably as anxious as ants on a hot pot? In reality, you see, the wartime capital is like a slight ripple, like a nightingale, like a gentle poem, so calm that you can't believe it! This is the fruit of "no change."</p>
<p>Isn't Miss Ouyang the most fashionable one in your class? Tell you, she is also learning "no change" now (of course, this is not to say that fashion remains unchanged, but to say that she will no longer transform herself into a fashionable person). According to her:</p>
<p>"Two cloth shirts have faded. I thought about making two new ones, but Shilin cloth costs one yuan and eighty cents per foot! Later, I thought about redyeing the old ones, but the dyeing fee for each one would be six yuan. Okay, I'll still wear the faded ones!"</p>
<p>In fact, isn't what Miss Ouyang is doing a true reflection of the general population in the interior? Keeping up with the times in terms of "outfits" is no longer what we want. Fang just came from Hong Kong and talked a lot about perms in the style of flower baskets and cloud ladders, which made us laugh so hard that we almost lost our teeth. Don't look down on our curled banana hair, it's really generous!</p>
<p>For the past two years, the salaries of our agency have remained "unchanged," but we are not discouraged. In spirit, we will return it with "no change"! The problem of the government providing us with "public rice" (thirty yuan per dan) has been solved. What else do we want?</p>
<p>With no money in our pockets, we are still humming tunes in our mouths. The wartime capital has many such people! We are not optimists, this is a manifestation of inner strength!</p>
<p>It can be said that the compatriots in the wartime capital have realized that the will and strength of individuals are two-dimensional, while the collective is three-dimensional; therefore, "concentrated will" and "concentrated strength" will become the foundation of victory.</p>
<p>"Responding to all changes with no change" has transformed from a slogan into a way of life. The people of the wartime capital have achieved at least this much in terms of "concentrated will."</p>
<p>Military Affairs</p>
<h3>Handheld Flamethrower</h3>
<p>— Sizhong</p>
<p>When the German army was fighting in the Balkans, they used a handheld flamethrower, which made our country aware that there is another most terrifying new weapon on the modern battlefield. That weapon was designed and manufactured by experts and has five uses. The soldiers who use it are specially trained and wear fireproof asbestos clothing to avoid injury.</p>
<p>The basic function of the flamethrower is to spray flames and scorching hot oil. It also emits toxic carbon monoxide, which can be fatal in airtight spaces. It can also absorb the oxygen in the air, preventing tanks from moving forward, because tank engines require oxygen. Another function is to create an effective smokescreen to protect the soldiers who use it. The last function is to greatly demoralize the enemy and make them unwilling to fight.</p>
<p>This German-invented flamethrower works best when attacking tanks and hidden pillboxes. Streams of flames shoot into the tanks and pillboxes through the openings, making the inside of the tanks and pillboxes as hot as a furnace. Even if the soldiers inside can withstand it, the flaming hot oil drills in along the gaps and produces carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The maximum range of the handheld flamethrower is over a hundred feet. Each unit continuously sprays fire ten times, and each burst of flame lasts about one second. The soldiers who use it have two cylinders strapped to their backs, one containing oil and the other containing compressed air. When the soldier opens the vent valve, the oil is ejected from the nozzle, passing through a fuse wire and igniting.</p>

<p>"People always have a conscience." Her own father had already offered Shang Lao Er such favorable conditions, and Shang Lao Er was also a person, and he should have a conscience. If he thought carefully, he might not come back to pester her.</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, she had a glass or two of wine with Wang Shejian and three other boarders who had arrived earlier. Everyone's spirits were lifted, and Wang Shejian said:</p>
<p>"Anyway, school hasn't started yet, and it's still the first month of the new year, so let's indulge ourselves today. Mei Ying, I heard you sing opera very well, sing a section for us to listen to!"</p>
<p>With the teacher saying this, how could the other two students let Mei Bao refuse?</p>
<p>Mei Bao couldn't resist the dead缠 of the three classmates, and she had also drunk some wine, so she was already four or five parts drunk. She did as they said and sang a section of "Sacrificing the Pagoda" a cappella.</p>
<p>After singing, everyone of course praised her in unison for a while.</p>
<p>"Who taught you? Mei Ying." Fang Shejian squinted her old eyes and asked in a blurry drunken tone, her usual shrewd and rigorous attitude nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"At first, a teacher taught me." Mentioning the words "teacher," Mei Bao's heart jumped unconsciously. "When I went back last winter, my father was very happy and told me several more operas. He taught them much better than the teacher taught. Because he..."</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the wine, Mei Bao was about to open her mouth and tell the whole truth when the school worker Chen Da suddenly rushed into the dining hall. (196)</p>
<p>Invention</p>
<h3>Flying Electric Clothes</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>One important and difficult problem in modern aviation is the clothing of pilots. In the high air, the temperature is often lower than on the ground, so aviation personnel have no choice but to wear extremely thick and heavy clothing when flying. However, this kind of clothing is quite inconvenient for driving. Recently, American inventors have manufactured a new type of electric clothing that is lightweight and convenient, using electric current to maintain the temperature of the clothing. Even in the high air where the temperature is sixty degrees Fahrenheit below zero, the pilot's body temperature can still be maintained at a normal level. This type of electric clothing has now been successfully tested and has been adopted by the U.S. Army authorities.</p>
<p>If the German army really wants to invade Britain, they will probably use this treasure again. The main intention is to demoralize the people and reduce their resistance.</p>

<p>— Jiang Zhigang</p>
<p>Why are men always taller than women? Let me tell you first, this is not a physiological problem, but a serious problem of social system! A "tutor" believes that this is "caused by the male-centered system!" This is because of nutrition. In a feudal society centered on men, women are under the oppression of men. All good and beautiful enjoyments are always first enjoyed by men before it is women's turn. Although the initial difference is extremely small, so small that it is almost invisible, after hundreds or dozens of generations, women will naturally be shorter than men.</p>

<p>In the Free Talk "Substitutes in the Sound of National Defense" on August 5, "Plastics" as "clay" seems inappropriate. Most scientific magazines now translate it as "model material," which seems more appropriate. This kind of item is most suitable for making models.</p>

<h3>Good Boss</h3>
<p>— Jiangshui</p>
<p>In Chicago, USA, there is a man named Otto Ashum, who is generally called "the best boss in America." O.E., here we will use the name his employees are used to calling him, runs a vegetable oil company in Chicago; his company is like a sweet family. The company provides free breakfast to all employees every day; O.E. himself sits at the same table with them for meals, talking and laughing, and asking each employee if there is anything they are dissatisfied with in the company. If they feel dissatisfied, they can boldly tell the boss so that improvements can be made—but there has never been a word of complaint heard other than the sound of everyone sipping coffee. On the ground floor of the company, O.E. has also set up a game room, equipped with ping pong and poker, for employees to play in their spare time. For female employees, this boss can be said to be flattering, sending them many books, candies, cosmetics, socks, etc. every month. At the end of each year, he gives each employee a letter, telling him (or her) what areas they should improve. Employees must write back to him, answering whether his observations are correct.</p>
<p>Since the company was founded in 1911, this boss has never fired an employee or reduced a penny of wages. Employees have also never had a single quarrel or strike. O.E. also uses his spare time to write history books. He believes that only with mutual understanding and cooperation between employees and managers can business prosper.</p>

<h3>Invisible Aircraft</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Recent reports from Europe say that the bombers that Britain usually uses to bomb German industrial centers are painted with some newly invented paint. When searchlights on the ground shine on these planes, they are invisible.</p>
<p>According to another report, the U.S. military is already using a special light yellow paint that absorbs light, so even if planes painted with this paint are illuminated by searchlights, the light reflected into the enemy's eyes is almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Aircraft used during the day are painted with two colors on the fuselage. The abdomen is painted blue to blend in with the sky, and the back is painted a darker color to blend in with the color of the land. With this method, it is difficult for the enemy above and below to see the fuselage.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Chrysanthemum Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Shaoxian</p>
<p>Cheng Yuqing's Many Romantic Affairs (Part 2)</p>
<p>There were two major merchants in the former capital, namely the Yue family of Tongrentang (a famous pharmacy in the north) and the Meng family of Ruifuxiang (the largest silk store in Peiping). The Yue and Meng families were not only wealthy businessmen, but also opera fans. Just talking about the Meng family of Ruifuxiang, the shopkeeper (i.e., the boss), Mr. Meng, spent no less than tens of thousands of gold on supporting Xu Biyun every year. This Mr. Meng favored many people, and one of his fourth concubine's adopted daughters, named Zhang Meiyun, loved to sing opera since she was a child. After Mr. Meng's death, this fourth concubine simply let Meiyun formally apprentice to a teacher. Her enlightenment teacher was Li Jizhi (Wang Yaoqing's disciple, who was Li Lingfeng, Zhang Junqiu's teacher). At that time, Zhang Meiyun was only a teenager. Her artistry is aside for the moment, but the little girl's love of romance cannot be ignored. At that time, because she was learning opera from Li Jizhi, she indirectly got the chance to meet Zhang Junqiu, and she actually fell in love with Junqiu. Li Jizhi, on the other hand, had high expectations for Junqiu and strictly disciplined him, so of course he couldn't sit idly by. To avoid trouble, Li Jizhi actually declined to teach Zhang Meiyun opera because of this.</p>
<p>Meng's fourth concubine lived in the Da Ma Shen Temple, and Wang Yaoqing's house happened to be across the street from the Meng family. Zhang Meiyun often went to Yaoqing's house, and the people in Yaoqing's house all called her Little Sister Meng. Since Li Jizhi stopped teaching Meiyun opera, Meiyun often went to Wang's house to ask Yaoqing for advice and wanted to apprentice to Yaoqing. However, because she was Jizhi's disciple, Yaoqing couldn't accept her because of seniority. However, she called Yaoqing "teacher" in a childish and innocent manner, talking to herself. Yaoqing agreed because she was a child and she was calling him in a muddleheaded way. So everyone tacitly acknowledged that Zhang Meiyun was Yaoqing's disciple. And Yaoqing himself called Cheng Yuqing, the "eldest brother," to teach her opera precisely because he treated her as a disciple. Who knew that this eldest brother's intentions were not purely to teach opera, and he actually committed adultery with Meiyun under the guise of teaching opera, to the point where Meiyun had three abortions in a row. Until recently, they seemed to have reached a point where they could no longer hide it, so Yuqing publicly stated to Yaoqing that he wanted to take Meiyun as a concubine. However, because Yaoqing believed that Wang Yuqing was currently unable to support a wife, how could he take another concubine? He tried his best to persuade Yuqing, and at the same time, because Yuqing's wife, Hua Huiwen, came to Yaoqing to cry repeatedly after hearing the news, Yaoqing more firmly expressed his disapproval of this matter. Who knew that Yuqing would bear a grudge against Yaoqing because of his strong opposition, leading to this beating of the teacher. Although Yuqing would tell people afterward that the lateral reason for this incident was Huang Guiqiu's apprenticeship, this was actually his "excuse." In the end, Yuqing's ability to flirt with women was too great, which harmed his life. The evolution of this incident was still due to "sex."</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Professional Women"</h3>
<p>— Tan Feng</p>
<p>It is fortunate to have the opportunity to see the professional women performed by the postal workers' union. First of all, the script was well chosen. It is a bomb, using its power to give the authorities under evil forces a severe blow; it is a small knife, using its sharp edge to shatter the masks of the generally fake gentlemen; however, it is also a beacon, using its light to guide those who are willing to improve to their proper direction!</p>
<p>Performing this play is meaningful, and I personally feel that performing this play is even more meaningful in terms of the status of the performers. No matter from which aspect, you can feel their efforts. It is indeed gratifying that an amateur theater group can have such excellent results. The most successful actor is Chen Zhitong, who plays Director Fang. His pronunciation and movements show his rich stage experience. It's just that the entrance at the beginning of the second act is too rushed, which seems a bit inconsistent with his yawns to express fatigue. Lu Weihua (as Zhang Fenglai), Zheng Guisheng (as Zhang Jinzhong), and Li Song (as Changfu) all have good acting skills. Unfortunately, the pronunciation of the flower girl Guo Pu is not correct; Li Jikuan's pronunciation is too weak; Fang Yizhuo is too greasy, and Li Jimeng is almost stiff. The rest are still competent. The lighting and position are beautiful.</p>

<p>Chapter 15 Where Does a Rich Man Forcibly Take Her Home</p>
<p>Therefore, the mountains carry the hatred of parting, and the water contains the sorrow of separation. The scenery along the journey increases the melancholy. The strange customs of the foreign land and the words that are unpleasant to the ear make people even more uneasy. After arriving in Yanjing, Tian Hongyu snatched Yuanyuan to his mansion. When many people, both superiors and subordinates, saw Yuanyuan's bright eyes and white teeth, delicate eyebrows and rosy cheeks, they had rarely seen such a lovely lady, and they all felt that the makeup of the whole family was dull. They were both surprised and happy, both jealous and envious. Tian Hongyu built several red buildings separately to house Yuanyuan, preparing to choose an auspicious day to formally take Yuanyuan as his concubine. Unexpectedly, his daughter Tian Fei heard that her father had brought a new beauty from Jiangnan, Chen Yuanyuan, back to Beijing and wanted to take her as a concubine. She immediately sent a eunuch to invite him to the palace, saying that she had important matters to discuss with him. Tian Hongyu did not dare to be negligent and immediately went to the palace to see his daughter. After sitting down, Tian Hongyu said, "I just returned from tomb-sweeping in Jiangnan and haven't come to see you yet. I also have some local products and southern embroidery to send you. I don't know what important matters you have to discuss with me?" Tian Fei said, "I heard that Father brought back a beauty from Wuzhong, named Chen Yuanyuan, and wants to take her as a concubine. Is this true?" Tian Hongyu couldn't help but smile slightly and nodded, saying, "There is such a thing. I made a short stop in Suzhou this time I went south. One day, I went to Lingyan to visit and happened to meet a beautiful woman. I was amazed by her beauty. After being told by someone, I learned that this was the famous Chen Yuanyuan. Later, I went to her pavilion to linger for several days. How could I not have feelings? So I loaded her on a jeweled carriage and brought her back. Are you laughing at me for being old and not losing my heart? Haha!" As Tian Hongyu said this, he raised his beard and laughed. Tian Fei said with a smile, "Food and sex are human nature. I know that although Father is old, he is always a self-proclaimed romantic. Once he encounters such a beauty, how can he give her up? Naturally, he wants to hide her in a golden house and enjoy her company." Tian Hongyu laughed and said, "You're right, it can be said that a daughter knows her father best!" He laughed again. But Tian Fei said to her father, "Chen Yuanyuan is indeed a natural beauty. If I may be so bold, I want to borrow this beauty from Father. I wonder if Father can allow me?" (153)</p>
