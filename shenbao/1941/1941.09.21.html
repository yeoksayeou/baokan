<p>社評</p>
<h3>特夫古柏的正論</h3>
<p>英國特派駐遠東大員特夫古柏連日正在訪問荷印，事畢並擬一遊澳洲，然後折返星加坡，與駐華英大使寇爾會晤。毫無疑問，在這美日談話若斷若續之中，特氏依據他的原來使命，正在加緊遠東ABCD集團的密切合作，他的表示當然多少可以代表此一集團的共同意願。他在離開星島之前，曾對美國記者發表談話，力言：一余深信華盛頓無論與東京作何談判，均必絕對尊重中國權益」；抵達巴達維亞之後，他又兩度發言，先說「目前遠東局勢之靜寂，決非美國犧牲中國而與日本談判所致」，一咋又說：「時局現處於睡眠狀態中，惟不能遽認為危機已過」同時暗示荷印倘被人攻擊，星島英軍有立即遺往助戰的可能。</p>
<p>從這兩段簡短談話，至少可以看出兩點，即第一，英美絕對不致背棄中國，第二，美日進行試探談話，雖係事實，但遠東民治陣綫的警備和合作，却絕未因此稍見鬆弛；如果有人因為美日談話的不能進行，而遽認為遠東大局就此便可高枕無憂，那正和因為美國企圖用談判方式去壓制日本，而誤認羅斯福總統蓄意犧牲中國以緩靖日本，犯有一樣的錯誤。在日本陸軍發言人揚言「無論有何反對，決定進行對華戰爭並取獲荷印原料」的同時，特夫古柏却偏有危機未去，以及英軍決助荷印的明快表示，雖然可能是一種偶然的巧合，却未始不含着針鋒相對，不甘示弱的意味。</p>
<p>本來，吾人早就說過，日本對美談話，根本不是誠意修好或澈底悔禍，實際不過因為客觀環境與內在條件，暫時均不利於進行新的冒險舉動，加以英美的經濟制裁又着實足以制孤立的日本於死命，於是樂得乘美國準備騰出力量應付歐局的機會，和華府進行談話，以期延宕時日，略蘇經濟窒息之苦；但不論談判已有成議或尙在進行之中，國際時局萬一發生些須意外變化，使日本從新獲有可乘之機，則任何人敢斷言東京的急進份子，必然捲土重來，故態復萌、一切諾言，一言保證乃至一切協定，均將等於廢紙。正因為這個原故，吾人歷來對於美日談話，母髯認為羅斯福總統苟非別有作用，或同樣地意在延宕時日，以期於實際用兵之前，在各方面尤其是在遠東聯防方面，完成必要的準備，則殊覺其多此一舉。</p>
<p>觀於特夫古柏的僕僕風塵以及中國軍隊的尙未實行總反攻，可見遠東ABCD集團的整個陣綫，雖已確立，但其中有關技術上的各項具體辦法，尤其軍備供應與兵力合作問題，似乎也還有積極充實調整的餘地，因此上面所說羅斯福總統對日談話，意在乘機完成必要準備的一種解釋，或者也還不無理由。在中國立塲而言，最可怕的中，是美國一方和日本接洽，一方却懈怠了接濟遠東民治集團的工作，可是現在事實證明絕對不然，不僅羅斯福總統在租借法實施報告中已有加緊援華的表示，其所派多至四十人的軍事代表團行將來華即以特夫古柏一昨所言荷印方面已有優良戰機二千五百架，大多來自美國一事而論，也就足夠證明美國的反　略政策，以及保衛遠東完整的決心，絕未變史。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下下吾人認為最重要的一點，倒是民治陣綫本身，包括中國在內，切勿因為最近若干所謂「休戰」空氣，而疏忽了應有的戒備，或弛緩了必要的佈置；基於上述日本不能信守任何的束的理由，不問美日談判將來是吾有成，在遠東禍源沒有根本剷除之前，決不許誤認危機已經消逝，一昨特夫古柏的談話，正是對於遠東每一個民治勢力的切要警告。</p>
<p>日本密切注視　歐洲戰局發展</p>
<p>東報吿政府外交審慎</p>
<p>路透社二十日東京電「中外商業新聞」令日預測如列寗裕勒·基輔·與奥迪薩在冬季蒞臨以前相繼失守、則德蘇戰局即可決定、英美未有襄助蘇聯阻止德軍前進之能力、不久蘇聯將改變其戰爭政策、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十九日東京電日本「廣知時報」頃發表社評、勸吿政府勿將日美兩國現階段談判情形輕予發表、略謂雙方政府在談判之際、每有涉及較大目標之階段、政府權衡輕重、自可將此項目標向國民公開、以便得其贊助、或防止反對行動、特在目前，國際局勢錯綜微妙、折術外交者偶一不愼、即蹈危險、故人民對於最高當局及其負責各顧問、應寄以全部信心、不可造次、須知外交談判、猶之商業談判、　銖必較、政府人員允宜單獨行動、不使公衆參雜其間、非然者、彼等倘能成功、果將獲得信任因而克保職位、若不幸失敗、則唯有出於引退之一途、殊非善策云、</p>
<h3>美日談判　在進行中　羅斯福招待記者未披漏會談性質</h3>
<p>路透社二十日華盛頓電　昨日羅斯福總統招待各報記者時、不允討論與日大使野村會談之性質、謂衆在過去二十四小時中、對於日本問顥或遠東局勢、並未開有任何新穎消息、羅總統又表示渠與國務卿赫爾星期五日之談話中、並米涉及遠東問題、並稱渠幾時時與國務卿面晤或通電話、共商一切國際發展云、</p>

<h3>烏克蘭戰事劇烈　德稱佔領基輔城　莫斯科倫敦尚未予證實　蘇軍堅强抗敵寸土必爭</h3>
<p>合衆社二十日柏林電　德國高級司令部昨日發表特別公報稱、德軍於突破尼泊河西岸之堅强砲壘以後、巳於咋晨開入烏克蘭首府基輔城、</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　德方雖官傳已開人基、惟蘇聯中午發表之公報、並未宣布該處局勢有何變化、僅謂烏克蘭首都區域之戰事極為激烈、倫敦方面對於基輔失陷之說、亦無證實、認為德方宣傳、未可憑信、蘇車司令部或決定將强大部隊留於凸出地點、以實現其預定計畫、德軍在茂曼期克區域、亦無繼續進展消息、蘇聯陸車喉舌紅星報謂德申近攻逼基輔各入口、共損折車隊十師、坦克車數百輛、及飛援數百架、基輔如確被德軍佔領、雖將予蘇聯以重大打擊、惟德方在其四周作戰多日、亦已遭受慘重之損失、基輔之業業尙不能認為極端重要、德軍如再東進、則蘇聯之戰爭工業將受更跋重之威脅、</p>
<p>路透社十九日莫斯科電　此間承認基輔形勢嚴重、但守城軍民迄未放棄寸土必爭之決心、德軍曾於八月上半月進攻時、以二萬人葬身沙塲與大批戰具盡被摧毀之代價、一度直抵基輔郊外、卒因守軍力抗被迫退却、今叉不顧空前損失、再攻入基輔防綫之某部份、</p>

<p>海通社二十日柏林電　德軍佔領基輔消息之首先抵柏林者、係由戰地記者森克以電話報告、據稱吾人於咋午夜全副武裝渡小河入基輔城、我人集於河岸時濕冷抖戰、惟齒未相擊耳、吾人爬至防綫時、始奉命攻擊、手溜彈與擲火器變管齊下、第一座防禦工程奪獲後、知即將遭遇秘密警察隊、吾人步步為營、至薄暮基輔全入吾人之手矣、該城之軍火康先由飛機炸後、乃以最大口徑之大砲猛轟云、</p>
<h3>英國代表團　啟程赴莫斯科　大批戰具源源自美運蘇</h3>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　率領英代表團赴莫斯科之不管部大臣皮佛勃洛克勳爵、現已起程赴　、臨行前會謂英工業已加緊出產俾可全力援蘇、並將建造空前未有之大量坦克車、</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（八）（二）　史太林防綫的構造</h3>
<p>這篇也是紐約泰晤士報的紀戰：</p>
<p>蘇聯的防務確是別創一格。現已名聞世界的「史太林防錢一，係將法國「瑪奇諾防綫一化整為零，成為現代最新式的防禦工事。設計者是蘇俄最有名的軍略家杜嘉契夫斯基上將，可惜他已在一九三七年淸黨運動中被犧牲了。</p>
<p>這種防禦工事中的許多單位，都造成圓形，宛如輪輻。俄國人稱之為「倉」。其形狀雖有參差，但其佈置都是可以向四面八方射學的。它一旅以上，常是篆成三角形。們的大小各有不同，有些可以至於這些三倉」如何配合，各處駐兵一團，有些可以駐兵一旅却不一致。。有些是獨立的，有些是互相這種防禦工事，以彼此密聯接的。聯接的一種可以駐兵切策應為目的。其中有幾種「倉」尤其是較大的「倉」，容易看得見，因易誘敵來攻。但敵人一朝進攻，即易陷入隱藏着的許多「倉」的火網之內。這些隱藏着的「倉」多用泥草偽裝（俄羅斯人以擅長偽裝著稱），數以千計。多數倉」備有戰車棚，並儲藏大批汽油，這樣，它們便成為前綫的戰車站，如覺難以久守，便可隨時加以炸毀。「倉」中汽油的貯藏量聞極可觀。蘇聯農村平時所用的汽油，都集中在集體農塲。一遇到危急時候，他們便把這些汽油運入「倉」內部特設的油庫，不使點滴洛於敵人之手</p>
<p>許多較大的「倉」，尤其是各大城市四郊的「倉」，都裝配着高射砲，可從砲門發射。這種「倉」，各依其大小，還裝置着各種口徑的大砲，安置在特別砲位裹，與主要部份隔離，並用機關槍及噴火器加以保護。「倉」裹面有壕溝通至外面，守軍可由這種壕溝退到附近的森林中。</p>
<p>這些壕溝深的六呎，並無掩監。底層和兩側係用木塊和特種鐵絲支持，使之結實。守軍撒退的時候，當地的農民便駕着偽裝的牽引車，把砲運去。德軍戰報所稱「包圍」字樣，往往耶指包圍這些「倉」而言。</p>
<p>「倉」和壕溝，建築雖簡，工事却極堅固，都是用最精鍊的鋼板的水泥築成的，裹面電燈和自來水都全備無缺。自來水的供給在蘇聯最關重要。</p>
<p>這種工事在戰術上的作用很為顯明，誠　蘇聯軍官們所說，「用以像海綿一般吸收敵軍」。紅軍利用這種策略，把大隊敵軍首尾不接，無法獲取其預定的戰果。敵方負責突破防綫的戰車先頭部隊，反被切斷了。他們要是轉而向那些「倉」進攻，閃電的效力就此消滅。因此，德軍戰報所述，其先頭部隊已攻入敵軍陣地，是否有效，實不能令人無疑。</p>
<p>分散敵軍的主力攻勢，使之個別應戰，並隔離其先頭部隊，實是這種化整為零的防禦工事的最後目標。紅軍就利用這種防禦法；並借用德軍參謀部所慣用的作戰秘訣，鍥而不捨的與之週旋，卒使德軍無法進展換句話說，蘇聯的防禦戰略，在利用本國人力的衆多，把戰綫延長來分散敵方的兵力。在上次歐戰期間，德軍向帝俄軍隊展開鉗形攻勢，鹵獲大掛俘虜，但在這次戰爭裹，德軍僅在波蘭方面紅軍佔領區內，即在沒有建築這些二倉」的塲所，獲得同樣的俘虜而已。德軍最近一次戰報曾謂，蘇聯仲出六十隻「手臂」，應付德軍。這種離奇的軍情報告，顯亦指「會」的　備而言。作戰至令，蘇聯很能利用這種員額白優勢，一方面駐守數千個會，一方面仍有餘力，編成流動部隊，隨進隨地迎擊敵軍。他們並能徐徐地退却，一面避免大規模的運動戰，一面誘敵陷入預定防綫，加以殲滅，使攻軍的損失，反較紅軍日戰且退時的損失為大。　紅軍「倉」的防禦工事選有一種優點，就是敵軍不能預測人造成的障碍，究至何種程度。在這種情勢之下，强渡河流，佔據山頭或　取鐵路　又點，反而比較不重要了。換言之，天然障碍的重要性，反因人造的障碍而減輕。這些人造的障碍，其重要性不下於砲臺，德軍對於列寗格勒屢攻不下，即以肚故。</p>
<p>蘇聯這種防禦工事，外間鮮有所知，即其片段亦未流　於外。然而德國參謀部自命得　，「史大林防綫」的內幕，他們未免錯估　這種防綫在戰略上的價值了吧。（完）</p>

<h3>草地綱球遍級單打　王許昨奪得決賽權　王文正直落三淘汰唐寶嘉　許承位苦戰五盤勝國璠</h3>
<p>本屆草網高級單打複賽、華將四騎士王文正·許承位·李國璠唐賢嘉、昨日下午三時起會師於協會球塲、分別交綏、爭奪決賽權、鑒於華將一統天下之奇蹟、而來作壁上觀者、竟達千人、國產球迷、佔絕對多數、盛況空前、複賽結果、王文正以直落三淘汰唐寶嘉、許承位則苦戰五槃、反敗為勝淘汰李國璠、許李之戰、驚險百出、相常精彩、王許將定期決賽、昨日複賽結果如下、</p>
<p>兩組表演</p>
<p>王唐之戰、在一面倒形勢之下、唐寶嘉幾無招架之力、無論抽殺攔網、王文正仟意縱橫、若非王拍下留情、竟將全軍覆沒、許承位李國璠兩人、俱珊珊來遲、直至四時半才開賽、兩人實力幾難分彼此、旗鼓相當、勝負有賴於幸運決定之、論技術李國璠似稍勝一籌、惜乎在可勝之局面、以荒亂不穏定而遭敗績為惜、苦戰達兩小時之久、兩人俱精疲力竭、開球上綱許不如李、但反手則為許之傑作、大有乃兄許承基之作風、其正反手之斜角抽、亦展有妙擊、但抽球之造就尙淺、李國墦之開球有林寶華之風度、有力而深入角底、惜乎咋李野球之送分纍纍、以致轉勝為敗也、</p>
<p>激戰經過王唐之戰、第一槃王一氣呵成五局、唐始奪回一局後、王即以六對一輕取、第二盤王仍先連得五局、繼放一滑局、而以六對一再捷、第三盤唐擊破文正發球先勝一局、但又瀉千里、連失六局、比數又屬六對一、總結直落三、許李繼之作戰、李國璠演出之老練與體力之充沛、均估優勢、惜李旣以二此一估先、第四盤由一比五落後</p>
<p>而追成五比五、卒仍功敗垂成、被許以七比五造成各二、深為可惜、第五盤最後一局、司綫員誤判好球為出界、失去得局點、否則成各五平手、故勝負實有幸有不幸也、第一二三盤李國璠完全佔得優勢、第叫槃局勢一鬆、許遂以五比一佔先、李雖追成各五、未能竟共全功為惜、最後決勝、李於三比二後、許連得三局、而以六比四得勝、</p>

<h3>紗花　都只為游資充斥　棉紗買氣騰騰</h3>
<p>紗市續佳、漲風賡進、同時現紗銷路皎為起色，港幫對於二十支中下兩等之紗、需要稍盛、買去的計三百包左右、其他三二支四二支均無胃口、於是人心良好、多頭又助威勢、惟雙為廠單絕少交易、所以市面並未十分向榮、但有一部份因原料關係、做多看升、不過價格如果提高、放空者亦不乏人、就此而論、多空兩方之陣容、相當的堅固也、二十支雙馬最高價為一千七百五十八元、低價為一千七百四十五元、收盤價為一千七百十三元、但收盤以後、市塲上謠風忽來、賣者叢集、做至一千七百四十五六元之說、目前紗市情况、照正理看好、然默測過去之走勢、往往是相反也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開承上日之漲力再進、首盤價為一千七百五十元、此盤一開、樓面上人氣熱烈、買氣騰騰、所謂檯面歸」致搶進、少頃即升至一千七百五十七元、旋後聞取引所開盤昂、二槃軟、人心稍懈、跌至一千七百四十六元、但現紗廣帮採辦不弱、又復升至一千七百五十八元、嗣後大戶之多額稍有吐出、市狀帶軟、耶疲至一千七百五十三元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千八百四十包、二十一日有紗二百八十包運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　三〇〇南洋　四〇</p>
<p>同行　八、五〇〇統計八、八四〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、緩步翱翔、脚地較為穩定、雖美棉續降有勁、而一般買戶頗有在此沉悶之氣氛中、不欲久持觀望加以游資之充塞、當以吸收為宜、且云現紗客銷未動、故廠單做開即呈堅定、更因大戶之左右、使市氣站挺、期紗經此憑藉、人心當呈煥發、尤以本月交易行將交割、於多方拉提下、空頭殊有扒補、是以市價上升、九月期以一六六八元高價做開、十月期為一六七四元開盤、十一月期為一六八三元、初開成交、入於迂廻而參差、中途以取引所堅而復軟、近期會軋小至一六六四元、十月期降達一六六九元、十一月期亦隨低至一六八一元、迨至收盤時、浮多又來購進、故各好上二至四元、結果近期為一六六八元收市、軋漲六元、十月期為一六七二元、亦升四元、十一月期以一六八二元、漲起二元、茲將成交價格列表於後、</p>
<h3>外棉連跌不已　現棉吃戶乏勁</h3>
<p>現棉情况、略帶平庸、交易亦不及上日之踴躍、實因外棉速下、紗市無大瞄頭、投機人心雖一味看高、然正實吃戶乏勁也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市，先因蘇俄政治消息利空、及紐奧倫斯軟弱而跌、續後又因空頭抵補略有回漲、昨日收盤價格、較之上日約跌二十七八磅音，</p>
<p>印度棉市先因棉商套賣大量多頭了結而跌、但續後又因一部分獲利買進略漲、昨日收盤價格各跌四羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市况、繼續看小二·七五羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、無疑因海外直接定棉、目下暫無發展、各方僅能就現棉羅致而巳、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌均平、滙豐小櫃檯價又呆定、英美匯黑黑市華商投機多頭願以美匯五元一二五出籠求對軋、迄難獲對手、而一般不准申請之進口商扒四元七五亦無應者、故價仍的美匯四元七五、英匯二辦土八一二五、據聞平準會對於呢絨與糖等一般較正當進口商亦將沽計供結外滙、在商討中、更聞不准申請之進口商、在向外商洋行接洽、今後將以美金栗買貨云、</p>

<h3>證券　內債微挫</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市為週六祗做上午一盤、於十一點開始、丙種首先開出為七十二元二角、但一時賣氣極湧、不旋踵而打破二元、而見一元六角低價、原因為叉有發行軍需公債十二萬萬、多方為之氣餒、陣綫為之衝破、環境上亦變為利空、惟多方未必即肯罷手耳、昨開槃積記聯益九成怡泰買進、而賣方若仁豐大中大華鑫豐華昌奮勇賣出、遂使行市直綫下降、雖潤德生大鴻大信孚尙有需要、而樂茂尙有大批賣出、鼎康順泰聯和亦有源源供給、致收盤僅丙戊種稍稍回堅、其他各種均仍疲莫能興、市價結果一律回小四角半至七角、成交總數共計一百五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米先漲後落</h3>
<p>昨洋米先漲後落、結果反見疲小近元、緣早晨承昨晚漲風、人心均在望好、目實消幫週末添辦甚濃、而杭州等內地浙幫亦到市擭辦碎米及中關各米、市上買氣極旺、各米售價一致上升、小紋現米到一百零七元、一號西貢到一百十九元、二號一百十元、其他各米一致上砌、小絞英華司亦開至一百三十四元半、比之前晚收市價曾漲元外、然漲後耶有浮多吐出、且以謠言利空、散戶趁高吐售甚力、市即直下、銀行棧小絞即自一百零六元半小至一百零五元半、英華司亦小半元、其他一致跟小、結果反比前晚小去元許、成交仍有一萬四五千包、英華司三四百噸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米市、其來源旣以搬運不便、日到有限、而銷塲皆係本鄉店舖應實胃口、同時市面亦脚踏實地、較有準則、不若洋米之升跌無度、昨際洋米兩朝好面、人心頓亦堅昂異常、新破兩粳均屬暢銷、悉見提升二三元、計開南港新　早破百五十三元、陳破百五十元、浦東新粳高自百五十三元半、次至百五十元零五角、至於無錫厚破粳猶以到稍銷淡、未聞做開、</p>

<h3>本客辦粉續旺</h3>
<p>昨洋粉早晨頗見興旺、因承前漲風、本客頗有隨市添辦、而週六實銷納胃亦佳、兼以存粉逐有轉口問津、新定迄未續妥、人心向上、市價逐砌、西棧金龍自三十元零七角漲至三十元零八角、東棧三十一元五角半、砲臺自三十二元六角六角半至七角、香蕉二十二元半、均比前市漲起二三角、然至午後進戶突稀、浮戶獲利求了結者、亦未克儘興售出、市面立轉懈怠、後市西棧三十一元七角半售開後、繼即三十元零六角亦乏受戶、而成交則不足萬包、惟小麥存到兩枯、市形續見挺秀，</p>
<h3>油市　連油有來滬消息　油商噤若寒蟬</h3>
<p>食油市况、近因到湧銷滯、疲莫能興、頃聞津靑方面仍有大批源源而來、同時大連油亦有來滬消息、致一般油商均噤若寒蟬、不敢再事居奇、其他紗花及米業等投機幫亦深嘆無能為力、故市勢終感支持乏術、遂步下瀉不已、昨日各貨行情比前又跌二在五元、計售開靑島生油及豆油二百餘桶、大有廠淸油八千多担、日華廠菜油五千桶左右、立德及吉田廠菜油各一百桶、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<h3>疋頭　秋銷進展</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市微昂、乃因謠風已息、同業及囤戶進意轉濃、本客幫實銷因時令關係、需要亦有進展、故布價一致趨漲、白貨粗細布斜紋漲二角半至五角、漂染布一部份上漲五角之譜、成交因週六關係、均見减少、本街約一百餘件浙東疋海幫辦粗布等四五十件、粤港南洋幫辦粗布斜紋漂染布等二百數十件、二十一日有疋頭三件、運新嘉坡、三百六十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　取引所龍頭期布因空頭抵補、逐盤升騰、本月份回漲六角、十月至十二月漲二角半至三角九分、而現貨市塲、則　漲二角、龍頭細布新廠單收槃時五十九元一角、老單五十七元九角、色貨四君子嗶嘰新單新稅每碼一元二角三分七五、老單一元一角六分五厘、亦較前日升五厘至七厘半、</p>
<h3>防雨布暢銷</h3>
<p>防雨布　目下西服幫頗為暢銷、本街客埠需要較前為旺、因其質　身骨各種深淺顏色、與來路貨抱別林相仿也、而抱別林每碼刻售四十元左右、該防雨布祇售六七元左右、金熊老牌防雨布、因出世較早、大有供不敷求之概、於是同業中如仁泰寅變·雙鹿者近多紛紛大量生產、其售價且比友生每碼便宜數角、　買方所需求者、仍多喜用金熊老牌、昨仁泰人猿泰山及寅　鑫記牌子、一律批沽六元五角、友生金熊老牌為六元九角、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂甚堅　荷赤獨疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市有荷蘭電報、粗砂十月份與十一月份裝船照CI．F＆．K．G．例價為美金七元三角半、故申市粗砂甚堅、公司期貨月底期開槃百卅五元三角至卅四元八角、收盤卅五元、升二角、十月十日期開盤一百卅六元三角至卅五元九角、收盤卅六元三角、升四角、現貨劃盤九月份到貨一百卅六元至卅五元八角、八月份一百卅五元四角至五角、七月份一百卅五元至四元八角、六月份一百卅四元四角、升度與期貨相等、太古車白DY嘜一百四十四元、HX嘜一百卅八元、微降五角、H嘜車赤一百十四元、荷赤一百廿三元五欠至廿二元五角、計小一元五角、成交額因値週末、故不旺盛、共計二萬七千餘包云、</p>
<h3>海味　海蜓到貨陸續</h3>
<p>海蜓邇來到貨陸續、走銷尙不寂寞、如中條海蜒刻售三百七十八元至三百八十五元、杜花四百六十五元至四百九十元、其勢穩定、</p>
<h3>軟木櫧（一）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>軟木櫧是蜀於彀斗科櫟屬的一種喬木。生於我國的一種，分布在雲南。四·湘·江蘇·浙江等省，是落葉喬木，能高到二十五公尺。生於地中海沿岸像西班牙·葡萄牙·法國南部·意大利·西西里島·阿爾日利亞等地的一種是常綠喬木，最高能到二十公尺，普通只是六七公尺。兩種的形熊很是相近；就是它們的葉是互生的，作長橢圓形，柄短，質厚，邊緣有鋸齒，背面密生白或灰白色的軟毛。花單性，雌雄同株：雄花排列成長穗狀花序，普通是下垂的；雌花生於葉腋或枝端，為頭狀花序，却是挺然直立的。果實為堅果，下生碗狀的殼斗。</p>
<p>現在軟木的出產地，以西班牙萄葡牙為巨擘，能供給全世界需要的過半數；所以地中海附近的那一種軟木櫧史能引起我們的注意和興趣來。以下所描述的一切，全是拿它作為對象的。</p>
<p>軟木櫧從初生到五六歲的時候，它的外皮是光滑的，以後就慢慢的種裂起來，這種裂痕在年老的樹上有時很深，能　到三十公分——一市尺——的程度。這層外皮是絕對不能當作我們普通所說的那軟木用的，歐洲人稱「雄性軟木」。必需把這層雄性的外皮剝夫，然後機能在這層裹而生出那細軟　有伸縮性的「雌性軟木」來。</p>
<p>實在說起來，一總的櫟——或名橡，　。植物，全能生產軟木；就是它們全能利用它們的形成層」，往內生產綠色柔組織，往外生產木栓組織，就是軟木。所以軟木也不過是些已經死亡了的組織而巳。可是在柔的櫟枓植物呢，這種軟木伸人到木質部極深，而且是沒有固定的處所的；以致弄的木質和軟木層層相間，我們是一點也沒有法子去利用它的。至於「軟木櫧」這種東西呢，它的形成層永遠是在木質部外邊而不是遷徙靡常的；雖說最初也是硬性軟木和軟性軟木間隔發生，——這種層决有時可以在一隻瓶塞上看的非常清楚。——不過從十歲以後，它的產生軟木的機能走上了軌道，往後也只是按步就班的產生軟木了。</p>
<p>第一次剝去外皮——雌性數木——的手續，只能在樹生的第十五年頭上進行，這時樹幹的周圍大概有三十公分了。人用斧刃或鋸在樹幹上斫成兩種割口：一種是周圍着樹身的，一種是直上直下的；然後用那鴨嘴形的斧柄，把這形如「砲筒」的樹皮掀開取下來。從此以後，樹的形成層要慢俊的產生那精細的軟木了：然亦每决必需等到十年或十五年頭上，——這完全要看樹木所處的環境如何向定。——軟木繼可以長到三公分上下的厚度：這時也就可以按着以前所述的法子把它採取下來了。不過，或是剝去外皮，或是採取軟木，人總不應該一下子把樹身剝的精光，把它弄成「赤條條一絲不掛」的樣子，以致受外界空氣的侵凌而傷亡。有一個名叫CapgrandMothe的法國（？）人，繼第一次大發惻隱之心，怕被剝去褲子的軟木櫧羞澀難堪，而想到給它披上一件外套；就是用破布或剝下來而毫無價値的雄性軟木圍繞在樹的身上。結果呢，所得到的軟木更為精細，也沒有很多的窳隙的地方。更附帶聲明一句：剝去外皮或採取軟木，大概是在從六月十五日到七月十五日的一個月中進行；樹則從五十歲到一百五十歲是出產品質最佳的軟木的時期。（未完）</p>

<h3>上海今午一名半鐘　可見日偏蝕奇象　被蝕部份達百分之九二　如天色陰暈將影響測</h3>
<p>今日上海及中國中部一帶、均能看到四百年來第一次之日全蝕、此次日全蝕於中午十二時左右、首見於蘇聯中亞細亞、二十七分鐘後、開始由新疆入中國境、向東南引經靑海。甘肅·陝西·湖北·江西·而於·時半由閩北出口、下午三時左右則止於臺灣之東北部、月球之隱影、至是乃與地球告別、在中國境內經過時間約八十分鐘、全程約二三千五百公里、就各他能見之日全蝕之時間言、以閩北二分二十一秒為最長、唯如現時中國東南部測候狀况、至為不利、故在福建觀測、難收圓滿結果、觀測地點、似以甘肅及俄國最為便利、全蝕之平均闊度、酌為一百三十五公里、上海能見者、祇為偏蝕、在下午一時三十分（新時間）、太陽表面百分之九十二將被月影掩蔽、</p>

<p>據專家預測上海初虧（日月二輪第一次相切）時間為下午零九分、食甚（即大偏食）時間為一時三十分、復圓（日輪完全由月影退出）時間為二時零四分、全中國可見日全蝕之地帶、約為八省一百十六縣、以上地區、所見日全蝕、由食旣（日輪完全掩蔽）至生光（日輪初由月影退出）最長時間為三分二十秒、</p>
<p>欣逢良機</p>
<p>此次全蝕誠數百年來罕見之天象、以假定中國面積為全球五十分之二、則全蝕帶中心落在中國之機會、每百年內祗有一次、就時間及地位言、能在黃河長江一帶人烟稠密區域、於中午可見、在過去五百年為、除明代嘉靖二十一年七月乙酉黃河流域發現一次外、今日為第二次、兩次距離足有四世紀、故今日我人能見日全蝕、實為千載難逢之機會、</p>
<p>破除迷信</p>
<p>靑年會敦請之江大學工程系主任徐籙氏演講日蝕、於昨日下午四時在八仙橋該會舉行、講題為「日蝕原理及其觀測方法」歷述日蝕之不是奇事、自有歷史以來、巳不知發現過多少次、惟上古時代都存迷信觀念、及今科學昌明、日蝕的時刻、可以預先計算、這一次的全蝕、眞是百年難遇的機會、對於日蝕原理、反覆警喻、發揮藄　、</p>
<p>璀璨奇觀</p>
<p>據徐氏演講稱、在日蝕前之一剎那、月球黑影、自西向東、漸向日輸切合、此時月球成為一黑影、足證明月球本身、不能發光、在日月二綸切合之四週見一色球、四週發出烈熖、據記載此烈熖高　數萬英里、太陽黑點、即為烈熖噴出處、在全蝕時、所見烈焰、形色不同、有似蘭葉狀者、有似噴泉狀者、有似衝擊而出者、火焰最大者、最沂離噴出處、約有數百萬央里、在烈焰上、且有强烈光錢放射、煌輝燦爛、蔚為奇觀、</p>

<h3>如何觀測日全蝕</h3>
<p>— 徐家匯天文臺臺長茅虛司鐸著</p>
<p>記者昨日午後驅車到徐家滙，訪徐潤農司鐸，蒙其介紹得謁見天文臺代理臺長茅若虛司鐸（Lepere　K．Dumas,S．J．）。茅氏為著名的天文學者，名滿天下，特於全蝕日在申報發表一文，說明觀察日蝕最優的地點，具有科學上的價値。至於此次全蝕論文，將在十月份中國國民雜誌上（La　Revue　National　Chinoise）發表，關心日蝕者，尤有一讀之必要也。譯者誌</p>
<p>一九四一年九月一十一日之全蝕，給予觀測日蝕者一個選擇觀察地點的良機，因為全蝕陰影，經越地帶甚廣，大約有七千公里以上的距離。全蝕時間前後計七分四十秒，雖不極長，但已足供觀察之用，而滿蝕時間，計二百零二秒。日蝕途程，自西北而東南，中分亞洲大陸為兩部，經過各種不同的地域，有高原，沙漠，河流區域，由嶺地帶，以迄於中國之東南海岸。日蝕在北高加索日出時起始，牠的陰影漸進而通過裹海和蘇聯的中亞細亞，其後從西北入中國領土，穿過這個國家的心臟，把全部領土分成兩部，然後離去中國領土隱沒於太平洋中。</p>
<p>全蝕帶——在中國通過的程序，已在附圖上詳細說明，係於八時三十七分（新疆邊區時間）入新疆省境，全蝕帶之平均闊度，約為一百三十公里，此后只用八十餘分鐘，循東南方向，掠過中國全土，計有四千公里的距離。</p>
<p>日蝕陰影先后經過的地帶如下：新疆省境內的天山山脈和塔克喇麻干沙漠，北部的塔里盆地，靑海省北部，甘肅省南部，陝西省南部，湖北省全部，浙江省南部一小部份，和福建省北部。陰影地帶內的名城亦復不少，例如新疆省的庫車和輪臺，甘肅省的臨洮和天水，省會蘭州僅在陰影範圍之外，陝省的鳳縣和安康，湖北省的保康和咸寗以及武漢三鎭，江西省的九江和永修，以及省會南昌，福建省浦城。建陽。福安，以及其他著名的城邑茲不具載。全蝕地帶經過中國本部人烟最稠密的地力，跨越許多公路和重要鐵路綫七條，計有隴海路。平漢路。粵漢路·南昌至湖南之路。南潯路全綫。南京至南昌之路。浙贛路，同時在湖北省渡揚子江上游。</p>
<p>報載中國政府業己派遺觀察隊兩隊，至福建甘肅準備紀錄日蝕之現象，在最近的將來，必有良好的報告，呈現於吾人眼簾之前也。</p>

<p>吉姆森氏煞費苦心</p>
<p>今夏市區迭告泛濫、市民咸責當局之不顧防水事宜、殊不知工部局工務處長吉姆森巳在悄然擬具計劃、克服有關細則種種困難、卒已擬定上海泛濫問題之解決辦法、聞工務處會作各種實騐後、始完成其計劃、而以確切具體的建議之方式、呈交局方、至於此項計劃之實施、將費若干時間、方可竣事現尙未能確悉、惟有資格人士謂、為期當不出兩載、苟從工程之重大着想、則兩年之期、不可謂久上海因地勢低窪、故從不可記憶之時期起、即為泛濫所苦、每逢傾盆大雨、雖僅數小時即止、亦恒使中區尤其是界外馬路區積水為患、</p>
<p>防止泛濫於滬有益</p>
<p>上海因此所受損害、迄無準確數字可得、然估計年　百萬元以上、以農業觀點言、種植蔬菜者對於上海、咸感失望、故本市所需許多蔬菜、幾乎全仰外埠供給、公共租界中心商業區與法租界各大通衢之屢成一片汪洋、亦令市民大感不便、近年泛濫尤甚、故各方之斥難當局、亦較往年為烈、有資格人士相信、欲求完全防杜泛濫、實係非工部局所能為之巨大工程、縱使可能、該局亦難籌措巨額經費、然任何計劃、能改善泛濫局勢者、均於本市有益、</p>
<p>濬浦工作不容偏廢</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局核准該局工務處長吉姆森所提之防水計劉、而決定撥款四百萬元以實施之、公共租界納稅人乃料捐稅又將加重、若干人士稱、局方應作更堅强之努力、使濬浦局在上海四週恢復疏濬工作、方為上策、上海泛濫之最重要原因、厥為廿六年戰事爆發以來、浦江及昆連本市之各河浜、缺乏疏濬、除非恢復疏濬工作、則工部局擬實行之計劃、必告失敗、徒令納稅人加受不必要之重負云、記者頃以此數點叩諸工部局　言人、據答稱、防水計劃不致失敗、</p>

<h3>日蝕的觀察和實騐</h3>
<p>— 張春綠</p>
<p>日蝕，真是一種宇宙的奇觀。在青天白日下，忽然有一個黑影自西而來，逐漸地把太陽遮住，頓時變成黑暗的世界。幾分鐘後，太陽又慢慢地露出臉來，仍舊照耀着大地。但這種現象，是根難得看見的。據天文學家說，每一百年間發生的日蝕平均有二百三十八次，其中全食僅六十六次。如果把某一處地方說起來，那末看到的機會更少了，每隔三百六十年，才能看見一次。</p>
<p>我門幸運得很，今天的中午，恰好有一次日蝕；而且這一次日蝕，在新疆，靑海，甘肅，陝西，湖北，江西，福建，浙江等省有些地方，都可看到日的全蝕。我們住在上海的小朋友，也可以看到日的偏蝕（只有一部分被蝕）。許多科學家特地帶了各重義器，到全蝕的地方去觀測，因為這是幾十年來難得遇到的機會啊！</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們雖沒有觀測的儀器，又不能跑到全蝕的地方去。但是不能錯過這個機會，用肉眼來觀察一下。假使偏蝕時日光太强，肉眼不能逼觀，可以戴上一副太陽眼鏡，或塗墨的眼鏡，也可以從顏色或塗墨的玻璃片中透視。如果在面盆裹放些淸水，再倒些墨汁進去，攪勻了放在日光下，使日光從水面反射而觀察，就可以許多人一同觀察了（如上圖）。至於日蝕的原理，想小朋友們早巳明白了。那是因為月球繞行到了太陽和地球之間，遮住了太陽射到地球上的光，地球的一部分在月球後面的黑影裹，這時便成日蝕了（如上圖）。要深切明瞭這個道理，你們可以用簡單的方法，親自做一個實騐。用燭光（或燈油燈亦可。）代表太陽，皮球（或別的東西）代表月球，自己的頭代表地球，如果一者同在一直綫上，那末燭光就被皮球遮住，日蝕的成因也是如此。如果把皮球向上或向下稍稍移動一下，就可以看到一部分的燭光，這正和日的偏蝕一樣。再移動行，燭光畢露，可以表示雖有時月球在太陽和地球的中間，而不發生日蝕的原理（如中圖）。</p>
<p>新愛的小朋友們！觀察和實騐是研究科學的重要工作，可以幫助你們揭破自然界的神秘現象，專出自然變化的真理來。小朋友們，試試看！</p>

<h3>日蝕是怎樣？</h3>
<p>— 𠶀</p>
<p>弟：哥哥，日蝕到底是什麼東西？關於天文學，我在學校裹學得很少，幾天前我在報上看見今年有日蝕，並日這區域大部份在中國呢！</p>
<p>兄：天文學的確是很深奧的科學，不過日蝕，尙不難簡單的解釋清楚。</p>
<p>弟：那末請你用最簡單的話，解釋我的疑難。</p>
<p>兄：好的，就開始吧！太陽射到地球上的光綫，被月球在中間遮斷了，叫做日蝕。完全遮斷，地球上看不見太陽叫做全蝕。遮斷一部份，仍舊能看到太陽，不過缺了一塊，叫做偏蝕。</p>
<p>弟：月球比太陽小得多，怎能遮住巨大的太陽光呢？</p>
<p>兄：是的，月球是很小的，所以日蝕的區域是地球很小的一部份。不過它在日蝕區域能遮斷太陽光的道理，可以拿實騐來證明：先閉起你的左眼，拿一個銅元放在右眼前面半尺左右的地方，向太陽看去，不是看不到太陽嗎？</p>
<p>弟：啊！是的，假使沒有銅兀的話，我的眼睛一定睜不開來。</p>
<p>兄：因為銅元把你向太陽的視綫遮斷了，只能得到從旁反射過來的光綫。並不像日蝕時完全黑暗，因為日蝕面積大，旁邊反射光綫不能達到視綫範圍，當然是黑暗了，現在把你的左眼睜開來向太陽看去……</p>
<p>弟：我被逼得睜不開了。</p>
<p>兄：這因為銅元太小，絕不能同時遮斷兩隻眼睛的視綫，眞如日蝕時，甲地變成黑暗，乙地仍舊光明的。</p>
<p>弟：聽說還有一種叫金錢蝕，到底是什麼玩意兒？</p>
<p>兄：地球繞太陽旋轉的軌道是橢圓形的，所以地球和太陽的距離是有遠近的。當太陽離地見較遠的時候，月球只能遮斷太陽中央的部份，所以看上去像一個金錢，你不妨拿銅元來試試。</p>
<p>弟：哦！我想起了，在中國習俗中，有一種叫做「野月吞食家月「我們叫做月蝕的。一定是地球在中間遮住太陽射向月球的光了。</p>
<p>兄：不但在月創的時候如此，並且平時月球的盈缺，也是與地球及太陽有關係的。</p>
<p>弟：天文家對於太陽認識得巳很淸楚，為什麼還是孜孜不倦的研究呢？</p>
<p>兄：當然，學無止境，想由此再得新發現罷了。並且近來有一位叫愛因斯坦的，創造很多學說，有許多是和以前不同的。許多科學家為要證明他的學說是不是和事實相符，所以對於事實非加詳細的觀察不可。不過這種科學是更深奥，不能簡單解繹的。</p>
<h3>體溫的高低</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>妹妹的寒熱病到了下一天的早晨，就退了一些。這一天，　親起了一個大早，便來看妹妹，摸摸　額角，寒熱雖退去了不少，但還沒有退盡，一夜有了這樣良好的經過，巳使伊老人家的心安定了許多，不然，提心吊膽，非但昨天的夜飯少吃了一半，就是晚上連睡覺也不大着脗了。</p>
<p>「幸而妹妹的寒熱退了一些，否則，侄是件很討厭的事。」母親面現喜色，柔聲說着，這樣便不致驚動了妹妹的睡覺。</p>
<p>「不錯，要是體溫再上升，的確是很危險的，「阿亮的爸爸隨口說着，但是這句話在母親的臘海中，是帶着些不大吉利的成份，只得叫阿亮的爸爸和他不要再逗留在道裏，於是阿亮跟着爸爸到了另一間房中去了。然而這句母親認為不吉利的話，鑽進了阿亮的耳朶中，便湧起了一個問題。</p>
<p>「爸爸，那麼一個人身體的溫度，最高能到多少麽？」阿亮輕輕地問。</p>
<p>「一個人的體溫，如果到了華氏一百零七度，那個人便一定不能活了，百分之一百是可注定他死的；就是到一百零五度，巳是很危險，然而還有綫希望，因為身體一到了這樣高的溫度，身體裏面好似在發燒，腦筋便會停止作用；如那個人的身體本來是不强健的，即使到了一百零五度，也要吃不消血死去。不過，最奇怪的，像在夏天，氣候炎熱非常，寒暑表的水銀柱升到一百二十多度的時候，我們仍舊可以工作，而不會熱死的，要是熱到一百四五十度，人也不會因炎然而死去，這是不是很奇怪的一回事，倒底是什麼迫理呢？增完全是我們身體有出汗的本能，否則，也難免要熱死的，因為氣候愈熱，我們出的汗也愈多，並且這種氣溫高的地方，一定很乾燥，這樣便能够使你的汗很快的蒸發掉，身體也隨着覺得凉爽些了。人的體溫雖不能高過九十八度點四的標準，但也不能過低，如低過了六十六度，也會死去的，這時身體裹的血管受到了體溫低的影饗，而發生麻痺，血液的流通，也因而有阻礙，以致僵死，所以每一個人的體溫都一定要達到這九十伋度點四的標準，不能多一些或是少一些，不然便宜不能算是健康的人，而且凡是人類都有這樣標準的體溫，不論他是黃種，白種，黑種，紅種等不同種族的人，他們的體溫大都是相同的，這也是一件很希奇的事。」阿亮的爸爸才關了他的話匣子而出去了。</p>

<h3>談早塲電影的種類</h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>各影戲院除頭輪外，每於星期及例假日上午開映早塲電影，顯然的，這是便利一般平日無暇的人們，特別是學生。這裏撇開正片的早塲不談，單談談幾張經常地作早塲開映的影片。一般說來，早塲影片的水準，是相當地高的，雖然早塲開映的影片，實際上並不是往日賣座最盛，佳評最多的片子，早塲影片總不外乎三類：</p>
<p>歌唱片常佔早塲影片的最多數；這自然因為學生界特別愛好歌唱的綠故，狄安娜實萍的歌唱片似乎最受人歡迎，如「滿庭芳」「荳蔻年舉」，「丹鳳朝陽」，「小烏依人」等，使人百看不厭，其次，如「翠堤春曉」，「戰地笙歌」，「鸞鳳和嗚」，「鳳凰於飛」，「雷夢娜一等片，也都是値得一看的美藝歌唱鉅片，受觀衆熱烈擁護，自非偶然。</p>
<p>戰爭片及類乎戰爭的偉大塲而的影片，其受人歡迎程度，也不减於歌唱片，埃洛爾弗林的「英烈傳」，「羅賓漢」等，最令人愛看，其次，如「戰地英魂」，「古城末日記」，「十字軍英雄記」，「新水滸」等，也往往使人感到有重看一遍之必要，因為實在太偉大動人了！</p>
<p>歷史片與文藝片，由於含有動人的題材，故常吸引大量觀衆，尤其是知識水準較高的人們。如「天長地久」，「麥高句祿」，「雙城記」，「聖城」處女」，「春殘夢斷」，「茶花女」，「傾國傾城」，「塊肉餘生」等片，莫不意義深長，有時為迎合兒童起見，有「小公主」，「小木蘭」等片開映；或者恐怖片如「怪人復活」，「恐怖之夜」等，或者滑稽片如「怕老婆」，「壽頭丘八」等，或者卡通畫片如「米老鼠集錦」，「唐老鴨」等，水準就低一些了！</p>
<p>此外値得一提的，有幾家國片影院，放映舊片如「十字街頭」，「馬路天使」，「迷途的羔羊」等，倒也別有風味。總之，早塲影片的水準旣高，而價格又格外便宜，這實在予平日無暇的人們以莫大便利呢！</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>歌后登龍術</h3>
<p>— 增旋</p>
<p>「歌后登龍術」側重女主角曼麗瑪丁的歌唱，演出風趣。曼麗飾醉心歌舞的女郎辛蒂，歌喉不像珍妮麥唐納那麼高越，却甜潤淸脆，高低音都婉囀悅耳，演出也很盡力。從普通美國語調，改說美國南部調，更覺別致。</p>
<p>男主角唐亞曼契自一紅花艷曲一後，已演過幾本性質相似的歌舞性，相當受觀衆的歡迎；不過總覺得他的臉部肌肉，不十分靈活，所以演戲沒有驚人處。大約派拉蒙公司是慕名而向二十世紀福斯公司借他來演「歌后登龍術」的。本片中唐飾導演勞埃特，戲雖不少，但演技不比以前精彩，看來今後也不會有大進步了。</p>
<p>「歌后登龍街」的英文原名譯義是吻別男友」，馬路旁的本片大廣告上也繪者女郎高仰朱脣「候吻」。但所謂「吻別男友」，祇是片中支歌的名稱而巳，和劇片本身毫無關係。</p>
<p>本片幾支歌，都稱動聽，歌舞塲面，不算偉大，閑角中的沙喉黑人羅却斯德，跳得一脚好舞，在本片中，祇短短的一幕滑舞表演，不見新穎。劇情似乎很平凡，女主角辛蒂大的是富家女郎，却在紐約的百老滙應徴舞台歌女落選，導演勞埃特南下物色女角，辛亟南歸故里，計誘勞至其宅，辛則裝腔作勢，載歌載舞仍未中勞意，乃强隧勞返紐約，勞卒為辛之美色所惑，許以主角席，辛因細　疑勞欺弄，大恚，在歡迎　中故意賣弄風情，當衆歌時，盡卸衣裙，僅剩浴衣裹體，窘辱勞氏，歌舉黯然返鄉，勞追　至，解釋誤會，訂白首之盟，於是銀幕上映出唐和曼麗抱擁將吻時，回頭向幕下觀衆說：諸位，完了。」這個「噱頭」倒是初見。</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Complete Preparations in the Far East to Prevent Further Japanese Aggression. Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras is Confident that U.S.-Japan Negotiations Will Uphold Promises and Not Harm Chinese Interests</h3>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 20th. Before his recent departure for Batavia, former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, granted an exclusive interview to a United Press reporter. According to Mr. Aras, "I am deeply confident that Washington, in any negotiations with Tokyo, will absolutely respect the rights and interests of China." Mr. Aras also told the reporter, "The American people have decided to stop aggression. The free nations of the Pacific and the East must maintain their independence and integrity." When asked about his impressions from his recent trip to the United States, Mr. Aras stated, "The entire country, including the Midwest, is united in destroying Nazism. I am fully aware that the people there (in the Midwest) fully understand the dangers the United States faces in the international situation." Mr. Aras also pointed out that the resolution passed by the American Legion at its convention in Milwaukee reflects the attitude and determination of the United States. Regarding the situation in the Pacific, Mr. Aras said, "Rumors and misinformation have been constantly spreading, claiming that the United States advocates a policy of appeasement in the Pacific. However, this is merely wishful thinking." The Far Eastern situation has greatly improved recently due to the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that the increasingly solidified Singapore fortress will be the defense line for the entire East and the Pacific. It is reinforced by the powerful bases of Hawaii, Midway Island, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand, making its strength more than sufficient to resist any aggression that disrupts the peace of the Pacific. Mr. Aras stated, "People in my country have told me that the Dutch East Indies is currently building strong defenses and is in excellent contact with us and the United States." During his flight from Hawaii to Singapore, the pilots included two Dutch rubber plantation owners who briefed him on the defenses of the Dutch East Indies. They said that all Dutch people spend a day and a night each week training and working with the local troops. The Dutch East Indies has 2,500 excellent aircraft, mostly from the United States, and its coastal defenses are impregnable. They said their only major concern was parachute landings, so they are focusing their training on combating parachute troops. Finally, Mr. Aras said, "As long as the powerful U.S. fleet remains in the Pacific, it is doubtful that Japan would dare attempt to land in Hawaii, as this would be tantamount to suicide." Mr. Aras emphasized that the future of humanity depends on the effectiveness of democratic national defense. "For civilization to achieve its highest progress, Britain and the United States must have a deep understanding, and the Pacific will become increasingly important due to advancements in transportation and the development of resources," he said.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 20th. Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas, Governor of the Straits Settlements, declared today in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter that Britain and the United States will cooperate with any country that hopes for peace in the Pacific. However, Britain and the United States are determined to prevent "massive aggression." Sir Thomas stated, "In recent months, Britain and the United States have developed reasonable and necessary cooperation in the Pacific." He said that Washington fully understands the problems in the Pacific, and Britain is also making every effort to avoid making mistakes due to lack of preparation. Sir Thomas emphasized that modern warfare relies on economics and industry for 75 percent. He said that the supply of rubber, tin, and other raw materials essential to American industry, commerce, and agriculture is in the Pacific and the East and is controlled by countries friendly to the United States. Sir Thomas also warmly praised President Roosevelt's ability to understand international affairs in detail and to demonstrate his great leadership in a vast continent where differences of opinion are inevitable. Sir Thomas also stated that supplies from the United States have already arrived. Although the Lend-Lease Act has not yet been practically applied to Singapore, all future imports will be shipped in accordance with the Act. He said that before requesting any supplies, the actual defense needs of the Straits Settlements, especially regarding steel, are being thoroughly considered by the supply director. He declared that American assistance is highly valued, but he hopes that this assistance will increase due to the common problems of Britain and the United States in the Pacific. When asked about his views on the situation, Sir Thomas replied with a smile, "I am not worried about the past, nor have I ever been worried."</p>
<p>If the Dutch East Indies is Attacked, Britain Will Swiftly Come to the Rescue</p>
<p>Mr. Aras will Meet with Mr. Clark Kerr</p>
<p>United Press, Batavia, 20th. Former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, strongly implied yesterday that Singapore troops may be immediately dispatched to the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Aras has a special mission in Singapore. He criticized Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Far East, for saying that British troops stationed in Malaya could not defend the Dutch East Indies without direct approval from London. "I believe the British will take the quickest possible action (if the Dutch East Indies is attacked). The Netherlands is our ally."</p>
<p>British Outpost in the Far East Becomes a Strong Fortress</p>
<p>Impressions of an American Reporter Visiting Singapore</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 20th. The impression gained from a fleeting visit to Singapore is that the area is already prepared to act when necessary. The authorities are determined to avoid the mistakes of unpreparedness made in Europe. Singapore's defenses are being strengthened daily, and troops are constantly arriving here from the mother country and various parts of the Empire. These troops are among the best in the Empire, eager to fight. Singapore is a springboard for protecting the eastern Pacific, and its defense plan is the same as Hawaii's. If any war occurs in the Pacific, it is clear that naval and air forces must be used to protect the security of naval bases and to attack enemy ships, supplies, and transportation centers. Many new air bases with underground storage rooms are scattered throughout many areas. These airfields have many American aircraft. Singapore's naval base has 22 square miles of deep-water anchorage, more than enough to accommodate the combined British and American navies.</p>
<p>Our Assistance Will Not Be Delayed." Regarding the general situation in the Pacific, he said, "Australia's responsibilities in the Pacific and the world are increasing daily. Australia is now taking active action. Its development is similar to that of the United States before the Civil War." Mr. Aras also said that the purpose of his trip was to meet with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies to lay the foundation for an "ABCD diplomatic front." He also stated that in addition to assisting the British Ambassador ("Governor-General") and Consul-General in political matters, he also hopes to promote closer British-Dutch relations. Regarding Japan, Mr. Aras said, "Things are currently in a dormant state, but it cannot be said that the crisis has passed." He also said that he believes that at the beginning of the European war, Britain was unprepared in Europe, but "we are now preparing here to prevent the scourge of aggression. If we had prepared in 1939, there would not have been aggression in Europe." Accompanying Mr. Aras was his wife, Lady Diana Aras. They will return to Singapore on Sunday to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Mr. Clark Kerr, who is traveling from Chongqing to Singapore.</p>
<p>United Press, Simla, 20th. It was learned here yesterday that the international trade management issues discussed in the important meeting in Singapore, especially focusing on economic warfare. The meeting began last week, and representatives of the British Empire are holding talks with former British Minister of Information, Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras’s Correct Remarks</h3>
<p>Mr. Tevfik Rüştü Aras, the British special envoy to the Far East, is currently visiting the Dutch East Indies and plans to visit Australia before returning to Singapore to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Mr. Clark Kerr. Undoubtedly, amidst the intermittent U.S.-Japan talks, Mr. Aras, based on his original mission, is intensifying the close cooperation of the ABCD group in the Far East. His statements can, of course, somewhat represent the common intentions of this group. Before leaving Singapore, he made a statement to American reporters, emphasizing: "I am deeply confident that Washington, in any negotiations with Tokyo, will absolutely respect Chinese interests." After arriving in Batavia, he spoke twice more, first saying, "The current tranquility in the Far East is definitely not due to the United States sacrificing China to negotiate with Japan," and then, "The situation is currently in a dormant state, but it cannot be readily assumed that the crisis has passed." He also implied that if the Dutch East Indies is attacked, the British army in Singapore may immediately be dispatched to assist.</p>
<p>From these two short statements, at least two points can be seen: first, Britain and the United States will absolutely not betray China; and second, although exploratory talks are taking place between the United States and Japan, the vigilance and cooperation of the democratic front in the Far East have absolutely not been relaxed as a result. If anyone, because of the failure of the U.S.-Japan talks, hastily believes that the overall situation in the Far East can now be worry-free, that would be the same mistake as mistakenly thinking that President Roosevelt intended to sacrifice China to appease Japan because the United States attempted to suppress Japan through negotiations. While a spokesman for the Japanese army declared, "Regardless of any opposition, we are determined to proceed with the war against China and obtain raw materials from the Dutch East Indies," Mr. Aras has made clear statements that the crisis has not passed and that the British army is determined to assist the Dutch East Indies. Although this may be a coincidental coincidence, it is not without a sense of confrontation and unwillingness to show weakness.</p>
<p>Originally, we have long said that Japan's talks with the United States are not sincerely seeking reconciliation or thoroughly repenting its misdeeds. In reality, it is only because both objective circumstances and internal conditions are temporarily unfavorable to carrying out new adventurous actions, and the economic sanctions imposed by Britain and the United States are indeed sufficient to isolate Japan to death. Therefore, it is happy to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is preparing to free up its forces to deal with the situation in Europe to hold talks with Washington in order to delay the time and slightly relieve the suffering of economic suffocation. However, regardless of whether negotiations have reached an agreement or are still in progress, if any unexpected changes occur in the international situation, allowing Japan to once again have an opportunity to take advantage of, then anyone who dares to assert that Tokyo's radicals will definitely make a comeback, reverting to their old ways. All promises, guarantees, and even all agreements will be equal to waste paper. Precisely because of this reason, we have always believed that President Roosevelt's U.S.-Japan talks, if not for other purposes, or similarly intending to delay the time in order to complete the necessary preparations in all aspects, especially in the Far East defense, before actually using force, then it seems that he is making an unnecessary move.</p>
<p>Judging from Mr. Aras's tireless efforts and the fact that the Chinese army has not yet launched a general counteroffensive, it can be seen that although the entire front of the ABCD group in the Far East has been established, the specific methods for each item related to technology, especially the issue of military supply and military cooperation, seem to still have room for active enrichment and adjustment. Therefore, the interpretation mentioned above that President Roosevelt's talks with Japan are intended to take the opportunity to complete the necessary preparations may not be without reason. From China's perspective, the most terrifying thing is that the United States engages in negotiations with Japan while neglecting to support the democratic group in the Far East. However, the facts now prove that this is absolutely not the case. Not only has President Roosevelt expressed his intention to step up aid to China in the implementation report of the Lend-Lease Act, but also the fact that he has sent a military delegation of as many as forty people to China and that the Dutch East Indies has 2,500 excellent warplanes, mostly from the United States, as Mr. Aras mentioned yesterday, is enough to prove that the United States' anti-aggression policy and its determination to defend the integrity of the Far East have absolutely not changed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we believe that the most important point is that the democratic front itself, including China, must not neglect the necessary vigilance or relax the necessary arrangements due to some recent so-called "truce" atmosphere. Based on the above-mentioned reasons that Japan cannot be trusted to abide by any constraints, regardless of whether the U.S.-Japan negotiations will be successful, the source of trouble in the Far East has not been fundamentally eradicated. Therefore, it must not be mistakenly believed that the crisis has disappeared. Mr. Aras's statement yesterday is a crucial warning to every democratic force in the Far East.</p>
<p>Japan Closely Watches the Development of the European War</p>
<p>East Reports Government's Cautious Diplomacy</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th. The "Chugai Commercial News" predicts that if Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa fall in succession before winter arrives, the German-Soviet war situation can be decided. The United Kingdom and the United States have no ability to assist the Soviet Union in preventing the advance of the German army. Soon, the Soviet Union will change its war policy.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 19th. The Japanese "Guangzhi Shimbun" recently published an editorial advising the government not to lightly disclose the current stage of negotiations between Japan and the United States, stating that during negotiations between the two governments, there are often stages involving larger goals. The government can weigh the pros and cons and publicly disclose these goals to the people in order to gain their support or prevent opposition actions. Especially at present, the international situation is intricate and subtle. Those who practice diplomacy may inadvertently fall into danger. Therefore, the people should place complete trust in the highest authorities and their responsible advisors and should not act rashly. It should be understood that diplomatic negotiations are like commercial negotiations, with every ounce being contested. Government personnel should act alone without public interference. Otherwise, if they succeed, they will gain trust and thus retain their positions. If they unfortunately fail, they will only have to retire, which is not a good policy.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan Negotiations are in Progress. President Roosevelt Did Not Disclose the Nature of the Talks When Receiving Reporters</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th. Yesterday, when President Roosevelt received reporters from various newspapers, he refused to discuss the nature of his talks with Japanese Ambassador Nomura, saying that there was no new news regarding Japanese issues or the Far East situation in the past 24 hours. President Roosevelt also stated that his talks with Secretary of State Hull on Friday did not involve Far Eastern issues and that he meets or speaks with the Secretary of State from time to time to discuss all international developments.</p>
<p>China Has Undergone Four Years of Bloodshed, and National Consciousness Has Become More Resilient</p>
<p>U.S. Sanctions Against Japan Must Not Be Relaxed. Ambassador Hu Shih Delivers a Speech in the United States</p>
<p>Hafner Agency, Cincinnati, 20th. Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, said in a speech at the Annual Meeting of the Life Insurance Association of America: "The economic embargo imposed by the United States has begun to show a significant impact on the national life and military arrogance of Japan. I deeply believe that once the American people have fully recognized the astonishing effectiveness of this economic weapon, they will not relax or abandon it in the slightest until this measure successfully awakens the Japanese military and the Japanese people to the clear lesson that aggression does not pay and that war is suicide." When discussing the Sino-Japanese war, Ambassador Hu said, "We still have vast land and unlimited manpower. Our unified national historical consciousness has undergone a new baptism of fire and blood, and it is stronger and more unyielding than before. Japan's political isolation and spiritual rejection have long been completed due to its own actions, and the suffocating economic encirclement of Japan is also being completed."</p>
<h3>General Pownall Arrives in Burma to Inspect Defenses</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 20th. General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, who is currently inspecting Burma's defenses and other defenses, departed this evening for Tongoo, Southern Shan State, and Lashio, the starting point of the Burma Road. Before departing, General Pownall viewed a stunning performance by the latest rapid combat aircraft. He will travel by plane to various places for inspection, but several hundred miles must be traveled by car. He will return here after several days of inspection. Lieutenant General Macleod, Commander of the British Forces in Burma, is accompanying him.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 20th. A Japanese man named Hidaka was sentenced to one year in prison today on charges of possessing and copying seditious texts. Another Japanese man charged with distributing this text was released.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Ukraine. Germany Claims to Have Occupied Kiev. Moscow and London Have Not Yet Confirmed. Soviet Troops Resist Strongly, Fighting for Every Inch of Land</h3>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 20th. The German High Command issued a special communique yesterday stating that after breaking through the strong fortifications on the west bank of the Dnieper River, German troops entered Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th. Although Germany has officially announced that it has entered Kiev, the Soviet communique issued at noon did not announce any changes in the situation there, only stating that the fighting in the Ukrainian capital region was extremely fierce. London has also not confirmed the fall of Kiev, believing that German propaganda cannot be trusted. The Soviet Command may have decided to leave powerful troops in prominent locations to implement its planned strategy. There is also no news of continued progress by German forces in the Murmansk region. The Soviet army's mouthpiece, Red Star, said that in recent attacks approaching Kiev, Germany lost ten divisions, hundreds of tanks, and hundreds of aircraft. Even if Kiev is indeed occupied by German forces, it will deal a heavy blow to the Soviet Union, but Germany has also suffered heavy losses after fighting around it for many days. The loss of Kiev is not yet considered extremely important. If the German army advances further east, the Soviet Union's war industry will face a greater threat.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 19th. It is admitted here that the situation in Kiev is serious, but the soldiers and civilians defending the city have not yet given up their determination to fight for every inch of land. During the offensive in the first half of August, German troops once reached the outskirts of Kiev at the cost of 20,000 soldiers being buried in the battlefield and a large number of war machines being destroyed, but were eventually forced to retreat due to the strong resistance of the defenders. Now, disregarding unprecedented losses, they have once again attacked a certain part of the Kiev defense line.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Hafner Agency, Headquarters of the Führer, 20th. This afternoon, the German war report stated that German infantry, after days of arduous fighting, and with the assistance of the Air Force, broke through the strong defensive works of the Soviet army in Kiev. Yesterday, German troops ventured to break through the city of Kiev and hoisted the German flag high above the citadel. After the Soviet commander fled Kiev, the Soviet troops defending the city surrendered and laid down their arms. German troops had already occupied the city of Poltava the day before yesterday. As a result of the joint offensive by German ground, naval and air forces in mid-September, they occupied Moon Island and Worm Island, not far from the Gulf of Riga. Last night, German aircraft bombed Odessa and Moscow.</p>
<p>Hafner Agency, Berlin, 20th. The first news of the German occupation of Kiev to reach Berlin was a telephone report from war correspondent Senck, who said: "We crossed the small river into Kiev fully armed at midnight. We were shivering with cold on the riverbank, but our teeth did not chatter. When we climbed to the defense line, we were ordered to attack. Hand grenades and flame throwers were used together. After the first defensive work was captured, we learned that we would encounter the secret police team. We proceeded step by step, and by dusk, Kiev was completely in our hands. The city's ammunition depots were first bombed by aircraft and then bombarded with the largest caliber artillery."</p>
<h3>British Delegation Departs for Moscow. Large Quantities of War Equipment are Shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th. Lord Beaverbrook, Minister Without Portfolio, who is leading the British delegation to Moscow, has now departed for. Before leaving, he said that British industry has stepped up production to fully support the Soviet Union and will build an unprecedented number of tanks.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th. Averell Harriman, the leader of the U.S. delegation attending the Moscow Conference, held a reception for reporters here today. According to his remarks, various supplies are now being shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union, and the quantity will increase daily. The Soviet Union will soon have a large number of American-made aircraft and tanks. Harriman also said that his mission is entirely technical and that he will have interesting talks with the United Kingdom to jointly analyze the entire issue of providing supplies to aid the Soviet Union. This task is extremely important, and it has now been proven that both the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have determination and pay attention to it. Several American technicians will also travel to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Mission Leaves the United States to Return Home, Via Alaska</h3>
<p>Reuters, Seattle, 20th. Two Soviet flying boats, which carried a Soviet military delegation to the United States two weeks ago, flew back to the Soviet Union via Alaska last night.</p>
<h3>Twelve British Warships Under Repair in the United States</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th. Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that twelve British warships are currently under repair in American seaports, including one battleship, two aircraft carriers, five cruisers, one submarine, two gunboats, and one minesweeper. The battleship is the HMS Warspite, which has passed through the Far Eastern waters, leading Japan to say that the ship led a naval fleet to Thailand. It is currently being repaired at Bremerton.

<p>German Troops Continue to Advance Adventurously to the East; Four Soviet Armies Are Surrounded</p>
<p>United Press, London, 20th. British military experts here believe that some Soviet armies in Kiev have been surrounded by German troops and are in danger of being annihilated. The troops of General von Rundstedt of the German army are tightening their pressure on Crimea and advancing towards the Kharkov and Donets industrial areas. However, British military experts also believe that these surrounded Soviet troops may be able to break through the encirclement, as in Minsk. Some even believe that the troops of General von Rundstedt, who encircled the Soviet troops east of Kiev, may soon be counter-encircled by the Soviet troops.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 19th. After German troops crossed the Dnieper River at Kremenchug, they continued to advance to the northeast and have occupied the city of Poltava (90 miles southwest of Kharkov and 300 miles southeast of Kiev).</p>
<p>Kiev is the Second Largest City in the Soviet Union and Occupies an Important Position in History</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 19th</p>
<p>Military figures here attach great importance to the German occupation of Kiev, believing that this will have a significant impact on the Soviet Union and the entire Slavic world. Kiev is the capital of the Ukrainian Republic and is very important in Russian history. It is also the cultural center of the South Slavic people in Eastern Europe and the second largest city in the Soviet Union, second only to Moscow. For this reason, the German occupation of Kiev is politically important. According to historical records, Kiev has always been a base for separatist activities. For example, the German-backed Ukrainian autonomous government in 1918 was in that city for eighteen months. In addition, it is the same economically. The Ukrainian state is known as the "breadbasket of Europe," and the wheat produced is exported through Kiev.</p>
<h3>German Raider in the Pacific Said to Be Sunk; Location West of Panama Canal; Washington Claims No Intelligence Received</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th – It was rumored here yesterday that "after sinking several other merchant ships in the South Pacific, a German raider has been sunk." This news originated from London but has not been confirmed. Further details are currently unavailable. According to London, the raider was sunk west of the Panama Canal. Panama and Batavia reported last week that a Dutch cargo ship en route from the Dutch East Indies to the canal was overdue and feared lost, possibly sunk by the raider. The London report did not mention the nationality of the ship that sank the raider. During yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt declined to comment on London's claim that Britain had sunk a Nazi raider.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th – The Navy Department stated yesterday that it has not received intelligence regarding the rumor that a German raider was sunk in the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Soviet Night Hawks Bomb Berlin; British Planes Attack Northern German Targets</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – Although the German official news agency stated that British planes attacked Berlin last night, according to London sources, the British Air Force did not attack Berlin while bombing northwestern Germany. It appears that Soviet planes bombed the German capital. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that British bombers attacked dockyards, warehouses, and railway yards at Stettin, Germany's largest Baltic port, last night. Two British planes are missing. Coastal Command aircraft also bombed targets near Nantes last night, and all British planes returned safely to base. Stettin is an important supply base for German forces on the Eastern Front. The British Air Force heavily bombed the area last October, with the Politz synthetic gasoline plant as the main target. British planes must fly 600 miles to raid the area.</p>

<h3>Second Three-Year Plan Being Implemented; Actively Developing Resources; Transportation Industry to See Rapid Development; Output of Iron, Coal, and Cement Can All Be Increased</h3>
<p>Chongqing – News from here yesterday stated that Xinjiang, China's largest and least populated province, is currently implementing its second three-year plan, actively developing its natural resources. Under the rule of pro-Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai, Xinjiang began its first three-year plan in 1937, the year the Sino-Japanese War began. Its second three-year plan began last year, coinciding with the Soviet Union's three-year plan. Achievements of the first three-year plan include the construction of 22 canals, the dredging of nine rivers, and the construction of two major reservoirs, using irrigation to reclaim 30,000 acres of wasteland. Official sources here state that after the first year of the plan concluded, 30 vehicles operated on the province's new and old highways. In the second year, another 360 drivers were trained, and 700 more transport vehicles were added, increasing transport to 4.5 million tons. When the first three-year plan was completed, 15 wireless radio stations were established, and a 700-mile long-distance telephone line was installed. In Urumqi alone, 1,000 telephones have been installed. Xinjiang's fuel oil can also be self-sufficient, with annual coal production increasing to 350,000 tons, cement production increasing to 20,000 tons per year, and iron ore production increasing to 10,000 tons per year. Undeveloped resources include gold mines near Tacheng on the border, jade in Yutian, and copper in Kuqa. In the past four years, 42 light industrial factories have been established to manufacture matches, flour, textiles, and wool products. The center of Xinjiang's light industry is Yili, where there is a university, 15 middle schools, 300 primary schools, and 122 public education centers. In addition, there are 1,000 private schools, with a total of 200,000 students in primary and secondary schools. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (8) (2) The Structure of the Stalin Line</h3>
<p>This is also a report from the New York Times:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's defense system is indeed unique. The "Stalin Line," now world-renowned, is a decentralized version of the French "Maginot Line," becoming the latest type of modern defensive fortification. The designer was Marshal Tukhachevsky, the most famous military strategist in Soviet Russia, who was unfortunately sacrificed in the 1937 purge.</p>
<p>Many units in this type of defensive fortification are circular, resembling wheel spokes. The Russians call them "pillboxes." Although their shapes vary, their layouts are all designed to allow shooting in all directions. One company or more often forms a triangle. Their sizes vary; some can accommodate a company, while others can accommodate a battalion. However, how these "three pillboxes" are coordinated and where troops are stationed is inconsistent. Some are independent, while others are closely connected. The purpose of connecting is to allow mutual support. Some "pillboxes," especially the larger ones, are easy to see, making it easy to lure the enemy to attack. However, once the enemy attacks, it easily falls into the fire net of many hidden "pillboxes." These hidden "pillboxes" are often disguised with mud and grass (Russians are known for their excellent camouflage), numbering in the thousands. Most "pillboxes" have tank sheds and store large quantities of gasoline, making them front-line fueling stations. If they feel difficult to defend for long, they can be blown up at any time. The amount of gasoline stored in the "pillboxes" is said to be considerable. The gasoline normally used in Soviet villages is concentrated on collective farms. In times of crisis, they transport this gasoline to specially built oil depots inside the "pillboxes," preventing even a drop from falling into the enemy's hands.</p>
<p>Many larger "pillboxes," especially those on the outskirts of major cities, are equipped with anti-aircraft guns that can be fired from the gun ports. Depending on their size, these "pillboxes" are also equipped with various calibers of cannons, placed in special gun positions, separated from the main body, and protected by machine guns and flamethrowers. "Pillboxes" have trenches leading outside, allowing the defenders to retreat to nearby forests.</p>
<p>These trenches are six feet deep and have no cover. The bottom and sides are supported by wooden blocks and special barbed wire to make them strong. When the defenders withdraw, local farmers drive disguised tractors to transport the cannons. The word "encircled" in German war reports often refers to the encirclement of these "pillboxes."</p>
<p>Although the "pillboxes" and trenches are simple in construction, the fortifications are extremely strong, built with the most refined steel plate and cement. They are fully equipped with electric lights and running water. The supply of running water is crucial in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The tactical role of this type of fortification is very clear, truly "absorbing the enemy like a sponge," as Soviet officers say. The Red Army uses this strategy to disconnect large enemy units, making it impossible for them to achieve their intended results. The tank vanguard responsible for breaking through the defense line is instead cut off. If they turn to attack those "pillboxes," the effectiveness of the blitzkrieg is destroyed. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the German war reports stating that their vanguard has entered enemy positions are actually effective.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this decentralized defensive fortification is to disperse the enemy's main offensive, forcing them to fight individually, and to isolate their vanguard. The Red Army uses this defense method, borrowing the operational secrets commonly used by the German General Staff, and persevering with them, ultimately preventing the German army from progressing. In other words, the Soviet defense strategy relies on the large number of their own manpower to extend the front line to disperse the enemy's forces. During the last European War, the German army launched a pincer offensive against the Imperial Russian army, capturing a large number of prisoners. However, in this war, the German army only obtained the same number of prisoners in the Polish area occupied by the Red Army, where these "pillboxes" were not built. A recent German war report stated that the Soviet Union put out sixty "arms" to deal with the German army. This bizarre military intelligence report clearly refers to the "pillbox" defenses. To date, the Soviet Union has been able to use this advantage in manpower to defend thousands of pillboxes on the one hand, while still having enough strength to form mobile units to meet the enemy at any time and in any place. They are also able to retreat slowly, avoiding large-scale mobile warfare, and luring the enemy into predetermined defensive lines to annihilate them, so that the attackers' losses are greater than the Red Army's losses when fighting and retreating. One advantage of the Red Army's "pillbox" defensive fortifications is that the enemy cannot predict the extent of man-made obstacles. Under these circumstances, forcibly crossing rivers, occupying hills, or seizing railway hubs becomes less important. In other words, the importance of natural obstacles is reduced by man-made obstacles. These man-made obstacles are no less important than fortresses. The reason why the German army has repeatedly failed to conquer Leningrad is precisely because of this.</p>
<p>The outside world knows little about this type of Soviet defensive fortification; even fragments of information have not been leaked out. However, the German General Staff, claiming to have mastered the inside story of the "Stalin Line," may have underestimated the strategic value of this defense line. (The End)</p>

<h3>International Radio Station to Broadcast Northwest Observation Team's Solar Eclipse Report; Time from 8:00 AM, Wavelength 25 Meters; Fujian and Shaanxi Observation Teams Have Departed for Their Destinations</h3>
<p>Chongqing – On the 21st, during the solar eclipse, the International Radio Station will broadcast the spectacle of the solar eclipse from the Lintao Northwest Solar Eclipse Observation Team via the Ministry of Communications' Xianzhou Radio Station to allow listeners across the region who are unable to witness the solar eclipse to enjoy it. Scientists around the world are exploring the principles of the impact of solar eclipses on radio wave emissions. For this solar eclipse, in addition to station director Mr. Ma Dan personally going to the Northwest to observe and study the relationship between the solar eclipse and radio waves, the British Broadcasting Corporation and RCA in the United States have been contacted to test whether they can receive the station's broadcast and break through the interference of the solar eclipse. It is reported that the station's solar eclipse program will be broadcast from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM tomorrow, using a 25-meter omnidirectional wavelength. (20th)</p>
<p>Yongan – The total solar eclipse on the 21st will enter China from Soviet Central Asia, passing through Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, covering 112 counties and cities, a distance of 4,000 kilometers, lasting 85 minutes. The longest duration will be 3 minutes and 21 seconds in Chong'an, northern Fujian. The total eclipse zone includes 14 counties and cities, including Xining, Lintao, Tianshui, Fengxian, Qianjiang, Zhongxiang, Wuchang, Hankou, Nanchang, Shangrao, Chong'an, and Qingyuan. The last total solar eclipse visible in China was on July of the year Ji You in the Ming Jiajing Dynasty, which is August 21, 1542. The total eclipse zone was limited to the Yellow River basin. This time, in addition to the Yellow River basin, the Yangtze River basin is also included. Moreover, in China, even in places not within the total eclipse zone, the amount of the sun covered will be mostly 50% or more, truly a rare opportunity. The Fujian team organized by the China Solar Eclipse Observation Committee, with more than 60 experts, has departed from Yongan to Chong'an to work. (19th)</p>
<p>Baoji – The Shaanxi Provincial Solar Eclipse Observation Team, a group of more than 50 people led by Wang Jiesan, arrived in Baoji on the 19th and decided to go to Huangniupu on the 20th to conduct observations. (19th)</p>
<p>Mount Wuyi – In the past 399 years, there have been only two total solar eclipses visible in our country. One was on August 11, 1546, and the other was on July of the year Ji You in the Ming Jiajing Dynasty, when the solar eclipse passed through the Yellow River basin. The other one is the one on September 21 this year. It will start on the east coast of the Black Sea in the forenoon, pass through Central Asia and enter Xinjiang, traverse from northwest to southeast, and diagonally cross the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, including the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, before entering the Pacific Ocean. The width of the total eclipse zone averages 140 kilometers, and the duration is 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The entire journey in our country is about 3,500 kilometers long, lasting 80 minutes. Academic groups, astronomical observatories, and other institutions in the country cherish this once-in-a-millennium opportunity and have organized observation teams to conduct observations in Gansu and Fujian provinces. The focus of observation will be placed on Mount Wuyi in the east. Mount Wuyi is one of China's famous mountains, where the Song Dynasty Confucian Zhu Xi lectured. It is known for its tea production. It is located in Chong'an County on the northern border of Fujian Province and is the best observation location in the southeast this time. The Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau organized an observation committee half a year ago to prepare and sent personnel to Chongqing to liaise with relevant central agencies and national universities in advance. Currently, there are more than 30 units from academic groups and institutions participating in the observation from within and outside the province, including the Chinese Astronomical Society, the Bureau of Land Surveying, the Astronomical Observatory, the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Zhongshan University, Xiamen University, Zhejiang University, the Fuzhou branch of the Central News Agency, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, the Audiovisual Education Office, and the Provincial Radio Station. Among them, there are five main observation teams with more than 60 experts, each carrying and transporting instruments and taking on more than 20 tasks, including (the beginning and end times of the solar eclipse), (solar eclipse photography), (changes in the high-altitude electron layer), (geomagnetic changes), and (telegraph changes). Hundreds of spectators have come from afar from Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other places. This grand event on a famous mountain is unprecedented and will surely contribute to astronomy in our country. (20th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Burmese Immigration Negotiations Have Begun</h3>
<p>Rangoon – When Sino-Burmese negotiations on the issue of Chinese immigrants to Burma began yesterday, the chief Chinese representative Hui Rongfu was absent due to illness. His opening speech was read by another person, emphasizing the mutually interdependent relationship between China and Burma and stating that China and Burma are on the side of the democratic front. The recent remarks by British Prime Minister Churchill have indicated his awareness that Japan's southward advance in the Pacific is a real danger. Today's negotiations are another demonstration of cooperation between China and Burma. The Burmese Prime Minister rose to speak, saying that although Burma's proposals seek to limit the entry of new Chinese immigrants, there is absolutely no intention to impose unfair or insulting conditions on Chinese immigrants. Burma also intends to treat Chinese people already in Burma generously. Burma has benefited greatly from Chinese immigrants in the past, and it is necessary to maintain harmony between China and Burma at any cost. The best way to achieve this goal is to implement mutually agreed restrictions on Chinese immigrants, thereby dispelling the natural fears of the Burmese people. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Mu Ouchu Returns to Kunming from Burma</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance: Reorganizing Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The reorganization of salt taxes has been under discussion for a long time. The authorities, considering that salt will soon be a government monopoly, do not wish to make many changes. Therefore, they are only adopting a system of ad valorem taxation. All regular and additional taxes other than production and sales taxes, such as construction special funds, additional tax reorganization fees, and public welfare fees, will be abolished. Hereafter, production taxes will be collected at the production site, and sales taxes will be levied on the cost of salt at a rate of 10% when it arrives at the sales location, with absolutely no double taxation. The tax for industrial salt remains at one yuan per dan (unit of weight). The new method will be implemented this month. The average monthly revenue is expected to be 50 million yuan, doubling the previous amount. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Wang and Xu Win the Right to the Finals in the Grass Court Tennis All-Grades Singles - Wang Wenzheng Eliminates Tang Baojia in Straight Sets - Xu Chengwei Wins Li Guofan After a Hard-Fought Five-Set Match</h3>
<p>In this year's Grass Court Senior Singles semi-finals, the four knights of the Chinese tennis world, Wang Wenzheng, Xu Chengwei, Li Guofan, and Tang Xianjia, met at the Association's tennis court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to compete for the right to the finals. Given the miracle of a Chinese takeover, the number of spectators reached thousands, with domestic fans accounting for the vast majority, creating an unprecedented scene. As a result of the semi-finals, Wang Wenzheng eliminated Tang Baojia in straight sets, while Xu Chengwei eliminated Li Guofan after a hard-fought five-set match, turning defeat into victory. The match between Xu and Li was full of surprises and was quite exciting. Wang and Xu will meet in the finals at a later date. The results of yesterday's semi-finals are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Sets of Performances</p>
<p>In the match between Wang and Tang, Tang Baojia had little power to resist under the one-sided situation. Regardless of smashes or volleys, Wang Wenzheng could move at will. If Wang had not shown mercy, Tang would have been completely defeated. Xu Chengwei and Li Guofan both arrived late and did not start until 4:30 PM. The strength of the two was almost indistinguishable, and the victory or defeat depended on luck. In terms of technique, Li Guofan seemed to be slightly better, but it was a pity that he suffered defeat due to chaos and instability in a winnable situation. After a hard-fought battle that lasted two hours, both were exhausted. Xu's serve was not as good as Li's, but his backhand was Xu's masterpiece, showing the style of his older brother Xu Chengji. His diagonal draws with both forehands and backhands were also wonderfully executed, but his ball-striking skills were still immature. Li Guofan's serve had the style of Lin Baohua, powerful and deep into the corner. It was a pity that Li lost many points on his serve, resulting in a reversal of fortune.</p>
<p>Highlights of the Fierce Battle In the match between Wang and Tang, Wang completed five games in one breath in the first set, and Tang only won one game before Wang easily won with a score of six to one. In the second set, Wang still took the lead with five consecutive games, then released one game, and won again with a score of six to one. In the third set, Tang broke Wang Wenzheng's serve and won the first game, but then suffered a major setback, losing six consecutive games. The score was again six to one. In summary, Wang won in straight sets. Following this, Xu and Li fought. Li Guofan showed maturity and physical strength, both with the upper hand. It was a pity that Li had a two-to-one lead, and in the fourth set, he trailed by one to five, and caught up to five to five, but he failed to achieve complete success in the end. Xu then made it seven to five, tying the score at two sets each, which was a pity. In the fifth and final set, the linesman misjudged a good ball as out of bounds, losing the game point. Otherwise, it would have been five-all, so victory or defeat was really a matter of luck. Li Guofan completely dominated in the first, second, and third sets. In the fourth set, the situation relaxed, and Xu took the lead with a score of five to one. Although Li chased and tied it to five each, it was a pity that he could not achieve complete success. In the final decisive set, after Li led by three to two, Xu won three consecutive games, and won by six to four.</p>

<h3>Cai Guoheng and Averig Will Compete - Junior Singles Champion - Parker Cup Doubles Final Cancelled</h3>
<p>The International Parker Cup Doubles Tournament, originally scheduled to decide this year's champion at the Association's court this afternoon, was canceled due to the French Municipal Council Police Department's ban on competitions in the French Concession. The final of the Men's Junior Singles Championship was also decided to be postponed. The semi-finals of this tournament were held a few days ago. Up-and-coming player Cai Guoheng defeated Auguste in straight sets, and Kuang Tianhan lost to Averig by three to one. The final between Cai Guoheng and Averig is expected to be a one-sided situation, as Cai is actually a Group A player, only slightly less experienced than Li Guofan and Tang Baojia. Averig, on the other hand, is a second-rate player from French business, with mediocre strength. The results of the Junior Singles and Men's Doubles are recorded as follows. The All-Shanghai Xiangqi Charity Tournament opens today.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Flowers - All Because of the Influx of Hot Money - Cotton Yarn Buying is Booming</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be good, and the price increases are ongoing. At the same time, the sales of spot yarn have improved significantly. The Hong Kong merchants have a slightly stronger demand for the 20-count medium and low-grade yarns, buying about 300 bales. There is no appetite for other 32-count and 42-count yarns. Therefore, people's sentiment is good, and the bulls are further adding to the momentum. However, because there are very few factory orders, the market is not very prosperous. However, some people are bullish because of raw materials and expect prices to rise. However, if prices rise, there will be no shortage of short sellers. In this regard, the lineup of both bulls and bears is quite solid. The highest price for Double Horse 20-count yarn was 1,758 yuan, the lowest price was 1,745 yuan, and the closing price was 1,713 yuan. However, after the market closed, rumors suddenly came about, and sellers gathered, saying that it was doing at 1,745 or 1,746 yuan. The current situation in the yarn market looks good in terms of common sense, but judging from past trends, it is often the opposite.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the upward momentum from the previous day, with the first lot priced at 1,750 yuan. As soon as this lot opened, the atmosphere on the trading floor was lively, and buying was booming. The so-called "table top" caused a scramble to enter, and it soon rose to 1,757 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that the Exchange opened high, and the second lot was soft, and people's sentiment eased slightly, falling to 1,746 yuan. However, the spot yarn purchases by Guangdong merchants were not weak, and it rose again to 1,758 yuan. Subsequently, a slightly larger amount of large households released, and the market was slightly soft, and it was tired to 1,753 yuan at the close. According to statistics, 8,840 bales were traded in half a day. On the 21st, 280 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 300 South Seas 40</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 8,500 Total 8,840</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market is slowly soaring, and the ground is relatively stable. Although US cotton continues to decline strongly, and general buyers are quite willing to absorb it in this dull atmosphere, and are not willing to wait for a long time, coupled with the influx of hot money. Furthermore, it is said that the sales of spot yarn have not moved, so factory orders are firm as soon as they open. Furthermore, due to the influence of large households, the market is standing firm. The human sentiment of the future yarn should be glowing, especially since the trading this month is about to be delivered. With the multi-party pull, the short sellers have to buy back, so the market price rises. The September contract opened at a high price of 1,668 yuan, the October contract opened at 1,674 yuan, and the November contract opened at 1,683 yuan. The initial opening transaction was circuitous and varied. In the middle, the Exchange was firm and then soft again. The recent meeting rolled slightly to 1,664 yuan, the October contract fell to 1,669 yuan, and the November contract also fell to 1,681 yuan. Until the close, the bulls came to purchase again, so the prices went up two to four yuan. As a result, the recent contract closed at 1,668 yuan, rising six yuan, the October contract was 1,672 yuan, also rising four yuan, and the November contract was at 1,682 yuan, rising two yuan. The transaction price list is listed below:</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Continues to Fall - Spot Cotton Buyers Lack Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is slightly mediocre, and the trading is not as enthusiastic as the previous day. This is because the foreign cotton is falling rapidly, and the yarn market has no big hopes. Although the speculative mentality is to always look up, the real spot buyers lack enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to negative news from the Soviet Union and weakness in New Orleans. Then, it rebounded slightly due to short covering. Yesterday's closing price was about 27 or 28 points lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to cotton merchants selling a large number of long positions. However, it rose slightly later due to some profit-taking buying. Yesterday's closing prices fell by about four rupees. It is also predicted that the opening market today will continue to be small by 2.75 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading is undoubtedly because overseas direct cotton setting, there is no development at present. All parties can only recruit for spot cotton.</p>
<h3>Finance - Cash Fluctuates Without Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was dismal. The October contract delivery trading opened at one hundred and several tens of taels. The market trend turned from strong to weak. It went out and in the 6,900 yuan level, only 15 yuan high and low, and finally rolled slightly for five yuan. Cash, on the other hand, was fluctuating uncertainly, first rising and then returning. A certain bank once again supplied purchases, and the securities brokers tried their best to sell, causing it to break through 9,100 yuan and then immediately return. From the morning opening, the price was the same as the last price of the previous day. The gold shops did each other 20 taels, at 9,070 yuan. A certain bank received the money, and Xianghe entered a small money shop for 30 taels, rising to 9,080 yuan. Suddenly, Taikangrun, Yongfengyu and other cash shops started to spit out, slightly seeing the market falling. A Shanghai west merchant entered a certain cash shop for 20 taels at 9,065 yuan. Unexpectedly, Xianghe supplied more bravely, and after raising it to 9,100 yuan, there were fewer sellers, and the price continued to rise to 9,160 yuan. At the beginning, Defu supplied ten taels, followed by continuous sales. At that time, the enterers were waiting and watching, so it was also shouted down to within 9,100 yuan. A bill merchant sold ten taels to a gold shop for 9,080 yuan. Suddenly, the bank helped to do 20 taels with each other and raised it to 9,100 yuan. In the end, Defu shouted 9,090 yuan for sale, and at that time, there were few responders. The price was 20 yuan higher than the previous day's closing. There was a high and low of 95 yuan. The number of transactions was five hundred and several tens of taels. The retail price of the cash shop's main brand gold was 9,150 yuan. The purchase price was 200 yuan lower than the selling price. Jewelry gold first rose by ten yuan, and then returned to the same level.</p>

<h3>Chongqing and Shanghai Compare Term Deposits - Facilitates the Transfer of Hot Money</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Gang banks in this city have recently handled Chongqing-compared term deposits, with no restrictions on the number of deposits, but each household must have at least 1,000 yuan of Chongqing currency, and the term is specified for half a month, with the middle and end of each month as the deposit and withdrawal dates. If you want to deposit before the term, it can also be accommodated, but it must still be interest-bearing from the middle or end of the month, so that Chongqing can deposit and withdraw. Deposit interest rates are based on the Chongqing comparison interest rate for each period, and are set once every half month (the previous period this year was around 2 points per month), and the deposits are calculated in Chongqing's general national currency. Shanghai deposits are converted according to the exchange rate from Shanghai to Chongqing on that day (for example, if you deposit more than 700 yuan of national currency in Shanghai now, you can get 1,000 yuan of Chongqing national currency). If you want to withdraw part or all of the principal and interest on the due date, it will be converted into Shanghai currency according to the exchange rate from Chongqing to Shanghai on that day. If you want to withdraw it in Chongqing or a city other than Chongqing, you can also open a draft.</p>
<h3>Securities - Domestic Debt Slightly Down</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was done in the morning. It started at eleven o'clock. Category C was first opened at 72.2 corners, but for a time, the selling was extremely active, breaking two yuan and seeing a low price of 1.6 corners. The reason was that there was also an issue of 120 million military public bonds, and the bulls were discouraged and the front line was broken through. The environment has also become a negative one, but the bulls may not be willing to stop immediately. Yesterday, Kai Panji Ji Lianyi 90% Yitai bought in, while the sellers like Renfeng Dazhong Dahua Xinfeng Huachang bravely sold, which made the market go down in a straight line. Although Runde Sheng Dahong Daxinfu still had needs, and Le Mao still had a large number of sales, Ding Kang Shuntai Lianhe also had a steady supply, which caused the close to only Category C and E to slightly recover, and all other types were still tired and unable to rise. As a result, the market price uniformly returned to small four corners and a half to seven corners. The total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Grain Prices: Foreign Rice Initially Rises, Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then fell. The final result was a slight drop, nearing one yuan. This was because the morning market inherited the bullish trend from the previous night, and everyone expected prices to continue rising. Indeed, retail sales were strong, especially for weekend purchases. Furthermore, buyers from Hangzhou and other inland Zhejiang areas came to the market to purchase broken rice and various grades of rice from Zhongguan. Market sentiment was extremely strong, and the prices of all types of rice rose uniformly. Xiaowen current rice reached 107 yuan, Saigon No. 1 reached 119 yuan, No. 2 reached 110 yuan, and other types of rice all rose in unison. The Xiaojiao Yinhua Company also opened at 134.5 yuan, an increase of more than one yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. However, after the rise, there was profit-taking, and due to unfavorable rumors, retail investors actively sold at the high prices, causing the market to fall sharply. Bank godowns and Xiaojiao immediately fell from 106.5 yuan to 105.5 yuan, and Yinhua Company also fell by half a yuan, with other types of rice following suit. As a result, prices fell by about one yuan compared to the previous night. Transaction volume still reached 14,000 to 15,000 bags, with Yinhua Company trading 300 to 400 tons.</p>
<p>The market for thick and thin japonica domestic rice has a limited daily supply due to inconvenient transportation. Sales are mainly to local shops to meet actual demand, and the market is more grounded and predictable, unlike foreign rice, which fluctuates wildly. Yesterday, as foreign rice prices showed strength in the morning, people's expectations also became unusually firm. Both new and old japonica rice sold briskly, with prices rising by two to three yuan. Specifically, new rice from Nanhui opened at 153 yuan, and old rice at 150 yuan. New japonica rice from Pudong was priced as high as 153.5 yuan, and then at 150.05 yuan. As for thick broken japonica rice from Wuxi, sales were relatively slow due to slightly larger arrivals, and no transactions were reported.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market still has ample supply and inventory, and sellers' sentiment is quite firm. Retail sales to food stalls and cake shops are also quite brisk. Consequently, the price of glutinous rice has increased by one yuan amidst the high prices of other goods. Hong Kong special white glutinous rice sold for 128-129 yuan, high-grade glutinous rice for 127 yuan, then 123 yuan, and glutinous tea rice for 114.5-114 yuan.</p>

<h3>Local Merchants Continue to Actively Purchase Vermicelli</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the vermicelli market showed considerable activity due to the bullish sentiment from the previous day. Local merchants were actively purchasing vermicelli in response to the rising prices, and weekend retail sales were also good. Additionally, there were inquiries about exporting existing vermicelli stock, and new orders had not yet been finalized, leading to upward market sentiment and gradually rising prices. Jinlong vermicelli from West Godown rose from 30.07 yuan to 30.08 yuan, East Godown vermicelli to 31.55 yuan, and Paotai vermicelli from 32.665 yuan to 32.7 yuan. Banana vermicelli was priced at 22.5 yuan, all increasing by two to three yuan compared to the previous market price. However, by the afternoon, the number of buyers suddenly decreased, and those seeking to profit from the price increase were unable to sell out completely. The market quickly turned sluggish. In the afternoon market, West Godown vermicelli was initially sold at 31.75 yuan, but later there were few buyers even at 30.06 yuan. Transaction volume was less than 10,000 bags. However, the supply of wheat was low, and the market remained strong.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: News of Continued Oil Arrivals in Shanghai; Oil Merchants Remain Silent</h3>
<p>The edible oil market has been sluggish recently due to the surge in supply and slow sales. News has emerged that large quantities are still arriving from Tianjin and Qingdao, and that Dalian oil is also expected to arrive in Shanghai. This has caused oil merchants to remain silent, afraid to engage in speculation. Other speculative groups involved in yarn, cotton, and rice have also expressed their inability to influence the market. Consequently, the market has lacked support and has continued to decline. Yesterday, the prices of various oils fell by two to five yuan compared to the previous day. Sales included over 200 barrels of raw Qingdao oil and soybean oil, over 8,000 piculs of Daya Factory refined oil, and around 5,000 barrels of Rihua Factory vegetable oil. Lide and Yoshida factories each sold 100 barrels of vegetable oil. (Detailed prices are in the market price section)</p>
<h3>Textiles: Autumn Sales Progress</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market rose slightly yesterday as rumors subsided and interest from traders and hoarders increased. Retail sales by local merchants also progressed due to seasonal demand, leading to a uniform increase in cloth prices. White cloth, both coarse and fine, and twill cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. Dyed cloth increased by about 0.5 yuan in some cases. Transaction volume decreased due to Saturday. Approximately 100 pieces of coarse cloth were purchased by the Zhejiang-East Textile Merchant Guild, and 40-50 pieces by other groups. The Guangdong-Hong Kong and Nanyang Merchant Guild purchased 200-300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth, and dyed cloth. On the 21st, three pieces of textile were shipped to Singapore, and 360 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Rainproof Cloth Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Rainproof Cloth: Currently, there is brisk sales to Western-style clothing manufacturers, and the demand from merchants in this city is stronger than before. This is because the quality and appearance of these cloths, in various shades of color, are similar to imported fabrics. While imported fabrics sell for around 40 yuan per yard, the rainproof cloth only sells for around 6-7 yuan. Jin Xiong brand rainproof cloth has been on the market for a long time and is in high demand. As a result, companies such as Rentai, Yinbian, and Shuanglu have recently increased production significantly, and their prices are a few cents cheaper per yard than Yousheng. However, buyers still prefer the Jin Xiong brand. Yesterday, Rentai's Renyuan Taishan and Yin Xinji brands were sold at 6.5 yuan, and Yousheng's Jin Xiong brand was sold at 6.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand is Firm; Dutch Red is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a telegram from Holland regarding sugar. Coarse sand for shipment in October and November was priced at US$7.35 CIF &amp; KG.

Taikoo White DY mark was priced at 144 yuan, HX mark at 138 yuan, down 0.5 yuan. H mark coarse red was priced at 114 yuan, and Dutch Red at 123.5 yuan to 122.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan.

<p>The cork oak is a type of tree belonging to the Quercus genus of the Fagaceae family. One type grows in China, distributed in Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. It is a deciduous tree, growing up to 25 meters tall. The type that grows along the Mediterranean coast, in countries like Spain, Portugal, southern France, Italy, Sicily, and Algeria, is an evergreen tree, growing up to 20 meters tall, but usually only 6-7 meters. The two types are very similar in appearance; their leaves are alternate, oblong-shaped, with short petioles, thick texture, serrated edges, and dense white or grayish-white soft hairs on the underside. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on the same tree: male flowers are arranged in long, drooping spikes; female flowers grow in the leaf axils or at the ends of branches, in capitate inflorescences that stand erect. The fruit is an acorn, with a bowl-shaped cupule at the base.</p>
<p>Currently, Spain and Portugal are the largest producers of cork, supplying over half of the world's needs. Therefore, the Mediterranean cork oak has attracted our attention and interest. Everything described below refers to it.</p>
<p>From birth to the age of five or six, the outer bark of the cork oak is smooth. Afterwards, it slowly begins to crack. These cracks can be very deep in older trees, sometimes reaching 30 centimeters (one Chinese foot). This layer of outer bark is absolutely not suitable for use as cork as we commonly know it. Europeans call it "male cork." It is necessary to peel off this layer of male outer bark, and then the fine, soft, and elastic "female cork" can grow underneath.</p>
<p>In reality, all oaks, botanical plants, can produce cork; that is, they can all utilize their cambium layer, producing parenchyma tissue inward and phellem tissue outward, which is cork. Therefore, cork is simply some dead tissue. However, in flexible oak plants, this cork extends very deep into the wood, and there is no fixed location; this results in alternating layers of wood and cork, which we cannot utilize at all. As for the "cork oak," its cambium layer is always outside the wood and does not migrate. Although initially hard and soft cork layers alternate in production—this layer separation can sometimes be seen very clearly on a bottle stopper—after the age of ten, its cork-producing function gets on track, and from then on it simply produces cork step by step.</p>
<p>The procedure of removing the outer bark (female cork) for the first time can only be done when the tree is fifteen years old, at which point the circumference of the trunk is probably 30 centimeters. People use an ax or saw to make two types of cuts on the trunk: one that goes around the trunk, and one that goes straight up and down. Then, using the duck-billed ax handle, they pry open and remove the bark, which is shaped like a "cannon barrel." From then on, the tree's cambium layer slowly produces the fine cork. However, it is always necessary to wait ten or fifteen years—depending entirely on the environment in which the tree is located—for the cork to grow to a thickness of around three centimeters, at which point it can be harvested in the manner described earlier. However, whether removing the outer bark or harvesting the cork, one should never strip the tree completely bare, leaving it exposed to the elements, which can cause injury or death. A Frenchman named Capgrand Mothe was the first to have a great sense of compassion, fearing that the cork oak would be embarrassed by having its "pants" removed, and thought to put a coat on it; that is, to wrap the tree with rags or worthless male cork that had been peeled off. As a result, the cork obtained was finer and had fewer gaps. To clarify: removing the outer bark or harvesting the cork is generally done in the month from June 15th to July 15th; trees from 50 to 150 years old produce the best quality cork.

<h3>Shanghai This Afternoon at 1:30 PM: The Rare Phenomenon of a Partial Solar Eclipse Will Be Visible; 92% of the Sun Will Be Obscured; Cloudy Skies Will Affect Observation</h3>
<p>Today, Shanghai and the central part of China will be able to witness the first total solar eclipse in 400 years. This total solar eclipse will first appear around 12 noon in Soviet Central Asia. Twenty-seven minutes later, it will enter Chinese territory from Xinjiang, moving southeast through Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and exiting through northern Fujian at 1:30 PM. Around 3 PM, it will end northeast of Taiwan. At that point, the moon's shadow will bid farewell to the Earth. The total time spent within China is approximately 80 minutes, covering a distance of approximately 2,350 kilometers. In terms of the duration of the total solar eclipse visible in various locations, northern Fujian will have the longest duration at 2 minutes and 21 seconds. However, the current weather conditions in southeastern China are highly unfavorable, making it difficult to obtain satisfactory results in Fujian. The observation sites in Gansu and Russia appear to be the most convenient. The average width of the total eclipse is approximately 135 kilometers. What is visible in Shanghai will only be a partial eclipse. At 1:30 PM (new time), 92% of the sun's surface will be obscured by the moon's shadow.</p>
<p>If the weather is clear today, it will suddenly turn dark, as if it were nighttime. Because solar eclipses are rare and are related to various astronomical and scientific knowledge, astronomers from various countries have formed teams to go to suitable locations for observation in order to collect solid materials. For ordinary people who wish to observe with the naked eye, the simplest method is to use ordinary glasses fitted with black lenses, such as those used by sailors for sextants. Glasses that have been partially or completely smoked black can also be used for observation. However, whether there will be changes in the weather today is a major concern for those observing the eclipse, because if the sky is covered by clouds, it will inevitably affect the observation of the eclipse and cause various difficulties. According to the meteorological reports from various locations reported by the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, it was raining in the sky over Hankou, while it was clear in Nanjing. The average atmospheric pressure in Shanghai is not very low, but it is still difficult to determine whether there will be changes in the weather today.</p>
<p>Observation Times</p>
<p>According to experts, the predicted time for the first contact (when the edges of the sun and moon first touch) in Shanghai is 1:09 PM, the time of maximum eclipse (i.e., the greatest partial eclipse) is 1:30 PM, and the time of restoration (when the sun completely emerges from the moon's shadow) is 2:04 PM. The area in China where the total solar eclipse is visible covers approximately 116 counties in eight provinces. In the above areas, the longest duration of the total solar eclipse, from totality (when the sun is completely obscured) to reappearance (when the sun first emerges from the moon's shadow), is 3 minutes and 20 seconds.</p>
<p>A Fortunate Opportunity</p>
<p>This total eclipse is truly a rare celestial phenomenon that occurs only once every few centuries. Assuming that China's area accounts for two-fiftieths of the globe, the opportunity for the center of the total eclipse belt to fall in China occurs only once every century. In terms of time and location, being visible at noon in the densely populated areas along the Yellow River and Yangtze River, in the past 500 years, apart from one occurrence in the Yellow River basin in July of the 21st year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty (1542), today is the second time. The distance between the two occurrences is four centuries. Therefore, our ability to witness a total solar eclipse today is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Breaking Superstition</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA invited Mr. Xu Lu, the director of the Engineering Department of Zhijiang University, to give a lecture on solar eclipses, which was held at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. The lecture, entitled "The Principles of Solar Eclipses and Methods of Observation," recounted that solar eclipses are not strange events, and have been discovered countless times since history began. However, superstitious ideas prevailed in ancient times. Now that science is flourishing, the time of a solar eclipse can be calculated in advance. This total eclipse is truly a once-in-a-century opportunity. The principles of solar eclipses were repeatedly emphasized and explained in detail.</p>
<p>A Brilliant Spectacle</p>
<p>According to Xu's lecture, in the moment before the solar eclipse, the moon's black shadow gradually approaches and merges with the sun from west to east. At this time, the moon becomes a black shadow, which proves that the moon itself cannot emit light. A chromosphere is seen around the circumference of the two intersecting celestial bodies (sun and moon), emitting intense flames. According to records, these flames reach tens of thousands of miles in height. Sunspots are where these flames erupt. During the total eclipse, the observed flames have different shapes and colors, some resembling orchid leaves, some resembling fountains, and some resembling eruptions. The largest flames, furthest from the eruption point, are approximately several million miles long. There is also strong radiation emitting from the flames, creating a magnificent and spectacular sight.</p>

<h3>How to Observe a Total Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>— Written by Priest Mao Ruoxu, Director of the Xujiahui Observatory</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter drove to Xujiahui to visit Priest Xu Runnong, who introduced him to Priest Mao Ruoxu (Lepere K. Dumas, S.J.), the acting director of the Observatory. Priest Mao is a renowned astronomer, famous throughout the world. He specially published an article in Shen Bao on the day of the total eclipse, explaining the best locations to observe the solar eclipse, which has scientific value. As for the essay on this total eclipse, it will be published in the Chinese National Magazine (La Revue National Chinoise) in October, which those concerned about solar eclipses should definitely read. Translator's Note</p>
<p>The total eclipse of September 21, 1941, provides observers of solar eclipses with a good opportunity to choose an observation location, because the area traversed by the total eclipse's shadow is very wide, approximately 7,000 kilometers or more. The entire duration of the eclipse is seven minutes and forty seconds, which is not extremely long, but is sufficient for observation, while the duration of totality is two hundred and two seconds. The eclipse's path travels from northwest to southeast, dividing the Asian continent into two parts, passing through various different regions, including plateaus, deserts, river areas, hilly areas, and finally the southeastern coast of China. The eclipse begins at sunrise in the North Caucasus, and its shadow gradually progresses through the Caspian Sea and Soviet Central Asia, before entering Chinese territory from the northwest, crossing the heart of the country, dividing the entire territory into two parts, and then leaving Chinese territory and disappearing into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The path of the total eclipse—its progress through China—is explained in detail in the attached map. It enters Xinjiang Province at 8:37 AM (Xinjiang time). The average width of the total eclipse belt is approximately 130 kilometers. After that, it takes only 80 minutes to sweep across China in a southeasterly direction, covering a distance of 4,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>The areas through which the solar eclipse's shadow passes are as follows: the Tianshan Mountains and the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang Province, the northern Tarim Basin, northern Qinghai Province, southern Gansu Province, southern Shaanxi Province, all of Hubei Province, a small part of southern Zhejiang Province, and northern Fujian Province. There are also many famous cities within the shadow area, such as Kuqa and Luntai in Xinjiang Province, Lintao and Tianshui in Gansu Province, with the provincial capital Lanzhou just outside the shadow area, Fengxian and Ankang in Shaanxi Province, Baokang and Xianning in Hubei Province, as well as the three towns of Wuhan, Jiujiang and Yongxiu in Jiangxi Province, as well as the provincial capital Nanchang, Pucheng, Jianyang, and Fuan in Fujian Province, as well as other famous cities that are not listed here. The total eclipse belt passes through the most densely populated parts of mainland China, crossing many highways and seven important railway lines, including the Longhai Railway, the Pinghan Railway, the Yuehan Railway, the Nanchang-Hunan Railway, the entire Nansun Railway, the Nanjing-Nanchang Railway, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It also crosses the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that the Chinese government has dispatched two observation teams to Fujian and Gansu to record the phenomena of the solar eclipse. In the near future, we will surely receive good reports.</p>
<h3>Further Extension of the Deadline for Goods Stored in Customs Warehouses</h3>
<p>Regarding imported goods stored in customs warehouses, the Jianghai Customs has issued another notice extending the storage deadline. It is now known that the Customs believes that the situation has not yet become peaceful, and therefore has extended the deadline for imported goods stored in customs warehouses again until the end of this year. This measure has a significant impact on commodity prices, and it is hoped that there will be no further extensions in the future, so as to avoid fueling speculation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Announces Flood Prevention Plan: Raising Ground Level Along the River in the Central and Northern Districts; Installing Valves on All Underground Sewers; Building a Large New Ditch and Installing Pumps in the Western District</h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Municipal Council, the Public Works Department has recognized that waterlogging has frequently plagued the Settlement in recent years, causing significant impact. Therefore, a plan has been drafted to mitigate most of the flooding caused by factors beyond the Council's control. According to this plan, the ground level along the river in the central and northern districts of the Settlement will be raised to prevent the intrusion of extremely high tides. All underground sewers will be equipped with a type of valve, and pumps will be installed at some sewer outlets to drain rainwater during high tides. The western district of Shanghai, which is five times the size of the central district, is most prone to waterlogging during heavy rains. Therefore, similar measures as in other districts will be taken, including installing the same type of valves on underground sewers, burying a large new ditch that is eight feet deep and twelve feet wide, and installing a pump on top of the new ditch to drain approximately 1.5 million gallons of accumulated water per day. The eastern district has very little water accumulation, so fewer defensive measures are needed. The aforementioned plan was approved by the Council at its regular meeting on the 17th of this month, with an estimated cost of around 4 million yuan. It is planned to allocate one-tenth of the funds this year, and the flood prevention project is planned to be initiated quickly, with the goal of completing most of it before the start of the flood season next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Gimson's Great Efforts</p>
<p>This summer, the city has repeatedly experienced flooding, and citizens have criticized the authorities for neglecting flood prevention. However, the public is unaware that Mr. Gimson, the Director of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, has been quietly drafting a plan, overcoming various difficulties related to the details, and has finally devised a solution to the Shanghai flooding problem. It is said that the Public Works Department completed its plan after conducting various experiments, and submitted it to the Council in the form of concrete and specific recommendations. As for the implementation of this plan, it is not yet known exactly how long it will take to complete. However, qualified sources say that the duration should not exceed two years. Considering the magnitude of the project, the two-year period cannot be considered long. Shanghai has suffered from flooding since time immemorial due to its low-lying terrain. Whenever there is torrential rain, even if it only lasts for a few hours, the central district, especially the areas on the outer roads of the Settlement, are invariably plagued by water accumulation.</p>
<p>Preventing Flooding is Beneficial to Shanghai</p>
<p>The damages suffered by Shanghai as a result of this have not been accurately quantified, but it is estimated to be over one million yuan annually. From an agricultural point of view, vegetable growers have been disappointed in Shanghai, so almost all of the vegetables needed by the city are supplied from other cities. The repeated flooding of the central commercial district of the Public Settlement and the major thoroughfares of the French Concession has also caused great inconvenience to the citizens. Flooding has been particularly severe in recent years, so the criticism directed at the authorities has been more intense than in previous years. Qualified sources believe that completely preventing flooding is a huge project that the Municipal Council cannot undertake. Even if it were possible, the Council would have difficulty raising the huge amount of funding required. However, any plan that can improve the flooding situation is beneficial to the city.</p>
<p>Dredging the Huangpu River Cannot Be Neglected</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" stated that the Municipal Council has approved the flood prevention plan proposed by Mr. Gimson, the Director of the Public Works Department of the Council, and has decided to allocate 4 million yuan to implement it. Taxpayers in the Public Settlement fear that taxes will be increased again. Some people have stated that the Council should make a greater effort to restore the dredging work around Shanghai by the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, as this would be the best strategy. The most important reason for flooding in Shanghai is the lack of dredging of the Huangpu River and the various creeks connecting to the city since the outbreak of the war in 1937. Unless the dredging work is restored, the plan that the Municipal Council intends to implement is bound to fail, and will only cause taxpayers to bear unnecessary burdens. The reporter recently asked a spokesperson for the Municipal Council about these points. According to the response, the flood prevention plan will not fail.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Remaining Black Market Foreign Exchange; US Dollar Notes Must Have Restricted Circulation; Following the Example of British Gold Pound Notes</h3>
<p>The recently published "Millard's Review" contained an article by A. B. Aaleson, stating that since the Exchange Equalization Fund has been managing the foreign exchange market, there are still remnants of the black market for foreign exchange in the city. The reasons for this are no more than three: (1) US dollar notes can still be freely bought and sold in Shanghai. The price of each US dollar actually exceeds the statutory exchange rate of the Exchange Equalization Fund by more than two yuan. All banks can generally accept and pay with them, unlike British gold pound notes, which British banks generally refuse to accept and pay with, except for special reasons. (2) The foreign exchange provided before the democratic countries' banks implemented the freeze on funds on July 26 can continue to be cashed abroad. The black market buys this type of foreign exchange at an increased price. (3) The black market can purchase foreign exchange for export goods at a price that is one-tenth higher than the Exchange Equalization Fund's exchange rate. For these reasons, remnants of the black market still remain. The buyers in the black market are no more than those whose imported goods cannot obtain foreign exchange from the banks designated by the Exchange Equalization Fund, and foreigners who are unable to obtain foreign exchange after selling real estate, etc. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund must request the US, British, and Dutch governments to notify banks, warning them that the statutory foreign exchange for imported goods must not flow into the black market, and request that the United States stop the circulation of US dollar notes abroad. Foreign exchange for export goods must be sold to the banks designated by the Exchange Equalization Fund at the statutory exchange rate. In this way, the remnants of the black market foreign exchange can be eliminated, which will prove to be of great benefit to the city, as merchants suffer significant losses during flooding. As for the method of raising the 4 million yuan needed by the Municipal Council, it will be decided soon. It cannot be said now whether this money will be raised by increasing taxes.</p>
<h3>The SS Zoella Lykes Sets Sail Without Unloading Gasoline</h3>
<p>The new cargo ship SS Zoella Lykes of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai for the first time on the evening of the 11th of this month and docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload cargo. After the cargo was unloaded, it was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Manila on the 16th. Unexpectedly, due to the fact that more than 7,000 barrels of gasoline were still on board and customs formalities had not been completed, it was detained by the customs. After learning of this, the Japanese authorities immediately notified the customs, ordering that the gasoline on board had to be unloaded in Shanghai. After negotiations with the customs and the Japanese consulate by the American consulate, a resolution was reached. The ship set sail at 2 p.m. yesterday and exited the Wusongkou at 3:50 p.m., heading straight for the Philippines. None of the gasoline on board was unloaded, and it was transported to the Philippines as originally planned, without any fines.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Sniper Attack: Japanese Ultimatum</h3>
<p>According to Dalu News, Horiuchi, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, has sent a note to the Shanghai Municipal Council, urging it to pay attention to the recent sniper attacks on Japanese nationals in the International Settlement. A spokesman for the Municipal Council confirmed that the Council had received the note, stating that "the Council is greatly concerned about this situation." However, the spokesman declined to say how the Municipal Council would respond to the note.</p>
<h3>Robbers Snatch Guard's Box Cannon, Guard Shot Dead, Original Gun and Robber's Gun Seized, Another Guard's Handgun Robbed and Wounded by Bullet</h3>
<p>A guard named Ge Xitai, from Yangzhou, forty-eight years old, badge number 627, working at No. 25, Lane, Beile Road, i.e. Baoanli in the French Concession, was on duty at the lane entrance at about 6:30 p.m. yesterday when three robbers suddenly approached, pretending to ask for directions. Two of the robbers then produced handguns,</p>
<p>Threatening Ge</p>
<p>and forbidding him from making any noise. One of the robbers, unarmed, forcibly cut the lanyard of the box cannon he was wearing with scissors, and snatched the weapon. However, Ge was unwilling to submit and followed closely behind. As the robbers fled north to Luzon Road, crossed Avenue Edward VII, and reached Chongqing Road and Weihaiwei Road, the guard secretly reported to a Chinese constable on duty, who joined in the pursuit. The constable drew his gun and fired a shot, which struck one of the robbers near his right breast,</p>
<p>Penetrating his Back</p>
<p>and killing him on the spot. The other two robbers managed to escape. The constable found the original stolen box cannon in the dead man's pocket, as well as a robber's gun. The body was sent by Constable No. 3198 to Shijiang Hospital and then to the morgue. It is reported that the dead robber was about thirty years old and was wearing a brown striped woolen suit. In another incident yesterday, a guard's handgun was robbed and he was wounded by a bullet.</p>
<h3>Restriction on Gasoline Supply, New Methods to be Established, Maximum Supply Limit of Sixty Gallons per Month</h3>
<p>It is reported that British company Asiatic Petroleum Company and American company Texaco are considering specific measures to restrict the amount of gasoline used by consumers in the city. The general idea is to supply based on the average amount used in the past four, five, six, three months, but the maximum supply limit is 60 gallons per month. Nighttime service will be suspended, effective from the 23rd. Gasoline sales will also be suspended on Sundays. According to investigations, Shanghai's gasoline reserves have increased slightly recently due to the arrival of British and American ships, which brought a batch of gasoline. It can supply the city for about six more days. The implementation of the restrictions this time is due to the past occurrence of black market transactions, so it is necessary to prevent them.</p>

<h3>Extortionist Arrested in Dadong Teahouse, Stole a Handgun and Took a Risk, Extortion Finally Leads to Legal Trouble</h3>
<p>The extortionist Wu Bohe, also known as Zhang Jianhua, (28 years old this year, from Ningbo) colluded with Hua Ziming, who is at large, between the 4th and 9th of this month, sending letters to the home of Yu Ronglu, a wealthy Shanghai merchant from Ningbo, at No. 18, Lane 58, Metcalfe Road, extorting US$2,000 (equivalent to 40,000 legal currency). He was arrested by the Chengdu Road Police Station, and a Whiteley-brand handgun and seven bullets were seized. He was taken into custody for investigation.</p>
<p>Stealing a Handgun</p>
<p>The defendant confessed that he was introduced by a friend to work as a clerk at Laoda Fang Tea and Food Shop at No. 542, Nanjing Road, on March 1 last year. After being dismissed by the shop owner Chen Zhenyan on June 30, he went to Suzhou to join the army. On March 3 of this year, he secretly came to Shanghai with Zhu Liang after conspiring to do so. Late at night, they pried open the wooden door of Laoda Fang, broke into the shop, opened the cash register drawer, and stole Chen Zhenyan's self-defense handgun and more than 100 bullets, returning to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Resorting to Suicide</p>
<p>Around August 20, he saw a young man attempting suicide in the park. After he managed to rescue him, he inquired about the reason for his suicide. The young man claimed to be surnamed Yu, named Xiaochun, from Ningbo, and a cousin of the plaintiff in this case. Due to unemployment and inability to make a living, he had begged people for help without success, feeling that living in the world was meaningless, so he attempted suicide. Zhu Liang learned of the situation and also resented Yu Ronglu for not caring about his own family, so he took Yu Xiaochun to Suzhou and decided to ask Yu Ronglu to provide Yu Xiaochun with US$2,000, otherwise, they would end his life.</p>
<p>Extortion</p>
<p>Therefore, Hua Ziming and I were sent to Shanghai with hand grenades, a handgun, bullets, and extortion letters to deliver. According to the confession, the police sent the criminal Wu to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning, filing a public prosecution for crimes of extortion, theft, and endangering public safety. Judge Zhong took the bench and heard the case. Zhu, a maid of the plaintiff's family, testified that on the morning of the 4th of this month, the defendant came to our back door, took out a package, and asked me to send it upstairs for the master to see. I ignored him, and he then used a gun to force me to take it up. The master opened the package, which contained a bomb and an extortion letter. The master then telegraphed the police station, who sent detectives to take the bomb away.</p>
<p>Solving the Case in the Teahouse</p>
<p>And ordered the master to pretend to agree to pay the money, and to go to the Bund Park to deliver it as agreed. But on the morning of the 9th, the defendant himself broke the appointment, and in the afternoon, he called my master and asked him to go to Dadong Teahouse to pay the money. Following up, the plaintiff Yu Yinglu testified that before I went to Dadong Teahouse, I had already notified the police station, and pre-arranged plainclothes detectives to wait in the teahouse. When the defendant arrived at about 4 o'clock and was in contact with him, the detectives swarmed up and arrested him, and seized a handgun loaded with live ammunition from his side. After the court verified the situation and questioned the defendant in detail, he was ordered to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was postponed to the 27th. The handgun bullets were first returned to Chen Zhenyan to receive.</p>
<h3>New Hong Kong Government Entry Regulations Witness Qualifications</h3>
<p>In order to meet wartime needs, the Hong Kong government has promulgated new entry regulations, strictly limiting entry and transit passengers. The newly established conditions for guarantors applying for entry permits are as follows: (1) Justices of the Peace in Hong Kong; (2) Barristers or lawyers practicing in Hong Kong; (3) Chinese government agencies with offices in Hong Kong; (4) Major banks or shipping companies in Hong Kong; (5) Those who hold title deeds to land in Hong Kong proving that they are wholly owned by them; (6) Managers of Western or Chinese General Chamber of Commerce or owners of member firms under them, or office staff of the firms; (7) Members of stock trading associations or brokerage trading associations, etc. Only then will they have the power to sign guarantees for others. The regulations stipulate that the guarantor must sign at the Immigration Department before approval can be granted, with the aim of preventing the mixing in of undesirable elements. However, temporary entry permits issued by China Travel Service are still given preferential treatment. Transit passengers are allowed to be exempted from providing a guarantor and given a special certificate to pass through Hong Kong. Those visiting relatives are also exempted from guarantee and given a special certificate with a time limit to leave Hong Kong, because the company has handled entry matters in the past with good credit, and are allowed to continue to handle matters flexibly according to previous practice.</p>
<h3>French Police Station Russian Police Team Invites Bids for Food Supply</h3>
<p>The French Police Station invites bids for the food supply for the Russian Police Team for the fourth quarter of this year, including fresh meat, fish, vegetables, and other food items. Those interested in bidding must submit their bids to the Secretariat of the French Police Station (No. 22, Avenue Pichon) before 12 o'clock on September 25 of this year. The bidding date is scheduled for Thursday, September 25 of this year. For all details, please contact the Secretariat of the French Police Station at No. 22, Avenue Pichon.</p>
<h3>Xu Guangcai Acquitted</h3>
<p>Xu Guangcai, the young owner of the Xingtong Ironworks at Nos. 219 to 121, Jielu Road, North Railway Station, who was previously accused of defrauding machinery, was heard by Judge Huang Risheng's special court on the 15th of this month and adjourned for debate. This morning at 11 o'clock, Judge Huang Risheng took the bench again in the Ninth Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Jiang Baokang, the police lawyer, also appeared in court to state the case. After hearing the statements of the plaintiff and defendant, Xu Guangcai was acquitted and released in court.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from All Circles</h3>
<p>Eyeglasses for Watching the Solar Eclipse The solar eclipse today is the first total eclipse in more than 300 years, and is truly a unique opportunity for scientific research. A new type of glasses has been invented in the United States that can block all reflected light through the lenses. When used to observe the solar eclipse, it is no different from a small instrument for observing astronomy, and is very clear. They are called Polar Vari-Light Glasses and can be purchased from Maochang Optical Company.</p>
<p>Free Loan of Solar Eclipse Glasses Wu Liangcai Optical Company on Nanjing Road, in view of the rare opportunity of a total solar eclipse in four hundred years, and the fact that citizens will certainly want to see it, has specially prepared 3,000 sets of black lenses for free loan, which can be used to view the entire solar eclipse without affecting the eyes in the slightest. Its enthusiasm for serving the community is evident.</p>

<h3>A Note on the Industrial Accident at the Xin Xin Mooncake Factory</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin Company's mooncake factory, located on Niuzhuang Road, is a three-bay house with a spacious area. In the corner of the room is a baking oven, which is about the size of a room, and as high as the eaves. Steel grids are stacked in layers, and steam is boiling. The mooncakes are placed inside and replaced from time to time, so there is no immersion in gas or the drawback of being over-burnt. It is said to have been designed by experts and recently completed. Opposite the oven is the ingredient room, and to the right is the mooncake printing room. Dozens of male and female workers are all dressed in snow-white clothes and hats, which is quite neat. They are arranged at tables, each performing their duties, moving quickly and in an orderly manner. Once the mooncakes are printed, they are placed on steel trays and sent to be baked in batches. According to technician Zhuo Junyan, the amount of ingredients used and the seasoning process are all personally handled by me. Even the smallest nut must be peeled and washed clean. Zhuo Junyan believes that ordinary mooncakes are too sweet and greasy, and are not suitable for serving with wine. The Phoenix Thousand-Layer Mooncake is designed to make up for this shortcoming. All the ingredients used in the mooncake are savory, and are based on fresh and delicious ingredients that can be served with wine. The crust of the mooncake is made with genuine white shortening and lotus seed paste, which is soft and snow-white, and is the Vitamin Mooncake. Other mooncakes, such as the Yuanbao Gold and Silver Mooncakes, are also quite interesting and suitable for women's psychology. As for the various brocade boxes, they are all able to come up with new ideas and never stick to old methods. The decoration is extremely exquisite, and the styles include fan-shaped, oval, crescent-shaped, octagonal, plum blossom-shaped and various patterns, so the boxes are elegant and beautiful according to the shape of the mooncakes.</p>

<h3>Observation and Experiment of Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunlu</p>
<p>A solar eclipse is truly a cosmic spectacle. In broad daylight, a dark shadow suddenly comes from the west, gradually obscuring the sun, and suddenly the world becomes dark. After a few minutes, the sun slowly reappears, still shining on the earth. But this phenomenon is difficult to see. According to astronomers, there are an average of 238 solar eclipses every 100 years, of which only 66 are total eclipses. If we talk about a certain place, then the chance of seeing it is even less, only once every 360 years.</p>
<p>We are very lucky that there happens to be a solar eclipse at noon today; and this solar eclipse, in some places in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces, can see the total solar eclipse. Children who live in Shanghai can also see a partial solar eclipse (only part of it is eclipsed). Many scientists have brought various instruments to observe in places with total eclipses, because this is a rare opportunity in decades!</p>
<p>Children! Although we do not have observation instruments and cannot run to the place of the total eclipse. But you can't miss this opportunity to observe with the naked eye. If the sunlight is too strong during a partial eclipse and the naked eye cannot look directly at it, you can wear a pair of sunglasses or tinted glasses, or you can see through colored or tinted glass. If you put some clear water in a basin, then pour some ink into it, stir it evenly and put it in the sunlight, so that the sunlight is reflected from the surface of the water for observation, then many people can observe it together (as shown in the picture above). As for the principle of solar eclipses, I think the children have already understood it. That is because the moon travels between the sun and the earth, blocking the light from the sun to the earth, and a part of the earth is in the shadow behind the moon, and this becomes a solar eclipse (as shown in the picture above). To deeply understand this principle, you can use a simple method to do an experiment yourself. Use candlelight (or kerosene lamp) to represent the sun, a ball (or something else) to represent the moon, and your head to represent the earth. If one is on a straight line, then the candlelight is blocked by the ball, and the cause of the solar eclipse is also the same. If you move the ball up or down slightly, you can see part of the candlelight, which is exactly the same as a partial solar eclipse. Move it again, and the candlelight is completely exposed, which can indicate the principle that even if the moon is in the middle of the sun and the earth, a solar eclipse does not occur (as shown in the middle picture).</p>
<p>Dear children! Observation and experiment are important tasks in scientific research, which can help you to expose the mysterious phenomena of nature and to reveal the truth of natural changes. Children, give it a try!</p>

<h3>What is a Solar Eclipse?</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>Brother: Brother, what exactly is a solar eclipse? I learned very little about astronomy at school. A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that there will be a solar eclipse this year, and that most of this area is in China!</p>
<p>Brother: Astronomy is indeed a very profound science, but solar eclipses are not difficult to explain clearly in simple terms.</p>
<p>Brother: Then please explain my doubts in the simplest terms.</p>
<p>Brother: Okay, let's start! The sun's rays shining on the earth are blocked by the moon in the middle, which is called a solar eclipse. Complete blockage means that the sun cannot be seen on earth, which is called a total eclipse. Blocking part of it still allows you to see the sun, but there is a piece missing, which is called a partial eclipse.</p>
<p>Brother: The moon is much smaller than the sun, how can it block the huge sunlight?</p>
<p>Brother: Yes, the moon is very small, so the area of the solar eclipse is a very small part of the earth. However, the reason why it can block the sunlight in the solar eclipse area can be proved by experiment: first close your left eye, and put a copper coin in front of your right eye about half a foot away, and look at the sun, can't you see the sun?</p>
<p>Brother: Ah! Yes, if there were no copper coins, my eyes would definitely not be able to open.</p>
<p>Brother: Because the copper coin blocked your line of sight to the sun, you can only get the light reflected from the side. It's not completely dark like during a solar eclipse, because the solar eclipse area is large, and the reflected light from the side cannot reach the line of sight, so it is naturally dark. Now open your left eye and look at the sun...</p>
<p>Brother: I am forced to open it.</p>
<p>Brother: This is because the copper coin is too small to block the line of sight of both eyes at the same time. Just like during a solar eclipse, place A becomes dark and place B remains bright.</p>
<p>Brother: I heard that there is also something called a gold coin eclipse, what exactly is it?</p>
<p>Brother: The earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical, so the distance between the earth and the sun is far and near. When the sun is farther away from the earth, the moon can only block the central part of the sun, so it looks like a gold coin, you might as well try it with a copper coin.</p>
<p>Brother: Oh! I remembered, in Chinese customs, there is something called "wild moon swallowing domestic moon" which we call a lunar eclipse. It must be that the earth is in the middle blocking the sunlight shining on the moon.</p>
<p>Brother: Not only is it so during a lunar eclipse, but the waxing and waning of the moon at ordinary times is also related to the earth and the sun.</p>
<p>Brother: Astronomers have a very clear understanding of the sun, why are they still tirelessly researching it?</p>
<p>Brother: Of course, there is no end to learning, I want to get new discoveries from this. And recently there was a person named Einstein who created many theories, many of which are different from before. Many scientists want to prove whether his theory is consistent with the facts, so they must observe the facts in detail. However, this kind of science is more profound and cannot be simply explained.</p>
<h3>The Height of Body Temperature</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>My younger sister's fever subsided a little the next morning. On this day, Mother got up early and came to see my younger sister. She touched Mother's forehead. Although the fever had subsided a lot, it had not completely gone away. Such a good result overnight had made her old heart a lot more at ease. Otherwise, with a worried mind, she would have eaten half less dinner last night, and even had trouble falling asleep at night.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, my younger sister's fever has subsided a bit, otherwise, it would be a very annoying thing," Mother said softly with a look of joy on her face, so as not to disturb my younger sister's sleep.</p>
<p>"That's right, if the body temperature rises further, it would indeed be very dangerous," Ah Liang's father said casually, but these words contained some unlucky elements in Mother's mind, so she had to ask Ah Liang's father and him not to stay here any longer. So Ah Liang followed his father to another room. However, these words that Mother thought were unlucky entered Ah Liang's ears and aroused a question.</p>
<p>"Dad, then how high can a person's body temperature be?" Ah Liang asked softly.</p>
<p>"If a person's body temperature reaches 107 degrees Fahrenheit, that person will definitely not be able to live. It is 100% certain that he will die. Even if it reaches 105 degrees, it is very dangerous, but there is still a glimmer of hope, because once the body reaches such a high temperature, it seems to be burning, and the brain will stop functioning. If that person's body is originally not strong, even if it reaches 105 degrees, he will not be able to bear it and die. However, the strangest thing is that in summer, the weather is extremely hot, and when the mercury column of the thermometer rises to more than 120 degrees, we can still work and will not die from the heat. Even if it is hot to 140 or 150 degrees, people will not die from the heat, isn't this a very strange thing? What is the reason for this? It's all because our body has the ability to sweat, otherwise, we will inevitably die from the heat, because the hotter the weather, the more we sweat, and these high-temperature places must be very dry, so that your sweat can evaporate quickly, and the body will feel cooler. Although a person's body temperature cannot exceed the standard of 98.4 degrees, it cannot be too low either. If it drops below 66 degrees, he will also die. At this time, the blood vessels in the body are affected by the low body temperature and become paralyzed. The circulation of blood is also obstructed, leading to stiffness and death. Therefore, everyone's body temperature must reach the standard of 90.4 degrees, not a little more or a little less, otherwise, they cannot be considered healthy, and all human beings have such a standard body temperature, whether they are yellow, white, black, red and other different races of people, their body temperatures are mostly the same, which is also a very strange thing." Ah Liang's father then closed his storybox and went out.</p>

<h3>On the Types of Early Morning Movies</h3>
<p>— Courtesy and Righteousness</p>
<p>Besides the first-run movies, various cinemas screen early morning movies every Sunday and on public holidays. Obviously, this is to facilitate people who are usually too busy on weekdays, especially students. Here, leaving aside the main feature early morning screenings, let's talk about a few films that are regularly screened in the early morning. Generally speaking, the quality of early morning movies is quite high. Although the films screened in the early morning are not necessarily the biggest box office hits or the most critically acclaimed films of the past, early morning movies generally fall into three categories:</p>
<p>Musical films often account for the largest number of early morning films; this is naturally because the student community has a special love for singing. Deanna Durbin's musicals seem to be the most popular, such as "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "That Certain Age," "Mad About Music," and "It's a Date," which people never tire of watching. Secondly, such as "The Great Waltz," "Strike Up the Band," "Maytime," "Sweethearts," and "Ramona," are also beautiful musical masterpieces worth watching, and it is no accident that they are enthusiastically supported by the audience.</p>
<p>War films and films with grand scenes similar to war are also as popular as musical films. Errol Flynn's "The Adventures of Robin Hood," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," etc., are the most popular. Secondly, such as "The Charge of the Light Brigade," "The Last Days of Pompeii," "The Crusades," and "New Outlaws of the Marsh," often make people feel the need to watch them again, because they are so great and moving!</p>
<p>Historical films and literary films often attract a large audience, especially people with higher levels of knowledge, due to their moving themes. Such as "You Can't Take It With You," "The Life of Emile Zola," "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "Maid of Salem," "Camille," "Marie Antoinette," and "Oliver Twist," are all of profound significance. Sometimes, to cater to children, films such as "The Little Princess" and "Mulan" are screened; or horror films such as "The Invisible Man Returns" and "The Mad Doctor of Market Street"; or slapstick comedies such as "The Taming of the Shrew" and "Blockheads"; or cartoons such as "Mickey Mouse Collection" and "Donald Duck," the standard is lower!</p>
<p>In addition, it is worth mentioning that several domestic film theaters screen old films such as "Crossroads," "Street Angel," and "Lost Lamb," which have a special flavor. In short, the standard of early morning movies is high, and the price is extra cheap, which is a great convenience for people who are usually too busy!</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>The Road to Stardom for a Singer</h3>
<p>— Zeng Xuan</p>
<p>"The Road to Stardom for a Singer" focuses on the singing of the heroine Mary Martin, and the performance is humorous. Mary plays Cindy, a girl who is fascinated by singing and dancing. Her voice is not as soaring as Jeanette MacDonald's, but it is sweet, clear, and crisp, and her high and low notes are melodious and pleasant. Her performance is also very dedicated. Changing from a standard American accent to a southern American accent makes it even more unique.</p>
<p>Since "One Touch of Venus," the male lead, Don Ameche, has starred in several similar song and dance films, which are quite popular with the audience; however, it always feels that his facial muscles are not very flexible, so his acting is not amazing. Paramount probably borrowed him from 20th Century Fox to star in "The Road to Stardom for a Singer" because of his fame. In this film, Don plays director Lloyd. Although he has a lot of scenes, his acting skills are not as brilliant as before, and it seems that he will not have much progress in the future.</p>
<p>The original English name of "The Road to Stardom for a Singer" is translated as "Kiss the Boys Goodbye". The big advertisement for the film on the side of the road also depicts a girl raising her lips high, "waiting for a kiss." But the so-called "Kiss the Boys Goodbye" is just the name of a song in the film and has nothing to do with the film itself.</p>
<p>Several songs in this film are very pleasant to listen to. The song and dance scenes are not grand. Rochester, the gravel-voiced black man in the supporting cast, dances very well. In this film, there is only a short slapstick dance performance, and there is nothing new. The plot seems to be very ordinary. The heroine Cindy is a rich girl, but she fails the audition for a stage singer on Broadway in New York. Director Lloyd goes south to look for a female lead. Cindy returns to her hometown in the south and tricks Lloyd into her house. Cindy pretends to be pretentious, singing and dancing, but still does not meet Lloyd's expectations. She then forcibly drags Lloyd back to New York. Lloyd is eventually seduced by Cindy's beauty and promises her the lead role. Cindy suspects that Lloyd is deceiving her, and is very angry. At the welcome party, she deliberately flaunts her charm. When singing in public, she takes off all her clothes, leaving only a bathrobe, embarrassing Lloyd. The song is bleak and she returns to her hometown. Lloyd chases after her to explain the misunderstanding and make a vow of lifelong love. Then, the screen shows Don and Mary hugging and about to kiss, and then turning to the audience under the screen to say: "Everyone, it's over." This "gimmick" is seen for the first time.</p>
<h3>Random Scenes in the Art World</h3>

<h3>Qiongpa in the Blood Rain</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: A Fit of Anger Over a Beautiful Woman</p>
<p>Wu Sangui obtained Chen Yuanyuan, the number one beauty in Jiangnan, unintentionally during his trip to Beijing. What a pleasant thing! Therefore, he fully intended to take Yuanyuan out of the pass together. Who knew that his father, Wu Xiang, suddenly warned him, disapproving of his idea. How could he not be surprised and suspicious? So he asked his father what he meant. Wu Xiang said: "You have an imperial decree on your person. This trip to Beijing is to obey the summons. You should leave the pass early and mobilize troops to protect the capital. But you are greedy for sensual pleasures and linger, even if you get a Yuanyuan, it may not be your blessing, because if the emperor finds out about this, you will inevitably be punished. You are greedy for female beauty and neglect military affairs. How can you bear this? This is the first reason why it is not allowed. Furthermore, there is your legal wife, Madam Zhang. Although her appearance is not beautiful, her virtue is very good. It is a pity that she has a hand disease, that is, she is very jealous. You used to dote on a maidservant, Xiao Tao. Later, when she found out, she beat Xiao Tao to death with a club when you were not at home. Have you forgotten about this? If you bring Yuanyuan out of the pass this time and she sees it, won't she be jealous and make a big fuss? This is the second reason why it is not allowed. Moreover, after you leave the pass this time, you will immediately have to mobilize troops to enter the pass. You will be in a hurry to come and go, and there will not be many days for you to delay in Ningyuan. When you come to Beijing, you will inevitably have to bring Yuanyuan with you. So why bother and make trouble for yourself? Moreover, if you bring a woman into the army, your morale will not be high. This is the third reason why it is not allowed. With these three reasons why it is not allowed, I will not allow you to take Yuanyuan with you, which is entirely for your sake." (174)</p>
