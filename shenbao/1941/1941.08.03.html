<h3 id="c1">美總統頒特別命令實行禁止機油輸出　予日作戰以來最嚴重之打擊石油產品以平時輸出量為限 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統一日傍晚下令、禁止一切馬達燃料油及飛機所適用之各種油輸至西半球以外之國家、僅英帝國及其他從事抵抗侵略國家之未被佔領區域、得為例外、令文內雖未提及日本、但權威方面人士對記者表示、總統之禁令，顯係針對日本而發、並將為中日戰事發生以來、對日之最嚴重打擊、政府對汽油輸日所取之政策、因該令之貧布而臻於頂點、美全國輿論咸表滿意、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　在事先並無特別聲明之下、日本已完全不能獲取由美國運入之機器油及飛機上所用之油類矣、羅斯福總統禁止所有機器油及各種可用於飛機上之油類、並一切機器油之原料運至各外國、但西半球、英帝國及未渝陷之抵抗侵略者諸國則除外、中國駐美大使胡適博士對羅斯福此一舉動極表滿意、胡適博士稱「余借此舉將堅强吾等之士氣、同時對民主國之為自由而戰者、將有極大利益、査昨日禁油令未發表以前、所有美國之飛機油及機器油出口、本已必須領有出口執照、今乃全部被統制矣、白宮禁油之布吿文曰、「羅斯福總統已訓令出口統制行政官、開始為國防之利益計、頒行汽油出口之禁例、此舉將有兩種影響、（一）機器燃料飛機所適用之油類、以及若干製油原料、禁止出口運往西半球、英帝國及其他抵抗侵略國家之未被俱區域以外、</p>
<p>（二）其他汽油出產之輸出、除上列各地外、限制至經常或戰前之數量、並按照比例發給照會、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨施行實際對日本禁運一切摩托燃油及潤滑油、此間權威方面認為係對日本戰事機構之又一打擊，美總統此舉、雖顯係對日本而發、但並未提及日本之名、美總統特別命令、現行航空燃料及油之禁運、須絕對嚴緊施行、並設立機關、傳隨意施行其他一切種類之汽油及油之禁運、因此在認為有絕對禁運之必要時、日本所僅存之其他油供應、亦將隨時立即斷絕出口、管理局某發言人宣稱、此命令之動機、乃因獲有向靠之消息、謂德國及日本轟炸機、係用下等之航空汽油、較之美總統原已禁運者更為低另、羅斯福仍將繼續准許運油與日　本、俾能維持共非軍事工業、即係依照比例限制、其他石油產品之出口至戰前之平常數量，且須發給出口照會、出口管理發言人稱、日本及其他規定之國家、可取得特種之油、如火爐所用之組油等、但其數量僅限於工業所需、且將依照總統之意旨決定、如日本堅持在東亞從事侵略之冒險、則總統可拒絕發給出口照會、而使日本之油供應枯竭、使其工業陷於停止、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電　消息靈通之觀察家聲稱、美國禁汽車油及飛機油諭出之命令、雖未明言日本、但實係對日而發、日本之航空實可不依賴美國供給之潤滑油、目前植物油經特殊方法代替飛機油已吿成功、所消費油量之百分之九十、已有着落、故美國對油類之限制、日本將不感受立即之不便、惟美國如堅持使日本陷於困難、則時局恐將充滿危險之可能性、上述言論雖未提及荷印、但昨晚商工省大臣曾謂、國際局勢頗為緊張、星火時的燎原、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社一日渥太華電　頃據當局宣布、加拿大聯邦對於日本將採取與英·美兩國平行之經濟　置、至目下因等待特別護照、尙未能啓運之煤油、仍在擱置中、政府對之迄未採取何項行動、</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本對英美兩國不願冒決裂危險　正謀弛緩對美緊張關係 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>路透社二日東京電　過去數日中不易捉摸但非無意義之發展、表示日本現仍不願冒與英·美完全決袋之危險、日駐英大使重光葵自倫敦返國後、近衛首相第一次延見、即晤談兩小時、此項談話大概與星期三日近衛所表示對於美·德戰爭最後結果及其對日影　之疑念有關、尙有一事可注意者、為藏相小倉在日日新聞發表之論文、小倉暢言日本雖有在經濟範圍內之需要、然迄未處於有備無患可激怒英·美之地位、且自重慶美砲艦遭轟炸後、日本即趕　向美道歉、雖明知其為示懦舉動、然仍僅速為之、此事亦引起日本不敢與英·美決裂之猜測、雖　日本今固傾向軸心未嘗稍弱也、</p>
<h3 id="c3">美政府下令　凍結存絲 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　昨日出產部宣稱、自星期六午夜起、所有在美國存絲均予凍結、生產部並曾通知華盛頓之絲業工會代表謂、因遠東時局關係、彼其他公衆用品、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二日華盛頓電　美國絲織工廠七萬五千家、因政府下令禁止使用生絲、勢將完全停業、查政府之頒布此項禁令、係應海陸軍部之請求、蓋據估計、國內生絲存貨、僅敷軍需工業兩年之用、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社一日東京電　據中立國方面可靠消息、美·日兩國政府、刻正經由外交途徑進行試探、企圖覓致一種臨時辦法、以馳綏雙方緊張關係、至某種程度、參加談判者、據聞抱有兩種目標、一為經濟的、一爲政治的、關於前者、擬將現行凍結辦法通融辦理、務使太平洋沿岸各國之間、仍當恢復相當數額之貿易、關於後者、則希望覓致一種解決辦法、務使美·日關係不致再度惡化、蓋以雙方均知歐戰若果擴展至遠東、實非兩國之福也、一說美·日兩國進行此項談判、曾經通知德國、並傳美國對於經濟部份已有接受之意、果爾則英國及各同盟國亦必步其後塵、但關於政治部份、據云美·英兩國殆已切實加以反對、大抵法·日兩國最近為越南問題所成立之協定、業在英·法方面引起惡劣反響、而日本對於此項反響、似已估計太低、因此關於此事、即使他日或在事實上使之不致擴大之可能、但在法理上則決不能再經過一種外交協定予以確認、要之、凡此各點、一俟駐美大使野村之股肱若杉自美返國後、即可獲有充分情報矣、</p>

<p>路透社二日東京電　西貢日方消息云、越南領海內日艦隊司令親見新一中將、於完成運輸先頭部隊至越南各根據地後、率隊駛返西貢港內、並於今日下午訪問法屬越南艦隊司令、又據日日新聞訪電謂、日縊星期四日正式開入康瀾灣、事先日軍事使節團領袖澄田少將、曾與該海軍根據地法司令官商討開入手續、</p>
<p>路透社二日河內電　越南報紙昨忽停刊仇英文字、官塲稱、日軍依照預定計畫、陸續登陸、未遇意外事件、昨日越督德古接見前駐重慶德大使館參贊畢德博士、其人頃甫偕館員三人遵陸來此、泰國定今日完成佔領柬埔寨與老撾割讓地之手續、常接收土地時、未聞有何騷擾</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c11">美國已作第二步製裁 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>羅斯福總統一昨下令禁止飛機用汽油及潤機油運往西半球·英帝國及一切抵抗侵略國家以外的地方，即其他油產品之輸出，除上述諸地外，亦須以戰前平均數量為限；因此，日本將無法再自美國購得汽油，就是普通石油，也祇能回復到戰前的數量，再不致像過去數年的無限制取給了。此一措置，確是凍結資產之後比較澈底的制裁手段，不但可使一週來世人對於美國遠東政策的若干疑念一掃而空，且可從此把美國不斷以殺人利器供給侵略國的惡名，洗刷乾凈。</p>
<p>本來在美英宣佈凍結日本資產之後，外間頗有種種關於美日談判折衷方案及美國猶未忘情綏靖日本的傳說，美英兩國的坐視日本海陸空軍安然開入越南南部，而無所動作，更使一般人感覺失望；於是外間不是說美日之間正在談判一種「臨時辦法」，便是一味作盲目的樂觀論，相信遠東時局一時不致發生事變；實則即使退一步言，承認美國暫時無意和日本破臉，明達果決眼光遠大的羅斯福焉能不知日本是機會主義者？祇要國際形勢有機可乘，任何人皆敢斷言日本必動，何况羅斯福？就日本而言，即使承認東京政府此際還不敢過分刺激美英的情感，所以還在極力設法掩飾自己的野心，務冀不致馬上引起遠東大戰，但是囂張而猜忌，同時又迷戀着「柬亞覇業夢」的日本軍部，焉能不知英美終必干涉它的南進，因此終必有動武的一日？赤裸裸講：美國此際即使抱有若干綏靖日本的意圖，決不是眞心想結交日本，最多不過是延宕時日，以便積極在遠東完成必要的軍事佈置，集中必要的軍械配備，以備他日有效的一擊；同樣地，日本此際即使抱有若干顧忌美國的心理，也決不是眞心想和美國釋嫌言好，眞正目的，當然也在延宕時日，以便一方如日前本報所述，盡量消化其業已攫得的權益，完成其所謂高度國防與「共榮圈」，一方則佇候國際間最有利的時機，以圖　逞。準此而論，美日兩國在南太平洋上實在早已展開一種「時間爭奪戰」，雙方正各在自已的陣營中積極佈置，表面上却不獨尙未正式破臉，甚至還要故意做出一些姿態，以懈怠對方的警戒，換句話說，美日兩國在南太平洋上的衝突，早已有其必然性，唯一成為問題的，祗是爆發的時間而已，惟其雙方在正式決裂之前，都要想盡方法，在外交上，政治上，軍事上，經濟上積極準備，所以日本必然進一步征略越南，今後更必然繼續壓迫泰國，同是美國也必然在遠東方面加緊完成中英美荷菲蘇的聯防戰綫，今後關鍵，端看何方首先準備完成，或國際時局的發展先予何方以行動機會，假定日本在越南南部佈置神速，並立即取得泰國合作，或德國對蘇戰事於短時期內發生突變，日本當然不肯放鬆這種千載一時的擴展機會，反之，如果德蘇戰事繼續膠着，中英美荷的遠東聯防以及中國反攻的軍實補充早日完成，則說不定民治陣綫便會先發制人，提前解決日本。</p>
<p>總之，美日兩國的行動，目前正在一種競賽過程中，羅斯福總統的毅然禁止汽油運日，證明美國頗有爭制機先的氣概和準備，現在當然又要看日本如何還擊，大概雙方再有數次這樣一來一往的和平「交手」除非日本自承屈服，這遠東大戰的最後一慕恐怕就要搬演在即了。</p>

<p>日方採新步驟加以阻滯　烟臺學童一行無法來此</p>
<p>關於外僑從華北各埠返上海、現遇新困難事、此間日方官司員保持緘默、僅以並無所穩中有知為言、但據昨（二日）晨探悉、烟臺·青島·大連、現有大批外僑被日當局採取之步驟所阻、不能獲得返滬之便利、</p>

<p>聞日領署對於外僑欲赴青島·烟臺·與大連者、除少數特殊情形外、已完全停止簽准、昨日上海日當局未說明此新發展之原因、駐滬日大使館發言人謂、渠尚未接獲關於此事之消息、惟料不久當有所聞、</p>

<p>某外國官員答覆記者時謂、渠信日方現對外僑前往或離華北各埠所施之限制、僅係暫時辦法、華北日當局所抱堅强態度、或因英美凍結中日資金後、情勢迄今杌隉不定所致云、同時、又即華北郵件亦被日當局阻留、英當局已因此向日方交涉、</p>

<p>字林報云、本市俄文日報助理編輯特洛慈道夫、每晚七時起、在愛多亞路十七號大美電台（呼号XMHC）用俄語廣播塔斯社等所發戰事消息、頗受俄人無綫電聽衆歡迎、但昨日（一日）忽告停止、</p>
<h3 id="c45">僅报消息並不宣傳 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>據特氏聲稱、渠接電台方面通知、謂渠之播音報告、遭法警務處禁止、故已不復在大美電台廣播、但渠對法警務處此舉、頗感驚異、蓋渠逐日廣播新聞、並非宣傳、僅係播讀大多來自莫斯科之消息而已</p>

<p>上海商業儲蓄銀行之年度報告</p>
<p>上海冷商業儲蓄銀行民國二十九年度營業報告，關於國內經濟槪况略云：因連年虞亂關係，損失非淺，生產消費，在此戰事期中，一時尚無法改進。各地經濟狀况，就大體而言，尚稱平定。茲分金融，貿易，物價及工商業槪况，摘述如後：</p>
<h3 id="c50">國內金融尚稱穩定 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>國內金融，除五月間稍有波折外，尚稱穩定。金融機關，除南京業商銀行上海分行一度停業；旋即復業外，其餘各銀行，如四川，美　川鹽，各成，重慶等行，均先後增加資金。政府為穩定金融起見，公佈管理銀行辦法。至政府公債價格，幵滬莫不劇烈上騰，幾與戰前相埒，新發公債，為軍需與建設，而四行貼放委員會放款強求餘計一千二百四十萬元，而滬市全年拆息，並非特別變動。匯劃貼水，雖曾高至貼水一百五十元，其後逐步下降，已與劃頭相等。銀錢業確立新匯劃後，行之頗為便利，頗受歡迎。惟外商歐洲共同市場票之風行，足證社會對於把投機狂熱之一斑。並上海銀行因市塲游資充斥，存款數額，莫不激增，以活期性質者居多，在銀行方面，際此時機，放款出路較狹，於是相率减低利率，以輕成本。</p>
<h3 id="c51">金融事業重要措施 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>政府對於金融之重要措施，除實施管理銀行辦法外，（一）農村貨款之注意，四行及其他金融機關，在內地農村所貨長期款，共達二萬零九百萬元，其對於農村經濟之調整，堪稱有力。（二）平準會之努力，外匯平準基金鵿員會成立後，頗見努力，加以友邦之合作，匯市賴以穩定。惟中國年來對外貿易入超甚多，國際收付難以平衡，幸平準會恒視市塲情形，酌定買賣，否則匯市之變化，將更甚也。（三）新輔幣之發行，修正輔幣條例後，即由中央造幣廠開鑄該項輔幣，惟流通區域，僅限於自由中國，上深入細致　一隅發行分幣劵及　質硬幣，以應需要。（四）節約儲金之推行，公佈節約儲金條例後，各銀行積極推行，現憶逾三萬萬元，復又開辦簡易儲蓄等，吸收社會之游資，以供建國之用。</p>
<p>貿易繁盛挽救入超</p>
<p>全國對外貿易，根據海關數字，進出口總値國幣三，九九七，二六三千元。其中進口貿易為國弊二，〇二七，一四三千元，較二十八年增六九三，四八九千元。出口貿易為國幣一，九七〇，一二〇千元，較二十八年增九四二，八七四千元。入超五七，〇二二千元，較二十八年减少一四九，三八五千元。惟該項進口數字，以金單位折合國幣，海關仍按政府法定匯價換算，而出口數字，則依照外匯暗市匯率計算，尚未能表示其正確貿易情形。如進口數字亦以黑市塲之匯率計算，則進口應為為幣五，四七四，三一一千元，入超應為三，五〇四，一九〇千元，較二十八年增一三〇九，四一四千元，所以貿易之繁盛，於此可見。此偌大之進口貿易，仍以上海最多，佔百分之三七，〇九，天津次之，青島又次之。</p>
<p>工商各業方興未艾</p>
<p>各地工商業之繁榮，一如往年，要以生產消費之失調，遂成工商業之畸形發展。就上海而言，除五月問因投機失敗而倒閉清理者外，餘均獲利無算。新聞之工商行號，因無確實統計，未便加以臆斷；可得而言者，新聞者之多，實遠勝於倒閉者耳，惟類皆資本有限，規模宏大，殊不多覯。至內地工商業，亦異常發達其故由於民衆之西遷，消費量隨之增加，而運輪不便，亟籌當地之製造，凡此皆屬工商業發達之因素。政府正努力開發利源，自由中國之工商業，正方舉未艾也。</p>
<p>調整物價以安民生</p>
<p>本年度各地之物價漲勢之猛，為歷來所未有，據統計所示，去年十二月底為三七·二，至本年十二月底，竟一躍而為六一一·四。自一月至五月，逐步上升，六月至八月，稍稍回跌，九月以後，又直綫上升，與戰前一個月之比較，漲起百分之三八四·九。以建築材料類中之水泥一項，上漲為最多，因該項商品在二十八年份中漲度極微。其次為白鉛，絲，生黃生皮等。糧食一項繼續高漲，民食問題，至為嚴重，因糧食而引起其他物價之上漲。至重慶之特價，在一月至五月，倘低於上海，六月之後，時適上海回跌，而重　仍節節上進。內地生活費之增加，有增無已，當局已竭力調整，以安民生。</p>

<p>遠東局勢緩和　美棉定貸轉旺</p>
<p>現棉情况、平凡無！色、但忽良好、因海外船隻行駛缺乏、來源不湧、所以紗市雖不振、執貨未見十分惶恐、但廠方採辦甚鮮、因之棉市在此短時聞、亦是傍徨之象也、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因美棉略漲、及遠東局勢緩和、而稍有活動、一部分廠方及花號家購意轉切、昨日除現貨貿易仍屬小額之往來外、對於近期內即將抵滬之美印棉、亦有近千包左右之定成也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因華盛頓消息、所稱統制物價、不限止基本貨品而漲、投機者買進、及空頭抵補均頗不弱、但續後又因一部分獲利了結略跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲十一全十八磅音不等、</p>

<p>昨　日洋米早市開價後、期現各米一致繼漲增高、蓋前日漲風起後、一般投機米商與業外新多莫不趁機活躍、而昨日市塲中又多播散利於買方之謠言、若漲水脚阳航運加平價少訂購等、叉爲投機幫恃爲抬放之藉口、因此各米售價盡被抬高、英華司小絞漲達一百五十一元半及一百五十一元、號暹邏一百叫十二元、一號西貢一百四十八元、現小絞亦到一百十四元半、安南粳號西貢一百三十五六元、荷蘭一百四十二元、敏黨百四十一元、比之前日漲一元半二元二元半三元不等、但漲後即皮球幫獲利踢出、實銷本呆、市即被其出籠抑低一二元、結果祇轉大一元左右、成交則有現一萬六千包、英華司千三百噸、收盤若一號西買仍回至百三十二三元、二號百二十三元、百二十一元、老紅寳塔百念七元、小絞銀行棧回至百念元半、外棧百念元半、</p>

<p>證券　債息引起觀望</p>
<p>公　債暗盤、昨市爲週六祇做上午一盤、市况因補空稍多、略爲抬高、趨勢已成盤旋狀况、實賣均不甚踴躍、因本屆息要較以前各决須延迎一個月之譜、爲渝滬往還之時期、仍照向例分六個月領取、往常到年底可以領訖、此次需至三十一年一月底始克淸償、即第一期、向來七月底即可領到、此次須至八月底始能領到、在此個月之內、人心猶有猜疑、屆領款期、是吾可以得到上海通用法幣、尙在作杞人之憂天、是以人心恍惚、故市價難免盤旋耳、昨日開盤、丙種爲六十六元四角、收盤仍係原價、中間上下有三角左右上落、厚大大豐大華鴻大昌記買進、潤德怡泰震康聯和協大潤利聯益久豐等賣出、並無多大特色、亦無大量交易、結果除丁種未有做開外、餘均好起一角至四角不等、成交的一百四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>竹節鋼　俗稱水泥骨頭、亦稱水泥鋼骨、乃本街建築幫之必需品、外埠客幫經禁出口後、生涯頓感冷落、而本街亦並不多、共整個市况未許樂觀、然因同業心思扳持、行盤不致下降昨山標準如三分四分花色每噸售三千一百元、五分至一寸貨、則開三千零五十元、行情無相榮辱惟實際交易仍然淸閒、</p>
<p>白鉛皮　木爲電池廠之惟一去路、惟最近電池廠遷移、海關又告禁運、故外埠客幫去化告斷、刻市採辦者僅本街印書房鉛字作而已、躉批交易允無足述、查昨市之成父者、如三號四號五號六號七號諸花色、因問津者少，故市價難高、每桶沾四千元左右、如八號十號十二號諸貨、因有鉛字房及印刷廠之搜羅、行情所漲殊厲、每桶已由四千五百元漲至五千元光景、</p>
<p>疋頭　呢絨缺乏原料</p>
<p>木廠貨呢絨、銷路無一不旺、在目今市塲上、較之英貨爲軍耍、生產爲銷路廣暢而增加、但新近爲原料進口艱、身本昂、生產頻减、存有毛條者均寡、大半减工、祇章華怡和元豐上海等叫家、有相當毛條積存、得能照常出貨、咋由香港運來毛冷二百十一箱、人造絲五箱、</p>

<h3 id="c66">談勇敢 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>小　朋友！什麼是勇敢呢？是大着膽幹不好的事情麼？是一味不聽人家的勸告與人們爭鬥麼？不是的，這些行爲是剛愎；剛愎與勇敢是絕對不同的。剛愎是沒有理性的舉動，而勇敢是理智分明，純正無邪的行爲。換句話說。勇敢是一種犧牲一已而毫不畏縮退避的德性。</p>
<p>但是，勇敢的種類也多着呢！當國家在危難時候，做國民的一齊奪起，冒砲火爲國家盡力，這是勇敢；另外，當什麼淸發生後，第三者見義勇爲，一方面援救不幸的人，一方面擊强橫的人，這也是勇敢；再有看見有人跌入水中了，趕緊將他救起，看見老年人有困難了，趕快扶助他，這也是勇敢；更有，自己做了錯事，坦白地承認，又同時迅速地改過自新，這也是勇敢；至於用功地讀書，將來到社會上的時候，克服無窮的困難，親嘗深刻的痛苦，爲人羣謀幸福，爲自己建立不朽的偉績，這也未嘗不是勇敢！</p>
<p>所以勇敢的對象，有很參很參，只在你如何選而已！世上最可恥最可恨的人，是懦弱餒怯的人；這種人不但是人類中的廢物，而且也是社會上的害羣之馬！</p>
<p>小朋友！你自問男敢不勇敢呢？你是屬於上述幾種勇敢中那一種呢？</p>
<h3 id="c67">鄉下兒童的暑假生活 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小　朋友們，自暑假開始以後，轉眼已近一月了，你們在都市裏要知道鄕下的小朋友在暑假中，他們的生活是怎樣的嗎，這一次因爲我乘假期之暇，也在鄕間消夏？因此想把鄉下兒童的暑假生活，報告給上海的小朋友，好讓你們知道在鄕村中，兒童是怎樣度過這暑假的。</p>
<p>正和你們一樣，在暑期裹，鄉下的兒童，也有近兩個月長的假期。除了少數的兒童進暑期補習班，每天早上讀半天書，或家裏請敎師來補習外，大多數的兒童是並不讀書，把兩偭月的暑假，在不知不覺中消磨掉。</p>
<p>一天到晚不讀書，當然要找尋些事情來消遺，吾則太無聊了。在鄕下，又沒有電影院和京戲館，所以一般的兒童，祇得由自己去尋娛樂，或玩意來消遣。在這暑天時節，鄉下兒童所做玩意，最普通的怕是釣魚和捉知了哩！</p>
<p>用竹子做釣竿，把縫衣針用火燙曲了，結在綫上，一切釣魚的用具，都由孩子們自己做的。立在楊柳樹的下面，把釣鈎拴一些魚餌，如蒼蠅，米蟲等物！投到水裏，看見魚一上鈎，就把竹竿拿起，一尾活跳的魚，就釣到了。弄得好！不上半天，也可釣到幾十條魚，別有風味呢！</p>
<p>至於知了，在鄕下，到處可以看見。小朋友們用蜘蛛綱或桐油煮成的脂膠，放在竹竿上面。河濱或園子裹，看見大樹上停有知了，便把竹竿輕輕的伸上去，到那知了躱的地方，眼快手快，對準一戳，就可把知了黏住，捉得下來，帶回家去玩。</p>
<p>白天是這樣，夜一展開，聚集好多小朋友，在天井裏乘凉，講故事。高興在月亮下面，做捉迷藏，搶四角這一類玩意。也有拿了玻璃瓶，看見螢火蟲飛來，用蒲扇撲下，捉了一瓶，亮晶晶很是好看。再過幾天，促織娘，紡紗娘，蟀蟋等，都要出現，小朋友們又要忙着捉這些東西了呀！</p>
<h3 id="c68">讀「爸爸的看護者」 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>樂安小學</p>
<p>五下蔣元熙顧秋芳</p>
<p>暑　假裹，除了做老師所規定的作業以外，我們讀「愛的敎育」，咋天，我們看了一篇「爸爸的看護者」。</p>
<p>這篇故事裏的主要人物是一個意大利少年西西洛，內容是描寫他去迎接剛從外國做工回來的爸爸的一切事情。</p>
<p>他爸爸回來，還求到家中，就病在南普爾斯的醫院裹，西西洛去迎接，却認錯了一個，也是從外國做工回來的老工人，病得很重，西西洛使很週到的服侍他。</p>
<p>到西西洛發現自己的真爸爸之後，真是悲喜交集，但是他却不肯隨病愈的爸爸回去，他對爸爸說：「你看，他在那　看着我呢？我去了他是要死的」。</p>
<p>西西洛仍然一樣的服侍那老人，仍是一樣盡心看讓他，追到老人含笑的死去。</p>
<p>西西洛眞是一個好孩子，我讀了這篇文章以後，使我們的心裹也少了大大的感動，因爲像西西洛那種動人的孝心，和一切忍苦服侍不幸的病人的精神，我們那裹能做得呢？</p>
<p>所以，我們要向西西洛去學習，去孝順父母，愛講朋友，去爲世界人類服扮。</p>
<p>小朋友們，「愛的敎育」是一本最適合我們小學生讀的課外讀物，我們介紹大家看這本書，如果你們看到了好的書，也在兒童週刋上告訴我們呀！</p>
<h3 id="c69">做汽水 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>上　星期日，弟弟吃過了洋菜做的凉粉，覺得淸凉適口，今天又要求媽媽再做。媽媽說：「凉粉雖好吃，但不及汽水可以解渴袪暑，而且有益身體。我們不妨做瓶汽水喝喝，也可以換換口味啦。」</p>
<p>於是，媽媽拿了一隻有玻璃球塞的瓶子，冉預備了開水，酒石酸，重炭酸鈉（俗稱小蘇打），檸檬油和糖精等幾種原料。做時，先用酒石酸和小蘇打各五分，放在瓶內，再加入檸檬油數滴，糖精少許，然後灌入開水，急用手掩住瓶口，把它倒轉，那末玻璃球塞就堅閉瓶口了。</p>
<p>弟弟目不轉睛地瞧着媽製造，覺得很有與趣。等到媽做好後，便發問道。「這樣做成的汽水，和市上所賣的汽水是不是一模一樣？」</p>
<p>媽媽說：「汽水廠裏所製造的，不用酒石酸，而用硫酸；也有不用小蘇打而代以石粉的。再加入各種果汁，或其他的香劑，所以滋味愈加可口。而且製造的方法，不論濾水，製氣，裝瓶等手被，都利用機器，可以大量生產。」</p>
<p>過了一會，母親用力把瓶塞撳開，倒在杯裏，就有許多泡沫發生。弟弟喝着，又發問：「媽，汽水裏怎麼會牛出這麼許多泡沫的呢？」</p>
<p>媽媽回答：『因爲汽水裹所放的小蘇打，和酒石酸化合後，即發生多量的炭酸氣。瓶蓋一開，變成氣泡，立刻逸出。所以汽水倒出之後，應即時飲用，否則炭酸氣逸出，效力就少了。」</p>
<p>弟弟很詫異地問道。。「炭酸氣嗎？我聽得學校裏的老師講過，對於我們是有害的。現在我們喝汽水，呑下了許多炭酸氣，不打緊嗎？」</p>
<p>媽媽解釋道：「不錯，如果把多量的炭酸氣吸人肺內，確是有害的，甚至會窒息而死。要是它和一種飲料相混台，而呑入胃內，則因其具有酸性，反而能够消化的。」</p>
<h3 id="c70">三個「爲什麼？」 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>好　久不曾到外祖母家裏去了。於是阿亮的媽媽擇了一個陰天的下午，帶了阿　到外祖母家去拜訪。</p>
<p>外祖母家裏新近添了一隻冰箱，映入了阿亮的眼中，當時他覺得它是多麼新奇：一雙方而大的木匣子，外面漆了白漆，上面和旁邊有兩鵬門可以開關的。他好奇的把上面的蓋用力一拉，祇看見裏面有一隻凹形的洋鐵盤，下凹的地方，放着一塊長方的機器冰，四周有許多木屑圍着它；高起的洋鐵皮上有許多小孔。當他把蓋一開，一股冷氣直衝到他的面上，害他打了個寒噤。更把下面的門一開，裏面放着不少的東西，像汽水，水果等，汽水瓶上還生了不少的露珠。他看得喜出望外，今天似乎又被他發現了一件新奇的東西，可是「冰箱裏的冰爲什麼放在冰箱的上面？冰爲什麼要藏在木屑裹面？汽水瓶上爲什麼會生露珠，」阿亮一連這三個「爲什麼？」他自己當然不能把一個「爲什麼？」變成二個「因爲」，而且在外祖母家裹也沒有一個人能答覆這一個「爲什麼？」的緣故來。所以不到吃晚飯的時候，他便要求他媽媽：要回去了。</p>
<p>外祖母起先是極力的留住他母子倆在道兒吃晚飯，可是眼見得阿亮是這樣的堅持，便也不勉强的挽留了。</p>
<p>到得阿亮一踏進家門，便急去找尋他的爸爸，要請他老人家來解決這一個「爲什麼？」。</p>
<p>「第一個爲什麼冰放在冰箱的上部？因爲冰箱裏的冰能夠把它四周的空氣冷卻，但冷的空氣較生，便沉到冰箱的底部，熱的空氣較輕，更被冷空氣的下沉，驅到冰箱的上部，冰再把熱空氣冷却，再沉下來，因此空氣在冰箱裏流動起來、冰所以放在冰箱的上部，就是利用這冷空氣下沉熱空氣上升的一點上，如此能循環不息，把冰箱裏所有的空氣完全冷却。這就是第一個爲「爲什麼？」的原因。第二個爲什麼冰要藏在木屑裏？要知道夏天的溫度很高，往往在九十度左右，可是冰的溫度低，冰一到夏天很容易溶化，冰的效用也消失，所以耍把冰藏在木屑裏，這因爲木屑這樣東西不容易傳熱，便可把冰多保存一些時間，不致很決的溶解。第三個爲什麼汽水瓶上會生露珠？汽水瓶在冰箱裏時的溫度很低，一旦空氣中的水蒸氣，接觸到了這冰冷的汽水瓶，便凝結成很多的露珠。這是第三個「爲什麼？」的緣故。講到耍使冰不很快的溶解，除藏在木屑裏之外，還有一個方法：就是把鹽放在冰上，這因爲鹽和冰在一起，能使溫度更是降低，比了純粹冰的溫度還耍來得低，這樣便不容易溶化成水了。但是外祖母家的那隻冰箱裏放着木屑，實在是不對的，因爲冰在溶解的時候，吸收冰箱中的熱愛，才能使裏面的溫度降低，那才使冰的東西不致腐敗，如把冰藏在木屑裏，冰雖不溶解，箱裏的溫度當也不會降低，於是冰的東西也不能够保持新鮮了。下决你到外祖母家去，一定要把這道理告訴他們。」</p>
<p>有一位小朋朋友，他在公園裏迷失了回家的路，請諸位親愛的小朋友替他找一找吧！</p>

<p>舒繡文一離再離，難爲了丈夫！王士珍哭笑水利，有因心有果。</p>
<p>（重慶通訊），戰前，舒繡文還在明星公司充當演員時，因不滿於外子潘孑農的生活，會一度提出實行永久分居的要求，後來幸經周劍雲許幸之等從中調處，始告相安無事。但事隔未久，舒繡文忽又挽請朱斯芾律師致函其夫，要求無條件脫離夫婦關係，結果因雙方友好調處無效，於是即行</p>
<p>王式脫幅　但這事件還沒有發生多時，却傳出繡文熱戀該公司攝影師王士珍的消息。恰巧那時王因有事到漢口去，而就在這時舒繡文竟秘密追蹤到漢口，不久又雙雙轉赴香港，從此一去不返。事後，據熟悉內幕的人傳說，這完全是雙雙密謀的</p>
<p>精囊妙計　結果却也無從證實。不久，他們由香港而到了昆明等地，一面度着蜜月旅行，一面仍從事於各人本位的工作。不久復應重慶中電製片廠之邀，於是兩人叉搭機來渝，度他們美滿理想的生活。可是到渝還沒有一年，就不時傳出夫婦爭執的消息。起初友好們以爲這是夫婦間所難免的事，所以並不顧問。不料日子一久，鬧得益發厲害，甚至有二個多月各人分居着友人處，友好們</p>
<p>從中勸解　要他們言歸於好，但結果仍是沒有效力，男方竟稱妻子已另有所歡，深夜不歸；而女方却稱丈夫不顧膽養，濫交朋友，雙方都堅持着各執一詞，友好們因不能盲目判斷孰是孰非，看他們情勢似乎都異常堅決，因此也不再顧問了。最近消息傳出，知道他們確已</p>
<p>簽約離婚　了，事實就在七月四日的晚上，委託了羅企嵐律師正式簽訂離婚據，由王士珍給付女方三個月的生活費一千五百元，現在這件婚變案，總算已順利的解決，但在陪都却已鬧得滿城風雨了。有人說：電影界眞是不可思議，同時在孤島上有周嚴的婚變，陪都有舒王的婚變變，關山阻隔，而婚變却無獨有偶，電影圈裏，可算多事之秋了。李女士昨請代理人吳鏞子君來訪，說道李女士對申報讀者助學金，非常贊成，特將某種商品的廣告酬勞金四百元，再自加一百元，而以三百金助學，二百金捐難童敎養院，爲「救救孩子」盡了一點責任。我聽了大爲感動!她道可敬的慈幼心腸，爲影人首倡，一定可以推動影圈內外人士的同情。「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，李女士能體會古人的美德，而身體力行，値得佩服，書此誌謝。（編者）右圖爲李女士新影，郁熊卿攝。</p>

<p>張蒼虬：「豈敢豈敢。俺也無日不思賢弟與李三弟爲什麼他沒有和你一同來呢？貴鄉地方安謐嗎？」許靖嘆口氣說道：「我等雖然分別不久，而其中已是大有滄桑，足爲感喟呢。」便將張蒼虬陳飛離開杞縣後的情狀，從靑石山土匪紅娘子攻城，李信被據，以及自己投軍代州，血戰寗武，幷和柳隱英如何結識的經過，很簡略地奉告一遍。張蒼虬和陳飛坐在一旁聽，忽而大笑，忽而哀嘆，忽而手舞足蹈，忽而痛哭流涕。允其對於周遇吉將軍的死守寗武，殺身成仁，感動到極點了。末後許靖又把自己和柳隱英來此投奔的志願，略述一下，且欲託張陳二位進言於吳總兵，收錄帳下。張蒼虬點點頭道：「這事情在俺身上一定可以成功，現在正是用人之秋，難得二位來此，正可截力同心，共扶王室。不過吳總兵不在此間，柴英游擊亦未便作主。稍待數天，吳總兵便要回來，再當介紹進謁。」許靖道：「有謝二兄費力了。「張蒼虬又道：「賢弟和這位許君遠道來此，必然鞍馬勞頓，要休息一下，此地不便暢叙，且請二位隨俺到營房中去坐坐，待俺和二弟預備一些酒菜，爲二位洗鏖。」許靖並不客氣，說道：「很好很好。」張蒼虬陳飛遂叉引着二人離了總兵衙門，走回東城營房裏來。他們的營房是在玄壇廟的背後，建造已久，房屋半新半舊，挿着許多旗幟，營門口有守卒站着，外觀也很雄壯嚴肅。張蒼虬陳飛陪二人進了營門，却從左邊小徑裏繞道走到他們私下休坐之處，是一間很明暢的屋子，陳設雖然簡陋，地方也還淸潔。張蒼虬請許靖柳隱英在椅子裏坐下，他就喚過一名馬弁，敎他去端整酒肴。　（一三二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">US President Issues Special Order Banning Oil Exports: Most Severe Blow to Japan Since the Start of the War; Petroleum Products Limited to Peacetime Export Levels <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 1st – President Roosevelt issued an order this evening banning the export of all motor fuel oil and various oils suitable for aircraft to countries outside the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of the British Empire and the unoccupied areas of other countries resisting aggression. Although Japan was not mentioned in the order, authoritative sources told reporters that the President's ban was clearly aimed at Japan and would be the most severe blow to Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The government's policy on gasoline exports to Japan has reached its peak with the publication of this order, and public opinion across the United States is generally satisfied.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Without any prior special announcement, Japan will no longer be able to obtain machine oil and aircraft oil from the United States. President Roosevelt has banned the export of all machine oil and various oils usable in aircraft, as well as all raw materials for machine oil, to foreign countries, except for the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and the unoccupied countries resisting aggression. Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, expressed great satisfaction with Roosevelt's move. Dr. Hu Shih stated, "I believe this action will strengthen our morale and will be of great benefit to democratic countries fighting for freedom." Previously, all exports of American aircraft oil and machine oil required export licenses, but now they are all under control. The White House announcement stated, "President Roosevelt has instructed the Export Control Administrator to begin implementing a ban on gasoline exports for the sake of national defense. This action will have two effects: (1) The export of machine fuel, oils suitable for aircraft, and certain oil-producing raw materials will be prohibited to areas outside the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and other unoccupied countries resisting aggression. (2) The export of other gasoline production, except to the above-mentioned areas, will be limited to regular or pre-war quantities, and notes will be issued proportionally."</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – President Roosevelt yesterday implemented a de facto embargo on all motor fuel and lubricating oil to Japan. Authoritative sources here believe this is another blow to Japan's war machine. Although the U.S. President's move was clearly aimed at Japan, it did not mention Japan by name. The U.S. President's special order mandates that the current embargo on aviation fuel and oil must be implemented strictly, and a mechanism will be established to implement embargoes on all other types of gasoline and oil at will. Therefore, when it is deemed necessary to impose an absolute embargo, Japan's remaining oil supply will be cut off immediately. A spokesman for the administration declared that the motive for this order was based on reliable information that German and Japanese bombers were using inferior aviation gasoline, even lower than what the U.S. President had already embargoed. Roosevelt will continue to allow oil shipments to Japan to maintain its non-military industries, that is, to limit the export of other petroleum products to the normal quantities before the war, and export notes must be issued. An export administration spokesman said that Japan and other designated countries can obtain special oils, such as group oils used in stoves, but the quantity is limited to industrial needs and will be determined according to the President's wishes. If Japan insists on engaging in aggressive adventures in East Asia, the President can refuse to issue export notes, thereby depleting Japan's oil supply and bringing its industry to a standstill.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Well-informed observers claim that the U.S. order banning the export of automobile and aircraft oil, although not explicitly mentioning Japan, is in fact aimed at Japan. Japan's aviation industry can depend on something other than the lubricating oil supplied by the United States. Currently, vegetable oil has been successfully used to replace aircraft oil through special methods, accounting for 90% of the oil consumption. Therefore, Japan will not feel immediate inconvenience from the U.S. restrictions on oil. However, if the United States insists on putting Japan in difficulty, the situation may be fraught with dangerous possibilities. Although the above remarks did not mention the Dutch East Indies, the Minister of Commerce and Industry stated last night that the international situation is quite tense, and even a spark could ignite a prairie fire.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 1st (Havas) – It was recently announced by the authorities that the Canadian Federation will take economic measures parallel to those of Britain and the United States against Japan. Kerosene that has not yet been shipped due to waiting for special passports is still being shelved, and the government has not yet taken any action on it.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Does Not Wish to Risk Rupture with Britain and the United States; Is Seeking to Ease Tensions with the United States <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Subtle but not meaningless developments in the past few days indicate that Japan is still unwilling to risk a complete rupture with Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Koki Hirota, after returning from London, met with Prime Minister Konoe for the first time for two hours. This conversation was probably related to Konoe's doubts expressed on Wednesday about the final outcome of the U.S.-German war and its impact on Japan. Another noteworthy matter is the essay published by Finance Minister Ogura in the Nikkan Shimbun. Ogura stated plainly that although Japan has needs in the economic sphere, it is not yet in a position to provoke Britain and the United States without preparedness. Moreover, after the bombing of the U.S. gunboat in Chongqing, Japan quickly apologized to the United States, even though it knew it was an act of weakness, it still did so quickly. This also raises speculation that Japan does not dare to break with Britain and the United States, although Japan's inclination towards the Axis powers has not weakened in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="e3">US Government Orders Freeze on Silk Stocks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that all silk stocks in the United States will be frozen from midnight on Saturday. The Department of Commerce also notified representatives of the silk industry union in Washington that due to the situation in the Far East, they could no longer compete with the military in the supply of silk for public use.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas) – Seventy-five thousand American silk weaving factories will be completely shut down due to the government's order prohibiting the use of raw silk. The government issued this ban at the request of the Departments of the Army and Navy. It is estimated that domestic raw silk stocks are only sufficient for two years of military and industrial use.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Havas) – According to reliable sources in neutral countries, the governments of the United States and Japan are currently conducting explorations through diplomatic channels, attempting to find a temporary solution to ease tensions between the two sides to some extent. Participants in the negotiations are said to have two goals: one economic and one political. Regarding the former, it is proposed to flexibly manage the current freeze measures to ensure that a considerable amount of trade between countries along the Pacific coast can still be restored. Regarding the latter, it is hoped to find a solution to prevent the relationship between the United States and Japan from deteriorating again, as both sides know that if the European war were to expand to the Far East, it would not be beneficial to either country. It is said that the United States and Japan notified Germany of these negotiations, and it is rumored that the United States has already accepted the economic part. If so, Britain and its allies will inevitably follow suit. However, it is said that the United States and Britain have firmly opposed the political part. In general, the agreement recently reached between France and Japan on the Vietnam issue has caused a bad reaction in Britain and France, and Japan seems to have underestimated this reaction. Therefore, regarding this matter, even if there is a possibility of preventing it from expanding in fact in the future, it can never be confirmed through a diplomatic agreement in law. In short, all these points can be fully understood once Mr. Wakasugi, the right-hand man of Ambassador Nomura to the United States, returns from the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Troops Continuously Arriving in Vietnam; Japanese Warships Also in Cam Ranh Bay <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Saigon, 2nd (United Press) – A Japanese cruiser arrived here this morning for a visit of several days. Since Tuesday, Japanese transport ships have been arriving here in a steady stream. Japanese troops are being transported to their barracks by truck and are not patrolling the streets of the city. Japanese troops have brought in large quantities of gasoline and large bombs. Japanese military aircraft are parked at the airport because the hangars cannot fully accommodate them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – Saigon Japanese sources say that Vice Admiral Niimi, commander of the Japanese fleet in Vietnamese territorial waters, after completing the transport of the vanguard to various bases in Vietnam, led his team back to Saigon harbor and visited the commander of the French Vietnamese fleet this afternoon. According to the Nikkan Shimbun, the Japanese army officially entered Cam Ranh Bay on Thursday. Prior to this, Major General Sumida, leader of the Japanese military delegation, had discussed the entry procedures with the French commander of the naval base.</p>
<p>Hanoi, 2nd (Reuters) – Vietnamese newspapers suddenly stopped publishing anti-British articles yesterday. Officials say that Japanese troops are landing one after another according to the planned schedule, without any unexpected incidents. Yesterday, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux received Dr. Biitt, a former counselor at the German embassy in Chongqing, who recently arrived here by land with three embassy staff members. Thailand is scheduled to complete the handover of the ceded territories of Cambodia and Laos today. There have been no reports of disturbances during the handover of the land.</p>
<h3 id="e5">It is rumored that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have established an agreement: If necessary, they will jointly restrain Japan; Britain will declare war if the Dutch East Indies are attacked <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (International News Service) – Well-informed sources here said yesterday that China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have reached an agreement on actions to be taken in the event of a Japanese advance to the south. The details of the agreement are kept secret, but it is understood that according to the terms of the agreement, if the four countries are jointly involved in a war against Japan, they will unanimously impose economic sanctions on Japan and mutually use naval and military bases. President Roosevelt met with British Ambassador to the United States Halifax yesterday to discuss plans for Britain and the United States to intensify economic sanctions against Japan if Japan encroaches on Thailand. It is said that Britain is rushing to build airfields and fortifications on the Malay Peninsula day and night to prevent Singapore from being attacked by land from Thailand. Washington believes that if Japan attacks the Dutch East Indies, Britain will immediately declare war on it. It is also said that the United States has assured the Dutch East Indies that if they are attacked, the United States will immediately provide assistance. The nature and scope of assistance have not been announced because they are military secrets.</p>

<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – The Navy yesterday took over the personnel, equipment, and all activities of the coastal defense of the Honolulu area (14th District) until the crisis is over.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (International News Service) – The U.S. Navy announced yesterday that the Cavite and Sangley Point naval air stations in the Philippines will begin operations on September 1. Others on Johnston Island and Palmyra Island are scheduled to be activated on August 5.</p>
<p>Manila, 2nd (United Press) – President Quezon today summoned ten infantry brigades with 15,000 men to be enlisted into the U.S. Army from September 1. This action was taken at the request of Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the U.S. Far East Command. This is the first batch of Filipino troops to be enlisted into the U.S. Army, the first batch being the Air Force from August 15.</p>

<p>London, 2nd (United Press) – Authoritative sources here said yesterday that a large amount of air force reinforcements, including American-made Brewster Buffalo fighters, have arrived in Burma. The British Air Force there is preparing to defend this strategically important Far East base. General Brooke-Popham, commander of the British Far East Command, said that if the war spreads to Manila, Burma can launch aircraft to fight within a few hours due to the arrival of large numbers of reinforcements, and it already has the most suitable aircraft. Authoritative sources said that in the past few days, countless men and women from the Shan states have been clearing grass and trees and building airfields in the area along the coast and the Thai border. The various airfields from Lashio to Momeik in the northern part of Burma are also being built by them. It is said that most of the airfields being built have been completed and are well-equipped for heavy bombers to take off.</p>

<p>Batavia, 2nd (Reuters) – Japanese sources say that the Dutch East Indies is temporarily not issuing licenses for goods shipped to Japan. It is said that the licensing system announced last week has placed all trade with Japan under government control, including deliveries stipulated in oil agreements. Van Mook, the Dutch East Indies Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the issuance of export licenses is based on the situation in the Pacific. He made no predictions about the possible actions of the Dutch East Indies government in the near future.</p>

<p>London, 2nd (United Press) – Reliable sources here said yesterday in an exchange of telegrams from Laos and Angorvent Province that Japan is demanding a formal monopoly on Thai trade, including rubber, tin, and the use of Thai naval, land, and air force bases. According to reports, Thailand previously obtained Laos and Angorvent from Vietnam through Japan's mediation.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (United Press) – It was believed here yesterday that the rumor that Japan was demanding additional Vietnamese territory in exchange for Thai naval and air bases was the result of overly lenient economic sanctions against Japan by civilized countries. On the other hand, Tokyo's rapid apology and promise of compensation for the bombing of the American warship, as well as the guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future, indicate that Japan is making every effort to avoid unnecessary provocations against the United States. A small group of experts here believe that Japan is now clearly attempting to expand its influence to Thailand, and Konoe will continue his southward advance despite the threat of embargoes, as he believes that embargoes are inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="e11">The United States Takes the Second Step in Sanctions <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday banning the transport of aircraft gasoline and lubricating oil to places outside the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, and all countries resisting aggression. The export of other oil products, except to the above-mentioned areas, must also be limited to the average amount before the war. Therefore, Japan will no longer be able to purchase gasoline from the United States, and even ordinary oil will only be able to return to pre-war quantities, and will no longer be able to be supplied without restriction as in the past few years. This measure is indeed a more thorough sanctioning measure after the freezing of assets. It can not only sweep away some doubts about the United States' Far East policy in the world for the past week, but also completely cleanse the United States' evil reputation of constantly supplying instruments of murder to aggressor countries.</p>
<p>Originally, after the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets, there were various rumors about a compromise plan for negotiations between the United States and Japan and that the United States still had not forgotten its appeasement of Japan. The United States and Britain's watching the Japanese navy, army, and air force safely enter southern Vietnam without taking any action made people feel disappointed. Thus, the outside world was either saying that the United States and Japan were negotiating a "temporary solution," or blindly optimistic, believing that nothing would happen to the Far Eastern situation for the time being. In fact, even if we take a step back and admit that the United States has no intention of breaking with Japan for the time being, how could Roosevelt, who is wise, decisive, and far-sighted, not know that Japan is an opportunist? As long as the international situation is exploitable, anyone dares to assert that Japan will move, let alone Roosevelt? As far as Japan is concerned, even if it is admitted that the Tokyo government does not dare to excessively stimulate the emotions of the United States and Britain at this time, and is therefore doing its best to conceal its ambitions, hoping not to immediately cause a Far Eastern war, how can the arrogant, suspicious, and at the same time infatuated with the "Pan-Asian hegemony dream" Japanese military not know that Britain and the United States will eventually interfere with its southward advance, and therefore there will eventually be a day of armed force? Frankly speaking, even if the United States has some intention of appeasing Japan at this time, it is not sincerely trying to befriend Japan. At most, it is delaying the day so that it can actively complete the necessary military arrangements in the Far East and concentrate the necessary armaments in preparation for an effective strike in the future. Similarly, even if Japan has some psychological misgivings about the United States at this time, it is not sincerely trying to dispel suspicion and make peace with the United States. The real purpose is, of course, also to delay the day so that, on the one hand, as this newspaper reported the other day, it can digest the rights and interests it has already seized as much as possible, complete its so-called high defense and "co-prosperity sphere," and on the other hand, wait for the most favorable opportunity in the international situation to achieve its ambitions. On this basis, the United States and Japan have already launched a "time competition" in the South Pacific. Both sides are actively deploying in their own camps, but on the surface, they have not only not officially broken up, but even deliberately make some gestures to slacken the other side's vigilance. In other words, the conflict between the United States and Japan in the South Pacific has long been inevitable. The only question is when it will erupt. However, before the two sides officially break up, they must try their best to actively prepare diplomatically, politically, militarily, and economically. Therefore, Japan will inevitably further conquer Vietnam, and will inevitably continue to put pressure on Thailand in the future. At the same time, the United States will inevitably step up the completion of the joint defense line of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union in the Far East. In the future, the key depends on which side is the first to prepare for completion, or which side the development of the international situation first gives the opportunity to act. Assuming that Japan's deployment in southern Vietnam is rapid and it immediately obtains Thailand's cooperation, or that a sudden change occurs in Germany's war against the Soviet Union in a short period of time, Japan will of course not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for expansion. Conversely, if the German-Soviet war continues to be deadlocked and the military supplement for the Far East joint defense of China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, as well as the Chinese counter-offensive, is completed early, it is possible that the democratic camp will take the lead and resolve Japan ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>In short, the actions of the United States and Japan are currently in a race. President Roosevelt's resolute ban on gasoline transportation to Japan proves that the United States has the courage and preparation to compete for the initiative. Now, of course, we have to see how Japan counterattacks. Probably after several more rounds of such peaceful "hand-to-hand combat" between the two sides, unless Japan admits defeat, the final scene of this Far Eastern war is likely to be staged soon.</p>
<p>US and Soviet Union Discuss Far East Military Cooperation; Vladivostok May Be Available for US Use; Tokyo Expresses Anxiety</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) – The Social Democratic newspaper published here reported from London that Hopkins does not intend to discuss measures on how the United States will assist the Soviet Union with the Soviet authorities, so this matter will be negotiated by the new Soviet representative arriving in the United States in the United States. Hopkins intends to negotiate to hope that Stalin will allow the United States to use certain air force and naval bases in the Soviet Union. It has been learned that the Soviet government may allow the United States to use Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated today that Japan must pay close attention to the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in the Far East, because it may lead to the Soviet Union and the United States concluding a military agreement to surround Japan. The newspaper said that the United States' approval of transporting large amounts of oil to the Soviet Union, that is, deciding to transport it through the Pacific Ocean, shows that the United States no longer cares about Japan's feelings for the Three-Power Alliance. The newspaper also said that the United States' transportation of oil to the Soviet Union is in exchange for obtaining a base in Kamchatka, so as to connect with Alaska, so as to transport troops through the Aleutian Islands.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Foreign Minister Guo Receives Reporters, Discusses International Situation, Opposes Appeasement of Japan - Japan's Southern Advance Policy Has Been Determined, Britain and the United States Must Intensify Economic Sanctions <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi stated this morning while receiving reporters that global attention is now focused on Thailand, because Japan has not only advanced into Thailand but has also entered Thai territory. Recent indications are that Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo was the result of Japanese coercion. We have always held a hope that Thailand would resist Japanese aggression, as the fate of its neighbor Vietnam should serve as a warning to Thailand. However, Thailand has now accepted Japanese control, which is deeply regrettable. Thailand's actions not only concern China but also other countries in the Pacific, which have expressed their dissatisfaction with Japan's aggression in Vietnam through economic sanctions. When asked whether China will take retaliatory action against Thailand, Guo replied that the Chinese government has not yet received official confirmation of Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo. Although it is known that if Thailand takes this action, it will be entirely due to Japanese coercion, the Chinese government is currently considering this issue. Foreign Minister Guo expressed his satisfaction with the economic sanctions imposed by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India on Japan, stating that the parallel and coordinated measures of Britain and the United States are in line with China's repeated desire for closer cooperation to sanction aggressor nations. This move is not only a major blow to Japan but also clarifies the international situation. In the first two years of the War of Resistance, China was in a special position, receiving some assistance from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but fighting alone and unaided. Not only that, but other countries also had a tendency to avoid provoking Japan and to appease it. The current economic sanctions are the first direct action taken by other countries against Japan. When asked about President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, coming to Chongqing, Foreign Minister Guo replied that he has not yet received official news. If Hopkins does come, China will certainly welcome him warmly. Foreign Minister Guo also stated that all German and Italian diplomatic and consular personnel and expatriates have left the country. However, clergymen of German and Italian nationality may continue to reside in China if their activities do not go beyond the scope of church affairs and they abide by Chinese law. Foreign Minister Guo also vehemently opposed adopting a policy of appeasement toward Japan. If the economic measures recently adopted by Britain and the United States are to achieve their intended purpose, they must be strengthened. The economic noose around Japan's neck must be tightened sooner or later, and the sooner the better. As for the fear that a complete embargo might trigger an immediate Japanese attack on the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, this is unfounded. If Japan had the strength to advance south, it would certainly do so, regardless of whether there is an embargo or not. It must be understood that time is on Japan's side. Any attempt to prolong the situation will only benefit the Japanese, as their future actions may be determined by the progress of the Soviet-German war and developments in the Near East. Japan's policy has already been decided. The only question is the timing of its next move. As for whether Japan will attack north or advance south, there is little difference. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Guo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed the current international situation at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the morning of the 2nd. Guo first stated that regarding the Thailand issue, all parties are paying close attention. According to the current situation, Japan's aggressive blade is not only pointing at Thailand but has also penetrated the heart of Thailand. Therefore, Thailand is clearly under Japanese control. Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo is also clear evidence of Japanese violent oppression. Guo continued, stating that the fate of European small countries struggling to maintain neutrality or throwing themselves into the arms of the Axis powers under the war can serve as a strong warning to Thailand. In particular, Vietnam's result of surrender is even more of a lesson for Thailand. This situation not only raises major concerns in China but also has a great impact on all countries related to the Pacific. Guo then mentioned the economic sanctions taken by Britain, the United States, and India after Japan's southern advance, stating that these measures have proved the parallel actions of Britain in the Pacific. This development is highly consistent with China's overall policy. China has consistently adhered to the policy that anti-aggressors should unite and defend themselves. Therefore, from China's standpoint, the economic sanctions taken by Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India are gratifying. This not only forms a major striking force against Japan but also allows the international situation to be thoroughly clarified. You all know that China is the vanguard of anti-aggression. Although China has obtained moral sympathy and material assistance from general democratic countries in the past four years of warfare, strictly speaking, China has always fought on its own. Recently, when the Vietnam issue occurred and various democratic countries in the South Pacific were threatened by strict military power, there was still a tendency to appease Japan until the announcement of the policy of freezing funds was implemented and the United States began to take active measures, which was a further step in the US anti-aggression policy and also the first time that the United States used the same policy to deal with China's enemy Japan as it did with Britain's enemy. Therefore, the anti-aggression front became increasingly clear and consolidated. Regarding the question of Japan's future moves (southward or northward), Guo stated in a very firm tone that "I believe, and Japanese public opinion also recognizes, that Japan's southern advance issue is inseparable from the so-called 'China Incident'. What I want to particularly draw attention to today is not the issue of Japan's movements but the issue of Japan's intensified cooperation with the Axis powers. This is a major decision from Japan's previous meeting. For example, after the reorganization of the Konoe cabinet, the resignation of Foreign Minister Matsuoka was probably also the result of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. In short, Japan's basic policy has been determined. When it will launch depends on the evolution of the international situation." When Foreign Minister Guo reached this point, a reporter asked what countermeasures the Chinese government would take regarding Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo. Guo replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received an official report. If it is true, the government will consider response measures. Also, regarding the issue of economic sanctions against Japan, Foreign Minister Guo replied to a foreign reporter that the economic sanctions taken by Britain and the United States have already been implemented. This method is like a (noose around the neck). I am very gratified that Britain and the United States are implementing this policy, but it seems that there is still room for improvement in the implementation of this policy. Frankly speaking, I cannot agree with this, because Japan's policy has always been conspiratorial and has never changed its purpose, not only to invade China but also to launch fierce attacks on other countries in the Pacific. I dare to believe that this conspiracy will soon be put into action. Guo continued, stating that Japan's economic destiny is completely in the hands of democratic countries. This is almost undoubtedly a fact. Therefore, Japan's economy will inevitably be brought to death one day, but I personally believe that Japan is the weakest link in the Axis powers. At this opportunity, the economic noose that Britain and the United States have placed on Japan's neck should be tightened. I believe that this action will be more effective the faster it is. Subsequently, a foreign reporter asked whether the United States' total embargo would cause Japan to attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. Foreign Minister Guo replied, "I can frankly tell you that if Japan's strength is fully prepared, any compromise policy cannot stop its southern advance. Therefore, in order to avoid Japan gaining sufficient time, democratic countries should preemptively strike; otherwise, the longer the disaster is delayed, the deeper it will become." Guo continued, stating that our envoys in Germany and Italy, as well as students and expatriates, have mostly set out to return home one after another. There is still a small part remaining in Germany and Italy, preparing to withdraw. As for the missionaries from Germany and Italy in China, they have not withdrawn. If their activities are within the legitimate scope of missionary work, they should be protected. Yesterday, Bishop Yu Bin also visited me on behalf of Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Representative to China, and expressed gratitude for the Chinese government's attitude. A foreign reporter asked again whether Foreign Minister Guo was prepared to welcome Hopkins to Chongqing. Guo smiled and said, "If Mr. Hopkins comes to China, I will of course welcome him wholeheartedly, but I have not yet received news of Mr. Hopkins coming to China." Finally, Foreign Minister Guo stated that the weekly press conference will still be attended by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Ministry, and I will personally attend every few weeks.

<h3 id="e31">Eastern Front Battles for Six Weeks - Red Army Holds Dominant Position - German Infantry Division Annihilated in Central Region - Nazi Army Reorganizes for Another Effort <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>United Press, London, 2nd - Today, well-informed military observers here, at the end of the sixth week of the Soviet-German war, all said that the fighting on the Eastern Front has become the initiative of the Soviet army, and the German army is passive. According to reliable news and official communiqués from Germany and the Soviet Union, experts believe that the fact that there has been no change in the front line in the past few days is enough to show that these two major combat armies have entered a decisive war, and the Soviet army has gradually gained an advantage. The experts estimate that the Soviet army's mobilization has now been practically completed. The manpower and materials of these two major opposing armies have formed a match, but the Soviet army's supply lines and transportation are better than the German army, and the manpower reserved for unused is also more than the German army. Therefore, these experts believe that the position now held by the Soviet army is more advantageous. Although the German Air Force has inflicted heavy losses on the rear of the Red Army, it is still easier for the Soviet army to mobilize huge amounts of personnel, use huge amounts of ammunition and gasoline than the German army. In view of the systematic burning of transportation money and military supplies by the Soviet army during its retreat, and the continued use of encirclement strategies to harass the rear of the German army, these experts believe that German reinforcements and military supplies must have become a strict military problem at this time.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - Today's Soviet communiqué is slightly different from those released in the previous few days, stating that the Soviet army has defeated the German 137th Infantry Division in the Smolensk region. Last night, there were continued fierce battles in the Smolensk, Novo-Zhichev, Nevel, and Zhytomyr regions, but there were no large-scale wars in other places. Soviet aircraft continued to attack German troops on all routes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a recent communiqué stating that yesterday there was fighting all day in the Pokov, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr regions, but there were no major changes on the front lines. The Soviet Air Force continued to strike enemy motorized infantry and enemy aircraft at airfields, and sank one enemy patrol boat and one oil tanker of 5,000 tons in the Baltic Sea, and severely damaged four other enemy ships. On July 31, fifteen German aircraft were shot down in air battles, and the Soviet army lost seven aircraft. A Soviet team commanded by Tai Qingke completely defeated a German regiment, leaving 500 German corpses, capturing many enemy troops, and seizing six tanks, two armored vehicles, nine artillery pieces, eight machine guns, eight trucks loaded with shells, eighteen automobiles, fifty motorcycles, and other war trophies.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 2nd - Yesterday's combined report from the front lines stated that Germany has been contained after six weeks of great war. It is currently heard that the German army is reorganizing, attempting a third decisive major assault against Soviet resistance. Soviet sources also did not mention Nazi great victories on the Eastern Front. Sources in London said that there has been no change on the front line in the past 24 hours, but warned not to assume that the front line has become stable. A Soviet spokesman in Moscow also issued the same warning.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - Berlin military officials declared yesterday afternoon that after the most intense annihilation war by the German army south of Smolensk against the surrounded Soviet army, 35,000 Soviet troops have been captured, and the battlefields are full of enemy corpses. The Soviet army also lost 250 large and small artillery pieces. The German army has recently intensified its pressure on the surrounded Soviet army. The Soviet army's several attempts to break out failed, resulting in heavy casualties. German artillery and aircraft continued to bombard fiercely, and the shells rained down, causing the Soviet army to be immersed in a sea of fire. The German army finally solved it with assault teams followed by infantry to attack the Soviet army. The surrounded Soviet army northeast of Smolensk also attempted to break out on July 31 but failed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - The "People's Observer" today reviewed the German army's war on the Eastern Front, stating that the German war against the Soviet Union has lasted for six weeks so far, and the German army has penetrated 800 kilometers into Soviet territory. The German army is continuing to advance rapidly on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Havana News Agency, a Certain Place on the German Border, 1st - The great battle in the Smolensk region in the central route has lasted for several days. As a result of the Red Army's fierce counterattack, the German army has had to fight both inside and outside the encirclement line at the same time. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, and it is still difficult to determine who will win, but it can be said that the battle has reached a decisive juncture. The situation on the southern route is also the same. Although the German-Romanian joint forces claim to have crossed the lower reaches of the Dniester River, the actual strength of the Red Army there is still unknown, and a major battle is bound to unfold. On the northern route, the Red Army authorities claim to be counterattacking in the Pokhov and Novo-Riev regions, attempting to threaten the German army's flanks at Lake Ilmen, but the key to the northern battlefield, the siege of Leningrad, has not yet been lifted. Eight divisions of the Red Army in the region are trapped in an encirclement. According to German claims, since the start of the war, the German army has occupied an average of 10,000 square miles per day, and the occupied area is now larger than Germany's mainland.</p>

<p>Reuter's dispatch from the Argentine capital, dated the 2nd.</p>
<p>Following the publication of its investigation report by the Argentine Congressional Committee investigating Axis activities, Argentine congressmen may advocate severing diplomatic relations with Germany. The committee chairman, Taibo Da, told reporters yesterday that he knew that some congressmen would propose severing ties with Germany, as it has now been confirmed that Axis activities exist and are spreading widely. This is greatly detrimental to the integrity of the nation and its institutions. All those participating in these activities despise everything Argentine, and their activities can be regarded as hostile acts. It is reported that the Argentine government has asked the German ambassador to explain why a wireless radio was found in the luggage of a member of the embassy staff last week, as wireless radios are not permissible items in the luggage of diplomats.</p>
<p>Reuter's dispatch from Washington, dated the 2nd. Germany, believing that the United States' inclusion of certain merchants in Latin America on the "Black List" hinders the neutrality of Latin American countries, asked Mexico to protest to the United States. Mexico has now sternly rejected this request. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Welles commented on the matter yesterday, denouncing Germany's brazenness, saying that Germany has already undermined the sovereignty of many countries, and now it is advising Mexico or other countries to safeguard their sovereignty, which is truly shameless. In fact, Mexico needs no advice from Germany.</p>

<p>United Press dispatch from New York, dated the 2nd. News arrived yesterday from various European capitals that serious chaos, strikes, and guerrilla activity are occurring in Norway, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania, which are occupied by Germany and Italy.

United Press has monitored a Moscow radio broadcast stating that Germany has dispatched 40,000 special police officers to Yugoslavia, where guerrillas are attacking Nazi troops, destroying bridges, and setting fire to armories. The radio station cited a Pravda report stating that "80,000 Serbians have been eliminated for anti-German activities" in the three months of German occupation of Yugoslavia. News from the Swedish capital stated that a state of emergency has been declared on the northern coast of Norway due to strikes and large-scale anti-German demonstrations.

According to a crew member, the only exciting event they encountered en route was the escort ships speeding around and dropping depth charges.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Many Foreigners Unable to Return to Shanghai Due to Obstruction in Various Parts of North China <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side Adopts New Measures to Obstruct; Group of Yantai Students Unable to Come Here</p>
<p>Regarding the return of foreigners from various ports in North China to Shanghai, new difficulties have arisen. Japanese officials here remain silent, saying only that they have no knowledge of the matter. However, according to inquiries made this morning (the 2nd), a large number of foreigners in Yantai, Qingdao, and Dalian are being obstructed by measures taken by the Japanese authorities and are unable to obtain the convenience of returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Qingdao and Dalian Not Approving Visas <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the Japanese consulates have completely stopped approving visas for foreigners wishing to go to Qingdao, Yantai, and Dalian, except in a few special circumstances. Yesterday, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai did not explain the reason for this new development. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai said that he had not yet received any news about the matter but expected to hear something soon.</p>
<h3 id="e38">This Move May Be a Temporary Measure <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>A foreign official told reporters that he believed that the restrictions currently imposed by the Japanese side on foreigners traveling to or leaving ports in North China are only temporary measures. The strong attitude adopted by the Japanese authorities in North China may be due to the unstable situation since the British and Americans froze Sino-Japanese funds. At the same time, mail to and from North China is also being detained by the Japanese authorities. The British authorities have already made representations to the Japanese side regarding this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Restrictions on Foreigners Traveling to Japan Still in Place <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>According to news this morning, the restrictions previously imposed by the Japanese side on approving visas for foreigners traveling to Japan have not yet been lifted. An official at the Japanese Embassy said that he was unaware of any changes regarding the approval of visas for foreigners traveling to Japan. The reason why foreigners leaving Shanghai on the Japanese ship Nitta Maru were able to obtain visas was that the ship was originally scheduled to sail to the United States. In addition, the restrictions that began about two weeks ago have not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Yantai Students Prevented from Coming to Shanghai <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to a telegram received in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), the Japanese side is currently not allowing any foreigners to leave Yantai, for reasons unknown, and mail is also being detained. It is reported that the British Consulate in that port has received appeals from British expatriates and is making representations to the Japanese authorities. If the Japanese side does not relax this prohibition before August 6, then a group of students from the Yantai school run by the China Inland Mission, who are scheduled to depart for Shanghai on that day, may have to postpone their trip. In addition, other foreigners who plan to leave Yantai for Tianjin will also be unable to travel. It is reported that some of the students scheduled to come to Shanghai from Yantai on August 6 have already purchased tickets for the American President liner scheduled to sail from Shanghai in mid-August. If the Japanese side continues to disallow foreigners from leaving Yantai, then the parents of these students in Shanghai will face major inconvenience. According to what can be confirmed as of yesterday, the Japanese side's prohibition on foreigners leaving Yantai has no excuse such as quarantine, and Shanghai has never received any news of infectious diseases in Yantai.</p>

<p>Citizens Should Be Careful with Their Diet and Daily Life</p>
<p>More cases of true cholera have recently been discovered in this city. According to the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, in the past week, the hospital has examined patients confirmed to have true cholera, including: Sun Zhu Shi, residing at No. 31 Junji Lane, Xinjiang Road, from Jiangbei; Sun Da Mao, residing with Sun Zhu Shi, from Jiangbei; Ji Cai Feng, residing at No. 576 Dexing Lane, Haining Road, from Ningbo; A Er, residing at No. 21 Songtong Lane, junction of Qipu Road and Shanxi Road, from Jiangbei; and Li A Si, residing at No. 54 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road, from Jiangbei. Among them, three people have already recovered, and the remaining two are still receiving saline injections for treatment. At a time when epidemics are prevalent, citizens must be extra careful about their daily life and diet.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Russian Youth Party Vows Allegiance to the Motherland <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Speech, Beliefs, Confidence, and Thought All Belong to the Homeland; Renounce Political Disputes and Strive to Sacrifice Oneself to Repay the Country</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the leader of the Russian Youth Party (a White Russian émigré group), Stepanov, recently issued a declaration calling on Russians to abandon all political disputes and assist the motherland as much as possible in fighting against Germany. Although the party has always opposed the Soviet government, now that the Soviet government is defending its homeland for the long term, the party is abandoning its previous opposition policy. The declaration stated, in brief, that the Russian Youth Party had long expected that Germany would attack Russia. Although it cannot actively participate in defending Russia, its speech, beliefs, confidence, and thought all belong to the homeland. The Russian Youth Party has always placed the interests of Russia and the families of its people first. At this time when Russian blood flows from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea to resist every difficult season of German invasion, the young party members, born as children of Russia, reiterate that every Russian must stand on the side of the motherland. There can be no political disputes, but one should sacrifice oneself to repay the country.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Russian Broadcast of Soviet War News Banned by French Concession <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Considered to Contain Political Criticism; However, Russians Repeatedly Request Continued Broadcasting</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Troitsky, assistant editor of a Russian-language newspaper in this city, has been broadcasting war news from TASS and other sources in Russian every evening from 7:00 PM on the Great American Radio Station (call sign XMHC) at No. 17 Edward Road, which has been well-received by Russian radio listeners. However, it was suddenly announced yesterday (the 1st) that it would be stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Only Reporting News and Not Propagating <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to Troitsky, he received notification from the radio station that his broadcast report was banned by the French Concession Police, so he no longer broadcasts on the Great American Radio Station. However, he was quite surprised by this action of the French Concession Police, as his daily broadcast of news was not propaganda but simply reading news mostly from Moscow.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Listeners Request Continued Broadcasting <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Several Russian-language radio stations in the Public Concession have written to Troitsky, asking him to continue broadcasting to Russians on their stations. According to Shanghai Russians yesterday, Russian radio listeners welcome Troitsky's news broadcast because it can counter the Nazi propaganda messages broadcast in Russian by the German radio station here. Troitsky admitted that he had received more than one hundred phone calls from sympathizers, asking him to continue broadcasting news about the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Authorities Consider It a Violation of Orders <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also reported that Troitsky's broadcasting program was cancelled due to his violation of the conditions agreed upon with the Great American Radio Station. It is said that Troitsky had agreed with the radio station only to broadcast news in Russian, but he made critical remarks during the broadcast. The French Municipal Council had ordered the Great American Radio Station to prohibit political propaganda. Troitsky's political criticism violated the Council's orders, so the Russian-language program was terminated from last night.</p>
<h3 id="e48">British Tram Company and Labor Representatives Agree on Reciprocal Principles <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The workers in the machine and vehicle departments of the British Shanghai Tramways Company in this city, due to the current high prices and difficulty in maintaining their livelihoods, requested that the company authorities increase subsidies to compensate for this. Now, the union has agreed with the company's manager and the company authorities on three reciprocal principles between labor and management, and both parties have signed them. The reciprocal principles are as follows: (1) Increase the special living allowance for each mechanic, driver, and ticket seller by 60 cents per day. (2) Workers who are sick and hospitalized in Renji Hospital will continue to receive their basic salary, excluding subsidies for supplies and rice, but for a maximum of two weeks per person per year, and the company will pay the hospital expenses. In special circumstances where the time limit needs to be extended, the company may handle it at its discretion. (3) The "Peaceful Award" for drivers will be increased from 10 cents to 15 cents per day, and the monthly award for good conduct will be increased from two yuan to three yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Domestic Finance Remains Stable; Industry and Commerce Flourishing <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Annual Report of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's operating report for the 29th year of the Republic regarding the domestic economic situation generally stated: Due to years of unrest, losses have been not inconsiderable, and production and consumption cannot be improved temporarily during this wartime period. Generally speaking, the economic situation in various regions is still considered stable. The report is divided into finance, trade, prices, and industry and commerce, and excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e50">Domestic Finance Still Considered Stable <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Domestic finance, except for slight fluctuations in May, is still considered stable. Among financial institutions, the Nanjing Yeshang Bank's Shanghai branch temporarily suspended business; it soon resumed business, and other banks, such as Sichuan, Mei Chuan Salt, Gecheng, and Chongqing Banks, have successively increased their capital. To stabilize finance, the government promulgated measures to manage banks. As for the price of government bonds, both Shanghai and Wuhan rose sharply, almost on par with before the war. The newly issued government bonds were for military and construction needs, and the Four Banks Loan Committee loans reached 124 million yuan. The interest rates for loans throughout the year in Shanghai did not fluctuate significantly. The exchange rate for remittances, although it once reached a premium of 150 yuan, gradually decreased and is now equal to the original rate. The establishment of a new remittance system by silver and money exchanges has been quite convenient and well-received. However, the popularity of European Common Market notes among foreign merchants proves the prevalence of social speculation. Because of the abundance of floating capital in the market, Shanghai banks have seen a surge in deposits, mostly in the form of current accounts. At this time, banks have narrower avenues for lending, so they have all reduced interest rates to reduce costs.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Important Measures for Financial Undertakings <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>In addition to implementing measures to manage banks, the government's important measures for finance include: (1) Attention to rural loans: The Four Banks and other financial institutions have long-term loans in rural areas in the interior, totaling 20.9 million yuan, which can be said to be effective in adjusting the rural economy. (2) The efforts of the Exchange Stabilization Fund: After the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, it has made considerable efforts. With the cooperation of friendly countries, the exchange market has been stabilized. However, China has had a large trade deficit in recent years, making it difficult to balance international payments. Fortunately, the Exchange Stabilization Fund constantly assesses market conditions and determines buying and selling, otherwise the changes in the exchange market would have been even greater. (3) Issuance of new subsidiary coins: After the amendment of the Subsidiary Coin Regulations, the Central Mint immediately started minting these coins. However, the circulation area is limited to Free China, and subdivision banknotes and hard coins are issued in one corner to meet the needs. (4) Promotion of savings deposits: After the promulgation of the Savings Deposit Regulations, various banks have actively promoted savings deposits. Currently, they have reached over 300 million yuan and are opening simplified savings accounts to absorb social floating capital for national construction.</p>
<p>Flourishing Trade Saves the Trade Deficit</p>
<p>According to customs figures, the total value of national foreign trade was 3,997,263,000 yuan. Among them, the value of imports was 2,027,143,000 yuan, an increase of 693,489,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. The value of exports was 1,970,120,000 yuan, an increase of 942,874,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. The trade deficit was 57,022,000 yuan, a decrease of 149,385,000 yuan compared to the 28th year. However, the import figures are converted to national currency in gold units, and customs still converts them according to the government's legal exchange rate, while the export figures are calculated according to the black market exchange rate, so they cannot accurately reflect the trade situation. If the import figures are also calculated using the black market exchange rate, then imports should be 5,474,311,000 yuan, and the trade deficit should be 3,504,190,000 yuan, an increase of 1,309,414,000 yuan compared to the 28th year, so the prosperity of trade can be seen here. Shanghai accounts for the largest share of this huge import trade, accounting for 37.09 percent, followed by Tianjin, and then Qingdao.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Flourishing</p>
<p>The prosperity of industry and commerce in various regions is as in previous years. The imbalance between production and consumption has led to the abnormal development of industry and commerce. As far as Shanghai is concerned, except for those who went bankrupt and liquidated in May due to speculation failures, the rest have made countless profits. There are no accurate statistics on new industrial and commercial firms, so it is not convenient to make presumptions; what can be said is that the number of new companies far exceeds the number of bankruptcies, but they are all limited in capital and not large in scale. The industry and commerce in the interior are also extremely developed, due to the westward migration of the population, the increase in consumption, and the inconvenience of transportation, which prompted the planning of local manufacturing. All these are factors in the development of industry and commerce. The government is working hard to develop sources of profit, and the industry and commerce of Free China are just beginning to flourish.</p>
<p>Adjust Prices to Stabilize People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The sharp rise in prices in various regions this year is unprecedented. According to statistics, the price index at the end of last December was 37.2, and at the end of this December, it jumped to 611.4. From January to May, it gradually increased, from June to August, it slightly decreased, and after September, it rose in a straight line, an increase of 384.9 percent compared to one month before the war. Among the building materials category, cement rose the most, because the price of this commodity rose very little in the 28th year. The next largest increases were for white lead, silk, raw yellow leather, etc. The price of grain continued to rise sharply, and the issue of people's food became very serious, with the price of grain causing the rise of other prices. As for Chongqing, the price was lower than Shanghai from January to May, but after June, when Shanghai fell back slightly, Chongqing continued to rise steadily. The increase in the cost of living in the interior has increased endlessly, and the authorities have made every effort to adjust it to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Workers at Hongkou Japanese-Owned East Asia Tobacco Factories Strike <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Factory Refuses Demands, Creating a Stalemate; Windstorm at British-Owned United Shipyard Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>Recently, due to the soaring prices in this city, which have greatly affected the lives of workers, there have been frequent storms demanding improved treatment. A few days ago, the British-owned United Shipyard and the Japanese-owned East Asia No. 1 and No. 2 Tobacco Factories in the Hongkou district successively experienced strikes. The storm at the British-owned United Shipyard has been satisfactorily resolved, but the storm at the Japanese-owned factory may escalate because the factory has refused the demands. The reporter has investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Windstorm at United Shipyard Resolved</p>
<p>The British-owned United Shipyard (including Ruixing, Gefeng, Xiang Sheng shipyards and Dongjiadu dock) in Yangshupu, Hongkou, employs more than 3,250 workers. The factory has been doing well recently. Four Soviet merchant ships were brought into the dock for repairs last month. Workers worked day and night, streaming back and forth. Due to the high prices and difficult living conditions, all workers made two demands to the factory on the 25th of last month: (1) Increase wages by 30% to 50%. (2) Increase night work subsidy to one yuan per night. The factory manager, Bonner, accepted the principles and promised to reply after submitting them to the board of directors for discussion. The reply was not given until the end of last month (i.e., July 30). The workers had no choice but to strike on the morning of the 1st. The foreman of the factory, Li Fusheng, and the foremen Yan Guoguang, Sun Jinyang, and Qian Rendao persuaded the workers to return to work and made requests to the factory, and negotiations were held on that day. Through sincere efforts to resolve the situation, the following was agreed: (1) A general wage increase of 20%. (2) The night work subsidy was deemed satisfactory. The dispute was resolved completely.</p>
<p>Joint Strike at Japanese-Owned Tobacco Factory</p>
<p>The East Asia No. 1 Factory (formerly the Chinese-owned Huadong Tobacco Factory) on Tangkou Road, Baoding Road and the East Asia No. 2 Factory (formerly the Chinese-owned Huaping Tobacco Factory) at the intersection of Peikai Er Road and Liaoyang Road have a total of more than 2,600 male and female workers. Recently, due to the slow business of the factory, work has been reduced, and the wages earned by the workers are less than ten yuan per month, making it impossible to maintain a living. Moreover, the treatment of the two factories is usually more harsh than that of other factories. Work has been reduced, and meal subsidies have also been deducted, making the lives of the workers even more unbearable. The workers had no choice but to jointly strike on the 30th of last month and make four demands: (1) A general wage increase of 100%. (2) A rice subsidy of six dou per month. (3) Work deductions should not deduct meal expenses. (4) Workers should be paid during sick leave. Representatives were sent to the factory, but the factory completely refused without any consideration. The two sides have reached extremes. The workers insist that their goals must be achieved. The management has notified the police and dispatched Chinese and Japanese detectives to arrest the workers' representatives as a threat. Both sides have a very firm attitude. If the stalemate continues, it may lead to a serious situation.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Prices Rising Again; Authorities Strictly Prohibiting <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Simply Investigating Prices Is of Little Help</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that a spokesman for the Municipal Council stated yesterday (the 1st) that recent political developments have given the profiteers in this city an opportunity to raise prices. The prices of almost all daily necessities rose yesterday. The prices of some imported goods have already been raised, but the prices of domestic products have not changed much. Merchants said that the stock of imported goods will not be replenished, so prices are rising. It is expected that it will be difficult to obtain imported goods in the future, and the prices of imported luxury goods have already risen significantly last week. Regarding rice, the public should purchase the foreign rice purchased by the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to save money. The former sells for 116 yuan per dan, and the latter sells for 89 yuan. The responsible party said that the only way to control the profiteers is to strictly control prices. Simply investigating prices is of little help. It is reported that the department stores in this city have agreed to raise prices uniformly at a specified time, using the difficulty of procuring goods as an excuse.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Scholarship Applicant Investigation Begins Yesterday <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Bank Employees Respond with Group Donations, Movie Star Li Qinian Also Promotes Donations</p>
<p>Our newspaper's reader scholarship applications have been pouring in these past few days. Our newspaper staff has been extremely busy handling the procedures for allocation, review, and approval. Since schools at all levels are about to begin, in order to prioritize the studies of the applicants, we began investigations yesterday. Our newspaper dispatched many personnel to visit the actual living conditions of each family. Although it was unbearably hot yesterday, everyone happily set out. We hope that applicants will cooperate and provide convenience when our newspaper sends personnel to visit. For applicants with special circumstances, our newspaper will send separate letters to notify them to come to the office for an interview. Please be punctual upon receiving the letter and do not break the appointment.</p>
<p>Donations Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday's donors include a group of bank employees with 1,000 yuan, Ms. Li Qinian with 300 yuan, workers at Hongen Hospital with a combined donation of 94 yuan, Mr. Zhou Baotai with 50 yuan collected by Tong Lianbin, Mr. Zhang Xiufu with 2 yuan, totaling 1,446 yuan. Previously stored 16,966 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen, for a grand total of 18,412 yuan, 6 jiao, 1 fen.</p>
<p>Group Scholarship</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fundraising achieved outstanding results. Employees of a major bank responded with a group donation, allocating 1,000 yuan, setting an example for the banking industry. The bank employees hold the belief that "doing good is the greatest joy" and prefer not to reveal their bank's name or their individual names, which can be considered the ultimate act of kindness. Movie star Ms. Li Qinian recently received a remuneration of 400 yuan for advertising a certain product and added 100 yuan herself. In addition to donating 200 yuan to a destitute children's orphanage, she donated 300 yuan yesterday to support scholarships. Her warm heart and traditional values are admirable. Seventy-three workers from Hongen Hospital also made group donations through their union. Everyone's money is earned through hard work and is not easily obtained, so their generous donations and chivalrous spirit are commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Iron Gates of the French Concession and Nanshi Continue to Be Closed <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>They Were Opened for Five Minutes Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the French authorities implemented temporary security measures on the 1st to maintain order within the Concession, in addition to erecting barbed wire fences along Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward, and securing non-essential roads, the iron gates that normally opened between the French Concession and Nanshi were also closed. Until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the French authorities ordered the closed iron gates to be reopened, and a large number of people entered and exited Nanshi for a short period. It was then heard that the Japanese demanded that they be resealed. The French authorities then ordered them to be closed again. Therefore, the opening yesterday morning only lasted for five minutes. However, a large number of ordinary people were blocked inside and outside the iron gates and stood waiting for the gates to open. Until the evening, the iron gates remained tightly shut and did not reopen. Whether they will be open today is still a question.</p>
<p>The closure of the iron gates at the border between the French Concession and Chinese Nanshi has been going on for three days now. The situation inside the city is gradually easing. It is reported that in the northern part of the city, on streets such as Route de la République (Huafaguo Minguo Lu), postmen and government vehicles are allowed to pass, while north of Fangbang Road, Japanese military police are still stationed with guns and live ammunition, making the situation more tense. The Japanese troops along Libang Road have now retreated and been replaced by . Ordinary residents are still not allowed to take a single step outside. South of Fangbang Road, in the Jia Road area, people can move freely. The Japanese military police have posted a notice stating that all public officials with identification documents, as well as women, children, and the elderly (children limited to under 14 years of age), are allowed to pass. However, the route that women and children can take must follow the Zhao Kai River and then reach the Concession. In the refugee area, Japanese military police are searching house by house, but due to insufficient manpower, the work is very delayed. There is still no confirmed date for when all the iron gates will officially open.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Shipping Company in this port received a telegram from Shantou stating, "Passengers traveling to Shantou must have a certificate of epidemic prevention and a certificate of typhoid fecal examination before being allowed to disembark." Therefore, the company is notifying passengers traveling to Shantou that they must complete the above procedures in advance before boarding the ship to avoid being hindered when disembarking.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Customs Decides on Fifteen Categories of Goods Prohibited for Export <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>However, Some Items Included Have Not Been Decided Yet</p>
<p>After the United States and the United Kingdom froze Japanese funds, the Japanese side immediately took various retaliatory actions in Shanghai, such as the Japanese consulate announcing regulations to ban transactions involving foreign interests. At the same time, they controlled export trade, banning the export of certain necessities in order to deal a major blow to British and American merchants. Starting from July 28th, the notice issued by Japanese customs officer Mitsuaki Oyamada implemented an embargo on seven types of goods, which was later expanded to eleven types. By the 30th of last month, it was expanded to fifteen types, plunging the export trade in this port into a state of stagnation. It is now known that the so-called fifteen types are: (1) leather, (2) chaff and bran, (3) rice and grains, (4) wheat and flour, (5) dyes, pigments, and paints, (6) edible vegetable oils, (7) rubber, (8) coal, (9) cotton and cotton wool, (10) , (11) wool, (12) mineral sand, (13) metals, (14) machinery and tools, (15) chemicals. However, which specific goods are included in the fifteen categories is reportedly still undecided.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Bombing Case in Front of Zhao Feng Park: Bomber Dies on the Spot, One Accomplice Seriously Injured, Multiple Bombs Found in Residence <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", a bombing occurred in front of Zhao Feng Park at 9:15 PM yesterday (the 1st). It has been learned that only one person was killed in the bombing, and one man and one woman were seriously injured. The man is named Zhang Qingrong, 20 years old, and the woman is named Fang Ninghua (both transliterations). Pan Da of the Shanghai West Special Police investigated the case today. Zhang Qingrong has admitted that he is also involved in the case. Pan Da went to search Zhang's home on Jessfield Road this morning and confiscated multiple hand grenades and small bombs. It was also learned that the bomber intended to throw the bomb from the toilet next to the gate of Zhao Feng Park, but the bomb exploded, and the bomber died. Furthermore, the "She Wen She" reports that at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, in front of the Yinxing Car Company station in front of the Zhao Feng Garden on Yu Yuan Road in West Shanghai, a man threw a hand grenade into the crowd, which exploded on the spot. Because the bomber did not know how to throw the bomb, he was killed on the spot. More than a dozen other people were injured.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Wang Yongliang of Wang Yongji Weaving Factory, I recently read a news item titled "Major Fire on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning" in the local news column of the Shenbao, Sino-American Daily, which contained many inaccuracies. The fire did not occur in our factory. The police have conducted an on-site investigation, and the truth will be revealed. Because I was in a state of extreme panic at the time, I was unable to take out my clothes and belongings. My eight-year-old son, Guohai, unfortunately died in the fire. I am heartbroken by this sudden tragedy. There was also an apprentice from Changzhou, a shoemaking apprentice, who has nothing to do with our factory. Please send a letter to stop, etc. I am writing to you on his behalf and hope your newspaper will make a correction. Sincerely, The Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, August 2nd.</p>

Higher education in Fujian Province appears to be more developed, with National Xiamen University, Private Union College, Private Hwa-En Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Private Fukien College, Provincial Medical and Agricultural College, Provincial Music School, Su-Wan Joint Political Science College, and the Provincial Normal School, which will soon be formally established, totaling nine institutions. Additionally, there is a Provincial Research Institute, the highest academic institution.</p>
<p>In terms of content, although the Zhejiang University branch and Yingshi University in Zhejiang Province were only recently established, they are quite vigorous, and their teaching methods are relatively novel and earnest. There are currently many students, and all internal facilities are managed in accordance with the central government's intentions. The equipment is also barely adequate. The Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical School has a longer history and can be considered suitable in terms of both management and actual conditions. Xiamen University in Fujian, originally a famous institution in the southeast, has not only improved its administrative efficiency since being converted into a national university in 1937 but has also implemented various plans systematically, and its equipment is more complete than that of other inland institutions. Most gratifyingly, the number of students has increased dramatically, worthy of being the highest academic institution in the southeastern half of the country. The Union College, run by the American Church, has become increasingly sophisticated in its content and spirit since moving to Shaowu and has provided much assistance to the local community. Its progress is not only outstanding among general church schools, but there are probably not many public and private universities in the mainland today that can compare to it. Other private schools such as South China and Fukien each have their strengths and weaknesses, but are generally not bad. Furthermore, the Provincial Medical and Agricultural College and the two specialized schools of Music and Normal Education were established by the authorities to cultivate appropriate specialists, so they have particularly ample funding and have recruited many specialized professors. If they continue to advance in this order, there is much hope for progress.</p>
<p>The Su-Wan Joint Political Science College also has good content and spirit and is no less inferior to newly established universities in general. Although the name of the Provincial Research Institute does not comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, its purpose is quite relevant, and its funding is also very ample. The social science department of the institute is entrusted to the relevant departments of Xiamen University, while the natural science department runs research institutes for agriculture, engineering, medicine, mining, metallurgy, etc. The research centers and various ongoing plans that have been formulated are all in line with the needs of the province. Currently, students in various provincial institutions in Fujian Province enjoy the privilege of having all tuition, board, lodging, and miscellaneous fees waived, which is a great benefit to young people. It is feared that students at other national institutions may not have this luxury. Over the past decade, I have been ordered to inspect education in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, and this is my fourth trip, so I have a thorough understanding of the actual situation. In summary, I have three impressions from this trip: (1) Zhejiang Province, due to environmental factors, does not have as much funding as Fujian Province, and the scope of its operations is smaller, so it may be difficult to expand it as much as possible for the time being. (2) Zhejiang and Fujian provinces are both under the threat of the Japanese army on three sides, but they have been able to achieve such a good phenomenon of steady progress, not neglecting the cultivation of specialists and being able to promote planned and orderly development, which is truly commendable. (3) The spirit and determination of the two provinces in developing educational and cultural undertakings are no less than in improving other general administrative affairs, and the results are also particularly remarkable, which is quite comforting to the people of the country, he said.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Establishes Overseas Chinese Normal School in Changting</p>
<p>(Yongan, 1st) Overseas Chinese leader Chen Jiageng, due to the lack of teachers in Nanyang, previously suggested establishing a normal school in China to train teachers for overseas Chinese schools. The Ministry of Education has approved his request and has chosen to open a school in Changting, Fujian, which will be able to enroll students and begin classes in mid-September.</p>
<p>Youth Association Holds Children's Carnival</p>
<p>The Children's Reading Room attached to the Chinese Christian Youth Association has been very popular since it opened on June 22nd. In order to regulate children's lives, the association provides proper books for children to read and also offers singing, drama, storytelling, and news reports. It has also decided to hold a children's carnival every other week. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the association held its third carnival in the auditorium of the Youth Association in Baxianqiao. In addition to songs, plays, and other recreational programs, there were also educational films, which were very exciting. The event was attended by a large crowd of children.</p>

<p>Samsung and Leyou to Replay Today, Two Wonderful Performances Before the Game</p>
<p>The Pei Zhi Cup Charity Mini-Soccer Tournament, organized by the Mighty Lions Football Club, opened last month with Shunji defeating Hualian. Another match between Samsung and Leyou ended in a draw. This replay has been postponed three times due to rain. The two teams are now scheduled to clash at 6:00 p.m. today at the Poor Children's Education Home at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Wuding Road to determine the winner. The winner will play Shunji next week to compete for the championship. In order to increase its strength, Leyou has borrowed all the players from the Hualian Cup Championship team, the Dragon Team, in addition to its original players, including the famous general Jia Youliang, making its lineup very strong. Qin Bigao guards the goal, Meng Yiliang and Zhang Lingen are defenders, Cai Shengsen is a center-back, and the defense is as solid as a rock. Huang Kehou, Jia Youliang, and Wan Jin charge into battle as forwards, making them incredibly sharp. Looking at the above lineup, it is no different from the prototype of the Chinese team. In order to counter this, Samsung, in addition to borrowing M. Suor and Favanxiao from Portugal, has also obtained the assistance of famous players Costan, Oliveira, V. Suor, and Gane, making them even more powerful. Fu En will also play. Today, when the two heroes meet, it will be like a match between China and Portugal, and it will be exciting to watch.

<h3 id="e66">Talking about Courage <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Little Friends! What is courage? Is it boldly doing bad things? Is it stubbornly ignoring other people's advice and fighting with people? No, these behaviors are obstinacy; obstinacy and courage are absolutely different. Obstinacy is an irrational act, while courage is a rational, clear, and pure behavior. In other words, courage is a virtue of sacrificing oneself without fear or retreat.</p>
<p>However, there are many kinds of courage! When the country is in danger, citizens rise up together, braving artillery fire to do their best for the country, this is courage; in addition, when something happens, a third party bravely acts righteously, rescuing the unfortunate on the one hand and striking the tyrannical on the other, this is also courage; furthermore, seeing someone fall into the water, quickly rescuing them, seeing an elderly person in trouble, quickly helping them, this is also courage; even more so, if you have done something wrong, admit it frankly and quickly correct yourself, this is also courage; as for studying diligently, when you come to society, overcoming endless difficulties, tasting profound pain, seeking happiness for the people, and establishing immortal achievements for yourself, this is also courage!</p>
<p>So the object of courage is very diverse, it all depends on how you choose! The most shameful and hateful people in the world are the cowardly and weak people; these people are not only waste products of humanity, but also pests of society!</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you ask yourself if you are brave or not? Which of the above kinds of courage do you belong to?</p>
<h3 id="e67">Summer Vacation Life of Rural Children <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Little friends, since the summer vacation began, almost a month has passed in the blink of an eye. Do you know what the summer vacation life of rural children is like in the city? This time, because I took advantage of the holidays to spend the summer in the countryside, I want to report the summer vacation life of rural children to the little friends in Shanghai so that you can know how children spend this summer vacation in the countryside.</p>
<p>Just like you, rural children also have a nearly two-month-long vacation during the summer. Except for a small number of children who go to summer cram schools, reading for half a day every morning, or have teachers come to their homes to tutor them, most children do not study and spend the two months of summer vacation unknowingly.</p>
<p>Of course, not studying all day long requires finding some things to pass the time, otherwise it would be too boring. In the countryside, there are no cinemas or Beijing opera houses, so general children have to find their own entertainment or things to amuse themselves. During this summer season, the most common things that rural children do are probably fishing and catching cicadas!</p>
<p>Using bamboo to make fishing rods, heating sewing needles with fire to bend them, and tying them to the line, all fishing equipment is made by the children themselves. Standing under the willow tree, putting some bait on the hook, such as flies and rice bugs! Throwing it into the water, and seeing a fish bite the hook, they pick up the bamboo pole, and a lively fish is caught. If they do well! They can catch dozens of fish in less than half a day, it's quite flavorful!</p>
<p>As for cicadas, they can be seen everywhere in the countryside. Children use spiderwebs or grease made from tung oil, putting it on bamboo poles. Seeing cicadas perched on large trees by the river or in the garden, they gently extend the bamboo poles to the place where the cicadas are hiding, and with quick eyes and hands, they poke accurately and can stick the cicadas and catch them to take home to play with.</p>
<p>That's how it is during the day. Once night falls, many children gather in the courtyard to enjoy the cool, telling stories. They are happy to play hide-and-seek and snatch corners under the moon. Some also take glass bottles, and seeing fireflies flying by, they use palm-leaf fans to swat them down and catch a bottle, which is shiny and very beautiful. In a few more days, cricket mothers, spinning ladies, crickets, etc. will all appear, and the children will be busy catching these things again!</p>
<h3 id="e68">Reading "Father's Caretaker" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Le'an Elementary School</p>
<p>Five Below Jiang Yuanxi Gu Qiufang</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, in addition to doing the homework assigned by the teachers, we read "Education of Love". Yesterday, we read an article "Father's Caretaker".</p>
<p>The main character in this story is an Italian boy, Xixiluo. The content describes everything he did to welcome his father, who had just returned from working abroad.</p>
<p>His father returned, but before he arrived home, he fell ill in the Nampurs Hospital. Xixiluo went to welcome him, but mistakenly recognized an old worker who had also returned from working abroad, who was very ill. Xixiluo took very good care of him.</p>
<p>After Xixiluo discovered his real father, he was truly filled with mixed feelings of grief and joy, but he refused to go back with his father, who was recovering. He said to his father: "You see, he is looking at me there? If I leave, he will die."</p>
<p>Xixiluo still served the old man in the same way, still taking care of him with all his heart, until the old man died with a smile.</p>
<p>Xixiluo is truly a good child. After reading this article, our hearts were greatly moved, because where can we do Xixiluo's kind of moving filial piety and all the spirit of enduring hardship to serve the unfortunate sick?</p>
<p>Therefore, we must learn from Xixiluo, be filial to our parents, love our friends, and serve the world and mankind.</p>
<p>Little friends, "Education of Love" is an extracurricular reading material that is most suitable for our elementary school students. We recommend that everyone read this book. If you see good books, also tell us in the Children's Weekly!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Making Soda <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>Last Sunday, my younger brother ate cold noodles made with agar-agar and found them cool and delicious. Today, he asked his mother to make them again. His mother said: "Although cold noodles are delicious, they are not as good as soda for quenching thirst and relieving heat, and they are also good for the body. We might as well make a bottle of soda to drink, and we can also change the taste."</p>
<p>So, my mother took a bottle with a glass ball stopper, and prepared boiled water, tartaric acid, sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda), lemon oil, and saccharin. When making it, she first put five parts each of tartaric acid and baking soda in the bottle, then added a few drops of lemon oil, a little saccharin, and then poured in boiled water, quickly covering the mouth of the bottle with her hand and turning it upside down, so that the glass ball stopper would firmly close the mouth of the bottle.</p>
<p>My younger brother watched his mother make it with rapt attention and found it very interesting. After his mother finished making it, he asked, "Is the soda made like this exactly the same as the soda sold in the market?"</p>
<p>His mother said, "The soda factories use sulfuric acid instead of tartaric acid; some also use stone powder instead of baking soda. They also add various fruit juices or other flavoring agents, so the taste is more delicious. And the manufacturing methods, whether it is filtering water, making gas, or bottling, all use machines, so they can produce in large quantities."</p>
<p>After a while, his mother used force to open the bottle stopper and poured it into a cup, and many bubbles formed. My younger brother drank it and asked, "Mom, why are there so many bubbles in the soda?"</p>
<p>His mother replied, "Because the baking soda put in the soda reacts with the tartaric acid, it produces a large amount of carbonic acid gas. When the bottle cap is opened, it becomes a bubble and immediately escapes. Therefore, soda should be drunk immediately after it is poured out, otherwise the carbonic acid gas will escape and the effect will be less."</p>
<p>My younger brother asked in surprise. "Carbonic acid gas? I heard the teacher at school say that it is harmful to us. Now we drink soda and swallow a lot of carbonic acid gas, is it okay?"</p>
<p>His mother explained, "That's right, if a large amount of carbonic acid gas is inhaled into the lungs, it is indeed harmful, and may even cause suffocation and death. But if it is mixed with a drink and swallowed into the stomach, its acidity can actually aid digestion."</p>
<h3 id="e70">Three "Whys?" <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I had been to my grandmother's house. So Aliang's mother chose a cloudy afternoon and took Aliang to visit his grandmother's house.</p>
<p>Aliang's grandmother's house had recently added a refrigerator, which caught Aliang's eye, and he thought it was so novel at the time: a square and large wooden box, painted white on the outside, with two doors that could be opened and closed on the top and sides. He curiously pulled the top cover hard, only to see an concave tin plate inside, with a rectangular block of machine ice placed in the recessed area, surrounded by many wood shavings; the raised tin sheet had many small holes. When he opened the lid, a gust of cold air rushed to his face, making him shiver. He opened the door below and saw many things inside, like soda, fruit, etc., and many dewdrops grew on the soda bottles. He was overjoyed to see it, and he seemed to have discovered something new today, but "Why is the ice in the refrigerator placed on top? Why is the ice hidden in wood shavings? Why are there dewdrops on the soda bottles?" Aliang asked these three "whys" in a row. He certainly couldn't turn one "why" into two "becauses", and no one at his grandmother's house could answer these "whys". So before dinner, he asked his mother to go back.</p>
<p>His grandmother initially tried her best to keep him and his mother for dinner, but seeing that Aliang was so insistent, she didn't force them to stay.</p>
<p>As soon as Aliang stepped into the door, he hurried to find his father to ask him to solve these "whys".</p>
<p>"The first why is the ice placed on the top of the refrigerator? Because the ice in the refrigerator can cool the air around it, but cold air is heavier and sinks to the bottom of the refrigerator, and hot air is lighter and is driven to the top of the refrigerator by the sinking cold air, and the ice then cools the hot air again and sinks down again, so the air circulates in the refrigerator. The ice is placed on the top of the refrigerator to take advantage of the point that cold air sinks and hot air rises, so that it can circulate continuously and completely cool all the air in the refrigerator. This is the reason for the first 'why'. The second why is the ice hidden in wood shavings? You need to know that the temperature in summer is very high, often around ninety degrees, but the temperature of ice is low. Ice is very easy to melt in the summer, and the effect of ice disappears, so you have to hide the ice in wood shavings, because wood shavings are not easy to conduct heat, so you can save the ice for some time and not dissolve very quickly. The third why is there dewdrops on the soda bottles? The temperature of the soda bottles in the refrigerator is very low. Once the water vapor in the air comes into contact with these cold soda bottles, it condenses into many dewdrops. This is the reason for the third 'why'. Speaking of making the ice not dissolve quickly, in addition to hiding it in wood shavings, there is another method: that is to put salt on the ice, because salt and ice together can make the temperature even lower, lower than the temperature of pure ice, so it is not easy to dissolve into water. But it is actually wrong to put wood shavings in the refrigerator at my grandmother's house, because when the ice dissolves, it absorbs the heat in the refrigerator, so that the temperature inside can be lowered, so that the things in the ice will not spoil. If you hide the ice in wood shavings, the ice will not dissolve, but the temperature in the box will not be lowered, so the things in the ice cannot be kept fresh. Next time you go to your grandmother's house, you must tell them this principle."</p>

<p>— Reflection</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen has left and left again, making it difficult for her husband! Wang Shizhen's tears and laughter are due to cause and effect.</p>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) Before the war, when Shu Xiuwen was still an actress at the Star Film Company, she once proposed a permanent separation from her husband, Pan Zienong, due to dissatisfaction with their life. Later, thanks to the mediation of Zhou Jianyun, Xu Xingzhi, and others, they were able to live in peace. However, not long after, Shu Xiuwen suddenly asked lawyer Zhu Sifu to send a letter to her husband, demanding an unconditional termination of their marital relationship. As a result, friendly mediation failed, and thus,</p>
<p>Wang Broke the Frame But before this incident had even unfolded for long, news spread that Xiuwen was passionately in love with Wang Shizhen, a photographer at the same company. Coincidentally, Wang had gone to Hankou on business, and it was at this time that Shu Xiuwen secretly followed him to Hankou. Soon after, they both went to Hong Kong, never to return. Afterwards, according to insiders, this was all a</p>
<p>Cleverly Conceived Plan The truth of which could not be verified. Soon, they traveled from Hong Kong to Kunming and other places, honeymooning while continuing their respective work. Later, they were invited by the Chongqing China Film Studio, so the two took a plane to Chongqing to live their beautiful and ideal life. However, not even a year after arriving in Chongqing, news of marital disputes was frequently heard. At first, friends thought this was inevitable between couples, so they didn't interfere. Unexpectedly, as time went on, the disputes became more intense, even leading to a separation of more than two months, with each living at a friend's place. Friends</p>
<p>Mediated From Within Urging them to reconcile, but to no avail. The husband claimed that his wife had found someone else and didn't return home at night, while the wife claimed that her husband didn't care about his health and made friends indiscriminately. Both sides insisted on their own versions of the story. Friends couldn't blindly judge who was right or wrong, and seeing that their positions seemed unusually firm, they stopped interfering. Recent news has revealed that they have indeed</p>
<p>Signed a Divorce Agreement The truth is that on the evening of July 4th, they entrusted lawyer Luo Qilan to formally sign the divorce agreement, with Wang Shizhen paying the woman 1,500 yuan for three months of living expenses. Now, this marital change has finally been resolved smoothly, but it has caused a stir throughout the capital. Some say: The film industry is truly incredible. At the same time, there was Zhou Yan's marital change in the isolated island, and Shu Wang's marital change in the capital. Though separated by mountains, these marital changes are not isolated incidents. The film circle can be considered to be going through eventful times. Yesterday, Ms. Li asked her agent, Wu Yongzi, to visit, saying that Ms. Li greatly approves of the Shen Bao's student aid fund, and has specially donated 400 yuan from the advertising fees of a certain product, plus an additional 100 yuan, with 300 yuan for student aid and 200 yuan for the orphanage, to do her part for "Save the Children." I was greatly moved upon hearing this! Her praiseworthy and compassionate heart for children is the first of its kind among film people, and it will surely move the sympathy of people inside and outside the film circle. "The heart of compassion is in everyone." Ms. Li can appreciate the virtues of the ancients and put them into practice, which is admirable. This is written in acknowledgement. (Editor) The photo on the right is Ms. Li's new photo, taken by Yu Xiongqing.</p>

Xu Jing sighed and said, "Although we have been separated for only a short time, there have been great changes in that time, enough to make one feel sentimental." He then briefly told Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei about the situation after they left Qixian County, from the bandit Hong Niangzi attacking the city at Green Stone Mountain and Li Xin being captured, to him joining the army in Daizhou and the fierce battle in Ningwu, as well as how he met Liu Yinying. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei sat by and listened, sometimes laughing loudly, sometimes sighing sadly, sometimes gesticulating wildly, and sometimes weeping bitterly. They were extremely moved by General Zhou Yuji's heroic defense of Ningwu and his sacrifice for righteousness. Finally, Xu Jing briefly stated his and Liu Yinying's desire to join them and asked Zhang and Chen to speak to General Wu and have them enlisted. Zhang Cangqiu nodded and said, "This matter will definitely succeed with me. Now is the time when people are needed. It is rare that you two have come here, and we can work together to support the royal family. However, General Wu is not here, and Guerrilla Officer Chai Ying cannot make a decision. Wait a few days, General Wu will return, and then I will introduce you to him." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your trouble, brother." Zhang Cangqiu then said, "You and Mr. Xu have come a long way and must be tired from your journey. You need to rest. This place is not suitable for a long chat. Please come with me to the barracks, where I and my brother will prepare some wine and dishes to wash away your fatigue." Xu Jing was not polite and said, "Very good, very good." Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei then led the two away from the General's Office and back to the East City barracks. Their barracks were behind the Xuantan Temple, built a long time ago, the houses were half new and half old, with many flags planted, and there were guards standing at the camp gate, making it look majestic and solemn. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei accompanied the two into the camp gate, but took a detour along a small path on the left to their private resting place, which was a very bright room, simply furnished, but clean. Zhang Cangqiu invited Xu Jing and Liu Yinying to sit down on the chairs, and then he called over a horse boy and instructed him to prepare wine and dishes. (132)</p>

<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>China United to Produce Films in Large Quantities China United Film Company will greatly increase its production in the second half of the year to meet the needs of the six major theaters: Xinhua, Huguang, Xinguang, Jincheng, and Quan Delian. Zhang Shankun, the owner of China United, specially hosted a banquet for all the directors for this matter. It is reported that each director will be responsible for all production work in addition to directing the film, that is, the director must fully command the scenery, props, costumes, etc., which is similar to the nature of a production director, so that the production can increase its speed.</p>
<p>Yi Hua Starts Filming New Films After "The Merry Widow," Li Qinian's new works, "Modern Youth" and "Forever," are being filmed simultaneously. Lu Luming, after completing "Female Zombie," also plays the lead role in "Forever." Ye Yifang's "Thief Beauty" will be directed by Li Pingqian, with Li Qinian as the female lead. This film is scheduled to start filming this month. After completing "Red Powder Thief," Li Lihua will star in a new detective film, "Full City Storm," directed by Yan Youxiang himself.</p>
<p>Golden Star Films Peach Blossom Lake Golden Star's first work after the move, "Peach Blossom Lake," is scheduled to begin filming next Monday, and all major actors have been assigned. "Peach Blossom Lake" is one of the posthumous works of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, and it is also the collaborative crystallization of Cai Chusheng and Yan Heming when they first entered the film industry. Now, Zheng Xiaoqiu is the director, and Yan Heming is responsible for the production. The younger generation pushes the older generation forward, which is also a small change.</p>
<p>Dragon Gate Opening Date Approaching The Dragon Gate Theater, rebuilt from the Green Bao Dance Hall, will open around the 20th of this month. The male actors are Shu Shi, Huang He, and others, and the female lead is planned to be Bai Hong. Although Bai Hong has a basic contract with Golden Star, there is no problem as long as it does not interfere with filming. It is said that Ju Manhua will also be hired as a regular actor, but the possibility is less likely.</p>
