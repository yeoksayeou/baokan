<p>社評</p>
<h3>論美日談判</h3>
<p>以日本今天的國際處境來說、牠不獨歡迎與美國舉行談判，即使對遠東反侵略陣綫中的·中·英·蘇·荷等任何一國，也在希冀以各個擊破的手段，達到自己的目的。所以在根本上、牠不得不堅持兩點：第一，對手必須是個別的，第一，談判對象必須是局部的。牠不獨反對在反侵略各國的集議裏列席，接受大家對牠的宣判：同時，即使反侵略陣綫中的任何一國，要想把自己對於遠東整個大局的見解，使日本接受，大概也完全不可能的。總之，日本這一决從事對美談判的用意，仍是向來的個別擊破技術的運甩企圖先行緩和與美國之間的危機，守候適當的時間，再佈置對反侵略陣綫的任何一部份，作重大的出擊。這一層，是絲毫無庸懷疑的事。</p>
<p>令人不免發生相當疑問的，却是對於美國方面。首先是動機的問題。如果說，美國這决從事對日談判的用意，是在於一舉而解決整個的遠東紛亂形勢，那末，假定事前沒有與中·英·蘇·荷等國的一致諒解與佈置，這一舉，顯然是根本不可能的。可是照天，日談判舉行以來各國的種種反饗看，不獨中國方面已經表示了深重關心，蘇聯方面始終還在守着緘默；即使搆成日本南進最重要對象之一的荷印也絲毫沒有有什麼表示，與美國利害一體的英國，除了邱吉爾演說裏順帶提到一次外，也沒有再看到什麼平行的具體動作。如果說，美國是為了集中力量對付歐洲，所以舉行對日本談判，暫且緩和東方危機的話，那末，這一談判應當舉行在德。蘇大戰爆發之前，而不應當舉行於蘇聯明白參加歐洲及亞洲兩面反侵略陣綫的今日。如果說，美國因為看出了日本富前的國際窘境，所以趁機搶先一着，利用國際共同壓力，先取得牠自身個別利益保障的話，那末，這不獨違背了反侵略陣綫一致協同動作的國際義務與道德，同時，也絕對與美國素來光明正直的外交傳統相矛盾，而且進一步，也許要自已紊亂了陣綫，招致了對自身的不利。這一些，都是令一般觀察者百思而不得其解的。還有這對於這一决美·日談判的內容，直到現在，還是一個猜不透的謎。這是令人感到非常不安的現象：一方面如果沒有與其餘各國不利的處所，當然沒有絕對秘密的必要；另一面，以同是反侵略陣綫一員的身份，中·英·蘇·荷等國的當局及人民，都同樣有要求知悉的權利與義務。所以美國這一决舉行對日談判的環境與過程，無論如何，不得不算是一個失着。唯一値得大家引為放心的一點，祇有前兩天美國當局對美·日談判所下「試探」性質的解釋。在動機上，當然希望美國在初步談判裏本來沒有什麼具體成見，唯一意思，不過在於試探出日本的態度，然後再與中·英·蘇·荷等國共同定對日的談判方案。在內容上，也希望着因為本來沒有具體內容的關係、所以沒有什麼可以宣佈的。因而在方式上，美·日兩國間的談判，僅僅是一個暫時開路性質，而遠東方面將來任何國際性的動作，仍舊必然是以反侵略陣綫協同的方式出現。當然，從這個角度和限度看起來，對於美·日間這一度的接洽，我們應發現不了什麼値得表示反對的處所；因而對於前天華盛頓官方所下的進一步解釋，認為這度試探的本身，就等於形成一個暫不訴之戰爭的，美·日間「靜止默契」的這樣意見。也祗須加上一個限制的要求。即是，無論在實質或形式上，都必須以這樣為止，在解釋方面，固然不能再容許任何更進的引伸，即使像這同樣性質的「試探」談判，今而後，也希望牠永不再行出現。</p>
<p>這裏要附帶論到的，是綏靖主義的復活問題。以美國這决的對日談判舉動來說，牠當然沒有理由希望大家不發生綏靖主義復活的印象。然而値得我們辨別的，却是根本實質上非常明顯的不同。無論英國張伯倫一派或美國孤立派　綏靖主義，實質上，都是積極的一種主張、而不是純消極的向暴力屈服。在他們自成系統的，對世界局勢的整個見解下，他們提出對東西侵略者的綏靖主張。當然的大前提。是他們不相信侵略者會與他們本國形成難以調和的衝突，因而接下來，他們準備聽任侵略者對弱小國家民族的瓜分，而終至促成與蘇聯間的衝突。可是今天的形勢，根本上已經完全起了變更。羅斯福與邱吉爾，都曾一再向世界宣示過侵略者對美國英國形成危機的嚴重。而恢復所有被侵各國的主權與完整，及與蘇聯合作到底這兩點，允其形成了英·美今後政策的兩大支柱。恢復綏靖主義，就等於承認國際侵略原則，像羅斯福。邱吉爾這樣卓越的世界政治家，無論如何。是不會做出這樣舉動的。</p>
<p>最後，是中國在這决美·日談判形勢裏的立塲，也就如同美國對於中國的具體利害估計，未必與中國方面的見解相同一樣，中國對於美國自身利害的意見當然也未必能求得與美國相同。但兩國間至少有兩點是相同的：一是反侵略，一是合作重建世界。在這兩個根本一致下，中。美不獨要自矢忠貞，同時也有彼此要求忠貞的權利與義務</p>
<h3>華府採堅決立場　美日談判暫停頓</h3>
<p>妥給空氣係出於日方宣傅　衆料美不致漠視中國意見</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十五日東京電此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、美日談判巳因華盛頓方面提出若干問題而吿擱淺、初步協定內容、原定日內宜布、現亦無形打消、據稱、近衛首相原定於本月十日或十一日晚間發表廣播演說、說明對美談判情形、然後由美總統羅斯福於本月十二日演說中予以答復、一面由日政府情報局發言人向報界予以宜布、凡此均已作罷、至於美日談判觸礁性質如何雖不得而知、惟此間人士對於談判前途、認為並未絕望云、</p>
<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電遠東傳來東京與華盛頓即將成立範圍廣大的妥洽、美日關係處於友好基礎上之消息、此間消息靈通者迄未能獲有滿意之解釋、此間所可得之唯一說明、厥為此種消息來自日方、乃「志願為思想之母」的宣傳計畫之一部耳、華盛頓眞正消息靈通之各界、至今未見有此種妥洽之任何形跡、若干觀察家指陳、如此種妥洽行將成立、則總統何以尙未答復近衛私翰、此非奇異而何、國務卿赫爾在招待新聞記者時之談詁、在觀察家視之、顯已竭力吾認行將成立妥洽之傳說、並切實聲明美國政策仍以一九三七年七月及本年一月國會租借案審查會集議時美政府所發之官言為根據、此種對日政策之宜布、乃與第三國即中國至有關係者、日本侵華、乃美日關係緊張之主要源因、苟美日關係發生重要變更、則與中國有極密切之關係、此種糾紛之任何解決、苟不涉及中國或商諸中國、則似為不可能、今中國與其他方面、迄未有美政府已商諸中國之情報、尙有一事亦有關係者即澳洲是、雖國務院與澳代表間不乏密切之商榷、但澳代表似未對於美日談話之說表示過分之關切、此間華人未因一再傳出美日妥洽行將成立之說有所惶慮，而對於東京所傳重慶可與南京談判以期結束中日戰爭之消息、更嗤　以鼻、日方固不妨稱中日戰爭為偶發事件、但此事件之結束、自必由中日雙方討論之、此間消良靈通某方面稱、美國現不復願接受有所行動或無所行動之的言、以免此種的言、將來因日本藉口其國內政治之變更或其軍閥之異議而不予以屐行、如日本果表示採取某種行動之願意、則此步驟必為莫可反悔的步驟而後可、聞在此現巳進行之談話、業巳將此點使日政府充分明瞭之、而不容稍有誤會之可能、目前所可言者、試探性質之討論刻在進行中、華盛頓人士之眞正消息靈通者、皆不　在目前階段中之談話、可發生對日「休戰」之可能、換言之，彼等相信美日關係將依然停頓、　不較前改善、亦不必視前惡化、以日本仍將靜待觀望時機、而美國此時可無須應付太平洋之戰事、亦未始無益也、至於此種試探性質的談話在進行時、美國所加諸日本之經濟制裁可稍鬆懈一昼、則此間毫無此意、吾人當知最以對美關係惡化為懼者厥為日本、故此間人士不能見有犧牲美國或中國對日讓步　需要、東京所傳日方發言人所稱日本任令美幽油船駛抵海參崴、此乃日本對美友好之說、殆有其眞正價値、據衆所知、日本以蘇聯能得美國供給而日本則吾、頗覺惶慮、今日方發言人之言論、在熟悉遠東時局者觀之、乃掩飾其弱點之努力耳、</p>

<h3>美切實執行租軍案　中美合作益堅强　紐約組民治緊急會議社　召集大會促進保衛方策　滬觀察家認美日談判不足重視</h3>
<p>自美日進行試探性質之談判後、各方紛紛揣測後果、新聲針記者、詢諸滬上消息靈通之觀察家、據稱、因美日談判而引起之任何揣測、斷無可信或可重視之理由、中國自作戰以來、迄已四年有餘、成世界民立陣營之遠東堡壘、以使其他國家免受影饗、設無中國近四年之堅强毅力、則歐戰爆發後、南洋方面之英美利益將如何、俄國之東陲又將如何、美國豈不明瞭此一事實、何嘗願意損傷其自身傳統之利權、故不論美日談判如何、美國決不犧牲中國、郭外長十五日之言、可以證之、</p>
<p>中國不變　基本國策</p>
<p>美國固無以中國為犧牲之意嚮、中國亦決不致犧牲目身經四年血戰而獲得之榮譽地位、以及建國之權利、蔣委員長對此事曾有嚴正之表示、「余强調告吾人之美國友人、中國必不改變其　戰到底之政策、幷將再作必要之犧牲、至遠東及全世界確獲永久與公允之和平而後己、」中國在太平洋上之地位、已極重要、美國斷無背棄此一遠東之中流砥柱之理、中國基本國策、亦無任何改變、</p>
<p>美租軍案　切實執行</p>
<p>事實上、美國援華之政策、幷無因　日進行談判而呈减退之徴象、羅斯福總統十五日向國會提出之租軍案報告中稱、租軍程序之主要任務、為援助中國以及英國、該程序之目的、亦欲改進擴大及保障緊要物品運華之航路、維持中國國內交通、幷增强中國之空軍實力、目下派赴中國之重事使命團、將決定最適合中國戰情之防禦配備、幷保證所供配備之有效運用、羅總統正在對日談判過程中、提出有關援華程序之報告、無異嚴重之警告、中美之臺作益臻堅强、而合作之實力可使任何行為所望達到之結果成為泡影、總之、中國依舊在有和之國際環境中、自後外交軍事將處主動地位、期結成光明之果實、與達到向來之期望、</p>
<p>保衛民治　三國一致</p>
<p>美國民治緊急會議社、為美國者名無綫電台評論家格蘭史榮所發起、經史榮氏之努力、巳為全美政商學各界所注意、按該會議社之目的、純為應時勢之需求、　現時各民主國之公民、解釋現時民主國家抗建圖存之根本重要問題、使各民主國之公民認　參加並促進現時保衛民中政治之緊急工作、現據該會消息、謂紐的民治緊急會議、巳定於本月十九日晚七時半、在密地愼大會塲舉行、屆時與會者、將逾數萬人、會塲將由美國現任大理院審判官勞伴芝先生主席、前任港尼戚咭省省長洛士先生及其他名流單數十人、均將有慷慨激昂之演講、鼓勱民衆、保衛民治、列席人士、除美國公民外、將有多數英僑參加、惟該會以現時代表民主國精神之各國公民、除英美二國國民外、中國實為中流砥柱、是以此次緊急會議、不能無華人參加、因此該會特與助華總會中委會接洽、請其轉商華埠負責團體、代為邀請華僑參加、現在該委員會已與紐約總會接洽、請其轉飭華埠僑胞參加、為中華民族爭先云、</p>

<p>同時、　方今（十六日）晨繼續偵查伊凡諾夫被刺案、但尙未拘獲兇犯、衆信此案出於政治動機、警方對此、則守緘默、可靠方面謂、伊氏被刺、與星期夜俄人馬曼托夫遭狙擊案有</p>
<p>連帶關係</p>
<p>聞此兩案發生後、此間其他數俄人、其生命恐亦有危險者、現皆預事防範、上海白俄對於伊凡諾夫遭暗殺、頗有震驚、昨夜紛赴亨利路教堂禮拜、以示哀悼、俄人方面謂、伊凡諾夫係與白俄移民委員會前主席梅慈拉在相似之情勢中遇刺畢命、伊凡諾夫之屍體、或將下葬靜安寺公墓、但葬期未定、</p>

<h3>救世軍收容乞丐　工作愈趨艱巨　乞丐多不願捨原有生活　丐童更多頑悍難於管馭</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本市救世軍、刻正收容街頭乞丐、授以謀生自立之道、此項任務、頗稱艱旦、頃據救世軍駐滬首腦華克少校談稱、救世軍不能肅淸街頭乞丐、一如醫院不能根洽上海之疾病、固情况使然也、救世軍所能允諾者、爲以最切實之態度、對於乞丐</p>
<p>逐個　處置</p>
<p>之、救世軍自處理乞丐以來、業已照料乞丐二千八百餘名、救世軍之乞丐收容所、不營「淸理所」、酌量情形、與警方合作、將流落上海之鄉民、遣返故里、准許年靑力壯之乞丐、覓保離所、自謀生路、丐童則留所內、授以教育與成衣製鞋等工藝、所內女丐、繡織手套洗滌衣衫、少數較健壯之男丐、擔任搗石工作、每月可得十五元、此款於彼等出所時發給之、難民與乞丐救濟</p>
<p>工作　差別</p>
<p>厥爲難民乃自願不然、救世軍在滬辦理難民收容時、難民紛請收容、華北方面情形亦然、乞丐則多不願棄其乞食生活、故反對入所、一若被捕入獄者、且乞丐吸毒者頗多、入所後即不獲毒品、尙有許多乞丐、皆係小竊、允以丐童爲然、所內乞丐二百五十人、亦有少數專從卡車上竊取綿米等物者、寗受押車者之殿擊、但求竊得少許棉米逸去、乞丐之患病、</p>
<p>目盲　殘廢</p>
<p>者亦夥、盲丐乃一嚴重問題、絕少授以謀生技能或自立之望、旣無智職、目隊求乞外、並無他願、此等不辛之乞丐、現仍留所中、不許出外、但不久或有覔得解決辦法之望、殘廢與荏弱之乞丐、亦多不願留所、救世軍所遇另一嚴重間題、爲無家可歸之流浪丐童、若輩之犯法行爲、事雖微小、然規模頗大、收人所內、亦悍無懼色、甚至不從指示、會有</p>
<p>一羣　丐童</p>
<p>搗碎所內窗戶、頑强已極、不得不召到警員、加以約束、又有一次、丐童拒不上課、所方遂取堅決手段、不予飲食、丐童始肯入學、嗣經循循善誘、劣性大改、該所職業學校中、丐童已製鞋五百雙、衣千件、最近且造竹製品、至於從鄉間來滬流落求乞者、警員當然不能辨別、亦無法得知乞丐之過往歷史、但送入收容所後、所方即嚴密盤問其身世、凡係</p>
<p>鄉民　求乞者、類皆一鄉間情況不利、迫不得已來派滬謀生爲言、救世軍凡遇此種乞丐、即爲之攝影、領得通行證、送至車站或船上、給予車船票及一元現款、遺返故里前後已逾四百人、據警方調查所悉、遺返之乞丐、未有發現復在此間行乞者、且有返鄉後致函救世軍道謝者云、按華克少校係繼馬瑞山旅長而任上海區救世軍首腦、會在華北從事慈善工作、故對難民與乞丐之救濟工作、頗有經騐、</p>

<h3>金市場　祇賴現貨點綴　行情軋升百十元</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗市、轉趨昂升、乃美日暫時妥協與遠東絕對無關、各方人心復堅、期貨不滿二百兩交易、價由六千八百五十八元、升至六千八百七十二元、軋升十五元、現金重趨昂勢、乃上日晚收後價已做高、故中興售予熾大十兩，價巴升至八千九百元、計高六十元、俄又出德孚廿兩、八千八百九十元、卅兩八千九百十元、德孚又進福康、永十兩、中興卅兩、八千九百廿元永成進成記義豐各五十兩爲八千九百五十元義元進義豐廿兩、八千九百五十元、五十兩八千九百卅五元、又五十兩八千九百卅元、再進聯興十兩、八千九百五十元、永成進祥和六十兩、義豐五十兩、八千九百五十五元、正午祥和進義豐卅兩、立泰廿兩、合盛十兩、午收八千九百四十元、下午祥和進同康永廿兩、成記萬豐宏慶永各十兩、爲八千九百五十元、合盛進某錢莊十兩、爲八千九百七十元、祥和再進時和廿兩、天元義豐各十兩、後天元復進誠達十兩、永豐廿兩、均八千九百五十元、比上日軋升一百十元廿有八十元高低、交易六百餘兩、金號之本牌金、門市售價九千元、收進比售價低二百元、飾令軋升十元、爲九百廿元、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、晨十點升十元、爲九百二十元、收進减五十元云、</p>
<h3>證卷　內債所漲久　昨日稍見回風　外股市塲多謠</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市漲風已戢、信孚及同康雖買進尙湧無奈人心不齊、賣出有過之、市况直綫下降、丙種幾打破二元、趨勢已疲、暫時不易見好、人心動盪情形已顯露形跡、且看丙種二關能保持與否耳、昨上午新華信孚同康一貫買進、賣方則有九成聯益仁豐協康鼎康順泰等家、丙種由二元七角開盤後、會見二角半小價、午收雖有三角半、終屬勉强、午收信孚同康買進、仍有餘勇、且聯和潤利德隆樂茂益記等均有需要、鼎康繼續賣出、怡泰生大出籠、惹人注意、同順三開及協興元等均在紛紛求售、丙種會壓小至二元、僅以二元一角收盤、趨勢已疲、恐將再落、市價結果一致回小三角至六角、成交的二百三四十寓元茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火榮公司般　百股、價爲四十六元七角半、</p>
<p>衆業股市開槃尙堅、嗣即遂形軟化、中途曲折甚多，結果大致較前收略低、市塲人心仍佳、惟因各股經接連數日之激漲價格似已相當高昂、故一有謠言、同風頓起、前途恐尙多變幻、胥視時局爲轉移、</p>
<p>倫敦十五日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、祇銀行股獨呈起色、麥加利銀行股除息後新價為九鎊十先令、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股升半鎊、價爲七十七鎊半、又香港註冊股升六鎊、價爲八十五鎊、有行無市、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　和平傳說成烟幕　多頭急於進取奮不顧實銷呆頓</h3>
<p>上日大落之紗布、昨則午後又復回好、此因市場之流言、謂美日協定又迷離撲朔、於是投機的人們、心思轉好一步、檯風稍轉、扒補及翻多並起、但實際交易禾見十分進展、香港幫買去粗紗一百五十包、其他未聞成交、獨三二支及四二支紗綫價頻頻下降、日紗情况益覺衰弱、所以就目前狀况、市面深恐仍在七上八落之間、或有一度槃旋也、暫時不致於有大瞄頭來吧、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百三十二元、低價一千七百十五元、午後初開半平、爲一千七百三十二元、漸以取引所價回昂、隨之上升至一千七百四十四元、收槃價爲一千七白四十元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日收盤之盧風續進、首槃價爲一千七百十五元、價盤一開、扒補</p>
<p>蜂擁而來、立刻升至一千七百二十三元、嗣後取引所開盤趁昂、人心隨之挺秀、漲至一千七百三十二元、但客銷沉滯、在此二十八九元之間、迴旋頗　、收槃價為一千七百二十八　、查半日間成　統計八千一百三十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如、</p>
<p>香港　一三〇同行八、〇〇〇統計八、一三〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、於恍惚之消息中、跌而急升、反動殊覺有勁、全日起伏、亦達十一至十八元之間、當晨開出、先以美棉再降空氣初頗萎靡、廠單首先下跌、期紗人心隨之不振、浮多與空方仍多拋出、後以取引所　步轉挺、賣氣頓見减退、廠單直綫回昂、期紗激漲亦烈、允以靜觀之大戶、見速日之下瀉、價已頗低、故一露回升之鋒、即相爭收購、且連日多方所願忌之和平空氣、因本能經以有力之證實、不免使空方之憑籍發生浮盪、而多方因鑒於棉花根本之枯少、與價格之堅定、遂紛起愯羅與加碼、允以新多之購爲甚、是以市價先疲後堅、如消息上再見迷離、賣戶之潛力、恐暫减弱、是以脚地上已見轉穩、九月期開槃爲一六五〇元十月期爲一六五九元、十一月期一六七七元、午後回上、結果九月期爲一六五七元、收市軋漲四元五角、十月爲一六七三元、好起三元五角、十一月期爲一六八二元、突漲十五元之多、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>紗布好轉　棉市活躍</h3>
<p>現棉市况、初極平庸、午後紗市回好、氣象帶昂、交易亦突轉活躍、良以日前所謠太平洋和平探討、仍屬渺茫、復以滬埠存貨不厚、國鄉新棉因遭月來風雨摧殘、情形不佳、出數難望　稔、而咋日紗布價格均見好轉、廠方納胃漸見開展、致影響人心、化疑為堅、生意前况驀趨熱烈焉、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因有南方幇猛烈套賣之影響、同時又因缺乏重要買方、及氣候報告較前良好、市况略有下游、昨日牧槃價格、較之上日的跌十八九磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因現貨商售出而跌、旋因空頭抵補回漲、但最後市况再因棉商套賣、及浮多吐出而跌、結果收槃價格、各跌六七羅比不等、叉預測今日開盤、市况繼續看跌一羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况平淡交易稀少、大概因外匯結款問題未盡妥善、及海外裝棉噸位頗不易得、目下實少發展也、</p>
<h3>糧食　小絞米有　進百元關　再小三四五元</h3>
<p>昨洋米早晨開市、即承前晚之疲風、期現各米一致疲軟無神、實銷觀望、囤戶心虛、執有手貨者多主隨市貶脫以期早日了結、市上一片求賣聲、而進戶寥落、市面迄難好轉、繼因美日妥協之謠更盛傳於市、浮多競先求脫、大戶暗吐甚力、市乃再度瀉跌、雖有實銷本客趁低收買、而市價終難轉機、碎米會至七十六元半、小絞銀行棧小至一百元、外棧一般貨跌進百元大關、開九十八元、內地幫去之爪哇紅米亦降開九十七元、天津去之爪哇白米亦自一百十八元小至一百十六元、英華司小紋開一百二十九元半、現碎米祇八八十五元、此之前日收價再跌三四五元不等、午後雖有本容實銷與囤戶趁小問津、而市價起而復落、迄難站足、全日成交現米八九千包、英華司二百多噸、今日有洋米一千四百包、由太古新北京輪運往天津、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、值此洋米暴跌之際、庶亦備受影響、致本鄉店胃均見呆而鮮化、而貨主雖以到稀、亦難扳持、頓落二三元不等、計售南港早稻一百四十八元、次至一百四十五元、厚粳未開、浦東新粳一百五十一元半、一百五十一元、</p>
<p>糯米則一呼百諾、並難立足、相繼貶短二元左右、開香港特兀一百二十六元、普通一百二十三元至一百二十元、糯茶一百十元、</p>
<h3>海味　新到本港尾開盤</h3>
<p>本港　米最近已有運到一批昨巳開出、價為四百四十四元、較爲平宜、</p>
<p>干貝回跌後、昨有開出一千二百〇五元、即以叫價而論、已降二百元、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖市操緃得利害　到貨不絕：市價猛漲</h3>

<p>荷糖大宗到滬、渣華郵船公司芝沙路亞號、昨午抵埠、此决由爪哇來滬、全船均裝食糖計七千噸、的七萬餘包之鉅、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、今日有糖六千包、裝太古公司新北京輪運往天津、</p>
<h3>疋頭　日廠棉布　盛銷南洋　漲風又熾</h3>
<p>廠布昨市回漲力頗强、乃因午前盤旋微升、幫港需要增加、廠根甚緊、染廠及投機戶進意濃厚、市盤重見上抬、白貨粗細布斜紋漲五角至七角半、漂染布絨布漲五角至一元、怡和粗布廠盤期貨新價照現市高每疋一元半至三元餘、本街成交各布一千餘件、粤港幫辦色布色斜等五百餘件、南洋幫辦綸昌怡和等廠漂染布疋粗細布四百餘件、</p>
<p>東布漲風重起、期貨拉力尤猛、蓋以中下檔細布斜紋現貨、本街實銷續盛、售盤穩定、蓋因南幷一帶紛由上海口岸裝述大宗前往、且取引所之期布等級尙差低每疋兩元左右、故放空者咸具戒心、亟籌扒補、各月份一致軋高、回升每疋八九角之譜、現貨市塲龍頭細布新單仍售五十八元三角、四君子嗶嘰晨平午漲、收市新單售開一元二角五分、則較升每碼二分七五、</p>
<p>十七日有疋頭二百件、運烟台、又四件、運威海衛、</p>

<h3>十年</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>黯然銷魂者，惟別而已矣。在人情上講，一日三秋，何况十年，這一點，我想凡是在別離中的人們，都具同感</p>
<p>懷念，策勉，期待，在父子兄弟朋友言別的時候，都會從心坎裹湧起這種情緒，尤其是久別的人，這種感想，更加深切。</p>
<p>拿歷史來講，往事如昨，十年一瞬，中國建國五千年這短短的十年，僅僅是五百分之一的歷史。拿歷史所予人，類的教訓來講，中華民族有悠久之文化，有光榮的史實，任何艱難，任何困苦，都是勉勵來茲，發揚光大的因素。那末這十年的艱辛，也就是創造光明必然的遭遇。</p>
<p>十年，可貴的十年，可忻可喜可歌可泣的十年。語云「十年生聚，十年教訓，」中華民族有史以來，都是含辛茹苦，期以十年為復興之基。以昔視今，歷史當然愈艱辛，愈燦爛！</p>
<h3>多福多壽多男子　我是七個孩子的父親</h3>
<p>— 根發</p>
<p>「你們現在要到社會七去做人了！將來，二個變三個，三個變四個。負擔越來越重。總要加倍爭氣，勤儉，恒心，耐苦。做人是談何容易呀！」這是老父親十五年前吾倆離鄉來滬時的訓話。</p>
<p>十五年了！果然不出所料：無休無息，二年一個。如今，二個已經變成九個了！</p>
<p>帶領了這一羣，遷南徙北，趕東落西。租房屋十家有九家厭孩多不借。穿衣服一買就要七件。演晨早飯無着，買七八個大餅，每人只吃到一個。走親眷，游馬路，一連串，成羣結隊，活似一幅流民圖。現在，好容易找到了一個汽車間，全家老小，沙丁魚般塞在裹面。對面巨廈晨的太太們，聽見了小孩子的哭聲，幾次三番，下來責斥，聲言要把吾們這家孩子太嘈，人口太多的驅逐出去。</p>
<p>這一羣小流民，沒有享受，沒有娛樂，沒有保障。人們三娘四姨，前呼後擁。吾們侷促巷口，無枝可棲。人們醫藥診斷，牛奶補品。吾們稀粥果腹，病痛硬頂。人們有學校，有機會，以讀書為苦事，視求學為畏途。吾們天天走過學校，不得其門而入。好像除了維持這幾個小小生命之外，世界上再沒有其他前途，其他希望的了，可是，希望總是有的，吾以謂。歷史上驚天動地的大偉人，聽說大都是從低微困苦，荊棘叢生中長大起來的。因之，吾們以之自慰，吾們頗不願妄自菲薄。七個孩子當中，總有一個成功的。吾們竭力節省一些餘錢，計劃把來栽培其中最努力，最好學，最前進的一個。吾們把未來的希望，都寄託給他。吾們在目前的憂患困苦之中，孕育著將來的安慰和快樂。</p>
<p>（編者按）根發先生請了·很同情於先生拖帶「這一羣小流民」的艱難，在這時候眞不容易；但我更佩服您老人家的樂觀，有樂觀才能奮鬬而應付裕如。令郎雖苦，做人的機會却是均等的，所以同樣有出息。不過，也請您普遍地教育他們，要「我盡我心」，有粥吃大家吃粥，有飯吃大家吃飯；你揀中一個，把希望全槃交托他，那是「投機家」的立塲。您老人家有父親的義務，省得人家說你不大公平，是不是？</p>
<h3>善於「拒絕麻煩」</h3>
<p>— 江亭</p>
<p>據說，「善於拒絕麻煩」的民族那是優秀的民族，她的生命必將無窮。</p>
<p>如果世界上的人類，個個都能拒絕麻煩，那不是世界太平了嗎？我會經這樣想，不過我又不能保證在十六萬萬的全世界的人口中，是不是人人都肯拒絕麻煩。只要有少數中之極少數的人不怕「麻煩」，世界馬上就不會寗靜了。你看，世界上僅僅有了一個不怕麻煩的希特勒，連遠隔重洋的美國人都要為他忙個小休。雖然人人都是企求寗靜而討厭麻煩，可是在今日的世界中生活，又怎能拒絕麻煩。</p>
<p>不過，就人性上說，大家似乎是討厭麻煩，可是世界之有今日，人類之能進步，文化之能發達，也是人們不怕麻煩的結果。一切的發明，一切的創造，那一件不是麻煩的事，不僅是普通的麻煩，而且麻煩得透頂，我沒有聽說有那位科學家是怕麻煩的，我更沒有聽見說有那位學者那個成功的人物是怕麻煩的。</p>
<p>人類之能進步，是由於不怕麻煩，文化之能發達，也是由於人類的不怕麻煩。</p>
<p>在現代社會中生活，不能怕麻煩；在現代世界中求生存，更不能怕麻煩。</p>
<p>如果你拒絕麻煩，討厭麻煩，那就是表示你的沒出息，不長進。</p>
<h3>確實的</h3>
<p>— 白沫</p>
<p>我每天必往頭輪戲院，人家以為我有錢？其實拆穿了講，我去的原因並非看戲，乃是假裝去看看預告相片，享受些免費娛樂，作我的避煩勝地而已。</p>
<p>游泳池和溜冰塲沒有女人，按摩院，遊戲塲和大飯店沒有女招待，五者生意決不會興盛。</p>
<p>然而跳舞塲，禁止男子人內，那不久這舞塲也要宣告閉門了。</p>
<p>掌故譚</p>
<h3>狸案人物志</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>二　劉皇后</p>
<p>大凡有才貌出衆的女子，必是叉甜叉酸，又香又辣，儳能使英雄入彀，玩之於股掌之上，傾倒於石榴裙下。不過劉后究竟不失為典型人物，非可以淫蕩殘忍辜恩負義之武曌比。方其聽政時，小臣方仲弓上書請依武后故事立劉氏廟，程琳亦獻武后臨朝圖，后擲其書於地曰：吾不作此負祖宗事。可見劉后當年之被逐，無非為聲色惑主。至後宮所生子多不育，亦不能歸貢於劉后一人，蓋劉后早年尙處於妃嬪之列。其後有留養在外，大有非劉后子，不得為眞宗嗣，此則劉后之過也。眞宗之於劉后，由愛而懼，曲意相從，亦無可諱。然仁宗之得安享帝皇等榮四十一年，微劉后養育保護之力，恐不易得此。</p>
<p>劉后所不足者為無生育，美而無子，碩人之賦，劉后必與有同感焉！故其心目中所切念者，時思得一子以專寵固權。仁宗之生，旣距悼獻太子之死後七年，此一時期，劉后必尙在自望生育，後知其終無能為，乃思以李妃侍眞宗；仁宗生時，劉后巳為四十二歲不然，以蛾眉不肯讓人之劉后，豈肯臥榻之旁，容人鼾睡。蓋在宗法社會制度下，庶出之子，以主母為母，何况皇室。故李妃之得幸，劉后實縱容之，冀其有子，猶是利權不外溢之意也。</p>

<h3>Expanding US Aid to China: Assisting China in Strengthening its Air Force</h3>
<p>Supplying Ships to Transport War Materials to Rangoon: Publication of US Lend-Lease Act Progress Report</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt stated in his Lend-Lease Act report to Congress yesterday that the largest task in the program is to aid China and Britain. In the chapter on "Scope of Lend-Lease Act Aid," it states that the purpose of the Lend-Lease Act is to "improve, extend, and secure the routes for transporting war materials to China." The President stated that the US Maritime Commission has supplied cargo ships to China and transported goods to Rangoon, as this is the only major import route to free China. President Roosevelt stated that basic steps have been implemented to maintain China's land transportation. He proposed transporting road-building materials for the Burma Road. He said that aid for the Chinese highway truck project under the Lend-Lease Act is increasing daily. The report also mentioned that gasoline, oil, and truck parts have been shipped to China. The report also stated that the Burma Road was built with unlimited manpower and received initial assistance. Now, the railway is being extended to Yunnan Province, a malarial area, but the US Public Health Service is taking care of the workers' health problems there. The President also stated that in order to protect China's highways, railways, airfields, and cities from repeated bombings, modern fighter planes are urgently needed. Therefore, over the past year, Lend-Lease Act contracts have been signed to transport aircraft and other aircraft components to China. President Roosevelt stated that a military mission has departed for China to confer with Chinese military authorities. The mission will also determine the war tools most suitable for China, which can enable China to achieve maximum war effectiveness.</p>
<p>Aid to Resist Aggression: Twelve Countries Receive Assistance</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt reported to Congress yesterday that the supplies delivered under the US Lend-Lease program to countries resisting the Axis powers totaled $190,447,670 as of the end of August. However, the supplies already transferred, including those currently awaiting shipment, still amount to $35,946,701, and other services such as repairing warships have also reached $78,169,377. The cost of service equipment not yet completed still reaches $162,000,000. The value of defense equipment already transferred and defense services already provided in August, plus the cost of other Lend-Lease uses, totals US$487,000,000. Aircraft, tanks, artillery, and ships are now beginning to flow out of American factories, and this outflow will increase daily until it accumulates into rivers and seas, sweeping away the totalitarianism that seeks to dominate the world. Most of these supplies are shipped to Britain, but approximately twelve countries have received American aid, including China, Poland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands (including the Dutch East Indies), Brazil, and the Dominican Republic. The President also stated that this is not a matter of charity or sympathy. We are making this contribution because we know that resisting aggression alone will lead to failure. To break the brutal war machine that is now ravaging Europe, we must rely on the united efforts of all free people in all places where aggressors can be attacked, otherwise it will not work. Goods under the Lend-Lease program are shipped as quickly as possible when they are available for export. Including what Britain has funded itself, Britain has actually received goods worth approximately $4,400,000,000 since the outbreak of the war. However, the US production rate must be accelerated, and we must take all kinds of steps to achieve this goal. Part of the funds under the Lend-Lease program have been allocated for the construction of naval and land bases for Britain, amounting to approximately $12,000,000. Bombers that have been ordered and started construction are worth approximately $1,000,000,000. Aircraft and aircraft parts account for more than one-third of all war equipment ordered under the Lend-Lease program. The United States has supplied China with many trucks, cargo ships for transporting war materials, and raw materials for repairing the Yunnan-Burma Road. Equipment and supplies under the Lend-Lease program are also helping the Yunnan Railway, and new fighter planes will strengthen the Chinese Air Force under the Lend-Lease Act contracts established in the past three months. In addition, other countries that have received assistance include: (1) Poland: guns, ammunition, clothing, and self-defense equipment for merchant ships; (2) Greece: new equipment for Greek troops who fled to British territory in the Middle East; (3) Yugoslavia: naval and land equipment for the Southern Army in the Middle East; (4) Norway: mine protection, anti-aircraft guns, and submarine artillery required for merchant ships, as well as repairs for damaged ships; (5) Belgium: reconnaissance vehicles, machine guns, aircraft, and hospital equipment required for the Belgian Congo and the Free Belgian Army; (6) The Netherlands: military weapons, gunpowder, aircraft, warships, tanks, and commodities required for the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Destroying Nazi Forces: Decision to Expand Aid to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 16th: All of the President's statements are described in a letter to Vice President and Senate President Wallace and Rayburn. The letter stated that Britain has received a large amount of aid from our country, but other countries resisting aggression have also received aid from our country. The President stated that our program of assisting China and the Dutch East Indies is gradually increasing. Governments of countries expelled by the Nazis and countries in the Southern Hemisphere are also eligible for the Lend-Lease Act. The President's letter also stated that the Soviet people's brave resistance has provided great assistance to the people resisting the Nazis. It also stated, "We have done our best to supply the Soviet Union's needs with possible items. The Soviet Union's resistance is like resisting for the United States. We are aiding the Soviet Union because gradual resistance is bound to fail. The inhumane war to control Europe can only be fought with the combined forces of all free people." The President also stated, "Construction contracts for bombers worth US$100,000,000 have been signed, and work will begin in a short period of time. New methods of building merchant ships have begun, and new merchant ships worth $500,000,000 are under construction." It continued, "New methods to increase the speed of guns, ammunition, and other defense items have begun, and contracts worth a total of US$262,000,000 have been signed." It also stated that "the Soviet Union's purchases here are made by its regular purchasing agencies with its own funds." The letter also stated, "The American people know that we cannot survive in a world under the control of Hitlerism. They know that unless this evil force is destroyed, we cannot have true peace and security." The President's letter also stated that the Lend-Lease Act is not a one-sided effort included in our country's defense or armament. This is the entire essence of our country's efforts to preserve national comfort and eliminate those who disrupt our peace for future generations. The United States is now included in the largest and most effective industrial country in history. We will do our best to create a war industry. This is the only way we can build our arsenal of democracy.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States: Maintaining Maritime Traffic</p>
<p>In addition to his report to Congress, the President attached a letter stating that the United States has chartered a large number of cargo ships and oil tankers for the use of countries whose defense is closely related to US national defense. US shipyards are also repairing damaged merchant ships for the Allied countries. The United States is also installing equipment to defend against mines, aircraft, submarines, and raiding ships on Allied ships. It is also repairing and equipping Allied warships. In addition, it is helping the British and Allied navies clear necessary sea lanes. The repair of the British battleship "Malaya" and the aircraft carrier "Illustrious" is one of the proofs of naval assistance. The United States is also providing Britain and other countries resisting the Axis powers with important defense information. The transatlantic business of American aircraft, spanning the Americas and Africa, is now connecting American arsenals and civilized countries with outposts in the Middle East. Thousands of British pilots are currently receiving training at American airfields. We are now preparing a similar program to assist China. The defense of the Western Hemisphere is the first consideration of the Lend-Lease program. We are not only assisting European countries resisting the Nazis to prevent them from advancing to the Western Hemisphere, but we are also strengthening Iceland's defense to provide direct Lend-Lease assistance to countries in the Western Hemisphere. We have begun a large-scale program to provide material assistance to countries in Central and South America to strengthen common defense (Reuters).</p>
<p>US Goods Transported to China: Tax Exemption for Goods Passing Through Burma</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 16th: Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan publicly released a letter from the Secretary of State yesterday, stating that freight transported via the Burma-Yunnan Highway under the Lend-Lease Act is now tax-exempt. Vandenberg said that the letter was in response to his question. Hull said that before August 27, such freight should be taxed, and after August 27, a transit tax of ten rupees (East Indian silver coins) per ton would be charged. Hull's letter stated, "Our embassy in London reported on September 7 that the British Foreign Office has notified that all US Lend-Lease goods transported to China are exempt from transit tax after being unloaded in Rangoon on September 3."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On US-Japan Negotiations</h3>
<p>Given Japan's current international situation, it not only welcomes negotiations with the United States, but also hopes to achieve its own goals through a strategy of divide and conquer with any of the countries in the Far East anti-aggression front, such as China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. Therefore, fundamentally, it has to insist on two points: first, the opponent must be individual, and second, the negotiation object must be partial. It not only opposes attending the collective meetings of anti-aggression countries and accepting everyone's condemnation of it; at the same time, even if any country in the anti-aggression front wants to make Japan accept its views on the entire Far East situation, it is probably completely impossible. In short, Japan's intention to engage in negotiations with the United States is still to use the usual individual break-through technique, attempting to first ease the crisis with the United States, wait for the appropriate time, and then arrange a major attack on any part of the anti-aggression front. This point is beyond any doubt.</p>
<p>What inevitably raises considerable questions is the US side. The first is the issue of motivation. If the United States' intention to engage in negotiations with Japan is to resolve the entire chaotic situation in the Far East in one fell swoop, then, assuming that there is no consistent understanding and arrangement with China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries in advance, this one action is obviously fundamentally impossible. However, judging from the various reactions of countries since the start of the US-Japan negotiations, not only has China expressed deep concern, but the Soviet Union has remained silent; even the Dutch East Indies, which constitutes one of the most important targets for Japan's southward advance, has not expressed anything, and Britain, which shares common interests with the United States, has not seen any parallel concrete actions except for a casual mention in Churchill's speech. If the United States is holding negotiations with Japan and temporarily easing the crisis in the East in order to concentrate its efforts on dealing with Europe, then this negotiation should have been held before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and not today, when the Soviet Union has clearly joined the anti-aggression front on both the European and Asian sides. If the United States has seen Japan's current international predicament, and is therefore taking the opportunity to take the lead and use international common pressure to first obtain its own individual interest guarantees, then this not only violates the international obligations and morals of consistent and coordinated action on the anti-aggression front, but also absolutely contradicts the United States' consistently open and upright diplomatic tradition, and, further, may disrupt the front itself and lead to its own disadvantage. These are all things that general observers cannot understand. Also, the content of these US-Japan negotiations is still an impenetrable mystery to this day. This is a very disturbing phenomenon: on the one hand, if there are no places that are unfavorable to the other countries, there is certainly no absolute need for secrecy; on the other hand, as members of the anti-aggression front, the authorities and people of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries all have the right and obligation to demand knowledge. Therefore, the environment and process of the United States' decision to hold negotiations with Japan must be considered a misstep. The only point that is worth reassuring to everyone is the US authorities' explanation of the "exploratory" nature of the US-Japan negotiations in the past two days. In terms of motivation, it is hoped that the United States originally had no specific opinions in the initial negotiations, and the only meaning was to explore Japan's attitude, and then jointly determine the negotiation plan with China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. In terms of content, it is also hoped that because there was originally no specific content, there is nothing to announce. Therefore, in terms of method, the negotiations between the United States and Japan are only a temporary opening nature, and any international actions in the Far East in the future must still appear in the form of collaboration on the anti-aggression front. Of course, from this perspective and limit, we should not find anything worth opposing in this contact between the United States and Japan; therefore, for the further explanation given by Washington officials the day before yesterday, we believe that this exploratory effort itself is equivalent to forming a US-Japan "quiet agreement" that temporarily does not resort to war. Only one limited requirement needs to be added. That is, whether in substance or form, it must stop there. In terms of interpretation, no further extensions can be allowed, and even for "exploratory" negotiations of the same nature, it is hoped that they will never appear again.</p>
<p>What needs to be discussed here is the revival of appeasementism. In terms of the United States' decision to negotiate with Japan, it certainly has no reason to hope that everyone will not have the impression that appeasementism is being revived. However, what is worth distinguishing is that the fundamental essence is very different. Regardless of the appeasementism of the British Chamberlain faction or the American isolationist faction, in essence, they are both active assertions, rather than purely passively succumbing to violence. Under their self-contained system of overall views on the world situation, they proposed the appeasement proposition to the aggressors in the East and West. Of course, the major premise is that they do not believe that the aggressors will form an irreconcilable conflict with their own countries, and therefore, they are prepared to allow the aggressors to partition the weak countries and nations, and ultimately promote conflict with the Soviet Union. However, today's situation has fundamentally changed completely. Roosevelt and Churchill have repeatedly declared to the world the severity of the crisis formed by the aggressors against the United States and Britain. And restoring the sovereignty and integrity of all invaded countries, and cooperating with the Soviet Union to the end, have formed the two major pillars of the future policies of Britain and the United States. Restoring appeasementism is equivalent to recognizing the principle of international aggression. Outstanding world politicians like Roosevelt and Churchill will never take such actions.</p>
<p>Finally, China's position in this US-Japan negotiation situation is the same as how the United States' specific interest estimates for China may not be the same as China's views. Of course, China's opinions on the United States' own interests may not be the same as the United States. But there are at least two points that are the same between the two countries: one is anti-aggression, and the other is cooperation in rebuilding the world. Under these two fundamental agreements, China and the United States must not only be loyal to each other, but also have the right and obligation to demand loyalty from each other.</p>
<h3>Washington Adopts a Firm Stance: US-Japan Negotiations Temporarily Stalled</h3>
<p>Conciliatory Atmosphere Originates from Japanese Propaganda: Public Expects US Not to Disregard Chinese Opinions</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 15th: Well-informed sources here recently stated that US-Japan negotiations have been shelved due to several questions raised by Washington. The content of the initial agreement, originally scheduled to be announced within days, has also been implicitly cancelled. It is said that Prime Minister Konoe originally planned to deliver a radio speech on the evening of the 10th or 11th of this month to explain the situation of the negotiations with the United States, and then President Roosevelt would respond to it in a speech on the 12th of this month. At the same time, the spokesman of the Japanese government information bureau would announce it to the press, but all of this has been cancelled. Although the nature of the deadlock in US-Japan negotiations is not known, people here believe that the future of the negotiations is not hopeless.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th: News from the Far East that Tokyo and Washington are about to reach a broad compromise and that US-Japan relations are on a friendly basis has not been satisfactorily explained by well-informed sources here. The only explanation that can be obtained here is that such news comes from the Japanese side and is part of a propaganda plan to "let the wish be the father of the thought." All circles in Washington who are truly well-informed have not yet seen any signs of such a compromise. Some observers pointed out that if such a compromise is about to be reached, then why has the President not yet replied to Konoe's private letter? How can this not be strange? In the eyes of observers, Secretary of State Hull's remarks when hosting news reporters have clearly tried to deny the rumors of an impending compromise and earnestly declared that US policy is still based on the official statements issued by the US government during the Congressional Lend-Lease Act review meetings in July 1937 and January of this year. This announcement of the policy toward Japan is closely related to a third country, namely China. Japanese aggression against China is the main source of tension in US-Japan relations. If a major change occurs in US-Japan relations, it will be very closely related to China. Any resolution of this dispute that does not involve or consult with China seems impossible. Today, China and other parties have no information that the US government has consulted with China. Another matter that is also relevant is Australia. Although there has been close consultation between the State Department and Australian representatives, the Australian representatives do not seem to have expressed excessive concern about the US-Japan talks. The Chinese here have not been alarmed by the repeated rumors that a US-Japan compromise is about to be reached, and they scorn the news from Tokyo that Chongqing can negotiate with Nanjing to end the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese side may as well call the Sino-Japanese War an accidental event, but the end of this event must be discussed by both China and Japan. A certain well-informed source here said that the United States is no longer willing to accept vows of action or inaction, lest such vows may be reneged in the future due to Japan's excuse of changes in its domestic politics or the dissent of its military cliques. If Japan really expresses its willingness to take certain actions, then this step must be an irreversible step before it can be done. It is heard that in the current talks in progress, this point has been fully made clear to the Japanese government, and there is no room for any misunderstanding. What can be said at present is that exploratory discussions are currently underway. All those who are truly well-informed in Washington do not believe that the talks in the current stage can lead to a "truce" with Japan. In other words, they believe that US-Japan relations will remain stalled, not improving or worsening compared to before. It may not be without benefit for Japan to continue to wait and see for opportunities, and for the United States to have no need to deal with the war in the Pacific at this time. As for whether the economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Japan during these exploratory talks can be slightly relaxed, there is no such intention here. We must know that the most feared thing for Japan is the deterioration of relations with the United States, so people here cannot see the need to sacrifice the United States or China's concessions to Japan. The Japanese spokesperson's statement reported by Tokyo that Japan allows US oil tankers to sail to Vladivostok is probably of its true value as a statement of Japanese friendship toward the United States. As everyone knows, Japan is quite alarmed that the Soviet Union can get US supplies while Japan cannot. In the eyes of those familiar with the Far East situation, today's remarks by the Japanese spokesperson are an effort to cover up their weakness.</p>
<p>Wakasugi Returns Hastily to Assume Office: Special Envoys Accompanying Him</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: Wakasugi, the Japanese ambassador to the United States without a fixed term, returned home two weeks ago to report on his duties. After consulting with senior naval personnel and government officials in his country for many times, and holding at least one important meeting with US Ambassador Grew, he has now returned to the United States. Ishii, an information bureau spokesperson, announced this matter this morning when hosting news reporters. He said that the officer set sail yesterday, accompanied by a special commissioner from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he did not allow the disclosure of the person's name, position, or mission in Washington. Ishii also answered questions, saying that the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union have not responded to the questions raised regarding Japan's supply of goods to Vladivostok. He also said that he could not say when the Japanese government will send someone to fill the vacancy of the ambassador to Britain. Finally, he answered questions, saying that the small-scale trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are still ongoing in Batavia.</p>
<p>Eastern Newspaper Warns: Do Not Fall Into the American Trap</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th: Tokutomi, a famous commentator, published an article in "Daily News" stating that Britain and the United States are now making suggestions to Japan because they cannot bear to fight in the ocean. The true policy behind the effort for "appeasement" is to prevent Japan from advancing. Britain is now following the United States in various policies toward Japan, because Churchill wants to drag the United States into the war, and President Roosevelt is trying to promote his country's participation in the war in order to achieve his goal of "inheriting" the British Empire. If Japan can see this point, everything will be very good. However, if it cannot, then it does not know what kind of trap it will encounter.</p>
<h3>Duff Cooper Praises China's Resistance: The Far East Anti-Aggression Line is Strong; Japan is Isolated and Helpless</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th: Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative for the Far East, praised China's resistance yesterday. Cooper, commenting on the Soviet Union's twelve weeks of fighting against Germany, said that the Chinese people, one of the most peace-loving nations in the world, also evoked the world's admiration for their success in resisting the modern-equipped army that invaded China for four years without giving up.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th: Duff Cooper, the British Cabinet's representative for the Far East, broadcast to London yesterday, describing his first impressions of the Far East. He said that the Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean in the world, and the collection of all the land in the world cannot compare to its vastness. It seems that the Pacific world should play a greater role in human events than the Atlantic Ocean. Today, only one country in the Pacific is attached to the Axis powers, and the rest support the Allied cause. Their power is extremely great. China has 400 million people who have been stimulated by the invasion, and their patriotism has erupted, and they have gained a new understanding of unity and maintained their independence, thus resolving to get rid of their enemies. The Dutch East Indies is a beautiful and rich place, and the Dutch have shown in the sea, land, and air that they have not forgotten their former military glory. The Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia and is almost an invincible fighter. The United States has 130 million people who are committed to destroying autocracy and supporting Britain, and the British Empire has the support of Australia and New Zealand, and is willing to assist the Allies with all its strength. The power of these countries is terrifying. A year ago, the Soviet Union was still connected to the Axis powers, and the United States was not yet prepared to maintain freedom and justice, but today the situation has completely changed. Once so many great countries act together to deal with any event, there is no doubt about the outcome. The above remarks are actually a warning to Japan, because Japan is isolated and a single country cannot compete with the great powers.</p>

The Governor-General replied that Mr. Xu's appointment will not only maintain the friendly relations between China and Australia but will also expand them. The *Min Sheng Daily* commented that the lofty courage and determination displayed by the Chinese people in resisting Japan's attempts at conquest are historically unprecedented.

<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the Northeast Incident: Expanded Commemoration Held: China's War Aims Against Japan: To Safeguard National Territorial Integrity</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At its regular meeting yesterday morning, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang passed a temporary motion to hold an expanded commemoration on "September 18th" to mark the tenth anniversary of the Mukden Incident. The situation on that day is bound to be spectacular. The anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War was previously decided by the Central Executive Committee to be held jointly on "July 7th." The current resolution is a strong indication that China has not forgotten the three northeastern provinces. Observers speculate that this is related to the US-Japan talks. The United States does not engage in secret diplomacy, but this time, it has been unusually tight-lipped. Japan's war against China has been costly, and it is determined not to withdraw empty-handed before being defeated. The fact that it is enthusiastic about these talks suggests that China's move at this time is not without purpose. Chiang Kai-shek's speech on the 10th is of great significance in history. His urgent reiteration of China's war aim of driving the Japanese out of the country is perhaps necessary. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Shangqing's Remarks</p>
<p>Chongqing: The *Xinhua Daily* published remarks by Liu Shangqing, stating, "It has been a full ten years since 'September 18th.' It is not enough for everyone to write articles and give speeches as usual for the commemoration. We must 'do' something. Recovering the Northeast is not only the fervent hope of our compatriots in the Northeast and the call of the nation, but also the goal of our struggle. The prerequisite for doing so is the unity of the nation. Some people are pessimistic about the US-Japan talks, but I don't think so. As long as we do a better job with our national policy of self-reliance, we will make better friends." Liu is an important figure from the Northeast, who served as Minister of Interior of the National Government, and is now a 72-year-old member of the National Government.

<h3>Red Army in the Kiev Region Adopts Elastic Defense Tactics: Inflicts Significant Casualties on Offensive German Forces: Fierce Fighting Continues on the Outskirts of Leningrad</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Here, the German threat to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, is given much attention. The German High Command apparently intends to re-apply the pincer offensive in the area. So far, there are no extremely important towns that must be defended at all costs in the areas where fighting has occurred on the outer defensive lines of the Kiev region. Therefore, Soviet forces may as well fight and retreat while inflicting maximum casualties on the enemy. This "elastic defense" method has proven to be quite successful. Only the Soviet forces in Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) and Odessa have not avoided encirclement by German forces. However, both places can have reinforcements and military supplies transported from the sea to Tallinn. The Soviet forces will only retreat when they can no longer resist. Odessa, on the other hand, is still being held, and it seems likely that it will be able to be held for a long time. The situation in Leningrad is not quite the same, as the Soviets claim that although the city is under serious threat, it has not been completely surrounded. Kiev is also currently under threat. The Soviet forces apparently have no intention of withdrawing from the area but will rely on indomitable spirit, strong defenses, and the harshness of winter to deter the German forces. Currently, the German forces are apparently concentrating all their efforts on the attack in order to achieve a victory that will determine the outcome of the war before the imminent winter. The Mermansk area in the Arctic Ocean has already had its first snowfall, and the temperature in the south is very low, indicating that the severe winter will arrive early. A harsh winter is most favorable to the defending forces, as the Soviet forces are not only resistant to the cold but also have better shelters and cold-weather equipment.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 16th: An authoritative military spokesman said yesterday that the great battle of Leningrad is taking place on the outskirts, less than fifteen miles from the center of the city. Soviet troops are currently resisting desperately to defend every inch of land. Due to incessant heavy rain, the transportation of German military supplies and heavy equipment has become very difficult. Currently, Leningrad is defended by a chain of sentry boxes, which have six-foot-thick walls and steel embrasures. Their defensive lines are also equipped with tank traps six feet deep and nine feet wide, covered with branches and weeds. Since the German forces first threatened Leningrad after occupying the Baltic states, the residents of Leningrad, both men and women, young and old, have been engaged in digging defensive fortifications. German military sources also said that the Soviets have also established a number of field defense projects, built with tree trunks, branches, and the like, with land mines underneath and barbed wire in front. The military spokesman also said that General Leeb's troops had broken through multiple lines and penetrated deep into the Soviet defenses in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th: The German High Command issued a special announcement today stating that to the south of Lake Ilmen, the elite troops of the Soviet 11th, 27th, and 34th Armies were recently defeated by German forces and German aircraft commanded by Lieutenant General Busch and Lieutenant General Keller. Nine divisions of the enemy were completely annihilated, and several other divisions suffered heavy losses. A total of over 53,000 enemy troops were captured. The enemy lost 320 tanks and 695 cannons.</p>
<h3>German Landing at the Entrance to the Gulf of Riga Fails</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: A recent Soviet communiqué stated that the German forces attempted to land on the island of Osel at the entrance to the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea yesterday, but failed at a great cost. Soviet forces repulsed the German landing attempt, sinking four German transport ships and one destroyer, and heavily damaging two transport ships and several destroyers. In addition, fierce fighting continued across the entire front yesterday. Soviet aircraft bombed the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanza.</p>
<h3>Nazi Losses in Two Months of Operation: 8,000 Tanks</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th: Moscow Radio broadcast yesterday about the enormous losses of German tanks on the Eastern Front. It was said that Goebbels used to rely on the misconception that German tanks were invincible. While this may have been true when German forces were fighting isolated and weak countries in Western Europe, it has been completely disproven in the war against the Soviet Union. During the first week of the German operation against the Soviet Union, their losses in tanks could still be replenished. However, after three weeks of operation, Hitler had already lost twelve tank divisions, and after two months, he had lost 8,000 tanks. These figures are only the beginning of the huge losses that the German forces will suffer.</p>
<h3>500,000 Elite German Troops Transferred from the Western Front to the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Due to heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German forces have been forced to transfer nearly 500,000 of their elite troops from France, Holland, and Belgium. According to estimates by well-informed sources here, before the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the number of troops stationed in France, Holland, and Belgium was between forty and fifty divisions. Unexpectedly, as a result of the valiant resistance of the Soviet forces, the losses were unexpectedly heavy, and the elite troops transferred to and from have reached 400,000 to 500,000. The German High Command may even transfer older and younger soldiers to supplement the troops stationed in France, Holland, and Belgium, in order to transfer soldiers aged 25 to 35 for combat on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>Soviet Women Do Not Yield to Men: Great Achievements Are Laudable and Tragic</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Moscow, 16th: Yesterday's news here was that the partisan forces in Belarus are becoming increasingly active. In August, thousands of German troops were annihilated. In the Pinsky Province, partisan forces destroyed 20 warehouses, patrolled 16 tanks, 115 supply trucks, and 100 cargo cars carrying ammunition.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: London heard yesterday on Moscow Radio that Soviet women are participating in partisan warfare, and it was said that a fifteen-year-old girl in a village was beaten to death by German soldiers. As a result, 18 women rose up to take revenge. They climbed onto the roof of the building where the German troops had set up their headquarters, knocked down the sentry, poured kerosene all over the house, and set it on fire. Three German officers who escaped from the house were all killed. One was reportedly axed to death by a 16-year-old milkmaid.</p>
<h3>US Amends Neutrality Act: Allows Ships to Sail to War Zones: The Middle East, Near East, and British Territories: Official Interpretation Includes All</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 16th: The State Department announced yesterday that US ships will henceforth carry war supplies and passengers to most of the United Kingdom, an act previously prohibited by the Neutrality Act. At the same time, it was learned that President Roosevelt had discussed with congressional leaders the possibility of amending the Neutrality Act. House Speaker Rayburn declared that the issue would be discussed, but did not clarify whether President Roosevelt emphasized allowing ships to enter combat zones or arming ships. The State Department stated that allowing US ships to transport supplies and passengers to "the British Empire" only applies to England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It also stated that President Roosevelt previously referred to "the British Empire" when announcing that Germany had declared a state of war with "France, the British Empire, India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa." On the other hand, according to the Neutrality Act, US ships are not allowed to travel to the aforementioned areas. State Department officials refused to specify which specific areas US ships could travel to under the new interpretation, but they believe that it will include Aden, Egypt, the Malayan Straits Settlements, British Somaliland, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>
<h3>British and American Consultations: Aid to the Soviet Union: Delegations from Both Countries Will Go to the Soviet Capital Together</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Averell Harriman, head of the US mission to Moscow, arrived in the UK yesterday with three members of the mission. Harriman said, "We are eager to travel to Moscow as soon as possible within the realm of possibility." Today, the US mission will consult with Lord Beaverbrook, leader of the British mission. Upon Harriman's arrival in the UK, he was greeted by British Foreign Secretary Eden, Minister of Supply Beaverbrook, Undersecretary of Aviation Balfour, US Ambassador Winant, Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky, Soviet Ambassador to the US Oumansky, and other dignitaries. The members of the US mission who came with him were US Navy Admiral Standley, Army Major General Burns, and Batt from the Production Management Office.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: All tanks and tank parts manufactured in the UK next week will be shipped directly to the Soviet Union to defend the front lines of Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa. This new expression of the UK's full support for the Soviet Union was announced by Minister of Supply Beaverbrook in a telegram to workers at all tank factories. He said, "I urge you to do your utmost to work diligently and without delay. From now on, British tank factories must not only supply tanks to the British army but also supply the Soviet army, which is now fighting for the same glorious cause. Therefore, starting next Monday, September 22, the tanks you manufacture within seven days will be shipped to the front lines defending Leningrad, Kiev, and Odessa to participate in the battle."</p>
<h3>Japan Assembles Heavy Troops on the Korean Border: Seriously Threatens Vladivostok: Koreans Contribute Ideas to America</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 16th: The representative of the "Korean-Chinese United Association" stationed here wrote to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, drawing attention to Japan's base at Najin (transliteration) in Korea, which is only 150 miles away from Vladivostok, a key Soviet port for shipping supplies. Mr. Han stated that Japan has stationed 50,000 troops, 350 aircraft, and 12 submarines in Najin. He claimed that Najin is now one of the three most important bases of the Japanese Empire. Vladivostok is the only ice-free port in the Soviet Union in the North Pacific. Unless the United States and the Soviet Union take the initiative, the port will inevitably be threatened by the Japanese war machine. Mr. Han said, "We would like to present our humble opinion and request consultation with the Soviet Union for the US military to take over Vladivostok and the Kamchatka Peninsula, just as Iceland."</p>
<h3>The King of Iran Declares Abdication, Crown Prince Inherits the Throne</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Reuters, London. The King of Iran has announced his abdication, and the throne will be succeeded by the eldest son, the Crown Prince.</p>

<h3>Ge Zhaotong Successfully Researches Electric Indexing Machine, Making Great Contributions to Culture and Scholarship</h3>
<p>Ge Zhaotong, the inventor of the practical indexing machine, has recently greatly improved the hand-cranked indexing machine he previously invented based on his painstaking research. Now, this machine can not only index Chinese books from ancient times to the present, but also be used to index books from any country in the world. When the indexing machine was first invented, there was only the hand-cranked type. After continuous research, several different forms have been obtained. The most important of these is the successful research and development of the electric indexing machine. The electric indexing machine only requires the indexer to insert a special, ingenious key into the machine according to the text of the information they want to find, and turn on the power switch. Then, the information you want to find in any book, whether Chinese or foreign, can be found within a few minutes. For example, if you want to find out which book the sentence "A sage will arise every hundred years" comes from, you can use a special key to insert it into the machine and shake the indexing machine by hand or electricity. After shaking, you can get a slip of paper from the back of the machine or a piece of paper from the drawer at the bottom of the machine. Both the slip of paper and the piece of paper are printed with "Meng Gong 122, 3, 11-18", meaning Mencius, Gongsun Chou chapter, page 122, line 3, the eleventh to eighteenth characters. The electric indexing machine is most suitable for indexing a large number of books from ancient times to the present, both Chinese and foreign, because it rotates quickly and saves time. The hand-cranked practical indexing machine has also been improved into a sophisticated machine. When the hand-cranked indexing machine was first invented, one hand had to crank the machine and the other hand had to type the numbers. Now, the number typing part has been changed to automatic, meaning that only one hand needs to crank the machine, and the numbers can be automatically typed on the paper strip without the need for human hands. This saves both eyesight and hand strength. Culture and scholarship are developed and progressing in various European and American countries, but there is still no complete index book. Although there is a Bible index, it can only search for sentences, like Ye Shaojun's Thirteen Classics Index. Furthermore, there are many books in China that need to be indexed, such as the Thirteen Classics, the philosophers, the Twenty-Four Histories, Compendium of Materia Medica, the Three Principles of the People, etc. There is a Chinese proverb that says, "Where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories?" Now that the indexing machine has been invented, any word, sentence, or chapter title in the Twenty-Four Histories can be indexed. Newspapers and magazines can also be incorporated into the indexing machine. Chapter titles with special and obvious marks can be found, which is also a special feature of the indexing machine and makes a great contribution to world culture and scholarship. According to Mr. Ge, he would not be willing to give up his invention rights even for a price of ten thousand U.S. dollars.</p>

<h3>Points Handicap Basketball Finals: Shanghai Star Wins First Game Against Tongren; Second Game Scheduled for This Friday</h3>
<p>The second Points Handicap Basketball Tournament began its finals yesterday. Shanghai Star faced Tongren at 6 PM at the Paramount Ballroom. Because Shanghai Star is one of the top four teams in Shanghai and has a strong lineup, they gave up as much as twenty points even in the finals stage. Tongren is a rising star, with the four outstanding Yi brothers and the fierce general Jiang Shuliang, making their lineup also quite solid. The game was extremely tense. Liang Yunming and Chen Bangzhen of Shanghai Star and Xuan Jun of Tongren were evenly matched. In the first half, Shanghai Star scored thirty points and Tongren scored twenty-two points, but due to the handicap, Shanghai Star was still at a disadvantage with thirty points against forty-two. After switching sides, the players of Shanghai Star launched coordinated attacks, and Tongren struggled to defend. They relied on Jiang Shuliang and Xuan Tong to work hard to regain some ground. In the end, Shanghai Star won the first victory with seventy-eight points against sixty-five. The second game is scheduled to be held at the same venue this Friday. Yesterday afternoon, there was also an exhibition match between South China and Huaqiang starting at 5 PM. South China showed great determination and won against Huaqiang with sixty-eight points against fifty-five. South China also led in the first half with thirty-three points against twenty-eight. The results of yesterday's finals are as follows:</p>

<h3>Yiyou Table Tennis Semifinals</h3>
<p>Kong Hanchen Defeats the Ever-Victorious Army</p>
<p>Cheng Shuming Suspends Game Due to Sister's Death</p>
<p>The Yiyou Cup Individual Table Tennis Championship had three semifinals last night, starting at 8 PM at the club's ball room on Fuxu Lane, Tianjin Road. Shan Zhengchen served as the referee. In the first match, young Yang Changjia, from the ever-victorious army, defeated his elder brother Yang Changxi with a score of 3-2. Li Feixiang defeated Li Ranchun in the final match with a score of 3-2. Yang Changjia then faced Kong Hanchen again. Kong is a veteran in the silk and cloth industry and has a very stable stroke. Although the young Yang launched a desperate attack, he lost due to his small size and lack of strength. In the end, a dark horse emerged, and the ever-victorious army suffered a terrible defeat. Old Kong defeated the young player with a score of 3-2, which can be said to be no easy feat. The original schedule for tonight was Yang Changjia against Cheng Shuming, but Cheng's sister passed away due to illness yesterday morning, so tonight's match could not be held. The standing committee decided to suspend the match for a few days and then reschedule it. After the Cheng-Yang match is held, the championship will be scheduled. At that time, Mr. Chen Jimao, the former table tennis team leader of the club, will be invited to serve as the chief referee. The results of yesterday's matches are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Feixiang defeated Li Zaichun 3-2</p>

<h3>U.S. Earnestly Implements Lend-Lease Act, Sino-American Cooperation Strengthens, New York Organizes Emergency Council for Democracy, Convenes Conference to Promote Defense Strategies, Shanghai Observers Believe U.S.-Japan Negotiations Not Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>Since the U.S. and Japan engaged in exploratory negotiations, various parties have speculated about the consequences. A reporter from Xin Sheng asked well-informed observers in Shanghai. According to them, any speculation arising from the U.S.-Japan negotiations has no credible or noteworthy basis. China has been fighting for more than four years, becoming the Far Eastern fortress of the world's democratic camp, preventing other countries from being affected. Without China's strong perseverance for nearly four years, what would have happened to British and American interests in Southeast Asia after the outbreak of the European war, and what would have happened to Russia's eastern border? The United States is well aware of this fact and would never be willing to harm its own traditional rights and interests. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the U.S.-Japan negotiations, the United States will never sacrifice China, as evidenced by Foreign Minister Guo's remarks on the 15th.</p>
<p>China's Basic National Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The United States certainly does not intend to sacrifice China, and China will certainly not sacrifice the honorable position it has gained through four years of bloody battles, as well as its right to national construction. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has made a solemn statement on this matter: "I emphasize to our American friends that China will not change its policy of fighting to the end and will make the necessary sacrifices until the Far East and the world obtain permanent and fair peace." China's position in the Pacific is extremely important, and the United States has no reason to abandon this mainstay of the Far East. China's basic national policy has also not changed in any way.</p>
<p>U.S. Lend-Lease Act Earnestly Implemented</p>
<p>In fact, the U.S. policy of aiding China has not shown any signs of decline due to the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations. In his report to Congress on the Lend-Lease Act on the 15th, President Roosevelt stated that the main task of the Lend-Lease program is to aid China and the United Kingdom. The purpose of the program is also to improve, expand, and secure the sea routes for transporting essential goods to China, maintain domestic transportation in China, and enhance China's air force. President Roosevelt's presentation of a report on the aid to China program during the negotiations with Japan is tantamount to a serious warning. Sino-American cooperation is becoming stronger, and the strength of cooperation can make any actions aimed at achieving the opposite results a bubble. In short, China is still in a harmonious international environment, and its diplomacy and military will take the initiative, expecting to bear bright fruits and achieve its long-standing expectations.</p>
<p>Three Countries United in Defending Democracy</p>
<p>The Emergency Council for Democracy in the United States was founded by the famous American radio commentator, Mr. Grant Stern. Through Mr. Stern's efforts, it has gained the attention of all sectors of American politics, business, and academia. The purpose of the Council is purely to meet the needs of the times, to explain the fundamental and important issues of survival for democratic countries in the current era to the citizens of various democratic countries, and to enable the citizens of various democratic countries to recognize, participate in, and promote the urgent work of defending democratic politics. According to the Council's news, the Emergency Council for Democracy in New York is scheduled to hold a meeting at the Madison Square Garden at 7:30 PM on the 19th of this month. It is expected that more than tens of thousands of people will attend the meeting. The meeting will be chaired by Mr. Robert H. Jackson, a current judge of the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Charles Evans Hughes, the former Governor of New York, and dozens of other celebrities will deliver passionate speeches to encourage the public to defend democracy. In addition to American citizens, many British expatriates will participate. However, the Council believes that among the citizens of all countries who represent the spirit of democracy, China is the mainstay in addition to the nationals of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, this emergency meeting cannot be without Chinese participation. Therefore, the Council has contacted the Central Committee of the China Aid Association to ask them to consult with responsible groups in Chinatown to invite overseas Chinese to participate on their behalf, so as to win glory for the Chinese nation. The committee has now contacted the New York General Association and asked them to instruct the overseas Chinese in Chinatown to participate.</p>
<h3>Fuchs Has Reportedly Arrived in Shanghai; Hawkins Denies</h3>
<p>According to a Japanese news agency report from Hong Kong on the 15th, after the meeting of the Stabilization Fund Committee in Hong Kong, the Chinese members of the committee, Chen Guangfu and Bei Songsun, flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing on the 14th. The American member, Fuchs, originally planned to go to Chongqing but has changed his plans and arrived in Shanghai on the 12th aboard a ship with an assistant named Taylor. The British member, Hall Patch, and the Chinese member, Xi Demao, remained in Hong Kong to preside over everything. It is confirmed that a ship did arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong that day, the Zhesaria of the Java Company, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. However, there is no reliable information to confirm whether the two men arrived in Shanghai on that ship. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with Mr. Hawkins, the general manager of the Mercantile Bank, who stated, "This is not accurate. To the best of my knowledge, Fuchs was still in Hong Kong last week." Since the 12th was last Friday, and it is confirmed tonight that Fuchs did not leave Hong Kong last week, then the report of his arrival in Shanghai must be a false rumor.</p>
<h3>Italian Warships Sail to Southern Huangpu</h3>
<p>There are currently three Italian warships berthed in the Huangpu River. The No. 12 buoy outside the Waibaidu Bridge is the designated Italian naval buoy, where the Repanto-class shallow-water gunboat and the E. Carlotto-class light cruiser, which arrived in Shanghai from Kobe at the end of last month, are berthed. In addition, the Eritrea-class shallow-water gunboat is berthed at buoy No. 20/21. It is learned that the two light cruisers suddenly set sail from buoy No. 12 to Southern Huangpu the day before yesterday. It is unknown whether they are undergoing repairs. As for the shallow-water gunboat berthed at buoy No. 20/21, it was also moved to buoy No. 12 to berth alongside another shallow-water gunboat.</p>
<h3>Public Warehouse Foreign Exchange Fund Specially Approved for Unfreezing, Equivalent to 17 Million National Currency, Transferred to Central Bank for Original Currency Withdrawal</h3>
<p>After the United States froze Chinese funds, the government decided to reward the inward transfer of funds. All foreign exchange assets of domestic Chinese and foreign people could be unfrozen by the Central Bank. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the British foreign exchange fund used by the Public Warehouse Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council to purchase cheap rice, equivalent to 17 million National Currency, was originally deposited in Chinese commercial banks such as the Continental Bank. Due to the impact of the freezing order on the Chinese commercial banks, it has been specially approved to transfer the fund to the Central Bank for safekeeping and unfreezing. In the future, the Public Warehouse Committee will be able to deposit and withdraw the original currency from the Central Bank to facilitate the purchase of foreign rice. According to the Ministry of Finance's regulations on unfreezing foreign exchange assets, the Central Bank may purchase or deposit foreign currency drafts or bank deposit certificates at the price of 5 and 5/16 (i.e., 18 yuan and 81 cents legal tender per U.S. dollar) or 5 and 5/32 (i.e., 76 yuan and 08 cents legal tender per pound sterling) legal tender per foreign currency. After being exchanged for legal tender, withdrawals can be made. If the original currency still needs to be withdrawn, the approval of the Stabilization Fund Committee is required.</p>
<h3>After the Assassination of Two Russian Émigrés, All White Russians in Shanghai Are Shocked; Suleikinikov Replaces the Chairman of the White Russian Association; Assassin of Mamantov Arrested by French Police; the Two Assassination Cases Are Related</h3>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" reported that after the Chairman of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, Ivanov, was shot and killed on Moore Road yesterday (the 15th), a member of the committee, Suleikinikov, has been appointed to act as chairman. Mr. Suleikinikov is 55 years old and has been a member of the committee for 13 years. It is very likely that he will soon be elected as the new chairman.</p>
<p>Russian Expatriates Shocked, Undertake Prevention</p>
<p>At the same time, the authorities continued to investigate the assassination of Ivanov this morning (the 16th), but have not yet apprehended the perpetrator. It is generally believed that the case was politically motivated, but the police have remained silent on the matter. Reliable sources said that Ivanov's assassination is related to the assassination of Russian Mamantov on Sunday night.</p>
<p>It is said that after the occurrence of these two cases, the lives of several other Russians in this area are also in danger, and they are now taking preventive measures. The White Russians in Shanghai were shocked by the assassination of Ivanov. Last night, they flocked to the Henry Road Church to offer their condolences. The Russian side said that Ivanov was assassinated in similar circumstances to the former chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Committee, Metzlera. Ivanov's body may be buried in the Jing'an Temple Cemetery, but the date of burial has not been determined.</p>
<p>Mamantov Assassination Case Solved</p>
<p>Mamantov (Serge Mamantolf, previously reported as Malotov), a Russian who worked for the Russian-language Dadao Times published by the Japanese in Hongkou, was shot on Huanlong Road while riding in a rickshaw on the evening of the 14th of this month. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but eventually died at 4 PM on the 15th due to critical injuries. The French Concession Police Department conducted an investigation and quickly solved the case. The perpetrator is the bodyguard of a Chinese resident of Montauban Road.</p>
<p>Named Liu Fanglin</p>
<p>(transliteration), 38 years old. The French police immediately cooperated with the Public Concession police authorities to arrest the suspect Liu at the Chinese resident's home on Montauban Road. It is reported that Liu has confessed that he is the perpetrator who shot and assassinated Mamantov, and has also confessed to several other Chinese involved in the case. It is expected that these Chinese will also be arrested soon. However, details about these accomplices could not be ascertained. It is also reported that before his death, Mamantov named several people to the French police, claiming that they instigated the crime. Therefore, several suspects were arrested yesterday morning, including several Russians, all of whom were subsequently released except for a Russian actor and writer named Hevans, who remains in custody. Mamantov told the police that Hevans had threatened to kill him. The French Police Department questioned Hevans yesterday, but declined to disclose details.</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the September 18th Incident: Strict Alert by Military and Police</h3>
<p>Intensified Patrols and Defenses Initiated Yesterday</p>
<p>For the sake of maintaining order within their jurisdictions and ensuring the safety of residents, the police authorities of the two concessions began implementing security measures yesterday morning, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). In addition to prohibiting all illegal gatherings and activities, all detectives were divided into districts and shifts, dispatched to various roads to undertake duties such as guarding, patrolling, and inspection. Male and female inspection teams, patrol car teams, and red emergency vehicle reserve teams also took turns patrolling various districts of the concessions. The defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps assisted the police in areas where they were insufficient, and defensive arrangements along the borders were also strengthened early on. In the western district of the Public Concession, such as Yuyuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road, additional armed police officers were dispatched to guard posts near sandbag bunkers, selectively inspecting pedestrians and vehicles passing by. In the French Concession area, including Route Heger and Route Tenant de la Tour, in addition to the existing obstacles and armed detectives, patrol car teams took turns patrolling, and patrol teams composed of Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched daily to patrol the border roads or guard key transportation routes to prevent incidents. Furthermore, at 2 PM yesterday afternoon, during a busy time for pedestrian and vehicle traffic at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, someone dropped a large number of slogans from the rooftop, stirring excitement among the viewing public.</p>
<h3>President Monroe Sails South Yesterday Morning, Carrying Passengers, New French Mail Ship Arrives Tomorrow Morning, Carrying 14,000 Bags of Tribute Rice</h3>
<p>The President Monroe, a World Class mail ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the night before last and docked at Floating Pontoon Numbers Fourteen and Fifteen, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The mail ship left port yesterday morning, passing through various ports in Southeast Asia and returning to the United States according to its World Class route. It carried 24 passengers from the United States, and approximately 30 passengers who either transferred to go to Southeast Asia or were tourists. Only a little more than 20 people from Shanghai boarded the mail ship to go to Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it is stipulated that the President Adams will return to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong around the 27th of this month, returning to Los Angeles via Honolulu. The Linois, a French mail ship of the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes, will arrive directly in Shanghai from Saigon tomorrow morning, carrying 14,000 bags of tribute rice. This ship is a recent arrival to Shanghai. The Sindh, another ship of the company, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Yokohama, Japan, today.</p>
<h3>Bank Interest Rate Reductions, Collection of Bill Discount Fees, Elimination of Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>Commercial banks, in light of the easing of credit in the Shanghai market, have decided to reduce interest rates on fixed and current deposits. At the same time, a handling fee of one dime (10 cents) in national currency will be charged for each check used by current account holders, or one dime for each bill discount. However, those who discount bills will no longer be charged a check fee. As for the branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank in the rear areas, as well as the branches of various commercial banks, all will raise interest rates on various deposits, aiming to encourage the natural inward flow of excess capital in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Current Account Interest at Two Li</p>
<p>A notice from the Continental Bank and other banks states: "It has been decided that, starting from this period, the interest rate on current deposits, originally set at two li per week or higher, will be temporarily changed to two li per week. Interest will be calculated based on the lowest balance at the end of each month, with fractions less than one hundred yuan not counted. This is hereby notified for your attention."</p>
<p>Cancellation of Increased Interest Rate Method</p>
<p>Regulations for bill discounts and bill interest for the native banks have been established: (1) The maximum fee for local or foreign bill discounts is two jiao per thousand yuan; (3) The minimum bill interest is one jiao per thousand yuan. However, the regulations for banks do not include provisions for bill discounts and bill interest. Therefore, exchange shops have always collected bill discounts. Now, banks such as the Chekiang Industrial Bank are also collecting bill discount fees. Regarding deposit interest rates, each bank has revised its rates based on market conditions and the urgency of demand, in accordance with industry regulations. However, the banks and native banks are not completely uniform. Past preferential measures, such as adding a certain amount to the interest rate for daily or monthly balances exceeding a certain amount, have been completely canceled.</p>
<h3>China Central Telecommunications Company Bomb Explosion</h3>
<p>The former Shanghai International Radio Station, now known as the China Central Telecommunications Company, located in the Sassoon House on the Bund in Nanjing Road, is accessed through the Renji Road entrance. The transmitting and receiving equipment are installed in rooms 130 to 131 of the building. At around 11 PM last night, a large timed bomb suddenly exploded in those rooms, with thick smoke and flames spreading everywhere, and the sound shaking nearby areas. The explosive force was extremely strong, shattering the large glass windows of the Sassoon House, with fragments falling onto Renji Road. Upon hearing the alarm, the police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate, and the fire department also sent ambulances to the scene. After the black smoke dissipated, it was found that there was no fire, and only one worker was slightly injured. The detectives took the shrapnel to the police station for investigation. It is said that the adjacent Democratic Radio Station also suffered losses.</p>
<h3>Special Martial Law Suddenly Imposed at the North Railway Station Yesterday</h3>
<p>Starting at around 7 AM yesterday, special martial law was suddenly imposed at the North Railway Station in Zhabei. Passengers inside the station were completely evacuated into the concession, and even street vendors selling bread and other small items were driven away. Xinmin Road, from the Han Bridge eastward through Baoshan Road, Fusheng Road, to the intersection of North Jiangxi Road, and Bazilu Road, was closed to all pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Traffic was also cut off at both sides of Baoshan Road facing north toward Qujiang Road. Soldiers of the Japanese and Chinese armies stood guard everywhere, creating a very tense situation. This lasted for about two hours, and the martial law was lifted after 9 AM.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Announces New Entry Regulations for Wartime Needs: Strict Restrictions on Entering and Transiting Passengers, Certificate Application Procedures Divided into Five Categories</h3>
<p>To meet wartime needs, the Hong Kong government has announced new entry regulations to reduce population density, abolish the system of landing with guarantor guarantees, and strengthen inspections of ships entering Hong Kong. However, Chinese compatriots can enter Hong Kong with passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The China Travel Service has established close contact with the Immigration Department and continues to issue temporary entry permits. Passengers holding these permits will not be obstructed and can exchange them for official documents upon arrival in Hong Kong. The new entry regulations are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Passengers coming to Hong Kong for employment purposes must have their companies' deputy managers or responsible persons personally bring the company seal to the Immigration Department to sign an employment guarantee (Bond Employment), proving that the applicant is a member of their staff, hired from a certain location for a certain position with a certain monthly salary. The company will be absolutely responsible for sending the employee out of the country within ten days, regardless of whether the employee resigns or is dismissed. Otherwise, the department may prosecute based on the guarantee.</p>
<p>(2) Passengers coming to Hong Kong for visiting relatives and friends must have their relatives and friends provide a guarantee and sign a tourist guarantee (Bond Visiting). The department will grant a reasonable period, before the expiration of which the visitor must leave Hong Kong. Otherwise, the guarantor will bear all responsibility or be fined.</p>
<p>(3) Passengers coming to Hong Kong to transfer to another location must also have a Hong Kong shop provide a guarantee, stating the date of departure from Hong Kong. At that time, the guarantor must bring the passenger's ticket to the department to cancel it, in order to fulfill their responsibility.</p>
<p>(4) The Immigration Department treats temporary entry permits issued by travel agencies very favorably. The restrictions are not as strict as those mentioned above. Transit passengers are exempt from providing a shop guarantee and are given a special permit to pass through Hong Kong. Those visiting relatives are also exempt from providing a guarantee and are given a special permit with a limited period of stay. However, the regulations are still very strict for those coming to Hong Kong for employment. If a guarantee from an employer is not obtained, the permit will be refused. Therefore, the address on the application form must be written in detail.</p>
<p>(5) A special permit (Entry Permit Special Terms) is an entry permit with a short validity period, specifying the purpose of coming to Hong Kong, the place of origin, the date of departure from Hong Kong, the validity period, and the number of valid entries. In summary, it is impossible to predict what type of permit the department will issue. Sometimes, applications for a two-year permit will result in the issuance of a six-month permit or a special permit. Applications for a six-month permit may only result in a special permit that can be used once. The authority for approval rests with the department.</p>

<h3>Record of Cracking Down on the Terrorist Gang Specializing in Extorting Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>The leader has a rice store on Route Paul Henry, and the extortion of the Lafayette Theater provided the clue.</p>
<p>Since movie theaters such as the Jin Cheng and Jin Du in the Public Concession, and the Hu Guang and Lafayette in the French Concession, were successively attacked by thugs throwing smoke bombs and extorting insurance fees, the police authorities, considering these actions as disrupting public order and endangering commerce, immediately ordered their subordinates to arrest the perpetrators to uphold the law. After the Lafayette Theater was bombed by these thugs on the evening of the 5th of this month, it also</p>
<p>Received an Extortion Letter</p>
<p>Demanding an insurance fee of 1,000 yuan, instructing the theater to bring the money to the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier and Route Keyna in western Shanghai the next day for negotiations. The theater reported this to the police, and the French police sent plainclothes detectives along with special police to arrest the gang's small leader, a Korean named He Bin (32 years old), nicknamed "Little Korea," at that location. He was taken to the police station for investigation. Subsequently, through the efforts of Chinese Detective Yue Sixiang, Detectives Chen Jigen and Jing Hexiang of the Criminal Division of the police station, it was discovered that the gang was hiding in the Public Concession, in the</p>
<p>East Asia Hotel</p>
<p>Room 424, where the thugs Shen Rengxi (from Pudong, 24 years old), Ma Xuewen (45 years old) were arrested. Subsequently, based on their confessions, Huang Xiangsheng (18 years old) and Hu Chengjian (24 years old), and Cai Jinyuan (35 years old), all from Pudong, were apprehended at 530 Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. Following that, Xie Yuting (45 years old), a local resident, was arrested at No. 19, Lane 362 on Route Petain. Many threatening documents and wooden stamps with iron-blue gang emblems were seized in the room, and they were all</p>
<p>Brought Back to the Police Station</p>
<p>At the same time, guards were stationed in various places, and more than ten other suspects were subsequently apprehended, totaling twenty-two individuals. They were all investigated together. After investigation, it was learned that except for the above seven, the others were all unrelated and were released. During the investigation, the police station, because it still had to strictly arrest the gang leader, Chen Wangwu (formerly the captain of the police detachment in Nanhui) from Nanhui, and the deputy leader, Shi Qinqing (Little Korea is Chen's disciple), did not release information about the case. Now that</p>
<p>Chen and Shi</p>
<p>Have fled upon hearing the news, the case is being announced. It is also learned that Chen originally opened a rice store, the Xin Chang Rice Store, at Nos. 77 and 79 on Route Paul Henry. Knowing that the news was urgent, Chen moved the entire store overnight, and his whereabouts are unknown. When the police went to search, the place was empty. Only a dozen small glass bottles filled with phosphorus were found on the second floor and were taken back to the police station for inspection.</p>
<h3>Southeast Hospital Searched by Japanese</h3>
<p>Rumor has it that the hospital has been taking in wounded soldiers and is suspected of storing munitions inside.</p>
<p>Around 9 PM the night before last, the Japanese, along with French police personnel, went to the Southeast Hospital at the intersection of Route Saussure and Route du Père Huc to search it. The search yielded no results. It is reported that the reason the Japanese searched the hospital was because it was rumored that the hospital had taken in wounded soldiers during the August 13th Shanghai Battle, so it was suspected that it might have munitions stored inside. However, no contraband was found.</p>
<p>Moving Cars Also Increase in Price</p>
<p>After various car rental companies increased their prices, other smaller car rental companies also increased their prices yesterday. Due to rising oil prices and increased costs, moving car rental companies have also been unable to sustain their original car rental rates. Therefore, they have all announced that they will implement price increases starting yesterday. The rate for a moving car is now 20 yuan per hour, and the rate for a group bus is 25 yuan per hour. In reality, there is no shortage of gasoline in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read in your newspaper that yesterday morning, the Japanese, accompanied by police, arrested a Chinese person at No. 16 Ruifuli, Dongzilaihuo Street. It was reported that the Chinese person was out, and the arrest was unsuccessful. This is not in accordance with the facts. My family has lived here for over 30 years, and all the residents are legitimate businessmen. The occurrence of this matter must be a mistake. I am afraid of misunderstandings from all sectors, so I am writing a special letter to correct this. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, Wu Tangfu, 30.9.16.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, According to Venerable Degu, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, it has been brought to his attention that the Shanghai local news article "Internal Disputes Between Two Major Ancient Temples, Jing'an and Longhua, Heard" published in the 16th of this month's Shen Bao contains the following concerning this temple: "Degu insists that the temple is a family lineage, which can be passed down from master to disciple, disregarding previous government laws and decrees. Yangxi claims that the temple is a 'ten directions' system, which should be presided over by elders from various mountains, Dharma-protecting laymen, and elected abbots." This is alarming. In the past, this temple has been involved in lengthy litigation concerning the shaving of heads and the "ten directions" sectarian dispute. Finally, the Shanghai Provisional Court of the former Shanghai Public Concession (now the Shanghai First Special District District Court) ruled that this temple was a shaving-head sect temple and that the disputed abbotship should be succeeded by the late Master Zhiwen (Case No. 324 of the Sixteenth Year General Docket). The dispute was settled, and peace has reigned since. Even in the conciliation contract established between Yangxi and the late Master in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the first clause stated that "Jing'an Temple is a shaving-head sect temple." The original copy has Yangxi's personal signature and can be reviewed. Therefore, whether this temple is a shaving-head sect or a "ten directions" sect is indisputable. It is laughable that Yangxi suddenly claims that this temple is "ten directions," which is self-contradictory. As for the directives of the Ministry of Interior and the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Government cited by him, it remains questionable whether they are authentic. Even assuming they are, judicial independence is a major principle of the rule of law. A court's final judgment is not subject to or affected by the approval or orders of administrative authorities. Anyone with legal knowledge knows this. After the late Master's passing, Degu naturally succeeded as abbot. The court is a part of the Chinese government, and the effect of its final judgment extends not only to this temple. This temple complies with the legal judgment of the legal court. How can it be called "disregarding previous government laws and decrees"? Furthermore, although Yangxi once served as the temple's supervisor (in an advisory capacity) in the 18th year of the Republic of China, when Yangxi and the late Master litigated last year, the court determined that Yangxi's supervisory status no longer existed and violated the regulations on supervising temples. (Case No. 259 of the Litigation Docket of the First Special District District Court of the 29th year, Case No. 205 of the High Court Second Branch of the 29th year, Case No. 51 of the Shanghai Anti-Appeal Docket of the Supreme Court Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the 29th year). This shows that Yangxi is no longer the temple's supervisor and has no right to speak on matters concerning the temple. It should be stated that this temple is a shaving-head sect temple, while Yangxi is a "ten directions" monastic forest sect. Since the sects are different, there is no room for him to interfere in any affairs of this temple. In addition to this temple's advertisement, which also contains a detailed explanation in the Shen Bao, and since Yangxi's arbitrary defamation of the late Master has a special clause in the criminal law for punishing such actions, we will separately plan to handle it in accordance with the law. Therefore, we have specially entrusted your lawyer to send a letter to the Shen Bao, requesting a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhou Xiao'an, September 16.</p>
<h3>The Salvation Army's Work of Sheltering Beggars Becomes Increasingly Difficult: Many Beggars Are Unwilling to Give Up Their Original Lives, and Beggar Children Are Even More Rebellious and Difficult to Manage</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Salvation Army in Shanghai is currently sheltering street beggars and teaching them ways to make a living and become self-reliant. This task is quite challenging. According to Major Walker, head of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, the Salvation Army cannot eliminate street beggars, just as hospitals cannot cure all the diseases of Shanghai. The Salvation Army can only promise to treat beggars</p>
<p>Individually</p>
<p>with the utmost sincerity. Since handling beggars, the Salvation Army has cared for more than 2,800 beggars. The Salvation Army's beggar shelters are not "clearing houses." Depending on the circumstances, in cooperation with the police, villagers who have strayed into Shanghai are sent back to their hometowns. Young and strong beggars are allowed to find guarantors and leave the shelter to find their own livelihoods. Beggar children are kept in the shelter and taught education and crafts such as clothing making and shoe making. Female beggars in the shelter embroider gloves and wash clothes. A small number of stronger male beggars work on breaking stones and can earn 15 yuan per month, which is given to them when they leave the shelter. The difference between refugee and beggar relief</p>
<p>is that refugees are willing, while beggars are often unwilling to give up their begging lives. Therefore, they resist entering the shelter as if they were being arrested and imprisoned. Moreover, many beggars are drug addicts and do not have access to drugs after entering the shelter. Many beggars are also petty thieves, especially beggar children. Of the 250 beggars in the shelter, a small number specialize in stealing cotton, rice, and other items from trucks. They would rather endure the beatings of the guards than steal a small amount of cotton and rice and escape. The beggars also suffer from disease,</p>
<p>blindness, and disability. Blind beggars are a serious problem. They have little hope of being taught a livelihood skill or becoming self-reliant. Without the ability to work, they have no other desire than to beg. These unfortunate beggars are currently kept in the shelter and are not allowed to go out, but there is hope that a solution will be found soon. Many disabled and weak beggars are also unwilling to stay in the shelter. Another serious problem encountered by the Salvation Army is homeless, wandering beggar children. Although their crimes are small, they are large in scale. When admitted to the shelter, they are not afraid at all and even disobey instructions. There have been</p>
<p>groups of beggar children</p>
<p>who smashed the windows of the shelter and were extremely stubborn. The police had to be called to restrain them. On another occasion, the beggar children refused to attend classes. The shelter then took resolute measures and withheld food, and the beggar children were willing to attend school. After patient persuasion, their bad habits were greatly changed. In the vocational school of the shelter, beggar children have already made 500 pairs of shoes and 1,000 pieces of clothing, and recently they have also been making bamboo products. As for those who come to Shanghai from the countryside and beg, the police are certainly unable to identify them, and there is no way to know the past history of the beggars. However, after being sent to the shelter, the shelter strictly questions their backgrounds. Those who are</p>
<p>villagers begging mostly say that the situation in the countryside is unfavorable, forcing them to come to Shanghai to make a living. Whenever the Salvation Army encounters this kind of beggar, it takes a photo of them, obtains a pass, and sends them to the station or ship, giving them a ticket and one yuan in cash to return to their hometowns. More than 400 people have been sent back. According to the police investigation, no beggar has been found to be begging here again after being sent back, and some have even written letters to the Salvation Army from their hometowns to express their gratitude. Major Walker, who succeeded Brigadier-General Murray as head of the Salvation Army in the Shanghai area, has worked in charity in North China and has a lot of experience in refugee and beggar relief work.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial News: Large Amounts of US Dollars Coming, Moving Them Inside Dong Guan Gate and Locking the West is Not Easy. Don't Forget the Past Lesson of British Bank Notes, Don't Worry About Empty Dumplings.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable trends in British and American gold pounds and British remainder notes. US dollar notes rose sharply, once reaching as high as 22 yuan, and finally closing at 21.95 yuan, a gain of 4.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Since the freezing of US remittances, there have been rumors in the market that large amounts of US dollar notes will be transported to Shanghai. This is based on the general speculative psychology that although US remittances can be frozen, US dollar notes are cash and can be used to buy and sell American goods as a substitute for large amounts of US remittances. However, it is not known where these large amounts of US remittances come from. Some say they are being moved from Hong Kong, but it is not known whether Hong Kong will allow them to be transferred. Under the current situation of moving them inside Dong Guan Gate and locking the west, transporting paper money is not an easy task. Even if they can be transported, it should be known that a country's banknotes are not a circulating currency in a foreign country. The example of British pound notes is a lesson to be learned. Moreover, it is not known whether American merchant banks will continue to accept US dollar notes as usual. Some people are still thinking of hoarding US dollar notes, and the opposite side is taking the opportunity to promote them and profit from them. Regardless of whether it is true or false, they will first use an empty dumpling to whet people's appetites and then see the situation before preparing, so that the US dollar note trade can be temporarily grand and prosperous. This is a good business strategy. In addition, Hong Kong notes showed a stable trend, and the market price was stable. Japanese gold notes showed a downward trend, falling to 2.31 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes showed a firm trend, rising to 1.91 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Another Theory About Black Market Exchange: Imported Goods That Are Not Necessities Will Be Paid For in US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable central and HSBC exchange rates. There were still few applicants for HSBC's small counter price. The black market for British and American currencies reported calm again. Import foreign companies that are not allowed to apply for non-essential goods are still secretly active, but it is difficult to find opponents. There were no transactions heard of all day. The market price of British exchange was 2 shillings, 8.4375 pence flat, and the price of US dollars was 4.825, long 0.0625. Speculative bulls and bears who have not settled this month are still waiting for a solution to settle. It is said that for imported goods with orders that are not necessities, the amount of goods can be paid in US dollar notes converted to Taiwan-US exchange. According to reliable sources, a British merchant bank in this city will soon transport 3 million US dollars to the United States, and a German merchant bank advanced 100,000 US dollar notes yesterday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened dull this morning, and all currencies showed no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 16th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfer tight 0.0625, for 3 pence 0.0625. New York telegraphic transfer and Shanghai exchange were unchanged. Lian banknotes opened at 1.23 yuan, for 49.62 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market: Only Adorned by Spot Goods, Prices Rise by 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's melted red black market turned to rising, because the temporary compromise between the United States and Japan has nothing to do with the Far East. The hearts of all parties have strengthened again. There were less than 200 taels of futures traded. The price rose from 6,858 yuan to 6,872 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Cash turned to rising again, because the price after closing last night had already been raised. Therefore, Zhongxing sold 10 taels to Chida, and the price rose to 8,900 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan. Russia then sold 20 taels to Defu for 8,890 yuan, 30 taels for 8,910 yuan. Defu then advanced Fukang and Yong 10 taels. Zhongxing advanced 30 taels, 8,920 yuan. Yongcheng advanced Chengji and Yifeng 50 taels each for 8,950 yuan. Yiyuan advanced Yifeng 20 taels, 8,950 yuan, 50 taels 8,935 yuan, and another 50 taels 8,930 yuan. Then Lianxing advanced 10 taels, 8,950 yuan. Yongcheng advanced Xianghe 60 taels, Yifeng 50 taels, 8,955 yuan. At noon, Xianghe advanced Yifeng 30 taels, Litai 20 taels, and Hesheng 10 taels. The noon close was 8,940 yuan. In the afternoon, Xianghe advanced Tongkangyong 20 taels, and Chengji, Wanfeng, Hongqing, and Yong 10 taels each for 8,950 yuan. Hesheng advanced a certain money house 10 taels for 8,970 yuan. Xianghe then advanced Shihe 20 taels, and Tianyuan Yifeng 10 taels each. Later, Tianyuan re-advanced Chen Da 10 taels and Yongfeng 20 taels, all at 8,950 yuan, an increase of 110 yuan, 80 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 600 taels were traded. The storefront price of gold numbers was 9,000 yuan, with a buy-in price 200 yuan lower than the sale price. The ornament order increased by 10 yuan, to 920 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Trading Completed</p>
<p>The opening price of October gold per bar (10 taels) at 9:15 was Yifeng buying in at a high of 3 yuan, totaling 6,858 yuan. Chida received it, and then Tianyuan advanced it again. It rose slightly at noon. The noon close was 6,872 yuan. There were few transactions in the afternoon. From the opening to the evening close, it was 6,870 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan from the previous day's closing price, with a high of 14 yuan for the whole day.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Hung Up 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The sale price of jewelry gold per tael in silver buildings rose by 10 yuan at 10 a.m., to 920 yuan, with the buy-in price reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Market Update: Domestic Debt Market's Long Rally Pauses, Foreign Stock Markets Rife with Rumors</h3>
<p>Yesterday's public debt dark market saw a halt to the rising trend. Although both Xinfu and Tongkang continued to buy, the market lacked unified sentiment. Selling orders exceeded buying orders, causing a straight-line decline in market conditions. Type C bonds nearly broke the two-yuan mark, showing a weakening trend, making it difficult to see improvement in the short term. Signs of wavering market sentiment were evident. It remains to be seen whether the two-yuan level for Type C bonds can be maintained.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Xinhua, Xinfu, and Tongkang consistently bought, while sellers included Jiucheng, Lianyi, Renfeng, Xie Kang, Ding Kang, Shuntai, and others. Type C bonds opened at two yuan and seven jiao, briefly saw a small price of two jiao and a half, and although the midday close was at three jiao and a half, it was a weak recovery. At the midday close, Xinfu and Tongkang still had residual buying power, and Lianhe, Runli, Delong, Le Mao, Yiji, and others also had demand. Ding Kang continued to sell, while Yitai and Shengda heavily sold off, attracting attention. Tongshen San Kai, Xiexing Yuan, and others were also eager to sell. Type C bonds fell as low as two yuan, closing at only two yuan and one jiao. The trend is weakening, and further declines are feared. Market prices uniformly fell by three to six jiao. Transactions totaled two hundred and thirty to forty yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Transactions included Great China Fire Insurance Company shares, one hundred shares, at a price of forty-six yuan and seven jiao and a half.</p>
<p>The general stock market opened strong but soon softened. There were many twists and turns mid-session, and the final result was slightly lower than the previous close. Market sentiment remains positive. However, because various stocks had experienced several days of sharp gains, prices seemed quite high. Consequently, any rumors could trigger a sudden shift in sentiment. The future remains uncertain, depending on the overall situation.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed only bank stocks gaining. The new price of Mercantile Bank shares, after dividend deduction, was £9 10s. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered shares rose half a pound to £77 10s. Hong Kong-registered shares rose six pounds to £85. There were offers but no buyers. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn &amp; Cloth: Peace Rumors Turn into Smoke Screen, Bulls Anxious to Buy, Ignoring Weak Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's heavily declined yarn and cloth market recovered in the afternoon. This was due to rumors in the market that the U.S.-Japan agreement was again elusive. This improved the sentiment of speculators. The wind shifted slightly, with covering and renewed buying occurring simultaneously. However, actual transactions did not show significant progress. A Hong Kong group bought 150 bales of coarse yarn. No other transactions were reported. Prices for 32-count and 42-count yarns continued to decline. The situation for Japanese yarn is weakening. Therefore, given the current situation, the market is expected to fluctuate. A significant uptrend is unlikely.</p>
<p>The high price for Double Horse 20-count yarn was 1,732 yuan, the low price was 1,715 yuan. The afternoon opened roughly flat at 1,732 yuan. The price gradually rose with the exchange price, climbing to 1,744 yuan. The closing price was 1,740 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened this morning, continuing the upward trend from the previous day's close. The opening price was 1,715 yuan. As soon as the price opened, covering rushed in, immediately pushing the price to 1,723 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange opened higher, boosting market sentiment and driving the price to 1,732 yuan. However, sales were sluggish, fluctuating around 1,728-29 yuan. The closing price was 1,728 yuan. Total transactions for half a day were estimated at 8,130 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 130 bales</p>
<p>Counterparts: 8,000 bales</p>
<p>Total: 8,130 bales</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market experienced a sharp rise after a fall amidst confusing news. The rebound was particularly strong. The total fluctuation for the day reached 11 to 18 yuan. The morning opening was initially weak due to further declines in U.S. cotton prices. Mill orders fell first, and sentiment for yarn futures declined accordingly. Short positions and long positions both heavily sold. Later, as the exchange gradually strengthened, selling pressure decreased. Mill orders rebounded in a straight line, and yarn futures rose sharply. Large investors who had been observing quietly saw the rapid decline in recent days and considered the price quite low. Therefore, as soon as an upward trend appeared, they competed to buy. Moreover, the peace rumors that the market had feared for days, lacking strong confirmation, inevitably caused the basis for short positions to waver. Long positions, aware of the fundamental scarcity of cotton and the firmness of prices, rushed to cover and increase their positions. New long positions were particularly active in buying. Therefore, the market price was initially weak but later firm. If further confusing news emerges, the potential for selling may temporarily weaken. The ground has already stabilized.</p>
<p>The opening price for September futures was 1,650 yuan, for October futures 1,659 yuan, and for November futures 1,677 yuan. The afternoon saw a recovery, and the results were: September futures closed at 1,657 yuan, up 4.5 yuan; October futures at 1,673 yuan, up 3.5 yuan; and November futures at 1,682 yuan, a significant increase of 15 yuan. A table is provided below:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Improves, Cotton Market Active</h3>
<p>The raw cotton market was initially very mediocre. In the afternoon, the yarn market recovered, bringing a positive atmosphere. Trading also suddenly became active. The rumors of Pacific peace talks remain uncertain. Shanghai's inventory is not high. New domestic cotton has been damaged by recent wind and rain, and the output is not expected to be abundant. Yesterday's yarn and cloth prices improved, and mills gradually became more receptive, influencing market sentiment and transforming doubt into certainty. The business situation suddenly became enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market declined slightly due to aggressive selling by Southern groups, a lack of significant buyers, and a better-than-expected weather report. Yesterday's opening price was down 18-19 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to spot traders selling, then rebounded due to short covering. However, the market ultimately fell again due to cotton merchant selling and long liquidation. The closing price was down 6-7 rupees across the board. The opening today is expected to continue declining by about one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was dull, with few transactions. This is likely due to unresolved foreign exchange settlement issues and the difficulty of obtaining shipping tonnage for cotton imports. Currently, there is little development.</p>
<h3>Grains: Small Parboiled Rice Nearing 100 Yuan, Further Declines of Three to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market opened in the morning carrying the weak momentum from the previous evening. Both futures and spot rice were uniformly weak and listless. Actual sales were cautious, and hoarders were nervous. Those holding inventory were eager to sell at market prices to settle early. The market was filled with calls to sell, while buyers were few. The market was difficult to improve. As rumors of a U.S.-Japan compromise became more prevalent in the market, long positions competed to liquidate. Major players were quietly selling heavily, and the market fell further. Although there were genuine buyers taking advantage of low prices, the market price was ultimately unable to recover. Broken rice fell to 76.5 yuan. Small parboiled rice from banks and warehouses fell to 100 yuan. General cargo from foreign warehouses fell into the 100-yuan range, opening at 98 yuan. Java red rice from inland groups also declined, opening at 97 yuan. Java white rice from Tianjin fell from 118 yuan to 116 yuan. British-Chinese Company's small-grained rice opened at 129.5 yuan. Spot broken rice was only 88.5 yuan, a decline of 3-5 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Although there was demand from genuine buyers and hoarders taking advantage of the low prices in the afternoon, the market price rose and fell again, unable to stabilize. The entire day's trading volume was 8-9,000 bags of spot rice and over 200 tons from the British-Chinese Company. Today, 1,400 bags of foreign rice are being shipped to Tianjin on the Taikoo's New Beijing vessel.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica domestic rice, facing the sharp decline in foreign rice prices, was also significantly affected, causing stalls in local stores to become stagnant and stale. Although goods were scarce, it was difficult for holders to maintain prices, and they fell by 2-3 yuan across the board. South Port early rice sold for 148 yuan, then 145 yuan. Thick japonica rice did not open. New Pudong japonica rice was 151.5 yuan, then 151 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was also in freefall, unable to stabilize, declining by around 2 yuan across the board. Hong Kong special glutinous rice opened at 126 yuan, ordinary glutinous rice at 123-120 yuan, and glutinous tea rice at 110 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Newly Arrived Local Products Open Lower</h3>
<p>Newly arrived local products in Hong Kong have recently arrived and were opened yesterday, priced at 444 yuan, which is relatively cheap.</p>
<p>After falling back, dried scallops opened yesterday at 1,205 yuan. Based on the asking price, this is a decrease of 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Manipulation Severely Profitable, Continuous Arrivals: Market Prices Soaring</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw renewed buying interest due to difficulties in foreign exchange settlement, pushing prices upward. The guild's clearing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar for September entry was 131 yuan, 32 yuan, 34.6 jiao, up 4.6 jiao. For August, it was 130 yuan, 31.8 jiao, 34 yuan, up 4.5 jiao. For July, it was 131.4 jiao, 33.6 jiao, up 4.1 jiao. Old cargo for March was 130 yuan, February was 128.5 yuan. Hong Kong cargo rose from 122 yuan to 25 yuan. Dutch red opened at 123 yuan, then 24 yuan in the afternoon, up 1 yuan. Taikoo vehicle white B mark was 162 yuan, up 2 yuan. HHX mark was 142 yuan, also up 2 yuan. Company futures for 24 coarse white sugar for September 20th was 128.4 jiao, 30.5 jiao, 31 yuan, 32.3 jiao, 33 yuan, up 3.9 jiao. For the 30th, it was 131.2 jiao, 32.7 jiao, 33.1 jiao, 32.5 jiao, up 1.8 jiao. Total transactions for futures and spot goods were over 50,000 bags.</p>
<p>A large quantity of Dutch sugar arrived in Shanghai. The Java Mail Steamship Company's Zesaruya arrived at noon yesterday. The entire ship was loaded with sugar, totaling 7,000 tons or over 70,000 bags. It docked at the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. Today, 6,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Tianjin on the Taikoo's New Beijing vessel.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Japanese Cotton Cloth Selling Well in Southeast Asia, Rising Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market saw a strong rebound yesterday. In the morning, the market hovered and rose slightly. Demand from Hong Kong increased. Factory sources were very tight. Dyeing factories and speculators showed strong buying interest. The market rebounded. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth rose 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth and velvet rose 0.5 to 1 yuan. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth factory quoted futures prices 1.5 to over 3 yuan higher than current spot prices per piece. Over 1,000 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers bought over 500 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Southeast Asian brokers bought over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse and fine cloth from factories such as Lun Chang and Jardine Matheson.</p>
<p>The rising trend for Dong cloth has reignited, with futures showing particular strength. Actual sales of mid- to low-grade fine cloth and twill cloth continue to be strong on this street. Selling prices are stable. The goods shipped from Shanghai to the southern islands. The exchange's futures cloth grades are still about 2 yuan lower per piece. Therefore, those shorting the market are cautious and eager to cover. Prices for all months have been pushed up, rebounding by about 0.8-0.9 yuan per piece. The leading fine cloth new orders in the spot market are still selling for 58.3 yuan. Si Jun Zi serge was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with new orders closing at 1.25 yuan, up 0.0275 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>On the 17th, 200 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and another 4 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>

<h3>Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>What dims the soul is parting. In terms of human sentiment, one day feels like three autumns, let alone ten years. I think all those experiencing separation share this feeling.</p>
<p>Remembrance, encouragement, and expectation arise from the bottom of one's heart when fathers and sons, brothers, and friends bid farewell, especially for those who have been separated for a long time, this feeling is even more profound.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, the past feels like yesterday, and ten years is but a fleeting moment. The short ten years since the founding of China is only one five-hundredth of its history. Looking at the lessons that history provides, the Chinese nation has a long-standing culture and a glorious history. Any difficulties or hardships are factors that encourage us to move forward, to develop and flourish. Therefore, these ten years of hardship are the inevitable experiences in creating a bright future.</p>
<p>Ten years, precious ten years, joyful, delightful, inspiring, and moving ten years. As the saying goes, "Ten years of accumulation, ten years of instruction." Since its history, the Chinese nation has endured hardship, hoping that ten years will be the foundation for revitalization. Looking at the past and comparing it to the present, the more difficult history is, the more brilliant it becomes!</p>
<h3>Many Blessings, Many Years, Many Sons: I am the Father of Seven Children</h3>
<p>— Gen Fa</p>
<p>"You are now going out into society! In the future, two will become three, and three will become four. The burden will become heavier and heavier. You must work harder, be thrifty, persevere, and endure hardship. Being a person is not easy!" This was the instruction my old father gave us fifteen years ago when we left our hometown to come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fifteen years have passed! As expected: endlessly, every two years, another one. Now, two has become nine!</p>
<p>Leading this group, moving south and north, going east and falling west. When renting houses, nine out of ten families dislike having too many children and refuse to rent to us. Buying clothes means buying seven pieces at a time. In the mornings, we struggle to find food, buying seven or eight large pancakes, with each person only getting one. Visiting relatives, walking on the streets, it's a continuous line, a group of people, resembling a picture of refugees. Now, we have finally found a garage, the whole family crammed inside like sardines. The ladies in the giant buildings across the street, hearing the children crying, have come down several times to reprimand us, threatening to drive out this family of noisy children with too many people.</p>
<p>This group of little refugees has no enjoyment, no entertainment, no security. People have three wives and four concubines, surrounded by attendants. We are cramped in the alleys, with no branch to perch on. People have medical care, diagnoses, milk, and supplements. We eat thin porridge and endure illness. People have schools and opportunities, considering studying a hardship and education a dreaded path. We pass by schools every day, unable to enter. It seems that besides maintaining these few small lives, there is no other future, no other hope in the world. However, there is always hope, I believe. The great men who shook the world in history mostly grew up in humble, difficult, and thorny environments. Therefore, we comfort ourselves and are unwilling to underestimate ourselves. Among the seven children, there will always be one who succeeds. We try our best to save some money, planning to cultivate the most hardworking, most studious, and most progressive one. We place all our hopes for the future on him. Amidst the present worries and hardships, we are nurturing future comfort and happiness.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Mr. Gen Fa, please allow me to express great sympathy for the difficulties you face in bringing "this group of little refugees." It is truly not easy during these times. But I admire your optimism even more. Only with optimism can you fight and cope with ease. Although your children suffer, they have an equal opportunity to succeed, so they will equally amount to something. However, please educate them universally, encouraging them to "do their best." If there's porridge, everyone eats porridge; if there's rice, everyone eats rice. Singling out one and placing all your hopes on him is the stance of a "speculator." You have a father's obligations. We hope no one will say you are unfair, wouldn't you agree?</p>
<h3>Skilled at "Rejecting Trouble"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ting</p>
<p>It is said that a nation "skilled at rejecting trouble" is an excellent nation, and its life will be infinite.</p>
<p>If everyone in the world could reject trouble, wouldn't the world be at peace? I once thought this, but I cannot guarantee that everyone among the 1.6 billion people in the world is willing to reject trouble. As long as a small minority of people are not afraid of "trouble," the world will immediately become unsettled. Look, the world only had one Hitler who was not afraid of trouble, and even Americans across the ocean had to busy themselves because of him. Although everyone seeks peace and dislikes trouble, how can one reject trouble while living in today's world?</p>
<p>However, human nature seems to dislike trouble, but the world's current state, the progress of humanity, and the development of culture are also the results of people not being afraid of trouble. All inventions, all creations, are troublesome, not just ordinary trouble, but extremely troublesome. I have not heard of any scientist who is afraid of trouble, and I have never heard of any scholar or successful person who is afraid of trouble.</p>
<p>Humanity's progress is due to not being afraid of trouble, and the development of culture is also due to humanity's not being afraid of trouble.</p>
<p>In modern society, one cannot be afraid of trouble; to survive in the modern world, one cannot be afraid of trouble.</p>
<p>If you reject trouble and dislike trouble, it means that you are worthless and unprogressive.</p>
<h3>Certainty</h3>
<p>— Bai Mo</p>
<p>I go to the head cinema every day, and people think I have money? But to be blunt, the reason I go is not to watch movies, but to pretend to look at the preview photos, enjoy some free entertainment, and use it as a place to escape from烦恼.</p>
<p>Swimming pools and skating rinks without women, massage parlors, game arcades, and grand hotels without female attendants will never be prosperous.</p>
<p>However, if a dance hall bans men, that dance hall will soon be declared closed.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Characters in the Civet Cat Case</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>2.  Empress Liu</p>
<p>Generally, women with outstanding talent and beauty are both sweet and sour, fragrant and spicy, capable of making heroes fall into their trap, playing them in the palm of their hand, and succumbing to their charm. However, Empress Liu is still a typical figure, not comparable to the licentious, cruel, ungrateful, and unjust Wu Zetian. When she was in power, the small official Fang Zhonggong submitted a memorial requesting the establishment of a Liu clan temple based on Wu Zetian's story, and Cheng Lin also presented a picture of Wu Zetian attending court. The empress threw his book on the ground and said: I will not do this to betray my ancestors. It can be seen that Empress Liu's expulsion was nothing more than being seduced by sensual pleasures. The fact that many sons born in the harem did not survive cannot be attributed to Empress Liu alone, as Empress Liu was still among the concubines in her early years. Later, there was a child raised outside, greatly implying that only a son of Empress Liu could become the heir to Emperor Zhenzong; this was Empress Liu's fault. Emperor Zhenzong loved and feared Empress Liu, complying with her wishes in every way, which is undeniable. However, Emperor Renzong was able to enjoy the glory of the emperor peacefully for forty-one years, thanks to the nurturing and protection of Empress Liu, which would have been difficult to obtain otherwise.</p>
<p>Empress Liu's shortcoming was her inability to bear children. Beauty without offspring, as described in the Odes, Empress Liu must have shared the same sentiment! Therefore, what she deeply desired in her heart was to have a son to secure her power and exclusive favor. Emperor Renzong was born seven years after the death of Crown Prince Daoxian. During this period, Empress Liu must have still hoped to have children herself. Later, realizing that she would never be able to do so, she thought of having Consort Li serve Emperor Zhenzong; Empress Liu was already forty-two years old when Emperor Renzong was born. Otherwise, with Empress Liu's refusal to allow others to share her husband's affections, how could she tolerate someone else sleeping next to her bed. Under the patriarchal system, the illegitimate son considers the primary wife as his mother, especially in the royal family. Therefore, Empress Liu actually tolerated Consort Li's favor, hoping that she would have a son, still with the intention of keeping power within her grasp.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12. Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>"Ah! Second Brother, is that you?... You are... when did you arrive?" One afternoon, he accidentally woke up from a drowsy state and suddenly felt as if there was someone else in the room. He tried his best to open his tired eyes to look around; one glance made him immediately excited, as the person pacing back and forth in front of his bed was none other than Zhao Yukun, his only old friend for the past twenty or thirty years.</p>
<p>Yukon was still very thin, as small as a monkey, and his clothes were as old and worn as usual, but his expression was not as cheerful as usual; hearing Begonia greet him, he did not say anything funny, only nodded slightly.</p>
<p>"Little Dog's brother just told me everything about your family!" He continued to walk around the room non-stop. "Although things are annoying, you don't have to get so upset. Now that I'm here, I'll have to give you an idea. But the most important thing is to take care of you first! Just now when you were asleep, I saw that you didn't look too good. When Zhang Laoliu brings Dr. Jiao over, you must take some medicine and rest well..."</p>
<p>Before Zhao Yukon could finish speaking, Begonia was already shaking his head on the pillow.</p>
<p>"Who... who wants to invite... what... doctor?... If Mei Bao... doesn't come back... how can my body... get better...!" (213)</p>

<h3>A Report on a Costume Ice Skating Show</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the annual grand costume ice skating show at the Wing On Skating Rink. This reporter attended and will provide the following details: From 3:00 PM, the seats around the rink were completely occupied by spectators. Those who arrived later had to stand at the back. At that time, there was a foreign couple in the center of the rink wearing white Western-style suits, performing various small tricks similar to those of Sonja Henie. When lively music was transmitted through the microphone, they would embrace and dance out the steps of a tango or waltz. One beat, one step; one step, one curve, like birds in the sky and fish in the pond, beautiful and lively, touching the heartstrings of everyone, and triggering a burst of enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM, the costume ice skating began. This time, the program was "Sanben Tie Gongji" (Three Iron Roosters), featuring "Burning Xiang the Adult". Zhang Jiaxiang was played by Ding Jinfu, the ice skating team coach, and Xiang the Adult was played by Shen Weide, the ice skating team captain. These two are both veterans of the ice rink, and their acting, stage presence, skills, and poses were all breathtaking. When Zhang Jiaxiang appeared on stage with a saddle, jumping and shaking, he was both滑稽 and稳重, demonstrating his extraordinary skill in every move. Xiang the Adult's demeanor and lines gave people a relaxed feeling. "Burning Xiang the Adult" featured real swords and guns, and the ice skates raced east, west, south, and north, creating a tense and thrilling atmosphere, making it one of the most exciting scenes.</p>

<h3>Brief Biographies from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(Forty) Ye Shengzhang</p>
<p>Martial clowns traditionally played a supporting role to martial actors, rarely capable of leading a performance. Ye Shengzhang was the first to change that and headline as a martial clown. Shengzhang studied under Wang Changlin, and his rendition of "Hitting the Melon Circle" was considered the most accurate imitation of Changlin. Furthermore, Shengzhang excelled in acrobatics and tumbling, with agility surpassing Changlin's even in his prime. He closely rivaled the deceased Zhang Heijian, with few ever surpassing them. (His "San Cha Kou" is excellent.) However, his voice was hoarse, and his delivery was particularly poor. Martial clowns, commonly known as "opening jumpers," rely on martial skills to showcase their talent. However, without clear articulation and crisp pronunciation, and a forceful, decisive delivery, it is impossible to fully convey the character's emotions. Focusing solely on martial skills is a mistake. In the past thirty years, Zhang Hei and Wang Changlin have been widely regarded as the leading "opening jumpers." Based on what I have witnessed, no one has surpassed them. However, Zhang Hei's later years were spent in Tianqiao, and his twilight years were pitiful. Changlin's reputation, on the other hand, continued to grow, surpassing his former glory. Although their skills were comparable, their fates differed greatly. Just as I was lamenting Zhang Hei's misfortune, I see the prominence of Ye Shengzhang today, whose influence far exceeds Changlin's during his lifetime. What more can I say? Nevertheless, martial clowns have historically been undervalued. Shengzhang's rise has slightly shifted this perception, allowing a suppressed art form to express itself, which is a welcome development. -- End of Brief Biographies from the Pear Garden --</p>
<h3>Jade Flowers in a Rain of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of Its Cage Early</p>
<p>San Gui nodded and said, "The rebel forces are expanding daily, like a fire spreading across the plains. A full-scale suppression is absolutely necessary. I only lament that the previous officials in charge of suppressing the bandits were utterly useless, failing one after another at the hands of the rebels. Not only did they achieve nothing, but they also squandered a great deal of the nation's money and manpower. They are truly incompetent ministers who have harmed the country, a matter of regret and lament. This time, I have been ordered by the Emperor to move a portion of the troops from outside the Pass to the capital to defend the throne and suppress the bandits. This is also the responsibility of us military officials, so I must depart from the Pass in a day or two to make arrangements." Tian Hongyu said with pleasure, "This old man also hopes that the General will leave the Pass as soon as possible and transfer troops here to protect the capital. Not only will the Emperor be reassured and the capital secured, but this old man will also be able to sleep soundly. I hope the General will take care of my family. I would be most grateful." After speaking, he filled a cup of wine and offered it to San Gui. San Gui held the wine cup and said, "I am grateful for your Excellency's esteem for me. In the future, I will definitely send troops to specially protect your esteemed residence. However, I have a presumptuous request, and I hope your Excellency will grant it." Tian Hongyu asked, "What instructions does the General have? As long as it is within my power, I will comply." San Gui smiled slightly and pointed his left hand towards Yuanyuan, saying, "I have no other love in my life, only for beauty. Yuanyuan is a beauty from Jiangnan, whom I have always admired, but my pursuit has been fruitless, causing me great anxiety. If your Excellency would extend your love to others and generously bestow Yuanyuan upon me, then my gratitude would be beyond words. In the future, if there is a rebel invasion, I will do my utmost to protect your Excellency's family, even before protecting the country. With your Excellency's magnanimity, I trust you will believe my words? Please agree to my request quickly." After San Gui said these words, Yuanyuan lowered her head, appearing both shy and pleased. Tian Hongyu, on the other hand, became extremely embarrassed. If he agreed to San Gui's request, the beauty he had acquired with such difficulty would be given to another man to enjoy, which would leave him inconsolable. But if he did not agree, he was relying on San Gui for protection and would have to concede to his demands. (172)</p>
