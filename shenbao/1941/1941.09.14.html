<h3>美國防禦區域範圍　包括全球各處海洋　總統演說實同有限制宣戰　軍艦三百艘開始射擊搜尋</h3>
<p>合衆社十三日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨稱、德國之行動、將決定美國海軍切實行動之範圍、赫爾又言、美國海軍所執行工作之區域、將包括凡足以認爲威脅西半球安全之地點在內、而德國之行動、勢將決定美國海軍將巡邏範圍如何擴大、渠又稱、現時軸心在世界上、企圖以愈速愈妙之姿態、武力征服陸地及海洋、赫爾頗同意某記者之觀察、謂美德之間、本未直接成立所謂封鎖區域及自衛區域、渠又稱、現時之局勢、係由無數演說及公告所造成、並無特別關於目衛區域之詞句、赫爾稱、現時一般人方注意美國企圖在那白拉多建立防禦根據地之事、惟渠對此言亦未進一步加以闡明、赫爾復表示無將羅斯福總統演詞通知德政府之必要云、</p>
<p>路透社十三日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨對新聞記者稱、德國之行爲、將決定何者乃美國所認爲防禦的海洋之區域、而在此區域內美艦可首先射擊云、赫爾於記者請其對於防禦的海洋加以界說時答稱、吾人必不可忘美國現遭遇以征服各大陸與海洋爲目的之世界暴力行動、此反抗的力量、將對於美國可否認爲必須防禦、以便保衛西半球之海洋區域、自必有所申述云、記者繼問以美國現將正式致牒德國抗議攻擊美船事否、赫爾答稱、請參閱總統演詞云、</p>
<p>國際社十三日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾今日在招待新聞記者席上、開釋羅斯福之宣言稱、總統最近曾宣布美國政策、聲明美盤巳奉令、若遭遇軸心國潛艇及其他戰艦、即首先射擊、總統此語、不特適用於大西洋之美國方面、即七大海洋之各部分、凡受德·義戰盤之威脅美國利者、皆可適用之、但赫爾於解釋包括一切之「首先射擊」命令時、一如羅斯福總統然、並未提及日本或日本之戰盤、此間外國外交界僉認、總統之最近行動、係美國方面在大西洋中之實際上宣戰、據悉、美海軍業巳接奉新命令、出發巡邏、以實行首先射擊之宣言、官方稱、後一步之行動、　於希特勒美德間之和戰問題、今應取決於希特勒矣、</p>
<p>路透社十三日紐約電　華盛頓訪電詳論赫爾昨對新聞記者所發關於首先射擊令之言論謂、赫爾詞雖晦澀、而義則顯明、乃對柏林之警告、義謂縣美旗之船、在地球上任何地方敬遭攻擊、則將發生美國報復之可能、以實際言、赫爾言論巳使世界上凡可供航行之海洋、皆可爲美國防禦區域云、</p>
<p>路透社十三日華盛頓電　總統秘書歐萊昨告新聞記者、羅斯福總統之明白演詞、乃美國可在防禦區內首先射擊的唯一界說、演詞播送後、白宮共接到電報一千六百通、除一百五十通外、皆贊同總統主張、據無綫電臺之調查、此次播音聽者極多、計爲八千萬人、佔聽衆百分之六七、較諸初夏總統宣布無限制緊急狀態時、僅少聽衆百分之三、故此次可謂爲美國聽衆史中之第二最多數云、或詢以總統所稱、英國等友邦船隻在合法航程中、將在美國防禦的海洋內、由美艦予以保護一節之意義、歐萊答稱、人人皆知保護之意義、雖稍習英語之校童亦知之云、</p>
<p>路透社十三日紐約電　紐約太陽報華盛頓訪電稱、美總統之演詞、在世人視之、幾同有限制的宣戰、希特勒對之將有何答語、此乃華盛頓人士昨所期待者云、</p>
<p>合衆社十三日華盛頓電　美海軍大西洋巡邏隊、昨首次試騐其首先射擊之搜捕、以搜覓在北大西洋擊沉貨船蒙太那號之潛艇、陸軍部隊巳自冰島根據地與海軍合作、但保衛該處地域之大部份責任、應由大西洋艦隊負之、在過去六月間、大西洋艦隊巳從太平洋方面獲得大量增防、該地域現或仍須增防、</p>
<p>華盛頓十二日電　國際問題評論家、今夜表示意見、相信美國內人民及國會對總統今後任何行動、均將擁護、因過去社會與情響應總統之行動、較對其演說尤爲良好及迅速故也、一般國會領袖、均贊同總統之演說、並一致認爲、此次演說等於宣戰、參議員康納利稱、彼希望美海軍猛烈發砲、斷然對付來襲之艦艇、各大　報之社評、均擁護總統宣布之政策、督促政府續採强硬措置、並要求國人擁護總統云、</p>
<p>合衆社十三日倫敦電　倫敦夜報昨日預言、羅斯福總統發表海洋自由演說之結果、德國將被逼退讓、任令美國原料源源橫渡大西洋、不爾則將對美發生射擊戰爭、「標準夜報」刋載一華盛頓消息、調美艦三百艘巳開始尋覓德國在大西洋之剽襲艦、該報云、第二步決定、操諸希特勒之手、渠至此已在戰爭中遭遇最大之猶疑不決、渠如不退出冰島以西之海面、即將招致對美之射擊戰爭、惟無論其去取如何、渠今日固已遭遇一最大之失敗矣、英官方稱、羅斯福總統已取得美國海陸軍大元帥之權力實無疑義、此外尙有一事至爲明顯、即美艦及飛機在自衛區內將每一德艦尋獲而殲滅之、</p>
<p>國際社十三日倫敦電　英當局評論羅斯福總統演說稱、羅斯福氏巳在大西洋中央劃定界綫、美國現已擔當保護冰島以西大西洋上一切船隻、以東則由英國負職、衆信、德若圖破壞西區海道之安全、唯有冒與美「開戰」之險、英首相邱吉爾、迅將對於羅斯福演說、代英政府發表正式言論、</p>
<p>合衆社十三日莫斯科電　蘇聯副外長米柴夫斯基昨稱、羅斯福總統海上自由之演說、巳予德國以最嚴重之打擊、非僅在政治上之意義巳也、</p>
<h3>德官方聲明</h3>
<p>海通社十三日柏林電　德國官方痛斥羅斯福總統於其演說中揑造事實、故意將美國置於防守者之地位、以便向軸心國作戰、其所稱巳有美船四艘、巴拿馬船一艘遭受攻擊之語、完全與事實不符渠今明白承認已下令美艦隊於必要時攻擊任何軸心艦艇、此舉將迫使德國採取一切必要步驟、羅斯福氏於其昨日之演說中、已向世界人士明白表示、美總統羅斯福對於一切後果、應負全責云、德外交部繼稱、「羅斯福實爲此次歐戰之策動者、由業巳發表之各種文件、可知渠及共黨徒於戰爭爆發前及戰爭爆發後兩年來、曾參加以何種之活動、渠於後助捷克之際、即擬令歐戰爆發、渠及其派往貝爾格勒之特使杜諾又上校·亦千方百計、將南斯拉夫拉入戰局、渠又以飢饉封鎖政策、欲迫使戰敗之法國繼續反德之戰、英·蘇協約·亦爲渠一手造成者、渠係一戰爭狂者、欲使美國人民之感覺爲之糢糊、以便將彼等送上火綫、但如美國人民一旦嘗到戰爭之痛苦、而覺悟時、則已後悔莫及、」柏林官方繼稱「羅斯福之政策、十足表現共猶太族代表之作風、其故無他、蓋猶太族已爲此次戰爭中被淘汰之部分而已、吾人猶憶渠於競選總統時、曾再三表示不使美國捲入戰爭　渦、但今日渠之政策、則無一而非引美國人民入於戰禍、成爲砲灰、以保持英國及猶太人之利益、此次演說之目的、無非欲令美國人民相信、渠係站於防守者之地位、故將被迫而採取保護美國利益之步驟、此數次之事件、均係渠一手造成、以便爲參戰之藉口云、」德國外交部認羅斯福對於格里埃號事件之說明完全與事實不符、已有德國前此所發表之公報可以證明、至於第二次事件、即美國軍艦一艘爲德國潛艇追逐之事、則德國政府根本未有所聞、關於羅斯福所提及之羅賓摩爾號事件、則該船及其船上人員所受之待遇、係完全根據衆所公認之戰爭法規、毫無不法之處、關於「鋼水手」號事件、則德·義旣已明白宣布作戰區域於前、復據美國所發聲明稱、船上又載有軍火、但該船猶貿然駛入作戰區內、自難自辭其咎、至於在蘇彝士運河區內被沉之船隻有否美船在內、則以攻擊係在黑夜、德國方面亦不能確定、關於「西沙」號、旣係懸掛巴拿馬旗幟、美總統自無權顧問其有否沉失、總之、羅斯福總統之全部演辭、完全一己武斷之意、於主要部份、毫不顧及事實、其目的顯欲表示諸如此類之事件、均係德國加於美國軍艦及商船之有計劃的動作而已、美總統所下射擊軸心國艦艇之命令、由美海長諾克斯前此之演說視之、早巳在數月前發生效力、不過羅斯福氏以爲時機尙未成熟未敢明白承認、今則渠認爲時機巳至矣、世界人士均知軸心國毫無侵略野心、故羅斯福氏不得不揑造事實云、德外交部發言人於結論時鄭重表示、美艦隊接受射擊軸心艦艇之命令後、將迫使德國採取一切必要步驟、其因此而引起之結果、應由羅斯福總統負其全責去、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十二日羅馬電　負責方面頃評論羅斯福總統之廣播演說、與美國中立築度、實相抵觸、截止目下爲止、美國在法理上、固尙未式放棄中立也、至於羅斯福氏決定佔據美國領海以外及其利益以外之軍略要點、亦與美國標榜之門羅主義、大相逕庭、羅斯福利用若干意外事件、下令艦隊射擊軸心國一切船隻、其欲小題大做、彰彰明甚、揣其目的、乃在促使美國參戰、所謂海洋自由、並無多大意義可言、僅欲維持盎格魯撒克遜人在海上之覇權而已、</p>
<h3>紐約市塲　貿易活躍</h3>
<p>合衆社十二日紐約電　市塲分析家今日繼續表示、相信股票市塲有向上趨向、惟專家以爲目前之現狀、爲充滿股票之市塲、而非一股票市塲、專家此言、竟蓋謂目前股票之貿易爲選擇性之買賣也、華爾街認爲羅斯福總統之演詞、對股票市塲有建設性、市塲開盤穩定、貿易活躍、棉花前進十三至二十點、收盤時價格稍有波動、惟均有進展、因市塲認爲羅斯福總統之演詞有利也、華爾街認爲總統此言、已將關於美輸在公海一切不淸晰之地位、予以明朗化、又認總統不提及日本、足以表示政府希望就美日異同上、作圓滿之解決、債券今日有波動、芝加哥穀米收盤時稍見低落、</p>
<h3>美國對遠東政策　五年來迄無變更　認與日妥洽說爲奇談</h3>
<p>路透社十三日華盛頓電　上海與東京電訊所表示之樂觀、以爲美日關係現漸入於密切友誼的階段、以代過去十五個月逐漸增甚的緊張者、華盛頓人士未見其有理由、就消息靈通方面所知、美國地位迄未改變、據聞日本現了解、日本必先給予改變心理、而抱誠意之眞正具體證據、而後始可作切實談話、以期銷除兩國間現有之緊張、而據此間意見、非日本脫　離軸心、不能使華盛頓了解日本有改善對美關係之誠意、此非謂美國願作讓步或取消近日加諸日本之經濟制裁、以換取日本之脫離軸心、此問若干方面相信、美當軸抱有一種感念、以爲必有若干重要姿勢、如脫離軸心等舉動、方可使美政府獲有日本確欲改善美日關係之保證、至於日本如有此姿勢、則綏靖政策即將採行或中國將被出賣等推測、則此間未有證據以表明之、實則美國遠東政策至今未變、仍以一九三七年日本侵華後、美國所發表之宜言爲根據、換言之、日本在陷於對華戰爭之泥淖中、迄不能自拔之時、率性逕行致釀成幾與英美開戰之窘境、今若願離此窘境、則脫離軸心僅爲第一步驟而巳、上海傳來消息、似謂美日行將成立大規模妥治者、此問認爲奇談、惟東京所傳日人樂觀與日本報紙暫不指摘美國之消息、則頗引起興趣、而尢注意私人所傳雖東京主戰派與軍閥、現亦感覺恐慌、而思脫離軸心、以期避免對美關係繼續惡化的影響之說、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十二日東京電　據消息靈通方面所知、美、日談判已在上星期抄成立初步協定、其內容日內可望發表、惟出以何種形式、則尙無所聞、所可得而知者、此項協定、當聲明美、日兩國允依各項基本原則、處理彼此兩國關係、至於各項縣案解決辦法、則未涉及、質言之、此項協定乃欲規定後此兩國保證不以兵戎相見、而當設法和平解決彼此間各項政治問題、俾得逐漸恢復正常經濟財政關係、</p>
<h3>中國官民堅持立塲</h3>
<p>路透社十三日重慶電　此問一般華人對於外傳華盛頓討論結果、美·日協定之條款業巳決定之說、雖不甚置信、但疑慮之心理、則漸見滋長、衆信此項談話或已進展、超逾「試探之階段」、華方各領袖皆信、上述協定條款已決定之謠諑、或係日方所傳出、雖決非解決之最後條件、但多少或可代表日方之提議、彼等不信美國將犧牲中國以綏靖日本、不先商諸中國而即接受最後之解決條件、或接受明知中國所不能允許之條件、華方官塲及民衆皆堅持日軍一日不退出中國領土、中國將繼續抵抗不巳、據此間所接華盛頓可恃華方消息、謂美國亟欲與日本臻與妥協、俾以全力應付大西洋之發展、但若干華方人士不信美國在大西洋之地位、將使其有綏靖日本之必要、因美國無須用其海軍之主力以對付大西洋中之德剽龍船艦也</p>
<p>海通社十三日維希電　外交界相信、美駐法大使李希上將、昨晤法元首貝當、係對日大使加藤與法協理達朗之會商有直接關係、聞李希曾通知貝當、美日在遠東之術突　已不能　免、大約李希曾與貝當討論越南之問題、並通知貝當倘日本在越南之防軍若再增加、英、美將被迫採取某種對策、</p>
<h3>中野演說兩點用意</h3>
<p>路透社十三日東京電　日本唯一復活政黨東方會之領袖中野正剛、今日午後在此演講、以答覆英相邱吉爾及美總統羅斯福、聽者有東京市民數千人、此外更有數千人立於演講聽外、由擴音機收聽、中野預料、美·日戰爭將早日爆發、對於英·美·日戰爭將早日爆發、對於英·美·日三國間之解決機會、不甚置信、謂倘使談判失敗、日本準備奮鬥至最後一人、中野又在其非經官方授意、亦必曾核准之演辭中、警告勿延長華盛頓談話、以免日本失去南進之時機、中野續謂、油類爲日本在輸血中所急需之血液、並警告此項血液無從獲得之時或將到臨、至時、吾人之飛機、均將停放地面、無法上升矣、美國現已爲援英事宜所獨佔、故與日本作戰將屬「毫無意義」、倘使日本派其五百艘軍艦及四千　架飛機、前往南太平洋威脅新加坡、馬尼刺及澳洲、則英、美將難應付、是以其促請軸心國取道高　加案及波斯海　採取攻勢、而與日本會合於新加坡、各晚報對於此項演詞多未刋睹顯著地位、唯有中外商業新聞載於前幅、TOAK電臺之規定新聞節目中、亦未予以提及、東京各外國觀察家皆信、中野之演說、不外兩種用意、（一）試探民衆對於美·日局勢之情緒、（二）促美國從速順從日本之提議、晨報中以前幅登載此演辭者祇有國民新閱、謂此演說之目的大約係專對外人、一般人對於中野之演說、雖祇認爲係一有力而少數之政黨領袖所發表的意見、不甚加以重視、惟在今日緊張時局他人正力持審愼及緘默之際、發表此項大胆言論、殊不無相當重要意義、同時一般悲觀主義、現又有滋長現象、</p>
<h3>日閣續有　改組行動</h3>
<p>合衆社十三日東京電　內閣昨繼續有迅速之改組行動、觀察家相信、此舉目的、因德·蘇戰爭、並爲對付「世界局勢之改變、」以滿足公衆之反　而作、官方稱、「陸軍部之調動日的、爲保證陸軍長官及　　東京政策之密切合作、以更效忠於日皇」、觀察家又稱、即有派人士亦得與任何近衛之新政策合作、蓋右派領袖目前　亦屬保守　之手也、</p>
<h3>菲報人羅摩洛　由港抵渝</h3>
<p>重慶　菲律賓報界鉅子羅摩洛Gitrlos　P．Romulo、前日由馬尼刺抵港、今晨來渝、稍憇後即往行政院、謁秘書長蔣廷　、羅氏能留渝四五日、擬覲見蔣委員長、蓋八一三戰事勃發前一日、羅氏曾謁蔣、爲外藉記者中獲悉日本如果挑戰、中國決予抵抗、而向美國確切報告之第一人、此外、羅氏並將分謁政府各當局及社會各界領袖、然後取道昆明、轉往仰光·新加坡·巴達維亞等地、蒐集報告、（十三日哈瓦　社電）</p>
<h3>南洋日僑　撤退回國</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>從大西洋風雲說到美日關係</h3>
<p>自從上月七日起，美國船艦之被德國潛艇飛機蓄意襲擊者·已不下五六起之多，其中除美國軍艦兩艘雖遭剽襲却未受損外，其他縣掛美旗的商船，則已有三艘被擊沉失：最後一艘「蒙太那」號甚至是在羅斯福總統發表强硬演說，宣佈「首先射擊」政策數小時後纔被擊的，因此不難想像德國艦機今後定必變本加厲，在各處海面襲擊美船，同時美國海空兩軍亦必依照總統命令，加緊搜索，迎頭痛擊。在這種情形之下，大西洋上的緊張局勢·當然含着一觸即發的重大危機·雖說美國未必因此立即對德作戰，但形勢的異常嚴重·却是無可否認的事實。</p>
<p>美德關係的惡化，原非一朝一夕之事，今後如何演變，明若觀火·似乎已不必再事推測，値得檢討的，倒是德國何以不先不後，偏偏在近日，尤其是在盛傳美日行將妥協的此際，突然一變其開戰以來力避刺激美國的作風，公然襲擊其船艦而直認不諱，一若其已決心迫令美國參戰。大體上分析起來，德國對美態度的轉變，可能有下開數項原因：第一，納粹對蘇戰事遷延不決，其勢必須拖過冬季，希特勒鑒於英國最近在菲洲和近東的步步進逼，以及前幾天英加聯軍在挪威北部的鋒芒小試，似乎已在躭憂英國倘若提早反攻，將使軸心腹背受敵，因此寗願冒觸怒美國的危險，決以全力阻遏英國得自大西洋彼岸的接濟。第二，希特勒明知遲早必與美國決裂，與其等待羅斯福政府利用其廣大無匹的物力人力，完成整個國防程序，不如提前迫其參戰，又况在美日談判尙無具體成就的今日，招致美國參戰，至少還可藉以迫使羅斯福不敢把太平洋方面的海空實力，全部調至大西洋對德作戰。第三，美日談判的進行，不問雙方能夠妥協到何種程度，多少總於德國不利，假定日本今後果眞背棄軸心，投入英美懷抱，則對於希特勒現在業已相當動搖的聲望，差不多更是一個致命的打擊，因此他必須「出奇制勝」，做出將和美國決裂的姿態，以期「拖住」日本，鼓勵日本不要中途放棄「利用軸心聲勢，乘機在太平洋樹立覇權」的政策，至低限度，希特勒希望以「在大西洋上威脅美國的方式」，抬高日本在對美談判中討價還價的地位，俾日感孤立的東京政府不致百分之百接受英美的條件；這不僅是一種非常微妙的「苦肉計」，而且更是一粒用以安慰日本一班親德派份子的「定心丸」；因爲德蘇戰後，日本國內抱怨三國同盟的輿論，以及懷疑軸心能否致勝的情緒，確已逐漸抬頭，希特勒深知此際若再無足以勸服日本的實際行動，則勢將失掉這位「成事不足敗事有餘」的東方盟友。</p>
<p>據於上述，可見德國此次在大西洋和紅海方面的迭次襲擊美船，確和進行多時的美日談判，不無關聯，雖則美日談判本身，截至目下爲止，依然還是迷離恍惚，令人不易捉摸其究已達到何種階段。東京方面的宣傳，不日進行順利，即謂雙方已在原則上成立協定，但觀於羅斯福總統在隔日演說中並無隻字道及，足見成立協定之說，絕不可靠，又况日方自稱已在上星期杪（九月六日）成立協定，但赫爾國務卿却在本星期四（九月十二日）還說美日談話「未有新的發展」，以羅斯福赫爾二氏平時態度的坦白公正，斷沒有談判已在一週前完成，却猶隱瞞不言的道理。雖說羅斯福總統在隔昨嚴詞斥責德國的時候，並未像英相邱吉爾那樣同時指摘日本，似乎多少含有顧全日本的意昧。但一則或者這是雙方談話正在進行中一國元首應有的「禮貌」，二則隔昨演說的唯一對象，原在答復德國的海盜行爲，而並非泛論一般國際時局，他連蘇聯戰事都無一字提及，即其明證。所以關於美日談話近日有何進展，世人不妨在相信美國決不背棄八項原則，決不改變反侵略政策的信念之下，靜待華盛頓當局正式說明，而不必因爲若干謠言，徒自驚擾。須知美日關係無論有何新發展，其中萬變不離其宗，至少有一點事實已經確定不移，那就是說：今後的遠東大局，必然是民治集團的綜合力量日趨强固，所以不論如何，對於維護正義的中國，必然是有百利無一害的。</p>

<p>（二）問華軍收復福州獲取全勝、其戰鬥經過、詳情如何、答、華軍旣決定收復福州後、三路均開始動作、閩江右岸華軍、突擊目標爲福淸城、八月二十五日薄暮後、分向福淸北門及海口攻擊、二十六拂曉前、攻克福淸城、日軍紛向海口退去、廿七晚、海口增援日軍千餘、在日機掩護下、作猛烈反撲、福淸旋又陷日手、九月一日、華軍又施攻擊、並將主力加入、兩度進攻、士氣旺盛、銳不可當、日不支逃去、華於二日再克復福淸城、復追擊敗日、入晚、又克海口、日軍由海口落艦逸去、華軍另一部乘勝挺進、收復長樂城、於是閩江右岸之日軍即告肅淸、閩江左岸連江方面、華軍攻擊部隊八月二十五晚向三岡麋石攻擊、一部向潘渡出擊、是晚佔領三岡、旋日軍增援數百反撲、華軍乃轉進浦口·幕浦附近、轉向連江攻擊、二十六晨佔領雲岱山、日軍感窘迫、乃以猛烈砲火阻華軍前進、華爲牽制誘惑日人計、於三十日經浦口轉下洋附近、續向潘渡之日軍作小規模之接觸、九月一日、華眞面目攻擊開始、主力加入作戰、向連江攻擊前進、一部由廖洋向潘渡攻擊前進、與日激戰後、佔領潘渡、繼向湯嶺降虎進擊、並乘勝攻入連江城、日分向中岩山·江南橋退走、旋琯頭日軍七八百、附砲多門、向江南橋增援、並藉飛機掩護、向華反攻、企圖保持此側後重要據點、戰况慘烈、日軍復犯連江城、是晚華軍預備隊加入作戰、士氣大振、再向連江城猛攻、經激烈戰鬥後、卒於三日晨再克連江城、並獲日砲數門、其他戰利品甚多、華軍並跟踪追擊、又佔領琯頭要點、由福州出海之閩江北道、即爲華控制、日軍經長門落艦逸去、福州方面華軍、一部二十五晚由白沙關源裏前進、二十六晨佔南溪山、二十七曉佔十脚山大泡頂之綫、繼迫日軍大嵐山·桐岑日軍陣地、二十九日曾以一部主力、秘密推進、以待福淸·連江方面華襲擊部隊之捷報、即一鼓以全力推進福州、並曾一度夜襲岑頭、予日重創、三十日以後、日機出動、阻止華軍之攻擊、惟此方面主力似未被日軍發覺、即日晨潛入福州城、及南台一帶之便部隊、得民衆協助、積極擾亂破壞、日軍乃急調海軍陸戰隊晴川大隊、經南台開入福州增援、一日拂曉、華秘密準備三四日之英勇主力部隊、突以一部進襲福州外圍要點之桐口及筆架山、此綫爲日主要防綫、戰鬥激烈、二日晨、華另一部隊又加入作戰、卒將日軍擊潰、於二日夜攻下桐口、三日晨佔領奶奶坪·湖頂山·岑頭各據點、至此日盤據福州之主要防綫、盡入華手、福淸·長樂·連江華軍、攻擊亦極得手、日後路形勢頗形危急、福州日軍勢呈動搖、華攻擊部隊乘勢加緊攻擊、南路攻克洪山橋、復轉戰而前、經洪山橋·福州南台·渡島江向江邊角突入疾進、北路華軍則疾由北包頭·小店·福州·向馬尾追擊日軍主力、一部包圍攻擊福州城、日軍在華夾攻之下、進退失據、紛紛退走、三日晨八時、華軍遂正式收復福州城、十時進佔城外之南台、日軍掩護退却部隊盤據鼓嶺·鼓山　帶抵抗、華軍挾戰勝餘威、血戰一日、迄晚鼓山日軍向馬尾敗退、華軍追擊部隊跟踪搜擊、遂於四日晨將馬尾日軍掃數肅淸、是役、福淸連江及桐口等地爭奪激烈、日軍陣亡甚衆、</p>
<p>獲捷原因</p>
<p>（三）問華軍獲捷之原因安在、答、（一）日軍盤據福州形勢孤立、因日軍佔福州後、即在華軍控制之下、蓋囚福淸桐口大小北嚴迄連江之綫、無從擴展、其外圍防禦綫之兵力、亦不敷分配、欲圖固守、實極困難、（二）華各級指揮部、對攻克福州之信心堅決、並用相機配合、先切斷福州後路、再以主力乘勢猛擊、使日軍無從容佈置之餘暇、故得一舉而攻克福州城、（三）華將士咸抱雪恥之心、忠勇奮發而、福淸·長樂·福州·連江各地民衆、羣赴配合行動、用能完成任務、切奏其功、（四）特務戰配合適宜、八月三十一日華便衣隊混入福州城、先期破壞日軍福州馬星間之電訊、並在南台從縱火擾亂日人後方、以使利主力部隊之攻擊、總之、八月二十五日金綫出擊後、於三數日之間、攻下日盤　下之城池及據點三十餘處、得有利策應福州之進攻、而民衆方面之能奮起協助、尤爲此次　功之主要原因、（十二日電）</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（七九）蘇聯的廣土眾民</h3>
<p>這篇是紐約泰晤士報的紀載，茲譯錄如左：</p>
<p>外國人到蘇俄去所得的第一個印象祇是「廣大」。蘇俄的領土佔全球地面六分之一到七分之一。除去北部和西伯里亞人烟稀少寒威逼入的一片荒蕪，和中亞細亞的廣大沙漠而外，還留下極大的區域，裏　有着各種不同的氣候和溫慶，伴着各層文化的人民，自愛期茶謨土著，以至世界聞名的學者和科學家都有。</p>
<p>在高加索相中亞細亞，有綿亙不絕的山脈，高聳雲霄的山峯。然而蘇俄典型的風景，就在顯示其國土範圍的廣大。平原廣野，極目所至，幾於漫無邊際。十一年前，蘇聯政府，因土耳其斯坦通達西伯利亞的新織路正式通車，曾邀請各國新聞記者前往參觀通車典禮，他們行了六天之久，方纔到達目的地。</p>
<p>在此「廣大」的印象之外，還可得到一個「衆庶的印象。全世界在一個日政單位內所包含的白種人，爲數之多，當以蘇俄爲首屈一指，居民不下一萬七千萬，而現時成爲戰區的新兼　各地，尙小計在內。全部俄國史大抵以向外擴張爲主，有時且和接近西洋文明的民族相抗，像瑞典人和波蘭人即其例。俄國雖曾遭受不少軍事上的敗續，然自十三世紀爲韃靼人所蹂躪以後，沒有一個征服者能使這土廣民衆的國家唯命是從。</p>
<p>俄國自然地理上的一個特點，可由人民心理上反映出來，就是過於趨向極端。溫和的歐洲大陸上面，沒有一處可以找到像西伯里亞這樣的嚴寒和中亞細亞沙漠這樣的酷熱。即使蘇聯政府尸創立若干統一標準，實際上幾乎使人人都研究同一的思想，閱看同樣的報紙，且由紡織廠織造布疋，以代替農家自紡的紗布，和昔日所穿形形式式光怪陸離的服裝，然由明斯克到海參崴，或由莫斯科到高加索成克里米亞，沿途仍可見到很多不同的種族。</p>
<p>俄維斯人的佔蘇聯全人口一半以上。該國立於歐洲方面的南部諸省，平原沃野，住在那裹的以烏克籣農民爲主。而山嶺起伏的高加索境內，則混合雜居着許多種族和部落，雖地處沂隣，而彼此言語不通，類此者殆不多見。</p>
<p>俄國是一個歐亞混合國，觀於俄國人的國民性和心理，可知她巳錯過了解放個性有極大供獻的三種運動：一是宗敎改革，二是文藝復興，三是法國革命，還有一層，歐洲其他國家抗拒君中專制的各種要素，如有勢力的貴族，或自由市，或士民中的重要階級等，在俄國亦是一無所有。中古時代的俄國暴君，如「可怖的伊凡之類，可任意誅戮一個最有勢力的貴族，像殺却一個最微賤的農奴一樣容易。此種傳統習慣，在史丹林政府之下，却依然保存着。</p>
<p>蘇聯的文學和音樂，深受東方文明的影響。其最大的抒情詩人普希余和萊蒙托夫，常描繪高加索的風尙。還有林斯基高索柯夫的戲劇或俄國歌舞，都具有東方色彩。蘇聯在亞洲部份的陸地邊界綫特別長，因此俄羅斯人與土耳其人，波斯人，中國人及其他亞洲人的接觸，也遠較歐洲人爲密切，可是俄國對於東方的人種學和探險工作，貢獻却小很大。</p>
<p>俄國人的個性，思想，甚至靈魂，很有許多特點，雖經外界劇烈的變化，亦能維持不變。</p>
<p>俄國人常富於抽象的思想。像杜基涅夫，托爾斯泰，柴霍甫等偉大作家，時而敦厚，時而諷刺。他們十九世紀的智識分子，常憧憬着未來完美的世界，甚至可說俄國全部文化，都具此種理想，（十九世紀以前，俄國除宗敎藝術以外，殆無所謂文明）。至於外國人—譬如德國人—却能從實際方面把個殘缺的世界，儘量加以改善。</p>
<p>這種極端的自由思想，雖是很文明，很動人，有時終嫌過於理想而不切實用，後來便被革命潮流所掃蕩了。可是它在共產牛義之下，仍能保持共勢力。蘇俄當局擬具二個　大的五年經濟計劃，其中包羅萬象，自鋼鐵工業以至理髮小店，無不通盤籌算，恐怕除了蘇俄之外，其他民族未必會想得到吧！</p>
<p>記者在僑居蘇俄期間，常深深的感到俄國人腦筋中充滿了完善主義，而於中庸之道，妥協本能，和循序漸進的性質，幾於全付闕如。譬如說，假使一個共產黨員舉出幾個在外國制度下遭學摧殘犀迫的例子，無論何人若去對他說，現在蘇聯政制下受到摧殘壓迫的正不知有多少，他總是會絲毫不理睬的。</p>
<p>共產主義是新顥的，但這完善主義的思想，却與俄國人有生以俱來。尼古拉貝狄蒂Nicholas　Berdaeli是俄國現代思想家中最著名的一人，曾經發表過精確的理論說，英國沉浸於日由主義，法國醉心於　疑主義，但道兩柿主義是絕對不適台於俄國人心理的</p>
<p>在杜斯托夫斯基的小說中，隨處可以看到俄國人非常傾向於精神上的極端，富有探測人類心靈隱微的能力，而於中庸之道則十分不耐。俄國大革命時，智識階級因研究和接觸西洋文明而受其薰陶，希望繼沙皇政治之後，另行樹立一種新政體，尊重個人人格及公民自由，但他們所遭受的失望和物質上精神上的痛苦，是可不言而喻的。</p>
<p>俄國人有一種驚人的能力，易把理想當作事實。他們說明將來的計劃，常似已經付諸實施一般，語語逼眞，不加渲染。幻想已作成思想和實行間的橋樑，而把它們聯繫起來了。這種想像力，用於藝術方面，便可產生輝煌的傑作。俄國在文化上最顯著的成功，允其是在文學和音樂方面，都是十九世紀中獲得的，而且牠的發展極速，和英法德等國文化的逐漸進步不同。就藝術上說，俄國人的天賦是在中人以是的</p>
<p>和這幻想能力與藝術稟賦密切聯繫的，還有聰明和創作力，也是他們得大獨厚之處。舉例來說，大隊傘兵從犬而降，實爲近代戰爭中最驚心怵目的戰術，發明者却是紅軍，但在這决歐戰未爆發之前，誰也不能斷定傘兵將給與戰爭以何種重大的影響。司是以紅軍在蘇芬戰爭中的表現，與德國傘兵在荷蘭及克里特島諸戰役中的成績相比較，眞有霄壤別了</p>

<p>此次黑滙市塲之取消、能否實現、目前猶未可期許、　孳孳爲利之銀行家、固有不少願爲中國幫忙、但難免亦有喜歡在黑弄堂中玩把戲夾縫裏撈外快、一旦如將黑滙市塲取消、在數年來吃慣好胃口之大腹賈、或在懾於本國政府之命令、或者不勝公理良心之責備、不得不將「就口饅頭」權且放下、然而外滙旣有限制、乃貪圖此零三一二五的佣金、試問此吃慣用慣住洋房坐汽車之大班式老夫、難道眞個秋天到了、叫他們喝露水不成、固不料昨天市塲上、沉寂五日之黑滙市，父見死灰復燃、東方滙理銀行售出現貨美滙四元八一二五、由非必需品之進口洋行扒得、市勢略趨軟化、直至正午後未續做開、午收英匯二辦士八四三七五、美余四元八一二五、比上日價的英緊〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、下午週六無市、據滙票間某君談、下週一（明日）英美等十四家銀行爲挽救本市進出口商行之繁榮計、將恢復黑市之外匯買賣、是吾實　待證云、查東方滙理銀行不在十四家外商銀行之列、但旣不在十四家之列、何以東方滙理銀行手中之美滙、竟可游離於凍結資余之拘束、仍可自由買賣、又何以其他亦有繼起辦理之說、如是則所謂凍結所謂取消黑滙市塲、乃是大滑其稽、想英美政府旣勸吿其商人遵守於前、不數日而父反汗於後、不將使人對英美大國之舉措、視爲兒戲、故可決其無此事、不觀昨日報載外匯市况內對華商在美行之美匯存款戶、因無法提現、故四出兜售、予非必須品之進口洋行、得在美國銀行劃賬一節、頃悉美國銀行劃賬之消息、完全不確、即此一端、焉知昨日市塲所傅明日英美行家中有恢復黑匯說爲無稽、然而人心叵測、惟利是圖、無間華洋、黑匯市塲中之黑匯、統制範圍中之不統制、不能必其無、惟如果黑匯公然恢復、勢必發生兩種匯價、一高一低、高低之間之好處、仍爲中間撈外快的拿去、不供給外匯之物價固高、即供給外匯之物價、亦必帶高、公定匯價之供給、有其名、無其實、一切外匯買賣行市、勢必俱跟黑滙走、此種偷天換日手段、損傷了外匯匯基金、苦壞了大衆生計好了一班與外匯有關的大腹賈、照理論說、固不應有此種畸形變態之事實、亦爲事實之所不應有、但有說、外匯申請　消保證、安知不爲所請准之外匯、流用到別處去的緣故、此亦未免逆臆、惟爲大衆福利計、自以外匯愈整肅愈好、且看市塲所傳是吾不成爲事實、想當不遠、</p>
<p>香港十三日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤平穩異常、各匯均無榮辱、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津十三日（遇六）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、倫敦及紐的電匯仍無榮辱、申匯降落五角、爲九十元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤三角七分、爲五十元〇七角九分、</p>
<h3>現金又有搜羅　重出九千元外</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市塲、期貨改以香港申滙爲新標準結價、聲浪甚高、但仍在審愼考慮中、有下週一閃审開做說、致十月期金多空仍在不斷了結中、雖香港方面有中日和平謠傳、但外滙黑市忽有做開、市價帶軟、補空較殷、由六千八百六十二元升至六千八百七十五元、終軋升七元、成交八白餘兩、現金亦續向上進展、突出九千元外、乃某銀行又有搜維訊也、自晨開做巳高二十元、合盛進大豐十兩、爲八千九百六十元、天元忽來進大贊十兩、爲八千九百七十元、又進德成十兩、祥和二十兩、義豐七十兩、爲八千九百九十元、祥和進天元·永成·大豐四十兩、爲九千元及九千零十元、同康永進天元二十兩、穗孚叫十兩、爲九千零三四十元、爲義豐·聯興售出、市勢一度趨平、德孚忽復進成記五十兩、祥和進鑫源·永安·益大等八十兩、升至九千〇五十元、祥興永·德孚售出、步遜至九千〇十元、祥和·永成各進天元等三五十兩·提升至九千（四十元、祥興永·成記再各售五十兩、最後德順出鑫源十兩、爲九千〇十元、比上日軋升七十元、成交六百餘兩、金號本牌金門市售價九千〇五十元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、首飾金軋平、仍九百二十元、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>期貨軋漲　元</p>
<p>烚赤十月期晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市仍爲六千八百六十二元、成記恒記先後補進一稍提升至六千八百七十五元、爲順源等吐出、常見回下、午收六千八百六十九元、軋升七元、當日高低亦十三元、</p>
<p>飾金欲升又止</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行上午十時掛升十元、爲九白卅元、但至十點半即回下、仍掛九百二十元、收進减五十元云、</p>
<p>美鈔需要愈殷</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、現金價繼續挺漲、英美金鎊因亦各漲五元、英余票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票需要愈殷、一度拉至一十一元七角、午收二十一元四角半、比上日軋升二角半、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票均趨漲勢、前者升爲二元三角四分、後奢高至一元九角一分、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗風頭不健　一漲即復入疲境</h3>
<p>上日回昂之紗市、昨則又復向入軟境矣、但趨勢尙屬和緩、所以下跌迂迥、不過投機商的心理、謂上日高峰復達一千七百六十八元、未能穿見新高價、於是有一部份轉向做空、又云暫時不致有大竄頭來、所以意志趨向於下風、其實根本問題、深恐仍在廻旋之境也、至於現紗銷路、雖無躉批的發展、但港幫零星交易、較爲活絡一步、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百六十六元、低價爲一千七百五十一元、收醫價爲一千七百五十一元、午後因週尾無市、今日有棉紗三百七十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣尙緊、首盤價爲　千七百六十五元、少頃因多頭落、跌至一千七百六十一元、然檯面上逢小購進奢頗不乏人、又升至一千七百六十六元、嗣後取引所開盤鬆落、人心較懈、然檯面上賣者未湧、一經在一千七百六十元之間往返、爲時甚久、迨至收盤、因取引所價仍舊不振、浮多吐出、疲落至一千七百五七一元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千七百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　八·五〇〇　香港　二〇〇</p>
<p>統計　八·七〇〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、由微堅而下游、脚地似露浮動、蓋美棉升勢、巳見减退、國際間之展開、亦無重大刺激、其捕風捉影之謠傳、乃爲投機家之故技、是以未能久持、頓又雲散、以致市氣兎起鶻洛、似無續堅之力、當上午開盤、先因廠單堅定、九月期頗有補空、一時走勢仍挺、爲一六六八元、幾近高價開盤、入後近期仍覺穩定、十月期爲一六七九元、開出微高三元、旋經取引所帶疲、廠單隨之下墮期紗乏力支撑、終入疲途、故十一月期自一六九二元、開盤節節而下、幾近低價收市、可見各幫似有絡繹脫手之意、半日間高低參　、僅五元至十元起伏、大戶因週末正無有所顧忌、故交易殊爲淸閑、結果九月期爲一六六五元收市、　尙略好一元、十月期爲一六七五元、則跌一元、十一月期萎頓更甚、獨低至一六八二元五角收市、乃降落七元五角之多、觀走勢、多方若未能繼以良好消息、持久與吾、當視潛力、故前途或有迂迥之可能也、下午無市、茲將成交價格、列表於後、</p>
<h3>週六棉市　成交減色</h3>
<p>現棉情况無大活動、因來源小爽、且美棉狀况堅挺、但廠方稍有納胃、所以人心轉佳、不過做開皆屬印棉爲夥、其他存底日薄、加以週六關係、各方咸乏有力影響、致成交甚爲减色也、</p>
<p>另訊埠外棉交易、市况仍無多大發展、蓋廠方與各花號雖具購意、但格於不能進行外滙結款、及船期一再延遲、實際成定不多、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、晨初先因華盛頓政治消息利多、及氣候不利而漲、市况甚爲堅昂、但續後又因一部分浮多吐出而跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日約漲五至十一磅昔不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因散戶售出、及多頭了結而跌、但續後又因歐洲出口商買進回漲、結果昨日收盤價格漲一至四維比左右、又預測今日開盤市况看漲〇二五羅比、</p>
<h3>證卷　內債市氣仍堅</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市爲週六、祇做上一盤、因人心堅强、繼續良好、丙種又穿出二元關、幾度進關、終仍　出、可見行市之穩定、環境上尙無　着之變化、昨日上午開盤信孚仍有進胃、潤德生大亦有吸收、一斑散戶收買亦熱鬧、丙種又見七十二元三角行市、嗣以公茂怡泰協康等賣出、一度回小至二元、旋以二元二角收盤、其他各種亦無不爲之帶好、結果一律冉漲　三四角、成交數約一百四十萬元左右、茲列簡明　於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股一百股、價爲三十三元七角半、</p>
<p>倫敦十二日（週九）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國公債祇善後英金回升一鎊、價爲三十八鎊、英股則驟呈起色、上海電車股升三便士、價爲十五先令九便士、開平煤礦股續升一先令六便士、價爲十五先令六便士、朝鮮煤礦股亦升一先令六便士、價爲五先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米滯銷　拋空亦旺</h3>
<p>邇來洋米、似趨盤旋之狀、時尚不脫此種狀態、早市開手、實銷方面、旣又以價高棘手、而皮球交易似又乘勞拋空、原根客販、遂亦繼之相競、於是市面頓吿復軟、各價再度下游、若銀行棧小絞貶開百零六元、詛意此時忽有鄕莊客戶出手採辦外棧小紋、一時爲數雖屬有限、而已頓見俏色、向昔比銀行棧貨素須別低一元至元半、至此竟將與銀行棧貨並駕齊驅、祇別半元光景、初自百零五元躍開百零六元半、而銀行棧小絞雖亦相繼帶高、但祇抵百零六元半、百零七元、至於其他各貨、因本街去路始終不暢、依然一路垂軟缺乏變化、較前市收價悉降一二元不等、英華司碎米九十一元、小絞一百三十三元至一百三十二元半、亦比前市略疲、全日成交現米二萬三四千包、英華司二百多噸、</p>
<p>厚薄破梗及新粳等國米、南港早稻昨突以來源雨阻到貨寥落、貨主售心轉堅、同時本鄕作客都乘貶後活動、納意亦濃、故價頓見回昂一二元、開一百五十元、百四十八元、厚梗乏貨缺乏交易、做開極微、未有榮辱、浦東新粳猶以貨鮮胃香、繼續挺秀、雖行情表面、仍僅一百五十三兀至一百五十二元、實則貨別優劣、已暗提元硯焉、</p>
<p>糯米普通貨去路感少、是雖貨稀亦難立足、見貶近元、開一白十三四元至二十一元、不過特別貨、尙以銷廣頗俏、繼售一百二十七八元、糯茶則唯次貨馬首是瞻、相隨跟低一元、開一百十一元、一百十元、</p>
<h3>洋粉升降微細</h3>
<p>昨洋粉市况互有出入、惟升降微細、亦在平正時間之應有波動而已、金龍牌坎粉實銷活潑、新到之浦東棧貨允爲本客歡迎、在棧價開三十一元三角後步升至三十一元四角半、西棧初在三十元零七角槃旋、收市三十元零八角、乃比前市漲一二角、惟美粉有定貨電洽與途貨收到、砲台自三十二元五六角回至三十二元三四角收市、香蕉三十二元一元至三十二元、則較小二二角、全日成交仍有三萬包、實銷與囤戶各占半數、小麥仍有零星抵埠、市價朱有出入、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油源源抵埠</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况現疲期平、查現貨因生豆油逐有源源抵埠、兼以常錫帶亦有躉額來滬、而實銷呆滯難暢、故市勢頗爲萎軟、聞靑島生油買價又見减低十元、在　百六十元左右、惟菜油及棉子油則以業外投機商欲圖竭力支持、故行情盤旋尙平、昨市交易甚爲淸閒、計售開九月下交大有廠淸油三千餘担、價爲百六十九兀至一百七十一元、又日華廠菜油近千桶、價一百六十九元至一百七十二元、又泰山廠菜油一百桶、價一百六十元、尙有本街問津江北豆油一百五十聽、價爲二百三十八元、昨由天津來生油一千五百聽、豆子三百包、今日有五百包轉運香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　實銷雖無新發展　棉布廠盤甚緊</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢平淡、實銷無新發展、而廠盤甚緊、同業及囤戶大都採辦觀望態度、故市價檳持無上落、惟少數缺檔貨仍見提價、本街批發號採辦二百餘件、粵港幫需要稍增、辦粗布卡其斜紋色布等三百餘件、南洋幫辦粗布漂染布二百數十件、今日有疋頭一千三白七十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　取引所棉布九月跌四角、十月跌叫角四分、十一月跌一角半、十二月跌二角四分、現布售盤跌一角左右、四君子嗶嘰跌五厘、成交甚稀、因市面無待色、及週末之關係、</p>
<h3>新秋呢絨暢銷</h3>
<p>時値新秋、天氣轉凉、毛貨呢絨銷路、步見暢達、中西裝衣料、實銷激增、本街呢絨綢緞洋貨諸門莊幫、男女色服裝幫及新舊衣莊幫、雨衣大衣作塲、鞋帽作塲等、零躉需胃均健、客幫因受統制與打搬運證困雄關係、故刻下祇南京幫有採辦、而內外行囤塌春夏秋冬貨品、依然暢繁、以致市塲趨勢更爲忙碌、昨豐大條子駱駝絨每碼齊沽八元半、維雙鹿圖十二元、元豐飛馬圖花呢四十八元、寅豐草綠華特呢六十八元、大華收羊圖五十五元、福泰頭號西裝呢九十元、拷花大衣呢二百二十元、華達馬棕緞四元、五豐棉織馬褲呢三元八角、友生防雨布六元四角、寅豐一四七〇法西襯二元二角、黑炭襯六二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　核桃獻新龍口粉回降　新湘蓮歩跌</h3>
<p>首批天津桃、昨由津幫運到三十八袋、當即見樣、今庚出水甚佳、旋以二百元如數售通、聞申幫後批亦有辦到、市衆暫平、　龍口綫粉于、前市曾到二百十元、後因南洋幫去胃漸弱、而本街亦僅少數交易、近日祇有甬幫辦過百餘包、查申底漸增、故現市降去二十餘元之譜、</p>
<p>本湖蓮見新後、到貨見增、咋晨漢口幫開出三十餘包、已破四百元關、爲三百九十五元、行售三百九十八元、市象有回緊可能、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價迅速回落</h3>
<p>昨糖市凶太平洋局勢和緩、來源暫無問題、人心見軟、價乃轉降、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、九月份新貨一百三十四元三角、八月份一百三十四元、三十三元七角、小元半、七月份一百三十三元、小一元七角、六月份一百三十二元四角、小二元一角、香港粗白一百二十四元八角、二十四元、降度相仿、荷赤一百二十四元、市勢較平、餘乏成交</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟再度下降</h3>
<p>香烟市情跌風勢如破竹、蓋廠方不斷供給、、致各方人心極度恐慌、市上現貨異常暢達、故價猛瀉、做開市面再暴降數百餘元、計大英牌二千一百五十元老刀牌一千五百元、五華牌一千零七十元、仙女牌一千一百三十元、品海牌一千三百五十元、二十枝大南未每萬一千三百元、惟昨華成頤中兩公司之行盤、宣吿加價、茲將新價詳載市價欄、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦尾湧到暴跌　冬菰貝叫小數百元</h3>
<p>蝦尾近以各方有到、而價値過高、價乃暴跌、昨山打根尾開八百元朝邊尾叫一千六百元、烟台龍鬚島尾及江北尾亦紛紛趕到、市象更弱、竟至無人問津、干貝叫一千四百元、其餘冬古香古雖各叫跌數百元、行方均觀望不前、致乏市正、</p>

<h3>美商銀行美匯存款　不得售予進口商　存戶四出兜售企圖劃賬　各銀行奉指示一律拒絕　華商銀行奉令對復地滙款特予優待</h3>
<p>自平準委員會對上海滙市訂定辦法後、雖各項步驟尙在分別施行之際、然其效力、已可對上海滙市金融各方面、收較爲良好之効果、據記者昨從可靠方面獲悉、安定上海滙市之各項措施、正在縝密推進、黑滙市塲、因平準會規定詳密、殊覺已無廻旋餘地、在相當時期、勢將完全趨於消沉、</p>
<p>美滙存款　已難移動</p>
<p>本市華商、旣因美國凍結資金之限制、復以平準會聯合本市十四家銀行嚴厲管理、所有美銀行美滙存戶、均巳無法移動、頗感不安、乃有設法四出兜售予非必需品不准申請結滙之進口商行、冀能在美商銀行劃　進口貨款、茲悉此種方法、美商各銀行已得有美官方之指示、一律不予劃帳、故華商在美銀行之美滙存戶、此種轉售劃　之企　、可謂巳歸泡影矣、</p>
<p>遊資內移　奉令優待</p>
<p>中國外滙平準基金委員會、與各友邦銀行及中中交農四行等、通力合作管理上海滙市、取締投機套滙消滅黑市後並由財政經濟兩部策動導引上海游資內移、以完成建國　用、今中中交農四行曁商業銀行、均巳奉令對於復地滙款、即由上海滙款柱後方各省市者、參照市塲情形、訂定適宜之辦法、獎勵資金之內移、如豁免滙費以及手續費等、同時對存入後方各省市行莊之款、利率予以提高、並由政府予以切實　障本息之安全、</p>
<p>滬行存款　减低利率</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海各行莊之國人存款、包括華商與外商銀行及錢莊、至民國二十九年底止、估計爲二十八萬五千萬元、比較二十六年戰事初發牛時、增加幾達一倍、惟定期存款僅佔百分之二一、而活期存款反佔百分之七九、各行莊鑒於存款之劇增、正常投資之途反感狹隘、爲减輕負担計、均相率减低定活期利率、活期儲蓄由五厘减爲一厘半、領用支票餘額在千元以下不計息、定期自八厘减爲七厘、一切優待辦法完全取消、外商各銀行對於國幣活期存款已不計息、</p>
<p>內地滙款　已見增加</p>
<p>各友邦銀行與四國家銀行通力合作之後、外匯黑市無形消滅、各投機塲所已失其依據、而國積貨物者、因必需品之進口、得依法申請固定之外滙、於是物價傾向低跌、此後不致再有波動、所以囤貨者、已受黑市外滙之消滅、而首先受到極大之影響、整個金融得以持久之安定、最近上海之游資、巳自然的內移、由銀行匯入內地款已增多、此實爲金融之好現象、同時國民政府所發之公債如統一等、買氣大盛、價格高漲、蓋一部游資入購買公債之途矣、</p>
<p>滬市日商　目光轉變</p>
<p>據日文上海每日新聞記載云、自平準會於本月八日起、停止供給黑市外滙、同時並規定公定價格、實施統制並管理外滙、故對於上海市塲及國際商品交易部門、實爲一大變革、平準會此决措置、實係與英美協力、在遠東對日本之經濟壓迫、以期遮斷利用上海作對海外之經濟活動、而使之窒息、平準會現已統制上海輸入、而對於輸出方面、亦將作同程度之範圍統制、故上海日商之活動範圍、將完全與海外市塲遮斷、故自美國凍結中日資金後、日本之貿易政策、即山從來之外貨獲得中義而轉移、是以今後日商方面之經濟活動範圍、祇有限於此項範圍內、另一方面、中外商人今後之活動、與日商完全相反、彼等之經營中樞、勢必須轉移於非淪陷區、而對外通路、亦必集中於香港、</p>

<h3>喬治李德爾訪美領　檢討租界行政</h3>
<p>銓衡諮詢委員行人選　西區損稅談判未結束</p>
<p>英國駐滬總領事喬治、偕工部局總董李德爾、曾於十日上午十一時、赴美國領事館、訪美總領事洛克赫德、長談達一小時之久、各方甚爲重視、據大中社記奢探悉、喬治與李德爾訪洛克赫德、係討論租界行政問題、組織諮詢委員會並銓衡該會人選、即爲就商問題之一、以工部局自本月三日開會決定徵收特別房捐後、必須微得諮詢委員會之同意、始能於明年起開微、</p>
<p>雙方催納　西區損稅</p>
<p>字林報云、據日大使館發言人堀氏昨（十二日）在招待新聞記者席上所稱、滬西界外馬路住戶、或須向工部局與市中心區雙方納稅、先是、某記者提出問話、言及虹橋路區居民、有遭雙方收稅員索取房捐與汽車照會費情事、日發言人乃闡明情勢稱、市中心區方面似相信其有資格微收各種捐稅、乃派人前往徵收、關於界外馬路之爭執、未曾解決、蓋雙方皆堅持有權在此區域收稅也、」故渠不知界外馬路區居民如何能避免向雙方納稅云云、</p>
<p>茲事交涉　仍在進行</p>
<p>某記者謂此等居民且已接不向市中心納稅、即不許使用其汽車之警吿、發言人答稱、汽車主不繳照會費、不准駛出、乃當然事耳、茲雙方談話、仍在進行、以圖解決此等問題云、據工部局某員稱、</p>
<p>將有三區　合用照會</p>
<p>關於西區捐稅等懸案將儘先解決三區合用汽車照會之建議、自工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥假畢返滬以來、雙方就西區捐稅等事進行之談判已獲進展云、訊者又以外傳捐稅談判之結果、可於下月書面決定說相叩、該某員聲稱、雙方會談、尙未達結束階段、故不能預料何時商妥云、按三區通用照會之計劃、車主不必分領公共租界、法租界與西區照會、祇須領有一張照會、即可通行於此三區、</p>

<h3>為貧苦小朋友　徵求破舊玩具</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>任何一個小朋友，一聽到「玩具」，沒有不表示歡迎的，不錯，玩具確是一件挺好玩的東西，它們會走，會跑，會叫，會跳，會動，會笑……，簡直和眞的東西模樣，而且比眞的東西還耍來得可愛，來得好玩。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，我想你們家裏一定有很多很可愛的玩具，況且你們的爸爸媽媽又是頂喜歡你們的，時常把陳列在大公司櫥窗裏的玩具買了回來，一等得你們自學校裏放了學回家之後，便給你們大大的玩一下，玩得你們眉開眼笑，心裏覺得快樂極了。你們的福氣眞好啊！可是你們那裹會知道，有不知多少貧苦的小朋友，站在那櫥窗前面，瞧着那些玩具在發呆，他們也和你們一樣的愛玩具，但是他們眞不幸，生在貧苦的家庭裹，速飯也沒有吃飽，那裹有餘踐來買玩具呢？他們只得站在櫉窗　面呆看着，然而他們的心裏，眞羨慕你們能有玩具，幷且有書讀。</p>
<p>當你們把舊玩具玩得厭了，或是壞了，便丟在壁角裹，而你們的爸爸媽媽更去買了一個新的，更好玩的來給你玩，你們的爸爸媽媽好極了，你們當用功讀書，來報答自己的爸爸媽媽才對。而一方面你們可曾想到那些沒有福氣玩玩具的貧苦小朋友？他們也是人家的孩子，連一隻舊玩具也沒有玩，你們覺得可憐嗎？那麼你們現在有一個很好的機會，就是把你們破舊的玩具來利用一下，也就是把這些破舊的玩具分給貧苦的小朋友，大家來玩玩，你們又想破舊的玩具有什麼好玩呢？那不要緊，現在有一家扶輪社玩具醫院，向親愛的小朋友們請求一些玩過了的玩具，不論舊的也好，破的也好，經過他們一番修理後，來分送給貧苦的小朋友，所以請你們趕快到牆壁角或牀底下去尋些破舊的玩具出來，請你們的爸爸媽媽派人送到福煦路六四〇號馬迪汽車公司，或是打電話一三〇一六號給馬伯樂君，他們便當派人前來領收，眞是非常的感激，並且親愛的小朋友們，你們又做了一件好事了！祝你們身體　健！玩具增多！</p>
<h3>莫辜負了扶植你們的人</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>至親愛的小朋友們！你們會知道嗎？我在羨慕着你們，讚美着你們呢！你們，你們，你們眞是天之驕子！你們，你們，你們眞是快樂之神！你們，你們……</p>
<p>你們是多麼的幸福，有得吃，有得穿，還有書讀。但是，你們有想到嗎？你們的爸爸，你們的媽媽，是怎樣地忙碌着工作，爲了你們的緣故。</p>
<p>尤其是目前，生活程度已經高達極度；米，煤球，房錢……那一件不是漲了又漲？在這樣的情况下，維持一家人的最低限度的生活，尙覺得非常因難，那裏還有力量給你們讀書呢？但是，你們的父母不願讓你們受到失學的痛苦，仍勉强送你們到學校裹去。要是你們再不曉得好好的用功，那未怎樣對得住你們的父母呢？</p>
<p>本報的讀者助學金運動，正也為了這個緣故。獲得的小朋友們！我不禁為你們慶幸，你們沒有被環境阻撓你們的前程，你們仍得繼續升學，成全你們的志向。你們的前途，依然是光明的。你們的將來，正有無窮的希望。但是，你們應當格外努力，以副本報與捐款諸君的殷殷之望。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！現在正是努力的開始，莫辜負了那些幫助你們，培植你們的人！</p>
<h3>蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 黎明</p>
<p>不是溫和的春天，也不是嚴寒的冬天，更不是炎熱的夏天，它是甚麼？就是凉爽的秋天。　秋天的氣候雖沒有冬天的寒冷，然而有許多樹木花草昆蟲等受不起霜的侵害，所以在沒有到冬天的時候早已躱着了。在這時不能够再聽見紡織娘金鈴子等叫聲，但是有蟋蟀來代替我們常在草堆裏，牆脚下，或花盆底下都可以找到。我們捉到了蟋蟀，養在盆裏玩，有時，大家揀出好的一齊放在盆子裏鬭。蟋蟀是好鬭的，所以兩隻蟋蟀遇到了，就相爭起來，總有一勝一負的，勝的就算是大王。</p>
<p>我們祇不過把鬭蟋蟀當着一種游戲；但是現在竟有人把蟋蟀做賭本，有些人因爲找不到最好的蟋蟀，常常出最高的代價買一隻蟋蟀，或派人到各地去尋找，他們所賭的數目，竟有至幾千元的。所以，秋天到了，一般人又興奮的養蟋蟀，與人家大決雌雄。但我們小朋友應記得，以蟋蟀作賭博，是萬萬要不得的。</p>
<h3>金甲蟲的夢</h3>
<p>— 樂悅</p>
<p>月姑娘趁着彎曲的小船，</p>
<p>在蔚藍的天海中浮盪。</p>
<p>一隻美麗的帶着金甲的小蟲，</p>
<p>正沉沉的墮入了甜蜜的夢鄉。</p>
<p>它夢見綠葉滿佈折濃蔭，</p>
<p>紅花散播着甜香，</p>
<p>它慢慢的從樹幹爬上了技頭，</p>
<p>去探視閃爍着的黃金似的陽光。</p>
<p>它又夢見纍纍的黃金之果，</p>
<p>正掛滿了一棵棵的樹上。</p>
<p>不論是大的小的，或甜或香，</p>
<p>都儘它吃了再吃，嘗了又嘗。</p>
<p>它還夢見皎潔的月明之夜，</p>
<p>當頑皮的孩子們都進了睡鄕，　它好伴着金鈴子，紡織娘，　奏着美妙的樂曲，多麼淸亮。</p>
<p>醒來時張眼叫望，</p>
<p>枯葉正掛在枝頭飄盪，西風吹來了寒冷；</p>
<p>白露帶來了凄凉。它眼看着枯禿的樹枝，</p>
<p>巳不是個安身的地方。只怪當初太愛受享，才落得結果這般模樣！</p>
<h3>芝麻的功用</h3>
<p>— 方方</p>
<p>小朋友們大概都知道芝麻是什麼東西。你們不是吃過芝蔴餅或者大餅的嗎？那小小的黏在餅上面的東西就是芝蔴；還有蔴油，那用芝蔴榨出來的油，放在小菜裏和放在湯裏都是很好的調味品。也許小朋友們還看見過種在田裏的芝蔴，那梗子是方的，葉子圓而尖，有光澤，到秋天便開出白色的花，結出的子有黑白兩種，就是黑芝蔴和白芝蔴。</p>
<p>芝蔴在我國，大都是用來榨油，除掉搾油之外，一部分是用來做食料，像我們常常吃的芝蔴餅，芝蔴糖，蔴酥糖等都是。</p>
<p>同時，在戰前它還是一種主要的出口農產品，每一年運到外洋去的很多，意大利，法國和日本都在大量的收買。日本買去做調味品，法國却買去做香水的原料；至於意大利，却是用我們的芝蔴來製造火藥。據說芝蔴裏面所合的油質很多，經過相當的熱度，爆發力是很大的，用來做燃燒爆發炸藥，比硫磺質的炸藥還要好呢別在髒的地方捉蟋蟀！　。倪長民製。</p>
<h3>日蝕</h3>
<p>— 熒亭</p>
<p>瑞兒在報上看到本月二十日中午將有日蝕的消息，心裏十分愉快，但他對這從未見過的日蝕，却不知道是怎麼一回事，於是跑去問他的父親。</p>
<p>「爸爸！日蝕是怎麼一回事，你可把它的原因吿訴我嗎？」「日蝕嗎？好！我來告訴你。」他父親就在室內拿出地球儀洋燭和一面圓鏡來，先把地球儀和洋燭放在桌子的左右兩方，然後對瑞兒說：</p>
<p>「上古時代的人，把目然界的風雨雷電，看做變幻莫測的神秘現象，以爲神靈在發怒揚威，這在智識幼稚的古代，是不足爲奇的，他們以爲日蝕是太陽遭到了厄運，是件很不幸的事；但是到了這科學昌明的二十世紀，那些無糟的迷信，巳被科學家和天文家一一打破了。」這時，他就把燃着了洋燭接着又說：「今天我就把洋燭來當做太陽，圓鏡當做月亮，地球儀仍當作地球」說時就把圓鏡挿在洋燭和地球儀的中問，便問瑞兒道：「現在你看見了日蝕嗎？瑞兒仰頭望了望天空，木鷄似的怔住了：他眼見烈日高張，暑氣逼人，心想那裏來的日蝕呢？他父親知道他還沒有明白，於是指着桌子上的東西說：「你看這就是日蝕時的情形啦！如果這時我們在地球上遙向宇宙　望去，你想能看到整個的太陽嗎？」瑞兒想了一想，微笑着說：「是太陽　光被月亮擋住的原因嗎？」父親點着頭說：「對啊！現在你該明白了，當月亮走在太陽和地球之間，成一直綫的時候，是會形成日蝕的；同時因爲它們都在迅速地旋轉，所以地位就在時刻移動着，因此日蝕的時間就很短促了。</p>
<p>「爸爸！這决該有多少時候呢？」瑞兒高興地問着。</p>
<p>「二百零二秒啊二合計起來只有三分廿二秒的時間哩！」</p>
<p>「爸爸！日蝕的原理是被誰發見的？」他仍不絕地問着。</p>
<p>「這是公元前五百多年，一個希臘著名的天文　家泰理斯發見的。</p>
<p>「爸爸！他……」瑞兒還在繼續地發問，忽聞他媽媽的喚聲，叫他們去吃午飯，於是把他們的話打斷了。</p>
<h3>不知自量的老蛙</h3>
<p>— 葉斐</p>
<p>有一隻老蛙站在池塘裏的浮萍上休息，忽然他的兒子忽忽忙忙奔過來對他說道：</p>
<p>「媽媽，那邊有一隻龐大的牛，很大很大！」</p>
<p>「有多少大？」老蛙問。</p>
<p>「很大很大！」</p>
<p>老蛙聽罷，便喝飽了水，把肚子漲得很大，比原來的大了一倍，問小蛙道：「有我這樣大嗎？」</p>
<p>「比你大！」小蛙答。</p>
<p>老蛙又喝了些水問道：「這樣如何？」</p>
<p>還比你大！</p>
<p>老蛙又喝了些水：「這樣呢？」</p>
<p>「還比你大！」</p>
<p>老蛙氣極了，於是儘量地喝，喝得不能冉喝爲止。</p>
<p>「道樣……話還沒有說完，拍的一聲，它的肚皮爆裂了</p>
<p>小朋友，你們看了上面一段故事，有何感想？</p>

<p>卑人曾在各電臺中播唱平劇，有四五年之久，故對於播音之種種，方法及秩序，有少許心得。尤其遇特別節目之名票名伶大會唱，人數旣多，秩序極難維持，秩序一亂，一切慌促，節目遂失精彩，此乃常見之現象。、木月十日，鴻翔公司，宣傳營業之大播音，大美電臺爲播送平劇部分，海上名票名伶，網雜殆盡，卑人亦被友人拉去，對着空氣，唱桑園寄子，「嘆兄弟」，「見墳臺」兩段。曾心齋金少剛二君，一打鼓，一操琴，皆稱票友中文武塲好手。滑稽家張冶兒君之報吿，尤特別賣力，我的唱不免脫了工夫，有一句或可聽聽，有一句忽然力不從心，自己覺着沒唱好。加以播音室中烏烟瘴氣看的人擠得風雨不透，並且有人在旁邊說說笑笑，有時竟把播音機頭碰得顫巍巍有要掉下地來休息一下的樣子。室中的地方，本來不大，被許多人們塡滿了十個鐘頭，裏而熱得似乎可以蒸熟了雞蛋，人一進去，就感覺呼吸困難，其　唱得舒服者鮮矣。我受了公司方面及辦事朋友的優待，絕非不滿意而寫此文譏諷，我因爲每回大播音，尤其是平劇，就有此種種現象，每回如此混亂，每人都感不適，所以我今貢敝點意見，於以後大播平劇的各方面；凡大播平劇之前，劇務主任及各組主仟，密切注意，播音人數不在多，某人播唱時間，務必準確。先後次序，不可移易，雖非絕對，亦係相對。播音室中，除執事人，塲面人，當時播音人外，絕對謝絕參觀，報吿人宜少說話，宜傳的句子，亦宜隔一刻或一十分鐘說一次。更要擊者，某一票房，或某一小集團，應請其合唱對兒戲或擊戲塲，則趣味多而時間省矣。或問：時間何以能辦到準確？我謂：那得用車子去接，團體則用大卡車，亦不妨也。屆時再去接到後少停即唱，則自己用爾腿早去者自少。或曰：如此車費豈不甚大？我說：票友練戲一年，兩年，十年，二十年，甚全有四十年之　騐，　不為人農吿而設，雖費汽油，似亦不傷廉也。</p>

<h3>US Defense Zone Scope Includes All Oceans, President's Speech is Practically a Limited Declaration of War, 300 Warships Commence Search and Fire</h3>
<p>Washington, 13th (Associated Press) - Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Germany's actions will determine the actual scope of US naval operations. Hull also stated that the area in which the US Navy operates will include any location deemed a threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere. Germany's actions will inevitably determine how much the US Navy will expand its patrol range. He further stated that the Axis powers are currently attempting to conquer land and sea by force as quickly and effectively as possible. Hull generally agreed with a reporter's observation that there were no directly established so-called blockade zones or self-defense zones between the US and Germany. He also stated that the current situation is the result of numerous speeches and announcements and contains no specific phrases regarding defense zones. Hull said that the general public is now paying attention to the US attempt to establish a defense base in Labrador, but he did not elaborate on this matter. Hull further stated that there was no need to notify the German government of President Roosevelt's speech.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (Reuters) - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that Germany's behavior would determine what areas of the ocean the US considers defensive, and within which areas US ships could fire first. When a reporter asked him to define "defensive ocean," Hull replied, "We must not forget that the United States is currently facing a worldwide violent action aimed at conquering all continents and oceans. This resistance will necessarily express what ocean areas the United States can deem must be defended in order to protect the Western Hemisphere." The reporter then asked if the United States would formally send a note to Germany protesting the attacks on American ships. Hull replied, "Please refer to the President's speech."</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (International News Service) - Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference today, releasing Roosevelt's declaration, that the President recently announced US policy, stating that US ships have been ordered to fire first if they encounter Axis submarines or other warships. This statement by the President applies not only to the American side of the Atlantic, but also to all parts of the seven seas where German and Italian warships threaten American interests. However, when explaining the all-inclusive "fire first" order, Hull, like President Roosevelt, did not mention Japan or Japanese warships. Foreign diplomatic circles here generally believe that the President's recent actions constitute a de facto declaration of war by the United States in the Atlantic. It is reported that the US Navy has already received new orders to set out on patrol to implement the "fire first" declaration. Officials say the next step, regarding the issue of war and peace between Hitler and the United States, now depends on Hitler.</p>
<p>New York, 13th (Reuters) - A dispatch from Washington elaborates on Hull's remarks to reporters yesterday regarding the "fire first" order, saying that while Hull's words were obscure, their meaning was clear: it was a warning to Berlin that if a ship flying the American flag is attacked anywhere on Earth, there will be a possibility of American retaliation. In practical terms, Hull's remarks have made all navigable oceans in the world part of the US defense zone.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. Early, told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt's clear speech was the only definition of the areas within which the US can fire first. After the speech was broadcast, the White House received a total of 1,600 telegrams, all but 150 of which supported the President's position. According to radio station surveys, the broadcast had a very large audience, estimated at 80 million people, accounting for 67% of the listening audience, only 3% less than when the President announced an unlimited state of emergency in early summer. Therefore, this can be said to be the second-largest audience in American listening history. When asked about the President's statement that ships of Britain and other friendly nations on legitimate voyages will be protected by US ships within the American defense zone, Mr. Early replied that everyone knows the meaning of "protection," even a schoolchild with a slight knowledge of English knows it.</p>
<p>New York, 13th (Reuters) - A dispatch from the New York Sun in Washington states that the US President's speech is seen by the world as almost a limited declaration of war. What Hitler's response will be is what people in Washington were waiting for yesterday.</p>
<p>Washington, 13th (Associated Press) - The US Navy's Atlantic Patrol Force yesterday conducted its first test of its "fire first" search, to search for the submarine that sank the freighter Montana in the North Atlantic. Army units have been cooperating with the Navy from their bases in Iceland, but the majority of the responsibility for defending the area will be borne by the Atlantic Fleet. In the past June, the Atlantic Fleet received a large increase in defenses from the Pacific. The area may still need to be further fortified.</p>
<p>Washington, 12th - International affairs commentators expressed their opinions tonight, believing that the American people and Congress will support any future actions by the President, because society and sentiment have responded to the President's actions better and faster than they have to his speeches. Leading members of Congress generally agreed with the President's speech and unanimously considered the speech to be tantamount to a declaration of war. Senator Connally said that he hopes the US Navy will fire fiercely and resolutely deal with attacking ships. Editorials in major newspapers all supported the policy announced by the President, urging the government to continue taking strong measures and calling on the American people to support the President.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Associated Press) - The London Evening News predicted yesterday that as a result of President Roosevelt's speech on freedom of the seas, Germany will be forced to back down, allowing American raw materials to flow across the Atlantic, or face a shooting war with the United States. The Standard Evening News published a dispatch from Washington, reporting that 300 American warships have begun searching for German raiders in the Atlantic. The newspaper said that the second decision is in Hitler's hands. He has encountered the greatest hesitation in the war so far. If he does not withdraw from the waters west of Iceland, he will invite a shooting war with the United States. But regardless of what he does, he has suffered a major defeat today. British officials say that there is no doubt that President Roosevelt has obtained the powers of commander-in-chief of the US Army and Navy. In addition, it is clear that US ships and aircraft will seek out and destroy every German ship found in the self-defense zone.</p>
<p>London, 13th (International News Service) - British authorities commenting on President Roosevelt's speech said that Mr. Roosevelt has drawn a line in the center of the Atlantic Ocean. The United States has now assumed responsibility for protecting all ships west of Iceland in the Atlantic, while Britain is responsible for those to the east. It is widely believed that if Germany tries to undermine the security of the western sea lanes, it will risk "war" with the United States. British Prime Minister Churchill will soon issue a formal statement on Roosevelt's speech on behalf of the British government.</p>
<p>Moscow, 13th (Associated Press) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhailovsky said yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech on freedom of the seas has dealt Germany the most serious blow, and not only in its political significance.</p>
<h3>German Official Statement</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - German officials strongly condemned President Roosevelt for fabricating facts in his speech, deliberately placing the United States in the position of defender in order to wage war against the Axis powers. His claim that four American ships and one Panamanian ship had been attacked is completely untrue. He now openly admits that he has ordered the US fleet to attack any Axis ships when necessary. This move will force Germany to take all necessary steps. Mr. Roosevelt, in his speech yesterday, made it clear to the world that US President Roosevelt should bear full responsibility for all consequences. The German Foreign Ministry continued, "Roosevelt is the mastermind behind this European war. Various documents that have been published show what kind of activities he and his followers participated in for two years before and after the outbreak of the war. He intended to cause the outbreak of the European war when he supported Czechoslovakia. He and his special envoy to Belgrade, Colonel Donovan, also tried every possible means to bring Yugoslavia into the war. He also tried to force defeated France to continue its anti-German war with a policy of starvation blockade. The Anglo-Soviet alliance was also created by him. He is a war maniac who wants to blur the feelings of the American people in order to send them to the front lines. But when the American people taste the pain of war and realize it, it will be too late to regret it." Berlin officials continued, "Roosevelt's policy fully reflects the style of a representative of the Communist Jewish race. The reason is none other than that the Jewish race has already been eliminated in this war. We still remember that when he was running for president, he repeatedly stated that he would not involve the United States in the vortex of war, but today none of his policies fail to draw the American people into the disaster of war, becoming cannon fodder to maintain the interests of Britain and the Jews. The purpose of this speech is nothing more than to make the American people believe that he is standing in the position of defender, so he is forced to take steps to protect American interests. These several events were all created by him in order to provide an excuse for joining the war." The German Foreign Ministry believes that Roosevelt's explanation of the Greer incident is completely inconsistent with the facts and has been proven by previously published German communiques. As for the second incident, in which an American warship was chased by a German submarine, the German government has never heard of it. Regarding the Robin Moor incident mentioned by Roosevelt, the treatment of the ship and its crew was entirely in accordance with universally recognized laws of war and there was nothing illegal about it. As for the Steel Seafarer incident, since Germany and Italy had clearly announced a combat zone in advance, and according to the statement issued by the United States, the ship was also carrying munitions, but the ship still rashly entered the combat zone, so it is difficult to blame others for its misfortune. As for whether there were American ships among the ships sunk in the Suez Canal area, the German side could not be sure because the attacks took place at night. As for the Sessa, since it was flying the Panamanian flag, the US President has no right to inquire about its loss. In short, President Roosevelt's entire speech is completely arbitrary and disregards the facts in its main parts. Its purpose is clearly to show that such events are all planned actions by Germany against American warships and merchant ships. The order issued by the US President to shoot Axis ships, judging from the previous speech by US Secretary of the Navy Knox, has already taken effect months ago, but Mr. Roosevelt thought that the time was not yet ripe and did not dare to admit it clearly. Now he thinks the time has come. The people of the world know that the Axis powers have no aggressive ambitions, so Mr. Roosevelt has to fabricate facts." A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry solemnly stated in conclusion that after the US fleet receives the order to shoot Axis ships, it will force Germany to take all necessary steps. The consequences resulting from this should be borne by President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency) - Responsible parties recently commented that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech is completely contrary to American neutrality. So far, the United States has not formally abandoned its neutrality in legal terms. As for Roosevelt's decision to occupy military strategic points outside American territorial waters and beyond its interests, it is also completely contrary to the Monroe Doctrine championed by the United States. Roosevelt is using some accidental events to order the fleet to shoot all ships of the Axis countries. His desire to make a mountain out of a molehill is very obvious. His purpose is to promote American participation in the war. The so-called freedom of the seas has little meaning and only wants to maintain the maritime hegemony of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<h3>Active Trading on the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>New York, 12th (Associated Press) - Market analysts continued to express their belief today that the stock market is trending upward, but experts believe that the current situation is a market full of stocks, not a stock market. Experts' words mean that stock trading is currently selective buying and selling. Wall Street believes that President Roosevelt's speech is constructive for the stock market. The market opened stably and trading was active. Cotton advanced 13 to 20 points. Prices fluctuated slightly at the close, but all made progress because the market believes that President Roosevelt's speech is favorable. Wall Street believes that the President's remarks have clarified the ambiguous status of US transport on the high seas. It also believes that the President's failure to mention Japan is enough to indicate that the government hopes to reach a satisfactory resolution on US-Japan differences. Bonds fluctuated today. Chicago grains closed slightly lower.</p>
<h3>US Policy Toward the Far East Has Not Changed in Five Years, Considers Talk of Compromise With Japan Strange</h3>
<p>Washington, 13th (Reuters) - The optimism expressed in dispatches from Shanghai and Tokyo, believing that US-Japan relations are now gradually entering a stage of close friendship, replacing the increasing tension of the past fifteen months, has not been seen as having a basis in Washington. As far as informed sources know, the US position has not changed. It is reported that Japan now understands that Japan must first provide genuine and concrete evidence of a change in mindset and sincerity before practical talks can be held to eliminate the current tension between the two countries. According to opinions here, Washington cannot be convinced of Japan's sincerity in improving relations with the United States unless Japan withdraws from the Axis. This does not mean that the United States is willing to make concessions or lift the recent economic sanctions imposed on Japan in exchange for Japan's withdrawal from the Axis. Some quarters believe that US authorities hold a sense that certain important gestures, such as withdrawing from the Axis, are necessary to ensure that the US government has assurance that Japan truly wants to improve US-Japan relations. As for speculations that if Japan makes such a gesture, a policy of appeasement will be adopted or China will be sold out, there is no evidence here to indicate this. In fact, US policy toward the Far East has not changed to this day and is still based on the declaration issued by the United States after Japan's invasion of China in 1937. In other words, while Japan is trapped in the quagmire of war against China, it rashly led to a predicament of almost going to war with Britain and the United States. Now, if it wishes to get out of this predicament, withdrawing from the Axis is only the first step. The news coming from Shanghai, which seems to say that the US and Japan are about to reach a large-scale compromise, is considered strange here. However, the optimism of the Japanese transmitted from Tokyo and the news that Japanese newspapers are temporarily not criticizing the United States have aroused interest, and particular attention is being paid to the privately transmitted saying that even the pro-war factions and military cliques in Tokyo are now feeling panic and are thinking of withdrawing from the Axis in order to avoid the continued deterioration of relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Havas News Agency) - According to informed sources, US-Japanese negotiations have reached a preliminary agreement last week, the contents of which are expected to be released within days. However, the form in which it will be released is unknown. What can be known is that this agreement should declare that the US and Japan agree to handle relations between the two countries in accordance with various basic principles. As for the solution to various pending cases, it is not involved. In essence, this agreement is intended to stipulate that the two countries guarantee not to resort to arms in the future and should find ways to peacefully resolve various political issues between them in order to gradually restore normal economic and financial relations.</p>
<h3>Chinese Officials and People Adhere to Their Position</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 13th (Reuters) - Although most Chinese here do not fully believe the rumors that the terms of a US-Japan agreement have been decided as a result of discussions in Washington, a sense of anxiety is gradually growing. It is widely believed that these talks may have progressed beyond the "probing stage." All Chinese leaders believe that the above-mentioned rumors that the terms of the agreement have been decided may have been spread by the Japanese side. Although they are by no means the final conditions of a settlement, they may more or less represent the Japanese side's proposals. They do not believe that the United States will sacrifice China to appease Japan without consulting China and immediately accept the final settlement conditions, or accept conditions that it knows China cannot allow. Chinese officials and the public all insist that China will continue to resist as long as Japanese troops do not withdraw from Chinese territory. According to reliable Chinese sources received here from Washington, the United States is eager to reach a compromise with Japan in order to devote its full strength to dealing with developments in the Atlantic. However, some Chinese people do not believe that the United States' position in the Atlantic will make it necessary for it to appease Japan, because the United States does not need to use its main naval force to deal with German raiders and warships in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - Diplomatic circles believe that US Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy's meeting with French Head of State Pétain yesterday is directly related to the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Kato and French Deputy Premier Darlan. It is reported that Leahy informed Pétain that clashes between the US and Japan in the Far East are inevitable. It is said that Leahy discussed the issue of Vietnam with Pétain and informed Pétain that if Japan increases its garrison in Vietnam, Britain and the United States will be forced to take certain countermeasures.</p>
<h3>NAKANO’s Speech Has Two Intents</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) - Seigo Nakano, leader of the only revival party in Japan, the Oriental Society, gave a speech here this afternoon in response to British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt. Thousands of Tokyo citizens listened, and thousands more stood outside the lecture hall, listening through loudspeakers. Nakano predicted that the US-Japan war will break out soon. He did not have much faith in the opportunity for a settlement between Britain, the United States, and Japan, and said that if negotiations fail, Japan is prepared to fight to the last man. Nakano also warned in his speech, which was not officially authorized but must have been approved, not to prolong the Washington talks, lest Japan lose the opportunity to advance south. Nakano continued, oil is the urgently needed blood for Japan in transfusions, and warned that the time may come when this blood cannot be obtained. At that time, our planes will all be parked on the ground and unable to rise. The United States is now solely occupied with assisting Britain, so fighting with Japan will be "meaningless". If Japan sends its 500 warships and 4,000 aircraft to the South Pacific to threaten Singapore, Manila, and Australia, Britain and the United States will be difficult to deal with. Therefore, he urged the Axis countries to take the offensive via the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf and meet with Japan in Singapore. Most of the evening newspapers did not publish this speech in a prominent position. Only the Sino-Foreign Business News was published on the front page. It was not mentioned in the scheduled news program of TOAK Radio. Foreign observers in Tokyo all believe that Nakano's speech had only two intentions: (1) to test the public's mood towards the US-Japan situation, (2) to urge the United States to quickly comply with Japan's proposals. Among the morning newspapers, only the Kokumin Shinbun published this speech on the front page, saying that the purpose of this speech was probably aimed specifically at foreigners. Although the general public only considered Nakano's speech to be an opinion expressed by a powerful and minority party leader and did not pay much attention to it, in today's tense situation when others are trying to be cautious and silent, expressing such bold remarks is not without considerable significance. At the same time, general pessimism is now growing again.</p>
<h3>Continued Reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Associated Press) - The Cabinet continued its rapid reorganization yesterday. Observers believe that the purpose of this move is to respond to the German-Soviet war and to deal with "changes in the world situation" in order to satisfy public antipathy. Officials said, "The aim of the Army Department's transfer is to ensure close cooperation between the Army Chief and Tokyo policy in order to be more loyal to the Emperor." Observers also said that even right-wing figures can cooperate with any new Konoe policy, and right-wing leaders are currently in the hands of conservative elements.</p>
<h3>Philippine Journalist Romulo Arrives in Chongqing From Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Philippine newspaper giant Carlos P. Romulo arrived in Hong Kong from Manila the day before yesterday and arrived in Chongqing this morning. After a short rest, he went to the Executive Yuan to meet with Secretary-General Jiang Tingfu. Mr. Romulo will stay in Chongqing for four or five days and plans to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Romulo had visited Chiang the day before the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, and was the first foreign reporter to learn that China was determined to resist if Japan challenged it, and reported this to the United States accurately. In addition, Mr. Romulo will also visit government authorities and leaders from all walks of life, and then collect reports from Kunming, Yangon, Singapore, Batavia, and other places. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Retreat From Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Associated Press) - Two hundred Japanese nationals evacuated from Sydney, Brisbane, New Gold Mountain, and Davos have arrived in Kobe, and 160 Japanese nationals evacuated from Malaya have also arrived in Moji today.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From the Atlantic Situation to Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Since the 7th of last month, there have been no fewer than five or six instances of American ships being deliberately attacked by German submarines and aircraft. Apart from two American warships that escaped damage despite being attacked, three merchant ships flying the American flag have been sunk. The latest, the "Montana," was attacked just hours after President Roosevelt delivered a tough speech announcing a "shoot on sight" policy. It is not difficult to imagine that German ships and aircraft will intensify their attacks on American ships in all seas from now on, while the American naval and air forces will also intensify their search and strike back hard, following the President's orders. Under these circumstances, the tense situation in the Atlantic naturally contains a major crisis that could erupt at any moment. Although the United States may not immediately declare war on Germany, the extreme seriousness of the situation is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The deterioration of U.S.-German relations has not been a matter of a day or two. How it will evolve in the future is as clear as watching a fire, and it seems unnecessary to speculate further. What is worth examining is why Germany, not sooner or later, suddenly changed its strategy of avoiding provoking the United States since the beginning of the war, especially at a time when rumors were rife that the U.S. and Japan were about to reach a compromise, and openly attacked its ships while admitting it without hesitation, as if it had decided to force the United States to join the war. Generally speaking, the change in Germany's attitude toward the United States may be due to the following reasons: First, the Nazi war against the Soviet Union has been prolonged and must be dragged through the winter. In view of Britain's recent advances in Africa and the Near East, and the small-scale offensive by the British-Canadian joint forces in northern Norway a few days ago, Hitler seems to be worried that if Britain launches a counter-offensive early, the Axis powers will be attacked from both sides. Therefore, he would rather risk offending the United States and is determined to do everything possible to prevent Britain from receiving supplies from across the Atlantic. Second, Hitler knows that sooner or later he will break with the United States. Rather than waiting for the Roosevelt government to use its vast material and human resources to complete the entire national defense program, it is better to force it to join the war early. Moreover, at a time when there is no concrete achievement in the U.S.-Japan negotiations, inviting the United States to join the war can at least force Roosevelt not to transfer all the naval and air forces in the Pacific to the Atlantic to fight against Germany. Third, the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations, no matter to what extent the two sides can reach a compromise, are more or less unfavorable to Germany. Assuming that Japan really abandons the Axis powers in the future and joins the embrace of Britain and the United States, it would be almost a fatal blow to Hitler's already considerably shaken prestige. Therefore, he must "win by surprise" and make a gesture of breaking with the United States in order to "hold on" to Japan and encourage Japan not to abandon the policy of "taking advantage of the Axis's momentum to establish hegemony in the Pacific." At the very least, Hitler hopes to "threaten the United States in the Atlantic" to raise Japan's bargaining position in negotiations with the United States, so that the isolated Tokyo government will not accept the conditions of Britain and the United States one hundred percent. This is not only a very subtle "bitter trick," but also a "reassurance pill" to comfort a group of pro-German elements in Japan. Because after the German-Soviet war, the public opinion in Japan complaining about the Tripartite Pact and the sentiment of doubting whether the Axis powers can win have indeed gradually risen. Hitler knows that if there is no practical action to convince Japan at this time, he will lose this "more than failing, failing more" Eastern ally.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that Germany's repeated attacks on American ships in the Atlantic and the Red Sea are indeed related to the long-running U.S.-Japan negotiations, although the U.S.-Japan negotiations themselves, as of now, are still confusing and difficult to grasp what stage they have reached. Tokyo's propaganda says that the progress is smooth, that is, the two sides have reached an agreement in principle, but the fact that President Roosevelt did not mention a word in his speech the next day shows that the claim of reaching an agreement is absolutely unreliable. Moreover, the Japanese side claimed to have reached an agreement at the end of last week (September 6), but Secretary of State Hull said on Thursday of this week (September 12) that the U.S.-Japan talks "have not had any new developments." Given the frank and fair attitude of Roosevelt and Hull in normal times, there is no reason why the negotiations were completed a week ago, but they are still concealing it. Although President Roosevelt sternly condemned Germany yesterday, he did not criticize Japan at the same time like British Prime Minister Churchill, which seems to contain some consideration for Japan. But on the one hand, this may be the "courtesy" that a head of state should have when the two sides' talks are in progress, and on the other hand, the sole object of yesterday's speech was to respond to Germany's piratical behavior, and not to discuss the general international situation. He did not mention a word about the Soviet war, which is clear evidence. Therefore, regarding what progress has been made in the U.S.-Japan talks recently, the world may as well wait for the official explanation from the Washington authorities under the belief that the United States will never abandon the eight principles and will never change its anti-aggression policy, and there is no need to be disturbed by some rumors. It should be known that no matter what new developments there are in U.S.-Japan relations, the essence of which remains unchanged. At least one fact has been determined and unshakeable, that is, the comprehensive strength of the democratic group in the Far East will inevitably become stronger and stronger in the future. Therefore, no matter what, it must be entirely beneficial and harmless to China, which upholds justice.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Represents Chairman Chiang at a Banquet to Bid Farewell to the U.S. Military Delegation. China's Operations are Not Without Benefit to the United States. The Two Countries Will Surely Cooperate to Guarantee Peace in the Pacific. The Delegation is Requesting Instructions from the Government to Come to China in the Short Term.</h3>
<p>Washington – Song Ziwen, representing Chairman Chiang, hosted a banquet tonight at the Shoreham Hotel to bid farewell to members of the U.S. military delegation to China and its leader, Major General Magruder. The delegation is currently making final requests for instructions from the government in order to go to China in the short term. Mr. Song, on behalf of Chairman Chiang, expressed his welcome to the delegation's visit to China, saying roughly: It is not the first time that a foreign military delegation has visited China. In 1925, the Soviet military delegation visited China, and a few years later, Germany also sent a military delegation to China. The delegations of the Soviet Union and Germany have made considerable contributions to China's national defense. The Chinese people's firm and unshakable belief in friendship with the United States exceeds their belief in friendship with any other country. It is not strange for your people to help our country, and it is an honor for your country. Secondly, when our national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, founded the Republic of China, he took the United States of America as an example. Today, our country still needs to review the ways and steps to establish democracy from your country. Now the democratic foundation of our country has been established, because the people of our country originally have a democratic consciousness in their nature. No matter how humble the people of our country are, they must have an innate sense of self-esteem. Anyone who resides in our country can understand this point. Self-esteem originates from a belief that everyone is in an equal position. This is exactly the opposite of the Japanese, whose aggressive nature is enough to reflect their inferiority complex. Third, we often hear in our spare time (the United States and China on the other side of the Pacific should join hands), but in fact, our country's more than four years of resolute anti-aggression struggle is not without value to your country, which is well known by all parties. In the past, our country was generally imagined as an old and defenseless country. We are witnessing the production of a great country that loves peace, seeks peace, and defends its interests with force. I firmly believe that the future era will surely witness China and the United States adopting cooperation in a very harmonious way to jointly guarantee the peaceful development of the Pacific region. I respectfully hope that after your hard work in our country in the future, you will be able to truly understand the above points, as an encouragement to you and make you feel comforted.

<h3>A Chinese Military Officer Talks About the Process of Recapturing Fuzhou. The Chinese Army Fought Heroically with the Determination to Avenge its Shame. It Gained the Assistance of People from All Over and Achieved Initial Success.</h3>
<p>Shangrao - Fuzhou City is the second provincial capital recovered by the Chinese army after Nanning City. The county town is good news after the war has entered its fifth year, which is enough to make the people of the country happy and encouraged. In order to understand the details of the battle, the reporter went to a certain place to visit the military officer in charge, who answered as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Counterattack</p>
<p>(1) Question: What was the motivation of the Chinese army to capture Fuzhou and what was the military situation before the launch? Answer: The Chinese army was determined to recover Fuzhou in order to relieve the people from their plight. Moreover, Fuzhou is isolated in terms of terrain, and the Japanese soldiers are not sufficiently allocated in terms of equipment. After the Chinese military command decided to recover Fuzhou, it made preparations in advance. On the 1st of this month, it launched a real attack. The main force of the Chinese army was controlled in the front of Fuzhou, waiting for an opportunity to move. The two wings attacked from Fuqing, Changle, and Lianjiang, Guantou, respectively, to control Fuzhou City and cut off the north-south sea lanes at the mouth of the Minjiang River. When the attacks on the two wings of the Chinese army were effective, the rear of the Japanese army in Fuzhou felt threatened. Therefore, the main force on the front took advantage of the situation to launch a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Overview of the Bloody Battle</p>
<p>(2) Question: How did the Chinese army win a complete victory in recovering Fuzhou, what were the details of the battle? Answer: After the Chinese army decided to recover Fuzhou, all three routes began to move. The target of the Chinese army on the right bank of the Minjiang River was Fuqing City. After dusk on August 25, they attacked the North Gate and Haikou of Fuqing in separate directions. Before dawn on the 26th, they captured Fuqing City. The Japanese army retreated to Haikou. On the evening of the 27th, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements from Haikou launched a fierce counterattack under the cover of Japanese aircraft. Fuqing was captured by the Japanese again. On September 1, the Chinese army launched another attack and added its main force. The morale was high and unstoppable. The Japanese army was unable to support and fled. The Chinese army recaptured Fuqing City on the 2nd and pursued and defeated the Japanese army. In the evening, they captured Haikou again. The Japanese army escaped by boat from Haikou. Another part of the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and recover Changle City. Thus, the Japanese army on the right bank of the Minjiang River was wiped out. On the left bank of the Minjiang River, Lianjiang, the Chinese army's attacking troops attacked Sangang Mishi on the evening of August 25, and a part attacked Pandu. That night, they occupied Sangang. Then the Japanese army reinforced with hundreds of counterattacks. The Chinese army retreated to the vicinity of Pukou and Mupu, and turned to attack Lianjiang. On the morning of the 26th, they occupied Yuntai Mountain. The Japanese army felt embarrassed and used fierce artillery fire to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. In order to contain and lure the Japanese army, the Chinese army transferred to the vicinity of Xiayang via Pukou on the 30th and continued to make small-scale contact with the Japanese army in Pandu. On September 1, the real attack of the Chinese army began. The main force joined the battle and attacked Lianjiang. A part attacked Pandu from Liaoyang and advanced. After a fierce battle with the Japanese army, they occupied Pandu. They continued to attack Tangling Jianghu and took advantage of the victory to attack Lianjiang City. The Japanese army retreated to Zhongyan Mountain and Jiangnan Bridge in separate directions. Then seven or eight hundred Japanese troops from Guantou, with many artillery pieces, reinforced Jiangnan Bridge and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army under the cover of aircraft, trying to maintain this important rear base. The battle was fierce. The Japanese army re-offended Lianjiang City. That night, the Chinese army's reserve team joined the battle. The morale was greatly boosted and they attacked Lianjiang City again. After a fierce battle, they finally recaptured Lianjiang City on the morning of the 3rd and captured several Japanese artillery pieces and many other war trophies. The Chinese army also pursued and occupied the important point of Guantou. The north road of the Minjiang River, which went to sea from Fuzhou, was controlled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army escaped by boat from Changmen. On the Fuzhou side, a part of the Chinese army advanced from Baishaguan Yuanli on the evening of the 25th, occupied Nanxi Mountain on the morning of the 26th, and occupied the line of Shijiaoshan Dabao Peak on the morning of the 27th. They continued to force the Japanese army's positions in Dalanshan and Tongcen. On the 29th, they secretly advanced a part of the main force to await the good news of the Chinese army's attack on Fuqing and Lianjiang, and then pushed forward with all their strength to Fuzhou. They once raided Centou at night, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. After the 30th, Japanese aircraft dispatched to stop the Chinese army's attack, but it seemed that the main force in this area was not discovered by the Japanese army. They sneaked into Fuzhou City and the areas near Nantai on the same day. With the help of the people, they actively disrupted and destroyed the Japanese army. The Japanese army hurriedly transferred the Qingchuan Brigade of the Marine Corps to Fuzhou via Nantai for reinforcement. At dawn on the 1st, the Chinese army secretly prepared the brave main force for three or four days and suddenly attacked Tongkou and Bijia Mountain, the important points on the outer edge of Fuzhou. This line was the main defense line of the Japanese army. The battle was fierce. On the morning of the 2nd, another part of the Chinese army joined the battle and finally defeated the Japanese army. They captured Tongkou on the night of the 2nd and occupied Nainaiping, Hudingshan, and Centou on the morning of the 3rd. By this time, the main defense line of the Japanese army entrenched in Fuzhou had fallen into the hands of the Chinese army. The attacks by the Chinese army in Fuqing, Changle, and Lianjiang were also very successful. The rear situation of the Japanese army was quite critical. The Japanese army in Fuzhou was showing signs of wavering. The Chinese attacking troops took advantage of the situation to step up their attack. The South Road captured Hongshan Bridge, turned around and advanced, and rushed into Jiangbianjiao via Hongshan Bridge, Fuzhou Nantai, and Dujia Island. The North Road Chinese army quickly pursued the main force of the Japanese army from Beitou, Xiaodian, and Fuzhou to Mawei. A part surrounded and attacked Fuzhou City. Under the Chinese army's pincer attack, the Japanese army lost its advance and retreat and retreated one after another. At 8 am on the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army officially recovered Fuzhou City and occupied Nantai outside the city at 10 am. The Japanese army, covering the retreating troops, entrenched themselves in the Gulingshan area to resist. The Chinese army, with the remaining power of victory, fought fiercely for a day. The Japanese army on Gulingshan retreated to Mawei until the evening. The Chinese army's pursuing troops tracked and searched, and completely wiped out the Japanese army in Mawei on the morning of the 4th. In this battle, the competition for Fuqing, Lianjiang, and Tongkou was fierce, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Reasons for Victory</p>
<p>(3) Question: What are the reasons for the Chinese army's victory? Answer: (1) The Japanese army was entrenched in Fuzhou and its situation was isolated. Because after the Japanese army occupied Fuzhou, it was under the control of the Chinese army. The line from Fuqing Tongkou, Daxiao Beiyan to Lianjiang could not be expanded. The strength of its outer defense line was not enough to allocate. It was extremely difficult to defend it. (2) The commanders at all levels of the Chinese army were determined to capture Fuzhou, and they used the camera to cooperate. They first cut off the rear of Fuzhou, and then used the main force to launch a surprise attack, so that the Japanese army had no time to calmly deploy, so they were able to capture Fuzhou City in one fell swoop. (3) The Chinese soldiers and generals had a heart to avenge their shame and were loyal and brave. The people of Fuqing, Changle, Fuzhou, and Lianjiang went to cooperate in the action, and were able to complete the task and cut its merits. (4) The special warfare was properly coordinated. On August 31, the Chinese plainclothes team mixed into Fuzhou City, and destroyed the Japanese army's telecommunications between Fuzhou and Maxing in advance, and set fire to the rear of the Japanese army in Nantai to disrupt the attack on the main force. In short, after the Jin Xian launched an attack on August 25, in a few days, it captured more than 30 cities and strongholds that were occupied by the Japanese army, which provided favorable support for the attack on Fuzhou. The ability of the people to rise up and assist was the main reason for this success. (12th dispatch)</p>

<h3>5,000 U.S. Trucks are About to Arrive on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Truck can Carry Four Tons and Make a Six-Day Trip. No Bombing can Stop the Road's Transportation.</h3>
<p>New York - An Erstein, a member of the Yunnan-Burma Road Inspection Committee, said yesterday after arriving here that no bombing can stop the transportation of money on the famous Free China Road. Mr. Erstein and another member, David, a U.S. truck expert, are completing a detailed inspection of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Mr. An said, "The consolidation of the Yunnan-Burma Road, even any degree of bombing, cannot stop its transportation work." He also said, "Japan can never defeat China, because they are all determined to resist, and they have unimaginable spirit." He said that he did not encounter any Japanese planes during his six-month trip on the road. Mr. An also announced that 5,000 new trucks from the Lend-Lease Act will arrive in Rangoon in a short period of time. The truck can carry four tons and make a six-day trip. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Today's "Economist" magazine published an article titled "Lend-Lease and Tev Cooper." It argued that it is worth sacrificing to provide more Lend-Lease supplies to China, even if it reduces the supplies obtained by Britain and the Soviet Union, and that it is necessary to help China build an air force that is not very large but effective, in order to contain any southward movement by Japan. The article stated: The transportation of Lend-Lease supplies to China depends on transportation, because the amount of cargo transported on the Yunnan-Burma Road is limited, and a large number of goods are currently stored in Rangoon and have not been transported to China, which may make it difficult for the Lend-Lease program to succeed in its strategy for the Far East. However, since China provides manpower and the United States provides tools, Britain should be able to provide transportation. Because the border between China, Burma, and India is quite long, in addition to the Yunnan-Burma Road and the proposed railway starting from Lashio, it is possible to open other roads in other places, and it is acceptable to open a road from India to the north to China, which is safer. The land there is extremely rugged, but war can produce architectural miracles. The British government has accepted some of these plans in principle, but the most important thing is time. The dispatch of Tev Cooper to the Far East is enough to show that the British government appreciates the importance and urgency of this issue. In addition to transportation, Cooper has many other tasks, but among the issues in the Far East, transportation is the most important. Cooper must manage the lifeline of Asia and become the highest organizer of densely distributed shipping lines, air lines, and car road networks to contain the Japanese aggression. To carry out this major task, it requires strong ability and extremely close cooperation between China and the United States, or even the establishment of another administrative agency in Singapore, but this is also a great opportunity.

<h3>Fierce Battles Outside Leningrad The German Army Suffers Unprecedented Losses Red Army Withdraws from Chernigov in the Kiev Region Germans Gain Foothold on East Bank of Dnieper</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 13th - Director Rosovsky of the Soviet Information Bureau stated last night that the battle currently underway outside Leningrad is so intense as to be almost unbelievable, and that the German losses are so severe as to be unprecedented and unsustainable in the long term. The Germans' urgent desire for a quick victory has not been achieved. Not only are the Soviet army and the Baltic Fleet strongly defending Leningrad, but the residents are also participating in city work, and able-bodied men and women are all taking up arms to resist. No matter how arduous the struggle, the entire Soviet people and government are deeply convinced that the Germans will not be able to occupy Leningrad.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - Yesterday's communiqués from both the German and American sides were extremely simple, but the Soviet-German war has clearly entered another very important stage. The danger faced by Leningrad does not appear to have increased significantly, and the city's defenses remain a formidable obstacle for the German army to overcome. However, the Soviet forces led by General Budyonny in the south appear to be in a precarious situation. The Soviets have admitted that the Germans have gained a foothold on the east bank of the lower Dnieper River. This move by the Germans may be the start of an offensive against the Perekop Isthmus (connecting the Crimean Peninsula to the mainland). In the central sector of the front, the Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are continuing their counter-offensive, but if the Soviet forces advance too far after recapturing Yelnya, their communications will ultimately be difficult to maintain. The current situation is unclear, and predictions of either optimism or pessimism may be wrong. So far, there is no reason to believe that the talent of the Soviet generals and the fighting spirit of the Soviet soldiers are inferior to the tactics of the Nazi mechanized army.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - Today, the fighting around Leningrad and Kiev is intensifying, and there are also fierce battles in other parts of the front. The Germans have intensified their attacks again, hoping to fulfill the orders of their general headquarters to capture these cities by a certain date. The Soviets have admitted that Chernigov, 80 miles northeast of Kiev, has been evacuated after fierce fighting. The German attack on the rear defenses of Kiev from the lower Dnieper River is said to have made some progress. The German daily communiqué states that the offensive is proceeding smoothly according to plan, while the Soviet communiqué only mentions that there is fighting throughout the front. The counter-offensive by General Timoshenko's forces in the Smolensk area has resumed. Berlin dispatches acknowledge that General Voroshilov's forces are also counter-attacking in certain areas 100 miles southwest of Leningrad. These Soviet forces have attacked the rear of the German forces besieging Leningrad twice. It is believed that the attacks on the German rear may be one of the reasons why the German commander-in-chief has set a deadline for the capture of Leningrad. Furthermore, according to a special communiqué from Moscow, several German icebreakers and flat-bottomed boats full of infantry are attempting to sneak along the coast towards Leningrad in the Gulf of Finland. Soviet armed icebreakers spotted them and pursued them at full speed, sinking several icebreakers and two flat-bottomed boats carrying troops. The communiqué also mentioned the fierce air battle over Leningrad on Wednesday, stating that German aircraft repeatedly attempted to raid the city but were repelled, and only a few German aircraft managed to infiltrate the city at night and drop a few bombs. Currently, all the entrances to Leningrad are defended by armored trains, mostly driven by sailors from the Baltic Fleet. Railway workers in Leningrad are now building high-speed trains to attack German-occupied stations.</p>
<h3>US Mission to Go to UK, USSR to Discuss Entire Aid-to-USSR Program Large Quantities of War Materials Already En Route to USSR Soviet Ambassador Oumansky to Return Home for Consultations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th - After meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Mr. Harriman, head of the U.S. mission to the Soviet Union, stated that the U.S. mission to the Soviet Union would soon handle the issue of supplying U.S. aid, which is needed not only by the Soviet Union in the recent period, but also by all countries seeking final victory. The entire aid-to-USSR program will be discussed in Moscow with British and Soviet representatives, and there will be no time limit on this program. The Persian Gulf and Vladivostok will become important ports of entry. The U.S. mission will first go to London to meet with the British mission. When asked whether the UK would transfer a portion of its aid received from the US to the Soviet Union, Mr. Harriman replied that it would be discussed in London and Moscow, as it is a question of where aid can best contribute to the plan to defeat the enemy. War materials are already en route to the Soviet Union, and it is expected that large quantities of aid will be loaded onto ships for shipment in the coming months. The U.S. mission will have a total of 18 members, including 5 main representatives and 13 technical experts. When the mission returns to the U.S., some members will remain permanently stationed in the Soviet Union, with Colonel Faymonville, a military supply officer, as the leader of the permanent staff. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the United States is now doing everything possible to facilitate all assistance to the Soviet Union and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th - President Roosevelt yesterday met with several leaders of the Soviet technical mission to the U.S., who were introduced by Soviet Ambassador Oumansky. It is said that Mr. Oumansky will soon return to Moscow to report in detail on U.S. aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Allied Economic Conference to Be Held in London</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - The date for the Allied economic conference in London is expected to be announced soon. All representatives have now endorsed the Atlantic Charter, so they can discuss other items on the agenda, all of which are economic in nature, such as stockpiling the world's surplus food so that it can be used immediately for relief in liberated areas. All Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, will be represented, and Abyssinia may also be represented.</p>
<h3>German Spokesman Says No Intention to Attack Turkey Reaffirms Turkey's Use of Ports to Attack USSR USSR May Declare War on Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Havas, Swiss Capital, 12th - The "Lausanne Daily" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, stating that according to a German Foreign Ministry spokesman, the rumors that Germany intends to attack Turkey are not true. The relations between Germany and Turkey are not only normal but also very good, which can be seen from the fact that the German economic representatives are currently in the Turkish capital negotiating with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th - The National Broadcasting Corporation's Ankara correspondent reports that Turkey will be the topic of discussion at the meeting between Hitler, Ribbentrop, and German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen. General Loder, German military attaché to Turkey, has been recalled to Germany by Papen. Generals will also attend the meeting and will discuss with the army commanders. According to Axis sources in Turkey, the current military and political situation in Turkey will be thoroughly studied by both sides. Reliable foreign diplomatic sources from Bulgaria have not mentioned that Germany is about to attack or concentrate large forces near the Turkish border or in any part of Bulgaria. However, the Germans are making great efforts to expand and reinforce the ports of Bulgaria. It is also reported that the Soviet envoy to Bulgaria has notified his government that if Bulgaria allows the Nazis to set up more operational bases that endanger the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is very likely to declare war on Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 13th - The Bulgarian cabinet held a cabinet meeting last night for three hours. The content of the cabinet meeting has not yet been officially announced. Well-informed sources believe that the protests made by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria must have been discussed.</p>
<h3>From Hitler's Attack on the Soviet Union A Thought about Napoleon</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 13th - Based on Napoleon's campaign in 1812, Hitler should have arrived in Moscow yesterday. Hitler's failure to occupy Moscow yesterday indicates that he is not as good as Napoleon, and Napoleon's troops marched all the way on foot. Napoleon attacked on June 24 and entered Moscow on September 14. Hitler attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, and the closest point is still 220 miles from Moscow.</p>
<h3>Romania Suddenly Occupies the Timok River Basin Seeks to Control Navigation of the Danube Will Arouse Resentment from Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Havas, Bucharest, 12th - It has been officially announced that Romanian troops have crossed the Romanian-Yugoslav border and occupied the Timok River basin in Yugoslavia to ensure the free navigation of the Danube River. Observers here say that although Romania has long threatened to send troops to Yugoslavia, it was quite unexpected that they would actually do so at this time. The area has a population of 300,000, most of whom are Romanians, but it has never belonged to Romania and has always been part of Serbia. Therefore, there are only two possible reasons for Romania's occupation of the Timok River basin: (1) the Romanians in the area will thus return to the embrace of their motherland; (2) the world-famous Iron Gate gorge, which is very important for the navigation of the Danube River, will be controlled by Romania in the future. However, Romania's move is bound to arouse resentment from Bulgaria, as Bulgaria has been demanding control of the Timok River basin for some time.</p>
<h3>British and Soviet Joint Forces Occupy Key Transportation Points in Iran Block Route to Advance East via the Caucasus Difficulty Overcoming Route for Transporting War Equipment to USSR</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 13th - Iranian oil wells are now safely under British control, and British and Soviet forces have occupied key transportation points in Iran, blocking the route to advance east via the Caucasus. The British and Soviet governments are now extensively studying the issue of transporting war equipment to the Soviet Union via Iran. Iran is three times the size of France, but has only one railway and very few highways, so there are still major difficulties to be overcome in transporting war equipment. The three main routes that can be used in Iran are: (1) the railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, which is 1,000 miles long; (2) the highway from the starting point of the Quetta-Zahedan railway in Baluchistan, through Mashhad in eastern Persia, to the Soviet railway on the northeastern border of Iran, which is 1,000 miles long; (3) the highway from Basra to Tehran. As far as the railway line is concerned, the section from Tehran through the Alborz Mountains to the Caspian Sea is expected to be blocked by snow within one or two months. Therefore, materials will mostly be transported by rail from the Persian Gulf to Tehran, then by truck to the Caspian Sea ports, and then by ship to Baku. The lack of trains on the Iranian railway and the problem of clearing snow from mountain highways for three or four months each year are difficulties that must be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Petain's Strong Rival Ditert is Still Alive</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 13th - It was rumored that Ditert, the editor of the "Paris Working Daily," who was injured at the same time as Dunval, had died of his injuries. Well-informed sources here recently confirmed to us that Mr. Ditert is still recovering in Versailles Hospital.</p>
<h3>European War Talks (79) The Vast Territory and People of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>This article is a record from the New York Times, and is translated as follows:</p>
<p>The first impression that foreigners get when they go to Soviet Russia is simply "vastness." The territory of Soviet Russia accounts for one-sixth to one-seventh of the earth's surface. Excluding the sparsely populated, frigid wilderness in the north and Siberia, and the vast deserts of Central Asia, there remains a very large area with a variety of climates and temperatures, and people of all cultures, from the indigenous people of love tea chamo to world-renowned scholars and scientists.</p>
<p>In the Caucasus and Central Asia, there are continuous mountain ranges and towering peaks. However, the typical scenery of Soviet Russia shows the vastness of its territory. The plains and fields are vast, extending almost endlessly as far as the eye can see. Eleven years ago, the Soviet government, upon the official opening of the new railway connecting Turkestan to Siberia, invited journalists from various countries to attend the opening ceremony. They traveled for six days before reaching their destination.</p>
<p>In addition to this impression of "vastness," one can also get an impression of "multitude." Among all the countries in the world, the number of Caucasians contained within a single political unit is by far the largest in Soviet Russia, with a population of no less than 170 million, and this does not include the newly occupied areas that are now war zones. The entire history of Russia has been largely based on outward expansion, sometimes even clashing with nations close to Western civilization, such as the Swedes and Poles. Although Russia has suffered many military defeats, since the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, no conqueror has been able to make this country with its vast territory and people completely obedient.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of Russia's natural geography, which can be reflected in the psychology of the people, is its tendency toward extremes. On the temperate European continent, there is no place that can find such extreme cold as Siberia and such extreme heat as the Central Asian deserts. Even though the Soviet government is creating some uniform standards, practically making everyone study the same ideas, read the same newspapers, and have textile mills weave cloth to replace the yarn spun by farm families and the diverse and bizarre clothing worn in the past, one can still see many different races along the way from Minsk to Vladivostok, or from Moscow to the Caucasus and Crimea.</p>
<p>Russians account for more than half of the total population of the Soviet Union. The southern provinces of the country, located in Europe, are fertile plains, mainly inhabited by Ukrainian farmers. In the mountainous Caucasus region, many races and tribes are mixed together. It is rare to see such a situation where people living next door to each other cannot understand each other's languages.</p>
<p>Russia is a Eurasian country. From the nationality and psychology of the Russian people, it can be seen that she has missed three movements that have made great contributions to the liberation of individuality: the Reformation, the Renaissance, and the French Revolution. There is also another layer. The various elements in other European countries that resist autocratic rule, such as powerful nobles, free cities, or important classes among the gentry and commoners, are also non-existent in Russia. Medieval Russian tyrants, such as "Ivan the Terrible," could arbitrarily kill the most powerful noble as easily as killing the most humble serf. This tradition is still preserved under the Stalin government.</p>
<p>Soviet literature and music are deeply influenced by Eastern civilization. Her greatest lyric poets, Pushkin and Lermontov, often depicted the customs of the Caucasus. Linisky Korsakov's dramas or Russian songs and dances all have Eastern colors. The land border line of the Soviet Union in Asia is particularly long, so Russians have much closer contact with Turks, Persians, Chinese and other Asians than Europeans, but Russia's contribution to Eastern ethnology and exploration is quite small.</p>
<p>The personality, thoughts, and even soul of the Russian people have many characteristics that can remain unchanged despite drastic changes in the outside world.</p>
<p>Russians are often rich in abstract ideas. Great writers such as Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Chekhov are sometimes kind and sometimes satirical. Their 19th-century intellectuals often longed for a perfect future world. It can even be said that the entire Russian culture has this kind of ideal (before the 19th century, Russia had almost no civilization except for religious art). As for foreigners—for example, Germans—they can try to improve the imperfect world as much as possible from a practical point of view.</p>
<p>This extreme freedom of thought, although very civilized and moving, is sometimes too idealistic and impractical, and was later swept away by the revolutionary tide. However, it can still maintain its power under Communism. The Soviet authorities drew up two major five-year economic plans, which encompassed everything from the steel industry to barbershops, and nothing was left out of the overall calculation. I am afraid that other nations besides the Soviet Union would not have thought of this!</p>
<p>During my stay in Soviet Russia, I often felt deeply that the Russian mind was full of perfectionism, and almost completely lacked moderation, compromise, and gradual progress. For example, if a communist member cites a few examples of repression and persecution under foreign systems, no matter who tells him that there are countless people who are being repressed and persecuted under the current Soviet system, he will always ignore it.</p>
<p>Communism is new, but this idea of perfectionism is innate to the Russian people. Nicholas Berdaeli, one of the most famous modern thinkers in Russia, once put forward an accurate theory that England is immersed in liberalism and France is fascinated by doubt, but these two doctrines are absolutely not suitable for the Russian mind.</p>
<p>In Dostoevsky's novels, it can be seen everywhere that Russians are very inclined to spiritual extremes, have the ability to explore the hidden depths of the human soul, and are very impatient with moderation. During the Russian Revolution, the intellectual class was influenced by Western civilization through research and contact, and hoped to establish a new political system after the Tsarist government, respecting individual personality and civil liberties. However, their disappointment and material and spiritual pain are self-evident.</p>
<p>The Russian people have an amazing ability to easily regard ideals as facts. They explain future plans as if they have already been put into practice, with vivid language and no embellishment. Imagination has created a bridge between thought and practice, linking them together. This kind of imagination, when used in art, can produce brilliant masterpieces. Russia's most significant cultural success, especially in literature and music, was achieved in the 19th century, and its development was extremely rapid, unlike the gradual progress of the cultures of England, France, and Germany. In terms of art, the Russian people's talent is indeed in the middle of people.</p>
<p>Closely linked to this ability to imagine and artistic talent are intelligence and creativity, which they have also been greatly endowed with. For example, the large-scale parachute descent of troops from the air is the most shocking tactic in modern warfare, but the inventor was the Red Army. However, before the outbreak of this European war, no one could be sure what major impact paratroopers would have on the war. Therefore, comparing the performance of the Red Army in the Soviet-Finnish War with the achievements of German paratroopers in the battles of Holland and Crete, there is really a world of difference.</p>

<h3>U.S. Requisitions Danish Ship; Another Sunk by Torpedo in Icelandic Waters; All 26 Crew Members Rescued</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th – The State Department announced last night that the American vessel Montana, flying the Panamanian flag, was sunk by a torpedo en route from the U.S. to Iceland. All 26 crew members, none of whom were American, were rescued. This ship, originally the Danish vessel Paul, was recently requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission and renamed. On August 29th, it departed Wilmington, North Carolina, carrying a shipment of lumber purchased by the Icelandic government, bound for Iceland. According to a naval report, it was sunk by a torpedo at 8:45 AM on the 11th. According to news from Washington, a non-American aircraft happened to be flying overhead when the ship was attacked, and those on board witnessed the crew escaping in small boats after the ship was hit. The ship had a displacement of 1,549 tons.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 13th – It was announced here last night that the Panamanian freighter Montana was sunk by a torpedo on the 11th (twelve hours before President Roosevelt's speech) at 63°40' North latitude, 35°50' West longitude.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 12th – Of the 26 crew members who escaped the Montana, 18 were Danish, 5 were Norwegian, and the remaining 3 were Greek, Belgian, and Spanish.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 13th – Secretary of the Navy Knox submitted a report to President Roosevelt yesterday regarding the sinking of the Montana. This is the third American ship to be attacked recently, indicating that the Axis powers have intensified their maritime warfare against British supply lines. The Sessa was sunk on August 17th, but this was not announced beforehand. The Steel Seafarer was sunk by aircraft in the Red Sea on September 7th. Knox stated that British patrol planes witnessed the Montana being attacked by a torpedo. U.S. aircraft did not witness the ship sinking. When asked if U.S. warships had rushed to the scene to search for submarines, Knox stated that there were apparently no U.S. warships in the vicinity. He also said that he had no reports regarding whether aircraft had attacked the submarine.</p>
<h3>German Submarines in the North Atlantic; Claim 24 Ships in Convoy Sunk; British Ships in North Sea Air Raid Suffer No Losses</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 12th – The High Command announced tonight that yesterday, German submarines attacked an enemy convoy in the North Atlantic. The convoy consisted of 40 merchant ships en route from the U.S. to Britain. Twenty-two ships, totaling 134,000 tons, have been sunk. Two other ships, totaling 11,000 tons, were also hit by torpedoes and are presumed to have sunk. In addition, German aircraft sank three enemy freighters near Yarmouth, England, last night, totaling 21,000 tons. A British light cruiser was also damaged in the vicinity. In total, over the past few days, 145,000 tons of enemy merchant shipping have been sunk.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – The British Admiralty announced that during an enemy air raid on a British convoy in the North Sea on Thursday night, in addition to one enemy bomber shot down by the British destroyer "Wimera," another was damaged. One small British merchant ship was damaged and is now safely in port. One person was killed on another merchant ship. The German command yesterday claimed that aircraft attacked a heavily guarded British convoy northeast of Yarmouth on Thursday night, sinking three freighters totaling 21,000 tons. In reality, no British ships were sunk, and the damaged ship was less than 3,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Envoy Arrives in Singapore to Investigate Economic Conditions</h3>
<p>Singapore, 13th – U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Grady, dispatched to the Far East by President Roosevelt to investigate conditions, arrived here today from Java.

Regarding the President's speech, he believes one thing is certain: the President is determined to eliminate aggressors worldwide. (13th dispatch)</p>

<p>Whether the cancellation of the black market exchange rate can be realized this time is still uncertain. Among the bankers who are assiduously seeking profit, there are indeed many who are willing to help China, but there are also inevitably those who like to play tricks in the black market and make quick money in the gaps. Once the black market exchange rate is cancelled, the fat cats who have become accustomed to good appetites over the years, either out of fear of their own government's orders, or unable to overcome the condemnation of public morality and conscience, will have to temporarily put down the "bread in their mouths." However, since foreign exchange is restricted, and they are greedy for the zero-three-one-two-five commission, how can these old men in the style of big compradors, who are accustomed to eating well, using well, living in foreign houses, and riding in cars, truly face the arrival of autumn and drink dew? Unexpectedly, yesterday in the market, the black market exchange rate, which had been silent for five days, actually saw a resurgence. Banque de l'Indochine sold spot U.S. dollars at 4.8125 yuan, which were snapped up by import firms dealing in non-essential goods. The market trend slightly softened, and no further trading was opened until after noon. At noon, the closing prices were British pounds at 2 and a half shillings 8.4375 yuan, and U.S. dollars at 4.8125 yuan, which were tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day's prices. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. According to a certain person in the exchange market, fourteen British and American banks will restore black market foreign exchange trading next Monday (tomorrow) in order to save the prosperity of the city's import and export firms. This remains to be verified. Banque de l'Indochine is not listed among the fourteen foreign banks, but since it is not among the fourteen banks, how can the U.S. dollars in the hands of Banque de l'Indochine be able to break free from the restrictions of frozen assets and still be freely traded? And why is there talk of others following suit? If so, then the so-called freezing and cancellation of the black market exchange rate is a big joke. It is unlikely that the British and American governments would advise their merchants to comply with it in the front and then go back on their word a few days later, which would make people regard the actions of the great British and American powers as child's play. Therefore, it can be decided that there is no such thing. Looking at yesterday's report on the foreign exchange market, Hua Shang in the United States, due to the inability to withdraw cash, went around selling their U.S. dollar deposit accounts to import firms dealing in non-essential goods so that they could transfer the money to American banks. However, it is now known that the news of American bank transfers is completely inaccurate. From this one point alone, how do we know that the rumour circulating in the market yesterday that British and American firms would restore the black market is not unfounded? However, human hearts are unpredictable, and they are only interested in profit, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign. We cannot guarantee that there will be no black market in the black market exchange rate, or uncontrolled within the scope of control. However, if the black market openly resumes, two exchange rates will inevitably occur, one high and one low. The benefits between the high and low will still be taken away by the middlemen who make quick money. The prices of goods for which foreign exchange is not provided will of course be high, and the prices of goods for which foreign exchange is provided will also be raised. The supply of the officially determined exchange rate has the name but not the reality, and all foreign exchange trading markets will inevitably follow the black market. This kind of trickery will damage the foreign exchange fund, worsen the livelihood of the public, and benefit a group of fat cats related to foreign exchange. Reasonably speaking, there should not be such abnormal and perverse facts, and it is not something that should exist in reality. However, it is said that there is a loophole in the foreign exchange application cancellation guarantee. How do we know that the foreign exchange applied for will not be diverted to other places? This is also unavoidable speculation. However, for the welfare of the public, the more rectified the foreign exchange, the better. Let's see if the rumour circulating in the market becomes a reality. It shouldn't be far away.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 13th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened this morning very smoothly, and all exchange rates showed no change. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 13th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. The telegraphic transfers from London and New York still showed no change. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by five cents, to ninety yuan. The "Joint Notes" in the gray market were cheaper by three cents seven points, to fifty yuan zero seven cents nine points.</p>
<h3>Cash is Being Searched For Again; Exceeds 9,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the gold market, the speculation in the gray market and the futures market changed to using the Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange rate as the new standard for closing prices. The voice was very high, but it is still under careful consideration. There is talk of a flash opening next Monday, so the bulls and bears on October gold are still constantly closing positions. Although there are rumours from Hong Kong about Sino-Japanese peace, the sudden opening of the foreign exchange black market caused the market price to soften, and short covering was more eager, rising from 6,862 yuan to 6,875 yuan, finally squeezing up by seven yuan, with a turnover of more than 800 taels. Cash also continued to advance upward, exceeding 9,000 yuan, because a certain bank was searching for it again. From the morning opening, it was already 20 yuan higher. Hesheng entered Dafeng ten taels, for 8,960 yuan. Tianyuan suddenly came to enter Dazan ten taels, for 8,970 yuan, and entered Decheng ten taels, Xianghe twenty taels, Yifeng seventy taels, for 8,990 yuan. Xianghe entered Tianyuan, Yongcheng, Dafeng forty taels, for 9,000 yuan and 9,010 yuan, Tongkang Yong entered Tianyuan twenty taels, and Sui Fu called ten taels, for 9,030 to 40 yuan, which were sold by Yifeng and Lianxing, and the market trend once leveled off. Defu suddenly re-entered Chengji fifty taels, Xianghe entered Xinyuan, Yongan, Yida and other eighty taels, rising to 9,050 yuan. Xiangxing Yong and Defu sold out, falling to 9,010 yuan. Xianghe and Yongcheng each entered Tianyuan and other thirty to fifty taels, raising to 9,040 yuan, Xiangxing Yong and Chengji each sold fifty taels again. Finally, Deshun sold Xinyuan ten taels, for 9,010 yuan, which was 70 yuan higher than the previous day, with a turnover of more than 600 taels. The market price of gold bars at the Golden Gate of the Golden House was 9,050 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan. There is no price or market for the current bid gold. The price of jewellery gold was unchanged, still 920 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Futures Squeeze Up Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price of October futures in the grey market at 9:15 am was still 6,862 yuan per bar (ten taels), Chengji Hengji successively entered, slightly increasing to 6,875 yuan, which was spat out by Shunyuan, and was often returned lower. The noon closing price was 6,869 yuan, up seven yuan. The high and low on the day were also 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Wants to Rise But Stops</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewellery in silver buildings was listed by Datonghang and Xintonghang at 10 yuan higher in the morning, for 930 yuan, but it was returned lower at 10:30 am, still listed at 920 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 50 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollars Increasingly Needed</p>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign currency market, the cash price continued to rise, and British and American gold pounds each rose by five yuan. British banknotes remained fixed, and the market price stabilized. The demand for U.S. dollar notes was increasingly strong, once pulling up to 11 yuan 70 cents. The noon closing price was 21 yuan 45 cents, which was 25 cents higher than the previous day. The supply and demand of Hong Kong notes were even, and the market price stabilized. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended upwards, with the former rising to 2 yuan 34 cents and the latter rising to 1 yuan 91 cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Cotton Yarn Momentum Weak; Rally Immediately Returns to Fatigue</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rebounded the previous day, fell back into a soft state yesterday. However, the trend is still moderate, so the decline is winding. However, speculators believe that the previous day's peak of 1,768 yuan failed to break through to a new high, so some turned to short selling. It is also said that there will not be a big rush in the short term, so the sentiment is tending downwards. In fact, the fundamental problem is feared to be still in a state of flux. As for current yarn sales, although there is no development in wholesale, sporadic transactions by Hong Kong merchants are more active. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,766 yuan, the low price was 1,751 yuan, and the closing price was 1,751 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of market at the end of the week, 375 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with tight sentiment. The opening price was 1,765 yuan. After a short while, due to the decline of the bulls, it fell to 1,761 yuan. However, there were still many people on the floor eager to buy in small amounts, and it rose again to 1,766 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange opened weakly, and the sentiment was relatively lax. However, sellers on the floor did not rush to sell, and it fluctuated between 1,760 yuan for a long time. By the time of closing, because the exchange price was still sluggish, the floating longs were sold off, and it closed weakly at 1,7571 yuan. It is estimated that the turnover in the half day was 8,700 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same trade 8,500 Hong Kong 200</p>
<p>Total 8,700</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market situation went from slightly firm to downstream, and the ground seemed to reveal fluctuations. The upward momentum of US cotton has already diminished, and there is no significant stimulus in international developments. The rumors of catching wind and grabbing shadows are old tricks of speculators, so they could not last long and dissipated again, causing the market sentiment to rise and fall like a rabbit and a falcon, seemingly without the strength to continue to be firm. When the market opened in the morning, it was initially firm due to firm factory orders, and the September contract had some short covering, so the trend was still strong for a while, reaching 1,668 yuan, almost opening at a high price. Afterwards, the near-term contract still felt stable, with the October contract opening at 1,679 yuan, a slight increase of three yuan. However, after being dragged down by the exchange, factory orders followed suit, and the period yarn lacked the strength to support it, eventually entering a weak path. Therefore, the November contract fell from 1,692 yuan at the opening, almost closing at a low price. It can be seen that each group seemed to have the intention of selling off one after another. The high and low prices in the half day varied only by five to ten yuan. Large players had no scruples because it was the weekend, so trading was very quiet. As a result, the September contract closed at 1,665 yuan, which was still slightly better by one yuan. The October contract closed at 1,675 yuan, a drop of one yuan. The November contract was even more sluggish, falling to 1,682 yuan and five jiao at the close, a drop of as much as seven yuan and five jiao. Looking at the trend, if the bulls cannot continue with good news for a long time, we should consider the potential strength, so the future may have a winding path. There was no market in the afternoon. The transaction prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Saturday Cotton Market: Reduced Turnover</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is not very active. Due to a slight improvement in supply and the firm condition of US cotton, factory sentiment has improved slightly. However, most of the trading is in Indian cotton, and other inventories are dwindling. In addition, due to the Saturday factor, all parties lack strong influence, resulting in a significant reduction in turnover.</p>
<p>Another message: There is not much development in cotton trading outside the port. Although factories and various cotton houses have the intention to purchase, they are limited by the inability to settle foreign exchange and repeated delays in shipping schedules, so few actual deals are made.</p>
<p>New York cotton market: Initially, due to positive political news from Washington and unfavorable weather, it rose, and the market situation was very firm. However, subsequently, it fell due to the sale of some floating longs. As a result, the closing price rose by about five to eleven points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton market: Initially, it fell due to retail sales and long liquidation. However, subsequently, it rebounded due to purchases by European exporters. As a result, yesterday's closing price rose by about one to four维比. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 0.25 rupee today.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bond Market Still Firm</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was open for only one session yesterday, as it was Saturday. Due to strong sentiment, it continued to be good. Category C bonds broke through the two-yuan mark again, entered the mark several times, but eventually exited again. It can be seen that the market is stable, and there is no significant change in the environment. When the market opened yesterday morning, Xinfu still had the intention to buy, and Runde Shengda also absorbed some. Retail purchases were also lively. Category C bonds saw a market price of 72 yuan and three jiao again. Subsequently, due to the selling of Gongmao, Yitai, Xie Kang, etc., it once fell back to two yuan, and then closed at two yuan and two jiao. Other varieties also benefited from this, and all rose by three to four jiao. The turnover was about 1.4 million yuan. A brief listing is as follows:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of New New Company were traded at a price of 33 yuan and seven jiao and a half.</p>
<p>London, 12th (Week Nine) Telegram: Today's listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks: Chinese government bonds only rose by one pound for the reorganisation British gold, priced at 38 pounds. British stocks suddenly showed an improvement, with Shanghai Tramway shares rising by three pence, priced at 15 shillings and nine pence. Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to rise by one shilling and six pence, priced at 15 shillings and six pence. Korean Coal Mine shares also rose by one shilling and six pence, priced at five shillings and six pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Slow Sales, Short Selling Also Active</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign rice seems to be trending in a fluctuating state, and it is still in this state. When the market opened early in the morning, real sales were difficult to handle due to high prices, and ball trading seemed to be taking advantage of the situation to short sell. The original root merchants followed suit, and the market suddenly became soft again, with various prices falling again. For example, the Bank's small package was devalued to 106 yuan. Suddenly, some rural customers bought foreign warehouse small patterned rice, and although the number was limited at one time, it immediately showed a brisk color. In the past, Bank warehouse goods had to be lower by one yuan to one and a half yuan, but now they were almost on par with Bank warehouse goods, only half a yuan apart. Initially, it jumped from 105 yuan to 106 yuan and a half, and although Bank warehouse small packages also rose successively, they only reached 106 yuan and a half, 107 yuan. As for other goods, because the channels in this street were always not smooth, they remained all the way soft and lacked change, with all prices falling by one or two yuan compared to the previous market closing price. Yinghua Si broken rice was 91 yuan, and small packages were 133 yuan to 132 yuan and a half, also slightly weaker than the previous market. The total daily turnover was 23,400 bags of existing rice, and more than 200 tons of Yinghua Si rice.</p>
<p>Thick and thin broken stems and new japonica and other domestic rice: Yesterday, the early rice in Nanhong suddenly had a limited arrival of goods due to rain obstruction, and the sellers' intention to sell turned firm. At the same time, local customers took advantage of the devaluation to be active, and their intention to buy was also strong, so the price suddenly rebounded by one or two yuan, opening at 150 yuan, 148 yuan. Thick stems lacked goods and lacked transactions, and the trading was extremely small, without any honor or disgrace. Pudong new japonica rice continued to be outstanding due to its fresh and fragrant goods. Although the market price on the surface was still only 153 yuan to 152 yuan, in fact, the quality of different goods had already been secretly raised by one yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice: The sales of ordinary goods are less, so even if the goods are scarce, it is difficult to stand firm, and it has depreciated by nearly one yuan, opening at 113,4 yuan to 21 yuan. However, special goods are still quite popular due to their wide sales, and they continue to sell for 127,8 yuan. Glutinous tea follows the lead of the next grade goods, falling by one yuan, opening at 111 yuan, 110 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Vermicelli Slightly Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign vermicelli market had mixed ups and downs, but the fluctuations were slight, which was the normal fluctuation in a fair time. Jinlong brand vermicelli sales were active, and the newly arrived Pudong warehouse goods were welcomed by local customers. The warehouse price opened at 31 yuan and three jiao, and then rose to 31 yuan and four jiao and a half. The West warehouse initially fluctuated at 30 yuan and seven jiao, and closed at 30 yuan and eight jiao, an increase of one or two jiao compared to the previous market. However, with confirmed orders and incoming goods for American vermicelli, the fort went from 32 yuan five or six jiao back to 32 yuan three or four jiao at the close. Banana was 32 yuan one yuan to 32 yuan, which was smaller by two jiao. The total daily turnover was still 30,000 bags, with real sales and hoarders each accounting for half. Wheat still had sporadic arrivals, and the market price was variable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Arriving Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the edible oil market was weak in the spot market and flat in the futures market. It was found that the spot goods were weak and soft because raw soybean oil was arriving steadily, and Changxi also had wholesale shipments to Shanghai, and the actual sales were sluggish and difficult to be smooth. It was heard that the purchase price of Qingdao raw oil had been reduced by another ten yuan, at about 160 yuan. However, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil were supported by speculators who wanted to try their best, so the market was fluctuating and relatively flat. The trading yesterday was very quiet. It was estimated that more than 3,000 dan of Qing oil produced by Dayou Factory were sold in the September contract, at a price of 169 yuan to 171 yuan. There were also nearly 1,000 barrels of rapeseed oil produced by Rihua Factory, at a price of 169 yuan to 172 yuan. There were also 100 barrels of rapeseed oil produced by Taishan Factory, at a price of 160 yuan. There were also 150 cans of Jiangbei soybean oil inquired about in this street, at a price of 238 yuan. Yesterday, 1,500 cans of raw oil and 300 bags of beans came from Tianjin. Today, 500 bags will be transshipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Although Real Sales Have No New Developments, Cotton Cloth Factory盘甚紧</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The trend in yesterday's market was flat, with no new developments in real sales, and the factory盘甚紧. Peers and hoarders mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the market price remained unchanged. However, a small number of out-of-stock goods were still seeing price increases. Wholesale numbers in this street purchased more than 200 pieces. Demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants increased slightly, purchasing more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, khaki drill, twill colored cloth, etc. Nanyang merchants purchased two hundred and several tens of pieces of coarse cloth bleached and dyed cloth. Today, 1,370 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: Exchange cotton cloth fell by four jiao in September, fell by叫角四分 in October, fell by one jiao and a half in November, and fell by two jiao and four fen in December. The selling price of spot cloth fell by about one jiao. Four Gentlemen Serge fell by five li. The turnover was very rare, because the market was indifferent and due to the weekend factor.</p>
<h3>New Autumn Woolen Fabrics Sell Well</h3>
<p>Now is the new autumn, the weather is turning cooler, and the sales of woolen fabrics are brisk. The real sales of Chinese and Western clothing materials have surged. Various stores in this street that sell woolen fabrics, silk and satin, foreign goods, clothing for men and women, old and new clothing, raincoat and overcoat making places, shoe and hat making places, etc., have strong demand in both retail and wholesale. Because the merchants are restricted by the unified control and the difficulty in obtaining transport permits, only Nanjing merchants are currently purchasing. The hoarding of spring, summer, autumn and winter goods by internal and external merchants is still smooth, making the market even busier. Yesterday, Fengda striped camel hair sold for 8.5 yuan per yard, Weishuanglu picture 12 yuan, Yuanfeng Flying Horse picture tweed 48 yuan, Yinfeng grass green Walter tweed 68 yuan, Dahua sheep picture 55 yuan, Futai first-class suit wool 90 yuan, embossed overcoat wool 220 yuan, Huada Ma Zong satin 4 yuan, Wufeng cotton-woven breeches 3.8 yuan, Yousheng rainproof cloth 6.4 yuan, Yinfeng 1470 French lining 2.2 yuan, black charcoal lining 62 jiao.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Walnuts Present New, Longkou Noodles Fall Back, New Xiang Lotus Declines</h3>
<p>The first batch of Tianjin peaches was transported by Tianjin merchants yesterday with 38 bags. They were immediately sampled and sold for 200 yuan. It is heard that the Shanghai merchants also have the second batch to do. The market is temporarily flat. Longkou vermicelli was previously available for 210 yuan in the previous market. Later, the demand from Nanyang merchants gradually weakened, and there were only a few transactions in this street. Recently, only Ningbo merchants have purchased more than 100 packages. It is found that the inventory in Shanghai is gradually increasing, so the current market has fallen by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<p>After seeing the new lotus root in this lake, the arrival of goods has increased. Yesterday morning, Hankou merchants opened more than 30 packages, breaking the 400 yuan mark, at 395 yuan, and sold at 398 yuan. The market situation may be tight again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the easing of the Pacific situation, and there were no temporary problems with supply. The sentiment was soft, and the price turned down. The association allocated spot goods of 24 coarse white, September new goods 134 yuan three jiao, August 134 yuan, 33 yuan seven jiao, small yuan half, July 133 yuan, small one yuan seven jiao, June 132 yuan four jiao, small two yuan one jiao, Hong Kong coarse white 124 yuan eight jiao, 24 yuan, with similar declines. Dutch red was 124 yuan, and the market was relatively flat, with few other transactions.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Fall Again</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is falling like a broken bamboo, because the factory is constantly supplying, causing extreme panic among all parties. Spot goods in the market are unusually smooth, so the price has plummeted. The market has plummeted by several hundred yuan again, with Great Britain brand 2,150 yuan, Old Knife brand 1,500 yuan, Five Flowers brand 1,070 yuan, Fairy brand 1,130 yuan, Pinhai brand 1,350 yuan, and 20 branches of Da Nan Wei 1,300 yuan per 10,000. However, yesterday's market盘 of Huacheng and Yizhong companies announced price increases. The new prices are detailed in the market price column.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Tails Surge to Arrive, Plunging, Winter Mushrooms and Dried Scallops Sell for Hundreds of Yuan Less</h3>
<p>Shrimp tails have recently been arriving from various parties, and the value is too high, so the price has plummeted. Yesterday, Shandakan tails opened at 800 yuan, and Chao Bian tails were called for 1,600 yuan. Yantai Longxudao tails and Jiangbei tails also arrived in succession, and the market situation was even weaker, and no one even asked about them. Dried scallops were called for 1,400 yuan. Although the remaining winter mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms were each called for hundreds of yuan less, the industry players were all watching from the sidelines, so there was no market.</p>

<h3>American Bank US Dollar Deposits: Not Allowed to Be Sold to Importers; Depositors Tout Everywhere Attempting to Transfer Accounts; All Banks Refuse According to Instructions; Chinese Banks Are Ordered to Give Special Treatment to Remittances to the Rear</h3>
<p>Since the Exchange Equalization Committee formulated measures for the Shanghai foreign exchange market, although various steps are still being implemented separately, their effectiveness can already have a better effect on various aspects of Shanghai's foreign exchange market and finance. According to reporters' reliable sources yesterday, various measures to stabilize the Shanghai foreign exchange market are being carefully promoted. The black foreign exchange market feels that there is no room for maneuver due to the detailed regulations of the Exchange Equalization Committee, and it will inevitably tend to complete decline in a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>US Dollar Deposits: Difficult to Move</p>
<p>Local Chinese merchants in this city are quite uneasy because of the restrictions on the freezing of funds in the United States, and the strict management of the 14 banks in this city by the Equalization Committee. All US Bank US Dollar depositors have no way to move their funds. They are trying to sell them to import merchants who are not allowed to apply for foreign exchange settlement for non-essential goods, hoping to transfer funds in US banks to pay for imported goods. It is now known that the US banks have received instructions from the US government that all account transfers will not be granted. Therefore, the attempts of Chinese merchants in US banks to resell and transfer funds can be said to have vanished.</p>
<p>Inland Transfer of Floating Capital: Ordered to Give Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee cooperates with banks of friendly nations and the four national banks of China to manage the Shanghai foreign exchange market, suppress speculative arbitrage and eliminate the black market, and promote the inland transfer of Shanghai's floating capital by the Ministry of Finance and Economics to complete the national construction. Now the four national banks of China and commercial banks have been ordered to formulate appropriate measures to encourage the inland transfer of funds for remittances to the rear, that is, those remitted from Shanghai to various provinces and cities in the rear, with reference to the market situation, such as exempting remittance fees and handling fees. At the same time, the interest rate for funds deposited in banks and firms in various provinces and cities in the rear will be increased, and the government will provide effective security for the safety of principal and interest.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank Deposits: Reduce Interest Rates</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society inquired from banking circles yesterday that the deposits of Chinese nationals in Shanghai banks and firms, including Chinese and foreign banks and money shops, were estimated at 285 million yuan by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China, an increase of almost double compared with the beginning of the war in the 26th year of the Republic of China. However, fixed deposits accounted for only 21%, while demand deposits accounted for 79%. In view of the sharp increase in deposits, the banks and firms feel that the normal investment channels are narrow. In order to reduce the burden, they have all reduced the interest rates on fixed and demand deposits. Demand savings have been reduced from 5% to 1.5%, and no interest is paid on balances below 1,000 yuan for check withdrawals. Fixed deposits have been reduced from 8% to 7%, and all preferential measures have been completely cancelled. Foreign banks do not pay interest on national currency demand deposits.</p>
<p>Remittances to the Interior: Increased</p>
<p>After the banks of friendly nations and the four national banks cooperate fully, the black market for foreign exchange has disappeared invisibly, and various speculative venues have lost their basis. Those who hoard national goods can apply for fixed foreign exchange in accordance with the law for the import of essential goods, so prices tend to fall. Therefore, hoarders have suffered greatly from the elimination of the black market for foreign exchange. The entire finance can be stable for a long time. Recently, Shanghai's floating capital has naturally moved inland, and remittances from banks to the interior have increased. This is indeed a good phenomenon for finance. At the same time, the public bonds issued by the national government, such as unified bonds, are selling well and the prices are high. It is said that some floating capital is used to purchase public bonds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Japanese Merchants: Change of Perspective</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, since the Exchange Equalization Committee stopped supplying black market foreign exchange on the 8th of this month, and also stipulated official prices, implemented unified control and managed foreign exchange, it is a major change for the Shanghai market and the international commodity trading sector. This decision by the Exchange Equalization Committee is actually cooperating with Britain and the United States to economically oppress Japan in the Far East, in order to cut off and suffocate the use of Shanghai for overseas economic activities. The Exchange Equalization Committee has now unified the import of Shanghai, and will also implement the same level of unified control over exports. Therefore, the scope of activities of Japanese merchants in Shanghai will be completely cut off from overseas markets. Therefore, after the United States froze Chinese and Japanese funds, Japan's trade policy shifted from obtaining foreign goods to China, so in the future, the scope of economic activities of Japanese merchants will be limited to this scope. On the other hand, the activities of Chinese and foreign merchants in the future will be completely opposite to those of Japanese merchants. Their management center must be transferred to non-occupied areas, and the external channels must be concentrated in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Only Dozens of Americans Returned to Their Country Today</h3>
<p>Harrison Wheel Set Sail This Afternoon</p>
<p>American ships are arriving in Shanghai one after another. The President Cleveland and Taylor have left the port one after another. There are still two cargo ships loading and unloading cargo in Shanghai. As soon as the export goods are loaded, they will return to the United States.</p>
<p>Harrison Wheel: Arrived Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 10 am, the Harrison 　 President cruise ship came to Shanghai from Little Luzon via Port Ya, and docked at buoy twelve or thirteen. It is scheduled to set sail this afternoon to return to the United States. The small passenger ship was decided to depart from the New Customs pier at 11:30 am. Only a dozen people came to Shanghai on the ship. More than sixty people took the original ship to the United States via Shanghai. No more than sixty American expatriates from this city took the ship back to their country. The next American ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai and return to the United States in the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Alcott: Returned to His Country by Ship</p>
<p>The famous American news commentator Mr. Alcott is also scheduled to take the Harrison to Manila and the United States for a month's vacation tonight. Yesterday afternoon, the American Chamber of Commerce specially hosted a banquet for Mr. Alcott at its address on Fuzhou Road, while the British Zhuojia Air Force Association also invited Mr. Alcott to attend the association's special luncheon at 12:30, and presented a silver cup as a gift. The British Expatriate Association also presented a watch as a token of farewell.

<h3>Hong Kong Airport: Cargo Inspection Measures</h3>
<p>Goods Transported to the Interior Must Be Pre-Certified; The Order of Certification Will Be Determined According to the Urgency of Need</p>
<p>Since the China and Eurasia Airlines opened the Hong Kong-Nanhong route, handling passenger and cargo transportation, the passenger ticket from Hong Kong to Hong is 270 Hong Kong dollars, the cargo is 3.7 Hong Kong dollars per kilogram, the chartered plane is 7,000 Hong Kong dollars, carrying 900 kilograms, and it is stipulated that urgent government documents must be transported first. Commercial goods are numbered in the order of registration. However, some unscrupulous people are actually operating in collusion, soliciting the transport of goods and trying to manipulate them for profit. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Communications, in order to adjust cargo transportation and prevent malpractices, specially established the Air Cargo Inspection Office, and appointed Huang Boqiao, the former director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, as the chief inspector of the office, which has been implemented since September 11. Shanghai merchants should pay attention to the internal transport of goods. The inspection measures led by the Ministry are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After Certification, It Can Be Received for Transportation</p>

(2) The inspection of cargoes carried by the Hong Kong Station shall be the responsibility of the Air Cargo Inspection Office stationed in Hong Kong by the Ministry. (3) The Hong Kong Station shall report the name, number of pieces, and weight of the goods reported by the consignor to the Inspection Office for certification before they can be received for transportation. (4) The Hong Kong Station shall give priority to the shipment of public goods delivered by the central government authorities or their agents, and the public goods delivered by the provincial government authorities or their agents shall be decided after the public goods of the central government authorities have been shipped. If the aforementioned agents are permanent, the competent authorities shall notify the Inspection Office in writing; if they are temporary, the competent authorities shall provide written proof.</p>
<p>The Order of Certification Will Be Determined According to the Urgency of Need</p>
<p>(5) The Hong Kong Station shall determine the order of shipment of public goods of government authorities according to the number of the public goods transportation voucher certified by the Inspection Office. (6) The Hong Kong Station shall only accept and transport ordinary commercial goods that are permitted to be imported by the central government or specially permitted to be imported by the central government and hold special permits. (7) The Hong Kong Station shall determine the order of shipment of ordinary commercial goods according to the number of the ordinary cargo transportation voucher certified by the Inspection Office. (8) The Inspection Office shall separately consider the urgency of domestic needs at any time to determine the order of certification for the items reported by the consignor, whether public goods or commercial goods. For example, for public goods, medical supplies shall be certified first; for commercial goods, daily necessities shall be certified first.</p>
<h3>100,000 Bags of Small Grain Rice Will Arrive at the End of the Month</h3>

The ship is expected to arrive at the port around the 25th of this month. However, whether the public warehouse rice will be sold at a flat price immediately after arriving in Shanghai, or temporarily stored in the warehouse, it is heard that the committee will make a decision again temporarily. It is also learned that the 40,000 bags of small grain rice purchased by various rice merchants in this city will also be shipped to Shanghai one after another within the month, so the future of the people's food in this city is indeed optimistic.</p>
<h3>The Passing of Elder Statesman Wang Dan Kui of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Memorial Service Held Today by Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Held at the Pudong Native Place Association at 2 PM, Dozens of Organizations Including the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Native Place Association Participating</p>
<p>Elder statesman Wang Dan Kui of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, was deeply admired throughout the country during his lifetime. After his passing in June of this year, his close friends, admiring his great virtues, prepared and initiated a memorial service to express their condolences. The association has already completed preparations and will hold a memorial service at 2 PM today in the grand auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association. It is reported that over thirty charitable, educational, and commercial organizations, including the World Red Swastika Society and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Native Place Association, will participate, and it is sure to be an occasion of great solemnity. The eulogies from various organizations and elegiac couplets from all walks of life are recorded below:</p>
<p>Portrait of Mr. Wang Dan Kui</p>
<p>Eulogy</p>
<p>On this, the fourteenth day of September in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, at this memorial service, we, the representatives of all the participating organizations, Tang Wenzhi, Shen Wei, Wen Lanting, Jiang Weiqiao, Shen Enfu, Shi Zhaozeng, Ye Erkai, Chen Taoyi, Huang Qinglan, Ding Fubao, Guan Jiong, Zhang Yipeng, Zhao Xi'en, Li Xidun, Lu Ruiqing, Yao Minghui, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhu Shaowen, Jin Qiyuan, Feng Yangxian, Zai Boqi, Chen Chen, Li Dixian, Pan Weibing, Miao Yonglou, Zhang Kangpei, Qu Cengze, Lu Jia, Du Tingzhen, Gu Nanqun, and others, respectfully offer incense, silk, wine, and libations to the spirit of the honorable Wang Dan Kui, saying: In learning, you sought the Way; in serving, you achieved merit. The Way is vast in substance; merit is grand in application. Uniting knowledge and action, you responded to circumstances without end. You inherited strict teachings, pursuing righteousness and reason. You studied the teachings of Cheng and Zhu, and the similarities and differences with Lu and Wang. Transforming empty words into practical use, you expanded outward while remaining rooted within. When you were in the central government, you stood upright in court, tirelessly devoted. Agriculture, commerce, foreign affairs, finance, and transportation all benefited from your sense of justice, prioritizing righteousness over profit, and sincerity over deception. You treated the virtuous with exceptional favor, while the powerful masked their exclusion with promotion. Although your official career ended with an external appointment, your upright reputation reached the emperor's ears. When you were in the localities, you valued agriculture and cherished grain, facilitated commerce and benefited workers. You leveraged the rich resources of the Taihu region to alleviate the suffering of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. You exhausted your mind and body in diligent labor, personally walking the fields in the south and east. Surpassing Yu the Great's eight years of toil, you dedicated your entire life to the task. Though projects were sometimes hampered by economic constraints, your plans were comprehensive and detailed. Success need not originate from oneself; careful planning illuminates like a new dawn. When you were among your fellow villagers, you were diligent in production and frugal in consumption, living simply and modestly. You treated all equally, from spring planting to autumn harvest. You found joy in bamboo, trees, flowers, birds, fish, and insects. You established agricultural farms to promote male farming and set up yarn factories to improve female handicraft. The source of food and clothing was abundant, and the way of teachers and scholars flourished. Your lectures filled every space in your halls, and your books overflowed your library. Rejecting the frivolous language of poetry, you compiled collections of essays on statecraft. You left behind writings to pass down to your descendants. With your turban, everyone had a path to follow; with your painted fan, every household had a Fang Weng. In regulating yourself, you were like jade in the rough, like hemp growing upright. You valued diligence over laziness, and thrift over extravagance. You were purer than the waters of Jian Lake, and loftier than the paulownia trees of Dragon Gate. You were never ashamed of your peers, and you never felt guilty before heaven. Thus, your conduct transformed the stubborn and inspired the weak. Your words awakened the deaf and enlightened the ignorant. In dealing with others, you commanded respect upon sight and approached with humility. You were like the warm breeze of a spring terrace and the gentle rain of Dongshan. Overseas Chinese wept at your sight, and even barbarians were moved to harmony. You believed that those from afar would come and those nearby would be pleased, without distinguishing between the wise and the foolish. Some of us relied on your support, some were sheltered by your protection, some clung to you like vines on a pine, and some were shaped by your guidance and refinement. We lament the passing of this great elder, our hearts heavy with sorrow. We remember your full life of blessings, your father serene and harmonious. We pray, "A hero among thousands, a leader among ten thousands. May your reputation be as enduring as the mountains and rivers. Enjoy this offering."</p>
<p>Elegiac Couplets</p>
<p>(1) Standing upright in court, never flattering, skillfully managing and enriching agriculture and commerce, Jiangsu mourns your passing. Heaven suddenly envious, your model should be enshrined in the local temple, the people grieving in their hearts. Protecting road rights, skillfully managing water conservancy, Guanzhong compares to Zheng Bai. The mountain collapses, where do we look? The masses together wipe away tears. (Jiang Weiqiao, President of Chengming College) Heaven does not spare, the model is suddenly lost, literature is not yet lost, the teachings are always new, (Li Zhaohuan) the same Sun Shiyu neighborhood, the Jiangsu style is now exhausted, there is Qi Shangshu reputation, the township evaluation still exists, (Mao Guangsheng) the market court remains hidden, the country loses a sage, (Guan Jiong) Southeast lost an old man, behavior enough for thousands of years, (Hu Pu'an) Noon traces celebrities, achievements, articles are immortal, Spring Shen long hidden, death of man and country have the same grief, (Wen Lanting) Great Shou eighty-two years old, tooth virtue both promote Jijiu, Juqu 30,000 hectares, facilities are only Yang Yimo, (Huang Qinglan)</p>

<h3>George Liddell Visits the American Consulate to Discuss Concession Administration</h3>
<p>Deliberation on the Selection of Members for the Advisory Committee, Negotiations on the Western District Tax Loss Not Yet Concluded</p>
<p>The British Consul-General in Shanghai, George, accompanied by Liddell, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), visited the American Consul-General, Lockhead, at the American Consulate at 11 AM on the 10th, for a lengthy discussion lasting an hour. This event is considered very important by all parties. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, George and Liddell visited Lockhead to discuss issues related to the administration of the concessions. Organizing an advisory committee and deliberating on the selection of its members is one of the issues under discussion. Since the SMC decided to levy a special property tax at its meeting on the 3rd of this month, it must obtain the approval of the advisory committee before it can begin levying the tax next year.</p>
<p>Dual Demand for Taxes in the Western District</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, Mr. Hori, stated at a press conference yesterday (the 12th) that residents of roads outside the Shanghai Western District may have to pay taxes to both the SMC and the city center. Previously, a reporter asked about residents in the Hongqiao Road area who had been asked by tax collectors from both sides for property tax and car license fees. The Japanese spokesman explained the situation, saying that the city center seems to believe that it is qualified to collect various taxes and has sent people to collect them. The dispute over roads outside the concession has not been resolved, as both sides insist on their right to collect taxes in this area. "Therefore, he does not know how residents in the area outside the concession can avoid paying taxes to both sides," he said.</p>
<p>Negotiations Still in Progress</p>
<p>A reporter said that these residents have even received warnings that if they do not pay taxes to the city center, they will not be allowed to use their cars. The spokesman replied that it is natural that car owners who do not pay the license fee are not allowed to drive. Negotiations between the two sides are still in progress to resolve these issues, he said. According to an SMC official,</p>
<p>Three Districts Will Use a Joint License</p>
<p>The proposal to resolve the outstanding issues such as the Western District taxes and to jointly use car licenses in the three districts has made progress in the negotiations between the two sides since Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the SMC, returned to Shanghai from vacation. When the reporter asked about rumors that the results of the tax negotiations could be decided in writing next month, the official stated that the talks between the two sides have not yet concluded, so it is impossible to predict when an agreement will be reached. According to the plan for a joint license in the three districts, car owners do not need to obtain separate licenses for the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District. They only need to obtain one license to travel in these three districts.</p>
<h3>No Such Thing as Expanding Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, although the need for telephones is currently very urgent in all industries in the city, the supply of raw materials has been affected by the war and cannot be replenished. There is no truth to the rumors that the company has shipped a portion of the materials to Shanghai and is actively expanding its lines, and that new users can apply for installation and be connected next month.</p>
<h3>Dredging Smaller Riverbanks</h3>
<p>The Huangpu River and other smaller riverbanks have not been dredged since the end of the war, resulting in silt accumulation and rising riverbeds, which is one of the reasons for water accumulation on the roads. The SMC Works Department has hired workers to dredge the smaller riverbanks. Last month, a total of 0.3883 kilometers of riverbanks were dredged, and 10,220 cubic feet of silt were removed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Shot in Hongkou, Seriously Wounded in the Chest</h3>
<p>Three passersby were injured by stray bullets, bridge closures restored at noon</p>
<p>At around 10:30 AM yesterday, another shooting of Japanese soldiers occurred in the Hongkou District. After the incident, in addition to imposing security measures and searching the area, all bridges over the Suzhou Creek were temporarily closed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shot Three Times</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, a Japanese Navy Private First Class, Kusuhara Kunio (30 years old), was walking from the Marine Corps headquarters, intending to go to a certain place on Fair Road for official business. Unexpectedly, when he passed a deserted area on Fair Road near Zhoujiazui Road, five assassins suddenly jumped out from the roadside and opened fire on Kusuhara. Kusuhara was unable to dodge and was hit three times, all in the chest. He immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assassins fled without a trace.</p>
<p>Passersby Injured</p>
<p>The Huishan Police Station and the Japanese military police authorities received the news and immediately dispatched personnel to the scene of the incident, first cutting off traffic and conducting a major search, but to no avail. They then sent the wounded soldier to a Japanese military hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger. It was also discovered that stray bullets injured three passersby during the shooting, including: (1) Su Gaoxing (33 years old, local resident, residing at 895 Zhoujiazui Road), the bullet entered from the back and penetrated deep into the abdomen, also seriously injured; (2) Yu Chuanqi (25 years old, Chongming native, residing at 922 Chengcheng Lane, Zhoujiazui Road), injured in the right leg; (3) Miao Shiyu (25 years old, Changzhou native), injured in the abdomen. All were summoned by car and sent to Shanghai Convalescent Hospital for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Bridge Closures</p>
<p>After the incident, in addition to imposing temporary martial law in the area where the incident occurred and searching for the assassins, the Japanese side also closed all bridges over the Suzhou Creek, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from entering or leaving. Even Japanese residents were not allowed to pass freely. The strictness of the security was unprecedented. It was not until around 11 AM that the bridges were reopened. It was also learned that the Zhonghong Bridge in the Hongkou District would also be closed after 3 PM, but only Chinese residents were prohibited from passing. Japanese and foreign nationals were still allowed to pass. As of the time of writing, there has been no progress in the above-mentioned bloody case.</p>
<h3>Armed Thugs Arrested, Reportedly Plotted to Harm a Factory Owner</h3>
<p>The French Concession patrol team, while inspecting hotels on Avenue Edward VII the previous night, spotted two suspicious men who ducked into an alley. They were immediately arrested, and a pistol and six bullets were found on them. According to their confession, they were instigated by someone to harm a certain businessman residing in the French Concession in order to settle a private grudge. The pistol found was stolen from a Sikh constable on Chengdu Road on April 5. The police are currently investigating the case in order to crack the mastermind behind the crime.</p>
<p>The Shewen News Agency reported that at around 11 PM on the night of the 12th, patrol officers from the French Concession Police Department arrested a young man in a long gown at the entrance of Alley 17 on Rue Molière, and found a six-shot pistol and more than ten bullets. According to his confession, his name is Han Yugen, 22 years old, a native of Pudong, and he admitted that he intended to assassinate Zhu Zujun (47 years old), a Ningbo native and the owner of the Jincheng Tin Foil Factory at No. 2, Alley 116, Dongxinqiao Street. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation based on his confession and are also hunting for the mastermind.</p>
<h3>Japanese Arrest Six Men and Women in the French Park, Another Attempt to Arrest Someone in Avenue Haig Fails</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese requested the French Concession Police Department to assign Chinese and Western detectives to accompany them in two cars, No. 381 and No. 10207, to the French Park on Route Vallon, to arrest a person. As a result, the person was not arrested and left. At around 10:15 AM, the Japanese and the police personnel went to the French Park for the second time and arrested five Chinese men and one woman, all over the age of 20, apparently young students. They were taken to the French Concession Police Department and interrogated. It is said that they were immediately extradited by the Japanese to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in Hongkou. At around 5 PM the day before yesterday, personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, accompanied by the French Concession Police Department, sent detectives to Apartment No. 3, No. 76 Avenue Haig, to arrest a person, but were unsuccessful. It is reported that the person residing in the apartment was impersonating a member of the Japanese Military Police and swindling people outside. The Japanese side recently discovered this and intended to arrest him for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Huizhang Abducted Yesterday</h3>
<p>An abduction case suddenly occurred at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Shanxi Road in the International Settlement at around 3 PM yesterday. The abducted person's name is Wang Huizhang, 23 years old, from Sheng County, Zhejiang. He was a technician at the Meiya Silk Factory on Tianjin Road. This year, he established his own Huixin Weaving Factory on Jiaozhou Road, a small scale, and served as the factory director himself. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the Meiya Factory to visit a friend when he was suddenly abducted by three kidnappers, all armed with pistols. They kidnapped Wang, forced him into a car that was parked on the roadside, and sped away, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Butcher Shop Robbed, Accomplice Betrays Gang, Large Number of Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM on the 9th of this month, five robbers suddenly arrived at the Hongxingshun Butcher Shop at No. 13 Rue Chapsal, two of them armed with pistols. They robbed the shop of 1,300 yuan in cash and fled. The owner reported the incident to the French Concession Police Department. After investigation by Chinese Inspector Qin Youyu, Dai Rongji, Detective Zhang Dongcheng, and Detectives Chen Fusheng, Zhou Qingfang, and Wang Baolin, they suspected that Zhou Bingsheng (29 years old), a native of Jiaxing and an employee of the shop, was involved. After investigation, it was discovered that Zhou was indeed an insider.

<h3>Charity Tea Dance to Raise Funds for the Children's Home Today</h3>
<p>Starting at 4:30 PM at the Lido Garden, All-Shanghai Red Star Volunteer Dance Partners, Tickets Ten Yuan, 500 Children to Perform Arts Programs</p>
<p>Since Mr. Gao Huailiang became the Director of the Shanghai Children's Home in March of this year, he has spared no effort in rectifying the affairs of the Home. He is deeply concerned about the physical health and intellectual development of all the children in the Home. He has also worked hard to raise more than 200,000 yuan for the expansion of the Home and the purchase of decorations. However, there are more than 500 children in the Home, and the expenses are enormous. Moreover, with the prices of all goods soaring, the average monthly fee for each child is approximately 55 yuan. The total monthly expenses of the Home exceed 25,000 yuan. Among them, the largest expenditure is for rice, which accounts for almost half of the total amount. Therefore, the large amount of donations from major benefactors over the past six months has been almost exhausted. Furthermore, the Home has no foundation funds or subsidies from any source. With the autumn wind rising and the weather gradually turning cold, the winter clothing for the entire Home urgently needs to be purchased. Therefore, with the support of social celebrities and enthusiastic benefactors, a charity tea dance to raise funds has been initiated and will be held at the Lido Garden on Route Mestre on the 14th (today) starting at 4:30 PM. At the same time, all the Red Star volunteer dance partners in Shanghai have been specially invited. More than 80 people have agreed, and a portion of the Red Stars will also join in today. Tickets are ten yuan per person and include a complimentary refreshment. All 500 children from the Home will be present to perform various music and art programs. Order booklets will be distributed in the venue. The detailed income and expenditure of Mr. Gao's tenure are listed to ensure credibility. It is also heard that this tea dance has received strong support from all sectors, and the presale of tickets has reached more than 150,000 yuan. At that time, the Lido Garden will be the scene of an unprecedented charity tea dance.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Old Toys for Poor Children</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>Any child, upon hearing the word "toy," welcomes it without exception. Indeed, toys are a wonderful thing. They can walk, run, call out, jump, move, and smile... they are simply like real things, and even more adorable and fun than real things.</p>
<p>Dear children, I believe you must have many lovely toys at home. Moreover, your parents love you dearly and often buy toys displayed in the windows of large department stores, giving them to you to play with after you come home from school, making you smile and feel extremely happy. You are truly blessed! But do you know how many poor children stand in front of those windows, gazing blankly at the toys? They love toys just as much as you do, but they are unfortunate enough to be born into poor families, where they cannot even get enough to eat, let alone have any money to buy toys. They can only stand in front of the windows, staring blankly, and they truly envy you for having toys and being able to go to school.</p>
<p>When you get tired of playing with old toys, or they break, you throw them into a corner, and your parents buy you a new and more fun one to play with. Your parents are wonderful, and you should study hard to repay them. But have you ever thought about those poor children who are not fortunate enough to have toys? They are also someone's children, and they don't even have a single old toy to play with. Do you feel sorry for them? Now, you have a great opportunity to make use of your old toys, which is to share these old toys with poor children so that everyone can play together. You may think that old toys are not much fun? That doesn't matter. Now, there is a Rotary Club toy hospital that is requesting old toys from dear children, whether they are old or broken. After they repair them, they will distribute them to poor children. So, please hurry up and search in the corners of the walls or under the beds for old toys and ask your parents to send them to the Madi Motor Company at No. 640 Avenue Joffre, or call Mr. Mabo Le at No. 13016, and they will send someone to collect them. They will be very grateful, and dear children, you will have done a good deed! I wish you good health and more toys!</p>
<h3>Do Not Fail Those Who Support You</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>To my dearest children! Do you know? I am envying you, praising you! You, you, you are truly the favored children of heaven! You, you, you are truly blessed with happiness! You, you...</p>
<p>How fortunate you are, having food to eat, clothes to wear, and books to read. But have you considered? How your fathers, your mothers, are tirelessly working, all for your sake.</p>
<p>Especially now, when the cost of living has reached extreme levels; rice, coal briquettes, rent... which one hasn't risen again and again? Under such circumstances, maintaining a family's bare minimum living is already extremely difficult, where would there be any strength left to support your schooling? Yet, your parents, unwilling to let you suffer the pain of dropping out of school, still reluctantly send you to school. If you still don't know how to study diligently, how will you face your parents?</p>
<p>The scholarship fund campaign of this newspaper is precisely for this reason. To the children who have received the grant! I can't help but congratulate you. You have not been hindered in your future by circumstances, you can still continue your studies, fulfilling your aspirations. Your future remains bright. Your future holds boundless hope. However, you should work even harder to live up to the earnest expectations of this newspaper and the donors.</p>
<p>Dear children! Now is the time to start working hard, do not fail those who help you, nurture you!</p>

<p>It's not the mild spring, nor the harsh winter, nor the sweltering summer, what is it? It is the cool autumn. Although the autumn weather is not as cold as winter, many trees, flowers, plants, insects, etc., cannot withstand the damage of frost, so they hide long before winter arrives. At this time, we can no longer hear the chirping of the katydid and grasshopper, but crickets come to take their place. We can often find them in grass heaps, at the foot of walls, or under flower pots. We catch crickets and keep them in pots to play with. Sometimes, everyone picks out the best ones and puts them together in a pot to fight. Crickets are good at fighting, so when two crickets meet, they fight each other. There is always a winner and a loser, and the winner is considered the king.</p>
<p>We only regard cricket fighting as a game; but now some people are using crickets as gambling stakes. Some people, because they cannot find the best cricket, often pay the highest price to buy one, or send people to find them everywhere. The amount they gamble is as high as several thousand yuan. Therefore, when autumn arrives, people are excited to raise crickets again, and compete fiercely with others. But we children should remember that it is absolutely unacceptable to use crickets for gambling.</p>
<h3>The Golden Beetle's Dream</h3>
<p>— Le Yue</p>
<p>The moon maiden rides a curved little boat,</p>
<p>Floating in the azure sea of the sky.</p>
<p>A beautiful little bug with golden armor,</p>
<p>Is falling deeply into a sweet dream.</p>
<p>It dreams of green leaves covering thick shade,</p>
<p>Red flowers spreading sweet fragrance,</p>
<p>It slowly climbs up the trunk to the branches,</p>
<p>To explore the glittering golden sunlight.</p>
<p>It also dreams of abundant golden fruits,</p>
<p>Hanging all over the trees.</p>
<p>Whether they are big or small, sweet or fragrant,</p>
<p>It eats and eats to its heart's content, tastes and tastes again.</p>
<p>It also dreams of the bright, clear moonlit night,</p>
<p>When the mischievous children have all gone to sleep,</p>
<p>It accompanies the grasshopper and katydid,</p>
<p>Playing beautiful music, how clear and bright.</p>
<p>Waking up, it opens its eyes and looks around,</p>
<p>Dead leaves are hanging on the branches, swaying,</p>
<p>The west wind brings cold;</p>
<p>The white dew brings desolation.</p>
<p>It looks at the bare branches,</p>
<p>No longer a place to settle down.</p>
<p>It only blames itself for indulging in enjoyment at the beginning, and that's why it ended up like this!</p>
<h3>The Uses of Sesame</h3>
<p>— Fangfang</p>
<p>Children probably all know what sesame is. Haven't you eaten sesame cakes or large flatbreads? The small things stuck on the bread are sesame seeds; also sesame oil, the oil squeezed from sesame seeds, is a very good seasoning when put in side dishes and in soup. Perhaps children have also seen sesame planted in the fields. The stalks are square, the leaves are round and pointed, with a sheen. In autumn, they bloom with white flowers, and the seeds that grow are of two kinds, black and white, which are black sesame and white sesame.</p>
<p>In our country, sesame is mostly used to extract oil. In addition to extracting oil, some of it is used for food, such as the sesame cakes, sesame candies, sesame brittle, etc. that we often eat.</p>
<p>At the same time, before the war, it was also a major agricultural export product. A lot of it was shipped to foreign countries every year. Italy, France, and Japan were all buying it in large quantities. Japan bought it to make seasoning, while France bought it to make perfume. As for Italy, they used our sesame to make gunpowder. It is said that the oil content in sesame is very high. After a certain amount of heat, the explosive power is very great. It is better than sulfur-based explosives for making burning and explosive materials. Don't catch crickets in dirty places! Made by Ni Changmin.</p>
<h3>Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>— Yingting</p>
<p>Rui'er saw in the newspaper that there would be a solar eclipse at noon on the 20th of this month. He was very happy, but he didn't know what a solar eclipse was, so he ran to ask his father.</p>
<p>"Dad! What is a solar eclipse? Can you tell me the reason for it?" "Solar eclipse? Okay! I'll tell you." His father took out a globe, a candle, and a round mirror in the room. First, he put the globe and the candle on the left and right sides of the table, and then said to Rui'er:</p>
<p>"People in ancient times regarded the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning in nature as unpredictable mysterious phenomena, thinking that gods were angry and showing off their power. This is not surprising in ancient times when knowledge was naive. They thought that a solar eclipse was a misfortune for the sun, a very unfortunate event; but in this enlightened 20th century, those unfounded superstitions have been broken by scientists and astronomers one by one." At this time, he lit the candle and continued, "Today, I will use the candle as the sun, the round mirror as the moon, and the globe as the earth." As he spoke, he inserted the round mirror in the middle of the candle and the globe, and then asked Rui'er, "Can you see the solar eclipse now?" Rui'er looked up at the sky, stunned like a wooden chicken. He saw the scorching sun high in the sky, and the heat was overwhelming. He thought, where did the solar eclipse come from? His father knew that he still didn't understand, so he pointed to the things on the table and said, "Look, this is the situation during a solar eclipse! If we look into the universe from the earth at this time, do you think we can see the entire sun?" Rui'er thought for a while and said with a smile, "Is it because the sun's light is blocked by the moon?" His father nodded and said, "That's right! Now you should understand. When the moon is between the sun and the earth, forming a straight line, it will form a solar eclipse; at the same time, because they are all rotating rapidly, their positions are constantly moving, so the time of the solar eclipse is very short."</p>
<p>"Dad! How long should it be?" Rui'er asked happily.</p>
<p>"Two hundred and two seconds, totaling only three minutes and twenty-two seconds!"</p>
<p>"Dad! Who discovered the principle of solar eclipse?" he kept asking.</p>
<p>"This was discovered by Thales, a famous Greek astronomer more than 500 years BC."</p>
<p>"Dad! He..." Rui'er was still asking questions when he suddenly heard his mother calling them to have lunch, thus interrupting their conversation.</p>
<h3>The Old Frog Who Overestimated Himself</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>An old frog was resting on a duckweed in a pond when his son suddenly ran over to him in a hurry and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, there is a huge cow over there, very, very big!"</p>
<p>"How big is it?" the old frog asked.</p>
<p>"Very, very big!"</p>
<p>After hearing this, the old frog drank a lot of water, making its belly very big, twice as big as before, and asked the little frog, "Am I as big as that?"</p>
<p>"Bigger than you!" the little frog replied.</p>
<p>The old frog drank some more water and asked, "How about this?"</p>
<p>"Still bigger than you!"</p>
<p>The old frog drank some more water: "How about this?"</p>
<p>"Still bigger than you!"</p>
<p>The old frog was extremely angry, so it drank as much as it could, as much as it could possibly drink.</p>
<p>"This way..." Before it could finish speaking, with a pop, its belly burst.</p>
<p>Children, what are your thoughts after reading the above story?</p>

<h3>Rambling Talk about the Amazing "Shouchun Pot"</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Contribution of Radio Broadcasting to Peking Opera</p>
<p>I have been broadcasting Peking Opera on various radio stations for four or five years, so I have a little understanding of the methods and order of broadcasting. Especially when it comes to special programs, such as gatherings of famous amateurs and famous actors, the number of people is large, and the order is extremely difficult to maintain. Once the order is chaotic, everything becomes rushed, and the program loses its brilliance. This is a common phenomenon. On the 10th of this month, Hongxiang Company held a large broadcast for advertising its business. The broadcasting of Peking Opera by the Damei Radio Station gathered almost all the famous amateurs and actors in Shanghai. I was also dragged by a friend to sing "Sangyuan Jizi," the "Tan Xiongdi" and "Jian Fentai" sections, facing the air. Zeng Xinzhai and Jin Shaogang were on the drums and playing the instruments, respectively, and they were both considered good hands in the martial arts and literary circles of the amateur scene. The report by comedian Zhang Yezhi was especially energetic. My singing inevitably lost its skill. There might be a sentence or two that was listenable, but suddenly I felt powerless, and I felt that I didn't sing well. In addition, the broadcasting room was smoky and crowded with people, and some people were talking and laughing next to me. Sometimes they even touched the head of the broadcasting machine, making it tremble as if it was about to fall to the ground and take a break. The place in the room was originally not big, but it was filled with many people for ten hours. Inside, it was so hot that it seemed like you could cook an egg. Once you went in, you felt difficulty breathing, so few people could sing comfortably. I received preferential treatment from the company and the friends who handled the matter, and I am definitely not writing this article to satirize out of dissatisfaction. I am writing this because every time there is a big broadcast, especially of Peking Opera, there are such phenomena. Every time it is so chaotic, everyone feels uncomfortable, so I am now offering my humble opinions to all parties involved in future big broadcasts of Peking Opera. Before a big broadcast of Peking Opera, the stage manager and the heads of each group should pay close attention. The number of people broadcasting should not be too many, and the broadcasting time for each person must be accurate. The order should not be changed. Although not absolute, it is relative. In the broadcasting room, except for the staff, the stage crew, and the person broadcasting at the time, visits should be absolutely refused. The announcer should speak less, and the sentences that need to be conveyed should also be said once every fifteen minutes or ten minutes. What is even more important is that a certain amateur group or a certain small group should be invited to sing a duet or a scene from a play, which would be more interesting and save time. Someone might ask: How can the time be accurate? I say: You have to use a car to pick them up. For groups, you can use a large truck, which is also fine. Go to pick them up at the appointed time, and after a short stop, they can sing, so there will be fewer people who go early on their own. Someone might say: Wouldn't the transportation costs be very high? I say: Amateurs practice for a year, two years, ten years, twenty years, and some even have forty years of experience. It is not set up for people to earn money, so even if it costs gasoline, it does not seem to hurt frugality.</p>
<h3>Watching Charity Performances at the Russian Theater</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xiangyi</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Zhang hosted a charity rehearsal to raise educational loan funds, which was performed at the Russian Theater. At the invitation of a friend, I arrived at the theater around 7 o'clock. From the "Tiao Jia Guan" (a traditional auspicious opening act) to "Cosmic Front," a total of seven plays were performed. The first was "Nanyang Pass." The singing, accompaniment, drums, and huqin in this play were all terrible. Then "Saving the Emperor at Phoenix Mountain" had no good points to mention. Then came "Scolding the Emperor." "Scolding the Emperor" is a very common play, but Mr. Sun Songling's performance that evening was quite extraordinary. With his ability to calm down, he was best suited to play imperial hat dramas. In terms of singing skills, although he only used the "Ruan Liu Zi" tune, the slow tempo, high tempo, and the original tempo in two sections were sung in order, tirelessly. In terms of melody and words, he strictly followed the rules. (According to Mr. Fan Shiren, a friend of Mr. Sun, who talked about the play.) It is not easy to achieve such results in a debut work. Miss Zhang Yuhua, a senior disciple of the retired female performer Hong Xuefang, played Empress He. (See copper figure) This was also her first time performing this play. Miss Zhang is young and beautiful, with a graceful figure. Her voice is bright and high, and her movements are delicate and not charming. She is also a promising talent. After "Scolding the Emperor," "Visiting the Mother" was performed. Mr. Chen Yi played Si Lang, and Miss Qiu Yiming played the Princess. Although the tones were high and low, the singing was very stable. Miss Qiu's expression was particularly profound. Unfortunately, the two amateur musicians playing the huqin and erhu were always out of tune, unable to help Miss Qiu, which was a great loss. The closing performance was "Cosmic Front" by the famous amateur Mr. Li Baosun, a play with heavy singing and acting. Mr. Li performed more and more exquisitely, which is gratifying. The young male role was played by Mr. Li Shiwen, a former famous amateur in Nanjing. Mr. Li's movements were admirable. Although Mr. Li is a new friend of mine, I have seen him many times in the Qingchang (solo singing) arena. He has deeply mastered the Mei School's style of play. I didn't expect to see him on stage and see such amazing results.</p>
<h3>Matchmaker</h3>
<p>— Shasha</p>
<p>The Yan Zhou marriage change, which caused a stir for a while and gave people material for conversation, has now passed and is gradually being forgotten. However, because both parties have considerable history and connections in the singing world, a new song that describes the process of their love and marriage, "Matchmaker," was created by Chen Dongsun writing the lyrics and Yao Min composing the music, and it has been widely sung, becoming a remnant of this event. Now, with the consent of Mr. Chen, I am transcribing the original lyrics as follows for readers who love to sing.</p>
<p>The clever and beautiful little matchmaker (Zhou's nickname is Xiaohong) learned to sing from a young age. She has an affectionate lover, who is young, strong, and ambitious. One loves her for her elegance, and the other loves him for his generosity. The seeds of love grow, and artistic partners get married. Who knows that the river of love has many waves, and from then on, the lovers find it difficult to stay together.</p>
<p>Heaven is jealous of that little matchmaker, and an unwarranted misunderstanding caused disaster. They forget the old days in a fit of pique. The matchmaker angrily leaves him. One is as if drunk, and the other wanders everywhere. Both think quietly, and share a long relationship of nine years. Clouds cover the moon are also common, and it is not difficult to reunite the broken mirror.</p>
<p>The resolute little matchmaker is unwilling to lower her head to obey her lover, and even reports her grievances to the newspapers. The marriage change of the matchmaker spread everywhere. One says he is slandering, and the other says she is frivolous. Both refuse to give in to each other. The mandarin ducks will never be together again. They put aside the old love like a dream, and are willing to strive for glory in their careers. (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>Bloody Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 16 Taking a Pet Bird Out of Its Cage Early</p>
<p>Tian Hongyu raised a glass to celebrate his birthday, and San Gui also returned the toast. He glanced over and saw a beautiful woman among the concubines, with light makeup and elegant clothes, playing the pipa, sitting in the middle. She often spoke before the rest of the ensemble, like the leader of the female music band. Her feelings were charming and delicate, completely different from her peers. Her bright eyes were charming, and her gentle feelings were clear, like a fairy from Yaotai. He couldn't help but feel his heart flutter and his mind wander, and he began to fantasize. So he instructed someone to call the bodyguard in and open the luggage he brought with him, taking out a set of casual clothes to change into. He immediately took off his military uniform, just like Yang Shuzi, who used to wear light fur and a loose belt when he was young. Tian Hongyu couldn't help but secretly praise him. The concubines were also secretly turning their eyes, admiring the elegant demeanor of the general. Wu Yigui had also been staring at the beautiful woman in light makeup for a long time, and couldn't help but point at her and ask Tian Hongyu, "Is this beauty Chen Yuanyuan from Jiangnan? She is truly a beauty who can overthrow a country, rare in the world. The imperial father-in-law is very lucky to have her." Tian Hongyu didn't want to answer anything, he just nodded and smiled at him, saying, "The general's judgment is indeed correct." San Gui then asked Tian Hongyu to have Yuanyuan play a pipa piece alone. Tian Hongyu then asked Yuanyuan to play a solo for General Wu. Yuanyuan agreed in a charming voice and turned the pegs and plucked the strings, playing a piece of "High Mountain and Flowing Water," which Tian Hongyu usually listened to, loud and clear, like pearls falling on a jade plate, gentle and affectionate. San Gui listened attentively, while Hongyu tapped the beat with his chopsticks. Tonight, Yuanyuan played the pipa with even more hand movements and eye expressions, with a wonderful and transcendent skill. After the song was played, the lingering sound was still lingering, making people feel relaxed and fascinated. San Gui then asked Tian Hongyu, "Yuanyuan is the leader of the singing and dancing troupe in the imperial father-in-law's mansion. She must be able to dance like Feiyan. Can you have Yuanyuan dance so that the young master can broaden his horizons?" Tian Hongyu naturally couldn't refuse, so he ordered Yuanyuan to dance. Yuanyuan tidied her sleeves, lightly moved her lotus steps, and walked to the front of the banquet. An maid walked over and handed her two pheasant feathers. (170)</p>
