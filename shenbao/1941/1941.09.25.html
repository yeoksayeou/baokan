<h3>中日形勢與湘北之戰</h3>
<p>中日間的形勢　自從武漢會戰告一段落而後，日方似即已失却以武力爲唯一解決手段的信心，戰塲上的交綏、也很少有決定性的進退，因之在若干人心目中，其對於戰事的注意力，無形已隨着時日代序而冲淡，代替了這一地位的。到是歐戰進退與美日關係一類的問題。在今日中國際問，誠然不能否認各種因素之間的密切關聯和影響，何况中日問題又正是其間重要的一環；不過國際間的變動，固能影響遠東事件的前途。中國的進退，也未嘗不足以左右世界動向；這一點，正是四年來最可寳貴的收穫，今日的事態。已絕不容用疇昔的陳舊眼光去衡量。中日間的戰事，是中日兩國休戚所關，但更是國際大局安危所繫。中國作戰之所以受到世界的推崇與援助，羅斯福總統且以美國之偉大國防相稱譽，除却基於正義的認識而外，實應該從這種關聯去索解。</p>
<p>日本之於中日問題，因爲絀於實力的緣故，在近三數年中總是更着重於軍事以外的手段，其年來之侈談南進，固然是爲滿足擴展慾望，但在另一方面，也正不失其爲「解決中日事件」的步驟之一。在若干日人心目中。似乎始終未能深刻體認中國內在的民族偉力。而總是把中國的作戰認爲友邦援助之功，是以乃有能解決英美關係則對華戰爭即自然解決的見解，從前年的反英運動到最近的對美談判，多少都是以此一認識爲出發點。殊不知任何友邦，決不會迫使中國屈服，中國的堅定立塲，也不是國際間何等波動所能左右；此數年間，有過東京的英日協定，也有過滇越路與滇緬路的封鎖。那些艱苦逆境，都迄未能絲毫動搖中國堅定的心志，這種情形，也許在第三國家比較日本更看得淸。是以如果日本進行美日談判的主要用意是在於希望由美國的中介俾使「中日事變」獲得解決，則此一談判之毫無結果實不足異。東京軍部發言人之悍然表示「決計無論有何反對，必進行對華戰爭貫澈到底」，是日當局內心蘊蓄的透露，也是對美外交運用失敗後憤懣的發洩。南進呼聲曾經用以濟對華戰爭之窮，在南進碰壁之餘。也必然又會再度嘗試在中國的軍事冒險，即使那未必眞能收穫何等效果，至少亦可藉以炫耀於國際間，表示日本還具有足以威脅中國的實力。如能倖而獲逞，那自然更是連年相持中的重大收穫，這大槪也就是其此度在湘北大舉進犯的原因。</p>
<p>依照近四年來的慣例，每値秋風正厲之際，日重輙在湘北有所行動：廿七年武漢淪陷以後，日軍曾一度進抵長沙附近、卒賴華軍作戰得力，始獲轉危爲安；廿八年秋，日方又結集將近廿萬主力部隊，由湘北分途猛犯，但結果到造成了華軍的大捷；只有去歲，因爲日方正銳意謀南進並擾中國東南沿海，在湘北不曾大規模進犯，但小的接觸却不斷發生，而中日兩軍，三年來亦始終隔着新墻河水相持。論湘北地勢，由岳州以至長沙·鐵路公路兩側地勢平坦、無險可守，另一方面，則湘江洞庭的水道，適形成了由岳州到長沙最便於日軍行動的通路。這一易攻難守的地形，正是適合於日方此際避重就輕的標準的。假如長沙不守，則衡陽亦危，因而南中國縱橫交通的樞紐亦將遭受重大威脅，這固然絕沒有解決中日戰事的決定意義，在日方却可能以較少代價獲致多方面的收穫。此一戰事，自本月七日在臨湘岳州之間的大雲山發動後，十八日轉爲新牆河南的止面接觸。到廿日後，日軍已被阻於汨水兩岸，在慘烈　激戰中是華軍得到重大的勝利，但日方又復運用延翼包抄的陳舊戰略，一方以數百艦艇進窺洞庭南岸的營田湘陰、一方由汨水東進圖襲平江。此次日軍動員部隊僅及前歲湘北戰役之半，而且還是由各個戰地抽調而來。在戰略上也沒有新穎的運用和部署，則以銳勢方張的華軍，於此當可收駕輕就熟之效，但此役之於內外各方旣具重大意義，華軍的截擊應戰，自亦不容有絲毫的輕忽。</p>
<p>雖然日本在今日已沒有以武力解決中日事件的實力與決心，而軍事上的勝利則始終爲中國完成作戰目標的唯一途徑，只有這樣，纔能發揮中國對於國際正義與未來和平的偉大貢獻，而且也止是一切反侵略的國家和人民所期望於中國。在國際間，即使還有某種陰翳的存在，中國在軍事上的重大成就必足以使之消釋於無形。</p>

<h3>史太林希特勒對照</h3>
<p>史太林做到獨裁，由于秉性堅忍，毫無顧惜，善使挑撥離間的手段，而尤能利用時機。他以列寗爲一己的模範，引導的明星，可是列寗很知道史太林的弱點。據史自己晚，一次列寗曾提起他道，「此人性情粗暴而有大慾，他或將因此使黨分裂」。其後史太林果如所言，但他並不使黨分裂，而將黨內反對派完全肅淸，以致共產黨中央委員會，大會主席團，海陸軍首領，外交界人員，政府委員和各部主任，以及工廠經理和國民生活的各部份領袖，四分之三皆在失蹤之列，或爲自身及國家利益而去職。</p>
<p>有一句法國俗語說，人各有其品性上的缺點。在史太林至少有其缺點上的品性。他是個堅强固執猜忌自信的人，他從未有一時片刻忽略了蘇聯國際關係上的兩個基本因素。他永遠戒備着外來的攻擊，而竭盡腦力，不顧艱難困苦，以整頓蘇俄內部，在經濟上和工業上接濟現代戰爭的需要。</p>
<p>這些缺點是否和他的品性互相抵消，却不易說。美國人看到亞洲人常用以使人效忠和團結統一的方法，不免爲之驚詫。帖木兒是死于正寢的，他所征服的地方，比亞力山大尤多，然而他也是一個暴戾恣唯的人。因此一班相信人類有慷慨惻隱之心和人生的神聖者不免要悵然若失了。</p>
<p>希特勒也是不顧一切的人，然而他至今還是成功的。在這一點上他和史太林確能互相媲美。</p>
<p>不過據我想來，在世人眼光中，或以爲道兩人的行徑，未免大相徑庭。希特勒有時不惜孤注　擲，而史太林則慣于取巧。此言我不敢信以爲實。希特勒祗冒過一次大險，像拿破崙在維地橋一樣。實則古來名人，並不眞正冒險，拿破崙曾在獲得奧斯德里茲一役空前大勝之前，寫明他的部下，將樂聞主帥在此役中坐鎭後方，從事調度，而並不躬冒矢石。他在所發布的命令中曾經道樣說過，而此役所獲光輝的戰績，亦爲歐洲史上所僅見。</p>
<p>希特勒會於一九二三年在慕尼克僥倖冒險過一次，當時他和手下一小隊在妄之徒，合計不過二十人，爲密集的子彈截斷去路，希特勒的倖而得脫，眞是間不容髮。自此以後，他就謀定而後動，不再任意冒險了。他並非一意孤行，他成功的關鍵，即在事先有精細縝密的準備。</p>
<p>希特勒就是德國，他代表着德國人民的靈魂。我確信這是眞的，而希特勒的被視爲天神化身，其秘密也在這裏。俄國童話中述一巨人，天下無敵，因爲他的生命，不在體中，而別有寄託，敵人百覓小獲，所以無法殺他。直至最後一日，那個神話中的英雄，尋出他的生命所在，方能把他置諸死地。據說這巨人的生命是藏在鴨蛋裏而，那個所謂英雄的小孩子把蛋壓碎，便打倒了這巨人。希特勒的生命也是藏在蛋裏，而這蛋却在德意志鷹的體內。我這意思是說，他的生命就是德國人民的生命，他不是像我們一樣的凡人，而是日耳　主義具體計劃的　徵。</p>
<p>史太林是俄羅斯的代表人嗎？我想我們若要否認，尙須加以考慮。俄國人的堅靭性，較之讀過杜斯多夫斯基和柴霍甫小說所能想像的尤甚。你要了解俄國，就該閱讀普希金的著作，或托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」。就蘇俄全國人民說，他們是聰明狡猾，而隱藏在富裕的假面具後面，他們對於朋友並不可靠，而對於仇敵却永遠不會忘記。史太林的爲人也是這樣，可是我們若要估計他與俄國的關係，我們又不得不舊事重提，問一問俄國是歐洲的還是亞洲的？答案却是一兩面都是的」。我現在可以說史太林是代表着俄國的亞洲方面，而不是俄國的唯一要素，如希特勒是德國的唯一要素一般。（完）</p>

<h3>怎樣研究今日的中國地理（三）</h3>
<p>— 譚廉</p>
<p>要到夏秋間、完成川滇鐵路（即叙昆路）滇境一段、說已從昆明通到宣威、一說通通到曲靖、未知孰是、川黔鐵路已通柳江到德勝一段、隴海鐵路續通寳鷄到天水一段、水路的黔江、經整理後川黔間已通航、閩江已積極修治、沙溪永安寗化間、完成水壩九座、航道暢通、這是交通方面應當研究的、</p>
<p>戰後導淮委員會西移入川、協助西南改進水利建設、與川黔滇水利機關及省府合作、對於灌漑區城、實施查勘、盡量設計、結果已有瘠地二百十六萬五千畝、變成良田、預計一二年後、築渠工程次第完成、還可增加良田二百七十萬畝、其他陝西的郿惠渠、灌漑農田一萬三千餘畝、織女渠、灌漑農田一萬餘畝、（涇惠渠渭惠渠灌田最廣因非戰事後完成不計）甘肅的洮惠渠、灌漑農田三萬餘畝、道是水利方面應當硏究的、</p>
<p>作戰全靠經濟力生產力、方能支拄、農業生產、從自由區實施灌漑後、良田之增加、已見水利節、可見農產量的增加、但是米麥等產量、均無正確統計可資比較、廣西省產棉素少、民國二十六年祗有八萬七千擔、二十八年產十萬五千擔、二十九年增加到五十五萬二千七百擔、曠地荒田、都已關爲棉田、川湘二省、二十六年產棉約一百餘萬擔、二十九年相等、礦產素來著名的、是江西的鵭、湖南的銻、雲南的錫銅、貴州的水銀、作戰後鎢砂產量加以統制、已從一萬二千噸增加到二萬噸、</p>

<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅挺之氣續升、首盤即跳爲一千七百六十六元、此價一開塲、一致在喊要進、少頃即升至一千七百七十五元、然某大戶乘勢吐出、檯面帶鬆、繼聞廣幫交易雖不及上日之踴躍、然仍辦四百包以外、所以人心尙堪維持、在一千七百七十二元、曾見一度廻旋、迨十一時以後、取引所收盤忽落七八元至十元外、人氣怠懈、且傳棉紗有禁止出口說、賣勢頓盛、一疲即達一千七百五十三元收盤、但收盤以後、賣聲忽振、直下至一千七百三十八元資不出也、查半日間成交統計一萬零四百十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>美貸棉廉售之影響　將使整個棉市低落</h3>

<h3>售票員不揩油</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>這幾天來，上海人誰不談起電車售票員揩油推斃乘客的事呢？那天剛巧有一位留美回來的朋友在塲，我打趣地同他說：「美國的售票員揩油不揩油呢？」不料他回答說，「美國公共車輛的售票員是絕不揩油的！」我吃了一驚，以爲這位朋友也加人「外國月亮好」的集團了，正想加以責難的時候，他繼續說，「因爲他們不能揩油。」</p>
<p>原來美國各大城像紐約的或波斯頓的地下電車，在車站的入口處裝有自動旋門，每個乘客得先把車資投進一個機器，才能進云。因為車資是一律的，所以進去以後，你就可以乘到目的地下來。待你出車站以後，要想再進去，就得再付車値。在這種車輛中，根本是無需售票員的。沒有售票員，揩油安能存在？</p>
<p>但是奇怪的是，在有售票員的公共汽車上，他們的售票員也是不揩油的。因爲車資的種類少（普通祇有遠近兩種），所以賣起票來也方便。他們的辦法是車資由乘客直接投入一貯錢筒中，不經過售票員的手。售票員的責仟祇是軋票和找錢。</p>
<p>所以售票員不揩油，並不是一僩空幻的理想，而是可以辦得到的。我們常然不希望公司當局爲根絕揩油之風起見，立刻改用機器收費，使多數的售票員失業。但是我們以爲在安定了售票員的生活，實施以相當的敎育，把售票的手續更改以後，售票員揩油也許可以成爲歷史上的陳跡的。</p>

<h3>辨認僞幣的化學鉛筆</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>在銀幣流通市上之時，僞幣之辨認，實係一大麻煩問題。美國警務當局，對於民衆之辨認僞鈔敎育，施行甚力，甚至特）開專班，作普遍之宣傳及敎授。最近有科學家，發明一種化學鉛筆，對於辨認銀幣，大有幫助。其法先以刀刮所欲辨認之「銀」幣之表面，然後將此化學鉛筆尖潤濕之後，點在幣面，倘該幣係僞造者，則立即有黑點出現在幣面。如係眞幣，則無黑點。</p>

<h3>新聞記者的遮眼法</h3>
<p>— 思中</p>
<p>當希特勒的閃電戰在荷蘭展開的時候，荷蘭當道守口如瓶，嚴格檢查新聞，不許任何訪員洩露戰事消息。但是紐約論壇報駝安姆斯特丹訪員康琪發出了　個措詞巧妙的電報，將實在的消息傳到報館。他的電文是：「荷蘭一切安謐，正與六月一日左右紐奧爾良州四周之情形相同。」紐約論壇報根據這封電報，揭載了「德軍侵荷，荷人決堤」的驚人消息，使別種報紙大為减色。荷蘭的新聞檢查員看不透那一報中的奧妙，可是機敏的報館編輯能够在它的字裏行間，尋着眞意。原來所謂「六月一日左右紐奧爾良州四周之情形」的意思，就是密西西比河決口，四周的區域全成澤國。荷蘭變成了澤國，一定是決堤所致，那麽德軍的進犯，也不言而喻了</p>
<p>從前列寗病危的時候，駐莫斯科的各國新聞記者遇着一項難題。列寗如果病歿，蘇俄政府在對本國人民宜布這件消息以前，一定不許任何記者對外國發表。蘇俄政府也許暫時秘不發喪，以免國內發生變動。</p>
<p>倫敦哈斯德報記者萊文正在那時回國一行。他和報館中約定，倘若列寗病故，他便發一通電報，請報館滙款一百五十金鎊。列寗死了以後，新聞檢查員果眞截留報告這件事的一切電訊，所以萊文就遵照原約，請滙款項。不幸報館當局忘記了密約。回答他說：「透支已多，碍難照辦，」以致錯過了一個大可轟動全世界的機會。</p>
<p>美國和西班牙交戰時，駐在關塔那摩島的美軍兵士突然染者流行性的黄熱病，因此士氣沮喪。美政府立刻檢查新聞，不許將那件消息傳出島外。紐約太陽日報主任訪員向本館報告同事的行動，電文內容平淡無奇。他說；「本報同人均安。安德生往金斯頓。勞合在此。Jack　Ochre隨軍在關塔那摩島。李却遜在營。」這篇電文中的奧妙、，全在JackOcher兩個字，因爲黄熱病的英文別名是＂Yellow　Jack＂＂Ocher＂的意思是「绪土」或「金幣。」隔過幾分鐘，美。報紙上登出了驚人消息，標題是「黄熱病在關島流行，染及無數兵士。」</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>行軍速率</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>據德方最近聲稱：他們的陸軍能以每天行　十二哩的速率　走十六天。這眞是極高的速度。</p>
<p>美國軍隊認爲每天行十四哩已經算好的了，行十六哩的當屬例外。但在歷史上，行軍速率倒着實有過幾次光榮的紀錄。當圍攻仇哥維亞地方時，凱撒的兵隊在一天內走了五十哩；打了一仗，接着又在第二天回轉。一八零六年，拿破崙進攻普魯士時，他的頂好的士兵曾以每天行三十三哩的速率連走過十三天世界最高的行軍紀錄，卻還要讓給亞歷山大大帝，他在紀元前三三　年阿倍拉一役後，命令他的陸軍奮力前進，以每天行三十六哩半的速率，連走了十一天之久。</p>
<p>與此番希特勒逃攻俄羅斯的行軍情况相倣的，當推美國南北戰爭的時候。當時，雪爾門將軍行經喬治亞州時，同樣也帶了大批軍器與食糧，雪爾門的部隊郤只能走得十二哩一天，較諸希特勒，計有十哩之差呢。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>大約九點半鐘模樣，他們突然聽見對街起了了陣打門的聲音，接着是不很淸楚的說　聲：漸漸地，聲音擴大了，似乎有好幾個人在爭吵。不多一會，雙方開始打架了，秋海棠和張老穴都可以很淸楚地聽見孟老掌櫃和另外兩三個人被摔倒在地上的聲響；後來又是一陣極急促的奔跑聲，自南至北，快得像馬一樣，而且還不止是一個人或兩個人的脚聲。</p>
<p>「啊！不好了！他們把林生搶走了……！」立刻，又聽見孟老掌櫃在街上殺猪似的嚎叫着，並且還像有兩個人一先一後的追了下去</p>
<p>街上便頓時熱鬧起來：先是孟家小內掌櫃一邊哭，一邊馬，接着又是左隣右舍紛紛出來詢問；孟老掌櫃却還在埋怨他的伙計不出力，各人的聲昔鬧成了一片。</p>
<p>「這就糟啦！老二眞要闖禍了！」憑秋海棠那樣聰明的人，不消聽完這一幕隔壁戲，心裏已有五六分明白了；只是他還想不透玉崑爲什麽要約了人，把孟家的小掌櫃架走。</p>
<p>可是這一點，到得第二天早上便完全明白了。</p>
<p>「吳大哥，這麽早的時候來打擾你，眞對不起！」在早上七點鐘模樣，孟老掌櫃的一家便趕過來了，亂糟糟地站在秋海棠的坑前，顯得非常慌急的樣子。孟老掌櫃便第一個向他拱着雙手，用一種怪可憐的聲晋說：「實在因爲昨天晚上來了幾個不相識的人，好像是跟林生有一此蹩扭，一打開門，便跟咱們爭吵起來。（二二〇）</p>

<h3>Mobile Unit of China Air Force Dispatched, Bombing Japanese Troops on Both Sides of the Miluo River, Japanese Reinforcements from Wengjiang and Other Places to Invade Southward are Blocked, Large Armies from Guizhou and Guangxi Have Been Transferred to the Front Lines for Combat</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The most intense battles between Chinese and Japanese forces are currently taking place in northern Hunan. The fate of Changsha will depend on the outcome of the current Miluo River campaign. It is reported that both sides have suffered significant casualties. Yesterday, the Chinese Air Force fiercely bombed Japanese troops on both sides of the Miluo River and Japanese warships anchored along Dongting Lake. According to Chinese sources, a squadron of Chinese aircraft bombed Japanese warships anchored on the southern shore of Dongting Lake yesterday afternoon, as the Japanese attempted to land at a certain location there in order to encircle the Chinese forces defending the southern shore of the Miluo River. At the same time, another squadron of Chinese aircraft fiercely bombed Japanese troop concentrations on both sides of the Miluo River. The Japanese are currently continuing to increase their reinforcements and add them to the Hunan Province campaign. According to the latest estimates from the Chinese side, the total number of Japanese troops in the area has reached around 100,000. Japanese aircraft are also dispatched to bomb Chinese positions. The Japanese forces on the left flank (south of the Miluo River) are currently showing signs of moving towards Pingjiang in the southeast. Japanese warships are continuing their efforts to land troops on the southeastern shore of Dongting Lake, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. Chinese forces on the north bank of the Miluo River are currently threatening the left flank of the Japanese forces and continue to exert pressure on the Japanese rear. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The decisive battle in northern Hunan has begun. After the Japanese forces were intercepted on both sides of the Miluo River, one force has retreated to the area east of Wukou and southwest of Pingjiang. At the same time, tens of thousands of Japanese reinforcements from the north bank of the Xinqiang River have also crossed the river from the Yanglin Street and Shagang area and infiltrated near Pingjiang. Chinese soldiers recognized that the time had come and rose up to encircle and attack the Japanese forces. As of yesterday, both sides were still engaged in bloody battles. (Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Uneven Living Conditions of Civil Servants, Executive Yuan Plans Adjustments, Unequal Treatment Promotes Personnel Turnover, Committee Will Be Established to Plan Adjustment Measures</h3>
<p>Chongqing – During wartime, the living conditions of civil servants vary greatly. For example, government agencies mostly provide only a small subsidy in addition to subsidized rice, bringing the total to 100 yuan. However, some state-owned enterprises provide several times this amount, causing resentment in some quarters and promoting personnel turnover. The Executive Yuan therefore plans to establish a Wartime Civil Servant Living Improvement Committee to make adjustments. Whether subsidized rice should be abolished and replaced with a rice subsidy in order to simplify procedures and reduce corruption will also be decided. In the Supreme National Defense Council, there is another proposal to abolish subsidized rice and small subsidies, and to provide all civil servants, regardless of their nature, with a wartime subsidy of 250 yuan, but this has not yet been submitted for discussion.

<h3>Penalties for Late Payment of Land Tax in Kind</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The penalties for late payment of land tax in kind, passed by the Executive Yuan yesterday, are unprecedented in their severity. According to the regulations, grain households should pay in full within two months after the start of the land tax collection period.

If collection is unsuccessful, a portion of the land will be auctioned off. According to authorities' estimates, there will be good harvests in all areas this year, and the tax amount averages less than one-tenth of the harvest, so grain households can pay enthusiastically. The problems that need to be solved at present are storage and transportation. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>No Clues in Search for Mrs. Clark</h3>
<p>Beiping – Since the Japanese wife of British Intelligence Counselor Clark went missing on Saturday, there have been no clues today.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Situation and the Battle of Northern Hunan</h3>
<p>Since the end of the Battle of Wuhan, Japan seems to have lost faith in using force as the only solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. The battles on the battlefield rarely have decisive advances or retreats, so in the minds of some people, their attention to the war has invisibly faded with the passage of time, and problems such as the progress and retreat of the European War and the relationship between the United States and Japan have replaced this position. In today's China, it is true that the close connection and influence between various factors cannot be denied, not to mention that the Sino-Japanese problem is an important part of it; however, changes in the international community can affect the future of events in the Far East. China's progress and retreat are also sufficient to influence world trends; this is the most valuable harvest of the past four years. Today's situation absolutely cannot be measured with the old perspective of the past. The war between China and Japan is a matter of life and death for both countries, but it is also a matter of safety and security for the international situation. China's combat has been praised and assisted by the world, and President Roosevelt even praised it as the great national defense of the United States. In addition to the recognition based on justice, it should be understood from this connection.</p>
<p>Because Japan is short of strength in the Sino-Japanese problem, it has always emphasized methods other than military ones in the past three or four years. Its year-round talk of southward advance is certainly to satisfy its desire for expansion, but on the other hand, it is also a step in "solving the Sino-Japanese incident." In the minds of some Japanese people, they seem to have never deeply realized the internal national power of China, and always regard China's combat as the credit of friendly assistance, so they have the view that if the relationship between Britain and the United States can be resolved, the war against China will naturally be resolved. From the anti-British movement in the previous year to the recent negotiations with the United States, many of them started from this understanding. However, no friendly country will force China to succumb, and China's firm position cannot be shaken by any international fluctuations; in the past few years, there has been the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in Tokyo, and there has been the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Burma Railway. Those difficult adversities have failed to shake China's firm will in the slightest. This situation may be seen more clearly by third countries than by Japan. Therefore, if Japan's main intention in conducting US-Japan negotiations is to hope that the "Sino-Japanese Incident" can be resolved through the mediation of the United States, then it is not surprising that these negotiations have no result. The Tokyo military department's brazen statement that "it is determined to carry out the war against China to the end no matter what the opposition" is a revelation of the inner workings of the Japanese authorities and a vent of frustration after the failure of diplomatic use with the United States. The call for southward advance was once used to help the poverty of the war against China, and after hitting a wall in the southward advance. They will inevitably try again for military adventures in China, even if that may not really reap any results. At least it can be used to show off to the international community, indicating that Japan still has the strength to threaten China. If they can fortunately succeed, that will naturally be a major harvest in the years of stalemate. This is probably the reason for its large-scale invasion in northern Hunan this time.</p>
<p>According to the custom of the past four years, every time the autumn wind is strong, Japan often takes action in northern Hunan: After the fall of Wuhan in the 27th year, the Japanese army once advanced to the vicinity of Changsha. Relying on the effective combat of the Chinese army, the situation was turned from danger to safety. In the autumn of the 28th year, the Japanese gathered nearly 200,000 main troops and violently attacked from northern Hunan in multiple routes, but the result was a great victory for the Chinese army. Only last year, because Japan was intent on advancing south and disturbing China's southeastern coast, there was no large-scale invasion in northern Hunan, but small contacts occurred constantly, and the Chinese and Japanese armies have always been separated by the Xinqiang River for three years. Judging from the terrain of northern Hunan, the terrain on both sides of the railway and highway from Yuezhou to Changsha is flat and there is no danger to defend. On the other hand, the waterway of the Xiangjiang River and Dongting Lake has formed the most convenient route for the Japanese army to act from Yuezhou to Changsha. This easy-to-attack and difficult-to-defend terrain is suitable for Japan's current standard of avoiding the important and taking the light. If Changsha is not defended, then Hengyang will also be in danger, and thus the hub of north-south traffic in southern China will also be seriously threatened. This certainly has no decisive significance in resolving the Sino-Japanese war, but Japan may achieve many gains at a lower cost. This battle was launched on the 7th of this month at Dayun Mountain between Linxiang and Yuezhou, and turned into a frontal contact south of the Xinqiang River on the 18th. After the 20th, the Japanese army was blocked on both sides of the Miluo River. In the tragic fighting, the Chinese army won a major victory, but the Japanese army once again used the old strategy of extending the wings and encircling. On one side, hundreds of ships invaded Yingtan Xiangyin on the south bank of Dongting Lake, and on the other side, they advanced east along the Miluo River, attempting to attack Pingjiang. The troops mobilized by the Japanese army this time are only half of those in the northern Hunan battle of the previous year, and they were still drawn from various battlefields. Strategically, there is no novel use or deployment, then with the sharp and expanding Chinese army, it should be able to achieve the effect of ease, but this battle has great significance for all parties inside and outside, and the Chinese army's interception and response should not be negligent in the slightest.</p>
<p>Although Japan no longer has the strength and determination to solve the Sino-Japanese incident by force, military victory is still the only way for China to complete its combat goals. Only in this way can it give full play to China's great contribution to international justice and future peace, and it is also what all anti-aggression countries and people expect from China. In the international community, even if there is still some haze, China's major achievements in the military will surely be enough to eliminate it invisibly.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Announces US Prepares to Arm Merchant Ships; Will Request Congress to Amend Neutrality Act; Attaches Great Importance to the Pink Star Incident</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the United States may move towards arming merchant ships. The President also mentioned that the Panamanian-registered American ship "Pink Star," which recently sank near Iceland, was equipped with a self-defense gun. However, the President declined to say how many Panamanian-registered ships were so equipped. The President has clearly indicated that he will ask Congress to amend or even repeal the Neutrality Act so that American ships flying the American flag can be armed. He stated that a decision would be made next week, and that the United States may arm American merchant ships on one hand, and arm ships of other American republics on the other. He also said that the United States would do its best to protect these captains. The "Pink Star" incident is just another clear proof of illegal warfare, and that the world is currently facing an unprecedented disaster in history, with some groups attempting to rule the world. The President also stated that the "Pink Star" sank at 11:25 PM on Friday. The ship was being protected by a Canadian convoy when it was attacked by a submarine 275 miles northeast of Cape Race. President Roosevelt recalled that in 1917, the Senate obstructed the arming of merchant ships, but President Wilson at the time believed he had the power to do so and proceeded accordingly. President Roosevelt stated that he has virtually completed investigating the details of the American ship's attack on the high seas, and that the main goal now is to defend the New World and defeat the countries that are trying to rule the world.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th - President Roosevelt's remarks about the United States moving towards arming American merchant ships were met with opposition from "isolationists" in Congress yesterday. Democratic Senator Clark of Illinois said, "If President Roosevelt attempts to advance this matter through legislative procedures, he will encounter the most difficult debate in Congress." Republican Senator Tobey of New Hampshire said, "Arming merchant ships is another step into war." The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee stated that he was prepared to assist President Roosevelt in implementing this through legislative procedures after learning the details.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th - Reliable sources revealed today that many of the 125 American merchant ships flying the Panamanian flag are already equipped with weapons, and the United States plans to install cannons on the remaining ships. This can be done without changing the Neutrality Act. Forty-five of these ships are owned by the US government. It is understood that the Army Department's special rapid-firing five-inch dual-purpose guns are intended to make air defense one of the most sophisticated aspects of national defense. The structure of this dual-purpose gun can be used to deal with pirate ships and bombers. During the last World War, American armed merchant ships only used three-inch guns.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th - Secretary of State Hull, when discussing the sinking of the "Pink Star" at a press conference yesterday, expressed confidence in the ability of the US Navy to deal with Axis pirate ships. Hull stated that he would prefer the Navy Department itself to discuss the actions taken in response to this particular incident. Hull stated that the State Department is currently collecting all possible information about the sinking of the ship.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 24th - The State Department stated yesterday that 23 survivors from the American freighter "Pink Star," which sank near Iceland on Friday, have arrived in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. The State Department stated that details about the other 11 sailors have not yet been received.</p>
<p>The Public Opinion of Thirty-Seven US States Urges the Government to Declare War on Germany</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th - The "New York Times" has been strenuously demanding the repeal of the Neutrality Act since the sinking of the American ship "Pink Star," stating that if the Nazi government claims that the ship was sunk by a German submarine, it is in accordance with the laws of war. If the United States acquiesces to this, it will succumb to Germany's control of the sea. We believe we have every right to protect our commerce at sea. Germany's blockade has no basis in international law. To make our policy effective, we should arm our merchant ships. This will require the repeal of the Neutrality Act. This step should have been taken long ago. It should be known that Americans are currently not neutral in this war and have never known it. Today, the "New York Times" featured a full-page advertisement urging the United States to immediately declare war on Germany. The cost of this advertisement was borne by the American people of thirty-seven states.</p>
<p>Germany Openly Provokes the US; Maritime War Is Difficult to Avoid</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 24th - After the US President issued a statement that submarines would be shot on sight, the American ship "Pink Star" was sunk by a submarine in Icelandic waters. Is this an open provocation, or is it due to negligence? Observers cannot say for sure at this time. The lack of details has led to much speculation. Some members of Congress previously believed that Axis pirate ships had received instructions to stay away from the American defense line to avoid conflict with American warships, which could lead to an explosive situation. Therefore, there was no news of incidents within the maritime defense line. But the sinking of the "Pink Star" has now broken this theory. Will the unlimited war within the maritime defense line begin with this?</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 24th - Since the sinking of the American freighter "Pink Star," the US Atlantic Fleet has cleared its decks and prepared for battle. It is widely believed that these ships are currently in the North Atlantic, searching for submarines. President Roosevelt recently declared that any Axis submarine or surface pirate ship found in the US maritime defense zone would be attacked. Officials believe that the recent sinking of the "Pink Star" is a direct challenge to President Roosevelt's recent announcement. It is believed here that Germany not only does not want to withdraw its warships from the US maritime defense zone, but also wants to risk conflict with the US Navy in order to prove that attacking ships in the blockade zone announced by Berlin is a legitimate act.</p>
<p>Berlin Remains Silent; Italian Media Warns the US</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 24th - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said last night that they have not yet received news from the German side about the sinking of the "Pink Star," which was flying the Panamanian flag.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 24th - Today, the German side refused to acknowledge or deny responsibility for the sinking of the "Red Star," but insisted that this action was "in accordance with international war regulations." They also added that the US is "fully aware of our blockade zone."</p>
<p>International News Service, Rome, 24th - Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, wrote in the "Italian Daily" today, warning that Axis ships would not hesitate to attack American ships attempting to reach England. Gayda declared that if American ships enter the blockade zone announced by the Axis powers, Italian torpedo boats will not hesitate to attack them. These are the same torpedo boats that were used to sink ships in the inner harbor of Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>US Navy Secretary Knox Strongly Advocates Repealing the Neutrality Act; Another Giant New Battleship Is Launched</h3>
<p>Reuters, Quincy, Massachusetts, 24th - The US 35,000-ton new battleship "Massachusetts" (note: this is the fourth of the six new battleships with which the United States is strengthening its two-ocean navy) was launched yesterday morning, attracting tens of thousands of spectators. Navy Secretary Knox came to attend the ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that the Neutrality Act hinders the efforts of the United States and should be repealed immediately. Those who are dedicated to keeping the war away from the American coast should not be hindered in any way. We must repeal this act in a timely manner. If American security is to be maintained, the United States must rely on maintaining naval power for many years to come. Transporting the necessary aid anytime, anywhere is a necessity. Our work is to keep the war away from the Americas. Let us not tie the hands of President Roosevelt. The battleship that has just been launched may have to participate in the Second World War for human freedom. The "Massachusetts" and other warships that have recently been launched and are still under construction will be equipped with the largest heavy guns and participate in the navy's task of clearing the sea lanes between the United Kingdom and the United States. Knox also stated that recent events on the Soviet front have slightly dimmed the prospects for victory. The number of casualties on the Soviet battlefield is greater than in any battle in history. The war on the Soviet front is directly related to our own situation. After the "Massachusetts" was launched, the new destroyer "Firestone" was placed on the keel where the "Massachusetts" had been in order to begin construction.</p>

<h3>On the Ukrainian Front, German Forces Continue to Advance Eastward; Red Army Counterattack in the Central Sector Is Victorious; German Aircraft Raid on Moscow Fails</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report for the night of the 23rd, stating that during the day, our army continued to fight the enemy along the entire front. On the 21st, 53 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 28 of which were shot down in aerial combat and 25 of which were destroyed at the airfield. We lost 16 aircraft.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Red Army in the central sector achieved another victory yesterday. After four days of fighting, the Red Army led by Maslennikov inflicted a major blow on the enemy's 102nd Division, 233rd, and 235th Regiments, and forced the enemy to retreat to the opposite bank of the Dvina River. The enemy left behind 2,500 bodies. Our army also seized many spoils of war.</p>
<p>International News Service, Berlin, 24th - The official German news agency here announced today that the German Air Force has achieved a major victory, sinking a Soviet battleship in the Baltic Sea, and launching a fierce attack on the industrial center of Kharkov in Ukraine. At the same time, it also stated that since the German army occupied Kiev after the final battle, 750,000 Soviet troops have been eliminated by the German army in the pocket-shaped area east of Kiev. German forces are still continuing to advance towards Kharkov and Rostov. The Nazi bulletin acknowledged for the first time today that Soviet forces have launched counterattacks on the southern and central fronts, but claimed that each Red Army counterattack has been repulsed and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The city of Kharkov in Ukraine is currently the target of the German offensive. The city is comparable in size to Kiev, with a population of 840,000. Kharkov is an important transportation hub. Railways from various ports on the Black Sea pass through the city to Moscow. The city is also an important industrial center.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - A Soviet news agency reported that in a certain area of the Leningrad front, Soviet troops broke through the fire net of heavy artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons, and launched a bayonet attack on a bridge. German troops could not resist and retreated seven miles. Yesterday, a semi-official German statement acknowledged that the Soviet offensive in the central sector was very fierce, but claimed that it would be a major mistake to say that the Soviet offensive had succeeded. The Soviet offensive east of Smolensk had been broken by German artillery fire. The losses of Soviet soldiers and equipment were exceptionally heavy. Many Soviet units lost more than two-thirds of their strength in front of the German lines, and those who followed and charged into the German artillery fire over corpses were also repulsed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - An Air Ministry spokesman said that British fighter planes have been fighting the German Air Force in Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 24th - Last night, a group of German aircraft attempted to raid Moscow, but were dispersed by anti-aircraft fire and fighter planes. Only two managed to penetrate the city's airspace, dropping a small number of high-explosive bombs and incendiaries, causing minor damage.</p>
<p>German Forces Prepare for Winter Trench Warfare Along a Vast Front</p>
<p>Reuters, Central Front, Soviet Union, 24th - The representative of the Soviet Army Headquarters on the Central Front, Major General Sokolovsky, recently told reporters that German forces are clearly digging trenches along a front stretching from over a hundred miles to over a thousand miles, adopting a defensive posture. Winter is coming, and when the ground is muddy, there will be trench warfare. The German reserves have not yet been exhausted, but they are close to exhaustion. In winter warfare, German forces will greatly lose their mobility. The German army has now begun to use horses instead of motor vehicles. Roads everywhere are becoming difficult to travel, and the German army is undoubtedly suffering from a severe oil shortage. The severe cold of winter will become a new problem for the German army. The Soviet army has sheepskin coats and snow boots for warmth. As demonstrated in the Finnish War, Soviet soldiers can stay outdoors day and night at fifty degrees below freezing when necessary, while German soldiers cannot withstand this cold.</p>
<p>The Nazi Army Suffered Heavy Losses in the Failed Attempt to Invade Moscow</p>
<p>The Major General described the reasons for the failure of the German army's attempt to break through the Smolensk area and invade Moscow, stating that since the German army began its invasion of Smolensk, it has lost 1,950 aircraft in this area alone. As a result of the Soviet counteroffensive starting in early September, a large area of land stretching 60 miles in length and 6 miles to 30 miles in depth has been reclaimed along the front line. Ten German divisions were completely destroyed or partially annihilated. The enemy has recently had to redeploy ten divisions to reinforce them. These troops were transferred from other parts of the front line, but there is no evidence that they were transferred from the Leningrad area. The Soviet army is currently about 25 miles from Smolensk. He then emphasized that the Soviet artillery is far superior in quality. When the Soviet artillery controls the battlefield, the chaos and inaccuracy of the German artillery fire are surprising. Tens of thousands of German vehicles have been lost in this area, mostly due to the artillery. At present, the Soviet Air Force also maintains superiority on this front, and enemy aircraft have avoided engaging Soviet aircraft. A major factor in the failure of the German army on the Smolensk front is that its rear areas have been weakened by the activities of guerrillas and the hostility of the local population, as it has had to transfer a large number of troops from the front to take care of the rear. Currently, only the main roads from Minsk to Smolensk are under German control. German soldiers dare not venture off the roads unless they form large groups. Guerrillas constantly attack German convoys and transport teams. The failure of the German army's invasion of Moscow has forced Hitler to transfer his central army to Leningrad and Ukraine. According to the information received, the German army will encounter the same difficulties in Leningrad and Ukraine and ultimately fail, as it did in Smolensk.</p>
<p>In the Battle of the Lake Ilmen Area, German Casualties Reached 50,000</p>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 24th - The Red Star reported yesterday that three teams of the Red Army in the Lake Ilmen area launched a counterattack in a certain area, which is the opposite of what the Germans claimed about being surrounded. The Red Star claimed that the German army suffered 50,000 casualties in the Battle of Lake Ilmen. It also claimed that the German 56th Regiment and eight tank teams were destroyed. The Red Star also acknowledged that the Soviet army suffered a total of 30,000 casualties.</p>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 24th - Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky stated that the number of casualties on both sides in the Battle of Leningrad was extremely alarming. Lozovsky mocked the German statistics on the number of officer and soldier casualties. He estimated that the German losses were about 2.3 million, based on estimates from various sources and the testimony of prisoners. He also stated that fierce fighting continues in Leningrad. He stated, "Although the German army likes to exaggerate, they have not claimed any progress in the Leningrad area."</p>
<p>German Offensives in the Leningrad and Odessa Areas Were Repulsed</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 24th - Soviet troops engaged in bayonet fighting during a fierce offensive in the Leningrad and Odessa areas yesterday. It is said that German troops have been forced to retreat. The official communique stated that the Red Army, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a resolute attack, finally forcing German troops on the Leningrad front to retreat seven miles. German troops in the Odessa area were also forced to retreat several miles. Moscow Radio announced last night that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the casualties of the Romanian army have accounted for half of the country's army.</p>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 24th - News from Odessa reports that the Romanian army launched a hundred attacks in the first month and has now been stopped after advancing one kilometer. The Red Star claimed that Odessa has been surrounded for the 49th day, and fierce fighting is still ongoing near the southwest of the city. The German and Romanian troops suffered thousands of casualties in the Battle of Odessa, and armored vehicles and firearms were destroyed. It also stated that in the battle on the northern front, the German 3rd Division was also defeated. The Red Army attacked from the side, forcing the German army to retreat in disorder.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 23rd - Reports say that most of the Soviet "Daredevil Teams" are composed of young Communist Party members and have now joined the defense of Leningrad and the port of Osa.</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Conducting Military Activities in Bulgaria; Britain Will Send Troops to the Caucasus to Help the Soviet Union Defend Oil Fields</h3>
<p>United Press International, Ankara, 24th - Reliable sources here said yesterday that Bulgarian troops are currently moving north along the Danube River, causing traffic jams. It is believed here that a Soviet-Bulgarian war is inevitable.</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 24th - Moscow Radio broadcasted yesterday that Bulgaria has mobilized 400,000 troops, and German engineers are currently building roads. The radio station stated, "The Germans continue to prepare Bulgaria and train Bulgarian troops for war against the Soviet Union and Turkey."</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 24th - According to travelers, Bulgaria continues to conduct military preparations very actively. The Germans have taken over the Bulgarian railways for their own use. Foreigners in Bulgaria are under close police surveillance. Soviet embassy and consulate staff are followed by secret agents every time they go out. There are currently only four Soviet women residing in Bulgaria. Opinions differ in diplomatic circles here regarding German activities in Bulgaria. Some say that the German goal is to facilitate its maritime attack on the Caucasus, while others say that the Germans will put pressure on Turkey after reaching the Caucasus. Some also say that the Germans want to force Turkey to allow their warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait and transport troops through Turkey. Still others say that the Germans want to seize full power in Bulgaria so that they can use Bulgaria as a base for war against the Soviet Union or Turkey. However, Turkish authorities do not believe that the current developments in Bulgaria have reached a point of endangering Turkey.</p>
<p>United Press International, Ankara, 24th - Several newspapers here yesterday published rumors that Britain may send troops to the Caucasus to cooperate with the Soviet Union in combat. The "Tasviri Daily" said that the number of troops would be about 225,000 and that Germany may demand facilities from Istanbul to facilitate its war against the Soviet Union. However, well-informed circles believe that this request is impossible. Recent German victories have left a bad impression on the Turkish press. Turkish newspapers ridiculed the possibility of effective British and American aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, Returns to His Post, Carrying a Letter from Hitler</h3>

<h3>Allied Representatives' Conference Opens in London Yesterday; Resolution Passed Supporting the Atlantic Charter; Soviet Representative Urges Increased Unity</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - The Allied Conference, chaired by Foreign Secretary Eden, held its second conference here today. Representatives of all countries fighting for freedom unanimously passed a resolution declaring support for the principles of the "Atlantic Charter" agreed upon by Roosevelt and Churchill. Czech representative Masaryk issued a joint declaration on behalf of the Czech and Polish governments, stating that the intention of both governments is to believe that there must be safeguards to prevent a third German-initiated war. Any weapons that Germany may use to continue its aggression must be completely destroyed. The Soviet Union attended the conference for the first time. Its representatives were Ambassador Maisky and Bogomolov. In addition, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Belgium, Free France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg also sent representatives to attend. In addition to Eden, the UK representatives included Minister without Portfolio, Mr. GreenWood, Dominions Secretary, Viscount Cranborne, Indian Secretary, Mr. Amery, and Colonial Secretary, Lord Moyne.</p>
<p>Eden's Speech</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 24th - Foreign Secretary Eden said in his opening speech that since the previous meeting, great progress has been made on new plans for cooperation. He also stated that not long after the last meeting, Hitler followed his old tricks and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. Since then, the Soviet government and people have defended themselves with their courage, determination, and talent, and have earned the admiration of the world. Today, the Soviet ambassador is attending the meeting here for the first time on behalf of his government, and I dare say that all representatives present sincerely welcome him. Eden then extended a welcome to the Greek representative before presenting the eight-point program agreed upon at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, which was unanimously approved by everyone. The meeting was held at the famous St. James's Palace.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky addressed the Allied Conference on behalf of the Soviet government, stating that the convening of this meeting is timely, as Hitler's Germany, after trampling and enslaving several European countries, continues to wage war against the Soviet Union with force and unprecedented brutality. Since the Nazi invasion, it has been one month. During this period, the Soviet army, navy, and air force have fought heroically, shouldering the great responsibility of fighting aggressors who threaten freedom-loving countries and endanger civilization and culture. The fate of Europe and mankind for centuries to come will be decided in this war of Hitler and Fascism against democratic countries. The first task for those forced to fight Hitler's Germany and its allies is to resolutely defeat the aggressor. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to unite as one and go all out with all our strength and resources. Therefore, all governments sending representatives to this meeting must unite with each other and lay the foundation for postwar international relations so that they will no longer be poisoned by Nazism. The Soviet Union firmly believes that this goal will be achieved smoothly, and the complete and final victory will lay the cornerstone of international cooperation and goodwill, in line with the wishes and concepts of freedom-loving people. The Soviet Union supports the rights of all countries to independence and territorial integrity, and their right to choose their own social and governmental forms, and always condemns acts of aggression that violate the sovereignty of others. The Soviet government has announced its acceptance of the declaration of British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt, and is willing to provide all possible assistance to the peoples who have been invaded and are fighting for independence. It also advocates for general disarmament.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Opposes Nazi Philosophy, Vows to Fight to the End; Maisky Explains the Stalin Constitution, Religious Freedom is Absolute in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - Soviet Ambassador Maisky stated in a speech in London yesterday that the Soviet people would fight against "Nazi philosophy" to their last drop of blood. He stated that the so-called philosophy of the Nazis is a direct challenge to the principles we believe in and uphold. The Soviet Union advocates that all people should treat each other as brothers and sisters and live in friendship, and that all nations should have self-determination. The Constitution established by Stalin in 1936 guarantees that many ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union have complete freedom of ethnic development. The Soviet Union also recognizes that the internal order of each Soviet country is its own concern. The Soviet Union considers religion a private matter for every citizen. Although many outsiders have misconceptions, religion has not been destroyed in the Soviet Union. Every citizen has the right to believe or not believe according to their own views. One clause of the Stalin Constitution states, "In order to protect citizens' freedom of belief, churches and state schools are completely separated within the Soviet Union, and it is recognized that all citizens have the freedom of religious worship and anti-religious propaganda." In 1940, there were more than 8,000 independent religious churches of various kinds within the Soviet Union, with approximately 6,000 clergy. Believers were free to practice their faith, go to church for worship, marry in church, baptize and name children, hold religious ceremonies, celebrate religious festivals, and freely elect their leaders. The Soviet government does not assist any particular religion, but exempts buildings used for religious ceremonies from taxes. Soviet courts punish those who violate the rights of believers. Orthodox believers are the most numerous and are currently divided into two major factions: the "New Church" and the "Old Church." The Old Church is expanding its influence to other countries, especially the United States. Other denominations include the Evangelical Church and the Adventist Church, among many others. Generally speaking, there are many kinds of religions in the Soviet Union, and their activities are not hindered, it is said.</p>
<h3>Leader of the Free French Forces Announces the Organization of a National Committee to Exercise Power for the Liberation of the French Nation Until a Legitimate Government is Established</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, announced yesterday the organization of the Free French National Committee as the trustee of France, until a representative government in accordance with the constitution is established. De Gaulle... the United States and other countries will now decide whether to recognize this committee in place of the Vichy government. The list of members of the new committee will be announced today, totaling eight or nine people, who are representatives of the free French authorities around the world who can freely represent the views of French people and are qualified. De Gaulle will continue to serve as the leader of the Free French Forces, and the Defense Council of the Free French Forces will not be replaced by the committee, but will continue to work in special areas of France such as Africa, the Far East, and the Pacific. De Gaulle also stated that the committee will share the responsibility of exercising power with him. The committee has only one policy, which is to seek the liberation of French territory. The committee will recognize itself as a temporary trustee to represent the French people who cannot express their wishes except through Free France, and will... the backbone of organizations that can exercise national sovereignty in the future. De Gaulle, referring to the Free French Defense Council under the new National Committee, stated that the war has shown the necessity of decentralization in various regions. The Defense Council has addressed this need in the most appropriate way. The British government's dispatch of Duff Cooper and Lyttelton to Singapore and the East is also an acknowledgment of the necessity of local decentralization. I wish to clarify our position on the legal status of the laws of the French Republic. This constitution and laws were destroyed by the invaders, and subsequently... gradually destroyed by the Vichy government colluding with the invaders. The Free French will never recognize these destructive acts. From now on, the Free French must exercise powers equivalent to those of a body representing national interests, and will return this power to the national representative body as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Free French Forces Have Strong Strength</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - An officer of the Free French Forces stated yesterday that the Free French Forces currently have 100,000 fully equipped soldiers and 1,000 trained or training pilots, and a large number of Free French are helping to protect shipping in the Atlantic.

The spirit of France is not dead. According to the letters received, 95% of the French people are waiting for an opportunity to assist Britain in winning the war.</p>

<h3>London Observers: Japan Seeks Opportunity to Attack the Soviet Union; Japanese Spokesman Discusses Soviet-Japanese Relations; Protest Against Floating Mines Has Received Reply</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 24th - Foreign ambassadors, when interviewed by the United Press today, predicted that if the German army occupies Rostov and seizes the Donets River basin in the former Soviet Union, and penetrates further into the Caucasus, then... the German alliance will begin to operate in the coming... if the German army achieves these goals in the spring, then Japan will attack the eastern border of the Soviet Union. They declared that Japan will wait until the Soviet Union has definitely lost half of its war and industry before providing assistance. German diplomats pointed out that the Soviet Union's loss of its raw material and military equipment center in Ukraine, and the potential fall of Leningrad as a manufacturing factory for Moscow, would cause the Soviet Union's western army to rely on factories in the Urals and east of the Urals. This situation would further weaken the Soviet Union's Far East army and encourage Japan to begin its offensive, it is said.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Government spokesman Ishii, when meeting with news reporters today and answering questions, said that the Soviet Union still has a great possibility of transporting war materials to Chongqing, but the Japanese government has not obtained definite information and he cannot say whether this action violates the neutrality agreement between the two countries. However, he believes that this action is indeed an unfriendly attitude of the Soviet government towards Japan. The spokesman also ridiculed the rumor spread by Chongqing that conflicts had occurred on the Manchurian-Soviet border, saying that everything is peaceful in that area. He then said that the Japanese government has not yet received a response from Moscow regarding its protest against Soviet mines reaching the Japanese sea. Although this is not a major event, the Soviet Union is very willing to discuss this issue with Japan. Ishii also answered questions, saying that although the United States and the Dutch East Indies no longer transport oil to Japan, Mexican oil is still flowing in. When asked whether the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" report that there is anti-Japanese sentiment in Bangkok political circles is credible, Ishii replied that this is the newspaper's observation, and he believes that some of it must be credible. He did not mention that the recent loan from Thailand to Japan has been used up and that negotiations are currently underway for a larger new loan. The original loan was not large, it is said.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Government spokesman Ishii stated that the Japanese side has received a reply from the Soviet Union regarding the protest against the discovery of Soviet floating mines in the Sea of Japan near Korea.

<h3>Factory Management Law During Air Raids</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Ministries of Social Affairs and Economic Affairs recently jointly drafted temporary measures for factory shutdowns, resumption of work, and wage allocation during air raids, which were announced and implemented on September 3. The original text is as follows: Article 1. Each factory should build air raid shelters or other air defense facilities and should pay attention to the strength of the project and sanitary facilities to ensure the safety of workers. Article 2. Work should be suspended immediately after an air raid alarm is issued, but factories with air raid shelter facilities that can be reached within five minutes may suspend work when an emergency alarm is issued. Article 3. Before leaving the factory after work, workers should properly handle the important tools, items, etc. of their assigned work and should not abandon them. Article 4. If the alarm is lifted one hour before the end of work, work should be resumed immediately. Article 5. If the alarm is lifted before 10:00 p.m., work should proceed as usual the next day. Article 6. If the alarm is lifted after 10:00 p.m., the start time for work the next morning should be postponed accordingly, based on the time from 10:00 p.m. to the lifting of the alarm, but the end time for work should still be as usual. Article 7. During air raid time, wages should be paid as usual, except for workers who do not resume work in accordance with the prescribed time. The wages of piece-rate workers during air raid time should be calculated and paid according to the standard of the number of pieces worked during the same time on the previous day. Article 8. If the air raid continues without being lifted, or if the factory has suffered damage due to the air raid and cannot resume work, wages may be allocated at one-third or one-half of the wages, depending on the economic situation of the factory and the amount of wages earned by the workers. The same applies to workers whose contracts have not yet expired and other temporary workers. Article 9. If the factory has suffered excessive losses and cannot resume work, workers may be laid off, but severance pay should be paid. Article 10. These measures will be implemented from the date of joint announcement by the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Social Affairs. (Electric Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>A Discussion of the European War (83)</p>
<h3>A Comparison of Stalin and Hitler</h3>
<p>Stalin achieved dictatorship due to his tenacious nature, complete ruthlessness, skill in using divisive tactics, and especially his ability to seize opportunities. He took Lenin as his own model, a guiding star, but Lenin knew Stalin's weaknesses very well. According to Stalin himself, Lenin once mentioned him, "This person is crude in nature and has great desires, he may therefore cause the party to split." Later, Stalin did as predicted, but he did not split the party, but completely purged the opposition within the party, so that three-quarters of the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Presidium of the Congress, the leaders of the army and navy, diplomatic personnel, government members, and heads of various departments, as well as factory managers and leaders in various parts of national life, disappeared, or resigned for their own and the country's interests.</p>
<p>There is a French proverb that says that everyone has their own character flaws. Stalin at least has character in his flaws. He is a strong, stubborn, suspicious, and self-confident person. He never ignored the two basic factors in the Soviet Union's international relations for a moment. He was always wary of external attacks and racked his brains, regardless of difficulties, to rectify the internal affairs of Soviet Russia and to meet the needs of modern warfare in terms of economy and industry.</p>
<p>Whether these flaws offset his character is difficult to say. Americans are amazed to see the methods Asians often use to make people loyal and unified. Timur died in his bed, and he conquered more territory than Alexander, but he was also a violent and arbitrary person. Therefore, those who believe that human beings have generosity and compassion and that life is sacred cannot help but feel lost.</p>
<p>Hitler is also a person who disregards everything, but he has been successful so far. In this respect, he and Stalin can certainly be compared.</p>
<p>However, I think that in the eyes of the world, the actions of the two may be very different. Hitler sometimes does not hesitate to bet everything, while Stalin is accustomed to taking advantage of opportunities. I dare not believe this statement to be true. Hitler only took one big risk, like Napoleon at the Battle of Lodi. In fact, famous people in ancient times did not really take risks. Napoleon, before winning a great victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, made it clear to his subordinates that they would hear that the commander-in-chief was stationed in the rear during the battle, engaging in dispatch, and not personally braving arrows. He said this in the orders he issued, and the glorious victory achieved in this battle was also unique in European history.</p>
<p>Hitler took a lucky risk in Munich in 1923, when he and a small team of henchmen, totaling no more than twenty people, were cut off by dense bullets. Hitler's escape was truly a narrow escape. Since then, he has acted after careful planning and no longer takes arbitrary risks. He does not act arbitrarily. The key to his success is meticulous preparation beforehand.</p>
<p>Hitler is Germany, he represents the soul of the German people. I am sure this is true, and the secret of Hitler's being seen as a god incarnate lies here. Russian fairy tales describe a giant, invincible, because his life is not in his body, but entrusted elsewhere. The enemy searches in vain, so they cannot kill him. Until the last day, the hero in the myth finds where his life is and is able to put him to death. It is said that the giant's life is hidden in a duck egg, and the little child called the hero crushes the egg and overthrows the giant. Hitler's life is also hidden in an egg, but this egg is in the body of the German eagle. What I mean is that his life is the life of the German people, he is not an ordinary person like us, but the concrete plan of Germanic... a symbol.</p>
<p>Is Stalin a representative of Russia? I think we still need to consider it if we want to deny it. The tenacity of the Russian people is even greater than what can be imagined from reading Dostoevsky and Chekhov's novels. If you want to understand Russia, you should read Pushkin's works or Tolstoy's "War and Peace." As far as the people of the entire Soviet Union are concerned, they are clever and cunning, and hidden behind a facade of wealth, they are not reliable for friends, but they will never forget enemies. Stalin's personality is also like this, but if we want to estimate his relationship with Russia, we must bring up the old question again and ask whether Russia is European or Asian. The answer is that it is both. I can now say that Stalin represents the Asian side of Russia, not the only element of Russia, as Hitler is the only element of Germany. (End)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Has Already Promulgated Guidelines for the Tutor System in Secondary and Higher Education to Avoid Education Becoming Commercialized</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) In order to correct the shortcomings of the current education, the Ministry of Education has referred to the old system of teacher training and guidance in our country and formulated guidelines for the tutor system in secondary and higher education, and has instructed all schools to follow them. The guidelines are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to correct the current educational bias towards knowledge transmission and neglect of moral education and to avoid the increasingly distant relationship between teachers and students and the gradual trend towards commercialization, this Ministry has referred to the old system of teacher training and guidance in our country and the methods of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom to formulate the tutor system and ordered secondary and higher education schools to comply with it. (2) Each school should divide the students of each grade into several groups, with each group having five to fifteen people. Each group should have one tutor, who should be a full-time teacher designated by the principal. The principal should also designate one head tutor or training director to manage the student training affairs of the entire school. (3) Tutors should observe the students' thoughts, behavior, academic performance, and physical and mental health, provide strict guidance based on their individual personalities, and promote their normal development in order to cultivate sound personalities (training guidelines will be formulated separately). (4) The training method is not limited to one type. In addition to individual training, tutors should make full use of after-school and holiday time to gather students in their groups to hold talks, discussions, field trips, etc. for group life training. (5) Tutors should record in detail the students' personality, thoughts, academic performance, and physical condition in accordance with the format and report to the school and students' parents once a month. The reports submitted to the school may be consulted by the competent educational administrative authority at any time. (6) Tutors of each group should hold a training meeting once a month to report on the implementation of training in each group and to study common problems related to training. The training meeting should be chaired by the principal. If the principal cannot attend due to circumstances, the head tutor or training director may attend on his behalf. (7) Tutors of each group should be responsible for the students' thoughts and behavior. If the students make special contributions in academics or careers after graduating from school or leaving the school, the honor should also be given to the original tutor. If the students' behavior is improper or their thoughts are incorrect due to the original tutor's ineffective training, the original tutor should also be held jointly responsible. The examination method will be formulated separately. (8) If the tutor believes that a student is not suitable for training, he may request the principal to approve his removal from training. The student removed from training may choose one of the tutors in the school to receive his training. If he is removed from training again, he will be expelled from the school. (9) When students graduate, the tutor should issue a training certificate, adding comments on the students' thoughts, behavior, and academic performance. This certificate may be consulted by the relevant parties at any time when students go on to further studies or seek employment. (10) This Ministry will designate inspectors to inspect the implementation of the tutor system in each school at any time and report to the Ministry on a special project. The educational departments of each province and city should send inspectors to inspect and guide at any time. (11) Each specialized school and university may formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the tutor system based on these guidelines. The detailed rules for the implementation of the tutor system in secondary schools may be formulated by the educational departments of each province in accordance with the three guidelines. (12) These guidelines will be implemented after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<h3>British University Dormitories are Insufficient; Colleges are Separately Relocated</h3>
<p>Students from Afar Pay Rice in National Currency</p>
<p>(Lishui Dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University has recently added new students. The existing dormitories are not sufficient to accommodate them. It has been decided to relocate the colleges separately to suitable locations. The College of Agriculture will be located in Songyang, and the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine will be located in Longshui. All students of the second year and above in each college will start classes at the aforementioned new locations. Also, because the houses in the three places still need to be repaired and constructed, and cannot be completed at the same time, it has been decided that the College of Agriculture and the College of Medicine and the agricultural training courses will start school on September 20 and start classes on the 25th. The College of Engineering will start school on October 1 and start classes on the 6th. The school has notified all old students separately. As for the freshmen of each college and the cooperative training courses, they will still have classes at the original site of the university in Lishui, and will all start school on September 15 and start classes on the 22nd. Freshmen must first receive freshman training when they enter the school. As for the rice needed by new and old students, the school previously notified all students to bring dried grains for payment when registering for school. Recently, in view of the difficulty of transportation, students in Lishui, Songyang, and counties with convenient transportation still need to pay grain, while students from other remote areas will temporarily pay 150 yuan in national currency (profit or loss will be compensated based on future grain price fluctuations). Students have also been notified uniformly.</p>

<h3>This Year's Western Union Football Tournament, Registration Closes Today</h3>
<p>Chinese League Likely to Fail</p>
<p>Registration for this year's Western Union Football Tournament was originally scheduled to close on the 5th of this month, but was postponed due to reasons. It will now close this afternoon. Those who wish to participate can complete the procedures at the association's office at No. 4, Room B, No. 119 Nanjing Road today. This year, due to the prohibition of matches between Chinese and Westerners by the police authorities of the two concessions, the association has changed the competition method and set up Chinese and Western championships respectively for competition. Among the Chinese teams that had previously registered, there were originally five or six teams, including Youyou, Park League, Yousheng, Hualian, and China Tobacco. Later, in view of the separate championships for Chinese and Western teams, lacking competitive interest, Youyou, Yousheng, Hualian, and China Tobacco Company and other teams have declared their withdrawal from the Western Union. Therefore, after the registration closes today, it is feared that the Chinese championship group will be announced to fail. It is reported that the Western participants in Group A include Western Police, French Merchants, St. Francis, North Western, Portugal, Racks, and the Jewish Association. The French Army, the champion of Group B last year, may be promoted to Group A. In addition, the Executive Committee of the Association is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon to review and approve the participating teams. At the same time, the participation of the three Western teams, North Western Children, the Jewish Association, and Portugal, in the Coco Cup mini-football charity match for the Poor Children's Education Institute will also be discussed.</p>

<h3>How to Study Today's Chinese Geography (3)</h3>
<p>— Tan Lian</p>
<p>It is said that the section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway (ie the Xukun Road) in Yunnan will be completed between summer and autumn. Some say it has been opened from Kunming to Xuanwei, and some say it has been opened to Qujing. I don't know which is correct. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway has been opened from Liujiang to Desheng. The Longhai Railway continues to be opened from Baoji to Tianshui. After sorting out, the Qianjiang River in the waterway has been opened between Sichuan and Guizhou. The Minjiang River has been actively repaired. Nine dams have been completed between Shaxi, Yong'an, and Ninghua, and the waterway is smooth. This is what should be studied in terms of transportation.</p>
<p>After the war, the Huai River Guidance Committee moved west to Sichuan to assist in improving water conservancy construction in the southwest, and cooperated with the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan water conservancy agencies and the provincial government to conduct surveys and designs as much as possible for the irrigated area. As a result, 2,165,000 mu of barren land have been turned into fertile fields. It is estimated that after one or two years, the canal construction will be completed in order, and 2.7 million mu of fertile fields can be added. Other Meihui canals in Shaanxi irrigate more than 13,000 mu of farmland, and the Weaver Girl Canal irrigates more than 10,000 mu of farmland. (The Jinghui Canal and Weihui Canal irrigate the widest fields, but they were not completed after the war, so they are not counted). The Tao Hui Canal in Gansu irrigates more than 30,000 mu of farmland. This is what should be studied in terms of water conservancy.</p>
<p>The entire operation depends on economic strength and productivity to support it. The increase in fertile fields after the implementation of irrigation in the free zone in agricultural production can be seen in the water conservancy section, and the increase in agricultural output can be seen. However, there are no accurate statistics on the output of rice and wheat for comparison. Guangxi Province produces less cotton. In the Republic of China, there were only 87,000 dan in 1937, 105,000 dan in 1939, and increased to 552,700 dan in 1940. Open spaces and barren fields have been turned into cotton fields. The provinces of Sichuan and Hunan produced about 1 million dan of cotton in 1937, which was equivalent in 1940. The minerals that have always been famous are tungsten in Jiangxi, antimony in Hunan, tin and copper in Yunnan, and mercury in Guizhou. After the war, the output of tungsten ore was under control and increased from 12,000 tons to 20,000 tons.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flowers, Many Rumors of Profit and Loss, Double Horses Create a Chaotic Situation, Speculation If Not Careful... Money in Your Pocket Flies Away</h3>
<p>The yarn market has returned to a chaotic state, fluctuating up and down, changing four times a day. This kind of scene is rare in recent times. It is conceivable that the speculators are distracted. In fact, the chips have increased, and the air is broadcast. Buying at any time, and financing at any time. In this way, the speculators' desire to make money is even stronger. There are people who make profits, but most of them are empty. The money in the pocket flew away. Initially, the Hong Kong gang has been delayed for a long time recently. The procurement activities in the past two days have made the bulls excited, and everyone is optimistic. Afterwards, rumors suddenly arose, saying that there was another ban on exports. The shorts were very active. The bulls, seeing the bad head, took the opportunity to slip away. The market was originally high-end, as long as bad words are said, the reaction will rise, and the market will go down. A child's double horse's high price is 1,775 yuan, and the low price is 1,753 yuan. The afternoon opening was mediocre, and the price was 1,743 yuan. Then it gradually rose, saying that the prohibition of exports conflicted with the interests of the Japanese businessmen and would not be realized. If it only refers to the free zone, the way out is limited, and it does not matter whether it is prohibited or not. Therefore, the buying sentiment was revived and rose to 1,768 yuan. However, the price was high, which aroused the praises. Before the close, it suddenly fell from 50 yuan to 40 yuan, straight down to 1,736 yuan. The situation was chaotic for a while. On the table, only hands stretched out, but some people came back to buy cheap goods and collected hundreds of packages, returning to 1,743 yuan to close the market. But after the close, the market rebounded and made to 1,747 yuan. Finally, it returned to 1,742-3 yuan. The exchange heard of this situation, and the cotton yarn had closed. The cotton cloth closed suddenly fell five-hole angles. In short, the price is already high, and the range of changes will naturally expand. However, the panic before the close is inevitable. This is because the floating accounts are fleeing for their lives.</p>
<p>The opening of Shuangma in the morning continued the strong momentum of the afternoon of the previous day. The first round jumped to 1,766 yuan. As soon as this price opened, everyone was shouting to enter. After a while, it rose to 1,775 yuan. However, a certain big player took advantage of the situation to spit out, and the table was loosened. It was said that the Guanggang trading was not as enthusiastic as the previous day, but it still handled more than 400 packages, so the popularity was still maintained. At 1,772 yuan, it was once seen to turn around. After 11 o'clock, the exchange closed suddenly fell by seven or eight yuan to more than ten yuan. The popularity was sluggish, and it was said that cotton yarn was prohibited from exporting. The selling momentum was strong, and it fell to 1,753 yuan to close the market. But after the close, the selling sound suddenly vibrated, and it went straight down to 1,738 yuan. The capital was not available. According to the half-day turnover statistics, 10,415 packages were made. The amount of each gang purchased is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Colleagues 10.000 Hong Kong 415</p>
<p>Statistics 10.415</p>
<p>The futures market situation of Jinshuangma, the rabbit rises and falls, and the trend is extremely chaotic. It is based on frequent rumors and anxieties. It is impossible to grasp whether it rises or falls. When the morning opened, initially, the US cotton continued to rise slightly, and the old factory orders still absorbed as always, so it rose first, and the short positions on period yarn were uneasy. Then, the hedging and buyers were extremely enthusiastic. Especially the exchange was also high, which further fueled the momentum of buyers. Therefore, October opened at 1,671 yuan, and it rose immediately. The long-term followed suit, and November reached a high price of 1,688 yuan. December was also 1,720 yuan, close to the peak. The near-term also rose to 1,675 yuan. After entering, suddenly the rumors were raging, and the factory orders saw a sharp drop first. The multi-party front seemed to be shaking. For a time, the rumors were spreading, and the yarn sellers were full. The near-term fell to 1,660 yuan, November fell to 1,677 yuan, and December suddenly fell sharply to 1,700 yuan in the afternoon. The afternoon closed down 4.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan. The afternoon still rose first and then fell. The feet of the land were affected by rumors, and it seemed that the rising trend had cracked. If the rumors can be confirmed, there may be a possibility of continued decline. As a result, October was 1,668 yuan, the closing price fell 1.5 yuan, November was 1,683 yuan, because it had closed, it was still good for one yuan, and December was 1,710 yuan, only 7.5 yuan. Here is a list of the market prices that have been touched.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Cheap Sale of US Loan Cotton Will Lower the Entire Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The order transaction of foreign cotton foreign companies in this port has been affected by the US government's cheap sale of loan public cotton. The entire cotton market has a tendency to continue to decline. Although the current order transaction is quite difficult due to the required procedures, and there is little hope, but with the cheap selling price, the demand for goods from all parties is undoubtedly very eager, which is a good opportunity to try to purchase in large quantities. As for the current cotton situation, because there are not many sources, and all parties are interested in purchasing, at the same time, some factories have no way to directly order foreign cotton, and turn to purchase current cotton. Therefore, although the market situation is slightly soft due to the decline in foreign cotton markets, there is no sign of a sharp decline.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to speculative buying of counter-action theory and absorption by the industry, and then fell due to the large number of bulls taking profits. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day, ranging from five to six pounds.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to brokers' replenishment and purchases by European exporters, and then fell back due to floating profits. Yesterday's closing price fell by two to eight robies each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be bearish (0.2.5 robies).</p>
<p>Another message, the current cotton market continued to be firm in the morning. The price of Indian cotton has reached a new peak. The public sees that the sea stock is not thick, and the orders are very difficult, so they try to absorb it. However, the cotton market changed suddenly in the afternoon, and people's minds were slightly hit. The transaction market is still tight with coarse cotton, and the future is unpredictable.</p>

<h3>Finance, Chao Gang Absorbs, Cash Rise is Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was squeezed. Affected by the suspension of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate for the offset of legal currency in Hong Kong, the October period was only one yuan high or low. The final squeeze was only one yuan. About 100 taels of the transaction were concluded, and the price was 6,892-3 yuan. Re-seeing the stagnation, the cash rise gradually became stronger. The Jin Hao Xianghe resumed its advance, and the Chaozhou gang of the silver building industry also absorbed it. Since the first transaction was seen at 9:50 in the morning, Yongfengyu first sold 40 taels to Tianyuan, and the price was 9,050 yuan, which was 30 yuan higher. The Russian saw Dafeng 10 yuan lower and sold 20 taels to Chengdada for 9,040 yuan. Tianyuan returned 10 taels to Wanfeng, and the price was reduced to 9,030 yuan. The silver building gang and the Jin Hao suddenly came to compete, and they immediately raised 30 yuan. Xianghe entered Taikangrun 20 taels, and Xintianda each entered Dafeng 50 yuan, and Xiangxingyong entered Tianyuan 10 taels, all for 9,060 yuan. Yangqing and entered Taikangrun 10 taels for 9,070 yuan. Xiangxingyong re-entered Xinyuan 10 taels, and the price rose to 9,075 yuan at noon. No transaction was seen later, and the price was squeezed up 55 yuan compared to the last price of the previous day. The same day was 45 yuan high or low, and the transaction was two hundred and several taels. The market price of Jinmen brand gold was 9,100 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday, and the jewelry gold was also listed at 10 yuan higher, totaling 930 yuan.</p>
<p>The future has become a dead market</p>
<p>Ha Chi October period per piece (ten taels), opened at 9:15, first by Tianyuan selling 20 taels to Jufengyong for 6,893 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher. Then Yu and Yong exited Hongqingyong 30 taels for 6,892 yuan. Later, it tended to be stagnant and settled. Until noon, the above price closed, and the difference was only one yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Ornamental gold is listed at 10 yuan</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments per tael in the silver building, Datonghang and Xintonghang, were both listed at 10 yuan higher at 10:30, which was 930 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Exchange Rate Bulls and Bears, Engaged in Mutual Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listings were flat, the HSBC small counter sandalwood price was stagnant, the British and American exchange black market was tight. However, the French Banque de l'Indochine still had selling positions, and the price was 4.625 yuan. There were many Chinese speculators who squeezed each other, and the price was initially 4.8125 and 75 yuan. The Chinese bulls were squeezed. The Chinese banks and the fourteen British and American commercial banks have a unified method, squeezing and selling to foreign banks at 4.875 yuan, and selling to Chinese banks at 4.9375 yuan. The underground activity of importers who are not allowed to apply has weakened, so the US dollar was received at 4.6875, long 0625, and there was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 24th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened smoothly this morning, and there was no prosperity in each exchange rate. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 24th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened flat this morning, and the London telegraphic transfer was tight at 0625, which was two pence 875. The New York telegraphic transfer was unchanged and still stood at 4.875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 50 cents to 86 yuan. The "United Banknote" dark market was 75 cents higher at 47.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumors that the Listing will Lengthen, the US Dollar's Decline Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the British, American, and gold pounds and British gold tickets were quite stable, and the market price was stable. The US gold ticket continued to trend downward, and once Hong was 21.5 yuan, and the final price was 21.7 yuan, which was still 35 cents lower than the previous day. It is said that the HSBC bank listing may be lengthened. The Hong Kong summary is in need, and the market price has risen slightly by 5 cents. The Japanese gold ticket and the Korean ticket have both trended slightly higher. The former has risen to 2.37 yuan, and the latter has risen to 2.07 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food, Rice Merchants' Psychology is Different, Hoping for Something to Happen in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>A few foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Yihua Foreign Company Yisheng Wheel arrived in port yesterday morning and carried 500 packages of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It was berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is reported that the Detada Wheel of Hualun Foreign Company carried a large amount of foreign rice from Yangon to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive at the end of the month. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>The rice market continues to see a rising trend. Because the Far East is tense, the rice merchants are all excited. The buying sentiment was strong in the early morning. The football business took the opportunity to take advantage of it, throwing it back and forth. There are also real sales activities in this street and villages. The two advances together, stimulating the shouts, and the market feels firmer. When the bank opened the small twisted 113 yuan, the outer stack 112 and a half yuan, which was more than 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. Other high-quality Siamese, etc., also opened at 113 and a half yuan, 113 yuan, ordinary 110 yuan, high-quality Saigon No. 1 opened at 125 yuan, No. 2 opened at 114-5 yuan, Zhongguan Yuan Bai Mindang opened at 115-6 yuan, crushed tip opened at 85-6 yuan, eggplant Buddha rice opened at 120 yuan, and second opened at 115 yuan. After this leap, there were profitable floating accounts that took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, resulting in a soft return in a moment. If the bank stack small twisted once depreciated and sold for 111 and a half yuan, 111 yuan, and the outer stack second goods for 110 yuan, but the market changes are unpredictable. It is impossible to predict that after a fall, it will lead to a resurgence of off-market customers to absorb. For a time, the situation turned tight again, and the prices recovered to the early market again, but although there were many changes to this point, it was difficult to produce new prices. Later, it only wandered all the way, and often entered and exited around the early market until the market closed. However, that was all. Yinghua Company 135 yuan to 138 yuan, second 132 yuan, 工部局小絞 224 pounds is 142 yuan 75 cents,成交 一萬七千包,又一千多噸,</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick japonica rice has become scarce again, most of the lodgers have turned their eyes and paid attention to foreign rice, resulting in a desolate transaction and forming a situation of no honor and no shame. The opening price is similar to the previous one, with Nangang Zao Po still selling for 149 yuan to 147 yuan, Wuxi special thick broken japonica selling for 155 yuan, and Pudong new japonica selling for 153 and a half yuan to 153 yuan.</p>

However, the market suddenly spread news that the customs had banned exports, and people's minds were turbulent, and the signs of a soft return were seen. As a result, a part of the white goods still rose by half a corner per piece, and the bleaching and dyeing cloth was flat. 500 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street, and 600 pieces of blue cloth twill bleached cloth were transacted by the Cantonese, Hong Kong and Southeast Asian gangs, and 40-50 pieces of coarse cloth were transacted by the Zhoudong Dinghai gang.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Tea Dumped in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The price of Dai-dai Flowers is unusually high.</p>
<p>Since the UK and US froze Sino-Japanese funds, tea trade between Japan and the US has completely stopped. In recent weeks, a number of Japanese mainland and Taiwanese teas, no less than 20,000 boxes, have been continuously shipped to Shanghai for dumping. However, due to sluggish sales in foreign firms, there is no major outlet. Currently, the only tea transactions in the market are from the Tianjin merchants, who still show interest in items such as "Xiumei" tea tips. Yesterday, over 230 dan were traded, with "Xiumei" selling for 175-176 yuan and tea tips for 150 yuan. Today, 383 pieces of tea are being shipped to Hong Kong. As the route for Japanese tea to the US has been blocked, Chinese merchants are mixing Japanese tea for sale to the US, and sales from shops and firms are quite strong. Therefore, with supply exceeding demand, tea prices are gradually decreasing. Only the "Dai-dai Flower," usually a garnish for tea, is extraordinarily expensive this year. Tea shops are selling it for 1.4 yuan per tael, equivalent to 2,600 yuan per dan, a truly unprecedented price. Fortunately, those who use "Dai-dai Flower" to flavor tea are typically wealthy and leisure, so the high price is of little concern.</p>

<h3>The Post-Market Outlook for Dalian Sunflower Seeds is Weak</h3>

<h3>Settlement and Reporting for Export Goods: Approval to Obtain Exchange Rate Difference; Exemption from Export and Transit Taxes; Government to Bear Exchange Settlement Fees; Foreign Exchange for Twelve Major Categories of Native Goods to be Given at Designated Banks</h3>
<p>Previously, the reason why the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai was so rampant was, on the one hand, the activities of certain banks and importers, but on the other hand, the freedom for exporters to throw the foreign exchange they obtained into the black market, ensuring a constant supply, was the real reason. However, the authorities had stipulated that when goods were transported for export from other ports, foreign exchange should first be settled at the original port of entry, but due to various reasons, this was not thoroughly implemented. Furthermore, the Central Bank and Bank of Communications in Shanghai were unable to undertake export settlement matters due to environmental constraints. Now, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated the "Measures for Settlement and Reporting of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement," showing a determination to remedy the situation. The measures are extremely stringent, with a total of twenty articles, designating twelve major categories of native goods for which foreign exchange should be legally given to designated banks, allowing exporters to receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank and Bank of Communications, and exempting export taxes and transit taxes. The fees for handling the settlement of foreign exchange are borne by the government. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement</p>
<p>Measures for Settlement and Reporting of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement, Article 1: The types of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are designated as twelve categories: egg products, feathers, sausage casings, leather, fur, dyes, medicinal materials, oils and waxes, nuts, timber, silk cocoons, and hemp. The detailed product names are specified separately in the "Detailed List of Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement." Article 2: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are exported and sold, whether transported and sold by government trade organizations or traded independently by commercial firms, they must sell and settle foreign exchange to the China or Bank of Communications (or the banks entrusted by these two banks) at the legal exchange rate and obtain a purchase of foreign exchange certificate for reporting. Those farmers and vendors who carry goods on their shoulders to the foreign markets along the land and sea borders and whose total weight is less than 30 kilograms and value does not exceed 50 yuan in national currency are allowed to export without foreign exchange settlement. Article 3: The types of foreign exchange settlement for export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are first calculated by the Trade Commission or its designated agency based on foreign market prices. Foreign market prices are based on local market prices, plus all transportation and sales costs and a profit margin of 11%, and are estimated in foreign currency converted at the rates quoted by the China and Bank of Communications. The sale of goods shall be calculated according to the prices stated in the contract for the sale of goods. Then, the China or Bank of Communications, according to the estimated amount in the preceding paragraph and after completing the foreign exchange settlement guarantee procedures with the merchants, shall issue a purchase of foreign exchange certificate.</p>
<p>Measures for Reporting Various Goods for Settlement</p>
<p>Article 4: When export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are reported for shipment, the customs post (or cargo inspection office) at the place of departure (or the first customs post (or cargo inspection office) along the transport route) shall verify the purchase of foreign exchange certificate before releasing the goods, and affix a seal on the purchase of foreign exchange certificate, indicating the date of reporting and the customs declaration number, and affix a seal on the customs declaration, indicating the purchase of foreign exchange certificate number and the name of the issuing bank. The aforementioned purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be registered in detail by the customs (or cargo inspection office) with its number, the name, grade, weight, and number of pieces of the goods issued by the bank, as well as the reported weight, number of pieces, date of reporting, etc., and then returned to the merchant. If there are any unreported goods in the certificate, when continuing to report for shipment later, the previous registration situation should be compared, and the reported quantity should be checked before release, and the customs declaration should be stamped and annotated according to the regulations. Article 5: After the export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are shipped, the customs posts (or cargo inspection offices) along the way shall check the purchase of foreign exchange certificate or the number of the purchase of foreign exchange certificate annotated on the customs declaration before releasing the goods. When the goods reach the last customs post (or cargo inspection office) within the national border, the purchase of foreign exchange certificate must be checked before export is allowed.</p>
<p>Eighty Percent of Retail Exchange Amount Settled</p>
<p>Article 6: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are mailed abroad, the post office shall verify the purchase of foreign exchange certificate before accepting the mailing. If the weight of the goods is less than 3 kilograms and the value does not exceed 50 yuan in national currency, it shall be treated as a sample, and the purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be exempted from inspection for acceptance. However, for postal delivery by the Hong Kong Fuhua Trading Company, the transfer fee shall be borne by the Trade Commission, and to prevent evasion of foreign exchange settlement, all postal packages must be inspected by the post office for the type of goods, and then sealed and posted by the sender in person. The post office shall refuse to accept packages that have been sealed without inspection. Article 7: Within ten days of the sale of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement, the person must submit the transaction documents and request the Trade Commission or its designated agency to verify the actual amount of the sale proceeds and issue a certificate of actual sale price, based on which foreign exchange shall be settled with the bank that issued the purchase of foreign exchange certificate or its foreign correspondent bank. Article 8: The amount of foreign exchange to be settled for settlement goods shall be calculated according to 80% of the retail exchange amount stated in the certificate of retail price. The remaining 20% shall be allowed for the merchant to deduct for foreign currency expenses such as insurance, storage, and transportation required for foreign sales operations. If the goods are transported from the southwestern provinces and must pass through foreign ports, and the required foreign currency expenses are particularly high, a request may be made when applying for the certificate of retail price, and the supporting documents shall be submitted to the Trade Commission or its designated agency for transfer to the Ministry of Finance for appropriate reduction of the exchange settlement percentage, but limited to a reduction to 70% of the retail exchange amount.</p>
<p>Obtaining the Difference and Exempting Taxes</p>
<p>Article 9: After the merchant settles the foreign exchange with the China or Bank of Communications at the legal exchange rate, the legal currency that should be obtained shall be paid by the bank at the designated inland location with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange. Article 10: The merchant shall receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the bank from the settlement bank based on the foreign exchange settlement documents, and the legal currency shall be paid at the designated inland location by the original settlement bank with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange. Article 11: The fees that the bank should receive for handling the settlement procedures for merchants shall be borne by the government and need not be paid by the merchant. Article 12: All goods exported with foreign exchange settlement shall be exempt from export tax. The measures for paying taxes on transit within the country before export shall still be handled in accordance with the current customs regulations. Article 13: Export goods that have been settled for foreign exchange shall not be restricted for transit and sale in the interior. However, if the sales location is in a land area close to the coastline, such as a national border or a war zone, within a hundred li, the merchant shall obtain a license application form for domestic sales from the construction department or trade commission agency of the province of sale and submit it to the department or agency for thorough verification and transfer to the Trade Commission for application to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a domestic sales license, based on which the goods shall be reported for transport or mailing. The interpretation of the aforementioned war zone shall be in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Blocking Traffic in War Zones formulated by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Entry into Shanghai Must be Reviewed</p>
<p>Article 14: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are transited and sold within the restricted area in the preceding article, a certificate issued by the county government or quality trade commission agency of the county of sale shall be used as the basis for reporting transport or mailing. Article 15: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are transited for domestic sale, and the transportation route is by sea or must cross the land border and enter the interior for sale, foreign exchange shall first be settled according to the regulations, and a purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be obtained for reporting. After arrival at the destination, a domestic sales certificate shall be allowed for inspection, and an application shall be made to the Trade Commission to request the Ministry of Finance to cancel the foreign exchange settlement. Article 16: Those who mail export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement with a special domestic sales certificate shall follow Articles 13 and 14 and shall not be subject to the restrictions of Article 15. Article 17: Export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement that are prohibited items shall absolutely not be transported to the prohibited area, except for transport to the Shanghai concession area, which shall be handled in accordance with the revised measures for reviewing the transport of prohibited items to Shanghai. The interpretation of the aforementioned prohibited area shall be in accordance with the provisions of the various items of Article 2 of the Regulations on Prohibited Items.</p>
<p>Confiscation and Punishment for Violators</p>
<p>Article 18: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are found to have failed to comply with the provisions of these measures and lack the necessary documents, but there is no intent to smuggle, they shall be ordered to submit the supplementary documents for verification and release. If there is indeed an intent to smuggle, they shall be treated as smuggled goods, and the customs (or cargo inspection office) shall impose penalties in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations and may confiscate the goods. If the aforementioned smuggled goods are found by the designated cargo inspection agency, they shall be immediately transferred to the nearby customs or cargo inspection office for handling in accordance with the regulations.

<h3>Fifty People Arrested in Hangzhou and Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," based on information from the Japanese side, the Japanese military police in Hangzhou arrested fifty secret agents in the city yesterday (the 23rd) suspected of planning activities and seized a large amount of explosives, firearms, and ammunition. These fifty people have now been handed over to the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai for detention and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Sudden Erection of Iron Netting Alert in Front of the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Japanese military police unit on Penglai Road in Nanshi suddenly erected newly manufactured wire mesh on the east, west, and south sides of the entrance, forming a passage for vehicles and pedestrians, and added sentry posts in the gate fortress, implementing strict security measures.</p>
<p>###谋福常德等轮被扣谋福、常德等轮被扣、各领再提交涉</p>
<p>謀福·常德·寳利·阿維瑪利·等輪、被日方扣留後、阿維瑪利號則已釋放多日、其他各輪、現悉已由各該國領事準備再向日方交涉、迅予釋放、以利航商、茲聞日方或可於最短期間內釋放、</p>

<h3>It is rumored that Chinese, British, and American textile factories will receive legal foreign exchange, which will greatly facilitate the arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," it was reported yesterday (the 23rd) that the Stabilization Fund will supply foreign exchange to textile manufacturing factories in Shanghai at the official exchange rate, with the exception of Japanese-owned textile factories.</p>
<p>Not Yet Confirmed</p>
<p>However, this statement has not yet been officially confirmed. According to several bankers interviewed by the reporter, recent documents stated that cotton was one of the imported goods for which Shanghai importers could apply for foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund in September. If the rumors are true, it will greatly benefit Chinese, British, and American textile merchants here.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Excluded</p>
<p>Excluding Japanese merchants should not be considered discrimination, as the Japanese authorities have effectively monopolized all raw cotton production in the occupied areas. As a result of the monopoly, Chinese, British, and American textile merchants in Shanghai have had great difficulty in obtaining the necessary raw materials for many months. The rumored new regulations will greatly facilitate the arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Problems with Film Rental Fees</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Shanghai cinemas are in imminent danger of being completely forced to close because the Stabilization Fund is not allowing the supply of foreign exchange to pay for foreign film rental fees, and cinemas will be unable to obtain new films. According to a major film merchant, if foreign exchange cannot be obtained, the source of new films will be completely cut off. If cinemas are forced to close, the losses suffered by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be a shortfall of one million yuan in annual revenue, and at the same time, it will exacerbate the unemployment problem. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war four years ago, films have been the only means of relieving the mental suffering of the people, and the loss of this legitimate entertainment is a great tragedy. Film merchants are currently convening meetings to discuss solutions.</p>

<h3>Claiming to be Relatives of Hardoon, Requesting Inheritance of His Estate, Engaging Japanese Lawyer to Write to Luo Jialing, Target Amounting to Over 43.7 Million</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," after the death of Jewish real estate magnate Hardoon in Shanghai about ten years ago, whose estate was worth 4 million pounds, a major lawsuit ensued, and Hardoon's wife, Luo Jialing, won the case.

<p>Did Not Reply</p>
<p>The ten people claiming to inherit Hardoon's estate stated that the initial value of the estate was 4 million pounds, but now, due to the high price of real estate and increased income, its current estimated value is approximately 70 million yuan. According to the law, they should receive 62.5% of the entire estate, amounting to approximately 43.7 million yuan. The English-language "Great American Evening Post" also reported that the matter has not yet been brought to court, as it is believed that an amicable resolution can be reached on its own.</p>

The largest shipment of foreign rice this week, totaling 60,000 bags, is scheduled to be carried to Shanghai by the "North European Merchant" flying the Panamanian flag next Sunday. This ship is sailing from Yangon via Singapore and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. The foreign rice it carries was purchased by the Shanghai Public Granary Committee, but no decision has been made on how to dispose of this batch of foreign rice. According to the committee, it has been selling large quantities of foreign rice at subsidized prices in recent weeks.</p>
<h3>New Park Opened at the Intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Ratard</h3>
<p>Opening in Mid-November, Passes for the French Park are Valid</p>
<p>It is learned that the Public Works Department of the French Municipal Council has hired workers over the past two weeks to clean and level the site of the former Hong Kee Coal Mine Company at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Ratard in order to plant flowers and trees and open it as a park. According to the Municipal Council yesterday, although the new park is small, it will be planted with various rare flowers and trees. The opening date has not yet been determined, but it is expected to be in November. At that time, visitors with passes for the French Park's Parc Heude will be able to enter and visit. There are several small hills that will be preserved. A large part of the park will be developed as a children's park, equipped with swings and other playground equipment. It has not yet been decided whether to open a tennis court in the park. According to the person in charge, the establishment of the park aims to provide a place for nearby residents to relax in their spare time.</p>
<h3>震旦博物院 蝴蝶 Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Aurora Museum on Rue Lupan will hold an exhibition of insect specimens from September 1st, which will expire at the end of this month. It is hoped that all sectors of society will visit as soon as possible. From October 1st, a butterfly specimen exhibition will begin, with more than a thousand types, bright colors, and various sizes. In addition to collecting from all parts of the country, butterflies from the United States, Britain, India, and Japan will also be displayed at that time. This type of exhibition is rare in Shanghai. The museum is temporarily keeping live insects, and mineral specimens are currently being sorted and will be displayed soon. The antique room displays various ancient artifacts from various dynasties, including ancient Yi tripods, funerary clay figures from past dynasties, burial objects, Zhou Dynasty Yi grand bells, Ming Dynasty Zun pots, bronze bottles, Jian carvings, ancient mirrors, screen inserts, a large screen depicting the 108 heroes of Liangshan, the true body of Huang Anguo, a former Qing Dynasty official in Chongming, wearing posthumous court attire, and ancient coins from various dynasties donated to the museum by Ding Fubao, all on display in the antique room for all to visit.

<h3>Embargoed Goods to the Free Zone The Customs Will Implement It from Today Hong Kong is Allowed to Ship but Must Increase Taxes Normal Trade Will Suffer Major Obstacles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an advertisement was found in the North-China Daily News, stating that from September 25th, all export goods from Shanghai are prohibited from being shipped to any ports or cities in non-occupied areas. However, the advertisement did not specify which areas were considered non-occupied. It is said that the purpose is to prohibit all goods from Shanghai from being transported to the Chinese free zone. However, this announcement was not issued by the Jianghai Customs. Yesterday morning, the customs still claimed to be unaware of the matter. It was not until 2:00 PM that they received documents related to this matter. It is understood that the customs will implement it from today due to environmental pressures, but goods shipped to Hong Kong are temporarily not prohibited from export, only their taxes will be increased. After the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds on July 26th, the Japanese tax official of the customs stipulated that more than a dozen types of goods were prohibited from export to foreign countries (excluding Japan) and the Chinese free zone as a retaliatory measure. This time, the prohibition of goods from being transported to the free zone will only cause another type of obstacle and restriction to Shanghai's normal trade. Yesterday, the market price of cotton yarn plummeted amid soaring prices, probably also due to this impact.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital Chinese Donations</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's August report shows 20,123 outpatient visits. The hospital's work is of concern to society, and therefore it has seen increased progress. This can be seen from the following donations to the bed fund: Victor Victor donated 7,000 yuan, Li Shuxiong donated a million yuan, and the Yang Meinan Memorial Fund donated 16,000 yuan. This donated fund is used for the minimum free hospitalization and treatment of poor patients. Since the last report, general donations to the hospital from the Chinese community have also been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, the total amount of donations from the Chinese community has reached 42,000 yuan, accounting for about 45% of the total donations, setting a new record in the hospital's history.</p>
<h3>Liu Chongyou Passes Away</h3>
<p>Liu Chongyou, styled Songsheng, came from a prominent family in Minhou, Fujian. He was a member of the first National Assembly, upright and honest, and renowned for his time. He lived in Peiping and declined to enter politics, practicing law instead. In the past decade, he moved to Shanghai and continued to practice law. Unexpectedly, he fell ill half a year ago and passed away at 8:00 PM on the 33rd of this month. The funeral is scheduled for today at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor.</p>

<h3>News from the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>Translation of Statistical Methods Published Statistical Methods, written by Professor Mills, a modern American authority on statistics, is the most suitable elementary textbook for students of statistics. It has been published for more than ten years and its reputation has not diminished. Many universities in our country also use it. This book focuses on the study of economic and commercial statistical methods, with thorough theories and attention to practical examples, which can help to draw inferences about other cases. It also repeatedly emphasizes the limitations of statistical measures in application. There has never been a Chinese version of this book in our country. Now, Professors Li Huang Xiaozhen and Lu Zongwei have jointly translated it into Chinese based on the original edition of September 1935, based on their years of experience in teaching statistics. It is published by the Zhonghua Book Company as a university textbook for the company. At the end of the book, the statistical translation names compiled by the Chinese Statistical Society are attached, which is very convenient for scholars to compare. The whole book has more than 500 pages and the actual price is 12 yuan and 48 cents.</p>
<p>Central Bank English Quarterly The autumn issue has been published, including Minister Weng's "Industrial Construction of Free China", Mr. Fox's "Financial Problems of China During the War", Mr. Chen Bingzhang's "Strengthening China's Financial System During the War", Mr. Meng Changyong's "Review of China's Land Tax Reform", Mr. Geng Aidu's "On Chinese Finance", Mr. Lin Yijin's "Commercial Banks in China During the War", and Mr. Ye Zonggao's "Rural Construction of Free China".

<h3>Ticket Sellers Don't Skim</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>In the past few days, who in Shanghai hasn't been talking about the streetcar ticket seller skimming and shoving a passenger to their death? It so happened that a friend who had returned from studying in the United States was present that day. I jokingly said to him, "Do ticket sellers in the United States skim?" Unexpectedly, he replied, "Ticket sellers on public transportation in the United States never skim!" I was taken aback, thinking that this friend had also joined the "foreign moon is brighter" group, and was about to criticize him when he continued, "Because they can't skim."</p>
<p>It turns out that in major American cities like New York or Boston, subway entrances at stations are equipped with automatic turnstiles. Each passenger must first insert the fare into a machine before entering. Because the fare is uniform, you can ride to your destination after entering. After you leave the station, you have to pay the fare again to re-enter. In this type of vehicle, there is no need for a ticket seller at all. Without a ticket seller, how can skimming exist?</p>
<p>But what's strange is that on buses with ticket sellers, their ticket sellers also don't skim. Because there are few types of fares (usually only two: short distance and long distance), selling tickets is also convenient. Their method is that passengers directly insert the fare into a money box, without it passing through the ticket seller's hands. The ticket seller's responsibility is only to punch the ticket and give change.</p>
<p>So ticket sellers not skimming is not an empty ideal, but something that can be done. Of course, we don't want the company to immediately switch to machine payment to eradicate skimming, causing the majority of ticket sellers to lose their jobs. But we believe that after stabilizing the ticket sellers' lives, implementing appropriate education, and changing the ticket selling procedure, ticket seller skimming may become a historical relic.</p>

<h3>Chemical Pencil for Identifying Counterfeit Coins</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>When silver coins are circulating in the market, identifying counterfeit coins is a major problem. American police authorities have put a lot of effort into educating the public on how to identify counterfeit banknotes, even opening special classes to conduct widespread publicity and teaching. Recently, scientists have invented a chemical pencil that is very helpful for identifying silver coins. The method is to first scrape the surface of the "silver" coin to be identified with a knife, then moisten the tip of the chemical pencil and dab it on the coin's surface. If the coin is counterfeit, a black spot will immediately appear on the coin's surface. If it is a genuine coin, there will be no black spot.</p>

<h3>News Reporter's Blindfold Method</h3>
<p>— Si Zhong</p>
<p>When Hitler's blitzkrieg unfolded in the Netherlands, the Dutch authorities kept their mouths shut, strictly censoring the news, and not allowing any reporters to disclose news of the war. However, the New York Tribune's Amsterdam reporter, Kangqi, sent a cleverly worded telegram, conveying the real news to the newspaper. His telegram read: "Everything is peaceful in the Netherlands, the same as the situation around New Orleans, Louisiana around June 1st." Based on this telegram, the New York Tribune published the shocking news that "German troops invaded the Netherlands and the Dutch breached the dikes," making other newspapers pale in comparison. The Dutch news censors couldn't see through the mystery in that report, but the astute newspaper editors were able to find the truth between the lines. It turned out that the so-called "situation around New Orleans, Louisiana around June 1st" meant that the Mississippi River had breached its dikes, and the surrounding area had become a swamp. The Netherlands had become a swamp, so it must have been caused by breaching the dikes, and then the German invasion was self-evident.</p>
<p>When Lenin was critically ill, the news reporters from various countries stationed in Moscow encountered a difficult problem. If Lenin died, the Soviet Russian government would not allow any reporters to publish the news abroad before announcing it to the people of their own country. The Soviet Russian government might temporarily keep the death a secret to avoid domestic changes.</p>
<p>London Hausted's reporter Levin was returning home at that time. He and the newspaper agreed that if Lenin died, he would send a telegram asking the newspaper to remit 150 pounds. After Lenin died, the news censors indeed intercepted all telegrams reporting this event, so Levin followed the original agreement and requested a remittance. Unfortunately, the newspaper authorities forgot the secret agreement and replied, "Overdraft already high, unable to comply," thus missing a great opportunity to cause a worldwide sensation.</p>
<p>During the war between the United States and Spain, American soldiers stationed on Guantanamo Island suddenly contracted an epidemic of yellow fever, causing morale to plummet. The US government immediately censored the news and did not allow the news to be transmitted off the island. The New York Sun's chief reporter reported the actions of colleagues at his station, and the content of the telegram was unremarkable. He said: "All colleagues at this station are safe. Anderson is going to Kingston. Lloyd is here. Jack Ochre is with the army on Guantanamo Island. Li Quexun is in the camp." The mystery in this telegram lies entirely in the words Jack Ochre, because the English nickname for yellow fever is "Yellow Jack." "Ochre" means "red clay" or "gold coin." A few minutes later, the American newspaper published shocking news with the headline "Yellow fever is raging on Guam, affecting countless soldiers."</p>

<h3>Marching Speed</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>According to recent German claims, their army can march at a rate of twelve miles a day for sixteen days. This is truly an extremely high speed.</p>
<p>The American army considers marching fourteen miles a day to be good, and marching sixteen miles is an exception. But historically, there have indeed been several glorious records of marching speed. When besieging the place of Chugevia, Caesar's troops marched fifty miles in one day; fought a battle, and then turned back the next day. In 1806, when Napoleon attacked Prussia, his best soldiers marched at a rate of thirty-three miles a day for thirteen consecutive days. The world's highest marching record, however, still belongs to Alexander the Great, who, after the Battle of Arbela in 331 BC, ordered his army to strive forward, marching at a rate of thirty-six and a half miles a day for eleven consecutive days.</p>
<p>Similar to Hitler's current marching situation in attacking Russia, we can compare it to the American Civil War. At that time, when General Sherman marched through Georgia, he also brought a large number of military equipment and food. Sherman's troops could only march twelve miles a day, which is ten miles less than Hitler.</p>

<p>12 Unexpected Turbulence</p>
<p>At about half past nine, they suddenly heard the sound of someone banging on the door across the street, followed by unclear voices. Gradually, the sound grew louder, and it seemed that several people were arguing. Before long, the two sides began to fight. Qiu Haitang and Old Master Zhang could clearly hear the sounds of Old Shopkeeper Meng and two or three other people being thrown to the ground. Later, there was a burst of extremely rapid running sounds, from south to north, as fast as horses, and there were more than just one or two people's footsteps.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's bad! They've snatched Lin Sheng away...!" Immediately, they heard Old Shopkeeper Meng howling like a pig being slaughtered on the street, and it sounded like two people chasing after them one after the other.</p>
<p>The street suddenly became lively: first, Young Shopkeeper Meng of the Meng family was crying and scolding, followed by the neighbors on the left and right coming out to inquire. Old Shopkeeper Meng was still complaining that his employees were not trying hard enough, and everyone's voices became a clamor.</p>
<p>"This is terrible! Second Young Master is really going to cause trouble!" With someone as clever as Qiu Haitang, he already understood five or six tenths of what was happening after listening to this scene next door; he just couldn't figure out why Yu Kun wanted to gather people together to kidnap the Meng family's young shopkeeper.</p>
<p>But this point became completely clear the next morning.</p>
<p>"Brother Wu, I'm really sorry to disturb you so early!" At about seven o'clock in the morning, the Meng family came over in a rush, standing in front of Qiu Haitang's kang in a state of panic. Old Shopkeeper Meng was the first to clasp his hands and said to him in a pitiful voice: "It's really because some strangers came last night, it seems that there was some trouble with Lin Sheng, and as soon as they opened the door, they started arguing with us.

<h3>A Few Words After Listening to Ge Nenniang's Opening Piece</h3>
<p>— Guo Yi</p>
<p>I am fond of ballad singing, but I rarely know people in this field. I am quite close with Xu Xuexing, and we have become increasingly familiar over time. I like his integrity and straightforwardness, which is different from the accumulated habits of the Jianghu. Xuexing brought his female disciples Xuelou, Xuehua, Xuemei, Xuefang, and his son Xuemen, to Shanghai to sing ballads, and more than a year has passed. Xuelou's eloquence is quick, and she is good at describing the characters in the book; Xuehua's singing voice is melodious and pleasant, and her reputation is very famous, and it has not declined for a long time. And the beauty of the opening pieces is especially well-known to the public. Most of Xuexing's opening pieces are written by our clan member, Master Zhi'an. The lyrics are elegant, with the meaning of poetry, and mixed with dialogue, making them even more subtle and vivid, with twists and turns, so that listeners do not find them long and only fear that they will end quickly. Zhi'an is proficient in Kunqu Opera, and his compilation of opening pieces has a legendary atmosphere. It is indeed so outstanding, but Xuexing does not easily give it to him. Xuexing's opening pieces are therefore uniquely superior. Yesterday, I happened to go to the Nanjing bookstore, and Xuexing specially ordered Xuelou and others to sing Ge Nenniang's opening piece to entertain me, which is Zhi'an's recent work. Zhi'an has been compiling this opening piece for them to sing for several months, but I still heard it for the first time. — In this opening piece, in addition to Xuelou and Xuehua, Xuemei, Xuefang, and Xuemen also appear on stage, with a colorful and lively atmosphere. Xuelou plays Sun Wugong, Xuehua plays Ge Nenniang, Xuemen plays Bolo, and Xuemei and Xuefang play the female soldiers. Each sings with their own expressions and spirits. Xuemei, Xuefang, and Xuemen are only thirteen or fourteen years old, but they are already very skilled, which is truly rare. The whole piece is filled with words of loyalty, righteousness, and martyrdom, and it is very inspiring and encouraging. Zhi'an has a deep heart, and even when playing with writing, he is not just doing it casually. I especially like the female soldiers' dialogue: "The place where we live today is still the territory of the Ming Dynasty, so how can you say that the country is dead? How unambitious!" Those who climb the New Pavilion and lament the difficulties of the country, will they know to strive after hearing this? According to Ge Nenniang's deeds, only three or four hundred words are recorded in the Banhiao Miscellany. Other notes do not seem to mention her. How many women in ancient and modern times have the same integrity as Ge Nenniang? And Ge Nenniang is praised by a drama, so her virtue is as clear as the sun and the moon. Now Zhi'an is also working hard to write and spread it like this, how lucky is Ge Nenniang to have this? However, to promote education and uphold morality, and to use this to inspire people all over the world, this kind of writing is essential, so why be afraid of Ge Nenniang's spread and exaggeration?</p>

<p>Zhang Yunhua and Juewen, etc., are cousins, and among the three brothers, he gets along best with Juemin. However, Juehui's love interest is a servant girl from a different class, whose name is Mingfeng, who has been serving everyone in the Gao family since she was a child. In terms of status, they already have the secret that they cannot be together, but Juehui believes that the so-called boundaries between master and servant can be broken. As for Juewen, although he is already married on the surface, and is very affectionate with his wife Li Ruijue, there is a hidden pain buried in his heart, because before he got married, he was in love with his cousin — Mei. They originally had an agreement with each other, but later, due to family discord, Mei was married off by her parents, and Juewen was also engaged to Miss Li by his grandfather. Since he had no power to resist, he had to obey. But his life became even more depressed. He also knew that this big family was bound to collapse sooner or later. So when the old grandfather Gao gave them a lesson, the three brothers had their own thoughts and were not very convinced.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: A Crown-Rushing Fury for a Crimson Beauty</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu then invited Bai Shier to drink at an inn, introducing Xu Jing and Liu Yinying to him. He told Bai Shier that these two were from Shanxi, and the one surnamed Xu was his sworn brother, who had fought several bloody battles against the insurgents under Zhou Yuji. After General Zhou died for his country, he came here to join the army. Tomorrow, he would be leading them to see General Wu, requesting to be employed. Bai Shier, knowing they were Zhang Cangqiu's friends, naturally nodded in agreement. He then told them about Sangui's acceptance of the imperial mandate, and said that now was a time when men of talent were needed, and that the two of them would surely be employed. Cangqiu also asked if General Wu had any anecdotes in the capital that could be used for conversation. Bai Shier then told him the scandalous story of Sangui visiting Tian Hongyu and obtaining Chen Yuanyuan, the number one beauty of Jiangnan, as a concubine, who was residing in Wu Xiang's mansion. Zhang Cangqiu, upon hearing this, laughed loudly and said, "General Wu, amidst his busy military life, actually has such leisure and elegance? This is truly no different from Hongfu eloping with Li Jing." Xu Jing smiled and said, "Since ancient times, famous generals have been romantic figures, and I suppose Commander Wu could not avoid this either." Liu Yinying, however, coldly said, "It is certainly not surprising that a general is fond of women, but one hopes that he can value national affairs as much as he values beauty, and do his best to be loyal and intelligent, and serve the country well." Xu Jing nodded and said, "Indeed." Bai Shier gave Liu Yinying a close look, and then said nothing, raising his glass to drink. Everyone drank heartily before dispersing. The next day, Zhang Cangqiu went to see Wu Sangui. He had already asked Ziying to sing his praises to Sangui, so when he mentioned Xu and Liu to Sangui, Sangui immediately agreed. He also told Zhang Cangqiu that he had been ordered to lead a large army into the pass to suppress the insurgents, and that anyone with a skill would be employed. He then instructed Zhang Cangqiu to bring the two men in to see him. Zhang Cangqiu then brought the two men to the yamen to pay their respects. (177)</p>
