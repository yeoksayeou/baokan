<p>路透社八日盤谷電　英外相艾登與國務卿赫爾同時所發反對日本侵泰之警吿、已在此商發生甚大印象、衆認赫爾言論固佳、然若欲切實銷除遠東戰爭陰靈、則尙需更詳明之言論、泰日局勢目前表面上尙形寗靜、但可慮之暗潮迄未銷滅、</p>

<h3>遠東利益嚴重威脅　英美對日無可再忍</h3>
<p>路透社八日倫敦電　今晨倫敦各大報對於日本均有嚴峻之批評、責日本具有兩副面目、並進行與　犯越南前相同之報紙宣傳運動、泰晤士報載稱、日本似已決定不願英美之警吿、而於佔領越南後繼以對泰國之有動、日本在西貢與康瀾灣之海　根據地及越南西兩部之空軍根據地、均爲　列濱·荷印·緬甸·馬來·及事實上南太平洋全部吳　地位之嚴重威脅、倘使日本竟被許在泰國獲得據點、則此種威脅將成爲不可容忍、目前姑不論泰政府之如何亟欲保持其　立、但對於日本所施之壓力、苟非絕對確定可依賴英美之立即援助、恐難加以抵抗、關於所傳香港人民現信除非警吿日本冉進即將引起戰爭、泰國不久即將步越南之後塵云云、鑒於英國重大利益之已處危境及日人一經前進即難用以遏止之事實、上項信念實無可疑、英國對此事之輿論、可於英外相艾登對此事之言論中見之、該報叉提及日本並不以在南對泰國施行威脅爲滿足、且更在滿洲調兵北進以威脅蘇聯、德國或願日本北攻、俾對現在向莫斯科翁進途中遭遇頓挫之德軍作有效之援助、但蘇聯在西伯利亞東部之軍隊、似較日本所能調往之軍隊爲優越、而蘇聯在海參崴之地位又具有重大關係、日本倘行進攻該地、則英國所遭之打擊將不下於其同盟國之蘇聯云、「每日電聞報」則稱、日本具有兩副面目、謂日本對於英外相艾登及美國務卿赫爾警吿對泰國行動之正式答覆、指爲係被誤會、並稱其意嚮純屬和平、而同時日方之廣播人員則奉命向其人民宣傳戰事或將隨時發生、日本各報亦逐日向英美實行其咆哮、在日本實行兩副面目之同時、其首相近衛會一再覲見日皇有所會商、該報又稱、泰國對於其本身所受之威脅、自不能毫無警惕泰國之人民自亦決無歡迎被日本利用之理由、總之東方各國恐無願日本爲其主人者、泰人如抵抗侵略、則將獲得立即之援助、因英美皆認日本之進犯泰國將威脅彼等之利益與安全也、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>秋汛中之防水問題</h3>
<p>雨季方過，而颶風之季節來臨，秋汛之高潮將至，此在都市生活中本不視爲重要；而無如今日之租界、時有水上行車，陸地泛舟，深涉淺揭，成爲大雨後習有之情景。夫積水爲患，年來始盛，今年已兩見之，雖備聞所以積水難消之說，而未程疏濬防水之功，則秋潦爲患，所予公衆以不便，又將不知至如何程度也。</p>
<p>原租界之所以積水，雖曰浦江失於官洩之故，遂致大雨之後，積水不能退，高潮猝至，溝管逆而上；此其咎責所在，不必言，亦不欲言，只看戰前何以無此現象，而後知失乳之兒爲可憫，雨暘燥濕，亦會乏人照管耳！然其阻塞之原因，尙不止此，蓋公共租界之溝管，東出浦，南北入吳淞江，而吳淞江兩側停留船隻，中僅一錢以通舟檝，水流多阻，易於積瀦，潮汐往返，水退砂留。溝管之口，遂易封塞，地面之水，失其宣洩，積水難消，此或其一，故濬浦仍須兼浚淞。至若法租界之汚水，向恃浦江陸家浜日暉港蒲肇河，以資排洩，而今日暉港以東通浦之路，盡成通衢，蒲肇日暉諸港淤塞特甚，大渠不利，小溝難宣。兩租界西區，向多曠野，河浜縱橫，原可稍補溝渠之不足，以瀦一部分地面之水，乃皆爲道路房屋建築工程所湮塞埋沒，橫截豎斷，積水更無歸納之所，西區遂多滯水爲患。又以都市發展之不同，舊時之道路，非放寬不能容龐大鉅重速率高强之車輛；即溝管，亦非改築放大，豈能容人口稠密，戶廛殷闐所排洩之汚濁。然而工程之改築不易，於是積水區域之廣泛深淺，幾與人口戶塵之增加而遞增。即當初建築道路，寗不知地形高低，水面上下，雨量多寡，市廛興隆，以之規畫路面基地之廣狹厚薄，溝管工程之敷設大小，舉是而經營之，應無積水之爲累；而今如何，不能謂非始謀不臧，所見狹陋，而有此失耳！</p>
<p>非不知處此環境之中，有益公衆之建設，無從談起，亦爲財力所不濟。但積水之妨礙公衆便利，於今爲最，不容置而不論。現在上海人士之生活，非同昔比，朝出晚歸，習以爲常；更以工商發達，市廛殷盛，房租昂貴，自熱鬧之區，退處於僻遠，交通便利，轉居於不便利，平時所賴以濟遠而仍得如時從公者，端賴公共交通工具；稍紓其困，以利其行耳！今則一有積水，公共交通車輛，即縮短路綫，至於停頓，未聞有顧念公衆便利而從速設法，使車輛早得復原也。道路之上，跬步皆水，沒脛而過；堂戶之內，濁水出入，不能安居；未聞有敏捷排水之工作，使水得早退也。至自溝管中冒逆而上者，臭穢不堪，毒菌滋生，侵入人體之內，爲病而至於死亡者有之，久病而爲終身之累者有之，此積水所危害公衆健康，妨礙起居福利，有如是深切利害之影響，安得不認爲社會最嚴重之一問題。且如本年雨季情形，上海雨量之巨，爲歷年冠，六月分十吋零八喱，七月分九吋二吩五喱，遠過於去年同期，足徵今年霉汛雨量之充霈，而以後雨量之爲如何、固難預卜。然昨（八日）爲立秋之第一日，適値颶風掠境，竟日風雨交加，低窪之處，又見第三决之積水。復聞長江上游，水位迭高，已及水準八十呎，突破三十年來紀錄。不憶民國二十年上游水位無今日之高，鄂皖沿江諸地，尙且盡遭水沒，難民蔽江而下，上海爲之設所收容，直至一二八戰事作，始全部疏散。今則上游之水，處建瓴之勢　傾瀉而下，鄂中堤防，恐難禦浩淼奔騰之勢，將盡成澤國；若加以漢水泛濫、則漢口有其魚之嘆，陸沉之虞。水流東下，蘇皖沿江卑隰之地，豈能獨全而倖免。在平時，上海猶以潮水爲患，茲如長江水大，下游雖廣，然爲泥沙沉澱之作用，大有的束洪流，不能流然滂然而朝宗於海，若倒灌入黃浦，再經朝潮夕汐所吸引，浮岸而上，久久不退，上海不亦有澤國棲止之可能。屆時而謀防水排水工作之進行，不亦爲晚？</p>
<p>秋霖不能無，風潮不能免，以上海人口之衆，商業之盛，負擔之鉅，凡一切所以防患於未然，而認爲市民應有之享受者，應預事準備。如道路積水之爲患有如此，而又時時見之，即使全部工程改良，一時不得實現，亦應隨時隨地，能盡其改善之實。此後遇有道路房屋之建築，應將其排洩各種設備，合於應有之標準。在一切未改善完全之前，則應迅籌排水工站之合理的設置，容或有一時積水之事，可於頃刻間排除使盡，無若今茲積水多日，猶未盡退。更當注意於公共交通車輛之行駛，不但不予人以不便，應在可能之範圍內，盡量予公衆以往返之便利，此固市政應有之義，本無所用其論列也。</p>
<h3>美英兩巨頭會晤　已成公開秘密　此舉性質重要不言而渝　美軍領袖均不在華盛頓</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統乘坐遊艇「波多馬克」號出遊之後、頃發表第一次公報並未涉及羅斯福總統將與英相邱口爾會晤之說僅謂總統藉無綫電收音機得悉國際動態云云、一般人雖知此遊艇現在新英格蘭各州海面、但究將駛往何處、官方仍守絨默、</p>
<p>路透社八日華盛頓電　就華盛頓人士而言、羅邱會議之傳說、現下不復被視爲神秘、要皆認此兩領袖有集議之可能、藍邱吉爾所可往者祇有兩處、非往莫斯科即來唔美總統也、據衆推測、邱吉爾如往蘇京、決不能毫無消息洩漏、故斷其必來晤羅斯福總統、一般人注意點不在此二領袖之是吾會晤、但在會晤之理由、若干政治觀察家以爲此决會議乃重要事件與步驟之先兆、且有人猜測霍甫金定已從莫斯科携回必須以全力援助蘇聯、庶可遏止德國前進之緊急消息、苟此二領袖果舉行會議、則事前並未從外交方面交換意見、亦未有任何佈置臨時集議、其重要可知、現有理由可信國務　並未知有此會議之佈置、故會議之內容、知之者僅美總統英相與霍甫金三人而已、此問人士並以爲美參謀長與海長諾克斯現果與總統同在一處、則邱吉雨未必前往、因美國國會難免不因英相與美國海陸部要人談話而起政治上反響也、惟據所知、參謀部馬歇爾與安諾德兩將軍皆出游於他處、距總統所在地頗遠、而海長諾克斯與海軍參謀長史泰克亦皆未赴總統所在處也、</p>
<h3>泰國願保持　門戶開放　對英日無分軒甚</h3>
<p>路透社八日盤谷電　泰國商務督辦巴那隆達爲出席東京調停會議泰代表之一、對新聞記者談話謂、泰國市塲不對任何國家予以封閉、而劉英允然、英國向來獲有保設、可得泰國物品之供給如其所需也、日木並未向泰國提出任何經濟要求、日方發言人昨日所稱、日泰經濟談判尙在進行中一節、殆指日本近向泰國銀行團借泰幣一千萬元事而言、泰國對與泰通商之各國、一律保持門戶開放、不欲對任何國予以特殊優待云、或問以日本要求泰國米錫橡膠專賣權之可能性、巴氏答稱、此殊未必、日本現已大批購進此類物品矣云、某報稱泰國拒絕日本請求不止十决、卒乃依允承認滿洲國云、又泰國財政部稱、泰國在外之資金現皆無恙、外傳已被凍結之說、實無根據、泰國資金大都存於英美云、</p>
<p>路透社八日盤谷電　官塲吾認日方所傳中英美三國因泰國承認滿洲國事、已向泰國抗議之說、並謂雌論如何、中國不能抗議、因中國與泰國間並未有外交關係也云、</p>
<h3>日決派專使赴越　促進親善關係</h3>

<h3>歐戰業談（七）（三）大西洋護航親歷記</h3>
<p>我們已到危險區域了。</p>
<p>我們行近愛爾蘭最北端杜尼加沿海的曼林海德，陽光照在碧綠的山上。我們的船只，依然連絡不斷的列成一錢，繼續向前進。過去陪伴我們的驅逐艦，紛紛擾擾，來回不停，但是我們知道每一艘驅逐艦都在按照計劃行動。潛艇的突襲，已被防止住了。海面頗爲平靜，幾片白雲，沒精打彩地懸掛在淡藍色的天空。我們和暴風雨苦鬥了幾天，現在已過到好天氣了。實則今日的天氣，似乎太好了一點。像這種平靜的天氣，潛艇不受到巨浪的衝擊，不致露出他們渾厚的鋼質艇身，因此不易被人發現。急降轟炸機也喜歡晴朗天氣。</p>
<p>左面兩英里處一艘驅逐艦，本來悠閒自若，却突然活躍了起來，鼓輪疾駛，衝向港口。從牠的四烟囱看來，可見是一艘美國的舊驅逐艦，大的在牠船尾三十碼處海面上，忽然飛起了一片大瀑布，五秒鐘後，發生爆炸，連我們的大貨船也震動得很利害。那艘驅逐艦發現了一艘潛水艇，投下一顆深射炸彈。另有一只美國舊驅逐艦趕來幫助。我們海岸空軍司令部的一架洛克希赫德遜飛機，護衛着我們，另有兩架，飛得不到五十呎高，正在驅逐艦上面指認潛艇正確的方位。</p>
<p>又有兩道噴泉直飛起來，陽光照在水沫上面，似在淸朗柔和空氣中跳舞。接着爆炸聲又作，我們的船又震動了。</p>
<p>驅逐艦如同小獵犬一般的東奔西馳，兩架赫德遜飛機高興地吼着。最後驅逐艦父恢復巡暹的工作，飛機也飛回來，重新在護航隊上空翱翔。一艘驅逐艦用信號燈打着信號。</p>
<p>大副跑下舵樓，吿訴我們說，那艘驅逐艦已擊中了一艘潛艇，海面上浮起一大片油，「阿司狄克」指向器也不能再尋出牠的地點了。</p>
<p>有幾艘船，已離開我們，駛向另港口。這旅程果然很長，但護航隊並不是循着直綫行駛，我們曾駛往極北，曲折而行，每隔幾小時就改變行駛的路綫一次。</p>
<p>我們自始至終都受着良好的護衛。漸漸地駛出了北大西洋德國剽襲艦巡邏的危險區域，最後還開入潛艇充斥的海面。我們所沉失船只，十分之九以上是在大西洋東部沉沒的。現在我們需要另一種保護了。我們需要快速的驅逐艦作護航隊之耳，以探素浴艇，毀滅潛艇。還需要飛機作護航隊之目，以與德國的俯衝轟炸機相搏鬥。我們穿過北海之峽，經過愛爾蘭海，知道岸上的戰鬥　塲，正在等候我們遭受德機　擊的信號。從我們看見陸地以後，噴火機和旋風機與我們間的距離，便會已不超過十五分鐘時間。海軍和空軍兩部保護我們，却聯絡得非常之好。</p>
<p>我乘着貨船，自加拿大出發，橫渡大西洋，現已泊在英國港口，在大餐問中寫成這篇報吿。我知道我們這一起離開加拿大的船，共在五十艘以上，到今天傍晚，每一艘都已到達了英國的海港。</p>
<p>水雷當然常足以危及護航隊。水雷可分爲三種：一是上决歐戰中所用的普通浮動水雷，一是下碇的磁性水雷，一是繫留的接觸水雷。德國的水雷是下碇的，因爲浮動水雷隨風飄流，也足以危及德國的潛水艇。水雷的錨鏈，少有長過四十寸或於百四十英尺的，所以護航隊若知道船底下的水在四十寸以上，對於水雷便無所用其憂慮了。然而有時却不這樣</p>
<p>四天以前，我正和總機師同立在甲板上。忽聽得兩下尖銳刺耳的鐘聲。瞭望台上的瞭望員，已發見什麽東四了。</p>
<p>此時波濤洶湧，我向右舷觀看，　　所見。再向後望看見砲手們已擁在砲後。我向總機師借用望遠鏡—讀者須知祇有影戲中的軍事訪員是隨身帶着望遠鏡的—但仍看不見什麽。一艘驅遂艦—這又是美國舊驅逐之一艦旋風也似的轉將過來，隔在我們的貨船和右舷的船只中間。這時我已看見六十碼外有一個黑色東西，好像大浮標一樣。實則並不是浮標，乃是一個水雷。</p>
<p>從驅逐艦的舵樓上發出閃閃的燈光。共時船只祇用旂話通信，現在却用信號燈發出點綫作符號，互相談話，奇怪的是在日光之下，遠處不可望見。我們後面的船只，不得不遠離驅逐艦和這孤單的水雷。驅逐艦在波濤滾滾之中上下翻騰，距離水雷的有二百碼之遙。</p>
<p>當各船經過後，祇聽得一陣機關槍聲，以後便寂無所聞</p>
<p>一個大砲彈可以炸毀水雷。驅逐艦對於飄零的水雷不願浪費砲彈，所以改用機關槍，子彈擊穿水雷的外殼，海水侵入，便沉到海底去了。</p>
<p>我們很運氣，到英國沿岸的那夜很是黑暗。我們通過了離愛爾蘭僅一英里的禁區賴斯令島，這隊疲乏的船只，便很慶幸地經過了海峽。</p>
<p>我們很是小心，因爲這雖是英國領海，却遍布着英德兩國的水雷。我們即使撩着一個小水雷，也是不了得因爲船上有的是炸藥啊！</p>
<p>在右面遠處，突有探海燈光一道，射入黑暗的天空。我們正在貝爾法斯特附近，恰好遇到空襲。黑夜中平靜的空氣，帶來了德機微弱的嗡嗡聲。因爲距離得遠，重濁的砲聲幾乎聽不出。飛機的馬達聲音增大了，他們已越來越近了，但是夜色掩蔽着我們，他們竟會在不知不覺之中，把這一批戰利品交臂失去了。</p>
<p>海洋好比一座森林，可是埋在海面下的水雷，和隱伏着的潛艇却比毒蛇猛獸還要可怕得多哩。（完）</p>

<h3>美出版界權威盧斯夫歸　重慶山城訪問記（五）</h3>
<p>上午五點十分，我們到達一黃色小山的斜坡下，步出汽車，把汽車用油布蓋好。（此地鄕村一帶全是黃土—如粉末狀的塵土，可稱世界上最古售的泥土），空氣是淸潔和凉爽。一家農舍的打穀塲上，全家的人都在工作。我們在小徑上繞着農家走一圈，看見有一片比打穀塲較大的操塲。一隊兵排成隊伍，他們立正，軍樂洋洋，軍官都在行禮—但並非向他們總司令行禮。他們正對前面遠遠的山巔上，一面在晨曦中飄展的中華民國共和國國旗行最敬禮！軍隊隨即以跑步向前行進。這天淸早所見就是此地的大部份軍隊。在這小村司令部統轄下的一萬二千人，都散伏在黃河北面六哩之地。</p>
<p>等國旗升起，士兵散開後，他帶我們到一間泥屋的接待室中。其一張大桌子上放着茶和餅乾，招待非常殷勤。在此小室中周將軍發了幾條命令，有一二軍官進出，行動迅速，紀律嚴明。周將軍拿出幾張很淸晰的地圖，但都畫在劣質紙上。這幾幅地圖全部表示給我們看，他一都份隊伍在中國廣大戰錢上所佔據的地位。</p>
<p>茶點之後，將軍說我們可到農村周圍去看看。是一處很動人的地方。每隔一段短距離，在黃土的削壁間有深的山谷，每一山谷就可駐屯一隊兵。我們曾詳細視察一山谷兵營。谷中的地是由塵土舖成，但一點沒有塵埃的影跡。那裏有一方地可以種菜，地上是揷了不知什麼東西，有幾個兵正在園中工作。沿街都種植樹木。將軍把我們由斜披一直引到厠所。他非常自負；使你不能看見他們；這就是一種戰略；把每一件東西用石灰或泥土遮掩。我們跑進山洞中，每洞可以睡兵士十五人，洞中有一張桌子，一個書箱，其中的有書籍一百本。在洞前有五十兵士圍着一圈，靜聽政治科學的演講。他還引我們去看村中一排泥屋，這是兵士新爲農人蓋的。他說：「我們給農人蓋屋子，但他們必需要維持整潔」。在那天朝晨當然是很淸潔的！說是中國最淸潔的東西。</p>
<p>在村的一端，有一小隊騎兵集合。我們一羣人騎上蒙古戰馬—馬匹之小，爲我所僅見。我們成單行跑過村莊，將軍一馬當先，但正要出發時，我妻子的一匹馬忽然打別扭跑到田中，使她遺失鏡箱一具。我們向潼關之路出發，這是在黃河邊上的一個有城墻的市鎭。六七哩路程中混着不少交通工具—有驢子，也有獨輪車—都是運輸各軍用的軍需品。我們跑進二三大村莊，村中人民很多，食物店中把食物堆得很高。在此地村間的山谷中大都有蔬菜園。</p>
<p>我們立刻望見了黃河，直到潼關城墻之內，才不再看見。城墻兩端都有山嶺，與寓里長城一樣。我們在城門口下馬，顯然地很使周將軍的部下奇怪的，他引了我們走錯綜小巷，以至鐵路堤防。我們於是望到河對面在日軍一方面的高山。此地離日軍大砲的有二千公呎，我們可以看見堤防上一堆一堆的碎石，但車輛仍由隧道中往來，直通潼關。</p>
<p>周將軍引我們穿過城市，城中張貼觸目皆是。數畝地本來是有泥房的，現已傾圮。後來我們走到近黃河一面和日軍一面的城墻。在城墻裏面，駐紥前錢的團長和我們遇見，並領我們到他的司令部去。他在亂瓦堆中建立一個花圃。團長把我們引入一防空洞，在一張餐桌上請我們吃茶。桌上和旁邊的桌子上都供着鮮花。於是我們從城內部登城墻，我們走到頂上，周將軍耍我們把頭不伸出在雉堞外面，以防日軍望見。在河與城墻之間大的有八百碼路，要渡河至少有一千碼長的路。我們可以望見第十六軍蜿蜒不絕的壕塹，和機關槍隊的所在地。</p>
<p>我們走出廣大的城門口，立刻即踏到壕溝中。我們走得略遠一點，遇見二個機關槍隊。兵士都在看書。我們停着一看書本的內容，大抵是一種初級讀本，開首就解釋每一個好的兵士都應當讀書。最後，我們已走近前哨，數碼路之前就是滔滔不絕的黃河，在此地成一大弧形，即著名的河套是也</p>
<p>就是這許多。黃河滾滾不息，這天倒是很平靜的。我們經過潼關歸去，在城外近郊我們的一輛汽車奇蹟地等待在那裹再跑了不少哩數路去看村中一大砲砲位。砲手每日做着例行公事，看去非常生氣勃勃。</p>
<p>周將軍在此地和另一副官騎馬跑在我們後面，我們駕車先行。在鄕間的路上，他們可以趕上汽車，利我們並行。我們讓馬匹先行以免汽車後面揚起的塵埃。在兩片麥田間有一條小徑與公路分歧。將軍向我們作最後的道別，撥馬向小徑而去—回到司令部去。我們最後望着這位短小精悍的周將軍坐在一匹蒙古戰馬上，他正向前行進，爲着中國的勝利（完）</p>

<h3>糧食部確定計劃　解決民食問題　實行生產消費及儲存計劃　發行糧食庫券放佃農</h3>
<p>重慶　中國作戰已入第五年、中國所有之米或不足以供戰時之需要、至少亦極難將所有之米流通、若干交通命脈、尸爲日軍所截斷、爲應付此問題、中國政府特首决設立一糧食部、使其處理此中國最重要之問題、該部所欲解決之問題極爲複雜、計有下列各項、（一）關於生產消費或貯存、並無可靠之統計、（二）戰前中國之</p>
<p>糧食輸入　已被截斷、（三）揚子江一帶至宜昌爲止、由日本控制、各省間之供求不能相互調劑、（四）貨幣之低落、及米糧之比較缺乏、已使米成爲囤積及投機之對象、尤其以收受穀米爲田租之佃中爲甚、（五）政府須採購巨量之米、以供養龐大軍隊、並發給米貼與政府雇員、及低級官員、以補充共戰時微薄之俸給、在一力三八及一九三九兩年、</p>
<p>五榖豐收　故此問題尙不急待處理、但去年則收成不佳、今年之希望亦僅平常、故此問題巳漸顯嚴重、主要之注意現時係集中於肥沃之四川、該省爲中國未淪陷區戰時經濟之核心、因此政府選任徐堪爲糧食部長、徐氏爲叫川人、任財政部决長業已多年、徐氏接見合衆社記者時、曾概述糧食部處理此項問題之計劃、渠稱下列各項、將</p>
<p>加以實行　、（一）糧食部將設法、便利產有多餘糧食之區域之運輸、（二）將設法處置囤積及投機者、並禁止虛糜五穀、如用以釀酒等、（三）政府將敎導民衆利用米以外之其他粉食、如小麥大麥甘薯及豆類等、（四）政府將設法購致所有餘糧、（大概即指耕種者自己食用及留種子以外所餘之穀）、關於此點、糧食部計劃鼓勵在全國各地、建造公共及</p>
<p>政府倉庫　、以儲存餘糧、俾得供養軍隊、及政府文職雇員、且遇有仟何地方糧食市價有劇漲之趨向時、政府又可發售平糶、以統制價格、當局估計本年實行以穀米繳納地稅後、單就四川一省論、已可收得穀米六百萬石（六萬六千萬磅）、糧食債券亦可在本省一省獲得同一數量、此項債券、將於一九四三年開始、分五年</p>
<p>平均贖回　、並將用微收地稅所得之穀米付給、徐部長坦然承認、渠將迺遇困難、允共是關於獲取佃主及商人所持有之餘糧、彼等一向不欲依政府所定之價格、將餘糧售與政府、因政府所定之價格、當較市塲之高漲價格爲低也、但政府最近所頒布之兩項新辦法、或可大爲克服、此種困難、其一即爲以穀米定納地稅、其二即爲發行</p>
<p>糧食債券　、由政府向穀主借穀、發給債券、許於兩年　連同利息、用穀米償還、徐部長力言政府根據孫總理之中國農業計劃、已定有遠大計劃、其第一點、即爲解放佃農、徐氏指出中國雖無若帝俄時代擁有極大財產之大佃主、但仍有極　「中產佃主、收取佃戶所產之大部份以爲田租、例如在成都一帶、佃戶須將其收成之百分之七十三</p>
<p>納與佃主　、徐氏又稱、自戰事開始以後、佃主之收入增加十倍至二十倍、結果米之價格亦增高、因此佃戶所獲不足以糊口、此乃對於中國農村經濟、及生產最惡劣之影響、國民黨之基本政綱、應爲耕者有共田、但此種理想、應逐步實現、政府之第二部計劃、爲採用近代科學耕種方法、以增加農產、　三點則爲統制餘糧、</p>
<p>統制分配　、節省消費、並改善運輸、此項偉大之計劃、現時方開始具體實施、糧食債券之命令公布時、重慶國民公報發表評論、謂國民政府之威望即繫於第一决發行糧食債券之成功、該報稱、「辦理此事者若有何舞弊、則全部計劃必致失敗、如此項計劃實施得宜、則可抑平糧價、使民食充沛、結果可重新穩定貨幣」云、（八日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>直接稅　稅收激增</h3>
<p>重慶　財政部直接稅司長高秉坊談、中國直接稅在作戰中成長、現已步入正軌、本年度利得稅截至目下止、已超過所得稅三分之一、到年底或可望增至一倍云、據川康直接稅處息、本年度川康區所得稅預算爲六千五百萬元、上半年實際收入爲三千餘萬元（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>怎樣研究植物學（一）</h3>
<p>— 袁善徵</p>
<p>植物學是什麼</p>
<p>物合稱生物、和動物礦物三者合稱博物、吾人以植物爲對象、用科學的方法、硏究牠的形態·生理·生態和人類的關係等的學問、叫做植物學、因植物界的現象非常複雜、爲研究便利起見、分做純粹植物學和應用植物學、純粹植物學又分做植物形態學（包括外部形態學·解剖學·細胞學等）植物分類學·植物生理學·植物生態學·植物分布學·古植物學等、應用植物學叉分農業植物學·工業植物學·森林學·藥用植物學等、</p>
<p>（二）爲什麼硏究植物學一、世界上所有的食物、都是從綠色植物製造出來的、食物是造成生物的軀體和供給能力以資工作的物質、世界上假使沒有綠色植物、一切的動物便不能生存、而人類也就無法維持生活了、我們有時聽到某地風災、某處水災、某處旱災、都爲之憂慮萬分、到了現在、因爲奸商囤米、使我們的生活受到極端的困難、這不是植物對於人類的生命有密切的關係麼、</p>
<p>二、衣服的原料、除綢緞毛織品是從動物造成的以外、可是普通的衣料都是從植物（棉麻）的織維造成的、沒有衣料、就不能保護身體、</p>
<p>三、築建房屋的原料、除高大的洋房外、普通的房屋、都是從植物造成的、至於室內的用具、以及貼壁地板等、無一不用植物造成的、</p>
<p>四、交通方面舟車及鐵路上的枕木、都耍用植物造成的、</p>
<p>五、治療疾病的藥物、在國醫方面、的有十分之七八是植物、而西藥中的金鷄納霜和當歸素麻黃素等、也是從植物中提取出來的、現在東西各國都有人硏究我國的藥物、每年輸到外國的數量很大、如此情形、植物在醫藥上的價値、可想而知了、六、庭前花壇、種植花卉、以供觀賞、荒山曠野、點綴風景的、也以植物爲主、</p>
<p>七、細菌是一種極小的植物、對於人類有利亦有害、宜硏究消滅及利用之法、增進人類的輻利、</p>
<p>八、我國以農立國、而農夫無科學知識、墨守成法、不知改良、致產量不豐、非常可惜、欲求改良、以謀人類的幸福、不得不研究植物學、</p>
<p>九、工業的原料、取之於植物的很多、我們要想振興工業、必先充足有利於工業的植物、</p>
<p>十、研究各種植物、比較異向、分門別類、有條不紊、誠爲訓練人類知道運用科學方法的良好材料、</p>

<h3>昨日猛烈颶風襲滬　全市在暴風雨中　潮水倒灌馬路悉成澤國　航運中斷車輛局部停頓</h3>
<p>昨日在風暴雨隨農歷之立秋以俱來、全市又再陷入紊亂反常之狀態、蓋據徐家匯天文台報吿、起源於太平洋赤道區域之颶風、以每小時十英哩之速率、於昨晚至今晨間由離此的一百二十海哩之大戢山洋面、抄上海之東部以北進、昨日整日之疾風暴雨、乃因此颶風風翼經過、帶來低氣壓之故、益以昨日適逢望日高潮、工水倒灌、公共東輛、因路面積水、紛紛停頓進廠、而航運方面、以海關警吿、亦暫行中斷、幸風力中心未經上海、吾則爲害之烈、當允甚於此也、</p>
<p>颶風進襲海關警吿</p>
<p>江海關於昨晨六時、接天文台報告、謂颶風已侵至北緯二十九度、東經一百二十四度、風向西北進、本市時受襲擊、海關得報、旋於七時牛、在鐘樓屋頂高懸黑十字信號、警吿浦江船隻預防、中午又接天文台報吿、颶風已進抵北緯三十度東經一百二十三度、風頭已抵本市、至下午二時、海關復接報吿、颶風進至北緯三十度〇〇、東經一百二十二度五〇、</p>
<p>昨晚十一時、本報向徐家匯天文台探詢、知颶風盤旋之位置、在北緯三十一度、及東經一百二十二度三十分之間、速度的十一·二英里間、察共位置、颶風已掠滬而過、</p>
<p>航運停頓交通阻梗</p>
<p>昨晨海關懸信號警吿時、浦江東西兩岸、交通斷絕、渡輪完全停駛、惟公司自備小輪、尙冒險行駛、所有駁船划子、均開往蘇州河暫避、昨日進口船隻、上午十時半前有十一艘到埠、除華綸洋開利號由派倫排（譯音）（荷屬）運煤斤之大船外、其餘均係行駛長江下游小輪、出口全日無船、預定出口之荷輪芝巴德號、太古公司漢陽輪、中止啓椗、待颶風過境、即行起程、昨日應到滬之太古公司北洋班新北京輸、亦因颶風未到、</p>
<p>高潮豪雨積水成渠</p>
<p>昨日中午、風勢愈吹愈緊、暴雨驟作、又値月望高潮、浦江潮水漲時、形似萬馬奔騰、江水滔滔、側灌路面、整日不退、低窪之處、悉成澤國、公共租界浙江路·四川路·九江路·漢口路·福州路·靜安寺·愚園路·大西路·地豐路·憶定盤路等處、均水深過膝、法租界霞飛路中段、馬浪路·薩坡賽路·蒲石路·聖母院路·貝勒路一帶、亦積水盈尺、路人跣足露腿、涉水以渡、情形極形狼狠、而人力車夫猶叫囂不絕、索價高昂、有至六七元者、他如汽車等因機器沒水、街頭拋錨、前後相接、情形異常紊亂、按本埠時常大水爲患、不但有礙衛生、抑且阻滯交通、一般市民、怨聲載道、兩租界當局、雖有意於塡高路面或改良溝渠、但因工程浩大、非短期間內所能竣事、</p>
<h3>兩租界於昨晚起　開始特別戒備　警員在戒備期禁止請假　非必要馬路將一律阻斷</h3>

<h3>租界區域外匯供給　財部將頒辦法　此後外滙買賣集中四行　未經特准不得經營買賣</h3>
<p>美國政府發給中中交農四行特種照會、維護中國對外正當貿易後、新聲社記者昨向四行曁各華商銀行探悉、財政部對上海租界區域、進口商人經營必需品輸入、需要購買外匯、以及維護合法貿易等辦法、正在擬訂具體辦法中、開此後外滙之買賣、將集中於四行、華商商業銀行未經特准、不得冉行經營外匯隨業務、關於上海黑市匯率、飭外匯平準基金委員會設法繼續維持、並飭國民勵行節的、所有奢侈品及非必需品、應節省浪費、以供建國之用、</p>
<p>中交兩行臨時辦法</p>
<p>中國交通兩銀行、對自由區域進口商經營之進口貨而爲國內必需者、均依法供給法價外滙、至於上海租界區域因情形特殊、凡必需品之輸入、經中國政府特准者、依法供給外匯、並決定在未奉財政部命令以前、輸入上海之貨物、雖爲必需品、如禾經政府特准、暫停供給外匯、但進口商如有外匯存在該兩行者不在此限、聞非必需品而爲政府禁止進口之　百三十四稅則號貨物、絕對不得向中交請求外匯、</p>
<p>華商銀行遵令辦理</p>
<p>中央銀行依照閂政府發給之六十號照會規定對華商經營外匯之商業銀行、凡在七月二十六日以前買進賣出之外匯、統由該行代爲收付後、即華商商業銀行已被美政府凍結之資金、得由中央銀行代爲轉賬、變爲未凍結之資金、並限八月十五日以前完全軋淸、此後各華商銀行之外匯業務、決遵照財政部命令辦理、在未奉部令以前、外匯業務、除在上海本埠有外匯頭寸者外、不得已暫行停止、</p>
<p>友邦銀行續予供給</p>
<p>財政部以前頒佈之禁止進口貨品辦法、以及出口貨領取外匯差額辦法、自由區域各海關均已奉令邀辦、惟上海江海關因環境關係、從未照辦、奢侈品及非必需品、仍得輸入上海、聞是項應禁之貨、雖不得向中交兩行申請外匯、但至目前爲止、仍得向匯豐等十四家友邦銀行購買、因各友邦銀行實施凍結、並不澈底、於是投機商操縱外匯迄未絕跡、外匯黑市之買賣、依然自由、所謂嚴格審核、徒有其名、</p>
<p>黑市外匯繼續維持</p>
<p>外匯平準基金委員會、自派美籍委員福克斯來滬考察後、已根據考察所得決定辦法、按步實施、關於上海黑市外匯、決依照中國政府旣定政策予以繼續維持、以維中國及友邦商正當貿易、維持辦法、亦已與花旗·匯豐·等友邦銀行商妥、新聲社記者昨向外匯市塲探悉、昨日黑市趨緊、實因投機商乘風作浪所致、聞平準會除竭力維持外、並設法防止此不正當之波動、以安匯市而維正當貿易、</p>
<h3>風雨載途蒞館面談　寄予無限同情　具見申請助學之殷切光明亦必從奮鬬中來</h3>
<p>整大的在風暴雨。震動了我們的心弦，深刻了我們的歉意，鼓勵了我們服務的精神！</p>
<p>爲了辦理申請助學金者的調査，同人曾在近白度的陽光下，痛快的流汗而執行我們的義務，昨天倖免了陽光的逼射，恰又遇到颶風過境，風風雨雨，好像是要我們認識人生旅途的必須奮鬭，同時我們除了親往訪問調査而外，爲了有一部分申請助學金者的住址，對於我們訪問上比較困難，故去信通知請其來館面談，昨天突然的颶風來臨，可是我們的通知信，已經早三天發出去了，我們擔憂着身體較弱的學生們在途中受這暴風雨的襲擊，我們抱歉地已經無法作改期的通知，直到他們來館談完了話歸去以後，我們這個歉意，無法磨滅，我們懸懸的心靈，未能安定，如果今日天氣還是這樣，凡是已經的定的遠道的申請助學金的學生們，我們可以而且應該變通順延一天，我們一方面果然希望各同學能够鍛鍊刻苦的精神，但我們對於特殊的交通阻礙，認爲是應該展延的，希望接通知信被的談話的同學注意。</p>
<p>風雨如晦，鷄鳴不已；旣見學子，云胡不喜。</p>
<p>昨天我們的定談話的幾位同學，冒着在風掌不住雨傘，而叉滿街大水的難難行程，多數是步行來館，所以我們要把這首古詩，改爲『旣見學子，云胡不喜。』我們確信道種精神，就是你們將來立身處世，奮鬭成功的因素，我們忻喜而歉仄交織成功的心緒，在送別你們的時候，把這股祝你們歸途良好的熱情，交託你們帶回，永遠的保存。</p>
<p>同人昨天也曾冒着風雨出去調査，這是同人應盡之資，我們不想說我們昨天的調查經過，到是覺得昨天來館的同學，應予紀述之點很多，同情，期望，安慰，我們這樣的縈繞着腦際。</p>
<p>一位十三歲的學生，戰後奪了他父親的生命，他母子倆在一個小茶樓租了一隻舖位，靠母親結手套以維持生活，一天吃兩頓粥，四個大餅，餓着而又吃不起飯，每期借學費，準備拔還，而終是無力。</p>
<p>兩位請求助學的兄妹，他的父親在初中敎課，負擔一家十口的生活，和敎育費，所有收入連買米還不够，但又確信子女不受敎育，將來更無以爲生。一位二十歲的大學生，父親去世而賴其姊服務所人維持家庭生計，他是優續生，在殷切期望着得以繼續學業。他鄭重地說，他距離服務社會的時間，漸漸迫近，社會人士的助學精神，是永不敢忘的。</p>
<p>兩位學習產科的小姐，一位是七歲喪父，繼又喪母，弟妹亦均夭亡，眞是孤苦伶仃，孑然一身，她忍住熱淚，逐漸低落他的語音，但她不頽喪，不畏縮的精神，是可以觀察得出的。一位是戰後父親避至宜昌，全家失散，杳無音訊，她戰前就在上海求學，現在由她的同學，供她住宿，她期待着學業的成就，同時企求得着父親的下落，是同樣的熱切。</p>
<p>爲了助學金的調查，使各位弟妹們重新憶起你們艱苦經歴的人生旅程，可是這不應該引起你們消極的創痕，而應該是你們積極的激勵，艱苦永遠是幫助成功者的，凡是墮落的人，決不是從艱苦中來，同時也決不認識艱苦的，這是同人所欲勉勵和安慰各位的。（N）</p>
<h3>高潮與豪雨　常使上海泛濫　路面逐年陷落影響亦鉅根本補救約須二萬萬元　工部局工務處長在扶輪會之講演</h3>
<p>工部局工務處長吉姆森、前日在都城飯店扶輪會週會席上演說稱、上海街衢、常易泛濫、有兩大原因、即每月兩次之高潮與豪雨是、高潮時降大雨、水位漲齊馬路、則各街衢即易積水、</p>
<p>上海街衢逐年低陷</p>
<p>另一種原因陷落三分之一吋以至一吋不等、而西區低陷程度、允較中區爲甚、路面陷落、係用特殊器具估量之、此外、更可測量潮之漲落、以定低陷之程度、以華懋公寓言、自該厦於若干年前落成起、其四週之馬路、已低陷五呎左右、</p>
<p>蘇河失濬積水難瀉</p>
<p>爲欲補救泛濫情勢、的須二萬萬元、以購置必要之設備與機器、然目下未能提出此項計劃、因兩租界行政機關無力籌此巨款也、每逢豪雨如注、街頭積水，退落迂緩、乃因蘇州河水漲之故、更有一種泛濫之原因、爲過去四載來蘇州河迄未疏洩、致使積水之瀉退、大受阻緩、</p>
<p>颶風過滬輒成泛濫</p>
<p>一九三五年颶風過滬時、街頭泛濫、有深及五呎者、時或潮漲、外灘與河南路區四週水高三呎、故此區馬路有翻造之必要、並將陰溝之一道遮斷、祇許積水瀉出、而不得流入、普通幫浦法作屋宇洩水之用、已證明頗有效用、</p>
<p>繁盛區域尤難補救</p>
<p>但南京路上百貨大公司四週之馬路、頗成困難問題、該處交通異常擁擠、且電車綫縱橫、致不能將路面墊高、而陰溝亦不能加以遮斷、以其與他部份相連接、使兩水流入陰溝也、西區積水最深、乃因往年該區當局不許工務處前往工作所致、但在二十六年滬戰後、工務處已派隊墊高該區馬路、</p>

<h3>申請助學者　實地該問記（三）</h3>
<p>小販木匠和銅匠</p>
<p>陽光普照的下午，開始我的調查工作，每天這樣的，按着許多請助學生的住址，一個一個的去找起來，經過了五天，所得的結論，大致都是社會上一般的貧困情形，由此也可以見得富人固然不少，窮人更多，所望於富人的，相幫我們、來助助窮人吧！</p>
<p>我所發現的窮人，包括着難民·銅匠·木匠·小販等等，而這一般窮人的子弟，他們都能用功讀書，成績優良，品行很好，這是一件可歌而又可泣的事情。有一個姓張的，他是瀏河人，老家燬於砲火，父親起初賣水菓，現在已經失業，母親作女工，住在廣西路慈德里某號，在鄰居的房後搭舖一張，這個一榻之地，眞是暗無天日，所幸他的鄰居很可憐他們，不時助他一餐，這種情景，眞叫人爲之辛酸！</p>
<p>還有的，一個是銅匠的兒子，姓周；一個是木匠的兒子，姓張；這兩個學生，相差兩歲，可是同學，同班，同住在北海路一間水木作裏面，他們的成績倒還不錯，操行確都是甲等。銅匠的兒子說：他的父親每天肩担出去，有時作得生活，有時就空手而回；母親是作臨時女工；一家三人的生活，就是靠這樣來維持。說話的時候，不斷的發出了他的哀鳴。木匠住的是擱樓，他有七十一歲的老父，和十六歲的兒子，也都擠在這擱樓裹，據木匠的兒子說：「他生在上海，出生四個月，娘就死了。他的父親做了十六年的鰥夫，侍奉老父，撫養兒子，他因爲有咳嗽病，身體不好，所以輟過兩年學」。照他所說的看來，這位木匠，倒是一個孝子義夫呢！（D）</p>
<p>苦學的靑年</p>
<p>楊觀復今年是十九歲，剛從初中畢業，下半年擬入無錫國學專修館，考期還沒有到。他的父親是女裝裁縫，他的哥哥在九龍，也是學裁縫的，而他自己發奮要讀書。十五歲喪母，父親續娶，又生一弟，尙有祖母，現在一家五口，居於一間狹隘黑暗的後客堂裏。繼母的慈愛富然遠不及親生母親。生活是那樣的窮苦，而他的讀書却是非常用功。因爲成績良好，學校方面特准免費，他在申請表上略歴項下塡着。，「生長於滬郊農村，十二歲來滬，向在存德小學攻讀。十五歲喪賢母，家道中落，漸呈蕭條，至於中學求學，由校中特准免費。」</p>
<p>當我去訪他的時候，他沒有在家，家裏人也都不在，據二房東說：「他在學校裏，要到晚間方能回來，家裏人都回鄕下去了，他們眞苦得很呢！」我便留條的他到報館裏來面談。我回到報館，忽接得他先一日所發的來信，說：「晚因家境寒微，際此生活費用高漲，而家嚴以菲薄薪水，每感入不敷出，何來餘資供晚求學？是故向貴報館申請助學金。然適値家嚴歇夏（紅幫裁縫向有歇夏歇寒之例），已於上月返鄕小住，以爲减少一部分費用，僅留晚獨居滬上，晚因個八膳食等極感不便，亦思回鄕，然則倘貴館派員來舍調査，勢必失迓，是以來函，願貴執事能吾預以調査日期相吿，俾便迎迓，誠爲二得，未知尊意如何？……」文字簡潔老練，而內心苦痛，溢於言表。觀其成績，十三項科目，獲甲等者十，殊屬難得。</p>
<p>他準時來館，是一個斯文沉靜的靑年，體質似乎不佳，成續單上體育分數最劣，列入丙等。這　是用功過度所致。應該加以注意的。據他說，在初中時，非特免費，而且免費在校膳食，上課之餘，兼爲校中管理圖書室，故得享受免膳的待遇。暑期後擬考無錫國學專修館，因爲他對文科特別有興趣，所以想繼續專門研究國學。考期還沒有到，我只得預祝他將來榜上有名，及早通知本館，以憑核辦。</p>
<p>年靑好學，刻苦耐勞，眞是令人感佩！可是他的身體似乎不夠强壯，這該是營養不足，辛勞過度所致吧！（T）</p>

<h3>氣煞法幣妬煞銀　金價竟見九百元</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗市、漲風愈演愈烈、在混亂狀况下、價已飛出七千元大關外、各方人心一致向上、全因外（滙在日銀行及投機扒進一百六七十萬美元驚人扒風中、破入五元關內、英金緊至三辦十內、更出現空前貴價、故塲內滬西幫之一再拋售、義元義豐及大豐新豐永之爭出、但金號幫成記證券幫德孚（後亦復出）益大熾大一利與銀號幫恒記天元買風中、散多有抬無撳、致價仍由六千八白四十八元步盤升至七千一百元、終再軋升二百三十元、全日交易十五六萬兩、現金上午祥興永進成記一百兩、價八千六百元、萬豐出順源五十兩爲八千五百九十元、十點半後期交飛漲、故無價喊出、下午合盛出德成五十兩、價已升至八千八百元空前高價、再軋升二百三十元、致飾金亦升二十五元、見九百元高價、</p>
<p>烚赤出七千元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市、爲六千八百七十元、比上日收價高三十五元、决梢回下、至六千八百六十元、成記益大來力進、哄至六千八百八十元、及聞美滙帶硬、新豐永大豐義豐爭出、曾步降三十二元、遜至六千八百四十八元、爲德孚益大成記力進、盤於六千八百六十元左右極久、直至十點半後、外滙緊風轉烈、聞銀行少供意、人心大振、義豐大豐及散戶亦來傾進、步飛上五十元、突出六千九百元外、達六千九百十五元、時義元新豐永鼎盛售進至六千八百八十五元、不久美金破人五元關內、新豐永復進、誠達恒記成記德孚再來力進、售者束手、價竟再飛上一百三十五元、突出七千元外、達七千〇二十朮、時益大復出、滬西幫再售退至六千九百九十元、俄叉上升、午收七千元、收後再升至七千零三十元、下千在買風中有照開價高五元及十元買進者、二點開市爲七千零四十元、比午收價高四十元、俄又哄至七千零五十元、同康永恒記益大來力售小至七千零　十元、奈外　有緊難回、不久買風再熾、鼎盛熾大公大新豐、永一利成記傾進、益大復進爲數允巨、致兩度飛上達七千一百元、經義豐德孚力售、曾回退至七千零四十元、終在抬風中三點半收市、七千零六十五元、比上日再在漲二百三十元、查已連升四天之久、共漲三百八十四元、照八月美金四元八一二五結價、爲七千二百三十六元、計撳一百七十一元、收後益大天元誠達進抬至七千一百元、新豐永售掛、最後七千零九十二三元、當日高低二百五十二元、現金號之本牌金門市售價八千八百五十元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>紗花　隨滙市而起動盪　舷梯市塲興奮有加　空戶急於抵補…期現一致狂跳</h3>
<p>迴旋兩日之紗市、今則又復回升、且午後漲風奇熾、此因標金猛騰、外匯改縮、以致人心激昂、致爲提起、但同業大戶心思、皆屬平庸、因爲廠方口齒鬆懈、皆有開售之意、惟證券幫及金子幫一律拖進、所以上午之局勢、依然在擯持之中、不過港幫需要殷切、對於三二支單紗、購辦殷切、價格續升至四十元之譜、進外棧雙馬三百八十包、二三支金鷄大發三百六十五包、九日並有棉紗十六件運烟台、就實際情形亦屬良好、二十支雙馬高價一千五百九十二元、低價爲一千五百六十七元、午後市况在跳、因標金飛漲、英美匯一致在縮、同時取引所大跳、浮空又爲惶恐、急於扒補、初做一千五百九十五元、一霎間漲出六百元關外、爲一千六百〇五元、至十兀·十八元·二十元、中途盈利者吐出、回下至一千六百〇五元、以後爲消息佳良、又復漲至一千六百二十元、最後價爲一千六百十九元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市况、十分平疲、首盤價為一千五百七十二元、因某豐某號傳、言代廠方賣出幾百包、於是人心渙散、惟標金已見漲風、然檯面上之情態、極形冷淡、常在一千五百七十兀至六十八之間、往返甚久、至於客幫交易、依然不弱、然人氣難以抬起、豈料十二時左右、聞標金市價爲七千元、空頭扒補、漲至一千五百九十二元收盤、査牛日間成交統計七千八百九十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　八九〇同行七、〇〇〇統計七、八九〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况由平定而猛升、波動劇烈、當晨初開出、先以美棉微跌、人心浮盪靡定、且現紗雖較隔昨略昂、但不脫盤旋局面、故八月期開出、尙帶軟勢、入後以外匯逐步緊縮、英美匯暗市均緊至五元與二辦士之內、時金價在升、穿出七千元之外、是以紗市人心隨之興奮、多頭頻頻加碼、空方扒袖允烈、塲中買氣瀰漫、大有山雨欲來之勢、至午收八月期爲一叫五七·五〇、漲起七元、九月期爲一五三四·〇〇、好起十二元、十月期爲一五四七·五〇、軋升十一元五角之多、午後因現紗劇漲、趨勢愈益挺秀、投機家爭先吸收、八月期一度高至一四八〇·〇〇、九月期達一五五四·〇〇、十月期一五六八·〇〇、惟中途因金市回低、乃隨之轉疲、但結果尙較前日軋漲十八元五角至二十八兀不等、觀市價遠勢因現紗客銷未暢、脚地未臻鞏固、是以上漲主因、完全受制外匯與金市、故做多者尙宜審愼將事、茲列全日經過之市價表於後、</p>
<h3>投機活躍　向棉市進</h3>
<p>現棉情况、趨勢允緊、因標金猛騰、外滙改縮、紗市上升、致人心挺秀、棉市隨之增高矣、同業買賣盛旺、扳價觀念愈深矣、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、良以標金猛漲、及美滙緊縮、引起一般投機者及花號家購置現貨、頗屬踴躍、咋日巴西棉之售價、竟較上日又漲七八元左右、但同時又觀於太平洋局聽未見明朗、及上海地位並不十分鞏固、定棉交易、似未見興奮也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、市况不定、而有參次、先因華盛頓政治消息、凍結政府貸款棉花之斯密司議案將於明日發表、及少數空頭抵補而漲、但續後又因多頭了結、及紐奧倫斯賣出而回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日均跌四五磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、昨日休業、</p>
<p>預測今日開盤、市况較昨日的跌一羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米又思高抬</h3>
<p>昨洋米初漲後疲、市　仍見　旋之象、然有大戶客囤吸收、行情終被抬起一元左右、早市開價卽有滬西等大戶注神、旋以市塲中謠諑紛繁、引起搶風頭之皮球幫問津、市價立被踢高、然去路只有大戶散多浮囤所呼吸、實在去路之本客納胃均呆、以致價高之後獲利浮戶羣圖踢出而乏受主兼有新到手貨而主急院、市即不支下落、初漲一二元、結果祗大半元至一元而已、惟小絞現米初自一百二十一元大至一百二十三元半、收市又小至一百二十二元半、英華司雖高一百五十元〇五角、收市又爲一百四十九元半、次一百四十七元半、二號暹米一百四十元〇五角至一百四十元、碎米一百〇五元半、成交計有八九百噸、現米的二萬三四千包、棧存洋米共計一百二十一萬四千〇〇　包云</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、自前朝轉定後、昨則更以來源寥落、且見洋米繼昂、賣買雙方心思均佳、一方旣持貨扳俏、而另一方本鄉店舖、作客互思乘機採購、爭先問津、一時形成似有供不敷求之概、厚薄兩粳行情頓見提高一二元、開南港新鮮早晚稻百五十一元半、决至百四十八元、無錫原包白粳百四十六元、至於浦東新粳昨到計有十六担、開百五十七元、較决者百五十五元以貨品相別、亦增元砠光景、</p>
<p>糯米際此佳檔、去路亦頗活絡、所以售價一致帶高近元、開香港百元高自百二十五元、决至百二十元、糯荼百十四元至百十元、國糯百二十六七元、</p>
<p>粉市蠢然思動</p>
<p>昨現洋粉市况、因銷路活而轉挺、査粉市一週以來、市面頗見平靜、乃以統制洋棧之說小確、及米價平落聲中、市塲供求平衡、金龍粉盤旋於三十二元左右、砲台粉則醞釀於三十三元內外、上落僅二三角、迨至前日金龍粉收市三十一元九角、砲台粉三十三元一角、蓋金龍粉以存底較多、獨較低廉、其他雜牌一致平穩、昨日上午開市、突聞外滙進關、在物價看高之局勢下、售主即抱把守之意、客囤趁機蠢動、是以各貨交易、漸臻活潑、余龍粉開盤三十一元八角半、嗣以米價報升、即開三十一元九角至九角半、砲台粉三十三元一角、午市即扳至三十三元二角、比上日微升一二角、尙有鐘樓牌澳粉因蟲蛀仍開三十三元五角、雙鷹牌三十二元四角半、則已漲起不少、綠寳粉三十二元二三角但未妥交、統市成交的有三萬包、市面似有轉機之象、</p>
<p>小麥市塲、交易仍靜、一週以來、近郊新麥到貨不足三干包、各粉廠雖將門市進價、略有寬放、仍屬無貨可收、聞日廠方面每日收進的有二三百包、價已放至四十四元、華廠進價亦已提升至四十七元五角、但收貨依然寥落、</p>
<h3>油市　藉口到少　油價一再狂抬</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、又復步趨高翔、乃因來源仍滯、申存日趨稀薄、油儈蓄意搗亂、形成油荒氣象、行情遂一致再被抬升五六元、計售開膠州生油，件、價爲一百八十三元半、靑島生油五十桶、二百六十五元、又豆油四十桶、二百五十六元半、大有豆油一百担、二百〇四元至二百〇三元、又淸油五百担、價一百七十元至一百七十、元半、立德廠菜油三百担、價一百六十五元、至一百七十一元半、吉田廠菜油二百担、價一百六十九元至一百七十元、日華廠菜油近千担、價一百六十三元至—百七十二元、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債賣出為多　行市迂迴疲落</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市漸現疲象、大戶雖有抵補、不及傾吐湧旺、買方漸不感興趣、多方瞻前顧後、故亦漸漸出脫、甲種公債今日舉行抽籤、昨日下午所做市價即係除中籤計算、債市前途、當係漸漸的曲綫疲落、暫時尙難進展、昨日上午公茂怡泰信孚均係買進甲種、聯和號入丙出甲、昌記專出甲種、鴻大出甲丙兩種、聯益出丙戊兩種、午收價略小二三角、午後恒康協大聯益買進、協興元及中孚銀行賣出爲多、市况冉小　一角、市價結果、甲種因除中籤關係、計小二元、餘不過略小二角半至四角半、成交總數、共計祇一百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於俊、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司一百投、價為四十一元一角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、因多方略有出籠、價格倏高倏低、收盤始梢轉堅、公共汽車股經數日漲風後、昨已退落元許、收價十八元七角、祥泰木行股亦幾以一週內之低價收盤、</p>
<p>橡　股寗靜、陳氏與加倫丹二股獨吿上漲、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價仍緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市仍因荷輪中止來申之說、雖未能證實、但亦並非無因、故人心仍昂、期貨初鬆後漲、結果無甚上落、八月十日期以一百零七元半開盤、旋升八元·角·五角·而至九元、八月二十日期則先緊後鬆、初爲一百十二元·十二元三角、後爲十一元至十一元七角、小三角、公會劃盤、現貨較緊、七月份到貨二百十元·十二元半·十元零半、升　元二角、六月份一百零九元、九元牛·十元、升一元、五月份一百零八元半·九元半、升一元五角、四月份一百零八元、九元、升一元七角、荷赤KD嘜前日叫九十八元未成者、昨已升至一百元、太古車白B嘜叫　百三十八元、HX嘜叫一百十五元、九日有糖一千包運天津、</p>
<h3>海味　魚皮魚肚俱高昂</h3>
<p>魚皮魚肚邇來到存仍稀、市價逐步轉昂、如公魚皮原貨爲四百五十元至三百六十元白魚皮六百四十元至五百五十元、母皮四百二十元、魚肚史覺高昂、如長膠爲八百五十元、黃魚肚吊片一千二百五十元、黃片八百八十元、廣吐高貨三千元、决之二千二百元、月肚　千五百元、</p>
<h3>糖與蔗糖（四）（中國之部）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>再根據宋朝遂寗人王灼所著糖霜譜所記？『唐大歴間—公元七六六至七九九　有僧號鄒和尙，跨白驢登繖山，在在今四川間中縣—結茅以居。須鹽米薪菜之屬，書寸紙繫錢緡遺驢負至市，人知爲鄒也，取平値，掛物於鞍縱歸。一日，驢犯山下黃氏蔗苗，黃請償於鄒，曰：『汝未知「因蔗糖爲霜」「利當千倍；吾語汝塞責可乎」？試之果然，自此流傳其法……』。從「因蔗糖爲霜」這句語看，當然是把那粗糲的沙糖再加上一番煎熬和凝煉　夫了；然而這樣製出來的「糖霜」還絕對不是我們現在所習見的「白沙糖哩」，因爲糖霜譜緊接着就注明了「淺紫爲上，深琥珀决之，淺黃叉决之，淺白爲下』就是它引證蘇東坡送遂寗儈圓寳「冰盤　琥珀，何似糖霜美』的詩句，也充分表　那糖霜是彷彿琥珀色的，而不是李時珍所說的「輕白如霜」啊。雖說淸人梁紹壬（兩般秋雨盫隨筆）見糖霜譜引證黃山谷答梓州雍熙長義寄糖霜的「遠寄糖霜知有味，勝於崔子水晶鹽』的詩句，以爲這是指的白沙糖而言：我則以爲這也明明是拿糖的「滋味」　鹽作對比，並不曾說到糖的顏色和那水晶鹽一般哩，所以這兩句詩也不能當作我國在那時已竟會製造白沙糖的憑據（未完）</p>

<p>關於注射防疫針一事，曾經有過幾位讀者來稿發表意見。有人以爲公共衛生機關派人在路口替人打針，有時候是不大適合衛生原則的。因爲一四有時候未經消毒手續，一針要連打幾個人；二則份量方面頗成問題；三則平常到醫生處去打總是打三决，在馬路上祇打一决。另外有些穿白衣的服務員的態度，實在令人不敢領敎。這些是負責當局所應設法加以改善的。</p>
<p>除了以上幾點以外，打防疫針太身富然是無可非議的。爲了愛護自己的性命，爲了顧全公衆的衛生，每個有機會的人，都該享受打針的權利！</p>
<p>今天發表了一位注射員令人啼笑皆非的自述，這是從另外一方面的看法。除了自己的觀點以外，能够替別人設身處地一下，站在別人崗位上去觀察社會，往往可以使我們得到了許多新的感想與敎訓。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>我祇是一名注射員</h3>
<p>— 隱之</p>
<p>二年來，我對於自己的職位，顯然是失望了：懷着滿腔熱烈的情緒，去幹那「服務社會」，「造福人羣」的工作，却受到人們惡意的唾駡。這不能不使我痛心疾首了。</p>
<p>當每决穿上厚厚的白長衫，站立在十字街頭，看見路人走近的時候，就輕輕地說：「朋友，來，打一針，這是爲了你自己底健康。」</p>
<p>「呸！誰要。」許許多多尖削，鋒芒，無情的嘴是這樣回答。</p>
<p>我禁不住額上掛下汗珠，勉强地站着。無聊時，我悵望蔚藍的天空，「唉！人竟是這樣無知冷酷的嗎？」我喃喃自語，心靈上就蒙了一層灰黯。</p>
<p>「這，苦力們仇視，先生們鄙視的工作，我怎能忍受下去呢？」每當受了路人的嘲笑，諷譏，唾駡以後，我氣憤得竟預備辭職。但爲了要生活，我不得不像罪犯似的走上我的刑塲——十字街頭。</p>
<p>朋友，你看，局長先生爲了工作太劣的緣故，摸着八字鬍髭，打着流利的法國話，嘰哩咕嚕地訓斥，不，簡直是侮辱。</p>
<p>「……中國人是無知，愚蠢，不知好歹的東西。勸解是無效，應該强迫，是的，把中國人當作……。」</p>
<p>啊！我怎能說下去呢？我也是有氣，有血，有心肝的中國人。</p>
<p>之後，每二組中就多添了一個羅宋幫手。</p>
<p>他們用粗壯茸毛的手，把路人像抓小鷄般拖過來，於是逃的逃，跑的跑，吵吵鬧鬧地亂作一堆。本來是「門庭冷落」的，現在却把一只小方桌圍得密密層層。</p>
<p>每决，當人們經過了注射以後，都惡狠狠的掃射我一眼，他們和他們從「羅松鬼」那裹飽受的惡氣，蜂針似地向我發洩：「嘿！認得你。」</p>
<p>「噫！幹嗎？朋友，這是爲了你自己底健康。」我不厭麻煩地一遍，二遍，數十遍地解釋。</p>
<p>「赤老！走狗！亡國奴的走狗！打，打，打什麽斷命針，黑良心，×哪，害得我臂膀酸痛，夜裏發寒熱。」</p>
<p>「發寒熱是反應，沒有妨礙的；暫時的酸痛能予你的生命以保障。」我又像傳敎士般地解釋。</p>
<p>「！哪，瞎說誰要你打？死是死我自己，與你有什麼關係？一不要你伏地叩頭，二不要你穿蔴帶喪。」人們露出鑲金牙齒，咯吱咯吱地獰笑了。</p>
<p>我擦一下臉上被濺的飛沫，忍耐地回答：「朋友，但這是要傳染的呀！譬如說：你發時疫死了，你底家屬和四週的隣居，都要受到病菌的威脅，若是他們未經注射防疫針，也將步你底後塵哩！」</p>
<p>「呸！觸什麼霉頭。」</p>
<p>「Jackson，別和他們　嘛。」羅松鬼不耐煩地高聲喊叫，瘋魔般向入們推，擠，拖，拉。</p>
<p>「嘿！赤佬！走狗！」千萬隻兇狠的目光釘住着我，啊！我底心靈沉入苦海中了。</p>
<p>朋友，我並不如你們想像中的走狗，我是有氣，有血，有心肝的中國人。我們是站在同一的陣綫上。不過注射防疫針，這究竟是爲了你們自己底健康。（移酬捐貸學金）</p>

<h3>日新月異的發明</h3>
<p>— 硯夫</p>
<p>自從戰事爆發以來，英國已有幾千種的新發明，其中很有許多是可供實用而有益於人類的。在美國也有很多很多的新發明。不過在他們的新發明之中，有的固然十分有用，有的却大可引人發笑。下面是幾種確已得到特許專利的：</p>
<p>（一）不見鏡片的眼鏡</p>
<p>（二）捉賊的窗。道窗能够乘那倫兒在窗檻上爬過半個身體的時候，把他攔腰被住。</p>
<p>（三）內部裝有放光構造的棺木。</p>
<p>（四）擺動繩索拍擊酣睡者的臉，使他驚醒的鬧鐘。</p>
<p>（五）印有看不見的廣吿的香烟。在香烟燃着而吸用時，這廣告便顯露出來了。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>她想父親不是立刻要她上城裏去嗎？去的時候，少不得總要把學膳費交給她，那時候要在這筆數目裏分出五塊錢或十塊錢來給尙老二，倒是絕對不成問題的；而同時她又想：尙老二一起祇敎了她半個多月的戲，大不了送他十塊錢，總可以把這件事抹過了吧？</p>
<p>「就這樣辦吧！」她決定不再管秋海棠此刻在外面跟孟大嫂怎樣說，且等晚上再去向她賠話了。</p>
<p>直到第七决她再把鍋蓋揭開，那十幾個餑餑才算蒸熟了，同時她也察覺鍋子裹的水放得太多了，所以熟得這樣慢。她急急把四個餑餑裝在一只小碟子裏，早外斟了一鍾熱茶，做一盤子端出去。</p>
<p>「怎麽？孟大嫂已走了嗎？」她一出去就看見自己的父親一個人坐在堂屋裏，垂着頭，好像很有心事的樣子。</p>
<p>「走了。」</p>
<p>「你吿訴她我不去學戲了嗎？她可有什麼話沒有？」梅寳一面把餑餑和茶放在秋海棠近身的一張桌子上，一面很焦急地問。</p>
<p>秋海棠祇把熱茶取起來喝了一口，並不注意那幾個餑餑。</p>
<p>「吿訴她了。」他沒精打采地回答：「這件事怎麽還能擱下去呢？她聽我一說也就回去了。」</p>
<p>梅寳聽了，還道事情已經結束，不由便從臉上透出了一些安慰的笑容來。（一八〇）</p>

<h3>兩用雙層小茶几</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>在現代家庭生活中，因空間有限之故，對於各種傢具，均須設法加以利用，以簡單而經濟爲原則。故歐美各國業已有沙發牀及壁上牀之發明。前者白晝可作沙發，晚間可改成牀舖，後者鑲入壁閒，對於空間經濟，極有裨益。最近復有人發明雙層小茶几一種，上層爲鏡子所製成者，平時可作茶几之用，放置杯盤花瓶，唯於必要時，則可改造爲化裝桌，亦異想天開之新發明也。</p>
<p>這種種新發明物，都已送上美國的市塲；各個發明者都在希望從他的發明物上交財運。究竟如何，固然要等着瞧，可是其中總有幾件能立刻賺上十萬八萬，那是不用懷疑的。看看人家的新發明這樣多，我們該作何感想？</p>

<h3>夏夜聽音樂</h3>
<p>— 古心</p>
<p>到上海的半年中，音樂會聽了不少。有一位「音樂會」的朋友，帶我到每個音樂會去。從二月到現在，足足聽了近四十個不同性質的演奏會。其中有交響樂的，鋼琴的，絃樂合奏的，中國古樂和個人獨唱的等等不同性質的演奏；但也許是心緒不好之故，多半音樂會沒有耐心聽完。有些演奏得不怎麽好，有些選的曲很壞；正視現實旣談不到，即　「純音樂」地令人忘去現實也不能因爲演奏不够「神化」，於是我往往拉着「音樂通」的朋友溜走了。</p>
<p>最近有了一次例外，那是偶而見到報上實騐音樂社的消息：這消息，連那「音樂通」的朋友也小大關心，大有可不必聽的意思。然而那晚我例外的偷偷地獨自找到俄國藝術劇院去試聽一下「音樂通」的朋友不關心的音樂會，那天天氣旣熱，有如洗蒸汽浴一般。台上出現了合唱，「杜那亦夫司基集」；才知差不多一半節目已經奏過了。</p>
<p>歌曲都是熟悉的，只是好久不曾聽見了；這一串珍珠似的歌曲好像召回了我的靈魂，恢復了我失却的記憶。</p>
<p>我以爲我是這會塲中僅有的知音，當「祖國歌」完的時候要作第一個鼓掌的人，然而全塲的掌聲響了起來，我聽不見自己的存在。座旁的不相識的以和善的弟兄的眼看着我，說「好——眞好！」我發現他全身和額上都是汗，那時才想到自己是和他一樣忘記了氣候。</p>
<p>休息之後我又進劇塲去受「洗禮」；都是非常明快沾新的作品，最後的三首合唱都好，最難忘的是「從邊疆到邊疆」和圖畫一樣的「司巧司之歌」。</p>
<p>散會後我和那座旁的朋友交談起來，他用常州口音的國語向我表示他是「實音迷」之一。我問他爲什麼不作經常而普及的演出呢？現在的座價似乎太高。他說，「那末我們寫一封信去要求一决普及塲吧」。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Southward Invasion Situation Intensifies; China and Britain Cooperate to Defend the Burma Road; China Plans Defense Initiatives and Stations Heavy Troops in Yunnan; British Far East Air Force Greatly Strengthened with American Aid</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: The general impression is that the tense situation in the Far East has become more acute. Japanese newspapers continue to publish uncompromising and provocative discussions. Official spokespersons and radio stations adopt the same trend, delivering lengthy speeches attempting to portray the aggression of democratic countries. Their aim is to conquer Thailand and encircle Japan. The "Japan Times," directly under the control of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has even begun a propaganda campaign for the independence of the Dutch East Indies, effectively inciting British and American intervention in Batavia, and claiming that an independent Dutch East Indies would cooperate with Japan. Every message coming from Bangkok indicates that the Thai people are well aware of where the threat comes from. Today, Bangkok Radio mentioned rumors of Japanese troops concentrating on the Thai border and a three-pronged military attack within three days. Singapore has released exciting news about the strength of the British Far East Air Force, stating that high-speed American-made fighters are now flying over the Burma Road to new bases in Burma, ready to intercept any bombing of the Burma Road that the Japanese might attempt from their new bases in Vietnam. New airfields in Burma are also stationed with British bombers, hindering any westward advance by Japan. The Chinese government is also taking steps to resist the Japanese offensive on the Burma Road. The Chinese Supreme Command has drafted a defense plan, and Chinese troops have been deployed within Yunnan Province, bordering Vietnam. News from Saigon states that some British expatriates there are scheduled to depart for Singapore on Sunday, although they have not received official instructions to leave.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain is now planning to go beyond diplomatic negotiations and economic retaliation, and cooperate fully with the United States to take new steps to stop aggressive actions. These steps may be used against Japan in the future. Britain's attitude relies solely on American assistance.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th: Secretary of State Hull met with Australian Federal Minister to the US, Casey, today to discuss the Far East situation. Afterwards, Minister Casey declined to comment on Japan's southward advance policy, only stating that the Australian Federation firmly believes that the most suitable place to defend Australia is far beyond its coast.</p>
<p>United Press, Melbourne, 8th: Australian Navy Minister Hughes declared yesterday that war or peace in the Pacific depends on Japan's attitude. He stated, "The so-called encirclement by Japan is nonsense. They have now established themselves on territory fifty times larger than mainland Japan."</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: The warnings against Japanese aggression in Thailand issued simultaneously by British Foreign Secretary Eden and Secretary of State Hull have made a great impression here. It is generally believed that Hull's remarks are good, but more detailed statements are needed to effectively eliminate the specter of war in the Far East. The Thai-Japanese situation currently appears calm on the surface, but the worrisome undercurrents have not been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Thailand Resolves to Defend Its Territorial Integrity Regardless of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 8th: Sources close to the Prime Minister told United Press reporters yesterday that Thailand has no intention of allowing foreign countries to use bases within its territory. When asked about contradictory rumors that Britain and Japan had requested bases from Thailand, the source stated that even if such requests were made, the government had no intention of yielding. He stated that Thailand is prepared to resist any action that endangers Thailand's independence and territorial integrity. At the same time, there are widespread rumors here that there will be changes in the American diplomatic mission.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of American Cotton Cloth Soon to Be Shipped to China for Use in Making Clothing for the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 8th: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that administrators of the Lend-Lease Act had ordered 10 million yards of cotton fabric for use in making clothing for Chinese soldiers. Morgenthau stated that the cotton fabric would be used to manufacture uniforms for the Chinese army. He also mentioned that this move had been approved a few days ago. The Treasury Secretary stated that he had met with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky, but that he believed they had discussed US-Soviet financial issues. Morgenthau announced that the government had given notice to a silk factory in Chile, allowing it to recover stored silk from a contracted stockpile for weaving parachutes for the US Army paratroopers.</p>
<h3>Japan Busily Deploying Troops Southward and Preparing to Attack Northward, Waiting for the Opportunity to Act</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: London newspapers recently carried news from responsible sources in London that Thailand is "undoubtedly in a dangerous situation," under headlines as long as seven or eight columns. The newspapers also gave special prominence to news of Japanese troop movements and the Tokyo Radio Station's announcement yesterday that "war may break out at any time." According to information received by responsible persons in London, the Japanese have concentrated attack-capable troops in eastern Harbin and northern Manchuria, one hundred miles from Vladivostok. Japanese troops in Vietnam have occupied Tay Ninh, which is only 250 miles from Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, which is in a dangerous situation. It is believed here that if Japan takes military action, Thailand will do its utmost to resist. In recent weeks, Japan has sent reinforcements to its 250,000 troops stationed in Northeast China and North Korea, and there is evidence that defensive positions are being constructed. It is not difficult for Japan to send troops through Lushun and Dalian to reinforce its troops stationed in North China and Korea, but the strength of the Soviet army in Siberia is very strong. The Soviet Far East Army totals one million men, who are well-trained and equipped, and commanded by capable generals. Japan must station a large part of its troops in China, which is a disadvantage. Japan has now landed 50,000 troops in Vietnam and occupied eight airfields. Thailand's army totals 50,000 men with limited equipment. Its air force personnel are limited, but brave and good at fighting. It is believed here that if Japan attempts to attack Singapore, it will exhaust all its strength and still fail. Britain has allocated huge sums of money to make Singapore stronger. The quality of the British air force there is unmatched by Japan, and reinforcements have recently been sent to strengthen the defense. The Malay chiefs are also enthusiastically cooperating in defense plans for their country. Burma is also in a very favorable position and will be able to repel foreign attacks.</p>
<h3>Far East Interests Seriously Threatened; Britain and the United States Can No Longer Tolerate Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: This morning, major London newspapers carried stern criticisms of Japan, accusing it of having two faces and conducting the same newspaper propaganda campaign as it did before invading Vietnam. The Times stated that Japan seems to have decided to disregard the warnings of Britain and the United States, and after occupying Vietnam, will continue with actions against Thailand. Japan's naval bases in Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, and air force bases in western Vietnam, are serious threats to the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, Malaya, and in fact the entire southern Pacific region. If Japan were allowed to gain a foothold in Thailand, this threat would become intolerable. Regardless of how eager the Thai government is to maintain its independence, it may not be able to resist the pressure exerted by Japan unless it is absolutely certain that it can rely on the immediate assistance of Britain and the United States. Regarding the reported belief among the people of Hong Kong that unless Japan is warned against further advances, war will break out and Thailand will soon follow in the footsteps of Vietnam, given the dangerous situation of Britain's major interests and the difficulty of stopping the Japanese once they advance, there is no doubt about this belief. British public opinion on this matter can be seen in the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Eden on this matter. The newspaper also mentioned that Japan is not satisfied with threatening Thailand in the south, and is also deploying troops northward in Manchuria to threaten the Soviet Union. Germany may be willing for Japan to attack northward to provide effective assistance to the German forces who are currently facing setbacks on their way to Moscow, but the Soviet troops in eastern Siberia appear to be superior to the troops that Japan can deploy there, and the Soviet Union's position in Vladivostok is of great importance. If Japan attacks there, the blow to Britain will be no less than that to its ally, the Soviet Union. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that Japan has two faces, saying that Japan's formal response to the warnings of British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull against actions in Thailand indicates that it has been misunderstood and that its intentions are purely peaceful, while at the same time, Japanese broadcasters are ordered to propagate to their people that war may break out at any time, and Japanese newspapers are also daily carrying out their roars towards Britain and the United States. While Japan is practicing two faces, its Prime Minister Konoe has repeatedly met with the Emperor for consultations. The newspaper also stated that Thailand cannot be unaware of the threat to itself, and the people of Thailand will certainly not welcome being exploited by Japan. In short, few countries in the East would want Japan as their master. If the Thai people resist aggression, they will receive immediate assistance, as Britain and the United States both recognize that Japan's invasion of Thailand will threaten their interests and security.</p>
<h3>Thailand Refuses Japanese Aircraft from Flying to Bangkok; Border Demarcation Meeting between Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan May Not Be Held as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 8th: Thai representatives of the border demarcation committee, including Shangmi, have arrived here. The Japanese planned to send a four-engine seaplane from Saigon to Bangkok to transport them, but it is heard that Thailand has now refused Japanese aircraft from flying to Bangkok.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 8th: The government announced last night that the Japanese delegation, chaired by Yano, had arrived in Saigon to demarcate the border between Vietnam and Thailand. At the same time, another report stated that the situation in Thailand is tense because Bangkok declared its recognition of Manchukuo and because Britain is increasing its troops in Singapore. The Thai delegation for border demarcation is expected to arrive in Saigon at any time. The first plenary session will be held on Sunday and will continue until the end of August. After the meeting, all representatives will go to the border area in early September to demarcate the border line on the ground.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Issues During the Autumn Flood Season</h3>
<p>The rainy season has just passed, and the typhoon season is approaching. The peak of the autumn flood season is coming. This is usually not considered important in urban life, but today's concessions often see vehicles driving through water and boats navigating the land. Wading in shallow or deep water has become a common sight after heavy rains. The problem of water accumulation has become more prevalent in recent years, and we have seen it twice this year. Although we have heard explanations for why the water is difficult to drain, we have not seen any efforts to dredge or prevent flooding. Therefore, the inconvenience caused to the public by autumn floods will likely only worsen.</p>
<p>The reason for water accumulation in the concessions is said to be the failure of the Huangpu River to drain properly, leading to water accumulation after heavy rains. When high tide suddenly arrives, the drainage pipes flow upwards. The responsibility for this lies where it lies, and we do not want to dwell on it, but one only needs to look at why this phenomenon did not exist before the war to understand that a child deprived of milk is pitiable, and that weather needs care! However, the cause of the blockage is not limited to this. The drainage pipes in the International Settlement flow east to the Huangpu River and north and south into the Wusong River, and the ships moored on both sides of the Wusong River leave only a narrow channel for boats to pass, obstructing the water flow and making it prone to accumulation. As the tide ebbs and flows, the water recedes and sand remains. The mouths of the drainage pipes are easily blocked, and the water on the ground loses its outlet, making it difficult to drain. This may be one reason, so dredging the Huangpu must also include dredging the Wusong. As for the sewage in the French Concession, it has always relied on the Huangpu River, the Lujiabang, the Rihui Port, and the Puzhao River for drainage, but today the road east of Rihui Port to the Huangpu has become a thoroughfare, and the Puzhao and Rihui Ports are heavily silted up. The large canals are unfavorable, and the small ditches are difficult to drain. The western districts of the two concessions used to have many open fields with crisscrossing rivers, which could have slightly compensated for the inadequacy of the canals and stored some of the surface water, but they have all been blocked and buried by road and building construction projects, cutting them off horizontally and vertically. The accumulated water has nowhere to go, so the western districts are prone to waterlogging. Furthermore, due to the different development of the city, the old roads cannot accommodate the huge, heavy, fast, and powerful vehicles without being widened; similarly, the drainage pipes cannot accommodate the sewage discharged by a densely populated area without being rebuilt and enlarged. However, the reconstruction of the engineering is not easy, so the extent and depth of the waterlogged areas almost increase with the increase in population and households. Even when the roads were initially built, there was no consideration of the terrain, water level, rainfall, and prosperity of the market to plan the width and thickness of the road surface and the layout and size of the drainage pipes. If all these factors had been considered, there would have been no accumulation of water. But what is the situation now? It cannot be said that the initial planning was poor and narrow-minded, leading to this failure!</p>
<p>We are not unaware that in this environment, public construction is impossible and financially infeasible. However, the inconvenience to the public caused by water accumulation is now at its worst and cannot be ignored. The lives of people in Shanghai today are different from the past. Going out in the morning and returning in the evening has become the norm. Furthermore, due to the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market, rents are high, so people have retreated from the bustling areas to remote areas. However, convenient transportation has become inconvenient. What they usually rely on to travel long distances and still get to work on time is public transportation, which alleviates their difficulties and facilitates their travel. Now, whenever there is water accumulation, public transportation vehicles shorten their routes or even stop. We have not heard of any consideration for public convenience or any prompt measures to restore the vehicles to operation as soon as possible. On the roads, every step is through water, submerging the ankles; inside the houses, dirty water flows in and out, making it impossible to live in peace. We have not heard of any quick drainage work to allow the water to recede as soon as possible. As for the water that surges upwards from the drainage pipes, it is unbearably smelly, and germs breed, invading the human body, causing illness and even death, or prolonged illness that becomes a lifelong burden. The impact of water accumulation on public health, daily life, and welfare is so profound that it cannot be regarded as one of the most serious problems in society. Moreover, the rainfall in Shanghai this year has been the highest in history. In June, it was 10.08 inches, and in July, it was 9.25 inches, far exceeding the same period last year, indicating that the rainy season this year has been abundant. It is difficult to predict what the rainfall will be like in the future. However, yesterday (August 8th) was the first day of autumn, and it coincided with a typhoon sweeping through the city. There was wind and rain all day long, and the low-lying areas saw the third water accumulation. We also heard that the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been rising continuously, reaching 80 feet, breaking a 30-year record. We do not remember the water level in the upper reaches being so high in 1931. The areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei and Anhui were flooded, and refugees flooded down the river, and Shanghai set up shelters to accommodate them until the January 28th Incident, when they were all evacuated. Now, the water from the upper reaches is pouring down in a torrent. The levees in central Hubei may not be able to withstand the vast and turbulent force, and will likely become swamps. If the Han River also floods, Wuhan will be in danger of sinking. As the water flows eastward, can the low-lying areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui remain intact? In peacetime, Shanghai is still plagued by tides. If the Yangtze River is high, although the lower reaches are wide, the deposition of sediment will greatly constrict the flow of the flood, preventing it from flowing naturally to the sea. If it flows backwards into the Huangpu River and is attracted by the tidal currents, it will float upwards for a long time, making Shanghai a possible habitat for water creatures. Wouldn't it be too late to plan for flood prevention and drainage work at that time?</p>
<p>Autumn rains cannot be avoided, and typhoons cannot be prevented. Given Shanghai's large population, thriving commerce, and heavy burdens, all measures should be taken to prevent problems before they occur, and what citizens should enjoy should be prepared in advance. The problem of water accumulation on roads is so severe and occurs so often that even if the entire engineering improvement cannot be realized immediately, efforts should be made to improve the situation whenever and wherever possible. In the future, when roads and houses are built, all drainage facilities should meet the required standards. Before everything is fully improved, reasonable drainage pumping stations should be planned quickly so that temporary water accumulation can be eliminated in an instant, unlike the current situation where water accumulates for many days and does not recede. More attention should be paid to the operation of public transportation vehicles, not only to avoid inconvenience to people, but also to provide as much convenience as possible for people to travel to and from work, which is the duty of the municipal government and does not need to be discussed.</p>
<h3>Meeting Between US and British Leaders Becomes Open Secret; Importance of this Move Undeniable; US Military Leaders Not in Washington</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th: After President Roosevelt set sail on the yacht "Potomac," he issued his first communiqué, which did not mention a meeting between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, only stating that the President had learned of international developments via radio. Although it is generally known that this yacht is currently in the waters of the New England states, the official position remains silent on where it will sail.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th: As far as Washington insiders are concerned, the rumors of a Roosevelt-Churchill meeting are no longer considered mysterious. It is generally believed that the two leaders are likely to meet. There are only two places Churchill can go: either Moscow or the United States to meet with the US President. It is speculated that if Churchill went to the Soviet capital, news would inevitably leak out, so it is concluded that he must be coming to meet with President Roosevelt. The focus is not on whether the two leaders will meet, but on the reason for the meeting. Some political observers believe that this decision is a precursor to important events and steps, and some speculate that Hopkins has returned from Moscow with urgent news that the Soviet Union must be aided with all efforts to stop the German advance. If these two leaders do hold a meeting, it will be a temporary gathering without prior exchange of opinions or arrangements, and its importance is evident. There is reason to believe that the State Department is unaware of the arrangements for this meeting, so the content of the meeting is known only to President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Hopkins. It is also believed here that if the US Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Navy Knox were indeed with the President, Churchill would not necessarily go, because the US Congress would inevitably react politically to the British Prime Minister talking to the US military leaders. However, it is known that Generals Marshall and Arnold of the General Staff are both traveling elsewhere, far from the President's location, and Secretary of the Navy Knox and Chief of Naval Operations Stark have also not gone to the President's location.</p>
<h3>Thailand Willing to Maintain Open Door Policy; No Favoritism Towards Britain or Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: Thai Commerce Superintendent Panalongda, one of the Thai representatives to the Tokyo mediation meeting, told reporters that the Thai market is not closed to any country, and Britain has always been able to obtain the supply of Thai goods as needed. Japan has not made any economic demands on Thailand. The Japanese spokesperson's statement yesterday that economic negotiations between Japan and Thailand are still in progress refers to Japan's recent loan of 10 million Thai baht from a Thai banking group. Thailand maintains an open door policy for all countries trading with Thailand and does not want to give special treatment to any country. When asked about the possibility of Japan demanding exclusive rights to Thai rice, tin, and rubber, Panalongda replied that this is unlikely, as Japan has already purchased large quantities of these goods. A newspaper reported that Thailand rejected more than ten Japanese requests before finally agreeing to recognize Manchukuo. The Thai Ministry of Finance stated that Thailand's funds abroad are currently safe and sound, and there is no basis for the rumor that they have been frozen. Most of Thailand's funds are deposited in Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 8th: Official sources believe that the Japanese rumor that China, Britain, and the United States have protested to Thailand over Thailand's recognition of Manchukuo is not true. No matter what, China cannot protest because there are no diplomatic relations between China and Thailand.</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Send Special Envoy to Vietnam to Promote Friendly Relations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 8th: It is heard that the government has decided to send a special envoy to Vietnam to promote friendly relations between the two countries. The selection of the person is currently being considered by the Foreign Minister.</p>

<h3>Chinese Army in Hubei Closes in on Shashi; Expands Gains Near Yichang; Captures Many Important Strongholds</h3>
<p>Changde: A certain mobile unit of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the Japanese army in Shashi's offense, attacked Shashi by detour with extremely rapid action. At 6:00 PM on the 7th, it had advanced to the vicinity of Shashi and is currently launching a fierce attack on Shashi. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Enshi: The war near Yichang is progressing smoothly for the Chinese army, and it is now expanding its gains. The Japanese army in the area of Jujihe and Shibanwan (north of Yichang) was completely defeated by the Chinese army on the 5th. More than 100 Japanese troops are still on the line from Longwangdong to Xiaoxita, and they are also under the control of the Chinese army. The important strongholds of the Japanese army on the opposite bank of the Xiling Gorge in western Yichang, such as Xiangzikou, Yujiapu, and Sunjiaqiao (west of Meiyanzi), have been recaptured by the Chinese army after days of attacks. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain place in southern Anhui: The Japanese army that invaded from the east was repelled by the Chinese army at noon on the 3rd. The Japanese army in the direction of Tuqiao has also been completely cleared, and the original situation was restored that night. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>A part of the Japanese army in Dongliu launched a three-pronged invasion on the morning of the 3rd. After fierce fighting until noon, all were repelled. At 1:00 AM on the 3rd, a group landed from Dawang in Dongliu and immediately invaded Huabaizikeng, Tuyan, and other places. After the joint attack by the Chinese army and the people, the Japanese army dispersed. A group invaded Zhangjianzhen, Heshanling, Majie, and other places from the Wai Fengjian in the south. The Chinese army resisted all the way, and the Japanese army was unable to hold on and retreated, and Zhangjianzhen and other places were often announced to be recovered. A group, under the cover of Japanese artillery, launched a fierce attack on Zhoujiashan in China. After the Chinese army resisted, after fierce fighting until 7:00 AM, the Japanese army also retreated. The Chinese army followed up and pursued, and obtained countless spoils of war. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese army that landed in Donglou, Xiwanyueyang, and Qianjiang on the opposite bank was surrounded by the Chinese army, and by midnight, it was completely cleared. There is no trace of the Japanese in that area now. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: Since the 3rd, there has been fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the area north of Haozui. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. At 3:00 PM yesterday, many wounded Japanese soldiers were transported north from Caojiazui via Yangjiazui. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chinese Army Dominates in the War This Week</p>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesperson reported on the war situation, saying that there were two more important battles this week. One was the Japanese army's attempt to strike at the Chinese army north of Yichang in order to reduce the threat to Yichang. The other was the joint attack on Haozui by the Japanese army in Shashi, Shayang, and Qianjiang. Haozui is located between Yueyang and Jingzhou, controlling the traffic between the two, and it is rich in materials and a channel for the Chinese army to cross the river. Therefore, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on it with more than 6,000 troops in four directions starting from the 3rd. Only one of them advanced to a place 6-7 kilometers from Haozui, and the rest made no progress. As for the war in northern Yichang, the Japanese army attacked northwest from Shanlongquanpu with more than 1,000 troops on the 24th of last month, but was repelled by the Chinese army in Fenxiangchang. They then reinforced and attacked again on the 27th. After fierce fighting until the 29th, they were still defeated. Then, they gathered 13,000 troops between Yichang and Dangyang and advanced west in three directions on the 30th. The Chinese army then crossed the river to the west bank north of Yichang, gathered its forces, and launched a fierce attack on the middle and right wings of the Japanese army on the 2nd. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, leaving behind 1,700 corpses and a large number of weapons, and retreated to their original positions. However, their left wing, with reinforcements from Yichang, crossed the river on the 4th and broke through a part of the Chinese army's positions. But we have just received a report from the front that the Chinese army has restored its original positions. The spokesperson explained this battle, saying that the Japanese initially attacked with more than 1,000 troops, but were eventually forced to increase to 13,000 troops. This proves that the theory of mud feet is not credible. (7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Hunan, Jiangxi, etc.; Chinese Losses Very Slight; Intention Clearly to Disrupt Transportation; Yan'an in Northern Shaanxi Attacked for the First Time</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A military spokesperson today answered reporters' questions, saying that the Japanese planes have been bombing various parts of Hunan for days, their intention clearly being to disrupt transportation. Speaking from the perspective of vehicles in transit, this action might be somewhat more effective than bombing Chongqing, but fortunately, Chinese losses are very slight. Furthermore, Yan'an, the base of the Eighteenth Group Army, was bombed, marking the first time since the start of the war. The reason for Japan's sudden move is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Ji'an – In the past week, Japanese planes have frequently attacked western Jiangxi. At 2:00 PM on the 7th, 27 Japanese planes again attacked Ji'an, Taihe, and other places in batches. The first batch of nine planes invaded Fenyi and dropped bombs. The second batch of nine planes first dropped bombs on Zhangshu, then flew to Ji'an and dropped many incendiary bombs. The third batch of nine planes flew through Zhangshu and Jishui into Ji'an, dropped several more bombs, and then flew to Taihe to drop bombs, before retreating north successively. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Xi'an – Seven Japanese planes bombed Baoji again at 5:50 AM on the 7th, while another three planes disturbed the Gansu border, flying over Lanzhou, Tianshui, and the surrounding areas along the river, spying before retreating east. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fiercely Bomb Chongqing</p>
<p>Chongqing – More than 80 Japanese planes fiercely bombed Chongqing at 2:30 PM today, causing significant damage and a few casualties. Air defense outposts had detected a total of 136 Japanese planes flying towards Chongqing, but it is estimated that only 70 to 80 actually participated in the attack. The Japanese planes dropped bombs along the south bank of the upper reaches of the Xizijiang River, from the safe zone and Jiangbei District to the Jialing River bank. The first batch of Japanese planes bombed the lower areas of Chongqing's main city and the southern bank area upstream from the safe zone at 1:30 PM. By 2:30 PM, the second batch of Japanese planes concentrated their bombing on the western district. The Press Association building was also bombed, and although it was not damaged, it was severely shaken. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Conscription Bill; Military Service Extended by Two and a Half Years</h3>
<p>Washington, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – The Senate passed a bill yesterday authorizing the War Department to extend the term of service for conscripted soldiers, the National Guard, and reservists to 18 months or two and a half years. The bill also authorizes the Army to extend the service of enlisted soldiers by 18 months in addition to their three years of formal service. The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives for discussion.</p>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch, 7th – According to an announcement by the War Department, the U.S. active military force totals 1,581,000 personnel, of which 1,669,500 are soldiers.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on the European War (7) (3) An Eyewitness Account of Escorting Across the Atlantic</h3>
<p>We have reached the danger zone.</p>
<p>We are approaching Malin Head off the coast of Donegal, the northernmost tip of Ireland, and the sunlight shines on the emerald green hills. Our ships, still in close formation, continue to move forward. The destroyers that have been accompanying us are bustling, moving back and forth, but we know that every destroyer is acting according to plan. Submarine attacks have been prevented. The sea is quite calm, and a few white clouds hang listlessly in the pale blue sky. We struggled through storms for several days, and now the weather is fine. In fact, the weather today seems a little too good. In this kind of calm weather, submarines are not impacted by huge waves and do not expose their thick steel hulls, so they are not easily discovered. Dive bombers also like clear weather.</p>
<p>A destroyer two miles to the left, which had been leisurely, suddenly became active, revving its engines and rushing towards the harbor. From its four smokestacks, it can be seen that it is an old American destroyer. A large waterfall suddenly flew up on the sea thirty yards from its stern. Five seconds later, an explosion occurred, and even our large cargo ship shook violently. The destroyer had found a submarine and dropped a depth charge. Another old American destroyer came to help. A Lockheed Hudson aircraft from our coastal air command was escorting us, and two more, flying less than fifty feet high, were identifying the exact location of the submarine above the destroyers.</p>
<p>Two more fountains flew straight up, and the sunlight shone on the water spray, seeming to dance in the clear and gentle air. Then the sound of explosions came again, and our ship shook again.</p>
<p>The destroyers darted back and forth like small hounds, and the two Hudson aircraft roared happily. Finally, the destroyers resumed their patrol work, and the aircraft flew back and hovered over the convoy again. A destroyer signaled with a signal lamp.</p>
<p>The first mate ran down from the bridge and told us that the destroyer had hit a submarine, and a large oil slick had surfaced on the sea. The "Asdic" indicator could no longer find its location.</p>
<p>Several ships have left us and sailed to another port. The journey is indeed long, but the convoy is not traveling in a straight line. We have sailed far north, zigzagging, and changing course every few hours.</p>
<p>We have been well protected from beginning to end. Gradually, we sailed out of the dangerous area patrolled by German raiders in the North Atlantic, and finally entered the submarine-infested sea. More than nine-tenths of the ships we lost were sunk in the eastern Atlantic. Now we need another kind of protection. We need fast destroyers as the ears of the convoy to detect and destroy submarines. We also need aircraft as the eyes of the convoy to fight against German dive bombers. As we passed through the North Sea Strait, through the Irish Sea, we knew that the battlefields on the shore were waiting for us to be attacked by German aircraft. From the moment we saw land, the distance between Spitfires and Hurricanes and us would be no more than fifteen minutes. The Navy and Air Force both protected us, and the coordination was very good.</p>
<p>I took a cargo ship from Canada, crossed the Atlantic, and am now docked in a British port, writing this report during a large meal. I know that of the ships that left Canada with us, there were more than fifty in total, and by this evening, every one of them had arrived in a British port.</p>
<p>Mines, of course, often pose a threat to convoys. Mines can be divided into three types: the ordinary floating mines used in the last European war, anchored magnetic mines, and tethered contact mines. German mines are anchored because floating mines drift with the wind and can also endanger German submarines. Mine anchor chains are rarely longer than forty inches or one hundred and forty feet, so if the convoy knows that the water under the ship is more than forty inches deep, it does not need to worry about mines. However, sometimes it is not like that.</p>
<p>Four days ago, I was standing on the deck with the chief engineer when we suddenly heard two sharp and piercing bells. The lookout on the crow's nest had spotted something.</p>
<p>At this time, the waves were surging. I looked to starboard but saw nothing. Looking back, I saw the gunners gathered behind the guns. I borrowed binoculars from the chief engineer—readers should know that only military reporters in movies carry binoculars with them—but still saw nothing. A destroyer—another old American destroyer—turned around like a whirlwind, standing between our cargo ship and the ships on the starboard side. At this time, I saw something black sixty yards away, like a large buoy. In fact, it was not a buoy, but a mine.</p>
<p>Flashes of light came from the destroyer's bridge. Ships only used flag signals in the past, but now they were using signal lamps to send dots and dashes, communicating with each other. Strangely, they could not be seen from a distance in the daylight. The ships behind us had to stay away from the destroyer and the lone mine. The destroyer pitched and rolled in the rolling waves, two hundred yards away from the mine.</p>
<p>After each ship passed, there was only a burst of machine gun fire, and then nothing was heard.</p>
<p>A large cannonball could destroy the mine. The destroyer did not want to waste cannonballs on drifting mines, so it used machine guns instead. The bullets pierced the outer shell of the mine, the seawater entered, and it sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>We were very lucky that the night we reached the British coast was very dark. We passed through the prohibited zone of Rathslin Island, only one mile from Ireland, and the weary ships were very fortunate to pass through the strait.</p>
<p>We were very careful because although this was British territorial waters, it was covered with both British and German mines. Even hitting a small mine would be terrible because the ship was full of explosives!</p>
<p>In the distance to the right, a searchlight suddenly shone into the dark sky. We were near Belfast and just happened to encounter an air raid. The calm air in the darkness carried the faint drone of German aircraft. Because of the distance, the heavy sound of artillery was almost inaudible. The sound of the aircraft engines grew louder, and they were getting closer and closer, but the darkness covered us, and they unknowingly missed this batch of spoils.</p>
<p>The ocean is like a forest, but the mines buried under the surface and the lurking submarines are more terrifying than poisonous snakes and beasts. (The End)</p>

<h3>Reuters Military Observer Discusses the Current Situation of the World War; While the Center of Attention Remains in the Soviet Union, Germany and Japan Can Act Elsewhere at Any Time; Britain Should Quickly Launch a Decisive Blow</h3>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – A Reuters military commentator said that the center of general concern remains in the Soviet Union, but other aspects must also be paid attention to and acted upon soon to deal with them. The Nazi threats to Turkey and Spain are still possible, and we in the Pacific are on the verge of a break with Japan. How Japan can avoid war with the United States is also difficult to predict. Hitler is now putting great pressure on the Vichy people under his wing to forcibly occupy ports and air bases on the northwest coast. Therefore, we must be prepared to act in any or all of these areas. This will certainly require more use of our resources to cope with it, but this is not beyond our capabilities. Fortunately, we have been preparing and have a large reserve force to deal with various emergencies. Regarding the Soviet front, the Germans are now claiming great victories, but according to the facts we know, there is no evidence to support what the Germans are saying. The German army in the north, together with the Finnish army, is still struggling on the northwest shore of Lake Ladoga and has not yet reached the eastern end of the lake. Although they want to peep at Leningrad, they have made no progress. The Germans claim to have occupied Kholm, but this is quite doubtful and, at present, does not pose a serious threat to the Soviet position. The Germans also claim that the Battle of Smolensk has ended, but the road to Moscow seems to be tightly closed. From the phenomenon, the fighting on this road is about to resume, and it will be the Soviet army, taking the initiative and launching an attack, that will open this road. The success of Moscow's air defense is also a cause of anxiety for the Germans, which proves the authority of the Soviet Air Force. The great reserves of Soviet troops and aircraft have not yet been fully used on the battlefield. In addition to exhausted troops, the Germans do not seem to have elite troops to meet the future Soviet offensive. However, although the future of the Soviet-German army is not optimistic, Germany can still take new adventures in northwest Africa, while simultaneously crossing Spain with five or six divisions to encircle Gibraltar, in order to establish a shorter transportation line with Morocco and Dakar. If Germany succeeds in this area, it can be in a favorable position in the war against Britain in the Atlantic and also become a real threat to the entire Americas. The United States cannot sit idly by and not rise up to resist this German action. From a military standpoint, it is essential to launch a rapid attack before Germany and its Vichy friends can consolidate their position in Dakar. We are currently showing activity in Tobruk and the Mediterranean. Germany seems to have withdrawn some of its air force and several divisions of its army from Libya. It is now urgent for Britain to launch a decisive blow. If the enemy is cleared from North Africa, and our naval and air forces can occupy the North African coast, reaching Tripoli, then not only will the naval position in the Mediterranean be strengthened, but our air force will also have a greater advantage, and the Middle East Allied forces will be able to provide support to Turkey when Germany attacks Turkey.</p>
<h3>In the North African War, Britain Gains the Initiative; The Threat to Invade Egypt Has Been Completely Eliminated; Italian Troops in Abyssinia Will Be Cleared Out</h3>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Responsible sources claim that the initiative in the western desert battlefield has now completely shifted to the British army. The Axis powers, instead of threatening to invade Egypt, are now worried about the possibility of the British army invading Libya, Sicily, and the Greek islands. It is heard that the British army has recently taken the offensive on the Sollum front, destroying many German armored vehicles, preventing the German army on that line from attacking in the short term. The British army in Tobruk is still holding out. The British army's invasion of Syria has finally broken Hitler's entire plan for the Middle East. The Italian troops still resisting in East Africa are now only holding out in Gondar and another besieged area. It is estimated that there are still 3,000 Italian soldiers and 6,000 native soldiers in the Gondar area. Therefore, the British army must leave some troops in East Africa to carry out the mop-up operation, but the enemy troops have been surrounded and are not receiving supplies, and will eventually surrender. Italian communiqués have exaggerated the British army's attack on the Tobruk salient. Responsible sources have refuted this, stating that although the enemy's casualties cannot be accurately estimated, they must be significant. The British army suffered 28 dead, 104 wounded, and 8 missing. After a fierce battle, the British army charged into the enemy's right-wing outpost. The enemy then used mortars and machine guns to bombard them, causing many casualties to both the enemy and the British army. At dusk, news came that the enemy's left-wing outpost had been occupied by the British army, defended by two officers and seventeen soldiers (eight of whom were seriously injured), and that eight German soldiers had been captured. The British side sent a large force of infantry to reinforce, but were blocked by heavy artillery fire. At the same time, the enemy counterattacked and recaptured the outpost.</p>
<p>Cairo, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Yesterday's British Air Force communiqué stated that on August 5, British and South African Air Force bombers continuously attacked ports and airfields held by the enemy in North Africa. Benghazi was attacked, and the breakwater was hit. Motor transport vehicles and cold storage warehouses at the Derna airfield were bombed and caught fire. Enemy airfields and barracks in Gazala and other places were also bombed and heavily damaged. On the same night, several enemy planes sneaked into Malta and dropped bombs. British fighter planes took off to intercept them, shooting down three enemy planes. On the same night, British naval air force planes attacked Augusta, the Italian submarine base on the island of Sicily, flying low and dropping heavy bombs, hitting the submarine mooring area, causing a huge fire. An hour later, another naval aircraft flew to the area and saw that the fire was still blazing. Only one British aircraft was lost in the attack.</p>
<h3>Funeral Held for Italian Premier's Second Son</h3>
<p>Rome, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – Officials stated that the funeral of Mussolini's son, Bruno, who died in a plane crash, will be held today in his hometown of Predappio.</p>
<p>Rome, Reuters dispatch, 8th – Yesterday morning, an Italian new aircraft crashed during a test flight near Pisa. Mussolini's son, Bruno, and two officers were killed, and five other officers were injured. After the accident, Mussolini and his eldest son, Vittorio, flew to Pisa and stayed for a short time in the mortuary of the Santa Chiara Hospital, before going to inspect the scene of the accident. The downed aircraft was a new four-engine bomber, belonging to a squadron that was being formed and would soon go into battle. Bruno was the commander of the squadron. Semi-official sources said that the cause of the accident was a mystery. The aircraft suddenly crashed at around 10:00 AM near the Sangesto flight port while preparing to land. The Italian King has telegraphed Mussolini his condolences. Bruno is survived by a wife and a daughter who is only eighteen months old.</p>
<h3>Battles in Various Parts of the Soviet Territory; No Major German Advances; Germans in Ukraine Are Advancing Southeast; Red Army Repels Six Attacks on Kiev</h3>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The latest Soviet war report stated that on August 7, Soviet troops fought resolutely with the enemy in the Kexholm, Kholm, Smolensk, and Velikiye Luki areas. No major battles occurred in other areas of the front. The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, continued to strike at enemy mechanized forces and infantry on the battlefield and enemy aircraft at airfields, shooting down 37 enemy aircraft. The Soviets also lost 19 aircraft. On August 6, enemy aircraft raided Moscow at night and nine were shot down. The previous report of six was inaccurate.</p>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – According to sources here, the German invasion of the Soviet Union has been contained, and progress everywhere is very slow. Although they still maintain the initiative, the German High Command is undoubtedly disappointed with the slow progress of the troops and the heavy casualties. The latest news is that there are no major changes in the Soviet war situation, and the German troops in the Smolensk area are almost static. In Ukraine, the German troops are advancing southeast. If they achieve a major victory, or can seize the Caucasus, then Britain's position in the Middle East will be threatened.</p>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The German radio station broadcast a special communiqué from the German High Command last night, stating that the annihilation war against the well-equipped Soviet army has not ended and a new stage of the war is now underway, indicating that the heavily troubled Soviet army still has strong resistance.</p>
<p>London, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – Authoritative sources said yesterday that the Red Army has repelled six German attacks on Kiev and has forced the Germans to move south in an attempt to flank Kiev. It is heard that General Kleist's tanks had formed a wedge in Zhitomir and approached Kiev, but were driven back by Soviet mechanized units and formidable flat-trajectory guns.</p>
<h3>Nazis Stabilize Domestic Morale by Distorting News of Frontline War Victories</h3>
<p>Moscow, Reuters dispatch, 8th – A statement released here today said that in order to boost morale and comfort the public, the Nazis have distorted the progress of the war in the Soviet Union. To this end, the German High Command released a horrifying account of the situation in the Eastern War on August 6. In order to cover up the severity of German losses, German propaganda referred to approaching the heavily fortified Stalin Line. The Soviet government certainly built defensive works in necessary locations, but there are no such lines in the areas where the two armies are currently fighting. In fact, the heavy losses suffered by the German army were not caused by special defense lines, but by the Soviet military and civilians defending their homeland with great courage, turning every inch of land into a stronghold of defense. The number of prisoners of war claimed by the German High Command are actually Soviet men and women civilians, forced by the German army to perform hard labor and driven behind the lines, and then referred to as prisoners of war. In the past six weeks of fighting, the German army has suffered more than 1.5 million casualties. The Red Army has captured or destroyed more than 8,000 German guns, losing 7,000 of its own. The Germans have lost more than 6,000 aircraft, and the Soviets have lost 4,000.</p>
<p>London, Reuters dispatch, 8th – The Nazi offensive on the Eastern Front has been blocked in most places due to the strong resistance of the Red Army. Berlin was forced last night to retract the exaggerated victory news recently published by German newspapers. At the same time, Moscow announced that Soviet troops continued to fight in the Kexholm, Smolensk, Belaya Tserkov, and Estonian areas. There were no major battles in other areas. Today, the opinion in London is that the German offensive against Odessa on the Black Sea and the advance along the south bank of the Dnieper River have become quite serious matters. There are reports that the railway line between Kiev and Odessa has been cut off. The continued advance of the German troops may isolate the Soviet troops in Odessa. According to Moscow, 39 German aircraft were shot down yesterday, and the Soviets lost 19 aircraft. There were no air raids on Moscow last night.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Führer, Huitong News Agency dispatch, 8th – This morning's official communiqué stated that many Soviet troops in Ukraine, surrounded southeast of Uman, are now being annihilated by the German army. 30,000 prisoners were captured, and the commander of the Soviet Sixth Army was also captured alive. The German army seized countless military supplies.</p>
<h3>Soviet Baltic Fleet Occupies Two Islands Near Hanko Island</h3>
<p>Moscow, Associated Press dispatch, 8th – The Baltic Fleet telegraphed yesterday that the Soviet Union had occupied two islands near Hanko Island. The telegram stated that Soviet marines landed on the island from patrol boats, attacking from three sides, subduing the defenders and capturing several enemies. The marines also occupied another island. It was recently heard from TASS that a submarine of the Soviet Northern Fleet had entered a Nazi harbor and destroyed a 6,000-ton transport ship with two torpedoes. The submarine returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>The US and USSR's Effective Cooperation Establishes a Considerable Foundation; Four US Oil Tankers to be Used by the Soviet Union; British Munitions to be Shipped to the USSR via Iran</h3>
<p>Moscow, August 8th, United Press International - "Pravda" stated yesterday that effective cooperation between the US and the USSR has established a considerable foundation. This cooperation is for mutual assistance in resisting and destroying the common enemies that threaten "the security and freedom of all nations." "Pravda" also claimed that Germany currently lacks the power to conquer the United States. The newspaper presented evidence of the Nazis' planned attack on the US and stated that Germany was striving to acquire a base in France in preparation for an invasion of the United States. Finally, it stated, "Hitler's threat endangers the entire world."</p>
<p>Washington, August 8th, United Press International - Interior Secretary Ickes stated yesterday that US aviation gasoline will be transported to the Soviet Union using four US oil tankers. Additional barreled aviation oil will be shipped by Soviet merchant vessels. Ickes predicted that the United States might also face a gasoline shortage unless production is increased or imports from other friendly nations are used for military purposes. Ickes stated that these four oil tankers would be fine-tuned on the West Coast. He added that the Soviet Union had requested a substantial quantity of oil, an amount that government experts had not anticipated when estimating US production needs.</p>
<p>Vichy, August 7th, Havas - Political observers here generally believe that the Near East is one of the most important regions at present. They stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden recently issued a statement saying that Britain was prepared to defend the countries between India and the Suez Canal. This statement has apparently been approved by the United States. The first task of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in India, is likely to be in this area. Based on the recent clarification of its position by the Iranian government, it is clear that Britain has begun efforts in this direction. Its first goal seems to be to find a way to transport British ordnance to the Soviet Union via the Iranian national railway after it lands in the Persian Gulf. If this plan becomes a reality, Turkey's situation will be quite difficult, and Turkey will no longer be outside the war zone at that time. It is said that members of the Turkish People's Party recently held a secret meeting to discuss this. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu gave a speech at the meeting, clarifying that the Turkish government would continue to adhere to its policy of neutrality and would not engage in war unless directly attacked.</p>
<h3>Border Conflicts Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Japanese Side Claims Insufficient Importance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 8th, Reuters - Japanese sources say that officials stated today that rumors that Japan has made demands on Moscow are purely groundless. The Japanese government can also make the same statement as Soviet Foreign Minister Lozovsky, who said yesterday that there have been no changes in Japanese-Soviet relations since the signing of the neutrality pact. As for the clashes between Soviet and Japanese troops on the Siberian border, these are not worth emphasizing. Even if any border conflicts occur, the worst would be accidental clashes between scouting parties and have no political significance. The reason for this is that there is no clear border between northern Manchuria and Soviet territory. Since the Joint Boundary Commission made a decision in Chita on June 16, the work of demarcation has been underway. Japanese newspapers have not recently reported any border clashes.</p>
<h3>British Women and Children in Saigon Scheduled to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Saigon, August 8th, Reuters - Although the British Consulate has not issued an order for the evacuation of British citizens, the women and children among the British expatriates here are scheduled to leave for Singapore on Sunday. The number of Japanese troops passing through Saigon has decreased slightly, and it is expected that the Japanese troops will change to using waterways and depart from the mouth of the Mekong River. French government offices are now suddenly painting large white crosses on their roofs, reportedly done on orders from the Vichy government, to ensure the safety of French property in the event of armed conflict in the Far East. This move can be seen as a sign that the French will not participate in the war.</p>
<h3>US Reinforcements Arrive in Iceland</h3>
<p>Reykjavik, Iceland, August 8th, United Press International - Officials recently stated that a US air fleet recently arrived here, bringing with it some US reinforcements.</p>
<h3>Tagore's Death; Mourned by All Circles in Britain</h3>
<p>London, August 8th, Reuters - All circles in Britain have expressed their sorrow upon hearing the news of the death of Indian poet and philosopher Tagore. Tagore passed away at the age of 80. He had been publishing his articles in newspapers since the age of 24. British scholars of literature and philosophy all admired him as a leader of contemporary thought. In 1913, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first Indian to receive this honor. Tagore lectured in England, America, Germany, and various countries in the Far East, and was welcomed everywhere. In October 1937, when Japan invaded China, Tagore vehemently condemned its barbarity and strongly criticized Japan's bombing of Chinese civilians. The Tagore Society of London recently received his last article, which stated, "Western humanity has failed to maintain the value of human civilization and dignity it has created over thousands of years, which frightens me. This is all because humanity does not guide national affairs with moral values and believes that everything is determined by violence. The first test of this evil belief began in Manchuria." London circles are scheduled to hold a memorial service next week, at which celebrities such as George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Aldous Huxley will deliver speeches.</p>
<h3>Luce, a Leading Figure in the US Publishing Industry, Returns; Notes from a Visit to Chongqing (5)</h3>
<p>At 5:10 AM, we arrived at the foot of a yellow hill, got out of the car, and covered it with tarpaulin. (The countryside here is all yellow earth—dusty like powder, perhaps the oldest soil in the world). The air was clean and cool. A family was working on the threshing ground of a farmhouse. We walked around the farmhouse on a small path and saw a larger parade ground than the threshing ground. A team of soldiers lined up, standing at attention. Military music was playing, and the officers were saluting—but not saluting their commander-in-chief. They were paying their respects to the Republic of China flag flying in the morning light on the distant mountain peak in front of them! The troops then marched forward at a run. What we saw that morning was most of the troops here. The 12,000 men under the command of this small village headquarters were scattered six miles north of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>After the flag was raised and the soldiers dispersed, he led us to a reception room in a mud house. Tea and biscuits were placed on a large table, and the hospitality was very attentive. In this small room, General Zhou issued several orders, and one or two officers came in and out, moving quickly and with strict discipline. General Zhou took out several very clear maps, but they were all drawn on inferior paper. All these maps were shown to us, indicating the positions occupied by his troops on the vast Chinese front.</p>
<p>After refreshments, the general said we could go around the village to take a look. It was a very touching place. At short intervals, there were deep valleys between the eroded walls of yellow earth, each valley capable of garrisoning a company of soldiers. We inspected a valley barracks in detail. The ground in the valley was paved with dust, but there was no trace of dust. There was a plot of land where vegetables could be grown, and something was planted in the ground. Several soldiers were working in the garden. Trees were planted along the street. The general led us all the way from the slope to the toilet. He was very proud; he made sure you couldn't see them; this was a kind of strategy; covering everything with lime or mud. We ran into caves, each cave capable of sleeping fifteen soldiers. There was a table and a bookcase in the cave, with about a hundred books in it. In front of the cave, fifty soldiers were listening attentively to a lecture on political science. He also took us to see a row of mud houses in the village, which the soldiers had newly built for the farmers. He said, "We build houses for the farmers, but they must keep them clean." Of course, it was very clean that morning! He said it was the cleanest thing in China.</p>
<p>At one end of the village, a small team of cavalry gathered. Our group rode Mongolian warhorses—horses so small that it was the first time I had seen them. We rode in single file through the village, the general leading the way. But just as we were about to set off, my wife's horse suddenly bolted into the field, causing her to lose her camera case. We set off on the road to Tongguan, a walled town on the Yellow River. The six or seven-mile journey was mixed with a lot of traffic—donkeys and wheelbarrows—all transporting military supplies for the various armies. We ran into two or three large villages, and there were many people in the villages. The food stores had food piled high. There were vegetable gardens in the valleys between the villages here.</p>
<p>We immediately saw the Yellow River, and we didn't see it again until we were inside the walls of Tongguan. There were mountain ridges at both ends of the city wall, just like the Great Wall. We dismounted at the city gate, which clearly surprised General Zhou's subordinates. He led us through winding alleys to the railway embankment. From there, we looked across the river to the high mountains on the Japanese side. This place was 2,000 meters away from the Japanese artillery. We could see piles of rubble on the embankment, but vehicles still traveled back and forth through the tunnel, directly to Tongguan.</p>
<p>General Zhou led us through the city, which was full of posters. Several acres of land that used to have mud houses were now in ruins. Later, we walked to the city wall near the Yellow River and the Japanese side. Inside the city wall, we met the regimental commander stationed in front and led us to his headquarters. He had built a flower garden in the pile of rubble. The regimental commander led us into an air-raid shelter and invited us to drink tea at a dining table. Fresh flowers were placed on the table and the tables next to it. Then we climbed the city wall from inside the city. When we reached the top, General Zhou told us not to stick our heads out beyond the battlements to prevent the Japanese from seeing us. There were 800 yards between the river and the city wall, and it was at least 1,000 yards to cross the river. We could see the winding trenches of the 16th Army and the location of the machine gun squads.</p>
<p>We walked out of the wide city gate and immediately stepped into the trenches. We walked a little further and met two machine gun squads. The soldiers were all reading books. We stopped to look at the contents of the books, which were mostly elementary readers, starting with an explanation that every good soldier should read. Finally, we had reached the outpost. A few meters ahead was the Yellow River, which formed a large arc here, the famous Ordos Loop.</p>
<p>That was it. The Yellow River flowed on, very calm that day. We went back through Tongguan. On the outskirts of the city, our car miraculously waited there for us and ran a few more miles to see a large artillery position in the village. The gunners were doing their routine work, looking very energetic.</p>
<p>General Zhou and another adjutant rode their horses behind us, and we drove ahead. On the country roads, they could catch up with the car and run alongside us. We let the horses go first to avoid the dust raised by the car. There was a small path between two wheat fields that diverged from the road. The general gave us a final farewell and turned his horse onto the path—back to headquarters. We last saw the short and sturdy General Zhou sitting on a Mongolian warhorse, heading forward for the victory of China (End).</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Food Establishes a Plan to Solve the People's Food Problem; Implementing Production, Consumption, and Storage Plans; Issuing Food Storage Vouchers to Tenant Farmers</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese operations have entered their fifth year. China's rice may be insufficient to meet wartime needs, or at least it is extremely difficult to circulate all the rice. Several vital transportation lines have been cut off by the Japanese army. To cope with this problem, the Chinese government has specially decided to establish a Ministry of Food to handle this most important problem in China. The problems that the ministry wants to solve are extremely complex, including the following: (1) There are no reliable statistics on production, consumption, or storage; (2) China's pre-war</p>
<p>Food imports have been cut off; (3) The Yangtze River area up to Yichang is controlled by Japan, and the supply and demand between provinces cannot be mutually adjusted; (4) The devaluation of currency and the relative lack of rice have made rice a target for hoarding and speculation, especially among tenant farmers who receive grain as rent; (5) The government must purchase huge amounts of rice to feed its large army and issue rice subsidies to government employees and low-level officials to supplement their meager wartime salaries. In the two years of 1938 and 1939,</p>
<p>There was a bumper harvest of grains, so the problem was not urgent. But last year's harvest was poor, and this year's hopes are only average, so the problem has gradually become serious. The main attention is now focused on fertile Sichuan, which is the core of China's wartime economy in the un-occupied areas. Therefore, the government appointed Xu Kan as Minister of Food. Xu is a Sichuan native who has served as Director of the Finance Department for many years. When Xu met with a United Press International reporter, he outlined the Ministry of Food's plan to deal with this problem. He stated that the following will</p>
<p>Be implemented: (1) The Ministry of Food will try to facilitate transportation in areas that produce surplus food; (2) It will try to deal with hoarders and speculators and prohibit the wasteful use of grains, such as using them to make wine; (3) The government will teach the public to use other flour foods besides rice, such as wheat, barley, sweet potatoes, and beans; (4) The government will try to purchase all surplus grain (presumably meaning the grain left over after farmers have eaten and kept seed). In this regard, the Ministry of Food plans to encourage the construction of public and</p>
<p>Government warehouses throughout the country to store surplus grain, so as to feed the army and government civil servants. When the market price of food in any area tends to rise sharply, the government can also sell it at a low price to control prices. The authorities estimate that after the implementation of grain tax collection this year, Sichuan alone can collect 6 million piculs of grain (660 million pounds). Food bonds can also obtain the same amount in this province alone. These bonds will be redeemed in equal installments over five years starting in 1943,</p>
<p>And will be paid with the grain obtained from the land tax. Minister Xu frankly admitted that he will encounter difficulties, especially in obtaining surplus grain held by landlords and merchants. They have always been unwilling to sell surplus grain to the government at the prices set by the government, because the prices set by the government are lower than the high prices in the market. However, the two new measures recently promulgated by the government may greatly overcome these difficulties. One is to set the land tax in grain, and the other is to issue</p>
<p>Food bonds, with the government borrowing grain from grain owners, issuing bonds, and promising to repay the grain together with interest in two years. Minister Xu emphasized that the government has established a long-term plan based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's agricultural plan for China. The first point is to liberate tenant farmers. Xu pointed out that although China does not have large landlords with huge wealth like those in Tsarist Russia, there are still</p>
<p>"Middle-class" landlords who collect most of the tenant farmers' produce as rent. For example, in the Chengdu area, tenant farmers must pay 73% of their harvest to the landlords. Xu also stated that since the start of the war, the income of landlords has increased tenfold to twentyfold, resulting in higher rice prices. As a result, what the tenant farmers earn is not enough to make a living. This is the worst impact on China's rural economy and production. The basic program of the Kuomintang should be that those who cultivate the land should own it, but this ideal should be realized step by step. The second part of the government's plan is to adopt modern scientific farming methods to increase agricultural production. The third point is to control surplus grain,</p>
<p>Control distribution, save consumption, and improve transportation. This great plan is now beginning to be implemented concretely. When the order for food bonds was announced, the Chongqing National Public Daily published a commentary, stating that the prestige of the National Government depends on the success of the first resolution to issue food bonds. The newspaper stated, "If there is any corruption in handling this matter, the entire plan will fail. If this plan is implemented properly, it can suppress food prices, ensure that people have enough to eat, and stabilize the currency as a result." (August 8th, United Press International)</p>
<h3>The American Red Cross Continues to Purchase Medicines, Which Will Be Shipped to China Soon; The Medicines are Worth a Total of One Million Dollars; Anti-Malaria Pills Will Be Shipped to Chongqing by Airplane</h3>
<p>Washington - Air News - Davis, President of the American Red Cross, stated that the American Red Cross is currently continuing to purchase $1 million worth of medicines to supply to Free China, which will be delivered in the fastest way to meet the urgent needs of the inland provinces and to curb the rampant malaria between the Burmese border and Chongqing.

The amount of money used by the American Red Cross for relief work in China has exceeded US$3.5 million. (Reported on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Revenue Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Gao Bingfang, Director of the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, said that China's direct tax revenue has grown during the war and is now on the right track. The profit tax for this year has exceeded one-third of the income tax so far and is expected to double by the end of the year. According to the Sichuan-Kang Direct Tax Department, the income tax budget for the Sichuan-Kang region this year is 65 million yuan, and the actual revenue for the first half of the year was more than 30 million yuan.

<h3>Sports News Charity Basketball and Volleyball Tournament Opens Today, Three Exciting Programs for Men and Women, Men's Basketball Qianghua vs. All-Black Shanghai Stars vs. Blue and White Interlude Women's Volleyball Buyouxing First Battle with Shanghai Stars</h3>
<p>The charity men's and women's basketball and volleyball tournament hosted by the Disaster Relief Children's Education Center is scheduled to open at 5:00 PM today at Guoqiang Middle School on Avenue Petain. There will be two men's basketball games and one women's volleyball game. The first game is men's basketball Shanghai Stars vs. Blue and White. The former boasts fierce generals such as Chen Xuechong, Yu Xunzi, Liang Yunming, and Zhuo Guorong. The latter has been battling on the field for a long time. Li Zude, Qiu Xiaoci, Chen Bangzhen, etc., are all well-known in the Shanghai basketball scene, and Bao Songyuan's ball skills are even more improving rapidly. Therefore, the whole army's lineup is extremely strong. With tigers competing, there should be a fierce battle. The second game is the women's volleyball first final. Shanghai Stars meets Buyouxing for the first time. The Western team is one of the two giants in Shanghai women's volleyball, one being the champion of the Youth Invitational Volleyball Women's Group, and the other being the leader of the Western Youth Women's Volleyball League. Their strength can be said to be comparable. The three-game two-win system is adopted to determine the leader of the isolated island women's volleyball league. The finale is men's basketball Qianghua vs. All-Black. Qianghua has fierce generals like clouds, such as Chen Xianglong, Feng Nianhua, and Lu Zhongen, all brave and good at fighting. All-Black then has veteran players Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, and Xu Jusheng. Their strength is no less than Qianghua's. In a dragon and tiger fight, it is impossible to predict who will win. At the opening of today's first game, Ms. Li Qiujun, the host of the Disaster Relief Children's Education Center, will perform the opening ball ceremony, and Lei Shude, the St. Francis Boy Scout coach, will lead the school's boy scouts to maintain order. In addition, one basketball and one volleyball used in the basketball and volleyball games will be auctioned during the break. The balls have autographs of male and female players and inscriptions by Ms. Li. Ms. Li is a famous contemporary painter and calligrapher, making them even more valuable. If it rains today, the event will be postponed to tomorrow. Tickets are divided into two types: two yuan and five yuan. The income will be announced on the same day to show trustworthiness. The order is recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Study Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Study Botany (I)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shanzheng</p>
<p>What is Botany?</p>
<p>Plants are collectively called organisms, and together with animals and minerals, they are called natural history. We take plants as the object, use scientific methods to study their morphology, physiology, ecology, and relationship with humans, which is called botany. Because the phenomena in the plant kingdom are very complex, for the convenience of research, it is divided into pure botany and applied botany. Pure botany is further divided into plant morphology (including external morphology, anatomy, cytology, etc.), plant taxonomy, plant physiology, plant ecology, plant distribution, paleobotany, etc. Applied botany is further divided into agricultural botany, industrial botany, forestry, medicinal botany, etc.</p>
<p>(II) Why Study Botany? First, all the food in the world is made from green plants. Food is the substance that creates the body of organisms and provides the energy for work. If there were no green plants in the world, all animals would not be able to survive, and humans would not be able to maintain their lives. We sometimes hear about wind disasters, floods, and droughts in certain places, and we worry about them very much. Now, because unscrupulous merchants hoard rice, our lives are extremely difficult. Isn't this because plants have a close relationship with human life?</p>
<p>Second, the raw materials for clothing, except for silk and wool fabrics made from animals, but ordinary clothing materials are made from plant (cotton and hemp) fibers. Without clothing, the body cannot be protected.</p>
<p>Third, the raw materials for building houses, except for tall Western-style houses, ordinary houses are made from plants. As for indoor appliances, as well as wall coverings and floors, all are made from plants.</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of transportation, boats, vehicles, and railway sleepers all need to be made from plants.</p>
<p>Fifth, in terms of medicines for treating diseases, 70 to 80% of traditional Chinese medicine is plants, and quinine, angelica, and ephedrine in Western medicine are also extracted from plants. Now people in the East and West are studying our country's medicines, and the amount exported to foreign countries every year is very large. In this situation, the value of plants in medicine can be imagined. Sixth, in front of the courtyard flower beds, planting flowers for viewing, and decorating the scenery in barren mountains and wilderness, plants are the main source.</p>
<p>Seventh, bacteria are a kind of extremely small plant, which is both beneficial and harmful to humans. It is appropriate to study the methods of eliminating and utilizing them to increase the radiation of mankind.</p>
<p>Eighth, our country is based on agriculture, but farmers have no scientific knowledge, adhere to the old ways, and do not know how to improve, resulting in insufficient yields, which is very regrettable. To seek improvement in order to seek the happiness of mankind, we must study botany.</p>
<p>Ninth, many raw materials for industry are taken from plants. If we want to revitalize industry, we must first have sufficient plants that are beneficial to industry.</p>
<p>Tenth, studying various plants, comparing differences, classifying them in an orderly manner, is truly a good material for training humans to know how to use scientific methods.</p>

<h3>Fierce Hurricane Hits Shanghai Yesterday The City in a Rainstorm Tidal Water Inverted Roads All Become Swamps Shipping Interrupted Vehicles Partially Stopped</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a storm came with the lunar autumn, and the city was once again in a state of chaos. According to the report of the Xujiahui Observatory, a hurricane originating from the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean, at a rate of ten miles per hour, passed through the ocean surface of Da Jijishan, one hundred and twenty nautical miles away from here, last night to this morning, and entered the eastern part of Shanghai to the north. The strong winds and rain throughout yesterday were due to the passage of the hurricane's wing, bringing low air pressure. In addition, yesterday coincided with the full moon high tide, and the water inverted. Public vehicles were stopped and entered the factory due to water accumulation on the roads. In terms of shipping, according to the customs warning, it was temporarily interrupted. Fortunately, the center of the wind did not pass through Shanghai, otherwise the harm would have been much greater than this.</p>
<p>Hurricane Invasion Customs Warning</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs received a report from the observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, saying that the hurricane had invaded to 29 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, and the wind was heading northwest. The city was under attack. Upon receiving the report, the customs immediately hoisted a black cross signal on the roof of the clock tower at 7:30 AM, warning ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. At noon, the customs received another report from the observatory that the hurricane had reached 30 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, and the wind head had reached the city. At 2:00 PM, the customs received another report that the hurricane had reached 30 degrees 00 north latitude and 122 degrees 50 east longitude.</p>
<p>At 11:00 PM last night, this newspaper inquired from the Xujiahui Observatory and learned that the hurricane was hovering between 31 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, with a speed between 11.2 miles. Observing this position, the hurricane has swept past Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shipping Interrupted Transportation Blocked</p>
<p>When the customs hoisted the signal warning yesterday morning, traffic on both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River was cut off, and ferries were completely suspended. Only the company's own small boats were still running at risk. All barges and rowing boats were heading to Suzhou Creek for temporary shelter. Yesterday, 11 ships arrived at the port before 10:30 AM, except for the large ship Hualun Yang Kaili (transliteration) transporting coal from the Pailun Islands (Dutch), the rest were small boats running in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. There were no ships for export all day. The Dutch ship Zhibade and Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship, which were scheduled to export, stopped their anchor and will set off after the hurricane passes. The new Beijing ship of Taikoo Company's Beiyang class, which was supposed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, also did not arrive due to the hurricane.</p>
<p>High Tide Heavy Rain Water Accumulation into Ditches</p>
<p>At noon yesterday, the wind became tighter and tighter, and heavy rain suddenly fell. It was also the full moon high tide. When the tide of the Huangpu River rose, it looked like ten thousand horses galloping, the river was turbulent, and it poured into the road surface all day long, and did not recede. Low-lying areas all became swamps. Zhejiang Road, Sichuan Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Jing'an Temple, Yuyuan Road, Daxilu Road, Difeng Road, and Yidingpan Road in the Public Concession were all flooded with water above the knees. The middle section of Avenue Joffre, Malong Road, Route Sayzoe, Route Paul Henry, and Route Cardinal Baudrillart in the French Concession were also flooded with one foot of water. Passersby walked barefoot and with legs exposed, wading through the water. The situation was extremely embarrassing, and rickshaw pullers were still shouting incessantly, demanding high prices, some as high as six or seven yuan. Other cars, etc., stalled on the street due to the machines being submerged in water, one after another, and the situation was very chaotic. According to this port, frequent floods are not only detrimental to sanitation, but also hinder transportation. The general public is complaining. Although the authorities of the two concessions intend to raise the road surface or improve the ditches, the project is huge and cannot be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>The Two Concessions Started Special Preparedness Last Night Police Officers Prohibited from Taking Leave During the Preparedness Period Non-Essential Roads Will Be Blocked</h3>
<p>The police and all defense forces in this port, including the US Marine Corps and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, started special preparedness last night (August 8) to prevent unexpected events during the fourth anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. It is reported that both concessions will strictly implement the curfew from midnight and strengthen prevention as usual until after August 14th. The police departments of both concessions have canceled police officers' leave during the preparedness period, and all police officers in the Public Concession will be fully equipped from yesterday noon and will be dispatched at any time until midnight on August 14th. Some roads in both concessions will be blocked, and strict defense and inspection will be carried out at the border with the Chinese area. All teams of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be on standby from Monday to assist the police in maintaining law and order. Chinese residents will commemorate it in a solemn and vigilant spirit due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>Public Vehicles Partially Stopped</p>
<p>Yesterday, the road surface was too deeply flooded, and public vehicles in the two concessions were almost stopped. The trams in the Public Concession were too dangerous to operate due to the tracks being buried in the water, so they were all stopped and returned to the factory. Although buses barely operated, they shortened the route and did not drive to the flooded area. Trolleybuses, on the other hand, operated as usual. Trams on routes 1, 2, 7, and 10 in the French Concession were also stopped one after another due to the deep water accumulation on Avenue Joffre. Other trolleybuses and buses, although they operated as usual, all returned to the factory early in the evening. If the wind subsides and the water recedes today, all vehicles on all routes can resume normal operation.</p>
<p>Storm Rampages Losses Repeatedly Seen</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rampage of the hurricane, many fences or billboards were blown down in the street. The main ones are as follows: (1) The outer bamboo fence of the six-story Wheelock Building, which was built on the original site of the Commodities Exchange at the intersection of Edward Road and Sichuan Road, was blown down by the hurricane at 1:30 PM yesterday. Fortunately, there were few passersby, and no tragedy occurred. However, the pole in Sichuan Road was broken, and the nearby Thames Building and Enterprise Building were cut off from electricity. It was not repaired and restored by the power company until 2:40 PM. (2) At 11:00 AM yesterday, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's billboard erected on the roof of Deng Zhongxing Hardware Store at the intersection of Henan Road and Edward Road was blown down by the wind, fortunately without injuring anyone, only crushing a rickshaw. (3) At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a cool shed at Lane 80 of Xieqiao Lane collapsed, without injuring anyone. (4) The large billboard in front of the Yunfei Car Factory at the intersection of Edward Road and Sichuan Road was blown down by the wind, without injuring anyone. (5) Many trees on the roadside in the French Concession were uprooted by the strong wind.</p>
<p>High Tides Continue This Morning and Afternoon</p>
<p>It is found that at 4:30 this morning, the Huangpu River will have another high tide, and its amount is predicted to be 12 feet 6 inches. At that time, the high tide will inevitably land, and the water disaster on the road will be more serious. It is also found that there will be an afternoon tide at 1:50 PM today, and the predicted amount is 10 feet 08 inches 5 points, which is also worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Chaff Oil Tanker Released by Japan</h3>
<p>Continental News reported that according to responsible parties, the Japanese Navy released the US Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Meiyao" that it had detained yesterday (July 7) and handed it over to the Jianghai Customs. It is not yet known whether this means that our country has no intention of confiscating the ship or the oil it carries. The Japanese authorities have not yet issued an official statement on this matter. According to the report, "Meiyao" was detained by the Japanese Navy on Monday because it was docked at a certain port on the Yangtze River, which did not match the place name stated in the customs declaration form.</p>
<h3>Supply of Foreign Exchange Outside the Concession Area Ministry of Finance Will Promulgate Measures From Now On, Foreign Exchange Transactions Will Be Concentrated in the Four Banks No One May Engage in Trading Without Special Approval</h3>
<p>After the US government issued a special note to the China, Communications, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China to safeguard China's legitimate foreign trade, the New Voice News reporter learned from the four banks and various Chinese commercial banks yesterday that the Ministry of Finance is formulating concrete measures regarding the import merchants in the Shanghai concession area who need to purchase foreign exchange for importing essential goods, and to safeguard legal trade. It is opened that in the future, foreign exchange transactions will be concentrated in the four banks, and Chinese commercial banks may not engage in foreign exchange business without special approval. Regarding the black market exchange rate in Shanghai, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is ordered to find ways to continue to maintain it, and the people are ordered to practice frugality. All luxury goods and non-essential goods should be saved and wasted for the purpose of national construction.</p>
<p>Temporary Measures of China and Communications Banks</p>
<p>The China and Communications Banks will legally supply legal foreign exchange to import merchants in the free area who are engaged in importing goods that are essential for the country. As for the Shanghai concession area, due to the special circumstances, foreign exchange will be legally supplied for the import of essential goods that are specially approved by the Chinese government. It is also decided that before the order of the Ministry of Finance is received, the import of goods into Shanghai, even if they are essential goods, will be temporarily suspended unless they are specially approved by the government. However, this does not apply to importers who have foreign exchange in the two banks. It is reported that non-essential goods that are prohibited from being imported by the government under 434 tariff numbers must not be requested from China and Communications for foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Chinese Commercial Banks Comply with Orders</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the 60th Note issued by the Central Bank to Chinese commercial banks engaged in foreign exchange, the Central Bank will collect and pay all foreign exchange bought and sold by Chinese merchants before July 26, so that the funds of Chinese commercial banks that have been frozen by the US government can be transferred by the Central Bank and become unfrozen funds, and the settlement must be completed before August 15. In the future, the foreign exchange business of various Chinese commercial banks will be handled in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance. Before the order of the Ministry is received, the foreign exchange business, except for those who have foreign exchange positions in Shanghai, must be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Allied Banks Continue to Supply</p>
<p>The measures for prohibiting imported goods and the measures for receiving foreign exchange differentials for exported goods previously promulgated by the Ministry of Finance have been ordered by the customs in the free area to be implemented. However, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has never complied with them due to environmental reasons. Luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported into Shanghai. It is reported that although these prohibited goods may not apply for foreign exchange from the China and Communications Banks, they can still be purchased from 14 allied banks such as HSBC as of now. Because the allied banks implement freezing, it is not thorough. Therefore, speculation by speculators has not disappeared, and the black market for foreign exchange is still free. The so-called strict review is only in name.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Continues to Be Maintained</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, after sending American member Fox to Shanghai for inspection, has decided on a method based on the findings of the inspection and will implement it step by step. Regarding the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, it is decided to continue to maintain it in accordance with the established policy of the Chinese government to maintain the legitimate trade of China and allied merchants. The maintenance method has also been agreed upon with allied banks such as Citibank and HSBC. The New Voice News reporter learned from the foreign exchange market yesterday that the black market was tight yesterday, which was actually caused by speculators taking advantage of the situation. It is reported that the Stabilization Fund will not only try its best to maintain it, but also try to prevent this improper fluctuation in order to stabilize the exchange market and maintain legitimate trade.</p>
<h3>Arrived in the Rain and Wind for Face-to-Face Talks, Given Boundless Sympathy, Demonstrating the Earnestness of Applying for Educational Assistance, and Brightness Must Come from Struggle</h3>
<p>The heavy rain and wind shook our hearts, deepened our apologies, and encouraged our spirit of service!</p>
<p>In order to investigate those applying for educational assistance, our colleagues sweated profusely under the scorching sun, fulfilling our duties. Yesterday, we were spared the sun's oppressive heat, but encountered a passing hurricane. The rain and wind seemed to remind us that struggle is essential in life's journey. In addition to personally visiting and investigating, we also sent letters to some applicants whose addresses were difficult to access, inviting them to the office for face-to-face talks. Yesterday, the sudden hurricane arrived, but our letters had already been sent out three days prior. We worried that the weaker students would be attacked by the storm on their way. We were sorry that we couldn't reschedule. After they finished their talks and left the office, our apology remained indelible, and our hearts remained uneasy. If the weather is still like this today, we can and should postpone the appointments for students from afar who have already been scheduled for interviews. On the one hand, we hope that all students can develop a spirit of perseverance, but on the other hand, we believe that it is appropriate to postpone appointments due to special transportation obstacles. We hope that the students who received the interview notices will take note.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are dark, but the rooster crows incessantly; now that we have seen the students, how can we not be delighted.</p>
<p>Yesterday, several students who were scheduled for interviews braved the difficult journey of wind that could not hold an umbrella and streets filled with water, and most of them walked to the office. Therefore, we have to change this ancient poem to "Now that we have seen the students, how can we not be delighted." We firmly believe that this spirit is the factor for your future success in life. We send you off with a mix of joy and guilt, entrusting you with the enthusiasm to wish you a safe journey home, and to preserve it forever.</p>
<p>Our colleagues also ventured out in the wind and rain yesterday to conduct investigations. This is the duty of our colleagues, and we do not want to talk about our investigation process yesterday, but we feel that there are many points worth noting about the students who came to the office yesterday. Sympathy, expectation, and comfort were swirling in our minds.</p>
<p>One thirteen-year-old student, whose father's life was taken in the war, lives with his mother in a small tea house, relying on his mother's knitting of gloves to make a living. They eat two meals of porridge and four large pancakes a day, hungry and unable to afford rice. They borrow tuition every semester, intending to pay it back, but are ultimately unable to do so.</p>
<p>Two siblings applying for educational assistance, whose father teaches at a junior high school, supports a family of ten, and educational expenses. All income is not enough to buy rice, but they firmly believe that without education, their children will have no way to make a living in the future. One twenty-year-old university student, whose father passed away and relies on his sister's service to support the family. He is an outstanding student, earnestly hoping to continue his studies. He solemnly said that the time for him to serve society is gradually approaching, and he will never forget the spirit of educational assistance from people in society.</p>
<p>Two young ladies studying obstetrics, one lost her father at the age of seven, and then her mother. Her younger siblings also died young. She is truly lonely and desolate. She held back her hot tears, gradually lowering her voice, but her spirit of not being decadent and not shrinking can be observed. One's father fled to Yichang after the war, and the whole family was scattered, with no news. She studied in Shanghai before the war, and now her classmates provide her with accommodation. She looks forward to the success of her studies, and at the same time hopes to find her father's whereabouts, which is equally eager.</p>
<p>For the investigation of educational assistance, let the brothers and sisters re-recall your difficult life journey. However, this should not cause your negative scars, but should be your positive encouragement. Hardship always helps those who succeed. Those who degenerate never come from hardship, nor do they know hardship. This is what colleagues want to encourage and comfort everyone. (N)</p>
<h3>High Tides and Heavy Rains Often Cause Flooding in Shanghai; Road Surfaces Sink Year by Year, Greatly Affecting the Situation; Fundamental Remediation Requires Approximately 200 Million Yuan; Speech by the Director of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council at the Rotary Club</h3>
<p>Gimson, Director of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, said in a speech at the weekly meeting of the Rotary Club at the Metropole Hotel the other day that Shanghai streets are prone to flooding for two main reasons: high tides twice a month and heavy rains. When heavy rain falls during high tide and the water level rises to the level of the roads, all the streets are easily flooded.</p>
<p>Shanghai Streets Sink Year by Year</p>
<p>Another reason is that the ground sinks by one-third of an inch to one inch, and the sinking is more severe in the western district than in the central district. The sinking of the road surface is estimated using special equipment. In addition, the rise and fall of the tide can be measured to determine the degree of sinking. Taking Cathay Mansion as an example, since the building was completed several years ago, the roads around it have sunk by about five feet.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek Has Not Been Dredged, Making it Difficult to Drain Floodwater</p>
<p>In order to remedy the flooding situation, 200 million yuan is required to purchase the necessary equipment and machinery. However, this plan cannot be proposed at present because the administrative organs of the two concessions are unable to raise this huge sum of money. Whenever there is heavy rain, water accumulates on the streets and drains slowly because the water level of the Suzhou Creek rises. Another cause of flooding is that the Suzhou Creek has not been dredged in the past four years, which has greatly hindered the drainage of floodwater.</p>
<p>Hurricanes Passing Through Shanghai Often Cause Flooding</p>
<p>When the hurricane passed through Shanghai in 1935, the streets were flooded, with depths reaching five feet. Sometimes the tide rose, and the water around the Bund and Henan Road area was three feet high, so the roads in this area need to be rebuilt, and one of the sewers should be blocked, allowing only the accumulated water to drain out and not flow in. Ordinary pump methods for draining water from houses have proven to be quite effective.</p>
<p>Prosperous Areas are Especially Difficult to Remedy</p>
<p>However, the roads around the major department stores on Nanjing Road pose a difficult problem. The traffic there is extremely congested, and the tram lines crisscross, making it impossible to raise the road surface, and the sewers cannot be blocked because they are connected to other parts, allowing the water to flow into the sewers. The western district is the most flooded because the authorities in that area did not allow the Public Works Department to work there in previous years. However, after the Shanghai War in 1937, the Public Works Department sent teams to raise the roads in that area.</p>
<h3>Soybean and Rice Industry Report: Rice Reserves are Sufficient, There is No Fear of Shortage</h3>
<p>The entire city's food reserves are still extremely abundant, and there is no fear of shortage in the future. The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association's 123rd survey of rice stocks in Chinese and foreign warehouses (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was officially completed yesterday. The total rice stocks in more than 80 rice and grain warehouses in the city reached 1,214,008 bags. The association has now submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions and seven rice industry groups for review as reference materials for evaluation. The warehouses with the most abundant rice stocks are listed below, including Gonghexiang 141,448 bags, Huashun 67,725 bags, Company 29,199 bags, Qichang and Little Jardine, totaling 29,492 bags, Old Jardine 60,521 bags, Roosevelt 69,981 bags, Jardine 56,712 bags, Heji 12,933 bags, Dinghe 26,796 bags, Xinyuan 38,926 bags, Hufeng 17,955 bags, Maotai 56,538 bags, Longmao 11,204 bags, Guotai 12,828 bags for two warehouses, Zikang 12,286 bags, Bank of China 84,270 bags, Xingye Bank 60,976 bags, Industrial Bank 27,375 bags, and the average of other warehouses is also around 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Lin Xiongji Appealed in Nagasaki</h3>
<p>Lin Xiongji, the former chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Taxpayers Association, was arrested and escorted back to Japan for shooting at the former Director-General of the Public Concession Works Bureau, Ke Ziwei, when a special meeting of taxpayers was held at the Racecourse. He was sentenced to two years in prison by the Nagasaki District Court for attempted murder and granted probation. Later, Lin's family members and others filed an appeal, believing that it was premeditated murder. According to the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao, Lin Xiongji's appeal case was heard at the Nagasaki Court of Appeal at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th of this month. Judge Shiraishi presided over the hearing, and lawyer Yasui Gengo defended him on his behalf. The court adjourned at 4:15 p.m.</p>
<p>The Iron Gates in Nanshi Were All Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition to opening the iron gates at Xin Kaihe and Nanyang Bridge, the iron gates at Xinqiao Street, Shiliupu, and Xieqiao in Nanshi were also opened at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. Therefore, all the iron gates leading to Nanshi have now been opened and restored to their original state. At the same time, the Japanese military police stationed in the refugee area have also withdrawn. It is said that when the Xin Kaihe iron gate had not yet been opened yesterday morning, a large number of women and children were waiting at the iron gate. The Japanese army inspected them in detail. At that time, a woman with a basket full of large pancakes and fried dough sticks, resembling a vendor, was suspected of something and was arrested and taken away by the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ships Are Still Detained in Dinghai</h3>
<p>In March of this year, the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang flourished for a time. More than a dozen merchant ships from Germany and Italy competed to sail this route. However, after the Japanese Navy expanded the blockade area in the Zhejiang East Sea, six ships, including the Moufu, Anmanli, and Baolichangde, were detained by the Japanese side in the waters near Dinghai. Except for the Baolichangde, which was escorted back to Shanghai by a Japanese warship, the other four ships, such as the Anmanli and Moufu, are still being detained in the waters of Dinghai. Although the shipping companies have repeatedly requested the consulate to negotiate for their release, it has been four months and there has been no satisfactory result. As for the Baolichangde, which was detained in the Yangshupu River in this city, it was rumored that there was a possibility of release, but this has not been realized so far.</p>
<h3>Strikes Broke Out in Wanhe and Yusheng Rice Shops; Mei Ya No. 9 Factory Also Goes on Slowdown</h3>
<p>The labor-capital dispute in the rice shop industry in this city has been resolved for more than a month. Since last month, the rice shops have been fulfilling the agreed terms. However, some minority rice shops have still firmly refused to fulfill them, which has led to another strike. According to a reporter from Dagang News Agency, all the employees of Wanhe Rice Shop at No. 6 Caishi Road and Yusheng Rice Shop at No. 48 on the same road in the French Concession left the shop on the night of the 3rd of this month due to the delay of the capitalists in fulfilling the agreed terms and went on strike again. They also sent a telegram to the capitalists requesting immediate fulfillment of the agreed terms. The situation was still deadlocked as of yesterday. It is learned that the capitalists will send representatives to negotiate with the labor side today. In addition, hundreds of male and female workers in the No. 9 branch of the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 1001 Xujiahui Road in this city have been on a slowdown since the day before yesterday because their request for the capitalists to improve their treatment was not met. It is learned that the labor side has petitioned the capitalists several times yesterday, requesting sincere negotiations. However, the capitalists ignored them. The labor side will request the French Concession authorities to mediate so that the labor unrest can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Consulate General Stipulates Visa Procedures for Chinese People Traveling to the United States; Holders of Official Passports Must Be Approved; Business Travelers, Tourists, and Students Should Have Guarantees</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General, in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. government, implemented new visa regulations for traveling to the United States on July 1 in order to adapt to the emergency situation. A reporter from the New Agency inquired with the U.S. Consulate General about the visa procedures for Chinese people as follows: (1) Holders of official passports can be issued visas by U.S. consulates in various places after being approved by Washington; (2) Those who travel to or do business in the United States must have guarantees from two guarantors in the place of departure, and then the U.S. Consulate General will review them and then send a telegram to Washington to request approval; (3) Students must have two guarantors residing in the United States to provide guarantees before they can apply for a visa. The guarantors must be U.S. citizens or foreigners who are legally permitted to reside permanently in the United States.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the heavy wind and rain all day, the roads were flooded and difficult to walk on. However, many people who sympathized with the educational assistance fund of this newspaper still sent donations in the rain, and their kindness is admirable. From morning to night yesterday, 25 students were invited to the office for interviews. They did not flinch because of the wind and rain, which increased their spirit of moving forward. They were full of vigor, respectable and lovable. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Xingye Colleagues Launched Educational Assistance</p>
<p>Since the colleagues of a major bank generously donated 1,000 yuan on the 2nd of this month, it has aroused the interest of the banking industry in enthusiastically helping education. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Club Group donated 1,000 yuan and raised 400 yuan for Shengcunjie, which is deeply appreciated. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Shenbao Newspaper, In recent years, I have learned that your newspaper has launched a 'Reader Educational Assistance Fund', which I admire very much.

<p>Yesterday, the donors were 1,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Xingye Bank Club, 400 yuan raised for Shengcunjie, 1,706 yuan from all the employees of this newspaper (of which 647 yuan has been deducted, so the actual amount received yesterday was 1,059 yuan), 100 yuan from Mr. Li Xiaowen of Fukang Company, 100 yuan from Mr. Zhang Xiangchi, 18 yuan from Mr. Ni Yihe, 16 yuan from an anonymous person, 10 yuan from Ms. Zai Anli, 10 yuan from little sister Chen Peifen's savings from candy, Liu Zufa, Shi Yingen, Zhang Wenbiao, Shi Honggen, Yan Pengfei, and Li Donglin donated 5 yuan each, Wang Baoshan, He Jinzhi, Ding Hansheng, Liu Taixiang, Zhao Changlin, Zhu Genrong, and Miao Shenglin donated 2 yuan each, Li Yunzhang, Gong Lisheng, and Gu Juemin donated 1 yuan each.

After considering it, the colleagues deeply admire Mr. Su's difficult situation and the reason why he did not apply late. They expressed their full sympathy and decided that if Mr. Su has taken the university entrance examination and can be admitted, he will be allowed to apply exceptionally. As long as the investigation is deemed qualified, he will be assisted. I hope Mr. Su will notify us by letter after being admitted, and provide the detailed mailing address.</p>
<h3>The Robbery Case at the Rend De Sanatorium; The Handbag Contained Morphine</h3>
<p>The Rend De Sanatorium at No. 577 Haining Road was invaded by a thief posing as a patient for treatment at around 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. After being diagnosed by the director of the sanatorium, Xi Shimatsu, it was found that the person had no disease. While he was surprised, Wang Huanwu, a broker from Puxiang Pharmaceutical Company of the Museum Road, entered with a bag of medicines. The patient suddenly revealed a hideous face, showed a pistol, robbed the handbag, and fled without a trace. After the case occurred, the police thought that the thief had stayed in the sanatorium for a long time, and the purpose was only to rob a handbag, which seemed not that simple, so they have been conducting a strict investigation. It is now learned that the handbag actually contained a large amount of morphine, so the thief dared to wait patiently to rob it.</p>
<h3>A Quarrel Between Children Resulted in a Homicide; A Jiangbei Woman Ganged Up to Commit the Crime; Xu Shengxian Was Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>Xu Shengxian (50 years old), a native of Shaoxing, lived in a bungalow in Jiangjia Lane, Seymour Road. At around 6:00 p.m. on the 6th, because his son had a quarrel with the child of Chen Sunshi, a Jiangbei woman next door, Xu Shengxian went out to intervene. Chen ordered people to knock Xu to the ground, beating him with fists and feet, causing serious injuries to his throat, chest, and abdomen. He was on the verge of death. His wife, Zhu, heard the alarm and came out, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape. As a result, Chen Sunshi was arrested and handed over to the patrolman to be taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. On one side, she hired a car to send her husband Xu Shengxian to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at 10:45 a.m. the next morning. The body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road autopsy center to wait for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen Sunshi to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and asked for a postponement. Questioning Chen Sunshi, she confessed, "I didn't hit him at the time, I just dragged him down, please forgive me." Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that she be remanded in custody and rescheduled to wait for the verification of Xu Shengxian's body before reviewing it.</p>
<h3>Wen Lant亭 and Others Continue to Run the Food Hygiene Association</h3>
<p>Wen Lant亭, Shen Yingquan, Ding Fubao and other celebrities in this port have recently continued to run the Food Hygiene Association, advocating vegetarianism. The original letter said, "In the past, Dr. Wu Tingfang set up the Food Hygiene Association to promote vegetarianism, non-smoking, non-drinking, non-gambling, and all daily hygiene. It was quite beneficial to society. Unfortunately, the association's affairs were suspended not long after. It has been more than 20 years now. In recent times, this port has become increasingly extravagant. Usually, every meal is not complete without meat, and banquets are full of delicacies and famous wines, and all kinds of tobacco, to show off wealth and seek temporary pleasure for the appetite. They don't know that eating too much wine and meat will lead to high blood pressure, hardening of blood vessels, and easy kidney and liver diseases. Those who cannot enjoy longevity in the future are caused by this. The poison of cigarettes can cause palpitations, hyperactivity, insomnia, emaciation, memory loss, hardening of blood vessels, and affect the thyroid gland, causing premature aging and premature gray hair, etc., which is harmful and not beneficial. Therefore, when Lant亭 and others heard Dr. Wu's remarks that day, they implemented the Food Hygiene Association's doctrine, and smoking was naturally banned. If the main components of food, such as carbohydrates, protein fats, various vitamins, and minerals, are all obtained from vegetables and fruits, there is no fear of chronic meat poisoning. Therefore, for decades, physical strength and spirit have become stronger, which is not the gift of Dr. Wu's promotion of vegetarianism. Now we intend to solicit comrades to continue running this association. Those who wish to join the association, please send a detailed resume to No. 204 Mei Baige Road, Shanghai, and you will be a member of this association. This association serves the society and promotes public welfare, so no membership fee is charged. The date of the meeting and various printed materials will be notified later after consultation."</p>
<h3>Applications for Student Aid: An On-Site Inquiry Record (3)</h3>
<p>Peddlers, Carpenters, and Coppersmiths</p>
<p>Under the bright sunshine of the afternoon, I began my investigation work. Every day, I followed the addresses of numerous student aid applicants, visiting them one by one. After five days, the general conclusion I reached was that poverty is widespread in society. From this, it can be seen that while there are indeed many rich people, there are even more poor people. I hope the rich can help us and assist the poor!</p>
<p>The poor people I found included refugees, coppersmiths, carpenters, peddlers, and more. Moreover, the children of these poor people are all diligent in their studies, achieve excellent grades, and have good character. This is both a commendable and heartbreaking thing. There is a Mr. Zhang, who is from Liuhe. His old home was destroyed by artillery fire. His father initially sold fruit, but is now unemployed. His mother works as a seamstress, residing at a certain address in Cide Lane, Guangxi Road. They have a small space behind a neighbor's house. This tiny space is truly dark and gloomy. Fortunately, their neighbors are kind and occasionally help them with a meal. This situation is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>In addition, there is the son of a coppersmith, surnamed Zhou; and the son of a carpenter, surnamed Zhang. These two students are two years apart in age, but they are classmates in the same class, and both live in a wooden workshop on Beihai Road. Their grades are not bad, and their conduct is consistently graded as A. The coppersmith's son said that his father carries his tools out every day, sometimes making a living, and sometimes returning empty-handed. His mother works as a temporary seamstress. The family of three relies on this to survive. While speaking, he repeatedly expressed his grief. The carpenter's son lives in a loft. His 71-year-old father and 16-year-old son also live in this loft. According to the carpenter's son, "He was born in Shanghai. His mother died four months after his birth. His father has been a widower for 16 years, serving his elderly father and raising his son. He had to drop out of school for two years because he has a cough and is in poor health." Based on what he said, this carpenter is truly a filial son and righteous husband! (D)</p>
<p>Hardworking Youth</p>
<p>Yang Guanfu is 19 years old this year and just graduated from junior high school. He plans to enter the Wuxi Guoxue Specialized Academy in the second half of the year, but the entrance exam has not yet arrived. His father is a women's clothing tailor, and his older brother is also learning tailoring in Kowloon. He himself is determined to study. He lost his mother at the age of fifteen, and his father remarried, and has another younger brother. He also has a grandmother. Now, the family of five lives in a narrow and dark back room. His stepmother's kindness is certainly far less than that of his biological mother. Life is so poor, but he studies very diligently. Because of his good grades, the school has granted him a special exemption from tuition fees. In the application form, under the "Brief History" section, he wrote: "I grew up in a rural suburb of Shanghai. I came to Shanghai at the age of twelve and have been studying at Cunde Elementary School. I lost my virtuous mother at the age of fifteen, and the family's financial situation declined, gradually becoming desolate. As for studying in middle school, the school has granted me a special exemption from tuition fees."</p>
<p>When I went to visit him, he was not at home, and no one in his family was there. According to the second landlord, "He is at school and will not be back until evening. His family has returned to their hometown. They are really suffering!" So I left a note for him to come to the newspaper office for an interview. When I returned to the newspaper office, I suddenly received a letter he had sent the day before, saying: "Recently, due to the humble circumstances of my family, and with the rising cost of living, my father's meager salary is not enough to cover expenses, let alone provide surplus funds for my studies. Therefore, I am applying to your newspaper office for student aid. However, it so happened that my father is on summer break (Hongbang tailors have summer and winter breaks), and returned to his hometown last month for a short stay, in order to reduce expenses, leaving me alone in Shanghai. I find it very inconvenient to eat and live by myself, and I am also thinking of returning to my hometown. However, if your newspaper office sends someone to my residence for investigation, I will inevitably miss the visit. Therefore, I am writing to request that your staff inform me in advance of the investigation date, so that I can welcome you. This would be doubly beneficial. I wonder what your opinion is?..." The writing is concise and skillful, and his inner pain overflows from his words. Looking at his grades, he received A's in ten out of thirteen subjects, which is truly rare.</p>
<p>He came to the newspaper office on time. He is a gentle and quiet young man, and his physique does not seem to be very good. His sports score is the worst on his transcript, rated as a C. This is likely due to excessive study. It should be noted. According to him, in junior high school, he was not only exempt from tuition fees, but also received free meals at school. In addition to attending classes, he also managed the school library, so he was able to enjoy the free meals. After the summer vacation, he plans to take the entrance exam for the Wuxi Guoxue Specialized Academy, because he has a special interest in liberal arts, so he wants to continue his specialized study of Chinese classics. The entrance exam has not yet arrived, so I can only wish him good luck in the future, and to notify our newspaper office as soon as he is on the list, so that we can verify and process his application.</p>
<p>Young, studious, hardworking, and resilient, he is truly admirable! However, his body does not seem to be strong enough. This must be due to malnutrition and overwork! (T)</p>

Both men told the police that the bandits had demanded huge ransoms, asking Shi for 600,000 yuan and Zhu for 200,000 yuan. Zhu replied that his family was not wealthy, so the bandits reduced the ransom to 20,000 yuan. The two men also said that the bandits treated them like pigs and dogs, giving them only a bowl of coarse rice a day to eat, and that they had been confined for ten days without being able to stretch their muscles and bones.</p>

<p>Several Western detectives from the Central Police Station, including Detective Gus, went to the French Concession Town in two trucks, divided into two teams, each armed with pistols and a handheld machine gun.

<h3>Book Cart and Calligraphy Sale for Charity</h3>
<p>Truly a passionate advocate for student aid. The descendant of Ling Gu Ge, who does not reveal their surname, using the pseudonym Ling Gu Ge Zhu, the alias of their ancestor. In recent years, saddened by the times and indignant at the world, with sympathy for aspiring students who often drop out of school due to family pressures. This descendant feels deeply concerned and has generously taken on the responsibility of establishing scholarships to cultivate talent. There are many who establish scholarships in the world. For the most part, it is wealthy merchants and magnates, or funds raised for some kind of memorial. However, this descendant is neither a wealthy merchant nor a magnate, nor do they have a fund. They rent a few rooms, with no servants. An elderly couple who do everything themselves. They go out by foot, eat simple meals. So, where does their scholarship money come from? Their family business is antiques. They use what was inherited from their ancestor, and their lifelong collection, including calligraphy, paintings, bronzes, jade, etc. over five hundred items. They attempted an exhibition and public sale at the Ningbo Fellow Association in early April of this year, with marked prices, and after deducting expenses, all proceeds would be used for scholarships. Unfortunately, the meeting took place during dark and stormy weather, with few viewers. As a result, the actual amount sold was only a quarter of the goal, and all expenses consumed one-sixth of the sales amount. At that time, the number of students who had applied and been approved had reached 26, so they hurriedly ended the process. Some advised them to hold another public exhibition. The descendant sighed and said, "The world is not trustworthy, and things go against one's wishes, only increasing expenses. What is the point?" Chao Deng admires their lofty ideals and introduces them to generous gentlemen. From now on, if someone purchases their collection at a price, they will not only acquire treasures, but also indirectly support scholarships. A win-win situation for both public and private interests. Wouldn't that be wonderful? As for the names of the 26 scholarship recipients, the descendant does not wish to make them public. Those who wish to purchase their paintings can request to see the credentials. The descendant resides at No. 14 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinza Road, second floor. Their collection is stored elsewhere. If you are interested in purchasing, please send a letter first, and they will schedule a visit, or bring the items to you. It is all up to you. Feng Chaoran and Wang Boyuan co-announce.</p>

The British exchange rate has broken through the three-penny mark of 0.03125 from May 4th of last year, an unprecedented high price, and approached the three-penny barrier. It tightened from 0.03125 to 0.0284375 at the closing, an unprecedented high price.

HSBC's listed rates were revised downward. The silver balancing tax remained at 24.25%. After HSBC's small counter also listed the US dollar at 5 yuan, the price of gold gradually rose sharply. Amidst a double-edged buying spree by Sassoon, Japanese banks, Chinese speculators, and importers, HSBC, Citibank, and other banks, although supplying without fail, tightened the price from 5 yuan to 4.9375 yuan. At noon, banks were doing business with each other at 4.9375 yuan for August, and it was heard that HSBC's small counter US dollar rate had dropped to 4.875 yuan.

<h3>Outrageous Fiat Currency, Jealous Silver; Gold Price Reaches 900 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for gold rose wildly, and the uptrend escalated amidst chaotic conditions. The price has soared beyond the 7,000 yuan mark. Everyone is bullish, entirely because foreign currencies (the exchange rate for banks and speculators entered the five-yuan range) and the frenzy to buy up 1.6 to 1.7 million U.S. dollars, and British gold tightened to within three pence. And there was an unprecedented high price, so the Shanghai West Group sold out again and again. Yi Yuan, Yi Feng, Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yongzhi competed. However, among the gold shops, the Chengji Securities Group, Defu (later came out again) Yida, Chida, Yili, and Yinhang Group such as Hengji and Tianyuan's buying wave, there were more buyers, fewer sellers, so the price rose from 6,848 yuan to 7,100 yuan, and then rose another 230 yuan. The full day trading volume was 150,000 to 160,000 taels, for cash transactions in the morning, Xiangxing, Yongjin, and Chengji were at 100 taels, at a price of 8,600 yuan. Wanfeng's Shun Yuan was at 50 taels for 8,590 yuan. At 10:30, future deliveries skyrocketed, so no price was called out. In the afternoon, Hesheng sold 50 taels of Decheng, and the price had risen to an unprecedented high of 8,800 yuan, and then rose another 230 yuan, resulting in the gold jewelry price rising by 25 yuan, to a price of 900 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Bars Hit 7,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price for each gold bar (ten taels) at 9:15 am was 6,870 yuan, which was 35 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The price briefly fell back to 6,860 yuan. Chengji, Yida, Laili, and Jin哄(Hōng) pushed the price to 6,880 yuan, and then it was heard that the U.S. exchange rate tightened. Xin Feng, Yong Da, and Da Feng Yi Feng tried to sell, once falling to 32 yuan, falling to 6,848 yuan, while Defu, Yida, Chengji, and Laili maintained the price at around 6,860 yuan for a long time. It wasn't until after 10:30 that the foreign exchange tightening intensified, and it was heard that banks had less willingness to supply, and investor sentiment improved significantly. Yi Feng, Da Feng, and retail investors also came in to invest, rising by 50 yuan, breaking through 6,900 yuan and reaching 6,915 yuan. At that time, Yi Yuan, Xin Feng, Yong Ding, and Sheng sold to 6,885 yuan. Before long, the U.S. dollar was in the five-yuan range, and Xin Feng Yong returned. Chen Da, Hengji, Chengji, and Defu came to invest again, and sellers were unable to do anything. The price rose by 135 yuan, breaking through 7,000 yuan, reaching 7,020 yuan. Sometimes Yida pulled out, the Shanghai West Group resold to 6,990 yuan, then rose again, and the price was 7,000 yuan at noon. After closing, it then rose to 7,030 yuan. There were those in the buying spree who increased and marked the purchase at 5 and 10 yuan higher, and at 2:00 pm the opening price was 7,040 yuan, which was 40 yuan higher than the noon closing price. It then rose to 7,050 yuan, but Tong Kang, Yong Heng Ji, Yida Laili were sold a little down to 7,010 yuan, but it was difficult to return due to the tightness of the foreign exchange. Not long after, the buying spree was renewed. Dingsheng, Chida, Gong Da Xin Feng, Yong Yili, and Chengji came in. Yida has invested a huge number, causing two flights to reach 7,100 yuan. After Yifeng and Defu's force, it once retraced to 7,040 yuan, and finally in the buying surge market closed at 3:30, 7,065 yuan, which was 230 yuan higher than the previous day. It has been up for four consecutive days, for a total increase of 384 yuan, and is calculated by the 4.8125 ending price of the U.S. dollar in August. It was 7,236 yuan, a margin of 171 yuan. After the closing, Yida Tianyuan and Chengda raised the price to 7,100 yuan. Xin Fengyong listed the sale, with a final price of 7,0923 yuan. The highest and lowest prices of the day were 252 yuan. The spot price of the Cash No. Jinmen brand was 8,850 yuan, and the price was reduced by 200 yuan. There is no market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Sells for a High of 900 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry at the silverware shop, Datong Hang and Xintong Hang, increased by 5 yuan at 10:00 in the morning, to 880 yuan, and increased by 10 yuan at 3:00 in the afternoon, reaching a new high of 900 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. The repurchase price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers - Fluctuations Follow Exchange Rates - Excitement Added to the Dock Market - Short Sellers Eager to Cover Positions... Spot and Futures Prices Jump Wildly in Unison</h3>
<p>After fluctuating for two days, the yarn market has now rebounded, with a particularly strong surge this afternoon. This is due to the soaring silver tael price and the shrinking foreign exchange rates, which have boosted market sentiment. However, the major players in the industry have mediocre intentions, as factories are willing to sell. Only securities firms and gold traders are actively involved. Therefore, the morning market remained in a state of consolidation. However, Hong Kong traders have a strong demand for 32-count single yarn, with prices continuing to rise to around 40 yuan. Incoming shipments included 380 bales of Double Horse yarn from foreign firms and 365 bales of Golden Rooster yarn. Furthermore, 16 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai on the 9th, which indicates a generally healthy situation. 20-count Double Horse yarn traded at a high of 1,592 yuan and a low of 1,567 yuan. The afternoon market was volatile, with the silver tael price soaring and both British and American exchange rates shrinking. At the same time, the exchange jumped, causing panic among those with short positions, who rushed to cover. The initial trade was at 1,595 yuan, and in a flash, it jumped 600 yuan beyond the mark to 1,605 yuan, then to 1,618 yuan, and finally to 1,620 yuan. Along the way, those who had made profits sold, bringing the price down to 1,605 yuan. Later, due to favorable news, the price rose again to 1,620 yuan, with the final price being 1,619 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning market for Double Horse yarn was sluggish. The opening price was 1,572 yuan. Rumors circulated that a certain Feng and Co. were selling several hundred bales on behalf of the factory, causing market sentiment to weaken. However, the silver tael price was already showing signs of rising. The market remained lukewarm, hovering between 1,570 and 1,568 yuan for a long time. Customer transactions remained healthy, but market sentiment was difficult to lift. Unexpectedly, around 12:00, news broke that the silver tael price was 7,000 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions, pushing the closing price to 1,592 yuan. A review of the day's trading volume shows that 7,890 bales were traded. The amounts bought by various firms are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 890, Fellow traders 7,000, Total 7,890</p>
<p>The Double Horse futures market went from stability to a sharp rise, with violent fluctuations. The morning opened with a slight drop in American cotton, causing market sentiment to be unsettled. Although spot yarn was slightly more expensive than yesterday, it did not break out of the consolidation pattern. Therefore, the August futures contract opened with a slightly soft tone. Later, as foreign exchange rates gradually tightened, with both British and American exchange rates tightening to within 5 yuan and 2 ban shi (a fraction of a tael) on the black market, and the price of gold rising, breaking out of 7,000 yuan, yarn market sentiment became excited. Bullish traders frequently added to their positions, and short sellers covered their positions aggressively. The market was filled with buying pressure, creating a sense of impending storm. The August futures contract closed at 157.50, up 7 yuan; the September contract at 1534.00, up 12 yuan; and the October contract at 1547.50, up 11.5 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in spot yarn prices, the trend became even more positive. Speculators rushed to absorb the contracts. The August contract once reached a high of 1480.00, the September contract reached 1554.00, and the October contract reached 1568.00. However, the market weakened in the middle of the day as the gold market retreated. However, the final gains were still substantial, with increases ranging from 18.5 yuan to 28 yuan compared to the previous day. Looking at the futures market, because spot yarn sales were not smooth and the foundation was not yet solid, the main reason for the rise was entirely subject to foreign exchange and gold markets. Therefore, those who are long should still proceed with caution. A table of daily price movements is listed below.</p>
<h3>Speculation Active - Moving into the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is trending tight, with the silver tael price soaring and foreign exchange rates shrinking. The yarn market is rising, causing market sentiment to be positive, and the cotton market is increasing accordingly. Trading among industry players is booming, and the concept of price increases is becoming increasingly ingrained.</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai indicates that trading in imported cotton is quite active, driven by a sharp rise in the silver tael price and a tightening of American exchange rates, which have prompted general speculators and cotton firms to purchase spot goods. Yesterday, the price of Brazilian cotton rose by about 7 or 8 yuan compared to the previous day. However, at the same time, due to the lack of clarity on the Pacific situation and the not very solid position of Shanghai, trading in forward cotton does not seem to be very active.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is unsettled and uneven. It initially rose due to political news from Washington that the Smith bill to freeze government loans for cotton would be released tomorrow, and due to some short covering. However, it subsequently fell back due to profit-taking by long traders and sales from New Orleans. As a result, closing prices were down 4 or 5 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday.</p>
<p>It is predicted that the opening market today will be one rupee lower than yesterday.</p>
<h3>Grain - Imported Rice Thinking of Rising Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of imported rice initially rose and then weakened. The market still showed signs of consolidation. However, large traders and speculators were absorbing the supply, ultimately pushing the price up by about one yuan. The early market opening attracted the attention of large traders in Shanghai West and other areas. Later, due to various rumors in the market, "skinball" traders eager to take advantage of the situation also inquired, and the market price was immediately kicked up. However, the ultimate destination was the absorption of floating surpluses by large traders and speculators. The actual fundamental customers were stagnant, leading to profit-taking by floating traders after the price increase, and a lack of buyers, as well as a rush to sell newly arrived goods. The market then fell, initially rising by 1 or 2 yuan, but ultimately only gaining half a yuan to one yuan. However, small-grained spot rice initially rose from 121 yuan to as high as 123.5 yuan, and then fell slightly to 122.5 yuan at the close. British-Indian rice was as high as 150.05 yuan, but closed at 149.5 yuan, then 147.5 yuan. Second-grade Siamese rice was 140.05 yuan to 140 yuan, and broken rice was 105.5 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 800 to 900 tons, with 23,000 to 24,000 bags of spot rice. The total stock of imported rice in warehouses is approximately 1,214,000 bags.</p>
<p>After stabilizing previously, the price of thick and thin Japonica rice rose yesterday due to limited supply and the rising price of imported rice. Both buyers and sellers had positive sentiment, with sellers holding goods in anticipation of higher prices, and local stores and visiting merchants considering purchasing in anticipation of rising prices. This created a perception of supply shortages, and the prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice immediately increased by 1 or 2 yuan. Early Indica rice from Kai Nan Port was 151.5 yuan, settling at 148 yuan. Original white Japonica rice from Wuxi was 146 yuan. As for the new Japonica rice from Pudong, 16 dan (a unit of weight) arrived yesterday, opening at 157 yuan, and settling at 155 yuan, an increase of one yuan, depending on the quality of the goods.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also saw brisk sales during this favorable period, and prices generally increased by nearly one yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice opened at 100 yuan and rose to as high as 125 yuan, settling at 120 yuan. Nuo Cha rice was 114 yuan to 110 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 126 to 127 yuan.</p>
<p>The Flour Market Thinking of Moving</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market turned firmer due to active sales. The flour market had been quite quiet for the past week, due to the small confirmation of unified management of foreign firms and the balanced market supply and demand amid falling rice prices. Golden Dragon flour hovered around 32 yuan, while Fortress flour hovered around 33 yuan, with fluctuations of only 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. As of the closing on the previous day, Golden Dragon flour was 31.9 yuan and Fortress flour was 33.1 yuan, with Golden Dragon flour being relatively lower due to larger inventories. Other brands were consistently stable. At the opening of the market yesterday morning, news suddenly broke of foreign exchange entering the country. In the context of rising prices, sellers immediately adopted a conservative approach, and speculators took the opportunity to move. As a result, trading in various goods gradually became active. Yu Long flour opened at 31.85 yuan, and then rose to 31.9 yuan to 31.95 yuan as rice prices rose. Fortress flour was 33.1 yuan, and the afternoon market increased to 33.2 yuan, a slight increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Bell Tower brand Australian flour, due to insect damage, was still at 33.5 yuan, and Double Eagle brand was at 32.45 yuan, a significant increase. Green Treasure flour was 32.2 to 32.3 yuan but not settled. The total trading volume was 30,000 bags, and the market seemed to be turning around.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains quiet. For the past week, less than 3,000 bags of new wheat have arrived from the suburbs. Although various flour mills have slightly relaxed their purchase prices, there is still no wheat to buy. It is reported that Japanese factories are receiving 200 to 300 bags per day, with prices having been raised to 44 yuan. Chinese factories have also raised their purchase prices to 47.5 yuan, but purchases remain scarce.</p>
<h3>Oil Market - Citing Low Arrivals - Oil Prices Repeatedly Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the edible oil market once again rose sharply, due to the continued sluggish supply and the increasingly thin inventory. Oil merchants deliberately disrupted the market, creating a shortage of oil. As a result, prices were uniformly raised again by 5 to 6 yuan. 1 jian (a unit of measure) of raw Jiaozhou oil was sold at 183.5 yuan, 50 barrels of raw Qingdao oil at 265 yuan, 40 barrels of bean oil at 256.5 yuan, 100 dan (a unit of weight) of Da You bean oil at 204 yuan to 203 yuan, and 500 dan of clear oil at 170 yuan to 170.5 yuan. 300 dan of rapeseed oil from Lide Factory was priced at 165 yuan to 171.5 yuan, 200 dan of rapeseed oil from Yoshida Factory was priced at 169 yuan to 170 yuan, and nearly 1,000 dan of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory was priced at 163 yuan to 172 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities - More Internal Debt Sold - Market Meanders Downwards</h3>
<p>The unofficial public debt market gradually showed signs of weakness yesterday. Although large traders covered their positions, it was not enough to offset the strong selling pressure. Buyers gradually lost interest, becoming hesitant and gradually selling off their positions. Lottery draw of Class A public bonds will be held today, and yesterday afternoon's market prices reflected the deduction for the lottery winnings. The future of the bond market is likely to be a gradual, curved decline, and it will be difficult to make progress in the short term. Yesterday morning, Gong Mao, Yi Tai, and Xin Fu were all buying Class A bonds. Lian He Hao entered Class C and exited Class A. Chang Ji specialized in exiting Class A. Hong Da exited both Class A and Class C. Lian Yi exited both Class C and Class E. The closing prices at noon were slightly down by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, Heng Kang, Xie Da, and Lian Yi bought in, while Xie Xing Yuan and Zhong Fu Bank sold in greater amounts. The market slightly decreased by 0.1 jiao. As a result, Class A bonds decreased by 2 yuan due to the lottery draw, while the rest decreased by only 0.25 to 0.45 yuan. The total trading volume was only around 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 41.1 yuan.</p>
<p>At the Public Industry Association stock market, prices rose and fell sharply as many traders slightly unwound their positions. The market closed slightly firmer. Public bus shares had risen for several days and retreated about one yuan yesterday, closing at 18.7 yuan. Xiang Tai Timber Company shares also closed at the lowest price in almost a week.</p>
<p>Rubber shares were quiet, with only Chen's and Karen Tan shares showing an increase.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Remain Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained bullish due to the unconfirmed news that Dutch ships had stopped coming to Shanghai. Futures prices initially softened and then rose, ultimately showing little change. The August 10th contract opened at 107.5 yuan, and then rose to 8 jiao, 5 jiao, and 9 yuan. The August 20th contract initially tightened and then softened, initially at 112 yuan, 12.3 yuan, and then at 11 yuan to 11.7 yuan and 0.3 jiao. Prices from the guild indicate that spot goods are tighter. July arrivals were 210 yuan, 12.5 yuan, 10.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. June was 109 yuan, 9.5 yuan, 10 yuan, up 1 yuan. May was 108.5 yuan, 9.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. April was 108 yuan, 9 yuan, up 1.7 yuan. Dutch red KD marked sugar, which was offered at 98 yuan the day before but not sold, had risen to 100 yuan yesterday. Tai Koo granulated white B mark sugar was offered at 138 yuan, and HX mark sugar was offered at 115 yuan. On the 9th, 1,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Seafood - Fish Skin and Fish Maw are Both Expensive</h3>
<p>The inventory of fish skin and fish maw remains scarce recently, and market prices are gradually rising. For example, raw public fish skin is 450 yuan to 360 yuan, white fish skin is 640 yuan to 550 yuan, and mother skin is 420 yuan. Fish maw is particularly expensive, such as long glue being 850 yuan, yellow fish maw hanging slices being 1,250 yuan, yellow slices being 880 yuan, Guang Tu high-quality goods being 3,000 yuan, settling at 2,200 yuan, and moon maw being 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar and Sugar Cane (IV) (Part on China)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>According to the Sugar Frost Manual written by Wang Zhuo of Suining in the Song Dynasty, "During the Dali period of the Tang Dynasty (766-799 AD), there was a monk named Zou, who rode a white donkey to Mount Umbrella, lived in thatched huts in Zhong County (now Sichuan). He needed salt, rice, firewood, vegetables, etc. He would write on a small piece of paper, tie it with a string of money, and leave it for the donkey to carry to the market. People knew it was Zou, took the fair price, hung the goods on the saddle, and let it return. One day, the donkey damaged Huang's sugar cane seedlings at the foot of the mountain. Huang asked Zou for compensation. Zou said, 'You don't know that "sugar can be turned into frost," and the profit can be a thousand times over; I'll tell you how to compensate.' He tried it, and it worked. From then on, the method spread..." From the phrase "sugar can be turned into frost," it is of course refining the coarse sand sugar through a process of frying and condensing; however, the "sugar frost" produced in this way is definitely not the "white granulated sugar" we are now familiar with, because the Sugar Frost Manual immediately notes "light purple is the best, deep amber is next, light yellow is also good, and light white is the lowest." It even cites Su Dongpo's poem to Monk Yuanbao of Suining, "Icy plate of amber, how can it compare to the beauty of sugar frost," which fully indicates that the sugar frost was amber in color, not "light and white like frost" as Li Shizhen said. Although Liang Shaoren of the Qing Dynasty (in Rambling Notes from An Autumn Rain Anemone) saw the Sugar Frost Manual citing Huang Shangu's reply to the magistrate of Zizhou, Yong Xi Changyi, sending sugar frost in the poem "Sending sugar frost from afar, knowing it has flavor, better than Cui's crystal salt," he believed that this referred to white granulated sugar; I believe that this is clearly comparing the "flavor" of sugar to salt, and does not mention the color of the sugar being like crystal salt, so these two lines of poetry cannot be used as evidence that China could already produce white granulated sugar at that time (To be continued)</p>
<h3>An Outline of China's Currency System Reform - Issuance Begins Today -</h3>

<h3>The Issue of Vaccination Injections</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Several readers have submitted articles expressing their opinions on the matter of vaccination injections. Some believe that public health agencies sending people to street corners to give injections is sometimes not in line with hygiene principles. Firstly, disinfection procedures are sometimes not followed, and a single needle is used on several people; secondly, the dosage is questionable; and thirdly, while it is usually given in three doses at a doctor's office, only one dose is given on the street. In addition, the attitude of some white-coated staff is truly off-putting. These are issues that the responsible authorities should try to improve.</p>
<p>Apart from the above points, there is undoubtedly nothing wrong with getting vaccination injections. To protect one's own life and to safeguard public health, everyone who has the opportunity should enjoy the right to get vaccinated!</p>
<p>Today, we are publishing a self-description by a vaccination injector that is both laughable and thought-provoking. This is from a different perspective. In addition to one's own viewpoint, being able to put oneself in someone else's shoes and observe society from their position can often give us many new insights and lessons.</p>
<p>Profession</p>
<h3>I am Only a Vaccination Injector</h3>
<p>— Hidden</p>
<p>For two years, I have been clearly disappointed with my position. I went to do the work of "serving society" and "benefiting the people" with a full of enthusiastic emotion, but I was met with malicious abuse. This cannot but make me feel heartbroken.</p>
<p>Every time I put on the thick white coat and stand at the crossroads, I gently say to passers-by as they approach, "Friend, come and get a shot, it's for your own health."</p>
<p>"Bah! Who wants it." Many sharp, piercing, and ruthless mouths answer in this way.</p>
<p>I can't help but hang beads of sweat on my forehead, standing there reluctantly. When bored, I look longingly at the azure sky, "Alas! Are people really so ignorant and cruel?" I mutter to myself, and a layer of gloom covers my soul.</p>
<p>"This job, despised by coolies and looked down upon by gentlemen, how can I endure it?" Every time I am mocked, ridiculed, and abused by passers-by, I am so angry that I even prepare to resign. But in order to live, I have to walk onto my execution ground -- the crossroads -- like a criminal.</p>
<p>Friend, you see, because of poor work, the Director, touching his "eight-character mustache" and speaking fluent French, scolds, no, simply insults me.</p>
<p>"...Chinese people are ignorant, stupid, and don't know what's good for them. Persuasion is ineffective, it should be forced, yes, treat the Chinese as..."</p>
<p>Ah! How can I go on? I am also a Chinese person with spirit, blood, and conscience.</p>
<p>After that, a Russian helper was added to every two groups.</p>
<p>With their strong, hairy hands, they dragged passers-by over like grabbing chickens. Then those who could escape escaped, those who could run ran, creating a noisy mess. What was originally "a deserted place" is now crowded around a small square table.</p>
<p>Every time after people have received the injection, they shoot me a fierce look. They vent the anger they have suffered from the "Russian Devil" onto me like bee stings: "Hey! I recognize you."</p>
<p>"Yi! What for? Friend, this is for your own health." I tirelessly explain again and again, dozens of times.</p>
<p>"Bastard! Traitor! A lackey of national ruin! What kind of death injection are you giving, heartless, × what, it makes my arm ache and I have chills at night."</p>
<p>"Chills are a reaction, there is no harm; temporary soreness can guarantee your life." I explain again like a missionary.</p>
<p>"！Hey, nonsense, who asked you to hit me? Death is my own death, what does it have to do with you? I don't want you kneeling on the ground, nor do I want you to wear mourning clothes." People reveal gold-rimmed teeth and grin hideously.</p>
<p>I wipe the spittle on my face and answer patiently, "Friend, but this is infectious! For example: if you die from the plague, your family and the neighbors around you will be threatened by germs. If they have not been vaccinated, they will follow in your footsteps!"</p>
<p>"Bah! Don't jinx me."</p>
<p>"Jackson, don't bother with them." The Russian devil shouts impatiently, pushing, squeezing, dragging, and pulling people madly.</p>
<p>"Hey! Bastard! Lackey!" Thousands of fierce eyes are fixed on me, ah! My soul sinks into a sea of bitterness.</p>
<p>Friend, I am not the lackey you imagine, I am a Chinese person with spirit, blood, and conscience. We are standing on the same front. But getting vaccinated is ultimately for your own health. (Moved to scholarship fund)</p>
<p>Invention</p>
<h3>Daily Changing Inventions</h3>
<p>— Yan Fu</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Britain has had thousands of new inventions, many of which are practical and beneficial to mankind. There are also many new inventions in the United States. However, among their new inventions, some are certainly very useful, while others are quite laughable. Here are a few that have already been patented:</p>
<p>(1) Eyeglasses without lenses</p>
<p>(2) A thief-catching window. This window is able to trap a thief around the waist when he climbs over half of his body on the windowsill.</p>
<p>(3) A coffin with internal lighting</p>
<p>(4) An alarm clock that swings a rope to slap a sleeping person's face to wake him up</p>
<p>(5) Cigarettes printed with invisible advertisements. The advertisement is revealed when the cigarette is lit and smoked.</p>
<p>(6) An ice pack made in the shape of a hat for treating headaches</p>

<p>Eleventh Night Singing</p>
<p>Wasn't she thinking that her father would immediately ask her to go to the city? When she went, she would inevitably have to hand over her school meal expenses. At that time, it would absolutely be no problem to divide five or ten yuan from this amount to give to Shang Laoer; and at the same time, she thought: Shang Laoer only taught her acting for half a month, at most give him ten yuan, and she can get over this thing, right?</p>
<p>"Let's do it this way!" She decided to no longer care about what Qiu Haitang was saying to Sister Meng outside, and would apologize to her in the evening.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the seventh time that she opened the lid again that the dozen or so cakes were finally steamed. At the same time, she realized that she had put too much water in the pot, which is why it took so long to cook. She hurriedly put four cakes on a small plate, poured a cup of hot tea early, and carried it out on a tray.</p>
<p>"What? Sister Meng has already left?" As soon as she came out, she saw her father sitting alone in the main room, with his head hanging down, as if he had a lot on his mind.</p>
<p>"Gone."</p>
<p>"Did you tell her I'm not going to learn acting? Did she have anything to say?" Mei Bao put the cakes and tea on a table near Qiu Haitang as she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang only picked up the hot tea and took a sip, not paying attention to the cakes.</p>
<p>"I told her." He replied listlessly, "How can this thing still be put off? She went back after hearing what I said."</p>
<p>When Mei Bao heard this, she thought that things were over, and a smile of relief could not help but appear on her face. (180)</p>

<h3>Two-Way Double-Layer Small Tea Table</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>In modern family life, due to limited space, it is necessary to find ways to utilize various pieces of furniture, with simplicity and economy as the principle. Therefore, various countries in Europe and America have already invented sofa beds and wall beds. The former can be used as a sofa during the day and converted into a bed at night, while the latter is embedded in the wall, which is extremely beneficial for saving space. Recently, someone invented a type of double-layer small tea table, with the upper layer made of mirror, which can be used as a tea table in peacetime, placing cups, plates and vases, but when necessary, it can be transformed into a dressing table, which is also a new and imaginative invention.</p>
<p>All of these new inventions have been sent to the US market; each inventor is hoping to make a fortune from his inventions. What will happen, of course, remains to be seen, but it is beyond doubt that some of them will be able to earn one hundred and eighty thousand immediately. Seeing that there are so many new inventions, how should we feel?</p>

<h3>Listening to Music on Summer Nights</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>In the half-year I've been in Shanghai, I've attended quite a few concerts. I have a friend who is a "concert connoisseur" who takes me to every concert. From February to now, I have listened to nearly forty concerts of different natures. Among them were symphonic, piano, string ensemble, Chinese classical music, and solo vocal performances of various kinds; but perhaps because of my bad mood, I often didn't have the patience to listen to the entire concert. Some performances were not very good, and some of the selections were terrible; since facing reality was out of the question, even the "pure music" failed to make one forget reality because the performances were not "divine" enough, so I often pulled my "music expert" friend away.</p>
<p>Recently, there was an exception. It was when I happened to see a news item about the Experimental Music Society in the newspaper: even my "music expert" friend didn't pay much attention to this news, implying that it wasn't worth listening to. However, that night I secretly went alone to the Russian Art Theater to try listening to the concert that my "music expert" friend didn't care about. The weather that day was so hot, it was like taking a steam bath. When the chorus appeared on stage, performing the "Dunayevsky Collection," I realized that almost half of the program had already been played.</p>
<p>The songs were all familiar, but I hadn't heard them in a long time; this string of pearl-like songs seemed to summon back my soul and restore my lost memories.</p>
<p>I thought I was the only appreciative listener in the audience, planning to be the first to applaud when the "Motherland Song" ended, but the applause of the entire audience erupted, and I couldn't hear my own existence. A stranger sitting next to me looked at me with kind, brotherly eyes and said, "Good—really good!" I noticed that his whole body and forehead were covered in sweat, and only then did I realize that I, too, had forgotten the weather.</p>
<p>After the intermission, I went back into the theater to be "baptized"; the works were all very lively and fresh, and the last three choruses were all good. The most unforgettable were the painting-like "From Border to Border" and "The Song of the Sower."</p>
<p>After the concert, I talked with the friend next to me, who expressed to me in the Changzhou accent of Mandarin that he was one of the "Shiyin fans" (fans of the Experimental Music Society). I asked him why they don't do regular and popular performances? The current seat prices seem too high. He said, "Then let's write a letter to request a popular performance."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Drama and Art</h3>
<p>— Fen Yu</p>
<p>Kun Dan (female role in Peking opera) Zheng Bingru, after stopping her performances at the Golden Grand Theater, had intended to film a "Yu Tang Chun" movie for the recently established Lianxin Film Company, but unfortunately, the director Fei Mu fell ill. Her father could not stay in Shanghai to oversee the project, so due to time constraints, this plan may be abandoned. Lianxin prepared a capital of sixty thousand yuan to shoot this film.</p>
<p>"Gong Wu Tai" (Common Stage) is performing their first show, but the results are poor, so they are already preparing to rehearse the second one. It is said that there is a song in the second show, and they are currently asking a musician to compose it, planning to record it and send it to various radio stations that don't charge money to broadcast it.</p>
<p>The "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" play edited by Wei Ruhui is scheduled to be performed by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society at the Lafei Theater on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. Rehearsals have already begun. Because this play is a spoken drama with mechanical scenery, Wei Jun has specially invited the famous actor Zhang Yipeng to be the consultant to guide everything.</p>
<p>The Tianchan Stage last night, due to the sudden rainstorm that enveloped the entire city, the area in front of the stage became a swamp, and they temporarily announced the suspension of the performance. Other theaters opened as usual.</p>
<h3>Zhang Huichong to Direct a Martial Arts Film</h3>
<p>— Hu Gu</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong, who starred in "Silver Spear Bandit" for Guolian, is said to be directing a film for Guolian after completing this film. According to a reporter yesterday, Zhang Huichong signed a contract with Guolian the day before yesterday to direct "A Body Full of Courage" and also star in it.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Huichong to the reporter: "A Body Full of Courage" is scheduled to start filming on the 15th of this month. In addition to him playing the male lead, the female lead will be selected from Gong Qiuxia or Zhang Fan. In addition, the co-stars include Wang Xianzai, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and others.</p>
<p>It is said that in "A Body Full of Courage," there will be a new face on the screen, Miss Wu Ming, a student from the Modern Film and Drama School. She was introduced to Huichong by a friend, who believes that she meets the conditions for the screen, so he agreed to give her an important supporting role. It is expected that this martial arts film will be much more advanced than previous ones.</p>
<p>Brief News (1) "Female Zombie" is the debut work of the new director Mei Qian of Yihua. The script is uniquely created, using horror as the warp and detective work as the weft, weaving together a novel and unique science film. It took eighty days to film. The sets, sound effects, costumes, and everything were carefully arranged to achieve perfection. It has now been completely edited and will be shown at the Xinguang Grand Theater soon. (2) The second issue of "Movie Star Special," the Romance Special, has been published. The content is exciting, including "Chen Yunshang's Lover," "Settling Shu Shi's Romantic Account," and "Zhou Manhua's Three Pages of Romance," etc. The photos are valuable and sold for six corners at newsstands.</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden (Opera Circle)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(29) Gai Jiaotian</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian, also known as Gai Jiao Yi, is fifth in his family, surnamed Zhang, given name Yingjie. He initially studied Laosheng (old male role), but his voice deteriorated, so he switched to Wusheng (martial male role), and became famous for his short-play martial arts performances. His agility and speed were unmatched by his peers. Moreover, he had a great understanding of rhythm, so when the wind and rain were at their most intense, he would perfectly match the drumbeats, with no deviation whatsoever. His strictness and compactness were unmatched. Some say that Gai Jiaotian actually learned from Li Chunlai, but this statement is probably not entirely true. Both are famous for short-play martial arts performances, so they happen to be similar. To say that his origin is from Chunlai, Gai Jiaotian may not be willing to accept it. Moreover, the plays of "Li" and "Gai" each have their own extremes, so why distinguish between their relative merits? In addition to new plays, Gai Jiaotian adheres to the rules and regulations when performing old plays, such as wearing a small hat with sparse tassels and not applying powder to his face. This alone is enough to make the martial male roles of the Beijing opera circle feel embarrassed. The existence of such a person in the Jiangwai school (outside of Beijing) adds a lot of color to it. He is also diligent in practicing, without regard for the cold or heat, never stopping even for a day. It is rare to see an actor so dedicated, even in his old age. The return of his great fame is by no means accidental. The year before last, he injured his foot while performing "Wu Song" at the Grand Theater, so he often avoids performing techniques such as "spinners" and "splits." However, everything can still make people satisfied, and there is no sense of regret. I can say without hesitation that he is the only one in the Jiangwai school!</p>
<h3>Twin Flowers of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan and Xiao An Jiao Luoqi</p>
<p>The old man rubbed his old eyes and nodded, saying, "So you are Yuan Yuan! I have long heard of your beauty in Beijing, and I am very fortunate to be able to witness your celestial beauty today." After the old man finished speaking, he laughed heartily. The crowd echoed his laughter. Yuan Yuan couldn't help but shudder at the sound of laughter. The writer Xiyu also felt that something was amiss when he saw these people. Indeed, Yuan Yuan's beauty was too attractive. So, he took her jade arm and hurried back along the mountainside path. Yuan Yuan vaguely saw the flower butterfly gesticulating and talking to the old man. The two hurried to where the mountain sedan chair was parked. Yuan Yuan said to the writer, "Didn't you see? Just now, a group of people were staring at me with burning eyes. I don't know where that old man came from. Judging from his aura, he is very noble and must be a high-ranking official. And there is a frivolous young man among them, that flower butterfly. You know that this person has hated me very much lately!" The writer frowned immediately upon hearing this and said, "Flower butterfly, I have seen him once too. I know that this person has ill intentions towards you." Yuan Yuan said, "Yes, that's why we moved our family to Hengtang, because of him." The writer looked to the east and saw that the group of people was at the edge of the Xiangxie corridor, seemingly about to come this way. So, he said, "Let's go back to the boat." So, the two sat on the mountain sedan chair and asked the villagers carrying the sedan chair to carry them back to the boat. When they went down the mountain, they saw many carriages and horses parked at the foot of the mountain, as well as many guards and attendants. Only then did they realize that the old man touring the mountain was indeed a noble person with a great background. They also saw the Suzhou prefect arriving in a sedan chair, and they guessed that he was going up the mountain to serve the noble person. The two quickly returned to the boat and instructed the boatman to return. It was already Shen Shi (3-5 PM), and the red sun had not yet set over the mountains. The river waves reflected the sunlight, glittering with a golden color. Where there was no sunlight, it was as clear and blue as autumn silk, as picturesque as a painting. A duck boat was rocking towards them, with a large group of ducks floating on the water in an orderly fashion, quacking incessantly. The writer pointed to Yuan Yuan and said, "The ducks are the first to know when the spring river warms, how lovely and picturesque this group of ducks is." Yuan Yuan smiled and said, "Not only is it picturesque, but it is also full of poetic sentiment." (137)</p>
