<h3 id="c9">近東的警報 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>在德軍進攻烏克蘭甚急聲中，全世界的視綫又集中在土耳其和伊朗兩國的運命。關於前者，盛傳希特勒已自蘇聯前綫抽調摩托化部隊四師。集中保加利亞南部，壓迫土國接受兩點：一為准許德軍通過安那多利亞區。以直趨叙利亞。伊拉克。伊朗乃至外高加索；二為准許義國艦隊經由達達尼爾海峽開入黑海，以協助德軍對付蘇聯海軍。關於伊朗，一方有德國第五縱隊的滿佈各重要據點。另一方則有英蘇兩國的聯合警告德黑蘭政府，要求驅逐德僑出境，並准許英國假道伊朗接濟蘇聯；一昨甚至謠傳印度英軍司令華維爾將軍已率部經由俾路支攻入伊朗境內。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事之必將波及小亞細亞和中東各國，遠在今春希臘抗戰時期，以及厥後伊拉克叙利亞兩次事變中，即已為世人所熟道；德蘇戰事爆發之後。一般人對於土耳其不知以歐洲各戰敗國的遭遇為殷鑒，一味固執所謂中立政策的苟安心理，旣感到十二分的惶惑，同時對於英國在叙利亞事變結束之後，不知在近東方面作進一步行動，以呼應紅軍的英勇抗戰，毋寗也多少覺得失望。具體點講。當初納粹攻蘇果能迅速奏功。它的次一步行動必然是壓迫土耳其一合作」。以便進而染指近東，反之，如果攻蘇閃電戰遭遇挫折，則為補救起見，也必然要向小亞細亞另求出路，土國政府旣明知無論德蘇之戰結果如何，自身均有被納粹蹂躪的一日，然則為什麼不肯當機立斷。早定去從，而必須等到德軍傾全力向烏克蘭進犯，行見兵臨國門的今日，纔忙着講求應付？同樣地。英國經過伊拉克和叙利亞兩次敎訓，應該早就覺悟近東一隅，已成納粹第五縱隊活動的對象，在德國未實行侵蘇之前，猶可說是顧慮刺激莫斯科，所以寗願「相安無事」，今茲紅軍獨力抗戰，已逾兩月，英國雖一方喊着援助，一方答應聯合行動，但事實上除由空軍排日出擊外，其他方面幾乎一無動靜，甚至原在作戰中的菲洲前綫，也差不多入於冬眠狀態，直到最近德軍在烏克蘭方面加緊進攻。獲有相當戰果之後，纔聽見英國因發現伊朗境內有納粹份子，而忙着提警告，實則遠在德蘇開戰的初期，英國就應該在近東和小亞細亞方面，軍事外交，雙管齊下，迅速完成必要的佈置，至低限度。似乎應該向對方佔領未久，而當地敵愾之心又未完全泯滅的若干地方——例如希臘的薩洛尼加，發動反攻，藉以呼應紅軍，即使無成，至少在戰略上，可以收到牽掣納粹若干兵力，同時鼓勵紅軍士氣的兩重戰果；當然，為進行這一反攻戰事。倘能在事前取得土耳其的合作，自必更有制勝把握，不過，誠如前面所言。這種側面戰事。目的祗在牽掣敵人，困擾敵人，使德軍首尾受敵，所以事實上並不需要立即奏凱，一次登陸不成，不妨繼以二次，此地不易得手，不妨另覔弱點，如此常川進攻，使敵方疲於應付。同時對於近東各國，尤其應該予以絕對的控制。傳進可以假道接濟蘇聯，退可以解除紅軍後顧之憂，如果直到德軍已開抵黑海沿岸，甚至正在壓迫安加拉政府的時候，纔忙着鞏固後方。縱非失之太遲。至少已經「事倍功」半」。</p>
<p>綜上所述。可見民治陣綫此際對於近東局勢，已不容再事猶豫，必須劍及履及，出以明快行動；同時問題中的伊土兩國更應把過去無數弱小被侵略國逐個擊破的殷鑒，引以為戒。假定不分友敵。自甘墮落，則無疑地，土耳其將成保加利亞第二，伊朗則並斯濟伐克而不如矣。</p>

<p>塔斯社二十三日莫斯科電蘇德戰事過去兩月之結果如下、紅軍向侵境之希特勒軍隊作戰兩個月之結果、證明德指揮之「閃電殲滅」紅軍計劃完全破產、祇在一月前、德指揮猶向全世界宣稱德軍已打通至莫斯科列寗格勒及基輔各道路、但事實上各該通道已為吾車阻塞、且由紅軍擊潰德法西斯數十師團、兩個月之事實證明紅軍未被消滅目巳日趨强盛、敵人雖佔領若干城市、但巳付出極大代價、在人力及物力方面損失不貲、</p>
<p>在過去三星期中、紅軍已粉碎德軍六十師之多（一）坦克師十二師團、包括第三·四·七·十·十一·十二·十三·十四·十五·十六·十八·十九·及第二十師、（二）步兵師二十七師團、包括第五·十一·二四·二六·二八·三十·三二·四四·五十·五二·六二·六八·七一·七九·八六·九四·九五·九九·一〇一·一〇六·一一〇·一一一·一二一·一二五·一三七·一五六·一五七·一六一·二〇六·二五三·二六·二六三·二九〇·二九三·二九七·二九八·二九九師、（三）摩托化師八師團、包括第二·八·十四·十七·十八·二十·二五·二七·摩托化師（四）挺進師三師、包括第三·十一·及三十師、（五）各師步兵團十七團、包括第二三·二四·二五·二九·一三五·二五五·二六〇·二六八·二七九·三〇七·三一一·三一二·四六二·四八〇·四八五·四八六·五三〇團、及「德國」「維金」等團、此外若干師團亦已各存實亡、每運祇剩十人至十二人、兩個月戰事結果、德官兵傷亡及被俘者達二白萬人、戰兵損失同樣重大、據準確統計、在兩個月中德損失坦克八千輛、大砲一萬尊、及飛機七千二百架、至於紅軍陣亡者十五萬、傷者四十四萬、失蹤者十一萬、德計七十萬人、此外並損失世克五千五百輛、大砲七千五百尊、飛機四千五百架、</p>
<p>紅軍堅强抵抗結果、已粉碎德軍無敵神話、紅軍仍擁有巨大力量、非俟敵人被殲、決不中止抗戰、由是觀之、兩個月之戰爭已證明下項事實、（一）希特勒之六星期結束戰事計劃已完全失敗、顯明的戰爭必將延長、德軍損失之慘重必將加速希特勒主義之崩潰、（二）若干城市之陷落、並不影嚮紅軍之繼續抗戰、直至德軍被殲滅為止、（三）德人力物力均將告竭、國際地位亦趨惡劣、但紅軍則已獲得同盟、實力因而日益增强、歷史證明在戰爭進行中實力增加之國家及軍隊必可獲勝、反之、凡在戰期內實力日趨薄弱之國家及軍隊必吿失敗、</p>

<p>中國偉大</p>
<p>早上，馬君跑到我們小屋來，我正用二盆水洗面，他銳：「將有飛機來了。你預備逃到田裏去嗎？」「你預備怎樣？我問。村中一無躱避之處，一間茅屋當然沒有什麼功用，但在泥田中跋涉，也不是一件有趣的事情。我們從各方面討論此事時，聽到機聲由遠地的嗡嗡變到近段的喤隍，我們望着灰黑色的天空，等待這最緊張的一刻，靜聽第一個炸彈的擲下。飛機過去了。村中的警報聲像一面鑼，是敲擊一個未爆炸的炸彈圓筒而成聲浪。「他們也許是去炸韶關了。」馬君很不愉快地說。他的妻子兒女都在那邊。</p>
<p>他們引我們到一處砲塞去。遙望日軍一面，沒有什麼聲響此地前綫可稱中國最安靜的地方。軍官似乎無需為了我們的觀察而去警醒沉睡中的山脈，但他要表示給我們看軍隊的力量。他們要表演一次軍事演習。</p>
<p>蔣委員長要向美國獲得飛行堡壘。有人說沒有地方可以使堡壘降陸，蔣氏立即下了一條手諭：在一百日之內趕造一飛機塲。一位畢業於伊立諾州大學的中國工程師担任這事的進行。這飛機塲預定造在成都。在四川省的十縣中每縣要抽調一萬人出來工作。（四川人口有五千萬，徵募十萬極為容易）十萬人在山徑中行走，成為一條黑綫，由成都四圍同向廣大的棕色平原進發。他們拿了自己縣份的旗幟一天一天奔赴市鎭，汚穢襤褸，像一支革命軍隊在行進中。每一縣的工人都派給一塊塲地工作。工程完畢，他們可以回家。十萬人拿了鐵剷，開始建造一千畝大的飛機塲。</p>
<p>這種偉大工程除金字塔和萬里長城之外，從來沒有見過。塲中塵砂飛揚，像戰爭時可怕的火烟。在遠處你就可以聽到鎚子敲在山石上的聲音，工人高聲的歌唱。旅幟在塵灰中飛揚，從上而下望，一片廣大的用勞力開拓的平原，與一片戰塲一樣，如螞蟻般的隊伍在推推拉拉，完成一片世界上最廣大的飛機塲。他們動用五千輛獨輪車，一千輛卡車，二十萬大筐，三萬五千柄鎚子。他們用脚混着水泥縱一哩遠的河床邊在背上負了石塊來。飛機塲完成後，跑道有一哩又八分之一闊。他們遵照委員長之囑，在一百天中造好。正如五百萬兵士在這難以攻陷的城中訓練，予以衣食，授以武器一樣，正如緬甸公路，中蘇公路的造成一樣，一切事情用決定的意志，把雙手去開拓，上面有靜默沉毅的委員長在指導策劃</p>
<p>中國必獲勝利。因為人民能繼都三次，把工廠機械，學校設備遷往山中安靜地帶；用民船和脚伕運輸軍需品到前綫；開鑿山洞，使無休止的轟炸不致傷及人命；不用機械幫助，百日內趕造一千畝大的飛機塲，當然可以忍受至最後勝利的。而時間之對於中國是不在乎的。四年的戰爭是可以說長期了，但假如你把歷史倒退四千年，也並不怎樣長。中國人天性有堅忍心，他們在出世時就學會忍耐。是的，時間在中國是不在乎的。</p>
<p>由汽油船逆溯至我們把貨車停下來的市鎭，巳行三十六小時。路上大雨滂沱，不可通行，貨車車輪要印在爛泥中。我們只能仍乘船赴韶關。馬君很樂觀的說，只要七小時就可到了。我們緩緩駛了半小時，忽然拖船繩索絆住了汽船推進機的葉子板。把舵者把引擎倒退，才把葉子板弄好。十八小時後我們望見了日軍在一年中不能炸毀的長橋。在旅館中我們又可在洋磁盆中洗澡，韶關看來是文化的中心了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c71">英籍平準委員抵滬　商給匯具體方案　霍爾巴樞昨晚自港到埠　與泰萊合作決完成使命　商人電請供給外匯一部已獲批准 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>中國外匯平凖基金委員會於本月十六日在渝第一次會議議決、推派來滬監督之英籍委員霍爾巴樞（E.　L.　Hall　Patch）、已於昨晚八時、自港搭輪來滬、中國國家銀行方面負責人士、均聯袂赴羅斯福碼頭迎接、并陪同霍氏驅車赴都城飯店下榻、霍氏乃英國遠東財政參贊、以原任央委羅傑士奉調赴香港政府任經濟顧問、始被聘繼任斯職、</p>
<p>具體方案卽將訂定</p>
<p>氏此次來滬如是之速、一方面因平準會之決議、另一方面則因駐滬美幫辦泰萊博士再三之敦促、其最殷切之來滬使命、顯為與泰萊合作、彙同上海英美商銀行及中中交農四行當局、訂定供給外匯之最具體方案、俾平凖委會及指定之中外銀行得通力合作、以一致行動、依照美匯五元三四三七五及英匯三辦士一八七五之價格、供給必需品外匯、達到消滅黑市之最高目的、完成運用平準基金之使命、至霍氏留滬久暫、尙未決定、唯其此來之任務、至重目鉅、故將與泰萊博士在滬作較長時期之躭留、以觀管理匯市實施之成效、并隨時予以指示也、</p>
<p>核准給匯基本原則</p>
<p>據新聲社記者昨日向關係銀行方面探得確悉、霍氏抵滬後將辦之第一件事、即為根據泰萊與銀行界方面協定之結匯基本原則、召集匯豐·花旗·麥加利·申央·中國·交通·及農民等銀行要員、作進一步之研究與考慮、按此一基本原則、即以外匯供給必需品之進口、唯為防止無限制供給影響蘇金起見、特將必需品分為重要次要及再次要三類、軍要項目全部供給、次要及再次要兩類、則酌給一部、他如規定禁止進口之貨品及近乎奢侈性質而不列入禁入範圍之內者、一律或有權全部拒絕供給、此一原則、不致有所改變、但所以尙須在霍氏抵滬後繼續商討者、徵求霍氏之意見、謀得更一致之通過與核准而巳、</p>
<p>結匯細則三項要點</p>
<p>關於結匯辦法之實施細則、即交由滬四行聯合處根據上述之基本原則擬定、其要點有三、（一）一九三九年七月海關公佈禁止輸入物品名單之充分實施、（二）二十九年九月行政院會議通過准予進口之必需品、應依照重要性分為三類（三）申請手續及申請外匯應備保證之規定、其中包括申請書·申請保證·審核標準·及辦理手續時期等、此種實施方法、於四行擬訂後、將交由各指定銀行一體辦理、同時、在出口商之結匯方面、已由當局規定、在出口貨物由他口岸運至上海轉口時、必須在該口岸先行結匯、至本市貨品出口之結匯、當竭力促使集中由中交兩行辦理、如結匯方法得圓滿調整、則黑市之「賣」可告戢止、</p>
<p>商人申請一部核准</p>
<p>字林西報云、香港平凖基金會電知、此間銀行對於商人電報申請供給外匯、已有一小部份獲得批准、此項消息傳出後、本埠外漸黑市塲頓呈堅挺之象、現自申請以迄邀准之期間、巳較前大為縮短、故各業商人爭奪外匯之緊張形勢、可望逐漸鬆弛、又查近來爭取外匯之緊張情勢、其另一原因、乃因在最近日內、將有大批棉花自巴西及美國裝運來滬、蓋現時棉花價格與棉紗行情、兩者間之參差、已使棉花進口成為極有利之交易、</p>

<h3 id="c97">孔子誕辰和敎帥節 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>八月二十七日，是孔子的誕辰，又是國定的銆節。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們該是知道的吧，孔子是我國的一位大敎育家。遠在二千四百多年以前，他就以「六藝」敎人。所謂六藝，就是禮。樂。射。御。書。數六種知能，正像現在我們所學的公民訓練。音樂、體育。勞作。書法。算術等科目。他有學生三千人，其中身通六藝的有七十二人。這是孔子「循循善誘一，「誨人不倦」的功效，所以後世尊他為「至聖先師」。</p>
<p>他的學說，以「仁」為主。對於家庭方面，以「孝，悌」為本；對於社會方面，以「忠，恕」為做人之道。他曾把詩。書。易。禮。樂。春秋等六種古書整理一下，增的增，刪的刪，遺傳於後世。</p>
<p>孔子沒有一定的先生，如古書所說，他「問官於郯子，問樂於萇弘，學琴於師襄，問禮於老聃。」他不恥下問，虛心受敎，所以成功一個博問多能的人。他又很崇拜堯舜，崇拜文王，武王，周公。他是常常夢見周公的。</p>
<p>說到敎師節，正如五一的「勞動節」，四四的「兒童節」，三八的「婦女節」一樣，都各有偉大的使命，各有重要的意義。它的歷史，是創於民國二十年，山敎師們自己發起，定六月六日為敎師節。目的是要改良敎師的待遇，保障敎師的地位，增進敎師的修養。每年的這一天，全國各地都有熱烈的慶祝。民國二十八年，政府才正式規定八月二十七日孔誕紀念為敎師節，各學校都放假慶祝。到今年，巳是第三屆的敎師節了。</p>
<p>現在以孔子誕辰定為敎師節，其意義尤加重大。因為孔子是萬世的師表，他的學問淵縛，道德高尙，是大家所欽佩的。他首開講學之風，不問身家，有敎無類，一般平民，都得有受敎育的機會。而且他能因材施敎，循循善誘，可為一般敎師的模範。所以把他的誕辰，作為全國的敎師節，不是最相宜嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們在這兩重的紀念下，一方面固然要效法孔子的好學廣問，孜孜不倦的精神，努力求學；一方面更應該尊敬你們的老師，以報答敎導你的恩澤！</p>
<h3 id="c98">開學了 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>在這幾天中，小朋友們大槪都要忙起來了，有的忙着補考有的忙着繳費，有的忙着購買課業用品，小朋友們能够這樣忙，眞是何等幸運，你們不見申報助學金運動，求助者的衆多，及他們求學之切和環境困苦的情形嗎？可是有些小朋友，不知機會的難得，而不肯努力求學，為什麼一個貧苦的孩子，往往能品學兼優而將來有所成就呢？並不是他們智力特別高，實在是他們能吃苦，能耐勞，古人說的「吃得苦中苦，方為人上人」的一句話是不錯的，他們更明白自己將來的責任，要獨立要生存，非得從磨難苦痛中鍜鍊出來不可。小朋友們處境優越，生活安適，可是求學萬不可貪懶取巧，一定要從苦讀苦幹中方能得到眞正的學問，切勿自暴自棄，奮力求進取，這是我開學時送給小朋友們的弟一點意思。</p>
<p>一個新階段的來臨，給人們一個自新的機會，新學期的開始，小朋友們不免有了新的希望，立了新的志向，定了新的計劃。在當初往往匯着一般熱誠，一團高興的做得很好，到了後來，又回復到以前的狀態，這原因除了沒有耐心外，</p>
<p>定是你的希望太切，志向太高，計劃太難，一時不易實現！就心灰意懶了。所以第二點我要告訴你們的，就是切切實實脚踏實地的去求學問，由近而遠，由容易的到困難的，不求近功，要有恒心的去達到你的志向，完成你的計劃。</p>
<p>第三點要告訴小朋友的，我們要保護書籍，愛惜課業用品，在這物價飛漲的時候，减少一筆經費，就是减輕父母的負擔，節省國家的活力。、</p>
<p>還有一點要小朋友在開學時知道的是不要死讀書，隨處是學識，我們要隨時注意，悉心研討，多讀報，參看書，充實我們的常識，擴展我們的眼光。</p>
<p>開學了，學校中來了新銆新同學，熙熙攘攘的多麼熱鬧啊，照着以上四點互相勉勵着，振作起精神，同心協力的開始工作吧。</p>

<p>猛　移居在鷹巢的附近對它說：</p>
<p>「以我的名字的權利，聽我說！」</p>
<p>「你要怎麼樣？」老鷹問。</p>
<p>「我要殺死你而吃你的肉。」</p>
<p>「你為甚麼要摧殘我呢？」</p>
<p>「你眞傻極了！我看你簡直毫無常識。我的巢太小所以我要你的；這樣我的孩子們纔有地方長大。此外我有我自己老鷲的政策，你講着不同的語言，你的思想也不順從我。」</p>
<p>「我所講的語言是上帝賜給我的。你能說得出我為甚磨要順從你的意志嗎？「</p>
<p>「我不知道，不過我只知道我有權利殺死和啖食無論那個反對我意見的東西，你就是要被殺和被食者之一。」</p>
<p>「那末我沒有法子逃脫這惡運麼？」</p>
<p>「我看恐怕不能够，不過你如能犧牲你自己，那對於你是很榮耀的。」</p>
<p>「告訴我，朋友，你從那裏學到這種思想？誰敎你的，」</p>
<p>「甚磨，你這蠢人」老鷲回答說：。「你難道不知道我會經在柏林動物園裏學習過南年嗎？」</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>——究竟為什麼？</p>
<p>烈日當空！酷暑方臨！人們又戴起了「白」草帽，穿起「白」紡綢，「白」萬載，江西萬載縣夏布）「白」皮鞋等等。除了戴「黑」色的太陽眼鏡之外，其餘都須借重「白」色！這是為什麼，一知牛解的，都說。「白」色凉，「黑」色熱。但我要重複一句問話、這：「究竟是為什麼？我們要知道：「白色拒熱」，和「黑色吸熱」的原理，烈日的照射，是「白」熱化！苟穿「黑「色衣服，戴「黑」色草帽，那麼因其吸熱，熱力便無孔不入，週身感受熱的威脅，而揮汗如雨，悶損殊甚。反之，穿「白色」的，便能「反射光熱」，將熱力回擊過去，在空氣的傳播中，全身便感覺到凉爽和舒適了。又心理上作用，見到「白色「覺得暢快，見到「黑色」，覺得厭惡，因為白雪之「白」，是純潔的，黑炭之「黑」，是汚濁的，「心定自然凉，」黑白分明，自也不無關係吧。</p>

<p>前星期日，阿　家做了好多的饅頭，而且做得很好，市上所買的饅頭不相上下，但是由自己來做，清潔得多、而　饅頭中的餡也可隨心所欲，有甜有鹹，不過使母親忙　　些、到得吃中飯時，拿來替代中飯，阿慧一口氣吃了五隻。覺得津津有味，這是難得吃到的緣故吧。</p>
<p>「媽媽，多吃了些麵食，也是挺好的，你瞧，北方人身强力壯，多吃了麵食，也是其中的一個原因，而且我們天天吃米飯，似乎吃得有些膩，而且米價又是這樣的責，不如掉掉花樣，換換口味，媽媽，我們每隔十天，吃一次饅頭好嗎？阿明這</p>
<p>母親也是個喜歡做做吃吃的，當然也答應了，並且自已故成的饅頭，成績眞不錯，鬆鬆而白白的，看二去就覺得很悅目，倒安慰了伊老人家不少的疲勞，並且把多餘下來的饅頭，送幾個給鄰家，更可表示出伊做饅頭的技衛很是高妙，因為鄰家也時常做饅頭，做一次總送來幾個讓他們嘗嘗，但終不及阿慧母親做的來得疏鬆，這樣，兩家似乎在舉行做饅頭比賽，那一家做得好？畢竟鄰家失敗了，便來請敎阿慧母親做饅頭的秘方，伊老人家也很願意的把其中的秘密拆穿了。原來做饅頭，是有一定的方法，用一定量的麵粉以及其他的附屬品，才能做成可口的饅頭，不然成績一定不會滿意的。</p>
<p>「做饅頭定要用酵母，我是向西式的伙食公司裏買來的，它外面有錫秕包着，活像一塊蔴姑豆腐乾，一寸多見方，現在價竟漲到兩角半一塊，用它來做饅頭最好，其他的發酵粉是不及它的。這樣的一塊酵母，可用麵粉兩斤，還要鹽牛茶匙，猪油，湯匙，白糖三湯匙和一些溫開水，這些是做饅頭必需的材料。然後把酵母溶在碗裏，用溫水調和，切不可用剛沸的開水。另用隻碗，成半碗溫水，把鹽，猪油，白糖調人，然後和酵母液一同混和。再把麵粉用細篩篩過，放在乾净的面盆裏，把酵母，混合液遂漸倒入調勻，根據麵塊的溫度，麵紛的多少隨時可增加，或减少，這時叫做濕麵，裏面的水分很多。過牛小時後，把濕麵倒在舖有乾麵粉的板上，加上些麵紛，用手揉揑，直到那濕麵柔軟而粘手為止，然後把揑成的麵塊放在面盆裏，上面用潔净的布遮住，放在溫暖的地方經過三小時，那麵槐會漲起來，竟漲成滿滿的一面盆，眞有趣，同時有些酒氣聞着，這時候便可把它包餡而製成各種式樣的饅頭，放在蒸籠裏，在沸水上蒸熟，那饅頭更發大起來，便變成疏鬆可口的了。你們是不是這樣做的？」伊老人家不怕對耐地說了這長長一大篇，而且還笑嘻嘻地似乎表示著伊是勝利了。</p>
<p>（註：由編者先生轉來小朋友徐國樑君的一封信，承詢做饅頭的方法，此篇即作為答覆。</p>

<p>— 新方</p>
<p>華生今天上常識課的時候，先生敎了一課新書，題目是「碳的同素異形體」，何謂同素異形體？同種的元素可以形成各種性質及形態互異的物體即謂同素異形體，如碳，硫，及氧等皆是。先生說：」碳的同素異形體有三種：一種即普通所見的炭，一種叫石墨，鉛筆的心是用石墨做的；另一種是被譽為世界上最寶貴的東西！金剛石。」華生聽到了「金剛石」三個字，覺得很是奇怪。金剛石的價值與炭相比實在是不可同日而語的。華生正在疑信參牛的時候，又聽得先生說：「如果把金剛石用極高極高的熱度加熱後，它是可以化成炭的。」</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！如果你讀到了這課新書，心中可會發生什麼感想嗎，金剛石與炭原來是同一種體物，這是可以給你一個極大的敎訓的！世上聰敏的人是「人」，愚蠢的人亦何嘗不是「人」呢；我們要做「金剛石」，却不要做「炭」，我以此語勉勵諸位，希望大家能夠一同來實踐！</p>

<p>— 洛綠</p>
<p>——他的愛人是梅眞——</p>
<p>在舞台上，徐立給人的印象是挺深刻的，無論演那一方面的角色，他從不肯馬虎，每一個戲裏，他的演技，總是很賣力而富於情感，可是正為如此，他在演「家」之後就病倒了。我們不是巳經好久沒有見到徐立在舞台上漏臉了嗎？有些人說徐立是退出話劇圈了，這是絕對不確的。昨天記者特地往訪徐立，他告訴我：「劇藝是我的第二生命，演戲是吾的終身事業，我將永遠的幹下去，決不會脫離舞台的。」現在所以不上台，是因為他的身體尚在休養期中，大槪不久他仍舊可以在劇藝社演出的。</p>
<p>徐立今年是二十四歲，沒有結婚——而且還沒有訂婚，不過他有一個愛人，就是現在天風演「清宮怨」中飾瑾妃的梅眞女士。他倆的認識還不過二年光景，可是他倆的戀愛却是已經到了相當的程度，在徐立的病中梅眞小姐差不多每天侍奉着的，你看，他倆多末「恩愛！」</p>
<p>梅眞本來的姓名是汪美珍，由阿巫的介紹，進了天風劇社，改名叫梅眞，只有二十歲，以前是中國女中的高材生，他對戲劇是非常的嗜好，當然，自從和徐君交友之後，對戲劇是更其的愛好了，不然，她怎麼會步着她情人的後塵，而亦踏上了舞台呢？梅眞的演技，大槪看過清宮怨的讀者們都知道，一個剛上舞台的姑娘，就能有着這一種爐火純青的演技，是很不容易的，大槪是徐立的「指導有方」罷！在天風的下一次公演中—淘金記—梅眞也有着重要的角色，我想，她的演技一定可比這一次更好，最後，我可告訴讀者，在不久的將來，徐立跟梅眞兩人就會有喜訊帶給我們，「梅眞將成為徐太太，是有十分之九。九的把握，」這是徐立自己告訴我的，徐先生，請別忘了請我喝喜酒！</p>

<p>第十五章　何處豪家强載歸</p>
<p>聰慧多智的圓圓，竟如熱鍋上的螞蟻，無處可避，無法可施，呆呆地木立着，一句話也不開口。圓圓的假母此刻又走上樓，先向田宏遇拜謝後，然後說追：「小女此番隨國丈老太爺去，目然稱心如意，百年和合。但據小女之意，最好稍緩一二日，略為料理一些家事，然後隨行。可否請國丈老太爺開恩俯允？」假母說十這幾句話，總算在圓圓而前有了一個交代，以免圓圓怪怨。圓圓趁勢也說道：「我母親的話就是我要說的話，務乞寬予兩天的期限，感德無量。」田宏遇還沒有回答，花蝴蝶早用他一雙狡猾的眼睛向假母和圓圓面上各各打量了一下，搶着說道：「一圓圓姑娘肯隨老大人同行，還有什麼事要料理？今天是個吉日，不可錯過。倘然有事，只消吩咐一聲，自有人代辦，一些也不用麻煩。須知國丈的光陰如同黃金，不是可以隨便躭擱時日的，今天國丈已預備一艘彩船，已靠門外，何必遲延呢？」田宏遇也說道：「高賢姪說得甚是，老夫實在不能多躭擱了。圓圓你快快隨我去吧，老夫一定不會待虧你的。「圓圓聽了他們的話，暗想完了完了，我的計劃巳告失敗了！恐怕詞人此時尙未知道呢。急得玉容變色，淚承於睫，又恐被他們瞧見，只得低倒螓首，默默無語。田宏遇要緊迎伊回去，不欲多坐，便頻頻催促圓圓動身。逼得圓圓上天無路，入地無門，不肯更衣換妝。花蝴蝶是個精靈鬼，他知道圓圓有些不願，恐防好事難諧，遂對田宏遇貶貶眼睛，以目示意。田宏遇便憑着樓窓向下面減一聲人來。跟着便有四名女婢四名家丁，一齊走上樓來。叫應了，站在一邊，聽候命令。（一五〇）</p>

<h3 id="e1">News of a U.S. Military Mission to China: Will Depart in a Few Weeks, Including Twelve Military Experts, to Assist Chairman Chiang in Planning Military Strategies <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>According to an Allied Press dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, obtained yesterday from Western sources in Shanghai, the "Times Herald" reports that a U.S. military mission, led by former U.S. Embassy Counselor in Peiping, General John Magruder, will depart for Chongqing within the next few weeks to assist Chairman Chiang in planning China's war strategy against Japan. The report states that President Roosevelt approved this matter shortly after his meeting with Prime Minister Churchill. The mission includes twelve military experts in various fields of warfare, and the number may be increased as needed. It is also stated that this matter was requested by Chairman Chiang himself, as China has had no foreign military advisors since the departure of the Germans from Chongqing.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd—Secretary of State Hull, at yesterday's press briefing, neither confirmed nor denied whether the U.S. plans to send a military mission to Chongqing. He stated that he could not comment before awaiting factual developments.</p>
<p>If the U.S. Becomes Involved in War Against Japan, Britain Will Automatically Declare War</p>
<p>United Press, London, 23rd—An authoritative source here stated yesterday that it is believed Churchill has assured President Roosevelt of a unique policy: should the U.S. become involved in war against Japan due to Japanese aggression, Britain will automatically declare war on Japan and support the U.S. with all possible military force. This news indicates that the cooperation among democratic nations in defending the Pacific has progressed significantly. Simultaneously, reliable British and American intelligence suggests strong confidence that Japan has decided to halt further southward advances in its military strategy.</p>
<p>United Press, Manila, 23rd—The associate editor of the American weekly magazine "Collier's," Mr. Gilfossi, arrived here yesterday on the "Anzac" clipper from Singapore. He stated that the Far East is indeed a powder keg, requiring only the slightest spark to ignite. He said, "The only question is when and where the match will be struck." He believes Thailand is closest to that point. "I believe Singapore cannot be taken by direct attack, but Singapore also lacks the strength to attack."</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 23rd—The Minister of Public Works of Burma, Mr. Chai Lawatiman, arrived here yesterday, stating that the situation in the Far East is indeed serious, but Burma is fully prepared. The minister is accompanied by Colonel Treiston, the health inspector of Burma, on a mission to study the procedures for civilian medical facilities in the defense of Malaya.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd—Senator Guffy, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, warned in a radio address last night that if the Axis powers win, the United States will be blockaded and economically starved. He stated that German and Japanese soldiers would cut off U.S. exports and imports of essential raw materials. He further stated, "If Singapore and other British bases fall, how can the United States obtain these goods? We now have a great navy, and will have an even stronger navy in the near future, but it would be foolish to pit it against the combined navies of Germany, Italy, and Japan."</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 23rd—Officials and the public here are quite apprehensive about possible international developments. The most pressing question in their minds is what is happening in the U.S.-Japan negotiations. Just as Britain and the U.S. are applying joint economic pressure on Japan, and the Chinese people are beginning to hope that democratic nations will finally recognize the need to take joint and active measures in the Pacific, news of U.S.-Japan negotiations has inevitably aroused feelings of disappointment. It is claimed that there must be some basis for these discussions, as it is known that fifteen meetings have already taken place. The recent announcement of British-Japanese correspondence procedures stems from the belief that Britain and the U.S. are once again negotiating with Japan to resolve the situation in the Far East after strong economic pressure. Many people believe that Britain and the U.S. may be discussing terms with Japan to detach it from the Axis camp and make some concessions in the Pacific. Although there are widespread rumors that American pilots and planes have arrived in China, according to Reuters, this is not very accurate. At the same time, the setbacks suffered by the Soviet Union on the European front and the news that the Soviet Union has concluded a border agreement with Japan have also aroused general concern as to whether democratic nations will once again attempt to appease Japan due to the deteriorating situation in the Soviet Union, in order to fully address the new threat from Germany.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Steadily Entering the Northeast: Rumored to be Preparing to Invade Siberia</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 23rd—It is learned that thousands of Japanese troops are now entering "Manchukuo" at the fastest possible rate. Some of these troops are being transferred from the Chinese front, while others are being transferred from the home country. Therefore, officials here are increasingly convinced that the Japanese army is about to invade Siberia. It is claimed that the troops transferred from the home country are newly mobilized troops, which proves that as soon as the Japanese army is fully concentrated, the Japanese military will strongly advocate launching an attack when attacking the Soviet Far East Army. It is estimated that the Soviet army has about thirty-five divisions, while the Japanese army currently stationed in Manchuria is around fifteen divisions. It is said that the Japanese believe that the Soviet army is likely to be driven back to the Ural Mountains. In this situation, Stalin will turn his attention to the Pacific and endanger Japan. Tokyo also predicts that as a result of Germany establishing a puppet regime in Moscow, Stalin's regime will inevitably collapse. If so, the powerful Soviet air force stationed in Vladivostok will also be a threat to Japan.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Lyon, 22nd—The Times today commented on the situation in the Far East, stating that opinions on the situation in the Far East are varied and inconsistent. Some predict that the situation in the Far East will become increasingly serious, while others believe that the situation has tended to ease. However, there is no doubt that both parties have taken precautionary measures to prepare for the worst. In fact, these precautionary measures are only part of the preparation and are not sufficient to prove that both parties have decided to resort to arms, let alone be comparable to action. Moreover, the Japanese and Soviet governments have not yet considered breaking off diplomatic relations so far.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd—Secretary of State Hull announced that an agreement has been reached with Japan on a gradual withdrawal of American nationals in Japan and Japanese nationals in the U.S. American nationals will be divided into several groups to travel from Japan to Shanghai, while Japanese nationals will also be divided into groups to return to Japan from the U.S.</p>
<p>United Press, Manila, 23rd—The High Commissioner's Office here today confirmed reports from Shanghai that all money and valuables of Japanese nationals were confiscated before they boarded the General Caffee liner to leave Manila. However, it stated that the Shanghai report claiming that the total amount confiscated was $50,000 was "an exaggeration."</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd—President Roosevelt yesterday designated Manila Bay as a "National Defense Sea Area" and ordered strict restrictions on navigation. The presidential order was published in the Federal Register, dated August 16th. The order stated that all territorial waters, nearby waterways, and tributaries of Manila Bay are established and reserved for national defense purposes. Those wishing to enter the bay should contact us before departure or by wireless before arriving at the bay.</p>
<h3 id="e4">New U.S. Tank: Hundreds Shipped to Britain, Showing Superiority in Egypt; Roosevelt Refutes Senator's Remarks <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, 23rd—President Roosevelt, when hosting reporters yesterday, corrected the criticism of delayed production of defense supplies made by Democratic Senator Byrd. He said that he had instructed the Army Department to investigate and found that all of Byrd's statements, except for those regarding aircraft, were incorrect. Byrd said that not a single tank had been shipped to Britain, but in fact, hundreds of new tanks had already been shipped to Britain, and some had been transferred to Egypt, where newspapers have praised their excellent performance. Byrd said that the original procedure only stipulated an average monthly delivery of four 90mm anti-aircraft guns, but in fact, according to the procedure, an average of 61 guns per month must be delivered in the coming months of this year. The Army Department believes that it can definitely be implemented as such. Byrd said that only 15 37mm flat-trajectory guns were produced per month, but in fact, 72 flat-trajectory guns were produced in July, 160 will be produced in August, 260 in September, and 320 in October. Byrd said that only 15 81mm mortars were produced in previous months, but in fact, the production of this item was 221 in July and will be 340 in August, and will increase even more in September and October. Byrd's figures for aircraft did correspond to the facts, but his claim that the production of military aircraft gradually decreased in the past three months of May, June, and July was not entirely true. In fact, the production of training aircraft has indeed increased, while the production of military aircraft has remained the same, because the design has been changed repeatedly, and the new aircraft must be tested to suit the lessons learned this spring. He knew that the number of aircraft produced in July was 1,465, while the previous estimate was 1,500. Anyone who wants to know accurate information may inquire with the Production Management Bureau. In short, all of Byrd's claims, except for aircraft, are incorrect, and this is a fact.</p>

<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 23rd—President Roosevelt yesterday ordered an increase in the import tax on crab meat by 7.5 percent. This is another economic blow to Japan, as Japan is the main country importing crab meat into the United States. This order makes the total value of the crab meat import tax 22.5 percent. From now on, Japan's crab fishing and canning industry will suffer a direct blow. The President's order did not conceal its direct background against Japan. Before issuing the order, the President discussed the matter with the public, saying that he believed Japan maintained a huge crab fishing industry near the coast of Alaska.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 23rd—The Board of Trade today issued an order, effective Tuesday, prohibiting the export of all goods to China, the Pacific, Japanese-controlled islands, and Macau, except for those holding permits. The Board of Trade stated that the order does not apply to goods transported to China via the Burma Road (along the Yunnan-Burma Road) via Rangoon. The Board of Trade's order is intended to prevent Japanese trade in occupied China, not to target Free China.</p>

Regarding the former, it is rumored that Hitler has withdrawn four motorized divisions from the Soviet front and concentrated them in southern Bulgaria, pressuring Turkey to accept two points: one, to allow German troops to pass through Anatolia to directly access Syria, Iraq, Iran, and even the Transcaucasus; two, to allow the Italian fleet to enter the Black Sea via the Dardanelles to assist German forces in dealing with the Soviet navy. Regarding Iran, on the one hand, there is a German fifth column filled in various important locations, and on the other hand, there is a joint warning from Britain and the Soviet Union to the Tehran government, demanding the expulsion of German nationals and allowing Britain to pass through Iran to aid the Soviet Union. Yesterday, there were even rumors that General Wavell, commander of the British Indian Army, had led his troops into Iranian territory via Balochistan.</p>
<p>That the European war will inevitably affect Asia Minor and the Middle East was well known to the world as early as the Greek resistance in the spring and the subsequent incidents in Iraq and Syria. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, people generally felt bewildered by Turkey's failure to learn from the experiences of the defeated European countries, stubbornly clinging to the so-called neutral policy, and at the same time, they were somewhat disappointed that Britain did not take further action in the Near East after the end of the Syrian incident to echo the heroic resistance of the Red Army. Specifically speaking, if the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union had succeeded quickly, its next step would inevitably have been to pressure Turkey into "cooperation" in order to gain access to the Near East. Conversely, if the blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union encountered setbacks, then to remedy the situation, it would inevitably seek another way out in Asia Minor. The Turkish government knew that regardless of the outcome of the German-Soviet war, it would be ravaged by the Nazis one day, so why didn't it make a decisive decision early on, and had to wait until the German army concentrated its efforts to attack Ukraine, seeing the soldiers approaching the gates of the country today, before rushing to deal with it? Similarly, Britain, after the two lessons of Iraq and Syria, should have long realized that the corner of the Near East had become the target of Nazi fifth column activities. Before Germany actually invaded the Soviet Union, it could be said that it was concerned about stimulating Moscow, so it was willing to "live in peace." Now that the Red Army has been resisting independently for more than two months, although Britain is shouting for aid on the one hand and promising joint action on the other, in fact, apart from the air force launching attacks on Japan, there has been almost no movement in other areas. Even the African front, which was originally in combat, is almost in hibernation. It was not until recently, after the German army intensified its attack in Ukraine and achieved considerable results, that Britain was heard to be busy issuing warnings due to the discovery of Nazi elements in Iran. In fact, in the early stages of the German-Soviet war, Britain should have completed the necessary arrangements in Asia Minor and the Near East, both militarily and diplomatically. At the very least, it should have launched a counterattack in some places that had not been occupied for long by the enemy and where the local animosity had not completely disappeared—such as Thessaloniki in Greece—in order to echo the Red Army. Even if it was unsuccessful, at least strategically, it could achieve the dual results of restraining some Nazi forces and encouraging the morale of the Red Army. Of course, to carry out this counterattack, it would certainly be more certain to win if Turkey's cooperation could be obtained in advance. However, as mentioned earlier, the purpose of this side war is only to restrain the enemy, harass the enemy, and make the German army attacked from both sides. Therefore, it does not need to triumph immediately in fact. If one landing fails, you can follow with a second. If it is not easy to succeed here, you can find weaknesses elsewhere. Such constant attacks make the enemy exhausted to deal with. At the same time, the Near East countries should be given absolute control. It can be transported to aid the Soviet Union, and it can relieve the Red Army of its worries. If it is not too late to consolidate the rear until the German army has arrived on the Black Sea coast, or even when it is pressuring the Ankara government, at least it has been "twice the effort."</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the democratic front can no longer hesitate about the situation in the Near East at this time, and must act decisively and quickly. At the same time, the two countries in question, Iran and Turkey, should take the countless weak and small invaded countries that have been defeated one by one as a warning. Assuming that they do not distinguish between friends and enemies and willingly degenerate, then undoubtedly, Turkey will become the second Bulgaria, and Iran will be worse than Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Three U.S. Highway Experts</p>
<h3 id="e10">Complete Inspection of the Yunnan-Burma Road: Submit Recommendations to Chairman Chiang: Establish Four Agencies such as Patrol Department and Vehicle Administration Office to Manage the Road's Equipment and Transportation Matters; Transportation Volume Can be Increased if Recommendations are Adopted <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing—Three U.S. freight and highway experts, before leaving here last night for Hong Kong and returning to the United States, told the press, "The Yunnan-Burma Road is not a freight problem, but an urgent problem. If half of our recommendations are adopted, the road's traffic can be increased by 200 to 300 percent." The three experts are Mr. Arnstein, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Helman. They conducted a rigorous inspection of the Yunnan-Burma Road and its transportation equipment, and only returned to Chongqing last week to submit a detailed report to Chairman Chiang and other important government officials. Government officials enthusiastically adopted their report and recommendations and have begun to implement them. Mr. Arnstein, the leader of the three, said, "I have lost 20 pounds, but I feel that we have completed a good job. The Yunnan-Burma Road should soon begin to truly carry goods." The detailed content of their report and recommendations has not been released, but it is understood that their general plan is to establish four agencies to manage the road and traffic: one is an effective military police patrol department, the second is a unified traffic system, and radio will be used to maintain constant contact with various locations. In addition, there are road maintenance offices and vehicle administration offices. All government transport vehicles on the road will be operated by the vehicle administration office, rather than independently by various government agencies. Mr. Arnstein said, "We insist that the final solution to this problem should be purely Chinese. At present, experienced American managers, technicians, and mechanical experts will temporarily assist in organizing and guiding the Chinese who are in charge of important positions on how to operate the plan. Thirty-five such experts have already left the United States for China and will soon arrive in Chongqing. The leader of this group is Lieutenant Wilson, who is currently the U.S. Assistant Military Attaché to China. He is a reserve officer and was originally the manager of a large freight company in New York State. He was recently called up for service and has been appointed as the director of the Vehicle Administration Office. Ninety percent of the transport vehicles traveling on the Yunnan-Burma Road will be managed by the Vehicle Administration Office, and many new transport vehicles will soon arrive in China under the Lend-Lease Act." Mr. Arnstein acknowledged that some of the minor recommendations they made during the inspection of the road have already been implemented and have had good results in increasing traffic. He said, "One more thing that made our work smooth and gave me confidence in the results was the Chinese we encountered. From Chairman Chiang down, they all cooperated fully with us. They are eager to complete this important undertaking, and they are prepared to proceed quickly, regardless of whether it is appropriate." Chairman Chiang expressed his willingness for them to stay here to implement their recommendations during their last meeting, but the three felt that they had completed their mission here. However, Mr. Arnstein stated that he would come again if the plan encountered obstacles. He said, "None of the businesses I have handled has ever failed, and this time will be no exception. I have told them that if things do not proceed according to plan within six months, I will come back to investigate the reasons." When asked if Japanese bombing could shut down the road, he replied that it was impossible and said, "The road's traffic may be suspended for a short period of time only when the Japanese are able to destroy all the bridges, but according to our observations, this situation is extremely unlikely to occur." He also said that even if the bridges are hit, traffic will not be stopped, but he did not want to reveal the details of this statement. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Chongqing—This year's Higher Education Examinations were previously scheduled to begin on September 15 in ten locations: Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, Taihe, Lishui, Yong'an, Luoyang, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. The preliminary examinations for nine categories—general administrative personnel, financial administrative personnel, economic administrative personnel, educational administrative personnel, diplomats and consuls, statisticians, accounting and auditing personnel, health administrative personnel, and construction personnel (divided into civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgical engineering, agronomy, and horticulture)—are now being postponed to September 22, according to sources in the Examination Yuan authorities. This is due to the fact that the examination area is too wide this year, and in extraordinary times, air raids are frequent and transportation is very difficult. In order to prevent postal delays that may interfere with the examination process and to facilitate candidates' registration, the registration deadline has been extended to September 7. All registration matters in Chongqing will be handled directly by the Examination Commission, and in other places, they will be entrusted to the local provincial education departments (23rd).</p>

<h3 id="e16">War Committee Announces A Week's Operational Overview <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>August 15th to 22nd</p>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the weekly war situation, the War Committee spokesperson discussed the war situation for this week (August 15th to 22nd). The Air Force continued to conduct bombings in the rear areas of China. Anti-aircraft artillery in various parts of China shot down a Japanese squadron leader aircraft in Wanxian on the 15th, killing the Japanese unit commander Yokota and four others. On the 19th, a Japanese aircraft was shot down in Zhongxian, killing the four pilots.

<p>Southern Henan: The Japanese army in Xinyang gathered more than 5,000 troops and began harassing the area on the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, they advanced from Muyou River, Wujia Village, Chenjia Village, towards Chashan, Pingchang Pass, Gucheng, Xueshan, and Shenyangtai, where they were met by Chinese troops who fought back along multiple routes. The fighting was fierce, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties without making any progress. Therefore, they changed their strategy and, in addition to using a portion of their forces to harass Zhulinzong via Wujia Village and Yangjia River in an attempt to contain our forces, launched a full-scale attack on Shenyangtai, Xiangshan, and other places on the morning of the 11th. The Chinese army launched a pincer attack from the front and rear, finally repelling the Japanese on the evening of the 12th. The portion of the Japanese army that attacked Zhulinzong was also repelled by the Chinese army, and the remnants fled towards the Xiang River and Xinyang. The Chinese army pursued their victory, and by the 13th, the original situation had been restored. It is estimated that 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle, and a large number of spoils of war were captured.</p>
<p>Northern Hubei: On the afternoon of the 13th, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on Suixian and encountered the Japanese army at Wangjiataizi in the western suburbs. The fighting raged through the night, and several miles of the road around Leigudun were destroyed. On the evening of the 15th, they launched another attack on the Japanese army at Duchong Mountain in the southern suburbs of Suixian, killing many Japanese sentries and capturing the advantageous terrain of Gaomiao. The Japanese then sent reinforcements, and the fighting lasted until dawn on the 16th. That night, the Chinese army again launched a surprise attack on Suixian city from multiple directions, with one force charging into the South Gate and another attacking the East Gate.

<h3 id="e17">Anglo-Soviet Rivalry with Germany – Serious Situation in the Near East – Nazi Expansionism as a Source of Calamity – Britain and the Soviet Union Express Dissatisfaction with Iran’s Response <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: It was learned last night that the Iranian government’s response to the British memorandum of August 16th has been delivered to the British Minister to Iran, Sir Reader Bullard. London has now received this response and is considering it. According to an American broadcaster in Ankara, reliable sources in Tehran’s diplomatic circles indicate that Iran’s formal written response to Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the expulsion of German nationals from Iranian territory is as unsatisfactory as the previous verbal reply. It still argues that the British and Soviet claims that Germany threatens Iran’s independence are unfounded. However, it is reported that Iran has agreed to expel a small number of Germans, but it is not clear whether those to be expelled are Germans holding key positions.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that London has now received Iran’s response and is considering it. It was previously reported that the Iranian authorities’ verbal response to the British note, which pointed out the increased use of German personnel in Iranian ministries, was not of a nature that would satisfy Britain. It is not yet known what the nature of the formal response is, but Britain initially urged the Iranian government to pay attention to the serious crisis posed by the German fifth column in Iran. At that time, the Iranian authorities seemed to be downplaying the matter, and their claim that several Germans had already left the country clearly indicated their hope that the matter could be dropped. This kind of lukewarm attitude, whether genuine or not, is unacceptable to Britain, a point that Britain has made clear in its second note. It is obvious that Germany wants to use Iran as a tool, in the same way it did with Iraq and Syria, leading to unnecessary bloodshed. Britain and the Soviet Union have no designs on Iran’s sovereignty, and the eight principles in the Atlantic Charter prove that British policy is disinterested. The Soviet Union also welcomes the formal declaration of these eight principles and has no territorial ambitions. British policy will be guided by these considerations, and there will be no measures to trample on the Iranian people or Iranian sovereignty, but only to prevent Iran from being dominated by German conspiracies. Germany, concerned about the attitudes of Britain and the Soviet Union, is doing its utmost to propagandize in an attempt to salvage the situation. However, Britain and the Soviet Union have a complete understanding of what attitude should be adopted on this issue.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 22nd: The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" of Zurich reports that its correspondent in London writes that public and official attention in Britain is now focused on the situation in Iran. The Foreign Office is currently studying the Iranian government's response. It is generally believed that Germans who have infiltrated Iran hold extremely important positions and pose a major threat to the interests of the Allied nations. In addition, the "Zürcher Tagesanzeiger" reports that its correspondent in Berlin writes that, according to general German impressions, the pressure exerted by Britain and the Soviet Union on Iran has recently increased significantly. However, Iran will not succumb to this pressure and will continue to pursue a policy of neutrality. In short, the military plan formulated by the British Middle East Command is bound to be affected by the current tough attitude of the Iranian government. Therefore, it is expected that a serious situation will soon develop in the Near East.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: A diplomatic correspondent for "The Times" writes that in the notes exchanged between Britain and Iran in recent weeks, Britain's concern has only been to ensure that Germans will not be allowed to exploit Iran as they have other countries. Among the many countries where German influence has infiltrated, Iran is now the only country where the power of the government has been undermined by German secret agents and is a source of calamity for all its neighbors. Because Iran lies across the route from the Near East to India and the Indian Ocean to the Soviet Union, Britain and the Soviet Union cannot but express particular concern about German activities within Iran. Over the past three or four days, there have been many rumors around the world about future Anglo-Soviet actions, most of which have been fabricated by Germany, which is eager to know whether its latest conspiracy has been successful. While Germany's eagerness to know Britain's intentions is natural, all these rumors clearly contain malicious intent at a time when London is considering the Iranian government's response.</p>
<p>Iran Determined to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: Iranian Minister to the United States, Ghaffar Jalal Alai, stated yesterday after meeting with Secretary of State Cordell Hull that Iran will resist aggression from any quarter, even if its forces are weak and outnumbered, and will not yield even if the enemy is a thousand times stronger. There are approximately 700 German residents in Iran, and there is no fifth column within the country. No visas have been issued to German travelers for the past two years, and the German residents in Iran, like other foreigners, are subject to careful surveillance. Iranians believe that maintaining neutrality is beneficial to their neighbors, especially Britain.</p>
<p>Britain Denies Sending Troops to Iran</p>
<p>Havas, London, 22nd: The rumor that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of British forces in India, has led troops from Balochistan into Iran has been denied by responsible sources. However, it is said that the conditions previously proposed by Britain and the Soviet Union to the Iranian government are unlikely to be fully accepted, as the verbal response from the Iranian government has already created a bad impression. Therefore, the British government is now considering "strong action" to eradicate German influence in Iran and expel German technical personnel from the country. If this cannot be achieved peacefully, Britain is prepared to send troops to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>United States Monitoring Developments</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd: The United States is closely monitoring developments in the Near East. Secretary of State Hull told the Iranian minister that, on the instructions of President Roosevelt, he denied rumors circulating in London that the United States would endorse Anglo-Soviet military action against Iran.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 22nd: When President Roosevelt hosted the press this month, a reporter asked whether it was true that the policy pursued by Britain towards Iran had been agreed to by President Roosevelt personally, as claimed by Britain. The President replied that this news was completely unfounded, but that the fact that British newspapers still enjoyed freedom of speech was clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>Axis Powers Secretly Active in Bulgaria</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 22nd: The rumor that many Italian officers and soldiers have arrived in southeastern Bulgaria, especially in the Thracian region of the lower Maritsa River, has been officially denied. It is said that there are only fifty members of the Italian Youth Association residing in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, Sofia, 23rd: The German Minister to Bulgaria, Becker, met yesterday with several Macedonian freedom fighters. These individuals had been sentenced in 1927. The Deputy Mayor of Skopje, representing the citizens, thanked the Minister and asked him to convey their gratitude to Hitler.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 22nd: Political figures here recently discussed the increasing tension in relations between Britain and Iran, attributing it to the dissatisfaction of British officials with the response submitted by the Iranian government. According to the press here, if Britain and the Soviet Union decide to violate Iran's neutrality, they will inevitably encounter strong resistance. In other words, any attempt to cross Iranian territory by force will not be easy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">India’s Participation in the War Effort – 700,000 Armed and Ready – Demands for Post-War Autonomy Guaranteed – Political Stalemate Persists <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 23rd: The political stalemate in India continues. The two major political parties, the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, have so far refused to accept the Viceroy's invitation to join the government. At the same time, the establishment of the National Defence Council has complicated the situation for the Prime Minister of Punjab, Khizr Hayat Khan Tiwana; the Prime Minister of Bengal, A. K. Fazlul Huq; the Prime Minister of Assam, Muhammad Saadulla; and other key members of the Muslim League who have accepted positions as members of the Council to promote India’s war effort. This is because the President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, has stated that their actions are contrary to the policy already announced by the League and has proposed that they be punished. The three provincial Prime Ministers have countered that their actions are in no way contrary to the League's policy, and the Viceroy has invited them to join the National Defence Council in their capacity as Prime Ministers, not as members of the League. At the same time, the Indian National Congress's opposition to the war remains unchanged. The Secretary of the Congress stated that Gandhi is very satisfied with the progress of the civil disobedience movement being carried out "according to plan." In addition, the newly formed Sapru Committee, which accepts the principle of expanding the Viceroy's Executive Council, is actively advocating for the immediate transfer of the four ministerial portfolios of Defence, Home Affairs, Communications, and Finance to Indians. Meanwhile, the Sikhs and lower castes are now demanding representation on the Viceroy's Executive Council, while the President of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar, who welcomed the Viceroy’s plans to expand and establish the National Defence Council, has telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt to ask whether the recent joint declaration issued by Britain and the United States also applies to the future status of India, and whether the United States will guarantee India freedom and equal status one year after the end of the war. Currently, the various princely states of India are making every effort to participate in India's war effort, contributing significantly in terms of manpower and resources. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, recently announced in a broadcast that approximately 750,000 Indians are now armed.</p>

<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 23rd: A Berlin dispatch from the Swedish Social Democratic newspaper reports that German diplomatic negotiations with Turkey aim to obtain Turkey's position regarding the exact position it will take should peace in the Near East (meaning Iran) be disrupted. As things stand, neither Germany nor Turkey wants to conclude a military treaty. The correspondent also said that if Iran makes concessions to the Soviet Union or Britain, Turkey will be surrounded but can obtain assistance from Germany and Italy. The only way to ensure such assistance is for Turkey to allow German and Italian troops to transit through its territory.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 23rd: British First Lord of the Admiralty A. V. Alexander stated in a broadcast last night that the Allied navies now have 190 warships, including about 50 French ships, operating alongside the British Navy. These Allied forces are not merely for show, but are a powerful fleet that has come to our aid in times of crisis. These 190 warships are manned by approximately 16,000 personnel, all of whom are undertaking a share of the arduous responsibilities, such as escorting convoys, minesweeping, and anti-submarine patrols. Many of the Allied warships are destroyers, submarines, and small craft. The Netherlands has 50 ships, including one cruiser; Free France also has 50 ships; Norway has 59 ships; and Poland also has over 10 ships, all of which have braved all difficulties to sail to Britain to fight for a common cause. The Allied merchant fleet totals approximately 7.25 million tons, of which Free France, Belgium, and Poland account for approximately 750,000 tons, Greece approximately 1 million tons, the Dutch fleet 480 ships totalling 2.25 million tons, and the largest is the Norwegian merchant fleet with 720 ships totalling approximately 3.25 million tons.

<h3 id="e28">The Soviet-German War Enters Its Third Month: The Northern Front's Battles are Unprecedentedly Fierce, Germany's Offensive Against Leningrad Makes No Progress, and the Red Army is Ordered to Defend Odessa Port to the Death. <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Special Dispatch) – Day and night, and on the morning of the 20th, our troops continued to fight the enemy on all fronts. The battles at Gomel in the central sector, Kingisepp in the northern sector, and Novgorod were particularly fierce.</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Reuters) – Yesterday marked the beginning of the third month of the Soviet-German war. Fierce fighting continued on all fronts. Both Berlin and Moscow reviewed the war situation yesterday to commemorate the start of the third month of the war. Soviet communiqués stated that in the first two months of the war, the German side suffered an estimated 2 million casualties, 8,000 tanks, and 7,700 aircraft. The Soviet side also suffered 150,000 deaths, 440,000 injuries, and 110,000 missing, totaling 700,000 casualties, and lost 5,500 tanks, 7,500 artillery pieces, and 4,500 aircraft. Moscow was attacked 24 times, resulting in 436 deaths and over 1,000 injuries, but military targets were not damaged.</p>
<p>The German review only mentioned the three major battles in the northern, central, and southern Ukraine sectors, but apart from a few details, the rest was the same as what the Soviet side had already announced. Regarding the German offensive against Leningrad, a Berlin spokesman only stated that the German occupation of Kingisepp and Novgorod had shortened the Soviet defense line. Furthermore, with the fall of Novgorod, the German right wing had secured a base for advancing on the road between Leningrad and Moscow. In the central sector, the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Gomel, and the area between the Berezina River and the mouth of the Pripyat River would soon fall into German hands. The Berezina River flows into the Dnieper River about 125 miles west of Gomel, while the Pripyat River flows into the Dnieper River 95 miles to the south. The Nazi spokesman concluded that the current German operations had created a situation favorable for future developments, but the German forces would likely encounter many difficulties due to the strong Soviet resistance.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) – A communiqué from the German-Romanian Joint Command announced that the Soviet command had ordered the holding of Odessa at any cost. All the city's sailors, workers, and men of all ages had hastily formed units to join the fighting. The communiqué also stated that the city had been completely surrounded, and after fierce fighting, the main Soviet defense line had been breached, with a large number of weapons and Soviet soldiers captured.</p>
<p>Soviet Flying Squads are Exceptionally Active, Disrupting German Rear Communications</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (United Press) – News from the front lines indicates that the "Flying Squads" of the Soviet army are now operating behind German lines, launching fierce attacks on the western front and causing significant disruption. The report states that well-equipped liaison teams are cutting off communications along the front lines and destroying food, fuel, and ammunition depots, before rejoining the main forces to continue fighting the Germans.</p>
<p>The Valiant Fighting of the Soviet Red Army Deeply Impresses Romanian Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>Bucharest, 22nd (Havas) – Two months have passed since Romania declared war on the Soviet Union. Although Bessarabia and Bukovina have been recovered and the German-Romanian forces are advancing on the port of Odessa, the Red Army's resistance is seemingly endless, and its advances and retreats are well-organized and orderly, which was beyond expectations here. Romanians had believed that the Red Army would collapse within weeks after a hard fight, and that low morale in the rear would exacerbate internal chaos, leading to the eventual disintegration of the Bolshevik regime. In reality, such hopes are, at least, premature. The Stalin regime currently shows no signs of wavering. Moreover, Romanian officers and soldiers returning from the front unanimously praise the bravery of the Red Army, with some even admiring them as heroes. The fact that the port of Odessa remains unyielding despite attacks from land and air forces shows that this is no exaggeration. Furthermore, the daily lists of fallen officers and soldiers published by the government reveal the heavy losses suffered by the Romanian army. It is generally believed that once the port of Odessa is captured, a large part of the Romanian army will be transferred back to the country for rest and replenishment.</p>
<p>The Soviet People are United, Determined to Defend Leningrad with All Their Might</p>
<p>Leningrad, 23rd (TASS) – The call by Voroshilov in Leningrad to the people to defend the city has received widespread response. Leningrad is now in a precarious situation, with fascist troops gradually creeping closer. The people in the city are serious and calm, with high morale, and are waiting for the enemy, determined not to let them enter Leningrad. Rallies are being held in factories and parks, and workers unanimously express their unwavering determination to defend Leningrad. A resolution by the workers of the Kirov factory stated, "We will rise up together to defeat the enemy and defend Leningrad." Outstanding workers from various factories have joined the National Guard, determined to defend Leningrad at the cost of their lives. Eight hundred wives and mothers of workers also held a meeting, with Konstantinova stating, "The enemy will repeat the mistakes of twenty-two years ago and dig their own graves outside Leningrad." Leningrad has now become a huge military camp, with armed workers' teams drilling in the squares day and night. Every factory has become a strong fortress. Workers are joining the National Guard and fighting alongside the Red Army to defend their city, family honor, and freedom.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 22nd (Havas) – The fighting for Leningrad in the northern sector is expected to intensify in the coming days. The city's radio station is urging residents to take up arms and defend the city every day, but the threat to Leningrad is not yet at a critical stage. After the German forces occupied Novgorod and Kingisepp, Leningrad did not feel an immediate crisis. The German forces are likely launching these offensives due to the climate, otherwise, if they wait another month, Leningrad will be covered in heavy snow, and the fighting will have to be postponed until next spring. The Red Army is well aware of this and seems to want to take advantage of the weather to secure the situation. The main German forces are currently concentrated between Lakes Peipus and Ilmen, preparing for a major battle. The Red Army has established strong positions on both banks of the Luga and Volkhov Rivers. The German forces are currently trying to link up with the Finnish forces advancing from the south, aiming to encircle Leningrad completely. If this is achieved, the assault on the city can be delayed until next spring. In the southern sector, after the German forces occupied Gomel, the Red Army launched a strong counterattack, and the two sides are still stalemated. Fierce fighting has been raging around the Black Sea port of Odessa for several days, with the sky lit up by fires. The German forces seem determined to capture it, but military observers generally believe that the German offensive in Ukraine has not progressed according to schedule. The German forces currently only occupy the entire Ukrainian region west of the Dnieper River, and Odessa is not included. Looking at the overall situation on the front lines in the past two months, the German offensives in the northern, central, and southern sectors, although fierce, have not achieved any major breakthroughs. The Soviet Union seems to have inexhaustible manpower and resources to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Three German Transport Ships Sunk Near the Romanian Coast</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Reuters) – A report from the "Battlefield" section of the Soviet official TASS news agency stated that Soviet aircraft reconnaissance near the Romanian coast spotted enemy troops, artillery, and ammunition being loaded onto enemy transport ships. A squadron of Soviet bombers was ordered to fly to the location and, descending to an attack altitude, dropped heavy bombs amid intense anti-aircraft fire from the enemy ships. During the second attack by the Soviet aircraft, one ship was seen engulfed in flames, and the bow of another ship had sunk. The Soviet aircraft carried a large number of bombs and carried out three attacks in total. Another large enemy transport ship was sunk, and several other ships were hit and fled towards the coast. The Soviet aircraft returned safely to the airfield after dropping all their bombs.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Soviet Communiqué Reviews Achievements of the Past Two Months; Germany Pays a Heavy Price <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (TASS) – The results of the past two months of the Soviet-German war are as follows: The result of the Red Army's two months of fighting against the invading Hitlerite troops has proven that the German command's plan to "annihilate" the Red Army with a blitzkrieg has completely failed. Just a month ago, the German command was still declaring to the world that the German army had opened roads to Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv, but in fact, these roads have been blocked by our army, and dozens of German fascist divisions have been defeated by the Red Army. The facts of the past two months prove that the Red Army has not been annihilated and is becoming stronger every day. Although the enemy has occupied some cities, they have paid a great price and suffered heavy losses in terms of manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>In the past three weeks, the Red Army has crushed more than 60 German divisions: (1) 12 tank divisions, including the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 18th, and 19th divisions; (2) 27 infantry divisions, including the 5th, 11th, 24th, 26th, 28th, 30th, 32nd, 44th, 50th, 52nd, 62nd, 68th, 71st, 79th, 86th, 94th, 95th, 99th, 101st, 106th, 110th, 111th, 121st, 125th, 137th, 156th, 157th, 161st, 206th, 253rd, 26th, 263rd, 290th, 293rd, 297th, 298th, and 299th divisions; (3) 8 motorized divisions, including the 2nd, 8th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 20th, 25th, and 27th motorized divisions; (4) 3 SS divisions, including the 3rd, 11th, and 30th divisions; (5) 17 infantry regiments from various divisions, including the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 29th, 135th, 255th, 260th, 268th, 279th, 307th, 311th, 312th, 462nd, 480th, 485th, 486th, and 530th regiments, as well as the "Deutschland" and "Wiking" regiments. In addition, some divisions have been virtually annihilated, with each division having only ten to twelve men left. As a result of two months of fighting, German officers and soldiers have suffered 2 million casualties, including those killed, wounded, and captured. Equipment losses have been equally significant. According to accurate statistics, in the past two months, Germany has lost 8,000 tanks, 10,000 artillery pieces, and 7,200 aircraft. The Red Army has suffered 150,000 killed, 440,000 wounded, and 110,000 missing, totaling 700,000 casualties. In addition, it has lost 5,500 tanks, 7,500 artillery pieces, and 4,500 aircraft.</p>
<p>The Red Army's strong resistance has shattered the myth of the German army's invincibility. The Red Army still possesses enormous strength and will not cease its resistance until the enemy is annihilated. From this, it can be seen that the two months of war have proven the following facts: (1) Hitler's plan to end the war in six weeks has completely failed. It is clear that the war will be prolonged, and the heavy losses suffered by the German army will accelerate the collapse of Hitlerism. (2) The fall of some cities does not affect the Red Army's continued resistance until the German army is annihilated. (3) Germany's manpower and material resources will be exhausted, and its international position will deteriorate. However, the Red Army has gained allies, and its strength is increasing day by day. History proves that countries and armies that increase their strength during wartime will win, while those that weaken during wartime will fail.</p>
<h3 id="e30">German Volunteers Called Up for Enlistment in Preparation for a Protracted War <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (United Press) – Berlin newspapers yesterday published a proclamation calling up volunteers aged seventeen to forty-five to fill the ranks of the armed SS. Authoritative sources deny that this call-up is due to the high casualties on the Eastern Front. The proclamation also describes the glorious mission of the SS, stating that it has recently been at the forefront of the fight against Bolshevism. Authoritative sources say that this call-up is purely for technical purposes, to give young people and adults of military age the opportunity to join the army. Well-informed sources say that the term of service in the SS is twelve years, and those whose term has not expired when the war ends will be reassigned to police service. However, the current call-up is only to increase the number of recruits to meet the needs of a long war.</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (TASS) – The Red Star newspaper reported, "The whole world now understands that Germany's blitzkrieg plan has been shattered by the Red Army's strong resistance. Although the enemy is still very strong and trying to achieve definite results before late autumn, it has mobilized all its reserves in the hope of breaking through the Red Army's defenses. In short, the stronger our resistance, the more adventurous the enemy's Eastern strategy will be. Leningrad is now in a precarious situation, but the enemy will not succeed."</p>
<p>Oslo, 23rd (TASS) – Military circles in Stockholm are highly doubtful about Germany's ability to conduct a successful winter war on the Eastern Front. They believe that the German authorities' current urgent preparations for winter warfare will not necessarily be effective. Germany has already ordered millions of pairs of skis in Norway, and a large number of Norwegian ski instructors have been sent to Germany to teach German soldiers to ski. Another report states that Germany plans to employ Finnish troops in Ukraine and the central sector of the Eastern Front. A military attaché from a neutral country said that, to his knowledge, German military and political leaders are well aware of the Russian climate and believe that construction of heated winter trenches must begin immediately.</p>

<p>Moscow, 23rd (Reuters) – The newspaper Pravda published a letter from a traveler from Berlin via Stockholm to Zurich in late July, stating that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had indeed been dismissed because the military believed that the setbacks on the Eastern Front should be the responsibility of the military. There are also rumors that Air Force Minister General Göring is under surveillance or detained in a concentration camp. At the same time, the Soviet news agency transmitted news from the Swedish capital that former Reich Bank President Schacht was dissatisfied with Hitler's war policy and was arrested. The Soviet news agency also transmitted rumors from Geneva that Ciano advocated Italy's neutrality and was asked to resign by both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Guerrilla Warfare on the Rise in German-Occupied Balkan Territories; British, Australian, and New Zealand Isolated Troops Active on Crete; Railway Sabotage Incidents Occur Frequently in France <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>London, 21st (United Press) – According to news from here yesterday, the extensive and organized guerrilla warfare in the German-occupied Balkan states is increasing daily and has gradually become a major problem for Hitler. It is understood that Crete and Greece are hotspots for guerrilla activity, and strikes and rebellions are occurring in Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, causing unease. Travelers returning from Romania say that 2,000 British, Australian, and New Zealand troops, led by a British officer, have formed an "isolated army" and are fighting on Crete. They have dyed their beards and hair and look no different from Cretan farmers, shepherds, and soldiers. For the past two months, they have been living in caves and descending from the mountains at night to attack German camps, ambush patrols, and loot supplies. It is understood that a new society of cave dwellers has developed in the mountains, with many soldiers of the Empire marrying Cretan women and holding weddings in the caves.</p>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Reuters) – The Vichy news agency reported that yesterday afternoon, a special train for miners derailed near the Valduni tunnel, and several carriages overturned, injuring thirty miners. This is the third accident on French railways this week. The Vichy authorities have acknowledged that there have been acts of sabotage on French railways and have appealed to railway workers to cooperate sincerely.</p>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Associated Press) – News from here yesterday stated that railway strikes occurred in the Paris area a few days ago, and similar actions took place at important transport hubs on the railway line south of Paris, causing significant material damage.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) – Two German soldiers were killed in Paris on Thursday. The German commander-in-chief of the occupied zone in France issued an order stating that if such actions occur again, a number of arrested French citizens will be executed in retaliation, depending on the severity of the action. This order takes effect today.</p>

<p>Great China</p>
<p>In the morning, Ma Jun ran to our cabin. I was washing my face with two basins of water. He shouted, "Planes are coming. Are you ready to escape to the fields?" "What are you going to do?" I asked. There was no place to hide in the village. A thatched hut was certainly of no use, but wading through the muddy fields was not an interesting prospect either. As we discussed the matter from all sides, we heard the drone of engines change from a distant hum to a nearby roar. We looked at the gray-black sky, waiting for this most tense moment, listening for the first bomb to drop. The planes passed. The village alarm sounded like a gong, made by striking an unexploded bomb cylinder. "They may be going to bomb Shaoguan," Ma Jun said unhappily. His wife and children were there.</p>
<p>They led us to a gun emplacement. Looking towards the Japanese side, there was no sound. This frontline could be called the quietest place in China. The officers seemed to have no need to awaken the sleeping mountains for our observation, but they wanted to show us the strength of the army. They were going to perform a military exercise.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek wanted to obtain Flying Fortresses from the United States. Someone said there was no place for the Fortresses to land, so Chiang immediately issued a directive: build an airfield within one hundred days. A Chinese engineer, a graduate of the University of Illinois, was in charge of this. The airfield was planned to be built in Chengdu. Each of the ten counties in Sichuan Province was to mobilize ten thousand people to work. (Sichuan has a population of fifty million, so recruiting one hundred thousand was very easy.) The one hundred thousand people walked along mountain paths, forming a black line, heading from all directions around Chengdu towards the vast brown plain. They carried the flags of their respective counties, marching day by day towards the town, dirty and ragged, like a revolutionary army on the move. Each county's workers were assigned a piece of land to work on. Once the project was completed, they could go home. The one hundred thousand people, armed with shovels, began to build an airfield of one thousand acres.</p>
<p>Such a great project had never been seen before, except for the pyramids and the Great Wall. Dust and sand flew in the airfield, like the terrible smoke of war. From afar, you could hear the sound of hammers striking the mountain rocks, and the workers singing loudly. Flags flew in the dust. Looking down from above, it was a vast plain reclaimed by labor, like a battlefield. Ant-like columns were pushing and pulling, completing one of the largest airfields in the world. They used five thousand wheelbarrows, one thousand trucks, two hundred thousand large baskets, and thirty-five thousand hammers. They mixed cement with their feet and carried stones on their backs from the riverbed, a mile away. When the airfield was completed, the runway was one and one-eighth miles wide. They built it in one hundred days, as instructed by the Chairman. Just as five million soldiers were trained, fed, and armed in this impregnable city, just as the Burma Road and the China-Soviet Highway were built, everything was done with determined will, using their hands to create, with the silent and resolute Chairman guiding and planning above.</p>
<p>China will surely win. Because the people could move factories, machinery, and school equipment to quiet mountain areas three times; transport military supplies to the front lines by civilian boats and porters; dig caves to prevent endless bombing from causing casualties; and build an airfield of one thousand acres in one hundred days without mechanical assistance. Of course, they can endure to the final victory. And time does not matter to China. Four years of war can be said to be a long time, but if you go back four thousand years in history, it is not that long. The Chinese are naturally resilient. They learn to endure from birth. Yes, time does not matter to China.</p>
<p>It took thirty-six hours to travel by gasoline boat upstream to the town where we parked our truck. The road was impassable due to heavy rain, and the truck wheels had to be printed in the mud. We could only continue to Shaoguan by boat. Ma Jun said optimistically that it would only take seven hours to arrive. We slowly sailed for half an hour, when suddenly the tow rope entangled the propeller of the steamboat. The helmsman reversed the engine to fix the propeller. Eighteen hours later, we saw the long bridge that the Japanese had been unable to destroy in a year. In the hotel, we could take a bath in a porcelain basin again. Shaoguan seemed to be the center of culture. (The End)</p>
<p>Ten thousand workers rush to build a large airfield barefoot in cement.</p>

<p>Chengdu: Over a hundred Japanese planes, in batches, raided Sichuan on the 23rd at noon. Over fifty of them flew near Chengdu, but due to bad weather and thick cloud cover, and after being driven off by the Chinese air force, they did not drop bombs and turned back. They then dropped bombs in batches on Leshan, Hechuan, Liangshan, and other places. Another fifty-odd planes intruded into the suburbs of Chongqing, causing havoc. It is reported that the damage caused by the Japanese planes in various places was minimal. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: One hundred and thirty-five Japanese planes raided Sichuan in batches on the 22nd. Eighty-one of them indiscriminately bombed civilian residential areas and cultural districts in the suburbs of Chongqing, destroying over a hundred civilian houses and dozens of school classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls. Fires broke out in several places but were quickly extinguished. The Adventist Church and the Business Daily were both destroyed. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, at least 108 Japanese planes in three batches raided Sichuan. The first batch of 27 planes heavily bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing. The second batch of 54 planes and the third batch of 27 planes flew west towards Chengdu after passing over Chongqing. It is now known that a total of 135 Japanese planes bombed Sichuan Province yesterday, with 81 planes bombing the western suburbs of Chongqing. The National Central University and the Chinese Red Cross Hospital were heavily damaged, while others bombed near Chengdu. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, about 100 Japanese planes in several groups attacked Sichuan. One group bombed the cultural area outside Chongqing at 11:30 AM. Chongqing issued an alert that lasted five hours, ending at 3:30 PM. Jiangbei Town on the north bank of the Jialing River was also bombed, and a bomb landed 30 yards from the Jialing Hotel, blowing out several doors and windows. Two groups of Japanese bombers bombed the outskirts of Chongqing, five to seven miles upstream on the Jialing River, causing three fires. The first batch of Japanese planes numbered 26, and the second batch numbered 24. Yesterday, during the attack on Chongqing, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was destroyed, killing six Chinese people in the air-raid shelter. The headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross caught fire, and the Red Cross Hospital was destroyed. The National Central University, Chongqing University, and Nankai Middle School were also attacked yesterday, causing fires and minor damage to several classrooms. At the same time, the Chongqing Water Company announced today that the water plant and several main water pipes were damaged during yesterday's attack but have been quickly repaired.

The ship is currently being detained here. Another Japanese freighter arrived earlier this month, carrying 10,000 tons of oil, but 6,000 tons of it could not be loaded because the cargo owner failed to obtain a shipping permit.

<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Associated Press): The Japanese government yesterday relaxed the previous freeze order, announcing that, starting today, designated foreigners will be allowed to withdraw 1,000 yen per month from banks for living expenses (the current limit is 500 yen). However, this rule only applies to deposits in banks or post offices of designated nationalities, mostly Japanese banks. This move will make life easier for ordinary foreigners. However, in terms of US dollars, this is only half of the amount of deposits that Japanese people are allowed to withdraw in the United States. The rule does not include Citibank, HSBC, or the Dutch East Indies Bank.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Reuters): The Japan News Weekly, the only periodical publication in Japan run by Americans, has been granted special permission by the Ministry of Finance to continue withdrawing funds to maintain publication for a period of six months. This is the only foreign business in Japan that is exempt from the freeze.</p>

<p>In order to promote education, the Shanghai Municipal Council allocates funds each year as subsidies to private schools. Any Chinese private school in the Public Concession whose management, facilities, and academic performance are deemed satisfactory by the Council and in urgent need of financial assistance may apply for a subsidy. Any school applying for a subsidy must comply with the provisions of its regulations. Only those schools deemed satisfactory by the Council will receive subsidies.

<p>School Affairs: (1) Every school receiving a subsidy must have a principal or director to preside over the school's daily affairs and supervise the work of the faculty. (2) Every school receiving a subsidy must have qualified teachers. The Council will determine whether the number of teachers is sufficient and whether their abilities are adequate based on the school's layout, student attendance, school organization, curriculum content, and the qualifications of the teachers and the courses they teach.</p>
<p>Curriculum Outline: (1) The curriculum of any school receiving a subsidy must meet the following: (1) the teaching must be based on the curriculum and its outline determined by the nature and organization of the school, and must comply with the educational policies and regulations of the Ministry of Education of the National Government of the Republic of China; (2) school teaching should encourage patriotism and good citizenship education, and should not implement teaching that could harm international relations or incite racial hatred; (3) the weekly timetable for each grade level and the weekly class schedule for each class must be posted and announced. (2) Only kindergarten classes that have the nature and adequate facilities of a kindergarten may apply for recognition.</p>
<p>Subsidy Allocation: (1) The amount of the subsidy will be determined by the school's academic performance, financial needs, and student attendance. (2) Only schools that have been operating for more than one year will be eligible for a subsidy. The Council will determine the allocation and use of the subsidy each year. (3) The Council's subsidy will be paid in four installments each year, and may be changed or suspended at any time if there is sufficient reason. In addition to the above regulations, there are ten other forms that must be completed and submitted one by one.

<p>The famous calligrapher Tan Zejun, also known as Pingzhai, comes from a family of high officials with a long-standing scholarly tradition. He is the younger brother of the late Premier Tan Zu'an. His calligraphy comes from the lineage of Qian Nanyuan, and is grand, mellow, profound, and meticulously powerful, comparable to that of Mr. Qian. It has long been well-known and admired. There are few calligraphers of his time who can match him. In the past, Zu'an often told people that his writing was not as good as that of his younger brother. One can imagine how highly regarded he is. Recently, various painters and calligraphers have repeatedly increased their fees, but Mr. Tan has not. He still charges the same fees as he did several years ago, because he is upright and unconventional. He does not want to make a living from his calligraphy, but only uses it to express his feelings and to form a bond of artistic friendship with those who appreciate it.</p>

<p>The third act of the charity basketball and volleyball tournament organized by the Disaster Relief Education Center was still held at the Guoqiang Middle School yesterday afternoon. Because the men's basketball match between the Blue and White teams and the All Black team was postponed, the audience decreased slightly, and ticket sales were also slightly affected. In the women's volleyball match, Friend Star played against Shanghai Star again. Friend Star took advantage of its winning streak, while Shanghai Star was determined to take revenge. The two sides performed brilliantly, and the battle was full of thrills. Shanghai Star took the lead with eight to four, and then switched sides at eleven to ten. Friend Star, relying on Zhu Shifang's fierce serves, took the lead with seventeen to twelve. Shanghai Star resisted and scored six consecutive points, thus regaining the lead. However, Friend Star immediately regained the first set with twenty-one to eighteen. In the second set, Shanghai Star's situation improved, and they took the lead. Friend Star was always behind. At twenty-one to eleven, Shanghai Star won easily. In the third set, the competition became more intense. Friend Star gained the right to switch sides with eleven to ten, and took the lead several times. Seeing that the opportunity would not come again, all the players of Shanghai Star gave their all. Chen Meizhen was particularly active, contributing the most, and took an absolute advantage with twenty to seventeen. Friend Star responded calmly, forcing a tie at twenty each, and then at twenty-one each. Shanghai Star scored two more points and finally avenged the previous defeat with twenty-three to twenty-one. Now the two sides have each won one match, and a third match is needed to determine who is the champion of the Shanghai Women's Volleyball League. After that, the men's basketball match was between Qianghua and Shanghai Star. In the first half, Shanghai Star was at a disadvantage with nine to sixteen. In the end, Qianghua defeated Shanghai Star with forty-one to thirty-one. In the auction of the match ball, the basketball was purchased by little Miss Cao Guangya for 600 yuan, and the volleyball was purchased by philanthropist Mr. Qian Junsui for 1,000 yuan. The total revenue of yesterday's game was 2,129 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Importance of the Survey on the Livelihood of Teachers and Staff in Primary and Secondary Schools <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— LT</p>
<p>The responsibility of teachers in primary and secondary schools is the most important, their status is the noblest, their demeanor is the most refined, and their knowledge is the most abundant. Only in this way can they serve as role models for students. The amount of time they work is also the greatest, but their remuneration is very low. The poor lives of teachers and staff are probably the worst among the salaried classes today. China should have regarded teaching as a profession for poor scholars, but it has not been able to improve this situation even today. This is regrettable. However, everyone knows about the poverty of teachers in primary and secondary schools, but the extent of their poor lives has only now had a chance to be expressed. This so-called expression is not to make each individual's life public to the world, because expressing individual lives still cannot serve as a standard for the life enjoyed by a certain profession. Only by compiling the daily living expenses of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools, using statistical methods to classify, organize, and compile the results, and expressing them in numbers, can such an expression not only have no trace of individuals, but also be detailed and clear, so that it can serve as a standard for general life. This is the salaried class cost of living index that the Industrial and Social Department of the Public Works Bureau wants to compile, and is currently collecting family living expenses account books. Since it is called the salaried class cost of living index, it must be based on the total classification of the daily living expenses of each salaried class as the basis. Therefore, the more people in each profession who participate in keeping accounts, the greater the effectiveness of the compiled index, the wider the scope of application, and the stronger the expression of truth. Teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools not only have an important position in society, but also account for the majority of the salaried class. The future improvement of their lives cannot be without a scientific calculation as a basis. If teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools now voluntarily participate in this salaried class cost of living account keeping, then the salaried class cost of living index compiled by the Industrial and Social Department in the future will not have representatives of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools. It can only represent the salaried class of other general industrial and commercial circles. Once it is to be applied to teachers in primary and secondary schools, it will inevitably be considered inappropriate and inconvenient. Moreover, the matter of keeping accounts is easy to do, especially for teacher families, where there are often men and women who have received considerable education, so it is even easier to do. It only takes a few minutes each day to complete, and it can be completed in three months. It is a work that benefits oneself and the public, and is convenient for both public and private affairs. If you think that the lives of teachers and staff are too poor, and you do not want to show the truth of your family's trivial daily expenses, then you will inevitably be misled by vain thoughts. It is important to know that poverty is not a burden. Looking at the great sages and virtuous people, writers and scholars in history, many of them lived in empty huts with meager meals, and were unable to continue cooking. Only then could they leave behind their noble integrity, admired by the world, and followed by scholars, and their culture was greatly renewed. Moreover, precisely because the lives of the salaried class are extremely difficult, the compilation of a cost of living index is even more necessary in order to have a standard to follow. If life is affluent, then the existence or absence of a cost of living index is insignificant. Therefore, eating only vegetables and radishes every day is nothing to be ashamed of, and pawning and borrowing are nothing to be ashamed of. Only by frankly and honestly providing the truth about living expenses for statistical research can one not lose sight of the most valuable move. The reporter is deeply aware of the importance of this move, so he dares to inform teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools. (For this cost of living account keeping, you can automatically prepare a letter or go in person to the Statistics Section of the Industrial and Social Department of the Public Works Bureau on Jiangxi Road to obtain the regulations for review and registration, with a deadline of September 5, and account keeping will begin in October, with a limit of three months.)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Grain: The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Wholesale Price Has Fallen, but Retail Prices Still Remain at the Original Level <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of imported rice had once turned stable, yesterday it suddenly dropped because the Shanghai Municipal Council announced a reduction of four yuan per dan for its rice, releasing 1,000 tons at a wholesale price of 139.88 yuan per picul, handled by the Racine, Ackermann &amp; Co. (立基洋行). Public sentiment has become uncertain. It is also rumored that retail prices will soon be reduced. Furthermore, due to price reductions abroad, Chinese and foreign merchants are actively selling at 145-146 yuan. The spot price at the China &amp; Japan Trading Co. (英華司) is only 144 yuan, and Second Grade Siamese rice is only 137 yuan, but there are few buyers. The price of domestic rice is further affected by the remaining 1,188,375 bags of stored rice. Speculators and small dealers are eager to sell their holdings, leading to increased sales volume and a more severe price decline. Various prices are falling rapidly, and although the closing prices for all types of rice were significantly lower by three to four yuan compared to the previous day, the total trading volume was still low, only about one-third of the previous day's volume. The closing prices were: First Grade Saigon old rice at 139 yuan, high-quality rice at 133.5 yuan, 132 yuan, general quality at 130 yuan, mid-grade at 128 yuan; Second Grade at 122-123 yuan, especially old rice at 124-125 yuan; Second Grade Siamese rice ranged from a high of 119 yuan to 115 yuan; Min Dang (敏黨) high-quality rice at 133 yuan, mid-grade at 124 yuan, then 122 yuan; Qie Fo (茄佛) rice at 128 yuan, high-quality at 130 yuan. Initial small-scale bank warehouse prices were at 122 yuan, later only 119.5 yuan, while external warehouses ranged from 121 yuan to 118.5 yuan. Broken rice ranged from a high of 93 yuan to 90 yuan, then 88.5 yuan. Tokyo Red Rice was at 105 yuan. Total trading volume for spot rice was 7,000 bags, and even the China &amp; Japan Trading Co. traded less than 400 tons.</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Domestic Rice: After prices suddenly dropped due to an accumulation of supply, yesterday, with incoming shipments declining and local retailers actively purchasing due to the low prices, sellers were firm in their intention to sell. Therefore, despite the sharp decline in imported rice prices, the prices of Thick and Thin polished rice were maintained without significant fluctuations. Nantong early rice was priced at 152-150 yuan. Wuxi original-package special polished rice was priced at 154 yuan, general quality at 149 yuan, old rice at 144 yuan. Pudong new polished rice, due to limited supply, remained stable, priced at 158 yuan and 156.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: After continuous brisk sales, market supply has decreased. Yesterday, supply and demand were balanced, and there were no significant changes in the market. Prices remained unchanged. Hong Kong special glutinous rice was priced at 131-130 yuan, general quality at 128-129 yuan, then 125 yuan. Glutinous green beans ranged from a high of 116.5 yuan to 113 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice, due to intermittent supply, was particularly in demand, with ordinary quality selling for as high as 137-138 yuan.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot market for imported flour showed signs of weakness. Retail sales in the city are still experiencing a shortage of flour from factories, with daily demand remaining strong. Resales are also absorbing supply. However, with the sharp drop in rice prices and the weakness in the gold market, public sentiment remains low, and the market has weakened amidst the calmness. Jinlong (金龍) flour was priced at 32.8-33 yuan, Pao (砲) flour at 33.9-34 yuan, Bian (變) flour at 33.7 yuan, and Banana flour at 33.8 yuan, all down by two to three jiao. Total trading volume was approximately 20,000 bags, and the market remains in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market showed steady firmness due to extremely limited incoming shipments in recent days. Sellers are raising prices due to shortages, while factory gate prices have been slightly relaxed. Market transactions remain stagnant as usual.</p>

<p>Resulting in Only a Small Recovery of Three to Four Yuan: The edible oil market, after news of incoming shipments from Tianjin, saw a shift in public sentiment yesterday morning. Speculators and small dealers stopped hoarding and began selling, but large investors continued to buy on dips, causing a slight recovery after the initial decline. The overall result was a decrease of three to four yuan. Over 1,000 dan of Qing (清) oil from the Tayeh Factory (大有廠) were sold, priced at 203-200 yuan. August deliveries were priced at 200-198 yuan, and early September deliveries at 206-205 yuan. 4,000 dan of rapeseed oil from the Nichi-Wa Factory (日華廠) for early September delivery were priced at 201-204.5 yuan, and late September deliveries at 207-203.5 yuan. 150 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Taishan Factory (泰山廠) for early September delivery were priced at 199-200 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, 63 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin yesterday, and 2,448 bags of raw peanuts arrived from Yantai. Today, 800 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Xiamen and 360 bags to Hong Kong. In addition, 1,600 pieces of bean cake will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Yarn and Cotton: Miscellaneous Brand Yarn Sales Are Active, and Sentiment in the Yarn Market Is High <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Factory prices jump another 0.19 yuan... Futures are boosted even more strongly</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending upwards after hovering around the same price, but the rise is not very strong. This is because the trading volume of the Double Horse (雙馬) factory is not as high as it once was. However, miscellaneous brands have been quite active recently. Firstly, sales are actually not bad. Secondly, some people cannot directly access the market and are turning to miscellaneous brands. As a result, the long-stagnant 20-count Yueqin (月琴) and Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) Japanese yarn are gradually recovering. Demand for 32-count single yarn from Hong Kong merchants remains strong, and prices continue to rise. Today, 2,335 bales of yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong. There is widespread discussion in the market that the prices of 20-count and miscellaneous brand yarn are still cheap, and those who are absorbing and hoarding them are very active. Currently, the yarn market is still stabilizing, and the price of 42-count thread has broken through the 4,000 yuan mark, reaching 4,025 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened higher in the morning because of the strong gains in the afternoon of the previous day. Public sentiment was high, and shorts were covering extensively. The opening price jumped 0.19 yuan to 1,715 yuan. It rose briefly to 1,720 yuan, but some longs sold, and at the same time, the spot exchange jumped 0.30 yuan, but far-month contracts fell 0.10 yuan, and the mood momentarily weakened, and the market eased, falling to 1,707-1,708 yuan. Subsequently, with widespread sales and a uniform rise in miscellaneous brand yarns, buying sentiment recovered. Furthermore, cotton merchants were very keen to buy due to the high price of raw cotton. The price gradually rose again to close at 1,725 yuan, up 0.29 yuan from the previous day. According to the statistics of transactions by various groups, the figures are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 47 (This number might be incomplete in the original document) Mainland: 5 Brokers: 4,850 Total: 5,125</p>
<p>The Double Horse futures market continued to rise sharply during the morning session. Although there were no special relaxations in the environment, actual yarn sales seemed to be more active, and with raw cotton prices firming, the cost of spot yarn gradually became more rigid. In addition, speculators shifted their targets and focused on boosting prices, leading to strong buying interest and forcing shorts to cover. As a result, prices soared and showed no signs of slowing down. The market opened in the morning with continuous gains in factory prices, further boosting the confidence of longs. Therefore, additional positions and the entry of new longs created demand exceeding supply. The September contract opened at 1,607 yuan, the October contract at 1,636 yuan, and the November contract at 1,650 yuan, each up 0.07-0.08 yuan. In the second session, some retail longs took profits, causing a temporary decline, with the near-term reaching 1,600 yuan, the October contract at 1,622 yuan, and the November contract at 1,646 yuan. However, with longs continuously absorbing on dips, sellers could not resist and prices were pulled up again, reaching new highs of 1,615 yuan for the September contract, 1,640 yuan for the October contract, and 1,668 yuan for the November contract. Compared to the mediocrity of other markets, the firmness of the yarn market is likely to continue. However, new longs at high peaks should pay attention to the influence of foreign scholars and selling at high prices. The September contract closed at 1,610 yuan, up 0.095 yuan, the October contract at 1,638 yuan, up 0.10 yuan, and the November contract at 1,666 yuan, up 0.12 yuan. Trading volume for the morning session was 17,260 bales, down 5,860 bales from the previous day. The market is closed on Saturday afternoons. As of the 22nd, the total number of outstanding contracts for the next three months was 21,200 bales, including 7,650 bales for the September contract, 10,130 bales for the October contract, and 3,420 bales for the November contract. A record of the opening, closing, high, and low prices for the morning session is listed below (net prices):</p>
<h3 id="e62">20-count Raw Cotton Recovers, Coarse Cotton Shows Improvement <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation: Coarse cotton remains popular, and prices have risen by another 0.06-0.07 yuan. Public sentiment is very excited, and all are buying 20-count raw cotton and holding on to their holdings. The market shows an upward trend.</p>
<p>Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai: The market is clean and firm. Because all parties have purchased large quantities in recent days, interest has slightly waned. At the same time, Shanghai's current inventory is quite sufficient, and factory demand is not urgent. Therefore, purchasing has not been as active as in previous days. Yesterday, only three or four firms continued to order approximately 700-800 bales of Brazilian cotton, and factories were less enthusiastic about making further purchases.</p>
<p>The New York Cotton Market: Steady and active. The market initially rose due to cotton production, harvesting conditions, and unfavorable weather reports, and shorts covered their positions. At the same time, spot traders and brokers were buying heavily. Subsequently, the market declined slightly due to profit-taking. As a result, closing prices were up 6-11 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the US cotton statistics from August 1st to August 22nd of this year are recorded below (per 500-pound bale):</p>
<p>Total listed: 298,000 bales</p>
<p>Total factory consumption: 356,000 bales</p>
<p>Total exports: 36,000 bales</p>
<p>Inventory in various port cities: 5,168,000 bales</p>
<p>The Indian Cotton Market: Initially, the market eased due to selling by brokers, but subsequently rebounded due to short covering and buying by speculators. As a result, yesterday's closing prices, except for the April-May White Loch contract which fell by 0.25 rupees, rose by approximately 3-4 rupees. It is predicted that today's market opening will rise by 1.25 rupees.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was quiet, with downward pressure, as bulls from the Chaozhou (潮州) and Hong Kong groups sold off, causing selling pressure to surge. The spot price fell from 6,890 yuan to 6,825 yuan, eventually falling 0.12 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 50,000-60,000 taels, mostly for closing positions. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. For swap (August to September), the small HSBC counter's US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged. As the deadline for settling futures at that price approached at the end of the month, buyers were eager to sell, and the premium rose, from 0.21-0.22 yuan to Shun Yuan (順源) offering 120 taels to Beijing Qing Tai Yong (北京市慶泰永) at a premium of 0.27 yuan. The difference with the US dollar settlement price was minimal. Sellers bought in, so the premium went back down. The premium in the afternoon was around 0.24 yuan. Spot gold initially rose and then fell. Cheng Da (誠達) sold 10 taels to Tai Kang Run (泰康潤) at an unprecedented high price of 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, selling pressure increased sharply, and the price immediately fell. Fengxiang (鳳祥) and H记 (和記) sold 20 taels, and Tai Kang Run (泰康潤) and Da Feng (大豐) each sold 10 taels, all bought by Cheng Ji (成記). Tian Yuan (天元) sold 30 taels to Shihe (時和) and Xin Tian Bao (新天寶) sold 10 taels, all at a price of 9,970 yuan. Tian Yuan (天元) then repurchased 30 taels from Shun Yuan (順源) and 10 taels from Xiang He (祥和), and Shun Yuan (順源) sold 10 taels to Tai Kang Run (泰康潤), all at a price of 9,960 yuan. Xiang He (祥和) sold 20 taels to Cheng Da (誠達) at a price of 9,930 yuan. Shihe (時和) bought 10 taels from Heng Ji (恒記) at 9,950 yuan. At noon, there were buyers at the above prices, down a small 0.10 yuan from the previous day. Gold ornaments remained at 1,020 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Down 0.40+ Yuan</p>
<p>From the opening of the market at 9:15 AM, each bar (10 taels) was priced at 6,870 yuan, 0.07 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous night. Supply and demand were uneven, and the price rose to 6,880 yuan, then retreated to 6,860 yuan. Da Feng (大豐) and Yi Da (益大) bought in succession, and the black market US dollar softened to 4.65 (This might be incomplete in the original document), causing the price to surge 0.30 yuan to 6,890 yuan. Seeing this high, traders sold, and Xiang Xing Yong (祥興永), Heng Ji (恒記), Da Cheng Yong (大成永), Li Tai (立泰), and Xin Feng Yong (新豐永) sold off at around 6,860 yuan, hovering around for a long time. Until 10:45 AM, selling pressure increased and fell more than 0.30 yuan to 6,825 yuan. Near noon, Cheng Ji (成記), Yi Yuan (義元), and Gong Da (公大) bought in, pulling the price up 0.20 yuan to 6,845 yuan. Xin Feng Yong (新豐永) and others continued to sell off. The noon closing price was 6,835 yuan, 0.42 yuan lower than the previous night's closing price. It rose slightly to 6,842-6,843 yuan after closing. There was no off-exchange trading in the afternoon. The retail price of branded gold at spot gold shops still needs to be 10,000 yuan, and the buying price is 200 yuan lower than the selling price. There is still no market for spot margin gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Purchase Price Reduced by 0.50 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price per tael of jewelry sold by jewelry stores, both Datonghang (大同行) and Xintonghang (新同行), still hangs at 1,020 yuan without change, but the purchase price must be reduced by 0.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Foreign Exchange: It Is Still Difficult to Find the Official Exchange Rate <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: The exchange rates listed by HSBC did not change. The US dollar exchange rate at small counters remained at 5.3125 yuan, and the British pound exchange rate at 3 shillings and 1.5625 pence. It is still difficult to find the official exchange rate for the black market British pound and US dollar. The repeated meetings of foreign banks are likely to yield obvious results only next Monday. Chinese merchants and speculators who were long are taking profits in small amounts. The price has only tightened slightly for the British pound, and the US dollar is still flat. Transactions are scarce. There is no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sell Off US Dollars</p>
<p>From the morning, the foreign [Indian] silver futures exchange rate contracted, and the US-Indian silver markets were flat. The exchange rate of various countries against Shanghai rose by a small 0.02 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. The exchange rates listed by the Central Bank were still flat. The domestic exchange rate for the British pound was 2 shillings and 7.8125 pence, tight by 0.03125. The US dollar remained at 4.6875 yuan. Chinese merchants and speculators were still selling small amounts. The exchange rates listed by HSBC did not change. After the silver balancing tax remained at 24.25%, importers were unable to obtain a US dollar exchange rate of 4.6875 yuan for August, which softened to 4.625 yuan. However, it was also difficult for Chinese merchants to sell at 4.6875 yuan. They needed 4.75 yuan. Foreign banks rarely bought in. Until the noon closing price, the exchange rates were still 2 shillings and 7.8125 pence for the British pound and 4.6875 yuan for the US dollar, tighter by 0.03125 for the British pound and flat for the US dollar compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Securities: Domestic Debt Rises Due to Short Covering <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The off-exchange market for domestic debt suddenly saw an upward trend yesterday. The trend was quite strong. Longs struggled to raise prices, gradually breaking through 0.08 yuan. Shorts covered their positions, leading to a high price of 8.55 yuan. It is rare to see such a high price after the ex-dividend date in these troubled times. Whether there is a continued ability to rise depends on whether the environment can provide assistance, otherwise relying solely on human efforts may be a flash in the pan. Yesterday was Saturday, and only the morning session was held. Tongshun (同順), Dazhong (大中), Shengsheng (生生), Dade (大德), and Fu (孚) bought, and Xiekang (協康) also absorbed. Liany (聯益), Xie Da (協大), Hengkang (恒康), Jiufeng (久豐), Hong Da (鴻大), and Tongkang (同康) mostly sold. The battle line between buyers and sellers can only be described as evenly matched. As a result, there was a sudden increase of 0.05 to 0.085 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 1,200,000 to 1,300,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market continued to be firm, and sellers uniformly raised prices, because dyeing factories and hoarders in the city are still actively buying.

<p>Domestic Lanxi (蘭溪) fragrant mushrooms have been singing high prices recently due to scarce arrivals. Yesterday, the market opened at 2,500 yuan. Other Dong (東) goods were even more expensive, opening at 2,765-2,785 yuan. Winter mushrooms were at 3,120 yuan, and the next grade was at 2,865-2,766 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 157 bags of dates, 12 bags of almonds, and 30 bags of peach kernels arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Due to recent scarcity in arrivals, the market price of black fungus has been gradually increasing. Yesterday, 50 bags of clear water goods were offered, and because the color and shape of the slices were still good, the opening price broke through the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching 1,030 yuan. Xietai (協泰), Shenxing (慎興), and Baochang (寶昌) divided the goods equally. Based on the market price of fragrant fungus, it would not be surprising if it rose by several hundred more.</p>

<p>The market for 200-pound Huisi (會司) iron from the US: Due to the weak inventory and scarcity of circulating goods in Shanghai, the mental state of colleagues holding small amounts of this product are extraordinarily high, and because of collection from can making factories, printing factories, toy factories, and biscuit companies, the current cargo feels even more tight. The metal holders' confidence continued to grow. Moreover, they are not willing to sell off their stock casually. Therefore, the opening price is unusually firm and high. Yesterday, for example, 200-pound old steel mill stock sold for 700 yuan per box, and new steel mill stock sold for 690 yuan per box, all of which were several yuan higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>Although the domestic market for charcoal is very sluggish this season, it is being forced up because of a shortage of supply and because a certain foreign firm has not yet dispatched goods due to unresolved internal disputes among its managers. Yesterday, Haimen (海門) flat-cap charcoal was trading at 19 yuan per dan, and small basket Huangyan (黃岩) charcoal was at 15.5 yuan. There was a slight difference of one to two yuan in the open and shadow market, which were horizontally lifted and surreptitiously added by general brokers, creating this chaotic situation.</p>

<h3 id="e71">British Member of the Exchange Equalization Committee Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Specific Foreign Exchange Supply Plan <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>#### Hall-Patch Arrived from Hong Kong Last Night; Cooperation with Taylor to Complete Mission; Merchant's Telegram Request for Partial Foreign Exchange Supply Approved</p>
<p>E.L. Hall-Patch, the British member of China's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee who was dispatched to Shanghai for supervision after the first meeting of the committee in Chongqing on the 16th of this month, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong at 8 PM last night. Representatives from the Chinese national banks jointly went to the Roosevelt Wharf to welcome him and accompanied Mr. Hall-Patch by car to stay at the Metropole Hotel. Mr. Hall-Patch is a financial advisor to the British Far East. He was hired to succeed Mr. Rogers, the former advisor to the Central Bank, who was transferred to the Hong Kong government as an economic advisor.</p>
<p>Specific Plan to be Formulated Soon</p>
<p>The speed of his arrival in Shanghai is due to the decision of the Stabilization Fund Committee on the one hand, and the repeated urging of Dr. Taylor, the American assistant in Shanghai, on the other. His most urgent mission in Shanghai is clearly to cooperate with Taylor and work with the Shanghai British and American banks and the authorities of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank of China to formulate the most specific plan for supplying foreign exchange, so that the Stabilization Fund Committee and the designated Chinese and foreign banks can cooperate and act in unison, supplying the necessary foreign exchange at the prices of 5.34375 yuan for the US dollar and 3 shillings and 1.1875 pence for the British pound, to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating the black market, and to fulfill the mission of using the Stabilization Fund. It has not yet been decided how long Mr. Hall-Patch will stay in Shanghai. However, since his mission here is of utmost importance, he will stay in Shanghai with Dr. Taylor for a longer period of time to observe the effectiveness of the implementation of the foreign exchange market management and provide instructions as needed.</p>
<p>Basic Principles for Approving Foreign Exchange Supply Approved</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the New Sheng News Agency from related banks yesterday, the first thing Mr. Hall-Patch will do after arriving in Shanghai is to convene key personnel from HSBC, Citibank, Mercantile Bank, Shenyang Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to conduct further research and consideration based on the basic principles of foreign exchange settlement agreed upon by Taylor and the banking community. According to this basic principle, foreign exchange will only be supplied for the import of essential goods. To prevent the unlimited supply from affecting Soviet gold, essential goods will be divided into three categories: important, secondary, and tertiary. All military projects will be fully supplied, while secondary and tertiary categories will be partially supplied. As for goods that are prohibited from import and those that are nearly luxury goods but are not included in the prohibited import list, all of them have the right to be completely rejected. This principle will not be changed. The reason why it is still necessary to continue discussions after Mr. Hall-Patch arrives in Shanghai is to seek his opinions and obtain more consistent approval.</p>
<p>Three Key Points of Implementation Details for Foreign Exchange Settlement</p>
<p>The implementation details of the foreign exchange settlement method will be formulated by the Joint Office of the four Shanghai banks based on the aforementioned basic principles. The key points are as follows: (1) Full implementation of the list of items prohibited from import announced by the customs in July 1939; (2) Essential goods approved for import by the Executive Yuan meeting in September 1939 should be divided into three categories according to importance; (3) Regulations on application procedures and guarantees for applying for foreign exchange, including application forms, application guarantees, review standards, and processing time periods. After the four banks formulate these implementation methods, they will be uniformly implemented by all designated banks. At the same time, in terms of foreign exchange settlement for exporters, the authorities have stipulated that when export goods are transported from other ports to Shanghai for transshipment, foreign exchange must be settled in advance at that port. As for the foreign exchange settlement of goods exported from this city, efforts will be made to concentrate the processing through the Bank of China and Bank of Communications. If the foreign exchange settlement method can be adjusted satisfactorily, the "selling" in the black market can be stopped.</p>
<p>Merchants' Request for Partial Approval Approved</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund telegraphed that a small portion of the telegraphic requests from merchants to supply foreign exchange to this bank has been approved. After this news came out, the black market exchange rate in this port gradually showed a firm trend. The time period from application to approval has been greatly shortened compared to before, so the tense situation of merchants competing for foreign exchange is expected to gradually ease. In addition, another reason for the recent tense situation in obtaining foreign exchange is that a large shipment of cotton from Brazil and the United States will be shipped to Shanghai in the near future. The difference between the current cotton price and the cotton yarn price has made cotton imports a very profitable transaction.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Shanghai Municipal Council Reduces Price of Foreign Rice by Four Yuan Per Shi; Price Tomorrow Will Be 120 Yuan Per Shi; Public Granary Rice Was Sold Yesterday and Eagerly Bought by the Public; Other Commodity Prices Should Also Follow Suit <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement directly purchased rice and distributed it at a fair price through rice shops throughout the city, the benefits to the food supply for the Shanghai citizens have been significant. On the 15th of this month, the Council suddenly issued a notice stating that due to the sharp increase in costs, they were forced to raise the fair price of foreign rice from 116 yuan per shi to 124 yuan (net weight 160 jin per shi), and this was implemented on the 16th of this month. Subsequently, due to public outcry and a unanimous appeal to the authorities to consider the livelihood of the common people and maintain the original fair rice price to alleviate their difficulties, it is now learned that the Council has decided to reduce the selling price of fair rice from tomorrow in order to thoroughly implement its original intention of managing rice and maintaining social order. The notice is recorded as follows: "From the 25th of this month, the maximum retail price of foreign rice from this Bureau will be changed to 120 yuan in national currency per shi (net weight 160 jin)."</p>
<p>Granary Investigation</p>
<p>The 125th rice inventory investigation by the Bean and Rice Trade Association was completed yesterday. The total amount of rice stored in more than 80 Chinese and foreign granaries this period (from last Saturday to this Saturday) reached 1,150,377 bags, slightly less than the previous period. The Bean and Rice Association has already reported the results of the investigation to the authorities of the two settlements and seven rice trade groups for their reference. The above-mentioned amount of rice stored is limited to various Chinese and foreign granaries. As for the total amount of rice stored in the city, it is sufficient for more than nine months of consumption.</p>
<p>Granary Rice Sales</p>
<p>The Public Grain Depot Management Committee has repeatedly commissioned various import companies to purchase large quantities of public granary rice from Thailand, Yangon, and other places, which have been successively transported to Shanghai. In addition to 27,150 bags of small-sized rice being sold to the Public Works Department and distributed at a fair price by various rice shops, which has greatly benefited the food supply for the citizens of this city, the committee has specially allocated 3,734 bags of No. 2 Siam rice, which has already been transported to Shanghai, to 46 rice shops in the two settlements in order to further regulate the food supply for the people. It was sold at a uniform price of 116 yuan per shi (net weight 160 jin) starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. The amount of purchase and sale shall not exceed one shi, and each rice shop selling granary rice must establish separate accounts and record them daily for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Jewish Refugees Residing in Kobe Are Expelled and Come to Shanghai; 296 People Arrive by Asama Maru <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that in the next few weeks, no fewer than 900 European Jewish refugees will arrive in Shanghai from Japan and reside there temporarily until they obtain visas to go to the United States, Palestine, and Burma. The first batch of 296 men, women, and children, mostly Polish Jews, had been staying in Japan for about a year. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 22nd) aboard the Japanese ship Asama Maru and are temporarily staying in Hongkou. It is heard that the British Authorities have specially permitted some religious Jews to go to Palestine in groups and have provided some Jews with the convenience of going to Burma soon. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. It is heard that about 2,000 Jews who arrived in Japan a year ago were originally scheduled to transit through Japan and only stay for 14 days, but they were unable to obtain permission to go to their destinations, so they were unable to depart. The Japanese government specially permitted them to reside in Kobe, but after repeated extensions, it has now been a year. Recently, it announced that these Jews must leave the country before the middle of next month, forcing them to move to Shanghai to wait for the British and American authorities to allow them to go to the United States and other destinations.</p>

<p>Japanese troops in Nanshi recently held combat exercises and built fortifications near Lujiabang. The situation was quite tense for a time. Traffic on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi was cut off from 1:00 PM the day before yesterday and only resumed in the evening. Residents in the vicinity were all greatly frightened.</p>

<p>Texaco, one of the three major American gasoline companies in this city, has decided to move its head office to Singapore at the beginning of next month. However, it will not give up its business in this city. The ten gas stations it has set up in the two settlements will continue to exist and supply gasoline. The above news has also been confirmed by Mr. Massigli, the general manager of the company. It is said that it was ordered by the New York head office that due to the sluggish business in Shanghai, it was decided to move the head office to Singapore. An office will still be established in Shanghai to continue business as usual, so that the gasoline supply in this city will continue to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Another report says that more than 100 Chinese and Western employees of the company were laid off the day before yesterday, and each was given six months' severance pay. Mr. Massigli will remain in his old position and lead a group of American employees to Singapore in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>It is reported that a group of U.S. consulate officials and naval officers in Japan will arrive in Shanghai from Kobe on the 28th of this month aboard the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Tatsuta Maru. The group of U.S. officials consists of 26 people, including 9 naval officers, 2 Marines, 4 Army interpreters, 2 consulate staff, and 9 consulate staff who recently withdrew from the Soviet Union. In addition, there are Ms. Clarying and Mr. Lewis, employees of the American President Lines, and Mr. Di Wen, an employee of the American Import Company. Because of the disruption of shipping between Japan and the United States, and because the ships of the American President Lines have stopped calling at Japanese ports, these American expatriates plan to transfer to the U.S. transport ship Hunterson in Shanghai to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Consulate Officials Stationed in Soviet Union to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is also reported that eight British and American consulate staff stationed in the Soviet Union arrived in Japan on the 21st from Moscow via Siberia. Mrs. Mezidov, a reporter for the United News Agency stationed in Moscow, and Mr. and Mrs. Harperd, former Associated Press reporters stationed in Moscow, and their two children will also arrive in Shanghai soon and transfer to a mail ship to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese Nationals in Philippines Eager to Withdraw</p>
<p>Araki, a counselor at the Japanese Consulate General in Manila, withdrew to Shanghai yesterday. According to a reporter from the Japanese Alliance News Agency, most of the Japanese nationals who withdrew had been living in the Philippines for 20 or 30 years. They were originally scheduled to leave Manila aboard the Japanese ships Kamakura Maru and Ganges Maru, but these Japanese ships no longer sail to the Philippines, so they had to depart aboard the Kasumi. They left the fruits of their hard work in the Philippines. The U.S. order to freeze Japanese funds has shattered the efforts of many Japanese nationals in the Philippines in their lifetime. However, more than 20,000 Japanese nationals engaged in ramie farming in Davao in the Philippines will not return to Japan. There are still 6,000 Japanese nationals in Manila who must find a way to withdraw, because there will be no more French ships sailing between Manila and Shanghai in the future. After the United States issued the freezing order, Japanese nationals encountered many difficulties, such as each Japanese national being allowed to take out only 25 pesos (approximately 55 Japanese yen), which is one example. The group of Japanese nationals is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th and 30th of this month aboard two Japanese ships to return to their country.</p>
<p>Dutch Ship Arrives in Shanghai to Prepare for Evacuation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to a reliable source from the Dutch Company in Shanghai, the company's three major liners, including the Tjisaronea, were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next Monday. However, due to sheltering from the wind in Hong Kong, the voyage will be extended to Tuesday or Wednesday next week before it can arrive here. This ship is carrying a large amount of Dutch ponds and some rice. As for whether it will carry passengers when it returns to Java, it is reported that third-class deck tickets are being sold as usual, but first and second class cabins are not being provided for the time being and will depend on the situation after arrival in Shanghai. It depends mainly on whether it is decided to evacuate non-essential Dutch East Indies overseas Chinese residing in Shanghai at that time. Amid the tightening clouds in the Far East, the Japanese overseas Chinese have decided to evacuate a part of them, and the Dutch East Indies authorities are also prepared to take necessary measures.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Reader Bursary for the secondary and tertiary group has already ended, and the list has been announced. However, at the committee meeting on the 19th, several applicants were still considered to require review, and the review group was authorized to handle it. Now the review has been completed, and a total of eleven people have been approved for subsidies. In addition, the quota for the primary school group was reviewed and announced as early as the 15th. Among the unsuccessful applicants, Xia Mingfu, who was studying at Xinhua No. 2 Primary School, returned to his hometown of Chuansha, Pudong, during the holidays. Therefore, reporters from this newspaper visited him but did not meet him. Because there was a meat stall in his home, it was considered that his family was still well-off, so no subsidy was given. Recently, the student came to Shanghai accompanied by his mother and has been requesting this newspaper for days. Every time the student comes to the office, he cries and refuses to go back. The colleagues could not bear to disobey his wishes. Since his grades are all excellent, a special exception was made to approve the subsidy.</p>

<p>China Senior Vocational School Sets Up Free Places</p>
<p>China Senior Vocational School said in a letter, "Your newspaper is holding a reader bursary and launching a shop assistants' study movement, which can take care of vocational youth in addition to general students. The intention is thoughtful and admirable. Our school was founded at the beginning, and the school organization and student admission qualifications are in accordance with the regulations for senior vocational schools promulgated by the ministry. It is a formal vocational school, not a vocational training nature, but in order to facilitate vocational youth to study part-time, we offer courses at night for four hours a day, graduating in three years, with four departments: industrial and commercial management, accounting, civil engineering and construction, and traffic management. The chairman of the school board is Mr. Lu Gaoyi, and the school board members are Mr. Chen Xuanchan, Mr. Wang Peisun, and other gentlemen. Now we especially respond to your newspaper's shop assistants' study movement and are willing to contribute our modest efforts. We have specially set up ten completely free places and fifteen half-fee places. If it is proven by your newspaper's investigation and certification that they are indeed poor, and they are admitted through our school's entrance examination, they will be allowed to attend for free. We are pleased to inform you of this and hope you will take notice."</p>
<p>Nanyang Vocational School Twenty-Five Places</p>
<p>Nanyang Vocational Training School said in a letter, "Your newspaper is advocating a study movement, helping industry and commerce employees, and benefiting out-of-school youth, which is commendable.

All those who are interested in part-time tutoring and are certified by your newspaper as qualified may be recommended for admission."</p>
<p>Yada Wireless School Free of Charge</p>
<p>Yada Wireless Vocational School said in a letter, "The reader bursary organized by your newspaper benefits out-of-school youth, which is not shallow and commendable. Our school specially sets up four subsidized places, including two for the regular junior vocational course and two for the junior radio repair class, in order to provide support. All those who are interested in studying radio to seek employment, certified by your newspaper as indeed poor, can be recommended for free admission. We hope you will take notice."</p>

<p>Since doufu shops in this city raised their prices yesterday, the retail price of doufu is at least one jiao, which is twice as high as before. The industry ordered all doufu stalls to implement the new price. However, the stalls have not yet agreed because the price increase is too high. Therefore, the implementation of the industry's new prices yesterday has encountered considerable difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Shen Bao Reader Bursary Sets Up Industry and Commerce Employee Group, Shop Assistants and Apprentices Can Apply for Bursary <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>For several years, we have been accustomed to hearing the cry of "graduation equals unemployment", which is deeply worrying.</p>
<p>In the past month, we have been handling the Reader Bursary, and in turn, we have heard the call of "studying is difficult, graduation is even more difficult", which is even more heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Recently, because of handling the bursary, we have received letters from employees and apprentices of various companies, factories, firms, and shops, and we have heard the sincere cry of "employment equals illiteracy" and "insufficient knowledge, unable to study", which is even more sad!</p>
<p>As we come to a close in handling this bursary, we remember the suggestions of managers of various factories and firms, as well as the sincere requests for bursaries from employees in their letters. We checked the incoming letters and asked the bursary committee members. Many gentlemen among the donors from all walks of life are also concerned about vocational training education and earnestly urged us to handle it step by step. We should treat shop assistants and apprentices equally. We have specially set up an industry and commerce employee group and approved the allocation of 5,000 yuan for part-time tutoring bursaries for industry and commerce employees. We are relieved to be able to reassure the portion of donors who have expressed enthusiastic expectations, and we are happy that shop assistants and apprentices will not have to suffer in silence. We are deeply gratified.</p>
<p>The times are progressing rapidly, and competition in industry and commerce is becoming increasingly fierce. Today's industry and commerce employees are also the cornerstones of tomorrow's economic barriers. Among them are many people with good academic backgrounds, but there are also many who are urgently seeking knowledge and are currently self-studying, and even more who have difficult family circumstances, have been employed since childhood, have limited monthly income, and cannot afford to engage in part-time study. This time, the Shen Bao Reader Bursary has added an industry and commerce employee group in addition to the special college, middle school, and primary school groups, because we want to enable those who are eager to study but cannot afford tutoring to fulfill their desire for part-time study.</p>
<p>As for the application procedures, in addition to being published separately in this newspaper within days, the application form will be distributed as soon as it is printed. The most important thing is that the applicant must have the recommendation of the manager of the employer or the stamp of approval, that is, they must obtain the full consent of the person in charge of each employer, so as to obtain part-time study without affecting their employment and service. On the one hand, it will cultivate talents with both knowledge and experience that can be applied to each employer, and on the other hand, it will enable industry and commerce employees who are eager to study but are burdened by financial difficulties to achieve their ambitions. We deeply feel that our wishes are grand but our strength is weak. We especially hope that people from all walks of life, industry and commerce leaders, and gentlemen from various companies and firms will provide more support and work together to promote this, which we will be fortunate to have.</p>
<p>We would also like to state that regarding the funding for the industry and commerce employee group's bursary application, since 5,000 yuan has already been allocated from this newspaper's Reader Bursary according to the donors' request, there is no need for further donations from all walks of life at this time. We hope you will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Mails on Two American Liners Entirely Detained by the Japanese, Citing that it was Due to the Lifting of the Freeze Order, But After Negotiations, Delivery Permitted in the Next Two Days <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to information revealed here yesterday, when the American liners President Harrison and President Alexander arrived at the port, the American mails they carried were entirely detained by the local Japanese authorities. It is estimated that 412 bags of mail were detained from the Alexander and 345 bags from the President Harrison. Although postal authorities and other parties are unwilling to announce the details of the mail detention, it is learned from reliable sources that relevant parties have been negotiating for the past few days to have the mail released. Yesterday afternoon, it was said that the Japanese have agreed to "within a few days," or perhaps today or tomorrow, release the mail to the post office for delivery. It is reported that when the Japanese authorities made this promise, they provided an explanation, saying that the detention of the mail was due to a misunderstanding, and that the mistaken detention of the mail was due to subordinates misunderstanding the lifting of the freeze order. It has been rumored for days that the Japanese authorities have detained mail destined for the concession, but inquiries to all parties for confirmation have been met with either denials or vague responses. It was not until yesterday morning that the news of the mail detention was confirmed.</p>

It is reported that at 9:28 yesterday morning, two students from a certain school were walking out of No. 61, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, when suddenly four kidnappers lying in ambush there, each holding a pistol, rushed out and kidnapped the two students into a Xiang Sheng No. 18437 taxi and sped away. Afterwards, the families of the hostages reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station for investigation. It was not until around 3:00 PM that the police suddenly discovered that the hostages were being held by the bandits in Room 105 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road. Immediately, without making a sound, detectives were dispatched to rescue the hostages and arrest nine kidnappers on the spot. As of the time of writing, the investigating police were still continuing to arrest the criminals. It was later learned that the two hostages were Wang Jinquan, 22 years old, from Nantong, and Yan Xiangsheng, 21 years old, from Jiangsu.</p>

<p>On June 20th of this year, an American named Xue Fu and three others sailed a self-made sampan named Oynjo from Shanghai to the United States. According to a cable from Honolulu on August 22nd, the boat had battled fierce waves in the Pacific Ocean for a journey of 6,000 miles and arrived in Honolulu yesterday (August 21st). Xue Fu and the others were all exhausted. It is reported that they encountered severe weather many times during the voyage, making it difficult to navigate. After leaving Shanghai, the Oynjo went silent, but after thirty-eight days, news came that they had arrived at Midway Island to replenish fresh water and food and take a short rest. Xue Fu's wife, due to ill health, transferred to a liner at Midway Island and arrived in Honolulu first. However, after the Sen Qiao left Shanghai, it hired another crew member somewhere, so even though Xue Fu's wife had left earlier, there were still four people on board. The original plan was to continue sailing to San Francisco, but Xue Fu is a member of the US Naval Reserve and may soon be called up for active duty, so the adventurous voyage of the Oynjo will likely end in Honolulu. Those who left Shanghai with Xue Fu included his wife, Irishman Bao Huas, and American brothers Wei Xiongdai. Wei was originally a Western policeman in the Public Concession Police Department. He accompanied Xue Fu without notifying the police department beforehand, so he has been dismissed.</p>

It was not until around 9:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and all the shop staff had already gotten up, so no one was injured. However, all the pawned goods and business assets in the shop were completely destroyed. The damage is immeasurable. The upper floors of the two neighboring buildings at No. 524 and No. 528 were also partially burned, but the damage was still minor. The cause of the fire is currently being investigated by the police.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Confucius' Birthday and Teachers' Day <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>August 27th is Confucius' birthday and also the nationally designated Teachers' Day.</p>
<p>Children! You should know that Confucius was a great educator in our country. As early as more than 2,400 years ago, he taught people the "Six Arts." The so-called Six Arts are rites, music, archery, chariot driving, calligraphy, and mathematics, just like the civics training, music, physical education, work, calligraphy, and arithmetic subjects we learn now. He had three thousand students, of whom seventy-two were proficient in the Six Arts. This is the effect of Confucius' "patient instruction" and "untiring teaching," so later generations honored him as the "Most Sage Teacher."</p>
<p>His teachings are based on "benevolence." In terms of family, he emphasized "filial piety and brotherly love"; in terms of society, he advocated "loyalty and forbearance" as the way to conduct oneself. He reorganized six ancient books, including the Book of Poetry, Book of Documents, Book of Changes, Book of Rites, Book of Music, and Spring and Autumn Annals, adding to some, deleting others, and passing them on to later generations.</p>
<p>Confucius did not have a fixed teacher. As ancient books say, he "asked about officials from Tanzi, asked about music from Changhong, learned the qin from Shi Xiang, and asked about rites from Lao Dan." He was not ashamed to ask those below him and humbly accepted teaching, so he became a knowledgeable and versatile person. He also greatly admired Yao, Shun, King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou. He often dreamed of the Duke of Zhou.</p>
<p>Speaking of Teachers' Day, just like the May 1st "Labor Day," the April 4th "Children's Day," and the March 8th "Women's Day," each has its own great mission and important significance. Its history began in the 20th year of the Republic of China, initiated by the teachers themselves, designating June 6th as Teachers' Day. The purpose was to improve teachers' treatment, protect teachers' status, and enhance teachers' cultivation. Every year on this day, there are enthusiastic celebrations all over the country. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, the government formally stipulated August 27th, the commemoration of Confucius' birthday, as Teachers' Day, and all schools have a holiday to celebrate. This year is already the third Teachers' Day.</p>
<p>Now, designating Confucius' birthday as Teachers' Day is even more significant. Because Confucius is a model for all ages, his knowledge is profound, and his morality is noble, which is admired by everyone. He pioneered the practice of lecturing, regardless of social status, teaching without discrimination, and ordinary people have the opportunity to receive education. Moreover, he was able to teach according to aptitude and patiently instruct, which can be a model for general teachers. So, isn't it most appropriate to make his birthday the national Teachers' Day?</p>
<p>Children! Under these two important commemorations, on the one hand, we must emulate Confucius' spirit of diligent learning and asking questions widely, and strive to study hard; on the other hand, we should respect your teachers to repay the kindness of teaching you!</p>
<h3 id="e98">School Starts <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>In these few days, the children will probably be busy, some are busy with makeup exams, some are busy paying fees, some are busy buying school supplies, it is so lucky for the children to be so busy, can't you see the Shenbao scholarship movement, the many people asking for help, and their eagerness to study and the difficult situation they are in? However, some children do not know how rare the opportunity is and are unwilling to study hard. Why is it that a poor child can often be excellent in character and learning and achieve something in the future? It is not that their intelligence is particularly high, but that they can endure hardship and work hard. The ancient saying "Those who endure the bitterness of bitterness will become superior people" is true. They understand their future responsibilities even more, to be independent and to survive, they must be tempered from suffering and pain. Children, you are in a superior situation and live comfortably, but you must not be lazy and take shortcuts in your studies. You must obtain true knowledge through hard work and hard work. Do not abandon yourself, and strive to make progress. This is the first point I give to the children at the start of school.</p>
<p>The arrival of a new stage gives people an opportunity to renew themselves. At the beginning of the new semester, the children inevitably have new hopes, set new goals, and make new plans. In the beginning, they often gathered a general enthusiasm and did a good job with a group of joy. Later, they returned to the previous state. In addition to being impatient,</p>
<p>It must be that your hopes are too eager, your ambitions are too high, and your plans are too difficult to achieve! Then you will be discouraged. So, the second point I want to tell you is to study knowledge in a practical and down-to-earth way, from near to far, from easy to difficult, without seeking immediate results, and to have perseverance to achieve your ambitions and complete your plans.</p>
<p>The third point I want to tell the children is that we must protect books and cherish school supplies. At this time of rising prices, reducing an expense is reducing the burden on parents and saving the country's vitality.</p>
<p>One more thing that children should know when school starts is not to study by rote. Knowledge is everywhere. We must pay attention at all times, study carefully, read more newspapers, consult books, enrich our common sense, and expand our horizons.</p>
<p>School has started, and there are new students and classmates in the school, so lively. Encouraging each other according to the above four points, cheer up and start working together.</p>

<p>— Guo Minzhi</p>
<p>The vulture, moving close to the eagle's nest, said:</p>
<p>"By the authority of my name, hear me!"</p>
<p>"What do you want?" the eagle asked.</p>
<p>"I want to kill you and eat your flesh."</p>
<p>"Why do you want to harm me?"</p>
<p>"You are extremely foolish! I think you have absolutely no common sense. My nest is too small, so I want yours; this way, my children will have a place to grow up. Besides, I have my own vulture policy, you speak a different language, and your thoughts do not conform to me."</p>
<p>"The language I speak is given to me by God. Can you tell me why I should obey your will?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I only know that I have the right to kill and devour whatever opposes my opinion, and you are one of those to be killed and eaten."</p>
<p>"Then is there no way for me to escape this misfortune?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not, but if you can sacrifice yourself, it will be very glorious for you."</p>
<p>"Tell me, friend, where did you learn this kind of thinking? Who taught you?"</p>
<p>"What, you idiot," the vulture replied: "Don't you know that I studied under 南年 in the Berlin Zoo?"</p>
<h3 id="e101">White is Cool, Black is Hot <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>——What exactly is the reason?</p>
<p>The scorching sun is in the sky! The extreme heat is approaching! People are wearing "white" straw hats, "white" silk, "white" Wanzai (Wanzai County, Jiangxi summer cloth), "white" leather shoes, etc. Except for wearing "black" sunglasses, everything else needs to rely on "white"! Why is this? Those who know a little bit all say, "White" is cool, "black" is hot. But I want to repeat a question: What exactly is the reason? We need to know the principle that "white rejects heat" and "black absorbs heat." The scorching sun is "whitening" the heat! If you wear "black" clothes and a "black" straw hat, then because it absorbs heat, the heat will be everywhere, and the whole body will feel the threat of heat, and sweat like rain, which is very stuffy and unbearable. Conversely, wearing "white" can "reflect light and heat," and repel the heat back, in the transmission of air, the whole body will feel cool and comfortable. Also, in terms of psychological effect, seeing "white" makes people feel happy, and seeing "black" makes people feel disgusted, because the "white" of white snow is pure, and the "black" of black charcoal is turbid. "A calm heart is naturally cool," and the distinction between black and white is naturally not unrelated.</p>
<h3 id="e102">How to Make Mantou (Steamed Buns) <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Last Sunday, A Hui's mother made a lot of mantou, and they were very well made, comparable to the mantou bought on the market, but making them yourself is much cleaner, and the filling in the mantou can be whatever you want, sweet or salty, but it makes the mother a little busier. When it came time to eat lunch, they were taken out to replace lunch, and A Hui ate five in one breath. He felt they were delicious, probably because it was rare to eat them.</p>
<p>"Mom, it's also good to eat more pasta. Look, the northerners are strong and strong. Eating more pasta is one of the reasons. Besides, we eat rice every day, and it seems a bit greasy, and the price of rice is so high. Why don't we change the pattern and change the taste? Mom, can we eat mantou once every ten days?"</p>
<p>A Hui's mother also likes to cook and eat, so of course she agreed, and the mantou she made herself turned out very well. They were loose and white, and just looking at them made her feel happy, which comforted her a lot from her fatigue. She also gave a few of the leftover mantou to the neighbors, which further showed that her mantou-making skills were very superb, because the neighbors also often make mantou, and every time they make them, they always send a few for them to taste, but they are never as loose as those made by A Hui's mother. In this way, the two families seemed to be holding a mantou-making competition. Which one made them better? After all, the neighbors failed, so they came to ask A Hui's mother for the secret recipe for making mantou. She was also very willing to reveal the secret. It turns out that there is a certain method for making mantou, and a certain amount of flour and other accessories must be used to make delicious mantou, otherwise the results will definitely not be satisfactory.</p>
<p>"You must use yeast to make mantou. I bought it from a Western-style food company. It's wrapped in tin foil on the outside and looks like a piece of mushroom tofu, more than an inch square. Now the price has actually risen to two and a half jiao a piece. It's best to use it to make mantou. Other baking powders are not as good as it. Such a piece of yeast can be used for two jin of flour, plus a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of lard, three tablespoons of white sugar, and some warm water. These are the necessary materials for making mantou. Then dissolve the yeast in a bowl and mix it with warm water. Do not use just-boiled boiling water. Use another bowl, half a bowl of warm water, add salt, lard, and white sugar, and then mix it with the yeast liquid. Then sift the flour through a fine sieve and put it in a clean basin. Gradually pour in the yeast mixture and mix well. According to the temperature of the dough and the amount of flour, you can increase or decrease it at any time. This is called wet dough, and there is a lot of moisture inside. After half an hour, pour the wet dough on a board covered with dry flour, add some flour, and knead it by hand until the wet dough is soft and sticky. Then put the kneaded dough in a basin, cover it with a clean cloth, and put it in a warm place for three hours. The dough will rise up, and it will actually rise into a full basin, which is really interesting. At the same time, there is some alcoholic smell. At this time, you can wrap it with filling and make it into various styles of mantou, put it in a steamer, and steam it over boiling water. The mantou will rise even more and become loose and delicious. Is this how you do it?" The old woman said this long passage tirelessly, and she seemed to be smiling to show that she was victorious.</p>
<p>(Note: A letter from a child, Xu Guoliang, was forwarded by the editor, inquiring about the method of making mantou. This article is a response.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Allotropic Modifications of Carbon <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>When Hua Sheng was in common sense class today, the teacher taught a new lesson, entitled "Allotropic Modifications of Carbon." What are allotropic modifications? The same element can form objects with various different properties and shapes, which are called allotropic modifications, such as carbon, sulfur, and oxygen. The teacher said: "There are three kinds of allotropic modifications of carbon: one is the commonly seen charcoal, one is called graphite, the core of a pencil is made of graphite; the other is the most valuable thing in the world! Diamond." When Hua Sheng heard the words "diamond," he felt very strange. The value of diamond is really not comparable to that of charcoal. While Hua Sheng was doubtful, he heard the teacher say: "If diamond is heated with extremely high heat, it can be turned into charcoal."</p>
<p>Dear children! If you read this new lesson, what thoughts will arise in your mind? Diamond and charcoal are originally the same object, which can give you a great lesson! In the world, smart people are "people," and aren't stupid people also "people"? We want to be "diamonds," but we don't want to be "charcoal." I encourage you with these words, hoping that everyone can practice together!</p>

<p>Dear children, I'm going to introduce you to a good place to play, I think you must be very willing! Speaking of which, this place is called the Museum, and it is on Museum Road near Beijing Road. It doesn't require you to buy tickets like an amusement park, and it doesn't require any price, but the things displayed inside are mostly strange and weird things that you have never seen before; for example, the dragon chair that the emperor sits on! The battle robes worn by our country when going on expeditions in ancient times! As well as the bows and arrows used in ancient wars in our country! And even the shields and spears used by African natives seen in movies are there! Not only that, but there are also all kinds of birds and animals and many indescribable strange things, such as bears, sea dogs, platypuses, wolves, wild boars, ostriches, swans, turtles as big as basins... etc. In short, visiting once will not only broaden your horizons, but also increase your knowledge a lot.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Long-Missed Xu Li <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Lü</p>
<p>——His lover is Mei Zhen——</p>
<p>Xu Li gives people a deep impression on the stage. No matter what kind of role he plays, he never does things carelessly. In every play, his acting skills are always very hard and full of emotion. However, it was precisely because of this that he fell ill after acting in "Home." Haven't we not seen Xu Li's face on the stage for a long time? Some people say that Xu Li has withdrawn from the drama circle, which is definitely not true. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Xu Li, and he told me: "Drama is my second life, and acting is my lifelong career. I will always do it and will never leave the stage." The reason why he is not on stage now is because his body is still in a recuperation period. Probably soon he can still perform at the Juyi Society.</p>
<p>Xu Li is twenty-four years old this year, not married—and not even engaged. However, he has a lover, who is Ms. Mei Zhen, who plays Concubine Jin in the Tianfeng's performance of "The Grudge of the Qing Palace." They have only known each other for two years, but their love has reached a considerable level. During Xu Li's illness, Miss Mei Zhen served him almost every day. Look how "affectionate" they are!</p>
<p>Mei Zhen's original name was Wang Meizhen. Introduced by A Wu, she entered the Tianfeng Drama Society and changed her name to Mei Zhen. She is only twenty years old. She used to be a top student at the China Women's High School. She has a great passion for drama. Of course, since making friends with Mr. Xu, she has loved drama even more. Otherwise, how would she follow in her lover's footsteps and step onto the stage as well? Readers who have seen "The Grudge of the Qing Palace" probably know Mei Zhen's acting skills. It is not easy for a girl who has just stepped onto the stage to have such perfect acting skills. It's probably because of Xu Li's "good guidance"! In Tianfeng's next public performance—The Gold Rush—Mei Zhen also has an important role. I think her acting skills must be even better than this time. Finally, I can tell the readers that in the near future, Xu Li and Mei Zhen will bring us good news. "There is a 99% certainty that Mei Zhen will become Mrs. Xu," this is what Xu Li himself told me. Mr. Xu, please don't forget to invite me to your wedding banquet!</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Where a Powerful Family Forcibly Carries Her Away</p>
<p>The intelligent and resourceful Yuan Yuan was like an ant on a hot pot, with nowhere to hide and no way to escape. She stood there blankly, without saying a word. Yuan Yuan's stepmother went upstairs again at this moment, first thanking Tian Hongyu, and then saying: "My daughter will go with the old master of the state, naturally, she will be satisfied and harmonious for a hundred years. But according to my daughter's intention, it is best to postpone it for a day or two to take care of some housework, and then follow along. May I ask the old master of the state to be kind and agree?" The stepmother's few words were considered an explanation to Yuan Yuan, so as not to make Yuan Yuan complain. Yuan Yuan took advantage of the situation and said, "What my mother said is what I want to say. Please grant me a two-day deadline, and I will be immensely grateful." Before Tian Hongyu could answer, Hua Hudie (Butterfly) had already used his cunning eyes to size up the stepmother and Yuan Yuan, and搶着 said: "If Miss Yuan Yuan is willing to go with the old man, what else needs to be taken care of? Today is an auspicious day, and it should not be missed. If there is anything, just give an order, and someone will take care of it for you, so you don't have to bother at all. You must know that the state master's time is like gold, and it cannot be wasted casually. Today, the state master has prepared a painted boat, which is already docked outside the door. Why delay?" Tian Hongyu also said: "What Gao Xianzhi (Virtuous Nephew) said is very true. I really can't delay any longer. Yuan Yuan, you go with me quickly, and I will definitely not treat you badly." Yuan Yuan listened to their words and thought to herself, "It's over, it's over, my plan has failed! I'm afraid the lyricist doesn't know it yet." She was so anxious that her jade face changed color, and tears welled up in her eyelashes. Afraid of being seen by them, she had to lower her head and remain silent. Tian Hongyu wanted to welcome her back urgently and did not want to sit any longer, so he repeatedly urged Yuan Yuan to leave. Yuan Yuan was forced to have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth, and she refused to change her clothes and makeup. Hua Hudie (Butterfly) was a clever ghost. He knew that Yuan Yuan was somewhat unwilling, fearing that the good thing would be difficult to achieve, so he winked at Tian Hongyu, signaling with his eyes. Tian Hongyu leaned on the building window and yelled down for someone to come. Then, four maids and four servants came up the stairs together. They answered the call and stood aside, waiting for orders. (150)</p>
<h3 id="e109">A Quick Record of a Temporary Performance <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shiren</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jinghou, a prominent businessman in Shanghai, held a wedding ceremony for his son Yushan at his residence on Gordon Road a few days ago. Because the country is in trouble and it is an extraordinary time, relatives and friends wanted to prepare a grand amateur opera performance for him, but he politely declined. Only a few ballad and comedy troupes were invited to entertain guests, and guests felt bored for two consecutive days. Later, after repeated persuasion from relatives and friends, it was decided on the evening of the 18th to establish a Peking opera performance within two hours, limited to the participation of relatives and friends who are good at Peking opera and interested in performing, so as to entertain both guests and hosts.</p>
<p>That night, due to the late arrival of the troupe, the gong was not struck until 12 o'clock late at night. The opening play was "Sang Yuan Hui" (Meeting at the Mulberry Garden). Mr. Wu Xueqiao's stage presence was steady and his singing and recitation were skillful, worthy of being an experienced amateur performer. Luo Fu, played by Mrs. Xu, had a beautiful appearance and delicate expressions. The movements during mulberry picking and the water sleeves when entering the stage were all very beautiful. The first act was "Mading" (Scolding the Palace) by a certain lady, followed by "Zuo Gong" (Sitting in the Palace). Huang Hanxiang's Si Lang had a broad and mellow voice, and his singing and pronunciation all followed the rules. Wu Jun's princess was dignified and luxurious, with the style of Wan Hua. Several slow tempos were sung with melodious warbling, and the audience was filled with applause. Next was "Zhuo Fang Cao" (Catching and Releasing Cao) by the humble one, stumbling onto the stage with tired eyes. It was midnight, and the night was silent. Due to poor spirits, the performance ended hastily. The finale was Hu Qishan's "Shi Jieting Kongchengji" (Losing Jieting and Empty City Stratagem), but without beheading Ma Su. This old man is a friend of mine, although he is nearly sixty years old, he is still full of energy, as if he were young and strong. He was able to shoulder this big play even after not sleeping for two nights. His performance was full of spirit, and his demeanor was like that of Zhuge Liang reborn. I, as a younger generation, am ashamed that I am not as good as him. The final act was Sun Junqing's "Qun Chen Yan" (Feast of the Ministers). His dashing manner, his standard movements, the well-arranged drumbeats, and his elegant and refined singing and recitation were all amazing. Junqing's laosheng (old male) role is of course unmatched among amateur performers, and even among professional performers, it is rare. It is a pity that he is too superstitious about what his teacher taught him, so inverted words and southern accents are still unavoidable. With Junqing's extraordinary talent and hard work, if he could get a master to guide him again, in this time of talent scarcity, he would be able to hold the reins of the laosheng in both the amateur and professional circles. That night, Junqing told me that he intended to go to Ping (Beijing) to study under Shu Yan's door when the situation was a little more peaceful. Aspiration is bound to succeed, and I wish to encourage him.</p>

<p>— Zheng Guoyi, Zhang Yizhang, Wrote Biography and Made Pictures</p>
<p>(33) Xi Xiaobo</p>
<p>Xi Xiaobo, a Manchu (or it is said that Xi is the grandson of Yulu, the Governor-General of Zhili during the late Qing Dynasty), also went to sea as an amateur performer. In the last few years of Mei Lanfang's performance in other places, his second-tier laosheng (old male role) often brought Xiaobo, and Xiaobo used this to increase his reputation a lot. After Lanfang and Xiaobo performed at the Great Shanghai and Tianchan stages, they never ascended the red carpet together again, and Xiaobo returned to Ping (Beijing) and formed his own troupe, no longer dependent on other dan (female) roles. Xiaobo's voice is extremely clear and beautiful (but it is suspected of being slightly skewed). He has a good relationship with the audience. Recently, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Yang Baosen, and Xi Xiaobo were regarded as the four diamond kings of laosheng in the old capital. Although Xiaobo's name is listed, Ma, Tan, and Baosen have all experienced hardships and setbacks to have today; while Xiaobo ascended to the sky in one step, and laid a solid foundation without encountering root problems; among his peers, his early success and good fortune are almost unmatched. When Xiaobo was an amateur performer, he studied under Yan Jupeng, and then learned from Ma Lianliang. He combined and adopted both to form his own style, but he did not reveal his strength very much, so there were no traces of axe chiseling at the beginning. This is naturally where his intelligence is superior. However, with Xiaobo's talent, if he can work hard and make continuous progress, he can be expected to surpass the top level. But he is limited in his knowledge and experience, and his origins are not far away, so his achievements stop there. Although he has fortunately succeeded, it is ultimately a pity.</p>
