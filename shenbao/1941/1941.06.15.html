<p>社評</p>
<h3>從石油糧食問題談到德蘇關係</h3>
<p>自從去年六月法國停戰之日起，放在希特勒面前的，祇有兩條路：一是利用閃電戰術，把英國迅速擊敗；二是逐漸控制整個歐陸，樹立所謂「歐洲新秩序」，以期政治上經濟上處於力足應付長期戰爭的地位。也許由於現實的困難，他終於走上了第二條路，費了將近一年的光陰，總算把整個東南歐洲征服，但是他心目中的「新秩序」，却距離實現之期依然很遠。</p>
<p>所謂「歐洲新秩序」就政治上講，必須參加各國都受德國的絕對控制，就經濟上言，至少須在資源方面，能以自給自足。按之事實，歐洲國家儘管什九已在軸心控制之下，但杲經濟還是不能「獨立自主」，尤其是石油和糧食兩項的供求，還是不能得到滿意解決。</p>
<p>據專家估計，德義兩國和其所控制各國的石油消費量，連軍用和民用一起在內，至少每年須在兩千萬噸以上；至於供給方面，除德國可產石油和人造石油四百餘萬噸，羅馬尼亞可產六百萬噸外，不足之數至少當在一千萬噸左右。蘇聯在世界產油國中雖居第一位，但事實上她可能輸出的油量，一九三九年不過六十萬噸，去年或許較多，但也絕對不會在兩百萬噸以上。德國在過去一年中所以還沒有感到油荒者，一方固因國內尙有四百五十萬噸的囤積，一方則因曾在法比荷挪丹各國掠得不少存油；今後雖不妨將各地民用油量减至最少限度，但以德國利用空軍和機械化部隊作戰之甚，其常年軍用油量，至少也在一千萬噸以上，義大利至少也需要二百五十萬噸，然則不論此後是否需要長期作戰，苟無新的補充，難免又要重蹈上次歐戰因油源枯竭而不得不棄戰乞和的覆轍。德國取得石油接濟的最佳目標，當然是中東的伊朗和伊拉克，因爲前者產油一千一百萬噸，後者產油四百三十萬噸；足敷軸心國的需要而有餘，但是最近伊拉克變亂的奠定，以及英國在叙利亞的捷足先登，已證明希特勒掠奪中東油田的計劃，急切尙不易實現，於是最便捷最有效的辦法，祗有設法脅迫蘇聯，在她所年產的二千八百萬噸石油中，多分出一點供給德國。</p>
<p>關於糧食分配情形，戰前西歐各國如法蘭西，比利時，荷蘭，西班牙，葡萄牙諸國，無不依賴海外供給，自從英國海軍實施封鎖之後，海外的糧源差不多已全部斷絕；至於中歐和東南歐各國，平時雖有餘糧可供出口，但據專家估計，自軍興以來，由於壯丁人伍，農事荒廢，以及農村破壞等等原因，本年產量當較戰前减少百分之四十；果爾，則其所可接濟西歐的剩餘糧食，爲數自亦遠不若戰前之多，觀於西歐各戰敗國乃至德義兩國自身的相繼實施麵包消費限額制，可見歐洲糧荒的危機，始終還未完全解除。軸心國一方旣因英國的封鎖，而無法自海外取得糧源，另一方面則又苦於菲洲和近東的爭奪緩不濟急，在這種情勢之下，當然又不禁要轉念到蘇聯這個龐大農業國。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見英相邱吉爾前此大聲疾呼，說德國即將染指鳥克蘭的糧庫和高加索的油田，雖不免言之過早，但却絕對不算危詞聳聽。姑為德國設想，目下既無法迅速攻克英倫三島，今後自不能不覓一「以戰養戰」之道，藉以應付長期作戰的無限需要；希特勒在歐洲大陸的擴展，雖已到了飽和點，但他在資源方面，却依然不能自給自足；他在近東北菲之急切不易得手既如此，其需要補充物資尤其是補充石油又如彼，在急於樹立所謂「新秩序」的要求之下。「友好的蘇聯」當然成了他「最近便的目標」。盛傳德國業向蘇聯邊境集中，却是無可諱言的事實，（塔斯社說是調動性質），目前雖不敢說希特勒已準備進攻蘇聯，但至少可以推想他在利用「陳兵邊境」的老法子，脅迫莫斯科在各方面尤其是在經濟方面，作進一步的「合作」，藉以解救他的「燃眉之急」：萬一蘇聯堅持不肯讓步，說不定也許馬上翻臉！在這種情勢之下，吾人不禁要替這繼莫洛托夫而親自臨政的史丹林担擾，因為吾人早已感覺蘇聯過去所推行的對德妥協政策，非獨沒有把侵略威脅趕開，反而愈招愈近，事實上這種「妥協合作」的局面，也許早已到了「盡頭處」，今後如果再作更進一步的妥協，等於淪爲德國附庸，如果堅持不妥協，則又難免捲入戰渦，如果說一九三九年八月是德蘇親交的起點，那麼一九四一年的六月至少已是德蘇關係的重大轉捩點。</p>

<h3>德蘇關係緊張說　蘇聯鄭重否認　雙方均能信守不侵約　德未向蘇提任何要求</h3>
<p>塔斯社十四日莫斯科　在英國駐蘇大使克利浦斯未返倫敦前、尤其是克氏抵達倫敦後、英國及其他外國報紙極力散播「蘇德即將開戰」之謠言、此種謠言可分爲三類、（一）德向蘇聯提出領土及經濟要求、目前雙方正在進行談判、以便締結更密切之新協定、（二）蘇聯已拒絕此種要求、因此德方已開始在蘇聯邊境集中大量軍隊、準備向蘇聯進攻、（三）蘇聯緊急備戰、已陳兵德國邊境、上項謠言果屬荒謬絕倫、但莫斯科負責方面認爲有辯正之必要、職是之故、彼等已授權塔斯社鄭重聲明、此項謠言純係仇視蘇德　國及力謀擴大戰爭方面之愚蠢有計劃宣言、</p>
<p>塔斯社宣稱、（一）德方旣未向蘇提出要求、亦未建誠締結更密切之新協定、因此雙方絕未進行關於此方面之談判、（二）據蘇聯所獲情報、德國與蘇聯同樣的忠實遵守蘇德不侵犯公約、職是之故、蘇聯方面認爲外傳德將毀約攻蘇一節、實屬無稽之談、至於德軍由巴爾幹調回德國東部及東北部一事、諒有其他動機、與蘇德關係無關、（三）蘇聯為追隨其和平政策、無論以往或將來、決遵守蘇德不侵犯公的之條款、由是觀之、所謂蘇聯準備與德作戰云云、實係一種僞造及挑撥性之謠言、（四）目前及最近將來紅軍所舉行之夏季演習、目的純係訓練後備隊、並檢查鐵路工作、此係每年之經常行動、外傳紅軍此種活動係對付德國、實屬荒謬絕倫之謠言、</p>

<p>路透社十四日開羅電　今日總部公報述及大馬色之情形時、謂自由法軍顯已放棄其奪取基期威陣地之企圖、並謀包抄其東法軍之抵抗、</p>
<p>路透社十四日倫敦電　據官方宣布叙利亞之維希軍隊已退出大馬色一十哩之基斯威、合衆社十四日倫敦電歷史古城大馬色之運命、似已繫於法駐叙官員鄧資將軍與埃及英軍總司令威爾森中將雙方代表之談話如何而定、因此間英軍事及航空專家今日均對德機羣是吾有開始活動之可能發生揣測、若輩預料英德空軍或將在叙里亞沿海一帶上空發生衝突、此次衝突果然發生、或將爲德　猛炸叙里亞作戰英軍之序幕、來自近東之英國消息、大致均料法人將繼續戰事以保守此古代回敎城市、但若干人士吾認此說、而料該城將宣布爲不設防城市、或竟投降亦未可知、聞威爾森將軍以其所統率之軍隊三隊、已將大馬色包圍、此舉似欲示知維希以局勢業已無望、俾法人可以該城投降而免流血之慘云、</p>
<p>叙利亞海岸外　發生激烈空戰</p>

<h3>維希政府媚德　赫爾嚴詞譴責　認英軍入叙確有理由　美法兩國癢係趨惡化</h3>

<p>合衆社十四日華盛頓電　自昨日美國務卿赫爾發表譴責法協理達蘭及法前協理賴伐爾採取親德政策之言論後、美國與維希關係惡化之憑證、今日已趨顯明、赫爾於向公衆發表之言論及致維希之通牒中、所謂美國對法國民衆非常　懷、但認法國之領袖、業在領導民衆入於與德合作之錯路、直至現在止、美國迄在努力維持此業經變爲冷淡之美法關係、國務部以前運送食糧至法國及瑪丁尼格之舉、以及不施行任何斷然行動如佔領有利於加勒比海方面美國國防之瑪丁尼格等、曾頗受人們之責難、甚至有謂美國係在「綏和」維希者、此外美國曾對本國及外國各軍事學家主張美國佔領達加爾、以行使其自衛權一節、予以拒絕、又美國現已繼續以政府最幹練人才之一、卽曾任海軍作戰部長及波多黎各總督之李希上將駐留維希、然美法關係自貝當元帥最近宣佈與德合作之政策以來、非常冷淡、赫爾言論中又指責德國爲目下叙里亞戰事之主動者、赫爾對維希政策之强烈言論、不先不後乃在全國人士因德方擊沉「羅賓糜爾」號向多少表示反德以及政府正在表示增加民中國援助並在自行準備萬一之際發表、是乃大可注意者、但此間預料召回李希及美法絕交兩事、恐國務部尚須續予縝密之考慮云、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市終疲　聊慰人心</h3>
<p>工部局洋米接連而來、太古公司太原輪、昨午抵滬由香港裝來工部局洋米一萬包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、怡和洋行裕生輪亦於昨日下午到埠、由香港運來大批洋米二萬一千包、其中一萬包、亦工部局之洋米、其餘均係客貨、聞今日有大批洋米由仰光運來、係裝華綸洋行經理之某美輪、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨日在盤旋中微見上砌、早市因公賣港米到定兩多、人心軟弱、市價甚疲、繼因鄕莊內地各　續有趁平吸收、尤以期現碎米最見活潑、終以洋米續有台義拋出一二號混合碎二千噸、價祇一百〇二元三角、浮多散戶亦有出籠、市乃復平、結果祇碎米有客戶搬運仍較漲一元二元、其他均祇微砌數角及近元而已、英華司現碎米開一百〇八元、跌一百〇七元、四五月期一百〇六元半、小絞現貨一百三十八元、成交仍有近千噸、現米因有客化亦開一萬五六千包、碎米高貨九十四元三角、次七十九元二角、一號西貢自一百十九元至一百十六元、二號一百十四元至一百十元、暹羅一號高一百廿三允、决一百十四元、二號一百〇九元半、敏黨一百廿二元次至一百十五元半、小絞一百十四元半至一百十二元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米續在銷淡鬆脫、市面繼難維持、父見貶低元砠、開南港新鮮早晚稻一百卅三元半、次至百卅二元、宿百卅元至百廿八元、惟無錫原包宿粳、因價格已賤、貨中痛惜身本、不願再貶勉爲站住、未有軒輊、猶售百廿元、百十八元、</p>
<p>糯米市自兩朝回低後、懷貨者以後貨無　、無意再事輕脫、是雖去路有限、市面未有變化、轉呈定局、繼開香港團粒元百十四元、團長粒百十二元半、中關百十一元百十元，次百〇七元、糯菉特自百〇六元、次至百〇二元、國元百廿元次至百十六元、</p>
<h3>麫粉本客　擇廉而取</h3>
<p>洋粉續呈盤旋、本客實銷、雖不寂寞、而吃盤重視、大都擇巧而取、兼之新麥上市、執貨者亦無法過於扳俏、更有零星浮囤參加其間、逢高即有回出、金龍粉流通籌碼最多、初開二十九元三角半、旋即售小至一角半、收市仍售二十九元三角、惟花鳥及鐘樓牌澳粉則以存底寥寥、獨爲堅俏、花鳥粉開過三十一元一角、財神粉二十九元、統市成交一萬餘包、由本客各半辦去、聞華廠平賣粉因原料將罄、將於二十六日終止發售、故木街門莊需要者、均有添辦之意、</p>
<p>小麥交易、仍無正市、查內地新麥、雖已旺登、而通運依然絕望、僅有日粉廠出面請領少數採辦證、華商則已無法購取、故常錫丹陽及浦東等處之麥商、已與日廠接洽拋訂路期貨併計一萬五千餘包、作價四十元、由華商代辦運滬、正在陸續啟裝、</p>
<h3>油餅　多頭復起　豆餅市面紊亂</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、因傳產地小熟欠收、有統制黃豆搬出之訊、故不免引起多頭慾熖、但空方見解不同、仍不乏乘機吐售、致檯面紊亂、行情乍升乍降、變化多端、結果近期在實銷淡漠下、依然疲軟、遠期投機做作、比上日漲起三角、（在最俏時曾砌五角）、共計成交二萬餘片、開甡記四月份棧單現餅價爲十七元三角至五角、五月上棧單六月上交價爲十七元六角至八角、五月下棧單六月上交價六十七元七角至七角半、六月上棧單六月下交價爲十八元八角至十九元三角、收盤價爲十九元二角云、</p>

<p>謹啟者、閱本月十三日貴報商業新聞、關於木業期糖結價辦法、迄未對外公開發表一則、殊有失實之處、查此事之發生起於本月五日、其原因爲是日糖價上落相差太鋸、賣買之問突起糾紛、本會鑒於情勢之嚴重、殊非同業之福、爲謀解決會昌糾紛、安定同業起見、不得已宣告暫行停市、一面迭經開會集議、採納公衆意見、議决兩全救濟辦法、同業亦一致認爲公允、業於本月七日及十一日在本業市塲公布兩期抑價了結辦法、執行總交割辦理了結手續、所幸同業間均能顧全大體、手續堪稱順利、而本會苦心孤詣之處、常爲各方所諒解、茲因刋載前項新聞者、雖經公布尚有未盡瞭解之處、茲特抄附公告辦法兩紙、敬希借貴報一角地位予以發表、相應函達即希察照辦理、實紉公誼、上海市糖業同業公會</p>
<p>（一）六月十日期粗糖結價了結辦法如下、成交價一〇三元以上、按成交一概减低價每担五元計算、一〇二元至一〇二元九角半、减每担四元五角、一〇一元至一〇一元九角半减四元、一〇〇元至一〇〇元九角半减二元五角、九十九元至九十九元九角半减二元、九十八元至九十八元九角半减二元五角、九十七元至九十七元九角半减二元、九十六元至九十六元五角半减一元五角、九十五元至九十五元五角半减一元、九十三元半至九十四元九角半减五角、九十三元角五分至四角半、及九十三元以下、概作九十三元計算、</p>
<p>（二）六月二十期組糖結價了結辦法、九十八元至九十八元九角半、照成交價每担减價二元一角半、九十七元至九十七元九角半减一元七角半、九十六元至九十六元九角半减一元二角半、九十四元〇五分至九十四元七角半、概作九十四元結價計算、十日與二十日期粗原戶互相掉期者、其貼價金無論一元或一元以上者、應將該項原貼價予以返還、二十日期粗價定價爲九十四元、貼價有餘返還、不足找繳、</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍弱、復見下降、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白、外棧新貨爲九十元至八十九元、跌二元半、四月份入口八十七元九角·七角·五角、三月份入口八十七元、跌二元半至三元、荷赤七十元五角至六十九元、小一元半、太古車白B嘜一百〇八元、DY嘜九十五元、均乏上落、HX喀初平後軟、爲八十八元五角·三角·至八十八元、小五角、餘乏成交、十四日有糖二百九十包、自香港米、</p>
<p>洋糖近以供過於求、故市存日見增厚、查荷赤粗白一項、爲數最多、共達二十三萬六千〇六十六包、香港來者尚在外、連太古車糖等共達三十七萬三千五百六十六包、茲將各檔詳列於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　廠根緊　紗價再上　雙馬續有出口　浮空抵補轉殷</h3>
<p>紗市由盤旋而續趨向上、此因廠單根子緊迫關係、同時有人說、廣幫向小公司方面借去棧單的有三四百包、向廠方掉取現貨、裝運出口之說、於是人心尤振、浮空紛起抵補、市盤帶緊而漲、目前紗市悄况向上檔口進、然小公司中大都拋空之額量頗鉅、扒補之念稍見活動也、所以照此觀測、雙馬廠單尚有漲風、如果直升至一千五百元左右、恐有一度小反動也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百七十八元、低價爲一千四百六十五元、午後因週未停止集會、有人說一千四百七十七八元要進云、今日有棉紗五百九十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市象尚平靜、首盤價為一千四百六十五元、此價一開、買者興趣仍濃、少頃漲至一千四百七十二元、塲內說港幫又辦雙馬數百包、人心突緊、買聲大震、漲至一千四百七十八元、豈料標金掉期後較爲軟化、盈利者出籠忽然回挫至一千四百七十元、收盤回好一步爲一千四百七十五元、查半日間成交統計九千四百包、內香港幫進一百包、同行九千三百包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗市况、微見良好、價格徐徐而升、查七月期漲四元牛、八月期勿動、查全日成交統計四千多包、午後停止營業、茲將其高低及收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>中外紗廠　競買巴西棉</h3>
<p>現棉情况、堅挺萬丈、此因美棉一味上升、致細絨棉有升無降、同時德國向滬購求美棉時時不斷、因之人心激昂矣、至昨日交易因週末關係較上日减少、加之細絨價格買方雖嫌過昂、然持貨者猶嫌不足、是以廠　對粗絨原料漸漸注意、號家亦步塵於後、交易漸增、昨共計二千零九十五件、又四千二百七十八包、細絨漲一二元、粗絨平定、</p>
<p>火機草包　一九八　申新九廠　四、〇〇〇包　送廠</p>

<p>巴西花　　一二·五　號家　二〇〇件　棧交</p>
<p>惠司登　三三六·五　號家　五九五件　棧交</p>
<p>另訊港埠洋行外棉交易、似因各方人心興奮、及美印棉脚地堅實、而分外活躍、昨日雖屆週末、但半日間亦成交千包以上、其中巴西花更成衆矢之的、各外商紗廠皆有大批購定、同時花號家不甘示弱、小額交易情况良好也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因氣候報告不利多頭而跌、但續後又因同業買進、及空頭抵補而回漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲十五六磅音、</p>
<p>又電去年八月一日起至今年六月十三日止、美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>

<p>各港市存　五、七八一、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因大衆購買頗力而漲、續後又因一部分獲利了結、及散戶賣出而稍跌、昨日收盤價格、除白洛去七八月份跌〇·七羅比外、其餘各漲二至七羅比不等、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况看漲羅比、</p>
<h3>證劵　銀根鬆濫　內債又轉上峰</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市又轉上峰、各幫買進頗見踴躍、市氣極佳、傳言又有和平消息、並有减低利息之說、屆此銀根鬆濫之際、銀行仍在繼續買進、多方加碼、空方抵補、一時　起、鴻大雖有出籠、供求仍不均衡、內種一度再衝出七十元大關、因漲之過速、仍行退進、第十一屆利息、漸漸到期、空方咸有戒心，所以現在放空者、適與老空頭抵補之機會、故走勢漲易跌難、前途仍將繼續看好、蓋空方希望得機補進者、尚大有人在也、昨爲週六、祇做一盤、開盤內種即開七十元、聯和鑫源餘大恒孚紛紛買進、信孚和豐加碼、生大鼎康協康補空、德半怡泰公茂多頭出籠、潤德亦有了結、鴻大先進後出、益昌久豐仁豐均有賣出、裕與及恒康出甲種、其中以餘大代某銀行連日搜購爲最、堪注實競爭、結果一律回高一角至三角半、成交的一百五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝產價漲</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝本屆收成甚歉、已成事實、故產價亦昂、劃申成本較陳貨須高起三分之一、查陳貨申存尸屬有限、但現在霉令已屆、經過冷藏或烘焙之後、成本至少亦需增起一二十元、因此行方售盤、隨之叫升矣、</p>

<h3>日無大舉南進意嚮　目的在不斷滋擾　牽制英美軍隊暗助軸心　但馬來亞荷印實力堅強　美記者凱恩歸滬分析南太平洋局勢</h3>
<p>美國紐約通報訪員凱恩氏、三月間離滬、經香港赴南洋察訪馬尼剌與新加坡等地、歷時四月、甫循原　返此、向某記者談　、據馬尼刺美負責軍事觀察家之意、日本在南太平洋之整個政策、厥爲不斷滋擾、使英美與荷印當局恒以遭海陸兩路侵犯爲慮、因而將美國太平洋艦隊牽制於珍珠港中、並使數萬英軍留滯於馬來、而此等軍隊若調往其他戰區與軸心軍交戰、乃一重要之因素、</p>
<p>德意迫使　捲入漩渦</p>
<p>該觀察家復討論迭傳希特勒與墨索里尼圖迫日本在南太平洋對英美作戰之說、以爲日本現正興風作浪、使南洋局勢臻於除確實開戰以外之最緊張狀態、藉以履行其對軸心國之最大協助、</p>

<p>凱恩繼稱、當渠離新加坡時、該地一般人之感覺爲日本不致在南洋區作攻擊企圖、若德國能在中申獲絕大務　、而得蘇彝士運河、則日本或　乘機用兵、經新加坡而取荷印、六閱月前、英屬馬來與荷屬東印度防務未可稱强、尤以空防爲弱、但今已大非昔比、該兩地防務異常堅强、</p>
<p>空防加強　美機運到</p>
<p>六閱月前、馬來亞無驅逐機、僅有白侖漢式戰鬥轟炸機、洛克希赫特遜轟炸機及他種英造轟炸機、但此缺點、過去數月來、已予補救、運入大批美國白魯斯德勃發羅式戰鬥機、駐該地之英空軍駕駛員、皆讚此式美機之迅速與靈活、若干駕駛員且謂此式戰鬥機在萬呎以下天空作戰、較英國著名噴火式戰鬥機更爲靈便、僅火力較差耳、馬來方面近更有澳洲威頓惠式俯衝轟炸機運到皆係單座乃澳洲　照美國之圖樣造成者、</p>
<p>抵抗侵略　綽有餘裕</p>
<p>馬來現有澳正規軍駐防　其第一批於月間開到、更有澳空軍一隊、早已開抵馬來、駐某大機塲、紐西蘭人亦在英澳空軍中服役、此外、美國軍火亦已大量運抵新加坡、陸空兩軍旣已大增、軍事觀察家乃覺　屬馬來之防務、以抗日方派往攻擊之軍隊、游刃有餘、</p>
<p>美英荷印　聯合陣線</p>
<p>凱恩又稱、美英海軍合作防衛新加坡事、雖未有訂約之宣布、然一般人均信兩國已獲互相諒解、此乃遏制日本覬覦南太平洋之强大力的因素、渠此行未遊荷印、但聞可靠消息、知該地軍事防務與空軍、半載來已大事增强、渠遊菲島亦見　隊與各式飛機大批開到、防務益臻堅强、據菲島美觀察家之　、日本長此有南犯可能、美國之太平洋艦隊決不致調人大西洋、</p>
<p>新闢航綫　暢通各</p>
<p>關於美國飛剪號飛機開航新加坡事、凱恩聲稱、此舉使新加坡郵件寄往美國者、從三週至匝月减至六天、寄往英國者、從三月减至十二天左右、新加坡旣有飛剪號業務接通、該地遂成遠東主要航空中心地之一、以　有荷·英·美商飛機、連接荷印·南非·澳洲·紐西蘭·印度與暹邏也、凱恩末稱、三四月開渠在新加坡時、美國各大通訊社報紙雜誌及新聞影片公司皆有代表赴新加坡採　材料、</p>

<h3>凱自威在美活動　調整遠東航業　抽調各綫船隻供英軍運</h3>
<p>據本埠英商航業界方面可靠消息、怡和洋行為經理即前任工部局總董凱目威（W.J.Keswick）氏、自今年四月二十五日以返國探望夫人爲辭、搭柯立芝總統號赴美後頃正在美華盛頓主持太平洋及印度洋上英·美·澳。華·商輪重行調遣分配之計劃、以擴充大西洋上英輪船隻、維持英美大西洋交通運輸之「生命綫」、</p>
<p>滬港航商　全力供應</p>
<p>據悉凱氏所進行之計劃、　將完成、氏曾與英國航務委員會美國務院及遠柬航業專家多人磋商辦法、氏本人復代表遠東英國航業界負責接洽、深信凱氏在美曾向有關當局明白表示、上海與香港之航業界、願作任何必要之犧牲、以維持英國交通之所需、</p>
<p>英希船隻　調大西洋</p>
<p>據稱目前正在研討之計劃、即將現仍在經營遠東貿易之英希奧船隻抽調赴大西洋航行、另以美國式中國之商船、代行遠東航綫、庶幾遠東傳統之航運、不受嚴重影響、此等船隻之抽調、將包括現下行駛日·印·及日華間之英商船隻、另以中國之海船或貨輪行駛央輪原有航綫之一部、以維貿易而保利益、同時太平洋上之昌興輪船公司之皇后輪、亦一律停舫、調往大西洋或具他一屬地、充屬軍用、</p>
<p>美國船隻　代替英輪</p>
<p>至太平洋上美國航業、雖船隻因政府之徵爲軍用而見减少、但仍有充分之數量、以供替代英輪之用、此種船隻調遣計劃之目的、端在增加船數、以運載急需物品自美輸英及中東、以减輕美國中立法之約束力、使英國仍得有喘息之餘地、</p>
<p>大批新輪　在趕造中</p>
<p>同時美國政府刻正趕造新輪、以應付援英援華運輸上之需要，現有七千五百噸之貨輪二百艘、在美全國各地船塢趕造中、所費達二萬萬美金、預計年內完成分配大西·太平·兩洋、以充船隻之不足、又美國郵船公司亦正趕築尚未完成之世界班新輪三隻、籍以維持船艘被徵軍由後之遠東英一航業、新聞社記者曾以此種計劃　諸本埠怡和洋行·美國郵船公司·以及昌興輪船公司、但皆休守緘默、拒不批評、唯衆認無論如何、凱自威在美接洽之使命、與該三公司實有密切之關係也、</p>

<p>小絞敏黨　兼行採辦</p>
<p>昨報載新聲社消息、香港接濟滬市米糧、將改用敏黨米、並核减售價、引起米業界紛向平米代辦機關訊問、昨據負責人語平明社記者云、（一）工部局爲澈底解決本埠民食恐慌、故在辦理小絞米之外、兼辦敏黨米、並非因小絞米之不足、而改易敏黨米、不過此後小絞米與敏黨米兼收並蓄、以小絞米來則小絞米應售、以敏黨米來則敏黨米應市而已、（二）至於外傳工部局兼辦之敏黨米、在滬發售價格、將再度抑低一層、更屬無稽、查敏黨米發售價格、業經工部局會同平米代辦機關議定、躉售與批發行、每包爲一百二十七二角、批發行售與零售米號每包不得超過一百三十六元二角五分、各零售米號門售價格、規定每石爲一百十二元、何有所謂再度抑低、（三）此項特別敏黨米、係本月份開始裝船啟運、亦無須待至下月（七月）始爲首批、現在工部局對採辦敏黨米情形、尚未發表、故此中究竟、尚難確悉也、</p>

<h3>巴拿馬大舉排華　僑胞陳述意見　滬港兩地回國僑胞聯電　請挽由美當局居間消弭</h3>
<p>中美洲巴拿馬國自去年底在國會通過一條例、指明禁止中國人入境、並對土生華僑子女取銷其一切巴國國籍權利、事態發展辛今、極爲嚴重、最沂我當地僑胞因環境所迫、返國者至今已有五批、其第五批計一百七十三人、方於日前乘美國郵船公司克利扶倫總統號返國、而今仍留該地候輪返國者、尚有數百人之多、記者昨特訪抵滬不久之巴拿馬華僑某君、承告該地排華之</p>
<p>事實經過</p>
<p>綠巴拿馬排僑風潮、發生於巴拿馬政府提倡排除有色人種、實行「巴拿馬人之巴拿馬」主義下所造成者、所謂此種主義、主在對我華僑、首於一九三〇年、訂移民法案、禁止有色人種入境、尤以對我僑胞入境、限制最爲嚴格、迄一九三九年、前總統羅士尼亞氏任內、宣佈拘捕持有土生證書之華人、先後被拘捕者達五十餘人、遞解出境、並下令將全國凡持有此種土生證書之華人、均加逮捕、撥解出境、因此、我旅巴僑胞、被牽連者至大、後巴政府竟將拘禁之土生華人撥入</p>
<p>長期監禁</p>
<p>事態更加嚴重、使領此時方提交涉、將被拘華人担保釋出、但巴政府聲明仍須於六個月內離境、並須自備船票、但彼等概無護照、船公司不肯售與、而巴政府又不承認彼等爲巴拿罵國籍、不能發給任何證件、致成僵局、至此祇得由我國使領發給彼等以中國護照、此即在事實上正式承認彼等爲中國人、巴當局乃得沿例認彼等非屬巴籍、致變本加厲、所有華僑酒吧餐室及食物店之賣貨員、須由當地政府醫生檢騐身體是吾食格、合格者方給健康證書、准予工作、但往騐白人中、僅三五人合格、其餘均被指爲患病、不得工作、其他又有「七十五」工例、商店極受影響、多自動停業返國、先後共有五批、數近千人、現分居滬港兩地、特組代表團、聯電最高當局促早日與巴國</p>
<p>政府交涉</p>
<p>以維數千僑胞之生計、電曰、「（銜略）迭接巴拿馬僑胞函電及最近被迫歸國僑胞報告、巴國自新總統就任後、排華更烈、將我僑商業恣意摧殘佔奪、或濫予重罰、或拘逮於獄、或撥解出境、種種苛酷、慘難言狀、現該地華僑無法立足、準備離境者數白人、若不設法急救、不特全僑傾家破產、而我國民經濟亦大受影響、查中美各國、唯美國馬首是瞻、際此中美兩國方在同一戰綫、詎巴國竟有此矛盾措施·殊爲詫異、懇速挽美國居間弭止巴國排華、並派幹員赴巴嚴重交涉、以解倒懸、」、</p>

<h3>不要驕傲</h3>
<p>— 王韜</p>
<p>世界上不知有多少人因為驕傲，而葬送了自己的前途。他們因一時的成功，而自傲自大起業，把自己那初步的成功，看作了超出一切的傑作。他看不起別人，他藐視別人的工作，但等到別人再接再厲，不屈不撓的達到眞正成功和勝利的時候，他還是停留在初步成功的階段，因此他失敗了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你不願竟失敗嗎？那就切不要驕傲。我們要虛心學習，謙遜地接受人家的指敎和意見，把自己的成功，一步一步的改進，漸漸地走到最後成功的目的地去。</p>
<p>有許多小朋友因為自己的成績或分數比別人高，就驕傲起來，這是千萬要不得的傾向。譬如在學校裏讀書的小朋友，第一次月考的分數是列在第一，那末他應該更努力，更用功的爭取第二决月考時的原有成績。然而他却並不這樣，他這一次考得了第一，他於是驕傲起來，他看不起別的同學，以爲別人的成績都比他壞，因此他就沒有從前用功了。但是別的同學却比他用功，第二一次月考的時候，顯然的，他一定要遭遇到失敗了。</p>
<p>我們不論做什麼事，首先不應當驕傲，因爲驕傲使你阻礙！</p>
<p>小朋友，你要成功和勝利嗎？那末，請你訊住：不要驕傲！</p>
<h3>三百勇士</h3>
<p>— 志向</p>
<p>正是現在烽火剛熄的希臘，在一千年前這國家在南歐的巴爾幹半島中，居着重要的地位，而且他的民族是那時世界上最文明的一羣。別的民挨還是過着半開化的生活，而希臘和我國一樣建起了巍峨的城市，和詩，童話，寓言等文學作品的出現，爲全世界文藝發芽的地方。</p>
<p>但是還有强烈的愛護國家的精神。</p>
<p>東方的波斯國王羨慕這片士地，他立刻從亞洲向入侵略希臘，他的巨大的軍隊很容易將整個希臘佔據。</p>
<p>然而愛護國家的希臘人民，持戈而起保衛他們的祖國，不爲任何暴君而戰。波期國王却鞭策着人民爲他的利益而侵略。</p>
<p>波斯國王統領他的軍隊，驕傲而又緩慢地從北向南進攻。薩摩潑李是由北向南必經的狹窄的小道，位在兩座高山的中間，祇要他稍爲緩慢一下攻擊，希臘人民就可多一番準備抵抗的機會，甚至於能有充分的力量，打得波斯國王的軍隊一敗塗地。</p>
<p>當時，希臘聯邦之一的斯巴達國王李揚黎特斯，率領一百個勇士去防守這狹窄的小道，這小道只需一人守住，便可抵抗萬夫。不久，波斯國王到了，他藐視這小小數目的三百勇士，以爲立刻就要被他的數萬大軍嚇退。</p>
<p>李揚黎特斯却搶先攻擊波斯國王，所以戰鬬開始了，而波斯國王始終米得勝利。</p>
<p>波斯國王得到奸細的幫助，便包抄李揚黎　期的後路，在黎明時，他和三百個勇士都爲國而犧牲。</p>
<p>他們的熱血不是白費的，不消幾個月，希臘的軍隊超速組成，立刻擊碎波斯國王侵咯的迷夢。</p>
<p>在薩摩潑李的小道中，坐着一隻石獅，上刻「我們是爲祖國戰死在這裏，希望　來的人，不顧艱難保衛我們的祖國」。</p>
<p>所以這次巴爾幹戰爭中，希臘不像捷克斯拉夫般不戰而降。</p>
<h3>學習高爾基</h3>
<p>— 張家駒</p>
<p>今年五月十八日是蘇聯大文豪高爾基氏的逝世五週年的日子。據報紙上載稱：蘇聯當局和人民熱烈的在該天舉行隆重的紀念禮節，來紀念這個巨人。</p>
<p>高爾基爲什麼值得世界上人們—尤其是蘇聯的人民—這樣的崇拜呢？這不僅僅因爲他能够寫文章，在他的筆下所寫出來的文字能够感動人們，使讀他著作的隨着他的筆而喜，怒，哀，樂。更其值得人們重視的是他的堅强不屈的意志和與黑暗勢力不斷搏鬬的精神，以服務於人民爲畢生事業的標的。</p>
<p>高爾基是從小就死了父母的孤兒，他靠他的外祖母撫養，但是他的外祖母也是很貧困的。因此，爲了生活，高爾基很早就跑進社會裏謀生活。他做過麵包司務，船上的水手，畫家的學徒等等職務：這一切以後對於高爾基的寫作是很有幫助的。</p>
<p>學校的生活，高爾基不過過了一二年罷了。他的學問，他的廣博的知識和優美的寫作技巧，都是在職業的餘暇，在僱主惡意的目光下，犧牲睡眠的時間來學習得米的。他用自製的洋鐵罐，棉紗繩做就的燈盞，在微弱的燈光前面，讀借來的書籍。</p>
<p>他曾經想進大學讀書，但沒有成功。他在他所著的「我的大學」裏說：「社會就是他的大學。」那末，各色各樣的人們都是他的敎授了。在這社會的大學裏小斷學習，不斷奮鬬的結果，他終於成爲文學家和革命家，在文學方面的成就，簡直可稱空前了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們在舒適的學校裏安靜的求學，比較他有更好的環境。在紀念高爾基以後，我們應該效法他的學習精神，努力吸取知能，多難的國家正需要我們這一批人來建設呢！</p>

<p>豌豆做蜈蚣</p>
<p>豌豆是最好吃的豆類；但是當它做成了蜈蚣以後，那才可怕啦！</p>
<p>要將豌豆做成蜈蚣，必須要準備針和綫，此外還要許多的小竹籤。</p>
<p>將二十個豌豆和綫連成一條，揀大的豌一豆排在前節，以下漸漸地小下去。我們也可以用竹籤相連豌豆，但是做出的蜈蚣是小活潑的。</p>
<p>我們知道蜈蚣是有許多脚的，我們的小竹籤便是拿夾做脚用的。</p>
<p>蜈蚣的頭上有兩根毒鬚，所以我們還要用兩根極細的竹籤挿在頭部，又因爲蜈蚣的頭是紅色的，所以我們必須將第一粒豌豆染成紅色。</p>
<p>蜈蚣尾部有一對分叉的尾，我們必須用兩根粗短的竹籤挿在最後一粒豌豆上。</p>
<p>當你做好了蜈蚣以後，不要把小弟弟嚇哭呵！</p>
<p>茄子做猪</p>
<p>茄了你是知道的，最近不是有茄子上市嗎？猪你更是知道的，你也許還常常駡別的小孩做「猪」呢！</p>
<p>不用說，茄子就像猪的身材，不過是少了腿和尾罷了，最奇怪的是；茄子柄很粗，可以做猪的嘴；茄子的柄上有四五瓣葉形的東西，恰像猪的耳朶。</p>
<p>這樣，我們便可開始做「豬」了。</p>
<p>先將茄柄上四五瓣葉形的東西，留下一對大小相同，很像猪耳朶的，再將茄柄割去一段，使它成爲猪的嘴形。</p>
<p>四脚可用塗黑的竹棍或木棍去做，尾巴可用軟一點的東西去做，然後將它們挿在茄子適當的位置。</p>
<p>猪做成以後，你不要再駡旁的孩子做「猪」了。</p>
<h3>熱天常見的事</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>在日常生活中，愈是常見的事，愈是容易疏忽，要是能够時時加以思慮的話，定會產生不少有趣的問題　，然而越是有趣的問題，越是不容易　出一個答案。就是在熱大，講到在然天時常看見的幾件事，我們總很易容地把它們忽略過的，而阿亮的爸爸却不時的把這種阿亮自以爲很膚淺的問題來問着他，可是花他簡單而幼稚的腦海中，自然不能獲得一些綫索，所以問便把他問倒了。</p>
<p>當在一個禮拜天的下午，天氣眞熱，連把阿亮走出門去玩的興致也打消了，但他爸爸忽然竟這樣的問着他：「在夏天多出汗，究竟有什麼好處：毛巾爲什麼能措乾額上的汗；」阿亮一面聽着，一面眼見得他爸爸額上的確有不少的汗在淌着，當他在發問時，更把一塊毛巾揩去淌着的汗珠，阿亮才知道他爸爸所以能想出這兩個問題的動機來。</p>
<p>「在夏天多出汗，這當然是天熱的綠故，如果天氣不熱，汗便不會出了。毛巾天然是能揩乾汗的，所以我要用它呀！」阿亮還自以為這問題再幼稚也沒有了，虧他爸爸能想得出的。</p>
<p>「哈哈！你這新的回答，還是不回答來得好，假使直截回雨不知道，倒可顯出你的老實。你知道你所回答的是一知半解，所以今天我提出來問問你，這樣可以引起你的注意。現在我來解釋給你聽：夏天的氣候很熱，往往比了我們身體的溫度來要把人熱死了。但是我們一到了夏天，便要出汗，所以出汗是在熱天很緊要的事，要是不出汗那一定要生病了，因爲出汗可以使得身體感覺凉爽，這話怎麼說起的呢？在出汗之後，並不老是停留在身體上，故不到一會兒，汗液便要蒸發，而變成氣體，但在蒸　時，必須吸收熱，它便奪取在身體叫周熱空氣中的熱，吾則蒸發作用變慢，把空氣中的熱吸去時，察氣的溫度降低，這時混身覺得異常的舒適和凉快了。毛巾所以能揩汗，因爲毛巾的質地是由織維構成的，當織維織造成毛巾，組織得疏鬆，便形成了不少的微隙，可惜我們肉眼不能瞧個明白，而這種種微有有吸收水份的能力，所以它能把汗揩乾，也就是把汗吸收到毛巾的微隙中去。講到這裹，又想起了關於熱天的各種問題：在夏天我們多穿白角衣服，更必須燙得很平，穿上身上，便覺得格外的美觀。可是漿過的衣服燙了之後，爲什麼就變硬的呢？漿衣服普遍是用菱粉的，菱粉是富有澱粉質，所以燙的時候，經過了高的熱度，澱粉便擊成固體而硬的糊精，所以衣服也隨着變成硬的了。寄信的郵票反面也是糊精來黏貼在信封上。我們在夏天多晒日光，皮膚便會變黑，這是什麼道理？因爲皮膚裏有一種細胞，能够產生黑色素，如經過特別炎熱的日光晒過以後，便促進道種黑色素的產生，所以多晒太陽，黑色素的產生也加快，因此一過一個夏天，便可變成個黑炭了。……阿亮的爸爸講到這裏時阿亮媽媽叫他去洗浴的一陣喊聲，把那　頭打斷；阿亮從此不敢再也自作聰明了。</p>

<h3>談談金鎖記</h3>
<p>— 谷梅</p>
<p>「金鎖記」即「六月雪」也。此劇爲靑衣正工戲，胡喜祿，時小福，陳德霖，吳彩霞，皆以此劇稱佳奏。後之四大名旦，莫不演之，程硯秋且以此劇聞名焉。</p>
<p>此劇爲元人關漢卿所撰，劇目爲「竇娥寃」略云楚州竇天章有女端雲，幼予蔡婆爲養媳，改名竇娥，婚後二年，蔡子病故，娥守節奉姑，有江湖醫士名賽盧醫者，負婆金，蔡婆往索，盧醫因乏資以償，乃引婆於郊，以繩勒婆頸，擬死之，遇張驢兒父子，救之歸，婆德之，留驢兒父千於家，張老欲妻蔡婆，驢兒想娶竇娥，蔡將委曲從之，竇娥抗節，詬駡驢兒，會蔡婆病，竇娥至玉龍庵祈神，拜禱時將其夫所遺之金鎖墜地，爲張驢兒拾去，竇娥歸，蔡婆索羊肚湯，張驢兒以謀死蔡婆，則竇娥孤弱可欺矣，乃向竇娥曰我當代辦之，至盧醫處與謀，評竇娥曾以金鎖易毒藥去，否則將以勒死蔡罪見官，盧醫被制允其請，予毒藥以去，驢兒乃下藥於羊肚湯中，竇娥進湯，婆以味腥難聞，不食，適張老自外歸，飢甚，取食之，流血而死。驢兒逼竇娥妻之，寶不從，驢兒嗚於官，吏不察，竟抵娥罪，行刑時血逆流似白練，六月飛霜，死後楚州大早三年，會竇天章爲兩淮提刑廉訪使，娥魂訴寃，覆讞前案，具得實情，置驢兒於極刑，並定盧醫之罪。淸無名氏將其事重編一劇，定名「金鎖記」，言蔡婆子昌宗，赴考時舟覆，入龍宮，海龍王以三女小娥妻之，後與竇娥重圓，並改竇娥將臨刑，六月飛雪，會兩淮提刑廉訪使竇天章至楚州，知有寃獄，將竇娥緩刑，覆審前案。時蔡昌宗亦歸楚尋母，翁婿母子夫婦得重逢，惟驢兒非　刑，乃越獄後爲雷所擊。</p>
<p>今平劇所演與上二本略有不同，改張驢兒之父爲張母，驢兒欲竇娥，婆媳皆不允，而蔡婆有委曲從之之黛驢兒鳴官乃告蔡婆謀害，使蔡婆入獄，驢兒又强逼竇氏成婚，與前本又有出入，竇氏乃代婆認罪，非吏讞胡斷者，惟如平本所演，「金鎖記」劇目實無出處，但程硯秋黃桂秋每演此戲，反多貼「金鎖記」，而不常寫「六月雪」或「竇娥寃」，蓋習慣使然也。</p>

<p>第十一章　英姿颯爽來酣戰</p>
<p>柳隱英見許靖拆開書信閱讀時，他也走上前並肩而看。這封書是周遇吉將軍親筆寫的，寥寥數語，所以一目了然。許靖便回頭對柳隱英說道：「旣然寇警已急，將軍要我們前去相助守土，這是義不容辭的事。况我此來本是從戎立功的，寇臨城下，正志士効命之秋，不知賢弟如何？」柳隱英道：「當然我們要追隨周將軍努力殺賊，方不負爲大明臣民。現在靖哥不妨先入城去，待小弟和姑母商量後，得其允許，必當追踪而來。寄語周將軍，說我柳某並非懦夫，一定要來麾下効力的。只是山上尚有些私事要處置妥當後，方能再來。」許靖聽柳隱英如此說，因爲柳隱英尚沒有受職，不須應卯，又相信他的說話是實，所以他就收拾包裹，佩上赤鳳寶劍，辭別了柳隱英的姑母，和差官出門去。差官把坐騎讓給許靖坐。柳隱英送上十幾步，立在一株大樹下，眼瞧着許靖跳上坐騎，說一聲「願靖哥努力，早奏凱歌，小弟如能早來，當相隨驥尾。」許靖也回頭說一聲「希望賢弟早來代州共同殺賊。」加上一鞭，坐下馬早已展　四蹄，潑刺刺地向山下跑去了。許靖一路縱轡疾馳，一路心中自思，柳隱英武藝甚好，此時正好戮力王室，爲什麼遲遲其行呢？看他似乎別有隱衷，一時未必能够出山。倘然他始終不肯賦同仇之詩，揮戈逐寇，那豈非空負此七尺之軀嗎？何以必要和他的姑母商量呢？我雖和他義結金蘭，而他的家世來歷毫無所知。他始終沒有告訴我，這眞是奇怪的事情呢。許靖一路跑一路想，鸞聲噦噦，不多時已到代州城下。（九〇）</p>

<h3>America Will Provide 1 Billion Yuan in Military Supplies to China to Continue Fighting; Morgenthau Praises Economic Aid Policy Toward China and Urges Expansion of Presidential Power to Devalue the Dollar</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 14th – According to a report in the Daily Mirror here, in order to enable the Chinese government to continue its war against Japan, the United States intends to provide China with military supplies worth one billion US dollars. A China Defense Supply Association has been organized to handle this matter. The association has five members, and Wei Ziven, chairman of the Bank of China, is one of the members.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the Senate Banking and Currency Committee yesterday that "the measures taken by the Stabilization Fund toward China have been of great help to China and its currency system, and are sufficient to assist its economic war against the occupied areas." In a letter to the committee, he urged the expansion of presidential power to execute the 2 billion US dollar Stabilization Fund and to devalue the US dollar. He also reviewed the measures previously announced by the Treasury Department toward China, stating that "According to the Sino-US agreement of July 14, 1937, the Treasury Secretary once had 48 million US dollars worth of Chinese currency at a certain time. Later, this number was reduced to 19 million US dollars, with a guarantee of pure gold."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th – Senator Smathers of New Jersey telegraphed the New York Herald Tribune yesterday, saying, "It is learned that oil shipments to Japan are about to cease, and the United States will no longer face the risk of having Sundays without gasoline." The newspaper had previously published a report stating that the US government was considering cutting off oil shipments to Japan because the United States itself was experiencing shortages. The report also stated that in the past, US oil exports to Japan amounted to as much as 800,000 barrels per month. People recall that Interior Secretary Ickes recently stated that because national defense now requires a large amount of gasoline, the eastern coastal provinces of the United States are experiencing "gasoline-free Sundays."</p>
<h3>US Government Considering Cutting Off Oil Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington, 13th – The Herald Tribune published an exclusive report today, stating that, according to government sources, the US government is now considering the pros and cons of cutting off US oil shipments to Japan. After the newspaper published a report yesterday stating that US oil shipments to Japan amounted to more than 800,000 barrels per month, Senator Smathers of New Jersey telegraphed the newspaper, saying, "As far as I know, this transportation to Japan will be stopped." Since the eastern states have been restricting the use of gasoline due to a lack of transportation, the issue of oil supply has become the most important domestic problem, and this matter affects national defense and hinders the use of cars by millions of private and institutional car owners. Therefore, there is a strong demand in public opinion and newspapers to stop all oil shipments to Japan. In the past week, isolationists have maintained a strange silence on this matter, while supporters of the government have demanded a ban on oil exports to Japan. It is also rumored that a large amount of oil has recently been transshipped from Japan to Germany.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – The Aid China Committee recently decided to organize a delegation of prominent British political figures to visit British Foreign Secretary Eden, US Ambassador to Britain Winant, and the Dutch government to urge the British, American, and Dutch governments to impose a total oil embargo on Japan. Now that Winant has returned to the United States, this plan has been temporarily postponed until his return to office, but the idea has not been abandoned. News from Chongqing indicates that people here are paying close attention to the appeal by eleven important Chinese groups to President Roosevelt to implement an oil embargo on Japan.</p>
<h3>Japan Continues to Extract American Goods from Haiphong; Most are Shipped to Hainan Island</h3>
<p>United Press, Hanoi, 14th – Japanese troops have taken 566 barrels of lubricating oil from the Haiphong warehouse of the American merchant Mack Jewel Oil Company. The Japanese military's extraction of Sino-American goods from Haiphong continues unabated. French protests have been ineffective. It is estimated that more than 25,000 tons have been taken, most of which have been shipped to Hainan Island. The Japanese side claims that the goods are war supplies belonging to China and are being transported to Chongqing. The American merchants claim that they are American property.</p>
<h3>US President to Order Bombing of German Submarines; Germany Reiterates Determination to Sink Any Ships Carrying Military Supplies to Britain</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 14th – Since the German side has disregarded the incident of torpedoing the American cargo ship Robin Moor, Washington officials believe that President Roosevelt will order the US Navy's Atlantic patrol to bomb any German submarines they encounter.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 14th – German officials reiterated yesterday that Germany will sink any ships carrying contraband to Britain, regardless of their nationality. Many ships have already been sunk. The Robin Moor was not the only ship sunk while en route to Britain. Whether its name is Robin Moor or Exmoor, if it is carrying contraband to Britain, we will sink it. The cargo on the ship is considered contraband by Britain, and of course, Germany can also consider it contraband. German officials believe that the ship's voyage to Cape Town in South Africa was actually headed for a British port. US officials have stated that the ship was not carrying contraband.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Advocates Severing Relations with Germany</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th – New York State Democratic Congressman Siller sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, proposing to sever diplomatic relations with Germany to prevent conspiracies and sabotage.</p>
<h3>Netherlands East Indies Council to Meet Tomorrow; Discussion of Improving Commercial Relations with China</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – According to well-informed Dutch sources in Batavia, the next session of the Batavia Council will begin on the 16th. The meeting will discuss the issue of improving commercial relations between the Netherlands East Indies and China.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hints that Japan Will Not Attack the Netherlands East Indies; Instructions to Yoshizawa Issued by Japanese Government Yesterday; Contents to be Announced in Tokyo Today</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that regarding the tense situation between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies, Japan will soon announce its policy on the matter. The European Axis powers have their own problems, and Japan, an ally, also has its Far East problems. We will do our best to ensure that various problems do not arise. Japan will also resolve its problems in a spirit of peace and order.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th – The Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau announced today that the Japanese government's instructions to Yoshizawa were issued this afternoon. The content is Japan's policy regarding the Netherlands East Indies' response to Japan's final conditions. These instructions were passed at a joint meeting of the Cabinet and senior commanders on June 11, but were not issued until the final study of the Japanese reply. The content of the instructions will be announced by the Cabinet Information Bureau tomorrow.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 14th – The Asahi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese government has decided to recall Yoshizawa from Batavia and has decided on its future policy. However, the government is carefully considering when to issue a statement of its beliefs regarding the Japanese-Dutch negotiations. At the same time, Chugai Shimbun announced that the government does not need to rush to issue a declaration, because the government has already decided on its policy and can implement it at any time. Therefore, Japan can temporarily act arbitrarily depending on the actions of the Netherlands East Indies.</p>
<h3>US Confiscates Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th – According to a report in the Jiji Shimbun here, Japanese mail, including newspapers and periodicals, has been confiscated or burned by the authorities in San Francisco. US authorities claim that what was destroyed were propaganda materials. The newspaper is quite indignant that the US authorities have labeled the newspapers as propaganda. It is said that Tokyo newspapers from April 20 have not yet reached their recipients.</p>
<h3>US to Protest to Germany over the Robin Moor Case; Demands Apology and Compensation; Welles Condemns Germany's Disregard for the Lives of Crew Members; 26 US Ships Have Already Loaded Cargo and Sailed to the Red Sea</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th – It is learned that the US government's attitude towards the sinking of the Robin Moor by a Nazi submarine will be based on Germany's failure to take precautions to protect the lives of passengers. Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States, standing on the basis of international law, condemns Germany for disregarding the lives of crew members and failing to provide rescue. Welles stated that he did not believe that the German side had ordered the taking of measures to protect lives when it sank the Robin Moor in the South Atlantic. Welles also stated that international law has clear provisions on this point, and both the United States and Germany accepted the same obligations in the London Treaty. He pointed out that the United States has never accepted the British and German regulations prohibiting neutral ships from carrying contraband. According to Welles, this was clearly aimed at Germany's claim that the ship was carrying contraband. Welles also stated that the State Department had obtained various facts from the rescued crew members, and there was no doubt about the issue of rescuing distressed passengers under international law. According to well-informed sources, the US government will soon lodge a protest with Germany, demanding compensation and an apology, without causing a war.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 13th – Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that there was no doubt about the facts of the sinking of the American ship Robin Moor. He would speak again after the authorities received a detailed report from the rescued persons and completed the investigation. The US government has never recognized the definition of contraband published by any party in the current war. What the United States insists on is that Germany and the United States are both signatories to the 1930 International Agreement. According to this agreement, submarines must first take appropriate and cautious measures to ensure the safety of crew members and passengers before sinking a ship. As for the Robin Moor case, the facts are there and do not need to be explained. The Robin Line Company firmly stated to reporters that the Robin Moor was not carrying ammunition or military supplies. The company allowed reporters to inspect the ship's manifest, and the results showed that the only military equipment on board was a box of .22 caliber rifles, without ammunition, and ten boxes of shotgun shells, which were being shipped to a sporting goods store in Johannesburg, South Africa. An employee of the shipping company said that there were also some chemicals on board, the use of which is currently unknown.</p>
<p>TASS, New York, 13th – The New York Times reported that the US Maritime Commission announced that 26 US ships have loaded various raw materials and are heading to various Red Sea ports. The White House stated that President Roosevelt's representative is on his way to oversee the transportation of American military supplies.</p>
<h3>37 Crew Members Adrift for 19 Days</h3>
<p>United Press, Pernambuco, Brazil, 14th – The Second Officer of the American ship Robin Moor, which was sunk by a German submarine, told a United Press reporter that the German submarine personnel deliberately prohibited the ship from sending out a wireless distress signal, otherwise all personnel on board could have been rescued. The Robin Moor was intercepted by a German submarine in the early morning of May 21, and armed sailors were immediately sent on board to guard the wireless room to prevent us from sending out a distress signal. It was then bombarded with artillery fire within 23 minutes, without using torpedoes. We divided into three lifeboats, a total of 37 people, including one child. The three boats drifted together at sea for eight days, but in order to increase our chances of being rescued, we separated. The boat I was on rowed day and night for 19 days continuously. We had biscuits to stave off hunger, and we were fortunate to find a way to collect rainwater to sustain life. Everyone looked for land every day, and it was not until 11:30 p.m. on the 19th day that we encountered the Brazilian ship Osorio. We used a flashlight to signal, and fortunately we were seen by the ship, which immediately rescued us on board. We were all exhausted and unable to stand, and we were lifted onto the ship one by one. If we had not been rescued, we could have lived for another ten days.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From the Issues of Oil and Food to German-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Since the armistice in France last June, only two paths have been open to Hitler: one is to use blitzkrieg tactics to quickly defeat Britain; the other is to gradually control the entire European continent and establish a so-called "New European Order" in order to be in a position to cope with a long-term war politically and economically. Perhaps due to practical difficulties, he finally embarked on the second path. After spending nearly a year, he has finally conquered the entire southeastern Europe, but the "New Order" in his mind is still far from being realized.</p>
<p>The so-called "New European Order," politically speaking, requires that all participating countries be under the absolute control of Germany. Economically speaking, it must at least be self-sufficient in terms of resources. In reality, although most European countries are under Axis control, their economies are still unable to be "independent," especially the supply and demand of oil and food, which still cannot be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>According to experts, the oil consumption of Germany and Italy and the countries they control, including military and civilian use, must be at least 20 million tons per year. As for the supply side, in addition to the 4 million tons of oil and synthetic oil that Germany can produce, and the 6 million tons that Romania can produce, the shortfall must be at least about 10 million tons. Although the Soviet Union ranks first among the world's oil-producing countries, in fact, the amount of oil it could export was only 600,000 tons in 1939. It may have been more last year, but it will definitely not be more than 2 million tons. The reason why Germany has not felt an oil shortage in the past year is partly because it still has 4.5 million tons of stockpiles domestically, and partly because it has plundered a lot of oil from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. Although it may be possible to reduce the civilian oil supply in various places to the minimum limit in the future, given Germany's extensive use of air force and mechanized troops in combat, its annual military oil consumption is at least 10 million tons, and Italy needs at least 2.5 million tons. Therefore, regardless of whether long-term combat is needed in the future, without new replenishment, it will inevitably repeat the same mistakes as in the last European war, when it had to abandon the war and beg for peace due to the exhaustion of oil resources. The best target for Germany to obtain oil supply is of course Iran and Iraq in the Middle East, because the former produces 11 million tons of oil and the latter produces 4.3 million tons, which is more than enough to meet the needs of the Axis powers. However, the recent consolidation of the chaos in Iraq and the early lead of Britain in Syria have proved that Hitler's plan to seize Middle Eastern oil fields is still not easy to realize. Therefore, the most convenient and effective way is to try to coerce the Soviet Union to allocate more of its annual production of 28 million tons of oil to Germany.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of food, before the war, Western European countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal all relied on overseas supply. Since the British Navy implemented the blockade, almost all overseas food sources have been cut off. As for the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, although they usually have surplus grain for export, according to experts, since the outbreak of the war, due to the enlistment of strong men, the abandonment of farming, and the destruction of rural areas, etc., this year's output will be reduced by 40% compared to before the war. If so, then the amount of surplus grain that they can supply to Western Europe will also be far less than before the war. The fact that the defeated countries of Western Europe, and even Germany and Italy themselves, have successively implemented bread consumption quotas shows that the crisis of food shortages in Europe has not been completely resolved. On the one hand, the Axis powers are unable to obtain food from overseas due to the British blockade, and on the other hand, they are suffering from the fact that the competition for Africa and the Near East cannot alleviate the problem in time. Under this situation, of course, they cannot help but turn their attention to the Soviet Union, this vast agricultural country.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that British Prime Minister Churchill's previous loud cry that Germany would soon covet the granary of Ukraine and the oil fields of the Caucasus, although inevitably premature, is by no means alarmist. Let us assume for Germany: since it is currently unable to quickly conquer the British Isles, it cannot help but seek a way to "use war to support war" in the future in order to cope with the unlimited needs of long-term combat. Hitler's expansion in continental Europe has reached a saturation point, but he is still unable to be self-sufficient in terms of resources. Since it is so difficult for him to succeed in the Near East and Northeast Africa, and his need to replenish supplies, especially to replenish oil, is so urgent, under the demand to quickly establish a so-called "New Order," "the friendly Soviet Union" has of course become his "most convenient target." It is a fact that Germany is rumored to have concentrated troops on the Soviet border (TASS said it was a troop movement). Although it is not敢 say that Hitler is already prepared to attack the Soviet Union, at least it can be inferred that he is using the old trick of "stationing troops on the border" to coerce Moscow into further "cooperation" in all aspects, especially in the economic sphere, in order to relieve his "imminent crisis." If the Soviet Union insists on refusing to concede, he may turn hostile immediately! Under this situation, we cannot help but worry about Stalin, who took over the government after Molotov, because we have long felt that the Soviet Union's past policy of compromise with Germany has not only failed to drive away the threat of aggression, but has instead brought it closer and closer. In fact, this situation of "compromise and cooperation" may have already reached its "end point." If further compromises are made in the future, it will be tantamount to becoming a German vassal. If it insists on not compromising, it will inevitably be caught up in the war. If we say that August 1939 was the starting point of German-Soviet friendship, then June 1941 is at least a major turning point in German-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3>Several Japanese Planes Attacked Sichuan Yesterday in Three Waves; Many Bombs Dropped on Commercial Areas of Chongqing; Damage to Chinese Houses and Property Not Severe</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Today, Japanese planes attacked Sichuan Province in three waves. A certain area near the West Gate of Chongqing was heavily attacked. The alarm was issued at 12:30 p.m. After the first batch of Japanese planes entered Sichuan Province, they flew to Guangyuan in the northwest. Nearly an hour and a half later, Chongqing issued an emergency alarm because the second batch of Japanese planes had flown along the Jialing River through Hechuan towards Chongqing, and the planes crossed the small hill where the Soviet Embassy was located from the Yangtze River side and bombed the area near the West Gate, where the British Embassy was located. The third batch of Japanese planes flew over Fuling downstream of Chongqing, but did not appear in the city. The alarm was lifted at 4:00 p.m. According to detailed reports of today's air raid, Japanese planes dropped bombs in a vast area of the lower city today, rather than concentrating bombing on a specific area. Several bombs fell near the West Gate of Chongqing, and many bombs fell in the commercial area of the lower city, and also near the riverbank further east. Fortunately, no houses caught fire, and the property damage was also quite limited. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – At 2:30 p.m. today, 27 Japanese bombers flew over Chongqing and bombed the urban area and the slum residential areas along the Jialing River. There were some casualties. Chongqing was under alarm for three and a half hours, and the alarm was not lifted until 4:00 p.m. The western suburbs were heavily bombed, because a large amount of dust and smoke was seen rising in that area.

<h3>Wartime Excess Profits Tax Already Collected in Yunnan</h3>
<p>Kunming – (1) Direct taxes are the main source of wartime revenue. Since the Ministry of Finance has only recently started collecting direct taxes, all parties are not very clear about this. It is decided that July 1 will be Direct Tax Day, and propaganda will be expanded simultaneously throughout the country. The Yunnan Direct Tax Bureau is actively preparing. (2) The wartime excess profits tax in Yunnan Province has already been collected this year. Many stores here have voluntarily reported and paid the tax. The amount verified by the Yunnan Direct Tax Bureau has reached more than one million yuan, and most have automatically paid to the national treasury. (13th)</p>

<h3>Distinguished Elders of Guangfeng Donate a Large Sum</h3>
<p>Taihe (1) Xu Hao and Ji Taohua, distinguished elders of Guangfeng, whose family fortune was abundant as former scholars of the Qing Dynasty, actively participated in the war of resistance. Therefore, in any fundraising campaign in the county, they generously donated. Now, with the victory approaching, Xu and Ji specially donated all their property (excluding living expenses), totaling 1.3 million yuan, to the government a few days ago, breaking the record of previous donations in the province. It is said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek highly praised this act and personally wrote the inscription "(Destroying one's home to relieve the national crisis)", which was presented to Xu and Ji. He also telegraphed the county magistrate to express his gratitude on behalf of the government. (2) Hong Gongchen, a prominent figure in Xiushui, is known for his kindness and generosity and is highly respected by the villagers. Recently, seeing the suffering of righteous people in various places and with the collapse of the Japanese army imminent, he auctioned off all his family property, raising more than 300,000 yuan, which was entirely remitted to the China Relief Society to help righteous people in various places. He also personally sent his only son, Hong Yuan, to the county government to enlist in the army. The county magistrate, considering Hong's act of destroying his home to relieve the national crisis as truly commendable, specially telegraphed the central government to commend him.

<h3>The Huai River Embankment Has Been Destroyed</h3>
<p>Chongqing According to news received here, the locks and embankments of the Huai River and the Grand Canal, which cost a total of 24.5 million yuan to build, a portion of which was borrowed from the British refund of the Boxer Indemnity, are reportedly destroyed by the Japanese in northern Jiangsu. The destroyed projects include the locks in Shaobo and three other locations, as well as a section of the Zhongshan Canal connecting the Huai River to the sea, and five unfinished embankments and locks. According to Chinese reports, the Japanese have removed the steel gates, machinery, and other metal components. (Reuter's dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<h3>Tension Between Germany and the Soviet Union Denied Solemnly by the Soviet Union Both Sides Can Abide by the Non-Aggression Pact Germany Has Not Made Any Demands on the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 14th Before the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, returned to London, and especially after his arrival, British and other foreign newspapers have been vigorously spreading rumors of an imminent "war between the Soviet Union and Germany." These rumors can be divided into three categories: (1) Germany has made territorial and economic demands on the Soviet Union, and the two sides are currently negotiating to conclude a new, closer agreement; (2) the Soviet Union has rejected these demands, so Germany has begun to concentrate a large number of troops on the Soviet border, preparing to attack the Soviet Union; (3) the Soviet Union is urgently preparing for war and has deployed troops to the German border. These rumors are indeed absurd, but responsible parties in Moscow believe it is necessary to clarify. Therefore, they have authorized TASS to solemnly declare that these rumors are purely foolish and planned declarations by those who hate the Soviet Union and Germany and seek to expand the war.</p>
<p>TASS declared: (1) Germany has neither made demands on the Soviet Union nor intended to conclude a new, closer agreement. Therefore, the two sides have never held negotiations on this matter. (2) According to information obtained by the Soviet Union, Germany, like the Soviet Union, faithfully abides by the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Therefore, the Soviet side believes that rumors of Germany breaking the pact and attacking the Soviet Union are unfounded. As for the transfer of German troops from the Balkans to eastern and northeastern Germany, it is presumed to have other motives unrelated to Soviet-German relations. (3) In pursuit of its peaceful policy, the Soviet Union will, as always, adhere to the provisions of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. From this perspective, the so-called Soviet preparations for war with Germany are a fabrication and a provocative rumor. (4) The summer exercises currently and recently conducted by the Red Army are purely for the purpose of training reservists and inspecting railway operations. This is a regular annual activity. Rumors that these activities of the Red Army are aimed at Germany are utterly absurd.</p>
<h3>German Troop Movements to the East Are Indeed a Fact</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Ankara, 14th Passengers arriving here today stated that Romania and Hungary are discussing the possibility of a future German invasion of the Soviet Union. It is rumored that Germany currently has a total of 120 divisions stationed on the Soviet border, of which 20 or 30 divisions are in Moldavia. It is reported that a large number of German cavalry are concentrated in that area. Six German submarines in Graz have been completed, and many pontoon bridges have been transported to unknown locations. Romania is currently undergoing general mobilization. Bucharest and Constanta are taking precautions against air raids. Foreign travelers in Romania are now forced to travel by plane to avoid seeing the troop movements. Romanians generally believe that an attack on the Soviet Union to recover Bessarabia is imminent. Romanians in Istanbul now guess that the ratio of those who believe Germany will attack the Soviet Union within a month is five to one. Well-informed sources believe that there are two reasons for these rumors: (1) to pressure the Soviet Union to make concessions; (2) to reduce Romanian resentment of the German occupation. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the above threats. It is reported that the number of troops currently stationed in the western border area is 140 to 155 divisions, including the 55 divisions in Ukraine and Bessarabia.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Evacuates Border Residents</h3>
<p>United Press, Vatican City, 17th Yesterday, the "Osservatore Romano" published a report from Stockholm stating that the Soviet Union has evacuated residents from Ukraine and the Soviet-occupied Polish territories. At the same time, industrial factories in Latvia are also being evacuated. It also stated that the construction of the Stalin Line is being accelerated, as the Red Army intends to conduct large-scale exercises there.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in Bucharest Authorities Issue Notices to Residents on How to Deal with Air Raids</h3>

Skramm was wounded twice during World War I. In the current war, he served as a paratrooper in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Skramm was also the police chief of Teutemann.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Australian Minister to China Next Week</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Sydney, 14th After the Federal Parliament convenes next week, the name of the new Australian Minister to China will be announced.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the U.S. Department of Commerce</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th Secretary of Commerce Jones has reorganized the International and Domestic Commerce Bureaus to expand U.S. commerce with other countries in the Americas and to adapt to the rapidly evolving global commercial situation. The bureau is one of the main agencies managing U.S. domestic and foreign trade. It has now been divided into five main parts, four of which handle various aspects of research, publication, and statistics. The fifth part is the International Economics Division, which specializes in the affairs of the world's major commercial areas, such as the British Empire, Europe, the Far East, and South America. The division's South American affairs have become increasingly important since the outbreak of the European war, and it is expected that more attention will be paid to this work in the future. Edward, who has experience in South American business and economic affairs, has been appointed as the head of the International Economics Division.</p>
<h3>Important Developments in German-Finnish Relations German Troops Arrive at Finnish Border Berlin Does Not Deny</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th A dispatch from Helsinki reports that Germany has made far-reaching demands on the Soviet Union. News from Helsinki also reports that important developments are expected in German-Finnish relations. According to news from Ankara, it is anticipated that Germany will continue to make economic demands on the Soviet Union, backed by the deployment of troops on the border.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 14th In response to reports from Britain that 55,000 German troops have arrived in Finland to resist the Soviet Union, German authorities here stated last night that the arrival of German troops in Finland is well known, but nothing else is known. However, even if we were aware of any other circumstances, we would not be able to comment, as this is a military matter.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Penetrate Deep into Syria French Troops Still Resisting Fiercely Anglo-Syrian Authorities Conduct Negotiations Fate of the Ancient City of Damascus Hangs in the Balance</h3>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 14th French troops are resisting strongly and have driven out Allied forces that occupied Saida (a key town 20 miles south of the Port of Beirut), but Australian armored columns have again penetrated the outskirts of Saida for the second time in a wedge-like formation. Saida was in French hands yesterday afternoon, but was continuously shelled by British forces. In addition, Allied mechanized units attempted to break through Kiswe, ten miles from Damascus, but were repelled by the French defenders. British forces concentrated on the southern front reorganized their forces along the entire line and launched a fierce offensive. In the coastal area, Australian troops, assisted by the strengthened British Navy, advanced several miles into the suburbs of Saida. It is also reported that Allied forces attacked Muye Yangtu and entered the Beqaa Valley, from where they could attack the Rayak airfield. However, all British forces on this route were repelled by the French defenders, with only some Canadian troops making slight progress.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Cairo, 14th Today, a headquarters communique, referring to the situation in Damascus, stated that Free French forces had apparently abandoned their attempt to seize the Kiswe position and were seeking to encircle the French resistance to the east.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th According to an official announcement, Vichy troops in Syria have withdrawn from Kiswe, ten miles from Damascus. United Press, London, 14th The fate of the ancient city of Damascus appears to hinge on the outcome of talks between representatives of French officials stationed in Syria, led by General Dentz, and Lieutenant General Wilson, commander of British forces in Egypt. British military and aviation experts here today are speculating about the possibility of German air fleets beginning operations. They anticipate that British and German air forces may clash over the Syrian coast, which could be a prelude to a German bombing campaign against British forces operating in Syria. British sources from the Near East generally expect the French to continue fighting to defend this ancient Islamic city, but some believe that the city will be declared an open city or may even surrender. It is reported that General Wilson has surrounded Damascus with three divisions of his forces, apparently to show Vichy that the situation is hopeless, so that the French can surrender the city and avoid bloodshed.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Occurs off the Syrian Coast</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Cairo, 14th A special communique from the British Air Force Command in the Middle East stated that yesterday, the Australian Air Force won a fierce battle with Axis aircraft off the Syrian coast, shooting down three Junkers aircraft and destroying several others. One of them had its wings on fire and fled in panic. A total of eight or nine enemy aircraft attempted to attack a British warship three miles west of Saida, but were intercepted by fighter planes. Except for four enemy aircraft that dive-bombed, the rest abandoned their bombs and fled in haste, but three were eventually shot down and several others were heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of Free French Forces Discusses the Situation in Syria</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th General Petit, Chief of Staff of General de Gaulle, met with reporters in London yesterday. He estimated that British, Allied, and Free French forces in Syria are currently facing resistance from 45,000 Vichy troops, including 30,000 soldiers. Their commander, General Verdy Lecocq, was captured by the Germans and then released along with other generals, promising not to actively participate in anti-German operations. Petit emphatically stated that the Allied entry into Syria is an action against the Germans, saying that "we are only fighting the Germans and will continue to fight them wherever and whenever possible until the final victory is achieved. We do not want to achieve a major military victory in Syria. Free French forces in Syria are ordered not to fire first. Many French soldiers in Syria who hold the tricolor flag in one hand and a white flag in the other to join us have been shot in the back by soldiers acting on Verdy Lecocq's orders. The arrival of British and Free French forces in Syria will have a huge impact on the people of France and French North Africa. The result can be seen in Darlan's recent speech, as Darlan has admitted that he is quite worried and aware that he cannot carry out his original plan for a joint Franco-German attack on Britain. It is now expected that General Weygand (Vichy's representative in Northwest Africa) will not take any action beyond the terms of the armistice. Darlan also knows that he cannot rely on the assistance of the French fleet, as 60% of the French sailors are from Brittany and their hatred of Germany is deeply rooted. If Darlan ordered the French fleet to attack Britain, many French ships would defect to Britain. Darlan ordered the French battleship "Richelieu" to sail from Dakar back to Brest, but the crew refused, so the ship remained in Dakar."</p>
<h3>Hull Sternly Condemns Vichy Government's Appeasement of Germany Acknowledges That British Entry into Syria Was Justified U.S.-French Relations Deteriorate</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 14th Secretary of State Hull formally issued a statement yesterday strongly condemning the French Darlan-Laval faction, saying that the Vichy government is clearly fighting for Germany in Syria and that he feels the British entry into Syria was indeed justified, as this is the only way to prevent the expansion of German aggression. Hull continued, "When Hitler decided to use Syria to attack British forces in Iraq, Vichy did not object to this violation of the armistice agreement, nor did it resist. Syria is the most important part of Hitler's plan to invade Iraq, Egypt, the Suez Canal region, and Africa. The statements made by Darlan and Laval to the public have indicated their desire to make the French people unconditionally and permanently abandon their allegiance to all traditional French systems and turn to Hitler for loyalty and service. The two men are doing this solely to curry favor with Hitler."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 14th Since yesterday's statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hull condemning French Deputy Premier Darlan and former Deputy Premier Laval for adopting a pro-German policy, evidence of the deterioration of U.S.-Vichy relations has become increasingly clear today. In his statement to the public and in his communication to Vichy, Hull stated that the United States feels great sympathy for the French people but recognizes that France's leaders are leading the people down the wrong path of cooperation with Germany. Until now, the United States has been trying to maintain the U.S.-French relationship, which has become cool. The State Department's previous efforts to transport food to France and Martinique and its failure to take any decisive action, such as occupying Martinique, which would be beneficial to U.S. defense in the Caribbean, have been criticized by many, with some even saying that the United States is "appeasing" Vichy. In addition, the United States has rejected the arguments of various military experts, both domestic and foreign, that the United States should occupy Dakar to exercise its right of self-defense. The United States has also continued to keep Admiral Leahy, one of the government's most capable officials, who served as Chief of Naval Operations and Governor of Puerto Rico, stationed in Vichy. However, U.S.-French relations have been very cool since Marshal Pétain recently announced his policy of cooperation with Germany. Hull's statement also criticized Germany for being the instigator of the current war in Syria. Hull's strong statement on Vichy policy, made shortly after the nation expressed some anti-German sentiment due to the German sinking of the "Robin Moor" and as the government was expressing its intention to increase aid to China and preparing for emergencies, is noteworthy. However, it is expected that the State Department will continue to carefully consider the recall of Leahy and the severance of U.S.-French relations.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Will Not Return to His Post Will Remain in the Country in an Important Position</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 14th Reliable sources here declared yesterday that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps, currently in London, is consulting with government leaders. He will not return to Moscow. Cripps has been invited to take up an important government post. The nature of this post has not yet been disclosed.</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Drop Aerial Torpedoes German Pocket Battleship Heavily Damaged White Smoke Visible off Norwegian Coast Two German Warships Again Bombed off French Coast</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th A German pocket battleship, either the "Lutzow" (formerly the "Deutschland") or the "Admiral Scheer," was hit by a torpedo dropped by a British aircraft off the Norwegian coast yesterday morning. London believes that this ship was likely heading to the North Atlantic to prey on merchant ships to take over the work of the sunken giant battleship "Bismarck." The attacking British aircraft was a Bristol Beaufort flying at 300 miles per hour, which fired a naval torpedo weighing half a ton, hitting the pocket battleship in the middle. Thick smoke immediately billowed out. Shortly after, another similar British aircraft flew over and fired a torpedo into the smoke surrounding the German ship. The German ship immediately stopped. Several hours later, the ship was found sailing very slowly off Mandal, at the southern tip of Norway. A London spokesman claimed last night that the damage to the German pocket battleship must be severe, as it had only traveled about 50 miles to Mandal by 10:00 AM. The normal speed of German pocket battleships is 26 knots per hour. The warship may need to undergo lengthy repairs in a naval shipyard before it can return to sea. It is understood that Germany originally had two pocket battleships, namely the "Lutzow" and the "Admiral Scheer," and the "Spee," which was scuttled off the Plate River in December of the previous year after being defeated by British cruisers. These three ships each have a displacement of 10,000 tons, with a main armament of six 11-inch guns and eight 6-inch guns. It is said that their range can reach 10,000 miles. An Air Ministry communique stated that a Blenheim aircraft from the Coastal Command was patrolling off the southern coast of Norway near noon on Thursday when it spotted an enemy pocket battleship, escorted by several destroyers. After receiving the report, Coastal Command dispatched a squadron of aircraft on Friday morning to attack. The battleship was found off Egersund (south of Stavanger), and a torpedo was fired, hitting it. The ship immediately emitted white smoke, preventing the British aircraft from accurately observing the results of the attack. Shortly after 10:00 AM this morning, the battleship was stopped a few miles off Mandal at the extreme southern tip of Norway. Subsequently, all enemy ships were seen slowly sailing towards Skagerrak. One attacking British aircraft is missing. A Hudson reconnaissance aircraft shot down an enemy seaplane. An Air Ministry Information Office communique described the details of the attack, stating that a Blenheim aircraft, while pursuing a Heinkel German seaplane off the Norwegian coast, spotted a German pocket battleship escorted by five destroyers sailing north and issued a report. Coastal Command received the report and dispatched bombers to attack. A Beaufort aircraft first flew to within 100 feet and fired a torpedo, hitting the center of the ship. The German ship was caught by surprise and did not have time to fire its guns. According to the pilot, there was a destroyer in front of and on both sides of the battleship at the time to protect it from torpedo attacks, but it was still hit by a torpedo.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th With a German pocket battleship damaged by British torpedo bombers yesterday, another of Hitler's warships is out of action. Of the three pocket battleships Germany originally had, only one can now be deployed immediately. German naval designers built these pocket battleships with the aim of having the tonnage of a cruiser and the firepower of a battleship, but after testing, naval experts believe that these pocket battleships have proven disappointing because their armor is too thin to withstand heavy shells and bombs. Since the "Bismarck" suddenly appeared in the Atlantic and was destroyed, Germany now has only two giant battleships in service, namely the "Scharnhorst" and the "Gneisenau," each of 26,000 tons, which have been anchored in Brest for more than two months and have been repeatedly bombed by the British Air Force. London believes that the pocket battleship damaged yesterday was intended to sail to the Atlantic to engage in piracy, which is supported by the fact that it was escorted by several destroyers. Of the three German pocket battleships, the "Lutzow" was the first to be built in 1933, the "Admiral Scheer" was built in 1934, and the third, the "Spee," was scuttled off the Uruguayan capital.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th During the large-scale British bomber raid on Brest last night, many heavy bombs were dropped on the German warships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" and a Hipper-class cruiser.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Foreign Ministers Meet in Vienna Prince Bismarck and Others Also Attend</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Rome, 14th Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has arrived in Vienna to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Reuter's, Rome, 14th After Berlin announced that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was visiting Vienna, the Italian official news agency also announced this afternoon that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had arrived in Vienna this morning with German Minister to Italy Prince Bismarck. Bismarck is traveling under the name of German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen. Also traveling is German Minister to Croatia Polizia. Senior Viennese officials were waiting at the station.</p>

<h3>Prince George Returns to the South</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th Prince George of Yugoslavia has returned to the Yugoslav capital after 18 years away. The prince is the brother of King Alexander, who was assassinated in Marseille in October 1934. He had been receiving medical treatment in Niš since 1923 and had renounced his right to the throne several years ago.</p>
<h3>Turkey Unwavering Vigilance: Flattering Axis Powers with Cunning Words, Only Maintaining a Sense of Interest</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 14th: Mussolini recently delivered a speech, flattering Turkey, saying, "Italy will continue its policy of understanding and cooperation with Turkey." Recently, Turkey's semi-official news agency, Berlin, cited a German official as saying, "Turkey's policy aims to keep the country out of the war, and Berlin is quite satisfied." This telegram has now aroused interest in all parties, but the Turkish people's reaction to this statement is only one of maintaining a sense of interest. The Turkish people cannot be deceived by declarations, so they are not relaxing their vigilance due to the flattery of the Axis powers. Turkish newspapers have not commented on Mussolini's speech, which is quite significant.</p>

<h3>Major British Shipyard Strikes for a Day, Most Have Resumed Work, Communists are Behind It</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Manchester, 14th: The major shipyard here struck for a day. Most resumed work yesterday, but several hundred members of the mobile shipyard team had not returned to work by 10:00 PM. Port Director Jevic said yesterday that the Communists were behind this and that he would try to eliminate them. This labor unrest did not cause major delays. If bad elements can be eliminated as a result, it will turn misfortune into good fortune. Shipyard union official Donovan told reporters yesterday after a final meeting with port authorities that the lack of convenient meals was the workers' main complaint. Jevic has now promised to improve this immediately, so the matter can be resolved. As for the Communist agitation, there are now ways to deal with these people and prevent them from inciting further incidents.</p>
<h3>There Will Be a Coup in Thailand</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 14th: The Japan Times and the Hirochi Shimbun announced today that Japan cannot remain indifferent to reports of attempts to overthrow the current government of Thailand. The newspaper stated that according to news reports, Thai groups based in Singapore and Saigon are now planning to overthrow the government of Thai Prime Minister Songgram. Japan cannot ignore this activity as merely an internal political matter in Thailand, because Thailand is now an active member of Japan's "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere plan." If the Thai government is overthrown, the responsible officials of the current government, who are regarded as pro-Japanese, will be replaced even if they are not considered anti-British. Japan should examine the position of the Thai regime, which is currently under political threat, and Japan should pay more attention to Japan's position in Thailand to ensure security, as Japan has various rights to do so.</p>

<h3>Finance: Forward US Dollar Exchange Rate Trending Looser</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's listed exchange rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The grey market for the British and US currencies trended slightly firmer. However, Hong Kong Electric immediately sold off British gold after the morning opening. Chinese merchants and speculators heavily sold US dollars. There were widespread rumors that the US Treasury Secretary advocated authorizing the President to provide China with as much foreign exchange as possible, and that the US dollar would be devalued. However, foreign firms such as HSBC had considerable appetite, so the near-term US dollar closed flat. Only the July contract at 5.40625 was 0.03125 higher, and British exchange at 3/16 of a penny at 3.125 was 0.015625 looser. Trading became more active. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon.</p>

HSBC's listed exchange rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was still levied at 23.75%. Hong Kong Electric sold off £1,000 of British gold at 3/16 of a penny at 3.125, but it immediately firmed to the point where it was difficult to close the position. Later, under negative news, foreign firms still had appetite, so prices tended to stabilize. Until noon, a Western broker offered £50,000 for June delivery at 5.40625. Therefore, in the afternoon, the US dollar spot and June prices were both 5.375, still flat. The July contract at 5.40625 was 0.03125 higher, and British gold was 0.015625 higher.</p>

<h3>After Swap, Gold Market Enters Weak Path</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was weak in the grey market. The swap date for June contracts rolling into July began around 8:00 AM. The sellers initially offered 25 or 26 yuan to the buyers, but suddenly Yee Yuan actively raised the offer price, offering a huge amount of 10,000 taels. Shun Yuan also made an offer, and the price rose to 35 yuan when trading opened at 8:15 AM. Heng Kee also came forward to make an offer, raising the price further to 41 or 42 yuan. The July contract entered the market at 9:15 AM, and the price showed a tendency to fall easily and not to rise again. Due to the domestic and international situation, short sellers became more active, and had no worries after the swap. It was also rumored that the US Treasury Secretary advocated devaluing the US dollar and providing China with as much foreign exchange as possible. Chen Kee, Ta Feng, De Fu, and Yi Da in the market competed to sell off. De Da, Yu Hing, and Yung Geng Dai Xin Fung Hang poured out their holdings, so the price dropped from 6,443 yuan to 6,410 yuan, a final loss of 53 yuan in the open market and an actual drop of 11 yuan. Six or seven thousand taels were traded in the morning. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon. Spot gold was offered by Fuk Hong Yung at 210 yuan above the futures price, a small loss of a dozen yuan. Jewelry gold, customs gold, etc. remained flat.</p>
<p>July Contract Listed</p>
<p>The July contract opened at 6,440 yuan in the morning, 29 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day (June), but adding 40 yuan for the swap, it was 11 yuan higher. Under pressure from sellers, it retreated to 6,430 yuan, and buyers stepped in. It rose to 6,443 yuan, but then Heng Kee, De Fu, Ta Feng, and Chen Kee competed to sell, and since the US dollar could be settled at 5.40625 next month, the price fell by 11 yuan to 6,412 yuan. After De Fu re-entered the market, Xin Fung Yung and De Cheng also bought, and it edged up to 6,431 yuan. When negative rumors were heard, Ta Feng, Yi Da, and Chen Kee sold again, and De Da and Yu Hing Yung sold even more aggressively, so the price gradually fell by 22 yuan. At noon, it retreated to 6,410 yuan. Xin Fung Yung made a strong push to raise it slightly, and the morning close was 6,416 yuan, 53 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day (June). Subtracting the swap of 42 yuan, it was a small loss of 11 yuan. Based on the settlement price of the July US dollar at 5.40625, it was 6,442 yuan, a discount of 26 yuan. After the close, it fell to 6,412 yuan. A buyer then bought it up to 6,420 yuan. There was a difference of 33 yuan in the first half of the day. The selling price of the gold from the spot gold firms was 300 yuan higher than the futures price, and the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price.

<h3>Foreign Currencies All Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: The Shanghai market price trended weaker, and the British and US gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. Sterling notes remained fixed, and the market price remained flat. US dollar notes fell slightly by one cent, and the evening price was 18.3 yuan. Hong Kong notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained flat. Japanese and Korean gold notes both retraced slightly, the former falling to 1.93 yuan and the latter falling to 1.63 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Market Finally Weak, Slightly Comforting</h3>
<p>Industrial Bureau foreign rice continued to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon with 10,000 bags of Industrial Bureau foreign rice from Hong Kong, and berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Yu Sheng vessel also arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying 21,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 10,000 bags were also Industrial Bureau foreign rice, and the remainder were cargo. It is reported that a large batch of foreign rice will arrive from Rangoon today, loaded on a certain American vessel managed by the China Shipping Company.</p>
<p>Foreign rice saw a slight increase in trading yesterday, but the morning market was weak because of the public sale of Hong Kong rice. Then, continuing absorption by farmers in the countryside, especially in period/spot broken rice was most active, ending with 2,000 tons of #1/2 mixed broken rice being sold from Taiwan and Italy at a price of only 102.3 yuan. Many retail investors also sold, so the market flattened again. In the end, only broken rice had customers moving it, so it rose by 1-2 yuan. Other types only rose by a few cents or nearly a yuan. China Shipping's current broken rice opened at 108 yuan, falling to 107 yuan, and the April/May contract was at 106.5 yuan. A small amount of fine rice at 138 yuan still traded nearly 1,000 tons. Current rice also opened with customers buying 15-16,000 bags, high-quality broken rice at 94.3 yuan, second-quality at 79.2 yuan, #1 Saigon from 119 yuan to 116 yuan, #2 at 114 yuan to 110 yuan, #1 Siam high at 123 yuan, settled at 114 yuan, #2 at 109.5 yuan, Min Dang 122 yuan to 115.5 yuan, small grain 114.5 yuan to 112 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin Japonica domestic rice continued to sell poorly and loosen, and the market continued to be difficult to maintain, with a drop in price of 1 yuan. Fresh early and late paddy rice from South Port opened at 133.5 yuan, then down to 132 yuan, and old paddy rice from 130 yuan to 128 yuan. However, Wuxi original packaged old Japonica rice, because the price was already low, and the merchants cherished their original cost, and were unwilling to lower it further, and maintained the price at 120 yuan and 118 yuan.</p>
<p>After the rice market retreated over the past two days, holders were unwilling to lightly sell off their stocks, as there would be no rice available later. Although the way out was limited, the market did not change and remained stable. Hong Kong group grain opened at 114 yuan, group long grain at 112.5 yuan, middle grain at 111 yuan and 110 yuan, second grain at 107 yuan, glutinous green beans at 106 yuan, then down to 102 yuan, domestic grain at 120 yuan, then down to 116 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour: Local Customers Choose Cheaper Options</h3>
<p>Foreign flour continued to trade sideways. Local customers were buying actual amounts, so the market was not deserted, but buyers focused on the price, mostly choosing cheaper options. New wheat was coming onto the market, so holders had no way to push prices too high. There were also sporadic speculators participating, selling off when prices rose. Golden Dragon Flour had the most circulating volume, opening at 29.35 yuan, then being sold off by a cent and a half, and closing at 29.3 yuan. However, Flower Bird and Clock Tower brand Australian flour were in short supply and remained firm. Flower Bird Flour opened at 31.1 yuan, and Fortune God Flour at 29 yuan. A total of over 10,000 bags were traded, bought equally by local customers. It is reported that the Hua factory's cheap flour sales will end on the 26th because the raw materials are about to run out, so those who need it from the Wooden Street stores are planning to buy more.</p>
<p>There was still no active market for wheat. Although new wheat has been coming onto the market in the interior, transportation remains hopeless. Only Japanese flour mills have come forward to apply for a small number of purchase permits, and Chinese merchants have been unable to purchase it. Therefore, wheat merchants in Changshu, Wuxi, Danyang, and Pudong have contacted Japanese factories to place orders for 15,000 bags of futures at a price of 40 yuan, which will be transported to Shanghai by Chinese merchants and is currently being loaded.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Bulls Rise Again, Soybean Cake Market Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market: Rumors of poor harvests in the production areas and the removal of controlled soybeans aroused the desire of bulls. However, bears had different views and continued to sell off, resulting in a chaotic market with fluctuating prices. As a result, near-term contracts remained weak due to sluggish sales, while long-term speculative trading rose by 0.3 yuan from the previous day (and by as much as 0.5 yuan at the highest point), with a total of over 20,000 pieces traded. Kai Sheng Kee's April warehouse receipt spot cake price was 17.3 yuan to 17.5 yuan, the May upper warehouse receipt June delivery price was 17.6 yuan to 17.8 yuan, the May lower warehouse receipt June upper delivery price was 67.7 yuan to 67.75 yuan, the June upper warehouse receipt June lower delivery price was 18.8 yuan to 19.3 yuan, and the closing price was 19.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 120 bags of soybeans and 350 tins of raw oil were shipped to Xiamen, and 1,440 pieces of soybean cake, 1,230 bags of soybeans, and 150 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures Sugar Settlement Method Announced, Refined White Rises and Falls Again… Stocks Increase Daily</h3>
<p>The futures sugar settlement method has not been publicly announced. After the newspaper published a summary of readers' letters, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association sent a letter yesterday with two announcements attached. The original letter and announcements are hereby selectively published below:</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the report in your esteemed newspaper on the 13th of this month's commercial news about the settlement method for wood futures sugar, which stated that it has not yet been publicly announced, this is inaccurate. The incident originated on the 5th of this month, because the sugar price fluctuated too sharply on that day, causing disputes between buyers and sellers. In view of the seriousness of the situation, which was not in the interest of the industry, our Association was forced to announce a temporary suspension of trading in order to resolve the disputes and stabilize the industry. After repeated meetings and discussions, public opinions were adopted, and a mutually beneficial solution was agreed upon. The industry also unanimously agreed that it was fair. Two issues of price suppression and settlement methods were announced in the industry market on the 7th and 11th of this month, and the final delivery procedures were carried out. Fortunately, the industry was able to take the overall situation into consideration, and the procedures were smooth. The hard work of our Association has always been understood by all parties. Because the reporter who published the previous news still has some misunderstandings despite the announcement, we are now enclosing two copies of the announcement method and respectfully request that you publish them in your esteemed newspaper.</p>
<p>Shanghai Sugar Industry Association</p>
<p>(1) The settlement method for the June 10th coarse sugar is as follows: for成交價 prices of 103 yuan or more, the price will be reduced by 5 yuan per dan. For prices of 102 yuan to 102.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 4.5 yuan per dan. For prices of 101 yuan to 101.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 4 yuan. For prices of 100 yuan to 100.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 2.5 yuan. For prices of 99 yuan to 99.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 2 yuan. For prices of 98 yuan to 98.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 2.5 yuan. For prices of 97 yuan to 97.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 2 yuan. For prices of 96 yuan to 96.5 yuan, the price will be reduced by 1.5 yuan. For prices of 95 yuan to 95.5 yuan, the price will be reduced by 1 yuan. For prices of 93.5 yuan to 94.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 0.5 yuan. Prices of 93.05 yuan to 93.45 yuan, and prices below 93 yuan, will be calculated at 93 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The settlement method for the June 20th crude sugar is as follows: for prices of 98 yuan to 98.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 2.15 yuan per dan. For prices of 97 yuan to 97.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 1.75 yuan. For prices of 96 yuan to 96.95 yuan, the price will be reduced by 1.25 yuan. Prices of 94.05 yuan to 94.75 yuan, will be calculated at a settlement price of 94 yuan. Those who mutually swap the June 10th and 20th crude sugar contracts should return the original discount price, whether it is 1 yuan or more. The fixed price for the June 20th crude sugar is 94 yuan. If there is a surplus in the discount price, it should be returned, and if there is a deficit, it should be paid.</p>
<p>The sugar market trend remained weak yesterday and declined again. The Association set the price for spot 2/4 grade refined white sugar from the outer warehouses at 90 yuan to 89 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. April imports at 87.9 yuan, 87.7 yuan, and 87.5 yuan, March imports at 87 yuan, down 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 70.5 yuan to 69 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. Taikoo white sugar B mark was 108 yuan, DY mark was 95 yuan, with little fluctuation. HX Kazhuo was flat at first and then softened to 88.5 yuan, 88.3 yuan, and 88 yuan, down 0.5 yuan, with no other trades. On the 14th, 290 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Since the supply of foreign sugar has recently exceeded demand, stocks are increasing daily. Dutch red and white sugar accounts for the largest amount, totaling 236,066 bags. Those from Hong Kong are still outside, and including Taikoo car sugar, the total reaches 373,566 bags. The details of each grade are listed below:</p>
<p>Category  Quantity</p>
<p>Dutch Coarse White 236,066</p>
<p>Dutch Red 62,592</p>
<p>Raw Sand 4,798</p>
<p>Bowls 759</p>
<p>Taikoo White B 13,088</p>
<p>CX 180</p>
<p>DY 17,163</p>
<p>H Red 5,440</p>
<p>Car Ice CC 4,780</p>
<p>Coarse White Soft White 25,000</p>
<p>(From Hong Kong)</p>
<h3>Yarn/Cotton: Factory Sources Tight, Yarn Prices Rise Again, Double Horse Continues to Export, Floating Positions Covered Actively</h3>
<p>The yarn market trended upward after trading sideways. This was due to the tight factory orders. At the same time, it was said that Guangdong merchants borrowed 300-400 bales of warehouse receipts from small companies and swapped them with the factory for spot goods to be exported. This boosted market sentiment, and floating positions were actively covered. The market was tight and prices rose. Currently, the yarn market is moving towards higher levels, but most small companies have a large number of short positions, and the idea of covering them is becoming more active. Therefore, according to this observation, Double Horse factory orders still have room to rise. If they rise to around 1,500 yuan, there may be a small correction. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,478 yuan, and the low price was 1,465 yuan. Because the market was closed in the afternoon due to the weekend, it was said that bids were being placed at 1,477 or 1,478 yuan. 590 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The Double Horse morning market opened calmly. The opening price was 1,465 yuan, and buyers were still keenly interested. It soon rose to 1,472 yuan. It was said in the market that Hong Kong merchants had bought several hundred bales of Double Horse, and market sentiment suddenly tightened, and buying became strong. It rose to 1,478 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the standard gold swap, it softened somewhat, and profits were taken, suddenly falling back to 1,470 yuan. The closing price recovered to 1,475 yuan. Statistics show that 9,400 bales were traded in the morning, including 100 bales bought by Hong Kong merchants and 9,300 bales by local merchants.</p>
<p>The Golden Double Horse Standard Yarn market was slightly positive, and prices rose slowly. The July contract rose by 4.5 yuan, and the August contract did not move. Statistics show that over 4,000 bales were traded throughout the day. The market was closed in the afternoon. The high, low, and closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>前市 (Morning Market)   前市 (Morning Market)</p>
<p>七月開 (July Open) 1393   八月開 (August Open) 1406</p>
<p>收 (Close) 1395.5 收 (Close) 140.1</p>
<p>高 (High) 1400 高 (High) 1406</p>
<p>低 (Low) 1393  低 (Low) 1400</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Mills Compete to Buy Brazilian Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is very firm. This is because American cotton is rising steadily, so there is no decrease in fine velvet cotton. At the same time, Germany is constantly purchasing American cotton from Shanghai, which has fueled market sentiment. Because of the weekend, yesterday's trading volume was less than the previous day. Buyers complained that the price of fine velvet cotton was too high, but holders still felt that it was not enough. As a result, factories have gradually turned their attention to rough velvet raw materials, and cotton firms are following suit. Transactions have gradually increased. Yesterday, a total of 2,095 pieces and 4,278 bales were traded. Fine velvet cotton rose by 1-2 yuan, and rough velvet cotton remained flat.</p>

<p>Hui Si Deng 336.5  Cotton Firm  595 pieces  Warehouse delivery</p>
<p>According to other reports, foreign cotton trading at Hong Kong ports seems to be particularly active due to the excitement of the market and the firm prices of American and Indian cotton. Although yesterday was the weekend, over 1,000 bales were traded in half a day. Brazilian cotton was particularly popular, and various foreign cotton mills bought large quantities. At the same time, cotton firms were not to be outdone, and small-scale transactions were also good.</p>
<p>New York cotton market: initially fell due to unfavorable weather reports for bulls, but then recovered due to buying by colleagues and short covering. As a result, the closing price was 15-6 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>According to another telegram, the American cotton statistics from August 1, last year to June 13, this year are recorded below (each bale is 500 pounds):</p>
<p>Cumulative Listing</p>
<p>2,363,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Factory Usage  8,999,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports  995,000 bales</p>
<p>To Japan  114,000 bales</p>
<p>To China  74,400 bales</p>
<p>To England  275,000 bales</p>
<p>To Germany  139,000 bales</p>
<p>Stocks in various ports  5,781,000 bales</p>
<p>Indian cotton market: initially rose due to strong buying by the public, but then fell slightly due to some profit-taking and retail sales. Yesterday's closing prices, except for White Lotto Go in July/August, which fell by 0.7 rupees, all rose by 2-7 rupees.</p>
<p>It is predicted that the market will open higher today.</p>
<h3>Securities: Abundant Capital, Domestic Debt Turns Upward Again</h3>
<p>The public debt grey market turned upward again yesterday. Various groups were buying actively, and market sentiment was excellent. There were rumors of peace talks and of interest rate reductions. With the current abundance of capital, banks are continuing to buy, bulls are increasing their positions, and shorts are covering. Although Hongda was selling off, supply and demand remained unbalanced. Internal debt once again surged past the 70 yuan mark, but retreated due to the rapid rise. The eleventh installment of interest is gradually approaching, and shorts are wary. Therefore, those who are currently shorting are in the opportunity to cover old short positions, so the trend is easy to rise and difficult to fall, and the future outlook remains positive. Many shorts are still hoping to find an opportunity to cover their positions. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held. At the opening, internal debt opened at 70 yuan. Lianhe, Xinyuan, Yu Da, Hengfu, and others were actively buying. Xinfu and Hefeng were increasing their positions. Shengda, Dingkang, and Xiekang were covering shorts. De Ban, Yitai, Gong Mao, and others were selling. Runde was also closing positions. Hongda sold off after buying initially. Yichang, Jiufeng, and Renfeng were all selling off. Yu Yu and Heng Kang were selling Type A bonds. Yu Da's continuous purchases on behalf of a certain bank were the most noteworthy and competitive. As a result, prices all rose by 0.1-0.35 yuan. Approximately 1.5 million yuan was traded. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branch Production Prices Rise</h3>
<p>It is now a fact that the harvest of orchid bamboo branches is very poor this year. Therefore, production prices are also high. The declared cost is one-third higher than the old goods. It is found that the current Shanghai stocks are limited, but now that the mold season has arrived, the cost of cold storage or baking will increase by at least 10-20 yuan. Therefore, the selling price of the trade has also risen.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Temporary Measures for Subsidizing Vocational School Material Fees, Subject to Verification and Approval by Competent Authorities</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education, in order to maintain the practice materials of vocational schools in various regions, has specially formulated temporary measures for subsidizing the practice material fees of vocational schools and promulgated them for implementation. The full text of the measures is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Ministry hereby formulates these measures to ensure that vocational schools in various regions have adequate funds for practice materials and to avoid discounts.</p>
<p>2.  If the practice material fees for students in vocational schools specializing in industry, agriculture, and home economics in various regions are insufficient or cannot be maintained due to discounts, the competent educational administrative authorities may verify the actual situation, provide reasons, and report to the Ministry for approval before granting subsidies.</p>
<p>3.  The educational administrative authorities in various regions shall submit a list of the allocated practice material subsidies, including the names of the schools and the amount of subsidies, to the Ministry.</p>
<p>4.  The subsidy for practice materials is tentatively set for the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941]. Starting from the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], public schools should have their material fees increased by the competent educational administrative authorities of each province and city, or be paid in full according to the original amount, or raise funds to subsidize. Private schools may still seek subsidies from the Ministry.</p>
<p>5.  Subsidized vocational schools should report the practice situation, output quantity, sales status, etc., to the Ministry for record at the end of each semester.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Passes the Report of the Special Education Committee</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the report of the Special Education Committee has been published and printed as a special gazette. The aforementioned report has been forwarded to the Council by the Standing Education Committee and has been approved. The recommendations in the report are briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The responsibility for educational facilities fundamentally rests with the resident communities of various countries. The Shanghai Municipal Council only bears the responsibility of assistance.</p>
<p>2.  The Shanghai Municipal Council's educational policy should focus on expanding the subsidy system, increasing the number of schools established by resident communities of various countries, and strictly limiting the direct operation of schools with municipal funds.</p>
<p>3.  The Shanghai Municipal Council's allocation of educational funds is currently limited to the income equivalent to two percent of the property tax. This restriction should be abolished immediately, and sufficient funds should be temporarily allocated to maintain all current educational work.</p>
<p>4.  The educational funds used for the benefit of Chinese, Japanese, and Western children should be distributed in proportion to the taxes paid by the Chinese, Japanese, and Western communities.</p>
<p>5.  When financial conditions permit, additional educational funds exceeding the temporary limit mentioned in item 3 should be allocated immediately. The allocation of these additional funds should prioritize convenience and the realization of the principles stated in item 4.</p>
<p>6.  Transferring the management or economic responsibility of existing Council-run schools to resident communities of various countries, although theoretically consistent with the principles listed in items 1, 2, and 4 and a suitable measure, is not feasible under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>7.  Educational subsidies should be allocated by a relevant subcommittee according to more flexible new principles, so that in addition to subsidizing existing schools, special education programs that benefit the entire International Settlement can be established and promoted.</p>
<p>8.  Schools that aim to make a profit should not be given subsidies.</p>
<p>9.  All schools subsidized by the Shanghai Municipal Council should be subject to educational inspection by personnel sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>10. The direct costs of running Council-run schools should be recovered from tuition fees as much as possible, to the extent that parents of students are not burdened excessively.</p>
<p>11. The position of Director of the Education Department should continue to exist after the retirement of the current director. Photograph of Dr. Bu Fangji of St. John's University leaving Shanghai to return to the United States (taken by H.F. Pan).</p>

<h3>Japan Has No Intention of Large-Scale Southern Advance; Its Purpose Is to Constantly Harass, Restrain British and American Forces, and Secretly Assist the Axis Powers; But Malaya and the Dutch East Indies Have Strong Strength; American Reporter Caine Returns to Shanghai and Analyzes the Situation in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>American New York Report correspondent Mr. Caine left Shanghai in March, traveled to Nanyang via Hong Kong to visit Manila and Singapore, and after four months, just returned here via the original route. He talked to a reporter, saying that according to the American military observers in Manila, Japan's entire policy in the South Pacific is to constantly harass, causing the British, American, and Dutch East Indies authorities to constantly worry about invasions by sea and land, thus restraining the American Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, and keeping tens of thousands of British troops in Malaya. It is an important factor that these troops, if transferred to other theaters of war to fight against the Axis forces.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Force Japan to Get Involved in the Vortex</p>
<p>The observer also discussed the rumor that Hitler and Mussolini tried to force Japan to fight against Britain and the United States in the South Pacific. He believed that Japan is now creating trouble, making the situation in the South Pacific reach the most tense state except for a real war, so as to fulfill its greatest assistance to the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Japan Will Not Attack Rashly</p>
<p>Caine continued, saying that when he left Singapore, the general feeling there was that Japan would not attempt to attack in the South Pacific. If Germany can achieve great gains in the Middle East and obtain the Suez Canal, Japan may take the opportunity to use troops, passing through Singapore to take the Dutch East Indies. Six months ago, the defenses of British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies were not strong, especially the air defenses. But now it is very different. The defenses of the two places are extremely strong.</p>
<p>Air Defense Strengthened, American Aircraft Arrive</p>
<p>Six months ago, Malaya had no fighter jets, only Blenheim fighter-bombers, Lockheed Hudson bombers, and other British-made bombers. But this shortcoming has been remedied in the past few months. A large number of American Brewster Buffalo fighter planes have been shipped in. The British Air Force pilots stationed there all praised the speed and flexibility of this American aircraft. Some pilots even said that this fighter plane is more convenient than the famous British Spitfire fighter plane when operating in the sky below 10,000 feet, only the firepower is weaker. Recently, Australian Wirraway dive bombers have also been shipped to Malaya. They are all single-seat aircraft made in Australia according to American drawings.</p>
<p>More Than Enough to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Malaya now has regular Australian troops stationed, the first batch of which arrived in March. There is also an Australian Air Force team that has already arrived in Malaya and is stationed at a large airfield. New Zealanders are also serving in the British and Australian Air Force. In addition, American military supplies have also arrived in Singapore in large quantities. With the substantial increase in land and air forces, military observers feel that Malaya's defenses are more than enough to resist Japanese forces sent to attack.</p>
<p>United Front of the United States, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Caine also said that although there has been no treaty announced on the cooperation of the US and British navies in defending Singapore, the general public believes that the two countries have reached a mutual understanding. This is a powerful factor in containing Japan's coveting of the South Pacific. He did not travel to the Dutch East Indies on this trip, but heard reliable news that the military defense and air force of the area have been greatly enhanced in the past six months. He also saw a large number of troops and various aircraft arriving in the Philippines, and the defenses are becoming increasingly strong. According to the US observers in the Philippines, if Japan continues to have the possibility of invading the south, the US Pacific Fleet will never be transferred to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Newly Opened Routes, Smooth Access to All Places</p>
<p>Regarding the opening of the Pan American Clipper flying boat route to Singapore, Caine claimed that this move reduced the time for Singapore mail to the United States from three weeks to one month to six days, and the time to the United Kingdom from three months to about twelve days. With the Clipper's business connection, Singapore has become one of the major aviation centers in the Far East, because there are Dutch, British, and American commercial aircraft connecting the Dutch East Indies, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Siam. Caine finally said that when he was in Singapore in March and April, major American news agencies, newspapers, magazines, and newsreel companies all had representatives go to Singapore to collect materials.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Leaves Shanghai for Japan; Zhou Fohai, Lin Baisheng, and Others Accompany Him</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Wang Jingwei left Shanghai for Japan on the Japanese mail ship Yawata Maru today (the 14th). Those traveling with him include Zhou Fohai, Lin Baisheng, and others. According to a press release issued by the Japanese Consulate General in this city, Wang and his subordinates will arrive in Kobe on the 16th and Tokyo the next day. It also stated that Wang will hold discussions with Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and the Army, Navy, and Finance Ministers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Civil Service Board to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss the Issue of Salary Increases for Staff</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting on the 11th of this month, it was decided that the issue of salary increases requested by the council's staff would be submitted to the Civil Service Board for study. It has been learned that the board is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:30 PM on the 16th to discuss this issue.</p>
<h3>Keswick's Activities in the United States; Adjusting Far East Shipping; Withdrawing Ships from Various Routes to Supply the British Army</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the British shipping industry in this city, Mr. W.J. Keswick, the manager of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been in Washington, D.C., in the United States, since April 25th, when he took the President Coolidge to the United States on the pretext of returning to visit his wife. He is presiding over a plan to reallocate and distribute British, American, Australian, and Chinese commercial vessels in the Pacific and Indian Oceans to expand British ships in the Atlantic and maintain the "lifeline" of British and American Atlantic transportation.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong Shipping Companies Fully Supply</p>
<p>It is reported that Keswick's plan is about to be completed. He has consulted with the British Shipping Commission, the US State Department, and many Far East shipping experts on the method. Keswick himself is responsible for contacting on behalf of the British shipping industry in the Far East. It is believed that Keswick has clearly stated to the relevant authorities in the United States that the shipping industry in Shanghai and Hong Kong is willing to make any necessary sacrifices to maintain the needs of British transportation.</p>
<p>British and Greek Ships Transferred to the Atlantic</p>
<p>It is said that the plan currently under discussion is to withdraw British and Greek ships that are still engaged in Far East trade and send them to the Atlantic Ocean, and to replace them with American-style Chinese merchant ships to operate on the Far East routes, so that the traditional shipping in the Far East will not be seriously affected. The withdrawal of these ships will include British merchant ships currently sailing between Japan, India, and Japan-China. In addition, Chinese sea ships or cargo ships will operate part of the original routes of the British ships to maintain trade and protect interests. At the same time, the Queen ships of the Changxing Shipping Company in the Pacific will also be suspended and transferred to the Atlantic or another territory for military use.</p>
<p>American Ships Replace British Ships</p>
<p>As for American shipping in the Pacific, although the number of ships has been reduced due to the government's requisition for military use, there are still sufficient numbers to replace British ships. The purpose of this ship transfer plan is to increase the number of ships to transport urgently needed goods from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Middle East, to reduce the constraints of the US Neutrality Act, and to allow the United Kingdom to still have room to breathe.</p>
<p>A Large Number of New Ships Are Being Built</p>
<p>At the same time, the US government is rushing to build new ships to meet the needs of transportation to aid Britain and China. There are currently 200 cargo ships of 7,500 tons each being rushed to build in shipyards across the United States, at a cost of US$200 million. It is expected to be completed and distributed to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans within the year to make up for the shortage of ships. In addition, the American Mail Line is also rushing to build three new world-class ships that have not yet been completed to maintain the Far East-British shipping industry after the ships are requisitioned for military use. A news agency reporter once inquired about this plan from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., the American Mail Line, and Changxing Shipping Company in this city, but they all remained silent and refused to comment. However, everyone believes that Keswick's mission in the United States is closely related to the three companies.</p>
<h3>US Military in Western Shanghai Strengthens Defenses</h3>
<p>Along the border of the US military defense zone in western Shanghai, such as the key entrances and exits in the Haig Road area, the US military suddenly placed sandbags in front of the barbed wire at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, forming bunkers, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, similar sand fortresses were set up at the intersection of Fuxu Road. It is reported that this arrangement is nothing more than to strengthen defenses. Therefore, vehicles and pedestrians entering and leaving the area have been more strictly searched since the night before last. Even those with curfews passes still need to show their passes and be searched for contraband. At the same time, the French Concession has also strengthened its defenses, with detectives and patrols from the police department seen everywhere on the roads, and iron nets are set up at key intersections at any time to carry out temporary searches.</p>
<h3>Authorities Mediate Labor Disputes in Public Utilities</h3>
<p>More than 50 employees of the Royal Hotel at 2004 Jing'an Temple Road have repeatedly requested their employers to increase their salaries due to financial difficulties, but to no avail. All employees were forced to go on strike at 11:00 AM yesterday and formally submitted ten demands to the employers. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Royal Hotel Employees Go on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>(1) Those with salaries above $335 will receive a 75% increase; those with salaries above $20 will receive a 100% increase; those with salaries below $20 will receive a 150% increase. (2) An additional five dou of rice per person per month will be provided, calculated at the market price. (3) Employees shall not be dismissed without reason. (4) Salaries will be paid for 14 months per year, with the other two months used as year-end bonuses. (5) If an employee becomes ill due to work, the employer should bear the medical expenses, and the employee's salary and rice subsidy should continue to be paid during the illness. (6) Each employee must have one day off per week. (7) The employee is not responsible for compensating for damage to public property due to work. (8) An additional 5% of customer service fees (10% in total) will be distributed by the employees themselves. (9) Employees who have served for more than ten years should be given a pension by the employer when they retire due to old age. If they unfortunately die from illness, the employer should provide a condolence payment of $1,000. (10) Salaries and allowances will be paid as usual during the strike.</p>
<p>Mediation of Disputes in Public Utilities</p>
<p>The three major public utilities in the Public Concession: (1) The Waterworks Company has had unfortunate incidents such as strikes due to the labor side's dissatisfaction with the company's reduction of new measures. It has been half a month, and there have been disturbances before, and it is still deadlocked. (2) More than 200 workers at the Met Herst Road Telephone Company have been struggling to make ends meet due to the impact of high rice prices and high salaries. They submitted a request to the company on the 11th of this month, but have not received a satisfactory response. Fortunately, the labor side has taken the overall situation into consideration, and the order is quite good. There have been no unfortunate incidents such as strikes. (3) Regarding the labor dispute at the Nichengqiao Fireworks Company, it is learned that the Political Department of the Public Concession has sent personnel to the companies to investigate the truth of the dispute and collect mediation information. It has been decided to convene the labor side of the above-mentioned three companies next week (tomorrow) to collect opinions, and then schedule another meeting with the representatives of both labor and management of the three companies to fairly mediate.</p>
<p>Honey Factory Strike Resolved</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Honey Velvet Factory on Poyang Road has been going on for many days. As a result of the talks between labor and management on Friday (13th) of this week, it has been fully resolved. At the same time, 100 striking workers at the Huxi Zhongzheng (transliteration) Weaving Factory have also announced their return to work. Yesterday, there was suddenly a brewing of a strike at the Asia Oil Company. It is said that the workers had previously requested that if the workers were dismissed by the employer, each person must receive a bonus of $2,000, and at the same time, they also requested improved treatment. Therefore, the company is preparing to lay off employees, and the workers have discussed the matter of a strike. The strike situation at the Muller Factory in Pudong remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>YMCA Health Campaign: Last Day Today</h3>
<p>The YMCA's summer health campaign, which opened the day before yesterday at the Eight Immortals Bridge Clubhouse, will last for three days. Nearly 10,000 people visit each day, causing a sensation. Today is the last day and will close at 11:00 PM. The situation today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibition Items</p>
<p>The main items of the association's promotion include the exhibition of various hygiene products such as microscopes, models, and charts, cleaning products, and comparative photos of cleanliness and small cleanliness, as well as specimens of various diseases.

<h3>British-Owned Public Buses Not Sold to Japanese Businesses; Company Deputy Manager Makes Official Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Arnold Jones, deputy manager of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, yesterday morning (the 14th) denied rumors that the company had been sold to Japanese businesses. He said that he was unaware of such a transaction and that all the reports were untrue. According to a report in a certain newspaper yesterday morning, the Public Concession Public Bus Company will soon be sold to a Japanese business in this city, and that "company owner" Victor Sassoon had negotiated with Japanese business representatives several times. In fact, Sir Victor Sassoon has left Shanghai for the United States several months ago and is currently in New York.</p>

<h3>Fourty Thousand Bags of Min Party Rice Already Ordered, Small Grain Rice Procurement Continues, Reasons for Bureau's Min Party Rice Procurement Undisclosed</h3>
<p>Previously, the Public Concession's工部局, in order to lower rice prices and safeguard the people's food supply, agreed with the Hong Kong government to ship foreign rice to Shanghai from Hong Kong on a monthly basis. Since its implementation, it has been very effective, and rice prices have indeed fallen. In addition to procuring small grain rice, the 工部局 also procures special Min Party仰光 rice. Grain merchants and rice shops believe that the existing Min Party rice supply in Shanghai is limited and easier to sell, and the price is low. Orders have been very enthusiastic for days. As of yesterday, the quantity has exceeded 40,000 bags.</p>
<p>Small Grains, Min Party, Both Procured</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported news from the New Sound Society新聲社, stating that Hong Kong's rice supply to Shanghai will switch to Min Party rice and reduce the selling price. This caused rice industry insiders to inquire with the flat-price rice agency. According to the person in charge speaking to a Pingming Society平明社 reporter yesterday: (1) The 工部局 is thoroughly resolving the city's food panic, so in addition to handling small grain rice, it is also handling Min Party rice. It is not changing to Min Party rice due to a shortage of small grain rice. However, from now on, small grain rice and Min Party rice will be accepted concurrently. When small grain rice arrives, small grain rice will be sold, and when Min Party rice arrives, Min Party rice will be sold. (2) As for the rumor that the 工部局's Min Party rice will be sold in Shanghai at a further reduced price, it is even more absurd. The selling price of Min Party rice has been agreed upon by the 工部局 and the flat-price rice agency. The wholesale price to wholesale merchants is 127.2角 per bag, and the wholesale merchants are not allowed to sell to retail rice shops for more than 136.25 yuan per bag. The retail price at each retail rice shop is set at 112 yuan per shi石. Where is the so-called further reduction? (3) This special Min Party rice will begin loading ships and departing this month and there is no need to wait until next month (July) for the first batch. Currently, the 工部局 has not announced the situation of Min Party rice procurement, so the truth is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Flat-Price Grain Rice Arriving Daily</p>
<p>The Fusheng阜生 vessel, which arrived in port the day before yesterday, has completely unloaded 10,000 bags of flat-price small grain rice. Yesterday, retail rice shops began to ship goods to meet market demand. At the same time, yesterday morning, another 20,000 bags of flat-price small grain rice were shipped to Shanghai, carried by the Taigu太古 company's Taiyuan太原 vessel (docked at Taigu Wharf) and the Yihuo怡和 company's Yusheng裕生 vessel (docked at Roosevelt羅斯福 Wharf). In addition, the Yuansheng元生 and Ninghai寗海 vessels, carrying a total of 20,000 bags of flat-price small grain rice, are expected to arrive in port within one or two days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Chongren's Painting Exhibition Opens This Morning at the YMCA, Limited to Five Days</h3>
<p>The famous artist Zhang Chongren張充仁 has immersed himself in his studio for five years. Usually, in addition to guiding students in their studies, he rarely interacts with the outside world. Now, Mr. Zhang is exhibiting more than 30 of his best works (oil paintings) from the past five years, one sculpture, and over 70 old works borrowed from various places, as well as over 30 masterpieces by his disciples, starting at 9:00 AM today until the 19th. The exhibition will be held in the east hall on the second floor of the YMCA, next door to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road靜安寺路. Among the works, "Compassion惻隱之心" is a huge oil painting of over a zhang丈 in size, with a grand and imposing atmosphere, representing the spirit of human mutual assistance during wartime, which is inspiring. The misery of the "Exile流亡" scene, even for those who have not experienced it firsthand, should feel the cruelty of war. The rest, such as landscapes, portraits, still lifes, etc., are all lifelike and dazzling. They are truly rare works in recent exhibitions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants' Goods Certificate, Alternative Measures</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified relevant industries in order to facilitate the certification procedures for goods shipped abroad, stating, "Since June 1st, the national goods certification list issued by our association, in accordance with the 'Notice on Applying for Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Freight Certificate', has been handled by Hong Kong. Various industries feel that there are more twists and turns and it is quite inconvenient. Representatives have repeatedly requested our association for alternative measures. After careful consideration, it is now decided that, starting from the 1st, except for certificate lists that are transferred to the mainland through ports such as Zhejiang and Fujian, or directly transported from Shanghai to foreign countries, or with Hong Kong as the destination, will still be filled out as before. Certificates for prohibited goods and national goods/Western goods certificates for goods transported to various places in the Southwest or transported to Hong Kong and then transshipped to the Southwest or foreign countries will be filled out by the Hong Kong office of our association at Shanghai Merchants Association, 2nd Floor, 6 Queen's Road. Therefore, commodities directly transported from Shanghai to foreign countries do not need to be signed in Hong Kong again. It is beneficial in terms of time and cost.

<h3>Panama's Large-Scale Anti-Chinese Movement, Overseas Chinese Express Their Opinions, Shanghai and Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Jointly Telegraph, Requesting the U.S. Authorities to Mediate and Eliminate the Conflict</h3>
<p>Since the end of last year, Panama in Central America passed a law in Congress specifying the prohibition of Chinese people from entering the country and canceling all Panamanian nationality rights for the children of local-born overseas Chinese. The development of the situation is extremely serious. Recently, due to the pressure of the environment, there have been five batches of overseas Chinese returning to China, the fifth batch totaling 173 people, who recently returned to China on the U.S. Postal Ship Company's President Cleveland克利扶倫. There are still hundreds of people remaining in that place waiting for ships to return to China. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Mr. So-and-so, an overseas Chinese from Panama who had recently arrived in Shanghai, who told the reporter about the</p>
<p>Facts of Anti-Chinese Discrimination</p>
<p>"The anti-Chinese trend in Panama occurred under the Panamanian government's advocacy of eliminating people of color and implementing the 'Panama for Panamanians' ideology. This ideology mainly targets our overseas Chinese. In 1930, the Immigration Law was enacted, prohibiting people of color from entering the country, especially strictly restricting our overseas Chinese from entering the country. Until 1939, during the tenure of former President Rosania羅士尼亞, he announced the arrest of Chinese holding local-born certificates, and more than 50 people were arrested and deported successively. He also ordered the arrest and deportation of all Chinese holding this type of local-born certificate throughout the country. Therefore, our overseas Chinese in Panama were greatly affected. Later, the Panamanian government actually transferred the detained local-born Chinese into</p>
<p>Long-Term Imprisonment</p>
<p>The situation became even more serious. At this time, the consuls submitted representations and guaranteed the release of the detained Chinese. However, the Panamanian government stated that they still had to leave the country within six months and had to prepare their own tickets. However, they generally had no passports, and the shipping companies refused to sell them. The Panamanian government did not recognize them as Panamanian nationals and could not issue any documents, resulting in a stalemate. At this point, our country's consuls had to issue them Chinese passports, which officially recognized them as Chinese in fact. The Panamanian authorities were able to follow the precedent and recognize that they were not Panamanian nationals, which led to even more severe actions. The salespeople of all overseas Chinese bars, restaurants, and food stores must have their bodies examined by local government doctors to determine whether they are eligible to sell food. Only those who pass the examination will be given a health certificate and allowed to work. However, among the white people who went for the examination, only three or five people passed, and the rest were identified as having diseases and were not allowed to work. There were also other 'Seventy-Five' labor regulations, which greatly affected the stores. Many automatically closed down and returned to China. There have been five batches successively, totaling nearly a thousand people, who are now living in Shanghai and Hong Kong. They have formed a special delegation to jointly telegraph the highest authorities to urge early negotiation with the Panamanian</p>
<p>Government Negotiations</p>
<p>In order to maintain the livelihoods of thousands of overseas Chinese, the telegram said, '(Titles omitted) We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from overseas Chinese in Panama and reports from overseas Chinese recently forced to return home. Since the new president took office in Panama, anti-Chinese discrimination has become even more severe. Our overseas Chinese businesses are arbitrarily destroyed and seized, or heavy fines are imposed, or they are arrested and imprisoned, or deported. All kinds of harshness are unspeakable. Now, the overseas Chinese in that area cannot gain a foothold and hundreds of people are preparing to leave the country. If no measures are taken to rescue them urgently, not only will all overseas Chinese be bankrupt, but our national economy will also be greatly affected. Among the countries in Central and South America, the United States is the leader. At this time when China and the United States are on the same front, it is surprising that Panama has such contradictory measures. We earnestly request that the United States be urged to mediate and eliminate Panama's anti-Chinese discrimination, and that cadres be sent to Panama to seriously negotiate in order to alleviate the crisis.'

<h3>French Newspaper Reports Death of Tatung Merchant, States It May Be Related to Politics</h3>
<p>After the Tatung merchant lawyer was shot and killed, according to the French newspaper, only one person fired the gun, who seemed to be very familiar with the scene.

<h3>Don't Be Proud</h3>
<p>— Wang Tao王韜</p>
<p>In the world, countless people have ruined their futures because of pride. Due to a moment of success, they become arrogant and self-important, considering their initial success as a masterpiece that surpasses everything else. They look down on others and despise their work. But when others continue to work hard, unyielding, and achieve true success and victory, they are still stuck in the initial stage of success. Therefore, they fail.</p>
<p>Little friends, don't you want to end in failure? Then never be proud. We must humbly learn, accept the guidance and opinions of others with humility, improve our success step by step, and gradually reach the final destination of success.</p>
<p>Many children become proud because their grades or scores are higher than others. This is a very undesirable tendency. For example, a child who is studying at school and gets the highest score in the first monthly exam should work harder and strive to maintain their original performance in the second monthly exam. However, they do not do this. Having achieved the first place this time, they become proud. They look down on other classmates, thinking that their grades are worse than theirs. Therefore, they do not work as hard as before. But other classmates work harder than them. Obviously, in the second monthly exam, they are bound to encounter failure.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, we should not be proud first, because pride hinders you!</p>
<p>Little friends, do you want success and victory? Then, please remember: don't be proud!</p>
<h3>Three Hundred Warriors</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xiang志向</p>
<p>It is in Greece, where the flames of war have just subsided, that a thousand years ago this country occupied an important position in the Balkan Peninsula of Southern Europe, and its people were the most civilized group in the world at that time. While other peoples were still living a semi-civilized life, Greece, like our country, built magnificent cities, and the emergence of poetry, fairy tales, fables, and other literary works made it the birthplace of art and literature throughout the world.</p>
<p>But there is also a strong spirit of protecting the country.</p>
<p>The King of Persia in the East admired this land. He immediately invaded Greece from Asia, and his huge army could easily occupy the entire country.</p>
<p>However, the Greek people, who loved their country, took up arms to defend their motherland, not fighting for any tyrant. The Persian King whipped the people to invade for his own interests.</p>
<p>The Persian King led his army, proudly and slowly advancing from north to south. Thermopylae薩摩潑李, a narrow road that must be passed from north to south, is located between two high mountains. If he slowed down the attack a little, the Greek people would have more time to prepare for resistance, and even have enough strength to defeat the Persian King's army.</p>
<p>At that time, King Leonidas李揚黎特斯 of Sparta斯巴達, one of the Greek federations, led one hundred warriors to defend this narrow road. This narrow road only needs one person to defend it, and it can resist ten thousand men. Soon, the Persian King arrived. He despised this small number of three hundred warriors, thinking that they would be scared away by his tens of thousands of troops.</p>
<p>Leonidas took the lead in attacking the Persian King, so the battle began, and the Persian King never gained victory.</p>
<p>The Persian King received help from a traitor and encircled the rear of Leonidas. At dawn, he and the three hundred warriors all sacrificed themselves for their country.</p>
<p>Their hot blood was not wasted. In just a few months, the Greek army was quickly formed and immediately shattered the Persian King's dream of invasion.</p>
<p>In the narrow road of Thermopylae, there sits a stone lion, inscribed with "We died here for our country. We hope that those who come later will defend our country despite the difficulties."</p>
<p>Therefore, in this Balkan War, Greece did not surrender without a fight like Czechoslovakia捷克斯拉夫.</p>
<h3>Learning from Gorky</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiaju張家駒</p>
<p>May 18th this year is the fifth anniversary of the death of the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky高爾基. According to reports in the newspaper, the Soviet authorities and people enthusiastically held solemn commemorative ceremonies on that day to commemorate this giant.</p>
<p>Why is Gorky worthy of such admiration by people all over the world - especially the people of the Soviet Union? This is not only because he was able to write, and the words he wrote were able to move people, making those who read his works follow his pen and experience joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. What is even more worthy of people's attention is his strong and unyielding will and his spirit of constantly fighting against the dark forces, with the goal of serving the people as a lifelong career.</p>
<p>Gorky was an orphan who lost his parents at a young age. He was raised by his grandmother, but his grandmother was also very poor. Therefore, in order to make a living, Gorky ran into society to make a living very early. He worked as a baker's assistant, a sailor on a ship, an apprentice to a painter, and so on. All of this was very helpful to Gorky's writing later on.</p>
<p>Gorky only spent a year or two in school. His knowledge, his broad knowledge, and his excellent writing skills were all learned in the spare time of his work, under the malicious eyes of his employers, sacrificing sleep time. He used a homemade tin can and a lamp made of cotton yarn rope to read borrowed books in front of the faint light.</p>
<p>He once wanted to go to university, but he did not succeed. In his book "My Universities," he said, "Society is his university." Then, all kinds of people were his professors. As a result of constantly learning and constantly struggling in this university of society, he finally became a writer and revolutionary. His achievements in literature can simply be described as unprecedented.</p>
<p>Little friends! We are studying quietly in comfortable schools, which is a better environment than he had. After commemorating Gorky, we should imitate his spirit of learning, strive to absorb knowledge, and our distressed country needs this group of us to build it!</p>
<h3>Plant Toys</h3>
<p>— Shepherd Boy</p>
<p>Peas as Centipedes</p>
<p>Peas are the most delicious of beans; but when they are made into centipedes, that is terrifying!</p>
<p>To make a centipede out of peas, you must prepare a needle and thread, and also many small bamboo sticks.</p>
<p>String twenty peas together with thread, arranging the larger peas at the front and gradually smaller ones towards the end. We can also connect the peas with bamboo sticks, but the centipede made that way will be smaller and more lively.</p>
<p>We know that centipedes have many legs, so we will use the small bamboo sticks as legs.</p>
<p>Centipedes have two poisonous antennae on their heads, so we also need to insert two very thin bamboo sticks into the head, and because the centipede's head is red, we must dye the first pea red.</p>
<p>The centipede has a pair of forked tails at the end, so we must insert two thick, short bamboo sticks into the last pea.</p>
<p>After you have made the centipede, don't scare your little brother into crying!</p>
<p>Eggplants as Pigs</p>
<p>You know what eggplants are, aren't there eggplants on the market recently? You certainly know what pigs are, you might even often scold other children as "pigs"!</p>
<p>Needless to say, eggplants look like the body of a pig, but they are missing legs and a tail. Most strangely, the eggplant stem is very thick, which can be used as the pig's snout; the eggplant stem has four or five petal-shaped things, which look exactly like the pig's ears.</p>
<p>In this way, we can start making a "pig".</p>
<p>First, leave a pair of same-sized petal-shaped things on the eggplant stem, which look very much like pig's ears, and then cut off a section of the eggplant stem, so that it becomes the shape of a pig's snout.</p>
<p>Four legs can be made of blackened bamboo or wooden sticks, and the tail can be made of something softer, then insert them into the appropriate positions on the eggplant.</p>
<p>After the pig is made, don't scold other children as "pigs" anymore.</p>
<h3>Common Things in Hot Weather</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>In daily life, the more common things are, the easier they are to overlook. If we can always think about them, we will certainly generate many interesting questions. However, the more interesting the questions are, the more difficult it is to come up with an answer. Even in hot weather, when talking about things that are often seen in hot weather, we tend to easily overlook them. But A-Liang's father often asked him these questions that A-Liang thought were very superficial, but in his simple and naive mind, he naturally couldn't get any clues, so he was stumped by the questions.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, the weather was really hot, even discouraging A-Liang's interest in going out to play, but his father suddenly asked him this: "What are the benefits of sweating a lot in summer? Why can a towel wipe the sweat off your forehead?" A-Liang listened, and saw that there was indeed a lot of sweat dripping from his father's forehead. When he was asking the question, he wiped the dripping sweat with a towel, and A-Liang realized the motivation behind his father's ability to come up with these two questions.</p>
<p>"Sweating a lot in summer is of course because it's hot. If the weather is not hot, I wouldn't sweat. Towels can naturally wipe off sweat, so I use it!" A-Liang thought that this question couldn't be more childish, and he was surprised that his father could think of it.</p>
<p>"Haha! Your new answer is no better than not answering at all. If you directly say you don't know, it would show your honesty. You know that your answer is half-knowledge, so I'm bringing it up today to ask you, so that it can draw your attention. Now I'll explain it to you: The climate in summer is very hot, often hotter than our body temperature, which could kill people. But when we get to summer, we sweat, so sweating is very important in hot weather. If you don't sweat, you will definitely get sick, because sweating can make the body feel cool. How does this happen? After sweating, it doesn't always stay on the body, so before long, the sweat will evaporate and turn into gas, but during evaporation, it must absorb heat. It takes the heat from the hot air around the body, otherwise the evaporation will slow down. When it takes the heat from the air, the temperature of the air decreases, and at this time the whole body feels extraordinarily comfortable and cool. The reason why towels can wipe sweat is because the texture of the towel is made of fibers. When fibers are woven into a towel, the structure is loose, forming many tiny gaps. Unfortunately, we can't see it clearly with our naked eyes, and these tiny things have the ability to absorb water, so it can wipe the sweat dry, that is, absorb the sweat into the tiny gaps in the towel. Speaking of this, I'm reminded of various questions about hot weather: In summer, we wear more white clothes, and they must be ironed very flat. When we put them on, we feel especially beautiful. But why do starched clothes become stiff after ironing? Starch is commonly used to starch clothes. Starch is rich in starch, so when ironing, after high heat, the starch is converted into solid and hard dextrin, so the clothes also become stiff. The back of the postage stamp is also made of dextrin to stick it on the envelope. When we sunbathe a lot in summer, our skin will turn black. What is the reason for this? Because there is a kind of cell in the skin that can produce melanin. After being exposed to particularly hot sunlight, it promotes the production of this melanin, so the more you sunbathe, the faster the production of melanin, so after a summer, you can become a piece of charcoal... When A-Liang's father was talking about this, A-Liang's mother called him to take a bath, interrupting him; A-Liang never dared to pretend to be smart again.</p>

<h3>Talking About The Golden Cangue</h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>"The Golden Cangue" is also "June Snow". This play is a traditional Qingyi opera. Hu Xilu, Shi Xiaofu, Chen Delin, and Wu Caixia were all known for their excellent performances in this play. Later, the four famous Dan actresses all performed it, and Cheng Yanqiu became famous for this play.</p>
<p>This play was written by Guan Hanqing of the Yuan Dynasty. The play is titled "Dou E's Injustice." It briefly states that Dou Tianzhang of Chuzhou has a daughter named Duanyun, who was given to Aunt Cai as a foster daughter when she was young. She was renamed Dou E. Two years after her marriage, Aunt Cai's son died of illness, and Dou E kept her chastity and served her mother-in-law. There was a quack doctor named Sai Luyi who owed Aunt Cai money. Aunt Cai went to collect the debt. Luyi, lacking funds to repay, led her to the suburbs and strangled her neck with a rope, intending to kill her. Zhang Luer and his father encountered them and rescued her. Aunt Cai was grateful and kept Luer's father at home. Old Zhang wanted to marry Aunt Cai, and Luer wanted to marry Dou E. Aunt Cai was about to comply with their wishes, but Dou E resisted and scolded Luer. When Aunt Cai fell ill, Dou E went to the Yulong Nunnery to pray to the gods. When praying, she dropped the golden cangue left by her husband on the ground. Zhang Luer picked it up. Dou E returned home, and Aunt Cai asked for lamb tripe soup. Zhang Luer plotted to kill Aunt Cai so that Dou E would be lonely and weak and easy to bully. He said to Dou E, "I will handle it for you." He conspired with Luyi and said that Dou E had used the golden cangue to exchange for poison, otherwise he would report her to the authorities for strangling Cai to death. Luyi was forced to agree to his request and gave him poison to take away. Luer then put the poison in the lamb tripe soup. Dou E served the soup, but her mother-in-law found the taste fishy and refused to eat it. Just then, Old Zhang returned from outside, very hungry, and took it and ate it, bleeding to death. Luer forced Dou E to marry him, but she refused. Luer complained to the authorities. The official did not investigate and condemned Dou E to death. During the execution, blood flowed upwards like white silk, and snow fell in June. After her death, there was a great drought in Chuzhou for three years. Dou Tianzhang, who was then the Lianghuai Judicial Commissioner, heard the soul of Dou E complaining of injustice. He reviewed the previous case and found out the truth. He sentenced Luer to death and also determined Luyi's crime. An anonymous person in the Qing Dynasty rewrote the story into a play called "The Golden Cangue," saying that Cai's son, Changzong, capsized while going to take the examination and entered the Dragon Palace. The Sea Dragon King married his third daughter, Xiao E, to him. Later, he reunited with Dou E and changed Dou E's sentence when she was about to be executed, and snow fell in June. When Lianghuai Judicial Commissioner Dou Tianzhang arrived in Chuzhou, he learned of the unjust case and postponed Dou E's execution and reviewed the previous case. At this time, Cai Changzong also returned to Chuzhou to find his mother. The son-in-law, mother, son, and husband and wife were reunited, but Luer escaped punishment. He escaped from prison and was struck by lightning.</p>
<p>The current Ping opera performance is slightly different from the above two versions. Zhang Luer's father is changed to Zhang's mother. Luer wants Dou E, but neither the mother-in-law nor the daughter-in-law agree. Aunt Cai is willing to comply with Luer's wishes. Luer complains to the authorities, accusing Aunt Cai of murder, causing Aunt Cai to be imprisoned. Luer also forces Dou E to marry him, which is different from the previous version. Dou E confesses to the crime on behalf of her mother-in-law, not because the official made a rash judgment. However, as performed in the Ping opera version, the title of the play "The Golden Cangue" is actually without origin, but Cheng Yanqiu and Huang Guiqiu often perform this play, often posting "The Golden Cangue" instead of writing "June Snow" or "Dou E's Injustice", which is a matter of habit.</p>

<p>Symbolizing the revolutionary heat, symbolizing the fire of light, although they are all young, they only need to work, they have lofty ideas, they are not afraid of people mocking the naivety of their work, and they are even more afraid of someone wanting to destroy and hinder them. As a result, "the fallen fall, and then one by one stand up." Now, they are moving "In the Torrent", and all the difficulties have been broken! Endured!</p>
<p>"Torrent Theatre Society" has been established for several years! However, the difficulties they have encountered are the most and the most complex. After performing more than ten famous plays in more than ten sessions, "Torrent Theatre Society" has stabilized its foundation, and everything has gotten on the right track. However, "Torrent Theatre Society" is "In the Torrent"!</p>
<p>In addition to wanting to perform "Love Letter" and "New Mei Luoxiang" and "The Turbulent Times", "The City That Never Sleeps", "The Young Drummer"...etc., they are planning a new performance, the play is titled "In the Torrent". The play has been commissioned by the author Ma Ling for compilation! It is said that "In the Torrent" is the most enthusiastic mass play, like "Ode to Righteousness" currently being performed on Lafayette, with more than a hundred people performing on stage, and there are songs and dances, with new compilations. Now, the leaders of the society, Zhao Minsun and agent Zhang Minpu, are vigorously directing the society's members in planning work. They themselves publish a small newsletter, "Torrent Theatre News", and founded a "Torrent Printing Bureau", preparing to compile scripts themselves and publish them themselves. This not only does not cause a script shortage, but also allows other small theater groups to have new scripts to perform.</p>
<p>Correction In the previous issue of this journal, "Recent Developments in the Shanghai Drama Circle", there was a statement that "Lan Lan and Han Fei of the film industry participated in guest appearances." It has been verified that Lan Lan and Han Fei are both basic actors of the Shanghai Drama Art Society and are not guest appearances. This is especially corrected.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Heroic and Valiant Come to Battle</p>
<p>When Liu Yining saw Xu Jing open the letter to read, he also stepped forward and looked at it shoulder to shoulder. This letter was written by General Zhou Yuji himself. In a few words, it was clear at a glance. Xu Jing turned his head and said to Liu Yining, "Since the bandit alarm is urgent, the general wants us to go to help defend the territory. This is an undeniable matter. Moreover, I came here to join the army and make contributions. The bandit is under the city, and it is the time for patriots to serve. I wonder what my brother thinks?" Liu Yining said, "Of course, we must follow General Zhou and work hard to kill the bandits, so as not to betray the people of the Ming Dynasty. Now, Brother Jing might as well enter the city first. After I discuss it with my aunt and get her permission, I will definitely track you down. Tell General Zhou that I, Liu, am not a coward, and I will definitely come to his command to serve. It's just that there are still some private matters to be dealt with properly on the mountain before I can come again." Xu Jing listened to Liu Yining's words. Because Liu Yining had not yet been employed and did not need to respond to the roll call, and he believed that his words were true, he packed his bags, wore the Scarlet Phoenix Sword, bid farewell to Liu Yining's aunt, and left with the official. The official gave the horse to Xu Jing to ride. Liu Yining sent him a dozen steps, stood under a large tree, and watched Xu Jing jump on the horse and say, "I wish Brother Jing works hard and presents the song of victory early. If I can come early, I will follow in your footsteps." Xu Jing also turned his head and said, "I hope my brother will come to Daizhou early to kill the bandits together." With a whip, the horse under him had already spread its hooves and ran down the mountain with a splashing sound. Xu Jing galloped all the way, thinking in his heart, Liu Yining's martial arts are very good. Now is the time to work hard for the royal family. Why is he delaying his journey? Seeing that he seemed to have other secrets, he may not be able to come out of the mountain for a while. If he never agrees to sing the same song of hatred and wields the sword to chase the bandits, wouldn't he be wasting this seven-foot body? Why is it necessary to discuss it with his aunt? Although I have sworn brotherhood with him, I know nothing about his family history. He has never told me, which is really strange. Xu Jing ran all the way and thought, the sound of the bells was clear, and before long he had reached the city of Daizhou. (90)</p>
