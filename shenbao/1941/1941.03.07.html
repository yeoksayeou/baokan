<h3 id="c4">英日的接觸 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>本月四日，英國政府又由首相邱吉爾氏延見日本駐英大使重光葵，與上次延見距八日，英日兩方久已沒有類此的接觸，這兩次晤談內容未經正式公表，即此接觸頻繁的姿態，亦夠引起各方予以注意。據所透露，日使賷致日本外相松岡洋右的函件，對英提供新保證，謂日本不擬攻擊英帝國的任何部分，幷表示德義日三國盟的係防止戰爭擴展到遠東；又說明了日本對越泰爭執，從事調停的旨趣與成就</p>
<p>日本對於自已捺了手印的國際條的尚且視如糞土，此外所提保證，所作期許，大多被他的別種言辭及行動所先後抵消；凡百言與言的矛盾，行與言的矛盾，歷年已有不少潑辣的表現。即如上月二十四，重光當然是根據了松岡的指令，正在倫敦披肝瀝膽，開誠布公，向邱吉爾陳說日本決不侵英的衷曲；即於同日，松岡却在東京向國會發表其全部大洋洲應屬亞洲人的宏願；同這一日，同這一對象，若此矛盾，這豈僅對英國，亦是對國際社會與人類文明所作放肆的諷刺與戲弄。若說不然，日本別有苦衷。不無誠意，再不必厭惡他言辭的朝三暮四；但忽倨忽恭，忽友忽敵，誰又敢信任他政策的暮四朝三？故料想英日間一而再，再而三，無論接觸如何頻繁，必因絕對沒有誠信爲之基礎而徒相委蛇，終於一無成就。</p>
<p>雖然，這在日本豈是無聊的惡作劇，亦自有其所憧憬：其一，利用他的同盟國在巴爾幹採取攻勢之機會，旣所以誘致萬難中之英國，稍稍軟化而對日本放鬆一步，以迄妥協，亦所以對他同盟國表示其呼應配合；其二，以他在越泰糾紛中所俘獲的成果，向與越泰密接的英國，在外交手法上，政治意義上，先行『立案』；其三，期待着英國頑固分子的乘機抬頭，綏靖政策的死灰復燃，示之以祇要接受日本在遠東的「和平」意願，便得拆散日本與德義之間的侵略同盟；其四，英美兩國對於遠東，經一年以來辛苦經營，始獲成就的並行政策，在日人心目中正是視之爲旣粗且重的鎯鐺鐵索，美國態度旣堅定至無可搖撼，自惟有向英國採行其和平攻勢，嘗試其麻醉政策，以謀分化英美，解脫鎖鏈。日方如此幻想，世人必深信英國不致受愚，况在此邱吉爾與艾登時代，更無受愚之理。蓋遠東侵略者旣得越南爲堦石，泰國爲橋梁，其觸鬚已及英國領屬的沿邊，其聲勢已脅英國主要的堅壘；英國雖遭逢多難，但英國所保持的力量，還足以維護其權益與威望：亦即英國的國勢所繫，在政策上並不需要斷送一切而退出遠東。且英國在此戰時，依存於美國者極厚，更不宜與美國遠東政策背道而馳，竟爾退脫英美的並行，招致超越遠東範疇以上的不幸！</p>
<p>我人無所憂慮於英國政府的政策，更不懷疑於美國政府的政策，却亦不願漠視英美政府以外的種種。據昨日電訉：美國孤立派阻撓政府的論據，美當局不但斥之爲愚蠢，且直揭其含有「毒素」；而舊金山發現的間諜案之中，很可駭的牽涉了舉世聞名的數人。美國國內旣有此類忽生忽滅的泡沫，雖曰無關大局，但我人不能不因此而促英國朝野的特別謹愼。如上月廿四，日使重光初謁邱吉爾之後，英人路透社便自倫敦散放其樂觀消息，謂『會晤頗有結果，當可大有助於兩國間某種誤會之袪除』，又謂『一般人士認此項談話或有助於遠東局勢之鬆弛』；及隔昨二次晤談，則復忻忻然傳稱『此次談話使空氣大爲澄淸』云云；這當然不是表示英人已經爲所麻醉，而將英日間的利害衝突寫在「誤會」賬上，英國所受日本威脅與侮辱放之空氣之間，而在萬難中的英國一部人，因心理感受打擊而意志削弱，遂致吃了『空心湯糰』還是感泣涕零，其情可憫。然因不謹愼的流露而使人誤認爲英國綏靖政策竟又見死灰復燃的跡象，則因遠東大局的切實支撑，繫於中國的强毅抗戰，必不受何種誤認的影響；而風聲所播，將使美國方面相當多數的人民，對於英國歷來無甚好感者，因此而强調其不信任，使孤立派更振振有辭，則必有爲英國方面所無法疎忽的後果。到那時候，殆非如倫敦電的『袪除誤會』云云，所得遽爾『鬆弛局勢』了！</p>

<h3 id="c22">歐戰痛史（七）　英法聯軍　戰爭初期的失着 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>希特勒曾經說過，「我要渙散他們的軍心。」這裏的他們，當然指英法而言。經過了整個冬天的按兵不動，希特勒在這一點已成功了。士卒冒雨挖掘壕溝，防禦他們從未看見過的敵人，已不免日久生厭。將各師團逐一調往戰塲，積極訓練，應付新式恐怖戰爭，這原是可能的事，也是應該的事。德波戰爭中的一切敎訓，都可引以爲鑑。可是我們太沒有戰爭心理了。一班將領們，都是小心翼翼，墨守成規，在平時固可稱道，在戰時就不能適合機宜了。我曾向某將領質問，何以不使他的部下習見噴火戰車和急降轟炸機呢？</p>
<p>我說，假使他們身臨前敵，第一次遇見這種怪物，必將驚惶失措。假使他們對於這種武器，業已司空見慣，必能視若無睹，即可無驚奇之感了。</p>
<p>他回答道，這話固然有理，我也曾屢次聲請，但是我獲到的反應，總不外是「戰車演習，有害農作，民政當局，堅決反對」這一類話。</p>
<p>戰綫後方，似乎沒有一個人想到敵軍攻擊的危險，人人祗談着閒散無聊的苦悶。當戰爭初起時，士卒缺乏軍毯，羊毛衫和皮靴，其後供應機關，紛粉設立，勞軍組織，猶如雨後春笋，香烟等物，膾送去絡繹不絕，於是兵士收到的包裹太多了，受領的禮物也太多了</p>
<p>一個英國兵很莊嚴地對我說，「我縱然盡心竭力，也不能把兩百枝香烟在一天內吸完呀！」</p>
<p>這時候巴黎和倫教的有名人物，已發起各種新花樣，如軍中讀物，軍中娛樂，以及軍中游戲，藝術，戲劇等等。這種無聊舉動，不覺激惱了一個婦人，竟說要預備設一「軍中戰爭」新機關呢。</p>
<p>在英軍前錢，由著名滑稽家和評論女演員組成「音樂團」，乘着軍用汽車，由軍官護送，到各處去表演。音樂大家馬立斯沙伏利爲英法兩國軍隊演唱，更使聽衆擊節，他到達阿拉斯的盛况，就是勒白倫總統到來，也不免相形减色。英法軍隊向他歡呼若在，法國兵喊，「馬立斯，來一只華倫丁」英國兵也喊，「馬立斯，來一只兩珠曲！」</p>
<p>這一切固然使人興奮，而且絲毫無害，但是要應付德國的攻勢，總不能算是有效的準備吧！英法兩國正當歷史上空前嚴重的時期，要糾正已往的錯誤，完成工事，訓練士卒，祇有短短幾個星期，兩國將士，依然醉生夢死，在官僚式軍事管理之下，度着無聊的生活</p>
<p>阿拉斯城中，有好幾千法國殖民地兵，都是遠地動員而來，久經戰陣的士卒，實際却並無所用。軍中祗派他們蒔花種菜，養家禽，飼豬兎，這雖是好整以暇，儒將雅事，但是鞏固阿拉斯和司卡巴的工事，或者更顯迫切吧！我友某軍官，大着胆子向上級將領貢獻意見，却受着一頓訓斥。</p>
<p>「鞏固司卡巴嗎？敵人決不會這樣深入的，你是個失敗主義者，且下去靜候命令！」</p>
<p>這類事經不得一兩遭，就是最熱心的軍官，也祇得奉令行事，不敢多管了。士卒因爲飽食終日，無所事事，身體都胖了起來。英國兵每當夜色一臨，便伏案作書，瑣瑣細細，寫給他們的愛妻和情人，軍官不勝檢查，祇見桌上的信封，一疊方去，一疊又來，堆得比前更高，當然不再高興去檢查了。口舌之爭，已成軍中常事。自由的前途，世界的命運，全靠他們的戰鬥力，那知他們口角不遑，反而把本份置諸腦後。希特勒有言在先，他已使我們軍心渙散了。</p>
<p>我於十二月杪，曾在馬奇諾防綫中耽擱數天，却帶回來滿懷興奮。我見了這種連綿不絕的神秘山脈，砲位林立，毒氣不侵，非但得到堅不可破的絕大印象，而且對於防守兵士，亦是欽仰備至。</p>
<p>守軍幾乎都是羅蘭人，在防區就地徵募而來。所以他們即在平時，每逢星期日也可前赴防地。我遇見不少靑年軍官，律師，工程師，他們每星期杪，在馬奇諾防綫中計算砲彈射程，已有八年之久。這種不憚煩勞，使砲火的準確，已達到了極點。砲台中瞭望員的面前，都放着照片，把戰塲劃成無數方格，上面標明數目。假使看見敵人進入某號方格，只要向電話筒中說明一聲號數，不出十秒鐘，立刻彈如雨下了</p>
<p>後來馬奇諾防錢的迅速陷落，並不是他們的過失，而是受敵包抄，方始失陷的呀。</p>

<p>現棉市况、依然呆若木雞、蓋以紗市軟弱、廠胃不振、所以人心甚挫、僅同業略有點綴而已、又棉花今有三十包、運往香港、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因棉布貿易良好、及紡織業買進、各方購意逐漸濃厚、市况亦進入活潑堅昂之狀態、結果收盤價格、較之十日高漲三至十二磅因不等、</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>（三）外幣定期儲蓄存款</p>
<p>在節的建國儲金中爲便利華僑及國人願意存外幣者的便利起見，規定可以開立外幣存軟戶。後因旅外華僑及國內商民，或以業務關係，或爲籌辦經濟事業，恒欲於國內銀行預存外幣，以備將來的應用，减少匯價波動的危險，故特擴大節建儲金外幣存款辦法，而於一九三九年十月二十七日由財部公佈外幣定期儲蓄存款辦法。規定由中·中·交·農四行辦理，而由政府特爲保障；除四行辦理外，關於法幣折合外幣儸蓄存款也可由財部核准辦理儲蓄業務的銀行呈准財部辦理，四行並予以轉存的便利，以期實惠普及人民。</p>
<p>此項存款分兩種。第一種是外幣定期儲蓄存款，得以英·美·及其他經政府核定的外幣存入，到期時照原存外幣支付本息，時期分二·三·四·五年，利率分四·五·六·七釐。第二種是法幣折合外幣定期儲蓄存款，得以法幣按照商業匯率折購外幣存人，到期時應向原存款地點的原銀行支取本息，時期分三·四·五年，利率分二釐·二釐半·三釐，不過存款額以法幣兩萬元折購爲限。</p>
<p>（四）金公債</p>
<p>黃金所有者除掉上述三項之外，尙有意向保財妙法，即是趕速購買政府的金公債。按國府自戰事發生以先，先後發行二次金公債：第一次是民國二十七年金公債，條例於一九三八年四月二十一日由國府公佈；第二次是民國二十九年建設金公債，條例於一九四〇年三月一日由國府公佈。均於公佈日施行。</p>
<p>民國二十七年金公債分三種債票：關金債票一萬萬關金，英金債票一千萬鎊，美金債票五千萬元。購買方法：（一）以關金券或生金及其製成品或金幣繳購的，除關金券按劵額外，其他按含純金量依純金六〇·一八六六公毫折合一關金，發給關金債票；（二）以英美幣匯繳購的，分別發給英美金公債；（三）以國外有價設劵按當時售得價繳購者，也以所得的英美金分別發給英美金公債；（四）以其他外幣·外匯·國外有價證券繳購的，依購債人志願按市價折合關金或英美金，發給一種或數種債票。年息五釐，每年分兩次付給。債票分十·五十·一百·一千·一萬關金五種，五·十·五十·一百·一千芙鎊五種，五·十·五十·一百·一千·五千美元六種。</p>
<p>民國二十九年建設金公債分兩種債票：英金債票一千萬鎊，美金債票五千萬元。購買方法：（一）以外幣或外匯繳購的，按所交英·美金別分別發給英美金債票：（二）以其他外幣或外匯繳購的，依購債人的意志按當時比價折合英美金分別發給債票；（三）以法幣繳購的，可依商業匯率折合英金或美金發給債票。年息五釐，每六個月付息一次。債票分五·十·五十·一百·一千英鎊五種，五·十·五十·一百·一千·五千美元六種。</p>
<p>這兩種金公債票，在還本付息時均分別以關金英金美金支付。均爲無記名式，得自由買賣抵押。凡公務上須繳納保證金時，得作爲替代品，並得爲銀行的保證準備金。</p>
<p>以上所介紹的四種投放資金辦法，儘足供資金所有者的自由選擇。假使你喜歡保有法幣，那末可以認儲節建儲余或認購節建儲券。假使你喜歡保有外幣，那末可以存儲外幣定期儲蓄存款或購買金公債，其利息的優摩，較之現在美商銀行的不給利息再收手續費，遠不可相提並論。南太平洋的戰爭尚未爆發，趁此時機選定你資金投放的安全標的，預先佈置起來，切莫猶豫不決，坐失時機。</p>
<p>上海的資金所有的人們：抓緊了時機，依照上述四種辦法中選擇你認爲最有利最便當的去實行，這才是保財的唯一妙法，儘在上海市塲上動腦筋是沒有辦法的。（完）</p>

<p>煤市騷擾　實少交易</p>
<p>煤業市塲買賣、一般投機煤商、乘機蠢動、不顧乎民生計、及社會治安、屢次抬價漁利、各類烟白煤斤市價卒被次第做高、今因國際局勢動盪不定、若輩藉口煤斤來源或將中斷、把持大宗現貨、企圖居奇、昨日煤業市塲開做後、投機煤商活躍加甚、市况至爲混亂、持貨者雖將囤貨有尠數脫手、惟價格卒較前市高起十餘元一噸、買方因價高納胃不强、一片騷擾聲、市塲秩序已不若前之良好、顧煤斤存底何嘗較前减退、昨據煤業界消息、可供本市三個月之需、並以義泰興囤貨爲最多、</p>

<p>— 徐平</p>
<p>房東家的小姑娘預備轉學，請我介紹個學校，這可爲難了我，而且她的條件又那麼苛刻，頂多只能繳半費。她的品學本來很好，因爲原來那學校增高學費，才想出這主意的。</p>
<p>我不好意思推託，於是答應她去找一個朋友去，那是我以前的同學，他是很活動的，在敎育界他是以「老馬」自居的，所以我想去轉請他，或許還有點把握。</p>
<p>他的「事務」很忙，早晚去看了兩次，都碰不到他，據他的妻子說：到學校裹去了。我問是那個學校，她也不知道；其實，這幾天什麼學校都在假期內，而且早晨夜晚學校裹也不辦公，我有點茫然。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，我再去拜訪，這才不失所望，他還沒有起來。我便以老同學的資格一直闖進他的臥室，將他從夢鄕裏拖了起來。他告訴我咋天十一點鐘才回家，所以才睏得這麼熟。</p>
<p>我問他：「跳舞的嗎？」</p>
<p>他笑迷迷的，帶着惺忪的神情：</p>
<p>「不！黃校長請客。」</p>
<p>他對於敎育很感興趣，在大學裹讀的敎育系，本來和我同時投考大學的；後來我休學了，他也曾休學了一學期，但是，目前他還在繼續着。他的人生哲學頗有些和別人奇特，他主張「活動」，活動究竟是什麼意思，我則不知道，他也沒有發揮得淸楚，大概是注重於在社會上的活動吧？他不是常對我說：「老兄，你得「活動」「活動」，保守不是辦法！」</p>
<p>我將我的來意告訴他，他欣然的答應了。</p>
<p>「這點小事情，沒有問題。」</p>
<p>我問他轉那個中學好，他說：</p>
<p>「××中學也可以，道學期我替他們介紹二十個高三的學生；或者××中學那也沒有問題，我們正在談判之中，大概也有三十來個學生好介紹給他們……」</p>
<p>我聽了他的說話，不禁咋舌不止，暗暗的贊成他，不愧是活動的份子，敎育界的老馬。</p>
<p>我問他，——下意識的：</p>
<p>「你介紹了學校是有什麼待遇？」</p>
<p>他笑了，指着牆上的西裝。</p>
<p>「老兄，你眞太戇了，沒有好的待遇我就幹了嗎？你看，那是那裏來的，還有本學期大學裹的學費？」</p>
<p>「拿拆頭嗎？不是和拿行佣一樣？」</p>
<p>『當然，老實說，我們是「跑街」，學校就等於「學店」。』</p>
<p>他就很得意告訴我：介紹給××中學二十個高三學生，四十塊錢報名費歸他收入，還有，每人學雜費和學校二八拆也得了二百多元，……」</p>
<p>「那麼這次正在談判的呢？」</p>
<p>他笑着。</p>
<p>「我有三大條件，他們都沒有答覆……」</p>
<p>「那三大條件呢？」</p>
<p>「第一，三十幾個人的報名費歸我收；</p>
<p>第二，三十幾個人的學費三七拆；</p>
<p>第三，大部份人要跳班，學藉問題他們負責，……」</p>
<p>我笑着說：</p>
<p>「第一條該沒有問題，第二條也該可以通過，因爲都是他們學校本身的問題，不難承認，恐怕第三條將推敲吧，聽說學藉本市敎育當局是派員查核的……」</p>
<p>他又笑了。</p>
<p>「第一條第三條他們都說沒有問題承認了，僅有第二條他們主張二八拆，……」</p>
<p>我覺得出乎我意料之外，我以爲我的思想太簡單，太不聰敏，事實和我想像的相反。</p>
<p>「談判成功又可收入多少呢？」</p>
<p>「那末計算起來，比那一起還要多，大概四百元總會有吧？」</p>
<p>我慶頌他：</p>
<p>「你老兄眞能幹，所謂英明幹練，當之無愧。」</p>
<p>他更高興：</p>
<p>「老兄，不愧斯文，你這事包我，也算我對他們要求的附帶條件之一吧。」</p>
<p>我握着他的手：</p>
<p>「那謝謝了，貯候好音！」</p>
<p>談了很長的時間，他洗好了臉，我將告辭，他硬拖我去吃點心，因爲是老同學，便不客氣的和他到對面的牛肉店裹吃了鍋貼才回家。</p>
<p>我是發見了奇蹟，在敎育史上該是奇蹟吧？我的心裹感到不安！</p>
<h3 id="c81">那裏去了？ <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>報載：「二個月之間到洋米一百零一萬九千餘包，可供本市四個月之民食。」</p>
<p>看一看，想一想，不禁大嘆其「那裹去了」焉！</p>
<p>說在公倉裹吧，決沒有這麼「安逸」的事。空卡車進，實卡車出，「那裹去了」，誰都「洞若觀火」</p>
<p>說在米店裏吧，夥計會回答你沒有「到貨」，於是，「賣暗盤」，一百三十隻老洋一石！</p>
<p>說在貧民家裏吧，不耍說別人，就是我寫出來也有點「難以爲情」「不好意思」……</p>
<p>那末，到底「那裹去了」呢？「猜」起來不外有兩個「去」處：</p>
<p>鈔票多的；良心黑的。（下面都有一「人」字！）</p>
<h3 id="c82">秋海棠 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鳥</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>又候了三四分鐘，一陣輕快的脚聲裹，便走進了一個淡裝素抹的少婦來。</p>
<p>她和秋海棠只彼此略略一看，便同時覺得大大的出乎意外；不過，比較上，羅湘綺的詫異還沒有秋海棠那麼厲害，因爲她早就聽哀寳藩一再誇說過秋海棠的色藝，和種種不平凡的行動了。否則，她怎麼會願意出來見他呢？可是她一瞧秋海棠那樣樸實不華的衣飾，和英俊軒昂的氣概，却也不免覺得很奇怪，幾乎不相信他是一個唱旦的紅角兒。</p>
<p>對於秋海棠，羅湘綺的舉止，相貌衣飾，簡直沒有一件是他所預料到的。闊人家的姨太太，他見過太多了，老是那麼一般狐媚似的妖氣；就像王掌櫃媳婦一類的少奶奶，儘管是好人家的女兒出身，却也多少有些輕相。而現在站在他面前的羅湘綺，却是那樣的穩重，那樣的淡雅；美固然是美到了極處，但莊嚴也莊嚴得不可再莊嚴了！</p>
<p>秋海棠見了人，向來不像一般戲子那樣的動不動打恭作揖，總是淺淺一鞠躬便算了。</p>
<p>「眞對不起，我們像道樣的冒昧的來驚擾你老人家！」事情終究是秋海棠自己的，當然應該由他先開口。「大概一切情形巳由你們這裹那一位姓季的給太太說過了，不知道太太可能給我們一些幫助嗎？」</p>
<p>秋海棠的說話裹，不但完全沒有一些市井氣，而且完全像上等人的口吻，甚至比袁鎮守使也文雅得多了。羅湘綺一聽，不覺又把平日厭惡戲子的心理，减少了許多。</p>
<p>「但不知道你們要我怎樣做？」她在一張小椅上端端正正的坐了下去，很簡單地問。</p>
<p>「太太，那些光棍是存心想詐我們老板的錢，只求你老人家給督軍大人說幾句好話，送一張片子上警察局去，我們的事就好辦了！」這次說話的是趙四，口氣便粗俗得多了。</p>
<p>湘綺的眉尖略略皺了一皺。</p>
<p>「最好請你們把所有的經過很簡括地寫一些下來，讓我拿去給胡太太商量，也許她可以給你們幫一些忙。」</p>
<p>趙四搓着一雙胖手，頓時感覺亳無辦法起來。（四八）</p>
<h3 id="c83">王老闆的算盤 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>王老闆雖然沒有身兼數職，但他却是兩家店舖的東家兼阿大，一家是五金號，一家是電料行，去年都大發利市，也正因爲大發利市，王老闆會經失眠過一個月。你一定要講我瞎說了，怎麼大發利市還會失眠呢？</p>
<p>原因是這樣的：王老闆的一家五金號祇有四萬資本，但是財神菩薩郤幫他賺了十八萬，王老關眞是又歡喜，又煩惱，歡喜的是賺了這許多，煩惱的是怕什麼所得稅過份利得稅，據一個朋友告訴他，十八萬賺頭起碼要抽去八萬過份利得稅，（盈餘在百分之六十以上的稅率是百分之五十。）這眞嚇煞了王老闆，他想無論如何終要想個妥善的辦法才好，於是東跑朋友，西走親戚，結果辦法出來了：王老闆的五金號宜告淸理。</p>
<p>你別着急，王老闆有他自己的算盤呀，他現在重新籌備好了兩家五金號，而且爲了避免去年的缺點起見，王老關把實際上五萬資本一家五金號，在帳面上和對外都說二十萬，這就是王老闆的算盤。</p>

<h3 id="c84">都市風光 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 黃新德</p>
<p>賈克奈改變作風後，應以這部「都市風光」爲最出色，「都市風光」的優點，第一是故事木身的動人，它寫大都市中三個小市民的遭際，眞是可歌可泣，而同時對於紐的這個大都市的黑暗面，也大胆、地暴露無遺。劇作者對詹姆斯賈克奈和安秀麗丹的掙扎奮鬥，顯然地予以溫熱的同情。</p>
<p>賈克奈在片裏飾一個苦吃苦做的汽車夫，爲了愛着自小相識的安秀麗丹，他變成一個職業的擊拳家，但不幸在一次錦標比賽中遭人暗算，而雙目失明：安秀麗丹喜歡跳舞，甚至爲了她的「事業」，而犧牲了愛情，這些，把都市中小市民曾遭受生活威脅而作的艱苦奮鬥，寫得十分深刻。</p>
<p>除了男女兩主角之外，還有一個賈克奈的老弟，賈克奈以節省所入，把他培植成人，而成了一個頗有前途的音樂家。片中最後一個高潮，便是賈克奈窮途潦倒，在街頭賣報，於無綫電中，聽他的老弟所奏的都市的交響樂，那動人的調子，和覜衆的掌聲，使他不禁迴想前情，而百感交集；正在這時，安秀麗丹已翩然歸來，用手在他肩上輕輕地一拍，賈克奈雖然看不見東西，但他已經知道這是誰了。</p>
<p>全劇演得最好的，自然要算男女兩主角。賈克奈把一個希望「向上攀」的小市民的心理，刻劃得十分細緻，而把那種倔强，忠厚的個性，允描摹得酣暢淋漓，安秀麗丹雖然以「唔」腔著名，而在這齣「都市風光」裹，却並不單在賣弄她的唔腔，雖因劇情的限制，沒有多大發揮的機會，但她的演技，是有相當進境的。</p>
<p>李伐克的導演，素以細膩見稱，這里最値得特別一提的，則是他强調了音樂的氣氛，以配合劇情的進展，使觀衆格外容易感動，這一點，我想凡是看過「都市風光」的，都與我有同感吧？</p>

<p>— 李雲影</p>
<p>雷喜福　爲富連成第一科大師兄，但平生未曾走運，最受歡迎者，亦僅天津一隅。前歲一度來滬獻藝，錄羽北歸。論其技藝，確有是處，即扮相欠美，嗓音不佳，現爲富社說戲，時演時輟，老境堪憐。</p>
<p>譚富英　亦係富社之高材生，扮相英俊，嗓音寬亮，高低音俱備，如「定軍山」「珠廉寨」「探母」「捉放」等一路靠把唱工戲均爲其擅長。「洪羊洞」「南天門」「淸風亭」等衰派戲，則未見佳妙，此或年事關係，惟年前應聘更新，曾數度貼演「戰太平」一劇，按斯戲近年能動者，亦無幾人。此子竟連演數次，且聞上座頗佳，惟聞富英近染驕氣，望好自爲之。</p>
<p>譚小培　嗓音俱有其父（鑫培）之剛，而欠柔，似亦無韻味。扮相嫌俗，身段欠美，曩以「摘纓會」「武家坡」「洪羊洞」等戲享名。「唱」「念」頗守繩墨。近年以富英獨立，大有以享晚年之概，即偶一粉墨登塲，亦不過所謂逢塲作戲，梨園中能享有此公之福者，實無二人。</p>
<p>王少樓　亦斌慶社之傑出人材，當坐科時，戲路頗正，多宗叔岩，後以隨硯秋南來，深得顧曲諸子歡迎，推譽備至。返平後，兼習馬腔，致邇來之唱腔流於不余不馬，殊引爲憾。</p>
<p>陳少霖　爲陳德霖之子，學余有似處。叔岩初對彼頗有期望，會親爲指正，惟腔仍多由叔岩之現任調嗓琴師朱家奎所說，如「空城計」「駡曹」「捉放」「探母」等均爲所長，惜嗓音嫌狹，倘寬音調出，當更爲動聽。即身上臉上亦均有戲，較寳森爲妥，如肯用功，地位勢將駕諸少樓之上，兼爲寳森之勁敵。</p>
<p>遲世恭　係富社最近新出之傑材，能戲頗多，文武兼擅，前曾隨吳素秋來滬，出演更新，其扮相，台風均佳，身段台步極規矩，因初出科故。至唱腔多係官中，其嗓亦病於狹，與少霖，嘯伯同。近聞又將應聘黃金，隨李世芳南來，事已宣傳頗久，相見之期或不至遠矣。</p>
<p>餘如王鳳卿，貫大元等老者已矣：即如王文源，邢威明，高博陵，范鈞宏等，因尚未來滬出演，更限於篇幅，不多詳述，本稿十二傑之排例程序，純以藝術之優良及資格而定，合併聲明如上。（完）</p>

<p>第一章　人生何處不相逢</p>
<p>許靖答道：「以我所知，代州總兵周遇吉，深諳韜略，又精武術，可以稱得英雄。」張蒼虬笑道：「有爲者亦若是，俺與足下當該自勉自勵，將來要做個英雄，燕然勒銘，峴山留碑，纔不辜負此生。」許靖聽張蒼虬談吐之間，粗莽中有俊逸氣，不像完全是個武夫，更覺驚奇。且聽他很有英雄自許之意，知是一位虬髯第二，心裹正在怙惙•張蒼虬忽又把手向後邊璧上一指道：「這是一柄寳劍吧，可吾賜給一觀？」「許靖笑道：讀書不成，學劍不成，雖有霜鋒，未免辜負了。」說罷便走去，將那寳劍摘下來，回到桌邊，颼的從劍鞘裹拔出這劍來，陡的眼前一亮，寒光森森，逼人肌膚。張蒼虬速忙立起來道：「好劍好劍！」接到他手中一看，只見劍柄上鐫着赤鳳兩字，估科必然是唐宋以前之物，不知先代那一位英雄遺傳下來的。便又問道：「足下從那裏得來這兩柄寳劍？可喜可喜！是不是傳家之寳？」許靖笑道：「我早已說過了，先父是個文人，祖先都是儒家出身，那裏有道寳劍傳下呢？」張蒼虬道：「那麼你這寳劍從何處得來的？莫非有人贈送於你？」許靖搖搖頭道：「不是的。這事是在二年之前了。記得是淸明時節吧，先父的墳墓是在這裹鄉下鄧家橋，那裹是個荒村，有一條小河環繞流着，居民是很少的，墓地却很多，是個鬼墟。我奉着老母之命，前往掃墓。本想就趕回的，誰料那天天氣十分燠熱，掃墓方畢，烏雲蓋大，在飈大起，下了一陣大雨，使我不能回家。不得已就坐在守墳鄉人的屋子中。等到雲散雨霽，天已近晚了。我一個人很覺無聊，便沽酒獨酌，和鄉人談些鄉間狀况。黃昏時吃了晚餐，正要就寢，偶然向窗外一望，夜色十分黑暗，又沒有月亮，但是東邊不遠的地方，却有一道白光上衝霄漢。我瞧見了，覺得有些奇異，便向鄉人詢問。鄉人答道：「這條白光是常時有的，已近一年，我們都瞧見。有些人以爲妖怪，有些人以爲祥瑞，尤其是在昏黑的夜間，看得最是淸楚，有時閃閃晃動，有時深淡小定。今晚更是光明，母怪許少爺奇怪了。」我又問他道：『這白光是從什麼地方發生出來的？』（五）</p>

<p>事實上，民華對「世界兒女」的工作也確乎沒有一天放鬆過，不過因爲製作態度的謹嚴，需要有許多準備工作，例如劇本的修改與翻譯，演員的挑選以及其他到多方面等工作要做，所以一向就在埋頭工作中，直到最近，這才把準備工作就緒，而定下了開拍日程。</p>
<p>「世界兒女」導演者佛萊克及其夫人，在歐洲是有着悠久歷史的名導演，大導演如威廉第德里及明星如瑪琳黛德麗等，都出其鬥下，對於導演工作之能勝任愉快，那是常然的事，所以「世界兒女」本來內定由費穆合導者，現在且因費穆工作繁忙，而專任製片主任之職，另外，則另委司馬英才擔任該片的副導演。</p>
<p>「世界兒女」開拍在即了，這應該是孤島影壇的一個喜訊，——一九四一年如果可稱之爲時裝片抬頭年，那麼打定基礎的，應該是民華的「世界兒女」和國聯的傾全體導演演員之力攝製的「家」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Consultative Assembly Holds Sixth Meeting Yesterday: Listens to Report on Grain and Commodity Prices; Weng Wenhao Reports on the Process of Stabilizing Commodity Prices; Full Attention Given to Grain Management Measures; Provisional Motion Urges Absent Councilors to Attend <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, the 6th. The sixth day of the first session of the Second National Consultative Assembly was today. In the morning, all groups except the second group held review meetings to examine proposals. The sixth plenary session of the Assembly was held at 3:00 PM. Due to the importance of the grain and commodity price issues, the discussion of proposals was suspended to hear the government's report on grain management and price stabilization. By 3:00 PM, councilors arrived one after another, and the public gallery was packed. At the third ringing of the bell, the meeting was declared open. A total of 174 members were present, including Zeng Duo and Liu Jiashu, along with more than 50 officials from various agencies. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the meeting. After the usual formalities, the minutes of the fifth meeting were read. First, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui gave an oral response to the councilors' inquiries on foreign affairs issues. After his speech, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao took the floor to report on the progress of stabilizing commodity prices. He first based his report on the commodity price index, explaining the past price changes of metals, electricity, clothing, and food. He said that the government's price stabilization methods gradually progressed from negotiation to active management, implemented in order. The measures included: (1) Assessing Prices: The local government, together with trade associations and other groups, formed a fair price committee to jointly determine prices. (2) Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation: After sending personnel to investigate, the process moved from persuasion and warnings to punishment. (3) Management of Goods: Important goods were selected, and various specialized management agencies were established to manage them separately, such as the Fuel Management Office for coal and the Agricultural and Industrial Bank for cotton yarn. (4) Fair Price Purchase and Sale: Except for goods under specialized management, which were still handled by specialized agencies, fair price purchase and sale offices were established for all daily necessities to conduct official purchases and sales, in order to stabilize prices. After the report, Lu Zuofu, Director of the National Grain Administration, reported on the management of national grain. He said that after the establishment of the Grain Administration, the military grain issue was resolved first, followed by the management of civilian food. The method was to first remove passive obstacles and then engage in active management. The convocation of the National Grain Conference was intended to finalize a good management plan. In terms of quantity, there was no fundamental problem with China's grain supply; the key was how to regulate surpluses and deficits. The principles now determined were roughly: (1) Regulating Grain: Using surplus grain areas to assist deficit areas, and using rural areas to assist urban areas. (2) Promoting the Consumption of Coarse Grains: To substitute for rice and wheat. (3) Reducing Consumption: Strictly prohibiting brewing alcohol. (4) Increasing Production. (5) Improving Water Conservancy. The implementation methods were roughly: (1) Establishing provincial, municipal, and county-level grain management organizations. (2) Implementing Grain Management: Such as holding grain reserves, delineating supply and consumption areas to regulate supply and demand, implementing partial public sales of grain, and implementing partial grain rationing based on population. (3) Managing the Grain Market: Implementing a registration system, handling grain information, organizing grain merchants, and strengthening trade associations. The entire audience listened attentively to the report, demonstrating the councilors' attention to the grain and commodity price issues. Then, Miao Qiujie, Director of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, reported on the management of salt affairs, explaining that the increase in salt prices was not due to insufficient production but to transportation difficulties and increased costs, based on production and sales figures from the rear. In the future, the remedial measures would be to strengthen transportation organizations, implement official collection, official transport, and official sales, and to distribute evenly and standardize prices, in order to stabilize prices, and so on. After the report, it was nearly 6:00 PM. Councilors raised many questions about the issuance of fair-priced rice to civil servants and the failure to smoothly implement the new salt law. Directors Lu and Miao indicated that they would respond in writing without further discussion. Wang Yunwu and others made a provisional motion, requesting that the Assembly express its opinion on the failure of Councilors Mao Zedong and Dong Biwu to attend the Assembly. It was unanimously passed. The sixth meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM in a lively and tense atmosphere. Due to the lateness of the hour, the Chairman made a provisional decision to change the reports on the cotton yarn management situation of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the fuel management situation of the Fuel Management Office, and the handling of fair price purchases and sales by the Fair Price Purchase and Sales Office to the meeting of the Commodity Price Issue Review Committee to be held in the evening. The resolution of the Assembly regarding the failure of Councilors Mao Zedong and Dong Biwu to attend the Assembly is published below in its original form: (1) After reading the telegram from Councilors Mao Zedong and six others to the Secretariat requesting deletion, the letter from Councilors Dong Biwu and one other to the Secretariat on the 2nd of this month, and listening to the Secretariat's report on the matter, this Assembly deeply regrets that Councilors Mao, Dong, and others have not accepted the advice of some councilors of this Assembly and the former Speaker of this Assembly to attend this session. This Assembly is a national consultative body, and legally and logically, it cannot accept attendance conditions for any councilor or require the government to accept their attendance conditions, as this would set a bad precedent for this Assembly. (2) After listening to the government's various reports in recent days, this Assembly deeply feels that the government's intention to safeguard national unity is extremely sincere. All issues, except those related to military orders and military discipline, can be submitted to this Assembly for discussion under the principle of complying with the Anti-Japanese National Reconstruction Program, and the decisions of this Assembly can be used to promote the government's implementation. Therefore, this Assembly still earnestly hopes that the Communist Party councilors, under the mission of this Assembly to unite the nation in the anti-Japanese national reconstruction, will adhere to the Communist Party's declaration in September 1937 to support unification, attend this Assembly, so that all political issues can be resolved perfectly through proper channels, and the future of anti-Japanese national reconstruction will be deeply benefited.

<p>Passed Telegrams of Condolences to Generals and Soldiers and Notifications</p>
<p>Chongqing. The National Consultative Assembly yesterday passed telegrams of condolences to Chairman Chiang and the generals and soldiers at the front, and telegrams of condolences to the compatriots in the war zones and the four northeastern provinces. The telegram of condolences to Chairman Chiang praised the wisdom and bravery of the Supreme Commander and the generals and soldiers at the front, which has made the Japanese army increasingly decadent and victory is in sight. It is hoped that they will continue their efforts and complete their mission. The telegram of condolences to the compatriots in the war zones and the four northeastern provinces expressed deep concern for the compatriots and encouraged them to persevere and struggle together to complete the great cause.

<p>National Consultative Assembly Resolves to Urge the Communist Party to Attend</p>
<p>Chongqing. The National Consultative Assembly unanimously resolved tonight to invite Communist Party members to participate in this session. The passage of this resolution was due to the fact that the National Consultative Assembly, after listening to the government's report, believed that the government was willing to engage in open and honest discussions on all issues that did not conflict with military order, discipline, and the national reconstruction process. (Dispatch from United Press on the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to responsible sources, several Communist Party councilors in this session of the National Consultative Assembly had previously proposed several conditions that the government could not accept, such as requiring the army to have independence. Not only were they opposed by the Kuomintang councilors, but also by the non-partisan councilors, who were greatly disgusted. They all expressed dissatisfaction with the councilors who threatened not to attend the Assembly because their conditions had not been met and who could not gain the support of a majority of the councilors at the Assembly. The Tibetan councilor, Xixiao Jiacuo, made a speech, saying that the Communist Party's past declarations to support the government and the national anti-Japanese policy, and to abandon the policy of riots, were all very pleasant to hear. Now they have suddenly taken the opposite action. At this time when victory is in sight and all ethnic groups in the border areas are uniting to resist foreign aggression, they are willing to undermine unity and betray the war effort. It is unknown what their intentions are. Wang Yunwu said, "I am a non-partisan person, but the Communist Party's proposal of conditions for attendance is an example that must never be set. If anyone gathers a few people, they can blackmail. What will become of the system?" Other councilors also stated that the Communist Party councilors disregarded the overall situation, did not understand the big picture, and took advantage of this united meeting to give others an opportunity. Although this kind of local problem is not enough to cause a serious impact on the future of the anti-Japanese national reconstruction, it is extremely inappropriate for it to come from the actions of the councilors, and they also demanded that it be punished. However, several representatives of the independent faction were willing to mediate and provide opinions. Chairman Chiang expressed his agreement with this, and the prospect of a satisfactory resolution has now turned from cloudy to clear. (Dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Kwong Bing Shun, a councilor representing overseas Chinese in the Americas, was invited by Chairman Chiang this afternoon to a luncheon at the Chairman's official residence. More than ten people were present, including Wang Yunwu and Chen Guangfu. The conversation was very pleasant. Kwong, representing the United Overseas Chinese Association for National Salvation, paid his respects to the Chairman and his wife, and immediately donated 100,000 yuan. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Central Daily News recently published an article calling on the Kuomintang and Communist parties to immediately eliminate friction. The newspaper said that the failure of France in the end and the collapse of the Song and Ming dynasties in ancient times were all caused by party strife. The newspaper also pointed out that modern American Republicans, such as Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and even Republican presidential candidate Wilkie, have all cooperated with the Democratic administration. This is a good example for China to emulate. This example tells China that the two parties should cooperate with each other and fight for national freedom. The newspaper also called on the leaders of the two parties to find a way to resolve their disputes during the National Consultative Assembly. (Dispatch from United Press on the 6th)</p>
<p>Boxer Indemnity Should Be Stopped Immediately</p>
<p>Chongqing. The National Consultative Assembly voted yesterday to recommend to the government to abolish all Boxer Indemnity committees and to stop paying the Boxer Indemnity. If the government adopts this recommendation, stopping the payment of the Boxer Indemnity will have little financial impact on foreign countries, because most of the countries receiving the indemnity have long given up their claims or returned the indemnity to the Chinese government for specific cultural and educational purposes.

<h3 id="e4">Anglo-Japanese Contact <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>On the 4th of this month, British Prime Minister Churchill again received Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu. This was eight days after the previous reception. The British and Japanese sides have not had similar contacts for a long time. The contents of these two meetings have not been officially released, but the frequent nature of these contacts is enough to draw attention from all parties. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador brought a letter from Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, providing new assurances to Britain, stating that Japan does not intend to attack any part of the British Empire, and stating that the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is to prevent the war from spreading to the Far East. It also explained the purpose and achievements of Japan's mediation of the Vietnam-Thailand dispute.</p>
<p>Japan treats international agreements to which it has affixed its seal as if they were dirt. The assurances and expectations it makes are often offset by its other words and actions. There have been many blatant contradictions between words and words, and between actions and words over the years. For example, on the 24th of last month, Shigemitsu, of course, acted on Matsuoka's instructions and was in London, pouring out his heart and speaking openly to Churchill, explaining that Japan would never invade Britain. On the same day, Matsuoka was in Tokyo, announcing to the Diet his grand vision that all of Oceania should belong to Asians. Such contradictions on the same day and to the same target are not only a blatant satire and mockery of Britain, but also of international society and human civilization. If it is said that Japan has its own difficulties and is sincere, there is no need to be disgusted by its fickle words. But who dares to trust its policies that are alternately arrogant and respectful, alternately friendly and hostile? Therefore, it is expected that the British and Japanese sides, no matter how frequent their contacts, will only engage in futile maneuvering because there is absolutely no foundation of sincerity, and will ultimately achieve nothing.</p>
<p>However, this is by no means a boring prank in Japan, and it has its own aspirations: First, it takes advantage of the opportunity of its allies launching an offensive in the Balkans to induce Britain, which is in dire straits, to soften slightly and relax its stance on Japan, to the point of compromise, and to show its allies that it is echoing and coordinating. Second, it takes the results it has captured in the Vietnam-Thailand dispute to first "file a case" in diplomatic tactics and political significance with Britain, which is closely connected with Vietnam and Thailand. Third, it expects the stubborn elements in Britain to take the opportunity to raise their heads and for the appeasement policy to revive, showing them that as long as they accept Japan's desire for "peace" in the Far East, they can break up the aggressive alliance between Japan and Germany and Italy. Fourth, the parallel policy of the United States and Britain towards the Far East, which has been painstakingly managed for the past year, is seen by the Japanese as a crude and heavy iron chain. Since the attitude of the United States is so firm that it cannot be shaken, it can only adopt its peace offensive towards Britain, try its anesthesia policy, in order to divide the United States and Britain and break free from the chains. The world must firmly believe that Britain will not be fooled by such illusions on the Japanese side, especially in this era of Churchill and Eden. After all, the Far Eastern aggressor has already obtained Vietnam as a stepping stone and Thailand as a bridge, and its tentacles have reached the British territories along the border, and its momentum has threatened the main British strongholds. Although Britain has encountered many difficulties, the strength that Britain maintains is still sufficient to safeguard its rights and interests and its prestige: that is, the destiny of Britain depends on its policy of not needing to abandon everything and withdraw from the Far East. Moreover, Britain is heavily dependent on the United States in this wartime, and it is even more inappropriate to deviate from the United States' Far Eastern policy, and to withdraw from the parallelism of Britain and the United States, resulting in misfortunes beyond the scope of the Far East!</p>
<p>We have no worries about the policies of the British government, and we do not doubt the policies of the American government, but we also do not want to ignore all kinds of things outside the British and American governments. According to yesterday's telegram, the American authorities not only denounced the arguments of the isolationists who are obstructing the government as stupid, but also directly revealed that they contain "poison." And in the espionage case discovered in San Francisco, it is very shocking that it involves several world-famous people. There are such bubbles that suddenly appear and disappear in the United States, and although it is said that they are not related to the overall situation, we cannot help but urge the British to be particularly cautious. For example, on the 24th of last month, after Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu first met with Churchill, Reuters of Britain disseminated its optimistic news from London, saying that "the meeting was quite fruitful and could greatly help to remove some misunderstandings between the two countries," and also said that "the general public believes that this conversation may help to relax the situation in the Far East." And after the second meeting the day before yesterday, they happily announced that "this conversation has greatly cleared the air." This is certainly not to say that the British have been anesthetized and have written the conflict of interest between Britain and Japan on the "misunderstanding" account, and that the Japanese threat and insult to Britain have been put into the air. In a part of Britain in dire straits, the psychological impact of the blows has weakened their will, resulting in eating a "hollow dumpling" and still being moved to tears. Their situation is pitiful. However, the careless revelation makes people mistakenly believe that the British appeasement policy has seen a revival of death ash, because the solid support of the Far Eastern situation depends on China's strong anti-Japanese resistance, and will not be affected by any misunderstanding. And the dissemination of the news will cause a considerable number of people in the United States who have never had much affection for Britain to emphasize their distrust, making the isolationists more vocal, which will have consequences that the British cannot neglect. By that time, it will not be like the "removal of misunderstandings" in the London telegram, and the "relaxation of the situation" will be achieved!</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts All Consultative Assembly Members at the Jialing Guesthouse; Earnestly Delivers Instructions, Hoping for Heartfelt Cooperation; Leads All Sectors to Uphold the Belief in Certain Victory <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. At 7:00 PM on the 5th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted all the councilors at the Jialing Guesthouse, and invited government officials to accompany them. There were more than 300 guests, a rare grand occasion in the recent days in the capital. During the meeting, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, the main points of which are recorded below. Chairman Chiang first narrated the situation in the six months since the adjournment of the previous session of the Consultative Assembly in April last year, calling it the most difficult and dangerous period since the anti-Japanese national reconstruction. Since the spring of last year, there had been drastic changes in the European war, with Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium falling one after another. In June, France was defeated, which was a major change. And the Yunnan-Vietnam transportation route was subsequently blocked, and our country was adversely affected. Before long, the Yunnan-Burma Road transportation route was also blocked, which also affected the rear transportation. During this time, most observers in various friendly countries held a pessimistic view of our country. This period was very difficult, but our country never wavered in its confidence in victory, because all the evolution of the difficulties was expected in advance. Chairman Chiang then recounted the international changes since last winter, which were beneficial to us, and talked about the present. Of course, there are still many concerns today. It is natural for patriots to study the country's affairs from the points of concern. However, I would like to report to you, based on the facts I know and my fundamental views, that the points commonly cited as worrying are not worrying. In terms of economy, everyone should know an important fact: China has resisted the Japanese for four years, and the legal tender can still ensure 60% cash reserves. I dare say that no other country can do this. As for the issues of commodity prices and food, I have always believed that it is due to the incompleteness of personnel matters, and China does not lack food, so it is not a question of having or not having. In short, China will never be like Germany during the First World War, unable to fight due to lack of food. This kind of situation will never happen in China. Secondly, in diplomacy, for example, some people are concerned about the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, or between the United States, Britain, and Japan. The diplomatic issues of these countries are only known to those countries themselves, and of course we cannot know everything. But there is one fundamental view that I want everyone to pay attention to, that is, neither the Soviet Union nor the United States and Britain will hinder China's anti-Japanese national reconstruction, and they will definitely help China's anti-Japanese national reconstruction. In the past, some people may have hoped that the Soviet Union or the United States would join the war to help China, but I don't think so. China has the power to win the final victory independently, and does not need friendly countries to join the war, but only needs them to remain neutral. In this way, both sides will benefit. If China fails in the anti-Japanese national reconstruction, then their neutrality cannot be maintained and they will approach the war. Therefore, friendly countries must help China, and they will not truly compromise with Japan. Therefore, there is no need to worry about anything in diplomacy. What I call the recent international changes being beneficial is not to say that we are optimistic because friendly countries provide material assistance, but rather that China itself has this power to be self-reliant. In addition, Chairman Chiang also talked about the transportation issue, saying that the Japanese can never blockade China. In the final conclusion, he earnestly hoped that all the councilors would work together with one heart and lead all sectors of the country to uphold the belief in certain victory. At the same time, from now on, we should pay special attention to how to build China into a good country after the war, to implement constitutional government, and to complete democratic politics. Chairman Chiang spoke about this point repeatedly. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Invasion of Beihai Is Inexplicable; Roads and Transportation Have All Been Destroyed by the Chinese Army; Japanese Occupation of Beihai Cannot Be Used as a Base; Single Mouth Area Is in a State of Chaos <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. The motive for Japan's occupation of Beihai remains inscrutable. All roads leading to Beihai have been systematically destroyed by the Chinese army. The port is no longer a port for escaping the Japanese blockade. It is too poor to use the port as a naval base for Japan's southward expansion. If the Japanese intend to establish a base in preparation for a large-scale military operation against Guangxi in South China, then why did the Japanese retreat from Nanning and Qinzhou? It is very puzzling. Chinese sources say that only a small team of Japanese troops landed in Beihai to collect food and salt for transportation elsewhere, and some salt fields have been destroyed by the Japanese. A Chinese military spokesman said this afternoon that the purpose of the Japanese occupation of Beihai is to curb smuggling through Guangzhou Bay. The Japanese have also landed at various locations along the southern coast of Guangdong Province, including Dingbai and Taishan (both belonging to Zexiang). External observers also expressed their opinions, believing that the new Japanese activities have nothing to do with the southward advance or the attack on Kunming. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Japanese troops who invaded westward along the Xin Jing Road were ambushed by the Chinese army in Siqian this afternoon, suffering heavy casualties. After being defeated, the Japanese urgently increased reinforcements from Jiangmen, attempting to take risks and invade with the help of naval and air forces. The Chinese army intercepted them in separate groups and inflicted heavy damage. By 2:00 PM, the Shanzuikou area under the jurisdiction of Kaiping was in a state of chaos. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. A Chinese military spokesman announced today that 4,000 Japanese troops, under the cover of naval artillery fire and aircraft bombing, landed in eight places along the western coast of Guangdong on Monday morning, occupying six inland shipping centers. There were very few Chinese troops where the Japanese landed, so there was not much resistance. The Japanese tried to occupy Hepu, a major highway hub fifty miles north of Beihai, but were defeated by the Chinese army, and Taishan was only lost yesterday. These two places are the eastern and western ends of the new blockade line. Fierce battles are only taking place in these two courtyards. The purpose of the Japanese attack is clearly to tighten the blockade of Free China, because the Japanese have realized that they cannot overcome the Chinese army in the mountainous areas of southwestern China, because the mountain roads are rugged and mechanized teams and artillery teams cannot use their skills. The spokesman also mentioned Chairman Chiang's speech, saying that the purpose of Japan's southward advance is to attack China's supply lines in the southwest and destroy China. The spokesman also announced that the Japanese army has established a military administration in Beihai, taking over all government functions, and will implement the registration of the area's Chinese and foreign population. (Dispatch from United Press on the 6th)</p>

<p>London - Colonel Cranwell Humphrey, speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, stated that both countries are currently building a huge number of new submarines. These submarines pose a serious threat to England. It is reported that these new submarines are very small, have a high speed, and their equipment only includes the essential machinery of a typical submarine. The crew consists of only one-third of the personnel used by ordinary submarines. Cranwell continued, saying that these submarines have practically no safety equipment, as they are only intended to reach the English coast and not return to their base. If the enemy can produce a sufficient number of these weapons, it will be a serious threat to England. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Alexander Reviews Naval Warfare</p>
<p>London - Naval Secretary Alexander, in a speech last night, reviewed the progress of naval warfare, saying that the tonnage of British ships destroyed by the enemy has now been replenished by more than two-thirds. This replenishment is due to the fact that England, in addition to building new ships and acquiring ships from overseas, has also captured some enemy ships. In the past eleven weeks, the loss of ships of Britain, its allies, and neutral countries has decreased to an average of 51,000 tons per week, whereas during last summer and autumn, the loss was 90,000 tons per week. The enemy's ships sunk, captured, or scuttled total over two million tons, and over one million tons are currently stranded in neutral ports. Admirals Cunningham and Somerville, with a smaller fleet than the enemy, not only prevented the Italian fleet from running rampant in the Mediterranean but also kept them from operating in what they claim is their inner sea. Despite the strong winter winds, the British fleet continues to escort ships, knowing only where their duty lies, regardless of the climate. Judging from the enemy's communiqués, our losses are more than double the number of our battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers, and submarine losses are also greater than the number we possess. In reality, the fleet we had in August 1939 remains intact. As for the number of enemy ships lost, our announcements are very reliable. The various British warships, especially destroyers, currently in service at sea or preparing to go to sea, are more numerous than at any time since the start of the war. Although British dockworkers have been subjected to enemy bombing, they are still working hard to maintain the production of new ships. The British shipbuilding program is now mature and bearing fruit. The Royal Navy's air wing has also become a potent offensive weapon, having destroyed one enemy battleship, one cruiser, three destroyers, four submarines, and four other warships, and fifteen supply ships in this war. In addition, we have damaged two enemy battleships, two cruisers, four destroyers, four other warships, and twenty transport or supply ships. British submarines, in addition to disrupting enemy sea lanes, have destroyed no fewer than a hundred enemy ships and supply ships. In the future, the enemy may continue to use mines, raiders, aircraft, submarines, and torpedo boats to inflict significant blows on Britain, and we must be prepared for this. We have now invented a new method to counter long-range aircraft attacks, but its nature is not yet convenient to disclose. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Saigon - Two French submarines and one grain transport ship arrived here from Madagascar today, further strengthening the Vietnamese defense forces. Recently, a French mail ship transported troops from Madagascar to this area. At the same time, Saigon continued to hold air defense drills today. It is reported that Thailand is also stockpiling a large number of munitions supplied by Japan. An authoritative neutral foreign source said that in the past month of April, at least 60,000 tons of munitions were shipped from Japan to Thailand, and a large number of these military supplies are still being shipped into Thailand. Japanese military authorities do not acknowledge that Japan is supplying munitions to Thailand, claiming that Thailand has no munitions factories. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - Bangkok's official Japanese radio station broadcast this morning that, according to unofficial sources, the Thai representative at the Tokyo talks has accepted the French reservation on the Japanese mediation proposal, and the conference will end today. However, if the French do not accept Japan's solution to the border dispute, the Thai army is prepared to continue fighting. The radio also stated that the Vietnamese government is no longer able to exercise power in Vietnam, and therefore Vietnam has been freed from French rule. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Semi-official Japanese sources said that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe has decided to convene an emergency cabinet meeting today because France has not yet responded to Japan's compromise solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute as of last night. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Local officials recently announced that the provisional armistice agreement between Vietnam and Thailand, originally due to expire at noon tomorrow, has now been extended indefinitely. Although the details are not yet known, it is reported that both sides have stipulated that if they wish to terminate the agreement, it will take effect after a certain number of days after issuing a notification. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Officials said that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire deadline, which expires at noon on Friday, may be extended by Japan. Recent reports from Tokyo indicate that negotiations between French Ambassador Henri and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka have not yet been completed and will continue today. Unofficial French sources said that the French government is very willing to establish a demilitarized zone in the area after Vietnam cedes land to Thailand, so that Thailand cannot station troops or build fortresses. According to reports from Tokyo, Japan opposes the extension of the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Well-informed sources here recently stated that the negotiations between the French and Thai representatives in Tokyo are progressing towards a peaceful resolution, and the position taken by the French side is conducive to Japan's mediation efforts. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese intelligence reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka met with French Ambassador Henri today to discuss some points beyond what the Thai and Vietnamese governments have already agreed upon. This meeting was held after the intelligence department announced that France and Vietnam had reached a fundamental understanding on the Japanese mediation plan. The intelligence department stated today that representatives from Japan, Thailand, and France had issued a joint communiqué, announcing that the three parties had agreed on the main points of the Japanese mediation plan, and other details could be resolved later. However, the content of the agreed-upon proposals was not announced. Before issuing this communiqué, the intelligence department also announced that the French ambassador and the Japanese foreign minister had held a 55-minute meeting on the mediation issue. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - After three meetings between Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and French Ambassador to Japan Henri, the Cabinet Information Bureau announced tonight that negotiations on some points regarding the resolution of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute have made progress. Matsuoka and Henri met three times today, twice after the French and Thai representatives reached a basic agreement on the Japanese mediation proposal. This evening, Matsuoka visited Henri to discuss points not included in the conditions already agreed upon by the French and Thai governments. The two met again tonight to discuss the details of resolving the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, and negotiations have made progress. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources, as of last night, France had not yet responded to Japan's proposed solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, so the situation is quite delicate and serious. Saito, Director of the South Seas Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Secretary-General of the Japanese Mediation Conference, visited French Ambassador Henri yesterday, pointing out that if France delays in responding to Japan's proposal, the situation will become serious, so he asked France to respond as soon as possible. The Japanese government does not want a third extension of the ceasefire deadline, and if forced, the Japanese government will take strong measures to deal with everything. However, if France's answer can be received today, an agreement can be reached. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington - It was declared here yesterday that respect for national sovereignty, equal opportunity, and adherence to treaties are the foundations of the United States' Far East policy. This statement was a reaffirmation of the United States' Far East policy by Secretary of State Hull and was clarified by a State Department spokesman. Wilton, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department, read Secretary of State Hull's statement at a meeting of a lecture conference in this city, stating: "Regarding relations in the Far East and elsewhere, the United States has two main objectives: the protection and development of the United States' legitimate interests, based on respect for the legitimate interests of other countries and the promotion of international peace and mutual assistance. In seeking to achieve these objectives, the United States advocates equal opportunity, respect for national sovereignty, and adherence to treaties as the basis for a true and lasting international order." (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - People here expect that the talks held in London on March 4 between British Prime Minister Churchill and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, if heeded by Tokyo hardliners, could be more effective than any recent event in reducing tension in the Pacific. It is learned here that Churchill took the opportunity of the talks to thoroughly explain Britain's position in the Far East and its intention to defend its territory and interests. It is reported that Shigemitsu stated that Japan does not want the war to expand to the Pacific and will not threaten British interests. Whether or not this statement by the Japanese ambassador is true, he is certainly aware of the consequences of threatening British interests, and it is beyond doubt that Britain will determine what these interests are and when they can be considered threatened. In other words, Japan is the one who will decide by any action whether the war will extend to the Pacific. According to a commentator here, the US government was fully informed of the situation of the London talks. Although this has not been confirmed, it is credible. The US government deeply approves of what Britain has done. As for the claim that Britain has somewhat allowed Japan a free hand in Vietnam, some well-informed observers are doubtful about this. Now that Vichy and Thailand have accepted Japan's mediation, it is inconvenient for others to interfere with its solution. However, if Japan wants to take advantage of this situation to deeply entrench its influence in Vietnam, then the Prime Minister's statement that Britain must be the judge of its own interests is a direct challenge. However, how far Japan wants to go is up to Japan to decide. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Singapore - Joint exercises by Malayan troops and civil defense forces began yesterday. It is believed that the exercises will simulate the actual situation when war is approaching Malaya or occurring in Malaya. The preliminary stage of the exercises will continue until Saturday. In the first stage of the exercises, the navy, army, and air force will practice the situation of a strong enemy pressing the border and war breaking out. The second stage of the exercises is more important and will simulate the situation when war has actually broken out in Malaya. The exercises will be commanded by Major General Dewey, Chief of Staff, so that General Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, can serve as Commander-in-Chief in the exercises. Lieutenant General Liddell, Commander of the China Base, will work closely with Major General Dewey. Australian troops are also participating in the exercises. Civil defense has been practicing for a week, blackouts have been implemented, and various government civil departments are also simulating wartime conditions. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington - The Senate took its first legislative action on the Lend-Lease Act yesterday, passing several amendments and engaging in fierce debate on the amendment of Senator Allen. Observers believe that Senator Allen's amendment will be seen by Tokyo as an indication that the United States will not resist Japan's southward advance in the Pacific, as the amendment prohibits the dispatch of U.S. troops outside the Western Hemisphere, including the Philippine Islands. As for the amendments passed by the Senate yesterday, they are listed below: (1) Both houses can abolish the powers obtained by the President under the Lend-Lease Act by a majority vote, and this vote does not require the President's consent. (2) Limiting expenses, authorizing the President to supply foreign military needs at present and in the future, not to exceed $1,300,000,000. Further assistance to Britain and other democratic countries must be specially approved by Congress. (3) Authorizing the Secretaries of the Navy and Army to stipulate the value of leased and donated equipment. (4) Stop the transfer of funds from the Navy and Army until June 30, 1946. (5) Without special congressional approval, future congressional budgets for the Navy and Army shall not be used for aid to Britain. (6) Passed an addendum stipulating that if any inappropriate regulations are found in the regulations that have been passed, other regulations will not be affected. As for Senator Allen's amendment, it is still under fierce debate. Allen claimed that he has obtained the support of 56 senators, but observers believe that the government will eventually defeat this proposal. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Vichy - Cabinet Minister Admiral Darlan continued talks with French dignitaries and German authorities in Paris today. He is expected to return here tomorrow morning or afternoon. The main purpose of Darlan's trip is to maintain contact between the administrative agencies in the occupied and free zones of France. Darlan also discussed several important economic issues with the German authorities, especially the wheat issue. The areas where France produces wheat are all in the occupied zone, and the amount of wheat currently stored in the free zone is very small. Although the authorities have again restricted consumption, it is extremely difficult to maintain it until the autumn harvest, so this food problem is quite serious. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>London – According to news from here today, it is rumored that German troops are near Adrianople, less than fifteen miles from the Turkish border. The Balkan situation has now entered its second stage. It is said that the first stage may have concluded yesterday with the severing of relations between Britain and Bulgaria, and the successful conclusion of important talks between the British Foreign Secretary, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Dill, and Turkish and Greek leaders. Currently, two important facts are quite clear: (1) The entry of German troops into Bulgaria not only threatens British forces in the Near East, but also Britain's allies, Greece and Turkey; (2) The German side is evidently disconcerted by Britain's recent activities in the Balkans. Yesterday, Moscow Radio again broadcast the Soviet government's official statement condemning Bulgaria's policy, broadcasting it for the third consecutive night. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German troops entering Bulgaria have, in reality, largely approached the Turkish border, but the official spokesperson refuses to confirm this news. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Istanbul – The major newspapers here are expressing great satisfaction with the Soviet Union's undisguised expression of dissatisfaction with the German occupation of Bulgaria. The newspaper "Dan" reports that the Soviet Union has poured cold water on Germany and Bulgaria. The newspaper "Ikdam" states that the Soviet Union, in very strong language, expressed great indignation about the arrival of German troops in an area considered to be within the Soviet Union's security zone, and only 7,000 miles from the Tatar-Nile region. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>Sofia – The British government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Bulgaria was officially notified to the Bulgarian government yesterday. The British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, visited the Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov yesterday morning to inform him of the British government's decision and request exit visas. Minister Rendel and embassy staff will leave Bulgaria within a few days. The Dutch, Belgian, and Polish embassies will also leave Bulgaria together when the Bulgarian government indicates that their mission in Bulgaria has now ended. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>Sofia – The British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, received his exit visa from the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry yesterday. British-Bulgarian relations have therefore been severed. The British Minister and all his staff have been ordered to return to London immediately, and will travel to Istanbul no later than Monday or Tuesday. Rendel stated that after his meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov, he deeply felt that Filov firmly believed that final victory would belong to Germany. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London – The British Minister to Bulgaria, in a note to the Bulgarian government regarding the entry of German troops into Bulgaria, stated that the British government believes that the Bulgarian government does not wish to maintain neutrality in the current war situation and is prepared to actively cooperate with Germany. While the Bulgarian government is free to take any steps to protect its national interests and defend against real or imagined external threats, this is no concern of the British government. However, Britain is currently at war with Germany, and with the appearance of a large German army in Bulgaria, coupled with the Bulgarian government's tendency to obey German policies, the British government believes that this is incompatible with the maintenance of British-Bulgarian diplomatic relations. As for Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov's claim that the German government stated that the presence of German troops in Bulgaria is temporary and aimed at safeguarding peace, it should be known that Bulgaria has never been threatened or disturbed by any country outside the Axis powers, so the German government's statement is specious and aims to conceal its aggressive intentions using its usual tactics. Regarding the nature of German military actions in Bulgaria, Germany's aim is to threaten Greece, a friend of Britain, and attack it if necessary. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>London – The British Board of Trade announced today that the Trading with the Enemy Act will now apply to Bulgaria. Anyone engaging in commercial, financial, or other dealings with any people in Bulgaria will be punished according to law. The Ministry of Economic Warfare also issued a notice stating that the British government has decided to recognize Bulgaria as enemy-occupied territory. From yesterday onwards, Bulgaria has been regarded as enemy territory to which contraband is not permitted. All goods produced or owned by Bulgaria may be confiscated from now on. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>Official Announcement from Athens: British and Greek Opinions Identical</p>
<p>Athens – After the visit of British Foreign Secretary Eden to Athens, an official communiqué was issued, announcing that the governments of Britain and Greece hold completely identical views on all aspects of the Balkan Peninsula situation. It also stated that Eden and Dill arrived in Athens on March 2 for a formal visit, and were received by the King of Greece and the Chairman of the Administrative Council, with whom they held lengthy discussions. Eden reiterated the Greek government and people's deep gratitude for the valuable assistance provided by Britain. Eden declared that he and General Dill were deeply moved by the warm welcome and greatly impressed by the magnificent war record of the Greek people in responding with force to America's barbaric attacks. The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom is courage. 2,300 years ago, Athens was renowned for its courage. Today, the Greek people are giving new life to this great tradition. The British Navy and Air Force are proud to have contributed to the glorious victories achieved by the Greek army. The future may be difficult, but we will not rest or waver until final victory is achieved. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>London – Athens Radio stated that General Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, visited the headquarters of the Greek army in Athens yesterday, and also met with King George of Greece. (Reuter, 6th)</p>

<p>British Troops Land in Greece; Eight Bulgarian Cities Mobilized</p>
<p>Rome – Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, stated yesterday that a division of Canadian troops has landed in Thessaloniki. The "Roman People's Daily" recently reported that a strong British army is concentrating in Palestine on the border with Syria. The newspaper also claimed that British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Ankara aimed to persuade Turkey to attack Syria, but was rejected by Turkey. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest – Confirmed news: Eight major cities in Bulgaria, including Sofia, have declared mobilization in accordance with the civil mobilization law. Men aged sixteen to forty and women aged twenty to fifty are all included in the mobilization. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuter correspondent in Sofia has just telegraphed from the Bulgarian capital, stating that German troops are passing through Bulgaria by train, truck, car, and plane, heading towards the Greek border in an endless stream. Mechanized units stretch for several miles on the three major roads heading south. Villagers watch the passing German troops in silence, with worried expressions, knowing that with the entry of German troops into Bulgaria to the west, war is approaching within the country and food will become scarce. At least five divisions of the German 17th Division stationed across the Danube have entered Bulgaria. German Junkers aircraft are continuously carrying military equipment south, while Messerschmitt German aircraft are gradually gathering at newly built bases in southern Bulgaria. With the severance of British-Bulgarian relations yesterday, the bleakness caused by the entry of German troops has increased. German police are now stationed in various towns in the countryside, directing mechanized transport teams heading south. Last night, when the reporter boarded a train at the Sofia train station heading south, he saw German railway personnel entering and exiting the station, looking very busy. The reporter saw sandbags piled up outside various government offices in Sofia. The general public in Bulgaria are indignant and dissatisfied with the German occupation of Bulgaria, and are not fooled by German propaganda. The Soviet Union's criticism of Bulgaria's actions has not been made public in Sofia, but the Sofia Communist Party has secretly distributed leaflets disclosing the Soviet statement. According to the reporter's observation, these leaflets are not widely distributed, as most communists were detained in prison on the night of the German entry into Bulgaria. The prisons in Sofia are now full. A large number of foreigners are now planning to leave Bulgaria for other destinations. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<p>Germany to Conduct New Diplomatic Activities in Southeastern Europe</p>
<p>Berlin – A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry stated today that regarding diplomatic relations between Germany and Yugoslavia, all I can say is that they remain very good. There is no other information. German diplomatic activities never cease. Germany will still launch new diplomatic activities in Southeastern Europe. Regarding British Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks expressing sympathy for the Greek people's arduous fighting, German figures believe they have no significance. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – The British Minister to Yugoslavia, Campbell, who went to Athens a few days ago to report to British Foreign Secretary Eden on Yugoslavia's attitude towards the recent developments in Southeastern Europe, has returned to the Yugoslav capital. It is said that the British government has authorized Campbell to act at his discretion, similar to the British Minister to Bulgaria, should Yugoslavia show any sign of approaching Germany or the Axis powers. All British nationals in Yugoslavia have received orders from the British consular authorities to leave the country as soon as possible. Since Tuesday, a large number of tourists have been evacuating to Turkey and Greece. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia – It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles in the capital that British Foreign Secretary Eden suggested to Greece that it cede the province of Thrace to Turkey. In this way, Greece would no longer border Bulgaria, and if Germany attacked Thessaloniki again, it would be an invasion of Turkish territory. Also, the British Embassy here is urging British nationals in Yugoslavia to evacuate from Yugoslav territory as soon as possible. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>London – Sources usually considered reliable state that Sir Campbell, the British Minister to Yugoslavia, will meet with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister or the Yugoslav Prime Minister today, or both at the same time, after returning to the Yugoslav capital from Athens. Campbell met with British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Chief of Staff Dill in Athens yesterday. It is noted here that the situation in Yugoslavia is becoming increasingly serious. Well-informed sources speculate that the British Minister to Yugoslavia may inform the Yugoslav authorities of the precise details of how Britain can help Yugoslavia resist Germany. London is not optimistic about the future of Yugoslavia, and many believe that Yugoslavia may succumb to the Axis powers. A reliable Turkish source said that in the midst of the changes in the Balkans, there is one good sign: Eden and Dill obtained firm assurances in Ankara that Turkey will not allow Germany to freely pass through European Turkey. If Germany attempts to occupy the Bosphorus Strait, Turkey will fight to prevent it. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e22">A Tragic History of the European War (7): The Missteps of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in the Early Stages of the War <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Hitler once said, "I want to demoralize them." The "them" here, of course, refers to Britain and France. After a whole winter of inaction, Hitler had succeeded in this point. Soldiers digging trenches in the rain to defend against an enemy they had never seen had inevitably grown weary over time. It was possible and indeed necessary to transfer the divisions to the battlefield one by one, actively training them to deal with new forms of terror warfare. All the lessons from the German-Polish War could be used as a guide. But we were too lacking in war psychology. The generals were all cautious and adhered to conventions, which may be commendable in peacetime but unsuitable in wartime. I once questioned a general as to why he did not allow his troops to become familiar with flamethrower tanks and dive bombers.</p>
<p>I said, "If they encounter these monsters for the first time on the front lines, they will be terrified and disoriented. If they are already accustomed to these weapons, they will be able to ignore them and not feel surprised."</p>
<p>He replied, "What you say makes sense, and I have repeatedly requested it, but the response I received has always been something like 'Tank exercises are harmful to crops, and the civil administration firmly opposes them.'"</p>
<p>Behind the front lines, it seemed that no one thought about the danger of enemy attacks. Everyone only talked about idle and boring frustrations. When the war first started, soldiers lacked blankets, wool sweaters, and leather boots. Later, supply agencies were established one after another, and organizations providing support for the troops sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. Cigarettes and other items were sent in an endless stream, so soldiers received too many parcels and too many gifts.</p>
<p>A British soldier said to me solemnly, "Even if I try my best, I can't smoke two hundred cigarettes in one day!"</p>
<p>At this time, famous figures in Paris and London had launched various new initiatives, such as military reading materials, military entertainment, and military games, arts, and theater, etc. These ridiculous actions inadvertently annoyed a woman, who even said she wanted to prepare to set up a new "military war" agency.</p>
<p>In front of the British troops, a "musical troupe" composed of famous comedians and female commentators, escorted by military officers in military vehicles, went to various places to perform. The great musician Marius Salvoli's performances for the British and French armies were even more appreciated by the audience. His arrival in Arras was so grand that even the arrival of President Lebrun paled in comparison. British and French troops cheered him as if [he was important], French soldiers shouting, "Marius, give us a Valentine!" and British soldiers shouting, "Marius, give us a 'Two Pearls' song!"</p>
<p>All of this was certainly exciting and harmless, but it cannot be considered an effective preparation for dealing with the German offensive! At a time of unprecedented severity in the history of Britain and France, there were only a few short weeks to correct past mistakes, complete construction, and train soldiers. The soldiers of both countries continued to live in a drunken stupor, leading a boring life under bureaucratic military management.</p>
<p>In the city of Arras, there were several thousand French colonial soldiers, who had been mobilized from afar and were experienced veterans, but in reality, they were not being used. The military only assigned them to plant flowers and vegetables, raise poultry, and feed rabbits. While this was leisurely and refined, consolidating the fortifications of Arras and Scarpe was perhaps more urgent! My friend, a military officer, boldly offered his opinion to his superiors, but was reprimanded.</p>
<p>"Consolidate the Scarpe? The enemy will never go that deep. You are a defeatist. Go down and wait for orders!"</p>
<p>After one or two such incidents, even the most enthusiastic officers had no choice but to follow orders and not interfere. Because the soldiers were well-fed and had nothing to do all day, they became fat. British soldiers would sit at their desks and write letters to their beloved wives and lovers every night, detailing trivial matters. The officers could not keep up with the inspection, and saw that the stacks of envelopes on the desks, as one stack was removed, another came, piling up even higher than before, so they were naturally no longer happy to inspect them. Verbal disputes had become common in the military. The future of freedom and the fate of the world depended entirely on their fighting power, but they were too busy bickering to remember their duty. Hitler had said it in advance: he had demoralized our military.</p>
<p>I spent several days in the Maginot Line at the end of December, but returned with a full sense of excitement. Seeing this continuous and mysterious mountain range, with its dense gun emplacements and protection from poison gas, I not only gained a great impression of its invincibility, but also admired the soldiers defending it.</p>
<p>The defenders were almost all Lorrainers, recruited locally from the defensive district. Therefore, even in peacetime, they could go to the defense area every Sunday. I met many young officers, lawyers, and engineers who had been calculating the range of artillery shells in the Maginot Line every week for eight years. This painstaking effort had brought the accuracy of the artillery fire to the extreme. In front of the observers in the gun turrets were photographs, dividing the battlefield into countless squares, marked with numbers. If an enemy was seen entering a certain numbered square, they simply had to state the number into the telephone, and within ten seconds, shells would rain down.</p>
<p>The rapid fall of the Maginot Line later was not their fault, but was due to encirclement by the enemy.</p>

<p>London – According to news from the Yugoslav capital in the London Daily News, the Soviet Union insists that Romania must immediately cede several Black Sea naval bases to the Soviet Union. Officials here neither confirm nor deny this news. At the same time, news from the Soviet and German capitals indicates that friction between the Soviet Union and Germany in the Balkans is continuing to grow. Senior government officials in Berlin are criticizing the Soviet note to Bulgaria, which expressed dissatisfaction with Bulgaria's permission for German troops to enter, in rather harsh terms. It is rumored that the German government stated that they do not agree with the Soviet view that Germany's occupation of Bulgaria will expand the scope of the war. "In reality, Bulgaria cannot become a war zone," it is rumored the German side said. "The Germans will never tolerate any restrictions on the strategy to defeat Britain." However, in Moscow, the government radio is reiterating the Soviet statement, criticizing Bulgaria for allowing German troops to enter. (International News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Grain Speculators Still Not Relenting on Foreign Rice; Rumor of 120 Yuan Per "Du" Causes Panic; There is Nothing More Difficult than Eating Today <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice has been repeatedly disrupted by speculators, and has reached huge price reductions under any real influence, reaching the extreme point of public panic, and the market is becoming more and more serious. Common people are pale and panicking as if there is no end. The price reduction in the grey market continues to rise, and there is a rumor of a 2,000 yuan reduction per 100 bags in the small markets. However, later, with the arrival of a large number of goods, the minds of the speculators were discouraged, and many of them got out of the market, so the black market immediately recovered. The actual transactions were reduced to 8,000 bags, and the small markets fell from a reduction of 1,800 yuan to a reduction of 1,450 yuan. Saigon Siam fell from a reduction of 1,800 yuan to a reduction of 1,600 yuan, and Mi Lu fell from 1,000 yuan to 800 yuan, a decrease of two or three yuan per bag compared to the previous black market. Now that there is no obvious manipulation, it may be cheaper again. However, speculators only know about their own cars and villas, and do not know that the public still has a little food to eat. No. 2 rice is sold for 87 yuan, and No. 1 rice is sold for 93 yuan. There is nothing more difficult than eating today.</p>
<p>In the morning, the domestic rice market initially opened. The general cargo owners thought that the source was continuing to be scarce, and their minds were firmer, hoarding and selling at high prices. In this environment, the guests were very afraid of being unable to buy, and their willingness to pay was increasing. Not only did they not dislike the high prices, but they all scrambled to buy each other. Therefore, the chaos at that time was more enthusiastic than the previous two days. The cries of the cargo owners were chaotic and aimless. At the highest time, the price of thick and thin japonica rice soared by as much as six or seven yuan. The price of Kunshan斛 japonica rice opened at 124 yuan, and the price of Qingjiao 斛 thin rice opened at 120 yuan, and according to the general cargo owners' intentions, it was still not enough, and they were still selling at higher prices, seemingly hoping to jump to the sky, with a hint of a 130 yuan price. Unexpectedly, this scene did not last long. In an instant, there were rumors that the foreign rice in the grey market had been frustrated due to the arrival of a large number of goods. Affected by this, both buyers and sellers felt that they were in a dangerous situation, and their minds were shaking. Those who were entering withdrew, and those who were leaving were eager to sell. The general situation reversed, and the sound of selling came, like the wind sweeping away the fallen leaves. The price of thick and thin japonica rice plummeted by as much as three or four yuan. Therefore, the closing price of thick japonica rice was 121 yuan to 118 yuan, and the price of thin rice was 116 yuan, which was actually an increase of about 3 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also presented a situation of first tightness and then fatigue. The result was mediocre, without much honor or disgrace. Hong Kong white rice was still high, from 98 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is coming one after another, and the market price is rising. Obviously, the speculators are deliberately killing people. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Qing Yuan arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, carrying 2,611 bags of foreign rice, and unloading at the wharf of the bank outside the French Concession. It is heard that there are many French ships coming to Shanghai from Saigon, loaded with a large amount of foreign rice within a few days. (Zu)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Flour Market Stable; Cheap Flour to Resume Supply Early Next Week <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Flour – The market was already in a brewing situation yesterday. It was found that the flower bird brand and clock tower brand Australian flour were continuing to be sold because of the profits of the bulls, and once loosened to 28.8 yuan. Jinlong brand Canadian flour was made at 27.8 yuan, but soon the street absorbed it, and the clock tower flower bird recovered to the 29 yuan mark. The market fluctuated gradually, because the speculators had a lot of goods in hand after the continuous surge in prices, and it was reported that the next batch of fixed flour was coming one after another, and the international situation was slightly easing, resulting in unstable public sentiment. Transactions were not active in the afternoon, but speculators were active from time to time, and the market was in a hovering state. The total market transaction was nearly 20,000 bags of various flours. It is heard that the flat-selling flour of the Huachang Factory will resume supply early next week.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour – There are still a large number of arrivals in Shanghai. Taikoo Company's Qing Yuan arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying 21,781 bags of flour from Hong Kong, which are now being unloaded.</p>
<p>Wheat – The transaction was as calm as usual yesterday. The source of domestic wheat has been dry for a long time, and a little foreign wheat has been shipped to Shanghai. In addition to a new ship of Fuxin fixed wheat, 3,000 tons of Australian wheat will arrive in the next batch, so Huachang is not eager to buy Du wheat. The daily factory's door market wants to buy but has no goods, and the market remains as it is.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Miscellaneous Grains; Oil Beans are Climbing <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for oil beans and miscellaneous grains, except for corn, which continued to be repaired by four or five corners, the rest was still firm. Only the yellow beans and oil market are still climbing. It is rare for the production price to be reported high and the vendors to absorb it in the market, resulting in rising sentiment. The yellow beans rose by half a yuan to one and a half yuan. 500 bags of Jiaozhou beans were made, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 600 bags of Guide beans, more than 1,000 bags of Qingdao beans, 1,000 bags of Tianjin beans, and 100 bags of Tianjin green beans. Peanut oil continued to increase by two or three yuan, and 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 100 pieces of Yantai oil, 700 cans of canned, and 50 barrels of Qingdao oil were transacted. The spot price of soybean oil rose by 2 yuan, and the futures market rose sharply by about 3 yuan. 300 barrels of Dalian oil were properly opened, 200 barrels were delivered in March, more than 1,000 barrels were delivered in the first half of April, and 300 dans of Dayou Factory oil and 50 barrels of Pudong Factory oil.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains coming to Shanghai include 200 bags of wheat bran, which were shipped from Hong Kong. Today (7th), there are 10,743 pieces of soybean cake, and 200 bags of peanuts, and 300 cans of raw oil, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Finance Vague Foreign Exchange Market <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listings without any fluctuations. The open market for British and American currencies showed no gains or losses. However, various rumors circulated, generally favoring buying, but none could be confirmed. For instance, there were rumors that the Thai-Vietnamese dispute could be resolved, while others suggested the Soviet Union would favor democratic nations. Consequently, operators did not act in unison. Throughout the day, speculators were active, both buying and selling. The U.S. dollar for the current month was generally traded around 5.50 yuan. During the midday session, it briefly touched 5.53125 yuan, but only momentarily. The closing price for the U.S. dollar was 5.50 yuan, with the pound sterling at 3s 3.375d, showing no change compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Speculation Involved Both Buying and Selling</p>
<p>The morning began with large London transactions, with both near and far futures remaining stable. New York silver prices were also stable, and London gold prices were fixed. Exchange rates between Britain and Shanghai remained stable, while the U.S. dollar saw a minor one-cent change against Shanghai. There was no market for the French franc. Central bank listings for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3s 3.375d for the pound sterling and 5.50 yuan for the U.S. dollar, matching the previous day's closing prices. After opening, Chinese speculators showed some demand, causing a slight weakening in the U.S. dollar for the current month, with prices at 5.46875 yuan. The HSBC listings remained unchanged, and the silver tax was also stable. Thereafter, the market became vague, but speculators continued to buy. At that time, American banks like Chase were still actively selling, leading to a stabilization of the trend. Chase sold U.S. dollars for the current month to Chinese speculators at an average price of 5.50 yuan. Soon after, speculators followed suit and sold, briefly strengthening the dollar in the morning. The March U.S. dollar was absorbed by the Bank of East Asia and foreign banks at a price of 5.53125 yuan. The midday closing prices were 5.50 yuan for the spot U.S. dollar and 3s 3.375d for the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Closing Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>In the latter part of the day, although speculators sold, prices did not strengthen, as both Chinese and foreign banks had sufficient buying appetite. The March dollar continued to trade at 5.50 yuan, and sentiment leaned towards buying, but there was no stampede. Until closing, the market remained stable. The spot and current month U.S. dollar closed at 5.50 yuan, and the pound sterling at 3s 3.375d. Only the current month U.S. dollar saw a slight increase of 0.03125 yuan compared to the previous day, while all other prices remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Gold Market Lacks Clear Direction <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw heated trading in the open market, transitioning into volatility. It shifted from rising to falling, then attempted to advance again. After re-entering the 6,300 yuan level, it broke out again, still influenced by various rumors. Sentiment among different parties shifted from weary to relatively firm. The market opened slightly lower in the morning, but Heng Kee suddenly made a large injection, reaching 4,000 to 5,000 taels, sparking speculation from Hong Kong and Guangdong traders. The price briefly surged to 6,360 yuan before being suppressed by sales from silver houses and securities firms/exchange houses. At noon, there were rumors that the Japanese army had launched a southern advance in Burma and that Soviet Russia would join the British and American democratic bloc. Ren Chen Yong further limited sales to within 6,300 yuan, selling over a thousand taels, causing the price to drop to 6,260 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that the Vichy French authorities had accepted Japanese demands in Vietnam, and that bullish companies in West Shanghai, such as Jia Ma and Xin Yuan Tian Yuan, had increased purchases, causing the price to rise again, reaching 6,345 yuan, before settling at 6,332 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was over 20,000 taels. The morning cash price from Yong Cheng for Lian Xing was 50 taels, 490 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, there were buyers at 460 yuan higher. Prices for jewelry gold and customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Only a Slight Gain of Two Yuan</p>
<p>The morning began quietly, with more sellers than buyers, causing the opening price to drop to 6,310 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The market then felt weaker, retreating below the 6,300 yuan level, first reaching 6,295 yuan. Subsequently, due to a slight weakening in the foreign exchange market, Heng Kee, Cheng Kee, and Ming Feng actively bought, causing the price to rise to 6,360 yuan. Thereafter, sentiment remained influenced by rumors, causing fluctuating trading and a lack of clear direction. Eventually, Qi Yuan, Yi Da, Tong Kang Yong, and Ren Chen Yong all sold, causing a sharper decline, once dropping to 6,260 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market recovered, and retail investors maintained buying interest, pushing the price to 6,280 yuan at midday closing. The afternoon opening showed no change, remaining at 6,280 yuan. However, some retail investors sought to buy at the opening, pushing the price to 6,295 yuan. Shortly after, Tong Kang Yong and Xin Feng Yong sold, causing the trend to decline again, dropping to 6,265 yuan. Subsequently, as the aforementioned positive rumors intensified, buying surged, with companies like Da Feng, Yi Da, and Tian Yuan raising the price to 6,345 yuan. Eventually, Xin Feng Yong sold, causing the price to drop by 20 yuan. The evening closing was surprisingly high, at 6,332 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e32">Sudden Demand for Hong Kong Drafts <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw heated prices, falling before recovering. British, American, and gold pounds initially fell by one yuan before stabilizing. The supply of British gold drafts remained strong, and the market price remained weak. The price of American gold drafts fluctuated, initially at 18.02 yuan, then falling to 18.01 yuan, but soon rising to 18.10 yuan. At noon, it fell back to 18.03 yuan, and in the afternoon, it briefly broke through the 18 yuan level, eventually settling at 18.10 yuan, an increase of 0.10 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a sudden demand for Hong Kong drafts, causing the market price to rise. The price of Japanese gold drafts continued to rise, reaching 1.84 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean drafts remained balanced, and the market price remained stable, at 1.48 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Yarn and Cotton Fabric Difficult Sales in Hong Kong Yarn Prices Plummeted Shuang Ma Brand at Minimum 1347 Yuan <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak and the decline is becoming more severe. This is because of the unrest in western Guangdong and hindered transactions with Hong Kong traders, resulting in weak market confidence. Bullish investors are panic stricken and are painfully liquidating their holdings. At the same time, actual demand is showing signs of weakness, causing the market to become more unstable. However, the majority of the industry is still holding bullish positions, so the decline is still moderate. 20-count Shuang Ma brand yarn reached a high of 1403 yuan and a low of 1354 yuan. In the early afternoon, it started at 1350 yuan, falling to 1347 yuan. Subsequently, due to rising gold prices, profit-takers engaged in short-covering, and the market gradually rose to 1373 yuan. After closing, it was said that there were buyers at 1373 yuan. Today, 2197 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Shuang Ma brand yarn was weak due to the negative sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The initial price was 1386 yuan, soon falling to 1383 yuan. However, a certain large investor continued to buy, and the foreign exchange market opened stably. Bullish investors continued to buy, and the price gradually rose to 1403 yuan. Soon after, rumors resurfaced, and prices in the second session of the exchange fell sharply. A selling frenzy swept through the market, dropping the price to 1380 yuan, but it fluctuated between 1370 and 1380 yuan for some time. By the time of closing, news of a rising foreign exchange market and falling gold prices caused the decline to intensify, reaching 1354 yuan. The closing price was 1360 yuan. Statistics for the half-day trading volume totaled 8270 bales. The amount of purchases by various trading groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 270 bales</p>
<p>Counterparts 8000 bales</p>
<p>Total 8270 bales</p>
<h3 id="e34">Cotton Market Sees Little Progress <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton market remains stagnant, as the yarn market is weak and factory demand is sluggish, resulting in very low market confidence. Only industry insiders are making minor adjustments. In addition, 30 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>In the New York cotton market, due to good cotton fabric trade and purchases by the textile industry, buying sentiment gradually increased, and the market entered a lively and firm state. As a result, closing prices rose by 3 to 12 points, depending on the type, compared to the 10th.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was flat, initially rising due to retail purchases, but later falling due to bullish liquidation and cotton merchants engaging in hedging sales. As a result, yesterday's combined forecast showed a slight decrease of one rupee.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remained sluggish. In the current situation of unrest and fear, the cotton market is at risk of declining further and collapsing.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Securities Bond Market More Likely to Rise Than Fall <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The open market for government bonds saw a situation of volatility. However, in reality the market was easier to rise than fall. During the last few days, bonds had been weak, falling by a sum of one yuan. However, yesterday when a large dealer slightly pulled it up, nearly all of the previous losses were recovered. The morning opening saw Class C bonds initially trading at levels that nearly broke through five yuan. At that time, Tong Kang was actively selling, followed by De Fu and Run Li. Long Tai, Ren Feng, Hong Da, and Ren Chang were actively buying. Class C bonds rose from 5.10 yuan to 5.50 yuan. In the afternoon, Xin Fu also bought, with a volume of 200,000. Ren Chang, Ren Feng, and Hong Da continued to buy. Others such as Xie Xing, Yuan Shun Chang, Heng Fu, and Ding Kang also made smaller purchases. The market price opened at 5.50 yuan, then instantly rose to 6 yuan. Initially, Xie Da, Yong Kang, De Fu, and Lian He supplied sellers, with demand exceeding supply. Subsequently, Tong Kang, Yu Xing, and the newly opened Yi Xing firm actively sold, slightly suppressing the market price. As a result, all bonds except for Class D bonds recovered by three to five jiao (cents). The total trading volume was approximately 2.4 million yuan. A concise summary is listed below:</p>
<p>For stock trading, 50 shares of Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity were traded at a price of 8 yuan. In addition, the stock market at the Public Business Institute showed a steady upward trend, and prices also increased slightly. Although the trading volume was not large, public interest increased significantly. Rubber stocks also showed signs of improvement.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese government bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks showed slight improvement. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 6 shillings and 3 pence, to a price of 8 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) shares registered in England rose by 1 pound, to a price of 74 pounds. Shares registered in Hong Kong rose by 1.5 pounds, to a price of 76.5 pounds. There were asking prices but no sales. All other prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Piece Goods Guangzhou and Hong Kong Stop Loading Cargo Cotton Fabric Decline Intensifies <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Factory Fabric: Yesterday, the market continued to weaken and the decline intensified. This was because some merchants in Guangdong and Hong Kong stopped loading cargo, causing market confidence to weaken and causing a surge of panic sales. The market price declined step by step. Later in the market, there was a slight recovery. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill fell by around one yuan per piece. Coarse cloth fell by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. The market for bleached and dyed cloth was chaotic, falling by 0.50 to 1 yuan. However, prices for items with a shortage remained firm. Around 200 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. Merchants from other regions were waiting and watching. Only merchants from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces made small purchases. Demand from northern regions was also weak. In addition, 1385 pieces of cotton fabric are being shipped to Hong Kong today (the 7th).</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment continued to be weak, with many sellers unloading their goods. The lowest selling price for spot goods of high-quality white cloth was 45.34 yuan. Subsequently, due to excessive price drops, industry insiders made some purchases, bringing the price back up to 46.40 yuan, which was a further drop of 1.20 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. The decline in futures on the exchange was even more severe. The closing price for the current month was also 46.40 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan per piece. The price of Four Gentlemen Serge was relatively firm due to limited inventory. It once fell to 1.267 yuan but recovered to 1.30 yuan by closing.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Near-Market Raincoat Fabric <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Western Goods: Among raincoat fabrics, "Kai Shui Mi" is considered the most famous. Because it is sturdy and durable, it is well-suited for both Chinese and Western attire. 4026 fabric is widely sold because the fabric is non-stiff and doesn't delaminate. Recently, because shipments have been lacking and the inventory is low, prices have risen significantly compared to the previous year. Wholesale prices are 23-24 yuan per yard. Fabric with a napped surface and slightly thinner quality sells for 21-22 yuan. The sales volume is not as active as "Kai Shui Mi."</p>
<p>Eastern Goods: Currently, only double-sided gauze is circulating on the market. The majority is stock from the previous years. There have been no recent shipments to Shanghai. Large raincoat companies and lower-class people are taking advantage of the low prices, leading to strong sales. Yesterday's market price was 4.50-4.60 yuan per yard at wholesale.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods: Although there were early inventions, they easily leaked water, leading to limited sales. Later, China National Underwear Company and Shanghai Rain Cloth Factory invented fabrics specifically for door and curtain shops, but they lacked retail sales. As a result, You Sheng Factory and Ren Tai Factory's products have emerged. Yesterday, You Sheng's rainproof fabric sold for 4.25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Metals Council Iron Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>There is strong demand for Council Iron from canneries, toy factories, printing companies, biscuit companies, cigarette factories, etc. However, recently, there are no foreign shipments arriving. Plus, trading groups are actively absorbing iron in the market causing a shortage. This caused worries about the imbalance of supply and demand, causing those in the trade to increase prices. Yesterday's market price was 240 yuan per case for 200-pound old steel factory iron, and 230 yuan per case for new steel factory iron. Compared to the previous market, prices have increased by tens of yuan. Other "wild chicken" goods also require over 200 yuan per case.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Sugar Market Prices Stable <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable, with little fluctuation.

<p>Jujubes from Fu Prefecture: Divided into Jinan and Zou County types. Since the beginning of spring, there have been no continued arrivals. This has caused local inventory to dwindle. Recently, sales have been strong in Dinghai, Shenjiamen, Hangzhou, etc. Causing prices to rise. In the past two days, over 100 bags of Jinan Prefecture jujubes were opened at 40 yuan, and over 90 bags of Zou County Fu jujubes at 42 yuan, both increasing by 2-3 yuan. These goods have excellent color and are well-suited for sales. The market is expected to continue to tighten.</p>
<p>Hunan Lotus Root: Due to sluggish recent sales, the trend has weakened. Yesterday, local lotus root opened at 255 to 250 yuan, with average quality, decreasing by 5 yuan. With scarce sales, further declines are still possible.</p>

<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>(3) Foreign Currency Fixed-Term Savings Deposits</p>
<p>The National Savings Fund, to facilitate Overseas Chinese and domestic residents who wish to save foreign currencies, stipulated that foreign currency deposit accounts could be opened. Later, Overseas Chinese and domestic merchants, whether for business or for economic development, always wanted to deposit foreign currencies in domestic banks for future use, reducing the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, the National Savings Fund expanded the foreign currency deposit measures and announced the Foreign Currency Fixed-Term Savings Deposit measures by the Ministry of Finance on October 27, 1939. It stipulated that the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and Farmers would handle the deposits, and the government would provide special protection. In addition to the four banks, the Ministry of Finance could approve banks that handle savings business to handle the conversion of legal currency into foreign currency savings deposits, and the four banks would provide transfer convenience to benefit the people.</p>
<p>This deposit is divided into two types. The first type is foreign currency fixed-term savings deposits, which can be deposited in British, American, and other foreign currencies approved by the government. At maturity, the principal and interest are paid in the original foreign currency. The term is 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, and the interest rates are 4, 5, 6, and 7 percent. The second type is legal currency converted into foreign currency fixed-term savings deposits, which can be deposited with legal currency converted into foreign currency at commercial exchange rates. At maturity, the principal and interest should be withdrawn from the original bank at the original deposit location. The term is 3, 4, or 5 years, and the interest rates are 2, 2.5, and 3 percent, but the deposit amount is limited to 20,000 legal currency dollars.</p>
<p>(4) Gold Public Bonds</p>
<p>In addition to the above three items, those who own gold also have a clever way to preserve wealth, which is to quickly purchase government gold public bonds. Since the start of the war, the National Government has issued two gold public bonds. The first was the 1938 Gold Public Bond, and the regulations were promulgated by the National Government on April 21, 1938. The second was the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bond, and the regulations were promulgated by the National Government on March 1, 1940. Both took effect on the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>The 1938 Gold Public Bond was divided into three types of bonds: customs gold bonds worth 100 million customs gold units, British gold bonds worth 10 million pounds, and American gold bonds worth 50 million dollars. Purchase methods: (1) Those who pay with customs gold vouchers or raw gold and its products or gold coins will be issued customs gold bonds. In addition to customs gold vouchers based on the voucher amount, others will be converted into customs gold based on the pure gold content of 60.1866 milligrams of pure gold per customs gold unit. (2) Those who pay with British and American currency will be issued British and American gold public bonds. (3) Those who pay with foreign securities based on the selling price at the time will also be issued British and American gold public bonds based on the British and American gold obtained. (4) Those who pay with other foreign currencies, foreign exchange, or foreign securities will be issued one or several types of bonds based on the buyer's preference, converted into customs gold or British and American gold at market prices. The annual interest rate is 5%, paid twice a year. The bonds are divided into five types: 10, 50, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 customs gold units, five types of 5, 10, 50, 100, and 1,000 pounds, and six types of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1,000, and 5,000 dollars.</p>
<p>The 1940 Construction Gold Public Bond was divided into two types of bonds: British gold bonds worth 10 million pounds and American gold bonds worth 50 million dollars. Purchase methods: (1) Those who pay with foreign currency or foreign exchange will be issued British and American gold bonds based on the British and American gold paid. (2) Those who pay with other foreign currencies or foreign exchange will be issued bonds based on the buyer's preference, converted into British and American gold at current exchange rates. (3) Those who pay with legal currency can be issued bonds converted into British or American gold at commercial exchange rates. The annual interest rate is 5%, paid every six months. The bonds are divided into five types: 5, 10, 50, 100, and 1,000 pounds, and six types of 5, 10, 50, 100, 1,000, and 5,000 dollars.</p>
<p>These two types of gold public bonds are paid in customs gold, British gold, and American gold when repaying principal and interest. All are bearer bonds and can be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged. They can be used as substitutes when paying security deposits for official purposes, and can also be used as bank guarantee reserves.</p>
<p>The above four methods of investing funds are sufficient for fund owners to freely choose. If you like to hold legal currency, then you can subscribe to the National Savings Fund or subscribe to National Savings Bonds. If you like to hold foreign currency, then you can deposit foreign currency fixed-term savings deposits or purchase gold public bonds. The superior interest is far superior to the American commercial banks that do not give interest and charge handling fees. The South Pacific war has not yet broken out. Take this opportunity to select a safe target for your funds and arrange it in advance. Don't hesitate and miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai who own funds: seize the opportunity and choose the most favorable and convenient of the above four methods to implement. This is the only clever way to preserve wealth. It is impossible to solve the problem by just racking your brains in the Shanghai market. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Authorities Should Take Responsibility for Maintaining People's Livelihood and Curbing Prices Rice and Coal, Other Daily Necessities Rise Sharply Again People Can't Make a Living, Worrying about the Future of Social Order Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee to Discuss Rice Prices Today <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai rice market has seen successive peaks under the manipulation and hoarding of speculators. Citizens have repeatedly appealed, demanding that the authorities quickly develop good methods to improve the rice market. Rice industry groups have also repeatedly reported to the authorities the difficulties in reforming the rice market. Yesterday, it was learned that the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, in order to resolve the issue of food rice in the city, has scheduled a meeting this afternoon to discuss everything. According to reports from the Great China News Agency to relevant parties, the content of the discussion includes three points: (1) The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's opinions on reforming the rice market; (2) The Shanghai Rice Dealers Association's request that the authorities order holders of goods to sell at least 10,000 bags of rice per day at the limited price to various rice dealers for retail to citizens; (3) How to make hoarders sell goods and suppress rice prices. There may be important decisions regarding the food issue. Citizens are now waiting quietly for the authorities to take action. If the perpetrators are once again left unchecked, it is feared that they will take risks.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Profits 30 Percent</p>
<p>The Financial and Commercial News reports that Shanghai's imports of foreign rice last year reached 392,225 tons (calculated at 10 quintals per ton, and 1 quintal is equal to 2 market dans), valued at US$13.9 million. The previous year was only 45,765 tons, valued at US$1.4 million. Last year's foreign rice imports increased by about ten times compared to previous years. Imports in January this year exceeded 50,000 tons, and imports in February were 30,000 tons, with orders placed for 60,000 tons, all waiting for shipment to Shanghai. The current wholesale price of No. 2 Saigon rice in Shanghai (including cargo rack insurance and freight) is US$44.30 per ton. Calculated at the national currency of 100 yuan per US$5.50, the selling price per ton is only 805.37 yuan. Adding dock rent, delivery fees, etc. of 40 yuan, and a profit of 3% (34.16 yuan), the selling price per ton should be 869.53 yuan, and the selling price per bag is about 86.95 yuan, and the selling price per shi (unit of dry measure) is about 67.82 yuan (currently, the black market sells for over 80 yuan per shi, and compared to the cost, the profit is nearly 20 yuan per shi). Recently, Japan and Vietnam established a goods exchange agreement, stipulating that Japan can purchase 700,000 tons of rice from Vietnam in the coming months. The general fear that West Saigon rice shipments to Shanghai will be affected is an overreaction. Even if Saigon rice shipments to Shanghai may have difficulties, Yangon rice can replace it. In addition, Myanmar had a very abundant harvest last year, which can certainly meet the needs of this city. In January of this year, Myanmar rice accounted for the second largest share of Shanghai's foreign rice imports (Vietnam ranked first). Due to ship assembly issues, Yangon rice has not been imported in large quantities yet.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Situation to Raise Market Prices</p>
<p>The inventory of rice and coal in this city is indeed very abundant. The total amount of rice in the city is over 1.5 million bags, and the inventory of Yan Bai coal is also 300,000 tons. However, the markets for various industries have recently reached a situation where there are goods but no sales. This is nothing more than the result of general speculative merchants manipulating, monopolizing, and hoarding. These people's intentions are unpredictable, and they repeatedly fabricate falsehoods, attempting to confuse people and take the opportunity to raise prices for profit. Once any international or domestic changes occur, these merchants will hoard goods. Therefore, the most important thing at present is to ban hoarding. If an investigation confirms it, severe punishment should be given, without any leniency. Otherwise, it will not be enough to warn others. If anyone who is responsible for suppressing rice or coal prices attempts to hoard goods, the punishment should be doubled. The four million residents of the city, in addition to keeping themselves clean and saving all unnecessary expenses, are all eagerly awaiting the two concessions to take the same steps to sanction these profiteering speculative merchants, so that they will hoard existing goods and sell them off at suppressed prices. Only then will the market stabilize and the people's hardship can be relieved. Otherwise, they will not be able to live.</p>
<p>Coal Market Disturbance Little Actual Trading</p>
<p>General speculative coal merchants take the opportunity to move, disregard the people's livelihood and social order, and repeatedly raise prices for profit. The market prices of various Yan Bai coals have been gradually increased. Because of the unstable international situation, these people, citing the potential interruption of coal sources, hold large amounts of existing goods, attempting to hoard them. Yesterday, after the coal market opened, speculative coal merchants became even more active, and the market was very chaotic. Although holders of goods sold off some of their hoarded goods in small quantities, the prices were more than ten yuan higher per ton than the previous market. Buyers were unwilling to purchase at such high prices. There was a noisy atmosphere, and market order was not as good as before. Considering that the coal inventory has not decreased compared to before, according to coal industry sources, it is enough to meet the needs of the city for three months, with Yitai Xing hoarding the most.</p>
<h3 id="e44">British and American Interests in China Not Entrusted to Other Countries for Management: Diplomatic Authorities of Britain, the United States, Spain, and Portugal Yesterday Firmly Denied It <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>On the day following the arrival in Shanghai of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Japanese-language *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun* suddenly published a report stating that Britain and the United States had decided to entrust their interests in China to Spain and Portugal for management. It seemed that the second step taken by Britain and the United States, in addition to advising their nationals in the Far East to evacuate if it was unnecessary for them to stay, was that the American troops in China, British and American nationals, and diplomats were preparing to withdraw from China completely. We believe that their interests in China would not be entrusted to Spain and Portugal for management. The dissemination of this news has aroused considerable attention from various parties and is enough to confuse people.</p>
<p>American and British Consulates Absolutely Deny It</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited the aforementioned diplomatic authorities of the four countries in Shanghai to inquire about the truth. It was proven to be completely inaccurate and a groundless rumor. Upon arriving at the American Consulate General, Consul General Lockhart was out on official business. Administrative Consul Stanton received the reporter and stated, "This news is completely groundless." The reporter then went to the British Consulate General. British Consul General George indirectly replied, "This report is completely inaccurate." Consul Ford of the consulate said, "If this were the case, how could it be that not a single official in the entire consulate knew about it?"</p>
<p>This Rumor Has No Basis</p>
<p>Spanish Consul General Yguier also replied by telephone, "There is not the slightest certainty about this matter, and even I myself do not know about it." Mr. Sacas, the Chinese Secretary of the Portuguese Legation, has also firmly denied this statement. Portuguese Consul General Manero also stated that he was unaware of the matter. According to a certain foreign observer, this is probably the dream of the Japanese, because Britain and the United States are now determined to safeguard their interests in China. If one country were to abandon China, Japan would still have some concerns and would find it difficult to freely control all of China.</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun* Reported It This Way</p>
<p>According to yesterday's *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun*: (1) "The British and American authorities are extremely concerned about their interests in China due to the increasingly deteriorating situation in the Far East. According to reliable sources, the American Consulate General in Shanghai intends to entrust the Spanish Consulate General with the management of all American interests in China and all other measures. Consul General Lockhart and Spanish Consul General Yguier have discussed this matter several times, and it is rumored that a formal decision has already been made. The registration of American property in Shanghai has not yet been completed. It is impossible to transfer it to the Spanish authorities at this time. Therefore, the American Consulate General is supervising its officials day and night to expedite the preparation of a catalog. On the other hand, the Spanish Consulate General is also mobilizing missionaries and prominent expatriates to assist in the processing due to a shortage of manpower. Similar measures are being taken in other places besides Shanghai. The reason why American interests in China are entrusted to the Spanish authorities is that when Spain was in internal turmoil, the American Consul General automatically took responsibility for protecting the property of Spanish missionaries when the left-leaning Spanish Consul threatened them. Because of this relationship, the two countries in Shanghai were able to establish close contact. As for the British Consulate General, it is taking the same approach as the United States and plans to entrust the Portuguese Consulate General with the management of its interests in China. This matter is currently still under discussion. (2) Due to concerns about the deteriorating world situation, Far Eastern British and American banks held a meeting of Far Eastern British and American bank managers in Hong Kong on the 5th of this month to study various countermeasures in case the situation worsens. The meeting discussed the handling of banks in the event of a future withdrawal and other important matters. The Shanghai branch was represented by Citibank Deputy Manager Mr. Marsh."</p>
<h3 id="e45">Approval of Temporary Measures for Reducing Electricity Supply: Motor Power Reduced by 30 Percent; Those Exceeding the Limit Will Be Charged Three Times the Electricity Fee; Detailed Allocation Methods to Be Considered by Experts <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's report, the Shanghai Power Company has reported to the Council that it is experiencing a shortage of fuel, which is only half of what the company needs, and is insufficient to cope with the situation. The Council immediately appointed a subcommittee to discuss the matter specifically, as previously announced. At present, the subcommittee has conducted detailed research on the issue of electricity allocation and has submitted several important measures to the Council for consideration and decision, with the aim of implementing the best ones. The aforementioned issue was submitted to the Council's regular board meeting on the evening of the 5th for comprehensive discussion, and various plans from the company were also consulted.</p>
<p>Recruiting Experts for Fundamental Research</p>
<p>First of all, it should be stated that various steps have already been taken to obtain more fuel in order to minimize interference with electricity use. The Council will also recruit several experts of different nationalities to work with representatives of the Shanghai Power Company to draft detailed measures for the allocation of electricity supply. Various industries will be classified according to their service to society, and then allocation will be made according to the category. At the same time, the findings will be compiled into a report as soon as possible and submitted for approval. Before the report is provided, the Council does not want to make any presumptions, but at this time, it can be stated as an explanation that the reduction in the amount of electricity supplied to the public will be less than the reduction to commercial consumers, which is hoped to be unanimously agreed upon.</p>
<p>Provisional Temporary Electricity Saving Measures</p>
<p>The current situation requires immediate action. Therefore, the Council has decided to approve the Shanghai Power Company to implement temporary measures. It is hoped that all sectors will cooperate with these measures. The detailed situation will be announced separately by the company. The important parts are as follows: "All users, regardless of the amount of electricity they use, should conserve electricity as much as possible for the public interest. For those who use motor power and whose monthly maximum consumption has exceeded 1,000 kilowatt-hours since January of last year, the company will immediately notify them to limit their electricity consumption for the next month to 70% from the date of the meter reading. The portion exceeding 70% (limited to 1,000 kilowatt-hours) will be charged at a rate equal to three times the normal fee. As for users whose monthly electricity consumption is at or below 1,000 kilowatt-hours but need to exceed the above amount, the excess portion will also be charged at a rate equal to three times the normal fee. The surplus funds collected from this surcharge will be separately deposited by the company and used for purposes beneficial to the users, as approved by the Council." In addition, it must be solemnly stated that the above measures are of a completely temporary nature and will only be effective until the experts provide a report. It is hoped that these measures will give all users an opportunity to experiment with limiting electricity use.</p>
<p>Wastage of Electricity Should Be Prohibited</p>
<p>Among the factories in the International Settlement, some use steam power, etc., but those using electricity account for 80%, while those using steam only account for 50%, and others account for 5%. Last year, the total electricity consumption in the International Settlement was 705,198,000 kilowatt-hours, of which 80% was industrial electricity and commercial consumption only accounted for 10%. Therefore, after the implementation of electricity reduction, the impact on the industrial sector is the greatest. People in the industrial and commercial sectors believe that the authorities' measures to reduce electricity will only be limited to motor power. If this is implemented, Shanghai's industrial sector will inevitably suffer a serious blow, and Shanghai's prosperity will be damaged. Therefore, all parties have expressed their wishes: (1) It should be implemented universally so that the industrial and commercial sectors can develop in parallel; (2) Effective control should be imposed on the wastage of electricity, such as gradually reducing or prohibiting unnecessary neon lights and electric light advertisements, advising shops and entertainment venues to close earlier, and rejecting applications to open non-essential businesses that consume a lot of electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Municipal Council Establishes Subcommittee to Study Sources of Revenue: Investigation into the Scope of License Fee Collection <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Committee of the Municipal Council, recognizing the extreme importance of finding ways to increase revenue for the welfare of the International Settlement, has suggested to the Council that a subcommittee be formed to investigate the authority and scope of the Municipal Council to collect taxes and license fees, and to report the results to the Council. It is said that the new subcommittee should re-examine the current tax policy, because according to the current tax policy, although certain businesses are required to have licenses, in fact, they do not have licenses. Therefore, this regulation should be amended to expand the scope of license fee collection.</p>

<p>Municipal Council Police Chief Major Bowen told Western reporters yesterday morning (the 6th) that the special police force in the Joint District of Western Shanghai will begin operations on March 15. The special police officers are currently being measured for their new uniforms. The uniforms of the special police will be made in the style of the "City Police" uniforms, but with a special cap badge to distinguish them from the Municipal Council police officers and the City Police. It is heard that the final details regarding the special police force are currently being discussed by Pan Da and 克立沙. According to the police power agreement signed on February 1, the number of special police officers is limited to 1,200. It is not known whether the number of police officers currently designated to be transferred to the special police force has reached 1,200, but it is heard that the junior police officers and the officers in charge of the five police districts have already been appointed.</p>

It is heard that the reserve is specifically for handling all receipts and disbursements for members and does not operate externally. Its purpose is to increase reserves to cope with all situations.</p>

<p>The War of Resistance has entered its fifth year, and victory is in sight. People from all walks of life across the country and overseas Chinese, in a state of extreme excitement, have launched campaigns to donate money to support the war effort. National comfort missions have been organized to continue to operate and add reception centers, implement subsidies for marriages and funerals of war dependents, provide air raid relief, educate children, establish schools for the children of veterans, and provide a large supply of spiritual food to the front lines. Competition methods are adopted in various industries, with the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors and wealthy gentry as the key targets for fundraising. The competition in the wartime capital resulted in more than 4 million yuan. It is learned that in Shanghai, a group of enthusiastic individuals donated more than 200,000 yuan and formally organized the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Motivating Donations to Support the War Effort. It is actively responding, working hard to promote the effort, and mobilizing various units to raise money diligently. It is expected that there will be amazing results.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is "March 8" Women's Day. Due to the current special environment, women's organizations in the city will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, in view of the great responsibilities that women should bear in wartime, it has been decided to actively promote the cash donation movement, which will be sent to the National Women's Comforting General Association and distributed to various places to express the concern of Shanghai women for the war effort. It is also learned that March 11 is Professional Women's Day. Women's organizations in the city, such as the National YWCA of China, have decided to hold a commemorative meeting on that day at the Navy YMCA on Sichuan Road. Foreign women's organizations in the city will also participate in the commemoration on that day.</p>
<p>Encouragement to Work Hard in One's Respective Position</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Circle's Integrity Movement Committee's message for "March 8" to women compatriots states: "The War of Resistance has now entered its fifth year. Although final victory is getting closer, the arduous work has not yet been completed. There are countless efforts that remain to be made by our compatriots across the country, especially by our female compatriots, who account for half of the population. We are in this great era of the War of Resistance, and we are also celebrating the 30th 'March 8' Women's Day and the 7th anniversary of the New Life Movement. Therefore, our association would like to offer the following suggestions to our sisters in Shanghai: First, we must recognize that 'March 8' Women's Day is a day to awaken the masses of women to participate in the revolutionary movement. At present, our country is carrying out unprecedented national, political, and economic revolutions. Therefore, our more than 2 million female compatriots, who account for half of Shanghai's 5 million citizens, should actively mobilize women from all walks of life to work hard in their respective positions. In particular, the large number of working women and housewives should strive to fulfill this sacred mission. By 'work in one's respective position,' we mean at least to abide by the spirit and creed of the New Life Movement in thought, namely propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and to fulfill at least the national oath stipulated in the General Mobilization Outline of the National Spirit in behavior. Secondly, we must call the attention of female compatriots in the intellectual circles. 'March 8' is a day to actively seek the interests of the masses of women and to passively seek to remove the oppression of the masses of women. Then, who should bear the responsibility of guiding this movement? Undoubtedly, this responsibility must be borne by the intellectuals of our city's women's circles, such as female teachers and female students. You should organize lectures and hold press conferences on this day to call for the general mobilization of women compatriots across the city, telling them that the interests of the masses of women are subordinate to the interests of the nation and the country, and that to seek women's freedom and liberation, we must first strive for the freedom of the country and the liberation of the nation, and extensively mobilize them to participate in the current practical work of the War of Resistance. Thirdly, what kinds of work can and must our female compatriots carry out in the current environment? We believe that the specific work in daily life that Chairman Chiang instructed us on the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, such as thoroughly eradicating opium addiction, abstaining from gambling, universally practicing thrift and savings, promoting hygiene and physical education, and developing clean habits, are all simple and easy to do. If we can earnestly follow them, they will all be of great direct and indirect benefit to the War of Resistance."</p>

<p>The "Messina" small steamer, managed by the Dalong Steamship Company at 29 Avenue Edward VII, with a deadweight of 40 tons, travels to various ports such as Changyinsha and Hupu, specializing in carrying cargo and not passengers. It loaded more than 300 pieces of export cargo in Shanghai on the night before last (the 4th) at 2:00 AM (i.e., 2:00 AM on the 5th). At 10:00 AM on the 5th, when it sailed near Baimaokou, the weather was bad and the wind and waves gradually increased. Because the boat was very small and was hit by strong winds and waves, it could not withstand it. Allowing the wind to blow and the waves to hit, it ran aground on a reef. All the cargo loaded was washed into the Yangtze River, drifting away without a trace. Fortunately, a foreign ship passed by at the time and rescued all of the ten or so crew members. They have returned to Shanghai safely yesterday. It is said that the hull has sunk and there is no hope of salvage.

<h3 id="e52">Japanese Blockade of the South China Coastline Causes Difficulties for Chinese Merchants: Export Market Limited to Southeast Asia; Japanese Actively Deploying Southward Advance Steps <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 6th), it was rumored that the coastline of South China, stretching 214 miles from west of Macau to near Tokyo Bay, had been completely blockaded by the Japanese, and that Japanese troops had landed in various places along the coastline. This poses another serious problem for Chinese manufacturers in the city.</p>
<p>Inland Cargo Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>According to the owner of a major Chinese factory who spoke to reporters yesterday afternoon, almost all of the secret routes used last year to transport half of the city's manufactured export goods via Zhejiang and small coastal ports in South China to Free China have been completely cut off. The remaining market for the city's exports is now limited to the Southeast Asian islands and South American countries. The Shanghai market did not immediately feel the impact of the South China blockade yesterday morning, but the future seems quite bleak, as there may not be enough buyers for Shanghai products.</p>
<p>Japanese Claim Supply Routes</p>
<p>According to a Japanese military officer here yesterday morning, the Japanese authorities previously only knew that the supply routes to Chongqing were the Burma Road, the Northwest Road, and routes through Manchuria. It was not until early last month, when Japanese troops engaged in small-scale battles in the Dapeng Bay area, that they discovered that there was also a supply route along the coast between Beihai and Guangzhou. They then conducted a careful investigation and learned that Chinese junks carrying supplies were secretly crossing the Japanese naval blockade line and sailing to the coast to be transported to Chongqing. Therefore, they dispatched Japanese troops to land and occupy Beihai and other places to cut off this important supply route.</p>
<p>Pioneers Have Already Set Out</p>
<p>Recently, in order to aggressively seek southward expansion, the Japanese, in addition to making various military preparations, have also actively dispatched personnel to various parts of Southeast Asia to serve as spies. According to yesterday's *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun*, 85 "拓士道場生" from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office departed from Tokyo Station at 3:25 PM on the 2nd of this month to go to India, Thailand, Borneo, and other places to serve as "front-line development suicide squads" and to act as "pioneering vanguards."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a telegram to the Shanghai trade associations, saying: "Shanghai is the hub of our country's industry and commerce, and its economic trends are related to the prosperity of the whole country. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has promoted production and construction and worked hard to encourage the people. The industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have always been in a difficult situation. Our industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, after the government moved westward, have struggled hard, remained unyielding, and either moved to the interior to continue their work or moved their factories to special zones to show their determination not to cooperate with the enemy. Your patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. It is hoped that our industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai will prevent economic aggression and maintain the independence of our sovereignty and the integrity of our administration. All matters relating to companies, firms, and trademarks must be registered in accordance with the law. If the licenses that have been issued are lost, they should be promptly reapplied for. If any words or stamps are added to your legal licenses due to environmental threats, the added words or stamps shall be deemed invalid. This is a matter of safeguarding our country's industrial and commercial legal rights and should be followed by all. In the situation in Shanghai, all undertakings have lost their guarantees. During this period, we should step up the transfer of capital inward, gather manpower, material resources, and financial resources to promote the construction of Free China and complete the great cause of the War of Resistance. The Ministry has high hopes for this."</p>

<p>As previously reported, Dr. Baker of the American Red Cross will be in charge of the Yunnan-Burma Road. Yesterday, according to news from the mainland, American Red Cross personnel in this city met with reporters yesterday (the 5th). The local Red Cross had not received any news that Dr. Baker would resign as the relief director of the American Red Cross in China and assume the chairmanship of the Yunnan-Burma Road Committee, which is currently being organized for the purpose of unifying Yunnan-Burma Road transportation. A Hong Kong telegram quoted Dr. Baker as saying that he had no comment, but he did not deny it either. It is heard that Dr. Baker is waiting for approval from the New York Red Cross headquarters and has not yet accepted the new position. Dr. Baker recently spent a year in the United States discussing relief in China with the Red Cross before returning to China to inspect various places and accompany Dr. Currie, an administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, on a trip back and forth from Hong Kong to Chongqing. When the Yangtze River flooded and caused a disaster in 1931, Dr. Baker planned and directed the relief work, which was of great merit and known worldwide.</p>

<p>Li Bingzhong, a rice merchant residing at 61 Yongshun Lane, 20th Street, French Concession, received more than 2,000 yuan in cash and two bank checks totaling more than 2,000 yuan from a rice shop on Fuzhou Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. He put them in a yellow leather wallet and carried it under his arm to the Dongxinqiao bus stop on Avenue Edward VII, where he boarded a French public bus No. 22, intending to go home. When the bus reached the intersection of Rue Cardinal Mercier and Rue de Montauban, four robbers suddenly appeared in the bus. One of them took out a gun to intimidate the passengers and forbade them from making any noise. The other three thieves stepped forward and forcibly snatched the wallet from Li's arm. When the bus stopped at the station, they calmly got off the bus in a throng and fled in all directions. When Li was robbed, he dared not resist because he saw that the thieves had guns. The passengers and ticket seller in the bus also dared not say anything. After the thieves were far away, the victim, having calmed down from the shock, got off the bus and reported the incident to the Avenue Joffre Police Station, requesting them to investigate and arrest the thieves.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhijun, a native of Zhengde, Anhui, is the chairman of Xinyi Yarn Factory at No. 60 Moganshan Road and the manager of Jiu'an Trust Company at No. 300 Beijing Road. Around 9:00 AM on January 20th of this year, while at his residence at No. 34 Stade Road, he was riding in his own car to the front of No. 88 Chuanwu Yuan Road when he was surrounded by seven or eight kidnappers lying in ambush. Zhou hurriedly opened the door and fled, but was shot in the buttocks by a bandit. The bandits also fled. Zhou was helped into the car by his driver, Yu Juchang, and taken to the hospital for treatment. On February 24th at 5:00 AM, Chief Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Kong Guangxiao, and Wang Yongjun of the Putuo Police Station received a tip-off from Ningbo. They rushed to Xiaoshadu Road and arrested three bandits involved in the case, Wang Xiao'erzi, Lu Yuhai, and Yan Jinkui. They confiscated a handgun with the fire seal of the early Ning County government and six bullets. They were sent to the First Special Court to request strict investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the court and prosecuted for attempted kidnapping and attempted murder with a firearm. Judge Feng took the bench and examined the case. Although the crime scene was on Bowuyuan Road, the criminals were arrested by the Putuo Police Station, so it should be transferred to the Third Court for trial. Then, the staff escorted the defendants to the Third Court. Jiang Baolian, the lawyer from the police station, recounted the process of solving the case. Judge Huang Risheng interrogated the first defendant, Wang Xiao'erzi, who confessed, "We are all disbanded soldiers from early Ning County. Because we had no way to make a living, we banded together and came to Shanghai to commit crimes. I did shoot the victim in the buttocks, but my intention was only to injure him. If I wanted to kill him, it would not have been difficult. I am a very accurate marksman in the army." The second and third defendants confessed, "We were only responsible for guarding the driver, preparing to kidnap Zhou Zhijun. One of us was in charge of watching the ransom. Later, the matter was unsuccessful, and we fled. On the 24th of last month, we were discussing the matter at the Qunle Teahouse at No. 1120 Xiaoshadu Road when we were unfortunately arrested. We beg the court for leniency." Judge Huang reviewed the situation and ordered them to be detained and the trial adjourned.</p>

<p>The Western Football League, this week's Group A league match, the Donghua vs. Portugal match is of great importance to the championship and has attracted much attention from fans. Donghua's starting lineup was officially announced by Li Baojun yesterday. In the reserve group, there are many talents, and the lineup was originally very strong. However, the joint A lineup is inevitably disappointing. Since Li Ning has retired, Dai Linjing will not play on the front line. At this critical juncture of life and death, the success or failure depends on the championship. It is indeed disheartening for those who love Donghua to fight with a "lame horse" lineup. It is intended that military advisor Li may give up one side and deal with the Western Police with all his strength. The referees for each match at the end of the week were also announced yesterday. At the same time, Mr. Steele also announced that the Steele Cup final between St. Francis and Beixi Children in the two matches at the racecourse on Sunday was changed to 30 minutes per half due to the interlude of the special performance match in the first match. Therefore, the Steele Cup final, which was originally scheduled to start at 2:30 PM, will also be postponed to 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>Since the seventh Zhongxi Public Handball Singles has started, the fifth act of the competition will be held tonight. Chinese champion Sun Jialu will face Gilbert Meng tonight. Sun has not been very successful in this competition due to bad luck. Gilbert Meng's skills are mediocre and should not be able to withstand Sun's attack. In another match, Chen Lin'an will face M. Kequeling. Chen has only lost to F. Kequeling once since the start of the competition. Tonight's match is crucial to his future. If Zhang Xianlun can defeat F. Kequeling tonight, then Chen will have the same score as F. Kequeling. According to the competition rules, another final will be held to determine the champion. Currently, F. Kequeling has the best situation with four wins in four matches. The order of play and the current situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Order of Play Tonight</p>

<p>The Shanghai Star basketball team failed to achieve its goals at the YMCA, so it has been working hard recently. Last week, it had a friendly match with Mike White, and Shanghai had a significant victory. It has now arranged a friendly match with the military officers' team from the current YMCA at the YMCA gym tomorrow night. At the same time, the Shanghai Star women's team will also play against Guanghua. The military officers have excellent skills, and the Shanghai Star has a strong fighting spirit. The two sides are evenly matched, and the performance will be exciting.</p>

<p>The International Table Tennis Association held a full committee meeting at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday at the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to review the team rosters. The attendees were Yu Binqi, Chen Linhua, Di Fei, Sasha Jin, Fuliutuo, Malimu, Bao Aisheng, Feiximeng, Chuan Guiqing, Liu Keren, and others, a total of ten people. Yu Binqi chaired the meeting and immediately passed the team rosters for each group. The Xinu Peide team in the women's group was disqualified because the roster had not been submitted and the deposit had not been paid in full. Then, the committee discussed the case of Qibu's three women's teams A, B, and C requesting to participate in the competition to increase the interest of the women's group. Each member believed that the registration deadline had passed and it was not convenient to make an exception, so it was rejected. Currently, there are only five teams participating in the women's group. In the future, the champion will undoubtedly come from the China United, Women's Youth, and Jewish teams. The Association has scheduled to hold a meeting of the team captains at 6:00 PM today at the 3rd floor of the Western Overseas Chinese YMCA to discuss the opening date and venue. The committee has also appointed Yu Binqi, Chen Linsheng, and Di Fei to attend and preside over the meeting.</p>

<p>— Xu Ping</p>
<p>The landlord's young daughter is preparing to transfer schools and asked me to recommend one. This put me in a difficult position, especially since her conditions were so strict, only being able to pay half tuition at most. Her academic performance and character were originally excellent, but she came up with this idea because her original school increased tuition.</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to refuse, so I agreed to go find a friend. He was a former classmate of mine who was very active. In the education field, he styled himself as "Old Ma," so I thought turning to him might have a chance of success.</p>
<p>His "affairs" kept him very busy. I went to see him twice, morning and evening, but couldn't catch him. According to his wife, he had gone to a school. I asked which school, but she didn't know. In fact, all schools were on holiday these days, and there was no office work in the mornings or evenings. I felt a bit lost.</p>
<p>The next morning, I visited again, and this time I was in luck. He hadn't gotten up yet. I used my status as an old classmate to barge straight into his bedroom and drag him out of dreamland. He told me that he hadn't gotten home until eleven o'clock yesterday, which was why he was sleeping so soundly.</p>
<p>I asked him, "Dancing?"</p>
<p>He smiled vaguely, with a sleepy look:</p>
<p>"No! Principal Huang was treating."</p>
<p>He was very interested in education, having studied in the education department at university. He and I originally took the university entrance exams together, but I later suspended my studies, and he also took a semester off. However, he is still continuing his studies. His life philosophy is quite unique compared to others. He advocates "activity." I don't know what "activity" really means, and he hasn't explained it clearly, but it probably focuses on social activities. He often said to me, "Old friend, you have to 'be active,' 'be active'! Being conservative is not the way!"</p>
<p>I told him my reason for coming, and he readily agreed.</p>
<p>"This little thing is no problem."</p>
<p>I asked him which middle school would be good for the transfer. He said:</p>
<p>"XX Middle School is also okay. Last semester, I introduced twenty senior high school students to them. Or XX Middle School is also no problem. We are currently in negotiations, and there are probably thirty or so students that can be introduced to them..."</p>
<p>After hearing what he said, I couldn't help but click my tongue in amazement and secretly praised him as being worthy of being an active member, the Old Ma of the education world.</p>
<p>I asked him – subconsciously:</p>
<p>"Do you get any benefits from introducing schools?"</p>
<p>He laughed and pointed to the suit on the wall.</p>
<p>"Old friend, you are really too naive. Would I do it without good benefits? Look, where do you think that came from, and this semester's university tuition?"</p>
<p>"Taking kickbacks? Isn't it the same as taking commissions?"</p>
<p>"Of course. To be honest, we are 'street runners,' and schools are equivalent to 'school stores.'"</p>
<p>He then very proudly told me: "By introducing twenty senior high school students to XX Middle School, the forty dollars of registration fees go into his pocket, and also, he got more than two hundred dollars from splitting the tuition and miscellaneous fees with the school at a two-eight ratio..."</p>
<p>"So what about the current negotiations?"</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"I have three major conditions, and they haven't responded yet..."</p>
<p>"What are the three major conditions?"</p>
<p>"First, I get to keep the registration fees of the thirty-odd people;</p>
<p>Second, the tuition fees of the thirty-odd people are split three-seven;</p>
<p>Third, most of them want to skip grades, and they are responsible for the student registration problem..."</p>
<p>I said with a smile:</p>
<p>"The first condition should be no problem, and the second condition should also be able to pass, because they are all problems of their school itself and not difficult to acknowledge. I'm afraid the third condition will be carefully considered. I heard that the local education authorities send people to check the student registration..."</p>
<p>He smiled again.</p>
<p>"They said that the first and third conditions are no problem and agreed to them. Only the second condition is that they insist on a two-eight split..."</p>
<p>I felt that it was beyond my expectations. I thought my thinking was too simple and not clever enough, but the reality was the opposite of what I imagined.</p>
<p>"How much can you earn if the negotiations are successful?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you calculate it, it will be more than that last time. It will probably be around four hundred dollars in total, right?"</p>
<p>I congratulated him:</p>
<p>"You are really capable, old friend. You truly deserve to be called brilliant and capable."</p>
<p>He was even happier:</p>
<p>"Old friend, you are worthy of being a scholar. Leave this matter to me. Consider it one of the additional conditions I'm asking of them."</p>
<p>I shook his hand:</p>
<p>"Then thank you, I'll wait for good news!"</p>
<p>We talked for a long time. He washed his face, and I was about to say goodbye, but he insisted on dragging me to eat refreshments. Since we were old classmates, I didn't stand on ceremony and went with him to the beef noodle shop across the street, where we ate potstickers before I went home.</p>
<p>I have discovered a miracle. Shouldn't it be a miracle in educational history? I feel uneasy in my heart!</p>
<h3 id="e81">Where Did It Go? <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>It was reported, "More than one million and one thousand nine hundred bags of foreign rice arrived in two months, which can supply the city's food for four months."</p>
<p>Looking at it and thinking about it, I can't help but sigh, "Where did it go?!"</p>
<p>If you say it's in the public warehouse, there's definitely no such "comfortable" thing. Empty trucks come in, and full trucks go out. "Where did it go?" Everyone is "clearly aware."</p>
<p>If you say it's in the rice shop, the clerk will answer that the "goods haven't arrived." So, "sell on the black market," one hundred and thirty old foreign coins per stone!</p>
<p>If you say it's in the homes of the poor, don't even talk about others. Even if I write it out, it's a bit "embarrassing" and "awkward"...</p>
<p>Then, where did it go in the end? The "guess" is that there are only two "destinations":</p>
<p>Those with lots of money; Those with black hearts. (Both below have the word "person"!)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Begonia <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Niao</p>
<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>After waiting another three or four minutes, a young woman in simple and plain clothes walked in with light and quick footsteps.</p>
<p>She and Begonia only glanced at each other briefly, and they both felt greatly surprised. However, relatively speaking, Luo Xiangqi's surprise was not as strong as Begonia's, because she had long heard Ai Baofan repeatedly praise Begonia's talent and artistry, and his various extraordinary actions. Otherwise, why would she be willing to come out and meet him? However, when she saw Begonia's simple and unadorned clothing and his handsome and upright demeanor, she couldn't help but feel very strange, almost not believing that he was a popular dan actor.</p>
<p>For Begonia, Luo Xiangqi's behavior, appearance, and clothing, were simply nothing like what he had expected. He had seen too many concubines of wealthy people, always with that same foxy and seductive aura. Even young mistresses like the wife of Manager Wang, who came from good families, still had some flippancy. But the Luo Xiangqi standing in front of him now was so steady and so elegant. Her beauty was indeed extreme, but her dignity was also extremely dignified!</p>
<p>When Begonia met people, he never bowed and scraped like ordinary actors. He always gave a shallow bow and that was it.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry that we came to disturb you, Elder!" After all, the matter was Begonia's own, so of course he should be the one to speak first. "Presumably, that Mr. Ji here has already told you everything, Madam. I wonder if Madam can give us some help?"</p>
<p>Not only was there no vulgarity in Begonia's speech, but it was completely like the tone of the upper class, even more refined than that of Garrison Commander Yuan. When Luo Xiangqi heard this, she couldn't help but reduce her usual aversion to actors by a lot.</p>
<p>"But I don't know what you want me to do?" She sat down properly on a small chair and asked very simply.</p>
<p>"Madam, those rogues are deliberately trying to swindle money from our boss. We only ask that you say a few good words to the military governor and send a card to the police station, and our matter will be easy to handle!" This time it was Zhao Si who spoke, and his tone was much coarser.</p>
<p>Xiangqi's eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p>
<p>"It would be best if you could write down all the details very concisely, so I can take it to Mrs. Hu to discuss. Perhaps she can give you some help."</p>
<p>Zhao Si rubbed his fat hands and suddenly felt helpless. (48)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Boss Wang's Abacus <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Although Boss Wang does not hold several positions concurrently, he is the owner and manager of two stores, one a hardware store and the other an electrical supplies store. Both made a lot of money last year, and it was precisely because they made a lot of money that Boss Wang suffered from insomnia for a month. You must be saying that I'm talking nonsense, how can making a lot of money cause insomnia?</p>
<p>The reason is this: Boss Wang's hardware store only had 40,000 in capital, but the God of Wealth helped him earn 180,000. Boss Wang was really happy and worried. He was happy that he earned so much, but worried about the excessive income tax and excess profits tax. According to a friend, at least 80,000 of the 180,000 profit would be taken away as excess profits tax (the tax rate for profits above 60 percent is 50 percent). This really scared Boss Wang. He thought that he had to find a proper solution no matter what, so he ran to friends in the east and relatives in the west. As a result, a solution came out: Boss Wang's hardware store should be declared liquidated.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Boss Wang has his own abacus. He has now re-prepared two hardware stores, and in order to avoid the shortcomings of last year, Boss Wang has put 200,000 on the books and told the outside world about a hardware store with an actual capital of 50,000. This is Boss Wang's abacus.</p>

<h3 id="e84">City Lights <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xin De</p>
<p>After Jacques changed his style, this "City Lights" should be considered the most outstanding. The first advantage of "City Lights" is that the story itself is moving. It writes about the experiences of three ordinary citizens in a big city, which is truly worthy of song and tears. At the same time, it boldly and thoroughly exposes the dark side of New York, this big city. The playwright clearly shows warm sympathy for the struggles of James Jacques and Ann Shirley Dan.</p>
<p>In the film, Jacques plays a hardworking and suffering car driver. Because he loves Ann Shirley Dan, whom he has known since childhood, he becomes a professional boxer, but unfortunately, he is sabotaged in a championship match and goes blind. Ann Shirley Dan likes to dance, and even sacrifices love for her "career." These factors deeply depict the arduous struggles of ordinary citizens in the city who have been threatened by life.</p>
<p>In addition to the two male and female protagonists, there is also Jacques' younger brother. Jacques saves money from his income to cultivate him into a promising musician. The last climax in the film is when Jacques is penniless and selling newspapers on the street, listening to his younger brother playing the city symphony on the radio. The moving melody and the audience's applause make him can't help but recall the past, and he feels all kinds of emotions. Just at this time, Ann Shirley Dan has returned gracefully and gently pats him on the shoulder. Although Jacques can't see anything, he already knows who it is.</p>
<p>Naturally, the two male and female protagonists performed the best in the entire play. Jacques portrayed the psychology of a small citizen who hopes to "climb up" very delicately, and vividly depicted that kind of stubborn and honest personality. Although Ann Shirley Dan is famous for her "um" accent, in this "City Lights," she is not only selling her "um" accent. Although due to the limitations of the plot, she doesn't have much opportunity to show it, her acting skills have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>Li Fak's direction has always been known for its delicacy. What is most worthy of special mention here is that he emphasized the atmosphere of the music to match the development of the plot, making it easier for the audience to be moved. On this point, I think anyone who has seen "City Lights" will feel the same as me?</p>
<h3 id="e85">Tan Modern Student Troupe's Twelve Talents <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yun Ying</p>
<p>Lei Xifu: The eldest brother of the first class of the Fu Liancheng troupe, but he has never had any luck in his life. The most popular area is only the corner of Tianjin. He came to Shanghai to perform once two years ago, and returned north with his feathers clipped. In terms of skill, he certainly has his merits, but his appearance is not beautiful, and his voice is not good. He is now a storyteller for the Fu troupe, performing intermittently, and his old age is pitiful.</p>
<p>Tan Fuying: Also a high-achieving student of the Fu troupe, with a handsome appearance and a bright and wide voice, possessing both high and low notes. He excels at operas that rely on singing, such as "Dingjun Mountain," "Zhu Lian Village," "Visiting Mother," and "Arresting and Releasing Cao." However, his performances in declining school plays such as "Hongyang Cave," "South Heavenly Gate," and "Qingfeng Pavilion" are not good. This may be due to his age. However, he was hired to renew his contract a few years ago and has repeatedly performed the play "Battle of Taiping." Few people can perform this play well in recent years. This son has performed it several times in a row, and it is said that the attendance rate is quite good. However, I have heard that Fuying has recently become arrogant, so I hope he can behave himself.</p>
<p>Tan Xiaopei: His voice has the strength of his father (Xinpei) but lacks gentleness, and seems to lack charm. His appearance is vulgar, and his figure is not beautiful. He was famous for plays such as "Plucking the Helmet String," "Wujia Slope," and "Hongyang Cave." His "singing" and "recitation" are quite disciplined. In recent years, with Fuying's independence, he has largely enjoyed his old age. Even if he occasionally puts on makeup and goes on stage, it is just a so-called occasional performance. There are really no two people in the pear garden who can enjoy the blessings of this gentleman.</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou: Also an outstanding talent of the Binqing troupe. When he was in the training class, his repertoire was quite orthodox, mostly following Shu Yan. Later, when he came south with Yanqiu, he was welcomed by many music lovers and highly praised. After returning to Ping, he also learned Ma opera, which has led to his singing style in recent years being neither Yu nor Ma, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<p>Chen Shaolin: The son of Chen Delin, he has some similarities to Yu. Shu Yan had high expectations for him at first and even personally gave him guidance. However, his singing style is still mostly taught by Zhu Jiakui, Shu Yan's current vocal coach. He is good at plays such as "Empty City Stratagem," "Scolding Cao," "Arresting and Releasing Cao," and "Visiting Mother." It is a pity that his voice is too narrow. If he could tune out his wide range, it would be even more beautiful. He also has acting skills in his movements and face, which is better than Baosen. If he is willing to work hard, his position will surpass that of Shaolou and he will become a strong rival to Baosen.</p>
<p>Chi Shigong: The most recent outstanding talent from the Fu troupe, with a large repertoire, proficient in both civil and military roles. He came to Shanghai with Wu Suqiu to perform in the renewal troupe. His appearance and stage presence are both good, and his movements and stage steps are extremely regular because he has just come out of the training class. As for the singing style, it is mostly official, and his voice is also narrow, the same as Shaolin and Xiaobo. I recently heard that he will be hired by Huangjin and will come south with Li Shifang. The matter has been publicized for a long time, and the date of meeting is probably not far away.</p>
<p>As for the older people such as Wang Fengqing and Guan Dayuan, they are already gone. Even people like Wang Wenyuan, Xing Weiming, Gao Boling, and Fan Junhong have not yet come to Shanghai to perform, and due to space limitations, I will not go into details. The order of the twelve talents in this manuscript is purely based on the excellence of their art and their qualifications. I hereby declare the above. (End)</p>

<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Your striving power gradually changes the quantity of the environment in an invisible way. The change in quantity increases day by day. From the outside, you may not feel it at all; but when it reaches a considerable level, the environment suddenly changes, becoming a new environment that is beneficial to you.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Where in Life Do We Not Meet</p>
<p>Xu Jing replied, "As far as I know, Zhou Yuji, the general of Datong, is well-versed in tactics and proficient in martial arts, and can be called a hero." Zhang Cangqiu smiled and said, "Those who are capable should be like this. You and I should encourage ourselves to become heroes in the future, inscribing our names on Yanran Mountain and leaving monuments on Xian Mountain, so that we will not betray this life." Xu Jing felt that Zhang Cangqiu's conversation was both rough and elegant, and he did not seem to be completely a military man, which made him even more surprised. And hearing that he had great ambitions to become a hero, he knew that he was a second Qiu Ran, and was feeling apprehensive in his heart. Zhang Cangqiu suddenly pointed his hand towards the wall behind him and said, "Is that a treasured sword? May I have the honor of viewing it?" Xu Jing smiled and said, "I have not succeeded in studying, nor have I succeeded in learning swordsmanship. Although I have a sharp sword, I am afraid I will not live up to it." After saying that, he went to take down the treasured sword, returned to the table, and quickly pulled the sword out of its sheath. Suddenly, a cold light flickered before his eyes, chilling his skin. Zhang Cangqiu quickly stood up and said, "Good sword, good sword!" Taking it into his hands, he saw the two words "Red Phoenix" engraved on the hilt, which must be something from before the Tang and Song Dynasties. He wondered which hero of the past had passed it down. He then asked, "Where did you get these two treasured swords? Congratulations, congratulations! Are they family heirlooms?" Xu Jing smiled and said, "I have already said that my father was a scholar, and my ancestors were all Confucian scholars. How could there be a treasured sword passed down?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Then where did you get this treasured sword? Could it be that someone gave it to you?" Xu Jing shook his head and said, "No. This happened two years ago. I remember it was during the Qingming Festival, my father's tomb was in Dengjiaqiao in the countryside. That place is a desolate village, with a small river flowing around it, and there are very few residents, but there are many tombs, it is a ghost market. I was ordered by my old mother to go to sweep the tomb. I originally wanted to rush back, but who would have thought that the weather was very hot that day, and dark clouds covered the sky. A gale rose and brought a heavy rain, preventing me from returning home. I had no choice but to sit in the house of the villager guarding the tomb. When the clouds dispersed and the rain cleared, it was already late. I felt very bored alone, so I bought wine and drank alone, and talked to the villager about the conditions in the countryside. After eating dinner at dusk, I was about to go to bed when I accidentally looked out the window. The night was very dark, and there was no moon, but not far to the east, there was a white light rushing up to the sky. I saw it and felt a little strange, so I asked the villager. The villager replied, "This white light is always there, and we have all seen it for nearly a year. Some people think it is a monster, and some people think it is an auspicious omen. Especially in the dark night, it can be seen most clearly. Sometimes it flickers, and sometimes it is faint and small. Tonight it is even brighter. No wonder Young Master is surprised." I asked him again, "Where does this white light come from?" (5)</p>

<p>The Min Hua Company's "The Children of the World" is scheduled to begin filming on the 26th of this month. "The Children of the World" is another major production by Min Hua after "Confucius" and is a work that thousands of viewers have been eagerly awaiting for a long time. Although the film has not yet begun filming, the audience is already looking forward to it.</p>
<p>In fact, Min Hua has indeed not relaxed its work on "The Children of the World" for a single day. However, because of the rigorous attitude of the production, there are many preparatory works that need to be done, such as the revision and translation of the script, the selection of actors, and other aspects of work. Therefore, they have been working hard in the background, and only recently have they completed the preparatory work and set the filming schedule.</p>
<p>The director of "The Children of the World," Fleck, and his wife, are famous directors in Europe with a long history. Great directors such as William Dieterle and stars such as Marlene Dietrich all came from their hands. It is natural that they are able to carry out the directing work happily, so "The Children of the World" was originally scheduled to be co-directed by Fei Mu, but now, due to Fei Mu's busy work, he will only serve as the production director. In addition, Sima Yingcai has been appointed as the deputy director of the film.</p>
<p>"The Children of the World" is about to begin filming, which should be good news for the film industry in the isolated island. - If 1941 can be called the year when costume films came to the fore, then the foundation should be laid by Min Hua's "The Children of the World" and the "Family" produced by the National Federation with the full efforts of all its directors and actors.</p>

<p>(General answer to Shen Qianghua, Lin Wenrong, Wang Zhongbiao, and seven others with excessively small genitalia) Formal physicians can treat them all. Injections of Indremon and other male hormones are also quite effective.</p>
<p>(General answer to Wang Fugen, Qin Kunong, Chen Yinyin, and nine others with premature gray hair) The reason for gray hair is a lack of certain pigments. According to recent medical knowledge, vitamin X is effective; but it is not sold in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Ms. Xiao Jianxia asks) I am eighteen years old, unmarried, and my breasts are gradually increasing in size and have reached their peak. What is the best way to treat them? Also, my brother is fourteen years old. He accidentally injured his genitals while playing with them and is in severe pain. Please advise?</p>
<p>(Answer) Large breasts are beneficial to the body and do not need to be treated. Your brother can use heat packs. It is best to let him take care of it himself and not bother his sister.</p>
<p>(Mr. Zhang Tingyong asks) I am fifteen years old and six feet one inch tall. My classmates call me telephone pole or Indian, which is very embarrassing. Is there any good way to deal with this?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is no way. You can call them Wu Dalang, short melon.</p>
<p>(Ms. Zhou asks) I am twenty years old, unmarried, and my period is irregular, differing by a week. I also have a lot of leukorrhea and often have headaches. After taking exams at school, I am sure to be sick for several days, which greatly hinders my future. Please advise?</p>
<p>(Answer) See a doctor immediately.</p>
