<p>合衆社十九日華盛頓電　來栖特使與野村大使昨日再度與國務卿赫爾會商、事後野村大使告人、渠覺「仍有希望」獲得圓滿結果、野村大使赴會之初踏入國務院時、對擁擠之記者羣云、「報章何以如是悲觀、吾人至為樂觀、汝輩美人素為直前無畏之人士、汝輩腦際何以不離戰爭」、野村大將偕來栖與赫爾氏會談、逹兩小時又四十五分鐘、赫爾吿報界云、日本外交代表如吿渠以彼等有繼續談判之準備、則渠當於星期主繼續談話、又言渠信所談之事、當由日代表轉吿東京、在談判繼續以前、日方特使殊希望能獲得日本政府之反響、日方兩大使步出國務院時、精神均甚愉快、赫爾稱、現時所能言者、厥為目前所談者乃普通之考慮、而非特別之細則、又稱、談話乃係試探性質、並未進入正式外交談判之階段、渠拒不言雙方曾否提出解決遠東一切問題之總辦法、亦拒不言談話是否有足以令人滿意之進展、詢及曾否就若干點互相取得同意時、赫爾云、渠不能回答此問題、殆恐予人以足以誤解之情報故也、詢及日本兩使是否似亟望避免日美戰爭時、赫爾稱、此問題最妙莫如直接向兩特使詢問、來栖氏吿記者云、渠寗願赫爾氏發表正式公報、俾不致同時有兩種不同之文吿發出、有人吿野村氏謂彼等此次談話時間之長久、足以打破國務院之紀錄時、野村氏稱、「此殆因余不諳英語、」觀察家認為赫爾氏於解釋美國之政策時、曾明白昭示日使、謂日本如能改變其外交政策一如美國所言者、則日本將能因之獲利云、</p>
<p>合衆社十九日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨稱、渠信即將與來栖特使及野村大使晤面、惟渠並未與彼等作任何確定之約期、詢及其他關於日本之問題時總統吿記者稱、渠無消息可吿、來　及野村昨日會與國務卿赫爾晤面、按彼等曾於星期一與羅斯福總統及國務鄕赫爾會商頗久、彼等兩氏昨日步出國務院時均甚愉快云，</p>
<p>合衆社十九日華盛頓電　此間權威方面本日透露、日美談話之情形英國完全知悉、國務卿赫雨昨日參加會議幾逹三小時、其後英駐美大使坎培爾爵士曾往訪赫爾、可見英國對於談話之關切、中國大使胡適博士亦於昨日會見赫爾、可見關於日美談話之一般問題、華方大概亦完全知悉、</p>
<p>合衆社十九日重慶電權威方面本日宜稱、此間華人方面認為東條首相之三項原則、乃對美國之公開挑戰、加之島田及其他日議員又激烈攻擊美國、故相信來栖之使命必定失敗、外長郭泰　及其他中國政府領袖曾稱、被等相信最近東京島田攻擊美國之後、日美殊難獲致協定、因東京方面之攻擊、已斷送日本說服美國之希望云、此間華人對於日本議會之演說、皆無動於中、消息靈通方解釋謂、「日本現時似正向美國政府及人民說明　日本與美國對太平洋問題不能調和、吾人確信日人會有效的證明此一點」、消息靈通方面指出、日方雖尚無在最近之將來進攻　桂之象、但中美巳　緊準備歡迎日軍來犯、大批華軍現正嚴陣以待、美國之志願空軍亦已作技術上之準備、俾能立刻作戰、</p>
<p>所謂日外交三原則美報一致斥為狂妄</p>
<p>合衆社十九日紐約電　紐約及華盛頓之報紙昨日對於來栖此行之成功，極表懷疑、各報評論家一致斥責東條英機首相在議會所發表太平洋和平之三原則、「紐約泰晤士報」稱、「日本此種條件實屬荒唐、日本之首相無能希望突國因日本之要求而改變其傳統之政策」、「紐約先驅論壇報」社評之標題為「東鄉與日本和平」、據稱、了解日本之「眞正意向」乏唯一確切答覆、為和平之觀點各有不同、某種和平對於吾人實較戰爭更為可憎恨、此即為亞洲之實况也、日本愈相信其任務之公正、其新秩序之思想與美國有秩序之世界之思想愈形無法協調「、「華盛頓郵報」於評論東條及東鄉之演說之社評中稱、「日本準備對於美國所要求之讓步作某種交換、殊未見何等跡象、反之、日本堅持對美國提出等於最後通牒之耍求、倘日本願意一顯顏色、彼可得之」云、</p>
<p>路消社特派員十九日華盛頓電　日方島田昨在議會發表簡直主張日本立即對美開戰之敵意的言論　、此間因以發生之反響、殆可以驚奇一詞形容之、島田於贊助指實　國為目前歐戰禍根之決議案時發生怪論、而星期一日日相東條與外相東鄉亦皆發同樣激烈言論、故此間一般印象、以為日政府亟欲自毀其對美使命、而來栖可謂為携有外表和平而內載磚塊的使命之特使、惟熱知日人及其舉動之觀察家則覺其所發言論、僅為旨在攫取最好的交涉結果之大規模虛聲恫嚇而已此間一般態度可於斯克利浦斯嚴報紙評論家克拉泊氏之言見之、其言曰東京言論直要求美國完全拋棄其政策、而聽令日本任意行動耳、設來栖果能將此種要求、成為和平的解決，則來栖不獨為政治家、且為魔術家矣、東條言論如能代表日本之最後談判地位、則美日政府間除彼此齟齬外、決無妥洽之可能云、「巴爾狄摩太陽報」稱、來栖在其肘論開始時，其政府巳予以可疑的背景、而東條之第三期望、即第三國應設法阻止歐戰波及太平洋者、尤為笑談、實則將此期望化為事實之責任厥在日本、蓋日本乃軸心國之一、且為在亞洲作戰多年之國也、以言東條之第二點、則日本改過自新時、對日貿易將自然恢復常態、至於東條之第一點、則美國堅持其不承認以武力造成的現狀變更之原則、如來栖為東條、此種期望所拘束、則其討論必無結果云、</p>
<p>倫敦注視談判進展認太平洋安危所繫</p>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電　太平洋局勢安危、刻在未定之天、故英政府現以深切興趣注視華盛頓舉行之美日談話、而英美間現仍維持密切接觸、日首相與外相言論在此之一般反響、極不美滿、日本議會且通過仇視美國之激烈議案、致華盛頓談話與太平洋和平之象殊欠樂觀、英國報紙如「泰晤士報」「孟却斯德指導報」等之社論、皆竭力駁斥東條與東鄉所發關於德義日三國盟約之言論、指為妨害解決之可能性、「約克夏郵報」論東條三點、其言可代表一般輿情之趨向、謂此種條件如接受、則英美政府直放棄其政策之基本要點矣、「新聞紀事報」指東條第一條件乃狂妄要求、大多數英報皆謂東條三點、如為華盛頓談話憑以進行之基本原則、則來栖來命之失敗必無疑義、美政府將有充分理由、遺來栖即日乘輪返日而向日政府聲明美國不欲在威脅下進行談判矣、「每日電聞」言及泰國謂、日本陸電與空軍集於越南北境者、現有西南兩路進兵直向泰國邊界之說、「每日郵報」謂、蘇聯地位苟不惡化、則日本未必挑戰、今華盛頓之談話、不過為日本拖延時日以觀究竟之策略耳、「孟却斯德指導報」警吿太平洋列强勿蹈從前俄國不事準備、致遭日本倐然攻擊之覆轍、今太平洋局勢雖可作悲觀、但英政府之政策迄未稍變即一方面抱和平解決之希望、一方面作應付事變之準備是也、</p>
<p>中國為反侵略犧牲信美國必能維護公道</p>
<p>路透社十九日重慶電　華宇各報雖皆信美國必將維護國際公道與中國主權、但有數報因東條首相旣在議會提出無理之要求、而美仍與來栖談判、故頗以為異、大公報社論曰、來栖旣堅主增固日本與軸心國之關係、而來栖且為代表日本手簽三國盟約者、乃羅期福總統猶在白宮接見之、誠異事也、以手成三國聯盟者與手成大西洋憲章者竟彼此握手而坐談、實屬令人難以置信、吾人固完全信任羅總統人格之完備、與美國政策之堅決、但不得不承認白宮所演特別之戯劇、實足引起諸反侵略民族間奇異之反動、甚至將發生若干疑懼云、</p>
<p>路透社十九日華盛頓電　參院外委會委員民主黨議員披伯氏頃語新聞記者日、倘使大平洋之戰事果為抵抗日本騷擾之代價、則戰事必將發生、如日本願望和平、應即停止侵略、並退出中國、美國對於任何建築於無辜不幸者之骨格而洗以鮮血之所謂秩序者、決不予以默認、吾人已目擊彼等在地球大部份之殺戮與蹂躪矣、紐約唯一著論批評美日關係之「每日新聞報」則希望戰事得能倖免、各無綫電評論家皆認最近所擬定之日本和平為不可思議、</p>
<p>談判前途成敗難言日方自稱完成準備</p>
<p>台衆社十九日東京電　外相東鄉茂德昨日有請求其說明東條英機將軍之三原則、是否嘗由來栖三郎轉逹華盛頓者、東鄉對之極端保持絨默、中島在下院預算委員會中詢以首相東條之三原則、與來栖之使命有何關係、東鄉稱、來栖係被遣派往華盛頓、襄助野村大使賡續談判、渠謂政府未予來栖以任何特別新訓令、因談判已在華盛頓進行多時矣、東鄉叉稱、來栖氏必已得悉此三原則、惟渠拒絕中島之請求、未肯予以闡明、渠於答覆關於華府談判前途及與三强公約條文第三項關係之問題時稱、「談判之前途無法預測、至其與三强公約之關係、則應視局勢之發展而闡明之、余殊不願答覆此種假定之問題」、中島提出國防是否巳與日本人民同樣準備應付最惡劣之變化一問題、東條首相乃以陸軍省大臣資格答稱、「陸軍已充分準備應付任何局勢之變化」、海相島田繁太郎亦稱、「海軍業已完成一切必要之準備」云、</p>
<p>合衆社十九日東京電　陸軍情報局之富永少校昨晚在電臺廣播、又斥責美國發動對日之ABCD包圍、國家主義派之「國民新聞」大加登載富永少校之演詞稱、英屬馬來·荷印·印度·緬甸·及中國實際上均為美國之傀儡、「國民新聞」載其演詞稱、日本此後對於ABCD各國之敵意行動之態度、自有所限、因此余促請國人準備對付此種局面」云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c29">美日談判析觀 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>日特使來栖抵美之後，已與美當局兩度會晤，關於接洽的經過情形，雙方都守着神秘的緘默；現在正式談判尚未進行，其前途成敗，固難驟加斷定，而縱觀連日各方反應，似乎對此什九都抱悲觀態度，這一情勢，是値得加以深切檢討的</p>
<p>美日間關於太平洋的爭執，並不是新的問題，其起源當回溯於二十餘年以前，而在上次歐戰之後的十餘年間尚能彼此相安者，主要由於在華盛頓會議中雙方都同意於保障中國獨立與領土完整的原則。自從九一八事變，日方進佔東北，九國公約的基本原則首遭蝕損損，間接也就是造成了美日間新衝突的起因。十年以來，兩國關係張弛不一，但日方在遠東以武力造成的情勢無疑是美日之間最主要的暗礁。中日戰爭爆發而後，美日關係更形尖銳，雖然美當局格於孤立派的牽制，不能根據共一貫信念從事於維護條約尊嚴及遏阻侵略罪行的舉措，而其所一貫奉行的「不承認主義」已足說明美國對於遠東事變所提出的異議與保留態度。及至日方揭　「東亞新秩序」口號，繼續進而作南進的經營，並與軸心締結軍事同盟，乘歐戰機會以擴展要挾英美，於是美日關係乃迅呈惡化，而尤以今夏美國之對日實行凍結資金實施禁運逹到尖銳的頂點。其間日方未嘗不屢以緩和美國關係為急務，在阿部內閣與第二第三兩度近衛內閣當中都曾積極策動以冀獲得妥協，但卒因雙方根本見解無法接近而迄無效果可言。到此次來栖使美，世人皆以最後談判視之，在美日雙方亦復各自從事於萬一的準備，這一萬目睽睽的緊張情勢，殆為太平洋亘古以來所未有；時至此際，美方一貫的堅强立塲業經華盛頓當局一再聲言不容變更，而在日本方面，迄今亦復絕無改弦更張之象，而以對華問題為尤甚，雙方見解，現已判明除却保持太平洋和平一點而外，幾乎完全背道而馳，於此可見世人對此之表示悲觀，絕不是一種主觀的成見。</p>
<p>那麽，來栖此行。是否確如一部人士的觀察，除却拖延時日而外亳無意義可言呢？客覜事實也許如此，但在日當局雖日來極呈劍拔弩張之象，却並非對於來栖此行無所所待。適當來栖在美京與赫爾會晤的同時，是首相外相在日臨時議會中關於施政方針與外交政策的報吿，曾引起了英美一致的反感，尤共是日議員島田俊雄於十八日代表衆院各派所提的完遂國策決議的提案說明與該項提案的決議，一味譴責英美，且把一切責任都加到美當局身上，並希望日政府以遂行戰爭目的之方針從事一切，更為正在初步接洽中之赫爾——野村來栖會談投一暗影。這些固然是一種威脅，同時也是一種對外的運用，共眞正値得注意的到是東條所提出的三項原則。在這三原則中：第一項的「第三國不得妨碍日本解決中國事變之方針」與第二項的「各國不得對日作軍事威脅且須解除經濟封鍍恢復經濟上之正常關係」者是日方主要要求，而第三項的「防止歐戰擴及遠東」只是陪襯。來栖對美所提條件是否與此相同不可知，但可信這三項一定是日本對美以至對其他民治國家進行談判時的主要根據。在任何人都可看出此等要求適與美國不承認武力變更現狀及「反對以武力在國境外施行侵略與威脅」的立塲背道而馳，而且有如其第一項，也絕不是美當局對日進行談判中所能加以考慮的問題。然而在日方自己看來，這並不是沒有提供相當的讓步。第一，關於三國盟約義務問題，並未包括在日本三一項目的之內，在東條演說中也對此，幾乎全未提及，這無異暗示日本在必要時對於盟約義務可以解除。軸心關係可以脫離，其第三項的「極力防止歐戰擴大波及遠東」也可以解釋為日本不準備在遠東替軸心作戰的意義。第二，關於南進問題，東條亦以「日本對南方之和平進展」一語輕輕提過，並未强調對南洋的要求，這自然並不能驟卽認為日當局的準備停止南進，但却未必不是以此為換取美國讓步的條件。統觀東條所宣示政策的全部，可以說他是針對着美國重視歐局與關懷南洋的觀點而加以運用、而在另一方面則要求美國以至其他民治國停止援助中國，解除在遠東的應變凖備與對日方的經濟封鎖。猶憶當東條就職之初發表政綱，首先提出了「對華戰事獲得勝利之結束」，現在與其在議會中所發表的政策對照來看：大致可以看出來栖赴美所進行的談判，固然是為了緩和美日關係，在骨子裏却仍以「解決中國事變」為主要目標。</p>
<p>美日關係惡化至此，自然是三國同盟與南進政策所引起來的後果，而中日間的戰事與日本向亞洲大陸擴展的慾望則為其最根本的原因，除非美國根本改變其二十餘年來對遠東的一貫政策與近數年間不斷宣示的反侵略立塲，可以斷言建立在東條三原則之上的任何對美談判斷無成功可能，日本的討價還價與再讓步固屬不無可能，但就日方朝野種種動態看來，却絕難與美國獲得觀點上的一致，卽使最多勉强得到局部妥協，也只是拖延時日，却無從根本緩和太平洋的危機。</p>

<h3 id="c31">川江行　（一） <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 季生</p>
<p>悠悠　水，無風也生漪漣。疑是水皺，莫非爾錢？今日，可是晴和的春天。</p>
<p>行吧！地勢逼迫你向前。莫怕行程遙阻！莫怕路途簸顚！平闊無際的大海，緊接着流盡的平原。那裏有你的同道，掀起了波濤與天連。</p>
<p>看慣了平緩的流水。去歲西行，汽車飛駛在贛東丘陵裏，一條條帶微漩的河澗，掠過眼簾，不由得我要這樣歌謳着。</p>
<p>在寗都待車，有暇到四郊散步。就是這樣的一條溪水，吸引我倚在柳樹旁獃看了一個多鐘點。心頭老是有種奇特的感覺：這是一幕似會相識的圖案，為何不能將它具體說明呢？靈感終於被我捕獲了：啊！好一匹飄蕩不定的上品皺綢！細碎的波紋，閃耀着絲樣的油光；許多曲綫圈成的漩渦，便是皺綢上的雲彩。聰明的圖案家，已先我賞識到這幅自然美景，將它應用做絲綢ｒ　花紋了</p>
<p>來到蜀中，江流更湍念了。一年餘，往返東西川兩次。趕不到輪船汽車班次的時候，便搭過好幾回木船。在緩慢中，親切的欣賞到航行川江的滋味。當然，一幅幅飄蕩得或急或徐的皺綢式的江水，是我凝視，遐想，消磨時間的對象。在它每個飄蕩　速的地段（便是蜀中所稱謂的（灘因石子壅塞或江底坡度太大而形成），發出「洪」「洪」的響聲，顯出巨大的動力，更使我驚心動魄讃嘆不巳。</p>
<p>川江裹各段綸船來往所需的日期，大致下行為上行的一半；票價便照這樣訂定的。可是這種比例，不適用於木船。下水，你還可以預測抵逹日期。如果你要探詢一個上行船夫幾時可到目的地，他的答語一定簡單而且令人不愉快·「行船莫問路」！的確，在川江裹行駛上水船，困難太多了。除了已知的困難，還有些不可預測的阻擾與危險。水漲了，灘流急，船不拉上灘；水落了，灘水見底，一不當心就會擱淺。有時　纜正拉得緊緊的要過一條急流的灘，忽然　纜斷了，這時的危險就難以想像。即使萬幸，掌舵的操持得當，免於沉覆，船也得隨沒下流，不知何時才能再接上牽纜，回到原來的地位。一隻上水船，為了等待天晴，在小村落旁停泊數日，不算希奇的事。這時，就是性情最緩慢的人，都會有「蜀道難」的感嘆。</p>
<p>中秋過後，路過宜賓搭輪船到樂山。第二天船離健為十里。輪機跟一道斜坡式的灘小搏鬥了兩小時，不能前進一步。在船長宣佈前進失敗後不久，我們新奇的旅行便開始了。</p>
<p>糾合九位旅客，共包一條小木船。為要迅速，言明男客須得常常上岸步行。這個對於我，除新奇外無反感。脫下沈重的夾衣，越過鵝卵石灘，走上靑草地。秋風微拂着單薄的衫褲，感覺異常爽健。不到數百步，一條紅色小溪橫在路前，沒有渡河的工具。發默了好一會，一個個祇好步着船夫的後塵，涉水而過。這是我第一次在川中跣足行路。當一雙光脚揷入血紅的發閃光的細砂裏，感覺多麼柔軟，舒適。「過河！哈，哈…」，「回到自然」的電影開始放映了。</p>

<p>— 孫傑人</p>
<p>天有不測風雲</p>
<p>咱們經理的五十生辰不在遠了，同事們都算着送壽禮：有有送幛子的，有送銀盾的，也有送禮券五十元或是一百元的……我呢？糟糕。</p>
<p>這難題叫人悶納了大半天，但最後，終於給我想起了個老李來，他是我在上海，唯一的同鄉而朋友了，並且，聽說他近來混得很不錯·「別管成不成，反正不費什麽事，且去試試再說罷！」我這末的想着，便打定了主意。</p>
<p>星期六的下午，我趁着空閒沒事，便找出我那身唯一的法蘭絨洋服穿了，一逕去找他去。</p>
<p>我到他家時，湊巧他正在家裏，見了我，多遠便高呼着「老孫」，迎出房來。</p>
<p>他的家是一間挺漂亮，挺氣概的前樓，朝南，窗子很多，陳設又摩登，比起我那又黑又臭的擱樓來，眞有天壤之別了，而且，我記得前次來的時候，那些傢具似乎沒有現在的這末新，這末好，墻壁上也似乎沒有像現在那樣，漆着藍的漆。</p>
<p>「老孫，你覺得我這屋子收拾得還像樣嗎？」老李見我呆呆的打量着他的房間，便笑喀嘻地問着說，一邊給我送來一枝紙烟。</p>
<p>「唔，唔，那個，那個……摩登，摩登極了！」</p>
<p>「蹩脚香烟，三五牌，請將就吸着罷！」老李很得意地指了指他手中的烟捲說。</p>
<p>「那裏，那裏，三五牌還不好嗎？嘿，嘿，你太客氣了！」我想說我平時只吸烟屁股的「十景牌」，但，終於忍住了口。</p>
<p>老李的那身畢挺的洋服，老是一閃一閃的在發着亮，「一定是那個什麽…什麽克丁…克丁做的罷！」我心裏想着，不禁對自己的那身唯一」，起了一陣羞澀。實在說，這原是我十二年前做的衣服呢。</p>
<p>「近來聽說你老哥很得意，不知是在那裏發財哪？」我檢這句話說了，想早些言歸正傳。</p>
<p>「發什麽財，還不是在那××銀行幹撈什子的庶務！不過時常囤些貨，將就混日子罷了！」老李滿不在乎的答着，對「囤些貨」三偭字，却說得特別重，似乎在表示着他的得意。</p>
<p>「唔，唔，唔，那很好，那很好，」我嘴上雖附着腔，但肚裹却已灌飽了氣。</p>
<p>「這日子呢子除非沒錢就別說，要小然的話，不趁機撈他幾錢這才寃呢！」老李更高興的說着，我聽得幾乎氣炸了肺；依脾胃得撒腿跑，但經理的那份禮少了可不是玩意賬，只能耐着鳥氣再說。</p>
<p>「要不是那次的三白包雙馬傷了我啊，嘿！嘿！老孫。我少說也可多幾個卓字頭在手裹了　唉！他忽然異常懊傷的　着氣說，我沒接嘴，我覺得該是和他來個「乾脆」的好；他講的那些話，和我全不對個勁兒。</p>
<p>「我今天夾你府上是……嘿，嘿，是……有些小事的！」我掙扎了半天，才掙出了口，但滿腮巴子已漲得緋紅。</p>
<p>「是什麽事呢？」老李很驚異的問。</p>
<p>「因為要送經理一筆禮，手頭不够，所以想……想向你暫借一借……」說實話我雖窮，向人借錢，可還是生平第一次。</p>
<p>「原來這事，你何不早說，要多少數目呢？」老李很隨便的問着，一手已在褲袋裏掏出了皮夾。</p>
<p>「大概有三十塊錢也就够了　」我對他這漂亮的舉動，覺着很可愛，於是連忙打起笑臉，應着，叉仲了伸豎着三個指頭的右手。</p>
<p>「三十塊嗎？喏，這兒！」他抽出三張十元的鈔票來塞到我的手裏。</p>
<p>「費心你啦，老李哥！我接過錢來藏了，一面便對他說：「我下月一號準還的！」</p>
<p>「不，不，不，老孫！三十塊錢的事，也値得鬧這一手嗎？你太瞧不起人了，要是你眞預備還，那我不給！」</p>
<p>「那怎麼成呢？那…那…眞太對不起你了……」</p>
<p>「多講什麼！拿去用是了，唔，我還要上維納斯呢！」他毫不在意地說着，隨手將皮夾裏的一大疊鈔票拿出來，點了點，又看了看手錶，便穿上了大衣。</p>
<p>「好的，那末多謝，多謝，我也要回家去了！」我知道見機行事。</p>
<p>「還謝什麽！我們一同走罷！今天還得買五百元舞票去捧我的莉莉的塲去呢！」他又給了我一支紙烟，我們便一同走出他的屋子。</p>
<p>在馬路上，我們分手了，他跳上一輛人力車，說了聲「再會」而去，我便懷了一腔勝利似的情緒，踏着快步歸家。</p>
<p>這樣我就很寫意的過了那難關——經理的壽期，但心裹却老有些　囌……老李人雖是不錯，可是，幹那個「囤」的一手，却總不是話啊！</p>
<p>日子很快的過去，一個半月之後，我忽然接到了一封信，拆開看了一遍，不禁使我愕然大半天，這信正是老李寫來的，但內容却是這樣子：——</p>
<p>傑人仁兄大鑒：</p>
<p>一別匝月，頗為意念，弟前次與兄相晤時，是一人，今則又另是一人矣！嗚呼！言之慘然，蓋弟近來投機慘敗，而所囤之貨，又價格狂落，此次所受打擊之重大，竟使弟傾家之外，復背債纍纍，且近日生活已發生困難，因思兄前次尙向弟移挪法幣三十元，可否立即　還，並於可能範圍內，請為弟多等數十金以救弟燃眉之急也。望諒弟苦衷，俯諾所請，則恩莫大焉。</p>
<p>此請</p>
<p>大安　　弟李××上</p>
<p>「唉！唉！道眞是天有不測風雲，人有……人有什麽的，想不起來了，但，這可不是嗎？我早說這「囤」啊「囤」的終得不到好結果！而我這三十塊不是也終於白歡喜了一塲嗎？唉！唉！」我嘆着謹着的只能叉我出那套「唯一」來，另外湊上一件布袍子，一齊拿着，往走熟了的那家當舖走去。</p>

<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>「四哥，對不起，請你多照應！……」「王老板，是我的不好，你老千萬別生氣！……每天晚上，秋海棠幾乎總要向各人賠小心，認不是，有時候還得把自己的點心錢省下三四天來，買些糕餅香烟，分給他那些同行們吃，藉以表示他心裏的感激。</p>
<p>然而這些人也祗能做到不傾軋他的地步，此外便愛莫能助了！</p>
<p>霎眼又逢到禮拜天了。禮拜天，戲院子裏是照例要唱日夜兩塲的，雖然白天唱的是老戲，武塲沒有像本戲那樣的劇烈；但，不巧得很，這紅舞台裹除了那正樑武生以外，還有三四個很有名的武生，所以唱老戲的日子，武戲至少總要排三齣或四齣，經不起中間加一齣「拿高登」或「惡虎村」一類的重頭戲，當武行的人也就够累了。</p>
<p>「張老板，今兒想懇求你幫一個忙！」日戲停　的時候，秋海棠獨自走到張銀財面前去，小心下氣的說「方才唱到四杰村的時候，我就覺得有些頭暈，晚上能不能吿一天假，讓我回去歇息歇息？」</p>
<p>張銀財的一對金魚眼先在他臉上掃了一掃。（二六七）</p>

<h3 id="c92">霧重慶概述 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 彥文</p>
<p>（按）「霧重慶」又名「鞭」，係宋之的最新名作。曾在香港重　等地先後獻演，萬人空巷，一致讃美。尤以劇旨嚴正，題材現實。現上海劇藝社由洪謨導演，將繼「北京人」後上演。</p>
<p>生活的鞭策事變後，華北靑年首先走上了流亡的路。大學生沙大千和妻林卷妤，同學老艾和萬世修便是流亡的一羣。廿七年冬天他們到了重慶，大家都是赤手空拳，而物價一天一天高漲，萬世修終於做了「相面先生　來養活他自己，而卷妤因為小時同學徐曼（現改名苔莉）的幫助，與趙肅夫婦合開一個小館子。苔莉的行為有點不正當，和一個當主任的有錢人袁慕容眷戀着，可是為了要活命，也祇得不冉顧慮這許多，但這件事是大千最反對。</p>
<p>轉變　小館子開張後生意很興隆，五個月淨賺了四千七百多元。可是就為了做生意太容易賺錢，致使他們在權利與義務之間起了暗爭，一天趙肅與顧客為一點小事誤會，叉惹起軒然大波。這樣一來，彼此都牢騷滿腹，慕容乘機引誘大千歇手，勸他到香港去做「坐地客」，更容易弄到錢。於是小館子決定關門了。但卷好因為妹妹家棣的啓示，覺得自己應該參加新中國的建設工作才是。</p>
<p>香港歸來　大千在香港半年，做着販賣違禁品的生意賺了不少錢回到重慶，判若兩人，而卷妤呢，在工作的熱潮裹也另外是一個人了。苔莉依然故我，想到前途，總有點渺茫，這時家棣訓練期滿耍到前方去了，苔莉偶然好玩地說耍同去，那知慕容却逼着她走，但卷好因為想送寒衣捐而去前方，大千却不允許這種自私自利的矛盾，顯然已經存在他們幾個人之間。</p>
<p>病了　大千是完全變了過慣奢侈的生活，又得了花柳病，於是卷妤也被傳染了，老艾的肺病，受過分刺激也加重起來，病重後他悔悟的說：「大家在苦難時期，都選了輕便的路走，這結果是當然的」，慕容在卷妤受刺激後，便賣弄殷勤。這時他托世修帶一個三十五萬港幣的存摺，赴港的飛機票一張給她，希望一同去香港，經不住世修的敦勸，卷好終於答應，到香港去醫病。</p>
<p>兩條路　「卷好為甚麽要到香港去」？這又是慕容的陰謀，結果卷妤把存摺交還苔莉，毅然的出走，慕容後來又想再施故技，可是這時候的大千和苔莉旣悔悟自己不該上慕容當，復鑒於世修因為無正業的被逐出境，老艾的病死醫院，家棣的憤而再往前方，痛悔自己確是如老艾所說的走錯了路，而覺得像家棣這樣的靑年，在非常時期中，才有無限的前途。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Preliminary Washington Exploratory Talks; U.S.-Japan Understanding Shows No Despair; China and Britain Deeply Concerned and Maintain Contact with the U.S.; Tokyo Remarks Have Aroused Reactions from All Sides <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura conferred again with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. Afterwards, Ambassador Nomura told people that he felt there was "still hope" for a satisfactory result. When Ambassador Nomura stepped into the State Department at the beginning of the meeting, he said to the crowded group of reporters, "Why are the newspapers so pessimistic? We are very optimistic. You Americans are usually straightforward and fearless people, so why can't you get the idea of war out of your heads?" General Nomura and Kurusu held talks with Mr. Hull for two hours and forty-five minutes. Hull told the press that if the Japanese diplomatic representatives informed him that they were prepared to continue negotiations, then he would continue the talks next week. He also said that he believed the matters discussed would be relayed to Tokyo by the Japanese representatives. Before the negotiations continue, the Japanese special envoys particularly hope to receive a response from the Japanese government. When the two Japanese ambassadors walked out of the State Department, they were both in good spirits. Hull said that all that can be said at present is that what is being discussed is ordinary consideration and not special details. He also said that the talks are of an exploratory nature and have not entered the stage of formal diplomatic negotiations. He declined to say whether the two sides had put forward a general solution to all problems in the Far East, and also declined to say whether the talks had made satisfactory progress. When asked whether any points had been agreed upon with each other, Hull said that he could not answer this question, lest it give rise to misleading information. When asked whether the two Japanese envoys seemed eager to avoid a U.S.-Japan war, Hull said that the best way to ask this question would be to ask the two special envoys directly. Mr. Kurusu told reporters that he would prefer Mr. Hull to issue a formal communique, so that there would not be two different statements issued at the same time. Someone told Mr. Nomura that the length of their talks was enough to break the State Department's record. Mr. Nomura said, "This is probably because I am not proficient in English." Observers believe that when Mr. Hull explained the U.S. policy, he clearly indicated to the Japanese envoys that if Japan could change its foreign policy as the U.S. said, then Japan would benefit from it.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt said yesterday that he believed he would meet with Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura soon, but he had not made any definite arrangements with them. When asked about other issues related to Japan, the President told reporters that he had no news to announce. Kurusu and Nomura met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday. It is reported that they had consulted with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull for a long time on Monday. Both of them were in good spirits when they walked out of the State Department yesterday.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – Authoritative sources here revealed today that the British are fully aware of the situation of the U.S.-Japan talks. Secretary of State Hull attended the meeting for nearly three hours yesterday. Afterwards, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Halifax visited Hull, which shows Britain's concern for the talks. Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih also met with Hull yesterday, which shows that the Chinese side is probably fully aware of the general issues related to the U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 19th – Authoritative sources here announced today that the Chinese side here believes that Prime Minister Tojo's three principles are an open challenge to the United States. In addition, Shimada and other Japanese Diet members have fiercely attacked the United States, so it is believed that Kurusu's mission will definitely fail. Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and other Chinese government leaders have said that they believe that after the recent attacks on the United States by Shimada in Tokyo, it will be difficult for the U.S. and Japan to reach an agreement, because the attacks from Tokyo have ruined Japan's hope of persuading the United States. The Chinese here are unmoved by the speeches in the Japanese Diet. Well-informed sources explained, "Japan now seems to be explaining to the U.S. government and people that Japan and the United States cannot reconcile on the Pacific issue. We are confident that the Japanese will effectively prove this point." Well-informed sources pointed out that although the Japanese do not yet show signs of attacking Kwangsi in the near future, China and the U.S. have been closely preparing to welcome the Japanese invasion. A large number of Chinese troops are now on high alert, and the U.S. volunteer air force has also made technical preparations so that it can fight immediately.</p>
<p>The so-called Three Diplomatic Principles of Japan are Unanimously Denounced by American Newspapers as Arrogant</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 19th – New York and Washington newspapers yesterday expressed extreme doubt about the success of Kurusu's trip. Commentators from various newspapers unanimously condemned Prime Minister Hideki Tojo's three principles for Pacific peace announced in the Diet. The "New York Times" stated, "These conditions of Japan are absurd. The Japanese Prime Minister cannot hope that the United States will change its traditional policies due to Japan's demands." The title of the "New York Herald Tribune" editorial was "Togo and Japanese Peace." It stated that understanding Japan's "true intentions" is the only definite answer, and that views on peace differ. A certain kind of peace is more hateful to us than war. This is the reality in Asia. The more Japan believes in the justice of its mission, the more irreconcilable its ideas of a new order are with the American ideas of an orderly world. The "Washington Post" stated in an editorial commenting on the speeches of Tojo and Togo, "There is no sign that Japan is prepared to make any concessions to the demands of the United States. On the contrary, Japan insists on making demands on the United States that are tantamount to an ultimatum. If Japan is willing to show its colors, it can get them."</p>
<p>Reuters Special Correspondent, Washington, 19th – Shimada's hostile remarks in the Diet yesterday, which simply advocated that Japan immediately declare war on the United States, have caused a reaction here that can be described as surprising. Shimada made strange arguments when he supported a resolution that identified the United States as the root cause of the current European war. On Monday, Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo also made equally fierce remarks, so the general impression here is that the Japanese government is eager to destroy its mission to the United States, and Kurusu can be said to be a special envoy carrying outward peace but inward bricks. However, observers who are familiar with the Japanese and their actions feel that their remarks are just a large-scale bluff aimed at seizing the best negotiation results. The general attitude here can be seen in the words of Scripps Howard newspaper commentator Clapper, who said that Tokyo's remarks directly demand that the United States completely abandon its policies and listen to Japan's arbitrary actions. If Kurusu can turn this kind of demand into a peaceful solution, then Kurusu is not only a politician but also a magician. If Tojo's remarks can represent Japan's final negotiating position, then there is no possibility of compromise between the U.S. and Japanese governments except for mutual discord. The "Baltimore Sun" stated that Kurusu's government had given him a questionable background when his elbow theory began, and Tojo's third expectation, that is, that third countries should try to prevent the European war from affecting the Pacific, is even more ridiculous. In fact, the responsibility for turning this expectation into reality lies with Japan, because Japan is one of the Axis powers and a country that has been at war in Asia for many years. In terms of Tojo's second point, trade with Japan will naturally return to normal when Japan mends its ways. As for Tojo's first point, the United States insists on its principle of not recognizing changes in the status quo caused by force. If Kurusu is bound by Tojo's expectations, then his discussion will definitely have no results.</p>
<p>London Pays Close Attention to the Progress of Negotiations, Believing that the Safety of the Pacific is at Stake</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – The safety of the Pacific situation is currently uncertain, so the British government is now paying close attention to the U.S.-Japan talks being held in Washington with deep interest, and close contact is still maintained between Britain and the United States. The general reaction here to the remarks of the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister is extremely unfavorable. The Japanese Diet has also passed a fierce anti-American resolution, which makes the prospects for the Washington talks and Pacific peace not optimistic. British newspapers such as "The Times" and "Manchester Guardian" have all tried their best to refute Tojo and Togo's remarks on the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, pointing out that they hinder the possibility of a solution. The "Yorkshire Post" commented on Tojo's three points, and its remarks can represent the general trend of public opinion, saying that if these conditions are accepted, then the British and American governments will directly abandon the basic points of their policies. The "News Chronicle" pointed out that Tojo's first condition is an arrogant demand. Most British newspapers said that if Tojo's three points are the basic principles on which the Washington talks are conducted, then the failure of Kurusu's mission will be undoubted. The U.S. government will have sufficient reason to leave Kurusu to take a boat back to Japan immediately and declare to the Japanese government that the United States does not want to negotiate under threat. The "Daily Telegraph" mentioned Thailand and said that the Japanese army, electricity, and air force are concentrated in northern Vietnam, and there is now a rumor that they are advancing on two routes to the Thai border. The "Daily Mail" said that if the Soviet Union's position does not deteriorate, then Japan may not challenge it. The talks in Washington are just a strategy for Japan to delay time to see what happens. The "Manchester Guardian" warned the Pacific powers not to repeat the mistakes of the former Russian Empire, which did not prepare and was suddenly attacked by Japan. Although the Pacific situation can be pessimistic, the British government's policy has not changed slightly, that is, on the one hand, it hopes for a peaceful solution, and on the other hand, it prepares to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>China, Which Has Sacrificed for Anti-Aggression, Believes that the United States Will Definitely Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 19th – Although Chinese newspapers all believe that the United States will definitely uphold international justice and Chinese sovereignty, some newspapers are quite surprised that the United States is still negotiating with Kurusu after Prime Minister Tojo has made unreasonable demands in the Diet. The Da Gong Bao editorial said, "Kurusu has firmly advocated strengthening Japan's relationship with the Axis powers, and Kurusu is also the representative of Japan who signed the Tripartite Pact. Yet President Roosevelt still received him at the White House. It is truly a strange thing. It is truly unbelievable that the person who created the Tripartite Alliance and the person who created the Atlantic Charter are shaking hands and sitting down to talk with each other. We firmly believe in the perfection of President Roosevelt's personality and the determination of American policy, but we have to admit that the special drama performed in the White House is enough to cause strange reactions among the anti-aggression nations, and may even cause some doubts."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – Senator Pepper, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told reporters that if a war in the Pacific is the price of resisting Japanese harassment, then war will definitely occur. If Japan wants peace, it should immediately stop aggression and withdraw from China. The United States will never tacitly approve of any so-called order built on the bones of the innocent and washed with blood. We have already witnessed their killings and trampling in most parts of the earth. The "Daily News," New York's only newspaper to criticize U.S.-Japan relations, hopes that war can be avoided. All radio commentators believe that the recently proposed Japanese peace is incredible.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Say Whether the Future of Negotiations Will Succeed or Fail; The Japanese Side Claims to Have Completed Preparations</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo remained extremely silent yesterday when asked if Saburo Kurusu had conveyed Prime Minister Hideki Tojo's three principles to Washington. In the Lower House Budget Committee, Nakajima asked what relationship Prime Minister Tojo's three principles had with Kurusu's mission. Togo said that Kurusu was dispatched to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura in continuing negotiations. He said that the government had not given Kurusu any special new instructions, because negotiations had been going on in Washington for a long time. Togo also said that Mr. Kurusu must have learned of these three principles, but he refused Nakajima's request and refused to explain them. When answering questions about the future of the Washington negotiations and their relationship with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, he said, "The future of the negotiations cannot be predicted. As for its relationship with the Tripartite Pact, it should be clarified according to the development of the situation. I am unwilling to answer this kind of hypothetical question." Nakajima raised the question of whether national defense had been prepared as well as the Japanese people to cope with the worst-case scenario. Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, replied, "The army is fully prepared to cope with any changes in the situation." Naval Minister Shigetaro Shimada also said, "The navy has completed all necessary preparations."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 19th – Major Tominaga of the Army Intelligence Bureau rebuked the United States on the radio last night for launching the ABCD encirclement against Japan. The nationalist "Kokumin Shimbun" published Major Tominaga's speech in a big way, saying that British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, India, Burma, and China are actually puppets of the United States. The "Kokumin Shimbun" published his speech saying, "Japan will henceforth limit its attitude towards the hostile actions of the ABCD countries, so I urge the people to prepare to deal with this situation."</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 19th – After the King of Thailand issued an order to establish the Supreme Command of the Thai Armed Forces, another order was issued last night appointing General Sangkram as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Senkram Cher as Minister of the Navy, and Taeval Tait as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. The Supreme Command has the power to control all troops. The first announcement of the Supreme Command contains the appointment of the Chief of Staff of the Former Enemy and the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of National Defense. Various leaders related to defense yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – According to news here today, the recent arrival of four Japanese cruisers in Saigon may indicate that Japan is now increasing its pressure on Thailand. There seems to be no special reason for this action other than a show of force.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Britain Refreshes Army Lineup; Important Transfers of Generals; Brooke Promoted to Chief of Staff; Dill Appointed Governor of Bombay; Paget Appointed Commander of Home Forces <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – According to an announcement last night, there have been many transfers of British generals. General Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, will retire from his position as Chief of Staff on Christmas Day when he turns sixty. His successor is General Brooke (58 years old), the current Commander of the Home Forces. The King has conferred the rank of General on Dill and has approved Dill as the Governor of Bombay in India, succeeding Lumley after his term expires. Lieutenant General Bonnell, Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, has been decided to be transferred to another position, and his vacancy will be filled by Major General Nye. Lieutenant General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Command, will succeed Brooke as Commander of the Home Forces, and his vacancy will be filled by Lieutenant General Montgomery. It is reported that after Brooke takes office as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, he will be responsible to the Secretary of State for War for future British military operations. Brooke succeeded General Ironside as Commander of the Home Forces in July 1940 to arrange British defenses to prevent enemy forces from invading. During the French campaign, Brooke also led the British Second Army Corps in combat against the mechanized German army. General Dill was promoted from Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Chief of Staff in May 1940. Afterwards, Dill also led the British Expeditionary Force's First Army Corps in battle in France and is known for his expertise in strategy. Lumley, the current Governor of Bombay, took office in April 1937 and has a term of five years. The new Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Major General Nye, is 46 years old and is one of Britain's young generals. His predecessor, Lieutenant General Bonnell, is also one of Britain's young generals, 53 years old. In 1939, he served as Chief of Staff of the Far East Expeditionary Force, and the following year he served as Inspector General of the Home Forces. In May, he was transferred to Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The new Commander of the Home Forces, Lieutenant General Paget, is 53 years old and has led troops in battle in Norway. General Montgomery is 54 years old and has led the British 3rd Division in battle in France. In April, he was appointed Commander of the Southeastern Command of England.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – British newspapers mostly express their approval of the changes in key figures in the British military, believing that because the scope of the war is large and there are many changes, military managers feel that the work is very繁重, so their term of office should be limited to balance work and rest. Reuters military correspondent Moore said that this change is a harbinger of Britain's engagement in land warfare in a more active form.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – According to Japanese news from Hokkaido, floating mines were found off the coast of Hokkaido. It is said that they were made by the Soviet Union, so night ferries to the area have been temporarily suspended, and day ferries have been opened twice.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th – Japanese Foreign Minister Togo disclosed yesterday afternoon when answering questions from the House of Representatives Budget Committee that the Japanese government's reply to the Soviet Union's letter rejecting the Japanese protest against the sinking of the "Kibi Maru" by a floating mine has been rejected.

<p>United Press, Batavia, 19th – Japanese Consul General Ishizawa here warned Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies yesterday to use a certain Japanese ship sailing on November 28 to return to their country. Japanese barbershops and other small businesses in Batavia have been quickly closed. Reliable sources said that only a small number of Japanese will now remain in the Dutch East Indies, because smaller businesses cannot operate after the implementation of freezing restrictions here. Ishii's wife and children returned to their country by ship on November 9.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – According to responsible sources, President Roosevelt may not take action temporarily on the strike occupying the mines, pending the conclusion of the Industrial Organization Conference being held in Detroit. It is reported that 50,000 troops have been ordered to prepare to take over the mines in case the stalemate cannot be broken. The troops are well prepared, and the takeover can be completed within a few hours. The House Labor Committee began considering the strike bill today. The chairman of the committee, Democrat Mrs. Norton, predicted that the case would be referred to the council next week. According to the leading military officers responsible for preparing to take over the mines, if the troops are ordered to enter the mines, 75 percent of the strikers will automatically return to work out of patriotic sentiment, and the remaining 25 percent will gradually resume work within a few weeks. According to a military officer, the plan to occupy the mines was completed yesterday. The troops will only carry ordinary weapons and no tanks or artillery, because the troops will treat the miners as friends and guarantee that they will peacefully continue their work.

<p>Chongqing The National Political Council held its fourth and fifth plenary sessions on the 19th, both in the morning and afternoon, to hear government reports. The morning session covered internal affairs and food, while the afternoon session covered education, agriculture, and forestry. As of the 19th, all ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan had completed their reports, except for the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans, which had submitted written reports. The details of the fourth and fifth plenary sessions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The fourth plenary session began at 8:00 AM, attended by members of the presidium Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Wu Yifang, and councilors Tan Zan, Xiao Yishan, Yu Yuzhi, Peng Jieshi, Shi Lei, Kang Shaozhou, Lu Zongqi, and 167 others. Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu, and heads of ministries and commissions, including Dai Fuxian, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, He Yingqin, Zhou Zhongyue, Xu Kan, Gu Zhenggang, Jiang Tingfu, and more than forty others were also present. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the session. First, Minister Zhou Chuiyue of the Ministry of Interior reported on internal affairs work. Regarding the supervision and implementation of the new county system and local autonomy, after the promulgation of the outline for county-level organizations, in order to assess the implementation performance of each province, the "Outline for the Implementation of County-Level Organizations in Each Province and Supervision and Assessment Plan" was formulated, and personnel were dispatched for on-site inspections. Significant progress has been made in areas such as adjusting institutions, organizing Baojia (mutual responsibility system), conducting household surveys, promoting schools, consolidating finances, and organizing cooperatives. An outline for training cadres at all levels has been drafted to train cadres in stages to meet urgent needs. Regarding the clarification of household registration laws and regulations, efforts are being made to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of household registration to ensure simplicity and ease of implementation. Concurrently, household administration cadres are being trained, with the goal of completing preliminary household surveys by the end of next year. Regarding the consolidation and enhancement of police administration, financial assistance is being provided to police education in various provinces and cities. Police personnel are being actively trained to strengthen police capabilities and improve police treatment, thereby enhancing their service effectiveness. Regarding the preparation for land price declaration, various regulations have been drafted and a land price declaration office has been established to formulate plans for phased implementation. Regarding the consolidation of grain storage in various provinces and cities, measures for cleaning up stored grain and grain funds have been drafted and are being actively implemented. Regarding the inspection teams for banning opium and drugs, they have been dispatched to various provinces to conduct thorough investigations and strict supervision. In addition, measures have been taken to investigate and prohibit opium and drugs in war zones and recovered areas to ensure complete eradication. After the report, many councilors raised inquiries, which the Minister of Interior addressed. Subsequently, Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food reported on the recent work of the ministry. Minister Xu first stated that the Ministry of Food was established this year during a very serious grain shortage. Fortunately, the drought did not materialize, and the harvest was abundant. With the establishment of supply offices in the capital and other locations, switching from specialized merchants to certified merchants, and with the assistance of gentry and civilians in various regions, the crisis has been successfully overcome. The supply offices in the capital and Sichuan Province are gradually expanding, rice prices have begun to fall, and grain reserves are now abundant. Particular attention is being paid to the planning of military grain. After the conversion of land tax to in-kind collection, it has been uniformly implemented in all provinces since the second half of this year. At the same time, a fixed-price purchase method is also being adopted to complement the in-kind land tax collection. As a result, not only has the military grain problem been completely resolved, but there is also surplus grain for public grain supply, market regulation, and price control. The central government has also allocated grain to provinces with shortages for circulation, so that surpluses and deficits are balanced, and panic is avoided. Other difficult issues, such as the special sale of grain, the management of storage and transportation, and the collection, allocation, and supply of military and civilian food, are unavoidable, but with active planning and gradual improvement, they will also gradually yield results. After Minister Xu reported on the work of the ministry, he also reported in detail on the future policy direction. Following the report, more than twenty inquiries were raised by the councilors, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of implementing grain policies in various regions and the improvements that should be made in the future, demonstrating the importance attached to the current grain problem. Subsequently, the presidium, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 11 and 13 of the Rules of Procedure, proposed candidates for the members and conveners of the various review committees, which were approved by the general assembly. The list of members and conveners of the various review committees is recorded below: (Review Committees) (1) Military and National Defense Group: Chou Ao, Li Xiangen, Geng Yi, Chen Weizhen, Guo Zhongwei, Wu Xijiu, Ju Lijing, Wang Hansheng, Song Yuanyuan, Tan Wenbin, Yang Ziyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhou Daogang, Wang Huayi, Li Yongxin, Li Qia, Zhang Xiruo, Su Ludai, Shen Junru, Hu Ziang, Lu Qian, Leng Yu, Hu Ruohua, Hu Zhongshi.

<p>Chongqing Overseas Chinese leader Tan Zan from Chicago arrived in Chongqing yesterday and paid his respects to Chairman Lin. He is expected to attend the National Political Council today. Tan brought three proposals: (1) The government should send commercial commissioners to the United States to investigate the preferences of American consumers so that Chinese goods can cater to their tastes. (2) Many overseas Chinese children do not recognize Chinese characters or cannot speak Chinese; the government should send teachers to the United States to educate them. (3) Some provisions in the U.S. immigration law cause inconvenience to overseas Chinese; it is hoped that negotiations can be conducted to improve them. According to Tan, when he passed through Hong Kong, he mentioned that the overseas Chinese in Chicago had donated US$1.4 million for the anti-Japanese war effort. This means that the average donation per person among the more than 2,000 overseas Chinese in the city is US$700. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Rangoon A document signed by citizens of 117 cities in Burma has been delivered to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as a memento of Burma’s celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The document states that the people of Burma will do everything in their power to promote the prosperity and happiness of China and Burma and to create a moral and spiritual foundation for permanent peace and cooperation in Asia. We recognize that the war encountered by China and other countries in the world is caused by the thoughts of human terror, poverty, selfishness, and aggression, and all well-meaning people should fight against it together. Therefore, we pray for the glorious day when victory arrives. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Washington According to well-informed foreign news reports, the Yunnan-Burma Road, although a route for assisting China, is now rapidly transforming into a major route for American military strategy. American experts are now preparing to make the road capable of supplying American troops entering China, and construction and repair facilities are being built along the road to ensure that transportation can resume within an hour of any bombing. In addition, a railway running parallel to the road is currently being laid under American supervision. Washington now feels that if war breaks out with Japan, sending American troops to China will not face the same opposition as the American Expeditionary Force sent to Europe. Quoting senior officials, the newspaper said that sending the American Expeditionary Force to Europe might face strong opposition, but as far as Japan is concerned, we should restrain the people from doing so. The newspaper also said that China is currently lacking pilots for bomber, but the United States has sent 300 experienced pilots to train Chinese aviators to form the core of China's powerful air combat force. The US-Japan talks have not stopped, and these preparations mean that at least 80 American ships will sail to China with supplies between now and May 1 next year. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Chongqing</p>
<p>The Post Office's refusal to hire married women was protested by women's organizations in advance, and now councilors have also raised inquiries. According to the Post Office's explanation, the reason why women were not allowed to apply for this year's recruitment is that postal workers are mostly assigned to serve in occupied areas, and the current volume of mail is very high, making the work very heavy, which is not suitable for women. Therefore, restrictions have been placed on married women, which will be lifted after the victory of the anti-Japanese war. In addition, due to transportation problems, the transfer of mail is often difficult, so the Post Office hopes that all sectors will refrain from sending Christmas and New Year's greeting cards this year, which is also a way to save money.

<h3 id="e29">Analysis of US-Japan Negotiations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After the arrival of Japan's special envoy Kurusu in the United States, he has met with US authorities twice. Both sides have maintained a mysterious silence regarding the progress of the talks. Formal negotiations have not yet begun, and it is difficult to predict their success or failure. However, considering the reactions from various parties in recent days, a pessimistic attitude seems to prevail, which warrants careful examination.</p>
<p>The dispute between the US and Japan in the Pacific is not a new issue, dating back more than twenty years. The relative peace maintained in the decade or so following the last European war was primarily due to both sides agreeing to the principles of safeguarding China's independence and territorial integrity in the Washington Conference. Since the September 18th Incident, when Japan occupied Northeast China, the fundamental principles of the Nine-Power Treaty were first undermined, indirectly causing a new conflict between the US and Japan. Over the past ten years, relations between the two countries have fluctuated, but Japan's creation of a situation in the Far East by force is undoubtedly the main obstacle between the US and Japan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, US-Japan relations became even more strained. Although the US authorities, constrained by isolationist factions, could not take measures to uphold the dignity of treaties and deter acts of aggression based on their consistent beliefs, their consistent "non-recognition policy" was sufficient to indicate the US's dissent and reservations regarding the Far East situation. When Japan put forward the slogan of a "New Order in East Asia," continued its southern advance, and formed a military alliance with the Axis powers, taking advantage of the European war to expand and coerce Britain and the United States, US-Japan relations rapidly deteriorated, reaching a critical point with the US's freezing of Japanese assets and imposition of an embargo this summer. During this period, Japan has repeatedly made it a priority to ease relations with the United States. The Abe Cabinet and the second and third Konoe Cabinets actively sought compromise, but ultimately, no progress was made due to the fundamental differences in views between the two sides. Now that Kurusu has been sent to the United States, the world sees it as the final negotiation. Both the US and Japan are making preparations for any eventuality. This tense situation, watched by all, is unprecedented in the history of the Pacific. At this point, the US's consistent firm stance has been repeatedly stated by the Washington authorities as unchangeable. On the Japanese side, there is no sign of changing course. The issue of China is particularly critical, and the views of both sides are now clearly diametrically opposed except for the common goal of maintaining peace in the Pacific. From this, it can be seen that the pessimism expressed by the world is by no means a subjective prejudice.</p>
<p>So, is Kurusu's trip really as some observers believe, meaningless except for delaying time? Perhaps the facts may be so, but the Japanese authorities, despite appearing increasingly aggressive, are not without expectations for Kurusu's trip. Coinciding with Kurusu's meeting with Hull in Washington, the reports of the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on administrative policies and foreign policy in the Japanese provisional Diet aroused unanimous antipathy from Britain and the United States. In particular, the explanation of the resolution on completing national policy proposed by Shimada Toshio on the 18th on behalf of various factions of the House of Representatives, as well as the resolution on that proposal, blamed Britain and the United States and placed all responsibility on the US authorities, hoping that the Japanese government would pursue everything with the aim of achieving the objectives of the war, casting a shadow over the ongoing Hull-Nomura-Kurusu talks. These were certainly a form of threat, but also a kind of external maneuver. What really deserves attention are the three principles put forward by Tojo. Among these three principles, the first, "Third countries must not hinder Japan's policy of resolving the China Incident," and the second, "All countries must not make military threats against Japan and must lift the economic blockade and restore normal economic relations," are Japan's main demands, while the third, "Preventing the expansion of the European war to the Far East," is merely a supporting point. Whether the conditions presented by Kurusu to the United States are the same is unknown, but it is believable that these three items must be the main basis for Japan's negotiations with the United States and other democratic countries. Anyone can see that such demands are contrary to the US's position of not recognizing the use of force to change the status quo and "opposing aggression and threats outside the country by force," and as with the first point, it is by no means a matter that the US authorities can consider in negotiations with Japan. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, this is not without offering considerable concessions. First, the issue of the obligations of the Tripartite Pact was not included in Japan's three items. Tojo also hardly mentioned this in his speech, implying that Japan could, if necessary, withdraw from the obligations of the alliance. The Axis relationship can be broken, and the third point, "Doing its utmost to prevent the expansion of the European war to the Far East," can also be interpreted as meaning that Japan is not prepared to fight for the Axis in the Far East. Second, regarding the southern advance, Tojo also lightly mentioned it with the phrase "Japan's peaceful progress in the South," without emphasizing demands for the South Seas. This naturally cannot be immediately regarded as the Japanese authorities' preparation to stop the southern advance, but it may not be a condition for exchanging American concessions. Taking a comprehensive view of Tojo's declared policies, it can be said that he is aiming at the US's emphasis on the European situation and concern for the South Seas and using it, while on the other hand, he is demanding that the United States and other democratic countries stop aiding China and lift the emergency preparations in the Far East and the economic blockade against Japan. It is worth recalling that when Tojo took office, he first put forward "winning the war against China." Now, comparing it with the policies he announced in the Diet, it can be roughly seen that Kurusu's negotiations in the United States, while intended to ease US-Japan relations, are still primarily aimed at "resolving the China Incident" at their core.</p>
<p>The deterioration of US-Japan relations to this point is naturally a consequence of the Tripartite Pact and the southern advance policy, while the war between China and Japan and Japan's desire to expand on the Asian continent are the most fundamental causes. Unless the United States fundamentally changes its consistent policy towards the Far East over the past twenty years and its repeatedly declared anti-aggression stance in recent years, it can be asserted that any negotiations with the United States based on Tojo's three principles are bound to fail. Japan's bargaining and further concessions are certainly not impossible, but judging from the various developments within Japan, it is extremely difficult to reach a consensus with the United States. Even if at most a partial compromise is reluctantly reached, it will only delay the crisis in the Pacific without fundamentally easing it.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 19th: German forces have launched a new offensive south of Moscow, aiming to reach the railway line north of Rostov-on-Don to prevent oil and other supplies from southern Russia from reaching Moscow. Since Thursday, they have been attacking east of Orel, about 200 miles from the Soviet capital. According to a Reuters correspondent in Kuibyshev, the Soviet army is putting up extremely strong resistance and inflicting heavy losses on the German forces. However, a Soviet army led by Goniansky has been forced to retreat and abandon several villages. At Tula, 110 miles south of Moscow, German forces have been contained in both frontal attacks and attempts to attack the northwest of the city. The German official news agency announced on Tuesday night that the improving weather has allowed German forces to launch new attacks on Soviet positions in the Donets Basin, and the resistance of Soviet forces has been broken in many places, with German forces advancing rapidly. German sources claim to have occupied the eastern part of the Crimean Peninsula, but this has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. The German news agency claims that Kerch, which has been captured by German forces, has been protected by the latest warships and has extensive fortifications around the city.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th: A war dispatch from the Soviet newspaper Pravda states that the positions of Soviet troops in Tula on the Moscow front have been greatly improved after a counterattack. On Sunday, German forces launched attacks again, using tanks to attack Tula, but they were stopped before reaching the city limits, with several tanks destroyed by Soviet artillery and the rest fleeing. After the failure of the frontal attack, German forces changed their strategy and attacked the northwest of the city in an attempt to reach the highway between Tula and Serpukhov, but they were also unsuccessful. The fighting has continued for several days, and according to the lowest estimates, the German forces in the area have suffered more than 2,500 casualties.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 19th: A war dispatch from Pravda on the southern front states that General Kleist's German forces have been severely damaged and have been unable to advance for several days. However, after reinforcements, they attempted to break through the defenses before Rostov.</p>
<p>On Sunday, enemy infantry, supported by tanks, twice attempted to break through the defenses of the Soviet "K" sector before Rostov. Soviet forces counterattacked with artillery and machine guns, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and driving them back to their original positions. A military commentator for Reuters in London said that the fighting between Rostov and the Donets Basin is as before and is expected to intensify again. German sources claim that the weather has improved, and the frozen ground has allowed German forces to resume their offensive, pushing Soviet troops out of several positions and continuing to occupy several industrial areas. These claims are unusually vague. Moscow sources report that German forces have twice advanced on the Rostov front lines, but have been heavily repelled.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The Soviet Union Uses Armored Aircraft to Counter Tanks with Amazing Results <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 19th: The Soviet Union has recently invented several new weapons, one of which is a low-flying tank-destroying bomber. This bomber is equipped with pure steel armor to avoid enemy anti-aircraft fire and has achieved great success after trial use. In the past three months, the Tolsykov fleet alone has destroyed 608 German tanks, 1,750 trucks, and 272 aircraft, and has eliminated 10,000 enemy soldiers. The enemy is currently very afraid of this special aircraft. At the same time, Soviet infantry has also obtained automatic rifles for shooting tanks. These rifles can penetrate enemy tank turrets at a distance of 400 meters. In addition, Soviet tanks have more strategies such as outnumbered ambushes and fuel weapons. The number of German tanks being destroyed is increasing.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Travel on the Sichuan River (1) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Sheng</p>
<p>The river flows gently, creating ripples even without wind. Are those wrinkles on the water or your money? Today is a clear and peaceful spring day.</p>
<p>Go on! The terrain compels you forward. Don't fear the long journey! Don't fear the bumpy road! The vast, boundless sea is followed by the plains where the rivers run dry. There are your companions, stirring up waves that touch the sky.</p>
<p>I am used to the gentle flow of water. Last year, traveling west, the car sped through the hills of eastern Jiangxi. Streams with slight eddies flashed past my eyes, and I couldn't help but sing like this.</p>
<p>Waiting for a bus in Ningdu, I had time to walk around the suburbs. It was just such a stream that attracted me to lean against a willow tree and stare at it for over an hour. I always had a peculiar feeling in my heart: this is a familiar pattern, why can't I explain it concretely? The inspiration was finally captured: Ah! What a piece of drifting, unsteady, high-quality crinkled silk! The fine ripples shone with a silky sheen; the swirls formed by many curves were like clouds on the crinkled silk. The clever pattern maker has already appreciated this natural beauty before me and applied it to the patterns of silk.</p>
<p>Arriving in Sichuan, the river flows even more rapidly. For more than a year, I have traveled back and forth between eastern and western Sichuan twice. When I couldn't catch the bus or boat, I took wooden boats several times. In the slowness, I intimately appreciated the taste of sailing on the Sichuan River. Of course, the crinkled silk-like river water, drifting sometimes fast and sometimes slow, was the object of my gaze, reverie, and passing time. In each drifting section (the "shoals" in Sichuan, formed by stone blockages or the steepness of the riverbed), it made a "hong" sound, showing tremendous power, which made me tremble with awe and admiration.</p>
<p>The number of days required for ships to travel each section of the Sichuan River is roughly half the time it takes to go upstream. The ticket price is set accordingly. However, this ratio does not apply to wooden boats. Going downstream, you can still predict the arrival date. If you want to ask an upstream boatman when he will arrive at his destination, his answer will definitely be simple and unpleasant: "Don't ask about the road when sailing a boat!" Indeed, there are too many difficulties in sailing upstream on the Sichuan River. Besides the known difficulties, there are also some unpredictable obstacles and dangers. When the water rises, the shoals are rapid, and the boat cannot be pulled up the shoals; when the water falls, the water in the shoals is shallow, and the boat will run aground if one is not careful. Sometimes, when the cable is being pulled tightly to cross a rapid shoal, the cable suddenly breaks, and the danger at this time is unimaginable. Even if you are lucky and the rudder is handled properly, avoiding sinking, the boat will have to go downstream, and it is unknown when it can reconnect to the tow cable and return to its original position. It is not uncommon for an upstream boat to moor next to a small village for several days while waiting for a sunny day. At this time, even the most slow-tempered person will feel the difficulty of the road to Sichuan.</p>
<p>After the Mid-Autumn Festival, I passed through Yibin and took a boat to Leshan. The next day, the boat was ten miles from Jianwei. The engine struggled with a sloping shoal for two hours, unable to move forward. Shortly after the captain announced the failure of the advance, our novel journey began.</p>
<p>Gathering nine passengers, we chartered a small wooden boat. To be fast, it was stipulated that male passengers must often walk ashore. This, for me, was not objectionable except for its novelty. Taking off my heavy jacket, I crossed the pebble beach and walked onto the green grass. The autumn wind gently brushed my thin shirt and trousers, and I felt unusually refreshed. In less than a few hundred steps, a small red stream blocked the way, and there were no tools for crossing the river. After murmuring for a while, one by one, we had to follow the boatman's footsteps and wade across the water. This was the first time I had walked barefoot in Sichuan. When a pair of bare feet were inserted into the blood-red, sparkling fine sand, how soft and comfortable it felt. "Crossing the river! Ha, ha..." The movie "Back to Nature" began to play.</p>

<p>Reuters, Detroit, 19th: The American Industrial Organizations Federation held its annual meeting yesterday and unanimously passed the board of directors' proposal after four hours of discussion, fully supporting President Roosevelt's policy of aiding China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. It stated that this policy is of great importance to the security of the country. Therefore, the American Industrial Organizations Federation supports the President's foreign policy and supports the amendment to the Neutrality Act. Efforts by people like Lindbergh aimed at dividing the American people must be regarded as Hitler's Fifth Column. The American people demand that those who harbor Hitler in the United States, such as the puppet representatives of Vichy France or the Quislings, not be allowed to sow the seeds of division among the people. In a letter to the conference, President Roosevelt said that we must produce guns, tanks, planes, and ships as quickly as possible without delay. The American government and people are determined to obtain this goal.</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Shanghai Municipal Council Met Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Taking Over the American Defense Zone; Commanders of Defense Forces of Various Countries Also Met Yesterday; It Is Reported that the Volunteers Will Expand Their Enrollment; Japan Expressed to the Authorities its Intention to Increase Japanese Police Officers <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council met yesterday afternoon to discuss who would take over the public concession "C" zone after the withdrawal of the American troops. It is reported that Japan intends to abandon its request for Japanese troops to patrol the area in exchange for adding Japanese officers to the Public Concession Police. According to foreign businessmen, if the number of Japanese police officers in the police department increases, the Japanese authorities will allow the Shanghai International Volunteers to patrol the "C" area together with the police. The Japanese authorities have informed the Public Concession authorities of this intention, and it is thought that great progress has been made in the consultations between the two sides. Since the Japanese have this definite plan, they are keeping silent on the issue of taking over the American defense zone. In the Japanese plan, they also agree that the director of the police department should still be a non-Japanese person. At the same time, Phillypu, the general manager and director of the Municipal Council, also said that the council met yesterday afternoon to discuss the "C" zone issue. However, it is unpredictable what kind of resolutions will be made at the meeting or whether further meetings will be held before a definite position can be agreed upon. Representatives of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai did not attend the council meeting.</p>

<p>It is learned that last night, following the Municipal Council meeting, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also convened an emergency meeting to discuss the issue of taking over the defense of the "C" zone after the withdrawal of the American troops. In addition to Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the American Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Howard, commander of the American Fourth Marine Regiment, the commanders of the defense forces of Italy, France, and Japan also attended. The British defense forces had already withdrawn, but the naval authorities stationed in Shanghai still sent a representative to the meeting. The content of the meeting was kept strictly confidential by the five national defense forces. It was also revealed from another source that the defense force meeting to resolve the takeover issue would be announced the day before the American troops withdraw. Therefore, last night's meeting was only preliminary. It is reported that Commander Glassford of the American fleet had previously discussed this issue with Colonel Howard and other senior American officers at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. After the meeting, Glassford visited Takeda, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps. The content of the meeting is unknown. It is also learned that the commander of the Volunteers also participated in the defense force commanders' meeting last night, but this statement has not been officially confirmed.</p>

<p>It is rumored that British officials in the Public Concession, due to the impending withdrawal of the American Fourth Marine Regiment from Shanghai, are planning to recruit 500 members for the Shanghai International Volunteers in order to address the issue of security within the Concession in the future. They are currently in discussions with US officials. However, in fact, it is very difficult to recruit British troops. Therefore, it is rumored that a group of White Russians incorporated into the police force and some British will be reorganized into a team, but it is unknown whether this matter can be realized.</p>

<p>It is heard that the first batch of American troops is scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai on the 25th, and the military camps sent will be handed over to the Shanghai International Volunteers. However, it is under negotiation. The US Naval Hospital has been decided to be handed over to the Municipal Council. It is also the case that the US Navy stationed in Tianjin will take the US presidential transport ship, which is currently being requisitioned, directly from Qinhuangdao to Manila this weekend, without stopping at Shanghai. The American President Company's President Madison is scheduled to arrive in port around Friday of this week and leave the next day. The President Harrison will arrive next Monday and will also set sail the next day. Both rounds will go to Manila, but the company did not explain whether the US Marines stationed in the city will withdraw on the two mail ships. However, door-to-door boat sales are still normal.</p>

<p>The US Fourth Marine Regiment, which has been stationed in Shanghai for 14 years, will march to the ship in formation when it departs. Before the departure, there may be a farewell drill held on the racecourse. If the drill plan is realized, foreigners in the city will flock to watch the drill, which is bound to be a grand occasion. When the American troops march to the ship, it is expected that they will travel east along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road. The exact date is a military secret and has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Cereal, Bean, and Rice Association, to discuss the issue of 650,000 bags of rice stored in the city's rice warehouses being purchased by the Public Works Department (工部局), held a special temporary meeting yesterday at 10:00 AM at its clubhouse at 15 Avenue Edward VII. According to a letter from the Public Works Department, "The Public Works Department is willing to purchase all the rice at a price of 148 yuan per bag (224 pounds), except for rice that is of poor quality or broken." After discussion, it was resolved that if the authorities purchase the rice at 148 yuan per bag (224 pounds), the losses for the members would be significant, making it difficult to sell at this price. To reduce losses, the authorities should be requested to purchase the rice at 158 yuan and 95 cents per bag (224 pounds), as announced by the French Municipal Council.</p>

<p>On the 6th of this month, the U.S. destroyer "Omaha" captured the German "Odenwald" of the Hamburg-America Line, which was disguised as an American merchant ship, while patrolling the equatorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It is reported that the original German crew of the ship, numbering 33, are still residing in the Hongkew district of Shanghai. The "Odenwald" departed from Shanghai on September 1, 1939, and traveled to the United States via Yokohama, two days before Britain declared war on Germany. Before leaving Shanghai, the ship dismissed its 33 German crew members and hired 37 Chinese sailors in their place. The German crew planned to return to their country, but the outbreak of war forced them to stay in Shanghai, residing on the German ship "Ramses," which was stranded in Shanghai due to the war. Three months ago, when the "Ramses" left Shanghai, the crew moved to the Hongkew district. At the same time, the "Odenwald" also took refuge in Yokohama due to the outbreak of war. The Chinese crew were all dismissed and returned to Shanghai on an American President Line ship. Two of them died on the ship during the voyage.</p>

<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that Mr. Liddell, Chairman of the Board, and Dr. Minders, a director, presented a report to the board meeting yesterday afternoon (the 19th) regarding their trip to Hong Kong and negotiations with the Price Stabilization Fund Committee. According to the report:</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange for Foodstuffs Secured for Four Months</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Fund Committee has already provided foreign exchange for four months, starting from November of this year, to purchase 140,000 tons of rice, as well as large quantities of flour and cooking oil, in order to drastically lower prices. In addition, a large amount of foreign exchange has been allocated to purchase coal. The Price Stabilization Fund Committee has expressed sympathetic importance to the significance of supplying Shanghai with essential goods, so the public can rest assured. There is now no reason to lose faith in Shanghai's future as it has been lost in recent months. The Price Stabilization Fund Committee does not intend to supply foreign exchange for luxury goods, but the Board is confident that the Committee will be able to supply the foreign exchange needed for all items essential to the lives of both Chinese and foreign residents in this city.</p>
<p>Avoid Hoarding; Cooperation is Desired</p>
<p>The public should not panic each other and should refrain from hoarding. The Committee will not approve any foreign exchange for the purchase of goods for hoarding or resale at black market prices. At the same time, the Board will do its best to stabilize the market situation, but this will be difficult to achieve without the support of the citizens. The Board unanimously expressed satisfaction with the report of the two gentlemen and expressed their admiration for their work.</p>
<p>Goods Sold Separately Must Have Labels</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has issued a notice stipulating that all goods sold separately by retail stores, which have been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls, must be labeled, stating the price per pound, per dozen, or per item in figures at least one inch and one point in size.</p>
<p>Rules for Registering Purchases and Inventory</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has issued a notice stating that all individuals, partnerships, or companies that sell separately any goods that have been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls must comply with the following rules: The date of purchase and from whom the goods were purchased must be recorded daily. The quantity of each type of goods sold to customers must be recorded daily, or, to the extent possible, diligently record all detailed records, such as sales slips or account books, which must be readily available for inspection. Anyone selling wholesale quantities of goods must record the names and addresses of the buyers for each transaction separately. Inventory on hand must be recorded daily, or, to the extent possible, diligently recorded. The records must correspond to the sales records. This record must include all inventory belonging to the individual, partnership, or company. If any inventory is not stored at the retail location, its storage location must be certified. All records prepared in accordance with this notice may be inspected at any time by officials duly appointed by the Bureau.</p>
<p>Regulations for Licenses of Candy Stores, Etc.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has issued a notice stating that, starting from November 20 of this year, the license regulations for bakeries, confectionery stores, dairy farms, food and beverage stalls, foreign food stores, Chinese food stores outside of restaurants, foreign wine shops outside of restaurants, fruit stalls, beer halls outside of restaurants, private vegetable markets, and stores selling other foods in Category 1 (ice cream), Category 2 (meals), Category 3 (rice), Category 4 (soda, fruit juice, etc.), tobacco stores and stalls, and wine shops outside of restaurants will all add the following clause: "If any licensee refuses to sell any inventory that has been announced by the Bureau as subject to price controls, the Bureau may revoke their license and confiscate the inventory."</p>

We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic donations and support from all sectors of society, which has allowed impoverished students to focus on their studies with peace of mind. The sincerity of people from all walks of life, who have acted righteously to benefit young people, is not only deeply appreciated by the students, but also benefits the educational and cultural fields. The assistance provided is deeply appreciated. The staff of this newspaper are grateful for the guidance of all sectors, and are ashamed to have made no contribution, but have been spared from failure. We will now publish the income and expenditure accounts and a general overview of the first scholarship fund as follows. The details of the continued operation of the second scholarship fund will be published in this newspaper tomorrow.</p>
<p>Income: From July 13th to the end of October of the 30th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1941], a total of 67,007 yuan and 93 cents was received from readers' donations to the scholarship fund.</p>
<p>Expenditures: In this period, 41 university students were paid a total of 4,573 yuan; 225 middle school students were paid a total of 13,395 yuan and 70 cents; 79 elementary school students were paid a total of 2,641 yuan and 50 cents; 521 students in industrial and commercial after-school classes were paid a total of 12,370 yuan and 40 cents. The three disaster-stricken children, Ni Zhaoqi, Bao Jiazeng, and Wu Gensheng, were each subsidized 500 yuan per year until they completed junior high school, as decided at the first meeting of the association, with a total of 4,500 yuan to be allocated. A total of 750 yuan was paid out in this period. The above five items totaled 869 students, with a total payment of 33,730 yuan and 60 cents.</p>
<p>Balance: After paying out the expenses, the total balance is 33,277 yuan and 33 cents.</p>
<p>Extreme Gratitude for the Enthusiasm of All Sectors: During this period, all companies and firms generously donated to the scholarship fund, and were extremely enthusiastic. Calligraphers, painters, writers, movie stars, male and female students from various schools, factory owners, workers, and even children also generously donated. Various schools donated free academic places, and entrusted the association to review and recommend students. This widespread expression of compassion from all sectors is truly commendable. In addition, we are grateful to Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Nie Lingyu, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, and Mr. Zhao Zongyu for kindly serving as members of the Scholarship Fund Committee, providing much guidance and assistance to the staff. We are also grateful to readers from all walks of life for their constant supervision. The staff will respectfully treat this as a guiding principle and always bear it in mind.</p>
<p>Students in School Should Work Harder</p>
<p>As for the students who have received assistance in this period, they are now diligently studying. In addition to the staff having the opportunity to meet them while investigating the family circumstances of each student, we have not been able to express our encouragement in person. However, now that the students have received financial assistance from various sectors of society, they should be deeply moved by the great expectations of people from all walks of life. When the academic achievements of the students in this period are announced, it will be the day when the students respond to the enthusiastic support of all sectors, and it will also be the day when the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Movement returns the gifts of the students' achievements to all sectors of society. Society does not fail the students, and the students should have something to offer to not fail society. As the academic studies of this period are now nearing the halfway point, we would like to add a word, hoping that the students will work hard to meet the expectations of society.</p>
<p>All Scholarship Income is Returned to the Public</p>
<p>Finally, what we wish to report to all sectors of society is that the expenditures under this scholarship fund are purely for the purpose of allocating funds to the students for academic expenses. As for all supplies and materials and transportation expenses for investigating the family circumstances of each student, no expenses were paid, either provided by this newspaper or paid out of the staff's own pockets. This is a small gesture to ensure that all scholarship income is returned to the public, and to avoid wasting the efforts of people from all walks of life. The staff is ashamed of the limitations of their abilities, and can only repay the readers with the sincerity of wishing to serve them. We hope that all sectors will constantly supervise and guide us, so that the scholarship fund movement can develop and grow. This would be our greatest hope.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Impersonating Mailmen to Sell Goods: Post Office Investigating <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Recently, tricksters have been found in this city wearing green uniforms, impersonating post office mailmen, entering and exiting public residences to peddle goods. The postal authorities are now appealing to the public to pay attention. Personnel wearing postal uniforms are strictly prohibited from engaging in other businesses besides performing their own duties. These postal workers not only wear uniforms, but also have badges affixed with their photographs. To safeguard the interests of both the public and the post office, it is hoped that the public will cooperate with the post office. In the future, if you encounter someone wearing a postal uniform coming to public residences to peddle goods, you can first ask to see their badge. If they can show their badge, please notify the post office of their name and number for further action. Otherwise, if they cannot show their badge, please immediately report it to the nearest police station for investigation according to law.</p>

<p>The motor vessel *Basae Maru* (transliteration) of the Japanese shipping company Toyo Transportation Company, with a deadweight of 63 tons, regularly traveled between Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River. On Monday morning, it was returning to Shanghai from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River when it suddenly sank near the mouth of Wusong.</p>
<p>Two Hundred Chinese Buried at Sea</p>
<p>In addition to a large quantity of cotton being lost with the ship, more than 200 Chinese passengers were also buried at sea. A ship from the Japanese East Asia Shipping Company saw the *Basae Maru* gradually sinking from afar and quickly sailed to rescue it, but by the time it arrived, the *Basae Maru* had disappeared without a trace, and there were no traces of oil or other signs to indicate where it had sunk. It is reported that the Japanese naval authorities dispatched a ship to rescue the passengers after receiving the report, but as of yesterday morning, no passengers had been found. It is feared that all the people on board have tragically drowned.</p>
<p>Sudden Sinking, No Time to Escape</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the *Basae Maru* likely sank suddenly, and the crew and passengers had no time to escape and sank with the ship. This is a rare tragedy in the Yangtze River. The cause of the disaster remains a mystery.</p>

<h3 id="e78">This Year's Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Expected to be Held <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended in recent years due to the changing international situation and unstable times. In order to plan ahead, the General Association proposed a discussion at last month's meeting and sent a letter to the Shanghai General Association to seek their opinion so that if the Shanghai team does not come, they can invite a team from Singapore or Manila to Hong Kong. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai West United Association is holding an emergency meeting on this matter. After a long discussion, the following three issues were raised: 1. The travel expenses of the Shanghai team to Hong Kong need to be considered because the value of legal tender is low and the difference with Hong Kong dollars is too large. 2. The shipping schedule for returning to Shanghai must be accurate. 3. If there are no changes in the Far East situation, sending a team to Hong Kong is more likely. According to the reporter's observation, based on the current situation, there may be no changes in the situation in the short term. As for travel expenses and shipping schedules, these are not difficult problems and can be solved through correspondence between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Therefore, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match is certain to be realized during the Lunar New Year next year. If the Shanghai team can come to Hong Kong this time, it will be an all-Western team, probably a team composed of Western police officers, French businessmen, Portuguese, and Lax elites.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Spun Yarn Speculation Active; Double Horse Buying Enthusiasm Most Intense; Futures of Both Rise to Limit <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be tight, and the yarn trend has resurfaced. This is because the U.S.-Japan negotiations have eased, and there may not be a breakdown for the time being. As a result, speculative buyers and [blank] have become more enthusiastic. At the same time, the passing of the ball trade of miscellaneous brand yarns is not as dull as in the past, and the players are more lively. As a result, the chips are tight, and the rising trend is strong. The highest price of 20-count Double Horse factory single was 2,790 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,725 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening momentum of Double Horse in the morning was still [blank]. The opening price was 2,650 yuan, and it soon fell to 2,625 yuan. However, the market was bullish, and it slowly rose to 2,680 yuan. At the same time, the yarn price in the exchange rose, and people's hearts were also tight. However, Double Horse orders lingered within the 2,700 yuan mark for quite a while. Until near the close of the market, the short positions were all covered, and the situation suddenly became tense. There were also rumors of good news, with hopes of export. It suddenly broke through the 2,700 yuan mark to 2,740 yuan. The closing price was 2,730 yuan. The half-day turnover was 4,150 bales.</p>
<p>The market opened bullish in the afternoon because the yarn for this month at the exchange jumped another 150-160 yuan. The market was greatly shaken, and the buying enthusiasm was even stronger. Double Horse went straight up to 2,790 yuan and announced a limit up. The off-market price reached 2,800 yuan. The distant-month yarn at the exchange also reached the limit up.</p>
<p>The futures market situation of Jinbi Horse is that the development abroad is relatively smooth, and the news is gradually easing. The hearts of all parties have turned to stability, and buying enthusiasm has reappeared. At the beginning of the morning, there was no progress in the news, and many parties were temporarily watching. Sellers were hesitant, and the market atmosphere was still calm. The October opening was 2,420 yuan, December 2,555 yuan, and January 2,670 yuan. Afterwards, because the upstream of the gold market and the factory orders took the lead in soaring, the futures market was excited, and the Zhengjin and [blank] gangs absorbed a lot. The demand on the market exceeded the supply, and the market price rose in a straight line. The near-term close rose to 2,580 yuan in the morning, up 160 yuan, December 2,700 yuan, also up 130 yuan, and January 2,780 yuan, up 110 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying enthusiasm continued. With the support of the exchange's firmness, the market price soared, and it rose to the limit again. The recent close was 2,620 yuan, December 2,770 yuan, and January 2,870 yuan, each up 200 yuan. Looking at the trend, if the international situation may ease, the trend may continue to be firm, but the new buyers are mostly cautious. The table is listed below:</p>
<p>November, December, January, Opening, 2415.0, 2555.0, 2670.0, Highest, 2620.0, 2770.0, 2870.0, Lowest, 2410.0, 2555.0, 2640.0, Closing, 2620.0, 2770.0, 2870.0, Comparison, Up 200.0, Up 200.0, Up 200.0</p>
<h3 id="e87">Cotton Follows Yarn in Rising <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is bullish following yesterday's market, but the factory appetite has not developed. However, people's hearts have turned to excitement again. Today, 40 bales of cotton are being shipped to Xiamen. The flower number movement yesterday is listed below: [blank] Languo</p>

<p>100 pieces, 590.0, Also</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell first because of selling by Southern traders and spot merchants, but then rose again due to buying by colleagues and short covering. As a result, the closing price was about 3-4 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first due to selling by professional merchants, then rose back due to buying by the public, but finally, the market fell again due to selling by European exporters and profit-taking by bulls. The closing price yesterday rose slightly, about 3 rupees. It is also predicted that the market opening today will be the same as the closing price, with no rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Despite the Continuous Arrival of Foreign Sugar in Shanghai, Sugar and Grain Are Only Allowed to Rise and Not Fall, Resulting in Manipulated Futures and Sparse Spot <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Sugar transported by the Taikoo Company from Zhangjiakou arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th) in the afternoon. A large amount of 16,000 bags of sugar shipped from Hong Kong was unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The Jinan Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also transporting 1,170 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and was also docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. (Year)</p>
<p>The sugar market is rough because the 20th is near the delivery date. The transactions made on the 13th and 14th of this month were canceled by the Joint Venture Company as being inconsistent with the regulations. The market opened as usual today, and the delivery was handled according to the usual practice. The 20th period opened at 254 yuan in the morning and closed at 46 yuan and a half, with a highest price of 60 yuan and a lowest price of 46 yuan and a half. The off-market price was 39 yuan. The market opened at 55 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 35 yuan, with a highest price of 55 yuan and a lowest price of 31 yuan. The 30th period opened at 258 yuan in the morning and closed at 61 yuan, with a highest price of 69 yuan and a lowest price of 61 yuan. The off-market price was 59 yuan. The market opened at 65 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 73 yuan and eight corners, with a highest price of 82 yuan and a lowest price of 65 yuan. The situation is still chaotic. Spot goods were completely suspended in the morning and slightly traded in the afternoon. Goods arriving in October were priced at 272 yuan and one corner, which is still traded under the restriction of only allowing rises and not allowing falls, so the transaction is almost zero. The price of Dutch Red was 116 yuan, 90 yuan, and 98 yuan to 205 yuan in the afternoon. The price of Hong Kong Crude was 232 yuan in the afternoon, up 7 yuan. The price of Taikoo Che Bai B ginseng bag Zhuang was 225 yuan, DY ginseng 220 yuan, and HX 200 yuan to 08 yuan in the morning and 220 yuan in the afternoon, up more than 10 yuan. More than 45,000 bags of futures were traded and more than 4,000 bags of spot goods were traded.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market soared, which was due to the fact that although the actual demand was weak, speculative buying was very strong. In the afternoon, the momentum was particularly strong. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose by 4 yuan to 10 yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 yuan. Named brand goods rose more. Customer sales were still bleak. Fellow traders and holders in this street traded more than 500 pieces, and 32 pieces of haberdashery were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Because people's hearts were bullish, the current futures were consistently strong. The Caiqiu standard cloth in the exchange rose by 2.9 yuan to 3.6 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was heard that Double Horse yarn had risen to the limit, and the rising trend was even stronger, rising another 5-6 yuan. As a result, each month rose sharply by 8 yuan to 10 yuan and 1 corner compared to the previous day. The closing price for this month was 94 yuan and 5 corners, December 96 yuan, and January 97 yuan and 9 corners. The spot leader factory single was also strongly risen by 9.5 yuan to a closing price of 104 yuan and 5 corners. The new single of Four Gentlemen Serge was 3 yuan, 7 corners, 8 and a half points, which continued to rise by 3 corners and 1 point.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Bureau Rice Purchased in Large Quantities; No News of Bureau Flour; Stored Flour Still Rampant <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been repeatedly reported. It is learned that the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also transported 10,200 bags of foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, and was docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. It is heard that in addition to purchasing and transporting from Hong Kong, the Shanghai Municipal Council has now directly ordered a large batch of small ground rice from Yangon and has agreed with Jardine Matheson to send ships to Yangon to transport it to Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<p>There was no market for foreign rice yesterday, while more than 100 bags of domestic rice were transferred out through Hongkou. The price of high-grade rice was fixed and the price of second-grade rice was tired. The market was still flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, except for a little embellishment in the actual consumption of foreign flour, the general speculators, holders, and brokers who rushed to the wind were thinking about moving after a long period of quiet. The blindly following people also thought that the low price of flour, more than 20 yuan, was an opportunity to add to their purchases, and the market suddenly showed a prosperous atmosphere. Moreover, since the authorities did not strictly restrict foreign flour, this activity was allowed to move at will. The opening price of Jinlong brand was 40 yuan, then it was increased by 3-5 corners, and then it was raised to 41-42 yuan. The prices of the Fort brand were from 42 yuan to [blank] yuan and 3 corners, which was a sharp increase of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the inventory in the market is extremely thick. Taking the Jinlong and Fort brands ordered by VITA foreign firm as an example, there are still tens of thousands of bags of warehouse receipts that have been repeatedly urged but not shipped. There are even more huge total amounts handled by transfer warehouses and other foreign firms. With this huge amount of inventory in the market, it is inevitable that it will be affected by the equal-price public sale of flour.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Control Has Become the Ending; No Market and Storing Trend is Flourishing Again <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>In the miscellaneous grains market, as control is gradually coming to an end, afternoon trading was restored yesterday. Due to enthusiastic national buying, the market prices of various goods were firm and strong. Under the absorption of the rice industry and speculative oil brokers, edible oil prices rose by about 20 yuan. Corn also saw a rise of 2-3 yuan due to the active kicking of the ball. Red sorghum was strong and expensive by about 2 yuan, and soybeans were tight. The Tongshi sold 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 pieces of Jiangbei raw oil, 50 barrels of Daxu soybean oil, and more than 1,000 dan of Dayou Qing oil. There were also 600 dan of rapeseed oil, 300 barrels of rapeseed oil from Nichihua, Yoshida, Taishan, Kawaminami, and Dachangxin factories, more than 500 bags of Tianjin Jinwu, 200 bags of Xinqing beans, more than 10 carts of Mingguang red sorghum, more than 4,000 bags of spot corn, and more than 300 tons of futures.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Sudden Buying is Strong Again; Cash is Heavily Expensive <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market suddenly turned bullish. The price has returned to outside the 19,000 yuan mark, which was pulled up by the banks' pouring in. Although Xianghe offered 510 taels, and Decheng and Tianyuan each offered more than 300 taels, and Chengji and Mingfeng also squeezed out, it could only create a small spin situation. Dafeng actually re-entered 1,620 taels, and Defu entered 500 taels. The follow-up buyers raised the price wildly. The price on that day rose from 18,600 yuan to 19,550 yuan, and finally rose by 880 yuan. The total transaction for the day was more than 12,200 taels. Decorative gold also rose by 60 yuan to 1,980 yuan. The black market price of pattern silver was 23 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Black Exchange Still Has No Market <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, both HSBC and the Central Exchange rates were flat. The small [blank] counter price of Lanfeng was fixed. The British and American exchange black market had no price and no market. A certain Chinese merchant broker was selling two pence and one two five of British exchange and three yuan of U.S. exchange for transfer in the United States, but no one was interested. However, the export foreign firms sold the April telegraphic transfer to HSBC at a price of 5.40625 U.S. dollars, which was not a large amount.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Tongyi Opened and Bought; The Domestic Debt Market Improved Slightly <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was originally in a spin-and-wait situation, where it could rise or fall. Suddenly, the newly listed Tongyi Bank bought a large amount, which aroused the interest of many parties. The C type once again rushed to the 70 yuan mark. The situation of the U.S.-Japan talks, both sides remained conservatively silent, and the news was therefore quite dull. Before any clues were published, public bonds were still inevitable to spin. Yesterday morning, Senji first sold out, and the opening price of C type was 9 yuan and 2 corners. It happened that Tongyi Bank was newly opened, and the buying was very strong. The market price immediately gradually went up and was raised to 9 yuan and 56 corners. At that time, Dingkang also took the opportunity to buy in, and with the joint efforts of both forces, it was raised to outside the 70 yuan mark. At the same time, Runde and Hongda also bought in, and Jiufeng sold more. Shengda and Yichang also supplied. At the closing, Changji had a slight need, and the market price was fixed. In the afternoon, Runde continued to buy in, and Hengkang and Tongkang both had the appetite to enter. Jiufeng and Yichang continued to sell, and Lianhe also sold out. The market price slightly relaxed, and the situation was still slightly out of the spinning state. As a result, the market price uniformly returned up by 3 corners to 6 corners, and the transaction was about 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Vermicelli Sell Well and Become Tighter <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of line vermicelli have been lively, and the market has tightened. In addition, most of the goods in the hands of the industry are concentrated in a few companies, so the prices are easier to tighten. Yesterday, the market price of Longkou vermicelli was 450 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli was 430 yuan, which was 30 yards higher than at the beginning of this month.</p>

<p>— Sun Jieren</p>
<p>The sky has unpredictable storms.</p>
<p>Our manager's fiftieth birthday is not far off, and colleagues are calculating what to give as birthday gifts: some are giving banners, some are giving silver shields, and some are giving gift certificates worth fifty or a hundred yuan... And me? Terrible.</p>
<p>This problem bothered me for the better part of the day, but finally, I remembered Old Li, my only fellow townsman and friend in Shanghai. Moreover, I heard that he's been doing quite well lately. "Regardless of whether it works or not, it won't take much effort, so let's just give it a try!" Thinking this way, I made up my mind.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, taking advantage of some free time, I put on my only flannel suit and went straight to his place.</p>
<p>When I arrived at his house, he happened to be home. Seeing me from afar, he shouted "Old Sun" and came out of the house to greet me.</p>
<p>His house was a very beautiful and impressive front building, facing south, with many windows and modern furnishings. Compared to my dark and smelly attic, it was like heaven and earth. Moreover, I remembered that the last time I came, the furniture didn't seem as new or as good as it was now, and the walls didn't seem to be painted blue like they were now.</p>
<p>"Old Sun, do you think I've tidied up this house nicely?" Old Li asked with a chuckle, seeing me staring blankly at his room, while offering me a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Uh, uh, that, that... Modern, extremely modern!"</p>
<p>"Shoddy cigarettes, Three-Five brand, please make do!" Old Li said, pointing proudly at the cigarette in his hand.</p>
<p>"No, no, Three-Five brand is not bad, right? Heh, heh, you're too polite!" I wanted to say that I usually only smoke the butts of "Ten Scenery Brand" cigarettes, but I finally held back.</p>
<p>Old Li's sharp suit kept flashing, shining brightly. "It must be made of that something... something-ding... something-ding!" I thought to myself, and couldn't help but feel a surge of embarrassment about my only suit, which was, in fact, made twelve years ago.</p>
<p>"I recently heard that you, my old brother, are doing very well. I wonder where you're making a fortune?" I said, wanting to get to the point quickly.</p>
<p>"Making a fortune? It's just doing some miscellaneous affairs in that ×× Bank! But I often hoard some goods and just get by!" Old Li answered nonchalantly, but he emphasized the words "hoard some goods," as if to show his pride.</p>
<p>"Uh, uh, uh, that's very good, that's very good," I echoed, but my stomach was already filled with anger.</p>
<p>"Unless you don't have money, don't say anything about it. Otherwise, it would be unfair not to take the opportunity to make some money!" Old Li said even more happily. I was almost bursting with anger. According to my temperament, I would have run away, but the manager's gift was not a trivial matter, so I could only endure it.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for that time when the Sanbai Bao Shuangma hurt me, hey! Hey! Old Sun, I could have had at least a few more thousand yuan in my hands." He suddenly said with unusual regret. I didn't respond. I felt it was better to be straightforward with him, as the things he was talking about didn't suit me at all.</p>
<p>"I'm visiting your residence today because... hey, hey, it's... for a small matter!" I struggled for a long time before finally speaking, but my cheeks were already flushed red.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Old Li asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Because I want to give the manager a gift, but I don't have enough money on hand, so I want to... want to borrow some from you..." To be honest, although I'm poor, borrowing money from someone was still a first for me in my life.</p>
<p>"So that's the matter. Why didn't you say so earlier? How much do you need?" Old Li asked casually, already taking out his wallet from his pocket.</p>
<p>"About thirty yuan should be enough," I said, finding his generous gesture very endearing. So I quickly put on a smiling face and replied, stretching out my right hand with three fingers extended.</p>
<p>"Thirty yuan? Here you go!" He pulled out three ten-yuan bills and stuffed them into my hand.</p>
<p>"I appreciate your trouble, Brother Li!" I took the money and hid it, and immediately said to him, "I'll definitely pay it back on the first of next month!"</p>
<p>"No, no, no, Old Sun! Is thirty yuan worth making such a fuss? You're looking down on me too much. If you really plan to pay it back, then I won't give it to you!"</p>
<p>"How can that be? That... that... I'd really be too sorry..."</p>
<p>"Don't say so much! Just take it and use it. Oh, I still have to go to the Venus dance hall!" he said nonchalantly, took out a large wad of banknotes from his wallet, counted them, looked at his watch, and put on his coat.</p>
<p>"Okay, then thank you, thank you, I'm also going home!" I knew how to seize the opportunity.</p>
<p>"What's there to thank! Let's go together! Today, I still have to buy five hundred yuan worth of dance tickets to support my Lily!" He gave me another cigarette, and we walked out of his house together.</p>
<p>On the street, we parted ways. He jumped into a rickshaw, said "goodbye," and left. I, with a sense of victory, walked quickly home.</p>
<p>In this way, I wrote off that difficult situation—the manager's birthday. But my heart was still troubled... Old Li, although a good person, is still not saying the right things.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. A month and a half later, I suddenly received a letter. After opening it and reading it once, I couldn't help but be stunned for a long time. The letter was indeed written by Old Li, but the content was as follows:—</p>
<p>Dear Brother Jieren:</p>
<p>It has been a month since we last met, and I have been thinking of you. The last time I met you, I was one person, but now I am another! Alas! It is painful to say. Recently, I have suffered a terrible defeat in speculation, and the price of the goods I hoarded has also plummeted. The severity of this blow has caused me to be heavily in debt in addition to being bankrupt. My life has become difficult these days. I remember that you borrowed 30 yuan from me last time. Could you please return it immediately, and within the possible range, please give me dozens of yuan more to save me from my urgent need? I hope you understand my difficulties and agree to my request, and my gratitude will be immense.</p>
<p>Please accept my</p>
<p>Best regards, Your Brother Li ××</p>
<p>"Alas! Alas! It is true that the sky has unpredictable storms, and people have... people have what? I can't remember, but isn't this right? I said long ago that this "hoarding" ah, "hoarding" will not end well! And my thirty yuan has finally been a joy in vain? Alas! Alas!" I sighed, thinking that I could only get out that "only" suit again, add another cloth robe, and take them together to the pawnshop I was familiar with.</p>

<p>The motorcycle in the picture leaping through the air is not a trick of the camera, but a real shot. The performer of this amazing feat is a member of the British Army Signal Corps. He leaps over two people and two horses in one jump. The rider himself is not in much danger, but if he is not careful and falls suddenly in mid-air, the people and horses lying on the ground will be unlucky.</p>

<p>Fourteen A Hero's Life</p>
<p>"Fourth Brother, I'm sorry, please take care of me!..." "Boss Wang, it's my fault, please don't be angry!..." Every night, Begonia almost always had to apologize to everyone and admit that he was wrong. Sometimes, he had to save his snack money for three or four days to buy some cakes and cigarettes to share with his colleagues, in order to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>However, these people can only do not to push him around, and beyond that, they can't help him!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Sunday came again. On Sundays, theaters usually have both day and night performances. Although the old plays are performed during the day, the martial arts scenes are not as intense as the main plays. However, unfortunately, in this Red Stage, in addition to the main martial arts actor, there are also three or four very famous martial arts actors. Therefore, on the days when old plays are performed, there are at least three or four martial arts scenes. If a major play such as "Taking Gaodeng" or "Evil Tiger Village" is added in the middle, the martial arts actors will be exhausted.</p>
<p>"Boss Zhang, I want to ask you for a favor today!" During the intermission of the daytime performance, Begonia went to Zhang Yincai alone and said carefully, "When I was singing Sijie Village just now, I felt a little dizzy. Can I ask for a day off tonight and go back to rest?"</p>
<p>Zhang Yincai's pair of goldfish eyes first swept across his face. (267)</p>

<h3 id="e101">An Overview of Fog Chongqing <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Yanwen</p>
<p>(Note) "Fog Chongqing," also known as "Whip," is Song Zhidi's latest masterpiece. It has been performed successively in Hong Kong and other places, attracting huge crowds and receiving unanimous praise. In particular, the play's purpose is serious, and the theme is realistic. The Shanghai Drama Art Society, directed by Hong Mo, will stage it after "Peking Man."</p>
<p>The spur of life After the incident, the youth of North China took the road of exile. College student Sha Daqian and his wife Lin Juanyu, classmates Lao Ai and Wan Shixiu were among the exiled. In the winter of the 27th year, they arrived in Chongqing, all empty-handed, and prices rose day by day. Wan Shixiu finally became a "fortune teller" to support himself, while Juanyu, with the help of her childhood classmate Xu Man (now renamed Terry), opened a small restaurant with Zhao Su and his wife. Terry's behavior was a bit improper, and she was in love with a wealthy man named Yuan Murong, who was a director. But in order to survive, she had to ignore so much. But this matter was most opposed to Daqian.</p>
<p>Transition After the small restaurant opened, the business was very prosperous, earning more than 4,700 yuan in five months. But because it was too easy to make money, a dark struggle arose between them between rights and obligations. One day, Zhao Su had a misunderstanding with a customer over a small matter, which caused a great uproar. As a result, everyone was full of complaints. Murong took the opportunity to entice Daqian to stop and advised him to go to Hong Kong to be a "sitting guest," which would be easier to make money. So the small restaurant decided to close. But Juanyu, inspired by her sister Jia Di, felt that she should participate in the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>Return from Hong Kong Daqian returned to Chongqing after making a lot of money in Hong Kong for half a year by selling contraband goods, and he was a completely different person. Juanyu, on the other hand, was also a different person in the upsurge of work. Terry was still the same as before, and she always felt a little vague when she thought about the future. At this time, Jia Di's training period was over and she was going to the front. Terry casually said she would go with her, but Murong forced her to go. However, because Juanyu wanted to send winter clothes and donations to the front, Daqian did not allow this selfish and contradictory situation, which was obviously already present among several people.</p>
<p>Sick Daqian had completely changed and became accustomed to a luxurious life. He also contracted syphilis. Juanyu was also infected. Lao Ai's lung disease was exacerbated by excessive stimulation. After he became seriously ill, he regretfully said: "Everyone chose the easy path during difficult times. This result is inevitable." Murong showed diligence after Juanyu was stimulated. At this time, he entrusted Shixiu to bring her a savings account of 350,000 Hong Kong dollars and a plane ticket to Hong Kong, hoping to go to Hong Kong together. Unable to resist Shixiu's persuasion, Juanyu finally agreed to go to Hong Kong for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Two roads "Why did Juanyu go to Hong Kong?" This was another conspiracy of Murong. As a result, Juanyu returned the savings account to Terry and resolutely left. Murong later wanted to use the same trick again, but at this time Daqian and Terry both repented that they should not have been fooled by Murong, and in view of the fact that Shixiu was expelled from the country for not having a proper job, Lao Ai died of illness in the hospital, and Jia Di angrily went to the front again, they regretted that they had taken the wrong path, as Lao Ai said, and felt that young people like Jia Di had unlimited prospects in extraordinary times.</p>

<p>The Huayi Theater Company will perform Tolstoy's famous work "Banner on the Autumn" for three days starting this Sunday at the Xuan Palace, jointly directed by Yang Xiaozhong and Hu Feng.</p>
<p>Tianfeng is currently rehearsing Fei Mu's "Plum Blossom Dream," performed by the entire cast, as another great contribution after "Qing Palace Grudge." The costumes used in the play are all custom-made by the Gu Embroidery Shop in Suzhou, worth 20,000 yuan. It is said that it will be performed after "Isolated Island Men and Women."</p>
<p>Film actor Jiang Ming has officially left the National Film Company and joined the Green Bao Theater as a director.</p>
<p>The China Travel Service originally planned to perform "Lady City," adapted by Wei Ruhui from "Flying Orioles and Chaotic Flowers," after "Wilderness." However, because Tang Ruoqing refused to perform the play because it did not suit her personality, it was changed to "Fragrant Note Tears," adapted by Tao Qin from a foreign film script. It has been scheduled to be performed on Saturday night this week.</p>
<p>The "Postal Drama Club," organized by postal staff in this city, is currently actively rehearsing Yu Ling's famous work "Women's Apartment," directed by Hu, which will be performed at the Lyceum Theater next week.</p>

<p>Kun Dan Zhao Wanshuang is scheduled to go to the Datong Theater in Xiamen this month to perform, with a monthly salary of 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The team behind Tianchan Li Shaochun is led by Shang Xiaoyun and the entire Rongchun Society training class, including Shang Changlin and Shang Changchun. The authorities of the theater have already admitted to inviting them.</p>
<p>The Xindu Theater of the Xinxin Company will change to perform Peking Opera next year. It is said that Wang Zhuangbai and Mao Jianqiu have been hired to perform on stage, scheduled for March. None of them will visit Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>The Daxin Dajing Troupe automatically increased the salary of all backstage performers by 10% from the day before yesterday, but the main actors still expressed that it was too little.</p>

<p>Chapter 19 The City is Filled with Dusk Hordes</p>
<p>Chen Fei, of course, was also willing to work hard to kill the thieves. The two led more than a hundred iron riders, flew gracefully from the formation to the front of the formation, and charged straight into Li Chuang's formation. Li Chuang did not care that a small number of Ming soldiers were fighting in the front, so he ordered the thief generals Yizhi Tao and Ma Feitian to meet the enemy. Zhang Cangqiu wore a battle helmet, a white robe and white armor, a Lingbao treasured saber on his waist, but he held a three-pointed double-edged knife in his hand, also tied with white tassels. The sword light was like snow, setting off his dark face, which was truly black and white. Chen Fei also carried a pair of mandarin duck copper hammers. He saw a group of soldiers in the opposite bandit formation carrying two thief generals to fight. Zhang Cangqiu urged his mount, shouted loudly, waved the three-pointed double-edged knife in his hand, and charged forward first. The thief general Yizhi Tao waved his spear to meet him. He saw Zhang Cangqiu's knife light hovering over Yizhi Tao's head a few times, and Yizhi Tao's head was already gone. When Ma Feitian raised his knife to save him, Chen Fei rushed forward, blocked the knife with his left hammer, and used a bottom-of-the-leaf peach theft with his right hammer, hitting Ma Feitian's waist, and he fell face up, rolling off the saddle. Ma Feitian had a brother named Feihai, who was also in the formation. Seeing his brother being knocked off his horse, he was shocked, and without waiting for Li Chuang to order, he waved his spear and rode forward to avenge him. Zhang Cangqiu went forward to fight him again. In less than seven or eight rounds, he was cut off his horse with one knife. Zhang Chen and one general killed three thieves in a row on the formation. Li Zicheng was secretly shocked. Liu Zongmin had fully recovered from his injuries and saw it in the formation, and was furious. He said to Li Chuang, "This person is a brave man under Wu Sangui. In the previous battle of He, he suffered a loss from him. Today, he must avenge him and avenge his shame." (223)</p>
