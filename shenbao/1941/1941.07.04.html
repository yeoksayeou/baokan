<h3>中國與德義絕交後國際情勢益明朗　反侵略國家陣綫完成美日間關係更見緊張</h3>
<p>重慶　中國之與德意斷絕外交關係、本日被認係可使國際情況全景更臻明朗化、與蘇德戰爭之爆發無異、中國現時、當然可以公然完全反對軸心國、因而完成反侵略國家之陣綫、中國之政策久已有此種趨向、但由於與軸心國尙維持正常之外交關係、故必須遵守外交上之小節、基於此種情形、故不能將中國國際政策之趨向、完全向中國之大眾宣布、此項複雜之、現時業已消除、預料將來關於中國之國際立塲、將有單純而直截之公布、中國固不能容忍軸心之行動、但重慶方面對於與德國斷絕、尙似不無惋惜、蓋中國尙未忘在戰事初期時、德國曾給中國以實際援助、不因柏林官方對中日戰爭之所持之政策、而有影響、當時中國曾自德國獲得大批軍械軍火、及其他物品、而德國之軍事顧問、尤大有助於中國之初期戰爭、尙有大部份人士、其中有係居於負責地位者、彼等或則曾留學德國、或則以為中國在軍事上及政治上、皆應模仿德國、但此派人士在過去數月中、保持緘默、其中或有已變更其意見者、彼輩全體當然皆極力贊成政府之與軸心國斷絕關係、中國之與意大利斷絕關係、絕少有表示惋惜者、自墨索里尼侵略阿比西尼亞、中國答應援助國聯施行裁制後、中意國交即已虛有其表、意大利方面曾坦然承認意國對中日戰事之政策、自始即係欲提倡遠東和平、使中國屈服於日本據本日所探悉、自中國政府尙在漢口時、德國出而斡旋和平而告失敗之後、意大利之外交方面、亦曾致力提倡和平、雖未成功、然中意之關係並不困而改善、駐華意大使從未至重慶呈遞國書、因此中意關係更為緊張、昨日下午八時、特別招待報界、由外部發言人邵毓麟、宣讀中國政府與軸心國斷絕上交關係之宣言時、空氣非常緊張、邵氏謂外交部典禮局長凌其翰、斯時方以郭泰祺之宣言及護照、交與德大使館秘書諾爾特、及意大使館秘書、德代辦萊森方在成都、但據悉渠將立即返重慶云、德國記者並未參加招待報界會議、據悉海通社昨日起已停止服務、發言人宣稱、業憶通知軸心國之大使館、謂中國政府將給彼等以各種便利、使彼等經由越南而離此中國、重慶市政府及警備司令、已奉令在使館人員等未撤離時、盡力加以保護、而有德意人民僑居之各處城市、當局亦已奉令於彼等留此時、給與保護、發言人又稱、關於在德國及意大利之華僑問題、現時正在考慮、關於在渝之德國新聞機關、外交部亦將對之採取各項必要之步驟、發言人又稱、關於軸心在華利益、及中國在軸心國之利益之保護問題、現時尙未準備發表聲明、外交方面本日極不相信流行於重慶之觀念、謂軸心之此次舉措、係欲誘勸日本政繫蘇聯、此間相信承認之主要目的、係欲使日本之大眾、相信關於解決中國事件已有多少眞正之進展、（三日合眾社電）</p>
<p>日親德派已佔優勢</p>
<p>紐約　紐約民生講壇報頃著文、謂軸心國之承認南京、已使德國對遠東戰爭、更徧向日本方面、並謂吾人可信、東京方面對政策問題所為經十日之久之辯論、其結果已表明親德者佔優勢、恐日本必將宣布一種足以擾亂美國之政策焉、該報又信、希特勒由此種承認南京之方式、業已支付其要求日本幫忙之代價、希特勒此後即可要求日本施行大胆之舉動、以消滅美國參加大西洋戰事之熱度云、（三日合眾社電）</p>
<p>東京　今日消息稱、日本之宣布同時尊重德意日三國盟約、及蘇日中立條約、係東京與柏林成立一種協定之結果、依該協定、日本或將繼續努力以阻止美國參加歐戰、以報答軸心國之承認南京、日本人士相信、德意承認南京、更可支持日本企圖傾覆重慶之政策、然就日本而言、能解決中國事件、因為其主要之問題也、非心人士相信、德意承認已使日本不能再採取獨立之外交政策、因是此項結果、可認為德國外交上又一勝利、東京之軸心國人士、似均認日本是否進攻蘇聯、為無足重輕、若輩顯然相信美國對蘇之援助、經由海參威以達西方、恐將為時太晚、無濟於事、然此輩人士、正在極力設法使日美關係緊張、以使美國不敢參加歐戰、此間軸心人士預料、在日本仍然支持南京之時、美日緊張、必將有增無減、因日本支持南京、仍係一種與美國政策絕不相容之現狀、就現時美國援助重慶之增加、蘇聯援助重慶之減少、且美國已為蔣介石將軍幕後主要勢力等情勢而觀、更可徵知日本行動與美國政策之積不相能、今軸心國之承認南京、乃可使日本更積極傾向於南京支持、而使日美對中國問題之妥協、愈不可能、再軸心之承認南京、並可使日人、將最近軍事上成就之缺少、置之不論、而主張其從事第四年戰爭之理由云、（三日合眾社電）</p>
<p>德義使館人員撤退</p>
<p>柏林　官方中央日報本日宣稱、中國駐德大使館職員、連大使陳介在內、共十三人、曁中國駐意太使館之職員、業已奉令從速回國、該報稱、然後再決定如何返國、彼等大致鈄經由葡京里斯本取道美國返國、中國駐在軸心國之領事館、僅有兩處、一在漢堡、一在米蘭、但領事官員尙未奉令離去、僑德華人約有九百名、其中一百八十名係學生、留意華僑則有約五百人、大部係商人云、（三日合眾社電）</p>

<p>重慶　今晨間各報、一致著論斥責德義、並熱烈擁護政府與德義斷絕邦交之決定、各報並著重聲稱、德義之承認、決不能擾亂國際視聽、中國作戰之決心與信心、將因此而愈為增強、誓必貫澈完全驅逐日軍於境外之決心、中央日報謂德義當局現採之措置、決非其本國人民之意志、而希引導德義兩民族陷於萬丈深淵、實為兩民族惋惜、至於德義與日本若何作進一步勾結、因內容未明暫不批評、惟可預言者、雙方即可勾結、亦未必出自眞意、互相欺騙、互相利用、其結果同歸於盡而已、益世報謂、日本攻蘇之期、已迫在目前、日本多樹一敵、對華自屬有利、國民公報而尙未即刻與之宣稱、實為遺憾、大公報稱、日本於此時要求德義承認南京組織、係近衛松岡固位手段、而其交換則為日本政策之進一步傾向軸心、日本目下雖未必立即攻蘇、至少在姿態上又接近一步、世界大勢、至此已極澄清、中美英蘇四大國家、惟有團結一致、共抗軸心之一條路了、時事新報稱、德攻蘇軍事、未能如預期之順利、因而承認南京組織、以交換日本之協助、日本現除攻蘇以外、別無出路、故對德義要求、自必接受、但其出兵期、必在本月二十日重光返國之後、掃蕩報云、德義之所為、不僅為偶然的失策、實係一種不可饒恕的罪惡云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>為民治而奮鬥　——慶祝美國開國紀念——</h3>
<p>今天是美國開國一百六十五週年紀念，也就是在獨立戰爭宣布獨立宣言的日子。當一百五十年前，正是民權思想蓬勃發皇的時候，「人類生下來就是平等的」這一觀念，由於盧梭孟德思鳩潘恩諸先哲的倡導，已在大西洋兩岸業已深入人心；但其由思想進入行動，使民治主義形成不易的政治鐵則，則實以美國獨立運動一舉開其端。美作家阿波特（L.Abbott）說：「法國革命，英帝國的民治改革，義大利的統一，都不外是美國革命的產物」，這絕非溢美之詞。而今日美國的強盛富庶，且在國際政局中隱然形成中流砥柱，亦當由其獨立運動中追求其傳統的根源。</p>
<p>當時北美殖民地的十三個州，在華盛頓領導之下，為了要求獨立，爆發了熱烈而艱苦的革命運動，其原因盡皆知是徵稅問題所激起；然而十三州民之所以一致表示憤怒者，並非那種捐稅本身之如何苛刻和悖理有以使然，而是因為那一徵稅破壞了一切德謨克拉西的原則。他們覺得沒有他們若干負担加諸其身，是一種不能忍受的壓迫和專擅，為了這，是值得用血肉和生命去奮鬥的。</p>
<p>在今天，這些往事早已成了歷史的陳跡，英美這兩個曾以兵戎相見的盎格魯撒克遜民族的國家，終屬「血濃於水」；且即在血液因素以外的種種實際問題，雙方也有不可分離的利害關係，此一情形，當兩國之一遇到危難之際尤為顯著。不過，在獨立戰爭中所表現愛護眞理正義重於一切的精神，直到今日仍舊是美國人民的重要特點，而且一百五十年來所經歷的種種危難，最顯著的內如南北之戰，外如世界第一次大戰，都是靠着基本精神獲得了光榮的成就。</p>
<p>現在美國正遇到歷史上空前的威脅和挑戰，近十年間美國直接間接所受到的侵略暴行，較之引起獨立戰爭的茶稅一類問題，幾已無法加以比較，因之目前也就是美國立國精神遭遇嚴重試騐的關頭。吾人深信，美國人民之愛護正義眞理與自由，較之過去期間，確屬有加無已，這可見之於其對於侵略獨裁的深憎，對於國際一切義舉的熱舉，尤其是一其數年來如一日的對華同情與支援，都可證明其斷不令在侵略罪惡日益肆其荼毒之際長此超然事外。更就美國當局的抱負來看：羅斯福總統見識之過人與氣魄之雄偉不僅為二十年來美國歷任元首所未見，且較故威爾遜氏之過分躭於理想者更能顯其卓越之才能。從一九三七年八月在芝加哥的演說到最近五月二十七日的爐邊談話，都可證明他主要的一貫理想是如何撲滅侵略暴行的蔓延。最近半年中美國參戰空氣已有意外的成熟，連日前海長諾克斯的演說也都主張應急趁德軍無暇西顧之際出動美國海軍，肅清大西洋之備國危害。不過美國如果進而實行參戰，並非一定值得欣幸，而只是迫於情勢的不獲已。至於少數孤立主義者，迄今仍復抱殘守缺，強聒不休，致使應有的積極措施無形受其牽制，因而讓侵略罪行獲有延長與擴大的機會，那不只為正義與人道所不許，亦且是美國傳統精神的罪人。</p>
<p>自從蘇聯戰事爆發，國際間的分野業已具備了符合世人理想的條件，但是中美英蘇間共同反抗侵略之合作，迄今仍遲遲鮮所表現，在這一點上，美國所擔負的促進任務，也許比較直接參戰更為迫切。於慶祝美國國慶之餘，全世界愛好正義的人都切於此能做更進一步的考慮。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（六）（六）　傘兵的訓練與戰術</h3>
<p>田野之間，溝渠縱横，筆直的公路上，遍布木椿或其他障礙物，造成無數狹弄，守兵星羅棋布，到處皆是，這是今日英國的一幅寫眞。</p>
<p>這種遍體鱗傷的鄉野，是跟着德軍的「垂直包圍」戰略而來的。「垂直包圍」是一種來自天空的新式攻勢戰術。這種戰術並不是轟炸，而是軍隊從空中降落，從軍攻擊敵軍，守軍因須挖掘壕塹，佈置障礙，以阻止飛機着陸。</p>
<p>固然，僅做是傘兵和空中軍隊，或者力量太薄，不足以征服一個有備無患的國家。但若以此作爲侵略部隊的一部份，則侵略便大有成功之望。當蘇聯第一决試騐從飛機降落兵士和配備的時候，我們大半想到在鄉村市集上的跳傘表演。飛機飛得很高，在靑天白日萬目睽睽之下，見那跳傘者縱身躍下，降落傘也沒有張開，正當觀衆斂神屛息，鴉雀無聲的當兄，他便拉開繩索，使降落傘豁然開放，他的身體便也飄然落地，看那傘兵從高空緩緩降下，他是多麼容易擊中一個目標呀！</p>
<p>但在戰爭中，傘兵的降落技術，却大不相同了。</p>
<p>少數瞭望員正在崗位上守望，流動部隊分駐在各衝要地點，聞警即可出動。時値星夜，萬籟無聲。守望者都竭力警戒，不敢閉目，他們初時一無所聞，忽然聽到一聲輕而堅決的命令「投降」！他們出其不意，四面已被侵勢的敵人包圍，便無法抵抗了。</p>
<p>這究竟是什麼一會事呢？</p>
<p>載運這些傘兵的飛機，高翔天空，離目的地很遠，即把馬達停止，在黑暗中滑翔而進，無影無聲。到了選定的地點，由便衣隊發出信號，飛機便突然在離地不足一百碼之處開始降落傘兵。那些兵士逐一自機中躍出，把傘撑開，飄然落地。其餘的降落傘也在同時掉下軍械，子彈和各種配備。</p>
<p>不過幾秒鐘的工夫，乘守兵措手不及，甚或尙未看見的時候，傘兵已到達地面，集合兵器組成一支小小的戰鬥隊伍，具有攻擊實力了。他們武裝齊全，除手槍，步槍，輕機關槍外，還附帶着輕迫擊砲，於是由便衣隊引導，這支小而有力的戰鬥隊伍便開始動作了。</p>
<p>這固是一種「犧牲的使命「，其目的在破壞敵方交通和各種便利。可是這種傘兵實是空中軍隊的光鋒。因爲空中軍隊須由運輸機着陸，與平常的運兵並無二致，故能携帶重兵器，但須有預備飛機降落的飛行塲。這種傘兵，即以佔領，肅淸，和保守飛行塲爲其目的。</p>
<p>這並非純屬理想，而是今日戰爭中眞正發生的一種大概情形。即以荷蘭軍守衛末斯河橋樑的往事爲例，他們奉命防守此橋，必要時當加以炸毀，以阻德軍前進。然在措手不及之際，橋樑已爲傘兵襲佔，德軍裝甲師的先頭部隊，遂得跨進末斯河而長驅直入了。在鹿特丹地方，德方傘兵着陸後，即將守衛薄弱的華爾哈文機塲佔領，空中軍隊遂在塲中降落，同時附近的河道，亦有水上飛機下降。</p>
<p>在德國侵略挪威的時候，傘兵又有好幾决幫着阻滯聯軍的進行，飛機更載運大隊德軍飛渡史卡基拉克海峽。據說德軍在佔領比利時的埃本伊默爾砲台時，曾使用一種秘密武器，此種秘密武器的有吾姑置不論，而德傘兵是佔領該要塞的一個新因素，則可以斷言。在德軍攻擊希臘和南斯拉夫兩役中，傘兵亦佔着重要地位。</p>
<p>可是空中侵略，並非易事。德國在比利時企岡降落空中軍隊時，出於意料之外的發現地上停滿了摩托車。因爲無法登陸，遂吿失效。德軍經此敎訓，纔知道傘兵必須先從空中軍隊降落，去肅淸機塲方可。又據一個傳說，德國傘兵在挪威的那維克，因爲降落時離地太低，跌在崎嶇不平的山石上，以致死傷慘重。</p>
<p>關於英國傘兵在義大利降落所獲的成績，消息頗多矛盾，但顯然是全軍覆沒，非死即傷，或被俘虜。這原是意料中事，且是工作的本質如此，而在負有犧牲使命的傘兵，允須不惜犧牲，以完成破壞某種重耍交通的任務。</p>
<p>傘兵並不是任何人都可以做的。因爲工作過險，故僅許敢死隊員自　擔任，又因傘兵常須在極不利的情形之下在地面上作戰，故祗有曾在他方面受過完全訓練的精兵，始允共自吿奮勇。所以傘兵必須强壯活潑，不能過老，至多以三十多歲爲限。又因爲大多數傘兵攻擊的地點和目標，都是他們所從米見過的，故傘兵須有閱讀軍事地圖毫無錯誤的能力，對於空中照相地圖的每一黑影，皆須能瞭其意義。</p>
<p>那班精選之士，開始作傘兵訓練的時候，一定要深自驚詫，疑心他不在軍隊中而是在馬戲團中了。走繩索和翻筋斗的技術，很是注重，因爲傘兵必須熟習如何着地，方可以不受損傷。他最初係從五六英尺高的平台上作幾决試跳，看起來雖很容易，其實假使他不知道如何着地，一定會受到劇烈震動的。</p>
<p>專門指導員解釋着地時如何全身　弛，而膝微彎，可以免致受傷。迨已熟習此技，即可從較高處躍下。假使設備允許，不妨先在有節制的降落傘座中作下降的練習，新兵能習慣於此種震動。其决纔不用繩自由降落。可是德兵却寗願從飛機上作初步的跳躍。他們和信塔上降落，與實際情形並不十分相合，故無多大價値。練習時可從地面上膺製的或眞正的飛機上，獲得如何走出機門的訓練。</p>
<p>每一個受訓練者又同時由專家指導，硏究降落傘及其摺疊之法。摺疊不合式的降落傘或許不能張開。假使他知道他的降落傘係由專家摺疊，而這專家又是他本人，必能使增加他的自信力。美國傘兵，除了正式的降落傘外，還另帶着一頂救急傘。</p>
<p>傘兵並須學習怎樣在地面上和降落傘檔扎奮鬥。張開到二十八呎寬廣，兜滿着風的降落傘，是不容易控制的。牠會把一個强壯的人拖離地面，好像脫韁之馬一般，把他拉着飛馳，只有懂得如何控制繩索，使牠「漏風」之法，方可避免。</p>
<p>第一次跳躍之日，是傘兵極可紀念的一天。無論他錄用與否，他的內心總有着說不出的感覺，這當然不是神經過敏，而是冀望太切。首次跳躍需要特種的勇氣。就是勇名素著的人物，也會不敢跳下。嘗有飛機損壞，被迫下降，他人紛紛躍出，安全降落，而兵士反有不肯聽從駕駛員命令，寗與飛機同盡的。還有一個故事說，美國傘兵營某，一切訓練皆已完成，迨至首决跳躍的時候，竟然立在飛機門口，呆若木鷄，不敢奮身躍下。</p>
<p>跳傘者知道保護安全的各種設施，皆已實行，駕駛員也已選定地位，把假人投下以測騐風向。他聽得了預備。跳躍的命令，便把張開傘的繩索繫住機上的一條金屬綫，迨至最後命令一發，他已聳身跳向下面了。但這個新手尙不能稱爲傘兵。這不過是第一次的跳躍罷了。他還要練習多次，纔能獲得傘兵的榮譽頭銜。</p>
<p>現代一等强國，都已在創設傘兵隊和空中步兵。美國已編成五百零一傘兵　，足見實騐時期已過，而踏入發展時期了。陸軍部並命令再編成三個傘兵營，並有空中步兵若干隊在訓練之中。</p>
<p>謠傳德國已造成滑翔機二萬八千架，每架可載配備齊全的兵士十四人。一架運輸飛機或轟炸機，可以拖帶兩架滑翔機。所以就理論上說，德國有運輸四十萬空中軍隊及降落傘部隊的能力。　（完）</p>

<h3>日對德蘇政策意見分歧　一派主行動愼重　一派主防備英美</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯三日東京電　今晨此間各報社評日本對於德蘇戰事、所應採取之態度、顯示兩種趨勢、其一反對聯盟政策、堅主日本須自力自決、不受任何國約束、其一主張採取不干涉政策、俾日本以全力注視太平洋局勢、以防英美加緊包圍日本、朝日新聞代表前一種意見、略謂、日本不宜為光榮與利益觀今所動、近衛首相日前曾言、「日本不可乘人之危、輕舉妄動、」斯言具有至理、日本務須推行獨立政策、惟本身力量是賴、報知新聞語氣更甚露骨、略謂、日本對於歐洲各與國、不能再事信賴、日德合作、已成明日黃花、此際日本業已認自身立塲、務當單獨行動、不受援助云、讀賣新聞、則代表後一種見、略謂、日本應將視綫、自北方移至南方、蓋英美兩國將利用目前形勢、增强反日政策、美國現正遣送飛機及駕駛員、前往重慶、禁第三國商船通過巴拿馬運河、在新加坡至密特威島一帶、對日加緊敵意包圍、並在密特威與特里尼達特兩島、增加防禦工事、凡此均可注意、故吾人不應一味注視德蘇戰事而當揭破敵人企圖利用德蘇、戰事、攻擊日本之陰謀云、</p>
<p>合眾社三日華盛頓電　政界方面本日宣稱、日本之聲明、同時尊重三强公約及日蘇中立公約、似足以表露日本國內主張獨立政策而不公然贊助軸心作戰之份子、至少已暫時佔優勢、此即在外表上日本於最近之將來、已決定摒絕直接援助德國、如進攻西伯利亞、或以海軍兩進侵奪英國及荷蘭之利益、反之、日本政策、似欲間接援助軸心、同時並專心致志於建立東亞共榮圈、俾日本能自賴及有獨立之力量、政治專家甚少解釋此舉、為有利與美國者、因無論如何、美國之艦隊將被迫而留駐於太平洋、且日本或將隨時更改其政策、</p>

<h3>假期後　金巿忽起劇烈漲風　高峯達六五七零元</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、照常開始營業、巳打破兩個月來平疲之局、突起劇烈漲勢、價已飛出六千五百元大關外、急遽向高峯挺進、乃在銀行半年結賬假期內、有種種利多傳說、人心激昂、塲內雖有匯票商新豐永全日套出一萬六千兩已翻空、天元加碼售出亦有五六千兩、現滬西幫傾進、義元翻多軋進二萬五六千兩、恒記亦進六七百兩、散戶均多頭、市價有抬無撳、故當日價由六千四百四十五元步升至午後達六千五百七十元、終傳日艦有集中旅順一帶消息傳來、始止漲稍回、終仍軋升一百四十二元、全日交易六七萬兩、現金由一利出成記八十兩、明豐與生元永出新天實及鳳祥和記等共一百廿兩、下午永豐餘出成記一百廿兩、價均照當時期交高二百八十元、計軌升一百元、飾金軋升十元、達七百〇五元、</p>
<p>期貨抬百四十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）在利多傳說下、外匯報緊、人心一致向上、故九點十五分開市在買風中、價已升至六千四百五十元、比假前（三十日）晚收高四十一元、嗣在混亂中升至六千四百六十五元、又退至六千四百四十五元、公大·大豐·祥和傾進、義豐傾向補進、價步趨上哄至六千四百九十元、爲大豐·成記·新豐永·祥興永賣出、十點半爲六千四百七十三元、不意義元傾進更勇、大豐·仁承永亦買、及聞美金軟至五元三一二五、價遂飛出六千五百元外、升達六千五百廿元、午刻天元加碼猛售、祥興永爭出、外匯稍回硬、價即回退至六千四百九十元、十二點午收六千五百元、下午二點開市、即在抬風中高十五元、計六千五百十五元、爲抬價之散戶回吐、壓小至六千五百〇二元、義元又來少進、恒記·益大·合盛爭買、及聞本月美金五元二八一二五難結、散戶再起拖進、漲勢更銳、又飛上六十八元、升至六千五百七十元、後有日艦集中旅順消息、義元轉來與天兀及新豐永狂售、始止漲回降至六千五百五十元、三點半收市六千五百五十一元、比假前尙猛撳一百四十二元、照七月美金五元二八一二五結價、爲六千五百九十四元、計撳四十三元、收後天元等再售、退至六千五百三十五元、當日有一百廿五元上落、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高二百九十元、收進比售出低七十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>一時稱盛</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價猛漲、英美金鎊因亦各升一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票開盤四角三分、開後祥源永同興行順源洽豐等爭購、抬至六角九分、正大永豐售出、退至六角一分、午牧六角四分、午後開盤六角一分、開後牲　永和順源正大永豐等買進、拾至八角二分、後因了結售出、收槃退爲十八元七角七分、比假前計漲三角四分、現貨仍須减低三角左右、香港票趨勢穩定、市價站平、日金票一跌即漲、晚市高至一元九角二分、朝鮮票略趨漲勢、晚市爲一元五角七分、</p>
<h3>紗花自現紗巿塲受打擊　金雙馬期紗得抬頭　成交額增至三萬包　巿盤亦大紗而特漲</h3>
<p>紗市續堅、且趨勢始平繼漲、此因空頭紗號、倒閉甚多、額子缺乏、補空者允衆、同時粤幫需要鼎盛、所以二三支紗價步步上騰、又漲二三十元、於是人心振作、市盤乃邁步前進、不過有一部份仍嫌其價高稍有拋空、然原棉情况有漲無跌、廠方成本提高、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百四十二元、低價爲一千五百九十四元、午後市塲集會者寥寥、初做一千六百三十元、漲至一千六百四十五元、最後價爲一千六百二十五元、目前紗市、就實際而論、基礎當可鞏固、以爲有一部份二十支紗缺貨之故、及棉花價格之一時不易鬆動、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開巿象平澹無奇、首盤價為一千六百零五元、漲至一千六百零八元、此時賣者紛紛、回跌至一千五百九十四元、然大戶補空允衆、旋以匯票改縮、金價上升、同時粤幫實銷興旺、由此買氣轉熾、市盤步步上漲至一千六百四十二元、中途盈利者吐出、又復回小一些、爲一千六百二十七元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千包、比金雙馬期貨成交已减少二萬餘包、此因最近在抬軋空之後、多空皆不敢下手、而乃集中於期貨市塲、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一、〇〇〇　同行　七、〇〇〇總計　八、〇〇〇</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗巿况、自現紗巿塲受打擊、大為堅挺此因現貨銷路良好、人心激昂、空頭抵補、多頭活動、市盤乃大漲矣、結果七月期漲四十元、八月期漲十九元、九月期新上塲、查全日成交二萬九千九百八十包、比假前增一萬三千九百三十包、茲將其一日高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>最高　最低　收盤</p>
<p>七月　一五〇一　一四　〇　一四九八</p>
<p>八月　一五一五　一四七五　一四八八</p>
<p>九月　一五五二　一五〇八　一五一七</p>
<h3>棉巿靑雲直上</h3>
<p>現棉情况、直上靑雲、此因紗市旣漲、而美棉又復回上、加以外滙標金各種利於多頭、於是棉商心思堅昂萬丈、所以細絨棉價逐見新高峰、</p>
<p>滬埠洋行外棉交易、良以紗市漲勢方興未艾、同時廠方需貨殷切、而滬埠存底不多、外棉交易實已轉人佳境、不論粗細絨原料一般羅致現貨者、均頗興奮熱烈、至於外商紗廠而直接購自海外者、雖然定購情况、似因運輸不便、噸位稀少而稍遜色、但因美棉高漲、及製成品貿易情形良好、則人心一致看高、實相同也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市活潑而堅定、因棉產收獲統計利於多頭而漲、昨日收盤價格、較之上日的漲十磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市不定、收盤價格、榮辱互見、晨初先因棉商賣出及多頭了結而跌、繼之叉因大戶支持回漲、續後市况再因空頭賣出而跌、同時又因經紀商買進再漲、結果收盤價格、漲跌一二羅比不等、</p>
<h3>疋頭　染廠辦布加濃　東疋收盤前　驀地起風沒</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨開步漲、午後微回、蓋以連日布價上漲甚勁、囤戶及同業染廠納胃加濃、廠盤開價續見提升、申新廠開出七月份期貨富貴細布四十六元二角半、富貴斜紋四十三元、較上决開價漲二元至二元二角半、怡和廠開出八月份九磅至十六磅、各檔粗布價照上批增每疋一元半至二元、共計二千餘件、細布·斜紋·粗布漲二角半至七角半、漂染布漲五角之譜、本街成交各布四百餘件、粤港南洋幫辦色布·色斜·漂布·花布等五百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　狂升疾退、變化莫測、蓋晨開取引所期布盤盤上升、後市繼續向昂、至三盤高峰時、較週一收盤各月在跳每疋二元左右、不意驀地傳來日艦集中旅順一帶消息、空戶乘機猛拋、收盤時一蹶不振、直瀉二元許、結果本月仍漲一元、九月份反跌二角半、現貨市塲龍頭細布最高見五十一元一角、最低見四十九元二角、收盤爲四十九元六角、軋跌每疋三角、色貨四君子嗶嘰一度升騰至一元六角六分二釐半、晚收回至一元六角二分、</p>
<h3>糧食　米巿塲一起一伏　終於相劑於平</h3>
<p>昨日滴米在平穩中、繼續盤砌、初漲後疲、結果又比前市漲起一元之譜、早晨開市後、本街有公賣港米之供應、納胃仍淡、惟客幫進取甚貪、內地寗波南洋鄕莊均有點綴外、漢口及長江一帶又有新起辦裝、投機客囤趁機活動、市乃立即上升、漲起一元至近二元不等然漲後即有大戶吐出、而獲利多頭之了結與新到之散戶售意更鬆、市乃起而復落、英華司二號暹邏一百四十二元半、小絞九一百四十九元半、期一百四十九元、碎米一百十三元半至一百十三兀、均比前日較犬一元之譜、一號現西貢一百二十九元、二號西貢曾開至百二十三元、小絞百二十四元、惟實銷淸淡、內地鄕莊等幫見市價復昂、心思轉懈、又都停手、而本街店胃仍着意於平米、延至後市、卒告回貶、結果收盤視夫各價先後一起一伏、與前市比較、猶見相仿、計一號西貢爲百二十六七元、二號高自百二十二元决至百十　元、一號暹邏百二十五元、特別百三十一二元、二號百二十一元、百二十元、火紋百二十五六元，茄佛米百二十六元半、百二十六元、敏黨中關百二十六元、小紋百二十二元半、百二十二元、東京砶尖中關百十二元、百十元、碎尖九十五六元、米菉百十一元、全日成交二萬二千包、英華司原包則爲一千二百噸云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、到貨依然寥落、致貨主見早巿滴米續昂、售心更堅、扳喊殊力、而木鄕店銷、初則納意亦濃、因是雖後一動即懈、而結果厚薄兩粳行情、尙能見增元砠、開南港新鮮早晚稻百三十七元半、百三十六元、無錫原包宿粳百三十二元决至百二十七元、</p>
<p>糯米在滴米繼緊之際、其香港白元云路突亦轉旺、不獨零胃如此、　有躉數交易、當時形勢殊緊、售價與洋米並駕齊驅、提高一二元，不通後市亦屬不振、還趨平穩，計昨全市做開各價高自百二十一二元、次至中關百十八元，糯菉高自百十二元、决至百零六元、國糯仍以時令及身骨關係、難與洋糯並論、猶屬平淡、繼開高自百二十一二元、决至百十八元、</p>
<p>洋米又有大量到滬、法國郵船公司開定號輪、由西貢裝米二萬七千包、昨晨到埠、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、尙有大批仰光洋米日內可到（祖）</p>
<h3>粉巿步步上展　——三日中漲起一元左右——</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、步趨上展、蓋自華廠平賣粉停止發售後、本街實銷漸增、更兼米市報升、散浮吸收者頗不乏人、惟大幫客銷、尙未發動、故其漲勢尙不過烈、全市做開金龍粉三十三元至三十三地零五分、浦東棧三十二元七角、砲台粉三十三元八九角、新由香港運來之五燕牌美粉開價三十三元四角、鐘樓牌喊價三十四元、雙鷹粉三十三元、成交一萬四五千包、以上各貨比上日悉漲三五角不等、三天中已漲起一元光景、其餘雜牌冷牌、亦各升半元左右、惟目下存粉充斥、香港來源不絕、市面前途、亦暫乏過好之局面、小麥無市、</p>
<h3>雜糧　食油又起囤風　苞米內運不絕</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、被星挺昂、　以一般擁資者受金融市塲流言之刺激、囤貨觀念驟又殷切、行情遂被抬高一二元、計售開膠州生油五十件、價爲一百廿二元、江北本坊生油七百聽、價一百七十六元、大德新廠淸油價四百担、一百廿元、大有廠淸油七月下交二千担、價一百廿元零五角、至一百廿三元五角、</p>
<p>苞米昨市內運不絕、甬幫亦有躉額採辦、致交易頗活、行情一致挺升半元左右、統市成交西貢及荷蘭苞米共四千包强、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<h3>糖巿　食糖進戶頗衆</h3>
<p>昨糖市進戶頗衆、故人心向榮、致趨勢繼續向上猛展、太古洋行開出即裝荷赤一千五百包、價爲美金三元零五分、照CL．F．例、叉信益公司開出八九月份到之粗砂八千包、價爲美金三元七角五分、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、最近到之新貨、開盤九十二元三角至九十三元·四元·五元最後收盤、小五角、爲九十四元五角、三四月份到貨九十一元至九十三元五角、升二元外、太古車白B嘜一百零九元至一百十元、升二元外、DY嘜一百零二元、裝頭一百元、升一元、HY嘜九十一元至九十二元五角、HM嘜九十九元至八十元、H嘜車赤七十一元、荷赤NT嘜七十二元五角、KD嘜七十三元五角至七十四元五角、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵　衝出五百元關</h3>
<p>市上流通之二百磅美會司鐵、現貨於半月之前、已吿軋缺、最近以還因本街玩具廠製罐廠印刷廠香烟廠餅乾廠以囤戶幫等之熱烈搜羅、流通貨更感不敷、且洋行定貨取消、來源吿絕、於是人心奇昂、市塲頓現供不應求之象、因此標準行情經數度高漲後、終於衝出五百元大關、</p>

<p>注意防疫</p>
<p>無論如何、法租界內已發生霍亂、無可否認、現衛生當局民採取各種辦法、防止疫症擴大、各居民爲己爲人、均應合作、以撲滅之、允其對飲食、應特別注意、水須沸後始可飲、食物應煮熟妥藏、避免蒼蠅接觸、因蒼蠅爲著名致病之媒介物、以足及吸液管、傳播霍亂細菌、如息此病病人、應送入時疫醫院、絕對隔離、可疑之糞、應用化學物（來沙而）消毒、爲避免霍亂起見、故吾人有受防疫注射之必要、上述婦人之事、使吾人得下列三秤敎訓、（一）防疫注射須經過若干時期、始能發生效力、此時間的爲十五日、（二）注射劑須含相當已死之菌苗及分量、方始有效、故對於注射後之小反應、不應害怕、（三）防疫注射、縱不能盡免病症之發生、但至少可使病勢大爲减輕、此上述婦人之所以能痊愈、而未受防疫注射之少女、則終至於死亡也、</p>

<h3>近日氣候變幻劇烈　颶風抵呂宋島　濕度打破紀錄　滬西積潦未盡</h3>
<p>太平洋繼起第二颶風、已於昨晨六時、進抵呂宋島以東、繼續向北西方向進行中、據徐家匯天文台昨晨六時報告、颶風現抵方位、爲北緯十七度、東經一百二十三度、風力中心在六十海哩以內、有六個至七個風力、如循北西方向進行不變、我國沿海將被襲擊、</p>
<p>低氣壓昨過滬</p>
<p>叉據大通社記者向徐家匯天文台探悉、起於江西省東部之低氣壓、已於昨晨五時從上海之西面進過疾入黃海、故上海風向已轉，天氣可望回爽、</p>
<p>濕度竟達九成</p>
<p>本埠連日因霉雨影響氣候、潮濕異常各堆棧囤積貨物、巳受嚴重影響、囤貨者均受威脅、據大通社記者向天文台探悉、近日空氣濕度、已超過紀錄、本月一日爲百分之七十二至八十九、　日爲百分之七十五至九十、一般堆存貨物、受此潮濕、均極易霉爛、</p>
<p>西區積水難退</p>
<p>本埠自數度盛雨後滬西越界築路一帶各馬路多積水成患、近日驟雨後積水允多、現愚園路地豐路安和寺路凱旋路哥倫比亞路一帶低窪馬路、積水均未退盡、大爲行人之患、雖天時轉晴、惟尚無退落之望、</p>

<p>减息辦法並不一律</p>
<p>各銀行錢莊爲减輕利息上之負擔、自去年下半年起、實行减低活存利息後、今又將以前所定之存款優待辦法取消、並自七月起、將領用支票之活存利息、再行减低至二厘、定期存款則减低自五厘至二分、惟各銀行錢莊並不完全一律、由於各行莊參酌市面情形、各自訂定、但定期存款已與存戶訂定利息者、則照已訂定之利息計算、俟滿期後如欲轉期、則須照新訂利率額實行、又存款過期不取、不於期外計息、</p>

<h3>朱葆山路一酒排間　白俄法兵衝突　白俄舉杯高呼俄國萬歲　雙方誤會動武幸即平息</h3>
<p>法租界朱葆三路、酒排問與舞塲林立、其顧客大都爲西人與各國士兵、自前年第二决歐戰發生後、英法兩租界與軍界當局、爲防止交戰國士兵於酒後發生糾粉、爲消弭不幸事件、會劃定界限、令交戰國士兵各依界限飲酒消遣、不得混涉、</p>
<p>擎杯慶祝</p>
<p>茲據傳聞、自德蘇戰爭發生後、前晚朱葆三路之酒吧間內、曾發生士兵鬬毆事件、緣有白俄一羣、於是夜至朱葆三路某俄商所設之酒吧間內歡飲、正興高彩烈、舉杯慶祝紅軍勝利、高呼俄國萬歲之時、一白俄舉杯至法國籍某水兵前、請乾此一杯酒、竟遭拒絕、兩人遂生誤會、致起齟齬、</p>
<p>誤會衝突</p>
<p>當由同伴白俄趨前排解、而在塲之法國水兵多名、擁上援助、其同伴各舉桌椅酒瓶等物毆擊白俄、聲達於戶外、經派駐該處之捕房探捕得悉、入內勸止、一塲糾紛、乃告平息、兩方遂即散去、歷時的十分鐘、恢復秩序、</p>
<h3>紹興飢饉荐臻　急需糧食接濟</h3>
<p>自浙東一部份地方淪陷後、人民顚沛流離、莫知所措、尤以糧食恐慌、爲空前所未有、大有析子易炊之境象、本市紹興餘姚兩同鄉會、鑒於梓鄉受災之慘重、誼不能坐視、曾向本埠紅卍字會請求聯合救濟辦法、蓋以該會素在寗波鎭海餘姚紹與上虞等縣、均設有分會、與商協同救濟、自較事半功倍、昨據卍字會負資人告平明社記者稱、浙東方面、需要最殷者、莫如糧食一項、目下正在籌款購米、同時更向美國紅十字會方面請求先撥美麥一部份、以舒燃眉之急、但有最感困難者、目前滬浙交通阻隔、運輸不便、現正在積極設法、以便得早日運往接濟、至該會現下浙東之救濟情形、近無詳細報告、茲將所知大略，誌之於后、</p>
<p>（紹興）目下餘姚郵雷未通、當地如何、莫能道其究竟、惟紅卍字會及同鄉會方面、曾於淪陷之前、各滙款十萬元至該地辦理施粥塲及振濟事項、此款雖電覆收到、但旋即發生事變、迄今情况不明、至於紹興方面、亦無消息、惟聞該地飢民充斥、餓殍載道、該會僅對於掩埋工作一項、頗爲繁忙、惟聞</p>
<p>（上虞）在上月十日左右、城中曾遭一次大洗刦、繼以放火、房屋燒毀多處以致難民流離失所者、滿望皆是、現紅卐字會已在城南及百官兩地、設收容所二處、收容難胞　百餘人、同時浙江當局、以當地積有存糧、正在四鄉辦理平糶事宜、</p>

<h3>戰事蔓延生產減退　英美採辦華貨　滬國貨工廠已積極接洽</h3>
<p>自蘇德戰事猝發後、歐洲各參戰國、均已趕製戰時所需物品、以致各類日用品生產量已無形减退、非特無法轉運國外銷售、抑且將每日所需之日用物品、設法仰購於國外、本市各大小國貨工廠、鑒於際斯</p>
<p>戰亂之時</p>
<p>推銷精美國貨時期已屆、現已個別改進品質、次第增加生產、據悉邇日除南洋各屬地紛紛來電訂購鉅額精美國貨外、並英美商人、亦有來電訂購日用物品、惟裝運物品船隻、現甫由有關各國貨公團積極接洽中、俾按期</p>
<p>源源運往</p>
<p>昨據某國貨巨子語稱、本巿整個國貨事業、因受滬戰影響、歷年來頗萎縮不振、內銷固感苦悶、而南銷亦時受波折、非輪隻稀尠、無法大量運往、即國際局勢不靖、訂貨者裹足、本市各國貨工廠在此種局面之下、鮮有長足進展、茲外銷旣趨暢旺、內銷尚有挽回餘地、故各大小國貨工廠、莫不將所有出品、力求科學化、以期盡善盡美、競銷市塲、冀獲優勝地位、故目前即以小型襪廠一業而論、成立者如雨後春笋、</p>

<h3>參觀行夏書畫展覽續紀（魯）</h3>
<p>昨晨大雨，家居無聊，披閱申報，見浦東大厦有行夏書畫展覽之舉，遂驅車前往，周歷參觀，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收，雖走馬看花，然亦略得該會書畫家之一般焉。</p>
<p>陳列作品之中，尤以戴敬庵思恭之作品，精神飽滿，器局開展，其結構之渾成，用筆之沉着，直合徐天池·張船山·趙撝叔·諸家之長，而鎔冶一爐。其百齡圖，雄深穩健，兼得宋元名家之神髓；其他蔬果瓶花諸小品，亦莫不栩栩若生。項激雲之小楷，細如蠅頭，秀挺整凈，實爲當代聖手；即如儒釋道三經，墨筆篆文孝經，墨筆古本大學，均係袖珍小册，摺疊後藏錢夾中也；十六方扇面，每方能書五行，可謂小矣。</p>
<p>此外如閔瑞芝之法書，凝練秀逸，力透紙背，非有大功夫大氣力者，不能望其項背。更有黃雲佾隸書對聯，古茂樸實，絕無縱橫習氣。而允愛雲僧之梅蘭竹石，雖著墨不多，而天趣盎然，想見其閒情逸致，恬淡詼諧之胸襟，完全流露於筆墨中也。朱積誠之書畫鐵筆，亦爲會中傑出之作品，書法則雄肆渾厚，鐵筆則古樸秀挺，不愧斵輪老手。又如蔣潤身之人物山水，亦爲近時所罕見，其素描人物，無異從宋元畫　中來，即山水品秀麗可喜，殊爲難得。其餘作家雖不勝枚舉，但更有幾位作家爲余所素知，亦爲社會所稔知者，不能不於此略舉焉，毛遂華女士，爲馮超然之高足，長於士女，亦善山水，蓋名師所傳，並得心法，天然不同凡響也。朱芾甘雖爲張大千善孖之高足，其研究山水，獨感興趣，故深得其師三昧，丁冠顏爲吳門陳迦庵之高足，至於翎毛花卉，其作品素爲世所珍貴。范希仲長於竹石，爲楊東山之高足，東山老名士，宜其爲高弟也。又劉絜女士，爲鄧糞翁之高弟，其書法甚工，一如其師。此外張叔通之作品，陳列不多，僅有數幅，而其最爲精美者，厥爲扇面，此種扇面，即置諸明淸作家中，亦絕無愧色也。更有孔子及木道人之眞跡，懸掛正廳，此是神來之筆，與衆不同，足爲該會生色不少。余參觀該會，共費三四小時之久，時已向午，只得僱車而返，無暇一一拜讀矣。</p>

<p>平靜的衖裏遽然起了騷擾，原來大房東又出了新花樣，分幢出售，每幢八千四百元——其實是出賣十四年的居住權，按目下房租每月五十元計算，共得八千四百元。</p>
<p>如意算盤還你面目</p>
<p>八千四百元的售價合理嗎？當然不。第一，房東故意忽略了利息。按照中國銀行一整存零存儲蓄存款」的利率和方法來計算，衹要現在存入了五千塊錢多一點，今後的十四年間已可於期初向銀行提起五十塊錢一月的本息了，何况市塲利率要高於銀行存息。第二，按照民法的規定，出租人對於租賃物負有修繕的義務，可見目下的房租中必已包括修繕費用在內，因此假使房東要把居住權出售，應將這一部份的修繕費用在售價中减去。第三，一次繳付，房東可省却不少麻煩，售價自應减低，這與躉售價格應較零售價格低廉同理。</p>
<p>全衖二房東不甘示弱，全體總動員開會討論，當然大多數頭腦淸醒的二房東都力持反對，但是也有少數「瘟闊老」竟毫不思索「慷慨」地承買了，因爲非如此不足表現他們的「闊」</p>
<p>體察下情加租　成</p>
<p>幾度折衝之後，總算房東還能「體察下情」，允予收回成命，但是又提出了新要求，加租五成！理由很充足：</p>
<p>一·由於房價的高漲，這五十塊錢一月的房租，扣去折舊之後，還合不到年利四釐，利子太轉了！</p>
<p>二·鈔票太那個……</p>
<p>欺人自欺，似是而非的所謂「理由」能使誰心服呢？關於第一點，由於房產的自然漲價，房東已不勞而坐享了鉅額的意外利益，假使在這意外的利益上再要加算利息，那也未免太狠心了吧？因此，房東除了負有向政府繳納不動產自然增價稅的義務外，絕沒有理由，要求加租。關於第點，顯然是房東不明事實，要知道幣値與物價是互爲因果的，幣値的下降固足使物價高騰，可是物價的上漲也足使幣値低落，因此要避免幣値的續降，唯有制化物價的上騰，所以幣値的下跌爲加租的理由，也不够充分</p>
<p>七折優待麻煩正多</p>
<p>理智不敵房東無窮的慾望，費盡了口舌，才獲七折的「優待」，加租三成牛，當然，對於這「旣成事實」已不容我再提抗議，可是我願望這「少加房租的優待」，不要像辣斐德路某衖一樣，係向帳房間行賄而來。</p>
<p>租加了，衖裹的騷擾也平息了，但是誰能保證將來決不會有第一次騷擾的發生呢？（却酬）</p>
<h3>「重負」？</h3>
<p>— 星雲</p>
<p>拿了一隻香噴噴的大麵包，在路上走，多少總是件「危險」的事，於是我將牠緊抱在懷裹，兩手交叉着摟住了，低着頭忽忽地走。我只怕有一隻黑手突然來攫取我底「生命錢」，但是，假使給同學熟人看見這副「窘態」，多少總有點難堪。</p>
<p>似乎是「天公不美」吧，迎面正遇着個同學，一個富家的哥兒，『密斯脫星，好呀……噫爲什麼將那麵包　得那麼緊？壓扁了可不好吃的。』『不好說，路上癟三太多，稍一大意，那麵包準會「不翼而飛」的』。』癟三要搶東西？——』他凝神地說：『難道不怕法律嗎？』。</p>
<p>『這倒……不知道，好在，嗯，好在你的哥哥是大律師，您去問問他吧……我還有點事，少陪了，再會』。回頭看他還在靜思。</p>
<p>『再會』他從「夢」中醒來，『眞難得，這位少爺竟肯注意這件「小事」』我想。</p>
<p>跑到了家裹，麵包下了肚，如釋重負，心上一塊石頭「碰」的跌在地上。</p>
<h3>投機指南　國際相法　潤格何弗外匯計算　足下且宜講些盤子</h3>
<p>— 蠡抱</p>
<p>下午五點鐘，一天的工作又宣告完結，同時老胡要去拜訪山林隱逸的一流了。</p>
<p>老胡近來很相信這些，我知道他前些日子不知在那兒做了五條多頭虧了本，可眞怪！一虧本，就好上了這些。所學則「自幼得異人傳授」，據說，這一次到上海，就是從爪哇國（？）來的。實際上，他的學術似乎也早臻「化境」。</p>
<p>走進××大厦〇〇〇號房間，我底眼界一新，一進門有隻收銀櫃，里面兩問才是談相的地方；看樣子頗有幾分類似醫院。</p>
<p>老胡拿出兩塊錢，但收錢的那一位在問過尊姓大名那一套之後，忽然說：「先生，附加手續費三成。」</p>
<p>老胡回過頭來望着我，意思好似說：「居然還耍小賬？」</p>
<p>我不響，跟老胡一塊進了里面的套間　相室。自然，開頭免不了幾句客套，慢慢地才逼近正題。這一位鼻子不高的星相家開始用華語說：「老兄預備談那一種？兄弟這里的潤格是——你瞧！從十塊到一千塊。聽便！」</p>
<p>「你報上不是說二塊麼？我已經在外頭繳過了。」</p>
<p>「不錯，那是掛號，這里的規矩，相金面議。」</p>
<p>「這麼貴！」老胡看着那張不知是誰代訂的潤格很驚訝地說。這一位的語氣郤有點近于調侃：</p>
<p>「貴？不貴呀！兄弟這里前幾天都是以港幣計算，現在才改了上海錢，要是照原例，那可更貴了，一塊錢得劃法幣四塊七角半。」</p>
<p>於是他們且不談相，開始講盤子；結果，老胡來了個最起碼的十塊，科目是「略論流年」。不知怎麼着，當外面那一位跑來「叨光現惠」的時候，又附帶微收去手續費三成。老胡一共花了十五塊六毛。他所得到的是甚麼呢？——「尊駕這副臉，天庭飽滿，地角方圓，好比一個同字，照相看，一生穿吃不愁。……不過，印堂發暗。不奉承，目前似乎不大順吧？……若到八九月間，可以步入佳境……」</p>
<p>踏上電梯，老胡噓了一口氣，他似乎在這不着邊際的江湖術語中已經找到滿足了，我呢，更滿足：一個子兒不花，使我學會談相。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>秋海棠雖然一個英文字也沒有念過，聽不懂他們在說的是什麼東西，但聽着倒也覺得很有趣。</p>
<p>梅寳旁邊坐着的一個女學生，突然隔着玻璃窗，瞧見了秋海棠，便暗暗向梅寳做了個眼色，梅寳忙立刻回過頭來，向窗外發出了叉是羞澀，又是高興的一笑。</p>
<p>「梅寳，是我啊？」他差不多就要想這樣喊起來了。</p>
<p>當梅寳第二度再旋過臉來看他時，秋海棠的臉已緊緊地貼在玻璃窗上了，</p>
<p>「吳梅影？」正當他父女倆隔着窗子，互相戀戀不捨的在觀望的時候，講台上的先生，突然這樣高叫起來；慌得秋海棠幾乎馬上想躱開，一面叉害怕這樣會使先生責怪自己的愛女。</p>
<p>「誰也說不完全，還是你說給我聽聽吧？」先生堆出了很溫和的笑容說，顯然他還沒有發現窗外的秋海棠，即使已經發現的話，他也沒有責怪梅影的意思。</p>
<p>「Shall，will　auxiliary　verb，receive，find，transitive　verb；talk，smile，intransitive　verb；snows，rains，impersonal　verb」梅寳打座位上站起來，二連串的說出了許多英文字，聽在秋海棠的耳朶裹，眞像一個小外國人一樣。「好得很，坐下去吧？」先生揮揮手，一面敎梅寳坐下去，一面向別的許多學生說：「吳梅影眞是最用功的學生，所以她每决總考第一。你們馬上就要畢業了，連四種動詞都還說不完全，大家年紀都比吳梅影大，爲什麼一個也不如她呢？」（一四九）</p>

<h3>影人參戰後的觀感</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>在這次歐戰中，電影明星實地參戰的，却爾斯鮑育許是第一人。現在，他雖已重返影城，繼續工作；可是關於他的參戰經過，一般人均不知其詳，直到最近，在Silver　Screen雜誌上，才看到詳盡的記載。茲譯述如後：</p>
<p>赴法攝片</p>
<p>當却爾斯鮑育在好萊塢拍完了「何日君再來」以後，他就應影片公司之請，到法國去拍“LeCarsair”一片，當時大戰尚未爆發，可是局勢已緊張到極點，戰雲瀰漫，大有一觸即發之勢。他的親友們都勸他暫時不要赴歐，且稍待歐局的演變再定行止，然而他爲了返國攝片是件很有意義的事，所以就在時局緊張聲中，毅然離美赴法了。當影片攝製到一半的時候，歐洲的形勢愈益緊張，他的新片是在尼羅河畔攝製的，他看見形勢日緊，便把他的夫人送到較安全的母家去，　是他自己叉隻身回到尼羅城來繼續攝製他的新片。</p>
<p>被徵入伍</p>
<p>在大戰爆發的　夜。法國國內　行了極廣泛的　民闢動員。因　拍片工作就祇得停歇起來。　育旣然也是法國公民的一份　，當然要回到費材克城去（　的故鄉）聽候徵調了。不到　天，國民總動員就輪到了他；於是鮑育遂投編入營，其初？他不過是費材克城的守衛兵，後來被編入砲兵第三十七運，可是入營不久，就被遣送到約雄城去受初期訓練了，那時　國正以全力守衛馬奇諾陣綫。所以他經過了短期訓練之後，就跟着全隊開到前方去防守馬奇諾陣綫。</p>
<p>軍營生活</p>
<p>當他們的同伴發現了他是明星的這位「銀幕拿破崙」加以種種嘲笑。「你瞧呀！」那些砲兵說：「這是小拿破崙呀！是不是？天哪！他變得這樣厲害，這樣的可悲呀！呵！那個偉大的拿破崙先生如今只配當馬夫了。」這彷彿打了飽育一記耳光，在那些同伴們，果然是隨口而出，並無特別的惡意，可是鮑育聽了，却是滿腔不歡，但因爲軍營中紀律森嚴，夥伴間是不該吵架的所以他亦祇得充耳不聞。的確，那銀幕上咤叱風雲的拿破崙，那時威風掃地了。</p>
<p>重返影城</p>
<p>正在他忍辱負重，與敵苦戰的當兒，命令來了：說法國在目前的怚形下，還不須四十以上的人　伍，而鮑育已四十二歲，超　了軍役年齡，遂不得不脫離　隊生活，重返影城，從事他　小業了。雖然他身居異國，但對祖國江山仍是殷殷懷念，他曾經對記者們說：「唉！巴黎的景色，多麼够人留念，可是砲聲一響，天空的炸彈直垂下來，美麗而和平的田野粉碎了，龐大的軍隊因撤退而喪生，沒有一個倖免。成千成萬的無家可歸者，到處奔逃的難民，正像受驚的獸羣，除非是困乏到熟睡時，大家才噤若寒蟬的一聲不響，那種慘狀，使我至死不忘。現在我仍然預備着藍灰色的軍衣，準備參加自由法軍，無論是趕馬，掘戰壕，或用以充當納粹的砲灰，任何命運我都在期待着。因爲無論怎樣，我終是一個自由法蘭西人啊！」</p>
<h3>血雨瓊苑</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第十二章　盡如寗武可奈何</p>
<p>劉氏也是將門之女，玉顏淸麗，略諳武術，年紀和周遇吉同庚。以前曾和周遇吉並轡出獵，佩劍懸弓，儼然姽嫿將軍。伊很欲相隨丈夫殺賊，祇因周遇吉堅囑伊侍奉婆婆，代替子職，所以不克如願哩。母子夫婦父子見面行禮之後，老太太摩挲老眼，向周遇吉臉上身上仔細看了一下，方纔說道：「吾兒不在代州鎭守，回來做甚？周遇吉聞言，不由一驚，方知他母親尚未明白原因。但現在此事無可隱諱的，遂瞧了劉氏一眼，把流寇攻破代州，自己退守寗武的事，的略禀告一通。劉氏在旁忙向伊婆婆請罪。老太太點點頭道：「原來如此。你當然要爲國盡忠，保衛地方的只是流寇之勢這樣猖獗，未可輕視。」周遇吉道：「寡固不可以敵衆，實在我們的兵馬太少了，我已向朝廷乞援，又差人往大同總兵姜壤那邊去討救兵，可是消息沉沉，不見有一兵一卒到來。代州已被攻破，此關恐難久守，孩兒爲國戰死，固無遺恨，祇因白髮萱親不能保護，是以萬恨千愁，十分徬徨。想要遣兒子伴送母親到他州外郡去暫避幾時，免得在此徒受驚恐，不知母親的意思怎樣？老太太聽了伊兒子之言，嘆了一口氣說道：「吾聞當初王陵之母尚能敎子成名，難道我這暮年人偏還戀着夕陽寸光，不能够作成兒子的忠良嗎？古語云：「盡忠不能盡孝」，在這個兵臨城下的時候，你守土有責，快些去一心殺賊，莫要戀戀於你的老母。你若戰死沙塲，他日名垂靑史，周氏一門也有榮光。寗武若不能守，我也願死在這裹，不肯遠避而苟活的。我把古人說與你聽；在東晋之時，蘇峻跋扈，興兵犯闕，那時候大夫卞壺，忠義不屈，仗劍獨和蘇峻戰於闕下而死。卞壺的兒子髮妻都跟着殉節呢。（一〇六）</p>
<h3>評「求婚」與「鍍金」</h3>
<p>— 淸心</p>
<p>喧傳劇界已久的「求婚」與「鍍金」，已匆匆地演出了。這是兩齣喜劇，所以在演出的時候，笑聲不絕，觀衆都爲之捧腹。</p>
<p>「求婚」，是獨幕劇，雖是那麼短短的一點，可是它描寫出社會上趨炎附勢的卑鄙的淺見，和土豪劣紳們貪小的心理，無微不至。的確，在「只重衣衫不重人」的塲合下，今日竟產生不少的守財奴，常常會把財產套在頸圈上過日子的；至於李守貞在知道了趙寳貴的來意，便急得那樣手足無措，眞是十足的孩子氣。不過還有一點商榷的地方，在這裏李二爺的裝着腿痛，聽了趙寳貴的聲明來意之後，便毫不轉彎地跳起，這好像是嫌直率一些。其餘劇中所飾的兩個殘廢者——趙寳貴（跛子）李守貞（曲背），技術方面，都有相當的收穫</p>
<p>「鍍金」，是雙幕笑劇，爲名作劇家曹禺所改編，其中描寫的馬壽卿醫士那樣的戇直，沒有本領，（開藥方竟會寫上了西菜名，這不是成了笑話嗎？）至於家產方面，從傢具起都是他人之物；而且還雇人裝着病人，以掩飾門可羅雀的蕭條光景，更恬不知恥的大事吹牛，嘴裏橫一個行長，豎一個大人，這種情形，在今日的孤島上，正是不乏光例的。及至兩家訪親的時候，雙方都是「打腫了充胖子」的人，而結果又都露出了馬脚，險將好事閙成了悲劇後幸趙二叔那樣的快人快語，敎訓他們，對於現代好事舖張，不務實際的人們，眞是對症下藥。在演員的技術方面，向來以小白臉出現在觀衆面前的韓非，居然這次飾出了一個半新不舊的老頭兒，眞是有趣。而柏李扮演的馬太太，也很自然，是値得提起的；穆宏所飾的印度人，無論在姿態和裝束上，都很逼眞，幾使人不相信他是一個中國男兒了。其他，在天然所飾出的趙文明，雖是很有些像浪子型的人物，但是，在動作方面，總要趨於自然的好，他如果達到這一點的話，保證他前途會透露出一綫的曙光。</p>

<p>高雪樵　天蟾勇猛武生高雪樵內外人緣均不惡，隸該臺演唱亦最久，猶憶高伶首次來滬在鄭家木橋老共舞臺，懸牌第一，編排「大刀王五」新戲，轟動一時，論其武工，甚有根底，「驅車戰將」一劇，尤屬傑作。「七劍十三俠」中之一枝梅和「金鏢黃天霸」之天覇，極合身份，故聲譽之日隆，深爲當局所重視，最近宋寳羅貼演全本「武鄉侯」，雪樵去姜維一角，氣魄雄偉，邊式身架殊佳，似較客冬楊瑞亭在大舞臺星期日一度演「鐵龍山」去此角爲上，蓋高伶正年富力强耳。</p>
<p>梁慧超　梁慧超今番重隸更新舞臺，藝益精進，短打長靠各戲，皆守繩規，絕無外江派氣息，「葭萌關」之馬超，予覺其演來最好。「金錢豹」自係拿手戲，但配演孫悟空之某角，未免减色不斟；所謂牡丹雖好，還須綠葉扶持也。現在「新西遊記」中所去各角，亦極受觀者之讚賞。</p>
<p>張翼鵬　張翼鵬有「活猴」之雅號，然目下伶人能演猴劇者，固不僅翼鵬一人，王桂卿也算不錯，第功力之深，與夫逼眞之神情，終難望其項背、「活猴」之稱，確非溢譽，而當之無愧。「四平山」「雅觀樓」「武松」「智取北湖州」諸劇，皆大有可觀。年來張以地位旣高，非挑大樑則不幹。外傳與乃父蓋叫天向來情感冷淡，然證諸最近兩月間時往省視父病，可知翼鵬孝思之一斑。</p>

<h3>International Situation Becomes Clearer After China Breaks Off Relations with Germany and Italy; Anti-Aggression Front Completed; Tensions Between the United States and Japan Further Increase</h3>
<p>Chongqing - China's severance of diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy is regarded today as making the overall international situation clearer, no different from the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. China can now openly and completely oppose the Axis powers, thus completing the anti-aggression front. China's policy has long tended in this direction, but due to the maintenance of normal diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, it had to observe diplomatic niceties. Based on this situation, the tendency of China's international policy could not be fully announced to the Chinese public. This complexity has now been eliminated. It is expected that future announcements regarding China's international stance will be simple and direct. China cannot tolerate the actions of the Axis powers, but Chongqing seems to have some regret regarding the severance with Germany, as China has not forgotten the practical assistance that Germany provided in the early stages of the war. This is not influenced by Berlin's official policy towards the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China obtained a large amount of military equipment and other supplies from Germany, and German military advisors were particularly helpful in the early stages of the war in China. There are also a large number of people, some of whom hold responsible positions, who either studied in Germany or believe that China should imitate Germany militarily and politically. However, these people have remained silent in recent months, and some may have changed their views. All of them, of course, strongly support the government's severance of relations with the Axis powers. There is much less regret expressed regarding China's severance of relations with Italy. Since Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, China responded by assisting the League of Nations in imposing sanctions, and Sino-Italian relations have been nominal. The Italian side has frankly admitted that Italy's policy on the Sino-Japanese War has always been to promote peace in the Far East, causing China to submit to Japan. According to what was learned today, after Germany's attempt to mediate peace failed when the Chinese government was still in Hankou, the Italian diplomatic side also worked to promote peace. Although it was unsuccessful, Sino-Italian relations did not improve as a result. The Italian ambassador to China never presented his credentials in Chongqing, which further strained Sino-Italian relations. At 8:00 PM yesterday, a special reception was held for the press, during which Shao Yulin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, read out the Chinese government's declaration of severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The atmosphere was very tense. Shao said that Ling Qihan, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at that time handed Guo Taiqi's declaration and passport to Nolte, Secretary of the German Embassy, and the Secretary of the Italian Embassy. The German Chargé d'Affaires Leisen is in Chengdu, but it is understood that he will return to Chongqing immediately. German reporters did not attend the press conference. It is understood that Haitong News Agency has ceased its services since yesterday. The spokesman declared that the embassies of the Axis countries have been notified that the Chinese government will provide them with all kinds of convenience to leave China via Vietnam. The Chongqing Municipal Government and the Garrison Command have been ordered to do their best to protect the embassy personnel until they withdraw, and the authorities in all cities where German and Italian residents reside have also been ordered to provide protection to them while they remain there. The spokesman also said that the issue of overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy is currently under consideration, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also take all necessary steps regarding the German news agencies in Chongqing. The spokesman also said that a statement is not yet ready regarding the protection of the interests of the Axis powers in China and China's interests in the Axis countries. The diplomatic community today does not believe the prevailing view in Chongqing that the Axis's move is intended to induce Japan to attack the Soviet Union. It is believed here that the main purpose of the recognition is to make the Japanese public believe that there has been some genuine progress in resolving the China issue. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Pro-German Faction in Japan Gains Advantage</p>
<p>New York - The New York Minsheng Forum newspaper recently published an article stating that the Axis countries' recognition of Nanjing has made Germany more biased towards Japan in the Far Eastern war. It also stated that it is credible that the result of the ten-day debate on policy issues in Tokyo has shown that the pro-German faction has the upper hand, and it is feared that Japan will announce a policy that will disturb the United States. The newspaper also believes that Hitler has already paid the price for his demand for Japan's help by recognizing Nanjing in this way. Hitler can then demand that Japan take bold actions to eliminate the enthusiasm of the United States to participate in the Atlantic war. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - News today stated that Japan's announcement of simultaneously respecting the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, is the result of an agreement between Tokyo and Berlin. According to the agreement, Japan may continue to work to prevent the United States from participating in the European war in return for the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing. Japanese believe that Germany and Italy's recognition of Nanjing can further support Japan's policy of trying to overthrow Chongqing. However, as far as Japan is concerned, being able to resolve the China issue is its main problem. Non-Axis people believe that Germany and Italy's recognition has made it impossible for Japan to adopt an independent foreign policy. Therefore, this result can be regarded as another diplomatic victory for Germany. The Axis people in Tokyo all seem to think that whether Japan attacks the Soviet Union is insignificant. These people clearly believe that the United States' aid to the Soviet Union, reaching the West via Vladivostok, will be too late and will not help. However, these people are trying their best to strain Japanese-American relations so that the United States does not dare to participate in the European war. The Axis people here expect that as long as Japan continues to support Nanjing, US-Japan tension will inevitably increase. Because Japan's support for Nanjing is still an incompatible situation with US policy. Looking at the current increase in US aid to Chongqing, the decrease in Soviet aid to Chongqing, and the fact that the United States has become the main force behind General Chiang Kai-shek, it is even more evident that Japan's actions are incompatible with US policy. Now, the Axis's recognition of Nanjing can make Japan more actively tend towards Nanjing's support, making it more impossible for Japan and the United States to compromise on the China issue. Furthermore, the Axis's recognition of Nanjing can enable the Japanese to disregard the recent lack of military achievements and argue for their reasons for engaging in the fourth year of the war.

<p>Withdrawal of Personnel from German and Italian Embassies</p>
<p>Berlin - The official Central Daily News announced today that the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, including Ambassador Chen Jie, a total of 13 people, and the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Italy have been ordered to return to China as soon as possible. The newspaper said that then it will be decided how to return to the country. They will probably take the route through Lisbon, Portugal, and then through the United States to return to the country. There are only two Chinese consulates in the Axis countries, one in Hamburg and one in Milan, but the consular officials have not been ordered to leave. There are about nine hundred Chinese people in Germany, of whom one hundred and eighty are students. There are about five hundred overseas Chinese in Italy, most of whom are businessmen.

<p>Chongqing Newspapers Condemn Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, all newspapers unanimously published articles condemning Germany and Italy, and warmly supporting the government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. The newspapers also emphasized that Germany and Italy's recognition will not disturb international vision. China's determination and confidence in the war will be strengthened as a result, and it is vowed to thoroughly implement the determination to completely drive the Japanese army out of the country. The Central Daily News said that the measures currently adopted by the German and Italian authorities are by no means the will of the people of their countries, and it is a pity for the two peoples who hope to lead the German and Italian nations into a deep abyss. As for how Germany and Italy will collude further with Japan, there will be no criticism for the time being due to the unclear content. However, it can be predicted that even if the two sides collude, they may not be sincere, deceiving and exploiting each other, and the result will be the same demise. The Yishi Daily said that the date of Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is imminent. Japan's establishment of one more enemy is naturally beneficial to China. The National Public Newspaper regrets that it has not immediately declared war with it. The Ta Kung Pao said that Japan's request for Germany and Italy to recognize the Nanjing organization at this time is a means for Konoe and Matsuoka to consolidate their positions, and the exchange is a further inclination of Japanese policy towards the Axis. Japan may not attack the Soviet Union immediately at present, at least in terms of posture it is approaching one step further. The world situation has become extremely clear at this point. The four major countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have only one way to unite and jointly resist the Axis. The Times News said that Germany's military attack on the Soviet Union has not been as smooth as expected, so it recognized the Nanjing organization in exchange for Japan's assistance. Japan has no way out except to attack the Soviet Union, so it will definitely accept Germany and Italy's demands. However, its troop deployment date must be after the return of Chongguang on the 20th of this month. The Saodang News said that what Germany and Italy have done is not only an accidental mistake, but a kind of unforgivable sin. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Striving for Democracy - Celebrating American Independence Day -</h3>
<p>Today is the 165th anniversary of the founding of the United States, which is also the day the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed during the Revolutionary War. A hundred and fifty years ago, it was a time when democratic ideas were flourishing. The concept that "all men are created equal," advocated by the philosophers Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Paine, had already deeply rooted itself in the hearts of people on both sides of the Atlantic. However, the transformation from thought to action, making democracy an unyielding political principle, was initiated by the American independence movement. The American writer L. Abbott said: "The French Revolution, the democratic reforms of the British Empire, and the unification of Italy were all products of the American Revolution." This is by no means an overstatement. Today, the strength and prosperity of the United States, and its role as a mainstay in the international political landscape, should be traced back to its traditional roots pursued in the independence movement.</p>
<p>At that time, the thirteen colonies in North America, under the leadership of Washington, launched a passionate and arduous revolutionary movement to demand independence. The reason for this is all known to be aroused by the issue of taxation. However, the reason why the people of the thirteen states unanimously expressed anger was not because of how harsh and irrational the taxes themselves were, but because the taxation violated all democratic principles. They felt that any burden placed upon them without their consent was an intolerable oppression and arbitrariness, and for this, it was worth fighting with blood and life.</p>
<p>Today, these past events have long become historical traces. The United Kingdom and the United States, two Anglo-Saxon nations that once met on the battlefield, ultimately belong to "blood is thicker than water." Moreover, beyond blood factors, there are inseparable interests in practical matters on both sides. This situation is particularly evident when one of the two countries encounters difficulties. However, the spirit of cherishing truth, justice, and valuing everything more than everything else, as demonstrated in the Revolutionary War, remains an important characteristic of the American people to this day. And the various crises experienced over the past 150 years, the most significant being the Civil War and World War I, have all achieved glorious achievements by relying on the basic spirit.</p>
<p>Now the United States is facing unprecedented threats and challenges in history. The aggressive atrocities suffered by the United States directly and indirectly in the past decade are almost impossible to compare with the tea tax and other issues that triggered the Revolutionary War. Therefore, the current moment is also a critical juncture for the American spirit of independence. We firmly believe that the American people's love for justice, truth, and freedom is indeed greater than in the past. This can be seen in their deep hatred for aggressive dictatorship, their enthusiastic actions for all international acts of justice, and especially their sympathy and support for China over the years, which all prove that they will never allow aggression and evil to run rampant while remaining detached. Looking at the aspirations of the US authorities: President Roosevelt's insight and ambition are not only unseen by previous US presidents in the past 20 years, but also show his outstanding talent more than the excessive idealism of the late Wilson. From his speech in Chicago in August 1937 to his recent fireside chat on May 27, it can be proven how his main consistent ideal is to put out the spread of aggressive atrocities. In the past six months, the atmosphere of the United States' participation in the war has matured unexpectedly, and even the recent speech by Navy Secretary Knox also advocated that the US Navy should take advantage of the German army's lack of time to look west and eliminate the harm to the country in the Atlantic. However, if the United States proceeds to participate in the war, it is not necessarily a cause for joy, but it is only compelled by circumstances. As for a few isolationists, they still stubbornly stick to their old ways, and nag incessantly, causing the necessary active measures to be invisibly constrained, thus allowing aggressive crimes to have the opportunity to prolong and expand, which is not only intolerable to justice and humanity, but also a sinner of the American traditional spirit.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Soviet war, the international division has already met the conditions that conform to the ideals of the world, but the cooperation between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist aggression has been slow to manifest itself so far. In this regard, the promotion task undertaken by the United States may be more urgent than direct participation in the war. In addition to celebrating American Independence Day, all justice-loving people around the world are keen to consider this further.</p>

<h3>Nearly a Thousand People Died in Chongqing Tunnel Tragedy; Including 146 Children; Hasty Tunnel Construction Caused This Strange Disaster</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The official report of the Chongqing Tunnel Suffocation Case Investigation Committee of June 5th was announced this afternoon. A total of 992 people died, 151 were seriously injured, and 919 corpses were buried by the public. There were 146 children who died. The report stated that the cause of the disaster was hasty construction and a lack of appropriate facilities, followed by poor management. The committee believed that the guards on duty were not at fault, but the air defense engineer and the highest air defense authorities could not shirk their responsibility. The report said that the suffocation was actually caused by the excessive number of people, because 6,555 people took refuge in the tunnel that night, while the usual capacity was only 4,384 people. The tragedy was caused by people in the tunnel rushing out to breathe fresh air, while people outside the tunnel rushed in due to hearing the second air raid alarm, causing them to be pushed down and trampled. The four government banks have donated 500,000 yuan to build ten new air-raid shelters in densely populated areas of the city. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Stalin's First Broadcast After the Outbreak of War Between Germany and the Soviet Union: Admits German Troops Have Invaded Soviet Territory, but Says They Will Inevitably Follow in Napoleon's Footsteps</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd—Soviet leader Stalin broadcasted yesterday, saying that although the enemy has been met with heroic resistance from the Red Army and its elite forces have been annihilated, they are still advancing and adding fresh troops to the front lines. Hitler's troops have now occupied most of Lithuania and Latvia, as well as parts of western Belarus and western Ukraine, but they will ultimately suffer defeat, just as Napoleon and Wilhelm II failed. The Soviet people must rise up to defend their sovereignty and territory, and make a united effort to deal with the enemy. All military personnel, both naval and army, and all civilians and soldiers must defend every inch of Soviet territory and fight for their cities and villages to the last drop of blood. Stalin said, "We must provide well-organized assistance to the Red Army in all aspects, using all our efforts to increase its numbers and ensure that the Red Army has obtained all necessary supplies. We must organize the transportation of troops, food, and ammunition, and provide large-scale assistance to the wounded. We must put everything else out of our minds for the benefit of the front lines and the work of defeating the enemy." He also urged intensified efforts to increase arms production and protect central power stations, telephone and telegraph communications, and local defense plans. He also mentioned the strategy of retreat, which the Russians have historically used effectively. It is said that when the Soviet army retreats, it will not leave behind a single railway locomotive or vehicle, an ounce of grain, or a gallon of gasoline for the German army. Farmers must take away all their livestock and hand over the slaughtered animals to state agencies for safekeeping and transportation to the rear. He continued, "In all areas occupied by the German army, all possible steps must be taken to render the German efforts ineffective. Therefore, guerrilla units and sabotage organizations must be established to resist the enemy's troops. The work of these guerrilla teams will be to destroy bridges, highways, enemy telephone and other communications, and set fire to fuel. It is essential to create a situation in the occupied areas that the enemy cannot bear." Germany, as a belligerent, had already mobilized before the war, deploying 170 divisions of troops to the border area, fully prepared, awaiting the signal to attack, while the Soviet army was still waiting to be mobilized and deployed to the border. Germany suddenly broke its promise, violating the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and disregarding world opinion. He added that the purpose of this war to resist fascist aggressors is not only to avoid the dangers that the Soviet Union will encounter, but also to help all the people of Europe who are groaning under the bondage of German fascism. The famous words of British Prime Minister Churchill in support of the Soviet Union and the declaration of the US government regarding preparations to aid the Soviet Union are significant in this regard. Finally, he said that the National Defense Committee has now been established, and all state power is concentrated in the hands of the committee, and it has already begun its work. He now calls on the people of the whole country to rally under the leadership of the Lenin Party and the Soviet government, so that they can assist the navy and army in annihilating the enemy and achieving victory.</p>
<h3>Partial Reorganization of the Finnish Cabinet</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 3rd—According to newspaper reports, the Finnish cabinet is about to be reorganized. The leader of the Social Democratic Party, Tanner, conducted Soviet-Finnish negotiations before the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War in December 1939. After Finland's defeat, Tanner resigned from his position as Foreign Minister under pressure from the Soviet Union. It is currently said that he will rejoin the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Military Service is the Top Priority for Resistance and Reconstruction: Chiang Orders Thorough Implementation; Sons of Gentry and Civil Servants Should Conscientiously Enlist</h3>
<p>Chongqing—The Military Affairs Commission recently launched a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army. On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram, ordering all localities to comply. The telegram is recorded below. It is noted that military service is the top priority for resistance and reconstruction. This important political matter must be taken the lead by the sons of gentry and civil servants, setting an example for the people, so as to establish a good atmosphere and promote smooth implementation. In March of the 27th year [1938], the Provisional National Congress of our Party resolved to strive to promote the military service system, stipulating that civil servants and party members should send their children and relatives to perform military service as an example. In July of the 28th year [1939], the Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] wrote to the gentry and educators across the country, urging civil servants and local gentry to personally send their children of conscription age to enlist in the army without waiting for the draw, and to send them to various military schools, so as to set an example. However, in recent years, there have been people who are the sons of gentry and civil servants who have enlisted, but there are also many who have taken advantage of their superior positions to avoid conscription. This is due to the failure to deeply establish the idea of service and to thoroughly implement it. Therefore, a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army has been launched, and the governors of each province are instructed to order the counties and cities to formulate detailed methods for thorough implementation, so as to achieve practical results within this year. In addition to separate telegrams, you are to comply with this order and report the handling situation as necessary. Chiang Kai-shek (telegram on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>Fu Bingchang Succeeds as Vice Foreign Minister; Xu Mo Appointed Minister to Australia</h3>
<p>Chongqing—After the order appointing Fu Bingchang as the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced, it was generally believed that the position of Chinese Minister to Australia would be most likely filled by the former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xu Mo.

<h3>Germany Claims to Advance on Three Fronts; Soviet Army Prepares Counterattack; Strong Soviet Resistance at Both Northern and Southern Ends; Major Battle Underway Southeast of Minsk</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 3rd—News received here yesterday indicates that the Soviet-German blitzkrieg on the Eastern Front continued yesterday, on an unprecedented scale. Neither side has achieved a decisive victory so far. The Germans claim to be making broad advances towards Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv, while a Moscow spokesperson claimed that Soviet forces would annihilate the vanguard of German armored divisions and said that the Soviet army could "guarantee that Hitler will never win."</p>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd—German troops advanced on three fronts yesterday: the central front towards Moscow, the southern front towards Kyiv, the heart of Ukraine, and the northern front through the Baltic states towards Leningrad. The High Command stated that the German southern flank is advancing, splitting into two routes south of the Pripet Marshes. The first route follows the highway via Raków towards Kyiv and the center of Ukraine. It is reported that the vanguard has passed the old Soviet-Polish border on the Kyiv highway. The second route saw German troops engage in a tank battle with Soviet forces near Szczerzec, 50 miles east of Lviv, after occupying Lviv.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd—According to yesterday evening's communiqué, the German armored columns' attempt to make a major breakthrough towards Moscow encountered fierce Soviet resistance at Borisov, 50 miles east of Minsk. This is because it is the same route Napoleon took when he led a large army to attack Moscow. The Germans appear to be attempting their largest breakthrough operation in the Belarusian triangle region east of Minsk. The apex of this triangle is Borisov, the southwestern point is Rusk, 55 miles from Minsk, and the southeastern point is Bobruisk, 85 miles southeast of Minsk.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd—Although German troops have advanced hundreds of miles since the outbreak of hostilities on the Eastern Front, their progress has now slowed considerably due to strong Soviet resistance and fierce Soviet air support, and in some places has even been completely blocked. London military sources indicated today that the German advance appears to have begun to slow down. The main areas of operation are currently southeast of Minsk, where the Soviet army is engaged in a major battle to prevent the German advance to the east. The main German forces are attempting to break through towards Moscow in this area. A recent Soviet communiqué stated that German troops had been blocked in the area around Minsk and Lierk, while the Germans claimed to have crossed the Prut River. The Soviet communiqué mainly concerned the fighting in the Lierk area south of the Pripet Marshes, from which the Germans are now fiercely attacking Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. According to Moscow, Soviet forces have blocked the German mechanized units' advance at Shepetovka, on the direct route to Kyiv. The Germans then attempted to break through south towards Tarnopol. According to the Soviet announcement, this offensive was stopped after fierce fighting throughout the night. Reports from all sides indicate that the Soviet troops in this area are currently putting up very strong resistance. On the Bessarabian border, the German communiqué claimed today that Romanian troops had crossed the Prut River in northern Moldova yesterday and are now advancing. A major battle is currently taking place in the triangular area formed by the three cities of Borisov, Bobruisk, and Rusk in Belarus.</p>

<p>TASS, Moscow, 3rd—Last night, fierce fighting continued in the Murmansk, Dvinsk, Minsk, and Rusk areas. In the Murmansk area, the enemy began to attack the Sredny Peninsula.

In the Dvinsk and Minsk areas, our troops took drastic action on the night of July 2nd, destroying the enemy's vanguard tank units. At night, our troops fought motorized and mechanized units in the Rusk area, inflicting heavy casualties. On July 1st, the weather was very bad, and flying was extremely difficult, but our air force still successfully bombed enemy tank units in the Tvirk and Minsk areas, destroying many enemy planes and tanks, while also causing difficulties in the enemy's supply of military equipment and preventing the advance of the enemy's motorized infantry. It was previously reported that 56 enemy planes were shot down on June 30th, but according to accurate statistics, 102 enemy planes were shot down. In addition, our air force bombed enemy airfields, and 50 enemy planes were unable to escape.

<p>Summary of the Situation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd—The German and Soviet military headquarters' recent communiqués have both claimed major victories. Neutral sources in Stockholm reported this morning that German troops are now only 325 miles from Moscow, while the Soviets are currently concentrating a large army to launch a counterattack in an effort to defeat the enemy. The Stockholm report also stated that the German troops advancing towards the Soviet capital are the vanguard that broke into Minsk, and this route of German troops has left the main road from Minsk via Smolensk to Moscow. Their purpose is clearly to implement an encirclement operation, as was done east of Bialystok. The Soviets are concentrating a large army in Smolensk (250 miles east of Minsk and west of Moscow) to prepare for a counterattack. At the same time, several divisions of fresh Soviet troops are heading west towards Moscow in an endless stream. The situation on the Soviet front is summarized as follows: from northern to southern Finland, the Soviets say that Soviet troops are still resisting strongly in the Murmansk area, but the situation in the port of Murmansk is unknown. Finnish sources say that the railway line from Leningrad to Murmansk has been cut off. There is no news of fighting in southern Finland.</p>
<p>Baltic States: The Germans say that they have occupied the Latvian capital of Riga and the Ventra area west of Riga along the Baltic Sea. The chances of Soviet troops breaking out are now very small, and the Soviet troops retreating into Estonia are also being bombed by German aircraft. Swedish reports say that German paratroopers have landed near Taidu (formerly Dorpat) in Estonia. Although the Soviet troops in the Murmansk area appear to be succeeding in their operations, and the Germans near Kaunas, Lithuania, have been contained, it is heard from London that the Soviet troops in these two Baltic coastal states are currently facing major difficulties.</p>
<p>Minsk Area: The Germans say that most of the two Soviet forces isolated east of Bialystok have been destroyed. In addition, since the Soviet report previously said that Soviet forces had destroyed the vanguard tanks of the enemy, no official news has been received from that area. The neutral report that the German tank columns are now 325 miles from Moscow means that the German troops have only advanced 35 miles after reaching the Berezina River.</p>
<p>Lviv Area: Moscow reports say that the German troops departing from Lviv have been stopped by Soviet troops. This news may confirm the German report of fighting 50 miles east and about 35 miles southeast of Lviv. The Germans admitted that Soviet armored vehicles launched fierce counterattacks but claimed to have repelled them. London believes that there are still Soviet troops fighting more than 100 miles behind the German vanguard. News from Budapest today said that the Hungarian army is taking the offensive, and its purpose may be to break the resistance of this part of the Soviet army. The Hungarian General Staff has announced, "There are no more Soviet troops on the Hungarian border because the enemy has retreated to new positions after being attacked."</p>
<p>Romanian Border: There is no news from the Romanian side, except for the Soviet naval newspaper "Red Fleet" reporting that Soviet warships shelled and destroyed the naval base of Constanța yesterday.</p>
<p>End of the Great Encirclement Battle in Poland; Germany Claims to Have Captured 160,000 Soviet Troops</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 3rd—The German High Command announced that in the battle east of Bialystok (northeast of Warsaw, Poland), from June 22nd to July 3rd, German troops captured 5,770 tanks, 2,330 artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns, countless armored vehicles, machine guns, and rifles. At the same time, the Soviet Union lost 4,725 aircraft, of which 1,392 were shot down in air combat, 112 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 3,221 were destroyed at airfields. Currently, 160,000 Soviet troops have been captured. Soviet troops repeatedly attempted to break out, and the number of dead and wounded was several times the number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 3rd—Today's German war report stated that German and Romanian forces are advancing side by side from northern Moldova and have crossed the Prut River. The entire Soviet front from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean is encountering the Allied forces' advance. The Soviet military authorities' attempt to prevent the Allied forces from entering has apparently failed. The Soviet army is already in retreat. The decisive battle east of Bialystok, which is of great importance in world history, is about to end. Countless Soviet cavalry and tank units in the north have been annihilated. The German air force is cooperating very effectively with the army.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd—A responsible person released a supplementary statement to the German war report, stating that the Soviet war report has admitted to the retreat in Galicia and the loss of Lviv. In the Rusk area, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack with armored divisions but has been annihilated. The German army has occupied the southern part of the Pripet Marshes. The Soviet army in the north is being encircled and annihilated. The German army on the northern front has crossed the Daugava River between Daugavpils and Riga. The Soviet army south of the Gulf of Riga and west of Riga has been surrounded. Because the port of Ventspils has fallen into German hands, the surrounded Soviet army has no hope of escaping by ship. German aircraft have controlled the skies from the front lines to the enemy's rear. Most of the land that the Soviet Union gained from Poland and the Baltic states from 1939 to 1940 has been occupied by the German army. Currently, the German army is attacking the Soviet mainland.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd—It was announced here that the German High Command yesterday dispatched additional fresh troops to participate in the war. The German offensive is "proceeding smoothly along a 2,000-mile winding front." The German headquarters also stated that another major encirclement battle since Dunkirk has now been resolved with the surrender of 160,000 Soviet troops in the pocket.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd—The German army has captured the Osowiec Fortress in the Biebrza River marsh area. This is the third time the German army has occupied it in 30 years. After fierce fighting, the German army captured more than 2,000 Soviet troops, seized 14 tanks, 34 artillery pieces, about 100 machine guns, and 20 aircraft. More than 1,000 Soviet soldiers' bodies were left on the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Britain Announces for the First Time that the American Volunteer Air Force "Eagle Squadron" is Participating in the War: Three German Planes Shot Down in Northern France; No Air Raids in British Territory During the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Associated Press, London, 3rd—Britain announced that the American Volunteer Air Force "Eagle Squadron" in the Royal Air Force participated in the attack on northern France yesterday. This is the first time that the Eagle Squadron's participation in aerial combat has been officially mentioned.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd—The Air Ministry communiqué stated that the British Air Force attacked northern France again yesterday afternoon, destroying 18 enemy fighters, of which 16 were shot down by British fighters (3 by the American Eagle Squadron) and 2 were shot down by British bombers. The British Air Force lost 2 bombers and 8 fighters. British Blenheim bombers, protected by a large squadron of fighters, attacked the Merville airfield near Lille, and bombs fell on the runway, buildings, and among enemy aircraft parked on the airfield. The railway junction southeast of Lille was also bombed. Although the ground defenses and a large squadron of enemy fighters put up strong resistance, they ultimately failed to prevent the British aircraft's fierce attack.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd—The Air Ministry announced that there were still no air raids in British airspace during the day yesterday. As of 6:00 PM, no reports of bombs falling in any part of Britain had been received.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd—Last night, British aircraft continued to bomb German ports, communication lines, and heavy industries. Bremen, Duisburg, and Düsseldorf were the main targets. According to the Air Ministry communiqué released this morning, large fires broke out in the industrial areas of the above three cities, and Bremen was bombed even more severely. Oil depots in Hamburg and Rotterdam were also attacked. Although enemy fighters and anti-aircraft guns put up resistance, they were overcome. One enemy fighter was hit by a British heavy bomber over the Netherlands and crashed to the ground. Also, an enemy supply ship near the French coast in the English Channel was attacked by a British Coastal Command aircraft. Four British bombers went missing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Requisitions Cargo Ships Bound for the United States</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Manila, 3rd—The Japanese government's action of requisitioning Japanese ships carrying military raw materials from the Philippines to the United States has sparked various speculations here about Japan's motives. The Manila shipping industry has been notified that the Japanese ship Kyusyn Maru, which was en route from Manila to the United States, was stopped in Kobe yesterday and ordered to unload cargo such as sugar, coconut oil, abaca, and chromium produced in the Philippines. The Nizima Maru, which is currently here, has also been ordered by the Japanese government to unload 6,000 tons of chromium bound for the United States. The cargo was loaded last week. After unloading, the Japanese ship was ordered to return to Japan. The Bordeos Maru, loaded with 3,600 tons of chromium, was also stopped in Kobe and ordered to unload its cargo. Japan's actions have made the Philippine shipping industry feel uneasy because, since the United States canceled many voyages to the Pacific Ocean, they have largely relied on Japanese shipping to transport goods across the Pacific. Business circles believe that Japan's actions are a reprisal for the United States expanding export controls to the Philippines, which has cut off the supply of abaca, coconut oil, manganese, chromium, copper, and other goods needed by Japan. Japan's actions will prevent the US government from using Japanese ships to transport military raw materials to the United States.</p>
<h3>British Troops in Syria Recapture Palmyra</h3>
<p>United Press International, Cairo, 3rd – A British General Headquarters communiqué stated that British forces have recaptured the Syrian palm grove (Palmyra), which controls the eastern half of Syria. It was previously surrounded and counterattacked by French forces, leading to a temporary loss. Heavy fighting also occurred near Nebek, near Damascus, where British and Free French forces repelled an attack by Vichy forces, destroying several tanks and capturing one.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 2nd – An official communiqué released tonight stated that in the past twenty-four hours, British forces have concentrated their strength and launched several attacks on Palmyra in northern Syria. A mechanized unit of the enemy also advanced from Iraq along the Euphrates River, making contact with our forces at Tel Aazer. In southern Lebanon, our patrols repelled enemy sentries at Jezzine.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (6)(6): Paratrooper Training and Tactics</h3>
<p>Between fields, ditches crisscross. On straight roads, wooden stakes and other obstacles are everywhere, creating countless narrow alleys. Soldiers are scattered like stars, everywhere. This is a snapshot of today's Britain.</p>
<p>This scarred countryside has come about as a result of the German "vertical envelopment" strategy. "Vertical envelopment" is a new type of offensive tactic from the sky. This tactic is not bombing, but rather the landing of troops from the air to attack the enemy. The defending forces must dig trenches and set up obstacles to prevent aircraft from landing.</p>
<p>Of course, paratroopers and airborne troops alone are too weak to conquer a well-prepared country. But if used as part of an invading force, the invasion has a much better chance of success. When the Soviet Union first tested the dropping of soldiers and equipment from airplanes, most of us thought of parachute demonstrations at rural markets. The plane flew very high, and in broad daylight, with everyone watching, the parachutist jumped, and the parachute did not open. Just as the audience held their breath in complete silence, he pulled the rope, and the parachute suddenly opened, his body floating gently to the ground. Watching the paratrooper descend slowly from the sky, how easy it would be to hit such a target!</p>
<p>But in war, the landing technique of paratroopers is very different.</p>
<p>A few lookouts are on duty, and mobile units are stationed at key locations, ready to move at a moment's notice. It is a starry night, and all is silent. The watchmen are vigilant, afraid to close their eyes. At first, they hear nothing, but suddenly they hear a soft but firm command: "Surrender!" Taken by surprise, they are surrounded by the enemy, who have already launched their offensive, and they cannot resist.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>The planes carrying these paratroopers fly high in the sky, stopping their engines far from the destination and gliding silently in the dark. At the selected location, plainclothes agents signal, and the planes suddenly begin dropping paratroopers from a height of less than one hundred yards. The soldiers jump out of the plane one by one, open their parachutes, and float to the ground. At the same time, other parachutes drop weapons, ammunition, and various equipment.</p>
<p>In just a few seconds, catching the guards off guard, or even before they see them, the paratroopers have reached the ground, assembled their weapons, and formed a small combat team with offensive capabilities. They are fully armed, with pistols, rifles, light machine guns, and even light mortars. Guided by the plainclothes agents, this small but powerful combat team begins to move.</p>
<p>This is indeed a "mission of sacrifice," its purpose being to disrupt enemy transportation and various facilities. But these paratroopers are the vanguard of the airborne troops. Because airborne troops must land in transport planes, which is no different from ordinary troop transport, they can carry heavy weapons, but they must have an airfield prepared for landing. The purpose of these paratroopers is to occupy, clear, and secure the airfield.</p>
<p>This is not purely theoretical; it is a general picture of what is really happening in today's war. Take the example of the Dutch troops guarding the Maas River bridge. They were ordered to defend the bridge and, if necessary, destroy it to prevent the German advance. But before they could react, the bridge was seized by paratroopers, and the vanguard of the German armored division was able to cross the Maas River and advance rapidly. In Rotterdam, German paratroopers landed and occupied the weakly guarded Waalhaven airfield. Airborne troops then landed at the airfield, and seaplanes landed in the nearby waterways at the same time.</p>
<p>During the German invasion of Norway, paratroopers also helped to hinder the Allied advance on several occasions. Planes also carried large numbers of German troops across the Skagerrak Strait. It is said that the Germans used a secret weapon when occupying the Eben Emael fortress in Belgium. Whether this secret weapon existed is debatable, but it can be asserted that German paratroopers were a new factor in the capture of the fortress. Paratroopers also played an important role in the German attacks on Greece and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>But airborne invasion is not easy. When the Germans attempted to land airborne troops in Belgium at Chièvres, they unexpectedly found the ground full of motorcycles. Because they could not land, the operation failed. From this lesson, the Germans learned that paratroopers must land first from airborne troops to clear the airfield. According to one story, German paratroopers in Narvik, Norway, were killed or injured because they landed too low and fell on the rugged rocks.</p>
<p>There are conflicting reports about the success of the British paratroopers who landed in Italy, but it is clear that the entire force was wiped out, either killed, wounded, or captured. This was expected and is inherent in the nature of the work. Paratroopers on a mission of sacrifice must be willing to sacrifice themselves to complete the task of destroying some important transportation link.</p>
<p>Not just anyone can be a paratrooper. Because the work is too dangerous, only daredevils are allowed to volunteer. And because paratroopers often have to fight on the ground under extremely unfavorable conditions, only elite soldiers who have received complete training in other areas are allowed to volunteer. Therefore, paratroopers must be strong and agile, and not too old, at most in their thirties. Also, because most paratroopers attack locations and targets that they have never seen before, they must be able to read military maps without error and understand the meaning of every shadow in aerial photographs.</p>
<p>When these carefully selected men begin paratrooper training, they must be deeply surprised, wondering if they are in the military or in a circus. Rope walking and somersaulting techniques are emphasized because paratroopers must be familiar with how to land without injury. They initially make several test jumps from a platform five or six feet high. Although it looks easy, they will be violently shaken if they don't know how to land.</p>
<p>Special instructors explain how to relax the whole body when landing and bend the knees slightly to avoid injury. Once they have mastered this technique, they can jump from higher up. If equipment allows, they can practice descending in a controlled parachute seat, so the new recruits can get used to this kind of jolt. Only then can they drop freely without ropes. But the Germans prefer to make their initial jumps from airplanes. They believe that descending from a tower does not closely resemble real conditions and is therefore of little value. During training, they can learn how to exit the plane from simulated or real planes on the ground.</p>
<p>Each trainee is also guided by experts to study the parachute and how to fold it. A poorly folded parachute may not open. If he knows that his parachute was folded by an expert, and that expert is himself, it will increase his confidence. American paratroopers carry a reserve parachute in addition to their regular parachute.</p>
<p>Paratroopers must also learn how to fight on the ground with the parachute. A parachute that is twenty-eight feet wide and full of wind is not easy to control. It can drag a strong man off the ground like a runaway horse, pulling him along. Only by knowing how to control the ropes and "leak" the wind can this be avoided.</p>
<p>The day of the first jump is a memorable day for a paratrooper. Whether he is accepted or not, he has an unspeakable feeling in his heart. This is not nervousness, but rather too much hope. The first jump requires special courage. Even those who are known for their bravery may be afraid to jump. There have been cases where a plane was damaged and forced to descend, and others jumped out and landed safely, but a soldier refused to obey the pilot's orders, preferring to perish with the plane. There is also a story that a certain American paratrooper battalion had completed all its training, but when it came time for the first jump, the soldiers stood at the door of the plane, frozen like chickens, afraid to jump.</p>
<p>The parachutist knows that all safety measures have been implemented, and the pilot has chosen a position to drop a dummy to test the wind direction. He hears the commands to prepare and jump, and he attaches the rope that opens the parachute to a metal line on the plane. When the final command is given, he jumps down. But this novice cannot yet be called a paratrooper. This is just the first jump. He must practice many times before he can earn the honorary title of paratrooper.</p>
<p>Today's leading powers have established paratrooper teams and airborne infantry. The United States has already formed the 501st Parachute Battalion, indicating that the experimental stage is over and the development stage has begun. The War Department has ordered the formation of three more paratrooper battalions, and several airborne infantry units are in training.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that Germany has built 28,000 gliders, each capable of carrying fourteen fully equipped soldiers. One transport plane or bomber can tow two gliders. So, in theory, Germany has the ability to transport 400,000 airborne troops and paratroopers. (The End)</p>

<h3>British Mission to the Soviet Union Holds Important Talks; British Embassy Hosts Grand Reception; British Parliamentarian Proposes Cooperation Between British and Soviet Air Forces</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd – The British mission continued practical talks with Soviet representatives yesterday, and progress was reportedly made. Last night, the British Embassy held the first social gathering since the mission's arrival, hosted by British Ambassador Cripps. In addition to Soviet Vice Foreign Secretary Vyshinsky, Sobolov, and Soviet representatives from the army, navy, and air force, many diplomats, such as the ambassadors from the United States, Turkey, China, and Iran, as well as the Swedish minister, attended. The Soviet Union has now formed a five-member National Defense Committee. Many factories are holding meetings, calling for the establishment of a war cabinet like the British one.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 2nd – After the Soviet government requested that the United States sell various raw materials to the country, political figures here recently commented that the Soviet government hopes that the German-Soviet war will last for a long time, becoming a protracted war of attrition. This can be seen from this request. General MacFarlane, chief representative of the British military delegation, has gone to the headquarters of the Red Army on the Western Front after meeting with Soviet authorities to examine the actual situation. This is further proof that Britain is providing technical assistance to the Soviet Union in its fight against Germany. However, it is not yet known what kind of assistance the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, requested from the United States when he visited Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday. It can be asserted that the United States may supply the Soviet Union with machine tools to increase the output of its arms industry. Aviation gasoline is also an important item that the United States may supply to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – During a House of Commons session, a member asked whether the British side would prepare to share the operational experience of the British Air Force and the production experience of the British aircraft industry with the Soviet Union for reference. Minister of Aircraft Production Brabazon replied, "Yes. Detailed preparations have not yet been made, but the British side will provide the Soviet Union with all kinds of assistance." A member requested that some British workers be sent to the Soviet Union. He did not answer this question.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Satisfaction with Actions of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd – A spokesman for the Soviet government stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the Soviet government expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the declarations made by US President Roosevelt, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Undersecretary of State Welles regarding resistance to German domination. Soviet newspapers excerpted sympathetic words about the Soviet Union from British newspapers. One newspaper stated, "Soviet workers now feel that they are not alone. The attacks by Finland and other countries against the Soviet Union are merely an extension of German aggression, 'not an attack on the Soviet Union by Germany.'" Strict fire and poison gas prevention measures are now being carried out in Moscow. On the streets, the public can be seen lined up, waiting for newspapers or listening to radio broadcasts, apart from the men, women, and children who have evacuated to rural areas.</p>
<h3>British Public Holds Mass Meeting, Expresses Sympathy for Soviet Union</h3>
<p>TASS, London, 3rd – Mass meetings were held in several British cities, resolving to share common interests with the Soviet Union. 1,500 people were present in London. Resolutions were passed, willing to be the backing of the British government to assist the Soviet Union to resist fascist Germany. Several participants in the conferences expressed to the Soviet ambassador in London, that they are in sympathy with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>American Sympathy for the Soviet Union Increases Daily</h3>
<p>TASS, New York, 3rd – American sympathy for the Soviet Union is increasing daily. Most American newspapers support the American declaration issued by Roosevelt, to assist the Soviet Union within possible boundaries. The Soviet consulate receives daily a large batch of letters from labor unions, public organizations, and individuals. Several senators also advocate assisting the Soviet Union as much as possible. Senator Smith said, "We must supply the Soviet Union with all necessities." Several public organizations and labor unions have issued declarations, stating that they will do their best to help the Soviet people resist. These organizations include the American-Soviet Union Association, the American Student Union, and others. Well-known American cultural figures also enthusiastically advocate supporting the Soviet Union. Secondly, an American radio station raised the question, "Should America help the Soviet Union?" 80 percent of the listeners said that they should assist. This can represent the majority of the American public’s opinion, and even more prove the depth of the American public's sympathy for the Soviet Union. The Soviet people have actually obtained the assistance of all mankind, especially the majority of the American public.</p>
<h3>Mexican Parliamentarians Sympathize With Soviet Union, Advocate Confiscation of German and Italian Property</h3>
<p>TASS, New York, 3rd – According to Mexican newspapers, the Mexican Parliament is discussing the Soviet-German war. Most parliamentarians believe that the Soviet Union will win. "Senator Chivalier said that he sympathizes with the Soviet Union and advocates closing the consulates in Mexico. To prevent fascist propaganda in the Americas, German and Italian property in Mexico should be confiscated." Senator Gullias said, "The Soviet-German war is actually the beginning of Germany's demise, because the Soviet Union has an excellent air force and mechanized units."</p>
<h3>Soviet Nationals in Japan Will Soon Evacuate</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd – The Soviet Embassy announced this afternoon that Soviet women and children would be evacuated home. The first group of one hundred women and children, including the families of Soviet Embassy personnel, will depart on July 5, taking the Siberian Railway. The Soviet side has considered various methods to guarantee the safety of the evacuees along the way. Due to the railway being too crowded, they will be divided into two groups.</p>
<h3>Japan Divided on Policy Toward Germany and Soviet Union; One Faction Advocates Cautious Action, One Faction Advocates Preparing for Britain and United States</h3>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 3rd – This morning, editorials in local newspapers about Japan's attitude toward the German-Soviet war revealed two trends. One trend opposes alliance policies, firmly insisting that Japan must be independent and self-determined, and not be bound by any country. The other trend advocates adopting a policy of non-interference, so that Japan can focus all its efforts on the situation in the Pacific to prevent Britain and the United States from intensifying their encirclement of Japan. The Asahi Shimbun represents the former opinion, stating, "Japan should not be moved by considerations of glory and interest. Prime Minister Konoe recently said, 'Japan should not take advantage of others' misfortunes and act rashly.' This statement is perfectly reasonable. Japan must pursue an independent policy, relying only on its own strength." The Hochi Shimbun's tone is even more blunt, stating, "Japan can no longer trust the various countries in Europe. Japanese-German cooperation has become a thing of the past. Japan has now recognized its own position and must act independently, without assistance." The Yomiuri Shimbun represents the latter opinion, stating, "Japan should shift its gaze from the north to the south, because Britain and the United States will take advantage of the current situation to strengthen their anti-Japanese policies. The United States is currently sending planes and pilots to Chongqing, prohibiting merchant ships of third countries from passing through the Panama Canal, and intensifying its hostile encirclement of Japan in the area from Singapore to Midway Island, and increasing defensive construction on Midway and Trinidad islands. All of this should be noted. Therefore, we should not focus solely on the German-Soviet war, but should expose the enemy's attempt to use the German-Soviet war to attack Japan's conspiracy."</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd – Political circles declared today that Japan's statement, respecting both the Tripartite Pact and the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, seems sufficient to reveal that the elements within Japan who advocate an independent policy and do not openly support Axis operations have at least temporarily gained the upper hand. This means that, outwardly, Japan has decided in the near future to refrain from directly assisting Germany, such as attacking Siberia or using its navy to invade and seize the interests of Britain and the Netherlands. On the contrary, Japan's policy seems to be to indirectly assist the Axis, while focusing on establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that Japan can be self-reliant and have independent strength. Political experts rarely interpret this move as favorable to the United States, because in any case, the US fleet will be forced to remain in the Pacific, and Japan may change its policy at any time.</p>
<h3>British Interests in China Impaired; Question Raised in House of Commons; Answer Given by Foreign Secretary Eden</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – What was mostly discussed in the House of Commons last night were incidents in China. Members raised various questions to Foreign Secretary Eden, such as the activities of anti-British groups in North China, the Japanese restrictions on shipping between ports in Shanghai and Zhejiang, and the circulation of legal tender in the occupied areas of China. Conservative Party member Hannah first asked whether the Foreign Secretary had received a report regarding the chairman of the Anti-British Federation, who stated that anyone who openly ships goods would not be forgiven, and what actions the Foreign Office had taken regarding this matter. Eden replied that, according to reports received, there was no evidence that the sales of British goods in Peiping had been affected by the activities of the Anti-British Federation. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware that shipping in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places was generally prohibited by the Japanese authorities on the pretext of military necessity, except for Japanese ships, thus hindering British shipping companies, and whether he had taken steps to stop this exclusive action that discriminated against British trade. Eden replied that the Japanese naval authorities, in their announcements on July 15 and August 10 last year, prohibited ships of any nationality from entering designated areas of the Chinese coast, including the ports of Zhejiang Province. Since then, no British ships have sailed to the ports of Zhejiang Province, but British rights have been formally reserved. The British side has negotiated with the Japanese authorities regarding interference in British shipping. Milner then asked whether the Foreign Secretary could not make more forceful negotiations, given that the necessity of the so-called military reservations by the Japanese had changed with the passage of time. Eden replied that he agreed with Milner's assumption about the situation. This is all within the general position of negotiations with Japan. The Japanese people accused us of the economic restrictions we imposed on the Japanese people, but this is the only answer, and we cannot help until the situation improves.</p>
<h3>Governor of Oregon Urges US Aid to China; US Should Fully Protect Lines of Communication</h3>
<p>United Press International, Boston, 3rd – The Governor of Oregon, Sprague, said yesterday at the Governors' Conference, "If Japan launches a war against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, then action by the US Navy 'is evidently required'." He also said that the United States must "fully protect all US lines of communication in the Far East, because any victory by Japan in South Asia would be sufficient to cut off major raw materials and supplies." Sprague opposed Philippine independence, because their military and commercial position are very important, and argued that adequate protection should be given to the islands, "so that our position obtains a reasonable security from Japan." He also stated that if the United States could continue to supply China with adequate goods, it might maintain the balance of power in the East without armed intervention.</p>
<h3>Knox's Statement: America Not Escorting</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd – President Roosevelt's hope that America could remain outside the war has become the focus of attention at Secretary of the Navy Knox's press conference today. Knox recently strongly advocated for American action. Today, Knox explicitly stated to reporters that American ships patrolling the Atlantic are not being used to escort ships, nor are they engaged in any war activities. There have been no crew casualties or equipment losses. When reporters questioned him about Congress's criticism of his call for America to eliminate Nazi threats in the Atlantic, Knox declined to comment further, only acknowledging that he stands by what he has already said. More responsible newspaper critics have offered quite blunt opinions. The New York Times's Washington correspondent, Mr. Krock, stated that, on the surface, one of Roosevelt's cabinet members is now openly advocating a policy contrary to that of the President. The President hopes for peace, while this cabinet member calls for war. This can be seen as insubordination. However, Knox is trusted by President Roosevelt and participates in confidential discussions. His continued assertion that the President's hesitation endangers national security suggests that the President himself may not disagree with Knox's views, hoping that the ensuing discussions will garner support from a divided nation for future major decisions. In other words, this is a staged performance to prepare the public. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the President has not wavered from his promise to continue aiding Britain. The Baltimore Sun demands that the nation be shown the facts, stating that cabinet members should speak either less than Knox or more than Knox. It also stated that America's openly implemented policy of recognizing Britain not only as a friendly nation but also as a comrade should be vigorously pursued and not revert to isolation. The majority of the nation has already decided to provide Britain with complete and effective aid. After increasing production, war materials should be delivered to Britain. If they are not delivered immediately, the reasons why and the necessary remedies should be explained to the nation. The American people, for their own protection, should know what they need to know and be provided leadership in whatever steps are necessary for their own protection. The Washington Post hopes that Knox's comments will be a precursor to American action, stating that if Hitler establishes himself in Europe, America will soon be fragmented on land, and America's voice in the world will become a faint whisper. It is not yet too late to thwart Hitler's plan to create a great empire to threaten the world. Britain and America should strike while Hitler is fighting the Soviet Union, so that both Europe and America can be freed from their shackles.</p>

<h3>Securities: Same Chinese Bonds, Domestic and Foreign Diverge. Foreign Debts Soar, Domestic Debts Plunge. Joy or Fear? Which is Right and Which is Wrong?</h3>
<p>London, 2nd (Wednesday) – Today's Chinese foreign debts and Far East British company share listings saw a boost. Previous Chinese foreign debts all rose. Sino-French US dollars (with stamps) rose £7 to £45, Rehabilitation (British issued) rose £5 to £36, Anglo-French (British issued) and Chrisp rose £4 each, the former to £42 and the latter to £27. Anglo-German Continuation (British issued) rose £2 to £42. Subsequent railway bonds only saw Hukuang German issue fall £1 to £12. British stocks: Ma Jia Li Bank rose 3 shillings and 9 pence to £8 16 shillings and 3 pence, HSBC Bank UK registered shares rose half a pound to £76, and Kailan Mining unregistered shares rose 6 pence to 12 shillings and 6 pence. No other changes. In the midst of turbulent times, the repeated rise of Chinese foreign debt shows Britain's optimistic view of China's future.</p>
<p>After a two-day holiday, the gray market for public bonds resumed trading yesterday. Due to changes in the environment, the market situation suddenly caused weak-willed bulls to emerge, and a sharp decline began. Because bulls usually concentrate on types C and E, the drop in these two types was also the greatest. Rumors are rampant, and the truth cannot be determined. However, observing the rise of foreign debts in London shows that there is no reason for the decline of domestic debts, and that they are short-sighted, taking a corner accident as a shift, and not thinking of the clear distinction, which is a good omen for a glorious future. The bond market has been hit. In the afternoon, there was a rumor of the court taking over, and type C suddenly broke the two-yuan mark. For a time, many parties emerged, and with the pressure of short sellers, the market situation declined in a straight line with no turning point. The future is temporarily difficult to recover. Only when the market stabilizes can there be hope of a turnaround. However, it still needs to change with the situation. In the morning, the opening price was still good due to the purchase of Tongkang and Xiexing. However, as Hongda bulls emerged, and Xinfu also sold off, the market situation declined in a straight line. Because Yitai and Xinhua had a large appetite, although Tongxing and Xiekang still sold, type C failed to break the two-yuan mark. In the afternoon, rumors became more prevalent. Yitai and Yongchang still had a strong appetite, and Lianyi and Runde also bought in, but Renfeng, Renchang, Xieda, Hongda, and Lianhe all sold off. The market opened and broke below the two-yuan mark. As a result of oversupply, the decline became more severe. Type A broke 80 yuan, and type E broke 70 yuan. The market situation was irreversible. As a result, all fell by 65 cents to 1 yuan and 45 cents. The total number of transactions was about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 91 yuan and 75 cents.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Chamber of Commerce is still active. Rubber stock trading has increased sharply. The quoted price was heard to be lower than the previous closing price, and then partially recovered to a high level, but the result was still softening. The buying of rubber stocks is very strong, and the prices of several types have been raised significantly.</p>
<h3>Finance: Sudden Tightness in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed exchange rates remained flat, but the gray market for British and American exchange rates suddenly became tight, and gold prices soared again. After the morning opening, the Bank of England and HSBC suddenly came to absorb, and Chinese speculators also turned to force purchases. As a result, around 11:00, the US dollar softened to 5.3125 yuan, and the British gold also tightened to 3 pence 25. After the supply of Chinese banks, the tightening stopped slightly at noon. In the afternoon, foreign banks still lacked the intention to supply, while Chinese banks suddenly slightly absorbed. Speculative buying reignited, causing the recent British gold to soften to 5.25 yuan and the British gold to reach 3 pence 25. When it was heard that Japanese warships were concentrated in the Lushun area, the US dollar rebounded slightly. August 5.3125 yuan can be settled, and the recent British exchange rate is still tightly squeezed. The entire day's trading was very active.</p>
<p>HSBC Absorption Starts Tightness</p>

The US to British exchange rate rose 25, the US to Shanghai exchange rate rose a small 3 points, the US to Japanese exchange rate rose 14 cents, and the British market exchange rates were all flat. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices. Spot prices are flat. The British exchange rate is 3 pence 296875, and the US dollar is 5.40625. After the opening, speculative buyers and sellers were mixed under the rumor of many benefits. Because HSBC absorbed Chinese banks' July US dollars at 5.375 yuan, a tightening trend began. HSBC's listed exchange rates have not changed. The small counter's US exchange rate has been reduced by 0625, for a total of 5.3125 yuan. The silver balance tax is still slightly 23.75 percent. Speculators are forcing to buy July and August 5.375 yuan, and Chinese banks are also constantly spitting out, and the situation has stabilized for a while. Until around 10:00, speculators also turned to buy July and August 5.34375 yuan, so it continued to soften to 5.3125 yuan, and British gold softened to 3 pence 25. Fortunately, Chinese banks maintained a continuous supply, and the tightening stopped slightly. At noon, British gold closed at 3 pence 265625, and the US dollar closed at 5.34375 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Commercial Banks Emerge and Re-enter</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Chinese speculators still operated both buying and selling. Chinese banks transferred speculative July 5.34375 yuan and 3125 yuan to speculators. Foreign banks' intentions to supply were dim, but they had a stomach for it. The market trend was gradually tightening. Chinese merchants came to re-enter August 5.3125 yuan, the tightest recent and distant months were settled at 5.28125 yuan (one said the recent 5.25 yuan), and the market situation was mixed. At the 3:30 closing, spot to August were all British exchange rates of 3 pence 25, compared with the closing before the holiday (30th), all tightened by 046875. US exchange rates spot to July were 5 yuan 28125, squeezing tight by 125, and August was 5.3125 yuan, tightening by 09375.</p>

<h3>Post-Holiday Gold Market Sees Sudden and Intense Surge, Peak Reaching 6,570 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market, operating in the unofficial "fried red" market, resumed business as usual. Breaking a two-month period of stagnation, it experienced a sudden and intense surge. Prices soared past the 6,500-yuan mark, rapidly advancing toward new highs. This occurred during the bank's semi-annual holiday, fueled by various favorable rumors and heightened investor enthusiasm. Although Huipiao merchants Xinfengyong cashed out 16,000 taels throughout the day and went short, and Tianyuan also sold an additional 5,000 to 6,000 taels, the Shanghai West Side gangs aggressively bought in, with Yiyuan flipping to a long position with 25,000 to 26,000 taels. Hengji also bought in 600 to 700 taels. Small investors were mostly long, and market prices were bid up with no restraining pressure. Consequently, the price rose from 6,445 yuan to 6,570 yuan in the afternoon. It only stopped rising and slightly retreated when news of Japanese warships concentrating in the Lushun area spread. Nevertheless, it still closed up 142 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 60,000 to 70,000 taels. Cash transactions saw Yili paying Chengji 80 taels, and Mingfeng and Shengyuan Yong, along with Xintian Shi and Fengxiang Heji, paying a total of 120 taels. In the afternoon, Yongfengyu paid Chengji 120 taels.

<p>Futures Rise by 140 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) benefited from positive rumors and tight foreign exchange rates, leading to unanimous upward sentiment. Therefore, the market opened at 9:15 AM amidst strong buying, with prices already up to 6,450 yuan, 41 yuan higher than the closing price before the holiday (the 30th). Subsequently, amidst confusion, it rose to 6,465 yuan, then retreated to 6,445 yuan. Gongda, Dafeng, and Xianghe aggressively bought in, while Yifeng tentatively added to their positions. Prices gradually trended upward, reaching 6,490 yuan, as Dafeng, Chengji, Xinfengyong, and Xiangxingyong sold. At 10:30 AM, the price was 6,473 yuan. Yiyuan’s aggressive buying increased, and Dafeng and Renchengyong also bought. When news of the US dollar weakening to 5.3125 yuan spread, prices soared past 6,500 yuan, reaching 6,520 yuan. At noon, Tianyuan aggressively sold short, and Xiangxingyong scrambled to sell. As the foreign exchange rate slightly strengthened, prices immediately retreated to 6,490 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,500 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 2:00 PM, immediately rising 15 yuan to 6,515 yuan amidst continued buying pressure. Individual investors who had bid up prices took profits, pushing the price down slightly to 6,502 yuan. Yiyuan returned with minor purchases, and Hengji, Yida, and Hesheng scrambled to buy. When news spread that it was difficult to settle US dollars at 5.28125 yuan this month, individual investors resumed buying aggressively, further intensifying the upward momentum. The price then rose another 68 yuan, reaching 6,570 yuan. Later, news of Japanese warships concentrating in Lushun caused Yiyuan, along with Tianwu and Xinfengyong, to sell frantically, finally halting the rise and causing a decline to 6,550 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,551 yuan, still a sharp 142 yuan higher than before the holiday. Based on the settlement price of the US dollar at 5.28125 yuan for July, the equivalent price was 6,594 yuan, a discount of 43 yuan. After the close, Tianyuan and others continued to sell, causing a retreat to 6,535 yuan. The price fluctuated by 125 yuan throughout the day. The buying price for the current price gold offered by cash shops was 290 yuan higher than the unofficial futures price, and the selling price was 70 yuan lower than the buying price.

<h3>Yarn Flowers Appear, Impacting the Yarn Market, Golden Horse Futures Gain Momentum, Trading Volume Increases to 30,000 Bales, Market Improves and Yarn Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be strong and trended from stable to rising. This was because many yarn companies with short positions had gone bankrupt, resulting in a shortage of credit. There were many covering shorts, and at the same time, demand from Guangdong was strong. Therefore, the price of 20s and 30s yarn gradually increased, rising by another 20 to 30 yuan. As a result, investor sentiment improved, and the market moved forward. However, some still felt the price was high and took some short positions. However, raw cotton prices continued to rise, increasing manufacturing costs. The high price for 20s Double Horse yarn was 1,642 yuan, and the low price was 1,594 yuan. In the afternoon, there were few attendees at the market. Initial trades were at 1,630 yuan, rising to 1,645 yuan. The final price was 1,625 yuan. Currently, the fundamentals of the yarn market are considered to be solid due to a shortage of some 20s yarn and the difficulty in loosening cotton prices.</p>
<p>Golden Horse morning opening market image was flat and unremarkable, and the initial price was 1,605 yuan, rising to 1,608 yuan. At this time, sellers appeared, and the price fell back to 1,594 yuan. However, major players covered shorts en masse, and exchange rates changed to shortening, and gold prices rose. At the same time, real sales in Guangdong were booming, so buying sentiment turned strong, and the market gradually rose to 1,642 yuan. Those who had made profits in the middle dumped, and then returned a little, closing at 1,627 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 8,000 bales, and the volume of Golden Horse futures transactions had decreased by more than 20,000 bales. This is because after the recent raising and short squeeze, both long and short players did not dare to act, and instead concentrated on the futures market. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,000, Peers 7,000, Total 8,000</p>
<p>Golden Horse Mark Yarn Market Situation. Since the Spot Yarn Market was hit, it has been very firm. This is because spot sales are good, people's hearts are excited, shorts are covered, and bulls are active, and the market has risen sharply. As a result, the July period rose by 40 yuan, the August period rose by 19 yuan, and the September period was newly launched. It was found that the total transaction volume for the day was 29,980 bales, an increase of 13,930 bales compared to before the holiday. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Closing</p>
<p>July 1501 14 0 1498</p>
<p>August 1515 1475 1488</p>
<p>September 1552 1508 1517</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Soars</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is soaring, because the yarn market has risen, and US cotton has returned to rise. In addition, foreign exchange mark-ups are all beneficial to bulls, so cotton merchants have extremely high expectations, and fine velvet cotton prices have seen new highs.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign company foreign cotton transactions, because the yarn market is rising, and at the same time, the factory's demand for goods is eager, and the Shanghai stock is not much, foreign cotton transactions have really turned into a good state. Whether coarse or fine raw materials, people who generally find spot goods are quite excited and enthusiastic. As for foreign-funded yarn factories that purchase directly from overseas, although the ordering situation seems to be slightly inferior due to the inconvenience of transportation and the scarcity of tonnage, people's hearts are consistent due to the high price of US cotton and the good trading conditions of finished products.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is lively and firm, because the cotton production and harvest statistics are favorable to bulls and have risen. Yesterday's closing price was 10 pound sounds higher than the previous day's.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is uncertain, and closing prices are mixed. In the early morning, it first fell due to cotton merchants selling and bulls closing, and then forked due to large support and rebounding. Later, the market fell again due to short sellers, and at the same time rose again due to brokers buying. As a result, closing prices fluctuated by one or two Robi.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Dye Factories Buy Cloth Intensely, Dongbu Market Sees Sudden Windfall Before Closing</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market rose in the morning, and slightly fell back in the afternoon. This was because cloth prices had risen sharply for several days, and hoarding households and dye factories in the same industry were becoming increasingly interested. Factory prices continued to rise. Shenxin Factory opened July futures for Fugui fine cloth at 46.25 yuan and Fugui twill at 43 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan to 2.25 yuan compared to the last decision price.

<h3>Foodstuffs: The Rice Market Fluctuates but Ultimately Settles at Level</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dimi continued to build on a stable base, rising initially and then weakening. The result was still about one yuan higher than the previous market. After the market opened in the morning, there was a supply of public sale Hong Kong rice on the street, and the interest was still weak. However, the Ke gang was very greedy, and apart from some decorations in Ningbo, Nanyang, and rural villages in the interior, there were new packing facilities in Hankou and the Yangtze River area, and speculators seized the opportunity to hoard, so the market immediately rose, rising by one yuan to nearly two yuan, but after the rise, large households dumped, and the profit-taking closings and new retail investors were more willing to sell, so the market rose and fell again. Yinhua Division No. 2 Siam 142.5 yuan, small twist nine 149.5 yuan, period 149 yuan, broken rice 113.5 yuan to 113 yuan, all of which were larger than the previous day. No. 1 current Saigon 129 yuan, No. 2 Saigon once opened to 123 yuan, small twist 124 yuan, but the actual sales were light, and the villagers in the interior and other gangs saw the market price rebounding, their thoughts turned lazy, and they all stopped. However, the stores on the street were still focused on flat rice, and extended to the later market, and finally gave up and depreciated. As a result, the closing price was the same compared to the previous market, with one rise and one fall before and after the price. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is 1267 yuan, and No. 2 is high from 122 yuan to 110 yuan, No. 1 Siam 125 yuan, special 1312 yuan, No. 2 121 yuan, 120 yuan, fire grain 1256 yuan, Qiefo rice 126.5 yuan, 126 yuan, Min Party Zhongguan 126 yuan, small grain 122.5 yuan, 122 yuan, Tokyo tip Zhongguan 112 yuan, 110 yuan, broken tip 956 yuan, rice green 111 yuan, and total transaction volume was 22,000 bags, and Yinhua Division's original bags were 1,200 tons.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin Indica rice is still sparse, so the cargo owners are more determined to sell when they see the early market Dimi continuing to rise, and they are doing their best to call out. However, the interest of Muxiangdian sales is also strong at first, so although they are weak after a move, the market of thick and thin Indica rice can still see an increase of yuan. The early and late rice from the South China Sea opens at 137.5 yuan, 136 yuan, and the Wuxi original package Suken opens at 132 yuan and falls to 127 yuan.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Baiyuan Yunlu of glutinous rice also turned strong as the Dimi continued to be tight, not only the zero stomach was like this, there were also wholesale transactions, and the situation was very tight at the time. The selling price was on par with foreign rice, and it was raised by one or two yuan, but the late market was also sluggish and returned to stability. It is estimated that the opening prices for the whole city yesterday were as high as 1212 yuan, followed by Zhongguan 118 yuan, and glutinous green was as high as 112 yuan, and fell to 106 yuan. The national glutinous rice is still difficult to compare with foreign glutinous rice due to the season and body relationship, and it is still flat. The continuous opening is high at 1212 yuan, and it falls to 118 yuan.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice have arrived in Shanghai again. The French Post Ship Company's Kaiding No. 1 ship arrived in the port yesterday morning with 27,000 bags of rice from Saigon, and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. There is still a large batch of Yangon foreign rice that can arrive within days (Zhu)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Progresses Step by Step - An Increase of Around One Yuan in Three Days -</h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market is progressing step by step, because the street real sales have gradually increased since the Hua factory stopped selling flour at a flat price. In addition, the rice market has risen, and there are quite a few people who absorb and float, but the large gang passenger sales have not yet been launched, so its rise is not too fierce. The city wide opening price of Golden Dragon flour is 33 yuan to 33 yuan and 05 cents, Pudong Zhan 32 yuan and 70 cents, Fort flour 33 yuan and 89 cents, and the new Five Swallow brand US flour shipped from Hong Kong is priced at 33 yuan and 40 cents, Zhonglou brand is priced at 34 yuan, Shuangying flour is 33 yuan, and the turnover is 145,000 bags. The above goods have all risen by three to five corners compared to the previous day, and they have risen by about one yuan in three days. The remaining miscellaneous brands and cold brands have also risen by about half a yuan. However, there is a current abundance of flour, and the source from Hong Kong is endless. The market prospect is also temporarily lacking a good situation, and wheat is without market.</p>
<h3>Grains: Edible Oil Sees Another Hoarding Trend, Corn Continuously Transported Inland</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market situation was very strong, because general investors were stimulated by rumors in the financial market, and the concept of hoarding goods suddenly became eager again, so the market was lifted by one or two yuan. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 122 yuan, 700 listen of Jiangbei local workshop raw oil at a price of 176 yuan, 400 dan of Qing oil from the Dade New Factory at a price of 120 yuan, and 2,000 dan of Qing oil from the Dayou Factory for delivery in July at a price of 120 yuan and 05 corners to 123 yuan and 50 corners.</p>
<p>Yesterday's corn market transported continuously inland, and the Yong Gang also purchased in wholesale, resulting in quite active transactions and a unanimous increase of about half a yuan. The total city transaction volume of Saigon and Dutch corn was 4,000 bags strong (price details in the market price column)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Quite a Few Sugar Importers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were quite a few sugar importers, so people's hearts were prosperous, resulting in a trend that continued to move upward and fiercely. Taikoo Ocean Company opened 1,500 bags of Dutch red in the process of loading, priced at US$3.05, according to the C.L.F. precedent, and Xinyi Company opened 8,000 bags of coarse sand arriving in August and September, priced at US$3.75. The association's auction spot goods two or four coarse white, the most recently arrived new goods, opened at 92 yuan and 3 corners to 93 yuan, 4 yuan, and 5 yuan, and finally closed at 5 yuan and 5 yuan, for 94 yuan and 5 corners, and the goods arriving in March and April 91 yuan to 93 yuan and 5 corners, an increase of two yuan outside, Taikoo car white B mark 109 yuan to 110 yuan, an increase of two yuan outside, DY mark 102 yuan, package head 100 yuan, an increase of one yuan, HY mark 91 yuan to 92 yuan and 5 corners, HM mark 99 yuan to 80 yuan, H mark car red 71 yuan, Dutch red NT mark 72 yuan and 5 corners, KD mark 73 yuan and 5 corners to 74 yuan and 5 corners.</p>
<h3>Hardware Fair Tie Breaks 500 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>The two-hundred-pound American Fair Tie, which is circulating in the market, has been in short supply for half a month. Recently, it has become even more insufficient due to the enthusiastic collection of toy factories, can factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, biscuit factories, and hoarding help on this street. In addition, foreign company orders have been cancelled, and the source has been cut off. Therefore, people's hearts are strangely high, and the market has suddenly seen a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, after several standard prices have risen, they have finally broken through the 500-yuan barrier.</p>

<p>Highest Ideals Maintain Independence</p>
<p>Shanghai American Consul General Rockhead, US Asiatic Fleet Yangtze Patrol Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, and US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment Commander in Shanghai Colonel Howard, all issued "July 4th" messages to the overseas Chinese. Rock said, "Americans all over the world are celebrating the 165th anniversary of American Independence today. After a long and painful experience, we have achieved independence. To this day, all true Americans, regardless of where they live, regardless of race, creed, or political affiliation, regard maintaining independence as the highest ideal. We Americans are extremely proud of enjoying our rights. These rights are part of a free and independent government, inherited from generation to generation, and are what Americans everywhere are thinking about today. The United States has experienced periods of war and peace, suffering and joy, and has been influenced by this unshakeable principle. It would be too much to say that we are determined to maintain independence and will not encounter obstacles as in the past, but we have overcome these obstacles in the past. The free will of the American people is the guarantee that our independence can be preserved."</p>
<p>Serious Threat No Greater Than Today</p>
<p>Glassford's message reads: "One hundred and sixty-five years after our ancestors declared independence, the threat to the lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of their descendants has never been more serious than what we face today. We should pay serious attention to this reality and guarantee each other with our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor, unite strongly, and compete with the courage and spirit of our ancestors against the force that now seeks to establish absolute tyranny over us and those who live like us, as it did in the past."</p>
<p>Full Preparation for Common Defense</p>
<p>Howard's message reads: "The President of the United States has instructed all American people to rededicate themselves to the basic principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence on July 4th of this year. The first basic principle of independence is stipulated in the preamble to the Constitution, which is 'to prepare for the common defense.' Our country's history has shown that this principle has been neglected in the past. Now, to the greatest extent possible, we are fully preparing for the common defense. At the same time, we ourselves or our children must not neglect this necessary principle of independence and freedom in the future."</p>
<h3>Bank of China Merges Three Branches Yesterday</h3>
<p>Three of the Bank of China's branches in the two concessions were closed yesterday (the 3rd). The business of the remaining branches continued as usual. The accounts of the three closed branches were taken over by the remaining branches. The McTaggart Road branch has moved into the Avenue Masnan near Avenue Joffre. The New Gate Road and South City branches have merged into the Hongkou branch, which is currently located at 50 Hankou Road. The Bank of China's move is intended to reduce the scope of operations.</p>
<h3>Fusheng Steamer Encountered Robbery on the Way to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to the shipping industry, the Fusheng steamer of Jardine Matheson in Shanghai was hijacked by pirates on its way to Hong Kong. The pirates then took the ship's owner, Holden, and a Russian escort as hostages. After receiving a distress signal from the ship, Jardine Matheson telegraphed the British naval authorities in Hong Kong to track down the pirates. The two crew members have now been rescued.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of This Unified Bond Paid in Full, Remittances Are Already on Par with Cash, Payment Method May Change</h3>
<p>The 11th redemption of principal of the five types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E of the 1936 National Unified Bonds has been completed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The total amount of principal and interest due for each bond drawn is 6,646,848,400 yuan, which will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks starting on the 31st of this month. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank yesterday that the principal and interest of the Unified Bonds due will be discounted by the Central, Communications, Agricultural, and Farmers Banks. The detailed payment method will be announced by the Ministry of Finance. In the past, Shanghai payments were made by general remittance. Today, remittances and cash have been paid off, so remittances are no different from cash. Although the payment method has not been announced, in order to maintain credit, the principal and interest due will be paid in full.</p>
<h3>Livestock Inspection Fee Increased by 150%</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department issued a notice yesterday regarding the increase in livestock and livestock product inspection fees, stating that from July 1 this year, the livestock and livestock product inspection fees charged by the Bureau should be increased by 150% as specified in the annual fee schedule.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Strengthen Security Starting Today, Red Security Vehicles Patrol the Border</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has strengthened security since yesterday. It is reported that the US Marine Corps will cooperate with the Public Concession Police Department for prevention. Yesterday morning, the Police Department dispatched red security vehicles to patrol the borders of the Public Concession. Special patrol teams were dispatched to conduct searches in various places. It is reported that this security will be tightened day by day and will only end after next Monday. At the same time, the Japanese will also implement stricter security in Hongkou to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>The Weather is Hot, and Cholera is Spreading; Citizens Should Pay Close Attention; A Girl in the French Concession Died from the Disease; Citizens Should Get Vaccinated and Emphasize Hygiene</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Epidemic Hospital discovered three cases of true cholera a few days ago. One had already died, and two had recovered, as previously reported in this newspaper. Now it is known that two cases of true cholera have also recently been discovered in the French Concession.</p>
<p>One Dead, One Recovered</p>
<p>The first case involved an 11-year-old Chinese girl who died of cholera. The second case involved a Chinese woman whose initial illness was severe but later greatly lessened. The Hygiene Research Institute tested these two cases and found cholera bacteria, confirming them as true cholera. However, both cases were transmitted from other cities. The aforementioned girl arrived in Shanghai from Shaoxing by boat on June 21st and already showed signs of cholera at that time. It was found that the girl had not received any preventative vaccination. As for the second case, the Chinese woman boarded a ship in Ningbo on June 20th and received a preventative vaccination on the ship, but the dosage and nature (the quantity of dead bacteria contained) of the injection are unknown. The woman fell ill three days after arriving in Shanghai. Twenty people lived in her house, but only she became ill, indicating that the illness was already latent when she arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Prevention</p>
<p>Regardless, cholera has occurred in the French Concession, which is undeniable. The current health authorities are taking various measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic. All residents, for their own sake and the sake of others, should cooperate to eliminate it. They should pay special attention to their diet, boil water before drinking, and cook and store food properly to avoid contact with flies, as flies are a well-known medium for transmitting diseases. Their feet and sucking tubes spread cholera bacteria. If someone contracts the disease, they should be sent to an epidemic hospital for absolute isolation. Suspicious feces should be disinfected with chemicals (Lysol). To avoid cholera, it is necessary to receive preventative vaccinations. The case of the aforementioned woman teaches us the following three lessons: (1) Preventative vaccinations require a certain period of time to become effective; this time is 15 days. (2) The injection must contain a considerable amount of dead bacteria and dosage to be effective, so one should not be afraid of minor reactions after the injection. (3) Even if preventative vaccinations cannot completely prevent the occurrence of the disease, they can at least greatly reduce its severity. This is why the aforementioned woman was able to recover, while the girl who did not receive a preventative vaccination ultimately died.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Hongkou Relocated</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Japanese side has used the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas as a military transport center, occupying wharves and factories along the Pudong River in Shanghai as barracks or storage places for military supplies. Usually, military vehicles rumbled on the roads in these areas. However, since the day before yesterday, a Japanese military wounded soldier hospital and a military supply station suddenly withdrew, attracting attention from all sides. For example, at the old site of the Samsung Yarn Factory at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Ningguo Road, there was previously an open space adjacent to the Huangpu River. The Japanese side had enclosed it with bamboo fences and turned it into a resting place for the Japanese army. Guards were heavily stationed in front of the gate, and there were more than 2,000 soldiers inside, including infantry and cavalry, who often practiced in the camp. All Japanese military movements often used this place as a starting and ending point. However, since the end of last week, the Japanese troops stationed there suddenly withdrew, and the place is now completely empty. Additionally, the Japanese military wounded soldier hospital at the Yong'an Textile Factory at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road, which had been occupied by the Japanese army since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and housed more than 700 wounded soldiers, was also completely evacuated the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Recent Extreme Weather Changes; Hurricane Hits Luzon Island; Humidity Breaks Records; Accumulated Water in Western Shanghai Not Yet Gone</h3>
<p>The second hurricane following in the Pacific Ocean reached east of Luzon Island at 6:00 AM yesterday and is continuing to move in a northwesterly direction. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the current position of the hurricane is 17 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude. The wind force at the center within 60 nautical miles is six to seven on the Beaufort scale. If it continues to move in a northwesterly direction without changing, the coast of China will be hit.</p>
<p>Low Pressure Passed Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report from the Datong News Agency, the low-pressure system that originated in the eastern part of Jiangxi Province passed Shanghai from the west at 5:00 AM yesterday and quickly entered the Yellow Sea. Therefore, the wind direction in Shanghai has changed, and the weather is expected to improve.</p>
<p>Humidity Reaches 90%</p>
<p>Due to the continuous influence of the moldy rain, the weather in Shanghai has been exceptionally humid, and the goods stored in various warehouses have been severely affected. Those storing goods are under threat. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the recent air humidity has exceeded records. On the 1st of this month, it was 72% to 89%, and on the 2nd, it was 75% to 90%. Goods stored in general are extremely susceptible to mildew due to this humidity.</p>
<p>Water Accumulation in the Western District Difficult to Recede</p>
<p>Since several heavy rains in Shanghai, many roads in the area of the extra-territorial roads in western Shanghai have been plagued by accumulated water. After the recent showers, the water accumulation has increased. Currently, the low-lying roads around Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, Anhe Temple Road, Kaixuan Road, and Columbia Road have not yet receded, causing great trouble for pedestrians. Although the weather has cleared up, there is still no hope of the water receding.</p>
<h3>Various Businesses Consider Market Conditions and Implement Interest Rate Reductions; Excessive Floating Capital and Narrow Lending Channels Make Interest Rate Reductions Necessary to Avoid Losses</h3>
<p>After settling accounts for the first half of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the silver and money industries resumed business yesterday after the holiday period. Various industry markets, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, and cotton yarn, also resumed business and trading at the same time. Regarding the operations of various businesses in the first half of the year, due to the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai, both fixed and current deposits have increased. However, the channels for investment in Shanghai are becoming increasingly narrow. Therefore, although the settlement results still show a profit, it is not as high as last year. The operating policy for the second half of the year is to implement the established policy, reduce deposit interest rates to lighten the burden, and be particularly cautious about lending, especially focusing on mortgage business. Daily necessities are refused as collateral to avoid fueling speculation.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Xingye Implements Check Fees</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with banking circles and learned that after the British banks HSBC and Mercantile first implemented a fee for customers using checks, charging two jiao of national currency per check, various Chinese banks decided to follow the HSBC and Mercantile method and implement it on their own schedules. Now, Zhejiang Xingye Bank and others are implementing a fee for using checks starting in July, charging one jiao of national currency per check, which is deducted from the deposit when used. This means that a checkbook (25 checks) costs two yuan and five jiao, aiming to reduce the abuse of checks by depositors and compensate for the loss of paper and printing costs.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Reduction Methods Are Not Uniform</p>
<p>To alleviate the burden of interest, various banks and money shops have implemented a reduction in current deposit interest rates since the second half of last year. Now, they have canceled the preferential deposit methods previously set and, starting in July, will further reduce the current deposit interest rate for using checks to two li. Fixed deposits will be reduced from five li to two fen. However, the methods are not completely uniform among various banks and money shops. Each bank and money shop sets its own rates based on market conditions. However, for fixed deposits with already agreed-upon interest rates, the interest will be calculated according to the agreed-upon rate. If the depositor wants to renew the deposit after maturity, they must implement the newly set interest rate. Additionally, if deposits are not withdrawn after the due date, no interest will be calculated beyond the due date.</p>
<h3>Workers Arrested in Taikoo Wharf Fight Released; Foreman Gan Renzhong Dies</h3>
<p>After a large brawl occurred a few days ago between old and new workers at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession, many people were injured and sent to the hospital for treatment by the French police. In addition to foreman Gan Renzhong, who died from his serious injuries, there was also an old foreman named Zhou Ruisheng, whose injuries were very critical. More than 30 workers were arrested at the same time. It is now known that the arrested workers were released by the police yesterday.</p>

<h3>A Portion of Electrical Workers at the Telephone Company Stage a Temporary Morning Strike</h3>
<p>The electrical and telephone departments of the Maithe Hurst Road Telephone Company employ 1,500 to 1,600 people. Due to the pressure of making a living, they have successively submitted conditions to the company, requesting improved treatment and increased salaries. However, no agreement has been reached. It is now known that more than 600 employees in the company's electrical department went on strike at 7:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Conflict Between White Russian and French Soldiers in a Pub on Zhubaoshan Road; White Russians Raise Glasses and Cheer "Long Live Russia"; Misunderstanding Leads to Violence, Fortunately Quickly Resolved</h3>
<p>Zhubaoshan Road in the French Concession is lined with pubs and dance halls, and their customers are mostly Westerners and soldiers from various countries. Since the outbreak of the Second European War the year before last, the British and French concessions and military authorities, in order to prevent soldiers from warring countries from engaging in disputes after drinking and to eliminate unfortunate incidents, delineated boundaries, ordering soldiers from warring countries to drink and relax according to the boundaries and not to mix.</p>
<p>Raising Glasses in Celebration</p>
<p>According to reports, a soldier fight occurred in a bar on Zhubaoshan Road after the German-Soviet war broke out. A group of White Russians went to a bar set up by a Russian merchant on Zhubaoshan Road that night to celebrate and drink. They were happily raising glasses to celebrate the victory of the Red Army and shouting "Long Live Russia!" A White Russian raised his glass to a French sailor and asked him to drink a glass of wine. The French sailor refused, leading to a misunderstanding and a dispute.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding and Conflict</p>
<p>The White Russian's companions stepped forward to mediate, but many French sailors in attendance came to the aid of their comrade. The White Russian's companions raised chairs, tables, bottles, and other items to attack the French sailors. The noise reached the outside. Police detectives stationed in the area learned of the incident, entered the bar to stop the fight, and the dispute was resolved. Both sides dispersed, order was restored after only ten minutes.</p>
<h3>Famine in Shaoxing Intensifies; Urgent Need for Food Relief</h3>
<p>Since a portion of eastern Zhejiang was lost, the people have been displaced and do not know what to do, especially with the unprecedented food panic, leading to situations where people are selling their children to buy food. The Shaoxing and Yuyao native place associations in Shanghai, recognizing the severity of the disaster in their hometowns, felt they could not stand idly by. They requested joint relief measures from the Shanghai Red Swastika Society, as the society has branches in Ningbo, Zhenhai, Yuyao, Shaoxing, Shangyu, and other counties, and cooperation with them would be more effective. According to a responsible person from the Red Swastika Society, the most urgent need in eastern Zhejiang is food. They are currently raising funds to purchase rice and are also requesting a portion of American wheat from the American Red Cross to alleviate the immediate crisis. However, the biggest difficulty is the blocked transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang. They are actively finding ways to transport the food there as soon as possible. As for the current relief situation in eastern Zhejiang, there are no detailed reports. The following is a brief account of what is known.</p>
<p>(Shaoxing) The postal and telegraph services in Yuyao are currently unavailable, and the situation there is unknown. However, the Red Swastika Society and the native place association each remitted 100,000 yuan to the area before the occupation to set up congee kitchens and provide relief. Although the remittances were confirmed to have been received, an incident occurred shortly thereafter, and the current situation is unclear. There is also no news from Shaoxing. It is reported that the area is full of starving people and corpses are seen everywhere. The society is very busy with burial work.</p>
<p>(Shangyu) Around the 10th of last month, the city was subjected to a major looting, followed by arson, destroying many houses and leaving many refugees displaced. The Red Swastika Society has established two shelters in the south of the city and in Baiguan, housing hundreds of refugees. At the same time, the Zhejiang authorities, seeing the accumulation of stored grain in the area, are organizing the sale of grain at fair prices in the surrounding villages.</p>
<h3>French Community Prepares for National Day</h3>
<p>The 14th of this month is the anniversary of the establishment of the democratic Republic of France. In previous years, French merchants in Shanghai have enthusiastically celebrated. As the date approaches this year, the French Concession authorities have begun preparations. However, due to the war in Europe, there will be no enthusiastic displays, only celebrations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital This Week's Medical Report</h3>
<p>Since the discovery of Xie Aqi and two others suffering from true cholera at the Yu Qiaqing Road Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, there have been no further discoveries. However, as it is now early summer and the weather is sultry, infection is most likely. On average, about 600 people per day have come to the hospital for treatment this week, with an average of more than 130 inpatients. Currently, it is only the beginning of summer, and there are already so many sick people. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to hygiene and avoid cold foods to reduce the source of disease.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Registers Jewish Refugees; The Goal is to Prevent Undesirable Elements; There are Approximately 10,000 Jews in Hongkou</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese Navy Rehabilitation Class in Shanghai is currently registering European Jewish refugees in Hongkou. A Japanese Navy officer stated that the main purpose of this measure is to determine whether Jewish refugees residing in Hongkou have the necessary permits. The ultimate goal is to determine whether any undesirable elements reside in the Hongkou district. The work carried out so far is only to complete the registration of Jewish immigrants. It is estimated that there are currently 15,000 European Jewish refugees residing in Hongkou, of whom only 6,000 have registered with the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<h3>War Spreads, Production Declines; British and American Purchases of Chinese Goods; Shanghai National Goods Factories Actively Negotiating</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the participating countries in Europe have been rushing to manufacture the items needed for wartime, resulting in a virtual decline in the production of various daily necessities. Not only is it impossible to transfer them abroad for sale, but they are also trying to purchase daily necessities from abroad. The large and small national goods factories in Shanghai, considering the time of war, believe that the time to promote fine national goods has arrived. They are now individually improving quality and gradually increasing production. It is reported that in addition to the various territories in Southeast Asia sending telegrams to order large amounts of fine national goods, British and American merchants have also sent telegrams to order daily necessities. However, ships transporting goods are now being actively negotiated by relevant national goods corporations, so that they can be transported to their destinations on schedule.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a tycoon of a certain national goods factory said that Shanghai's entire national goods industry has been relatively depressed and sluggish over the years due to the impact of the Shanghai War. Domestic sales are depressed, and Southbound sales are also subject to twists and turns from time to time. Not only are there few ships available to transport large quantities of goods, but the unsettled international situation has made those who want to order goods hesitant. Under this situation, the national goods factories in Shanghai have made little progress. Now that exports are booming and there is still room for recovery in domestic sales, all large and small national goods factories are striving to make all their products scientific in order to achieve perfection and compete in the market, hoping to gain a superior position. Therefore, even if we take the small socks factory industry as an example, the number of factories being established is like bamboo shoots after rain.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Exports; Duty-Free Exceeds Taxable</h3>

<h3>Shanghai-Shaoxing Postal Service Restored</h3>
<p>The postal service between Shanghai and Shaoxing was once suspended due to the war. Now that transportation has gradually resumed, it has been restored. Savings and remittances have also been restored.</p>
<h3>Notes on Robberies</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 PM the night before last, three robbers suddenly arrived at the residence of a person surnamed Mou at No. 17 Elkin Road in the Public Concession. Two of them were holding pistols. They forced the victim to reveal where he had hidden his cash. The victim refused and resisted slightly, resulting in the robbers injuring his head with the butt of a pistol. As a result, they still robbed him of 2,500 yuan and escaped.</p>
<p>Near Alabastine Road and Gansu Road, at around 6:00 AM yesterday, a woman was walking through the area when she was suddenly robbed by three robbers. One of them showed a pistol. She was robbed of two gold rings and a watch, estimated to be worth 200 yuan.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Tangshan Road and Xi'an Road in Hongkou at 7:30 PM last night, two Westerners robbed a man, stealing 60 yuan in cash.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Shanghai Native Place Association Seeks Congress News; Initial Unveiling Scores Over 7,000</h3>
<p>The Dinghai Shanghai Native Place Association held the opening of the membership congress on June 29 at the Shanghai Western Restaurant on Guangdong Road and revealed the scores of the solicitation for the first time. More than 50 team leaders were present. The chairman of the General Team, Zhang Kangfu, delivered the opening speech, followed by a report from the Director of Association Affairs. The team leaders then handed in their scores. The total score was more than 7,000. On the same day, enthusiastic people such as Zhou Rangsan, Wu Jingshan, Ding Zihua, and Wu Maoyun, upon learning that the association was organizing a scholarship fund, automatically pledged to donate on the spot, the amount of which was quite considerable.</p>
<h3>Continued Notes on Visiting the Xingxia Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition (Lu)</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning there was heavy rain, and I was bored at home. I read the Shanghai News and saw that there was a Xingxia Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition being held at the Pudong Building, so I drove there. I went around and looked at it and thought that it was magnificent and beautiful beyond description. Although I saw it quickly, I was able to learn a little about the calligraphers and painters of the association.</p>
<p>Among the works on display, the works of Dai Jing'an Sigong were particularly spirited, with his work grand and expansive. His structure was seamless, his brushstrokes were deliberate, and he directly combined the strengths of Xu Tianchi, Zhang Chuanshan, Zhao Yishu, and others, melting them into one. His Hundred Longevity Figures were bold and steady, capturing the essence of the famous Song and Yuan masters; his other small pieces, such as vegetables, fruits, and bottle flowers, were also lifelike. Xiang Jiyun's small regular script was as small as a fly's head, delicate and neat, and was truly a master of the era. Even the three Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist scriptures, the Seal Script Classic of Filial Piety in ink, and the Ancient Text of the Great Learning in ink, were all miniature booklets that could be folded and hidden in a wallet. Sixteen fan surfaces, each able to write five lines, could be said to be very small.</p>
<p>In addition, Min Ruizhi's calligraphy was concise and elegant, with the force penetrating the paper, and those without great skill and strength could not hope to match him. There was also Huang Yunyi's couplet in clerical script, which was ancient, simple, and unpretentious, without any horizontal habits. And the plum orchids and bamboos and stones of the monk Yun Ai, although not much ink was used, were full of natural interest, and one could imagine his leisurely mood and his calm and humorous mind, completely revealed in his brush and ink. Zhu Jicheng's calligraphy, painting, and iron pen were also outstanding works in the association. His calligraphy was bold and unrestrained, and his iron pen was ancient and simple, truly worthy of the name of a master craftsman. Furthermore, Jiang Runshen's figures and landscapes were also rare in recent times. His sketches of figures were no different from those from the Song and Yuan paintings, and the landscapes were charming and pleasing, which was very rare. Although there were too many other writers to list, there were a few more writers that I knew very well and that were known to society, so I had to mention them briefly here. Ms. Mao Suihua was a prominent disciple of Feng Chaoran, specializing in figures and also skilled in landscapes. Because she had been taught by a famous teacher, she had obtained the secrets of the heart and nature, and was naturally extraordinary. Although Zhu Fugan was a prominent disciple of Zhang Daqian and Shan Ma Zi, he was particularly interested in the study of landscapes, so he deeply understood the secrets of his teacher. Ding Guanyan was a prominent disciple of Chen Jia'an of Wumen, and his works on birds and flowers were always valued by the world. Fan Xizhong was skilled in bamboos and stones, and was a prominent disciple of Yang Dongshan. The old master Dongshan was an eminent scholar, so it was appropriate for him to have a talented disciple. Furthermore, Ms. Liu Jie was a prominent disciple of Deng Fenweng, and her calligraphy was very skillful, just like her teacher. In addition, there were not many works by Zhang Shutong on display, only a few, and the most exquisite of them were fan surfaces. These kinds of fan surfaces would not be ashamed to be placed among the Ming and Qing masters. Even more, there were authentic works by Confucius and Mu Dao Ren hanging in the main hall. This was a work of divine inspiration, unlike others, and enough to add luster to the association. I spent three or four hours visiting the association. By then it was already past noon, so I had to hire a car to return home and did not have time to read everything one by one.</p>

<h3>Zhang Chongyu, an Employee of the Sincere Insurance Company, Assassinated; Met Disaster on the Way to the Company in the Morning; Shot in the Chest and Died of his Injuries</h3>
<p>At 8:35 AM yesterday, a shooting occurred at the entrance of Tongfu Lane, west of the Great Light Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Zhang Chongyu, an employee of Sincere Life Insurance Company, who was shot in the chest, the bullet not exiting.</p>
<p>Succumbed to Wounds</p>
<p>The assassin escaped without a trace. Zhang was a native of Guangdong, 40 years old, and resided at No. 3 Wuyu Lane, opposite the Xieqiao General Assembly Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. He had been working at Sincere Life Insurance Company for more than ten years. At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, he took his private chartered car from his residence to the company to work. As he was passing the entrance of Tongfu Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, he unexpectedly encountered</p>
<p>Ambush in That Area</p>
<p>A man wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants. Seeing Zhang approaching, he jumped out to intercept him, produced a pistol, and shot at him. Zhang was shot once in the chest, the bullet not exiting. Blood flowed profusely, and he collapsed in a pool of blood. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assassin took the opportunity to escape with his weapon without a trace. Upon learning of this, the police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives by car to</p>
<p>Rush to the Scene for Investigation</p>
<p>Hua Police No. 1416 summoned an ambulance to the scene, which transported the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, due to damage to his heart and excessive blood loss, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

<h3>Pickpocket Gang Cracked on North Henan Road; Twenty-Eight Petty Thieves Arrested; Leader Wang Hai Also Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Huishi Police Station has recently received repeated reports from pedestrians that they are often robbed when passing near Beibei Henan Road on the boundary road, with the most thefts occurring to travelers entering and leaving the train station. According to the reports, the police, led by Hua Detective Feng Baishun, Deputy Detective Wang Fusen, and Inspectors Liang Yuliang and Liu Zhaonian, disguised themselves and investigated the area at 4:00 AM yesterday. As a result, they captured 28 petty thieves from the "Hard Pickpocket Gang" lurking in the area, and managed to arrest Wang Hai (31 years old), a native of Tongzhou with the nickname "Magic Hands," the leader of the gang. The 29 people were taken to the police station for investigation. The police now deeply hope that the victims of thefts in the area will report to the police station and can claim the stolen goods that will be displayed in the future.</p>
<h3>Workers Snatching Wheat at the New Garbage Bridge; Police Detain Eleven People</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, about 70 or 80 men who looked like workers suddenly appeared on the northern side of Xizang Road, near the New Garbage Bridge in the Public Concession. They formed a group and intercepted the wheat on the tiger carts. Each cart was loaded with ten bags of wheat. All of the carts were overturned by these people. Seeing this, the escort urgently reported to the police station. The police station sent Western Police Head Bowman and detectives to the scene, and arrested 11 people, including Yong natives Guo Shunyuan, and brought them into the police station. It was also learned that the wheat belonged to Hoxinglu Chenxing in the Temple of the Sun.</p>
<h3>Han Xiao Qizi Shot Dead; Held a 10th Anniversary Memorial Feast for His Deceased Father; Returned Home After the Banquet and Ended His Life with a Bullet</h3>
<p>Han Xueming, also known as Xiao Qizi, a native of Funing, residing at Xin Goubang, Tongren Street, Xujiahui, Shanghai, in a gate-less house, was 31 years old. He possessed considerable potential influence. This spring, he was detained by the French police on suspicion of theft and was released only last month. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), Han held a grand memorial feast at the Tongxing Hall on Haig Road, Xujiahui, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of his father's death, sending out many invitations. Around 11 o'clock that night, after the guests dispersed, Han hurried back home. Unexpectedly, as he reached the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Haig Road, a hidden assassin ambushed him in the darkness. The assassin followed him from behind, pulled out a gun, and fired several shots at his head in quick succession. Two bullets hit him in the head on the spot, piercing his left temple. His brains splattered, and he collapsed. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assassin immediately fled with the weapon, disappearing without a trace. Immediately after the incident, the Japanese authorities blocked traffic at the scene and conducted a thorough search, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, the body was examined and then carried by relatives to the nearby Continental Funeral Home for embalming. It is rumored that the murder was caused by an uneven distribution of spoils. It is said that Han had worked as an investigator at a certain gambling den last year.</p>
<h3>Woman Sentenced for Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Li Wei, a woman from Taixing, used to work as a servant for a certain foreigner and took the opportunity to sell the drug heroin for profit. On June 21st, at 6:30 PM, she and her younger brother, Wei Kanglin, carried a suitcase with a hidden compartment containing 190 grams of heroin worth more than 1,000 yuan. They hired a rickshaw and traveled along Xia Shabo Road and Lipu Road, intending to take it back to their hometown for sale. Xie Zhiguang, a detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, discovered them, and they were sent to the Special First Court. After the interrogation, Judge Dong Risheng presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Li Wei to seven years in prison. Wei Kanglin was released.</p>

<h3>From Selling Buildings by Units to Rent Increases</h3>
<p>— Bao Xu</p>
<p>Suddenly, a disturbance arose in the quiet lane. It turned out that the landlord had come up with a new trick: selling buildings by units for 8,400 yuan each—actually selling the right to live there for 14 years, calculated at the current rent of 50 yuan per month, totaling 8,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Wishful Thinking Reveals Your True Colors</p>
<p>Is the price of 8,400 yuan reasonable? Of course not. First, the landlord deliberately ignored interest. According to the interest rate and method of "fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal installment" savings deposit at the Bank of China, as long as you deposit a little more than 5,000 yuan now, you can withdraw 50 yuan per month from the bank, including principal and interest, for the next 14 years. Moreover, the market interest rate is higher than the bank deposit rate. Second, according to the provisions of the Civil Code, the lessor has the obligation to repair the leased property. It can be seen that the current rent must include repair costs. Therefore, if the landlord wants to sell the right to live there, this part of the repair costs should be deducted from the sale price. Third, a one-time payment saves the landlord a lot of trouble, so the sale price should be reduced. This is the same principle that wholesale prices should be lower than retail prices.</p>
<p>The second landlords in the entire lane refused to be outdone and held a general mobilization meeting to discuss the matter. Of course, most of the clear-headed second landlords strongly opposed it, but there were also a few "wealthy fools" who "generously" bought it without thinking, because this was the only way to show their "wealth."</p>
<p>Consideration of the Situation and Rent Increases</p>
<p>After several rounds of negotiation, the landlord was finally able to "consider the situation" and agreed to withdraw the order. However, he then made a new request: a 50% rent increase! The reasons were sufficient:</p>
<p>1. Due to the high rise in housing prices, the monthly rent of 50 yuan, after deducting depreciation, is less than 4% annual interest, which is too low!</p>
<p>2. The currency is too…</p>
<p>Self-deception and specious so-called "reasons" can convince anyone? Regarding the first point, due to the natural increase in property value, the landlord has already reaped a huge windfall without any effort. If interest is to be added to this windfall, it would be too ruthless, wouldn't it? Therefore, in addition to the obligation to pay the natural appreciation tax on real estate to the government, the landlord has no reason to demand a rent increase. Regarding the second point, it is clear that the landlord does not understand the facts. It should be known that the value of currency and prices are mutually causal. The decline in currency value certainly makes prices soar, but the rise in prices also makes currency value fall. Therefore, to avoid the continued decline in currency value, the only way is to control the rise in prices. Therefore, the decline in currency value is not a sufficient reason for a rent increase.</p>
<p>30% Discount, Many Troubles</p>
<p>Reason could not defeat the landlord's endless desires. After much effort, a 30% "discount" was obtained, a net rent increase of 30%. Of course, I could no longer protest against this "fait accompli," but I hope that this "discount on rent increase" is not like a certain lane on Lafayette Road, which came from bribing the bookkeeper.</p>
<p>The rent has increased, and the disturbance in the lane has subsided, but who can guarantee that there will never be a first disturbance in the future? (Borrowed Reward)</p>
<h3>"Heavy Burden"?</h3>
<p>— Xingyun</p>
<p>Carrying a fragrant loaf of bread and walking on the street is always a "dangerous" thing, so I hugged it tightly in my arms, crossed my hands to hold it, and walked with my head down. I was just afraid that a black hand would suddenly come to seize my "lifeline," but it would be a bit embarrassing if classmates or acquaintances saw this "awkward state."</p>
<p>It seemed that "Heaven was not beautiful." I ran into a classmate, a rich man's son, head-on. "Mr. Xing, hello… Eh, why are you holding that bread so tightly? It won't be delicious if it's flattened." "It's hard to say. There are too many loafers on the street. If you're not careful, that bread will surely 'disappear without a trace.'" "Loafers want to rob things?—" He said thoughtfully: "Aren't they afraid of the law?".</p>
<p>"This… I don't know. Fortunately, um, fortunately your brother is a lawyer. You can ask him… I have something to do, I won't keep you company, goodbye." Looking back, he was still thinking quietly.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," he woke up from his "dream." "It's rare that this young master is willing to pay attention to this 'small matter,'" I thought.</p>
<p>Running home, the bread went down my stomach, and I felt relieved, as if a stone in my heart had fallen to the ground with a "thud."</p>
<h3>Speculation Guide, International Physiognomy, Remuneration and Foreign Exchange Calculation, It is Better for You to Talk About the Market</h3>
<p>— Li Bao</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon, another day's work came to an end, and Old Hu was going to visit a first-class recluse in the mountains and forests.</p>
<p>Old Hu has been very trusting of these things lately. I know that he lost money on more than five long positions some time ago. It's really strange! As soon as he loses money, he becomes fond of these things. What he has learned was "taught by a strange person since childhood." It is said that this time he came to Shanghai from Java (?). In fact, his scholarship seems to have reached the "realm of transformation" long ago.</p>
<p>Walking into Room 〇〇〇, ×× Mansion, my vision was refreshed. There was a cash register as soon as I entered the door. Only behind the two doors was the place to talk about physiognomy. It looked somewhat similar to a hospital.</p>
<p>Old Hu took out two yuan, but after the one who collected the money asked for his name, he suddenly said, "Sir, there is an additional handling fee of 30%."</p>
<p>Old Hu turned around and looked at me, as if to say, "They're still playing tricks?"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything and followed Old Hu into the inner suite—the physiognomy room. Naturally, there were a few polite greetings at the beginning, and then we slowly approached the topic. This physiognomist, who didn't have a high nose, began to speak in Chinese: "What kind of physiognomy do you want to talk about, brother? The remuneration here is—look! From ten yuan to a thousand yuan. As you please!"</p>
<p>"Didn't your advertisement say two yuan? I've already paid it outside."</p>
<p>"That's right, that's registration. The rules here are that the physiognomy fee is negotiated in person."</p>
<p>"So expensive!" Old Hu looked at the remuneration list, which I don't know who had set, and said in surprise. This person's tone was a bit teasing:</p>
<p>"Expensive? Not expensive at all! A few days ago, brothers here were all calculating in Hong Kong dollars. Now we've changed to Shanghai money. If we followed the original practice, it would be even more expensive. One dollar would be equal to four yuan, seven dimes and a half in legal currency."</p>
<p>So they didn't talk about physiognomy and started talking about the market. As a result, Old Hu got the most basic ten yuan. The subject was "Brief Discussion on the Passing Years." I don't know how, when the one outside ran over to "ask for the money," he also collected a handling fee of 30%. Old Hu spent fifteen yuan and six dimes in total. What did he get? — "Your face, sir, has a full forehead and a square chin, like the character 'same'. According to the physiognomy, you will never have to worry about food and clothing in your life… However, your seal is dark. Not to flatter you, it seems that you are not very lucky right now… If you get to August or September, you can enter a better state…"</p>
<p>Stepping onto the elevator, Old Hu breathed a sigh of relief. He seemed to have found satisfaction in these rambling Jianghu terms. As for me, I was even more satisfied: I didn't spend a penny and learned about physiognomy.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although Begonia had never read a single English word and didn't understand what they were saying, she found it very interesting to listen to.</p>
<p>A female student sitting next to Mei Bao suddenly saw Begonia through the glass window and secretly winked at Mei Bao. Mei Bao quickly turned her head and gave a shy and happy smile towards the window.</p>
<p>"Mei Bao, it's me?" He almost wanted to shout that out.</p>
<p>When Mei Bao turned her face to look at him a second time, Begonia's face was pressed tightly against the glass window.</p>
<p>"Wu Meiying?" Just as the two of them were watching each other longingly through the window, the teacher on the platform suddenly shouted this name loudly, which made Begonia almost want to hide away immediately, while also fearing that doing so would make the teacher blame his beloved daughter.</p>
<p>"No one can say it completely. Why don't you tell me?" The teacher put on a very gentle smile, apparently he had not yet discovered Begonia outside the window. Even if he had discovered it, he had no intention of blaming Meiying.</p>
<p>"Shall, will auxiliary verb, receive, find, transitive verb; talk, smile, intransitive verb; snows, rains, impersonal verb," Mei Bao stood up from her seat and rattled off many English words, which sounded like a little foreigner to Begonia's ears. "Very good, sit down?" The teacher waved his hand, telling Mei Bao to sit down, and said to the other students: "Wu Meiying is really the most hardworking student, so she always gets first place on every exam. You are all about to graduate, and you still can't say all four types of verbs completely. Everyone is older than Wu Meiying, so why is no one as good as her?" (149)</p>

<h3>Reflections After Movie Stars Go to War</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>Charles Boyer was the first movie star to actually participate in the war in this European war. Now, although he has returned to the studio and continues to work, the general public does not know the details of his participation in the war. It was not until recently that a detailed record was seen in Silver Screen magazine. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Going to France to Film</p>
<p>After Charles Boyer finished filming "All This, and Heaven Too" in Hollywood, he went to France at the request of the film company to film "LeCarsair". At that time, the war had not yet broken out, but the situation was extremely tense, and the war clouds were overwhelming, with a touch-and-go situation. His relatives and friends all advised him not to go to Europe for the time being, and to wait for the evolution of the European situation before deciding whether to go or not. However, he felt that it was a very meaningful thing to return home to make a film, so he resolutely left the United States for France amidst the tense situation. When the filming was halfway through, the situation in Europe became increasingly tense. His new film was being filmed on the banks of the Nile. Seeing the situation becoming more tense, he sent his wife to her mother's house, which was safer, and then he returned to the city of Nile alone to continue filming his new film.</p>
<p>Conscripted into the Army</p>
<p>On the night the war broke out, France launched a very extensive national general mobilization. Because of this, filming work had to be stopped. Since Boyer was also a French citizen, he had to return to the city of Figeac (his hometown) to await conscription. In less than a day, the national general mobilization reached him; so Boyer joined the army and was assigned to the 37th Artillery Regiment. However, shortly after joining the army, he was sent to the city of Yuxiong for initial training. At that time, France was fully defending the Maginot Line. So, after a short period of training, he followed the whole team to the front to defend the Maginot Line.</p>
<p>Army Life</p>
<p>When their companions discovered that he was the "Napoleon of the Silver Screen," a movie star, they made various taunts. "Look!" the artillerymen said, "It's little Napoleon! Isn't it? Heavens! He's become so terrible, so pathetic! Ha! That great Mr. Napoleon is now only fit to be a groom." This seemed to slap Boyer in the face. To those companions, it was just said casually and there was no particular malice, but Boyer was filled with unhappiness when he heard it. However, because discipline was strict in the army and partners were not supposed to quarrel, he had to turn a deaf ear. Indeed, the Napoleon who had dominated the silver screen had lost his prestige at that time.</p>
<p>Return to the Studio</p>
<p>Just as he was enduring humiliation and fighting hard against the enemy, an order came: it said that under the current situation in France, people over 40 were not needed in the army, and Boyer was already 42 years old, exceeding the age of military service, so he had to leave the army and return to the studio to pursue his old career. Although he lived in a foreign country, he still missed his homeland very much. He once told reporters: "Ah! The scenery of Paris is so memorable, but when the artillery fire sounded, the bombs fell straight from the sky, the beautiful and peaceful fields were shattered, and huge armies were killed in the retreat, with no one spared. Tens of thousands of homeless people and refugees were running around like frightened beasts. Unless they were so tired that they fell asleep, everyone was silent. That kind of tragic situation will never be forgotten. Now I am still preparing my blue-gray military uniform, ready to join the Free French Army, whether it is to drive a horse, dig trenches, or be used as Nazi cannon fodder, I am waiting for any fate. Because no matter what, I am still a free Frenchman!"</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in Qiong Yuan (A Novel)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12:  Utter Helplessness Like Ning Wu</p>
<p>Madam Liu was also the daughter of a military family. Her jade-like face was pure and beautiful, and she had some knowledge of martial arts. She was the same age as Zhou Yuji. In the past, she had ridden alongside Zhou Yuji on hunts, wearing a sword and carrying a bow, resembling a valiant female general. She very much wanted to follow her husband to fight the bandits, but Zhou Yuji firmly instructed her to serve his mother and take on the responsibilities of a son, so she could not fulfill her wish. After the mother and son, husband and wife, and father and son met and exchanged greetings, the old lady rubbed her old eyes and carefully looked at Zhou Yuji's face and body before saying, "My son, why have you returned instead of defending Daizhou?" Zhou Yuji was startled upon hearing this, realizing that his mother did not yet understand the reason. However, as the matter could not be concealed, he glanced at Madam Liu and briefly explained that the bandits had broken through Daizhou and he had retreated to defend Ningwu. Madam Liu hurriedly apologized to her mother-in-law. The old lady nodded and said, "So that's how it is. Of course, you must be loyal to the country and protect the region. However, the bandits are rampant and should not be underestimated." Zhou Yuji said, "Our forces are far outnumbered; our troops are truly too few. I have requested assistance from the imperial court and sent people to General Jiang Rang in Datong to request reinforcements, but there has been no news, and not a single soldier has arrived. Daizhou has already been captured. I fear this pass will be difficult to hold for long. I would have no regrets to die for the country, but I am full of worries and anxieties because I cannot protect my white-haired mother. I wish to send my son to accompany you to a neighboring province or prefecture to seek temporary refuge for a while, to avoid suffering terror here in vain. I wonder what my mother thinks?" After listening to her son's words, the old lady sighed and said, "I heard that the mother of Wang Ling was able to teach her son to achieve fame. How can I, in my twilight years, cling to the last rays of the setting sun and fail to help my son become a loyal and good person? The ancient saying goes, 'Complete loyalty cannot coexist with complete filial piety.' At this time of imminent war, you have a duty to defend the territory. Go and wholeheartedly kill the bandits. Do not be attached to your old mother. If you die in battle, your name will be remembered in history, and the Zhou family will also have glory. If Ningwu cannot be defended, I am willing to die here rather than flee far away to live on in disgrace. I will tell you what the ancients said: During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Su Jun was tyrannical and launched a military rebellion. At that time, the official Bian Hu was loyal and unyielding, and he fought Su Jun alone with his sword under the palace gate and died. Bian Hu's sons and wife all followed him in martyrdom."

<h3>Comments on "The Proposal" and "Gilding"</h3>
<p>— Qingxin</p>
<p>"The Proposal" and "Gilding," which have been widely publicized in the theater world for a long time, have been performed hastily. These are two comedies, so the audience laughed continuously during the performance, and the audience was overwhelmed with laughter.</p>
<p>"The Proposal" is a one-act play. Although it is so short, it describes the society's snobbery and shallow views and the greed of local tyrants and evil gentry in every detail. Indeed, in an occasion of "valuing clothes over people", today a lot of misers have been produced, who often put their property on the neck collar to live on; As for Li Shouzhen, after knowing Zhao Baogui's intentions, he was so anxious and helpless, which is totally childish. But there is still one thing to be considered, here, Li Erye pretended to have leg pain, but after hearing Zhao Baogui's statement of his intention, he jumped up without turning around, which seems to be a bit too straightforward. As for the two disabled characters in the play - Zhao Baogui (cripple) Li Shouzhen (hunchback), in terms of technology, they have made considerable gains.</p>
<p>"Gilding" is a two-act comedy, adapted by the famous playwright Cao Yu. It describes the foolishness of Dr. Ma Shouqing, who has no ability. (Writing Western cuisine names on prescriptions, isn't that a joke?) As for the family property, from furniture to everything else, it belongs to others; And he even hired people to pretend to be patients to cover up the bleak scene of few visitors, and even shamelessly bragged, with a bank manager in his mouth, and a big man upright, this situation is not uncommon in today's isolated island. When the two families visited relatives, both sides were people who "pretended to be rich", and as a result, they were all exposed, and the good thing almost turned into a tragedy. Fortunately, Zhao Ershu's quick talk and teaching them is really the right medicine for modern people who like to be extravagant and unrealistic. In terms of actors' skills, Han Fei, who has always appeared in front of the audience as a pretty boy, actually played an old man who was neither new nor old this time, which is really interesting. And Bai Li's role as Mrs. Ma is also very natural, which is worth mentioning; Mu Hong's role as an Indian is very realistic in terms of posture and costume, so that people can hardly believe that he is a Chinese man. Others, Zhao Wenming, played by Tianran, is very much like a prodigal son, but in terms of movements, it is always better to tend to be natural. If he achieves this, he is guaranteed that his future will reveal a glimmer of dawn.</p>

<h3>(9) James Cagney</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>Born in New York on July 17, 1904, while studying at Columbia University, he joined the wrestling team. Therefore, he has achieved great success in sports and art. After graduation, he entered the amusement park to play a Jewish child. However, before long, his excellent acting skills made him become the leader of the park. It wasn't until 1931 that he jumped onto the screen. His first film was called Sinner's Holiday. His wife is called Frances Vernon. His most recent film is "The Fighting 69th".</p>
<h3>Random Talks on "Martial Actors" on Shanghai Stages (2)</h3>
<p>— Sui Jingchun</p>
<p>Gao Xueqiao: Gao Xueqiao, the brave martial actor of Tianchan, has a good relationship with people inside and outside the troupe. He has been performing on the stage for the longest time. I still remember that when Gao Ling first came to Shanghai, he was on the old Gongwu Stage in Zhengjia Muqiao, hanging the first sign and arranging the new play "Big Knife Wang Wu", which caused a sensation. Judging from his martial arts skills, he has a solid foundation. The play "Driving Chariot General" is his masterpiece. One-Branch Plum in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" and Tianba in "Golden Dart Huang Tianba" are very suitable for his identity, so his reputation is growing day by day, and he is deeply valued by the authorities. Recently, Song Baoluo performed the full version of "Wu Xianghou", Xueqiao went to Jiang Wei's role, magnificent, side style is very good, it seems that Yang Ruiting in the winter last Sunday once performed "Tielong Mountain" to go to this role is better, because Gao Ling is in his prime of life.</p>
<p>Liang Huichao: Liang Huichao is now re-affiliated with the Gengxin Stage. His art is becoming more and more sophisticated. Both short and long dramas are in accordance with the rules and regulations, and there is absolutely no atmosphere of the Waijiang School. Ma Chao in "Jiameng Pass", I think he played the best. "Golden Leopard" is his masterpiece, but playing a certain role of Sun Wukong will inevitably be reduced in color. The so-called peony is good, but it still needs green leaves to support it. The various roles he has played in "New Journey to the West" are also highly praised by the audience.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng: Zhang Yipeng has the elegant name of "Living Monkey", but at present, there is not only Yipeng who can perform monkey dramas. Wang Guiqing is also good. The depth of his skills and the lifelike expression are difficult to match. The name of "Living Monkey" is indeed not an exaggeration, and he deserves it. "Siping Mountain", "Yaguan Tower", "Wu Song", and "Taking Beihuzhou by Wisdom" are all very interesting. In recent years, Zhang has been in a high position and will not do anything unless he is the main character. It is rumored that his relationship with his father, Gai Jiaotian, has always been cold, but evidence from his recent visits to see his father's illness in the past two months shows that Yipeng is filial.</p>
<h3>Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox</h3>
<p>(Reply to Director Hu) (1) It is indeed easy to get pregnant within a week. (2) I am afraid there are considerable abuses. (3) There are many contraceptive methods; but it is not appropriate to make them public because they are related to hindering the purpose of human survival competition.</p>
