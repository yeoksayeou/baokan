<h3>日本南進野心不戢美準備派艦隊至遠東　所謂新秩序與美政策背道而馳　英美澳荷合作足粉碎日本迷夢</h3>
<p>華盛頓國務副卿威爾斯對於報載所傳如日本實行南進、美國擬將艦隊調至菲列濱之消息、拒絕批評、僅稱、此等問題應詢海軍部、（十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓據此間今日若干報紙之消息、華盛頓人士現所考慮者、不爲歐洲戰爭問題、而爲美國大艦隊行將出現於遠東以阻遏日本侵略行爲之可能性、「華盛　時報．與「先驅報」皆言現有　據皆表示如日本攻擊新加坡或企圖佔據荷印、則羅助福總統擬　令艦隊開往遠東、遠東局勢之緊張、已使德國將侵犯英倫之消息不復佔今日重耍新聞之地位、各報社論亦表示戰事將在東方蔓延之嚴重性、雖戰禍爆發之期似已展緩、然危機現仍存在、而在日本與西方列強間利益上根本衝突不消滅時、月將　　存在、</p>
<p>「華盛頓明星　」對此局勢，論之頗詳、其言略謂、駐美英大使哈立法克斯曾稱、今之鵠的在保持時局勿聽共粉碎、但若本維持其侵略政策、以不利於立塲堅決之列强、則此鵠的何能達到乎、除非任何一方讓步，欲免衝突不可得也、此間現尚未有任何一方可予讓步之徵象、局勢極端嚴重殆無可疑、外國大使在華盛頓就職時所遇之嚴重狀況、從未有如此次日大使野村所遇者、野村其亦知之乎，美日關係既因三年半以來日本征服中國之嘗試而趨緊張、復因日本依附軸心公然欲利用三國盟的約以洩其所謂之「新秩序」而愈惡化、荀野村來美欲提倡一種「新秩序」、則必不能希望得美國之同情、蓋日本所行之侵略政策、與美國所堅持之原則大相逕庭也、中國自己處理共生活之權和、與日本前會聲明　守的公約所扣保均等機會夕神聖權利、亦皆包括於此原則之中、日本須知能改善其對美關係者、厥爲事實而非空青云、</p>
<p>「華頓郵報」亦落專論略謂、國務卿與英澳荷蘭駐使之談話、當可爲對日之警告、而使之覺悟其在東南亞洲成立帝國之迷夢、將受當頭之棒喝、美英荷所表示之利益一致、定將發生行動一致之後果、其可能性有非日本島國所樂聞者、今東京在本週杪已表示極大之恐慌、此誠爲甚有意義之一事、雖倐然而起的對美戰爭之想像、已使日本人民反對南進之情緒、由流動而結晶、然日本人民對美和好之志願殊不可恃、因決定對美和戰之權、不操諸日本人民之手、但繫於日本海陸軍閥也、其可使日本軍閥逡巡却步者、除東南亞洲侵略行動勢必引起各有關係國的堅强反抗之現實外、殆無他法、美英澳荷其速成立完全諒解、以商定應付日本南進威脅之行逕哉云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>中日戰事有關大局　美應全力予華援助　美政府大員昨廣播</h3>
<p>華盛頓聯邦安全行政員麥克納脫（前任菲島總督）昨日廣播稱、中日戰事、已成爲菲列賓外衛防禦之「初步行動」、麥氏稱、根據中日事件之性質而言、中國之勝利與「吾人對和平之希望、已不可分離」、渠敦促再進一步以經濟援華、俾能增强美國自身之外衛防錢、同時羅斯福上校及著作家章比倫氏、亦相繼廣播、麥氏於廣播時、對菲島現時猶未武裝一事表示遺憾、羅斯福上校則要求政府宣示其遠東政策、（十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶時局略形緩和之後、英方忽勸告僑民自中國淪陷區撤退、幷不加以何項區別、同時又在星加坡附近海面安放魚雷、實已令人不無意外之感、時局雖仍嚴重、但若推測日本在德國對於英國各島獲有重大戰果之前、不致出以不可挽救之舉動、似非過於大膽之言、要之中國在日本各項冒險舉動中、不虞有何損失、現正靜候事變相機予以應付云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇日重開　商務談判</h3>
<p>莫斯科　去年四月即告停頓之蘇日貿易談判、昨在此間對外貿易部正式重開、由日本駐蘇大使建川·莫斯科日大使館參贊宮川·與蘇聯對外貿易委員會長米高揚·副委會長加昂諾維區·會談一小時半、（路透）</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇日兩國商務談判、昨在此間重開、此爲日本外交代表建川及其他人員長期努力之結果、建川提出交換貨物之計劃一通、蘇政府將於明日答覆之、此間日本方面對會議之進行、極爲樂觀、（十八日合衆）</p>

<h3>日本終屜掩飾惶懼　責英造成遠東危局　星島完成防禦準備</h3>
<p>東京一讀賣新聞﹂今晨社論、略謂日本現仍寗靜如午夜之海、乃英國竟大聲疾呼侈言遠東局勢之嚴重、其理由何在、誠令人費解、倫敦旣屢作遠東戰事行將發生之警告、而華盛頓復有美英澳荷舉行太平洋聯防會議之消息、雖會議內容無從知之、然其所討論者、當爲應付太平洋戰爭之具體辦法、此乃司想像而知者、星加坡一帶海面乃國際通商大路、今英國巳埋雷於此間、是則釀成遠東危局之責、果誰負之歟云、（十八日路透爲）</p>
<p>東京據「朝日新聞」載稱、星嘉坡附折敷設水雷、足以妨礙日本航業、對於日木至印度及菲洲之航錢、影響尤鉅、且此項水雷區域有擴展之可能、可視爲封鎖日本之措置云、「報知新聞寂稱、英國在馬來亞設防、泰國應視爲挑釁行動云、（十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京「朝日新聞」頃載稱、三井洋行職員大田甫自星嘉坡返此、據談稱、星嘉坡港英國當局管理日本僑民日見嚴峻、該港四週業已敷設水雷、沿岸並設有砲臺與碉堡、駐軍每次調防、必舉行燈火管的制、演習達三四日之久、日僑離去之後、即不許重返該處云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東京「日日新聞」今日載稱、日本願意舉行世界會議、以結東目前之戰事、該報　英美對遠束之局勢、作無謂之惶恐、並言倘世界各强國能聚首一堂、當回解決各種困難、（十八日合　電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>太平洋上的爆炸因素</h3>
<p>日本現在成了太平洋上唯一的不安因素，而爲全世界視綫所注。可是，據日本外務次官大橋前天在議會裏解釋這個現象，却說是由於「有關列强對日本過份恐懼所致；」而這種恐懼的來源，則完全因爲英國一散佈虛僞情報，說日本準備即刻南進。」因此，他接着就勸告列强不必一過份恐懼」日本，因爲日本南進是側重和平手段，而並非施用武力，以自招破損云云。這據十六日倫敦星期泰晤十報所論：英國目前所最担心的，却是日本受德國驅使，搆成德義日三國集團戰略的一翼，也像去年義國在地中海似的，不久在太平洋上掀起巨浪，配合德國春季進攻，打擊英美，以圖挽回這一集團的共同頹勢。該報復發出警告：f如果日本要模仿墨索里尼的話，最好牠先慎重攷慮一下自身未來的命運！」所以，在今天太平洋上，日本這一因素所造成的不安，實在可以析爲三點：第一，並不是因爲牠立即主動的南攻，而是因爲三國集團勢成騎虎，牠也不得不被帶橫衝直撞。第二，並非因爲牠有充足的兵力資源和餘暇，於對中國戰爭的同時，另行冒險，而實在是爲了挽救本身及其同盟國的根本敗運，不得不作最大的挣扎。第三，列强現在對於日本。也並不是所謂「恐懼」，而僅僅是對太平洋整個局勢因牠而受到更進一步擾亂的担心。</p>
<p>從第一點來說，德義日三國集團裏，在實力上，德國無疑居於領導地位。義大利因爲地理上處於德國勢力直接籠罩之下，固然早已無法抗衡；即連遠東的日本：也不得不逐漸惟德國的馬首是瞻；這是自然的法則，弱小者終歸是追隨於强大者之後。而且，自從三國同盟宣佈之後，英美及其殖民地的物資與市塲，已大部對日本施行封鎖；今後牠所仰仗的，除去原料方面，有一部份可以取自荷屬東印度外，其餘所需，假定爲德義方面所能設法供給，惟有由陸上經過蘇聯。和歐洲大陸間保持聯繫。然德義所能供給者極微，故日本終會要很快的抵抗不了英美經濟壓力及海洋封鎖。即就對蘇關係言，日本現在唯一的倚賴，就是德國對於蘇聯的斡旋；最近H本當局一再强調對蘇關係調整的必要，就是企圖通過德國，設法緩和日蘇間的緊張，以求後顧無虞，併力南下；，這一着不能成功，則日本還待德國從西邊牽制蘇聯。所以在情勢上，日本現在絕對無法不緊隨德義之後。倫敦華盛頓最近一再電傳，希特勒正在施用壓力，逼日本進攻英國遠東屬地，和他自己大規模的攻勢配合。以便分散英美的力量和注意。列强的目下最担心的，主要還在這裏，而並不是單純怕日本自動冒險。</p>
<p>第二，日本的「南進一，本是懷抱多年的夢想，這次歐戰未爆發前，牠的最大阻碍，是歐洲列强及美國監視的嚴密，以致不得不予擱置，而先舉行對中國的冒險。歐戰爆發，牠以爲大好機會到了；可是冉自省察之後，亦自覺中日長期的大戰裏。牠的國力已經大大削弱，所有南進的要求，全都變成爲虛聲恫嚇，而沒有實力做牠的後盾。像去年對越南的要求，雖然當時法國已經戰敗，但也公然加以抵抗，而最後的接納，這是由於日本加入三國同盟後，德國施用壓力所致。再比如日本目前原料的恐慌情形，已經大大增加了牠對荷屬東印度依存的程度，爲牠設想，牠絕不願在這一帶發生戰事，招致對物資的破損。大橋次官所說的這一點，倒是由衷之言。所以從國力方面來說，日本目前祇有日見削弱，而絕不比歐戰爆發以來任何時改進，然則何以目前太平洋上却特別緊張起來？這最主要的根源，却便是德義日三國針對着美國的儘量援助各民治國家，便不得不希望先行打敗各民治國。日本固然不得不開始在東方有所動作，但即使爲牠自身設想，　美關係已完全沒有改進希望的今天，牠縱使不敢逕行對美國動手，勢也不得不企圖搶先切斷中國西南的國際交通路綫，使根據f租借法案」的一切物資接濟，將來實際無法到達中國。而實現這一企圖的最妙辦法，當然莫過於侵人泰國，威脅英屬緬甸和印度：於是鼓煽了泰越糾紛，取爲可乘之隙。然泰國的態度到底如何，以及萬一日本提出要求時，泰國能否拒絕等等，都還是疑問。而一日日本貿然侵人泰國，英美立刻反應時，那末，整個太平洋上就會立刻捲起了戰禍。</p>
<p>第三，爲德義着想，日本最好能向英美的各屬地進攻；爲了日本自身對中國的戰事，牠當然要側重亞洲西南一帶。但不管如何，牠沒有法子直接進攻美國，或進攻英國的心臟部份。同時，日本自己的核心致命部份，却都暴露在英美海空聯合力量的突擊可能之下。而在軍力對比上，中英美三國的海陸空聯合力量，對日一定可以操必勝之券，這是無庸懷疑的。所以如果說對太平洋掀起大規模戰爭，有人「恐懼」的話，那末，與其說是英美，還不如說是日本本身。不過，英美在可能範圍內，是不願見太平洋另起戰事的，所以牠們當然不會先行動手；但如日本先動作，那時戰事就無法延遲和避免了。太平洋上戰爭爆發乎？不爆發乎？一切關鍵就在於日本今後的動作？</p>
<h3>中美平準基金　不久可訂立合同　法幣信用更將鞏固　寇利改今日飛成都　在渝考察告一段落</h3>
<p>華盛頓官方正式宣佈、中美平準基金之合同、現仍在商議中、不久即可締結、（十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓中美之借款及平準基金、係宋子文及胡適從中辦理、羅斯福總統先於去年宜布貸給中國美金五千萬兀、嗣又准許官方墊給平準基金美幣五千萬元、美財長摩根韜、曾立即開始與參衆兩院主要人物會議、得其批准」財政專家雖於平準問題迄研究未輟、認爲極能恢復中國人民對於法幣之信心、而杜絕外匯之投機、官方亦會表示、對華新借款能使中國購得材料、無庸動用外匯、總統參贊寇利博士係一經濟專家、現正在重慶研究中國之經濟及財政問題、（十八日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶本定今晨飛往成都之寇利、狄伯里斯、及美國經濟代表團之其他團員等、因氣候惡劣、擬乘之飛機、今晨　阻於成都、遂未成行、大約將改明日啟程、美大使詹森、海軍副武官表克休少校、外次徐謨、及宣傳部副部長董顯光均將同行、在蓉作一二日勾留卽將返渝、因美經濟代表團各團員、定三月一日左右返抵華盛頓、衆料該團由蓉返渝後、將立卽起程前往香港、聞美經濟代表團在留渝期內、曾研究中國政府各公團所供給關於經濟·財政·貨幣·物價·食糧·交通·運輸·及出產之資料二十餘種、該團與中國當局之談話、始於二月十日、至昨日已告結束、林主席昨日午後曾招待寇利·狄伯果期·及去任之詹森大使、中美文化協會定二月二十日設宴招待美國經濟代表團、（十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>新生活運動七週年紀念　蔣會長廣播演講詞　檢討已往新運工作之效果　指示今後推要點與意義</h3>
<p>重慶新生活　動促進總會蔣會長、爲新生活運動七週年紀念日、十八日晚八時、向國內外同胞發表廣播演說、大要如次、全國同胞、在我們神聖抗建已進入第五年頭之初、又逢到新生活運動的七週年紀念日、新生活運動的主旨就是「明恥敎戰」新生活迷動的用意、在造成我們國民能耐苦忍痛、不畏飢寒、不懼强暴、整齋嚴肅、勤勞儉樸的戰時生活、使我們</p>
<p>整個民族</p>
<p>能在求生競爭非常的時代中、奮鬥犧牲、而求得進步與發展、使我們國家能獲得永久的獨立和自由、我們抗建到今、所以能愈戰愈强、實際上七年來新生活運動推進的效果雖是不少、然而我們今天以後、應該怎麼樣再接冉厲、自厲自强、以完成仇建勝利、達到</p>
<p>建國成功</p>
<p>這個任務何等重大、因此我在這個紀念日、對已往新運工作的效果、不能不作一番檢討、　時並將今後推進新生活運動的要點與力行的意義、懇切向各位回胞說明一下、促起全國軍民的反省及自覺、自從民國二十三年春間、我在南昌發起新生活運動、到今天已經七年了、這</p>
<p>七年之間</p>
<p>我國政治軍事經濟敎育各方面、已經逐漸的蛻化改進、道種種　步、有許多都是受着新生活述動的影響、雖然是無形的、其實是很深刻的、二十三年新運未發起以前、我們國家的統一也沒有完全實現、地方自治更沒有基礎、在軍事上作戰精神還缺乏訓練、民家組織更配合不上</p>
<p>戰時需要、在經濟上是國家職業幼稚、國民生產不足、在敎宵上是思想錯雜、敎育者很少能明瞭人格化導、與提高民族精神的重要、我們整個生活是充滿着貪汚奢靡怯懦因循等等的舊習慣、而沒有高尚樸實男敢生動等建國的新氣象、現在呢、我們決不敢稍存矜誇自滿之心、也不諱言除惡</p>
<p>還有未盡、但是我們國家社會個人生活的各方面、與從前不同了、我們的國家已實現眞正的統一、我們的政治在此統一領導之下、正在向提高効率的路邁　、我們的軍民已有堅强勇敢的戰鬥精神、和整齊嚴肅的戰鬥紀律、無論前方後方男女老幼、</p>
<p>共同一致、在整個敵愾衛國的神聖意志下奮勇作戰、誓死不屈、我們的經濟、有不斷補充的與新生的建設、國家企業和私人生產相配合、更見活躍、我們的敎育已推及於德行人格的化導、與民族精神的提高、我們的社會已產生了許多合乎</p>
<p>新運標準的新精神尤其我們國民的思想、更能排除了許多錯雜迷離的觀念、與淺薄粉紜的心理、凡屬愛國的同胞、都一致接受了三民主義的立國最高原則、成爲我們共同的信仰、（未完）（十八日電）</p>

<h3>美圓支票戶將結束　法幣價格益堅挺　美匯出籠投機商受打擊　新辦法定於三月起實行</h3>
<p>新聲社云、美商花旗·大通·友邦·美國運通等四銀行上海方面、經聯合決定、自三月一日起對美金存票存款結束、停止開立美金支票存款戶、以前之美金支票存款戶、准許匯往紐約、或移作儲蓄戶、照常憑儲蓄　直接向各行櫃台上支取、惟不得使用支票、至於中國法幣戶、則不在此限、聞上項辦法、係預防性質、而免美金支票存戶濫發支票並鄭重聲明是項措施、並不影響存戶利益、及整個上海金融、盼望各存戶切勿累信外界之謠傳、</p>
<p>法幣價格　昨日猛漲</p>
<p>自此間美商銀行宣佈、自三月一日起將取消一切美金支票存戶後、法幣價格、即見堅挺、且創本年度最高紀錄、收盤時、法幣一百元漲至美金五元又八分之七高價、據商界人士稱、美商銀行採取此項新辦法後、已完成太平洋一旦發生戰爭時、將自遠東撤退之初步準備、因此舉不惟保障銀行方面之利益、抑且保障存戶之利益也、彼等又指稱、戰事若爆發、美商銀行如不於事先作此項新準備、則必將發生困難、今既作此項準備、當可應付裕如、本市外滙市塲、自聞發表新辦法後、即有大批美滙出籠、與過去數日之情形、適成反比例、據聞日本人亦大批拋出美滙、同時、中國政府銀行對於市塲所拋出之美金、並不踴躍購進、此外、股票之價格因法幣堅俏、又吿跌落、回復上星期之低價、</p>
<p>經濟評論家　深刻之分析</p>
<p>著名經濟評論家阿勒斯、昨日在英文大美晚報、發表一文、評論本市美商銀行停止美元支票存戶一舉云、此間金融界人士、對於美商銀行最近所採之辦法、紛紛加以互相抵觸之評論、此舉無疑爲一極重要之行動、同時對於本市金融界必將發生若干影響、然認此舉係表示上海一般局勢之前瞻、在三數日內即將轉劣、實屬不思之甚、</p>
<p>此舉保障　存戶利益</p>
<p>美商銀行之考慮實行此舉、不自今日始、其動機亦不止一端、最重要者、爲美商銀行計劃予存戶以最大之保障、日美關係緊張以來、已數月於茲、自去歲十月起、上海人士即深恐戰事即將爆發、一旦太平洋戰事眞正爆發、則上海銀行、包括美國銀行、即不能照常執行業務、</p>
<p>改用存摺　另有優點</p>
<p>活期存款之存戶、因執有存款簿、故足以證明其所存之款、多於其所提取者、然支票存戶之情形即不同、彼等並無文件足以證明彼等最边之存款數、因彼等每月接到來往存款報吿一次、而美商銀行又每日用信件將此項來往存款、向本國報吿、熟悉此情形後、即可知美元支票戶若改爲儲蓄戶之優點、</p>
<p>積貯美金　爲數過多</p>
<p>美商銀行所以實行新辦法之另理由、爲彼等深感其所積貯之美金、數目過多、已超出合理之標準、即自營業觀點加以研究、亦非所宜、本市美商銀行父以爲其所積貯之美金、應轉至兩銀行之紐的總行、及美國各處分行、彼等鼓勵直接向美國開美金支票戶、以减輕其負担、美商銀行採取新辦法之另一目的、或在使上海之外滙投機商氣沮、並予中國法幣以新援助、惟美商銀行保證彼等之停止美元支票戶、不能認爲貨幣政策之一種、因法幣存戶之往來、仍繼續不輟、</p>
<h3>市塲濫肆謠言　洋米突破限價　澈查存米重懲投機勿再猶豫</h3>
<p>昨日米市、因投機份子賡續在市塲濫肆謠言、暗盤又生、致最高洋米、已超越每石八十五元之限價、本市民食、復趨嚴重階段、若不一度急予制止、則後患堪虞、茲誌各情於後、</p>
<p>洋米產區　輪運如織</p>
<p>投機份子昨在米市塲所傳播之謠言、不日港米將受禁運、即謂遠東局勢演變與洋米運滬有礙、但按諸實際、則昨日到滬港米、又達一萬二千包、且南洋航運、照常維持、挪輪沙爾及法輪洛司、相繼駛往西貢、而駛往香港之船隻、於今日一日間、計有廣東·蘇州·太原·湖北·明生、等五輪、廣東輪並轉往暹邏、瑯麗輪則定明日駛往仰光、產米區域之航運既屬暢通、則洋米來源、可絕無問題、所謂香港洋米禁止出口之說、亦係捕風捉影之談、且香港僅係洋米轉運口岸、禁運與吾、與本埠米市、無大關礙、因本市米商、儘可向外洋產區直接訂購、但投機份子、因鑒於本埠存米豐厚、與來源之湧旺、米價將逐步下跌、乃故造無稽謠言、以混亂市情、而抬高價格、無非欲遂其牟利之私慾耳、</p>
<p>澈查存米　未容姑息</p>
<p>食米價格過高、居民生計愈益艱難、然米價之節節上升、厥爲投機米蠭操縱壟斷所致、今囤米甚爲充實、來源仍未阻滯、茲望兩租界當局尅日密査米棧存底、如經査出有久囤而無意照限出籠者、即應抄錄其貨主眞實改名、進棧年月、囤米來價、促其即日供應市塲、吾則、沒收充公、供諸平糶、救濟平民、並將調查所得　切囤米數量公諸報端、俾衆知曉、倘含糊其事、任彼順水推舟、米價勢必再漲、限價恐難保持、屆時社會秩序、將何堪設想、聞工部局上星期調査木埠食米、有大量增加、單就荳米業公會之各荳米行食米存底、共計有八十一萬一千零七十六包、比上期父激增十四萬五千力百零三包、此外各米號堆棧及倉庫、亦有大量存底、而一般私人如廠商積存者、爲數亦多、</p>
<h3>局董競選急進　英美候選人月底可選定　日候選人五名下週推出</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海日僑方面昨日起籌備四月二日三日之工部局年選事宜、衆信日方仍將如去年推出五候選人、參加競選、預料日方候選人、將在本星期六日兩天、日居留民團執行委員會改選後、於一星期內正式選出、據悉候選人已達四十二人、其中僅有半數得能正式被選爲執行委員、</p>
<p>英美候選　人將推定</p>
<p>美僑方面、雖已推出兩候選人、但美僑協會昨曾通吿僑民、仍可提出候選人、但限期於本月二十七日一律截止、不再增加、則複選勢將不舉行、而明思德及阿樂滿兩氏即正式爲下屆工部局大選之競選者、負責推定英方候選董事者、爲英僑協會、將於短期內推定候選人、又將決定應付方針、蓋日英聞之競爭、又極劇烈、至候選人數額、將一如往例、共爲五人、但一般預料、現任英董凱自威麥唐納等五人、可望蟬聯、</p>
<p>選舉人册　加速編造</p>
<p>編造選舉人名單一事、規定凡最後確定之選舉人名單中、未列名之個人或商行、槪無投票之權、此項名單可於三月二日以後發表、張貼於江西路二〇九號工部局應接室及各捕房、並將分發各領署外僑機關及俱樂部、凡欲列入及變更地主及地址者、須於三月二日前通知捐務處、過期無效、如對於去年十二月三十一日所發表之預備選舉人名單、發現錯映及遺漏情事、應即向捐務副處長報吿、</p>
<h3>今日新運七週年　偉大紀念</h3>
<p>今日爲新生活運動七週紀念、本市各界民衆、同念七年前將委員長創導新生活運動之動機、厥在刷新民衆生活、剷除腐敗惡習、增强全民體力、共建光榮國家、際此抗建接近勝利階段、更應繼承以往精神、貫澈始終、故均決以堅忍不拔之意旨、遵照禮義廉恥之明訓、作偉大之紀念、</p>
<h3>英美在滬各團體　協助撤僑事宜　兩國僑民均願遵從勸吿　及時撤退藉符政府希望</h3>
<p>英國當局於十六日晚重申撤退勸吿、此項勸吿、最適用於淪陷區內之英僑婦孺、即非淪陷區內之僑民、如自覺無留華之必要而擬撤退者、當局亦極爲贊成、並當予以相當之便利、日來本埠英僑協會·英國婦女協會·退伍軍人會·皇家空軍協會·等英僑團體、皆關懷此事、並力謀與當局合作、爲個人及國家之安全、促進僑民之撤退、雖此僅爲勸吿性質、絕無强制意義、但一般僑民、均能顧念大局、及政府採取警戒措置、防患未然之苦心、亦皆願及時撤退、昨日某英僑女子語記者云、「吾身爲英人、自當遵照政府任何形式之善意勸吿」</p>
<p>平津英僑　來滬集中</p>

<p>柯立芝輪　載僑撤退</p>
<p>據悉、最近由滬駛美者爲該公司最大之柯立芝總統號、預計於本月二十五日由馬尼刺返滬、次日即渡太平洋駛美、該輪原可載客九百名、近因由馬尼刺及上海各地撤退之僑民、爲數極夥、故臨時增加小床、艙位總達一千二百餘、現該輪艙位幾已預售一空、而日本方面之美僑、一部份亦將在橫濱神戶搭該艦返國、</p>

<h3>華樂賭窟稽查　盧鼎遭擊斃命　兇手一名中彈擒獲　流彈誤傷路人兩名　盧於三月前部一度遭狙擊</h3>

<h3>南市大小賭窟　昨突全部停閉　滬西特警成立時嚴禁烟賭</h3>

<p>南市賭塲　全遭封閉</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、已跌破六千元大關、致英矣金鎊各降二元半、英金票呆定如故、市價站定、美金票於午後會退至十六元八角、嗣因紛傳美日形勢較爲緩和、致晚市抬至十七元二角、但比上日仍軋跌一角、香港票供給旺盛、市價步落、日金票跌後回平、晚市仍爲一元七角三分、朝鮮票需要又殷、晚市高至一元三角四分、</p>
<h3>空戶抬頭　金市進六千元關　現貨價仍高出三百元左右</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、跌勢越厲、破進六千元大關後、再入九百八百元兩關、最低竟達五千七百七十五元、故高低差額幾有三百元、賣空抬頭、聲勢浩大、多方雖力搜、奈人心膽怯、買風不易擴展、晨開已撳入六千元內、吿五千九百八十元、但一度提至六千〇七十元、聞係滬西幫等所撈、嗣後一蹶不振、瀉至五千八百六十五元、午收尙吿五千九百〇五元、後市開盤曾達五千九百四十元、而同康永·義元·新大永等聯袂來售、慘落達九千七百七十五元、三點一刻外電傳日方對英美記者談話避免在太平洋加入戰爭、市勢頓被激昂、合盛·新豐·永仁·承永來買、漸見回昂至五千九百九十元、收盤則爲五千九百五十元、比上日軋小一百十元、收後塲外已做六千元、又現貨行市絞期貨仍高三百元左右、成交不多、期貨全大交易的四萬餘兩、掉期二月轉入三月買方貼進最大喊三十元、終爲一十元左右、銀樓飾金兩度小至六百四十元、終爲軋平、關金等平、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市塲興會淋漓　現貨抬於前期貨扳於後　民食乃悉行斲喪於其中</h3>
<p>洋米繼續到滬、大古公司太原輪昨晨抵埠、由香港裝來六千包、又江蘇輪亦於昨午到埠、由海港運來二千九百三十六包、又怡和洋行裕生輪昨日下午四時抵滬亦由香港運來三千二百四十四包、昨日共到洋米一萬二千一百八十包、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨日漲風益厲、蓋客囤實銷盡在投機氣氛籠罩之下、不問供量充實、到頭擁擠、定價通划、只知一味拉進、購進後即可獲利、更不計及他日之反動、而一般操縱者更又趁此機會、盡力宣傳、火藥氣味愈濃、則其鼓勵之力量越足、買氣愈濃、售價益高、現米既拉抬於前、期貨扳俏於後、此吹彼應、越抬越高、現期兩米盡被拉高元外、中决抵達限價綫後、高貨以上又多擯不出樣、因是又傳加價一二元之暗盤曾有發生於場外、雖求證實、而人心益被搖惑、期貨新交易曾有六七起在接洽船隻中、蓋目下匯長定價早已低宜、一有船隻即可大量成交也、回籠期貨允見熱鬧、售開計有二千多噸、價漲五六角至一元不等、開一號西貢路貨及二月份均爲九十七元、二號現貨九十四元、碎米月底期七十五元一角、二月份七十六元、三月份七十六五角、小絞現九十元及九十一元、一月十五日裝船貨及一月份裝船途貨均九十元、二月份自八十七元及八十九元三五角不等、現貨至收市時較軟、但高中混淆、實際上即是抬價、計收盤一號新西貢爲八十五元至八十四元、二號八十元、七十九元、一號暹羅八十五元、决至八十二元半、火紋八十四元、次至八十二元五角、小紋浦東棧七十六元、七十五元八角、　黨米八十六元、米菉七十三元、碎尖六十七元、决至三號碎八十二元八角、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、仍以來源售絕、一些存貨續在奇貨可屑之中、所以貨主遇有問津、喊聲權狂、個有三四元之巨、而作客方面、因乏貨應用、雖力圖貶抑、難於抗持、結果開價、終較前市　提二元有奇、若崑山原白粳售百十元至百零八元、斛見百零六元至百零二一元、靑角薄稻斛見百零一允半一百元、</p>
<p>糯米實銷　續不爽、然一般大戶、仍以糯價獨、廉糧在吸收、售方遂亦扳俏異常、價升元半、開香港特白元八十三元半、普通八十二元、糯菉七十五元七角、七十五元二角、</p>
<h3>廠粉供應　突然停止　大批洋粉月底可到　租界存麥達四十元</h3>
<p>麵粉市况、頗爲緊俏、蓋緣華廠平賣粉、因原料匱乏、突然暫停供應、故人心頓時惶惶、且洋粉新到僅三萬餘包、聞係金龍牌坎拿大粉、不合本客去化、開價亦須二十四元、大批來源、尙須月底可到、更値日美風雲緊迫之秋、執貨者莫不居奇扳俏、而本客囤購者益形活潑、統市售開鐘樓牌澳粉三千餘包、價已升至二十四元九角、路貨喊價已達二十五兀以上、尙有路貨月底交價二十四元七角、均比上日提升四五角、按目下澳美各粉、接踵而至、本市麵粉供給、決無缺乏之虞、惟恐來源隨時中斷、市面前途、均受國際風雲刺激云、</p>
<p>小麥市况、同趨暗俏、蓋以內地來源、幾吿斷絕、滬市存貨、早已枯竭、近因無錫產價、每包已漲起十元之巨、申地現麥、欲購不易得手、洋麥來源、亦以船位缺乏、無從接濟、故人心愈挺、昨市租界存麥竟已喊至四十元大關、由本街交易數十包、日廠進價、仍限原盤、但已無貨可收云、</p>
<h3>油餅　補空翻多　一時並起</h3>
<p>油餅實銷依然呆滯、大局完全受投機左右、故市况千變萬化、昨因隔日收盤雖被壓平、但人心以爲多頭得勢、以致補空翻多、買氣頻高、行情迭漲、最高價豆油曾猛提三四元、豆餅突升三四角、惟收盤略見回小、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗多空　見解不同　雙馬有五六十元起伏</h3>
<p>紗市起伏浩大、且趨勢　忽無定、此因人心恍惚之故、但實際銷路、日漸活動、港幫對於一十支紗需要較爲起色、聞運輸途徑、有拱橋一小碼頭可通、所以同業心思良好、惟投機的人們依然拋賣看小、可想雙方見仁見智、各有不同也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千二百三十三元、低價爲一千一百七十五元、午後始做一千二百零六元、跌至一千一百八十一元、最後價爲一千二百十五元、有人要　、今日有棉紗二百十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後、人氣惡劣、塲中一致賣出、叫喊者甚湧、首盤價爲一千二百零九元、一霎間跌進二百元關內、直瀉至一千一百七十五元、旋後空頭盈利扒補、又復回升、同時香港幫實需有二千包左右、人心重振、直漲至一千二百三十三元、迨至十一時後、聞余價慘落、賣戶又復活躍、再瀉至一千一百八十一元、收盤稍好、至一千一百九十二元、査半日間成交統計九千三百五十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如右香港一、八五五同行七、五〇〇統計九、三五五</p>
<h3>棉市停頓如故</h3>
<p>現棉情况、晤淡如常、大衆因外匯放長、金價起伏不一、心思恍惚、所以生意入於停頓狀態中、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因外商售出而跌、繼之又因同業及現　商購進回漲、結果較上日收盤價格、的漲一二磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、續因賣氣濃厚、各方均有售出而慘跌、昨日連日預測再小三羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以現紗市塲每况愈下、國際間情勢更惑人耳目、是以外棉交易亦一蹶不振、無人過問焉、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市恍惚</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况、空方一面　補、多力一面仍在賣出、做多者以爲權利及利息合息甚高、做空者以爲當此滿　風雨之際、乃更夜長夢多、各有相當理由、故見仁見智多空　在　法、前途　有劇烈之變化、外商銀行漸有　提存款之現象、本埠形勢又見多事、行市幾度上騰，高價繼未能立定、昨日上午行市、開盤即高數角、丙種又衝出四元、信孚怡太仁昌買進、頗昌聯　鴻大賣出、午收即好數角、午後丙種曾高至近五元、比最低價已高過五元、故賣戶又湧起、聯益鴻大繼續賣出、信昌益昌多頭亦有斬割、信孚一方賣出、一方買進、聯和新華胡鶴記中孚等尙在拉抬比上午父好數角、結果再漲八角至一元六角、成交總數的二百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲九十一元半、</p>
<p>衆業股市形勢仍甚恍惚、下午因匯市在鬆、賣風擴大、多種見新低價、收盤空方略有抵補、會德豐慘跌最厲、高價爲八十六元半、收盤小至七十八元半、各股成交極鉅、橡皮投亦被壓低、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布亦大變</h3>
<p>廠布昨市大跌小回、人心恍惚、晨開以棉紗劇瀉各布售盤亦起大變、富貴細布由上日三十八元七角半、在跌至三十六元、富貴斜紋由三十二元五角、跌至三十元零五角、後市回昂五角至一元、結果細布斜紋仍小每疋一元至二元、粗布每疋跌五角之譜、漂染布跌每疋一元左右、本街成交各布二百餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦細布色布等百餘件、閩粤幫辦漂染各布及斜紋一百數十件、北路烟津幫辦粗布色布五六十件、十九日疋頭運香港五百八十五包、</p>

<p>環境——大家的「護身符」，　環境應事；籍環境處事；籍環境行事……豈但「明哲保身」而已，還落得個「冠冕堂皇」。魚與熊掌，兩者兼得，誰又願意再做獃子去「硬挺」？</p>
<p>本來上海是什麽都「流行」得最快的地方：紅襪子變赤足，長旗袍翻短旗袍，「寇丹」從手指喬遷到脚趾……現在「環境一壞」，就無怪要一片環境聲了。</p>
<p>喝香檳，玩女人，爲著「環境」；跑賭塲，逛舞廳，爲着「環境」；囤積，操縱，居奇，也是爲着「環境」……</p>
<p>這原是些「小事情」，「不足計較」的；我們所不能已於言者固別有在。</p>
<p>別的是什麽呢？……（「環境」關係，恕不明言！）</p>
<p>然而不妨說一句大概無涉於「環境」的話：「不耍拿環境當做橡皮膏和麻繩！」</p>
<h3>隨到隨考記</h3>
<p>— 春曉</p>
<p>表弟剛從鄕間來到上海，要想投考學校，原因是在鄉間不能安心讀書。他在上海沒有別的親戚朋友，有的也不會懂得怎樣投考，那祇有我暫充一個全權代表了。</p>
<p>但是他來得太晚了一點，差不多的學校，都已招考過，而且也有已經開始正式上課。翻開報紙來看，在那裏還刋着幾家招生的廣吿，並且還說是隨到隨考，這好像是學校裹專爲遠道而來的學生所設想，還不是表弟的運氣？</p>
<p>與冲冲趕到一家學校，向門房要了一份章程，看看上而要考的功課都很容易，學費到並不十分便宜，但爲了離家較近，就報了名，隨便問了一聲：「有證件可否免試？」</p>
<p>「那不行，我們這裹有證件與沒有證件都須經過入學考試，以免日後程度參差不齊。」不知稱他什麽職務好的一位先生說。我想，「好在任何地方的學校敎管，總比上海來得强，表弟也不會應付不了的。」</p>
<p>第二天早上陪了表弟去考，先到敎務處，出示准考證，領了試卷題目，由一茶房導至考塲，那考塲裏已有許多人先我們在了。我起初還以爲都是投考的學生，豈知道完全是「陪考』的人，數一數數目，實際的學生，連我們祗有六位，監考先生不知道是那一位，大家都不知道。</p>
<p>他們眞够聰明，一個人考試，來了四五個，譬如考央文時，由英文好的人幫忙；考算術時，由算術好的人幫忙；眞是人才濟濟，考取自在意料之中，也可以說是他們總動員的結果吧。</p>
<p>有一位大的還嫌同在一處，耳目衆多，總有點不便的地方，不能爽爽快快「派司」，竟將卷子排在袖筒裹到外面去了，其實何必多此一舉，彼此同「道」，大家心照不宣就得了。</p>
<p>沒有陪考的頂晦氣，考不出的時候，祇有咬咬筆桿，擦擦橡皮，口瞪目呆，想人家派司點給他，但是啥人理會他呢。幸而他靈機一動，把別人的卷子拉到自己的面前，開始作「滕文公」了。</p>
<p>本來中學入學考試，應理要一天功夫，備有午飯，現在隨到隨考，考試完畢卽算了事，二塊錢報名費，便宜嗎，還算貴呢？</p>
<p>考試完畢時候還早，就在校裏兜了一個圈子，碰見了表弟的同學來繳費，說他裏面有人介紹，不經過入學考試的。</p>
<p>緩步出得校門來時，很巧的又遇見我的老同學，寒喧之後，知道他就在那學校裹任事，於是我將表弟的事拜託他。他拍拍我的肩笑道：「你眞太老實了，上海的事情，那一件不是這樣，入學考試算得什麽，還不是裝裝幌子，騙騙呆子而已。陌生人前面，誰肯把自己的西洋鏡拆穿，大家都是自已人，肚裏明白就是了。你如不信，明天看榜便知分曉，明天見，明天見。」說完他便進校門去了。</p>
<p>明天，一早跑去一看，果然榜上都有人名，個個不落空。原來隨到隨考是這麽一會事，可惜我的表弟祇有在那裏委屈一學期了！</p>

<p>其次她父想到一個同學的好意，想把她介紹給她哥哥，答應把資助升學和負担一家生活做條件，在那個時候，她覺得眞是一個很重大的侮辱，至少限度，也是一個滑糟的笑話。但現在看看家裏的情况，以及父親和母親的痛苦，她不禁略略有些後悔了。女人本來是要出嫁的，如果能够因爲自己的出嫁而有益全家的人，那末即使帶一些被動性質，實在也沒有咀咒的理由。</p>
<p>「哥哥的病現在不趕快治好，以後便沒有希望了！」母親的話，不斷的在她耳朶邊響着。</p>
<p>哥哥是父親的獨生子，也是她從小到現在所有的一個最好的伴侶；他上杭州養病去的」天，湘綺爲着他足足哭了三四個鐘頭，連夜飯也沒有吃。這樣一個僅有的同胞，如果眞讓他一去不回的話，她心坎上一定要有一條永遠不能塡平的創痕了！</p>
<p>「但願侯校長能够給自己找一個位置，那末就可預支半年的薪水，寄給哥哥去做醫藥費了…。不知道爸爸今天談得怎麽樣…？」湘綺的心裏不停的這樣想。</p>
<p>爸爸終於回來了，滿頭大汗，顯得很興奮的樣子；但興奮之中，却又帶着一些很奇特的神氣。</p>
<p>「爸爸，校長給我找到了事情沒有？」羅老先生沒有走進屋子她已來不及的詢問着，可是詫異得很，她連問了三句，爸爸還是沒有回答。最後才含糊其詞的說;</p>
<p>「停一會再吿訴你！」</p>
<p>接着，羅老先生便借了一個緣故，把湘綺支回她自己的屋子去，然後像商量軍國大計一樣的和他夫人密談起來。　（三四）</p>

<h3>小菜塲內</h3>
<p>— 芒背</p>
<p>天飄着濛兩，　候又轉冷了。</p>
<p>素來是個無事忙的我，大淸早就踏着泥濘的石板路到後門的「野鷄小菜塲」去，目的是想搨點「便宜貨」。</p>
<p>小菜塲的人聲不會因了天色的陰鬱而輕寂一些；相反地，雨天的吵雜分外擾動。</p>
<p>「强盜！捉强盜！」突然一聲尖銳而急遽的婦人呼叫在不遠的地方冲破喧嘩！</p>
<p>於是，人們都把驚恐的眼光投過去，這眼光中是祇少帶着點「幸災樂禍」的。</p>
<p>順着聲音望去，一個十三四歲的「小癟三」正向這兒在奔過來，嘴裏還小斷地在哨嚼着大餅油條……</p>
<p>「原來是這末一回事！」</p>
<p>像看見其他極平淡的事情一樣，誰的臉上都堆着平和的微笑，甚至有些人還投給「小癟三」以一瞥同情的眼光！</p>
<p>「這種年頭，東西那麽貴，沒有吃，難道等死不成？餓極了自然要搶！」一個似乎「老於世故」的中年人這木咕噥</p>
<p>市聲又筏喧囂起來……</p>
<p>濺着泥水，我徜徉着……在一個牛肉攤旁站住了。</p>
<p>一元三角一磅。上了年紀的老太太正在數着找回的零錢；菜籃裏面躺着一大塊鮮紅的牛肉。菜籃掛在臂上……</p>
<p>突然，我被一個站在她後面的人（大的也是「癟三」）的鬼鬼祟祟底一神情吸引住了。果然不出所料，像貓捉耗子，幾秒鐘內那塊牛肉就到了他的手裏，跑了！</p>
<p>我沒有喊；因爲這是「別人家的事」。而且，買得起牛肉偷了又算得什麽？</p>
<p>可是爲了「避嫌疑」，我也就一溜了之。</p>
<p>再往下走，全是蔬菜之類……爭執又起。</p>
<p>「靑菜！一毛半一斤？我可從來沒有吃過！」</p>
<p>眞的，就是聽也沒有聽過</p>
<p>「你知道現在米賣多少錢一石。」</p>
<p>也不錯，米價超出了一百元！</p>
<p>「哼！米貴，菜就格外應該便宜。」</p>
<p>我不知道這是什麽理由；但是想想倒也很對。</p>
<p>「菜便宜，我們就不要吃飯了嗎？」</p>
<p>都對！可是我沒有揷嘴；因爲這又是「別人家的事」。</p>
<p>徜徉……雨滴大起來了。結果是一點「便宜」也沒有搨到！</p>
<p>買菜的都忽促地踏上歸途：有的籃裹是魚，是肉，手裏還提着一隻雞；有的籃裹却祇孤另另地躺着一束「雪裏紅」！</p>
<p>小菜塲——都市的縮影啊！</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>「偷香聖手」</h3>
<p>— 鄧士英</p>
<p>去年，好萊塢曾經、窩風的攝製過大量的所謂「風流喜劇」，在我們已經看過而且還記得起來的，有「多夫寳鑑」，「多妻秘史」等等。現在大華公映的「偷香聖手」，也便是屬於這一類。</p>
<p>「偷香聖手」的攝製時間大抵是也在這「一窩風」中的，不過其成績則遠不如「多夫寳鑑」。這一類所謂「風流喜劇」，「意識」也者是談不到，也許我們去看本來就根本沒有存道麽一條心，祇是消磨兩小時而已。——那麽，「偷香聖手」又如何呢？</p>
<p>從「演員表」夾看，這是茂娜洛埃和茂文陶格拉斯的「初度合作」，茂娜洛埃是威廉鮑威爾的「老搭擋」，對於演喜劇就不說是「拿手」罷，也至少可以說得上是「經騐豐富」；陶格拉斯呢，他近來在中國觀衆問似相當走紅，上面提起的「多夫寳鑑」，便有他的份。</p>
<p>可是他們倆「初次合作」的「偷香聖手」却並不叫人滿意，這，責仟不該由他們倆負，多半的原因還在於劇本和導演。</p>
<p>我不是說這支「風流喜劇」的劇情太「弄假成眞」得「隨心所欲」，因爲這原是美國喜劇的「一貫作風」，不如此，是無從「喜」起的；你如果要從這上面想滿足，那是你自己的希望太高了，而且，也有失你「消磨時光」的本意。你所不能滿意的，也許是在這支「風流喜劇」之「喜」是大牛在對白上而不够「形象化」，所以你就覺得不够勁了。當然，你如果對對白部份有較多的理解，那你就會比較的歡喜它。</p>
<p>導演之沒有把戲展開，使之「喜」氣揚溢，那也許是由於劇本的限制，然而旋律之不够明快，高潮之不够强固（就是最後捷夫回鄕，瑪態度轉變那塲戲吧）那還是由於導演之故。在最近大華接連公映的他的三張片子中，（「新月」，「屛開雀選」和這張「偷杳聖手」都出於同一導演之手。）最好的一張應該是「屛開雀選」，我覺得他導演這路戲比較合他的手法一點。</p>

<h3>Japan's Southward Ambitions Remain Unchecked; US Prepares to Send Fleet to Far East: The So-Called New Order Runs Counter to US Policy; British, American, Australian, and Dutch Cooperation Sufficient to Shatter Japan's Delusions</h3>
<p>Washington: US Undersecretary of State Welles, when asked about reports that the US plans to move its fleet to the Philippines if Japan proceeds with its southward advance, declined to comment, saying only that such questions should be directed to the Navy Department. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to several newspapers here today, Washington officials are now considering not the European war, but the possibility of the US fleet appearing in the Far East to deter Japanese aggression. The "Washington Times" and the "Herald" both report that President Roosevelt is prepared to order the fleet to the Far East should Japan attack Singapore or attempt to occupy the Dutch East Indies. The tension in the Far East has relegated news of Germany's invasion of Britain to a less prominent position. Editorials also express the seriousness of the war spreading to the East. Although the outbreak of war seems to have been delayed, the crisis still exists and will continue to exist as long as the fundamental conflict of interests between Japan and the Western powers is not resolved.</p>
<p>The "Washington Star" commented on the situation in detail, stating that British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, said that the goal is to maintain the situation and prevent it from collapsing completely. But if Japan maintains its aggressive policies, which are detrimental to powers with firm stances, how can this goal be achieved? Unless one side concedes, conflict cannot be avoided. Currently, there are no signs of concession from either side, and the situation is undoubtedly extremely serious. No foreign ambassador has faced such a serious situation upon taking office in Washington as Ambassador Nomura does today. Does Nomura also realize this? US-Japan relations have become strained due to Japan's three-and-a-half-year attempt to conquer China, and further deteriorated due to Japan's open affiliation with the Axis powers and its desire to exploit the Tripartite Pact to advance its so-called "New Order." If Nomura comes to the US to promote a "New Order," he cannot hope to gain American sympathy, as Japan's aggressive policies are diametrically opposed to the principles upheld by the US. These principles include China's right to manage its own affairs, and the sacred right of equal opportunity, previously guaranteed by Japanese commitments and treaties. Japan must understand that only facts, not empty promises, can improve its relationship with the US.</p>
<p>The "Washington Post" also published an editorial stating that the Secretary of State's talks with the British, Australian, and Dutch ambassadors should serve as a warning to Japan, and make it realize that its dream of establishing an empire in Southeast Asia will be shattered. The alignment of interests expressed by the US, Britain, and the Netherlands will inevitably lead to unified action, the possibility of which is not welcome to Japan. The fact that Tokyo expressed great alarm at the end of this week is significant. Although the sudden specter of war with the US has crystallized anti-southward advance sentiment among the Japanese people, their desire for peace with the US is unreliable because the power to decide war or peace with the US does not rest with the Japanese people, but with the Japanese military clique. The only thing that can make the Japanese military hesitate is the reality that aggression in Southeast Asia will inevitably provoke strong resistance from all countries concerned. The US, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands should quickly reach a complete understanding to determine how to respond to Japan's southward advance threat. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese War Related to Overall Situation: US Should Fully Support China; US Government Official Broadcasts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Washington: Federal Security Administrator McNutt (former Governor-General of the Philippines) stated in a broadcast yesterday that the Sino-Japanese War has become a "preliminary action" for the defense of the Philippines' outer perimeter. McNutt stated that, given the nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, China's victory is "inseparable from our hope for peace." He urged further economic aid to China to strengthen the US's own outer defense line. Colonel Roosevelt and author Chamberlain also broadcasted messages. During the broadcast, McNutt expressed regret that the Philippines had not yet been armed, while Colonel Roosevelt called on the government to declare its Far East policy. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>After a slight easing of the situation in Chongqing, the British suddenly advised their nationals to withdraw from the Japanese-occupied areas of China, without making any distinctions, and also laid mines near Singapore, which is quite unexpected. Although the situation remains serious, it is not too bold to speculate that Japan will not take irreparable actions before Germany achieves significant victories over the British Isles. In short, China does not fear any losses from Japan's various adventurous actions and is now quietly waiting for opportunities to respond to changes. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Business Negotiations Reopen</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations, which had been suspended since April last year, officially reopened yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, Miyakawa, Chairman of the Soviet Foreign Trade Committee, Mikoyan, and Deputy Chairman Gaonovitz, held talks for an hour and a half. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet-Japanese business negotiations reopened here yesterday as a result of long-term efforts by Japanese diplomatic representative Tatekawa and others. Tatekawa submitted a plan for the exchange of goods, which the Soviet government will respond to tomorrow. The Japanese side here is very optimistic about the progress of the meeting. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Even Declares: Relying on Military Force as a Backing for Diplomacy; Aiming to Realize the Co-Prosperity Sphere Program</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, speaking before the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, strongly urged the Japanese people to demonstrate their determination to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and rebuked those within Japan who oppose the Tripartite Pact and those who belittle this determination and consider its declaration to be empty threats. Matsuoka also refuted the notion that Japan is exhausted from the war against China, and said that if the Japanese people do not express this determination abroad, he will not be able to conduct strong diplomacy. He is making every effort to use all peaceful means while preparing for the worst-case scenario, and the foundation of peaceful means is the establishment of a perfect national defense system. Diplomacy is ultimately military force, and diplomacy cannot achieve anything without military backing. The establishment of the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is our belief, and we will never give it up no matter what. The entire Japanese nation should resolutely hold this belief, which is not based on empty hopes, but on the national strength to realize this great cause. This is the foundation of the diplomacy upon which the "Co-Prosperity Sphere Program" is based. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Ultimately Unable to Conceal Fear: Accuses Britain of Creating Crisis in the Far East; Singapore Completes Defense Preparations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: This morning's editorial in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan is still calm as the midnight sea, but Britain is loudly clamoring about the seriousness of the Far East situation. The reason for this is puzzling. London has repeatedly warned that war in the Far East is about to break out, and Washington has reported that the US, Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands are holding a joint Pacific defense conference. Although the contents of the meeting are unknown, it can be imagined that they are discussing concrete measures to deal with a Pacific war. The Singapore area is a major international trade route, and now Britain has laid mines here. Who, then, is responsible for creating the crisis in the Far East? (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the laying of mines near Singapore is sufficient to hinder Japanese shipping, and the impact on Japanese routes to India and Africa is particularly significant. Moreover, the area of these mines may be expanded, which can be regarded as a measure to blockade Japan. The "Hochi Shimbun" stated that Britain's defense preparations in Malaya should be regarded as a provocative act. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that Ota, an employee of Mitsui &amp; Co., has returned from Singapore. According to his account, the British authorities in Singapore are managing Japanese residents in an increasingly strict manner. Mines have been laid around the port, and forts and bunkers have been built along the coast. Each time troops are transferred, there is a blackout exercise for three or four days. After Japanese residents leave, they are not allowed to return. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated today that Japan is willing to hold a world conference to end the current war. The newspaper criticizes Britain and the US for their unwarranted fear of the situation in the Far East and said that if the world's powers could come together, they would be able to solve all kinds of difficulties. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Philippines Determined to Resist Aggression; Governor of Burma Expresses: Sufficient Strength to Deal with Incidents</h3>
<p>Washington: Eliserte, a Philippine expert in Washington, told a United Press reporter today that the Philippines will exhaust all of its resources to resist the Axis powers' New Order. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rangoon: Governor of Burma, Cochrane, stated in a speech today that Burma is confident that its own preparations, backed by the power of the Empire, are sufficient to deal with any attack. An attack on Burma would be an attack on the Empire, its full strength, and its allies. We in Burma are currently contributing to increasing the Empire's manpower. This work is quite significant, and progress has been made. The date of completion is not far off, which is something I find deeply gratifying. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Manchuria Implements Conscription System</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Army Minister Lieutenant General Tojo announced to the Diet today that "Manchukuo" has implemented a national conscription system. The country's newly established military schools are developing rapidly, but the country's army is still unable to break away from Japan's leadership and become independent.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Explosive Factors in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Japan has now become the only disturbing factor in the Pacific, drawing global attention. However, according to Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's explanation in Parliament the day before yesterday, this phenomenon is due to "excessive fear of Japan by the relevant powers; " and the source of this fear is entirely due to Britain "spreading false information, saying that Japan is preparing to advance south immediately." Therefore, he went on to advise the powers not to "overly fear" Japan, because Japan's southward advance emphasizes peaceful means, not the use of force, so as not to bring self-destruction, and so on. According to the London Sunday Times of the 16th, what Britain is currently most worried about is Japan being driven by Germany to form a strategic wing of the German-Italian-Japanese group, just like Italy did in the Mediterranean last year, and soon set off huge waves in the Pacific, coordinating with Germany's spring offensive, attacking Britain and the United States, in an attempt to reverse the common decline of this group. The newspaper then issued a warning: "If Japan wants to imitate Mussolini, it is best to carefully consider its own future destiny!" Therefore, the unrest caused by the Japanese factor in the Pacific today can actually be analyzed into three points: First, it is not because it immediately and actively attacks south, but because the German-Italian-Japanese group has become an unstoppable force, and it has no choice but to be carried along. Second, it is not because it has sufficient military resources and leisure to take risks while waging war against China, but because it has to make the greatest struggle to save its own and its allies' fundamental defeat. Third, the powers are not currently "afraid" of Japan, but merely worry about the further disruption of the entire Pacific situation caused by it.</p>
<p>From the first point of view, within the German-Italian-Japanese group, Germany undoubtedly occupies the leading position in terms of strength. Italy has long been unable to resist because of its geographical location directly under Germany's sphere of influence; even Japan in the Far East has to gradually follow Germany's lead; this is a natural law, the weak will eventually follow the strong. Moreover, since the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, the resources and markets of Britain, the United States and their colonies have mostly been blockaded against Japan; in the future, what it relies on, apart from raw materials, a part of which can be obtained from the Dutch East Indies, the rest of what it needs, assuming that Germany and Italy can find a way to supply, can only be maintained through land through the Soviet Union and the European continent. However, Germany and Italy can only supply very little, so Japan will eventually be unable to resist the economic pressure and naval blockade of Britain and the United States very quickly. Even in terms of Soviet-Japanese relations, Japan's only reliance now is Germany's mediation with the Soviet Union; recently, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations, attempting to ease the tension between Japan and the Soviet Union through Germany, in order to eliminate worries for the future and concentrate on advancing south; if this move does not succeed, then Japan still needs Germany to contain the Soviet Union from the west. Therefore, in terms of the situation, Japan is now absolutely unable not to closely follow Germany and Italy. London and Washington have recently telegraphed repeatedly that Hitler is exerting pressure, forcing Japan to attack British Far Eastern territories, coordinating with his own large-scale offensive, in order to disperse the strength and attention of Britain and the United States. What the powers are most worried about at the moment is mainly this, and not simply afraid of Japan taking risks automatically.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's "southward advance" has been a dream for many years. Before the outbreak of this European war, its greatest obstacle was the strict surveillance of European powers and the United States, which forced it to put it aside and first take risks against China. With the outbreak of the European war, it thought a great opportunity had arrived; but after self-reflection, it also realized that in the long-term war with China, its national strength had been greatly weakened, and all southward advance demands had become empty threats, with no strength to back them up. For example, last year's demands on Vietnam, although France had already been defeated at the time, openly resisted them, and the final acceptance was due to Germany's exertion of pressure after Japan joined the Tripartite Pact. For another example, Japan's current raw material panic has greatly increased its dependence on the Dutch East Indies. Thinking for it, it absolutely does not want war to break out in this area, leading to damage to materials. What Vice Minister Ohashi said is indeed from the heart. Therefore, in terms of national strength, Japan is currently only weakening day by day, and has never improved since any time after the outbreak of the European war, so why is the Pacific particularly tense now? The most important source of this is that Germany, Italy, and Japan, aiming at the United States' greatest possible assistance to various democracies, have no choice but to hope to defeat the various democracies first. Japan certainly has no choice but to start taking action in the East, but even thinking for itself, with US-Japan relations having completely no hope of improvement today, even if it dares not directly attack the United States, it is bound to attempt to preemptively cut off China's southwestern international transportation routes, so that all material assistance based on the "Lease-Lend Act" will not be able to reach China in the future. The best way to realize this attempt is, of course, to invade Thailand and threaten British Burma and India: thus stirring up the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, taking it as an opportunity to take advantage of. However, the attitude of Thailand in the end, and whether Thailand can refuse when Japan makes a request, are still questions. And once Japan rashly invades Thailand, and Britain and the United States react immediately, then the entire Pacific will immediately be engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Third, thinking for Germany and Italy, it is best for Japan to attack the British and American colonies; for Japan's own war against China, it should of course focus on the southwest of Asia. But no matter what, it has no way to directly attack the United States or attack the heart of Britain. At the same time, the fatal parts of Japan's own core are exposed to the possible attacks of the joint British and American naval and air forces. And in terms of the comparison of military strength, the combined naval, land, and air forces of China, Britain, and the United States can certainly hold a winning ticket against Japan, there is no doubt about this. So if someone is "afraid" of launching a large-scale war in the Pacific, then rather than saying it is Britain and the United States, it is better to say it is Japan itself. However, Britain and the United States are unwilling to see another war in the Pacific within the realm of possibility, so they certainly will not take action first; but if Japan takes action first, then the war cannot be delayed or avoided. Will war break out in the Pacific? Will it not break out? Everything hinges on Japan's future actions?</p>
<h3>Sino-US Stabilization Fund Agreement to be Signed Soon: Legal Tender Credit to be Further Consolidated; Currie to Fly to Chengdu Today: Inspection in Chongqing Comes to an End</h3>
<p>Washington: Officials formally announced that the Sino-US Stabilization Fund Agreement is still under negotiation and will be concluded soon. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Sino-US loan and stabilization fund were handled by Song Ziwen and Hu Shi. President Roosevelt first announced a loan of US$50 million to China last year, and later approved the official advance of US$50 million for the stabilization fund. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau immediately began meeting with key figures in the House and Senate to obtain their approval. Financial experts have been continuously researching the stabilization issue, believing that it can greatly restore the Chinese people's confidence in the legal tender and eliminate speculation in foreign exchange. Officials have also stated that new loans to China can enable China to purchase materials without using foreign exchange. Presidential advisor Dr. Currie is an economic expert and is currently in Chongqing studying China's economic and financial problems. (United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Currie, Tibor Reese, and other members of the US economic delegation, who were scheduled to fly to Chengdu this morning, were unable to depart due to bad weather, as the plane they intended to take was grounded in Chengdu. They are expected to depart tomorrow instead. US Ambassador Johnson, Deputy Naval Attaché Major Burke, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo, and Deputy Minister of Propaganda Dong Xian Guang will also travel with them. They will stay in Chengdu for one or two days before returning to Chongqing. The members of the US economic delegation are scheduled to return to Washington around March 1. It is expected that the delegation will depart for Hong Kong immediately after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu. It is reported that during their stay in Chongqing, the US economic delegation studied more than 20 kinds of materials provided by various Chinese government organizations regarding economy, finance, currency, prices, food, transportation, and production. The delegation's talks with the Chinese authorities began on February 10 and ended yesterday. Chairman Lin hosted Currie, Tibor Reese, and outgoing Ambassador Johnson yesterday afternoon. The Sino-American Cultural Association is scheduled to host a banquet for the US economic delegation on February 20. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Seventh Anniversary of the New Life Movement: President Chiang's Broadcast Speech: Reviewing the Achievements of Past New Life Movement Work; Indicating the Key Points and Significance of Future Promotion</h3>
<p>Chongqing: President Chiang of the New Life Movement Promotion Association delivered a radio speech to compatriots at home and abroad at 8 p.m. on the 18th, the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. The main points are as follows: Compatriots across the country, as we enter the fifth year of our sacred War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we also encounter the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. The main purpose of the New Life Movement is to "know shame and teach war." The intention of the New Life Movement is to create a wartime life for our people that is able to endure hardship and pain, is not afraid of hunger and cold, is not afraid of violence, is disciplined and solemn, and is diligent and thrifty, so that our</p>
<p>entire nation</p>
<p>can strive and sacrifice in the era of survival of the fittest, and seek progress and development, so that our country can obtain permanent independence and freedom. Our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has become stronger as we fight. In fact, although the effect of the New Life Movement in the past seven years has been significant, what should we do today and in the future to make persistent efforts and strengthen ourselves to complete the victory of revenge and reach</p>
<p>national reconstruction success.</p>
<p>This task is of paramount importance. Therefore, on this anniversary, I must conduct a review of the achievements of past New Life Movement work and earnestly explain to all my compatriots the key points and significance of promoting the New Life Movement in the future, and urge the reflection and self-awareness of the military and civilians across the country. Since I launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, it has been seven years to this day. During these</p>
<p>seven years,</p>
<p>our country's politics, military affairs, economy, education, and other aspects have gradually transformed and improved. Many of these steps have been influenced by the New Life Movement, although it is invisible, it is actually very profound. Before the New Life Movement was launched in the 23rd year, the unification of our country had not been fully realized, and local autonomy had no foundation. In the military, the spirit of combat was still lacking training, and civilian organizations could not keep pace with</p>
<p>wartime needs. In the economy, national industries were immature, and national production was insufficient. In education, thoughts were mixed, and educators rarely understood the importance of personality guidance and enhancing national spirit. Our entire life was filled with old habits such as corruption, extravagance, cowardice, and procrastination, and there was no new atmosphere of national reconstruction that was noble, simple, courageous, and lively. Now, we dare not be complacent or complacent, nor do we deny that the elimination of evil</p>
<p>is not yet complete. However, all aspects of our national, social, and personal lives are different from the past. Our country has achieved true unification, and our politics, under this unified leadership, are moving towards improving efficiency. Our military and civilians have a strong and courageous fighting spirit and a disciplined and solemn fighting discipline. Whether it is the front line or the rear, men, women, old, and young,</p>
<p>are united, fighting bravely and unyielding under the sacred will of resisting the enemy and defending the country. Our economy has a continuous supply of new and reconstructed construction, and the combination of national enterprises and private production is even more active. Our education has been extended to the guidance of morality and personality and the enhancement of national spirit. Our society has produced many new spirits that meet the</p>
<p>standards of the New Life Movement. Especially, the thoughts of our people have been able to eliminate many mixed and confusing concepts and shallow and complicated psychology. All patriotic compatriots have unanimously accepted the Three People's Principles as the highest principles of national founding, becoming our common belief. (To be continued) (Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Notifies Provinces to Crack Down on Hoarding</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Upon investigation, the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" have been formally promulgated and implemented by the National Government on February 3rd. As reported in previous editions, these measures are closely related to stabilizing commodity prices. Therefore, the focus of enforcement should be on encouraging merchants to release goods to the market and maintain the legitimate operations of merchants, thereby ensuring smooth circulation of goods and balancing supply and demand, to achieve the fundamental goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Since the new law is just beginning to be implemented, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that the competent authorities may not fully understand the original intent of the legislation and various procedures. Therefore, it has specifically listed the matters that should be noted in the enforcement crackdown and telegraphed them to the provincial and municipal governments yesterday, instructing them to strictly comply.

In addition, motors and ventilators will be installed in the large tunnels, and the original hand-cranked ventilators will be installed in other larger public air-raid shelters. The Air Defense Command has also established a method for temporary storage of belongings. Residents can place boxes and trunks at designated locations marked with a red ball, and they will be transported into the air-raid shelter. After the air-raid alarm is lifted, they can be retrieved. This will greatly contribute to preserving the belongings of the general public and alleviate the congestion during air-raid alarms. (Havas News Agency report from the 18th)</p>

<p>Washington: Yesterday, when the Senate began debating the Lend-Lease Act to aid democratic countries, a fierce debate arose over whether the United States should enter the war. Democratic leader and Senator from Kentucky, Barkley, opened the meeting with a request for the speedy passage of the bill. Former Republican presidential supporter and Senator Taft strongly opposed the bill, calling Barkley's request "a powerful excuse for war." Barkley denied Taft's interpretation, saying, "I am not in favor of war. I oppose the United States entering the war and want to defeat Hitler overseas by helping England so that we do not have to fight here." Barkley continued, "Upon reaching the bridgehead, it will be necessary to cross the bridge, but at present, I do not wish to endorse the war. As to whether this time will necessarily come, I cannot know in advance." Prominent Republican Senator from Vermont, Austin, also exclaimed, "The world is facing a war that is even worse, a slavery that is worse than death. When the time for us to fight arrives, we must fight!"</p>
<p>After the debate ended, Barkley stated that he was confident that the bill would pass within two weeks by approximately seventy votes to twenty-five. (International News Service report from the 18th)</p>
<h3>China and Singapore Discuss Exchange Rate Issues</h3>

<h3>Turkey and Bulgaria Sign Non-Aggression Pact; Both Countries Declare Maintenance of Friendly Relations to Prevent War from Spreading to the Balkans</h3>
<p>London: Radio Rome claimed that Turkey and Bulgaria signed a non-aggression pact yesterday afternoon at the Turkish Foreign Ministry. The Turkish representative was Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu, and the Bulgarian representative was the Bulgarian envoy to Turkey. According to a joint statement issued by the Turkish and Bulgarian governments, the two sides concluded this treaty after a renewed exchange of views on the situation. It is divided into the following four points: (1) Turkey and Bulgaria recognize the non-use of any aggression as the immutable basis of their foreign policy; (2) Moved by the spirit of mutual friendship, the two governments are determined to maintain and develop their confidence in good-neighborly relations; (3) The two governments declare their readiness to seek appropriate means to develop trade relations between the two countries to the greatest extent suitable to the economic structures of both countries; (4) The two governments hope that the newspapers of both countries will be motivated by the mutual friendship and confidence reaffirmed in this declaration to express their opinions. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Vichy: After the joint declaration issued by the governments of Bulgaria and Turkey today, observers here believe that this is another new factor in preserving peace in the Balkan Peninsula. The issuance of this declaration, following the important military talks between the staff officers of the British and Turkish armed forces, is of particular significance. Since the outbreak of the current European war, Turkey and Bulgaria have not been able to trust each other without reservation, and have therefore repeatedly taken military measures on their respective sides of the border. Turkish President İsmet also visited the Dardanelles area to inspect defenses. Regarding Bulgaria's request for an outlet on the Aegean Sea, namely the "Alexandroupolis Port issue," Turkey has consistently supported Greece and expressed its opposition. Given the past state of relations between the two countries, the fact that they were able to issue a joint communiqué this time, reaffirming friendship, could prevent Bulgaria from taking any action against Greece using the Italian-Greek war. At the same time, it is rumored in the Bulgarian capital that important figures in the country will soon follow the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia to Berlin. In recent days, rumors about the situation in the Balkan Peninsula have been rife, causing great anxiety in all quarters. However, after hearing the aforementioned news, it should be possible to feel relieved. (Havas News Agency report from the 17th)</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Issues Statement: Anglo-Turkish Treaty Still Valid</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu commented last night on the recently signed Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, stating, "A very small cause may sometimes have a major effect. This very small document may prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans." Authoritative sources here said last night that the Anglo-Turkish military treaty remains valid, as this new pact states that it does not affect obligations to other countries. (International News Service report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov issued a statement last night, stating that after an exchange of views between Turkey and Bulgaria, the Turco-Bulgarian Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty has been signed, and Turco-Bulgarian relations will become even more consolidated. This treaty is also a testament to the desire of both countries to maintain peace and mutual respect. (Haitong News Agency report from the 18th)</p>
<p>New York: Regarding the signing of the non-aggression pact between Bulgaria and Turkey, political figures here admit that it is a political event that is unfavorable to Britain. Newspapers pointed out that when Turkey and Bulgaria were conducting negotiations, London was deeply uneasy and had instructed its ambassador to Turkey, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, to strongly advise the Turkish government, attempting to obstruct it. Therefore, Hugessen was extremely active in Ankara, the Turkish capital, in the middle of last week. (Haitong News Agency report from the 18th)</p>
<p>London: Responsible figures here made the following comments today on the Turco-Bulgarian agreement: To understand the true nature of the Turco-Bulgarian agreement, we should recall that these negotiations were initiated by Turkey in an attempt to unite the Balkans, which Britain greatly approved of, as Britain has repeatedly stated that the unity of the Balkans is the best way to counter the threat of Nazi aggression. After German forces infiltrated Bulgaria, the value of this agreement was greatly diminished. Under the current circumstances, we cannot be without doubt as to Bulgaria's ability to maintain its neutrality. As for Turkey, it has consistently informed Britain of the progress of the negotiations. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>
<p>London: The News Chronicle published an article by Bartlett, stating that the timely conclusion of the agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria will provide the Nazis with an opportunity for propaganda. The Nazis are now fully exploiting this kind of propaganda. Therefore, it is particularly important that Turkey has clearly stated that the agreement does not affect its obligations to Britain. The Turkish army does not want to enter Bulgaria to resist the German army in that country, but will station troops in places of its own choosing to protect its national interests. This has long been clear, so the new agreement has not in fact changed the existing situation. I believe that the negotiations for the agreement were initiated by Turkey. At that time, the Turks seemed to think that it might encourage the Bulgarians to stop the entry of German troops. However, the times changed faster than the negotiations. Although the environment has changed, if the Bulgarians had refused to negotiate, it would have increased the panic among certain parties in Bulgaria that Turkey would launch a preemptive attack. In one clause of the agreement, Turkey stated its close understanding with Britain. London has expressed full satisfaction with this, which must be reiterated. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>
<p>London: According to British envoy to Bulgaria Rendel, Britain's policy is aimed at maintaining Bulgaria's neutrality and independence and preventing the spread of war to Bulgaria. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Diplomatic circles here today believe that after the signing of the Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact, Greece will not succumb to a peace manipulated by the Axis powers, and will soon suffer a German group invasion through Bulgaria. At the same time, it is generally believed that the Turco-Bulgarian agreement can eliminate the possibility of a German attack on the Dardanelles. People here believe that the Soviet Union has taken on the task of guaranteeing the Bulgarians under the agreement, assuming the position of protector of Turkey that Britain held in the past. British envoy to Bulgaria Rendel issued a warning today that Britain will be prepared to deal with any eventuality. "We do not want to violate Bulgaria's neutrality first, but if the war spreads to Bulgaria, the first to arrive will be Germany." (International News Service report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The sudden signing of the Turco-Bulgarian non-aggression pact yesterday clearly eliminated the last obstacle for Hitler to pass through Bulgaria to Salonica, unless Greece immediately submits to Axis-controlled peace. This significant treaty was signed yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in Ankara, the Turkish capital, largely due to secret mediation by the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union has obtained a promise from Germany to Turkey not to attack, and that the Soviet Union has notified Bulgaria that if King Boris of Bulgaria decides to resist German action, Bulgaria should not expect aid from Soviet Russia. Although the non-aggression pact stipulates that Turco-Bulgarian current obligations to other countries are not changed, it is generally believed that this agreement is a fatal blow to the Anglo-Turkish military alliance, as this move will deprive Britain of its last ally in the southeast. It is expected that Bulgaria and Hungary will immediately sign a similar treaty. It is understood that this treaty was discussed when the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia were recently hosted by Hitler in Germany. It is believed that the signing of the non-aggression treaty is a prelude to Germany's demand that Greece accept the Axis-controlled Greco-Italian peace.

<h3>Greek Forces Launch Local Offensive; Capture Important Mountain Peak</h3>
<p>Athens: Continuous reports of Greek victories on the Albanian front continue to arrive. A Greek communiqué stated that Greek forces have launched a local offensive, driving enemy troops out of several areas. The vanguard captured 250 enemy soldiers and seized some war material. In addition, an enemy aircraft was shot down. Italian troops between Moscopole and Tepelene have been routed, abandoning a considerable amount of war material and supplies. Greek forces have also attacked the Italian lines between Chrisoula and Tepelene. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Athens: An official war report was released, stating, "Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in several locations between our forces and the enemy. Our forces captured several new Italian positions and captured approximately 10,000 enemy officers and soldiers. British aircraft also flew to the front to assist in the battle, dropping bombs and strafing enemy positions with machine guns, which was extremely effective. All British aircraft safely returned to their bases after the operation. In addition, our Northern Route Army continued to advance along several routes. Only the Pogradec area was calm and uneventful. At noon, an enemy unit launched an attack on the area near Tevole, but was repelled by our air force. In addition, after defeating the enemy's 11th Army, our Southern Route Army has taken control of the Tepelene area." (Havas News Agency report from the 18th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek radio station announced this morning that fierce fighting occurred all day yesterday along the Albanian front. It was reported that Greek forces captured a 6,000-foot mountain peak in the Tepelene area overlooking Italian positions. At the same time, a new offensive near Erbasan has also reached its intended target. Military experts point out that the Greek strategy is to concentrate attacks on certain targets rather than launch a broad offensive on the front line.

<h3>German and Italian Naval Leaders Hold Talks; Discuss Joint Strategy Against Britain; Outcome of Economic Cooperation Talks</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to sources here, Italian Undersecretary of the Navy Admiral Riccardi and German Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder held meetings on the 13th and 14th of this month in Merano, Italy. It is said that after detailed discussions, they reached a common understanding on the joint German-Italian naval strategy against Britain. (Haitong News Agency report)</p>

<p>Cairo: The Free French News Agency announced that, according to Sanusi leader Idris, speaking to a reporter from the Egyptian newspaper, Al-Ahram, one million Sanusi tribesmen from Tripolitania, Egypt, Sudan, Hejaz, Palestine, Syria, and the Sahara are currently fighting on the British side. It is said that the Sanusi tribe has been fighting Italy for freedom for more than twenty years. The abuse suffered by Muslims in Italy compared to the peace enjoyed in the British Empire is like heaven and earth. Therefore, Britain's war against dictatorship is in the interest of Islam as much as it is in the interest of Christianity. (Reuters report from the 18th)</p>

<h3>Japan Acts as if It Wishes to Be a Mediator to Resolve All International Disputes; British and Japanese Hold Talks in London</h3>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters that if Japan is invited and if the situation appears favorable, Japan is very willing to mediate any war. Ishii read a pre-prepared statement, expressing deep regret over various alarming reports that the situation in East Asia is becoming increasingly tense, and said that Japan sincerely desires peace, which is contrary to the state of military preparations being made by the United Kingdom and the United States to respond to unforeseen events in the Pacific and South China Sea. When asked whether the German official news agency reported that British Ambassador Sir Craigie had expressed the opinion of mediation when visiting the Foreign Ministry at the end of last week, Ishii did not acknowledge this statement, and said that Japan has received various alarming reports that give people the impression that the situation in East Asia is extremely tense. The unwarranted concern of certain countries over the tension in East Asia is truly surprising. We would like to state firmly that, in our eyes, there is no reason to panic about the situation in East Asia. We would like to firmly state that the aim of the Tripartite Pact is peace, so we cannot help but feel some anxiety about the military preparations made by the British government to respond to unforeseen events in the Pacific and South China Sea, even if we do not fear them. Reports about this kind of action by Britain and Italy, originating from the British and American sides, etc., are causing increasing anxiety, the result of which is that Japanese figures have suggested that Japan should immediately take necessary steps to respond to the worst-case scenario in those two areas without delay. If the U.S. government could be persuaded to limit its war preparations to the Western Hemisphere and not cause unnecessary anxiety in the hearts of the Japanese people, then the situation would definitely be greatly eased. Regardless of the motive, we really cannot see any benefit in prolonging the war. The current situation requires a lofty statesman-like demeanor, and we believe that there is no shortage of this kind of statesman-like demeanor in places such as the British Empire. Ishii concluded by saying, "We now wish to state that Japan is very willing to be a mediator, or to restore a normal state of affairs in any part of the world that is sufficient to restore a normal state of affairs. The leading powers bear a great responsibility for restoring world peace and civilization. This kind of responsibility can only be fulfilled by wise and magnanimous politicians who are willing to listen to the demands and advice of others." A reporter asked whether Japan would be willing to initiate mediation in the European war. Ishii replied that it would be willing to, as long as the relevant powers invite Japan to do so and the situation is suitable for this. Japan is currently only acting as a mediator in the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, and if the relevant powers invite it, it would also be willing to act as a mediator in other parts of the world. Ishii declined to reveal the contents of the recent talks between the British ambassador and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. When asked to provide evidence to show that Britain and the United States are making military preparations in the Pacific and South China Sea, Ishii replied that this includes stationing troops in Malaya and considering building defenses on the Samoan Islands.

<p>London: Japanese diplomatic circles today said that tension between the United Kingdom and Japan has eased noticeably after Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Shigemitsu met with British Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler yesterday. Shigemitsu and Butler talked for an hour at the British Foreign Office. Japanese diplomatic circles believe that the talks provided Butler with an opportunity to reiterate Britain's concerns about Japan's southward advance, and gave Shigemitsu an opportunity to assure Britain that Japan's current policy is not directed against Britain. It is rumored here that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie strongly expressed Britain's concern about Japan's actions in the south and Japan's current policy during his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Tokyo last Saturday.

<h3>Maintaining Friendly Relations Between Britain and Thailand</h3>
<p>Bangkok - British Minister to Thailand, Sir Josiah Crosby, stated to guests yesterday that British-Thai relations are extremely harmonious. Any contrary news circulating is utterly ridiculous and not worth refuting. It is noted that a foreign radio station broadcasted claims of a British intention to invade Thailand, which drew Mr. Crosby's attention, leading him to issue the above statement. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai government has launched an investigation into rumors of Thai citizens in southern provinces being greatly disturbed by British warships patrolling near Songkhla in Thai territorial waters, and British troops gathering at the Thai border.

<h3>No Plans to Withdraw US Troops from North China - Reports in Eastern Newspapers Untrue</h3>
<p>Local News - Officials of the Fourth Marine Regiment here declared today that the US Navy currently has no plans to withdraw from North China. The US Navy authorities criticized the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" report claiming that the US Navy is withdrawing from North China. US Navy personnel who left North China yesterday did so because they had completed their mission there, and new troops have been dispatched for reassignment. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" today prominently published a report from Tianjin stating that US Marines have withdrawn from North China. It claimed that the first batch of withdrawing troops, 30 from Tianjin and 27 from Beiping, departed by train yesterday for Qinhuangdao, to board American ships bound for Shanghai and Manila. The "Asahi Shimbun" noted that British troops withdrew from North China last year. This withdrawal of US troops has caused great unease among British and American residents in Beiping and Tianjin. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Manila - The Manila "Bulletin" reports that British women previously evacuated from Hong Kong to Baguio in the Philippines have now been ordered to evacuate to Australia. The reason is unclear, but it may be due to high living costs. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Official Discusses Dutch East Indies' Status, Linking it to Vietnam</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Vice-Minister Ohashi stated in the Diet today that Japan is currently negotiating with the Dutch government in exile in Britain, recognizing them as the governing authority of the Dutch East Indies. The status of the Dutch government in exile is unprecedented. Therefore, Japan is currently negotiating with the Dutch East Indies authorities, who are taking orders from the Dutch government in London. Answering questions, Ohashi explained in detail the relationship between the Dutch government in London and the Dutch East Indies, and the Vichy government and Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies are part of Dutch territory, while Vietnam is a French colony. Ohashi also expressed his opinion that, normally, the Dutch government would seek refuge in the Dutch East Indies, its own territory, but currently, the unnatural situation is that the government is in London while its territory is in the East Indies. Ohashi further compared this to France. A member of the Diet asked what impact Article 2 of the Tripartite Pact, which stipulates that Germany and Italy agree to recognize and respect Japan's leadership in building a new order in East Asia, would have on this situation. Ohashi replied that Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is an example of this leadership. This demonstrates that Japan will take responsibility to prevent disputes between various races in East Asia, to ensure their happiness and prosperity. Its meaning is not that Japan will occupy or conquer by force. He believes that Japan will revise its proposed southward advance policy, according to local needs. Ohashi declined to predict the situation in the event of British defeat, stating that he believes the Dutch government might then withdraw to the Dutch East Indies. Japan will take appropriate measures, based on the actions taken by the Dutch government in London in this established situation. Even if the above situation comes to pass, the target of Japan's negotiations, the Dutch East Indies government, will still exist. He believes that Japan's relationship with them will not be truly affected, as it is a matter separate from European issues. Therefore, he believes that as long as the Dutch East Indies government exists, no difficulties will arise, regardless of what happens to the Dutch government in London. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Germany Arrives in Berlin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Berlin - The new Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, arrived here yesterday afternoon. Speaking to a reporter from the "Berlin Financial Times", he stated that his mission upon returning to Germany is to further strengthen German-Japanese relations and work together to build a new world order. As for Japan's diplomatic policy towards the United States, he hopes that the United States can accurately understand Japan's goals. Considering the United States' own living space and raw material resources, it is inappropriate to interfere in the living space of other countries. (Haitong Press, 18th)</p>

Several other villages are surrounded by water and cut off from the outside world. Many houses have collapsed. The flood was caused by the Danube River north of Budapest being blocked by ice for ten miles. The authorities sent fifteen military aircraft yesterday to bomb the ice. Water levels in the Hungarian plains are also currently high, causing considerable material damage. The Tizsa basin has also suffered damage. Military and civilians are working day and night to control the flood. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Ending US Dollar Checking Accounts, Franc Exchange Rate Becomes Stronger, Speculators Hit By US Dollar Release, New Measures to be Implemented in March</h3>
<p>The New Voice Press reports that four American banks in Shanghai - Citibank, Chase, National City Bank, and American Express - have jointly decided to close US dollar checking accounts and cease opening new US dollar checking accounts starting March 1. Existing US dollar checking account holders will be allowed to remit funds to New York or transfer them to savings accounts, where they can still be withdrawn directly from the bank counters upon presentation of a savings passbook, but checks cannot be used. This does not apply to Chinese yuan accounts. It is understood that these measures are preventative in nature, aimed at preventing the abuse of US dollar checking accounts. The banks solemnly declare that these measures will not affect the interests of account holders or the overall financial situation in Shanghai. They hope that account holders will not believe rumors circulating outside.</p>
<p>Franc Exchange Rate Soars Yesterday</p>
<p>Since American banks here announced that they would abolish all US dollar checking accounts starting March 1, the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan (franc) has become stronger, reaching a new high for the year. At closing, one hundred yuan rose to a high of US$5.87. According to business circles, American banks have taken the initial steps to prepare for a possible withdrawal from the Far East in the event of war in the Pacific. This move not only protects the interests of the banks but also the interests of account holders. They also pointed out that if the American banks did not make these new preparations in advance, difficulties would arise if war broke out. Now that these preparations have been made, they should be able to cope with ease. Since the announcement of the new measures, a large number of US dollars have been released into the foreign exchange market in this city, in stark contrast to the situation of the past few days. It is reported that the Japanese are also releasing US dollars in large quantities. At the same time, the Chinese government banks are not actively buying up the US dollars released into the market. In addition, stock prices have fallen due to the strong yuan, returning to the low prices of last week.</p>
<p>Profound Analysis by Economic Commentator</p>
<p>The famous economic commentator Arus published an article in the English-language "China Press" yesterday, commenting on the American banks' move to stop US dollar checking accounts in the city. Financial circles here have offered conflicting comments on the recent measures taken by American banks. This move is undoubtedly a very important action and will inevitably have some impact on the financial circles of this city. However, it is extremely thoughtless to believe that this move indicates that the general situation in Shanghai will turn for the worse in a few days.</p>
<p>This Move Protects the Interests of Account Holders</p>
<p>American banks have been considering implementing this measure for some time, and there is more than one motivation. The most important thing is that the American banks plan to provide account holders with the greatest possible protection. Tensions between Japan and the United States have been high for months. Since October of last year, people in Shanghai have been deeply fearful that war will break out soon. Once war in the Pacific truly breaks out, banks in Shanghai, including American banks, will not be able to conduct business as usual.</p>
<p>Switching to Savings Passbooks Has Other Advantages</p>
<p>Savings account holders with current deposits have a savings passbook, which is sufficient to prove the amount of money they have deposited, which is more than what they have withdrawn. However, the situation is different for checking account holders. They have no documents to prove their initial deposit amount, as they receive a transaction statement once a month. American banks also report these transactions to their home country daily by mail. Knowing this situation, one can understand the advantages of converting US dollar checking accounts to savings accounts.</p>
<p>Accumulation of US Dollars Too High</p>
<p>Another reason why American banks are implementing new measures is that they feel that their accumulation of US dollars is too high and has exceeded reasonable standards, which is not appropriate even from a business perspective. The American banks in this city believe that their accumulated US dollars should be transferred to the New York headquarters of the two banks and their branches throughout the United States. They encourage the direct opening of US dollar checking accounts in the United States to reduce their burden. Another purpose of the American banks' new measures may be to frustrate foreign exchange speculators in Shanghai and provide new assistance to the Chinese yuan. However, American banks guarantee that their cessation of US dollar checking accounts should not be regarded as a type of monetary policy, as transactions with yuan account holders will continue uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>Rampant Rumors in the Market, Foreign Rice Breaks Price Limit, Thoroughly Investigate Rice Stocks, Severely Punish Speculation, Do Not Hesitate Any Longer</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw the highest price of foreign rice exceed the limit of 85 yuan per stone due to speculators continuing to spread rumors in the market and black market dealings reappearing. The city's food situation is once again becoming serious. If this is not stopped immediately, there could be dire consequences. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Rice-Producing Areas See Shuttle Shipping</p>
<p>The rumors spread by speculators in the rice market yesterday were that the shipping of Hong Kong rice would soon be banned, and that the evolution of the situation in the Far East would hinder the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai. However, according to actual facts, 12,000 bags of Hong Kong rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Furthermore, shipping in Southeast Asia is being maintained as usual. The Norwegian ship Sal and the French ship Los have successively sailed to Saigon, and the ships sailing to Hong Kong today include the Guangdong, Suzhou, Taiyuan, Hubei, and Mingsheng, a total of five ships. The Guangdong will also travel to Siam, and the Langli is scheduled to sail to Rangoon tomorrow. Since shipping in rice-producing areas is smooth, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice. The so-called ban on the export of Hong Kong foreign rice is also a baseless rumor. Furthermore, Hong Kong is only a transit port for foreign rice, and a ban would not greatly affect our port's rice market, as rice merchants in this city can directly order from foreign production areas. However, speculators, seeing that the rice stocks in this port are abundant and the source is abundant, and that rice prices will gradually fall, are deliberately creating unfounded rumors to disrupt the market and raise prices, simply to satisfy their private desires for profit.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate Rice Stocks Without Tolerance</p>
<p>High food prices make it increasingly difficult for residents to make a living. However, the step-by-step increase in rice prices is due to the manipulation and monopoly of speculative rice profiteers. The amount of rice being hoarded is very substantial, and the source remains unobstructed. It is hoped that the authorities of the two settlements will conduct a secret investigation of the rice warehouse stocks as soon as possible. If it is found that there are long-term hoards that are not intended to be released on schedule, their real owners' names, the date of entry into the warehouse, and the purchase price of the rice should be recorded, and they should be urged to supply the market immediately. Otherwise, the rice will be confiscated and used for price stabilization to relieve civilians, and the amount of rice accumulated in the investigation should be made public in the newspapers so that the public can know. If the matter is handled vaguely and they are allowed to go with the flow, rice prices will inevitably rise again, and it may be difficult to maintain the price limit. At that time, what would happen to social order is unimaginable. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council's investigation of food rice last week showed a large increase. The food rice stocks of the bean rice firms in the Bean Rice Industry Association alone totaled 811,076 bags, an increase of 145,403 bags compared to the previous period. In addition, rice shops, warehouses, and storehouses also have large stocks, and the number of rice stocks accumulated by private individuals such as manufacturers is also large.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Elections Rushing Forward, British and American Candidates to be Selected by End of Month, Five Japanese Candidates to be Introduced Next Week</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese community in Shanghai began preparing yesterday for the Shanghai Municipal Council annual elections on April 2 and 3. It is widely believed that the Japanese side will nominate five candidates as in the past to participate in the election. It is expected that the Japanese candidates will be formally selected within a week after the re-election of the Executive Committee of the Japanese Residents Association on Saturday and Sunday this week. It is understood that there are already 42 candidates, only half of whom will be formally elected as members of the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>British and American Candidates to be Recommended</p>
<p>Although the American community has already nominated two candidates, the American Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the community yesterday, stating that candidates can still be nominated, but the deadline is strictly set at the 27th of this month, and no more will be added. Therefore, a second round of voting will not be held, and Mr. Allman and Mr. Mills will formally be the candidates for the next Municipal Council election. The British Association is responsible for recommending British candidate directors and will recommend candidates in the near future and will decide on countermeasures, as the competition between Britain and Japan is extremely fierce. As for the number of candidates, it will be the same as in the past, a total of five. However, it is generally expected that the five current British directors, including Mr. Cornell, Mr. Wilkie, and Mr. MacDonald, will be re-elected.</p>
<p>Election Register Being Expedited</p>
<p>Regarding the compilation of the electoral roll, it is stipulated that any individual or business not listed in the final electoral roll will have no right to vote. This list can be published after March 2 and posted in the reception room of the Shanghai Municipal Council at 209 Jiangxi Road and at various police stations. It will also be distributed to foreign consulates, foreign organizations, and clubs. Those who wish to be listed and change landlords and addresses must notify the Taxation Office before March 2. After the deadline, it will be invalid. If any errors or omissions are found in the preliminary electoral roll published on December 31 of last year, they should be reported to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation immediately.</p>
<h3>Seventh Anniversary of the New Life Movement Today, A Great Commemoration</h3>
<p>Today is the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. The people of all circles in this city commemorate the motive of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's initiation of the New Life Movement seven years ago, which was to revitalize the lives of the people, eliminate corrupt habits, enhance the physical strength of the entire people, and jointly build a glorious country. Now that the war of resistance and national construction is approaching the stage of victory, we should continue to inherit the past spirit and implement it from beginning to end. Therefore, we are all determined to make a great commemoration with perseverance and unyielding will, in accordance with the clear precepts of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor.</p>
<h3>British and American Organizations in Shanghai Assist in Evacuation Matters, Citizens of Both Countries are Willing to Follow Advice, Timely Evacuation to Meet Government Expectations</h3>
<p>The British authorities reiterated the evacuation advice on the evening of the 16th. This advice is most applicable to British women and children in the occupied areas. Even for citizens in non-occupied areas, the authorities strongly support and will provide considerable convenience if they feel there is no need to stay in China and intend to evacuate. In recent days, British community organizations such as the British Association of Shanghai, the British Women's Association, the Veterans Association, and the Royal Air Force Association have all been concerned about this matter and are striving to cooperate with the authorities to promote the evacuation of citizens for the safety of individuals and the country. Although this is only advice in nature and has absolutely no mandatory meaning, citizens are generally able to consider the overall situation and the government's painstaking efforts to take precautionary measures and prevent problems before they occur, and are also willing to evacuate in a timely manner. Yesterday, a British woman told a reporter, "As a British person, I should follow any form of well-intentioned advice from the government."</p>
<p>British Citizens in Tianjin and Beiping Gather in Shanghai</p>
<p>British citizens are concentrated in Tianjin and Beiping, totaling five to six hundred people. After receiving the consulate's evacuation advice, they, realizing that the situation may indeed change, intend to pack their bags and concentrate in Shanghai in the short term to wait for ships to go to the future. According to transportation circles, there are two routes for the evacuation of British citizens: first, to take ships of the American President Lines to the United States and then transfer to Canada; second, to take British merchant ships such as Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire to British territories such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rangoon, and then transfer to Australia or the British mainland. However, it is feared that not many will return to their home country, and Australia and Rangoon are the most ideal places to settle down.</p>
<p>The Coolidge Carries Citizens in Evacuation</p>
<p>It is learned that the largest ship of the company, the President Coolidge, is the most recent to sail from Shanghai to the United States. It is expected to return to Shanghai from Manila on the 25th of this month, and will cross the Pacific Ocean and sail to the United States the next day. The ship can originally carry 900 passengers. Recently, due to the large number of citizens evacuated from Manila and Shanghai, small beds have been temporarily added, bringing the total number of berths to over 1,200. The ship's berths are almost sold out, and some of the American citizens in Japan will also board the ship in Yokohama and Kobe to return to their home country.</p>
<p>Evacuation Committee Handles Relief</p>
<p>The evacuation committee formed by the US Consulate General, the American Chamber of Commerce, and the American Association has resumed its work due to the authorities reiterating the evacuation order. The main responsibilities of the committee are investigation, registration, and subsidy. It is learned that 16 people have requested subsidies for travel expenses from the committee. In order to seriously handle the matter and prevent fraud and fraudulent claims, the committee is conducting a strict investigation. Once the investigation is conclusive, a corresponding subsidy will be provided, and they will be designated to board the American President Lines mail ships that regularly depart for their home country. It is estimated that the total number of American citizens in this port who should be evacuated is around 1,500, and one-third of them can return to their home country within an appropriate period.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang: Continued Collection of Donations</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper reported on the achievements of New Pu Yu Tang in rescuing women and children over the years and the recent exhaustion of its relief funds, it has received sympathy and generous donations from all sectors of society for several consecutive days.

<h3>"Ziba De" Ship Sails Out Today, Dutch Ship Resumes Voyage</h3>
<p>The Dutch ship operating on the Far East route was ordered to suspend its voyage by the Dutch government last Thursday, causing the "Ziz Sujia" mail ship of the Java Company, which had arrived in the Philippines, to be ordered to anchor in Little Luzon and stop its northward journey. After arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 14th, the "Ziba De" ship originally planned to return south that night, but received a telegram from the head office, allowing it to unload arriving goods in Shanghai and load exports. Now it is known that the suspension order has been lifted, so the "Ziz Lianjia" ship, which was anchored in the Philippines, has also set sail north and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong today and in Shanghai within this week. The "Ziba De" ship in Shanghai will load all export goods today and return to Java along its original route. The Royal Company's "Tegel Berg" ship, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, failed to arrive on time due to the above-mentioned impact. It has now resumed its voyage and should arrive in port within a few days. The American President Lines' "President Coolidge" mail ship passed through Shanghai on the 12th of this month to go to Southeast Asia and will return north from the Philippines today, arriving in Shanghai on the 25th and departing for Japan and the United States on the 26th, one day later than the scheduled sailing date.</p>
<h3>American Transport Ship "Chamom" to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday, the American 10,000-ton transport ship "Chamom" is expected to arrive in Shanghai from North China this afternoon (the 19th) and dock at the British naval pontoon. It is reported that the "Chamom" came south from the United States via Manila and Qinhuangdao. After arriving in Shanghai, one hundred U.S. Marines will disembark to take over duties, replacing one hundred and five U.S. Marines whose terms have expired. It is also reported that one hundred and fifty U.S. military personnel who have completed their travels in China from Beijing and Tianjin will also be transported back to the United States. Although the official departure date of the ship has not been announced, it is generally believed that the ship will leave here tomorrow (the 20th), taking the route through Manila, Guam, and Honolulu back to the United States.</p>
<h3>Chinese Directors Give Farewell Dinner for Colonel Xiang Pei</h3>
<p>Colonel Xiang Pei, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, has been in office for three years and is about to leave Shanghai to return to his country to participate in the war. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Xi Yuhua, Chen Tingrui and other Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the fact that the Commander's term of office coincided with a turbulent period in the city and that he had made significant contributions to local security and planning and commanding, held a farewell dinner at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Club at noon yesterday (the 18th) on behalf of the Chinese merchants and residents to express their gratitude. In addition to the Chinese directors, the attendees included Lieutenant Colonel Mann, Major Endus, Xu Tonghao, Bai Tuolai, Hu Junqiu, Captain Mao Fei, and Major Chen Shixia, the Chinese squad leader. During the dinner, Yu Qiaqing presided and gave a brief speech, praising the Commander's leadership in defense and skillful deployment, so that the tense situations in the past had been safely overcome, and presented a briefcase and a commemorative inscription to express farewell. The Commander humbly accepted and considered it an honor. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed at a late hour.</p>
<h3>Opinions Solicited for Tax System Reform</h3>
<p>In order to study the fairness of the tax system, the Municipal Council recently established a Tax System Committee and issued a notice welcoming opinions from all sectors, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that those who have responded to the invitation to express their opinions are not enthusiastic, so the Council yesterday issued another notice, urging all sectors willing to attend the Committee's meetings and express their opinions to promptly send their names to Room 165 of the Council Office at 209 Jiangxi Road, so that the Committee can conduct its research and complete its work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Telegram to Congratulate London Salvation Army on its 50th Anniversary</h3>
<p>The London Salvation Army recently held a 50th anniversary celebration. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the Salvation Army's dedication to social service and public welfare in Shanghai, especially its responsibility for presiding over the relief of beggars, sent a telegram to express its admiration and congratulations.</p>
<h3>Distributing Hot Meals</h3>
<p>Salvation Army Brigadier Ma Lishi stated that Chinese and foreign people in this city have enthusiastically donated to the Salvation Army's 175,000-yuan fundraising campaign. To date, 124,000 yuan in national currency has been received. The Salvation Army is now dispatching multiple food carts to distribute hot meals to poor Chinese people on the roadside. Donors are requested to send their donations to the Salvation Army headquarters at 40 Nanjing Road, Sassoon House.</p>
<h3>Rescuing People from Hardship is a Great Act of Righteousness – May All Readers of This Newspaper Rise Up Together</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, people from various places have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. Initially, it was thought that the situation could be quickly resolved and they could return to their hometowns to resume their businesses. However, year after year, their travel funds have dwindled and they have nowhere to turn. This kind of predicament is unimaginable to those who have not experienced it firsthand. This newspaper has received a large number of letters from refugees stranded in Shanghai. In addition to providing possible assistance whenever possible, there is no way to arrange for each of them one by one. Drawing on others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses is an endless lament. Thinking that there must be many enthusiastic people among the readers of this newspaper, if they can provide active assistance to people in need, then not only will those who benefit be grateful beyond measure, but it will also be a great act of righteousness that benefits society and the country. Now, Mr. Zhong Daohua has submitted a letter to this newspaper.</p>
<h3>Actively Helping People</h3>
<p>Gaining the sympathetic help of all sectors of society. The words are sincere and touching, and the reasoning is clear. Readers, if you have the spare capacity to help others, please communicate directly with Mr. Zhong, or send it through this newspaper. However, this newspaper advocates actively helping people. If there is a suitable position, it is best to employ them. Giving money is only saving people temporarily.</p>

There is no shortage of warm-hearted people in the world, with compassionate and kind hearts, who may be able to introduce me to a job or provide financial assistance. If I can get any of these, I will be grateful to you, sir, without end. I sincerely ask, and wish you good health.</p>

<h3>Check on Gambling Dens in the Chinese Quarter, Lu Ding Shot and Killed, One Assailant Shot and Captured, Stray Bullets Injure Two Passersby, Lu Was Previously Attacked Three Months Ago</h3>
<p>At nine o'clock yesterday morning, a shooting assassination case suddenly occurred on Rue des Soeurs, French Concession. The victim, Lu Ding, was shot twice and died soon after. One of the shooters was shot and captured while trying to escape. Stray bullets injured one man and one woman. The details of the case are as follows: Lu Ding, a native of Changshu, 26 years old, resides at No. 6 Defeng Lane, Rue du Cercle, French Concession. He previously opened Wanli Rice Store on Fangxie Road in the Chinese Quarter and was a shareholder in the former Huili gambling den in the Four Roads area. Now he is in charge of checking gambling dens at Huale Hotel at 792 Yu Garden Road.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Inspector</h3>
<p>At 9:05 yesterday morning, Lu left his home due to the rain, wearing a gray raincoat. Unexpectedly, when he passed the intersection of Rue des Soeurs and Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, a man wearing a coarse woolen robe suddenly pulled out a gun and fired two shots at Lu, both hitting his waist. He fell wounded in a pool of blood at the entrance of No. 4, Laoda Fang Teashop, No. 27 Rue des Soeurs. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, the shooter ran towards the Xiaocaichang area on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot. The constable on duty at post number 847 nearby, having heard the alarm, rushed to the scene. At the same time, a patrol team from the French police station was searching pedestrians. The shooter took the initiative to fire and resist arrest. The police also attacked from the front and back, firing shots. For a time, gunshots rang out, and pedestrians fled in panic. The two sides fired a total of</p>
<h3>More Than Forty Shots</h3>
<p>As a result, the shooter was shot twice in the leg and fell to the ground, surrendering. A pistol was seized from him, and the bullets in the chamber had been used up. By this time, the French police station had dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, and urgently summoned a car to take Lu Ding and the shooter to the hospital. Lu died soon after due to his serious injuries. According to the shooter's confession, his name is Feng Shude, a native of Ningbo, 26 years old. When the shooter opened fire to resist arrest, the bullets were like a string of pearls, injuring an old man, Zhang Heming (a local, 61 years old), in the left leg, and a woman, Chen Li (from Jiangbei, 32 years old), in the right leg. They were also taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment by car afterwards. The police station is investigating the case. As for Lu's assassination, this is the second time. The first was on the evening of November 21 last year, when Lu held a wedding at the Dasanxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Held Wedding Ceremony</h3>
<p>He was shot from the side of the stairs, and the bullet missed. Because the shooter was being pursued, he fired shots along the way, fatally wounding Chen Jinsheng (25 years old), a carter from Chongming, who drove a Phoenix Guide Agency chartered car at the roadside. Unexpectedly, after three months, he was shot again and finally died. The French police station has ordered a strict investigation into the cause of the bloody case. Lu's body has been transferred to the Taillacherie Road morgue for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down on Rue de la Maréchal Joffre, Two Gambling Cases Sentenced Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 5:20 yesterday evening, West Constable Parker of the Putuo Road Police Station, Chinese Constable Lu Dagong, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, and Sergeant Chen Hongbin raided a large-scale gambling den located at No. 4, Lane 194, Rue de la Maréchal Joffre, arresting the owner, Xu Zhixiang (from Changzhou, in his thirties), and sixteen gamblers, both men and women, and seizing a large number of gambling tools. They are currently being held at the police station, awaiting transfer to the court for punishment.</p>
<h3>Gambling and Taking Commissions, Punished Separately</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Police Station broke up a gambling den in the Yangzi Hotel on Yunnan Road the night before. The night before, Chinese detective Zhou Zhenxing and others broke up a gambling den in Room 814 of the hotel, arresting the owner, Yu Renzhi, and gamblers such as Lin Longchang, a total of twenty-one people, and seizing a large number of gambling tools such as pai gow and chips. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special First District Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed a lawsuit according to law. After questioning by Judge Fang, the owner was sentenced to six months in prison and fined three hundred yuan. The other sixteen gamblers were each fined one hundred yuan, and four people were fined fifty yuan. The gambling tools were all confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Shatou Gambling Case Was Also Judged Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department's gambling squad previously cracked down on a large-scale gambling den on the second floor of the Yindu Ballroom at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Massenet, arresting twelve suspects and seizing a large number of gambling tools such as roulette tables, big and small apples. The police department's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, sued in the Special First District Court, and the case has been concluded. Yesterday, Judge Shen Yi announced the verdict: Zhou Guansong was sentenced to eight months in prison, Gu Baoyu to six months in prison, and Chen Ashi, Wang Maijun, Qian Huiliang, Xu Jinsheng, Zhu Huitang, Yi Amao, Chen Zhifa, Wang Shunmu, and Gu Songmei were each sentenced to three months in prison.

<h3>Japanese Secret Agent Disguised as Chinese Arrested on Avenue Foch, Concealed a Pistol Found by Detectives, Released After Being Identified as Japanese</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Press, yesterday (the 17th) at around 9:30 a.m., an officer from the Japanese military intelligence team, disguised as Chinese, wearing a long gown and carrying a pistol, was riding on a Route 2 bus when he was arrested on Avenue Foch, Rue Paul Beau when police detectives were inspecting passengers. They found a pistol near him and took him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The Japanese immediately declared that he was not Chinese, but a Japanese military intelligence agent. After the police station confirmed this with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese was released. It was reported that when the police officers boarded the Route 2 bus to inspect, they finally inspected the Japanese. Because he looked very much like a Chinese, they went forward to search him and found a pistol, so they tied his hands and took him to the police station.</p>
<h3>Large and Small Gambling Dens in the Chinese Quarter Suddenly All Closed Yesterday, Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling When Special Police Force Established in Western District</h3>
<p>The News Agency reported that the gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter are numerous, even more so than before, surpassing the time when gambling dens were rampant in the Western District years ago. It is estimated that there are currently forty to fifty gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter, with the sound of gambling everywhere, which is deeply regrettable. However, good times do not last. Starting from dawn yesterday, some party suddenly ordered all large and small gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter to be closed and took back their licenses. Therefore, from yesterday, the gambling dens have been heavily locked, with no sign of anyone. However, according to another source, although the gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter have been ordered to close, they will be revived in a few days.</p>
<h3>Gambling Places in the Chinese Quarter All Closed</h3>
<p>Gambling dens in the Chinese Quarter were all closed yesterday. It is said that the reason is that Lu Ying issued a notice in January ordering all gambling dens to change their licenses, but they have not complied to this day. Therefore, Lu Ying ordered them to stop operating today. It is also said that the Sixth Country Hotel will also be closed today. Whether this is reliable remains to be confirmed. As for the previous rumor that the Sixth Country Hotel would move to Xiaoshijie, it is said that the Xiaoshijie building has not yet been renovated, so the Sixth Country Hotel's move is probably still early.</p>
<h3>Opium and Gambling in the Western District Also Rumored to Close</h3>
<p>The Pingming Agency reported that the "special police force" in the Western District's extra-settlement road area will soon be established, and all opium dens and gambling dens are facing their last days. Recently, several have closed or moved to the Nanshi Chinese Quarter every day. It is reported that large-scale gambling dens such as the Sixth Country Hotel, Baile Hotel, and Lianqiao General Assembly, as well as some small gambling dens, commonly known as "yellow cattle sheds," and opium dens such as Nanchengxin, Yizhixiang, and Sihaichun, totaling no less than a hundred, large and small, have all been closed since yesterday. According to well-informed sources, some of the larger gambling dens may temporarily suspend business for a few days, waiting to obtain "understanding" and then plan to revive and return to life.</p>
<h3>Cooking Rice with Scraps Ignites Hand Grenade, Exploding and Injuring Four Men and Women</h3>
<p>A coolie living at No. 218, Wuchang Road, Hongkou, picked up old paper and wood shavings from a nearby garbage pile yesterday morning around 8:00 a.m. to burn at home. Unexpectedly, a hand grenade was mixed in among them, and it suddenly exploded when ignited, injuring four men and women on the spot. They are: Shao Fu Huang Zhu, 26 years old, injured in the right leg; girl Huang Meimei, only four years old, injured in the left waist; man Bao Zhenbao, 23 years old, injured in the left leg; and Zhang Ziying, 21 years old, injured in both hands. Afterwards, the constable summoned an ambulance to send the four injured men and women to the Bazilu Sanatorium for treatment.</p>
<h3>Man Jumps from Anle Palace Hotel and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>At 11:40 last night, a man in his thirties, wearing a blue cloth long gown, for some unknown reason, had the idea of suicide at the Anle Palace Hotel at 57 Avenue Edward VII. He went to the platform on the fourth floor of the hotel and jumped down, falling in front of the Yuantai Woolen Shop at the corner, seriously injured and in critical condition. Afterwards, the Chinese constable from the French police station took him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Cancels Quarantine</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office now believes that the plague in eastern Zhejiang has long been eradicated and that there is no need to inspect ships entering the port. It has announced that quarantine will be canceled from the 15th of this month, and has sent letters to various shipping companies to inform all import and export ships. However, ships exported before February 15 will still be subject to inspection upon entry.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<h3>Finance, Foreign Exchange Selling Trend Increases Day by Day, HSBC Quotes Consistently Lengthen, US Dollar Not Far From Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC quoted at 9:30 a.m., with the British exchange rate revised to three shillings, four pence, three and three-quarters of a penny, up 0.0625, and the US exchange rate quoted at five and a half yuan, down 0.125. Other Dutch, French, Japanese, and other exchange rates consistently lengthened. As for the domestic market situation, the selling trend increased day by day. According to foreign news, the US government officially announced that the agreement for the Sino-US Exchange Stabilization Fund is still under discussion and will be concluded soon. After this, China will no longer need to use foreign exchange to purchase American goods, and it will be extremely capable of restoring the Chinese people's confidence in legal tender and preventing speculation in foreign exchange. Federal Security Administrator McNutt's broadcast also provided greater economic assistance to China, showing that China's economic future is bright. However, the American Bank of Shanghai canceled current account deposits in foreign currencies and changed them to savings deposits with passbooks in order to prevent possible events and prevent improper leaks, which had a particularly profound impact on people's minds. Both domestic and foreign banks took action to unload their holdings. However, the foreign exchange funds currently left in Shanghai mostly belong to general merchants and the middle and lower classes. As for the large accounts with hundreds of thousands, millions, or even tens of millions, they have long been remitted to the United States, and there is no need for them to sell. It is heard that the American Bank has notified its depositors that the freezing of foreign exchange is a matter of course, but because the United States still needs to consider its commercial dealings, it cannot take a decisive approach and only slightly restricts it by changing checking accounts to savings accounts. What should be noted afterwards is that once foreign currencies are changed to savings passbooks, the withdrawal procedures and the number of restrictions are inevitable. After the opening in the morning, it went from 5.6875 yuan to 5.78125 yuan, and the current US exchange rate is 5.8125 yuan, and the market feels looser and cheaper. The US exchange rate was strongest at 5.875 yuan, close to six yuan.

As a result of the evening closing, the current US exchange rate fell to 5.75 yuan, and the forward order was still three shillings and a half penny.

<h3>Headline: Empty Accounts Surge, Gold Market Enters the 6,000 Yuan Mark, Spot Price Still About 300 Yuan Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash settlement dark market saw an increasingly rapid decline, breaking through the 6,000 yuan mark and then falling through the 5,900 and 5,800 yuan levels. The lowest point reached 5,775 yuan, creating a difference of nearly 300 yuan between the high and low. Short selling gained momentum with great force. Although the long side tried hard to recover, public confidence was weak, and buying was difficult to expand. The morning opened already suppressed within the 6,000 yuan range, at 5,980 yuan, but briefly rose to 6,070 yuan, reportedly due to buying by the Shanghai West group. Subsequently, it suffered a setback, plummeting to 5,865 yuan. The noon close was still reported at 5,905 yuan. The afternoon opening reached 5,940 yuan, but Tong Kang Yong, Yi Yuan, and Xin Da Yong jointly sold, causing a sharp drop to 5,775 yuan. At 3:15 PM, a foreign wire reported that the Japanese side, in talks with British and American reporters, aimed to avoid joining the war in the Pacific, which boosted the market. He Sheng, Xin Feng, Yong Ren, and Cheng Yong bought, gradually pushing the price back up to 5,990 yuan. The closing price was 5,950 yuan, a slight decrease of 110 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. After the close, the off-exchange market was already trading at 6,000 yuan. The spot market still saw prices about 300 yuan higher than futures, with limited trading volume. The total volume of futures trading was over 40,000 taels. For swaps, the premium for buying March instead of February narrowed to a maximum of 30 yuan, eventually settling around 10 yuan. Silver shop jewelry gold briefly dropped to 640 yuan per tael, eventually closing flat. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Settlement Falls by 110 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, the off-exchange decline that started after the previous day's close had already intensified. Public confidence was unsteady, and the short side's momentum was overwhelming. All parties opened by suppressing the price to 5,980 yuan, 80 yuan lower than the previous day's low. After the opening, the Shanghai West group, including Xin Yuan, bought in, causing a rebound past the 6,000 yuan mark, rising to 6,070 yuan. Upon hearing reports that foreign exchange rates were expected to remain firm, selling suddenly increased sharply, pushing the price back down into the 6,000 yuan range and breaking below 5,900 yuan. It was estimated that Tian Yi Yuan, Shi He, and securities firms followed suit, selling, driving the price to a low of 5,865 yuan. Subsequently, relying on the persistent buying by Da Feng, Cheng Ji, Heng Ji, and others, the price gradually rose to 5,935 yuan. After this, the market fluctuated within a very narrow range. The noon close was reported at 5,905 yuan. The afternoon opening was relatively stable at 5,910 yuan, and bill traders slightly absorbed supply up to 5,940 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong and Yi Yuan remained determined to sell, breaking into the 5,900 yuan level after a long period of hovering, and eventually pushing down into the 5,800 yuan level, with a low of 5,775 yuan. The stay within the 5,800 yuan range was brief, and the price rebounded above 5,800 yuan, due to aggressive buying by He Pan, Xin Feng, Yong Ren, Cheng Yong, and others, slowly rising. Before the close, it had risen to 5,950 yuan, but the closing price dropped to 5,950 yuan, a decrease of 110 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The off-exchange market was quite high after the close, with reports of trades at 6,000 yuan. The daily range was 295 yuan.

<h3>Headline: Grain Market, Rice Market Thrives Extravagantly, Spot Prices Rise Before Futures, People's Food is All Wasted</h3>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taiyuan ship of the Da Gu Company arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong with 6,000 bags. The Jiangsu ship also arrived yesterday afternoon from the port, carrying 2,936 bags. The Yisheng ship of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, also from Hong Kong, carrying 3,244 bags. A total of 12,180 bags of imported rice arrived yesterday. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend of imported rice intensified, due to speculators hoarding and actually selling all their supplies under the influence of a speculative atmosphere. Regardless of ample supply and crowded arrivals, pricing was uniform, only knowing how to aggressively buy, with profits immediately realized after purchase, and ignoring future reversals. Generally, manipulators took advantage of this opportunity to promote aggressively, with the encouraging force increasing as the smell of gunpowder intensified. The more intense the buying, the higher the selling price. Spot rice was pushed up first, followed by futures, each responding to the other, driving prices higher and higher. Both spot and futures rice were driven up by more than a yuan. After the limit price was reached, high-priced goods were often not displayed, leading to rumors of off-exchange trades at a premium of one or two yuan. Although confirmation was sought, public sentiment was further disturbed. There were six or seven new futures transactions involving ships under negotiation, as the current exchange-rate-based pricing was already low, and large volumes could be transacted as soon as ships became available. Call futures were lively, with over 2,000 tons sold, prices rising from 5 or 6 jiao to one yuan. Saigon Road cargo No. 1 and February futures were both at 97 yuan, spot cargo No. 2 at 94 yuan, broken rice for the end of the month at 75 yuan and 1 jiao, February at 76 yuan, March at 76 yuan and 5 jiao, small mixed rice spot at 90 yuan and 91 yuan, cargo loaded on the 15th of January and cargo en route loaded in January both at 90 yuan, and February from 87 yuan and 89 yuan and 3 jiao to 5 jiao. Spot prices were softer at closing, but the high and low prices were confusing, effectively raising prices. The closing price for No. 1 new Saigon was 85 yuan to 84 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan, 79 yuan, Siam No. 1 at 85 yuan, closing at 82 yuan and a half, Huowen at 84 yuan, then at 82 yuan and 5 jiao, Xiaowen Pudong warehouse at 76 yuan, 75 yuan and 8 jiao, Guangdong rice at 86 yuan, Milu at 73 yuan, broken tip at 67 yuan, closing at broken rice No. 3 at 82 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Thick and Thin Geng and other domestic rice varieties were still sold out upon arrival. Some remaining stocks were treated as rare commodities, so sellers became outrageous when asked, quoting prices as high as three or four yuan. However, buyers, lacking goods to use, tried to depress prices, but found it difficult to resist. As a result, opening prices were more than two yuan higher than the previous market. Kunshan Yuanbai Geng sold for 110 yuan to 108 yuan, sold by the bucket for 106 yuan to 102.1 yuan, and Qingjiao Baodao sold by the bucket for 101 and a half yuan to 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The actual sale of glutinous rice continues without any alleviation. However, major players continued to absorb cheap grain, causing sellers to also raise prices significantly, increasing prices by one and a half yuan. Hong Kong special white rice opened at 83 and a half yuan, ordinary at 82 yuan, glutinous rice at 75 yuan and 7 jiao, 75 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Headline: Flour Supply Suddenly Stops, Large Quantities of Imported Flour Expected at the End of the Month, Wheat Stocks in the Concessions Reach 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>The flour market is quite tight, mainly because the Chinese factories' low-priced flour has suddenly suspended supply due to a shortage of raw materials, causing immediate public anxiety. New arrivals of imported flour are only over 30,000 bags, reportedly Canadian flour of the Golden Dragon brand, unsuitable for local customers, and priced at 24 yuan. Large quantities of new supplies are expected at the end of the month. In the current tense atmosphere between Japan and the United States, holders are seizing the opportunity to speculate and raise prices, and local customers are becoming more active in hoarding. The overall market is selling Clock Tower brand Australian flour for over 3,000 bags, with prices already rising to 24 yuan and 9 jiao. Prices for cargo en route have reached over 25 yuan, and cargo with delivery at the end of the month is priced at 24 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 4 or 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Currently, Australian and American flours are arriving one after another, and there is no concern of a flour shortage in the local market. However, there is concern that the supply may be interrupted at any time, and the future market is affected by international tensions.</p>
<p>The wheat market is also quietly rising, mainly because the domestic supply has almost been cut off, and stocks in the Shanghai market have long been depleted. Recently, the price of wheat in Wuxi has risen by a considerable 10 yuan per bag. Local wheat in Shanghai is difficult to purchase. The supply of imported wheat is also limited due to a lack of ship space, making it impossible to replenish. As a result, public confidence is growing, and wheat stored in concessions was even quoted at 40 yuan yesterday. Dozens of bags were traded on this street. The purchase price of Japanese factories is still limited to the original price, but there is no more stock available.</p>
<h3>Headline: Oil Cakes Cover Shorts Turn Long, All At Once</h3>
<p>Actual sales of oil cakes remain sluggish, with the overall situation completely dominated by speculation. Therefore, the market is constantly changing. Yesterday, although the closing price the previous day was suppressed to flat, the market believed that the bulls were in control, leading to a reversal from covering shorts to turning long, with frequent buying. The highest price of soybean oil rose by three or four yuan, and soybean cake rose by three or four jiao. However, the closing price saw a slight retracement.</p>
<h3>Headline: Cotton Yarn, Cotton Yarn Bulls and Bears Have Different Views, Double Horse Fluctuates by Fifty or Sixty Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market fluctuates greatly, and the trend is sudden and uncertain. This is because public sentiment is confused. However, actual sales are gradually becoming more active. The Hong Kong group has a growing need for 10-count yarn. It is reported that there is a small dock at the arched bridge that can be used for transportation, so those in the industry have good intentions. However, speculators continue to sell and take a negative view, showing that both sides have different opinions. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,233 yuan, the low price was 1,175 yuan, the price at the start of the afternoon trading session was 1,206 yuan, later falling to 1,181 yuan, and the final price was 1,215 yuan. Some want to buy, and 215 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse saw the market selling in unison due to the poor sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,209 yuan, and the price fell by two hundred yuan in an instant to 1,175 yuan. Then, the shorts took profits and covered their positions, and the price rose again. At the same time, the Hong Kong group had an actual need for around 2,000 bales, and public sentiment was rebuilt, driving the price up to 1,233 yuan. After 11:00 AM, news of falling prices caused sellers to become active again, and the price fell again to 1,181 yuan. The closing price was slightly better at 1,192 yuan. The total number of bales traded during the half-day session was 9,355. The amount bought by each group is listed on the right: Hong Kong: 1,855, Other businesses: 7,500, Total: 9,355.</p>
<h3>Headline: The Cotton Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is as sluggish as ever. Because foreign exchange is being loosened and gold prices are fluctuating, public sentiment is confused, so business has entered a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to selling by foreign merchants, and then rose again due to buying by the same industry and spot merchants. As a result, the closing price was up one or two pound notes compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market continued to fall sharply due to heavy selling pressure and selling by all parties. Yesterday, daily forecasts predicted another small three rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has declined as spot yarn prices continue to worsen, and international events are increasingly confusing. Therefore, foreign cotton trading has also declined and no one cares about it.</p>
<h3>Headline: Securities, Bond Market Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gray market for public bonds saw short covering on one side and continued selling on the other. The bulls believed that the rights and interest combined were very high, while the shorts believed that in the current turbulent situation, the more time that passed, the more problems would arise. Each side had its own reasonable justification, so opinions differed and bulls and bears were evenly matched, with drastic changes possible in the future. Foreign banks are gradually seeing more withdrawals of deposits, and the situation in Shanghai is becoming more troubled. Prices rose several times, but high prices failed to hold. The market opened several jiao higher yesterday morning, and Class C even broke out of four yuan. Xin Fu, Yi Tai, Ren Chang bought in, while Po Chang Lian, Hong Da sold heavily. The noon close was up several jiao. In the afternoon, Class C was as high as nearly five yuan, more than five yuan higher than the lowest price, so sellers rushed in again. Lian Yi and Hong Da continued to sell, and bulls such as Xin Chang and Yi Chang also cut their positions. Xin Fu sold on one side and bought on the other. Lian He, Xin Hua, Hu He Ji, Zhong Fu, and others were still driving the price up, slightly better than the morning. The result was another increase of eight jiao to one yuan and six jiao, with a total turnover of two million yuan. A simple table is shown below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: Fifty shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 91.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation in the public utility stock market remains uncertain. In the afternoon, the selling pressure increased as the foreign exchange market eased, and many stocks reached new lows. Jardine Matheson fell the most sharply, with a high of 86.5 yuan and a closing price down to 78.5 yuan. The volume of trading in each stock was extremely large, and rubber stocks were also suppressed.</p>
<h3>Headline: Piece Goods, Cloth Also Changes Greatly</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market fell sharply yesterday with minor rebounds. The market was unsettled. The morning opening saw sharp drops in cotton yarn, and cloth selling also changed greatly. Fine Fugui cloth fell from 38 yuan 7 jiao and a half on the previous day to 36 yuan. Fine Fugui twill fell from 32 yuan and 5 jiao to 30 yuan and 5 jiao. The afternoon market rebounded five jiao to one yuan. As a result, the price of fine cloth and twill was still down one to two yuan per bolt, and the price of coarse cloth was down five jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about one yuan per bolt. More than 200 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants traded more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, the Fujian and Guangdong merchants traded 100+ pieces of bleached and dyed cloths, and twill cloths, and the Northern Road, Yanjing merchants traded 50-60 pieces of coarse and colored cloth. On the 19th, 585 packages of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Environment—everyone's "amulet," to manage things by environment; to handle things by environment; to conduct things by environment... It's not just about "protecting oneself by being wise," but also getting a "grand and upright" reputation. If one can have both fish and bear paws, who would be so foolish as to "stand firm"?</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai was the place where everything "became popular" the fastest: red socks turned into bare feet, long cheongsams turned into short cheongsams, and "nail polish" moved from fingers to toes... Now that the "environment has deteriorated," it is no wonder that there is a chorus of talk about "environment."</p>
<p>Drinking champagne and playing with women are all for the sake of the "environment"; running to gambling dens and going to dance halls are for the sake of the "environment"; hoarding, manipulating, and profiteering are also for the sake of the "environment"...</p>
<p>These are all "small things" and "not worth mentioning"; what we cannot but say is something else.</p>
<p>What is that "something else"?... (Due to the "environment," excuse me for not speaking plainly!)</p>
<p>However, one may as well say something that probably does not involve the "environment": "Don't use the environment as a band-aid or a rope!"</p>
<h3>Records of Examinations Available at Any Time</h3>
<p>— Chun Xiao</p>
<p>My younger cousin just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside, wanting to apply for school because he couldn't focus on studying in the village. He doesn't have any other relatives or friends in Shanghai, and even if he did, they wouldn't know how to apply for school, so I'm temporarily acting as his representative with full authority.</p>
<p>But he arrived a bit late. Almost all the schools have already held their entrance exams, and some have even started classes. Looking through the newspapers, there are still a few schools advertising for enrollment, even saying examinations were available at any time. This seems like a special consideration for students coming from afar. Isn't this my cousin's lucky break?</p>
<p>I rushed to a school with him, asked the doorman for a prospectus, and saw that the subjects to be tested were quite easy. The tuition wasn't particularly cheap, but because it was relatively close to home, we registered. I casually asked, "Can certificates exempt him from the exam?"</p>
<p>"That won't work. Here, everyone, whether they have certificates or not, must pass the entrance exam to avoid uneven levels in the future," said a gentleman whose position I couldn't quite discern. I thought, "Fortunately, the education in any school here is better than in the countryside. My cousin should be able to handle it."</p>
<p>The next morning, I accompanied my cousin to the exam. We first went to the academic affairs office, presented the admission ticket, and received the test paper. A tea boy led us to the examination hall, where many people were already ahead of us. At first, I thought they were all students taking the exam, but to my surprise, they were all "proctors." Counting the number of actual students, there were only six of us, including my cousin. Nobody knew who the proctor was.</p>
<p>They were quite clever. One person taking the exam was accompanied by four or five proctors. For example, during the English exam, someone good at English would help; during the arithmetic exam, someone good at arithmetic would help. They were truly a pool of talent. Passing was naturally within expectations. You could say it was the result of their total mobilization.</p>
<p>One of the older ones even complained that being in the same place with so many eyes and ears was a bit inconvenient. Unable to "pass" answers smoothly, he actually slipped the paper into his sleeve and went outside. In reality, there was no need to go to such lengths. We were all in the same "boat." Everyone understood tacitly.</p>
<p>Those without proctors were extremely unlucky. When they couldn't figure out the answers, they could only bite their penholders, erase with their erasers, and stare blankly, hoping someone would pass them an answer, but nobody paid them any attention. Luckily, my cousin had a flash of inspiration and pulled someone else's paper in front of him, starting to act like "Teng Wengong."</p>
<p>Originally, a middle school entrance exam should take a whole day, with lunch provided. Now, with examinations available at any time, the exam was over as soon as it was finished. The two-dollar registration fee, was it cheap, or was it expensive?</p>
<p>Since it was still early when the exam ended, we took a stroll around the school. We ran into my cousin's classmate who came to pay the fees. He said someone inside introduced him, so he didn't have to take the entrance exam.</p>
<p>As we slowly walked out of the school gate, we happened to run into my old classmate. After exchanging greetings, I learned that he worked at the school, so I asked him to help my cousin. He patted me on the shoulder and laughed, "You're too honest. Everything in Shanghai is like this. What does the entrance exam matter? It's just for show, to fool the simple-minded. In front of strangers, who would reveal their secrets? Everyone is on the inside, and we all understand. If you don't believe me, check the list tomorrow, and you'll see. See you tomorrow, see you tomorrow." After saying that, he went into the school gate.</p>
<p>The next morning, I rushed over to take a look. Sure enough, there were names on the list, everyone was accepted. So that's what "examinations available at any time" meant. It's a pity that my cousin can only put up with it there for one semester!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Secondly, her father thought of a classmate's kindness, wanting to introduce her to his older brother, promising to provide financial support for her education and cover the family's living expenses as conditions. At that time, she felt it was a significant insult, or at the very least, a ridiculous joke. But now, looking at the family's situation and the suffering of her father and mother, she couldn't help but feel a little regretful. Women were meant to marry anyway. If she could benefit her whole family through her marriage, then even if it came with some passive nature, there was no reason to curse it.</p>
<p>"If your brother's illness isn't treated quickly, there will be no hope!" Her mother's words kept ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>Her brother was her father's only son and the best companion she had from childhood to now. The day he went to Hangzhou to recuperate, Xiangqi cried for three or four hours straight and didn't even eat dinner. If this only sibling of hers were to leave and never return, there would be an eternal, unfillable scar in her heart!</p>
<p>"If only Principal Hou could find a position for me, then I could get an advance on half a year's salary and send it to my brother for medical expenses... I wonder how the talks with Dad went today...?" Xiangqi thought to herself incessantly.</p>
<p>Her father finally returned, covered in sweat, looking very excited. But within that excitement, there was also a very peculiar expression.</p>
<p>"Dad, did the principal find a job for me?" Before Mr. Luo even entered the house, she couldn't wait to ask. But strangely, she asked three times, and her father still didn't answer. Finally, he said vaguely,</p>
<p>"I'll tell you later!"</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Luo used some excuse to send Xiangqi back to her room and then had a secret conversation with his wife, as if discussing important military matters. (34)</p>
<h3>The Scum of Life</h3>

<h3>Inside the Small Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>— Mang Bei</p>
<p>It's drizzling, and the weather has turned cold again.</p>
<p>As someone who's always busy with something, I stepped onto the muddy stone road early in the morning to go to the "wild chicken small vegetable market" behind the back door, aiming to snag some "cheap deals."</p>
<p>The clamor of the small vegetable market won't quiet down just because of the gloomy weather; on the contrary, the noise on a rainy day is especially disturbing.</p>
<p>"Thief! Catch the thief!" Suddenly, a sharp and urgent cry from a woman broke through the noise not far away!</p>
<p>As a result, people all cast horrified glances in that direction, with at least a hint of schadenfreude in their eyes.</p>
<p>Following the sound, a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old "little rascal" was running over here, still constantly chewing on a fried dough stick in his mouth…</p>
<p>"So that's what happened!"</p>
<p>As if seeing just another very ordinary thing, everyone's face was piled with a peaceful smile, and some even cast a glance of sympathy at the "little rascal"!</p>
<p>"In these times, things are so expensive, if you don't eat, aren't you just waiting to die? When you're starving, you naturally have to steal!" A middle-aged man who seemed "worldly wise" mumbled this way.</p>
<p>The market sounds clamored again…</p>
<p>Splashing in the muddy water, I wandered… and stopped by a beef stall.</p>
<p>One dollar and thirty cents a pound. An elderly lady was counting the change she received; a large chunk of bright red beef lay in her vegetable basket. The vegetable basket was hanging on her arm…</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was attracted by the furtive expression of someone standing behind her (also a "rascal"). Sure enough, as expected, like a cat catching a mouse, in a few seconds, that piece of beef was in his hand, and he ran off!</p>
<p>I didn't shout; because it was "someone else's business." Moreover, what does it matter if someone who can afford beef steals it?</p>
<p>But in order to "avoid suspicion," I also made a quick exit.</p>
<p>Further down, it was all vegetables and the like… Another dispute arose.</p>
<p>"Green vegetables! One and a half yuan per jin? I've never eaten them so expensive!"</p>
<p>Really, I've never even heard of it.</p>
<p>"Do you know how much rice sells for per dan now?"</p>
<p>Also true, the price of rice exceeded one hundred yuan!</p>
<p>"Humph! If rice is expensive, vegetables should be even cheaper."</p>
<p>I don't know what the reasoning is; but thinking about it, it's quite right.</p>
<p>"If vegetables are cheap, are we not supposed to eat rice?"</p>
<p>All true! But I didn't interrupt; because this was "someone else's business" again.</p>
<p>Wandering… The raindrops got bigger. The result was that I didn't manage to snag any "cheap deals"!</p>
<p>Those buying vegetables hurriedly set off on their way home: some had fish and meat in their baskets, and they were also carrying a chicken; but some had only a lonely bunch of "snow cabbage" lying in their baskets!</p>
<p>The small vegetable market – a microcosm of the city!</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"That Uncertain Feeling"</h3>
<p>— Deng Shiying</p>
<p>Last year, Hollywood frantically produced a large number of so-called "screwball comedies." Among the ones we have seen and can still remember, there are "The Awful Truth" and "My Favorite Wife," etc. "That Uncertain Feeling," which is now being shown at the Dahua Theater, also belongs to this category.</p>
<p>The production time of "That Uncertain Feeling" was roughly also during this "frenzy," but its achievements are far inferior to "The Awful Truth." These so-called "screwball comedies" don't even talk about "consciousness," and maybe we went to see them without that intention in the first place, just to kill two hours. — So, how is "That Uncertain Feeling?"</p>
<p>Looking at the "cast list," this is Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas' "first collaboration." Myrna Loy is William Powell's "old partner," and for acting in comedies, if we don't say she's "good at it," we can at least say she's "experienced." Douglas, on the other hand, seems to be quite popular among Chinese audiences recently. The "The Awful Truth" mentioned above has his participation.</p>
<p>However, their "first collaboration," "That Uncertain Feeling," is not satisfactory. The responsibility should not be borne by them, and most of the reason lies in the script and the director.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that the plot of this "screwball comedy" is too "serious" and "arbitrary," because this is the "consistent style" of American comedies. Without this, there is no way to "be happy." If you want to be satisfied from this, it is your own hopes that are too high, and it also goes against your original intention of "killing time." What you may not be satisfied with is that the "happiness" in this "screwball comedy" is mostly in the dialogue and not "visualized" enough, so you feel it's not exciting enough. Of course, if you have a better understanding of the dialogue, then you will like it comparatively more.</p>
<p>The director's failure to develop the play and make it "happy" may be due to the limitations of the script, but the lack of brisk melody and the lack of strong climax (that is, the scene where Jeff returns home and Margie's attitude changes) is still due to the director. Among the three films that Dahua has shown consecutively recently ("New Moon," "Arise, My Love," and this "That Uncertain Feeling" all come from the same director), the best one should be "Arise, My Love." I think directing this kind of play is more in line with his style.</p>

<p>The drama group of the New Art Troupe held a round table meeting the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, preparing to perform in the near future. The play has not yet been decided, and the location is also yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Li Wen, a young actor who went to Ningbo with Sui Yulian's troupe, is still singing at the Minguang Theater. He wrote to the reporter to report that the business performance is very good, so he does not want to return to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
