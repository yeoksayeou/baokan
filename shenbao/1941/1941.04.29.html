<p>社评</p>
<h3>援华与苏联</h3>
<p>美國的輿論，是政治源泉，是憲法條文以外的國家最高權所寄；而輿論的成熟，由於正反兩面的激盪消長，以迄融和混一，由於空間與時間相乘而爲總積。羅斯福氏以總統主政，已閱九年，『民猶是也，國猶是也』，然而目前儘量援助英國作戰的辦法，在去年今日尙不能想像，這決不因爲今年與去年有何政策的不同，人事的不同；却因去年正在正反兩面激盪中，消長中，未融和，未混一，而今年今日則成熟了。關於援助中國原來很少强烈的反對，問題重在態度的冷熱，質量的重輕，時機的緩急；而其趨勢所顯示的，乃爲由冷漸熱，由輕漸重，由緩漸急；援華運動的空間正在擴展中，時間正在推移中；不久的將來，行見援華援英同等待遇的輿論之成熟。以中英同等待遇，爲目標的援華運動，在最近三四個月以來，方以大速率高昂着。在前晚，美國前任駐法大使貝立德氏，對許多著名人士演說，促成對華對英的等量支援，是根據了事實的雄辯，熱情充溢，必能使這一運動加速的蔚爲成熟的輿論。尤堪欣慰者：美國貸華平準基金美幣五千萬圓，英國貸華平準基金英幣五百萬鎊，合上海匯價的共法幣十九萬萬圓之；鉅協定纔經簽字確立，或使各方震駭於此鉅數，或使各方滿足於此厚援：而貝立德氏演說却在貸款協定簽字之後，這最足以表示如此鉅數厚援，在埋解遠東問題嚴重性的人們，在理解中國作戰價値的人們，在理解中國作戰直接有關美國福利的人們，不以此厚援爲止境，不以此鉅數爲滿足。若此見解，應該不僅是中國人士所忻慰。</p>
<p>貝立德氏演說之中，有不少警惕之辭，如謂「吾人（美國）之所以未嘗遭受德義日攻擊之唯一理由，厥爲彼輩尙無餘力及於吾人；英國令德義在歐洲不得分身，而日本亦同樣爲中國所困；中國促令日本精疲力竭，其予英美之協助，實較吾人所已協助中國者爲尤大；中國爲吾人之安全而作戰，原不亞於英國也」；這些说說明，無不準確而犀利。由此而論因果，論权利義務的公尤，論中英兩国所遭惨痛與所任艱鉅，論美國對中英两國的休戚攸共，痛癢相關，必然的，得到結論，斷言於美國必須，抑且亟須，以援英的形式，援助中國，對中國所需，予以接濟。貝氏演說亦頗往重蘇聯，他以爲蘇日兩國最近簽訂的中立條的，是兩國成爲盜匪兄弟，以分割中國；又以爲中國希望之一，乃爲蘇聯終將以有效的軍事援助，給予中國，以禦日本，華人現已知此希望歸淤幻滅矣；彼等且懼蘇聯目前對華的少許接濟，或將因希特勒的命令而竟斷絕。這種見解得从彼所谓『共產黨国家爲一切生活在自由中的人類之敵』，獲知其成見與源流。成見所在，源流所自，我們不必贅贊一辭；却亦得此機會，申述我們不同的觀察：即日蘇簽訂中立條的的結果，確是部分的說明了蘇聯不會以有效的軍事援助，給予中國，抵禦日本；但我們觀察所得，一以為中國方面自始沒有希望蘇聯爲了中國而與日本作軍事的周旋，故現在不能視為中國這一種希望的幻滅；二以為蘇日之澗的矛盾之存在，不因中立條的而消弭，問題祗在蘇聯究竟是否有這一天，爲了他自己而與日本作軍事的周旋。至於蘇聯對中國的援助，其是否繼續？不繁於日本的企冀，而繫淤蘇聯所感受德國或日本的威脅，執强執弱，執為蘇聯所克勝，孰爲蘇聯所受不了。其是何數量？不繫於中國的需要，而繫於蘇聯所多餘的力量。其是否一反故常而分割中國？不繫於蘇日兩國的劃策，而繫於中國作戰圖存，自力更生的成敗；不繫蘇日兩國目前的欲念衝動，而繫於蘇聯方面恒久的利害關係。關於蘇聯，英美方面懷有牢不可破的異感者，夙多其人，貝立德氏殆爲其中之一，而爲我人所不欲苟同；然我人殷願向貝立德氏以及觀感司於貝氏的若干英美人士更進一言。蘇聯在歐洲，如何進止，如何友敵，姑弗輕事論列；在遠東，局勢似混沌而其實簡單，似紊亂而其實一貫，蓋遠東前途以中國之興替盛衰爲唯一的決定因素；離了中國問題，殆無所謂遠東問題；除了中國以外的各國，將來在遠東發言力量的强弱，則端視目前各國支援中國的多寡而分。無論如何演變，這是必然而微妙的公式！</p>
<h3>蔣夫人對英廣播稱　英國為民治主義而戰　目前雖暫過挫折終必獲最後勝利</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國廣播公司昨夜轉播蔣夫人播昔演說、表明中國人民對英國民衆之同情與欽佩、略謂、英人如中國人民然、芷爲民治主義而戰、茲有可爲英國吿者、任何軍隊不能每戰必勝、或到處得利、英國長此民氣無損、民心健旺、而具有爲自由賡續作戰之必耍條件、則必獲最後勝利云、蔣夫人並籲請英國企盼捐助央人所辦之在華賑災基金、謂英國所予之援助、中國人民、永矢不忘、中國作戰四年、難民達五六千萬人云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　英國廣播公司「B．B．C．特請蔣委員長夫人、於二十八日上午二時四十分、對英用英語廣播演講、由該公司以二十日電台用中波及長波轉播全國、並於三時四十五分、用短波向全世界報吿、蔣夫人講詞內容、英國廣播公司邀請我國重要人氏演講、此次尙屬創舉、該公司爲求收音淸晰計、特請蔣夫人於四月二十晨二時、預先播講、該公司在倫敦收錄留音片、蓋恐臨時收音不淸、如此則有時間得從容複播校正、足見其對此舉之鄭重、蔣夫人於二十日在重慶國際廣播電台播音後、即得倫敦來電、謂收音成績十分滿意、茲將蔣夫人廣播詞譯稿紀錄如下、</p>
<p>英國的朋友們、在我們對日本作戰的過程中、你們給與我中國以同情與援助、我今天得有機會向諸位發表電話、且略申我全國同胞感謝的悃忱、實在覺得欣幸、救濟中國災難的英國捐款、從前稱爲「梅易爵士救濟金」、這種援助、一向鼓勵了我們爭取自由的戰鬥、我們知道英國也在艱苦地從事於生死的搏鬥、可是英國人士仍舊盡力之所及、繼續支援着我們、我們中國人歷來是受惠勿忘的民族、對於英國這種友誼的表示、自然永遠不會忘記、今天的我廣播的講題是關於我幽的</p>
<p>救濟事業　四年來的戰爭、使五六千萬的中國同胞、成了難民、其中一部份、已經暫時得到安頓、一部分仍舊流離失所、非至戰事結束、得不到安定的生活、可是他們寗願忍受目下這種困厄與艱辛、絕不願受日人統治、日機一再轟炸我們後方不設防的城市村鎭、以去年六月間的重慶來說、兩天的運續空襲、就使七萬市民無家可歸，整個夏季中、天氣晴朗的白天、月光淸明的夜晚、日本飛機是沒有不來轟炸的、到冬天、重慶祗剩了頽型殘礎、一片荒凉、但今天你若</p>
<p>到重慶來　看一看、你知道你會得到什麽樣的印象、臨時性質的簡易房屋、其興建之速、有如雨後春笋、這如何可能、因爲中國精神不知道有失敗兩字、那些商人們、在日人投彈縱火的地方、不待烟消灰冷、就把牠經營建築起小屋來、重整舊　、有許多組織、如新生活運動會、敎會團體、以及各種合作社、在政府的領導之下、幫助被災的市民、成績非常優良、我們並不把被災同胞視爲憐憫的對象、但覺得他們是値得尊敬的、愛國國民是生產事業中的活躍分子、賑濟委員曾經營着十七個手工藝、及輕工業的工廠、並且積極推行若于</p>
<p>开墾计劃　已有一八十三萬的難民、安排在墾荒工作之上、一九三八年日人炸毀了黃河的大岸、葬送了二十幾萬同胞的生命、現在也正有許多難民從事於修堤的工作、戰事爆發之初、我國祗有六千名註冊醫師、軍隊裹　就至少需要五萬名軍醫、醫藥用品也同樣感到供求相差的　殊、所以英國朋友們、由國際紅十字會及中國紅十字會、所供給我們的醫生與醫藥器材，我軍民雙方都受到無量的利益、到這裏　我要順便提一下我國婦女對於作戰的重要貢獻、中國婦女慰勞總會、四年來募集的醫藥用品及醫藥救濟金、不下</p>
<p>五千萬元　前綫及後方醫院的工作人員多數是自動義務參加的、他們欣然犧牲了生活的舒適、爲國家服務、我們從戰區救出的二萬五千名難童、也正施以敎養、希望他們在慈祥的保育之下、漸漸忘記過去的慘痛經騐、恢復他們在兒童時代應有的快樂和天眞、如果我們有充足的工具與設備、也許所救援的難童還不止此數、我最後還有一句話、世界上沒有每戰必勝的軍隊、也沒有每地必勝的軍隊、紙要一國的士氣不衰、人民的意志不搖、一定能獲得</p>
<p>最後勝利　你們可以斷然的相信，在正義尙木重申之日、中國決不會放下他的武器來、祇要如此、我們就可以吿慰那些作崇高犧牲的同志們的英靈、我希望你們能感覺到我們的奮鬥與英國的奮鬥、精神上事實上都爲了同一的目標、因爲我們四年來親身體騐、所以我們同情你們目前的苦難、比任何民族都要更深切、爲民主主義英勇奮鬥的英國朋友們、我們中國對於你們謹表無限的同情、無限的欽敬、（二十八日電）</p>

<h3>邱吉爾廣播演詞　重申英作戰決心　對局勢發展毋庸驚擾　以穩定目光應付困難　地中海新危機或將延及西土蘇</h3>
<p>倫敦　英首相邱吉爾（見圖）昨夜對英國各處廣播演詞、重申英國人民非勝即死之莫可變更的決心、勸聽衆勿因歐·非兩洲目前之發展遞自驚擾失措、並陳述英國不得不決定派軍按助希臘之理山、邱吉爾於此演詞中、對於英國人民在德機猛烈空襲下之舉動、備致譽揚、而對於美國巡邏西半球海面之決定、亦表示欣感、</p>
<p>出發視察如登舵樓</p>
<p>邱吉爾演詞謂、上星期有詢余知否民間因戰局嚴重稍感不寗者、余爲親自視察民間惶擾究達何種程度起見、乃赴被炸最烈之若干城鎭與海港及貧民最受苦區域、今余歸來、不獨心定神安、且亦精神格外煥發、余離政務叢集終日無暇之相邸辦公室、而入倫敦·利物浦·曼却斯特·迦狄夫與斯文細等處之街衢、與碼頭、無異離悶熱之室而登戰艦之舵樓、此乃一服袖劑、余願勸凡疲煩而須進補者、宜服之、蓋民間精神激昂、直使人類超越於物質事實水準以上、而入於似非目前世界所有之恬靜境界、余見而爲之愉快也、吾國數百年來海·陸戰士所保持之戰塲經騐與情緒、今全國人民亦皆有之、不分男女不論老弱、無一不在敵人砲火之下、如戰士然、彼等自以得與戰士向列火綫奮戰到底爲榮、一言以蔽之、英國人民抱定非勝即死之決心、此誠吾人歷史中最英勇之時期、光榮無限、諸君於此可想像余感覺余之責任如何深刻矣、余對國人之資任在　職、使國人安然渡過今所遭之艱苦難關云、</p>
<p>援助希臘乃保榮譽</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼言及戰事、謂在里比亞使義軍大多數盡成俘虜之　軍、爲數甚微、此點世人鮮有知之者、華維爾將軍在其屢次勝利中、從未有一次用兵多逾二師或三萬人者、當英軍進抵班加齊後、吾人接有礙難謝絕之召喚、去年十一月、義軍未加警吿、遞即進攻希臘、希臘眾奮其英武、擊潰義軍、希特勒潛自布置決定助凶、巴爾幹諸國缺乏團結、使希特勒得集軍於巴爾幹中部、當希臘軍正痛擊義軍之際、德軍竟秉隙進犯希臘邊境、希臘受此威脅乞助於吾人、吾人力量固已緊張、但對此召喚不能不應、希臘人本有言、如鄰國不爲助、而英國不予援、則彼等將自力奮鬥、然吾英人不能視若無視、否則傷及英帝國之榮譽、苟失此榮譽、吾人何能希望或値得勝利乎、勝負不常、時有變化、故軍事動作或計算錯誤皆可補救、但可羞、可恥之行爲、則將使吾人喪失其刻在世界所享之尊榮、並將摧毀吾人力量之要素、</p>
<p>德方宣傳離間英澳</p>
<p>吾人在過去一年中、巳以吾八之動作、傳得美國人民從來未有之好感、余敢謂美國之行動、不取決於得失之計算、但取決由人生基礎而起之高尙道德情緒、吾人不得不盡吾人有限之力量、以應希臘之呼籲、吾人會商諸澳洲與紐西蘭、而該兩政府毫無猶豫聲明同意、於是尼羅江一部份重要流動陸軍、乃遣往希臘、以踐吾人之諾言、當時可徵調最適宜此役之軍隊、厥爲來自澳洲與紐西蘭者、而自英國出發參加此役者僅及其半、今德國宣傳、極力離間英·澳、指吾人不願用英軍擔任此役、而使澳軍爲之、此種讕言、余將聽任澳洲自行應付之、吾人當然自知、吾人所能遺往希臘之軍力、不足以遏制德方侵略之在潮、但吾人當時確希望希臘鄰邦可因吾人之參戰、及時採取與希臘合作之立塲、至於此種希望之如何未克實現、他日自能知之、</p>
<p>義相誇勝可笑可恥</p>
<p>邱吉爾又言及南斯拉夫、謂「該國忠勇人民起而反抗希圖服從納粹治權忍辱偷生之政府、以救其國家之靈魂與前途、但時機已晚、不及保全其疆土、陸軍尙未動員、戰士尙未出發、而敵方機械化部隊已壓境矣、同時希臘軍以敵衆我寡勢力逈殊、不能抵禦、而在阿爾巴尼亞之勝利軍隊遂被迫繳械、巴爾幹旣發生此鉅變、澳洲軍等不得不一面拒戰、一面向海退却、報紙現載有義相墨索里尼賀其軍隊在希臘獲勝之文、此誠可笑可恥之事世界新紀錄也、當巴爾幹發生此可悲之事時、我軍之在里比亞者亦受使人煩慮之頓挫、此路德軍進行旣速、人數亦衆、出於我方將帥之預料、我方裝甲部隊前擊潰義軍者、不得不重行編配、而英方裝甲部隊一旅、初料力足扼守邊界、直至五月中旬者、亦不能不退、其所有車輛、大半爲優　的德方鐵甲軍所破壞、惟我軍仍堅守處於德軍側面之杜白魯克砲壘、已在該處屢創敵軍、並俘獲多人、此爲里比亞與埃及邊界戰事之近况、</p>
<p>非洲戰事將更激烈</p>
<p>吾人現必須期料、地中海與沙漠地及天空之戰事、將更激烈而廣遍、惟吾軍現已肅淸西列內加之義軍、今將掃蕩德軍、此事較難、且非一時所能　功、諸君皆知余絕不諱敗爲勝、余從未輕視德軍戰鬥力、數月前余曾謂我軍對義而得之迅速不斷的勝利順境、未必能賡續不已、不可不料及逆境、戰局中有一事可確定者、即戰事充滿失望與錯誤是、今德國之蹂躪巴爾幹諸國、而使德人與希臘、南斯拉夫人民間成立沭血與仇隙之鴻溝、是吾爲一大錯、將於日後見之、德國以其現所有之軍隊與供應品、作進犯埃及之常識、其是吾又鑄一錯、亦須俟他日知之、凡未作之戰爭、余輒不欲預言其勝負、但余敢言、如余見中東雙方軍隊互易其工作、而華維爾將軍所統之軍隊改　於德軍之地位、則余將甚不懌矣、此乃余之個人意見、余知或有觀察不同者、除埃及所受之威脅外、地中海殆必有新危機、戰事今後或將蔓延於西班牙與摩洛哥、且或延及士、美、德國或將伸手以攫取烏克蘭之糧庫與高加　之油井、直至垂涎裏海、又孰能言之、吾人唯有竭力應付之、敵到何處、吾人將在何處作戰、惟有一事確無疑義者、即希特勒無論在束方或中東或遠東、終不能逃脫公道之譴責是、希特勒欲達其勝利目的、非征服英國或切斷英、美交通綫不可、</p>
<p>全力應付大西洋戰</p>
<p>本年二月初、余發廣播演說時、許多人即以爲、納粹侵英之在言、行將開始、但侵英之舉、迄今未見實施、而我國之海、陸、空軍在人數配備戰力與訓練上、每隔一月即加强一分、今後可保障吾人島嶼、余以今日國內地位與去夏相比較時、余覺吾人可爲欣感、余信吾人苟不懈其努力、終能表示甚好成續、言之過甚、固屬誇張、而稍不自信、亦屬愚味、然則吾人大西洋中之生命結果如何乎、如裝載民生所賴的食物之船隻、多被擊沉、吾人將如何、如美國現擬運至英國之大宗戰具、途中被阻、吾人又將如何、希特勒二月間會發加緊潛艇與天空戰爭之威嚇言論、但吾人已採取各種可能的計畫、以應付此種攻擊、今猶如是、吾人現聚精會神以禦之、此即所謂大西洋大戰也、吾人欲生存、必獲此勝利、如吾人於去年八·九月間在天空戰爭中所爲者、吾人思及擊沉船隻何等容易、造成船隻何等困難時、吾人思及吾人有船行於海上者不下二千艘、而行於危險區者、亦不下三四百艘時、吾人思及吾人在近東所維持之大軍及保護吾人在世界之交通時、吾人當知負有致勝責任者、對於大西洋戰爭如何重視矣、</p>
<p>對美援助不勝欣慰</p>
<p>余聞美國總統與人民近所決定之大計、至爲欣慰、英可言喻、蓋美國艦隊與海上飛機、今已奉有巡邏西半球大海、以保護各國船隻之命令矣、美國朝野認英國作戰之理直、且知英國失敗、美國利益亦必受害之情形、故已作援英作戰之莊嚴諾言、美國今方出其資財、用其工業、輸其利器、以應英國需要、余知其定不願見其高尙舉動半途無效、而聽令其工廠出品沉沒海底也、德國所行之潛艇戰爭、遠反數年前德國所承認之國際協定、此非有效的封鎖、但爲屠殺而已、余確信大西洋戰爭雖長久而艱難、而其結果尙未決定、但現已入於更艱苦、但更可使人滿意之階段矣、美國此時已與吾人密切團結、而予吾人以精神上、物質上與海面上援助、觀於　、美民治國所宣布之決心。希特勒與墨索里尼之必歸失敗、毫無疑義、匈奴有衆不足七千萬、泰半已用於彈壓奧、捷等民族、英、美人民數及二萬萬、旣握海權、而在天空亦漸佔優勢、資財技能與夫鋼鐵又逈非德國所可及、決計不許自由受獨裁者之蹂躪、亦不許世界進步之潮流因此而反向、吾人對於歐、非、亞三大洲之發展、固不免煩慮、但無惶恐之理由、吾人必須以穩定之目光、應付當前之困難、今東方所發生者、其嚴重性遠不及吾人去年所遭遇者之甚、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>民治各國需要美國的軍火軍備，以飛機為主，尤其渴望美國以「飛行堡壘」相助。所謂飛行堡壘，就是一種碩大無朋的轟炸機，無異飛行的砲台，全身具備槍彈不入的防禦物，可以裝着大量炸彈飛往數千里外轟炸，破壞力的強大，　為普通轟炸機所望塵莫及。</p>
<p>美國以製造飛行堡壘著名的，有道格拉斯和波音爾，可與德國最厲害的俯衝轟炸機和梅塞斯密特式飛機相抗衡。但該廠在飛機製造史上最大的，要算是造成道格拉斯B.19式的超級轟炸機，就是所謂飛行堡壘了。這種飛機的製造工廠，道格拉斯廠是美國最大的商辦飛機場，在加州綠衫磯附近設有製造廠三所，雇用工人四萬名，乘造各式軍用飛機。其中如DB-7和SBD-1等機。</p>
<p>這種飛機的製造工程浩大，其第一架為美國陸軍部訂造，在開工前，至少打了各種不同的圖樣九千張。然後動員工程師技師機匠五百人，歷時四載，耗費二百萬美元，直至最近始行完成，公認為世界最大最有威力的轟炸機。。道格拉斯B19式飛行堡壘係用全金屬製造。骨架長一百三十二呎，兩翼長二百十二呎，機身高四十二呎九吋，儲油量一萬一千加侖，裝旋風式引擎四具，每具發動力等於一千匹馬力。着地橡皮輪盤，每枚直徑九十六吋，重二千七百磅。每小時最高速率、一百哩。機員十名，可以携带炸彈十八噸，飛程可達七千五百哩，換句話說，可以在火奴魯魯和東京間，或在紐約和歐洲間，來回飛行，不用停留。一次轟炸的力量，可以抵擋德國俯衝轟炸機三十六架。</p>
<p>道格拉斯B19式戰重機量八十噸至一百噸，不僅適於遠距離轟炸，且能運載士兵前往作戰地點，每次可載全副武裝的士兵一百二十五名。</p>
<p>但道格拉斯B19式製造費時，緩不濟急，故目下膾炙人口的「飛行堡壘」，都是波音式。這種飛機的威力也超出普通轟炸機好幾倍。</p>
<p>波音飛機廠設在西雅圖，係用大批製造方法，大量生產，供給本國與外國的迫切需要。該廠分為幾個主要部分。（一）打樣部，有專家五百人，每造一機，需總會各部圖樣五千五百張，面積達一萬八千五百七十八方呎。（二）分配部，該廠在同一時候，製造多架飛機，每架需用二萬九千六百個部分配合，故各部分須順序製造，及時應用。該部對於製造情形，有精密的統計，某號飛機的某某部份，尚未製造，正在製造或巳經完成，都可一目了然。（三）製造部，其中有鑄模場，壓製機彀機翼；有铰釘場，用電力鑽孔，鉸釘骨架機件；有電焊場，焊接全機所需各式鉛管五千四百呎；還有接綫部，裝置全機所需長短電綫一千四昏二十二段，長及三哩半。此外，還有原料部與包裝部等。</p>
<p>波音B17式轟炸機，機身長六十八呎，兩翼長一百呎以上，機身高十五呎二分之一。裝一千四百匹馬力引擎四具，兩側和尾端都有機關槍座。飛程可達三千至四千哩，每小時最高速率三百哩。機員七名至九名自英國飛往柏林轟炸回國後還可以續飛二千哩，或自英國飛往義大利南部或捷克斯科達兵工廠轟炸後一夜之間來回自如。</p>
<p>波音廠的製造的速率，在一年的約兩星期完成一架，現在約四天完成一架，不久可望兩天完成一架。美國陸軍部會向該廠訂造五百架,巳在陸續交貨，其中數十架且已由英田政府轉讓英國應用了。</p>

<h3>糧食　顧何為乎而訂新限價　抑又何為乎而撤銷</h3>
<p>既無善後辦法米價遂沖天而上　囤戶無所顧忌一日間漲十元許　較之限價時市價又高起二十元　洋米到五萬餘粳米亦漲五六元</p>
<p>昨日洋米因工部局又將限價公佈取消、亦無善後辫法、以是人心激昂、買氟愈濃、囤戶肆無忌憚、實銷幫如铺作散戶客幫內地鄉莊各戶趁機添辦外、新囤戶舆業外尤為活躍、大戶集體檳守抬價、浮戶放價爭買、市價即在一抬一放之下。頓見飛黄騰達、節節向上、漲風猛烈、竟難遏止、西買一號米開價一百三十六元半尚與上週六黑市貼價核合相近、繼即自一百三十七八九元至一百四十元、再加一元二元、至一百四十五元收市、午後非正式交易依然活潑、行情再度喊高二一三元不等、結果比之上週末較漲四五元八九元不等、英華司原包亦見活躍異常、小絞現貨一百六十二元、期貨一百五十三元、碎米路一百三十元、期貨一百廿八元一百廿九元至一百廿九元半、　米一百三十元、成交不下二千噸、現货三萬多包、新交易計有合義五月上期小絞六百噸、價一百五十六元二角、總之、限價如大腹賈肚皮、放一回、寬一回、大眾的肚皮、則阻一次、癟一次、</p>
<p>洋米大量到滬、太古公司　陽輪、上星期六（廿六）到埠，由香港裝來洋米一萬零八百包、北海輸同曰到滬、亦由香港運來洋米八千三百三十七包，江蘇輪二十七日抵埠、由查港裝來洋米一萬零四百九十包、太原輸亦二十七日到滬、香港裝來洋米四千四百零七包、甘州亦二十七日到埠、亦由香港運來洋米五百包、恰和洋行明生輸亦於前日（十七）抵滬、由香港装來洋米一萬七千一百十二包、連續共到六輪、運來洋米共有五萬六千五百四十六包之鉅、洋米大量不斷而來、米價接連上漲、此種景象失却情理之常、究不知要放任到如何地步、纔肯為大眾民文着想、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨既稀、而市盤相別巳與洋米並肩、致店銷認為較廉、納　頗濃、同時貨見洋米一再奔騰、售心亦堅、在雙重環境之下、厚薄兩粳行情悉升五六元之巨、計開崑錫高粳百四十元、次百三十八元，青角斛見薄稻百三十六元、次至百三十二三元、　　　　糯米際斯各貨一致飛漲之間、不獨飯担及糕鋪零星去路頗暢、且有大戶囤收、故售價相隨見昂、惟不若國洋兩米之出色、增高三四元耳、計開香港白元百廿四万元、糯茶百十八元、</p>
<h3>粉市初平後堅　平寶粉有停供說</h3>
<p>麵紛　初平後堅、上午開盤、局勢尚平、因本客實銷、未見熟烈、貨主亦不亟於求脫、金龍牌坎粉做開一千餘包、價為州元零四角、及花烏牌澳粉五百包、價三十一元、惟本廠平賣粉至昨日止、因原料不敷、暫停供給、下月份起再定數量與價格、更兼米價猛漲、人心頓時激起、故後市售價巳喊價三四角、執貨者莫不扳守居奇、故交易反見擯持、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易清淡如恆、杜麥已屆落令、內地到貨堪稱絕跡、市面供源早已中斷、故買賣無形停噸、開日廠門市、亦屬無貨可收、</p>
<h3>限價開放　油餅尚無劇變</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市場中之限價、租界當局亦放棄、故交易狀况尚見熱鬧、計開生油二百五十件、廠油一百担、大連油一百桶、各種黃豆二干餘包、苞米現貨三千餘包、期貨三四百噸、期現豆餅三萬餘片、但市價雖在人心受良機鼓勵下、大半均超出限價外、然其潛勢因實銷有限、　面上籌碼尤充溢、不免活動氣息窒碍、所以預測前途、恐不若米市之横衡　跳、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙有鉅額結款　洋米煤油與棉花</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌九點半揭蹺、美金回長〇六二五、計五一元二一五、吕．荷．三滙隨長、法．德無市、餘滙均勿更、暗市英美滙先鬆後回、蓋初因中英美基金協定簽字、未免引起賣風、投機家首來塞出、美商等外銀行均有賷意、美金最硬五元二一八七五可結、九點半左右、忽聞進口米．油．棉花等洋行來力扒、投機家亦轉納、止鬆頓步聚至午刻、軟至五元一五六二五、但不久即回平、下午投機家又扒不止、華行東亞又售美金十萬元、英行有利亦售出、局勢尚穩、終僅五月美金軋緊〇三一二五、計五元一五六二五、現貨及英金期現貨均軋平、交易頗旺、</p>

<p>收盤稍見回平</p>
<p>下午金價步漲不已、故各投機家進東亞五月美金五元一八七五十萬美元、後即難結、有利出華行四月五元一八七五、現貨亦會軟至照上價難結、但不久即回平、四點收市、現貨至五月期英匯均三辦士一八七五、美金現貨與四月均五元一八七五、五月期五元一五六二五、比上週六午收、僅五月美金緊〇三一二五、餘反英滙現期貨均軋平云、</p>

<p>外幣市況平疲</p>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價起落不定、英美金鎊因亦漲後回平、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票變動仍小、終比上週漲起九分、香港票漲後回落、終小一分、此外如新加坡、安南、菲列濱等票均稍趨漲、日金票跌後回平、晚市仍站二元一角原盤、朝鮮票供給較旺、市價略軟、晚市退為一元八角三分、</p>
<h3>四行復業　金市反見高升　游資充斥紛購現金以收藏</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、跌後突然步漲、價已越出六千七百元大關外、各方人心因四行正式復業、已大見安定、但游資　感充沛、扒外滙、購現金者踴躍、故於農開後為外行多頭斬結、一見六千六百四十五元低價後、不久聞外滙在投機扒風中步緊、更有洋行結款、激動買風、各金號舆證券幫紛起收吸、散空急補、午刻上升更速、躍出六干七百元外、下午某錢莊力進、升至六千七百三十元、經滙票商套出、回低二十元、終見軋升三十七元、全日交易頗旺、共約三萬兩左右、掉期（四月轉入五月)賣方成記貼出予永成八十兩、貼價四十元、己見回低十元、現金步高尤速、乃游賽充斥、收買力驟强也、益大售予德孚三十兩、價照期交高一百五十元、永豐餘出中與一百數十兩、高一百五十五元、金號出錢莊五十兩、高一百六士元、午刻高一百七十元、有買戶、下午成記售予順源及德成各一百兩、價高一百六十元、約軋升五十元、首飾金反跌為漲、終軋升五元、計七百十元、關金等均平云、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲卅七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市為六千六百五十元、比上週六午收價低二十五元、乃四行復業、為多方出籠壓下也、次見六千六百四十五元、忽聞美金由鬆回平、五元二一八七五難結、人心一振、成記、大豐來力進、抬至六千六百七十元左右、詎至十點後、義元、仁承永、益大、熾大、德孚均來收吸、抬至六千六百九十元左右、又起盤旋、乃新豐永力售、德孚時來復出也、十一點後、美金五元一八七五難結、散戶爭進益切、時和進三百數十兩、提上至六千七百十三元、德大、成記、新豐永於午刻售小至六干七百元、年收六千七百零三元、下午二點開市耶抬上至六千七百十五元、此午收高十二元、散戶售小至六千七百零五元、益大、大豐來進、美金帶軟、價遂步升、由順源力進抬至六千七百三十元、滙票商新豐永與聚豐永、證券幫銀號吐出、當見整小至六千七百零八元、四點收市六千七百十二元、此上週六午收升三十七元、照五月美金五元一五六二五結價、為六千七百五十四元、計撳四十二元、全日有八十五元上落、現金號之本牌余售價此蛤赤期交價商一百八十元、收進此售出低八十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>證券　債市又見恍惚</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日開盤即見趨疲、中中交農四行確於昨晨復業、因公債市場於上週六即知此消息、做多者一再加碼、致胃量巳感满足、秉四行彼業後高價出籠、因此市價反覺不振、而致回小數角、人心又見懈怠、上午初開即小、同康鸿大生興協康協與元大華紛紛賣出、順昌進胃尚健、恰泰恒孚生大久孚亦有需要、仍見抬托乏力、午收即小二三角、午後同康仍有出脫恊康五和賣出亦多、益昌信明及鸿大均在求售、場內鑫豐恰泰順昌久豐長康永康敦餘及恒康或補空或做　多少不等、均有買進、　面仍係供過於求、甲丙種均打破四元、戊丁種均打破三元、乙種亦會破入六元、趨勢未見穩定、結果一致跌落四角半至七角半、成交約二百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>眾業股市開盤續漲、　轉恍惚、高價終不克維持、收盤趨勢尚穩、有多種著名股、昨為「除息」價、此點應毋與上週五收價混淆、橡皮股潛勢雖堅、不甚活潑、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬專做投機　隨金市而稍昂　雜紗出路甚艱</h3>
<p>紗市由低轉昂、但實際地位、絕少進展、此因運輸艱難、足使容方不能活動、但多頭因紗廠受電氣節約問題、勢必减工，所以做多心思仍堅挺、然出路狹隘、兩相扯平、因之市態復入徘徊之途耳，二十支雙馬高價一千四百九十六元、低價一千四百八十元、午後初做一千四百九十二元，繼聞檩金續昂、又復上升至一千四百九十九兀，最後價為一千四百九十五六元、目前紗市、因人心隨檩金作伸縮、然現貨交易、寥似晨星、總之不是根本辦法、且除雙馬標準、踢來踢去外、其他紗牌、賣出較為困苦也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市場人氣和平、加之四行業已復業、投機力量較弱、首盤價為一千四百八十二元、少頃微漲至一千四百八十七元、此時天津幫、證券幫等一致賣出、又降至一千四百八十元、於是在八十三阳元之間、週旋多時、同時廣幫無交易、但繼後聞檩金回好、多頭往來拉提、互相叫喊、竟抬至一千四百九十六元、價格一高、盈利者出籠、空頭活躍、市盤向下、收盤價為一千四百九十二元、查半日間成交統計六千三百六十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一二〇　同行六、二〇〇</p>
<p>內地　四〇　統計六、三六〇</p>
<h3>棉花到貨尚湧　成交反形冷落</h3>
<p>現棉情况、冷落不堪、此因近來到貨擁擠、且貨主均已獲利求售心切、免得出棧租雜費、然邇來環境不良、紗價既不擬、銷路殊滯、廠家為電氣减省問題、勢必壓迫减工、對於原料更無辦意、所以市盤大有趣跌之慮耳、昨申新　與（前廣勤）二紗廠稍有辦粗絨共成交七百四十包、巴西花同豐進二百件、茲再分綠如左、</p>
<p>南太倉花二〇八　　　二四〇包送廠</p>
<p>火機花　二〇五又</p>
<p>火機花　二〇七申新二二〇〇包又</p>
<p>巴西花　三三〇同豐　二〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、仍因時局影響而不感興趣、但市况尚稱堅定、昨日除成交三四批小額巴西棉及印棉外、其餘未之聞也、紐約棉市、靜而堅、因買進及空頭抵補而漲、結果收盤價格較之上日漲二至八磅音不等、印度棉市、先因空頭抵補、及買方不斷支持漲、旋因投機者獲利售出抑平、但最後再因現貨商買進而漲、結果收盤價格、除白洛去四五月份漲九羅比、七八月份漲五羅比外、其餘各漲一羅比左右、又预測今日開盤市况、繼續看高半羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布為紗帶高</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢平、後市微挺、乃因布銷雖呆、而原紗突見回昂之故、售盤互有參差、白貨細布西料、回升每疋二角至五角、漂染布細沙綫織品價尤堅昂、業內外囤戶吸收較多、府綢　　等漲每疋三五角、本街成交各布六百餘件、粵港幫辦華豐藍布等貨一百餘件、國外新加坡等地辦漂布漂斜卡其等貨、六千餘疋東布實銷仍然平庸、故中檔細布漲勢乏力、惟業內外囤戶進胃不薄、高檔龍頭細布漲每疋四角、各牌細斜漲二角半至五角、四君子　　因四十二支細沙綫又見高盤、買戶湧躍籌碼大缺、猛升每碼二分外、下午收市價為一元五角五分半、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白復漲——近遠漲勢一樣</h3>
<p>昨糖市人心向榮、趨勢復又上展、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白開盤尚平、九十九元八角、未幾又躍出百元關外、做一百零一元至二元、升二元、月底大單、初為九十九元七角至一百元、一百元二角、一百零一元、一元半、二元一角、升二元一角、下月十日打單一百零一元七角至零二元、零二元半、三元、三元八角、收盤一百零三元五角、計升二元、太古車白B　一百零五元至一百零五元五角、隨升五角HX　東棧九十六元二角、荷赤計七十六元、本廠雪白一百零二元、晶明冰一百三十五元、二十八日有糖五千八百元自香港來、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤再升</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、昨市上大戶又起搜羅、而現貨枯竭、老單不多、致行情又出四百元大關、再見新高峯、喀爾喀答塊行拆喊四百二十五元、貨主尚不願出籠、煤屑三百六十元、本街門莊印度節塊每噸四百四十八元、下身煤屑三百八十元、祗解老交易、新戶不售云、</p>

<h3>中中交農四行　昨日已全部復業　各行門首警衛均極嚴密　市塲謠言全息人心大定</h3>
<p>中央·中國·交通·農民等四國家銀行上海分行、奉令於昨晨九時起、一律宜吿復業、自各該銀行昨日復業後、證實中國政府不論在何種環境下、決心繼續維持上海之金融、故連日外問各種無稽謠言、殆已不攻自破、茲誌詳情於後、</p>
<p>各分支行全部復業</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行亞爾培路上海分行、歸併於白克路辦事　營業、（二）中國銀行漢口路上海分行、暨八仙橋·同孚路·靜安寺·新閘路·各辦事處、及淪陷區各地撤退分支行駐滬辦事處及通訊處、全部復業、（三）交通銀行慕爾鳴路上海分行、暨南京路·靜安寺路·民國路·各支行及鎭區浙區分支行駐滬通訊處、完全復業、（四）中國農民銀行霞飛路上海分行、歸併於愛文義路辦事處營業、</p>
<p>武裝探捕保護週密</p>
<p>各該銀行於停業期間、對安全問題業經與租界當局定有方策、故昨日各行復業時、警務當局即派遣武裝探捕六名至十名、在各行門首戒備、對出入人等均施以嚴密檢査與盤詰、美軍防區各銀行、並有美軍十二名、派駐門首、甲區則爲萬國商團二名、皆手槍出盒、情形甚爲緊張、至開設法租界內者、亦有法越軍警多名保護、並有鐵甲車停駐門首、各銀行內衝要各處、並堆置沙袋加建鐵門、以策安全、</p>
<p>遇害行員各恤五萬</p>
<p>中國銀行副主任二名、前在中行別業門首被擊殞命後、該行當局以二人生前工作成績卓著、備極悼惜、業由重慶總行批准、各撥贈撫卹費五萬元、至住居中行別業之行員家屬百餘戶、大部均已遷出、現僅十餘家、尙居留其內、聞該宿舍業經轉租日方、至前被扣獲釋中國銀行職員、則已紛紛回行復職、照常辦公矣、</p>
<p>恢復收解維持四底</p>
<p>四行復業後、所有停業期內一切票據、統於復業之日補辦收解、同時銀行票據交換所錢業票據交換所、頃已恢復四行票據之交換、凡持有四行任何一行之票據、除得向各該行領取現款外、並得解與銀行轉賬、所以中外正當商人對四行之復業、均表無限之振奮、今四行能在滬各業四底結賬節以前復業、使整個金融穩定、各業得以週轉靈活、各商業銀行及滙劃莊得四行之調劑、得櫃續辦理貸放、使各業安渡此四底、</p>
<p>謠言全息人心安定</p>
<p>新聲社記者頃向金融市塲探悉、上海各投機市塲、前因四行停業、一般投　者散佈謠言、猛扒外滙搜羅黃金、以圖牟利、今因事實證明四行並未撤退、且已復業、於是市塲謠言全息、人心安定、黑市外匯放長、各項物價回降、因此人民生計、社會安寗、均受惠匪淺、惟盼望孤島人士嗣後切勿輕信無稽之謠、及勿作違背戰時金融政策之投機買賣、蓋投機買賣、非特爲法令所不許、且有碍民生、影響金融、</p>
<p>維持黑市外滙穩定</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行於午十時恢復公佈平衡稅率及法定外匯、一秉旣定政策辦理、而英商匯豐銀行之黑市外匯掛牌、依然穩定、於是黑市外匯不維持之謠、已不攻自破、關於中國外匯平準基金、自中美中英貸款訂約後平準基金增加一萬一千萬元之鉅、所以法定外滙決能持久維持而不墜、至於上海黑市外匯、爲顧全當商人之營業、決予繼續維持、歸平準委會辦理之、</p>

<h3>四行復業限價取消　米價昨又暴漲　投機者既不顧一切濫肆扳抬　當局斷然行動之時機已成熟</h3>
<p>米市塲管理委員會昨奉工部局何德奎副　辦論令、乃即繕發第一九三號通吿該市塲云、茲奉工部局論、中中交農四行已經復業、金融安定、本月十七日之緊急限價、准即取銷、自本日（昨日）起、准商民依照供求之經濟原理、妥定合理之市價、等語、用特公吿週知、</p>
<p>一日間抬價四五元</p>
<p>昨日米市塲開做後、投機行爲依然在熱、米號已入塲、掮客未上市、各檔米價每石又被抬高四五元之鉅、最高國米每石售價已達一百四十元、西貢一號亦上漲全一百卅八元、一週來本市米價每石竟上漲十五六元、如再無澈底解決辦法、則民食問題之嚴重、實不堪設想、故市民盼當局不顧一切、照棧米來本、嚴定限價、</p>
<p>每石可獲利四十元</p>
<p>查近日米價上漲之主因、全係大囤戶居奇扳抬、米號家爭購現貨、及一般盲從之徒羣起效尤、使投機份子在市塲所散播之無稽謠言、起甚大之作用、致助長泛濫之漲風、而來源方面、昨日又運到三萬餘包、國米運抵本埠者、亦達三百餘包、本市米糧存底、實有增無减、查目前堆棧所囤積者、及逐日所運抵者、每石成本、最多不過九十餘元、惟目下售價已被抬高至一百三十餘元、一轉瞬間、每石獲利已達四十餘兀、一般囤戶、尙不肯儘量脫售、居心之叵測、不言可喻矣、</p>
<p>廉價港米應速運滬</p>
<p>公共租界當局、前曾與香港當局來滬代表商定、每月由港供給本市洋米二十五萬包、而其每石價格、則低於本市現售米價達二十餘兀、因未爲雜糧豆米業所贊同、故當局擬將此種廉價之米、直接售與米號、俾减輕市民負担、昨據記者探悉、該廉價米糧、尙未運抵本市、故米號業方面、仍無法購得、祇得在米市塲不法份子操縱下購買、故各界深盼當局，立即設法將該項米糧、從速運滬、使米價得稍稍抑平、以蘇一般平民之艱苦生活、</p>

<h3>從施粥廠歸來（一）</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>米價貴，燃料亦貴，一切生活用品俱貴，貴到如此地步，拍手稱慶的有人，垂頭喪氣的更不知有多少萬數人。</p>
<p>非至飢餓時，不知米糧之可貴；故與有飯吃的人談米糧貴，大可「免開尊口」。蓋為米糧雖貴，然較之十餘兀一磅糖菓，一元法幣一只花旗蜜橘，還是便宜得多。若有一萬或八千包的米，揑在手裹的還在伸長脖子望米價漲哩！</p>
<p>只有看見飢餓錢上掙扎的人們，方覺得米糧眞是續命湯，「得之則生，不得則死」，絲毫不可勉强的。故在平時看待很平常的米飯，有了飯吃，還要餚饌；有了餚饌還嫌無味。設使他的生活直綫下降到與一般生活相水平的時候，他如果有悔禍的中心，亦將深悔以前的奢侈浪費，感覺到當初蹧蹋米糧的不當，纔知道米糧的功用，速比一切奇珍異饈爲偉大，爲珍貴。明朝某相，窮奢極慾，雪白肥厚的飯滓，天天從陰溝中流人宅旁的寺院內，寺僧見而惜之，從汚水中拾起，漂淨，曬乾，貯藏，以供食用。及某相以事敗，房產遭封，僦居宅旁寺院中，僧以白飯享之，食之甘甚言於僧，僧曰，此即相公家中物也，並道其故，某慚悔欲絕。看到這種情形願爲今日一般有飯吃不顧無飯吃的人，請他多多惜福，從速造福，切莫專顧目前的口福，不顧後來的禍福，方是十全的大福！</p>
<p>我亦是同樣在目前艱苦生活中掙扎的一人；可是我常自慰，我雖比上不足，比下有餘，但物價如此高漲下去，我們的生活，亦必有從平時最刻苦的水準，降到以下或最下的一日。可是進了施粥廠一參觀。見了吃粥的人，不禁發生無限的感觸，而於我私人生活，不覺得着無限的安慰。</p>
<p>我嘗覺辦振，不但任勞而且仟怨，亦須要一分精神，方有一分成效。我平時對於舊時慈善團體，深佩服他們存心好，用意善，但於辦事組織各方面，不無爲種種關係，因陋就簡遠不逮公教基督敎所辦的事業能精神貫澈。我最喜歡參觀各種救濟事業，作爲硏究資料，蓋我以爲欲治療社會病態，必先明白種病的原因及歷來治療的方法。但是我從不喜歡曲譽人，亦不喜苛求人。我深知「辦振是難事」，「批評容易辦事難」，可是我昨從施粥廠歸來，不覺對於今之慈善團體辦事，於各方面都有進步，確乎便當刮目相看了。</p>

<h3>光</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>最近德軍當局，爲調查燈火管制對各種火光的光度及照射的遠近起見，特由科學家准行各種試騐，結果發覺火柴燃點時可於半哩外望見，路燈可以在一哩又四分之一以外望見，由窗戶透出之屋內燈光，可於十二哩半以外望見之。因此在提防空襲的燈火管制之夜，就是星星之火也是關係重大的。</p>
<p>區區一根火柴，看看抽烟的人一燃幾秒鐘了事，恐怕誰也沒料到在黑暗中可以照耀到半哩外的吧。</p>
<p>所以星星之火，假使運用不　其當，是可以闖出滔天的大禍來的。</p>
<p>在相反的一面，星星之火也可以成爲暗夜旅人的引路明燈。這立刻使我聯想到在今日的社會上過着最淸苦的生活的中小學敎師了。他們正在黑暗中發射着點點的光明。在深沉的夜裏，這完全不是徒然的。</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>自然界的戰術</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>「爲生活而鬭爭」旣然是天演論的最大論據，也就是自然界的普遍現象：因此，每種生物有每種生物自己的特種戰術。現在不談那平淡無奇的蟻類的「陣地戰」，黃鼠狼捉雞的「襲擊戰」，……更不把『鷹鸇之遂鳥雀也」喻作「空戰」，且揀幾個平常人不注意的東西來談談。</p>
<p>神經戰</p>
<p>根據大科學家湯姆生的言論：弱小的生物利用擬態或保護色，以免惹敵人的注意；而强大或有劇毒的東西呢，却反而誇大炫耀自己的體格彩紋等，以表示自己的有恃無恐，好叫敵人驚惶戰慄，達到自己不戰而勝的目的。譬如那錦鱗燦爛，五色俱備的毒蛇怪蟒等，便是絕好的例子。這種陳兵耀武，虛聲恫嚇的手段，可以稱之爲神經戰。</p>
<p>躱空襲</p>
<p>落花生開花在地上，受精在地上，可是爲撫餐保護它那寶貴的種子，却要叫它們深深地　到地下層中：要是拿生物學上最大的公律「目的論」來解釋，這不是很明顯地要躱避那些饞嘴的鳥雀的空襲嗎？至於其他一切的塊莖或塊根植物，是不是也可以拿這種眼光去衡量呢？</p>
<p>布陷阱</p>
<p>以植物而想吃動物，以不能行動的而想吃會飛躍的！那麼，除了用甘餌引誘敵人墮入到自己的陷穿中，又有旁的什麽好法子呢？捕蠅草張蒲那邊緣上滿生剛刺的葉子，但等那倒霉的蟲豸陷入重地，便馬上犬牙相錯地合攏起來，叫牠們眞的挿翅難飛！豬籠草開蒲它那帶蓋的而半含淸水的「罐子」，瓶子草張着它那裏面倒毛叢生而滿含黏液的「瓶子」：只要貪嘴不顧命的東西取來光顧它們的蜜汁，好，一失足滑到裹頭，馬上就有蓋的蓋，有毛的杜，這叫做能進而不能出！</p>
<p>放步哨</p>
<p>鹿，我們知這，是喜歡羣居而過團體生活的動物，牠們白盡在一塊兒奔馳遨遊，黑夜也在一塊兒休息睡覺，可是在睡覺的時候，一定有一兩個値夜的，在大家附近巡邏瞭望，好防備敵人的偷營刦寨。假設有一點風吹草動情形可疑的話，牠們便嘶叫呼喚，警醒全體的同伴。這不是儼然我們人行軍時所置的放步哨嗎？</p>
<p>總司令</p>
<p>非洲熱帶的象羣，又給我們一種很淸楚的戰陣的印像。當牠們成羣結隊的覔食或奔赴水泉時，總是由一個最老的，最有經騐的前行開路，其餘的在後　排着一字縱隊緊緊相隨。領路的象，常是把鼻子高舉半空：其餘的或左或右惟牠的「象鼻是瞻」！就是遇着敵人的時候，或者衝鋒陷陣，或者退避三舍，也全由那高舉着的鼻子指揮：這不是一位總司令又是什麽？</p>

<h3>雄鷄生蛋不希奇</h3>
<p>— 宋誠</p>
<p>最近吳淞鎭某戶飼養雄雞一頭，忽然生蛋，這新聞傳爲奇談。其實，依照生物學上講，是一點也不希奇的。</p>
<p>爲什麽有雌有雄的區分呢？關於這個問題，已經有很多生物學家，用許多種方法，作過多年的硏究。有一類研究，是用顯微鏡方法做的。這類硏究的結果，査出是細胞裹有一種特別染色體——性染色體（Sex　Chromosome）的關係。但是有的時候，生出一種半雌半雄的反常狀態，叫做中間性（Lntersex）中間性生物的生殖器官和第二性徵，都有幾分像雌的，父有幾分像雄的。何以生物有這種中間性呢？舉生物學裏的解釋：每個生物身體」裏都有二種趨勢，一種是向着雌性演發的，一種是向着雄性演發的。倘雄性强些，就成雄性。雌性强些，就成雌性。如若雌性與雄性演發的勢力相等，這個生物就現出中間性。</p>
<p>如若身體裏雌雄性勢力的强弱發生變化，原來比較强的勢力，變成比較弱的，這個生物的雌雄性，似乎可以反轉過來。近來已經有人發現許多種動物果眞可以由雌性變成雄性的，或者由雄性變成雌性的。這類現象叫做性反轉（Sex-reversal）。有人試騐：把雄雞的精巢割去之後，雄性式樣的雞冠，肉垂和羽毛就不能充分發達出來：把雌雞的卵巢割去之後，反能現　雄雞的性質。雌雞　晨，是一件反常的事，又是　容易見到的事。有人細心考察這種現象，查出一個雌雞在已經生蛋和孵蛋成小雞之後，牠的卵巢，因爲瘤病消滅了，後來漸漸生出精巢，發　雄雞式的啼聲，現出雄雞式的雞冠與肉垂，換成雄雞式的羽毛，最表，能與雌雞交配。這是明事貫。</p>
<p>現在，有雄雞生蛋的新聞，便是與上述的例相反，而這雄雞趨雄性。那隻雄雞，精巢大概業已消滅，而生起卵巢，竟生蛋了。這是性反　的現象無疑，決不是甚麼不祥之兆。</p>
<p>人情</p>
<h3>人吃人</h3>
<p>— 左右</p>
<p>原始的民族，時常因爲食糧缺乏，將部落中間老弱的人民殺死了煮食充飢。可是人類除了爲飢餓所迫而自相殘食以外，尙有若干野蠻的民族，爲了各種不同的理由，而幹着人吃人的殘酷的把戲。</p>
<p>在菲洲蠻荒之處，以及南洋羣島與太平洋羣島諸地，有許多殺人不眨眼的土人，非常愛食人肉。據說這些土人，覺得仟何獸肉，都不及人肉可口，所以他們每逢捉獲一個敵人或旅客之時，便饞液欲滴，總要把他殺死吞食，才肯罷休。美洲墨西哥地方，也有一種土人，竟把捉到的俘虜，當做家畜看待。他們每次戰爭回來，便將所擒的敵人，仔細剔擇，把肥胖的俘虜，先行殺死烹煮，權充他們慶功筵席上的盛饌，至於剩下來的贏瘦的俘虜，便被餵養着，待身軀肥胖以後，再被殺死。</p>
<p>蘇　答臘有一種半開化的土人，以爲人死之後，便將跑到一座非常幸福的樂園中去；可是，在到達樂園之前，必須先經過　頂險狹非常的獨木橋，獨木橋下面，橫着萬丈深淵，年老力衰的人在橋上行走，一不小心，便要失足傾跌下去，永遠不能走進那座樂園了。因此，該土人中間的孝順兒孫們，爲使他們父母死後，能够順利地通過那頂獨木橋起見，便不待其父母變成過份衰老，就要將他們殺死煮食了。這些孝順的子孫們，在吞食目己老人的時候，還要舉行隆重的儀式，他們先把一切親戚朋友們邀來觀禮，然後將年老的父母送上一棵樹上，接着大家聚集在樹下跳舞唱歌，唱了一會，便有幾個人把樹身竭力搖撼，爬在樹上的老人，支持不住，便從上面掉下來，於是衆人一哄而上，把那跌得半死的老人，用刀分割成爲兩段，一段煮熟了分饗嘉賓，一段則丟在曠野之之處，聽任鳥獸啄食。</p>
<p>美洲北部餓一種好鬬的紅人，喜歡煮食人心。他們以爲吃了人心之後，就會增加戰鬭的勇氣，所以他們每次殺了一個人以後，一定要把這人的心肝挖出來，用火烤熟，切成薄片，分給各位戰士們享用。</p>
<p>此外，菲洲內部也有一種黑人民族，常把犯罪的人殺死，然後把死人的肉，分給大家烹食，可是他們平日是不吃人肉的。</p>
<p>以前吾國邊境的未開化民族，也有吃人肉的行爲。金沙江上流，蘊藏着許多銀鑛，該地的猓猓人，便以採冶銀鑛爲生；可是他們採冶的技術，頗爲幼稚，因此，往往所得銀子極少，猓猓人便以爲這是因爲當地的漢人，觸怒了鑛神的緣故，所以他們一見漢人，便設法把他擒住，殺了去祭祀鑛神，然後分嚐那死者的皮肉。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鶴</p>
<p>（七）　臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>袁鎭守使叔姪倆都不見，院子裏有個小厮正在澆花一見秋海棠進來，便丟下水壺，急不及待的奔進哀面去。</p>
<p>秋海棠解下了長衣，很無聊地在一張紅木旋椅上坐着，心裏還不停的在怗記他那病了的女兒。</p>
<p>這間屋子距離哀寶藩的上房已經很近，秋海棠雖沒有　去過，但依着情形推測起來，至多冉隔一排屋子，必然就是湘綺的寢室了。</p>
<p>他坐定了不到一分鐘，彷彿就聽得裹面有許多人的聲音，亂七八糟的在吵鬧着；好像有人在高聲叱駡，父有人在哭泣。　板頓得震天價的響，並且還夾着一個小孩子受了極大的驚嚇的哭喊聲，似乎最後一進屋子的樓上，正在排演一齣全武行的好戲。</p>
<p>秋海棠的心開始有些跳動了，但即使他站到了窗前去，也聽不見裏面有湘綺的聲音。</p>
<p>突然，方才奔進去的那個小厮又退出來了，可是他並不再澆花，却一言不發的在階石上坐定了，每隔一會兒，便旋過頭來向秋海棠看看，透着極度可疑的神氣。</p>
<p>「裏頭有什麽事鬧得天翻地覆的？」秋海棠倒忍不住先向他詢問起來。</p>
<p>「沒有什麽。」那小厮堆着滿臉很尷尬的神氣說：「請你坐一會，大帥馬上就耍出來了。」</p>
<p>秋海棠正想竭力把心神安定下去，突然聽得裏面一聲惨叫，接着又是撲通一響，人聲使更雜亂起來了；而那　聲慘叫叫得又是那麽尖，那麼高，聽在耳朶裏，便立刻知道是打女人的喉管裏發出來的。他雖沒有聽湘綺這樣叫過，一時不敢決定是她，但裏面除了她以外，誰還敢這樣叫喊呢？（九三）</p>

<p>— 沈浮</p>
<p>提起却利，麥卡賽，影迷們口角旁必定會浮起一個自然而然的微笑。那個怪模怪樣的木孩子，說起話來老氣橫秋俏裏俏皮的，一舉一動都叫人發笑。</p>
<p>關於好萊塢許多明星的動態，儘有許多不厭求詳的報道，散見報章雜誌。這裹，筆者來介紹一點關於却利的一鱗半爪，想爲讀者所歡迎吧。</p>
<p>身體面貌——却利速他的能立能行的身體，共長三十八吋，重四十磅，却利除原來的頭之外，有幾個作替身的頭，和五六個身體。原來的頭是支加哥一個酒排間管事名叫麥克的所雕，以美金三十五元售給愛加，勃根——却利的主人，却利的靈魂，那個頭髮梳得光光的，和却利寸步不離的傢伙，今年三十七歲，支加哥人，却利有桃紅的靨和雜亂粗紅的頭髮。他的面貌有一種奇異的特質，以至不能複製。來往電台播音時，都有賽珞芬（透明紙）罩着以免他的膚色被風吹壞。勃根擬照原樣另雕幾個，試了多次，均吿失敗。所以祇得爲却利保險美金五千元。却利旅行時，必須購全票一張，因爲保險公司一定要他佔有一間車廂，如此才能將他鎖在裏面。幾年前在紐約，他的一個替身，被人綁去，鬧得幾乎全國騷然；可是勃根自己知道，眞的却利還安然藏在好萊塢某銀行的保管庫里呢。</p>
<p>聲譽一斑——却利最近到紐約去播音，有六萬人索取播音室參觀券。當他在中央火車站下車時，許多攝影記者將攝影機高舉過頂，從人叢中擠進去，大聲呼喊，「叫那傢伙讓開些。」「那像伙」便是勃根。在舊金山和紐的世界博覽會裏，都有一天麥卡賽日。電影藝術學院曾頒給却利一枚木雕的奧斯卡獎章。</p>
<p>收入概况——却利的收入，的有羅斯福總統的五倍。單是鬧鐘，襯衫，玩偶和許多小玩藝用他做招牌，每年要付給他十萬美元呢。</p>
<h3>劉天紅雅興不淺</h3>
<p>— 梅荘</p>
<p>劉叔詒君，藝名天紅，爲湘省世家子，（劉坤一總督即君之族叔祖）以嗜曲乃習爲伶工。君天資求絕，逾於常兒，五六齡即能登臺彩爨，八歲已以頭牌姿態出演於共舞臺，「哭祖廟」一劇，爲顧曲者所劇賞，至今猶稱道弗衰。民十六春，君離滬北上，習藝於余氏叔岩之門，力學三載，藝已進於大成，偶在故都出演，（與荀慧生合作甚久）口碑甚佳，報章亦一致推重，謂君之藝，以淸雅澹遠勝人，戰太平珠簾寨問樵鬧府諸劇，深得余氏眞傳，觀此數語，君之造詣，可以概見。後以敗嗓，遂憤而改業，然公餘之暇，仍不忘情於聲音之道，引吭高歌，依然當年餘韻，名票如鄂呂弓在嘯水孫養儂諸君，皆同聲贊許，謂唱戲懂得「韻」字訣者，叔岩而外，惟君一人而已。最近黃金當局請君客串，呂弓尤力爲慫恿，君拍案而起曰：間居無俚，正感落寞，一試歌喉，亦大快事，故未加考慮，即毅然應允，陽春白雪，古調獨彈，我知慕君盛名而未聆其歌者，聞此消息，定將奮然興起，一聽其雅奏以爲快也。</p>
<h3>閒話「捉放曹」</h3>
<p>— 若水</p>
<p>近來，無論是南方，或是北方的「譚派老生」，幾乎沒有一個不常貼演「捉放曹」一劇的，「捉放曹」全劇計分四折爲：公堂，行路，殺呂，宿店，現在一般演此劇的，大都祇演行路，殺呂，宿店三折，甚至有祇演行路，殺呂，而减去頭尾公堂，宿店者，旣未「捉」亦未「放」與劇名情節，大相違悖，偷懶之罪，在戲律上實難姑息也。</p>
<p>今之演「捉放曹」者，如言菊朋，譚富英，楊資森，奚嘯伯，周嘯天諸子，成績胥不弱，其中以譚富英，楊寶森演得較好，言菊朋晚年嗓狹腔怪，故不取。</p>
<p>「捉放」之難，不在唱工之繁重，而在先西皮後二簧，蓋二簧沉着味厚，聲調蒼老，非嗓佳者不可，因其多走低腔，不若西皮之流利高峭，可藉助於假嗓，並可利用長過門以事休息，因爲西皮之過門，長於二簧，所以先二簧後西皮，常人所能，若使先西皮後二簧，則鮮有不聲嘶力竭者。而且三段一簧，接續而米，一段緊湊一段，無休息之餘地，是以嗓不結實，氣不充沛之徒，不敢輕易歌「捉放」也，然則今之演「捉放」者，僅演行路，殺呂，畏難偷懶，咎不可辭也。</p>
<p>曩時，在桂芬，譚鑫培，二氏皆以此劇名於時，可謂絕唱，此外奎派老生雙闊亭亦擅之，黃鐘人呂，風格別具，在譚物化後，宗桂芬者殊少，個中自以王鳳卿爲近似，悲憤激越之氣猶彷彿如汪，譚派中演此劇者甚夥，然皆不若羅小寶爲文靜有味，今羅已逝去，叔岩嗓音單薄不勝，餘子如譚富英，楊寶森雖尙可觀，然較諸前輩諸伶，已相距不可以道里計矣。</p>

<p>這時候的李信，環境已　，心理亦因此而改易，一方面欣賞着紅娘子的冶媚，一方面感激着紅娘子的救護，走上前向紅娘于深深一揖道：「以前種種都是我的不是，千乞原諒。昨蒙銳身相救深情大德，令我終身不忘，銘感肺腑。」紅娘子回轉頭來一笑道：「你今日方知我的情床意　嗎？你這人好沒良心！我把一片眞心對待你，溫柔纏綿，博你的喜悅。誰知你竟會背我而逃，掉首　顧，豈不是心腸太硬了嗎？自從你下山以後，我十分不放心，立刻打發探子到杞縣去探聽消息。等到探子回報，始知你被杞縣令陷害在獄。這是你自投羅網。我本待　來救你這個薄情負心的人，但一念你雖然對我淡漠無情，而尙沒有惡意，否則你也好棄機把我殺了，回去報功。却不忍害我，尙非不仁不義之徒。而且你被繫下獄，仍是為了我的關係。我若不來救你，還有誰來搭救呢？因此我和哥哥商議之後，決定下山援救。我和兒郎二十餘人，喬裝先行，混入城中前來刦獄。我哥哥率大隊人馬隨後攻城，分兩批行事。現在且喜已把你救了出來，你的仇恨也已報了，重又來至靑石山上。從今以後，你這顆心可再要活動而改變嗎？你還嫌我是個女盜而不願意和我結合嗎？」紅娘子說到這裏，李信早握着伊的柔荑說道：「不敢不敢，我如今認識你是個女中丈夫，俠義之單，怎敢再把你和盜匪一般看待？你的愛心我完全接受了。况我已是無家可歸，你放心吧。我決不再有貳心，眞心誠意的願和你結爲夫婦，白頭到老。天日在上，我李信　爲不叛之臣。你放心吧。」（五〇）</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Aid to China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>American public opinion is the source of politics and the embodiment of the highest power in the nation beyond constitutional provisions. The maturation of public opinion comes from the fierce rise and fall of opposing views, eventually leading to harmony and unity, and from the product of space and time. Roosevelt has been in office as President for nine years, and "the people are still the same, the country is still the same." However, the current method of providing maximum aid to Britain in the war was unimaginable last year. This is not because there is any difference in policies or personnel this year compared to last year; rather, it is because last year, public opinion was still in the midst of fierce rise and fall, not yet harmonized or unified, whereas this year, it has matured. Regarding aid to China, there has never been strong opposition. The main issues are the warmth of attitude, the weight of quality, and the urgency of timing. The trend shows a gradual shift from cold to hot, from light to heavy, and from slow to urgent. The space for the aid-to-China movement is expanding, and time is moving forward. In the near future, we will see the maturation of public opinion that treats aid to China and aid to Britain equally. The aid-to-China movement, aiming for equal treatment with Britain, has been rising at a rapid rate in the past three to four months. The other night, former US Ambassador to France Mr. Bullitt gave a speech to many prominent figures, urging equal support for China and Britain. His speech was based on eloquent facts and filled with passion, which will surely accelerate the maturation of this movement into public opinion. What is particularly gratifying is that the agreement for the US $50 million China Stabilization Fund and the British £5 million China Stabilization Fund, totaling 1.9 billion 法幣 (Chinese legal tender) at the Shanghai exchange rate, has just been signed and established. While some may be shocked by this huge sum, and others may be satisfied with this generous aid, Mr. Bullitt's speech came after the signing of the loan agreement. This best illustrates that those who understand the severity of the Far East issue, the value of China's war effort, and the direct connection between China's war and American well-being do not see this generous aid as the end, nor are they satisfied with this huge sum. Such a view should be gratifying not only to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Mr. Bullitt's speech contained many cautionary words, such as "The only reason we (the United States) have not been attacked by Germany, Italy, and Japan is that they have no spare strength to reach us; Britain prevents Germany and Italy from disengaging in Europe, and Japan is similarly trapped by China; China is exhausting Japan, and its assistance to Britain and the United States is greater than what we have already assisted China; China is fighting for our safety, no less than Britain." These explanations are all accurate and incisive. From this, by discussing cause and effect, the fairness of rights and obligations, the pain and difficulty suffered by China and Britain, and the close relationship between the United States and China and Britain, one can inevitably reach the conclusion and assert that the United States must, and indeed urgently, aid China in the same form as aid to Britain, and provide China with the assistance it needs. Mr. Bullitt's speech also focused heavily on the Soviet Union. He believed that the recent neutrality pact signed by the Soviet Union and Japan was akin to the two countries becoming bandit brothers to divide China. He also believed that one of China's hopes was that the Soviet Union would eventually provide China with effective military assistance to defend against Japan, but the Chinese now know that this hope has been shattered. They also fear that the Soviet Union's current limited assistance to China may be cut off at the orders of Hitler. This view stems from his belief that "Communist countries are the enemies of all who live in freedom," revealing his prejudices and their origins. We need not dwell on the origins of his prejudices; however, we can take this opportunity to state our different observations: The result of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact certainly partially explains why the Soviet Union will not provide China with effective military assistance to defend against Japan; however, our observation is that China never hoped from the beginning that the Soviet Union would engage in military conflict with Japan for the sake of China, so it cannot now be regarded as the disillusionment of this hope. Secondly, the existence of contradictions between the Soviet Union and Japan will not be eliminated by the neutrality pact. The question is whether the Soviet Union will have such a day, engaging in military conflict with Japan for its own sake. As for whether the Soviet Union's aid to China will continue, it does not depend on Japan's desires but on the threat that the Soviet Union feels from Germany or Japan, whether it can overcome them, and what it cannot withstand. Its quantity does not depend on China's needs but on the strength that the Soviet Union has to spare. Whether it will revert to its old ways and divide China does not depend on the plans of the Soviet Union and Japan but on the success or failure of China's survival and self-reliance; it does not depend on the current desires and impulses of the Soviet Union and Japan but on the long-term interests of the Soviet Union. Regarding the Soviet Union, there have always been many in Britain and the United States who harbor deep-rooted suspicions, and Mr. Bullitt is likely one of them, which we do not wish to agree with. However, we sincerely wish to say one more word to Mr. Bullitt and some British and American people who share his views. We will not lightly discuss how the Soviet Union advances or retreats in Europe or how it makes friends or enemies. In the Far East, the situation seems chaotic but is actually simple, seems disorderly but is actually consistent. The future of the Far East is determined solely by the rise and fall of China. Without the China issue, there is almost no so-called Far East issue. The strength of the future voice of countries other than China in the Far East depends on the amount of support each country currently provides to China. No matter how it evolves, this is an inevitable and subtle formula!</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Broadcasts to England, Saying that Britain is Fighting for Democracy and that Although There are Temporary Setbacks, Ultimate Victory is Inevitable</h3>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) rebroadcasted Madame Chiang's speech last night, expressing the Chinese people's sympathy and admiration for the British people. It stated that the British, like the Chinese people, are fighting for democracy. Any army cannot win every battle or gain advantages everywhere. As long as Britain's morale remains undiminished and its people remain strong, possessing the necessary conditions to continue fighting for freedom, it will inevitably achieve ultimate victory. Madame Chiang also appealed to Britain to donate to the China Relief Fund run by foreigners, saying that the Chinese people will never forget the aid given by Britain. China has been fighting for four years, and there are 50 to 60 million refugees. (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The BBC specially invited Madame Chiang Kai-shek to deliver a speech in English to Britain at 2:40 AM on the 28th. The BBC used a medium-wave and long-wave radio station to broadcast it nationwide on the 20th and used shortwave to report to the world at 3:45 AM. This is the first time that the BBC has invited an important figure from our country to speak. In order to ensure clear reception, the BBC specially asked Madame Chiang to broadcast in advance at 2 AM on the morning of April 20. The BBC recorded the sound in London, fearing that the reception would not be clear at the time, so that there would be time to re-broadcast and correct it. This shows its seriousness about this event. After Madame Chiang broadcasted at the Chongqing International Broadcasting Station on the 20th, a telegram was received from London stating that the reception was very satisfactory. The translated record of Madame Chiang's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Friends in England, during our war against Japan, you have given China sympathy and assistance. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to you today and to briefly express the gratitude of my compatriots. The British donations to relieve China's disasters, formerly known as the "Sir Meyrick Relief Fund," have always encouraged our fight for freedom. We know that Britain is also engaged in a difficult life-and-death struggle, but British people are still doing their best to continue to support us. We Chinese have always been a nation that does not forget favors, and we will naturally never forget this expression of friendship from Britain. Today, my broadcast topic is about my</p>
<p>Relief Efforts. Four years of war have turned 50 to 60 million Chinese compatriots into refugees. Some have been temporarily settled, while others are still displaced and will not have a stable life until the end of the war. But they would rather endure this current hardship and difficulty than be ruled by the Japanese. Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed our undefended cities and villages in the rear. Taking Chongqing in June last year as an example, two days of continuous air raids left 70,000 residents homeless. Throughout the summer, on clear days and moonlit nights, Japanese planes bombed without fail. By winter, Chongqing was left with only dilapidated ruins and desolation. But today, if you</p>
<p>Come to Chongqing to Take a Look, what kind of impression would you get? Temporary, simple houses are being built as fast as bamboo shoots after rain. How is this possible? Because the Chinese spirit does not know the word failure. Those merchants, in the places where the Japanese dropped bombs and set fires, rebuild their huts and reorganize their old industries before the smoke and ashes cool down. Many organizations, such as the New Life Movement Association, church groups, and various cooperatives, under the leadership of the government, are helping the affected citizens with excellent results. We do not regard the affected compatriots as objects of pity but feel that they are worthy of respect. Patriotic citizens are active members of productive enterprises. The relief committee has been operating 17 handicraft and light industry factories and is actively promoting several</p>
<p>Reclamation Plans. 1.83 million refugees have been arranged to work on land reclamation. In 1938, the Japanese bombed the large bank of the Yellow River, burying more than 200,000 compatriots. Now, many refugees are also engaged in embankment repair work. At the beginning of the war, our country had only 6,000 registered doctors, and the army alone needed at least 50,000 military doctors. The supply of medical supplies was also severely short, so British friends, the doctors and medical equipment provided to us by the International Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross have greatly benefited both our military and civilians. Here, I want to mention the important contribution of our country's women to the war. The General Association of Chinese Women's Comfort Corps has raised no less than</p>
<p>50 Million Yuan in medical supplies and medical relief funds over the past four years. Most of the staff in the front-line and rear hospitals are volunteers. They gladly sacrifice the comfort of their lives to serve the country. We are also providing education and care to the 25,000 refugee children rescued from the war zone, hoping that they will gradually forget the tragic experiences of the past and restore the joy and innocence that they should have in childhood under the care of loving caregivers. If we had sufficient tools and equipment, perhaps we could rescue even more refugee children. I have one last thing to say: there is no army in the world that wins every battle, and there is no army that wins everywhere. As long as a country's morale does not decline and the people's will does not waver, they will surely achieve</p>
<p>Final Victory. You can firmly believe that China will never lay down its weapons until justice is reaffirmed. Only in this way can we comfort the heroic spirits of those comrades who have made noble sacrifices. I hope you can feel that our struggle and Britain's struggle are both spiritually and in fact for the same goal. Because we have personally experienced it for four years, we sympathize with your current suffering more deeply than any other nation. To the British friends who are fighting bravely for democracy, we in China express our infinite sympathy and admiration. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>American Celebrities Call for Aid to Britain: Provide Military Aircraft to Enable Britain to Achieve Victory and Deliver Them by Warships to Their Destination</h3>
<p>New York: Rockefeller, the son of the American oil magnate, sent a letter to the publisher of the New York Times, which stated that he firmly believed that the American people and the people of South American countries could actively assist the British Empire at any cost. Everyone, in particular, should work together to enable President Roosevelt to deliver a large amount of armaments to Britain, enough to enable Britain to achieve victory. The United States can only manufacture armaments, and if it cannot transport them to their destination, it will still be of no avail. The key is how to accomplish this task. This is the responsibility of President Roosevelt and his military advisors. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>New York: Mr. Douglas, chairman of the "Committee to Aid Britain in Defending America," recently issued a speech stating that the United States should dispatch warships to escort armaments to Britain. Although this policy is extremely dangerous, the loss of British merchant ships is "quite alarming." He said that if we are alone and friendless in the current world, it is also extremely dangerous. We can manufacture armaments and load them on ships, but we must be able to transport them to Britain for their use. (Havas dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<h3>Churchill's Broadcast Address Reaffirms Britain's Resolve to Fight, Dispelling Concerns About the Situation's Development, Meeting Difficulties with a Steady Gaze, New Crisis in the Mediterranean May Extend to Western Turkey and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Churchill (see picture) last night broadcast an address to all parts of Britain, reaffirming the unwavering determination of the British people to either win or die, urging listeners not to be alarmed by the current developments in Europe and Africa, and stating the reasons why Britain had to decide to send troops to aid Greece. In this address, Churchill highly praised the actions of the British people under the fierce German air raids, and also expressed his appreciation for the United States' decision to patrol the waters of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Departing for Inspection as if Ascending to the Bridge</p>
<p>Churchill said in his address that last week someone asked him if the people felt a little uneasy because of the severity of the war situation. In order to personally inspect the extent of the public's anxiety, he went to some of the most heavily bombed cities and ports, and the areas where the poor suffered the most. Now that he has returned, he is not only calm and at ease, but also in exceptionally high spirits. Leaving the Prime Minister's office, which is crowded with official duties and has no time all day, and entering the streets and docks of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, and Swansea, is like leaving a stuffy room and ascending to the bridge of a warship. This is a tonic, and he would advise anyone who is tired and needs a boost to take it. The people's spirit is so high that it elevates humanity above the level of material facts and into a peaceful realm that seems not to exist in the current world. He was delighted to see it. The battlefield experience and emotions maintained by our country's sea and land soldiers for hundreds of years are now shared by all the people, regardless of gender, age, or weakness, all of whom are under enemy fire like soldiers. They are proud to be fighting alongside the soldiers on the front lines to the end. In short, the British people are determined to either win or die, which is truly the most heroic period in our history, with infinite glory. You can imagine how deeply he feels his responsibility. His responsibility to the people is to be in office and to help them safely through the difficult times they are currently facing.</p>
<p>Assisting Greece is to Preserve Honor</p>
<p>Churchill continued to talk about the war, saying that the British army, which had captured most of the Italian army in Libya, was very small in number, which few people in the world know. General Wavell, in his repeated victories, never used more than two divisions or 30,000 men at any one time. After the British army reached Benghazi, they received a call that was difficult to refuse. Last November, the Italian army attacked Greece without warning. The Greeks bravely fought back and defeated the Italian army. Hitler secretly arranged to help the aggressors. The lack of unity among the Balkan countries allowed Hitler to gather troops in the central Balkans. While the Greek army was severely defeating the Italian army, the German army took the opportunity to invade the Greek border. Greece, under this threat, asked for our help. Our strength was already strained, but we had to respond to this call. The Greeks had said that if neighboring countries did not help and Britain did not provide assistance, they would fight on their own, but we British could not ignore it, otherwise it would damage the honor of the British Empire. If we lose this honor, how can we hope for or deserve victory? Victory and defeat are not constant and are subject to change, so military actions or miscalculations can be remedied, but shameful and disgraceful behavior will cause us to lose the respect we currently enjoy in the world and will destroy the elements of our strength.</p>
<p>German Propaganda Strives to Drive a Wedge Between Britain and Australia</p>
<p>In the past year, we have, through our actions, gained the unprecedented goodwill of the American people. He dares to say that the actions of the United States are not based on calculations of gain or loss, but on the noble moral emotions that arise from the foundation of human life. We must do our limited best to respond to Greece's call. We consulted with Australia and New Zealand, and both governments declared their agreement without hesitation. Thus, an important mobile land army from part of the Nile River was sent to Greece to fulfill our promise. At that time, the most suitable troops to be mobilized for this campaign were those from Australia and New Zealand, and only half of those who participated in this campaign came from Britain. Now, German propaganda is trying to drive a wedge between Britain and Australia, pointing out that we are unwilling to use British troops for this campaign and are making Australian troops do it instead. He will let Australia deal with this kind of nonsense on its own. We certainly know that the military force that we can send to Greece is not enough to contain the tide of German aggression, but we did hope at the time that Greece's neighbors could take a stand of cooperation with Greece in time because of our participation in the war. As for how this hope was not realized, we will know in the future.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister's Boasting is Laughable and Shameful</p>
<p>Churchill also spoke of Yugoslavia, saying that "the loyal people of that country rose up against a government that sought to submit to Nazi rule and live in humiliation, in order to save their country's soul and future, but it was too late to protect its territory. The army had not yet been mobilized, the soldiers had not yet set out, and the enemy's mechanized units had already crossed the border. At the same time, the Greek army, with its vastly outnumbered forces, could not resist, and the victorious army in Albania was forced to disarm. Since this major change has occurred in the Balkans, the Australian army and others have had to fight on one side and retreat to the sea on the other. Newspapers now carry articles by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini congratulating his army on its victory in Greece. This is truly a laughable and shameful new record in the world. While this tragic event was taking place in the Balkans, our army in Libya was also suffering a worrying setback. The German army's advance was so rapid and its numbers so large that it was beyond the expectations of our generals. The British armored unit, which had previously defeated the Italian army, had to be reorganized, and a British armored brigade, which was originally expected to be able to hold the border until mid-May, had to retreat. Most of its vehicles were destroyed by the superior German armored forces, but our army still firmly defended the Tobruk fortress on the German side, where it repeatedly defeated the enemy and captured many prisoners. This is the recent situation of the war on the Libyan and Egyptian borders.</p>
<p>African War Will Become More Intense</p>
<p>We must now expect that the battles in the Mediterranean, the desert, and the sky will become more intense and widespread. However, our army has now cleared the Italian army in Cyrenaica and will now eliminate the German army. This is more difficult and cannot be accomplished in a short time. You all know that I never disguise defeat as victory. I have never underestimated the German army's combat power. A few months ago, I said that the rapid and continuous victories that our army had gained against the Italians might not continue, and we must be prepared for adversity. One thing that can be determined in the war is that the war is full of disappointments and mistakes. Now, Germany's trampling of the Balkan countries and the creation of a bloody and hateful divide between the Germans and the people of Greece and Yugoslavia is a major mistake that we will see in the future. If Germany, with its current army and supplies, makes the common-sense move to invade Egypt, it will be another mistake that we will have to wait to see in the future. He never wants to predict the outcome of any war that has not yet been fought, but he dares to say that if he sees the armies of both sides in the Middle East exchanging their tasks, and the army led by General Wavell replacing the position of the German army, then he will be very unhappy. This is his personal opinion, and he knows that there may be different observations. In addition to the threat to Egypt, there is almost certainly a new crisis in the Mediterranean. The war may spread to Spain and Morocco in the future, and may even extend to Turkey and the United States. Germany may reach out to seize the granary of Ukraine and the oil wells of the Caucasus, and who can say if it will even covet the Caspian Sea? We can only do our best to deal with it. Wherever the enemy goes, we will fight there. But one thing is certain: Hitler, whether in the East, the Middle East, or the Far East, will not escape the condemnation of justice. If Hitler wants to achieve his goal of victory, he must conquer Britain or cut off the communication lines between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Go All Out to Deal with the Atlantic War</p>
<p>At the beginning of February this year, when he gave a broadcast address, many people thought that the Nazi invasion of Britain was imminent and would soon begin, but the invasion of Britain has not yet been implemented, and our navy, army, and air force have been strengthening their numbers, equipment, combat power, and training every month. In the future, we can guarantee our island. When he compares the current domestic situation with last summer, he feels that we can be happy. He believes that if we do not slacken our efforts, we will eventually show very good results. Saying too much is exaggeration, and being a little lacking in self-confidence is also foolish. So what will be the result of our life in the Atlantic Ocean? What will happen if many ships carrying food that people depend on for their livelihoods are sunk? What will happen if the large amount of war materials that the United States is now planning to transport to Britain are blocked on the way? Hitler threatened in February to intensify the submarine and air war, but we have taken all possible plans to deal with this kind of attack. It is still the same now. We are now concentrating on defending against it. This is what is called the Atlantic War. If we want to survive, we must win this victory. When we think of how easy it is to sink ships and how difficult it is to build ships, when we think of the fact that we have no fewer than two thousand ships sailing on the sea, and no fewer than three or four hundred ships sailing in dangerous areas, and when we think of the large army we are maintaining in the Near East and protecting our communications in the world, we should know how much those who bear the responsibility for winning attach importance to the Atlantic War.</p>
<p>Very Pleased with American Aid</p>
<p>He is very pleased to hear about the major plans recently decided by the American president and people, which Britain can express in words. The American fleet and naval aircraft have now been ordered to patrol the vast sea of the Western Hemisphere to protect the ships of all countries. The American government and people recognize that Britain's war is justified and know that if Britain fails, American interests will also be harmed, so they have made a solemn promise to help Britain in the war. The United States is now providing its resources, using its industry, and exporting its weapons to meet Britain's needs. He knows that it certainly does not want to see its noble actions be ineffective halfway and allow the products of its factories to sink to the bottom of the sea. The submarine warfare carried out by Germany is far contrary to the international agreements that Germany recognized a few years ago. This is not an effective blockade, but a massacre. He is sure that although the Atlantic War will be long and difficult, and its outcome has not yet been decided, it has now entered a more difficult but more satisfying stage. The United States is now closely united with us and is giving us spiritual, material, and naval assistance. Looking at the determination announced by the United States, Hitler and Mussolini will undoubtedly fail. The Huns have a population of less than 70 million, most of whom have been used to suppress the Austrian, Czech, and other ethnic groups. The British and American people number 200 million, already have naval power, and are gradually gaining an advantage in the sky. Their resources, skills, and steel are far beyond what Germany can reach. They have decided not to allow freedom to be trampled by dictators, nor to allow the tide of world progress to be reversed because of this. We are inevitably worried about the development of the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia, but there is no reason to panic. We must face the current difficulties with a steady gaze. What is happening in the East now is far less serious than what we encountered last year. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>The German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa Advance Beyond the Egyptian Border; British Naval and Land Forces are Strenuously Containing Them; German Troops Near Benghazi are Bombed</h3>
<p>Khartoum Yesterday, the Axis forces invading Egypt and its borders, consisting of two columns of motorized troops, presumably mostly Italian, are east south of the Solum escarpment. Informed sources believe that the enemy's advance is no more than fifteen to twenty miles from the sea and shows no signs of southward disturbances. Activity along the line is limited to the area from Capuzzo to Solum. The battle situation is similar to that when the Italian army reached Sidi Barrani last September, except that the invading enemy forces are believed to be much smaller than the four or five divisions used by the Italian side to attack Sidi Barrani last year. The enemy's invasion has been plagued by British armored forces, resulting in some loss of materiel. British armored vehicles are constantly in contact with the enemy forces to impede their advance. Informed sources believe that the enemy may attack Sidi Barrani, but even if the enemy reaches there, the situation will be even more unfavorable to the enemy than last year because its forces are not very strong, and the British army is firmly stationed in Tobruk. Apart from Tobruk, there has been little enemy air activity to date. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Cairo Yesterday, British troops and mechanized units fought fiercely with German and Italian forces in North Africa to prevent their advance. These Axis troops have already admitted to having crossed the Egyptian border near Solum and penetrated twenty-five miles east of Sidi Barrani. British headquarters said today that British forces are advancing along the coastal road and that British ground forces are repeatedly attacking the enemy's flanks to impede their advance. There is no sign that German and Italian forces are advancing south from Egypt. (International News Service, 28th)</p>
<p>London Recently, German forces in North Africa have received a large number of reinforcements and have begun a general offensive against Alexandria (the British naval port in Egypt) and the Suez Canal. German troops have penetrated Egyptian territory in several places. According to British official reports, British forces blocking the German advance have been pushed back. German and Italian mechanized troops, after driving east for four hundred miles from Cyrenaica, have been encamped on the Egyptian border for two weeks, constantly accumulating reinforcements and supplies in preparation for a direct assault on Cairo. During this period, the front-line fighting has been quiet, with only minor contact. However, the British army has also been rushing reinforcements from East Africa to meet the enemy. The purpose of the German offensive, which began immediately after the end of the Balkan war, is clearly to resolve the battle before the British troops in Greece can be transferred back to Africa. At the same time, the German side is stepping up pressure on Spain to coordinate with the Egyptian offensive, with the aim of using the German western pincer to close the Strait of Gibraltar. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Cairo According to official announcements, British armored patrols are now in contact with enemy forces that have crossed the Egyptian border. On Sunday, when several Junkers transport planes landed at the Qinnina airfield near Benghazi, they were attacked by British fighter planes.

<p>The Italian Stronghold of Dessie in East Africa Captured by the British</p>
<p>Khartoum The war in Abyssinia is proceeding smoothly and will soon be over, with the complete occupation of Italian East Africa. The British defense forces in Sudan occupied the Motta fortress on Thursday, capturing twelve enemy officers and hundreds of colonial troops, and seizing two cannons, one fighter plane, and a large amount of stored military supplies. According to Italian colonial troops who deserted and surrendered to the British army in the Amba Alagi area, desertions from the Italian colonial army are increasing daily, so many units are now being liberated. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Nairobi According to an official announcement here, Dessie, an important stronghold of the Italian army in Abyssinia, was occupied by British troops last Saturday. The city is one of the last resistance bases in Italian East Africa. The communiqué stated that our army entered Dessie at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. At present, the Italian army has only two options: to retreat eastward towards French Somaliland or to continue fighting along the road north of Dessie. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties around the city, with more than 300 dead, 600 wounded, and 500 captured. At present, the only larger bases of the Italian army in Abyssinia are Gondar and Jimma. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome The High Command stated that the Italian army, unable to withstand the pressure of the British army, withdrew from Dessie, the last fortress in Abyssinia. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa British troops are now advancing on the last strongholds of resistance by the Italian army in Abyssinia, and preparations for King Selassie's return to the capital are also actively underway. Many civilian houses are flying the blue, gold, and red Ethiopian flag. Patriotic Ethiopian troops have now taken over the defense of the artillery at the capital's airport. A certain hospital in the capital has also opened a special ward for the treatment of wounded Ethiopian soldiers, and Ethiopian women are serving as nurses. News from the front states that the war is proceeding smoothly. In the Campo Chevo Pass (controlling the road to Dessie), South African British troops fighting the Italian army have advanced another two miles. At the same time, Nigerian British troops fighting in the Fiche area of the capital destroyed an enemy motor transport convoy and are continuing to pursue enemy troops in the mountains. In addition, a British Air Force communiqué stated that a hangar storing enemy aircraft at the Makalle airfield was bombed by the British Air Force. Enemy forces and fortresses on Lake Tana were also bombed and strafed. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<h3>Bullitt Urges US Aid to China to Be Like US Aid to Britain; Strongly Attacks the Soviet-Japanese Treaty</h3>
<p>Washington Former US Ambassador to France William Bullitt broadcast to the American people last night, saying that the battlefield in China is, from a strategic point of view, "our country's western front." He called on all Americans not only to aid China with all their resources and strength but also to deliver the necessary goods to China in an effective way. Bullitt strongly argued that the United States should take steps to ensure that all arms, ammunition, and aircraft are delivered to China and to keep this lifeline for US aid to China open forever, the same as it treats Britain, knowing that "China's war effort contributes to our country's security no less than Britain's." Bullitt advocated giving China all the aid it needs so that China will no longer have to rely on the Soviet Union. Bullitt also said that even with Japan attacking China, it is morally and materially moving towards unity and strength. One of the biggest reasons for Japan's attack on China in 1937 was to stop China's progress because China's national strength was developing so rapidly. Japan saw that China was superior to Japan in terms of numbers, resilience, and knowledge. Japan felt that the opportunity to enslave China like Korea would soon be lost. Bullitt also recalled his visit to Chiang Kai-shek in 1934, saying that Chiang Kai-shek had predicted to him at that time that Japan would attack China and said that although Chiang Kai-shek believed that Japan might win a temporary victory, he was confident that the final victory would be China's. Bullitt continued that Britain has contained the German and Italian forces across the Atlantic, while China has contained Japan within China, preventing Japan from launching a naval war outside the Chinese war to attack Britain and our country. This China, which contains Japanese power, has already done a very great service to the American people, and the Chinese people have done this service for us far greater than any service we have done for China. China's war effort contributes to America's security no less than Britain's war effort. Bullitt then issued a warning that to maintain China's heroic action, even greater assistance is needed. Bullitt also spoke of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, saying that the Chinese people originally believed that this war against Japan was also attacking Japan on behalf of the Soviet Union, so they all expected the Soviet Union to help to the end. Now the Chinese people have seen Stalin and Matsuoka embracing at the Moscow station. China's only hope at that time was that the Soviet Union could always help China to resist Japan, but today China has seen that this hope, on Hitler's orders, is afraid that not even a drop of aid can be given. Bullitt also declared that communist countries are enemies of all mankind living in freedom. The United States should directly aid China and should do so alone, knowing that helping China is helping the United States. China and Britain are now under severe pressure. For the sake of our own salvation, we must exhaust our country's production of national defense tools. We must not only step up production but also properly send these goods to China and Britain. If we hesitate and covet temporary peace, we will perish. We can no longer leisurely choose between peace and war. The only path we can choose now is to keep our country's lifeline to China and Britain open and to do our best to help these two countries; otherwise, we will be fighting alone in this hemisphere against the combined forces of dictators with resources from Europe, Asia, Africa, and most of South America. We must now choose to back China and Britain regardless of the consequences. Helping China and Britain with all our resources and strength may not avoid war, but whether war can be avoided or not, we must help China and Britain. If the dictators want to fight us, we should let them know that this country (the United States) has never known the word "defeat," and we should let them know that this nation, which opposes the conspiracies and ambitions of these people, values freedom more than life. We should let them know that this trumpet, made by the unconquerable soul of mankind, never blows a retreat. Bullitt severely criticized the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, believing that this agreement has made the Soviet Union and Japan band together as robbers and sacrifice China. Bullitt also said that, however, no one would be so naive as to believe that the Soviet Union and Japan could turn enemies into friends, and said that Stalin was forced to sign this treaty on Hitler's orders. He also said that the Soviet-Japanese Treaty was a gift from Hitler to the Japanese warlords, making Japan feel safe in the north and able to resolutely attack the British and Dutch territories in the east and fight against the British Empire and the United States. Bullitt also said that anyone who believes that America's security can be guaranteed without worry is delusional. "The only reason we have not been attacked by Germany, Italy, and Japan is that they are not yet able to attack us." It is also reported that no fewer than 3,000 people listened to Bullitt, representing the United China Relief Association, deliver a speech in the chamber of the parliament, including government officials, diplomats, and social celebrities. In addition, the new Chinese Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China T.V. Soong were also present to listen to the speech. When Quo Tai-chi arrived, the entire audience greeted him with warm applause. The chairman of the United China Relief Association, Federal Security Administrator McNutt and his wife, presided over the meeting and decided to donate US$5 million to combine with Chinese relief affairs.

<h3>Carol to Fly to Chile</h3>
<p>New York According to news from the Portuguese capital, King Carol of Romania plans to take a Clipper flying boat to Santiago, Chile within days to reside in the capital of that country. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>European War Commentary (48) The Power of the Flying Fortress</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt said, "America is the arsenal of democracy." This is certainly not empty talk, given the scale and speed of production in the US arms manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The democracies need US arms, mainly airplanes, and especially yearn for the assistance of the US "Flying Fortress." The so-called Flying Fortress is a huge bomber, no different from a flying battery. It is equipped with bulletproof defenses and can carry a large number of bombs to bomb thousands of miles away. Its destructive power is far beyond the reach of ordinary bombers.</p>
<p>Douglas and Boeing are famous in the United States for manufacturing Flying Fortresses, which can compete with Germany's most powerful dive bombers and Messerschmitt aircraft. However, the largest factory in the history of aircraft manufacturing is the Douglas plant, which created the Douglas B.19 super bomber, the so-called Flying Fortress. The Douglas plant, which manufactures this type of aircraft, is the largest commercial airport in the United States. It has three manufacturing plants near Los Angeles, California, employing 40,000 workers and manufacturing various types of military aircraft, such as the DB-7 and SBD-1.</p>
<p>The manufacturing project of this type of aircraft is huge. At least 9,000 different drawings were made before the first one, ordered by the US Army Department, was started. Then 500 engineers, technicians, and machinists were mobilized, taking four years and costing $2 million, until it was recently completed, and it is generally recognized as the largest and most powerful bomber in the world. The Douglas B19 Flying Fortress is made of all metal. The fuselage is 132 feet long, the wingspan is 212 feet long, and the height is 42 feet 9 inches. It has a fuel capacity of 11,000 gallons and is equipped with four Cyclone engines, each with a power equivalent to 1,000 horsepower. The landing rubber wheels are 96 inches in diameter and weigh 2,700 pounds each. The maximum speed is 100 miles per hour. It has a crew of ten and can carry 18 tons of bombs, with a range of up to 7,500 miles. In other words, it can fly back and forth between Honolulu and Tokyo, or between New York and Europe, without stopping. Its bombing power can withstand 36 German dive bombers.</p>
<p>The Douglas B19 weighs 80 to 100 tons and is not only suitable for long-range bombing but can also transport soldiers to the battlefield, carrying 125 fully armed soldiers each time.</p>
<p>However, the Douglas B19 takes a long time to manufacture, which is too slow to meet urgent needs. Therefore, the current popular "Flying Fortresses" are all Boeings. The power of this type of aircraft also exceeds that of ordinary bombers by several times.</p>
<p>The Boeing aircraft factory is located in Seattle and uses mass production methods to produce large quantities to meet the urgent needs of the country and foreign countries. The factory is divided into several main parts. (1) The pattern-making department has 500 experts, and each aircraft requires a total of 5,500 drawings from various departments, covering an area of 18,578 square feet. (2) The allocation department. The factory manufactures multiple aircraft at the same time, and each aircraft requires 29,600 parts to be matched. Therefore, each part must be manufactured in order and applied in time. The department has precise statistics on the manufacturing situation. The status of a certain part of a certain aircraft, whether it has not been manufactured, is being manufactured, or has been completed, can be seen at a glance. (3) The manufacturing department, which includes a mold-making workshop, pressing the fuselage and wings; a riveting workshop, drilling holes with electricity and riveting the frame parts; an electric welding workshop, welding all kinds of lead pipes needed for the entire aircraft, 5,400 feet; and a wiring department, installing 1,422 sections of long and short wires needed for the entire aircraft, totaling three and a half miles. In addition, there are raw material department and packaging department, etc.</p>
<p>The Boeing B17 bomber is 68 feet long, the wingspan is over 100 feet long, and the height is 15 and a half feet high. It is equipped with four 1,400 horsepower engines, and there are machine gun emplacements on both sides and at the rear. The range is 3,000 to 4,000 miles, and the maximum speed is 300 miles per hour. The crew consists of seven to nine people. After flying from the United Kingdom to bomb Berlin and returning home, it can continue to fly 2,000 miles, or fly from the United Kingdom to bomb southern Italy or the Skoda armory in Czechoslovakia and return freely overnight.</p>
<p>Boeing's manufacturing rate was about one aircraft every two weeks a year ago, now it is about one aircraft every four days, and it is expected to be one aircraft every two days soon. The US Army Department has ordered 500 aircraft from the factory, and they have been delivered one after another, dozens of which have been transferred to the United Kingdom by the British government for use.</p>

<h3>Grains What is the Reason for Setting a New Price Limit? Or Why Was It Abolished?</h3>
<p>With No Proper Follow-Up Measures, Rice Prices Soared; Speculators Were Unscrupulous and Raised Prices by Over Ten Dollars in a Single Day; Market Prices Were Over Twenty Dollars Higher Than When Prices Were Limited; Over Fifty Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived, and Japonica Rice Also Rose by Five or Six Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bureau of Public Works announced the cancellation of the price limit for foreign rice without proper follow-up measures. As a result, people were agitated and demand increased. Speculators were unscrupulous, and in addition to actual sales to retailers, scattered households, merchants, and rural households, new speculators and outsiders were particularly active. Large households collectively defended and raised prices, while floating households released prices and competed to buy, and the market price soared under the influence of these factors. The price rose sharply and was difficult to contain. No. 1 Western rice was quoted at $136.50, which was still close to the black market price on Saturday. It then rose from $137, $138, $139 to $140, then added one or two dollars, and closed at $145. Informal trading in the afternoon remained active, and the price was raised again by two to three dollars. As a result, it rose by four to five or eight to nine dollars compared to last weekend. The original Ying Wah Sze bag also saw extraordinary activity, with small bags quoted at $162 for spot goods, $153 for futures, and broken rice at $130 for spot goods, $128 to $129.50 for futures, and the market price for rice at $130, with transactions of no less than 2,000 tons and more than 30,000 bags for spot goods. New transactions included 600 tons of Heyi's small bag for the upper period of May, priced at $156.20. In short, the price limit is like the belly of a fat merchant. Each time it is released, it widens once. The bellies of the masses, however, are restricted once and deflate once.</p>
<p>A Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's steamship arrived on Saturday (26th), carrying 10,800 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Beihai steamship arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also carrying 8,337 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jiangsu steamship arrived on the 27th, carrying 10,490 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan steamship also arrived in Shanghai on the 27th, carrying 4,407 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Ganzhou steamship also arrived on the 27th, also carrying 500 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng steamship also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th), carrying 17,112 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. A total of six ships arrived in succession, carrying a total of 56,546 bags of foreign rice. A large quantity of foreign rice arrives continuously, and rice prices rise continuously. This kind of scene loses the common sense of reason. I really don't know how far it will be allowed to go before they are willing to think for the public. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Both Thick and Thin Japonica and other national rice have arrived in scarce quantities, and the market price has been shoulder to shoulder with foreign rice, causing stores to consider it cheaper and demand is quite strong. At the same time, goods see foreign rice repeatedly surging, and the selling mentality is also firm. Under the dual circumstances, the market prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice all rose by a huge five or six dollars. It is estimated that high Kunshan tin Japonica rice is $140, secondary is $138, and the blue corner of the bucket sees thin Japonica rice at $136, and secondary down to $132 or $133. The glutinous rice market is flying high across all goods. Not only are there brisk retail sales to rice porters and cake shops, but also large households are hoarding, so the selling price has also seen an increase. However, it is not as remarkable as the national and foreign rice, with an increase of only three or four dollars. It is estimated that Hong Kong white rice is $124,000 and glutinous tea is $118.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market is Initially Stable, Then Firm; There is Talk of a Supply Suspension for Pingbao Flour</h3>
<p>The flour market is initially stable, then firm. The opening market in the morning was still stable, because the actual sales to merchants were not fierce, and the cargo owners were not eager to sell. Jinlong brand sifted flour traded over a thousand bags, priced at $4.04, and Huawu brand Australian flour traded five hundred bags, priced at $31. However, the Pingmai flour from this factory was sold until yesterday because there was insufficient raw materials. The supply is temporarily suspended, and the quantity and price will be determined again starting next month. In addition, the rice price soared, and people's hearts were suddenly aroused, so the selling price in the later market has been shouted up three or four cents, and all those who held the goods were guarding and hoarding for profit, so the transaction saw rejection.</p>
<p>The wheat trading volume was as light as ever yesterday. Durham wheat has reached the order decline, and domestic arrivals can be said to be extinct. The market supply source has long been interrupted, so buying and selling has stopped invisibly. The factory's retail sales are also without goods to collect.</p>
<h3>Price Limit Lifted, No Drastic Change in Oil Cakes Yet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the concession authorities also abandoned the price limit on the miscellaneous grain and oil cake market, so the transaction situation was still lively. It is estimated that 250 pieces of raw oil, 100 loads of factory oil, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, over two dried bags of various soybeans, over three thousand bags of corn spot goods, three to four hundred tons of futures, and over thirty thousand pieces of spot and futures soybean cakes were traded. However, although the market price was largely outside the price limit under the encouragement of good opportunities for people's hearts, its potential energy was limited due to limited actual sales, and the number of chips on the market was still abundant, inevitably stifling the atmosphere of activity. Therefore, predicting the future, I am afraid it will not be as horizontally leaping as the rice market.</p>
<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange with Large Settlements, Foreign Rice, Kerosene, and Cotton</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's official rate was announced at 9:30 AM, with the US dollar rebounding to 0.0625, calculated at $5.215. Dutch and Swiss rates followed suit, while French and German rates were inactive, and other rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially eased and then rebounded, mainly because the signing of the Sino-British-American Monetary Agreement inevitably triggered selling pressure. Speculators were the first to unload, and foreign banks such as American banks showed interest. The US dollar was strongest, with settlements possible at $5.21875. Around 9:30 AM, it was suddenly reported that import firms dealing in rice, oil, and cotton were aggressively buying, and speculators also shifted to accepting, halting the easing trend. Around noon, it softened to $5.15625, but soon rebounded to the original level. In the afternoon, speculators continued to buy aggressively. Chinese banks such as the East Asia Bank sold US$100,000, and British banks such as the Chartered Bank also sold. The situation remained stable, and the May US dollar only tightened by 0.03125, calculated at $5.15625. Spot and forward British gold, as well as forward US dollars, all closed flat, with brisk trading.</p>
<p>Speculation also driving buying</p>
<p>Since morning, overseas news reported that silver was uniquely strong, while the US and British currencies were flat. The exchange rate between various countries saw the US dollar rise by 0.25 against the British pound, while other rates remained flat. At the opening of the domestic market, the selling prices of banks were: spot British exchange at 3/1875, US dollar at $5.1875, and the Russian ruble immediately strengthened to $5.21875. After speculators sold a small amount to Chinese banks, the Russian ruble saw an American bank sell to Shanghai Continental and Zhejiang Industrial at the same price. Suddenly, it was reported that importers were making large-scale purchases, also at $5.21875 for April and May. Speculators also turned to buying at the same price, and the easing trend stopped, followed by a rebound. HSBC's official British rate was flat, and after the US dollar rose, importers and speculators again rushed to buy the April-May US dollar at $5.1875. Near noon, it was difficult to settle at the above price, but soon rebounded to the original level. At noon, the market price for British gold was 3/1875, and the US dollar was $5.1875.</p>
<p>Closing Market Sees Slight Rebound</p>
<p>In the afternoon, gold prices continued to rise, so speculators bought US$1 million in May US dollars at $5.1875 from the East Asia Bank, but it was difficult to settle. Chartered Bank sold April US dollars to Chinese banks at $5.1875. Spot prices also softened, making settlement at the above prices difficult, but soon rebounded to the original level. At the 4:00 PM closing, spot prices and May futures for British exchange were all at 3/1875. Spot and April US dollars were both at $5.1875, while May futures were at $5.15625. Compared to last Saturday's noon closing, only the May US dollar tightened by 0.03125, while other British exchange rates, both spot and forward, closed flat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Exchange Slightly Tightens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates showed no significant changes. (The spot US dollar closed strong at 24.375 last Saturday noon). The Shanghai tael spot price fell by $2 to $466 (compared to the recovery to $468 last Saturday noon). At 9:20 AM, the spot US dollar tightened by 0.0625 to $24.3125. At 11:30 AM, the Shanghai tael spot price rebounded by $1.50 to $467.50. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Unmoved</p>
<p>Tianjin, 28th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened weaker this morning. Telegraphic transfers to London and New York remained at their original levels, with no changes. The Shanghai tael rose by $0.25 to $98.25. The unofficial price of "Joint Reserve Notes" plummeted by $5 to $54.</p>
<p>Quiet and Weak Foreign Currency Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw volatile spot prices for silver. British and American pounds initially rose but then returned to flat. British gold notes remained stable, with spot prices remaining flat. The US dollar notes showed little fluctuation, ultimately rising by $0.09 compared to last week. Hong Kong notes initially rose but then fell, ultimately decreasing slightly by $0.01. Other notes, such as those from Singapore, Annam, and the Philippines, showed a slight upward trend. Japanese gold notes initially fell but then returned to flat, remaining at the original level of $2.10 in the evening market. Korean notes were in relatively strong supply, and spot prices softened slightly, retreating to $1.83 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Reopen, Gold Market Rises Higher, Influx of Idle Funds Rush to Purchase Cash for Storage</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the silver and unofficial markets initially fell but then suddenly rose. Prices have crossed the $6,700 threshold. Public confidence has greatly stabilized due to the formal reopening of the Four Banks. However, with abundant idle funds, there was a rush to buy foreign exchange and cash. After the agricultural opening, foreign banks closed out their long positions. After seeing a low price of $6,645, news that foreign exchange was tightening due to speculative buying and settlement by foreign firms spurred buying. Gold firms and securities houses rushed to buy, and short positions were quickly covered. The rise accelerated further at noon, exceeding $6,700. In the afternoon, a certain money house aggressively bought, rising to $6,730, which was then sold off by exchange brokers, falling back by $20. It ultimately rose by $37. Trading was brisk throughout the day, totaling about 30,000 taels. For intermonth swaps (April rolling into May), the seller, Chengji, posted 80 taels to Yongcheng, with a spread of $40, which then fell back by $10. The rise in cash prices was even faster, due to the influx of idle funds and a sudden increase in buying power. Yida sold 30 taels to Defu at a price $150 higher than the forward price. Yongfengyu sold one hundred and several dozen taels to Zhongyu at a price $155 higher. Gold firms sold 50 taels to money houses at a price $160 higher, rising to $170 higher at noon, with buyers present. In the afternoon, Chengji sold one hundred taels each to Shunyuan and Decheng at a price $160 higher, a rise of about $50. Jewelry gold reversed from falling to rising, ultimately rising by $5, calculated at $710. Customs gold and other currencies were flat.</p>
<p>Silver Rises $37</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:15 AM at $6,650 per bar (ten taels), $25 lower than last Saturday's noon closing price, due to the reopening of the Four Banks and the release of short positions. It then fell to $6,645. Suddenly, news that the US dollar had rebounded from weak to flat, with settlement difficult at $5.21875, boosted confidence. Chengji and Dafeng aggressively bought, raising the price to around $6,670. Unexpectedly, after 10:00 AM, Yiyuan, Renchengyong, Yida, Chida, and Defu all rushed to buy, raising it to around $6,690, and then fluctuating. Xinfengyong was aggressively selling, and Defu sometimes resold. After 11:00 AM, settlement was difficult at US$5.1875, and retail investors rushed to buy even more eagerly. Shihe bought three hundred and several dozen taels, raising it to $6,713. Deda, Chengji, and Xinfengyong sold in small amounts up to $6,700 at noon, closing at $6,703. The market then rose to $6,715 in the afternoon after a 2:00 PM opening, $12 higher than the noon closing price. Retail investors sold in small amounts up to $6,705. Yida and Dafeng bought, and the US dollar softened, so the price rose gradually. Shunyuan aggressively bought, raising it to $6,730. Exchange brokers Xinfengyong and Jufengyong, as well as securities houses and banks, sold off, and small amounts were seen at $6,708. The market closed at 4:00 PM at $6,712, a rise of $37 from last Saturday's noon closing. Based on the May US dollar settlement price of $5.15625, it was calculated at $6,754, a discount of $42. The price fluctuated by $85 throughout the day. The cash firm's own price was $180 higher than the spot price, buying at $80 lower than the selling price. Spot gold was not priced and inactive.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Relisted at $710</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael reversed from falling to rising. Datongxing and Xintongxing lowered it by $5 to $700 at 9:15 AM. It rebounded by $5 at 10:00 AM, and rose by another $5 at 2:00 PM, reaching $710, a rise of $5. Buying was at $40.</p>
<h3>Securities, Bond Market Again Appears Uncertain</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds saw a weakening trend immediately after opening yesterday. The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks did indeed reopen yesterday morning. Because the public bond market knew of this news last Saturday, those who were long continued to add to their positions, causing the appetite to feel satiated. After the Four Banks reopened, high-priced positions were released, so market prices reversed and fell slightly. Confidence was relaxed again. At the initial opening in the morning, it fell slightly. Tongkang, Hongda, Dasheng, Xingxie, Kangxie, and Yuanda Hua all sold. Shunchang's appetite to buy was still strong. Qia Tai Hengfu Shengda Jiufu also had needs, but the support was still weak. The noon closing fell by two or three cents. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to sell. Xie Kang Wuhe also sold a lot. Yichang, Xinming, and Hongda were all seeking to sell. Xin Feng Qia Tai Shun Chang Jiu Feng Chang Kang Yong Kang Dun Yu and Heng Kang in the market either covered shorts or went long. The amounts varied. There were all buyers. Supply still exceeded demand. Categories A and C both broke $4, Categories E and D both broke $3, and Category B also broke $6. The trend was unstable. The result was a uniform drop of 4.5 to 7.5 cents. The turnover was approximately $2 million. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 73.20 73.35 73.35 Down 0.70</p>
<p>Unified B 66.70 65.95 66.00 Also Down 0.70</p>
<p>Unified C 64.75 63.85 63.95 Also Down 0.70</p>
<p>Unified D 63.10 62.60 62.60 Also Down 0.45</p>
<p>Unified E 63.60 62.80 62.85 Also Down 0.75</p>
<p>96 6.40 —— 6.40 Also Down 0.60</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of Dahua Matches were traded at a price of $33.75.</p>
<p>The public industry stock market opened and continued to rise, then turned uncertain. High prices could not be maintained. The closing trend was still stable. Several famous stocks had "ex-dividend" prices yesterday. This should not be confused with last Friday's closing price. Although the potential of rubber stocks was strong, it was not very active.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton Dou Ma Brand Speculation, Slightly Rising with Gold Market, Hard for Miscellaneous Yarn to Sell</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned from low to high, but the actual situation showed little progress. This was because the difficulty of transportation prevented companies from moving. However, longs believed that yarn mills would inevitably reduce production due to electricity conservation issues, so the desire to go long remained firm. However, the outlet was narrow, and the two factors canceled each other out, so the market entered a period of stagnation. The high price for 20-count Dou Ma yarn was $1,496, and the low price was $1,480. Initially, it was trading at $1,492 in the afternoon. Later, it was reported that the price of silver was continuing to rise, so it rose again to $1,499. The final price was $1,495-6. Currently, the yarn market fluctuated with silver prices. However, spot transactions were rare. In short, this was not a fundamental solution. Moreover, apart from the Dou Ma standard, which was passed around, other yarn brands were more difficult to sell.</p>
<p>The Dou Ma Brand opened in the morning, and market sentiment was peaceful. In addition, the Four Banks had reopened, and speculative forces were weaker. The opening price was $1,482. It then rose slightly to $1,487. At this time, Tianjin merchants, securities firms, and others sold off, dropping it again to $1,480. It fluctuated between $1,483 for a long time. At the same time, Guangdong merchants did not trade. However, after the news that silver prices had improved, longs pulled and lifted prices, raising it to $1,496. When prices were high, profit-takers released their positions, and shorts became active, pushing the market down. The closing price was $1,492. An analysis of the amount of turnover by different merchant groups for the half-day statistics of 6,360 bales is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 120 Same Industry 6,200</p>
<p>Mainland 40 Statistics 6,360</p>
<h3>Cotton Arrivals Still Flooding In, Transactions Cold and Quiet</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is quiet and desolate. This is because recent arrivals have been crowded, and the owners all made profits and were eager to sell to avoid warehousing rent and miscellaneous fees. However, the recent environment has been unfavorable, and yarn prices are not planned, so sales are slow. Mills must oppress and reduce production due to electrical saving issues, and there are no methods for raw materials, so the market has the risk of falling. Yesterday, Shenxin and (former Guangqin) two yarn factories dealt in a little bit of coarse fleece for a total of 740 bales. Tongfeng imported 200 pieces of Brazilian cotton. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>South Taicang Cotton 208 240 Bales Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 205 and</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 207 Shenxin 2200 Bales Again</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 330 Tongfeng 200 Pieces Delivered to Warehouse</p>
<p>Another news item: the foreign cotton trade of foreign firms in Shanghai Port is still uninterested due to the impact of the current situation, but the market is still firm. Yesterday, in addition to 34 small batches of Brazilian cotton and Indian cotton, there was no other news. The New York cotton market was quiet and firm, rising due to buying and short covering. As a result, closing prices were up 2-8 points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering and continuous support from buyers, but was then pushed down by speculative profit-taking. Finally, closing prices rose again due to spot merchants buying. As a result, closing prices rose except for White Low grade going to 4-5 month rising 9 rupees and 7-8 month rising 5 rupees, the rest rose about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation will continue to rise half a rupee at the opening today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Cloth Led by Yarn Higher</h3>
<p>The trend of the factory cloth market was flat yesterday, with the market slightly firmer in the afternoon, because although cloth sales were sluggish, raw yarn suddenly saw an upward trend again. Sales prices varied. White goods, fine cloth, and western materials rose by $0.20 to $0.50 per bolt. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth, fine yarn, and line woven products were particularly firm. Inside and outside holders absorbed more. Poplin etc. rose by $0.35 to $0.50 per bolt. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded in the street. Guangdong-Hong Kong firms handled more than 100 pieces of Hua Feng blue cloth etc. Firms from abroad in Singapore and other places handled more than 6,000 bolts of bleached cloth bleached twill khaki etc. The real sales of Dongbu are still mediocre, so the rise of mid-range fine cloth is weak, but inside and outside holders show no small appetite. The price of high-end fine cloth rose by $0.40 per bolt, and the price of each brand of fine twill rose by $0.25 to $0.50. Because the 42-count fine yarn line of the Four Gentlemen brand saw a high market again, buyers flocked and supply was severely lacking, rising sharply by over $0.02 per yard. The closing price in the afternoon was $1.555.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw White Rises Again the Near and Far Months Rise Equally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was booming, and the trend rose again. In the trade association closing, the spot 24 raw white sugar opened flat, $99.80. Not long after, it jumped over the $100 mark again, trading at $101 to $102, an increase of $2. The large lot for the end of the month initially traded at $99.70 to $100, then $100.20, $101, $1.50, and $2.10, an increase of $2.10. The lot to be invoiced by the 10th of next month traded at $101.70 to $102, $102.50, $103, $103.80, closing at $103.50, an increase of $2. Taikoo Car White B traded at $105 to $105.50, increasing by $0.50. HX Dong Zhan at $96.20, Dutch Red at $76. The factory's snowy white traded at $102, and Jingming ice traded at $135. 5,800 coins of sugar arrived from Hong Kong on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Coal Indian Coal Rises Again</h3>
<p>For Indian bituminous coal, big firms started hoarding again yesterday, and spot goods were exhausted. There were not many old orders, leading the market to cross the $400 mark again, seeing a new high. Calcutta lump was being openly bid at $425, but owners were still reluctant to release their goods. Coal powder traded at $360. Indian lump coal from the street stores was $448 per ton. Only old transactions were being processed, and new customers were not being sold to.</p>

<h3>Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks All Reopened Yesterday. Security at Each Bank Entrance Extremely Strict, Market Rumors Cease and People's Hearts Stabilized</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branches of the four national banks, Central, China, Communications, and Farmers, were ordered to reopen uniformly from 9:00 AM yesterday. Since the reopening of the banks yesterday, it has confirmed that the Chinese government is determined to continue to maintain Shanghai's finances regardless of the environment. Therefore, the various unfounded rumors circulating in recent days have been shattered. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>All Branches Reopen</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank on Avenue Road was merged into the office on Baker Road for business operations. (2) The Shanghai branch of the Bank of China on Hankou Road, as well as the offices in the Eight Immortals Bridge, Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple, and Xinzha Road, and the Shanghai offices and liaison offices of the retreated branches in the occupied areas, have all reopened. (3) The Shanghai branch of the Bank of Communications on Mulling Road, as well as the branches on Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Minguo Road, and the Shanghai liaison offices of the branch offices in the Zhen and Zhejiang areas, have fully reopened. (4) The Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China on Avenue Joffre was merged into the office on Edinburgh Road for business operations.</p>
<p>Tight Security Protection by Armed Detectives</p>
<p>During the closure of each bank, safety issues were agreed upon with the concession authorities. Therefore, when each bank reopened yesterday, the police authorities dispatched six to ten armed detectives to guard each bank entrance. Strict inspections and interrogations were carried out on people entering and exiting. American troops were stationed at the entrances of the banks in the American defense zone, and two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were stationed in the A zone, all with pistols drawn, in a very tense situation. For those opened in the French Concession, many French and Vietnamese military police were also protecting, and armored vehicles were parked at the entrances. Sandbags were also piled up in important locations in each bank and iron gates were built to ensure safety.</p>
<p>50,000 Yuan in Consolation Money for Each Bank Employee Killed</p>
<p>After two deputy directors of the Bank of China were shot and killed in front of the Bank of China villa, the bank authorities deeply mourned their outstanding work performance during their lifetime. It was approved by the Chongqing head office and each was allocated 50,000 yuan in consolation money. Most of the more than 100 households of bank employees residing in the Bank of China villa have moved out. Only a dozen families are still residing there. It is heard that the dormitory has been subleased to the Japanese. The released Bank of China employees who were previously detained have returned to work and are performing their duties as usual.</p>
<p>Restore Collection and Delivery and Maintain the "Four Bottoms"</p>
<p>After the four banks reopened, all notes and drafts within the closure period will be re-registered for collection and delivery on the date of reopening. At the same time, the bank note exchange and the money industry note exchange have resumed the exchange of notes from the four banks. Anyone holding notes from any of the four banks, in addition to being able to withdraw cash from each bank, can also transfer to the bank for transfer. Therefore, legitimate Chinese and foreign businessmen have expressed unlimited excitement about the reopening of the four banks. The fact that the four banks can reopen before the Shanghai financial industry's accounting cutoff on the fourth day from the end of the month will stabilize the entire financial system, allowing various industries to operate flexibly. With the adjustment of the four banks, commercial banks and exchange houses can continue to provide loans, allowing each industry to safely get past this cutoff.</p>
<p>Rumors Cease and Hearts Stabilize</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency recently learned from the financial market that before the four banks closed, speculators in Shanghai spread rumors and aggressively hoarded foreign exchange and gold in an attempt to make profits. Now that the facts have proven that the four banks have not withdrawn and have reopened, the market rumors have ceased and hearts have stabilized. The black market exchange has been released, and the prices of various commodities have fallen. Therefore, people's livelihoods and social stability have benefited greatly. It is hoped that people in the isolated island will not easily believe unfounded rumors in the future, and will not engage in speculative transactions that violate wartime financial policies. Speculative transactions are not only prohibited by law, but also harm people's livelihoods and affect finances.</p>
<p>Maintain the Stability of the Black Market Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank restored the publication of the equilibrium tax rate and legal foreign exchange rate at 10:00 AM, and handled matters in accordance with the established policy. The British HSBC Bank's black market foreign exchange rate remained stable. The rumor that the black market exchange rate would not be maintained was thus debunked. Regarding the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, since the Sino-American and Sino-British loans were signed, the Stabilization Fund has increased by 110 million yuan, so the statutory exchange rate will be able to be sustained permanently and will not fall. As for the Shanghai black market foreign exchange, in order to take into account the business of local merchants, it will continue to be maintained and managed by the Stabilization Committee.</p>
<h3>American University Students Donate to Promote Aid to China National Fundraising to be Held on May 4th, and Congratulatory Telegram Sent to Chinese Students</h3>

All proceeds from the donation will be sent to China and donated to Chinese youth students. The union plans to send a telegram to Chinese students on that day to express admiration for their spirit of fighting hard to win freedom and equality for the country.</p>
<h3>The Remains of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan Hold a Casket Closing Ceremony, to be Solemnly Held at 11:00 AM this Morning, Over 40,000 More People Went to Mourn Yesterday</h3>
<p>Five days have passed since the martyrdom of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, and from morning to night yesterday, the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road was crowded with people, like a surging angry tide. Tens of thousands of people went to pay their respects to Xie's remains, with young students being the most numerous, and there were also many people from the business community. This phenomenon not only shows the public's admiration for national heroes, but also may be due to General Xie's sacrifice for benevolence, which has aroused an irresistible enthusiastic tidal wave of millions of people in the isolated island. The funeral committee of Xie's remains has decided to hold a casket closing ceremony at 11:00 AM this morning. It is expected that there will be even more people who go to pay their last respects to Xie. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Over 40,000 More People Went to Mourn</p>
<p>From 7:00 AM yesterday morning, crowds continuously went to pay their condolences. From 1:00 PM, it became even more crowded. In order to maintain order, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department placed barbed wire into a curved shape at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, 40 steps away. Another barbed wire fence was erected. Seven or eight western constables and many Chinese constables were directing at the scene. There were also two red police vehicles on standby at the intersection. Students were the most numerous among the crowd, and most went in collective formations. In addition, there were also many workers and Chinese constables. Wreaths, elegiac couplets, and elegiac plaques were raised high in the air. At 5:00 PM, the two barbed wire fences were knocked down, and the Singapore Road street sign was also crushed. The number of people was estimated to be around 40,000. Thanks to the effective maintenance of order by the police, no incidents occurred. After entering the camp, the crowds filed into the auditorium to pay their respects to the remains, and the order was very good.

<p>Various Suggestions for Making Statues for Commemoration</p>
<p>The Isolated Army Camp has received many suggestions from all walks of life in recent days, among which the most important is the suggestion to cast a bronze statue of Regiment Commander Xie to commemorate him permanently. Xie's glorious history is deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of Shanghai. If there is no statue, how can it express eternal thoughts? However, according to Vice Regiment Commander Lei, we deeply agree with this matter in principle. However, how to proceed will be carefully considered, and we hope that all circles will contribute specific opinions, such as fundraising methods, construction locations, etc., to facilitate the process. In addition, Xie's burial site has been decided to be temporarily in the small garden in front of Xie's bedroom. However, whether it is permanent or temporary will be decided after asking the central government and obtaining the consent of the family. However, some commercial firms have already gone to discuss it, and will send the designs in a few days, which will then be reviewed and selected. Also, there has been no news of Xie's family arriving in Shanghai as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Joint Memorial Service by All Circles in the Provisional Capital</p>
<p>Reuter News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: After Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Shanghai Isolated Army, was killed, the National Comfort Association and the various groups in the Provisional Capital have decided to hold a joint memorial service on the 10th of next month. All cinemas here today also premiered the film "Eight Hundred Heroes."</p>
<h3>Four Banks Resume Business, Price Limit Removed: Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday - Speculators Recklessly Hike Prices, Time for Decisive Government Action Is Ripe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Rice Market Management Committee received an order from Deputy Director Ho De-kui of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and immediately drafted and issued Announcement No. 193 to the market, stating that upon the order of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the China, Communications, Kincheng, and Farmers Banks have resumed business, and financial stability has been achieved. The emergency price limit of the 17th of this month is hereby lifted. From today (yesterday) onwards, merchants and civilians are permitted to determine reasonable market prices in accordance with the economic principles of supply and demand, etc. This is a special public announcement for general knowledge.</p>
<p>Raising Prices by Four or Five Yuan in One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the rice market opened, speculative activities remained rampant. Rice shops had already entered the market, but brokers had not yet appeared. The price of rice was raised by a significant four or five yuan per picul. The highest price for domestic rice reached 140 yuan per picul, and Saigon No. 1 also rose to 138 yuan. In the past week, the price of rice in the city has risen by fifteen or sixteen yuan per picul. If there is no thorough solution, the severity of the food problem will be unimaginable. Therefore, citizens hope that the authorities will take decisive action, set a strict price limit based on the cost of rice in warehouses, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Profit of Forty Yuan Per Picul</p>
<p>It is found that the main reason for the recent rise in rice prices is the hoarding and speculation by large warehouse owners. Rice shops are vying to purchase spot goods, and the general blindly follow suit. The unfounded rumors spread by speculators in the market have a significant impact, fueling the rampant price increases. On the supply side, more than 30,000 bags arrived yesterday, and more than 300 bags of domestic rice arrived in Shanghai. The city's rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing. It is found that the cost of each picul stored in warehouses and arriving daily is no more than 90 yuan. However, the current selling price has been raised to more than 130 yuan. In an instant, the profit per picul has reached more than 40 yuan. Most warehouse owners are still unwilling to sell off their stocks, and their ulterior motives are self-evident.</p>
<p>Inexpensive Hong Kong Rice Should Be Quickly Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession previously agreed with the representatives of the Hong Kong authorities in Shanghai that Hong Kong would supply the city with 250,000 bags of foreign rice per month, and the price per picul would be more than 20 yuan lower than the current selling price in Shanghai. Because it was not approved by the miscellaneous grains and bean industry, the authorities planned to sell this cheap rice directly to rice shops to reduce the burden on citizens. According to reporters, this inexpensive rice has not yet arrived in Shanghai, so rice shops are unable to purchase it and can only buy from unscrupulous elements controlling the rice market. Therefore, all sectors deeply hope that the authorities will immediately find a way to ship the rice to Shanghai as soon as possible, so that rice prices can be slightly suppressed to alleviate the difficult lives of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Associate Manager of China-US Daily News, Wen Tiansheng, Attacked - Shot Four Times, Lung Injury Severe - Still Conscious, Life Not in Danger</h3>
<p>Wen Tiansheng, associate manager and advertising director of the China-US Daily News, usually does not concern himself with politics and dedicates himself to his duties. Unexpectedly, at 10:15 yesterday morning, just as he stepped out of his residence on Gordon Road, three thugs suddenly opened fire on him. He was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital. Although his injuries are serious, his life is not in danger. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Serving as Associate Manager of China-US Daily News</p>
<p>Wen Tiansheng is a native of Jiashan, Zhejiang, and is 36 years old. He graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai. He has served as the associate manager and advertising director of the China-US Daily News for many years, and also served as the director of the business department of the Great Evening News. He has extensive knowledge and experience, and is also amiable and approachable. He usually only knows how to work diligently and be loyal to his duties, and has absolutely no political connections. However, because of his efforts in service, he has received threatening letters several times, and people have inquired by telephone, and some have even visited to inquire. Because he had no grudges with anyone, he dismissed them with a smile and did not reduce his enthusiasm for his career in the slightest. Unexpectedly, he suffered this misfortune.</p>
<p>Shot Four Times in Ambush</p>
<p>Mr. Wen's residence is located at Lane 727 (Dadel Lane), Gordon Road. He usually lives in the office building, but sometimes he goes home to visit his family. At 10:15 yesterday, Mr. Wen got up at home and planned to go to the office to work. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped out of the entrance of Lane 727, two thugs were already lying in ambush there, each with firearms. Seeing him come out, they suddenly took him by surprise, jumped out, and opened fire, firing several shots. Mr. Wen was caught off guard and was hit in four places, including both knees, which were grazed by the same bullet, only injuring the epidermis; one bullet hit his right foot; and one bullet entered from his left lower back, passed through his lung, and went straight up to his right breast. This injury is very serious. After Mr. Wen was hit, he fell to the ground at the entrance of the lane. A Sikh policeman from No. 22 heard the gunshots and caught sight of the fleeing suspects. He drew his gun and chased after them, firing several shots. The thugs also opened fire to resist arrest and eventually escaped. At this time, Mrs. Wen also heard the alarm and rushed out. At the same time, the police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate and summoned an ambulance to send Mr. Wen to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Serious Injuries, Life Can Be Saved</p>
<p>After Mr. Wen was sent to the hospital, the newspaper also heard the news of Mr. Wen's assassination, and representatives from the newspaper went to express their condolences. Armed detectives were on guard in front of Mr. Wen's ward. Visitors must first obtain permission from the hospital authorities and be searched by detectives before entering. Mr. Wen was very conscious. Although he lost a lot of blood, his temperature was not high. According to the doctor, only one of the four injuries was serious, but his life was not in danger. The bullet that passed through his lung is now in the muscle layer and can be removed at any time. However, due to excessive blood loss, it is planned to wait until his condition improves before performing surgery.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Capture Linhai - Advancing Rapidly</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries to all Shanghai-based organizations regarding the war situation along the coast of eastern Zhejiang: (1) Chinese troops captured Linhai (Taizhou) and Huangyan and are now advancing rapidly in separate directions. (2) After the fall of Yuyao, Chinese troops retreated to the area of Mazhu and Baiguan, and fighting is still ongoing. (3) Chinese troops in Cixi retreated into Daying Mountain after Japanese soldiers landed from motorboats on the Yao River towards Banpu, waiting for an opportunity to attack. (5) Japanese troops who attacked Fenghua were met with resistance from the garrison and have now retreated to Jiangkou, Xiaowang Temple, and other places. (5) The suburbs of Wenzhou are still under the control of Chinese troops, and there is also intermittent street fighting in the city. (6) During the fall of Ningbo, many shops in the Dongmen Street area were looted by hooligans. Although the Japanese army has now prohibited this, incidents of robbery and looting still occur. The Japanese side has also ordered shops to open for business within three days, but many have ignored this. The Japanese army is now occupying the old site of the county government as its headquarters. In addition, the shops in Jiangdong were looted and few escaped.</p>

<h3>Reassessment of Real Estate Values - Additional Municipal General Tax - Additional Tax Rates Determined Based on Property Type - Tax Amount to Be Adjusted After Rental Value Is Assessed</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession recently issued a notice to taxpayers regarding the collection of municipal general taxes, stating: "For the purpose of issuing a notice, the report of the Special Committee on the Study of Tax System Inequality, published in the Shanghai Municipal Council's English Gazette on Saturday, January 5, 1941, was approved at the annual meeting of taxpayers on Thursday, April 17, 1941. In accordance with the provisions of the report, tax bills are now being sent, and the main points of the report are briefly described below for the attention of all taxpayers.</p>
<p>Basis for Taxation</p>
<p>(1) Before the rental values of all properties are reassessed, the amount of municipal tax payable for all leased properties shall, from April 1, 1941, be calculated based on the rental value recorded in the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax register on June 30, 1937, which is used to collect taxes, and then increased by the percentage indicated below, depending on the type of property and its location. (2) If the rental value of premises used by owners has been assessed according to the value on June 30, 1937, and then uniformly increased by 20%, the percentage increase should be changed to be handled according to the table below, instead of a general increase of 20%. (3) Before the general reassessment of rental values, the rental value of all houses built, renovated, or added to since June 30, 1937, should be estimated according to the value on that date, plus the percentage indicated below, and the municipal tax payable should be calculated from April 1, 1941, based on the estimated rental value with the added percentage. (4) All owner-occupied premises whose rental value has not been reassessed according to the value on June 30, 1937, should promptly reassess the rental value according to the value on that date, plus the percentage indicated in the table below. Before the rental value has been assessed, the municipal tax should be collected from the owners from April 1, 1941, temporarily based on the municipal tax paid for the premises in the first quarter of the year, plus the corresponding percentage that should be added according to the table below. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council will notify the owners that once the rental value of the premises is assessed or reassessed, the tax amount paid will be adjusted, and the excess will be refunded or the deficiency will be collected.</p>
<p>Percentage Increase</p>
<p>The attached table is as follows: (A) Properties not used for residential purposes: Central District 50%, Western District within and outside the defense line 40%, outside the defense line 20%, Northern District Huishi area 25%, other parts 20%, Eastern District within and outside the boundary 20%. (B) Properties used for residential purposes: Central District 40%, Western District within and outside the defense line 20%, outside the defense line 20%, Northern District Huishi area 20%, other parts taxed according to the rental value assessed according to the 1937 value, Eastern District within and outside the boundary taxed according to the rental value assessed according to the 1937 value.</p>
<h3>Business Representatives Officially Talk with Authorities Yesterday</h3>
<p>The business labor dispute was formally discussed at the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday morning by Mr. Xing De, director of the Industrial Section, and Mr. Zhen Gaoyi, who convened the labor representatives at the Shanghai Municipal Council. Five representatives from the factory staff representatives and the distribution office staff association attended. First, Mr. Lu explained the five points raised by the representatives. After discussion, it was considered that the first point was the most important and needed detailed study.</p>
<p>Reasonable Solution Based on Commodity Prices</p>
<p>The mediator is currently asking the employers to compare the salaries from July of last year to March of this year with the commodity price index published by the Shanghai Municipal Council every month, striving for rationalization and seeking a permanent solution to avoid future disputes. The remaining points are easier to resolve. Subsequently, the labor representatives asked the employers whether important personnel of the company in Shanghai were responsible, otherwise negotiations would not be easy to progress quickly and smoothly. Mr. Lu said that he had contacted the employers and planned to complete the negotiations within a short period of time. He also said that the course of the labor dispute was quite good. After a six or seven-day strike, there was no disturbance, which was very admirable. The labor representatives stated that their attitude was that the minimum living rate published by the Shanghai Municipal Council was the standard for this request, and it seemed that there was nothing wrong with it in terms of reason. They hoped that the employers would consider the suffering of the labor and tide over the difficulties together. Otherwise, if the situation expands, the employers should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>Road Workers Make Demands</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Daily News reported that the Public Works Department of the French Concession recently dismissed 50 garbage workers, and the remaining 1,000 workers went on strike last Saturday and Sunday to protest. The Public Works Department had to hire about 150 White Russians today (28th) to work on cleaning up the garbage. It is reported that their wages are eight yuan per day. The strikers said that 50 workers were dismissed for no reason, causing a labor dispute, and made several demands to the authorities, such as increasing wages, raising rice subsidies, and rehiring the dismissed workers.</p>
<p>Small Newspaper Workers Increase Rice Subsidy</p>
<p>Due to the sharp increase in printing costs, the small newspapers in the city increased the wholesale price by two-fifths from April 1 to maintain operations. Therefore, the printing workers who print small newspapers, with the gradual increase in rice prices and the daily increase in the cost of living, could not maintain their livelihoods with their original wages and jointly requested the employers (printing houses) to increase their wages by 30%. The matter has been discussed several times in meetings between the printing house industry and the small newspaper industry to discuss countermeasures. It is now known that a concrete solution has been reached: each typesetting printing worker will be given an additional rice subsidy of 10 yuan per month by the employers. The workers, in view of the great difficulties faced by the printing houses and small newspapers, also expressed satisfaction with this response in order to achieve cooperative results. The rice subsidy will be calculated from April.</p>
<h3>Famous Artist Wu Nanyu Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>The famous artist Wu Nanyu, who specialized in calligraphy and painting, and was especially skilled in carving, could engrave thousands of needle-point small characters on a square-inch ivory plate, which could not be identified without a magnifying glass. The flowers, birds, landscapes, and figures he carved were all lifelike, with the magic of nature and the ingenuity of craftsmanship. He was famous at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, heaven did not grant him long life, and he died of asthma in his hometown of Yangzhou on the 23rd of this month, at the age of only forty-six. Everyone who heard the news mourned and regretted his passing. It is truly a great loss to the Chinese art world.</p>
<h3>More Than 4,000 Applicants for Postman Position</h3>
<p>After the deadline for applications for the postman position publicly recruited by the Shanghai Postal Administration on the 16th of this month, physical examinations began on the 21st. However, due to the large number of people, it was not possible to complete the examinations for a while. It is now known that the administration is very strict with the physical examinations for this postman position, as there were approximately 4,300 applicants, while the number of people to be hired is only between 150 and 200. Moreover, the administration's examination room can only accommodate more than 1,700 people.</p>
<h3>Problem of Detained Yugoslav Ship - Can Be Resolved in a Few Days - Port Authorities in Negotiations with Japanese and Italians</h3>
<p>The Yugoslav cargo ship "Toni Slav," was still under "protection" by Italian sailors and maritime police yesterday. According to responsible sources, the matter could be resolved in a few days. It is reported that the Jianghai Customs Port Administration, the Italian Consul, and the Japanese naval authorities are still in negotiations. The "Toni Slav" cargo ship is leased by the Yugoslav Shipping Company to transport wheat from Australia. Its Shanghai agent is the British company Jardine Matheson. The ship was still flying the Yugoslav flag yesterday. The Italian authorities insisted that the captain of the ship had voluntarily requested the dispatch of troops to "protect" the ship after Yugoslavia was captured by Nazi forces.</p>
<p>Customs Prevents Italian Action</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the Jianghai Customs maritime police dispatched a patrol team to guard the Yugoslav cargo ship "Toni Slav" today (28th) to prevent further action by the Italian authorities in this area. At the same time, Italian sailors remained on board. Although the ship was under the "protection" of Italian sailors, it was still flying the Yugoslav flag.</p>
<p>Can Be Resolved in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>It is generally believed that after the Japanese naval authorities and the Japanese consular authorities protested and the Customs authorities negotiated with the Italian authorities, the Italian sailors can be removed in the next few days. A Japanese naval spokesman announced this morning that all issues related to this matter will be almost completely resolved, but he could not say when the Italian sailors would withdraw. Customs officials also said this morning that the case would be resolved within the next two or three days.</p>
<h3>After the Bombing in Hongkou, the Japanese Side Conducted a Thorough Search - Two Theaters Were Allowed to Resume Business Only Yesterday - Public Places Take Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that after the bombing of the Rongguang and Donghe theaters in Hongkou on the afternoon of the 26th, the Japanese authorities took special precautions and ordered all theaters in Hongkou to temporarily suspend business. They only resumed business today (28th). However, Japanese military police and Japanese residents are still taking preventive measures in various theaters in Hongkou. The Japanese naval authorities continued to take measures to ensure safety in other public places in the area. It is reported that the bombing of the Rongguang and Donghe cinemas on the 16th injured about 20 people and killed several people. However, official Japanese sources said that only 16 Japanese people were injured. The Japanese authorities are now intensifying their search in the Hongkou area, and a large number of Japanese residents who have joined the security corps are assisting in the operation.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Assist in the Search</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Marines stated yesterday (27th) that after the bombing of the Rongguang and Donghe theaters on the afternoon of the 26th, all members of the Hongkou Japanese Residents' Security Corps had been mobilized to respond to the emergency situation caused by the case. The plan was for Japanese residents to be divided into small teams and stationed in shifts at various intersections in the Hongkou district designated by the Japanese Marines authorities to observe the situation. It was not stated whether these security corps would assist Japanese Marines and military police in searching houses and pedestrians. The spokesman also said that the Japanese Marines and military police, in cooperation, would soon implement strict measures, the nature of which could not be disclosed. What could be said was that searches would be carried out throughout the Hongkou area in order to find the weapons used by the perpetrators of the bombing.</p>
<h3>Rental Dispute in Lianzhuli Reaches Settlement</h3>
<p>All the tenants in Lianzhuli on Avenue Haig have been in dispute recently due to the landlord's repeated rent increases. It has been going on for a month. The lawyers entrusted by the tenants, Ling Changyan, and the lawyers representing the landlord's rental account room, Mai Jinyang, Fei Xizhen, have been working hard to mediate. The landlord has also agreed to make concessions, so both parties have agreed to a settlement. Yesterday morning, both parties signed a settlement contract at Ling's law office in the Pudong Building on Avenue Edward VII. The settlement terms are as follows: (1) All houses will continue to be leased indefinitely as before. (2) All tenants along the road will pay an additional 30% of the original rent from November 1940. (3) All tenants in the lane will pay an additional 25% of the original amount from January 1941. (4) There will be no further rent increases before the end of October 1941.

<h3>Xinfengxiang Jewelry Store Robbed of Diamond Rings Worth More Than 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At around 10 AM yesterday, a robber in a Western suit, about 30 years old, suddenly came to Xinfengxiang Jewelry Store at 580 Nanjing Road, Public Concession, and falsely claimed to be buying diamond jewelry. Partner A immediately showed the robber four diamond rings worth more than 30,000 yuan for him to choose from. The robber immediately revealed his ferocious features, put the four diamond rings in his bag, and threatened the partner with a gun, ordering him not to make a sound. Then the robber forced the partner to the door and fled into the crowd. Afterwards, the jewelry store reported the case to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Stray Dogs on the North Bank of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, in cooperation with the Japanese Consulate Police Department and the Japanese Marines, is currently engaged in clearing stray dogs from the areas on the north bank of Suzhou Creek. In the past month, police have been patrolling the streets every early morning and shooting stray dogs without owners.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Soup Kitchen (1)</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Rice is expensive, fuel is expensive, and all daily necessities are expensive. They are so expensive that some people are clapping their hands and celebrating, while countless others are drooping their heads and losing their spirits.</p>
<p>One does not know the value of rice until one is hungry. Therefore, it is best not to talk about the high price of rice to those who have rice to eat. Although rice is expensive, it is still much cheaper than candy that costs more than ten yuan per pound and Florida tangerines that cost one yuan. Those who have 10,000 or 8,000 bags of rice in their hands are still craning their necks and hoping for the price of rice to rise!</p>
<p>Only when one sees people struggling on the edge of starvation does one realize that rice is truly a life-sustaining soup, "get it and live, don't get it and die," there is no room for forcing it. Therefore, the rice that is usually taken for granted, having rice to eat, one still needs delicacies; having delicacies, one still dislikes the taste. If one's life declines directly to the level of ordinary life, if one has a sense of remorse, one will deeply regret the extravagance and waste of the past, and realize that the use of rice is much greater and more precious than all rare and exotic foods. A certain prime minister of the Ming Dynasty, extremely extravagant and luxurious, had snow-white and fat rice residue flowing from the sewer into the temple next to his mansion every day. The monks in the temple saw it and cherished it, picked it up from the sewage, washed it clean, dried it in the sun, and stored it for food. When the prime minister failed and his property was confiscated, he rented a house in the temple next to his mansion. The monks served him white rice, which he found very delicious. He told the monks, and the monks said, "This is from your house," and told him the reason. The prime minister was ashamed and regretted it to the extreme. Seeing this situation, I would like to ask those who have rice to eat and do not care about those who do not have rice to eat to cherish their blessings and quickly create blessings, and not only care about the current pleasure of the mouth, but also care about the future blessings, which is the perfect blessing!</p>
<p>I am also one of those struggling in the current difficult life; but I often comfort myself, although I am not as good as the top, I am more than enough than the bottom, but if prices continue to rise so high, our lives will inevitably decline from the usual most frugal level to below or the lowest level one day. But after visiting the soup kitchen, seeing the people eating porridge, I couldn't help but feel infinite emotion, and I didn't feel infinite comfort in my personal life.</p>
<p>I always feel that doing charity requires not only hard work but also bearing complaints, and it also requires a bit of spirit to have a percentage of effectiveness. I usually deeply admire the old charitable organizations for their good intentions and good intentions, but in terms of handling affairs and organization, they are inevitably inferior to the undertakings of public and Christian religions due to various relationships and making do with what is available. I like to visit various relief undertakings as research materials, because I believe that to treat social diseases, one must first understand the cause of the disease and the methods of treatment throughout history. But I never like to flatter people, nor do I like to be demanding. I know that "doing charity is difficult", "criticizing is easy, doing things is difficult", but since I returned from the soup kitchen yesterday, I can't help but feel that the current charitable organizations have made progress in all aspects, and it is indeed time to look at them with new eyes.</p>
<h3>Drugs Found in Abbot's Room</h3>
<p>Huabu No. 329 of the Gordon Road Police Station saw a man holding a bar of cocoa-flavored cigarettes at 6:50 the day before yesterday. His behavior was suspicious, so he stepped forward to search him. He found a package of opium dross in the box and took it to the police station. After questioning by Detective Tao Afu, he learned that his name was Lu Jinbao, 39 years old, from Shanghai. According to his confession, the opium dross was entrusted by Yun Zhao, the abbot of the Baoben Hall Temple in Changsha, to be delivered to a certain Jia in the Yinhua Lane, Xiaoshadu Road for collection. He said that he had delivered the soil three times before and after. According to the confession, the detectives went to Baoben Hall to arrest Yun Zhao, but he had already escaped after hearing the news. Only three opium pipes, six large cans of opium dross, eight small cans, seven bags of heroin, and two bags of ashes were found in Yun Zhao's room and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Lu Jinbao was escorted to Criminal Court No. 3 of the Special Court. Chiang Baolian, the police lawyer, explained the process, saying that the accomplice, the monk Yun Zhao, had not yet been arrested, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, he was ordered to be detained and retried on a later date. The seized soil was detained for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Accumulation of Thefts Near the Great World; "Little Ningbo" Arrested</h3>
<p>Xu Jinbao from Ningbo, nicknamed "Little Ningbo," 26 years old, was the leader of a gang of robbers. He resided at the Xiao Ke Inn, No. 12 Pi Shao Nai Road, outside the Little North Gate. Daily, he instigated his gang to rob gold bracelets and wristwatches from women and felt hats and clothing from men passing through the area from the Great World southward to Nanyang Bridge. The gang members handed over the stolen goods to Xu for pawn or sale, and he divided the proceeds. Xu thus reaped the benefits of a fisherman, leading a comfortable life, much like a shop owner. Detectives Gao Meiyan and Wang Dong and Detective Li Yuyuan of the French Concession Police learned of this and arrested Xu the other night. They also retrieved wristwatches, clothing, gold ornaments, and other items from various pawnshops and brought them back to the police station. They are awaiting further arrests of his fugitive gang members to prosecute them together.</p>
<h3>Owner of Dehe Pharmacy, Gao Zhiyun, Assassinated; Shot Twice at the Intersection of Yunnan Road and Died</h3>
<p>Gao Zhiyun, a native of Suzhou, 60 years old, owned the Dehe Pharmacy at No. 682, Intersection of Duoya Road and Yunnan Road. The business was doing reasonably well. Yesterday, around noon, three friends of Gao came to the pharmacy and invited him out for lunch. Gao, feeling he couldn't leave the counter unattended, went out with them. They walked slowly westward along the road. As they were talking and laughing in front of the Hot Spring Bath House newsstand at the intersection of Yunnan Road, suddenly a black-clad assailant emerged from the roadside, drew a pistol, and fired two shots at Gao. One bullet hit his foot, and the other hit his back and pierced through to his chest. Gao bled profusely and fell to the ground immediately. The assailant, seeing his purpose fulfilled, fled into the crowd on Yunnan Road. The patrol officer on duty at the intersection of Edward Avenue and Yunnan Road rushed to the scene, but the assailant had vanished without a trace. An ambulance was called to take Gao to the Guangji Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he had already died by the time the ambulance arrived at the hospital. The three friends quickly returned to the store to report the situation and then abruptly left. During the war, Gao served as the first captain of the South City Citizens' Self-Defense Force when it was organized. After the National Army moved westward, Gao focused solely on business and did not involve himself in external affairs. His sudden death is perplexing. Gao is survived by his hungry wife, Mrs. Zhang, and a young son (currently studying at a certain primary school), leaving them in dire straits.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Ministry of Education announced the cessation of unified enrollment for public universities in the 30th year. This year, each public university should handle its own enrollment regarding the unified examination system. All enrollment examination procedures have now been clearly stipulated by the Ministry of Education, instructing all universities and colleges to follow them. However, some young people concerned about the unified examination are worried that their chances of entering higher education will be affected after its cancellation. It is now learned that each university will establish application centers in Hong Kong to facilitate applications from overseas Chinese students and handle everything according to the 29th year. Since overseas transportation routes have changed, the Student's Friends Society in Chongqing has compiled and printed updated routes and notified overseas Chinese students.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Sun Yat-sen University will establish a recruitment office in Hong Kong to recruit outstanding talents from Hong Kong and Macau. Peking Yenching University is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for guaranteed admission on the 9th and 10th of next month. Outstanding students from secondary schools recognized by the university can apply to participate in the examination. The fifth district, which is the Hong Kong and Macau district, has entrusted Pui Ying Middle School to handle the guaranteed admission examination.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Improves Overseas Chinese Education; Actively Selects Teachers; Sends Orders to Hong Kong to Report Required Number of Personnel</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) In order to improve overseas Chinese schools, the Ministry of Education intends to select outstanding domestic teachers to serve overseas. Overseas Chinese schools have been specially ordered to report the required number of teachers. Overseas Chinese schools here have successively received this order, which states, "Upon investigation, overseas Chinese schools often lack teachers, and many teaching positions remain vacant, making it difficult to hire qualified personnel to fill them. Meanwhile, teachers trained domestically for overseas Chinese schools have no outlet. Under these circumstances of mismatch between teacher supply and demand, it is difficult to accelerate the progress of overseas Chinese school improvement. Hereafter, each overseas Chinese school should report the required number of teachers, subjects, teaching hours, salary, and the travel expenses the school can bear to the Ministry for the selection of excellent teachers to be sent to teach overseas. Please comply with this order."</p>
<h3>The Tonghui School Strike Takes a Sharp Turn; Resumption of Classes Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>The Tonghui Primary School strike, which has lasted four days, took a sudden sharp turn yesterday. The faculty has decided to resume classes today, ending the turmoil. People in the community are rejoicing. The reporter from Dahuashe has compiled the details as follows:</p>
<p>The Entire Faculty</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday morning, the unfortunate incident had not seen any development. However, personnel related to education strongly urged the faculty to consider the big picture and quickly resume classes via telephone. Gu Chuan-ying, the faculty representative of the school, revealed the intention to resume classes and said that preparations were actively underway. They no longer insisted on the removal of the principal. Jiang Zong-pan, the chairman of the school board, had already accepted the principles of the faculty's demands during the previous day's discussion and had no intention of refusing. However, he believed that all matters must be discussed in detail before concrete solutions could be reached, so he hoped that classes could be resumed first and then a resolution could be sought. Therefore, the opinions of both sides did not differ greatly, and the faculty deeply understood the importance of the matter. Once they changed their minds, everything was easily resolved.</p>
<p>Resumption of Classes in Normal Condition Today</p>
<p>Late yesterday evening, the faculty on strike, after collective discussion, believed that people in the community, the media, and the educational administrative authorities were all earnestly urging them to resume classes. The school board had also clearly indicated that, in addition to the investigation of the corruption case, which had already been thoroughly investigated, and the issue of the principal's removal, which was no longer to be discussed, everything else could be discussed at length. Therefore, they resolutely decided to resume classes immediately. People in the community, hearing this news, were pleased that the faculty could prioritize the overall situation and not just argue over emotions, that the school board members had taken appropriate measures, and that the administrative authorities had effectively mediated. It is also learned that Principal Tang Guoxun will also return to school today to resume his duties as usual. The school board and administrative authorities will also send personnel to express their concern. (Dahuashe)</p>

<h3>Good News for Baseball; Chinese Baseball Team to Resume This Season; Will Compete with Western Teams This Summer; Leader Li Baojun and Coach Ye Junliang Publicly Seek Team Members</h3>
<p>Baseball, originally a very reasonable and brain-training sport, had Chinese teams organized every summer before the incident. They could compete against the McLaughlin and American Amateur teams. After August 13th, the players scattered, lacking leaders, and the sport has been suspended until now. Now, Li Baojun, Ye Junliang, Shen Kunnan, Gu Degang, and others from the sports community have discussed the matter many times and decided to revive the Chinese Baseball Team this year. Li Baojun has been publicly elected as the leader. Ye Junliang, a famous overseas Chinese baseball player from Honolulu, USA, and two US Navy officers who previously coached the Chinese team will jointly serve as coaches. It is heard that the team's funding has been enthusiastically raised by Lou Longhou, director of the Taiping Life Insurance Company. The team is expected to be formed this summer and plans to participate in the Shanghai League as usual. In order to broaden the recruitment, team members are now being publicly sought. There are many overseas Chinese and talented players from various schools residing in Shanghai who will surely participate enthusiastically.

<h3>Shan Kun Cup Small Ball Performance Match; Fu Lai Defeats Mixed Team</h3>
<p>The Shan Kun Cup Charity Small Ball Tournament concluded the day before yesterday. When Samsung and Wenbin competed to the intermission, the match ball was auctioned off on the spot. Zhong Wenji, the deputy manager of the good old Times Foreign Company, purchased it for 300 yuan, the highest price. The benevolent gesture is admirable. The match ball was signed by movie star Chen Yanyan. All ticket revenue from that day will be handled by personnel sent by the Refugee Orphanage. Detailed accounts will be announced within days. Also, according to Wei Shigeng, the host of the match, yesterday's news was slightly inaccurate. The performance match had Xu Shi-lai defeating the mixed team 2-1, not the mixed team defeating Shi-lai.</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>Recently, the German authorities, in order to investigate the luminosity and projection distance of various lights during blackout, specially conducted various experiments by scientists. The results revealed that a burning match can be seen from half a mile away, a street lamp can be seen from one and a quarter miles away, and indoor light shining through a window can be seen from twelve and a half miles away. Therefore, on blackout nights to guard against air raids, even a tiny spark is significant.</p>
<p>A mere matchstick, something smokers burn in seconds, hardly anybody would have expected that it can shine as far as half a mile away in the dark.</p>
<p>Therefore, a tiny spark, if not handled properly, can cause a great disaster.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a tiny spark can also be a guiding light for travelers in the dark. This immediately made me think of elementary and secondary school teachers who are living the hardest lives in today's society. They are emitting small points of light in the darkness. In the deep night, this is not entirely in vain.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Tactics in Nature</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Since "struggle for life" is the biggest argument of evolutionism, it is also a universal phenomenon in nature. Therefore, every species has its own special tactics. Now, let's not talk about the plain ant "trench warfare," the weasel catching chicken "ambush warfare,"... nor use "the eagle preys on the birds" as a metaphor for "air combat," but pick a few things that ordinary people don't pay attention to to talk about.</p>
<p>Nerve Warfare</p>
<p>According to the great scientist Thomson's statement: weak organisms use mimicry or camouflage to avoid attracting the attention of enemies; while powerful or highly poisonous things, on the other hand, exaggerate and flaunt their physique, colorful patterns, etc., to show their fearlessness, so as to make enemies panic and tremble, achieving their own purpose of winning without fighting. For example, those venomous snakes and pythons with splendid scales and all five colors are excellent examples. This means of displaying troops and showing off force and intimidating with empty threats can be called nerve warfare.</p>
<p>Evading Air Raids</p>
<p>The peanut blooms on the ground and is fertilized on the ground, but in order to caress and protect its precious seeds, it must let them deeply burrow into the underground layer: if we interpret this with the biggest rule in biology, "teleology," isn't this very obviously to avoid the air raids of those gluttonous birds? As for all other tuber or root plants, can they also be measured in this way?</p>
<p>Setting Traps</p>
<p>For a plant to want to eat an animal, for something that cannot move to want to eat something that can fly and leap! Then, what other good way is there than to use sweet bait to lure the enemy into one's own trap? The Venus flytrap has leaves covered with thorns on the edge of its fan, but as soon as that unlucky insect falls into the area, it immediately snaps shut with interlocking teeth, making it truly impossible for them to fly! The pitcher plant opens its lidded "jar" that is half-filled with clear water, and the cobra lily opens its "bottle" with dense inward-pointing hairs that are full of mucus: as long as greedy, reckless things come to patronize their nectar, well, one slip and you slide into the inside, immediately there is a lid to cover, and hairs to block, this is called able to get in but unable to get out!</p>
<p>Posting Sentries</p>
<p>Deer, we know, are animals that like to live in groups and lead a collective life. They gallop and roam together during the day, and rest and sleep together at night, but when they are sleeping, there must be one or two night watchmen patrolling and watching near everyone to prevent the enemy from raiding and plundering the camp. If there is a bit of wind or grass movement and the situation is suspicious, they will hiss and call out to alert all of their companions. Isn't this exactly like the sentries we post when we humans are marching?</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>The herds of elephants in tropical Africa give us a very clear impression of battle formation. When they forage or rush to the water source in groups, they are always led by the oldest and most experienced elephant, and the rest follow closely in a single line. The leading elephant often holds its nose high in the air: the rest follow with their eyes fixed on its "trunk"! Even when encountering enemies, whether charging or retreating, it is all directed by that raised nose: what else is this but a commander-in-chief?</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Hens' Teeth Not Rare</h3>
<p>— Song Cheng</p>
<p>Recently, a household in Wusong Town raised a rooster that suddenly laid eggs, and this news spread as a marvel. In fact, according to biology, it is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>Why is there a distinction between male and female? Regarding this question, many biologists have used many methods and done many years of research. One type of research is done with microscopes. The results of this research found that it is related to a special chromosome in the cell - the sex chromosome (Sex Chromosome). However, sometimes an abnormal state of half-female and half-male is produced, called intersex. The reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics of intersex organisms are somewhat like female and somewhat like male. Why do organisms have this intersexuality? To give a biological explanation: every organism's body has two tendencies, one is to develop towards femaleness, and one is to develop towards maleness. If maleness is stronger, it becomes male. If femaleness is stronger, it becomes female. If the developmental forces of femaleness and maleness are equal, this organism will exhibit intersexuality.</p>
<p>If the strength of the male and female forces in the body changes, and the original stronger force becomes weaker, the sexuality of this organism seems to be able to be reversed. Recently, many species of animals have been discovered that can indeed change from female to male, or from male to female. This type of phenomenon is called sex-reversal. Someone experimented: after castrating a rooster, the male-style comb, wattles, and feathers cannot fully develop; after castrating a hen, the nature of a rooster can be expressed instead. A hen crowing in the morning is an abnormal thing, and it is also a very common thing to see. Someone carefully investigated this phenomenon and found that a hen, after laying eggs and hatching chicks, had her ovaries destroyed by tumors, and then gradually grew testicles, emitted rooster-style crowing, showed rooster-style combs and wattles, changed into rooster-style feathers, and, most notably, could mate with hens. This is clear evidence.</p>
<p>Now, the news of a rooster laying eggs is the opposite of the above example, and this rooster is tending towards femaleness. The rooster's testicles have probably been destroyed, and ovaries have grown, and it has laid eggs. This is undoubtedly a sex-reversal phenomenon, and it is definitely not an ominous sign.</p>
<p>Human Affairs</p>
<h3>Humans Eating Humans</h3>
<p>— Zuo You</p>
<p>Primitive peoples often killed and cooked the old and weak people in their tribes to fill their hunger due to lack of food. However, in addition to being forced by hunger to cannibalize each other, there are also some barbaric peoples who engage in the cruel act of eating people for various different reasons.</p>
<p>In the wilderness of Africa, as well as in the islands of the South Seas and the Pacific, there are many merciless natives who are very fond of eating human flesh. It is said that these natives feel that no animal meat is as palatable as human flesh, so whenever they capture an enemy or traveler, they salivate and desire to eat him, and will not give up until they kill and devour him. In the Mexican region of America, there is also a type of native who actually treats the captives they catch as livestock. Every time they return from war, they carefully select the enemies they have captured, and kill and cook the fat captives first, using them as a grand feast at their victory banquet. As for the remaining thin captives, they are fed and fattened, and then killed again after their bodies have become fat.</p>
<p>In Sumatra, there is a semi-civilized tribe that believes that after people die, they will run to a very happy paradise; however, before reaching paradise, they must first pass through a very dangerous and narrow single-plank bridge. Below the single-plank bridge, there is a ten-thousand-foot abyss, and elderly and weak people who walk on the bridge will accidentally lose their footing and fall down, never being able to enter that paradise. Therefore, the filial children and grandchildren in this tribe, in order to enable their parents to pass smoothly through that narrow single-plank bridge after their death, will kill and cook them before their parents become too old. When these filial children and grandchildren are eating their own elders, they must also hold a grand ceremony. They first invite all their relatives and friends to observe the ceremony, and then send their elderly parents to a tree. Then everyone gathers under the tree to dance and sing. After singing for a while, several people shake the tree trunk with all their strength. The elderly people climbing on the tree cannot support themselves and fall from above. Then everyone rushes up and cuts the half-dead elderly people into two sections with knives. One section is cooked and shared with the guests, and the other section is thrown into the wilderness, allowing birds and beasts to peck at it.</p>
<p>A good-fighting tribe of red people in northern America likes to cook and eat human hearts. They believe that after eating human hearts, they will increase their courage in battle, so every time they kill a person, they must dig out this person's heart and liver, roast them over a fire, cut them into thin slices, and distribute them to the warriors to enjoy.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a black people tribe in the interior of Africa that often kills criminals and then distributes the meat of the dead to everyone to cook and eat, but they usually do not eat human flesh.</p>
<p>In the past, the uncivilized tribes in the border of our country also had the behavior of eating human flesh. The upper reaches of the Jinsha River contain many silver mines, and the Golog people in that area make a living by mining silver. However, their mining technology is quite rudimentary, so they often get very little silver. The Golog people then believe that this is because the local Han people have angered the god of the mine, so whenever they see a Han person, they try to capture him, kill him to worship the god of the mine, and then share the skin and flesh of the dead.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouhe</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Scratched on the Face</p>
<p>Both Chief Garrison Officer Yuan and his nephew were gone. A young servant was watering flowers in the courtyard. Upon seeing Qiu Haitang enter, he dropped the watering can and rushed anxiously into the inner room.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang took off his long coat and sat bored on a rosewood swivel chair, constantly thinking about his sick daughter.</p>
<p>This room was very close to Ai Bao Fan's main house. Although Qiu Haitang had never been there, he deduced that Xiangqi's bedroom must be at most a row of houses away.</p>
<p>He had been sitting for less than a minute when he seemed to hear many people's voices inside, a chaotic uproar, as if someone was shouting loudly, and others were crying. Boards were stomping deafeningly, mixed with the cries of a small child who was extremely frightened, as if a full-blown martial arts play was being staged in the room at the back of the building.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang's heart began to pound, but even when he stood at the window, he couldn't hear Xiangqi's voice.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the young servant who had rushed in earlier came out again, but he no longer watered the flowers. Instead, he sat silently on the stone steps, turning his head to look at Qiu Haitang every now and then, with an extremely suspicious expression.</p>
<p>"What's going on inside, causing such an uproar?" Qiu Haitang couldn't help but ask him first.</p>
<p>"Nothing much," the young servant said with an embarrassed look. "Please sit for a while, the Commander will be out soon."</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang was trying to calm his mind when he suddenly heard a scream from inside, followed by a thud, making the voices even more chaotic. That scream was so shrill and high-pitched that he immediately knew it came from a woman's throat. Although he had never heard Xiangqi scream like that, he couldn't be sure it was her, but who else inside would dare to scream like that? (93)</p>

<h3>The Lucky Me "Charlie"</h3>
<p>— Shen Fu</p>
<p>Mention Charlie McCarthy, and a natural smile is bound to appear on the lips of movie fans. That strangely shaped wooden kid, speaking in an old-fashioned, playful manner, makes people laugh with every move.</p>
<p>There are many detailed reports about the activities of many Hollywood stars, scattered throughout newspapers and magazines. Here, the author introduces a bit about Charlie McCarthy, hoping to be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>Body and Appearance—Charlie McCarthy's agile body is thirty-eight inches tall and weighs forty pounds. In addition to his original head, Charlie has several substitute heads and five or six bodies. The original head was carved by a manager named Mike in a Chicago bar and sold to Edgar Bergen—Charlie's owner, Charlie's soul, that guy whose hair is slicked back and who is inseparable from Charlie, is thirty-seven years old this year, a Chicago native, Charlie has rosy cheeks and messy, coarse red hair. His face has a unique quality that cannot be replicated. When broadcasting on the radio, he is covered with cellophane (transparent paper) to prevent his skin from being damaged by the wind. Bergen tried to carve several others in the same style, but failed many times. So, he had to insure Charlie for $5,000. When Charlie travels, he must buy a full ticket because the insurance company requires him to occupy a compartment so he can be locked inside. A few years ago in New York, one of his substitutes was kidnapped, causing a national uproar. But Bergen himself knew that the real Charlie was safely hidden in a vault at a bank in Hollywood.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Reputation—Charlie recently went to New York to broadcast, and 60,000 people requested tickets to visit the broadcasting studio. When he got off the train at Grand Central Station, many photographers held their cameras high above their heads, squeezed through the crowd, and shouted, "Tell that guy to move aside!" That "guy" was Bergen. There was a Charlie McCarthy Day at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco and the New York World's Fair. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Charlie with a wooden Oscar statuette.</p>
<p>Income Overview—Charlie's income is five times that of President Roosevelt. Just for using his name as a trademark for alarm clocks, shirts, dolls, and many small toys, he is paid $100,000 each year.</p>
<h3>Liu Tianhong Has Elegant Tastes</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhuang</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Shuyi, art name Tianhong, comes from a prominent family in Hunan Province (Governor-General Liu Kunyi is his uncle). Because of his love for opera, he became a performer. Mr. Liu is exceptionally talented, surpassing ordinary children. At the age of five or six, he was already able to perform on stage, and at the age of eight, he was already performing as the leading actor at the Gong Wu Tai. His performance in the opera "Crying at the Ancestral Temple" was highly praised by opera enthusiasts and is still admired today. In the spring of 1927, Mr. Liu left Shanghai and went north to study under Mr. Yu Shuyan. After three years of diligent study, his art had reached a high level of accomplishment. He occasionally performed in the old capital (often collaborating with Xun Huisheng), and his reputation was excellent. Newspapers unanimously praised his art, saying that Mr. Liu's artistry was superior to others in its elegance and refinement. Operas such as "Zhan Taiping," "Zhuliangzhai," and "Wenqiao Naofu" were deeply imbued with Yu Shuyan's authentic style. From these few words, one can see the extent of Mr. Liu's achievement. Later, due to a failing voice, he angrily changed his profession. However, in his spare time, he still could not forget his passion for vocal music. Singing loudly, he still retained the charm of his former performances. Famous amateur singers such as E Lügong, Xiao Shui, and Sun Yangnong all praised him, saying that Mr. Shuyan was the only one who understood the "rhyme" of singing opera, other than Mr. Liu. Recently, the Golden Stage authorities invited Mr. Liu to make a guest appearance, and Lügong especially encouraged him. Mr. Liu jumped up and said, "Living in seclusion is boring, and I feel lonely. Trying out my voice would be a great pleasure." Therefore, without hesitation, he readily agreed. Pure and refined music, playing ancient tunes alone. I know that those who admire Mr. Liu's reputation but have not heard him sing will be excited to hear this news and listen to his elegant performance with great pleasure.</p>
<h3>A Few Words on "Cao Cao Captured and Released"</h3>
<p>— Ruo Shui</p>
<p>Recently, whether in the South or the North, almost every "Tan-style Lao Sheng" often stages the opera "Cao Cao Captured and Released." The entire opera "Cao Cao Captured and Released" is divided into four acts: the Courtroom, the Road, Killing Lü, and the Inn. Currently, most performances only include the Road, Killing Lü, and Inn acts, and some even only perform the Road and Killing Lü acts, omitting the beginning and end, the Courtroom and Inn. Since Cao Cao is neither "captured" nor "released," this greatly contradicts the title and plot of the play. The sin of laziness is difficult to tolerate in the rules of opera.</p>
<p>Those who perform "Cao Cao Captured and Released" today, such as Yan Jupeng, Tan Fuying, Yang Zisen, Xi Xiaobo, and Zhou Xiaotian, all achieve good results, with Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen performing the best. Yan Jupeng's voice narrowed and his singing became strange in his later years, so he is not considered.</p>
<p>The difficulty of "Captured and Released" lies not in the heavy singing, but in the fact that it goes from Xipi to Erhuang. Erhuang is deep and mellow, with an aged tone, which is not suitable for those with poor voices, because it involves many low notes. Xipi is more fluent and high-pitched, and can be assisted by falsetto, and long interludes can be used for rest, because the interlude of Xipi is longer than that of Erhuang. Therefore, it is easier to sing Xipi before Erhuang, but if one sings Erhuang after Xipi, there are few who do not become hoarse. Moreover, three Erhuang sections follow one after another, with each section more intense than the last, leaving no room for rest. Therefore, those whose voices are not solid and whose breath is not sufficient dare not sing "Cao Cao Captured and Released" lightly. However, those who perform "Cao Cao Captured and Released" today only perform the Road and Killing Lü acts, avoiding difficulties and being lazy, and their faults cannot be excused.</p>
<p>In the past, Gui Fen and Tan Xinpei were both famous for this opera, which can be called a masterpiece. In addition, the Kui-style Lao Sheng Shuang Kuoting was also good at it, with a unique style. After Tan's death, there were very few followers of Gui Fen, with Wang Fengqing being the closest, with a hint of Wang's sad and passionate spirit. There were many performers of this opera in the Tan school, but none were as refined and tasteful as Luo Xiaobao. Now that Luo has passed away, and Yu Shuyan's voice is too thin, the remaining ones such as Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen are still passable, but they are far from their predecessors.</p>

<p>Chapter Seven: Why Are Attacks on Cities and Killing Generals So Turbulent?</p>
<p>At this time, Li Xin's circumstances had changed, and his mentality had also changed accordingly. On the one hand, he admired Hong Niangzi's charm, and on the other hand, he was grateful for Hong Niangzi's rescue. He stepped forward and bowed deeply to Hong Niangzi, saying: "All my past actions were wrong, I beg your forgiveness. I am deeply grateful for your selfless rescue yesterday, and I will never forget your great kindness." Hong Niangzi turned her head and smiled, saying: "Do you only now realize my sincere intentions? You are such a heartless person! I treated you with all my heart, with tenderness and affection, to win your favor. Who knew that you would betray me and run away, not even looking back? Isn't your heart too hard? Ever since you went down the mountain, I have been very worried and immediately sent scouts to Qixian to inquire about news. It was only when the scouts returned that I learned that you had been framed by the magistrate of Qixian and imprisoned. This is you walking into the trap yourself. I originally wanted to come and save you, this ungrateful and heartless person, but I thought that although you were indifferent and unkind to me, you still had no malice, otherwise you could have abandoned me and killed me to report your merits. But you were unwilling to harm me, you are still not ungrateful or unjust. Moreover, you were imprisoned because of me. If I don't come to save you, who else will save you? Therefore, after discussing it with my brother, we decided to go down the mountain to rescue you. I and twenty of my men and children disguised ourselves and infiltrated the city to rob the prison first. My brother led a large force to attack the city afterward, acting in two groups. Now I am happy to have rescued you, and your hatred has been avenged. We have come to Qing Shi Mountain again. From now on, will your heart still waver and change? Do you still dislike me for being a female bandit and are unwilling to marry me?" When Hong Niangzi said this, Li Xin had already grasped her soft hand and said: "I dare not, I dare not. I now recognize you as a heroine among women, a paragon of chivalry, how dare I treat you like a bandit again? I fully accept your love. Moreover, I have nowhere to go. Don't worry. I will never have any other intentions again. I sincerely wish to marry you and grow old together. Heaven and the sun are above, I, Li Xin, vow to be a loyal subject. Don't worry." (50)</p>
<h3>An Outline of the Philosophy of Practical Action</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>There are various kinds of movement: mechanical movement, which is often characteristic of inanimate objects; instinctive movement, which is often stimulated by physiological needs; emotional movement, which is often unsustainable; rational movement, which is often unwavering or reckless; and volitional movement, which is the highest realm of movement.</p>
<h3>Li Amao's Health Mailbox</h3>
<p>(Hong Ye asks) My wife has had kidney disease for many years. We have been married for three years and she is now pregnant. I don't know if there will be any danger during childbirth?</p>
<p>(Answer) Please consult an obstetrician for monthly check-ups.</p>
<p>(Li Mei asks) There are sores on my buttocks that have now healed, but there are scars. Can they be treated?</p>
<p>(Answer) Scars on the buttocks do not detract from beauty. This thing is never seen by guests, so why treat it? And beauty experts may not be willing to accept it.</p>
<p>(Wang San asks) Where can I buy "Ying De Meng"?</p>
<p>(Answer) At drugstores or Jiufu Company.</p>
<p>(Mei Jun asks) I sweat a lot and am afraid of heat in the summer, and my hands turn yellow. But I am not fat. How can I treat this? Is liver fire related to fear of heat?</p>
<p>(Answer) Sweating a lot, being afraid of heat, and having yellow hands are related to your constitution. There is no way to treat it. If your liver fire is strong, you can take a small amount of fruit salt every morning.</p>
<p>(He Yiming asks) My wife is healthy but has a lot of leukorrhea. What causes this?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are many causes of leukorrhea. It is best to consult a doctor for an examination.</p>
<p>Masturbation and nocturnal emission shorten life. Only "Ying De Meng" can cure them.</p>
