<p>華盛頓　美國在太平洋空軍力量之加强、今日大見喧騰、因聞陸軍總參謀馬歇爾將軍昨日在參院軍事委員會發表聲明故也、據云、馬歇爾將軍吿該委員會稱、陸軍部將以若干速降轟炸機暨其他飛機轉讓海軍、令海軍部太平洋艦隊之航空母艦達到戰時之力量、馬塞爾將軍辯證稱、遠東之局勢促成此種行動、並謂、「美國應準備應付仟何事件」、渠云、此種飛機讓渡的在一百架以內、聞渠米論及菲律濱問題、渠對英國勝利之可能表示樂觀、而對美國國防程序之進展亦感滿意云、（廿一日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間昨日得悉、美陸軍參謀長馬歇爾將軍曾在參院軍委會秘密會議席上報吿、英美現正趕派飛機、以加强太平洋空防、至于美機突將派往何處、馬參謀長拒不宣布、衆信新加坡爲其目的地、英在遠東最遠之前哨香港、傳亦將派機若干架前往防衛、據指稱、香港開德機塲（譯音）大可利用、秘密會議結束後、據稱該計劃正由英美軍事領袖「完全合作」、予以縝密之考慮、（二十一日國際社電）</p>

<h3 id="c3">全國之糧食管理 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>全國糧食由中央設官專司，管理產耗，調劑盈虛，此制此議，推考始倡迄今殆已逾十載；然興替更張，名賓責權輒多參差，其制遂末由確立。及外患侵尋，人民播遷，食指集中於農事落後之區，價格飛漲於供求相違之下，於是糧食管理局應運而生，先自中樞，推設各省，分頭理處，不無成效；近者，更召集全國糧食會議，以本月二十日開幕於重慶，是極關重要之創舉也。民食大事也，政本也，積數千年放任之歷史，在長時期抗建之階段，困苦艱鉅，遭遇空前，夫安望於草創一局。召集一會，便得舉重若輕，迎刃而解？是則舉國所渴望於此會議者，未宜甚奢，要在期會議以妥制方案，而耕者販者銷者食者必與政府忠誠合作，始有效驗可覩也。</p>
<p>政府對於糧食、管理之最大目的，在於全民足食：管理之必要條件，在於旣不傷農，又不病商，而糶食代價之不悖情理。若偏重消費者之便利，但求糧價低落，則農商並受其困矣。若偏重生產懋遷者之利益，任以操縱居奇，則民食深受其害矣。勢若衝突矛盾，事必並顧兼籌，此其要諦即在察其相反而策以相成。務使耕者利於耕而樂耕，販者利於販而樂販，食者則不難一飽。其義甚簡，日平曰準，平則如衡而無所軒輊，準則如繩而無所偏頗。雖然，談何容易。蓋糧食由產而運而儲。有待逐步管理，且必統盤管理，其繁瑣艱鉅，殆難言語形容，然而此僅管理之一面而已，人口本以靜態爲常，而抗建之非常時期則以急劇之動態爲常；糧食隨人口，是以所以管理之者。豈閉門造車所得濟事，豈有不變之道足以應變，其難可想而知；然而此亦僅管理之一面而已。凡於產量之豐歉，運輸之遠近通塞，儲備之斟酌吞吐，人口在地區之動靜消長，皆能嘹如指掌矣，允必分別玫核一般生活情况，因時因地，在小傷農不困商不病民之條件之下，制定合情合理之價格，慎防買賣制度之下，有關分配性質之凡百可能的流弊；此又糧食管理中極重要之一面也。故曰談何容易。</p>
<p>姑勿奢談理想之近代管理制度。中國民食之當前大患，根本在於產量不足。此以每年必須洋米進口，可作最簡明之鐵證；然國家歷來旣屬未嘗加以管理，則全國各地豈必絕無腐蝕之糧食？故每年進口之總數量，未必即爲全國每年生產消耗不足之相差量。究竟每年必須進口若干，必須如何進口始得减輕國民經濟之損失，管理對象，此其一也。歷來各地官廳與商會以及其他公團，亦輒於其地之糧食，各自爲政；意氣爲之，小利私之，盲目赴之，此不足以稱所謂糧食管理。蓋目光限於一隅，不足則似乎立即餓殍載道而呼籲無門，此猶情有可原，抑呼籲無門即是全國糧食未經管理之故；若乃並非不足，且求其有餘，以爲此乃一地之富厚從容也，於是以封境阻遏其外流，以抑價誇稱所謂造福民生；而不知穀賤傷農實爲農村破產之主因之一，不知靳其所餘而不以補救他地之不足實爲不道德不經濟之允。如何掃蕩此類封建意識之作爲。如何破除畛域私利之褊見；管理對象，此又一也。今日之民食情况，僅聞稱饑稱貴，似乎不足語於所謂積儲。然廣義之積儲。初非闢倉廩。備饑荒而己，若糧市之虛實，季節之衡量，是積儲有關之一面也，每察各地遇有所謂糧食問題者，市面必混亂，人心必恐慌，市儈米蠹更推波助瀾，攫致厚利；於是如平糶焉，限價焉，似乎救濟有道，管理有方，攷其實效如何，儘多疑問；却復有僞善以掩其大惡者焉，弄法以牟其大利者焉，其罪不可恕，其奸不易除，然試作最簡單之疑問曰，市面究有積儲幾何，則每每爲恐慌中極難獲得之答案，於是恐慌是否恰如其分，遂爲局外所無從窺知；如此現象，安得補救？是調査積儲爲積儲之先決，亦管理之初步也；此管理對象又一也。糧食管理是全國大問題，安得經此决會議而使此凌亂之局面，稍見涯涘乎！</p>

<p>重慶　（續昨）第三是普及節的儲蓄、節的本是廉潔的前提，應該貫澈於衣食住行、以及平時一切的生活上、當此戰時、大家怎麼能忘却前方將士的浴血苦戰、而不知道加强刻苦、勝利愈接近、抗建工作必然更辛苦、軍需民生一切來源必然更艱難、爲公爲私、我們不但應節的、並應努力於儲蓄、我們要革除舊習、要維持生活、耍救濟同胞、要復興國家、就不能不節的、須知節的纔能使物盡其用、纔能使家不貧乏、</p>
<p>國有餘財也纔能適合戰時的道德標準、節的也可說是重於生產、而且可以促進生產、至於儲蓄的意義、更應該推而廣之、不但要儲財、而且要愛物、近世文明國家的兒童敎育、多以搜集廢物當作一件愛國的美德、以利用廢物當作一種愛國的常識、無論廢銅爛鐵、積累善用、可以改進機械、就是破布碎紙、一草一木、亦沒有一件不是有用的原料、我們不僅要愛護公物、允當獎勵同胞搜集廢物、指導同胞利用廢物、這更是廣義的節的和儲蓄、要知道只有厲行節的儲蓄、纔可以養成簡樸的風尙、如此直接的就能</p>
<p>醫治我們民族「奢」與「貪」的病根、而間接的更可消除「盜」與「娼」的惡風、且得造成廉恥的風尙了、第四是推進衛生體育、一般人看到我國近百年來國勢的凌夷、和四十年來日人對我國的侵略、就自認我們中國是一個弱的民族、以爲弱是我們民族一種本來的病根、我決不承認我們中華民族是一個弱的民族、但我所憂所恥的、只是我們各個國民體格之弱、就一般來說、也只弱在體格、而在精神上、大家看我國歷史上丈夫死義、匹婦殉國的例子、固然很多、就是這次作戰中間、慷慨節烈的事實、那更多了、譬如最近上海申報編輯金華亭的殉國、就是一個壯烈的事實、這三年多以來、我們各地同胞、不論</p>
<p>男女老幼只馮着我們一腔愛國的熱忱和血肉之軀、都能不避艱險、在轟炸焚燒、砲燬槍刺、火光漫天、血腥遍地之中、經年累月、夜以繼日、連續不斷的、非常悲慘的生活之下、誓死不屈的堅忍奮鬭、更能沉着堅定的如常工作、這種刀鋸鼎鑊甘之如飴、動天地而泣鬼神的事實表現、更足以證明我們中華民族、黃帝子孫、在世界上具有最忠勇、最堅强的一種國民性、那裏是衰弱呢、那裏是怯懦呢、如果我們全國同胞的體格能够更强健更堅實、那我們民族必能發揮他更强烈更勇猛的精神、自不待言、乃可惜今日一般國民、有並不勞動而多病的、有尙在少壯而先衰的、各個國民的「病」和「弱」、實在是我們民族最可遺憾的大恥、推究他的原因、多由於</p>
<p>不知衛生不重體育、新生活在衣食住行各方面、本來都以衛生爲重要原則、對於國民體育的普及、歷年都作爲重要工作之一、今後不單要使各級學校特別注重體育、就是一切機關商店工廠農村、無論老幼男女、由私人以及於公共塲所、都要普及衛生淸潔的習慣、更應該使每一個同胞、都知道他要有一種適當的健身運動、來改善個人的體格、增進民族的健康、必須這樣纔能洗雪「東方病夫」、「老大中國」各種稱號的恥辱、纔能造成一個富强康樂的現代國家、而且只有增進國民體格、纔能醫治我們民族「惰」與「怯」的病根、養成我們整潔迅速確實的精神、而確立了國家社會禮義的風尙、（十八日電未完）</p>

<h3 id="c40">國際軼事（六）　歐美四傑印象記 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>美國第著名作家桃樂賽湯普生（Dorothy　Thom　pson）久駐歐洲，担任紐約Herald　Tribune報通訊員多年。因職務上的關係，常與各國朝野名人相晋接，以其精審的觀察，發爲輕淸流利的報吿文學。每有寫述，不脛而走，實爲女記者中佼佼者。木文係湯普生女士對於目下歐美舞臺邱吉爾，希特勒，史太林及羅斯福四巨頭的剪影，精警透澈，文筆動人，爰爲迻譯如次：</p>
<p>世界上地位最重要的要算羅斯福，邱吉爾，希特勒，和史太林了。他們究竟是何等樣人呢？我所知於他們的，其中三人乃由我親自體騐而來。史太林我從來沒有見到過。但是我曾和羅期福，邱吉爾，及希特勒相晤談，也許我所獲得的印象，對於已經講到他們的幾種著作上尙能稍有增益之處。又因我有一位消息非常靈通的朋友，曾和史太林相交甚深，或者我更能在受人誤解的史太林個性上，亦有一二貢獻。</p>
<p>邱吉爾之爲人，熙明和煦，最合乎中庸之道。雖則出自愛爾蘭和美國人的血統（按邱吉爾的母親是美國人），他是十足的一個英國人。從任何一方面來講，邱吉爾和希特勒兩人恰處於相反地位。希特勒出身寒微；邱吉爾却是英國的「天潢貴族」。希特勒少年時十分坎坷。邱吉爾則從小就度着錦繡生活，養尊處優。</p>
<p>邱吉爾是一個落拓的貴族。因爲他才華絕世，放浪不羈，不受階級觀念的的束。利祿兩字無動於中，他所念念不忘的祗是文明而已。他所異於一般貴族的地方就在他對於一般民衆並無畏葸的心理。如果弄到不得了的地步，他寗可看見英國共產化，而不願受人奴役</p>
<p>邱吉爾是射手宮星座的星宿下凡。仁腸俠骨，赤心爲國，堪稱前無古人。他在英國史上最危險的階段肩起了重任，明知其不可爲而爲之，到現在還是奮力的做去。我不信他的頭腦中曾有一分鐘的時間，想到英國會戰敗。要是他曾這樣的想過，那沒在去年六月法國解體之後，英國準就一敗塗地了。但是他從未一卸仔肩，他信賴英國偉大無窮盡的人力；他信賴不可以常理測度的英人性格；他史信賴着一片至誠所寄託的英吉利。邱吉爾具有一種超過時間的精神上好像他格調卓絕的散文演說，有似數百年前古文一般。沒有一個人，能像邱吉爾的善於喚起先民的偉大精神——莎士比亞，雪萊，納爾遜，德萊克——以振奮民氣和愛國熱忱。</p>
<p>希特勒呢他對於一般羣衆，具有一種偉大的號召力，這是他的特長。這種左右他人的力量，從何而來，極難索解。這種力量好像催眠術，更恰當些，可以稱爲一種魔力。他有驅使民衆的力量，允其能使廣大的民衆能發在似的跟從他。譬如多數德國婦女都以爲他是一個美男子。</p>
<p>我曾經和希特勒會見半小時，在這三十分鐘之間，我極審愼的仔細去看他，希望能獲得一個深切難忘的印象。他身長的五呎十吋，但是因爲週身不甚均勻，看上去總覺得矮些。他上半身比腰以下爲長。他胸部微塌，肩膀略渾。站着的時候樣子很不好，腹部隆起，兩腿稍曲，故而趾尖也有些朝外，他雙手頗庸俗，並常微微</p>
<p>希特勒皮膚甚薄，稍帶黃色，面部自顎迄頰，望上去不甚勻稱。他的額角狹小而向後削。頭髮生得很好，細緻柔和，作深棕色。他的鬍子亦復如此。這是所謂「頭髮色的頭髮」。如果像最近所傳，希特勒的頭髮現作赭色，那末，在我看到他之後，一定經過藥水漂洗過的了。他的嘴是他外表上最難看的一處。望上去幾乎不見嘴脣，牙齒稍向內傾。</p>
<p>希特勒的眼睛最爲動人。一見之下，令人難以忘懷。他兩眼並不像崇拜他者所說的作淡藍色，實則是藍灰色。我和希特勒會晤的半小時中，和他相對坐在一張狹長桌子旁。我從未凝視着他的雙目。他的兩眼老是向遠遠的望着。如果與一個眼睛不朝着你看的人談話，那眞是一件非常爲難的事。希特勒的眼睛却備具着這種特質，就是他的眼睛雖不朝着你看，而你却被迫的要注視着他呢。他精神提起之後，講起話來好像身上附着鬼怪。他講話的時候，不像有什麼聽衆在他前面，他的對象似乎爲一班意像中的聽衆——或者就是他本人。他簡直自己聽了自己所講的話而出神了。講話之時，他整個面部變化倏忽；一陣陣的顏色會變幻出來。在平庸的變化之中，他顯現着一種叫人迷惑，而又卑躬屈節似的感覺。他並不是被自己祟着，不過乾脆的被祟着而已。</p>
<p>希特勒對於諸色人等的影響力量，倒頗有一記之價値。我知道有若干高才卓識之士，儘會「跟着他跑」。有些人則見了他就覺忸怩不安，更有一部份人却是嫌惡他。我本人對他就覺芒刺在背。我好像看到了一種不便公開的秘密展覽似的哩。但是他在大衆之前，其影響的不可思議，又屬無可諱言</p>
<p>我曾經聽過他好幾次的演說，結果總感覺冷酷，表示嫌惡，好像看到了什麼不甚佳妙的景象似的。而那些景像實在是不甚高明。他對羣衆演說時，總要做出一種貓咪動物所具的魔力。他不善詞令。在冷嘲熱駡，令人迷惘的語言方式上，希特勒決不是戈林的對手。就演講而論，當然維斯福可以常他的老師而無愧。希特勒的演說旣散漫，復迂迥，他所用的詞句往往意義不透切，不顧文法，又夾雜着奧地利北方的粗鄙語言。我不得不承認要不是爲了要聽取他的言論而耹他之言外，我眞感覺着討厭。就他本人而論，他並不欲取厭於人，因爲在精神恍惚之間所作神媒的談話，並不叫人討厭哩</p>
<p>在羣衆之中，希特勒成爲一個性情乖戾，想入非非，最感痛苦的一人，好像他們中間的一團黑影，造成誇大可怕，緊張而具有鬼怪似的空氣。人家對着他害怕，對着他所左右的羣衆也是驚恐。希特勒是殘忍的，但是對於動物及幼童，倒並不因此而失其憐愛之心。他睚眥必報，有若婦人一般。對人從不寬恕，也從不忘記仇惡。就是綫微之隙，過了幾年，他還是要報復——九三四年的淸黨運動即其一例。我疑惑希特勒是從來不會和人家發生正常關係的。</p>
<p>我不相信希特勒會傾向和平。這緣故並不與邏輯有關，除了作戰之外，他一切多不用邏輯。他執迷不悟，憑其虛玄，故弄狡獪的手段，洩忿排怒惟恐天下不亂。他簡直是無理可喩。我深信他如果一旦講起道理來，就要失去他的「天才」了。</p>

<p>自日本南進野心、益形露骨後、英美兩國即已有不惜以軍事行勳制止日本繼續侵略之決心、於是兩國重申撤很遠東僑民之勸吿、同時在新加坡關島設防、行動之積極、遂使日本張皇異常、一方故作鎮定之表示、一方復露求和之意、但英美注重行爲、不重空言、其態度之堅決、已有不可撼動之勢、日方苦悶之餘、乃發表嫁禍於英美之言論、此證之日軍發言人秋山之言論、信不誣也、</p>
<p>嚴以責人　絕不自省</p>
<p>爰日軍發言人秋山於咋日招待西報記者席上、竟譴責英美首先破壞太平洋現狀據稱、「取消英日同盟者爲英國、破瓖日美商的者爲美國、故日本常爲英美所犧牲、」該發言人以鴿子孵蛋爲喩、謂「鴿子係和平者、蛋則係一蛇耳、鴿子日本也、而英美在新加坡關島設防、並派澳大利軍隊源源赴馬來亞、此種行爲、非蛇而何、今日本有如被迫孵於蛇上」云云、繼稱、「太平洋兩岸、一岸在呼戰爭、美人也、另一岸高唱和平、此即爲在太平洋兩岸之日本、」發言人又提及汽車大王福特所言、「聽令英德兩國火併、」據稱「今羅斯福總統之外交政策、實富有此種思想」云、</p>
<p>全美意嚮　已趨一臻</p>
<p>英文大美晚報社論云、現在每過一日、即覺日本之呼號聲、减低一日、而美國之聲浪、增强一日、數星期前、日本充滿戰鬥性之呼聲、美國則守絨默、現下日本乃以未能爲他人諒解之和平使者自居、美國忽振起精神、發出一萬三千萬一心一意人民之呼聲、一月以前、日本報紙滿載攫取荷屬南洋、易如反掌、美國如敢攖其鋒、必將後悔莫及、而其發言人竟大聲疾呼、世上敢有遏阻日本之「不可動搖的政策」者、日本必將武力對付之、</p>
<p>美國態度　劍出於鞘</p>
<p>但美國忽劍出於鞘、令人不可這視、此際日本之戰鬥態度、突趨冷靜、在他人視之、或有認爲偶然之事者、吾人則殊以爲不然、從前東京之論調、無非以戰爭相威嚇、現皆一變而爲和平、從前美國取緘默態度、現在衆議院中討論關島設防案事、議塲中充滿堅決對日空氣、反對該案者僅議員一人·全世界人士，鑒於去年九月二十七日日本加入軸心國後之言論及行動、將無人實美以爲挑釁行動、美不過準備抵抗外界所加彼之侵略、日本亦不過得到自身所要求之事耳、</p>

<p>— 奈許</p>
<p>革新計劃</p>
<p>自一九二五年至一九三〇年之五年間，英美對新中國民族主義表現所作寬大之讓步，在公共租界之社會生活，經濟生活以及市政生活各方面，均已產生革命。例如外國舞廳中已有中國女子之影踪，此爲以前所從未夢想及者，且因中國女子體態美麗，反使外國女子相形見細，其他在各種重要事業方面，亦可獲見中國人較外人有後來居上之勢。靑年華人現已能直接與國外貿易，而不復依賴西人爲介紹。在市政生活中，中國人之興論，亦有驚人之組織、在一九二八年，市政機關中以前向爲外人所包辦者，從此亦有華人在內，但華人對於外人所許之讓步，猶嫌太緩，因此又有費唐革新計劃之產生，但華人仍，爲不足。其實中國當時唯能向英美要求並獲得其能力所應有之權利，甚至不平等之領事裁判權，亦可取消之。但當時所以未達到目的者，並非由外人之不妥協，實出於中國本身尙無能力與日本之阻碍而已。</p>
<p>漸進辦法</p>
<p>中國在政治復興之燦爛光輝時期內，要求其公共租界內中國有無限制之主權表現，而英美則根據費唐法官之調査，主張漸進之辦法，先由「過渡時代」着手，而後再談「交還租界」問題。日本則相反，主張立即取消租界，因之中國主權觀念與英法租界之存在問題，雙方所有之和解，爲之中斷。</p>

<p>中國在遠東之民族，與政治的發展，因日本之阻礙而陷於僵局，以致繼之者爲迅速之退化。此種情形，在上海公共租界亦正相同。一九三一年費唐革新計劃所貢獻之市政演進，因重大之政治事件而停頓，蓋一九三二年中日滬戰事件爆發，方過五年，至一九三七年又開始中日之全面戰爭，於是公共租界之兩大主角，即一方爲英美，另一方爲日本，不得不重定方針，藉以應付新局面。華軍在上海區作爲時雖短而英勇可敬之抗戰後，移師西撤，政治機關，亦隨之俱去，於是中外交涉之三角政治（即中國英美與日本），一變而爲英美與日本對峙之勢。至於本埠當地之「中國機關」，僅爲被動的角色而已。自一九三七年中日戰爭爆發以來，已入第四年期，上海公共租界所由維持之國際合作之基本傳統，已遭遇嚴重之挑戰，此次歐戰之　發，使此項挑戰，更形緊張。</p>
<p>需要合作</p>
<p>吾人於此若有一種敎訓可得，則此一敎訓，即爲在此時期內，如另有「民族主義」與「主權問題」等原動力伸入上海區域內，則本市即無安寗可言，而混亂之秩序與無政府狀態，將繼續流行。蓋在軍事米結束之前，英，美，日本及中國各自不同之政策，甚無融合之希望。在此極端之情形下，除非天降奇蹟，則全上海遲早將捲入混亂之游渦中。然則吾人蓋不使此種混戰愈遲愈佳，或有天降奇蹟之希望，亦未可知。無論如何，吾人身爲上海市民者，至少當盡一件義務，即吾人各自檢束，切勿爲遠東全面戰爭之起因，即使戰爭在所不免，亦勿以吾等各本國僑民之目標行爲或政策而招致之。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「現在已經是二十世紀了，爲甚麽還有這麽許多迷信的思想存在着呢？」時富有年靑的朋友這樣問。</p>
<p>這是一件不足爲怪的怪事。</p>
<p>在這個大世裏，存在着無數的小世界。每個人有每個人的小世界。他的環境，他的敎育，他的經騐，他的思想，他所看的書，他所接觸的人，他足跡所到之處，就是他的世界的範圍。</p>
<p>因此，在這二十世紀的社會上，有許多人還生活在中世紀的社會與思想的小世界中；在這表面繁華的上海，有許多飢餓凍餒的人；在這開明的科學化的世界中，也還有許多被幽禁在無知，愚妄，與迷信的陷阱中的可憐人。社會的眞相原來就是如此的。</p>
<p>談到破除迷信，就不禁令人想起一班血氣方剛的靑年所做的破壞偶像與搗毀廟堂的運動。他們的動機無疑地是純正的，可是他們的手段往往祇能引起對於新思想的更大的反感。我們的工作不是這樣簡單的。我們要用科學的開明的思想灌輸給他們，我們要從迷信的深井中把他們拯拔起來，使他們自己明白過去眼界的狹窄與思想的錯誤。</p>
<p>破除迷信是應該斬草除根的。甚麽是迷信之根呢？無知。無知是迷信之根！</p>

<h3 id="c102">肖羊的女人 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 山立</p>
<p>讀了前幾天自由談上那篇女人難做的，誰不爲那輩不幸的女人歎肩而表同情呢？但女人難做的地方，不止乎此。據我個人所知，女人一旦肖了羊，那麽她們的一生將比仟何女人更痛苦。</p>
<p>『女子肖羊，常帶七分苦塲；不敗夫家，定敗娘家。』這是一句流傳已久的無理的古話，可憐的肖羊的女人們，却就此被註定了她們的命運。假使她們生下後，家境大大變惡，那麽她們將不幸地被自己親生的父母目爲大敵人，而不被送至尼姑庵者幾希！一到及筓之年，她們就會處處遭到痛苦。有時當她和一個男子芷在幸福地過着戀愛生活時，假使忽然被他或他的父母發覺她是肖羊的，那麽他倆的愛情就會被一隻惡魔的巨手撕得粉碎。所以一個肖羊的靑年女子是很雞找到配偶的，即使找着了，大多是不會得到丈夫和公婆的寵幸的。</p>
<p>我有一個表哥，愛上了一個肖羊的女子，但他倆的愛情後來也被這句古話破壞了。據說他的父母還是基督敎徒呢！但這有什麽用？信敎是一件事，信古話又是一件事。在中國是不會覺得矛盾的。</p>
<p>我是一個肖羊的男子，據我父母說，他們在生我前二個月，早已決定，假使我一旦是女，那麽他們將毫無疑惑地立刻送我到尼姑庵裹去。幸而我不是一個女子。</p>
<p>我常常覺得奇怪，在現在這樣文明的社會裏，爲什麽仍有許多人會相信流傳已久而腐朽無理的古話呢？人們不是在進步着嗎？但爲什麽這種騙人的古話仍追隨着我們呢？我始終不懂，我奇怪。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>今日（二月廿二日）是美國國父華盛頓的生辰紀念日。美國的獨立，得力於華盛頓者甚多，因此華盛頓的治軍方法，也特別値得我們的注意。</p>
<p>華盛頓的軍中手册，曾在芝加哥公開展覽，引起許多鑑賞家的熱在。這冊子是華盛頓在一七七六年統率獨立軍時代所寫，其中包括若干手簽的命令，可窺見他治軍的一斑。</p>
<p>相傳美國獨立軍中流行一種罰咒的習慣，華盛頓深爲厭惡，故特簽署命令一道，訓誡各長官道：『咒詛和發誓，是愚笨和不正當的行爲。講一些褻凟神明的話，不過是粗惡和鄙陋的罪行。願長官們以身作則，勿使罰咒的惡習在軍中流行。』</p>
<p>華盛頓對於兵士的道德，也非常注重。手冊中曾記他爲士兵們私人菓園，偷採菓實，而予以譴責的訓令。</p>
<p>華盛頓的軍中手册，本已大部失散，只有一七七六年七八九諸月的，有一部份留在紐約城司令部，後被國際藝術組合公司收得。這次公開展覽的除手册外，還有華盛頓的量錢器，鈕扣，鞋扣，和一枚龜穀製成的鼻烟壺。</p>

<p>同時，才從破屋裏遷到金碧輝煌的新居中去的羅老太太，也在極度得意之餘，碰到了一些沒趣。</p>
<p>「喲！這是我們的新姑爺啊！爲什麽還不上那邊去呢？」她在一張軟榻上躺着，眼看那個照片上的人，很忙亂地在屋子裏前前後後的招呼，直到吉時已過，還不見他上舉行婚禮的所在去，便悄悄地向袁鎭守使從北京帶來的一個老媽子問。</p>
<p>「這是我們的七爺啊！老太太，是新貴人的大姪子。」一個出乎意外的答復。</p>
<p>「什麽…話？」半身不遂的羅老太太，幾乎就想從軟榻上跳起來。</p>
<p>「他是我們鎮守使的姪兒。」老媽子又重複了一句。</p>
<p>羅老太太掙大着一雙眸子，再也想不出有什慶話好說。恰好袁紹文又從鬥外走過。</p>
<p>「對…不…起…！」羅老太太用足了所有的力氣，向那個老媽子說：「請他進來…我…有話請…敎…他。…」</p>
<p>老媽子便立刻搶到門口邊去，高喊道：</p>
<p>「七爺，請你來一次，三姨奶奶的老太太，有話給你說咧！</p>
<p>然而待袁紹文跨進屋子羅老太太已說不出什麽話了　（三七）</p>

<p>— 寄谷</p>
<p>住在隔壁後樓的那個矮人的肚子一天天的高起來，像是一個快要脫蒂的熟瓜兒，但是她還是時常拖着她的大肚子蹲在自來水管邊掏米，洗菜，洗衣服；一邊洗，一邊嘴裏咕噥着，她四個女兒是「討債鬼」。</p>
<p>住在灶披間裹的胖女人走出來和她搭訕：</p>
<p>「老是這樣蹲着累嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎麽不累！都是爲了那幾個討債鬼…」</p>
<p>「好了過幾天我們可以吃紅蛋了！多送我幾個才好！」</p>
<p>「別要緊說，生下來才算數。」她嘴裏雖然是這樣說，但心裏也頗覺樂觀：「已經一連生了叫個女兒啦，這一回總該是個兒子了。要是再…」</p>
<p>矮女人七歲的女兒在鬥口玩，隔壁的婆婆問她：</p>
<p>「你媽生產了吧？生的是弟弟，還是妹妹？」</p>
<p>「又是一個妹妹，胖胖的很好玩，哭起來哇呀哇呀的怪響。可是媽說要丢掉她…」美然，蹲在她後面生煤球爐的姊姊過來把她使勁的推了一下。「誰說？媽是說把小妹妹送給人家去養，誰說丢掉她？」說着還想打她，嚇得她逃了。</p>
<p>晚上，前樓那個喜管閒事的獨眼姑娘，低聲地問着矮女人的大女兒：</p>
<p>「怎麽沒有哭聲，你們的小妹妹呢？」</p>
<p>「送給人家了。」</p>
<p>今天早上，弄堂裹垃圾箱邊發現了一個小屍體，一個胖胖的初生嬰孩的屍體。</p>

<p>Washington - The strengthening of American air power in the Pacific is the subject of much discussion today, reportedly due to General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, making a statement yesterday at the Senate Military Committee. According to reports, General Marshall told the committee that the Army Department would transfer some rapid descent bombers and other aircraft to the Navy, enabling the Navy Department's Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers to reach wartime strength. General Marshall argued that the situation in the Far East prompted this action and said, "The United States should be prepared to deal with any eventuality." He said that the number of aircraft transferred would be less than one hundred. It is reported that he did not mention the Philippine issue. He expressed optimism about the possibility of British victory and satisfaction with the progress of the U.S. defense program. (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - It was learned here yesterday that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall reported in a closed session of the Senate Military Committee that the United States and Britain are rushing to dispatch aircraft to strengthen the Pacific air defenses. As to where the U.S. aircraft will be sent, General Marshall refused to announce. It is widely believed that Singapore is the destination. Reports also suggest that some aircraft will be sent to defend Hong Kong, the most advanced British outpost in the Far East. It is asserted that the Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong (transliteration) is highly usable. After the closed session, it was reported that the plan is being given careful consideration through "full cooperation" between British and American military leaders. (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources said last night that a large batch of U.S. patrol bombers, ordered by the British from the United States, will be rushed across the Pacific to strengthen Singapore's air defenses. It is rumored that Australian pilots will secretly transport these forty-ton engine patrol bombers, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. The British Purchasing Commission declined to comment on this matter. (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - Today, the British Embassy announced that aircraft would fly from the west coast of the United States to the Far East, thus confirming the rumors that aircraft are crossing the Pacific to the Far East. The Embassy declined to release details. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Reliable sources report that Britain has proposed several methods to prevent Japan from stockpiling large quantities of materials to prepare for war against democratic countries. This plan has been delivered to Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal representative, for his consideration and is currently under review in the White House. Britain has specifically emphasized its unwillingness to provoke Japan. The outline is as follows: (1) The United States, the Philippines, the British Empire, and Allied colonies should strictly limit exports to Japan to the amount of peacetime needs or less. (2) The United States should impose an indirect restriction on Japanese imports, i.e., the American shipping available to Japan, especially oil tankers, must be reduced to peacetime levels or less. (3) The United States should purchase large quantities of important raw materials from South American countries, which would strike at Japanese purchasing in that region. (4) The United States should allow Britain to establish contraband inspection stations in the Caribbean Sea, which would allow Britain to further control important raw materials shipped from South America through the Panama Canal to the Far East. It is reported that the British government pointed out to Hopkins that the United States has already completely prohibited the shipment of a small number of items, such as aviation gasoline, to Japan, but various other oils and cotton, lead, minerals, etc., are not subject to the embargo. At the same time, Britain has restricted a very wide range of items to Japan, only allowing exports to the extent of Japan's peacetime needs. Therefore, Britain suggests that British policy should echo that of the United States, and that the United States and the Philippines should also limit exports to Japan to peacetime levels. The significance of this is that the United States would expand its export licensing system and extend it to the Philippines. It is also reported that the British government told Hopkins that if U.S. oil tankers and U.S.-controlled oil tankers, such as Panamanian ships, ceased oil shipments to Japan, Japan's import capacity would be greatly reduced.

<p>Dutch East Indies Strengthens Defenses, Prepares for Scorched-Earth Warfare</p>
<p>Manila - The Dutch East Indies is today closely watching Japanese activities in southern French Indochina, believing that Japan's establishment of naval and air bases near Saigon is a sufficient threat to the security of the Dutch East Indies, as it is very convenient to attack the rich oil well region of Borneo from Saigon. Authorities have taken various measures that, should the enemy land, the authorities will destroy the oil wells in the area, turning what the enemy gains into a desolate forest. There are currently twelve American instructors in the Soerabaja area teaching the Dutch how to operate new seaplanes. The authorities have also increased taxes to strengthen the war machine. Companies in Java must pay a tax of 40%, while the people pay 25%. The Dutch still hope that the U.S. Navy will assist in the defense of the islands should the enemy invade, but officials solemnly declare that they do not completely rely on outside forces. In fact, foreign aid is not included in the authorities' defense plans. Every able-bodied man in the area is assigned to a military unit for several hours of training each week, and some faint under the hot sun. The Batavia government is also trying to purchase American military equipment to bolster its defenses. As for negotiations with Japan, both sides are currently waiting for the right moment. The previous exchange was merely an exchange of memorandums, and both sides are waiting for the other to take new action. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan's Nerve War Against Britain and the United States: Soviet Newspaper Exposes Its Weaknesses <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Red Star newspaper commented on the weaknesses of Japan's nerve war against Britain and the United States, and compared Japan's military preparations with its southern advance plans. It stated that the vulnerability in these preparations has recently been pointed out by Mr. Hirao, Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. Mr. Hirao published a warning, explaining the extent to which Japanese war equipment depends on overseas supplies. From Hirao's article, it can be seen that the purpose of the statements made by Japanese diplomats in their special nerve war against Britain and the United States is solely to compare these statements with the reported activities of Japanese militarists. Foreign observers feel that the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the military are acting independently of each other. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Britain Concentrates Forces to Defend Far East Fortress</p>
<p>New York - International News Service reporter Kipling recently made the following statement: "I recently learned the secret of Singapore, and know that Britain will resolutely use its remaining strength from the European war to fully defend Singapore. I also know that British officials attach great importance to the security of the area. If the British had to choose between losing Singapore and Gibraltar, the British would rather give up Gibraltar. I have had the opportunity to learn about the defense projects of this British Far East fortress. This defense has recently been greatly strengthened by the arrival of Australian troops. From what I have seen, it is sufficient to prove that the British will concentrate their forces in one area, guarding the key area of Singapore to deal with all eventualities." (International News Service, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - Naval military experts here said yesterday that Japan may be able to capture Singapore, but the cost would outweigh the benefits. Navy personnel said that any Japanese attempt to seize the British naval base in the Far East, even if there were no British ships nearby, would cost the Japanese a great price. Even if Japan were to succeed in its attempt to occupy it, it would be unable to develop it. However, experts believe that if Britain does not send a powerful navy to protect Singapore, the Japanese navy would have the ability to blockade the island. For the Japanese, the best strategy would be to plunge the island into famine and force it to surrender. If the Japanese are willing to pay a heavy price, they can also capture it by force. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Manila - Yesterday, another 500 American soldiers arrived here on the "Grant," followed by 142 American officers arriving in the Philippines. It has not been disclosed whether they are here for troop rotation or reinforcement. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Rumor of Japanese Ultimatum to Thailand and Vietnam, Southern Advance Becomes More Blatant</p>
<p>London - The London "Daily Express" reported yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has issued "ultimatums" to French Indochina and Thailand, demanding "unrestricted facilities" for Japanese land, sea, and air forces in Thai and Vietnamese territory. According to the "Daily Express," these demands were made after a special meeting of the Japanese wartime cabinet. The newspaper said that Tokyo claims that Britain's reinforcement of Singapore and the Malay Peninsula is intended to prepare for an attack on Thailand. This statement from Tokyo is adopting the style of Hitler before his aggression. (News from Tokyo states that a government spokesman believes that the landing of Australian troops in Singapore is "another proof" that the British know the Far East situation is very critical. Also, according to the London Daily Express, more than half of the Japanese air force on the Asian continent has been concentrated on Hainan Island, Vietnam, and Guangdong Province. Japanese landing troops are also moving south, preparing to take action in Vietnam and Thailand. (International News Service, 20th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai Foreign Ministry has denied rumors that Japan has requested various military facilities from Thailand. Authoritative sources said that Thailand will reject any request of a military nature from any party. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>New York - Dow Jones News Service received a telegram from Shanghai stating that, according to confirmed news, Japanese troops are being transported from Taiwan and mainland Japan to the south, either to Hainan or northern Vietnam. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Bangkok - Reliable sources report that Japan will station fifteen Japanese warships near the French naval port of Kompong Som in Thailand and Vietnam during the armistice negotiations, which is half of the Japanese South Seas Fleet. The other half is patrolling offshore Saigon. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A Japanese dispatch from Bangkok states that French Vietnamese troops bombarded Thai troops near the Salankiel and Sophie areas on the eastern border of Vietnam yesterday morning. Japanese sources said that the French forces were encouraged to attack the Thai army after receiving aircraft from Britain, thus violating the French-Thai armistice conditions.

<h3 id="e3">National Grain Management <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The idea of establishing a central government agency to manage the nation's grain supply, overseeing production, consumption, and adjusting surpluses and deficits, has been around for more than a decade. However, due to constant changes and discrepancies in the designation of positions, responsibilities, and powers, a formal system has never been established. With the invasion of foreign enemies and the displacement of the population, the demand for food has concentrated in areas with backward agriculture, and prices have soared due to the imbalance between supply and demand. As a result, the National Grain Administration was established, first at the central level and then in various provinces, with some success. Recently, a National Grain Conference was convened, which opened in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, marking a significant and crucial initiative. Food is a matter of great importance to the people and the foundation of governance. After thousands of years of laissez-faire policies, and during this protracted period of resistance and national reconstruction, the challenges and difficulties are unprecedented. How can we expect that establishing an administration and holding a conference will easily solve all the problems? Therefore, the nation should not have overly high expectations for this conference. The goal is for the conference to develop a sound plan, and for farmers, traders, distributors, and consumers to sincerely cooperate with the government, so that tangible results can be seen.</p>
<p>The government's main objective in managing grain is to ensure that the entire population has enough to eat. The necessary conditions for management are to avoid harming farmers and businesses while ensuring that grain prices are reasonable. If the focus is solely on the convenience of consumers and only on lowering grain prices, then both farmers and businesses will suffer. If the focus is solely on the interests of producers and traders, allowing them to manipulate and hoard, then the people's food supply will be severely affected. Since the situation is conflicting and contradictory, both sides must be taken into consideration, and the key is to address their opposition and promote their cooperation. We must ensure that farmers benefit from farming and enjoy farming, that traders benefit from trading and enjoy trading, and that consumers do not struggle to get enough to eat. The principle is simple: fairness and accuracy. Fairness means that the scale is balanced and there is no bias, and accuracy means that the line is straight and there is no deviation. However, it is easier said than done. Grain management, from production to transportation to storage, requires step-by-step management and comprehensive management. The complexity and difficulty are almost indescribable. However, this is only one aspect of management. The population is usually static, but in the extraordinary period of resistance and national reconstruction, it is rapidly changing. Grain follows the population, so those who manage it cannot simply close their doors and come up with solutions, nor can they expect that an unchanging method will be sufficient to adapt to change. The difficulty is unimaginable. However, this is only one aspect of management. If we can fully understand the abundance or scarcity of production, the distance and accessibility of transportation, the careful planning of storage, and the dynamic changes in the population in different regions, we must also separately review general living conditions and, based on the conditions of minimizing harm to farmers, businesses, and the people, formulate reasonable prices and carefully prevent all possible abuses related to distribution in the buying and selling system. This is another extremely important aspect of grain management. Therefore, it is said that it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Let's not even talk about the ideal modern management system. The fundamental problem of China's current food supply is the lack of production. This is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that we must import rice every year. However, since the country has never had a management system in place, can we be sure that there is absolutely no hoarding of grain in various regions? Therefore, the total amount of imports each year may not necessarily be the difference between the nation's annual production and consumption. How much must be imported each year, and how must it be imported to reduce the damage to the national economy? This is one of the management's objectives. Throughout history, local governments, chambers of commerce, and other public organizations have often governed grain in their respective regions, acting impulsively, prioritizing small personal gains, and acting blindly. This is not what is meant by grain management. Because their perspective is limited to one area, they seem to believe that a shortage will immediately lead to widespread starvation and unanswered calls for help. This is understandable, but the fact that calls for help go unanswered is precisely because the nation's grain supply has not been managed. If there is no shortage, and they strive to have a surplus, believing that this is a sign of wealth and stability for the area, they block its outflow and suppress prices, claiming to be benefiting the people's livelihood, they do not realize that low grain prices harm farmers and are a major cause of rural bankruptcy, and they do not realize that withholding their surplus without using it to supplement the shortages in other areas is unethical and uneconomical. How can we eliminate this type of feudalistic behavior? How can we break down narrow-mindedness about regional self-interest? This is another management objective. Today's food situation is simply described as famine and high prices, which seems to make it impossible to talk about storage. However, in a broad sense, storage is not just about building granaries and preparing for famine. The reality of the grain market and the seasonal weighing of the crop are related to storage. Whenever there is a so-called grain problem, the market is chaotic, people are panicked, and profiteers take advantage of the situation to make huge profits. Then, there are measures such as selling grain at a flat price and setting price limits, which seem to be effective ways to provide relief and manage the situation. However, what is the actual effect? There are many doubts. Furthermore, there are those who use hypocrisy to cover up their great evils and those who manipulate the law to seek their own interests. Their crimes are unforgivable and their deceit is difficult to eliminate. However, if we ask the simple question: how much storage does the market actually have? The answer is often extremely difficult to obtain in the midst of panic. As a result, it is impossible for outsiders to know whether the panic is justified. How can this phenomenon be remedied? Thus, investigating storage is a prerequisite for storage and the initial step in management. This is yet another management objective. Grain management is a major national issue. Can this conference bring some order to this chaotic situation?</p>
<h3 id="e4">Soviet-Japanese Economic Cooperation Agreement Reached in Principle, Reportedly Signed in Moscow <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Singapore - According to a Saigon radio broadcast tonight, the Soviet Union and Japan have signed an economic cooperation agreement in principle in Moscow. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - An article in the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that as trade talks between Japan and the Soviet Union are about to begin, attention should be paid to the political relationship of economic cooperation between the two countries. The resumption of trade negotiations is enough to show that the two countries are willing to maintain friendly relations. It is hoped that the success of the negotiations will contribute to the establishment of general peace and order in the Far East. The results of Japanese-Soviet cooperation can be relied upon by the geographical conditions of the Soviet Union, and will make the Axis powers more closely connected. The negotiation can be optimistic, for the following reasons: (1) The spread of the European War and the development of the overall situation in the Far East not only make the mutual suspicion between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East meaningless, but also create economic and political reasons to make economic cooperation between the two countries beneficial. (2) The war has caused the Soviet Union to turn to Japan, and then to other countries in East Asia, to obtain the supply of machinery, ships, rubber, and non-ferrous metals. (3) Japan is forced to abandon its reliance on the United Kingdom and the United States due to the unwarranted economic pressure imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and now needs the assistance of the Soviet Union.

Foreign Minister Wang added that the various claims made by the Japanese side are unfounded. He stated that the Soviet government believes that the relationship between the Chinese government and the Communist Party is purely a domestic matter. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet Union's attitude on this point has been very clear. The claims made by the Japanese side are of course based on speculation about the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, but China has made detailed explanations to Moscow and other governments about this matter. When asked by reporters whether there was a phenomenon of reduced Soviet aid, Foreign Minister Wang replied that he believed that the various items transported to China via Turkestan were still being transported in sufficient quantities. As for the quantity of goods transported, only military authorities know the specifics. When discussing Japanese-Soviet negotiations, Foreign Minister Wang said that the Japanese side hopes to conclude a fisheries and commerce treaty with the Soviet Union, as well as a non-aggression treaty, but there has been little progress in the former two negotiations. In the near future, it seems unlikely that a non-aggression treaty will be concluded, as the Soviet Union clearly wants to maintain its current inherent advantages. (United Press, 21st)</p>

<p>Hong Kong - According to travelers from Guangzhou, house-to-house searches are conducted at any time, and pedestrians are checked at every street corner. Several guerrilla bases have been uncovered in the western suburbs of Guangzhou. Bombings have occurred five times, the last time near the Xinhua Theater in the city center, killing several Japanese soldiers. Since the repeated bombings, commerce in Guangzhou, including that run by the Japanese, has declined sharply. Searches were intensified on Chinese New Year's Eve, and more than 200 Chinese were arrested on suspicion of being terrorists. Military police sometimes search civilian homes between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM to see if residents are all at home. Although commerce in Guangzhou is not developed, goods are still transported from Whampoa. The development plan for Whampoa has actually been completed. Large Japanese cargo ships sail to Whampoa to unload goods, which are then transferred to Guangzhou by rail. This railway was originally built by the Chinese, but has now been completed by the Japanese. Another route runs from Zhongshan to Shiqi, and then by highway to Macau. There are more than 100 Japanese aircraft in Guangzhou. On one occasion, 30 took off and circled over Guangzhou. (International Telegram, 21st)</p>

It is Rumored that Britain is Determined to Take Offensive Action in the Balkans. <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Cairo - British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill arrived in Cairo yesterday. A spokesman for the British Embassy told a Reuters reporter that after the glorious victory of the British Army stationed in the Nile River, the time for a comprehensive review of the political and military situation in the Middle East and Africa has matured. The War Cabinet dispatched the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff as its military advisor, which demonstrates the importance it attaches to this review. The two gentlemen will hold detailed discussions with Middle East military leaders and other authorities. It is very beneficial to the War Cabinet to have one of its members obtain direct intelligence regarding the Middle Eastern battlefield. Eden, who previously served as Secretary of War, once toured the Middle East and is familiar with the issues and figures in this part of the world. Therefore, it is only natural that the Cabinet chose Eden to undertake this mission. It is reported that Eden and General Dill left London a few days ago and flew to Egypt. This is Eden's third visit to Egypt since the start of the war. A year ago, when Eden was Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, he came to Egypt to welcome the first batch of Dominion troops. These troops participated in the Libyan campaign and achieved successive victories. Last November, when Eden was Secretary of War, he came to Egypt again to discuss everything with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, and to inspect the war situation in North Africa and East Africa. Therefore, he is particularly familiar with the military and political issues concerning the Middle East, which is unmatched by any young politician. It is rumored that Eden may take some time to visit the Italian territories recently occupied by the British army. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Rebellion in Abyssinia, Difficult for Italy to Cope</p>
<p>Khartoum - A Reuters special correspondent stationed on the Abyssinian-Eritrean border stated that the newly formed Abyssinian regular army, led by South African officers, will first participate in the attack on the Italian army's positions in Ganjela. Colonel Deliri, commander of the Italian army in the Gojjam region, once made a boast, saying that he would quell the rebellion of patriotic elements in Abyssinia and eradicate the British delegation remaining in Abyssinia. However, as a result, the chaos in the area has become unmanageable. Deliri has already been forced to retreat. When a large detachment of Abyssinian regular army, patriotic elements disguised as civilians, and Sudanese border guards began to attack, half of the Italian garrison had already withdrawn. Before the land attack began, the British Air Force bombed the Italian army barracks, destroying barbed wire and other defenses, so that the Abyssinian army could quickly reach its destination. Before the regular army entered the battlefield, the Abyssinian King held a ceremonial review. Junior officers and soldiers all swore allegiance, and the Abyssinian King presented flags.

<p>New York - For the past few days, national newspapers have placed the Balkan situation in a prominent position, but now it has been replaced by the situation in Japan and the Far East. However, the opinions of various newspapers and wireless transmissions have not yet shown any signs of attaching great importance to the Japanese threat. It seems that they all regard it as a kind of psychological warfare. If Japan really has this intention, then as far as the United States is concerned, it can be said to have failed, because the firmness of the United States and Britain in dealing with the situation has made general commentators somewhat optimistic about the current situation, and they believe that Japan will soften its stance. However, it is also acknowledged that the development may lead to a critical situation. The newspapers have expressed a more hopeful attitude towards the Balkan situation, believing that the arrival of British Secretary of War Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill in Cairo is clear evidence of Britain's determination to take offensive military action in the Balkans. It is now believed that Greece will continue to resist, and British aid will not be interrupted. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Yesterday, the Greek diplomatic office here strongly denied any peace negotiations with Italy. They said, "No matter what, we cannot abandon Britain." However, it is rumored that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, is still constantly requesting the Turkish government to mediate the Greek-Italian war. According to sources from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bulgaria will abandon the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration in order to allow Germany to use Bulgaria as a base for invading Greece. Also, according to British sources, if [Germany] attacks Greece, Turkey will immediately declare war on Germany, but will take a defensive stance strategically, which is most suitable for Turkey and can allow British warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait to attack Romanian transport lines. At the same time, the British army can also use Turkey as a base of operations. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

At the same time, it is claimed that Bulgaria has mobilized some reserve forces and has taken precautionary measures. According to diplomatic circles in the capital of South [Yugoslavia], the final demands made by Germany to Greece regarding the Italian-Greek armistice will be presented in the next two days. The Turkish Vakit newspaper claimed this morning that although the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement has been signed, Turkey will not be able to maintain neutrality if foreign troops enter Bulgaria. Therefore, the Balkan situation is tense again today. Furthermore, according to diplomatic sources, if Greece does not accept Germany's mediation proposal, the date for German troops to advance to Thessaloniki, Greece, has been set for next Tuesday.

<p>Sofia - The tension here continues to increase today. Well-informed sources insist that German troops have built a pontoon bridge on the Danube River, and there is also clear evidence that part of the Bulgarian army has been mobilized. Although the government has formally denied that a pontoon bridge has been built on the Danube River near Raschuk on the Bulgarian border, news of the construction of this pontoon bridge continues to arrive here. A government spokesperson also admitted that there were such rumors but said that they were not true. A certain bulletin openly declared, "It is a public fact that reservists have been called into the army to defend the country." Another rumor is that Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and Germany are currently negotiating a mutual assistance pact, but this news cannot be verified in any way. Some believe that the Soviet Union will protect Bulgaria, but others openly admit that there is no way to prevent German troops from passing through Bulgaria. The general Bulgarian public has expressed unease due to the mobilization movement, the receipt of bread shops, and rumors of Germany building a pontoon bridge on the Danube River.

<p>London - Ankara Radio announced yesterday that the Turkish newspaper Akşam commented on the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration, saying that Turkey takes the British-Turkish alliance as its eternal national policy. If outsiders think that Turkey can take actions contrary to its alliance with Britain, they are greatly mistaken. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Istanbul - The Turkish newspaper Vakit refuted the Bulgarian government's claim that according to the agreement with Turkey, it can allow German troops to pass through, saying, "Now someone thinks that the signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration means that Bulgaria has obtained Turkey's neutrality and can allow German troops to pass through. Turkey can resolutely tell them no. Bulgaria's signing of this declaration has given unreserved recognition to the friendship and alliance between Britain and Turkey and between Turkey and Greece. The evidence is there and cannot be disputed." Turkish Congressman Yarçin revealed in an article in the Yeni Sabah newspaper that the British-Turkish alliance is unchangeable. The psychological warfare waged by the Axis powers in the Balkans will eventually collapse before the fortress of Turkish strength. The constant contact between Britain and Turkey during the difficult period has created a deep-rooted friendship and mutual respect and trust between the two countries. The Turkish people today are still acting in the same way as Britain in the past, and are always close friends and allies with the same interests who share joys and sorrows.

<h3 id="e15">Germany Will Launch a Submarine Offensive <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin - Last night, the highest authorities of the German government revealed to reporters that the plan for a large-scale submarine offensive against Britain in the spring is to force Britain to either "surrender or perish." It is said that dozens of German submarines will search around the British Isles, seize and sink any ships they see. Their only goal is the surrender of Britain. The British will not be able to continue fighting, because the merchant fleet, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, has been greatly damaged by the continuous and fierce attacks of submarines. It is pointed out that the last war was almost won by German submarines. This fact has not only been recognized by neutral historians but also by British historians. Today, the Third Reich's submarine warfare is far more perfect than what was dreamed of in 1917. Although the German goals in the spring have been clearly stated, people still expect other surprising actions to occur on the battlefield. This is because the Führer Hitler will, as in the past, deliberately conceal his every action. What the German government has revealed may be just another military operation. Observers here say that the only thing that can be determined is that a powerful German submarine fleet will soon surround Britain. It is revealed that these new submarines can travel 60 miles per hour and launch torpedoes very quickly and accurately. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>

The income of collective farms and individual collective farmers has increased. Investments used to establish new enterprises reached nearly 38,000,000,000 rubles in 1940, and 108,000,000,000 rubles in the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan.

As long as there are Australians on the ground, they will never let Britain fail. Menzies mentioned his tour of the Middle East and said that he flew 3,500 miles in the Middle East, from Jerusalem to Benghazi. This distance also shows how rapid the Australian army's actions are. He saw that the morale of the Australian army was high. They regarded the war against Italy as a slow preliminary action. What they hoped for was to fight against the German army. Menzies also praised the British people for enduring the bombing and said that he brought with him from Australia the belief that victory is certain, and the definite guarantee that as long as Australia has a shred of strength, it will never let Britain fight alone. He hoped to personally witness the current situation in Britain, so that when he returned to Australia, he could give Australians a clear impression of the real situation in Britain. He is convinced that the clearer Australians understand the truth, the greater Australia's war efforts will be. Britain will undoubtedly win, but it cannot achieve complete victory without exerting its greatest efforts. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Yesterday evening, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka denied the reports from London that he had suggested mediation to British Foreign Secretary Eden.

<p>Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign visitors today that reports of Foreign Minister Matsuoka making mediation suggestions to a certain country were untrue. Matsuoka's communication to British Foreign Secretary Eden expressed his personal views on the Far Eastern crisis and the construction of a new world order. Matsuoka's communication was delivered to Eden by the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, because Eden had previously expressed his views on Japan's mediation of the Thai-Indochina dispute and the overall situation in the Far East to the Japanese ambassador. Therefore, he took the opportunity to state his personal views to Eden. Matsuoka's communication should not be regarded as an offer of mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

When asked about statements by U.S. congressmen that if Japan attacked Singapore, the United States would attack Japan, Ishii retorted, "Who can predict that Japan will attack Singapore?"

<p>Practicing Cunning Tricks; Japan's Plans Will Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>Bombay - Indian newspapers believe that Japan's mediation efforts are merely a diplomatic move to divert attention from Japan's contradictory behavior. The "Bombay Sentinel" stated that Britain does not need Japan's mediation, and Britain is stepping up preparations in the Far East, while Japan's attitude is becoming more friendly. "Sind Observer" stated that a country that has been at war with China for a decade is now suggesting it is willing to work for peace, which is hypocritical. It is difficult for the world to believe that Japan's move stems from genuine hopes for peace, because if Japan has such sincerity, it must set a precedent and end its aggressive actions against China. "Free Press Journal" stated that while Hitler is currently conducting a war of nerves against the enemy, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is conducting a war of cleverness. The former's actions are ferocious and terrifying, while the latter's actions are cunning and treacherous. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Motives for Japan's Actions: Observations from Chongqing</p>
<p>Chongqing - Until now, the general public has not paid much attention to the Japanese proposal to mediate the European war. It was not until the British revealed it in the House of Commons that people were surprised. Observers commented on the motives behind this unexpected move by Japan, believing that there must be several reasons: first, Germany's repeated proposals for peace have failed, so this decision was changed to have Japan come forward; if it succeeds, the Sino-Japanese war may also be resolved at the same time; second, the U.S. Senate is currently discussing the Lend-Lease Act, and Japan wants to influence it with this move; third, knowing that this kind of mediation is difficult to accept, but before Germany launches an offensive against mainland Britain and Japan echoes it in the Far East, they want to place the responsibility for the war on Britain and the United States. In short, Japan has already concluded an alliance with the Axis powers, and it seems that it had consulted the opinions of these countries before suggesting mediation. However, it still made this suggestion at this time, not caring about temporary failure, which is something that most people cannot understand. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome Expresses: Determined to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - Regarding the Japanese proposal to mediate the current European war, the Roman newspapers all refused to express any opinions. Italian political figures want to wait until Japan publishes the content of the mediation before expressing their opinions, saying only that the meaning of Japan's move is not as great as the foreign newspapers have reported. They speculate that its intention is to counter the strategy of Britain and the Australian Federation jointly spreading alarming news in the Pacific region, prompting the United States to take a stronger attitude towards Japan, because Japan can take the opportunity to propose mediating the current European war to reiterate its desire for peace. However, as far as Italy is concerned, it has firmly decided not to lay down its arms until the Axis powers achieve complete victory. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - After Britain and the United States adopted a tough stance in the Pacific, what actions Japan will take to deal with it is still being closely watched by all circles in China. Some say that Japan must wait until Germany's blitzkrieg in Europe resumes before deciding whether to launch an attack in the Pacific. Others say that if Japan's southward advance is blocked, it will turn its attention to China. Chinese circles believe that if Japan launches a war in the South Pacific, its main force will attack Singapore by land, and its navy will attack the Dutch East Indies. However, the Japanese army and navy concentrated in the South China Sea are not yet sufficient to launch an immediate attack. It is rumored that Japanese troops have been arriving in Hankou for days, but the number of newly arrived Japanese troops is not large, and it is not known whether they are reinforcements or replacements. Well-informed Chinese sources say that Germany is currently trying to reach a compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, so it is urging Japan to return South Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union as a reward for concluding a non-aggression pact. It is heard that Moscow is now advocating that Japan should withdraw its fleet stationed in the North Pacific to eliminate the threat to Vladivostok. There are currently 200,000 Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo," while there are as many as 600,000 Soviet troops on the border of "Manchukuo." (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) The third is to promote thrift and savings. Thrift is the prerequisite for integrity and should be implemented in clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all aspects of daily life. At this time of war, how can everyone forget the bloody battles of the soldiers at the front and not know how to strengthen hardship? The closer we get to victory, the more arduous the resistance and construction work will inevitably be, and the sources of military supplies and people's livelihood will inevitably be more difficult. For public and private reasons, we should not only be thrifty but also strive to save. We must eradicate old habits, maintain our lives, relieve our compatriots, and revive our country, so we must be thrifty. It must be known that thrift can make the most of things and make the family not poor.</p>
<p>Only when the country has surplus wealth can it meet the moral standards of wartime. The meaning of savings should also be extended. Not only should we save money, but we should also cherish things. In modern civilized countries, children's education mostly regards collecting waste as a patriotic virtue and using waste as a common sense of patriotism. Whether it is scrap copper, rotten iron, accumulated and used well, it can improve machinery. Even rags, scraps of paper, every grass, and every tree are all useful raw materials. We must not only cherish public property but also encourage our compatriots to collect waste and guide our compatriots to use waste. This is a broader sense of thrift and savings. It must be known that only by vigorously implementing thrift and savings can we cultivate a simple style. In this way, we can directly</p>
<p>Cure the roots of our nation's diseases of "extravagance" and "greed," and indirectly eliminate the bad customs of "theft" and "prostitution," and create a style of integrity and shame. Fourth is to promote health and sports. In general, people see the decline of our country in the past 100 years and the aggression of the Japanese against our country in the past 40 years, and they believe that we Chinese are a weak nation, believing that weakness is an inherent disease of our nation. I will never admit that our Chinese nation is a weak nation, but what I worry and shame about is only the weakness of the physique of our individual citizens. Generally speaking, it is only weak in physique, but in spirit, everyone sees many examples in our country's history of men dying for righteousness and women sacrificing themselves for the country. Even in this war, there are even more facts of generosity and martyrdom. For example, the recent martyrdom of Jin Huating, the editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao, is a heroic fact. For more than three years, our compatriots from all over the country, regardless of</p>
<p>Men, women, old and young, only rely on our patriotic enthusiasm and flesh and blood, can not avoid hardships and dangers, in the bombing, burning, shelling, bayonets, fire, and blood everywhere, year after year, day and night, continuous, very tragic life, swear to the death to resist and fight, but also can calmly and firmly as usual work. This kind of knife-saw punishment that is as sweet as sugar, moving the heavens and weeping ghosts, is enough to prove that our Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, has the most loyal, most tenacious kind of national character in the world. Where is it weak? Where is it cowardly? If the physique of our compatriots across the country can be stronger and more solid, then our nation will inevitably exert its more intense and courageous spirit. It goes without saying that it is a pity that today's general public has those who are sick without working and those who are still young and prematurely old. The "disease" and "weakness" of each citizen is indeed the most regrettable shame of our nation. Tracing its reasons, mostly due to</p>
<p>Not knowing hygiene and not valuing sports, the New Life Movement originally took hygiene as an important principle in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The popularization of national sports has been one of the important tasks over the years. In the future, not only should schools at all levels pay special attention to sports, but also all agencies, shops, factories, and rural areas, regardless of old or young, male or female, from private to public places, should popularize the habit of hygiene and cleanliness. Moreover, every compatriot should know that he must have a suitable fitness exercise to improve his personal physique and promote the health of the nation. Only in this way can we wash away the shame of the titles of "Sick Man of East Asia" and "Old China," and create a prosperous, strong, and happy modern country. Moreover, only by improving the national physique can we cure the roots of our nation's diseases of "laziness" and "cowardice," cultivate our spirit of cleanliness, speed, and accuracy, and establish a style of etiquette, justice, and shame in the country and society.

<h3 id="e40">International Anecdotes (6): Impressions of the Four Giants of Europe and America <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Dorothy Thompson, a renowned American writer, has been stationed in Europe for many years, serving as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. Due to the nature of her work, she frequently interacts with prominent figures in various countries' governments and societies. With her keen observations, she produces light and fluent reportage literature. Her writings are widely circulated and admired, making her an outstanding figure among female journalists. This article is a silhouette of the four giants of the current European and American stage—Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, and Roosevelt—penned by Ms. Thompson. It is insightful and poignant, and I have translated it as follows:</p>
<p>The most important figures in the world are Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin. What kind of people are they really? My knowledge of them, in the case of three, comes from my personal experience. I have never met Stalin. But I have met and talked with Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler. Perhaps the impressions I have gained can add something to the existing writings about them. Moreover, I have a very well-informed friend who has had close interactions with Stalin, so perhaps I can also contribute something to understanding the misunderstood personality of Stalin.</p>
<p>Churchill is a man of brightness and warmth, most aligned with the Doctrine of the Mean. Although he comes from Irish and American blood (Churchill's mother was American), he is thoroughly English. In every aspect, Churchill and Hitler are at opposite ends. Hitler came from humble beginnings; Churchill, on the other hand, is an "aristocrat of the royal family" of England. Hitler had a very difficult youth. Churchill, on the other hand, lived a life of luxury and ease from a young age.</p>
<p>Churchill is a bohemian aristocrat. Because of his extraordinary talent, unconventionality, and freedom from class consciousness. He is unmoved by fame and fortune; what he always keeps in mind is civilization. What distinguishes him from ordinary aristocrats is that he has no timidity towards the general public. If things get to a desperate point, he would rather see England become communist than be enslaved.</p>
<p>Churchill is a man under the Sagittarius constellation. Benevolent, chivalrous, and wholeheartedly devoted to his country, he can be said to be unprecedented. He took on a heavy responsibility during the most dangerous stage in British history, knowing it was impossible to succeed but doing it anyway, and he is still striving to do so. I don't believe that for a minute did he ever think that England would be defeated. If he had thought so, then England would have been utterly defeated after the collapse of France last June. But he never shirked his responsibilities. He trusts in the infinite human resources of England; he trusts in the English character, which cannot be measured by ordinary logic; he trusts in England, to which he entrusts his utter sincerity. Churchill possesses a spirit that transcends time, like his uniquely styled prose and speeches, which resemble ancient texts from hundreds of years ago. No one is as good as Churchill at evoking the great spirit of his ancestors—Shakespeare, Shelley, Nelson, Drake—to inspire popular morale and patriotic fervor.</p>
<p>Hitler, on the other hand, has a great appeal to the general public, which is his special talent. Where this power to influence others comes from is extremely difficult to understand. This power is like hypnosis, or more appropriately, it can be called magic. He has the power to drive the masses, allowing a vast multitude to follow him as if possessed. For example, many German women believe he is a handsome man.</p>
<p>I met with Hitler for half an hour. During these thirty minutes, I carefully examined him, hoping to gain a deep and unforgettable impression. He is five feet ten inches tall, but because his body is not very well proportioned, he always looks shorter. His upper body is longer than his lower body. His chest is slightly collapsed, and his shoulders are slightly rounded. He has a bad posture when standing, with a protruding abdomen and slightly bent legs, so his toes also point outward slightly. His hands are quite vulgar and often tremble slightly.</p>
<p>Hitler's skin is very thin, slightly yellowish, and his face, from his jaw to his cheeks, does not look very symmetrical. His forehead is narrow and recedes backward. His hair grows very well, fine and soft, and dark brown. His beard is also like this. This is what is called "hair-colored hair." If, as recently reported, Hitler's hair is now reddish-brown, then it must have been bleached after I saw him. His mouth is the ugliest part of his appearance. His lips are almost invisible, and his teeth tilt slightly inward.</p>
<p>Hitler's eyes are the most moving. At first sight, they are unforgettable. His eyes are not light blue, as those who worship him say, but rather blue-gray. During the half hour I met with Hitler, I sat opposite him at a long, narrow table. I never stared into his eyes. His eyes were always looking far away. It is very difficult to talk to someone whose eyes are not looking at you. Hitler's eyes, however, possess this quality: even though his eyes are not looking at you, you are forced to look at him. After his spirit is aroused, he speaks as if possessed by a ghost. When he speaks, it is as if there is no audience in front of him. His target seems to be an imaginary audience—or perhaps himself. He is simply entranced by hearing himself speak. When he speaks, his entire face changes abruptly; waves of color will change. In the midst of ordinary changes, he exhibits a confusing and obsequious feeling. He is not worshipped by himself, but simply worshipped.</p>
<p>Hitler's influence on all sorts of people is quite worth recording. I know that several highly talented and insightful people will "follow him." Some people feel uneasy when they see him, and some people detest him. I myself feel uncomfortable about him. I seem to have seen an exhibition of secrets that are not suitable for public display. But his influence on the masses is undeniably miraculous.</p>
<p>I have heard him speak several times, and the result is always a feeling of coldness and aversion, as if I have seen something not very wonderful. And those scenes are indeed not very clever. When he speaks to the masses, he always produces a kind of magic possessed by feline animals. He is not good at rhetoric. Hitler is definitely no match for Goering in cold and sarcastic, confusing language. As far as lecturing is concerned, Weissford can certainly be a teacher without shame. Hitler's speeches are both scattered and circuitous. The words he uses are often unclear in meaning, disregarding grammar, and mixed with the vulgar language of northern Austria. I have to admit that if it weren't for listening to his words to hear what he meant to say, I would really feel annoyed. As for himself, he does not want to be annoying, because the trance-like conversations of a medium are not annoying.</p>
<p>In the crowd, Hitler becomes a temperamental, fanciful, and most painful person, like a shadow among them, creating an exaggerated, terrible, tense, and ghostly atmosphere. People are afraid of him and terrified of the masses he controls. Hitler is cruel, but he does not lose his love for animals and young children because of this. He is vindictive, like a woman. He never forgives or forgets hatred. Even a tiny gap, after a few years, he will still retaliate—the purge in 1934 is one example. I suspect that Hitler has never had a normal relationship with anyone.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Hitler will tend to peace. The reason for this has nothing to do with logic. Apart from war, he does not use logic at all. He is obsessed, relying on his illusory, cunning means, venting his anger and fearing that the world will not be in chaos. He is simply beyond reason. I firmly believe that if he ever started to reason, he would lose his "genius."</p>

<h3 id="e60">Grain Prices: Rumors of Subsidized Rice Prices Return, Speculation in Rice Weevils Grows Daily, Anticipating Successive Shipments of Rice <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of foreign rice has repeatedly soared, reaching its limit. Yesterday, a telegram from Hong Kong further reported a significant increase, coupled with rumors of a shortage of tonnage. As a result, rice weevil hoarders have become increasingly ambitious, with hardly any goods being displayed, and the overall situation is nearing a state of deliberate withholding. However, buyers are in a particularly difficult situation, feeling that there are no goods to purchase. Apart from some recycled goods slightly easing the emergency, only the Zhongguan No. 1 Siamese rice is relatively abundant in the market and is slightly available for sale, but the price is high and is approaching the limit. As for the small refined and No. 2 Saigon rice in the middle segment, they are almost non-existent. According to market estimates, recycled No. 1 Saigon rice is priced at 85 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan, Zhongguan No. 1 Siamese rice at 84.5 yuan to 84 yuan, especially with no market. Fire-refined medium at 84 yuan, old at 82.5 yuan, Mindang at 86 yuan, Zhongguan Burmese rice at 84 yuan, small refined at 76 yuan, medium rice Lu at 73 yuan to 72 yuan, broken tips at 67 yuan, No. 3 broken at 65 yuan. Depending on the type of goods, a hidden increase of over one yuan is added. If the hoarding rice merchants manipulate the situation, the previous situation of lacking goods to meet the market demand will definitely be repeated. Rumors of subsidized prices outside the market are still rampant. The Nanyang issue is indeed the only propaganda tool for these people. Although the orders are being processed, they claim that there are insufficient ships and dangerous shipping, leading to a resurgence of active hoarding. Futures prices have been raised by several jiao to one yuan. The prices are as follows: No. 1 Saigon rice for February delivery at 97.7 yuan, en route goods at 100 yuan, No. 2 spot at 94 yuan, small refined spot at 91.35 yuan to 92 yuan, 16-piece packaging at 91 yuan, February-March delivery at 89 yuan, February delivery at 89.5 yuan to 88.5 yuan, and Haiphong rice spot at 91.5 yuan. Over 1,000 tons were traded, and there are also 14,000 bags of spot rice. However, in new transactions, He Yi has already released 2,000 tons of small refined rice for February-March delivery, with the price still at 88 yuan. In addition, negotiations are still in progress via telegram.</p>
<p>Foreign rice shipments have been arriving continuously in recent days. The production prices of new transactions are low. Chinese and foreign merchants are still actively selling. In addition to Japanese merchants selling in the market, they are also directly arranging shipments to Shanghai. The Japanese merchant Yamashita's ship has already unloaded over 70,000 bags, and it is rumored that one or two more entire batches will arrive soon. Yesterday, the EldsrAdo ship, managed by the Baolong Foreign Firm, arrived from Saigon with 2,400 tons, totaling over 24,000 bags, and docked at the Pudong Longmao warehouse pier for unloading. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship arrived in Shanghai the night before last, carrying 738 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier in the French Concession. (Zu)</p>
<p>Due to the continuous soaring prices of foreign rice, the owners of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice have strengthened their resolve and are also trying to raise prices. However, the sales market is not as broad as that of foreign rice, making it difficult to achieve their wishes. Therefore, although the prices of various types have also improved, they have only increased by about half a yuan. The prices are as follows: Kunshan original japonica at 108 yuan, bulk at 104 yuan, second-grade at 101-2 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice bulk at 100 yuan, 99.5 yuan, second-grade at 99 yuan, original package at 106 yuan.</p>
<p>Large households continue to absorb glutinous rice, and the situation is also tight. However, it is not easy to fully raise the selling price, and it is still only slightly raised by half a yuan. The prices are as follows: Hong Kong special grade at 84 yuan, ordinary at 82-3 yuan, glutinous rice Lu at 76 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Vermicelli Orders Arriving Continuously - Spot Vermicelli Held Back, Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The foreign vermicelli market still looks promising. In terms of supply, entire batches of orders are arriving continuously. However, the rumor that British ships will suspend operations in the Pacific and the news that ships carrying vermicelli from Australia have been blocked in Hong Kong have made people optimistic. As a result, spot vermicelli in the market is being held back, and the supply is insufficient. It is difficult to predict when goods en route will arrive, so importers are not greedy. Clock Tower brand Australian vermicelli and Golden Dragon brand Kan vermicelli are being actively sought after by retailers and hoarders, so market prices are increasing. Clock Tower brand is priced at 25.85 yuan, Golden Dragon brand at 24.6 yuan, and Beautiful brand has jumped to over 26 yuan, all rising by 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day. Futures prices are quoted at 25 yuan, but there are no formal transactions.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains firm and quiet. The supply from both domestic and foreign sources is scarce. The stock of wheat in Shanghai is dwindling day by day. Although the market price has reached 40 yuan, no entire batches of spot goods have been sold. The price limits set by Japanese factories are still not relaxed. The price of high-grade Du wheat is 33 yuan, and lower-grade goods still require additional payments, so there are also no goods to be collected at the retail level. The market remains in a state of being withheld.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market did not lose its luster due to the mediocrity of soybeans. It rose and fell consecutively, but the results were still able to support it, which aroused the desire of the bullish companies. The market is under an organized monopoly, rising rapidly, and soaring by 4 jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction for Yuanlong cakes for February delivery was 5 cars, priced at 14.5 yuan to 6 jiao, and 2 cars for March delivery, priced at 14.75 yuan. The transaction for Shengji cakes for February delivery was 4,000 pieces, priced at 14.5 yuan to 6 jiao, 5,000 pieces for March upper delivery, priced at 14.75 yuan to 15 yuan, over 10,000 pieces for March lower delivery, priced at 14.85 yuan to 15.12 yuan, and over 40,000 pieces for April upper delivery, priced at 14.85 yuan to 15.22 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, miscellaneous grains were exported, including 1,500 bags of corn and 300 bags of peanuts, all transported to Hong Kong. 250 bags of beans were transported to Singapore, and over 2,240 pieces of soybean cakes were transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC exchange rate. The trend in the black market for British and American exchange rates was wavering. There were no significant developments in the international situation, and people's minds were calm. Speculators were both entering and exiting the market today, so the market softened and then relaxed. Although there were rumors that the Japanese were increasing troops on Hainan Island in preparation for further advances, the price remained tight. The US exchange rate was 5.65625 yuan, and it was difficult to settle at noon. The market was flat afterward, and buyers were lacking.

The market showed no changes in the balance of supply and demand. Speculators offered favorable US exchange rates for March delivery at 5.65625 yuan. The announcement of the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, and there were no changes in the silver balance tax. Afterwards, due to a shift in people's confidence, speculators suddenly had the intention to accept and entered the same month's US exchange rate at 5.625 yuan from a certain US bank and foreign banks. By noon, with relatively strong demand, the market was promising. The spot US exchange rate closed at 5.65625 yuan, and it was difficult to settle, retreating to 5.625 yuan. The US exchange rate was 3 shillings 14.453125 pence.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a fluctuating black market price that reversed and increased again. The price hovered around the 6,100 yuan mark. People's confidence was wavering but firm, indicating that the Japanese were unable to advance south and their attitude had softened, which became more obvious. Therefore, although there were rumors that the Japanese army continued to land on Hainan Island, it was generally considered unfounded. The foreign exchange market also tightened, leading to a high opening in the morning, which instantly jumped to over 6,100 yuan. The silver banks briefly sold small amounts to 6,070 yuan. The exchange market reported softening, and the gold shops Chengji, Rencheng Yong, and securities firms continuously absorbed, leading to a gradual increase. In the afternoon, it rose to 6,160 yuan. However, as the US dollar rebounded, Chengji (representing Western merchants) and bill merchants forcefully sold, causing it to fall back to within 100 yuan, ultimately closing at 6,125 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was over 20,000 taels. Swapping February to March delivery saw a buyer's premium of 40 yuan. There were no sellers offering premiums afterward. For spot gold, Deji released 50 taels from Zhongxing, with the forward price 380 yuan higher. Later, the price decreased. Zhongxing then released 10 taels from Fukang Yong, with a premium of only 330 yuan. The price rebounded at noon, and there were buyers in the afternoon at a premium of 360 yuan. The prices for ornaments and official gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Good for 90 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, people were extremely excited, and there was no shortage of buyers. Therefore, the opening price soared to 6,090 yuan, an increase of 55 yuan compared to the previous day's high. After opening, it further increased by over 100 yuan in a heated atmosphere, reaching 6,120 yuan. Soon, Hengji and Dafeng had intentions to sell and successively sold out, leading to a decline. The lowest point was 6,070 yuan. However, because the exchange market was flat with a tendency to soften, there were still many inclined to buy. Rencheng Yong and Chengji and others searched and gradually increased, rising to 6,130 yuan. However, Dafeng and Xinlanyong wanted to sell at high prices, and it was suppressed to 6,085 yuan. At this time, another buyer suddenly emerged, and Shunyuan, Chengji, Tongkang Yong and others vigorously purchased, and the trend became stronger, once rising to 6,148 yuan. However, Xinfeng Yong sold again, so it fell back to 6,115 yuan at noon. The result was a stable close at 6,130 yuan. The market opened flat and weak in the afternoon, at 6,120 yuan. The gold shops helped each other to stir up the buying trend, raising it to a high point of 6,160 yuan. Later, Chengji, Xinfeng Yong, and Rencheng Yong seized the opportunity to quickly sell, so it spiraled downwards, closing at 6,090 yuan. Before the close, Xiangxing and Yong and others made fragmented purchases, slowly returning to high, and as a result, it reached 6,125 yuan at the close, an increase of 90 yuan compared to the previous day. The closing price of 6,191 yuan based on the US dollar exchange rate of 5.625, and the actual price of 66 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 90 yuan. The selling price of the current gold sold by the spot gold shop was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot gold (spot), and the purchase was 30 yuan lower than the sale.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Securities: Foreign Stocks Slightly Rebounded, Public Bonds Showed Mixed Ups and Downs <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Although multiple parties were still trying to push up the black market price of public bonds yesterday, their strength had weakened. In the quiet and peaceful buying and selling, the market price slowly weakened. In the early morning, Xinfu first bought, raising the opening price to 6.5 yuan. Although it continued to pull up after entering, its strength was insufficient. After reaching 6.5 yuan for the second time, it gradually weakened. Although Xiekang, Dingkang, Hongda and others bought in, there were no large numbers. Lianhe, Tongshun, Xinhua, Runde and others successively sold out, and the noon closing price was 6.05 yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy in, but the number was limited. The opening price broke the 6 yuan mark. Xiexing, Yuanrun, and Runde slightly bought in, while Xinhua was still selling out. Tongshun and Xieda also cut their positions. The afternoon market fell by another 3-4 jiao, and as a result, except for Grade B, which was slightly better by 1 jiao, the rest fell by 2.5 to 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the public stock market was strong, and the shares that were settled with profits were generally absorbed in large quantities. At the close, the buying sentiment was very strong. Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden and Jardine Engineering continued to account for the largest number of transactions. The stock prices of various trust companies also made considerable progress. Among rubber stocks, the stocks of Dutch Indian companies were the most outstanding, and the price increased quite vigorously.</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Wang Gongxian stated, "When I read a certain evening newspaper the day before yesterday, I saw the statistical valuation of a certain trust company and a certain bank company, and I couldn't help but feel emotional. Because the above statistics are usually published on Sundays, why were they published on Thursdays in advance? Because of the tragic decline and crazy rise of gold stocks, the ones who suffered the most were still our Chinese people. Because outsiders cannot know the situation inside the stocks. If manipulators want to sell at high prices, they pretend to buy themselves, and at the same time issue dividends and bonus shares, but in fact they have secretly entrusted others to sell. Such as a certain bank company, it rose from 32 yuan to 49.5 yuan, and the manipulator sold out. Chinese people thought that the profit was great and there were also bonus shares, so they bought in. In three weeks, the price tragically fell to 15.5 yuan, and many victims among readers and friends. This time, unexpectedly, the situation suddenly became tight, and the stock suddenly fell, so that the manipulators could not sell out. From the current point of view, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the manipulators of stocks will have to find a way to sell out and escape. They will definitely think of tempting methods, raise stock prices, and trap the stock on the heads of blindly following compatriots, so that the manipulators themselves can escape. I myself am an experienced person and have suffered a lot. Seeing that the manipulators are using their old tricks again, I am here to advise you not to be fooled again."</p>
<p>The board of directors of Pumatay Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by De Kang Foreign Company, has approved the surplus for the year ending October 1940, totaling over 127,000 national currency yuan.

<p>The yarn market is stable, but the trend is slightly upward. At the same time, although there is no significant development in actual transactions, sporadic purchases continue unabated. Therefore, the industry's thinking is relatively stable, and the market price has slightly increased. What the future holds depends on whether the actual sales are booming or not. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,296 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,270 yuan. The afternoon started at 1,295 yuan, fell to 1,287 yuan, and the final price was 1,290 yuan. Today, 400 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened in the morning, and because the sentiment improved in the afternoon of the previous day, and most people were optimistic about the next step, even if the prices were weak, some people still bought in. The floor was not as alarming as the day before, but rather stable. The first pan price was 1,270 yuan, and buyers followed one after another. The market shouted for purchases again, and gradually rose to 1,296 yuan. It was then heard that the exchange rate and gold prices were both flat. In addition, the current sales were not very prosperous, and those who made profits came to sell out again, falling to 1,280 yuan. At this time, there were quite a few buyers. There were four or five rounds back and forth between 1,281 yuan and 1,285-6 yuan. Until the closing time, because the gold price was firm and rising, the market was revitalized, and the closing price was 1,289 yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in half a day were 6,593 packages. The amount of the quantity purchased by each gangkou is listed on the left,</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is slightly stable, but the factory's needs still show little signs of improvement. However, the mutual buying and selling among peers is more active, so the market is rising. Today, 30 packages of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market, because the spot transaction is good and the Wall Street stock is strong, so the purchase intentions of all parties are frequently increased, and the market situation has entered a strong and active state. As a result, the closing price was 4 to 13 pound sounds higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>There was no major change in Indian cotton. Yesterday's forecast was slightly higher by about one rupee.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, yesterday's yarn market had no major changes, and the situation in various aspects was still favorable for the purchase of raw cotton. Therefore, there were still several cases of mutual buying and selling among peers. As for the factory, it has not yet started large-scale procurement.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Piece Goods: Twill Fine Cloth Alone is Firm <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly firm, and people's minds were rising together. Dyeing factories on this street purchased low-priced grey fabrics, such as fine cloth and twill. The selling prices of goods have turned firm. Fugui fine cloth was sold in the morning for 40 yuan, and the asking price in the afternoon was 40.05 yuan. Fugui twill was sold for 34 yuan, and the market was sold for 34.5 yuan. As a result, the price of each piece of fine cloth and twill from various stalls increased by 2.5 jiao to 7.5 jiao. Coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were stable. Dyeing factories on this street purchased over 300 pieces of grey fabric. Wholesale retail shops sold over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, poplin, bleached and dyed goods in scattered quantities. The inventory of the Guangdong-Hong Kong gang continued to be loaded out, and new additions were still scarce, with close to 100 pieces being transacted. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang transacted 50-60 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market atmosphere turned firm, and the goods tended to rise. The closing price of white goods, Longtou fine cloth, was 44.5 yuan per piece, a rebound of 7.5 jiao. Because dyeing factories on this street searched for middle-grade fine cloths of various brands, each piece soared by about 1 yuan. The price of colored goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, 1.235 yuan, was also raised by about 2 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (22nd), 367 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 100 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and another 350 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Although the recent sales of golden needle vegetables have been dull, the ground is still firm. As the declared prices of production in Datong and Xuzhou are still difficult to calculate, the prices cannot be loosened. It was found that the lowest price for Datong vegetables was 118 yuan, but it soon rose again, opening at 128 yuan. In terms of the actual situation, it is difficult to loosen the prices for the time being.</p>

<p>The spot price of coking coal has increased recently due to the sporadic arrival of goods and the rising production costs. In addition, a certain iron smelting plant in this city has searched for large quantities, resulting in the depletion of old stocks, and the prices have soared. The black market price of Zhongxing coking coal has been quoted at 480 yuan, which is shocking. Kaiping coke is 320 yuan, Taiwan coke is 260 yuan, and additional transportation costs are added for delivery from the warehouse.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Japan's Hesitant Advance to the South: Comments from Shanghai-Based Japanese Military Claim the U.S. and Britain are Disrupting the Pacific Status Quo, Likening Japan to a Dove Forced to Incubate a Snake <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan's ambition to advance southward became increasingly blatant, the United States and Britain have resolved to halt Japan's continued aggression, even if it means resorting to military action. Consequently, both countries reiterated their advisories to withdraw their overseas citizens from the Far East, while simultaneously establishing defenses in Singapore and Guam. This proactive approach has caused considerable alarm in Japan, which has, on the one hand, feigned composure and, on the other, revealed intentions for peace. However, the United States and Britain prioritize actions over empty words, and their firm stance appears unshakeable. In its frustration, Japan has resorted to blaming the United States and Britain. This is evidenced by the statements of Japanese military spokesman Akiyama, and there is no reason to doubt their veracity.</p>
<p>Severe Criticism of Others, No Self-Reflection</p>
<p>Yesterday, at a reception for Western reporters, Japanese military spokesman Akiyama shockingly condemned the United States and Britain for being the first to disrupt the Pacific status quo, claiming that "Britain was the one who cancelled the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and the United States was the one who ruined Japanese-American trade. Therefore, Japan is constantly sacrificed by the United States and Britain." The spokesman used the analogy of a dove incubating an egg, saying, "The dove is a symbol of peace, but the egg is actually a snake. The dove is Japan, and the United States and Britain establishing defenses in Singapore and Guam, and sending Australian troops in a steady stream to Malaya, what is this behavior if not that of a snake? Japan is now like a dove forced to incubate a snake." He continued, "On one side of the Pacific, one shore is clamoring for war, and that is America. The other shore is singing the praises of peace, and that is Japan, on the other side of the Pacific." The spokesman also mentioned the words of automobile magnate Ford, "Let Britain and Germany fight it out," claiming that "President Roosevelt's foreign policy is imbued with this kind of thinking."</p>
<p>The Entire United States is Moving Towards Unity</p>
<p>An editorial in the English-language "China Press" stated that with each passing day, the sound of Japan's cries diminishes, while the voice of the United States grows stronger. A few weeks ago, Japan was filled with militant calls, while the United States remained silent. Now, Japan presents itself as a misunderstood peacemaker, while the United States has suddenly roused itself, issuing the voice of 130 million people united in purpose. A month ago, Japanese newspapers were filled with claims that seizing the Dutch East Indies would be as easy as turning one's hand, and that the United States would regret it if it dared to challenge them. And their spokesmen were loudly proclaiming that Japan would use force against anyone who dared to hinder their "unshakable policy."</p>
<p>America's Attitude: The Sword is Drawn</p>
<p>But the United States has suddenly drawn its sword, making it impossible to ignore. At this moment, Japan's belligerent attitude has suddenly cooled. Some may see this as a coincidence, but we believe otherwise. Previously, Tokyo's rhetoric was nothing but threats of war, but now it has all changed to talk of peace. Previously, the United States remained silent, but now the House of Representatives is discussing the Guam defense bill, and the atmosphere in the chamber is filled with a determination to confront Japan. Only one congressman opposes the bill. In light of Japan's words and actions since joining the Axis powers on September 27th of last year, no one will accuse the United States of provocative behavior. America is merely preparing to resist external aggression against it. Japan is simply getting what it asked for.</p>
<p>Japan's Misjudgment of America</p>
<p>The Guam defense is the first step in America's direct response to Japan in the Pacific. When this bill passed the House of Representatives, there was only one dissenting vote, which can be considered unanimous passage. The shift in national public opinion in the United States is evident, as this bill had been presented to Congress for a year but failed to pass. Japan has made misjudgments more than once, but the reckless behavior of the past four months is a record high. With its perverse intentions, it has aroused America's unwavering determination and spurred America's defense preparations. Japan has now transformed itself again, switching to a pleasant and harmonious tone. Unfortunately, America's nature is different, and it cannot sing a duet with them.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Rumors of Yu Qiaqing's Assassination are Pure Fabrication <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>For days, some parties have been spreading rumors that Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese councilor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was attacked and injured by thugs on the 14th of this month in front of the Hang-chow Club on Guangdong Road and has been admitted to a certain hospital for treatment. This has aroused the attention of various parties for a time. However, on the evening of the 18th of this month, when Municipal Council Secretary-General Philip Fellinger held a farewell banquet for Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Isabuchi Hidehiko at the Shanghai Club, Mr. Yu was invited to accompany him, which proves that the rumor that Mr. Yu was assassinated is completely untrue. Moreover, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency had a telephone conversation with Mr. Yu, who answered the call himself, which further proves that Mr. Yu is in good health.</p>
<h3 id="e79">"Special Police Headquarters" Rumored to be Established: Gambling Ban Ordered Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai West Police Agreement was signed on the 1st, it is said that the Shanghai West "Special Police Headquarters" will be officially established on the 1st of next month. The senior officials of the "Headquarters," the previously designated "Director-General" Pan Da, "Deputy Director-General" Krisha, and "Foreign Affairs Section Chief" Ho Er, etc., were formally appointed by Chen Gongbo the day before yesterday (the 19th). It is also understood that yesterday, the "Municipal Police Bureau" issued a "notice" ordering all gambling dens to close down in the near future. It is said that the various small gambling dens in the Shanghai West area (commonly known as "yellow cattle sheds") have ceased operations on their own accord in the past two days.</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the "Municipal Police Bureau" today issued an order requiring all gambling dens in Shanghai West to close down completely before the "Special Police" is established on March 1st. According to the "Continental Times," the Shanghai West "Special Police Headquarters" will be established soon. The "Municipal Police Bureau" specifically ordered all gambling dens in Shanghai West to close down completely on the 19th as the first step towards "clarifying Shanghai West." "Decisive measures" will also be taken against the gambling dens in the Nanshi area, ordering them to cease operations. It is understood that such positive measures by the "Police Bureau" are aimed at achieving a "guarantee of safety" in the security of all areas under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government."</p>
<p>Military Parade Temporarily Suspended This Year; Defense is Important, No Time for Exercises</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Board has approved the recommendation of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commandant to decide not to hold the annual Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review this year and to replace it with individual inspections of each unit. The reason is that most of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps members have been assigned to Zone B for defense duties since August of last year and are still stationed there. Each Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review requires considerable preparation and exercises. As for individual unit inspections, if they are held before the end of the training period, they do not require special preparation. For this reason, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review has been suspended for the time being, but this does not mean that this review will not be held again in the coming year.</p>
<h3 id="e80">French Municipal Council Studies Administrative Expenses: Economic Committee <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Since the French Concession "tax on Chinese" society donated to the Municipal Council in July of last year, the parent has added donations twice in the past six months starting in January of this year. "The ratio of donations: on July 1, 1940, the principal tax and surtax on housing donations increased from 17% to 22%, an increase of 5%." This time, the renewed donation increased from 22% to 30%, an increase of 8%. Other donations, such as land donations, meeting fees, and other miscellaneous taxes, have also increased significantly. Some of the increased amounts have reached more than double, which is not something that the average taxpayer can afford. After negotiations with the French Consul General and the French Municipal Council, it was stated that it was difficult to cancel the original proposal due to the Council's expenses. The food asked the Chinese councilors to continue negotiations in the board of directors. Now it is known that the French Municipal Council has established an economic committee to respect taxpayers' opinions, which is responsible for studying whether there is room for frugality in the Council's various administrative expenses, with the aim of reducing taxpayers' burden by reducing expenditures.</p>

<p>High Tide Overtops Roads; Heavy Fog Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Shanghai was almost shrouded in smoke and fog yesterday morning, the heaviest seen this spring, which greatly hindered traffic. From dawn onwards, it was difficult to distinguish people even at close range. To avoid collisions, trams leaving the factory early in the morning all drove with their lights on, as did other vehicles. The Whangpoo River was covered in fog, with the water and sky blending into one. All kinds of sails were temporarily suspended, and ships stopped entering and leaving the port. The heavy fog dissipated after 9 am, and normal conditions were restored.</p>
<p>Since yesterday, there has been a sudden high tide in the Huangpu River. The tide reached more than ten feet above the high tide mark from 1 p.m., causing tidal water to overflow onto the roads of the Bund, Nissho Building, and Alabaster Road, with an accumulation of water of an inch or so. The tide gradually receded after about an hour.</p>

The Police Department's Rewards Committee deemed the constables to be loyal, brave, resourceful, and exceptionally effective, and they were presented to the Council for approval to each receive a second-class medal for special meritorious service to encourage them.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Proposal to Improve the Current Situation of the Public Concession (2) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Nash</p>
<p>Reform Plan</p>
<p>During the five years from 1925 to 1930, the lenient concessions made by Britain and the United States to the expression of Chinese nationalism had produced revolutions in the social life, economic life, and municipal life of the Public Concession. For example, Chinese women could be seen in foreign dance halls, which was previously unimaginable. And because Chinese women are beautiful in figure, they make foreign women appear small. In other important undertakings, it can also be seen that Chinese people have a later-comer advantage over foreigners. Young Chinese can now trade directly with foreign countries without relying on Westerners for introductions. In municipal life, the theory of Chinese people also has an amazing organization. In 1928, Chinese people were also included in municipal organs that were previously monopolized by foreigners, but Chinese people still felt that the concessions made by foreigners were too slow, so the Feetham Reform Plan was produced, but the Chinese still felt that it was not enough. In fact, China at that time was only able to ask Britain and the United States for and obtain the rights that it should have had the ability to do. Even the unequal consular jurisdiction could be abolished. But the reason why the goal was not achieved at that time was not due to the intransigence of foreigners, but because China itself was not yet capable and because of the obstacles from Japan.</p>
<p>Gradual Method</p>
<p>During the brilliant period of China's political recovery, it demanded that its unlimited sovereignty be expressed in the Chinese Public Concession. Britain and the United States, based on the investigation by Judge Feetham, advocated a gradual approach, starting with a "transitional era" before discussing the "return of the Concession." Japan, on the other hand, advocated the immediate abolition of the Concession. As a result, the reconciliation between the Chinese concept of sovereignty and the existence of the British and French concessions was interrupted.</p>
<p>Serious Challenge</p>
<p>China's national and political development in the Far East was stalemated by Japan's obstruction, resulting in rapid degeneration. The same situation existed in the Shanghai Public Concession. The municipal evolution contributed by the 1931 Feetham Reform Plan was stalled by major political events. The Sino-Japanese Shanghai War broke out five years after 1932, and the full-scale Sino-Japanese War began in 1937. Thus, the two main protagonists in the Public Concession, namely Britain and the United States on the one hand and Japan on the other, had to redefine their policies to cope with the new situation. After a short but heroic resistance in the Shanghai area, the Chinese army moved westward, and the political organs also went with them. As a result, the triangular politics of Sino-foreign relations (namely China, Britain, and the United States) changed into a confrontation between Britain and the United States and Japan. As for the "Chinese organs" in the city, they are only a passive role. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, it has entered its fourth year. The fundamental tradition of international cooperation by which the Shanghai Public Concession is maintained has encountered a serious challenge. The outbreak of the European War has made this challenge even more tense.</p>
<p>Need for Cooperation</p>
<p>If there is one lesson we can learn from this, it is that if other driving forces such as "nationalism" and "sovereignty issues" extend into the Shanghai area during this period, there will be no peace in the city, and the chaos of order and the state of anarchy will continue to prevail. Because before the military has ended, there is little hope of integrating the different policies of England, the United States, Japan, and China. In this extreme situation, unless a miracle happens, all of Shanghai will sooner or later be swept into the vortex of chaos. However, we would rather not let this melee be delayed any longer, or there may be hope for a miracle. In any case, we, as citizens of Shanghai, should at least fulfill one obligation, that is, we should each exercise restraint and not cause a full-scale war in the Far East, even if war is inevitable, do not let our respective national goals, behaviors, or policies cause it.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Japanese Abduction of Laborers in the Northern District Becomes Increasingly Serious; Even Employees Hired by the Police Force are Not Exempt; Hundreds of Chinese Forced to Work <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported today (the 21st) that it has learned from responsible sources that the Japanese Army "Labor Corps" has been engaged in large-scale activities in the Northern District of the Public Concession, forcing large numbers of Chinese to perform labor for the Japanese Army. Japanese officials have denied that such activities are taking place in the area north of the Suzhou Creek occupied by the Japanese and have reportedly notified Japanese newspapers in the city to "take steps to curb such malicious news."</p>
<p>Forced by Force, Unable to Resist</p>
<p>However, according to reliable sources, those abducted in the past few days included an employee hired by the Yangtzepoo Police Force. It is said that the responsible personnel of the Northern District Branch of the Municipal Council's Health Department have also taken steps to ensure that their Chinese employees are not exposed to any danger and have issued armbands to the Chinese employees of the Branch for identification purposes. It is also said that hundreds of Chinese in the Northern District have been forced to work for the Japanese Army. Most of them are forcibly pushed onto trucks and driven away, unable to resist. Therefore, the Chinese in the Northern District are all panicked. It has been investigated that the Japanese army engaged in similar behavior in the northern part of the Public Concession in the second half of last year.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Public Works Bureau, Teramoto Hiroshi has been appointed as the Japanese Deputy General Manager to succeed Ibusuki Hidehiko, and is scheduled to take office next Monday (the 24th). Teramoto was born in Japan in August 1907. He passed the Japanese Foreign Service Examination in 1932 and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University the following year. In March of that year, he began serving in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was subsequently dispatched to the Japanese Embassy in London as a counselor, and in 1934, he was transferred to the position of counselor. In 1935, he was assigned to the Japanese Embassy in Rome. In 1937, he was assigned to the Japanese Embassy in Berlin. In February 1938, he was appointed as Secretary of the European and American Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In July of the same year, he was appointed as Consul at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During a reception for local Japanese newspaper reporters the day before yesterday, Teramoto stated that he would thoroughly study the affairs of the Public Works Bureau and that it would take a year to complete the study. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to expect him to achieve results quickly.</p>

<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that workers at the American United Industries Corporation on Pinlang Road had made demands for improved treatment at the beginning of last week. The management refused to start negotiations, citing the demands as "unreasonable." The workers then went on strike. Mediation by a third party was ineffective.</p>
<p>American United Industries Strike: Management's Attitude</p>
<p>It is heard that the outcome of this strike depends entirely on the attitude of the management. However, the management has not yet expressed a willingness to accept the workers' demands and has notified the workers that negotiations cannot proceed unless they first return to work. According to Japanese sources, on Wednesday, extortionists were apprehended inside a private residence in a certain alley on Yidingpan Road.</p>
<p>Extortionist Zeng Taken to Special Court No. 1</p>
<p>It was also reported that ten individuals claiming to be "union" members were extorting money from several barbers. They were arrested by the Japanese military police. It was found that on Tuesday, individuals impersonating "union" members were arrested for extortion and taken to Special Court No. 1 for questioning. It is not yet confirmed whether the extortionists arrested by the Japanese military police on Wednesday will also be taken to Special Court No. 1 for questioning.</p>

<p>At around 2 PM the day before yesterday, a fashionable man and woman, dressed in luxurious clothing, went to the New New Hotel, owned by the New New Company on Nanjing Road. They chose Room 404 on the fourth floor to stay in. After paying the rent, they walked out hand in hand. They did not return until around 11 PM that night, and then they closed the door and went to bed. The night shift tea boy initially paid no attention to the fashionable couple. They had already decided to die together inside the room. It was not until around 12 PM yesterday that the morning shift tea boy intended to enter the room to clean it. He discovered that the door was tightly locked and sensed something was wrong. He then managed to climb in through the window. He saw the male and female guests lying on the bed, both wearing underwear, barely breathing. He also found two medicine bottles and a letter on the dressing table. He knew that they had taken poison. He immediately reported the situation to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the police station. An ambulance was called to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, upon arrival at the hospital, the man had already died due to severe poisoning and could not be saved. Although the woman received emergency treatment, her life was also in danger. It was later learned that the deceased man was named Gu Ke-ren, around 30 years old, and the woman was named Tang Gen-mei, 25 years old. However, whether these are their real names is currently being investigated by the police station, who have taken the suicide note back to investigate the cause of death.</p>

<p>Hua Detective Du, badge number 72, of the French Police, hired a rickshaw to go home from the Great World at 11:20 PM on the 19th. While passing in front of number 389 on the west end of Poplar Road, Belle Road, two robbers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. They pressed down on the rickshaw poles on both sides of the rickshaw that the detective was riding in, ordered the rickshaw puller to stop, and ordered Detective Du to get out of the rickshaw to rob him. The two robbers reached into their pockets, pretending to be reaching for guns. Detective Du knew that he was being robbed, so he got out of the rickshaw and drew his gun, opening fire. One robber was shot in the back of the neck and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The other robber fled to number 94 on Gero Road, where he was shot in the buttocks, the bullet piercing his lower abdomen. He fell to the ground and was captured, taken back to the police station, and reported to the head detective. It was learned that the wounded robber's name was Yan Zhao-chang (25 years old, from Pudong, residing in room number 7 of the Yiding Small Inn on Yidingpan Road). He was ordered to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. As for the deceased robber, his name was found to be Chen A-san, about 30 years old, with no occupation or address. He had a long history of committing robbery and theft, and had been punished by the courts of both concessions. As no family members were found, the body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for encoffining and burial. The details of these events have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the wounded robber, Yan Zhao-chang, died at 2 PM yesterday afternoon in Guangci Hospital due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for encoffining and burial.</p>

<p>The Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road, which was approved to operate by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has obtained a license, has a wide sales network for its products. On July 18th of last year, a man named Zhang Xiao-tong (residing at number 11 of Chunhui Lane, Aerjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio from the company for 185 yuan. Several days later, Zhang took the radio to the company and requested to exchange it or get a refund. His reason was that the radio could not receive broadcasts from Chongqing and other places. Therefore, a dispute arose between the two parties. Zhang Xiao-tong recently filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of Special Court No. 1, suing Liangyou Wireless Radio Company and requesting a judgment ordering the return of the purchase price. Based on the complaint, the court, yesterday, ordered a hearing in the Civil Division 3 by Judge Dong. The defendant, Shi Ying-chi, appointed lawyer Wu Xiang-xian to appear in court. The plaintiff also appointed a representative to appear in court. Both sides held to their own arguments. Witnesses Lu Zhong-mei and Lian Yun were present to testify. The disputed radio had previously been sent to the plaintiff's residence for testing. The results showed that it could receive Chongqing broadcasts, but because the broadcaster spoke Cantonese, it could not be understood. The court reviewed the arguments and ordered that another three-day test be conducted, starting today, to see if the Mandarin language could be heard clearly. The case was adjourned to the 24th of this month for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Root of Superstition <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>"Now it's already the 20th century, why are there still so many superstitious thoughts?" a young friend asked me with emotion.</p>
<p>This is a strange thing that is not strange.</p>
<p>In this big world, there are countless small worlds. Everyone has their own small world. His environment, his education, his experience, his thoughts, the books he reads, the people he interacts with, and the places his footsteps reach, are the boundaries of his world.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this 20th-century society, there are many people who still live in the small world of medieval society and thought; in this seemingly prosperous Shanghai, there are many hungry and cold people; in this enlightened and scientific world, there are also many pitiful people who are imprisoned in the traps of ignorance, foolishness, and superstition. The truth of society is originally like this.</p>
<p>Speaking of breaking superstition, one cannot help but think of the movement of destroying idols and demolishing temples done by a group of vigorous youths. Their motives are undoubtedly pure, but their methods often only arouse greater aversion to new ideas. Our work is not that simple. We must instill them with scientific and enlightened thinking, we must rescue them from the deep well of superstition, and make them understand the narrowness of their past horizons and the errors of their thinking.</p>
<p>Eliminating superstition should be done thoroughly. What is the root of superstition? Ignorance. Ignorance is the root of superstition!</p>

<h3 id="e102">Women Born in the Year of the Sheep <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Li</p>
<p>After reading that article on the Free Talk a few days ago, "It's Difficult to Be a Woman," who wouldn't sigh and express sympathy for those unfortunate women? But the difficulties for women are not limited to this. As far as I personally know, once women are born in the year of the sheep, their lives will be more painful than any other women.</p>
<p>"A woman born in the year of the sheep often carries seven parts of bitterness; if she doesn't ruin her husband's family, she will ruin her own family." This is an unreasonable old saying that has been circulating for a long time. Unfortunately, women born in the year of the sheep are destined for this fate. If their family's situation deteriorates greatly after they are born, then they will unfortunately be regarded as the great enemy by their own parents, and few will not be sent to a nunnery! Once they reach adulthood, they will encounter pain everywhere. Sometimes, when she and a man are happily living a life of love, if he or his parents suddenly discover that she was born in the year of the sheep, then their love will be torn to pieces by the giant hand of a demon. Therefore, it is very difficult for a young woman born in the year of the sheep to find a spouse. Even if she finds one, she will mostly not be favored by her husband and in-laws.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who fell in love with a woman born in the year of the sheep, but their love was later destroyed by this old saying. It is said that his parents were even Christians! But what's the use of that? Believing in religion is one thing, believing in old sayings is another. In China, there is no sense of contradiction.</p>
<p>I am a man born in the year of the sheep. According to my parents, they had already decided two months before I was born that if I were a girl, then they would immediately send me to a nunnery without any doubt. Fortunately, I am not a girl.</p>
<p>I often find it strange that in such a civilized society, why are there still so many people who believe in long-standing and rotten, unreasonable old sayings? Are people not progressing? But why do these deceptive old sayings still follow us? I will never understand, I am strange. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e103">Washington's Strict Military Discipline <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Today (February 22nd) is the birthday anniversary of George Washington, the father of the United States. The independence of the United States owes much to Washington. Therefore, Washington's military methods are especially worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Washington's military manual was publicly exhibited in Chicago, attracting many connoisseurs. This booklet was written by Washington when he commanded the Independent Army in 1776 and includes several hand-signed orders, which can give a glimpse of his military discipline.</p>
<p>It is said that a habit of cursing was popular in the American Independent Army. Washington deeply hated this, so he specially signed an order, instructing all officers: "Cursing and swearing are stupid and improper behaviors. Speaking some blasphemous words is nothing more than a vulgar and despicable crime. May the officers set an example and not allow the bad habit of cursing to become popular in the army."</p>
<p>Washington also attached great importance to the morals of soldiers. The manual records his instructions to soldiers who secretly picked fruits from private orchards, condemning them.</p>
<p>Most of Washington's military manual has been lost. Only the portions from July, August, and September of 1776 remain in the New York City Command Headquarters, and were later acquired by the International Art Combination Company. In addition to the manual, the publicly exhibited items also included Washington's measuring instruments, buttons, shoe buckles, and a tortoise shell snuff box.</p>

<p>Mr. Luo looked like he had eaten Coptis chinensis, unable to say anything. On the other hand, Director Ma, who had achieved fame and success, still had a smug smile on his face, as if he was not concerned about the people who were working with him in the hall.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mrs. Luo, who had just moved from a dilapidated house to a magnificent new residence, encountered some boredom in her extreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Oh! This is our new son-in-law! Why hasn't he gone over there yet?" She was lying on a soft couch, watching the person in the photo busily greeting people back and forth in the house. It wasn't until the auspicious time had passed that she still didn't see him go to the place where the wedding ceremony was being held, so she quietly asked an old woman who was brought from Beijing by Yuan Zhenshoushi (garrison commander).</p>
<p>"This is our Seventh Master! Old lady, he is the great nephew of the new dignitary." An unexpected answer.</p>
<p>"What... what did you say?" Mrs. Luo, who was hemiplegic, almost wanted to jump up from the soft couch.</p>
<p>"He is the nephew of our garrison commander." The old woman repeated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Luo widened her eyes, unable to think of anything to say. Just then, Yuan Shaowen passed by outside the courtyard.</p>
<p>"Sor...ry...!" Mrs. Luo used all her strength to say to the old woman: "Please ask him to come in... I... have something to... ask... him. …"</p>
<p>The old woman immediately rushed to the door and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Seventh Master, please come here for a moment, the old lady of Third Auntie wants to talk to you!"</p>
<p>However, by the time Yuan Shaowen stepped into the room, Mrs. Luo was unable to say anything. (37)</p>

<p>— Ji Gu</p>
<p>The belly of the short woman living in the back building of the neighboring building grew bigger day by day, like a ripe melon that was about to come off the vine. However, she still often squatted by the tap with her big belly to scoop rice, wash vegetables, and wash clothes. While washing, she muttered to herself that her four daughters were "owe-debt ghosts."</p>
<p>The fat woman living in the kitchen came out and chatted with her:</p>
<p>"Is it tiring to keep squatting like this?"</p>
<p>"How can it not be tiring! It's all for the sake of those few owe-debt ghosts..."</p>
<p>"Okay, in a few days, we can eat red eggs! Be sure to send me a few!"</p>
<p>"Don't count on it, it only counts after they're born." Although she said this, she felt quite optimistic in her heart: "I've already given birth to four daughters in a row, this time it should be a son. If it's another…"</p>
<p>The short woman's seven-year-old daughter was playing at the door. The neighboring grandma asked her:</p>
<p>"Has your mom given birth? Was it a younger brother or a younger sister?"</p>
<p>"It's another younger sister. She's chubby and very cute, and cries with a strange loud sound. But Mom said she wants to throw her away..." Suddenly, the older sister, who was making coal briquettes behind her, pushed her hard. "Who said that? Mom said she was going to send the little sister to someone else to raise, who said throw her away?" She even wanted to hit her, scaring her away.</p>
<p>In the evening, the nosy one-eyed girl in the front building asked the short woman's eldest daughter in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Why is there no crying? Where is your little sister?"</p>
<p>"She was sent to someone else."</p>
<p>This morning, a small corpse, the corpse of a plump newborn baby, was found next to the trash can in the alley.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Hollywood's Flight Fever <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Toad</p>
<p>Recently, Hollywood male and female movie stars have been learning to fly one after another, and many movie stars own a private plane. Every morning, the residents of Pi Fuli Hill are awakened by the rattling sound. This "flight fever" is as popular as the "car fever" that prevailed in the film city 25 years ago, and is extremely popular for a while.</p>
<p>Among them, the one who learns the most diligently is Laurence Olivier, who vowed that after learning, he would join the Royal Air Force to serve his country.</p>
<p>Robert Cummins' "Spinach" plane has long been famous in the film city, worth 30,000 US dollars, and its flight record in the air has exceeded 1,000 hours.</p>
<p>But the one with the longest qualification is Hua Leisi Piley, who started learning to fly in 1925. So far, his flight record has reached 6,000 hours, and he has replaced nine aircraft. In Hollywood, he is the only one who has obtained special permission from Roosevelt to fly anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Although Tyrone Bauer's plane has been in use for ten years, his qualifications are very shallow, with only 75 hours of record.</p>
<p>Li Que Yalun was a member of the Royal Air Force in World War I. He was the protagonist of the famous film "Wing" in 1927. He has been researching aviation techniques and recently opened a school.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor's 145-horsepower aircraft is the most modern in the film city. He is very enthusiastic about flying, although his wife, Bai Peilan Standfei, opposes him practicing.</p>
<p>James Stewart is a strongman in the air, recently teaching Olivia Hafland flight skills at six o'clock in the morning every day.</p>
<p>Hafland's brother-in-law, Baila En Yaheng, is also a flying expert. His plane is worth 9,000 yuan. Recently, he is preparing to donate the plane to the British government.</p>
<p>Lei Milun, Jie Fei Lilin, and Wen Maolisi are all unwilling to lag behind, and are practicing secretly. Kan Luoer Folin's adventurous spirit also makes him double his efforts in his aviation skills.</p>
<p>Previously, only Rose Caidetun and Yidina Mankaober were the only female stars in the film city who could fly a plane. Now, however, the famous female stars Ganer Pandelik, Magelan Shaliven, Kesilin Hepburn, Xiulan Rose, An Su, and even Sarah Hatton, who is more than half a century old, are desperately practicing.</p>
<p>Who is Duanmu Lanxin</p>
<p>After Tang Ruoqing was "sick," the Xuan Palace stopped performing for a few days. Today, "New Mei Luo Xiang" is being re-enacted, but Sun Jinglu cannot perform on stage due to "certain reasons." The role of Mei Luo Xiang is played by the newcomer Duanmu Lanxin; in fact, Duanmu Lanxin is not a "newcomer" but a "new name," that is, "Vera" of the Drama Society.</p>

<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>I recently heard that someone is planning to open a theater on Yu Qiaqing Road, specializing in dialect plays. Since various theater troupes have tried to perform dialect plays, opinions have been divided. I believe that dialect plays can be performed, but attention must be paid to the limitations of time and space, and the actors must be familiar with the local dialect. Therefore, for dialect theater troupes that are being organized, if they truly have the ambition for long-term performances, the actors and the directing staff must pay attention. Whether the script can avoid causing panic is also something that must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>According to news circulating within the circle, Kodak film stock will be sold until it is depleted, and then orders will be renewed with the United States. This is also a small ripple in the midst of the turbulent Pacific situation.</p>
<p>According to a letter from a friend in Chongqing, a number of folk tales and wooden fish books from Hong Kong and Shanghai have been shipped to Chongqing, numbering as many as forty or fifty. However, it is quite doubtful how many of these forty or fifty films will pass inspection and be publicly screened in Free China.</p>
<p>I have heard that there is talk of reorganizing "China Film News," but the details are unknown.</p>

<p>— Hui Lin</p>
<p>Shirley Temple has decided to return to the silver screen. She has signed a contract with MGM, with a weekly salary of $2,500. She will co-star with Mickey Rooney in a large number of serial films. When asked for her opinion, Shirley Temple simply replied, "School life is too stupid."</p>
<h3 id="e109">"Sister Thirteen" <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Yu</p>
<p>"Sister Thirteen" was originally titled "Daughter Hero Biography," written by Li Yuru for Yu Yuqin of the Fushou Troupe before the year of Gengzi. Li, named Zhongyu, also known as Jianghuai Sanren, worked in the Ministry, and in his spare time, he also wrote signboards. He liked to associate with actors. Seeing that Yuqin could both sing martial roles and also excel in female roles, he arranged for her to perform eight episodes of "Daughter Hero Biography," performing the whole thing over eight days. The role assignments were: Yu Yuqin as Sister Thirteen He Yufeng, Lu Huayun as An Ji, Chi Yunqing as An Xuehai, Chen Ruilin as Zhang Jinfeng, and Qian Baofeng as Deng Jiugong; among them, Deng Jiugong was once sung by Tang Changer, Zhang Jinfeng, Big Dog Gao Sibao (Qingkui's father), and Zhao Xianfang all played Sai Shishi, Jia Honglin once played the old servant, the big monk was Dafantong, and the donkey driver was Tang Yuxi. At that time, it caused a sensation. The structure of the play strongly emphasized He Yufeng's loyalty, righteousness, and filial piety. Yu and Lu both became famous because of this play. After Yuqin, Wang Yaoqing also excelled in this play. Yaoqing did not practice stilt-walking, so he advocated using small boots to replace them. Yaoqing's martial arts skills were far inferior to Yuqin's, but her dialogue and demeanor were better than Yu's. Lu Huayun had a disciple named Rong Diexian (Cheng Yanqiu's teacher), who also searched for stilt-walking skills, but followed Yu and imitated Wang. Descendants such as Xun Huisheng's Furong Cao all had stilts but did not use them, choosing convenience and simplicity, and changing to wear small boots. Later generations such as Zhang Eyun, Mao Shilai, Ma Yanfen, Zhao Xiaolan, Zang Languang, Liang Xiujuan, etc., all only followed Xun, and some did not even know that He Yufeng should tread on stilts.</p>
<p>After Wang Yaoqing's voice collapsed, Xun Huisheng took the play from the point where He's father was harmed by treacherous officials, through "Yue Lai Inn," "Nengren Temple," "Mangniu Mountain," "Hongliu Village," "Qingyun Mountain" to "Bow and Inkstone Romance," and named the entire thing "Sister Thirteen," performing the whole thing in one night; adding Furong Cao's Zhang Jinfeng, Jin Zhongren's An Gongzi, Zhang Chunyan's An Xuehai, Wang Lianpu's Deng Jiugong (now played by Jiang Shaoqing), Sun Futing's Zhang Ma, Ma Fulu's former Sai Shishi and latter Dog Teng, Wang Duoshou's donkey driver, every performance was packed. Shang Xiaoyun also co-arranged and performed it, with Shang Fuxia as An Gongzi, Li Baokui as An Xuehai, Fan Baoting as the big monk, Gao Fuyuan as the donkey driver, Jia Duocai as Sai Shishi, Zha Jinkui as the old servant, and Xu Linfu as Zhang Ma. Xun also changed Shang's famous play "Leifeng Pagoda" to "White Snake" and rushed it to the stage. Xun and Shang became estranged because of this. In all fairness, Huisheng at that time was interested in using solemnity, with beauty but not flamboyance, heroic but not unrestrained, bold but not uncouth, not sticking to trivialities, and not overstepping the bounds, the female hero He Yufeng, and considered himself better than Xiaoyun. The "Qingyun Mountain" guarding filial piety scene can also depict He Yufeng's pure filial piety and nobility to the fullest; after Zhang Jinfeng is brought up, the singing of the meeting with Master Deng is so tragic that one cannot bear to hear it to the end; the rebuke of An Ji in the bridal chamber still does not lose the identity of a virtuous woman. There are many who perform this play now, but none are better than Huisheng. Xun will go south to perform in the Golden, and this play should be on the list of must-perform.</p>
<p>The Golden Gate Theater at the intersection of Foch Road and Albert Road is magnificent in architecture, well-equipped, with clear sound, soft lighting, and comfortable seats, and is recognized by movie fans. Now it is striving to select excellent films, sparing no expense, and from March 15th, it will exclusively screen the second run of MGM and RKO Pictures blockbusters, without increasing ticket prices.</p>
