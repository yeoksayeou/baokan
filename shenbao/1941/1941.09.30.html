<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰後之世界建設</h3>
<p>考現代人類之思想與生活櫛汨澎湃·眩目奪神，其進化之速誠如疾雷不及塞耳，而有不可思議者也。今日各國民族之兢兢業業，自强不息者，蓋所以谋人定胜天之道，而将其所有所得贡献与人类，以增进共同享受之福利爲個別或集體之立身行道。此未來世界的建設或人類文明的改造等類似問題、無論有戰事之間斷與否、於潛移默化之中醖釀成為現階段世界之中心問題，固早為哲人所識破，而我人亦勿憚辭費，幾經為之闡述。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相在艦上會談，其內容率多秘而不宣，但其範圍之廣。而必以世界人類之生活爲解決各種問題之歸宿，自無疑義。是故戰後人類生活之動向，勢將在此「大西洋人權方案」中尋繹其要旨。</p>
<p>近日來倫敦正在熱烈舉行科學討論會，而其所揭櫫之鵠的，即爲戰後之世界建設，首以如何維持被侵略國受殃人民之生活爲先決問題，以及於生產方式暨經濟制度中之一切調整事宜。於此可見今後之世界建設行將集中於整個經濟機構之改造已漸具體。經濟人生之將遭重大革命，其趨勢已豁然開朗。</p>
<p>英國代表說明戰後之生產機構殘缺不全，欲謀恢復舊觀，自非朝夕之間所可奏功，因此一部份國家須為其他民族担任供應給养、猶如此時民治陣綫國家之須仰賴美國供給軍械然。但是問題之牽涉於生產方式與交易政策者至深且鉅。為他國而生產，其國際間之收支，將何以清算？其利得將自何出？其交易之手續有何準繩、皆無着落，而槪須從長計議。或有謂可循以往之之途徑而謀獲解決之道，然其結果，或將重蹈第一次世界大戰後之覆轍。勞動能力自一九一八年以還，列强謀恢復舊制，早已筋疲力竭，終於失敗、而復促成第二决大戰之爆發。是以制度之須予以澈底改造，絕無非議之餘地，但如何改造則有待於各國人士之共同研究與解決。</p>
<p>論調所可預言者，嗣後生產，消費，交易與分配等問題，斷無若以往可聽各國自由爲之，其將受各國間之互相牽制與互相支配勢必變本加厲。若生產低效率之國家勢將遭受生產高效率國家之壓迫，以致放棄是項生產，皆在意料之中。設我人欲製造汽車，而由於效率之不如他人，必須放棄是類生產之企圖，則前途如何，不待智者而言。生產如此，消費亦然，所謂獲致共同享受之目標，計將安出，是誠值得研討者也。</p>
<p>熟稔現代問題者指謂戰後將有金鎊集團，馬克集團美金集團，蘇聯集團，與日金集團之產生，各劃勢力範圍，容納弱小民族。在大範圍間，則謀實現有條件之自由交易之制度，而所有弱小民族區域則將盡淪爲傾銷尾閭或料供給之場所。</p>
<p>雖然將來經濟制度之必須改革，固屬公認之論斷，究其改造之程度與方式，則有待於戰事之演變與人類之決心爲準耳。駐英蘇聯大使邁斯基之致詞，堪稱一針見血。渠指蘇聯二十年來由於私人經濟制度之缺陷，而獲得之改造敎訓不一而足。今欲鎔全世界之經濟機構於一爐，其責任之重大與艱難，當遠超過於蘇聯一國之革命。</p>
<p>今闡明吾人之立場與期望。吾國民風敦厚，與世無爭，此為天下所共鑒。晚近由於內亂外患之相煎，科學上雖未有重大之成就以饗人類，但數千年來砥礪自苦而得保存偉大之東方文化與物資富藏以供應友邦之需要者，亦未始非吾人之貢獻。吾人為主權而戰，自必為民族生存而爭。吾人將盡最大努力與友邦人士合作、以謀整個人類之幸福，但吾人自由獨立之生活條件必須完整無缺而有望於友邦之支撐。際此世界建設討論之始，冀以此正告與會諸君。并勗國人！</p>

<h3>美日對遠東　政策大相逕庭　經濟戰爭事實已存在　射擊戰爭危險性極大</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日紐約電　現今美日間發生射擊戰爭之危險性、其重大巳被認爲係該兩太平洋國家自發生關係以來所未曾有、血戰是不可以避免、實爲任何人所懸揣者、許多在華盛頓及在遠東之美國人士皆以爲、在最近之將來、吾人之軍隊在太平洋方面作戰之可能性、較在大西洋方面爲大、但大多數公正無偏之觀察家皆謂、美日皆不欲發生射擊戰爭、雙方領袖現時之一舉一動、皆極審愼、以避免有不得不戰之</p>
<p>公然行動</p>
<p>此種空前未有之局勢、係由長久而複雜之連貫事件所引起者、此種事件可概括簡述如下、華盛頓政府係致力於制止全世界各地之侵略、以合法及和平之手續、解決國際爭端及維持東亞之原來狀况、日本則致力於使東亞國家聯合並取消西方帝國主義如英國之統治馬來、荷蘭之統治東印度及中國之外國租界等、叉使必要之原料如東印度之油等可自由獲得、又至少在推論上將逐漸消除白種人對於數百萬亞洲人之統治、華盛頓係列日本爲侵略國、並引中日在滿洲之衝突及中日軍隊在中國本部之不宣而戰、以證明日本之決心以武力奪取其所欲得者、東京則吾認侵略之責任、並謂滿洲及中國戰爭之發生、係由於中國之違反協定及有不法行爲、依照日本之見解、日本之以日本孟祿主義而樹立其自巳在東亞之利益範圍、實與美國之自認爲滿洲共和國之領袖及美洲防務之代表同樣合理、日美政策</p>
<p>直接衝突</p>
<p>之點、似爲華盛頓之宣布主張雜持東亞原狀、日本如果建立以日本爲領袖之東亞國家集團、則東亞之原狀、顯然不能保存、東亞國家集團之設立、雖遭英·美之反對、業已有相當進展、「滿洲」國已成爲一與日本有密切同盟關係之國家、中國沿海地方大部份及內地據點如漢口及南海軍事據點如海南島等、皆已爲日軍所控制、而日軍復依據與法國所締結之協定控制越南、估計越南現駐有日軍五萬或五萬以上、並有坦克車及飛機等爲輔、在越南之南日本控制史潑萊羣島邊緣之全部珊瑚島、使日本幾與菲列濱之海岸相接、華盛頓爲對抗日本之繼續擴展、亦曾迭有行動、起先則亦責日本之侵略滿洲、繼之以在外交上宣布取消關於日·美國交之基本條的、以和借軍用品援助中國與英國及荷印、台作保衛彼等在亞洲東南之利益、事實上與日本經濟絕交、並援助日軍所久已認爲敵人之蘇聯、日美間之經濟戰爭實現已有數星期、但兩國之</p>
<p>外交關係</p>
<p>依然維持、預料將維持至有公然之行動爆發時始已、公然行動之可能性甚多、下列各項亦包括在內、日本之暗示威嚇將截留其他運載汽油及他種物品至蘇聯遠東海港海參崴之美船、日木爭論謂美國至海參崴之軍火路錢設立後、將增强與日本同盟國德國作戰之蘇聯之遠東軍、且將造成蘇聯或將用以對付日本之軍事準備、父或將使蘇聯將其軍火之一部貸與中國、以供繼續對日本作戰、如美船果爲日本軍艦所截留則兩星期之內、將發生爆發之局勢、其决則爲大量日軍之駐在越南與泰國接壤之處、泰國係英·美所同欲保衛者、因泰國控制通臨英屬馬來、新加坡及緬甸、經由著名之滇緬路而運送美國供給物品進入中國之地點、幷在控制之下、據信、日軍如進入泰國、則英若確定得美國之車事援助、將與日本作戰、最後則爲表現於軸心以之爲　秩序骨幹之三强公的之德·意·日同盟、如羅斯福總統及邱吉爾首相欲實踐具消除希特勒軍事機構威脅之諾言、則此德·意·日之同盟、顯然必須由英·美使用壓力以毀滅、（特的員美退休海軍少將斯忒林曁特派員伏恩發）</p>

<h3>紗花　利用雜紗昂貴　雙馬廠單被搜一空　行情抬到一千八百四十元外</h3>

<p>股票交易、成交中一信託公司設二百股、價爲二十一元五角、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市造謠　企圖抬價</h3>
<p>昨日洋米早市、形勢頗見滯軟、迨中市稍又活絡、當時開小絞百十三元半、百十三元、如此路徘徊、無甚變化、直將收市之際、忽謠米商以無可造謠、忽傳四行撤退空氣、一時人心激昂、形勢頓見鬨動業內外新囤大戶旣羣起吸收、而浮散等戶、亦跟蹤競辦、繼之實銷並相點綴、於是賣買扳喊若在、各價飛騰、收盤銀行棧小紋己抵百十五元、外棧百十四元半、而一號西貢高貨開出百二十八九元、中關亦須百二十五六元、碎尖九十元、八十九元、較之週前見漲二三元不等、至於其他各貨、因爲時已晏、未能一一開出、英華司曾開一百三十九元、繼叉回好至一百三十九元半、决一百三十元零五角、二號暹邏一百三十一元半、均與上週相似、成交的一萬五六千包、英華司五六百噸、</p>
<p>新破兩粳因一朝停市、且屆西新上市、出新漸旺、致來源頓夥、而銷塲反受洋米影響、依然不暢、故貨主皆甩價競脫、結果南港早破開百四十五元至百四十三元、計貶二元左右、而新粳則以到貨更湧、銷首允稀、猛甩四五元、開崑山新粳百五十元、浦東新粳百五十一元、</p>

<p>小麥到兩枯、久呈挺俏之像、近被米粉邀漲牽制、更見逐步喊高、昨因無錫蘇州產地先後漲達每石七十五元、執貨者更爲居奇、昨高杜麥已喊到每担五十元、日廠放價到四十七元、仍乏整數收進云、</p>

<h3>現行結匯辦法　英美商絕對擁護　不惜犧牲務使澈底有效　奉行本國法令與華合作　菸葉汽油棉蔴糖等准給相當數額外滙</h3>
<p>若干外商領袖與銀行家、以平準會供給外滙試行辦法、自付諸實施後、不無發生困難之處、故於上週曾數度召集會議、研究有建設性之辦法、擬具一建議書、派代表携赴香港、交平準會參考、並面呈一切、茲據大中社記者探悉、此舉目的、無非對過去結滙情形、作一報告、對未結滙辦法、條呈意見、英美商人現均堅決表示、彼等將不顧一切犧牲、擁護中國政府管理外滙之政策、務使澈底有效、如平準會能派大員常川駐滬、允所歡迎、</p>
<p>美商表示　切實合作</p>
<p>記者昨晨會訪美國商會秘書哈瓦斯氏於福州路會所、據稱、「渠曾聞有若干著名商行及保險公司、確於上週開會檢討外滙問題、惟該會並未參加、渠所得知之消息、大致與報載相彷彿、」哈氏並表示、美國商人自當切實奉行美國政府法令、同時、與中國方面密切合作、以維護美國商人利益、</p>
<p>現行辦法　尙稱便利</p>
<p>又據麥加利銀行某高級職員談、特准按照新滙率辦理匯務之各銀行、其第一批申請書、係上月十八日寄呈平準會、以各行事前均能按照平準會各項規定審愼辦理、故核准者多、被拒絕者少、大致非全部拒絕、即全部核准、准結一部者極少、申請書由航輸直接帶港、自香港會議重訂九月份試行辦法後、滬市必需品、即已列入禁止進口物品表者、如烟葉汽油棉蔴糖等、亦均予供給相當數額外匯、範圍旣大、於合法進口貿易、尚稱便利、下月份將照舊實行、不致另頒新辦法、但投機商人活動旣受有限制、或告停頓、當然不無非難之辭、今次外商銀行召集會議、參加者僅匯豐。麥加利。有利·花旗·大通·五家、以九月份轉瞬即逝、十月份將屆、各行自須作一總檢討、向平準會報告、並條呈意見、各銀行旣接受英美兩國政府勸告、體會時艱、不惜犧牲、毅然停止黑市買賣、則義無反顧預料凡有建議、必具有建設性、務使辦法嚴峻、能完成中美英三國政府在政治外交經濟上之目的、</p>
<p>若干問題　毌庸顧慮</p>
<p>至外間對現行辦法、認尙有缺憾、據負責方面之解釋如下、（一）自申請以至核准、因交通關係、須費相當時日、平準會力求辦理迅速、恒有不必要延宕之說、並非事實、（二）對於商人請求供給外匯、於申請書內、須載明用途及分配情形、由銀行爲之保證無訛、故平準會除愼重審查其是吾確實外、似無其他方法、將合法商人與囤積操縱者、加以區別、（三）所結外匯、係有限額、如何分配、須視實際情形、隨時變動、（四）至謂商人可同時向十四家銀行申請外匯、事實上不可能、以擬向何家銀行辦理押匯、始得由何家銀行代爲申請、在申請核准後、方能辦理押匯手續、如有朦蔽情形、平準會極易發現、此則無須顧慮者、（五）滬滙市平準工作、平準會早巳派有專員一人、在滬主持一切、如能冉派大員來滬、當然爲外商銀行所歡迎、</p>
<p>兩報痛斥　圖利行為</p>
<p>平準基金會對滬市供給廉價外匯一事、關係滬市經濟生活、旣深且鉅、大陸報昨曾著一文、題爲「平準基金會與壟斷居奇」、就本埠進口商人之行爲、批評平準會之措置、略謂、由於進口商之惟利是圖、設置平準會之宗旨、似已被忽視、須知平準工作、首在對日本及其軸心國家、在滬市實行經濟戰爭、簡而易行之法、儘可完全拒絕供給滬市外匯、防止流入不友好方面、但中國政府及英美協的國、均不願使滬市及其他淪陷區之經濟生活、一任他人擺佈、不幸多數享受優越外匯之進口商、不顧平準會目標、利用機會、惟利是圖、壟斷居奇、一如奸商所爲、據外籍經濟專家阿勒斯最近在密勒氏評論報發表之評論稱、罐頭牛肉在凍結令實施前、每聽價僅美金五元半、今則需美金八元、惟就外匯情形而論、此項價格、固不應增高也、氏建議應立即規定小壟斷不囤積爲准給廉價外匯之條件、管理方法之缺點、亟應加以糾正、務使損人利己之壟斷居奇行爲、不復存在、爲滬市商人留一汚點、</p>
<p>華商銀行　同樣辦理</p>
<p>本埠華商銀行、以未備美政府特頒照會、按理不能經營外匯業務、後經四行疏通、仍得代客請求供給外匯、但必須由中國交通兩行轉呈平準會核准、華商銀行與平準會直接不發生關係、而由中國或交通居間、刻各華商銀行巳自中國交通兩行方面、取得各式申請書、分發各有關客戶、依式塡寫後、業交中交兩行、轉呈平準會核准、原由中交所得之佣金、則由華商銀行收受、故大陸·興業·墾業·實業·金城·中南·華僑·東亞·中興·上海等華商銀行均得開始經營外匯業務、各種手續、完全一致</p>

<p>改航理由　秘而不宣</p>
<p>至該輪再駛香港返美之理由、該公司秘而不宣、但此决由南洋乘該輪來滬之旅客亦寥寥、即南洋回美之乘客亦不多、本市乘該輪赴美者的一百餘人、</p>
<p>旅客姓名　拒不披露</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海居民若干人、搭從馬尼刺駛滬之披亞士總統號郵船抵滬、惟彼等之姓名皆未可知、因美國總統輪船公司依照新命令、拒不披露任何旅客之姓名、其保守之嚴密、如同保守軍事秘密、聞該公司今後不復發表總統輸之進口或出口旅客名單、</p>

<h3>沈有乾博士講　「思考之訓練」（續）</h3>
<p>三、思考歷程分析研究思考的歷程很困難、心理學上方法不外二種、一·客觀方法、二·主觀方法、客觀方法太精微、用工具不一、使人無從觀察、而語言與思考並非同一、蓋啞叭亦能思考、如用電流來測騐腦中的思考動態、亦不會有結果的、主觀是靠經騐等空想、所以此二種都沒有結果、杜威所講的五步法比較可以應用、第一須有疑難、以引起思考、第二辨析其動機、第三加以假設、第四加以推演、第五證騐與實際合吾、如覺第一假設不對、便推翻後又另立一假設、這樣又回到第三步驟上重行推演、比較複雜的問題、可以全部適用、亦有假設已很明顯、無需證騐、則第四五步便可省去、或即從第三步起、這是問題簡單的通用法、現在再加以解析一下、Ａ（疑難）思考須有動機、所以先要訓練發現問題之能力動機有三、一·實際上的困難、這是自身比較熟悉的、如問題太遠了、便難解決、二·理論上的問題、如云、金屬比水重、而小針却能浮於水面、於是研究的人起了疑心、發生了問題、第三種是顏面的保持、大多數人要保全他的面子、如事情失敗時他却對工具發生疑心、以爲是工具害他、此種可疑情形很可笑、　樣思考是　有益處的、疑難的程度與動　的强弱有關、因不顯著的困難不足以引起思考、過度的困難亦可使情緒慌張、减低解決的希望、所以訓練時問題不可太難、亦不太易、Ｂ（辨析）分析問題之成功或失敗、要視　　問題之熟悉與吾、如　問題不熟悉、便難分析、故有效之思考有賴於廣博與正確之智識、獲得一智識　接亦即訓練思考、然現一代的智識是很複雜的、專家們一對本行雖很知道、但其他亦與常人一樣、故敎育的目標要廣博與專精並重、就是一切事情要都有些知道、有些事情要一切都知道、而訓練時要虛心、勿冒充內行、Ｃ（假設）假設是思考的中心關　、缺假設則無從據以觀察事實、有時事太多、不能有聞必錄、必須選擇加以假設、然不應荒誕無稽、不合科學定律、須可以據以推測事實的、不過定律亦可以推翻、以前風行一時而現己推翻者甚多、如相對論和牛頓的論理學是矛盾的、而現在相對論勝利了、所以初步假設對一切都可大胆、到發表時才小心加以考慮、如粗心則成笑柄、Ｄ（推演）推演是最確定的一步、亦是最易見錯誤的一步、最普通的錯誤、一·是充足與必需的分別，就是一個條件不能看成爲全部根據、二·「是」與「等於」之分別、就是槪念的事物與單位的差異、三·注重結論是吾合事實、而不管推演是吾有效的錯誤、因為推演須要發展的、如注重直覺便無效矣、四·普通文字上的不正確之缺點、引起推演的錯誤、如書健美靑年、誤以爲父健又美的、男女靑年、誤爲或男或女等、Ｅ（證騐）推論的結果、如與證明不同、仍有推翻之餘地、故觀察應注意客觀事實、方爲可靠、如單憑主觀、與事實不符、便不可靠、觀察時若取少數樣子來代表一般事實、是有危險性的、訓練證驗要精密、要公牛、宜　　假設符合或不符合者同在搜集之列、不可固敎成見、態度方而的訓練是要在平靜事物中發生問題、取取大膽的相反方面的假設、從事實的統計上加以證實、方能達到新的思考階段、完</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>第三线戰略</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>世界上的事情，，往往是有兩面看法的。希特勒東征西伐，囊刮全歐，固然稱雄時，但是他同時也使全歐洲被侵略國的人民，成爲他的敵人。這也許就是所謂「有其利必有其弊」的吧。</p>
<p>德軍侵蘇以後，論者謂希特勒同時有三條戰綫：東面是蘇聯，西面是英國，而腹部却有淪陷區的人民和怨聲載道的本國民衆。東西兩條戰錢，結果勝利誰屬，尚在未可知之數，而論者多以爲希特勒的失敗，大多將失敗在第三條戰綫。</p>
<p>然而希特勒對於這所謂第三條戰綫，也並不是熟視無睹的。他對於本國人民的不滿和淪陷區民衆的怨憤，也有其特殊的戰略，前者是用隱瞞和欺騙，後者是用壓迫和殺害。</p>
<p>據孟却斯特導報稱，德國因爲糧食缺乏的關係，巳經禁止全國魔術家表演「雞蛋失蹤」，「帽中產兎」，「空袋生鴿」這一類與食物有關的戲法，以免觀衆看後，垂涎欲滴</p>
<p>這固然也是巧妙戰略的一種，但是這種戰略能够施行多久，却也成一個問題。</p>
<p>人情</p>
<h3>美國陸軍報紙一瞥</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>美國陸軍實行强迫兵役制後，共得新兵六十六萬九千五一百名。這些新兵平時本來過慣一自由生活，一旦到了軍隊中，過不慣紀律化生活，就不免發生「苦悶」，苦悶之餘，用文字表達出來，公之於世。</p>
<p>美國新入伍的陸軍各部隊，部各自發行報章刊物，由各士兵自由發去意見，抒寫胸懷。計自今春以來，這些報紙的產生如雨後春筍一般，比第一决參加歐戰時出版的刊物還要熱鬧。這些軍中報紙，有的公開發賣，有的免費送閱。</p>
<p>陸軍刊物的內容和作風，與第　次歐戰時出版的大同小異，質言之，都是談些風月膩情，及與此有關的副作品。士兵階級執筆之際，歡喜衝刺長官，毫不容情，這種作風，也和二十五年前相同。用新聞的術語講，就是士兵觸犯長官不足爲異，長官訓斥士兵，乃成爲奇聞。</p>
<p>這類供武士發洩文思的報紙，總數的二百零二種，以三日刊居多。其中風頭最著銷路最廣的是「巴拿馬沿岸砲兵新聞」，它在運河地帶的採石山兵營出版，主筆是個名叫「陶斯脫老夫子」的軍曹。報紙內容充滿熱烈情調，讀者遍於國內外。又有一種名爲「營囊」，是波士頓軍站駐軍發行的，質量豐富，他報無出其右，全份報紙的有書本大小五十頁，並有彩色封面。正是堂皇美觀，內容也多下里巴人之曲。但它很是幽默，樂而不淫，謔而不虐，譬如發人隱私他們用的如下的筆調：「軍曹，一味獨擅某姑娘的午餐舞，不知停歇，是何道理？讓別人也分潤一杯葵罷！連我們也在內！……」「裴而屈伍長已有新的中意人，也是一個狡猾的小東西，…」「格林軍曹的兩個女伴爲什麼老是前來跳舞？」</p>
<p>兵士的報紙，原是他們生活的反應，如第一决歐戰時，軍隊實行計口授糧，士兵們都怨聲載道，現在已不再發現這種情形了。</p>
<p>然而桃色新聞和低級趣味，究非軍隊報紙的全貌，即使最趣味化的軍報編者，也小得不騰出巨大篇幅，登載軍隊行動，軍隊操演及陸軍新配備的消息，並登載長官的言行及運動比賽情形。每報都特闢一欄，供軍中收師報道消息。</p>
<p>軍中也有疏疏落落幾位詩人，散播其問，他們的作品有的緾綿悱惻，有的立意玄妙，但大抵以輕鬆爲主，弗洛利達州勃倫亭軍營出版的「葡萄葉，佳作如林。詩體複雜，以押韻爲貴，開頭往往是：</p>
<p>吻別我卿新英蘭，</p>
<p>見她眼中一點淚，……</p>
<p>同時，軍中還有不少藝術家，畫出奇妙的卡通，登在報上，不是調侃某甲把大菜义裝在槍口上，代替刺刀，就是直描某乙被長官在兩脚上繫着「左」「右」的字條，辨別方向。這些報紙在出版前，都經過情報官檢查，倘不洩漏軍事秘密和犯重大錯誤，都可放行。</p>
<p>總之，美國陸軍報紙難然玩笑百出，不登大雅，究竟是寓敎於樂。這些報紙送到各士兵的故鄕，博得父老友朋們的一粲，也可省去一番寫家信的麻煩呢。</p>

<h3>燃燒筆</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>在戰爭發生的時候，參戰國當局所注意的，除了戰塲上的勝敗以外，還要防止敵方的間諜活動與破壞工作。在第一决歐戰的時候，有一部分重要科學家，製造一種形似自來水筆的燃燒彈，以便實施破壞工作。此種燃燒彈外形雖小，可是燃燒的力量極强，其火燄的熱度，可以洞穿鋼板，曾使由美駛歐的船隻和貨物，遭受極大的損失。在這美國積極援助中英蘇聲中，美國軍事當局，對於這種「燃燒筆」，極端注意，以防不軌之徒的破壞。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「這是有憑證的，縣裏的警察局都知道有這件事！」秋海棠透着很理直氣壯的樣子說：「因爲我女兒是縣立初中的學生，她給姓尚的一拐走，校裹的方校長便立刻去報告警察局，後來警察局還把姓尚的一個朋友帶進去問過三次。你們不信，今天就可以去問！」</p>
<p>這倒不是那個巡官所能預料到的了！他眞可以對天起誓，無論怎樣，他不會想到像道樣一個衣衫敝舊，家業蕭條的莊稼人的女兒，會上縣立初中去念書。</p>
<p>「原來還有這樣的事。」他想縣立初中大小也是一個機關，况且局裹己經有過案子，自己要是依舊照着李巡長的囑咐，再向秋海棠漲施威嚇，那就未免太不知趣了，因此態度便馬上變得溫和起來。</p>
<p>「他們丟了一個兒子，平白地就會找到人家身上來，我的女兒淸淸楚楚給他小舅子拐到了北平去，難道他反充不知道嗎？你們不信，馬上就可以去問他自己！」秋海棠繼續氣憤憤的說。</p>
<p>「我哥哥到此刻還在京裏找那姓尚的傢伙咧！」張老六也在旁邊補充了一句。</p>
<p>「好，旣然這樣，待咱們回去報告了再說吧！」那巡官便自動收下篷子，搭訕着走了。</p>

<h3>吳素秋婚變記（下）</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>吳素秋見了記者，絲毫不露感情衝動的表示。她說：「和霖太不上進了。我不能跟他受罪。他紙烟不離嘴，嗓子不知那天恢復，怎麽好呢？」「可是，我們倆的事，絕不是因爲我有了男朋友，或是他有了女朋友，請您不要誤會。」秋兒解釋地說，</p>
<p>記者見了王和霖，是一個廿二歲，翩翩的少年，無怪秋兒愛過他，大概除了腰包裹不如八人少」以外，講外表，和秋兒真是一變「璧人」。他說：「我早已知吳素秋有了外務。前些時我和她出門閒走，要求攝一個紀念影她都不幹，可見她對我是沒有「愛」了，我何必强求呢。我不希望什么「破鏡重圓」，從現在起，我倒要用上功，不久組班出演，看看將來誰行誰不行。」</p>
<p>王和霖也許給此上進了。</p>
<h3>破鏡重圓的吳素秋</h3>
<p>情絲難斷　素秋大哭</p>
<p>事情有些奇突，吳王愛情是決裂了，婚書是燒掉了，可是，吳素秋在二人瓜葛已斷　那天（十九日）早晨，忽然同她妹妹到王和霖家、恰巧王和霖不在，秋兒坐在王和霖的銅床上，——就是那不久以前，她倆還是那裏談情說愛的地方，回思前景，掩面大哭。王家的人，不知如何勸法才好。結果，送上洋車，拉回吳家。</p>
<p>秋兒是後悔了呢？是在外邊受了什麽大少的氣，回思到前郎的好處呢？愛管吳紫秋紡棉花的上海朋友們，等候着下文吧！</p>
<p>（編者按）吳素秋與王和霖的婚變情形，已如上述，頃悉他倆幸得友好從中調解，業於九月廿三日晚上成立和解字據，雙方言歸於好，這倒是一個出人意表的喜訊。盼望這對靑年藝人，從此夫唱婦隨，大家對戲劇運動，刻苦的研究一番，才是道理。</p>

<p>吳三桂因有御旨未敢怠慢，即日將所部重行編排一番，分作三軍，而留柴央率兵二萬，留駐寗遠。大兵開拔入關時，指定夜間開拔，分批而行，以防滿洲偵知，而有什麼舉動。他令部下守備馬寶爲覺鋒，張蒼虬陳飛爲輔。許靖柳隱英却派在右軍白顯忠參將部下。在三月初旬，大軍移動入關。那時滿洲幼主新立，攝政王多爾袞總握政權，方在整頓內部，對於明朝一時尚無侵吞的野心。所以三桂入關，滿洲方面起初尚沒有接到情報，無何動作。然三桂大兵剛纔開豐潤縣，忽然晴天霹靂，突然而降，惡耗報到，李闖已攻被京帥，崇禎帝和內監王承恩自縊於萬歲山，以身殉國了。吳三桂得到這個不祥的消息，中心震悼，自恨大軍開拔得遲緩一些，以至不能保衛京師，而使賢主身殉社稷，挽救不及。且自己的愛姬圓圓也陷身在圍城之中，不知玉人可能卒保無恙？這是他懸懸於心的。這樣一來，他立刻徘徊不進，在礫州附近暫時駐紥。一面派出許多探子到京中去刺探消息，再定對付李闖之計。當然部下三軍一齊震動。（一八二）</p>

(Another dispatch) Strong Chinese forces swept through the rear of the Japanese army on both sides of the Miluo River yesterday, making progress. The Japanese army's route of return is gradually being cut off by the Chinese army.

<p>Government Spokesperson Reports on the Battle Situation to Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese government spokesperson told newspaper reporters this afternoon that Changsha is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is determined to defend the city at all costs. Regarding the future of Changsha, the Chinese side believes it is very hopeful. Chongqing was still able to communicate with Changsha by telephone this morning. The city is no longer an important food and transportation center because the Chinese side has made all necessary preparations to cope with the Japanese offensive. All highways and railways within a 50-mile radius of the city have been systematically destroyed. Currently, the Japanese army closest to Changsha is still eight miles from the city. Changsha reported at 9 AM this morning that the situation has not changed. The Japanese army is still holding the Laotang River, which they reached on September 27th. The Japanese side claims to have entered Changsha on the evening of September 27th, stating that hundreds of Japanese paratroopers arrived in the northern suburbs at that time. However, according to a telephone call from Changsha on the evening of September 28th, all Japanese troops have been cleared. After crossing the Miluo River, the Japanese army advanced southward in four routes. The main force on the left flank advanced along the main highway northeast of Changsha, while the right flank attacked along the Yuehan Railway, reaching the Laotang River north of Changsha and then being unable to continue their advance. At the same time, the Chinese army operating behind the Japanese lines has begun to encircle them from the east, west, and north. The eastern route advanced westward along the main highway, the western route attacked the railway line, and the northern route moved south from the Miluo River. As a result, 100,000 Japanese troops along the north bank of the Laotang River were surrounded. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)</p>

The Chinese army operating north of the Miluo River has cut off the Japanese army's rear transportation lines for 60 li. Another powerful Chinese force is intensifying its westward advance in the Pingjiang-Liuyang area. The Chinese army surrounding Changsha is not only numerous but also exceptionally brave. Even if the Japanese army eventually sets foot in Changsha, it will not be able to hold it because it will be surrounded by a powerful Chinese army. (Havas dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Post-War World Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Considering that the thoughts and lives of modern humans are turbulent and dazzling, the speed of their evolution is truly like lightning too fast to cover one's ears, and there are things that are incredible. Today, the diligent and self-improving efforts of the nations are aimed at seeking a way for humans to conquer nature and contribute all their gains to humanity, so as to enhance the common enjoyment of welfare as the individual or collective way of life. This kind of issues such as the construction of the future world or the transformation of human civilization, regardless of whether there is an interruption of war, are brewing into the central issue of the world at this stage in a subtle way, and it has long been recognized by philosophers, and we should not be afraid of rhetoric and have repeatedly elaborated on it.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held talks on the ship. Most of the content is kept secret, but its scope is broad. And it is undoubtedly aimed at resolving various issues with the lives of people around the world as the destination. Therefore, the future trend of human life after the war will inevitably be found in this "Atlantic Charter of Human Rights".</p>
<p>Recently, a scientific conference is being held in London, and its purpose is the post-war world construction, first of all, how to maintain the lives of the people in the invaded countries as a prerequisite, as well as all adjustments in the mode of production and the economic system. It can be seen that the world construction in the future will focus on the transformation of the entire economic structure. The trend of the major revolution in economic life has become clear.</p>
<p>The British representative explained that the post-war production mechanism is incomplete, and it is impossible to restore the old view in a short period of time. Therefore, some countries must be responsible for supplying other ethnic groups, just as the countries in the Democratic Front must rely on the United States to supply armaments. But the issues involved in production methods and transaction policies are profound. For other countries to produce, how will international income and expenditure be settled? Where will the profits come from? What are the standards for trading procedures? There is no conclusion, and we must discuss it at length. Some say that we can follow the path of the past to find a solution, but the result may be to repeat the mistakes after the First World War. Since 1918, the major powers have been exhausted in their efforts to restore the old system, and finally failed and promoted the outbreak of the Second World War. Therefore, the system must be thoroughly transformed, and there is no room for dispute, but how to transform it depends on the joint research and solutions of people from all countries.</p>
<p>What can be predicted in the theory is that in the future, issues such as production, consumption, transaction, and distribution will never be left to the free will of various countries as in the past. The mutual restraint and mutual control between countries will inevitably intensify. If a country with low production efficiency is bound to be oppressed by a country with high production efficiency, so as to give up this production, it is expected. If we want to manufacture cars, but due to the inefficiency of others, we must give up this kind of production attempt, then the future is self-evident. This is the case with production, and so is consumption. Where can we achieve the goal of common enjoyment? This is really worth discussing.</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with modern problems point out that there will be a gold pound group, a mark group, a dollar group, a Soviet group, and a Japanese gold group after the war, each delineating its sphere of influence and accommodating small ethnic groups. In a large range, we will seek to realize a conditional free trade system, and all weak ethnic areas will be reduced to dumping tails or material supply places.</p>
<p>Although it is a recognized argument that the economic system must be reformed in the future, the extent and method of its transformation depends on the evolution of the war and the determination of mankind. Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky's speech can be described as a needle in the eye. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's experience of reform over the past 20 years due to the defects of the private economic system is more than enough. Now, to melt the world's economic institutions into one furnace, its responsibility is far greater and more difficult than the revolution in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now clarify our position and expectations. Our national customs are honest and do not compete with the world, which is well known in the world. In recent years, due to the internal and external troubles, although there have been no major achievements in science to contribute to mankind, it is also our contribution to preserve the great oriental culture and material resources for thousands of years and to supply the needs of friendly countries. We are fighting for sovereignty, and we must fight for national survival. We will make our best efforts to cooperate with the people of friendly countries to seek the happiness of the entire human race, but our free and independent living conditions must be complete and have the support of friendly countries. At the beginning of this world construction discussion, I hope to tell the participants this. And encourage the people of the country!</p>

<p>Japanese Troops in Shantou Will Not Withdraw</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources here, detachments from the Japanese 28th, 104th, and 108th Divisions, who participated in the Fujian Province battles, are now returning to Guangdong Province and are stationed in Shantou, Kowloon, Guangzhou, and Zhongshan County. Because the Japanese troops are being transferred back to Guangdong Province, the Japanese troops in Shantou and other coastal areas are unlikely to withdraw. In the past two weeks, the Japanese defense forces stationed in Guangdong Province, seeing that the Japanese troops in Fujian Province are about to return, have been transferred to Chengkang (transliteration), Taiping Tang, and other northern fortresses to defend Guangdong and prevent guerrilla attacks. Because the tense situation between Vietnam and Thailand has eased, the Japanese warships patrolling the South China Sea are returning north. Three Japanese fleets, including light cruisers, destroyers, troop transports, and minesweepers, can be seen offshore of Shantou this week. These ships are currently returning to Taiwan for repairs. There are forty Japanese naval aircraft parked on the Japanese airfields in Shantou and Nan'ao. These aircraft bombed the Fujian-Guangdong border last week. Other Japanese aircraft are conducting daily reconnaissance flights over the skies of Pinghe, Shao'an, Yunxiao, and Fengshun, because large groups of guerrillas are gathering in the above-mentioned areas. Other Chinese guerrillas are attacking Japanese troops in the Jiangmen Xinhui area, north of Shenzhen, along the Hong Kong-Guangdong Road. It is said that the Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties in August. (International News Agency dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Exercises Have Ended, Involving Over 500,000 Personnel</h3>

He praised the mobile units and flat-trajectory artillery units.</p>
<h3>Professor Pan Chaoying of the United States Talks About the Recent Situation of U.S. Aid to China, Sympathizing with China's War Effort and Providing Assistance, Overseas Chinese Donations are Particularly Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Dr. Pan Chaoying, former professor at Princeton University in the United States, left the United States in August and arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong a few days ago. When interviewed by reporters about the recent situation of U.S. aid to China, he said that the United States has traditionally been friendly to China and has expressed sympathy for our resistance to Japan since the beginning. However, because there is no immediate conflict of interest, and some people doubt the sustainability of our resistance to Japan, the initial assistance was only spiritual. After the Battle of Shanghai, the heroic fighting of our army became clear, and from doubt it turned into admiration. After the Panay incident, the United States was very angry, and the activities of our national diplomatic envoys in the United States have also been effective. The resistance to Japan has been sustained, which has made the people of that country turn from admiration to material assistance. Among them, Catholics account for one-sixth of the U.S. population, and their donations are very large. Catholics in various places are enthusiastically promoting it. As for the overseas Chinese, the situation is very enthusiastic. In small ports with fewer overseas Chinese, the results of their donations often exceed expectations. The average amount of donations is five yuan per person per month, and whole numbers are not counted. Situ Meitang and Ruan Benwan, leaders of the overseas Chinese in eastern America, have lived overseas for 50 years and are both over 60 years old. Because of the heroic fighting of their motherland, they said that they must return to the country to witness the accompanying capital of the holy war and pay tribute to the leader who is respected by people at home and abroad, so as to have no regrets. They have now put everything aside and will soon set off. Situ and Ruan are highly respected among the overseas Chinese in eastern America and can represent the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for their motherland. As for the U.S.-Japan talks, Pan said that the United States' main goal at present is to help Britain and the Soviet Union defeat Hitler, so it is not impossible to make partial adjustments to the relationship with Japan, but it will never sacrifice our country to accommodate Japan, because there are fundamental factors between the United States and Japan that cannot be resolved. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech to the Associated Press reporter, he happened to be in Hong Kong. When he asked his British and American friends, they all said that this statement was very (timely) and admired it. International relations are complicated, diplomatic operations are constantly changing, and all of them take their own national interests as the premise. This is a matter of course, but sometimes, because of the righteous and firm proposition, the precarious situation can be slightly saved. Pan, in addition to teaching at the university, has traveled all over the United States and Canada to appeal for aid for the resistance against Japan. He is very accomplished. This time, he plans to introduce the situation of the country's resistance against Japan in friendly countries at any time, so as to fulfill his national duty. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<h3>Nepal Recruits Soldiers to Help Britain Fight</h3>
<p>Kathmandu, Nepal, Reuters, 29th: Nepalese Prime Minister Rana said in a speech yesterday that the armies of those whose purposes are upright will be a hundred times stronger, so those who are determined to fight for selfless purposes, such as Britain, will surely win the final victory. There is no doubt that Britain has always served small and fallen countries, holding high the banner of victory, using justice to control force, using morality to suppress sin, and using truth and justice to defeat lies and treachery, standing firm and holding the only hope of saving all countries now groaning under heavy burdens from the waters and fire. Nepal follows Britain and will never change. It is now planned to recruit 20,000 soldiers and reorganize 20 battalions of troops to help Britain fight. The preparations are progressing satisfactorily.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Craig Extends Departure from Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: It was rumored that Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had taken leave and departed for the United States. This news is inaccurate. According to reliable sources at Reuters, while the Ambassador has long considered taking a vacation and traveling to the United States and England, planning to depart on the Anhwei, which is carrying British expatriates leaving Japan, he has temporarily canceled his plans because the embassy counselor, Mr. Boswall, has not yet recovered from his illness. The Ambassador will overcome difficulties and postpone his departure. It is said that this trip has no political overtones. According to Japanese news agencies, the Ambassador had reserved a seat on the express train to Kobe but canceled it a few hours before departure. An embassy spokesman said that the Ambassador's departure had been indefinitely postponed because the situation at the embassy was inconvenient for him to leave. The spokesman also denied that the Ambassador's departure from Japan had any intention of "retaliating" for the return of the Japanese Ambassador to England.</p>

<h3>Red Army of Leningrad Counterattacks, Breaks Through Three German Defense Lines; Two Romanian Brigades Annihilated on Southern Front; Soviet Forces Capture Five Towns on Northwest Front</h3>
<p>TASS, Battlefield Report, 29th: The strength of the Leningrad garrison is growing daily. On several lines, the Red Army has repeatedly launched counterattacks. At 5:00 AM on the 26th, the Red Army launched a counterattack against the German positions, which had three strong defensive lines. It first occupied the enemy's first line of defense, and then successively broke through the enemy's second and third lines of defense. Heavy fighting continued from morning to dusk. As a result, all three enemy defensive lines were occupied by our forces. During the night, the enemy attempted a counterattack but failed, suffering extremely heavy losses. The Red Army led by General Botleyev has annihilated 700 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>TASS, Northwest Front, 29th: The Red Army's anti-aircraft artillery has been extremely effective near Leningrad. Recently, the anti-aircraft artillery unit shot down 49 enemy planes. The fighting was very fierce at the time, and enemy planes could not break through into Leningrad.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 29th: The Information Bureau announced in its war report this morning that our forces fought the enemy on all fronts last night. The Romanian Second and Fourth Brigades on the southern front have been annihilated by our forces.</p>
<p>United Press of America, Moscow, 29th: The positions of the Soviet Red Army in the Leningrad area seemed to have advanced yesterday. The area has been under constant pressure from the German forces for more than a month. News from the front indicates that not only has the Soviet resistance been strengthened, but the strength of the counterattack has also increased. Soviet forces broke through multiple points of the German trenches, each 150 meters apart, outside the suburbs, and seized these well-defended positions. According to the "Red Star" newspaper, the German forces seem to have made no progress. After the Soviet forces launched a counterattack towards Staraya Russa, 125 miles south of Leningrad, they strongly broke through the German fortified positions and successively captured five towns with a rapid sweeping posture. It is said that fierce fighting is still continuing in that area. According to information from Ilinka, the German forces concentrated large armies there at the end of the week, which reduced the strength of the neighboring strongholds along the Desna River. According to reports, the German forces have built three rings of fortress-like battlefields on the Desna front. According to reports, Soviet infantry, with the help of artillery, launched an attack on the German forces and forcibly crossed the river, after which they occupied the first line of defense. "Izvestia" reported that after Marshal Timoshenko occupied Ilinka, he expanded the offensive to the neighboring areas of the Esna River and continued to capture ten villages. The Soviets and Germans immediately built new positions within the armed positions previously built by the Germans along the coast.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th: A recent Soviet communique stated that no fewer than 98 German planes were destroyed last Friday, and 36 Soviet planes were also lost. On September 27, two German reconnaissance planes were shot down over Moscow. On the 28th, two German bombers were shot down. The Soviet Northern Fleet sank one enemy transport ship of 8,000 tons and one of 4,000 tons. The coastal artillery and Soviet ships of the Baltic Fleet sank one enemy cruiser and one destroyer each, and heavily damaged two other enemy destroyers. In the Black Sea, one enemy oil tanker of 2,000 tons was also sunk. The announcements regarding land battles were as simple as usual, merely stating, "On September 28, our forces engaged the enemy along the entire front."</p>
<p>United Press of America, London, 29th: Reliable military sources here stated yesterday that the fact that the German forces have not announced any new victories in Ukraine and Crimea proves that the war has turned in favor of the Soviet forces. Although fierce fighting continues in the Crimea, heavy and continuous rains have brought the German mechanized forces to a standstill. Yesterday, this station heard Berlin radio broadcasts reporting that the Red Army had launched many fierce counterattacks.</p>
<h3>German Side Reports That General Potapov Was Ordered to Be Executed by the Soviet Authorities</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: General Potapov, the commander of the Southern Front Army Group of the Soviet Army, was secretly shot by the secret police on the 23rd of this month in Stalingrad. According to Soviet prisoners of war east of the Dnieper River, General Potapov received an order of dismissal from Stalin on the 12th. General Timoshenko temporarily replaced General Potapov as the commander of the Southern Front Army Group. On the same day, the secret police sent a plane to transport General Potapov to Stalingrad. On the morning of the 23rd, Kruglov, a confidant of the Director of the Secret Police, briefly interrogated him. Then, at 11:30 AM, he was shot in the secret police prison. General Potapov was born 58 years ago in a poor Cossack farmer's family. At the age of 20, he became a cavalryman. In 1918, he joined the Bolshevik Party and participated in the civil war. In 1919, he was promoted to commander of the First Cavalry Army and helped defend Saritsani (i.e., Stalingrad). At that time, Stalin was the political commissar of Saritsani. In 1935, Potapov was promoted to general. In 1937, he served as the commander of the Moscow Military District and concurrently as the Deputy People's Commissar of Defense. His wife was a descendant of the Russian aristocracy and was shot in 1938. Recently, the Soviet army was annihilated by five armies in Kyiv. This is said to be the reason for the execution of General Potapov.</p>
<h3>Nazi Troops Advance into Kharkov, Attempt to Occupy the Donets Basin</h3>
<p>United Press of America, London, 29th: News today stated that the German attack on the isthmus to approach Crimea is showing signs of slowing down, and seems to have launched a fierce attack on Kharkov, still seeking to achieve its goal of reaching the Donets Basin. According to various reports, the "spearhead" of Nazi mechanized divisions and motorized infantry is engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet troops east of Poltava along the Kharkov railway line. The remnants of the Soviet troops trapped east of Kyiv are still fiercely resisting the Nazis. It is heard that General Potapov reorganized the communist troops in Kharkov after withdrawing from Kyiv in an attempt to prevent the German troops from invading Kharkov, because Kharkov is the largest industrial city in eastern Ukraine and the lock of the Donets Basin, and is the gateway to one of the main routes to the Caucasus. Currently, it is raining everywhere on the entire front. The activities of millions of soldiers and machines have entered the 100th day of the German-Soviet war. Both sides are making great efforts to fight one of the unprecedented wars in the world. The situation on the entire front is not very clear at present, but according to various reports, the Soviet army still maintains a dominant position on the central front. It is heard that the troops of Marshal Timoshenko have launched a new counterattack to relieve the crisis in Leningrad. The Leningrad area still seems to be unchanged, but it is heard that Marshal Voroshilov has launched a counterattack in Staraya Russa, 150 miles south of Leningrad. However, the German's great offensive seems to be concentrated on Kharkov, which guards the Caucasus oil fields. The Germans have not yet gained a foothold on the Crimean Peninsula, but the battle for the isthmus is still underway, because the isthmus is the main entrance to Crimea. British military experts said that they have no reliable news to prove that the German advance in the Sea of Azov is not a mistake. Some people believe that the Germans may be planning an attempt to enter Moscow, so that they can flank Timoshenko from Orel and Tula to achieve a record of achievement far exceeding the Battle of Kyiv.</p>
<h3>US-Japan Policies on the Far East Are Diametrically Opposed; Economic Warfare Exists in Fact; Danger of Shooting War Is Extremely High</h3>
<p>United Press of America, New York, 29th: The danger of a shooting war between the United States and Japan today is considered to be the greatest that the two Pacific nations have ever had since their relationship began. A bloody battle is inevitable, which is what everyone is speculating about. Many Americans in Washington and the Far East believe that in the near future, the possibility of our troops fighting in the Pacific is greater than in the Atlantic. But most impartial observers say that neither the United States nor Japan wants a shooting war. The actions of the leaders of both sides are extremely cautious at this time to avoid having to fight</p>
<p>Overt Action</p>
<p>This unprecedented situation has been caused by a long and complex series of events. These events can be summarized as follows: The Washington government is committed to stopping aggression around the world, resolving international disputes legally and peacefully, and maintaining the original state of affairs in East Asia. Japan is committed to uniting East Asian countries and eliminating Western imperialism, such as Britain's rule of Malaya, the Netherlands' rule of the East Indies, and foreign concessions in China. It also allows necessary raw materials, such as oil from the East Indies, to be freely obtained, and at least in theory, will gradually eliminate the white race's rule over millions of Asians. Washington lists Japan as an aggressor and cites the conflict between China and Japan in Manchuria and the undeclared war between Chinese and Japanese troops in mainland China to prove Japan's determination to seize what it wants by force. Tokyo does not recognize the responsibility for aggression and says that the outbreak of the Manchuria and China wars was due to China's violation of agreements and unlawful acts. According to Japan's view, Japan's establishment of its own scope of interests in East Asia with the Japanese Monroe Doctrine is as reasonable as the United States' self-recognition as the leader of the Manchurian Republic and the representative of American defense.</p>
<p>The Direct Conflict of US-Japan Policies</p>
<p>Seems to be Washington's announcement that it advocates maintaining the original state of affairs in East Asia. If Japan establishes an East Asian national group with Japan as its leader, the original state of affairs in East Asia will obviously not be preserved. Although the establishment of the East Asian national group has been opposed by Britain and the United States, it has made considerable progress. The "Manchukuo" has become a country with close alliance relations with Japan. Most of China's coastal areas and inland strongholds, such as Hankou and naval military strongholds in the South China Sea, such as Hainan Island, have been controlled by the Japanese army. And the Japanese army is based on the agreement concluded with France to control Vietnam. It is estimated that there are now 50,000 or more Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam, with tanks and aircraft as supplements. In southern Vietnam, Japan controls all the coral islands on the edge of the Spratly Islands, making Japan almost adjacent to the coast of the Philippines. Washington has also taken repeated actions to counter Japan's continued expansion. First, it also blamed Japan for its aggression in Manchuria, followed by a diplomatic announcement to cancel the basic treaties on Japanese-American relations, and to cooperate with China, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies to protect their interests in Southeast Asia by borrowing military supplies. In fact, economic severance with Japan and assistance to the Soviet Union, which the Japanese army has long regarded as an enemy. Economic warfare between Japan and the United States has been realized for several weeks, but the</p>
<p>diplomatic relations</p>
<p>Are still maintained. It is expected that it will be maintained until an open action breaks out. There are many possibilities for open action, including the following: Japan's implied threat to intercept other American ships carrying gasoline and other items to the Soviet Far East port of Vladivostok. Japan argues that the establishment of the American arms route to Vladivostok will strengthen the Soviet Union's Far East army fighting against Germany, Japan's ally, and will create military preparations that the Soviet Union may use to deal with Japan, or may make the Soviet Union lend part of its arms to China for continued warfare against Japan. If an American ship is intercepted by a Japanese warship, an explosive situation will occur within two weeks. The decision is the large-scale stationing of Japanese troops in Vietnam adjacent to Thailand. Thailand is what Britain and the United States want to protect, because Thailand controls the points where American supplies are transported into China via the famous Burma Road, which passes through British Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, and is under control. It is believed that if the Japanese army enters Thailand, Britain will fight Japan if it is determined to obtain American military assistance. Finally, it is manifested in the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the three powers that the Axis considers the backbone of the order. If President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill want to fulfill their promise to eliminate the threat of Hitler's military institutions, then this alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan must obviously be destroyed by Britain and the United States using pressure.

<h3>Turkish-German Economic Negotiations Proceed Smoothly; Reportedly to Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>Havas, Istanbul, 20th: Responsible persons here recently said that the economic negotiations between Turkey and Germany have been successfully concluded and a preliminary agreement has been reached. Once the German authorities finally approve it, it can be formally signed. Sir Krodius, the chief representative of the German economic delegation, is expected to visit the capital today, but this trip is purely private in nature, and he will take the opportunity to meet with the German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Mabon. As for the British Embassy, it does not attach importance to the results of this trip by the German economic representative. The German side only said that the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. It is said that trade between Turkey and Germany has been suspended since August 1939 for two years. After the establishment of the new Chamber of Commerce, the police will almost certainly be able to resume trade.</p>

<h3>Anti-German Activities Surge in the Occupied Territories of Czechoslovakia; Nazis Announce Martial Law in Six Places; Prime Minister Elias of Bohemia Arrested</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Prague, 29th: During the visit of Dr. Hácha, President of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the German Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, General Heydrich, announced that General Elias, Prime Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, had been arrested on charges of treason and would be tried by the People's Court. He also reported that a state of emergency had been declared in Prague, Brous, Mariachi, Ostrava, Kladno, and Olomouc because of recent anti-German activities in various places, which were launched by elements bought by the enemy.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 28th: The semi-official agency "Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur" recently issued a message stating that Heydrich, the German Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, and Frank, the leader of the National Socialist Storm Troopers, visited President Hácha today and immediately told him the reasons and motives for declaring martial law in places such as Xi Lagu. They also said that in recent days, some unwilling people have accepted subsidies from European enemies and are active everywhere, attempting to use propaganda methods to make the people of the two states oppose Germany. They deeply hope that all the people can clearly understand that they share the same fate as the people of European countries, and under no circumstances can they be used by Germany's enemies. Prime Minister Elias of the two protectorates has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rebel and will be tried by the People's Court. President Hácha replied in writing at 2:30 PM, stating that the government authorities are willing to cooperate in suppressing the rioters and appealed to the people to assist the government.</p>
<h3>Change of Nazi Protector; Iron-Fist Rule to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Because of the Czech people's passive resistance, secret sabotage, or open rebellion, one after another, like a tide, making it difficult to cope with, Neurath, the Nazi Protector of Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic, will transfer his post to Heydrich, the young leader of the Blackshirts, because he is 68 years old and his energy is not enough to cope with it. He is the deputy commander of the secret police. After taking office yesterday, he issued an order announcing the state of emergency in six places in the two protected provinces. Those who resist the Nazi regime will be punished immediately. London observers believe that this is a prelude to the indiscriminate detention of people in the Czech Republic and execution on the slightest suspicion. At the same time, there is a rumor that Dr. Duka, the Prime Minister of Slovakia appointed by the Nazis, was assassinated unsuccessfully, and that Iris, the Prime Minister of the Protectorate Government, was also detained for committing treason. There have been strikes in Czech military factories and textile factories from time to time. The military and police arrested trade union members and threatened to shoot them if they did not resume work, but the strikers said that if those arrested were shot, the workers would never enter the factory. Slogans of the V-word movement and slow work have been found in various towns in the Czech Republic. Recently, there have been repeated cases of machines being damaged for no reason, trains derailed, factory orders being wrong, and goods being delivered incorrectly.</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th: According to news received by Czechs here, the state of emergency declared in Bohemia and Moravia in the two provinces now stipulates that those who commit crimes will be tried by military courts. Once convicted, they will be executed and no appeal is allowed.</p>
<h3>First Death Sentence in Czech Territory; Six People Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: German radio said that the first death sentence issued by "European Executioner" Heydrich under the state of emergency in the Czech "Protectorate" has been carried out yesterday. A total of six people were executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: News of resistance to the Germans is coming from all over Europe. Yesterday, two planes collided in Slovakia, killing a total of five people. Paris newspapers reported that the Germans had executed 20 people in retaliation for a series of explosions on various railways. Guerrillas in Yugoslavia sank one German and one Italian ship each in the port of Dubrovnik, destroyed railway traffic, and attacked German and Italian troops, killing more than 200 soldiers and seizing rifles and bullets.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bern, 29th: The appointment of Heydrich as Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia to replace Neurath is seen here as evidence that resistance to German rule in the occupied countries is becoming increasingly strong. In this regard, newspapers reported that the number of people executed by the Germans in the French occupied areas is increasing, and guerrilla warfare in the Southern Territory is also becoming more active. Czechs and other Slavs are optimistic about the results of the Soviet resistance to German aggression and hate the Germans even more. According to the National Daily, the German appointment of Heydrich proves that occupying Bohemia and Moravia has recognized the need to implement an iron-fist regime in the two provinces. Heydrich ranks second in the secret police. He killed many people in the cleansing operation at the end of June 1934. The Germans are all afraid of him and consider him one of the most brutal Nazis.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Extremely Active in the Territories of Southern Romania and Norway</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: According to Moscow Radio, Raboviz, the leader of the Southern National Youth Party, claimed yesterday at the Anti-Fascist Youth Congress in Moscow that the Southern National guerrillas had destroyed 200 bridges, bombed 400 gunpowder depots, destroyed 17 trains, and killed nearly 10,000 fascists in two months. France's independent communications received news from Istanbul that although Kwisling in Southern National called on the people to lay down their arms and surrender to Germany, this generation made more patriots increase sabotage. The German side sent three new divisions into Southern National to carry out suppression, but bridges were still being bombed and railways were being excavated. Those who arrived in the Turkish territory from Southern National all said that the main railway between the capital of Southern National and Nis has now been destroyed, and railway traffic in Bosnia has also been suspended.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th: Recently, there have been repeated factory explosions and railway accidents in Romania. A German military train heading to the front a few days ago derailed, killing more than 100 fascists. From September 10 to 20, four German food depots in Craiova, Timisoara, and Oradea caught fire. Every day, trains carrying munitions are burned. In view of the increasing number of strikes and sabotage, Romanian newspapers have published an official order stating, "Those who engage in strikes will be shot on the spot."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Independent French communications reported from Oslo that a nitric acid factory in Telemark Province, Norway, "caught fire spontaneously" on Saturday. The factory's laboratory and valuable materials were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: The German News Agency said that the Sofia Court will begin hearing the cases of 35 spies on October 20. They were previously hired by Britain and Southern National and planned to launch a revolution in the territory of Southern National in the spring of this year.

<p>Reuter, Tehran, 29th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, arrived here by plane at 5 PM on the 27th to discuss the Caucasus defense and other matters with the Soviet authorities. In addition to discussing the joint defense of Iran and its major oil wells, he will also study the methods being prepared by the British staff to transport supplies to the Soviet Union. Several batches of Indian jute and cotton have already been delivered to the Soviet side. Currently, they are busy drafting a reorganization of the poorly managed Persian-Soviet railway system and establishing a large-scale road transportation company, so that supplies can be transported in large quantities and continuously. If it is necessary to meet with the Commander-in-Chief of the Caucasus region bordering the Soviet Union, he may fly to Tbilisi. He told reporters that according to the latest plan, this trip is unlikely to materialize. Five years ago, he visited the Soviet Union to attend army exercises. When he received reporters on the morning of the 29th, he said that he did not think it was necessary to establish a joint British-Soviet command, but plans for closer cooperation between the two armies are now being drafted. A reporter told him that some foreign radio commentators speculated that British troops would be transferred to the Caucasus. He replied that foreign radio commentators are not always correct and that he did not have time to study the problem of how to use Persian troops if Persian territory is attacked. He also said that he believes that the Soviet navy is still active along the Black Sea coast, and the Germans will inevitably advance around it. To eliminate this Soviet fleet, they must occupy all its bases or transfer the Italian navy to the Black Sea. If this is the case, the Italian navy will have to forcibly pass through the Dardanelles Strait or seek Turkey's consent to pass through, but Turkey has no intention of permitting this. He seems to be staying here for a day or two longer. He had a long discussion with Soviet General Novikov. The aircraft he came on was a large Douglas airliner, the first aircraft to land here since the incident. The time taken to fly from London to Tehran can be considered a new record under ? conditions. The British ambassador hosted a lunch and dinner to welcome him. He is expected to return to India either tomorrow or the day after. Before leaving, he may travel by car to Sultanabad and Hamadan to inspect British troops.</p>
<p>Reuter, Simla, 29th - It was officially announced here this afternoon that last Friday and Saturday, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, and General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, held an important meeting in Poona to discuss detailed cooperation methods between India and the Middle East regarding the anti-Axis front currently established from Syria through Iraq and Iran to the left flank of the Soviet army.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Taking Advantage of Expensive Mixed Yarns, Shuang Ma Factory Singles Were All Bought Up, Prices Raised to Over 1840 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending strong, and the price increases are very intense. This is because mixed and Japanese yarns are expensive, so the sales of Shuang Ma Factory singles have improved. As a result, the chips are gradually tightening and shrinking. Although the courage of short sellers is sharp, they have no way to deliver because the delivery chips are dry. In addition to the discount, swaps have to be offset. Therefore, Shuang Ma Factory single yarns, which have been held for many days, suddenly show signs of rising. The sales in Guangdong are still not weak, but not as prosperous as yesterday. The transaction of coarse yarn in Nanyang is continuous. Some people say that some telegrams have not yet been forwarded. The high price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn is 1831 yuan, and the low price is 1807 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was enthusiastic, and short positions were offset. Initially, it was made at 1840 yuan, rising to 1841 yuan. Then, profit-takers released, and it fell to 1826 yuan.

<h3>Mitterrand Raised to 800 Yuan, Nearly 10,000 Pieces of New Indian Cotton Arrived</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is still outstanding. Because the yarn market has risen, those who squeeze cotton are even more tight-lipped, so the market will not sell unless the price is high. Transactions have rebounded and become active. Those who have profited see their goals fulfilled, and there is no shortage of release to meet demand. The factory, in view of the unsatisfactory source, has to replenish it at any time to pay for the application.

<h3>Current Exchange Settlement Method: British and American Merchants Fully Support, Willing to Sacrifice to Ensure Thorough Effectiveness, Abide by National Laws and Cooperate with China, Foreign Exchange Allowed for Considerable Amounts of Tobacco, Gasoline, Cotton, Hemp, Sugar, etc.</h3>
<p>Several foreign business leaders and bankers, regarding the trial implementation of the Stabilization Fund's supply of foreign exchange, have encountered difficulties since its implementation. Therefore, they convened several meetings last week to study constructive measures and drafted a proposal. They sent representatives to Hong Kong with the proposal to be presented to the Stabilization Fund for reference and to explain everything in person. According to information obtained by the Dazhong News Agency reporter, the purpose of this action is to report on the past foreign exchange settlement situation and to present opinions on unsettled foreign exchange methods. British and American merchants are now firmly expressing that they will disregard all sacrifices and support the Chinese government's policy of managing foreign exchange, ensuring its thorough effectiveness. They would welcome it if the Stabilization Fund could send senior officials to be stationed in Shanghai on a regular basis.</p>
<p>American Merchants Express Sincere Cooperation</p>
<p>The reporter visited Mr. Havass, the secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, at the Fuzhou Road office yesterday morning. According to him, "He had heard that several well-known commercial firms and insurance companies did hold meetings last week to review foreign exchange issues, but the Chamber did not participate. The information he obtained was roughly similar to what was reported in the newspapers." Mr. Havass also stated that American merchants would certainly earnestly abide by U.S. government laws and, at the same time, cooperate closely with the Chinese side to protect the interests of American merchants.</p>
<p>Current Methods Still Considered Convenient</p>
<p>According to a senior official of the Chartered Bank, the first batch of applications from banks specially authorized to handle exchange business at the new exchange rate were sent to the Stabilization Fund on the 18th of last month. Since all banks were able to carefully handle matters in accordance with the Stabilization Fund's various regulations in advance, most were approved and few were rejected. Generally, it was either a full rejection or a full approval, with very few partial approvals. The applications were directly taken to Hong Kong by air transport. Since the Hong Kong conference revised the trial implementation methods for September, essential goods in Shanghai, such as tobacco, gasoline, cotton, hemp, and sugar, which had been listed as prohibited import items, were also given considerable amounts of foreign exchange. With the scope being large, it is still considered convenient for legitimate import trade. The same will be implemented next month, without the promulgation of new methods. However, as the activities of speculative merchants have been restricted or halted, there will naturally be criticism. The foreign banks that participated in this meeting included only HSBC, Chartered Bank, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank. With September fleeting and October approaching, each bank must conduct a general review, report to the Stabilization Fund, and submit opinions. The banks have accepted the advice of the British and American governments, understand the difficult times, and are willing to sacrifice, resolutely stopping black market transactions. Therefore, it is expected that any suggestions will be constructive, ensuring that the methods are strict and can achieve the political, diplomatic, and economic goals of the Chinese, American, and British governments.</p>
<p>Certain Issues Need Not Be Worried About</p>
<p>As for the outside world's belief that the current methods still have shortcomings, the responsible party's explanation is as follows: (1) From application to approval, due to transportation issues, a considerable amount of time is required. The Stabilization Fund is striving for speedy processing, and the claim of unnecessary delays is not factual. (2) When requesting the supply of foreign exchange, merchants must state the purpose and distribution in the application, and the bank must guarantee its accuracy. Therefore, the Stabilization Fund seems to have no other way to distinguish between legitimate merchants and hoarders and manipulators other than carefully reviewing the authenticity. (3) The foreign exchange settled is limited, and how to allocate it must be changed at any time depending on the actual situation. (4) As for the claim that merchants can apply for foreign exchange from fourteen banks at the same time, this is practically impossible. Only by applying for negotiation of documents with a certain bank can that bank apply on its behalf. Only after the application is approved can the negotiation of documents be handled. If there is any concealment, the Stabilization Fund can easily detect it, so there is no need to worry about this. (5) Regarding the stabilization of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, the Stabilization Fund has already sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to preside over everything. Naturally, foreign banks would welcome it if more senior officials could be sent to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Two Newspapers Denounce Profiteering Behavior</p>
<p>The Stabilization Fund's supply of low-priced foreign exchange to the Shanghai market has a deep and significant impact on Shanghai's economic life. The Continental Daily News published an article yesterday entitled "The Stabilization Fund and Monopoly and Hoarding," criticizing the actions of importers in this port and the Stabilization Fund's measures. It stated that due to the importers' pursuit of profit, the purpose of establishing the Stabilization Fund seems to have been ignored. It should be known that the primary task of stabilization is to wage an economic war against Japan and its Axis countries in the Shanghai market. A simple and easy method would be to completely refuse to supply foreign exchange to the Shanghai market, preventing it from flowing to unfriendly parties. However, the Chinese government and the Allied countries of Britain and the United States are unwilling to allow the economic life of Shanghai and other occupied areas to be manipulated by others. Unfortunately, most importers who enjoy preferential foreign exchange disregard the Stabilization Fund's objectives, take advantage of opportunities, seek only profit, and engage in monopoly and hoarding, just like unscrupulous merchants. According to a recent commentary published in the Millard's Review by foreign economic expert Aris, canned beef cost only US$5.50 per can before the freeze order was implemented, but now it costs US$8. However, in terms of the foreign exchange situation, this price should not have increased. He suggested that small-scale monopoly and non-hoarding should be immediately stipulated as conditions for granting low-priced foreign exchange, and the shortcomings in management methods should be urgently corrected to ensure that profiteering behavior that harms others for personal gain no longer exists, leaving a stain on Shanghai merchants.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Handle Similarly</p>
<p>Chinese banks in this port were unable to engage in foreign exchange business in principle because they did not have a special license issued by the U.S. government. Later, after the Four Banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China) intervened, they were still able to request a supply of foreign exchange on behalf of their customers, but they had to be submitted to the Stabilization Fund for approval through the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Chinese banks do not have a direct relationship with the Stabilization Fund, but are mediated by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. Currently, each Chinese bank has obtained various application forms from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, distributed them to relevant customers, filled them out according to the format, and then submitted them to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for submission to the Stabilization Fund for approval. The commission originally obtained by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is received by the Chinese banks. Therefore, Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank, Xingye Bank, Kenye Bank, Shiye Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, East Asia Bank, Zhongxing Bank, and Shanghai Bank can all start engaging in foreign exchange business, with all procedures being completely consistent.</p>

<h3>Two Companies Implement Oil Rationing System to Maintain Gasoline Reserves, Asiatic Petroleum Company to Implement Starting Tomorrow, Oil Tankers Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the oil ration card system in this port, gasoline purchases are limited to purchases with a certificate. According to a major oil company, the gasoline supply is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of October. It is also said that each oil company hopes that its customers can fully cooperate with it, and each company will try its best to maintain gasoline reserves so as to avoid taking stricter restrictions again. Regarding the distribution certificate system, Mobil and Texaco have implemented it yesterday, while Asiatic Petroleum Company will implement it starting tomorrow. As for whether the implementation of the distribution certificate system will lead to a reduction in public buses in the city, there is no confirmed news yet. Some car owners told reporters that they will reduce the number of rides to the minimum in the future in order to cooperate with the oil companies. Regarding the arrival of oil tankers in Shanghai by the end of next month, according to shipping industry sources, each large oil tanker arriving in Shanghai can provide the city with enough gasoline for six months.</p>
<h3>USS Henderson About to Depart, Painted with Wartime Colors</h3>
<p>Hundred Marines Return Home, About Thirty Replacement Soldiers</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy transport ship USS Henderson will depart Shanghai for the United States in a few days. One hundred soldiers from the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will return home on this ship. At that time, the number of U.S. troops stationed in Shanghai will decrease slightly, as it is heard that only about thirty U.S. replacement soldiers were brought to Shanghai by the USS Henderson. According to reports, the USS Henderson sailed from North China and arrived in Shanghai for a short stop yesterday morning (the 29th). The ship was previously painted light gray and has now been changed to a blue-black camouflage color. Moored at the U.S. Navy pontoon on the Yangjingbang, it presents an unusual sight.</p>

<h3>President Pierce Ship Returns to Hong Kong, Reason Not Announced, President Line Does Not Release Passenger List According to New Order</h3>
<p>The U.S. mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai the night before last and was docked at pontoons 12 and 13, as noted in previous reports. It is now learned that the mail ship departed Shanghai at dawn this morning and is still sailing to Hong Kong, and then directly from Hong Kong to Xiangshan before returning to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Reason for Re-routing Kept Secret</p>
<p>As for the reason why the ship is sailing to Hong Kong and then back to the United States, the company is keeping it secret. However, few passengers from Southeast Asia took the ship to Shanghai, and there are not many passengers returning to the United States from Southeast Asia. More than one hundred people from Shanghai boarded the ship to go to the United States.</p>
<p>Passenger Names Refused to Be Disclosed</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that several Shanghai residents arrived in Shanghai on the President Pierce mail ship from Manila, but their names are unknown because the American President Lines refused to disclose the names of any passengers in accordance with the new order. Their secrecy is as tight as guarding military secrets. It is heard that the company will no longer publish passenger lists for President Line ships, whether incoming or outgoing.</p>
<h3>Golden Prince Ship Released and Sails to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The British ship Golden Prince was previously detained and inspected for nearly two weeks before departure because it was discovered by the Japanese that it was loading a large batch of gauze and miscellaneous goods in Shanghai, intending to sail to Wenzhou. The goods were confiscated, all seized by the Japanese, as reported earlier. It is now learned that the ship was released after the goods were seized, and then repeated the customs clearance last Saturday, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong that evening.</p>
<h3>French Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Tomorrow and Substitute Vouchers Issued</h3>
<p>The French Water and Electricity Tram and Bus Public Transportation Company has recently announced another fare increase, which will be implemented starting tomorrow. The fees for electric lights, motor electricity, tap water, etc., have already been published in newspapers a few days ago, but the fare increase for vehicles was not specified at that time. It is heard that the general idea is to increase the tram fare by 1.3 cents per stop for first class and 2 cents for second class. The bus fare increase is said to be 2 to 4 cents per stop. In order to reduce trouble and prevent a shortage of change, the company has imitated the British bus company and specially printed a pink thick paper one-cent voucher for circulation on various vehicles. One side is printed with "Shanghai French Tram Company", followed by a number, and then "This ticket is worth one cent and can be used on all vehicles of this company. This ticket can be used until noon on December 31, 1941." The reverse side is in French. Because the fares are all odd numbers, a very large number of vouchers have been issued. Starting tomorrow (October 1), the company's trams and buses will implement the new prices.</p>
<h3>Duff Cooper Has No Intention of Visiting Shanghai</h3>

<h3>After the Implementation of the Embargo, Domestic Goods Sales to Southeast Asia Increase, Orders Arrive by Mail and Telegraph, Urging Speedy Delivery</h3>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 33 on the 24th of this month, stating that starting from that day, all Shanghai goods are prohibited from being transported to the free areas of our country, causing panic and market fluctuations. Prices of various goods have seen both rises and falls, with everyone believing that Shanghai goods will no longer be able to be transshipped to other ports for sale. After it was confirmed that Hong Kong, Yangon, Manila, and other places were not included in the prohibition, people's hearts began to stabilize. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited a major domestic goods merchant yesterday in order to understand whether the sales of domestic goods to Southeast Asia had been affected. The merchant said that all the exquisite products of major domestic goods factories in the city are still selling well in various territories of Southeast Asia and have not been affected in any way. Furthermore, recently, orders from overseas Chinese in various territories of Southeast Asia have been arriving frequently by mail and telegraph. The goods ordered in the mails and telegraphs are mostly silk fabrics, embroideries, raincoats, enamelware, knitwear, underwear, ties, electric bulbs, glassware, and locally made appliances. The goods are needed urgently. In addition to increasing production to meet the urgent needs of the area, domestic goods factories in the city are striving to improve quality and deliver goods on time to increase credibility. At the same time, they are also being careful with packaging to avoid damage from moisture during transportation. Therefore, the exquisite domestic goods produced by the city's factories are selling even more briskly.</p>

<h3>Woodhead Denies Printing Anti-British Leaflets, Claiming Someone Impersonated Him</h3>
<p>British commentator Woodhead recently wrote to the North China Daily News, stating that a friend told him that he recently received an anti-British leaflet entitled "The Greatest Decline in History" and attached a business card printed with the words "Presented by Woodhead." The content imitated the leaflet issued a few months ago related to the automatic donation to the war fund, entitled "The Greatest Crusade," which was first discussed in Gan Wei Lu's Nazi magazine "New China Voice." After reading it, I couldn't help but feel a little surprised. It goes without saying that the business card is a fake, and Gan Wei Lu has impersonated my business card to cover up his propaganda more than once. There is no way to remedy this kind of person except to announce it. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper, please publish it to expose this impersonation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Zhuji to Resume Remittances Within the Week</h3>

The bureau has now sent letters to the post offices in Shaoxing, Ningbo, Zhuji, and other places, planning to resume the development of remittance drafts in the region within the week, and to negotiate the amount allowed for each person to remit each day, as well as the amount of supplementary water fees and remittance fees per yuan.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Collection of Paintings by Ma Mengrong</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>It has been ten years since my deceased friend, Mr. Ma Mengrong, returned to the Dao Mountain. The Xiling Seal Society has collected his posthumous works and is publishing them in photographic form, asking me to write a preface. I recall that fifteen or sixteen years ago, I and Mengrong often visited each other, creating paintings and discussing art, often until dawn. Mengrong was capable of everything in painting, especially excelling in flowers, birds, insects, and fish. He once said that the flowers, birds, insects, and fish in the world, in all their various forms and colors, each have their natural beauty. When taking them into painting, the brush and ink techniques must have considerable cultivation, and the forms and colors must not deviate from their authenticity. Therefore, his works emphasize both form and color, emphasizing form and color to grasp the truth of nature, and emphasizing brush and ink to express the wonders of painting. He does not imitate the ancients, does not follow the trends, does not fabricate things to proclaim his loftiness, and does not engage in clever flattery to lose his nature. Every blade of grass and feather is presented with simplicity and innocence. Examining the style of flower and bird painting in our country, since Xu Huang of the Five Dynasties, the extreme of meticulousness is to admire realism, and the extreme of realism is to admire meticulousness. Meticulousness emphasizes form and color, and its drawbacks are that it is delicate, rigid, and lacks vitality. Realism emphasizes brush and ink, and its drawbacks are that it is strange, rough, and lacks physical principles. Taking the Qing Dynasty as an example, Nantian Wang'an and Xinluo Futang were each masters of their time. Of those who followed Nantian Wang'an, how many did not suffer from being delicate and rigid? Of those who learned from Xinluo Futang, how many did not die from being strange and rough? Mengrong rose up to correct this, emphasizing form and color, and also emphasizing brush and ink. He had the learning and the skills, truly a hero of his generation. His contribution to the flower and bird painting school in our country, establishing a unique method between meticulousness and realism, can be enshrined and sacrificed in a different hall from Nantian and Xinluo. Therefore, Mengrong's death is truly a great loss to the art world of our country. However, while Mengrong was alive, he worked diligently on painting, and his posthumous works are still widely circulated. Those who followed him are almost all over the country. Is there no one to promote and carry it forward? Moreover, he has a brother like Gongyu, who is famous in this era for his epigraphy, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. His son and daughter are also able to carry on the family learning. With successors emerging, Mengrong is truly immortal.</p>

<h3>Dr. Shen Yougan Lectures on "Training of Thinking" (Continued)</h3>
<p>3. Analysis and Research on the Thinking Process: The process of thinking is very difficult. There are only two methods in psychology: 1. Objective method; 2. Subjective method. The objective method is too subtle, and the tools used are inconsistent, making it impossible for people to observe. Moreover, language and thinking are not the same. Dumb people can also think. If electric current is used to test the thinking dynamics in the brain, there will be no results. Subjective is based on experience and other fantasies, so neither of these two methods has results. Dewey's five-step method is more applicable: First, there must be doubts to arouse thinking; second, analyze its motives; third, make assumptions; fourth, deduce; fifth, verify that it is in line with reality. If the first assumption is found to be incorrect, it is overturned and another assumption is made, so it returns to the third step and re-deduces. More complicated problems can be fully applied, and some assumptions are very obvious and do not need to be verified, then the fourth and fifth steps can be omitted, or it can start from the third step. This is a general method for simple problems. Now let's analyze it further: A (Doubts) Thinking must have motivation, so we must first train the ability to discover problems. There are three motivations: 1. Practical difficulties. This is what we are more familiar with. If the problem is too far away, it will be difficult to solve; 2. Theoretical problems, such as: metals are heavier than water, but small needles can float on the surface of the water. So researchers become suspicious and problems arise; The third type is maintaining face. Most people want to save face. If things fail, they become suspicious of the tools, thinking that the tools harmed them. This kind of suspicious situation is very ridiculous. This kind of thinking is beneficial. The degree of doubt is related to the strength of the motivation. Insignificant difficulties are not enough to arouse thinking, and excessive difficulties can also cause emotional panic and reduce the hope of solving. So the problem should not be too difficult or too easy when training; B (Analysis) The success or failure of analyzing the problem depends on familiarity with the problem. If you are not familiar with the problem, it will be difficult to analyze. Therefore, effective thinking relies on broad and correct knowledge. Acquiring knowledge is also training thinking. However, the knowledge of the current generation is very complex. Experts know a lot about their own industry, but others are the same as ordinary people. Therefore, the goal of education should be both broad and specialized, that is, we should know something about everything, and we should know everything about some things. We must be humble when training, and do not pretend to be an expert; C (Assumption) Assumption is the central link of thinking. Without assumption, there is no way to observe facts. Sometimes there are too many things, and we cannot record everything we hear. We must choose to make assumptions. However, it should not be absurd and unfounded, and not in line with scientific laws. It must be possible to infer facts based on it. However, laws can also be overturned. Many laws were popular in the past but have now been overturned. For example, the theory of relativity is contradictory to Newton's rationalism, and now the theory of relativity has won. Therefore, the initial assumption can be bold about everything, and be careful when publishing. If you are careless, you will become a joke; D (Deduction) Deduction is the most certain step and also the step that is most prone to errors. The most common errors are: 1. The difference between sufficiency and necessity, that is, one condition cannot be regarded as the entire basis; 2. The difference between "is" and "equals", that is, the difference between conceptual things and units; 3. Emphasizing that the conclusion is in line with the facts, regardless of whether the deduction is effective or not. Because deduction needs to be developed, it will be ineffective if you pay attention to intuition; 4. The shortcomings of inaccuracies in ordinary writing cause errors in deduction, such as writing "healthy and beautiful youth" and mistakenly thinking that the father is healthy and beautiful, or "male and female youth" and mistakenly thinking that it is either male or female, etc.; E (Verification) If the result of reasoning is different from the proof, there is still room for overturning. Therefore, observation should pay attention to objective facts to be reliable. If it is only based on subjective and does not conform to the facts, it is unreliable. If a small number of samples are taken to represent general facts when observing, it is dangerous. Training verification must be precise, and those that meet or do not meet the assumptions should be collected together. Do not be固敎成見 (stubbornly stick to preconceived ideas). Training in attitude and aspect is to raise problems in peaceful things, take bold assumptions on the opposite side, and verify them from the statistics of facts, so as to reach a new stage of thinking.

<h3>Third Line Strategy</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>There are often two ways of looking at things in the world. Hitler's eastward and westward conquests, plundering all of Europe, were certainly a sign of his dominance, but at the same time, he also made the people of all the invaded countries in Europe his enemies. This may be what is called "every advantage has its disadvantages."</p>
<p>After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, commentators said that Hitler had three fronts at the same time: the Soviet Union in the east, Britain in the west, and the people in the occupied areas and the disgruntled people in his own country in the abdomen. It is still unknown which side will win the victory on the eastern and western fronts, but commentators mostly believe that Hitler's failure will mostly be on the third front.</p>
<p>However, Hitler was not blind to this so-called third front. He also had his own special strategies for the dissatisfaction of his own people and the resentment of the people in the occupied areas. The former was to use concealment and deception, and the latter was to use oppression and killing.</p>
<p>According to the Manchester Guide, due to the lack of food in Germany, it has banned magicians across the country from performing magic tricks related to food, such as "egg disappearance," "rabbit production in the hat," and "pigeon production in an empty bag," to avoid viewers drooling after watching them.</p>
<p>This is certainly a clever strategy, but it is also a question of how long this strategy can be implemented.</p>
<p>Human Nature</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of American Army Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>After the American army implemented the compulsory conscription system, it obtained a total of 669,500 new recruits. These new recruits were used to living a free life in peacetime. Once they arrived in the army, they could not get used to the disciplined life, and "depression" inevitably occurred. In addition to depression, they expressed their opinions in writing and made them public.</p>
<p>Each new American army unit publishes its own newspapers and periodicals, in which each soldier is free to express his opinions and express his feelings. Since this spring, the production of these newspapers has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, even more lively than the publications published when they participated in the European War for the first time. Some of these military newspapers are sold publicly, and some are distributed free of charge.</p>
<p>The content and style of the army publications are very similar to those published during the First European War. In other words, they are all about love affairs and related works. When soldiers write, they like to criticize their superiors mercilessly. This style is the same as it was twenty-five years ago. In journalistic terms, it is not uncommon for soldiers to offend their superiors, and it is a miracle for superiors to scold their soldiers.</p>
<p>There are a total of 202 such newspapers for warriors to vent their thoughts, most of which are published every three days. Among them, the most popular and best-selling is the "Panama Coastal Artillery News," which is published in the Quarry Hill Barracks in the Canal Zone. The main writer is a sergeant named "Old Master Taust". The content of the newspaper is full of enthusiasm, and readers are all over the country and abroad. There is also a kind called "Camp Bag", which is issued by the garrison in the Boston Military Station. It is rich in quality, and no other newspaper can compare with it. The entire newspaper has 50 pages the size of a book and has a color cover. It is magnificent and beautiful, and the content is mostly lower-class music. But it is very humorous, happy but not obscene, and teasing but not abusive. For example, the following style is used when revealing people's privacy: "Sergeant, why do you monopolize a certain girl's lunch dance? Let others share a cup of sunflower! Including us!..." "Corporal Peir Quwood has a new crush, also a cunning little thing..." "Why do Sergeant Green's two female companions always come to dance?"</p>
<p>Soldiers' newspapers are a reflection of their lives. For example, during the First European War, the army implemented a system of rationing food according to the number of people, and the soldiers complained a lot. This situation is no longer found now.</p>
<p>However, scandalous news and low-level tastes are not the whole picture of army newspapers. Even the most entertaining military newspaper editors must devote a lot of space to publishing news about army actions, army exercises, and new army equipment, as well as publishing the words and deeds of their superiors and sports competitions. Each newspaper has a special column for military recruiting officers to report news.</p>
<p>There are also a few poets scattered in the army, and their works are sometimes melancholy and sometimes mysterious in conception, but they are mostly light-hearted and value rhyme. The beginning is often:</p>
<p>Say goodbye to my sweetheart New England,</p>
<p>See a tear in her eyes,……</p>
<p>At the same time, there are also many artists in the army who draw wonderful cartoons and publish them in the newspapers. Some ridicule someone for putting a large vegetable fork on the muzzle of the gun to replace the bayonet, while others directly depict someone being tied with the words "left" and "right" on their feet by their superiors to distinguish directions. These newspapers are all checked by the intelligence officer before publication. If they do not leak military secrets or commit serious errors, they can be released.</p>
<p>In short, American army newspapers are full of jokes, not elegant, but ultimately educational. These newspapers are sent to the hometowns of the soldiers, winning a smile from their parents, elders, friends, and relatives, which can also save the trouble of writing letters home.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Burning Pen</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>When war breaks out, in addition to the victory or defeat on the battlefield, the authorities of the participating countries must also prevent enemy espionage and sabotage. During the First European War, some important scientists manufactured a kind of incendiary bomb that resembled a fountain pen in order to carry out sabotage. Although this incendiary bomb was small in appearance, it had extremely strong burning power, and the heat of its flames could penetrate steel plates, causing great losses to ships and goods sailing from the United States to Europe. Amidst the active American aid to China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the American military authorities paid extreme attention to this "burning pen" to prevent sabotage by unruly people.</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12. Unexpected Trouble</p>
<p>"There's evidence for this! The county police station knows about it!" Autumn Begonia said, sounding very confident. "Because my daughter is a student at the county middle school, and she was abducted by someone named Shang. The principal of the school, Principal Fang, immediately reported it to the police station. Later, the police station even brought in one of Shang's friends for questioning three times. If you don't believe me, you can ask today!"</p>
<p>This was something the patrol officer had not expected! He could swear to heaven that, no matter what, he would never have thought that the daughter of a farmer, dressed in old clothes and from a family in decline, would go to the county middle school.</p>
<p>"So, there's such a thing," he thought. The county middle school was, after all, an institution, and besides, the police station already had a case. If he continued to threaten Autumn Begonia, as Chief Li had instructed, he would be very out of touch. Therefore, his attitude immediately became gentler.</p>
<p>"They lost a son and just randomly try to put the blame on someone. My daughter was clearly abducted to Beiping by his brother-in-law! Does he pretend not to know? If you don't believe me, you can ask him yourself right now!" Autumn Begonia continued angrily.</p>
<p>"My brother is still in Beijing looking for that Shang guy!" Zhang Lao Liu added from the side.</p>
<p>"Alright, since that's the case, let's go back and report first!" The patrol officer automatically took down the awning, made small talk, and left.</p>

<h3>Random Chats in the Chess World: The Future Prospects of Weiqi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qu Qing</p>
<p>Currently, although there is no shortage of masters in the country, it would be difficult to compete against Wu Qingyuan. Moreover, they are all relatively old. It seems that there is no one among the younger generation who can shoulder-to-shoulder with Wu Qingyuan. If it is not promoted in time, the future decline is deeply worrying. Although there are many ways to promote it, the ranking of players is the most important. During the Qi and Liang dynasties, there was talk of ranks from first to fifth, but unfortunately the book was not passed down. Later, there were only names such as National Chess Player (derived from Mencius's "Yi Qiu, the best chess player in the country"), National Master, Master, Famous Player, First, Second, Third Hand, and White National Hand, Black National Hand, etc. Their meanings are all vague and not enough to see their true strength. Moreover, at each competition, if there is no original ranking, it is impossible to determine who holds black and white pieces and how many stones to give, which often causes difficulties, indirectly hindering the progress of chess. I occasionally saw a proposed Weiqi ranking by Layman Yingchuan while sitting with him. It was divided into fifteen ranks and could be considered in light of ancient and modern, domestic and foreign situations. It was very appropriate. I passed it on to colleagues, and they all said it was so. It is now written separately as follows:</p>
<p>Weiqi Fifteen Ranks, Division of Black and White and Number of Handicaps</p>
<p>Three Chess Seats</p>
<p>Chess Marshal: Play Even</p>
<p>Chess Supervisor: Gives First, then Plays Even</p>
<p>Chess General: Gives First</p>
<p>Three Academic Degrees</p>
<p>Chess Doctor: Gives Two, then Gives First</p>
<p>Chess Master: Gives Two, then Gives Two</p>
<p>Chess Bachelor: Gives Two</p>
<p>Nine Grades of Chess Players</p>
<p>First Grade Chess Player: Gives Two, Three, then Gives Two</p>
<p>Second Grade Chess Player: Gives Three, Two, then Gives Three</p>
<p>Third Grade Chess Player: Gives Three</p>
<p>Fourth Grade Chess Player: Gives Three, Four</p>
<p>Fifth Grade Chess Player: Gives Four</p>
<p>Sixth Grade Chess Player: Gives Four, Five</p>
<p>Seventh Grade Chess Player: Gives Five</p>
<p>Eighth Grade Chess Player: Gives Five, Six</p>
<p>Ninth Grade Chess Player: Gives Six</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Divorce Record of Wu Suqiu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>When Wu Suqiu saw the reporter, she showed no emotional impulse. She said, "He Lin is too unmotivated. I can't suffer with him. He always has a cigarette in his mouth. Who knows when his voice will recover? How can this be?" "However, the reason for our separation is definitely not because I have a boyfriend or he has a girlfriend. Please don't misunderstand." Qiu'er explained.</p>
<p>The reporter saw Wang Helin, a handsome young man of twenty-two. No wonder Qiu'er once loved him. Aside from the fact that his "waist bag of money" was not as full as Mr. Ba's, in terms of appearance, he and Qiu'er were a real "perfect couple." He said, "I knew long ago that Wu Suqiu had other plans. Some time ago, when I asked her to take a commemorative photo with me when we went out for a walk, she refused. It's clear that she has no 'love' for me. Why should I force it? I don't hope for any 'reunion'. From now on, I'm going to work hard, form a troupe and perform soon. Let's see who succeeds and who fails in the future."</p>
<p>Wang Helin may have become more motivated.</p>
<h3>Wu Suqiu, the Broken Mirror Reunited</h3>
<p>The Threads of Love are Hard to Sever: Suqiu Weeps Bitterly</p>
<p>The situation is somewhat bizarre. Wu and Wang's love had broken down, and the marriage certificate had been burned. However, on the morning of the day (the 19th) when their relationship was completely severed, Wu Suqiu suddenly went to Wang Helin's house with her sister. It just so happened that Wang Helin was not there. Qiu'er sat on Wang Helin's brass bed—the very place where, not long ago, they had been talking about love. Thinking about the future, she covered her face and wept bitterly. The Wang family did not know how to comfort her. In the end, they put her in a rickshaw and sent her back to the Wu family.</p>
<p>Does Qiu'er regret it? Has she been mistreated by some young master on the outside and thought about the good things about her former lover? Shanghai friends who like to gossip about Wu Ziqiu's love affairs, wait for the next chapter!</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The situation of Wu Suqiu and Wang Helin's divorce has been described above. We have just learned that they were fortunate enough to have friends mediate between them. They reached a reconciliation agreement on the evening of September 23rd, and both parties have returned to good terms. This is indeed a pleasant surprise. We hope that this young pair of artists will from now on sing in harmony and diligently study the dramatic movement. This is the right thing to do.</p>
<h3>An Unprecedentedly Huge Performance Fee</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's visit to Shanghai to perform "gilded" performances has aroused great interest among Shanghai opera fans. According to reliable sources, the total fee for the entire Qiu Sheng Troupe is 270,000 yuan, for a total of forty days of performances. The highest ticket price has been set at twelve yuan, and the seats are already fully booked, which can be described as an unprecedented success.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in the Jade Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: A Crown Rushed Off for a Beauty</p>
<p>Wu Sangui did not dare to neglect the imperial edict, so he immediately reorganized his troops into three armies, leaving Chai Yang to lead 20,000 troops to garrison Ningyuan. When the army marched into the pass, it was specified to depart at night in batches to prevent the Manchus from detecting and taking any action. He ordered his subordinate garrison commander Ma Bao to be the vanguard, and Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei to be assistants. Xu Jing and Liu Yinying were assigned to the right army under the command of Brigadier General Bai Xianzong. In early March, the army moved into the pass. At that time, the young Manchu emperor had just been established, and Prince Regent Dorgon was in full control of the government. He was consolidating the internal affairs and had no immediate ambition to encroach on the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, when Wu Sangui entered the pass, the Manchus did not initially receive any information and took no action. However, just as Wu Sangui's army had reached Fengrun County, a bolt from the blue suddenly struck. Bad news arrived: Li Zicheng had captured the capital, and Emperor Chongzhen and Eunuch Wang Chengen had hanged themselves on Wansui Mountain to die for their country. Wu Sangui was shocked and grieved by this ominous news. He regretted that the army had marched too slowly, so that he could not protect the capital and allow the wise ruler to die for the country, and could not save him in time. Moreover, his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan was also trapped in the besieged city, and he wondered if the beautiful woman could ultimately be safe and sound? This was what he was most concerned about. As a result, he immediately hesitated and temporarily stationed near Lishi Prefecture. On the one hand, he sent many spies to Beijing to gather information and then decide how to deal with Li Zicheng. Of course, the three armies under his command were all shaken. (182)</p>
<h3>"Family" Movie Story (6)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>After Mingfeng's death, it was naturally a deep trauma in Juewei's heart. From then on, he gradually developed this resentment towards the entire family. At the same time, he also expressed doubts about the social system at the time. Although he did not immediately take decisive measures, his anxious and restless attitude was always revealed in his words and expressions. Juexin understood this very well, but there was no way to explain it to Juewei, because Juewei had never agreed with his philosophy of compromise.</p>
<p>The matter between Juewei and Mingfeng had just come to an end, but the marriage between Zhang Yunhua and Juemin had stirred up huge waves. First, Zhang Yunhua was studying at a certain girls' school when she met the son of the local warlord Commander Zhang. Impressed by her beauty, he asked Feng Leshan to act as an intermediary, preparing to use coercive means to forcibly marry Yunhua. At the same time, Old Master Gao thought that Juemin had reached marriageable age, so he betrothed him to Feng Leshan's granddaughter and set a date for the betrothal ceremony. Juemin and Yunhua were both facing this situation at the same time, and they usually cherished each other and had long been in love. When the day came, they agreed to escape together as a sign of resistance. Only Juewei participated in their plan.</p>
<p>When Old Master Gao learned of this, he was extremely angry and immediately ordered Juexin to bring Juemin back at all costs. Juexin knew that Juewei had participated in the matter and wanted to obtain Juemin's whereabouts from Juewei. Although Juewei admitted that he knew about the matter, he refused to reveal Juemin's hiding place. Just as the dispute was unresolved, a message suddenly came that Mei had died of illness. Juexin and Ruijue both felt very sad. Juexin naturally knew in his heart that half of Mei's death was because of him.</p>
