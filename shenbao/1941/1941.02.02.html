<h3>同盟國聯合攻勢的應付</h3>
<p>在民治諸國言之，今年是「決算年」，就侵略陣綫而言，今年恰是「最後挣扎年」，惟其如此，德義日三同盟國利用今春發動新的攻勢，以圖挽救當前的險局，不獨可能，抑且必然。</p>
<p>松岡洋右日前在衆議院預算委員會所發表的言論，昌言日本非南進不可，且直言不惜援用三國盟的，而一昨希特勒所發表的演說，更露骨指明「潛艇戰爭將於今春開始，軍亦將再顯其威力，」同時並警告美國「將以魚雷對付一切以軍用品運英之船舶。」凡此表示，出之於美國國會正在討論軍備租借法案之際，雖多少含有恫嚇意味，但不能不使人聯想到德義日三國採取聯合攻勢的那個舊問題。</p>
<p>本來，遠在去年九月二十七日三國盟的簽字成立的前後，一般人即顧慮三國或將同時在歐菲亞三洲有所發動，以便在民治陣綫尙未完全團結之前，一舉而達到「分頭擊破一的目標；但是，數月來事實所昭示的，恰恰相反，日本和德義軸心結合的初意，似乎祗在消極地嚇退美國，而不在積極地加强合作；所以黑衫軍儘管在阿爾巴尼亞前綫吃敗仗，從木聞德日兩國正式援引盟的第三條，直到去年十二月九日，松岡還厚顏地表示日本對於盟的的實施，儘可作「獨立的判斷；」可見當時的結合，差不多是一慕互相利用的騙局。但是，最近一個多月來，由於美國態度的愈趨明朗，允其是由於軍備租借法案的正式提出，三同盟國的利害暫時又進人了一致的階段，不獨德義憂慮英國將自大西洋彼岸取得更多的接濟，致使義希交戰以還，德方所感受的軍事逆勢愈益加深；即日本當局也正爲美國的加緊援華而忐忑不安；於是數月來貌合神離同牀各夢的同盟關係，最近似又一變而假戲眞做。蓋三國的恐懼相同。對象相同、而所需的虛張聲勢，所望的恫嚇見效，又復一致；一言以蔽之，德義日此際都有在美國大規模援助的力量滲透及於前綫之前，迅速行動，以圖擊倒交戰對方的必要；至少限度，也必須做到牽掣美國，使之無法「東西兼顧」。此所以歐洲方面，有德國將於今年三月，發動「全面攻勢」的傳說，而遠東方面，亦於日本調處泰越糾紛，企圖自越方取得軍事特權並向荷印提出廣泛經濟要求之際，到處散布着關於日方準備實行南進的空氣。茲姑不斷言最近將來的演化究竟如何，民治陣綫當然早已採取必要的戒備，不過，戒備的重心，與其說繫於中英兩國，不如說握在美國手中，因爲中英兩國原已抱定抗戰到底的決心，中國全國各戰區固已積極進行「總反攻」的佈置，期於日軍南進之日，予以致命的打擊；即英國方面，可信亦必早已在海峽與英倫二島全部，完成關於抵禦德軍今春攻勢的必要設施；兩國今茲所盼切的，祗是更得軍事物資的充分接濟。以加强抗戰的力量，短縮制勝的期間而已。求之國際，能夠充分接濟中英，惟有美利堅合衆國，而間接因德義日攻勢而受到最大威脅的，也正是美國！所以，綜合諸般事理，惟有美國最能夠援助，也惟有美國最應該援助。昨天合衆社訪員於評論歐戰時，嘗謂「華府各當局咸信美國是吾捲入實際戰爭，將於今後十星期中見之」，又說美國在實際上已是「一個不發槍彈的戰鬥國」；美國海長諾克斯更在參議院外委會中，明言二三月內將有重大危機；可見美國識者早已認定惟有積極援助中英兩國，以擊敗同盟陣綫，纔可使美國眞正避免戰禍。他們深知中國如敗，美國必須對日應戰；英國如敗，美國又須對德義應戰；如中英同敗，則美國更須同時對德義日三國應戰，其危險可知。當此三同盟國正在磨拳擦掌，準備覷定機會，共求一逞的時候。吾人實不能不切望美國國會採用緊急程序，立即通過軍備租借法案，俾勿再蹈去年法國屈服以前，萊諾向美國呼籲無靈，以致坐失戎機的覆轍。須知同盟國所迫切圖謀者。始終是速戰速決；所朝夕蘄求者，怎樣纔得突然攫取勝利；它們現在決不奢望美國變更其力援中英希的國策，但處心積慮、方運用其宣傳，恫嚇，掣肘，阻撓，搗亂種種方法，以冀美國推行其國策之際，發生波折，遭遇磨阻，於是而遲遲生效。故美國方面倘若能夠珍惜時間，爭制機先，則必可使民冶陣綫减少許多不必要的糜爛，避免許多不必要的犧牲；要知愈躭誤，危機愈大，愈迅速，費力愈少，這是絕對的原則。賢明的美國民族當不致見不及此。倘若等到希特勒利用優勢空軍，發動對央全面攻勢、日本趁火打刦，跟着向南太平洋蠢動之後，美國纔慷慨力行，則事倍功半，太不經濟了。</p>

<p>華盛頓　海長諾克斯昨在參院外委會稱、德國勝利後、即將侵略西半球、渠稱、侵略之方式不外「直接與間接」、因德國亟思染指南美之富源也、德國首將攻得經濟之自足、最後則在政治上作向西半球移民、並樹立「傀儡政權」、故美國苟欲將歐洲之戰事、拘限於歐洲、必須一方面竭力幫助英國之海軍、一方面整軍經武、諾克斯並稱、據自德國傳出之消息、德國侵英之舉、隨時皆有發動之可能、渠言、德人現方在法海岸練習長距離之巨砲、並續作種種侵略之設備及演習、（一日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>星期日數推算法</h3>
<p>— 鄭朝强</p>
<p>工商界對於星期日數之推算，亦是一件要舉，不但工商界，即一般如有需要檢對之時，亦不可缺。這裹介紹「星期日數算法」可以推算任何年任何日星期幾，叫做「羅氏通曆」（RusselsUniversal　Calendar），現在先述應用於本世紀的算法。下面就是本算法的公式：</p>
<p>（日數十月份指數＋西曆年數之末二字十本世紀已過之閏日數）＋7</p>
<p>上式之餘數爲幾就是那天爲星期幾；若餘數爲零，則那天爲星期日。式中所應用之月份指數如下：</p>
<p>月：一　二　三　四　五　六　七　八　九　十　十一　十二</p>
<p>指數：零　三　三　六　一　四　六　二　五　零　三　五</p>
<p>西曆每四年一閏，所以要算本世紀開始到任何日的已過閏日數，只要把四除年數之末二字，所得之商即爲該數。譬如在一九四一年，此數爲十。但用到閏年如一九三二年時，則在三月一日以前，此數應爲七，從三月一日起爲八，因爲過了二月二十九日，才可以說是已過了一九三二年的閏日。應用上面的公式和月份指數，我們可以測算從一九零零年一月一日到一九九九年十二月三十一日爲止的一世紀中的任何日爲星期幾。現在舉幾個例來看：</p>
<p>（一）一九一一年十月十日（武昌起義日）：</p>
<p>（10＋0＋11＋2）÷7＝23＋7＝3餘數2，那麼武昌起義日爲星期二。</p>
<p>（二）一九三二年一月二十八日（第一次滬戰開始日）：</p>
<p>（28＋0＋32＋7）÷7＝67＋7＝9餘數4，就是「一二八」爲星期四。　（未完）</p>
<h3>南北貨　木耳紅盤亦高</h3>
<p>木耳以來源困難、底存有限、紅盤於是上升、昨開永記川耳爲六百二十元、又商邱耳一百八十餘包、六百〇二元、勢頗緊挺、</p>
<h3>建築材料　紅盤洋貨均漲　土貨無大變動</h3>
<p>建築材料、洋貨十居其半、現因太平洋風雲聚急、運輸發生嚴重問題、更兼歐洲各國積極備戰、鋼鐵限制出口、以故持貨者莫不居奇、以待善價、昨日紅盤議價、五金品較去年底漲起三分有奇、木材約漲十分之一、水料尚無正式行市、而人心向上、舶來品據一般觀察、尚有繼漲之趨勢云、（樂）</p>

<p>北地氣寒，冬令非烤火不易禦冷，然如京官雖貴，鶴俸所入，淸貧異常，故至冬令歲暮，有送以「炭敬」，助其買炭生火以禦寒也，不作苞苴看。古俚詞有謂「雪中送炭眞君子，錦上添花濫小人」；本出於宋太宗淳化四年，雨雪大寒，遣中使施孤老貧窮人米炭，蓋雪中送崁，賙恤於飢寒交迫之中，的是難能可貴。然而世態炎凉，人情澆薄，偏多如蘇秦所謂</p>
<p>「嗟乎！貧窮則父母不子，富貴則親戚畏懼，人生世上，勢位富貴，蓋可忽乎哉」因之錦上添花易，雪中送炭難，宜無怪拜金主義流行，一切有所不顧矣。</p>
<p>炭之火力强，至今如上海雖煤氣電氣盛行，煤與煤毬，亦代薪炭而爲燃料之主體，但炭之用途猶未消失。如良庖之烹調，仍喜用炭爐。金銀工作之鎔解，亦非用溫州靑崁不可。煎中藥，用崁最相宜，蓋取其文火緩煎，氣不易消散，汁可以盡出，如今各藥店代客煎藥，不無取其速就，遂用打汽油爐，火力急，速則速矣，其如藥之氣味乎？以是知炭自有其適當之火力以應用。並以崁質多細孔，易於吸收水中之汚質，故以爲澄淸水料之用。又如宋蘇東坡物類相感志所言炭之用途，則有（一）烰炭斷道，行蟻自回。（二）烰炭缸內水，夏月可凍物。（三）烰炭缾缸內安貓食不臭，夏月亦不臭。（四）鐵銹，以炭磨洗之；鈍，以乾烰炭擦之，則快。（五）杉木烰炭爲末，安門臼中，開門自能響。此前人之說也。余童年在校讀書，常用石版演算，久用則油滓，不易着筆成宇，故用磚片以水摩擦去其汚，但不如用炭摩擦爲佳。近見學生演算草，多用紙張，不帶石版，自是亦爲糜費之一。</p>
<p>木炭初燃時，有因炭中雜質未凈，爆裂作響，撒鹽於炭中可不爆，亦見於物類相感志。但炭因燃燒所發之炭酸氣（二氧化炭），能窒息，所謂中煤毒者即此。故不可靠爐取暖，並宜稍啟門窗，流通空氣，疏散煤氣。然如慮開放門窗走失熱氣，則必於炭爐之上，安放水壺，取其調節空氣之乾濕，並可以吸收二氣化炭。本來蒸木材時，常發生一種可燃性之混合氣體，名曰木氣，（Wood　Gas），設法收集之，可供燃燒之用。又發生一種暗褐色液體，再蒸餾之，即得淡褐色液體，名曰木醋酸。Pyrolingeous　acid惟現在燒炭之法，將此有用之副產品，消失於大氣之中，放棄於無用之地，能不可惜，故終必有改良造窰燒炭設備之一日，方可一舉而數和備也。</p>
<p>西洋畫中有木崁盡，用木炭描繪大幅畫，且爲油畫作底稿；蓋取其揩拂易，修改便。然中國畫亦早用崁條作畫稿，惟不用木炭，而以楊柳枝一端燒成崁，以代筆，繪人物底稿常用之。故崁宇一義，範圍甚廣，凡動植物燒成炭質者俱稱炭，如骨炭山查炭等均是也。</p>

<p>鐵道綫西　並未劃入</p>
<p>所謂五個警區之區域、傳已經劃定、惟鐵道綫以西之界外馬路、並不在「特警署」管轄範圍之內、茲錄五警區之區域如下、「第一署」北至蘇州河、東至公共租界疆界、南至極司非而路（除外）、西至白利南路一段（除外）、「第二署」北至極司非而路（包括）、東至公共租界疆界、南至海格路、西至憶定盤路（包括）、「第三署」北至蘇州河·東至白利南路片段及憶定盤路（除外）、南至愚園路（除外）、西至鐵道綫（除外）、五角塲地段、包括在內、「第四署」北至愚園路（包括）、東至憶定盤路（除外）、南至大西路（包括）、西至鐵道綫（除外）、「第五署」北至大西路（除外）東至憶定盤路（除外）及海格路、南至虹橋路（包括）、西至鐵道綫（除外）、鐵道綫以西、因大局不靖、暫不討論、</p>

<p>日司法界　猶在調查</p>
<p>宇林報云、日方發言人昨（三十一日）在每週招待新聞記者席上聲稱、一月二十三日納稅外人特別大會在跑馬廳舉行時、發生不幸事件、當時林雄吉有何行動、本市日司法當局已加初步調查、可望於十天內調查竣事、林雄吉已供認槍擊工部局總董凱自威、但須決定之問題爲林雄吉是否犯謀殺未遂罪、日當局刻正秘密進行審問並已盤詰若干見證</p>
<p>正式審問　將在長崎</p>
<p>一月二十五日林雄吉被日領事館警察署正式控以謀殺未遂、其正式審問、將在長崎舉行、按照日本刑法、殺人者處刑自徒刑三年至死刑不等、殺人未遂者减半處刑、日司法當局刻正調查、以便確知林雄吉犯殺人未遂罪、抑犯傷人之罪、蓋林雄吉已招認向凱自威開槍一響也、</p>
<p>外報認為　久懷惡意</p>
<p>昨日出版之密勒氏評論報評論日人在跑馬廳之暴行稱、本市日籍居民、對工部局久懷惡意、最近在煽動家及軍人份子鼓勵下、仇視更甚、彼等企圖獲得公共租界之管理、歸於失敗、乃於一月二十三日特別納稅人會議時、憎恨心理、達於頂點、遂演成慘劇、</p>
<h3>林雄吉被逮後　日方秘密審問　納稅日人尚擬營救兇手</h3>
<p>字林報云、據日方消息、納稅日人會常務委員會星期四日午後集會時、決議申請日方有關司法當局對被控謀殺未遂刻受初審之林雄吉從寬發落、會議中並推上海各馬路日人聯合會副會長三村等四人草擬此申請書、</p>
<h3>公倉已收米款　逾三百萬</h3>
<p>未繳者催請速繳</p>
<p>食米公倉委員會、自第一次委員會議決、倉米以每包八十五元爲標準、先照各人各業認購數額、收繳五成後、即開始收款、時值廢曆年關、各業在辦理結賬期內、仍能勉力繳付、足微顧全公衆福利、實行大會議決案之眞誠、其未繳各人各業、亦正由該會努力催繳中、茲誌已繳款額如下、銀行業一百七十萬元、錢業四十二萬五千元、百貨公司業四萬二千五百元、紗廠業二十九萬三千元、木材業一萬零六百二十五元、呢絨業四萬二千五百元、荳米雜糧業十八萬零六百二十五元、棉布業八萬五千元、新藥業及製藥業十萬零六千二百五十元、煤業二十一萬四千六百二十五元、以上十業、共已繳倉款三百十萬零零一百二十五元、</p>
<h3>日納税人悍然決定　不參加納稅會　英美納稅人將全體出席　擬支持加捐案使其通過</h3>
<p>關於工部局加捐百分之四十案、日方曾於上月二十三日納稅人特別大會中、提出反對案而代以如下之建議、「工部局當賡續實施减政、並就根本上研究改革現行征稅制度之可能性、當視各個市民之能力、以規定其担負稅款之比例、而代現行之自地稅及市政捐、取得大部分稅收之制度、俾征稅制度、更爲公平、並在此種制度未能獲實現之前、財政之不足、當以舉債彌補之」、是項提案、未能獲大會之接受、提案人林雄吉、惱羞成怒、乃拔槍襲擊工部局總董凱自威、致凱氏受傷、而行將通過之增稅案、未能完成表決手續、</p>
<p>加捐提案　勢將通過</p>
<p>現大會已定五日重開、就一般情勢言、加捐案由於英美方面納稅人支持、將以多數通過、已無問題、日方遂圖以不出席、而使五日大會、造成流會局面、故二十九日、日方召集各馬路聯合會常務委員會、及三十日召集納稅人常務委員及評議員聯席會、皆先後決議、日籍納稅人決拒絕出席五日之大會、惟以茲事體大、又於咋日下午一時、在蓬路日本俱樂部舉行納稅人全體大會、作最後決定、日方態度如何、殊爲中外人士所注意、</p>
<p>日決　反對</p>
<p>茲據大中社記者探息、昨日會議結果、日方已不顧各方之拚擊、悍然作最後決定、對五日召集之大會、決不參加、以示堅決反對增稅案、如日方建議不能獲得實行、則將來舉行之會議、決不參加云、</p>
<p>會塲內已　有新佈置</p>
<p>日方雖表示於下次納稅人特別大會時、決不再有不幸事件發生之保證、但當局爲預防起見、已在跑馬廳會塲、作嚴密之佈置、現會塲每一出入口處、各駐有萬國商團白俄隊員若干人、並不時在四週巡邏、內部現雖一無所有、但無論中外人士、均嚴禁入內、惟記者咋聞曾至會塲中之人云、現主席台與納稅人座位間之甬道、已有新佈置、可免羣衆衝至主度台、</p>
<p>外報　論調</p>
<p>英文大美晚報昨日著文評論日僑拒不出席納稅人會議一事稱、本市日僑、似已決意成爲全世界天字第一號「號泣之嬰兒」、及劣等之運動員、我人昨日曾建議、本市日本當局應要求其國人參加下星期三之會議、彼等若能出席會議、並能如貴婦紳士遵守秩序、則最低限度、足以證明彼等對林雄吉之非法行爲、不表贊同、然彼等似不屑爲此、寗願不參加會議、使他人相信、日僑不能遵守法律上之正當手續、</p>

<h3>讀書的方法和樂趣</h3>
<p>— 嚴玲</p>
<p>當你見有人駕着自由車，風馳電掣般的從你的身旁過去，你該多麼羨慕他呀！而你跨上去就跌下來，爲什麼？當你見有人出沒於游泳池中，好似游魚般的靈敏和自由，該怎樣羨慕他呀？而你一入水中就不得自由，爲什麼？這個答案僅是很簡單的兩個字：「方法」。一個是懂得「方法」，一個是不懂得「方法」。所以「方法」這一件東西，是一切寶庫的鑰匙。</p>
<p>爲什麼有人學自由車和游泳省時而省力？而有人旣費時又費力？這答案也僅僅是很簡單的兩個字：「方法」。所以「方法」這一件東西是學習一切事物的稚進機。</p>
<p>爲行麼有人做事愈做愈喜，有人愈做愈怕？這答案也不過僅僅是很簡單的兩個字：「方法」。所以「方法」這一件東西，是一切樂趣的源泉。</p>
<p>在社會上，沒有一樣工作不要「方法」好似社會的進化，也不過是「方法」的進步。從前是手工業，出產的東西少而又劣，現在是機器工業，出產的東西多而又精，這也是「方法」的進步。</p>
<p>讀書也是這樣，沒有「方法」去讀，是讀死書，有了「方法」，是讀活書。有了讀書的方法，學問就有了進步。</p>
<p>至於樂趣是人生的靈魂，人生不可沒有樂趣。有樂趣，生活才有價值。若是哭喪着臉，挨過幾十年，那麼生活便成了沙漢，要他何用。</p>
<p>在一般人的頭腦中，「樂趣」除了在遊玩時找得到，別的地方就絲毫找不到它的踪跡。其實，這是一個極大的錯誤，因爲「樂趣」是到處可我的。像小朋友們，現在正在讀書，也可以在書內找尋「樂趣」小朋友們聽了我這句話，一定要說：「不對，在我們所做的功課中困難得很，有什麼「樂趣」好尋呢？」</p>
<p>哈，小朋友們！你們果眞抱了書內沒有「樂趣」可尋的錯誤的見解，見了書本，就要討厭了，那無怪你的功課沒有進步了。要知道，要功課獲得很大的進步，非要打破許多難關不可，如果見了難關，不去打破他，反而逃避，那你自然只會發生煩惱，而得不到樂趣。反之，你如果抱了我樂趣的熊度而去讀書，和所遇見的難關奮鬥，等你把難關克服，讀書有了進步，那時你不是覺得快樂嗎？那便是從讀書上我到了「樂趣」。</p>
<p>讀書有了樂「趣」，那你當然可以克服了讀書的難關。</p>
<h3>氣球</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>廢歷新年隨着國曆新年而來了。新年是孩子們的恩物，他們日日夜夜地巴望着天天能過新年。在這新年的僅僅幾天中，吃玩兩件事是再忙也沒有了，而且他們的父母也不加以干涉，儘量的讓他們玩一個暢，吃一飽，所以新年可說是孩子們的新年。阿亮是個小孩子，當然也不能例外，時時拉着爸爸到街上去玩，回來時他的手裏總帶着一二樣玩的東西。一天他爸爸買了個會飛的紅氣球給了他，他當然是喜出望外。眼見得一個好好的紅橡皮球，爲什麼能漂在空中而不會掉下來的，而其他的東西拋了上去，總要落下來，這是什麼道理？便把這問題去問他爸爸。</p>
<p>他爸爸是很喜歡地回答道：「因爲這紅橡皮球裹面充滿了一種比任何東西都輕的氣體。所以我們叫這種氣體爲輕氣，它是比了空氣要輕十四倍半，所以能浮在空中，不會掉下來。其他東西拋了上去都要跌下來，就是連一根很輕的雞毛也是這樣的因爲這許多東西都是比空氣來得重，所以都要跌下來呀！」</p>
<p>「那麼爸爸能不能把裏面的輕氣放出來給我看看？」阿亮仍舊不十分明瞭的問着。</p>
<p>「傻孩子，輕氣是一種沒有顏色，沒有氣味看不見，摸不到的東西，這有什麼好看不好看呢？」他爸爸心中有些暗好笑的說着。阿亮聽得他爸爸不肯答應他的請求，便逕自的走開了。不過他手中雖是拿着個氣球，而心中最好是把那輕氣拿出來瞧個明白，因爲他有些不相信他爸爸所講的話。於是他便偷偷地拿到了一柄剪刀，把那紮住氣球口的線子剪斷了，便睜大了眼睛，想把氣球裹的怪物看個明白。那知他把手輕輕地一放，只聽得嗤的一聲，其他動情一些也沒有，不過頓時看見那氣球癟了下來罷了。於是他才相信了他爸爸的話是不錯的。後來他爸爸知道了，也不去責備他。於是他便放大了胆更問他爸爸：「爸爸，輕氣旣是看不見摸不到的東西，那麼我們怎樣知道有道種氣體的存在呢？」「輕氣雖捉摸無定，但自有它的特性，它本身能燃燒，更能和養氣化合成水。」阿亮仍有些不大相信，於是他爸爸再買了一隻氣球，把裏面的輕氣放在一隻倒立的玻璃杯中，更把一根着火的火柴向杯口上一點，便看見杯口上也着了火。因此阿亮才恍然大悟，更感激他爸爸不怕麻煩的試給他看，於是他牢牢地記在心上。</p>
<h3>小學生暑期作業競賽初級　第六名　　我的父親</h3>
<p>— 女靑年　會義小　張錫秋</p>
<p>從母親的嘴裏我知道：父親在少年時，是住在鄉下的，他在七八歲時，很是頑皮，常去毀壞人家種的植物，還要打人駡人，人家稱他是一個可惡的孩子。</p>
<p>父親九歲進學校讀書，他在校裏受了很好的敎育，所以品行，禮貌等等都非常好了，也常受村人的讚美，父親中心很快樂，於是讀書更用功了，父親用功讀書後，因此每次學期結束時，總是第一名。</p>
<p>初小畢業了，父親就不去讀書了，只因爲那時祖父已得了病，非但錢賺不着，而且田也沒人種了，所以家內吃也沒吃，從此父親只得幫着祖母種種田了。</p>
<p>父親在困苦艱難的生活中，長到三十幾歲，因爲家內人口多了，在鄕下再也不能過下去。於是，就到上海來找尋生活了。父親初是賣菜的，後來又上蘇州去賣菜，在那裏過了二年，仍回到上海，到飯店裏去做小工。</p>
<p>父親現在在上海公益廠內做，每月工資只賺二十多塊錢，但家裹有七個人，怎樣够用呢？所以工作之餘常做些買賣—取人家一些舊貨來賣—母親看父親太辛苦了，就說：「讓孩子們去做做工吧。」父親說：「現在還是他們讀書的時候，別耽誤他們，我還能苦，再苦苦罷。」唉！天呀！這話是充滿了慈愛與辛酸，我每聽母親講一遍，終流一遍眼淚。父親要維持一家的生活所以做了日工回家，還要做夜工，這樣幾天過後，父親再也支持不住而病了。病了兩天，一家的生活又發生問題了！父親看着我們一家大大小小，挨着飢，哭的哭，吵的吵，他再也忍不住了，祇能撑着自己軟弱的病體，到朋友處去借了錢，買了幾十本小說書和糖果，坐在路旁去賣，這樣賺一點錢，我們一家人才得煮點粥吃吃。</p>
<p>幸而上帝保佑，父親的病好了，我們仍能過過苦生活。</p>
<p>父親是很喜歡小孩子的，平時很和善地同我們玩，但我們惹得他發怒起來，他要瞪起了眼睛，長着紅的臉，很怒的駡了，有時他還要打呢！</p>
<p>父親在工作之餘，常把許多名人小時痛苦的情形講給我們聽，幷勉勵我們怎樣注意自己的品性，自己的學業。父親眞是一個最好的父親，該受我的尊敬和祝福。</p>
<h3>怎樣利用　壓歲錢</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>廢曆新年是許多小朋友們，收入—壓歲錢—最豐盛的一個季節！有祖父母給予的，有爸媽給予的，有親戚，近族，和朋友父執輩給予的，數目起碼二元，四元，六元，多的竟有十元，二十元，外面套爲「歲歲如意」「年年平安」「長命富貴」等吉句的紅封套，那樣色彩鮮艷，金字輝煌，迎合小朋友們的心理，引起小朋友們的興趣。在資產階級家庭裹一般福氣孩子，他們壓歲錢的收入，很爲可觀，少的數十元，多的竟有數百元，至近千元之鉅；而在窮苦家庭裏的孩子們，拿到家長們給予四毛或一元的壓歲錢，已是快活得手舞足蹈了。像筆者的一羣小孩子，每年大除夕，給予他們兩毛錢的壓歲錢，大家笑容滿面，能够知道來處不易，不肯浪費分文，都交給他們的媽，存儲作學校用品之需，這是我倆做父母的所讚許他們的。按「壓歲錢」的由來，舊俗每年於除夕或歲首，長老與小兒女壓歲錢，以紅繩穿制錢，其數百枚，蓋取「百歲」之意，是做家長的，給小兒們善頌善禱呢。眼前有不少的難童，和流浪街頭的苦孩子，他們的爸和媽都死亡在殘酷的砲火裏了！我希望享福的小朋友們，快移壓歲錢獻作難捐。或移助「淸寒貸學金」「小本貸金」，周濟窮苦的失學朋友，和難以活命的肩頭負販者。那眞是无量功德！</p>

<p>逰藝界</p>
<h3>珍妮·麥唐納　對於歌唱家的忠吿</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>珍妮·麥唐納，這一位偉大的歌唱紅星，正不知瘋在了全世界的多少影迷與歌迷呢。她的音樂片子，像「璇宮艷史」，「比翼雙飛」，以及最新的「新月」等都使人在腦海裹深印着；她的歌曲，亦莫不在世界的每個角落裏流行着。她的所以能够如此地得着熱烈的歡迎，而那種至高的榮譽，迄今仍能够保持不衰，當然是應該歸諸於她的不斷地努力，與耐性，與自信心造成功的。</p>
<p>「現在正是美國藝術發達得最燦爛的時期。」這位紅星有一次對美國的靑年音樂家們如此地說着。</p>
<p>「美國現在的那輩年靑藝術家，他們眞太幸運啦！」她接着告訴他們說，「二年之前，美國人耍好好地研究音樂，勢必要去歐洲不可，在那邊，無論音樂，無論歌唱，都要比美國的進步多多；可是現在呢，情形可大不同了，就在我們自己的家園內，我們已可發現許多天才，這在從前，似乎簡直是不可能的。」</p>
<p>麥唐納對於這一般後起之秀抱有一種非常的熱望。她渴望着她（他）們在最近的將來，都將成功最好的音樂家，影星與歌唱明星。每天，她在她的那只小小的郵箱裏，準可發現成百封的信件，這些都是由靑年音樂家寫來向她請敎「經騐」與「學識」的。</p>
<p>「我每次總儘可能地不使他們失望；」她說，「但他們似乎都有一種很大很大的缺點。那就是：他們太缺少耐性了。在工作方面，在用功方面，在練習方面，他們部缺少耐性。這在某些方面，原是沒什麼關係的；但是在音樂歌唱方面，可絕對不能够「朝三暮四」，與「虎頭蛇尾」。性急會使我們從艱苦中獲得的一點點成績統統完結；一個音樂家或者一個唱歌家，在未登台之前，一定先要經過重重的試騐，與埋頭的練習，否則，所得的結果，定必是一敗塗地無疑。</p>
<p>「缺少耐性，這就是說，不肯埋頭苦幹，其結果，就像是一朶剛要開花的花芽活生生地被摧殘了。我們只知道「出風頭」而不知道怎樣去學習，我們一心一意只想登台，而不知道如何去鞏固我們的根基；於是失敗自是意料中的事了。</p>
<p>「我們要我們的藝術進步，要擴展我們的天才，非要努力不可！非要有耐性不可！」麥唐納最後的勸告就是如此。</p>
<p>在事實上，不儘是唱歌是如此，無論那一樁事，莫不都是如此。如是要獲得眞正的成功，我們當然是不應該忽略麥唐納所給予我們的這個忠告的。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Surrounded in Southern Henan; Japanese Troops at Xiangheguan and Shahedian Successively Eliminated; Japanese Plan to Occupy the Entire Pinghan Railway Line Foiled Again</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A military spokesperson announced today in a formal statement regarding the recent battles in southern Henan and northern Hubei that the Japanese troops in southern Henan began their offensive on the 24th of this month, attempting to complete the occupation of the entire Pinghan Railway line. Simultaneously, Japanese troops in central and northern Hubei also launched offensives to coordinate and tie down Chinese forces. The Japanese offensive originated from Xinyang, dividing into three routes. One route advanced along the Pinghan Railway, probing towards Paomaling (transliteration). On the night of the 28th, battles near Queshan were underway. The central route briefly broke through Shazijin (transliteration), and the southern route advanced to a certain location near Tongbai. Japanese troops in northern Hubei also launched offensives in three routes. One route advanced from Dangyang (transliteration) towards Guanxiyai. After fierce fighting until the 28th, the Japanese troops retreated to Dangyang. Another route advanced north from Jingmen, but was also repulsed by Chinese forces. The first route advanced north from Zhongxiang and had retreated to its original position by the 27th. Therefore, this determined offensive by the Japanese troops has failed again. Chinese forces are now surrounding Japanese troops in the areas near Queshan and Tongbai in southern Henan. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Military news: (1) Chinese forces in southern Henan are implementing a war of annihilation against the invading Japanese troops, currently engaged in fierce fighting along the north and south banks of the Hong River, achieving significant victories. One unit that advanced to the vicinity of Xiangheguan has been surrounded and almost entirely annihilated by Chinese forces. The Chinese army has also cleared out the remaining Japanese forces in the Shahedian area. (2) The Japanese troops in various strongholds near Luoshan have limited forces and often rely on heavy artillery bombardment to create a false show of strength. After continuous attacks by Chinese forces, they have suffered many casualties and are extremely fearful. (3) The Japanese troops who invaded Yimengji and Zhaolvtun in northern Anhui redeployed on the 26th to support Hao County and advanced towards Guoyang. They were met with a head-on blow by Chinese forces. In the fighting until noon on the 28th, over 500 Japanese troops were killed or wounded. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs. (4) On the 31st, Chinese forces in western Zhejiang launched offensives against the Japanese troops in multiple directions. One route captured Dingjiaqiao and Mashan, strongholds west of Jiapu north of Changxing, at noon. Another route fiercely attacked Japanese troops to the northeast, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese reinforced their stubborn resistance. Chinese forces are currently engaged in a fierce annihilation campaign. (Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>China's Resolution to Resist Aggression is Firm</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the declaration made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in the Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee, qualified Chinese sources emphasized that Matsuoka's request for the National Government to reconsider its position in order to establish a basis for general peace between China and Japan was delivered via a broadcast speech. This was generally accessible to everyone but ignored by Chongqing. At this point, Japanese public opinion is eager to end the current war. Foreign Minister Matsuoka must find a way to make them patient while also pursuing a southward advance policy, hence the above declaration. However, as far as China is concerned, its determination to fully maintain territorial and administrative integrity is becoming increasingly resolute. It will undoubtedly ignore all peace attempts that currently only benefit Japan. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui Receives United Press Reporter; Expresses Gratitude for American Aid; Greatly Concerned About Soviet-American Understanding</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui, in a private meeting with a United Press reporter yesterday, expressed gratitude for the material assistance that the United States has provided to China since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Foreign Minister Wang said that not only has the U.S. government lent money to the Chinese government, enabling it to continue fighting, but a large majority of the American people have also participated in donations to aid Chinese orphans and refugees from the occupied areas. Foreign Minister Wang warmly praised American politicians, saying that officials in Washington have a very clear understanding of the decisive issues in the East. Foreign Minister Wang further said that the conflict in Asia is inseparable from the world war. The United States should naturally join the opposition to the Axis powers. If China can obtain military supplies that it lacks, China will not hesitate. Under the current circumstances, most of these military supplies are provided by the United States. Supplies from the Soviet Union have recently decreased, but this is due to transportation difficulties. China's relations with the Soviet Union are most satisfactory. Foreign Minister Wang expressed great concern about the development of close understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. (United Press Far East dispatch from Marmorris, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Responding to the Allied United Offensive</h3>
<p>Speaking from the perspective of democratic nations, this year is a "year of reckoning." For the aggressor front, this year is precisely a "year of final struggle." Given this, it is not only possible, but also inevitable, that the three Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan will launch new offensives this spring in an attempt to salvage the current precarious situation.</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke's recent remarks in the House of Representatives Budget Committee openly stated that Japan must advance southward and bluntly stated that he would not hesitate to invoke the Tripartite Pact. Furthermore, Hitler's speech yesterday explicitly stated that "submarine warfare will begin this spring, and the military will show its power again," while warning the United States that "torpedoes will be used against all ships carrying military supplies to Britain." These statements, made at a time when the U.S. Congress is discussing the Lend-Lease Act, contain a certain degree of intimidation, but they cannot help but remind people of the old issue of the three Axis powers taking joint offensive actions.</p>
<p>Originally, before and after the signing of the Tripartite Pact on September 27 of last year, it was generally believed that the three countries might launch simultaneous offensives in Europe, Africa, and Asia in order to achieve the goal of "defeating them one by one" before the democratic front was fully united. However, the facts over the past few months have shown the opposite. The initial intention of the Axis alliance between Japan and Germany and Italy seemed only to be to passively deter the United States, rather than to actively strengthen cooperation. Therefore, even though the Blackshirts suffered defeats on the Albanian front, there was no formal invocation of Article 3 of the pact by Germany and Japan. Until December 9 of last year, Matsuoka shamelessly stated that Japan could make "independent judgments" regarding the implementation of the pact. It can be seen that the alliance at that time was almost a mutually exploitative deception. However, in the most recent month or so, due to the increasingly clear attitude of the United States, especially due to the formal proposal of the Lend-Lease Act, the interests of the three Axis powers have temporarily entered a phase of alignment again. Not only are Germany and Italy worried that Britain will obtain more assistance from across the Atlantic, which will further deepen the military setbacks that Germany has been experiencing since the Italo-Greek War, but the Japanese authorities are also uneasy about the increasing U.S. aid to China. Thus, the alliance relationship, which had been outwardly united but inwardly divided for months, seems to have recently transformed into a genuine partnership again. The three countries share the same fears and the same target, and their needs for bluffing and hoping for intimidation to be effective are also the same. In short, Germany, Italy, and Japan all need to act quickly to defeat their opponents before the power of large-scale U.S. assistance penetrates the front lines. At the very least, they must try to constrain the United States, preventing it from "attending to both the East and the West." Therefore, in Europe, there are rumors that Germany will launch a "full-scale offensive" in March of this year. In the Far East, while Japan is mediating the Thai-Indochina dispute, attempting to obtain military privileges from Vietnam, and making extensive economic demands on the Dutch East Indies, it is spreading rumors everywhere about Japan's preparations to implement a southward advance. Regardless of how the evolution will unfold in the near future, the democratic front has certainly already taken the necessary precautions. However, the center of gravity of these precautions lies more in the hands of the United States than in the hands of China and Britain, because China and Britain have already committed to fighting to the end. All war zones in China have been actively preparing for a "general counter-offensive," aiming to inflict a fatal blow on the Japanese army on the day of its southward advance. In Britain, it is believed that all necessary facilities for resisting the German offensive this spring have already been completed on both the English Channel and the British Isles. What both countries are hoping for now is simply to receive more adequate supplies of military materials in order to strengthen their resistance and shorten the period of victory. Internationally, only the United States of America can provide sufficient assistance to China and Britain, and the country that is most threatened indirectly by the German, Italian, and Japanese offensives is also the United States! Therefore, considering all these factors, only the United States can provide the most assistance, and only the United States should provide the most assistance. Yesterday, a United Press reporter, commenting on the European war, said that "Washington authorities all believe that the United States will become involved in actual war and that this will be seen in the next ten weeks," and that the United States is already "a combatant nation that does not fire bullets." U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox also stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that there will be a major crisis within the next two or three months. It can be seen that American intellectuals have long recognized that only by actively assisting China and Britain to defeat the Axis powers can the United States truly avoid the disaster of war. They know that if China falls, the United States must fight Japan; if Britain falls, the United States must fight Germany and Italy; if both China and Britain fall, then the United States must fight Germany, Italy, and Japan simultaneously, and the danger is clear. At a time when the three Axis powers are flexing their muscles and preparing to seize opportunities to strike together, we cannot help but earnestly hope that the U.S. Congress will adopt emergency procedures and immediately pass the Lend-Lease Act, so as not to repeat the mistake of last year, when Reynaud's appeal to the United States went unheeded before France's surrender, resulting in a missed opportunity for military action. It must be known that what the Axis powers are urgently seeking is always a swift and decisive victory, and what they are constantly striving for is how to suddenly seize victory. They now do not expect the United States to change its national policy of vigorously supporting China, Britain, and Greece, but they are painstakingly using various methods of propaganda, intimidation, constraint, obstruction, and disruption in an attempt to cause setbacks and obstacles when the United States implements its national policy, thus delaying its effectiveness. Therefore, if the United States can cherish time and seize the initiative, it will inevitably reduce many unnecessary losses and avoid many unnecessary sacrifices for the democratic front. It must be known that the more delay, the greater the crisis; the more speed, the less effort, this is an absolute principle. The wise American people should not fail to see this. If they wait until Hitler uses his superior air force to launch a full-scale offensive against Britain, and Japan takes advantage of the situation, following up with southward movements in the South Pacific, before the United States generously takes action, then the effort will be doubled and the results will be halved, which is too uneconomical.</p>
<h3>U.S. Minister to Australia Gauss to Succeed Johnson as Ambassador to China; Awaiting Concurrence from National Government in Chongqing; Grew Rumored to be Taking Leave to Return to U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt confirmed yesterday the news that had been circulating from Shanghai that U.S. Minister to Australia Gauss will replace Johnson as Ambassador to China. The President said that he could not comment on the matter for the time being because the United States is awaiting diplomatic concurrence on the matter. He indicated that the State Department is awaiting the concurrence of the National Government in Chongqing. According to a message from Shanghai, Johnson will succeed Gauss as Minister to Australia, but this news has not been confirmed here. Some sources believe that if Gauss becomes Ambassador to China, Johnson will retire or take up another ambassadorial post, rather than becoming Minister to Australia. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told a United Press reporter last night that he had heard news that the United States was making changes to its diplomatic envoys in the Far East, but the State Department declined to comment. There is currently no news involving U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, but it is widely known that Grew is planning to take leave to return to the U.S. in the near future. A well-informed diplomatic source told a United Press reporter last night that Ambassador Johnson recently disagreed with Chinese officials on the issue of U.S. military aid to China. Before becoming Minister to Australia, Gauss was the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai and is one of the most senior diplomats. Gauss first served as Deputy Consul General in Shanghai in 1907 and held that position for four consecutive terms. He once served in the State Department in Washington and also served as Consul General in Paris. President Roosevelt nominated Gauss as Minister to Australia on January 8, 1940, which was subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate. After Gauss took office, the United States established formal diplomatic relations with Australia. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>

Adding the above-mentioned military expenditure to the extraordinary military expenditure of 1 billion yen for February and March, the total extraordinary military expenditure for the Sino-Japanese War from July 1937 to March 31 of next year will amount to 22,335,000,000 yen.

<h3>Status of Dutch East Indies Must Not Change; Dutch Government Declares to Japan</h3>
<p>London – The Dutch Minister to Japan, General Pabst, has been instructed by his government to send a message to the Japanese government stating that the Dutch government opposes any proposal to include the Dutch East Indies in the East Asian New Order, regardless of which power leads it. The message stated that the language used by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in his January 28 speech on the Dutch East Indies has no real meaning, and the Dutch government cannot recognize that the status of the Dutch East Indies will be guided by the spirit of this concept of a New Order in the Far East or tacitly approve of the consequences of its eventual implementation.

<h3>Japan Obtains Military Flight Rights in Vietnam; Rumors of Japanese Fleet Deployment in Thailand and Vietnam; Significant Threat to the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Vichy: Unofficial sources report that Japan has obtained military flight rights in Vietnam, French Indochina, ostensibly for "training flights." While Japan has reportedly requested the use of the Saigon air force base and the establishment of batteries in Cam Ranh Bay, these claims have not been confirmed or acknowledged. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Saigon: Reliable sources here report that Japan plans to dispatch a fleet of fifteen cruisers and battleships to patrol the Gulf of Tonkin and the Gulf of Siam. Japan already has a naval base in Haiphong, where it has stationed five warships. The Japanese are now hoping to obtain the consent of Thailand and Vietnam to station nine large ships in Cam Ranh Bay (transliteration) off the coast of Saigon, and three or four warships in Bangkok and other Thai ports. Well-informed sources suggest that the Japanese may obtain naval and air bases in southern Vietnam as a reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. Reliable diplomatic sources also report that Bangkok is reportedly demanding a large area of Laos and Cambodia from Vietnam in the peace talks, but Japan may back Vietnam and only allow Thailand to cede a very small area. To win favor with Vietnam and obtain bases in southern Vietnam as a reward for mediating the war, Japan may protect Vietnam. These bases would be very advantageous to Japan should it attack the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. Well-informed sources believe that Japan will soon take drastic action against the Dutch East Indies because Japan is eager to launch an attack before the United States establishes a strong position in the Far East. They say their belief stems from Japan's urgency to conclude the Thai-Vietnamese armistice talks and quickly complete the Tokyo Thai-Vietnamese peace talks. The French representative to Tokyo will leave Vietnam next week after formal appointment by Vichy. The Thai representative involved in the armistice talks may return to Bangkok tomorrow. The leader of the Japanese military delegation to the Thai-Vietnamese armistice talks, Major General Kaku, the chief Japanese representative, will fly to Hanoi tomorrow. A Japanese officer involved in the armistice talks left here this morning for Cambodia to handle the Thai-Vietnamese troop withdrawal. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Guilin: The news that Japan supplied Thailand with eight military aircraft, ten tanks, and 20,000 rifles is confirmed. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Thai-Vietnamese Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>Saigon: The joint French-Thai committee signed an armistice agreement at 6:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the preamble, it contains ten articles. Key points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To avoid further conflict before a definitive resolution of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, the Thai and Vietnamese armies should each retreat ten kilometers from the positions they held at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month. Police will maintain order within the buffer zone. The boundaries of both sides and the conditions for police duty have also been clearly defined.</p>
<p>(2) A boundary has been drawn in the Gulf of Siam. Warships of both sides must not cross the boundary.</p>
<p>(3) Aircraft of both sides must not fly over the boundaries stipulated in the first article. Articles four through nine stipulate that the armies of both sides should complete their withdrawal within seventy-two hours of the signing of this agreement. This agreement may be extended by agreement of the governments concerned. The implementation of the agreement will be supervised by Japanese representatives, and Thailand and Vietnam will provide all necessary facilities. Both sides should also exchange prisoners of war. (31st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Cabinet Information Bureau announced last night that Thailand and French Indochina signed an armistice agreement on the Japanese cruiser Natori at 8:00 PM (Tokyo time) last night, at sea off Saigon. It is claimed that although the fundamental resolution of the dispute between the two countries still needs to be discussed in the future peace conference, the Japanese government is extremely pleased with the speedy resolution of the armistice issue because both countries are sincere in maintaining peace and stability within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (According to Western reports, the armistice agreement stipulates that the armies of both countries retreat from the front lines to establish a twenty-kilometer buffer zone, with each country retreating ten kilometers. However, even after retreating ten kilometers, Thai troops still occupy several locations in Laos and Cambodia.) (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Bangkok: A communiqué from the Thai military headquarters states that while Thai and French representatives were discussing the armistice agreement on a Japanese warship near Saigon, battles occurred between the armies of both sides in the eastern sector. The ceasefire order was issued at 10:00 AM on January 28. Battles occurred yesterday at the terminus of the railway twelve miles north of Mongkol Borei, where five French tanks attempted a raid, but were all captured, along with eighteen prisoners. Thirty-seven villages occupied by Thai troops in the same area have been incorporated into Thailand. Fourteen Thai representatives will fly to Tokyo tomorrow to attend the peace conference that opens on February 10. The head of this large delegation will be Prince Vorawan, advisor to the Foreign Minister and former envoy to the United Kingdom. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: The Times correspondent in Singapore wrote an article pointing out the crisis contained in Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, stating that observers in Singapore generally believe that Japan's role as mediator is closely related to the Axis powers' plan to expand the war to the Far East in the short term. Several facts are sufficient to explain that Japan's purpose in mediating the war is not to restore peace in the disputed area, but to take the opportunity to interfere in all affairs of the countries in dispute, to gain a favorable position as preparation for southward expansion, and to satisfy the requirements of its Axis alliance. If Japan can establish a strong position in Vietnam and Thailand through skillful diplomacy or military force, preparing to defend Burma and Malaya, it would be in line with Germany's wishes. Therefore, some people believe that the real crisis in Malaya lies in the possibility of being drawn into the war in the coming months. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>French Military Experts Speculate: German Invasion of Britain Not Far Off; Mid-February Favorable for Naval and Air Operations; Germany Will Miss Its Chance If It Does Not Adopt an Offensive Again</h3>
<p>Washington: British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, expressed his opinion after visiting Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday, saying that Hitler's attempt to invade Britain must be launched as soon as possible. Halifax believes that Germany will probably start its invasion from six or seven seaports, rather than concentrating on Dover. He said, "The situation developing in Italian Africa, the Balkans, and Germany will force Germany to act as soon as possible." (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Vichy: Military observers here said yesterday that they believe that after the arrival of February, the long-expected German invasion of Britain is imminent. Even if Germany adopts an isolation policy on the border between the occupied and free zones of France, so that its secret preparations along the northern coast are not known to the outside world at all, observers here have this view. However, General Duval, a veteran of the previous European war, wrote in the "Journal," saying that the rumors are not based on facts, and only the German high command knows about them, but they will certainly not tell outsiders." Naval officers familiar with the English Channel and the North Sea said that for German troops to attempt a landing in mid-February, climate conditions must make it possible. Usually, in February, there is a clear period from seven to twelve days. This period is carried out at the end of each winter. During this period, it is easier to inspect routes and scenery when flying, and the sea surface is also relatively calm, not as turbulent as in severe winter. These climatic conditions are essential because if Germany launches an attack, it must use a large number of ships to transport food, ammunition, tanks, heavy artillery, warhorses, and all the objects necessary for modern armies in land warfare across the sea. If the climate is not good and the waves in the sea are endless, it will be difficult for these transport ships to cross the sea. This is the first reason why German troops should attack Britain in mid-February. In addition, there is an advantage to attacking Britain in mid-February, which is the length of the night. If German troops delay for a longer time and do not launch an attack, they will lose this opportunity for long nights. From tomorrow onwards, there will be many moonlit nights, and from February 26 onwards, there will be a period of dark long nights. Naval experts also said that there are rapid currents in the entire winter strait, and even in the narrowest sea between Calais and Dover, it takes at least ten hours for barges and flat-bottomed boats to cross. In other parts of the strait, it takes more than twelve hours for ships to cross. Therefore, if the invading troops hope to reach the British coast safely, they must avoid the eyes and ears of others, and quickly cross the sea during the dark long nights, without delaying for a minute. If the climate is bad, the waves in the sea are turbulent, or the currents are rapid, the invading fleet will encounter extremely serious and fierce conditions. Naval experts also pointed out that naval attacks should be supplemented by the army and paratroopers, but foggy weather is favorable for naval crossing, but it creates obstacles for the landing of paratroopers. If the land is clear and easy to observe, the weather in the sea is dark and avoids being seen, the wind and waves in the sea are not very turbulent, the currents in the strait are not very rapid, and the temperature is not very cold, then this kind of climate is truly the most suitable ideal climate, because the army that lands should not suffer from seasickness or cold.

<p>German Fleet Commander Declares: A Terrible Submarine War Will Be Launched</p>
<p>Berlin: German Fleet Commander Raeder issued a statement yesterday in response to Hitler's warning, saying that the German submarine war will be launched in the spring. Raeder also said in the statement that a terrible submarine fleet is ready to guide Germany to its final victory. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>British Naval Minister Urges Nationals to Rise Up to Meet the Crisis; Britain Is Actively Training Soldiers; May Reach Eight Million by This Autumn</h3>
<p>London: Naval Minister Alexander said in a speech in Preston yesterday that the most powerful military organization in the world, the likes of which has never been seen before, is using all its strength to attack us, and this is becoming increasingly close. This is inevitable. We must bear the brunt and face this attack alone. Either we subdue it or we will suffer. The greatest time in British history is approaching. We must rise up and fight. Our destiny is on a dangerous path, and this is not a new decision. Referring to the close relationship between Britain and the United States, the Naval Minister said that English-speaking nations have shouldered the task of liberating the world from tyranny and oppression. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: An investigator recently announced that under Britain's plan to expand its army, by September 1941, there may be 7-8 million armed soldiers. During the previous world war, the army mobilized by Britain was less than 5 million. It is expected that the number of recruits in outdoor training camps will triple. The government is currently stepping up the implementation of its plan to replace male workers in industrial factories with female workers, so that male workers can join the army. The Minister of Labor declared in the House of Commons that in the future, women will be used as much as possible to replace male workers in industrial factories, and said that several women and girls have already been trained to work in armament factories. At the beginning of the war, 6 million people were exempted from military service because they were engaged in armament manufacturing, but it is estimated that 1.5 million of those exempted from military service have been engaged in combat service. If women replace male workers, 50% of the workers in the arms factory will serve in the army. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Two Important Americans in Britain Inspect Coastal Defenses</h3>
<p>London: Two famous Americans, Hopkins and Willkie, who recently visited Britain, inspected two important fortified areas in Britain yesterday. Willkie inspected the defenses on the east coast of Britain yesterday. President Luo's representative visited the Portsmouth shipyards with British Prime Minister Churchill. Willkie told reporters that he thought the Germans had a difficult job now. Willkie said that he was deeply impressed by Britain's anti-invasion defense, and said that he would never want to be a German and try to invade the east coast of Britain. Willkie refused to publish the details of his travels, saying that he did not want to announce secrets. Willkie also did not admit that he had contacted neutral diplomats to visit German leader Hitler, saying that he would fly directly back to the United States via Lisbon. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Churchill inspected Portsmouth yesterday. He shouted "Three cheers for the American president" in front of a ship in a shipyard. The crowd responded enthusiastically. Then the Prime Minister, with a cigar in his mouth, put his hand on the shoulder of a shipyard worker and chatted with him. Before leaving, the worker asked the Prime Minister to leave something as a souvenir. Churchill gave him the cigar that he had already smoked halfway. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Letter to Pétain Contains Intimidation; Demands Franco-German Cooperation</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable French sources received by the Free French News Agency, Hitler's reply to General Pétain was intimidating. This reply was forwarded by French liaison officer Brinon. It not only reiterated the demands for active Franco-German cooperation, reorganization of the French cabinet, and promotion of politicians who are prepared to cooperate with Germany, but also mentioned the military situation in the Mediterranean and the necessity for French cooperation with Germany in this area. It is believed to refer to the French naval base of Bizerte in Tunisia. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Greek Gunners Show Their Might; Repulse Italian Offensive; Inflict Heavy Blows on Italian Tank Units; Tepelene Back in Greek Hands</h3>
<p>London: The Greek gunners' repulse of the Italian tank offensive has shattered the main hope of Italian Commander General Gavarilo, and is therefore the last effort in the Italian's fierce counterattack. According to information available here, the above-mentioned tanks are the latest type that the Italians can use on the battlefield, but the Greek flat-fire guns have inflicted heavy blows, either being destroyed or turning back and fleeing. According to unconfirmed reports from Athens, Tepelene is in Greek hands, or at least the Italians have withdrawn from there to Vlora. Meanwhile, Italian communiqués say that there is ordinary reconnaissance and artillery activity on the Greek front. Italian aircraft flew low to harass and attack Greek concentrations. An Italian torpedo boat sank an enemy ship in the Aegean Sea (at least 10,000 tons). (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek communiqué says that the Greek army counterattacked the Italian army in Albania, and attacked in various mountainous areas. The most important positions occupied by the enemy have been captured, and more than 150 people have been captured. An Italian tank that was attacking was destroyed at the beginning of its attack.

<p>Nairobi: A British patrol has penetrated forty miles into Somaliland, clashed with enemy native troops once, and several enemy troops were captured and wounded or killed. Only one British soldier was slightly injured. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Cairo: A recent communiqué issued here this afternoon stated that in Libya, British troops are still in contact with the enemy west of Derna. In Eritrea, British troops are intensifying their pressure on the Italian troops guarding the Agordat and Barentu areas. The situation on the other fronts remains the same. (Reuters dispatch, 1st) Somewhere in Abyssinia, I followed a British column into the Italian defense line in Awsa Rasas's homeland. I was high on a truck, guiding a mechanized convoy deep into the uncivilized areas. The road was quite difficult, but the convoy still moved forward with its precious military supplies and war equipment to Awsa's old department. Thinking that when they heard the drums of the Black Emperor, they would come together again to serve the Ethiopian Emperor. And the hope of victory will be greater than before. Officers and non-commissioned officers carried captured German light machine guns. The Ethiopian guards accompanying the convoy carried new rifles and some machine guns, all captured from the Italian army. This black and white mixed expeditionary force is quite peculiar. Both white and native soldiers feel that they are not suitable, and the natives who appear boldly along the way agree with this feeling. In the eyes of Ethiopians, all white people, whether they are Italians, British, or Australians, are villains. However, the natives already know that this convoy is coming with friendship, although there are poisonous mosquitoes, fierce lions, and sheep intestines, and the vanguard of democracy is now proceeding in the territory of fascism.

<h3>Internal Unrest in Italy; Friction Between Party and Army Intensifies; People Deeply Hate Letting Wolves into the House; Fascist Regime Shows Signs of Decline</h3>
<p>Rome: According to well-informed sources, Italian Minister of Transportation Venturi and Minister of Foreign Exchange Riccardi will soon go to the Albanian front as Italian volunteers. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: According to opinions from diplomatic circles in Rome, the reason why many Italian cabinet members have volunteered to go to the Albanian front is actually due to serious differences of opinion between the Italian army and the Fascist Party, and the Italian people's hatred of fighting against Greece. The "Times" correspondent on the Italian border reported that several members of the Roman diplomatic community told people that many Italian generals have realized that fighting against Britain cannot be won, and only a few Italian military experts believe that Germany has the possibility of victory. So far, the only agreement on German aid to Italy is limited to the air force, but people generally believe that Germany is now using this agreement as an excuse to send a large number of police or even troops into Italy, which has aroused hatred from the Italian military and people. It is said that the relationship between Mussolini and the Italian royal family, which used to be harmonious, has now disappeared for the most part. The consultations between Mussolini and General Baragrio have also increased day by day. Ba is a thorough royalist and opposes fascism in principle. Fascist Party members firmly believe that Ba's recent resignation was with the permission of the Italian King, and even suspect that the Italian King has designated Ba, who is rumored to be anti-German and anti-British, to take on a major responsible job in the future. A discussion can often be heard in Rome, condemning some military groups for intentionally sabotaging Italy's war efforts in order to overthrow the Fascist Empire. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Nazi Air Force Attacks Britain in Broad Daylight; Cannons Roar in the Strait</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, German aircraft sneaked into London during the day, hid in the clouds, and dropped bombs indiscriminately, hitting three London hospitals. One enemy aircraft also strafed fishing boats off the southwest coast of Britain. One enemy aircraft was shot down off the coast of Cornwall and near Lewes in Sussex. A bomb hit the center of a building in a London hospital, killing one ambulance driver. Two other ambulance drivers and one pharmacist were also seriously injured, but no patients were injured. The boiler room and ward windows of the second hospital were only damaged. A bomb hit the third hospital, and a few patients were slightly injured, but several hospital staff were seriously injured. The official announcement of yesterday's attack stated that enemy aircraft acted alone and dropped bombs from the clouds, landing in several places in the London area and southern England. Several houses in the London area were damaged, and incendiary bombs caused several fires. It is reported that there were not many casualties. The damage was slight elsewhere, and there were also few casualties. Official sources confirmed the destruction of two enemy bombers. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: According to the announcement of the Ministry of Aviation, after dark last night, there was a slight activity of enemy aircraft over Britain, but no bombs were dropped. In the evening, the artillery positions on the French coast fired on the other side, but there were no casualties reported. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, German aircraft bombed London and other areas of Britain, and strafed with machine guns. In the evening, it was reported that they had flown to a town in the eastern Midlands. The offensive was fierce. Three alarms were sounded in London. Two hospitals and several other non-military targets were hit. These several air raids broke a week of silence, and their offensive was the fiercest in several days, but it was not a full-scale attack, as it was still waiting for Hitler to issue the order. The British High Command predicts that the greatest misfortune will come, and knows that when the German air force comes with all its strength, there is a danger of using poison gas. It is now warning the military and civilians to prepare in advance. The masks that Londoners wore at the beginning of the war have now reappeared. No one knows what the new horror that has not yet been revealed is like, but all the measures taken now are to prevent the worst from happening. (Dispatch from the International News Service, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency praised the speed with which the barrage balloons rose over London yesterday. It is said that when German aircraft attacked London yesterday, the British anti-aircraft guns were very active, and suddenly barrage balloons rose into the air. In an instant, twenty or thirty of these silver-gray objects were spread over the sky. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Torgol Encourages French Troops in Africa to Rejoin the War and Await Recovery of Glory and Freedom</h3>
<p>London: Free French General Torgol broadcast last night, calling on the French army in Africa to rejoin the war to help conquer Italian Libya, saying that the Mediterranean war will suddenly expand its scope. If this battle fails, France's independence will be lost forever, and the French Empire will also come to an end. If this battle is won, the fate of the enemy will be sealed. After describing the role of the Free French army in the Mediterranean campaign, General Torgol said, "My armed comrades, French soldiers in Africa, are working with us in the war, and the fate of Free France and its empire now depends on the range of your guns. Will you put your swords aside, endure humiliation, and remain indifferent? You will join us in the most just war, that is, the war for glory and freedom. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>British Daily War Expenses Require 10 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Regarding the request to increase the special budget by 1 billion pounds, London economists believe that this is the inevitable result of "the continuous increase in daily war expenses." According to the figures, in June last year, Britain's daily war expenses required 7.5 million pounds, which increased to 9 million pounds in December, and now it has increased to 10 million pounds. Britain's increase in direct and indirect taxes has now been implemented, and it is expected that the government will issue new public bonds soon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>US House to Begin Debate on Lend-Lease Bill Tomorrow; Current Situation Developing Pressingly; Major Crisis to Arise Within Two or Three Months; Secretary of the Navy Knox Declares Determination to Defend the Philippines</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's aid-to-Britain bill (i.e., the Lend-Lease Act) is expected to begin debate in the House next Monday. It is believed the House will pass the bill entirely by the end of next week. The House Rules Committee has approved three days for general debate on the bill. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox, in presenting his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that there are several pressing developments indicating that a major crisis will arise within two or three months. These developments are concentrated in the following two points: (1) The German air force has changed its strategy, no longer engaging in indiscriminate bombing of London or ineffective efforts to disturb the English spirit, but instead conducting more effective bombing of industrial areas. (2) Britain has not been able to find effective convoy methods to resist the increasing activity of German submarines. To believe that negotiated peace can bring stability to Europe is a sheer fantasy. In the past month or two, German aircraft production has slowed, while British and American factories have produced more aircraft than the Germans. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox, while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, was asked, "Does the U.S. Navy never consider defending the Philippines due to strategic and distance considerations?" The Secretary replied, "We acknowledge the difficulty of defending the Philippines, but we have never disregarded it." He also stated that the unfortunate events in the world today all began when Britain refused to cooperate with the United States in upholding the Nine-Power Treaty and intervening against Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. However, it would be a great mistake if we were to refuse to aid Britain because of this. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Germany will invade the Western Hemisphere after its victory. He said that the manner of invasion would be "direct and indirect," because Germany is eager to control the rich resources of South America. Germany will first seek economic self-sufficiency, and then politically move towards immigrating to the Western Hemisphere and establishing "puppet regimes." Therefore, if the United States wants to confine the European war to Europe, it must do its utmost to help the British Navy on the one hand, and strengthen its military on the other. Knox also said that according to news from Germany, the German invasion of Britain could be launched at any time. He said that the Germans are currently practicing with long-range heavy artillery on the French coast and continuing to make various invasion preparations and exercises. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>Willkie Requested to Return to US Early to Attend Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Present Opinions on the Lend-Lease Bill</h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department announced that Secretary of State Hull, at the request of Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has forwarded an invitation to Willkie, requesting him to return to Washington to present his opinions on the Lend-Lease bill. It is believed that although Willkie's visit to Britain was very short, he was able to gain considerable knowledge. His presentation will be of great significance. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London - Willkie has received an invitation from Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, forwarded by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, requesting him to attend the committee and present his views on the Lend-Lease bill. According to Willkie, he has immediately accepted this request and will return to the United States via Lisbon next week. The committee will conclude its review on February 10. To attend in time, he may have to depart as early as next Wednesday. Willkie's planned early return home will likely cancel his planned visit to Ireland to meet with Éamon de Valera and his hope to tour Scotland may also be difficult to realize. However, he will still have ample time to see Britain's industrial efforts towards the war, such as Coventry, Birmingham, and Manchester. At the same time, Willkie will continue to talk to civilians in order to gain a substantial impression. As he told someone today, war is divided into two aspects, material and spiritual, and he wants to determine how the civilians are reacting to it. Today, Willkie took a bus and talked with several sailors. Willkie admitted to gaining considerable knowledge of the damage from the London air raids, and the impression he gained was the swiftness with which the British are recovering. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Whether the United States Will Participate in the War Will Depend on the Situation; Rumor that Germany Intends to Adopt a "Total Destruction" Strategy to Turn the Three Islands into Ruins</h3>
<p>New York - Washington government leaders all believe that the next ten weeks will reveal whether the United States will be drawn into actual war. The reason is that Roosevelt has implemented a complete "guarantee that Britain will not be defeated" plan. In reality, the United States is already a non-shooting war country and an unsigned ally of Britain. However, Hitler, like Washington, is well aware that the United States cannot supply Britain with a large quantity of military equipment within a year. Therefore, before this period, he will try to carry out a fatal blow to "overthrow" Britain. The reporter is certain that U.S. government leaders are extremely worried about whether Britain can withstand it. Diplomatic, army, and naval circles have told reporters that they believe Britain can drive out the German attack. A certain senior official stated that the odds are 40 to 60 (Britain at 60), but most of the President's confidential aides believe that Hitler's poisonous hands will not stop there, and he may adopt a "total destruction" strategy, using his great air force to turn the entire three islands into ruins. The destruction of Coventry and London is only a small example. The time will likely be around March, after the Nazi army occupies Ireland, that the United States will resolutely adopt a more active policy. The reporter personally knows that this is certainly the result of Undersecretary of State Welles's mission to visit the highest authorities in Britain, Germany, France, and Italy last spring. At that time, the war between Britain and France was still in its infancy, and the report received by Roosevelt also stated that Hitler was very willing to discuss peace. At this time, the talk of peace was rife, and there were even words to deceive the world, saying that Hitler was willing to give way in order to seek a just peace. Later, after Welles learned of the harshness of Hitler's peace conditions, he deeply realized the seriousness of the situation. After reporting the details to the White House, Roosevelt concluded that the "tyranny" of the Axis powers and the "way of life" of democracy could not be reconciled and stand together. The United States' aid to democracy plan was decided to be carried out on a large scale, racing against time. However, the United States has decided that if Germany does not fire first, the United States will not declare war. But now there are several ways that Hitler can declare war on the United States: (1) The United States uses warships to escort shipping to Britain. (2) The United States amends the Neutrality Act so that U.S. merchants can ship goods to Britain. (3) The United States confiscates ships from Germany, Italy, and other countries residing in the United States and transfers them to Britain. These things are all very possible, but Hitler must consider the following things: (1) Whether Japan will fulfill its agreement to fight against the United States. (2) The attitude of the Soviet Union. (3) Whether the tottering Italy can withstand the addition of the United States to the war. Therefore, Roosevelt's aides believe that even if Hitler wants to declare war, he will certainly adopt an extremely cautious attitude. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>The Eastern Newspaper Still Advocates Preventing US Aid to China and Britain; Claims Japan Will Not Give Up Its Leadership Position in East Asia; The Tripartite Alliance is Nearing a Testing Period</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun published an article today, stating that although the United States' policy cannot prevent Japan or Germany's policies, we must again advise the American imperialists to seriously reflect and, for the sake of world peace, cease aid to Britain and China. The Hochi Shimbun stated that Germany's adoption of a firm attitude towards the United States for self-defense is a very natural and reasonable move. However, the experience of the last world war has shown us that this kind of move is likely to induce the United States to participate in the European war. We can see here the imminent danger of an approaching world war. This is a real opportunity to test the value of the Tripartite Alliance. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Famous Japanese commentator Tokutomi, in an article published in the Nichinichi Shimbun, stated that since Japan has launched the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it should be completely reorganized on a wartime basis, so that Japan becomes a great military camp, and its people become a great military corps. Since Japan is leading East Asia forward, it cannot retreat. Japan's assumption of this great task was not without prior consideration, and the whole country's future depends on it. We certainly do not want to anger other countries or invade other countries, but the position of leader of East Asia forces us to make firm decisions. If we do not strive for self-improvement and let it take its natural course, then soon there will be a day when Japan not only loses its leadership position in East Asia, but also loses its own security. We must now forget all private grievances and share weal and woe with the country. We must especially let the world know that we have this determination. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Honolulu - Smiling Japanese Ambassador Nomura, after an eight-day voyage aboard the Kamakura Maru, landed on American soil yesterday and immediately announced, "I fervently hope that there will be no war between the United States and Japan, and there must be mutual understanding. I have come with instructions from the government, which I cannot disclose at this time." Admiral Nomura told reporters that retired U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson sent two destroyers to escort him, and he was "very welcomed." Admiral Swanson and Hawaii Naval Commander Admiral Hall arrived at the pier to greet the new ambassador. Former Japanese Consul General in New York and current General Counselor to Admiral Nomura, Mr. Wakasugi, said when reporters on the Iron Storehouse Maru mentioned complicated diplomatic issues, "The ambassador cannot discuss delicate issues on his way to his new post." Admiral Nomura said, "I am Japanese, and what I think will naturally come from our point of view. I want friendship. We are not considering war, only wanting to improve understanding." He said that he had twice refused to accept the position of ambassador, but now that he has accepted it, "I can only do my best." Referring to the Tripartite Pact, Admiral Nomura said, "Since the treaty has been signed, we should fulfill it." He advised the Japanese press in Japanese that Japanese residents in the United States should "loyally obey the laws of the United States." (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>At a Japanese Student Assembly, Matsuoka Delivers a Speech; To Drive Out the Powers of Europe and America</h3>
<p>Tokyo - This afternoon, Foreign Minister Matsuoka delivered a speech at the East Asian Student Assembly, jointly initiated by the Tokyo Municipal Government and the Information Bureau at the public hall in Hibiya Park, stating that Asia not only has vast lands, but also has thousands of years of history. However, in the past one or two centuries, Asian countries have been oppressed by the forces of Europe and America. The people of Asia have now risen to restore their true position and are making redoubled efforts to continue to move forward. Matsuoka also mentioned the world situation, saying that the current war was launched at the risk of countries oppressed by other foreign countries, in order to drive out foreign forces so that they can live freely.

<h3>Friction Between Britain and the Soviet Union Over the Detention of a Greek Cargo Ship; The Soviet Union Protests to Britain</h3>
<p>London - Judging from the current situation, new friction seems to have arisen between Britain and the Soviet Union due to the British blockade of the Axis powers. Britain detained the Greek ship "Corynssios" near the Falkland Islands and confiscated the leather and wool it was carrying, which was being shipped from Buenos Aires to Vladivostok. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has protested this matter. The British Foreign Office has promised to investigate the matter. At the same time, Maisky met with Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton yesterday to discuss this matter. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Shipping Protection Bill to be Submitted to the House of Representatives for Discussion</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japan Times recently reported that the Navy Ministry plans to submit the Japanese Shipping Protection Bill to the House of Representatives for discussion during the current session. The contents include various effective measures to protect the country's shipping industry from danger in the event of a full-scale war. The main points are as follows: (1) Authorize the Navy Ministry to protect overseas shipping and domestic merchant and fishing vessels from enemy attacks during wartime. (2) The Navy Ministry may promulgate special laws and regulations concerning the escort of merchant ships and the training of crew members. (3) In the event of war or any accident, or combat operations between other countries, the naval authorities may require shipowners to report the latest status of all ships and inspect them if necessary. (4) In peacetime, the Navy Ministry will consult with other government departments when implementing this law, but in emergencies, the ministry may act expediently in order to seize the opportunity quickly. In addition, the Ministry of Communications will also submit the Maritime Transport Business Bill to the House of Representatives, advocating (1) that the government may reserve a portion of merchant ships for special purposes, and (2) that the Ministry of Communications has absolute control over the organization, merger, dissolution, and financial management of shipping agencies.

<h3>Britain Strengthens Fleet Presence in South Atlantic</h3>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay - Well-informed sources here say that the presence of the British South Atlantic Fleet has now been strengthened. There are now at least three cruisers patrolling the South Atlantic: HMS Adventure, HMS Newcastle, and HMS Cumberland. The "Tribune" here reports that Britain has strengthened its presence because shipping in the South Atlantic has been repeatedly attacked by German ships. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>
<h3>Indian Vegetable Oils Can Replace Mineral Oils</h3>
<p>New Delhi - The Calcutta government's experimental laboratory has released its findings after three years of research, stating that almost all common vegetable oils produced in India can replace mineral oils as fuel for diesel engines, without the need for mechanical adjustments. Peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., can all be used without any obstacles. Although the cost is higher than mineral oil, it is worthwhile to try it under certain circumstances. The power reduction of engines using vegetable oil is only about 2% or 3%. India is one of the world's largest producers of vegetable oils, so the Indians are quite satisfied with this.

<h3>Grains: Imported Rice Slightly Cheaper, Speculators Get Ideas, But Ultimately Cannot Withstand the Abundant Arrivals and Storage, Prices Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Imported rice was in the red for the second morning. The market was due to the sudden drop in prices, prompting general buyers to take action. The market then rallied again, with sellers seeking to hoard and speculators attempting to absorb at low prices. Reports that Japanese merchants were procuring 700,000 tons of Vietnamese rice and the high cost of freight further stimulated buyers' activity. By midday, prices for all goods had increased by more than one yuan due to extensive purchases, with small quantities of refined rice being the most popular and having the widest distribution. Large quantities were once sold for 71.4 yuan, but ultimately, due to abundant stocks and concerns, as well as limited purchases during the New Year, the market softened. Subsequently, with more selling than buying, prices steadily declined, and ultimately, most prices returned to their original levels, fortunately stabilizing. Closing prices were: No. 1 Saigon aged rice at 84.5 yuan, new rice at 81.5 yuan to 81 yuan, No. 2 at 78.5 yuan to 76.5 yuan, No. 1 Siamese aged rice special at 85 yuan, new rice special at 82.5 yuan to 82 yuan, Zhongguan at 80 yuan to 79 yuan, refined rice at 80 yuan next to 78 yuan, small refined rice at 70.07 yuan, next to 68.5 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 70.0x yuan, red polished rice at 68.3 yuan, broken polished rice at 64.5 yuan, Zhongguan at 61.2 yuan, next at 56.7 yuan. Ying Wah Sze's futures goods were particularly prosperous and lively, with small refined rice for February and March at 80.5 yuan, February at 82.57 yuan and 83 yuan, and spot goods at 85.5 yuan, an increase of nearly one to two yuan compared to the previous market. However, foreign merchants were still selling futures, and there were several transactions in progress. Confirmed transactions included 700 tons of No. 1 Saigon for two-week delivery by Shun Kee Foreign Firm at 90.04 yuan, with 600 tons of hedging transactions. There were also more than 7,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>Due to the continued lack of supply of domestically produced thick and thin japonica rice, and seeing the early market rebound in imported rice, sellers' intentions also revived, and both local markets and local shops showed strong interest. Under double support, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice rose by one yuan per stone. Commonly sourced original-packaged special japonica rice opened at 107.8 yuan, Kunshan original-packaged special japonica rice at 104.5 yuan, next to 102.3 yuan, with the lowest seen at 101 yuan to 97 yuan. Green-tipped, thin paddy rice was seen at 95.6 yuan, original-packaged at 100 yuan to 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was in excellent condition, with sales still brisk, so prices continued to tighten by half a yuan to nearly one yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice specially sold for 77.8 yuan, next to 74.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Starch Demand Turns Sluggish; Wheat Sees Only Incidental Transactions</h3>
<p>The current starch market continues to be weak. Since the Chinese factories flatly priced the new starch after the price adjustment, Fu and Fu factories have been increasing the supply by 1,900 bags per day. Therefore, the street does not need to rush to purchase imported starch. Moreover, more than 30,000 bags of Australian starch have newly arrived from Hong Kong, and the stocks are still sufficient, so people's hearts are inevitably soft. The total market only opened with more than 3,000 bags of Flower, Bird, and Clock Tower brand Australian starch, priced at 24.4 yuan, but saw a slight decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan in the after-market. The Beautiful Boar brand was priced at about 0.2 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. Only the Blue Wheat Flower brand was inquired about by some northern buyers, and the price was 0.2 yuan lower than Flower Bird. About 1,000 bags were transacted.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions still lack a formal market. It is heard that Chinese factories once purchased 500-600 bags of Gao Du wheat in the New Year at a price of 35.5 yuan. Japanese factories closed at 32 yuan, but only 200-300 sporadic transactions were made. These were generally referred to as incidental transactions to liven up the market, and the market situation remained stable.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Has US Dollar Settlement for Imported Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's posted rates. The informal market for British and American currencies saw a slight weakening in US dollars as HSBC acted as an agent for imported rice foreign firms to acquire large sums of US dollars amid buying pressure. The spot rate opened at 5.375 yuan, and the current month was slightly tighter due to Hong Kong telegrams and other arbitrage activities, around 11:15 AM. However, the Japanese bank suddenly sold, so the underlying trend shifted from tight to flat. The current month remained at 5.35 yuan. Closing results were spot sterling at 3.375 shillings and US dollars at 5.375 yuan, down 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day's closing prices for both British and American currencies.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Receives, Japanese Merchants Sell</p>
<p>The morning opened with flat rates for London large notes and long-term contracts. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained unchanged. Exchange rates between the British and American currencies and Shanghai were flat, and there were no changes in the rates between the American currency and British currency and Shanghai. The Central Bank's posted rates for all currencies remained unchanged. The bank opened with a spot selling price of 3.390625 shillings for British gold and 5.40625 yuan for US dollars, the same as the previous day's evening closing price. After opening, HSBC came to buy, and Hua Hang Continental and others sold spot US dollars at 5.40625 yuan. Although Hong Kong Telegram also sold, HSBC bought in large quantities, causing the market to soften. The spot US dollar was made to 5.375 yuan. HSBC's posted rates were not changed, and there were no changes in the silver equalization tax. Thereafter, Hong Kong Telegram came to absorb shillings, and foreign firms sold spot goods at a price of 3.125 shillings. Until 11:15, the underlying trend became more active, and the current month's US dollars at 5.375 yuan were not easy to settle. It was also because the Japanese Merchant Bank supplied for sale, and the price turned loose. The current month's US dollars saw Li and a certain American bank purchasing from the Japanese bank at 5.375 yuan. The midday closing prices were 5.375 yuan for spot and current month US dollars and 3.375 shillings for sterling. Next month's US dollars were 5.34375 yuan and sterling was 3.34375 shillings. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Compared to the previous day's price, the British currency was down 0.015625 and the US currency was up 0.03125.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, both formal and informal, turned upward. The price once again rose to over 6,700 yuan, but it was a fleeting phenomenon and quickly retreated. There were very slight external changes. General exchange dealers such as Xin Feng Yong, He Sheng, and Da Feng rose from 6,628 yuan to 6,705 yuan at one point, but quickly fell back. Therefore, at noon, they slightly declined again, ultimately closing up 30 yuan. Three to four thousand taels were traded in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The cash market was more stable. Xiang He sold 30 taels to a certain bank at a price 40 yuan higher than the futures price. Later, Shi He sold 130 taels of Taikang Run, 38 yuan higher. Ornaments and customs duties remained flat.</p>
<p>Formal Market Rises 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially tended to be flat and weak, opening at 6,635 yuan at 9:15 AM, 13 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. It then fell further to 6,628 yuan. With foreign exchange softening, exchange dealers bought in. He Sheng De, Ji Tong, Kang Yong Shun Yuan came in one after another, and the market immediately rose by 37 yuan, reaching 6,665 yuan. At that time, Yu Xing Yong and Heng Ji sold small amounts at 6,645 yuan, and Tian Yuan, Ren Cheng Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, Xin Feng, He Sheng, Yi Feng, and Lian Xing were even more eager to buy, and the market rose another 60 yuan, breaking through 6,700 yuan, reaching 6,705 yuan. Limited-price sellers reappeared. At noon, exchange dealers resurfaced, and Da Feng, He Sheng, Xiang Feng, Shun Yuan, and Heng Ji sold off, retreating by 35 yuan to 6,670 yuan.

<p>Ornaments Have Not Yet Changed</p>
<p>The selling price per tael of silver building jewelry gold at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang remained at 690 yuan, with a reduction of 30 yuan for purchases.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Slightly Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw formal market prices rise after falling. The British and American gold pounds also rose in unison by 0.5 yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged and the market price remained flat. American gold notes followed a rising trend, with the price rising from 18.26 yuan to 18.41 yuan, ultimately closing at 18.39 yuan, up 0.13 yuan compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes was balanced and the market price remained flat. Japanese gold notes were in slightly more demand and the market price rose slightly, closing at 1.585 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was equal and the market price remained flat, still at 1.23 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Double Horse Soars, Highest at 1,490; Mixed-Brand Yarn Rises Especially Strongly</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising trend was particularly strong. This was because people's hearts were hoping for higher prices, and the masses bought in, resulting in a shortage of funds. At the same time, the actual demand from Hong Kong was more active, so the market sentiment became even more enthusiastic. As for most of the fellow traders, for 10-count Flying Goddess and Golden City yarn, they generally purchased, so the mixed-brand yarn rose especially strongly. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,481 yuan, and the lowest price was 5,440 yuan. It was made to 1,490 yuan in the afternoon. Today, 585 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse was slightly higher, at 1,440 yuan. Afterwards, it gradually rose to 1,448-9 yuan. This price fluctuated for a long time, but there was a general keen search for mixed-brand yarn, so the market price gradually rose and people's hearts were lifted. The buying trend for Double Horse suddenly became fierce, and there was a lack of sellers in the market, with each sale being above 1,460 yuan, with many saying that the price of 42-count yarn had greatly increased, and the price of 20-count yarn was naturally affected. The buyers surged even more, and it rose directly to 1,481 yuan at closing. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 8,880 bags were traded. The price of Double Horse rose by more than 40 yuan. Yong An Factory opened 1,550 bags of 20-count special Golden City at a price of 1,360 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 270 Ningbo 110</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 8,500 Statistics 8,880</p>
<h3>Outstanding Demand for Fine Yarn</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation feels especially strong because the yarn market is healthy and the Shin Shin No. 9 Factory is actively purchasing. Furthermore, the industry anticipates rising yarn prices and is eager to buy, pushing the market trend upwards. Transactions are estimated at one to two thousand bales. Raw materials for fine yarn have not only increased in price but also enjoy brisk sales.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is calm yet firm, supported by spot traders' purchases and robust cotton cloth trade. Consequently, closing prices rose slightly, about four to six points per pound. Indian cotton is again demonstrating firmness and rising; yesterday, prices, including forecasts, increased by three rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market was very active yesterday. Besides factories actively buying to cover their raw cotton needs, trading among firms was also quite vibrant. It is expected that this activity will reach a peak in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Eastern Textiles Futures Launch - Across-the-Board Price Surge</h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices surged yesterday due to the launch of futures trading in Eastern Textiles fine cloth, causing a monthly price increase. The bullish momentum is strong, and prices for cloths from this factory also surged. Fine cloth was the most sought-after, increasing by one to one and a half yuan per bolt. Fine twill increased by about one yuan per bolt, coarse cloth by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and bleached and dyed cloth by one to two yuan. Trading on this street involved several thousand bolts of various cloths. Merchants from Zhejiang's Wenzhou and Ningbo traded over one hundred bolts of bleached and dyed coarse and fine cloths. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong traded over two hundred bolts of blue cloth, colored twill, coarse and fine cloth, and poplin. Merchants from northern Shandong province traded over one hundred bolts of coarse and colored cloth. Three hundred and ninety bolts of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong in two days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the (Stock Exchange) launched futures trading of Eastern Textiles "Dragon Head" fine cloth, stirring excitement and driving up prices dramatically. The regulations stipulating grades for miscellaneous brands of fine cloth, allowing them to be used as collateral, also contributed to the uniform price surge, pushing up the overall increase to about 1.5 yuan per bolt. The spot price of "Dragon Head" current inventory in the market rose to a closing price of 48 yuan. After-hours trading reached 48.25 yuan. (Stock Exchange) Futures prices were as follows: February, 49.20 yuan; March, 51.35 yuan; April, 53.90 yuan; May, 54.39 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sudden Tremors in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Most Prices Still Rising</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds started well yesterday, gradually climbing by six to seven jiao. Just as the market was recovering, unexpected rumors emerged, suggesting potential market manipulators. This sparked widespread speculation and anxiety. Yu Xing, Lian Yi, Da Hua, and Da Feng saw the most aggressive selling, impacting market prices and causing them to falter. Although Tong Kang, Heng Fu, Tong Shun, and Xin Chang bought, Tian Sheng and Ren Chang also sold, preventing prices from rising. It is difficult to make predictions, but it is feared that the market will become turbulent and may not stabilize easily. Ultimately, prices recovered, except for Series E, which declined slightly by two jiao. The remaining bonds rose by one to four jiao. The total trading volume was estimated at over two million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: Fifty shares of Wing On Company stock were traded at a price of 21.50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Oil Cakes: Lively Soybean Cake Trading, Slight Drop in Raw Soybean Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil cake market was dominated by brisk soybean cake trading, driven by smooth exports to Hong Kong and speculative fervor, leading to unusually high transaction volumes. However, due to simultaneous arrivals of both new and stored inventories, the market mood was subdued, with prices fluctuating up and down. It is estimated that over 8,000 pieces of various brands of spot cakes were traded (prices detailed in the market price section), along with 23,400 pieces of various brands of futures cakes. The oil market was dull, with all types of raw soybean oil falling by about one yuan.

<h3>A Method for Calculating the Day of the Week</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chaoqiang</p>
<p>The calculation of the day of the week is an important matter for the business community and the general public alike when needing to check dates. Here, I introduce the "Day of the Week Calculation Method," which can calculate the day of the week for any date in any year. It's called the "Russell's Universal Calendar." I will first explain its application for this century. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(Day + Month Index + Last Two Digits of the Gregorian Year + Number of Leap Days Passed in This Century) ÷ 7</p>
<p>The remainder of the above formula indicates the day of the week. If the remainder is zero, then that day is Sunday. The month indices used in the formula are as follows:</p>
<p>Month: January February March April May June July August September October November December</p>
<p>Index: 0 3 3 6 1 4 6 2 5 0 3 5</p>
<p>A Gregorian year has a leap year every four years. So, to calculate the number of leap days passed from the beginning of this century to any given date, simply divide the last two digits of the year by four. The quotient is the number of leap days. For example, in 1941, this number is 10. However, in a leap year like 1932, before March 1st, this number should be 7; from March 1st onwards, it becomes 8, because after February 29th, it can be said that the leap day of 1932 has passed. Using the above formula and month indices, we can calculate the day of the week for any date from January 1, 1900, to December 31, 1999. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) October 10, 1911 (Wuchang Uprising):</p>
<p>(10 + 0 + 11 + 2) ÷ 7 = 23 ÷ 7 = 3 with a remainder of 2, so the Wuchang Uprising day was a Tuesday.</p>
<p>(2) January 28, 1932 (Start of the First Shanghai Incident):</p>
<p>(28 + 0 + 32 + 7) ÷ 7 = 67 ÷ 7 = 9 with a remainder of 4, so January 28th was a Thursday. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Wood Ear Prices Also High</h3>
<p>Due to difficult sourcing and limited inventory, wood ear prices have risen. Yesterday, Yongji Sichuan wood ear opened at 620 yuan, and Shangqiu wood ear (over 180 packages) at 602 yuan, demonstrating considerable strength.</p>
<h3>Construction Materials: Both Imported and Red-Label Goods Rise, Domestic Goods Show No Major Changes</h3>
<p>Imported goods account for half of the construction materials market. Due to the escalating tensions in the Pacific and serious transport problems, coupled with European countries actively preparing for war and restricting steel exports, holders of goods are holding out for better prices. Yesterday's red-label negotiated prices showed hardware prices rising by over 30% compared to the end of last year, and timber rising by about 10%. There are no formal market prices for aquatic materials, but sentiment is upward. According to general observations, imported goods are likely to continue to rise. (Le)</p>
<h3>Economic Reflections</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Charcoal (2)</p>
<p>The weather is cold in the north, and it is difficult to ward off the chill in winter without heating, but even for officials in the capital, despite their status, their meager salaries make them exceptionally poor. Therefore, towards the end of winter, they receive "charcoal tribute" to help them buy charcoal to heat their homes, which is not seen as bribery. As the old saying goes, "To offer charcoal in snow is a true gentleman; to add flowers to brocade is a mere sycophant." This originated in the fourth year of the Chunhua era of the Song Dynasty, when it snowed heavily and was very cold. The emperor sent envoys to distribute rice and charcoal to the lonely, the elderly, and the poor. Offering charcoal in the snow, helping those suffering from hunger and cold, is truly commendable. However, the world is fickle, and human relationships are superficial. There are too many instances like what Su Qin said:</p>
<p>"Alas! When poor, even your parents do not treat you as a son; when rich and powerful, even your relatives fear you. In this life, status, power, and wealth are things that cannot be ignored!" Therefore, it's easier to add flowers to brocade than to offer charcoal in the snow. It is no wonder that materialism prevails, and people disregard everything else.</p>
<p>Charcoal has strong heating power. Even in Shanghai today, where gas and electricity are prevalent, coal and coal briquettes have replaced firewood as the main fuel, but the use of charcoal has not disappeared. For example, good chefs still prefer using charcoal stoves for cooking. The melting of gold and silver still requires the use of Wenzhou green charcoal. Using charcoal to decoct Chinese medicine is most suitable, as it provides gentle heat and allows the medicine to simmer slowly, preventing the aroma from dissipating and extracting the essence completely. Nowadays, many pharmacies use gas stoves to decoct medicine for customers, as it is faster, but the rapid heat affects the flavor of the medicine. Thus, charcoal has its appropriate heating power for specific uses. Charcoal also has many fine pores, making it easy to absorb impurities in water, so it is used to clarify water. Furthermore, the "Things That Affect Each Other" by Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty mentions the uses of charcoal: (1) Draw a line with charcoal, and ants will turn back. (2) Put charcoal in a water container, and it can freeze things in the summer. (3) Put charcoal in a jar where you keep cat food, and it won't smell bad, even in the summer. (4) Remove rust from iron by rubbing it with charcoal; sharpen dull objects by rubbing them with dry charcoal. (5) Grind fir wood charcoal into powder and place it in the door socket to make the door creak when opened. These are things that people of the past said. When I was a child, I often used a slate for calculations. After long use, it would become greasy and difficult to write on, so I would use a brick to rub off the grease with water, but rubbing with charcoal was better. Nowadays, students mostly use paper for calculations, without slates, which is also wasteful.</p>
<p>When charcoal first starts burning, it sometimes explodes and crackles due to impurities in the charcoal. Sprinkling salt in the charcoal can prevent explosions, as also mentioned in "Things That Affect Each Other." However, the carbon dioxide produced by burning charcoal can cause suffocation, which is what we call coal poisoning. Therefore, you should not rely on stoves for heating and should slightly open doors and windows to circulate air and disperse the gas. However, if you are worried about losing heat by opening doors and windows, you must place a kettle of water on the charcoal stove to regulate the humidity of the air and absorb carbon dioxide. Originally, when steaming wood, a flammable mixed gas called wood gas is produced. If a way is found to collect it, it can be used for burning. A dark brown liquid is also produced. After redistilling it, you get a light brown liquid called pyroligneous acid. However, the current method of burning charcoal wastes these useful byproducts, releasing them into the atmosphere, which is a pity. Therefore, there must be a day when improved kiln construction and charcoal-burning equipment will be developed, allowing us to achieve multiple benefits at once.</p>
<p>In Western painting, charcoal is often used to create large-scale drawings and as a base for oil paintings, as it is easy to erase and modify. In Chinese painting, charcoal sticks were also used early on for drawing drafts, but instead of using wood charcoal, willow branches were burned to make charcoal to use as a brush for drawing drafts of figures. Therefore, the term "charcoal" has a broad meaning. Anything burned into charcoal, whether from plants or animals, is called charcoal, such as bone charcoal and hawthorn charcoal.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of police authority over roads beyond the Shanghai West concessions, a temporary agreement was established in February of last year, agreeing to establish a special police force. After further negotiations between both parties, a formal agreement was finally signed yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 AM at the Municipal Government by Mayor Chen Gongbo and the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick.

<p>Agreement Signing Details</p>
<p>According to reports from the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Municipal Government signed a formal agreement yesterday morning (the 1st) at 10:00 AM in the city center to establish a special police force in the "joint district" of Shanghai West, delivering a preliminary fatal blow to various criminal activities in the areas beyond the concessions' roads. Signing the agreement yesterday morning were Keswick, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Chen Gongbo from the Municipal Government. Several Western and Japanese reporters were present to take photos. Keswick's arm was still in a sling, suspended around his neck, due to a gunshot wound he sustained at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on January 23rd, but his injury seems to have fully healed otherwise. Keswick arrived at the city center at around 10:00 AM, accompanied by Felling, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Major Bowering, Head of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Mr. Bolan, lawyer, Mr. Peasley, Assistant Secretary-General, and a Japanese Deputy Secretary-General. Accompanying Chen Gongbo were Lu Yang, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, and You Wenzao, Secretary of the Municipal Government. The agreement was in both Chinese and English. After signing, they toasted with champagne and departed.</p>

<p>The special police force is named the "Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters." Its jurisdiction covers the areas beyond the concessions of the International Settlement and the French Concession, divided into five police districts. The maximum number of officers is set at 1,446. The cap badges will feature the characters "Special Police." The Special Police Headquarters has one Chief (Chinese), one Deputy Chief (Westerner), and six sections: General Affairs, Administration, Special Higher Police, Foreign Affairs, Criminal Investigation, and Inspection, as well as a Secretariat.

<p>Area West of the Railway Line Not Included</p>
<p>The areas of the five police districts are said to have been demarcated, but the roads beyond the concessions west of the railway line are not within the jurisdiction of the "Special Police Headquarters." The areas of the five police districts are listed as follows: "First Station": North to the Suzhou Creek, East to the boundary of the International Settlement, South to Jessfield Road (excluding), West to a section of Brenan Road (excluding).

"Fifth Station": North to Great Western Road (excluding), East to Edinburgh Road (excluding) and Haig Avenue, South to Hongqiao Road (including), West to the railway line (excluding). The area west of the railway line is not discussed for the time being due to the unstable situation.</p>
<p>Foreign-Related Incidents Handled by Specialized Section</p>
<p>To ensure efficient handling, incidents involving foreigners will be handled by the Deputy Chief, who will supervise the Foreign Affairs Section and foreign personnel in accordance with the current laws of the respective foreign countries. Nationals of countries that have abolished consular jurisdiction or do not have treaties will be handled in accordance with current Chinese laws.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Opium and Gambling to Be Achieved Within a Limited Time</p>
<p>A special clause is added as follows: When the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters is organized and performing its duties, it shall abide by the laws of the Republic of China, and no improper businesses (such as gambling dens and the sale and provision of opium and other drugs) shall be allowed to exist within its jurisdiction. Upon the establishment of the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters, all improper businesses shall be ordered to cease immediately. If any attempt is made to re-establish them in the future, they shall be immediately shut down.</p>
<p>Three Appendices Contain General Content</p>
<p>The appendices to the "Shanghai West Police Authority Agreement" are said to be divided into three parts. The contents are rumored to be as follows: (1) Regarding the joint investigation of criminals by the "Special Police Headquarters" and the Shanghai Municipal Police: If a crime is committed in the Shanghai West area and the perpetrator escapes into the area of the International Settlement, after being pursued and arrested, they will be registered at the relevant police station and then handed over to the original investigating officer. The reverse will also be handled in the same way. In the case of major criminals who commit armed kidnapping, abduction, armed robbery, robbery, threatening letters, extortion, assassination, or attempted assassination, if the "Special Police Headquarters" discovers that they are hiding in the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police and cooperates in their capture, they shall be immediately handed over. (2) Regarding the procedures for the "Chief" and "Deputy Chief" to handle affairs. (3) Regarding the regulations of the "Special Police Reserve Team," whose purpose is to suppress riots and labor unrest.</p>
<p>Establishment Date Still Unknown</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," officials were unable to specify when the new police force will be established yesterday morning. However, they stated that if the details of the new police force proceed smoothly, the police authority agreement may be implemented this month. As soon as the new police force is established, all gambling dens in the "joint district" will be closed, and other criminal establishments will not be allowed to open.</p>
<p>Japanese Judiciary Still Investigating</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that a Japanese spokesman stated at the weekly press briefing yesterday (the 31st) that the Japanese judicial authorities in this city have launched a preliminary investigation into Lin Xiongji's actions during the unfortunate incident at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on January 23rd at the Race Course. The investigation is expected to be completed within ten days. Lin Xiongji has admitted to shooting Keswick, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the question of whether Lin Xiongji committed attempted murder needs to be determined. The Japanese authorities are conducting a secret interrogation and have questioned several witnesses.</p>
<p>Formal Trial to Be Held in Nagasaki</p>
<p>On January 25th, Lin Xiongji was formally charged with attempted murder by the Japanese Consular Police. His formal trial will be held in Nagasaki. According to Japanese criminal law, murder is punishable by imprisonment from three years to death. Attempted murder is punishable by half the sentence. The Japanese judicial authorities are currently investigating to determine whether Lin Xiongji committed attempted murder or assault, as Lin Xiongji has admitted to firing a shot at Keswick.</p>
<p>Foreign Media's View: Long-Standing Malice</p>
<p>Yesterday's Millard's Review commented on the Japanese's violence at the Race Course, stating that Japanese residents of this city have long harbored malice towards the Shanghai Municipal Council. Recently, encouraged by agitators and military personnel, their hostility has intensified. Their attempt to gain control of the International Settlement failed, and their hatred reached its peak at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on January 23rd, resulting in a tragedy.</p>
<h3>After Lin Xiongji's Arrest, Japanese Secretly Interrogating; Taxpaying Japanese Also Plan to Rescue the Culprit</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to Japanese sources, the Standing Committee of the Japanese Ratepayers' Association met on Thursday afternoon and decided to apply to the relevant Japanese judicial authorities to leniently sentence Lin Xiongji, who is accused of attempted murder and is undergoing preliminary trial. At the meeting, four people, including Mimura, Vice Chairman of the United Association of Japanese Roads in Shanghai, were selected to draft the application.</p>
<h3>Public Granary Has Collected Over 3 Million in Rice Payments</h3>
<p>Those Who Have Not Paid Are Urged to Pay Promptly</p>
<p>Since the first meeting of the Public Rice Granary Committee resolved that the standard price for granary rice would be 85 yuan per bag, payments have been collected in phases, starting with 50% of the amount subscribed by each person and each industry. Despite the Lunar New Year holidays, when businesses were closing accounts, they were still able to make payments, showing genuine sincerity in upholding public welfare and implementing the resolution of the general meeting. The committee is also working hard to urge those who have not paid to do so. The amount of money already paid is recorded as follows: Banking industry: 1.7 million yuan, Money Exchange industry: 425,000 yuan, Department Store industry: 42,500 yuan, Cotton Mill industry: 293,000 yuan, Timber industry: 10,625 yuan, Woolen Fabric industry: 42,500 yuan, Bean and Grain industry: 180,625 yuan, Cotton Cloth industry: 85,000 yuan, New Medicine and Pharmaceutical industry: 106,250 yuan, Coal industry: 214,625 yuan. The total payment of the above ten industries is 3,100,125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Taxpayers Boldly Decide Not to Participate in Taxpayers' Meeting; British and American Taxpayers Will Attend En Masse to Support the Tax Increase Proposal and Ensure Its Passage</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to increase taxes by 40%, the Japanese side had opposed it at the Special Ratepayers' Meeting on January 23rd, substituting it with the following suggestion: "The Shanghai Municipal Council should continue to implement administrative streamlining and conduct a fundamental study on the possibility of reforming the existing tax system. The proportion of taxes borne should be determined based on the ability of each citizen, replacing the current system of obtaining most of the tax revenue from land tax and municipal rates, so that the tax system is fairer. Until such a system can be realized, the financial shortfall should be made up by borrowing." This proposal was not accepted by the general meeting. The proposer, Lin Xiongji, became enraged and shot Keswick, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, causing him injury. The tax increase proposal, which was about to pass, could not be completed.</p>
<p>Tax Increase Proposal Likely to Pass</p>
<p>The general meeting has now been scheduled to reconvene on the 5th. Generally speaking, the tax increase proposal will likely pass with a majority due to the support of British and American taxpayers. The Japanese side then attempted to create a situation where the meeting could not proceed by not attending. Therefore, the Japanese side convened a meeting of the standing committees of various road associations on the 29th, and a joint meeting of the standing committee members and councilors of the taxpayers' association on the 30th, and successively decided that Japanese taxpayers would refuse to attend the meeting on the 5th. However, given the significance of the matter, a general meeting of taxpayers was held at the Japanese Club on Peng Road at 1:00 PM yesterday to make a final decision. The attitude of the Japanese side is attracting attention from both Chinese and foreign individuals.</p>
<p>Japanese Decide to Oppose</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency, despite the attacks from various parties, the Japanese side made a final decision yesterday to refuse to participate in the meeting convened on the 5th to show their firm opposition to the tax increase proposal. If the Japanese proposal cannot be implemented, they will refuse to participate in future meetings.</p>
<p>New Arrangements Made at the Meeting Venue</p>
<p>Although the Japanese side has given assurances that there will be no more unfortunate incidents at the next Special Ratepayers' Meeting, the authorities have made strict arrangements at the Race Course meeting venue as a precaution. There are now several White Russian members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed at each entrance and exit of the meeting venue, patrolling the surroundings from time to time. Although there is currently nothing inside, both Chinese and foreign individuals are strictly prohibited from entering. However, a reporter heard from someone who had been to the meeting venue that new arrangements have been made on the aisle between the podium and the taxpayers' seats to prevent crowds from rushing to the podium.</p>
<p>Foreign Media Commentary</p>
<p>Yesterday's English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" commented on the Japanese residents' refusal to attend the Taxpayers' Meeting, stating that the Japanese residents of this city seem to have decided to become the world's number one "crying baby" and inferior athletes. We suggested yesterday that the Japanese authorities in this city should require their nationals to attend next Wednesday's meeting. If they can attend the meeting and behave like gentlemen and ladies, it would at least prove that they do not endorse Lin Xiongji's illegal actions. However, they seem to disdain doing so, preferring not to attend the meeting, making others believe that the Japanese residents cannot abide by legal procedures.</p>
<h3>Another Periodical Lottery for Government Bonds - Confidence Grows Stronger</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee, upon order, is conducting the eleventh lottery for principal repayment of the 25th Year of the Republic (1936) Unified Government Bonds.

A total of 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9.741 million yuan in interest, totaling 11.441 million yuan in principal and interest, will be repaid. The current outstanding debt is 32.47 million yuan.</p>

The outstanding debt is 28.125 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Sale of Flour at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Continues from the 3rd</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of flour at reduced prices, after repeated negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills, starting next Monday (the 3rd), Fuxin will supply 5,873 bags and Fufeng will supply 1,059 bags daily (except Sundays). The factory price is 23 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao, totaling 23.3 yuan per bag. Users can collect flour from the original distribution points starting from the 3rd. However, due to a slight shortage in the supply from the two factories, users are only allowed to collect flour on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of each week (no flour is distributed on Wednesday and Sunday). As for foreign flour recently and to be shipped to Shanghai, if its quality is the same as the local No. 2 flour, one-tenth will still be extracted for reduced-price sale according to the method decided in the previous year's consultation. The selling price is the same as the newly determined local factory price, which is 23 yuan per bag (49 pounds). After a sufficient quantity has accumulated, it will be sold to general genuine users through various flour distributors.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of American Nationals Return to Their Country on Schedule</h3>
<p>Mr. Canna also Departs Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that a large-scale withdrawal of American nationals from China has been ongoing in recent months and has yet to cease. Another batch of approximately 25 to 30 American nationals in Shanghai has booked tickets on the President Cleveland and is scheduled to depart around February 8th. This includes several prominent American nationals, such as Mr. Canna, the recently resigned Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. Canna previously served as the manager of the Standard Oil Company in this city. This is not a "withdrawal" but merely a trip back to the country. Others, such as Mr. and Mrs. Bailey, the manager of Yunfei Automobile Company, are withdrawing to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Extremely Cold Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>More Than Five Degrees Below Freezing</p>
<p>Due to the Siberian High-Pressure System affecting Shanghai, the temperature in this city has been very cold for several days. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the temperature in this city was even colder at dawn yesterday, reaching 23.3 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 5.4 degrees below freezing, almost freezing water into ice. This is an unprecedented record for this cold season. The temperature only began to warm up after sunrise. The high-pressure system in this city and the Yangtze River region is expected to move away after today, and the temperature should return to warmth.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army in this city has now begun fundraising 175,000 yuan in national currency to continue its charitable work. The majority of the funds raised will be used for Chinese affairs. Over 38,000 yuan has already been raised. A certain Chinese merchant, admiring the work of the Salvation Army, has donated 10,000 yuan in national currency alone. The Salvation Army annually provides relief to no fewer than several thousand Chinese prisoners released from prisons.

<p>The second completed world-class new ship of the American President Lines, the President Monroe, will arrive in port on the 5th of this month. After anchoring here for one night, it will set sail the next day, passing through Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and India, around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and across the Atlantic Ocean to return to New York.

<h3>Telegram from London - Reduced Insurance Rate</h3>
<p>All Countries Closely Protect Shipping - Maritime Transport is Now Safer</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, various countries have levied wartime marine insurance fees due to unrest at sea. Now, due to the close protection of shipping by various countries, sea voyages are somewhat safer. The shipping industry in this city has now received notice from London to reduce wartime marine insurance rates. Except for the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, where the war is raging, which will remain at the original rates, all other routes will be reduced. The rate from Shanghai via Panama to various parts of South, Central, and North America has been reduced from 1 5/8 percent to 1 1/2 percent. The rate to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope has also been reduced from 4 1/2 percent to 4 percent. The rate from Shanghai to India has been reduced from 3 percent to 2 1/2 percent, and the same applies to ships to the Persian Gulf.</p>

<h3>Orphanage Dismisses Employees - Another Labor Dispute Erupts - Many of Those Dismissed Were Leaders of the Employees - Strong Emotions Lead to Destruction of Factory Machines</h3>
<p>Over 300 employees of the Xujiahui Tushanwan Orphanage were informed on the 31st of last month that the orphanage was dismissing one-third of them for "cost-saving purposes," leading to strong emotions and another strike. According to the employees, the dismissal was a violation of the agreement recently reached between labor and management at the orphanage to resolve the labor dispute. Many of the dismissed employees were leaders during the strike, and the orphanage had promised not to dismiss them.</p>
<p>Dispute Escalates - No Negotiations Yet</p>
<p>It is reported that the orphanage has forbidden employees from entering, but some employees have climbed over low walls into the orphanage and damaged machines in the orphanage's factory. It is also reported that the strikers have applied to the "City" authorities to send someone to mediate. At the same time, a large number of police officers are stationed around the orphanage, and the entrance is completely closed. It is reported that no negotiations have been conducted to resolve the dispute. The strikers have refuted the orphanage's claim that the dismissal of employees was for cost-saving purposes. They claim that the orphanage's income is sufficient to maintain the employees in the orphanage's factory.</p>
<p>Other Labor Disputes Can Be Resolved</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post" also reports that the labor dispute at the Park Hotel, which has lasted for several days, is reportedly about to be resolved as the management has agreed to pay each employee a bonus of 25 yuan and increase wages. The workers are satisfied, and the labor dispute has been resolved. As for the painters' strike, the employers have agreed to increase daily wages to 2.5 yuan, but the painters are still demanding 3.4 yuan per day. The two sides are still negotiating and are expected to reach a peaceful resolution in the near future. Most of the staff of other commercial establishments who demanded pay raises have now returned to work as usual. The labor and management of the Chackering Bakery and the Commercial Press have reached an understanding and resumed work. The main labor dispute at present is at the Guangci Hospital. The hospital first agreed to the employees' demands and then dismissed several people, leading to another strike by the employees. The two sides have not conducted any negotiations since the Lunar New Year, so the situation remains deadlocked.</p>
<h3>Elderly Indian Man, Ill for a Long Time, Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building Out of Weariness of Life</h3>
<p>Samta Sinjh, an Indian man, 50 years old, was previously hospitalized at the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road due to illness. After more than half a month, his condition had not improved, causing him great suffering. He suddenly had the thought of committing suicide, and yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, he went up to the third floor alone and jumped from the window, killing himself instantly on Tiantong Road. When a hospital worker entered the room for some matter and discovered that Samta Sinjh was missing, he reported it to the hospital, which searched for him and found him lying stiffly on the side of the road. He was cold to the touch. The hospital reported it to the police, who transported the body to the coroner's office. The British Consulate sent personnel to examine the body before it was buried.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Gathering to Gamble</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Feng Baishun and Hua Head Constable Lu Dagong of the Putuo Road Police Station, having learned that someone was running a gambling den at No. 8, Lane 340, Macau Road, Shanghai West, and gathering people to gamble, collaborated with Detectives Kong Guangxiao and Wang Yongjun and others at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday to secretly raid the place and arrest over 40 people, including Wang Xianting, Wang Jinting, Wu Xiaoshuang, and Wang Xiaoting. They were taken to the police station along with gambling equipment and chips. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qiqi, filed a lawsuit according to law. Judge Meng interrogated them and sentenced Wang Xianting to five months in prison and a fine of 300 yuan. Wang Jinting was sentenced to two months in prison. The remaining Wang Xiaoting and others were each fined. The gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Public Rickshaw Pullers to Renew Licenses Changed</h3>
<p>Because the licenses for public rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession have expired, the Municipal Council has begun to process the renewal of new licenses last month. The measures this time have been changed more than last year. (1) In the past, each rickshaw was registered for four people (there were 9,500 licensed rickshaws, so 38,000 people were registered each time). Now, it has been changed to three people per rickshaw (because four rickshaws were suspended for violating regulations, the total number of rickshaws is now only 9,496, and the number of registered people has been changed to 28,488). (2) In the past, rickshaw pullers were required to pull the rickshaw at least 15 shifts per month to get their licenses. Now, it has been changed to at least 20 shifts per month to be eligible for a license. This registration ends on February 26. If the quota of 28,488 people is not met by the deadline, new rickshaw pullers will be registered starting March 10 until the quota is reached. If new licenses are not obtained by April, they will not be allowed to continue pulling rickshaws.</p>
<h3>French Concession - Ambulance Service Fees</h3>

After his confession, they went to Room 115, Tiren Hospital, No. 1325, Route Lafayette, in the French Concession, and arrested the gang leader, Wu Zhenjia from Pudong (also known as Liu Baigui, residing at No. 43, Daodeli, Route Foch), and his mistress, Chen Hongmei from Haimen, as well as Shen Laiyi from Pudong, seizing 3,144 yuan in legal tender. They then waited there and arrested Wang Rende (also known as Jiang Hengmao, also known as Jiaju) from Pudong. Later, Li Shixiang and Le A'gen from Ningbo drove Car No. 1532 to the scene and were also arrested. It was found that the car belonged to a certain Commander Ding, and Li and Le were his drivers. Then, at Le A'gen's home at No. 104, Lane 179, Route Maqi, Le Wu's mother was arrested and 90 US dollars in bills were seized. All were taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>Ransom Amounts for Each Case</p>
<p>Under investigation, they confessed to having committed four kidnapping cases: (1) Kidnapping Shen Jinzhou, owner of the Yitaixing Coal Company, extorting a ransom of 600,000 yuan; (2) Kidnapping Sun Zhizhai, owner of the Huizhong Inn on Hankou Road, obtaining a ransom of 350,000 yuan; (3) Kidnapping Yu Mou, owner of the Lixin Weaving Factory on Sichuan Road, obtaining a ransom of 150,000 yuan; (4) Kidnapping Shen Zhongfang, a pediatrician and national medicine doctor, obtaining a partial ransom of 55,000 yuan before the police cracked the case. The total ransom for the above four cases was 1,155,000 yuan. Wu Zhenjia, Ma Jisen, and Wang Rende among the arrested criminals were the main perpetrators in each of the kidnapping cases.</p>
<p>Case Transfer - Interrogation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process and requested permission for temporary detention pending further investigation and prosecution. When Wu Zhenjia, Ma Jisen, and Wang Rende were questioned, they all confessed to participating in the kidnapping cases. According to the police, Wang Rende had also attempted to kidnap Mr. Zheng, the owner of Car No. 730, Weihaiwei Road, but failed. Wu Zhenjia and Wang Rende hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, he ordered all the criminals to be returned to detention for further questioning in two weeks.</p>
<h3>The Great Value Copper Ingots Theft Case - American Assessor's Office Will Begin Trial - Mao Sheng Foreign Firm Sues Ruifeng Transportation Company - Demands Compensation for All Losses and Legal Costs</h3>
<p>According to sources from authoritative circles yesterday, the case of Mao Sheng Foreign Firm suing Ruifeng Transportation Company will be tried by Assessor Helmick in the American Assessor's Office on February 11. At that time, the main personnel of both companies will appear in court. The case has been described as "the largest fraud case in Shanghai's history" and has attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people. There will be a tense situation at the trial.</p>
<p>Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, the Plaintiff</p>
<p>Is suing the defendant for negligence, which resulted in the theft of copper ingots and other metal materials stored in the Ruifeng Transportation Company's warehouse, valued at US$175,077.69 (equivalent to 3 million legal tender), by a Russian national, Whert, and a Chinese employee of the company. The defendant claims that they cannot be held responsible for the losses because the losses occurred as a result of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Stored Goods</p>
<p>Are currently detained by the Japanese military and other Japanese agencies. The defendant also stated that in addition to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, a certain party also claimed to be the owner of the goods and demanded compensation for the losses. The case occurred several years ago when Mao Sheng Foreign Firm and other American companies sold coin minting machines to the Chinese government. The Chinese government exchanged copper coins and copper ingots in return. These copper ingots were stored in the Ruifeng Company's warehouse. Several months ago, it was suddenly discovered that</p>
<p>The Copper Ingots Were Stolen</p>
<p>The wooden boxes storing 3 million yuan worth of copper ingots had been replaced with sand, stones, and cement slabs. On October 10 last year, Whert was arrested by the Police Department in the Broadway Building. The news of the giant theft case was then released. However, a large number of Japanese military police in trucks arrived within minutes and released Whert. Whert later told people that he was working for the Japanese government and that the copper coins were "contraband." His actions were merely</p>
<p>Acting on Behalf of the Japanese</p>
<p>"Performing his duties." Well-informed sources claimed yesterday that at the trial, Mao Sheng Foreign Firm will demand that the defendant pay US$175,077.69 and interest since September 20 last year, as well as bear the litigation costs and attorneys' fees.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in the Astronomical Community</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) According to the report of the current annual meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society, although the domestic astronomical community has been displaced and relocated in recent years, work has not been interrupted. The main points of the work in various areas are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The National Central Research Institute's Astronomical Research Institute has moved repeatedly since the war, from Nanjing to Changsha, Guilin, and Kunming. It has not had a stable base for two years. Because there is no astronomical observatory with equipment, the main focus is on整理the organization of past observation records and calculation work. Recently, a site has been selected in Kunming to build an astronomical observatory and install instruments for observation. Solar spectrometers, variable star instruments, and solar eclipse research have gradually resumed. Preparations are currently underway for the observation of the solar eclipse visible in China in the 30th year of the Republic (1941). Regarding the timing, the national calendars for the 28th and 29th years (1939 and 1940) were all compiled by the institute. Furthermore, in accordance with the spirit of the Standard Time Conference convened by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, a book of illustrations of Chinese standard time zones has been compiled and submitted to the ministry. Other work, such as calculating sunrise and sunset tables for the Aviation Committee and predicting the time and azimuth of the eclipse at important locations within the path of totality, as well as measuring their longitude and latitude, is difficult and important.</p>
<p>(2) National Sun Yat-sen University: The school initially established an astronomical department in the 15th year of the Republic (1926). The mathematics department was expanded into a mathematics and astronomy department. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the astronomical observatory was established, allowing for practical observation. Publications include the two-month journal that continued to be published until volume 7. Other books, such as Higher Astronomy, Research Methods for Variable Stars, General Astronomy, and the Collection of National Meteorological Proverbs, are mostly the result of the authors' research. Later, due to the outbreak of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the fall of Guangzhou, the school moved to Luoding, Chengjiang, and other places and decided to build a simple observatory in Chengjiang. At present, students' astronomical practice is carried out as usual without hindrance. They are able to use simple methods to perform tasks such as drawing solar sunspot projections, visually observing variable stars, and making preliminary determinations of the latitude of Chengjiang.</p>
<p>(3) Land Surveying General Bureau: (A) In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), due to the impact of the August 13th Incident, the internal work of the bureau's astronomical observatory was suspended, but external operations continued. Fourteen points along the path of totality for the solar eclipse in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) were measured for longitude and latitude. Seven points were in Jiangxi Province, including De'an, Xingzi, Poyang, Duchang, Wannian, Yiyang, and Qianshan. Seven points were in Hubei Province, including Heshengqiao, Jinkou, Tianmen, Hanchuan, Zhongxiang, Lexiangguan, and Wuan Yan. Regarding geodetic surveying calculations and applications, seven first-order points were measured in Ningbo, Kanmen, Changsha, Liuzhou, and Ganzhou. (B) In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the bureau sent personnel to measure astronomical points in important areas due to military needs: (1) From Changde via Chongqing and Guiyang to Chengdu, two first-order points were measured in Guiyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu, and nine second-order points were measured in Changde, Zunyi, and Songkan. (2) From Hengyang via Liuzhou and Guiyang to Kunming, three first-order points were measured in Hengyang, Liuzhou, and Kunming, and ten second-order points were measured in Qiyang, Hechi, Anshun, Panxian, and Malong. (3) In the western Hunan region, five second-order points were measured in Shaoyang, Xinhua, Dongkou, Chengbu, and Chaling. In Guizhou Province, four second-order points were measured in Wuzhou, Nanning, Mingjiang, and Baise. (C) In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), plans were made to measure astronomical points in the provinces of Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, and Guizhou, to build a simple observatory in Pingba, and to measure the constants and longitude and latitude of the new meridian instrument. In the future, it is planned to advance further into Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang in order to distribute astronomical points of all levels throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Guangxia Elementary and Middle School Teachers and Staff Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Related parties are making every effort to mediate</p>
<p>Three demands to be answered tomorrow</p>
<p>According to reports from the Dahua News Agency, teachers and staff at the private Guangxia Elementary and Middle School, located at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Moore Road in this city, are demanding improved treatment. It is understood that education officials have dispatched personnel to mediate this brewing unfortunate incident. Both the teachers and staff and the school authorities have been able to communicate frankly and accept mediation, and the situation is not serious and should be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Teachers' Demands</p>
<p>The Guangxia teachers and staff have selected four representatives to present the following demands to the school authorities: (1) Review the school's past financial situation and disclose future financial accounts; (2) Pay salaries based on six months per semester; (3) Allocate increased tuition fees to increase salaries for teachers and staff. However, the school authorities' response has failed to satisfy the teachers and staff, leading to a stalemate and even brewing strike action.</p>
<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, education officials immediately dispatched personnel yesterday morning to mediate. They met separately with the school's teacher representatives, including Ge Shixiong, Director of Documents in the Middle School Department; Gong Lunchao, Deputy Director of Guidance; Zhang Naicong, Director of Guidance in the Elementary School Department; Zhu Jichu, Sixth Grade Homeroom Teacher; and school representatives, including Principal Lu Xirong and Director of Guidance Wang [Name Omitted]. They discussed peaceful resolution methods. Both sides were very kind and able to be sincere and discuss matters tactfully. Therefore, the situation has improved, and the strike action should be averted. The school has also scheduled to formally respond to the teachers and staff's demands tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Zhijiang Civil School Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Tan Tiankai took charge of the Education Department of Zhijiang University, the department has achieved remarkable results. Adhering to the principle of serving society and eliminating illiteracy, the Education Department students have been using their spare time to run a public night school. Since its establishment two years ago, thanks to the dedication of the teachers and the exemption of tuition and miscellaneous fees, the number of apprentices and out-of-school children from nearby shops has been increasing daily, now reaching over 300 people. It is also reported that in order to commemorate the achievements of the past two years, the school will hold a student coursework achievement exhibition at 4:00 PM on the first and second of this month on the fourth floor, room 409 of the Cishu Building. The exhibition will feature many excellent student works, as the school authorities not only focus on basic subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics but also provide enlightenment in calligraphy, art, and music.</p>
<h3>New Construction and Expansion of Science Equipment</h3>
<p>The New Construction Middle School, which has been specially approved by the Ministry of Education, has a reputation in Shanghai for its serious teaching and strict management. Starting next semester, it has decided to discontinue the high school business program and devote all its efforts to the development of the general high school program. In addition to dividing the general high school program into arts and science groups and hiring renowned teachers who have graduated from schools such as Shanghai, Jiaotong, Jinling, and Daxia for many years, the school is now extensively expanding its equipment, adding physics and chemistry instruments and microscopes worth more than 5,600 yuan. The laboratory is also being set up. The school's winter break enrollment was extremely popular in the previous round, with only 140 students being admitted, about one-half of the total applicants. Currently, because there are still a few vacancies in each class, a second entrance examination has been scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 4th of this month at 310 Sima Road. Many people have been applying recently.</p>
<h3>School News Summary</h3>
<p>Chengming College: The Chengming College Business Vocational Program in this city has hired Wu Yanrong, a British Certified Public Accountant and Doctor of Economics, to teach Commercial Foreign Language, and Wang Yanhao, Director of the Banking Preparatory Committee in this city, to teach Banking Accounting.

<h3>Methods and Joys of Reading</h3>
<p>— Yan Ling</p>
<p>When you see someone riding a bicycle, speeding past you like lightning, how envious you must be! But when you get on, you fall down. Why? When you see someone moving in the swimming pool, as agile and free as a fish, how envious you must be! But when you enter the water, you feel restricted. Why? The answer is simply two words: "method." One knows the "method," the other doesn't. Therefore, "method" is the key to all treasures.</p>
<p>Why do some people learn to ride a bicycle and swim with less time and effort? And why do some people spend a lot of time and effort? The answer is also simply two words: "method." Therefore, "method" is the driving force for learning everything.</p>
<p>Why do some people enjoy doing things more and more, while others fear doing things more and more? The answer is also simply two words: "method." Therefore, "method" is the source of all joy.</p>
<p>In society, no job can do without "method." It seems that social evolution is also a progression of "method." In the past, it was handicrafts, producing few and inferior products. Now, it is machine industry, producing more and better products. This is also a progression of "method."</p>
<p>Reading is the same. Reading without "method" is rote learning. Reading with "method" is active learning. With the method of reading, knowledge will progress.</p>
<p>As for joy, it is the soul of life. Life cannot be without joy. With joy, life has value. If you spend decades with a crying face, then life becomes a desert, what is the use of it?</p>
<p>In most people's minds, "joy" can only be found in playing, and nowhere else. In fact, this is a huge mistake, because "joy" is everywhere. Like the children, who are now reading, they can also find "joy" in books. Children must say after hearing my words: "That's not right, the homework we do is very difficult, what 'joy' is there to find?"</p>
<p>Ha, children! You really have the wrong idea that there is no "joy" to be found in books. When you see books, you hate them. No wonder your homework hasn't improved. You must know that to make great progress in homework, you have to break through many difficulties. If you see difficulties and don't break through them, but instead avoid them, then you will naturally only have troubles and not get joy. On the other hand, if you read with an attitude of joy and fight the difficulties you encounter, when you overcome the difficulties and your reading has improved, don't you feel happy? That is where you find the "joy" from reading.</p>
<p>If you have "joy" in reading, then of course you can overcome the difficulties of reading.</p>
<h3>Balloon</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year follows the Gregorian New Year. The New Year is a gift for children, they look forward to celebrating the New Year every day and night. During these few days of the New Year, eating and playing are the two most important things, and their parents don't interfere, letting them play and eat their fill as much as possible. Therefore, the New Year can be said to be the children's New Year. A Liang is a child, of course, no exception, often pulling his father to the street to play, and he always brings one or two toys in his hands when he comes back. One day his father bought him a flying red balloon. Of course, he was overjoyed. Seeing that a good red rubber ball, why can it float in the air and not fall down, while other things thrown up will always fall down, what is the reason? He asked his father this question.</p>
<p>His father was very happy to answer: "Because this red rubber ball is filled with a gas that is lighter than anything else. So we call this gas light gas. It is fourteen and a half times lighter than air, so it can float in the air and not fall down. Other things thrown up will fall down, even a very light chicken feather is like this, because these things are heavier than air, so they will fall down!"</p>
<p>"Then Dad, can you let out the light gas inside for me to see?" A Liang still asked, not quite understanding.</p>
<p>"Silly child, light gas is a colorless, odorless, invisible, and intangible thing, what's there to see?" His father said with a smile in his heart. A Liang walked away without saying anything after hearing that his father would not grant his request. But even though he was holding a balloon in his hand, he wanted to take out the light gas to see it clearly, because he didn't quite believe what his father said. So he secretly took a pair of scissors and cut off the string tied to the mouth of the balloon. He opened his eyes wide, wanting to see the monster inside the balloon clearly. But when he let go of his hand gently, he only heard a hissing sound, and nothing else happened, but he saw that the balloon deflated instantly. Only then did he believe that what his father said was true. Later, his father knew about it, but he didn't blame him. So he became bolder and asked his father again: "Dad, since light gas is invisible and intangible, how do we know that there is such a gas?" "Although light gas is elusive, it has its own characteristics. It can burn itself and can also combine with oxygen to form water." A Liang still didn't quite believe it, so his father bought another balloon and put the light gas inside into an inverted glass. He lit a match and pointed it at the mouth of the glass, and he saw that the mouth of the glass was also on fire. Only then did A Liang suddenly realize, and he was even more grateful to his father for taking the trouble to show him. So he firmly remembered it in his heart.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Students' Summer Homework Competition Preliminary Round, Sixth Place: My Father</h3>
<p>— Nv Qingnian, Hui Yi Elementary School, Zhang Xiqiu</p>
<p>I know from my mother's mouth: My father lived in the countryside when he was young. When he was seven or eight years old, he was very naughty. He often destroyed the plants planted by others, and he also beat and scolded people. People called him a nasty child.</p>
<p>My father entered school at the age of nine. He received a very good education at school, so his conduct, manners, etc. were all very good. He was also often praised by the villagers. My father was very happy in his heart, so he studied even harder. Because my father studied hard, he was always first in every semester.</p>
<p>After graduating from elementary school, my father stopped going to school, just because his grandfather was sick at that time, not only could he not earn money, but no one farmed the fields, so there was no food at home. From then on, my father had to help his grandmother farm the fields.</p>
<p>My father grew to his thirties in a difficult and hard life. Because there were more people in the family, he could no longer survive in the countryside. So, he came to Shanghai to look for a living. My father first sold vegetables, and then went to Suzhou to sell vegetables. After spending two years there, he returned to Shanghai and worked as a handyman in a hotel.</p>
<p>My father is now working in the Shanghai Public Welfare Factory, earning only more than twenty yuan a month in wages, but there are seven people in the family, how is that enough? So he often does some trading in his spare time—taking some old goods from others to sell—My mother saw that my father was too tired, so she said: "Let the children do some work." My father said: "Now is still the time for them to study, don't delay them, I can still suffer, suffer a little more." Alas! God! These words are full of love and bitterness. Every time I hear my mother say it, I always shed tears. My father has to maintain the family's livelihood, so after doing his day job, he still has to do his night job. After a few days like this, my father could no longer support himself and fell ill. After being sick for two days, the family's livelihood was in trouble again! My father looked at our family, big and small, going hungry, crying and arguing. He could no longer bear it. He could only support his weak and sick body and borrowed money from friends, bought dozens of novels and candies, and sat by the roadside to sell them. In this way, he earned a little money, and our family was able to cook some porridge to eat.</p>
<p>Fortunately, God blesses us, my father's illness is cured, and we can still live a hard life.</p>
<p>My father likes children very much. He usually plays with us very kindly, but if we make him angry, he will glare his eyes, his face will turn red, and he will scold us angrily. Sometimes he will even hit us!</p>
<p>In his spare time, my father often tells us about the painful experiences of many famous people when they were young, and encourages us to pay attention to our character and our studies. My father is really the best father, worthy of my respect and blessing.</p>
<h3>How to Use Lucky Money</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is a season when many children have the most abundant income—lucky money! Some are given by grandparents, some are given by parents, some are given by relatives, close relatives, and friends of their parents. The amount is at least two yuan, four yuan, six yuan, and some even have ten yuan, twenty yuan, wrapped in red envelopes with auspicious phrases such as "May you be blessed every year," "May you have peace every year," and "May you live long and prosper." Such colorful and golden characters cater to children's psychology and arouse their interest. In bourgeois families, lucky children generally have considerable income from lucky money, some with dozens of yuan, and some even with hundreds of yuan, up to nearly a thousand yuan; while children in poor families are already happy and dancing when they receive lucky money of four cents or one yuan from their parents. Like my group of children, every year on New Year's Eve, they are given two cents of lucky money. Everyone smiles, knowing that it is not easy to come by, and they are unwilling to waste a penny. They all give it to their mother to save up for school supplies. This is what my wife and I, as parents, approve of them. According to the origin of "lucky money," in the old custom, every year on New Year's Eve or the beginning of the year, elders give lucky money to young children, using red strings to string copper coins, hundreds of them, taking the meaning of "hundred years," which is the parents' good wishes for the children. At present, there are many refugee children and poor children wandering in the streets, whose fathers and mothers have died in the cruel artillery fire! I hope that the blessed children will quickly donate their lucky money to help the needy. Or use it to help the "poor student loan" and "small business loan," helping poor out-of-school friends and shoulder-carrying vendors who are struggling to survive. That is truly immeasurable merit!</p>

<h3>Jenny MacDonald's Advice to Singers</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Jenny MacDonald, this great singing star, has fascinated countless movie fans and music fans all over the world. Her musical films, such as "The Merry Widow," "Rose Marie," and the latest "Sweethearts," have left a deep impression on people's minds; her songs are also popular in every corner of the world. The reason why she has been so warmly welcomed and has been able to maintain such a high honor to this day is, of course, due to her constant efforts, patience, and self-confidence.</p>
<p>"Now is the most brilliant period of artistic development in the United States." This star once said to young musicians in the United States.</p>
<p>"The generation of young artists in the United States is so lucky!" She went on to tell them, "Two years ago, Americans had to study music properly and had to go to Europe. There, both music and singing were much more advanced than in the United States; but now, the situation is very different. In our own home, we can already discover many geniuses, which seemed simply impossible in the past."</p>
<p>MacDonald has a great hope for these rising stars. She hopes that they will succeed in becoming the best musicians, movie stars, and singing stars in the near future. Every day, she can find hundreds of letters in her small mailbox, all written by young musicians asking her for "experience" and "knowledge."</p>
<p>"I always try my best not to disappoint them;" she said, "but they all seem to have a very big shortcoming. That is: they lack patience too much. They lack patience in work, in hard work, and in practice. This is not a problem in some aspects; but in music and singing, you must never 'change your mind' and 'start something and then give up.' Impatience will make us lose all the little achievements we have gained from hard work; a musician or a singer must go through numerous trials and head-down practice before taking the stage, otherwise, the result will definitely be a complete failure.</p>
<p>"Lack of patience means not being willing to work hard with your head down. As a result, it is like a flower bud that is about to bloom being brutally destroyed. We only know how to 'show off' but don't know how to learn. We are single-minded in wanting to take the stage but don't know how to consolidate our foundation; so failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>"We want our art to progress, we want to expand our talents, we must work hard! We must be patient!" MacDonald's final advice is like this.</p>
<p>In fact, not only singing is like this, but everything is like this. If we want to achieve true success, we should not ignore this advice given to us by MacDonald.</p>
<h3>A Scene from Sweethearts</h3>
<h3>Hu Die Resumes Screen Life, to Star in "Peacock Flies Southeast" in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the Incident, Hu Die immediately left Shanghai for Hong Kong. Originally, after the filming of "Peerless Beauty," she did not intend to make any more films, and there were rumors that she would go to Manila, which later proved to be inaccurate. Now, news has come that she will resume her screen life in Hong Kong, and the film she is scheduled to shoot is "Peacock Flies Southeast," a famous work in Peking Opera.</p>

<h3>Robert Montgomery's Success (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Stie</p>
<p>Gained Status Through "The Masked Man"; First Silver Screen Appearance Was a Collaboration with Garbo</p>
<p>Fiery Ambition</p>
<p>After his triumph on Broadway, under the guidance of the renowned producer Edgar Selwyn, he starred in the notoriously difficult play "Possession." Selwyn, at this time, had aspirations for developing his film career, and thus Robert Montgomery was drawn to Hollywood, still yearning for his future. His first appearance on the silver screen was in "Inspiration," starring Greta Garbo. More recent works include "The Earl of Chicago" and the British detective drama "Haunted Honeymoon," the latter of which has not been released locally. His weekly salary at MGM was 7,500 gold dollars, more than Clark Gable. He made a total of 55 films for MGM, and his 56th was just completed, titled "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith," with Carole Lombard as the female lead. In the memories of Shanghai residents, "Fiery Ambition" is perhaps his most moving work, a film that has been repeatedly shown and continues to be a box office success.</p>
<p>Serving in France</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the European War, the film industry was in turmoil. Many British and French male stars returned home to enlist in the military. Although Robert Montgomery had no such obligation, his blood was also stirred, and he went to France to serve the Allied forces as an ambulance driver. With the fall of France and the end of the war in French territory, he had nothing to do and returned home. Back in the United States, he resumed his position as president of the "People's Association," traveling around giving speeches and campaigning for Wilkie for president. His political speeches were very powerful, unlike the usual Hollywood figures who had no understanding of such matters, although the third term president Roosevelt defeated Wilkie. Finally, we should talk about his family situation. His wife, Betty Allen, once appeared on the silver screen. They have a son and a daughter, living harmoniously, and are considered one of the happiest families among film stars. He is a heavy drinker, and his villa has a perfectly equipped wine bar. James Cagney is a frequent guest. Montgomery intends to switch to directing, but he still remembers the certificate he obtained when he was working on oil tankers, because he is qualified to be a sailor!</p>
<h3>Tao Lengyue Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Tao Lengyue, a famous contemporary Chinese painter, once served as an art professor at various universities. He is able to integrate Chinese and Western styles, synthesize the ancient and the modern, to create a type of work that is both symbolic and imbued with charm, transcending the confines of the Four Wangs, Wu, and Yun. Viewing his work evokes in the viewer's mind and heart a wonderful and inexplicable feeling, as if one has arrived on another planet, where all obstacles are cleared, and all things possess a sense of rejuvenation. This kind of magic surpasses any form of entertainment. Recently, he has accumulated the results of a certain period and is exhibiting 300 pieces at the Daxin Department Store's fourth floor. At the same time, the renowned scholar Jiang Yinqiu from Wuzhong has created dozens of couplets, some in seal script, some in clerical script, mostly composed of phrases from Song Dynasty poetry. The elegant韵 is particularly evident. It is said that the couplet paper is from the Qianlong era, beautiful and exquisite. Lovers of calligraphy and painting should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>"Old Stupid Dog's Hungry Days" to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cartoon Society, formerly known as the Student Cartoon Society, has now completed its first short cartoon film, approximately 800 feet long. All the animation frames were drawn by experts, with voice acting by Chen Geshen. New cameras which were self made were used to record the film. The film was recently screened at the Jindu Theater, and the results were satisfactory. It will be released soon. It is said that the second production will be a full-length film with a Chinese background.</p>
<p>"Midnight," a world-renowned play written by Liao Kangfu and translated by Ba Jin, will be grandly performed by the "Qingmei Drama Troupe." The director is Xia Feng, and the cast includes Murong Wan'er, Yan Jun, Wang Jixu, Wei Jin, and others. It is said that the troupe is currently working hard in rehearsals and will soon give its national premiere in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>The Hezhong Film Company went to great lengths to bring Ying Yin from Chongqing to Shanghai, originally to have her star in "Empress Dowager Cixi." However, "Empress Dowager Cixi" has not yet started filming due to its large scale. In the meantime, she unexpectedly starred in "Sai Jinhua," and the results were not bad; her acting was even praised. Recently, Hezhong's production line has changed slightly from before and is preparing for large-scale production. The first film, "Xue Yan Niang," has already been completed. Thus, there are rumors outside that "Empress Dowager Cixi" will soon begin filming. According to this writer, this rumor is not very reliable, for no other reason than "Empress Dowager Cixi" is a major production. However, it is possible that Ying Yin will star in another film soon. It is said that this time it will be a contemporary drama, and the script was provided to the company by Ying Yin herself.</p>
<p>The Zhongqing Drama Society will perform "Thunderstorm" at the Lyceum Theatre on the evenings of the 4th and 5th of this month. On the evening of the 3rd at 8:00 PM, there will be a preview performance, "requesting the presence and guidance of all circles." The purpose of this performance is to "raise donations for porridge for the poor," making it a charity performance. The script for this performance has been retranslated by Fang Xin, and it is said that it surpasses previous translations in terms of both "faithfulness" and "expressiveness." The director of the play is also Fang Xin.</p>
<p>The preparation for Minhua's "Song of Ancient China" which will begin filming on the 3rd of this month are actively underway under the joint design of Zhang Hanchen, Chen Shaozhou, and Mu Yilong. This preparation, in the area of Peking opera, will strive for pictorial beauty, since Peking opera has no way of being realistic, and the costumes, makeup, and movements all contain a pictorial meaning. In order to achieve harmony, a pictorial approach is deemed appropriate.</p>
