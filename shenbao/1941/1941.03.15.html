<h3 id="c5">二屆日光節約運動之舉行 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日前工部局通吿又將舉行二屆日光節的運動，定於今日實行。昨日本報載有讀者之書面意見，認爲在工廠工人方面有窒礙難行處，是必得之於已往經歷，故知其爲不便。惟工部局旣已通告施行，上海電力公司復呼應於後，能吾使工部局尊重民意，重行考慮，抑或說亦徒然，此在其未有表示前，無從憶測。惟事關行政者，無論其爲國，爲市，均以人民福利爲依歸，其有不便於民者則罷除之。故同一囤貨，而獨於米糧粉麥油豆之居奇，引起社會輿論之忿懣不平者，正以其妨害人民最大福利，有危及其生存權利之虞也。夫爲人民興利除害，改善生活，保障安全，則爲善政。反之，事無其必要性，而於一般生活行動有其拘束性者，縱小得謂之非法桎梏，亦不得謂之合理行爲，蓋合理也者，合於入情法律自然之埋則也。今舉行日光節的運動，旨在提早一小時工作，提早一小時公畢，甚或爲提早一小時消遣娛樂之時間。實際上，工作時間無所增减，故亦無所謂節的。早年之在夏日，亦有提早一小時工作者，是則僅爲適應氣候人情之自然舉動；蓋夏日多早起，亭午苦酷熱。熱則工作易倦，辦事之效率减低；晨則氣候溫凉，人淸氣爽；於是有在上午則提早一二小時辦公，在下午則减少一二小時工作，甚至下午停公亦有之，視其事業之情况而定，固非行之以政令，不强迫，不普遍者也。夫欲早作即爲早息，早起即爲早眠；今以日光節的運動相號召，早起早作早息，宜有其一部分成效，而早眠則未敢必。一則爲上海居民，人稠室窄，夏日苦熱，勢有不能早眠者；二則居室宏敞，草地成茵者，是固可以早眠，則又盤桓於夜花園，露天劇塲，跳舞塲之不暇，風馳電掣度其「兜風」生活者之不迭，不樂早眠。故燈光可以節的，早眠可以提倡，而不限制夜娛樂夜營業，則亦等於無功。粉飾門面，不改堂奧，於工作上道德上精神之修養上，所可裨益者有幾哉。</p>
<p>抑所謂日光節的運動，誠能名實相符，則亦可嘉。然而事實上只辦公時點，求得形式上之整一；家庭生活乃至社會生活，未能獲得精神上之一致。其中最困難者莫如學校，學校與家庭最密切、學校行日光節的時間，而大多數家庭仍習故常。再加以今之學校課室缺乏，班數繁多，平時上課時間，已有提早至晨六七時者，如再提早一小時，則學校師生各方面必更多困難矣。且上海也養欣一種習慣，即買賣交易，以下午爲多，故三時以後，馬路上行人如鯽，各商店門庭成市，今撥早一小時，上午則空費時光，下午則又缺少一小時生意，此於商家爲損失。况今春分未至，氣候猶寒，天曉尙遲，遽爾提早時間，不便允多。誠不解工部局此决何以不問人情之安吾，努力推行，而於社會疾苦，治安所繫者，則又視若緩圖，此其故何歟！</p>
<p>若謂提早推行日光節的運動，爲圖節省電力起見，此以去年推行時電力消費而論，雖未獲有詳細統計，而聞所節省者有限；况去年施行已在夏令，而夏令本爲用電之閒季，故電力之節省，爲應有之事，不能謂爲日光節的運動之成效。若工部局固欲節省電力，期養成早起早息之良好習慣，則應從限制各種夜營業之種類時間始。蓋各種夜營業，實爲電力唯一之不正當消耗，亦爲社會罪惡所由生，人品墮落所由階也。故不取締夜營業，不能革除夜生活之惡習，今之脊禁雖嚴，而徜徉舞塲者，通宵達旦，出入自由，乃欲藉撥快一小時之辦法，節省電力，此則聊以自相慰藉則可，曷能收效於實際。察在工部局之布告，原非强人以必行，亦非若往年，呼籲居民以合作，僅由工部局各機關，獨行其是而已。此所予居民以不便者，亦復繁瑣不止一端耳。</p>

<p>聞昨日在米市塲拘捕之違法交易份子、除鴻泰號之張某外、尚有某米行之行員一名、截至昨晚、尚拘押在捕房中、當局或將引用非常時期平定物價及取締投機操縱辦法辦理、聞當局將着手緊急措置、使米市得以穩定、當拘捕事發後、米商一度寗靜、貼價跌至三千二百元、但小一刻鐘叉漲、卒以三千七百元收市、</p>

<p>上海電力公司某高級職員、昨日語記者稱、該公司曾要求英國駐滬領事、將上海電流供給情形、報吿倫敦英政府船業部、要求將徵發供軍用之船隻、發放至遠東航行、以解決上海燃料恐慌問題、聞英領徇此要求、業已電達本國政府、同時該公司倫敦辦事處、亦已代表上海總公司、向英政府請求救濟矣、據大中社記者探悉、上海電力公司</p>
<p>每月需煤五萬噸、由華北及印度二處、各供給半數、在歐戰前、該公司每年可自印度得煤三十萬噸至三十五萬噸、爲其任運輸者、係英國船隻、自歐戰爆發後、英船多被征作軍用、原爲該公司承運煤斤之賚賜公司輪船十四艘、爲英政府征用者、達十二艘、旣無法自印度取得煤斤、而日本又因燃料恐慌、限令將華北之煤、供日本之用、遂致發生此嚴重問題、公司方面、雖先後向各方呼籲、請求援助、但美國及加拿大船隻、皆以執行遠東口岸、每多空儎而回、無利可圖、表示「殊爲抱歉實難從命」、日方亦以其所有船隻、正忙於赶樺太島運輸木材至日本、以「愛莫能助」爲辭、現所存</p>
<p>一綫希望爲英國政府之援助、如能搆船八艘、供煤斤運輸、困難迎刃而解、則節减電力辦法、即可無須實行、又據工部局總裁兼總辦費利溥氏稱、工部局方面、並未採取同樣之步驟、工部局方面所組織之委員會、其研究範圍、亦僅限於如何分配電力、使之公允合理、惟稱、各方若能援助解決煤斤缺乏問題則深所歡迎</p>

<h3 id="c80">我拋下孩子走了 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 美君</p>
<p>我走了，拋棄我二歲的亞娜走了！為甚麼要走？為甚麼如此忍心？</p>
<p>我是一個受過相當敎育的女子，當然不會不懂得撫養孩子，是做母親的應盡的責任；我是一個有血有肉有靈魂有情感的人，當然也不會不懂得「母女之愛」；然而我走了，我毅然決然地走了：我對於一切都沒有留戀，我願意裏着眼淚，抑住破碎的心，向前走，勇敢地走！</p>
<p>本來，不能了解我的人，是會駡我無情無義，甚至說我毫無心肝的。我在新婚後的第三個月，我就趕走了我的丈夫。我向他說：「你有偉大的前程，你不能為着我，忘記了這苦難時代所給予我們靑年人的使命！」果然，他聽我的話走了。我們在別離的一天，曾共同痛哭，共同勉勵。船開走以後，我帶回來的，不是辛酸的苦味，而是光明的花朶。我向自己說：「我愛丈夫，然而我更愛祖國！」</p>
<p>這一二年來，我接受了惡劣環境的誘引，我是慢慢地走向消沉與黑暗的一面。</p>
<p>我的家裏，有一個終年遊間在外面不管家事的父母親，有一個頭腦古舊然而非常慈祥和藹的年老的母親，還有二個無能的懦弱的弟弟。父親旣然不管家事，弟弟又無能支撐家庭，於是我這一個苦命的姊姊，便負起了生活的重担。</p>
<p>世界上的好人也實在太多了！</p>
<p>我小學時人的一位先生，——一位始終痴狂地追求我的熱心人，他時常送一點慈善的錢給我的家裏。</p>
<p>有一位年靑的局長，他向我說：「美君，只要你每天陪我玩玩，我是願意負担你家裏的全部開支。」</p>
<p>有幾個大學生，每天荒廢了學業，打電話業，約我去跳舞，請我去看電影。</p>
<p>對於這些好人的好意，我都肅地拒絕了。因為我知道：他閃如此待我好，將來要我拿甚麼東西去報答他們呢？</p>
<p>再說我的夫家的壞境：</p>
<p>公婆的臉孔，自至晚朝，總是鐵板着；三四個姑娘們，不是冷笑，即是熱議，連娘姨也都要欺侮我。——我在忍受這極度痛苦的時候，沒有眼淚，却只是哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>我所以要走，所以如此忍心地拋下了孩子要走，完全是為着這環境的逼迫。我想我的走，是應該的，是並不錯誤誤的。正如朋友瓏送給我的短詩說：「上海還有甚麼値得留戀？家是一把刀，環境是一個坑，刀要宰你，坑要埋你；靑春，命運，全操縱在他們的手裏。走！只有走！這裏是一片黑暗，那邊有無限光明！」</p>
<p>現在我走了，拋下我二歲的亞娜走了！當我走的一天，亞娜還熟睡在夢裏，我想她醒回來的時候，大槪要哭了因為她已失去了媽媽；然而媽媽終有一天會回來的！</p>
<h3 id="c81">職業　遭遇 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 踪浦</p>
<p>天陰得連一絲縫都沒有抬頭看上去，只是那麼厚厚的一片。半毛小雨在外面下着，看看屋子裏有的桌子上躺着的時鐘，已是七點二十分了。忽忽嗽洗畢，夾起書包就走出亭子間。老天偏偏的不可憐人，雨下得更起勁了！電車站上立滿了乘客，兩滴到身上上，可是誰也沒有什麼表示。一陣風掠過，幾顆雨點吹進襖領，不禁的身子抖了一下，同時這樣的想，「春天了！為什麼還這樣冷？」只好聳聳兩肩，頭又往衣裳裏縮了一十，看看自己的藍布長衫上已印滿了斑斑的兩點。</p>
<p>好容易才聽到了叮叮的響聲，抖起精神預備衝上去！可是車子却仍不停的駛過去，從車廂裏飄出了不耐煩的聲音「客滿！客滿！」</p>
<p>有什麼法了呢？呆呆的望着過去的車子，下意識的拍拍身上的雨水，只好照舊的等下去！但五分鐘以後，我終於在吵讓中擠進了另一部車子，心中好像輕鬆了許多。</p>
<p>時間眞的很快，一會兒就到了目的地，走下車子，順便望一下路旁店家的鐘，已是七點三刻了。忽然肚子裏一陣響，才想起了，到現在還不曾吃早飯，就匆書記的踏進了一家小店，想買點東西來充飢，但當右手挿入衣袋的時候，剛踏進的一隻脚就又照樣的縮回來，我眞有點不相信了！「江湖的英雄們」竟會照顧到我這種人。把鈕扣解開來，仔細的一看眞的！衣袋邊上割開了二寸長的一條。我的心在抖動了！陰沉的天正象徵着我的苦惱，在幾乎失了知覺的腦子上，好像籠罩了一層烏雲一切都塗着灰暗的色彩，看不見些許的光亮，我好像模糊的記得在上車的時候，曾被人撞了一下，可是這又有什麼用呢？結果還是安慰着自己的想，「三塊錢！這不是很小的數目嗎？才不過是一月薪水的十分之一，別難過了！」這樣想着，就走近了寫着「××小學校」的大門，頹喪地跨了進去，隔着「辦公室」的玻璃窗望去，看見牆上的掛鐘離上課時間只有五分了。忽然有聲音在後面叫起來，「陸先生早！」「早！」我回過頭去微笑着也向他們說。</p>
<p>在這一瞬間，我又得到了不同的感覺，心中的悉悶被孩子們的話聲所冲淡了！拍了拍空着的肚子，大踏步地走進辦公室，光亮從我的面前閃過，嘴角又掛上了微笑。</p>

<p>讀了山立君「肖羊的女人一文，不禁使我想起了我的一個「肖虎」的唐姊。</p>
<p>唐姊死了，於今已快四年了。再也看不到她那憂鬰憔悴的臉了。</p>
<p>唐姊是「肖虎」的，假使她現在還活在人世的話，可已二十八歲了！可是她沒有活過二十四歲就給封建的惡勢力活活地磨折死了！</p>
<p>「男大當婚，女大當嫁」，這兩句古訓，就匆促地斷送了她的一切。記得在她二十三歲的那年，由于「父母之命，媒妁之言；」更加上那「小鐵口」算命先生的籌排配合，就在這年的廢歷八月某日，嫁給一個不相識的男人做妻子。</p>
<p>她的悲慘的命運就在這時開始了，她沒有過得一些快活的日子。她曾經告訴我的二妹說：「在婚後的三天，就開始他家繁重的工作，整天忙得透不過氣來，可是我不能稍為歇一歇力。翁姑的眼睛處處在尖利地監視逼迫着我。」</p>
<p>沒有三個月的工夫，她的公公突患急病死了。為了婚後不久，即喪大人。她的耳朶裏已響起了她的婆婆的惡辱的駡</p>
<p>「禍不單行，」不久！再相隔了二個多月的時候！她的丈夫也跟着他的父親相繼去世。這是一個多麼大的剌激！可是她不但沒有得到慰安和憐憫，相反地，却更受盡了婆婆的毒駡和痛打，（這次她的婆婆竟開始了用打的手段。）</p>
<p>「白虎精，總是你這個白虎害了人！」</p>
<p>在舊封建觀念的婆婆的折磨下，唐姊終於鬰鬰地被殺害了！</p>

<p>季兆雄向來也知道趙四是秋海棠的總管事，聽他這麼一說，心裏就定了許多，臉上也重復堆出很親熱的答容來，歡天喜地的看秋海棠上車走了。</p>
<p>回到天津飯店，秋海棠的腦海裏，已構成了一個很周密的計劃。</p>
<p>「趙四哥，憶給我出去買一些東西！」他來不及的掏出二十塊錢的鈔禁來，遞給趙四。祇要兩樣日用的東西就好了！</p>
<p>「究竟是什麼東西啊？」趙四呆着一張胖臉，莫明其妙地問。</p>
<p>秋海棠不回答他。</p>
<p>「女人用的？」趙四突然靈機一動，店然明白了一半。</p>
<p>「不錯，女人用的。」秋海棠一面打開一只抽雇，向裏面堆着的幾個古舊的中國信封和一疊中國信紙看了一眼。「慢些，還要買些洋信紙洋信封，要揀好的買！」</p>
<p>「這做什麼啊？」趙四更不懂了。</p>
<p>「信紙信封是我自己要用的，另外再買兩樣女人用的東西，送給羅……袁太太。」秋海棠說到這裏，臉上禁不住又透出了非常興奮的笑突。</p>
<p>「送給袁太太！二十塊錢？」趙四看着手裏的鈔標說。他想如果袁太太眞的已把他們的事料理好的話，像這麼大的一件事，像她那末闊綽的身分，怎麼好送區區二十塊錢的禮物做酬報呢？</p>
<p>「你不用管！只要買一打手帕，和一小瓶得水就够了！」秋海棠幾乎就要吿訴趙四，這是他和羅湘綺所商定的用為掩飾的方法了。（五五）</p>

<p>— 梅</p>
<p>平劇「靑風亭」一劇，是從「靑風亭」傳奇改編的。這齣戲，也有崑曲本子，可惜現在只剩了一折「趕子」。崑弋班魏慶林曾經學過這一折，可是沒有唱過。南方仙　社却沒有此本。汪傳鈐鄭傳鑑前幾年跑水路班的時候，在嘉興嘉善一帶，收庥了不少失傳的曲本，可是沒有發現「靑風亭」。偶然和鄭傳鑑談起，他還不曉得「靑風亭」有崑曲本子。「靑風亭」崑本「趕子」一折，據魏慶林吿我，和平本稍有不同。平本是繼保之生母薛周氏見張元秀一再不肯答應其領去養子，用調虎離山之計，假說亭外有一老媽媽叫喊，使張老跑出亭外，薛周氏就此急領其子而遁；張老初以為老妻賀氏到來，及見亭外幷無人影，折回亭內，繼保已失所在，薛周氏也不見了，纔曉得上了薛周氏氏之當，給他領去了養老接代的小繼保，白費了十三年心血，很傷心的回去找他老伴侶。崑曲本事是張元秀明白了薛周氏是繼保的親娘，但是不忍傳後代接香烟的小繼保在短少的時間中生離了，結果張曉得這是不能拘同的，忍着痛心，向薛鳳鳴朝陽氏說出兒子是你生養的，怎可以不給你帶去，不過我二老希望他晚年養生送死的；今日你帶去，我二老是很感激的，因為他從此可以過官家之千的生活，不要再在我家過貧苦的光陰了。末子又對繼保說：兒呀！你雖不是我二老所生的，不過我二老養你一十三年，心血也費了不少，從今往後，你不是張繼保，是薛繼保了；你不是貧苦人家的孩子，是大官人家的公子子，將來功名成就，不要忘記我家二老十三年扶養的心血，來探望探望我家二老，如果我二老都病故了，希望你在我家　老的墳上，化些錢，燒些紙，叫二聲爸爸媽媽，我家二老在地下也是開心的呀！薛周氏在旁，看了也有些不忍，就命繼保拜在張老的名下，作為義子，以為將來報恩認親的因由。薛周氏領了繼保在張元秀悲痛中分別了。二本相比，崑本的確比現在通行的平劇本子有含蓄，更深刻。</p>
<p>張元秀一角，老譚以後劉景然很好。譚小培這齣戲，在北方很出名，其實小培的神氣，身上，無一不糟。實際上雷喜福就比小培好，喜福一臉貧酸相，扮張元秀最合份的。他除了「靑風亭」以外，「一捧雪」「四進士」都比馬連良唱得討好。南方，則周信芳要數第一份。賀氏是老旦戲，周長山周長順兄弟二人都很出名。遜淸晚年，老旦人材太少。而且多是能唱而不會做，所以丑角王長林李敬山常串此角。現在反成了規矩。北方馬富祿，孫盛武，應瑞泉；南方苗勝春，焦寶奎，劉斌崑，李瀚三是常唱賀氏的。老生中北方李寶奎，南方劉韻芳和吳桂芬范叔年師徒二人，也能演賀氏的，而且還很不錯。</p>

<p>張蒼虬聽說有盜，大叫一聲，跳下床來，取過自己的實刀，奔出房門，聽得金鐵相繫之聲，許靖正在退下。他就一擺寶刀，處吼一聲，奔上前對準那人一刀劈云去。那人見屋裏又跑出一個助手，聲音洪亮，身軀健碩，月光下瞧見他臉上非常威武，頷下髮髯戟張。知道來者不善，急心把鍾去招架時，覺得刀勢沉重而迅速，遂也不敢懈怠，用出平身工夫來抵敵。許靖見張蒼虬前來協助，有心要看看他的本領，自己便讓開一邊，抱着寶劍旁觀。只見張蒼虬一柄寶刀上下翻飛，使急了時，但覩刀光，不見人影，心中暗暗佩服。然而盜馬的人本領也很不弱，舞動雙鍾，如兩團黃雲，翻翻滾滾的廝殺不休。戰够良久，張蒼虬見敵人厲害，自己一時不能取勝，心中未免有些急躁。便把刀法一變，使出五百路降龍對外友好協會貢羅漢刀來。這是張蒼虬練就的絕技，江湖上人能此的很少，人家也很難抵敵得住這五百路出奇制勝的殺手刀法的。所以一柄刀縱橫決盪，擴成一個大弧形，儘向那人逼去。那人不甘退讓，苦苦抵禦，又戰了五十餘合。只聽啷嗆一聲，跟着又是咚的一聲響，那人左手的錘頭已被張蒼虬寶刀削在地上，削斷了錘頭。那人大吃一驚，把石手錘虛晃一下，跳出圈子，回身一躍，出了短籬，飛也似的逃去。張蒼虬那裏肯放他走，便跟着躍出籬去追趕。許靖也仗劍開門跑出。見那人沿着小河，向北面逃遁。張許二人一前一後的向前緊追。那人見背後有人追趕，忽地回身一揚，一道寒光向張蒼虬門前射來。張蒼虬一邊將頭一側，，讓過敵人器，一邊大聲嚷道：「敵人休放暗器！」但是許靖隨在背後，沒有防備，也沒有瞧見。等到聽得張蒼虬的呼聲，要想躶時，暗器已到身前，正中左肩，乃是一枝小小的袖箭，立刻痛入骨髓，大叫一聲，跌倒在地。（一二）</p>

<p>看了「垂簾六十年」裏的維多利亞女皇，再來看「娜娜小姐」裏的娜娜小姐，我們對於這位有着至高演技的英國明星安娜妮格兒，是不得不予以推崇的。</p>
<p>娜娜小姐的故事，根本是幻想出來的，胡鬧，荒誔，但很可愛。羅倫楊是一個怕老婆的富翁，一度破財之後，他老婆只給他一星期十塊錢的零用。他的情婦們不知就裏，還要來敲他竹槓，大肆要挾，虧得他的姪子娜娜小姐挺身而出，替爺叔解圍。可是這位姪女，恰如廣告上所說，是一個「嘴上不不不，心裏是是是」的小姑娘，她自己也陷入情綱而不能自拔，結果呢，自然是各擁所歡，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>看了這樣的靜事，對於劇本，我們祇能「按下不表」了。至於演出方面，是一貫着好萊塢的喜劇作風的：對白的幽默，調子的輕快，在在予觀衆以欣喜的星覺；更有「歌舞」有「艷情」有「沒稽」，尤其是歌舞塲面的偉大富麗，鏡頭　度的新穎別緻，使這部月子格外來得　麗動人。</p>
<p>安娜妮格兒的娜娜小姐，演得非常可愛，嬌憨活潑，爛漫天眞。羅倫楊的風流爺叔，也恰到好處，維多麥丘戲並不多無用武　地，倒是李却卡爾遜有很好的成績。總之，這是一客「好萊塢濃湯」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Mr. Cooley's Visit to the President and Report: Lavish Praise for China's Great Future, Results of This Trip Will Soon Be Seen in Reality, Britain Will Build the Yunnan-Burma Railway to Intensify Aid to China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Dr. Cooley, administrative advisor to President Roosevelt, stated yesterday that he is convinced of China's great future, as he had declared in Chongqing. He will maintain the same attitude, and the results of his visit to China will be shown by future developments. Dr. Cooley's remarks were in response to a question about a news item published in a Tokyo newspaper yesterday. The Japanese newspaper stated that Dr. Cooley's report to President Roosevelt would be unfavorable to China, claiming that the report described the Chongqing government as dictatorial rather than democratic. Dr. Cooley told a United Press reporter that he could not comment further, but would maintain the same attitude as he had expressed when he recently left China, at which time he said, "He is convinced of China's great future." Dr. Cooley also said that he had met with President Roosevelt once regarding his trip to Chongqing, but had not yet completed his report. He will meet with the President again soon. When asked about the content of the full report, Dr. Cooley replied that he could not disclose it publicly, but the results of this trip can be seen in future actions. Minister of Finance, Mr. Kung, also said that Dr. Cooley had met with him after returning to Washington. When asked about the prospects for sending aircraft and other materials to aid China, Mr. Kung replied that Dr. Cooley had only returned on Wednesday, so the press should wait until he had completed his report. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - A high-ranking government official stated today that Dr. Cooley's recent trip to Chongqing, to investigate the economy, can be compared to Mr. Hopkins' trip to England. Mr. Hopkins is a member of the Production Administration and the National Defense Production Design Office and served as Secretary of Commerce. He went to England as President Roosevelt's special envoy for a special investigation. The high-ranking official meant that the main purpose of Cooley and Hopkins was to personally and directly report to President Roosevelt on the nature of the assistance needed by the Chinese and British governments. After completing their reports, they would participate in guiding the aid measures. The high-ranking official said that Hopkins' report has not yet been published, but Hopkins has been busy since returning from England, ensuring that the United States provides effective aid to Britain. However, the government does not currently have a definite indication of sending a large amount of aid to China immediately. The high-ranking official declined to comment on this point, but other sources still say that this aid will be limited for at least several weeks, until Britain's security is guaranteed. The general opinion here is that China is currently slightly safer than Britain, and Britain's victory is a prerequisite for China's victory. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Reliable British sources announced today that Britain may retaliate against Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Europe to see his Axis allies by providing more assistance to China. It is believed that this new aid will include building 100 miles of railway from central Burma to the Yunnan-Burma border. Britain may also assist China in accelerating the construction of railways from the border to Kunming and Rangoon. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>U.S. House Approves Large Sum for Far East Defense Spending</p>
<p>Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved a $3,415,000,000 naval appropriations bill, which allocates a large sum for U.S. defense works in the Pacific. The bill provides $150,000 for the construction of a power plant at the Olangapo naval station and Dewey dry dock in the Philippines, and the construction of 65 additional oil storage pipelines near the fuel depot in Cavite. The bill also provides $1 million to improve seaplane facilities on Guam and $187,500 to widen military roads on Guam and improve the island's power plant. The committee also approved $170,500 for the construction of houses and roads at the Samoa naval station, $2,568,500 for Johnston Island, and $4,569,326 for Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii. The Navy also submitted a memorandum requesting improvement of the power plant system at the Dewey Dry Dock. The Navy also recommended spending several thousand dollars to improve naval shore facilities in the Philippines, including hospitals and air force facilities. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Mr. Johnson, the ambassador to China who has been reassigned as minister to Australia, can leave Chongqing at any time he pleases. However, he does not know exactly when Johnson will leave Chongqing. Hull's statement was in response to reports that Johnson's reassignment to Australia may be delayed. Johnson's successor is the first minister to Australia and former Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss. Other news indicates that Johnson may remain in China for another two months because Germany may launch a spring offensive during this period, leading to tension in the Far East.

<p>729 New Ships to Be Built Next Year</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics Towers testified before the House Appropriations Committee yesterday, all advocating for the rapid completion of a two-ocean navy, saying that the international situation is deteriorating at any moment. At the beginning of this year, the navies of Germany, Italy, and Japan totaled 1,835,000 tons, not including the French fleet, while the United States had only 1,250,000 tons. Therefore, it is necessary for the United States to quickly complete a two-ocean navy. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved an appropriation of $3,415,000,000 for the Navy's next annual budget. Nearly half of this amount is to continue the construction of warships. The appropriation includes $1,515,000,000 to complete two cruisers, fourteen destroyers, eight submarines, and four auxiliary ships next year. The ships currently under construction include seventeen battleships, twelve aircraft carriers, fifty-four cruisers, one hundred and sixteen destroyers, eighty-four submarines, and many auxiliary ships. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated while testifying before the committee that, if not affected by strikes by the autumn, "We can produce a large quantity of munitions and aircraft for Britain and ourselves." He also said that at the beginning of February this year, the number of strikers had decreased from 16,000 to 45,000,000 compared to last year. He also said, "Iowa" and "New Jersey" two battleships have been completed a year earlier than originally scheduled, and the construction of other ships has also been accelerated considerably. Rear Admiral Speer testified before the committee that the Navy Department has stockpiled tungsten, tin, chromium, ramie, silk, etc., worth US$4.5 million. Rear Admiral Towers, Chief of the Bureau of Naval Aeronautics, testified that there is no danger of air force and aircraft depots on the west coast of the United States being heavily bombed. It is difficult for any enemy to fly from the distant sea to drop bombs. This appropriation includes air force expenses of $434,550,000, of which $350,372,000 is for contracts signed last year. The committee said that an additional $150,000,000 will be appropriated in the future. Of this appropriation, $75,607,000 is for the construction of facilities for 10,000 aircraft, $142,000,000 is for the modification of naval vessels, $475,000,000 is for the salaries, food, and clothing of naval personnel, $433,000,000 is for fleet maintenance, $73,000 for Marine Corps expenses, and $331,000,000 is for public construction. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of Labor Perkins and Knutson and Hillman of the National Defense Commission submitted an opinion to President Roosevelt yesterday, advocating the establishment of a supreme mediation committee to handle national defense labor disputes. Burden said President Roosevelt has not yet made a final decision on this matter, but he, Knutson and Hillman have discussed with President Roosevelt a plan to establish a new national defense labor mediation agency. Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee of the Democratic Party of Georgia, told the House Judiciary Committee that strikes in 1940 had wasted the time to build 325 bombers, and requested the enactment of laws to regulate strikes in the national defense industry.

<p>U.S. Approves 7 Billion to Meet Britain's War Needs</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox testified yesterday at a closed-door meeting of the House Appropriations Committee that the $7,000,000,000 appropriation requested by President Roosevelt under the Lend-Lease Act is sufficient for Britain to meet its current war needs. Virginia Democrat Hutralla clarified the general nature of this statement and submitted the bill for consideration by the members on Thursday, which was unanimously approved by the committee. When reporters asked whether the 7 billion represented the cost of the Lend-Lease Act for two years, Mr. Hurt said, "No one can say." (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Overseas Trade Minister Johnstone stated yesterday during questioning in the House of Commons that British loans to China have not yet been used to purchase goods overseas. Labor MP Price interjected and asked whether everything possible is now being done to assist the Republic of China in its current struggle. Johnstone replied in the affirmative. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Orders for war equipment placed by Britain in the United States that have not yet been fulfilled are worth between 300 million and 400 million U.S. dollars, and all British-owned munitions manufacturing facilities in the United States must be transferred to the U.S. government. This news was disclosed yesterday by a high-ranking U.S. government official. Negotiations on this matter are currently underway. This move can relieve the pressure on Britain in raising U.S. dollars. The munitions manufacturing facilities owned by Britain in the United States are estimated to be worth 100 million U.S. dollars. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>New York - The local Commercial News reports that the new emergency procedures drafted by the U.S. Shipping Board provide for the construction of 500 freighters for Britain. The New York Times reports that the Shipping Board may use the Washington and Manhattan liners on the New York to Lisbon route to replace the smaller ships currently operating on that route.

<p>Chongqing - Ta Kung Pao warned Japan today, "The U.S. Douglas B-19 bomber carries 18 tons of bombs, 125 paratroopers, and can fly 7,500 miles continuously without refueling. It can destroy Tokyo, Japan." The Asahi Shimbun also published photos and details of the new U.S. bomber on February 9. This type of bomber can take off from Honolulu, bomb Tokyo, and then fly back easily. The majority of buildings in Tokyo are built of wood and paper, which are ideal targets for incendiary bombs. One-third of the Japanese population is concentrated in cities and their suburbs. If bombers fly to Japan and drop bombs in densely populated areas, the Japanese will be doomed. (Since U.S. bombers can take off from Hawaii and bomb Tokyo, Japan's fate has been determined. How to bomb undefended cities, Japan has set the precedent itself." (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Implementation of the Second Daylight Saving Time <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently announced that it will hold the second Daylight Saving Time, which will be implemented today. Yesterday, this newspaper published a reader's written opinion, believing that there are difficulties for factory workers, which must be derived from past experiences, so it is known to be inconvenient. However, the Municipal Council has already announced its implementation, and the Shanghai Power Company echoed it. Can we make the Municipal Council respect public opinion and reconsider, or is it futile to say so? There is no way to speculate before they express their views. However, matters related to administration, whether it is a country or a city, are based on the welfare of the people. Those that are inconvenient to the people should be abolished. Therefore, the same hoarding, but only the hoarding of rice, flour, wheat, oil, and beans, has aroused the anger and injustice of social public opinion, precisely because it hinders the greatest welfare of the people and threatens their right to survival. To promote benefits, eliminate harms, improve lives, and ensure safety for the people is good governance. On the contrary, if there is no necessity, and there are restrictions on general life and actions, even if it is called an illegal shackle, it cannot be called a reasonable behavior. Reasonableness is consistent with human feelings, laws, and natural principles. The aim of Daylight Saving Time is to start work one hour earlier, finish work one hour earlier, or even to have one hour earlier of leisure and entertainment time. In fact, the working hours have not been increased or decreased, so there is no so-called saving. In the early years of summer, there were also those who started work one hour earlier, which was only a natural act to adapt to the climate and human feelings; because people tend to get up early in summer, and the midday is bitterly hot. Heat makes work easy to tire, and the efficiency of doing things is reduced; in the morning, the climate is mild and cool, and people are clear and refreshed; therefore, some people start working one or two hours earlier in the morning, and reduce one or two hours of work in the afternoon, or even stop working in the afternoon, depending on the circumstances of their business. It is not implemented by government decrees, not forced, and not universal. To work early is to rest early, and to get up early is to sleep early; now that Daylight Saving Time is being used as a slogan, getting up early, working early, and resting early should have some success, but it is not certain that people will sleep early. First, Shanghai residents are crowded and narrow, and the summer is bitterly hot, so it is impossible to sleep early; second, those with spacious rooms and lawns can certainly sleep early, but they are still lingering in the night gardens, open-air theaters, and dance floors, and speeding through their "driving" lives, not happy to sleep early. Therefore, lights can be saved and early sleep can be promoted, but if night entertainment and night business are not restricted, it is equal to no merit. Decorating the facade, but not changing the hall, what can be beneficial to work, morality, and spiritual cultivation?</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called Daylight Saving Time can truly match its name, then it is commendable. However, in fact, only the office hours are required to achieve formal uniformity; family life and even social life have not achieved spiritual unity. The most difficult is the school, the school and the family are the closest. The school implements Daylight Saving Time, but the majority of families still follow the old habits. In addition, there is a lack of classrooms in today's schools, and there are many classes. Usually, class time has been advanced to six or seven in the morning. If it is advanced one hour earlier, there will be more difficulties for teachers and students in all aspects. Moreover, Shanghai has also developed a habit, that is, buying and selling transactions are mostly in the afternoon, so after three o'clock, there are crowds of people on the road, and the doors of various shops become a market. Now, one hour is advanced, and the morning is spent in vain, and the afternoon is short of one hour of business. This is a loss to the merchants. Moreover, the vernal equinox has not yet arrived, the climate is still cold, and the sky is still late. It is inconvenient to advance the time so quickly. I really do not understand why the Municipal Council does not ask about the safety of human feelings, and strives to promote it, but the social sufferings and the security of the country are regarded as slow plans. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If it is said that the early implementation of Daylight Saving Time is for the sake of saving electricity, according to the electricity consumption during the implementation last year, although no detailed statistics have been obtained, it is said that the savings are limited; moreover, the implementation last year was already in summer, and summer is originally the off-season for electricity consumption, so the saving of electricity is a matter of course, and cannot be said to be the success of Daylight Saving Time. If the Municipal Council really wants to save electricity, and hopes to cultivate good habits of getting up early and resting early, it should start from restricting the types and times of various night businesses. Various night businesses are the only improper consumption of electricity, and also the source of social evils and the stage of moral degeneration. Therefore, if night businesses are not banned, the bad habits of night life cannot be eradicated. Although today's spinal cord is strictly prohibited, those who wander in dance floors are free to enter and exit all night long. The method of saving electricity by speeding up one hour can only be used to comfort oneself, but how can it be effective in practice. It can be seen that the Municipal Council's announcement is not forcing people to do it, nor is it like in previous years, calling on residents to cooperate. Only the Municipal Council's agencies are acting alone. The inconvenience to residents is also complicated and more than one.</p>

<p>The Tragic Defeat of Japanese Troops Attacking Westward from Across the River from Yichang</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Japanese troops on the opposite bank of Yichang have recently launched fierce westward attacks. After several days of intense fighting, they were repelled by a single blow from Chinese troops. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently met with a military expert to inquire about the details of this decisive battle. He said that the purpose of the Japanese attack was to consolidate the outer defenses of Yichang, fearing the threat of the Chinese army. They implemented a so-called strategy of offense as defense, attempting to seize important Chinese strongholds first and strike a blow to the Chinese army. However, the goal was not achieved, and heavy losses were incurred. The Japanese had an illusion, which was unexpected. Therefore, they have repeatedly engaged in false propaganda to cover up their defeat, claiming it was an "automatic withdrawal." However, the large number of Japanese corpses left behind, the large amount of spoils seized by the Chinese, and the use of smoke screens to retreat all speak louder than words. It was discovered that the Japanese army, starting from the 6th of this month, launched a three-pronged attack westward from the area around Mojishan on the opposite bank of Yichang, with a strength of over twenty thousand. The central route of the Japanese army first attacked Huangnikeng Daqiao Bian. One force reached Wanghuzi Chong, and another reached Xinheba. The northern route of the Japanese army once violated Huangtupo and invaded the vicinity of Pingshanba on the morning of the 10th. The southern route of the Japanese army passed through Jianjiazhao, Tiantaiguan, and Huaifan. The Japanese army's three routes launched fierce attacks within eight days, advancing more than twenty kilometers. The Chinese army launched a full-scale counterattack on the evening of the 9th. The central route of the Chinese army defeated the Japanese army attacking Xinqiaoba on the evening of the 9th and took advantage of the victory to pursue the Japanese in separate routes. That night, one route crossed Wanghuzi Chong and launched a fierce attack on Daqiao Bian. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 11th, the Japanese completely collapsed, leaving over a thousand bodies. In order to cover the retreat of their remaining troops, the Japanese released a large amount of smoke and fled eastward. The Chinese army then recaptured Daqiao Bian. By the evening, the Chinese attacking troops had crossed Taipingqiao and were advancing towards Huangnikeng. The Japanese situation was completely shaken. The northern route of the Chinese army also launched a counterattack on the same night. The Japanese initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but the Chinese army attacked from both sides. The battle was fierce. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 11th, many Japanese were killed. The remaining Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed eastward from the vicinity of Pingshanba. By the evening, the Chinese army continued to retake Huangtupo and continued to pursue the central and southern routes of the Japanese army. The Chinese army had defeated them on the 8th. The Japanese were seeking escape routes in the Mojishan area. The Japanese army's three-route retreat was chaotic. The Chinese army continued to attack along the entire line on the evening of the 12th. The Japanese army was still attempting to resist stubbornly, but their front lines were completely destroyed and the entire army was shaken. It is expected that the Chinese army will drive all the Japanese troops to the riverbank within a few days and restore the original positions. (14th dispatch)</p>

<p>Manzhouli: German Ambassador to Japan Ott departed from here this afternoon for Moscow. The ambassador intends to return to Berlin via Siberia to report on the development of the Far East situation after the establishment of the Tripartite Pact. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Diplomatic circles said yesterday that they had heard that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will request Hitler to send 1,500 German aircraft and 1,500 pilots to Japanese bases in the Far East. These aircraft will fly through the Soviet Union. Those sources say that Japan's request has been conveyed to Berlin by German Ambassador to Tokyo, General Ott. However, the Soviet Union has not yet approved the passage of these German aircraft through its territory, or may not allow them to cross its border. Other diplomats said that they believe Matsuoka is carrying a handwritten letter from the Japanese Emperor to Hitler and Mussolini, and that the mission of Matsuoka's trip is to request German air force assistance in the Far East. It is understood that the request conveyed to Berlin by Ambassador Ott also included an appeal for German assistance in seeking assurances from the Soviet Union regarding its attitude towards Japan. It is heard that the Japanese Emperor's handwritten letter suggested a final mediation of the European war and pointed out the success of Japan's reconciliation in the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: British sources here believe that Matsuoka has decided to try to conclude a non-aggression pact or similar agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union. Matsuoka may also discuss with Hitler how to plan simultaneous military actions by Japan and Germany in the spring. As for the main purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Rome, it is for propaganda, because Japan and Italy do not seem to be able to help each other at present, except to exchange greetings. Diplomatic circles here believe that Matsuoka may also ask Hitler to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. This attempt failed once in 1937. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The reports from Tokyo and European capital cities about Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Europe are strangely different. News from Tokyo said that Matsuoka tried his best to state that this trip had no special mission, while Rome and Berlin stated directly that Matsuoka's trip would result in a war against the United States. People in Washington are interested in watching this very different propaganda. Reports from New York say that the original text of Matsuoka's speech before leaving may not be seen by the German or Italian people, because the German and Italian authorities have long made their people see Matsuoka's trip as a sign that the troubled United States will be troubled. Matsuoka's remarks that he does not admit the importance of his European mission may be specifically for showing goodwill to the United States, but it may also be for the German and Italian governments, implying that he is not going to Europe to ask for instructions from Germany and Italy, but wants to obtain various information so that Japan can make its own decisions based on it. Unfortunately for the Axis powers, it is impossible to take Italy's crushing defeat as the prelude to the victory of the Axis powers' honor, but they deliberately propagate that after Matsuoka meets with the German and Italian dictators, the terms of the Axis alliance will cause a direct conflict between Japan and the United States. It is important to know that although Japanese naval and military personnel have published unconscious remarks in newspapers, the last thing Japan wants is to go to war with the United States before achieving its goals in the Far East. If Germany is indeed confident of defeating Britain, then Japan may be willing to risk engaging the United States in order to achieve its Pacific goals. However, Japan may not be willing to attack Malaya or the Dutch East Indies to increase the hope of German and Italian victory. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii received reporters today, when asked about the news in American newspapers that Foreign Minister Matsuoka would be willing to visit Washington and London if invited, Ishii replied that this was only newspaper news and he did not know about it. Someone also asked if Matsuoka would go to Moscow. Ishii replied that everything was not confirmed. Matsuoka did not mention this before his departure. Someone also asked who Matsuoka planned to meet in Europe. Ishii replied that Matsuoka had already announced that he planned to meet with the leaders of Germany and Italy related to the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact. As for the period of Matsuoka's stay in Europe, it all depends on the affairs being handled, but because he has to deal with state affairs, he will return to his country as soon as possible. A certain newspaper said that he would return to Japan in six weeks, which may be a clever prediction. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka addressed the Japanese public again tonight, reiterating that his talks with Germany and Italy had no special pre-arranged procedures, and urged the public to remain calm and treat foreigners kindly and equally, without particularly hating any country. Matsuoka's speech was recorded by sound recording before leaving Osaka yesterday and broadcast nationwide tonight. Matsuoka said that his trip was too much publicized, but he was only imitating the state ministers of Europe and America, who often visit foreign countries and their politicians. Matsuoka also said, "I want to meet Hitler and the important leaders of our allied countries. If there is time, I will have a frank discussion." (14th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens – A Greek government spokesperson announced today that Greek forces in Albania, after defeating the offensive personally directed by Mussolini, have launched a counteroffensive, occupying several locations, and capturing 240 enemy soldiers, including two lieutenant colonels and twelve other officers. Mussolini anxiously awaited news of the Italian counteroffensive at headquarters, hoping for results today, but the five divisions of the Italian army suffered another devastating defeat, failing to gain any ground. The fighting is concentrated in a central area fifteen miles wide and 3,600 feet high. The bright moonlight last night led to frequent engagements, with Italian forces apparently attempting a successful surprise attack, but they suffered heavy casualties and retreated. The battlefield is strewn with dead and wounded soldiers. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Athens – Athens Radio broadcast a Greek intelligence report last night stating that Italian forces in Albania launched a major counteroffensive yesterday with the aid of heavy artillery fire, but failed to regain any ground and were eventually forced to retreat, leaving behind many dead and wounded. Mussolini’s presence in Albania has been confirmed by numerous Italian prisoners of war, leaving no doubt. However, Mussolini has failed to change the course of the war. Mussolini is scheduled to return to Italy on Saturday, originally intending to return in victory to console his worried people, but instead has suffered a devastating defeat and the curses of his own soldiers, returning in disgrace. Last night's Greek High Command bulletin stated that the enemy continued their counteroffensive throughout the day, launching repeated attacks along a wide front, using large numbers of infantry supported by artillery and aircraft, but all were repulsed, suffering extremely heavy losses. Greek aircraft heavily attacked enemy military targets, and Greek anti-aircraft guns shot down two enemy aircraft. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Athens – A Greek government spokesperson stated yesterday that the Italian spring offensive in Albania, personally directed by Mussolini, is nearing its end. According to Italian prisoners of war, fighting remains intense along the sixteen-mile front in the central area where Mussolini's headquarters is located. All reports indicate that the Italian offensive is heading towards a disappointing outcome. The Greek spokesperson said that in the western part of the central sector, Italian forces launched a nighttime offensive after heavy artillery bombardment, followed by a dawn assault. The assault was carried out by significant forces, but they suffered terrible losses and retreated, abandoning huge quantities of military supplies, telephones, guns, and other equipment. The battlefield is littered with Italian corpses. In the far north, Italian forces also launched a surprising frontal attack without using artillery, but were also defeated. Positions in the northern and western parts of that area, where Italian forces launched a dawn attack, have now been occupied by Greek forces. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Struma Hotel Bombing Case – Report by Knatchbull-Hugessen <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>London – The bomb that exploded in the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul was planted in the luggage of a member of the British Embassy staff in Bucharest before they left the Romanian capital. This has been confirmed in a report by former British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, to the British Foreign Office. The report states that two suitcases were placed on the train, containing dirty clothes, old newspapers, and dry batteries. Upon arrival at the Pera Palace Hotel, one exploded. A member of the British Air Attaché’s staff, Mr. Armbruster, quickly threw the second suitcase into a hole in the ground to prevent further disaster. It was subsequently discovered that the suitcase contained a highly explosive bomb. This clearly shows that the powerful bomb was planted in the luggage of the British Embassy staff before they left Bucharest, with the intention of the bomb exploding on the train, destroying the train and causing many deaths.

<p>London – According to unconfirmed reports received here last night, Germany has sent a note to the Yugoslav government, making the following five demands: (1) Demobilization of the Yugoslav army; (2) Complete German control of Yugoslavia's economy and transportation system; (3) Granting Germany the right to transport war materials through Yugoslavia, with troops passing through Romania and Bulgaria; (4) Granting Germany the right to transport troops through Yugoslavia in the future if necessary; (5) Yugoslavia signing the Tripartite Pact. It is rumored that Yugoslavia currently has over one million soldiers on standby. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London – Ankara Radio broadcasted last night that Yugoslavia is resisting Nazi pressure and has decided to maintain neutrality. German pressure has aroused anti-Axis sentiment among the Yugoslav people. Although it was announced on Wednesday that Germany and Yugoslavia had reached an understanding, Germany subsequently changed its demands, seemingly making Yugoslavia unwilling to sign an agreement. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – According to well-informed sources, although Germany is strongly urging Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, Yugoslavia is only willing to maintain good relations with its neighbors and is unwilling to make any concessions to Germany that are incompatible with the country's realities. It is expected that Yugoslavia will be prepared to accept expressions of friendship and non-aggression and to establish a treaty that formalizes the existing economic relations between Yugoslavia and Germany. The Yugoslav capital was superficially calm yesterday, as German-Yugoslav talks are still proceeding through normal diplomatic channels. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Istanbul – According to Turkish press and radio reports yesterday, the Turkish Prime Minister's scheduled speech to Parliament will be postponed indefinitely due to the instability of the Balkan situation. This news was broadcast by Esme, political editor of the semi-official "Ulus" newspaper. Esme said that the situation in Yugoslavia is indeed unstable, and Turkey is closely monitoring Yugoslavia. "If Yugoslavia resists German aggression from Bulgaria, Turkey will fulfill its obligations and assist Greece and Yugoslavia in the war. If Yugoslavia joins the Axis, then Turkey will consider canceling its obligations to Yugoslavia." Esme also stated that Turkey will resist any aggression that infringes on Turkish territory and independence. However, he also stated that such aggression is unlikely because Germany cannot hope to control the Mediterranean, and attacking Turkey would not make the overall war more effective. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Despite the presence of German troops on the border, Turkey remains calm and orderly. Every man, woman, and child knows how to act in an emergency.

<p>London – The Admiralty announced the laying of new minefields in the Red Sea, stating that it is dangerous to navigate in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. Ships passing through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden should navigate through the main straits, and those who disregard this warning do so at their own risk.

<p>Washington – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that key figures in the US State Department and British officials have discussed relaxing the blockade of the European continent to allow food to be transported to unoccupied France. These individuals believe that the decision on this matter is one of the most important aspects of Anglo-American cooperation, and stated that judging from the recent threats by French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan, if Britain continues to refuse to open the blockade, it will lead to closer cooperation between Vichy and Berlin. It was also stated that the British government may accept the large quantities of food shipped by the United States. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Well-informed sources here recently stated that France's food problem is becoming increasingly serious. The government is currently considering a plan to escort merchant ships carrying food back to France from overseas with warships, a plan that is fully justified. France has long relied on overseas territories and foreign countries for food supplies. In 1938, even with a bumper harvest throughout France, the food supply was still not self-sufficient. France's food supply depends entirely on foreign supplies, as can be seen from this. After the outbreak of the current European war, most of the agricultural areas became war zones, and hundreds of thousands of farmers were captured, bringing agricultural production to a standstill. Last autumn's harvest was more than half that of 1938. For this reason, the food problem has become the most important problem facing France today. Since the free zone of France is not a wheat-producing area, its need for food supplies from the United States and Argentina is extremely urgent. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding the issue of British ships intercepting French food ships, well-informed sources here recently stated that the US government has made some progress in exchanging views with the UK. On the one hand, the US sympathizes with France's unfortunate situation, and on the other hand, it believes that certain reasons held by the UK are not fully justified. Therefore, it advocates that the UK should be accommodating so that the free zone of France can still obtain food supplies from overseas. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>London – The British Air Ministry announced last night that on Wednesday night, the British Air Force used new long-range bombers to conduct lightning strikes on Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, and other occupied areas, dropping countless unprecedentedly large bombs on Berlin. It is said that the four-engine American aircraft that recently flew across the Atlantic also participated in the bombing several times. These aircraft are the famous "Flying Fortresses". The communiqué stated that a blaze engulfing the sky over Berlin was clearly visible for a hundred miles, proving that this attack was the most intense and extensive since the British Air Force began bombing Europe. The communiqué stated that Berlin "received much" as incendiary bombs and the largest caliber explosive bombs rained down. It is said that some British aircraft flew at extremely low altitudes, strafing their targets with machine guns. It is reported that British aircraft paid particular attention to railway yards. Huge explosions were followed by large fires that burned throughout the night. It is reported that the main target in Bremen was an important munitions factory producing military supplies. The British Air Force attacked the factory for several hours. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to authoritative sources yesterday, British aircraft bombed Bremen on Wednesday night, causing several fires in residential areas, but they were quickly extinguished. There were three deaths and three injuries. Hamburg was also bombed on the same night, with most bombs hitting residential areas, but there was also damage in industrial areas. Several fires broke out, killing five people and injuring twenty-four. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London – The British Air Force again raided North German seaports last night. Hamburg suffered an unprecedentedly heavy bombing. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that last night, the British Bomber Command took advantage of the bright moonlight to inflict the heaviest blows on Hamburg. Several heavy bombs struck shipyards, and docks and warehouses were hit and caught fire. Other targets near the mouth of the Elbe River were also heavily bombed. British aircraft also bombed an oil refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands, causing a large fire. Coastal Command aircraft carried out multiple raids yesterday, day and night. A total of six British aircraft did not return. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London – According to an announcement this afternoon, eleven German aircraft were shot down last night during raids over Britain. Eight were shot down by fighters, one was destroyed by anti-aircraft fire, and the details of the remaining two are unknown. Although only half of March has passed, the highest monthly record for German night bomber aircraft shot down has already been broken. The total number since March 1 has reached thirty-three. The previous highest monthly record was in September of last year, with a total of twenty-nine German night raid aircraft shot down in one month. The main target of last night's German air raid was Cressing, where several factory buildings and houses were destroyed, but casualties were not great. Several locations in Moers were also bombed last night, with the most damage to houses in residential areas and minimal casualties. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon, the German military bulletin stated that last night, German fighter groups attacked the British shipbuilding center of Glasgow. With the clear moonlight, German aircraft selected their targets and attacked docks, shipyards, warehouses, and granaries for several hours.

<p>London – Today's newspapers criticized the British Air Force's heavy bombing of various German locations on Wednesday and the losses suffered by German bombers in the British air raid on that day, saying that the comparison shows that British aircraft have gradually gained air superiority. The Daily Telegraph also predicted that British aircraft would take new offensive preparations for more intense aerial battles. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>The First Division football championship will be decided today. East China will face Western Police at 2:30 PM this afternoon at the Lyceum on Albert Road. Ticket prices remain the same. East China's lineup is the same as the one that defeated Portugal last week. Li Yichen remains at full-back, forming two iron gates with Zhuang Youren. The central defenders, Han Liang, and the five forwards are also the same as last week. Although Western Police has lost to East China twice in the first round of the league and the Scott Cup, both victories were due to luck. In terms of strength, East China is not inferior to Western Police. Looking at Western Police's lineup, apart from the three or four veterans Viktor, Teife, Willie Walter, and Zhuolunzi, there are no outstanding players. Therefore, if East China can continue its momentum from defeating Portugal, it will surely be able to defeat Western Police in one go and seize this year's First Division crown. The other two matches, Second Division Su Geer vs. Yousheng and Third Division Zhen Dan vs. Hezibao, will both be held at the Aurora University field. According to a notice from the Western Football Association, the Second Division match between Youyou and the Russian Army tomorrow morning has been forfeited by Youyou and will not be held. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Western Police - East China First Division 2:30 PM Lyceum</p>
<p>Su Geer - Yousheng Second Division 3:20 PM Aurora University</p>

<p>The final act of the Third New Six Cup All-Shanghai Table Tennis Team Championship, sponsored by Zhejiang Industrial Bank, will be the championship battle between the perennial champions Friendly Nation and China Righteousness A. The match will take place at 7:00 PM tonight at the Lake Society Auditorium on Beijing Road. Chen Linsheng, Xu Duo, Ding Du, Fu Guiqing, and others will serve as referees. Mr. Sun Ruihuang has been specially invited to present the awards. Both teams are recognized as strong forces in Shanghai. If Friendly Nation wins tonight, they will be the champions; if they lose, their points will be equal to China Righteousness A, and another match will be needed to determine the winner. A fierce battle is expected. Before the match, there will be an individual final between Zhang of Jiufeng and Liu Zao of Wanxia A. Although Liu is brave and skilled, he is likely no match for Zhang Ying. However, a fierce battle is inevitable. Tickets are priced at one yuan and two yuan downstairs, and five jiao and three jiao upstairs. They will be sold at the door on the spot. All teams that have never been absent or forfeited throughout the group stage can send one or two representatives to the venue to receive a spirit award. The committee has specially assigned Zai Meifeng and Wu Zhaofeng to attend, report on the progress, and announce the names of each team's representatives. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Since the Paramount basketball team decided to accept the invitation of the Hong Kong Oriental Sports Association and travel south to the Philippine Islands, Singapore, Penang, and other Southeast Asian islands with the Oriental football team, the Oriental team has scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 25th of this month, so the Paramount team has also decided to take the Yihua Mingsheng liner south on the 19th of this month. It is reported that the main force of the Paramount expeditionary force, Wang Hongbin and Qian Xiangcheng, are far away in Tianjin and Qingdao. After being urged by telegram, Wang and Ren have started their journeys to Shanghai respectively, and are expected to gather in Shanghai tomorrow night (16th). As for Cai Yanxiong and Da Di, they can also gather in Hong Kong as scheduled. Xu Wenkui was originally in Hong Kong Island, and the passport issue is also waiting to be issued, which should not be a problem. However, the leave application problems of Chen Xianglong and Feng Nianhua have not yet been approved, but they are still continuing to apply. Qian Xiangcheng was originally scheduled to marry Ms. Chen at the Shanghai Xianle Dance Hall on the 19th of this month, but now because the expeditionary force departs on the 19th, the wedding will also be held earlier on the 18th. The best man will be Wang Hongbin, and the officiant will be Mr. Li Zhenzhong. As for the Gu brothers, the mainstays of Paramount, only Li Kang will lead the team to the south, while Sen Kang will not be able to accompany him due to the many public affairs in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Grain Rice Market Changes Three Times a Day From Rise to Fall Back to High Opening Highest at 4,000 Yuan Per Package The Wolf's Heart of Price Gouging is Still Not Dead After the Storm, Prices are Raised Again <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market rose and fell sharply, and the market price fluctuated by as much as seven or eight yuan. The early market rise was still the usual tactic of speculators spreading rumors and raising prices. It was rumored in the black market that the 3,000 tons of rice set by Saigon lacked shipping, and that the Japanese merchants were also transporting foreign rice, which aroused people's anxieties even more. The hoarders took the opportunity to hoard and manipulate, and the practice of price speculation became more and more intense, surging all the way and fluctuating endlessly. At that time, the price speculation for each white package in the small market reached 4,000 yuan. The second-grade Saigon also reached 3,700 or 800 yuan, and the first-grade Saigon Siam reached 3,500 or 600 yuan. In the black market, the increase was as much as 700 or 800 yuan, which was another leap of 500 or 600 yuan compared to the previous day, which was really staggering. Who would have thought that the hoarders would be ecstatic, and the undercover agents in the market secretly monitored them, detected illegal transactions, and arrested a rice merchant, Zhang Mou. Once the news spread, the hoarders also became wary and immediately restrained themselves. Most of them did not dare to enter the market again, and the retailers were frightened and came out of their nests, and the market price suddenly decreased. From this, it can be seen that if the authorities in the concession can enforce the law impartially and severely investigate, it will indeed have a very easy effect on stabilizing the rice market. If they can further investigate private hoarding and order sales, they must pay attention to the large households with both wealth and power, break through the emotional barriers, and take fair measures. Then, the realization of the stability of the rice market may not be impossible. The price of small glutinous rice per hundred packages rose from 3,500 or 600 yuan to 4,000 yuan, and then fell to 3,200 yuan, a huge amount of eight yuan. Other small amounts varied from three to five or six yuan. Subsequently, because many large households still insisted on not selling, and the short covering and new longs took advantage of the flat absorption, the market rose again by two or three yuan. As a result, the price speculation for small glutinous rice was 3,400 or 500 yuan per white package, which was still slightly higher than the previous night. Small glutinous rice was 3,600 yuan, second-grade Saigon was 3,400 or 500 yuan, first-grade Saigon Siam was 3,100 or 200 yuan, 2,800 yuan for the decision, and 2,400 or 500 yuan for broken tips. However, looking back at the previous market, this price is still increased by about three yuan per package.</p>
<p>After the thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice recovered from fatigue for two days, yesterday the owners saw that the goods were limited, and the foreign rice continued to boom, so they were determined not to relax. The local shops and other customers also held the same opinion, and because of the consecutive days of watching, the stock was gradually thinning and urgently needed to be replenished. Therefore, they took the opportunity of the stable period to successively enter, and the sales market turned smoothly for a while. Under the shouting of the owners, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice all recovered by more than two yuan. It is estimated that Changbang Gao White Japonica rice is 127 yuan, Kunshan is 123 yuan and 5 yuan, Qingjiao is 121 and a half yuan for thin rice, and the second is 120 yuan and a half yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of glutinous rice in the market is scarce, and the sales market in all directions is still wide, so the supply continues to be insufficient. The owners are hoarding and acting coquettishly, and the market price has risen again by a huge four yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong Baiyuan is as high as 109 yuan, and the decision is 106 yuan. This is because it is not subject to the limit price and is also driven by the rice injection.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is surging fiercely. Yesterday, Taikoo Chongqing and Hong Kong transported 5,413 packages, and the company's Hanyang also loaded 3,010 packages from Hong Kong, all of which were unloaded at the French Concession's own pier. The Java Company's Zhini Canada transported a large amount of 2,400 tons of foreign rice via Hong Kong, totaling 24,500 packages. Yesterday, a total of more than 22,000 packages arrived. (Grandson)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Flour Market Prosperous Another Rise of About One Yuan <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Flour In yesterday's foreign flour market, the situation was quite good. Although there were no official transactions in the market, speculation and retail hoarding secretly bought a lot. This was due to the influence of the soaring rice prices, which made people panic and unable to live in peace. 50,000 packages of the newly arrived sailboat brand Canadian flour have already been unloaded. The owners are all guarding and not selling, so it is not easy for buyers to get a lot. It is heard that the price of Australian flour with the clock tower and bird pattern is 33 yuan and 45 cents, and the price of Jinlong and sailboat brand Canadian flour is also 32 yuan. The market is thriving, and it is about one yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour A large amount of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang, in addition to transporting foreign rice from Hong Kong, also has a large amount of flour, totaling 47,498 packages, which are produced in Australia and are being unloaded yesterday.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday's wheat transaction was still sluggish. The market wanted to purchase goods. Fufeng Factory has stopped production due to lack of wheat. Fuxin Factory is reluctantly supplying it with newly arrived foreign wheat. Du Wheat has also been ignored. Although the Japanese factory's appetite is strong, it is also without goods to import. The market is still as silent as before.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Oil Beans and Grains Easy to Rise but Difficult to Fall <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's turbulent market for miscellaneous grains and oil beans was truly shocking. Due to the previous unsettled bean cake transactions and frequent disputes, spot transactions for bean cakes were automatically suspended. However, the situation is still favorable. Peanut oil fell by two yuan. There were no spot goods for soybean oil. In the futures market, the oil regulation company organized in the morning released it, and the opening price was lowered by one and a half yuan (137 yuan and a half). Afterwards, the hoarders absorbed at a low price, so the competition in the middle was quite fierce, and the market price fluctuated. Because the company has ample funds, under the pressure, its lowest price fell by six or six or six yuan compared to the previous day's market (133 yuan). However, the hoarders outside the industry made every effort to search, and the result was that it was forced up to the opening price. There was also inquiry about the export route for soybeans, and the hoarders gained momentum, and the market price soared by about two yuan. Spot corn was firm and stable. Some people took profits and came out in the futures market, so the market was flattened, and it also fell by one yuan in the middle.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Finance Foreign Exchange Inflow Booming Again <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market HSBC's listing did not rise or fall. In the dark market of British and American exchanges, the demand was high due to the endless stream of speculators. However, foreign banks and American banks did not supply enough, and although the potential was good, it was still stable. It was heard at noon that there were many transactions. Hong Kong Electric, import firms, and Chinese merchants and speculators all came to buy near-term and forward US exchanges, resulting in an opening price of 5.46875 yuan. By noon, it was difficult to close the April contract. The shilling Hong Kong Electric once offered some to the British bank, and it was also softened to 3 shillings 34375. Later, due to the absorption by British and American Tobacco, it returned to softness, and the monthly contract shrunk. The closing price in the evening was 3 shillings 34375 for spot British gold and 5.46875 yuan for US exchange, which was 0.015625 higher than the previous day. The US was neither good nor bad. The futures US exchange contracted.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Purchases Chinese Merchants Follow Up</p>
<p>In the early morning, because the recent fixing of the big London bill was smooth and the forward contract rose by 0.0615, the silver price in New York was still flat, the raw gold in London was stable, and the exchange rate between British and American Shanghai was unchanged. The exchange rate between the US and the UK did not change, and it fell by one point against Shanghai. There was no market against France. The central listing and all exchanges remained the same. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning at 3 shillings 359375 for British gold and 5 yuan 57875 for US exchange, both of which were the same as the closing price of the previous day. After opening, it was first heard that Hong Kong Electric came to buy the exchange, and the Chinese bank was willing to sell, and the market was stable. It is estimated that the Chinese bank's Zhejiang issued the April US exchange for Hong Kong Electric at 5 yuan 46875. The American bank supplied the four-month exchange at 5.46875 yuan for import firms and Chinese merchants and speculators to follow up. The market became brisk due to the booming demand for forward contracts. The US four-month exchange and the current month exchange were seen to be pulled apart again, but the current and forward trends of the shilling were consistent and softened at the same time. The result of the noon close was that the spot exchange had reached 5 yuan 34375, and the US exchange was still 5 yuan 46875.</p>
<p>British and American Tobacco Have Settlements</p>
<p>At the beginning of the afternoon market, speculators came to sell the April US exchange, so the potential once recovered. It is estimated that a speculator sold to a certain American bank at a price of 5 yuan 46875, but soon after, the British and American Tobacco Company suddenly had a need and settled the April US exchange with a certain American bank at 5 yuan 4375, and the current exchange of 5 yuan 46875 for the current month was also difficult to close. The result of the evening close was that the spot exchange and the near-term and forward British exchanges were all 3 shillings 34375, the spot US exchange was 5 yuan 46875, and the near-term and forward exchanges were all 5 yuan 4375. Compared with the closing price yesterday, the British exchange's spot and futures contracted by 0.015625, the US exchange's spot was fixed, and the near-term and forward contracts were tightened by 0.03125 each.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Shanghai Exchange Alone Sees a Slight Increase</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 14th (Friday) Electricity. The exchange market opened flat this morning. The British, American, and Japanese exchanges did not rise or fall (the spot US exchange closed back to 24 yuan and a half yesterday).

<p>Tianjin, 14th (Friday) Electricity. The exchange market opened soft this morning. The London telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.0625, to 3 pence 75. The New York telegraphic transfer shrunk by 0.09375, to 6 yuan 15625. The Shanghai exchange rose by 2 jiao and 5 points, to 88 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 points. The "United Note" dark plate slightly increased by 1 jiao, to 73 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Cash Plummets by a Hundred Dollars; Swap Traders Forced to Pay Out <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market witnessed hectic trading in the pre-market session. It coincided with the swap date for February transitioning into April. Trading commenced from 1 PM to 2 PM, so the March contract remained firm in the morning, bolstered by tight foreign exchange conditions. It was rumored that sellers had to pay out forty dollars to buyers, leading to a flurry of short covering. Eventually, a certain gold firm supplied 700 taels, and the price rose from six thousand three hundred and fifteen dollars to six thousand three hundred and sixty-eight dollars without any significant fluctuation. In the afternoon, due to the payout required by swap sellers, the April contract debuted at a lower price of six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars, triggering a wave of profit-taking. The U.S. dollar also strengthened, causing the price to retreat to six thousand three hundred and five dollars. Exchange merchants stepped in, stabilizing the market, and the price settled at six thousand three hundred and twenty-three dollars, nominally down seven dollars but effectively up thirty-one dollars, reflecting the thirty-eight-dollar payout by swap sellers. Total trading volume for the day exceeded thirty thousand taels. Cash supply exceeded demand, causing a sharp decline of nearly one hundred dollars. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Hectic Trading, Nominally Down, Effectively Up</p>
<p>From the morning, the March contract per bar (ten taels) initially showed strength, opening at six thousand three hundred and fifty dollars at 9:15 AM, twenty dollars higher than the previous evening's closing price. Cheng Kee Cheung Wo sold, and the price retreated to six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars. Tak Chee Hang Kee bought in, and as foreign exchange softened, the price gradually rose, gaining over thirty dollars to reach six thousand three hundred and sixty-eight dollars. Cheng Kee sold again, and Tai Fung also offered, around six thousand three hundred and sixty dollars, which Tung Hong Wing Sum Yuen bought. The market generally stabilized, closing at six thousand three hundred and fifty-nine dollars at noon, up twenty-nine dollars from the previous day's closing price, with a fluctuation of thirty-three dollars in the first half of the day. At 12:40 PM, swap trading, transitioning from March to April, began off-market. Initially, sellers offered a payout of thirty-five dollars to buyers. Hang Kee and Cheng Fei paid in, minimally twenty-seven dollars. Soon, sellers such as Tin Yuen Yat Lei Sun Fung Wing Loi offered payouts, gradually increasing to forty dollars officially at 1 PM, finalized at forty-two dollars. Cheng Kee, Sum Yuen, and Hang Kee continued to pay in, later retracting slightly to thirty-six dollars, and finally thirty-eight dollars. At 2 PM, the April contract opened at six thousand three hundred and thirty-five dollars, twenty-four dollars lower than the noon closing price (for March), inevitably triggering profit-taking. Sun Fung Wing, Tai Fung, Tung Hong, and Wing Yat sold, causing an immediate drop of thirty dollars to six thousand three hundred and five dollars. Exchange merchants suddenly stepped in, and Yan Sing Wing and Hang Kee bought, pushing the price back up to around six thousand three hundred and fifteen dollars. Sun Fung Wing bought in, and the market closed at six thousand three hundred and twenty-three dollars at 4 PM, nominally down seven dollars from the previous market price, but with the addition of the thirty-eight-dollar forward premium, effectively up thirty-one dollars. Based on the April contract's U.S. dollar exchange rate of 5.4375, the settlement price was six thousand four hundred and four dollars and sixty cents, accounting for a difference of eighty-one dollars and sixty cents. The afternoon saw a fluctuation of thirty dollars, with a total difference of sixty-three dollars for the day. After closing, the price retreated to six thousand three hundred and sixteen dollars. Cash prices saw a gradual decline, starting with Tak Foo offering 100 taels and Ho Shing offering 50 taels, both at a price of three hundred and eighty dollars above the March contract price. Cheung Wo offered 100 taels at three hundred and seventy dollars above. In the afternoon, Tak Foo offered Sun Yuen 100 taels at three hundred and seventy dollars above the April contract price. The cash market firms' listed selling prices were three hundred and eighty dollars higher than the hectic forward contract price, and the buying prices were eighty dollars lower than the selling prices. There was still no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Ta Tung Hong and Sun Tung Hong remained at six hundred and ninety dollars, with a forty-dollar reduction for purchases, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Foreign Currencies Mixed <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slightly rising pre-market prices, but cash prices remained weak. British and American gold pounds remained level, while British gold drafts softened. The U.S. dollar fluctuated after rising, eventually settling at the same level, reaching a high of eighteen dollars, one dime, and six cents at noon, finally settling at eighteen dollars and one dime. Hong Kong drafts showed a firm trend, reaching a high of four dollars, four dimes, and eight cents in the evening market. Japanese yen and Korean drafts showed upward trends, with the former rising to one dollar, nine dimes, and five mils, and the latter rising to one dollar, five dimes, and eight cents.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Securities: Domestic Debt Plunging <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The public debt market was weak and declining. Most activity was concentrated in Category C bonds, which declined significantly. Category B bonds were already past the lottery drawing, so there were many sellers. Category A bonds were highly valued due to their lottery rights, small volume, and short term, so everyone rushed to them, and short sellers were reluctant to sell them, limiting their decline. Yesterday, rumors persisted, and bulls retreated. Although there was still buying, it was not as enthusiastic as before. The market was flat and weak in the morning. Shun Cheong, Hang Hong, and Union Lee bought a lot, and Five Wo, Tai Wah, and Tai Tung bought at market prices, limiting the decline. In the afternoon, selling pressure increased. Xie Hong, Wo Fung, Tai Chung, Tak, and Union Ho also sold a lot. Category C bonds opened at six dollars and seven dimes, quickly breaking the six-dollar mark. Shun Cheong, Wing Hong, Union Lee, Shun Cheong, Xie Tai, Yi Chung, Cheung Hong, and Ku Foo bought, but were not enthusiastic, and the market appeared sluggish. The trend was still uncertain, and the future may see some fluctuation. It is hoped that the rumors will subside. Market prices ultimately fell by two dimes to one dollar. Trading volume was over three million dollars. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading involved one hundred shares of Zhabei Electric Power stock, priced at eight dollars.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued to strengthen, with active closing and short covering at the end of the week. Prominent stocks such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire saw significant trading volume, and prices were slightly higher than before. Investor sentiment seemed increasingly optimistic. Rubber stocks remained stable.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Thursday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies remained flat. Only the shares of The Mercantile Bank of India, London and China dropped two shillings and six pence to a price of eight pounds, seventeen shillings, and six pence. There were no other changes.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Yarn and Cotton: Single Yarn Strengthens; Double Horse Heavily Contested <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has returned to a state of flux, but actual sales are relatively active. However, it seems that 32-count single yarn is more popular, so its price is high. A major player in the industry believes that the price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so they are buying and holding. However, futures and gold speculators are selling short, leading to intense competition. The price is hovering around the 1,400-dollar mark. Market speculation suggests that if the price breaks through the high of 1,424 dollars, there will be a large increase; otherwise, it will continue to fluctuate. The high price for 20-count yarn was 1,416 dollars, and the low price was 1,398 dollars. Afternoon trading started at 1,405-6 dollars, falling to 1,398 dollars mid-session, and finally closing at 1,405 dollars.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened flat. The initial price was 1,400 dollars, soon rising to 1,407 dollars. Buyers remained active, pushing the price to 1,411 dollars. However, profit-takers sold, and the price fell to 1,40x dollars. As prices rose and Guang stocks were in demand, the price gradually advanced to 1,416 dollars. However, prices were slightly high, and bulls released their holdings. Short sellers became active again, and the market weakened, closing at 1,398 dollars. The total trading volume for the half-day was 5,460 bales. The breakdown of purchases by different groups is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 345  Mainland 100</p>
<p>Domestic 5,000  Fujian 15</p>
<p>Total 5,460</p>
<h3 id="e54">Cotton Mills' Demand is Increasing <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is good, as Chinese mills are actively purchasing, but the volume of incoming shipments is not yet strong. However, the prices of 32-count and 4x-count raw materials are particularly high.</p>
<p>New York's cotton market is lively, strong, and developing evenly. Subsequent purchases from New Orleans and a good spot market continued to push prices higher, resulting in an increase of three to four pound notes compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is very quiet. Yesterday's forecast was a slight increase of half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading is still dominated by long-staple wool samples. The market is more active than before. In recent days, buying interest from all parties has increased, with both domestic and cotton mills participating in the purchase. Under such enthusiastic circumstances, the transaction volume exceeded two thousand bales. It is expected that due to favorable conditions and the fact that most spot holders are unwilling to sell, there will be even more activity in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Piece Goods: Stockpiling Activity; Cloth Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was firm yesterday, and cloth prices rose slightly. White coarse cloth rose by two dimes and five cents per piece, while fine cloth twill also rose by one dime and five cents. Dyed cloth and dyed twill rose by five dimes. However, bleached cloth remained flat due to stagnant sales. Trading volume for various cloths was over five hundred pieces. Stockpiling activity was intense, and buying sentiment was strong. Sales to Guangdong and Hong Kong were relatively strong, with over three hundred pieces of dyed cloth and dyed twill traded. Merchants from Eastern Zhejiang (Wenzhou and Ningbo) bought over one hundred pieces of coarse and fine cloth and dyed cloth. Fujian merchants bought one hundred and several dozens of pieces of blue cloth, dyed twill, printed cloth, and coarse and fine cloth.

<h3 id="e56">Rice Market Rampage Reaches its Peak; Decisive Action Should be Taken; Rice Merchants Arrested Yesterday for Violating Orders; Black Market Prices Once Plunged, Then Rose Sharply; The Severity of Punishment for the Arrested Rice Merchants is Watched by All Circles <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions, due to the continuous surge in rice prices and the rampant speculation of rice merchants, which not only affects the livelihoods of citizens but also disrupts public order, after repeated discussions with relevant parties under the supervision of public opinion and appeals from all sides, decided to take emergency action. They secretly ordered market detectives to conduct strict investigations and arrests. However, the speculative rice merchants, believing that the authorities had no concrete measures to restrain them for the moment, continued their own way. After the market opened yesterday, prices began to rise. Small grain futures prices rose to four thousand dollars per hundred bags. Market detectives, with swift and decisive means, began to perform their duties, arresting law-breaking elements.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Arrested Yesterday for Violating Orders</p>
<p>It is said that among those arrested in the rice market yesterday for illegal transactions, in addition to a Mr. Zhang from Hong Tai, there was also a clerk from a certain rice shop. As of last night, they were still detained in the police station. The authorities may apply the measures to stabilize prices and crack down on speculation and manipulation during the emergency period. It is said that the authorities will start emergency measures to stabilize the rice market. After the arrests, rice merchants were quiet for a while, and futures prices fell to three thousand two hundred dollars, but in a short period of time, they rose again, finally closing at three thousand seven hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Method is Worth Learning From</p>
<p>All circles in this city hope that the authorities can continue to send capable detectives to secretly investigate those who hoard goods for speculation and law-breaking traders outside the market, and prevent them from secretly manipulating prices and hoarding rice. Yesterday, the reporter learned that the Hong Kong government has decided to take the following measures to manage food: (1) All food imports and exports must be reported to the authorities; (2) Exports are only allowed if the stock exceeds 500,000 bags (Note by the reporter: 500,000 bags of rice can supply Hong Kong for a year); (3) Strictly investigate unreasonable price increases. Because the Hong Kong government can effectively and strictly implement the above measures, the rice price in that area is very stable. All circles in this city hope that the authorities of the two concessions will emulate it.</p>
<p>Conflicting Opinions at Rice Industry Meeting</p>
<p>The rice price in this city continues to soar, and all parties criticize it. Public opinion is unanimous in advocating that the authorities of the two concessions should lead a large-scale investigation of the rice merchants' stockpiled rice, and severely punish them. The Shanghai Soybean Rice Industry, Rice Shop Industry, and Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Unions, feeling intense external pressure and recognizing their responsibilities, could no longer sit idly by. They held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at 15 Edward Road, attended by more than 20 people, including Fu Qian Geng, Zhang Li Zhong, Jiang Hong Bin, Yu Bin Wen, and Yan Ji Yun. Chen Zi Yi was elected as the chairman. After a long period of discussion, opinions were quite divided, blaming the concession authorities, and the motion was rejected for publication.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Transportation from Producing Areas are False</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice has been soaring, and the price of No. 2 Saigon rice is also close to 100 dollars per picul, greatly affecting the livelihoods of civilians who will soon be unable to support it. General hoarding groups disregard everything, only knowing how to make money, making money from the people's food, which inevitably has a bloody odor, using the excuse of inconvenient transportation, restrictions on exports from producing areas and Hong Kong, etc., which are all false. It has been verified that in recent times, navigation channels are smooth, transportation is convenient, and there are no export restrictions. Regarding the import of foreign rice, this newspaper's business news column has disclosed daily that from January and February of this year, 1,090,000 bags of foreign rice have arrived in Shanghai, sourced from Haiphong, Saigon, Siam, Rangoon, and Hong Kong. In this month alone, there are already more than 277,000 bags, showing a clear picture of a strong influx and sufficient inventory.</p>
<p>Bureau Discusses Management Methods</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that Shanghai's rice prices rose again this morning (14th) by three or four dollars compared to yesterday's (13th) market price, with first-grade tribute rice selling for 113 dollars per stone and domestic rice selling for 130 dollars. However, domestic rice cannot be found on the market. According to Mr. Peissle, the Information Officer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Council is continuing its efforts to obtain a satisfactory result. Undoubtedly, Shanghai does not want to have no rice at all. It is said that in the future, when rice is transported to Shanghai, the authorities may register it to know the cost of the rice, the date of transportation, the location of storage, and the name of the holder, so that they can be ordered to release it at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Three Bloody Cases Occurred Within Two Hours Yesterday Morning; Sheng Shouchen Died Immediately After Being Shot Twice; Chen Xien and Pan Shudong were Severely Injured <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Three assassination cases occurred continuously within two hours in this city yesterday morning, from 8:05 AM to 10:30 AM. One of the protagonists in the three cases has already died from serious injuries, and the other two have also been seriously injured. The details obtained by the reporter of the social news agency are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Chen Xien Chen Xien, a native of Anhui, a senior member of the Qing Gang, 63 years old, used to be quite influential in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and had many followers scattered throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Chen was originally an antique dealer. After his disciple Su Xiewen became the "Mayor of Dadao," Chen received financial assistance from Su every month and rented a house at 235 Route Maugny in the French Concession, acting as a second landlord. The ground floor was rented to Tongmao Longan, and Chen and his wife lived in the two-story building. It has been a long time since. At 8:05 AM yesterday morning, Chen was still sleeping in his room when three assassins suddenly broke into Chen's room. Two were wearing long Chinese robes, and one was wearing short clothes. One of the assassins immediately pulled out a gun and tried to fire at Chen. At that time, Chen's son-in-law, Zhu Renrui, was in the room and rushed forward to hug the assassin. The assassin fired a shot at him, hitting him in the leg and knocking him to the ground. Another assassin quickly stepped forward, pulled out a sharp axe, and chopped Chen's head four times. Three axes hit the head, and one axe hit the back of Chen's left brain, penetrating about two inches, immediately causing blood to spurt out and fainting on the bed. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the assassins fled downstairs one after another. Afterwards, the police received the news and sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Chen is now the "Executive Director of the Shanghai Charity Relief Association." It is also reported that the police have arrested a suspect in the case and are currently interrogating him.</p>
<p>Pan Shudong Pan Shudong, a native of Zhenjiang, who lived at 290 Datong Road, also known as Zhi Dong, 45 years old, is currently the Personnel Section Chief of the Huxi Guard Corps. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Pan left home in his private car. When he passed the intersection of Datong Road and Avenue Haig, an assassin suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired a shot at Pan from behind the car, hitting Pan's neck, causing him to fall on the car. Afterwards, nearby patrolmen summoned an ambulance to send him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries were serious, but there is no threat to his life.</p>
<p>Sheng Shouchen Sheng Shouchen, the grandson of Sheng Xingsun, a native of Changzhou, 51 years old, lived at 33, Lane 615, Yuyuan Road, and is currently the "First Section Chief of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Office." He used a private car, No. 721, for transportation. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Sheng left in his car. However, as soon as the car left the lane, three assassins suddenly fired two shots at him. At that time, one bullet hit Sheng's chest, and one hit his lower jaw, immediately injuring him and knocking him down in the car. By the time nearby patrolmen arrived, the assassins had already escaped. Sheng was sent to Baolong Hospital in the car, but because the injuries were in vital areas, he died within minutes of being admitted to the hospital. Sheng's body has now been sent to the mainland funeral home for preparation.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Rain Stopped Last Night and the Sky Cleared; The Full Eclipse of the Moon was Seen <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The time of the lunar eclipse was yesterday at 7:00 PM. The whole day before was raining, but it stopped towards dusk, and soon the clouds were swept away, and the moon suddenly rose. From around 7:00 PM in the evening, the full extent of the lunar eclipse could be clearly seen. However, yesterday evening's lunar eclipse only obscured one corner, and soon it became full again. It was not a total eclipse, but it was extremely spectacular.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Daylight Saving Time Implemented Tonight <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council launched the Daylight Saving Time movement last summer, various agencies, organizations, and major companies, businesses, and factories have all set their clocks forward by one hour to start work earlier, which has been quite effective in stimulating energy, strengthening physical fitness, and improving work efficiency. In order to continue to promote this, the Shanghai Municipal Council has jointly decided with the French Municipal Council, etc., to start this year's Daylight Saving Time movement from midnight today (Saturday). At that time, all clocks will be set forward by one hour, the same as last year. The two councils also hope that all sectors of the city and public and private organizations will comply with it, not only to save electricity supply, but also to increase work efficiency and promote good habits of early rising and early sleeping. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from various sources yesterday that all the banks and money changers affiliated with the Silver and Money Industry Association, as well as various foreign firms, electrical companies, and telephone companies, will all start working according to the new time at midnight today or tomorrow. The Shanghai Postal Administration also announced yesterday that it will start working one hour earlier from the 16th. As for various large and small factories, companies, businesses, etc., it is reported that the implementation will be delayed. It is also learned that the nighttime curfew in the two concessions will be enforced according to Daylight Saving Time from the 16th. After the early closing of various entertainment venues, the curfew will also start one hour earlier than the current time, and the lifting time will also be handled according to Daylight Saving Time.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Shanghai British Consulate has Telegrammed the British Government; Requesting Special Ships for Coal Transport; and Reporting on the City's Electricity Supply Situation <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>A senior official of the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that the company had asked the British Consul in Shanghai to report the city's electricity supply situation to the British Government Shipping Department in London, requesting that ships requisitioned for military use be sent to the Far East to solve the fuel shortage problem in Shanghai. It is said that the British Consulate has agreed to this request and has telegraphed the government, and the company's London office has also requested relief from the British government on behalf of the Shanghai headquarters. According to a reporter from the Greater China News Agency, the Shanghai Power Company needs 50,000 tons of coal per month, half of which is supplied by North China and India. Before the European War, the company could obtain 300,000 to 350,000 tons of coal from India every year, transported by British ships. Since the outbreak of the European War, many British ships have been requisitioned for military use. Twelve of the fourteen ships owned by the Lessees Company, which originally transported coal for the company, have been requisitioned by the British government. Unable to obtain coal from India, and Japan, due to its own fuel shortage, has ordered that North China coal be used for Japan, resulting in this serious problem. The company has repeatedly appealed to all parties for assistance, but ships from the United States and Canada have stated that "it is a pity that they cannot comply," as they often return empty when traveling to Far East ports and are unprofitable. The Japanese side also said that all of its ships are busy transporting timber from Sakhalin Island to Japan, and used the excuse of "unable to help." The only hope is the assistance of the British government. If eight ships can be built to transport coal, the difficulties can be solved easily, and the electricity reduction measures will not need to be implemented. According to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Council has not taken the same steps. The committee organized by the Municipal Council is limited to studying how to allocate electricity fairly and reasonably. He said that he would welcome assistance in solving the coal shortage problem from all parties.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Temporary Power Reduction Measures Implemented from Today; The Power Company Notified Users Yesterday; Two Restrictions on Standard Electricity Consumption <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company issued a notice to all large and small users yesterday, stating, "Due to fuel shortages and difficulties in replenishment, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially hired experts of different nationalities to conduct a detailed study on the allocation of reduced electricity supply, based on reasonable principles and considering social needs. Before this study is completed, the Municipal Council has approved the following measures, which will be implemented immediately: (1) Users whose monthly standard electricity consumption from January 1940 to January 1941 is more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours shall only be allowed to use 70 percent of their standard electricity consumption each month, calculated from the date of the company's meter reading, and charged at the prevailing electricity price (with a minimum of 1,000 kilowatt-hours). The company will notify these users of their standard electricity consumption. (2) Electricity used beyond the above limit shall be charged at three times the prevailing electricity price. (3) If users whose monthly standard electricity consumption is 1,000 kilowatt-hours or less exceed 1,000 kilowatt-hours in any month, the excess part shall be charged at three times the price of the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours. The purpose of the increased electricity charges in the above (2) and (3) is to restrict electricity consumption and save fuel. The company does not profit from this. All revenue, except for that charged at the prevailing electricity price, will be included in the "Fuel Saving Reserve," which will be used for purposes beneficial to users as agreed upon by the Municipal Council and the company in the future. During this fuel emergency, it is hoped that all large and small users will save electricity as much as possible, because unless rapid assistance arrives, the above limit will be reduced, and additional electricity charges may be increased. This is to notify you."</p>
<p>Daily Meetings to Conduct Investigations</p>
<p>The committee organized by the Municipal Council to study electricity saving, inviting experts from China, Britain, and Japan, held its first meeting at the Shanghai Power Company the day before. It is now learned that the committee convened its second meeting at the same location yesterday morning. It is said that this subcommittee meeting will be held daily, because the purpose of the committee is to investigate the electricity consumption of various industries and study universal electricity reduction measures, which is a very heavy task. It is reported that the committee has decided on several research principles, the main ones being to provide as much as possible for public utilities, public health, large industries and businesses, and businesses related to social welfare, and to limit entertainment and luxury electricity consumption as much as possible. Once a formal decision on the allocation problem is made, the temporary measures announced by the Shanghai Power Company will be announced at the same time.</p>
<p>Ice Making Approved; Air Conditioning to be Discussed</p>
<p>Since the news of the power company's electricity reduction and restriction of new users spread, various industries in the community have been rushing to the power company to apply for supply, fearing that they will not be able to obtain electricity in the future, with no less than hundreds of applications every day. The company's authorities, because the fuel source has not improved, have not approved them, but have only temporarily registered them, and will supply them when the fuel is sufficient in the future. With the weather warming up and the hot summer approaching, the ice-making industry, ice cream industry, cold storage and air-conditioning users have also been rushing to apply for power supply. According to the company, ice-making and ice cream, and cold storage industries are related to hygiene and may be approved, but air conditioning is a luxury and will be decided by the experts' meeting.</p>

<p>The Shanghai branch of the British firm Chang Hing Shipping Company officially announced yesterday morning (the 14th) that the company's trans-Pacific voyages of various mail ships would be suspended indefinitely. It is generally believed that Chang Hing's suspension of the Pacific voyages is due to repeated reports that Germany has dispatched more commerce raiders into the Pacific, and that several submarines are also believed to have entered the Pacific to assist in the attacks. This move by Chang Hing will result in the cessation of voyages to Shanghai by the three mail ships well-known to Shanghai: the Empress of Asia, the Empress of Russia, and the Empress of Canada. It is noted that these three ships were armed after the outbreak of the European War and continued to sail between the Far East and Canada. Before the outbreak of the Egyptian war, a mail ship of the Chang Hing Shipping Company carried Australian troops to the Near East. Furthermore, the Empress of Britain of the Chang Hing Company's global service was sunk by Germany in the Atlantic last year.</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies Increase Freight Rates</p>
<p>After the announcement of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese army immediately threatened to advance southward. Therefore, the European war will spread to the Far East, and the situation in the Pacific is gradually becoming tense. Britain and the United States are actively deploying defenses in the Pacific and South Seas. Therefore, all British merchant ships traveling the Eurasian route have been commandeered. The Empress ships of the Chang Hing Company on the Canadian route have also</p>
<p>should cease voyages. The British Company's London service ships only go as far as Hong Kong and have not come to Shanghai for three months. American ships on the Pacific route continue to operate as usual. The Dutch ships on the Java route nearly had their service suspended last month, but fortunately, it resumed after only one day, so there was no loss. Currently, American and Dutch shipping is exceptionally developed. According to an announcement by the Java Company, freight rates for goods shipped to Java will increase by 25% from April 1st. The African route's</p>
<p>Royal ships will also increase by 20% on the same day. It is also heard that the American President Lines will increase water rates for goods shipped from Shanghai to the United States by 10% from April 1st. Hong Kong and the Philippines will remain unchanged. According to the company, the freight rates for goods shipped from the United States to Shanghai have been set to increase by 10% from today (the 15th). The city will implement this on the first day of next month as a courtesy to customers.</p>

In the future, Chinese people going to Burma, whether by land, water, or air, must obtain passports and have them visaed by the Chinese consulate before departure.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Great America Evening News," at 4:20 AM yesterday (the 13th), the body of an American infant, only about fifteen months old, was found on the playground of the Shanghai Jewish School on Seymour Road. Officials from the American Consular Court and police officers from the Public Concession are investigating the infant's</p>
<p>circumstances of death. A private first class, Keith Men, of the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, is suspected of being involved in the case and has been detained by the U.S. military authorities pending investigation. It is reported that the U.S. authorities will perform an autopsy on the infant's body on Sunday for examination. The infant's mother, who resides at 4 Pacific Gardens, is currently hospitalized at Hong'en Hospital and is believed to be unaware of the tragic news of the infant's death. The infant's body on the playground of the Jewish School was discovered by the school's security guard and the West Sector police station of Pacific Gardens. According to</p>
<p>the doorman of Pacific Gardens, he was on duty yesterday morning when he suddenly saw a person, wearing an American military uniform, holding a bundle of clothes, coming out of house number 4. He became suspicious upon seeing this and followed him. He followed him along Seymour Road, and then saw the person turn into the Jewish School at number 445. He came out after a moment, still holding the bundle of clothes in his hands, and continued along Seymour Road. After a few steps, he suddenly stopped and threw the bundle of clothes over the wall into the Jewish School playground. Then he continued north along Seymour Road. He then abandoned following him and entered the playground, summoned the security guard of the school, and opened the bundle of clothes. To his shock, it was an infant's body. He immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for investigation.</p>

<p>At around 12:00 AM yesterday, the Tailai Taxi Company received a phone call from the Falence gambling den on Great Western Road requesting a taxi. The company dispatched driver Zhou Awu, driving car number 12102, to respond to the call. A Shanghai man named Tang Baosen (father's name: Mai Lin, age 22, residing at Lane 609, No. 63, Baker Road) got into the car. After Tang got in, he put his hand into his pocket, as if holding a pistol, and threatened Zhou. He also took off Zhou's hat and put it on his own head, and drove the car instead of Zhou. He drove from west to east, and when he reached the Bund, he forced Zhou out of the car. Tang then drove away quickly to the west. After Zhou Awu got out of the car, he shouted "Robbery!" At that time, Police Officer Lomen of the police station happened to be passing by in Tailai's official car number 12138. Upon learning the reason, he ordered the driver to chase Tang's car. The car was finally caught at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to stopping Tang's car, he immediately got out of the car and arrested Tang, and brought him back to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Dongshan and Tian Changyuan investigated and found that Tang's family was quite wealthy. It is heard that he is the young owner of a certain candle shop. The purpose of this car robbery is suspected to be to commit kidnapping. It is urgently necessary to investigate. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan requested detention for investigation before filing a lawsuit. Presiding Judge Xiao Xiefei questioned him and ordered him to be detained for further questioning.</p>

<p>Shi Yingchi, an expert in manufacturing domestic wireless radio receivers, obtained a license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and opened the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road for many years. The factory produces shortwave wireless radio receivers that can receive broadcasts from major cities in Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Europe. On July 18th of last year, a customer named Zhang Xiaotong (residing at No. 11, Chunhui Lane, Ae Erjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio receiver from the company for 180 yuan. Zhang selected it himself and was satisfied with it and took it back for use. At the beginning of August, Zhang brought the original machine back to the company, claiming that the machine did not meet the advertised performance of the company, saying that the machine could not receive Chongqing broadcasts, and requested a refund, which led to a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. After repeated trials by Presiding Judge Dong Qiming, and after a designated expert listened to it, it was indeed possible to receive broadcasts from various places. Therefore, at the end of last month, Zhang Xiaotong was ruled to have lost the case. Shi Yingchi believed that Zhang Xiaotong deliberately made things difficult. After Zhang negotiated a refund, he repeatedly made propaganda to damage the reputation of the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory. Therefore, Shi recently retained lawyer Wu Xiangxian to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Zhang Xiaotong of damaging his reputation and requesting that the case be brought to justice. The court accepted the complaint and summoned him to the eighth criminal court by Presiding Judge Zhan. Because the defendant Zhang Xiaotong did not arrive, the court ordered a rescheduling for March 21st to summon the defendant again for trial.</p>

<p>Shen Meili, a widow from Nanxiang, recently had a romantic relationship and lived together with Ye Qide, a Ningbo native who was previously an employee of the Hong Kong branch of the Central Bank. Later, the two sides' feelings broke down and they separated. Between December 31st of last year, she and Ye Pei, a fugitive, rented a room at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road, lured Ye Qide there, and used threats to extort 10,000 yuan to break off the relationship, which was unsuccessful. Zhang Fangdao, a watchman from Haimen at the Six Nations Hotel, secretly went to Ye's Dalong Cotton Mill and took away goods worth 5,000 yuan. The case was discovered, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court. After the trial was concluded, Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi ruled in the third criminal court yesterday morning that Zhang Fangdao and Shen Meili were jointly convicted of attempted extortion and sentenced to four months imprisonment each. Shen Meili's sentence was suspended for three years and she was released in court. With the attached civil suit, the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected.</p>

<p>Wang Li, a local woman, 25 years old, residing at No. 2 Wu Jia Lane, inside the Old North Gate, was found to be carrying 12 taels of opium hidden on her legs and a note stating that it should be delivered to the parlor room at No. 20, Tongkang Lane, St. Mary's Road. She was discovered yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, entering the French Concession through the iron gate on East Zilai Fire Street from the South City, by Chinese-Russian patrol officers and detectives Li Yuyuan and female inspector number 10. The detectives took Wang Li to the address and noticed five people, elderly women Zhang Wang, Li Liu, Gu Chen, Wang Tao, and a man Zhang Xishu, lying on a couch, smoking opium. They were immediately arrested. Wang Li, who was carrying opium, and the others, along with opium paraphernalia, were brought back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>— 美君</p>
<p>I left, abandoning my two-year-old Yana! Why leave? Why be so cruel?</p>
<p>I am a woman who has received a considerable education. Of course, I understand the responsibility of raising children that a mother should fulfill; I am a person with flesh and blood, a soul, and emotions, of course I also understand "mother-daughter love"; yet I left, I resolutely left: I have no attachment to anything, I am willing to keep my eyes tearful, suppress my broken heart, move forward, and walk bravely!</p>
<p>Originally, people who can't understand me will scold me for being ruthless and unrighteous, and even say that I have no conscience. In the third month after my marriage, I drove away my husband. I said to him: "You have a great future, you can't forget the mission that this difficult era has given us young people for my sake!" Sure enough, he listened to me and left. On the day we parted, we cried together and encouraged each other. After the ship sailed away, what I brought back was not the bitterness of sorrow, but the flowers of light. I said to myself, "I love my husband, but I love my country even more!"</p>
<p>In the past year or two, I have accepted the temptation of a bad environment, and I have slowly moved towards the side of decline and darkness.</p>
<p>In my family, there are parents who spend the whole year playing outside and not taking care of family affairs, an old mother who is old-fashioned but very kind and amiable, and two incompetent and cowardly younger brothers. Since my father doesn't take care of family affairs and my younger brothers are unable to support the family, I, this miserable older sister, have taken on the heavy burden of life.</p>
<p>There are really too many good people in the world!</p>
<p>One of my teachers from elementary school - a passionate person who has always been crazily pursuing me - often sends a little charitable money to my family.</p>
<p>A young bureau chief said to me: "Meijun, as long as you play with me every day, I am willing to bear all the expenses of your family."</p>
<p>Several college students, neglecting their studies every day, call me to ask me to dance, and invite me to go to the movies.</p>
<p>I respectfully refused the kindness of these good people. Because I know: If they treat me so well, what will I use to repay them in the future?</p>
<p>Let me talk about the bad environment of my husband's family:</p>
<p>My parents-in-law's faces are always stern from morning to night; my three or four sisters-in-law are either sneering or gossiping enthusiastically, and even the servants want to bully me. - When I was enduring this extreme pain, I didn't have tears, but just laughed loudly.</p>
<p>The reason why I want to leave, the reason why I cruelly abandoned my child to leave, is entirely because of the pressure of this environment. I think my leaving is right, and it is not a mistake. Just as my friend Long said in the short poem he gave me: "What is there to be nostalgic for in Shanghai? Home is a knife, the environment is a pit, the knife will kill you, the pit will bury you; Youth, fate, all are controlled by them. Go! Just go! This is a piece of darkness, and there is infinite light on the other side!"</p>
<p>Now I'm gone, I left my two-year-old Yana! When I left, Yana was still fast asleep in her dream. I think when she wakes up, she will probably cry because she has lost her mother; but mother will come back one day!</p>

<p>— 踪浦</p>
<p>The sky was so cloudy that there wasn't even a crack to look up at, just a thick expanse. Light rain was falling outside. Looking at the clock lying on the table in the room, it was already 7:20. After a hurried wash, I grabbed my schoolbag and walked out of the room. Heaven was especially unkind, the rain was falling even harder! The tram stop was full of passengers. Raindrops fell on my body, but no one showed any reaction. A gust of wind swept past, and a few raindrops blew into my collar, and I couldn't help but shiver. At the same time, I thought, "It's spring! Why is it still so cold?" I had to shrug my shoulders and shrink my head further into my clothes, looking at my blue cloth gown already covered with spots of raindrops.</p>
<p>It was with difficulty that I heard the ringing of the bell, and roused myself to prepare to rush forward! But the tram still drove past without stopping, and impatient voices drifted out from the carriage, "Full! Full!"</p>
<p>What could I do? Staring blankly at the passing tram, I subconsciously patted the raindrops on my body, and had no choice but to continue waiting as before! But five minutes later, I finally squeezed into another tram in the midst of the commotion, and felt much relieved in my heart.</p>
<p>Time really flies, and in a moment I arrived at my destination. Getting off the tram, I glanced at the clock of the shop next to the road, and it was already 7:45. Suddenly, my stomach rumbled, and I remembered that I hadn't had breakfast yet. I hurriedly stepped into a small shop, wanting to buy something to fill my stomach, but when my right hand reached into my pocket, the foot that had just stepped in shrank back in the same way. I really couldn't believe it! The "heroes of the Jianghu" even cared for people like me. I unbuttoned my coat, and took a closer look, it was true! A two-inch long cut was made on the edge of my pocket. My heart was trembling! The overcast sky symbolized my distress. A layer of dark clouds seemed to envelope my almost unconscious brain. Everything was painted in gloomy colors, and I couldn't see even a sliver of light. I seemed to vaguely remember being bumped into by someone when I got on the tram, but what use was that? In the end, I still comforted myself, "Three dollars! Isn't this a very small amount? It's only one-tenth of my monthly salary, don't be sad!" Thinking this, I walked closer to the gate with the words "×× Elementary School" written on it, and dejectedly stepped inside. Looking through the glass window of the "Office", I saw that the wall clock was only five minutes away from the start of class. Suddenly a voice called out from behind, "Mr. Lu, good morning!" "Good morning!" I turned around and smiled at them as well.</p>
<p>In that instant, I gained a different feeling. The stuffiness in my heart was diluted by the voices of the children! I patted my empty stomach and strode into the office. Brightness flashed before my eyes, and a smile reappeared on the corner of my mouth.</p>
<p>"Ah! There is also purity in this dark city!" (Paid)</p>

<p>— Jin Xie Shan</p>
<p>After reading Shan Li Jun's article, "A Woman Born in the Year of the Sheep," I couldn't help but think of my paternal cousin who was "born in the year of the Tiger."</p>
<p>My cousin is dead, and it's been almost four years now. I will never see her sad, haggard face again.</p>
<p>My cousin was "born in the year of the Tiger." If she were still alive today, she would be twenty-eight years old! But she didn't live past twenty-four before being tormented to death by the evil forces of feudalism!</p>
<p>"When a boy grows up, he should marry; when a girl grows up, she should be married," these two ancient sayings hastily ended everything for her. I remember that in the year she was twenty-three, due to "the orders of her parents, the words of a matchmaker," and coupled with the machinations of a fortune teller with a "small iron mouth," she was married to a stranger on a certain day in the eighth month of the lunar calendar that year.</p>
<p>Her tragic fate began at this time. She did not have any happy days. She once told my second younger sister, "On the third day after the wedding, the heavy work of his family began. I was busy all day, unable to breathe, but I couldn't rest even a little. My parents-in-law were always watching and pressing me sharply."</p>
<p>In less than three months, her father-in-law suddenly died of a sudden illness. Because it was not long after the marriage that a senior family member passed away, her mother-in-law's vicious and humiliating scolding resounded in her ears.</p>
<p>"Misfortunes never come singly," soon! After another two months! Her husband also followed his father and passed away one after another. What a great stimulus this was! But not only did she not receive comfort and pity, but on the contrary, she suffered even more from her mother-in-law's poisonous scolding and beatings (this time her mother-in-law even started using beating as a means).</p>
<p>"White Tiger Spirit, it's all you, this White Tiger, who has harmed people!"</p>
<p>Under the torment of a mother-in-law with old feudal ideas, my cousin was finally killed in melancholy!</p>
<h3 id="e83">Begonia <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>

<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>Ji Zhao Xiong had always known that Zhao Si was Begonia's general manager. Hearing him say this, he felt much more at ease, and a very friendly smile reappeared on his face as he happily watched Begonia get into the car and leave.</p>
<p>Back at the Tianjin Hotel, Begonia had already formed a very detailed plan in his mind.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhao Si, I need you to go out and buy me some things!" He hurriedly took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to Zhao Si. Only two daily necessities are needed!</p>
<p>"What exactly are these things?" Zhao Si asked with a blank, fat face, baffled.</p>
<p>Begonia didn't answer him.</p>
<p>"Things for women?" Zhao Si suddenly had an inspiration and understood half of it.</p>
<p>"That's right, things for women." Begonia opened a drawer and glanced at several old Chinese envelopes and a stack of Chinese stationery piled inside. "Wait, also buy some foreign stationery and foreign envelopes, be sure to pick out good ones!"</p>
<p>"What are you doing with this?" Zhao Si understood even less.</p>
<p>"The stationery and envelopes are for my own use. In addition, buy two things for women and give them to Luo...Mrs. Yuan." Begonia said, unable to restrain the very excited smile that emerged on his face.</p>
<p>"Give them to Mrs. Yuan! Twenty dollars?" Zhao Si said, looking at the bill in his hand. He thought that if Mrs. Yuan had really taken care of their affairs, with such a big matter and her lavish status, how could she be rewarded with a mere twenty-dollar gift?</p>
<p>"You don't need to worry about it! Just buy a dozen handkerchiefs and a small bottle of eau de toilette, that's enough!" Begonia was almost about to tell Zhao Si that this was the method agreed upon with Luo Xiang Qi to use as a cover. (55)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Talking about "Green Wind Pavilion" <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>The Peking opera "Green Wind Pavilion" is adapted from the "Green Wind Pavilion" legend. This play also has a Kunqu opera version, but unfortunately only one scene, "Chasing the Son," remains. Wei Qing Lin of the Kunyi troupe once learned this scene, but never performed it. However, the Southern Xiansuo Society does not have this script. A few years ago, when Wang Chuan Qian and Zheng Chuan Jian were running a waterway troupe, they collected many lost opera scripts in the Jiaxing and Jiashan areas, but they did not discover "Green Wind Pavilion." When I happened to talk to Zheng Chuan Jian about it, he didn't even know that "Green Wind Pavilion" had a Kunqu opera version. According to Wei Qing Lin, the Kunqu version of "Chasing the Son" is slightly different from the Peking opera version. In the Peking opera version, Ji Bao's biological mother, Xue Zhou Shi, sees that Zhang Yuan Xiu repeatedly refuses to agree to let her take the adopted son, so she uses a trick to lure Zhang away, falsely saying that an old woman is calling outside the pavilion, causing Zhang to run out of the pavilion. Xue Zhou Shi takes the opportunity to lead her son away in a hurry. Zhang initially thought that his old wife, He Shi, had arrived, but when he saw that there was no one outside the pavilion, he returned to the pavilion and realized that Ji Bao was gone and Xue Zhou Shi was also gone. He then realized that he had fallen for Xue Zhou Shi's trick, and she had taken away the little Ji Bao who was supposed to support him in his old age, wasting thirteen years of effort. He sadly returned to find his old companion. In the Kunqu opera version, Zhang Yuan Xiu understands that Xue Zhou Shi is Ji Bao's real mother, but he can't bear for the little Ji Bao, who is supposed to carry on the family line, to be separated from her in such a short time. In the end, Zhang knows that this cannot be forced and says to Xue Feng Ming Zhao Yang with a heavy heart, "This son is yours, how can I not let you take him away? However, we two elders hope that he will support us in our old age. Today you are taking him away, and we two elders are very grateful, because he can live a life of luxury from now on, and no longer live a life of poverty in our home." Finally, he also said to Ji Bao, "Son! Although you were not born to us two elders, we two elders have raised you for thirteen years, and we have put in a lot of effort. From now on, you are not Zhang Ji Bao, but Xue Ji Bao; you are not the child of a poor family, but the young master of a wealthy family. In the future, when you achieve fame, don't forget the thirteen years of upbringing from our two elders, and come visit us two elders. If we two elders have both passed away, I hope you can spend some money on our two elders' graves, burn some paper, and call out 'Dad, Mom' twice, and our two elders will be happy even in the underworld!" Xue Zhou Shi, who was standing by, also felt a little unbearable, so she ordered Ji Bao to bow to Zhang's name as an adopted son, so that there would be a reason for him to repay the kindness and recognize his relatives in the future. Xue Zhou Shi led Ji Bao away in Zhang Yuan Xiu's grief. Compared to the two versions, the Kunqu opera version is indeed more subtle and profound than the current popular Peking opera version.</p>
<p>Liu Jing Ran played the role of Zhang Yuan Xiu very well after Lao Tan. Tan Xiao Pei's performance of this play is very famous in the North, but in reality, Xiao Pei's spirit and movements are all terrible. In fact, Lei Xi Fu is better than Xiao Pei. Xi Fu has a poor and sour look on his face, which is most suitable for playing Zhang Yuan Xiu. In addition to "Green Wind Pavilion," "A Pinch of Snow" and "Four Jin Shi" are more pleasing to watch than Ma Lian Liang's performances. In the South, Zhou Xin Fang is the best. He Shi is an old female role, and the Zhou Chang Shan and Zhou Chang Shun brothers are both very famous. In the late Qing Dynasty, there were too few old female actors. Moreover, most of them could sing but not act, so the clown actors Wang Chang Lin and Li Jing Shan often took on this role. Now it has become a rule. In the North, Ma Fu Lu, Sun Sheng Wu, and Ying Rui Quan; in the South, Miao Sheng Chun, Jiao Bao Kui, Liu Bin Kun, and Li Han San are the ones who often sing He Shi. Among the old male roles, Li Bao Kui in the North, and Liu Yun Fang and Wu Gui Fen, the teacher and student duo in the South, can also play He Shi, and they are very good at it.</p>

<p>— Gu Ming Dao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Brave Northerners Show Their Skills</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu heard that there were thieves, shouted loudly, jumped out of bed, took his real saber, and ran out of the room. He heard the sound of metal clashing, and Xu Jing was retreating. He swung his precious saber and roared, rushing forward and slashing at the man. The man saw another helper running out of the house, his voice loud and his body strong. In the moonlight, he saw that his face was very majestic, and the hair on his chin and beard bristled. Knowing that the newcomer was not kind, he hurriedly used his hammer to parry Zhong. He felt that the saber was heavy and fast, so he didn't dare to slack off and used his own skills to resist. Xu Jing saw Zhang Cangqiu coming to help, and wanting to see his skills, he stepped aside and watched with his sword in his arms. He saw Zhang Cangqiu's precious saber flying up and down. When he used it urgently, he only saw the saber light and not the person. He secretly admired him in his heart. However, the horse thief was also very skilled, waving his double hammers like two clusters of yellow clouds, tumbling and rolling in endless battle. After fighting for a long time, Zhang Cangqiu saw that the enemy was powerful and he could not win for a while, so he couldn't help but feel a little anxious. He changed his saber technique and used the Five Hundred Styles of Subduing the Dragon Arhat Saber. This was Zhang Cangqiu's unique skill, and very few people in the martial world could do this, and it was difficult for people to resist this Five Hundred Styles of unexpected killer saber techniques. Therefore, the saber slashed horizontally and vertically, expanding into a large arc and pressing towards the man. The man was unwilling to retreat and resisted bitterly, fighting for more than fifty rounds. There was a clang, followed by a dong, and the hammer in the man's left hand had been cut on the ground by Zhang Cangqiu's precious saber, cutting off the hammer head. The man was shocked, shook the stone hammer, jumped out of the circle, turned around and jumped out of the short fence, and fled as if flying. Zhang Cangqiu was not willing to let him go, so he jumped over the fence and chased after him. Xu Jing also opened the door with his sword and ran out. He saw the man running along the small river to the north. Zhang and Xu chased forward one after the other. The man saw someone chasing behind him, suddenly turned around and threw a cold light at Zhang Cangqiu. Zhang Cangqiu tilted his head to the side, letting the enemy's weapon pass by, and shouted loudly, "The enemy is releasing hidden weapons!" But Xu Jing was behind him, unprepared, and did not see it. By the time he heard Zhang Cangqiu's shout and wanted to dodge, the hidden weapon had already reached him, hitting his left shoulder squarely. He immediately felt pain deep in his bones and shouted loudly, falling to the ground. It was a small sleeve arrow. (12)</p>

<p>Some people encounter setbacks in their struggles and think that this is their fate. So they follow the wind, sincerely submit, become decadent and complacent, and are content with adversity.

<h3 id="e88">"Miss Nana" <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Li Du</p>
<p>After watching Queen Victoria in "Sixty Years Under the Curtain," and then watching Miss Nana in "Miss Nana," we have to praise the British star Anna Sten for her superb acting skills.</p>
<p>The story of Miss Nana is basically a fantasy, a farce, absurd, but very cute. Lauren Young is a wealthy man who is afraid of his wife. After losing money once, his wife only gave him ten dollars a week for spending money. His mistresses didn't know the truth and wanted to extort him, threatening him wantonly. Fortunately, his niece, Miss Nana, stepped forward to help her uncle out of trouble. However, this niece, as the advertisement says, is a "mouth saying no, no, no, but heart saying yes, yes, yes" little girl, and she herself is caught in the web of love and cannot extricate herself. In the end, of course, everyone has their own love and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>After watching such a story, we can only "leave the script aside." As for the performance, it is consistent with the Hollywood comedy style: the humor of the dialogue, the lightness of the tone, all give the audience a pleasant feeling; there are also "songs and dances," "eroticism," and "comedy," especially the grandeur and magnificence of the song and dance scenes, and the novelty and uniqueness of the lens angles, make this film particularly beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>Anna Sten's Miss Nana is played very cutely,娇憨活泼，烂漫天真. Lauren Young's lecherous uncle is also just right. Victor McLaglen doesn't have many scenes and has no place to use his talents, but Lee Carleson has a very good performance. In short, this is a bowl of "Hollywood cream soup."</p>
